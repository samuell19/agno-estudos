- IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE HOW ALL THE TROUBLE STARTED. I WAS JUST A COURT STENOGRAPHER... BUT I'D ALWAYS WANTED TO BE A WRITER. AND TO WRITE A GREAT NOVEL, YOU HAVE TO LIVE A GREAT NOVEL. SO I TOOK TWO WEEK'S VACATION IN MALTA TO WRITE MY FIRST BOOK. UNTITLED MYSTERY, BY MICKEY RAYMOND. HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD A COURIER HAD BEEN MURDERED. A PRIVATE DICK-- NO, THAT'S EMBARRASSING. A PRIVATE EYE WAS HEADING FOR MALTA. SHE'D PACKED LIGHT--JUST HER BRIEFCASE AND HER WINDBREAKER. NO, SHE WOULDN'T WEAR A WINDBREAKER. THAT'S IT! [overlapping conversations] EXCUSE ME. - I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE THAT YOUR LUMBAR FAVORS AN ANTERIOR ACCESS. - BEG YOUR PARDON? I BET YOU HAVE LOWER BACK PAIN AT THE END OF THE DAY. - WELL, YES, SOMETIMES IT DOES GET A LITTLE SORE. - AHA. ANYBODY EVER LOOKED AT IT? - NO. YOU A DOCTOR? - [clears throat] JUST CALL ME TERRY. I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN PEOPLE GIVE ME SPECIAL TREATMENT JUST BECAUSE OF WHAT I DO. MAY I? - MM... - AHA. - HMM. - HIS STRONG FINGERS WERE LIKE PROBING RODS SEARING PASSION INTO HER HUNGRY, CRAVING FLESH. - LUMBAR AXIAL DEFORMATION. - HE LIED... - YOURS IS MINOR. - HUH...WHAT SHOULD I DO? - SIMPLE THERAPY. STOP BY 23B AND I'LL SUGGEST SOME EXERCISES. - OH, WELL, THANK YOU, DOCTOR. - UH... - TERRY. - SHE MOANED WITH MOUNTING PLEASURE. BUT THE DEFROCKED DOCTOR CARED NOT FOR THE CONTESSA'S ANIMAL LUST. IT WAS THE HEAT OF HER SWISS BANK ACCOUNT THAT DREW HIM LIKE A MOTH TO HER FLAME. HE WAS THE VILEST OF VILES. - HI THERE. - HELLO. - GOING TO MALTA? - NO, ACTUALLY, I WAS GOING TO THE BATHROOM. - [chuckles] YOU GOT ME. WORK? - I DON'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IT. - PARDON ME. - WHY NOT? - IT EMBARRASSES ME WHEN PEOPLE GIVE ME SPECIAL TREATMENT FOR WHAT I DO. - AH, WELL, THEN I'M SURE YOU WON'T MIND. I WAS AHEAD OF YOU. - SCRATCH ROMANCE. - LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO LUQA AIRPORT. THE LOCAL TIME IS 9:58 A.M. IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE SERVING YOU, AND I HOPE YOU'LL ENJOY YOUR STAY IN MALTA. THANK YOU. [speaks Maltese] - HAVE A NICE DAY. GOOD-BYE. - BYE-BYE. - BYE. BYE-BYE. - BY THE WAY, YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO BE LAYING OVER HERE, WOULD YOU?

[chuckles] - MISS RAYMOND, I-- I THINK I SHOULD WARN YOU... THIS MIGHT NOT BE THE RIGHT HOTEL FOR YOU. IT IS, UH...VERY QUIET. - OH, THAT'S JUST HOW I LIKE IT. [ding, thud] THAT'S JUST HOW I LIKE IT. I'M SORRY. - VERY WELL. I AM THE MARQUIS DE PENA. THIS IS THE FALCONRY, MY ANCESTRAL HOME, ORIGINALLY BUILT IN THE 17th CENTURY AS A SPORTING LODGE BY GREAT, GREAT, GREAT, GREAT, GREAT, GREAT GRANDFATHER, THE GRAND MASTER DE PENA.

I CAN GIVE YOU A DEAL ON ALL OF THIS JEWELRY THAT YOU CANNOT BELIEVE. WHERE YOU GONNA GET A PRICE LIKE THIS ANYWHERE ELSE? [sighs] WHAT AM I GONNA DO, MAKE THE FIRST SALE FOR YOU? EXCUSE ME, SWEETHEART, CAN I BORROW YOU AND YOUR BEAUTIFUL FACE JUST FOR A SECOND? - NEIN. - NEIN? - HEY, BABY, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, YOU'RE A TEN AND A HALF, HEH HEH. I'M GIVING THIS THING TO YOU FOR FREE. COME ON, DO ME A FAVOR AND ACT LIKE YOU LIKE IT. SMILE. - IDIOT! SEE? SHE LOVED IT. NOW, HOW HARD WAS THAT? IT WAS SIMPLE. - MOONLIGHTING... DOCTOR? - NEVER MIND ABOUT HER, LISTEN... - WELL, I GUESS I SHOULDN'T EXPECT INSPIRATION TO COME UP AND GRAB ME FROM BEHIND, BUT NOTHING EVER HAPPENS IN MALTA. [siren wailing] - LOOK, GIRL WALKING DOWN THE STREET WITH HER HAND ON THE STRAP OF HER BAG, OKAY? AN EASY MARK. - MARK? - UH...PIGEON? A SUCKER? - AN UNWITTING VICTIM? - VERY GOOD. YES. OKAY, NOW, YOU BE THE GIRL, OKAY? YOU STAND OVER HERE AND WALK ALONG REALLY SLOW. OKAY, THE GUY SNEAKS UP FROM BEHIND, PICKS UP THE BAG, TAKES THE WEIGHT OFF THE SHOULDER. SNIP, SNIP. GOOD-BYE PURSE. - AMAZING. - WHAT'S SO AMAZING. IN HONG KONG THEY COME UP TO YOU, THEY GIVE YOU A SHOT OF NOVOCAIN IN THE REAR END, AND THEY WALK ALONG WITH YOU FOR A BLOCK OR SO TILL IT TAKES. AND THEN, I TELL YOU, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE MUCH OF A PICKPOCKET TO GET A WALLET. - AH. SERGEANT, HAVE YOU EVER IN YOUR LIFE HEARD SUCH A THING? - NO. WE MUST BE VERY PROVINCIAL HERE IN MALTA. IN MY EXPERIENCE, OUR PICKPOCKETS HAVE SIMPLY... PICKED POCKETS. MISS RAYMOND, I SUGGEST YOU GO BACK TO YOUR HOTEL. I WILL ALERT MY MEN TO THIS UNUSUAL SITUATION, AND PERHAPS SOMETHING WILL TURN UP. - PERHAPS SOMETHING WILL TURN UP? THAT'S REAL AGGRESSIVE POLICE WORK, FELLAS. THAT'S GREAT. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? EVERYTHING I HAD WAS IN THAT BAG. MY WALLET, MY PASSPORT. [sighs] LOOK, I DEMAND TO SEE SOME MUG SHOTS. - MUG SHOTS? MISS RAYMOND, I WOULD BE ONLY TOO HAPPY TO LET YOU LOOK AT THE MUG SHOTS. - IN FACT, I WOULD EVEN PUT TOGETHER A LINEUP. - GREAT. - ONE SMALL PROBLEM, MISS RAYMOND. HOW CAN YOU IDENTIFY SOMEONE YOU DID NOT SEE? OR MAYBE YOU KNOW SOME NEW TECHNIQUE THEY USE IN HONG KONG TO ACCOMPLISH THIS? - [chuckles] - MALTA WANTS ME DEAD: AN ORIGINAL STORY BY MICKEY RAYMOND. CHAPTER ONE. THE INSPECTOR WAS A DIM BULB. IF YOU LOOKED UP "STUPID" IN THE DICTIONARY, YOU'D FIND HIS PICTURE. [tough male voice] HELLO, SWEETHEART. - SHH! DON'T SCREAM... MICHELLE. - HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME? GET OUT OF HERE. - HEH HEH. [speaking Maltese] MMM... [speaking Maltese] MMM... YOU ARE MUCH PRETTIER THAN YOUR PASSPORT PICTURE. [mumbling in Maltese] WHERE IS IT? AAH! AAH! AAH! [faint squeak] [faint squeak] HEEEELP! - OH, MY GOD! [siren wailing] - MISS RAYMOND. QUITE A DAY FOR YOU. - THIS WOMAN'S OUTRAGEOUS. - I DIDN'T MEAN TO THROW HIM. HE ATTACKED ME. IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE. - YOU MUST ARREST HER! - ME? - I COULD HANG MYSELF FOR ALLOWING HER - I SHOULD HANG MYSELF FOR NOT GOING TO CLUB MED! - ONE MOMENT! PLEASE. - ALL RIGHT. - MISS RAYMOND, LET'S SEE IF I HAVE THE STORY. NOW, EARLIER TODAY, A MAN STEALS-- YOU SAY A MAN STEALS YOUR PURSE. NOT TWO HOURS LATER, HE SHOWS UP IN YOUR CLOSET. HE THREATENS YOU WITH A RAZOR. - YOU SPRAY DEODORANT INTO HIS EYES. YOU PUSH HIM OUT OF THE WINDOW. HE FALLS TO HIS DEATH... THREE STORIES BELOW. IS THAT APPROXIMATELY IT? - THAT'S IT EXACTLY. YES. - NO. YOU SEE, THERE'S ONE LITTLE THING MISSING FROM THE STORY. - WHAT? - THE BODY. - I--I TOLD YOU THAT THE BODY WENT OVER THE BALCONY. - SIT DOWN, PLEASE. YOU SEE, MY MEN HAVE SEARCHED HIGH AND LOW AND CAN FIND NO TRACE OF THIS FELLOW WITH THE GOLD TOOTH AND RAZOR. - LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND HERE... - MISS RAYMOND, I BEG TO DIFFER. I THINK THAT YOU AND YOU ALONE KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON AROUND HERE. SERGEANT. YOU SEE, I HAVE JUST BEEN READING A FASCINATING NEW BOOK. - OH, SHIT. - THE TITLE... MALTA WANTS ME DEAD. HMM. "AN ORIGINAL STORY BY MICKEY RAYMOND." THAT'S YOU. - I DON'T SEE WHAT THAT'S GOT TO DO WITH ANYTHING THAT'S GONE ON AROUND HERE. - EVERYTHING. BECAUSE YOU SEE, MISS RAYMOND, WHEN YOU KNOW HOW THIS STORY ENDS, THIS CASE WILL BE CLOSED, AS THEY SAY. - I THINK YOU'RE A LITTLE CONFUSED. THAT'S FICTION. AND WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE IS REALITY. - OH...OF COURSE. I'M SORRY. YOU'LL HAVE TO FORGIVE THE OLD INSPECTOR. WHAT DO I KNOW? I AM ONLY... "THE CHIEF FLATFOOT WHO WOULDN'T KNOW A CLUE IF IT JUMPED UP AND BIT HIM ON THE TAIL." - GIVE ME MY BOOK! - SIT DOWN. - [chuckling] - SERGEANT... I WOULD NOT BE SO AMUSED. YOU..."THE DIMWITTED RIGHT-HAND MAN "WHO LOOKS LIKE HE COULD TAKE A PAYOFF BETTER THAN HE COULD TAKE A PUNCH." - GIVE ME MY BOOK! - SIT DOWN! - INSPECTOR, IF IT WOULD TAKE A PAYOFF TO GET THIS--THIS TRAMP OUT OF MY HOUSE, I--I WOULD BE GLAD TO MAKE YOU THE OFFER. - OH, THAT'S VERY GENEROUS, MARQUIS. BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARY. AFTER ALL, WHAT'S ONE MORE TRAMP... [chuckles] "IN A FLOPHOUSE RUN BY A MARQUIS WHOSE TITLE WAS AS GOOD AS FIVE-DAY-OLD FLOUNDER"? - SHE'S THE ONE WHO SHOULD HAVE GONE OUT OF THE WINDOW! - NO ONE HAS GONE OUT OF THE WINDOW. - SIT DOWN, PLEASE. - I-- AND YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE ME LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT! - NO, NO, IT IS YOU WHO ARE TRYING TO MAKE ME LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT. YOU THINK YOU CAN COME TO THIS COUNTRY AND TREAT US LIKE FOOLS? YOU WASTED MY TIME THIS AFTERNOON, AND NOW TONIGHT. - IT HAPPENED. IT REALLY HAPPENED! - YES. IN YOUR MIND! WHICH, IF YOU PERSIST IN THIS CHARADE, I WILL BE FORCED TO HAVE EXAMINED. - MM! - YOUR BOOK. - WAIT, INSPECTOR, STAGNOS, I DEMAND THAT YOU TAKE THIS WOMAN OUT OF MY HOUSE! - I'VE PREPAID. - SHE'S PREPAID. GOOD NIGHT... FLOUNDER. [classical music playing softly] - GOOD MORNING. - GOOD MORNING. - I'M LIZZY O'REILLY, AND THIS IS MY HUSBAND SEAN. - HOW DO YOU DO? - WE CHECKED IN THIS MORNING. BEEN HAVING A NICE HOLIDAY? - ACTUALLY, I CAN'T WAIT TO GO HOME. - REALLY? HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE, MY DEAR? - ONE DAY. [both chuckling] - YOU REALLY SHOULD GIVE MALTA MORE OF A CHANCE. - AND I DON'T RECOMMEND SITTING AROUND THE HOTEL WITH A BUNCH OF OLD FOGIES. - IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL DAY. GET OUT WITH YOU. - GO ON, NOW. OFF WITH YOU. [laughter] [kids laughing] - OOH! - OSCUSI. SCUSI. [speaking Italian] - UH, JE NE PARLE ITALIANO. - WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT THE SEA IS ALMOST AS BEAUTIFUL AS YOU. ALMOST. NOT QUITE. ALMOST. I ANSWER TO MYSELF NINO. NINO TENUCCI. - THAT'S NICE, NINO. - DO YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BODY? HOW DO YOU SAY? WONDERFUL. MAGNIFICO! FANTASTICO. - FAT-O. - ARE YOU CRAZY? PLEASE.

MAYBE YOU SHOULD TAKE ANOTHER LOOK JUST TO MAKE SURE. - IF I TAKE ANOTHER LOOK, I'LL BE SICK. - HIS NAME IS HARRY BENJAMIN. AN ENGLISHMAN WITH MALTESE SAILING PAPERS. A SHIP'S COOK. - [screams] - OBVIOUSLY, HE COOKED UP MORE THAN CHIPPED BEEF. - I DIDN'T-- I DIDN'T KILL THIS GUY. - NO. YOU KILLED... THIS GUY. THIS GUY KILLED THAT GUY. WE MATCHED THE TOOL TO THE JOB. ESTEBAN ORTEGA. A BASQUE JAI ALAI PLAYER. MY CURIOSITY GETS THE BETTER OF ME. I HAVE TO SAY TO MYSELF, "WHAT DOES A BASQUE JAI ALAI PLAYER, "AN ENGLISH SHIP'S COOK, AND AN AMERICAN WRITER HAVE IN COMMON?" - I'M GOING TO THROW UP. - NOW, I AM NOT NAIVE. - I-I--I'M GOING TO THROW UP. - MALTA HAS A VERY BUSY SEAPORT. SAILORS IN, SAILORS OUT. A SHIP FROM THE ORIENT. DRUGS. A COURIER... A SUPPLIER... A CUSTOMER. YOUR FRIENDS IN THE LITERARY CIRCLES BACK HOME EAGERLY AWAIT... [sniffs] THE DRAGON. - YOU'RE CRAZY. - WHERE DID YOU PUT THE DRUGS? - I WOKE UP IN THE LUXURY SUITE AT THE GRAY BAR HOTEL. IT WAS THE KIND OF PLACE WHERE YOU USE YOUR ONE PHONE CALL TO CHECK IN WITH DIAL-A-PRAYER. [indistinct chatter] - I'M NOT ASKING. I'M DEMANDING TO SEE MY WIFE! - I AM COMMANDING THAT YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH FOR ONE MOMENT. - I BET YOU'D LIKE THAT, INSPECTOR STAGNOS, BUT I WON'T. NOT AS LONG AS INTERNATIONAL LAW STANDS BY A FEW TRAMPLED PRINCIPLES LIKE HABEAS CORPUS, FLAGRANTE DELICTO, EX POST FACTO, AIN HOC SIGNO VINCES. MISS RAYMOND, I GOT HERE AS SOON AS I COULD. - EXCUSE ME, PLEASE. DO YOU KNOW THIS MAN? - UM-- - WHY WOULDN'T SHE KNOW HER OWN LAWYER? - HE'S MY LAWYER. - INDEED. - MISS RAYMOND, I'LL HAVE YOU OUT OF HERE IN A MOMENT. - YOUNG LADY, I AM RELEASING YOU. BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF ANYTHING THIS IDIOT HAS SAID. IT'S JUST THAT I'M NOT PREPARED TO BRING FORMAL CHARGES AGAINST YOU...YET. - AND WE ARE NOT PREPARED TO BRING FALSE ARREST CHARGES AGAINST YOU...YET. YOU ALL RIGHT? DID HE ROUGH YOU UP? ANY RUBBER HOSES? ANY OF THAT KIND OF STUFF? HUH? COME ON. NOW'S THE TIME TO TALK ABOUT IT. - THEY TREATED ME VERY WELL, THANK YOU. [under breath] WOULD YOU PLEASE SHUT UP? - ONE MOMENT, MISS RAYMOND. THIS AFTERNOON, YOUR PASSPORT AND TRAVELER'S CHECKS WERE DISCOVERED IN A GARBAGE BIN. - WHERE'S MY PASSPORT? - MISS RAYMOND, YOU ARE STILL UNDER SUSPICION. IT'S BETTER THAT I KEEP IT JUST FOR SAFE KEEPING. - THIS AN AN OUT-- - AM I FREE TO GO, INSPECTOR? - OF COURSE, MISS RAYMOND. BUT NOT VERY FAR. - THAT WAS GREAT, WASN'T IT? - GREAT?

THOUGHT MAYBE YOU COULD USE A FRIEND OR SOMETHING. WHERE YOU GOING? - I'M GOING BACK TO THE HOTEL. AND I'M GONNA LOCK THE DOOR. I'M GONNA GET IN MY BED. I'M GONNA STAY THERE. - WANT COMPANY? I MEAN FOR DINNER. I GOT MY CAR RIGHT HERE. DRIVE YOU BACK TO THE HOTEL, CHANGE, GRAB A BITE. I MEAN, YOU GOT TO EAT, RIGHT? LOOK, I MIGHT BE WRONG, BUT COME ON. IF I JUST PUSHED A GUY OUT OF MY BEDROOM WINDOW, I WOULDN'T WANT TO GO BACK AND LOCK MYSELF IN THE SAME BEDROOM AND STARE OUT THE SAME WINDOW ALL NIGHT LONG. HMM? - [sighs] - WELL... THAT'S ONE DEAD SOLDIER. OOPS. SORRY. I THINK YOU'RE FEELING A LITTLE BETTER. I DETECT A LITTLE COLOR IN THOSE CHEEKS. - YOU DETECT A LITTLE MAKEUP IN THOSE CHEEKS. - WHATEVER. WHERE WAS I? - I THINK YOU WERE WITH THE PEACE CORPS IN MALAYSIA. - OH, RIGHT. NOW I DON'T WANT TO TOOT MY OWN HORN HERE, BUT IN 1968 I HAD TAKEN MY MOUNTAIN TRIBESMEN AND MOVED THEM FROM THEIR HUNTER-GATHERER PHASE INTO AN ORGANIZED AGRARIAN SOCIETY. I HAD TAKEN THEM UP FOUR CENTURIES UP THE ANTHROPOLOGICAL LADDER IN ONLY TWO YEARS. - HOW DID YOU MANAGE THAT? - WELL... I GUESS IT WAS MY RAPPORT WITH THE NATIVES. - NO, I MEAN-- I MEAN, HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO DO THAT THE SAME YEAR THAT YOU WERE WRITING SPEECHES FOR MCCARTHY AT THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION? - UH... RIGHT.

I MEAN, YOU RAISE IT TO THE ART OF ZEN. - I'LL TAKE THAT AS A COMPLIMENT. - DO YOU EVER TELL THE TRUTH? - LOOK... YOU DON'T TELL HER THAT YOU DROPPED OUT OF COLLEGE, YOU DROVE A CAB FOR SIX YEARS, AND YOU WOUND UP SELLING JEWELRY FOR YOUR UNCLE. I THINK YOU'LL ADMIT THAT SOMETIMES THE TRUTH CAN BE PRETTY TEDIOUS. - WHEN YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT. - SO WHAT DO YOU DO? - I'M A WRITER. EH, THERE MIGHT BE A BOOK IN IT. - AW, COME ON. THERE'S A BOOK IN IT ALL RIGHT. THE QUESTION IS, "AM I GONNA BE IN IT?" - WHY WOULD YOU BE IN IT? - BECAUSE I'M THE GUY THAT SPRUNG YOU FROM JAIL. - I THINK, UH, YOU'RE THE GUY THAT ALMOST KEPT ME IN JAIL. - HOW ABOUT THE GALLANT GENTLEMAN, WHO IN YOUR HOUR OF NEED WINED YOU AND DINED YOU? - WE SPLIT THE CHECK.

YOU GOT A CUTE LITTLE ASS. - [laughs] - ARE YOU TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ME? - I'M MAKING YOU MORE COMFORTABLE. - WHY DON'T YOU TRY KISSING ME FIRST? - OKAY. - THAT'S NOT A KISS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - CLOSING THE CURTAINS. - WHY? - I'M SHY. - OH. NOW WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - WHAT DO YOU THINK I'M DOING? - I THINK YOU'RE TAKING TOO LONG. - TELL ME ABOUT THE ARABS. - THEY CAME HERE TO GO THE AUCTION, AND THEY BOUGHT A BOAT, AND I REALLY LIKE YOU. - WHY DO THEY WANT TO TALK TO YOU, MICKEY? - THEY THINK ORTEGA GAVE ME TEN KILOS. - DID HE? - NO. - HE MUST HAVE TOLD YOU SOMETHING. - HE TOLD ME... I WAS PRETTIER THAN MY PASSPORT PICTURE. - COME ON, MICKEY, TRY HARDER. HE MUST HAVE TOLD YOU SOMETHING ELSE. - I'M TIRED. - MICKEY? MICKEY? DAMN. - AND IF WE FAIL? - WE WILL NOT FAIL. DO WE NOT STILL HAVE THE JUDAS BOAT? SHE'LL BRING THE OTHERS OUT, THEN WE WILL ELIMINATE THE COMPETITION AND RETURN TO OUR BROTHERS LIKE ISHMAEL WITH THE PRIZE. - LET US SHARE A LITTLE SMOKE. IT WILL PUT OUR MIND TO REST. [explosion] [clang] - OH! - MICKEY. - G-GOOD MORNING. - YOUR NICE YOUNG MAN STOPPED BY THIS MORNING AND MADE US PROMISE WE'D LOOK AFTER YOU. COME AND JOIN US. - THANK YOU. - SEAN, ASK THE WAITER TO BRING THE GIRL A NICE GLASS OF ORANGE JUICE. - COFFEE, THANK YOU. - COFFEE, SEAN. - [snaps fingers] - THANK YOU. - YOUR TERRY, HE'S A GEM. LOOK WHAT HE GAVE ME. - THAT'S VERY NICE. - I SAY MARRY THE BOY. - HE'D BE QUITE A CATCH. - WELL, UH-- WE'VE ONLY KNOWN EACH OTHER THREE OR FOUR DAYS. - I PROPOSED TO LIZZY THE DAY I MET HER. 35 YEARS. - OH, MY GOD. - I THINK IT'S WORKED OUT RATHER WELL. - THESE MEN. - OH, YES. SEAN AND I SAW THAT VERY SAME BOAT WHEN WE TOOK A TRIP TO THE BLUE GROTTO YESTERDAY. WE THOUGHT, "WHO COULD AFFORD SUCH A GRAND BOAT?" - PETROL LEAK, THEY SAY. - I NEED THIS. - HI. - OH! - YEAH, I JUST CAME BY TO SEE IF YOU WERE FEELING ANY BETTER. - TERRY, YOU GOT TO TAKE ME TO THE POLICE RIGHT NOW. - YOU'RE NOT FEELING BETTER. - NO, LOOK, LOOK. THESE ARE THE GUYS THAT I TOLD YOU THAT KIDNAPPED ME YESTERDAY. LOOK. - I THOUGHT YOU WERE WITH ME YESTERDAY. - NO, BEFORE I WAS WITH YOU. - WELL, WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT THIS FIRST? - NO, YOU GOT TO TAKE ME TO THE POLICE RIGHT NOW! - OKAY, BUT LET'S GO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA SAY FIRST. - OKAY. - YOU KNOW WHAT STAGNOS IS GONNA SAY? - NO, WHAT? - "YOU'RE UNDER ARREST." - WHY WOULD I BE UNDER ARREST? - HE THINKS THAT YOU'RE DEALING DRUGS. HE DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU KILLED ORTEGA IN SELF-DEFENSE AND NOW YOU'RE ADMITTING YOU'RE THE LAST ONE TO SEE THE ARABS ALIVE. YOU LIKE JAIL? - YOU'RE RIGHT. I CAN'T GO TO THE COPS. I'D BE THE PERFECT FALL GUY. - AND A PATSY. - YEAH. - OF COURSE, IF YOU KNOW WHERE THE TEN KILOS WAS, YOU COULD CRACK THIS CASE YOURSELF. - YEAH, BUT I CAN'T FIND THE TEN KILOS UNTIL I FIND OUT MORE ABOUT BENJAMIN. - YEAH, THE WOLF RAT. - RIGHT. - WELL, YOU SPREAD A FEW SMACKERS DOCKSIDE, YOU MIGHT GET THE RIGHT ANSWERS TO THE RIGHT QUESTIONS. - THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. COME ON. LET'S GO. - [chuckles] - WHAT'S SO FUNNY? - [chuckles] I WAS KIDDING. THAT'S DIME-STORE DETECTIVE STUFF. DON'T YOU GET IT? - YEAH, I GET IT. YOU'RE MAKING FUN OF ME. - COME ON, LIGHTEN UP. - LIGHTEN UP? SOMEONE TRIED TO KILL ME, I GOT KIDNAPPED, I CAN'T LEAVE THE COUNTRY, AND THE COPS WON'T HELP ME. YOU LIGHTEN UP! - SO NOW YOU'RE GONNA PLAY DETECTIVE? - I'M GOING TO PLAY DETECTIVE BECAUSE I'M REALLY TIRED OF BEING THE VICTIM. ARE YOU GONNA HELP ME OR NOT? - WELL, IF YOU'RE GONNA BE A GOOD DETECTIVE, THEN YOU WOULDN'T NEED ANY OF MY HELP. - I ALWAYS KNEW YOU WERE A WIMP. I DECIDED TO GO IT ALONE. PRETTY BOY HAD BEEN RIGHT ABOUT ONE THING. A GOOD PRIVATE DICK DOESN'T NEED ANY BRASS BAND TAGGING ALONG, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT WAS THE DICK'S HEAD ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK. [horn honks] - HELLO. MAY I OFFER YOU A LIFT? PARDON ME, THIS MAY BE NONE OF MY AFFAIR, BUT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT YOUR FRIEND TERRY. - HE'S NOT MY FRIEND. - AH, GOOD! THEN YOU DON'T MIND ME TELLING YOU THAT THIS TERRY PROPOSITIONED ME SEVERAL TIMES. - COMING FROM HER, THAT WAS PRETTY TOUGH TO BUY. - OF COURSE, I WAS COLD AS ICE. - I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN, BUT I REALLY DON'T CARE. - YOU'RE RIGHT. MEN ARE NOT WORTH AGGRAVATION. SAY, WHY DON'T WE HAVE LUNCH? THERE'S A BOUILLABAISSE I'VE BEEN WANTING TO TRY. - UH, SOME OTHER TIME, EVA, OKAY? - IF THERE EVER IS SOMETHING YOU WANT TO DO WITH A FRIEND, COME TO ME. WE WOMEN SHOULD STICK TOGETHER. - THANKS FOR THE LIFT, EVA. I'LL GET OUT HERE. [indistinct chatter] EXCUSE ME, SIR. I NEEDED INFORMATION FAST. AND I KNEW HOW TO GET IT. YOU HAD TO BE TOUGH AND YOU HAD TO TALK THEIR GUTTER LINGO. EXCUSE ME, SIR. SIR? COULD I ASK YOU A QUESTION, PLEASE? [indistinct chatter] UH, SIR? [whispers] DID YOU KNOW A GENTLEMAN NAMED HARRY BENJAMIN? - NO. - HEY, MR. LADY, YOU SHAVE YOUR LEGS? [laughter] - IF THESE JOKERS WANTED TO PLAY ROUGH... MICKEY RAYMOND WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO GIVE 'EM A FEW LESSONS. I GOT A FIN FOR ANYBODY IN HERE WHO KNEW HARRY BENJAMIN. - WHAT'S A FIN? - FIVE BUCKS. - WHAT DO YOU CALL TEN? - UH...A SAWBUCK. - I KNEW BENJAMIN FOR A SAWBUCK. I COULD JUST TAKE IT, YOU KNOW? - TELL YOU WHAT, WHY DON'T I GIVE YOU FIVE NOW AND FIVE LATER? - DEAL. - HARRY BENJAMIN'S LAST SHIP. SOMEONE SHOULD HAVE TOLD HIM ABOUT THE SURPRISINGLY AFFORDABLE CRUISERS ON THE ROYAL VIKING LINE. SOMEONE SHOULD HAVE EXPLAINED TO HARRY BENJAMIN ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU START MESSING - WEIGH ANCHOR, YOU BLOCK OF WHALE PARTS. THAT'S IT. - WHAT'S IT? - THE LAST HOME OF HARRY BENJAMIN. - I HATED TO ADMIT IT, BUT I WAS STUMPED. MY ONLY LEAD HAD LED ME RIGHT TO A DEAD END. IF THERE WAS A FAIRY GODMOTHER FOR PRIVATE DETECTIVES, I WISH SHE'D DROP A CLUE MY WAY FAST. BINGO. "HARRY, MY LOVE... "THERE'S A PLACE FOR US. "SOMEWHERE A PLACE FOR US. PRINCESS AIDA." DO YOU KNOW HER? AIDA STRUTTED HER STUFF EVERY NIGHT AT A SLEAZY JOINT IN THE SEAMIEST PART OF TOWN. I WAS READY FOR SOME SERIOUS THINKING, BUT MY SIXTH SENSE TOLD ME THAT MY THOUGHTS AND I WEREN'T ALONE. I WAS BEING FOLLOWED. THE HAIRS ON THE BACK OF MY NECK WERE STANDING UP LIKE SOMEONE WAS PLAYING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM. I'M NOT ONE TO BE SCARED OF MY OWN SHADOW, BUT WHEN THE SHADOW'S A GUY WHO KEEPS DUCKING INTO DOORWAYS, I'LL MAKE AN EXCEPTION. HAVE YOU GOT A BACK DOOR? - YES. - COULD YOU UNLOCK IT FOR ME, PLEASE? - YES. AH! - SHH. DON'T SCREAM. - YOU WERE FOLLOWING ME! - I KNOW. AND SOMEONE IS FOLLOWING ME. LISTEN, WE MUST GO SOMEWHERE AND TALK. WHAT I KNOW MIGHT SURPRISE THE HELL OUT OF YOU. I GOT MUCH INFORMATION. I GOT PHOTOGRAPHS. - I GOT A PHOTOGRAPH OR TWO MYSELF. - THEN WE HAVE A DEAL. YOU HAD THE LAST, UH, INTERVIEW WITH ORTEGA. WHAT DID YOU LEARN? - I KNOW THAT HE WAS AFTER THE TEN KILOS. - [scoffs] OF COURSE EVERYBODY'S AFTER THE TEN KILOS. CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT MUCH PLUTONIUM IN THE HANDS OF THIS MAD MAN? - PLUTONIUM? - HUH? - [clears throat] WITH THAT MUCH PLUTONIUM, I COULD MAKE A BOMB. - WELL, YEAH. NOT A GREAT BIG BOMB. ONE ABOUT THE SIZE OF HIROSHIMA. I HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU. LOOK AT THIS. - WHAT DO YOU THINK DID THAT? - YOU COULDN'T BLAME THEM FOR STICKING AROUND TO ADMIRE THEIR WORK. YOU RECOGNIZE THOSE TWO? MM-MMM. - DON'T STRAIN YOURSELF. I GOT SOME BLOW-UPS FOR YOU. VOILA. - EVA WERNER. - BETTER KNOWN AS FRAULEIN NACHT. - SO SHE DID IT, HUH? - WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM A FRIEND. VOILA. - TERRY. I DON'T BELIEVE IT. - OH, COME ON. CARA MIA, DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY. HE'S A SLIPPERY ONE. HE TRIED TO WIN ME OVER TOO. HE--HE GAVE ME THIS. I'LL TAKE IT. BUT I SEE THROUGH HIM, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? NOW WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME? LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS HERE, EH? - I DON'T KNOW. - COME ON! I TELL YOU EVERYTHING I KNOW, YOU TELL ME NOTHING? WHAT IS THIS A PHOTOGRAPH OF? HMM? A PHOTOGRAPH. CLICK, CLICK. - OH, YEAH. - LET ME SEE. WHAT IS THIS? PHOTOGRAPH OF A STRIPPER. - THAT'S HARRY BENJAMIN'S GIRLFRIEND. SHE WORKS AT THE NIETZSCHE. - I TELL YOU WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO. YOU AND I, CARA MIA, WE GONNA GO SEE THIS PRINCESS AIDA. WHY DON'T YOU PAY THE CHECK, HUH, WHILE I GO TO THE BATHROOM? YOU KNOW, I DRANK TOO MUCH BEER. YOU KNOW? - SCRATCH TERRY LEONARD OFF MY DANCE CARD. AT LEAST I COULD COUNT ON MY LITTLE ITALIANO. UNDER ALL THAT BRASS WAS ONE HEART OF GOLD I COULD TRUST TO STICK BY ME. NINO? NINO? NINO? [sighs] JESUS, NINO. SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE BATHROOM? EUROPEANS. - [groans] - OH! - [shouting] YOU STABBED HIM! - NO, I DIDN'T! - SOMEONE CALL THE POLICE. SHE KILLED THIS GUY. - LET GO OF ME! - STOP! STOP HER! - OPERATOR! OPERATOR, GET ME THE U.S. EMBASSY. IT'S AN EMERGENCY! JUST GET IT! HELLO? HELLO? CAN I PLEASE TALK TO THE AMBASSADOR? THIS IS AN EMERGENCY! NO, YOU GOT TO HELP ME! I HAVE TO TALK TO HIM! I AM CALM! OH, ALL RIGHT THEN. ALL RIGHT, JUST GIVE HIM THIS MESSAGE. TELL HIM THAT THERE ARE TERRORISTS ON MALTA [Star and Stripes plays over phone] DON'T PUT ME ON HOLD! [siren wails] [indistinct chatter and cheering] I HAD TO GET TO AIDA. SHE WAS MY ONLY LINK TO THE PLUTONIUM. [cheers and applause] [glass shatters] - HEY, YOU RUMMIES, GET AWAY FROM THERE. I TOLD YOU BEFORE. GET AWAY OR I'LL BREAK YOUR NECKS. [cheers and applause] [cheers and applause] [gun clicks] - GO ON. YOU WANTED TO GO IN, DIDN'T YOU? [cheers and applause] SHH. WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT? - WELL, I'M LOOKING FOR PRINCESS AIDA. - WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM HER? - I WANT TO TALK TO HER ABOUT HARRY BENJAMIN. - OH. GO ON. - LOOK, I REALLY HAVE TO TALK TO THE PRINCESS. I'M IN TROUBLE. - SIT DOWN. - WILL THE PRINCESS BE BACK SOON? - SHE'S HERE. SURPRISED? - WELL...YES. - EVERYONE WAS. THEY COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT I SAW IN HIM. BUT HARRY WAS SPECIAL. [crying] - LOOK--LOOK, I'M SORRY ABOUT THE-- - THAT'S ALL RIGHT. - LISTEN. WHERE DID HE PUT THE PLUTONIUM? - YOU KNOW... I WARNED HIM WHEN HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO STEAL THE STUPID STUFF. BUT HE WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME. THE BIG DUMMY. - PRINCESS, TEN MINUTES, PLEASE. - THANK YOU. - [sighs] PRINCESS, THINK. I MEAN... WAS THERE A MAP? WAS THERE SOMETHING? - HE SAID THERE WASN'T A MAP, BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT. HE SAID AFTER HE HAD THE MONEY, HE WAS GOING TO TAKE ME AWAY FROM ALL THIS... TO THE SOUTH OF FRANCE. HERE. LET ME SHOW YOU. HMM? THIS IS THE PLACE. - THAT'S VERY PRETTY. - LOOK AT THEM ALL. RIO, TAHITI, GREECE. HE WAS ILLITERATE, YOU KNOW? BUT HE LEARNED TO WRITE MY ADDRESS, SO WHEREVER HE WAS, HE'D SEND ME A POSTCARD... - JESUS, THAT'S IT! - TO LET ME KNOW HE WAS THINKING OF ME. - THE POSTCARDS! THE MAP IS ONE OF THE POSTCARDS! - HE DIDN'T HAVE TO WRITE. - NOW BACK AT THE HOTEL-- - A POSTCARD SAID IT ALL. - HEY, PRINCESS, I GOT TO RUN. - WAIT! BE A DOLL. ZIP ME UP. - SUCK IN. - I'VE GOT TO GO ON A DIET. [gunshots] - AH! GET DOWN! - ♪ STOP ♪ ♪ IN THE NAME OF LOVE ♪ ♪ BEFORE YOU BREAK MY HEART ♪ [cheers and applause] ♪ BABY BABY I'M AWARE ♪ ♪ OF WHERE YOU GO ♪ ♪ EACH TIME YOU LEAVE MY DOOR ♪ ♪ I WATCH YOU WALK DOWN THE STREET ♪ ♪ KNOWING YOUR OTHER LOVE YOU'LL MEET ♪ [music fades out] - OH! DAMN IT! ARGH! - I ALWAYS TELL MY CLIENTS, "WEAR COMFORTABLE SHOES WHEN YOU TRAVEL." WELL, I'M OFF TO PICK UP YOUR POSTCARDS. - DON'T SHOOT ME! DON'T SHOOT ME! DO YOU REMEMBER YOU ONCE SAID TO ME IF I EVER NEEDED A FRIEND, THAT I COULD-- WELL, I KNOW THAT IT'S KIND OF LATE, BUT I SORT OF FEEL LIKE SOME BOUILLABAISSE. - I ALREADY ATE. - WELL... "VE VOMEN" SHOULD STICK TOGETHER, HUH? WE COULD BE PARTNERS. - FUNNY. THAT'S WHAT YOUR ITALIAN FRIEND SAID WHEN HE WAS BEGGING FOR HIS LIFE. BUT I'M NOT MUCH FOR SHARING, ESPECIALLY WITH A BRIGADE LED BY SOMEONE AS DISORGANIZED AS NINO'S KNIDNAPPER. YOU PROBABLY THOUGHT HE WAS A REPORTER AND BY THE WAY, IF YOU'RE TRYING TO TRIP ME, DON'T BOTHER. - GUESS PARTNERS IS OUT, HUH? - THE ONLY PARTNERS I CARE FOR ARE SILENT PARTNERS. [gunshot] OW! [grunts] - MICKEY, WAIT! - ♪ MARTA ♪ ♪ WITH YOUR FRAGRANCE DIVINE ♪ - SEAN, YOU'LL WAKE THE WHOLE HOTEL. THE MORNING BRINGS OUT THE THRUSH IN ME. - PSST! SHH! - WELL, WELL, MICKEY. - WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL NIGHT? - AYE, YOUR BOYFRIEND WILL WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT TOO. - HE'S BEEN UP ALL NIGHT WAITING FOR YOU. - I KNOW AND, UH... I DON'T WANT HIM TO SEE ME LOOKING LIKE THIS, YOU KNOW? - SAY NO MORE. - WILL YOU HELP ME? - OF COURSE. - OKAY. MY NOTEBOOK IS ON THE WRITING TABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF MY ROOM. INSIDE IT ARE SOME POSTCARDS. WILL YOU BRING THEM TO ME, PLEASE? - YES, AND DON'T SAY ANYTHING TO TERRY. - YEAH, BUT, I DON'T-- - LIZZY, GO! YOU MUST. - MICKEY... ARE YOU IN SOME KIND OF TROUBLE? - MORNING, LIZZY. - MORNING! I, UM-- I'M JUST GOING UP FOR MY SHAWL. CHILLY OUT THERE. - DID YOU FORGET SOMETHING, LIZZY? - FORGET SOMETHING? - YOUR SHAWL. ISN'T THAT MICKEY'S? - SHE LOANED IT TO ME TO READ. - REALLY? YOU KNOW, LIZZY, I KIND OF HATE TO SAY THIS TO A SWEET LITTLE OLD LADY LIKE YOU, BUT I THINK YOU'RE LYING. - BAH! I'VE NEVER BEEN-- - WHERE'S MICKEY? - SHE'S GOING TO BE VERY, VERY ANGRY WITH ME. - WHERE IS SHE, LIZZY? HI, SEAN. WHERE'S MICKEY? - MICKEY? - YEAH, YOU KNOW, THAT CUTE LITTLE KID THAT PUSHES GUYS OUT OF WINDOWS? - OH, THAT MICKEY. SHE'S RIGHT BEHIND YOU. - MICK... I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU. - YEAH, SURE YOU WERE WORRIED ABOUT ME. YOU WERE WORRIED THAT I'D GET THE PLUTONIUM FIRST. - GIVE ME THE GUN, MICKEY. - FAT CHANCE. GET OVER. - YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE. - THE ONLY MISTAKE I MADE WAS IN TRUSTING YOU. GIVE ME THE POST-- GIVE ME THE POSTCARDS. - YES, BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF THIS. - NEITHER DO I. - SEAN, ALL YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT THIS MAN IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. AND IF HE MOVES...SHOOT HIM. - BUT, MICKEY, WHAT DO THE POSTCARDS HAVE TO DO WITH THIS? - ONE OF THESE POSTCARDS IS A MAP TO SOME STOLEN PLUTONIUM. - [chuckles] DO YOU BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE HEARING, LIZZY? [laughter] - OH, SEAN. WHAT A PAIR OF OLD FOOLS WE MAKE. - I WENT THROUGH HER ROOM TWICE AND IT WAS RIGHT UNDER MY NOSE THE WHOLE TIME. BENJAMIN'S MAP. [laughs] - OH, NO. NOT YOU TWO. I LIKED YOU. - [sighs] DID ANYONE EVER TELL YOU WHAT A GREAT JUDGE OF CHARACTER YOU ARE? - I SUPPOSE YOU'RE THE ONES THAT SENT OUR ARAB FRIENDS TO THAT GREAT SAND DUNE IN THE SKY, HUH? - THEY SAY IT IS QUITE MAGNIFICENT. - UNFORTUNATELY, WE COULDN'T WAIT UP FOR IT. PAST OUR BEDTIME, YOU KNOW. - I HOPE THESE KNOTS ARE TIGHT ENOUGH. - WHAT DO YOU NEED WITH ALL THAT PLUTONIUM, ANYWAY? - HAVEN'T YOU HEARD THE SONG LONDON BRIDGE IS FALLING DOWN? - OH, WE WOULDN'T WASTE IT ALL ON ONE BRIDGE. - LOVE TO HAVE A LITTLE CHAT, BUT REALLY MUST BE ON OUR WAY. - SEAN, DON'T YOU JUST LOVE THESE LITTLE KITCHEN TIMERS? - THAT'S A LOVELY LITTLE JOB. - SO HANDY. [ticking] TA-TA. - CHEERIO. [Mickey struggling] - KICK THE TABLE. - LOOK, I'M AN AGENT FOR THE NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION. I'M A GOOD GUY. YOU GOTTA BELIEVE ME. - I DON'T BELIEVE ANYTHING YOU SAY. - KICK THE TABLE OR MR. PEABODY'S GONNA BE EATING DRY CAT FOOD FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE! THAT'S WHAT YOUR LANDLORD'S FEEDING HIM, YOU KNOW. - I HAD THE BOYS BACK HOME CHECK UP ON YOU. NOW, WOULD YOU KICK THE TABLE, OR WE'RE GONNA DIE IN HERE! - UNH...UNH! UNH! YOU...UNH... - HOW LUCKY FOR US TO HAVE SUCH AN EXCELLENT TOUR GUIDE. EH, SEAN? - YES, DEAR. UH, I HATE TO BE A BACKSEAT DRIVER, BUT COULD YOU LEAN ON IT A WEE BIT, OLD BOY? - [grunting] WHERE DO YOU GET OFF THINKING YOU CAN USE SOMEONE LIKE YOU USED ME? - YOU WERE MY ONLY LEAD. I COULDN'T LET YOU GO. - UNH! - AAA--AAH! OH, JESUS! OH, A FATE WORSE THAN DEATH. - HONEY, CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS WHEN WE GET HOME? JUST GRAB THE SHEARS. - I GOT 'EM. - OKAY, OKAY. CUT...JUST THE ROPE! - HOW DISAPPOINTING. NOT A PEEP. - PITY. - I DEMAND TO KNOW WHAT IT IS YOU ARE DOING! - AHH. - WATCH OUT. UNH. WHAT ABOUT ME? [explosion in distance] - WHAT WAS THAT? - [chuckling] I SUPP-- I SUPPOSE IT WAS YOUR GREENHOUSE. - AND IF I KNOW THE WAY LIZZY SETS A CHARGE, PROBABLY A BIT OF THE HOTEL AS WELL! [laughter] - OH...YOU VANDALS! - MORNING. - WHEN THOSE MORNING GLORIES BLOOM, THEY REALLY BLOOM. - UNH! UNTIE ME. I CAN WALK FOR MYSELF! OOH! - OKAY, NOW ALL WE GOTTA DO IS FIND MR. AND MRS. POTATO HEAD. - WOULD YOU PLEASE UNTIE ME? I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU'D BE INTERESTED IN KNOWING WHICH POSTCARDS I HAD? - OH, THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BE TAKING INVENTORY. GET THAT. [blips and beeps] YOU WIRED EVERYBODY. - GOT A SAYING IN THE JEWELRY BUSINESS. SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE CAULIFLOWER, BUT EVERYBODY LOVES CARATS. EVERYBODY EXCEPT YOU. YOU NEVER WORE YOURS.

GO, THOUGH, YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE FERRY. - AND WHAT A MARVELOUS DAY FOR A BOAT RIDE, EH, SEAN? - HOW'D YOU KNOW WHO THE OTHERS WERE? - I DIDN'T. [matching beeping] I JUST TAGGED EVERYONE THAT CAME INTO CONTACT WITH YOU AFTER YOU HIT THE FRONT PAGE. - GEE, I SURE APPRECIATE YOU LETTING ME IN ON IT. - YOU DON'T GET THIS JOB UNLESS YOU CAN KEEP A SECRET. - OH, GOD, GO EAST. EAST, THEY'RE HEADING EAST. GO EAST! [tires screech] JEEZ. - NOT BAD FOR A WIMP, HUH? - I'M NOT SORRY I SAID THAT. - OKAY, OKAY, I DESERVED IT. I SAID SOME THINGS ABOUT YOU THE OTHER DAY THAT I DIDN'T MEAN. BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WHEN YOU TRACKED DOWN PRINCESS AIDA, THAT WAS GOOD. IT WAS REAL GOOD. - THANKS. - [calling out] - OOPS. LOOK WHAT WE GOT HERE. SORRY, MICKEY. - OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME, PAL. I'VE SEEN A LOT WORSE DRIVING THAN THIS. I'M FROM FRISCO, REMEMBER? [tires screeching] - OH-HO. WE'VE GOT A TAGALONG. - WHO IS IT, DEAR? - IT'S OUR YOUNG FRIENDS. - FROM NOW ON, SEAN, I THINK I'D BETTER DO THE KNOT TYING. [gunshots] - AAH! - AAH! - HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE. EH? - OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE SHOT! OH, I'M GONNA THROW UP. - MOVE OVER. [machine beeping] - OH, GEE--OW.

TURN LEFT RIGHT DOWN HERE. LEFT. HIT THE BRAKES! - AAH! - AAH! - WHAT HAPPENED? - I SAID THE BRAKE... NOT THE CLUTCH. [siren wailing] - I WAS PRETTY HAPPY WITH THE WAY THIS CAPER HAD COME OUT. AND SO WAS MALTA. STAGNOS FINALLY THANKED ME FOR WISING HIM UP TO MODERN POLICE METHODS. OF COURSE, HE MADE SURE THAT HE COPPED ALL THE GLORY. ALL I COPPED WAS A HANDSHAKE, AND A CARD EVERY CHRISTMAS. DIDN'T HEAR MUCH FROM THE OTHER LOOSE ENDS. WHEN THEY PULLED SEAN AND LIZZY OUT OF THE DRINK, THEY PUT 'EM IN A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD DRIP-DRY... AS FOR TERRY LEONARD, WE'D MADE A PRETTY GOOD TEAM. BUT YOU CAN'T TEACH AN OLD DOG NEW TRICKS. I LIKED WORKING ALONE. THE FEELING WAS MUTUAL. HE HAD A RIDDLE TO SOLVE IN TANGIERS. THAT'S THE LAST I EVER SAW OF HIM. - [sighs] GIVE ME A BREAK. I CAN'T SLEEP WITH ALL THAT CLACKING GOING ON. WHY DON'T YOU COME TO BED. - ALL RIGHT, YA BIG GORILLA.
