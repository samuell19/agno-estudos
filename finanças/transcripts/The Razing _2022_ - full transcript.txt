Huh. Wow. Well, it's nice to see you, too. Yeah, what do we got here? Well, where's Linc? Late. He'll be here. Lawyer. Yeah... In some parts of the world, this... this would be considered a form of sadistic torture. Being stuck in a room with people you hate? And what are you? Hmm? I mean, come on. How long are we gonna do this? Hmm? Hey. Yeah. Yeah. Don't let me stop you. Come on. I never do. Ray? What now? It's just one night. We can do this. Yeah, Ray. Dig that hole. Prove you're not that kid anymore. Core. Guys. All right, so this is Clare. Thanks for letting me crash your party. Uh, when Ray told me it was your birthday, I didn't want to impose. But Ray's pretty convincing. That he is. Jeez, man, how many pills did you feed her? I didn't pick you as the party type. Inside joke. Well... who's hungry? This birthday boy is famished. I should've brought a gift. Aw... Clare Bear... y'all are the only gift I need. You know, he's... he's never gonna change. Right? I don't know why you care so much. I don't. Yeah. Keep telling yourself that and... you might just believe it. You should know. So, how did y'all meet? We went to school together. - Oh, childhood friends? - Mm-hmm. You have to forgive Ellie. She has a habit of being too nice. Friends is quite the stretch. No, we were friends. We were more than that. Still are. But let's be honest. We were only friends with you because we wanted to get with you. And he just wanted a ride to graduation with little Miss Honor Roll here. Looks like you are the common denominator again, Ellie Bell. - Fuck you, Core. - Ah. Spoken like a true friend. You guys do this every year. Why? Now, that... is the million-dollar question, Clare. You always find the smart ones, don't you? So... who wants to take this one? Huh? Anybody? No? Well, then, I guess it's over to me. We made a pact, okay? Can we drop it now? Please? Are you guys for real? Linc said you guys were self-absorbed, but... this is next level. The world's fucking ending and all you guys can think about is some... bullshit high school drama. The world's not ending, hon. - Don't fucking patronize me. - Who's patronizing? And why are you so sensitive? It's not my fault you can't tell the difference between your life and a fucking Halloween prom. Halloween prom? Really? We're really gonna go there again? They were human beings burnt fucking alive. You were not there. How do you know? You think those photos are real? There's too many of them not to be. Why are you embarrassing me? Why did you brought me here? Because you said you wanted to... Mm, people do a lot of things for clicks. But those people, ones left over, you heard what they saw. What they think they saw. They're merely delusions. Those people need help. Delusions to the point that families are killing each other. Killing their children... so they don't have to go through what they think they saw? I don't think so. Those families were cults. And yes, mass suicides are a result of shared delusions. They weren't all cults. Yeah, listen to Corey. He knows all about that mental health shit. How long did you spend at that mental institution? - Ray? - What? Months, wasn't it? Ray Burn, for the last mother effing time... I took a leave of absence in my junior year for medical reasons. Whoo! Guys, did you hear that? "Medical reasons." I had a minor physical ailment. That's it. So, pipe down, boy band. I know they say fake it 'till you make it, but sometimes a man's got to admit that he just doesn't know shit. And he never will. And you've got a long way to go... 'till you're even close to being a man, that is. So, how soon 'til judgment day? You know what? I... I do... You guys go back to talking about whatever it was you were talking about. I'm serious. How long do you think we have? A week? Two? It's not judgment day. They're calling it "The Razing." You're smarter than this, Ellen. Am I? See, I thought I was, but now I'm not so sure. See, I don't believe in God. Never had. Neither do the kids I teach. They're just kids, they believe in Santa, for God's sake, which I guess it's the same thing. So, when one of them writes a poem about his dad, that's not dad, standing over his roasted mom... His mom, who moments before was on fire burning alive while his father held her... His mother wept as she screamed. And... and what? You think he was some sort of messiah? He was a wife beater. That poem is called Domestic Abuse. Is that what my student called it? He called it Backward Rainbow because that is what this guy looked like after his mom died. Just as his dad picked him up to hug him, just as... the same dad who hugged his burning mother, the same dad whose own skin was blemish-free. And you saw that? I saw him and there was not one burn on him. I saw his son scared to death of him and even more scared of CPS when they came to court. Seriously, Ellie, you should be up for tenure, not deciphering the tales of fourth graders. Once upon a time, there was a fucked-up kid. The end. Maybe. But maybe... just maybe... we have to admit that maybe we don't know shit. Maybe we are all just getting what we deserve. We? It's fine. It's fine. She's fine. Everything's fine. She doesn't look fine. How the fuck would you know? You... you... you... You waltz back in here like... like you're some hero, some knight in shining shit, and... and she just laps it up like you've never burned her before. Like you're not gonna do the same thing again next week, next month, next year. Because she knows that after you are gone, I will still be here to bandage her up, to pick her up. So, yeah, I think I know when she's fine. And she's fine. We are fine. What the fuck? Fucking breaker. I just wanna be alone, okay? Why the hell did you do that? Do you? Do you really? 'Cause... 'cause if you don't, this place, and with him, it's not where you wanna be. And if you do wanna be alone, then you better get used to this room, because this is as close to them as you're ever gonna get. Why do you bother? Why don't you just... Leave? - We made a pact. - Pact. Was it worth it? I used to think so. I've never been the sentimental type. You know, birthdays, holidays. I really could give a shit. When I was a kid... when I met them, I was... I was going through a lot... with my mom. I ran away a couple of times. Anyway, it got bad. Got to a point where I... I didn't even wanted to be found. But when that lot showed up... I realized you can still be alone... even when you're not. And to me... at the time... in some weird, screwed-up way... it felt a lot better than being alone. So, you stayed? I stayed. So, does it still... feel better? You tell me. What happened with your ma? So, you're coming? I think I'm gonna wait it out too. Jeez! What a great duo. Order everything extra crispy. You and Milo might wanna watch that. You know that stick you and Corey share, it's getting higher up in your ass these days. You might wanna watch that. Someone's gotta have some fun. This is a party. Hey. Hey, how's Clare? El? El? What? Come here for a sec. One sec. We have to open your gift. I didn't get you a gift. Your gift. Ellie? Your turn. Your order, ma'am. On today's menu, we have True Blue and Winter Wonder. Why do you even ask? She always picks True. Shouldn't everyone? Nah, I have hope my little Ellie will go for a little fun one day. What she wants instead of what she needs. The way he leads away from you. Hey. Anyone wanna hear today's specials? I see red. Courtesy of Mommy dearest. These little beauties will show you everything you can ever be. Your motherfucking destiny, baby. Bullshit. Hey, don't knock it 'til you try it. Try anything. Bullshit. Your loss, loser? So, what did you see, loser? Nothing I already didn't know. I don't even lie. All right. Okay. There. Done. Surprise. Surprise. Yeah, Ray, don't start. Those are what? Where did you put them? Seriously? Oh, come on. Yeah, come on, Ma. Don't you guys read anything? The experiments are dangerous. - Don't mess with them. - Come on. Do the Blue. You don't get it. These new batches are so strong. You won't be able to tell the difference. The trip, what's real, what's not. - It's all the same. - What's the point, genius? This isn't some fucking chem lab! We play it safe. You know the new stuff's fine, right? My ma tested it. On who? You? No offense, Linc, but hasn't your mom lost it? And I don't just mean all credibility and credentials. I meant she's bat shit cray. It's cool. I shouldn't have said that. Your mom's always been good to us. You got it right the first time. I was just shocked that you used the word "cray." Maybe I took a red one by mistake. Maybe you should. I come in peace. Funny. Nothing ever is with you. Tell me... did you ever have a sense of humour or... were you born this way? Tell me, do you ever take anything seriously or are you numb to all emotion? Oh, yeah. Tell me, do you feel anything? Like, anything at all? Well... wait... you don't think I'm shallow, do you? Hollow. You are so freaking empty. Like there's nobody inside. Just some mask, shell, a Halloween costume. Some... stranger inside. Well... tell me how you really feel. You first. Which pill did you roofie her with this time? Please tell me it was the snow. My heart can't take another Blue. Core? Core? Don't fucking "Core" me, Clare. Hey, what the fuck is wrong with you, man? What is your fucking problem? What did you take? I didn't. Did you take anything? It seems like the only one who's doing stuff here is you. - I don't do that shit. - Uh-huh. Don't do what? Where did you get these? I haven't seen these in years. 'Cause they got banned. I always save it for a rainy day. Bullshit. You save these to fuck with us. That is rich coming from you. You've been fucking with her for 15 years. But that's Ray for you. To a T. Never accepting responsibility. And... and don't act like you're not the first to call shotgun any time I bring out the gear. If you had it your way, you'd be tripping in your sleep. Yeah, well, not all of us are born with everything, you silver-spooned bitch. You think you know me? You think you know me? You've never known me! None of you have. Damn! You guys are a buzzkill. Is this your doing? Huh? Who's ready to party? Party's over. Hey. Are we okay? You know, the thing with the Blue, it... they're nothing, right? Ray was just... He was pissing me off so it was the first thing on my mind. - I missed you. - I missed you too. It doesn't matter. Yes, it does. Why won't you tell me? There's nothing to tell. You're sick, Core. Do I look sick? Oh... You're trying to keep all the fun yourself, are you? Actually, I thought we could do it together. Two tickets... to Wonderland, my lady. Whoa! Wait up. Josh, whatever. Whatever, Josh. J. So, where's the snow at? You've got it. Nah, this is that heavy shit we did at Linc's place. I want them Winter Wonder dreams, baby. AKA Illusions. Potato, pot ah to. Yeah. My bad. - I know your type. - Oh, enlighten me. You're scared of what you'll see. You're scared of what you want. But, hon, nothing's ever as bad as it seems. You're not as bad as you seem. Then you ain't seen nothing yet, hon. Be still, my heart. Taking off and it just might. Well, aren't you all just a bundle of killjoys? You know, you've got some real balls for an uninvited guest. This is the one? And what one would that be? - Can we talk? - Can we not? Core? We're not doing this anymore. Doing what? Playing pretend. You pretend that you're happy. I pretend that I make you happy. We both know the truth. You do make me happy. That's something I've never done and we know it. I thought it was me. I used to do everything I could to hide pain from you. I got so good at it, yeah. You didn't even know I went through chemo. What? And there it is. That look I never wanted. Core, why didn't you... Why didn't I tell you? Why would I? Why would I wanna have you look at me the same way that my father looked at my mother before she died? Have you detest me even more than you already do? - That's not fair. - Fair? You have no right telling me what is or is not fair. If I had told you, I would have lost you like I have now. I would have lost you before I ever had you. I'm so sorry. I didn't know. You never do. That's because I bore all of your pain... while you all ignored mine. And you know what the worst part is? It was all for nothing. Because you'll never be happy. Ellie Belie... you don't have it in you. Damn it. Ow. Watch it. Hurry up. I'm trying. Yeah. Where'd you get that antique from? You know me. Fuck something borrowed, something new. Give me something old, something blue any day. You better watch what you say, boy, or I'll throw you back where I found you. Well, you don't believe me? - Sure, babe. - Oh, don't "babe" me. I'm not. And no, you don't believe me. Whatever. Okay. It doesn't matter. We you doing this or what? Or what? Maybe you'll start believing me when I stop paying your rent. And what do you think about that? What are you fucking looking at? I think you forgot... where you came from. You see that? You fucking see that? That there is proof. Hey, you're checking that? Don't you forget that. Turn the fuck over. Respect your elder. Hey. Oh, what have you got there? Don't tell Corey. Uh, never do. Which one should we take? You should get some rest. We should take the red one. It's pretty. That's because it's the most dangerous. The beautiful ones always are. Well, I guess they're all pretty dangerous. Truth lies in destiny. What do you think you want? What you really want... and who you are. - Say "Ah." - Not that one. - Wait. - Not that one. Who would have thought that you and I would be so alike? What are you afraid of? You first. What's so funny? You sound like... someone I used to know. Sometimes you think you're fine. But you left it all behind you, that sadness, that fear. But you only feel that way because you've been running for so long. So long that you're too afraid to look back. But one day when you run out of steam, one day those tears catch up to you. And that sadness... that fear that you've ignored for so long will be right in front of you, staring, waiting. You can't run from who you are. Not for long. Looking for an escape, too, which I think you want? I know what I want. What's wrong? Is this you? What did you do? Where's Milo? How the fuck should I know? Stop fucking... I'm not fucking with you! Who the fuck did this? Fuck, cry me a river, Linc. You didn't give two shits about that kid, okay? Next week, you're going to be over or under your next high school grad. Or dropout. What the hell is wrong with you, you piece of shit? Ho-ho-ho, that's rich coming from you, you fucking lowlife pedo. It's happening? He was right. Milo was right. It's begun. Fixed it. Let's just call it in. Call it in? No, thanks, 5-0. If it's... if it's really happening, then... If? It's really happening. Then we're not the only ones going through this. This... this isn't our fault. If it's really happening, why call anyone? We'll all join Milo soon, anyway. Where is Milo? I... I told you, he's... he's gone home. You told me a lie. Not like that's the first time. She's... she's... she's drunk. I'm not drunk. Even the little things upset her. She... she can't even watch the news. Look who's grown a conscience. You know, dating a good person doesn't make you one too. Seriously? Now? Being a decent human being doesn't work by association. You would know. Actually, no, I wouldn't. Look at the company I keep. I'm going to bed. Maybe I'll get lucky and fall into a dream. No offense, but if this really is our last night, your faces aren't exactly what I wanna go out seeing. I'm pretty sure that was meant to be offensive. I don't want it to end this way. I don't want it to end. Say something. Say something! You're the only person I have left. You know who was there for me when I was diagnosed? George. Bateman. Your lawyer? Every event in my life, important or not... he's the only one that's been there. But does it even count... when the only person who's been there for you is only there because your family paid him to be? When you've been cheating death for so long... surfing the line between for so long... you begin to see things that others don't. You wanna know what I see about you, Ellen? I see that you're in the wrong room, because I'm not the only one you have left. Shouldn't you be with your families? Shouldn't you? Well, aren't we just a herd of black sheep? My hero. Always so protective. My parents were like that too. Always telling me what I should do. What's expected. I feel like... like I never grew up. I still feel like that. That scared kid scared of everything. Of myself. But the funny thing is... It's really so funny that... It's so funny how I don't even know who I am. I don't even know what that means. They always told me that it didn't matter... that I don't matter. But the problem is... The problem is when you don't know who you are, you start to feel like you don't exist. Ellie? I was just gonna, uh, go to the bathroom. Me too. I've always wanted a girlfriend. You've never had a girlfriend? I've never really had friends. So that's one hell of a date you got there. Hm, yeah. Wait, what do you mean? Well, you know, I mean, it's just not... It's not what you really go for. Well, I mean, that's the point. So what did you see, loser? Nothing I already didn't know. I don't even lie. All right. Okay. There. Done. - Surprise, surprise. - Yeah. Ray, it's hard to start. Oh, lambchop. Lambchop. Is that mine? You fucking little freeloader. All up in my shit, tripping on my shit. What fucking good are you anyway? Hey? Did I tell you why I call you Lambchop? - Yeah, Ma. - Shut your fucking mouth! Did I say you could speak? Sit down! I said sit down! Sit your ass down! This is my story. My story. One night, one shitty fucking night, while I was walking home from university, walking down this this shitty ass street... ...when I heard you, a tiny, tiny little baby crying. No, no, wailing, wailing. I heard you wailing like a lamb being slaughtered. And... and what did I do? What did I do? I asked you a goddamn question! What did I do? You took me in. That's right. I... took you in. Every inch of your life, every ounce of your being is only there because I allowed it to be. Don't you forget that. I should have left you where I fucking found you. They don't pay me enough for this shit. Raised you on my own dime. No one helped me. That's what you get for trying to help somebody. Fuck off! Nothing. Nada... is what I should have named you. I tried to name you after someone great. Tried to give you a chance, that's all. But nada's what you'll always be. I can't change your destiny. Not yet anyway. Your mom's out on the couch again. She can't move much these days. Circle of life, huh? The mother becomes the baby? - Soon, you're wiping her ass. - I don't think so. Tell my cousin that. It happens to all of us. No, not me. I... I think that's enough of that. So fucking Lincoln. Always thinks he's above everyone else. - No, that's not true. - No? No. I just don't want to be like everyone else. Oh, so you don't want special treatment, then? Guess you wouldn't want these test answers for next week's final. Guess you wouldn't want these. - You know the deal. - It's all on the table. - It's all I have. - It's not enough. I can get you more at a party tonight. So, you're coming or what? Hon, it wouldn't be a party without me. Are you okay? You don't gotta do a taste test. You should not gonna know the difference after half a 12-pack. But unless you wanna prolong your pain in hers, I would recommend doing a different type of poison. An entire pharmacy at your fingertips. Why plan a murder when you've got a suicide note? Apathetic. Go with the benzos. They're perfect for a drunk with a death wish. I missed you. I missed you too. It doesn't matter. Yes, it does. Why won't you tell me? There's nothing to tell. You're sick, Corey. Do I look sick? Oh! Trying to keep all the fun to yourself. Are you? Two tickets... to Wonderland, my lady. Whoa! Wait up. So, where's the snow at? You've got it. Nah, this is that heavy shit we did at Linc's place. I want them Winter Wonder Dreams, baby. Oh, baby. You and the clink over there may rule your... whatever shithole you guys are from. When you're in my house, know when to shut up. This is the one? Yeah, and what one would that be? You really don't know, do you? You're really that cliché? You daddy's boys are all the fucking same. Fancy and empty, just like this sweet pad. Isn't this supposed to be a birthday party? Pretty sweet birthday party. No family, no friends. He has friends. He has us. Does he really? Are you really? So, prove it. - A game of True Blue. - No, I don't do that shit. You was about to do that shit with your missus just before. That was different. Why? Because your shithole is shinier than ours? You think you're better than us? He didn't say that. Nah, but he meant it, though. He meant it. There's always exceptions to you lot. Rules to suit you. And so, what if we do? What's it to you, huh? Do I tell you how to live your life? Do I get in your face and remind you of all the shit that you were born with and wanna forget? I think I remember you doing exactly that. Give me the snow. It's yours. Ladies first. One for me. Any day? Sorry, I didn't see you there. Sweet dreams. Shoot. Candles. Can't have a birthday without a wish? I recommend the milk. Takes care of the booze. Then, no, thanks. I must have left one in. Must have. - I'm not wearing pants? - Oh, sorry. This night has brought a lot of things to light, don't you think? Sorry. Um... you... you... you see things differently. I can tell. You see things that others don't. You get like that when you grow up alone. You have a lot of time to watch. Watch what? Others live. Had any joy they feel, that freedom. That freedom of being carefree. I used to envy them. I wanna be them. Pretend to be them. But I knew deep down to be really like them, that would come with a price. Who would have thought you and I would be so alike? Right? Clare? You and I are nothing alike. Sweet dreams. Core? Big boys don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry... Where's the cake? You can't have a birthday without a wish. Not that there's much point. We all know what you'd wish for. And what's that? To be like me. All boys want to be like their fathers. And most do. Most boys turn into men... but not you. You're too soft. No wonder she'll never love you. No one will. You got it all wrong, Dad. No one really wants to be like their father. Because we know deep down... they're losers. We just don't have the heart to break it to them. We know how they look at us like their second chance. Their last hope. It's fucking pathetic. I never wanna be like you. Say it. Say it and I'll stop. They say all will fear two days. The day we get everything we have coming. The day our secrets are laid bare. It's her. No. No. What the fuck did you do? Me? For once in your life, just admit to it, take some fucking responsibility! - Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! - I didn't fucking do anything! What the fuck, man? You'll never do anything! You never do anything! You look at me like I disgust you but you're just fucking like me. Just like me. You're so scared of being like him, man. - Like who? - You deadbeat dad. You're scared of being a nobody. Not knowing the further you go to try to be somebody, the further you get from yourself. Hell, you're so... you're so far from who you are, man, you can't even see yourself no more. I may have ended his life, but I wasn't the one who stopped his heart. Ellie, please. Please. Josh? Josh was dead... long before me. He never wanted to live. No, he fucking lived to forget. Tell them. Tell them what he was like. Get the fuck over here! Tell them what he was like! How he only lived for those trips? Those fucking pills and nothing more! Some of us are just not meant for this world. Do you ever wonder what your life would have been like if you were someone else? If you had different parents... different friends... a different chance. What would you do if you could set your own fate? What would you do to those that stood in your way? She is the reason why we're all here. And why we soon won't be. Grab his feet. - Core? - Somebody. Will someone, please, pick up his goddamn feet! Let's just go, baby. No, no, we're not calling anyone... and we're not going anywhere. And if any of you try... I'll bring you all down with me. All of you. - Core. - "Core"? That's me. The fucking glue... the motherfucking spine that holds all of you together. Don't do this. We don't have to do this. We? There is no "we." I am as alone as all of you. We are all alone in this shitty fucking world. You're fucking crazy! I'm fucking dying! By the time I'm 40, I will be in the dark like all of you. If I can't change my fate... the least I can do is make it pay. Corey, please. "Please, please." I am so fucking over the demure act, Ellen. Hey, hey, leave her out of it. Just... just let her go. No. What the fuck is wrong with you, man? What has she ever done to you, man? Is that a fucking joke? What has she ever done to you? Huh? I don't know. But I'm not gonna wait to find out. Listen to me, okay? She's not who you think she is. She's just some girl. She's just some girl who's trying to be nice. Nobody is that nice. Corey, don't do something that you're gonna regret. Regret? The only thing that I regret... is falling in love with some trailer trash that always needs saving. Don't listen to him. All right? Look at him, he... - He's all fucked up. - Yeah. He's right. I am all fucked up. But you, my Ellie Bellie, you... are heartbroken beyond repair. Ellie, listen to me. Listen. What will you be without your scholarships, huh? Your academia, what will you become? You think about that? You wanna give up on all that? Risk all that? Just leave her alone. No, you... you stay out of it. Listen, Ellie, it's all... Listen, come on. It's all you've ever known. It may be all you'll ever be, but you'll never know. You'll never know what else you have coming if you don't make the right choice. You're unbelievable. You wanna go there? You wanna throw that stone? Look in the fucking mirror, Lincoln. No wonder we ended up here hanging out with you for so long. We should have known you'd bring us down to your level. Our level? El? You mean the level without heroes for fathers or saints for mothers? We don't have the perfect family with the perfect lawyer to bail us out whenever we fuck up! So, please, just give us a fucking break! Oh, my God! You know, I may have more than you have. But seeing as it's my birthday and this isn't exactly the first time my, uh, perfect family have missed it... I don't have as much as you think. But what I do have, what I've been gifted with on this special day... is the realization that the one person... who truly knew me and managed to see me... really see me... is lying face down in his own fucking blood... because of me. And all of you. We just wanted to see the real you. That's all we ever wanted. No. You wanted retribution. Clare? Clare? No. Don't. She's not like us. She's not supposed to be here. No! Hey. Hey. Clare? Clare? Clare? No! She's not supposed to be here. Why? Why'd you do it? Why do you always fucking do it? - What's your fucking problem? - You are the problem! You made it all of our problem. Nothing is ever enough for you. You... you... you always have to try every fucking flavor because... 'cause you can't decide what you want 'cause... 'cause you don't know what you want. Nothing is ever good enough for Ray. Nothing ever satisfies Ray. Core? You will never be enough for him. But you know what? I don't give a shit anymore. You... you two deserve each other. Always... always needing to be saved. Looking to be redeemed from your fucked up selves. - Corey? - There is no redemption. Not for you... for any of us. No! No! No! No! No! Why? Why? What are you doing? What are you doing? It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. No, no, no, no, don't... Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. It's okay. It's okay. Ray, look at me. Stay with me. Stay with me. Oh, my God. - No. - Clare. It's gonna be okay. El? El? Clare? You can't run from who you are. - Ellen? - Who you really are. Core? Don't fucking "Core" me, Clare. You're only scared of who you are because you hate who you think you are. Become your destiny. We make a pact. Today is a day we never forget. Today's all our birthdays. First day of the rest of our lives. When you're not confined by who you are, what's expected of you, when you can accept that you may very well not even exist, when you understand that none of that matters, when you know you don't matter, everything you do from then on becomes nothing but true. And it is then and only then that you'll see that destiny that you were so afraid of reveal itself to you in its entirety. So, what do you see? And as you watch as the world gets razed, as your own self gets erased, making way for a new tomorrow, clearing the way for what could, what should be... you smile.
