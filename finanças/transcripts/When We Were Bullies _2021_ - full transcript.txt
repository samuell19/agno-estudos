If I would have blinked, I wouldn't be telling you this story. Fast-forward two years. I'm still working on that film, and I'm looking for someone to do voice-over because I really don't like the sound of my own voice. At the time, I was teaching a film class. The students were showing their final films, and I was taken by the voice in one particular film. RICHARD: This film is about a cat. The cat fell. JAY: The narrator's name was Richard. He lived nearby in Berkeley, so we met at his house. As he looked over my script, he took notice of the following line. "He was raised on concrete, boxball, stickball, punchball, slap ball." Richard then turned to me and asked... "Are you from New York?" And you said, "Yeah." And we did the New York thing. "Where are you from?" "Brooklyn." "Where are you from?" "What part of Brooklyn?" "Sheepshead Bay." "Really? Wow." Uh... "Where'd you go to school?" You said, uh... something. But then I said, "Where did you go to elementary school?" Which was an odd question in many ways. But you said P.S. 194, and I just could feel the electricity, like, because I went there. And... (INHALES) ...then I said, "How old are you?" And you told me. And we were the same age. And I just said, "Whoa." Wait, what's your name again?" (LAUGHS) And you said, "Jay Rosenblatt." And I'm... (INHALES) "Who was your fifth grade teacher?" And you said, "Mrs. Bromberg," and it was, like, stunning. Because we had the same class. I remembered you. And I was trembling. And then you-- I don't know what-- Your reaction was pretty similar. We were both kinda like that. And then you said something... You said, "Turn the page." (CHUCKLES) And I turned the page of the script, and the first line was "In fifth grade..." -♪ (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS) ♪ -And it was like we had-- What? And it was like this whole flood of memory of things that I hadn't even thought about for decades. -Decades were there on the page. -JAY: Mm-hmm. And then what-- It was just... stunning to think that somebody else was writing something about something that I was part of in 1965, 3,000 miles away. And here we are and... feet apart from each other. JAY: Richard then honed in on that exact same moment that triggered the idea for the film. (PAPER RUSTLES) That time we bullied this other Richard. -Richard (BLEEP). -(MUFFLED INDISTINCT CHATTER) I mean, he could have written the words he was reading. (CHILDREN CHEER, CLAMOR) JAY: For me, the memory was vague. All I knew for sure is that it happened. And I participated. Oh, yeah, one last thing. We got caught. -(GLASS SHATTERING) -(CHILDREN CHEERING) JAY: Richard remembered details I had completely forgotten, or maybe I just blocked. Like how Mrs. Bromberg would insist that we were totally silent and sit at attention with our hands clasped before she would let us go home. But on this particular day, it was different. Mrs. Bromberg ran a tight ship. And she wasn't gonna put up with nonsense. And I-- You know, so when she says, "No one's leaving. I want it absolutely silent. And I will decide when you leave." (CHUCKLES) And we all just kinda go, "Mm." And it's taking a long time. You know, usually it lasts about a minute. You know, as a teacher myself, I know, you just... you wanna make a minute, and then you go. It's going on and on and on. And finally she says, "You can go. You would've left earlier, but Richard was talking." And I was outraged. I wasn't talking. And then, I realized people thought it was me and I was gonna get shit for it. I didn't want people being mad at me. So, we pack up our stuff, and it occurs to me that... it must have been the other Richard in the class, who we called Dick. Uh... that was his name that he was assigned in fourth grade, when there were four Richards in the same class, in Mrs. Weidman's class. There was Richard, I was Richie, there was a Rich, and then this other guy got Dick. And, you know, in the hierarchy of fourth and fifth grade, that's not a good thing. Yeah. So, as we're packing up our stuff, I started-- I passed along to Michael Sorrel, who was right in front of me, -I said, "It was Dick." -(CHILDREN WHISPERING) RICHARD: "Get Dick. Pass it down." -And it started getting passed down. -(CHILDREN WHISPERING) All the way down the line as we were walking down. And everybody heard it. And as we get out of the building, we s-- he s-- He must've heard it as well, because he starts running. But we all, as a mass, kept on running down the stairs and surrounded him and jumped on him. I jumped on him, and Michael Sorrel jumped on him, that's what I remember the most. Girls were jumping on him. It was, like, out of control. But we were all angry at him. JAY: Now, let's pick up where we left off. At the locked gate of P.S. 194. -God. -♪ (WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYS) ♪ -I don't like this, Richard. -(RICHARD CHUCKLES) I don't know where to put my foot. RICHARD: Uh, if you can get that foot down... and then just your other foot over. Then if you can move your hands to the fence at some point. -(JAY GRUNTS) -RICHARD: Don't come down fast.

And I remember being on my knees, somehow, and then seeing, looking back-- We're here, so perhaps I was punching him, perhaps just spitting on him, just perhaps yelling, I don't remember the specifics of what I did. But I do know Michael Sorrel, another student, was next to me because everybody stops, and we look up, and we see coming down the stairs... Mrs. Bromberg and Dr. Pinkus, the principal. Everybody gets up as one and starts running and running. And then I remember the next day, coming in, and Mrs. Bromberg sent... Dick out for an errand, and then just turned to the class and just said, "You are animals," and really gave us a going-to, yeah. -JAY: Wow. -So, it's just-- So, you know, from my perspective, it was like... I was trying to keep... me from getting the wrath of the class, and pinned it on him. (CHILDREN CLAMORING) JAY: This experience had clearly affected us both.
