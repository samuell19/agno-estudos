Breaking news: Self defense force called into action the order is to suppress the riots. Does the rioting have a political motive? Is it some sort of cult? It's currently under investigation, so I reserve any specific comment. Executive producers: Keijiro hara takashi shiozuki producer: Masahiro mikami the males in this symptomatic state show an abnormally high level of testosterone. Testosterone is found in male hormones and has a close correlation to the primal killer instinct... And also to a hyper sexual drive. Line producer: Masaru ikeda script: Naoyuki tomomatsu jiro ishikawa all men are savage animals. Rape is their natural instinct, so kill them all or more women will die. Do you want them to take over the world? Camera & lighting: Takehiko tamiya recording: Ryota tamiya are they alive or dead? That's still to be determined. Assistant director: Jiro ishikawa art: Ryo Chris kaibara did you shoot it? Two in the head, three in the heart. Action advisor: Shigeki hayase asami special make up: Keisuke kondo however, they still attacked us with their pants down and hard on's... He was showing me his erection, so I aimed my gun at him and... Hair & make up: Yuriko eda still photo: Takuya Takahashi they're moving but show no biological functions, it's medically impossible. They are clinically dead. Cg composition: Shota kawamura miniature creation: Hiroshi kangae it could be caused by an unknown virus. The women raped by such individuals all die. Editing: Emi nishimura making of featurette: Norman england if they ejaculate inside you, it's toxic enough to kill the victim! Assistant directors: Michihira yamaguchi shota kawamura firearms consultants: Yoshitoku kondo nobuyuki yamazaki where did you aim? I aimed at it. What do you mean by it? It's dick. Creature making cooperation: Taiga ishino assistant special make up: Daiki obata is this a rare disease or bio terrorism? I don't know. The only solution is to shoot them in the dick and cut off their balls! Director: Naoyuki tomomatsu You okay? What's wrong? I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die! No, you're not. But, they said on TV that you'll die if you're raped. Don't trust what they say on TV. But. He only stuck the tip in, right? Did he ejaculate inside you? Yeah, but, but... Let's clean the blood. Were you a virgin? It sucks that your first time had to be like that. I'm sorry. Rats, just some chicks. We don't have to kill them, right? But I overheard that she was raped. Cool! Don't! You're gonna die anyway... In a few days, the poison will pass into her system and she'll start suffering. It's better you kill her sooner than later. Then let me shoot her. I'm just getting good at it. Stop it! Do you both wanna die!? Put the gun down. Let me go! Just shoot this bitch! Quiet! Hey hey, you're hurting me, ouch! Put your gun down now. They never ejaculated inside, just the tip of it touched me. Suit yourself. What's your name. Nozomi. I'm kanae. Tamae, here. Momoko. Hey, looks yummy! I was super starving. We'll trade food for the gun. What!? That's insane. That's fine. We got plenty of guns and we gotta eat. Here. We found those in the abandoned Jeep nearby. And there's more. I'm not surprised to see those. So, how is it outside now? Not much progress, toxic men are everywhere. Toxic men? That's what they call them on TV. Due to the increase of co2 in recent years, we're facing a crisis situation for all humans. Is that directly related to the toxic men syndrome? Special emergency broadcast!! Nation-wide gang rape phenomena toxic man syndrome analysis!! Add to that, pollution in the air, water and food sources. Also, genetically modified foods may contribute to the cause. Evolutionary biologist: Flesh goto environmental consultant: Hiroshi Yamada we can offer a few theories here. A hole in the ozone may have had some effect on men's penises. It's not just ultra Violet but there could be many harmful types of radiation from space. So, this sort of radiation exposure could make humans go crazy. Feminist: Narumi yoshikawa you! What have you been babbling about!? A theory is just theory! Right now, we're dealing with an unexplained phenomenon... Medical doctor: Noriko tameike ...But we must make an analysis based on all possible theories... Let me comment since evolutionary study is my specialty. Everybody's fussing about environmental destruction... But I see that as just a part of human's change and evolution. That's absurd. Due to global warming, polar bears are on the verge of extinction. How many kinds of species have become extinct because of us? Who cares about polar bears? It's only natural that all species are in danger of extinction anyway. How about the spread of deforestation? If it gets worse, more species will become extinct. 33% of the land is facing deforestation. We must stop deforestation immediately. It's arrogant human egoism that is destroying nature! Hold it right there! Everybody's so protective about green things... But plants started the ecological destruction in the first place. 32 billion years ago, the first photosynthesis was caused by some bacteria. The plants started exhaling oxygen as exhaust fumes and blessed us with prosperity since. It changed the global environment drastically. That caused the extinction of other kinds of creatures from the planet. It was a bacteria, so no fossil remains were left. There must have been as many kinds of bacteria as existing species now. Still, species have survived. Species evolved and survived by adapting to breathe oxygen. We are the descendants of such species. There are always ways to keep evolving under any environmental conditions! Enough of this eco bullshit! Huh! This green obsession is our instinct to survive and destroy all the other species. I don't mind paying a little respect, though... So stupid! So stupid! Nobody wants to see such a thing. Get up and clean up already, will ya? I'm sorry, I'll clean up. Why is she working full time? I'm temp staff but way better than her. I'm sorry, I'll clean up right away. University hospital It's okay, don't get up. But I must go to work. No, you better rest here for today. But, I'm clumsy at work, so I try not to miss any work hours. Oh, if you must, I'll ask the doctor. Thank you very much. I won't ask you what happened, but try not to hurt yourself. Yes. You are not the only one who's fighting with a broken heart. I'm still grieving... Let's fight together! Yes. I'm sorry. I can't leave you alone. If you ever feel like hurting yourself again, let me know. Can you promise me? Yes. Well... You're not fired, we don't want an unfair discharge lawsuit. You're a full time employee and have a perfect attendance record. It's just that... Cutting your wrist in the company kitchen is not an acceptable act. I assume you don't want any conflict with co-workers, either. So, why don't you resign by your own will? Um... yes, sir, understood. Sir? No, please stop! That's too big for me! All men are animals and rape is their natural instinct. If we don't kill them, they will kill us. Are you fine with being ruled by men? Doctor, what are you doing!? You gotta shoot them in the balls or cut off their dicks! You're dead if he comes inside of you. Understand what I am saying? Male toxins will kill all women! The news reports that this toxic man syndrome is not only happening in Japan... But has allegedly spread worldwide. - Momoko! - Men becoming rape zombies!? I'm only a part timer! Do I get medical insurance!? Please, help! Momoko, spread your legs! Hurry! Are you alright? It's still in there! Let's go! I can't take it anymore! Feels good! I feel so lucky, do me more! I'm coming, I'm coming! We gotta help them. It's too late, we have to get out of here. Will you, take over the lookout? Oh, okay. Oh, momoko. Sorry. No, I didn't mean to scare you. Yeah, it seems nobody comes around here. Must be a blind spot in the city, like a dead zone? Why don't you get some sleep? I'll cover your lookout shift. Um, okay. Then, goodnight. Well, I am... Momoko, have you ever done it with a woman? No, I haven't but don't worry. I did. In a public bathroom. When I was in high school, I was manager of the rugby club. One day, I was called into the locker room and... Look at her panties! I was gang raped and videotaped. They blackmailed me to not tell anyone. You want some more? Hey, it's my turn, man! That went on until graduation. Nozomi. Momoko. Does it still hurt? No, it feels good now. Let me. Your boobs are beautiful... And big! You're so pretty. No, I'm not. Yes, you are. Who are you? Well, if you ask me... What's going on? I don't care if you were fooling around, but isn't that too careless? Sorry. Momoko. Stop giggling you pervert! Ouch. Um, hey you, your clothes were ripped, right? Do you need a change of clothes? There are some in the back. Is it okay if I go get them for her? Don't do anything funny. Huh, didn't know there was such a room was in the back. You, how long have you been watching us? Don't insult me like that, this is my place. You guys are the intruders. Is that it? Don't you think this would fit momoko perfectly? Don't you have something more normal than that? Actually, I wanted to change my clothes! Well, this is a shrine we're in. Wow, momoko, it suits you so perfectly! Kanae is, okay I guess. What's that? Whoa, what's this, super cute! Uhh... Is this so bad? No, you look good... right? So, who the hell is he? It's so awful. I'm a priest in this shrine and you guys are trespassing! You are a guy! You never know when you might become a toxic man. I will never be one. Besides, I don't like them being called toxic man. A toxic man is supposed to mean otaku, a guy who's single and pure. Rape is a typical behavior of dokyun and male athletes! Dokyun? Those slaves of testosterone! Sex is nothing but barbarism in the first place. Are you one of those veggie boys? Or a stay at home boy perhaps? Whatever, you're just a creepy perv! I choose to be a virgin!! We proud chosen people don't need sex. Just enjoying moe satisfies my appetite well enough. I feel uncomfortable. Oh, momoko, that's exactly, moe. Maybe that is possible... What about it? Stay at home people didn't get any radiation. Also they are known for low testosterone, too. So, they won't become toxic men? Well, I heard that most rapists are not otaku. But they're still creepy. So. What's wrong with rape anyway? If you find a hot chick, you smack her and take her back to the cave and fuck her. That's the most primitive level of homo sapiens and how we reproduced ourselves. You! What's your stance on women's rights? There you go! Women's rights crap. You wanna hear it? Kiss my ass, women's rights! What did you just say? Listen, just like prostitution was the very first profession... And the very first law was the prohibition of rape. He's funny! It was the sorry angry losers whose women were raped who created the code of hammurabi. The fear of being eliminated by natural selection. That's the human instinctual fear. To avoid that, humans continued to progress. Rape was forbidden, no more smacking women. Instead, men started giving flowers to women. So it's only flowers that satisfy women, huh? Women started to control mating and breeding... Your son? None of your business. Women started judging men by their tributes. That created the need for currency. It was time for economics and math. Humans finally realized, there is no limit to greed and the desires of women! Men had no choice but to start invading other tribes to acquire more wealth to please women. Tribal violence is the origin of the act of war. The taking of prisoners as slaves led to class structure. Social inequality was born. Slaves and beggars are losers, so they couldn't get women. Royalty and favored classes kept women to themselves. In the peak of the ottoman empire, there were 1,000 women. Same thing in the ming dynasty and the edo period. Just a single man, an emperor or king, kept all those women to himself! What the hell!? There are only so many women you can acquire by force. Maybe 4 or 5 at a time. There are few guys who can't get their women. Due to civilization's laws against rape, 999 men suffered from not getting their women. We shouldn't have denied the primitive custom. We should have never guaranteed women's human rights! Civilization didn't make people happier. Forbidding rape only created more unhappy people. Smacking woman around and having lots sex is the right course for human sexuality. That's the one and only way of making love! Finally, humans have come to realize that principle. Rape'em, bang'em, stand up men, all of you out there! Rape all women and let them know your power! Take control and restore your dignity! This is our time to evolve. All you men out there, get your dicks up now! He was just so arrogant and annoying, so. Of course, he deserves that! Yes, this is totally an acceptable act of violence! Act of violence. Come to think of it, it's my very first act of violence. It feels pretty good actually! Are you okay?! Are you okay?! Let me go! Help! Don't touch me! Help! Somebody help! Please wait for a moment. Is it true that firearms have been distributed? Live: Tama river reservation munitions distribution has begun apply at your local city office yes, all male defense personnel have become toxic men... Live: Tama river reservation munitions distribution has begun apply at your local city office ...So there are excessive amounts of firearms. So, there are more than enough firearms then? Yes, apply at the city office and take a 2 hour course. Any woman can receive a firearm. So, any female is eligible? This is the time for women. You must protect yourself. Next. Miss Takahashi? Ready! Firel ready! Firel Ready! Firel Kanae. Can I take over the watch? Thanks. This picture. Yes, it's my son. My husband was the lowest scum. Domestic violence... I was always covered with bruises. I didn't care about myself, but he started hitting my son... So I had to. Just when toxic man syndrome was becoming an epidemic. I took advantage of that to cover up my murder. But, your husband would have become a toxic man sooner or later. Sooner or later? Well, I guess I deserve divine punishment. I only did it to protect my son... Hurry up, he'll be coming home soon... You're home early! Mom and dad are busy now, so go play outside, okay? Thank you for telling me. Oh, yummy! You better eat more. Momoko, you have to try this. This is good, too. Want me to feed ya? Oh, but didn't you say I was creepy? I have a different opinion now. Here, open wide. Thank you, thank you. Otaku are the only decent men alive, right? All other men seem to be toxic zombies now. Again, toxic men are like me, those zombies are dokyun. I don't care which is which. After all, they're just rapist monsters. Here, open wide again. Hey, otaku like high school girls, too, right? How about me? Are you a circle crusher, by any chance? What's that? Momoko, are you okay? Please wait a moment. We will start broadcasting again when we receive news updates. There is no programming at the moment. The end of humanity? Want some water? Aren't you thirsty? You are sweating a lot, let me wipe you. Momoko, is this? Is she okay? What is this? Pregnant? No way! What are you doing? Don't you get it, it's a monster's baby! She was raped only yesterday! Anything is possible with those freaks! She said he didn't come inside of her! He could have been a minute man! No. He didn't rape her. I won't let you kill her! Then, do you wanna die first? Don't aim that gun at her! Same to you! I won't let anybody shoot momoko! We gotta kill her! No! It's, nozomi's baby. Nozomi and mine. Are you crazy? Lesbians can't make babies. Hey, momoko, did you receive the annunciation of the lord? You know like when the virgin Mary had Christ... An angel came to tell her that. That's for christians, we're in the shinto shrine! Shinto accepts a multitude of gods, so either jehovah or Jesus, totally fine, they're accepted. I don't care about that. I will protect momoko no matter what! This is breaking news! Regarding the declaration of war issued by North Korea. There is a public announcement from the first female prime minister of Japan, hanako tsuchiya. Well, I am the very first female prime minister in Japan. Prime minister, hanako tsuchiya now that I am in charge... I won't let men do as they please anymore. Breaking story North Korea issued a declaration of war all male politicians are useless anyway. Breaking story North Korea issued a declaration of war all they cared about was keeping their mistresses. Compared to that, my night clubbing is nothing! Prime minister, any comment about the declaration of war? Yeah, right, regarding the global gang rape incidents... Lit is merely a result of the excessive amount of violent porn... And zombie imagery originated from Japan. Thus, we judged that Japan deserves sanction and declared war. I knew it, we should've banned all those sick videos long ago. Freedom of expression is major crap created by men! It's all because we gave them too much freedom to create sickening sex fantasies! Also, what's all this about making a big fuss over young chicks!? What makes a women attractive is not her youth! A women's true charm is revealed after age 50! Excuse me, prime minister. Will there be a possibility of using nuclear weapons? Yes, well... um. Oh, a satellite captured the image of a nuclear rocket... In North Korea being fueled, huh! What's the current status of the us interceptor missile? Having such a high level of testosterone, the us military system has already collapsed... Military forces have been re-organized with the remaining female soldiers. But they are occupied with domestic security enforcement... Well then, that's all for now! I am on my way to Hawaii by chartered government jet! Ee sea se on Ean - a ne ae a ay nest which means, taep'o-dong missile will be coming? Prime minister! Wait! Let go of Mel! Firel Hey, look! Isn't that a rocket? Is that by any chance... Holy smokes! I'm having a baby. Momoko! Open up, momoko! Move over, I'll blow her away. Stop it! Don't get in my way! No way! Is it night already?! Because of the bomb? Nuclear winter? So soon? This must be ama no iwato, the hiding of the sun goddess in the heavenly rock cave. Oh, don't you know about it? When the sun goddess hid in the heavenly rock cave... The entire world became shrouded in darkness. It is a myth... must have been created by someone who studied eclipses in ancient time but... God susanoo, an incestuous brother... Threw a dead horse at the bed of amaterasu, the sun goddess. Then, that caused a fight and amaterasu locked herself up in the heavenly rock cave. Amaterasu is the goddess of the sun, like Apollo of Greek mythology. The highest ranking goddess, like Zeus and Apollo, all in one, even greater than an emperor. What is that all about? Then, what did amaterasu do? It's a big pain not having the goddess of sun around, it's all dark, so... The goddess of dance, uzume, started stripping in front of the cave and... When amaterasu came closer, tajikaro broke the gate to open it. Then the sun came back to the world and everyone lived happily ever after. So, amaterasu was also into women. Then, how about you start stripping? I just don't get it. Why are we taking this otaku's baloney seriously? Anyway, we must kill momoko's baby. I won't let you do that. It's getting kind of stupid. Is it okay if I go? Go where? Not sure yet. I am gonna take him, too. Whoa, am I going with you? See ya, kill each other or whatever. Bye bye. Are you okay with that? Don't care. Momoko. It's raining. What good timing... Should have waited until it stopped. Will you untie me now? I can't keep walking like this. Maybe later. Is this the so called black rain? It's coming from a mushroom cloud, right? Well, it helps putting out the fires. We haven't seen any toxic men so far. I guess they all died by now? Taep'o-dong missile rocks. So, where are we going now? First, somewhere with a bed. Then, we have sex. What, I didn't know that! What's the problem? You're so lucky to have a cute school girl like me! I told you otaku don't need sex, moe is all we want! You just gotta give up being an otaku! Here, look. I am sure you have a sex drive. If otaku give up being otaku, it makes me just an ordinary man. I don't wanna be dokyun or an animal. Sex is good. If you give up being otaku, you can have lots of it. What? Are you mutating?! Time to lose my virginity! Isn't there any normal men alive? Help! Someone help! It's so gross! Stop it! Momoko! Momoko! Are you okay? Momoko! They are coming for us. Let me use this. Don't worry, stay here. You gotta protect momoko, right? Kanae. All men think about is sex! Women are not sex slaves for men! Momoko! Momoko, momoko, momoko! You gotta pay for ripping off women's clothes! You pigs all die! Baby's born!? Momoko! Where are you going? Hold on! Momoko! Momoko, we have to escape! Momoko! Why? Human beings were born from one single female mitochondria. We are all a descendant of that! That's evolution. Soon, there will be... No, it may be already born. The first of the new human species!
