Pay attention! Ah, yes sir. I'll pay more attention! Anyway, take this map to Kanemaru who is staying in Kumokjung now. Hand it over and bring me the promised money. What is this, sir? If Kanemaru wants this so bad, it must be something big. Watch that mouth of yours! If the word gets out anything about this map, bandits will be hounding all over it just like wolves going after blood. Keep quiet and don't screw up. Do you know Park Chang Yi? He's in on this, too?" Yes. You don't ask question but to give this map to Kanemaru. Then Chang Yi will see to the rest. Now, go. I turned the map over to Kanemaru. Your job is to get on the train. And steal the map back from Kanemaru, that's it. We get paid and the map back. Everyone's happy. Manchurian soldiers are escorting him. Be careful. Are you worried, sir? Of course not. I know what you're capable of. You're the best in all of Manchuria. Just Manchuria? Best in Manchuria means best on the continent. Forgive me, I'm not good with words. Here. Your train ticket to Gando. What the hell are you doing? Bandits don't need train tickets. Then? We'll stop it. Rice cakes! Candy! Rice cakes! Candy! Independence for Korea! Rice cakes! Candy! Rice cakes! Candy! Over here! Rice cakes! Nobody move! Freeze! (THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE WEIRD) Get up! All of you! Hurry up! Hurry up! Now! What's going on? Who are you? Can you speak Korean? Do you understand Korean! What? Don't know any Korean, at all? Bags! The bags! Hurry! Get'em down! Hey, you! Get that one down, too! Quickly! That big one! Hurry up! Now, that one! You! Is that yours? Hey! I said, is that yours? Wait! Do you know who this is? He's Sir Kanemaru, Chief of Japanese Imperial Bank. Kanemaru or kangaroo! Come here! Darn it, what's that? Get out! Get out! Go! Hurry up! Yes, sir! - Give me the bag! - No! Bitch! Is Chang Yi after the map? Come here! Come out! I'll kill you! Shaoling! No! Please! Let her go! Open up! Move! Does it hurt? Find the map! My rifle! Who the hell is that? Stop the train! Byung Choon? Yes, sir? Any guesses on what's going on there? No clue, huh? No, sir. I think… it's the fool up front who has the map. Man Gil! Hurry! There's Park Do Won, the bounty hunter, chasing behind. What a nuisance! Get rid of him! Yes, sir. Who was that? I have no idea! Isn't the guy on the bike a friend of yours? Yes, but not anymore. Did ya get anything? Sure did! What? I'll show you later. Let's go! Let's go. Get moving! What do you think it is? Well... Not sure. Where is it? Maybe Manchuria... But with the Russian writing, could be the Maritimes Province. Wait... Hey! It's a treasure map! A treasure map? Before Qing Dynasty's fall, they buried a great treasure somewhere in Manchuria. This is the map! No way! It was once on the Ghost Market then suddenly vanished! All the bandits came here looking for it. Go find out everything you can about that map. Gotcha. Leave the map. What? You don't trust me? It ain't that. Just leave it. Come on, man. It's dangerous to be carrying it around, fool. And… Get some cash for this. Whoa! This'll be worth a lot! Be careful. Someone might've trailed us here already. No way. They wouldn't dare! This is my turf! Just be careful! Okay, man! You little… What in the world is this? Russia… Border... Treasure… Absolutely no idea. Who's there? Hold on. What should we do? Who is it? It's me, Byung Choon. Byung Choon? Hey! You freak! Get out, you freak! Sorry! Sorry! Freeze! Get out! What happened? Tell me! Where's the map? Give it to me. Before I do... you must pay your dues. Ah, right. What do you think you're doing? I should've known. Fine. I'll give it to you. Just give me the map. Crazy bastard! You've got some nerve for someone who's hired to kill! Gone crazy over money? You worthless son of a bitch. I took you in when you were wandering around drunk. I saved your sorry life! I wanted to end this nicely, but you give me no choice. You may be the top killer in the land… But you can't dodge a bullet. A bastard who kisses the asses of traitors… I'll end your sorry life and… Funny, ain't it? People must know they'll all die someday. But they live as if they never will. Damn funny. Well, well... We found out, sir. It's the Ghost Market thugs and Park Do Won. Did they know I was after it? Yes, sir. But… Looks like Park Do Won was after you, sir. What's the Ghost Market? It's where thieves sell stolen goods. There was a gunfight last night. The fool who stole the map ran away to the Ghost Market. He'll probably sell it there. How many men can we round up? About a dozen, sir. Get the boys and go to the Ghost Market! Pack this up. Yes, sir. Granny? You sure do live long. You'll probably outlive me. What happened last night? Byung Choon came after me. He even said his name before shooting at me. Why? For the map? Probably. So did you find out? It's gotta be the Qing Dynasty treasure map. Not only the bandits, but the Japanese army's after it. Let me see it. There's gotta be somethin... Forget it, man! Hold on! I know this! This is the Russian Empire... Alexand... Sand? Desert? Alexander. What's that? - Give it back! - I can do this! Next word is... Buried. It says, Buried! Like a buried treasure? That's right! Then it says... 'Excavation'! Ex-vacation? What's that? It means dig up. Then... 'In large... volumes'? Then this all means, buried, dig up, in large volumes? Hold on! - Are you sellin' it? - Nope. You crazy? The Ghost Market thugs are after this. The word will get out quick. The chief here will probably give ya at least 1000 won. You idiot! This could be worth millions! Are you out of your mind? The reward on your head is 300 won. What? I'm only worth a piano? A used one at that. They think I'm just a petty thief? You, Mr. Train Robber, ARE a petty thief. Let's just sell it at the Ghost Market for 1000 won. No way! I'm gonna see if this is worth gold or shit. Granny! Granny! Know what this is? It's a treasure map! If we find the treasure, it's goodbye to this for us. We'll eat all we want and live in luxury! Where do you wanna go? America? Where else? France? En toi, c'est dah di dah. Je t'aime, moi non plus? What? Shit! They found out! Where are they? Out the window? Get out! Hurry! Get Granny! Granny! Granny! Damn bastards! Granny! It's not safe here. They went that way! Stay right here. Don't lose this and don't show it to anyone. Even if Man Gil asks, tell him you never saw the map. Watch Granny! The Ghost Market Gang is coming! Get out of the way! Damn it! Yoon Tae Goo, age 35, 300 won reward. What do you want? I can't speak Korean. You're Chinese, are ya? Okay! Stop! I knew it was you. You have the map, don't you? Who are you? Yes or no. Just answer the question. You're after the map, too? Damn bastards. I did, but not now. So there! Where is it? Use your brain, fool. I'm in this shit cuz of that map. You think I'd just go and tell ya? Just talking won't get through to ya. Wait! Okay! Okay! I got an offer for ya. I don't make deals with scoundrels. I'll tell you a big secret about that map. Know what it says? 'Treasure, Buried, Dig up, Large volumes'. What? That's what it says on it! It's a treasure map! So you and I can go there and find it! If there's a treasure, we split it 60-40. Me 60, you 40. How 'bout it? That's how you make a deal, pal! Did you say your name was Park Do Won? You must've heard of who I am. Of course you did. Then ever heard of the Ghost Market? My boys there will… Hey! Sorry. You crazy bastard! You evil son of a bitch! I never saw a Korean so nasty and mean! You can't do this to me, man! How old are ya! You little... Hey, Yoon Tae Goo. Don't even think about escaping. Give me some water. What did you catch this time? What's this? Get some sleep. You got a rough day ahead. Get me some water, girlie. It can talk? Water, please. - Song-yi! - Coming! Going somewhere? Escaping? No, of course not. I just gave it a tug and it just fell out. You folks shouldn't be so careless. Fine. Go back and sleep. It's raining. Boss? We saw Yoon Tae Goo, today. He's the one who took the map. Just as you wanted. Everyone's happy, huh? I get money. You get the map. And the original's safe where it is. If this map is wrong... or there's no treasure, then I'll find you. And make sure you get buried alive. That's no way to talk to an old pal. Just look at this place! And where's Man Gil? Granny! Granny? Granny! Granny! Granny! Damn! You scared me! You slept in here all this time? Damn fool! I told him to watch her… Where's the map, Granny? Where'd you put it? Where is it? No, not candy! The big map I gave you. The map! Just once. Once? Did someone take it? Who did you give it to? Let go! Man Gil? Did he take the map? I had to come and see you. Do I know you? You're alone? Yoon Tae Goo's a friend of yours, right? Where is he? And who might you be? I'm Park Chang Yi. Park Chang Yi? Help me! Tae Goo... Tae Goo... Hey! Going somewhere? Give me a knife. I have a message. A message for Tae Goo. So stay calm. And listen up. Tae Goo! Got it? This knife's blunt! New knife, now! Damn rain... Man Gil! Man Gil! Stay right here, okay? You! Run to the other side. So I can see where they're shooting from. Why should I be the one? Then who else? Should I run straight on? Or zigzag around and make 'em confused? Fine. I'll decide. Give me a gun, man! Hey! Give me my gun back! Do Won! Where're you going? Come back! Give me my gun! Where are you going? Come on! Give me my gun! Gun! Now! Do Won! Gun… Man Gil! Man Gil! Man Gil! Man Gil! Man Gil! Man Gil! Watch out. Get the horses! Are you Korean? Yes. Is Yoon Tae Goo in your gang? We don't mix with losers like him! When our gang gets here, you're all dead! Yoon Tae Goo. Park Chang Yi. So we meet, here. This is awesome but why's it so damn heavy? Where the hell is Man Gil, anyway? Got any more? Are they Chang Yi's boys? Damn, they're nasty. Why's it so quiet? Are they planning somethin'? Go, Boss! Run! The Ghost Market Gang is coming! Man Gil! Man Gil! Man Gil! Man Gil Man Gil! Tae Goo... Park Chang Yi came for you. Chang Yi? Why? You didn't lose the map, did you? How's the meal, boss? There's something I've been dying to know, sir. I heard you once had a duel with Yoon Tae Goo. Is it true? Then who won, sir? I heard different rumors. Some even say Tae Goo is the best. Get up. Sir? I'll show you who's the best. That's not what I meant... Get up or I'll blow your head off. Listen up. I'll show you who's the best. And who's the legend. I'll prove it once and for all. Don't die till then, and be sure to watch. Let me ask you somethin'. Just when I'm about to sleep? It just popped into head. Why are you so bent on catching Chang Yi? Ever heard of the Finger Chopper? The Finger Chopper? Chang Yi's the Finger Chopper? Yup. I heard he came to Manchuria but no one's ever seen him. It's Chang Yi, for sure. Someone in Wonsan once claimed he was the Finger Chopper. When Chang Yi heard about him... he found him and butchered him. Just cuz he claimed to be the Finger Chopper. He shot him and cut him up like a piece of meat. Along with five of his men. Even cut off his finger, too. If you weren't in the way, I could've gotten him. What's so funny? The rumors. You say he's the Finger Chopper, but that's not what I know. So you're after him cuz he's the Finger Chopper? Cuz he is bad. That's it? And for the money. You scare me more than him. If you have no country, you still gotta have money. Whatever, pal. You're the most cold-hearted Korean I ever met. You'll end up rich for sure. I'm going for Chang Yi, not the treasure. If this really is a treasure map, he's sure to follow you. Even if it's to hell. Hey, wait a minute. This map ain't his! He's after me cuz I stole a map he wanted first? It ain't right! Thieves got rules? You don't know, man. Even though we're thieves, we have rules, too. If someone's in the door before you first, you need to back off and that is the rule. Chang Yi's goin' against the rules! Pisses me off! Hey, wait! If he's still following us after getting beat at the market, that means this is a real treasure map! Yes! That's right! Keep following me, Park Chang Yi! What's so funny? I'm happy, man! I'll tell ya since we're in this together. If we find a big treasure there, whatever it may be, You know what I'll do with it? Wanna hear what my dream is? I'm going back home and buying me some land. I'll build a house, raise some cows, horses, and sheep. That's it? And some dogs and chickens, too. Anything else besides buying land and raising livestock? I never thought beyond that. Why buy land when your country's stolen? For folks like us, it's the same living under nobility or the Japs. Now, it's your turn. For what? If we find the treasure, what do you want? Wait, I shouldn't be chattin' away like this. Let's sleep. We got a big day ahead. How did you end up in Manchuria? I came to live a new life. Why Manchuria of all places? Did you steal in Korea, too? Don't ask, man. It's sad. Hey. Yoon Tae Goo. Everyone has the right to dream big but... Did you know? What? Hurry up. I gotta sleep. If you chase somethin' to get somethin' Somethin' else will come chasing you. Life is about chasing and being chased. There is no escape. Let me sleep, man. Stop making me think! This map... I don't believe in it. But if it's for real and someone asks what my dream is… I'd say... You asleep? Are we there yet? Beyond this hill is a plain. Then a small hill in the middle of the plain. Beyond that within a 30m radius should be the place. Go and check. Yes, sir. Hejun! Shengying! We finally made it! We're here! I see it! I see it! I see the ocean! The ocean? It's the ocean. The ocean? What the hell! Byung Choon. What happened? Damn that Man Gil! Food and drinks, please. Got a spare room? Yes, right down this way. Sir. This used to be called a stable house. Where people stay and rest for a few days with their horses. But now... What is this place? Don't worry, sir. Who are you? You don't know me, but I do know you well, sir. You robbed that train, didn't you? Don't get excited, sir. I'm Suh, a fighter for the independence of Korea. Crazy from too much opium? Everyone says he's working for independence, and now even opium deales are too? Let's discuss the details in the private room. What's going on? They're just the barmaids. Don't worry, sir. Embarrassed to say, but opium funds the movement. Our primary customers are Chinese, Russian, and Japanese. You must know how difficult the situation is in Korea. If you'll allow me... Anna. My staff. As you know, Japan took over Korea using Manchuria as their puppet. And now they're set on taking Gando. But Gando belonged to us! This land is rightfully ours. We owned out to here in the past. Whatever, Mr. Independence. My map's got nothing to do with that. So forget it. Not in the face, girl. Your map is the key to the future of Russia and Manchuria. If it succeeds, it'll have a huge impact on... Hey, you! What the heck are you talking about? You're not making any sense. Stop smoking! He's already giving me a headache! The future of Korea, rests on that map, sir. Japan is trying to take over the inland continent as we speak! More than ever. Your map will be a great help to Korea. So, I ask you... Who are we? What are we? If you hand over the map, you'll be greatly rewarded. I get it! Mr. Independence wants the map! You won't find anything even if you get there. Oh! Mr. Independence really wants the map, huh? Damn! He's so heavy. It's me. I got the map, so tell General Kuroda to get the money ready. Of course I caught him! I told you he'd come this way. It's the border. Wake up, mister. Please, wake up! Mister? Who are you? You a new girl? Where's that bastard? Here I am, you son of a bitch! Close your eyes, kids! Independence fighter my ass! He fell for it good! Out of the way, kids! I'll take the map. You can go to hell! What? You little… Close your eyes, kids! I've been in countless wars. But I've never seen such gruesome deaths. Damn Koreans. Perhaps he's a pervert? Did you find the map? No, sir. We lost it again. I heard about what happened at the Ghost Market. The thugs there are pretty rough. You say you have somethin' for me? I hear you're looking for the map. No... The one who has the map. Yoon... Tae... Goo. Capt. Ishihara! It's time to make a decision! Send in all the troops Mobilize all forces out there… both Japanese and Manchurian. Yes, sir. If you don't hurry, Tae Goo and Do Won will get there first. I don't know what your deal is with Tae Goo, But stay away from him. Never saw anyone come out alive against him. He'll survive no matter what. What if an independence fighter took the map? If that's the case, it could mean disaster for us. What the hell? Byung Choon? Mom… Mom… That way! Fire! It's the last resource for our nation's prosperous future. Capt. Ishihara! We must find that map! Byung Choon? What's going on? Isn't that the fool who has the map? I think so, sir. Blow the horn! Tell the others to get the fool on the scooter! Yes, sir. By the way, sir. What really is this map we're after? Yoon Tae Goo! Hey, Tae Goo! Stop! Or I'll shoot! Who do we go after, sir? He's the one with the map! The one up front! Get him! Yes, sir! All forces! Charge! Don't kill him! The map could be somewhere else! Tell the boys up front! Catch him alive! Blow the horn! Who the hell is that? Should we open fire, sir? Of course! Hurry! Wipe 'em all out! Yes, sir! Open fire! The Japanese army is here! Son of a bitch! What do we do now? Forget the map! Let's go! Idiots! Get him! Attack! Yoon Tae Goo! Retreat! Retreat! Stupid son of a bitch! Fight till the end! Son of a bitch! You scared me! Found it after all? Park Do Won! You made it! Where'd you go? I missed ya. This is the place. It's right here. What's this smell? The treasure's rotting? Dig! Ah, sure. But why am I the only one digging? We split it 60-40, so I dig first, is that it? You don't trust me, do you? Bingo. Not till I see it first. Think I could ever trust you? Think this is a joke? Go on. Dig. Put the gun away while you can. Then you think you can beat me? Are you trying to be funny? The reward on you shot up. Real high! Don't ruin my happy moment, pal! You dare escape my punches! Come here! Put'em up! You're on thin ice, man. What the hell is this? Is it a treasure house? Who was that? Park Chang Yi, that bastard! The sick bastards! What the hell is that? I knew it. There's no treasure here. Know what I thought about while coming out here? I lost everything. All thanks to you two. They died like dogs. Died in vain. Actually, no one dies in vain. Only those left behind feel empty. So I've decided… to fill the void… I'll play a game with you two. A way to get rid of both of you at once. A fun game. A game to decide who's the best. Where no one knows who will shoot whom. Where only one man survives. Right here, right now. I'll kill both of you. That'll never happen. I'll shoot you down first. We'll see about that. Tempted, aren't ya? Come out, Yoon Tae Goo! That's it? That's all? Killing both of us to fill your void in life? That's just stupid! You fool! Why the hell did you chase me out here? To find out who's the best! You be the best! How simple it is! I don't care! Tell people I lost. I don't give a damn! If that's your reason for living, mine's finding the treasure and getting out of here! We don't see eye to eye, man. Got that? So, see ya. Then how's this! Reason enough for ya? How's that for a start? The survivor takes it all. Looks good. But why drag me into this? Can't call it a real game without Park Do Won. Think you got the skills? We'll see about that. Reason enough for me. Tae Goo's in, too. Crazy bastards. It's cuz I can't stand you two. Split it between ya. I don't care! I'm outta here! Ciao! They're asking for it. Still got my finger? Finger Chopper! Hear this? Think it's funny? Remember? Wonsan, five years ago. Winter. I never forgot that day. Park Chang Yi. I left everything behind when I left Korea. So you forget it, too. How can I ever forget! There's no way out of this one. Guess you're stuck, Tae Goo. Or should I say, Finger Chopper. You're diggin' your graves. Don't regret this, boys. Let's roll. What… What the hell is that? (Dead) (Wanted: Yoon Tae Goo) (Reward 3500 won)
