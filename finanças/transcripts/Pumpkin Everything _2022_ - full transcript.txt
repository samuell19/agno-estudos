Instagram reel's local and national tv spots, all to celebrate the launch of "vampire rising." I am telling you, amy, this is your time. - From your lips- - to "the new york times" bestseller list? - Okay, now you're jinxing me. - Do you think publishing today calls just anyone, "the next stephen king?" - oh! - They do not. - Look, I don't mean to sound ungrateful, it's just you know how nerve wracking a new book release can be. - I do maybe one a week. - As an agent. It's different as a writer. This has been my dream since I was a kid, writing short stories in spiral notebooks. Now here I am, releasing the third book in my series. Is this really happening? - Pinch yourself. (amy squeals) and keep your calendar open. The tour doesn't start for a few days, but there is a solid chance for some tv appearances in the interim. Maybe even "hey, good day." - you're kidding? Would I joke about national publicity? Take the weekend to relax. (throat clears) you're gonna need it. - Oh, that much I have covered (chuckles). (soft music) (ringtone playing) mom? - First off, everyone's fine. - Okay, you only say that when something's wrong. - Good point. Your grandpa was driving to get a coffee and he went into the front of the store. - Okay, he does that all the time. - No, honey, he drove his truck right into the front of the store. We're at the hospital. - The hospital? Is grandpa okay? - He has a sprained wrist and he's a little shaken up. - Lillian, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm okay. - Okay, you and mom need to work on your definition of fine. Are you sure you're all right? - I'd like to say you should see the other guy, but the other guy is the coffee shop window. - (sighs) well, luckily your old truck can handle anything. - Well, not this time. - You totaled the truck? - I was waving to cindy bloomfield. I'm never doing that again. I'm just (groans)... - Well, I'm grateful that you're doin' okay. - Look, don't worry about me. - Hey- - grandpa, I... - We say goodbye in this family, dad. And she called me. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. (amy sighs) (playful music) - [maggie] get ready, autumnboro, foliage fest starts today. People come from far and wide to watch the changing of the leaves. It's gonna be a total gas, just like this next song. ♪ I got burnin' feet from hot asphalt ♪ ♪ a voice within me tells me don't go home ♪ ♪ so I run until my feet give out ♪ ♪ I jump a little higher to clear the ground ♪ ♪ sometimes I find a sweet shop ♪ ♪ and I start to drive streets ♪ ♪ that no longer are my own ♪ ♪ I keep drivin' your way home ♪ (music fades) - twice daily, with food. - Oh, I hate drugs. - Oh- - grandpa. - [lillian] amy! How'd you get here so fast? - Oh, sweetheart, I told you I was fine. - It's a good thing that your granddaughter's just as stubborn as you are. - Oh (chuckles). - Let's give tom a moment so we can get him checked out. - Oh, okay. - Of course. - We'll be right outside, dad. - [tom] hm. - Oh (sighs). (phone chimes) (gentle music) well, despite his protests I know he's glad you're here. - Grandpa hasn't changed a bit. - You mean that in a good way, right? - (sighs) I'm glad that he's doing better aside from the sprained wrist, but letting go of our past- - you're only here for a short visit, honey. Maybe you could just forget all that other stuff for a couple of days. - Forget that he withdrew his offer to pay for my college once I decided to write? Yeah, that's kind of a hard thing to bury. - I know, but you know how badly he wanted you to go to business school and one day takeover pumpkin everything. - If only had turned that wish into an ultimatum. - Not one of his finest moments. - [amy] no. (playful music) - okay. - But like you said, it's a short visit. No need to dig up the past. - Hm. - Okay, this wheelchair is just a formality. (phone chimes) - oh (sighs), they are staging my new listing. I have to take this. - Oh, go ahead, go ahead. I've got everything, mom. - Sorry. - All right, tom, you know the drill. No lifting, lots of rest, follow up visit in one week. - Aye, aye, captain. - And this time around, I want you to actually follow doctor's orders. - [tom] (grunts) yes. - This this time around? Huh. - Okay. Yeah, okay. - Oh, there she is. - Oh, bye. (phone beeps) oh! (phone chimes) oh, my client. "staging makes the house look cramped." one more call, and that's it. Why don't you get caught up one work and I'll take grandpa home? - Are you sure? - Of course. - Aw, dad, I am so sorry. (chuckles) okay, later gators. - This is great. Come on, we can go by the store. - Yeah, you know, why don't we visit pumpkin everything tomorrow? That way we can get some rest, yeah? - Come on, gimme a... I can show you all the changes I made. (nurse's throat clears) - right, car. You know what? Hold that thought (chuckles). - That's my granddaughter. - Oh no, the golden kettle closed? - Yeah, end of last summer. - Oh. - Patty, she lasted as long as she could before she had to retire. - And no one took it over? The hash browns alone were legendary. - Yeah, it's sad to see another family business go down. She always thought that son of hers, uh... - Jesse. - Jesse, yeah. - Yeah. - That he would take the reins, but (sighs)... - Well, I'd say jesse's plenty busy with his acting career. He's been in two huge films this year alone. - Flash in the pan. 10 years of showin' up and he's got no guarantee of future employment. Just... - So, the nurse at the hospital, is she a friend of yours? - Absolutely not. Why? - Oh, I thought it was just funny the way she worded that phrase telling you to, "listen this time around." - she probably had me mistaken for some other good lookin' old fella. - Oh, right (laughs). - While we're runnin' around maybe we could do a coupla errands for foliage fest. - I heard on the radio today's the first day of the festival. - Yeah. - Mm hm. - Can't finish off the week without a visit to pumpkin everything's night cap, ah! - Are you sure you're up for that? - It's not a lot of things. It's just a short list. - I mean, night cap. Maybe just this once another shop could host. - 30 year anniversary and you want it to go somewhere else? Over my dead body. - Mm, too soon. - What? - Nothing. (gentle music) (gasps) caramel apples! - Yeah, the only true way to kick off foliage fest. - (chuckles) how could I forget? - Come, on my treat. - Yeah? Thank you. - This is on me, tom. - Oh, well thank you. You have a great day. - You too. - Mm. Yes, so good (chuckles). Okay, so if I remember correctly, day two is apple harvest. - Followed by day three, a taste of autumnboro. - I love that one. - And day four, which is- - the scarecrow night. - Uh huh. - Yes. - So you can stick around for a couple days and dust off your scarecrow-building acumen? - Well, my promotional work from my book tour starts. - Wait, that's what's stopping you? - Well, the release of "vampire rising's" a pretty big deal. - "vampire rising?" - yeah, it's the third book in my series. The second book ended with dmitri's supposed final demise, but now he's back by reader demand. - Well, I'm sure some of your readers would understand if you were to cut a couple of dates, you know? - It's a national tour, so I was lucky I was able to get away at all. - Well, I guess I timed my little accident perfectly, didn't I? - Oh, no, I didn't mean it like that. It's just- - yeah. - Just something about this book feels different. It's like all my hard work's finally paying off. (tom scoffs) I even have a bit of a following, actually. - Hm. - But you know what? Let's make the most of the time we have, see how you're gettin' along. - I don't need anyone to, "see how I'm gettin' along." (tom grunting) (amy sighs) (gentle music) look, I don't have to tell you that pumpkin everything's always been my big dream. - [amy] well, it looks pretty. - The store always draws a pretty big crowd this time of year. We're gonna put up a lot more lights. You can't have too many lights. - Looks to me like you're head of schedule. I love the new setup. - Yeah. Couple of more bales of hay and a few really good lookin' scarecrows. - Did you do all this on your own? - Yeah. In the middle of a heatwave. I almost expired twice. (amy sighs) (chuckles) no, I didn't. No, no. I hardly raised a finger. Kit did most of the work. - Kit, as in kit parker? - Yeah. Remember how you two were almost inseparable? - I haven't seen him since high school. - Yeah, it's amazing how the years just melt away when you meet an old friend again. - Even if I was the one who caused the arctic freeze? - Well, why not give it a try? Here, have a look. (gentle music) - kit. - Amy. - Hi. (kit chuckles) - I didn't know you were bringin' company. (tom chuckles) oh, you haven't changed a bit. - And you look grown up. - I had to grow up sometime. - Oh, it looks like you're all stocked up for the season. - Yeah. Yeah. - Can't get through autumn without a visit to pumpkin everything. Kit's gotta set up for another record breaking month. - Well, to be fair all I did was order stuff. - Still modest as ever. - Yeah, but where are the pumpkin spice candles? They're a proprietary blend. People come from everywhere to buy those. - Yeah, I put 'em in the back. Look, I know you usually put 'em out front, but I was thinkin' since they sell out every year, why not put the new merchandise out front? - So people have to go through the store to get to them and see all the other merchandise. I like it. - [maggie] and now one final girl group track before I skedaddle. - What did I tell you about playing that oakwood dribble here, huh? (sighs) I'm gonna put on something much more appropriate. - Hm. - Tom's not the biggest fan of the local retirement home's radio station. - Hm, yeah. Let me guess, he says it's "too many old people." - "too many old people." - but he did agree to move the merchandise from its usual designated spot, so that's progress. - Are you saying tom's set in his ways? - Maybe just a little (chuckles). - Yeah. - But he is, he's lucky to have you around to help. - I'm the lucky one. Your grandpa gave me a shot on this job and everyone else had given up on me. (soft jazzy music) (kit chuckles) (amy chuckles) - now that, that's what pumpkin everything's supposed to sound like. - Okay, you've done your good deed for the day. I think it's time you go home. - Oh, you're just showin' me the gate? - I got a hunch the doctor's orders included rest. - Yes, and they are easy orders to follow with the store in capable hands. Let's go. - All right. - Come on. Thank you. - Try not to burn the place down, huh? (amy chuckles) - no promises. (jazzy music continues) (jazzy music continues) - [amy] the place hasn't changed a bit. - [tom] yeah, it looks good, doesn't it? - [amy] it does. - Yeah, kit helped with hangin' the plants and the decorations. - Sounds like kit's around a lot. - Yeah. Ever since that rough patch he went through- - yeah, how is he doing? - He was alone there for awhile. He... Yeah, he could have used a shoulder to lean on. Oh, I didn't mean it that way. I... You always brought out the best of him. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. Oh! Oh, this step is loose. - Yeah, that's kinda part and parcel with havin' an old house, you know? - Yeah, okay, but somebody could fall. - Not if you know it's there. - Ah, right. - Yeah. (gentle music) (door closes) (tom sighs) yeah. Obviously, I wasn't expecting to have an accident on my clean up the house day. - Didn't say a thing. - Yeah. - How 'bout some iced tea? - Yeah, I'll get it. - No, let me. - All right, extra lemon. - No sugar. I'm on it. - A little bit of sugar. (tom grunts) - (sighs) okay. (gentle music) oh. (amy sighs) (music continues) - can I help you find somethin'? - Oh, yeah, just a knife. - Should be one there in the sink. - Oh, okay. - Yeah, this was all stuff I was gonna get around to. - Happy to help while I'm here. - Look, I don't want you wasting your time here doing housework. - Normally I know you'd have this under control, but you do have a sprained wrist. (tom sighs) (playful music) (gentle music) oh, organizing your records? - Oh, one does not have to organize something that has been so meticulously cataloged. - (chuckles) touche. Remember our trips to boston? - Larry's records. - Mm hm. - And that humongous bookstore next door. - Oh, acres of books. - Yeah. - I loved it there. You used to say the books were payment for helping at pumpkin everything. I remember being so amazed that I could be rewarded for doing something I loved. - Yeah, pumpkin everything. You used to say that you wanted to work there forever. - You know what? Here, let me help you out with this laundry. - Oh, leave that now. - It's fine, really. Nothing at all. - Look, I just said leave it. Stop flittin' around. You're makin' me nervous. - Funny, what used to make you nervous was a mess of a... Fine. (tom groans) consider all household chores officially ignored. - [tom] thank you. (gentle music) (amy sighs) - may I (chuckles)? - Hey! - Hey. - Thought someone was stealin' a scarecrow. (amy chuckles) - grandpa's inside. I think he just laid down to take a nap, but he's probably still awake. - Oh no, I'm just comin' home. Tom didn't tell you? - No. - I'm stayin' in the guest house. - Well, it's nice to know that he has someone close by. Here, let me help you. - Well, thank you. - Yeah, of course. (gentle music) - all right, come on in. - Oh, wow. Looks like grandpa's fall decor took over your spot. - What do you mean? This is all mine. (amy chuckles) - really? Well, the last time I was in here, it was full of jazz memorabilia. - Yeah, it took a little negotiating. - [amy] yeah. - Hey, can I get ya an apple cider? - Oh, sure. You know, the more I see of grandpa and how he's doing, the more serendipitous your involvement in his life seems. - Well, the tom that you are seeing today is way more open to adapting his life than he was a year ago. - You've been at the shop that long? - Yeah, first three months wouldn't let me touch a thing. (amy chuckles) - thank you. So, how's he doing? - On his own you mean? - Yeah. - I think tom puts up a good front. Some days he has more energy than me. (amy chuckles) others it's a bit more of a struggle. - Mm. Yeah, part of me wants to take the good days as a sign that nothing's changed. - But we both know better. - Yeah. - I know, I worry about him too. - There has to be something I could do. - You already are, by being here. (amy sighs) but this change, tom has to make by himself. Join me on the porch? - Sure. (gentle music) you said earlier that my grandpa gave you a chance who no one else would. - See, I knew those words would come back to haunt me the minute I said 'em. - (laughs) well, that's me, predictable as ever. - You saw what I was like senior year, after my mom died. I landed at one bad decision after another. But even as I was destroying every relationship that I had in this town, your grandpa never gave up on me. - Maybe we should grab drinks tomorrow. You know, catch up before I head back? - How 'bout a coffee? I quit drinkin' years ago. - Oh, that's great. Congratulations. - Thanks. - Here we were, best friends and now I'm realizing how little I actually know about you. - Just remember the good stuff. I do when I read one of your books. - (laughs) oh, wow. I owe you big time for suffering through all my handwritten stories in school. - [kit] come on. See, I knew even back then you were gonna be a huge success. - Well, you were the only one back then. Yeah. Even after all this time, my grandpa still sees my writing as a hobby. - Yeah, 'cause he wants you here at the store. Tom has dreams, too. - Well, thank you for this. I should get going. - All right. Oh, careful on that last step. - Thanks, yeah, I noticed that earlier. - Yeah, I thought I had fixed that after tom's fall. Some issue with the foundation. - What fall? - When he was carrying groceries, he fell off the step. Your mom didn't tell you? - No (sighs). (no audio) (mellow music) - you were on a deadline with your book. I didn't wanna alarm you. - Well, next time please, alarm me. - If he had been more seriously hurt, I would've told you, but really honey, what could you have done? - I feel so powerless. - (chuckles) welcome to the club. I've made suggestions on retirement homes and gotten angry at his refusal to admit that he needs help. We even... We even went a couple of weeks without speaking. - You never told me that. - 'cause I felt like I failed. So, I had to make a choice, either bear my dad's resentment over my constant nagging, which isn't very fun by the way, or enjoy the time we have. (phone chimes) if that is luke from coffee culture again, so help me. Dad's barely out of the hospital and here's this guy already demanding money. - Hang on. This time it's me. - Oh! - My agent just booked a signing in boston at acres of books. - Acres of... Is that the shop that your grandpa always took you to? - Yeah. - Oh, honey. I'm so proud of you. What? - Well... - Okay, well, maybe I haven't always been on board with your pursuit of a writing career, but you've proven me wrong. - Well, I knew I made it once you invited me to speak at your book club. - Really? - Mm hm. - That was your sign? - Yep. - Not having a national bestseller? - Approval from you and grandpa outshines any of that. - Aw. - I guess one outta two's not bad. - Hey, your grandpa approves of you. - But then why is it less than one day home and I'm that same 18 year old who left autumnboro letting him down all over again? - Oh, honey, okay, you listen to me. What you need to do is focus on your book tour, okay? I can handle all this. - It's too much, even for you. (lillian chuckles) now that I think about it, it's too much for the both of us combined. (mischievous music) (amy chuckles) (lillian chuckles) (gentle music) - oh, hi. - Hey there. (vendor chattering) (shutter flashing) (amy chuckles) (music continues) - a stocking cap already? Are you gettin' weak on us? - Okay, first of all, it's cold. Second, I'm feeling the fall vibes. - Well, tom just stepped out. Should be back in a few. - Oh great, enough time for coffee. - Hot and ready. - Ah, the place looks great. Wow, the mailman must love you. - Those are online orders. Tom let me set up an ordering site jus in time for fall. - Online orders? He didn't even have an email address until last year. - I guess I have the magic touch. - Oh (chuckles)! - With everything except for that window display. - Yeah. - Will you give me a hand with this? - Oh, of course. Here. This is gonna come in handy. - Okay, just stay... - Grab that. - Yeah. - [amy] it's all about delicate touch. - Sure, I'm telling you- - oh, look at this. The dream team back together again. - You know it. Look at these, these are so cute! - Oh yeah, I got those at a garage sale. - What, are you kidding me? You walked right by the box. - It's true. (amy chuckles) he pointed them out to me. (all chuckling) look, I'll leave you two. - Oh, actually, I was here t o see if you'd join me for lunch? - If you're paying, yeah. - (inhales) impossible. - Have fun. (playful music) - so good seeing you and kit reconnecting. - All I did was help with the display. - Well, you know there was a time in this town when everyone thought that you two would end up together. - You mean the town of tom adams, population one? - Yeah (chuckles), yeah. So, where are we headed? - 52 maple crest drive. - What, my place? - Yeah. - I thought this one was on you. - It is on me. I found this amazing company. They grocery shop, they prep meals, they clean. Your house got a complete overhaul this morning. - I didn't give you permission to do that. - I knew you'd say no. - Then why did you do it? - I wanted you to see that there are other options out there. - I don't like strangers in my home. - They're professionals. Look, they even have an app. See? - An app? - Yeah. - I don't need an app. Maybe you need an app so you can feel better about not showin' up. (amy scoffs) (somber music) - wait, where are you going? - I'm gonna go make sure they're not robbin' me blind. (amy sighs) - seriously? (amy sighs) (gentle music) - good afternoon, tom. - Not today it isn't. (music continues) - grandpa? (tom groans) grandpa? At least let me drive you. You wanna walk three miles? (tom grunts) I won't say a word. (playful music) (tom grunts) (amy inhales) (music continues) - don't say a word. Oh! What's that smell? Did you have the place fumigated? - Would you look at the sheen on those floors? - Yeah, well here's hopin' I don't slip on 'em, huh? - Did you notice the windows? They're so clean it's like we're outside. Oh, and your records. It's exactly as you left them. - Now this, this is supposed to be right up front here. - Okay, so one photo is outta place, but was anything stolen, huh? Look, even your books are in order. (gasps) you own a copy of "night hero?" - vampire stories are not normally my cup of tea, but the fact that my granddaughter's a published author, that's usually a pretty good conversation starter. - Glad to know I'm worth few brag points. - (sighs) look, I know you brought the cleaners in here to support me, but you were out of line. I don't like strangers in my home. - Oh, the company pairs cleaners with their clients for the long term. - The answer's still no. - Okay, well, look, I definitely don't wanna be at odds with you, but you have to see that something has to change. - Change (chuckles)? Most of the changes I've experienced in my life are not wanted. - Yeah, I know. I really do understand. - No, there's no way you can. For you to understand what it's like to be at this stage of life, to understand what I'm going through right now, you're gonna have to get here, you know? And darlin', growin' old aint for the faint of heart. (amy sighs) (no audio) (mellow music) - (sighs) guess that's it. I'm leavin' tomorrow, what else can I do? - Oh, we have to do what your grandpa wants. Let him make the decisions. - Kit said the same. - What's it like being around kit again? - It's good, and weird. Mostly 'cause we haven't discussed how I left. - Oh, honey, you were both so young. Kit just lost his mom that year. He pretty much pushed you away. - Yeah, but it's the time he needed me the most, instead I just ghosted him. - Hey, hey, that was understandable. Your grandpa had just rejected your future career plans. - No, I felt like everyone was against me at that point. - Aw. - Doesn't mean I couldn't have told kit goodbye. - Let's go face the music. - [amy] oh. (gentle music) - all the way? - Yeah. - Wow. - It just got 1,000% harder to be laissez-faire about grandpa's decisions. - Did it ever. You know what else is hard? Craving a pumpkin latte from the very place that's hounding you nonstop to cover these damages. - Yeah, I kinda see their point. Maybe we could have just one pumpkin latte to know what're boycotting of course. (playful music) there you go. - Thank you, honey. It's on me. Two large pumpkin lattes, and let me see luke while you're at it. - Luke's the owner? - Whichever luke is threatening to sue an octogenarian. - Yes, luke, the owner, please. Aren't you the one who always says you can catch more flies with honey? - Yes, but it'll be such a release to let this guy have it. - How can I help you ladies? - Well, for starters you can... (soft music) hello. - I apologize for my appearance, I was in back helping with the donuts. - How refreshing to see an owner who's so hands on. - Were you waiting for the apple cider donuts? They're almost ready. - Yes. No, I... Forgive me, luke. I... (lillian gasps) where are my manners? Hello, I'm lillian. - Oh. - Your shop is beautiful. - Oh, thank you. Well, except for the (chuckles)... (lillian laughs) can I offer you some samples? - You certainly can (laughs). (ringtone playing) - we have got a whole bunch of things to choose from. - Hello? (luke chattering faintly) - are you sitting down? - No, I'm waiting for a coffee. - Okay, fine, stand, but don't say I did not warn you. Guess who just booked a spot to talk all about her new novel on "hey, good day?" - oh, wow, we did it, carla. - This is all you. The producer read "vampire rising" in one sitting. - (sighs) I needed some good news. When? - Early Tuesday, so we'll book your flight to new york for tomorrow. - Tomorrow? Oh, I'm still in autumnboro. - So, hop in a car and get back to philly. Now, I have a studio booked for tomorrow to shoot the promo for the show- - oh, this is happening so fast. - In all the excitement I totally spaced on the meeting. Call me when you're back. Bye. - Wait, carla! (line beeps) (amy sighs) - [barista] two large pumpkin lattes. - Oh great, thank you. You know what? Actually, I will take one more pumpkin latte for the lady over there when she's done with her discussion. (lillian giggling) I'll just take these, thank you. Bye, mom. - Tootles (laughs). (luke laughs) - let me get that for ya. Oh, you work out I see. (jazzy music playing) (amy sighs) - hey, there. Pumpkin spice latte? - Thanks. - We were supposed to grab that coffee later today, but I just got word that I need to head back to philadelphia sooner than expected, so... - You improvised? - Yeah, yeah, what you and I did best, and we kept each other so entertained, like creating our own mysteries and- - hiding and then finding the clues later. (amy chuckles) do you remember the puppet shows? - How could I forget? I swear, putting those on is what inspired me to write. - Yeah, but then I had all these lines to memorize. - [amy and kit] no cue cards. (amy laughs) I snuck a few in. - (sighs) we were best friends, kit, and I let that go. I should have been there for you after your mom had her heart attack and everything that you went through, but instead I ran. - I never saw it that way. You had to leave to pursue your writing. - No, I was young and selfish and I associated everything in this town with the burden of expectation. - Even me? - Watching you grieve, seeing you struggle, it gutted me to know that there was nothing I could do to make you better. - And you thought if you stayed, those feelings would settle into you? - I regret not showing up for you, so much so that I wasn't sure that I'd ever be able to face you again. - Amy, I understand. - How can you? - It was a long time ago. We're older now, and I'd like to think that we've learned from what life has handed us. But one thing was always true. Yes, I missed you, but I never expected you to fix me. - I just wish I could have done, I don't know, something. - All right, let's say you stayed in autumnboro. (amy sighs) your sense of obligation, as great of a trait as that is, it would've had you running pumpkin everything. And we forget your writing'd be in the backseat, it'd be out in the ditch somewhere. - I should have known that you of all people would understand. - You're not as complicated as you think you are. (amy chuckles) - any chance we can be friends again? - Hm, that would require more lattes, a few more visits. - Fair enough. Hug to seal the deal? - How can I say no? (amy chuckles) come here. (gentle music) (music continues) hey, safe drive to philly. - Thanks. (music continues) (music continues) (engine starting) (amy sighs) - hey, sorry to keep you waiting. What can I do for ya? (singer vocalizing on radio) - [maggie] you're listening to oakwood fm, radio by seniors for everyone. - Everyone but grandpa. ♪ oo, oo ♪ ♪ yeah ♪ ♪ I love to wake up in the morning ♪ ♪ but keep dreaming without warning ♪ ♪ the day is gone ♪ ♪ oo, oo, oo, oo, oo ♪ ♪ and sometimes I take a walk ♪ ♪ but I forget about ♪ top of the morning. - You know, I'd feel a whole lot better about it if you were to tell me you weren't leavin'. - I'm not.

We're here for an opportunity. - What do you mean an opportunity? - Let's have a great day at oakwood, people. Get out and look at those leaves. ♪ ain't got no shoes ♪ ♪ that car sold and a car ♪ ♪ ain't got no man I found in a bar ♪ hey, you must be amy, and tom? Rock on. I'm maggie. - Thanks for letting us visit on such short notice. When I heard you might have an open dj spot, I knew just the guy. In fact, both of us are big fans of your girl group afternoon. - You host girl group afternoon? - I only agreed to it on the condition that they let me do classic rock every Friday. - Well, grandpa has a playlist for every occasion. - Well, let's see what you got. - I'm a bit of a jazz aficionado. I have some ellington and some coltrane and davis, and a smattering of charlie parker mixed in. - Sounds like a pretty sweet collection. - I never graduated past disk, you know? It looks like a pretty highfalutin setup you've got there. - Oh, well, you know, some of our younger newbies are all about the mp3s. - Yeah. - But if you ask me, nothin' beats that warm crackle of needle on vinyl. You know? - Couldn't agree more. - (chuckles) you're gonna fit in just fine. We can work on a couple broadcasts together, get your feet wet. - That sounds great. - Then once you're all unpacked and settled, I'll put you on the schedule. - Unpacked, settled? - Didn't amy tell you? Dj spots are for residents only. (tom groans) - thank you. Sorry. ♪ oo, you should know ♪ ♪ the better things in life that are free ♪ - oh, come on! - No, no, absolutely not. - Nothing else has to change. You can come and go as you please. - No, no. - Just stop and look around. There's a post office, a coffee shop. There's even a little market. - I have all of those amenities where I am now. - But do you have a community pool, or a neon lit bowling alley? I mean, I wanna live here. - So these are carrots you're dangling in front of me, huh? Like that dj job? - All I want you to see is that not everything is an absolute. You can be a part of this and still live your everyday life. - These amenities come at a hefty price. - I might have checked the value of your home. - Well, here's a surprise. I visited oakwood last spring. - You did? - And I got my house appraised, and with even selling the home that I've been in all my life, I can't afford this. It's unsustainable. - You could always sell the store. Selling pumpkin everything would give you more than enough to live comfortably. - So, you want me to just walk away from something I put my whole life into? - Grandpa, I know that you wanna make this change on your own terms, but you can't wait for this perfect moment that might not happen. - Wow. - At some point you will have to let the store go. - Fool that I am, huh? Here I thought somebody was gonna step in and grab the reins and take it home for me. I guess not. (somber music) (amy sighs) - all right, you're all set. Thanks for stoppin' by. Didn't we say goodbye yesterday? I mean, I'm glad you're still here. - So was I for a moment there. - I think now's a good time for me to take my lunch. - You know what, kit? What would you say if I told you that tom here has an offer to be a regular dj on oakwood radio? - I would say I'd listen every day. - Right? - And kit, what would you say if I was to tell you that she thinks she could wave her magic wand and just simplify my life? - Only because you make it more difficult than it needs to be. - Uh huh. (playful music) - (exhales) I am starving. (ringtone playing) (amy exclaims) - hello? - [carla] tell me you're back in philly. - Not yet, but I will be soon. - Okay, is that a carla molina 10 minutes ago soon or an amy fox, "I need one more week on the manuscript?" before you answer, keep in mind that I have stylist, a cameraman, and a producer all awaiting your return. - Somewhere in the middle. - Is that what you want me to tell "hey, good day?" - of course not. - Real talk, amy. I cannot promote a book without the actual author. - Yeah. You know what, let me handle this. (phone beeps) (bright music) kit? Can you show me all your best sellers? - Yes. - Great. (tom groans) - there's a best seller. - Great. - Mm hm. (amy inhales) - this. - Oh. - Yeah. - What about these? - Oh, yeah. - Yeah? Cute. (chuckles) okay, ready? (bright music) ready? (phone chimes) hi, this is amy fox counting down the days until the release of "vampire rising," the third book in my dimitri north series. While we wait to discover the fate of our favorite vampire, I have been spending time in my hometown of autumnboro at my grandfather's shop. As you can tell, fall is more than just a time of year here at pumpkin everything. It's a way of life, savoring the first chill in the air to the dusk of an early night fall. In fact, my grandfather's love for fall and all the magic it brings is what inspired dmitri's journey. So, be sure to check out "vampire rising" October 15th, available online, and at your favorite bookstore. Did you get it (laughs)? - Yeah. - Thank you (laughs). Great. "how's this for starters?" (text message whooshing) hm, excellent camerawork. - Well, thank you. - That was amazing the way you just made that up on the run there. Just... (gentle music) - well, requirements of the job. - You know, I never really considered how your writing could create so much pressure on you, just... - Well, if you love what you do, it's worth all the pressure in the world. - Yeah. Yeah. - Well, while you're waiting for your agent to reply, do you wanna join me on a trip to fall hill farms? - You know what? I have not been to fall hill farms since the last time I helped prep for scarecrow night. - And you remember how much work it was? 'cause in 24 hours, we have all of autumnboro comin' here for the contest. (playful music) - you go ahead. I don't wanna re-injure my wrist. (amy chuckles) - fine, get the truck. (kit chuckles) (music continues) (no audio) (gentle music) mm, it's even better than I remember. - Now, if we really want a really good time, we should join these kids for a game of tag. - Oh, adulting's overrated. - Agreed. But I guess we should get at it. - Fine. - You know I had it. - Any idea how we get it out? - I don't know. - Hm. - And now, we race. - What? No. (kit laughs) (amy squeals) - first to the post wins. (tom laughs) (amy laughs) come on, what do you got, fox? - Ah! Kit! I- - you all right? - Ah! Yeah, I just (laughs)... - Hey! That's cheating! That's it (indistinct). (amy laughs) (kit laughs) whew! (phone chimes) (kids laughing) - "hey, good day" wants to do my interview at pumpkin everything. - Oh, because of the video? - Yeah. - Wow. Does that mean you're gonna be here for the scarecrow contest? - My tour starts the next morning. - Hm, sounds to me like someone's afraid to revive our tradition of who can stuff the most scarecrows? - (laughs) I'm actually more concerned about your ego suffering another blow. I mean, you did just lose a race. - Come on, leave the next morning. I'm sure there's a rooster or two around here you can borrow. (gentle music) - you ever felt like you needed to be at two places at once? - I think the solution to that is deciding where you wanna be. - In this moment, I wanna be here. (music continues) (amy sighs) my only wish is being home, grandpa would finally acknowledge my writing as a career. - Don't let tom's reaction take away from what you have accomplished. - It's like he's angry I succeeded. - Writing's a part of you he doesn't know how to relate to. But pumpkin everything, that's what you two always had in common. (bright music) all right, I'm gonna push you. - Yeah. - Ready? (amy laughs) - woo (laughs)! (music continues) - no, I know it's on at the same time as your favorite game show, but this is when the buyer's available. No, no, I cannot set your dvr remotely. Let me call you back. (throat clears) hi. - Hi. - Hello. - Allow me. - Oh, well, thank you. For someone who's defrauding my father, you certainly are well mannered. - (chuckles) that's all part of the negotiation process. - I see. - Listen, I hope you won't be offended, but I pre-ordered a few of my favorites, hunter's chicken with corn and sweet potatoes and butternut squash ravioli. - With brown butter and sage? - You're also a fan. - The best part of the season. (phone chimes) might as well enjoy a little dinner while I'm being swindled. - Swindled? Lillian, I own a coffee shop. Any idea how many lattes I have to sell to repair my building after the insurance claim? - Oh. I really didn't give that fair consideration. Since my dad's accident, I've been so wrapped up (phone chimes) in work that I haven't had time... Calling after texting. (phone ringing) - can't that wait? (phone ringing) - this is a really, really big listing. I'm lucky to have it. - I think they're the lucky ones. (ringing continues) - [waitress] here you go. - Oh, thank you. (ringing continues) - [waitress] enjoy. (call disconnects) (gentle music) (lillian's throat clears) - now, isn't this more enjoyable than some client phone call? - It actually is. (luke laughs) - oh. Mm. Mm (laughs). (luke laughs) I know, it's so good. - Huh? - (chuckles) okay. You have my undivided attention. How many lattes are we talking? (kids laughing) - I never examined the situation from his perspective. Anytime that my grandpa brought up my involvement in pumpkin everything, I just shut down. - Not unlike tom's response when he's talking about your writing. - You've become quite perceptive in your old age. - Old age, really? - Well, seriously, you see everyone's needs so clearly and understand what makes them tick. - I guess I'm makin' up for lost time. You know, I actually told myself that I stopped callin' it that, lost time. After my mom passed, you know, I wanted so bad just to bounce back, be okay, but I had to go through it and grieve in my own way. - I wish I was here for you. - You tried to be. I pushed you away. - Yeah, but I shouldn't have let you. - Yeah, but there's nothing you coulda done. I avoided anyone who reminded me of my mom. I drank to numb the pain and hurt a lot of people along the way. I mean, my own dad left town to get away from me. He wasn't gonna stand by and watch me self destruct. But we're talkin' again. First time in years. - What finally changed? - Well, I don't know if it was a light bulb ah ha moment, really. It was just, just kinda came in flashes. - Hm. - But I will never forget the day that I saw your first book, "the night hero" displayed in the window of leafing through books. I was so excited for you. But it was also a reminder that I had missed the train. - No, like you said earlier, you can't regret your past. It takes time to discover who we are and what we want outta life. - (chuckles) it's easy for you to say. Not only did you find your passion, you saw it to fruition. - Not entirely. I'm discovering there are some things I've missed out on, too. - Oh, like what? - No, we are on the subject of kit right now. (kit chuckles) mm hm. - I see. - There has to be something you're passionate about. - Nothin' next level like writin' a book. - Oh, who said it has to be next level? Think about it. If you could have anything in life, what would it be? - I think I'm startin' to know the answer to that, but it scares me a little bit. - Well, being scared is a good sign. Means you're onto something. - I'm onto somethin'? - How can I know if you won't tell me what that something is? - I guess time will tell. Let's get outta here. (gentle music) (tailgate slams) (music continues) (no audio) - welcome back to "hey, good day." (audience cheering) (audience applauding) today we're in autumnboro, vermont with one of my new favorite writers, amy fox. Hello, amy. - Thank you for having me, holly. - I gotta tell you, I was up all night reading "vampire rising," and I'm shooting a morning show here! (all laughing) - well, trust me, this book has kept me up more than a few nights. - "vampire rising" is the third book in the dmitri series. What do you think will surprise readers most? - Well, if I told you that no one would buy the book. (audience laughs) (lillian laughs) (kit laughs) let's just say that the dmitri we met at the beginning of the series undergoes a dramatic transformation that will forever change the way we view him. - Amy's a natural at this. - You're just seeing that now? - Well, this is so much more than writing. She's like, self-promoting, and she's like, handling these off the cuff questions. It's like she's managing her own business, you know? - Because that's exactly what she is doing. All this hoopla amy created without any of our help. - Yeah, yeah. - Thank you so much, amy. We'll be right back. (audience cheering) (audience applauding) - go amy! (gasps) freshly laundered as requested. - Oh mom, you're the best. Lack of clean clothes must be a sign I've overstayed my welcome. - Are you kidding? Four days will never be long enough for me, but I am curious, what convinced you to stay for scarecrow night? - Talking with kit made me realize how much I love these times, and what I've missed by avoiding them. - You know, I'm learning that life isn't all or nothing. You get to decide which parts of your past you wanna keep and you can always change your mind. - I wish I could change my mind about waking up at the crack of dawn tomorrow. - There will be coffee. (amy chuckles) (lillian chuckles) ♪ oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ just a little taste of home ♪ ♪ oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ I need a little taste of home ♪ - all right, ladies and gents, welcome to foliage fest's annual scarecrow contest. (all cheering) (all applauding) now, the scarecrows you build will be eligible for the best scarecrow prize awarded the final night of the festival, night cap. But today we host our timed competition to see who can build the most scarecrows. Oh, and I also wanted to mention we have a former three time champ among us. She's also our best selling author, amy fox. (all cheering) (all applauding) so, I think we're all gonna have to play our a game. - All right, everybody. Everybody in their place? - No cheating. (amy laughs) - have fun now. Here we go. And- - you ready? - Three, two, one, start. (upbeat music) (singer vocalizing) - oh, wow. - You think you still got it? - Think? I know. (kit laughs) (amy chuckles) ♪ this is why we live ♪ - okay. ♪ for moments like this, yeah ♪ - what is this? - Oh, no! Did somebody accidentally put in a small flannel in your pile? - That's sabotage. - I call it strategy. (amy giggles) - you are such a cheater. - We have one minute left. Keep goin', now. - Hurry! - Oh! - [tom] one minute left. - What? No (gasps)! - I'm sorry, I needed straw. - Rude! - All right, here we go now. In three, two, one, hands up everybody, hands up. And from my count, ah, we have a brand new winner here. Four scarecrows. God, that's wonderful. - Hey, way to go. - It feels good being in on something together again, doesn't it? - Yeah, everything but the losing part. - We still got a shot at best scarecrow. Of course, you'd have to be at night cap to receive the prize. - Yeah, I'll be mid tour. - Right. - [amy] congratulations. That was very impressive effort. (amy speaking faintly) (somber music) - you know, I think today was a record turnout. - Mm. Just remember the scarecrow with the blue apron is mine and luke's. - (chuckles) okay. - It's you and luke now? Mm, mm hm. (lillian giggling) (ringtone playing) (phone vibrating) don't you need to answer that? - It's my client. It's well after work hours. We'll talk in the morning. But I do need some rest. It's time. - Yeah, I think I'm gonna head out, too. Early day tomorrow. - Well, I need to head out tomorrow. - Right. Safe trip home. - Yeah. - Love you, dad. - I love you, darlin'. - Oh, it was a good day. Hey. Oh, let's just save our goodbye for the morning. - Yes. - Can we do that? - Deal. - Oh, I love you, baby. - I love you. - Okay, sweet dreams. - Thank you. (phone chiming) what? Did mom forget her phone? - Oh, oh, wait a second. That's me. - Oh, right. - Forgot to turn this thing off. Online sales. - Oh. - Yeah. (phone beeps) you may have gotten national coverage this week, but so did this shop. - I think we can both expect a sales boost. - It's more than that, darlin'. You know, you supported my business this week more than I ever supported yours. - My business? You mean my writing? - Because you are gonna have a record year. - (chuckles) well, kit set up the online ordering. - Well, you can get a little credit, you know? (amy laughs) (tom chuckles) but you know, people are gonna come floodin' into this shop and they're gonna be wantin' copies of your books. - My books, here? - Mm hm. - Well, I think I can come up with a solve for that. - Well, you know me, I don't like to sell anything that I haven't tested and tried out myself. - Wait, you wanna read one of my books? - Absolutely. - I don't know. You're always such an expert at everything you sell, this really wouldn't work unless you read the entire series. - All right. (amy chuckles) but I don't wanna wait a couple of weeks for this "vampire rising" book. - Well, now that I can solve. I happen to have an advanced copy in my car. - Well, young lady, you go get that. - Yeah? - Right now. - Okay (laughs). I'll be right back. - All right. Yeah. (gentle music) oh, look at you (grunts). Well, that's gotta be fixed. (music continues) (music continues) (music continues) - one copy of "vampire rising" with your name on it. Grandpa? No! No, no, no, no. Grandpa? Grandpa, can you hear me? Are you okay? Grandpa (panting)? (no audio) is there any word? - The doctor will be out as soon as there's an update. - Thank you. (phone ringing) (amy exhales) - I'm sure kit's just as worried about your grandpa as we are. (amy sighs) (phone chimes) (text message whooshing) - oh, if I just, I hadn't gone back to get the book I could have stopped grandpa from getting on that ladder. - This isn't your fault. - Just, in my heart I knew that something like this would happen and I just, I ignored my instincts. - Honey, I understand how you're feeling, but blaming yourself won't accomplish anything. - Then what will? - Oh, come here. Come here, aw honey. (amy sobbing) how about we just focus on the love we have for your grandpa. - Okay. - Okay? And we concentrate on getting him through this. - (sighs) okay. - Okay. (phone chimes) (amy exhales) - thanks a lot. (gentle music) (music continues) - lillian fox? - Yes? - I'm dr. Smith. I have good news. Your father's regained consciousness. Now, he is banged up. (lillian exhales) he suffered a few fractured ribs, but he's gonna be okay. (lillian laughs) - [lillian] oh! Oh dad, thank goodness you're okay. - Probably changing a burnout light bulb with one wonky arm was not my best decision. - Couldn't you have had that realization before you got up on that ladder? - It takes a few strikes to knock some sense into me, it's a family tradition. (lillian sighs) - I don't wanna worry about a next time, where maybe mom or I don't happen to be here. - Could we have this discussion some other time when I'm not in concussion protocol? - No, because by then you'll be feeling a little bit better and act like none of this happened. Now, we need to have this discussion right now. - Oh honey, I think maybe your grandpa's right about this one. - Mom, please stop defending him. You were just as devastated as me. (tom sighs) (amy sighs) all we want is to know that you're safe even when we're not around. - Your mother's around most of the time. - I have a lot going on, dad. - What you're saying is when you're not around, huh? - This past week, you've seen a perfect example of why I can't always be here. Please. For me and mom, just make the move to oakwood. I know that that decision involves selling pumpkin everything, but I'm telling you, it's time. - Oh, man. For years I scrimped and I saved to build my dream. It's everything to me. - And moving on in your life will never change any of that. - Oh, baby, I've seen so many businesses shutter and turn into insurance agencies. - We can build a contract for that, dad. - Yeah. - Oh, they tell you exactly what you wanna hear until the ink's dry on the contract. It's my dream. It's my passion. You can't put that in a book or a movie. It's in the brick and mortar of that building. It's (sighs)... - Is it worth risking the very life you're trying to preserve? - Some dreams are so much more important than what's going on in the present. - No. - Yeah. - No, I'm sorry. I can't accept that. - It's not your decision to make. This is my life, and I'm gonna live it the way I choose. I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry. - Then why did I even get involved in trying to make things better? Feel like everyone would've been a lot happier if I just showed up for two days and kept my mouth shut, myself included. - Oh honey, no. Honey, amy, (amy sobbing) please just wait, honey. (somber music) (amy panting) - amy! Hey. - Why aren't you at the shop? - I closed up for a bit. I hadn't heard from you and your mom, so I got worried. - Grandpa's fine. Yeah, he's awake and I'm sure if he has his say in it, he'll be back at pumpkin everything changing light bulbs in no time. - Given the state you're in I thought things had taken a turn for the worst. - He won't bend, kit. He refuses to make changes and there's nothing I, or anyone can do about it. I- - hey. Here. It's not- - it's okay, it's okay. Shh. (amy sobbing) it's gonna be okay. - That's just it, no. It won't. Now I have to go. - You're not gonna come back are you? As long as I'm around. - What are you talking about? - The way you just pulled away from me. You did the same thing at the scarecrow contest. Amy, it's not just like old times between us, is it? - I wanted to make things right between us, not complicate them. - You haven't. We needed this time. Yeah, it's been 15 years, but I think we're exactly where we're supposed to be. - My grandpa is in the hospital. - I know, and that's something that you have no control over, but where you and I are concerned, you do have a say, and yet you're running. - I have a book tour. - Amy, I'm in a good place. I wish you knew you were, too. (melancholy music) (amy panting) (no audio) (gentle music) - miss fox, do you have time to sign one more copy? - I'd love to. (avid fan giggles) (music continues) - thank you. (amy sighs) (music continues) - you haven't lived till you've tried our fall spice latte. It's a full on autumn fantasy. - Sounds perfect. - Can I get a name for the cup? - Amy, thanks. (melancholy music) (amy chuckles) (amy sighs) (music continues) (music continues) - got it? - Yeah. - Easy now. - Oh, I hate that pillow. - Here. - Oh. Oo. - Oh, the groceries are all put away. Oh, welcome home, dad. Oh! And now that you're back, I have some proposals for you to review. - A ramp for the front porch? Look, the doctor said this cane was temporary. - The doctor also said that stairs are no longer your friend and that railings and gradual inclines are. I know you hate hearing it, but there was truth in what amy said. Your way of living has to change, dad. - All right, I'll look at it tomorrow. - Okay. Okay, fair enough. I, yeah, I've gotta get back to the office. You sure you're okay? - I'll be right next door at tom's beck and call. - Okay, okay, okay. Mwah. Thank you. - Of course. - [lillian] call me if you need anything. - Yeah. - Okay, bye boys. - Bye. - Is she gone? - Yeah. (door closes) (ice pack thuds) (gentle music) - oh. - Hm. Some of these aren't half bad. - What, you'd want somethin' like that stickin' out the front of your house so everyone goin' by can see it? No, no. (tom sighs) - so, what is your plan then? (tom sighs) I've made every effort to stay outta your personal business. But if the only thing that's stoppin' ya from movin' to oakwood is the future of pumpkin everything then maybe, maybe you gotta hear me out. - Well, I am a bit of a captive audience at the moment, aren't I? - That's true. - Yeah. - No one is ever gonna fully understand your love of pumpkin everything and the life that it's given you, but the longer that I'm there, the more I'm startin' to feel like I can relate to what you're goin' through. - So you understand why it's almost impossible for me to let go of everything? - Yeah. Because aside from you, no one needs pumpkin everything more than me. - I never really looked at it that way before. - You and your shop are what set my life back on course. - Well, you did your fair share keepin' me on course, too. - Tom, no matter what you decide, I'll see to that your life's work will forever be honored in this town. - You really understand an old guy like me, don't ya? Yeah. Come on, go get us a cuppa tea. And I'm gonna hold you that promise, too. (gentle music) (jazzy music) (tom sighs) (music continues) (music continues) (music continues) oh. (music continues) (music continues) (music fades) - thank you. - Thank you so much. - Enjoy. - (sighs) thank you. We haven't sold out during a book signing in a long time. - It's an honor. Honestly, this place is where I fell in love with reading. - I bet you say that to all the bookstore managers. (amy chuckles) I gotta decorate. - Of course. (gentle music) would you like some help? - Really? Someone like you has time for something like this? - Why can't I do both? Point me to your stapler. (gentle music) (music continues) (tom sighs) (music continues) (no audio) (gentle music) (music continues) (phone chimes) (music continues) (text message whooshing) (amy sighs) - hey, everybody. Word is jack frost is gonna be payin' us an early visit this evening, so we'd be wantin' to bring those plants in. And I've got a little diddy comin' up here to warm us up. It'll be the number I go out on and I wanna thank you for lettin' me spend time with ya today. My name's tom, and here it is. (upbeat jazzy music) - dude, you're a total natural. I'm blown away. - Yeah, I was little apprehensive there for a bit, but you think anyone was listening? - Only of all of town square. I mean, stations piped in so they're our captive audience. - Too bad it's not philadelphia too, huh? - Mm, well, today autumnboro, tomorrow the world. - Look, I know you probably got a lotta people lined up for this slot, but- - yeah. No one worth calling back. Ya didn't hear that from me. I just gotta see if oakwood will make an exception for one non-resident dj. They love their red tape, but leave it to me. - You know, mags, I've been reconsidering this whole residency thing and if you got time, maybe you could show me around oakwood again? - I would love that. Let's go. - Okay. (ringtone playing) hello? - [carla] how's america's favorite writer? - You know that question always makes me anxious, right? - So, I did a little schedule juggling- - and that's why. - I had no choice. Your readers are literally obsessed. I mean, this town would not take no for an answer. - But will you take no for an answer? - Please? For me? - Fine, but after this, no more changes or additions. Where to? - Autumnboro. - I wouldn't say I have a legion of fans there, especially right now. - Well, the calls I've received would suggest otherwise. - Okay, name one person who actually called. - [carla] oh, my boss is on the other line. - Oh- - your car is waiting. Bye. (call disconnects) - well... (playful music) - kit, stop fussing. Come on, have a seat. I wanna talk to ya. Place looks great. You've done a phenomenal job. We're gonna have the party of the century. - (chuckles) well, if the weather holds. - Yeah, nothin's gonna ruin this party tonight. Here, look. I got somethin' for you. Have a look. - What's this? - Open it up. That's a check of all last month's online sales and it's made out to you. - Tom (laughs)... Tom, this is way too much. - If my calculations are correct, this month they'll far exceed that, and you'll have more than enough for a down payment. - Yeah, I'm good with the truck I have. - I ain't talkin' about your truck. I'm talkin' about you havin' a down payment for a business of your own. - Well, yeah, maybe one day when I'm ready. - The business I'm thinkin' about probably needs you more than you need it. (gentle music) - you want me to buy pumpkin everything? - I can't think of anyone else I'd rather sell to, son. (gentle music) (bright music) - welcome to autumnboro, ms. Fox. - Oh, we just passed leafing through, the town bookstore. It's so tiny you probably missed it. - I wasn't given the address to a leafing through. - Oh, what address do you have? - 572 main street. - But that's... Nevermind. Thank you. (gentle music) (all chattering) (jazzy music) - oh, hi ladies. - You know, I don't think I've heard your phone all day. - (gasps) oh, that's because someone told me about this new invention called do not disturb. (luke laughs) (lillian chuckles) it's amy (giggles). (gentle music) - thank you. (amy sighs) (music continues) - hey darling, what do you think? - This really is a book signing? - Uh huh. It's the only way I could get them to let you come to foliage fest night cap. And I just hated the way we left things. - We can't waste time being angry with each other. - I'm the one who wasted time, you know, not supporting the fabulous woman that you've become. You know, never celebrating your gifts, your amazing talents, your grace, and that huge heart of yours. It's so evident in all your writing. I've just been a silly old fool. - You will always be my hero, and there's no one in the world that I want to impress more. - Well, it's been quite evident. Look, for all the times I'd got in the way, that was wrong of me. I'm so sorry. But I love you. - Grandpa, I love you too. Come here. (gentle music) - so, right here right now, why don't we just start over, make this a completely new chapter? Pun intended. (amy laughs) - I love it. - Ah. - Ah! Amy, you made it! - Hi. - Come, come sit. - Okay. - [lillian] you remember luke? - Yes. - Hi, amy. (tom sighs) (jazzy music fades) - hello, everybody. I want to thank you for attending this, the 30th anniversary of night cap. (audience cheering) (audience applauding) I love the timelessness of this celebration, and to think that my very talented granddaughter, amy, in this courtyard took her very first steps and now she is a nationally acclaimed best selling author. (audience cheering) (audience applauding) when amy came to me and said that she wanted to write vampire stories, those of you who know me could only imagine how I bristled. (audience laughing) but once I cracked open "vampire rising" and I realized it was the story of a family man and how his want for the very best for his family had blinded him to the passions and the desires of the very people he cherished. Look, enough of the musings of a very proud grandfather. My granddaughter, amy fox. (audience cheering) (audience applauding) (gentle music) (jazzy music) - thank you. - Thank you so much. - How are you holdin' up? - You know, I think this is pumpkin everything's best night cap yet. - Mm, and the first one where I'm not the owner. - You sold pumpkin everything? - Mm hm. Well, I can't spin records at oakwood unless I'm a resident, can I? - That wasn't enough two weeks ago. - No, but I think I found the perfect person to carry on pumpkin everything's legacy. - Who? (jazzy music) - (sighs) of course. (music continues) congratulations. I'm happy for you, kit. - Thank you. Although, I gotta tell ya, the business scares the heck outta me. Must mean that I'm onto somethin'. - Here. - Sorry? - Right now, this is where I wanna be. - Well, we'll always be where we need to be, for ourselves, for each other. - I believe that now. - Amy, I'm never gonna get in the way of your writing, everything you've accomplished. I just want a chance with you. - That is by far the scariest thing I've ever heard. - Terrifying, right? (amy chuckles) is that a yes? - It's an absolute yes (laughs).
