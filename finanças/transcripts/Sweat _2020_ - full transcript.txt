Your wonderful energy comes straight back to me. Today... I felt it and it really moved me. Moments like today make me feel that we are one. And I really want to thank you for that. I love this song, I love Roxette! I can move mountains with you! I love you all! Hi, sunshine! - Don't talk to me with your mouth full. - I'm sorry. - Want something? - No, thanks.

Hesitating? - I dunno. - 'Dunno' what? - So call them. - I did. And? They're still I planning the content. Wait, I thought we were booked? What can I offer you? Weren't we booked? Apparently the host works out with Patti Wola. So they want to invite her instead of me? I don't know, it's just gossip. So now the host gets to choose the guests, I don't get? This is not good, it was supposed to be sorted. - Maybe some sparkling water. - Of course. Have you read the gossip sites lately? Thai video you posted has kind of gone viral, you know? Really which one? The one of you crying. Are you alright? Why are you asking? You looked kind of sad in it. So what? Are you worried about me? Should I be? I don't know, that's up to you. One of the sponsors complained. - Oh yeah, who? - Olympus Nutrition. They're worried about their product appearing in that kind of context. - Sorry, but I post what I want. - That's what I told them, girl. Don't worry about it. My loves... if you don't know. whether to take the stairs or the lift... This is my advice take the stairs... no matter how man, bags you're carrying. I'm nearly there.

I will spare you the noise. It's great I highly recommend it. I will drink it in a moment, so come and join me. Bye, bye. SYLWIA ZAJAC CRYING. WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE TRAINER'S LIFE? 'I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO HAVE SOMEONE SPECIAL BY MY SIDE'. Hi, my loves... I hope you all had a good day. This video will be a little different than usual. I mean, not everything has to be about fitness. You often ask me... why I'm single. Why I don't have a husband or a boyfriend. The truth is that. I didn't choose to be single. In fact... a while ago... a friend who... was always alone... who was always single... found someone. I was really happy when I found out, and I wish her all the best fingers crossed, for her new relationship... but at the same time I, uh. I just felt really, really sad. Because I just... Um... I'd really like to have someone close... someone who... who would take my hand and say... 'Sylwia, my love... everything's going to be alright'. Come on, my love. Alright. Alright, alright. God, you're pulling me... He's met his friend! Jackson! Jackson! Where's the ball? Excuse me. Excuse me, hello? Can I help you, sir? Hello, excuse me! For fuck's sake. Jackson! Why the fuck... Why the fuck are you staring at me?! Fucking pervert! Fuck off! Fuck off! Fuck! I'm sorry baby. Wait, wait. I'm sorry, Jackson. Jesus, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Hi, my love. - Hi, mummy. Hi. I'm sorry I hung up on you last time. The connection broke off in the garage... and then I had to take Jackson for a walk. Aren't you sleeping yet? - No. - What are you doing? Watching the match. What match? - Serena's playing. - Which channel is it on? TVP Sport. I'll be there tomorrow. I'm coming to visit you. Oh yeah? I'm glad to hear that. - I've got a surprise for you - What surprise? I can't tell you, because then it wouldn't be a surprise. You'll meet Fryderyk. Is he going to be there? - Why would he not be? - I didn't realize it was so serious. It is. OK mum, I'm going to go now. Alright, my love get some rest. Yeah... Bye then. Bye. Let's see what we've got here, my loves. I can see that these are clothes from their latest collection. I really like it. Cool sweatshirt. TRX. You know what this is, I work out with it a lot. And this? 'UchFit'. Some kind of magnet. OK... But what is it for? 'This is UchFit your personal hanger for the things you take to the gym'. 'You can attach it to any steel surface at the gym'. Listen, guys... I won't tell you what this is. This box... Just a regular box. Is a present from my beloved people from Fiat. And inside... Damn! It's moving. I'm riding. This is fantastic! 'I want legs like yours'. Listen. if you work out with me, you'll have legs like mine. 'I've always wondered if your hair is natural?' It is. 'I can see you!'. Yeah! My arm is starting to hurt. Big kisses, guys. Have a good evening. Bye. Sylwia thanks to you, I'm back in shape. You motivate me every day 'You are amazing. - Hello, good morning. - Hello, this is Sylwia Zajac. - Hello, Ms. Sylwia. - Good morning. How are you? Fine, thank you I've just received the meals. That's good, I hope everything is alright. Yes, but they're packed in plastic boxes. OK, let me check, I didn't take your order... Good morning. Good morning, we hadn't agreed on plastic boxes. I've use as little plastic as possible. We are trying the best we can... ...the bag is made of paper... We're really trying. Yes but it's not enough. I'm not going to promote plastic. We're looking for greener solutions, but it's really not that easy. Hi, Sylwia... - Hello, Ms. Sylwia? - Either you switch to... biodegradable boxes or... I'll find another catering company. ...because of how I... treated you... today. At the car park. Sylwia... I'm sorry! I'm very, very sorry. My Name is Rysiek. Rysiu. Mummy would call: 'Rysiu, Rysiu'! She'd always say: 'Don't do bad things! Rysiu!' I just wanted to say that we're very much alike. I also want someone to hold hands with. Someone to hug. To talk to... about my feelings. I know. I know I'm not good enough for you, I'm sorry. Thanks for the workout, Sylwia! It was awesome! You're an amazing woman! We love you with all our hearts! More weights? You're weak today, huh? - Weak? - Yeah. - Watch this, - Come on. Let's go... And up. Push hard. I'm resisting. Go, go, go! That's it. Again... and up Harder. Harder. As far as you can! That's it. Again... Go, go, go! You can do more. That's it. Again... Knees wider... And go. Come on. - Jesus. I can't! - That's it. Up. Push, push. Push harder. Hold it... now slowly down. - Are you alive? - Uh huh. You won't get up tomorrow. OK. Hi loves. Have you worked today? if not - don't worry, you can still go. Remember! The only bad workout is the one that never happened. I'm already done. Hi loves. Have you worked out today? If not - don't worry you can still go. Remember! The only bad workout... Sylwia! Sylwia, hi! Hi! - God! - Oh my gosh! What a surprise. How are you? Great! It's great to see you! I'd love to have your ass. You look good too. - Oh, stop it! - Really! Come on. no way. By the way I've been following you. Yeah. And. I have to tell you... You're great, really true and honest. I left all my stuff over there... How about we sit down for a chat? - Or are you in a hurry? - I have to buy a present. - Great. Who for? - My mum. - Do you want to order something? - No thanks. You know what... Sleepy has a great pajama collection. Have a look there. Seriously. Mums love pajamas. Yeah... I can't get enough of you! Looking at you takes me back to school. - Yes? - Yes. I got married two years ago. Yeah... His name is Ryszard... he works in television. - You know we live in Konstancin... - Oh, wow... - That's great. - Yeah. I mean... Right now... It's kind of... It's kind of not that great right now. I'm a mess, actually. I'm kind of.. Well... I mean, I'm feeling a bit strange. No, no. Don't tell me if you don't want to. No, I mean, it's... It's alright. Yeah. I kind of... I haven't talked to anyone for a long time. I was in the tenth week... And I went... ...to my gynaecologist for a check-up. Just a routine check-up. I didn't feel anything strange... and suddenly he goes: 'Oops... No heartbeat'. So he asked me whether... ...whether I wanted them to take her out. or whether I wanted 'nature' to get rid of her. I didn't know. I called them later and. I wanted them to get and of her... I don't know why I say 'her' when I don't even know.... I've just always wanted to have a daughter, you know? - Answer it, - No, no, I don't have to. When... I found out I was going to be a mum... I know it's stupid, but I started calling everyone because I was super happy. Because that's the point if you can't share it? Now I don't want to talk to anyone. I'm sorry. But you can try again, right? I don't want to, you know? I can't imagine going through all of that again. I just couldn't do it. Sometimes... I feel like quitting my job. I'd like to delete my Instagram account because no one would really miss me. I know it. It would just take one click and everything would disappear. Just like that. Sylwia... I'm sure you'll manage, no matter what you decide to do. Yep. Listen... I have to go. Let's take a selfie! - Yeah? - Alright. Wait... OK. One more time... Hey there. How are you guys? Like I was telling you earlier... I slept really badly and I got up on the wrong side of bed. so I figured I have to do something really nice for myself today. I've been craving a nice, positive colour, so I thought about pink. So what colour are we doing Zosia? Neon pink? So watch out for the final effect. Wait for it... Kisses! Hey there. How are you guys? Like I was telling you earlier... I slept really badly and... Yes? You're on "Good Morning TVN" tomorrow! - We got it? - Do you think I wouldn't have got it for you? That's wonderful. They just confirmed. They really want you. - Great - Yep. Listen, did you tell them... - What? - ...what song to play? My darling, I told them ages ago. Are you happy or not? 'Cause I can't tell. Of course, I'm really happy. Makeup is at 8 a.m., you're on at 8:15. - OK - Should I go with you? No, no. Are you sure? It's not a problem for me... OK, bye. Amazing. Bye bye. Hello my loves... I hope you're having a great day? I certainly am. Some quick news from me... Tomorrow at 8:15 a.m. I'll show you... Whoops. I'll show you the perfect morning workout...

But what for? - Why so many presents? - Because I love you! What are you carrying. I promised I'd give it to you! - Jesus, child - Where should I put it? Well, uh... Over there. - In the bedroom. - Don't be silly. - You're not going to... - Do you want it in the bedroom? Just for the time being. - It's too big for the living room. - Stop it mum. What are you... Is that a plasma? - Is it a plasma? - Where is he? Come here Jackson darling, there you go... There. Not there, it looks like a tree! It's an LED. it will get in people's way. Are you going to... - ...connect it? - It's too big in here. It always seems so difficult. There are so many cables and plugs... But it all works out in the end. Jesus! I'll let them in. Leave it! Clean the chairs from the basement! - I will. - Hello, come in. - They're coming. - Great. - Help me. - Alright. - What do you need... - I left that one out. And the curlers. Right. Unless you want to leave one in? - It looks nice... - Can you calm down? Button it up at the back, please. Aren't you beautiful? Come on... Alright thanks... come on. - Jesus, they're coming. - Wait, wait! - Happy birthday to you! - You are beautiful. - Happy birthday to you! - Basia, darling! Happy birthday!

We couldn't believe it when Basia told us you were coming. What do we have here? What a belly!

I want it out of my body. I understand you When I was pregnant with Sylwia... The whole time, I felt... bleh! I felt sick the whole time. I never felt sick when I was pregnant with you two.

'...It was thanks to my mum... who would send me to all kinds of sports clubs. and summer camps when I was a kid...' 'Volleyball, swimming, tennis, cross-country running...' 'After years later, my boyfriend took me to the gym. I fell in love.' 'Not with him, but with the gym.' 'Why do you love fitness?' 'We all know we should take care of our bodies... but sports are often last on our lists...' - Wait! - 'of priorities.' 'Isn't that strange?' 'We go crazy when our phone batteries are running love...' but we do nothing to prevent our health batteries from running out.' 'I want to raise awareness and inspire change...' - 'I want everyone...' - Don't shout! 'to become the best versions of ourselves.' Let's put it on! - No, no, please. - Why not? Sylwia brought us a new TV set. - Really? - Yes, It's an LED. - Wow! - Yes, an LED. Right, I think the TV is on... Not much space... what a huge TV set! Sylwia, Photoshop? No way! Look at me, then the photo. don't we look exactly the same? - Don't those nails get in the way? - Attention! No, it doesn't. - Wow! - Which one, this one? - I don't know, whichever you want. - Click on 'workout'. Sylwia Zajac! Bravo! Bravo! - Move, mum. - What? Turn it up a bit.

Look, here's Kacper. - Look at you running. - Well done! Bravo! Basia! I go to a class called 'Yoga for a Healthy Back'. 0h Jesus! - Kacper, I told you! -1 didn't break it.

And to the mum who raised her. - Where's mum? - Basia dear, come here. - Basia, to your health! - I'm coming. I'm coming. - I drank mine, but... - You want some? Quiet now.

Are all of you veggie, too? - Veggie or whatever... - Veggie one day, homo the next. My son is quite the comedian. Everyone always seems to think... that the fitness world is all happy and colorful. But it's not really like that. It also has its dark sides. Yesterday, I found this out for myself. I realised I have a stalker. - A what? - A stalker. - A stalker. - Someone who follows you. I know, I know. Yesterday, I went for a walk with Jackson and... I could feel someone watching me. I was right. There was a guy sitting in a car outside my building. he was looking at me in a strange way. For a long time. I went up to him, Knocked on the window and asked. what was going on? He didn't answer, He just kept looking at me. So I knocked again. And suddenly, he took out... He took out his dick and... started to masturbate. Son of a bitch. That's just sick. This morning... He sent me a video of him apologizing. and crying. He was saying... How important I am to him and how he adores me. - What a nutcase! - He's just some disgusting, fat guy. Sylwia, darling, you have to be careful. There are so many crazy people out there. taking advantage of good people. - It's sick. - It is sick. Because all I want... is to inspire people to lead healthy lives. What did you knock on his window top. Couldn't you have just walked past him? It was in his car, his window, wasn't it. Because he was staring at me! So you go banging on the window of anyone who stares at you? I mean... I don't understand. That could have been dangerous. Exactly, banging on someone's window. No, mum, he was the dangerous one. He's a stalker, he... he's sick, he could hurt me. I don't know, but... I know there are all kinds of people, but... You can't judge people like that. Maybe he a as a nice guy. Does he sound like a nice guy? Yeah? Is that how you met him? You walked past his car as he was jerking off, is that a nice guy? - Sylwia! - Your guy. A nice guy. Yeah? If you want I can tell you how we really met. No, thank you very much. We don't have to. - Sylwia, darling? - Yes? Can't you just be happy for your mother? She was alone for such a long time and now she's finally found someone... Isn't that a good thing? Can't you be happy for her? I am happy. Then what's going on? Come on. Have some cake with us. I don't eat cake. Come on nothing will happen if you eat a bit of cake for once in your life. Come. I'm coming. Look who I brought back! Good. Come on, come on. Come on, we're about to... I'll just get the forks. - Mum? - What? - I'm sorry about how I behaved. - Sit down, it's no problem. I'd like to apologize for what I said. - It doesn't matter Sylwia dear. - Sit down and have some cake. Mum... Mum, wait. Listen to me. - I love you. - Alright child, sit down. - It's not a problem. - Let's sing, shall we? - Andrzej... - Yes, thank you, just a moment. We have to... wait... Basia has to make a wish and blow out the candles. I think I know what I wish for. Right. I have this one wish. and I think it will come true this evening... - Then blow! - Blow! Well done!

Ms. Sylwia doesn't have anywhere to warm up and... Thanks. Eight, seven, six, five... This is the sound technician... Do you need some water? ...the girl who took the fitness market by storm. Good morning. - Hello, I'm Milosz. - Sylwia. Three minutes. Thanks, we're clean. No let's move to the sofa for the meeting with Sylwia Zajac. - There you go. - Thanks. - Ready? - Good. - 2 minutes left. - We've got Sylwia. Alright, Ms. Sylwia, follow me. Six... She is beautiful, young, talented and full of energy. Ladies and gentlemen, Sylwia Zajac. The latest fitness revelation, we could say. She is... She is already recognized for her energetic and effective workout plans... but also her strong presence social media. - Hello Sylwia. Welcome. - Hello. I'm very pleased to be here with you. It's very nice to meet you. It's great that you brought Jackson with you. Yes, yes. I think he is in the kitchen... Let's explain... Jackson is a little dog... Does Jackson have a profile too? He doesn't have a profile, but he has a hashtag. So... Hashtag Jackson... - Yes. - It sounds, grandiose. Sylwia, please tell us how many followers you have now? Around 600 000. 600 000 Followers, that's people who watch you all the time. - Every post, right? - Yes. That's an impressive number indeed. So you're very popular. It's interesting to see how you use this, so let's watch one of your last posts. This is a part of the video where you... express a lot of emotions. We are watching the vira1 video right now. this is the moment when you share with your fans That you would like to have a boyfriend... I want to ask: do you really need to take this so far? Do you have to expose yourself like this? Do you think... That we can show everything off these days? That it's all for sale? Isn't this too much? I don't know, it comes with the job. What do you mean by 'the job'? 'It comes with the job'. What does that mean? If I want to inspire people... I have to show them that I have my good days and my bad days. Yes, but isn't it a little too much? Maybe you should focus on your domain, your specialization, that is - fitness? Why share the drama in your life? Let's be honest, the post was very moving. But I have another question. You deal with motivating people. all over Poland, but... What motivates you? Sylwia? What's wrong with the fact that I admitted... That right now there's no one in my life who loves me? Does that mean... That... That I'm weak? Or... I don't know... pathetic? In that case I want to be weak and pathetic, because that's when I'm myself. When I'm the awesome Sylwia from the posters... I feel very lonely... And I'm just tired of pretending. that I'm better than I really am. I'm tired. of worrying that I'm not good enough. I'm tired of it. I want to be that weak, pathetic Sylwia... because weak pathetic people are the most beautiful people. Thousands of people watched my video. Those thousands of people accept me just the way I am. And they don't even know. that they mean more to me than I do to them. I love them. I love them with all my heart. Sylwia, is everything alright? Yes. It's true that I've had a few intense, rough days... But I'm doing well. What happened... If you can tell us? I might tell you, if you follow me on social media. Well... The ball is in your court now Andrzej. You have to create an account. I think I will. Sylwia, this is when you were supposed to show us your workout. But I don't know if you're ready for it after all those emotions... You've really shaken us here so maybe we should just skip it? No Right now... - I really feel like working out. -OK. Alright in that case the stage is yours. Music, please. My Loves. I'm sure you know that moment when you wake up... and your body's still asleep and your mind is dreaming? I'm about to show you the best morning workout routine. Arms. forward. Big circles. Let your body stretch. Let your arms work, your chest open. And up! To the sides! One, two, three, four. My loves, you can repeat this on the other side. Thank you so much. Have a good day.
