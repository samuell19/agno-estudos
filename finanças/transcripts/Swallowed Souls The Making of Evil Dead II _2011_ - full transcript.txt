playing Scotty and I think he got too expensive Scotty and I think he got too expensive Scotty and I think he got too expensive so they just kind of tossed it out and so they just kind of tossed it out and so they just kind of tossed it out and recondense tit we did end up shooting recondense tit we did end up shooting recondense tit we did end up shooting the book burning in the fireplace I the book burning in the fireplace I the book burning in the fireplace I think that was the only shot for the think that was the only shot for the think that was the only shot for the recap sequence that we filmed I know for a fact that I recommended I know for a fact that I recommended Doug bazevich for they have the dancing Doug bazevich for they have the dancing Doug bazevich for they have the dancing Linda and it was clearly an element Linda and it was clearly an element Linda and it was clearly an element where the wider shots would have to be where the wider shots would have to be where the wider shots would have to be stop motion because we can't have a stop motion because we can't have a stop motion because we can't have a dummy or an actress with a head removed dummy or an actress with a head removed dummy or an actress with a head removed dancing in full shots the choreographer dancing in full shots the choreographer dancing in full shots the choreographer cam warner designed a dance sequence we cam warner designed a dance sequence we cam warner designed a dance sequence we photographed that that dance sequence on photographed that that dance sequence on photographed that that dance sequence on 35 millimeter film and we sent this Roth 35 millimeter film and we sent this Roth 35 millimeter film and we sent this Roth 35 millimeter footage to Sam Raimi and 35 millimeter footage to Sam Raimi and 35 millimeter footage to Sam Raimi and Sam cut together the dance sequence Sam cut together the dance sequence Sam cut together the dance sequence basically the scene was completely built basically the scene was completely built basically the scene was completely built in live action first they sent me of the in live action first they sent me of the in live action first they sent me of the cut footage and then we went to work cut footage and then we went to work cut footage and then we went to work matching that basically frame by frame matching that basically frame by frame matching that basically frame by frame and then I had a crew building the and then I had a crew building the and then I had a crew building the miniature set the supervisor there was miniature set the supervisor there was miniature set the supervisor there was Jim Bella Hovick when Doug Beswick Jim Bella Hovick when Doug Beswick Jim Bella Hovick when Doug Beswick called me up to work on Evil Dead 2 I called me up to work on Evil Dead 2 I called me up to work on Evil Dead 2 I had already worked on aliens the thing had already worked on aliens the thing had already worked on aliens the thing so my skills were starting to get more so my skills were starting to get more so my skills were starting to get more refined my direct job refined my direct job refined my direct job when Doug Beswick hired me was to build when Doug Beswick hired me was to build when Doug Beswick hired me was to build what we call the cabin set so I had to what we call the cabin set so I had to what we call the cabin set so I had to build this cabin and trees that for an build this cabin and trees that for an build this cabin and trees that for an animation setup were going to be a animation setup were going to be a animation setup were going to be a challenge because if Doug would reach challenge because if Doug would reach challenge because if Doug would reach into the set nothing could move the into the set nothing could move the into the set nothing could move the animation was very challenging because animation was very challenging because animation was very challenging because this was you know actually trying to this was you know actually trying to this was you know actually trying to duplicate a performance so it was a bit duplicate a performance so it was a bit duplicate a performance so it was a bit challenging in that respect and it was challenging in that respect and it was challenging in that respect and it was all tabletop so it's a pretty slow all tabletop so it's a pretty slow all tabletop so it's a pretty slow process I would say I probably got maybe process I would say I probably got maybe process I would say I probably got maybe a frame every five minutes you know that a frame every five minutes you know that a frame every five minutes you know that would be at the peak or you work in your would be at the peak or you work in your would be at the peak or you work in your fastest so it's very slow and tedious fastest so it's very slow and tedious fastest so it's very slow and tedious and there's no going back you know if and there's no going back you know if and there's no going back you know if you make a mistake you basically have to you make a mistake you basically have to you make a mistake you basically have to start over my job in the film when it started was my job in the film when it started was just to do the crawling hands or seams just to do the crawling hands or seams just to do the crawling hands or seams and I did fly down there to do the one and I did fly down there to do the one and I did fly down there to do the one long shot because we no way to duplicate long shot because we no way to duplicate long shot because we no way to duplicate that entire room and the rest of them that entire room and the rest of them that entire room and the rest of them were done on a miniature or not a were done on a miniature or not a were done on a miniature or not a miniature but a rebuilt set to match a miniature but a rebuilt set to match a miniature but a rebuilt set to match a small section of the real set and all small section of the real set and all small section of the real set and all the other cuts were done in my studio I the other cuts were done in my studio I the other cuts were done in my studio I had basically had to match the paint job had basically had to match the paint job had basically had to match the paint job get the armature made get that set in get the armature made get that set in get the armature made get that set in the mold right do the foam cast and then the mold right do the foam cast and then the mold right do the foam cast and then took it down on set for them to approve took it down on set for them to approve took it down on set for them to approve Bailey I just stood around most of the Bailey I just stood around most of the Bailey I just stood around most of the day and watched everybody else shoot day and watched everybody else shoot day and watched everybody else shoot scenes and had a good time and then once scenes and had a good time and then once scenes and had a good time and then once they shut down for the day somewhere they shut down for the day somewhere they shut down for the day somewhere around midnight I went in and shot for around midnight I went in and shot for around midnight I went in and shot for about three hours to do the hand about three hours to do the hand about three hours to do the hand crawling across the room and then after crawling across the room and then after crawling across the room and then after we did that they just had so many we did that they just had so many we did that they just had so many effects on the film that Sam or Rob said effects on the film that Sam or Rob said effects on the film that Sam or Rob said could you help us out with some other could you help us out with some other could you help us out with some other shots and that turned into the neck shots and that turned into the neck shots and that turned into the neck growing and head changing transformation growing and head changing transformation growing and head changing transformation scene and a couple other scenes of the scene and a couple other scenes of the scene and a couple other scenes of the bust of Henrietta lunging at the camera bust of Henrietta lunging at the camera bust of Henrietta lunging at the camera and then the full-body puppet with ash and then the full-body puppet with ash and then the full-body puppet with ash swinging the chainsaw and stuff a couple swinging the chainsaw and stuff a couple swinging the chainsaw and stuff a couple of stop-motion cuts of that so it turned of stop-motion cuts of that so it turned of stop-motion cuts of that so it turned into more than initial he was supposed into more than initial he was supposed into more than initial he was supposed to be a lot of the stuff that Tom and I were a lot of the stuff that Tom and I were dealing with were there were things like dealing with were there were things like dealing with were there were things like the Henrietta head coming up out of the the Henrietta head coming up out of the the Henrietta head coming up out of the floor floor floor Mike terrific did the sculpture and at Mike terrific did the sculpture and at Mike terrific did the sculpture and at that point they hadn't put Ted Raimi in that point they hadn't put Ted Raimi in that point they hadn't put Ted Raimi in the Henrietta makeup yet so he sculpted the Henrietta makeup yet so he sculpted the Henrietta makeup yet so he sculpted it so it looked just like the actress it so it looked just like the actress it so it looked just like the actress who was playing Henrietta as a human but who was playing Henrietta as a human but who was playing Henrietta as a human but she doesn't look anything like a Ted she doesn't look anything like a Ted she doesn't look anything like a Ted Raimi as Henrietta as a Deadite and so Raimi as Henrietta as a Deadite and so Raimi as Henrietta as a Deadite and so there's there's that little jarring there's there's that little jarring there's there's that little jarring thing but it's also so quick you don't thing but it's also so quick you don't thing but it's also so quick you don't notice we spent an entire probably notice we spent an entire probably notice we spent an entire probably probably a five or six hour night on set probably a five or six hour night on set probably a five or six hour night on set well ever everything was clear with well ever everything was clear with well ever everything was clear with Bruce just doing the sequence where and Bruce just doing the sequence

the flowers incarnated in the flesh and the flowers incarnated in the flesh and the flowers die in the flower pot behind him and his die in the flower pot behind him and his die in the flower pot behind him and his hair streaks white and we had built a hair streaks white and we had built a hair streaks white and we had built a rig that held Bruce steady so that Tom rig that held Bruce steady so that Tom rig that held Bruce steady so that Tom could animate the white streak in his could animate the white streak in his could animate the white streak in his hair and we had a propane torch that we hair and we had a propane torch that we hair and we had a propane torch that we would intermittently hit the flowers would intermittently hit the flowers would intermittently hit the flowers with in the flower pot so they would with in the flower pot so they would with in the flower pot so they would slowly wilt and fall over as the as the slowly wilt and fall over as the as the slowly wilt and fall over as the as the shot progressed animation just has a shot progressed animation just has a shot progressed animation just has a great look that you can't beat and great look that you can't beat and great look that you can't beat and there's just something really weird there's just something really weird there's just something really weird about it when you start doing it with about it when you start doing it with about it when you start doing it with real people Sam wanted a great scene at the finale Sam wanted a great scene at the finale of a flying Deadite attacking a

the barrel open deep into his hand and as I recall he deep into his hand and as I recall he deep into his hand and as I recall he needed six stitches after that I'm not needed six stitches after that I'm not needed six stitches after that I'm not sure what happened exactly but Sam sure what happened exactly but Sam sure what happened exactly but Sam decided he didn't want his special decided he didn't want his special decided he didn't want his special effects guys on the set which I found to effects guys on the set which I found to effects guys on the set which I found to be really ominous so when we saw the be really ominous so when we saw the be really ominous so when we saw the footage of course it wasn't usable and footage of course it wasn't usable and footage of course it wasn't usable and there were only a couple of shots that there were only a couple of shots that there were only a couple of shots that were and that's what became of the were and that's what became of the were and that's what became of the sequence it goes by so fast no people sequence it goes by so fast no people sequence it goes by so fast no people can't even remember it but that was can't even remember it but that was can't even remember it but that was going to be my ticket to greater going to be my ticket to greater going to be my ticket to greater adventure and stop-motion what a adventure and stop-motion what a adventure and stop-motion what a heartbreaker looking back at working on Evil Dead 2 looking back at working on Evil Dead 2 was a it was a good time and it was a was a it was a good time and it was a was a it was a good time and it was a magical time working with animators who magical time working with animators who magical time working with animators who I wish we could have continued working I wish we could have continued working I wish we could have continued working on animated films like that on animated films like that on animated films like that in retrospect I would say that it was in retrospect I would say that it was in retrospect I would say that it was one of the most interesting projects fun one of the most interesting projects fun one of the most interesting projects fun projects to work on because it seemed to projects to work on because it seemed to projects to work on because it seemed to have a you know real creative energy have a you know real creative energy have a you know real creative energy about it that did you know with you know about it that did you know with you know about it that did you know with you know building the everything was kind of building the everything was kind of building the everything was kind of hands-on back then I'd love to see stop hands-on back then I'd love to see stop hands-on back then I'd love to see stop motion sequences back in the features it motion sequences back in the features it motion sequences back in the features it was fantastic and it was not perfectly was fantastic and it was not perfectly was fantastic and it was not perfectly real but it was was wonderfully real if real but it was was wonderfully real if real but it was was wonderfully real if you know what I mean and those creatures you know what I mean and those creatures you know what I mean and those creatures if they gave them the time and the if they gave them the time and the if they gave them the time and the import on the film and didn't cut away import on the film and didn't cut away import on the film and didn't cut away to mechanicals and just let the to mechanicals and just let the to mechanicals and just let the animation creature be the star I think animation creature be the star I think animation creature be the star I think they were very powerful thought it was they were very powerful thought it was they were very powerful thought it was neat that it turned into a stop-motion neat that it turned into a stop-motion neat that it turned into a stop-motion film film film I love stop-motion and there's just I love stop-motion and there's just I love stop-motion and there's just something cool about the way it looks something cool about the way it looks something cool about the way it looks and I think it works really well for and I think it works really well for and I think it works really well for fantasy and would work well for fantasy and would work well for

kind of the guy who glad that I'm kind of the guy who introduced Sam Raimi to stop-motion introduced Sam Raimi to stop-motion introduced Sam Raimi to stop-motion animation so I was very happy with that the first evil that the problems were the first evil that the problems were tough because we didn't know what we tough because we didn't know what we tough because we didn't know what we were doing there was no unions involved were doing there was no unions involved were doing there was no unions involved we didn't owe anything we've sort of we didn't owe anything we've sort of we didn't owe anything we've sort of made it up and learned a lot only look made it up and learned a lot only look made it up and learned a lot only look back later and went wow what a nightmare back later and went wow what a nightmare back later and went wow what a nightmare that was second she was a huge nightmare that was second she was a huge nightmare that was second she was a huge nightmare so we were like there's got to be a so we were like there's got to be a so we were like there's got to be a better way to do this I don't even know better way to do this I don't even know better way to do this I don't even know if Sam remembers this or not but is in if Sam remembers this or not but is in if Sam remembers this or not but is in fact the case of before he went to go fact the case of before he went to go fact the case of before he went to go make Evil Dead 2 he came over he brought make Evil Dead 2 he came over he brought make Evil Dead 2 he came over he brought over a bottle of scotch and he and I over a bottle of scotch and he and I over a bottle of scotch and he and I drank his bottle of scotch and discussed drank his bottle of scotch and discussed drank his bottle of scotch and discussed production because so far he had made production because so far he had made production because so far he had made two films that the production was insane two films that the production was
