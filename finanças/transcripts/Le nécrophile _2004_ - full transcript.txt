The Necrophiliac The teams are taking the pitch... There's the former coach of Bruges, the Yugoslavian, Anglovich. And there's Allain, Lyon's great penalty taker. Will he finally score his 110th goal? I'd love to see that tonight. In a few minutes, I remind you, there will be something extraodinary. There will be a minute's silence in honor of Pieri, the young player who died tragically on the pitch. Ladies and gentlemen, imagine this stadium, these 48,000 people... The minute of silence has started! The Silence is incredible! Remarkable! We must respect the silence and the appreciation for this player. Everyone be quiet! I'll be quiet. It's incredible, nonetheless. Everyone is quiet. We must respect the silence, under these circumstances. Considering the pain of his family, his career cut short... but I'll be quiet now. One day Police! Open up! Do you know this girl? She's the niece of one of your relatives. Her parents died and you must take her. Would you come with us? You're her only family. We can't keep her. You must take care of her. If you don't take her, we'll start an investigation. Sign or we'll make trouble! You don't want to mess with Social Services! CHILD: OPERATION MANUAL Chapter: Little Girl Another day Hello, do you live here? Is he your father? I can show you how to kiss, If you want. Okay... I'm live from the cemetary where the crime will be reenacted, this abominable crime of violating a tomb. The accused has just arrived. He's getting out of the car. He will take part in the reenactment, but he's always maintained his innocence. What's your name? Sorry, I have to go. Can I see you again? That guy's weird, in any case! That evening What is this? Meat. It tastes strange. That night You found the strength to carry on without her. She may be dead to others, but she's still alive to me. I'm going to tell you something important. Your story is exactly like mine. For the indifferent, Genevieve's eyes have closed. But for you, there is still time. Think that you can no longer lose her. Consecrate every thought to her, every act, all of your love. Death won't consume us if we don't allow it. Believe me... The dead can go on living. Another day... Another evening... Today some cops came here. But I didn't say anything... They wanted to know how I was... They said you were strange... I don't care if you seem strange. When I was little, my mother would kiss me goodnight. Would you kiss me goodnight too? I know everything. Because I don't sleep at night. I saw everything. But I'll never tell... But I never want to eat that meat again, okay? One evening The following day Will you come here? I've missed you. Not me. I don't like you anymore. Look! She's fresh in the ground! At the orphanage I dug holes for trees. If you want, I'll help you... You want to see that? We're going to dig up people. Give me those! He's the one! I saw him throw away some bags. He's the necrophiliac! Dinner's ready. Look behind the dresser! There's a door... Who are those people? They're the family of the latest missing corpse. No one will pardon my body. No one! It's terrible. He ate my daughter. You dressed her in white lace. We can't do anything. We don't have a warrant and besides, there's nothing here. Go away! No one has the right to invade my privacy! I cleaned up everything so they wouldn't find anything. We won't be able to go out anymore, so if you want, I'll substitute for the corpses. It can't be that hard. I just have to keep still. END
