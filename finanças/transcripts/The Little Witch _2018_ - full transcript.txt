[music plays] [glass shattering] [quick, mysterious music] [light, bouncy choral music] [upbeat, bouncy flute music] [Little Witch and Abraxas laughing] - [Abraxas] Are you crazy, this is spring, it's not the season for pine cones. - [Little Witch] Hocus pocus, egg of toad, to me white cloud now quickly float. Draw together open up, hunus, punus, fill our cup. [upbeat, bouncy music] [Little Witch laughing] - [Abraxas] Clothespins, eh, okay. - [Little Witch] Not what I meant. - Why not make it rain something yummy instead, breadcrumbs? Oh, raisins. - I just don't get it, an ordinary rain spell shouldn't be this tricky. All right, I'll try again. - And I shall take cover. - Hocus pocus large in size, to me white cloud now quickly rise, draw together I shall offer, uh, legal-a-loggoly, make the ground softer. [thunder clapping] [light, bouncy flute music] [spoons clinking] - [laughing] What are you, a magpie? Shiny spoons, woo-hoo-hoo. [Little Witch laughing] Oh dear, help me. - At least a ladle's kind of practical. - I'd much prefer a woolen cap, thank you. - I wanna go inside now. - [Abraxas] What's the matter? - [Little Witch] Nothing. - You're upset about tonight's Walpurgis dance, aren't you? [light, solemn, twinkling music] You weren't invited to Brocken Mountain again this year and your feelings are hurt. Well you do realize that they have very strict rules. Walpurgis night is only for the big witches. At 127, you're still considered a little witch. - 127 years, two months, and 22 days. It's just not fair, I wanna dance on Brocken Mountain too. - They'll invite you some day I'm sure of it, be patient. - What if I just flew up there in secret? If they've already started dancing they wouldn't even notice me. [Abraxas clearing throat] [Little Witch laughing] - That's a horrible idea, what if they catch you? They may ban you, and you'll never go, and then what? - Do you think they would? [clock dinging] [clock clicking] [bird chirping] - Walpurgis night sounds like a lot of fun, if you have an invitation, that is. [sighing] I don't advise taking the risk. [bird chirping] [Little Witch sighing] Please be patient, there's always the possibility that you'll be invited to join next year, or the year after that. - [sighing] Be patient, but for how long? [deep, mysterious music] - [Thomas] Move it you [muffled]. - [Vroni] Thomas, wait up. - It's Walpurgis night you know. - Let the witches dance, they don't scare me. How can you tell if someone's a witch? - [Thomas] Well, they're really old and really ugly, and they just look wicked. - Have you ever seen a witch? - Of course not, and if I'm lucky, I'll never see one either. [tense music] [wind whipping] [gasping] [Abraxas snoring] [bed creaking] [Abraxas groaning] [Abraxas snoring] [clock dinging] [clock clicking] [bird chirping] - Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh. - [Abraxas] Rock candy. [light, mysterious music] [wind whipping] [bird flapping and cawing] [people yelling] [drums beating] [people yelling intensifies] [drum beating intensifies] - [Witches] We celebrate Walpurgis night, every witch's pure delight, many here shall be inspired, to spin around the witches' fire. Sing and dance and act all right, this is our Walpurgis night. [rapid drumming music] [adventurous music] [upbeat, rhythmic choral music] [drumming music] [crowd chanting] - Hello, Aunt Rumpumpel. - So you want to dance here with us, do you? - I'd love to. - You know, little witches like you are forbidden from coming here tonight under any circumstances. - Yes, I know, but if you don't tell, it can just be our secret. [drumming music] [people yelling] - It seems we have a visitor. - [Witch] Whoa. - Who? - Who is that? - It's my little niece. 287 times removed, that is. - I've never seen her. [witch farting loudly] [crowd groaning] - [sniffing] How old is she, anyway? - 127 years, two months, and 22 days. [witches gasping] - So young! - 127 years, you say? How dare you show your face here tonight. A witch of your young age is explicitly forbidden from dancing on Walpurgis night. - I'm sorry but, I was so curious, I just had to jump on my broom and fly over. [witches laughing] - She just had too. - Is she serious? - Hop on your broom and fly back home Little Witch before I get mean. - But I-- - No buts, and don't let me catch you here again. [people chattering] - And, what about next year, can I come back then? - What? - Hm, well if you work hard and become a good witch, then I'll consider it. - Really? - Perhaps. - Then I shall become a good witch, I promise. - It will never work, just take one look at her. - She's far too thin, she smells far too good, uh? - How small she is, way too small. - And she's stupid as well. - [Little Witch] I'm not stupid, I'll be as good a witch as any of you. - Whoa! - We shall see about that! In one year, on the night before Walpurgis, I shall assemble a council of witches, and we will put you to the test. - Um. - Um-hm. - We will then find out if you have what it takes to be a truly great witch, you agree? - [Little Witch] Mm-hm. - And if you should fail, well, you'll be banned from celebrating Walpurgis night forever. - Yes, yes. - [Head Witch] The book. [slow, solemn music] - What's this? - Hm, in this book, all the things good witches know awaits. - [Witch] Mm-hm. - One year from now, you must show flawless mastery of every last spell therein, if you wish to pass. [chuckling] Do you understand? - Yeah, sure do, I'll start studying tomorrow. [laughing] I'll be a good witch, I know I will. [witches laughing] I'll show you. - Not so fast, a moment please. Will she not be punished for this violation? - We all know the rules, anyone who comes to the witches' dance without an invitation must be punished, that is true. - Give her to me, I'll bury her up to her neck in mud. [witches laughing] - Let's make her lie in a bed of coals for three days and three nights. - Quiet! Such venom and ire. So, what should we say? - Yes, I would suggest that we take away her witches broom. That means she'll be forced to walk three days and nights step by step by torturous step just to get home. [witches chattering] - Very good, that's what we'll say. - [Rumpumpel] Give me your broom. - But. [swooshing] [fire roaring] - Be gone, boo! [witches laughing] - I'd keep an eye on her through this, she still has much to learn. [drumming music] [witches laughing and yelling] [Little Witch groaning] [light, bouncy choral music] [Little Witch groaning] [light, bouncy choral music] - Oh, can't forget the book, come on. [adventurous music] [Little Witch groaning] - [Abraxas] Come on, where have you been? What happened to you, where's your broom? - The sparks were flying, and the drums were banging so loud and the witches were dancing like crazy. The bonfire was giant, Abraxas, oh I wish you could've seen it. - [Abraxas] Mm-hm. - I think I could've danced all night. - But they caught you instead. - Unfortunately, now I have to learn that whole book as punishment. - [Abraxas] That's not a punishment, it's the opportunity of a lifetime. - How is it an opportunity? 7,892 spells of memorization is good how? - It'll be hard work that's true, but if you want to be a great witch, it'll take sacrifice. - Yeah, so I'll work, every day for seven, eight hours at least. But first I'll get revenge, on Rumpumpel, that ugly old thing. - So, what's your plan? [Abraxas groaning] - I'm gonna give her a big fat pig snout. [laughing] Some horns. [both laughing] And a nice flowing goat's beard on her chin. [Little Witch laughing] And on her gigantic behind, a big horses tail. - None of this is true revenge. - Oh? - Since Rumpumpel is an older witch, she can dispel all these small charms without even batting her eye. If you really want to take revenge on old Rumpumpel, you must become a better witch than she. And you should begin right now. - [Little Witch] Like right now? - [Abraxas] Immediately. [book crashing] [Little Witch sighing] - Fundamentals of black witchcraft. First, the elements. [giggling] The spells on conjuring wind, I think I can handle that. Ventalas ventalas vantalus voontalus verivox, verifoox voorufex hexorex. Ventalas ventalas vantalus [sighing] voontul, vontafex? And then it's something like veritvex, verihex. [wind swooshing] [harp music] Ought-oh. - What's wrong? - Must've been the wrong spell. - Wrong spell, what do you mean? [crying out] Take them away, get rid of them now. - That spell is way too complex, and the wind doesn't need my help to blow anyhow. Invoke ball lightning, cause avalanches, release a firestorm, but what about dirty dishes? Or mending socks, something useful. - Can you please just get rid of these ears? - They look good on you. [laughing] Ears, ears, ah, ears, rabbits, counter-spell, conversio, that's it, mm-hm. Vari verihex. [wings flapping] [laughing] Why are you laughing? Oh dear. - I think they look good on you. [laughing] [both laughing] - Ventavus ventavus ventavus voontavos, uh, that's not right. Varibooks varivox. [sighing] These spells are too complicated and that book is too big. How am I suppose to get through it? What are you looking for, did you lose something? - [Gatherer] We're looking for firewood, but there's nothing on the ground, no branches, no twigs, nothing. - What do you mean, nothing? - [Gatherer] There's been no wind, and no wind means nothing's been falling from the trees. - [Gatherer] I'd love to know magic right now. - [Gatherer] Well you don't, and why, it won't help anything. - Ventavus ventavus vantuvus voontavus verivox verivoox ruafex hexarex. [wind whipping forcefully] - Take cover. - [Woman Running] Your handkerchief, I'll get it. [gasping] [yelling] [Little Witch laughing] - That's enough, stop it, enough. [birds chirping] - Ah, look. - Huh, I guess I can conjure. Wind's a good start. - Blunderbust, thunder tindrums, lead and hail, what are you doing? You know you can't collect firewood here. - How else are we suppose to heat our stoves? - That's not my problem, empty your baskets right now. Come on, let's go. - Please, Mr. Forester, show some mercy. We're not hurting anyone. - That is not the issue, there are rules. Now empty that basket. [light, bouncy music] - You should stay away from me. - So, you wanna resist, I oughta lock you up for obstructing an officer and, and, and I would be happy to let you keep however much wood you need. [gasping] Did I really just say that? - Thank you for being so agreeable, I just wish these baskets weren't so heavy. - Oh for goodness sake, I should take you in for whatever nonsense you're trying to pull here. But, first I should carry that heavy basket home for you. Why would I wanna do that? - You really mean it? - No, I mean, oh sure. - [groaning] Here you go. - [stammering] Blunderbus, thunder tindrums, lead and hail, and if you want, I can carry you if it's easier. - [Little Witch] [giggling] Really? - Definitely not, I mean, yeah. [groaning] - Giddy up [giggling] bye! Let's go little donkey, move it. [giggling] Come on little donkey, hurry, yah! - Bluderbust, thunder tindrums, lead and hail-- - Whoa, you can set me back down now. Hep! [gasping and groaning] Well that was nice, now run along home. [sighing] You must be the nicest forester in the world. - Uh-huh. - And you'll let the women gather wood in peace from now on? - Yes. - Hm, [giggling] he's not gonna forget that. [cat meowing] - [giggling] You should've seen him, all swearing and sweating. - It was good of you to help those poor women, but was it necessary to torture the forester like that, hm? - Yeah, of course. - But why? - Because it was fun, I help good people by punishing bad ones. - Is that so? Do you really think that's how a good witch behaves? Couldn't you do good without all the tricks and shenanigans? - That sounds boring. - Boring, well it doesn't have to be. [mice squeaking] [light piano music] [bouncy piano music] You know what, sometimes I get the feeling that you don't want to be a good witch. - Well, that's how I get to dance on Brocken Mountain, so of course I want that. - Then I think it's about time that you started acting like that's what you want, don't you agree? - How am I suppose to know what's good and what's not? - It's not something that you know, it's something that you feel. You have to listen to the voice deep inside yourself, you'll feel it. [light, bouncy music] [children yelling] - [Boy] Run, and take your girl drums with you. - Go play with your dolls. - [Boy] We don't want you little sissies. - [Boy] Thanks for our new cart. [boys laughing] Yeah! - [Boy] Let's break it. - Why are you doing that? - Because it's fun. - [Boy In Green Jacket] Yeah, it's a lot of fun. [boys laughing] Stop staring, and stop asking stupid questions. Cut it out, let's go. [boys laughing] [people chattering] [carnival music] - Thank you kindly, No-frills Jacob, now open. I've got fantastic [drown out by music and chatter] exquisite supplies for the gentlemen, and great, great lotions [drown out by music and chatter]. I'm feeling generous today folks, almost giving it away. Suspenders, razor blades, this big bottle of healthy garlic juice for dirt cheap. Step right up, I've got bargains you can't beat. That'll be five sir, thank you, you got yourself a bargain. The finest goods from No-frills Jacob, whatever you need. - How much for these? - For you my dear, just three, no, make it two, okay. Step right up people, you'll be glad you did. I've got flags, yarn, and ink. - [Little Witch] Thank you. - I hope they serve you well, ma'am. No-frills Jacob, open for business. I've got just what you need at the price you need. [light, bouncy music] [people chattering] - Hello there. - Hello. Mm! Anything else, ma'am? - [Mother] No thank you. - Mama, will you buy us a candy cane, or a rock candy please, just one? - [Mother] Not today Vroni, some other time dear. - That will be 8.70 please, thank you. [broom barrel crashing] - [Shopkeeper] Let me help you with that. - I need a broom, please. - A hand broom, a kitchen broom, or perhaps a birch broom? Maybe a scrubbing brush. I also have many feather dusters to choose from. - Just a simple birch broom. - Ah, with or without a broomstick. - With, I mean, the stick's the most crucial part. - Here you go, my finest quality broom. [broom clunking] - Very nice, oh, and a large bag of rock candy, please. [Little Witch giggling] A little more. Oh, and a candy cane. - Ah, mm, okay, that'll be 9.80, please. - Oh, keep the change, thank you. - Thank you. - Mm-hm. [twinkling] [man grunting] [people chattering] - Miss, handmade paper flower? Flowers, handmade paper flowers, flowers. - You have so many lovely flowers, I like them. - Yeah, I made them all myself but no one wants one. - May I? [inhaling] But their fragrance smells so good. - [Flower Seller] Their fragrance? - It smells sweet. - You're right. - What is that smell? - [Man] It smells magical. - Over there, I think it's those paper flowers. [happy orchestral music] [goat bleating] - One flower, please. - [Man] I want one too. - [Man] Two please, one for me and one for my sister. - [Man] I'll buy a couple! [bouncy, happy orchestral music] [goats bleating] - Notice something weird? - Yeah, she's not running out of flowers. - Hey, hey, excuse me, can you save me a flower? Your, your flowers are quite beautiful. [bouncy, happy orchestral music] [birds chirping] - Now, you're going to be my witch's broom, okay. [Little Witch singing happily] See, being good can be fun. Eh, why are you acting up? That was close. I'm guessing that one flips up over and I wonder what'll happen if I do this! [bouncy, happy music] Woo-hoo, woo! [sheep bleating] [upbeat, happy music] [Little Witch yelling joyfully] [upbeat, happy music] [water splashing] [laughing] Woo, now that's cold. [upbeat, happy music] [insects buzzing] - [Abraxas] Oh, I'm roasting out here. - [sighing] Ah, this is so boring. Should I cast some spells? - [Abraxas] On a Friday, on Friday, spells are-- - Forbidden, I know. Well what about an itty, bitty spell? - If you're willing to risk getting caught, then go right ahead, but we'll see if you dance on Brocken Mountain. - It's such a stupid rule, no magic on Fridays. I don't understand it, why not cast spells on a Friday? [light, mysterious music] [birds chirping] - I think we've been here before. - Okay, that way? [light, mysterious music] - Hm? - Oh, hey [yelling]. [water splashing] Oh dear. - [Thomas] No one's home. - Hello. Are you kids lost? - No. - Yeah. - Come on, I won't bite. How 'bout a bite to eat, I'll go see what I have. - It's her, that lady from the market. [dishes rattling] [door creaking] [light, mysterious music] - [Thomas] What's that? - It's a snouted, horned, horse-tailed goat witch. Whatda you think? - I don't know. - I kinda like it. - How about some cocoa and cake? Good? - [Both] Mm-hm. - [Thomas] Yeah. - Can I ask you something? - You can ask anything. - Are you a witch? - [Thomas] Vroni. - So, are you or not? - Uh, I'm sorry about that, she's not trying to be rude. Of course you're not a witch. - Oh no? - Obviously, you're not mean or ugly or old. And you can't cast spells either. [chair rumbling and creaking] Hey, I want down. - So you really are a witch then. - Will you please put me down? - What else can you do? [Abraxas clearing throat] - What would you like? - Are you mad, have you forgotten what day it is, well? - The bird can talk? - Is he an enchanted prince? - He's no prince, Abraxas is an old know it all who's scared to leave the house. - What's his deal? - Probably nothing, but don't you think it'd be nice if he closed the curtains. [Abraxas groaning] [curtains slamming] - Can I come down already? - Sure, sorry about that. - Ohh. [chair banging] [Thomas grunting] - Any requests? - Put the table on the ceiling. [table creaking and rattling] [glass shattering] - Don't mind that. - Fill the bathtub with milk and honey. [water gurgling] [upbeat, bouncy music] [giggling] - And what about you, is there something that you'd like to see? - Make the stove play a song. - I see, playtime. [horns music] [stove clanking] [giggling] [horns music] [clock ringing] [bird chirping] [horns music] [all laughing] [chaotic music] [singing nonsensically] [all laughing] [pounding at door] [Abraxas gasping] [gasping] Hello? [cat meowing] Who are you? [crying out] [Rumpumpel laughing] Rumpumpel, what a nice surprise. - I was nearby, so I thought I'd pop in. - That's nice, I'm kind of right in the middle of cleaning at the moment, so-- - I don't mind, just checking on how your studies are going. - Good, very good, actually. - [Rumpumpel] Good, good, very good indeed. [laughing] [light, bouncy, mischievous music] What's with the curtain and those shutters over there being drawn? - Oh it's because it's hot outside. - I see, the heat. [light, curious music] [liquid dripping] Eh! - Uh, well that makes it easier to clean. - Were you casting spells? - I'd never do such a thing on a Friday. You know spells are forbidden today, don't you? - Don't get cute with me. - Sorry. - [Rumpumpel] Do you have visitors right now? - [Little Witch] No. - You wouldn't happen to be entertaining humans? We witches are to keep away from humans, you know that's forbidden too, don't you? - [Little Witch] Of course, that's common knowledge. [Little Witch sighing] - What's that? - Um, I like to draw, it's relaxing. - Well, uh-uh, it's not bad. You have talent, hm. Honey? - Yep, it's good for the skin, you should try it sometime. - Why, is something wrong with my skin? Oh, you mean warts. - [Thomas] Achoo! - Is someone here? - No, that was, achoo, me. This time of year always gives me, achoo, terrible hay fever, it gets worse, achoo, each year. I just can't see to, achoo, shake it off. [giggling] [tense music] [Abraxas yelling] - Get that away, you'd better count your lucky stars it's Friday, or else I'd-- - Cut it out, Abraxas. - What did you call him, that charbroiled chicken there? - He's Abraxas, he's my raven. He gets in the way when I'm cleaning so I put him in the cupboard. - You know, that we true witches, our pets tend to be cats. - Uh, cats? - Yeah, meow, not caw, caw, caw. You should think about that. - Achoo! - Try some nettle tea with some boiled raven's feet perhaps. - No! - [Bumpumpel] That always works for me. - Thank you for the tip, I'll have to try it. - You should be sure to clean behind the sofa. There's so much dirt, you'd be surprised. - Yeah, okay, goodbye, Rumpumpel, it was nice to see you. - I'll keep an eye on you. [Abraxas grunting] Meow, kitty, kitty. [cat meowing] - Who was that? - [Little Witch] Okay, it's time for you to go home, it's getting late. - Did you do that? - Yes. - [Vroni] Thank you. - Yep, that's our secret. All right, off with you. Is something wrong? - We don't know the way. - Now don't worry about that, you two just follow your noses and it'll be just fine. - [Vroni] A real witch, and she's not wicked. - [Thomas] But the other one sure was. - Yeah, and so ugly. - Hello, are you lost, do you need me to take you home? [laughing] [cat meowing] - Oh, spells on Friday, even worse, in front of humans. What if you had been caught, huh? Imagine what Rumpumpel could've done to those children. Even you know it's extremely forbidden to cast spells in front of humans. - Those children. I didn't think about them. - [Abraxas] Because you only think about yourself. - Because you know what's best. - [Abraxas] You should be thankful, without me, everything would fall apart. - Oh yeah, well you should know that witches keep cats around, not bossy old ravens. [gasping and sighing] I'm sorry. - What are you trying to say? - Nothing, I have no idea what I'm saying. - [chuckling] And I'm a homebody, is that it? - A brilliant homebody. - It's true, I may be a wee bit out of practice, but I could fly if I wanted to. - If you wanted, you could fly. - Hm-hm, somebody does need to keep an eye on the house when you go out. - Of course. - Just a household tip, always clean behind the sofa. There's just so much dirt there, you'd be surprised. - And some nettle tea will work wonders for your hay fever, with boiled raven feet. - [shuddering] But not with mine. - It's a deal. [both laughing] [Little Witch grunting] [sighing] [light, bouncy choral music] [swishing] [giggling] [frog croaking] Oh! - [Abraxas] And up. Now give it a spin, yes, nice. [laughing] [Little Witch crying out] - Stretch 'em nice simply to keep up going to the clouds, three times. [voice drown out by music] [cat meowing] [somber music] Fly like a horse and stay the course. Forest and pluck into the right box. What does that mean? Rabbit's foot, apple tree, spider, rat, and hazel tea. Three, two-- Pocus hocus, the branch is dropping oh so fine. Hocus pocus, hot cross buns, all and everything is done. Oh, hot cross buns, all and everything is done. - [Abraxas] Wake up, wake up, yes you're going to love this! - It's snow! Abraxas, it's snowing! [uplifting music] [Little Witch yelling] [light, twinkling music] - Achoo! Achoo! [yawning] I think you should take a little break, you look exhausted. - [Little Witch] No time. - Well, a little fresh air never hurt anybody. - Look who's talking, I'm freezing. Let's see if I remember, ignes agnes igoonamite, fire set yourself alight. Well, that worked great. I think you're right, a little fresh air is just what I need. - [Abraxas] You've earned it. - Are you coming? - In this cold, I'm not a penguin, you know. - Hm, coward. - I am not being a coward, the world is quite a dangerous place for an old raven such as myself. I mean, birds of prey out there, and foxes. Not to mention the rain, wind, and snow. - Goodbye, see you later. - But I could still fly along, if I wanted to.

You can tell me, I promise I won't tattle. You didn't really steal his money, did you? - No, I didn't, but for the last year he's been playing nine pins at the tavern almost every night, and losing his money, and he always get mad and starts making up stuff that isn't true. - Like you stealing from him? Ever talk to him about it? - He gets mad every time you even try to talk to him. - Sounds like you both have a temper. You know, if talking doesn't help maybe we can try something else.

[cat meowing] [animal yelling] [Little Witch crashing] [Little Witch laughing] [sighing] [clunking] - Abraxas? ♪ For she's jolly good lady ♪ For she's a jolly good lady ♪ For she's a jolly good lady Oh, hi. ♪ For she's a jolly good lady ♪ For she's a jolly good lady ♪ For she's a jolly good lady ♪ That nobody can deny - [laughing] My birthday, I completely forgot about it. - [Abraxas] You've been wrapped up in your studies. - And there's 128 candles. - [Abraxas] Now you'll have to blow them out and make a wish. - [Little Witch] Do I have to? It's just so beautiful like this. - Yeah, you're right, it is quite lovely. [gentle music] - [Little Witch] Uh, I almost forgot. [gentle music] [giggling] - For me? - To keep you warm and cozy [giggling] better, perfect. [both laughing] [shuddering] [upbeat, happy music] Tomorrow's Walpurgis and I haven't heard from any of the big witches. - [Abraxas] Well, did you really learn every single spell in the book? - All 7,892. [pounding at door] Hello. [cat meowing] [gasping] - I scare you? [laughing] I am here by order of the head witch. Your test will take place tonight at midnight. Come to the witches' rock past the cave, you know where that is, don't you? - Yes, so tell the head witch I'll certainly be there. - You don't have to come if you'd rather not. [cat screeching] [Little Witch crying out] Sometimes it's wiser to simply remain at home. - But I really wanna dance on Brocken Mountain. - Don't say I didn't warn you. [bell tolling] [footsteps clomping] - Nine, 10, 11, 12. [sighing] Hello? - [Witch] Yes, who's there? - Me! - [Witch] Who is me? - Me, I've come here to take my witch's test tonight. [witches laughing] - [Witch] Now! [dramatic music] [head witch laughing] - She's still skin and bones. - And she hasn't grown an inch all year. - Excuse me. - So, you've decided to take the test, huh? To show us that you've become a capable witch. Ready for your first task? - [Little Witch] Yes, I am. - Here we go, conjure a whirlwind. - Whirlwind, whirlwind. Ventavus ventalus vantulas voontalus verifex verifoox vurufex hexerex. [dramatic music] [wind whipping] [witches yelling] - [Head Witch] I said stop. - Stop! [laughing] - [Witch] Was that necessary, why's it always my fire. - And not bad. - That was good. Do thunderclaps, three of them. - Thunderous thanerous thoreous, thornarix thinarix thanorum, thunder thaner thinerboom. [thunder clapping loudly] [witches crying out] [witch farting] - Oh, sorry. - Make the throne of the head witch fly up into the air. And make her hair burn. Make thick smoke pour out of her ears, and lightning shoot right out of her nose! - No, no, calm down, calm down. No fire or smoke, hear, I'm perfectly fine without it. [witches groaning and grumbling] Anyone else have a task for her? - Now cast the spell on page 3,574 from the Book of Witchcraft. - Uh, 3,574, that was uh, it says, that one is, I can see it, uh, ball lightning, ball lightning. - She's correct. - Ballight booloo spenaloose, Ballight bowloose lightaboose. [bouncy, twinkling music] [air gushing] [thunder clapping] [witches crying out] [exploding] [witches laughing] - [laughing] Very good. - So does that mean I can join the dance this year? - The dance? [laughing] [all laughing] Yes, you may. [witches yelling happily] - Thank you, wonderful witches! - Unless somebody has an objection to you joining our celebration. - Yes! - Hm? - I have an objection, and I can prove that she's not a decent witch. Notwithstanding this tomfoolery here, she's nothing but a farce, a very bad witch. I've been watching her for the last year, and I have a list of her crimes. First, she casts spells on Friday, tons. - Ohh. - Is this true? - Yes, but it was only on one Friday. - And secondly, she did so in front of human children. [witches gasping] - Oh. And these children, tell me, they no longer fear you? - Why would they fear me? - Don't you know people everywhere need to be afraid of us, it's very important. - Hm-mm. - And thirdly, this wretch chose to punish a naughty little boy by bewitching a snowman and bringing him to life. - Oh! - What's worse, she did it to help other children. - And I also helped the wood women, and I helped the girl at the market sell her paper flowers by giving them an irresistibly sweet smell, and Konrad wasn't really a naughty boy, he was just sad. - Oh-oh! [laughing] - Disgusting, why would you tell us all about what a bad witch you are? - Bad, but I only cast spells to do good things? [witches laughing] - Yes, exactly. Witches that cast wicked spells, they're the good witches. But you, on the other hand, are a bad witch, because you only see fit to cast good spells. - Well, I didn't know. - Unbelievable, you didn't know? - No. - A proper witch doesn't know this, she feels it deep within her bones. - But I did feel it in my bones. - You also feel like you deserve to dance on Brocken Mountain. [witches laughing] - I know what she deserves, we should make her collect the wood for the bonfire, all by herself. - And after dancing a few rounds, we can snatch this pretender up, and pull out all her hair, one strand at a time. [witches laughing] - Kind witches. - [All] We are not kind witches. - I mean you wicked witches, I can make up for it by being really, really wicked as well. - Oh yeah, then prove it to us. - Sure, so what do you want me to do first? - Oh, oh, mm, hm. - Have her turn those two human children into stone. - You have until midnight tomorrow to make it so. Either you do exactly as you're told or your magic power will be forever gone. - And once that happens, you will be banned for all time. - And you'll have to live like an ordinary girl, all by yourself. - It's time to decide. [tense music] - Is that really the only option? I'll collect all the firewood that you want, I'll gladly take the test next year, or the year after that. I'll juggle my broom. [wind howling] Where did you go? - They're really forcing you to do that? These poor children are innocent, you know you can't turn them to stone. - I can't, if I refuse they'll take away my magic. - Yes, it's just so unfair, I'll bet none of these stupid witches know the Book of Witchcraft as well as you do. They should be punished, by taking away their magic powers. My blood is just boiling over this, I'm so furious. - This is all your fault. - Excuse me? - You're the one who told me that I should be doing good deeds. - Now hold it right there, those good deeds were entirely your idea, were they not? - You always know what's best. - And you are a good witch who would never dream of doing bad things. - [Little Witch] And what if I don't wanna be a good witch. - [Abraxas] Nonsense, you shouldn't say such things. - Oh yeah, then tell me what you think I should do. - Uh, [sighing] I've no idea. - Really? Rumpumpel was right, what good's a raven? - What did you say? [door banging] [wind whipping] Do you mean that? As you wish. This isn't you. [wind whipping] [door banging shut] [light bouncy music] [bird chirping] [light, solemn music] [sheep bleating] [bell tolling] [sheep bleating] - [Children] Love your neighbors, you are one, keep your loved ones by your side. Witches' dance we need the moon, one more will be worried soon. [baby crying drowning out voices] Have been waiting for the rain. [muffled] for Walpurgis night. Gather neighbors far and wide, keep your loved ones by your side. Witches, [voices drown out by crashing and clunking]. - So you've come to turn those children into stone after all, eh? That's good, because if you don't, I will. I promise you. - [gasping] You scared me to death, you okay? - Something wrong? [somber music] - Veerum varum, veerum varum, veerum, vowum varum vixor, varum vixor. [sighing] I can't. - You can't do what? - The big witches want me to do wicked things. But I just can't. - That sounds like a good thing. - No, it's not good. - Can you cast a spell? - After tonight I can't use magic. - Do you not have a spell book? [tense music] - What're you doing? - [Little Witch] I'm drawing a circle around you to protect you from evil until Walpurgis is over, mm. - Seems you've made your decision. You will regret this. - What's your problem with the children? They didn't do anything to you so why should I hurt them? - Because you're desperate to prove that you're a proper witch. - But it's so wrong and evil. - It is, that's true, we're witches. - Well I'm a witch too. - Not for long. - We'll see about that. - Yes, your broom will burn nicely you'll see. At the big dance [laughing evilly]. - I am a proper witch, and I'm not gonna let anyone tell me that I'm not, you hear me old goat? Nobody else knows that book by heart. You'd all be powerless without your books. Without your books. [rapid, bouncy music] He said, I hope that they'll serve you well. [groaning and grunting] [bird singing] Quiet, I'm trying to concentrate here. [rapid, bouncy music] Yes, that's it. [bird singing] [light, bouncy music] [bird cawing] Abraxsus. Abraxas, I put out some raisins for you. I'm really sorry about what I said to you. I was confused and scared. But I'm not confused anymore. - Hm. - Please, watch the house while I'm gone, okay? I'm gonna go up to the mountain. [Abraxas gasping] Wish me luck. - Brocken Mountain? Don't go yet, I can help, wait for me. There's the raisins. [bird chattering] What did you say, she left the matches? [bird chattering] Yes, I'm aware that she never gets the fire spell right. [bird chattering] To Brocken Mountain, me? Well, I'm suppose to watch the house, so I can't, no, there's no way. [bell tolling] [deep, somber music] [Vroni gasping] [bell tolling] Oh dear. [swooshing] - Something is missing here. - Where is the firewood? This cannot be possible. - Wrong, it is very possible. [people chattering] - You foul fate, you dare to defy the order that we gave you. - Just how am I defying you? - You were suppose to turn the children into stone and you didn't do it. - Yes, yes. - And what about the firewood, the bonfire can't take place without firewood, remember. - [Little Witch] But the wood's there. - Is that some kind of joke, I see no wood around, nothing. - I think you should look again. Hocus pocus one, two, three, witches brooms come fly to me. Therum arum flip and flap, on this lofty mountain drop, fall upon this spooky place, build a roaring fire base. [crowd yelling and groaning] - My broom, no. [witches yelling] - What're you doing, are you a fool? - Hocus pocus hear me say, witches books be on your way. High past the roofs on my behest, please join me on this magic quest. [adventurous music] - Oh! [wind whipping] - My book! [witches yelling frantically] [laughing] - All right then, this is happening. [bird chirping] Well I will fly there, you just wait and see. I can do it, I can do it, here I go! [Abraxas yelling] [Abraxas crashing] That kinda hurt. [bird chirping] - [Witch] What's going on? - What on Earth does she want with our spell books? - Oh, that tiny girl must've gone crazy. - You wretch. [yelling] I'm gonna make you pay dearly for this. - Hocus pocus now hear as I say, take their witchcraft all away. Witches will bewitch no longer, none is weaker, none is stronger. Hocus pocus, blood and bone, witchcraft is for me alone. [Rumpumpel yelling] - Oh, hump pump, I can't remember. - Outta the way, neither can I. [laughing] [witches chattering frantically] - My power! - Oh, oh. - [gasping] So what do we do next? - You will reverse the spell, right now. - Sorry, I can't. - Why can't you? - Because I forgot it, I think it's on page 3,786. [grunting] - She forgot the spell? - So, I think it's time to start the bonfire now. - Oh no! - What? - [Witch] No, stop right there. - I really need those matches. [witches groaning] Ignus agnus igatrite, fire set yourself alight. - Huh? - Ignus agnus igatrite, or was it iganun? - [Witch] She forgot the bloody spell. [witch cackling] - Now what was that spell? - Well a spell book would come in pretty handy now, eh? [witch cackling] - I gotta think. - No, snuff out the torches. [witches chattering] We'll get you, you miserable, stupid little toad. - Uh yes, the toad, I remember. Bufo, bafo don't remain. - What are you doing? - But settle in the toad's domain. [groaning] [toad croaking] [witches laughing] Bufo bafo all of thee, now let your inner toad be free. [witches yelling] [toads croaking] [laughing] Sorry, careful, pardon. All right, time to light the fire, but how? [Rumpumpel moaning] - [Abraxas] I'm here, I made it, I made it. - Abraxas? - Look at me, ought-oh. - Abraxas? [Abraxas crashing] Abraxas, are you all right? Oh no. [Abraxas moaning] - You completely forgot the matches. You forgot to bring the matches, you've never had any luck starting a fire without them. - But it's been over a hundred years since you've flown. - I might be a homebody, I can't pretend I'm not. But this was the right occasion. - Oh Abraxas, my dear, sweet Abraxas. Will you please forgive me for what I said? - Yes, of course I will, but I can't forgive you if I can't breathe, please let me go. I'm not joking, need air. - I'm sorry. [solemn music] - [Abraxas] What is she up to? - [Little Witch] Rumpumpel, what are you doing? - Oh, who me, nothing. Please don't do anything rash, you and I could be friends, don't you think? I mean, I've never actually had a girlfriend, but I don't know why you and I couldn't start that. I always liked you, you know, and just because someone accidentally casts a couple of good spells doesn't mean she has to lose her magic, does it? [laughing] - What're we gonna do here? - I believe we've had this discussion before. [laughing] - You mean? - I do, pig snout, horns, and horses' tails go witch. [Abraxas and Little Witch laughing] - Pebble scum, bubble gum, an exotic beast you will become. [creaking and stretching] [Rumpumpel bleating, snorting, and grunting] [Abraxas and Little Witch laughing] Boo! [Rumpumpel screeching] [toads croaking] [wind howling] [gentle music] - It's quite lovely. - All we need is music. - Music? - Yeah, it's time we dance now. - What do you mean, we? - Well, the two of us. - Oh goodness. - Bullyton bullyton, donkey's ear, all you instruments will appear to lend a hand in this wonderful night, to dance a splendid dance tonight. [wind blowing] [Vroni sighing] [gentle music] - Thomas, come look, you've gotta see this. [Thomas gasping] [slow, solemn music] [upbeat music] ♪ We celebrate a Walpurgis night ♪ ♪ Rejoice without the witches' fright ♪ ♪ Up and down and all around ♪ No bad witches can be found ♪ Celebrate Walpurgis night ♪ And sing and dance, we're here till light ♪ ♪ Up and down and all around ♪ No bad witches can be found [Little Witch laughing] - Walpurgis! [Little Witch and Abraxas laughing] - Walpurgis. [upbeat bouncy music] Say it, Walpurgis. - [Little Witch] Say it again, Walpurgis. [jazzy piano music] [Abraxas muffled by piano music] Woo, my first Walpurgis! [jazzy, upbeat piano music] [stove vocalizing] [Abraxas laughing] - [Little Witch] Woo-woo! - Hey, Walpurgis! [bird chirping] [dramatic orchestral music] - I'm at Walpurgis! - [Abraxas] Walpurgis! Walpurgis. [Abraxas laughing] [upbeat choral music] [thunder clapping] [Little Witch and Abraxas laughing] - [Little Witch] You're taking up knitting? - I don't understand it, I'm just trying to conjure some rain, it shouldn't be this hard. Hocus pocus, egg of toad, to me white cloud now quickly float, draw together, open up. Possum, pussum, fill our cup. [thunder clapping] [raisins splattering] [Abraxas and Little Witch laughing] - Of course, you don't mind raisins. - Well, I might've made a small mistake. - [Little Witch] How 'bout if we leave the spell casting to me? - [Abraxas] You are the witch. - And you are my dear sweet Abraxas. [laughing] [uplifting music] [thunder clapping] - Thunder?
