"In our cycle, The provinces are dying, here's today, Loubressac, village in peril. Loubressac, in the Dordogne valley is the typical example of those villages of the French provinces that the rural population is deserting bit by bit and condemning to a sure death." Mr Michalon, you are grocer and tobacco seller in Loubressac. How do you see the future? Without highway between Souillac and Saint-Cere, there will be no tourism. The highway means tourism! Tourism is the only solution. I do the best plums in the area. And nothing! I don't sell anything! My wife is born here. I come from the city. We wanted to be quiet, but not at this point! The young are leaving, the old are dying. That's the end. No one comes anymore. What we need, it's tourists. But, Mister, what would it change? Well, everything! ...And so, they came! Shut up! You have some visitors. Is it? A circus or something. Tourists! Not the kind we want. They're broke. Broke? A motorbike like this cost a lot. For sure. God bless you. It's maybe stolen. Arsene, make them leave. It's a common land. - Me? - You're the deputy mayor. They're maybe thieves and assassins. You're the deputy. It's not a common land, it belongs to Adrien. It's up to him. God bless you. God bless you, Mr Peloux. Allergic to children? If only they could stop singing! Wait. Thanks... Thanks. Hippies on my land? That would be a bit rich! They're capable of anything. What if they start growing hashish? - Growing what? - Hashish? They settle and make their own little patch. I read it in the press. Is that so? Is it growing easily? Pardon me? Nothing grow over there. I tried wheat, corn and beetroot. Does hashish pays well? 5 years in prison. I'm gonna kick them out! The what? The money. 500 Frs. You bent my grass. You've nothing else in mind. My grass? Your money. A hippy only thinks about flowers, love and non-violence. That's your slogan, isn't it? "Make love, not war." Yes. And what if I punch you in the face? What? Then it means you're not a real hippy. No. It means you're a real asshole. We're leaving since it's private. Wait! It's up to you not to pay. But apologize to the teacher, he has nothing to do with it. My ass! That's enough! Don't fight in front of the kids. It's no example to give. Paul! Leave it... They despise us. Drug, sex and violence are the defects of youth. God bless you. You stay. Why would I stay? You're the deputy. Be sure they leave. What a joke... He's right. Honors are creating obligations. And sometimes risks. Thanks... Thanks. Animals, I tell you. I read in the paper, that in Copenhagen, Denmark, to make some money... they had sex on a motorbike in public. On a motorbike? Stationary. The girl hooked on the handlebars... And that's it! They collected money after. Animals. I never saw animals collecting money after. Neither do I! - That's the Kawasaki. - The what? The big motorbike, the Kawa 750. It's probably them. It's them! - Awesome, isn't it? - Yes. - You weren't afraid? - Not at all. On a motorbike... - Bye. - Goodbye, thanks! You have a strange way to enforce the law. A motorbike ride, an heart-rending farewell. A furtive kiss. You lack rigor in your duties. Stop it. Come on, what happened? They're leaving. That's all. I made them leave, as I've been told. I hope they're not gonna come back. I already kicked Romanians out, they never came back. Good riddance! No hippies on the common land! We're not in Katmandu here! - Bravo! - Luckily! It's maybe too bad. There's tourists in Katmandu. Hi. Do you have mineral water? I need 12 glass bottles, no plastic. Didn't you leave? We did, but not far. We found a wild area, with flowers and stuff. Very close from here. It won't bother anyone, that's for sure. Don't you give me my water? Sure. Do you have brown rice? What kind of rice? Brown. No, we don't have brown rice, only white. Is that so. Okay, then give me pasta. How many packets? Six packets. Three... and three, six. No green pasta? No, only normal pasta, normal sugar, normal rice. It's maybe abnormal, but we only serve normal people. I wasn't meaning to upset you. We don't trust unnatural stuff, pasteurized, all this. It makes people aggressive. Is it? Give me your list, it will be more simple. I'll give you what I have. But I'll deliver the food myself. We're not that abnormal! All right? Yes! Green pasta, brown rice! If you eat in color, you're not aggressive. - You should try. - Go ahead, laugh! They came back, like bad weed! If they're on the common land, I'll kick them out. After my delivery. They won't pay you! Sure they gonna pay! Let's check it out. I understood they're in the Causse, between the castle and Montvalent's rocks. - What's that? - Martians! They won't bend the grass, there's only rocks. But they belong to someone. - The Countess? - Yes. She's gonna kick them out. You're gonna lose your clients. They first have to pay. And to finish, the dry apricots. They're gonna ask to have it put on the slate. Are you paying by cheque or do you want to open a slate? Charles! Can you give me the dough? Here. Everything is increasing. - Beautiful, isn't it? - It looks comfortable. Want to visit? You're sure we're not bothering you? That's the Eskimo's igloo system. Eskimos have a very liberated lifestyle. You're all sleeping in there? Yes, here and over there. They sleep... Happy civilizations without war are living under the geodesic architecture. A geode is a mineral mass, spherical and hollow. - Ah... - Exactly! Just look at the Eskimos, at the Hopi indians, the African tribes, the Asian nomads. And now, us. This way. - Of course... viewed from this angle. Hi. - It's really incredible! - It is. Stop the engine, it's noisy! Do you plan to stay for long? Dunno. As long as we'll feel well here. Why? Is it bothering you? No. Is there a problem? The land. You are on the Countess' land. I can't believe it. There's nothing here, just a desert. It belongs to nobody. In France, everything belongs to someone. We don't mean to be unpleasant. You'll think we don't like Americans. But you'd prefer if we hit the road to avoid the fuss. We have no objection if you stay here. But the Countess won't agree. We can still ask her. Don't even think about it with your odd appearance and long hair. She even kicked the German out during the war. And they had short hair. We'd like to speak with the Countess. I'm not from the house. Go ask over there. Thanks. Anybody home? Can I help you? We would like to camp. I mean we'd like to ask the Countess the permission to camp on her land. Follow me but I don't think she'll see you. She's with a... - Bastard! Crook! With a lawyer. Shit! I said no and I meant no! Mr Lorain will be disappointed. And so? He's renting the main building for his own use and want to use this one for his business. Is it? He has big plans. And me, where should I go, then? To the Salvation Army? What is this?... Martin! This two gentlemen would like to camp in the Causse. Campers! How horrible! First two campers then 20 and you end up with an holiday camp! I have to go back to Paris. All right! Martin, tell them to piss off. I'm sorry. What those big projects are meaning? He didn't come since five years. - Precisely, he's coming tomorrow. - Tomorrow... If you could air the rooms and put back things in order. He's gonna have some people from the smart set. Oh really? From the smart set? He wants to see people, he's gonna see people. How many are you? - 11. Only? Do you have friends? - Yes. I'd be glad if they come and meet you. If we stay, we'll soon be plenty. Is it... Promise me something, Madame. To come. - Is it! The castle is open for you. Anytime you want. I love having friends. She said yes. Honest-to-God! When nobility allies with anarchy, that's the end of the State. If the nobility let them in, don't turn your nose up. What do you drink? - A mint cordial. - Me too. What would you drink, teacher? A martini with ice. - Not a double? - A double? - Me, a perroquet. - A perroquet. I've always say so. There's no generation problem! Bravo! My grandfather was drinking, my father was drinking... And me too. Come on, the last one! - It's for me! - No, leave it! Mr Peloux, my father, he wasn't drinking. He fall into a well when he was 5. I've always been for peace! The next day, we found Martin's body. You found him at 8 a.m.? I wouldn't say I found him. I saw something hanged. Without checking if that something was alive? There? Failure to render assistance... Failure...? Hey, I'm not an mountaineer! Poor Martin. I don't understand, he had no enemies. No tracks of blood, superintendent. Nowhere. Neither on the cliff, nor near the body. That means he wasn't killed there. I started seeing the witnesses. A nice bunch of hillbillies! I'll call you back, superintendent. Be quiet, over there. Let's get back on track. Name : Cahuzac. Peasant and gravedigger. Farmer and gravedigger! And deputy mayor. That night, you got drunk, with your friends. Drunk! We just took a couple of drinks! Doesn't sound like a very good alibi to me. How old is your alcohol license? 1965. Why? I don't see the connection. We're gonna send you the tax officers to have a look at your incomes and bookkeeping. That's unfair. I don't look like a tax evader. That's a shame! He wasn't kill by a guy from the village. We already have rural depopulation, if we'd start killing, there will be no one left. Nothing ever happen here. Sometimes, a fairground guy steals a chicken. That's it, fairground people. Or nomads... People who are just passing through. People from outside the village. Any fairground people around? Fairground people? No. But there's the youngsters camping just nearby. Very nice people. The girls are walking naked. They even sleep all together. - They're dirty and have long hair! - Long hair!? Let's go. Did you see his big nose? He must have some flair. That's good for truffes. We broke the back of the work for him. We didn't mince our words. That's normal. One must help the police. And so we did. We're not gonna take the blame for those rascals. They're not gonna camp for long. Soon, they'll have solid walls. And a flat ceiling. You know what you are? How dare you? They're probably innocents. You bunch of bastards! That's it, I'm off. We just did our duty as citizens. And so speak the scumbags. They're risking detention on suspicion for nothing. Why would they kill Martin? - Even more since... - Since what? Cool it, I know where Martin's been killed, he was covered with mud. And so? I recognized the earth from the cemetery. - Are you sure? - I'm digging there. And what would it change? What would the hippies do there? We can expect anything from them! They bent my grass. What about having a look? Yes... - I won't go there. - Why would we go? To fix your misbehavior. Come on... I won't go there, anyway. Look for freshly turned earth. If he died here, I could had chose a funnier place. He didn't choose it. Come on. Come on! Look at this. What do you think? That's what I was saying, Martin has been dragged here. Let's follow the tracks. Did you see where it leads? To the castle's mausoleum. It shouldn't be open. I have the only key. What about going back home? Shit, the vault is open! Do we have to get in this? All right, I'm going... Can you give me some light, Arsene? - Yes. Did you hear anything? Shit! Hey up there, the light! Are you okay, Paul? I slipped and fall down. Wait, I'm coming. Blood. - Where? - Here. It's maybe only moisture. I'm telling you it's dried blood. You're right, there's more here. - What's happening? - Blood. Gimme the light; I want to see on what I slipped. Here we are. I found. - What? Isn't it Martin's light? Yeah. - You were right. - Yeah. Shit! Jesus Christ... The Count. Is everything all right? Yes... Did you hear that? I heard. There's too many things happening. I want to go home. What about going back home? - Okay. - Hush! Be quiet, for Christ's sake! The police! Certainly not. The dead aren't respected anymore. The coffins have been opened and searched. Let's go! We must find a way to give Martin's light to the police. - By Mr Peloux. - Why me? Now you are an informer... with information. Come on, let's go. Yesterday, the other onlooker... Tonight, them. They never sleep in the country. Didn't we let the door open? Let's go! Julien! Julien? - Here I come! Hi. Fill it up, please. Hello. The cops went to see you? Yes. Where should we go to be left alone? Things will sort out. Goodbye, honey. Are you leaving? I go pick up the tenant of the castle. This one. Julien wanted to come, but there was too many customers. Too many customers at the cafй? How's that? Is the village repopulating? People from around are a bit curious. 'Cause of the murder. The murder? What murder? It's great to see you after all that time. 5 years! That's true. A reunion is always touching. - Not in school, today? - No. - God bless you. - Don't mind that. He's allergic to children. He's on a sick leave. Children make him sneeze. Ah! Arsene ! How are you? Getting old. So, what's new? My boys, here he is! How are you? - Hello. Do you recognize me? You bet! Old chap. You're even more beautiful. Life musn't be anoying with you. For the prodigal son, I put a bottle of Champ on the fridge. - Good idea. - Mr Peloux! Ah, Champagne! Did you make a fortune? Otherwise, how to rent the castle for the last 5 years without going there? Quick! The glasses! Actually we don't want to know if he made a fortune, we just want to know how. Here's the coffee break. He's always hanging in bars. Gйrard always had an odious side. I got fed up of skyscrapers. I felt like going back home. So I sold all my shares. Oil wells, casino in Vegas, hotel in Acapulco. I gave my apartment to my mistress. The car to the driver. I jumped on the first plane and here I am. - You left everything? - I was fed up. Now, I'll only do what I want. And what I wanted is to see the mugs of my friends. Since I left, I regret the green. There's none in America? Not as green as here. Because of the black problem. What's that? The hippies. You've not been told? No, but I would have appreciate that someone did. That's my field. I want to see the person in charge. In charge? I want to see the person in charge! What's being in charge? Are you in charge? In charge? In charge? And you, are you in charge? I'd like to know who he is. I own this land. I want to speak to the one who take the decisions. So, you're the Countess? What about putting back the music? I turned the music off because the party is over. You have 5 minutes to leave! - Did you buy the land? - I'm renting it. Fuck the Countess. She doesn't decide for what's mine. Would you camp at the Elysйe if she tell you to do it? Maybe. Okay, we're leaving. But first, show us your rental agreement. You don't believe me! I'll kick your ass until you do! Charles, is something wrong? You have 5 minutes to beat it! Is that a threat? An advice. Out! If we're speaking threat, you have a day to hit the road or I'll come back with a gun. I'm leaving so you don't delay your departure for me. You do that! This guy has very bad vibes. They're crazy, they all speak at the same time. - What they said? - They threatened me. I claim for what I own and I end up surrounded by junkies. They don't know me. I won't let them do. Come in. My respects, Countess. Would you be kind enough to give me my keys? Mr Lorain, I strictly followed your instructions. Everything has been done. Aired, cleaned, radiator bled, meter open, fridge working. The keys are on the door, goodbye. - Pleasant as always. - Try to understand her. Martin's death disrupted everything. He really chose the right moment. Of course... Here. Antoinette will do the cleaning. We'll see, Julien. Be nice enough to open upstairs. That bitch didn't aired anything. Okay. Gйrard Lorain? Did I scarred you? What are you doing here? Cool it, I came to see how things were going. The police system is working fine, you know. It's considerate, it worries for the smallest reasons. Do you have a warrant? A warrant is for a search. Not for a friendly visit. And we came as friends. You're just out of the pen and there's already a murder. And you arrive around just at that moment. Is it my fault if there's killing in the counties? He was a bit like your employee. He was watching your property. That's poacher stories. I've nothing to do with that. You should know I've spent three nights partying. With ladies. 5 years in your sanatorium, it leaves plenty of time to dream. I still have their addresses, you can check. We already did. Then what do you want!? Hey... What do you think of that? Smith & Wesson. 38 police special. Are you afraid of thieves? You're lucky. Martin has been killed with a Cobra. Admit that a Colt Cobra is not for poaching. - Of course. - Let's split. Next time... avoid to have this kind of toys with you. Just in case we come back with a search warrant. By the way, why rent a big place like this for nothing during five years? With your week-ends spent in the pen, wasn't it wasted? It was forestalling. With the housing crisis... Okay! I won't ask more stupid questions. But if you want to keep your castle, you better watch your step. See you soon. Hey... You've a friend listening at the doors. I understand why you were regretting the green. Mister! Julien! What? We need a doctor! Right now! Something bad? No, but Emmanuelle is delivering now. Oh, shit! Things aren't doing well. Hello? Hello? They even sleep at night! Paul! The girls' delivering and the doctor is on leave. I'm coming. His wife is a nurse. - But we need a doctor! - There's none! They're all far. The closest one is in Brive. No time. In this case... Come. Odette is coming. Do I get you something, Julien? Thanks. I'll bring you a jacket. He likes cars. You bet he does! He won stock-car races all over France. And also abroad. That's the rally inferno. He lost. Well... Good evening. Okay, come on. Everybody out. Don't stay here. Everybody out. Come on, out. You stay to help, and you too. Come on, out. You too. You too, please. Be nice, don't stay here. And you, go away! Give me my bag, please. You have to stop smoking. If you could air the place, it would be nice. I'll give you an injection, you'll feel better after. Here. Thanks. Charles, what is he doing? He's the father. He's praying. - Is he a protestant? - No. A Buddhist. Ah... Buddhist... That's it! It worked fine. It's a little girl. - How are you gonna call her? - Mana. - Mana... - The substance of psychic persons. In the Celtic religion. They're nice, but a bit weird. She wanted to deliver on her knees. - And so? I was scared to death. Luckily the ways of nature are wonderful. You still gave her a little help, aren't you? Anyway, they believe you've done everything. Ask them what you want. A birth is beautiful. - Hello. - Hi. Want some coffee? I won't say no. Mum, give him a bowl. What's up? You're up early. It's you. You get up when we go to sleep. I'm up when I have to. I have to prepare Martin's tomb. Shit, the funeral. We'll never sleep, huh? How quick it is to pass from a birth to a funeral. Mana? Yeah. That's the substance of the psychic persons. - Wow... - In the Celtic religion. - They want you as godfather? - Yeah. Why they didn't give her a normal name? Come on, they can give any name they like! Let me remind you the terms of the renting contract. It says: "The castle and the land." It's written in black and white. It's not the moment to speak about this. And in return, let me remind you it's about farmable land. The Causse isn't. That's my own business, not yours. I plan to grow carrots there. Leave me alone. I'd like to collect myself. For a servant? I'm gonna cry. There's servants more worthy than some social climbers of my knowledge. Well said! You better keep quiet! You're taking the dough of some social climbers too! How much do that bunch of hobos is giving you? What do you say? The beatniks you authorized to stay on my land, only to bother me. Don't you like youth? Come on! Give way! Let me warn you: I'll claim my rights. For once, law is on my side. I like the "for once". I'm gonna send a bailiff on the back! The last time a bailiff came was in 1947. He was found dead near the wood. Gйrard! My ducky! My love! Looks like some acquaintance are waiting for you. We're here! Come, sugar! It's us! We came to surprise you! - Are you happy? - Two weeks of partying. The nice suit! What's the matter, kitty-cat? Are you sulking? - Don't you kiss me? - And me? No, he's not angry! Hey, rednecks, what are you staring at? How's the little family? The mother and the child are fine. Thanks again. Could you get some sleep? Two hours, after the funeral. I had no time to eat. And now, I have a delivery at the castle. It's a mess since a few days. I came to invite you tonight. We're having a party to thanks you for your kindness. Thanks, but we had no time to recover. Three days ago, we celebrated the "yes" from the Countess. The day before yesterday, the cemetery. I can't explain you, but It was something too. Yesterday, little Mana. And this morning, it was Martin's funeral. Could you change the day for your party? Don't you think we're partying too much? Then I'll invite everyone for lunch tomorrow. Gйrard too? I come with you. I'm gonna talk to this guy. There must be a way to sort this out. Does he wants the authorization to camp? If it's his way in, I'm out of here. That wouldn't be very diplomatic. He came to negotiate. I'm coming. He's showing off, but he has some good sense. You came to apologize? Poor bastard! Get lost or I bust your ass! Call that a clout! That's not gonna sort things out. He's so handsome! Too bad he's leaving. He shouldn't had come... Sorry. Coca, that was about time, there's nothing in this house! Who's your friend? - A neighbor. - I think he's great. Not you? Not bad. - Are you expecting someone? - No, why? That's only for the three of you? The country stimulates the appetite. So was saying my father! "You've a big appetite, but a small brain." I don't know if he had a bigger brain, anyway, he died run over by a bus! Is your friend living far away? No, he's camping close by. A camper! What a shame. You know, you're not bad either. That's true, you have nice breasts. I mean not... And beautiful eyes, and stuff... Are you courting me or something? That's not how we call it where I come from. But if you want to have a walk in the country... The country? In the country... Bye. He's suffering, poor darling. My cutie! Did he hurt you? Hurt me? I'm gonna make that jerk swallow his hair. And so? Hurry up! Anybody there? Anybody there? Why would I be diplomatic with that freak? He's spiteful. He's not gonna forget that clout. I don't care, I won't let that hysteric bug me. I had enough with the cops this morning. The cops? They came back this morning, after Mana's birth. They searched everywhere and interrogated us. Even the baby. How dumb they must be. They even rolled up our sleeves to see if we are on drug. And so? - You want to check? - No, of course. They said we're gonna be in trouble. Alain thinks we've been fingered. Come on... Filthy pigs, they say it's a stranger who killed Martin. For them, it can be only us. Bullshit! I know where to find other strangers. In the castle. I kept myself busy while you were talking with Gйrard. There's someone hiding in the castle. And I bet he doesn't have a clear conscience. The key of the mystery is there. Okay, let's get there to have a look. Are you out of your mind? I didn't say it for that! I was just trying to be a smart ass. You would let innocent people taking the blame? - We don't give a damn! - I didn't say that either. - He never said that! - Shut up! Be careful... Shut up! We've been lucky last time at the cemetery. Julien knows the castle pretty well. Let's go all together. Not me! Seriously? - No! - Yes! Nothing is impossible to a valiant heart. That's a strategy matter. Do you need us this afternoon? - No, I go sign in. - At the unemployment office? At the police station. - Can we go if you don't need us? - Have our afternoon off. What for? Icing another gardener or visiting a cemetery? - You said it was forgotten. - You promised. Are you gonna trot this out again? It's okay, but you better keep quiet. Don't worry. We're just gonna have a paddle. A small dip. Here, the castle. Here, the house of the Countess. Here, the Dordogne. Very funny. That won't take us very far. Once Gйrard gone, there's still the two girls. I'll handle that. Adrien, that's the kind of foolishness that made me quit teaching. Oh, excuse me. Where was I? Yes! In the meanwhile... Hold on, I'm lost. Of course, you're not listening. While I'm taking care of the girls, Charles and you, you sneak into the castle. Adrien, you stay in the middle of the road with the tractor. If anyone comes, you block him. And you horn to let me know. Me, I'll tell Julien. I won't risk the life of my tractor! Come on... A tractor isn't a toy, it's a working tool. But... He's brand new. I'm not even finish paying for him. I don't want that tractor to be hurt. A tractor is a tractor! Understood. Of course! We'll do without it. But Paul went to Brive with the taxi. There's Julien's 2 CV. It has broken down. I won't lend my tractor. I lend you my motorbike. I won't lend my tractor. It's personal. Don't bear a grudge at me, but it's personal. Here's a redneck. He looks rather funny. Good day, ladies. I saw the castle was open. It's quite an event. I thought it would be good to come and pay you my respects. Would you drink something? With pleasure. The road made me thirsty. That's all my life... the thirst of knowing people, things, far away countries. And I should add beautiful women. Oh, thank you! If we find someone, what do we say? Oh Gods! Oh shepherds! Oh rocks! Lecherous old men, grouchy terms... Lining up old yews! Ponds, arbors! You're a poet, that's terrific! Jules Renard, Marcel Pagnol and more used to know how to add to the care of stupid children the cult of the poetic muse. Aren't you feeling too hot? You'd feel better without that. - It's embarrassing... What's inside? A corridor, but we're not gonna get in... Come on! I like today's youth, it immediately makes you feel comfortable. The naristys, the first mistresses, The golden hair, the azure in the eyes... Then, among the smell of the young and dear bodies, The timid spontaneity of caresses. Fishy, fishy, fishy... Are the fish biting? No, and for you? No. Fishing is relaxing. Hurry up, we have to go back. Did Martin was killed with that? No, the inspector said it was with a Colt Cobra. - We must find it. - Of course. Wow... We shouldn't had come. Each of them took off, to feel comfortable, the amber smelling flower. The youngest one arches her back and her sister, hands on her breasts, kisses her. And so, everything's fine? Why are you here? - To see. - What? If everything's fine. If not for my tractor, I would had help you. But it's like a toothbrush, it's personal. The jealous embrace... And the obsessive spasm... Can't equal a long kiss... What a dirty old man... I got it. A Colt Cobra. Wow... A tractor like this... Shit, someone is coming! Block the road and horn to warn them. Redneck! Farmer! Mr Peloux! Peloux! Peloux! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Slowly. I'm here. I'll teach you a lesson you won't forget! You've got your victory! Peloux... Not so good, your toothbrush. I'd like to be a little dog! The two little bones! How handsome he is! A sugar? What a beautiful bone! We're screwed. Gentlemen. No! No! Yes! Yes! Come in, gentlemen. My respects, Countess. Would you care for a cup of tea? Gladly. Get down to the village and compensate them for the tractor. - What? - I don't want any trouble! We can't do that! Yes, you can. And you'll apologize too. We can say we apologized and not do it. Just have a drink at the bar. Asshole! They're crazy! They refused to give way! I'll teach him a lesson. - A guy from the village. - If we have to apologize... Are you insane? What about the stop? Hillbilly! Dickhead! Redneck! Cuckold! Fasten your seat-belt. Mommy! Daddy! Mommy! Excuse us. "Excuse us... Excuse us..." They're gonna swallow their apologies. Does Cobra spell with "au" or with an "o"? Julien... That's not a very common word. - "o", as in "Colt"... - Is that so? Give me a T for tractor. Wait... Anyone has a T for tractor? There's no T... Give me a T instead of reading. - Who is it? - It's me. Here he is! - Are you alone? - Yes. Lock the door. Pour yourself some booze. We're working. - Can you cut out my T? - Just a second. You're doing some cutting? A letter. And we'll let you handle it. Bring it in town. It's almost done. "Superintendent"? An anonymous letter! That's the protection of the individual freedoms. Honest people are fighting with honest ways. I have a good news. We're leaving. As soon as the cops let us go. You're not that hurry. There's no rush. First, you didn't want us to stay, now, you don't want us to leave. At first, we had a small clash, but now... Your troubles are over. The cops won't bother you anymore. They're investigating at the castle. They're there. We passed them on the way. Who told them it was over there? Dunno. With the cops, you can never know. So, are you staying? What is it to you? Nothing never happens here. In the country, you just bore stiff. So you... Us, what? Before, there was a circus coming. It was like holidays when it was here. And when it was leaving, we were sad. Without offending you, it's a bit the same. If you stay, I'll have a jukebox and some pinballs coming and I set up a nightclub! We'll have motorbike rides. The area is great. I'll teach Nana how to read. What will we do after we'd sell you a couple of pelt jacket? If you can't manage to keep your own youth. It's already improving! You have the blue sky, the fresh air, just as you wanted. The little birds, you have them. Now, we can guarantee you a blissful peace. You maybe spoke too soon. Hands up! I'm in a hurry, the cops are tailing me. Stand still, I just have something to pick up. It's here. Dig quickly. What are you looking for? Some family jewels. Really? Your mother was a gatewoman. Shut up. I just get back what's mine. I've no time to wait for those suckers to leave. Why are the cops tailing you? Ask these two morons. Are you digging, God damnit? I'm fed up of this country, I get away. Everyone keeps leaving. End of the line. We're there. Give way. Thank you, Saint-Anthony. Thank you, Gйrard. Give him the box. Are you out of your mind? We're the ones who have been digging! That jerk asked for it. Crooks! Thieves! Ruffians! - Your car keys! - No! Okay. Gйrard, don't do anything stupid! With this car, you won't go unnoticed. Beat it. I'll take them so you won't call the cops. Julien, you drive. - Why me? - Hurry up! You can't do that! - Why me? - Because it's not me! Drive! Take it, Paul. We follow you. We're out of gas. Impossible. I filled it up. Gйrard! Bastards! They didn't recognized us. Faster! - You are a scumbag! - Sure I am. Stop! Gйrard! Anybody there? Coming! Fill it up! There's two holes in the tank. It should be fixed before. Fill it up! 98 liters. Do I carry on? One step and I kill them. - Give us Mana back! - Give me my wife back. Give me my box back! Flowers, little birds and a blissful peace... I'll exchange you Mana and Odette for my slabs. Your slabs? My box! Sort it out! How? I don't give a damn! Now! This is for you. Plus the cartridges. I don't touch this. I'm a Vietnam deserter. - What about doing a sit-in? - A what? A passive demonstration. We seat and wait. - We wait for what? - That's enough! Cut the bullshit! Wait! Look at this... Hurry up! That's not our fault. That's everybody's fault. Palestinians are abducting Belgians to nab Israelis. Julien! At my order, fire! At my order, fire! - Are you crazy? - Leave that! Vive la France! Julien! - What kind of slabs is that? - Mind your own business! Excuse me. Fake 100$ bills. That's not for rednecks. Now, you know. You're all massed on that side! It defies the laws of surrounding. Try a breakthrough on the east. - On the east? Did I talk to you? They should go in the strategic building. Strategic... Can't you say "at the bailiff's house", like everybody does. - He can't. - That's enough! How much does 100$ make? It was buying 502,48 Frs on Monday's rate. 500 new francs! You can just print what you need anytime, that's so cool. A mattress of bills and I'll become Bastia's mayor. BAILIFF Fighting for other people's money. That's what war is. Julien! Peloux is wounded! Take him at the back! Slowly... He sprained his ankle while taking cover. - He was running and his ankle... - I was running... Things will be better soon. You'll see how better things will be. Charles, the madman is asking you. - Julien! - Yes, boss! - And so? - Well... At last! Can you make Molotov cocktails? No. Bastard. What did you learn from Sartre? I can, bastard, I was at the Sorbonne. Hurry up! And you, beat it! Yes, boss. Where did you heard about Sartre? In prison. - And with that? - Soap flakes. They're gonna have what they ask for. Bastards! Pay me back my truck! Julien! And what will it be for you, sir? You should rest a bit. You skiver, just say something and you'll get back to action. Give him. Now, beat it. - What do I do with that? - Give it to Paul. He'll climb on the roof of the garage and throw it. Wow... - He's crazy! - Why taking Paul to do that? That's his garage, isn't it? And Odette? She's constantly giving him a roasting! Cover me. Hello. Hello, Countess. - Hello, Mr Michalon. - Hello, countess. I'd like 500g of butter, 12 eggs and a pack of rice. What's all that din I heard? It sounds like gunshots. Probably the quarry. They are working a lot right now. I only have brown rice. I heard brown rice is healthier... Do you have mint tea? Flavored tea, with a lot of sugar. A very good beverage. I tasted it for the first time with those young people, in their ball. It was divine. Great, really great! Cut that bullshit and come and that side. You boor! The tea's good, but not fabulous. Children... Shut up! Is my wine coming? Shoot, for Christ's sake! At kids, are you out of your mind? No problem, do it... Get the bus back! - Why always me? - Come on! Odette! Odette, my darling! Shit! I probably put too much soap. - On the right. - I can't. With the kids with us, we'll pass through all the country. We can even ask for a Boeing. - We can't go further. - Jesus Christ! Shit! Here! - Is there another way out? - Yes, sir! Hide yourself! Emile, turn it on and start the visit! We enter into the main alley, known as the chaos alley. We recall you it's forbidden to touch the concretions, all offense or attempt will be followed by legal proceedings. Have a good look around you... You, who love the beauties of nature... Admire the mystic quietness of this enchanting site... How beautiful is a 100$ bill. Julien... Like this, we'll have the means to keep you. A man here, the others with me. Give way, don't stay here! - Yes, inspector. What a carnage! I'm asking the question: what's happened to the lovely village of Loubressac with its 125 quiet inhabitants? Chants bouddhistes Sir! Sir! Yes ? Are Krishna. Mr Michalon, what's new in Loubressac? We found the way.
