'This is RJ Renuka greeting our Malaysian listeners... and Tamils worldwide.' 'Before playing your favourite music, here's important news for today.' 'Just two more days for the prestigious, International Art Festival, in Malaysia.' 'Conqueror of Kadaram' 'Now, some important information for tourists.' 'It's the time of Ramadan and...' 'routine maintenance has been scheduled because of which...' 'the Petronas Twin Towers tour has been suspended for three days.' 'Don't worry. The tour will resume in three days.' 'Meanwhile, there are plenty of other sight-seeing options in Malaysia.' 'Before I share the list with you let's listen to this melodious song.' (Song from 'Japanil Kalyanaraman') 'It's 7.45 pm. Here's to our evening with Ilaiyaraja's music.' 'You were listening to Isai Maalai. It's 12.45 am.' 'Time to sign off and say goodbye. Let's meet again in the morning.' (Song from 'Thoongaa Vanam') Change of plan. Plan change? Two men are chasing me. Who are they? I don't know. Meet me at the other end of the tunnel. I'll be there. No...no Let's leave. Give way. Please step aside. Move away Good. The baby is in the correct position. Can we get a copy of the scan image? Sure. I'll mail it along with the reports. Okay! I saw your test results. So, this is your second visit. Right? Yes, doctor. We visited you the day after we landed in Malaysia. The report says that her blood pressure is borderline. Slightly higher than normal. But, don't worry. Just be a little careful, Ok. What does it mean in layman's terms? It means you have to eat well and be a little careful. That's it. Nothing to worry. Avoid physical activities. Take plenty of rest. Give her the medicines without fail. Sure Do you have elders at home to take care of you? If there is no one tell him to take care of you. One more thing. Avoid travel from now on. That isn't a problem. In the 10 days I've been here he's brought me only to your clinic. So, how is KL? How do you like your new job? I joined work last week. I haven't had such friendly chats with colleagues yet. But, I'm sure I will. They've given you a guesthouse. Right? The guesthouse is amazing. You should drop in some time. It's a very nice place. Isn't it? Yes, doctor. It's a very nice place. Do come home. Sure. So, do you have any specific dates in mind? We can fix it. You know it. Right? Any auspicious dates in mind? No, doctor. Let it be natural. Good. That's better. So, until your next visit be responsible and take care of your girl. Both the girls, Vasu. - See you then. - Sure. Thank you. Take care of yourself. Thank you You seem to be very friendly with the doctor. How many times have you been here by yourself? I was just being nice to get the image quickly. She would've given it even without the flirting. The car is here. Let's go. Are we off to see the Twin Towers now? In about a month the three of us can see it together. "You're all that I need, for nothing more I pray." "Dearest, I'll keep you safe, come what may." "Every moment in your presence envelopes me with joy and fragrance." "Even as I see you a thousand times every day" "My heart yearns for more, I have no say." "My beloved wife, you are my very life." "The magic in your mesmerising eyes, change the hues of my days and nights." "Life is short, my dear." "Let's live it to the fullest, with love and cheer." "Even if the earth splits into pieces," "I'll keep you safe till every worry ceases." "Dear beloved wife you are the fragrance in my life." "My beloved wife, you are my very life." "When you walk, a shadow you won't cast." "I'll take that in, no darkness will get past." "No harm will come your way ever. Your face will wilt in sadness never." "I will always lookout for you." "There is nothing I have to look for beyond you." "Dear beloved wife you are the fragrance in my life." "My beloved wife, you are my very life." We've finally settled down. Do you like this? That's why I married you. I meant the house. - Hey, sorry. - It's Ok. Sit down. Where are you going? I'm feeling hungry. But, you just ate. That was your daughter. She ate her fill. Now I am hungry. Can I bring you milk? I have to be at work. Don't bother. I'll manage. Why? Who will do it after you leave? When I'm around I will do it And when you aren't around? That's why I go for a night shift. What about the nights? Who'll take care of your daughter then? You'll do the job. I'm here for your daughter. For me then? I'll be at work, but, I'll be thinking of you all the time. Nonsense. What can I do with thoughts? Movie-like dialogues! I work night shifts when both of you are asleep. I'm back before you wake up. As if she allows me to sleep at nights. I'm a little scared, Vasu. As the doctor said wish I had someone here. Who do we have? I will have to apply for leave. I've just joined work, you understand, don't you? Don't you understand That being alone at nights is difficult for me. What should we do? Seriously, should I ask for leave? For two months? - That's a stupid idea. - What then? Shall we call my mum? Go ahead. I must leave for work now. I'll try and come back soon. What is it? Nothing. Didn't I tell you to call your mum. It won't be right for me to make the call. It'll be the same for me. So, you won't talk to her. I'll talk. I want our loved ones with us. You know me. Will she talk to me? So, you are still angry? Please Aatirah. Can we talk after I am back? The supervisor gets angry if I'm late. I'll go to the office and I'll see. I'll give her a call. Bye. It's you. I thought it was the doctor. I'm one too. Where is your doctor? He's gone to the Pediatric ward. He'll be back soon. If he asks for me tell him I left. Isn't it wrong to take these outside and run your private clinic? I agree it's wrong. The poor folks near my home keep falling sick... if we can't help them... what's the point in having studied Medicine? What did you say? Medicine... You are making one mistake after another, sister. Don't call me sister. Call me Kumudha. Who is this? I don't see a name. That's the accident case in bed three. Injury in the head and abdomen. He's been sutured and is sedated. Monitor him. Police? The police brought him here. We have to give them a call when he wakes up. Don't forget. Okay My phone doesn't work here. There's no network coverage here. It's fairly good in that corner. Where is she? Doctor? - Where is Kumudha? - She left. How can she leave without informing me? She said her duty hours were over. She has to inform me. How can I supervise all the wards? Do I have 10 hands? - What? - Nothing. You too will have to inform me before you leave. You can't just leave. Doctor Hello! Hey, move. He was gasping for breath. I was trying to... What? You have to send for me. You shouldn't be doing this. I'll be answerable. No one will question you. He was wearing a white coat. So I thought he was a doctor. Okay! Can you tell us more about him? I didn't pay attention. He was gasping for breath. I was taking care of that. I followed him to the corridor. But he was gone by then. Anything about him? No. It was a bike accident. No IDs on him. The traffic police brought him in. How is he now? Concussion, contusion and deep cut on the abdomen. It's a head injury. He is unconscious. There is a cut on the abdomen. A knife wound? I'm not sure. It could be because of the accident too. Wouldn't you know the difference, doctor? It's a deep cut. I can't say much now. We have to examine him more on that angle. When will he wake up? We need to question him. We've stopped sedation. He should be up in a few hours. - Fingerprint images? - Yes. Navin, post our person as guard here... to inform us as soon as he's up. Sure. Elvin, stay here. Keep me informed. Yes, sir. This is my number. If you happen to recollect anything about that person... - feel free to call me. - Ok. - Navin - Okay, sir You come along with me. Don't attend to the patient without my permission. Understand? I can understand Even if the patient is in danger, I should wait for you. Right? Don't be smart. Remember, you're not on our rolls yet. And I get to decide that. Until then I'm responsible for everything here. You're done for the day. You can leave now. You should have woken me up. Go and sit down. I won't. - Aatirah... - Please go. You want to know what happened at work today? Go on. I was the hero of the day. I prevented a serious incident. Someone tried to kill a patient. He was unconscious. If not for me, he would be dead now. The police came to investigate. It was like a scene out of the movies. So, you didn't call my mum. Who is that, Vasu? Vasu Vasu Who are you? Vasu Vasu Vasu Aatirah 'Talk.' 'What happened? What did you do?' I did nothing. Where are you? - Vasu - Aatirah 'Listen to me, doctor.' - Who are you? - 'Calm down.' 'The patient you saved last night. Bed number 305.' 'You have to get him out. Nobody should know.' How can I do that? Vasu Aatirah Please stop it. - What should I do? - 'I just told you.' 'You have to bring him out. If the police get to know, she'll be dead.' Stop it. Please. I'll do it. 'The next time I call, you should be out with him.' 'You have three hours to do this.' Hello! There is undue pressure from the higher-ups. Close the case quickly. It's a very big case now. A lot of big-wigs are involved. Gather all the evidence. The Press is full-on following us. So get all the evidence and details as soon as possible. Keep me informed. - Call me if need be. - Sure, sir. Good morning, madam. Why was our Chief with Vincent? Vincent is handling the Tower murder case. Get to work. Have the fingerprints been screened? I'll do it right away. Do it immediately. I want it right away. Sure. Why do all the big cases go to Vincent? He is well-connected, will go to any extent to solve a case. Our Chief would never agree to do the kind of things he does. - So, is it wrong to follow procedures? - Maybe. The Chief is under immense pressure... to solve the case within 24 hours. So? So... Let's do our work now. Go on. Search the criminal files too. You'll never know. 'When I ask you to come here, you have to.' I can't help you otherwise. Listen to me I understand The information is correct. But you have to be here. I'll call back. I need to take him for an X-ray. Madam, we've got something. No. I will manage. I have to be with him. 'So what have we got on him?' His name is KK. He has several aliases. The last used alias was KK. What's KK? It just says KK. Could be Karthikeyan, Kumaran, Kevin, Kabir, Kennedy... It just says KK. The crime list is long. Which floor? Twelfth floor. Alert our guard. Restrict all movement till we get there. What happened? Nothing. I banged my head on the door. Hello! Taking him for an X-ray. Ok. We have to go down. Back to the ward. Charged for kidnapping, robbery, theft. Has been a suspect. But never convicted. Charges never proven. Very intelligent. He served five years in prison... for attacking a police vehicle carrying arms. He is back in business now. He has strong connections with gangsters and thugs. He is in high demand. He used these connections for his job too. What job? Yes. The surprise is that he was trained under our own STAGG. He was one of our best commandos. He was undercover for some time. He turned into a double agent. A double agent? Yes. The records say so. He is an expert in breaking into safes. He is wanted by the Penang Police also. He has surfaced after all these years. Don't know for what. That sounds very dangerous. This is one in Vincent's list of unsolved cases. Yes If Vincent couldn't do it, we must do it. What is that injection? Epinehrine... Adrenaline. Adrenaline shot. Who are you? I'm a doctor. Where are we? In a hospital. Let's go. I know nothing about you. They've kidnapped my wife and want me to get you out of here. Stay calm and come with me. Let's get out of here. Put on those clothes. Vasu Move. Park the car. What's your number? - What? - Sorry. - The doctor's number? - Which doctor? - Any doctor. - What? Do you know Suresh? Suresh? - Let me check. - Okay Ambulance. Bus. Where is he? Took him for an X-ray. He's not answering the phone. Search for them. Damn it - Are you Ok? - Yes. So, you don't remember anything that happened. Next camera. They go up to the twelfth floor. Since there is renovation happening there are no cameras up there. Wow! He escaped right under your nose. That's too bad. What are you doing here, Vincent? I should be asking you that. What are you doing here? This is an important case. Hey, what? Why are you getting angry? It's an order from the higher-ups. They think he is a suspect in the industrialist's murder. This case isn't about some silly domestic quarrel. So, you can leave. This is a prima facie case of robbery. This fellow has assaulted my officer. So, both the cases are mine. Let's go. Move. Play it. Hello! 'What happened?' - We've got out. - 'Where is he?' He is with me. Where are you? Old Harbour. At our usual place, brother. What is Anand Makaio saying? He wants to meet you. You stay there. I'll come over. Where is my wife? Don't worry. She's safe. Go home. She'll be back in the evening. - Evening? - Yes Stop. What's going on? Tell them to fetch her right away. I can't wait. Tell them to come now... to a crowded place. Tell them to come to the Metro station. Gunfire at a bus station. The two who escaped from here. We've to get there before Vincent and gang. Tell our person in the Criminal Records Section... to pull out all information about KK and that doctor. Ok. Where are you? We've reached. I see you. I'm coming. Let's go. Wait. - Aatirah - Wait Vasu Let me go. Who are those people? Tell him to come back. Its me Yes, brother. Let's meet at our usual spot in Port Klang tonight. Ok, brother. I can't wait until tonight. Bring her right now. If we don't leave now they'll kill us all. Ask them to come back now. Put that away. We have to be alive to see your wife alive. Let's go, come. This way. Let's get away from here. The sutures have given way. Let's fix this first. Take me to Aatirah. I'll do whatever you want after that. Which place in the harbour? The flour factory at the old harbour. - This won't hold until then. - Take me to my wife first. Put that away. Your priority is to save me. I would do that if I were you. Drive. I'll tell you where to go. Was it him? He didn't shoot. It was the other person. - It wasn't him? - No. If we need more information you have to come to the police station. Ok. So, the doctor fired the gun. So, the doctor took KK hostage. That doctor has abducted KK. What do you make of that? I don't get it, mam. - Tell me. - Nothing. The doctor doesn't have a criminal record. He came with his wife to KL just 10 days back. No records on her too. Nandha. Age 26. He was with KK in prison. He was released the same time as KK. Now he is KK's partner. Start an inquiry. Talk to the neighbours, colleagues. And talk to my source. Let's see if we get any information. Sure! Pass to me Pass the ball Get the key. Where's the First Aid kit? If you stay quiet I don't have to tie you up. Understood? Kill him. It's done. Stop. Where are you going? I smell of the hospital. Need to take a shower. Keep the door open. None of us knew this about Vasu. Is this a kidnap for ransom? How are they connected? They've assaulted a police officer and stolen his gun. They've attacked the doctor who tried to help. They've tried to rob the cash truck at the shopping mall. If you spot either of them the police need to be informed. Since they have been identified as terrorists... you must be cautious. I don't know him. If I get to know anything, I'll inform you. Thank you. Hello! Madam, this is Vasu. The doctor you're on the lookout for. I'm in no way connected to him. My wife was kidnapped. They said they'll kill her if I don't get him out. I don't know anything more. I didn't do anything. Ok. Calm down. Is he with you now? Yes. Where? If you want my help you have to tell me where you are. Quick, Vasu. No.402, Taman Desaria Block A We'll come over right away. Stay there. Do you hear me? Hello? Ok. Okay! No. 402 Block A Taman Desaria Don't tell the others. Vincent's gang in particular. I'll wait there for you. Hurry up. Stay put. They've kidnapped my wife. I have nothing to do with him. You made this a tough chase. They kidnapped my wife to get him out of the hospital. I'm innocent. What's going on here? Are you... You shouldn't have come here. Let me remind you This is my case. Are you Ok? That belongs to my wife. They're the ones who've kidnapped my wife. Do you know them? Who let her in here? I tried stopping her. But, She came up somehow. Idiots. You go and take care of the ground. I'm coming. Clean it. I am going to secure the video. Finish it... and clean up. Idiot, put on your jacket. Hold it. Hold the gun properly. You shot her down using this gun. And I had no choice but to shoot you both. What? How does this story sound? Sounds good? I have to kill this guy first. Check this out. A bonus. What else do you have? Are there more safe houses? You are living a good life. Take it. There is one more. Just go See if anyone is coming. Tell me what's going on here? Who are you guys? Speak up. You'll be the one talking. The Police will be here any minute. They'll have questions for you. If you don't talk I'll fire the next one into your mouth. Okay Okay...okay Okay We are from Criminal Investigations. We are from the same team. Who is that? Our officers. But, from another team. What are you investigating? Why are you trying to kill me? At times we offer extra services to our clients. What service? All kinds. You'll understand. How are you connected to the industrialist? His son hired us. He didn't want to include his son in his Will. So, we made him re-write his Will. His final Will. Vincent wanted to set up the case as murder for gain. So, we asked Anand Makaio for a person to break into the industrialist's safe. He sent you. Wait here. He told you that your case documents were in the safe and got you there. So, you'll end up being the murderer. The plan was to kill you... and frame you as the murderer. But you escaped. How are Vincent and Anand Makaio connected? What video is it? There was a security camera in the office. Since we were investigating the case we got hold of the video. We wanted to kill you first and... later use the video... to demand money from the industrialist's son. That was their plan. Whose plan? Vincent... and Anand Makaio's. Where is that video now? Maybe in a flash drive. Must be with Vincent. I swear I don't know anything else. Please How did you get this address? The police are here. KK and the doctor killed our madam. What? KK and the doctor killed our madam. They've held our men hostage. Anand Makaio is the one... who wants you dead. He is on his way to meet your guy and that girl. Which girl? Did you mean my wife? Where is she being held? What have you guys done to her? Tell me. Tell me Tell me where she is. Try asking the guys who are coming up. Please tell me. The suspect is on the run... bike registration number WBJ 9890. I repeat. Follow his bike. Hurry up. Don't move. No. Don't move. They shot us and escaped. No, idiot Move Suspect is on the Jalan Tun Razak bridge. I repeat. Suspect has entered the Jalan Tun Razak bridge. Come in for control room. Keep us informed on the status. Another backup team is on the way. - Out. - Hey, who are you? Block car with WPD 960 registration. This is a public place. Put your gun away, idiot. Stay where you are. Step back Don't come any closer. I'll kill her. - Step back. - You're committing a mistake. - Step back. - Okay - I don't want to do this. - Leave her - Don't come any closer. - Okay Step back. Step back. I'll kill her. Don't step out. Step back. I'm sorry. Please take care. Forgive me. "You're all that I need, for nothing more I pray." "Dearest, I'll keep you safe, come what may." "No harm will come your way ever." "Your face will wilt in sadness never." "I will always lookout for you." "There is nothing I have to look for beyond you." Hey! Who are you? Shut up. How many have died? Answer us. Have you removed my fingerprints on that gun? He attacked all of a sudden. Idiot! Did he ask you about anything? He didn't. Sorry. Not now. They've killed so many. We need an answer. They've killed police officers. Please comment. Stop. You can't go in. The case has gone out of proportion. Do whatever you need to. You have to take them both into custody. Whatever it takes. Close this today. - Sir We were working along with madam on this case. She came here because that doctor had called her. Sir, if you allow us... She came here without informing us. See what happened. I'd warned you about the case being too big for your team... that you can't handle it. - I warned you, people... - Vincent I understand your anger. Kalpana is my colleague too. You can't be angry and do this job. You have to be composed. Vincent will handle the case from now. But, sir... Police officers have been murdered. - Get them quick. - Sir If need be... ...don't hesitate to shoot them. Sure, sir. We are on it completely. Trust me, sir. We will get them. I'm done with this police-robber game. Alert our men at the harbour. Talk to Anand Makaio. Tell him that when KK calls, he has to inform us. Don't worry. Vincent will get them. Let's go. No. I'll drive madam's car. - Where is Nandha? - He's right here. Come out. Stop it. Just listen to us. Step out, KK. Where is Aatirah? Where is my wife? Oh God! Who is this? Where's my wife? Didn't he kidnap Aatirah for you? What's going on? I shouldn't have helped you. It's my fault. Where have they taken her? Is she all right? You better tell me... Your wife is alive. How can you be so sure? Please tell me. She will be kept alive till they find us. Tomorrow, on hearing the news of her husband's death... unable to bear the shock she'll jump out of the window and kill herself. But, she's pregnant. So? We have to get hold of that video on the pen drive. That's at the headquarters and the Police are on the lookout for us. How can we break in? Greetings! Go ahead. Don't forget us. Be careful.
