I miss you, Elmo. - Oh, Elmo misses you, too, but Elmo's happy to see you now. - I'm really happy to see you too. I feel very lucky we get to talk like this. It's wonderful. - Yeah. Yeah, it is wonderful. Oh, so what has-- what has Miss Anne been doing at home? - What have I been doing? - Yeah. - Well, I've been trying to do all sorts of new things. So I've been--oh, I've been practicing how to balance a ball on my head. Wanna see? - Oh, let us see. - Oh, I need to practice a little more. Pretty good! - Pretty good, though. - And--oh! Sometimes when I wanna calm myself down, I take a deep breath in and I raise my shoulders up to my ears, and then when I exhale, I push them down. - Ooh, that's nice. Can Elmo try it with you? - Thank y--please. Let's do it together. - Okay, okay. - Okay, inhale in and raise our shoulders. And exhale down and push your shoulders down. - Boy, that felt really good. - I feel a little better, right? - Yeah. - So let's see. What else do I do? Oh, I've been baking bread. - Ooh! - It's really fun because there's a part when you get the dough all ready to go and you have to knead it and you sort of knead it and you push down on it, and it's really fun, and then when I run out of everything else to do, you know what I do to make myself happy? - What? - I put on my favorite shoes and I kick my toes up in the air. That's funny. So let's see. Um, so Anne has been using her head, her shoulders, she's been kneading, and she's been wiggling her toes. - Elmo, you know what I just heard when you said that? - What? - I didn't hear knead. I heard knee, and that made me think of the game "Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes"! - And toes! - Yes! Should we play that game? - Oh, Elmo would love to. - Oh, I'd love to play it too. Oh, Elmo. I just had a thought. It's not the best idea for us to touch our faces right now, so when we get to eyes, ears, mouth, and nose, we should probably just point, right? - Yeah, good idea. - Okay. Should we play? - Let's do it. - Great. Okay. All right. Let's start off. Okay. ♪ Head, shoulders, knees, and toes ♪ ♪ Knees and toes ♪ ♪ Head, shoulders, knees, and toes ♪ ♪ Knees and toes ♪ ♪ My eyes, my ears, my mouth, and my nose ♪ ♪ Head, shoulders, knees, and toes ♪ ♪ Knees and toes ♪ - Yeah!

How do I look now? - Right side up. - My favorite way to be. Wait a minute. Where am I? Am I in space? How did I get in space? And without my trusty space suit! Oh... - Uh, Grover? Grover, Elmo thinks that maybe Grover pushed a button on your phone. - Hmm? Oh, yes. I see it now. Ah, thank goodness. It--wait a minute. Is my head really that big? Or is my little body so little? Oh, dear. - Grover--Grover, Grover, Grover, Elmo thinks that your phone is doing that. Your phone. - My ph--oh, yes. Yes. Uh, that is better. Oh, look! Look!

Silly. - Did somebody say crafts? - No, Elmo didn't say crafts, Abby. - Oh, that's okay. I just wanted to share something I made. Isn't it cute? I made a platypus out of a paper bag. I used construction paper for the little flippers and then I used pen for the eyes. Isn't he cute? His name's Bruce. Bruce the paper platypus puppet. I just love making things out of what you have around the house, like pipe cleaners and cotton balls and lots of glitter. Don't you, Elmo? - Yeah. Oh, Elmo's been drawing and coloring a lot. - Oh, hi, Elmo. - Oh, hi, Cookie Monster. - Hi, Cookie Monster. - H--hi, Abby. Hey, Elmo, me ready to show how to bake cookies now. - Oh, oh, great. - Yeah, yeah, me, uh--me greased the cookie sheet so the cookies come off nice and easy. - Yeah. - That's a good idea. - Uh, and, uh, me preheat oven to 350. - 350, got it. - Yep. Now, the only thing is that me ate the recipe, so me not know what ingredients to use. - Oh, well, I can help you there, Cookie Monster. You got some oatmeal? - Uh, no, me ate that. - Oh, you got any eggs? - Uh, no, me ate them. - Sugar? - Uh, no, me ate it. - Butter? - Uh, no, me brush teeth with it. - Flour? - No, me no got flour! Me no got salt! Me no got anything! Me ate everything! Oh, me so embarrassed. Me no can make cookies. - Oh, well, that's too bad. - Wait--wait a minute.

Like Julia's daddy, he's an EMT. - What's an EMT? - Uh, I don't know, but he's really busy right now and he hardly ever gets home. - Oh, an EMT is someone who helps take care of people and makes sure they get to the doctor safe and sound. - Wow. - There are so many heroes right now. The doctors, the nurses, the police officers and firefighters. - Well said, Abby. - Yeah. Oh, oh! And then there's the people who do all sorts of things like--like pick up the trash, oh, and put things on shelves in the stores, oh, and mail carriers too. - Right, there's a lot of people out there helping us along, and we're all thankful. - Hey--hey, what if we say a big yay for them right now? - Oh, great idea, Abby.
