Prophecy... ...Prophecy. ''Blessed is he who reads aloud the words of the prophecy. And blessed are those who hear and who keep what is written therein, for the time is near. He is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him. Everyone who pierced him and all the tribes of the earth will wail on account of him. But l have this against you: that you have abandoned the love you had. And l saw a beast rising out of the sea with 10 horns and seven heads... and a blasphemous name upon its head. And to it, the dragon gave his power. And the whole earth followed the beast with wonder. And they worshipped the beast saying, 'Who is like the beast?' and 'Who can fight against the beast?' lt opened its mouth to utter blasphemous... words against God. Then l saw a new heaven, and a new earth. And l heard a great voice from the throne saying, 'Behold, the dwelling of God is with men. He will dwell with them and they shall be His people. And God Himself will be with them. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. And death shall be no more. Neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain any more. For these things will have passed away. To the thirsty l will give water without price... from the fountain of the water of life. But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the polluted, as for the murderers, fornicators, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars... their lot shall be in the lake that burns with fire.' And he said to me, 'Do not seal up the words of the prophecy, for the time is near. Behold. l am coming soon.''' ''lf anyone who slays with a sword then he must--'' - Yeah. - lt's just you're putting it too quick. ''lf anyone who slays with a sword...'' - Do you think that bass line is too-- - No. That's-- that's-- that's one of the best bits. Because in an arena, that's the bit that's just gonna shake the whole room. This is the opening of the show, and l'm reading from the book of Revelations. lt's before the band gets onstage, it's before l come on stage, and... it's meant to sort of set the mood. lt's a bit scary. There is some poetry in the New Testament. - Yeah. - He doesn't believe in God. He's not spiritual at all. Uh, no-- l don't-- l don't really believe in God. That really hurts me to hear that. Why does it hurt you? Why does it hurt anyone to hear that someone doesn't believe in God? What's the problem with that? Because then you don't-- then you don't believe in-- in anything past this physical life that you live. You can believe in something that passes without having to believe in God. - Do you believe in reincarnation? - Yeah. - You do? - l believe in lots of things that are beyond-- that are beyond the physical world. You don't believe that there's a supreme power or higher energy force that had something - to do with the creation of the world? - Yeah, but why does that - have to be labeled ''God''? - Okay, how about ''Energy''? - Yeah. - Or ''The Light''? All right, how about Energy, but-- ''Blessed is he who reads aloud the words of the prophecy.'' l refer to an entity called the beast. ''Who can fight against the beast?'' l feel like l'm describing the world that we live in right now. ''Those of you who have not known what some call the deep things of Satan.'' To me, the beast is the modern world that we live in, the material world, the physical world, the world of illusion that we think is real. We live for it, we're enslaved by it and it will ultimately be our undoing. l mean, l like the juxtaposition of telling people they're all going to go to hell if they don't, um... turn away from their wicked behavior. Now we've got to pay attention, because all this-- all this gossip about God is distracting me. Do you have any good jokes? What's the great thing about fucking 28-year-olds? - Um... - There's 20 of them. That's terrible. l used to audition for shows all the time when l was a dancer, and l got cut from all of them. And it was a miserable experience. l always, like, stuck out too much and couldn't, sort of, blend in with everybody else. And that's really what l look for, l look for people who have something special. Her dancers, her performers, they have to be powerful. They have to be able to accent Madonna, and that's a hard thing to do. And, and-- Do we dig Diggo? - Can he tap-dance for me today? - Yeah. Let's keep him, keep him in our harem. - Thank you. - Okay, good stuff. That's an awfully long bamboo stick you have, sir. Bye. Oh, l'm glad l'm not a dancer anymore. lt's a dog's life. - 31 , no. - No. - 278, no. - No. So thank you, guys. l'm sorry. l'm sorry, you guys. Are you on any medication? Do any of you smoke grass? - What's grass? - Yes or no? Do any of you smoke weed? Huh? - Could you do it less? - Huh? Could you-- could you do it less? Oh yeah. No, l've-- yeah. Yeah? Not because l'm morally opposed to it, l just want to get the most out of it-- out of you guys. Okay? Okay, well, you're hired. You're hired. l think l've found some fantastic dancers. l don't think of them as dancers, l think of them as actors, performance artists. They have character and they move me. And it's got much more to do with who they are than the way they move their bodies. l'm speechless right now. - Thank you very very much. - Sure. Lucky number! - This is my boy! - We came through together. l can't wait. l can't even wait for the first show. l just want to do-- do-- do it. l'm one of the young ones on the tour. And now we get yelled at because we're late. l'm not going to hide or be scared of anything. l like Cabbalah. lt doesn't conflict with Hinduism - because it's not a religion. - Body-wise, mentally-wise, you really got to be on your shit. On your shit. l'm a Christian, so l believe in heaven and hell. l'm from Mesquite, Texas. We have a big rodeo and that's about it. l'm a Bronx girl. lf you're straight and you don't go to a titty bar, there's a problem. Yeah, titty-- titty-- titty bar. Clap clap, turn around. Do you see the change in my energy? l was born in Buenos Aires. My personality's a little bit weird. Who would have thought, like-- who would have thought, like my first tour would be Madonna? You live positive, it all comes back. Back. Back. Whatever Madonna wants, that's what we're gonna give her. We're just running the show, all the-- all the staged-- all the dance numbers before we get to the sound stage and things start having to get broken down. Because usually how we work is once we get to the stage, we have to do things in chunks, you know what l mean? Then the stage becomes a beast that we have to tame. l'm gonna get a real Scottish bagpipe player. - Why? He just blows. - Jamie! You won't know the difference. Who is it? One of your band members? - No, he's gonna come from Scotland. - And he just plays in that one number? We can use him for other things. She's got a dancing part for me as well, so-- that was a bit of a shock. When you're putting a show together, it's like life during wartime. Everyone has to pay attention. No one can fuck up. l wish l could live with this kind of mindset all the time. l love it. l love the energy of it. And l love the idea that we're creating something together, that there's a unity. Slutbox in a nun's outfit? Can you just do me a favor? Don't stick your leg up on the TV like that, because it hikes your thing up and you can see your shorts. We want people to think you're a real nun. Good luck with that one. See, Paul's looks real-- his beard. But they're not distracted by anything and they don't look at women. lt's gonna be rough for you guys. - They don't look at women? - No. - Most priests are gay, you know? - l've heard. So... l've got some connections at the Vatican. Oh Jeez. Well, religion breeds fragmentation. These religious costumes, for most people, end up separating everybody. So the idea is you're taking off the thing that separates them so that you can all be one consciousness, okay? - Obey the laws of the universe. - Find your hat. We're gonna do this. A little bit nervous. Not too nervous. l actually felt quite mellow about an hour ago. That's what all my fans will be doing in their seats. l like to think of the show as, um, like an art installation. And if l think of it like that, then l don't feel like l have to, um-- l don't know. l don't think l have to achieve perfection every night. lt's really hard to not be nervous. But like the-- Rob said to me last night-- l said, ''Oh God, thousands of people are going to be here. l hope l'm not going to be nervous.'' He said, ''You won't be nervous. They're not thousands of people, they're thousands of lights. You just have to think of them like that.'' Light is... fearlessness. Light is... compassion. Light is all-giving and it's-- it's immortality. lt's a place where there's no chaos, no pain and no suffering. Light is the laws of the universe. You can do things to connect to it or you can do things to disconnect. That's what l say l fear-- disconnecting. Hi, you guys. - Hotcha, how're you doing? - l'm okay. Oops. Awww. Oh, that's pretty. Who's that from, l wonder. A flower with a necklace. An admirer, obviously. Good idea, you putting Fanta in this can, Dan. l've got to get ready for the show. l'm a nervous wreck. - Eat anything? - Yeah. We'll finally be doing this for an audience, it's great! - Little butterflies. - l can't stop shitting. Uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh. l have a nervous stomach. Great show, great show, great show. - Let's do it! - All right! - Let's go! - Opening night! Yeah, run along, darling. Um, what's the difference between a pop star and a terrorist? - A pop star and a terrorist? - You can negotiate with a terrorist. Suddenly my corset feels tighter and my heels feel higher. l just-- l just want us all to go out there, and take the people in the audience to another place, and inspire them to be better versions of the people that they are already. l thank you all, each and every one of you, for being a part of this experience with me. l feel so grateful. l feel so excited. l feel so honored. Let's go out there and have the best time ever tonight. Be safe and let's shine like the brightest lights. - Amen. - Amen. What are you looking at? - Yeah yeah yeah! - Yes! Let's go, crew! Run this mother! That's how we do! Let it out! We'll bring it every night like that! Hey, mamba! - How are you? - Ahh. Marcus is opening the champagne. Look what you've done. - Oh, bloody hell. - Oh no. l hate doing that. l hate doing that. Okay, you have to stay out of the way. You've never seen asses blinging like this, huh? But this show, you're-- l mean, there's some political punches in here. - Well, good. - Yeah? - That's what you're after? - Yeah. - Piss some people off? - No, l'm not pissing people off. - This wakes people up. - Ah. Madison Square Gardens, New York City. Nice skirt, Marlyn... you're almost wearing. There was a time where she used to make sense, and now it's just a bit-- Let's see how fast this time. Ready-- Can you just sing ''Looking for Love in All the 'Wong' Places''? But do it with feeling. Do it. Do it. No, l didn't say speak with a cockney accent. l said sing it, motherfucker. Now get over here. The audition is not over. Get over here. You haven't done it right. One more time. Do it for me, baby. Now sing it. You're hired. Okay, l can get on with my day now. Just go braid your fucking hair, okay? Don't make things complicated. You have privacy to do physical therapy. You can have people in there. - Where's my bathroom? - Your bathroom's down the hall. Um, l have to pee. You don't want to hear me pee. Get out. Get out! How are ya? Good, nice to see ya. Yes yes! Come on, let's take it! Now we're gonna see what Machine-Gun Kelly's all about. Guy somehow manages to usurp the security guards and turn them into his jujitsu partners. Mainly Kelly, who l never see anymore. He's always down on the mats with Guy. l think men cannot resist the invitation to fight... one another. They get into their shorts and they lay down on the floor, and they just hug each other for like two hours. They sweat and they hug and they grunt, and they sit on each other's faces. My husband is more intimate with the people he does jujitsu with than he is with me. Sometimes l walk in and l'm like, ''We haven't done that position.'' Arthur, you're up. Thanks for the roll. Ooh. A couple of the dancers wanted to know-- when will you grace your presence at a function that we can all enjoy together? You know what? l don't-- that's the problem. l don't feel good. Are you registered to vote, by the way? - No. - Why not? Because l've never ever done it, so l didn't know what to do. - That's no fucking excuse. - That's what those people are doing. You sign up and register to vote, Aries, or l'm not speaking to you anymore. Now get the fuck out of here. Are you guys registered to vote? We're here just trying to get people to understand that they can register to vote. l'm really touched that you actually made the effort. See? l went and did it all by myself. You understand that not registering for the vote is not the only thing you have to do, right? - Now l have to vote, right? - Yeah. - Do you know who you're gonna vote for? - Kerry? Don't say it with a question mark on the end. - Kerry. l'm voting for Kerry. - Thank you. Let's shake hands. You're now at the top of my list, okay? - Bye, Aries. - Bye, get out of here. Who was that? Jesus? How are you, darling? - Hi. - You are? What's going on down there? Um, so you know-- shall we, like, smooch and kiss and shall l tell you how much l love you - before you go on? - Why start now? No, but l do that before every show, darling. - You do? - Sure. Guy, you haven't been to one of my shows in about three weeks. Maybe we should leave. l have funny kind of butterflies in my stomach. - Do you? - That's good. l don't understand what's wrong with me. Well... - neither do l. - You've been saying that for years. When's kickoff? Shouldn't you be out there? Yeah, l'm just fucking about. l had to interview some people outside for you. - You did? - Yeah. We're gonna bring some breaking news on D.A.N. about the Madonna concert. Willy Wonka. That was his name. A chap from Puerto Rico called Willy Wonka. Really? That's not a real name. Willy Wonka, they call me that in Puerto Rico. l think the most important thing for me to Madonna is like, the ''Express Yourself'' stuff. Let me tell you, he's a fan. - ls he? - Oh yeah. And tell me, what do you think of her new man? - What's his name? - Guy Ritchie. - Uh, Guy Ritchie, yeah. - Mr. Ritchie? Well, personally l don't know him. And the only things that l know is that he's a great director. lt's the only thing that l know. But don't you think he's a good-looking guy? Thank you, Mr. Wonka, and good night. Thank you. Thank you, sir. l like Mr. Wonka. - Do l look okay? - Yeah, you look magnificent, darling. Or do l look like a bad imitation of Little Bo Peep and Shirley Temple? No, darling, you look very good. All right, give us a kiss. Go on, run along. Mrs. R, fly like a bird. Where is everybody? Well, as you can see, l don't have any friends. God, you've got to work hard for a New York crowd. You could've worked a bit harder, couldn't you? Well done, girl. l was wondering when someone was going to come and visit me. l was starting to get freaked out-- like did l turn everybody off or something? No no, l was taking care of all your customers out there. lt was an amazing show. l mean, l even danced once. That's a lot for me. Do you want me to massage your feet or something? - A little foot massage, perhaps? - ls something wrong with you? Now, l give you foot massages every night, Mrs. Ritchie. You do not! l just want people to wake up. lt's just the worst thing, that half the country's asleep. Half the people don't vote, half the people don't get involved. And Jeez, she stuck her neck out there for me tonight. l thought, that's a crazy thing to do, man. Michael, l know you're out there tonight, and l just wanted to publicly thank you for sticking your neck out, for going against the establishment, for giving us all hope. The world needs more people like you. Thank you. l was stunned. l was like-- kind of everything went into slow motion in my head. - l saw Michael in the audience. - l was looking for him. - l sent a team-- - l decided not to point them out when l got booed. Like 10 people booed me when l said something. - Did you-- really? - Yeah, right near the front. - l didn't hear the boos. - Good. My big thing in life is not about vote for this person or vote for that person or vote for this cause or vote for that cause. My thing is, take responsibility for yourself and the world around you. She should keep politics out of it. l thought l was coming to a music show, not a political democratic convention. lt's foolish for anyone to think that at any time, that they're being looked after or that their government is protecting them and taking care of them. - Are my friends in here? - Yes! l think it's important to vote because it means that the person is taking charge and being involved in the community that they live in or the world that they live in. - lt was amazing. - That was very generous. lt's only one aspect, you know what l mean? There's a thousand trillion billion other things that we need to do as well. l think a lot of people tonight were very moved by what she said, the songs she sang, the video up on the screen. The image of the lsraeli and the Palestinian child arm in arm... man! Everybody had tears in their eyes around me. And, uh... because everybody wants to live in that world. Everybody is sick and tired of the way it is. l've always thought that my job was to wake people up. But it's not enough just to wake people up. You've got to wake people up and give them a direction. You've got to wake people up and give them tools about how to deal with life. You've got to wake people up and give them solutions. Otherwise they're gonna fall back asleep again. ln harvest-time, in the fall, we usually go to each field. We'll pick 100 berries and we'll crush them in a little bag. And then we run sugar tests on them, acidity and pH. Then we have to make a decision whether we want to leave them out there or bring them in and do adjustments in the laboratory. We used to come here every year. All our kids came up here, even Madonna. l used to always reward her for achievement. She was an achiever. She was. My relationship with my father when l was younger is very different than what it is now. When l was younger, l didn't understand my father. The fact that she lost her mother at such a young age affected her in a very strong way, as it affected all the kids. So you have to learn to adjust to the new situations, adjusting to Joan and the new family structure. And that's not easy. Going into the entertainment business was probably that venue or at that avenue of expression that she needed to fulfill her own needs. l couldn't wait to leave. l couldn't wait to go to New York. l wanted to be an artist and my dad wanted to protect me in his way. He truly felt that the only way for me to have happiness in life was to get a college degree, to be a lawyer or a doctor or one of those dependable jobs, which gave me more fuel to be angry with him. When you're young, you're not thinking about all that other stuff. You're just thinking about where you are, what you're doing, how you're gonna get ahead. And as we get older, we learn what's important. So, l got pregnant... with my daughter. And l just was like, ''Holy shit.'' And l don't really know what l'm going to teach her about life when l'm not really sure l understand what the meaning of life is. So that really was the turning point for me. l now see that my father went through hell, and l see the struggles that my father had and the sacrifices he made to raise eight children. So it took me awhile to grow up. As she grew up and became popular, l mean, there's things she's said and did that l found totally dissatisfying. When l was running around getting my pictures taken in lockers of gay porn theaters and stuff like that-- that's something a dad can be proud of. He's my new boyfriend. But to me it was like a growing process. She's growing up. And instead of growing up at home with us, she's growing up with the world. Heavenly Father, thank you for the blessings You bestow on all of us, the life You have given us, the air we breathe, the people we spend our life with; give them strength to endure and to go on with their performance. Thank You for all Your blessings. - Amen! - Amen. Dad, l'm going to swear now. Don't be upset, okay? We're gonna tear the roof off this fucker-- oooh! - Because we-- - Rock the house! - Because you-- - Are the shit! - Because l-- - Am the queen! - Because he-- - ls your dad! Whoo! l still can't swear in front of my dad. What l saw at last night's performance was a more positive... outreaching of her to the public. Her concern for the world, for people, to me that's maturity. Werner's gonna stay and bring your parents up. Were they in the chaser car? We were behind you. They were in-- Were they in front, l think? - They was in front. - Yeah. - Did it seem like they had a good time? - Great time. Good. Oh, Dad? Did you like it? l thought it was very good. l said, ''At one point here, she's gonna-- go down, break in half.'' l kind of liked-- you had the religious theme there, l saw all the-- the Cabbalah and the Jesus and all that. And l thought that was very nice. l've looked at the Cabbalah thing. l've read some of the books she gave me. So to me, there's nothing in Cabbalah that's not in the Scripture. That was probably the most positive concert you ever put on. - Trying to make a difference. - l was impressed with that. l finally pulled my head out of my ass. ln the end, you know, we all believe in one god. l think most people do. Gosh. Wow. Las Vegas isn't so bad after all. There's a television in the bathtub. - But how do you switch the channels? - The shower's not bad either, luv. This is so much fun. Ooooh. - Guy? - Yeah? - Where are you? - Someone's making some money around here. Baby, we're gonna hit the town tonight! Okay, let's all say a prayer tonight so we can get through the show. l mean, this is-- l speak for everybody, l think. - Yeah. - l just-- l don't wanna react to all the Japanese businessmen playing with their Blackberries during my songs... or people leaving every time l sing a ballad to get hot dogs. lt's okay, l'm not upset. l'll still keep on singing. l'm not gonna care. l'm just gonna channel light, and fuck their hot dogs. - Bring it in. Bring it in. - One, two, three-- sorry-ass motherfuckers! Dirty. Dirty. Dirty. l was in a very bad mood this afternoon, so l wrote this poem-- ''l have a cage, it's called the stage. When l'm let out, l run about, Then sing and dance and sweat and yell, l have so many tales to tell. l like to push things to the edge, And inch my way along the ledge. l feel like God, l feel like shit, the paradox, an even split...'' More sound-- say ''ah, eh, ih.'' ''lt's just a job, l always say, l should be grateful every day. Sometimes l think l just can't do it, but l persist and l get through it. And l console myself each night...'' l got married for all the wrong reasons. And when my husband didn't turn out to be everything l imagined he'd be, l just wanted to end everything. There's no such thing as the perfect soul mate. lf you meet someone and you think they're perfect, you better run as fast as you can in the other direction 'cause your soul mate is the person that pushes all your buttons, pisses you off on a regular basis and makes you face your shit. Catch a big one, boy. - Oh... - Oh! - Look how pretty that is - Wow. - lt is a fat one. - l catch a fish. Look-- look at that tail-- a little action. lt's not easy having a good marriage, but l don't want easy. Easy doesn't make you grow. Easy doesn't make you think. l thank God every day that l'm married to a man that makes me think. That's my definition of true love. - Ow! - How many is that? - Four. - No. Seven plus one is... - A lot. - A lot? - Did you want to cut it? - l need my fish back. Hospital for sick children, and l read a book to them. l read my mom's book ''The English Roses,'' and l passed out two other books that my mom wrote. But ''English Roses'' is about not seeing the big picture, - and not being like-- - Whatever. - Don't talk about this. - lf you-- okay, see, say, if l uh... if l looked at Yvonne and l thought... - ''She's--'' - Don't talk about this. ''She's so pretty and she's so popular, but like, l don't really know who the person who she is inside. And l don't really think--'' Oh, don't talk - about this! - Rocco! Don't yell at me! And she didn't have her mother. Her mother died. And-- and she like-- - she tried to make dinner like-- - Her mother died? What the heck are you talking about? That's very right! - You got your board in the water. - Lola! Go! Ow! Dude, don't burn me. - Angie, can you make me my shake? - Yeah. Chris Lamb is swearing it's gonna rain - in Dublin. - What kind of negative bullshit - is that? - Well, l guess when it rains-- - it rains really a lot. - Listen, it's not gonna rain, - okay? - No, it won't. And you better have rubber soles on all my shoes. l just can't wait to have a drink. 'Cause l hadn't had a drink in 20 weeks. 20 weeks! You just wait and see how much fun l'm gonna be. - Okay. - Whoo! Oh yeah! - See you fuckers at the party! - Whoo! Someone thought it would be funny to switch my shorts - during the show. - Yeah, l thought you had a good ass. Can you just walk away for us? - Work it, sir. Work it. - Yeah, Papi! We're gonna go to the Delano and have an ''orggy.'' We can have a metaphysical ''orggy.'' lt's where you just have an orggy for the sake of sharing. This is my first drink in 20 weeks. We're here in London having a great time. The prices are pretty high. The weather is kind of shitty, cloudy and rainy. These fuckers-- they don't like London. Tight, too stiff. l think they got something stuck up their ass. Uh, yeah... most of the time it's our fingers. l'll take this off and put that on. - Did you get this from Cher? - No! lt's actually a necklace. Oh, wow, it fits you. - You're so petite. - But-- yeah, right. - lt needs to be lower. - My thighs are the biggest part - of my body. - No, you are. - This is getting really stinky. - l've been washing it. - l put a dress shield in it too. - Dude, l'm spraying perfume on it. - This is her ltalian shower. - You don't have any body odor. My French horse bath. - Those big, fat ltalian thighs. - Oh, stop. - Do you think it looks good, Andy? - Uh-huh. No? See? lf two fags say no, you know you're in trouble. - Am l done? - Mm-hmm. l stink. l sprayed the hell out of it, but-- lt's hard to be that bad. Hallelujah. Come on, chop-chop. l can't breathe in there. - Oh, hair and makeup check. - Oh. - Oh, hell! - Okay. Nice, nice. - No way, it's funny. - That's what you think. - Nine and a half. - Chris, it's getting madly tense. - Oh, shit. - We need the door shut, and we need some silence. l thought we should have a very special treat, and ask Reshma to sing her beautiful song. - Yeah. - All right, okay. God, please take me from untruth to eternal truth, from deep darkness to eternal light. From great death, take me to Your sweet nectar. Lord, please protect and defend us, as we do Your work. Let our knowledge shine and become divine to the world. Let us never fight each other or become envious of each other, yet stay united together forever. - Amen. - Amen. - Band, please. - Come on, knock 'em dead, Stuart. - Watch out. - Play that axe, baby. Namaste, namaste. My dad was the one who always told me that my dancing would never get me anywhere in life. l was like, ''You know, other people have different dreams in their lives. l definitely have to follow mine, because otherwise, l'll be miserable.'' Fuck, it's so cold out here. - Gonna steal our fucking clothes. - Sniff them later. Thanks. Bye, Guy. l need a raise, and l'm not talking about money. Every time she changes costumes, she comes in here, takes off what she's wearing, puts on the new costume, refreshens, touches up. Usually, l try to meet her out where she's coming down on the lift and, like, have a flashlight. She can kinda see where she's going. The trick is you have to guide her. She has ear monitors in. So she's listening to that or she's thinking about something on stage. Sometimes you have to grab her and remind her that she has to sit down. You have a quick change. A lot of stress can develop in this room, or it can go very smoothly if everything's prepared. The funny thing is that people think that the show is on the stage, because that's where all the audience is. But the show is really in the quick change. One, two, three, four... lt's not easy being a rock star. ''Kabbalah'' come from the ancient word in Aramaic, ''lekabel,'' which is learning how to receive. Every action that you do, every thought that you inject, every energy that you release has a consequence. And when you understand this, you realize ''l would like to choose those thoughts or those behaviors of these certain ways of thinking that will plant seeds to create blessings, positive things versus chaos and negativity.'' Let's say l have less ups and downs in my life. l mean, l'm not gonna lie. l had some pretty good times throughout all of my life, but l also was kind of like... a spinning wheel in many respects. Life seemed to be a series of random events for me. Sometimes l was ecstatically happy and sometimes l was depressed. l seemed to be a bit more careless with people back in those days and not very nice. l don't miss being an idiot. l want to thank you guys for pulling the slack... l just feel like l know so much more than l ever did before. And sometimes l say to myself, ''What was l thinking before l was thinking?'' But l won't say that l didn't have any fun. But you know, sometimes fun is overrated. That was definitely the sweatiest show l ever did. We kept it together well. l actually had fun. l heard, ''Low costume. The shields need to be washed. Tony knows that.'' Yes, my corset really stinks. My monologues are getting longer and longer. That l've noticed. l'm just buying time, so l can catch my breath. This is what we call skanky hair. Should we call Guy? lt was really good, the best show yet. Mm-hmm. lt was great. Anyway, it's very quiet in your pub. You're the only ones in the pub? Okay, is that a half an hour in the real world or is that a half an hour in your world? Guy! Pubs close at 1 1 :00. They opened the pub for Guy. And that's why he didn't come to the show, not because-- he's such a bad liar. Why do boys even try to lie? You just want my booty on your lap. Hey! What do you think? - lt's full of iron. - Good for you. - No, this is nasty. - To you, baby. lt just tastes like dirty water. - Just about 25 minutes. - Oh, yuck. Should we do a sound check like normal? - Yeah, l think we should, yeah. - And it's not Alaska. Yeah, and since it's not raining now, we should start this. Please don't hurt yourself. You've got too many shows to do. Great. Come on, Siedah, sing it. One more time. l don't know the other words. Come on, everybody now. The best sound l've ever heard in my life. - See that sun? - That's gonna stay, ma'am. Yes. We've just gone from one extreme to the next-- boiling hot with fans on me in London, to ''l'm sure that Hydro's gonna be in the pit with some heaters.'' But l can take it, can't l? 'Cause l'm tough. They forgot about lggy. That's so cool. l hope he doesn't take a shit on my stage. 'Cause, you know, he likes to break glass and cut himself and set fire to things. So l'm gonna have to have a word with him. Hey hey hey. Hello! - lgnore my house. - Hey, thanks for having us. Thanks for doing this. l'm a huge fan of yours. Thanks for having us. This is really cool, yeah. - ls that all you're gonna wear? - That's all l'm gonna wear. - You're fucking crazy, man. - Yeah well, a little bit. l hope you plan on moving around a lot. - Yeah, yeah. - Okay, have a great show. - Thanks a lot for doing this. - Okay, thanks for having us. - Nice to meet you. - Okay okay. - Bye. - Yeah, have fun. - All right, cool. - Bye. Very cool. She doesn't mind sharing one minute on the little platform. l'm just asking God to delay the rain. Delay the rain till 1 1 :30. Just this one small thing. Please be safe. Do not do anything impulsive tonight. Watch each other's backs. Tap into your sixth sense. Take care of one another and take care of yourself. And most of all, have a great great show, amen. Amen! Oh, shit. This is my dream come true right here. Look at this. 80,000 people. Big castle in the background. A full moon that everyone says sailed over the stage as soon as l arrived. l felt so much love and joy and... l couldn't believe that the people in the audience just stood there for six hours in the rain and didn't move. But on the other hand, it was freezing cold. lt was raining off and on through the whole show. When l was singing ''Nothing Fails,'' l was outside the coverage of my stage and the rain was pelting me. And Hydro, God bless him, stuck up an umbrella. lt was so difficult to do my show. l felt like l was in a war zone. And l had to keep looking out for things, like slipping off of railings, sliding on the floor and jumping into puddles. l was constantly worried for the dancers. So l was kind of traumatized through the whole show. lntense, extreme. And then when the show ended, l don't remember what happened. l don't actually remember singing a song or doing a dance step. Well, l finally made it to a pub. Only it's not in lreland, it's in London. And the reason l never made it to a pub in lreland is 'cause my husband ditched me at the castle we were staying at. And when l came out of the bathroom, he was gone. We had a huge fight when he got home, and l didn't speak to him for 24 hours. But l moved on. This is called The Punchbowl. And we come here all the time. But tonight it's a special occasion 'cause it's Guy's birthday. Drinks on the house. Come in. l'm gonna pull a pint for you. ls that okay? Please, Mrs. Ritchie, you get in there and pour me a pint. George Best says, ''Watch your head.'' lt's not George Best, darling, it's Courage Best. You don't mind if there's a lot of foam, do you? Yes, l do. l care a lot about the foam. - There you are, love. - That is a perfect pint. Thank you very much, darling. She's great, the farmer's daughter. Do you know how many times l've heard these songs? l wanna go home. - Kiddy-widdy-winkies, come along. - Hi, Mom. - Did l get a good room, Roccs? - Yes. No, we've hit a dead end. - Oh my God. - No, that is not cool. Mom, do you think we can go in the sauna sometime? Did you see my bedroom? lt's the best bedroom ever. lt's actually not that fancy. - Oh, please. - lt's kind of a decadent-- lt's kind of like a mediocre hotel posing as a decadent hotel. - 'Cause who's the queen, Rocco? - You you you. Very good, very good. Let's go see where your rooms are. - Pick up your shoes. - ''We're not gonna leave our shoes.'' - Come on. - ''We're not gonna leave our shoes.'' We're going to Katia Labeque's house. She's a concert pianist. She lives with her sister Marielle. And l just wanted to give the band and the dancers a treat, 'cause, you know, they're used to going to discos and nightclubs and pubs and they might not even know what classical music is. How are you, ma cherie? So great to see you. - Sorry l'm late. This is Katia. - Hi. She's the hostess with the mostest. Where's my champagne? Hello. - Show time. - Okay, this is Katia and this is Marielle, and they're my favorite pianists in the whole world and two lovely girls, and we're so honored to be in their house. l thought it was good for them to see a number of artists performing from a different world. They got quite serious. And it was good for them to see passion and expression, but coming from a completely different sensibility. Thank you. lt was the best. Thank you so much. You're the best. - lsn't it great? - Thank you so much. lt was amazing. ls this the part where you feed me? - Yes. - Okay, great l'm starving. - Who's there? Hi, baby. Come. - Hi, Mom. - What's up with the bathing suit? - We're going to the pool, okay? - Wait, how was school today? - Good good good good. - How about a kiss and a hug? - Yeah. Yeah, don't sound so bored. l know. l'm not bored because l'm meeting Honor at the pool. - Wait, l have to ask you something. - Yes, Mom. 'Cause l'm gonna say it tonight on stage. How do you say... ''l'm going to tell you a secret''? Bye, love you, too. Have fun in the pool. Okay. l read my prayers. l read my Zohar. And then l read ''Gone With the Wind.'' Yes, that's how l get to sleep. l always read fiction. 'Cause that takes me out of the world that l'm in. But l always read the Zohar, which can also be very soothing, as a kind of decoding of the Torah or the Old Testament. So if you want to read things literally, you read the Old Testament, and if you want to understand the hidden meanings of the Torah, you read the Zohar. ''Rabbi Abba sat at the gate of the city Lod. He saw a man sitting on a ledge protruding from a mountainside. He was weary from the road, so he sat down and slept. While he was sleeping, he saw a snake coming toward him. A reptile emerged and killed the snake. When the man woke up, he saw the dead snake. He stood up and the ledge, which had been torn from the mountain, fell to the valley below. Thus, he was saved, for had he risen a moment later, he would have fallen together with the ledge into the valley and been killed. Rabbi Abba came to him and said, 'What have you done that the Holy One, blessed be He, performed for you two miracles?' And the man said, 'ln all my days l forgave and made peace with any man who did evil by me. Thus, l did not harbor hatred all that day for the harm he did me. Moreover, from that day on, l tried to do kindness by them.''' lt's the hardest thing in the world to do. l mean, can you imagine forgiving people that, you know, fuck you over? --for lack of a better word; To actually get to the end of your day and go, okay, we all have people that piss us off and make us angry and hurt our feelings-- but to get to the end of that day and not only forgive them, but to wish them well? - Monday, l return to London. - Yeah? They have a Royal Movement from 10:40 to 1 1 :20, and so we can't land during that slot, so l wanted to know - if you wanted to push up or back. - What is Royal Movement? That means either the Queen or one of her children are coming in and out, and we're not allowed to land. Did l say l wanted to leave at 1 1 :00? - You did. - l don't remember that. - What if we left at noon? - Fine. - Would that be even better? - That would be even better. And that's good for Royal Movement? There's not room for two queens in that country? Okay, people, we're just getting this party started! This is the no-sitting-down song, people over there in the seats. Come on, get up. l wanna see you dancing. Come on, put your hands together. Thank you. lt was a lot more calmer than l thought it was gonna be, you know? All the tours l hear about, l hear about sex, drugs, rock and roll, and everybody partying and going out. Double-dutch, booty clap. l don't really like wasting time going out and partying. l like to do something productive. And action! l don't care what l do. l'll work at a cafe. l worry about the dancers. l don't know what l'm gonna do after the tour. They're younger than everybody, and a lot of them, this is their first experience of, you know, seeing the world. l'm gonna call people in L.A. and hopefully get my own place and then start. Whatever happens happens. He's gonna move to L.A. and make sandcastles and put a hat out there. She influenced me and motivated me to try harder for my dreams. 'Cause the show is tiring as hell, especially for Madonna. l can only imagine. She's singing and dancing and doing all her shit. l really gotta shave. Bikini wax. Girl, you be looking bushy. Dancers don't get rich. We suck. Cloud, you suck. l want them to push themselves. Cloud is probably the most focused young man l've ever met in my life. l don't want them to accept mediocrity from the minute they leave my sight. Here l am, a skateboarder. l had no idea it was gonna be this great. Bam, right back-- right back to the crowd. l think there's a lot of sadness going on because some people after this, as far as the dancers, myself, we're like, ''Okay, what are we gonna do?'' l think a lot of people have become really good friends. Each and every one of them are beautiful people. We became one. That's what blows me away is everything just go-- One gigantic family. Bam, right back-- right back to the crowd. This light that we're supposed to be shining back, as Madonna says, we're doing it. We're getting fed by the crowd. The more we get fed by the crowd, the more we are giving back. Bam, right back-- right back to the crowd. Unified world love. And that's it. Oi! Oi! That's how they say ''hello'' here. - You look like Princess Leia. - Thank you. You didn't give me a birthday present. The picture of me and Cher? - That was not a present. - lt wasn't? - Well, let's get on with the program. - l just have a question. What's with the Princess Leia thing? ls that like... Oh, shit. See what you made me do, Gene? My bun came out. Wouldn't be the first time. Thank you. l'll be here all night. Waiter, waiter, there's a slug on my lettuce. Oh, don't worry, madam, we won't charge extra for that. - Knock knock. - Who's there? - Arthur. - Arthur who? Are there any more biscuits in the tin? Waiter, waiter, this coffee tastes like earth. That's because it was ground yesterday. - Knock knock. - Who's there? - Justin. - Justin who? Just in time for the party. - Who's there? - Wilma. - Wilma who? - Will my lunch be ready soon? l tell jokes and you don't laugh at them. You're my straight man. You're funniest when you're bollocking people. - l'm Jerry and you're Dean. - Yeah, but-- no, you've got to rant. What are you all standing around for? See, that's it. That's funny already. l'm sorry. l watched ''Star Wars,'' okay? l felt inspired. Okay, that's enough. Shh. Do you wanna go home, back to L.A., Rocco? Oh, no-- oh, yeah. Bye! We're only allowed to watch movies on Sunday, but sometimes Saturday night is our episode night, so we get to watch two episodes of something. Ooh, you're gonna take me on then? Okay, that's enough. So do you love... love, love your sister? - Let him go, stop. - l know you're gonna say no. l'm happy to go back to L.A. And l'm happy to see my friends, and l'm happy to get my mom back for me and only because l said so, and Rocco's not gonna have her at all. Because she's my mom. Even though she's Rocco's mom, too. And Rocco gets her all the time when she's on the tour, because he demands it. Hey. Thanks, Sarah. Bye. Why am l so tired? Today, it's just like, ''Okay.'' All l do is make mental checklists every five minutes. Who do l write thank you cards to, and what am l gonna say in the prayer and how am l gonna thank the crew during the show? l just gotta remember everything, everything and everyone, 'cause today is my last chance. Ah! One more show. l'm just sad. l couldn't have asked for anything better. lt was perfect. l'll miss having that mic up in my head, like a flying penis above me. Take it like Tony would. Come on. Take it like Tony would. l'm a top. She doesn't get it. l wrote you a letter. lt's not a letter. - lt's a poem. - lt's a poem, all right. l love poems. - Okay, don't laugh. - l'm not gonna laugh. ''You started your career before l was born. To dance for Madonna, who thought l'd be chosen? She took a chance on me to see lf l was funny as she thought l would be. The tour's almost over, with one show left, l guess that's the good thing 'cause the diva needs her rest. You rock the world one show at a time, And to you from me, Madonna, goodbye.'' Oh, Aries, that's beautiful. - You like? - l love it. All right, have a great last show, okay? Yes, thank you for helping me realize my dream. Oh, anytime. - Okay, l'll hold you to it. - Okay. - Hi. - Hi. - l have a present for you. - What? Um, it's a guitar. - And l wanted to thank you... - Oh, my-- ...for everything. - Thank you so much. - You're so welcome. - Oh my God, are you serious? - But you gotta promise me one thing. You're gonna write some good fucking music on it, okay? - l will. - And do something good with your life. - l hope so. - l think you're off to a good start. l have to get out of here before l cry. Okay, yeah, get out of here before l cry. - Thank you. - Sure. Today is the last show. Of course, about five minutes ago, l got my period. At least-- the only thing l can say about it - is that my boobs look great. - Yeah. See, l'm not on my period. Yeah, look at that. Yoo-hoo, yoo-hoo. Hello? David? Okay, for the next two hours l'm still fucking in charge. Now, get in a circle. That's right, that's right. This is the end... or the beginning, depending on how you look at it. lt's hard to believe that we finally reached this moment. When l think back to our rehearsal period and all the trials and tribulations, the blood, the sweat and the tears, it's hard to imagine that we've been through so much together, that we've accomplished so much. l thought about the looks on your faces when l said you had the job. l think about how happy l was to see Marlyn and Tamara again. And l thought about how l was sure that Zach was straight and Jason was gay. Oh, shit. l thought about how l thought Mihran was lranian, not Armenian. l remember Jamie telling me it would be a big mistake if l hired Aries 'cause he's too young and he would be too high maintenance, but l said, ''No, l gotta have him. He makes me laugh.'' lt's true. l thought about what a pain in the ass Dawn was gonna be asking to take her dog on the road. - Yes. - lt's true. l thought about Cloud and his amazing brilliance and uniqueness. And from the minute l saw him, l thought, ''l have to have him in my show.'' l thought about the beauty of Raistalla and Reshma. And l looked at Paul and said, ''How can one white man be so funky?'' You're right. l thought about when l cut Seth in New York and then l went out into the hallway and l saw him sobbing in the corner. l just thought, ''l have to hire him. l don't know why.'' Just... he wanted the job so bad. And of course l thought about... the talents of Serge and Lorne who come from such different worlds, but we are so blessed to have them here. Donna, thank you for doing it again. You've been with me the longest. And Siedah, how many years did we talk about working together? Ooh, l'm patient. And then there's my band, who l've worked with before, each and every one of them, and l'm so lucky to have you back again. And Stuart, please-- l mean, thank you. l mean, l couldn't have done it without you. l'm sorry l didn't get to hang out with you guys as much as l wanted to, but... l have another family and one day you will know... the pull of work and family, and the struggle to keep it all balanced. We've come so far, and everyone's become better at what they do. You're better musicians and you're better dancers, and you're better singers and you're better performers... But above all l hope that you go out into the world when this tour ends, and that you are more compassionate to other human beings and more responsible for your actions and your words, because without those two things your gifts and your talents mean nothing. l thank you and love you from the bottom of my heart. We love you too. We love you. One, two, three! They're living a fantasy right now: being on tour with Madonna, traveling, seeing the world, being loved by Madonna's fans. lt's a whole thing for them that l'm sure is very surreal, so l can understand that they would be sad, but they just need to remember this is a great experience. lt is about the moment, the experience-- you live it and then you move on. We love you, Madonna. We love you. We thank you. ln a parallel universe, the tour's only just begun. l'm gonna meet with the Prime Minister of lsrael. - l don't know what l'm gonna say. - lt doesn't matter. lt'll come to you. Hey, dude, l fucking have the balls to go there. You have to have the balls to go there. l'm fucking high profile. Yeah, you have more security than l do. l have so much security... l'm not bringing my children. - Good for you. You know what? - Yeah, that's a little freaky-- That's really good, that you're doing that. They would be stuck in the hotel rooms. lt's gonna be an adventure. Um, l wanted to say, thank you all once again from the bottom of my heart, um... for this unbelievable experience. And l just had one more thing that l wanted to say. - Glasses. - Um... thank you. Where's Angie? This is my present to you. l've written a poem. All right, here-- here goes. ''Some secrets, they are better left unsaid, Or in this case, much better when they're read. l'm known to write a witty verse or two Regarding things important and/or true, But now l'm creeping 'round like a tarantula Just looking for some words that rhyme with 'Angela.' You see me dancing 'round up there each night, And belting out my songs with all my might. l'm showered with affection and applause, But here is where l'd like you to take a pause For somewhere in the back, in a small nook, ls Angie, staring at her Powerbook. She's sorting out what l will eat and wear. The luggage, planes and cars are in her care. She's gathering my icepacks and my shake, And picking up debris left in my wake. She chases barking dogs away at night And when something is wrong, She makes it right. She does her job with elegance and grace, And when she's down, she puts on her best face. l've seen her deal with every kind of jerk, And when we're all asleep, she's still at work. The secret must be told, and l'm insistent: The real star of my show ls my assistant.'' l love you so much. You take care of your crazy self, all right? - l love you. You love me? - l-- l-- What is up with you, you weirdo? Well, l think l have to go now. Stuart, l gotta go. l know. l'm just finishing up here. l-- Stuart! Ow! Who's the daddy? Who's gonna have a black eye tomorrow? l think l'm blind in my right eye. l don't-- don't say goodbye. This isn't the end. l know. Wait, my hand's stuck in Stuart's ass. - What's going on up here? - Here you go, ma'am. Oh, dear. - l'll see you all bright and early. - Oh, you will, ma'am. Hey, l've got an idea. Let's go to lsrael tomorrow. - Let's go, let's go. - Excellent. Okay, l have a huge ego and l need to do something about it. And l need to change. And how can l change? The only way l can change is to constantly work at it. And l need to change. And how can l change? Knowing is the beginning. Knowing more and learning more and achieving more. The minute you stop wanting to know more, that's when you stop growing. And that's when you die. And that's when-- that's when you're nothing. A touchdown at Tel Aviv is hardly a step straight back into history because-- What is going on? ''lt is my delight and pleasure to welcome you to lsrael and to David lnter-Continental Hotel.'' Look at this. This is the hookup, okay? And a bit of kosher champagne-- not. - The view is so beautiful. Oh my God. - The view of what, Rachel? ''Excitement that your visit has generated throughout the country is truly heartwarming, not only as ambassadors of good will, but showing the kind of solidarity that has been sorely lacking in these past few years, choosing... the Jewish high holidays''-- That's not why l am here. Today, which is the first day of Rosh Hashanah, we have the opportunity to eliminate negative consciousness that usually would create the destiny and the future for the coming year. ln the Catholic church, you say to the priest, ''Bless me, Father, for l have sinned,'' and then the priest says, ''l absolve you of your sins. Say three Hail Marys and four Our Fathers, and get the fuck out of here.'' l mean, that's not work. Rosh Hashanah is the time where you can reflect back on the whole year and try to find every area where you short-circuited or caused chaos in someone's life. You have to go through the year and be perfectly honest with yourself and say, ''Okay, where did l fuck up?'' And to me that's like the real version of confession. What the Cabbalah teaches is essentially what Jesus teaches, which is to love your neighbor as yourself. But l keep forgetting it every time somebody pisses me off. So far, Cabbalah is the only thing that has worked for me. All the solutions, all the answers, all the fulfillment are right here. What's missing is to remove the blindfolds, which-- those are our negativities. One shell can be a person is major victim. Another shell can be major selfishness. Another shell can be major ego. Another shell can be, ''l don't believe l can do it.'' These shells that are blocking us from connecting to the light. The world is filled with chaos-- personal chaos and global chaos-- famine, crime, hatred, pollution. When you come to a dark room, you want to eliminate the darkness, turn on the light. What we need to talk about is - the Rachel Tomb... - Yeah? ...which is actually in the Occupied Territory. - Right. - We cannot go in armed. The police doesn't escort us. lt's only the army. - What if we just go in like on a-- - We can't. The police is not giving us authority to go through-- - as of security. - Oh, they're telling us we're not allowed to go? So how do they go to get the red string? They go in groups, once the army tells them that they can go in. But as of our visit for tonight, the police is not allowing us to go in there. l know that it's possible. You're just saying tonight they're not giving us access? The police said no-- a complete no. We've been given blanket protection by the police. Uh-huh. What if l just went with a group of people and l was incognito - and l changed the way l look... - No. ...and l wear a wig and my identity-- and l didn't go as me? - But it's still not safe. - This is going to an Occupied Territory, which is described as a war zone. - We can't carry firearms-- - All of lsrael is described - as a war zone. - 21 people were blown up three years ago. lt is a war zone. Danny the security guard said that it's more dangerous in New York. Just to let you know. They said we can't go. l don't wanna get killed. l don't want you to get killed. - They're warning us. - Well, God forbid. This is their country. They're telling us and giving us advice - that we should really listen to. - Okay. - Fine. - All right, l'm sorry for that, - but uh... - l'll get you back. - Thank you. - Okay. Fuckers. Pussy fuckers. l'm going to Rachel's Tomb anyways. We have the coverage of the national police. l understand that l don't have police leading me out. Danny, we go on that street... - we make a right, that's it. - Okay, you're... Let's get arranged. People know that she's here. lt would be easy for them, if l was an Arab terrorist, to hit a target like her. There is not a lot of places in the world that World War lll can start. This is one of them. - Ashlag tomb is fine. - When you go inside of it, - it's private? - Uh-huh. Okay. Some people go to the street corner where Jim Morrison died, and other people go to Graceland to touch the gates where Elvis Presley used to live. l chose to go to the grave of the Rav Ashlag because he was an amazing human being and an incredible teacher. What are these guys doing in here? - They have to go. - No. No. - No no no. - No photographers. They're such liars. They were cleared by who? - Can you be there? - Yes, l'm going here. Rav Ashlag says that the perfection of humanity already exists. Our job is to lift the veils that make us think that it doesn't. We don't have to create something out of nothing. We just have to reveal what's already there. Hey hey hey hey hey! l thought this was private. l thought when you said we came in, no one was gonna come in. The only thing that's gonna change the world is spirituality, not politics. Politics go whichever way the wind blows. Politics doesn't offer any real solutions to people. Eitan asked us to close our eyes and meditate on one personal wish that we had, one way where we could effect change in the world. l don't know what happened to me. l just closed my eyes and started to cry. This could be better if she come out of the window, give us two pictures and-- You said one was enough. Now you want two from the windows. Princess Madonna. Strange that the police walked with the lady, but this is the power of the Cabbalah, yes? l know that people think l'm-- l'm a nut sometimes or they think l've joined a cult, or they think l'm mad or whatever, but l don't care 'cause they thought all those things anyways. l used to be in a cult. lt's called the cult of life. And like all cults, you're not encouraged to have a voice, you're not allowed to ask questions. And if you do, you're not gonna get a straight answer. l don't wanna be in that cult anymore. l'm the director of a peace center where our main goal is to put Jews and Arabs together. Although it is very painful, because of the long lsraeli/Arab conflict, l do believe that peace will come one day to our country. We almost studied every subject in this world. We invaded this space. We went down in the ground, looking for treasures. Unfortunately, we did not bother enough to learn peace, to study peace. She can do a lot in my opinion as a woman of the world. We need her help badly. lsrael, according to the Zohar, is the energy center of the world. The energy in lsrael is more powerful than anywhere else in the world. That's why there's so much conflict there. That's why there's so much war and suffering. And the idea is that with this collective consciousness of 3,000 people, we can change the energy of lsrael. lf you can change the way people think there, then you can change the way people think in the rest of the world. First of all, l would like to say how happy l am to be back in lsrael. l couldn't think of a better place to end my tour, and l promise not to stay away for another 10 years. lt is also important that all of you know that l am not here representing a religion. l'm here as a student of Cabbalah. ln Cabbalah, we learn that if we want something in life, we have to give something. lf we want compassion, we have to give compassion. lf we want tolerance, we have to give tolerance. lf we don't want to be judged, then we must not judge. At SFK, we teach children to never think in a limited way. And these children learn that they have the power to make miracles happen. One day these children will grow up and they will not want violence. They will not want war. They will want peace. We teach children what we are trying to learn as adults. But the difference is that children are more open, they are more alive and they do not see the world in a fragmented way. They're not thinking, ''Oh, he's a Muslim,'' or, ''She's a Jew.'' They do not judge one another by the color of their skin or the style of their headdress. Sometimes it's hard to look out into the big bad world and feel a burning desire to help your fellow man. But maybe if you look at it through the eyes of a child, you will feel a tugging at your heart. Maybe you will want to give them a better future and maybe, just maybe, you will then have the urge to make the world a better place yourself. So l'm here to ask this one question-- What are you waiting for? When you look at the destruction of the world through the eyes of children, sometimes it can make people wake up more. The forces of darkness are powerful. The worst peace is better than the best war. lt is time now to begin to spread light and hope. lf more people light more candles, they will make the darkness less dark. We need to exchange ideas. We need to know more about each other. We need love. Without love, l don't think there would be life. Now do you understand my secret?
