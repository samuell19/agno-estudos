Every action you take has the possibility of upsetting someone. Don't carelessly get too close to people. And don't challenge their opinions. That way, you won't hurt anyone or get hurt by someone you may have hurt. So you end up protecting yourself. That is the theme I live by. Using military force to obtain peace… That's why, the first time I saw Akiyoshi Hisano, I made fun of her to myself. Excuse me, may I ask a question? I will take questions later. Now is fine too. I don't think violence is ever needed. What? When has violence ever solved anything? As long as human beings exist, there will be conflict. Violence is always behind peace. That's not right. There could be peace behind peace. Everybody wants peace. Even in the middle of a war, it's possible for everyone to share the same view. She's what you'd call an idealist. I was surprised to find someone so foolishly overconfident and clueless in this world. So if everyone truly wished for it, we could put an end to war. If it were that easy, this class wouldn't exist. But-- Unfortunately, we're out of time. That's it for today. The reason I looked over at her was to enjoy seeing someone get mad after having their stupid idea rejected. But I was surprised. She looked hurt. I'm sure I was drawn to her expression then. But by drawn to I mean it was on the level of hearing some slightly different music on the street. Voices unrelated to me are just noise that blend into the background. Are you alone? Hmm? Weren't you in my class earlier? Can I join you? M-Me? Yeah. Is it okay? Yes, please have a seat. No need to be so formal. Are you a freshman? Wait, are you older than me? I'm a freshman. Thank goodness. You scared me. I thought I just put my foot in my mouth. I'm Akiyoshi Hisano. What's your name? I'm Tabata. Tabata what? Kaede. Is that the character for maple? Yeah. Kaede and Akiyoshi. Our names are both related to autumn! Were any of your classes interesting? Not particularly. What about clubs? I'm not joining any. I see. I can't decide which one to join. I'm interested in Model UN. You play the part of delegates and have debates like the UN. Like about global warming or environmental issues. Do you want to go check it out with me? No, thanks. Sorry. There's nothing wrong with it. I must sound like I'm trying to recruit you into a cult. I need to go. My next class is a bit far away. Okay, see you later. Yeah. Later. There won't be a later. Someone like her who can talk to anyone will quickly find someone better to talk to. She'll forget all about me since she only talked to me because I was the only one around. Good morning. That's what I thought anyway. Good morning! I didn't know you were in this class too. What? May I ask a question? Of course. You are paying tuition after all. I believe war would end if everyone puts their weapons down at the same time. That's idealistic. It's not realistic. Shouldn't we be striving for the ideal? Can't they resolve… She's not just some cringey person. She's the real deal. Someone you can't get involved with. How can I avoid her? I've read the textbook. For now, I decided… LECTURE ROOM …to run away. Tabata! Are you having lunch? What should we have? Kaede? Aren't you going to eat? No. No, I'm eating. Before I knew it, a month had passed. I wasn't the type of person who could push someone away from me. As a result, people started whispering about me too. I'm really worried that I can't decide what club to join. Yeah. How was the Model UN? It's not what I imagined. I went and sat in on over ten clubs. Ten? Yeah, I didn't really fit into any of them. Am I being bullied? What do you want to do? To make the world a better place. If that's what you want, just make your own then. What? Come on. Let's do it together. Let's make something we can both accept. We can set the club activity to be really general. But I want something with commitment. At least have a solid mission. We'll only do what you want. I don't like standing out. In that case, we can make it like a secret society. A secret society? What? You know, we can both propose some ambitions to each other. What ambitions? To become the person I want to be. How can you say something like that and not be embarrassed? It's a common thought. Not for me. Everyone has a version of themselves they want to be. It's like a motto or a theme. Theme? Yeah, like their life's theme. Like never lying or bragging. You must have something like that. Like never wasting food or littering. I wasn't sure if I could share it with her. What pushed me was the thought that I'd get my peaceful life back once I fully disgusted her. To not get too close to people. And to never challenge their opinions. That way, you won't ever hurt someone or get hurt by someone you hurt. I bet Akiyoshi looks disgusted after hearing that. That's so kind. What? That means you don't want to hurt anyone, right? I think it's amazing to think that way. What should we name our secret society? Oh! Moai? Secret Society Moai. Not bad, right? We're Moai! Please join! We're Moai! Please join! We're Moai! Please join! We're Moai! Please join! We're Moai! Please join! Thank you very much! Secret society? So cringe. What the hell is this? Save the world? Is she serious? "Become the person you want to be" is so cringey. BECOME THE PERSON YOU WANT TO BE! JOIN NOW AND COME CHANGE THE WORLD We're Moai! Please join! We're Moai! Please join! We're Moai! Please join! Oh, we're Moai! Please join! We're Moai! Please join! This is really crazy. Secret Society Moai will change the world! I can still remember Akiyoshi smiling. Even though she's not here anymore. We, here at Moai, will change the world. We connect with people working on the front lines of society to guide ourselves to a new stage. Just fill this out. THREE YEARS LATER And the career declaration form. -Okay. Congratulations on your job offer. -Thank you. Have you become the person you want to be? You will surely be able to change the world by having meaningful interactions with key individuals, and not just with your school alumni. I'm about to start, Akiyoshi. Why don't you join us and change the world and yourself? Become the person you want to be. -Cheers. -Cheers. We're going to be wearing business suits by this time next year. I can't believe it. It's not even possible. Whatever, today we're here to eat and drink. There they are. It's Moai. Hello! I guess this is Moai's hangout spot. Do you want to go? No way. We're going to keep drinking until they leave. I'm not losing to those guys. Those hypocrites telling us to be who we want to be. They're just networking to get into good companies. Kissing the asses of all those corporate suits. But they go around acting like they represent the school. They're a drinking club. It's a bullshit club. Listen to you, Tosuke. I'm serious. Everyone's saying it. Those pretentious hypocrites. I really can't stand them. Wanna take them down together then? That's a good idea. How about we destroy them as our last hurrah in university? No, I'm serious. I'm seriously thinking about destroying Moai. What do you mean? The thing is, I actually created Moai. What? More accurately, it was me and one other person. I made it with a friend who's not here anymore. Not here anymore? She died. -Cheers! -Cheers! I'm just so frustrated. I thought there must be something I can do in her memory. I'm going to destroy the current Moai and rebuild it to the way it should be. I see. I like it. I'll help. Really? I like stuff like this. A small team standing up to a great evil. You know, I'm getting excited. -Yeah! -Yeah! I wanted to make Akiyoshi's lie a reality. To make Akiyoshi's ideals a reality. Hurry! It's over here! Hold on. Are you sure we're allowed to do this? It's fine. They weren't planning on using it for a while anyway. MOAI It's done! Starting today, this is Moai's secret base. Secret base? Yeah! A secret society needs a secret base, right? Let's commemorate this big moment. There's something I forgot to ask Akiyoshi. MOAI'S ASPIRATIONS I wonder who it was that Akiyoshi wanted to be. What about this? I'm sure she had many versions of who she wanted to become. -Here. -Thanks. There was too much she wanted to do. So bitter! What? You're kidding. That's why I'm sure. That's bitter! People are staring at us. Akiyoshi really believed that we could someday stop war by ourselves. At some point, even I started to believe these naive ideals weren't so bad. Moai Man is here! Violence never solves anything. Let's strive for peace together! And so the world became a little more peaceful than before. KID'S CAFETERIA THEATER -Akiyoshi. -Yeah? What are you thinking Moai should ultimately do? What? You know. Achieve world peace, eradicate war, abolish racial discrimination. I've heard you say that a hundred times now. What is that, anyway? What? Stepping on the white lines. You don't know? If you only step on the white lines, your wish will come true. That's why every time I cross a crosswalk, the world gets more peaceful. Even with local volunteer work, if you do what you can around you, even you or I could change the world. Right? I can't do that. That's not true. So… If anything happens to me, you have to carry on Moai's mission. What do you mean? What was that? I still haven't carried out the role Akiyoshi charged me with. Long time no see. Morning. I seriously haven't! -I swear! -Yay! You guys suck! Kaede! Hey. "Come meet knowledge and creativity. Hone yourself by interacting with members of society on the front line." Exchange meeting? It's just job networking. It's basically a sordid group date between companies and Moai. A gross gathering filled with self-interest. There are bad rumors going around about Moai's exchanges. The fastest way to attack them is probably making them viral. We find the dirt and expose them. Yeah. Could we infiltrate their exchange? Okay, I'll go. One of my classmates is in Moai. I'll ask them. It'll be less suspicious. You have a classmate in Moai? She's a third-year, but she basically never participates. A girl? Wait, are you trying to get with her? I'm not! You totally are. Whoa. He touched her shoulder. -That's gross. -Bye. I know her from work. She's freshman. -For real? -Yeah. Are you with Moai too? No, we're not in Moai. Oh, this is Kawahara. This is my friend Tosuke. -Hi. -Hi. Actually, Tosuke has his eyes on a girl in Moai. So we came to check her out. Right? What? Oh, right. What's Moai like? Hmm? I was invited and I just listened to their presentation. It's not some weird cult, right? I don't really know much about it either. But I hear it's useful for job hunting. Seems that way. That's what everyone tells me. But it's kind of sad to join a club for job hunting. So I have my eyes on a girl? God, people like that just get under my skin. Looks like I'm up. I hope things work out with her. I told you I don't have a thing for her. Sure. MOAI EXCHANGE EVENT Tosuke! Hey. Sorry to bother you like this. It's fine. It's about time for me to start job hunting anyway. But I thought you already got a job offer. Are you looking to upgrade? I'm just thinking about the future. It never hurts to network more. Network… TABATA KAEDE "She's totally your type." Tosuke? We should go. Right. -Okay. -Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. "I'm in. This is super high-quality." I'm pleased to welcome you to the 12th Moai Exchange Event. Finance, trade, the media. From manufacturers to the government. Our members of society working on the front lines, and all the students from the 13 universities who carry the future of Japan on their shoulders. We call this type of event "hierarchical friction" here in Moai, and I would like all of you students to experience it yourselves. Listen to me drone on and on. Now, let's get this started. Let the exchange begin! Businesses often say, "Welcome." Do you know why we do this? I believe what's important is being flexible. That will… You need steadfast opinions, or you can't multi-task when society demands it. What's key is how you can make adjustments. I get what you're saying. Your feelings are always important. Is everyone implying that what's important to you is what the companies are seeking? What's important is to not just be a cog. Think of it as a meaningful friendship. I see. What do you think? What? Me? I… "They're so pretentious, it's annoying." I heard he bagged another girl. Again? Jeez. He likes to hit on girls at these exchanges. He counts on the barbecues. -What? -You didn't know? He invites the girls from the exchange to the barbecue and has his way with them. That's awful! He'll offer to call someone connected and seduces them and tosses them. He's the worst! Yeah, he is. Hey, did you see the girl at the exchange? Who? The pretty one? Yeah! She's definitely next! Yikes. I bet she's his type. Ten… "The best BBQ!" Hey, do you know someone named Ten? Ten? Ten's-- Over there. Okay, then. We'll start the second half after a 15-minute break. The theme for the second half is "Become the person you want to be." Let's all make this a rousing discussion. "Ten is the best!" MAEKAWA TOSUKE Beginning pursuit. Copy that. Okay. Good work today, Mr. Kawashima. -Sorry to bother you. -It was nothing. Are you nervous? -There you are. -Long time no see! You came. Thank you. You should check out the talks. Sorry, sorry. Sorry, excuse me. Good work. Excuse me, sorry to keep you waiting. I'm Okamoto from Para Home. Mr. Okamoto. AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY Sneaking in. Excuse me. Can I help you? Oh, um. Is the host here? Ten is in the back in a meeting at the moment. Can I wait here? Sorry, this is only for Moai members. I really have to talk to Ten. I see, but-- -I know a member. -Could you wait out-- Tosuke? What are you doing? Pon. Yeah? I wanted to speak with Ten about something. Are you networking? You're a real go-getter. Um-- I'm Honda. I basically never show up for activities. She's a member, so I'll wait for him with her. I didn't know you were so diligent. I thought you'd hate it. No, I do hate it. But it might be useful when I get out into the real world. LIST OF MOAI BUSINESS PARTNERS That's easy to understand. Who are you again? Hey! Pon! Long time no see! It's been a while. Come to these exchanges more. -I'll do my best. -Okay? Right. So-- I heard you wanted to talk to me. Yeah. What is it? Thank you! I didn't think these exchanges would be this amazing. Hierarchical friction? That was good! I'm Tosuke Maekawa. Thanks. So what did you want to talk about? Well, it was more like to say thank you. Tosuke. Networking. Right! Networking! I wanted to network and-- Hey, this-- Right. I wanted to build a network! By networking-- I knew it. Look! I've got the same phone case! We match! But you're right, Tosuke. We should talk more later. Can I get your contact info? Yeah, of course. Huh? Tabata? I thought that was you. Long time no see. Long time no see. What are you doing here? -Want to pop in on the exchange? -No. I have somewhere to be after this. Okay. Excuse me. Sure. I will never forgive the thing that drove Akiyoshi from this world. I know that if we could start over… Alright, okay. -Thanks, that's a big help. -Don't mention it. This will drive the crows away. Yes. Okay, let's get back to work! Everyone come down. Let's get back to work. Is there anything I should watch out for? Just keep interacting with them. They just had a hard time fitting into school. This is where they can belong. Okay. Well then. How amazing! You did such a good job. Let's water it too. I'll bring water. So if you do that, it equals x. What? I don't get it at all. Simultaneous equations will never make sense. Look at the time. We're done. Good work. What's that? -This? -Yeah. You've got a lot of free time. Yeah. People are going to call you useless. You have to be useful to be a part of this world. What? My junior-high teacher said so. "At this rate, you're going to become a useless person." If that's the case, every college student is a useless person with time on their hands. Hey, you guys are called Moai, right? Yeah. What do you do in Moai? Well, we're going to change the world. What? Tutoring me isn't going to change the world. It will. I know the world will change. So annoying. MOAI The kids at the free school sent these. Oh, wow! The potatoes are huge! That's amazing. Tomatoes. The cucumber's huge! TO SECRET SOCIETY MOAI "I mastered simultaneous equations." This is the first step for Moai as we strive for world peace. Delicious. It's delicious! Excuse me. May I come in? Yes. Over here. I started to think that I could never solve any of the world's problems if I was holed up in a lab. Shouting at the moon to do something about it. Oh. But the moon has strange magic. -Why does the moon-- -Um, Waki-- -It's Wakisaka. -Um, Wakisaka. You're at the grad school's lab? Yeah. And? I'm studying social welfare in grad school. But I'm in a slump. Then I saw what you guys were doing. I thought that was it. You know. I started to think that change happens where you're having fun. Moai will change the world. But it won't change at this rate. If you really want to change the world, you need to aim for a bigger organization. You guys need to showcase yourselves to the outside world. You can shout at the moon. I remember every time summer comes I remember every time summer comes That girl eaten by a shark That poor girl On that beach with white splashes She left her red sandals That girl eaten by a shark That poor girl Over the blue ocean The sun sets Was she really eaten by a shark Was she really eaten by a shark Nobody knows Nobody knows I remember every time summer comes I remember every time I come to the island That girl eaten by a shark That poor girl On that quiet… There we go. Sorry, Tabata. Hup. Sorry. My goodness. I didn't think it'd be this much work. But I'm glad I came. I'm really grateful to you guys. I didn't do anything. It's all Akiyoshi. She's amazing. It keeps growing. I'm sure Moai is going to grow bigger and bigger. I've got vegetables. Thank you. -Here. -The drinks. You sure? -I got it. -I'm letting go. -Are you okay? -Help! Thanks. Thank you. -Want me to cook? -Please! We have cold drinks, too! FRIED NOODLES Thank you. Kaede. You should eat some too. I think it came out pretty well. Okay, I'll have some. Mr. Ohashi. Your band was great. That was amazing. I was really surprised. But the best part was seeing you up there having fun. I was so relieved. That was good. What do you think about Moai? What do you mean? You know, a lot's changed since Wakisaka joined. Won't you come to school? The whole class is looking forward to your return. You don't need to worry. I'll keep an eye out for you. You can't run away forever. You have to change. Our numbers have grown, our activities are expanding. And more people at school have heard of us. It looks to me like you're having fun. That's not the point. I'm wondering if Moai is what you want it to be. Is this what you really want? You can't stay here forever. I'm saying this for your own sake. We created Moai together. So if this isn't what you imagined, I want you to tell me. You know things can't stay this way. If you don't like this, I'm open to changing things. I-- You have to change. You have to change yourself. No! Nishiyama! I don't hate it or feel anything like that. What? Well, if you're fine with it, then I'm fine with it, too. Yeah. Nishiyama! Nishiyama! Wait! Wait! Hold on! Nishiyama! Wait, stop. Nishiyama! Come on. What are you doing?! Nishiyama. You have to try! You'll have to live your life with people calling you useless! Is that what you want? Kaede! Kaede! Are you okay? Kaede! Somebody! Somebody, help! -Are you okay? -Yeah. Get the first aid kit. -Are you okay? -I'm fine. That guy deserved to get hit. But you can't change the world with violence. That's so annoying. Phew. -You don't need to go? -Huh? She'll be taken. One more time. You like her, don't you? She's just a friend. Or I guess, more like a colleague. So, did the world change? We have more members. Moai is steadily changing the world. I see, so the world's changing. I guess I can't stay here forever. You don't need to rush things. College hasn't helped me find anything yet either. So you still have all that free time. Yeah. All this free time and I'm still useless. Kaede! Oh, great Moon! Please give me strength! Hear me! Oh, great Moon! Hey! Please answer if you hear me! Can you hear me? Hold on. You're leaving? I wanted to talk-- Yeah, I heard you're dating. You knew. Are you surprised? Well, I figured it happens. That's it? No, I'm surprised. I'm surprised you were interested in that sort of thing. What did you think I was? Yeah. Okay, bye. Those were the last words I ever said to her. Is this what job hunting is? I'm going to die before I even reach my senior year! Look at all these companies they're connected to. I thought my heart was going to explode. This was an amazing find. And I was invited to Ten's barbecue. -Really? -It's not Moai-related, so you can come. That's it. What? Okay, I'll go too. Wanna invite Pon, too? Don't worry, I won't tell her you've got a thing for her. I told you I don't. She has a boyfriend. A boyfriend back home. Sure. Anyway, about Ten's barbecue. Apparently, it's super shady. He invites the girls he checked out at the exchange and I heard he does whatever he wants to them. Really? Ten's a bastard. To him, Moai's just a place to lure women. Moai would suffer a big blow if word got out. So we're going to film proof. One, two, cheers! Cheers! Yeah! Cheers! You better believe I'm going to eat. Honestly! I wonder who he's targeting. It doesn't matter to animals like him. -Wow. -Oh, Tabata? I'm surprised to see you here. I'm surprised to see you here, too. Well, I joined Moai. You joined? Some people are actually doing community work, which is nice. I see. You know, Tosuke. This is his friend, Pon. Nice to meet you. I'm in Moai too, although I never attend. I'm Kawahara. Nice to meet you. Tosuke, Pon. You came. Hey, let me introduce you to Kaede. He's an econ major with me. -Hello. -I'm Ten. Thanks for coming. So many people came. I just know a lot of people. Can I get your contact info for next time? I like doing it up front. Is that cool with you? Yeah, sure, no problem. Here's me. Okay. Thanks. -Here. -Thanks. So I'll let you know when something comes up next. Hello, this is Ten. Really? Okay. I'll come get you. Okay. See ya. Sorry, I'll be right back. Bye-bye. People like him really exist. When you're that sociable, it's actually a negative. I know it's hot! Open wide! So that's the rumored harem. I know that was a bad picture. Promise to delete it. Yuka, can I talk to you? Oh, okay. Let's go. Say cheese! Yeah, yeah! Let's look. Did you get it? Where are the others? I kind of just ended up alone. So cute! Whoa! What year are you? No! This is my friend's friend. What? -You don't like those types, right? -Thank you. It's fine. You don't need to be so formal with me. I don't like that sort of stuff. Oh, let me. Thanks. How was the exchange? It looked like you got to talk a lot. I'm glad I went. I guess I got a clear picture of what I wanted to do. I really want to work in the media. That's good. I'll introduce you to someone with connections. You can ask them about it. Really? Yay. You know, I want to do anything I can for you. Here we go! Keep going! Huh? Ten! Have you seen Tosuke and Tabata? Pon! No, I haven't. Tosuke? -Whoa! -What? What? Oh. Did I interrupt something? Excuse me then. What's wrong with her? What's going on? Try again, Ten! Please! Go. -Whoa! He did it! -I like you! Let's go out. Nice one! Wait. I'm sorry. -What? -I have a crush on someone. Hold on. They're coming here. -It's fine, keep filming. -Then I'll wait for you! -It's fine. -Sorry! -Hold on! -Really? Wait a second! So-- What the hell? When I fall for someone, I lose sight of myself. I just go out of control and scare them away. What the hell's my problem? Honestly, I'm surprised. Surprised? Come on. Everyone thinks I'm a playboy, but I can't date people I don't like. I wouldn't want to. But not having someone you like like you back… That's sad. Ten. You feel me, Tosuke? Yeah. Ten! Your idol said she's coming! Akiyoshi is finally here. Oh. Have you met Akiyoshi? Akiyoshi? Moai's leader. I'll introduce you. Where are you going? Hey, Kaede. It's her, right? The one who-- Yeah, it's her. -Hey. -Tosuke! The thing is, I actually created Moai. I made it with a friend who's not here anymore. Not here anymore? She died. Akiyoshi Hisano. She took the real Moai away from me. Are you the person you want to be? Akiyoshi tricked me. What did she tell me? Secret Society Moai will change the world! Liar! Ideals? Change the world? Liar! Liar, liar, liar. Liar! The only one who can make Akiyoshi's lies real… the one who can do that is only me. MOAI "Wakisaka is so cool!" FOR SECRET SOCIETY MOAI BECOME THE PERSON YOU WANT TO BE! LURE WOMEN AT EXCHANGES JOIN THE SELF-SERVING CLUB MOAI JOIN THE SELF-SERVING CLUB MOAI Who the hell did this? They're going to hell! It's just paper. Just pictures. But people will run with stuff like this. And one day, this will be the truth. But these are lies, right? Then we have nothing to fear. Okay, let's get this cleaned up. Okay. Okay. Gather them all here. Trash bags! -Kawahara. -Yes? Do you have some? Let's put them in together. Hey there, Mr. Octopus! What are you doing over there? -Hello. -Hello. -Want some takoyaki? -It's takoyaki! Hey, what did you do to it? Sorry, I suck at this, but I'm doing my best. Okay. Long time no see, Mizuki! Hold on. Eat this. What? What's this? It's a mess. Thanks. It's surprisingly good. Thank goodness. Oh. We're having a concert today. Come check us out. This is my band. THE USELESS LIVE The Useless. I'm definitely coming. Is he here today? That useless guy? We don't work together anymore. I'm thinking about going to college. After I get my high school diploma. That's great. I mean, I missed three years of school. I don't know if I can. But I thought I'd try to change the world, too. Yeah. -See ya then. -Yeah. I ruined it again. It's fine! Let me see it. Sorry. Hey. Why don't you have a boyfriend, Kawahara? Um, why? I figured you'd meet a lot of guys in Moai. I guess there are some people like that. I should've attended more Moai events. Moai isn't for hookups. Right, Kawahara? I heard you had trouble. Something about getting covered in flyers. It's fine. People laughing from their safe spaces are trash. Moai has Akiyoshi. Akiyoshi? Who's that again? Moai's leader. She also created Moai. Created? What's she like? She seriously thinks we can change the world. The world? If everyone becomes who they want to be and does good things, Akiyoshi believes that one day, war, discrimination, and poverty will disappear. I think actually dedicating yourself to such a naive idea is amazing. People like us can go floating through life because there are people like her in the world. Kaede. It's your phone. Okay. -You can answer it. -What? No. It's just a telemarketer. AKIYOSHI HISANO Seems fishy. I bet it's an ex. No way. Did you know? This guy's been hanging out with Ten lately. What? I mean, we've just been drinking a few times. I couldn't say no. These playboys are on the same wavelength. I'm not a playboy. Wait. Ten isn't one either. He may look like a playboy, but he's really passionate. Oh, please eat. You didn't eat very much. Thank you. Why are you always speaking formally? It just feels so distant coming from you. Right? I don't mind. You know, once you lose the formalities, you'll see change. Come on, just try it one time. Sorry, I need to go catch my last train. Thank you for today. You're leaving already, Kawahara? You can continue speaking formally with me, Tabata. What? The reason why you speak formally is because that's the distance you measured. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. There's not. There really isn't. I do that too. Right. But aren't you forcing it a little? Always laughing with everyone? I'm not forcing anything. There's the me who drinks and laughs, the me who's in a long-distance relationship-- I'm completely different with other people, too. I'm sure there's like 100 different versions of me. But they're all the real me. I really did it this time. I'll be sure to apologize later. To both Pon and Tosuke. I'm sure those two will be okay. I'm probably just jealous. Pon is able to embrace so many sides of herself. I'm very stubborn. I cling to this idea of who I truly am. This is far enough. Okay, take care. VOICE MESSAGES AKIYOSHI HISANO It's been a while. It's Akiyoshi. I ran into Mizuki the other day. From Parade Free School. She said she's going to college. And her new band is called The Useless. I wanted to talk to you about something, Tabata. I'd love to hear from you. Bye. "Tabata," huh. NO MESSAGES I'm back. Was Kawahara okay? Yeah, what about you? She fell asleep like nothing happened. So about this Akiyoshi. She lied about creating it. I guess she had to say that because she stole it from us. I see. I guess so. I'll put that over here. Okay. Great, more spam. I didn't even go to this business info session. Maybe they're selling e-mail addresses of good students. I'm not sure about good students, but that's possible. Hey, Tosuke. When did you start getting more spam? What? Maybe about a month ago? Hey. Isn't that around the exchange? What? I've been getting more spam since Ten's barbecue. Does that mean-- LIST OF MOAI'S BUSINESS PARTNERS SPAM It's definitely it. Ten's selling our e-mail addresses to companies. They must be getting money or job offers in exchange. Seriously? There has to be a list with everyone's info. If we can get proof it's been sold, we can destroy Moai. How though? I'll directly ask the companies that sent the spam. Ask? If I use Ten's name and say the hard drive crashed, and we lost the list, someone could send it back. Could someone be that stupid? Someone was that stupid! Yeah. Hello? I got the list from the company. They sent the list back! Seriously? Are you at home? What? Yeah-- I'll come to you. Stupid. You're both… stupid. Hey. -That was quick. -Excuse me. Someone really was that stupid. They politely sent back the list. Look at this. What? Yeah. REGARDING THE LIST Look. BUNSHU UNIVERSITY MAEKAWA You're on it too. TABATA And me. Ten's been selling personal information. We can destroy Moai if we expose this on the Internet. I see. Huh? Hey, Kaede. What do you think about just dropping it here? What? Look, I know how you feel. Your friend died, and Moai was taken away from you. Wait. What's wrong, Tosuke? I bet Ten doesn't think he did anything wrong. He just wanted to help people get job offers. But that doesn't make it okay. Besides, he's definitely taking money or job offers for them. But just putting it on the Internet is just-- What? Did Ten convince you? What are you saying? They got in your head and you couldn't help yourself… to a lonely girl in a long-distance relationship. Didn't you say you weren't interested in her? Pon is good at pretending to sleep. She knew that we were trying to destroy Moai. She said we were stupid. What's so stupid? Ten's a good guy. What? I realized something. I thought that people saying stuff like "be the person you want to be" or "change the world" were cringey. But I realized that I was even worse, because all I did was laugh at them from the outside. What? I don't get it at all. What happened? What do you mean? You said Moai was stolen from you, but what did Akiyoshi do to you? You wouldn't understand anything about us. Hey, Kaede. Why don't you try talking to Akiyoshi? Then you might change how you see things. "Moai sells student information to businesses for money or job offers?" "What are the ideals of people who get close to others, reject them, and hurt them?" POST VIEW ACTIVITY "Seriously? What the hell?" -What is this? -I wonder how much my info's worth. -I see. -We're being sold. An embarrassment. "Moai's done, hooray!" "Truly an embarrassment." Holy crap! You guys are rotten. Is this a dating app? -I quit, but I guess it's too late. -Rest in peace. The world really changed. This is the person you wanted to be. Of course these pretentious students… That's why I hate them. "Bunshu University's club 'Moai' sold personal information of 4,000 students." AKIYOSHI HISANO "Here she is!" AKIYOSHI HISANO CALL HERE TO COMPLAIN "Akiyoshi Hisano is the leader, right? I've been to an exchange." "Akiyoshi makes an appearance!?" MOAI REPORT REGARDING THE INCIDENT "Club leader, Akiyoshi Hisano, will make a statement." MOAI DEBRIEFING SESSION REGARDING THE INCIDENT Tabata… Can we talk right now? Oh. I called the other day. Did you listen to my message? No. I see. Did you hear? Moai's in trouble right now. There were some problems. I'm about to report to everyone. Yeah. I'll cut to the chase. You're not here by coincidence, right? You're the one who uploaded the story, right? Me? Yes. Why would I do that? I don't know. But I get it now. What are you saying? Of course I'd recognize this. "What are the ideals…" I remembered as soon as I saw this. "…reject them, and hurt them?" What? Your life's theme, Tabata. Hypothetically, if it were me. So what? So what? Just try to put yourself in their shoes. Back when we were leaving everyone alone, nobody gave us any thought. But you started getting disgustingly bloated, acting all high and mighty. Everyone got annoyed with Moai. And now someone did this. That's all. This is a good opportunity. You can rebuild to become a proper Moai. What do you mean rebuild? What's a proper Moai? Is that why you did this? Yeah, that's right. It was me. I did it all. You're the one who lied. Lied? What happened to changing the world? And eliminating war? And becoming who you wanted to be? You talk about all these ideals. What has Moai done in three years? All you did was create a group full of brownnosers. You tricked everyone with your ideals. W-What are you saying? I'm saying Moai went crazy. You're the one who went crazy. -Do you know what you're saying? -I do. What made you like this? That's my line! You threw away your ideals. I didn't! I didn't throw away my ideals. I want to change the world. I want people to be happy. War, discrimination, and poverty should still be eliminated! Then stop wasting time with your career club! Wishing for those things isn't enough! In order to get what you want, you need means and methods! I still want those things! And what have you accomplished? How did the world change with your career assistance? You invited idiots and cut me out when you stopped needing me. Cut you out? What do you mean? You kicked me out! You left on your own. You didn't stop me! I asked you over and over! "Is this really okay?" You didn't say anything. How was I supposed to know? That's because you didn't even try to understand! You don't understand because you never tried thinking about me. Even when I wanted to talk, you always had people around you. You were just so busy with your love life. You weren't paying attention. Huh? Wait, hold on. Don't tell me you liked me? What? Is that why you did this? N-No, of course not. Gross. Is that what you meant by rebuild? You got jealous because I started dating someone else, so you did this? Don't insult me! I wouldn't-- That's such a stupid reason! You really are the worst. You disgust me! I never should've talked to you. You kept hanging around when you weren't wanted. I never should've talked to you. You, who didn't have any friends, who everyone made fun of, who nobody let join their clubs. I never should've opened up to you. If I didn't, my four years wouldn't have been this miserable. What happened to your ideals? Help everyone? You did it all for yourself! You just used me for your own convenience. It could've been anyone. But because I just happened to be there. It could've been anyone. That's-- That might be true. I wish I never met you. I bet I'm not alone. MOAI DEBRIEFING SESSION REGARDING THE INCIDENT Regarding this incident and our other activities for this year, the school and I will have a discussion. The direction for the third-years' events will be determined by this discussion. Regarding the future… …the school and I will have a discussion. Regarding the future… Well… I am truly sorry… about this incident. I've been thinking for a while what to say to you. Moai started out with just two members. Like a place where you meet a friend. Like an excuse to hang out. That was our team. I-- I-- I love Moai. It was a fun… and really important place for me. And I believed that as Moai grew, and people became who they wanted to be, I really thought that the world would become a better place. However, that was just for my own self-satisfaction. I started to think that I'm the one tainting the world. I know I've been naive. But… I'm sorry. I'm disbanding Moai. I'm very sorry. Tabata. Do you know where Akiyoshi is? What? Why? I want to apologize. I'm the one who made her disband Moai. I'm the one who posted it online. That was shitty. But I don't know where Akiyoshi is either. Yes, we used to date, but we broke up after a year. That's why I don't know where she is either. Found it. Why did you do it? Make her disband Moai? I thought she hurt me. That Akiyoshi was just using me for her convenience. And cut ties with me when she was done. That's why. But Tabata, people live their lives using others for their convenience. Like friends or lovers. Upperclassmen, underclassmen. They get close to lonely people when they're lonely. Also, when times are tough, they want someone by their side. We all live our lives using people just like that. And even if… it was for convenience, you were needed at that time. You should feel like that's enough. Although I'm not grown enough to actually feel that way. What-- What should I do? I-- I really don't know. I just-- wanted to be there forever. "I'm the one who forced Moai to disband." "I hurt someone important to me. I destroyed everything that person held dear. I think what I did was despicable. This is not the person I wanted to be." How did the world change? You're the one who lied. What happened to changing the world? And becoming who you wanted to be? You tricked everyone with your ideals. I never should've talked to you. I never should've opened up to you. I wish I never met you. I don't think violence is ever needed. I also… don't think violence is ever needed either. Sorry. BECOME THE PERSON YOU WANT TO BE! What's wrong? Look. "If I could've become who I wanted to be…" "I couldn't become the person I wanted to be." "I'm the one who forced Moai to disband." POST "Cringe LOL." "Stop trying to steal the limelight." "Who would fall for that?" "Ignoring this." Nothing changed. As there was no exchange of money, the university didn't punish the Moai members. …is very strong. Does anyone have any questions up to this point? No? Okay. I never saw Akiyoshi again. ONE YEAR LATER I can come with you. I'm okay. Master! Come here! Look. I made this. That's amazing. This stick figure runs into a wall. And he hits his head and falls over. That's amazing. It's awesome, right? KAWAHARA RISA "Long time no see." Tabata! FROM MOAI TO MOAI ARE YOU WHO YOU WANT TO BE? There were a lot who felt like me who couldn't let it end like that. So we all formed a club. Please take your time. TRASH COLLECTION EFFORT Mr. Octopus! What are you doing over there? -Hello. -Hello. I ruined it again. It's fine! Let me see it. Sorry. The world can be changed. See, like this. Just spin it around. Look! Isn't that really good? Just like this. If I became the person I wanted to be, would the world have changed? There's no way I could do it. I'm me. That hasn't changed. I don't want to get hurt. Of course, I'm scared. But… I have to try again. I might get ignored. Or rejected. But I don't care if I'm ignored. Or rejected. If that happens, I just need to… get hurt again. Subtitle translation by Zensho Yamamoto
