Hey! What the.. Music. Damn Nate, he did it again! [gunshots firing]. Music. If I didn't have bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck at all. Look, why don't you look where you're going?! Lord, you're the prettiest thing I ever saw. What's your name? It's Harry Tracy, the desperado. That's already killed 20 men. Well, that's not right, ma'am. As far as I could count, there's only, uh... 1...2... 8! Hey, Morrie! You ain't mad are you? Hold it! I'm the Sheriff here and this man is my prisoner. Just who the hell are you, anyway? I'm Morrie Nathan, United States Marshall for the Utah. You should've been expecting me. I'm gonna take this man back to the penitentiary. It's good I came by when I did or he wouldn't be anybody's prisoner, now would he? Hey! No pictures! No pictures! Get that thing out of here. Hold on now, Morrie. Let's just wait one minute. You shouldn't be taking all the credit for this. If I hadn't stolen a horse. Damn gun- see? He admits it now, you hear? Now, if I'd have my rifle- any man who's stealing on Christmas Eve, ain't got no decency, and should be strung up pretty damn quick. Heard you about hanging me and it's Christmas. Shut up, Harry, or else. I said, he's my prisoner. Boys don't start now. You let him break out. He got out of your penitentiary first. I could've had him in North Dakota. Show me a warrant, boy! What you say your name was? She's Catherine. I'm her sister, Judy. We're from Portland. That's in Oregon. Portland? Way out there. You know what I always want to do? I always wanted to get me on a boat and go for a ride on the ocean. Have you ever been in the ocean? Cate, man's a primitive. I've read he eats babies. IWell, that's only cause. they're so tender, ma'am. Don't fret on him. They were just Indian babies. TheYou know what I'm goinges. to do the time next time I break out? I'm going to come see you Kate, in Portland, Oregon. Up you, come on. Well, look at here Tracy. Look at here! Here's your ugly face right in front page. Bet you hear her being a young wench. It says Catherine Tuttle, daughter of recently deceased federal court judge Benjamin Tuttle, Portland, Oregon, was instrumental in the apprehension of famed outlaw, Harry Tracy. That's the newspaper people. Reporters, I don't know how they do it but every single time they get there. Let me see it, Morrie. This can't be a Tuttle now, she's much too famed for the likes of you. Morrie, let me see it. Judge's daughter. Ain't that pathetic. Are you the one? Are you responsible for this? Yeah. But, but ma'am, that picture, your picture will be on the front page of papers from New York to San Francisco. Most folks would tickle death to get their picture in the paper. Well, I am not one of them. Besides, I had no more to do with apprehending him than you did. It's all lies. You call him a mad dog killer. Yeah, when he could've harmed us. He did nothing. He could've taken us hostage or raped us. Why didn't you get a picture of that marshall trying to... I think he hit this man over the head instead of this. But, miss, I can't take pictures while people are moving. No,no,no,no,no. That's quite enough squabbling. My daughter is quite capable of making up her own mind and I'm afraid you'll just have to abide by her decision. You're ashamed, ma'am. I mean, everyone can see how Tracy was real taken with her. Now, your daughter could become a celebrity practically overnight. I mean to say we all know how outlaws get even more famous once they're dead. What do you mean dead? Tracy wasn't that severely injured. Besides, they've taken him to prison, not to the gallows. Well, if that marshall has his way. I reckon Tracy won't make it back to prison this time. Supposedly he caused trouble again and now they got him staked out behind the jail in his long underwear. Another hour, he'll be frozen to death. They can't do that. No, they can't. Good lord, what have they've done? He's still breathing, mother. Ladies, just who the hell are you? Who would it be that I know the law better than you do, Sheriff? This is a criminal act This isfor whichal act you could be jailed. Now, you get this man unshackled and inside before he perishes. The Marshall's doing, ma'am not mine. And being Federal Marshall, oh well, that means he's got more authority than I do. And well, it means he's got the keys too. I see. But where is this Marshall then? [door opens]. What the hell? We haven't time for pleasantries, Marshall. for pIf you don't comehall. and take your prisoner inside you'll have his murder on your hands. And I can assure you I will press charges myself. And who the devil are you to be telling me what to do? I am the widow of a federal court judge. And as such I still know who to go to in order to have your hide. We can start with the Governor, if you wish. [bells ringing] I am not sure how I'm gonna thank you for all you've done for me. I won't forget you. I I think perhaps it might be best if you didn't. What in the hell is the matter with you? Didn't you even think to take your hat off for a lady? I don't ever take my hat off. And sure enough not for some soft-hearted meddling woman. [water splashing]. Music. We better go check the cars. Pretty girl like you ought to be waiting on a new year at a party, don't you think? You sure don't say much, do you? I can never think of anything to say. Or you could say you'll remember me. You could say that, one time. I will remember you. Happy New Year, Catherine Tuttle. Happy New Year. Happy New Year, Harry Tracy. Make a wish. Music. I've got to use the facility. Nothing fancy, huh. Only one way I know how to do it, Morrie. [knocking on door] Hey Tracy! Don't go falling asleep in there. Put them down. Put them down! Now, who's in the box car? Two boys watching the horses. They don't even got guns. I have every reason to blow you to kingdom come, Morrie. But I never shot a man yet, who wasn't defending himself, and I ain't about to start right now. Now, you got off here I guess that means this is your stop. Now, turn around single file and start walking. All of you. It's a long way to Utah, Morrie. Single file that way. Come on, keep going. Right behind him. Start trotting. Trot! Don't look back. Music. Take this train up the track and don't stop until you got a least ten miles, alright? [gunshot firing]. Music. Happy new year, boys! Make a wish! Music. Who are you? Who am i? The question is who the hell are you? I'm Harry Tracy. Tracy? You are Tracy. I'm Dave Merril. I didn't ask you what your name was. I asked you who you were? I'm a painter. I come all this way to paint this country side and famous outlaws, just like you. You look like you could use a little warm food and a fire, Harry. Won't you come to the cabin. Nobody calls me Harry but my mama. She's in Indiana. Music. Where is everybody? Where's all the boys? I guess you aint heard. They're all gone. All of them. There's nobody here but me. I came here to paint them but there's nobody's here. Music. You're really a painter? Yeah. A good one too. Pays none too sweet. PayA couples timest. I'd have to do a little fast business to get some money. But I'll tell you something, Harry. I think the world should see a portrait of you done by me. That's what I think. Something else I'd be real honored. I could ride with you too. Well, a little portrait's just fine. Riding with me south, I don't want you dead. And I sure as hell don't need you. I'm sorry. I've come a long way I swear. And I got nowhere else to go. You know what year it is? 1900. Oh that means, is it taking a more wild bunch to joing up with? All that's left is ten horned politicians, government bootlickers, hired law. There's no more outlaws left, David. It's over. That's over. Even for portraits. None left. That actually means that's there's not gonna be anymore Americans left. And you know what else it means? You gotta be a painter. Cause David Merrill, you sure as hell can't cook. [gunshots] What are you doing? [gunshot firing]. Killing my horse. Do you suppose we could do another one for my ma? She's the only body I ever been partial to in my life. She's the tickle pink. You really wannna rob banks, Dave? Uh-hmmm. You know what they'd do to you if they catch you? No, what do they do? Hang yah. It appears not easy even getting that right. They tried doing the job on a poor, old, black jack ketchum, and they waited to speak down some bad, that they tore his head clean off his shoulders. I'd think it over, Dave. It could be a mighty plate. I can't wait anymore. Well, you are a hell of a painter. Yes, you're David Merrill. You are pretty damn good. Hah! One a hell of a painter. It appears as though you'll be riding out pretty soon, Harry. We should think about taking me along. I'd like to ride with you. I'm a good hand. Yeah. You damn never married your hand, this one. It's probably why you can hardly see. No, wait a minute. I can see as good as you, and you know it. Oh really? You razed a bank? Razed a bank? Sure. A couple. You better not eat this. That's pure bull, and you know it. The only thing you ever razed in your life was your pants. David... You are surely the mold on the market. Any man so desperate being an outlaw, there ain't hardly none left. There's a hand up. Besides, you ain't got much of a future as a painter. You said so yourself. You'll make a pathetic outlaw. But I'll be there. Okay? You just keep driving this until we a pond. Jumping off to the right. We got the horses there. Keep this thing going until I tell you to stop. Then you stop, alright? Music. Boys... You can tell him Harry Tracy is back. Music. Alright! This is it! Stop! Music. Go get at the ledge. Keep going! Come on! Music. [gunshots]. Come on. My glasses. I can't hit them? Come on, get in the woods. [gunshots]. I'll shoot them. You get in the woods! Get in the woods! [gunshots]. Help me off with my boots. I thought I was gonna die on that train. Some robber, you are. Here, the other one. What a gunman! Well, ain't that funny. I could've lost my glasses permanent. Where's the money? What money? Oh, didn't you see, huh? OWhile you were helping? the engineer drive that train, I had the chance,, to spend it. Take my boots, come on. This way so we won't be seen. We got to hurry up. Get around there. Behind the horses. Go. Just go over there. Come on, boy. Let's go. Come on, little boy. Get on that train with me, boy. Good boy. Come on we'll get some horses. Come oN. Come on, now. We got horses over there. Hey! Excuse me. But they split up. One went that way. The other one over there in the woods. Yah. Yah. Yah. Harry, that was some slick. That was some slick. Well, David, that's more than I can say for you. You know, I got a certain kind of reputation to uphold. I can't continue to tolerate this kind of rat hole incompetence. Word is gonna get around. Why is it my fault some fool pull the emergency switch. It wasn't my personal doing. Wait a minute. Forgive me. There is one good thing about banks. They ain't moving when you're robbing them. Come on. Music. Okay. Everybody. This here is a raid. Don't nobody move nothing, know how. You sure got impeccable grammar, you know that? For goodness sake. You can't rob my bank. This is the 20th century. I'm Harry Tracy. This is David Merrill. I presume that you're the manager. - Is that correct? - Yes. We're not actually robbing your bank. We're making what you might refer to as forced withdrawal. But we haven't been robbed since '87. Well! Don't you think it's time you were? Don't you want to make few headlines, huh? You know what this is, right here? Nitroglycerin! And there's enough in this little vial that I have here to blow us off, him and me and my fellow Dave here and all of you fine progressive folks from here to smithereens! Oh, no! Music. Come on, Harry. Let's go. Oops. Make a wish. My god! A robber came up! You know, Sheriff, we could look from hell of correction I can't find a sign on those two. Little wonder that Tracy knows all there is to know about running. But what if he should come back? You know I got to mind payrolls coming in at the end of the week. Burchill, you'll be out of the territory by tomorrow morning, either in Utah or Colorado just as far away as you can get. Skemp. Here, Skemp. Hey, Skemp. That's a good watch dog. Yeah. You've earned your reward, yeah. Come on. Let's go for a walk. Atta boy. Oh, god! It's them. The Sheriff said he wasn't gonna come back here again. I chose you wish it's not. I'm ready for you this time. You better not try anything. He's viscious. Sick him. Sick him, Skemp. Turn him into pieces. [dog barking] Well, he... He's...Usually vicious. Usually Good dog, Skemp. Yes! Must be his day-off from viciousness, huh? No siree. You're not going to fool me with that. Sir, I would never be fooling you, would i? Not again. Not on this day. [bomb explosion]. [coughs]. Holy Jesus! You portlets. [coughs]. Come on. Come on boy. Let's go home. Harry's gone. Come on now. Come on. Come on. Come on. Dave! Somebody's got backbone around here. [coughs]. Music. Harry, we're going to ride all the way to pacific ocean. Yeah. But first I got a little score to settle with a fellow. But it's actually on the way. Uhh, I'm sick of potion. Harry, who lives here? Morrie Nathan. He's a united states Marshall. Morrie Nathan. I've heard of him. He's supposed to be kind of a mean bull, isn't he? What are you going to do? Kill him. Worse. Ahh! Hi, Morrie. Well, I might've known it would be you. And who's that laughing hyena you got with you? You better shut your mouth, lawman, because if I put some holes in you, you're gonna sink quicker. Word I get is you've been busy lately. That the way of it? No, not really. Actually, Dave and I were just kinda passing by and figured that we'd pay you a visit. You know, use the old facility. Especially, as how I recollect a few months back, you tried to freeze me out, Morrie. We're standing here to your own waste and your own poo. And far to say as being froze out, but it'll have to do until next time. The next time, it will be when I catch you, Tracy cause I swear, I will. But I'll tell you something. I ain't never seen a dead lawman catch anything but flies. [gunshot]. Don't you ever do anything like that when you're with me again, you understand that? I never drew down on a man in my life unless he had a fair chance. Now put that in your holster. Put it away. I'll tell you something. How is it that whenever a body needs a photographer, they never seem to be around. Well sir, what do you think? Well, now Harry. Somehow, I thought it'll be a little bit bigger. You figure? What's the hell's the matter with you, boy? When we get to Portland, they got banks, and trains there too and I got a young lady with a smile. Music. I gotta get me one of those new pocket watches. What are we gonna to do now? Well, first off, we're gonna find out where she lives. Then, maybe we rob a bank and have some money. Okay? I maybe taking my life with my hand, but let me ask you something. You gotta stream on. If you don't know where she lives, what you gonna do, ask them? I'm a sweetheart. Alright? There's something special. That's what screws up people. I mean, that don't reflect good on earth, I'm wandering around town and people are thinking, Harry Tracy is asking where she lives. They got a phone company, let's peek on their books. Would you like a ride down, sir? No, no. Go ahead. If you have the phone number, If youthey'll give younumber, the address. If you have the address, If ythey'll give youess, the phone number. If you don't have either one, they ain't going to give you either one. Pathetic. Got a paper boy? Yup. What you want it for? Two cents. Atta, boy. Thank you, sir. Paper! Listen to this. Notorious desperado, Harry Tracy held up Youth County Bank in Bellfoot South Dakota on saturday making off over 8,000 in hard currency. What does it say about me? Couldn't say. Either one of us was there. What's the matter with you? Oh, I held that bank up. Scary. Three years ago. Alright. But isn't this how you get famous isn't this you get written up? No, it isn't! And I'm sick and tired of people doing this to me saying that I did things for I never was. I'm gonna to stop it. What if Catherine heard something like this? What is she supposed to think? Officer, you don't know a good lawyer in town, do you? Certainly, sir. Raymond millhouse. He's the best in state. Where is he at? He's just down the street. Big bay window is his office. Some people say he's gonna be our next Governor. Thank you. Now then, just what is it that you wish me to do about this, Mr. Tracy? I want you to write out a sworn statement that I'm sitting right here in your office, in this chair this morning, so as they'll all know that there's no way that I could've been the one that razed that bank back in Dakota. Then I want you to take this statment down to the newspaper and make sure that they print it. And you can say that I was holding a gun on you if you want. But you're not holding a gun on me, are you, Mr. Tracy? Well now, that could be arranged big'o. I'm taking a risk coming here to you. But then I'm not running for Governor, am i? Folks around here are saying that raymond millhouse is gonna be the next Governor. Policeman told me that down the street. You need publicity. You need money. How much? Well, there's a risk. Beyond the matter of compromising my principles. The cost would be considerable. Tell me, is your reputation worth that much to you, Mr. Tracy? My reputation to me is worth everything. And I might add a hell of a lot more than yours will ever be to you. Now you just tell me how much. Ten thousand. Are you asking me for $10,000? $10,000. I, I don't have $10,000. I got about six-sixty five hundred. Dave, loan me $3,500. Hell, no. Now, Harry, I'm not getting involved in a fool play like this. Now, I'd like to see my name in the papers. It don't matter to me whether I razed that bank or not. No! Ten thousand, Mr. Tracy or we have nothing more to talk about. Get your pen out. Start swearing out the statement. I'll go down and borrow the money. Music. Could you give me a little bit more? Atta, boy. Get it. Here you go, son. Look, walk on that side of the street. I'll meet you at the lawyer's office. thI'm running away.. Hide it. Hey, did you see that? Music. Follow the trolley and you're not gonna get hurt. Come on, take this thing around the corner. Around the corner! Alright, alright. Whatever you say. Catherine! Catherine! Catherine! Cath- Catherine! Catherine! Hold or I'll shoot! Catherine! Officer, i, I was just chasing after the trolley. Yeah, I waS... On my way to make a deposit. That's him. That's Harry Tracy. Tell it to the judge. Harry Tracy, you are hereby sentenced to 20 years confinement in the state penitentiary. David Felix Merill, you are duly sentenced to 13 years in the same institution. Did you hear, Mr. Tracy? Yes, sir. I heard you. I heard every word you said. I want you to know it was my fault that we got caught. It wasn't this man's. And I would also like you to know that it don't matter whether you lock me up for one day or 20 years. It will all feel exactly the same to me. [gavel pounding]. [chains clinking]. [hammer pounding]. I'm up! [hammer pounding]. [rumbling]. [thud]. Harry, these hands are not doing much painting anymore. Have you noticed? You haven't noticed. You know why? You son of-just because of you I'm in here! You are really pathetic, David. Hey, hey. Yours is coming! Music. My love for you is as wild and true as the wind over the sea on winter nights so bleak and cold it always will remain on summer eves when the breeze whispers your name like a star of this I'll be singing oh with you I will spend every evening and my love like the light above shall shine eternally at the end of time you'll still be mine and I'll be here with thee music. [horse galloping]. How are you? You finally got the smell off, did you, Morrie. You did it coming here, Harry. What are you doing around here? I was out here on business and I heard that nobody comes to visit you for a while and I just thought I'd pop in and pay a little social call. Looks like you've been doing quite a bit of popping on muffins. Couple of lbs there you stored down there. Well, that's because I haven't had you to chase around for the last 2 years, Harry. You're starting to look a little bit like an impregnated woman there, Morrie. What do you think? I'm told you've been acting a bit like woman yourself lately, haven't tried to break one. When I break, Morrie, I reckon you'll be the first to know. Yeah, I know. I'd come running too. And if I may, you're gonna let up until I kill you. Morrie, it's a pretty big word for you. Kill. You better be able to back up what you say. tYou know what I think,. Morrie? I think you better make a wish. [rumbling]. Wanna bust out? I found that the warden can be bought. I told him we had 12,000 hidden in the woods. Boy, he was caught. And that we would be more than glad to give it to him if he shoved us out. All the way out. See them pattern marks? SeeThere's gonna berks? two shotguns in. When the warden comes by, we can snip him up. We'll take him out. We'll strike him out. Cleaning up here. You'll have to bring me some more. Okay. Don't think about it too long. Everybody knows Harry Tracy can't be kept in a cage like a common animal. Me, I'm a painter, my talent, I'm not dying here in this sweatbox. Come on, we got to do it. I've been in here long enough. We'll go for it. You're going to have to bring me some more of this. Sure. Neither shotgun will have live shells in them. That way, once we get in the yard, you and me can drop down. My men will get a clear shot at Tracy. Alright. Just so as your men know which side I'm on. Sure. And I get a pardon. I get a full pardon. It's already been arranged with the new Governor. You got my word. That'll teach him to run. Visitor for Tracy. Let's just tell the Marshall I don't want to see him again. It's not the Marshall. He didn't come along. How's your family? My mother's fine. Judy got married last spring. Sh-she's very happy. How about you, are you happy? Oh, I don't have any plans to get married. That'll be quite a while. Why did you come here? I could ask you why you came to Portland. But I think the reason are the same. The judge at your trial is a known friend of the family. And I've been talking to him about reducing your sentence and I think if you'll promise not to attempt an escape... Catherine, please don't ask me to do that. I can't promise you that. As soon as I see we're clear I'm gone. You onced promised me that you will come and see me. I cross my heart. [rumbling]. Drop your gun better or they'll kill me . Come on, let's go. Come on. Harry, the shotgun. Use the shotgun. It's better. I got a rifle. I don't need a shotgun. Come on, the keys. Hey, get the keys. Open it up. [keys jingling]. Get down. Both of you. Step out of this joint, you're both dead. Don't fire! They'll kill me! Do whatever they say! Go ahead shoot. [gunshots]. Don't fire for god's sake! They'll kill me! Throw them down! Throw your rifles down! All of you! Come on! Music. Open it up. Come on, come on. [gate opens]. And we're headed to the door slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly. Open up. [gate opens]. [keys jingling]. Spikey, you knew you all the time! [gunshot ]. Music. with you, man? We don't do things like that. Music. [gunshots]. Music. [dogs barking]. Music. Mrs. Tuttle! Harry Tracy. I just had to come see her, ma'am. I understand. Have you eaten? Come inside. Really? I always thought that I liked it. I'll buy me a house and then paper swirls with bank notes. Then invite me a banker over for dinner. And I'd watch him choke when he comes through the door. God, that would be worse to him than paint the place with his own blood. Where did you get the money? First stop in the post office yesterday. You got to have work around money nowadays. It sure as hell ain't that good like the old days. [horse trotting]. [horse snorting]. They said you escaped with another man. Where is he now? Dave Merrill. Yeah, he's... A few miles from here, in a graveyard. He's dead? [laughs]. He's a pretty marginal fellow, David, but he ain't dead. You know graveyard's a good place to hide out because you'll never look there if you're going to take and find anything alive. [knocking]. The men are coming. Music. Get in the house. Music. You don't have the right to enter our home this way. Please leave at once. Well, if you're not hiding him, I'm sure you won't mind us looking around a bit. He's absolutely right, mother. We have nothing to hide, Marshall. You're welcome to look. Marshall! Marshall, up here quick! Music. There he goes. He's down on the ground! He's there by the river! Music. [horse galloping]. Music. [rifle cocking]. [horses galloping]. Come on, come on! Oh! [horse galloping]. [rifle cocking]. Cut the wire, son. And get on down here. What do you think? Well, I think you ought to button your fly. You go ahead and put these clothes on if you'd like to, son. But I wouldn't recommend it. But IWhy don't you taked it. your wagon and go on home. [rifle cocking]. And when you get there, you tell your folks that Tracy treated you decently. Cause you and I both know, boy, that I could put a bullet right between them crossed eyes, couldn't I? I'll tell them, Mr. Tracy. Giddy up! [horse snorting]. [horse trotting]. [coughs]. What the hell is she doing here? A present. She got a gun. We're not safe in these. They're sniffing around in these woods real hard. So we're going to have Sto move for a couplee of hours. Yeah, that's real smart. If you let me drill him when I had the chance, we wouldn't have this problem. We wouldn't see that warden chasing us, do you? Take the blanket. Let's go. [horse trotting]. Sit down a minute, Cate. I'm okay. It's alright. Just take a rest. Sit down right there. Thank you. Come on, Harry. We gotta keep moving. She's resting. Resting? What the hell? Thanks. Now, that's real touching. I always knew you were a gentleman, Harry. You know when we share everything- Shut up! We share everything. Shut up! She's with me. I'll be right over here. That's real good news. [coughing]. Your friend is really strange. Don't worry about him. He just shoots his mouth off when he gets scared. You are with me. Do you understand that? Dave? What? You want to talk about this? Talk about what? Remember our old friend, raymond millhouse, the lawyer in Portland we got messed up with? I do. He's the Governor now, Dave. I guess you already knew that, didn't you? I did not. Really? Did you read that? What's it say? Hmmm? It says you betrayed me, Dave. That's what it says. That you made a deal with the warden to get me killed and save your life. That's why both of you and the warden panicked when I went for the rifle instead of the scattered guns. That's also why you shot him before he had a chance to open his mouth. Ah, hell. It's your fault we got put in prison, Harry. It's your fault. You lost your nerve in that bank raid. I never lost my nerve. I was chasing after Catherine, you know it. She was on a trolley, I was trying to catch up to it. What the hells the matter with you? You never had any respect for me as a man, Harry or as his talent. Ever! You don't have any talent, Dave. People with talent got guts. You got guts? Then turn around and walk 10 paces that way. I'll walk 10 paces this way. We'll turn around and fire, fair enough? Well, you're such a gentleman. How about 7? Well, what about one Dave? Well, wWould that be Dave? a little better? Oh, it's loaded. Believe me. Not like the one back at the pent. Count them off. [rifles cocked]. You're not even fit to be an outlaw. Count them off. 1, 2, 3... Harry! [gunshot]. Are you alright? Catherine, are you alright? We've got to still move for a couple of hours before you get down. Can you do it? You've gotta do it, Catherine. Come on, pick it up. You'd think he could at least get us 4 or 5 steps before he tried something like that. Pathetic. Music. Could somebody lift that blanket off his face so I can get a true likeness of this historic occurrence? America will wanna know. [camera flashes]. [horse snorting]. [train whistles]. [train engine roaring]. Harry! Harry! Harry! Catherine, go home. [train engine roaring]. You're wrong. I'm not wrong. You stay with me, Yo they're gonna,, hunt you down like a dog. And kill you the same. Now, go home. If you stop now, they'll leave you alone. Please! Catherine. Catherine, the newspaper said that the Governor has sworn to bring me down. There's a 150 men on the chore everyday and more is coming all the time. Please, please go home. I, I know I know Harry [train whistles]. Oh god! Are you alright? I want to come with you, Harry. Oh, Catherine. Listen to me, please. I want to come with you. Just listen to me. I'm wanted in six states, dead or alive. This time it's gonna be dead, Catherine. They'll never put me in another cage and they'll never ever gonna hang me. [horse galloping]. When we were in a bunch, we took an oath that if anyone of us were ever trapped or wounded and couldn't see our way out we do it ourselves. Never let the law. Not any of them kept their vow. But I can tell you right now, Catherine, that I'm gonna keep mine. They'll never gonna take me. Never! They'll never gonna find you. We're gonna go. some place safe [gunshots]. Music. That's Tracy and his woman, alright. He killed two of my men. He's disappeared like a puff of smoke. [axe pounding]. [water splashing]. Slapping the old hog ey, son? You are Tracy! Hey daddy, it's Tracy. How are you doing? I'm Harry Tracy. This is Catherine. Good afternoon. Hello. We'll move on along. If you're worried about the danger, but, we sure could use a meal. Now, we insist on paying. Well, I don't think paying is the- I read about you in herald times. Pa said I must've read it a hundred times already. Well, look at this. Three banks and a train all in one day? Huh, son, I never did anything like that. Didn't your pa tell you that sometimes stories in there ain't always a hundred percent true? Look at here at the picture here. Now, look at me. Come on, ain't I better looking than him? Yeah. I'm Ely Porter. I want you to meet my wife Helen, my boy Matt, and my girl, Glendoline. You're welcome to sit with us, sir. Hey, Matt. We won't have any trouble paying for the food. What we have comes from the soil. Thank you. Won't you come in? You'll be wanting to wash up. I think we both like to wash. You children stay outside till I say. No, no, ma'am. That's okay. Let them come on in. We're gonna move right along as soon as we finish eating so as not to cause you any problem. Every couple of days a new crowd comes busting through here asking if we've seen you. Huffing and blowing about how dangerous you are to every man, woman and child. It's a lotta lie more than I've ever known. We won't. We owe it, will we pa? No, son. That's between you, the bank, and the railroad. They never did anything for folks like us. They never will, Ely. They will never do anything for folks like you. Catherine, these are pretty much worn but at least you'll have a change of clothes. - Oh, thank you very much. - Good luck to you, Harry. You've been very kind to us. Thank you. Boy, you know what that is? Yes, sir. What is it? A bullet. And where does it go? In your gun. Very good. You want it? Yes, sir. Go ahead but don't ever say that Harry Tracy never gave you nothing, okay? No, sir. Okay. You all make a wish now. Music. Where do we go from here? Oh, reaching left to right, they'll be expecting us to go either into Canada or to the ruse. It's Nathan and his Indian we got to worry about. The Governor will be trying to scrounge out every lay about and glory secret he could find. They're more suited to shoot each other in cowardice than they are at us. You're the expert. North or east? What do you think? I don't know. Let's not do either. Let's go northwest. Music. My goodness. Is that not the most beautiful thing you've ever seen in your life? Yeah. It always inspired me. In the waters, everything's a test. Tell me something, Captain. When you were a boy did you always dream working on boats like this? Come to think of it, suppose I did. How about you? I dreamed of being an outlaw. Yes, sir. I dreamed of being an outlaw. Music. Thank you again for a wonderful day! Welcome. We enjoyed having you. You take care of each other now. [horses galloping]. [laughing]. God damn it. Hold it. It tickles, hon. Oh god, I'm not gonna lug you around all day. My back is killing me. My Hold your horses.e. I got another one. Oh god, I hope you're gonna pay for this ride and maybe a fee. But it sure as hell ain't free. How are you? Fine. This your patch? We thought probably it was wild. We didn't see a house around or anything. So... Well, it was last year when I bought the place. Would you be Harry Tracy? All day. This is Catherine. My name is Eddie Hoyt. Pleased to meet you, Eddie. Shake my gun. Yes, sir, Eddie. It looks to me like you got the makings of a real fine place here. It appears to me like you've done a hell lot of work for a man all by himself. It's hot, hon. With that barn and all. I was hoping to finish that barn in the summer but I ran out of money. I'll have to wait for spring now. Well, we got plenty of money. We'd be glad to give you enough to make sure you could get it finished. Oh, I couldn't do that. Oh,You don't know meat. from a flat rock. You got no call to be helping me out in that fashion. No, I couldn't do that. We've got no worthy use for this, Eddie. We're actually getting a little tired of dragging it all over the countryside with this too. Here, it's yours. Come on. Carry on. Good. Good heavens. Are you sure? I'm sure. It's yours. Now, I'll tell you what we're gonna do, Catherine and I. We're gonna stay here and help you till you get that barn erected. How's that? All you got to do is keep us in food and real good coffee and promise no matter what, you will tell no one where we are. Fair enough? Oh yeah. I wouldn't do that. No, sir. You're a good man, Eddie. What do you think, Catherine? Is that alright with you? Yes. Get going, boy. I think we can trust him. I mean he... He's trusting us with his place. He leaves us off. I love you, Harry Tracy. Scoundrel and bad man and all-around impostor. Oh yeah, fooled me for quite a while, haven't you? I love you too, Catherine Tuttle, shameless consort of desperados. Music. Welcome back. That's a heck of a load of wood. You know what we can do first thing in the morning? We're gonna put some posts on that barn. How's that? Mighty fine. Music. [hammering]. Eddie, just look out there for a minute. Don't turn around but there's a bunch of men coming up behind us right now and they got me surrounded. Oh my god. I didn't do it. I know. What? I know you didn't do it. I know you didn't say anything. I'm gonna go down real slow. I want you to come after me, slow. Don't panic. When we get on the ground you're gonna grab Catherine and take her into the shed and keep her there and you must promise me you must keep her there until all the shooting is over. Will you do that? It's a promise. I'm gonna go first. Hammer. Keep hammering. [hammering]. [horses galloping]. Harry, what's wrong? Eddie. Harry? Music. [gunshots]. Hey, Morrie, [gunshots]. Glad you could make it. [gunshots]. That was an indication to say I'm over here. [gunshots]. You guys couldn't empty our house if you were sitting there in your right mind. [gunshots]. What's the matter? I'd say the americans are fantastic except for Morrie's Indians! [gunshots]. We got him, boys. See that? [yelling]. [gunshots]. I can't stop those morons shooting. But if you could talk him out of that field I can likely keep him alive. That isn't what he wants. Even you must understand what he's doing, Marshall. [gunshots]. [panting]. Catherine! Catherine. I'm here. [panting]. Make a wish. [gunshot]. Hold it. Hold it. That's good. [chattering]. Music. My love for you is as wild and true as the wind over the sea on winter nights so bleak and cold it always will remain on summer eves when the breeze whispers your name like a star of this I'll be singing oh with you I will spend every evening and my love like the light above shall shine eternally at the end of time you'll still be mine and I'll be here with thee my love for you is as wild and true as the wind over the tide as it travels 'round this whole wide world it gathers seeds of love through desert sands through snow and ice and high up above it gathers all the thoughts of lonely couples until the cup of love over bubbles and with a song it carries on through the skies of blue at the end of time you'll still be mine and I'll be here with you my love for you is as wild and true as the wind over the sea on winter nights so bleak and cold it always will remain on summer eves when the breeze whispers your name like a star of this I'll be singing oh if you ever spend every evening and my love like the light above shall shine eternally at the end of time you'll still be mine and I'll be here with thee
