[Man] Everything is ready. She's here. - [door opens] - [Young Woman] Hello. [Man] Welcome. Please, have a seat. I'm Robert Baez. This is Rachel Harris. We're going to be here for a while. Care for some coffee? [Young Woman] I'm okay. Thank you. [Robert] As you know, Ms. Harris is one of the top book writers in the country. She will be very specific about her questions. Please respond with the most accurate information you have. So you're claiming to know the story - about the Hagen family? - [Young Woman] Yes. Do you have any valuable sources to collaborate to your story? 'Cause I don't play games and if you're here just for the money, you can go somewhere else. [Young Woman] I'm not here for the money. I'm just here to share the story. Okay, then start. - From where? - From the very beginning. [Young Woman] It all started after Cindy's mother passed away. [Rachel] And how did the mother pass away? [Young Woman] One year before her death, she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Richard and his kids were devastated by that loss. He was depressed for a pretty long time. Two years passed and he figured that Cindy and Tommy needed him to get back up on his feet. So he found a new love and decided to move on. [country music plays] What are you thinking about? I'm so happy we finally got our own place. It's small, but we can do whatever we want now. Yeah, but I was thinking, wouldn't you get lonely? I mean, your kids are gone so fast and I think it's time to put that baby maker to use. [laughs] Really? You already have two kids of your own. I have two of my own. I want one with you. I know, I'm... I'm their step-mom. I'm fine with what we have. Step-mother... Soon to be their mother. But seriously, though, I hope she doesn't think I'm replacing her mom. She's not gonna think you're taking over for her mom. I'm sure she just misses her. We all do. I guess summer vacation's almost over. My mom's already asking when we're gonna go pick 'em up. Oh, we have to go school shopping for the kids and Tommy said he needs a new backpack. What? Honey, we're already over budget for the house as it is. We can afford a backpack. Turn this up. I don't want to miss this part. - It's my favorite part. - ♪ Even though I'm lucky and I'm ready ♪ For better or for worse ♪ I'm gonna carry ♪ We're gonna have our hurts ♪ But it's the treasure of my life ♪ Just to spend it by your side ♪ I know I'm ready ♪ Oh-oh-ohhh ♪ It's the treasure of my life ♪ Just to spend it by your side ♪ I know I'm ready [Rachel] Tell me about the house. [Young Woman] They bought this house without knowing the background of it. And I don't know. There's just something really strange about that house. [Richard] This place needs a paint job. Yeah, I know. What are you gonna do with that piano? I don't know. Maybe we'll keep it. I mean, Cindy will make good use of this. No, it's a waste of space. Just put it in the shed. But right now, first thing's first... clean up this mess.

This is our fifth night, honey. You picked the perfect house. I just can't believe they sold it to me for so cheap. [laughs] I can't wait for the kids to see it. I can't wait for the kids to tear it apart - more than it already is. - [giggles] It's gonna take us a little while to get used to it... but it's okay, right? Sure, honey, we'll be okay. [softly] Yeah. [wind rushing] What is that? It's probably crickets outside, getting it on. - [laughs] - You would, though. [Young Woman] Their first nights at the house were magical. Everything was perfect. [shrieks] [hissing] [whistling] [phone rings] [ringing] - Hello? - [Cindy] What's up, Paige? - Hey, hun. - What's going on? Nothing much. How are you? [quiet chatter] Oh, you didn't have to do that. Wait, you have a boyfriend? [Cindy] Yeah, please don't tell dad. Don't worry. I love secrets. I won't tell him. [Cindy] Okay, I tried to call dad, but he didn't pick up. - Is he there? - No, he's at work. - How's Tommy? - [Cindy] Stop! [Cindy] He's fine, making my life miserable as always. Don't say that. [Cindy] Stop! I'm telling you to stop. So how's the new place? - It's great. - Cool. It needs some renovations, but you guys are gonna like it. [Cindy] Sounds so awesome. Um, we are so ready to go. [sighs] All right, we'll be there Saturday, okay? So get your things together. - Okay, I will. Bye. - Bye. [sighs] All right, Paige. You wanted to be a mother. Let's do this. - [thumping] - [child laughing] [gasps] [clock ticking] [child giggles] [distorted laughter] [cackling] Hello? [high-pitched cackling] - [woman sobs] - Hello. [Old Woman] Shh. Silence. [Rachel] When did Cindy and Tommy appear in the story? [Young Woman] They were on vacation with their grandmother. They moved in a week or two after. - [keys turning] - [Cindy chuckling] - [Richard] Come here. - [Paige] Come on. So what do you think? It's nice here. I like it. - Can you show me my room? - Of course. Yeah. Here, I'll show you your room. It's so cute. You're gonna love it. - [suspenseful music] - I got you new sheets and I laid them out... Wow, this is cool. [piano playing] [soft melody continues] Hey! You play so well. I still need some practice, but I really love this piano. - Let me show you to your room. - Okay. So this is your room. It's small, but I think it's nice. It's nice. I like it. - Hey, Paige... - Yeah? Thank you for being so kind to me. Of course. So how was your grandma's house? Well, we did all sorts of things. We were on top of this tree and we jumped off. It was a lot of fun. Did you hurt yourself like last time? - Yeah. - Come on, you got this. Here! Whoo! [both chuckling] - Go long. - Hey, can I join you guys? Yeah, you know what? Come over here, take my place. I need a drink. [Tommy] Let's go, mom. [Paige laughing] [Richard] Think fast! Think fast! All right, I'll try. [Paige] All right, Tommy. - Here you go. - [Tommy chuckles] - Come on... - Ohh! Good catch. Good catch. Throw it back. All right, all right. Bring it in, bring it in. - [laughing] - [Cindy] You guys were playing without me? - That's so messed up. - Welcome home, guys. - [kids cheer] - Our new home. [all laugh and sigh] [Rachel] So far, they haven't experienced any weird activities in the house. When exactly did that start? [pen scribbling] [Young Woman] See... this is very different from any movie. If you move into a house infected by demons... [suspenseful music plays] don't expect... to get approached by them on your first nights in the house. First they make you feel comfortable... [voice echoes] then they attack. [echoing continues] [clock ticking] [ticking continues] [ticking stops] [ticking] [ticking] [thumping] [church bells ringing] - [banging] - Richard. Richard. [loud thumping] [wood creaks] - [creaking] - Richard! [creaking continues] [banging] [loud banging] Hello? [screams] [Tommy chuckles, echoing] What are you doing? What are you looking at, Cindy? Wait. [Tommy crying] Richard! [Cindy] Yeah, it is. Richard! [Richard] Tommy, don't... [indistinct yelling] [Tommy] Oh my God. Oh my God. [Cindy] No, no, no, don't do that. [Richard] No. Let him, let him, let him. - [Richard] There you go. - Cindy? - [Cindy] Oh my God. - [Richard] Come on, Tommy. - [Richard] One more piece. - [Cindy chatters] - [Richard chatters] - [Cindy] Oh my gosh. - [Richard laughs] - [Cindy] Whatever. [chatter continues] Richard! [gasping] - [sighs] - Are you okay? I was having a nightmare. The doorbell rang. I went to go answer it... and no one was there. I walked out and the door shut right behind me, leaving me out. What? And then... I saw Cindy, Tommy, and you talking. And then what? I was looking right at myself! [door thumping] [thumping continues] [Cindy] Tommy, can I ask you something? Sure. Have you heard anything weird in our new house? No. When you go to bed, do you hear any unusual noises? No. What about you? Have you heard anything weird in our new house? Yeah. What did you hear? I hear my own... My own room door opening on its own at night. [laughs] Let's go home, Cindy. You're just trying to freak me out. I'm serious. ♪ I'm through with love - ♪ I'll never love again... - [Paige] ♪ I'll never love again ♪ Said adieu to love... - [Paige] ♪ Said adieu to love... - ♪ Don't ever call again... - [Paige] ♪ I'll never fall again... - ♪ For I must have you... - [Paige] ♪ For I must have you... - ♪ Or no one ♪ And so I'm through with love [Paige] ♪ I'm through with love [Rachel] In the presence of Cindy, how did that make everything worse? [Young Woman] Cindy was seeking to speak with her mother. So she brought this weird-looking Ouija board from her grandma's house. She thought the Ouija board was the easiest way to communicate with the dead. Nick, guess what I just brought. I'm serious. I brought a Ouija board from my grandma's house. Didn't you say you played it before? She could find no food at all. She looked here and there, but there was no food. Then she began to eat the corn. Being very hungry, she ate a great deal and went on eating and eating. [sighs] The end. Good night, sweetie. [kisses] [Rachel] What about Cindy's relationship with Paige? [annoyed tone] What about it? Did she accept her as a substitute to her mother? I have no comment on that. [Cindy] Mom, this is a safe space. Can we talk? - [knocking] - [gasps] What are you doing in here? - Go to your room. - I can't sleep. Can I sleep with you? No, go sleep with Paige or something. I want to play. No. Don't touch this. If you don't let me play, I'm gonna tell dad what you're doing with your boyfriend in my grandma's bed. You little ba... You're not gonna tell him anything because you didn't see anything. Yes, I did, but it's okay. I don't want to play any more. [Cindy] Okay, come on. Put your fingers here and follow my lead. Okay. I'm having problems with the car again. - Really? - Yeah, I think it's over heating. We need a new car. Mom... Are you in this room? [planchette moves] Holy shit, it's working. [planchette continues moving] Wait, before we do that, I have to make sure it's mom. What is your name? Was she able to do it? [Young Woman] Yes. She intended to communicate with her mother, but someone else answered. - [planchette moves] - What? That's not mom. Who are you talking to and why are you moving it? Lower your voice. I'm not moving it. The spirit is. - What's a spirit? - [car engine sputters] Ah, come on, come on. [Tommy] Morgan... Why are you here? [planchette moving] You want me out. Out of where? [planchette moving] [planchette moving] [planchette moving] Thank you for opening what door? [gasps] You can't play a better trick, Cindy? What are you talking about? I'm going to bed. Your game sucks. - Wait, don't leave. - Bye, Cindy. [crickets chirp] Fuck. I need a new car. What the... Hello? - [metal clanking] - [animistic cackles] [groans] God damn it. [water rushing] [gasps] [breathing deeply] - All right, I'm out. - Where you going? I get to work 20 long hours. - [Cindy] What? - Come give your dad a hug. Bye, dad. - Good-bye. Be good... - Bye, dad. - To both of you. - I promise I will. - I love you. - Love you too. Can you give me some milk, please. [Paige humming] [continues humming] - [thumping] - [indistinct chatter] - [chatter] - Who's there? - [gasps] - [sinister laughter] [chatter echoes] Hello? Hello? Who's there? [metal clinking] [baby crying] [crying continues] [baby wailing] [wailing continues] [wailing continues] [baby crying] [crying continues] [screams] [clatter] [crackling] [distorted music] [static noise] [garbled screams] [static noise] [banging] [electricity crackles] [woman laughs] Ooh! [stilted tone] What happened to the lights? They went out. There's a weird smell in my room. I'll be there in a second, honey. Let me just find out why the lights went out. [gasps] [breathes deeply] [harsh breathing] [hyperventilating] [panting] [cries echo] [screaming] [gasps] - [growls] - [screams] What's wrong? What's wrong? - [harsh breathing] - What's going on? - [cries] - Are you okay? [crying] Paige, talk to me. - [sobbing] - What happened? [crying] The woman... [sobbing babbles] What? - [sobbing] - Honey, there is no one there. [hyperventilating] [sobbing] - [crying] - It's going... It's going to be okay. - [crying sobs] - It's okay. [wailing] Get up. What? What, Paige?! Oh my God. [whispers] There's someone right behind you. [sobbing] Paige, there's no one there. Honey, there's no one there. There's no one on the bed. [harsh breathing] We'll go in the living room, okay? Come on. - [sobbing] - Come on... let's go. [glass shatters] Holy shit! Ah! What the f... - Come on, Paige... - What's going on? - [Paige cries] - Oh my... - [Tommy] Mommy! - Let's go! Come on, you got to get up, go. Let's go. I don't want to be in that room any more. Honey, where are we supposed to go? My mom's is over two hours away. [whimpers] I don't care! I don't want to be in this house any more! How long have you been out here? [whispers] I don't know. All morning? You look tired. Why don't you get some rest, okay? - [whimpers] - I called Father Joseph. What did he say? He's on his way. Come on. Oh. Hi, I'm Lisa the next door neighbor. Oh, my name's Richard. - Hi. - This is my wife Paige. So what can we do for you? Oh, I was just... wanted to introduce myself. If you ever need anything, I'm five feet away. Thank you. - Hm-hmm. - Wait, wait, hold up. Yeah? What happened to the people who used to live here? Oh, they didn't last long. - Do you know why? - I don't know. They seemed really nice people though. But, I mean, you didn't hear any complaints or weird activity, did you? Who are you guys, the CIA? Jesus, I'm just the neighbor. I... I just thought... [sighs] Never mind. Look, if you think there's any criminal activities around here, there isn't, okay? This is a really quiet neighborhood. You picked up a good place. - Well, thank you. - Sure. Thank you. - I called in. - Called in where? I called in to work. Told 'em I won't be back till Monday. Richard, why did you do that? We need the money. I don't know when I'm gonna get unemployment. Honey, it's just for a couple days. We'll be fine. What the hell? [knocking] [lock clicking] Father. Father. There's something here that shouldn't be. Where are you sensing this? The bedroom. - I got it from here. - [Richard] Okay, Father. I'll be right... I'll be right there. [hissing] [Male voice] Shh. Silence. [creature exhales heavily] [manic laughter] [clanking] [metal creaking] [eerie whispering] Please, Father, give me the strength. Give me the strength. Give me... give me the strength, Jesus. Give me the strength. In the name of the Father... - [breathy exhale] - and the son, and the holy spirit... when Christ took flesh through the blessed virgin Mary, he made this his home with us. - [Father Joseph praying] - [demonic breathing] Walk me through the rest of the house, Richard. [clock ticking] Do you want some coffee, Father? Sure. Richard... So explain to me what activities were occurring here? It started about the second night we moved in. The second night? What exactly happened? Well, Richard told me... that I woke him up in the middle of the night saying that there was a woman crying outside. - Do you remember such a thing? - No, not at all. And then I was out fixing my car and then there was this woman in white. I must have blinked or looked away because she was across the street. I couldn't see her face, but she was looking right at me. I don't know, Father. I would get up and move right now, but we can't afford it. Look, Paige. Everything's gonna be okay. Just be strong. I got to get going. I'm going to leave you with something. Hang this somewhere around the house. It's blessed and it will keep any unwanted energy away from your home. Okay. I'm gonna get going. Okay. [crying] [crying] [sobbing] It was really good seeing you, Richard. God bless you. - Father. - Yes. There's something I didn't tell you. I found something... strange. Something strange? Father, you should probably wait here. [gulps] Richard... - This is really terrible. - What? - I got to go, Richard. - W... w... why? What do you suggest I do, Father? Father? [Rachel] Who do those ashes belong to? It was Morgan Le Fey. After I did my research, I found out she was born in 1913, murdered by her second husband and his children by means of satanic practices. Although she was pregnant, Morgan once was forced to confess that her unborn child had been fathered by the devil. The year of 1983, she was executed inside her home. People have claimed they've seen the spirit of Morgan several times, crying, looking for her child. She thinks it was stolen from her. Sure. Okay. Talk to you later. Bye. - [sighs] - What happened? - I have to go to work on Sunday. Why? The boss is going out of town, so I have to work my shift and his shift. - Oh, that's good. - Yeah. [screeching] - [screeching] - [gasps] [footsteps] [low growling] [piano plays] Cindy? Cindy. [clacking] [gasps] [hissing] Tommy. Cindy. [screaming] Ow! [screams] Tommy! Tommy! Paige! Paige! Open the door, Paige! Paige, open the door. Move, Tommy. Paige! I take it back, Cindy. [Tommy] Paige! Where are you? - [Tommy hyperventilates] - She's not in here, Tommy. - [Tommy gasps] - Oh, my God! [fumbling clatters] [clattering continues] [Cindy] Who's there? [Cindy] Who's there? [rapid breaths] Who is there? [screams] [Tommy] Cindy, what's going on? Cindy, where are you? - [hisses] - [gasps] [Tommy screams] [Cindy and Tommy screaming] [crying] [both babble, cry] - Oh my God, dad! - What's going on? It's the devil, dad, it's the devil! Jesus Christ! Where's Paige? I didn't see her in her room. [cries] There's something evil in the house. All right, all right. Just stay here, just stay here, okay? Wait here. Paige. Paige! What are you doing out here? Paige. Guys, get back. - Hello! - [knocking] Hello! - What's going on? - Hi, we're your neighbors. Remember us? We need some help. Is everything okay? No, there's something strange over at our house. - I can't explain it. - Okay, come on in. Okay, thank you. Come on, go, go, guys. Thank you so much. [Neighbor] Can I get you some water? - No, we're all right. - No, we're okay. Thank you. There's something or someone in our house and it won't let us sleep. It's driving us crazy. - Like an intruder? - No. It's... it's something not human. I don't understand. Something happens every night. I saw the old woman again. This evil old woman, she won't leave us alone. Oh god. You need to call the cops. Where'd you guys hear the noises coming from? We heard them from all over. What happened to the electricity? All the bulbs go on and off on their own. - [deep laughter] - [gasps] What was that? We hear that all the time before we go to sleep at night. [Tommy whimpers] Dad. - [clunking] - [gun clicks] Whoever's in there, come out! [dry laughter] Do you guys have a dead animal in here? [Richard] She's here. Paige, get the kids outside right now. - Come on, let's go. - [Cop] Who's she? [Tommy] Cindy, let's go. [Paige] Come on, kids, come on. [gunshot] [screams] - [screams] - Paige! - [banging] - Paige! Paige! [Cop] Agh! I can't open the door. Get back! Get back! Paige! We got to get her... Look, folks, I'm sorry, but I can't help you guys. But whatever you got going on inside your house, it overpasses the law. What I would do is I would contact the church. Thank you. How do you feel, honey? I'm good. Honey? We're gonna stay out here right now because I think it's in everybody's best interest to stay out here until someone from the church comes. I want to go back inside. [Cindy] I'm cold. Honey, no. And if you're tired, we'll go to a hotel. Okay, a hotel? We'll go to a hotel. No. I'm gonna go back inside. I'm gonna go back inside! [Tommy crying] - [crying] - Come here. Tell me about the cop. [Young Woman] He couldn't help them. He said that there were no crimes committed. So... so he refused to report it. Richard. Father. What's happening? I think the blessing you put on our house didn't work. It can't be. I'm afraid she witnessed it too? We all did. Where's Paige? She's inside. Show me to her. Of course. [door opens] Hi, Father. Let me... explain to you guys what I believe is happening here. There are things going on in this world... which are deliberately kept secret. This terrible problem... you guys are suffering from... is being caused by spirits. This kind of spirit... which delights in tormenting people... it's not a ghost... but a spirit of a special order. First of all... before I try to figure out this situation... we need to find out its reason. [breathes heavily] Do any of you know what may have caused - this problem in the house? - [Richard] No, Father, no. [Paige wheezes] - Paige. - [harsh breathes] - Stand up, Paige. - [Paige growls] [gruff voice] I'm fine! Stand up, I'm trying to help you. Stand up. I'm just trying to help you. - Look at me. - Honey, Paige. - [Tommy] Dad? - I need you to back up over here, please. - Paige... - [Tommy] Dad, what's going on? - [Richard] Cindy, get back here. - Can you hear me, Paige? Paige? Can you hear me, Paige? Can you hear me, Paige? Are you okay? Ah! Ahhh! [screams] [Joseph] Oh, God, no! - No! Ah! - [Paige continues screaming] What do you want with this family? Respond to me! Where is Paige? Respond to me right now! - [laughing] - I demand you... - [continues laughing] - to respond to me right now! Respond to me! Who are you and what do you want with this family? - Who are you? - [cries] Paige, can you hear me? [sniffs] Paige, is that you? Is that you? [Paige gasps] [whispers] Is that you? [whimpers] It's okay. Look over there. - [whimpering] - Your family... they're scared. - [cries] - Are you okay? [sobs] They're over there. Look. Look. Let's go with your family. You'll be okay. Let's go with your family. Come on, Paige. Go, Paige. Do you recognize them, Paige? Yes. Richard. I'm gonna try to communicate... with this... entity or spirit or whatever we have here. Yes, Father. In the name of Jesus Christ... I command you to reveal your identity! Show yourself to me. I want to know... why are you in this house. Do something. [banging] Who are you? Is that you? Give me another sign that you're here. In the name of Jesus Christ... reveal yourself to me! - Dad, I'm scared. - It's okay. [Joseph] I want to ask you a few questions. One knock for yes. Two knocks for no. Are you a man? Are you a boy? Are you a woman? [bang] [Richard] It's okay. Do you want this family to move out? One knock for yes. Two knocks for no. [bang] Oh my God, dad, I can't! It'll be okay, all right? Who is it that you don't like the most in this house? Is it Tommy? Is it Cindy? Is it their father? Is it their mother? [banging] [gasps] God. [crying] [Rachel] So by this time, Paige was Morgan's target? I think everyone in that house was the target. [scribbling] What about the demon? The one with the white face? He was the worst of all. He was so hateful. He's attached to Cindy. Stressed? What do you think? How is she doing? I gave her two extra sleeping pills, so she'd... She should be asleep by now. You know, Richard... I've worked on these kind of cases before and... and never have I... Have I witnessed anything like this before, Richard. This is definitely one for the books, right here. Father, I can't take it anymore. Have faith, Richard. - [crying] - Everything's going to be okay. I look at Paige. I see everything she's been through and I can't help but feel like it's my fault. Don't let this get to you, Richard. That's what the devil wants. He wants to break you emotionally. He wants you to be scared. He wants you to feel just like you're feeling right now, Richard. Your family's in danger, Richard. You're the only hope they got. Don't let the evil take over her. What do you mean take over? - [Cindy] Dad! - [Tommy] Dad! Yes? [Both] There's something wrong with Paige! [Tommy crying] [Richard] Oh my God. Richard, get the kids back! - [laughter] - Richard, get the kids back! Well, what do we do? What do we do? Let's go and get the neighbors. - Okay. - [Joseph] Tie her up. - Tie her up and concentrate. - Okay. I need you to hold her down. - Paige, are you there? - Father, stop, hold on. Paige? Paige, are you there? [staccato laugh] - In the name of... - [spits] and of the son, and of the holy spirit. - [screams] Father! [laughs] Get the container, Richard, right now. Father. [Paige wheezes] Scare principle of the universe, infinite are your powers... - [footsteps] - [wood creaking] [Joseph] absolute is your science. Grant me the power to reflect your divine will. Grant to me, divine father, the delegation of having power over malevolent spirits. Make me absolute, Lord, a vehicle of your infinite love to those who deserve it. [Paige wheezes] Hello. Do you know what this is right here? Do you know what this is right here? It's your ashes. These are your ashes, right? [laughing] These are your ashes. [wheezing inhale] [giggling] Those aren't my ashes. You liar! Who are you? What do we call you? [groaning] What do we call you? [Demonic voice] Morgan. These are your ashes. - [possessed laughter] - Now it's time for you to go. You have no reason here. [Morgan] If I go... I'm taking her with me. You fat, filthy bastard! [demonic laughter] You're dead. You don't belong here. [whimpers] Father, help me. - Paige, Paige. - Father, help me, please. Please. Please. Talk to me, Paige. Paige, talk to me. [Male demonic voice] Oh, Father. You better leave! [laughing] Where is Paige? What do you want with her? [Morgan] Her energy. Her energy? - Why do you want her energy? - [growls] Why do you want her energy? [groaning] Paige, if you're still here, say my name. If you're still here, say my name. [Morgan] Oh, Paigey's not here. [laughs] Morgan. - [grunts] - You understand that you don't belong here, - right, Morgan? - [spits] - I'm invincible. - How can I get rid of you? By praying. [laughing] Pray to who? Lucifer! - In the name of the father... - [Paige laughing] and the son, and of the holy spirit... [laughing] My father... [Morgan] Please give me the strength to defeat this monster. [laughing] Be strong, Richard. She's just playing games. Most glorious prince of the heavenly army... - St. Michael the archangel. - [laughing] In the name of the father, and of the son, and of the holy spirit... - [whimpering] - [praying in Spanish] - Richard. - I'm here. I'm right here. [screams] [Joseph] In the name of Jesus Christ... [screams] Paige! Paige! - [laughing] - Stop, Paige! - [screaming] - Paige, come on, Paige! Stop! Get off of me! In the name of Jesus Christ, our God and our Lord... - [praying] - I got her, I got her. - Thank you. - Hm. St. Michael, the archangel... - [indistinct prayer] - [Paige grunts] [Joseph] till the wicked perish at the presence of God. - [thunder claps] - [rain falls] - [angelic music] - Agh! [echoes] Dear God, behold this cross of the Lord! No! It's got to work. Getting tired, old man? [screams] In the name of the father, and in the name of our lord, - Jesus Christ... - [screams] will not divide the church of God. And from the soul, made from the unbearable lightness of God. [screams] Perish the blood divine of the lamb. [panting] [growling] [demonic scream] [Joseph] Help. Help! - Paige. - Father. [Richard] Wake up. Please. I'm right here. I'm right here, baby. - Please, Paige. - He's dead. Paige. Honey. Come on, come on. I told you I'd be right here, okay. Paige, I need you to wake up, okay? Paige, I need you to wake up. - He's dead, sorry. - Please, please, don't go. [crying] Please don't go, Paige. Oh my gosh. [Tommy crying] [Tommy] Mom! Wake up! [Cindy cries] I'm sorry, Paige. [Tommy] No, don't go. Mom, don't go. - [kids cry] - [Richard] Please, don't leave me. - [Tommy] Don't go! - [Cindy] Sorry. [crying] [cries echo] [crying] So after Paige's death, do you have any idea exactly what happened to Cindy and Tommy. [Young Woman] Cindy knew something wasn't right with Richard. They say that you can see the evil in his eyes. It was night time and they were driving down Route 66. Richard made a hard stop. He pointed the gun at Tommy's head... [Tommy echoes] Dad, no! - Dad, no, wait! - And shot him. Cindy ran of the car... and Richard shot himself in the head. - [gunshot] - And I'm pretty sure you know what happened after that. Impressive story. Thank you for sharing it. Sure. I got to go. Wait. What? This is a great story, but how do we know that you're telling us the truth? And how is it that you know so much about this family? I told you guys the story, just how you wanted it. Now it's up to you guys to decide if you'll believe me or not. [Rachel] One last question. This demon that was haunting Cindy, did she ever get rid of it?
