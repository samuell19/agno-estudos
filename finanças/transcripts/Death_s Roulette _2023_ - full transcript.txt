DEATH'S ROULETTE Calm down. Keep calm. I'll untie you. Are you okay? Where are we? What is this? Lupe? MARTA: Daughter? Lupe. Lupe? Lupe, my love. Mom? Daughter. Come here, my love. Mom? Mom. Are you okay? Yes. And you? Yes. We're together, okay? We're together. Honey. Help me, will you? LUPE: Yes. Yes. All right. Okay. We're together, okay? Where the hell am I? - Yes, we're together. - Back off. Who are you? What do you want? Calm down, calm down. Let me help you. I want to go home. Help her. You're not harmed. Are you okay? What happened to me? Calm down. Calm down. Calm down. Calm down, calm down. Let me help you. Okay? Where are we? I don't know. Calm down, mister. Calm down. Everything will be fine. Everything will be fine. How long have we been here? Damn it! Goddamn it. What? We're locked up. It's really cold in here, isn't it? Calm down. Deep breaths. Calm down. I wouldn't drink that if I were you. It could be poisoned. I don't think so. How do you know? If they wanted to kill us, they would have, right? Well, I wouldn't drink it. I would. Can I have some, please? Thank you. Anybody remember how we got here? Huh? The last thing I remember... is getting ready at the hotel to leave for Guadalajara Airport. It was about... half past 7. Next thing I remember is being tied up in the trunk of a car. I'm sure this is a kidnapping for ransom. Uh-huh. We have to wait until they tell us how much they want. I was at a medical conference in Puerto Vallarta. Two people came into my room, but I couldn't see their faces. I don't remember anything else. They knocked me out. Where did they kidnap you? In Mexico City. They also knocked us out... and we woke up here. They're going to kill us, aren't they? They're going to. Calm down, my love. Everything will be fine. They just want money. No. They're not looking for money. They just want to make us suffer. They tortured me for hours... and nobody asked me for anything. Let me take a look. Sorry. Sorry. His nails were yanked out. But this man is right. It's not just about money. What are we doing here? Maybe we all have something in common. What do you think? I don't know what the hell we have in common, but... we can start by introducing ourselves, right? I'm Lieutenant Simón Acosta Cruz. Mexico City Police Investigations. I'm Esteban Fernández Ávila, businessman. This is my wife and daughter. Lupe. Guadalupe. Besides being their daughter, I'm a human rights lawyer and environmentalist. Marta Carrillo Sepulveda. Like my husband said, he's a businessman. Very important. We're the owners of Grupo Suma. I'm a surgeon. Armando Grimoldi Páez. I'm Teresa Torres. I'm a stewardess. I'm José. Retired. "Welcome. You're here to play my game. There are just three simple rules." Rule Number One: You must choose someone from your group to die. Rule Number Two: The chosen one must agree to die. Rule Number Three: No one can volunteer to die. If you choose not to play, you will all be killed. You have one hour to decide who dies. That's not much time. They'll kill us. I told you, they'd kill us. - They'll kill us. - Calm down. Nobody's going to die here. We'll fix this. We'll fix this. Get me out of here! Get me out! Open up! Open up! Open up! Open up! I told you, they're going to kill us! Calm down, calm down. Calm down. We're here, we're here. Nobody's going to die here. No one's going to die. We're going to fix this. We'll fix it. - Get me out! - Open up! Open up! Please! For God's sake, calm down! Calm down! Now! Please, let's not play these psychos' game, okay? Let's not give them the satisfaction. Now calm down. This game thing is a ploy to extort more money. It's part of the negotiation, that's all. That's right. We have many influential friends and many contacts in the government as well. And I'm sure they're looking for us everywhere right now. So, what do you suggest? We just sit here and wait? Or what the hell? I'm not suggesting anything. All I'm saying is that maybe you'll get your ass saved thanks to us. Now, get this, I don't want to participate either. See what they did to this man? But we have no choice. Because if we don't choose, they'll kill us all. But if we choose, there's the possibility that some of us will survive. Or you'll survive. And if we choose, then what? What assurances do we have that the others will live? Well, then, I don't think women should participate. Is that so? Then men shouldn't either. How about that? Then let the cop be the one. Excuse me? Your duty is to protect the citizens, isn't it? Then protect us. It's one thing to protect you. It's another thing to sacrifice myself for you. Go to hell! Choose me. I'm the oldest. Well... he's right, isn't he? Well, look, that's true. No. No, what you're saying is awful. Well, yes. It sounds awful because it is awful. But it's also fair. We do that in the hospital. If there's one respirator and two patients need it, we go by age. I don't care! This isn't a hospital. How old are you? Seventy. Do you have a wife? Children? I live alone. My wife is pregnant. How do we know you're not lying? We can't choose José just because he's the oldest. His life matters as much as anyone else's. And what do you propose? Do you want to take his place? Take it. Lupe, please don't make it any harder, okay? Please. I propose a draw. No, no. No way. No. I don't agree with the draw. You can do it, but I won't participate. Nobody can force me. Me neither. José's age cannot be the only criterion to make this decision. Then how about a meritocracy? I'm a surgeon. I save the lives of five people a month. Sixty a year. So, definitely, my life matters more than any of yours. Very well. Our companies have over 80,000 employees. Those families are alive thanks to the work we provide. So you do the math. Marta, - your husband's a coward. - What? And, you, Esteban, are a jerkoff. Jerkoff? If you had any balls, you'd have volunteered to save your wife and your little girl. I won't play your game. - You're a filthy doctor. - No way. You're a coward! JOSÉ: Enough. Stop arguing. Vote. Choose me. No. I'm not picking him. He wants to do it. Okay? He wants to do it. Mister, you are very brave. And very generous. Thank you very much. Mr. José? Thank you very much. You are an angel. Mister, please don't be swayed. For God's sake, Lupe. Don't bother, miss. I have nothing left to do. My life has been very difficult. Yes, but it doesn't have to end this way, sir. Believe me... it's for the best. Why do you say that? I've done things in my life... that I'm not proud of. What did you do? I don't want to talk about it. You've lived with guilt all these years, haven't you? Participant violated Rule Number Three. I'll repeat the three simple rules you must follow. Rule Number One: You must choose someone from your group to die. Rule Number Two: The chosen one must agree to die. Rule Number Three: No one can volunteer to die. Pieces of shit. I advise you to agree quickly, or everyone will die. The game must continue. Esteban, do something, please. Please. How much do you want? Five million? Ten million? I just need a phone! I can transfer whatever you ask! Shut up, Esteban! Don't you realize that your goddamn money is no good here? You shut up, asshole. I told you that we had to keep going with this goddamn game. And now we have one option less. Calm down. Your father is here. Please. READ "The clock is ticking against you. Before continuing, you must solve the next acrostic." Those are references. And if we don't play? The white-haired guy shows up with his girlfriend and his shotgun, and he kills us all, huh? Come on. Let's start. You read. I'll help with the letters. Come on. Surname of Fernández Ávila's figurehead." I don't have figureheads. And I'm Norwegian with blue eyes, right? Say it! Pereira. He's... Ahem. He's more of a partner. Teresa's addicted to...?" What? What are you addicted to? Eleven letters. Amphetamines. Correct? Tremors... sweating, exhaustion, dry mouth. You're suffering from withdrawal. Or am I wrong? Lupe falsified her diploma from...?" High school. Well, well, well. The girl didn't even finish high school. How the hell do they know these things? My God. This is a nightmare. My gym teacher hated me. I would never have passed. Psst! I really don't care. Continue. Partner betrayed by Simón." Lorenzo. And I didn't betray him. I reported his corruption. Marta's sister's name?" No, that's wrong. Mom doesn't have a sister. She's an only child. What was her name? Tell us, damn it! I'm telling you, she's an only child. Ofelia. What? Ofelia? Do...? Do I have an aunt named Ofelia? Why didn't I know? Why...? I never wanted to tell you. She died very young. Poor thing. When? Long before you were born. Why did you keep it from me? If you don't mind, I'll continue. José is...?" An old man? Dead. No, eight letters. Retired. He said he was retired, right? Try "retired." It has eight letters. Okay. "Seven. Teresa's dealer's nickname." "Elf." Sexually transmitted disease suffered by Arman..." Assholes. How do these goddamn psychopaths know everything about us? Okay, say it. Say it now! Gonorrhea. Put gonorrhea. Esteban's second lover was...?" Alejandra. Which Alejandra? Your father's secretary. I don't remember her. It didn't last long. Forgive me. I'm not proud of that. For God's sake, stop this game. Now! Please! "Pablo Jega"? Do you know anyone named Pablo Jega? No. J-jega? No. No. It's Pablo Vega. Who is he? A killer who thinks he's a hero. A sadist. And... where did you meet him? I chased him many times. But he was like a ghost. He always slipped away. He killed a lot of people. Judges, politicians, prosecutors... all of them corrupt. He made them play a morbid game. What he did with... With Judge Echegaray was... horrible. He tortured him... opened his stomach with a knife, took out his guts. And he forced his whole family to play Hangman with... They had to write on the walls with the blood they took from the judge's stomach. Did they ever catch him? Never. I never saw his face. All the witnesses gave us... different descriptions. Until, one day, I got an anonymous call, and we cornered him in a motel outside Cuernavaca. It was nighttime. We knocked down the door, and I saw a silhouette. I was... I was afraid. I was full of adrenaline. And... I thought it was Pablo. And when he... put his hand on his waist, I thought he was going to pull a gun and shoot me, so... I fired first. And... it wasn't him. It was his wife. And... Pablo? Sometime later, we heard that he ran away a few minutes before we arrived. Since then, I haven't been able to cope with the guilt. I'm sure Pablo locked us in here. Are you okay? Are you okay, Mom? Pablo! I couldn't do anything. She arrived wrecked to the hospital, Pablo. I swear, I did everything I could to save her! Let's talk, please. Please, Pablo, let's talk. Pablo! Pablo! Let's talk, Pablo! What are you talking about? Patricia Vega... Pablo's mother died in my operating room. What do you mean, she died? She was hit by a car... and the driver abandoned her. I couldn't do anything. No, that's a lie. What you're saying is a lie. What the hell is wrong with you? - I - hit her with my car. But she was alive. She just had fractures. She was alive. I didn't kill her. When they brought her in, she was unconscious. She was conscious! She was alive! I know what I did was wrong. I shouldn't have left. But I did regret it! I regretted it and I came back. I came back and looked for her, and she wasn't there. So I went to the hospitals that were close to where the accident was, and I found her! And then they told me her name and that she only had fractures in her leg and that she would be okay. I didn't kill her. I vote for Teresa. No, no, no. What the hell are you doing? No. I say what I think is fair. Is that so? First, you're a good doctor and take care of me, and now you want to kill me? You're a shit, asshole! Asshole! Are you okay? Yes. You touch her again and I'll kick your ass. Let's finish this goddamn game. An addict who swallows a bottle of amphetamines, drives a car and runs over a woman on the street deserves to die much more than any of us. If you're so innocent, then why the hell are you here? Because I couldn't save her. Testimony of Nurse Paloma López. The patient hada triple fracture in both legs. A repair surgery was needed. She had an arrhythmia, and the doctor put in the endotracheal tube. It's a routine procedure, a normal procedure. But Grimoldi misplaced it. The technician and I warned him that he was doing it wrong, but he didn't listen. Shut up. Shut up, you goddamn liar! Shut up! He punctured her esophagus... and the woman died. Forgive me, Pablo. It was a mistake. It was my only mistake in life. I told you. You killed her. And Pablo knows it. I devoted my entire life to saving lives. Like him. What, he's your best friend? What a piece of work. Simón risks his life every day to save the lives of people he doesn't even know, like me. You make a bad decision, and your patient dies in the operating room. Or, one day, in a police operation, you kill the wrong person, don't you, Simón? There are risks you take when you do things for other people, but what the hell, huh? "Pasta or chicken?" Go to hell! I vote for the doctor. Eh? He killed her! He said so. He killed her. Who's with me? We have to vote. See? She doesn't care about anyone's life. This is how these addicts are. If she was able to board a plane high on amphetamines, she'd drive her car high too. You really don't get it? That's what the psycho wants, for us to attack each other. Stop it. Let's see. Let's face it. We're six people. None of us will vote against each other because we're family. So everything is between you. Mm-hm. So the doctor, Teresa or Simón. I don't know. I'm not sure about that. Maybe your wife will vote for you. You're crazy. I would never vote for him. My husband is the love of my life. Well, he cheated on you. Honey, it'll take a lot more than that to destroy us. And you? None of us has caused Pablo more suffering than you. No. No, no, no. There are no innocents here. We're all guilty here. We've all hurt him in some way. The three of us know why we're here, but what about you? Eh? What the hell did you do to Pablo? Because before I vote, I'd like to know. I'd like to know too. And me. We just... Patricia Vega. Pablo's mother. Worked as a servant in our house for a while. Then she got pregnant and left. She resigned. You didn't get her pregnant? What did you say? What? That seems logical to me. They're hiding something from us. Sure. Hm. The pregnancy thing... makes sense to me. Maybe... Pablo is his son. What a bullshit strategy. Is it true?

Aunt Ofelia had many problems. It's a very sad story. We'd love to hear it. Yes. Stay out of this, asshole. Details. They said to look at the details. Look at this picture. "I was born here." "An asylum." An asylum. My aunt gave birth in an asylum? Now is not the time, my love. Esteban! That's it. That's it. It doesn't matter now. Ofelia was my older sister. She was always a very troubled girl, depressed. She tried to kill herself several times. Until my father decided to commit her. At first, the therapy worked. The doctors said she was getting better. Until someone raped her. We tried to change her mind, but she refused to have an abortion. The child had a mark on his arm and was born very weak, poor thing. Keep him. I couldn't take care of him. We decided to leave him with the midwife. She seemed to be a good woman. And she had grown very fond of the child. Besides, she knew very well the care he needed. You gave your nephew away. No, I didn't give him away. I gave him up for adoption, which is very different. I couldn't take care of that child. It was your own blood. Your mother and I did the best we could at the time. You abandoned your sister in an asylum and gave her baby away. And you said I was a bad person? Do you realize... that it's your fault that the kid turned into a killer and that we're locked up here? You have no idea what it's like to live with an unbalanced person like her. My sister ruined my youth with her madness. We're running out of time. So, what the hell are we going to do, huh? Well, are you two going to agree to die? What kind of question is that? Whatever you say, no matter what sin you've committed in the past or the shit that comes out... Simón, is there anything that could happen that would make you decide to die today? Be honest, asshole. Of course not. Teresa. Uh-uh. Me neither. None of us is willing to die. So we're all going to die. What do you mean? I don't care if I die alone or with you. But not you bastards. You're going to see your daughter die. Even if you die a second earlier, you're going to die in pain, knowing that your daughter's life also ends today. You son of a bitch. You are a real bastard. It's obvious that Pablo put Lupe here to get back at you. Or perhaps to test you, to see if you're capable of giving up your lives for Lupe. It's not personal. I want to survive too, just like everyone else here. Teresa. You also have a son, right? How much does his father earn a year? A hundred and twenty thousand pesos? Hm? What do you care? I imagine he goes to a public school in Estado de Mexico. It's so hard, isn't it? I mean, even if you're a smart kid, hard-working, when you start at the bottom... Don't mess with my son. We can give him a future. A million dollars, if you agree to die. What? No, no, no. You can't do that. Why not? The rules of the game don't forbid bribing someone else. That's right. Teresa, don't listen to them. That money will never reach your son. Don't trust them. You would force us to keep our word, wouldn't you? Think about it. A career in the most important university in Mexico. He'll never want for anything. Or you go home, safe and sound. Your son will be very happy to see his mother again. But then what? Tell me. What future awaits him? Eh? To be a waiter? To end up, hopefully, as a clerk? After getting his girlfriend pregnant? His dreams of becoming a naval engineer will go down the drain. Decide. Time is running out. Do you know how many door knobs I touch in a day? None. There's always someone opening the door for me. The driver, an employee, my secretary. That's how the world works, Teresa. There are the door-openers and important people, like us, who just walk through them. What destiny do you want for your child? You choose. Well, you're right. My son would have such a different life with that money. But then he would become a shitty person like you two. So I'd rather him take the hard way than help you. Either you die, or you'll see your goddamn daughter die. Shit! I vote for Esteban. What? No. Me too. Me too. If you vote for me, I'll agree to die. No! No! No, no, no. We talked about it. We talked about it and you promised me. You promised me! Yes! Yes! No, no, no. Listen to me. I won't allow it. Do you hear me? I won't allow it. I'm the only culprit, okay? I'm the only one responsible. I was the one who wanted to leave my sister in the asylum. My husband has nothing to do with it. - Enough, Mom. Stop, stop. - Please. Enough. I couldn't live without you. Honey, you are the most beautiful thing in my life, but I have to make things right, okay? No, no, no. No, Mom. Please, don't do this. No, no. If it's better this way... I don't care. I change my vote. I vote for Marta. No. Mom... Marta. Mom, no, please don't do it. I also vote for Marta. Mom... No, no, Mom... Please, I beg you! Pablo. Pablo, they chose me. They chose me, they voted, and I accept dying. No, no, no. No, Mom, no. Let go of me! Pablo, I'm sorry. I failed you and my sister. Let this game be over. And when you kill me, release my daughter. Release her and let her go with her father. I beg you. Truly, I beg you. Mom, the clock stopped. The clock stopped. Are you okay? Yes. Sit down and enjoy. You should take it, Teresa. The withdrawal will kill you. No. No. This shit has ruined my life. Pass me the wine, Simón. Mmm. This wine is exquisite. Would you like some, Esteban? Go to hell, you goddamn braggart. It's your loss. Right now, we shouldn't be on a diet. I'm telling you as a doctor. Let's eat. Let's eat. Mm. I don't know how you can be in the mood to eat. Armando's right. If they're going to kill us... I'd rather die on a full stomach. You're right. If they didn't shoot, it's because they forgave you, right? Maybe they forgave us all. After hearing our confessions. Sure. Of course. Pablo kidnapped us, brought us to his mansion... killed a man in front of us and in front of a cop. And now that he has forgiven us, he offers us this delicious banquet of reconciliation, and now we're going home. Too bad José didn't make it. Poor man. Why would they torture him like that? Retired. We said retired, right? Eight letters. But, really, it had to start with a "V" to complete the "Vega" surname. He was the rapist. Of course. He was probably the one who raped Ofelia in the asylum. That's why they tortured him by removing his nails. Oh, my God. Son of a bitch. If I had known, I would have killed him. That's ironic, Lupita. You defended him. He's your aunt's rapist. - Son of a bitch. - What happened? - I cut myself. - Are you okay? Yeah. "Do it yourself." Give me that knife. No way, asshole. No way! What are you doing? Move! I told you. Put that knife down! I told you that this wasn't over! - Drop it, bastard. - We already agreed who's going to die and your wife accepted. So we have to do it. Put that knife down, bastard. Who wants to do it? You? Or you, Teresa? With an incision to the carotid, I swear, you will not suffer. Forgive me, but I have to go back to my family. Let him go! Put that down! Let him go! Let him go! You messed me up, asshole. Son of a bitch. How can I help you? What can I do? Tell me what to do. No. No. Nothing can be done. This bastard... This bastard killed me. How can I help you? No, nothing can be done. Armando. Armando. Get us out of here. Please. You can get us all out of here. Time is running out. Please. You can get us out. Please! I want to see my son. Please. I vote for Armando. I vote for Armando. Please. You can all go to hell. But yes. I agree to die. Now you have to kill me because there's no time. Esteban. Come closer. Grab the knife. Go through my esophagus up to my heart. But look into my eyes. Wait. Wait a minute. Wait, wait. Do it. Quick. Go through my esophagus to my heart, push, push! Done? Done? It's over. He's dead. Stop! Stop, please! I'm sorry, Armando. I'm so sorry. We shouldn't leave him here. We can't stay here. We have to try to survive. Come on, come on. Come on. Come on. Careful. Let's go. What is this? What is this? We're in a goddamn maze. We'd better split up. Come on. No. No, no, no. Something's not right. No. Okay. Let's go back. What if this is a trap? What if this is a trap? Please, let's go back. Hey. The others aren't coming. Doesn't matter. Let's go. Shit! Asshole! A gunshot? That was a gunshot! Teresa! Hey! No! I don't want to die. No! Teresa! Left, left! Teresa! Teresa! Damn it! No. Run! It's you... Pablo? Pablo Vega. Welcome. You are here to play my game. I cut myself. I never saw his face. All the witnesses gave us different descriptions. This is where I was born. An asylum. "Holidays with Mom." Pablo is a psychopath. A killer. Let me go with my son. Please. Let me. Don't do the same to him! Please. Pablo! Pablo! ♪ Well... Ow! ♪ ♪ Rock the cradle of love ♪ ♪ Rock the cradle of love ♪ ♪ Yes, the cradle of love ♪ Let's go! Let's go! Come on. Come on. Wait! Hey! Wait, wait! Stop. Stop, stop, stop. Esteban! Stop! Esteban! Esteban, stop! Stop! No! You're going to let them kill him? I'm sorry. No! No! Stop! What are you doing? I'm not leaving him! You okay? Thank you. Thank you. Let's go. Come on. Help me with the anchor. Come on. Go! No. No. It's you. Yes, it's me. Dear uncle and aunt! I would have loved to have a different introduction, but, you see, the truth is like that. Even if we try to cover it up, it always comes out. Come on, you bastard. Walk. Come. Watch out. Move over there. You, there. Come on, go. Very good. I guess you have lots of questions. But time is up, and I want to play one last game. It's a classic. And classics never die. Ironically, several died today, no? We're going to play Russian roulette. In this gun, there's one bullet. Each one of you will shoot the other. If you try to shoot me, - I'll kill your daughter. - No. If you try to kill yourselves or do any other stupid thing, I'll also kill her. So who goes first? Any volunteers? No one? Well, then... ladies first. Come on. Aim and shoot. Aim and shoot. Come on, go! No, no, no. Not there. Raise it up, to the head. Like this. Here. Come on! To the head, damn it. That's it. Very good. Come on. That's it. Shoot. Shoot. Shoot, damn it! Come on! I can't! I can't! I can't! I'll give you a little inspiration. Alejandra, for example. By the way, Alejandra wasn't a secretary. She went to school with you. Don't listen to him. - He would say anything. - Yeah? And all the others who say you abused them, are they conspiring too, you bastard? Are they lying? Like Carolina, another classmate of Lupe's, and many others, asshole! Huh? Guess who was next on the list. Yes? I'll take any names, guesses. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's see. Lupe. No! No! No, that's not true. Lupe, am I lying? Yes or no? Lupe, am I lying? Yes or no? No. No. See? Come on. Shoot! Goddamn it, shoot! This asshole is your goddamn obsession, right? Your turn, asshole. Come on, take the gun. Aim at her. Aim at her head. Go. Come on! Go! Forgive me, love. Very good! Very good! You never disappoint. This asshole was capable of shooting you. And not a single hair on his head was messed up. And you couldn't. Do you know why he could? Because he's a psychopath. Because he has no feelings. Because he just cheats. Tell them to go home. It's all under control. Darling, what are you doing? I had an anguish that had no name... that had no face. I couldn't find the cause of this discomfort, of this emptiness in my chest that couldn't be filled with anything. Sometimes drugs would work... but the void always came back. I felt so... disengaged, so... uncomfortable in my own skin. Until I met Pablo... and he opened my eyes. He... He... He didn't rape them. They were consensual relationships. Consensual? Yes. That's the bullshit this bastard told you? They were just girls, Mom! At that age, there can be no consent! When Pablo told me everything... I remembered. I remembered how you looked at me... how you watched me undress. I remembered how you touched me. Like a dad should never touch his daughter! You abused me, bastard. I never... You never what? Never what? Are you really going to lie right now? Aren't you going to have the balls to tell my mother the truth? What you did to me when I was a kid. But it doesn't matter, right? Because you knew. You always knew and you never did anything. Come on, let's finish this. Come on, come on. Come on! Move. Back up. Back up now, you bastard! Come on, let's finish this. Shoot.
