Take her off! Giddap! Somebody help me! Help me! Tom! DIRECTOR: Cut! -I said cut. -That was great. Okay, that's lunch. Half an hour. -Hi, Tom. -Alfie. -Hello, Tom. -Miss Victoria. -You look mighty pretty today. -Thanks. So do you. Let's go for a walk, Tom. Randy, bring a couple chairs. The film's looking very good. Afraid we may have another big hit on our hands. -You came here to tell me that? -No. -I didn't think so. I just bought a sensational script called Lawman. About a famous frontier marshal, Wyatt Earp. Yeah, I heard of him. "Alperin Films presents Tom Mix, Hollywood's most famous cowboy "starring as Wyatt Earp, the West's famous lawman." Whoa. -I'll get Earp as technical advisor. -Now hold on! I didn't become numero uno at the box office by playing other people. Tom, this is a very important project to me. Fox and Chaplin are gambling on sound. I'm betting my bankroll on you in Lawman. What if I don't agree? Fact is, I'll be very unhappy. And you'll have to sit out your contract. When's it up That's four years. What are we saying? You haven't read the script yet. I may be wrong, but I'm sure you'll love it. Well, I'll read it. I'll let you know in the morning. Fine. I wanna start shooting next month. I still have to talk to the famous marshal. DIRECTOR: All right, let's get back to work. It should be educational, working with a real gunfighter. Maybe he'll give you some pointers. Yeah, I bet he will. You've got the wrong end of the horse. Depends on how you look at it. If you was Tony Jr., here, you'd think you got the wrong end of Tom Mix. -Bye, Alfie. -Bye. -No, but he will. Where's he going? -It's been a pleasure, Mr. Earp. -Feeling's mutual, George. -That's right. Tom Mix, isn't it? That's right. Can I give you a lift into town? On your horse? No, Tony Jr. ain't got no license plates. I'm afraid you'll have to ride in the Duesenberg. There's a press conference at 2:00. At 3:30, you meet with Mr. Alperin. At 4:00, we have a photo session. Will he have enough time to get to the radio station by 5:30? If we finish the photos by 4:45. Do you have clothes that look Western? We'll get something in wardrobe. You look like a Texas oil man instead of a sheriff. -A marshal. -Marshal. What's the difference? Hey, here they come! Would you ever consider acting? Excuse me. I'm not gonna like staying here. Then let's find you a place where you will like staying. Will Alperin be disappointed if I don't show up for those things? Yeah. That worry you? I hired on as an advisor, not a celebrity. Well, that's it. I lived here before I got famous. Quiet. Private. -Washed my socks in the sink. Sure, I own it. Mi casa es su casa. I read about it in the Sunday paper. -If it's in print, it's gotta be true. -Absolutely. In the Chicago Tribune they said you were in the Boer War. -No, just sketches and engravings. Engravings? Isn't that how counterfeiters make funny money? Cue the Earps. -Dialogue! -You're under arrest. Don't kill me! I ain't shooting! The fight's commenced. Get to fighting or get out. DIRECTOR: Dialogue, Billy. God, forgive me for all the bad things I've done. DIRECTOR: Cut! -We'll do the close-ups after lunch. -All right, that's lunch. -Okay for me. -Was that really just like it? -Just like it. I want to get Tom's close-ups first. Tom, that was interesting. -No. You handle a six-gun pretty good. -Praise from Caesar. You gotta hit what you shoot at. I just gotta look good. Was that really the way it was? -Absolutely. Give or take a lie or two. -Mr. Earp. Good morning, Miss Shoemaker. -Sure. Honey, I'm gonna propose. If you don't do publicity, I'll lose my job. I don't want that to happen. I'll work it out with Mr. Alperin. I know Alfie. He won't talk until he gets his pound of flesh. Do you mind if I try anyway? -Okay, Mr. Earp. -Would you mind making that Wyatt? Sure, if you make it Nancy. You warm an old man's heart, Nancy. Shame on you, Wyatt, trying to pull that old man stuff on me. Mr. Earp? Chief Dibner wants to see you. -Chief of security. I'll take you. No need. Just point me in the direction. Go down Main Street. Last bungalow on the left. -Sounds easy. Thanks, officer. -You're welcome. Hey, Wyatt. -Chief Dibner wants me. Hold on a minute. -Make him come to you. Because he's a dangerous son of a bitch. You know what they say about bearding a lion in his den. Sometimes the same thing applies to dangerous sons of bitches. You could've made a hell of an actor. Marshalling and acting aren't too far apart. One time, I wasn't packing my six-gun, and Doc Holliday was drunk. He was roaring he was gonna shoot my earlobes off. I went for a hideout gun. Luckily, he thought I had one. -Oh, every word. Give or take a lie or two. Watch yourself, amigo. It's just a Western. Some Indians die, big deal. -Watch your step. -Michael, please! Hold on. Excuse me, but you're in the way of some very dedicated drinking. Well, I'm sorry. Hey! What picture are you in? I'm not. -Name's Earp. Wyatt Earp? Well, I'm Billy the Kid, and she's Calamity Jane. Mary Jane Cannary was a dear woman, but she looked like an unmade bed. -This young lady's much too pretty. -Thank you, Mr. Earp. Mr. Earp is here. I'm Marvin Dibner. Well, have a seat. Apparently, Mrs. Alperin knows you're here in Hollywood. Mrs. Alperin would like you to pay a call on her as a favor. You know who she is? Did you ever meet her? -You don't say much, do you, Wyatt? -No, I don't. Also, it's Mr. Earp. Or Marshal, or even Earp. Not Wyatt until I tell you. And while I think of it don't ever question me again. Just trying to be friendly. You're trying to stay ahead of the game. Your boss's wife wants to talk to me, you want to know why. Probably your boss does, too. My job is to get curious about anything involving Mrs. Alperin. What's bothering you? Your bad manners and the fact you don't hear too good. I told you not to try questioning me. And I meant it. -Thank you. -Thanks, Mr. Earp. First off, don't ever crowd anybody unless you got a first-class reason. Did you do a lot of time, boy? -Folsom. For what? Armed robbery. Make a move, it'll be the mistake of your life. -Oh, yeah. -Marshal Earp to see Mrs. Alperin. If you'll follow me. I'll inform Mrs. Alperin that you're here. Not much like Denver. Mr. Earp, thank you for coming. -I've hoped to see you again. -I wanted to hear from you. It wouldn't have been fitting. I didn't think you'd remember. You've never been forgotten. You are just as I remember. Perhaps taller. -Is it possible that you grew? -Not likely. Then there can only be one explanation. I was wearing high heels. You were. Soft, gray kid high-button shoes. -I undid them. -The buttons were yellow ivory. -Whalebone. That night in Denver, you said... That if you were ever in trouble, I'd come. Let's go outside where we won't be interrupted. Alfie told me you were here, and everyone else is afraid. -Of each other. Of... Of your husband? Yes, I suppose so. They're afraid Alfie might not want me helped. With your son? I met him today at the studio. Yes. I received a letter from a woman I used to know named Candace Girard. She runs a place called the Candy Store. She says Michael hurt one of her girls and I suggests I buy her off. -Rhonda Lopez. Please see her. I've no one to turn to. I'll pay anything. I'm not for hire. I'll do it for the way you held the roses. Christina Alperin a very lovely lady who married the wrong man. Easy to understand. When she met Alfie he didn't want to take over the world. He was still "The Happy Hobo" that people laughed at and loved. I'm here to tell you, Wyatt, when he wanted to be he could be the most charming, considerate giving, funny man. Especially when he wanted something. He sure did want Christina. Aren't you hot? It's open. -The press awaits. -Better get her done, pardner. I explained that you have pressing engagements and must be done by 6:30. -I didn't. Tom's taking me on a tour. Starting with Grauman's Chinese and ending up at the Candy Store. -Good evening, Mr. Mix. -Cheryl. Allow me to introduce Mr. Wyatt Earp. -Yes, I'm not dead yet. I can see that. Promise not to close us down like the saloons in Tombstone. -I never closed a saloon in my life. -Good. -We know what Tom drinks. -I'll have... No, let me guess. A Waterfill and Frazier and a cold Dos Equis to chase. Close enough. CHERYL: How long do you plan to be in town? EARP: As long as I find it interesting. -We'll do what we can to keep you. -I think that'd be nice. -Cheryl. -Miss Alperin. Victoria Alperin, Alfie's kid sister, and... Dutch Kieffer. I'm surprised a marshal knows the Chicago underworld. East or West, a crook is a crook. Did Tom tell you that our ladies all look like famous movie stars? Greta? This is Mr. Wyatt Earp. -It's a pleasure, Mr. Earp. -My pleasure, Ms. Garbo. Amazing resemblance. Yes, and besides Greta, we have Janet Gaynor, Pola Negri and the Gish sisters. I forget you're here on business. Mrs. Alperin wanted me to talk to Candace Girard. I see. About the girl that Michael beat up? Yes. You'll find Candace in the guest cottage. That's where she lives and sometimes entertains. Use the back door. Tom knows the way. Will you be here when I get back? Depends on when you get back. How you doing, pal? Hiya, big boy. Honeysuckle. -You aren't what I expected you to be. I don't know, exactly. A little less civilized. You're not exactly what I expected you to be, either. What exactly did you expect I'd be? Taller, maybe. Candy! It's Tom Mix, honey. Candy! Candy! Cadillac Eight. Recognize it? No. I got a lousy feeling about this. Yeah, I got the same lousy feeling. Candy! Candy? Oh, shit. -Michael Alperin. -Yeah, we met. Get the car. SHERYL: Candy! Open up, it's important. -It's a raid. -Killed her! -Don't go in there! -No! No! -Cheryl, come on! Cheryl! Tom! Get your hat and close this door! -Cheryl! Shut up! -No! Cheryl! Listen to me! Listen to me! Listen! Get down! Get down! Pull yourself together. Go in there and keep your mouth shut. Come on, Tom! -I didn't know you could drive. -I can't. Hey, look out! Close that door, honey. -Get him undressed. Candy Girard was murdered. They're looking for Michael. We gotta keep him here. -I don't think so. -I killed her. -He disagrees. He's drugged. -You mean drunk. -That too. He's gonna be sick again. Towels! -Real sure. -That's sure enough for me. -Honey, come on. Wait, wait. We gotta go. Can you handle this? Sure, I'll just pretend he's my ex. It's gonna be a couple of days. I'll manage. I'll call in sick. I'll call you as soon as I get home. Tom, come on. -Where is he going without his pants? I killed her. God, I hope you're lying. Wyatt. I'm okay. I'm all right. Will you sleep with me? I'm old enough to be your father. You're old enough to be my grandfather. Now answer the question. Yes. I just need to be held. At one time or another, we all do. -Why did you tell Cheryl where I was? -She asked me. I figured if she asked, you'd tell her. -Nope. Grand girl. A grand 26-year-old girl. Could've done myself permanent injury. -About 16. -You got more cars. GUARD: Mr. Mix! Captain Dibner wants you and Mr. Earp to report to his office. Mr. Mix and Mr. Earp. Wyatt Earp, Captain Blackworth, P.D. Tom, you know him. Have a seat. You boys were at the Candy Store last night. -Guess we was. Candace Girard was killed shortly before you left. -Yeah. -Yes, sir. I'm a tequila man. Waterfill and Frazier. You saw a girl. Cheryl. Gotta hand it to you. You sure are up on things. We need to talk to her. She was close with Candy. Real close. Maybe you'd talk at headquarters. So far, you've been telling us things. Ask questions, you'll get answers. What do you know about Candy's murder? Very little. Practically nothing. No idea who killed her? -Could be the man in the black Cadillac. The one that drove out of the alley. -License number. -I forget. Yeah, I forget too. Well, if I was you, I'd damn well try to remember. You'd have trouble remembering when you get pushed hard. Let me give you an example. Why did you raid the Candy Store? It was engaged in the practice of prostitution. That's illegal here. Come on, captain. Candy's been around a long time. It's a gold mine. To stay open, she had to be paying someone a lot of juice. I don't know. That's not my department, that's vice. Well, there you go. That's the way it is in the big city. Everybody's in another department. All nice and legal. Tell me, captain. With all those different departments have you got a department that looks into crooked cops on the take? See? Sometimes you get pushed too hard you got a tendency to forget. Afternoon, Dib. You're not gonna let him get away with that? No. What are you gonna do? I don't know. But I'm gonna love it. Get out of town, Earp. -Smile when you say that, partner. DIRECTOR: Cut! That was great. How'd you like it? Well I thought it was real thrilling. But I've never been in a fight like that in my whole life. -And Buffalo Bill didn't kill Injuns. -You'd win your bet. Bill Cody was a good man, but not as good as his publicity. Like a movie star cowboy I know. I get the impression you're not comfortable being a famous cowboy movie star. What would you say if I told you when Teddy Roosevelt and his rough riders were charging up San Juan Hill, I was in Muskogee busting broncs. I'd say that you and I were a whole lot alike. Part fact and just enough fiction to sell newspapers. I guess nobody's entirely comfortable being anything. I think the trick is to know the fact, and don't believe the fiction. Tell me about Captain Blackworth. Known far and wide as "Dirty Bernie." Not a nice piece of work. -I get the feeling he'd like to kill one of us. Maybe both. If it's me, I'm counting on you to avenge me. -Oh, no. Too early. Says you. This morning, I need some help. Do you know a girl named Rhonda Lopez? -Alleged to have beat up. Met her once or twice. Can't say I got know her. -Tom! Gone. I tried to reason with him but he just walked out. -No, in your pajamas and one of my coats. -Tequila. You know I don't drink tequila. He took $5 out of my purse and called a cab. I tried to reach you but you'd already left the studio. -Checkered, I think. -Don't know where he took it? Maybe. We gotta be careful how we do it. We don't want the cab company calling the police. -Arthur. -What the hell did you run into? Mr. Alperin would like Mr. Earp to have lunch with him. I'm sorry we couldn't meet sooner, Mr. Earp. But I've been out having business meetings all week. Twelve, sometimes 15 hours a day. Couldn't even take time out for lunch till now. You must enjoy your work. Most of the time it's a real challenge. Keeps me on my toes. Keeps me young. -Have you ever seen any of my pictures, Mr. Earp? -A few. My biggest problem is staying in shape. Not like it was when I was an acrobat. These days I have to steal time just to work out. I've found that a strong, agile, average man can nearly always beat a strong, clumsy, big man. Now, you take, for example, Arthur. You remember Arthur, my chauffeur who was unsuccessful in preventing you from seeing my wife. Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr. Earp. I'm not opposed to you seeing my wife, if she wants to see you. I'm opposed to people not doing their jobs. It was Arthur's job to stop you. Even if he knew I was expected? But he didn't. That's the point. So the strong, agile, average man showed the strong, big, clumsy man. The error of his ways. Exactly. -Arthur must love his job. -Arthur has no choice. He's on parole to me. There is nothing more important than the welfare and safety of my family. Which brings us to the reason that you saw my wife. -I understand that she asked you to help Michael. I've been told the police suspect that Michael may have murdered Candice Girard. If you really want to help, Mr. Earp I suggest you get him to turn himself in. I'll try. Good. Where is he? Why would I know? You were at the Candy Store. I presumed you must've seen him, helped him. To hide, to get away? If he did kill Candice Girard, that would make me an accessory. However, I did see another member of your family. Your sister Victoria on the arm of Dutch Kieffer. What is it that you want? To do whatever I can to help Christina. Why? Because she asked. That's okay, we've gotta go anyway. Hey Marvin, how are you? -Call me. -And me too. I got a favor to ask you. I want you to tell Dirty Bernie to lay off Wyatt. He wouldn't listen to me. You don't want to get Earp mad enough to blow down Alfie's house of cards, would you? Expose him for what he is. Turn down my favor. Pick your lard ass up out of that chair and walk out of here and you'll find out. Go ahead, Marvin. Take that chance. -I'll see what I can do. -Not good enough. Either do it or don't. Get it? Have a nice day, Dib. How was your lunch? The man is crazy. Underneath all that happy lovability and charm is a brutal sadist. -It's been spotted. Nobody's been able to prove it although it's a topic of conversation in the industry. Okay, I've got some bad news. We just got a report that Michael has been arrested and booked for the murder of Candice Girard. Only a matter of time before they locate the cab driver who picked him up in front of you place. The minute they tie you into this, you're in danger. We gotta get you out of town honey. -Go to the ranch. -And don't go home. Let me borrow your car. What's the next move? -He don't know how to drive. This time I gotta stop you. Tell your boss to go to hell, Arthur. I'll talk to the parole board. -They'll listen to him. -He's worse than Folsom. -Nothing's worse. -I gotta see Mrs. Alperin. Mr. Earp, please come in. It's all right, Arthur. I'll explain to Mr. Alperin. Tell your boss I pulled a gun on you. Tom called. He said you were on your way. -Tell me about Michael. -I don't think so. -I'll try. -There's something else. -No. It's not just Michael. -Please! Mr. Earp, If I knew you were coming to see Christina I'd have given you a ride. I asked him to come by. Saved you the trouble of pulling that gun on poor old Arthur. Darling, shouldn't you be in bed? I'm much better. Christina took a nasty fall yesterday. Luckily no bones broken, huh? The doctor strongly recommended that she stay in bed for the next few days. I know how worried you are about Michael. Please, for my sake, you've simply got to take more care of yourself. Now, go on. Back to bed. I'm sure Mr. Earp will understand. Thank you, Mr. Earp. I'll be up shortly. You know, Mr. Earp... At first, I considered you to be a good investment, but lately you've become more trouble than you're worth. If anything happens to Christina you're gonna have to come up with a new definition of trouble. I'll try and come up this weekend. What am I gonna do for clothes? We'll get you the clothes you need. Asuncion will get you what you need. -The housekeeper. Listen. Under no conditions are you to leave the ranch, you understand? I do. -This is serious. -Okay. -Get in. -Ohhh. -Yes, sir. Don't stop for anything and check to make sure nobody's following you. They only built 141 of these babies and it could outrun anything on four wheels. You know how hard it is being in competition with a horse and 16 cars. Nancy, I'd rather be with you than almost any car. What about your horse? -Don't answer that. -Get her going, George. -What are you gonna do without me? -Whatever I can to help Wyatt. Bye. Candy's my mother. She thought I looked cute and provocative in men's clothing. She knew people would assume we were lovers. And... And I wouldn't have to entertain. I expect that's why Dirty Bernie's looking for me. It's Candy's customers. Various notations on their lifestyles and preferences. Who is "Hellman, Robert"? The mayor. Enough in here to get a lot of important people in a lot of important trouble. You knew about most of these things? Yes. According to this, Michael's a lot like his father. No, not really. Michael's basically passive unless he drinks. But, Alfie... He enjoys hurting people. There are some interesting things about Dutch Kieffer and Victoria. Yeah. She likes women, and he likes to watch. You're a long way from Tombstone, marshal. Where can I find Dutch Kieffer? Well you could try the Kit Kat Club. -There you go. -Thank you very much, sir. Hi, Tom. May I take your hat? Who the hell let you in? Ladies. -The door was open. -There's a doorbell. I rang it. -Nobody answered. -You could've knocked. How well did you know Candy Girard? What the hell business is it of yours? You may not like this, Victoria, but I'm making it my business. My houseman was the Australian light heavyweight boxing champion. He's going to kick your ass all the way to Pasadena. -Well, in the meantime... -There is no "in the meantime." You were at the candy store the night she was murdered. So were you. So were a lot of people. So what? You think your nephew killed her? How the hell do I know? Maybe. In case you hadn't noticed, Michael's a serious lush. When he's drunk, he's been known to beat up women. Maybe that's what happened with Candy. Maybe he lost control and killed her. Maybe. As anybody could see, you're all broken up about it. Son of a bitch! Somebody with a real bad temper killed Candy. Hurt him. Really hurt him. I recognize you. You're Tom Mix, the movie star. I hear you've sparred with Jack Dempsey. Come on, mate. Let's see what you've learned. -Yeah, okay. Marquess of Queensberry. Ow! I gotta go look. -Come on! -Smash his face in! Damn you! Son of a bitch! -Yeah. Compliments of Mr. Jack Dempsey. Ladies. You wait till I tell my brother! You'll never work in this town again! The guy is still out cold. You sure? Well, I kicked him. He didn't seem to mind. He knows it was your Cadillac. He knows you were at the Candy Store the night Candy was killed. You better figure out what to do with him before the club opens. I know what. I just haven't decided how. I'll be home. When you're finished, call the station. Get the car and bring it around. Give us a hand. There's no "us." I'm out of this. You just give advice, huh? In this case, right. In this case, wrong. You're in this up to your badge. You stop playing cozy or you're gonna end up on a hook in somebody's meat locker. -You can't intimidate me, Dutch. -The fuck I can't. -Not that big. Trespassing. Assault. -That can get you hard time. -Not if I shoot the witnesses. I doubt you'll do that. You had me whipped and tied like a calf ready to be branded. Yeah, I did that. You broke in. I don't know who you are. I know who you are, Dutch. If I was some unknown trespasser you'd have called the police instead of tying me up and leaving me down there while trying to figure out what to do with me. That's Captain Blackworth of the police department. I know who he is. Then do what you gotta do. Gun or no gun, I'm gonna call your bluff and walk. When Captain Blackworth recovers I want you to persuade him to lay off Cheryl. -I don't have that kind of influence with the captain. -I think you do. Anyway, you try. Because if Cheryl has any trouble with Blackworth, or you, or anybody the DA is gonna get a certain black book. I don't know what you're talking about. -You're wasting time again. -I don't know about any black book. Drop it! I'll kill you. Now, about that, I have influence. If he doesn't drop it by the time I count three you kill him. One. Two. Now, what I got here is a 12-gauge, full-choke shotgun. Go ahead and count three. Let's see who gets killed first. Your call. Okay, I've made my point. You can take it or leave it. Sorry we're on opposite sides. Well, that's usually the case. And if you touch me again, I'll kill you. Likewise, Mr. Earp. In an actor's world, things aren't what they seem. A pauper is a prince. Or a shotgun is a mop. -You'll have to give this up. You're gonna get yourself killed. People been saying that to me for 50 years. You think we can we go someplace quiet where we can talk? Sure. Hey, Mix! Come on! Hola, Maria Chiquita. -Sure, baby. Tom Mix. I don't give a damn who he is! He broke in, he wrecked the place and he insulted me! I want his damn legs broken! He practically accused me of killing Candy! Look, shut up. Did you hear what I said? All right, I heard you. Jesus. -Hello. -I'm at El Coyote. Mix just came in with Earp and the girl. There are a couple stunt riders here that think Mix is a phony. If the price is right they might enjoy proving it. I'll be home in an hour. Let me know what happens. Right. Well, are you going to take care of Mix or do I have to tell Dutch? What I do is my business. -You're not gonna tell Dutch anything. -The hell I'm not. -Except what I want you to tell him. -Oh please, no. Otherwise, you're gonna have two gimpy legs, little sister. You're gonna go home. You're gonna call the cops. Tell them that Tom Mix beat you up, then raped you. They'll never believe me. They'll believe you. I want you to cry a lot and show them the bruises. Alfie! And they'll believe you. Bravo! Ole! Ride her, partner. Bravo! Arriba! Bravo! You were wonderful. Where did you learn to dance like that? When I was younger, I fell in love with an exceptional lady from Buenos Aires who believed a man wasn't a complete lover unless he tangoed. -Didn't give you much choice. -I took lessons for a year. What was this lady's vocation? She was a tango instructor. -Hundred percent. Give or take a lie or two. -To honest men. -And brave women. And friendships, tried and true. Hello, boys. We seen your circus wagon parked outside thinking we'd come in and tell you right to your face. -You're a half-breed candy ass. Not exactly a hot bulletin. That's why we hire fearless high-spirited stuntmen like yourselves. Why don't you boys mosey to the bar and buy a drink on me. -We don't want a drink on you. -We'll buy the little lady a round. How about it, little lady? You want to have a drink with real men instead of a half-breed candy ass and his granddaddy? Before you make two big fools of yourselves I suggest you look under the table. Do what? I'd do what he says. This here's Wyatt Earp, famous lawman who's been known to carry a pearl-handled colt pistol which I just bet he snuck out of his holster while you boys are trying to pick a fight. Yeah, right. I know who he is. He didn't come in packing no hog leg. -I thought you were looking at my car. -We wasn't. Wyatt Earp or no Wyatt Earp I bet you don't have a gun under the table. It's your funeral. -I'm going to kill you! -One move and I'll pig-stick you! Now, take my advice and run, while you still have your cojones. Hey, Mix, baby! Hello, Tom. Let's take a walk, Dib. Excuse me, darling. Me and Marvin got important business to discuss. -Walk or I'm gonna bust your fuckin' arm. -Can the bullshit. You set me up with those stuntmen. -Tom, l... -You listen to me, you lying sack of shit. I asked you for a favor. Now I'm telling you. Get Alfie to lay off Wyatt or so help me God the next time this happens I'm gonna rope your fat ass and drag it the length of Sunset Boulevard. Ain't gonna be enough hide on you to patch a pinhole, you got it? Yeah. Just counseling the chief on the error of his ways. I don't know what he told you, Dibner. Since I'm a little more civilized than him, I want to get my two cents worth. From here on, you give me trouble, I'll kill you, understand? -Yes. -Say it. Convince me. -Anymore trouble, you'll kill me. -I believe you. So from now on, whether you live or die is up to you. Excuse me. Can I go to the bathroom? Hold on a second, we gotta get something straight. I threatened to rope him behind my horse and drag him and you waltz in here and threatened to kill him. -I don't like being out-threatened. -Sorry. Won't happen again. Bad as being upstaged. I'm a movie star. What are you doing here? You were supposed never to come to this house. We had an agreement. Had an agreement. What in the hell is that supposed to mean? Any agreement didn't include you beating Victoria. What -She did. She fingered Mix, but I know what really happened. And how do you know? A year ago we made a deal. I don't deal with anyone I don't know everything about. I know who and what you are. I knew a guy like you when I was starting. Cocky guy. Wore spats and a derby all the time. He used to brag about how smart he was. Till someone shot him in the mouth. If Mix is arrested for assault and rape, what happens to his movie? I'll close down for a few days. We'll recast. Tom Mix will be washed up. Provided he's found guilty. Doesn't matter. The press will find him guilty. Blackworth's arresting Mix is okay. But not until I get Candy's little black book. -Nancy Shoemaker. Mix is hiding her up at his ranch. Hello, George. A woman called, but wouldn't leave her name. She sounded disturbed. You didn't recognize the voice? It was English. It could have been Miss Alperin. She asked for you. When I told her you were out, she asked if you could be reached. I'll get it. Hello. -Tom. This is Christina. Dutch Kieffer knows you've got Nancy up at the ranch... Strap on your shooting iron, pardner. We gotta go save Nancy. This here is my buddy! -Wyatt, Cheryl! -Hi! What about the funeral? What if you're not there? If we're not back in time, take Cheryl to the funeral and stay with her! Come on, Wyatt! We gotta go! -Nope! Me neither! -It's still dark! -It'll be dawn in 10 minutes! Fasten your seat belt! How much further? About 50 miles. Aw! Oh, shit! What do you think you're doing, mister? Mostly trying to stay alive. Hey, I know you. -Ain't you... -Yeah. That's Tom Mix. Yep. Wyatt, I want you to meet... What are your boys names? -This here is Henry. -And this here is Fred. Henry, Fred, I want you to meet Wyatt Earp. Morning, boys. -Now you're on the Circle C. You're only about 15 miles southeast of your spread. Well, we sure would appreciate the loan of a couple fast horses. Damned old flu. I'm getting to where I can't even stay on a horse. Go on! Hey, what do you want? What do you want? Let go of me, you big bastard! -I'd feel a hell of a lot better if they was a camera. Let's get her done. Get in the car! Get in there and shut up! Spread out! MAN: Get off me! My God! Wyatt. Well, you done good, pardner. Of course, a couple more inches... To ensure the resurrection to eternal life through our Lord, Jesus Christ, we commend thee, Almighty God, our sister, Candace Girard, and we commit her body to the ground. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. -Amen. -ALL: Amen. Bless you, my child. Cheryl King? Yes. I would've given you this sooner, but I couldn't find you, my card. If you need help, please call. I'm sorry. -A man gave me this envelope. -Open it. You know a Leo Vogel, attorney? No. It's a safety deposit box key. Glad you boys finally showed up. What are you doing here, Blackworth? I'm about to arrest America's favorite movie-star cowboy for felonious assault and rape, unless you try to stop me. And I hope you do. Rape? You've got to be kidding. Who am I supposed to have raped? You'll find out all about that at the station. Let's go. I'm primed. You wanna take him? I'd like to, but he's not worth it. You bit off more than you can chew, asshole. -Don't bet on it. -Call my lawyer, Saul Rosenstein. I'll be all right, honey. You go with them. Normally I'd run you and your lesbo girlfriend out of town, but you made some dangerous enemies here. I'm looking forward to what's gonna happen when they catch up with you. How's your nose? You better get out of here, Blackworth, before I forget I'm a lawman. You know, I don't think you killed half those men you say you did. And the ones you did kill, I bet you shot them in the back. Let's find out, you son of a bitch. Draw. My men will cut you to ribbons. Not before I shoot out your eyes. Another time. -No. Why? I'm not packing a gun. -I sure am, pardner. Tom, you need a new sidekick? Can I get you anything, Mr. Mix? Naw, I don't expect to be here long. Don't count on it. -Hello, Michael. How are you, boy? -Not very well. -Mind if I ask you a question? -Yes, I was framed. Who'd do that? Whoever got the bartender to slip me a mickey, then made sure I went over to Candy's. -And you found her dead. -No. No, she said, "Never trust an Alperin," then she died. I suppose she was trying to name the killer, huh? But unfortunately she just didn't have enough time to be specific. Well, you can take your pick, though. I mean, there are four Alperins. Well, three, if my mother decides to narrow the field. What do you mean? You didn't hear? She's in the hospital. She's not expected to live. How much do you think there is? Maybe this'll help. "Hi, baby. "The man who gave you this key is an old friend "and a good lawyer. "If you need any help or advice after you read this, give him a call. "They say that confession is good for the soul, "so here it goes. "On August 11th, 1916 "I was a guest aboard Alfie Alperin's yacht, "which was returning from Catalina, "I witnessed Alfie Alperin fighting with his first wife. "Then he hit her, and pushed her overboard. "When he saw me, "I was sure he was going to kill me. "Instead, "he led me to his cabin, where he beat me "and raped me. "Afterwards, he said that if I kept my mouth shut "he would set me up in business. "Now, baby, I want you to give this... "...give this letter to the district attorney. "It will protect you." NEWSMAN: It's an exciting evening, ladies and gentlemen. We expect a gala turnout tonight of major stars. Arriving now is Mr. Alfie Alperin. No statement right now, okay? The press conference is all set. Any other news? What's wrong? Mix and Wyatt are at the hospital. Can they hurt you? I better get dressed. So silly, losing my balance and falling over like that. Is that you, Tom? Yes, Christina. I saw Michael. He sends his love. -He didn't kill that girl, did he, Wyatt? -No. No, I'm sure Alfie killed her, just like I'm sure he did this to you. Why do you protect him? Because... He's not Michael's father. He promised me that if I married him, he'd raise Michael as his own son. I guess for a while he even tried. But the thought of another man... Then, when the doctor told him that we... That he couldn't have children, he grew to hate Michael. I did everything I could to protect him. What about Michael's real father? He never knew. I don't seem to have had much luck with my men, have I, Wyatt? I'm so tired. Try to rest. He'll never bother you again, my dear. Welcome to the first annual Academy Awards. Before we start handing out our little statuettes, I wanna introduce an entrepreneur, a brilliant clown who retired his tuxedo coat and baggy pants and is now one of Hollywood's most successful producers. Known by millions of his adoring fans as "The Happy Hobo": Mr. Alfie Alperin. Landmark in Hollywood history, ladies and gentlemen. Arriving now, we can see Tom Mix. But who's that he's got in the car with him? It's Wyatt Earp! Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for remembering. Congratulations to all of us here today for being here to celebrate this most important event for our industry. As some of you know, my dearest wife, Christina, is seriously ill in the hospital. So unfortunately, I'm gonna have to leave before you honor the winners. Let me just say this in parting: have fun, enjoy yourselves, and all those of you who are working my studio, at Alperin, especially the ladies, don't stay up too late, all right? Enjoy yourselves. God bless. Have fun. Alperin? I'm taking you in. And what makes you think you can you do that? You're not the law here. No, just a citizen making sure a murderer doesn't escape. I'll shoot if I have to. You're insane. This is Candace Girard's confession that she witnessed you murder your first wife. You're making a scene, Mr. Earp. Walk with me to the stairs. If I don't? I killed Candy. I've got nothing to lose. -Victoria. -Go on, Alfie. Get out of here, Alfie. Walk to the stairs. You couldn't have beaten Candace up like that. What happened, you and Dutch find her after Alfie got through with her? Finish her off with an ice pick? And I loved every minute of it. Hold it right there, Earp. Get your hands up. Get away from him, Miss Alperin. Dib, get his gun. We got a report from Paso Robles police. Four men were killed at Mix's ranch. -Yep. Sure. I killed them. Well, two of them. Tom got the other two. -I arrest you for murder. -Let's go. Get back! -Get out of the way, Bernie. -He can't do that. -Shut up! -No. -Vickie. -He can hurt Alfie and I'm not going to let him. -But not like this. -Not like this. Let us take care of him. -She killed Candy. Alfie has paid you a fortune. Now just go down the stairs! -There's too many witnesses. -Shut up! -Miss Alperin... -Victoria! -No, Dutch. It's gone too far. Go away. -Oh, Christ. -You son of a bitch! No! Dutch! -Dutch, give me the gun. -Tom, go get Alfie. It hurts. Why did you kill Candy? She was gonna tell about what happened on the boat. I had to protect Alfie. You don't understand, do you? Sometimes bad people like me and Alfie only have each other. Daddy. Daddy... Go on! Don't slow down for anything. Get me to the boat as fast as you can. -Did you hear about Mrs. Alperin? -No. It was on the radio. She died. Just step on it! I think we're being followed. Come on. Can't you shake him? Just get me to the boat quickly. It's all I ask. You stop this goon behind us or you're gonna see the inside of Folsom for a long time. Do you hear me, Arthur? Do you hear me? Where are you going? What are you doing? Come on, you passed the boat. Hey! Son of a bitch! No! No! No! No! -Help! Help! -Shit! -I can't swim! -Hang on, Arthur! Help! Help! Relax! -I'm all right. -Better call the police. I'm sorry about that, Arthur. You'd have drowned us both. You should have let me drown. They're gonna put me away for life! -Yeah. Then why don't you start? Keep walking till you find a place you feel like settling down and starting a new life. You mean it? Hey, I'm the hero, Arthur. I always mean what I say. Thanks. Por nada, amigo. Get going. You know something, pardner? You're developing a real knack for upstaging me. Some folks would rest a whole lot easier if you burned this. On the other hand, I could open up the candy store again and have the mayor cut the ribbon. That you could. Got a match? CONDUCTOR: All aboard! Come back. You never know. Now you take care of that big guy, will you? -I'll miss you. -And I'll miss you. Michael. I'll tell you like I told your mother a long time ago. If you ever need any help, you know where to find me. Yes, sir. CONDUCTOR: All aboard! So long, pardner. Adios, amigo.
