Can't we just find a motel and pull over? Look, if we continue driving all night, we're gonna be in Tulsa by morning, okay? Okay. I'm hungry. Why don't you and your mom go to the diner and get yourself a slice of pie. Get me a coffee, too. Okay. Okay, honey. Come on. Let's go. I'm hungry, too. Can I get, like, a hot chocolate or something? Yeah, yeah. Get a good night's sleep. Yeah. All right. Look, baby, they got pecan pie. I don't like pecan. Since when? Since summer. Okay. What can I get you folks? Blueberry pie, please. Would you like a scoop of ice cream with that? Yes, ma'am. And two coffees. Coming right up. [emergency alert blaring] What is it, Mom? I don't know. [wind whistling] [announcer] The Emergency Weather Service has issued an urgent weather message for Erath county and surrounding areas. At 11:30 p.m., Central Standard Time, Emergency Weather Service Doppler radar indicated a severe thunderstorm capable of producing a tornado. This storm is located 20 miles southwest of Stephenville, Texas, and moving northeast at 45 miles per hour. Tom! Come on! Let's go! We've got to get out. There's a shed in the back. Dad, I'm scared. Honey, I'm right here. I promise I will not let anything happen to you. Sir, we gotta get out of here! Trust me. Please. Let's go. Let's go! Come on! [Mom] Oh! Oh, no! Back! Back! Back! [Mom] Run, honey! Here we go. Here we go. Over here. Come on! Come on! Get in here! Get in, get in, get in! Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up! [screaming, whimpering] Is it gone? I don't know. I'm gonna... I'm gonna go take a look. Be careful. [phone buzzing] [woman] Ethan? Ethan. Yeah. Yeah, I'll get it. I'll get it. [phone buzzing] Yeah. What? When? Okay. All right. Get the satellite data started, and I'll be in as soon as I can. All right. Bye. It's not even 3:00 in the morning. Twister hit Dublin. What? May as well get up now. Deb's call is coming any second. Before I forget, Happy Anniversary. You need to brush your teeth. Yeah, um... How about we drop the kids off at your mother's and I could grill us some steaks and maybe buy us a bottle of wine. I can't. I'm on assignment. Remember? The Fort Worth Holiday Parade? But we can celebrate this weekend. I promise. I'll make it up to you. Is Logan gonna be there? [sighs] Don't. I'm just askin'. Why does it matter? Look, I know we have our problems, and he's funny and charming. Yeah, we do have our problems. That's true. But that is not one of them. [phone ringing] You should answer your phone. [sighs] Ethan... [sighs] Hey, Deb. [chuckles] Go back to bed. Dad? What's going on? I've got to run to work for a little bit. Does Mom have to go to work, too? Probably. Have your sister drop you off. But remember, come home right after school. You're still grounded. Oh, Dad... Max, you gotta learn. When your mom tells you you can't do something, you can't do it. But I wearing safety goggles and gloves. Doesn't it look cool? I did the Wise Men and everything. It actually looks really cool. But you were specifically told not to touch my tools. [sighs] Fine. Get some sleep. All right? And good luck on your report. [kisses] Thanks. I have the reports on the storm last night. Oh, I'm sorry. That's okay. Thanks. Also, thank you for the opportunity to let me join your team. Professor Collins said it would be the best way to get the experience I need, and your theories on the impact of climate change on local weather patterns are phenomenal. Zoe... Chloe. Chloe, it's early. Easy on the caffeine. Oh, okay. Zack! What did I tell you about playing games in here? Hey, Doc. How's Christmas like tornado season? I don't know. How is Christmas like tornado season? You get a tree in your living room. I like that one. The dual polarity radar is up and running. Yeah? So, what are we looking at? We're still waiting for the Emergency Weather Service to confirm, but our sensors clocked it at 130. One-thirty. Have you double-checked? Unfortunately, we're short-staffed because of the winter break, but Chloe was running the data, aren't you, Chloe? Yes. Yep, I am right on it. [chuckles] So what else can you tell me? She's a little high-strung, but, uh, I like her. The storm, Zack. Gas station, diner, uh, demolished, but no one was hurt. Let's fire up the algorithms, see what else is out there. Yep, you got it, Doc. Here you go. The Dublin twister was confirmed at 132 miles per hour. An F2. In December. F2? Is that bad? That's a fairly large storm. See, we have a scale, and F0 being the low end, that would knock over a few trees and rearrange your garden gnomes pretty good. And on the high end? F5. That's like total destruction. Is there anything bigger, like an F6? Oh, no. That would have to be I don't know... 318 miles per hour? That's like a nuclear bomb going off. Oh, my God! This is, like, from last Christmas? Hey, that's the expensive stuff. I'll make you a fresh one, Dr. Walker. It's gonna be a long day. You know what they say about the early bird. Better involve a pay raise. Here's the info on last night's storm. Hit a couple farms on the east side of town. No fatalities. Minor injuries. What kind of injuries? Two sprained legs and one fractured wrist. You brought me here in the middle of the night for that? Is that news? This ain't Chicago, honey. A kid shot some footage of the twister from his bedroom window. Let Terry know about this. I thought you were on leave. It's my last day. Don't leave without saying goodbye. You gonna miss me? I am. I'm gonna miss you, too! I told her she was wasting your time. The sky sucked that baby back up 20 minutes ago. Good. Then you can go on air and tell everyone it's over. Get powdered up. You're live in five. You tell Ethan about New York? [sighing] Logan... It's a big three affiliate, six o'clock desk. They've won five Emmys. It's a huge opportunity for both of us, Addison. Unless you like covering tractor pulls and rodeos. Don't forget how much you gave up to come here for him. Chicago was a great station. Good money... It was a mutual decision. Of course, after what happened, he really didn't have much of a choice. Texas is our home now, Logan. Well, I'm going with or without you. We make a great team, and you know that. I'm not having this conversation now. A tornado hit the small town of Dublin late last night, destroying a small gas station and an adjacent diner, both of which were open at the time. There are currently no reports of any serious injuries or any additional destruction. That can't be good. Hey, Doc? Doc! Do you see the rapid rotation in the updraft there? That is a hook echo, I'm sure of it. Hook echo? What's a hook echo? A hook echo is a radar signature. It's usually rain or hail showing that a storm cell could produce a tornado. But wouldn't the Emergency Weather Service have said something? No, because it's being obscured by the precipitation. Look. See beneath the anvil? It's hiding. That wouldn't show up on their systems. That is a massive supercell system. I don't get it. It's almost Christmas. Tornado season's not until March. Usually you would be correct. December temperatures are typically too mild to produce strong storm systems, except... thanks to climate change, the ocean temperature is five degrees warmer, which means the air that comes off the Gulf of Mexico is something you'd find closer to, say, April. And since the water levels are higher... The jet streams and the updrafts are faster. Creating stronger storms. [Ethan] Yeah. Thanks to years of abuse, the environment has finally reached a breaking point. Looks like tornado season's coming early. Run it through the simulation and get speed and direction. Yep. You got it, Doc. Chloe. Call the Storm Prediction Center and ask for Ted. I want you to forward him our data. [Chloe] Sure thing. Hi, this is Chloe Palmer... So as you can see, we have a high pressure system moving in, which means things should start to improve into the morning hours, while our Christmas heat wave continues. "Things should start to improve"? Is he looking at the same data that we are? Nineties Saturday and Sunday. Dry weather is expected to continue... Hey. Someone's got to tell them they're wrong. The only exception being in our far eastern zones today, where a few isolated showers are possible. Get your umbrellas out. As a reminder, we will have a level orange air pollution watch in effect until Tuesday... [phone buzzing] We have a high pressure system moving in, which means... Now is not a good time, Ethan. He's wrong, Addison. Look, if this is about trying to one-up him, we can have this conversation later. There's a hook echo. It's hiding behind precipitation. His computer's just not picking it up. Please just let him do his job. His job. The guy's a personal trainer with a weather map. I'm looking at three different satellites, and I'm telling you, there's a potential for a major outbreak. You mean like before? Do you really want a repeat of what happened? Isn't it better to be safe than sorry? Ethan, I can't get sucked into another one of these wild-goose chases. I just can't. Is she on the phone? Get her off the phone. Deb, can you get her off the phone, please? [sighing] Look, can we talk about this later? This is nothing like Chicago. People have to be warned. I'll talk to you later. It's like I have three children. What happened in Chicago? Let's just say that his theories on climate change haven't always been accurate. Now back to you, Addison. Thank you, Logan. I'm sure many people out there will be very happy to hear the worst is over. In other news, Fort Worth is preparing for their annual holiday parade tonight, and Santa Claus himself will be serving as grand marshal. To help commemorate the occasion, Dinky's Dogs and Cones will be serving free egg nog and peppermint ice cream cones. Good girl, Ashlee. Maybe we shouldn't go to school today. Well, Logan just said everything's gonna be better, so you have nothing to worry about. What am I doing for lunch? Who am I, Mom? Scavenge something from your friends. You could make me lunch like she does. You're not capable of slapping a couple pieces of bread together? Mom makes paninis. Buy a panini. They're not the same as Mom's. Hurry up. We're gonna be late. You know we're having a heat wave? I have to give my science report today. It's my lucky sweatshirt. Fine. You want to overheat, not my problem. Bye, Ashlee. Are Mom and Dad gonna get divorced? Where did that come from? You see how they are. They're fine, Max. They fight almost every day. That's what married people do. They fight. Maybe, but they never laugh afterward like they used to. I heard Mom on the phone talking about a job interview. So? In New York. Look. It's the last day before Christmas break. Let's not worry about it now, okay? Fine. Doesn't feel like Christmas. ♪ O'er the fields we go Laughing all the way ♪ ♪ Bells on bobtail... ♪ Huh. Ah, shoot. Come on, baby. Oh, baby. What the... Wow! Come on. Come on! [yelling] [grunting, screaming] [alarm blaring] Oh, what's that mean? It's another funnel. What's the clock? 140 miles per hour. Solid F2. They're getting stronger. Zack, coordinates. 33.03 degrees north and 96.97 degrees west. Is this what you were expecting? I'm afraid this may only be the beginning. I got that simulation up for you, Doc. I think you're right. I think there's bad mojo coming off this storm. Would you look at that. Oh, my God. I think your kids will be fine. Call me on the CB if you need me. CB? Yeah, it's a smart phone without the smart. Or the phone. Okay. Okay, out. Where are you really going? School, dork. Now get going before you're late. Really? You're going to school? Without a bag? If you say anything to Mom or Dad, you can walk to school from now on. Then I'll be seeing you at 2:30 sharp, right? Can't you sign up for extracurricular activities like a normal kid? I suppose I could call Mom and ask her to pick me up. 2:30. Be waiting when I get here. This just came in from your husband. Thanks. [phone ringing] Hey, Ethan. Yeah, I just got it. Do you want to tell me what I'm looking at? A collision of two major fronts. According to our data, we're looking at the possibility of a severe tornado outbreak within the next three hours. An outbreak? It already started. In Stephenville, a tornado touched down 15 minutes ago. What? Hey, Joanna. Did you hear anything about a tornado touching down in Stephenville? No, I'll check. Thanks. If this is the case, why isn't anyone else picking up on it? Because they're using outdated forecast models. If they'd update their models and take the increased December temperature into account, they'd see that the conditions are right for the perfect storm. Look, Ethan, I know that this is your issue that climate change is affecting the weather, but... this has gotten us into trouble before. I know, I know, and I live with that every day. But this time I'm right. You've gotta trust me. County sheriff confirmed reports of a tornado three miles outside of Stephenville. You see? Thanks. Where are you? On my way to get the kids. Is that a good idea? It's the last day before winter break. They have a lot of work to do. After everything that we went through, you have to know that I wouldn't do this unless I was absolutely certain that it was necessary. Where you gonna take them? Your mom's got a storm shelter. They can wait it out there. How far out are you? About 20 minutes. They're not answering their phones, so I'm guessing that they're still in class. Well, call me as soon as you get 'em, okay? Addison, you gotta go on air, you gotta warn people. Tell them. I will talk to Logan. Talk to Logan. Will you at least promise me that if anything happens, you'll go into the storm shelter at the studio? I will. I promise. No matter what? Fine. I'll call you when I have the kids. Okay. Bye. Yeah, no, I prefer to travel on Saturday. [Logan] I'm sure she will be pleased. All right. Okay. I'll call you back. Great news, Addison. There's a tornado in Stephenville. I know. We told everyone it was over. It was. It is. Look at the charts. Temperature readings, air flow, pressure systems. Nothing to support what happened. No one saw this coming. Ethan did. Ethan got lucky. He's a crusader, Addy. I know that you said he's changed since Chicago. But I've got to go on the air every day and give thousands of people the most accurate information that I can. Do I need to remind you what happened last time? They evacuated an entire town. Well, isn't it better to be safe than sorry? There were thousands of people, Addy, and nothing happened. That doesn't mean he can't be right this time. These temperature increases are nothing to be alarmed about. They're all part of a natural cycle. In fact, some of the hottest dates ever recorded were in the earliest part of the 20th century. Okay, well, I'm gonna ask Deb to run a crawl. You don't want to hear the good news? I was just talking to Cramer. They're going to offer you the position. New York? The big affiliate? This is an amazing opportunity. I don't want to go without you. Can we talk about this later? They'd like an answer today. ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year ♪ ♪ Good tidings we bring to you and your kin ♪ ♪ Good tidings for Christmas and a Happy New Year ♪ Gosh, almost gave up on you.

Yeah, he said he had a bio midterm, but he should be here by 11:00. How do you know that? 'Cause I told him you were gonna be here. What? You liking him is about as big of a secret as him liking you. We're just good friends. Okay, news flash: a hot 17-year-old jock asks for help with his homework is looking for more than just a friend, okay? It was just one time. Maybe he wants another. Someone told you something. I can't reveal my sources. Hey, I got an idea. What? Just come with me. Hey, Mom, working hard at school! After tornado activity early this morning in Dublin, and more recently in Stephenville, we are currently issuing a tornado watch for northwest Tarrant County. Lexi, no. It will make the best four minutes of this guy's life. Hi, Santa. Hi. [Lexi, Kaitlyn laughing] What do you young ladies want for Christmas? Well, um, Kaitlyn would like... a date with Bryan Collins. I'm so sorry. Tell you what. How about we take a nice picture, and Santa will see what he can do about that. Okay? Sounds so good. Santa's gonna get you a date. [Kaitlyn laughing] [Santa] Say cheese. Cheese. [Lexi, Kaitlyn laughing] [Lexi] Bye, Santa. Let's see what damage we can do to my parents' credit. I don't know, Gage. Maybe Ollie was wrong. There's nothing out here but cows. I'm telling you, man, this is the right spot. She's out there. I can smell it. I can't see how. You haven't showered in three days. We just passed Dry Branch. Coming up on Campbell. Maybe you're reading that thing wrong. You read it then! Hey, look! Whoa! Did you see that? Did I see it? I'm getting it in HD! We're too close! Are you kidding me? When Ollie gets a look at this footage, he's gonna lay a golden egg. Hey, um, we got a tornado touchdown on 377. Repeat: touchdown on 377. It's turning away! Keep shooting! Gage? What is it? [train horn blowing] Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop! Dude, we're gonna make a fortune on YouTube. Ethan's been right all morning, which is more than I can say for him. The Storm Prediction Center said conditions warrant a watch. Well, the SPC is wrong. People need to know that this is gonna get a lot worse. I ran all the simulations, and none of them point to an active system. Because you're using the existing models. But Ethan said if you updated them to take global warming into account, then you could... Are you hearing this? Global warming? I already told you. It's part of a natural cycle. Logan's right. I can't risk starting a panic based on a hunch. A hunch? Ethan's the only one that's been right all day. You asked me to run a crawl. I ran a crawl. Deb, it is two days until Christmas. Do you really want to risk people's safety because you wouldn't give them better warning? Addison, Logan is the chief meteorologist of the station. Exactly. And people trust us. Until the Emergency Weather Service says otherwise, I won't authorize anything more than a watch. Then at least let me break in. Break in? In the middle of Viewpoint? It's our highest-rated morning show. Then we can roll it during a break, but you have to let me warn people. Fine. Thank you. Someone get me Terry. What was that all about? She won't let me break in. She doesn't want to start a panic based on a hunch. We've had three twisters already today. How many more does she need before she'll take it seriously? You know this is the way she is. Always doing everything by the books. Besides, it's not like you're gonna be here much longer anyway. What are you talking about? Come on. It's the worst-kept secret in the station. Everybody knows that Logan's trying to take you guys out of here. I think it's amazing. You deserve a big break. You know what? Logan is trying to take himself out of here. Hmm. I have my family to think about. You know, Granbury's our home now. Ethan's got his job at the university. The kids, they've got school, they've got their friends. I'm afraid that I'm not there for them enough as it is, you know? They are so lucky to have you as their mom. Thanks. You're welcome. What are you doing here anyway? You should be at home taking care of this action! Doctor says that I can work a week up until my due date. It doesn't mean it's a good idea. But I feel fine, so it's okay. At least promise me that you'll stay off your feet. Addison... Hey. Five-minute warning. Thanks, George. Break a leg. Okay, get back to work. Hmm... Hey, stubborn girl. I wasn't kidding. Stay off of those. Okay, I will. I promise. Thank you. Thank you. Dad, why are you here? What's going on? There's a storm coming, and I want you to be safe. But the guy on TV said that there wasn't gonna... The guy on TV's an idiot. Right? Has your dad ever been wrong about a storm? Okay, but the guy on TV is still an idiot. What about everyone else? I talked to the principal. Everybody's gonna be safe, all right? It's, uh... Be strong. Buck up, man. Come on. Let's go get your sister and take her to your grandmother's house. Um, Dad? Don't worry about it. Get in the car. We'll talk. Get in. But... [principal over PA] Attention, students. We are going to conduct a tornado drill. Attention, students. We are going to conduct a tornado drill. Is that bad? It's getting closer. What's that? Emergency Weather Service. All right, three minutes to air time, people! The Emergency Weather Service just issued a warning. Oh, no. Does Logan believes me now? [sighs] Where are you and the kids? I just picked up Max. We're on our way to the high school. Dad? Give me a minute. I'm on the phone with your mother. Dad! We'll be there in about five minutes. Dad! What? Kaitlyn's not at school. What did he just say? What do you mean she's not at school? I don't know, but she told me not to tell. You hear that? He doesn't know. Do you have any idea where she could be? She's a 17-year-old girl, and it's two days to Christmas. Where do you think she might be? The mall. If I leave now, I can get there in 40 minutes. Why don't I meet you there. I love you, Addison, and I want you safe. You're better off in that reinforced building than anywhere in town. Besides, the city needs you there, on TV, telling them how to stay safe. I'll get the kids. Fine. But just... Call me as soon as you find her, okay? I will. I love you. I love you, too. I told you, nobody's going on a date with Bryan. You're totally going on a date with Bryan. Shut up. Wait. What about these ones? Mm. How much? It's like 150. [chuckles] Yeah, right. My dad would kill me. [phone ringing] Maybe that's Bryan. Lexi... Kaitlyn Walker's phone. Lexi. Hi, Mr. Walker. Put my daughter on the phone, please. It's your dad. Great. Hey, Dad. Kaitlyn, thank goodness. Where are you? Um, at school. Max already told me you're not at school. Where are you? Are you at the mall? What's wrong? Little punk ratted me out. He's not a punk. We'll talk about this later. I'm on my way. On your way? What... Why? What's going on? Dad? Hello? Can you hear me?

It's northeast. The mall, Dad. Thanks, Chloe. Over. Hold on. [screaming, shouting] It's Bryan! Kaitlyn! Quick! Somebody, open the door! Come on! Come on, please! He's pounding on the door! Please! Watch out! [grunting] [screaming] No! No! [screaming] There's nothing we can do. Come on! [glass breaking] My daughter. Ma'am. Have you seen my... No, wait. Stop! My daughter! My daughter! [wind whistling] [crashing] Got about 30 people in ER over at Lake Granbury Medical Center. The police department switchboards are down. They're re-routing phone calls to Weatherford and Benbrook. They're setting up an emergency shelter over at Robertson Elementary. If you'd let me give that warning when I wanted to, this could've been avoided. What do you want? An apology? I made a decision that I believed was right for this station. People died, Deb. They could've had 20, maybe even 30 minutes to prepare for this. And if your husband was wrong, we would have created a panic for no reason. My family was out there! Yes, and with any luck, your husband was able to get to your daughter in time. Okay, we're ready. Where you going? I may have made a mistake, but I have a job to do. Deb, tell me you're not serious about this. I'm the producer, and it's my decision. He's going out, you're going on. And I suggest you freshen up. You look exhausted. You are so much better than this, Addy. You should take the offer. You know what? I have been doing a lot of thinking about it. That's more like it. Tell them I'm not interested. What? You heard me. Tell New York I'm not interested. I'm staying here in Texas with my family at Channel 7. Because apparently they need someone here who actually gives a damn. So... we are going, right? We're too late, aren't we, Dad? [radio newscaster] Much of downtown Granbury has been severely damaged by the tornado, including Granbury Middle School. Dad! Luckily, the students had been in the basement shelter at the time, and no fatalities or serious injuries have been reported. You saved them, Dad. Let's go get your sister now. [Kaitlyn] I can't believe Bryan's gone. Do you think it's over? I'm gonna go check. Okay. Hello? Is anybody in here? [girl] Help! Hello? Hello? Help. Help. It's okay. Now, come on. Come to me. Don't worry. I'm gonna help you. What's your name? Anna. Okay, Anna. I need you to take my hand. My leg hurts. Okay. We can get that checked out, but I just need you to come with me, okay? Okay. It's all right. Okay. That way it won't get infected, okay? Okay, Anna, I need you to be brave. Can you be brave for me? Come on. Terry? Yeah. Has anyone heard from my husband? Not that I know of, but the phones and cell towers are down all over Hood County. They're trying to restore service now. Okay. Hey, listen, Addy. I'm sure he'll be fine. I appreciate it. I really do. Thanks. Yeah. Oh, but if you could find me a CB radio, that would be so great. There may be one in storage in the basement. I'll have Joanna check it out. Thank you. All right. That's Kaitlyn's car. Stay in the car. But, Dad... I mean it. Stay in the car. Are we clear? Yeah. Be right back. Mom... Anna! Anna! Oh, I... Anna! Thank you. Thank you so much. Baby, come on. Kaitlyn! Have you seen my daughter? Have you seen my daughter? Have you seen my daughter? No. She's... Kaitlyn! Kaitlyn! Dad? Oh! I'm so glad you're okay. I'm so sorry, Dad. It was my idea. Oh, come here. Come here. I'm so glad you're safe. Is Max okay? He's in the car. Let's go. Come on. Okay. [laughs] Sure you're okay? Yeah. Max? Max? I told him to wait right here. He's got to be around here somewhere. Max! Max? Max! Have you seen a boy? Twelve? Red hair? No. Have you seen my son? He's 12 years old. He's got red hair, wearing a Texas shirt. I haven't seen anyone like that, man. Sorry. Have you seen... Anybody. A boy, 12 years old? I didn't see him. Didn't see him. Red hair? Check back there. Excuse me, my son, he's wearing a Texas shirt. Have you seen my son? Have you seen my son? He's 12. He's got red hair. Have you seen my son? No, I'm sorry. He's got red hair. He's only 12. He's this big. Sorry. He's got a sweater on. Have you seen my son? Have you seen a little boy? He's about 12. Freckles, red hair. He was wearing a sweater just like this. He said he'd help me find my grandfather. He wanted me to stay warm. That's fine. Did you see where he went? That way. All right. Wait, here. No, no. No, no. Take this. It's okay. Keep it. Stay warm, all right? Help. Can you help her out? I think she's in shock. Are you okay? Max! Max! It's Dad. Can you hear me? Max! Max! Max! Over here! Over here! He was helping me out, and the ceiling just crashed down on him. Max, are you in there? Max. Max! Oh, my God, no. No. No, no! Max! Max. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Are you okay? Can you move? Is the girl's grandpa okay? [grunts] I'm just fine, thanks to you, kiddo. Can you move, Max? I'll pull you up. Come on. Okay. I'm sorry I didn't stay in the car. No, we're gonna talk about that later, okay? Can you stand up? I don't know. I'm gonna pick him up. Okay. We better get outta here. Yeah. Don't you ever do that to me again! I'm so sorry, but Dad made me tell him about you skipping school. [laughs] That's not what I'm talking about. I mean you scaring the heck out of me. Never again. Okay? Okay. Now come here. Come on. Let's go get Mom. Oh, that can't be good. Chloe. It's Ethan. Come in. Over. Dr. Walker. How's it looking on the radar? Over. Not good. We've got a significant lift off the cold front and the temperature is decreasing rapidly with height. What's that mean, Dad? Means more tornadoes. Any movement? Over. Uh... Northeast. Towards the city. Mom. It's heading towards Lake Worth. The power plant. I'll call you back. Over. Over. I need you to take your brother to your grandmother's. She's got a storm shelter there. You'll all be safe. Okay? We have to go get Ashlee. I'll find Ashlee after I have your mother. Dad? I want to go with you. I need you to watch your brother. I can take Max, Mr. Walker. Please? You might need help. Let me come. Fine. But you have to do everything I say. I promise. You know how to get to Grandmother's house? Go straight there. Don't stop for anything. You got it. Come on, Max. Deb, hey, any luck finding that CB radio? I think Joanna's looking for one. Look, I know you're worried, but I'm sure your family is fine. Ethan had a good head start. I'm sure he got there before it hit. I shouldn't even be here. I should be out there with them. I know, but they closed every road out of this town. They're not letting anyone through except emergency personnel. Besides, this is the story of the decade, honey, and you're right in the middle of it. Who do you think the nationals are gonna turn to for the footage? Not to mention the ratings. Seriously, Deb, ratings? There are kids out there. Families like mine, and this thing is headed right for them. It's a business, Addison. What happened to journalistic integrity? I hear PBS is hiring. You're really unbelievable, you know that? Hey, they're ready for you. Thanks. Didn't you say you wanted to warn the people? So go back to your desk and tell the people of this town what's going on out there. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go make a phone call. Good luck with that. [thunder rumbling] Small funnels have been spotted in the vicinity of the Lake Worth Power Plant. Hey, you know, if it hits that plant, everything northeast of the 287 will lose power. That's our story. Cut over to the 199. All right, I'm on it. [alarm blaring] [Logan] Right here, right here. Here we go. Oh, what are you doing? We're going live. Are you crazy? You hear that siren? What I hear are commendations, Emmys. Maybe a network desk. If we can jump over to the 30, we can get out of its path. You're shooting this now, or you're gonna spend the rest of your career covering town meetings for public access. Now, come on, hurry up. Oh... This is stupid. [alarm blaring] Get your game face on. We're going up there. Can we discuss this? Can we talk about it? We got a twister! Location? It's right outside the power plant, and it's gonna head straight through. Speed? Uh... Zack! Hold your horses! Okay, I got it right here. It's 320. It's an F6. Um... Dr. Walker, come in. I'm on I-35. I'll be at the station in ten minutes. It's an F6, Dr. Walker. What? That's impossible. Is that bad, Dad? Very. The core is skirting the downtown district, but, Doc, I think this thing is gonna turn. I think you're right. Over. We don't have much time. Does it look like I've been outside for a while? Looks like I've been in the elements, huh? All right, we're kicking it to you live in 20 seconds. Ready on remote? Standing by. All right. You ready, Logan? Always. You know, if only I could bottle that man's ego, I could afford to quit this job. [laughing] Okay, we're in live in five, four, three, two... We're going now to our own Logan Haynes, reporting live from the field. This is Logan Haynes, reporting live from the Lake Worth Power Plant. As you can see behind me, we are witnessing something incredible. A freak Christmas twister It's turning. Is moving in on the city of Fort Worth. This power plant, responsible for providing power... Deb, you've got to get him out of there. Look at this footage! Currently stands in the path of one of the largest storms in the nation's history. Kill it. Now! At least for now, disaster has been avoided. Uh, Logan? Logan, this is Addy. You gotta get out of there! Say again? Get out of there now! [screams] [gasps] Cut to commercial. Do it! Deb? George. Did you see what happened to Logan? I did. Have you seen Deb? Yeah. She just came through. She went that way. Okay. Deb! [sobbing] Hey. It's not your fault. I sent him out there. You didn't know. You did. Ethan did. I should've listened. Look, he went up on that roof all by himself. That was his call, not yours. I know he could be obnoxious and a little conceited at times, and I knew he was looking to transfer out of here, but he was still part of the family. I know. And now... now he's gone. You don't think there's some way that maybe he could have survived? No, I don't think so. What are we gonna do? Tell me, Addy, what am I supposed to do? You know what? We're gonna have time to mourn him later, I promise you. I promise. But we have a tornado coming our way and a building full of people that we need to get to safety. You're right. It's comin', isn't it? Yeah. But we're not gonna lose anyone else today, okay? I promise. Okay. Come on. We got a station to save. Okay. We've got funnels reported at River Oak, River Bend, and University Park! The Lake Worth Power Plant is offline. Emergency triage centers are being set up at Covenant and St. Mary's. Can I have your attention? Everyone, please! There's a severe tornado headed our way. I need everyone to get to the shelter now! Everybody, move quickly and carefully! Don't stop until you've reached the shelter. Keep going. Hey, Deb, where's Joanna? Um, Joanna? Where is she? She went to go look for a radio for you in storage. Oh, no. [tapping keyboard] We've lost the transmitter. Transmission antennas are down. All right, people, let's get down to the shelter. Now, people, now! Come on. Move it. Move it! Let's go, let's go! [Joanna] Somebody, help me, please. Joanna? Joanna? Are you down here? [Joanna] Somebody, help! Help! Joanna! Hang on, Jo, I'm coming! Joanna? Joanna, are you down here? Joanna? [coughing] Joanna, are you down here? Joanna! Joanna, are you down here? I'm in here. Joanna! I'm in here. Joanna, are you okay? Help me. My legs are stuck. [Joanna] Are the others okay? Yeah, they got to the shelter. Look, you gotta hold on, okay? I'm gonna lift this off of you. [groans] Okay? [grunting] Oh... Oh! Can you move? Can you slide out? Okay. [grunting] Can you stand up? I can try. Okay. Let's do it on three, okay? One, two... three. [groaning] Okay, let's get you out of here. Okay. Come on. [whimpering] Addison. [coughing] Can you make it? Only way is to try. Just one step at a time. [coughing] I can't breathe. Come on. You can do it. I can't breathe. [coughing] Okay, we'll find another way. Come on. [gasping] [coughing] I need air, or I'm gonna pass out! [coughing] [Ethan] Addison! Ethan! Where's Addison? She went to go look for Joanna like 20 minutes ago. Where? Uh, the sub closet. The sub-basement. [coughing] Come on. [alarm blaring] Addison! Mom? Dad! [coughing] [groaning, wheezing] No! Oh! [groaning] Come on. We're gonna find another way. Come on. No, no, I can't. I can't go anywhere. [whimpering] Okay. Just sit down. [grunting, coughing] It's okay. They're gonna find us. Somebody's gonna find us. Addison! Mom? Addison! Mom? [coughing] Addison! Addison! Mom? Addison, can you hear me? Ethan... Mom? I'm here. I hear you, Addison! Where are you? I'm here! Addison! Mom! Joanna, Ethan's here. It's gonna be okay. Joanna? Joanna. Joanna! Joanna, wake up! Jo... She's not responding! Are you okay? Yeah. Oh, God. She's not breathing. Breathe. Please. Come on. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... [coughing] Oh, oxygen. It's okay. No, you're okay, okay. Where's Max? He's at your mother's. I love you. I love you. Can you get up? I'm gonna get you up. You're okay, you're okay. Get you up. That's good. Oxygen, oxygen. That's right. [gasping] Oh, my God. I'm so glad you're okay. Ethan, I'm so sorry about before. I should have listened to you. It's okay, all right? It's our anniversary, and I wanna go home. Well, why don't we grill up a couple of steaks, pick up a bottle of wine? You remembered. Yeah. Yeah. Are you there? Over. Dr. Walker? It's me. We have Addison. We're okay. We're all okay. How is the radar looking? Over. It's beautiful, Doc. The hook echo's gone, and the system's clearing up. It's finally over. Then I think it's time we all finally take a long winter break. What do you think? Over. Heck yeah, Doc. [laughing] Over and out. Over... Over and out. That went well. Yeah. Put 'er there, partner! You know nothing ever happened between Logan and me. I do. He wanted us to take a transfer to New York, but I told him no. 'Cause Texas is our home now. I love you. I love you, too. Whoo! I hope Ashlee's okay. She's a smart dog. She'll be fine. I can't believe your Nativity set is still there. You're right. It's pretty cool. You did a good job. Does that mean I'm not grounded anymore? Grounded? I don't remember grounding you. I don't remember that happening. Who's hungry? I am. I'm first. Yes. Stop it! Oh, no. Ow. Gross. [barking] Ashlee? Come here, Ashlee! Oh, my God, Ashlee's back! [all laughing] Hi, girl. Hi. Ashlee.
