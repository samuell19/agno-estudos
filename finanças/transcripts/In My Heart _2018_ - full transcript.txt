Everyone has some untold stories and childhood traumas deep within them. My childhood trauma was caused by my brother. What are you looking at? You should wash your hair before you trim it. This is a full package for you. - Drop dead! - You too. - You three. - You four. Do you still want to trim it? Yes! But it has to be stylish. Stylish, is it? No problem. Done. And look! - You... - Didn't you say stylish? It looks stylish! No! It's not! - No! - Come here! Don't be upset! It looks great. It really does! It's not! I've made you stylish. I did! Come on, it looks great. Ah Yuan, wait! My dear brother, I have an idea to make you a real stylish man. My dear brother, do we really have to do this? It's said that all indigenous men have to go through this in order to be real men. Besides, Ah Hui said that it will look bigger after trimming. - Bigger? - Yes. This is much better. Sorry. Bigger! Bigger! Real man! Real man! I'm confused about what the two boys are thinking. So do you understand men? All three of you are making me go crazy. You alone make me go mad. Why do you want me then? Because I am insane. Laughing at his cute stubbornness Just like a kid The shadow is speaking with the moonlight If I have a million A million I have a million I should have not worried People will not know without saying Apply some cream later, it will get itchy. Good night. Mission completed. Let's go. Are we leaving? What if Dad comes later? The piano will be sent away tomorrow. I bet you're afraid. No, I'm not. Let's do it! Let's do it! Let's go! You think you're smart? You think I can't see you? This is my place, you can't come and go as you wish. Get out of here. If I ever see you again... If I'm rich in the future, I'll buy one and put it in the washroom. But why in the washroom? Don't you think if there's a piano in the washroom, you can poop smoothly? Then you got to have a big washroom. Didn't I say that when I'm rich? You're such a fool. Then your piano will stink. Your poop is smelly. Yours is even more smelly. Though my poop is smelly, I could probably change a piano each day since I'm rich. Happy New Year! Ah Le! Are you all right? Ah Le! Can you get up? Ah Yuan! Which hand? No! Ah Le! Recognize my face. Two years later Two years later Mom Are you still thinking about the incident that night? Since you're in university, why don't you enjoy your life now? Stop thinking too much. Being a freshman is fascinating! There are lots of pretty girls! Look! Aren't you a freshman too? That's different. I'll show them who is the hottest guy on the orientation day. Ah Le, will you be there on that day? I got work. Why are you working on the first day of school? I have to earn my tuition fee. They said that most of the pretty girls are from the Faculty of Music. My goal is to change a girlfriend each semester. Is one too little? Hey. You should get a girlfriend soon. You old virgin. It's beautiful! The sound insulation is good. Cooking is prohibited in the dorm. Who are you? I... I guess I'm your roommate. Nice to meet you. Are you attending the orientation day? No. It'll be a waste if you don't. Don't you know that our Faculty of Music is famous for pretty girls? Do you know what is my goal? Will it be changing girlfriends each semester? You're like my soulmate! Dude, if only there is one fish ball left in the pot today, I would be glad to share it with you. Do you want some? No. For you. Thank you. Don't you want to eat? If there's nothing else, I'll get some rest. I have work later. All right. Get some sleep. I shall take a nap too and put on my facial mask. On the orientation day, Mr. Car will be the most handsome among all. Move aside. Do you have shampoo with you? I forgot mine. Your bed is harder than mine. Thank you for coming. Thank you for coming. Gradually, you'll need to learn to take care of yourself. Sorry. Professor? My apologies, sir! I'm late! Morning, class. - Morning. - Morning. My name is Mr. Car. C. A. R. Car! Okay? No laughing! Serious! In order to be great and disciplined students of the Faculty of Music, the first thing you have to learn is to be punctual! Because lost time will never be found again! The cute student who bumped into me just now, can you tell me why you chose this faculty? Because I want to be like Jam Hsiao. He can sing and earn money. You're shallow! Is music a tool for you to earn money? Plus, Jam Hsiao is a guy! Please have a seat. What shampoo do you use? You have split ends. Give me your phone number and stay back after class. I shall moisturize it for you. I am really amazing. Applause, everyone! Thank you. Your speech is great, sir! How should I address you? Mr. Car. Mr. Car. What about you? I'm a professor too. Nice to meet you, sir. Sir, I've greeted everyone for you. I've found that all of us are passionate and ambitious. Sir, don't worry. We will be your best class. - Keep it up. - Thank you for your hard work. Does your mom know that you're cute? Get lost. Thank you for your hard work. No worries. Ladies and gentlemen. Hello. Let me introduce myself. My last name is Ann, so you can call me Mr. Ann. This is a theatre. A good platform is what a musician need. Music tells a story. Have you ever listened to a song and felt depressed? When the emotion struck, your tears automatically fall? We all have. We have all made some mistakes. We have all lost someone. We have all tried to hide ourselves. We thought that as long as we hide ourselves, as long as we suffer, it means we've made up for it. But when we hear a song that hurts us, we suddenly realize that we are not alone. What are you doing? Is there anything that could sober me up? Milk. 8.50 ringgit. Milk? This library is haunted. The milk is tasty. I'd like a box of it. Milk? To sober me up? I've sent it. Let's party! Ah Le, I knew you would come. This is a place full of youth. My pretty juniors! We are coming! Mic test. Make some noise! To all juniors, it's great to meet you. Tonight, we will have the ritual activity of our Faculty of Music. There is a spotlight that will keep turning around. The person where the light shines on shall step forward, pick up an instrument, and do an impromptu show! You need to continue this music piece! Are you ready? DJ! Drop the beat! This is called music! Aren't I so talented? Not bad. But the violin started with the root position and changed to first inversion during the second verse. I find it's rather easy. If he adds a little diminished and dominant percussion, it would be better. Here you go. Collect the money from the girl. I've got to go. Hey. My friend who just left, the one with the red top. He told me that you did play your violin well, but you changed from root position to first inversion. If you add a little dominant or diminished percussion, it would be better. I've given you the advice. It's up to you to take it or not. Collect the money from the girl and pass it to me later. Bye. Hi. It's me again, Mr. Car. C. A. R. Car. Did you enjoy my performance on the orientation day? Of course you do. I'm charming, especially my hair. Just like the Korean oppa. It's tender. There's only one viewer. Perhaps they haven't connected. There's no one left. Why are you recording this? It's meaningless. Why do you say so? I've got lots of fans. There aren't any comments. I won't leave my friend alone. It's all right. I'll protect you. What's your name? Nice to meet you! I'm Monster. What's your name? I'm Ah Le. My name is... You're so annoying. Monster. Sounds weird. It's good to be weird. Why live a usual life? Good morning, class. - Good morning. - Good morning. I've prepared the most important assignment of this semester for you today. It's a music competition. Class monitor, distribute them. Make a group of three. This marks 40 percent of this semester. Look for team members and register with me. You are on my team. So am I. All right. I'll register now. I don't plan to participate. I'd be fine if I get 60 percent in the exams. Dude, my fate is all on you. Bye. Alternative Music We will meet at 11 a.m. tomorrow in the rehearsal hall. Don't be late. Dude, I'm forced to give out your phone number. You'll understand. Phones are not allowed during work. Excuse me. You're not allowed to play cards in the library. Let's continue. Sorry, I have to keep them. No playing cards! None of your business! I just want to play cards! Run! What's wrong with you? You want to continue? Don't you see they are stronger than you? Why won't you run away? Are you worried about me? Running away won't solve the problem. Punch them! Hey! Hey! What's wrong? My dearest brother, shouldn't you bail me out? Why are you here too? We are brothers. We stick together through thick and thin. But this is my first time here. Cool! Just like on TV. Ah Le, look. Let me out, I'm innocent! I don't want to pick up the soap. Is it similar? Wait a moment. I heard that a girl rescued you. Shouldn't you marry her then as repayment? Like this? You're such a retard. She could be the most important person in your life. Let's not wait any longer. You've got to marry her. Let's practice for a bit. Come. No! Get off! I'll teach you. Let's practice for a bit. - No way! - Come. When can we leave? I have a date with my mom. From my experience, I don't know. I told you not to fight. Now, look. Say it again? I told you not to fight. Now, look. You even lost to a girl. My first time in the police station, cool! Are you bailing me out? Yes, that's why you're here. Your friend is amazing. Thank him for me. I have to go now. No time to waste. Inspiration hit me suddenly. The policemen. Brat, did you hit my daughter? You? You're involved too? What are you recording? Never seen a person as handsome as me? - You... - Dad, you look handsome. Watch out. What time is it? Get out of your bed! What actually do you want? I'm not participating! Don't bother me! No way! You're so selfish! Have you ever thought about us? About those who have only one chance to pursue their dream? Have you ever thought about not everyone having the chance to pursue their dream? What's wrong? Your nose... Nothing! The coffee can't wash away my loneliness It just scorches the heart I'm hiding in the car Grabbing a glass of champagne Wishing to give you a birthday surprise I should have let go But the wind isn't bringing me along I'm afraid I'll fall for you I shouldn't get too close It's the end of the story But it may not be the end Don't bring it away There were three words Who? -I tell you every day -Is it you? -Though it doesn't spark anymore -But will the love remain -But it's meaningful -But will the love remain - Who is there? - Who is there? Basking in the sun on a breezy day at the beach Breathe under the warm sunlight I'm flying up! The warm sea allows us to soar bravely -The dream accompanied -The dream accompanied -By the rainbow -By the rainbow -They're as insane as us -They're as insane as us -I look left -I look right -I look up -I look down -It's not easy -It's not easy -To pick a song -To pick a song I'm confused. How could I sing so well? There are so many good songs. Which song shall we choose for the competition? It's six o'clock. Time's up. I'm leaving. Right, you need to work. Thanks to someone, I'm fired. I have to look for a new job. Follow me. Where are we going? I don't owe anyone. Could you check on... this amplifier for me? It's inverted. Annoying? What do you mean "annoying"? You came to my daughter, I should be annoyed. You're calling me annoying? What I mean is "amplifier." I suppose it was inverted when the factory did the installation. Most people can't hear it, but I can. Come. Put this on. Okay, start working. I'll pay you double with an additional allowance, okay? Thank you for coming. SORRY, WE'RE CLOSED Sorry, we are closed. Come in. It's free, that doesn't matter If I had one million One million Dear friend, it's one million. You're thinking too much. Thank you. Please take a seat. Next, I'd like to tell my best friend, my dearest brother Xie Ji Ling, about my thoughts... You've left us for many years. But you never left my heart. I know every show must come to an end. But there is a song that remains unwritten and unsung. "Your song." When I think of you I sing this song I'm delighted I won't be lonely forever The moment we've been together Stays in my heart for years Though you're gone Vaguely I hear Your voice When I think of you I call out your name I miss you And surely you know it Walking on the road that we fought for My dad was a singer. Why is he running a musical instrument shop? Do you think it's easy to earn a living by singing? He used to sell CDs. But now, we can get everything online. Who's willing to spend money on a CD? Why did you choose music then? Music can't earn you a living. Earning money and pursuing my dream are two different things. Feel fearless on a stormy night Your song Will be endless Do you need help? No, thank you. I'll open the door then. Be careful. I finally understand how you could beat down those three men. Brat, are you dating my daughter? Keep dreaming. Aren't you afraid that I can't get married? It doesn't matter. Come home, I'll take care of you. My daughter. Let me tell you. There is no man in the world that will love you like I do. I love you. Really! You scared me. I'll be going then. Since you're so talented, why don't you take part in the competition? I heard you sing. I know everyone has their own secrets. But if you really like it, just cherish the opportunity. We don't have much time. Don't regret it only after losing it. Have you done anything that you regretted? Like my dad said, "The meaning of life is not determined by its duration, but its dedication." What are you doing? What can I do? I'm making a fool of you. How's your new job? How did you know I got a new job? Come on, I'm your brother. I heard that the girl broke into the male dorm because of you. Everyone in the school knows it. That's exaggerating. It's only you. Will there be a problem if it is? What is it? Anything? Only you know it! Are you crazy? Your hands are dirty! It's late. Why are you here? I just came back from the hospital. To check on my hands. You're destined to owe me for a lifetime. For you. Take it. I don't want your hand, it's ugly. Does yours look good? My hands are talented at playing the piano. It's way different from yours, my brother. This isn't bad though. Perhaps I'm not suitable for the Faculty of Music. Right? Why do you say so? You're different. Why am I different? Besides music, you know nothing. You're bad with your English, Math, Geography... What else? It's painful! It's really painful! Thank you very much. Stop that. Chen Zhi Le. There's something I can never do in my life despite how hard I work on it. It can't be done in my life. Hence, you should do it. Have my support and pursue it. Keep going! Did you hear me? I get it, you don't need to yell! I'm advising you! Don't grumble. All right, I'll keep going. Promise? Promise. Keep going. Singing and composing are the criteria In order to survive, you need to have some skills Pick yourself up when you fall Humble is the key to success Many might not know How much effort you have put in Bitter sadness doesn't matter As long as your story is unforgettable by many Others might put you down But keep on going One day, I'll be the shining star - Cheers! - Cheers! If we keep it up, every girl in the school would be my fan. They'll feed me with good food, chasing after me. It's really troublesome to be talented. You're exaggerating. We just got into the semifinal. No! I'm wondering if they like me being fit or chubby? All right, I shall do a live to ask everyone. Actually, I regret letting you in our group. Hey, girl. Don't be... To mark our success, I'll bring my family treasure given by my grandpa to my dad, and him to me, the low sugar, high calcium, colorful milky ice cream for everyone. What do you guys think? It would be my pleasure. I'll get it from the dorm. Bye. Hey. What are you listening to? This is the love song my dad composed for my mom. Here you go. What a nice song. But why is there only music with no lyrics? Before my dad could finish, my mom... She passed away. Due to cancer. It's genetic. What? Can you fill in the lyrics? No, I can't. Yes, you can. Just pretend that it's for someone you like. A book represents a story that reminds me of someone. If I die before writing a book, will you remember me? Alternative Music, Semifinals Mom Hello? Let's give a round of applause for the next group. Ah Le? Ah Le? Everybody listen to my tempo You can repeat and roll and roll Roll and roll They say musicians like to suffer Don't understand why people are weeping in your world The bullying language It's in fact your mom and dad's Stretch of an old wound You shall give in to no one Because you're alone in the end The long path, the path that never leads home Though it's lonely I'm holding on Hardly I'm saying I miss you like Malaysia's weather I'm saying I love you like Malaysia's weather I'm saying I miss you like Malaysia's weather I'm saying I love you like Malaysia's weather Three, two, one, clear. -I've got that loving feeling -I've got that loving feeling -That loving feeling -That loving feeling -Look at that girl -Look at that girl -In the distance -In the distance -I've got that loving feeling -I've got that loving feeling -I've got that loving feeling -I've got that loving feeling -That loving feeling -That loving feeling -Look at that girl -Look at that girl -In the distance -In the distance -I've got that loving feeling -I've got that loving feeling -That loving feeling -That loving feeling Who called you earlier? It's my mom. She had told me that my brother is critical. But I just got a message saying that he's out of the woods. Aren't you visiting him? No. I don't think my dad wants to see me. Why are you smoking? Ah Le! Ah Yuan! My hands are talented at playing the piano. Thank you very much. Stop that. Come on, I'm your brother. You're destined to owe me for a lifetime. Standing on the stage today, I felt like I lost a family member. I felt like I lost my brother. It's all my fault. If it's not because of me, he wouldn't be in the hospital. Should I go with you tomorrow? Mom. Thank you. Come here, take a seat. Be careful, it's hot. Ma'am, would you like to go home? We will take care of him. I can't sleep even if I'm home. In fact, I feel rather calm to be here. His dad will be here after work. I'll just rest here. Is there anything I can help with? There isn't much actually. I'm just keeping myself busy so that I wouldn't think too much. Fighting alone is tiring. Don't worry, we're here. Christmas is approaching. It's my third Christmas here. Are you Ah Le's girlfriend? No. Do you like him? A little. That boy is troublesome. I can't stop him from doing what he wants. And of course, he can't give me what I want either. Please take care of him for me. I'll try my best. Does he talk to you? Yes, a bit. He doesn't speak to me though. He wouldn't pick up whenever I called him. Even if he did, it's just... If I do that with my dad, I'm dead. He wasn't like this back then. The two of them would turn our home into a playground. They'd chase one another. They would share everything every day. They talked every day. When they were happy, they would jump and sing around. When they were upset, they would fight. They often did foolish things. Even the grandma who lived opposite us asked, "Are there problems with your two children?" Then I'd answer "no" each time and told her, "They were adopted. I'm not their biological mom." And there comes the problem now. One doesn't want to talk, and one is lying down, unable to talk. Thank you for bringing him back. No worries. I really want to bring them back home. Without them, the house feels so empty and huge. Hey, handsome. Could you give me a hand? My friend's son is bedridden. We would like to borrow your piano to play a song. Is that all right? Just for a while. Please. My son, your brother is playing you a song. Listen. Why are we doing this? I feel like he would like to listen to your music. Why are you smiling? Why can't I? I like to see you smile. I like you. Do you know how hard it is for me to see you? I keep telling myself to stay calm. If not, you will realize it. But once you smile, I'll melt. Can you not smile at me? Otherwise, I'm afraid that I can't leave you. I'm done with the lyrics. Do you want to listen to it? Where are you? You just disappeared. I'll wait for you outside of your house. Where have you been? I've completed the lyrics you asked for. I recorded it on the CD. What do you think? I'll take you to a place tomorrow. "Missing You" "Missing You" Dear, where were you today? Why didn't you pick up my calls? I heard from Qing that you went to the hospital on your own. Why didn't you tell me? Why are you listening to the music so loud? Can't you hear? Are you deaf? Dad. I can't hear. I can't hear anything. Ah Le completed the lyrics for me. But I can't hear anything. What should I do, Dad? That's why you left in silent Have you listened to the song? I can't hear anything temporarily. Let's just type here. You must have been using earplugs too frequently. Where are you bringing me to? Monster. It's been a long time. How are you? I can't hear. It's all right, you'll be fine. Is he your boyfriend? Hello. I'm a volunteer here. Everyone calls me Qing. Nice to meet you. I'm Ah Le. Nice to meet you. Let's go in. Don't run. Be careful. I have to work. See you in a bit. Thank you. I don't look good. You're beautiful. Is he your boyfriend? You're thinking too much. He is Ah Le. If I had the same hairstyle as hers, I'd be pretty too. Sorry. Why are you apologizing? Don't fall for me. Because I can't fall for you. What are you talking about? I was diagnosed with brain cancer. In fact, I should've moved into the rehabilitation center last year. Perhaps meeting you is the last gift that God gave me. Perhaps I'm too greedy. That's why the gift is being taken back from me. The tumor suppressed the nerves in my brain. And I'm deaf. So, I shall let you go. Don't worry. I know I've got more than I deserve. Thank you for being by my side. I shall walk the rest of my days alone. Can I walk with you? No. Please leave at the next stop. I'll go home by myself. Let me send you home. No. I don't want you to see me leave. Didn't you ask me not to give up on anything? Why are you giving up? I'm worried that I will miss you. And I don't want you to be upset. Am I not upset now? Can I be rebellious for one last time? I will miss you forever. Missing you. "Missing You" The dream that is not fulfilled is like writing a letter It disappears after posting it What kind of confidence Shattered my determination It withers without blooming You got so used to my tantrums You gave in to my pride Xie Chu Yu Perhaps you're making me independent That's why you left in silent Missing you You asked me not to give up but why are you giving up? Missing you The memory that cannot be filled I cried for love No matter where you are I'm missing you No matter where you are I love you Hey. Are you quitting? Why? I'm not competing anymore. Maybe I'm afraid. What are you afraid of? Because of music, I lost a lot of things. They eventually left me. I can only watch them leave. There's nothing I can do. Facing all these things that have no result, it has become meaningless. In the end, the one who gets abandoned is me. This was given by my mom. She slashed me and then jumped. I don't hate her. Music brought me back from despair. Things with no result, we should accomplish them and find the meaning behind it, right? The piano can't be played without patience. Without patience, you would press the wrong key though you know where the right one is. It's just like our life. Whoever you'd like to speak to, hand it to the music. Alternative Music, Finals It's rather emotional to be standing on the stage today. In my years within this field, my family always asks me, how's my life, and if I should change my job. The meaning of life is not determined by its duration, but its dedication. It's tough, but I think it's kind of romantic when you're chasing your dream. Tonight, let us feel the romance of the participants through music. Monster, though you can't be here, I know your spirit is with us. Let's complete the show now. With the courage you gave me, I write this song which I never thought I could. Everything that I want to tell you, I've written them in the lyrics. We're the characters in life That are highly coordinated I was selected, and you're selected We're competing with each other The black, the white, the grey, and the one that fits What's left are unspoken words The endless rules of life Is life being lived a little too seriously? I'm singing this love song with my life Swaying foolishly And choosing to love insanely As long as I'm alive I'll be courageous To witness my insane life You don't need to be talented to sing this love song Just bounce your head fiercely I don't have a style mentor I don't have a life mentor I'm left with my dreary soul That pretends to be strong Let's take a picture. Show me your cute face. Dear. You're leaving me so soon? I miss you. How could you leave me... Leave me... alone... to miss you. Dear, I miss you. I miss you. Dear. Seven days ago I miss you. When you're not qualified, there are words that can never be delivered.
