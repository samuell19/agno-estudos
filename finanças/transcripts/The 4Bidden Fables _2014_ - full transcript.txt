How do you tell someone that they've been living a lie? A lie that you've perpetrated, because of cowardice, because of love, and because of fear, fear of what the truth might inflict her mind. A mind that is not whole. We're here. You're late. I know, I know. Is he here? Please wait here whilst I fetch the doctor. May I take your coats? No, no thank you. We won't be staying long. Very well. Mother, will she be coming home with us this time? Yes, yes she will, Miranda. I haven't seen her in months, I miss her so much. I do too. I do too. There we go my friend. You're ready now. Wait till you see. One move. Bless you my little one. Bless you. That is your first. Good, good. What! Excuse me sir. What is it? It's your guests, they have arrived. Guests? Guests. Tell them, tell them I'll be down shortly. As for you, my sweet, we have a date later, so don't you move. Curious, are we? Your tea, sir. Would you like some tea? No, no thank you. You see, curiosity is what made me who I am today, but it is ingenuity that made me wealthy. That being said, did you bring it? Miranda? Would you go and get your sister ready? I'll be there in a moment. Is she still? Yes yes yes, the attic. There's something wrong with that child. There. That's the last of it. There will be no more. It feels a little... It's all there! Now give me what belongs to me. Give me back my daughter. Becca? It's me, are you awake? You came back. Oh yeah. Yes, I really didn't want to but mother made me. Of course I came back silly, you do remember what today is? It's our anniversary. How are you? I'm okay. I've been waiting for this day, it seems like forever. I know. I'm sorry. It just, mother, she's been working so hard, and... What's in the bag? Oh yes, close your eyes and no peeking. I've made you something. It's a surprise. Okay, you can look. What is it? Open it, go ahead and open it. It's a popup book! I love popup books. Is that me? Yes. I wish. What's that? That's the place I was telling you about. That's our place. Is that where we're going? Is that home? I brought you something else. Happy anniversary. It's a piano. Do you remember? I think so. Brava. Brava, brava. Encore. Go back, encore, encore. They make quite a team, your daughters. They are very talented. It would be a shame to split them up. Are you sure you want to do that? They are my main attraction. Yes, I can't take it anymore. And you're sure you can come up with the money? It's quite a process. And I have a lot invested. I'll have it. It may take a while, but I will have it. I will have it. It's not that I don't trust you, but I am a businessman. But you are a doctor? Right? A doctor, a lawyer, an entrepreneur, a man of the world. But I am trying to run a business here, and you're asking me to break up my main paying attraction. And for what? A mother's love of that. They are my daughters. Oh right. Fine, fine. But, I require a kind of collateral. Something substantial. Now excuse me, the show must go on. Thank you, thank you! Are they not amazing? The freak of unique Two for the price of one you'll find, for the price of admission. Miranda? I'm scared. Do you think it's gonna hurt? I don't want to do this. I don't want to leave you. I know Becca, me too. But this is what mother wants. She says it'll be best for both of us. Best for her? You always were her favorite. Becca, stop it. She loves both of us. She just wants us to be happy. I want us to be happy. I'll make you a promise. What's that? If we're not happy a year from now, I'll make things how they were. Promise. Now young ladies, it won't hurt a bit, not a bit. Don't struggle, don't struggle. Hello? Hey lady, hey, over here. I'm in here. In here, lady. Here, yeah. Can you help a bloke out? Can you give me that cup of water? Over there. That ain't gonna work. Can you pour it in my mouth? Please? Can you pour it in my mouth? My God, what happened to you? Did he do this to you? Do what? Make me famous? Make people like me? He's a genius, you know, the doctor. I was nothin', nobody, livin' in the gutters, begging for scraps. I ate a cat once. Now I'm a star. I'm the Human Worm. I'm one of a kind. Watch me bend. Watch me twist. Watch me squirm like a worm. I'm the freak, unique. I am the Human Worm. The Human Worm. I'm the Human Worm. The Human Worm! The Human Worm! Miranda? Are you awake? Are you ready? Are we really going to do this? I made a promise, a pact, and I can't live like this without you by my side. Is it going to hurt? I'm ready. I shouldn't be giving you anything, after what you did. You should be paying me. Now wait a minute. I told you there was no guarantees on a procedure of this magnitude. And besides, think of it, think of it as a storage fee. A storage fee? You have no idea what my daughter has been through this past year. That is not my fault. You should have talked to her. Stop! Enough! I know, I know, I planned on telling her tonight. I just, I just couldn't break her heart. Not after, not after what she's been through. What I put her through. Just give her back to me, so I can do the right thing. Fine fine, take her. She belongs to you. Our contract has been fulfilled. And the flowers and rainbows, and a waterfall that leads to the castle, and the trees and the grass is so green. It's so beautiful. Have you got... Oh my God. What have you done? Hello mother. I'm ready to go home now. What have you done? I told you to tell her. I knew something like this would happen. So do you remember? I'll show you. Though I could physically separate them, spiritually, I could not. Her mind, their mind, could not and would not accept this. For they were not sisters. There were one. They are one. They are my daughter. Becca? Becca, come on, it's over here. Wait for me, I'm coming. Jenny? Jenny! Hey, I'm talkin' to you. That durn kids anyway. Jenny! What took you girl? How am I supposed to listen to my music? What? What? Speak. But he doesn't like it. Well I don't give a damn if he like it or not. You wanna live like all them others? Poor, and livin' in the dark ages? Well do you girl? No sir. Look at me when I talk to you! Did your mama teach you no manners? Listen, I know he's your brother. He's my boy, and God forbid anything happen to him. That factory movin' in next door to us was the best thing that could have happened. We have all the modern luxuries. We are truly blessed. The Lord would want it this way. But he doesn't like it. You're killing him. Killing him? Killing him? I'm the one that's keeping him alive. If you don't feed him, he's gonna die. You want that on your conscience? Well do you girl? Of course we know it was your mother's fault. She's the one started drinking that shit. She called it the Lord's blood. Said it made her feel all alive inside. Of course that was before I killed her. And Billy, he was born all premature like that, and I knew, I knew it was a sign, a sign from the gods. What? What? You think I'm crazy too? You think I been drinkin' some of that Lord's blood? You want some? You want some? You want some of the Lord's blood? Now go feed Billy. What the hell's that? No, it's not yours. Ah, ain't that sweet? Now go. Git. Hey! Pay some respect to your mama. You're the perfect child. Oops, I'm sorry Billy. It's okay, it's just me. I brought something for you. It's a surprise. A surprise? Happy birthday, Billy. - I - know you're watching. I can smell you. I can smell, all of you. Y'all stink, y'all smell of the devil. I know things. I feel things, feel things. I feel you. I know you're in there. I know you can feel me. I know you can hear me. You're my baby. My child. Don't you worry, they won't hurt you. Quiet speaking, 'cause your mine. You're the perfect child, the Lord's child. And I know you're special, they'll see. They'll all see. My child is the chosen one. I'm sorry Billy. I know it's not your fault. It's them. It's him. He's selfish. He just wants what he wants, to use you. But I won't let that happen, not any more. I know you can hear me. I know you can feel me. I know you're in there Billy. I love you. What the hell you doin' girl? The hell you doin' girl? Stop. Stop! No. Are you crazy, girl? Crazy like your ma was? Stop! Get off of me. You just like Billy. You ain't my child. You ain't my blood. Your mama was a whore! Ahhh! Let go of me! Let go of me. Let go of me. You won't try to kill me. You ain't got the guts. Just as dumb as dumb Billy. Let me go. You, you freak. What the hell you doin' girl? He's not a freak. He's my brother. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday dear Billy ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪ If you make a wish, and blow out the candle, it'll come true. Billy. Yay! Surprise! I got you a present. Here, open it. Let me help you. Oh my, don't you look handsome. I'm gonna miss you. Hey, let's listen to some music. I love this song. Come on Billy, let's dance. Who are you? Why are you here? You tried to steal my food. You are stealing my food. You're a thief. You must be hungry. You poor little thing, I'll bet you haven't eaten in days, weeks even. Looks good, doesn't it? Do you want some? Of course you do. Go ahead, take a bite, you know you want to. Not so fast. What do you think, food grows on trees. Well, so what if it does? This isn't just any food, this is my food, and if you want some, you're gonna have to earn it. What shall it be? I know, you'll sing. You'll sing for me, and I'd better like it, or I'll squish you like a bug. Sing! Stop. That's enough. Where have you heard that song? That's my song. Go ahead, just take the food. I have plenty. I have all I ever want. All I ever need. Because I am queen. Because I am your queen. What now? Ah yes, kneel before your queen, peasant. What's wrong, can't breathe? Hey, I'm talking to you. Hey, hello? Are you dead? How dare you trick me? I own you. You're my pet. No, you are my slave, and you belong to me now, and you'll do my bidding. Or better yet, maybe I'll just eat you. What is that on your face? Are you wearing a mask? I wonder what you're hiding under there? Remove it. Remove it now, I want to see all of you. Or I'll take it off for you. Oh my, aren't you a pretty thing? What are you, besides ugly? Remove your rags. Remove everything. I want to see all of you. Hmm. So you want to be human do you? You want to be like me? You want to be beautiful. But you're not, you're a hideous little creature, and you can never be like me, because I am the queen, and you're nothing, nothing but a beggar, a thief. Well if you promise not to leave me, I'll remove you from your glass prison. But remember, you're mine now, and I can kill you with one finger. Do you promise? Oh no, not again. Not now. If I let you go, will you promise to come back? You know you have to come back? I mean I need you to come back. Please, please come back? Remember, you promised. Don't leave me here like this. Don't leave me here, alone. You see, we're not so different, after all. We can be friends. I need you. Sing for me. Come on, sing. Hey, I'm talking to you. Grandpa. The rain, it stopped? Yes, about an hour ago. Did you bring me pint? Yes, sir. Me beautiful lady, oh how I missed thee. Now what is it laddie, what are you all hot in the pants, about? Grandpa, I found it. You found what? The rainbow, the rainbow's end. What? The end, I found the rainbow's end. You found what? I told you to stay away from that bloody thing, it's evil. It's cursed! It's not a rainbow. It's only half of it. The rest is underground. It's a ring, a halo. It's the devil's halo. It lures the weak in with its beautiful colors. And the greedy, with its promise of gold. And anyone who looks for it, never returns. But I found the... Stop it! Stop it! You don't know what you're messin' with, lad. Nothing good can ever come from that rainbow, only pain only sufferin'. Sit down, laddie. I'm going to tell you somethin' I've never told anyone before. I was about your age, I too found the rainbow's end. I saw the pain, I saw the sufferin'. It was the last thing I ever saw. I can still see her face. I can still hear her screams. Stop, I mean it, stop! Are you all right? What are you, crazy? Serves you right, you bully. I'm bleedin', I'm bleedin'! Oh it's just a scratch, don't be such a baby. I'm bleedin'. Look at my dress. Mama's gonna kill me. Don't get all hot in the pants. It's just a dress. Come on, it's stopped raining. Grab my bag, we're gonna be late. Hey, I'm dying here. Never mind. Whoa. Look, a rainbow. It's so close. Come on. Let's go find the gold. Where you goin'? We're gonna be late. You can't reach the end of a rainbow. Hey, get out of there. I've got it. I've got the gold. No! And just like that, she was gone. Vanished into the vile pool of rotten flesh. But I had to do something. Find the strength, find the courage, I had to find my sister! But what I found, was hell. It was like a machine, a processing plant with millions of souls stuck to it, like flypaper. Their sins being ripped from their bones. Bit by bit. A cleansing, a purification Only to be fed to what lay beneath. The devil. Once cleansed, their skinless remains were discarded like rubbish. And their souls were set free, Free to complete their journey, their journey into the afterlife. Help me! Help me. Help me. Help me! Give me your hand. Give me your hand. Help, help! Let it go, give me your hand. Help me! Let it go. Give me your hand. Help me. No! If she only let it go. But Grandpa, I found it, I found the gold. You did what? Gold, gold? These are teeth. These are people's teeth. You brought this here? What the hell's wrong with ya boy? This belongs to the devil, and he's going to come looking for it. No one ever returns from... How did you escape? What? How did you get away with the gold? I never told you about that. How did you know? How did you escape? He didn't.
