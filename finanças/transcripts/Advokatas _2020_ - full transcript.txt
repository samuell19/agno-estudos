THE LAWYER Mrs Darya, I'm kindly asking for your understanding, we only work with corporate law. - Our family lawyer is on vacation. - Can't you help me?! - Don't you understand. - Do you speak in English?! What is going on? Oh, Marius, hello! - Hello, Mrs Darya... - Look at this! Darya Inanova's shocking outfit: nostalgia for the Soviet occupation? They want a scandal? OK, that's not a problem for me. I will sue them. But Mrs Darya, that's not what we do. But I told you, our family lawyer is on vacation. - Fuck, don't you understand? - Listen, listen... While it's true we normally work with corporate law, but... How we can refuse to help Madam Darya? Thank you, Marius. I am doing only what anyone would do in my situation. May I call you later to set up our meeting? Sure, sure. Whenever you want. Thank you so much! Marius, you're so kind. - Thank you. - You're an amazing person. Thank you so much. I appreciate you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Thank you darling. Have a good day. Bye! Next time, just call for me. I met him on Gedimino avenue the last time and he started talking about how he's planning to have his nose fixed. As if I would care. While he was talking about all this, I was thinking about something else the whole time. Not about his nose... It doesn't matter! And I was thinking, either he just loves to talk about himself or maybe he likes me. So I asked him if he was gay. Just like that? Of course he would. Bitch please! Your story is very interesting but you must end it in thirty seconds. Start the clock! I asked him if he was gay, and he replied, that, well probably not. But he could he intrigued to try... And this was my chance. Maybe he would want to try it with me? And so I asked. But he said "no". Be patient. Sometimes you find something, when you stop looking for it. Easy for you to talk, pretty boy. You just have to say "yes" and everybody falls under your feet. So I am one among many? You're the one he said "yes" to. Just don't be jealous! I am jealous. Don't be jealous, you're cute too. Very eloquent. Oh, I hate you so much, that I almost love you! Maybe we should go on a date sometime? But wait... You only like working class boys. Yes, I will never reach your high level. You scare Pranas away! He'll never want to see you guys again. "You guys"? Darling, you're one of us! He'll get used to this. Sorry Pranas, it's just our dark humor. All good, but I have one question. Go ahead. Why do you emphasize monogamous relationships so much? Exactly! In the gay scene we have so many apps, sites, sex, pornography, but... We are still missing something, we... Why can't we just accept and enjoy all these harmless things? Pranas has just started expressing his opinion, please, keep quiet. I do agree with Lukas. You see?! I'm not that stupid. After all, there can be all sorts of relationships. All sorts of meaningful ways to live your life. Aren't we too quick to embrace this idea of the heteronormative family? Well, it's one thing to understand these norms, as you call them, but... I like these traditional norms. I also want to have long, serious, real relationship. So that's why you fuck everybody who walks by. Do I sense jealousy again? Wait, wait, wait, wait... In my opinion, every relationship needs compromises. You need to learn how to concede, how to change yourself... And your habits. Dreams. So you're saying that we are together only because of some compromise? Here we go! I'm with you, because I love you... Nobody cares. But we are together, because we are learning how to adapt. Isn't that right, sweetheart? Yeah... I'm sure no one wants to hear any more of this flattery. Didn't scare you? Why should it? Sometimes I'm intimidated by them myself. Cheers! Cheers! Don't be afraid. How do you know Lukas? I'm volunteering at his organization. And you? Me too. But I never seen you. I sometimes help out. A bit. So what do you do? I study sculpture. Would you make a sculpture of me if I ordered one? Well... We don't necessarily see sculpture in a direct way. It could be a dance, a play or even a painting. That's very contemporary. Is that bad? I don't know... I'm a lawyer, not an art critic. You're defending yourself. No, why? I like contemporary art. I... I've been to a show recently. A very interesting exhibition... I can't recall the name. So whose show was it? I have no idea. Maybe we could visit an exhibition together sometime? You could explain everything to me. We could. Seriously, I don't get contemporary art. I think, artists are very privileged, they get public funding. I wonder, could they make a living without that? What type of lawyer are you? Corporate. OK, so your job is more important because you defend big companies? Hmm, I do a job that is necessary. To whom? What do you mean? To whom is it necessary? How does this help society? Very complicated questions from an artist. You really can't see how very privileged you are yourself? I'm an old poof in a homophobic Lithuania. Wait, didn't Lukas tell you about me? He said your are bisexual. Yes, and trans. Like, you want to become a woman? Like, I'm a trans man. How?! I'd better get going. I don't... I... That OK, I have to go anyway. Wait... Wait! So will you make that sculpture of me, if I place an order? You don't have enough money. Hey! Hey! - U want me go naked? - Oh... Is that how it works? Sorry, it's my first private show. I see u did 7 shows lol Ur credits will end Oh, don't worry about it. So? Ask me a question. R u from Russia? No, why did you say that?! Sorry. - Says u r from Vilnus - Yes, Vilnius is in Lithuania. Where are you from? - Syria Belgrade now - Oh, what are you doing there? I am refugee I can be who u want me to Policeman? Doctor? I'm not ill, thank you. Maybe you should be a dancer? What music do you like? Pop Go on! Džordža would be proud. Fuck! Sorry. Seems like we're out of luck here... LOL Let me call you sometime. Against the rules. I'll pay you. Just by credits... Come on! I just want to talk with you. I'll call you tomorrow. Thank you. Mom Hello, hi! Hello darling, how are you? I'm good! At work, busy as usual. And how are you? Did you sleep well? Oh, I need to recover from yesterday's gossip. Although, to be honest, I was very surprised, that you didn't say anything about Pranas. Why didn't you tell me he was trans? Oh gosh, haven't you seen the coming out video you funded? What?! Oh... You are a total idiot! So, what did he tell you? Nothing, he said nothing. I just thought that he had other expectations. Other expectations? Because... He's trans, and you like a more manly man, right? Where does this prejudice come from? Maybe I'm attracted to dicks, not to men! Attracted to dicks... Because you yourself are a bit of a dick, right? Don't get carried away! I'm calling not about that. So about what? You know, yesterday I met a Syrian refugee online. Wait... How so? - How? How? - You met him in Vilnius? No, he's in Belgrade. So how did you meet him? I'm telling you! I met him online. Listen to what I'm saying! Oh, it's because you can't go on a normal date, like a normal human being! What do you mean "a normal human being"? You've become some kind of conservative activist! Alright, don't piss me off! What's the big deal with meeting a Syrian migrant? Seriously, you're pissing me off. Hold on... I have to... I have to take another call. I'll call you back, OK? OK, bye! Mom Hello. Hello. How are you doing? I'm fine. How are you? Well... Not everything is fine. Why? What happened? I don't know how to tell you. Just say it. Dad died. Good morning. An espresso, please. OK. Condolences, Marius. Condolences. Marius... I'm sorry. You don't have to apologize. He apologize to you. He always felt sorry for the way things went. Don't say that. It's the truth. Stay strong. Take this. Hello baby! Hi, it's Marius from the chat yesterday. Oh, yes. The not Russian guy. Turns out there was a voyeur in our chat and he reported me for giving you my phone number. What? I'm sorry, I'll pay your fine. No... That voyeur already took care of it. I guess he only wanted me for himself. You know how that feels. That's not why I called you. Lost your job, as well? No, sorry. It's a mistake. Life is a mistake. Come on, I was kidding. Just tell me. My father died. The funeral is tomorrow. I'm sorry. My condolences, Martin. Marius. Thank you Ron. Ali! Thank you Ali. Are you a believer? No, are you? No. Not exactly... I believe it's important to be a good person, while you're alive. I believe that too. I wish I was better to him. Why? Did you do something wrong? I'm not sure. Did you ever lash out at him, steal from him or lie to him? No, I never did. Except for lying. I did lie to him, but it was telling the truth, that hurt him the most. So... How old are you? I'm fort... Thirty five. Thirty seven? Maybe... Certainly, you are an adult. True. Of course, be sad if you need to. It's normal. It's OK. I don't feel sad, I took pills. What do you feel? I feel like you should be here with me. Hello! Oh, hello Marius! I'm so happy you came here. How are you? I'm doing fine! Always glad to have a chance to meet magnificently stylish lady like you! Oh! "Ne nado, ne nado." Don't compliment me. You make me feel silly, because I am here to tell you bad news. What? I decided not to take that website to the court. Well, it's rarely bad news not to go to court. Bad news for the lawyer, no? Why did you change your mind, if I may ask? Marius, I was "dura". I was really stupid. I shouldn't be so provocative. This is Lithuania and I should respect people's feelings. I just wanna make fun, you know. I'm not sure I should. You should. - Cheers! - Cheers! So, what are these photos? It's very exciting, Marius. It's a first exhibition in our new place. We open in a few weeks. Everything is almost ready. The photographer is Arcana Femina. She works with masculinity. No titles, no explanations. - Impressive. - Yes! What?! You like him? I think it's very interesting. It's yours. Well, why not! But how much does it cost? Ah, forget it! It's a present from me. It's yours after the show. I don't know what to say... Thank you! I appreciate it. Darya, please, don't be offended, but can I ask you a personal question? Sure! I like honest questions. Ask away. I was just curious. I earn a good wage, I can't complain, but you have a lot of money. How does it feel to live without the need to think about the finances at all? You're right it's... It's a very personal question. But I will answer it for you. Money is nothing. It doesn't matter. It can't buy you happiness. But it's nice. I come from poverty, and I appreciate being rich. It has a lot of opportunities. So, I love my life! I thought that it never ends. That people want more and more money. Maybe my husband wants. For me it's OK. For him it's a competition. Not for me. It's wonderful to see you so happy. What happened, Marius? My father died. - A week ago. - Oh my god, I didn't know about that. I wasn't told. My condolences. 2 WEEKS LATER BELGRADE Hey! Hello Ali. Hello Marius. Come on! Let's go. That was the most original way I have ever met someone. Should we go to the hotel? There's no rush, is there? You are here for a week. Let me show you a place that I love! Let's meet there tonight. OK! Hi! Hi. I didn't think you would be so romantic. Oh... I figured you would think it's dangerous. It's so private, you could kill someone and no one would notice. Marius... I don't want you to think of me as a victim. You are too handsome to be a victim. And you are too naive to be a lawyer. I'm really pleased that you came to Belgrade, just to meet me. But? But... My clock will strike midnight soon... And I need to go back to my refugee camp at Krnjaca. That's where you spend the nights? Yeah. For how much longer? Well, once I get a bank loan and buy a new house, I think I'll leave the camp pretty much immediately. Ha-ha. So, what are the ways out? I want to go to further inside Europe. But the borders are closed for years. There are no easy ways. You want me to help smuggle you across? No, Marius. You look like an undercover cop. In your fantasies perhaps. Forget fantasies... You're a lawyer in real life. You should know someone, you should know a way. Ali, I'm a corporate lawyer. I know nothing about emigration law or refugee conventions. This is really a misunderstanding. I see. Look... I don't want to lie to you. You may be Cinderella, but I'm no Prince Charming. OK, I see, this is a misunderstanding. Hello Darya! "Privet" Marius! How are you? I'm OK, I'm in Belgrade, Serbia now. On vacation. Oh, you're abroad. I'm sorry, I didn't want to disturb you. I just want to ask for your help. You are not disturbing me, it's always a pleasure. You surprised me with how sad you sound. Can you tell me what has happened? I'm sad, I'm "ochin" sad. I'm divorcing with my husband. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What happened? I found him with another woman. Younger woman. Oh... Again, I'm sorry to hear. Marius, will you help me? I need a good lawyer, for the divorce. Because he will rob me, if I don't have a good lawyer. Oh, I understand your feelings, but I work with corporate law. I don't think I could be of much help. Marius, but I really need a good lawyer. Because our family lawyer will defend his interests. I could recommend you a good lawyer. Please Marius, help me. You know me, you know him too. He won't be able to fool you. I'm very sorry to say it, but... That's the problem, there's a conflict of interest. Our firm represents your husband's company. Even if I wanted, I couldn't represent you against him. I understand, it's business. Darya? Jesus! I remember when I started understanding my trans identity, I told my best friends, hoping for support. But... Instead of that... they called me a pervert and said I'm insane. I was really low. Everyday I woke up thinking, that... I would be better off dead. But then, on the Internet I found a community that accepted me and provided me with the information I needed. I got stronger. So yeah, I don't want to be seen as that trans guy. But I also do understand why it's important to come out. Last year something happened at the academy. One of my classmates was giving presentation about queer artists. Some students started asking him stupid and insulting questions. I was very hard for him and the teacher didn't help at all. So, I raised my hand and stood up for him. I said that I am trans, bi and that there's nothing wrong with that. And there were no more comments that day. There were no more comments at all after that. Welcome! Please, take a seat. I'm sorry for the mess, we're very busy here. Hello. Yes, I'm listening. Is this a bad time? It's not, it's just we don't have a lot of it. So how can we help you? Or maybe you came to help yourself? I wanted to ask a couple of questions. Yeah, go ahead. Can you tell me something about a special group or help networks for LGBT refugees, here in Belgrade. There aren't any. Even if he faces danger from other refugees? Then, he can ask to be moved to another refugee camp. And what if he faces problems again? Look, maybe you want to discuss a precise situation here? That would be easier for me. Couldn't a gay person be considered a vulnerable case and therefore, transferred to a refugee camp in a more gay friendly country? Look, I'll tell you a story. There were 10 teenage boys. The youngest was 12, the oldest was 15. They were all locked in here in an apartment in Belgrade. Who locked them in? The smugglers. Why did they do it? Because the boys wanted to cross the border, but didn't have the money to pay for it. So the smugglers locked them in and brought some clients. And they forced the kids to have sex with them, in the room next door. So to answer your question. Those kids who were forced to prostitute themselves, and raped and beaten by both the smugglers and the clients, they were vulnerable enough to be considered for the resettlement program. I just wish there was a way I could help someone. In any case, we don't work directly with the UN, with resettlement. You have to go to the UN refugee agency for that. - Milena! - Yes. Can you get me the email of the UN officer, who helped the Afghan gay couple from the Preševo camp, I think. - Anja? - Yes, Anja. OK. Here is her email. Thank you. Good luck! Can you go closer? No! Thank you. Excuse me, can you help me? Do you know this guy? - Oh, the model guy?! - Yeah, I saw him. - Can you call him? - OK! Thank you. Hi! Look, I screwed up. I'm sorry for how I behaved before. I want to do better. I want to help you. There are many refugees you could help. Thousands in Serbia, millions worldwide. OK, well... Let's start with you. Why bother? I'm not looking for Prince Charming. You told me yourself, it's important to be a good person. How did you even get here? I told them I was a journalist. A journalist from Fake News? What's your idea? Leave this place and come stay with me at the hotel. I'll help you resettle to the European Union as a gay refugee. I'm not gay. You are not? Don't worry... I'm bisexual. But I don't act that way. My type of guys aren't helped there. Nonsense. It's true. Look, I've made an appointment with United Nations officer tomorrow. She has helped LGBT refugees before. - Hello! - Hello, good evening. Would you like anything else? I'm good, thank you. It was room service. I thought you called the police. Thank you. Welcome. Oh, thanks. It's... It's comfortable. Sometimes it's good to get out of your comfort zone. No! Never! Never leave your comfort zone. If you don't need to. I have to ask you a few questions before I meet the UN. OK. Were you a victim of homophobic violence? I already told you I'm... I'm just escaping war. Yeah, but... I mean your experience here with the other refugees. Have you experienced any homophobia? No... No! Why would I? No one knows that I'm bisexual. Look, I know you don't want to be a victim. But you gotta give me something to work with. OK! I was managing a sweets shop in the outskirts of Damascus, that my friends Abduh and Mustafa had opened. It was hit on my day off. Mustafa and his wife Leyla were killed instantly. And Abduh was buried in the rubble for three days before they found him. He was the first person I came out to. And your family? My parents... Are pro-Assad. At least, they were at the time. My brothers were forced to join the army. My youngest brother Dawud was killed within months. And then my family decided to move further inside Syria, to avoid the fighting, and I decided to run to Europe. Because... I didn't want to fight for Assad. That's the story. I'm sorry. Please, understand Marius. I'm not a pacifist. I would gladly kill for something I believe in. But there's no hope for Syria with Assad in power. And there's no real alternative either. Ali... As a lawyer, I have to say, we have to make your case less political. We have to focus it on discrimination and human rights. Of course... Human rights. And where do you want to go? I want to go to Berlin, because Abduh's sister Anmar lives there. I think she and her friends could help me to find some work and integrate into German society. And you would also feel more accepted because of your sexuality, yes? Do you always ask so many questions on a first date? You see it as a date? I wish we would have met under different circumstances, but... So... Are you a good cook? Are you asking this for the UN, or for our date? Here are all my documents, including written testimonies. - Thank you. - No... Thank you! Where will this be published? Oh, no no no... I'm not a journalist. I'm a lawyer. I'm doing some research on gay refugees. We had an Afghan gay couple who faced problems with their compatriots in Preševo camp. They were transferred to Pirot reception center. The United Nations refugee agency has now taken them into its resettlement program. How bad was it? Bad. I guess I'm asking, how bad does it person have to be for a gay person to be resettled in another country? To get into our resettlement program, a gay refugee would need to meet the very stringent criteria of our program, just like any other refugee. Look... He just needs to leave. Off the record, where are you from? Lithuania. I'm from here. I studied law in Munich. I stayed there for years. I had a great life in Germany, but... I chose to go back and work in Serbia, because I wanted to contribute to the changes here. I'm saying this as a person, not representing the United Nations. There is a lot of space for improvement in this country, just like everywhere in the world. OK. And what if I would promise a kind donation to the UN refugee agency? I'd kindly ask you to leave and make the donation on our website. Hello. Hello. Wait... Well, how did you cook? I bought some stuff and used the tea pot. You're still afraid of the room service? So? It's tasty! I mean the meeting. Um... It didn't go well. Of course. Now I understand. You're not a victim. You're a hero. I'm neither a victim, nor a superhero. This is not a porn film, Marius, alright? So... What are you going to do now? Same thing I do every time. I'll go back to the camp. You are not the first nor the last. Remember our voyeur friend? He wants to come help me too. Many do. Refugees are trendy these days. Don't go back to the camp, Ali, stay with me. Why? For what? Because you want your live show? Don't say that! Don't say that. I'm tired, Marius. I just want to live a normal life. And I want to help you. You can't get help from a lawyer when the only things that work aren't legal. Don't... I love you. Just, so you know... This one is for free. What? It's silly. Just tell me. I feel like I'm not afraid to be weak with you. I do nothing and you earn a living as a lawyer. I'm not sure about your country, but in Syria you would be considered the tough one. When the war ends, we will rebuild everything. I will open a new restaurant with my friends and... I'm planning to take you there with us. Or if you want we can open it elsewhere. And what will be my favorite thing on the menu? Something simple. Simple, but intense. Like the apricot nectar called "Qamar al-Din". Good morning! Shh, come in! Good morning. Thank you! Could Mr Marius sign the receipt? Oh, but he's sleeping. Oh. We just got married and... I want to surprise him. So, you can understand. In that case, can you, please, sign for him? Oh sure, sure. Here! Thank you. Thank you for understanding. We just got married? You should be still sleeping. Oops, sorry... Speaking of husbands, let me show you this. My friends in Lithuania got engaged. - Really? - Hmm. They were always talking about love and now they're doing it. It's not even legal in Lithuania. Actually, we had some gay venues in Damascus too. Gay friendly cafes, parties that would happen in different places. It was fun. Abduh and I went to one. People were becoming more and more open minded about it during the revolution, but with the war, it all ended pretty quick. Let's just rent a car and leave. Let's bribe someone... Everyone. It just... It just doesn't work that way. I'm not ready for dramatic goodbyes, Ali. I hate them. Good luck! Good luck to you. Hi? Hi baby! What was that? I will check. You want some water? Yeah. OK. That's strange. Room service?
