You were married to that actress. Uh, technically still married. Oh, that sucks what she did to you. Um, the winery is 30 miles up that road right there past the old bridge. Hey, you wanna come with us? We could use a tour guide! [laughs] Uh, yeah, I-- [laughs] I've got a lot of work to do. Your loss. Ah! Son of a-- Yeah, nothing says summer like a nice hot fire. Well, at least you found somethin' to keep yourself busy. Ho, man! We gotta do somethin' to get you out of this funk. Have you met that new chick in town, Caroline? Not interested. I'm not saying you gotta marry her, Jake. Just go have some fun. I don't wanna be set up, Pete. My divorce isn't even final, yet. Come on, it's one dinner. How do you know she'd even go out with me? Because she already said she would. I told her I'd let her out of her parking ticket. Pete! What? That's what family's for, man. Death, divorce. Oh, and debt. I told ya I'd pay it back. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What do you think of this shirt, buddy? Well, you know what? You're not a fashion plate either, buddy. No, I look stupid. You think I should shave? Fine, I'll shave.

Wha-uh-- But she-she was going to the wineries, and on her way her car broke down, and I fixed it. The next thing you know, we're in Vegas getting married. [laughs] You don't have the goods? No, no. No, it's not that. She cheated on me. That was-- Oh, right! I heard that. They were making fun of you on Leno. Yeah, that-- You're not over her, are you? I-- Thank you. I'll take mine to go, please.

Amanda said she liked me because I was real. That is so sweet. What do you think? What do I think? I think you named it after Amanda's favorite flower. Lots of people like hyacinths. People like tulips and roses. Nobody even knows what a hyacinth is. Besides, that is "inth" not "enth" Rhodes scholar. Oh, crap! Let me get a beer. You're still on duty. Three to one. I'm off. (man) Ana! Hey, Victor. Sorry. [English accent] So, your father left you a rather large inheritance. Inheritance? How much? About 500,000. Oh, my. I'm sorry, I think you're getting the wrong idea. Uh, look. Here. Yeah? Right? Wow, 500,000 it's-- Wow, what is it? Here. Minus signs. You mean like negative signs? Like very negative. Your father left you a rather large debt. What-what do you mean a debt? This is not a debt. This is-this is not a debt. This is negative sign, negative sign, negative sign, negative sign, this is not right. This can't be right. And by law, the debt is now yours. Victor. You're kidding me, right? Don't do that. Don't do-- I never joke about the law. Or fashion. There is something. This might help. It seems he owned a piece of land in California in a town called Webster. Yeah, I-- I think I-I know what this may be. It's my father's mother, my grandma. She moved to the US before I was born. It's California real estate. Who knows? It could be worth millions! Take the picture already. Oh, my God. Don't be so self-conscious. You look great. He looks like a goober. Let me get a beer. Thanks a lot. Okay. I don't understand why I have to be in the picture for the ad anyway. You're asking people to come to your house. They need to see they can trust their host. When this ad comes out, your phone will be ringing off the hook. Assuming I can get the phone to actually work. Hey, Jake. Shaping up? Thank you. Still a fixer upper though. You're shaping up nicely, too, Celeste. You look great. Thank you for noticing. I've some registered mail for you. That looks pretty important. Hope it's not bad news. Thanks. It's just, uh, divorce papers. Sorry. Yeah, no big deal. She can come here herself if she wants me to sign them. Celeste? Wow, what happened to you? You used to be huge! Pete. I'm just-- You look awesome! It's all right. Thank you. You're welcome. I lost 50 pounds on my new diet. Wow! Hey! What do you think, Mr. Jake? I think we're taking another picture. Why is that funny? Why are you laughing? I do look like a goob. It turns out someone lives in the house. His name is Sullivan. That's all I could find out. I managed to wrangle an e-mail address from the county clerk there in Webster. How-how can he live in a house that's not his? How can he do that? I don't know, but it does make things more complicated. You can't sell it if he's in there. And if he won't move, you'll have to evict him. If you like, I could send a letter. No, you know, I can handle that. I think I can write him an e-mail explaining everything. He'll understand, right? Hey, use a little help here, handyman. One second there, Sheriff. Come here, take a look at this. So, you think this is the real deal? No, that's one of those scam things. And he's probably a brushing hacker in his mum's basement. Best thing you can do is just ignore it. And voila! Who says you're the only brother handy with tools? The top shelf is a little crooked. Where? That side is not-- Here? Really? Beer run. Screw...yourself. (Ana) Screw yourself? Screw me? Screw you! Ha! Have a nice day. [chuckles] I'll tell you what. I'll give 'em this. They are persistent. Hey, you know what? I know what'd shut them up. Shoot in the moon, like the old days. That would be funny, but-- You know what? What the heck, let's do it, Pete. Here we go. Say cheese. [chanting] Cheese! Hi, Maria. [talks in Spanish] What? [Seabellies sing 2571 ] Victor, thank you so much for helping me with Paulo. Thank you. I'm not sure it was the best thing. At least in jail he was safe. You know, he's not a teenager anymore. Now you're gonna have to sell that place. Mm, that would be a challenge. Here's his answer. Mm. Mm! Not bad. Can't we do anything? Well, I am a...fabulous lawyer. Mm. All right, very solid. There's not much you can do from Brazil though. If you're gonna settle this quickly, you'll have to go to the States. Victor, I'm broke. You know, with Paulo, with a debt, I can't do that. I can't! I'll tell you what. We'll both go. I'll spring for the tickets. I've loads or airline miles. Victor, you're so sweet, but I can't let you do that. Don't worry. When you sell the property, you can give me a percentage. Twenty per cent. Ten per cent. One percent, and I'm not going any lower. California, here we come. [woman's distant voice] Oh, this is interesting. (man) Always have to stay in somebody's bedroom. Why can't we stay at an impersonal hotel for a change? The place isn't even finished, yet. It's not unfinished. It's rustic. Actually it is unfinished. We don't open for another week and a half. I'm sorry. I told you we should've made a reservation. Come on, sweetie, let's go. Your ad says that you open April 1st. Oh, no, um-- We tried to call. Uh, I'm sorry, the phones aren't hooked up, yet. We're really not ready for guests, yet. This ad's a misprint. I'm sorry, I wish we could accommodate you, but-- Oh, but you have to. We tried to get a reservation everywhere. Because of the wine festival, it's impossible to get rooms. Ah, if you don't mind, um, a little bit of a mess, I suppose we could give it a shot. We don't mind. Okay. Maria! Maria. Yes, Mr. Jake? Um, we have our first guests here. Do me a favor. Go to the store. Get some food, and soap and towels, and anything else you think of. Everything I can think of. Got it. Just keep it under $50. Please. Um, okay, let me, let me get your bags, and I'll show you to your room. I would be honored. Here we go. Thank you. I appreciate it. Okay, thank you. Be careful. I got this, sir. No problem about that. Oh, here's your bag. Okay. Here's your bag. I'll take it. Don't worry about that. Uh, follow me up here. You are really strong. Thank you. Just follow me. He's very strong. Here we go. I love the wallpaper. Thank you. Ah! I feel like a cowboy! [shouts] Victor, don't do that! Drive like a sane person. I don't wanna end up in an American jail. Come on! Relax! Enjoy yourself. I can't enjoy until we get this resolved, until we sell this house. And I don't see any hotels here. Where are we gonna stay? Well, we'll take a look at your place first, and then we'll find somewhere. Okay. Mm. The land of the free. And I feel free ! [laughs] [grunts] Hey. Hey. Help me clean up. I've guests here.

[gasps] I love this place all right. Don't be silly. It's supposed to be lucky. What is it a bed and breakfast? Somewhere to stay. You think it's a good idea? It is your house, isn't it? Yeah. It is our honeymoon. Oh, con-- Congratulations. Okay, you know? I'll tell you what. Why don't you guys take the first one on the right side as you get up the stairs? Can I help you with your luggage or anything? Sure? Sayonara. Okay, sayonara. Hi. Hey. Um, are you here for a room? Well, this is a bed and breakfast, isn't it? Yeah, yes, sir. Well, almost. I guess officially now, yeah. I'm Victor. Victor Garcia. This is my beautiful wife, Sonia. We live in Spain, and we are here to savor the local wines. I'm Jake Sullivan. This is my place. And welcome. Please, come on in. Ah, so, you are Jake Sullivan? Yes, I am. Yes. Uh, may I ask what is a hyacinth house? What is it? Uh, hyacinth. A flower. So, how long will you be staying with us? Just one night. Possibly two. Yeah, and we want twin beds, please. He snores. Kills me. Yeah. You? This man is a lunatic. You ought to be in jail the way you drive. You two know each other? Yes, but we got off on rather the wrong foot. He means he almost ran over my foot. This is Maria. Maria, this is Sonia and Victor, and they are guests from Spain. [talking in Spanish] Yes. Always. I didn't know you were such a dynamic woman. Please. I am not that easily charmed. (Jake) Oh, okay. All right, I'm gonna get a key. Your room will be the third door on the right up the stairs. That's the one with twin beds. Luggage or anything? No, no, we're okay. Is there a real estate lawyer in town? Uh, yes, Hank Simmon's office, right in the middle of town. Are you interested in buying some property here in Webster? We're here just checking the value-- Sonia, darling. It's time for my siesta. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Certainly. Thanks. Oops! Okay. We're not completely finished. [laughter] Maria? Maria! I think I'm going to like it here. I warned you when you hired me. I'm not much of a cook. Maria, till we get this place up and running, we're all gonna have to do a little bit of everything. What is that smell? It's menudo, the only breakfast I know how to make. As soon as I can, I'll hire a chef. So...what did you think of that couple? The woman's sexy, don't you think? I didn't notice. You noticed. She's married, okay? So let's not even think about it. The man, he seems a little, um, what's the saying? Light in the loafers. Seemed European to me. That's another thing. I don't think they're from Spain. I don't even think he understands Spanish. Maria, when this place gets up and running, we're gonna have a lot of guests coming through here. I don't need you passing judgment on everyone. But I like to pass judgment. Maria, no. Ugh, that's bad. (Ana) Perfect. It's closed. What do we do? Take in some local color. Oh! This! This is the store of my dreams. Let's buy some clothes. You're joking, right? No way I'm getting in there. Oh, I am. Victor! Victor, please-- Howdy, partner? [laughs] [sighs] [tinkling] [tinkling] Oh. Oh, yes! Phones will ring-- [doorbell chimes] Howdy! [laughs] Ooh, where on earth did you get those clothes? Fabulous little shop right here in Webster. Now, maybe you can help me. Is there a cowboy bar in town? Yes, along the highway. But I don't know if we have the kind of cowboys you're looking for. What do you mean? I mean, what other kind of cowboys are there? There's only one channel on the TV. Static. And there's no cold water in the shower, no hot water in the sink. There's a hole in the floor where the toilet should be! Oh, I am so sorry. I forgot to put a toilet in your room. I don't mind. It reminds me of Italy. Mr. Sullivan, I don't know what kind of operation you think you're running-- I'm so sorry. I apologize. Why don't you guys take the rest of the day, go tour the winery, on me, of course. And when you return, I promise everything will be fixed. That sounds wonderful. Listen, don't you think-- They probably have bathrooms. Yes, they have. I'm sorry. Hello. Hi. Hey! Hello, baby! Oh, he likes you. What's his name? This is Kevin. I've always wanted to have a dog like this. Oh, no, no, no. He doesn't know he's a dog. He thinks he's my brother. [laughs] Me and my brother were never that close. Oh. Well, hey, would you like something to drink? Some water perhaps? Yeah, sure. Thank you. Okay, um, can I just ask you something? Sure. How long have you owned this place? Ah, a couple of years. You, you bought it? No, it was given to me. It was left to me by a friend when she passed away. Oh. It seems like an unusually generous gift for a friend, isn't it? Yeah, well, I was her handyman for a number of years. And, well, we got very, very close. You weren't, I mean-- No, no. No, no, no, no. I'm sorry I asked. She was 80 years old. Oh! No, absolutely not. I don't wanna be rude, but how did it get in such awful shape? It-it was left for a long time. And obviously I'm still fixing things up. In fact, we aren't supposed to be open right now, but the ad had the wrong date on it, so. What ad? The advertisement in the magazine. How did you guys hear about it? Oh. We were just passing by here. It's kinda out of the way place to just pass by. Yeah. I think we just got the wrong turn. Well, I'm glad you did. Okay, great. Thank you. See you around. [muffled voices, woman laughing] [exhales] [woman moaning] He must be like Superman. It drives me crazy. I can't think like this. Okay, I'm gonna tell them to keep it down. No, no, let's leave them alone. They're newlyweds. Who are we to interfere with love? Oh. Okay, I won't say anything. I'll be nice. [loud moaning] [message tone] Jesus. [loud moaning] [grunts] Victor! Turn the lights off! Ah! Good morning, Maria! Good morning! Mr. Okata. Mr. Okata, I have a great idea. Maybe you guys wanna take your breakfast in bed. (both) Oh! Oh, yes. If you need help with anything else, I'm very good in the kitchen. Yes, ma'am. Come on, Mr. Harvey. I'm not finished, yet. Sure you are. I don't wanna go. Bye. Bye. Come on, I said. Mr. Harvey is coming. Mr. Harvey has to go. Uh, more coffee, Sonia? Yes, please. Sure. Thank you. Did you have the chance to see Hank yesterday? No, the office was closed. Ah, sounds like Hank. Hank tends to work a 45-minute day. [laughs] Uh, if you guys are really serious about taking some property here in Webster, I'd be more than happy to show you around. Yeah, it would be nice, but you don't have to do that. It would be no trouble at all. We can always use new faces around here. Especially one as beautiful as yours. And, and I mean that in the most friendly possible way. Oh, it's okay. Mr. Sullivan, okay, I think I should tell you something. (Celeste) Morning. Now that-- Morning, Celeste. Hey. I have another package for you. It's from Amanda. Jesus, this horrible town. Does anyone work here? I don't know what to say. Oops. Sorry. Ma'am, does this Hank ever work? Only when I want to. You're Hank. Short for Harriet. And that sucks, right? Come on in. Jake Sullivan's place. He did a really nice job fixing it up, didn't he? Of course I helped him set up his business. So, what do you think it's worth? Never bothered to find out. Jake loves that place. I don't think he's ever gonna sell it. Is there somewhere where I can check the property records? Deeds, ownership, that kind of thing? That stuff is mostly down at the court house, couple of towns over. What are you two up to? [chuckles] Sure asking a lot of questions. [chuckles] We just fell in love with the place, that's all. No harm in asking, right? Well, if you're looking to buy some property, I got some super deals. It's a great time. More and more wineries are opening. Another year, this place is gonna be a bussling little hot spot. Possibly. But for now we need to get right down to the court house. Great. Another day stuck in Webster. I'll drop you off on the way over. I don't want you to die of boredom while I'm searching through records. Thank you. Victor, I can't stand all this lying. Did you say anything to Jake? No. I mean, I almost did. I couldn't help it. He's so nice. You are not having second thoughts, are you? Of course not. I need the money. I have to get Paulo out of trouble, to pay the debts. This is not even an option, right? [Brazilian music] Hello, Jake. Hey! Sonia, how are you? Did you finally get to see Hank? Yeah, yeah. Lemonade? I think it's still cold. Yeah. Thank you very much. Uh, I was thinking of catching some sun. Do you know where is a good place? Uh, any place there's a chair. The backyard is really nice. Okay. Good. Good job. Thank you. [clears throat] Wow. [soft Brazilian music] [clears throat] [couple moaning] [woman moaning loudly] Mr. Jake! Mr. Jake. What's the matter? I have something to tell you! What is it, Maria? I did some snooping in their room. Maria, we are not supposed to snoop on our guests. We're supposed to respect their privacy. I told you something was wrong with them. I found a plane ticket from Brazil, not Spain. So what? It doesn't matter. And they're not married. They're not even sleeping together. I told you he was afeminado. Maria, it doesn't matter. And her name is not Sonia, it's Ana. And I found this. Hey, that's my-- I'm afraid that is your ass. So, can we arrest them? I don't know, Jake. I arrest kids for smoking weed. This whole international mafia syndicate Web stuff is not up my strong suit. My guess is we just sit still till they make a move. Hello, everyone. I just need some more cream here. How's the coffee, Sonia? It is Sonia, right? Yeah. Why do you say it like that? You tell me. Ana. Oh. You were snooping in my room. If you think that you can scam me out of my house, you can forget about it. That's right, sister. We don't take too kindly to cyber crime interweb stuff around these parts. Hold on, Pete. I got this. That guy upstairs, he's not even your husband, is he? Okay, no, he's my lawyer. Ha! He's my lawyer, and I brought him with me to help me take back my property, right? Your property? Yeah, my property. This land was given to me by my grandmother. This land was left to me by Flo in her will. So, put the clues together if your brain can handle it. Florence was my grandmother. Your-your grand-- Your grandmother? Yeah, right. Yeah, I inherited it, and I have the deed to prove it. Anybody can create a deed with a fake printer. Oh, fake! I have Flo's will, here in this house. Oh, really? You can show me, but it won't work. I have the deed! I have her will! I'll take the deed and I'll show you and it won't work. Put your clothes on, sister. We dress for breakfast in this country. What are you looking for, Mr. Jake? Flo's will. Miss Hank took all the important papers to keep them safe. Safe from what? Safe from you. Fine. I'll go to her office then. Not without me. I want this resolved now. Fine. Right now. "To Jake Sullivan I leave the house at 33 Miracle Way. Thank you for being my friend through most difficult times." May I see? This is hardly a legal document. It isn't even notarized. Although I must say the stationery is rather lovely. Uh, this clearly won't stand up in a court of law. What? I don't know how you do things in Mexican court. Brazil. Tomato, tomato. Jake, this is perfect. He's got you there, Jake. Without an official will, property goes to the nearest relative. Me. What? Why didn't you tell me this earlier? Well, it just seemed something better left alone at the time. Who would think that somebody was crawling out of the woodwork? Okay, great. Now we can sell the house and get the hell out of here, if we can ever make it presentable. Okay, let's go. This is ridiculous. I'm sorry, Jake. We'll fix it. Hey, I could kill him. Pete. It's just an option. Just saying. [tinkling] Well, I think now I can buy something for...for my house. Ah! Hey. I just wanna tell you I did not come to America to cause you trouble. And...we need to discuss how to proceed. You don't have to be out just yet. Why don't you rent the house to me? I'll pay you what I can upfront, and then as soon as the business gets up and running, you'll make your money back quickly. I would if I could, but...I need a full amount and I need it now. Flo may have been your grandmother, but she was my friend. If she wanted you to have the house, she would have left it to you, you know. In the whole time that I knew her, she never even mention that she had a granddaughter. She never talked about any family at all, ever. Of course, because I never got to meet her. She-she married an American. She left Brazil before I was even born. Now, I know my will is not official, but I have no doubt that Flo wanted me to have this house. I don't blame you for feeling this way, but...it still doesn't change anything. I you think I'm just gonna give up and roll over, you can forget about it. I'll fight you. And you will lose. [telephone rings] (Pete) Jake. Jake. Jake. Jake! Wake up. We found something in the law you're gonna love. Because she hasn't lived here in years and hasn't paid any of the property taxes, you can have this place over again. You just have to go and pay the taxes yourself, and you don't even have to pay them all. Just enough to get your name on the books. Yeah, write a $20-check, fill out a few forms, maybe it's yours again! Are you sure? So says the statute right here. Let's go then! Oh, right. Let's go! Yeah, okay, hey, I'll drive. Okay. This is great. I knew you could do it, Pete. That's perfect. Thank you so much. You got this whole situation-- Jake, how many did you have? I had two. That's what they tell every cop. Two and a half. Wait until I get in the car! Jake, I swear to God, you puke in the car, I will shoot you. [Brazilian music] [knocking on door] Hope you kept the receipts for that job. Why? What are you talking about? You're not getting the house. I don't get it. You didn't pay taxes on it. I did! Squatter's rights, baby! No! This is not right, okay? And I'll take it to court. Fine, take it to court. It'll take months, years even, and I will fight you every step of the way. Jake, the house is mine. You know it already. It's not your house. I pay taxes. The house is mine. The house is mine. Shut up! There is a way to sort this out. Mediation. You present your cases to a retired judge and he makes a decision. I've even found one for you. [laughs] Yeah, there's no way I'm gonna trust anybody you found. Actually, I'm the one who found him. My former employer, Judge Connor. Well, if it brings an end to all this, then fine. Okay. Fine with me. Fine. Fine. That's fine. Good. [exhales] We make a good team. I suppose we do. What do you say you and I, we have a night on the town? I don't think I would want to go where you want to go. Oh, all right. I guess it was a bit presumptuous of me. I mean, why would you want to go on a date with me? You were asking me out on a date? But I thought you were for the men. Oh, my God. Is that what miraflor means? Maria, I'm not gay! But the way you talk and the way you dress and your makeup. Why does everyone think I'm gay? I'm just...English. [ringing] Hey, phone works! [ringing] Phone works. Hyacinth House, bed and-- It's me. Amanda? Yeah, it has been a long time. How do you think I've been? You may be used to having the whole world know your business, but I'm not. You know I said I would sign those papers, no problem, but you need to bring them down to me yourself. At least give me that little bit of dignity. This really is not a good time. Let me try to call you back later tonight. Ooh. Are you okay? Yeah, what do you care? Let's go. Is it far? It's a few hours at least. Okay, okay, okay. I need a minute. Just one minute. I'll be back! Take your time. There's my boy. There's my boy! You're so good. You're so good! You look comfortable. Yeah, thanks. There's nothing to do here, right? Nothing at all. What is your problem with Webster? 'Cause it's boring. It's a dump. Everything's so run down. Shall I go on? Okay, I'll give it to you. Downtown Webster is not much to look at, but once we get out into wine country, it is...it's amazing. You'll love it. All the vines are starting to grow right now, and it's like the whole valley is coming alive. Of course the summer's, summer's the best time. It's tourist season, and...I can't even explain to you the energy of the place. And then the fall comes along, and all the vines turn into the most amazing colors of red, yellow. I wish you were more of a bastard. Yeah, it would be a lot easier for me if I...if I hated you. [chuckles] Likewise. It'd be much easier for me if you were more of a bastard. [Seabellies singing Feel it Leave ] [no audible dialog] Howdy, folks. How you doing today? Good. Uh, real good. (Ana) Are you the judge? Thirty years on the bench. Don't tell me. Let me guess. Lover's quarrel, right? [laughs] Hardly. It's a property dispute, Your Honor. Same thing. Come on, let's go inside and... see if we can get this business sorted out. Okay. [exhales] Well, let's start with couple's dialog. We're not a couple. Sure. Tell you what. I want you to drink some tea. Drink up. Ana, you want the house. How do you communicate that to Jake? The house is mine. Get out! Ouch. Exactly. Well, how does that make you feel, Jake? Like crap. The house is mine. You get out. Ouch! Ouch! Okay, Ana, I want you to say this to Jake. Jake, the house you're living in was left to me by my grandmother. I'm so sad that I never got a chance to meet her. But she is my family. And a week ago, my father died of a heart attack. And I miss him so much that the grief hasn't even hit me, yet. And the only thing he left me is an incredible amount of debt. The Bed and Breakfast is my only hope to free myself. I don't know what to do. What would you do? What would you do? I'm sorry. Namaste. That'll be $700. [turns radio on] [turns radio off] I'd rather wallow in silence, if you don't mind. [sighs] What are you gonna do next? I've no idea. The Bed and Breakfast was my fallback plan, so. Yeah. Maybe whoever I sell it to, will let you run the business. We both know that's not very likely. I'm sorry, Jake. I'm sorry. I-- Please, stop saying you're sorry. It just makes me feel worse. I'm sorry. [laughs] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [laughs] Ah! Okay. I'm sorry about your family. Yeah. [clanking] Hell. What? The-the-- Come on. Come on! Come on, come on. What happened? The car died. Hello! Hm! Hello! Anyone here? God, it's so hot! Hello! [gasps] I'm sorry. We weren't expecting. Well, you will be expecting, if you keep that up. Hello. Hello. Hi. Please, sign in. Thank you. All the decent places are full with a waiting list. You know, with the wine festival in town. So. Is this place even finished? Oh, the grand opening is in a week. Mm-hm. Hopefully. How long will you be staying? Two nights. And I want to reserve dinner for tomorrow night as well. Okay, let me find your key. [laughs] [chuckles] If there were anywhere to go, I would tell you guys to get a room. Speaking of which, where is my room? Oh, upstairs to the right, to the left, to the right. Left, right, left. Thanks. [laughs] Maybe we should go somewhere private. And dark. [laughs] Don't even try to get a cell phone signal out here. No? No way? Uh-uh. We can walk. How far are we from town? Oh, we're just like 40 miles either direction. And if we're gonna walk, we're gonna walk in the morning because this is mountain lion country. Wow. So, this is what you call emergency supplies, right? Sorry, Your Highness. If I knew I was gonna have company, I would've had caviar and champagne. Cheers. Mm. Can I make a personal question? Sure, you can make a personal question. Who were you fighting with before on the phone? That's my soon to be ex-wife. What happened between you? A long story. I think we have time. She's an actress. Oh. Not Julia Roberts or anything like that. She's well known in television. I moved down to L.A. with her in a big house in the Hollywood Hills. It sounds exciting. More like humiliating. Everything was about her and her fame. Yeah. So, she gets this role in a movie, finally, and she hooks up with her co-star. No! And didn't even have the guts to tell me about herself. Her assistant has to tell me. Then I got to see all the pictures in the tabloids. It was awesome. Wow. That's why you're angry. You should. I would be angry, too. I'm not angry. I'm just embarrassed. It's not-- That wasn't me. I didn't belong there. What about you? Do you...have a boyfriend or a husband? I have a fiancé. Yeah. Or maybe he's just a boyfriend. Or-or maybe he's nothing. I-I don't know where we stand anymore, you know. He's like a child. He only thinks of himself. It's pretty much like your, your-- Yeah, we should get the two of them together. [hiccups] Sorry. Oh! [both laugh] I'm sorry. It happens. That's embarrassing. [laughing] I'm so sorry. Happens to the best of us. Look at you! Beer, beef jerkey. We'll make an American girl out of you yet. Yeah. Yeah! Yeah, man! [laughing] Very good. Ugh. There you two are. You got everybody worried sick. Yes, sweetheart, you're dressed. And you, [clicks tongue] you're losing touch.

Now, where is he right now? He got up early this morning and went to the vineyard. Is this a problem? Yes, this is a problem. Pierre Hopewell is like the biggest reviewer in all of California. If he doesn't like the place, they might as well close their doors down right now. I can't believe he saw the place like this. There's another thing. He made a reservation for dinner. Where? Aqui. Hey! Hey. What are you doing? Making dinner. There's a very important reviewer staying here tonight, that's why I make sure that he's impressed. Jake, what does it matter if you get a good review? You are planning to honor our agreement, aren't you? Yes, absolutely, of course. It's just-- I put a lot of work into getting this place ready, so. I'd like to know if it would've been successful. If it would've lasted. You-you can't serve him this. It's horrible. Well-- Come with me. Where are we going? Let me take charge, okay? Okay. Oh, God, what is this thing made of?

Go, go, go go. You look beautiful. [bell dinging] Hi. Is this the same place I left this morning? Sure it is, yes, sir. We're still fixing it up a bit, but people really wanna stay here, so we opened our doors a little bit early. Jake Sullivan. Very nice to meet you, sir. We'll see. Well, you got here right on time. Dinner is ready when you are. I was born ready. Lead the way. Yes, sir. Um, everyone, please say hello to our newest guest. Pierre. Pierre, everyone. Hello, Pierre. (all) Hello. Are all your meals this big a production? Well, we want every night to be one to remember. Okay, wine anyone? Right here, sir. Guest of honor. (Victor) Amazing food and perfect wine. (Mrs. Okata) This food is fantastic! [mixed voices] [Brazilian music] (Victor) Fabulous. This Vaselli salad is excellent. [Brazilian music] [no audible dialog] I propose a toast. To love, life, liberty, and lots of wine. [toasting in Portuguese] [Brazilian music] I gotta tell you, that was the best dinner I think we've had in years. We're gonna take a walk. Don't wait up. No, we won't. They are so very cute. Yeah. I think she might-- She likes you a lot. Too much wine. But here we go. [laughs] I've gotta turn in. I've to be in Saratoga first thing in the morning. Mr. Hopewell, I have to ask you, what do you think? So, you know who I am. Yeah. I guess there's no hiding anymore. What do I think? Well...I think you two have put together the perfect blend of both the exotic and the familiar. The exotic being the most risky. Risqué. Familiar being the most comfortable. Keep it up, you're bound to go far. Salud. Salud. And to think if there had been a room anywhere else, I might have missed the best meal of my life. I guess this is what you call serendipity. I love that word. Goodnight you guys. Goodnight. Goodnight. Did you hear that? Yeah. [glass clinking] [laughing] That word, "serenidip", "serenidipi", [laughs] what is? Serendipity. It means when something pleasant happens unexpectedly. A happy accident. Serendipity. Serendipity. Jake? Amanda? It's me! Wha-- Wow. That's all I get? I'm just very surprised to see you. You didn't call me back last night. So I thought, what the hell, I'll come and see you. Amanda, this is Ana. Hi. Nice to meet you. Nice meeting you. Are you the new maid? I think I should go. Bye. Goodnight. Ana...Ana is Flo's granddaughter. Who's Flo? Flo, the woman who left me this house. I've told you a hundred times. Oh, right, right. I remember now. Oh, maybe. Oh, it's so good to see you. Wow! [laughs] I'm just shocked. Nick. Nick. His name's Kevin. Come on, mammy and daddy time. Let's go! Sorry, bud. Tickle my feet. Amanda. Tickle my feet. Come on. Tickle, tickle. Amanda. Tickle my feet. I am very, very confused here. Why? You asked me to come. To sign the divorce papers. That's what I asked you to come here for. Oh, those. I tore them up. I had some time to think and, [sighs] I want a second chance. Hello, Kevin. I feel the same way. Amanda, honey, wait. Wait. Would you just hold one second? Come here. Come back to L.A. with me. Sell this old place. It's not even mine to sell anymore. I thought you owned it. Ana owns it now. Flo, her grandmother, left it to her. It's a long story, but now she is trying to sell it, so-- I have a better idea. Shh. I'll buy the place. I'll buy it, and you can come back and visit whenever you want. Do whatever it is you need to do. Visit? I wanna live here in Webster. I'm not living in Webster. Forget about Webster. We'll live in the penthouse in New York, or the beach house in Venice. What's wrong with Webster? I-I grew up here. I was born and raised. I like it here. Listen, Jake, I got a lot of bad press after our breakup. My manager says he's gonna have a hard time finding me work if we don't get back together. I love you, sweetie. I love you. Amanda, you should go. [muffled voice] I love you. I will go. I-- Tell your lawyers I'll sign the papers tomorrow. Don't think you're getting any of my money. We signed a pre-nup, remember? Amanda, I don't want anything of yours. Good luck with your career. When you change your mind, call my assistant. [grunts] [guests mixed voices] Hi. Hi. Are you kids taking off? Hi. Arigato. [talks in Japanese] Thanks for everything. This is best time we ever had. It was wonderful. We really enjoyed having you. Where are you guys headed next? We go to Chico one week. Chico? Chico, California? There is nothing to do in Chico, California. Perfect. Oh. Ha! Sayonara. Travel safely. [door closes] [sighs] Ana? Maria, wh-- Where's Ana? She left. What do you mean she left? She's not supposed to leave until tomorrow. She said she had to be at home. Her flight leaves in an hour. Victor's going to be staying with me until the house sells. Hopefully a little longer.

Come on. I wanna stay. I wanna see the tourist season, and the vines come red and yellow, and the valley become alive again. You can do that. It's your house. It's our house. Our Bed and Breakfast. We can be partners, no? That works for me. If you told me a week ago that I would be here in Webster, California, and...I wanted to stay forever, I would say you were crazy. Now...this whole trip is "serenpidity", right? [laughs] Serendipity. Serendipity. That was good. Now I'll show you the Brazilian way. Oh, yeah? So, so that's what we call it. [laughs] Okay. [laughs] I like it a lot. Do you? Yes. No one knows what this hyacinth is. Hyacinth, it is a flower. The worst name ever. Big problem.
