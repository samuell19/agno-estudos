Number 13. Number 14. 49. - 12. And number 43. - Yes! The rest of you, thank you very much. - Are you finished? - Uh... Yeah. I'm sorry. - I couldn't help myself. - Do you like the piano? Yes. It... It's-it's like playing a Ferrari. What do you usually play? A beater Ford Fiesta. Where is my assistant? I think she went to get change for my tip. So you're the delivery boy? - Yeah. - The croissants you brought last time weren't fresh. Oh, that-that wasn't me. Uh, might want to try our bagels, though. They're-they're awesome. But I'll-I'll tell my boss about the stale thing. Please do. And next time you come, play Schubert. What do you mean, come back and play your piano? Yes. Okay. Thank you. I-I'm Charlie, by the way. Don't come any closer! Aleya! - What are you doing here? - Oh! I-I was just, I... This is Madame Latour's private quarters. I told you to wait in the foyer. I'm sorry.

We got Joe. - Does he ever take a vacation? - Not in 30 years. All right. So have you ever heard of extreme baking? Hey! And finally he's back. Hey. How's it going? - How was the old bat? - Uh, not happy. - She said the croissants were stale. - That's bull. Did she come out of her cave to tell you that? No. Have you ever seen her? Dude, no one has. Hey, we're gonna go shoot some hoops after work. You down? - I got to practice. - Ah, you got to live, too, man. Yeah, well, for me, that is living. See you. First you've got to find the kid, right? The port. He's got to go find the key. It's brutal. Don't think. Do. You're never gonna get a shave as manly as this. Great decision. You're a smart guy. Hit me with that credit card. - Thank you. - I got you something. A pretzel. What do you want? I need someone to cover my shift. - I have an audition tomorrow. - Another one? - What happened today? - They cut me. Incoming. Hello, this is Lewis Granderson for Shave. Yes, sir, I can certainly organize that for you. How are you feeling, sir? Feeling strong? Hello? Hello, Mrs. Parker, this is Barlow Bennett with the Super Shave Club. - Who? - How are you today? How did you get my number? Hello? - What happened? - She hung up. You didn't hit her with your pre-emptive statement. - She wouldn't let me. - No excuses. Get another call on the line. Let's go! Yes, sir. I can come in for you tomorrow. Thank you, Lewis. I'm gonna get this one. You wait and see. I hope so. You suck at telemarketing. Hello? - Are you there? - Hello, sir, yes. Bochi's.

I can't believe Zander cut the front line. - I mean, who does that? - It's a power trip. Here he comes. Nice work, guys. Well, we have to go. We have a show tonight.

I told you I was a good turner. Yes, you did. Where are you headed? Thought I'd celebrate. Pop into a dodgy salon, cut my hair, dye it blue. Maybe get a face tattoo. Come on. I'll give you a lift.

I can pay you back. I've already rented the apartment. - Hey. Great job tonight. - Thanks. Hey, Billy. Tell you're bringing this guy back to play? Wish I could, kid. Our regular called. He can play tomorrow night, but, uh, nice job. Right. Sorry, man. See you around. - Split six ways. - Thanks. Uh, please, keep me in mind. Yeah. Sure, buddy. Thank you. See you around. Anyone got change for a C-note? Yeah. One, two... four... six... - And a one... - And across the floor... Guys, you need to make it across the floor there... Uh, one... two... four... Better, good. Seven and eight... Nice. - You're rushing. Hey. - And a five, six... - Here we go... - Hey, drummer, I am talking to you, stop rushing. - And a six... - Barlow, you have to make it across the stage there, which might be possible if the drummer wasn't still - rushing! - Seven and eight. - One... - Run, run, hit! No, stop. Stop! Stop! Stop! What is it about rushing that you don't understand? - I'm not rushing. - Look. I've said how many times today? Wh... I-I don't... I don't get it. Murray? W... How do you find the tempo? Mm? Is he, is he rushing you as well? Is, is it me? I don't... Oh, and he's gone. Good, here, take your bag. There you are. - Oh! - Whoa! Dancers, let's take five. Hello? I left the food on the table, so... I'm off. I thought we had an appointment. Actually, I didn't get a chance to work on the Schubert. That's disappointing. Yeah. Well... sorry. That's it? No excuse? I don't have one. That attitude's not gonna help, you know. If you don't know how to play Schubert, you could have offered to play something else. Nothing is popping into my head. There's an entire library of sheet music in there. Zander... there you are. What was that? Get me another drummer. - No. - What? It's the first day, everyone's on edge... just give him a minute to cool off. Kiss and make up. And then get on with the rehearsal. Hey, look, okay, I can't work with him. Okay? I know his type. He's toxic. And that smug attitude, it'll spread through the cast like poison, until it infects our whole show! And where is Ben? I told you, he's on another show till next week. Tell Ben that if he still wants to be my music director, then he better get over here and handle this. Please! Stop! You're playing with rage. That's how I'm feeling. It's a destructive emotion. How would you like me to play it? With passion. It's much more versatile. Would you like to play it for me? I can't. Why not? My hands grew old. I'm sorry. That must be awful. It is. You're angry because you're young and talented, and you're wasting your days delivering for a deli. You should do something about that. God, I hope this show doesn't close before it even opens. Could that happen? In this business? Anything can happen. Hey, did your roommate get that cruise ship job? - Yeah. - Want to rent her room? No... I'm thinking I should have taken that gig. I'm looking for a room. Ben... Thank you for getting over here, my friend. - Thank you. - Don't thank me yet. The musicians aren't coming back. - What? Neither of them? - Of course not. - They're best friends. - Yep. Fine. Okay, fine, we'll, uh, we'll just rehearse without them. I put some calls out, so just, just hang tight. - Okay? - Okay. Good. Sam... - Mom? - Well, are you gonna let me in? Please try to contain your excitement. I'm sorry. I just didn't expect to see you here. Well, if you checked your phone, you would. - I was in rehearsal. - Oh. What rehearsal? I was gonna tell you. I just needed a breather after our last conversation. Well, that was hardly a conversation. So now you're not speaking to me? Well, I don't know what you want me to say. I got a dance job that you're going to absolutely hate, and I've been evicted from this apartment because my roommate ripped me off, like you said she would. So... actually, it's perfect timing for you to say, "I told you so." What's the job? "Free Dance," the world tour. Are you featured? There's only one lead, and they're going for a name. - You're a backup dancer? - Yes. But Zander Raines is choreographing. I know all about that show. Of course, because you know everything. I just know what is right for you. Look, I'm not talking as your mother right now, I'm talking as your teacher. I could help you get into a world-class ballet company, where you could make a name for yourself. And then you could guest in other companies and choreograph and teach. I mean, there's longevity in that. Dance is a short career. You're not gonna be young forever, trust me on that one. I don't want your career. That was your dream. "Free Dance" is mine. - Well, you're wasted there. - I'm not. - All I need is a shot. - Well, you're never gonna get one. That's why they're called backup dancers, 'cause they're always one step behind the star. Well, have you found somewhere else to live? Possibly. Well, you can come back home if you need to. Thanks.

Oh, yeah. No, I'm... I'm great. As you can see, we're actually in the middle of a rehearsal. Um, so thank you for the bagels. Uh, did I... did I leave enough money for you to fix your bike? - Oh. Yeah. No, um... - Good. Good. But there is something you can do for me, actually. Here it comes. I want to audition for your show. Yes. Um, well, we're actually gonna move for an A-list player this time. - I mean, no offense, but... - Give me a shot. I can play for you right now. and if you guys don't like me, I'll leave. Yeah, look, Charlie, I-I, uh... I heard you play at Moxie's. You were on your phone. He was amazing. Okay. Fine. Sheet music's on the piano. 16 bars to impress me. Okay, thank you. Take it from the second movement of act one, please. He's good. The kid works at a deli. Yeah, I know. It's crazy. - Pretty awesome. - All right, well, - I'll see you, man. - See you, man. - Charlie. - Hey. - Barlow. - So, did you get the gig? Yeah. I'm so excited for you. How's your head, by the way? Oh, it... Spinning? Yeah. I have to quit my day job. That's a great feeling, isn't it? Yeah. Thank you, uh, for vouching for me. Oh. You're welcome. - So, are you waiting for Zander, or... - No. Paloma and Keke. I'm checking out their room for rent. - Oh, cool. - Hey, are you ready? - Yeah. Nice playing today, maestro. Thank you. Well, I'll see you tomorrow. I will see you tomorrow. - Do you mind if we... - Yeah, absolutely. Bye. This is it. So, that's Ava. She's at Juilliard. Oh. She practices a lot. Hey, Barlow's thinking about renting out Tina's room... Yeah. - Okay. - She'll represent. Hello? Um, Madame Latour, it's-it's Charlie. Charlie? What is it? Um, I have some news. I got a job playing the piano. In that show, "Free Dance." We, uh, we open on Broadway. Oh. That's wonderful. You know, I figured you would understand what a big deal this is. Getting a job like this isn't just a-a living. It's a life. Yes. Well, I just wanted to let you know you sort of motivated the whole thing. So... that's it. Bye. Okay, Ava. Now it's our turn. Oh! Yes, Keke! Ooh! Hey! Paloma, yes. Yes, P. Ooh! Mm-hmm. Ah... Come on. Ha! Keep it down over there! She is going to fit right in. Oh, yes. - Yeah. - Took it too much over... Yeah, yes. We're gonna have to do a little bit more work - on that. - Yeah, no, definitely. Okay, cool, man. - If you just take that there. - Okay. Hey, Ravi. We were just, um... - What's with the face? - My wife's throwing me a surprise birthday party. Okay, and-and how - did you find out about that? - She can't keep a secret. It's turned into a full-on production. - It will cost me a fortune. - Oh. Barlow. Can I see you? Thanks for this little chat. I feel so much better now. ZANDER Uh, yes. I need a body to stand in for Kayla. - Kayla Jordan? - Yeah. - Ravi, do you have a minute? - She just signed the deal. - We need that name for ticket sales, Zander. - Um, yeah. I know. That's your job, Ravi. - You're the producer. - Yeah! Yeah. Um, can you take your sweats off, please? Uh, Sammy, can you jump in with Barlow? - She's gonna stand in for Kayla. - Yeah, sure. Hey. Can you lift her from there? - Yeah. Like this? - Yes. - No, no. Let me? - Okay. Can you, uh, can you stand there? - Yeah. - Take a look, please. Yep. That's beautiful. Touch my chest. Nice. Turn and wrap. And developpé up. Look at me. Pouring onto the ground like liquid. Turn. Turn. - Good. Will you remember that? - Yes. Do you think Kayla will be able to handle that? - Hope so. - Okay, cool. - If you, uh, give that to... - Hey. Hey, what was that about? I was standing in for Kayla Jordan. - What? - No way. Kayla Jordan? You ready, man? - Yeah. - Good. Listen, um, what was that melody you were playing? Oh. I-I was just fooling around. Oh, so it's original? - I like it. - Really? - Yeah. - Well, it's yours, if you want it. I might take you up on that, Charlie. Thanks. Okay, guys! Let's take it from the hip-hop section. Uh, Barlow? You're back into your normal place in the corps. Let's do it. Let's go. Six, seven, eight. Two. And seven and eight. A one and... Seven, eight, ho! Latour residence. Uh, it's Charlie. Uh, Madame Latour? Yes, Charlie? I brought you some fresh croissants from the French Bakery. Oh. How nice. Well, this is my last delivery, so, uh, I wanted to make it a good one. - Last delivery? - Yeah. I've started rehearsals, so, uh, not working at the deli anymore. And so it begins. A life of triumph, agony, joy and heartbreak. - I welcome it. - You have no choice. You are an artist. The life chooses you. Will you come back and play sometime? I do value our discussions. It would be a lot easier if we could discuss these things face-to-face. That's a problem. Why? I've always communicated through my music. Without it, I don't do very well with people. Oh. Well, that sucks. Guess I'll just have to continue my fascinating relationship with your door. You don't know what you're missing out on, though, uh, seriously. I'm wearing a really cool outfit today. It's-it's, uh, pretty fly. Hello. Hello. Well, Charlie, that outfit is quite fly. Well, I think this calls for a celebration song. Do you have any requests? Oh. I have to think about that. Have you ever tried prepared piano? - No. - It was quite progressive back in the day. I think I have a book on it somewhere over here. Shall we, madame? - You can call me Rose. - All right. I think it's, I think it's this one. How do they do it? That is so cool. Zander, did Robbie get ahold of you? Uh, yeah. I'm gonna go and see him now. You don't have to stop. Oh. No, no. I'm-I'm finished. I was just trying out a new loop. It was really cool. You should see what you inspired in the break room. Nice. Is it okay that I'm in here? I feel like I killed - your mojo. - No, that-that would be impossible. - Oh. - I just mean that... you would be the one to, you know, inspire me, so... That's a beautiful piece. Oh, well, they call it the emotional magnifier. When you're melancholy, it makes you more sad. When you're nostalgic... it makes you more wistful. What do you feel when you hear it? Dreamy. What about you? Romantic. - Hey, Ravi. - Hey. Good to see you, my friend. - I ordered for you. - Oh, thank you. - What are we having? - Steak. What's the occasion? Kayla fell out. That's not what I thought you were gonna say. After all the wack negotiation of every single piece of insignificant minutiae, she's passing? Unbelievable. They're circling a studio film for her. A horror flick, I think. Oh, that's such a huge mistake. Well... screw them, okay? - We don't need her. - We need a star, Zander. - Dance is the star, Ravi. - I can't put that on the marquee. You know that pretty brunette from that medieval series, what's her name? - No, no. - She's hot right now, and her people approached us, so we could close her quickly. - She can't dance. - So what? The average audience doesn't know the difference anyway. - Oh, come on! - All they care about is who is starring in the show; you know I'm right. No, you underestimate them. Then you put your money on the line. - See how it feels. - We talked about this from the beginning, okay, Ravi? There'll be no compromising on the quality of the dance. You have amazing dancers. Yes, but the lead, Ravi, the lead has to be transcendent! You can modify the choreography. Protect her. - You mean dumb it down. - If you have to. Listen to yourself. Listen to yourself! That's the biggest piece of bullshit that I have ever heard coming out of your mouth! - What's his problem? - Excuse me. Zander, please. Zander! - Would you hold up? - I told you, okay? I told you. Wait, wait. Hey, Paloma! Have you seen Barlow? Uh, yeah, she's in wardrobe. - Ah, amazing. Thank you. - Mm-hmm. - Hey. - Hey. - What's up? - Nothing much. - Barlow? - Hi. Hi. Uh, I need to talk to you. - Oh, okay. - Sorry, can we, uh, - can we have a sec? - Sure. - Thank you. - What's going on? Can you handle this show? Of course. Is there something wrong?

I'm so sorry about this new casting. I wanted to say something to you last week, but Zander wanted to tell you. You found out last week? Yeah. I'm so sorry. Don't worry about it. Listen, Zander doesn't mean to be insensitive. He's just so insanely gifted that when he's creating, there's no room left in his brain for anything else. He doesn't realize how it affects other people. And I don't mean to make any excuses for him. There's no excuse for lying. No matter how gifted you are. So, as I'm, uh, sure you've all heard by now, our star is joining the "Free Dance" team. Here you are. The beautiful and fabulously talented Kayla Jordan. Hi, my love. Mwah. Mwah. I'm so sweaty. I'm sorry. No, you're good. Thank you, guys. I am so excited to be here. You're all so beautiful and I can't wait to see you dance. Great. So let's get it started. Barlow, can I...? Um, can you dance the lead so Kayla can see her part? - Sure. - Good. Okay, everyone, let's take it just before the pas de deux section, please. And music. ♪ It was a perfect storm ♪ ♪ You told such lovely tales about the future ♪ ♪ Your voice was soft and warm ♪ ♪ You caught me so young and insecure ♪ ♪ You knocked on my door ♪ ♪ And took me ♪ ♪ We packed our bags ♪ ♪ And we were gone ♪ ♪ If you could do it all... ♪ Straighten your leg there. ♪ Your perfect con ♪ ♪ Would you? ♪ ♪ If only I knew ♪ ♪ You didn't mean it ♪ ♪ I'd see your scheme ♪ ♪ I had a dream I believed in ♪ ♪ If only I knew ♪ ♪ You were a liar... ♪ Looser with your upper body.

Yes. We'll work you back into the corps tomorrow. Make sure you really get that line. - Yeah. - Okay, good job. Thank you. Oh, honey. Oh. Ah. I love you, darling. - Thank you very much. - See you tomorrow. - Yeah, see you tomorrow. - Okay. Great job today. Thank you. My star. Do you want to grab a bite to eat, and, uh, we can go over the rest of the show? Yeah, I'd love to. - Give me a few minutes? - Take your time. Okay. Hey, Barlow, it's me. About today. Can you, can you give me a call when you get a chance? Take you to lunch tomorrow. Bye. It was a good day, Charlie. Was it? Excuse me? W-Was that a good day for you? Sorry. Is there a problem here? You know there is. Why put on that ridiculous act with Barlow? Everyone knows the game you're playing. Hmm. Do you think this is a game for me? - She bared her soul out there for you today... - Mm. and you used it to humiliate her in front of everyone. Mm. Barlow's job was to interpret a character that I created, not to make her own personal soul-baring statement with my choreography. She crossed the line and I had to put her in check. Oh, and of course, you had nothing to do with crossing that line. Right, Zander? I could fire you. But you won't. Because you know I'm right. Don't push me. I mean it. I will do anything to protect my show. Do you understand? Choreographers can be... demanding and temperamental. Handling that kind of stress is just part of the job. So... What didn't Zander like about your dancing today? - Everything. - Well, give me an example. He said my leg was bent on the penché. Okay, show me. That's perfectly straight. What else? I was thinking about what I said to you the other night. I didn't mean that your career was... I know what you meant. Mom. I'm so proud of what you've accomplished. And you're an amazing teacher. I wouldn't be the dancer I am without you. Some artists are just destined for greatness. It can't be taught. You're strong and you're very talented. Prove yourself. Take whatever part Zander gives you and dance it better than anyone else. Okay. Work it. That's right. We're hot. Come on, Barlow, let me hear you. - No. - Aw, come on. Just say it. Shout it out. Okay. I'm hot! - I heard you. - Oh. Hi. - Hey. - What's going on? Oh, Zander's working with Kayla and the tech team, so we have a couple of hours before they need us. - Yes. - And I'm gonna steal Barlow for a sec. - Okay. - Let's get massive bagels. Love to. And here we are. Music store? - Are we buying something? - Uh, no. We are testing your musical skills. You mean playing an instrument? - I have no skills. - Uh, yes, you do. You just don't know it yet. Oh! How many fingers do you have? Kill it, Charlie! Look at those skills. Guitar solo. Come on! - Try this. - Oh. Ooh. Oh, yes. Okay. You're pretty good at this. Try this one. - How's that? - Good. And dip. - Oh, wow. - Wow. This is so pretty. - Hey, Charlie? - Yeah? - Thank you. - For what? You know what I mean. You made me laugh. Well, not on purpose. See? It was really nice. Exactly what I needed. I'm glad. Oh... That is Sammy. - They're ready for us. - Uh-oh. - Let's go. - Let's go. Watch out! Coming through! - Whoa! - Fast and fabulous! I'm maxed out in these heels. We're barely gonna make it at this point. I think we're gonna be fine. - It's gonna be... Oh! - Oh! - I gotta go. - I need him. We made it. Hey, can I ask you something? Sure. What exactly is going on between you and Zander? Nothing... lately. Really? Why? I was just thinking - maybe we could, um... - Barlow. Hey. Um, can you excuse us, please? Hi. Did you, um... Did you get my messages? Yes. You didn't... didn't return my calls. Y-You know, I... I can't get you out of my head. Everything I choreograph in there, it's... I visualize you dancing it. Is that supposed to make me feel better? No. It's just... I just... I want the show... I need the show to be so mind-blowingly brilliant. I want that, too. I know. Look, I know the whole Kayla thing went down really wrong, but I need your energy to make the show work. I need you to help me with her. Okay? Please tell me you're with me on this. Okay. - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay, everyone. The production team is in. We've got a lot of mechanics to get through before we get onto the stage, so, switch it on. Good. - The staircase in there. - We've got new wires, they're - practically invisible. - Let's clean this up. Pah! Whoosh. Uh, Charlie, take your cue off of Kayla. We're starting stage right. Cyc flies in at the second act. Good. Yeah. He's not doing it like that with me. Oh. Ooh. Guys, let's watch the spacing. No! Don't reach for her. Charlie, no. She's a muse. She's unattainable. - Kayla, please. - Yeah. Yeah, let's work in the understudy. - Emma, can you step in for Sidney? - Sure. - Hey. - There's gonna be fans built in to the risers here. - Ha, ha, ha. - We're gonna go for more kind of muted tones, - so monochromatic blues and greys. - It's very nice. No, no, no, stop! I-I feel like we need to change the music here. We could do this section using a prepared piano. This is so good, I could give you a flying head butt! I love it! Prepared piano is making a comeback. One! Two! Hi-yah! Barlow, can you please show them? She's phenomenal. I'm starting to see it. Yeah. Boom. A hard shaft of light slices down through on Kayla. - Sha, sha, suh. - Shuh. - Huh. - Can we go? Yeah. Yes, Kayla. Yes! Yes. Wow. Yeah. ♪ You know that I hold the controller ♪ ♪ Don't even start, better play your part... ♪ ...so hopefully, - you'll love it. - Well, I mean, I feel confident, but we'll just wait and see on Friday night. ♪ I've been on my job, I don't know what my... ♪ Aha! Found you - grazing the snack tray. - Oh. - Don't eat that. - All right. Oh, my God! - I told you. - What was that? I have no idea. - Okay, well, this looks safe. - Okay. Oh! Holy cow! My whole brain just shook. - Are you okay? - Did I chip it? You are... fine. - What? - Nothing. You just have really nice teeth. Excuse me. Can I have all the cast - for a group photo, please? - Sure. Thank you. - Nice teeth? - You, too. Yeah, sure. Fantastic! Yeah, stay like that. All right. - Yeah, right. - Now I'm gonna have the two leads. Could the rest of you clear the shot? Yeah. Slip away. Thank you. Perfect. Yeah, man. Perfect. Perfect. Look at each other. Face each other. Face each other. - Yeah! - Charlie looks like he's enjoying himself. - Fantastic! - So does Kayla. She'd eat him alive, though. But you can handle her, right? Well, I have to. Could have done a better job with you, though. Is that an apology? Zander, we need you. - Zander, where are you? - Yes, of course. This is to be continued. Come on, luv. Wow. You look fabulous. ♪ Maybe you forgot. ♪ Hey, what time do you guys want to head to the theatre today? I'm gonna go in early. I'll meet you guys there. Who am I sitting next to tonight? I snagged you a seat in the producer's section. - Ooh. - So, be cool. - I will. - Ugh. Ava, did you use all the hot water again? Maybe. - Hi, Mom. - Sweetheart, I just wanted to let you know that my sub just cancelled at the last minute, so I'm desperately trying to find someone to teach my master class tonight. - Oh. - It's too late to cancel it. It's okay. I really wanted to be there for - your opening night. - Don't worry, Mom. Really. You'll catch the next one. Are you sure? - Yes. - I know you'll be beautiful. Thank you. I love you. I love you, too. Your mom can't come? Hey. Don't worry. I'll be there, cheering you on. Oh. Get in, girls. Mm, love you guys. I have something for you. I recorded the music from "Free Dance." - Oh. - Play this at 8:00, and you'll be right there with me. Oh. Thank you. You're welcome. How does it feel? I don't know. Just humbling? I've always been the one sitting out there. Hoping and dreaming I could be up here. It's surreal, isn't it? It's so quiet now. But when those seats are filled and when the lights go down, there is that... that moment suspended in time. You know, the instant when a hush falls over the theater. And... it doesn't matter if you're in the audience, or on stage or crew in the wings. We're all here for the same thing. We're waiting for the magic to begin. Come in. Wow! Hello. - Hi, handsome. - How are you feeling? - Like I'm about to star on Broadway. - Hey. We need Kayla for a quick interview. Five minutes tops. It's important. Okay. I'm gonna hold you to that five, 'cause you need plenty of time to warm up. It's not like I've never done a show before. - I love her. - I've got this. I'll, uh... yeah, I'll see you out there. Okay. Can you put this right here? - Yes, of course. Looks great. - Thank you. I'm so nervous. Butterflies or nauseous? Butterflies. You're good, then. Oh. I got you guys something for opening night. Aw. So nice. Oh, my... They say good things come in threes. - This is perfect. - Oh. That is a great number. Oh. - Guys. - You guys are so cute. Okay, finish it now. Yeah. Good, good. - Hey! - Hey, man. - Everything good? - Absolutely. All right. Well, then, tear it up there tonight, guys. - Yeah. - Good. - All right, guys, I'll, uh, see you out there. - All right. I told you already, we got to move these flag cases and get 'em on stage. Is Kayla done with that interview yet? - I think it's still happening. - Oh, come on. Soussus. Yeah. And passé. It's always been a dream of mine. I am so excited to share the stage with such incredible dancers. - It's gonna be great. - Hey, guys. Sorry. We need Kayla right now. It's time for you to get your head in the show, okay? Go and get changed and get warmed up. - Okay? - Yeah. Big push up through, towards the barre. Can you get my skirt? Sure. This, miss. - Ravi! - Yeah, it was fantastic. Thank you. It's gonna be great. Thanks, Ravi. Thank you. Let's go. All ticket holders, left two doors, box office on the right. Over here, miss. Thank you. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine. I just need to shake it out. - Okay. - Oh. Mm. Okay, come on. - Are you all right? - Thanks. Thanks for coming. Thank you. - I'm so excited. - Edna. Is he the producer? - Yeah. - Thanks for all your help. Hi. I'm Ava. I'm an opera singer. Oh. That's nice. - What's this? - We've got a problem. - What is it? - It's her ankle. I'm fine. I just need to tape it up. I think I just... Can we get a medic over here, please? - Ow. - A medic! He's coming. - Hey. - Thank you. Can you deal with it? Can you take the shoe off? Okay, let me take a look at this. - Is everything all right? - It hurt when I do that? Guys, can we, uh, make our way on stage, please? - Thank you. - There's already some some swelling. Let's get ice on this right away. Should we get Barlow in on backup? Yeah, yeah, let's get the understudy ready to take Barlow's place in the corps. Barlow, can I talk to you for a minute? - Who has Barlow's dress? - It's right here. Great. Go. Go, go, go. - Crazy, right? - Yes. All right, Emma, those shoes are right there behind you. We are gonna have to pin your skirt. Thank you. Hi. Oksana? Oh, Ravi. Congratulations. How are your nerves? - I'm terrified. - Oh. Well, you shouldn't be. I hear that your dancers are phenomenal. Do you have a student in the show? My daughter... Barlow. You're kidding. I didn't know. - Is that okay? - Just make it tight. Hey. I'm ready to dance. I'm taped. What do you think? I wouldn't advise it. Hey, Kayla... What is she doing in my dress? - Relax, okay? - They're all here to see me perform tonight! Guys! Do I announce a change of cast? No! I'm dancing. What do I do? Do I dance my part in the corps? The understudy's already in place for you. Stop, okay? I'm calling it. Barlow, you're in for Kayla. - You can't do this to me! - Yes, I can, okay?
