What is it that I want to talk about? What is that you want to talk about? The thing that I want to talk about is that there is an elephant in the room. This is gonna sound terrible but this is only but my opinion. That's always worth a listen, right? Or maybe your thinking and my thinking is very similar. If we don't speak up about it, it continues to happen. - Habla. - Habla. - Habla. - Habla! Now. I grew up in Guatemala and in Guatemala... we are very homogenous, is that the word? And when I moved to New York, I just... I didn't know that I was gonna be expected to fit into a certain box. And the first time I got an inkling of it I was in a grocery store and somebody was: "Hey, how much is this?" And I was like: "Thank you for thinking that I would know that. I don't actually". And then I realized that there is a history about what you should be or a preconceived notion about what being Latino is... when you move to the States. So I had to come to terms with what it was and own it for myself. When I moved to the States, I felt like I had to blend in, right? That I... I think it's normal that you would try to separate yourself a little bit from what you were in order to become something else, right? People from Guatemala think you've changed and become Americanized and people from America think you're too Latin to be American so you're sort of in this in-between space but, when I twisted it on the positive I realized that when you're from somewhere else, right you have a very sort of objective perspective about the place where you're living. There's things that you can see because you didn't grow up there that you can find funny and you can pinpoint, right? Most people, no matter what the culture we have one thing in common, at least one and it's what we laugh at. When you try to explain to somebody who you are people put their guard up whenever it has to do with culture. But when somebody is laughing they relax, right and so the message is coming through while at the same time you're able to say something and that to me is the perfect blend of art and instruction. When you see somebody that doesn't look like you go through things that you can relate to. The next time that you see that person that doesn't look like you might not feel that they're that different, right? And I know it sounds optimistic and I know it sounds crazy, but that's... media is how we... interpret the world around us it's what tells us how we should feel about the world around us. So, if you see somebody on TV, on-screen and it's just sort of bringing you a positive feeling and a positive feedback then I believe slowly but surely you can start mending some of these wounds. It's a complete disservice to bridge-building when we generalize white people or people that aren't like us either, you know, I think that is sort of... I... to me it feels counterproductive, right? Like the more I make fun of people because they're different than me and then I expect them not to do the same to me is just sort of hypocritical sometimes. You can point out things that you find funny about other people as long as you can take it yourself. Like, for, example, if I'm at a party and people are like: "Oh my God, you're from Guatemala? I just came back from Venezuela. I mean, what?" And... I get it, I get it what they are doing, they're trying to relate. I'm sure Venezuela is dope, I've never been, you know? But I do find that sometimes people wanna pressure you into being like: but, who do you hate? And: who are you... And I just... I don't act from that point. I don't act from a place of hatred. A lot of people, people that have helped me in my life have been all shapes and colors and all walks of life, and religious and sexual orientations and they've all been incredibly human and kind to me. But we tend to think that people from certain states or from certain areas are gonna be close-minded but I have found that what there is is just a lack of information. I feel that you fear what you don't know, right? And if all you've seen of us, Latinos, has been, you know getting shot at by Antonio Banderas, you know, in El Zorro... Then I understand why you'd be afraid of us. The more that I've travelled the more I see that there is this genuine curiosity when it's face to face. You realize that we have way more in common, way more in common. You have way more in common with immigrants than you do with rich people trying to pull us apart. You don't have to give up a part of your identity in order to form a new one. You can be fully one thing and fully another. I feel fully... like a New Yorker, man. My blood, sweat and tears is all over those streets. That's the city that made my dreams come true. But I also feel fully Guatemalteco, man, fully. O sea, I can't be more Guatemalteco if I had like a quetzal on my shoulder. I swear to God. "Hell, yeah, man! I'm Guatemalteco and I'm a New Yorker. And I'm here to represent both." And I think it's no longer como vende patria (homeland betrayal) sort of oh, you know, you're ashamed to be us. No, I think I love this 200% because it's like "I could represent all of us, man. This new generation is all of us, is ours." There is this huge community and this huge history this very proud history of being Latino in the States and once you tap into that once you realize that you can be two things at once you can assimilate into American culture while not losing your identity... that's when really my life took off. And it' still taking off. I mean, look, I mean I have a white background and there's a camera in front of me. I mean... the dream. Truly the dream. My mom and dad are really cool people. My father is really like very conservative almost like, you would say, a right-wing Republican and my mother is completely to the left. They would be very loud and opinionated in our house but never allow that outside of our house because they thought that wasn't the place for us in this country. But it was interesting because as much as we had these incredibly feisty conversations like so many immigrants that are lost in translation in English they sounded dumb. They were both so well-spoken and educated and in English they seemed uneducated. And it was the paradox of that that I grew up with. Thinking all these people don't get that my parents are really smart and cool and yet they're so afraid. What are they afraid of? I think no one talks about in this country, the history of people that are not black or white. And we don't talk about where Latinos come from, or where Asians come from. Most of the time we come from countries that if we were to speak up we would all disappear. We even have a name for that in Latin America. Los desaparecidos (the disappeared). And your family would never see you again. So your parents tell you, "Please, be quiet. Don't be a revolutionary, please!" Because they are so afraid something is gonna happen to you. So there's a lack of understanding between all of us of where we all come from of what is our pain, what is our back story why do we behave the way we behave that sounds and looks irrational. You just see in the news that we come here for economic reasons but so many of us have come to this country as political refugees from either left-wing dictatorships or right-wing dictatorships. And so many of my African-American friends say to me. What's up with you Latinos? Why are you so quiet? How can all this stuff be going on in this country and none of you speak up. I don't think you realize the trauma we all have when we come to this country. And we have to have this understanding between all multicultural people because together we are everything and apart we are nothing. Multicultural women, and particularly African-Americans and Latinas are the number one consumer in the country. So we are the number-one voters and the number-one purchasers. All the power is in our hands. We are the number-one emerging market in the world. That means we make more money for everybody than anybody else. Without us there is no economy. If we do not buy from a company for one month that company would go under. And that is a great power. And unless we understand each other and we understand each other's pain and we know why we behave the way we behave and we help each other find a voice, we're not gonna make it. This is a country built on voices. On authentic voices, on people standing-up for their rights. And even with all the bad things that we might see happening no one has the ability to speak-up to argue to say "this is wrong" the way we have in this country. Finding your voice for some people is a lifetime journey. And it is, I think, the greatest journey of your life. My name is Diana Danelys de Los Santos. I was in a girl group called Amara. Unfortunately, the group fell apart. One of them fell in love, the other girl got pregnant and there was just too much drama amongst us. So, I decided to keep the name Amara and I continued pursuing my career. "La Negra" (the black one) it was 'cause nobody would remember my name And it stayed Amara La Negra. It's racial profiling Hold up. and I'm proud of that. So I was like, if you don't like it, Amara La Negra, that's my name. I started in SÃ¡bado Gigante (Giant Saturday), as a child star I was there for six years every Saturday. I grew up in the entertainment industry. and the hair stylist said, he actually told my mom "You have to do something with her hair because her hair is unmanageable and we don't have time for this." Are we not good enough? Am I not beautiful enough? Is my hair not the stereotype, the prototype of society's standard of beauty? What's the problem? Colorism and racial issues happen among Latinos as well. I'm sorry, it's not amongst just African-Americans and Caucasians. We can be very racist against one another, and it's the truth. You know how many experiences I've had with where they say "Oh, you know, for being black you're very pretty." Like, excuse me? Excuse me! I'm black too! So, what are you telling me? Are you basically telling me to self-hate myself? What's the problem? I just feel like there's a brainwash that has happened from generation to generation and if we don't do anything to stop it we're going back! we're going back. This is gonna sound terrible but this is only but my opinion. I feel that we consistently are trying to see what nationality is better than the other what race is better than the other. we create ourselves these divisions amongst ourselves. If we don't see each other as equals we are never gonna be able to grow we're never gonna be able to be empowered. why don't we all come together and help and support? And with everything that's happening instead of all of us coming together and just being supportive that's their problem. We're good. And it shouldn't be like that. The change is using your voice. Standing up to the thing that you know is wrong. There's many ways you can protest without having to be violent. Me standing here alone and talking to you is making a difference, is making a change. I'm making you aware of the fact that there is a problem. I want to know that I will be remembered for doing something great. I don't take all my, you know, bags, I don't take cars, I'm not gonna take jewelry the day that I die. What I will take is the difference I made in the world for others. So, what are you gonna do about it? 'Cause I'm doing something about it. So when I was a little boy I wanted to be a cop. I got inspired in first grade because the girl who sat next to me her father was a cop and he came into our Show and Tell and he was, you know, very Protect and Serve and community mentality and he reminded me of my dad. So that's why I wanted to be a cop but unfortunately and fortunately it wasn't in the cards for me. You know, I lived in Burbank at the time and I would always stare up at the Warner Brothers water tower there with the big Warner Brothers logo but it was something that you know, somebody like me really didn't think I could be a part of because I didn't really have any friends in the business I didn't know anybody that could support me, or help me or even let me know that I could be in the entertainment business. So at about 21 or 22 years old I started working at Warner Brothers at Gate 2 right there, at the main entrance. From there I got the opportunity to be the security officer or security guard, on the set of Stage 24 at Warner Brothers which was the hit TV show Friends. Then I did five years as an executive assistant for Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. And then I got a job working for Tyler Perry as an assistant. I did that for about a year, a year and a half and then at that point he promoted me from assistant which was the lowest person so to speak, in his organization at the time to the President of the company and that happened in about a 45-second meeting. I did about 13 years working for Tyler and then last year I said to him I wanted to go out on my own buy his former studio and now I own a Areu Brother studios here in Atlanta, Georgia. So as I was inspired as a little boy to be a cop because I saw somebody who looked like me and my family once I started working at a major studio and people thought "Wow! Ozzie is working at Warner Brothers? Maybe I can get a job there. Maybe I could be an actor. Maybe I could be a security officer. Maybe I can get into a union job there." Even though I was just doing security hey, I got my foot in the door, and look got my foot in the door there I was given a hand up by other different celebrities that believed in me because they cared about me and they saw something in me and now me and my organization we want to celebrate others and give them that hand up as well. The type of stories we're gonna do is we're getting behind Latinos Latino stories, females, female stories, minorities in general. And not only in front of the camera but behind the camera but we want our entire company to be as diverse as possible. We want the projects that we see to be as diverse as the world that we live in. I want the audiences to really get behind stories that are authentic and storytellers that are authentic because I think that audience really has the power right now in the world that we live in. My dream would be that in 10 or 15 years nobody is even using those two words, inclusion and diversity because we've made such great strides and the impact has been felt that, you know, the industry is on to something else. I came to this country with my family in the late '90s. As many immigrants, we settled in New York fled poverty to seek a better life in the United States. And little did I know that my experience as an undocumented immigrant, with my family was gonna shape so much of what I do today and who I am today. When you're undocumented in this country you're walking everyday with fear fear that you could be deported and separated from your family fear when you're driving because the police stops you because of the way that you look. Fear that employers would abuse you and exploit you and not pay you back because they know that they can use the threat of deportation to exploit your labor. Why was this happening in the country that is supposed to be the country of opportunity and of justice and the pursuit of happiness? So, I had this big dream of being the first person in my family to go to college. And I'm in my 11th grade, and my guidance counselor tells me "because you're undocumented, you cannot go to school." My entire world just shattered. So I remember going back home and I was crying and my mom, you know, put her arms on her waist and she said "Cristina, we are not giving up. You're gonna go back to that school and you're gonna tell that counselor that you're going to college." And I found the courage in myself to go and I realized then that what my mother was teaching me was to fight for my dreams. And that was my beginning to organizing other young immigrants like myself bringing us together, finding our voice. We train young people about knowing your rights about knowing how to advocate for ourselves and our communities and to protect one another. This is the country of opportunity, the pursuit of happiness where you can accomplish your dreams. And then you find yourself here facing all these challenges but because you believe in these values so much and you sacrificed so much to be here you almost do everything so that this country actually lives up to those values. We have to believe that, in this country we are worthy of dignity of a life where we are thriving, where we are reaching are dreams. But that won't happen unless we take action. We have to be in leadership roles and be part of that decision-making process because we know what it feels like as a comunidad (community) to be misrepresented for our lives and our experiences to be misunderstood. We have to be in those rooms and part of those tables where decisions about our lives and that impact our lives, are being made whether that is in business, in politics, in government in entertainment. Nothing about us should be without us. A lot of people say we're gonna be the majority in the near future or part of that majority but numbers are not destiny. So we have to vote, we have to participate in our democracy run for office lead companies, create our own businesses write our stories. Because that's when things are gonna change. When I was 15 years old myself and 20 other young people from across the country came together to file a lawsuit against the Federal government of the United States. The basis of our case is that the United States government has violated our constitutional rights to life liberty and property for actively perpetuating the climate crisis. It is not just an environmental problem it is affecting our economics, it is affecting our politics it is affecting our access to education our access to clean water. We are saying that the government is responsible for the harm that our generation is experiencing, that it needs to be held accountable. We are demanding that a climate recovery plan be put in place immediately to remedy the damages that we are already experiencing and to prevent further impacts. And the people that are already experiencing the worse impacts of this and will continue to experience the worse impacts of this are oftentimes black, brown and poor communities underrepresented, underserved communities. That part of me that is Mexicano, that is also my indigenous part our responsibility as people, as Mexica people, as native people is to preserve and protect our community, our land, our water. Colonial constructs that came with the colonization of this continent have taught us to view ourselves as inherently separate from the earth and Nature is something to conquer and dominate and have power over rather to respect and to see as an integral part of our existence. We are disconnected from how we treat the earth which gives us life every day. We are fundamentally removed I think, at a large scale from everything around us. One of the poems that I learned, a piece of a poem that I learned it was passed down to me from my elders, says (Nauahth language) "At the least we have left flowers, at the least we have left songs". Even though a time for our civilization and our nations will come to an end the beauty of our culture is in the flowers, is in the songs that we preserve for the next generations. And now, more than ever, we need you we need to work together to stand up and fight back, and play our part. Going vegan is not going to stop the climate crisis. But understanding the connection of what is on our plate to the world around us can help frame our understanding of the world in a different way that gives us compassion and a moral ground from where to do larger work like organizing our communities. It's the same thing with the water we use with the plastic that we consume. I can give you a list of different things and different actions you can take in your life or how to connect with your community or how to organize and mobilize but at the foundation of all of that is you understanding that you have a voice that the world needs to hear. Your voice is no less important than mine. Power comes in many forms. Leadership comes in many forms. It's in our artwork; it's in how we communicate. It's in our poetry, in our music, in our language. It's in the love that we put into the food that we make. So, whether you are an artist, or an author, or a storyteller or whether you are selling tamales en la esquina (at the corner) regardless of how you interact with the world and with your community you have a place in shaping the future. We owe it to every person who has already lost their lives who has already lost their homes to rising sea levels to changing weather patterns we owe it to them, you know? To keep fighting until it's absolutely too late. And at this moment is not too late. Boom! La BorinqueÃ±a is an Afro Puerto Rican super hero. She is an environmental champion, fighting for environmental justice. Her powers are drawn from the feminist energy that historically is a part of Puerto Rico. The TaÃ­nos, the indigenous people of Puerto Rico they believed in a supreme being, a mother goddess, Atavex. And she introduces la BorinqueÃ±a to her twin sons YucahÃº and HuracÃ¡n. YucahÃº, the spirit of the seas and the land. HuracÃ¡n the spirit of the elements and hurricanes. I mean, the actual word "hurricane" literally comes from Puerto Rico 'cause the Tainos said huracÃ¡n. And these elements are part of Puerto Rico's original mythology. The original name of the island was Borinquen "land of the noble valiant creator." She's La BorinqueÃ±a, the living spirit the living embodiment of this powerful energy in history that has always been a part of Puerto Rico. But believe it or not has been hidden. Most comic books are based on either Greek, Roman mythology, Norse mythologies. We love superheroes and they've been around for over a century but these characters by and large are white male narratives. They don't look like us, they don't sound like us. When was the last time you heard of a super hero eating sancocho (stew)? I wanted to create a super hero that really worked on the true history because it was embroiled in some sort of wicked mystery and I wanted to unveil all of that. One of the most important things to do when you are trying to suppress a people often times is, you destroy their history. When empires take over nations one of the first places they go to are the libraries they destroy the archives, they destroy the art. Do we know what our history is in this nation? What our contributions have been to this nation? Because when we understand them, then we know and respect and expect others to acknowledge our place in our nation. We have to learn who we are before we know where we are going. What we tried to do with La BorinqueÃ±a is not only to reintroduce people to that lost history but teach people to embrace it because by embracing it you find that superpower that was always there, all along. And one of the most important superpowers that the character has is to show the world what our family is because she is incredibly connected to her mother and father but also to her abuelo (grandpa) and abuela (grandma) in Puerto Rico because that is at the core what our superpower is beyond the pages of a comic book. She is a hero that is connected to a real place a real people, a real history. As a kid, my mom always used to say that all I wanted was a curtain to jump from behind. I love performing and communicating, and growing up in Venezuela a country that crumbled because of polarization and because the increasingly authoritarian government started curtailing independent media. I remember when I was growing up there, going to college that I said I want to be a journalist and I wanna speak truth and I wanna tell the kinds of stories that I'm seeing are not being put out here. I went out to protest as a college student. We were tear gassed, they opened up the water cannons on us and I realized I wasn't gonna be able to do the kind of journalism I dreamed of in my home country. So I packed my bags and I came to the beacon of freedom, the United States. I really made an effort to be... be solid as a journalist and put information out there that was fact. I believe in getting on the ground and talking to the actual people who are affected. I obviously am a firm believer in the power of words so we have to be mindful as Latinos about everything we put out there. And that is just not only on us who are on television or writing newspapers or radio it's on every single one of you guys at home who are twitting and re-twitting and posting and re-posting especially if you have a growing community on social media. Latinos, you know, we're very chismosos (gossipy) we're faranduleros (we like tabloid press) for better or worse we consume news, entertainment, information and we put it out there in two languages. So what I wanna tell you guys is to be responsible with every single piece of information you put out there especially with outlets like Facebook. Now it can determine national elections. Like, that's how big the influence is. We need transparency; we need fact checking especially in today's world, especially for the next generation. Every news outlet you follow, every single post on Facebook where's the information coming from? Is the source trustworthy? What was the date that they put out this viral video or image? What is the motive behind the information that was put out there and what kind of ripple effects can it create? And I think as Latinos we have to be more supportive of content that is about our community because as a journalist I can sit in the newsroom and push to cover stories about Latinos but if I don't get your clicks then my bosses are not gonna support those stories. So you have el poder del click, the power of the click so hold yourself accountable and believe in the power of words. The nation's Hispanic population numbers 60 million people. To put that in perspective, that's 18% of the nation's population. And it's also one of the fastest-growing groups in the country. Since 2000, in fact alone half of the population growth for the United States has come from the nation's Latino population. When it comes to the Hispanic identity questions like are Spaniards Hispanic or Latino in the United States? What about Brazilians? What about people from Belize? Latino identity in the United States is really all about somebody choosing to say that they are of this background. It's about self-identity. That means people have to claim it and have to say that they are Latino to be counted as a Latino. Of course, that means that there may be some people who have this background might even have a surname that is a Latino surname and yet they may not self identify as Hispanic or Latino. It also means that you might have some celebrities who are of a particular background for example a Spanish background, like Antonio Banderas but questions about whether or not he would count as Hispanic or Latino really come down to how he self-identifies himself. So, when you think about Hispanic identity it's all about how you choose to call yourself. Not all Latinos are immigrants only about a third of the nation's Latino population were born in another country. Not all Latino immigrants are undocumented immigrants. The majority hold US citizenship. And the nation's Hispanic population growth is being driven by births here in the United States as opposed to the arrival of new immigrants. Not all Latinos live in California, Texas, Florida and New York many live in other parts of the country including Montana, North Dakota and Alaska. Among the nation's 60 million Latinos there are a number of interesting characteristics. Fewer than half, for example, identify as Catholic. The numbers that are rising, however are people who have no religious affiliation even though many of them will also say that they have for example, an image of the Virgin Mary in their home. So it's interesting that you have this combination of people who are not religious-affiliated but also have religious icons in their home which reflect Latino culture. Not all Latinos speak Spanish. While the majority do a growing segment of hispanics today speak only English. It's likely without a future infusion of immigrants from Latin America that we will continue to see English-only use rise among this population. Some of the big changes that have happened within the Latino population in the last few years have been around education. Today, the number of Latinos who drop out of high school is at about 15%. That's down sharply since the 1990s when almost half of Latinos had dropped out of high school. A record number of young Latinos attend college today more than three million. And that number's been rising sharply since 2009. Many Hispanics also marry somebody who's not Hispanic. In fact, one of the nation's highest intermarriage rates is among Latinos. About one in four Hispanics marry somebody who's not Hispanic and, in fact, the single largest group of intermarried couples are white and Hispanic spouse together. The nation's population is projected to get older. By 2065, about one quarter of the nation's population will be age of 65 or older. But the nation's Hispanic population is much younger and, in fact, accounts for most of the growth in the workforce today and that will continue to be the case into the future. As we look forward, Latinos will play a big role in shaping the workforce in the United States and also providing the support for those who retire in the future. Youth is a big driver of just about everything about this population. And I think that's interesting because all other major racial and ethnic groups in the United States are much older and, as a result, a lot of what's to come in terms of labor market participation in terms of voting, in terms of so many other characteristics are gonna be driven by the nation's Latino youth. My name is Laurie Hernandez and I'm an Olympic gymnast. I won a gold for the teen finals and a silver for the individual balance beam. A really big challenge growing up was not seeing any gymnast during my era that looked like me and trying to pick apart athletes from the crowd or athletes that had curly hair like I did and identifying with that and going "okay, she's my favorite 'cause she kind of looks like me". But it was tough knowing that I would have to pave the way for myself. So my parents are both Puerto Rican, they were born in New York. My grandparents were born in Puerto Rico and it was wonderful growing up I mean especially during the holidays we valued having our family together, and having music blasting and my mom cooking, and me trying to help her make sofrito which I still don't know how to do because she's the best, and she's mom. I think hundred percent Puerto Rican about the way I was raised was coming home from practice and having rice and beans always cooked every night, for a decade. A decade. A decade! We had pasta sometimes but if it wasn't pasta it was rice and beans. And chicken. My dad loves music, that's my biggest tie into being who I am today. I love music and a big part of that is because of him. They would sometimes try to teach me how to dance salsa and my mom... she would always go, like, "One, two, three, five, six, seven" and... And she would do it and I would try to mimic it and it'd never look like her doing it. It wasn't choreographed they just felt it I don't know it's almost like as soon as you're born "boom!" you know how to count Marc Anthony's songs. I don't... I don't make the rules! My family welcomes us staying at home. They don't want us to move out, they don't want us to go anywhere. There's a lot of love in that and a lot of love in setting us free and letting us do our own thing and knowing that if something goes wrong or if we are feeling off if we just want we always have the choice to come back home and that's wherever your people are. Our whole family sacrifice to help me get to the team it wasn't just me sacrificing stuff, it was everybody. And I also remember, you know, at some point it was like okay, we gotta start eating a little healthier 'cause we have all these meets coming up and we want to make sure that my body is staying healthy and the right way to do that is to eat the right way and so my mom didn't want me to do that on my own and my whole family... my whole family agreed to go on a health kick and we took everything out of the fridge we took everything out of the cabinets and everybody started to eat healthy with me. I couldn't have done what I didn't 2016 without my community of people without my family, and without my parents. After Rio, I didn't realize how much of a big deal it was to a lot of people you know, been Puerto Rican and been Latina and not speaking Spanish. It was almost like a disowning approach about it which was tough because there's a lot of Latinas, a lot of Hispanics out there who don't speak Spanish but that doesn't take away who you are on the inside. I own very much that I am Puerto Rican. I still have my curls I still have my skin and I still have my family tree that solidifies that. So it's letting other people know like you are still who you are if you don't know the language it doesn't devalue you as a person. Our culture and our family is still something that's being learned by a lot of people and trying to be understood and a lot of times when we are afraid and we don't understand things that we want to put it in a box and contain it because we are afraid or because we don't know enough about it. When in reality every family out there can not fit in a box that's not how life works. You don't get to pick what culture does what and who goes where. Everybody is different and it just happens that my family loves music and we love cooking, and we love being together that might not be the same for somebody else but there's something about... being different and coming to a place that is supposed to accept differences and being yourself. If you can be yourself freely that's so beautiful 'cause then we truly would have a melting pot, you know. So I grew up in a house that there was really no bigotry. grew up in a house where there I could have any kind of friends whatever the gender was, whatever the race was whatever the ethnicity it was, whatever the color was. Believe me, my household had issues but those were not issues. In my family, because they're from the mountains I always say I'm a high-class jÃ­bara. And that's literally what I am. Even though we were dealing with a lot of stuff we were dealing with poverty we were dealing with social issues, all of that I guess my family realized we didn't have time for that. We were struggling with surviving with, like, getting a job, with getting out of the hood. The world that we came from was trying to help each other get somewhere in life and not worry about what color boyfriend you brought home or, you know, what friend that was gay or not. There was too many other things that we were dealing with than to deal with bigotry. I went to five different schools by the time I was 10 years old because we were always looking for cheaper rent, cheaper rent. They didn't really care about education. It was like property, get a job, property. That was like back then. They just wanted people to do well because they came from nothing. I'm the oldest of five. There's three boys and my sister. And I remember my mother pulling me aside one day and saying I think Kenny is gay. And I thought "Yeah, I think he is gay." And that was it. It was not just a big deal. And I remember that we would ask him all the time which now looking back is like crazy that we were doing this to, like, a young kid "Kenny, are you gay? Kenny, are you gay?" I mean, it was something that, it was easy for us to ask because we knew that we had no issue with it. He came to live with me when he was 17 years old because he wanted to go to fashion school. And he started talking to me about how he was dating a girl. And I was like, "wait, I'm so confused. You're dating a girl right now?" And finally, I just said to him, "Kenny, are you gay? Because if you... you have to tell me the truth. You cannot live in my home and not be honest with me." And he put his head back on the sofa and he is like, "I don't know. I don't know. I'm so confused." And he wasn't confused, what he was was scared. He would hear homophobic slurs from his friends. He would hear that kind of stuff. Even though the household was full of love and it didn't matter he heard it outside. You know things like that. Are they gonna be like, you know, doing that very famous like this. That's very Latina. You don't think anybody's looking. You're like... Who would feel comfortable coming out? How can we do that to our own family and our own community? I have no tolerance for intolerance. I don't wanna hear all of the things that make you have a hang-up about it. I don't care. I'm not the one to have a conversation with you. I cannot be articulate and I cannot be diplomatic. It's wrong. And I have no problem saying what I feel, how I feel, when I feel because if we don't speak up about it it continues to happen. If we go, "Ay bueno, (oh well) that's the way he is, or whatever, then no! Then nothing changes. We're supposed to all be on this together and work towards a better world and not do it amongst ourselves. So it's all... Or anybody. It doesn't matter what community you're coming from. You have to say something whether they're gonna change or not you have to say something. 'cause, otherwise, you're complicit in the situation. When I look at my brother, who still lives with me, by the way and thank God, because I don't want him to leave. He's 30 years old now. I'm like, "Don't leave, don't leave me." When I think about him, and I think about how incredible he is I just can't imagine when people do that to each other. Everyone should be able to be themselves and what they're doing to these kids is heartbreaking. Being out on the streets, because you're gay. Being homeless, because you're gay. More than anything, I don't look at my brother as a gay person; I look at my brother as a person. It's not like what does your brother, who's gay, bring into your life? What does my amazing brother who is this amazing man bring into my life regardless of his sexuality? That's what it is for me. Let's talk about family... first. When you tell your parents that you're gay they're sort of already educated on the topic. People talk about gay issues a lot more, like in the media like with same sex marriage, equality, and all these things. But when you're trans I feel like it's a different story. When you're not who I need you to be, you're gonna get cut off. And I won't show you love. I won't continue to raise you. I won't continue to give you the pride and pass on the culture that you're entitled to. Sometimes you just wanna run home and cry to your mom and tell her, like, this is what I'm going through, what do I do? Because it's that trust, esa confianza you cannot find that in the street. It's that kind of love that you need that nurtures your soul that you cannot find anywhere else. And trust me, I've looked, okay? Well, I got lucky because my family gave me a chance. My mom sort of doesn't have a choice 'cause she's stuck with me for life, okay? But, you know, it was my uncles, it was my cousins it was, you know, people. What? You know, people freak out. My family came around, of course. My family embraces me for who I am today. I feel stronger, you know? Like, even if my cousins were to joke with me. Like, just, whatever, cracking jokes, I can joke back and not be hurt. I would say the most important part of my transition is being embraced as a woman in my family and learning how to cook and learning how to provide that sort of love and healing within the home, as a woman. My mom began embracing me and teaching me how to be a woman of the world and sort of re-raising me. It was a validation that I finally received that I was like, wow, you know, like if anyone in the world has anything to say about me it doesn't matter because my mother is noticing that she's raising a woman that's a reflection of her. And when she started to sort of teach me these things it was like magic, like I sort of felt magic inside. And, you know, that poured over to my grandma, to my aunt, to my sister. And I was at my grandma's and she was teaching me you know, how to cook the right lomo saltado how to make, you know, papa a la huancaÃ­na the right way, with the right sauce 'cause if you mess up the sauce you mess up the whole thing. And so, to be taught this and to be embraced in that way was powerful. It was life-changing. And it's a shift that happens that's not a physical thing it's not on the outside, it's only on the inside. I believe that all LGBT people have something that's a little bit different whether you want to describe it as two-spirit or fluid... non-binary. And I truly do believe that we have this gift to understand the male side and the female side in a way that we can help the rest of the world. I think LGBT people are here to unite the masses and to really unite the divine masculine and the divine feminine. Some of us live with both already. We're here for that reason for the whole world, I think. LGBT people make a lot of decisions based out of not being prepared and sometimes those decisions are, like, put your life in danger. It's a sad thing to see that happen when all it just takes is a little bit of love. My parents were hard-working people. They had one to two, to three jobs at a time. My parents were big, big salsa dancers. I mean, salsa music was a huge part of me growing up. Every Sunday we had this big mirror, right, this big, big mirror... in our living room. And, so, every Sunday my dad would put on salsa and we would dance, and would dance. And he would say, "Keep your head up. Never look at the floor. Keep your head up." And then my mom would enter and they would dance and they were the most beautiful couple I've ever seen dancing. That's how they met, you know? They met salsa dancing. And I guess that's how I was made. We were this kind of family. And then we were just not. My family was separated through deportation and I was left behind. I was 14 years old. I guess the reason why they didn't pay attention to me or didn't take me with my parents was because I am a U.S. citizen. They never came to check on me or anything so I kind of just slipped through the cracks as many children of undocumented people do. The people who came to the rescue were my best friend Grisel and her mother Ana. I was hiding under the bed, waiting for them, holding a phone. They took me out of under the bed. They held me. I cried. And then my father called. Then I had to go visit them in jail. And that was hard too. I didn't understand why my parents were considered criminals. I was lucky that my parents were separated from me when I was 14 because maybe I was able to take it a little better. I can't even imagine a 10-month old, or a five-year old, or a 10-year old. Kids start to create this narrative in their heads to survive to be able to survive you have to say "Okay, now I have to be built of armor." If I tell myself that I'm worth nothing then it'll hurt a lot less than the world telling me that I'm worth nothing. Some of those kids that were in cages... and when they're reunited with their families I saw them being so angry. And they didn't wanna hug their parents. They didn't wanna be near their parents. And I know for a fact that that child every day that they were in that cage were longing and praying to see their parents. I blamed my parents just like those children did theirs. I blamed them for not having their life together for letting that happen to me. How dared they... how dared they let them take them away? Wasn't I special? Wasn't I lovable? Didn't I matter? Somehow it's your fault. This must be my fault, because it doesn't make any sense. How do you take a child's parents from them? Because they don't have the right paperwork? You're going to destroy an entire family because they don't have the appropriate paperwork? I know that this trauma last for a lifetime. It's damaging beyond repair. And it can be repaired, but it takes a lot. And we don't have those kinds of resources. I mean, certainly the community I grew in didn't have those kinds of resources. Certainly the health care system that we have in this country doesn't have those kinds of resources especially for kids of immigrants. This is causing and will cause generational trauma. It's not only affecting the children now but it's gonna affect their children, and their children's children. It's not just happening to our community. But it is disproportionately happening to our community. We're gonna see more poverty, we're gonna see more depression we're gonna see more suicides we're gonna see more family separations. And not just through deportation but also through incarceration. So these are all the things that are gonna plague that already plague our community and will be plaguing our community for years and years and years to come. The good thing about... growing up with the parents that I did have was that they did teach me a lot about love and how to be vulnerable. And I think that really, really took me far when I was asking for help when I was humbling myself because I was scared or confused. And so I had a beautiful, beautiful community that lent their hand, and their homes and their money and their food to a kid like me that was in need. My school was fantastic. I went to a performance arts school. I don't think I would have been able to survive if I didn't have the arts. That's why I'm such a big advocate of the arts. We make sure that our communities are safe by electing people that are going to fight for our rights and our interests. If we're not involved, then we say "Oh, well, no one cares about us anyway" then we're never gonna get anywhere. I know it's difficult to believe in a democratic system that usually doesn't really speak to our people but that's why we need to do everything that we can to be involved and part of it because we are a part of it. Part of me sharing my story has been so that I can selfishly unburden myself with it, right? It has helped me understand a lot of what's going on. It has helped me understand myself. It has helped me love myself and not blame myself anymore. Or my parents. Even though it hurts me to share my story over and over again I want everyone to know what community I came from. 'Cause I think my community is beautiful. The immigrant community is beautiful the Latino community is beautiful. I come from there. Maybe one of the most important moments in my life was not feeding somebody but watching my wife feeding my daughter for the first time. It's a very fascinating, beautiful moment when you are able to feed somebody. I am a cook, I feed the few but in the process I have the power and the knowledge to feed the many. Why not use that power to feed the many? So we show up and we create the systems with whatever we find to feed as many people in need as we can reach. A lot of people are giving me probably more credit than I deserve with the things that World Central Kitchen has done because it's never been about "I, the person" it's been about "We, the people". The army of people that we have, doing what we do, is amazing. In Puerto Rico alone was more than 25,000 Puerto Ricans. When everybody forgot about Puerto Rico when the Federal Government forgot about Puerto Rico the people of Puerto Rico fed Puerto Rico. Bahamians fed Bahamas. That's what World Central Kitchen does. I don't do it. I'm only one more piece of the puzzle. But together it's a very powerful one. I'm tired of seeing food as the problem. We need to start seeing food as the solution. Food is immigration. Food is national security. Food is health care. Food is the economy. Food is job creation. Food is peace, so we don't have to fight wars. Food is at the heart of solutions all across the planet. And we have too many leaders that are used leading with telling others what to do without them showing us what to do. And I think we need more leaders that they are the ones moving ahead and say, "Follow me!" That's the type of leadership we need today. I cannot just be in the comfort of my home and tell people: "You! Go to Haiti and feed the hungry!" No, I need to be there with them saying "Follow me! Let's feed the hungry together!" Less leaders that go to the big places and the big organizations that they give speeches and where everybody starts clapping. We need to stop giving so many speeches. I should stop talking right now and leave this interview and go to feed the hungry. Less speeches and more doing, more action. Obviously for me in kitchens I arrived to America more than 27 years ago. The people in those kitchens, yes, the vast majority we were immigrants. Unfortunately, in America we have this situation where immigrants, many times voiceless because they are what some people call "illegals" while I call undocumented they are part of the system but somehow the system doesn't recognize that they are here. Sure people are coming through the borders because America needs the people coming through the borders because without those people coming through the borders our factories and our farms and our golf courses they would not be functioning. If you are a farmer and you need hundred employees nobody shows up to work on the farm. And actually they don't give you visas to bring farmers from other countries. How they get them? Because they let them come in. What we need to change is the system, we are using those people. So our Congressmen and Senators can eat their salad on the work of the shoulders of the undocumented that actually no Democrats, no Republicans want to give the citizenship or the Green Card to belong to the American Dream. Yes, you can be a Republican. Yes, you can be a Democrat. But what you cannot be is against undocumented immigrants because actually is not their fault. It's the fault of their system. And who is in charge of that system? Our Congressmen, our Senators, and our President. We need to be asking them to fix the system so those people are treated with respect and they are part of the American Dream. I think we are in a moment in History that we need to weaponize empathy we need to weaponize goodness. If we have consciousness of how powerful we are and we all come together under one flag, one flag of goodness everything is possible. Translator: IYUNO
