Well. Hasn't anybody got anything to say? We were waiting to hear what you had to say, father. Stop mumbling. - I said .. What do you think of Atterbury's survey? You said nothing of the sort. If you want my opinion, I think it's fiddle-faddle. What do you think, Junior? I concur with you, grandfather. You are always right. No-one is always right. Will that boy ever grow up? Wire Ivor Nassau in Hollywood immediately. That the house of Pettypacker accepts his offer of five million dollars .. For The Colossal Film Company. Before he recovers consciousness. And thank Atterbury for his survey. And tell him of our decision. I am honored by your invitation to address my alma mater. In the past however I've encountered difficulty in persuading my heroes .. That the science of mathematics is not of mere figures and geometrical design. 3 o'clock, Mr Dodd. One minute past. You are late. But science is more important to life than food and drink. Science .. That account should have been out last night. Without which there could be no music, no poetry, no art. This balance, Mr Dodd. There is an error in the addition. The total should be 1 million 2 hundred and 96 thousand, 3 hundred and 21. The flight of the bird .. Have the adding machine fixed. The leap of the salmon. The rhythm of the dance .. All are mathematical. Good afternoon. - Atterbury. Grandpa. All of us wish to thank you for your survey. It proves my point. It would be ridiculous to sell Colossal. But .. But what? We .. we have decided to take Mr Nassau's offer. Is your grandfather still in the boardroom? Yes. But Atterbury, don't you see ..? I see a stubborn disregard for my conclusions, Mr Pettypacker. But I see more than that. I see 30,202 stockholders .. Who don't get the protection to which they're entitled. And just how would you go about helping them? I'd go to Hollywood. I'd examine the company's records, discover the error and correct it. It sounds simple, Atterbury. But here we are dealing with human factors. In matters of business one is forced to ignore human factors. You are smart. But you are young. I'm old but I'm still pretty smart. Atterbury. Do you realize those are real folks you see acting things out on the screen? Yeah. It's like this. One fellow writes a story. Another fellow directs it. A lot of different temperaments. That's the way motion pictures are made, Atterbury. I know. I've looked into it. Two and two make four, Mr Pettypacker. Whether they be fish, apples or human beings. You are a pig-headed young man, Atterbury. You mistake confidence with stubbornness Mr Pettypacker. Confidence based on mathematics. A science which has never failed. And never will fail. I'll stake my future on it. Good day, sir. - Wait. You stake your future. We're staking five million dollars. I beg your pardon, Mr Pettypacker. You're staking nothing of the sort. You're selling a 10 million dollar property for 5 million. Because it suffers problems. You are deliberately giving away five millions of your stockholders' money. Atterbury, how dare you .. - Shut up! Shut up. In 72 years of banking, Atterbury. No-one has ever said a thing like that to me before. It's your judgement against mine now. So, you go to Hollywood. You will be in full charge. With unlimited authority. But if you fail. Don't come back. I'll go to Hollywood. Have that vulcanised, Junior. Yes, grandfather. Hello spectators. This is Rush Hughes, your Hollywood photographer. Hello, hello and hello. Atterbury Dodd. New York financial wizard is due in today. "To doctor the ailing Colossal Studio but .." "And this is the low-down. Colossal is not sick." "It is dying from slow poison." "My guess is, it's an inside job engineered by an outside chiseller." "With the aid of which fading, feminine super sexed star?" "And what cheese director with a phony foreign accent?" Phooey. "Picture. A strange Hollywood .." I don't like it. Too much talk. Don't give it a thought, Mr Nasser. I'll take care of Mr Atterbury Dodd. And what's the first thing I do? I break his glasses so he can't read the books. Then during the days I put him on a merry-go-round. And of an evening Cheri here can give him the neon treatment. That is unless the old grey mare ain't what she used to be. Potts. You should play Gone With The Wind. But for good you should be gone. Ah, save them cracks for your pictures. So, you see Mr Nassau by the time I put Atterbury Dodd through .. Just a minute, Potts. Do you know who you are dealing with? Dodd is the most brilliant financial brain. That has been developed in Wall Street in the last ten years. Why, he is .. Hey. The third race is on. "And here they come down the stretch." "Boy, what a race. Pom-Pom has cut the lead down to half a length." "And there it is, folks. Almost a photographic finish." "Lady Ethel is the winner, Pom-Pom second and Witchcraft third." "Now in just a moment .." And this is the point, Potts. And you too might listen. I'll tell it as simply as I can. Who knows, you might get it. We are trying to put over a pretty fast deal. It's conceivable that the sheer novelty of your drivel may daze him. For a short time. - He might bore him to death. Yeah. But your job is tougher. Dodd doesn't drink or smoke and doesn't go with girls. That don't have to worry Thelma none. Even without his specs Dodd can see she ain't no ing?nue. The whole set up makes me sick. You're as bad an actress as often as you're good. You know this deal means a great deal to both of us. Now I get mine the day Colossal closes. And you get yours. A five year contract with the studio that absorbs colossal. That isn't bad for a star who's been on a down way for two years. She will do as I shall say so. You're the masterful type, huh? Mr Quintain is outside, Mr Nassau. I'm not in. He knows that Miss Cheri and Mr Koslofski are here. Well, I ain't here. Now listen both of you. And concentrate hard. Quintain knows more about the picture business than any of us. We've fooled them so far because this is not picture business. It's hijacking. Ah, the genius of Colossal. Quintain, glad to see you. - You're a liar. Nice going, Curly. Listen, you've a picture to finish or maybe it slipped your mind? I cannot shoot without a mandate. - Don't give me that. From the start this picture smelled to heaven. First, it was writers. Dozens of them. Then your cameraman. You shoot five weeks with a guy that's been photographing you since 1898. And because he can't squirt the elixir of youth from his lens .. You start with a new boy. - Doug, you know .. I know you've put a million bucks extra on the picture. Naturally, New York got a yen to know what's the matter. Well get this. I'm not taking the slap for it. You are the producer, aren't you? He's just your director. - What have you got to do with this? Or have you? Say listen, chiseller. If I felt you had your slimy paws on this .. Ah, cool off. Pour yourself a drink. Doug, you don't expect me to play a love scene I don't feel. Love scenes the way you feel them? Look, Camille. They've got censors or maybe you haven't heard. Now listen, baby. Why don't you quit this racket? You are poison at the box office. Finish the picture and give up gracefully. Koslofski, you directed a good picture once. Why don't you prove it was no accident? - I do not argue with peasants. So it's like that, eh? Okay. Get it up off there and shoot your love scene. Smell up the joint good but close the picture. That's it. You forget that my contract gives me a pool of cast, direction, cutting .. You're telling me about your contract? I'm the cluck that gave it to you. Sure. Everybody in Hollywood knows it. To a dame I was in love with. And so help me, I'm still in love with. Doug, please. Oh Doug. No, you're not going to start that again. One drink and you're a lush. - So what? You're washed up. Just a guy who jumped into a gin bottle and pulled the cork in after him. - Ha! Alright, go ahead! Ruin your life. My life. But this time you bail yourself out. A charming domestic scene. Mr Quintain. You will please do me the courtesy of not making love to my fianc?e. In my presence. Listen, Slug. I loved your fianc?e long before they turned over a stone and you crawled out. Come on, Mac. May I get your autograph please? - Yes, my chickadee. Mickey. Hey, Mickey! You're a life saver. Take the body home before it collapses, will you. Oh, my feet are killing me. You don't mind, do you? You are going my way. You don't have to stand this, mister. Oh, Mickey. Drive on please. Well, you don't know how grateful I am. Coming or going? Arriving. Are you an actress? I'm a stand-in for Thelma Cheri. Pardon my enquiring but would you mind telling me .. Who is Thelma Cheri? And what is a stand-in? I'd go without pie for a week if Thelma could hear you say that. But you do know what a star is don't you? Well, vaguely yes. Why, how you must get around. Well, Thelma Cheri is a star, and like most stars she's a pretty fragile type. She mustn't be fatigued or mussed. And above all she must never be so vulgar as to perspire. Hence the stand-in does the sweating for her. I see. Sorry, but I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about. Look, you wouldn't expect a star to endure the heat of the lights .. While they're setting up the cameras and microphones. No, I suppose not. - No. So they dig up a girl, me, to stand in for her while all this torture goes on. Oh, yes? Then when everything is set the star, cool and immaculate .. Puts her dainty little feet in the chalk marks. And the stand-in worn and wilted, fades out of the picture .. And business goes on as usual. I see. Yes. Hey sonny-boy, who are you anyway to rate this car? My name is Dodd. Atterbury Dodd. Oh, I'm Lester Plum. How do you do. - How do you do. Are you in the picture business? As a matter of fact I'm a kind of stand-in too, for my bank. You see I'm out here to take temporary charge of Colossal Studios. Mister, with your encyclopaedic knowledge of the picture business .. You ought to be terrific. That certainly rounds out my existence. Life can hold but one more moment for me. Indeed? - Yeah. I'm going to make Shirley Temple president of a bank. So you're the new boss of Colossal, huh? Tell me, are you a doer or a don't-er? - I beg your pardon? The don't-ers are the guys that got Hollywood. They have beaucoup fun but they don't do much. It's the doers that wreck the works. They barge in and fire everybody. My dear young woman, I am a businessman. Naturally there are some aspects peculiar to this business. It's my plan to find out about them. Ah, a finder-outer. Now we're getting someplace. An orderly mind Miss Plum, does not attempt to arrive at a total .. Until it has assimilated a complete list of the items involved. Yeah, but most finder-outers get their lists of items from the screwer-uppers. The .. screwer-uppers? Hey Mickey, here is the homestead. You're a lamb sonny-boy. But .. don't let them lead you to the slaughter. So long. Hey sonny-boy, wait a minute! Hey! We are very proud of this suite, Mr Dodd. Two bedrooms. One in orchid, and the other in pale fudge. And the bath, a dramatic jungle red. Tell me, how much does all this bad taste cost? Two hundred dollars a day. But I shouldn't worry. It is charged to Colossal. Well Doddsy old son, sorry I lost you at the station. Get a load of the space. You can't grab more if you were a trunk murder victim. Hey, some hideaway you got here, you dog. Make it snappy. My tongue is hanging out. Here you are. Charge it to Colossal. That's the picture business for you, Doddsy. Doddsy, the girls here are up for some sport tonight. Girls, meet Mr Dodd. - How do you do. Hi. Doddsy here is the first guy I ever met that never made a crack about my name. What is your name? - Potts. And I got a window. Now look Doddsy, here is the menu for tonight. First we attack the Trocadero. Get your autograph book filled just like that. Mr Potts. I appreciate your friends breaking numerous engagements for me but .. I'm here on business. Mr Dodd. You are Mr Dodd, ain't you? - Yes. I read you were coming here to run Colossal. And I made up my mind I was going to see you. I've been here six months. And I haven't been able to get in to a studio. Elvira, this is Mr Dodd who can give you a contract. There's not a child in Hollywood who can do the things that my Elvira can do. Now swing it, child. "Is it true what they say .." "About Dixie?" "Does the sun really shine all the time?" Elvira sure can go to town, can't she. Elvira, do that Mae West number. Don't you think Elvira has done enough? That's up to you, Mr Dodd. Now tell me honestly, what do you think? I will tell you quite honestly, madam. I think this little girl should be out in the sunshine playing with her dolls. Instead of being forced to give a revolting exhibition like this. No wonder you can't get in to any of the studios. Do you know what you're doing? You are robbing your daughter of her childhood. So will you please leave. Or will I have to send for the juvenile authorities? Attaboy, Atterbury. Get it? "Attaboy Atterbury"? Will you excuse me. I'm not feeling very well. Ah .. a shot of bicarb will fix that. How do you do. - How do you do, sir. Could I speak to Miss Lester Plum please? Step right in my son and I'll tell her. Thank you. Won't you be seated. Oh, they've decided on somebody else? Extra work? But I starred in that picture in the silent days. There must be some little part. Lester is making herself decent. I see. Well thanks anyway. What news from the battlefront, Naomi? They offered me Extra work. - Don't take it, Naomi. Fight it out on this line if it takes all summer. That's what I'm doing. And with the battle of Gettysburg scheduled for a remake .. They will have to come to me. And I'm ready for them. Four score and seven years ago. Our fathers brought forth upon this continent. A new nation. Conceived in liberty. And dedicated to the .. Uh .. to the .. to the .. Proposition that all men are created equal. And now we're engages. In a great war. A great civil war. For seven years I have waited for this part. I would have sworn that I was ready. But now I .. Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth .. Sonny-boy. Miss Plum. You forgot this. - Oh, thank you. I could have stopped at the hotel for it. You would not have found me there. Come on over and sit down, huh? Thank you. Miss Plum. Tell me. There must be some place a man can live without being tricked and tormented .. By people who want to do his thinking for him. Not when you're a big-shot. That's the picture business. Tommy. Hello. - How'd it go, kid? Oh, I didn't do it. - Oh. Gee Lester, it was a tough stunt. Look, I'll show you. You see, Blake and me are supposed to be fencing at the top of the palace steps. Then he gives it to me. And they wanted me to do that for seven and a half bucks. Can you imagine that? I don't blame you, Tommy. It's worth fifteen bucks if it's worth a cent. But he just did it for nothing. - I got my pride haven't I? Besides, that's the picture business. With that, I feel like kind of a heel owing the old lady so much back rent. Gosh, if I was sure I'd crack a couple of ribs or something I'd have done it. Eighteen bucks a week in hospital expenses isn't so bad. But it would have been just my luck not even to get hurt. Miss Plum. Goodbye. I'm sorry to have burdened you. Wait. If you don't mind sharing the bathtub with a tame seal, we've a vacancy here. Here? - Sure. It's the last place in the world they would ever expect to find you. And if you're on the level about that finder-outer business .. These folks here know all the answers. They're down and out. But the only difference between them and the people on top. Is that the others have jobs now. Miss Plum. I will send for my things. And as for that .. trained seal. I'm sure he can't be half as obnoxious as a certain Mr Potts. Precisely what I want. Are you sure the hams won't get you down? Hams, failures and has-beens. They don't seem to have got you down, Miss Plum. - Me? I hid the list of who's through in Hollywood. Come here and I'll show you. Oh. I forget to tell you we're neighbours. Any objections? I see no reason why that should affect the situation. You're right. It wouldn't. Here it is. Let's sit down over here. Would you think that's me? No. Oh. Such is fame. When that picture was taken I was getting $4,000 a week. $4,000 a week? - Uhuh. I was the Shirley Temple of my day. I've heard that name several times today, Miss Plum. Who is Miss Temple? Skip it. - Well, it's not important. Tell me, Miss Plum. What is your present remuneration? Well if you mean wages, I make forty dollars a week. When working. That's entirely wrong, Miss Plum. - You're telling me. I mean the ratio of four thousand to forty. An inventory taken today .. Would show that you had the same assets that you had as a child. Your mind is mature. Above average, if I may say so. - You may. Please don't interrupt, Miss Plum. - Okay teach. Yes. Physically, you are stronger. Potentially .. If you were worth $4,000 a week then you should be worth $8,000 a week now. It's simple mathematics. There must be some element .. - I'll say there is an element. Hey .. do you like chocolate? Chocolate, Miss Plum? Yes. Okay then. Maybe Joe Public likes vanilla. Vanilla? Look. [ Singing ] "On the good ship lollipop." "It's a sweet trip to a candy shop." "When the bob-bons play." "On the sunny beach at peppermint bay." "Lemonade stands fill the air." "Crackerjack bands everywhere." "And there you are .." "Happy landing on a chocolate .." "Bar." You like it? It's horrible, Miss Plum. - Sure. But when I was small it was awful cute. - But Miss Plum. The point is sonny-boy that I now dish raspberry and Joe Public likes vanilla. I see. I'm not squawking because of old age. I still have my social security number. Hey. You'll be needing a secretary and I've got the answer. Come here. Look. My night-school diploma. Read it and gasp. "Maxima cum laude." That's Greek for "with highest honors". I'm afraid that is Latin, Miss Plum. And as a matter of fact I've usually had a male secretary. Well I'll try to keep my voice and my emotions in a low register. Lester. You know the rules of the house. Mrs Mack, I was about to call you. I am showing Mister .. Mister Atterbury the next room. The rent is twelve a week. I don't allow cooking in the rooms, drinking on the premises. And I expect my guests to be ladies and gentlemen all the time. And one more thing. No pets. Silvernose belongs to my husband. He's the only trained seal in pictures. He gets more fan-mail that Clark Gable. Who ..? - Skip it. For the moment, Miss Plum, I thought .. That's the Admiral. I told Mr Atterbury about Silvernose. Yes, I'm sure we won't get in each other's way, Mrs ..? Yes. Excuse me. Could you direct me to Mr Quintain's office? Got a pass? - Why no. I don't care if you're a tax collector. Nobody gets through here without a pass. I see. Is that the usual procedure? No, this is the usual procedure. It is a pleasure to see such a competent man in a position of trust. Who shall I tell him is calling? - Mr Dodd. Mr Atterbury Dodd? - Yes. I am so sorry. I should have known. Why? You've never seen me before. Sit down, Mr Dodd. - Mr Quintain. Before we discuss business. Let me say I would consider it an impertinence if you ask me to carouse .. Drink, or go to parties. May I ask what prompts this? Your Mr Potts seems under the impression that I'm given to riotous living. I don't want you to make that mistake. I'm neither a libertine nor a charlatan. I'm here for one purpose only. To ascertain why it is that Colossal is losing money instead of making it. You may count on my complete co-operation, Mr Dodd. Yes, I expect that. - You must check the books immediately? Well it seems to me that if I were to inspect the factory .. Equip myself with a complete knowledge of the intricacies of picture making. I could approach the books more intelligently tomorrow. Mr Dodd, I've been in the business of making pictures for 20 years .. And there is still several intricacies that I haven't figured out myself yet. Look .. I'll give you a rough idea. See, here is the administration building. Fire and police departments, sound stages, commissary, recording room. Most interesting, Mr Quintain. Within these walls, 3,000 units. Just to manufacture motion pictures. Units? Carpenters, electricians, artisans of all sorts. Cogs in the machine. They are not cogs and they are not units, Mr Dodd. They are people. Human beings. For purposes of bookkeeping Mr Quintain, I prefer to regard them as units. You peddle this joint to Nassau and your units will be on the dole. Your logic escapes me. Well every time an independent studio becomes important .. Nassau is the heel who puts them out of business. He's a stock juggler. Makes his money out of closing studios, not operating them. That's a very startling piece of information, Mr Quintain. He'll buy this joint just like he did Excelsior and National. In fifteen minutes it will be a ghost town. This way, Mr Dodd. Alright. We can go in now. Now hit her on the back of the head with that spot. Make it snappy will you. I'm roasting. Bring up that baby and break its neck. Kill the junior. Get in position. Heads up. Doddsy old socks! I'm glad to see you. Come here, I want to get a picture of you. For publicity, understand. Right. Here you are, now. Just point at the dames. Get it? Why do I point at these young ladies? Hold it! Great, because a banker finds talent in a snow banks. Get it? Banker. Snow bank? Come on, kids. Let's go. Now let's see the blizzard. Kill it. Have you seen enough? Quite. Well come along. I'll have you meet Miss Cheri. Thelma. - Yeah? Thelma, this is Mr Atterbury Dodd. Miss Cheri. Oh, how do you do, Mr Dodd. And Mr Koslofski, Mr Dodd. It's a pleasure. Quite. Mr Dodd, won't you sit down. Thank you. All lined up, chief. Excuse me. I'll catch you outside. I've arranged a little surprise party in your honor. I just know you'll love it. Miss Cheri, I shan't. I don't like parties. I don't know what to say to people. I just sit in corners. And wish I might go home. - That's exactly how I feel. But of course, you're in a position to do as you please, while I .. I am a slave really. To the millions of people who depend on me. To bring cheer into their drab lives. Well, excuse me. Oh, forgive me. You shouldn't be an executive. No. No indeed. Look in that mirror. You have such fine chiselled features. All set, Miss Cheri. Better hurry or your stand-in will fry. Well, let her fry. I think I shall insist upon you for my leading man. Miss Cheri. At times I find it hard to differentiate between facetiousness and sincerity. But if you are not joking. My duties here would prevent any such project. Even if I could permit myself to be exhibited in the films. But stranger things than that have happened in Hollywood. Why, even I was a cigarette girl in a nightclub in Dallas once. Would you believe that? Oh yes. Excuse me. Has he lost something? No .. he is looking for camera angles. What is this? - Leave it alone. Edelweiss, Chief. It's what the script calls for. Mr Dodd. You see with your own eyes what is up against the creator. Is this edelweiss? I'm not a botanist but it looks like edelweiss. Ah. It looks like edelweiss but it is not edelweiss. It is paper. Get real edelweiss. - But chief .. We'd have to send to Switzerland. I'll wait. What should I do, Mr Quintain? Well, I think this is something for the head of the company to decide. In as much as there is a blizzard raging during the scene. Will anyone see the edelweiss? Mr Dodd. In Russia. When I make my great passage from the cradle to the grave. I had a real cradle and a real grave. Now they want me to shoot paper flowers. Thelma, tell him. I think Mr Dodd is perfectly right. How easily your trained mind cuts through the obvious conclusion. Alright. Let's see your trained mind .. Cut through and bring this picture to an obvious conclusion. Shall we? - Let us proceed. Okay, Miss Cheri. Alright. Roll 'em. Give me the effect. Treadmill. Clouds. Snow bank. Freeze. Hey, Mr Dodd. Oh, how do you do, Miss Plum. That's up to you. Do I get a job or do I have to pin my faith on the Townsend plan? It's the last shot in the picture, you know. I'll keep you in mind. - Yeah. I'll see to that. Hey listen, sonny-boy. Don't let them take you over the hard jumps. Huh? See the thing I was riding on? It's like a merry-go-round. It goes like mad and never gets you anywhere. I fail to understand. So did Napoleon. Look what happened at Waterloo. The blizzard. Ski! Oh Miss Plum. - Quiet! Paper edelweiss. Tell me when it's over. Cut! Colossal Studio. Good evening. I'm sorry Miss Cheri. Mr Dodd is still not accepting any calls. I will. You are welcome. Colossal Studio. Good evening. 280,000 dollars for story costs on Sex And Satan. Fantastic. Can you tell me why one story has to be written to many times? That's the picture business. That's the picture business? Hasn't anybody any answer for stupidity except "that's the picture business"? I'm sorry Mr Todd but .. That's the only answer. Hey, sonny-boy. Why, Miss Plum. You remember me? The girl you mentioned a job to? I couldn't get you by phone and you have not been near the house .. so here I am. Come in, Miss Plum. - Thank you. I'm sorry, sir. Quite alright, Mr Glover. Don't apologise. You can go home now. And thanks very much. Thank you, sir. Miss Plum, close both doors. My my, you talk like a producer. But I can scream so you can hear through more closed doors than this. Can you? Oh yes. Have a seat, Miss Plum. I wish to think aloud. And I find that I can do so more efficiently in the form of conversation. I've made a cursory investigation and frankly, I'm appalled. Appalled? Maybe you appal easily? Koslofski. Real edelweiss. Thelma Cheri. Eleven writers. Potts. Mr Dodd, before you trust me too far, don't you think it would be safer if .. I were your secretary instead of a stray you found on your doorstep? Quite true, Miss Plum. But I warn you. I require someone who cannot be corrupted. And who will be absolutely faithful to me. Sonny-boy, most men like women that are faithful but who corrupt easily. Miss Plum. As employer and employee, I feel that .. A certain formality in our relationship. Oh, you mean during business hours I'm to call you Mr Dodd? If you will, Miss Plum. Okay sonny-boy, uh Mr Dodd. Thank you. I have a confidential telegram to get off immediately. I warn you, accuracy and speed will be the vital factors .. Affecting your permanent employment. Pettypacker and Sons, Wall Street. New York City. "Gentlemen." "Am delaying report re: financial structure Colossal." "Until special production." "Quote: Sex and Satan." "Unquote." "Can be viewed and judged." "As to potential value." "Stop." Miss Plum. Yes, Mr Dodd? Would you mind sitting over here? - No. Of course not. Now, Miss Plum. Let us assume that you are dictating and I am the secretary. You will observe that I am not doing this. Nor this. Nor am I doing .. this. Instead, I am doing .. This. Yes, Mr Dodd? Yes, Mr Dodd. Let us start again from the beginning shall we. Why should we start at the beginning? Why don't we pick it up where we left off? Miss Plum, this is no time for levity. - Isn't this what you said? Pettypacker and Sons, Wall Street. New York. Gentlemen. I am delaying report re: financial structure Colossal. Until production. Quote: "Sex and Satan". Unquote. Can be viewed and judged as to potential value. Stop. A truly remarkable feat of memory, Miss Plum. Oh, you forget I was a kid star. Shirley Temple could have memorised that dull little speech of yours backwards. Of course, I will take it down shorthand if you want but you must slow down. Yeah. What did I say last? "Judged as to potential value. Stop." Exactly. "The success or failure of this production." "Will vitally influence." "My ultimate decision." "Re: sale of Colossal to Nassau." "Stop." "Happy birthday to you." "Happy birthday to you." "Happy birthday dear Grandpa." "Happy birthday to you." What's going on? Happy birthday, father. What's happy about it? Now, Fowler. I say, what's happy about it? Looks like a forest fire. If that fellow. Atterbury Dodd is the cause of my losing five million dollars. I will .. What's that for? I'm going to get you a hunk of something you haven't had for days. Fresh air. I've got the jitters. There is nothing the matter with my nerves. Sonny-boy. Mr Dodd, I mean. You forget I work with you daytime and sleep in the room next to you at night. And I haven't done much sleeping lately as you've been doing my treadmill act. Actually, I am disturbed. The time for you to be disturbed is tomorrow .. When the picture is stuck together and you get a first horrified look at it. Miss Plum, this is a crisis. The savings of 30,000 stockholders. The integrity of my bank. And incidentally, my own career. All hang on the success or failure of Sex and Satan. Now do you wonder that .. - Plenty. I wonder if you have any normal male instincts. Do you mind if we talk about me for a minute? No, not at all. Did you ever notice anything about my hair? Your hair, Miss Plum? - Yes. Feel it. It's very soft. And the wave is as natural as the crease in a flivver fender. And the color is rich and real and utterly feminine. The implication escapes me. Okay, One strike. Strike? Wait. Look at my eyes. Do you notice anything? There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with them so far as I can see. If I can rely on the voice of the mob. My eyes are of unusual depth and color and they are very large and wide apart. Many is the extra boy who's been willing to give up his title for those eyes. Well? What you say is no doubt true, Miss Plum. But .. Okay .. two strikes. But you got to toss me one more. Mr Dodd. I .. scarcely know how to approach this but .. Well I mean .. haven't you noticed anything about me at all? Why yes I have, Miss Plum. I am intrigued by .. your mind. And I must confess. - Strike three. I'm out. I must confess I've studied your personal appearance. Quite exhaustively. - Oh, you've got me there. Tell me. Did your studies reveal any faint traces of beauty? Well, you must be rather beautiful, Miss Plum. Otherwise the impulse to observe you would never have occurred to me. Oh, you are capable of great restraint in your admiration. Dear Miss Plum, this is a business day. - Alright, so it's a business day. That means you must stay here and worry yourself sick? You'll be dead tomorrow. Meanwhile, you and I will have some fun. - Miss Plum! Look. Maybe you're going to fire me for saying this but I've got to because .. Well, because I've just got to. You know your trouble? You've figures in your blood instead of red corpuscles. You're a scratch entry in the human race. Goodness gracious. - I can prove it. Ever hit a man? - No. - Ever love a woman? - Never. Got drunk and thrown out on your ear? - Certainly not. Were you ever wicked or wanted to be wicked? - Never. Ever had any fun at all? - I haven't had time. Well, we're going to have some fun tonight! Oh, I'm sorry. I just couldn't help it. Miss Plum. Please don't go away. Miss Plum. You've shown me a picture of myself. That is not pleasant to behold. I seem to have led an odd kind existence. I've been unaware of life as it went on around me. But I was contented. And I didn't want to be disturbed in my contentment. I seem to have been left a long way behind. Then you'd better start catching up. I agree. What are you going to do about it? In the future I shall not tether my emotions. I shall give life an opportunity. To make me the kind of person I might have been. Miss Plum .. do you dance? Yes, of course. - Good. [ Dance music ] Well, come on. Don't you know how? - No. If you will just do it by yourself first. Do you mind if I use a stand-in? Stop. Stay right there, Miss Plum. On the fourth beat, your foot was .. Here. On the third. Here. Oh, you can't learn to dance by mathematics. It's rhythm. Rhythm is based on mathematics, Miss Plum. Hold it. Hey, this is Lester. I won't be home for dinner. No. And Mrs Mack. Don't hold dinner for Mr Atterbury either. No .. goodbye. One. Two. Three. Four. One. Two. Three. Four. I wouldn't have believed it if I'd seen it with my own eyes. One. Two. Where do you plan on going tonight? - Four. One. I've decided to take your advice, Miss Plum. Three, four. I'm going out dancing. One, two. With Miss Cheri. You'd better take the rug with you. You, you vacuum you. Why, Miss Plum. One, two, three, four. You tango divinely, Mr Dodd. Thanks very much. If only this could go on for ever. Instead of just a sweet glimpse. A glimpse of what? The kind of a glimpse a girl like me gets .. When her orbit crosses the orbit of a man like you. For one great moment. I beg your pardon. Excuse me. Do you ever dream, Mr Dodd? Not habitually. Two, three, four. Occasionally, when I have something to eat which disagrees with me. Four. You just won't be serious will you, Mr Dodd. A tango? Let's slay them, dearie. With a rumba. Hey. I beg your pardon, madame. You are wanted on the telephone. Pardon me. I will only be a moment. And remember. The next dance is mine. Well, Dodd. How do you like Hollywood? I've been so busy. That's the trouble. You big fellows don't know how to relax. You try to repair in a day .. The accumulated damages of years of bad management. Now. Take Colossal for instance. Yes, that is precisely what I am trying to prevent. Oh? That's very good, Dodd. Now that you mention it. I know things about that situation that you do not know. Exactly. For example, you know why Colossal is worth five million dollars to you. While the Pettypackers consider it worthless to their stockholders. You make is sound lie a conspiracy against the stockholder. The thought was yours, not mine. And, Mr Nassau. If you are contemplating trying to intimidate .. Cajole or otherwise .. Swerve me from my purpose here. - Listen Dodd, you've got lots to learn. But you are alright. Yes, sir. You are alright. Thank you, Mr Nassau. But honey, I can't leave. It's in Dodd's honor. Alright. Alright. Pick me up when you're through. But make it early, will you babe. Honey, how does the picture look? - I haven't seen a foot of it. Well let's not talk about the picture. I don't want to fight with you tonight you beautiful .. Say, how soon do we get a look at this cheesecake? I'm piecing it together as fast as I can. Take a look at this. 300 feet of Cheri's pan. It stops the action dead. But if I cut an inch of it, she'll get me fired. Mr Dodd, how do you occupy your leisure? Miss Cheri, all the excitement, the romance, the adventure that I want .. I find in my own way. Your own way? Well, if you must know. In the science of mathematics. How fascinating. How dull. How deadly dull, Mr Dodd. That's a perfectly normal reaction, Mr Koslofski. Because you don't know the science of mathematics. It is more important to life than meat and drink. Without it there could be no music, no art, no music, no poetry. The flight of the bird. The leap of the salmon. The rhythm of the .. The .. The .. The flight of the bird. The leap of the salmon. The .. The rhythm of the dance. It's a lie! Are you calling me maybe crook? I'm calling you nothing. But your possession of these articles .. Requires some explanation. Now please Mr Dodd, he didn't know what he was doing. Consider the incident closed. Now wait, Mr Dodd. Now please don't go. Please, for my sake, don't go. - Doddsy, the party is in your honor. Don't you think I've been honored sufficiently for one evening? Goodnight. [ Laughter ] Take the rhythm of the salmon and the leap of the dance. You take it, I can't. Hiya, baby. Give us some music over there. One, two, three, four. And a one, and a two. What big eyes you got, Miss Cheri. And a three and a four. [ Crying sounds ] [ Crying sounds ] Miss Plum. What's the matter, Miss Plum? Miss Plum, open the door. I insist. Well, what do you want? I heard sounds of distress. - Oh, your eye. What happened? - I .. I fell. I know. After somebody punched you. Let's see it. You look like a bad embalming job. Who hit you? - Koslofski. Did you slug him back? - No, I .. What are you anyway? A mouse or a man? Miss Plum, if a man can't control himself, how can he control others? Besides, I .. Don't know much about the art of self-defence. Well, you could have done this. Why Miss Plum, you're .. You're wonderful. I don't see anything wonderful about it. Just plain Jujitsu. A trick of leverage. Leverage? The principle of Archimedes. The Greek mathematician. I don't know about that. I know it's handy when a guy driving you home tries to shift gear with your knee. Miss Plum. Teach me how to do that. I taught you how to do the tango and look what happened. By the way. How did you make out with that female Casanova? Miss Plum, I must insist that you grant Miss Cheri the respect that .. The respect to which she is entitled? Is that it? Protecting her against me, huh? And now you want me to teach you Jujitsu? If you don't mind, Miss Plum. - It will be a pleasure. Oh, you're hurt. - No, no. No. Oh, you are hurt. No, Miss Plum. It is just my eyes. Unfortunately, without glasses I suffer from multiple visions. Now, let me see. Let me do it to you. Now let me see. First of all, I .. I pull this down. Then I .. Then I do this. Then I hold you close. Closer. - I beg your pardon? Closer. As close as you can. Oh yes. Now what shall I do? Don't you know? Of course. Now I apply the leverage. I've mastered it. Without striking a blow, I can render a person helpless. Miss Plum? Oh, my dear Miss Plum. You are hurt. Let me rub it for you. Where are you hurt? Not where you're rubbing will do it any good, sonny-boy. Oh, Mr Dodd. Lester told us who you are. About you being the head of Colossal, that is. You know, Silvernose's contract with Monarch expires next week. He's a buy at three and a half. Goodbye. Little. Jungle Goddess. Sir Jaffrey. My beloved. I see. Snow. The edelweiss. Congo. He's dead. But I shall keep our tryst. St. Moritz. In. October. Miss Plum. Would you mind telling me how the picture left you? Numb .. just numb. If you want me, I'll .. I'll be in St. Moritz. In October. Mr Dodd. Since last night I am filled with remorse. What a strange thing. That was social. This is business. I accept. Miss Cheri, are you satisfied with the production? Well Mr Dodd, an artist is never satisfied. There are always little things that must be done over again. Then you don't consider the production finished? Mr Dodd .. great pictures are not made. They are remade. That's the picture business, Mr Dodd. Mr Quintain. What would you advise? It's a turkey. I'd advise you not to spend another dime on it. Better to junk it and forget it. I told these two from the beginning it was a dud. You drunken pig. Mr Dodd. All through the production, he was like this .. I was what? Thelma. Tell Mr Dodd the truth of what I am saying. Well, why don't you answer? Alright, I will. It's true. I begged him all through the production to stay sober and to help us. We might have avoided retakes if .. if .. Have you anything to say, Mr Quintain? You heard what the lady said. Mr Quintain. Your intoxication at a time when the success of Colossal .. Depended on this picture. Is unpardonable. You place me in a most unpleasant position. But this is so unnecessary. There is no alternative. Mr Dodd. You just took sole charge of a studio. Oh, Miss Plum. I recall you knew a method by which we might gauge the merits of Sex and Satan. My first guess is, you mean a preview? An advance showing at which cards are passed among the spectators. Upon which they note their reactions. Sure. Try it on the dog. If he doesn't bite you, you're in. Precisely. You hate me, don't you. Go on, say it. I deserve it. I deserve every rotten thing you can say to me. But Doug, if you only knew what staying on top means to me. I do now. - I must have been crazy. But .. seeing everything crack up. Everything I'd hocked my soul to get, Doug. I was afraid. - You hocked your soul? Look. I dragged you from behind a cigarette tray and put you up on a billboard. The chump that shoved you down an unsuspecting public's throat. Made you a big star in this business. Until they got wise that your hips were doing the acting and not your face. When you thought you were slipping, you got engaged to that termite Koslofski. Because you figured he could do more for you than I could. Even that didn't cure me. Koslofski was a bust, so you came crawling back to me. Promising me anything if I gave you another chance. And I fell for it. But the whole thing is so rotten it makes me retch. But it's not your fault, girly. It's mine. Yeah, mine. I put a small-town dame in a spot where a million fans treated her like royalty. I made you an applause addict. I had no right to expect you to kick over a habit like that. Doug, please. I can't stand it. I know exactly how you feel, babe. For months I've stood still for every dirty rap you've wanted to hang on me. Conning myself for what a guy I am. Ducking a real, honest look at my kisser until today you made me look. You know they've got a name for guys who peddle shopworn merchandise to suckers. Oh Doug. I won't hear you say those things about yourself. Everybody else is saying them. Why rule me out? I ought to take poison but it'd give you too much publicity. I've a better way. No Doug, no. I'm not worth it. I've done enough to you already. You won't get another job again if you start drinking. You'll end up in a straitjacket. - Why not? You can get better that way. No, Doug. Doug! What about me? - You? Next time, rattle before you strike. What actor or actress do you like the most? The gorilla. Did you like the story? - What story? 215 cards and all of them liked the gorilla more than your girlfriend. Miss Plum. The lady to whom you refer as my "girlfriend". Is merely a business associate. When they hissed your business associate I felt the theater was full of cobras. Yes, it was a horrible experience. Well, don't take it too hard, sonny-boy. Miss Plum. I am afraid this is the end of Colossal. Do you mean you are going to sell? To Nassau? I see no alternative. Atterbury, do you know what you're saying? Why, Miss Plum. Your sympathetic attitude proves to me that you are not only a loyal employee. You are also .. If you will permit the liberty. A close personal friend. The prospect of humbling myself before the Pettypackers .. Why, you egotistical adding machine. What do I care how you humbled yourself? I'm thinking of the people who go out on their ear if you close this studio. Pop Jones at the commissary. Miss Cooley up in the wardrobe. Carpenters, prop men, electricians. Three thousand people that you call "units". Units who have homes and families and kids and rent to pay and doctor's bills. Miss Plum, please! - Go ahead! Sell the studio. But remember this when you sit at your new desk in New York emptying ashtrays. That thousands of people you threw out of work .. Will be walking the streets humbling themselves to the grocer and butcher. Hungry because of you! Miss Plum .. you are hysterical. Sure I am! I am one of those units. - You are no a unit. You are different. - No, I am not different. And from now on I'm not even a loyal employee nor a close personal friend. Miss Plum. Under the circumstances, what else can I do? Nothing. You fired Quintain, the one man who may have been able to do something. Hello. Get me Mr Quintain's residence. Hello. I want to speak to Mr Quintain. Oh. Where can I locate him? Well, hasn't he some favorite haunt? Oh. Mr Quintain. Him haunting Trocadero for two days. Thank you. Oh no you don't. You ain't getting in here again. Aside, my friend. I stand on my constitutional rights. Go away or you'll be sitting on them. You know, you are the most consistently irritating .. Okay, then. It's a deadlock. Mr Quintain. Ah, Mr Dodd. - I've got to speak to you. I claim the privilege of buying you a little drink. No, really. I've got to speak to you. - Over a little drink, my friend. Then I shall be forced to render you helpless. Drive on. Mr Quintain. Doesn't the fate of 3,000 people mean anything to you? Only the fate of one people means anything to me. She's a little skunk. Now look here. Oh, leave me alone. But Mr Quintain .. - Sick him, baby. Sick him. Ah, now that's the first reasonable argument you've presented. Feeling better? Yeah. Lots better. Ah, but what's the use of talking? Even if I could fix the picture, Cheri would have to okay the cutting. Then I shall deprive her of that power. Throw away your dream book. Mr Quintain, there is a clause in every star player's contract. Quote: If an artist commits acts that prejudice the public against the picture industry. By doing anything which brings her in to public hatred, contempt or ridicule. The contract is then breached. Unquote. So what? So, I shall involve her in a scandal. Say, that's not so funny at that. She'll let you. I'm sure she will. I've always had the impression. That Miss Cheri is inclined to make advances. Dodd, you've hit something. Washing Cheri out of the picture business is the answer for both of us. Well .. wish me luck. Dodd, I've got an angle from these preview cards. I got a hunch. I hope my endeavours won't be wasted. You realize that this makes you a libertine and a charlatan don't you? Yes. I am fully aware of that. And I am quite willing to make the sacrifice. Wait a minute. You are not the only one that's making the sacrifice. I still love that dame. I wish I knew why. Well. Oh, no. But Mr Nassau. This is a question of good faith. Here, I have called this special meeting of my board. I've fought with them. I've persuaded them to accept your offer for Colossal. And now. I don't know how I'm going to explain your change in attitude to them. That's regrettable, Mr Pettypacker. But I'm in a meeting right now with my own board. Your Mr Dodd has destroyed Colossal's greatest asset. Miss Cheri. No. Further negotiations are impossible. I am sorry, Mr Pettypacker. Wait, Mr Nassau. Now suppose I told you that my board has authorised me to fire Dodd. Close the payroll and turn the plant over to you. Colossal is still a fine property, Mr Nassau. And I am talking immediate delivery. Frankly Mr Pettypacker, we've made up our minds but .. Hang on, I'll make one last effort. The first race. "Down the stretch, My Oh My and Kaftan neck and neck." "Nammy third and High Life closing fast." "They are in, and its a photographic finish." "What a race." You win, Mr Pettypacker. Alright. Our attorneys in New York can handle that. You are a lucky man. So long. Signed, sealed and delivered. Oh, I'd love to see Atterbury Dodd's face round about now. Me too. [ Telephone ] Hello? Send me a page boy, please. [ Telephone ] Hello? Dodd speaking. - "I know it's Dodd speaking." "We've sold out to Nassau." "You're fired." Come in. You sent for me, sir? - Yes. Please deliver this not to Miss Cheri's dressing-room. Yes, sir. So you didn't have time to say it all to her last night? And it won't keep until tonight. Is that it? Miss Plum, I have been dismissed. Oh, you are breaking my heart. After four years with Pettypacker and Sons. Look .. this is a closing check. I've been dismissed too along with 3,000 others in case you're interested. I should break out in a hot sweat because you lost your job? You sold out your stockholders and you crossed up your employees. I did it for the good of my company. - What you did was shoot the works. For what? Hi, Dodd. You put up a great battle. Do you mind if I hear the results? The office is yours now, Mr Nassau. I admire your attitude. And no hard feelings. You have a lot of virtues I admire. Have I, Mr Nassau? Atterbury. You are a brilliant man. What difference does it make which side you're on, as long as you win? I'll give you a job right now at $75,000 a year. Do it with a handshake. "Sit downers in the steel strike have defied being ousted them for 48 hours." "Stay tuned to this station for further details. We now return you .." Well, that's more than the Pettypackers every paid you. Much more, Mr Nassau. An even dozen, I think. Huh? Oh yes. Well, think it over. Thank. I will. Excuse me, Mr Nassau. - Take as much time as you want to. I have nothing to do but wait for the eighth race at Hialeah. "And here we are now at Hialeah and it's typical Florida weather." "Great weather for a great race and that is just what it promises to be here." An 18 carat, full-jewelled heel. How you doing, Rattlebury? Hello. A nice day. You say it's a nice day? Well I say it ain't. It's a rotten day for all of us. I'm sorry. Dreadfully sorry about your jobs. Alright, alright. Be the stuffed shirt. Yeah, rattle home, Rattlebury. It's the dirtiest double-cross every pulled on a woman. You think that's a double-cross? Here, get a load of a treble cross. So what? You know where that luscious close-up is going? Right in the can. And here is what takes its place. You're cutting me out of the picture. Not out, baby. Just down to a whisper. Instead of you chasing Sir Jeffrey, the gorilla is going to chase you. And you'd be surprised how much sense that makes. Oh Doug, no matter what I've done to you. Baby, it will make a picture out of this cellulite garbage. And it's the only way to make a good woman out of a very bad actress. You've ruined my career! Alright. I've got another career for you when you come out of that fog. Yeah, that will give you a rough idea. That one is on me. Sweetheart, I've pulled a rabbit out of a hat. All we need to make it a real smasheroo are a few added shots of the gorilla. Here. I've made a list of the sets. You'd better okay them so the art department can start building. Mr Quintain. I have just been dismissed. You .. fired? Everyone. The studio has been sold to Nassau. How do you like that. All this work for .. And when we were that close. A couple of more days and we'd have been in the bag. Mr Quintain. Assuming you had those 48 hours. What else would you need? Nothing except those guys out there. We got the gorilla on the lot. Ah but .. what difference does it make? The difference in the lives of those people. Mr Quintain, you can have those 48 hours. And that manpower. Just like that? - Just like that. If those gates are locked. Then Nassau is prevented from taking over the studio. You can't do that. He's on the lot. There are 3,000 other people on this lot who might resent his presence here. You're talking about twenty years in the can. That's unlawful possession. But Colossal must be saved for those people. Hey. Whatever became of that Atterbury Dodd who used to call the guys "units" and .. Cogs in a machine. Well .. I must admit to a certain modification of viewpoint. And a twenty year rap doesn't matter? It seems to me that the only thing that really matters. Is that a man be true to himself. I mean for instance. If it's an essential part of his nature to be clean .. then he should be. If he dislikes chicanery he must be straightforward. Not for hope of reward or fear of punishment but because .. That's the kind of a man he is. It's not a question of who's right or who's wrong. It is simply a question .. Of what is inside a person. Does that make any sense to you? How much did he offer you? $75,000. How did you guess? Sweetheart, I'll split that twenty years with you. Move over. But don't forget, that in Hollywood when you turn the other cheek, they kick it. Mr Quintain. Would you mind very much .. If I called you by your first name? I'd like nothing better. Thank you, Douglas. Carry on, Joan of Arc. Stop. We've got to stop them. Gentlemen! Fellow workers. Fellow workers. I must talk to you. You've got to listen to me. I must talk to you. Stop! Out of the way, white-collar. I command you. Stop! Now you've got to listen to me. I don't mind being a target if you'll just listen to me. Hey, you look like a Spanish omelette! Wait a minute, wait a minute. Let him talk. Make it fast and make it good. Slip them the history of the rhythm of the salmon and leap of the dance. I was discharged this morning too. Wait a minute. Pipe down. Give him a change to talk. Tell 'em the one about mathematics being more important to than meat and drink. Anyone else want to listen? Alright, Dodd. You regard me as your enemy, don't you. I'm capital and you're labor. That's the way you see it, isn't it. Well, it isn't as simple as all that. Let me tell you who our stockholders are. Don't fall for it, suckers. It's bank night. Is there anyone here who owns any Colossal stock? I have a few shares. - Come here. Here you are, men. There is your capitalist. And there is a street-car conductor in Denver. A bricklayer in Chicago, a soldier's widow in Memphis. 30,000 of them. Their savings built this plant. And what's happening now? A small group of financial tricksters .. Headed by Ivor Nassau is trying to close it. Well the stockholders can't afford to see it closed. Any more than we can. There is no trouble here that a good picture won't cure. Mr Quintain tells me that we can have a .. Smasheroo in Sex and Satan if we only finish it. We can expose Nassau. We can save the studio and our jobs. So, I'm asking you for 48 hours work. I have no money to pay for those 48 hours. But I pledge you my word .. I can't give you anything but love .. Quiet. Quiet! I now I am doing this very badly, but .. Won't you please try and understand. Because it is vitally important to us all. Do as I ask and I pledge you my word. That I will convince the stockholders .. That we are entitled to an interest in this business that we have saved. Let's not sit down. Let's stand up and fight. Yeah, but can we hold on? Nassau will have the law on us. Of course he will. But there's 3,000 of us. We won't let the law in. Ah, skip the speeches and let's go home. Mr Quintain needs carpenters, electricians .. All of us, including the gorilla, for 48 hours. What do you say, gentlemen? What do you say, juicers? Hey! I own the gorilla. The gorilla says yes. We'll show them a real fight. - Fight on, fight on! Mr Potts. In my youth I learned an axiom. That a straight line is the shortest distance between two points. I must have slipped. Thank you. Thank you, gentlemen. Excuse me just one moment. [ Radio: ] "At the half, Cream Puff and Hoola Girl neck and neck. Boy, what a race." "Coming down the stretch now. Cream Puff in the lead." "Look at that Cream Puff. It's Cream Puff by two lengths." "Hoola Girl second and Sidewinder third." "Stand by. I'll have the prices for you in a moment." Mr Nassau. You offered me a position. Sure. Dodd. I think you're intelligent. I need intelligent men in my organisation. That's a deliberate falsehood, Mr Nassau. You think I'm stupid. Too stupid to know that this is a bribe. - A bribe? For what? To prevent my dissolving this sale, Mr Nassau. And to avoid an investigation at which I intend to charge you with conspiracy. Why you .. - If you please, sir. What's this, Dodd? Archimedes law of leverage, Mr Nassau. Colloquially known as Jujitsu. Gentlemen. I give you .. Ivor Nassau. It was me that threw that tomato at you. I'm awfully sorry. Don't mention it. Dodd, my friend. Congratulations. Have you another tomato? Oh, sure. Thank you. A bulls-eye. Yes, indeed. Oh, Mr Dodd. You were wonderful. Thank you, Miss Plum. Miss Plum, take a telegram. "Messrs Pettypacker and Sons. Wall Street. New York City." "This will advise you that for failure to deliver to buyer." "You still own this business." "Have checked all items." "Carefully." Miss Plum. If you please. Miss Plum. Will you marry me? What, no build-up? That's the picture business. Well. Where were we, Miss Plum? Have checked all items .. carefully. Yes .. carefully. Stop. Enormous profits are .. In the bag. For Colossal this year. Hello? Send a truck to Mr Koslofski's residence .. To pick up various furnishings belonging to the property department. Mr Quintain, please. Douglas? We are now in business. Hey honey, if you could cook I'd marry you. Precisely. "Will outline plans for future operations." "When we meet at the .." "Investigation which I propose to demand." "On behalf of the stockholders." Why, Miss Plum. You. I am sure we are going to be very happy. Miss Plum. # s d #
