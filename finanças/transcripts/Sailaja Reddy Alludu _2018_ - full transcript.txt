'Love unites people.' 'But ego and pride divides them.' 'Humans can end any kind of relationships very easily..' '..just to satisfy their ego.' 'Ego can separate a father and a son..'

'This is the story of a man who sacrificed his love for his ego.' What is going on? How long will you keep looking at those photos? Hello uncle. We can look at them and talk about you forever. There is no end to your accomplishments.. ..and to the accolades you have received. You are a great man, Mr. Rao. I love your attitude when it comes to staying on top. You worked hard to earn a good name and status. Extraordinary man! Thank you. I hope to remain the same all my life. Mr. Rao, we are truly fortunate.. ..to know you and to become part of your family. - We are lucky! - Please come. Sir, we are about to start. Your son isn't here yet. He will be here. Let us start and he will join us. He is my son. He will be on time. Sorry, boss. I am a little late. - Keys. - You are very late. Keys. Boss! Actually, I did not borrow your car to take my mother to the hospital. I had to drop my girlfriend at the airport. I am sorry, boss. - It's okay. - Here are your keys. Boss! I thought you would get very upset with me and fire me immediately. How can you be so cool about what I did? Sorry, boss. Here are your keys. If you expected me to fire you.. - ..I am sure you realized your mistake. - Yes. Then what is the point of getting upset? Keys please. Boss! How can you be so patient? Looks like God gave you a super positive mind.. ..only to bear up with stupid people like us. - Keys, boss. - I will indeed get upset with you.. ..if you don't hand me the keys immediately. My dad is not as patient as me. Keys please. How could he bring such stupid people to my house? I don't need praises for my achievements. Do they even know anything about me? Do they have any idea about my ways and my thinking? - What is wrong with you? - Sorry, sir. I thought they would get to know you better if I show them what awards your received. That is the stupidest thing I heard. Complete nonsense! What happened? Shanti, if you like me we can move to the next step. I am a hundred percent sure about you. I like you very much, Shanti. - Excuse me! - Yes? You are not on a date to say that you like her or that you love her. We are discussing marriage here. Liking her is not enough. You have to like me too. Who wouldn't like you, Mr. Rao? We even brought the priest along to fix a date for the wedding. - Isn't that true? - Yes, dad. If you can consider this as the marriage altar.. ..and wash the feet of your son-in-law.. ..we are all too eager to take our daughter-in-law home. Did he step on some shit to wash his feet? Dear, why are you being so rude? Let me handle this. Or do I look like an employee in your son's factory? What made you think that I would wash his feet? Don't get it wrong, sir. It is our tradition, part of wedding rituals for.. ..a father-in-law to wash his son-in-law's feet. After all you are giving your daughter's hand in.. Wait, that is not yet decided. Many influential people will attend the wedding. Your son far younger to me. And he is no match to me.. ..in education, status or anything for that matter. I can never bring myself to wash his feet and sprinkle them on my head. No! I am a father and I have a daughter. I will let her marry him and they can go ahead. That's all. Mr. Rao, it is our tradition to consider son-in-law as a God. To wash his feet is a sign of your respect.. ..for accepting your daughter as his wife. How can you consider that as an insult? I know which traditions to follow and how. And, please, stop talking as if we are relatives. It is very irritating. I just cannot bear it. If everything works out and we agree to this wedding.. ..I will let you know how and when to talk to me. - Understood? - No sir. I don't think I can handle people who are particular even about the way we talk. Please, dad. Son, do I really need new problems in my life now? It is true that we are not as rich as you. Yes, my son's company is smaller than yours. But remember one thing. You are giving your daughter in marriage. It may be better for her if you were to be a little humble. Really? Is that a rule? Why should a bride's father bow his head? I thought you had sense. Do you even realize how stupid you sound? - Sorry, uncle. My dad was just being.. - What? No, he knows exactly what he is doing. I don't mind my daughter marrying a poor man. But I will not forgive people who speak in a roundabout and devious manner. - Forgive me? - Dad! Whoever asked you to forgive me? Hey! Mind your tongue. Out of my house! Right now! We are not so keen on staying either. I don't think you will ever get married.. ..as long as your father behaves so egoistically. Think about it. - I know how and when to get my daughter married. - Don't! - Out of my house! - Don't touch me! Take him away! Nonsense! What's wrong with him, mom? Why would he feel so egoistical about washing son-in-law's feet? What made you marry him anyway? I don't get it! I have two wonderful children out of this marriage. That's all I need. I am sure I inherited positive thinking from you. That is exactly why I tolerate him and let him get away. But, how are we going to find a groom.. ..for her if he is going to continue behaving this way? We will definitely find one. Maybe she is meant to marry a better man. Maybe that is why God let this happen today. Let us wait and see. Forget it. Don't even expect her to sympathize with us. She is his wife before she became a mother to us. She is still defending him instead of trying to change him. - Hey! - You want him to change? Why don't you and your sister try to change him? You both know very well how he is. We need a miracle to change him. Sir, maybe Pranic Healing will help your father. Why don't you try it? - Chari! - Yes, sir. Who is that? Maybe she is here to visit your father. Should I find out? No. I don't want her to leave if she is here for someone else. Let me watch her for some time. Oh, my God! I see sparks flying everywhere. "The moment I saw you.." Maybe. Looks like she too is enjoying the attention. Go ahead, sir. Make good use of your time. Imprint her every feature in your heart. She seems a little irritated. - Yes. - Go and find out. Excuse me! What can I do for you, madam? What took you so long? Is chivalry dead? Why couldn't you come before? I guess I brought this upon myself. Anyway, who are you looking for, madam? I am looking for this address. I am new, I am shifting here. Why couldn't you ask us? You saw us standing there. Me and ask someone? I offer help to others, I don't ask for help. 'She surely reminds me of your father.' You can ask me now. Sure, let me see the address. I am sure it is this house according to the pin. But that is your house, isn't it? Yes. But the top floor is vacant. I thought maybe you are here for that. What is taking them so long? Your friends? Why don't you come into our house.. ..and enjoy our hospitality till your friends arrive? Please, madam. Sir is inviting you. Step into my sir's kingdom like a princess. Oh, even the nature is welcoming you. Even the birds are calling out to you. Look at that, madam. Even the flowers are begging you to come in.. ..by falling at your lovely feet. Wait! Left leg first. Left leg? Oh! You are amazing, sir. Anu! Our villa is over there! Why are you going there? Useless friends! They always enter at the wrong time. Sorry, I brought you in because I thought.. .. that this was the house according to Google maps. It is not our fault, madam. Stupid nature is at fault. Shut up! Stupid birds! Everything gave out wrong indications. You can go, madam. Stop! Not you, madam. I was talking to these flowers. Don't you have any sense? All they know is how to fall at a woman's feet. Stupid flowers! Senseless flowers! Here you go. Why did you come so late? That is our villa. Come with me. - P.K. Susheela! - Yes? By the way, who is that cute and arrogant girl? She is the most proud and egoistical girl in the entire state. What does she do? Fine Arts, JNDU. I find it hard to believe that she is an artist. I see no stability in her. Then why are you friends with her? At first we were willing, now we have no choice. What do you mean? You are not a slave. Friendship is supposed to be a bond. You are right. Does she eat by herself or do you have to feed her? I know you are being sarcastic, but you are right. Look at Kumari. She follows her around 24 hours a day as if she was born to be a slave to her. Anu is too proud even to bend down to pick up her bag. She needs an assistant for everything. Can't help it. Bye. Bye. They look more like victims rather than friends. Anyways, I guess another person in our family is interested in getting married. One proposal failed yesterday. But another one proved successful today. Madam, eat this. Napkin. - Please come to the wedding. - Do come. Thank you. Who else do we have to invite? Soujanya! I need you to invite one guest for me. Please. Who? She is the younger version of dad. I will explain later. Come with me. She is standing right there. Hi, Anu. Did you like our colony? Yes. What do you want? This is Soujanya, my sister's friend. I consider her my sister too. Their wedding is tomorrow. And today is their music ceremony. It would be nice if you could come and wish I mean bless them. Hey, why are you smiling like that? It is okay even if you don't know her. She is inviting everyone in this colony. She will be happy if you come and bless her. Give her the invitation. What are you waiting for? Here you are. Don't be silly, Chaitu. My wedding, for that matter even this music ceremony.. ..wouldn't be taking place without her. In fact, I gave her the first invitation. Do you mean you know her already? Yes. We've been friends since we were kids. Yes. Just for the reason we studied together as kids.. ..she has been a loyal friend to me. I didn't miss my mother because of her. In fact, I should be getting married in a temple. But being as loyal friend as she is.. ..she booked Chiraan Fort.. ..and arranged a grand wedding. That is how Anu madam is. Once she considers anyone her friend.. ..she will go to any lengths for them. She takes very good care of them. Great! Yes, I am always great. - Are all arrangements in place for the evening? - Yes, Anu. Do you need anything else? I had no idea there are such positive things about you. I have fallen for you, babe. Boss, let me tell you something. A little ego adds beauty to a woman. It increases her charm. But her ego is as big as the sea itself. You will drown if you jump into it. - What do you mean? - I mean what you do, sir. Pickle is meant to be an accompaniment to rice. Doesn't mean you can apply it all over your face. You already have a basic version at your home in the form of your father. Do you really need an advanced version? Chari! Roses have thorns. Pomegranate has skin over it. Chocolate has a wrapper over it. But do we stop eating it just because it is wrapped? We open it and enjoy it. Ego is wrapped around my dad and Anu. It doesn't mean I should stop loving them, Chari. - Understood, sir. - Good. The very fact that you compared your father to the girl you love.. ..shows how deeply you are in love with her. Remember one thing, Chari. Everything we love in life has a drawback. Our life will be very colorful.. ..if only we can accept it and endure it. Like a rainbow. Yes. Done, sir. From now on I am at your beck and call. What would you do if you were in this situation? My dear great artists of India. Sir, why limit to India. Call us great artists of the whole world. Calm down and listen to what I have to say. Next week we arranged an art exhibition in our college. And ICat Solutions company is sponsoring a hundred thousand rupees for that event. But the company MD, Mr. Chaitanya wants us to draw his portrait.. ..and display it in the art gallery before he can hand over that cheque. And I am sure you went overboard and assured him that our Anu.. ..will make an exact replica of his face.. ..and that the portrait will be so excellent.. .. that it will get excellent ratings. Looks like you know more about media than about art and culture. Why don't you do one thing? Go to movies every Friday.. ..and write reviews about them. Sit down! Anu! This is the most prestigious issue for our college. I want you to draw a portrait for him. Prove that art is where Anu is and Anu is where art is. And only you are capable of doing it. I know. Only I am capable of doing it. - Actually.. - Sir! Our art student is here. He is the one I told you about. Hey, Anu! Sir, she stays in our colony. - Their villa is adjacent to hers. - Hi Anu. - Anu, tell him. - I thought you said he is an MD. Of course. Don't you have a card? Show it to her. - Sir is the topmost and the foremost CEO of.. - Stop! Stop! Stop! I don't want to hear about or acknowledge his greatness. You can keep it with yourself. He is sponsoring a hundred thousand rupees. You will get the first prize. I told him that you are our top student. - Do I really have to do it? - Yes, please. Fine, come in the evening. Anu, he came with a cheque. Why don't we finish the portrait right now? I am sure it is a piece of cake for you. That way we can get the money right now into our back account. Fine. You can wait downstairs. Thanks, Anu. Job done. - Done. - Thank you so much, sir. - You dealt with her in the most convincing manner. Thank you. - You are welcome. She is the most arrogant girl I have seen. How will spending an hour with her work out in your favor? Spending an hour with her in itself is a blessing, sir. Where do I look, Anu? What do you mean? Look at my eyes. Okay. Don't look at my eyes. Look at my nose. I think your lips are much better than your nose. They are cute, I will look at them. Sir, you cannot look at what you like. Just do as she tells you. History proves that you don't get the best output when you hurt artists. Right madam? Anu madam, fruits. She didn't even work hard. She just picked up the pencil. Chari! It must be for creativity. You can continue, Anu. Please. Mind blowing. She looked into sir's eyes and she drew them exactly. You are lady Picasso, madam. Really? - Hello? - Sir, your phone is with me. But I am wearing the Bluetooth. Yes, I am coming right away. Anu, sorry. This is an urgent call. We will sit in the same setup in the evening at my home. - What? - Listen. Please arrange a vehicle and shift everything to my place, okay? - Yes, tell me. I am coming. - Sir, should I switch on the phone? Sir, I thought you wanted to spend an hour. But you didn't even last 15 minutes. All your effort will go waste. That one hour is very valuable to me. I didn't want to spend it in one go. So I am going to divide it into ten sessions of 15 minutes each. - Like a web series. - Amazing, boss. So you are going to reveal your love story.. ..to the audience in phases and in installments. - Exactly. - Did you put off the Bluetooth, sir? - Chari! - Sorry. Okay, you can go. Anu?! How come you finished so fast? Sir, one should be very lucky for me to sit with them and draw their portrait. And this guy gets up and walks out suddenly. He asked me to come to his house in the evening. What does he think of himself? Strange. He said he would sit for more than an hour. Maybe he had some urgent business to take care of. I apologize to you in behalf of him. - Even he apologized to me. - Then what? But he hurt my feelings. Dear, don't let such small things hurt your feelings. I clicked a photo while you were drawing.. ..and posted it on our college website. You know how students are. They are always with their phones. They are overexcited about your art. They cannot wait to see the finished portrait. They are even asking for updates every hour. Is there no other way? Please don't try to find any other options. Just try to get him to cooperate and finish the portrait. Thanks for your cooperation. Thank you. - But sir.. - No, don't say anything. - Sir, please.. - I know you are doing it. I cannot hear anything else. Yes! Come on, come on. Sir! Anu madam is calling you. Hey! Hi Anu! Hi? Stop playing, come and sit here. I am full of sweat, Anu. I don't think sweat will look good in my portrait. I will be there tomorrow morning, okay? Bye, see you. Why would sweat be seen in the portrait? As if you are going to draw that too. Good morning, Anu. I haven't brushed my teeth yet. I will brush my teeth, take a shower, dress up and come directly to your place. Then my portrait will look fresh. Who will find out from the portrait.. ..whether you have brushed your teeth or not? You will. Anu, why do you keep such silly people around you? I'll be there. Sir. If this portrait looks as good as they claim.. ..we will arrange a big display in our street. What do you people think about Anu madam? The picture draws itself.. .. even before she picks up the pencil. Picture draws itself? She seems like an amazing artist, boss. It is done. Come and see. Madam. Anu madam! That is mind blowing. Out of the world. She says it is mind blowing. Chari! I wasn't this nervous even while going to MCET exams. - Let's go and see. - Ready? One.. - Two.. - Three! 'Who is he?' 'Who else? Me!' 'Maybe you should write your Aadhar address and your phone number too.' 'Who would believe even if I write those details?' 'I don't think anything will help when this looks nothing like you.' What happened? How is it? How is it? How is it? We were so speechless when we saw it that we ended up talking telepathically. My boss thinks that he is looking into a mirror. Boss! This is not a mirror. - If it was, you would see the both of us. - Okay. Why don't you say anything? - Please say something, boss. - 'What can I say?' Boss is still trying to talk telepathically. Boss, speak up. What can I say? I don't think I look this good even in real life. Do I really look so handsome, Anu? You don't see any mistakes, do you? What mistakes will he find when it is not even his? Dude, bring a gun. I see snakes here. Hey, shut up. Actually, I do find a small mistake. What? A mistake in my drawing? Where is it? Show it to me. Show it to me right now. I mean it is a very small one. It will look amazing if you can just erase this hair. - You mean to say that the rest is correct, accurate and flawless? - Yes. Anu, their faces are telling a different story. That looks like a mirror, is it? From which angle? Show it to us. - Excuse me, why can't you mind your own business? - Yes. Why are you creating problems? Silly people. Anu, don't give me such serious looks. Why don't we ask someone else to get a clear idea? Don't worry. I can prove it to you right now. Excuse me, boss. One minute, please. How long are you going to look at that? Say something. This is my portrait. It is mine. True, the man in the sketch has exactly your features. That doesn't mean this is yours. Then is it yours? Me? Do you mean my face is that ugly? Look at that crooked nose, those ugly thick lips. - That is not even a drawing. It is.. - Chari! Mind your tongue. - Sir, I cannot take this.. - Chari! Madam, you drew by looking at me, right? Hey, shut up! I will give you a tight slap if you say another word. It was my fault to call a man who has no appreciation for fine art. Get lost! Anu, don't you worry. They drew my face and are saying that it is someone else. Get lost! Go! Anu, let me call someone who has some knowledge. Enough! You deliberately tried to insult me make me lose confidence.. ..tried to end my career and crush the artistic spirit in me.. ...by calling such a man for an opinion. I had no idea his opinion would change your future. Madam, please don't mind me telling you. This is my sincere advice. Display this drawing in the exhibition and announce that we will give a prize.. ..to those who can guess the person in this correctly. We can even make sir stand next to it for a clue. I will kill you if you say another word. I understand the matter now. You are trying to find faults with my drawing because I refused to look at you. You are trying to make me feel guilty. No, Anu. That is not true. Please. Don't say anything. You made me hate my own drawing. Oh, no! Hi! Hi. Shall we go for a movie? Why would I go with you? No way? Fine. I will go with you. Take me. Hey! Hey! Why are you just standing there? Help them! - Dad! - Yes? This is CelebKonect app. This is a platform that connects celebrities with the common man. I studied it thoroughly. I feel this app has a good future. You don't have to discuss this with your dad. You have rights as the company MD. Go ahead and pay them if you like it. No! Don't say that and ruin him. He is MD and he is my son. Yet, I don't like it when he does things without consulting me. Sorry, sir. I just thought this is a small matter. Don't be silly. They check with me even before they cook lunch. I don't eat it if they consult me. I don't tolerate people who do things without my permission. Be it friends or family. I never forgive such people. Hello?! Oh, really? I will be there in half an hour. Okay then. Where to? Fine Arts college again? Why do you waste your time, sir? It is easier to turn mud into gold than to make her fall in love with you. You wasted 3 days for that portrait. Then you spent 6 days singing song for her. What other excuse will you find now? Who will be your scapegoat now? - Who can it be? - Who will you find? Boss, you sacrificed me for your love. I used to cover my body in full hands shirt. Now it is standing exposed to public. You made me dress up in this weird costume with leaves. What if the wind blows away the leaves? What if I sneeze? And what if the thread breaks? My dignity is at stake here. My dear students. This is a rare specimen of early man. Realistic model. - Make your art pieces look absolutely natural. - Do it fast. Sir, wouldn't it be more natural.. ..if we remove the leaves? What do you think you'll find if you remove the leaves? Are you here to sculpt or to look at my body? If you are that interested, go get married.. .. and dress up your husband as an early man. That will teach you. Sir, can you please turn this way? Okay. Oh, God! I know I didn't have a choice. You are sculpting. Why are you dressed up like that? Sir, putting myself in the same position.. ..helps me to make sculpt awesome statues. But, this is horrible for me. Wind is blowing away the leaves. Keep it covered, you fool! Oh, no! She looks super upset. I am sure she is going to lash out at me. Hey! Why were you staring? Actually, I was admiring the building.. I am talking about staring at me, not at the building. You? I don't understand. I know your intentions. Don't lie and hurt my feelings. I still don't talk to my childhood friends who hurt me when I was a kid. Stop trying to impress me. Stop coming to this college. Or you will never see me here. Hello! Wait a minute! I don't understand what makes you so overconfident. Yes, I am following you. But it is not you that I like. Then who is it? Kumari? 'Awesome idea. I will have to use Kumari to get to you.' You guessed it right. I am a hundred percent in love with Kumari. It is okay even if I don't love you. But if I ever get married, I would want.. ..your assistant who serves fruits without even asking. I sat in front of you to get that portrait done.. ..and followed you around singing that song.. ..only for Kumari. Enough! Kumari, Kumari, Kumari. Even I don't take her name so many times. You don't have to but I will. I'll take her name with heart full of love, Kumari 21 F. She is over 27. Never mind. Samantha was older than Chaitu in 'Ye Maya Chesave.' They fell in love, got married. That movie was a big hit. Are you out of your mind? Look at her and look at you! I consider all humans equal. I don't have any ego problems like you. Riches don't matter to me. That's why I'm in love with Kumari. Why are you so suddenly smitten with Kumari? This is not sudden. It's been going on for a while. Since you know the truth now.. ..why don't you act as a mediator between us.. ..and help me win my love? They say that you should eat sweets.. ..before you venture out for doing something good. Enjoy this chocolate and think well, okay? Anu, please. Only you can make this happen. Thank you, Anu. Bye. Anu madam. I am going out to the market. Missed her. Why don't you give me some good advice.. ..on how to make her fall for me. Go and push her, she may fall. Even she can crack jokes with a straight face. Doesn't she have a poker face, sir? What else do you expect from me? Do you really think and plan to woo someone like her? Don't be so judgmental, Anu. Girls like immediately say yes or no.. ..the moment a guy proposes to you. Do you think a women like her.. .. accept my love so easily and say yes to me? Boss! I didn't know you had so much love in your heart. My love cannot be measured in human terms, Chari. My love is endless, immeasurable. Oh, my God, infinite love. Come on, follow me. Where are you going? She went out to buy meat. Loving the people we love means sharing their problems. Love means taking good care of them. Chari, continue. It means carrying their bags and buying meat for them. Let's go, sir. Let's get into the car and go after her. - Chari! - I meant go and solve her problems. - Chari. - Yes, boss. - Am I right in guessing that she is behind us? - Yes, boss. Oh, my God! I'm so terrified right now, sir. You should have told me the truth. You don't know how angry Anu madam can get, sir. I don't understand how she is going to fall in love with you.. ..if we pretend to be in love and go around in car. Your Anu madam has ego issues. I don't understand. It's a person's sense of self-esteem or self-importance.. Sir? I guess you didn't get that too. Pride. Extreme pride. Yes, that is very true. Since she is so proud, she will want the love that I am showing you. Oh, I understand it now. She didn't speak to me properly yesterday. I think she was thinking about you all night. - Is that so? - Yes, sir. I woke up late at night and saw that.. ..she was wide awake even at 2 in the morning. - Chari! - Boss. Looks like daddy's scheme worked out after all. Madam is right on track. Call and tell that Anu madam gave his number.. ..and hand over my car to him. He will repair and give it back. Take your bloody car out of my way. Hey! Come. Who do you think you are to call me like that? Hey! Did you really think you could get away so easily? It was your fault, you came in my way. You're driving rashly, and you're drunk during day. You should be ashamed of yourself. Where do you think you're going? - Leave me. - Come with me, I will show you real speed. Come on. Hey! Who are you? Who else? Must be her lover. You guessed it right. The harder I hit, the stronger will be our love. Isn't that right, darling? Start the music. Glass.. No.. Stop. Sorry, madam. I don't need your stupid apology. Okay, I hope your ego is satisfied. Sorry, Anu. Don't feel bad about telling them that you are my lover. Normally, I would react in the same way.. ..if anyone mistreats a woman. I just went with the flow. Don't take it seriously and keep thinking about it, okay? Anu! Good morning! It's 9:30 already. Get up. How come you are here? Where is Kumari? She got up early, dressed beautifully and went over to meet Chaitu. She asked you to give her a missed call after you wake up. Chaitu, this is too much! - Oh, no. - Hi. What? Having lunch with my sister? Okay then. Bye. Okay, bye. Where is Kumari? In my heart. I mean physically. Physically, mentally and every way she is right here. Chaitu, I hate what is going on. I don't want you to love her. Why? I think she is responding quite well. So what? I am happy that she is at least responding.. ..even though she isn't giving any response. Okay, I can do the same. Love me. What? Will you love me? I don't know. But I want the love you are showing Kumari. I don't want you to do anything for her. Do everything for me. Now tell me that you love me. I will respond with an 'I love you too.' Do you really think you could just pass orders? Love is meant to be expressed beautifully. It is supposed to grow deep in our heart.. ..it should stir emotions which.. ..should reflect in our eyes and reach the other person's heart. But this is not the way. And if I have to explain even such simple things to you.. ..I am sure you know nothing about love. I cannot accept your love just because you proposed to me. It would be like entering the cricket pitch alone and with no one to support. What do you mean? I mean I'll have to do the balling, batting and fielding. I'll have to catch the ball myself, get myself out.. ..and also be the umpire who says that I am out. Love is a great game in which both the players.. ..have to show a lot of understanding. Only then will we win the match of marriage and win the cup of happiness. And I don't think you are capable of all that. Chari was right all along. He said I was lucky that I fell in love with Kumari. If I had loved you and texted you asking for a kiss.. ..you would send others to kiss me.. ..because you would be too proud to come to me. Thank God. Anu madam, what are you doing here? I have been looking for you since morning. Where did you go? Anyway, it looks like it is going to rain. Let's go inside. What have you done to me? You have turned me into a complete loser. Do you have any idea what a fool I made of myself today? Why did fall for him and even kiss him when he provoked me? Why did I beg him to love me when he is in love with you? Why would I want to force someone to love me? Who am I and what's my status? You're a human, a woman. And you're in a position where others have to tell you that. Did you understand or do I have to explain further? You are the reason for all this! Don't you dare point fingers at me! Who do you think you are? Do you think you're Miss World or some Miss Universe? Or did you come down from heaven? You're an ordinary girl just like everyone else. Remember that. Ego?! I have a bigger ego than you. But I'm also sensible enough to understand where to stand firm and where to let go. You lack that. You're always upset with me because of your ego. But I tried to turn that into love because I love you. But you never understood that. You kissed me and said that you love me only because I provoked you. If that is the case, you will find a thousand men waiting for you out there. Will you kiss them all and hug them too? Answer me. You will slap them and push them down from the terrace. Then why did you kiss only me? Because you like me. Because you love me. I took Kumari's help and provoked you.. ..only to bring out these feelings in you. You're doing all this because your heart is telling you.. ..that I am the right one for you. But your ego is not letting you accept that. I cannot take it anymore. We are not meant to be with each other. I yearned for you. All I wanted was for you to look at me,.. .. stand by my side and talk to me. It hurt me not to be with you. But right now, I think I will be much happier.. ..if you stay away from me. Bye Anu. Why did you block my number? I don't want you. I no longer need your number. But why? You said that you loved me more than your life. And then you said that you'd be happier if I stayed away from you. Do you know how much it hurt? For the first time in my life I am feeling the pain of losing someone. Without you my life seems empty and dull. You said so yourself. Why would I kiss you if I had not loved you? Tell me. I was impressed with you the same way.. ..you were impressed with me when we met the first day. I felt overjoyed when I understood your feelings.. ..and when you followed me around. I was sure you would confess your love for me.. ..when you came to my college for that portrait. But you hurt my ego by talking about Kumari. You made me cringe and cry. I was very upset and at the same time afraid that I was going to lose you. And that's why I came that day to confess my love. Now tell me that you love me. And I'll respond with an 'I love you too.' I waited for you to come and give me the right address. But when it came to my love, I came to you. Did that not tell you how much I loved you, Chaitu? I'm not like other girls but my love is true just as theirs. I do feel pain too. Think of my arrogance as innocence and love me. Maybe I will never change but endure me. I don't know how else to explain to you. Please, Chaitu. Please. I didn't know you were capable of so much love. And I'm not egoistical to refuse your love now. You would always call me and take my permission even in very small matters. I didn't expect you to bring the woman you love.. ..without even telling me anything about her. I am sorry, dad. You can apologize and satisfy my ego. But I will give my approval if I don't like her. Mind it. - Anu, just come with me. - Where to? What do you mean? Go and talk to him. Pacify him. No way! So, you want to marry Chaitu. Yes. That's nice. Do you see my feet? Fall at my feet and beg me to give my approval. Say, 'Uncle, please accept our love.' Only then will I give my approval. Come on. No, I won't. Dear, there's nothing wrong in touching an older person's feet. Just do as he says and take his blessing. Please don't force me. My ego will never allow me to fall at someone's feet. This is how I am. Accept me if you like me or forget it. - Anu! - Please, Chaitu. I like her. I'm serious. I'm really serious. I'm not kidding. You are perfectly qualified to be my.. ..daughter-in-law and to call me father-in-law. I admire your self-respect, which wouldn't allow.. ..you even to bow down to your lover's father. I admire your nature which wouldn't allow you to.. ..cave in no matter how many people forced you. Hats off to your ego which wouldn't melt even in difficult circumstances. Seriously, child. Do you know how hard it is to find such a girl, Chaitu? Yes, sir. He worked very hard to woo her. - He put in too much effort. - Really? Oh, so sorry. Excuse me. Hello? Congratulations, dear. Of course, sir. That'll be my honor. Just forget about it, sir. Leave it to me. I shall take care of it. Thank you, sir. Thank you. They've elected me as the president this time. - Wow! Congrats, dad. - That's great. Dad has been trying to get this position for five years now. Congrats, uncle. This is all because of you, my dear. My daughter-in-law brought happiness to our home. You can be very positive when you like someone, sir. Shut up! Anyway, leave the party arrangements to me. I will take care of everything. Is everything okay? How does that look? good Where? You look lovely. I have to go. I am surprised that he invited us to this party.. ..in spite of all that happened the other day. Good man. You fool! He invited us to show off his success. Mr. Rao! Welcome. - Congrats! - Thank you. Take this. Mr. Shankar Rao, thank you for coming. You know what? They gave me this position without me having to.. ..falling at anyone's feet or washing them. Just for your information. I thought you should know. He too knows that you invited him to only to say that. - Come on, don't be silly. - Hello, Mr. Rao. - Yes, sir. - Excellent party. Thank you so much, sir. But you shouldn't give that credit to me. - Then who? - It's purely because of my daughter-in-law. Is it? Daughter-in-law? Yes, daughter-in-law. You heard it right, Shankar Rao. She must be around.. Yes, there she is. Isn't she from Warangal? Of course she is. And yes, we considered her for your son. By the way, did her family accept you? My approval matters the most. I don't think they will have any objections. I approve of them and that is all they need to get married. I don't think everyone would agree with that. We backed off because we didn't want to argue. But, it is going to be totally different with her family. So, here is my kind advice to you. Meet her parents first and get their approval.. ..and wait for everything to get confirmed.. ..before you can brag in front of everyone that she is your daughter-in-law. I am not the one to nod my head if they accept and shut my mouth if they reject. I told you, my approval is all that matters here. They will get married. And that's pretty much final. They may or may not get married. You will find out only after you meet her parents. What do you want to find out? I'm going to announce their engagement right here, right now. And I'll see who is going to stop me. She is not the one to show her finger for the ring the moment you say engagement. Looks like you don't know her that well. She will never agree. Excuse me, friends. Here everybody! Attention please. On the stage. Thank you. Thank you so much. In the presence of everyone who came to felicitate me.. .. I would like to share a small family matter.. In fact, it's not a small matter, it's a big one. It's a very important moment. And I would like to share it with all of you. Chaitu, my boy. Come on up, come on. Go, sir. You all know about Chaitu. He is my company's MD and everyone here knows how diligent he is. Do you know what this little boy has done? He chose a life partner who suits my style and status. Yes, there she is. She is Miss Anu. Bachelor in Fine Arts. Why are you still standing there, Anu? Come on up. Come to the stage, dear. Come, come closer. So! Now these two young people need your blessings on their union today. My well wisher Mr. Girisham will bless them as they exchange rings.. ..and garlands as part of their engagement. Thank you. Just need your blessings. Dad, what is going on here? Wait, I still need to announce the date. That is not all. I am going to announce the wedding date as well. It's going to be next month on the 25th. Cheers! We haven't met or informed her family yet. I don't think it's a good idea to announce the engagement. We'll inform them after the engagement. What's the hurry? - Dad! What are you doing? - Get the garlands. Come on! But, dear, shouldn't we wait for an auspicious date? I arranged for this party because today is an auspicious day. Priest said that today is a very good day. Give me your ring. Your daughter-in-law needs it. - Hi there. - Dad! Please stop this right now. I have already announced it. Now I can't change anything. See how Shankar Rao is giving me scornful looks. He challenged me about this today. I have to do this and show him what I am capable of. Mr. Shankar Rao! You rejected his son for sister because you were upset with him. Why are you taking him seriously? I know when and how to handle matters. Mr. Girisham, please come onto the stage. Please. Chaitu, what do we do now? - Anu.. - What is this? Anu, there is no way we can convince him otherwise. That is how he is. And it's impossible to talk to him on such occasions. Anu, just go with the flow for now. I'll take care of the rest later. I can't accept all this. Anu, I'll take care of any problems that might arise. - Okay? Trust me, I'll handle it. Okay? - Chaitu.. Don't worry, I'm with you. What are you guys whispering about? Everyone is waiting for you. Nothing, dad. Come on, let's go. Come with me. Take off that garland and come with us. Who are you and how dare you talk to her like that? Who allowed you inside? That's not important now. Who gave you the right to arrange her engagement without informing us? How dare you! I will see your end! - Hey! Who are you people? - Chaitu, please. - Anu, just look at him.. - He is my uncle. Did you love her without even finding out about her family? Yes, he did. And I fixed the wedding without finding out about you. - What are you going to do now? - Then let me tell you who I am. She is Shailaja Reddy's daughter. Who gave you the right to do whatever you want.. ..without talking to my sister or taking her approval? No one will be able to save you now. - Hey, mind your language.. - Uncle, please. Uncle, please don't do anything rash. Chaitu.. - Anu! - Let's go, uncle. Anu! Anu! One minute, uncle. Your dad made a mistake, Chaitu. Choosing a life partner was never in my hands. I don't think I can ever meet you again.. ..if my mother finds out about this. Forget me. Anu! How dare he comes to my party and threatens me? I'll.. - Vaj.. - I am here, sir. Vajpayee! Take out your phone. Take out your phone and call the Police commissioner. - Call him and tell.. - Hello.. Hello.. Commissioner may be your friend. But they're friends with the Chief Minister. Who is Shailaja Reddy? Now that is a sensible question. Find out who she is and then decide whether to call the commissioner.. ..or to pack your bags and leave. Just tell me who the hell she is. Then I will decide on how to handle her. I'll tell you. 'She is the lady leader to the people in Simpanapalli in Warangal district.' 'She is a sword who was born to slay..' '..men who mistreat and look down upon women.' 'Her very presence creates fear in men.' 'Blood in her veins boil with rage when she sees any women being mistreated.' 'She doesn't forgive that person no matter who he is.' 'She makes sure he is put behind bars..' '..after getting a good thrashing by women.' 'That is Shailaja Reddy.' That is her profile in short. She doesn't forgive a person even if he is a police if he hurts her ego. You have a spontaneous ego. But for her it is a genetic disorder a hereditary disease. Yes. Shailaja Reddy brings down wrath upon any man.. ..who tries to hurt a woman in her village. And you have forced her daughter to get engaged and even fixed her wedding. You will pay for it. By the way, Mr. Rao, you thought you would.. ..satisfy your ego by inviting me to your party. But you ended up satisfying my ego. See you. Vajpayee, give me the phone. - Quick! - Yes, sir. - I know exactly what.. - Dad! - Just one phone call.. - Enough! You've done enough. Don't make this any worse that it already is. Your lack of self-control resulted in Shanti losing the man she loved. Please don't make me lose Anu. Please. I will try calling her again. Anu madam. It is Chaitu sir. He has already called you ten times. Please talk to him. Boss, she took the call. - 'Hello, what is it?' - What do you mean? Did you think I'd forget you just because you asked me to? We are already engaged. You are almost my wife. I have a stronger reason now. That's my bad luck. Anu! Don't worry about anything. We crossed Warangal. We are almost at your village now. I will do anything to convince your mother I mean my future mother-in-law. Really? Are you really that brave? Anu, I will explain the whole matter to your mother. I will even apologize to her and request her to approve of our wedding. Just make sure she doesn't take any decisions till then. I am sure she will find no reason to reject me once she looks at me. Come directly to our home if you are so confident. Okay. Sir, how come she agreed to so easily? Where is your mother? It may take me just ten minutes to make her accept me as her son-in-law. Speak softly. She may kill you if she hears your voice. What? I thought she already came to know about the engagement. Then she would have sought revenge. She wouldn't sit at home. What? Doesn't your mother know about us? Then what exactly happened last night? Anu! Just listen to me. Don't tell mom about what happened here. No one should tell her anything. I will kill myself if any one tells her about this. Uncle, I am especially talking to you. You don't have to go so far. I'll do as you ask. Will you promise me? Yes. But why do we need to hide this matter? Why don't we tell her? - Yes, why don't you? - Then you'll be in the same situation as me. I used to be a star hotel chef. Today I am serving as a cook in this house. - Think carefully. - Hello, sir. You have no idea what madam is capable of. - That is true. - Just wait till you see.. Anu madam. Your mother. What are you afraid of? Introduce us as your friends. We are not allowed to bring even an animal.. ..without taking mom's permission. We are not animals. We are humans. - Manikyam! - Yes, madam. I have a good life partner in mind for you. Madam, don't get confused. Your mother is talking about you. I know. This isn't new for me. Anyway, who is it? You mean the groom? He is from our own village. It's almost like he's right here in our house. Manikyam! I was just kidding, madam. I thought she would find it funny and laugh. But she didn't. He's a doctor, a very good man. He would make a perfect son-in-law for me. But he should suit her as a husband too, right? Just like I match your personality. He will if she marries him. Don't interfere in this, Venu. Stay out of it. As if you care for my opinion. Dad is right. This is about my life. I should like him. I understood what you mean. When you feel like ruining someone's life.. ..and when you find a man like your dad.. ..who follows his wife everywhere she goes.. ..and works for you day and night without a salary.. ..you will let your parents know about it, right? Manikyam! Yes, madam. I thought at least this will make her laugh. But this didn't work either. It is my duty as a mother to look for a groom for you. It's up to you whether to marry him or not. Manikyam, I like it when she's reasonable. Sir, they're discussing about you. My sweet! Hey, you! You're working here as a punishment. This is not a vacation. Let me throw another one. How many did you hide in your trousers? And why are they coming out in installments? I will strangle you if any more sweets fall out. What a funny guy! Shall I throw one? Manikyam! I kept a diamond necklace in your cupboard. Let me know if you like it. I'll have to pay the merchant. You mean my cupboard, madam? Why would she keep it in your cupboard? It would have been nice if you gave it to her yourself. I'll surely do that if she makes me happy. What did you want to talk about? Why don't you and your mother talk to each other? Why are you using that Manikyam as a mediator? We haven't spoken to each other in more than five years. What? 'Everyone in the village respects my mom.' 'She has always lived up to her words.' 'She has never once failed in her life.' 'Mother raised me, her only daughter, just like herself.' 'We were more like sister or friends..' '..rather than mother and daughter.' 'We were very close.' One issue drove a wedge in our relationship.. ..and we stopped talking to each other. 'Our village has only one private hospital.' And the doctor working there would always..' '.. find an excuse to conduct surgery on every woman..' '..who was admitted there for labor and delivery.' 'When mom found out about that..' Today you are doing the 56the caesarean surgery. You know very well that there are no other hospitals nearby. You're doing whatever pleases you for money. You don't wait for normal delivery. You don't care even if they're poor. You create fear and force them to opt for surgery. Madam, I don't need you to tell me how to treat patients. We didn't spend millions of rupees to build this hospital in this village.. ..to treat patients for free, do normal deliveries and take unnecessary risks. You're a woman and a doctor. How could you be so cold? If you don't like what I'm doing go and build a hospital yourself.. ..make your daughter a doctor and give free treatment for women. Mind your tongue. I will do exactly as you said. Wait and watch. 'Mom felt hurt at what that doctor said..' '..and decided to make me a doctor.' 'She filled out an application even without telling me.' Mom! What's this? Find some other way if you want to serve women. But please don't force me. But, Anu, that doctor insulted me. I want you to become a doctor and prove her wrong. I don't want to study medicine to satisfy your ego. I want to do what I like. I like arts. I will do Fine Arts. Is that more important to you than your mother? You care more about me being a doctor than me. Anu, let's discuss this later. Anu! Don't talk too much. - If you go against my wishes.. - I will. 'I hurt my mom very much that day by insulting her in front of everyone.' 'She stopped talking to me after that.' Shailaja, how long are you going to treat her this way? She's your daughter after all. Do you know how insulting it is for me.. ..when people ask how am I going to help them.. ..when I cannot even assert authority over my own child? She has to know how much she hurt me. I will never talk to her again. 'Even I felt hurt that my mom didn't understand me.' 'I decided that I would speak to her only when she would.' That's the beauty! Good job, Anu. Excellent! Boss, consider your problem is solved. Yes, Anu. You are not on talking terms with your mother anyway. I am sure it won't even affect her.. ..if you marry my boss and settle somewhere else. And even if she feels bad about it.. ..all she can do is not talk to you for the rest of your life. You're already used to talking to 30 year old Manikyam. I'm sure he'll live another 30 years. Follow the same process. Your future is safe. How is it, Anu? What do you know about us? We may not talk to each other. But we love each other very much. More love than you can imagine. Chaitu, let me make this very clear to you. I want my mom, I want to stay with her. I want my mom to speak to me again. Okay, Anu. Forget about what he said. I swear to you.. ..I'll mend the bond between you and your mom. I'll make sure she speaks to you again. I'll tell her about our love. We will get married only after she gives her approval. Greetings, madam. Thank you, madam. Madam, they published an article about you in newspaper. Manikyam! My friends are arriving today. Clean up the farm house. They're going to stay here for a week. Manikyam! Don't you know that you need to take my permission before you invite guests? Of course I do, madam. Do I need permission to invite guests to my own house Manikyam? No need, madam. This is your kingdom. You're the princess. Our guests are not artists like me, they're doctors. I am sure you're okay with people in that profession. I think madam gave her word to her friends. Let them come since she invited them. You can always send them away if you don't like them. What do you say? Hello. I will introduce you to our madam after she is done talking to those people. Why are we meeting in the fields anyway? It would have been a much more relaxed conversation.. ..if we were sitting in an air conditioned room.. ..with sweets and snacks in front of us. Sweets and snacks? You know exactly what were going to serve you. But madam should like you before you can eat them. Why wouldn't she like us? We are not some goons, we are doctors. I am Pranic Healing specialist. Pranic Healing? - You mean the no touch, shaking the body method? - Exactly. I want that shaking treatment. Please shake me. Hello, I'm the mother of milkshake. I'll give you a huge discount. Go and enjoy. Then I'll make sure you can stay at our house. What's your answer? First, you married her daughter without her consent. And just because she confronted you.. ..your abused your wife's mother, your mother-in-law.. ..in the most cruel way for a week and locked her in a room. You didn't even consider the fact that she is old, and a widow. Who gave you the right to treat her that way? As if this is a court and they're discussing a big case. Shut up! This is my family matter. I will scold her, beat her and do whatever I like. This one is my wife and that one is her mother. I don't like you confronting me in public like this. And she may face the consequences of your actions. It would be better if you think carefully before you speak or do anything. Look at him, madam. Did you hear what he said? He will ruin my daughter's life. Only you can correct him. What's in her hands? You're at fault for marrying without consent. How dare you threaten me? Narsimha! Put a yoke on his shoulders.. ..and make him plough the all the fields of poor people. Make him work in the fields till he learns how to respect women. Manikyam! My pen slipped from my hands. I thought you said you're mother of milkshake. Why are you shaking with fear? I can't help it. Please hand me my pen. Here you are. Do we really have to go even after watching that episode? You know why we're here. Come on. Doctor, madam is going away. Let's go. - Maybe a little later. - I am with you. Don't be afraid. Come with me. Madam! They're Anu madam's friends, doctors. Hello ma'am. What brings you here for a week? You, ma'am. Chari! We are conducting a survey in all villages.. ..with regard to building a hospital for poor people. Your daughter Anu happened to meet me at the right time. She said that you'd be very happy to see a hospital in this village. Is that true? She's your daughter. She may not speak to you.. ..but she would never lie about anything. She's got your blood. 'O' positive. - Why are we talking about blood now? - Quiet. Shailaja Reddy will always support people with good intentions. - Thank you. - You can stay with us till you finish your work. - Sure. - See you later. I see a lot of potential here. One, you fell in love without your mother's knowledge. Two, you are already engaged. And then you brought Shailaja Reddy's.. .. future son-in-law directly to her own farm house. Poor Anu. This is not her fault. I came here to apologize to Anu.. ..and to find a way to convince my mother-in-law. But when I got here, I understood that.. ..I have another job to do before that. I have to mend their bond. Great, son-in-law. Sir!? Does that mean you have accepted my boss as your son-in-law? - Almost. - Thank you. - Don't mention. - I don't think mentioning this will make any difference. Sir needs to prove that he is fit to be Shailja Reddy ma'am's son-in-law. At present that's not important for me. I want to restore their good relationship. And that's why I want Anu to do all that her mom loves. I want Anu's mom to remember the love she has for Anu. Good! Black day, I mean our anniversary is in two days. Make use of that occasion. - Aishwarya! - Yes, madam. What's going on here? Happy 25th wedding anniversary, ma'am. Thank you. Okay, ladies first. - Take it. - Thank you. Who told you? Was it Manikyam? Manikyam? He doesn't even remember his birthday. He saw us decorating the house in the morning.. ..and asked if today is a festival. Then we had to tell him that today is your wedding anniversary. Oh! Then who told you? Who else? Your one and only very beautiful daughter. Arrogant Goddess, egoistical princess. ..an heir to Shailaja Reddy's wealth and fame but also to her beauty and grace. Anu told us. What else did she tell you? A lot. She said that she owes her life to you both. She said that she is alive and happy today only because of you both. And that's why she wants to celebrate your anniversary more than you. She said that the celebrations should last at least 3 days. She even woke up at 3 in the morning and prepared a feast for you, ma'am. I can't believe my daughter spoke so maturely. - Did she really behave so well? - I swear, ma'am. Yes, Shailaja. The Anu we saw five years ago is completely different.. ..from the Anu that I see today. Even I couldn't believe my own eyes. You will know exactly what you're missing out on.. ..if you talk to her once. You've already missed a lot, Shailaja. Why don't you talk to her once? Please, ma'am. Talk to her once. - Okay, let's go have lunch. - Okay. Doctor! - Me? - Yes, you. - I've been on liquid diet since yesterday. - Okay. Now constipation turned into diarrhea. Since you're got your pen, I thought you could heal me. - Definitely. - Please. - But you cannot do it here. - Then where? Go to your room and sit in landing position. Start your job and twist 22 times and shake 36 times. This will permanently stop the process. We cannot reverse this even if you beg me. No need, sir. Doing this everyday is quite boring. That's true. - You are a God, sir. - You are too kind. My pen please. Hello?! Sorry, here it is. Thank you. Venu, why did you wait for me? I thought I'd have lunch with you today. I wasn't asking you. - Aishwarya! - Yes, madam. - Where is Manikyam? - I just saw him running out. - Keep it on the table. - He's went to check on some leakage problem. I can manage if you need to say something to Anu. Let the manager do his job. You can start eating. Manikyam is calling me from the pump set. Hello, Manikyam. I am sitting in landing position just as you told me. And panic.. 'Pranic healing not panic.' Yes, whatever. I can come out if you can heal me with your pen. Yes, Manikyam. Ma'am wants to speak to you. Hold on. Pass the phone, please. Manikyam, ma'am. Why is he giving the phone to her? Talking to her might make my problem worse. - Yes, madam. - Where are you? Water from our fields was overflowing, madam. I came here to build a dam. You can take care of that later. I need you here. Madam, not everything takes place when we want it. Some things happen at their own time. Do you need to speak to your daughter, madam? I can put her on conference call if you want. One minute, ma'am. It's Manikyam, take the call. - Hello? - Ma'am is on line. Manikyam, do you really need to wake up so early do this all by yourself? Our cook could have made everything if you told him. Madam, if this is not an urgent matter.. ..can we discuss this when I get home? Manikyam today is my parents' wedding anniversary. That's why I prepared everything as per my taste. Manikyam, I know you cannot cook so many meat dishes. How did you manage all this? Madam, please, I need a favor. If Chari sir is sitting beside you, and if he's got his pen.. ..can you please ask him to stop the water with it? Manikyam, stop talking nonsense. I made this special dish myself. Taste it. It is tasty, Manikyam. But I think it is quite spicy.. Water! Water! Water? Do you need water? Don't worry, madam. I'll get water for you. This faucet is not working. This bucket is empty too. Slowly. Slowly. Anu, tell her to eat this sweet. Tell her. Say it. Has the burning reduced, Manikyam? What can I say, madam? It is quite impossible to express how I feel. I can see all colors. It's a colorful pain. How are you feeling now, Manikyam? We have so many people working in the kitchen. Why didn't anyone tell her when she was adding so much chili powder to the food? Dad, it wasn't their fault. I added more even when they tried to warn me. I am sorry. Anu! Ma'am, I don't think she ever stepped into kitchen before. She cooked something for the first time. I am sure it was to surprise you. You ate the spicy dish, and yet she had tears in her eyes. Why else would that happen if not for love? Maybe you should talk to her once. That will console her. Please. Venu, I asked them to make arrangements.. ..for the special prayers in temple tomorrow. Please take care of those. Dad, what's this for? Your mom has arranged for these special prayers.. ..wishing that you'd find a good husband that you should get married.. ..and more importantly that you should listen to her. Will I find a good husband and get married just by doing special prayers? That's because she has no idea that you are.. ..already engaged and your fiance is standing right here. I will translate it for madam if you can speak louder. No, thanks. I don't need a translator. I can very well talk to my daughter without your help. Venu, what's your problem with Manikyam? We're in a temple, please behave. Greetings. You need to whisper this hymn thrice in your daughter's ears. After hearing that, she needs to feed the cow with this rice.. Stop. Don't ask me to do impossible things. Please, ma'am. You will see great results.. ..if you follow what the priest says. Your daughter will be obedient from now on. Priest, is it possible to conduct these prayers in a different way? I don't think I can change the method just for you.. - Manikyam! - Yes, madam. 'Looks like they're not willing to talk to each other even if God tells them.' [Chanting mantras in Sanskrit] Sorry, madam. I cannot even pronounce high sounding words. Great! Chanting mantras would be like going through hell for me. It sounds so complicated and ancient. It would bring bad luck if I pronounce them wrong. I wouldn't want that, madam. If you don't mind, can you please.. ..talk to her directly just this one time? She is standing right next to you. - Manikyam! - Yes, sir. - Go back. - Okay. Go back. Ma'am, think of me as Manikyam just this once. Say it in my ear and I will whisper it in hers. Anu, close your eyes, come on. Its okay, ma'am, I don't mind. I will chant it as it is. Don't worry. Just give me one chance. Please trust me. Close your eyes. Go ahead, ma'am. [Chanting mantras in Sanskrit] I can't hear properly. Can you please come closer? A little closer, thanks. - Anu, are you happy? - A lot. This is the best time. Give this holy offering to your mom as soon as she comes out of the temple. No one refuses holy offering even from an enemy. Will she talk to me if I give her this? At least Manikyam will be out of the picture. Something will work out at some point of time.. ..and you two will start talking to each other. Okay? Try it. They are coming. Venu, tell driver to get the car. Holy offering. Anu is giving you holy offering. - Take it. - Manikyam! Yes, madam. Please give that to me, I will give her. I'm giving it to you. Are you taking it or not? What's this strange behavior, Manikyam? You never did this before, why now? That's why I am giving you now. Take it. Take it. You know me well. I don't forget the past so easily. Ma'am, this is no time to get upset. She's just giving you holy offering. Please take it. Stay out of it. Why are you being so adamant.. .. even when I'm willing to swallow my pride? Nonsense. Manikyam, who is she threatening? Hey, don't throw. That's holy. Anu! Anu! Does she think she can get close to me.. ..by acting so arrogantly? - Move aside. - Ma'am! Ma'am, please. Shailaja Reddy's son-in-law, Chaitu! They haven't been talking to each other for five years.. ..for a very small reason. Do you think you could mend their bond.. ..just by making her do things that her mother likes? Never! Ego percentage is higher in both of them than love. You and your love are sure to be crushed.. ..between that mother and daughter. Mark my words. Hi, Chaitu! How are you? I am fine, how about you? I am good. What are you doing there? Me? Nothing much. Just trying to look after wedding arrangements. You should be ashamed of yourself. A brother is supposed to wait till his sister is married. My sweet little sister. I am not even sure if we will be able to get married. How does it matter who gets married first? And you still need to find a man you love. I found him already. I met him when he came home with a marriage proposal. Talk to him. What? She is super fast. Hello? Hello, Chaitanya. How are you? You are fast, dude. We are counting on you to get us married. Please. Fine, but go and meet my dad first. He will yell at you, don't react. Shamelessly go back to him next week. He will yell at you again, don't react. He will then calm down a little. Request him to reconsider his decision. His ego will be satisfied and he will feel pity for you. 'Are you sure your dad will give his consent?' I don't know about that. But I'll take care of the rest. That assurance is enough for me. Thank you. Thank you very much. Okay, bye. Take care. Crazy people, right? I didn't expect them go ahead so fast. Do you know how much I appreciate all that you do.. ..to make things work out for us and for your sister? Anu! Someone may see us. So what? What if your mother finds out? So what? Hi. You wanted to see me ma'am? How does he look? He is handsome. Any problem? No, he has no problems. Anu is the problem. He's a doctor. He's very interested in marrying Anu. He's from a very good family. I don't want to lose such a nice guy. I've already told Anu about him, but she refused. I don't want to ask her again. I don't know what I'll do if she refuses again. 'I can't help you in this matter. Sorry.' Oh, sorry ma'am. One minute. Sorry ma'am. Hello? Chaitu, what is today's date? 18th. Did you call me up just to ask this? No, to remind you. I want you to get married on the date I announced. That means we have just one week. Go that way! Forget about Shailaja if you cannot convince her. I know how to get you married. Come back. Okay, dad. Consider it done. Just give me some time. That's what we don't have, son. Time is flying. You have to get married, at least for me if not for you. And it has to happen on the day I fixed. That's it. Okay, dad. Sure. It'll be done. Who was it? My dad. There's a wedding on the 25th. He wants me to be there. Oh! Won't you be here for your friend's engagement? My friend? Who is it ma'am? Your friend Anu. We've arranged for her engagement on the 25th. But she hasn't agreed. That's what you need to do. I feel that she will consider your opinion as her friend.. .. rather than her parents decision. But I know how to convince her in case she refuses. Talk to her. Such a cool breeze. But you're in no position to enjoy it. You have to marry Anu to satisfy your dad's ego. And you have to mend Anu's relationship with her mom.. ..if you have to satisfy her ego. And if you have to satisfy her mother's ego.. ..you'll have to convince Anu to marry the guy her mother chose for her. I pray that no lover goes through this situation, boss. Tell me, boss. What is your plan? How can I help? Should I go to your wedding on the 25th and welcome all the guests? Or should I attend Anu's engagement party as a guest on the same day? What's it to be, boss? I'm at your service. I'm your Swiggy. My brain is all numb, Chari. I need to talk to Anu immediately if you need answers for all your questions. Then call her and wake her up, boss. I've been trying. But her phone is switched off. She is conscious of radiation I guess. I've got an idea, boss. Let's cut the electricity so that you can go into her room.. ..and explain the whole situation to her. Okay? I am sure this is Anu's room. Chari! That is mother-in-law's room. That is Anu's. Go ahead and get it done. I mean talk to her. Why did she run into that room? - I don't know. - What did you do? I made smooching noise. No wonder she was scared. - Go and call her. - Me? Yes, you. - Go, get inside. - Okay, sir. My room is stuffy. Please forgive me, ma'am. I'm doing this for my boss. Doctor, liquid diet has turned my life into hell. It's almost midnight and I'm stuck in toilet. Please heal me and stop this. I beg of you. Oh, God! Why is he squeaking like a rat when I'm telling him about my problem? What's wrong with you? I came and sat here hoping that you'd help. Why are you disconnecting my call? The other day you were with madam. At least now we are alone, right? Do something. 'Do you have any idea what a horrible condition I'm in?' It's a natural disaster. I beg of you, doctor. I will cooperate with whatever you tell me. Just use the healing pen and stop my problem. Please, stop it, stop it. He has switched off his phone. What do I do now? He's taking me for granted. I'll have to go find him wherever he is. What is it? You're disturbing me with all this noise. Sleep now or I'll go away to that room. They don't even let me sleep peacefully. What's with these secret meetings? Why did you come here so late at night? Not getting sleep? I've got no time to think of romance.. ..with all these problems you've created for me. Come with me. I need to find a solution to my diarrhea right now. Why is she covering herself when she is feeling stuffy? Such a stubborn girl. There's no way I'm going to let her win. What's wrong with her? Why is she running in and out of rooms so late at night? God, please help me! Show some mercy! You! I don't understand what you're up to? Are you really a healer? Will you heal me or not? Don't forget that you're able to stay here only on my recommendation. This isn't a good time. My tummy doesn't know what's a good time and what's not. I don't have any peace. Doesn't even let me sleep. My problem is getting worse. I can't take it anymore. Manikyam! Manikyam! Healing may not work on some problems.. ..but will power surely will. We may not find happiness in winning.. - ..but there's more joy in helping others win. - Exactly! I've read many WhatsApp messages like this.. ..when people forward them to me.. ..along with God's photo and good morning wishes. Don't provoke me by giving me such stupid examples. I'm going through hell! Manikyam! Manikyam! - Here, keep this pen with you. - What's this for? This is not a Pranic healing pen, it's a self-healing pen. - Bend down. - Bend? Start rotating. Keep doing that. - Manikyam! - Yes, madam. What are you doing here so late at night? I'm trying a self-healing method, madam. How can I help you? I think Anu went out. Come and help me find her. I wonder where she is. - Did you hear that noise? - Yes, madam. Good morning, ma'am. What are you doing here at this hour? I misplaced my healing pen, ma'am. I was looking for it. Usually my U.S. clients call me at this time. Oh, I see that you have it. Thank you, sir. - This is the pen, ma'am. - Forget about U.S. clients. - You should satisfy Indian clients first. - A dollar is equal to 71.. Ma'am! What's wrong with him? What happened, Chari? Why are you standing here alone? Alone? I thought we're four people, ma'am. Oh! I get it. Why are you standing here all by yourself, madam? I came out for some fresh air. You can go inside. She's here for some fresh air, ma'am. You can go inside. Whatever! Why are you still standing here? Go and find out why there's a power cut. Okay, madam. Why did you want to meet at this time, Chaitu? We had a narrow escape. Anu, situation is very serious right now. Your mother didn't bring you here for the temple festival. She brought you here to get you married.. ..to the son of this farmhouse owner. So, what do we do now? Anu, someone has to let go of their ego in this situation. Or this may never end. Please talk to her tomorrow and apologize to her. Say that you're sorry for what happened. Maybe she'll see that you realized your mistake.. ..and start talking to you again. At least then we'll have a chance to tell her about us. Then I'll know how to convince her. Trust me on this. I appreciate you trying to help us. But I'll never apologize when I'm not at fault. - Move aside! - Anu! She didn't even touch your father's feet when he refused to give his consent. Why would she apologize to her mother? Don't be physical, boss. Be practical. Take my advice. Don't depend on her. Do what you have to do and trust in Goddess to help. If only you had followed my plan.. What are you talking about, Chari? Actually, he was talking about you, ma'am. He was telling me what Anu said. What did she say? Do we really need to discuss this now, boss? It's okay. This is just about her mother. She said that she was born because you offered prayers here. Oh, does she remember that even now? Of course, ma'am. She's praying that you both should start talking again.. ..and that she'll roll around this temple in wet clothes.. ..if God fulfills her wish right now. Why doesn't she talk to me directly and apologize.. ..instead of doing all this? She's all ready to do what you want of her.. ..if you're willing to do something for her. Yes, ma'am. She's ready to marry the guy you chose and make you win. Ma'am, everyone says that you display nothing but love in this temple. If that is true, show her love as a mother.. ..in the presence of our Mother Goddess. Go and talk to her, please. Fine, if your ego is stopping you from that.. ..you could at least send her a message. 'Anu, I want to talk to you.' Then she will come straight to you. Either way, you will be the winner, ma'am. Just imagine how wonderful it will be to talk to Anu again. You should send her a message.. ..at least to get her to agree to this marriage. Listen to me. Boss! Chaitu, mom wants to talk to me. She just messaged me. Only you made this possible. Thank you so much. Anu! Anu! This is me, Chaitu. Your mother is over there. Yes, over there. Why hug me thinking that I'm your mother? Your mom is standing right there. - Go. - See, ma'am. Just the thought of you talking to her again.. ..made her so happy that she didn't realize.. ..who she was hugging her best friend. That's the power of mother and daughter relationship. Anu, don't waste any more time. Go and talk to her directly. Amazing performance! First of all, you all entered the scene at the wrong time. And you don't even have the right dialogues. Who are you anyway? Come here, son. I would have been his relative if his sister had married my son. That didn't happen. So, what are you doing here? I'm here for Mrs. Shailaja Reddy, not for you. Me? What for? He and your daughter Anu are in deep love. They got engaged without even telling you. His father went to the point of fixing their wedding date. He even announced that it is on the 25th of this month. Hey! Do you have any idea who you're talking to? I know that you don't believe such stories, madam. That's why I came here with evidence. Please look at this. And everyone standing here, including your husband.. .. knows about this except you, madam. Tell her. Speak up. Yes, sister. Anu threatened to kill herself if we told you. That's why.. Ma'am, I can explain. Please let me.. You! You! I'm sparing your life just because my daughter is at fault too. Or I would have buried you alive. I'm giving you half an hour. I will kill you if I see you in this village after that. I thought you were my family! Shailaja, just hear me out.. I don't want to hear anything. She has no respect for me as her mother. What's the point of getting upset with her? She doesn't even remember that I'm her mother. It will be a waste of time to yell at her. I knew my daughter was proud. But I underestimated her anger. I can tell how angry she was with me.. ..by the fact that she not only fell in love with a guy.. ..but also went to the point of engagement. I stopped talking to her five years ago.. ..because she insulted me in front of everyone. Now she got engaged to a guy without telling me.. ..and cheated me by presenting him as a doctor. Will she keep cheating all my life? Everyone thinks that Shailaja Reddy.. ..is known for keeping her enemies under control. But she made me feel that my own daughter has turned into my enemy. Shailaja, I never questioned your decisions before. Listen to me just this once. She is your daughter, she will never do anything wrong. Just think about her. She loves you as much as you love her. If she loves me and respects me as you say tell her to do what I want. She spent five years away from me just to study the subject she liked. Ask her to marry the guy I chose.. ..and stay with me forever. - How is that possible? - Venu! Mrs. Shailaja Reddy! How are you? I've been looking for this opportunity for four weeks now. I wanted to get you when you're alone. Finally I got you! Do you know something? I even killed my own mother because she objected to my keeping a mistress. Did you think I'd spare you? How dare you get me thrashed by women? Who'll stop me now? I will kill you and cut you into pieces! Hey! You're a coward who waited to find me alone. Come! Try to kill me! I'll see how brave you are! Come on! Don't get excited unnecessarily. Both you and I will benefit if she dies. Hey! I didn't come to this village for my benefit. I came here because I promised Anu that I'd be there for her whenever.. ..she faces any problem in life. Then you'll die too! Mother! Anu! Anu! Give her some water. I don't need any. I wasn't giving you. Shailaja! What happened to your hand? Where is Manikyam? - Manikyam.. - Dad, where is Manikyam? Where is Manikyam? What? Are you going to start again? I've never seen a mother and daughter like you. Would there be people like you on earth? You have great love just for name's sake. But somehow ego and pride and takes over.. ..whenever you have to express that love. You can cook n number of dishes for your mom. But refuse to apologize to her. You buy a diamond necklace for your daughter and keep it in her cupboard. But you'd never put it around her neck affectionately. How are you going to display the love in your heart.. ..if you are never going to express your feelings? Bringing in a third person in your relationship.. ..will only make you distant, not bring you closer. If you noticed your daughter being proud.. ..will she not change if you try to correct her? Who can teach a child better than her mother? Are you really not capable of starting a hospital on your own? Why do you want your daughter to do it? Fine, imagine she became a doctor and.. ..started running a hospital for your sake. She will definitely kill people. Do you really think she has what it takes to save people? Don't you know how you've raised her? And that's why I don't want her. I thought she had changed a lot after she loved me. But, no. I understood after I came here.. ..that she's not been speaking to her own mother for the last five years. How can a woman respect her husband.. ..if she cannot even respect her mother? How can a mother-in-law value her son-in-law.. ..when she doesn't even respect her husband? I've been enduring my dad for the last 20 years. He's the most egoistical man I've know. That's all I can bear. He ruined my sister's life with his ego. I see how painful it is for her. I don't think I can go through that kind of pain. Just one more thing. You may turn your daughter's life into hell because of me. Please don't do that. You feel for the women who suffer. Don't see your daughter in Anu and hate her. Maybe she forgot that she is a woman too. Remind her of that and mend your relationship. Please. Hello? Did you think you can live peacefully after you raise a fire in my home? What nonsense? Who is this? Just the fact that you're asking who I am in spite of knowing who I am.. ..proves that you are truly egoistical as your son said. Come here. Your daughter is with me. Hey! Where is Shanti? Where is Shanti? Stop yelling! I told you she's with me. You got my daughter engaged without my knowledge. But I am informing you that I am going to.. .. get your daughter married to the guy you hate. Wedding is in an hour. I heard that you've got a huge ego like me. I want to know how huge it is. Come and stop the wedding if you're man enough. What's this? I didn't give you that information.. - ..so that you can get his daughter married to my son. - Dad! I wanted you to break his bones because his father rejected my son. You should focus on that. Come on, son. - But, dad.. - Let's go! Where do you think you're going? You need to take my sister's permission. Go back! What's this, madam? You cannot threaten us like this. Do you know who I am? I'm sorry, dad. Why are you saying sorry when she hit him? Sir, I think your son has something to do with this. Look at him! Ma'am, Chaitu's father was the one who forced Anu to get engaged that day. Chaitu wasn't at fault. And that happened because my dad provoked his dad. If everything had gone according to our plans.. ..I would have been married to Chaitu's sister by now. And I would've come to you to talk about their marriage.. ..and not to request your help in this matter. I hope you understand. How long are you going to look at each other like lovers? Flashback is over. Hello? Chaitu, what did you tell me and what did you do? You were supposed to get Shailaja Reddy's consent.. ..for your marriage with Anu. But you provoked her to get Shanti married. Why did you create problems for me to solve yours? Dad, I didn't ask her to get Shanti here. In fact, I am happy that she is doing this.. ..just because I said those things to her. Maybe God willed that my sister is to be married.. ..under the guidance of Mrs. Shailaja Reddy. I think that's why Anu came into my life. Hey! Don't make stupid assertions. I will kill you! Fine. But I will give my full support for the wedding. But I won't be here as her brother. I will take your position as her father.. .. wash the groom's feet and give her away. - Understood? - Hey! Dad, yelling from there won't stop the wedding. Come here and show us what you can do. What happened? Your daughter is getting married. Okay, let me get dressed. - Hi, mom! - Dear, it's our son-in-law. - Hello, father-in-law. - He is wishing you. - Hi, dad. - Show that to me. Hey, my phone! It's gone! Stop it! - How dare you.. - Dad, stop it! Leave him. - But it's our daughter's.. - Shut up! She would never do that. It's his fault! This is his doing! Come on! He is solely responsible for all these problems. - I will kill you! How dare you.. - Leave him! Do you realize where you are and what you're doing? He is my son-in-law! What? Do you know who I am? I don't care who you are! Once you enter this village no one is above me. Your words and your actions should be under my control.. ..as long as I am around. Remember that! First listen to what I have to say. I wanted to kill you when I heard about.. ..how you forced my daughter to get engaged. But your son made that look positive.. .. and tried to convince me to agree to their marriage. But do you think he gave his consent? Shiva, they should be married before their father gets here. Take them away. I won't agree to that. I was okay with them getting married.. ..but I would never want that to happen.. ..without my parents present here. What? But you just yelled at your dad. That was because I wanted him to get there.. ..so that I can convince him to give his approval. But, I don't mean to hurt my parents. If that is all I cared for.. ..I would have married her long back without telling you.. ..and got my sister married without telling my parents. I wouldn't waste so much time in trying to.. ..either convince you or my dad. Child's marriage is a festival for parents. They get to experience that only once in life. It should take place in their presence.. ..and we need to convince our parents to give their approval. We have no rights to take that away from them. That is the least we can do to show them respect. They deserve that joy for being our parents. So, tell me now. Would any father lose a son like him? I wanted to get his sister married.. ..just so that I can make him my son-in-law. We parents took away our children's love.. ..just because we couldn't let go of our ego. But they proved that they want to be with us.. ..and that they love us. It's not too late. We will start the wedding rituals.. ..only if you and mom give your approval. Yes, dad. We can leave right now if you don't like this. Come on, dad. I didn't want to see tears in your eyes. All I want is to see a smile. We will be the most fortunate children.. ..if you would just accept us with a smile on your face. I am sorry. I made a mistake with regard to your daughter. There's no need for that. Family doesn't keep count of mistakes. Would you mind if we get them married too? Will you accept her as your daughter-in-law? No. I want you to accept my son as your son-in-law. Please. I don't get it. Either he is a villain or a comedian. He can be very positive when he likes others. Please. It's enough for you to agree. She is as egoistical as ever. I don't want her. Don't be silly. I'm sure she can change if we can change. Anu, why are you still standing there? Go and get dressed.
