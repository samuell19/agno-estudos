RAZMASCHKINA PRODUCER MIKHAIL KOSTYUKOVSKIY Can you be serious? I can't. That's enough, honey. Stand stiII for a moment. Fine, as you wish. Like that. A IittIe bit to the right. Tanya, do you know where is right and where is Ieft? Stand straight, Tanya. I can't. The Iight is too bright. Have patience. Is it OK? Yes? And divine back of my head. Excuse me, my profiIe. I don't understand what's the difference? Can you be serious? I can. Here you go. OK. Tanya, a IittIe bit to the right. It's fine. OK, OK, Tanya, that's enough. I moved to the right. Mitenka. Mitenka. Tanechka. Who came out to meet us? Bearded beast. HeIIo, Tanechka. HeIIo, heIIo. Who is it? It was a man. Look who I've brought you. HeIIo, heIIo, prince AIeksey. I bow to you, I bow to you. How is tsar of Moscow doing? WeII boyar, he's weII. WeII, you say. He's weII. Let's shake hands. Let's shake. Kiss. Like this. How are you here? What have you had today? As usuaI, caviar. Caviar that's good. It's tasty. HeIp an iII oId woman. Guys, I'm very gIad that you've came. Mitenka, you Iook wonderfuI. Your face is aII red. Fresh air. And what prevents you from breathing fresh air? Let's go, I'II show you where to settIe down. He aIso must breathe fresh air. Where wiII we Iive? At my pIace, guys. It's very good, Mitenka. If I had known, I wouIdn't have come. You'II Iive at my pIace and I'II Iive at hoteI. We'II Iive here with pIeasure. Did I wash the fIoors? No, I had no time. I'II do it myseIf. But I cauIked up the windows. Is it coId here? No, but you'II be comfortabIe. What can I teII you? It's hard. What is hard for you? She'II have graduation party. Pushkin Iived in this house; Pushkin was friends with Vyazemskiy, ...grieved, Iied in bed and said that he had caught coId. Mitya, Lyosha taIks about Pushkin for days together. Pushkin, Pushkin... Stop being sarcastic. I say nothing. Mitenka, you spend with this Pushkin aII the time. Go. WonderfuI. Stop. OK. Swinging. Now breaking. It breaks, it can't endure. It breaks. That's aII. Lie down, Lenochka. Pushkin takes papers. ChoIera crawIs away. OK, stop Iaughing, girIs. You agreed to heIp us. Now get up, choIera gets up. Pushkin writes Ietters. He can't get to Petersburg. He feeIs unbearabIe anguish because of NataIy. He writes a Ietter. There is a muse beside him. She communicates psychoIogicaI condition, his mood and poet's thoughts. That's why her movements are so adroit and Iingering. Oksana, your movements must be more diverse. These are miIestones. Now Pushkin's Ietters wiII be passed. Oksana is a student on a facuIty of Iight industry. Muse is a future architect. She's a sixth-year student. Misha pIays Pushkin. He'II go to the army. OIenka pIays NataIy. She goes to the musicaI schooI. Fan yourseIf, fan yourseIf. Of coarse this scene takes pIace in Pushkin's imagination... Do you seriousIy think that I'm going to Iive here? What? Tanya, what do you mean? Do you seriousIy think that I'm going to sIeep here? I don't understand what you are saying. Don't you understand? Do you think that it's possibIe to Iive here? Tanya, stop. What are you taIking about? You don't understand, do you? You think that everything's OK. How are we going to wash ourseIves? Bedbugs, cockroaches... What is it? How do you imagine it? I must go to the bathroom outside, mustn't I? What is it with you? What are you taIking about? You don't understand, do you? I don't...You don't understand. What is it with you, Tanya? You don't understand what is it with me? Stupid. You're stupid. I tricked you. You are an actress. You beIieved me. I pIayed up. Aren't you ashamed? Who do you take me for? I'm carpenter, painter and director in one person. Do they give you money? We have, but there are not enough peopIe. We must reconstruct this house. And by the way there was a church here. Who did you specificaIIy turn to? To regionaI committee and other authorities. Did regionaI committee heIp? Let's taIk seriousIy about everything. Mitya, Mitya...Tanya, wait. Don't Iisten to him. You aIready have grey hairs in your beard. You're oId. You too have gray hairs. They'II disappear tiII tomorrow. Do you remember we met a man in regionaI committee? Let's not taIk about it. I'II go and taIk to him. I can do it. Let's sit and taIk about it. He'II teach you how to Iive. ReaIIy? That's enough.You must Iisten to me. What do you need? Dmitriy Fedorovich! I'm coming. I must know what to ask him for. Mitya, don't Iisten to him. I'II come. Come to our home. We'II sit and taIk. So we agreed. You'II see how we settIed. She can cook nothing except omeIet. It's not true. I'II eat omeIet with pIeasure. OK, we'II meet,discuss it. Then we'II write it down, think it over. See you. Pushkin is nationaI and maybe worId-wide phenomenon. Of course we must put a Iot of work into it, money and work. PeopIe are working here wonderfuIIy and seIfIessIy. But you understand that it is not enough three charwomen for this entire park. It was aII arranged weII in MikhaIovskoe. For exampIe, we can buiId a hoteI here, construct some roads. We may organize here festivaI and Pushkin's recitation, pIays. This is Iiterary Mecca. The whoIe period of Pushkin's creative work took pIace at Budino. There are enough probIems for us, scientists, for every meeting. Of course if we taIk about common economic probIems we want to have good access roads, good hoteI. But I repeat that it isn't the main thing for us. But it is the main thing for us. This manor was opened in 1929. And it was decided to open it as a museum on country meeting in 1918. Boy! By the way that Iarch was pIanted by AIeksandr Sergeevich himseIf in 1833. Boy? Come back, pIease. Liosha. Come here. What? I wanted to teII you something. What is it? You know, it's quite a story. What is it? Kiss me. ...under the circumstances... Yes, yes, of course. This period... Yes, I agree. This circumstances determined... Yes, yes. BoIdino period of course. You must pay attention... Of course it's saturated with that atmosphere to present day... But if I sit here I won't write anything. Yes, you won't write anything. Tanya, you'II be transIating. OK? Yes, for us to understand something. Because my French... Monsieur D'Ardie! Good day! Good day, Monsieur D'Ardie! Is it your new hobby? Are these your first pictures, monsieur D'Ardie? Do you remember us? Good day! Good day. A photo for us. Yes, a happy famiIy. It's wonderfuI. I'm pIeased. Thank you, thank you. How are you? Very weII. And you? How do you do? WeII. Very weII. Good day. Good day. You are beautifuI as aIways. Thank you. You know, he's impressed. He Iikes everything here. I think that everyone who is devoted to Russian Iiterature must come to BoIdino. At our country Pushkin is caIIed the sun of Russian poetry. And Dantes is a bIack cIoud against a background of this sun. BeautifuI. A photo of you two together. Another photo? photo-kiss... The greater is my interest in Russian poetry the greater is my hatred for Dantes. What he has to do with aII this? O my God! What is it? Excuse me, pIease. I beg your pardon, but I unwittingIy overheard your conversation... to aII appearances about Pushkin's admirers. I'm a journaIist to aII appearances. What is it? Nothing. You just taIked about Dantes and I... Everything is aIways cIear 100 years Iater. Let's get back to Dantes. A young man came to Russia and met a beautifuI young woman. He feII in Iove. Stop it. It's aII right. Let's go farther. Pushkin who was 23 years oId came to Odessa, met a beautifuI young woman. I mean Voronzova. He feII in Iove. And imagine yourseIf such situation: Voronzov wouId have chaIIenged Pushkin to a dueI. WeII? And Pushkin wouId have found himseIf in situation of Dantes. The same passion. Isn't it the same? Of course you've read his Don-Juan's Iist. Yes, we've read it, but we've found out other things. Lyosha, Iet's go. You know, Vyazemskiy was very sorry that Byron's notes disappeared. ''To heII with them!'' Pushkin said. Thank God that they disappeared. PeopIe read confession with greed because they are pIeased of their own baseness, of humiIiation of the subIime. He's smaII-minded Iike us, he's fouI Iike us. You're Iying. Yes? Yes, he's smaII-minded and fouI but he is not Iike you. He's other. Do you think so? I'm sure. Than I'm sorry. WeII, weII. I see. Give it to me. Don't be greedy. Give it to me. She feII in Iove with him for his greediness and he didn't give her a bun. She was hungry? ''There're marveIs there: the wood-spite roams, Midst branches shines the mermaids taiI; ''There are the strangest creatures' traces On the mysterious paths and moors.... ...There visions fiII a vaIe and forest; There, at a dawn, come waves, the coIdest, On the deserted sandy shore, And thirty knights, in armors shone, Come out the cIear waves in a coIon...'' What have you done?! It was just a joke. Did I scare you? Of course you scared me! You're a grown man but you behave Iike a chiId. And you bit my neck. Let me go! You bit off haIf of my neck. Don't touch me! I don't want to! ReaIIy? Let me go! Have you prayed tonight, Desdemona? Have you prayed tonight? Yes! ''It was bad autumn evening and she went far away. And she heId in trembIing arms a secret fruit of unhappy Iove. It was quiet in forest and in mountains. Everything sIept in night twiIight. She Iooked around carefuIIy and with terror. Then she Iooked at innocent baby: you sIeep, my chiId of torment... ...Unjust and horribIe Iaw dooms us to suffering. WhiIe years didn't took your Iight-hearted youth, sIeep, my sweet. Bitter grief won't take away your chiIdhood. But suddenIy moon Iighted hut behind a bosket. Excited she took her son and came cIoser. She bent carefuIIy and the baby to a strange threshoId. With fear she Iooked away and disappeared in siIence of the night. O, thank you. Thank you, AIeksandra VasiIievna. It was great, thank you. What is it? What is it? Come on. Tanya, what is it? Stop it. Stop it, Tanya. It's very exciting. You feeI Iike Pushkin is aIive and now he'II come from round the corner. You think what you'II say to him, what you'II do. Did you write something here? No, I didn't write anything. But before I came here I created a few Iines. I wanted to appIy his wonderfuI poem ''Guard me, my taIisman'' to actuaI myseIf, to have something in common with it. I wrote a few Iines and understood that I had just copied him. And Iike every reiteration it was of IittIe vaIue. WeII, a coupIe of Iines have Ieft. I've remembered something. It goes Iike this. I didn't think that Iife was divided on cIear day and mist. WhiIe not aII is Iost, guard me, my taIisman. Using other rights Iet me repeat after you: guard me, my taIisman. EviI truth or Iies insinuatingIy creep into our souIs. WhiIe not aII is Iost, guard me, my taIisman. Using other rights Iet me repeat after you: guard me, my taIisman. Thank you. Did you write music for it? No, I have no music right now. It doesn't come out yet. And maybe it'II never come out. ''We aII meandered through our schooIing ...Haphazard; so, to God be thanks, ...It's easy, without too much fooIing, Onegin was assessed by many ...To pass for cuItured in our ranks... As weII-read, though of pedant cast. Pedant? Unforced, as conversation passed, He had the taIent of... Be quiet. Hmm.. La Ia Ia... Excuse me. Sorry, I foIIow you everywhere. There on the bridge I said a Iot of things. Excuse me, pIease. I think that we had enough conversations. Yes, of course. You are right, of course. And Pushkin's phrase is just wonderfuI. Sorry. It's fine. PIease. KIimov AnatoIiy Evgenievich. Dmitriev AIeksey Petrovich. You may caII me AnatoIiy. OK. Tanya. PIeased to meet you. I'II go away. I don't want to disturb you. No, you don't disturb us at aII. You know, I've seen you somewhere. OnIy I can't remember where. Isn't it, Lyosha? CouId I see on TV? Stop it. Lyosha, I've reaIIy seen him. Tanya. Tanyusha, come here. Mitenka, my good friend. AnatoIiy. Yes? You see, AnatoIiy, AIeksandr AIeksandrovich BIock said wonderfuI words: Pushkin was kiIIed not by the Dantes' buIIet; he was kiIIed by Iack of air. Do you understand? Even if Voronzov wouId have chaIIenged Pushkin to a dueI and didn't write report to Petersburg, even in this case Pushkin couIdn't have found himseIf in situation of Dantes. Pushkin who took part in few dueIs never kiIIed anybody. And he even didn't wound anybody. Akhamatova said piercing words. Sorry that I quote aII the time. It's fine. Can you imagine such picture: mortaIIy wounded Dantes is carried in one coach ...in one coach and there is absoIuteIy sound Pushkin? It's unimaginabIe. Yes, it's interesting. It's nothing. Let me give you a book. ''Pushkin in year 1936'' is a wonderfuI book. But with one condition. I appreciate it. I Iive in the house of museum director. There, behind the fence. OK, You may come at any time. But you'II return it. Yes. I'II come. And now I'II go if you don't mind. I heard a Iot of things here. I have to think it over. Never mind, never mind. Thank you, thank you. Yes. We can't pIay GogoI; we can't pIay Pushkin... We can't pIay them in iIIustrative fiIm that you're taIking about. No, you mean that iIIustrative is bad. And I'm saying... Graphic fiIm. I'm saying... SimpIe man untiI he isn't decIared genius and whiIe he's just Iike everybody eIse. Do I make myseIf cIear? TeII about simpIe man, about fate, pain and joy. How can we pIay genius? How can we, simpIe peopIe, pIay genius? You shouIdn't pIay genius. You shouId pIay a man who became a genius as a resuIt. I don't know how. For someone he became a genius. We know it... Was Van Gogh a genius for his generation? And Gauguin? They died in poverty. How can we pIay? It doesn't matter. They had very rich Iives. It's true. Why are you convincing me? You want to pIay. And I won't pIay it. I won't even stage it. I'm not an idiot. I suppose there is a man who can do it. There is a difference between simpIe man and genius. There is a difference. That's it. This difference is posthumous. Of course. Without any doubt. Life of Dantes who kiIIed AIeksandr Sergeevich is aIso mysterious. Can you pIay him? I don't know... WeII, Dantes is an accidentaI figure. And nevertheIess Pushkin is Pushkin. Without any doubt. But for those times. And for those times too. Pushkin was definite figure for society. And Dantes is an accidentaI phenomenon and strange character. Of course he was interesting. You ask if we can make a fiIm about him beyond Pushkin. I have an idea. I don't know if it possibIe. We couId make fiIm about Iast days of Pushkin. AII events shouId take pIace in Dantes' apartment. We couId see what happens there without Pushkin. Approach of BuIgakov. Not reaIIy. BuIgakov described events in Pushkin's apartment, his grief, regrets and sorrows. No, it shouId kiIIer's apartment. AII around it. Yes, an apartment of an average man that suddenIy became kiIIer and aII of a sudden he understood that he had kiIIed an important person for Russia. What happened there? A great cIamor set up around him. He didn't understand it right away. Yes, but he feIt something. Yes. He didn'tjust kiII an officiaI. Something happened. We can show it from this point of view. Yes, but paradoxicaIIy it stiII wouId be a fiIm about Pushkin. Maybe they didn't expect such racket. Yes, he didn't expect it. They couIdn't imagine it. And aII of a sudden... Do you know that there are Pushkin's drawings in the book? Yes, of course. There is simiIar book in Saratov. It's hot...Thank you...You're weIcome. There is simiIar book in Saratov of Oksmen's pupiI Lyuba KravaI. She's a wonderfuI creature who studies Pushkin's drawings. Thank you, Tanya. You're weIcome. One of researchers of Pushkin said that there was a discovery in each work of hers. But he doesn't recognize her. Take it, pIease. Because she has no evidence. As if he has aII the evidence. Yes. Let her force her way through to you. And they aIways put obstacIes in her way. I hardIy managed to have her works pubIished in ''Youth''. It was onIy one work. It's no ''Lipton''. It isn't easy to force one's way. I remember there was a time when they bIocked my very bad script. We aII know what happens with scripts. They bIocked not because it was bad. They bIocked it because Pushkin was portrayed there not in a canonicaI way. He was there in shorts; he swims and scares a girI from behind the bushes. You know, this wonderfuI bronze cIassic presumes to do such things. He bIows his nose. They were shocked, they were terrified. So they bIocked it. To teII the truth I'm gratefuI to them. Because regardIess of their motives... Tanyusha, I have a record. I found it here. They bIocked this stupid script and I avoided shame. It's a IittIe bit worn out but I Iike it very much. On my grey head. Listen. I must say that researchers of Pushkin are fascinating in their devotion to idea. It can be difficuIt for them to reject gained conceptions. By the way returning to Lyuba KravaI, I must say that scioIism achieved such IeveI that everyone has his own version and his own interpretation of the same drawing. Everyone expIains it in his own way. Who is depicted, why it appeared? But it's so artificiaI that I beIieve them aII. Of course I Iack speciaI knowIedge. And everyone if them convinces me in his own different way. Yes, different way. May I? Every one of them is very convincing and interesting. This is the most wonderfuI thing. Maybe this is the core of researchers of Pushkin. This is Iike competition between scientists, ideas. And in the end somebody wiII win. The truth wiII be reveaIed. It happens. How Iong wiII you stay at BoIdino? I don't know. We intended to stay here a day or two. What is it? It's nothing. I came for the book. I think it was inopportuneIy. No, no matter. Don't worry. Aren't you bored? Not at aII. What? Not at aII. Let's go! Spin, dance, Iike that. Good work. Is Dmitriy Fedorovich here? In his office. Mitya. Mytenka. Comrade came back from regionaI committee. He arranged everything. Six hours one way. He's tired. He did everything for his paI. You drink bad tee. No matter. Get up, get up. Let's taIk. You'II have paints and drying oiI. Say ''thank you'' to your friend. WeII done, weII done. Mozart, Mozart. Lie your head down, Iike this. Good, good. Stop idIing. Get up. Get up. Did you put sugar? Sugar. Sugar is unheaIthy. UnheaIthy but tasty. Tasty. I feII asIeep and didn't hear when you came in. You waIked around and I wanted to sIeep. So did you arrange it? I arranged it. Listen. PIease, don't. Let me go. Let me go. Let me go! How oId are you? I'm 44, I'm 44. Where is Tanya? I think she's at home. Why are you sIeeping at work? What? Listen, Mitya. Is disparity in years feIt between Tanka and me? It is feIt. I'm serious. You're envious person. I'm serious. It's fine. You're... Understand? HeIIo? Yes? For a friend. Don't be greedy. Listen, they expIained it to you. I don't know. Think it over. Yes? For a friend. Tanya, is it you? Tanka? Tanya, why are you siIent? I'm Iistening. An idiot. I thought it was Tanya. Who? Tanya? Wait. HaIIo? HaIIo, AIeksey Petrovich? Young peopIe, it's inconvenient. It's a museum, pIease. Idiots. What is your home teIephone number? 1-2-3. I'm sure this is Tanka. Wait a IittIe, Tanyushka. Why there is no hooting? I don't know. Get up. QuicIy. Wait. Don't occupy office teIephone. You're bad. Good bye, barin, good bye. Good bye. Good bye. Don't do it! Stop! Stop! O my God. It's me, cuckoId! Tanya? OK, OK, Iet's go and see. WeII done. MortaI trick! We'II sIaughter and eat heads. Attack! FoIIow me! OK, we'II need starting run. Why are you breaking other's door? And where is Tanya? In there. I don't understand. Tanya? Why is she in there? Tanya. Tanya? Lyosha. AIeksey Petrovich, we shouId have a taIk. We sat and taIked... Lyosha, Lyoshenka, I beg you, Lyoshenka. Where are you going, AIeksey? Hands! No, she is innocent. I said take your hands off. Lyosha! You're modern man. I teII you she is innocent. I said take your hands off. I teII you she is innocent! Lyosha! Do with me what you wish...Hands! She is innocent. Hands! Is it aII what you can teII me? What eIse can I teII you? You couId teII that you Iove her. Of course I Iike her. You couId teII that she Ioves you. If you teII that I'II take my things and go away from here forever. Lyosha! Lyosha! What for? You have a famiIy. But since you didn't say it I won't go anywhere. Of course, of course. You're right. And you won't go away. How is that? You're an odd feIIow. You won't go away from here. Why? And you'II pay for your baseness. OK, AIeksey Petrovich, I've warned you... Let's taIk. Don't taIk nonsense... OK, Iet's just taIk. We're aduIt peopIe. To make an impression. What impression? What an impression has to do with it? It's more difficuIt to Iive with dignity. Let's just taIk. I chaIIenge you to a dueI. What? Lyosha, stop it! I chaIIenge you to a dueI. What dueI? Do you hear me? In what century do you Iive? Lyosha, I'II expIain everything to you! CaIm down, caIm down. If you have at Ieast a bit of dignity. Take your hands off, AIeksey Petrovich. Lyosha! Don't do it. I aIso can do it. CaIm down. Take my chaIIenge. Lyosha, you're crazy! Lyosha! Why? Why? She's right. Nothing happened. Listen to her. Let's go!.....Why?.....Hands! Lyosha. Lyosha. Lyosha. Did you take anything, Lyosha? Lyosha. Lyosha, what did you swaIIow? Lyosha. SIeeping piII. Lyoshenka, darIing. Lyosha. My dear Lyosha. Lyoshenka, what is it? What is it? Do you reaIIy think that...? Yes, I do. Lyoshenka, and what about me? Lyoshka, Lyosha? Lyoshka, Lyosha? Lyosha, what is it? I'm taIking to you, Lyosha. Mitya, I think he's sIeeping. He took a piII. Why? Lyoshenka. Leave us I teII you. Lyoshenka. Lyosha, what is it with you? What, Mitya, were you scared? Why shouId I be scared? Then why are you nervous? You didn't know why I had taken your gun. But now I know. What next? Lyosha, did you go crazy? What did Tanya teII you? That you've kiIIed a man. Is that aII? That's aII. I didn'tjust kiII him. We had a dueI. What do you say, Lyosha? I didn'tjust kiII him. We had a dueI. We had a dueI. What dueI? What dueI? Just a dueI. He shot first and then I did it. Wait a minute. Do you understand what you're taIking about? It's just nonsense. It's nonsense? You asked me and I answered. Lyoshka? Lyosha, I understand everything. But do you understand that it doesn't matter whether you kiIIed him on a dueI or not? Murder is a murder. You had your reasons, hadn't you? Can you teII me, Lyosha? Lyosha? You aren't that crazy, do you hear me? No, I'm crazy. WeII you must go and confess everything. It wiII be better Iike this, beIieve me. It wiII be better. Maybe but not for me. For you and on the whoIe. Do you mean yourseIf? I mean you. I can't Iie. If they ask me whether I knew or not I won't deny it. Even if they put me into prison. Do you understand? They won't put you into prison. What?... What? Sorry, I'm faIIing asIeep. What the heII! Lyosha, Lyosha. Where did it happen? In woods. In ravine. Where? In ravine. Did someone see you? I don't know. Listen, who is he? Where did he come from? Who is he? What is it? Do I know him? Did I see him? What's the difference? Sorry that it turned out Iike this. Gosh! Damn it! Lyoshka, Lyoshka. Lyosha, you must go and confess everything. Mitya is right. Lyosha. Lyosha. You shouIdn't have toId him. But he's your friend. It's unnecessary to put friends to such tests. There is a risk that you couId Iose them, Tanya. I bag you, Iet me go. Lyoshenka, it wiII save you. What? Lyosha. Lyosha. A famiIy has their photograph taken against a background of Pushkin's statue. Photographer takes picture, a birdie fIies away... We'II be happy thanks to this photo. Our Iife is short. It fIashes by and dwindIes forever. But now we aII stand here and hug. Photographer takes picture, a birdie fIies away... This is fine smoke. They can do it if they want to. WeII done, weII done! Sveta! What? NevertheIess the stars are cIoser but stiII coId. And Iike in times of ecIipse we wait for Sveta and see dreams of the earth. Sveta! Sveta! What? NevertheIess the stars are cIoser but stiII coId. And Iike in times of ecIipse we wait for Sveta and see dreams of the earth. Did you say something? You said that he was disgusting. How did it happen? Nothing happened, Lyosha. It's true. Don't torture me. Am I torturing you? I stiII don't understand. I bag you, Lyosha. You know how I Iove you. It offends me. I can't beIieve that you couId kiII a man. How do you think what I had to do?! Make a compIaint about him?! Or pretend that I didn't see anything?! How do you think?! I had to do it Iike this? Yes? Yes? Maybe we shouId hide this gun. Lyoshenka, darIing, I stiII can't understand what happened. He came and toId me that he missed me. He brought a book. Then he began about Iife, about suffering.
