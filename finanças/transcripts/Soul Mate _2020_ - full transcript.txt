DEDICATED TO THE SOUL OF RAGAA AL GEDDAWY - Will you stop screaming? - I'm ululating, not screaming. - Are you so happy? - Yes, this is my daughter's wedding. Wrong. You should act like mothers who will miss their daughters. You should cry and say that your daughter will leave you. Make fake impressions. Like this wedding. Dad, I will drive the bride's car. How cute you are! Take a look at the man you created. You'll take your sister to her husband? - You said that he's her husband. - I didn't approve yet. - Didn't approve what? - This is her wedding. Weddings are meant to be canceled. The camera's still far away. I hope it goes better the next time. - Omar! - What? Take this. - What is this? - Just take it. - Really? - Don't make a scene. I don't care. - Take it. I don't need it. - Omar! - What is that? - This is a diarrhea pill for him, he just ate some bad food… - Seriously, Omar, what is that? - Hi, dear, won't you tell me to take care of her and all that? How come? To me, you're like a son. That's why I approved the marriage. Samir did too. He agreed since he knows you adore her. - Right, Fatma? - Sure, we'll take care of her. My sweetheart! Shall we go? I can't wait. - I can't wait either. - Really? I can't wait to take off my shoes and put on sneakers to dance freely. Shoes? I can't wait to take off all my clothes and… People can hear you. Everyone knows what will happen after the wedding. Don't you see your dad? He can't bear looking at me, he knows… - Dad? - No, wait! Omar wants you, dad. Move aside. I want to come closer. Wait, we will only take one picture. - I'm the groom! - Please. - It's okay, honey. - Let's go home, Reem. - Omar! - What? Unbelievable. Your snoring is louder than the waves. It's a beautiful and peaceful day. It makes you want to sleep. I'm bored. Can we do anything? I want to walk, swim, or do any activity. I can't do anything. Didn't you get tired after last night? Such a strong man! Strong? my back is killing me after what happened yesterday. I feel like I'm with my dad. I'll relax, and you can enjoy and do anything you want. No, I want you to do any activity with me, please. I've a good idea for you. You can go dig a hole on the beach, then wake me up when you're done. You are silly, Omar. I don't need you, I will manage alone. - I will… - Enjoy. - No, Omar. Please. - I swear I can't. Please. Come with me, please. Sweetheart, I can't resist your beautiful eyes. Well, go change your clothes, then wake me up. - Okay. - Hurry. - Did you sleep again, Omar? - No, I didn't I'm awake. - What are you wearing? - I know you well. You'd say you're jealous and shit if I wore a bikini. Shit? You're such a romantic. - I wanna do snorkeling. - Snorkeling? Are you kidding? Water's too cold, and your father worries so much about you. If you catch a cold, he won't spare me. You promised me, Omar. Please. I can't resist you talking like this. - Let's go. - Come on. Listen, let's do snorkeling here. No, I want to go deeper. No. Here is enough. Come on. Hey! I don't like these pranks, Reem. I told you I don't like it. - Such a coward. - Coward? - Alright. - Come on. Reem. I told you I don't like these pranks, Reem. Get out of the water. Reem. Reem. Reem. Help! - What happened? - Help! What happened? Tell us, what happened? My wife. Somebody help us! Why are you doing this to yourself, son? What is with the drinking? Shame on you. Why? Since when do you do that? Don't move anything, please. There're many things to move. You're disobeying God, son. Please, Mom, enough of this. - Let him alone. - Let him? I'm already letting him. Are we going against God's will? Would it make you happy if I left? How would this make us happy? It's okay, Omar. You've locked yourself for a long time. I know. What would you like me to do? Easy, Omar. We want you to be happy. Omar, you should go to a doctor. Why should I go? I'm fine. Come on. Come with me. Let's eat something. My head's killing me, I have a headache. Enough, I beg you. You're killing me this way. God! You're literally killing her. She'll die of sorrow. Omar, come on. Come on, dear. Make up with her. My head! Careful, son. It's alright. Mom, I'm sorry. I will see the doctor. - What is that stench? - What? Go wash your mouth out. Not again! Not again? Okay, mom. Mr. Omar, you can go ahead. How long will this take? Why are you sitting like this? You see me nuts? Are you afraid of me escaping? I'm good. - You can leave. - Okay. - Okay, Omar. - Alright. The appointment was set up by a young lady named Heba. - She is your sister, right? - Right. This means you're here against your will? That's true. I won't be able to help you, then. You can sit if you want, but if you don't, so… Usually, the first question is, why you decided to come here? But I'll ask you another question. Looking at your situation, why do you refuse any help? What can help me? I can't believe. Going to someone I don't know and tell him about my life, - then I will only take meds. - I don't write prescriptions. You are not sick. All you need is someone to help you. And what do I gain from talking? Will I get my wife back? The dead don't come back. If you asked for help, nobody will return your wife to you. But you are here so you are the one who will return. But she, she isn't coming back. Can you tell me about the turning point in your life? She was between my arms, I lost her all of a sudden. I feel like I've been betrayed. I didn't get to say goodbye. If you'd said goodbye, would you have relieved? Do you know what it means… being with the man protecting you, and he fails؟ Do you know what she felt? Maybe nothing. Why are you so sure that she felt something in that moment? Because I'm not sure, I'm not well. And when others say she's in a better place and everything, that doesn't help at all. Because if she's in a better place, I want to be with her. - Do you think of suicide? - Very much. But, I'm afraid that if I've committed suicide, I won't see her. You don't know how kind she was. If you committed suicide, and she is that kind, you will never be with her. The images we create for things are inside of us. Even your imagination about her current place. It also exists right here. The thing is she's not only here. - I'll let you see her. - What? I'll let you speak with her. - How? - We'll work on your feelings of pain that are holding you down. I'm totally fine with the idea of seeing her. - But, will you make me forget her? - No. I don't have this ability. This your life, your experience. I can't interfere. I'm only a guide. Let's return to the possibility of seeing her. - How can I see her? - By exercise. Relaxation sessions. I'll let you communicate with her from inside. What exactly should I do? Just close your eyes. Like that. Every breath you take will take you even if you are stressed to an extremely relaxed state. I want you to imagine stairs, which is created by your imagination. We'll call it a relaxation stair. Each step you take will take you to a deeper feeling. I will be there to help you. And if something annoyed you in that state, You will have control on it, because it's all in your head. You will see gates. Only you know how many there are. Choose one. And walk through it. Where have you gone? Nowhere, I am right here. Listen, I'll leave with that guy for a moment and come back quickly. Where are you going? I'll bring something really quick. For weeds, right? What the fuck are you doing? Right now? You know everything now? It's so beautiful out here and we'll have a beautiful night, and of course, weeds are great here. I will be quick. Okay? I won't be late. Damn it! There's no signal at all. I'm sorry. - Are you filming me? - Of course not. - Don't look. - I'm not filming. I didn't mean it. I came here for signal. Sorry. I came to take a piss since I didn't think anyone would leave the camp. I've clearly entered a women's restroom. - I'm really sorry… - No, It's okay. - I didn't mean to… - No problem. You can take your turn, I won't look. - Sorry? - No, I mean… Saif. Hi. Oh, one sec. Saif. Hi, Saif. I'm Laila. You are right! I'm really sorry, I came up here looking for cell signal. - Isn't there any signal… - No, do not even try. Which is the best thing here, to unplug from everything - Wouldn't that be boring? - It seems that you're not a fan of safari. No, to be honest. This is my first time. It seems you are an expert in that. Yes, I am. I've been here since 9:00 am. First time also. - Like me? - I bought a four by four car, so I thought of coming to desert. - Have we met before? - No, I just saw you down there dancing with that little girl. Dancing? I was just messing around. No, it seemed like you know how to move. Especially when she was standing on your feet. My dad was doing this. I'm not a good dancer. I just move around. - Just move? - Yes, just let go and follow music. And just move your body, you need to let yourself go. Just try it. - Try what? - Try to let yourself go. Just move with the music. Are you still standing? Try it. Follow the music. - Like that? - Yes, Try to turn. Easy. Give me your hand. Hey, baby. I looked all over for you. I came up here looking for cell signal. Saif, this is Ahmed, my fiancé. - Your fiancé? - Yes. Hi, nice to meet you. She was lost, and all places look the same here. Take care of her. Excuse me. - Why did you go there? - As I told you. I've been looking for cell signal. Have you finished the shit you were doing? Again? Look at our destiny and its messages It knew what's in your heart And brought it to you And you can see and touch it You try to reach out But you can't take it Look at destiny and what it's doing It can't do favors Look at our destiny and its messages It knew what's in your heart Look at destiny and what it's doing It can't do favors Saif, aren't you going to sleep? I will sleep, honey. You sleep first. - Let's count. - Okay. One, two, three, four… Where are you going? - I will return quickly. - Going to the toilet? Go to sleep, brat. Laila, where are you going? I'm not feeling well, so I will go and get some fresh air. - Okay, but don't get too far. - Okay. Shouldn't you introduce yourself well? Why are you still up? And what do you mean? You should say, "Saif, a married man, and I've a boy and a girl." Why don't men properly introduce themselves? Why don't women properly introduce themselves? What do you mean? You should've said, "Laila, and engaged." Not Laila only. And there's a study that say a married man doesn't say he's married unless he doesn't like the girl he's with. What is that study? A world-famous study. Maybe that's why people wear rings. By the way, I didn't get a chance to say that I'm engaged. I don't like wearing rings. Also, I don't care about your engagement. That's right. You don't have to know anything about me. - I really don't need to know anything. - And I won't tell you. Do you love him? It is a little colder tonight, right? Yes. There's something missing here, like… - Don't say weeds. - Weeds? What are you saying? No, of course not. Why are you still awake? - I didn't even sleep. - Why? - Children are crying or what? - I wouldn't leave them if they're crying. Why didn't you sleep until now? Thinking of Ali? - It's not his name. - I don't care. - He is Ahmed. - There's no difference. And no, I'm not thinking of him. - Are you thinking of me? - Are you kidding? We both are kidding. - I wish I'd met you sooner. - You are really kidding. What we're doing is wrong. What we're saying is wrong. Even sitting here with you is wrong… Sometimes what is wrong feels right, but it comes at the wrong time. Is it another study? No, I'm just joking. The sun is about to rise. I need to sleep. - Ten seconds and it will rise. - Ten seconds? Wanna count? - Oh, really? - Yes. One, two, - three. - Three. - Four. - Four. Five. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten. What happened? How long has it been? According to duration of session, it is 70 minutes. Drink some water. I've seen her. I've seen her like I see you now. Only I didn't know her. Even me, I was someone else. I was married and… - What was that? - We call that the alternate universe. You can interact with it, but only through your subconscious. More importantly, tell me how you are now. I don't know. I feel confused. I saw her, but she wasn't Reem. My feelings for her were also different. She looked exactly like her, but her name was Laila. Did you feel better after seeing her? Sort of. But I didn't get enough. When is the next session? It's the secretary who sets the dates. That's her job. What should I do now? Are you asking me?! What you want to do is entirely up to you. - When's the next date? - One second, let me check. - I will bring the car while you do that. - Okay. You really want to come again? Same time next week. - Is there no sooner date? - That is the only date available. I'll call you if anything changes. Please call if you found a sooner date. Thank you. Will you tell me? - Tell me what she did with you. - I can't tell you. But she made me see Reem. What the hell? Seriously, I don't want to talk about it. It's okay, dear. - What do you feel now? - I feel confused and sleepy. - You can sleep until we arrive. - Okay. - Welcome back, dear. - Thank you. - Tell me, what happened? - All is well. Thanks God. You can have lunch and tell me what happened. I'm not hungry, mom. I'm gonna sleep. You can sleep in my house. I'll do better here. By the way, I was preparing everything to sleep here with you. Please, mom! I need to be alone. I'm sorry, mom. I'm not feeling well. I need to be alone. When I feel good, I will come to you, or call you to come stay with me. I'm sorry. Omar. Welcome back. Thank you. - Are you okay, Omar? - Yes, I'm good. We're having dinner outside tonight. Would you like to come? Thanks. But I can't. Why are you so confused? Tell me. What did you do last week? Nothing. Just got to work. Good. Why did you go? They've waited me for so long. And it's not their fault that I can't live well. And you've come to see her. Yes, of course. - Won't you make me sleep and see her? - I've told you before, All of that is inside your head. Which one you'd like to see? Reem? Or Laila? I wasn't myself with Laila. But I was happy to see Reem. I'm confused, to be honest. - And did you like Laila? - Yes. But she wasn't Reem, and I wasn't Omar. Also, we weren't together. There's something kept us away. Do you have an explanation for this? I can't understand. You are now ready for the session. Just close your eyes, take a deep breath, and slowly exhale. Focus on my voice. Grab the oil. Yeah. That's it. - Show me. - Here, take a look. What do you think? What is that? Where is my face? Are you kidding? You know I'm shooting your hands only. You only like my hand and fingers? You are well aware that I only need hand model. In all of these ice cream and cheese commercials, you will not shoot my face for once? - Am I ugly? - I swear you are adorable. I've told you before, I don't like portraits or shooting people. Why is it so complicated? Why not shooting people? Photo shooting bring people together, this camera captures your soul, and get the photographer closer to you. I don't want to get close to anyone. - That's a different story. - What story? Because it's not up to you to keep people away, but you can keep yourself away. - It's okay. Be a one-sided photographer. - That's not possible. It's not up to you not to love. Anyway, love, getting attached, and breakup don't need cameras. There are people, once you look into their eyes, you find yourself attached to them. Stop complaining. You just don't want to be famous. If I took a photo of you, I will be famous? Just try it. - Go stand there. - Really? Go before I change my mind. Okay, let's do it. Well. Come closer. That's it. What's wrong? Don't make these silly things. Okay. What do you need me to do? - Just be yourself. - Okay. Just be yourself and smile, you don't have to be sad. Just smile. Yeah. Nice. - That's it. - Show me. Look. How pretty I am. I'm so hot. I knew you were good at shooting people, - not an idiot as I say. - Idiot? - I'll delete these photos, then. - I'm not talking about you. The charm is but in front of camera. Really? That's why you make cheese commercials. - I will tease Carmen with this photo. - Oh, really? How ridiculous you and your friend are. Yes, she's my friend, and I am also her manager. Okay, manager. I'm starving; how about dinner? - Sushi. - Sushi is cat food. I will buy you a great meal. - Shall we go? - Okay. I will never work again with that stylist. Have you seen what she sent? She doesn't know anything about the character and we'll be fucked. I also think she's a bad stylist. I don't know why the director wants her? Don't worry about it. What's the story of the beautiful pictures you posted yesterday? - Did you like it? - Very much. - Who took them? - A great photographer. Where have you been hiding him? - He says he doesn't like shooting people. - And what are you? No, I am different. Okay, Mrs. different. He's arrogant. You won't be able to handle him. - Arrogant? - Yes. You must bring him today. Don't worry, I will take care of it. - You mean today? - Yes, call him. - Right now? - Yes! Okay. Tell him to come for the post-conference photo shoot. Okay. I'll call him. - I'll go get ready. - Okay. - What's up? - This is first time you pick up quickly. Is it my fault that I did? Listen. The photos made a fuss. - What fuss? - Didn't you check Instagram? - Carmen wants you today. - Who is Carmen? I just woke up. Listen, you have to come to the location I will send to you. You can't apologize. She would think I'm jealous of her. No, no. Tell her that I didn't answer. Why? I spoke highly of you. I told her your pay is high. You know, it's not about money. You have to come. I don't need any drama with her. - Ask anything you want? Just two photos. - Anything I want? You silly cute boy, I mean you can ask the highest rate for these photos. - How are you? - Hello. This is Yassen. He's so creative. You'll shine like a diamond. - Not so much. - Alia's so excited for you. - You came alone? - Sorry? I mean, no assistant or someone to adjust lighting? To show off? No, I'm good. That's the organizer. I need to meet her. Need anything? As I've said. Let them make everything like I said. Okay. Ready? I want you to be yourself. Don't act like you know there's a camera. I just know what pose is better for the photo. - But, I have another opinion. - And I want the photo like that. You want the photo like that? I think you have to find someone else, because I don't do what other people think. - Excuse me. - What's this? Where are you going? Are you leaving? Yes, I'll leave. I don't think I can help you like you want. We can work something out, you shouldn't leave like that. Believe me, I don't like shooting people. I can recommend someone to continue working with you because I understand you are in a rush. Do not worry. He'll do everything you say. I can't believe you're doing that. Wait, what do you mean by "Don't act."? I mean be yourself. But, I know this is your problem. - Who are you referring to? - You the actors. It's hard to be yourself because you are taking too many rules. You always act. I'm not acting right now. - What? Aren't you acting? - No. I am not. - This is you being yourself? - Of course, yes. You must be kidding. This is a big problem. - I don't understand. - It's a problem if this is your nature. Why is this a problem? - No, wait. I'm not ready… - Stay still. Don't be nervous at all. - I can't believe you. - You know your eyes are beautiful? Also, your smile. This one is great. And this one. - This is awesome. - No, I like this more. Actually, photos aren't that good, you are the beautiful one, to be honest. Should I take this as flirting? Yes, it is. Okay, I will take it as flirting. - Have you finished? - Yes. - I want to see. - The photos are great. - This is the best photo shoot in my life. - Thank you. - You should get ready quickly. - Yes. Can you take my photos tomorrow after the conference? Yes, sure. You coming tomorrow? Yeah, there's no problem. You, Yassen, are coming tomorrow, and stand among photographers, - and shoot Carmen? - Why are you cutting? Yes, I am coming tomorrow to stand among photographers. Did Yassen come? - Yassen? What do you want from him? - To take my photos. There are other photographers here. - Did he come or not? - No, he didn't. - Why? - I don't know. Who would know then, Alia? Go ahead. You've previously stated that this film is unique and different. What makes this one unique and different than others you've made? This movie addresses women's issues in a way we have not seen before. I won't make any spoilers, you've to watch it yourself. Does that mean your work in movies serves your work as Goodwill Ambassador for women in Africa? I try as much as I can to choose roles that send important messages to women, especially movies that show woman as a strong person. Is it related to your personal life? Is it related to your personal life? You mean that I have a strong character or a week one? I can't understand your question. Another question. Can I ask a personal question? - No, personal questions, please. - It's okay. What was the reason for divorce? There are some decisions you make in your life, and you have to pay for it for long time. I've decided that I've paid enough for it. - Another question, please. - Go ahead. Who would you give up everything for and… and what? And just to talk to him and drink coffee with him? Someone when I be with him, I fell that I don't need anyone else. And not aware of time and space or anything else. That's it, guys. Thanks for your questions. If there's anything, contact our official page, Carmen answers herself. What are you doing? I should ask you that? Why do you look to him like that? You just saw him yesterday. Do you know what you are doing? I'm a human being who can like someone. You are a divorced actress! - Your divorce was all over the press. - I don't care. - That's not how we work. - Alia, work only, - not my life, okay? - Your work is your life. And also my work. Let alone we are friends, aren't we? - What you're doing is not in good for you. - I don't give a shit. I've had enough. Alia, let's not lose each other because of your control. Yassen. - You know what you have done? - What? - You know well. - No, I don't. - Why are you talking like that? - Do you know who she is? You know that her ex-husband can crush you just because you got close to her? Please, go. Wasn't it I who told you to come? I'm now telling you to leave. If it was anyone else talking to me like that, I would've dealt with him. Thank you for doing that me. I'm not answering that nonsense. Yassen. You insist on causing problems, right? Were you going to drink coffee with me, or did you change your mind? Sit properly. Wear this so people won't recognize you. - Wanna drive? - No. - First time? - I do everything for first time. It's the first time I meet myself in a long time I feel and live with you a feeling I've only heard of it The masks have now been removed And I've seen what I didn't before A strange world where I'm happy I was afraid of it A weird person, yet beautiful Made me see the world through his eyes There're a lot of beautiful things hiding from the eyes There're a lot of beautiful things hiding behind insanity Why me? And why me? For the same reasons you have. And how did you know my reasons? Who is your ex-husband that terrifies people? What's between you and Alia? Nothing. There's nothing. Look me in the eye as you respond. Do you love her? I've never felt the way I do with you. You are admitting two things here. You know… I used to say that anyone who marries an actress is a moron. Why are you rude? - I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. - Is what you said normal? - Isn't the actor human? - I said "actress" not "actor." Do you frequently nitpick in the midst of fighting? Are we fighting? Go on. I mean the actress is just an actress, she may pretend to love me, so how can I love her? She can fake her feelings toward me. - Idiot. - Me? You are all like that, you don't know anything. Who do you mean? This is what I think. Many girls, by the way, can fake their feelings without having to act. Who wants to fake feelings doesn't need to be a famous actor. How can I be so sure? Look her in the eye, and you will know. I'm sorry. For what? For not meeting you sooner. Why does this happen? - What's up? - I've seen Reem. - No, she was Carmen. - You mean - you didn't see Laila? - I've seen a different woman. I was in another universe, as if I were dreaming. Of course, I was dreaming. How do you feel about Laila, Carmen, and Reem? My head is killing me. I don't understand. Why do I keep seeing her as another woman with a different name? Me too. I feel like I'm getting lost. I'm hesitant and feel confused. It's okay. You have a long journey. He exaggerates, you know. He's not the first one to lose a wife. He has feelings, not like you. What would you have done if you had lost your wife? It would be my lucky day. I'm hoping for this day. - I hope she dies. - I swear, I will tell her that, so she knows that her husband is an animal. His wife is far worse than he is. Remember last week? - Stop. - I swear, I'll tell her. She hit him in the head, his head was so swollen. You deserve that. Instead of making fun of Omar, let's think how we can help him. - I feel sad for him. - You are right. - This company is… - Omar's here. Why didn't you reply on the e-mail I sent? I didn't receive any. You'd know I sent an e-mail 15 minutes ago, if you weren't joking. - Hi, Omar? When did you come? - I was on time. What do you think about going out after work or in the evening? - Let's make it, Omar. Please. - Please. - Check your email. - I can't stand this company to… He doesn't even bother to look at anyone. And you text me the location of where you'll be tonight. Really, Omar? That doesn't mean you don't have to check your e-mail. Isn't there anything important than that e-mail, Omar? We wanna eat. You're all on your phones? We could've made a video call from home. What should we do? They didn't serve the food yet. Maybe her phone's dead. You know her. Why don't you come sit here? I'm good here. - Hi, guys. - Hi, Hend. - Hi. - Guys, this is my yoga friend, Hend. Move your leg please. I can't reach you on your phone. Is it dead or what? - Told you. - It's not dead. I decided not to focus on Facebook or WhatsApp since we are out. - Omar, I wanted to introduce… - I will introduce myself. - Hi. - Hi. I'm Hend, the divorced. - Hi. - You are, Omar, the widower. Widower, right? - Yes. - Did I offend you by saying that? - I just don't like that word. - I also don't like "the divorced". - Why do you say it then? - This my new title, I've to adapt. Why you should adapt? May you find someone good to marry. No, I'm good like that, plus, I've lost some weight. All divorced women say that, and they eventually marry. Maybe. Only if we found someone good to us… Listen. - Do you know why I'm here? - Why? It's like a blind date. - I've noticed that. - It's so obvious. Your friends love you so much. But none of them realize what we're going through. - Why did you come, then? - To have dinner. - Really? - Yes. Do you know what is strange? People think that you need anyone to enter your life. Yes. They all think like that. How can you sit with them? This is not cool. Listen, I want to leave, do you have a car? - Yes, but… - But what? This is so boring, unbelievable. It seems you've become friends so fast. Yes, we were just speaking about you. He was saying that this is so boring and not cool at all. She's too honest. I'm sorry, Omar. No. She's so cool. - Will you drive me? Come on. - Yes, of course. Goodbye. The plan failed? - Yes, I think so. - How? They've left together, and left all the food to us, which is an amazing thing. - Thanks for the ride. - You are welcome. - Did I upset you? - On the contrary, you are too honest, which is a good thing for me. Sara thought that meeting someone will make you feel better. Many people think they understand everything, but they don't. You know, we've something in common. I don't mean to be tacky and cliché. I mean both of us are complicated. - How? - You didn't get to live with your wife, and I didn't get any chance in my marriage. He divorced me after one year only. That idiot didn't give my any chance. - Like his mother, he is always in a rush. - It's a good thing it's been only a year. - You would have suffered. - Thanks God. We can't be together, by the way. And we can't be with anyone. We both are complicated. I can't do anything at all. That wraps it up for this evening. How was your week? It was all at work, and I tried to go out, but I felt uncomfortable. Why? My coworkers tried to set me up with someone so that we could be together. - And you don't want that? - I can't. At all. Let alone my family. - What about it? - Always saying things like, "How was your session? What progress have you made?" "Do you think there has been progress?" That's okay. They need to know what progress you've made so they don't have to worry. Lister, Omar. You are here, so that you don't have to worry. Never do something you don't want to do only to please others. You understand? Tell me. What's the most you want right now? I'd like to see her and tell her what I couldn't say, and what I wasn't saying. But I want Reem, no one else. Do not set any conditions. Do not constrain your mind. Because all you see in sessions - is created by your imagination. - Why do we leave each other every time? - You have the answer for that. - But I need you to answer me. I don't have answers. Don't think that I will tell you something to cheer you up or because you want to hear it. You hiding something from me? I've already told you that she's gone and will never back. - Let's start our session. - Let's start. I need you to relax, okay? Let yourself go. Do not fight any idea. Focus on… your breath. Take it, Mohammed. - Saad, come here. - Yes, Mr. Zain. - Easy. - Okay. Tell me, what's the matter with the horse? - He didn't eat since yesterday. - He was okay while I was here yesterday. He's only fine when you are around, However, once you go, he refuses to eat or drink. Call Dr. Sameh, and I will come by evening. - Yes, sir. - Alright. Why are you late, Zain? I'm not coming at all. No, do not do that to me. Do not let me in this party alone. You know I don't like this boring party, dad. Is it what real men do? Leaving your old man alone? Why don't you leave the party and come with me? I can't. You know you mom. She doesn't let me. Come for a bit, then we can leave. Come on, dad. You always do that to me. Okay. - Son of a bitch. - Son of a bitch? Who do you say that to, son of a bitch? Of course not you. Hang up now, I'm coming. You sound like you won't come. And you followed me here? - How rude you are. - Welcome, Mr. Zain. - Hello. Hi. - Hello. Hello. Hi, Mona. How are you? How is your husband? - He's in prison. - Send him my love. - What about leaving this boring party? - Listen well. Stop being rude and give me a break. If your mom got angry, no one will help you. Help me, and I'll help you. What do you mean? I won't tell her about what happens in North Coast's villa. Hi. Your mom is here. Here he is. Zain, my dear. Hi, dear. This is uncle Alam, - owner of the glass factories. - Hello, sir. - Mrs. Nevin. His wife. - Hi. Hi. Zain, your mother taught me how to meditate. - She changed my whole life. - Really? - Really? She taught her how to meditate? - Yes. - We have to celebrate, then. - Sure. I will bring coffee, then. Wait. I will come with you, I will make my special coffee. And take you away from this lovely gathering? I will bring the special coffee. - Son of a bitch. - Enjoy. Hello, my love. - Your coffee, Mr. Zain. - Thank you. Will you curse at me again? I'm here to drink my coffee. Should I leave? Thought you were stalking me. - Why did you think that? - Why did you want to past me? I wanted to see that guy who can't drive. - You were already on the phone. - See? Did you see who's looking at the other one? I thought you were a guy. And why are you following guys? Or did you think I'm a guy here as well? No, listen carefully. This isn't nice. I was going to drink a cup of coffee away from the noise. - Do you love coffee? - Yes, I drink it. Here you go. - This is without sugar. - Did you believe I didn't bring it to you? - Take it, then. I don't need. - It's disgusting to drink it after you. - Where's Mai? - I don't know. She must be with her friends somewhere. - I want her to meet Zain. - Okay. Is your father the one who owns the glass factories? Is your mom the one who taught my mom to stand on one leg like swan? It's called yoga or meditation. That's nonsense. She was going to trip and fall twice. Of course your mom can't do it properly. Your mom brought you here to find a girl for you? Of course. Why are you here? This party sucks. I didn't want to come. Same. I didn't want to come. Lucky for me to find you here. - You can leave if you want. - And I want to stay. I'm happy like hits. Oh, this looks like a plan. Standing next to you gives them the impression that their plan worked. You see that handshake? That's not normal. - That firm handshake means a wedding. - Oh, damn. Congratulations. Can you please give me the box in the glove compartment? Here? - What's this? - Thank you. - Thank you. - Why? I told you to give it to me. Why would I give it to you? This is for someone else. We shouldn't try to take everything. Unbelievable. Yes. Yes, Mail. Thanks God. I won't be able to meet you today. The horse is sick. Okay, I will call you later. Bye. What is this? Where Dr. Sameh? Who are you? And why did you enter here? Who am I?! Who is she? Dr. Sameh out of town, she is the doctor he sent. - You know what you're doing? - Please, go out. I can't work like this. You embarrassed him. Stand properly. What's up? I gave him the shot, I will not leave until he's okay. I will wait too. - As you like. - Excuse me, I wanted to apologize for yelling at you. You don't know how I love that horse. I get it. It's okay. Okay. It's so cold. What about having a drink? - Saad. - Yes, Mr. Zain. They're making tea so bad here, so drink something else. - What should I do for you doctor? - Coffee please. - As you wish. - Use my special coffee. - I'm Zain. - Farah. Since I will stay here, I need to make a call. Yes, go ahead. Where is Dr. Sameh? He always comes. - He's in a conference. - How I'm lucky. Are you being sarcastic? Of course not. I already apologized. Forgive me. I was just nervous. And when you love someone, you can't imagine him sick or dead. - We all die in the end. - But it hurts the living. It's the parting that hurts. Even more than death. The possibility of missing emotions. It seems you're still mad at me. No, not mad at all. Maybe I'm mad because of other things. Okay. You can think of me as a friend, and tell me what other things. Maybe it's nothing. I don't want to tell you after what you just said. Is it because I told you to think of me as a friend? But, because you're all like that, believing that women make such a drama, and in fact, it is "nothing". And now, even before I say anything else, you've said it could be nothing and I'm causing a drama. Why did you make it about men and women? It looks you're making a big deal out of it. I'm not making… Don't think about the past or the future. Just think about today. - Okay Mr. Philosopher. - I'm not trying to be a philosopher, you can think of me as simple or naive, but it's better that way. But you're not naive. - Where did you get that confidence? - It's not confidence. Your body language exposes you. I shouldn't move while speaking then. What are you trying to hide by doing that? Listen, to prove to you that it's not about men and women. I was like you, focusing on each and every detail. Like all humans. Then what? I've been through a couple of heartbreaks. Then I recovered, and I began to pick what suits me rather than what I desire. It's not that easy. And you're not who you say you are. How did you know? It doesn't matter. Stay in your comfort zone. Aren't you happy like that? Continue doing so. - Saad. Come here. - Yes, sir. Why are you laughing? Do you know what comfort zone means? - I'm just embarrassed to say it. - It's okay. Just tell me. In my village, when a woman is preparing to marry, she should have it. All women should have la combinaison. - Really? - Yes. He is so creative. The "comfort zone" is the area in which you feel comfortable. Where you go, - and feel relaxed… - You mean the toilet? The comfort room, I understand. - I understand. - Go and check the IV. - I will run and check. - Come on. That's the least I've got. The third IV is done. Should I put the fourth? - Yes, please hurry. - Alright. Were you wearing a ring? - Yes. - Why did you take it off? Did it hurt your finger? Do you remember when you said that you've been through a couple of heartbreaks and then recovered? Yes. After you go through that, - you start to think rationally. - Yes. Then you think about the whole package, and trick himself with it. When you find someone good, kind and from a good family, - and there's a future of you together… - I get it. But after you try, life surprises you and you meet the reality. Even though you've got everything you wished for… You start to search for what your heart wants. Exactly. Sometimes, it's too late. And there's someone else who may pay for your mistakes. I believe that any mistake can be undone. This is what they say in movies. - Why? - Because I've tried, and it didn't work. Isn't there a package includes both the heart and the mind? The mind is not a part of the true love. Maybe it is the last person you imagine to love, and suddenly you find yourself so attached to him. And sometimes comes in the wrong time. Sometimes. What a strange world. Nothing comes in the right time. My advice for you, if the ring you wear is part of a package, think carefully. He's so happy. Look. - I don't know what to say to you. - Nothing. This is my job. I will go home to sleep, but I will return in the evening. You also should sleep. I think I can't leave him now. How come? We were up all the night, you seem exhausted. Okay. See you later. Bye. Wait. I will drive you. No, thanks. I can go alone. But you didn't sleep at all and must be tired. I can't leave you like that. I've to drive you. Thanks. But I got it. You must not have slept either. I will drive the doctor. I really do not need anyone to drive me. Don't you need anyone to drive you? You look tired. Thank you, Mai. I'm so exhausted. I don't know how I was going to drive. Since when does the doctor treat the horse? Since yesterday only. She must be skilled, then. So skilled. I didn't imagine that the horse will get back on his feet. I feel that you two know each other for very long. No. I just met her yesterday. Just met her yesterday and holding her hand to drive her? - It's okay… - No. No. It's not okay at all. Can we continue this tomorrow? I feel so tired and want to sleep. - We won't speak tomorrow or anytime. - All that because I wanted to drive her? Do you think I'm that naive? Of course not. Look me in the eye, and tell me that you don't have feelings for her. Don't lie, please. I won't lie to you, Mai. In fact, I don't know what happened. Nothing happened. - Mai, I don't know what to say. - Do not say anything. Go to her. Come on. Go. I don't want you to be sad. You can't be with someone just because he doesn't be sad. I'm sorry. Did you sleep well? Not so well. I'm happy that you came. You can't worry about Cesar anymore. Thanks to you. Be careful. I feel like you want to tell me something. How do you know what I want? Because I… I broke up with Mai yesterday. - Is it because what I said about…? - No. Not at all. It's not because what you said. I've thought carefully, and figured out that the package isn't good. I wanted to spend the rest of my life with someone else. - Someone else? - Our talk yesterday… Come on, mom. Dad is waiting outside. Until the world got us together Come on, honey. Someone else was standing on my door You've said things that opened my eyes Made me to reconsider I've found myself going to you with my feelings I've found you not thinking of me I've built my whole life counting on you You've built your whole life without me Omar. Omar, get back. Why are you doing this to me? Doing what? Calm down and tell me what you saw. You are screwing me up. Do you want me to lose my mind? What am I getting out of this? Calm down and tell me what you saw. - You took her from me again. - I've told you before, - all of that is inside your head. - Enough. I've had enough of you. I won't come here again. You're not treating me, you're killing me. You have the right to object on my methods of treatment. You also have the right to leave and never return. Of course I won't return. Life create coincidences Every heart to its own feeling Suddenly the journey stops And the love gathers the lovers Life create coincidences Every heart to its own feeling Sorry. Suddenly the journey stops And the love gathers the lovers And we've met and this is our time I've seen you with my wishing heart You showed me the heaven And your love filled my days My lifelong dream I woke up with you to a new joy My heart is hugging you and my hand is touching you And the joy made its way to me I hope my life give me more My long-life dream It was a memory from my past It was a picture that would last And from this day on I will sleep and wake up in your arms Because we found comfort in each other And we've dreamt and believed in God We were able to carry on with our love Until we arrived to our dream house Because we found comfort in each other And we've dreamt and believed in God We were able to carry on with our love Until we arrived to our dream house A word I've been saying A life I've been wanting to live Now, I can reach it And my story will start with you My lifelong dream Since when is he like that? Since he came yesterday. I got worried when he didn't answer my calls. I came to check on him, and he won't open the door. - He locks himself. - Try with him, Saleh. Please, Saleh. Try with him. He may open for you. - Okay. - I think of going to that doctor, mom. What he said made me feel like she isn't helping him. It's obvious. He wouldn't be like that if she was doing a good job. Please, Saleh. Try with him. I only want to talk to him, so try to get him to open the door. Alright. Omar, please open. It's Saleh. - How are you, Omar? - As you can see. What then? - Since when will you be like that? - Please, Saleh. I don't want to talk. What you are doing to yourself isn't good, son. You're neither the first nor the last to experience this. Yes, I know. But I can't. She was in my arms, mom. I can't look into her father's eyes. I can't tell him I'm sorry. I don't know why you can't believe I can't. Listen, honey. I will just say this, not because you are my son. I would have said the same thing to anyone else doing what you're doing right now. Honey, if you kept locking yourself, and refuses to accept the reality, you will suffer much more. If you prayed and accepted it, God will give you comfort and heal your heart. Time heals all wounds, son. I can't accept it, mom. And I can't. I swear, I can't. I'm also tired of you constantly worrying about me and keeping an eye on me. I don't know where to go. - I really need to be alone. - You already are, Omar. You are alone. We're just checking in on you. You want to check in on me? I'm not fine, then. I'm messed up, and I can't get over it! Do not worry. I'll never commit suicide. But I need to be alone. Alright, mom. Let's leave him as he wants. He will get over it, if he wants. We're here if you need us, Omar. Me, and mom will not say anything to you when we come. We'll just clean and cook for you. Ali. - I wanted to come to you a long time ago. - Please. Hear me out, please. I've worked hard to be able to come to you. I know how much you love her. I swear, I didn't mean to. I was holding her hand, but she drowned and I didn't mean to. I can't live without her. - I swear I didn't mean to… - Please, son. You have no idea how I feel. I know there's nothing to do, but… Please, don't be upset. This is God's will. This is God's will. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Reem loved you so much, Omar. So much. She loved you so much. I know you was loving her too. - Weren't you? - Yes. I'm not fine without her. Omar, don't forget her. Don't forget her. Take care of yourself. Okay, dear. Thank you. I'm sorry. For what? For being mad in the way I have. I'm sorry. I want to continue our sessions. You will be healed because you have decided to do so. Come on. Omar, I've told you before, everything starts from you. - Right. - Are you ready for today's journey? Yes, I'm ready. Are you ready to accept the consequences and receive your messages? Yes. Do not worry. Let's go. Close your eyes. - Tout est bien? - Yes, all good. - What? You're speaking Arabic? - Yes. I don't know how to start… Is there a problem with coffee? No, not at all. There's another problem. I come here often and see you, I've been wanting to talk to you, but I'm hesitant. I didn't see you the last two times I came. I've decided to talk to you if I see you today. Wow. What's all that? - I'm Hassan. - Fairouz. Hi. I'm a lawyer. If you don't mind, I'd like to get to know you. - Why me? - I don't know Something about you makes me to speak with you. - Something? - Listen. I didn't want to bother you. That's why I'm being direct with you. Yes, but… - Do you have a boyfriend? - No. - Are you married? - No. - You love someone and he doesn't know? - No. - Are you straight? - Yes. That's good then. It's fine to get to know you. The thing is I have work. My shift ends after six hours. I will wait you. Will you wait me here for six hours? You are right. I might cause you trouble. I will be around here, and I will return in time. - Okay. - Okay. Your smile is amazing. I will be back after six hours. What is that? What have you done? - Hassan? - Was it written on my face? Don't you remember me? I'm Malak. - Malak? - Yes. I was your sister's friend in college. - Why did you come here? - For my master's. What are you doing here? I'm here so that students throw their colors on me. I'm really sorry. I didn't see you. Let me clean it. Stop. Stop it. You've made it worse. That's no use. I'll throw it. Looks like I screwed up. The thing is I have an important thing and I have to get changed. What is that important thing? Huh? You can say like… That's none of your business. You are so weird. You have a date. Okay. Alright. By the way, we can buy something from a nearby store - for your date. - No. Thanks. - Let's go. - No, I don't need. You stay, and I'll figure it out. Thank you. I will be right back. Thank you. Hassan. Here you go. - Listen. - What? - I'd like to ask you, but answer honestly. - What? Regarding those beautiful colors you've thrown on me, If I wash my clothes, the colors will disappear? - Of course not. - Really? Thanks very much. Have you known her long? I've been seeing her for a while. But something weird happens each time I try to talk to her, like what happened now. You ruined my clothes. This is a sign. - Will you still go and meet her? - I don't believe in this shit. I know you don't believe in this. - Because you're a Capricorn. - What? How did you know? - My sister must have told you. - Your sister and I didn't get along. Really? Why? Girls do not treat each other in the same way that boys do. Why is that? You feel like the boys have a code. - Maybe. - What do you like about that girl? I liked her. I felt like I wanted to know her better. Even though a Capricorn is discreet, he's adventurous. In relationships, he is a practical person. I'm not adventurous or something. I just liked her, then I talked to her. How are you going to meet someone you don't know? Where is the problem? There's no problem. But there're too many scenarios. - Scenarios? - Maybe she'll rob you with her friends. You watch a lot of movies, don't you? It seems you are new here in Paris. I don't think so. And she doesn't have a boyfriend. How come a pretty girl doesn't have a boyfriend? Or maybe they broke up. How did you know she's pretty? Because you're a Capricorn. I'm starting to hate that word. She must be pretty since you've been waiting for a week to meet her. Not only a Capricorn do that, if anyone saw a pretty girl, he will try to talk to her. That's true. Anyone won't wait for a week, he will go right away to her. That's good I'm a Capricorn. You made me love astrology. What constellation is she? I don't know. I will meet her for the first time. And if it's not the first time, I will never ask her, because it's a feminine question. Is there a separation even in questions? Even in everything. I can know her constellation. - How? - Just few questions. But answer honestly and with no exaggeration. It's good you warned me. Okay. She accepted to meet you from the first time? Of course. Even before I ask her. We said no no exaggeration. She didn't until I made her laugh. Do you've a picture of her? Listen. I took a picture of her without her knowing. I will let you see. - Damn it! - You know her? What's wrong? Is she wanted? She is a Scorpio. She won't meet you. And if she did, she will leave you after first date. But, if she came to second and third date, you will be together. But she'll give you mental disability. - Really? - Yes. You knew all that from her photo? It's not her in the photo, by the way. - Really? - Not, it's her. - How did you know all that? - You will see yourself. Whatever. I'm hungry, let's go eat? I will buy you something very tasty. - Here you go. - Thank you. - I will pay. - Yeah, sure. I've thought about what you said. And I'm not worried, because girls don't speak well about each other. What's that nonsense? I'm sorry I even give you an advice. Advice? You mean warnings. Would a sane person go to a Scorpio and tell her "I like you"? - What should I do? - Listen. The Scorpio lady must be the one who likes and takes the initiative. She keeps following the one she loves and he doesn't care about her. - When will they be together? - That's their way. Nothing can be done. Eat your food. I can't eat after what you just said. Tell her that you can't meet her. You know what? Tell her you feel she isn't excited. She will leave her work and will follow you. Why all that? Really? I feel she's good and nice. You are the good one. You got me into this bad mood. I hope she won't be a Scorpio. - Have I ever told you something wrong? - Ever? I've only met you for 30 minutes. During these 30 minutes, have I told you something wrong? I don't know. - Believe me. - Let's assume everything you said… Oh, damn. I spilled food on myself. - Should I go change again? - No. It's nothing. - Really? - Yes. It's nothing. - See? - Are you left handed? - Yes. Why? - Just asking. Let's assume she's a Scorpio. And I should have talked to her first, what should I do about tonight? It's okay. You can go. Let's go and get flowers. We, girls, are silly and love these things, especially Scorpio women. - No, I won't get flowers. - Come on. I say come on. - Wait. - Come. - Listen to me. - Come. I feel like a fool with these flowers. It's not the flowers that show foolishness. What do you mean? Listen, when you give her the flowers, be grim and serious. Being grim while giving her flowers? Should I throw it at her? What's wrong with you? When was the last time you fell in love? I remember what her constellation was. - You are lying. - How did you know? Because you don't get constellations. Wait. Where are you going? Tell me her birth date, and I will know. It's 5th November. What's up? - Why are you laughing? - I can't. - What's up? - November? - Yes. - She's a Scorpio. - Really? A Scorpio? - Yes. I don't know why it's always a Scorpio. Good thing she left me. What was the most thing you hated about her? She was always criticizing me. Although that was after she's fascinated by my personality, and by my attractiveness, she's constantly lying. You must have loved her so much. I don't know why we have to hide it when we love. I for one when I love someone, I can't hide it. That's what normal people do. You should feel safe in a relationship. - But it's not for everyone. - How is that? I mean, you shouldn't worry about what you look like in front of her. I mean, you don't worry about eating and spilling on yourself, you won't be afraid of her judgment. - There's no one like that. - No. There is. Maybe you didn't meet that one yet. Or maybe you find all that in the girl you are going to meet. And maybe not. Life is all about experience. Try and error. Do not show it until you see her. This is for you. I don't like flowers and all that. Why? What's your constellation? I'm a Scorpio. Scorpio? - This was like a trial to me. - Yes. I will tell you what, I will wait you here. You will back after ten minutes only. You won't stand the time with her. Listen. I'm sure I will spend more time with her. - Do you want to bet? - Yes. But don't get mad or say he left me here. I won't say anything, because you will return after 10 minutes. Okay. Bye. Hassan. - What was that? - Just for good luck. Okay. Fairouz. Sorry I'm late. Were you going to leave? You were a half-hour late. - I'm also late. I have things to do. - Sorry, it was out of my hand. Can we talk while walking? I don't know how to start, but, I feel like I met you before. You can laugh. This is a classic pick-up line. And you must have heard it before. But, honestly, that's how I felt once I saw you. I didn't want to tell you. But, this is the truth. I have felt that way too when I saw you. - Really? - Yes. I feel like we should know each other better. You've been watching me for a long time, why did you decide to talk this time? Did you see me? We all did. Not only me. You were coming for me, and I and all my coworkers knew it. Really? I feel ridiculous. Why didn't you try talking to me? That's not an even a valid question. Because I'm the man and I should ask you first, right? But here, if the girl likes someone, she goes and talk to him. - Of course you didn't like me. - No. That's not the case. - Why then? - Sometimes, people like each other, but… - They can't be together. - Why? Because we come from two different worlds. I don't get it. What's wrong with my world? It's too far away for you. Why don't we create our common world? Why did you agree to see me if that's the case? Because if I didn't agree to see you and tell you that, you'd live thinking we could be together. Isn't there any hope? Can I ask you a question? - What constellation are you? - Aquarius Aquarius? Here's the destiny It did the favors Now, it's up to you First thing in the road of every dream Is a step forward Now isn't a time for silence or talk A life chance waving at me We both dreamt of each other Run and show her yourself A step forward seize it from the world And change your days A step forward What happened? Are you okay? My head's killing me. It's okay. That's because you suddenly got out of session. - I understood. - What? I got the message. I don't want to ask you anything, unless you want to tell me. - I saw someone. - Reem? Yes, but there was another woman with her. I've been seeing her every session. It's impossible to see someone in your dreams who you haven't seen in real life. I think I didn't see her in real life before. - I don't think so. - What is different this time? I felt that Reem said goodbye. She wants me to see someone else. - Where are the apples? - In the fridge. - Oh, God! You surprised me. - Did you see a ghost? - I didn't expect you to come now. - What have you got in your hand? - I'm cleaning your room, brother. - Okay. Omar. - Do you want to have lunch? - Yes. - Really? - Yes. I made all the food that you like. - I'm starving. - Honey. Come, I wanna ask you about someone. - Who? - Sit. Do you remember your classmate, Malak? I want her Facebook account. - Who is Malak? - Listen, children. You didn't like each other. She was blond, white, and a little tall. Why didn't we like each other? I don't know anyone called Malak. This is amnesia. Your daughter got amnesia. - She went to fine arts school with you. - Did I go to fine arts school? Oh, she wasn't with you? No, honey. I went to a commerce school. - A commerce school. - Yes, right. Right. Don't you have a friend named Malak who fits that description? No, I don't. You don't. Try to remember, go to college group or do anything. Remember, Heba. What are you saying, mom? He forgot my college. I'll help you to remember. She is called Malak and she is left-handed. - Left-handed? - Yes. Right. Why are you asking about her? Because… I met her today at the session. Wow. At the clinic? Of course not, mom. I met her in my dream. - In your dream? - Yes. I'll definitely look for her, Omar. You don't have to go to that doctor. There's no progress. Wait, mom. I will look for her. You know what? I will ask all my friends, - maybe someone knows her. - I love you, sister. I love you too. - Will you look for her? - Yes. - I will look for her. - God, help me. - Oh, God. - Get your phone out, and open your Facebook. - Come on, hurry. - Okay, Omar. - Search for Malak. - Okay. Or Alia. - Okay. - Or Mai… You can search yourself, I will go clean up. Mom. Mom. Are you guys there yet? Are you upstairs? You could've said right away. I'm coming. Is there something wrong? I'm sorry, I just… Malak! Malak! Malak. I'm Hassan. - Or Omar. - Or Omar? Look, I'm not Malak, okay? You seem to think I'm someone else. I… I have seen you before. You went up all those stairs to tell me you have seen me before? Yes. Can we go, please? Yes. Thank you. - I want to tell you something. - And I really want to know, but I have a meeting. I have to go. I will wait you. It's six hours. Okay. I will wait you. Will you wait me six hours? Yes. I will wait you six hours. Okay. Hey. Wake up. Omar. Hassan. Whatever your name, wake up. What? - What? - Are you still here? Yes, I'm still here. I've told you I'll wait. I thought you were kidding. No, I was being serious. We can't talk here. - Would you like to go somewhere? - Yes, anywhere. - But I'm not Malak. - Or Mai? - Or… - Enough. No more suggestions. - I'm Hana. - Hana? How come? Like anyone named Hana. What constellation are you? - Why are you laughing? - You're so weird. Why? - Because it's a feminine question. - That's what I've said. I'm a Libra. - Libra? Not a Scorpio? - No. - Are you left-handed? - No, I'm not. What's your story? Let's start from the beginning. - I'm Omar. How are you? - Hi, Omar. About seven or eight months ago, my wife died when we're on our honeymoon. I was so shocked and went to see a doctor. She was doing a strange treatment, I was hypnotized and see my wife. Strangely, I've seen you more than once. Have you seen me? Check, please.
