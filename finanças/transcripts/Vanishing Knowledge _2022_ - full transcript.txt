November 19th, 1971. At the age of 19, Frank Combs returned from serving in the Vietnam War an addict with PTSD. Surviving at home in the United States became a battle for Frank. To make matters worse, the exposure to Agent Orange led to his cancer diagnosis. Frank was looking to make something out of his life. He and his brother, Leo, decided to buy the Nokota horses from the Theodore Roosevelt National Park. Frank instantly realized these Nokota horses were special in the way they behaved around humans. These horses, after all, were descendants of Chief Sitting Bull's horses. They were treated like family by the horse-centered culture of the Hunkpapa tribe. Which allowed them to interact with humans unlike any other breed. Frank healed from the addictions and felt that he could better cope with his PTSD when he was around these special, horses. Today, Frank has the largest Nokota herd in the world. He continues to protect them and their legacy. Yeah, Frank, I think it's time to move them horses. Let's do it in the morning. Good morning. How are you doing? I'm doing fine. You, uh, ready to round them up? Get them down to that soft pasture? Oh, yeah. Well, let's get "er done. We got, uh, a lot of day left. This way. This way. C'mon. Let's go. I just talked to Christine the other day and... uh, told me she's got three students that want Nokotas of their own and this way at least I know they'll have a good home and, uh... we'll just haul them with us when we go out to the fundraiser. That sounds like a good plan. Um, before we go to the fundraiser, you have time to sit with me and a, uh, do a little paperwork and we can figure out, uh... um, a bill for where you're boarding horses on my land. It's been about three or four months since we did that and, uh, you know, there's just a lot of expenses with equipment and supplies, and you know, hired help, everything, you know, just to get a little money would be real handy right now before I head out that way. I promise you, Paul, my next VA check will go to my bill towards here. I appreciate that. I wish hay supplier Brock was as understanding as you are. Hey, buddy. C'mon. Here you go. My little friend. Yeah, come on. Oh! Come on, bud. Buddy, hi! How are you? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Lacy, honey, we're going to have fun with the horses at Christine's today, right, honey? Here they come. - Christine? - Hey, Lisa! Hi! We spoke on the phone. Yes, nice to meet you! Thank you, you too. And this is Lacy. Hi, Lacy! Lacy, we're here to have fun with the horses. Well, I'm sorry we're a tad early, so if you want I can pull up - and wait in the car? - You know what? We can get started with the session if you want to go ahead down and, uh, park and just meet me in the ring. Sounds great. This is going to be fun, honey. Lacy? It's her gloves, she forgot her gloves. - I'm going to go get them. - Okay. Okay. It's okay, Lacy, mommy's going to get your gloves. Uh-oh. Okay. Hey, Lacy. Honey, it's okay. It's okay. Okay, okay. Ah. It's okay. Do you want to pet Rabbit? - It's okay. - Time to visit with Rabbit? Oh! There you go. So, if she has them with her she's... Once she's got them on her, she'll be okay. Got it. Mm-hmm. Okay. It's okay, baby. - Here you go. - There. All good. Comfort. Oh. Say hello to Rabbit? He would love to say hello to you. Hello. Dad inside? - Hey, Krista. - Morning, Dad. Oh, just fixing stuff. - Where's Beckett? - He's at home with his dad. What's going on with the money again? This is the second time you've called me this year to ask for money. I promise I'll pay you. Right after Christine's fundraiser. I'm sorry I gotta keep borrowing from you... but I have to pay Paul. I thought this was for Brock. I have to pay Paul first. Without Paul's land, there's nowhere for the horses to go. So, I'll pay Brock after Christine's fundraiser. My entire childhood I've watched you borrow money to take care of these horses. But, what have you gotten in return? It's time to take care of yourself now. When's the last time you were at the doctor? I was there yesterday for my monthly chemo. You know how I get afterwards. I know it's tough. I'm late for work. I gotta go. Oh, Brock called me. He was asking if maybe you could sell Otto to him for payment of the hay? You need to get a hold of him. So, are we going to rebuild all of the dams? Well, we'll see how much time we got. You know, see what the weather does. But, uh, yeah, we're gonna try to get them all done. Yeah, I know, that's why I'm saying, we're already combining late at night... Yeah, well that's one of the jobs, but the other job is, we gotta take care of these horses. 'Cause this has gotta be about six feet deeper here, to make sure the water lasts all winter. Those horses are gonna need it. Who's that calling you this early in the morning? Just one of them telemarketers. Hey, y'all. Studs are fed. So, you ready to go make hay? You're on your own today, Jen. Frank's babysitting Beckett. - I am? - Yeah. Great, so we'll have to call Brock again for hay. I don't get to spend much time with my grandson. We'll get 'er done one way or another. You're the boss. Don't get all upset at me if there's not enough hay this year. Dang it! My gosh! Why can't we just get some better equipment? I got you! I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it in my boot. I see that. Mama's still there. Mom! Mommy! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Love you! Love you. Brock called me today. Why aren't you answering his phone calls? Okay, buddy, we gotta go. See you, Dad. Love you. Bye. Morning, Otto. You and I are not as young as we used to be. Not only that, but our herd is growing and... so are their needs. How about you and I go check up on them herd, hm? Wanna go with me? I'd love to have you, buddy. Love you. Jordan and I could've done this. I seen that hair hanging on the fence, that got pulled out of them horses. Hope that didn't hurt them much. Yeah. - That structure ready? - Yeah. Okay, Paul. Paul, I don't know any other landowners who do all the fencing themselves. You know? Just trying to figure out what your love is for the horses that we're out here doing Frank's work. Is this the silent treatment now? We got work to do. When you send us out for the cattle and the cattle break fences, you send me and Jordan out by ourselves. But for the horses, you want to be here. What's so special about these horses, Paul? I'll tell you what, Ben. Let's just get this job done... get down to the yard and we'll load that up with grain. Let's load them tools up. We got work to do. All right. - There you are. - Thanks. Truck's over here, Paul. - Got everything? - Yeah. All right. - Touch it. - Oh! There you go! Good job! - Move the bucket. - Touch it. Doing really good. She loves you. Touch it. Listen, buddy, we have to take off. There's somewhere we need to go. You're doing really well. - Touch it. - Touch it. Oh! - Amazing! - Hey. She really loves you. - It's okay. Okay. - You're a total horseman. - Michael's friend. - Yes, absolutely. - We'll be back to see her. - No. This is not the last time you will see her. - I promise. - No. No. It's okay. It's okay. You did so good. Gina's Michael's friend. Yeah? Yeah? Yeah! How about it? - Gina's Michael's friend. - Yeah. - You did good, brother. - Gina is Michael's friend. Yup. She loves you. Amazing. He's doing great with this. He really is. We're going to do so much more. Oh, good, good. He loves it. He looks forward to it every time. - Good! - Yes. - Good. - So... Oh. We looked forward to it, right, Mikey? - You did good, brother. - Oh. Yeah. 'Cause Gina is Michael's friend. Good job. You have a great rest of your day. Thank you. You did really good. I'm very proud of you. Where's our friend, Rabbit? Good girl! I think Nebba is starting to really bond with Lacy. She seems... Lacy seems really comfortable with her. I can't tell you how happy it makes me. We have seen absolutely amazing changes happening with Lacy. That's great, and you'll continue to see improvement. I can't always predict what's going to happen in the session, but, um, it's... it's really kind of magical to watch. I didn't have a choice with Lacy, but what made you choose this path? All right, Paul's money. Now, we just gotta find Brock's money. All right. Frank's here. Oh. Okay. Let's get this done, slick. Yeah. I'm tightening. Hey, Paul. Frank, I'll tell you... your horses got it made here. They keep us working all day. Actually, they were once Sitting Bull's horses. They were almost wiped out once. I'm just taking care of them. You mean I am. Oh, Jesus. He acts like he's a worker, you know? What are you up to today? Oh, I just came by to give you your monthly checks. Sorry, I'm late. Hey, I appreciate it, man. That, uh, come in handy. Got a lot of bills and... a lot of upkeep out here and stuff, so... But, uh... takes a lot to take care of everything. By the way, horses are looking amazing. Good. Really great set of horses and, uh... you're doing a good job of making them survive and keeping them organized. A lot of people will appreciate it many years down the road, so. Nice set of horses you got there. Actually, they're Sitting Bull's horses. Oh, boy. When does it end? Gotta get that last word in all the time, so, you know? All right, I got some work I gotta get done. I'll see you guys later. I can't blame you for leaving there, Frank. Take care. Have a good day. Hey, Brock. Why are you not answering my calls? I hate chasing you down for money. I... I promise you, I'll pay you soon. Did you think I was gonna forget about it? I could take him as part of the payment. He's... he's part of my family. He's part of me. Are you going to need more hay this winter? Make sure I get my money, Frank. You know, Otto, you're the only one that gets apples. Buddy, you know, my VA shots are getting... harder and harder on me every month. I know. I say, Frank, you're late. Is everything okay? Huh. Listen, Frank. Are we haying today? Uh, you are. I've got to go to... the veterans' hospital to get my monthly cancer shot. Oh. Well, why are you here? Paul called and said he thought there was an injured colt out here. Oh, well, I could have come by myself. I know, but I... I need to see it myself. I need to check it myself. Mr. Kuntz, the doctor will see you now to go over your lab results. Hey, honey. How was your doctor visit? What'd he say? Honey, you're scaring me. What did the doctor say, honey? What are we going to do about our horses? The horses will be taken care of. We'll make sure of that. Please tell me what the doctor said. She's getting so much better. We are so proud of her. Mom! My! My! My! My! My! My! My! My! My! My! My! It's o... It's okay, it's okay. Buddy, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. You're okay. It's okay. It's okay, buddy. Hey, Mom, are you okay? I mean, I am worried about the client. It's helping them. Everything is going well, I think. Hey. - Morning. - Morning. What are you writing? Oh, I just want to make sure we don't lose any information about the Nokota horses. That's a good idea. What am I gonna tell the girls? I don't want them to worry. They need to know, Frank. You have to tell them. Krista's coming in this morning. I'd like to be able to talk to Paul and Christine first. The horses have been on Paul's land for a very long time. Do you think he'll let them stay? I would hope so. Without land... there aren't many options for the horses. We should tell Krista everything. I don't know why you guys like mornings in this barn. We need to talk. I don't have any more money to loan you. That's not what you're here for. Dad, I don't have it. It would've helped if you would have asked Paul for more time. Then, you could've taken the check I gave you and settled with Brock for the hay. My cancer has spread. The doctors aren't giving me much time anymore. What? When did you find out? You've been fighting this for 20 years. There's nothing else that they can do? There's no other medicine? They can't do anything else? You can't leave us right now. I need you. Beckett needs you. Hey, Frank. How are you doing? - I'm fine, Paul. - Come on up. Have a chair. Enjoy the view. Beautiful evening out here tonight. Oh, I knew that you would be here. Oh, yeah. I understand the love you have for your land. I'm pretty fortunate, uh... it's a blessing, I just, uh, hope my grandkids and their grandkids, and everybody for the next generations get to enjoy it like I have, you know? Well, that's what I want to talk to you about. I just come from the doctor and... um, things don't look good. The cancer's spread to my bones. So, what are they saying? They... What's... What's the plan or... What do they think is all happening? I... I just have to be smart about it and make sure... make sure everybody's taken care of. Um, boy, what can I do to help, Frank? Or, you know, is there something that can be done, or does your family... Everything okay with your family and stuff or... Have you talked to them? I'm just worried about my horses, Paul. They almost were extinct at one time and I just ain't gonna let that happen again. I can't blame you, Frank. You've put too much into it. I don't know if you, uh, spoke to anybody else about this or anything, you know, have you contacted anybody like Christine or... Oh, they need a home and I'm looking for a 50 year lease for these horses on your land, um... that's what I want to talk to you about. Boy. That's a... That's a big commitment. They uh... um, man I hope... I don't even know if I'm gonna be around 50 years. I'm probably gonna have to... depend on my grandkids and my kids to carry that on, but you know I'm gonna have to talk to Barb and see what they have to say about it. If I'm here I'll be glad to do it, but uh... you know there's other... Others things could come up, you know? Yeah. After me... they'll have no place to go. These horses. Yeah, you guys. This is your home. - I'm home! - Paul! You're home earlier than usual. Yeah, I thought I'd get home a couple hours earlier tonight. It's 9:30 already, so, what's happening? Not too much. Good to see you. Good to see you. What are you up to? - Reading my book. - All right, perfect. It was a little dirty out there today. Dusty. Oh, it's good to sit down. One of them days. How was your day? I had a good day. How about you? Frank heard from his doctors and uh, the cancer's into his bones. A lot to uh, just have them there. And... and the exposure that they, uh, will be bringing I mean. Okay, stop here. You're gonna have to drive it. Can you drive? Can you close the hood? Can you push that? Not yet. We're here. Hi! Come on in. - Hi, mom. - Hello. Hi. What's up? Oh, we just wanted to talk to you about something. Fit in your car. Oh! Well, I got to go talk to your mother so, you guys all, I'll catch you later. - Come on, guys. - Okay. See you guys. - Have a good day. - Bye, Grandpa! - See you, Paul. - This way. - Hi, guys. - Hi. - How are you guys doing? - Good. So, what's this about? Well, thanks for coming girls. Uh, last night, Dad shared some very upsetting news with me and we wanted to let you know what's happening down at the farm. Okay, so what's going on? Is everyone okay? Frank got news from his doctor and physicians he works with that they uh... His cancer he has spread to his bones. They don't know how long he has, but it doesn't sound good. The big thing is is when Frank is gone... these horses are going to be homeless. He's looking at us... to do 50 year commitment with our farm and ranch to take care of these horses. 50 years is a really long time. That's a big commitment. Yeah. You're talking about affecting the next two or three generations of our family. These horses are gonna end up homeless. I don't know. I think we should try or do something. Paul, you can't expect the girls to make a commitment like that. They've done... so much for me. You guys don't even understand how much they've helped me. Dad, I don't think anybody's denying that. We just have our own careers and families that we need to be looking out for too. The thought of those beautiful Nokota horses being homeless is gut-wrenching. But, I don't know if this is a problem that you can fix. I think this is a time when you need to put your family first. And the time. The time commitment that this takes. I think about how much you're down at the farm now and this on top of it. The kids want to see you. Your grandkids want to be around you. And I feel like every time they say, "Mom, is Grandpa going to be there?" I have to say, you're down at the farm. They just want to be around their grandpa. Well... I think we're going to make a decision here today. I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to take from the kids. I don't want to take from you guys. I don't know what to do. And ask her to stop. Awesome! How did that feel? Oh, it's Frank. I was just about to call you. Hey, Christine. I just got to share some big news with you. Look at that. Awesome! What? Let's do that again. Try to be little bit more balanced this time. Mom, are you okay? No, it's Frank. The doctors haven't given him much time. Erin, is it okay if we end the session early today? Yeah. Is it the Nokota horse Frank? Yeah, it is. What's going to happen to his herd? Where are they gonna live? I don't know what's going to happen to his herd. - Hey, Brock. - Frank. Do you have my money or do I need to come take your black horse as part of the payment? I'll get yo... I'll get you your money, I promise. Okay. I run a business here too, Frank. You have until the end of the week to pay me my money or I'm gonna come and get your horse. All right. So, how's this going, Ben? Oh, pretty good. I'm almost finished up here and... Look what I found on Frank the other day. You won't believe this. Here. - Yeah, I know. - That's cool. I didn't know that Frank's been fighting his whole life - to save this horse breed. - Yeah. Heck, him and Leo they, uh... started this back in the '70s after they got back out of the service and stuff and they have been, you know, like, breeding them, feeding them, nurturing them, um... getting this herd back to a state of survival. You know, so... What's so special about these horses though? Oh, they're real people horses. Good job. Say hi to Indie at the end. Lacy is doing so well. I'm thrilled. Ah, I can tell. It's been amazing watching the changes in her. We've seen so many improvements in Lacy. Great. That's great. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. There is one thing that I've been so excited to talk to you about. Um, her dad and I have been talking about getting her a Nokota horse. - Oh my gosh, that's awesome! - Yeah. Great. Well, whatever I can do to help you make that happen, that's wonderful. We definitely know we want to get the horse from Frank. First of all, Frank will be thrilled, because you know, every horse placed right now means the world to him. Um, its been really rough the last couple of years. - I understand. - Mhm. Yeah. Oh, Lacy. Come here, sweetheart. I love this girl. Gonna have your own... Aw. It's going to be a great journey for you guys. Oh. Thank you so much. You're welcome. I love this girl. Good job! Yeah. Nice. Right to me. Perfect. That was really good. All the way around. Good job! Slide to me. Perfect. Perfect. That was really good! - Good job. - Good boy. Thank you. I know, that was fantastic! Good job, buddy. Good job. Hey, Brock. Frank, I need you to sign this. It's a bill of sale for the horse for partial payment of the money you owe me for the hay. I promise you, I'll get it to you somehow. I've given you enough time. Please, he's the only friend I have. No. I really want that horse. I could use him. Don't come to me to buy hay ever again. He loves apples. So, I looked at the weather forecast, hun, and it's supposed to be pretty chilly out there, so, make sure you pack some long sleeve shirts. So, the three of you are going to put your heads together and try to come up with a solution for the horses? That's the main reason I'm going out there. Um... We gotta... we gotta figure something out for these horses, uh... You know, but if we don't figure this out... I got a bad feeling. Well, I'll be thinking of the three of you while you're brainstorming and hoping for the best. It's gonna be a big chore. Here, let me do it. I can do it myself. I ain't no cripple. I know you're not a cripple and I'm not trying to give you sympathy, I just... I can get it done faster. It's totaled. You're gonna have to call Paul. If not, how the heck am I gonna make hay when you're at a fundraiser in Pennsylvania? - Paul here. - Hey, Paul. We can't travel to the fundraiser today. Some of my shit machinery broke down here and I gotta get my hay down, so... any chance I could come and borrow some of yours? That's a shame I was looking forward to seeing you at the fundraiser. But yeah, I got a tractor here and I can get that hooked up on that rig, and I'll throw the keys in it. All right, Paul. I'll talk to you later. Thanks. Bye. He said okay? Hello? Hey, Frank! How are you? I'm fine, Christine, and you? I'm doing great, I just wanted to give you a call 'cause everybody here is excited about the new horses coming. How are they doing? My tractor broke down and I won't be able to make it to the fundraiser on time. We'll be there with the horses a day later. Oh, yeah Frank, you know, it sounds important. Um, you know what, I actually do have to run because I have another session coming up. Can I give you a call after that? All right, Christine. Love you. Love you too, Frank. Bye. Tractor ready to go, Paul? I'm one step ahead of you this time, Frank. I got everything in the back of your truck already. How about you? I had packed the day before already. I hope Christine's okay with the fact that we're late for the fundraiser. Maybe we should have left sooner, you know um, she'll understand, you know? We're doing the best we can. Oh! Hey, hey. Give it back, buddy. Give it back. We're so proud of you, Lacy. Here you go. Peter, I'll be right back. You finally made it! Hey, Frank. Hey, Christine. How are you? Hey! Wait a minute, wait! Where's Paul? Oh, he decided at the last minute - he couldn't make it. - Oh, no. We were all looking so forward to seeing him. Shoot. Oh, wait a minute, I should've known better. Hi, Paul. - Good to see you. - Good. - How are you doing? - Oh, good. - How was your trip in? - Not bad. - Okay. - Good drive. - Pretty drive. - Yeah. How's things out here for you guys? Um, good, I'm a little exhausted, but um, you know, it's all good. I mean this is... This is the time of year. So, you had a big event last night. Yeah, we did. We had our annual fundraiser here. So, how'd the fundraiser go? Um, honestly, Frank, it could've been a little better. Um, this has been a tough year for everybody, I think, but uh, you know, we're not gonna give up, you know, we'll keep going. You know, it's a... It may be a small portion, but, you know, it means a lot to the people out here. Yeah. It's really appreciated, you know, like you said. Good or bad. It always covers a portion of what we use out there. These horses are amazing! He is so beautiful. Yeah. Your horse is here, Lacy! Oh, wow! Wow! You can play with them tomorrow, Lacy. Thank you. Thank you. You cannot imagine how much these horses have done for Lacy. I wish we could do this for so many more people. - Yeah. - Thank you. Um, if you guys have a minute, uh... it seems like Donna in town and I'd really like to introduce you guys Um, if you can stay an extra day. Uh, Donna has a very generous spirit and has a huge heart for these horses and I think it would be an important time to sit with her, um, if you can. Yeah, it's good for the horses and me. You know, I have the time, yeah. Okay. Great. Thanks. No problem with me. Whatever it takes. Okay. Hey, Lacy. You wanna go in? Should we go in together? Here we go, buddy. Here we go. You'll be next, buddy. Lacy, honey, we have to go now. We'll come back soon, okay? Michael. Michael. Michael. Michael. Michael. - Hi, Christine. - Hey, hi, Paul. - How are you today? - Great! - Here sit down. - Frank, it's your chair. So, Christine, just out here having some time to yourself? Yeah. It feels good. - Here's Donna. Hey, Donna. - Wow. Hey, have any room for me up there? Hi, how are you doing? - Good. You must be Paul. - I am. So glad to meet you. Hi, Frank. How are you? I'm fine. Nice to see you Donna. Same here. You know, I've heard you've, uh, done a lot for the Nokota horses already, you know, and, uh, it's greatly appreciated, but there's a lot to get done out there yet. You know, we could use some help out there. Paul, I don't know if you know that I have 14 Nokotas and I know how much work it takes. I would love to come and help you. It's really appreciated, so, thank you. You know, we all want to help, um, that's why I'm so happy that Donna and Paul are here and maybe we can come up with a plan while they're in town. I had spoken to Paul already about a 50... At least a 50 year commitment on some land, but... you know, it's just we need land. I know, Frank, maybe now's the time that we... I let you know that my one daughter... She just wants me to have more time with them and her kids... and my grandkids so, uh... you know, this is a thing that isn't gonna help. My other daughter doesn't know if she wants to commit her kids and their kids for three generations to do this and they have no say on the matter. And at this point... um, there really isn't a plan. My God, Christine. What are we gonna do? We have to do something. I hate this. You guys gotta let me help. Frank, you've been doing this for 40 years, helping the Nokota horses. It's our turn to do our part. Paul, is all this gonna fit? Uh, well, if it doesn't... you're gonna have to bring it to Montana or North Dakota or where you want to go with it all by yourself. How does that sound? Christine doesn't go out west in the winter time. Oh, Christine. Whoa! Frank, we have the fundraiser to thank for all this hay. I know it's not much but... Well, I know it's not enough, but I'm very grateful for it, and unfortunately I'm going to need a lot more, but every little bit's gonna help. I know. All right, that one you bring. Okay, that one I'll put in the back of my truck. But, I gotta tell you, I cannot stop thinking about these 300 horses and what's gonna happen to them. I don't know what would happen to this herd. Paul's in the same position I am. I know he wants to help, but I understand 300 horses are huge, and that's a huge family commitment, and they can't do it, so I'm not sure what to do. They need our brains to come together and figure something out. The last thing I want to see is these horses are going to slaughter. They've been there for us and I can see it on a therapeutic level more than ever. I feel like it's the least we can do for them. Christine, that's what I want to do too. I wanna do this at my ranch in Colorado. When will Grandpa be here? Yeah, Mom. How long do we have to wait? Pretty soon, guys. Okay. Home sweet home. Hey, Grandpa. Hey, Grandpa. We missed you. - Hey, hun, how you doing? - Good to see you. Hey, Frank, you need help with anything? No, I'll be okay. See you later. All right, you take care. I'll see you. I'll give you a call. How'd the fundraiser go? Oh, boy. It was horrible. I don't know what he's gonna do. What can we do to help him? I don't know. I don't know. Grandpa, I'll take care of Frank's horses. Me too! Hi. Can I get you something to eat, honey? You must be so tired. Or maybe you want to clean up first? The fundraiser didn't go so well. Why? What happened? It went so well last year. I'm not sure, just not that many people showed. We'll make it work. You always make it work, hun. Why don't you clean up and relax a little bit? It'll be okay. Hey Ben, come over here. We're going to break the ice in this area where the horses come down. So, they don't have to be in the middle here, and, uh, it'll be safer for them. - So... - Yeah. Paul, seriously. What happened in Pennsylvania? As you know, the fundraiser didn't go well, you know, and, uh... everybody's, uh, kinda holding back. Nobody has any extra money with the times are. Are they gonna be homeless when he passes? I don't see a solution yet. The more I read about these "kill buyers", the more worried I get about Frank's horses. Yeah. Have you seen Frank's hay piles? Yeah, it's very low. Yeah. He doesn't get a break. It's been going on his whole life. I missed you, Grandpa! I missed you too, buddy. - Hi, hun. - Hi, guys. Dad, how was your trip? How was your trip, Dad? I'll get your money somehow. I need to pay Paul first. You've always figured it out. I know you'll get me my money. What is that? That's my journal. Everything I know about the horses in here and you care these horses in the future. It's about time he let somebody else help. I'll take care of the horses for you, Grandpa. Just in time. Honey. After all these years... you think we made the right choice in getting a larger VA check and not doing your full cancer treatments? We needed all the money we could get to help save these horses. And who will save the horses now?
