Later my parents went away from me I dont even remember their faces I have seen them only in photo My mother didn't let me come here till she was alive.. After her death, many a time I felt like coming here to see dad During that time only, I saw this article in the newspaper By the way, one more thing... I have a friend Kumar from this place in Bangalore... ...knowing that I am coming here, he has entrusted me a task I was told that his house in this village has been vacant for 3 to 4 years That house & the site has to be sold... ...he told me to enquire about it Before coming here we went to that house and came Come... The place is a bit dirty... It's Ok Who did all this? As you have come here to know about your father ...to understand everything about him... ...you have to know about this I enquired some people about my dad, and they said many things What really happened to my dad?... ...is what all I heard true? Salutations to Lord Vignesh and Goddess Saraswathi... Harsha... (Yakshagana song in the background...) Uncle.... ...let there be many defensive formations like Chakravyuha... ...I will ensure that Pandavas army will come victorious ...Abhimanyu is going with enthusiasm Ignite my enthusiasm with oil & lamp and send me off to battlefield I myself will tell about him He is Mohana... ...had his own jeep... ...the beetle nuts, cashews grown here... ...were reaching the market in his jeep Greetings sir... ...greetings... ...Vijay has not come? He has gone for some wedding... ...he has weighed the beetle nut and sent He will come tomorrow and collect money Is it you? Give me some money atleast I have scheduled an important work today... ...if that work gets completed... ...I will give you more than this. If I steal money from my brother's pocket, what is wrong? Isn't it? (Beetlenut godown) I have been planning to visit Murudeshwar for a long time... ...knowing about this... ...the workers in my shop have planned a two day trip ...if someone comes here and say that they will send beetle nuts..., ...please say no... ...no one will be here. They will all leave this evening itself You are as beautiful as a flower, who are you, lovely lady? who are you, lovely lady? What is your name? ... Who are your parents? You are the matchless beauty on this earth ...Who are you lovely lady? ...lovely lady, lovely lady... How long you have been doing this without even telling me? Who is she, where is her house, I dont know anything... ...for the last two weeks, wherever the Yakshagaana takes place... ...she was coming every day to watch She was looking at me only I am scared of talking to her... ...if she leaves before I remove my makeup, how can I talk to her? That's all? When she has come to watch Yakshagaana... ...she has to look at the artist and not the singer, right? Hey... I was joking... How long will you take to speak to her? Uma, how long it has been since I saw you! I was coming here... ...but for couple of days... ...I was going back after seeing my parents I could not roam around the town, from now on I will be here only That's Ok... We are tired of telling your father, at least you could tell him, right? Mom, at least you could have told me... ...that Shambu Shetty is like that? Uma... - I dont know dad... ... tell Shambu Shetty tomorrow itself that you are not coming to work now on Do you believe what people in village talk about him? What else dad...? ...entire village is talking that he is half mad They say that you will also get mad working with that person the whole day Is this not enough for me to get scared? The people in the village never tried to understand him Because one person talks, others also talk... ...like you To the outside world, he is a big novelist, ...but to the people of this village... Knowingly or unknowingly, we should not cause any sort of pain to others... He was saying that if all of us have this attitude, our place would be heaven Within 5 to 6 years of his marriage... ...his wife separated from him with the son For now he does not have any one, but me If he saw ants, he would feed them with sugar... ...and if he saw birds in his garden, he feeds them with grains... ...else he would sit near the river and keep watching the fish... ...whatever may happen, your dad was not missing out these deeds Take this... ...put it in water... ...to eat it, the fish will come competing with each other... ...looking at them, you can ease your boredom Try it out once... ...you will enjoy it more than fishing He used to cut nose threads of cows ...untie the ropes of any animal that is tied up... ...if he comes across fishing net, he would cut it and throw away ...people came to put up fight... ...hearing him, they thought he is half mad For a long time, he has not written even a single novel... ...he wanted to leave the house and village... To where? Not to any specific place... ...he wanted to get relieved from life... ...and wanted to wander without direction Sir... - Hm... ...read it The way you assert on non-violence in depth in your novels... ...I like it very much Reporters had written in paper about you after talking to village people recently... ...that you are half mad... ...and they have said that you behave and act strangely We, your fans, know that is all false... ...but we dont know why the people of your village have said so... ...we are very much interested to know more about you ...so, you have to write your autobiography like other novelists... ...that will give perfection to your literary life ...and that will fulfill our desire too In most of these letters.... ...people have requested for your autobiography, sir Hm... I want to get relieved of everything... ...that being the case... ...should I be writing again? That too autobiography... ...writing about myself... Why do you think so sir? Thousands of people are waiting to know more about you... ...and you want to go for spirituality Even if you go there... ...the non-accomplishment will not give you peace of mind If I start writing, it will take two or three years... I am about to go, leaving everything... ...and I should not create anything new Oh Satyabhame, come Satyabhama... Show me your cute face Come on, Satyabhama... Show me your cute face Oh lady, I am suffering from the loss of your love Hello kids... ...your sister's ring had fallen near the theatre and you have not seen? I wanted to talk to you... Brother, stop the vehicle, brother stop, stop... Oh... beetle nut bag... Oh!... two more bags...? Brother, brother... ...two more beetle nut bags have fallen somewhere I told you earlier... ...that I will tie the rope... ...you did not listen to me Brother, they would have fallen closeby... ...we will go and check - no we cannot go back Dont know where it has fallen... ...if we dont go fast, the shop would be closed Get on to the vehicle Sister, come we will go there Come quietly - no I will not come You were laughing at me day before yesterday, right? I have to talk to you Tell me where we can meet Tomorrow I will take all of you to the beach to play... ...so you will come at least now? - Hm When you first played the Yakshagana character, were you tensed up like now? No When you failed in first PUC? - No Ok, when you learnt about my jeep accident during last Deepavali festival? Hm?... No Your name? Uma - I knew it I had heard from the children You dance very well I like your costume very much Oh, my costume!? Same with me... I like your interest in Yakshagaana I had told the children that you will give me the ring and that I will bring it... ...where is that ring? It is not there now Ok, I will leave now Uma.. It is not just your costume... ...I like you also Drizzles of love is pouring on my heart incessantly My heart is flying with wide spread wings Whenever she smiles, it is the time for the flowers of love to blossom Moon and her beauty are competing to overshadow each other what an amazing feeling, I am flying over the skies My breath and heart beat are raising and moving hapazardly Drizzles of love are pouring on my heart incessantly Sir... Sir... ...since two years we have been yearning to feel the exitement we are eagerly waiting for your next novel. Your ever sincere admirer. Shambu, your dad who had gone for hunting has come... That day the pride of winning the war was seen in father's face... ...in every one's mind... ...sympathy, humanity will be there sub consciously... ...but they had been defeated in father... ...violence, cruelty are not real victory Lakshmi... call Shambu for lunch He said he is not hungry, he is sleeping You know how people are these days... ...if they see just a smile on the face... ...they will be thinking to cheat a year's lease amount... ...that being so... ...your son should grow like a tiger He is still a young boy In his age I used to insist that I would go with my dad for hunting As he grows, he will become like you You had asked for the ring, right I need to talk to you at length Here? ...oh... I had it Then where else? If you know how to run the float... ...there is a way When the heart opens the doors -two souls are yearning to move ahead... ... and moving through an endless pathway on a wonderful journey when love blossoms, a new world is born a new poetry takes birth with the touch and feel of love and happiness Drizzles of love is pouring on my heart incessantly I had never lied to my mother like this For a good cause, there can be thousand lies Ok, will your parents agree? Mom will agree... ...but father may feel little bad Why? Dad works in Shambu Shetty's house... ...even if he doesn't show outside, he will have the feeling within, right? So my dad would tell often... ...after marriage his daughter should be getting work done by people... ...and seeing that he should feel happy His thinking is right... ...but this artiste can't do more than earning for food and shelter No, father will agree. I will convince him Last week dad had come with Shambu Shetty to watch Yakshagaana I learnt that both of them liked your act If the hunting craze grips once, enough... ...come with me today atleast No dad You are not respecting your dad's words? I had kept quiet all these days because I have the respect Kept quiet, means what? Dad, the very route of your thinking is wrong It's not just hunting... ...It's wrong to show our arrogance on any body... ...be it a human being or animal Dont talk rubbish because you are educated... ...hunting for food is not a crime Hunting for food is not a crime, dad... ...hunting to please the tongue & for fun is not right Now you are going for that only Because he did not get any prey... ...or because of anger with me... ...he did not come home for two days Came to know later that he had gone to the tiger's den in the forest On the third day he came with such a pride, not seen earlier Because... ...that day his hunt was... ...not for food To get firewood or to graze cattle... ...people were scared to go to forest... ...the tiger which was the reason for their fear... ...became a prey for my father's hunting Female tiger... it even had cubs... Sad... ...dont know where those cubs go... ...what they eat... ...they wont have the strength to hunt... ...and no mother to feed them You will never chanage... ..that's why those giving lease money say.. ...if father dies, they can breathe easy with his son That means you are torturing them that they can't even breathe Why all that dad?... ...let them give the lease amount however much they can... ...why fight over it get You are preaching me? Those who dont have wisdom, have to be preached My father did not talk to me for two years He did not even see my face Look, I am telling you today... ...he is not my son at all, I have no son at all... ...I will not see his face till I die His health deteriorated and was bedridden But even then... ...he did not call me near him Once... at least once, take the rifle and go to the forest... ...hunt atleast a wild hen and come... ...your father's anger will come down Shambu... Shambu... For me it was a wonder... ...after two and half years, dad had called me by my name Shambu... ...I will not live for long my son... ...can you fulfill my last wish? Yes dad... tell me what it is You take the rifle and go to forest now... ...hunt a rabit, or any animal and bring The meat brought by my son should be cooked in our house... ...all our labourers... ...should enjoy the lunch praising my son Son, please fulfill his wish... ...after that you can live the way you want Be like Buddha, no one will ask you We had got a rabit, but Shambu did not shoot at all Father was bedridden for long time... But... ...why did he die the same day when I returned empty handed from hunting? Dad died because of me only... ...it's not just me who felt so... My daughter had misunderstood you... ...I gave her one of your novels to read After reading it, she has become your fan.. ...today also I am taking a novel, ok? What is the progress on your autogiography? I have written till one stage... ...I can't write any more Because of me dad suffered... ...and at the end, his death also... Dad wanted me to be a strong hearted man Gun in the hand, look for a good catch in the forest and be a good hunter I will be... ...if I fulfill his last wish... ...I can get relieved from this life fully Dad had hunted tiger... ...even I have to hunt You were performing tiger dance 10 years ago, right... Yes... I had liked your costume and dance very much Hari was to put up tiger costume and spend couple of hours in an island Shambu Shetty was to fill his gun with dummy bullets... ...search Hari in those couple of hours and shoot him Hari was to escape from his sight and from the aim of the gun Instead of dodging his boss... ...Hari could have come in the sight of Shambu Shetty sooner... ...then Shambu Shetty would have easily hit the target Then how could it seem to be real hunting? Hm... Shetty had found a solution even for that Though you are poor... ...you did not take any help that I could have done to you... ...you were always telling that it would look like begging... But this hunting is like a competition to you Winning in a competition... ...will never be alms... ...it will be a prize If Hari escapes from the gun's aim... ...Shambu Shetty had told that he would give Hari two years' salary... The animal that runs to escape the aim of the gun... ...man who runs behind money... ...according to me, both their speeds are same The animal dies if hit by the bullet... ...and here if the bullet hits you, you will not get the money If there is no money... ...these days... ...though alive, is as good as dead Then both are same right? If everything happens as I planned... ...it's like I have fulfilled my dad's wish This is madness Dad was not mad, true... ...but what was the need for such strange thoughts? Two years' salary... ...that too, in a day It is enough if I am careful for 2 hours He does not know hunting... ...escaping is not that difficult With that money, we can perform Uma's marriage I dont understand anything - you dont need to understand Hari... -Sir? You leave now... ...I will come after ten minutes Hm Listen... ...if it does not happen in two hours... ...I will fire in the air... ...you come back here Hari... - Hm? Dad...always with a dissatisfied face..., ...and reserved Appanna Shetty is what I remembered But today... ...he looks smiling... ...look... What do I say about Gulabi sister?... ...I have not seen her speaking loud Where is Ganesh? Ganesh brother... Where is Ganesh brother? - he is here only Oh! Be careful madam... - hm Mom, you took bath in the river and came? Mom... ...Mom... Dad, see mom has been sitting like this... ...she is not talking What happened Gulabi? ...too many clothes to wash? Are you tired? Thinking that you would have left, I did not come near the river Dad, is mother talking now? Today I met Vikas... He and Ganesh were taking bath in the river day before yesterday... Seeing cloth floating, mom has got into water... ...meanwhile, Ganesh who had dived elsewhere, got out of water near mom When I told him the way mom is behaving now... ...he said she must be carrying the same fear now Gulabi... ...why are you doing this? Look here... ...look here... Oh, for such small thing, you get scared like children? Gulabi... You had come to the river, I saw you Last time you missed getting 2 years' salary together... ...you would have felt bad then, right? ...you have that chance again There were 2 bullet marks on the tiger's skin, shot by dad... ...but, I fired only one bullet at this tiger He has done hundreds of hunting... ...atleast I have to complete one, right? As it is second time, I feel that I have some experience Tiger needs more power If you escape from my gun shot... ...I will give you 4 years' salary together Hm... I have filled dummy bullets... ...tomorrow morning... Are you still grieving over Gulabi? You need to forget. Time makes you forget everything I will not force you... There is still time to write autobiography We can go at a later date No... ...we will go for hunting tomorrow morning itself You had come to the river, I saw you (Yakshagana in background) Since the demise of Gulabi... ...Uma had not come to Yakshagana As Harsha knew, he was waiting for her to come on her own Harsha brother, Uma sister asked you to come to the usual place Tiger outfit...?! ...why is it here?! The bullet has hit the chest... ...oh, end of it... I had loaded the live bullet ...to go to the same place where my Gulabi has gone... You sit here... ...I will just go and return, please sit down ...to make him keep quiet was a big challenge to me He was talking about the sin of murder and even covering it up Please pardon me... ...at that time I did not have any thought other than dying That day, I did not let him go till he said that he has pardoned me You should never think of suicide again Getting entangled with police, jail would have affected his future spiritual life... He underwent greater punishment than what police or jail would give There was a line in his novel that a murderer has no right to live... ...the previous day he was reading the same novel I knew very well what was running in his mind... ...knowing it, had I kept the rifle in the same status, ...I would have been responsible for his death, that's it You should never think of suicide again I reminded him what he told me From that day he was dull for a week A doubt was bothering me... ...whether he would write about Harsha in his autogiography... ...added to it, the fear of police case and jail also The reason for my going for hunting... ...was to console my mind But... ...to the outside world it would seem as madness If people think that I am fully mad... ...it would mean that I am spoling the dignity of my book myself Tell me who would listen to the preachings of a mad man? So... you... ...you are not writing those in your autobiography? Greetings, Shetty sir... ...you got any idea for your new novel? People like you get ideas in such places, right? Hm... Wait Shetty sir, I need to talk to you People in village talk different things about you... ...but I dont believe any of them... ...I have lot of respect for you You are a big novelist... ...even I have a story... ...can it be made a novel? Will you please listen to my story for ten minutes? A village... ...two orphans... ...one is a youth of age 25 to 26... ...other one is your age The person of your age was feeling strange things now and then... Suddenly, one day... ...he took the gun and left for hunting with an accomplice According to villagers, there is no animal in the place selected by him That another youth... ...that orphan... ...was also wandering in the same place However much he tried, they could not get any animal for hunting At last... ...to satisfy his hunting craze... ...they will fire at the youth wandering there For the craze of big people... ...an innocent life becomes a victim In the end... ...they bury the body there itself... ...and return to town as if nothing has happened... ...and live peacefully How is the story? Why Shetty sir, what happened? How do you know all this? I know. That's it The dead person is my friend I am the only person who knows this If this secret has to remain within me... ...I need your signature Not as your fan wanting the signature on your novel... ...I need your signature on stamp paper that I am the owner of half your property Think about it There is nothing to think... ..I can't sell even an inch of property... Everything is ancestral property... ...without signature of you and your mother the nothing could not be sold You think and decide... ...I will come to your house tomorrow Can't live thinking of good and bad... Doesn't the hungry tiger hunt and eat deer in the forest?... Good or bad, just or unjust, nothing counts there ...same here Hunger here means money... ...anything can be done for money Sir, why did you come here? I had asked you to wait there The dead body is not there... ...tell me what you did? I will take care of all that, come on Hari... ...listen to me... ...bring the body and put it in float Sir, I have already buried it Harsha was not dead, then? -Hm... ...he had died... ...in a way it was his death When he returned home from there, it was very dark... ...no one had seen him Harsha... Harsha... When you have to be at the Yakshagana, why are you here? Harsha... Harsha... Mohan took Harsha to a small hospital known to him Hospital insisted that it is a police case Mohan would not give up They removed the bullet which was just an inch above the heart He was in the hospital for two days To tell you the truth I have not met Harsha since morning... ...I had to talk to him very urgently I thought he would have come here to meet you Did your father come to know about you guys? No Do you have rifle in your house? No... Why? That is... ...asked you to know if your father has the craze for hunting Hunting?... ...hunting? these days?... ...that too my dad!? I dont think he has ever touched the rifle in his life Ok, I will leave now If you meet Harsha, can you ask him to come to this place tomorrow? Hm He understood that I have not done that Other than me, the only person there was Shambu Shetty No one is staying in this house since two years... ...every one is settled in Bangalore... ..they have no plan of returning for now They send a fixed amount to my friend every year to look after the house I convinced him I will take care of the house for half the amount and taken the key Now, the upkeep of this house is mine You have to stay here for few days... ...may be 15 days or a month I want to talk to Shambu Shetty - What is the matter? He wanted to discuss on beetle nut transportation & he had asked me to come I have been doing that... ...is he going to speak himself? Ok... come in The income from beetle nut crop is around 1 to 2 lakhs per month... ...he was donating all the income to orphanage till now... ...he does not have a rupee on hand But, what did you discuss with him? He will give us the monthly income from the beetle nut crop for a year... ...you have to be here for a year Totally it will be 20 to 25 lakhs... ...we will share and stop it there I could not bear this for 15 days... this is not possible... ...think of some thing else You can stay in a different town for a year But your urge to meet Uma... your trying to meet her...and the people seeing you... ...why all that problem? Think about it How did Harsha agree for all this? Poor guy... was in two minds But I have tell all this to Uma No... ...no one should come to know This sort of information spreads fast Moreover, Uma's father works in Shambu Shetty's house, right? If you are not convinced, listen... ...it will be my responsibility to unite you and Uma... After one year you can move around in village as you wish There is no problem even if Shambu Shetty sees you... ..I will take care of that I feel it's difficult to accept your these words You say it is a challenge to live without causing pain to another life... Huh... ...it all depends on how we ourselves groom our lives May be... ... we will understand it at least after reading your autobiography Sir... please come for lunch Hari... Tell me sir From this month onwards... ...you give me the cash proceeds of the beetle nut sales But... for the orphanage? Not for now No one should get any doubt... ...no one will come to this house... ...even then, we have to be very careful Hey, hey, hey... How is Uma now?... ...how does she feel if I am missing all of a sudden?... ... the time spent so far seems like ages... ...Tell me correctly still how many days are left? Eight months Eight... ...hm, 240 days Each day when you get me food... ...I am striking off each one of these marks Why all this? Otherwise I dont understand anything, I feel like I am lost Sister... ...I understand Harsha brother is not in the village! Lord Krishna... why doesn't Lord Krishna come? Tell me dear why doesn't Lord Krishna come? its almost a month since Lord Krishna last came even the food has turned poison do you know dear even the food has turned poison How long one can hide what is in mind... ...at last Uma told me about Harsha He has not told even the Yakshagana group ...I have my own doubt if he will come back I will go mad if I think that my daughter is not married after so long If I go to near the river... ...I get some sort of peace of mind I feel like staying there only Greetings Shetty sir if truth is out you will be punished or put behind bars The money that you are giving me now... ...you can continue it for another year... Harsha... - Hm? What can be done with the money we have? If both of us share, it may be just 10 to 12 lakhs each So what? If you stay here for an year... ...both of us can get double this amount You stay here for a week, you will understand I would have definitely stayed... ...think about it It is possible Harsha I am going out of here day after tomorrow, that's it Dont be scared that Uma will go out of your hands... ...I will take care of uniting you both Dad... - Hm... If you dont agree to get married in the next two months..., ...whatever you think should not happen will certainly happen Why did you bring the food? I would have come with you Harsha... dont persist like children... ...nothing will happen if you tolerate for a year Not possible Hey... Only one year, keep quiet... Harsha.. Hey... Harsha... - I can't, dont force me... Mohana... Mohana... Mohana... Mohana closed the room completely ... To give food... ...he made provision for window from outside that he only could open Hey... hey... Hey Mohana... Hey... hey... Though I knew all this... Four acres... ...it is besides the road... ...good place to put up cashew factory Will you come? Let's see and come Mohana... ..Harsha?... Shhhh... Heard you are looking for alliance for your daughter? Yes, I want to complete that responsibility Has Uma agreed for marriage? I think you know about it... ...she was in love with that Harsha Here... stop here By the way... ...I told her in many ways... ...she did not agree at all I dont know what she thought... ...one day she came and said that she will marry any boy of my choice This is the right time... ...before she could change her mind... ...I will marry her off I am looking for an alliance Thanks for dropping me till here... ...I will take leave of you Is that not Uma?! Whatever the number of years... ...it's my responsibility to unite both of you You can trust me in this matter It's my promise to you I am sure what I am doing is not wrong Even if it is wrong... ...uniting you both will be penance to that I am agreeable... He wanted to talk to you... ...you can talk whatever you want Uma... ...there is a reason for me to take this decision... That is... I will not let both of them getting injustice in this matter They both should unite Meaning... ...you will marry off your wife to him? She is not my wife at all... ...and I will not look at her from that perspective She will be in this house for a year on her own, that's it Harsha will come one day... ...Mohan had in his mind to tell Uma that he will unite you both But, leave alone Uma talking... ...she was not even standing in front of him Sir... ...after completing your autobiography... ...do you have to go from here? ...spirituality or something else... ...can't you live that life here itself? What you say is also right... ...to leave everything and go... ...is not possible for me also It was not difficult to leave the house, property... ...but the title of Novelist... ...the memory of father who died years ago... ...wanting to write my autobiography... ...that has to be read by thousands of people... ...huh I could not leave any of these The great life of spirituality... ...does not seem to befit a selfish person like me Leaving everything... ...it is for people like Buddha and Baahubali The moment they decided... ...they left everything and went I am in no way comparable to them At least for inviting for your brother's wedding you came home! But you did not invite us for your wedding That happened in a hurry Sister in law is very cute... ...when are you giving the sweet news? Akku... ...what do you think about our pair - Uma and me? Not like that... ...I have promised Harsha that I will unite both of them... ...even then... Even then? I dont know what she felt... ...one day she came and said... ...that she will marry any boy of my choice May be Uma had decided to forget Harsha Even otherwise... Having gone missing for two years... ...if he has gone out of her mind also? I need a help from you Means? Meaning... ...do you still have Harsha in your mind? Look, you need not hide things from me... The love affair between you and Harsha... ...and though married, how you are living with Mohan, everything I know What is in your mind now? I did not marry you because I like you If you proceed without heeding to my words, ...I will not do anything to you... ...but I will die That day I was prepared to tell all that... ...but there was no need Brother... I wanted to die when dad forced me for the marriage But without knowing why Harsha cheated me and went missing, I did not feel like dieing But one thing is true... ...I cant imagine any one in place of Harsha But now I am getting another thought... ... knowing my father's pressure for my marriage... ...if your brother came to marry me May be your brother did this to unite me and Harsha, whenever he returns Otherwise tell me what other reason he would have to marry me? If Harsha returns... ...I think that we can be together again He will trust me He trusts your brother also However much I dont want... ...the trust is growing beyond me If you let me out now, I will not take any revenge against you... ...will not even tell the truth to Shambu Shetty... ...I will take Uma and go somewhere far I am just asking you... ...if Uma is married by now? If such a thing has happened... ...I will not spare you, who had promised me and cheated The sleeping beast, woke up today roared wildly, without making a noise neither could win her heart, nor could gain her affection the urge to win both at the same time the thirst for Money and Beauty ... is pulling up the beast The sleeping beast, woke up today roared wildly, without making a noise the creeper didn't wish to embrace the tree it's waiting for another one when one's greed opens up when colourful lusts rejoice The sleeping beast, woke up today roared wildly, without making a noise when the conspiracy came as lightining and thunder... Violence rains heavily to kill the truth and put an end to the story the beast gets ready to kill the innocence The sleeping beast, woke up today roared wildly, without making a noise What did you do to Harsha? Tell me what you did I am ready to die... ...why do you shoot from behind? I will be looking eye to eye... Load the gun... fire the bullet... Hm... But one thing... ...I have to see Uma last time... ...after that you do whatever you want You have done so many mistakes... ...but you have not done something that smears blood on your hands... No Mohana.. ...I definitely do not agree for this Whatever happens, Harsha will not come out If at all he comes out... ...it will be his dead body To get a job done... ...people giving money to politicians or officers, is called bribe I am giving you money not to do a job This is also called bribe Every time you coming to me... ...I pay you money... ..I am feeling disgusted about myself Means... ...you dont want me to come to you? If that is the case... ...give me a big amount once for all After that I will not even come near you Hari... - Hm? You go to Bangalore tomorrow itself... ...give this to our publisher. You stay there for two days... ...they will arrange money and give you, bring it It's a novel written about 6 to 7 years ago ...however much I write... ...I never felt it has reached my literature level So, I had kept it without printing When you did not want to print it... ...but now? Just do what I say I have kept a letter in that and I have written what I want to tell them Take it along Brother... Uma... Uma... People who force without consent... ...are not humans at all... ...they are demons As you wanted cash only, it took one more day After the publication of your novels stopped... ...they said that their business was not good They felt very happy with the new book and giving them all the rights Leave me... leave me Harsha... Harsha, leave me When I know that you will kill me, why should I spare you? Either you have to die or I have to go out. Tell me... ...tell me you are letting me out... ...will you let me out? Tell me...will you let me out? I will not trust you Why should I trust you? It is like this in such a situation... ...if you come out... ...if you come to know something which you are not supposed to?
