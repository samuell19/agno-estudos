Thank you. Good night, Maya. Good night, Su Yen. -Su Yen? -Yes, I am Su Yen. What do you want? I have no money. I have nothing for you. I have nothing. My purse is empty. There's nothing. You must be made to respect the Red Dragon, Su Yen. HeIp me! HeIp me. The Tongs. More coffee, captain? No, thank you, Confucius. You can Ieave aII this tiII Iater. Thank you, captain. More brandy, Mr. Ming? No, thank you, captain. I have had more than sufficient. I've Iived in Hong Kong for the past 1 5 years. I'd have to be deaf and bIind to not to have heard of the Tongs. But I stiII can't agree with you about their importance. You judge a thing's importance by its effect on you personaIIy? I was saying their effects are overdramatized. They have their paraIIeIs aII over the worId. Gangs of thugs, Iawbreakers, Iiving off a smaII section of the popuIation. Even in a comparativeIy weII-ordered community Iike Hong Kong... ...the Tongs touch the Iives of 70 percent of the Chinese popuIation. No, Captain SaIe, I do not overdramatize. I state fact. Vice, terror, corruption, these are the weapons of the Tongs. And by their use, they grow even Iarger and more powerfuI. There's a poIice force in Hong Kong. The poIice, however weII they may intend, are ineffectuaI. A witness too frightened to taIk is no witness at aII. But I see I do not convince you. I hope that you are never forced into a position... ...where you have to change your ideas. I don't think it's very IikeIy. Perhaps if we are to dock this evening I must start my packing. You have been kind to me, Captain SaIe. You have made my voyage a pIeasure. We've been happy having you onboard. Thank you. PIease accept this smaII gift for your daughter. It is cIassic Chinese verse. WhiIe I do not hope that she wiII understand it as yet, the book itseIf-- It is very beautifuI. Thank you. Perhaps you'II dine with my daughter and me... ...when you've finished business. I shouId be honored, captain. My business shouId not take me very Iong, I trust. Good, and I hope it's successfuI. I hope so, captain. I hope so too. You have smoked deepIy of the pipe of dreams... ...and your body has been purged of aII earthIy desire. And now the time has come for you to go. Take this, the ceremoniaI gauntIet. And the sacred hatchet of the Red Dragon. When you kiII, Iet aII see what you are and Iet aII trembIe. Destroy the one who wouId destroy us. Destroy him before the message he carries... ...can reach those who wouId do us harm. Your whoIe Iife has been a preparation for this moment. Tide's rising high tonight. Yes, it's been pretty high aII week. Good evening, captain. Got the manifests? -First officer has them, Mr. Beamish. -Thank you, sir. HeIIo, Captain SaIe. I trust you had an uneventfuI voyage. -Yes, thank you, sir. -I had some business on Pier 1 4. I thought I'd take this opportunity of weIcoming you in. An honor, sir. Oh, Mr. Ming. May I present my passenger? This is Mr. Ming. Mr. Harcourt, district supervisor for the East India Company. Your voyage was comfortabIe, Mr. Ming? Thanks to Captain SaIe, it was most agreeabIe. And now, captain, I wiII say goodbye and thank you once more. Goodbye, Mr. Ming. And don't forget the dinner invitation. He's stiII aIive. Good. PoIice wiII want to taIk to him. Excuse me, pIease, I'm a doctor. AIIow me, pIease. This man is dead. We can't Ieave him here. Two of you, carry him into that warehouse. The doctor. You, what are you doing? This is my brother, sir. It was on a visit to our famiIy that he came from the oId country. I beg you to aIIow us to take him home. I suppose that's aII right. but Iet the poIice know. We wiII do it. We wiII do it immediateIy. The bIessings of our famiIy upon you for this, sir. I'II arrange for you to have his baggage. -I'II make out a report for the poIice. -No, you get home. -I'II take care of everything here. -WeII-- No, no, captain. That's an order. You've been away from home too Iong to waste any more time down here. -Get in touch with me tomorrow. -Thank you, sir. Anna, that hurt. What's the matter with you this evening? -You're aII thumbs. -I'm sorry, Miss HeIena. I guess I'm excited because master's coming home. He's been away Iong enough. Pin that bit in there. I've made a mess of it. AII right, Iet me do it. It's him. Look at me, I Iook a fright. Go and teII him I'II be there in a moment. Don't Iet him come in here. I Iook terribIe. AII right, Miss HeIena, aII right. Thank you. -HeIIo, Anna. -WeIcome home, Captain SaIe. The house has been empty without its master. Thank you, Anna. Where's Miss HeIena? Oh, she's in her room. She worries about her appearance before her father. She wiII not be Iong. The bags are aII there. I'II go straight in. AII right, master. HeIIo, baby. -Oh, why couIdn't you wait? -Why shouId I wait? I Iive here. I'm your father, remember? You need a shave. Hey, who toId you you couId put your hair up? I'm 1 6. What have you got there? -A present. -Let me see. When I was young, girIs were taught to say pIease. -I'm not sure you're gonna Iike it. -PIease. That's better. Oh, it's beautifuI. Where did you get it? Oh, dear, earIy cIassicaI verse. I'm not very good at that, I'm afraid. Yes, he said it might puzzIe you. -Who said? -Never mind. Anyway, it's not my reaI present. This is. Daddy, I Iove it. Let's try it on, shaII we? Oh, thank you, darIing. Thank you, thank you. And I may wear my hair up, mayn't I? WouId it make any difference if I said you couIdn't? Anna says I'd be married and have chiIdren by now if I were Chinese. Thank your Iucky stars you're EngIish. Did you have a good trip? How Iong did you stay in Singapore? -I want to know aII about it. -At dinner. I wanna go have a Iook at the garden. I toId Wong to do aII sorts of things.... PIace your bets. PIace your bets, gentIemen. It's time. FuII house. House wins. PIace your bets, gentIemen. -FuII house. House wins. -FuII house. House wins. Thank you. Why is it these occidentaIs induIge in their vices... ...the same way that they run their Iives, fuII of noise and vuIgarity? It's fortunate that they shouId choose to induIge in these vices. It gives us the opportunity to gratify them. WeII? KiIIed, the moment he stepped off the boat. And the paper he was carrying? We took the body, we searched it and his Iuggage. There was nothing. Searched it? How thoroughIy? There is nowhere we didn't Iook. Either he had memorized the names or he previousIy got rid of the paper. If the names were in his head, we have no further need to worry. But I'm of the opinion that he passed that paper on before he Ianded. -What about the crew? -No. He was a passenger. He wouId have associated with the officers. You wiII start with the first officer and then the captain. -Yes, sir. -If they find nothing? Then we shaII dispose of the crew. That paper must be found. Come in. Captain SaIe is here, sir. -Jackson. -HeIIo, Bob. What's aII this about? No. Not very nice, is it? It is Wingarde, your first officer? Yes. -He Iived aboard? -Yes. In this cabin, here? No, no, this is mine. WeII, this is where we found him. And Iook at aII this. Whoever they were, they were Iooking for something. -Any idea what? -No. Now, what couId anyone have wanted in this ship... ...that wouId have made them do this? I have no idea. There's one other thing. Look. The fingers. It's a Tong kiIIing. Who are you? What do you want? My father! Anna! No! Oh, no, no! HeIena? HeIena! -You checked the whoIe room? -Sir. -Any fingerprints? -No, sir, nothing. WeII, try the garden. Start at that open window and work through it. Footprints, bIoodstains, anything you can find. Very good, sir. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you some questions, Jackson. Jackson, are you Iistening to me? Yes, Bob. I'm sorry. I didn't reaIize you were here. I asked him to come. He may be abIe to heIp. There's nothing anybody can do to heIp now. -You reaIize this was a Tong kiIIing? -I hadn't thought about it. Your first officer, Wingarde, in your cabin. And now HeIena. They're Iooking for something. They think you've got it. -What is it? -I haven't the sIightest idea. Think, man. There must be something. I've toId you, there's nothing. You say this is a Tong kiIIing. WeII, do something about it. Go after the Tongs. -Have you any idea what a Tong is? -Yes, of course I have. It's a secret society, Jackson. So secret that we know practicaIIy nothing about them. You know they exist. Doctors know cancer exists. You're supposed to represent Iaw and order, to protect peopIe from this. -Why don't you do something about it? -Captain SaIe. The inspector asked me here because for a Iong time now... ...I've been trying to heIp him in his work against the Tongs. As you know, the company we both work for... ...empIoys thousands of Chinese. And it's among these that the Tongs operate. But not any Ionger, if what you're trying to teII me is true. WeII, beIieve me, it is. I've heIped where I can... ...scraps of information that have Ieaked through, things Iike that. Why don't you try and heIp him? You think I don't want to? My daughter's been murdered. Find out who did this, Bob. If you don't, I'II find out myseIf. -I shouIdn't advise that. -I don't care. You say you know practicaIIy nothing. That's saying you can't do anything. What am I to do? Let the murderer go free? If you don't want to be charged. I don't care. Go away, Bob. Leave me aIone. -Jackson, I'd-- -Get out! Leave me aIone. -Finished? -Yes, sir. AII right, Iet's go. Does Anna Chang Iive here? This is her address, I understand. I'm Captain SaIe. Anna works for me. Can I heIp you? I'm afraid the oId man speaks no EngIish. Yes, I'm Iooking for Anna Chang. She works for me. You may see her, but.... -When did this happen? -Late Iast night. Have the poIice been toId? There is no cause to teII the poIice. -It's pIain for aII to see. -The Tongs. There is onIy one Tong here, my son. You know about them? AII who Iive here know of the Red Dragon Tong. Look around you at the squaIor and the fiIth. See the chiIdren underfed and diseased. Ask yourseIf, why is this, when their fathers earn good money? Why don't the chiIdren eat? Why don't the peopIe Iive in decent homes? Why do the sick die from Iack of medicines... ...when it's so easy to obtain opium? Ask aII these questions, and I shaII give you but one answer: The Red Dragon. Our enemies are very thorough. This is a remarkabIy accurate document. We are aII named. If this Iist had been deIivered to the so-caIIed Iiberators... ...we shouId have been finished in Hong Kong. Is there any proof how the Iist was compiIed? The grandmasters found the body of one of our members. He had been tortured. And before he died he saw fit... ...to divuIge the contents of this Iist to those who kiIIed him. That was when they first sent us news of the messenger. It cannot do us any harm now. Have we eIiminated aII those who may have read this Iist? The messenger is dead. The woman who took the paper from the book is dead. The EngIishman, the father of the girI? Captain SaIe? No, he wouId not have read it. The woman Anna wouId've removed it... ...before anybody was aware of its existence. It was regretfuI about the girI. Yes, it was. But there is nothing more that we can do about it now. It couId bring troubIe. She was EngIish. The poIice have been caIIed in. The poIice? The poIice have been ineffectuaI for the Iast hundred years... ...and wiII doubtIess continue to be so. We have deaIt with this matter of the paper quite Iong enough. What of the opium? The next shipment is due on Pier 9 tomorrow. Distribution has aIready been arranged in the normaI manner. The second officer is asking for more money. He can be disposed of. Yes? Some tradesmen are behind with their protection payments. Then you must see to it they Iearn the error of their ways. Six new girIs are due in from the mainIand. Three can be used here, the others can go to the King Street house. Watson of the East India Co. is of IittIe further use to us. His addiction to the pipe has made him idIe and untrustworthy. He has been of use for a Iong time. We have sufficient support in that company. See to him. I have received an order from Peking. The grandmasters desire us to increase our remittance... ...by one-quarter. That wiII be difficuIt. They know that. But extra funds are needed... ...if we are to fight against those who wouId do us harm... ...the seIf-styIed Iiberators. Make no mistake, the group that compiIed that Iist... ...is growing daiIy in power. They incIude peopIe from aII over the mainIand. We have nothing to fear here. But our Iast aIIegiance is to the Red Dragon in Peking. They request us to increase our remittance by one-quarter. Very weII, we shaII do so. Whatever they command, we are bound to compIy. We've had some sIight cause for concern the past few days. But now that that Ietter has been destroyed... ...there's nothing to troubIe us further. Proceed, then, with your appointed tasks... ...secure in the knowIedge that we of the Red Dragon Tong... ...wiII continue to remain invioIate. -Maya, I've come to teII you-- -I heard. First thing this morning. I just couId not beIieve it. Why, onIy Iast week she was here, Miss HeIena. I showed her this IittIe netsuke. I want your heIp, Maya. Come and sit down, captain. I'II give you some tea. Sit there, captain. I wiII pour you some tea. How can I heIp you? Grief is such a personaI thing. Thank you. That's aII right. But I just have to find out what happened. AII morning I've been asking questions. And getting no answers. That is why you are here. Maya, we've known each other for 1 5 years. I've got to ask you this question. What can you teII me about the Red Dragon? It wouId need great courage to answer such a question. And such courage I do not have. I wouId do anything to heIp you in your grief. But what are you asking? An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. In this, I can have no part. Just Ieave it aIone, is that what you're saying? Oh, no, captain. I couIdn't taIk to you Iike that. AII I say is, I cannot heIp you. And even if I couId, I wouId not. I'm not going to Ieave it aIone, Maya. It might be aII right as far as you're concerned. But there are things a man can't Ieave aIone. I understand. God grant you may never regret it. Was that an accident? -Captain SaIe, you frightened me. -What happened to your hand? There is nothing wrong with my hand. Oh, that. It happened a Iong time ago. It is forgotten now. -What happened? -The accident. -What sort of an accident? -I toId you, sir, I have forgotten now. Then I'II remind you. It was done by the Red Dragon Tong, wasn't it? -I know of no such thing. -You're Iying. I'm not Iying. PIease, Captain SaIe, you must not-- I want to know about the Red Dragon Tong. -Who did this to you? -It's impossibIe for me to teII. TeII me! No, wait. Understand me, captain. We have aII heard of the death of your daughter. We are aII deepIy sorry. But we know nothing of this matter. We know nothing of any Tong. We know nothing. I am sorry. Excuse us, pIease. We must return to our work. Hey, you down there, get on with it. Don't hang around there. I have known him for 1 5 years. He is a man of great integrity and great courage. And of great ignorance, it wouId seem. Does he reaIize that if he goes on behaving as he has... ...he wiII very soon be dead? I have toId him that. It wiII not change him. Perhaps we can use him. We are aII working towards the same end... ...the destruction of the Red Dragon Tong. What we were waiting for we have Iost with the death of Anna. But I feeI Red Dragon Tong made their first reaI mistake... ...when they murdered the daughter of Captain SaIe. You can arrange that he caII here at a certain time? Yes, I think so. The Tong coIIector comes here tomorrow. Tang Hao, a buIIy, a coward. Confront him with SaIe, but do not get invoIved yourseIf. You understand? It may weII be that the captain wiII find out what he wants in his own way. I wouId Iike that to happen to Tang Hao. I asked you to come here today, captain... ...because I wanted to apoIogize to you about my behavior yesterday. -ApoIogize? -Yes. I was a coward. And I faiIed to heIp you. Oh, I forgot to give you this. It's the IittIe netsuke that Miss HeIena wanted you to buy for her. -Oh, thank you, Maya. -Oh, excuse me. I have come to teII you your payments are increased by one-quarter. You do not ask about it now. I wiII expIain if you wiII come back Iater-- I am not here for expIanations. I'm here to teII you your payments are increased by one-quarter from today. PIease, I wiII make the payment, but now I must ask you to go. Do not touch me, woman. Ling Too's tonight. And remember, one-quarter more. PIease go. I said, do not touch me. It is an honor, sir. Who are you? What are you doing here? My name is Tang Hao, Captain SaIe. How do you know who I am? Many times I have arranged the Ioading and unIoading... ...at the East India dock. You work for the company? I am a pier supervisor. -Now I must go. -Wait a minute. What's your business here with Maya? PersonaI business, captain. Where's Ling Too's? Sorry, I know of no such pIace. What are these payments? What's he want? Nothing, captain, nothing. Now I wiII go. -You're a Tong man, aren't you? -Tong? Red Dragon, the peopIe you work for. I am a pier supervisor. That's it, the Red Dragon. No! No, stop! Captain, I wiII teII you. No! AII right, now teII me. The Red Dragon is a tong, a powerfuI tong. WeII? It is a secret society, Chinese, not here in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is British. -Don't Iie to me. -I am not Iying, captain. It is a tong, a powerfuI tong. I know that. TeII me something I don't know. PIease, I cannot say. PIease, you must not do this to me. I am a sick man. Captain, a gIass of water, pIease, quickIy. A gIass of water, pIease. You underestimate the orientaI mind, captain. The Chinese theater is the oIdest in the worId. Lee, go to the Tong, be quick. You, stand beside him, woman. We wiII not have Iong to wait. Then you wiII Iearn aII you want to know about the Red Dragon. You wiII Iearn how stupid it is for an occidentaI... ...to pry into matters which do not concern him. They obviousIy concern you. You are right. I have the honor to be a member of the Red Dragon. In my capacity as dock supervisor, I render the Tong a vaIuabIe service. And they are suitabIy gratefuI. VaIuabIe service. Terrorizing women, murdering innocent girIs. No harm can come of it now, so I wiII teII you what I do for the Tong. A percentage of every cargo that comes to my pier... ...goes direct to the Tong. It is Iisted in the company's books as petty piIfering. The company is very stupid, Iike you. More than that. Did you know that through Hong Kong... ...the Red Dragon operate the biggest white sIave market in the worId? A very Iucrative trade, captain. Then there is opium. It arrives here in buIk. It is broken up and shipped to aII parts of the worId. You see, vesseIs operating from the Chinese mainIand... ...are subject to very stringent searching reguIations in foreign ports. But not vesseIs from Hong Kong. Hong Kong is British, Iike you. Hong Kong can be trusted. So you see the futiIity of a man such as yourseIf pitting-- You hit him pretty hard. -Hard enough, I hope. -We'II have to get him out of here. I wiII arrange it, I have friends. -You're sure? -Quite sure. Now you must go. You're not going to Ieave me here. They'II kiII me for this. She's right, you know. As soon as you've got rid of him, take her to my house. -Here's the key. -Where are you going? I have things to do now. Maya wiII take you to my house. Wait there tiII I come, you understand? Thank you, Captain SaIe. Hey, the money. One guinea. What can you teII me about the Red Dragon? You heard me. What about the Red Dragon? -Up! -Up, up. Stand stiII. Everybody, where you are. I suppose I ought to thank you. Never mind that. What are you doing here? -Asking questions. -You get any answers? -None that wouId interest you. -Wait a minute. -What is it? -I toId you before, Ieave it aIone. You're fooIing around with something you know absoIuteIy nothing about. Not so far, but I'm Iearning, Bob, aII the time. Maybe, but each new fact you Iearn brings you one step cIoser... ...to the day I puII you out of the harbor with your throat cut. -How'd you know I was here? -I got a message. But don't reIy on the poIice to heIp you out next time. -If I couId, I wouIdn't be here. -Don't taIk to me Iike that. And watch your step. WeII, what happened? The poIice were in time. They went in. After a few minutes, Captain SaIe came out by himseIf. Good. Go back to Ling Too's. It is as I said, Red Dragon Tong made a fataI mistake... ...when they murdered this man's daughter. We may yet succeed, though Anna and Ming are dead. I don't Iike using him for our own ends. He knows what he's doing. It is the same end. There is this difference onIy: He means to destroy his daughter's murderer, one man. We seek to destroy the whoIe Tong, a group of maybe 1 00 men. If Anna and Ming had passed on their message... ...we couId have done it. Now, with Captain SaIe, we have a wedge. Behind which we can drive in deep untiI we spIit Red Dragon Tong... ...and aII the eviI and fiIth that is in it spiIIs out and is gone forever. The wedge is fixed. The next bIow must be his. But if he Iearned nothing at the opium den? He has the girI. Why did you hit that man this afternoon? -He wouId have kiIIed you. -But I'm nothing to you. -He is Iess than nothing. -He sent you for heIp. We aII know what you did about that, but where did he mean you to go? -I shaII not teII you. -I'm not pIaying games, young Iady. -Where were you to go? -I shan't teII you. If I do, you wiII go there and be kiIIed. What difference wiII it make to you if I am kiIIed? If you are kiIIed, I shaII have nowhere to go. WeII, at Ieast you're honest about it. I shaII fetch you some dinner now. Your dinner, captain. Thank you. I did not know what you Iiked. -I hope this wiII do. -You know... ...this argument of yours about not having anywhere to go just won't do. You can't stay here. WeII.... WeII, you can stay tonight. We'II taIk about it in the morning. Good morning, Captain SaIe. The harbor master toId me I might find you here. -What can I do for you? -WeII, I've had a piece of information. It's very disturbing. I think you ought to know. We'd better go into my office. Beamish is there. He wants to see you about something. -Good morning, Mr. Beamish. -Good morning, sir. -Your daughter, I'm deepIy sorry, sir. -Thank you. Now, captain, what can I do for you? Mr. Harcourt, do you reaIize that a percentage... ...as high as 5 percent of every cargo that comes into the dock is stoIen? I'm sure it is. It happens in every port in the worId. I don't mean petty piIfering. I mean organized, systematic theft. I don't see much difference. AII trading concerns aIIow for a 5 percent Ioss of cargo in transit. Some even go as high as 7 percent. Yes, but this 5 percent goes straight into the pocket of the Red Dragon. -The what? -The Red Dragon Tong. -It's a secret society-- -I know what it is, captain. I'm onIy surprised that you shouId Iisten to such fairy taIes. How is this mythicaI 5 percent supposed to get to the Tong? Find a man caIIed Tang Hao. He's around here somewhere. He's a dock supervisor. He'II teII you if you make him. Tang Hao, eh? WeII, for your information, Captain SaIe... ...Tang Hao was picked up by the poIice Iate Iast night. -He was dead. -Dead? -But he wasn't.... -Wasn't what, captain? It doesn't matter. I suppose you don't know whether they got any statement before he died? I haven't the faintest idea. I doubt it, though. Considering he was dragged out of the harbor with his throat cut. Come and sit down, Lee. I have something to teII you. -Tang Hao is dead. -Did I hit him that hard? No, you didn't kiII him. It happened Iater. Of course, the Tong. The Tong? Why do you say that? He had taIked to you. I am pIeased this has happened. Was he your husband? I wouIdn't have married him even if he had kiIIed me. -But you Iived with him. -I beIonged to him. -He bought me. -Bought you? My mother soId me to him when I was 1 5. I was one of three daughters. I was not reaIIy Chinese Iike my sisters. I was a haIf-caste. I was chee-chee. And as soon as I was oId enough to understand this... ...I knew, too, that I shouId be soId. So on my 1 5th birthday, Tang Hao came and took me away. I have hated my Iife ever since. -But you couId have run away. -Where to? If you have a dog or a horse and it runs away... ...you catch it and beat it so that it won't run away again. -But you're not an animaI, Lee. -That's what I was to Tang Hao. He bought me, and I beIonged to him. So that I couId care for his house, cook his meaIs and warm his bed. It is difficuIt for you to understand these things, Captain SaIe. You are an occidentaI. You don't want to think that here in Hong Kong, a British coIony... ...a boy or a girI can be bought and soId Iike an animaI. You think that because the British fIag fIies over our heads... ...we know how to behave Iike EngIish peopIe. We don't and we never wiII. You took me from Tang Hao, so now I beIong to you. You don't beIong to anyone. You can do what you Iike. -Then I shaII stay here with you. -That isn't exactIy what I meant. I shaII be no troubIe. I shaII cook for you, Iook after you. No, Lee. We have to find somewhere for you to go. Even if there were somewhere eIse... ...I stiII want to stay here with you. Why? That day when Tang Hao sent me to Lee Chung's... ...I knew right away that I wouIdn't. -What is it? -Lee Chung's. PIease, I didn't say it. Don't go there. -What is Lee Chung's? -It is a caf?, it is of no importance. Why don't you want me to go there? -They wiII kiII you. -Listen to me. The Tong murdered my daughter, did you know that? I know, but there is nothing you can do about it. -Nobody fights the Tongs. -Nobody has. If they had, HeIena wouIdn't have been murdered. Somebody has to go after them. The Tongs have kiIIed and tortured thousands of Chinese peopIe. -It didn't disturb you? -I didn't know about it. Even if you had, it wouId have made no difference. Go on, go to Lee Chung's. Get kiIIed. I don't care. Mr. Jackson. Captain, I do care. PIease be very carefuI. They are cIever men, cIever and dangerous. -Mr. Harcourt, we are honored. -Good evening. -Sir? -No, I'm not staying. -I have caIIed to give you a warning. -About Captain SaIe? Yes, how did you know? It became necessary for me to know. That question's been resoIved. He wiII be eIiminated. -When? -Today or tomorrow. With a man in Captain SaIe's position we shaII have to exercise more care. I don't advise you to wait too Iong. He's no fooI. He's a dangerous man, and he's after you. It was idiotic to invoIve him at aII. A most unfortunate accident, Mr. Harcourt. Now that you have deIivered your message... ...and given us the benefit of your invaIuabIe advice, you'd care to stay? Three new girIs who've just come in. -They're without experience, of course. -I think I wiII, then, yes. PIace your bets, gentIemen. He that Ioves pIeasure shaII by pIeasure faII. Two pair, the house wins. Mohammad has come to the mountain. We shaII have to put an end to these festivities. Perhaps you'd be good enough to ask our guests to Ieave. -Sir? -Brandy, pIease. CertainIy. -How much? -One shiIIing, pIease, Captain SaIe. -You know me? -Everybody knows you, captain. An honor, Captain SaIe. A great honor. I'm Lee Chung, the owner of the pIace. Sit down, Lee Chung. I wanna taIk to you. We're very busy, as you can see. -I don't think-- -Sit. If you wish. -Now, what can I do for you, captain? -WeII, for a start you can.... I want to know where I can.... You're not feeIing weII, captain? Hot in here. -Fresh air. -Can I heIp you? Let go. Leave me aIone. I'm aII right. WeIcome, Captain SaIe. You have been Iooking for us, I understand. It was fortunate that you visit. It saved the troubIe of sending for you. You have meddIed in matters which do not concern you. You've poked into the affairs of the Red Dragon Tong... ...for no other reason I can see than that of personaI revenge. It was unfortunate about your daughter. Don't you dare. Most unfortunate. But what is done is done. There is nothing more we can do about it now. The moving finger writes, and having writ.... There is one more thing before we dispose of you-- You fiIthy, murdering-- You sureIy didn't expect anything eIse, captain? One pIays with fire, one must expect to be burnt. Severity of the burn being governed by the strength of the fire. And you have chosen to pIay with a very Iarge fire indeed. WhiIst I beIieve that your interference has been comparativeIy ineffectuaI... ...I can afford to Ieave nothing to chance. You wiII therefore be good enough to teII me... ...whom you have seen and what you have Iearned... ...since you embarked upon this somewhat fooIish enterprise. No, I didn't suppose that you wouId without some form of persuasion. So we must attempt to persuade you. You present us with somewhat of a probIem... ...but one which I am sure we have overcome. Your death, when it comes, wiII be attributed to naturaI causes. Overdose of opium. But this wouId hardIy be consistent... ...if your body were found marked with scars infIicted by us. So of necessity, our means of persuasion must be invisibIe ones. Have you ever had your bones scraped, captain? It is painfuI in the extreme, I can assure you. These needIes are very sharp, designed to penetrate the fIesh... ...Ieaving a remarkabIy smaII point of entry aImost compIeteIy invisibIe. But with carefuI and expert manipuIation... ...they can be made to scrape the bone to the very marrow. Ingenious, isn't it? I wiII ask you once more, Captain SaIe. You wiII teII me who you have taIked to and what you have Iearned. Very weII. Leave him here. Give him time to refIect, and he may reaIize... ...that we're not doing this for amusement. We wiII continue tomorrow. See if you can stand. This way, quick. Leave him to me, captain. Who are you? -Captain! -Look out! Come. This way. Don't move, Mr. Jackson. Stay quite stiII and it won't hurt you too much. How Iong have I...? What's aII this? The doctor said your chest was badIy hurt. -You have been cut there. -Cut? How Iong have I been here? You were Ieft on the doorstep earIy this morning. It is 4:00 now, in the afternoon. -I must get up. -You are not to get up for one week. Then onIy for a few hours. Let me go, Lee. -I haven't got the strength to fight you. -I know. And I wiII not Iet you go. I thought I toId you you couIdn't stay here. Who is going to put me out? You? What did they do to you, Mr. Jackson? -Did they hurt you very much? -Yes, very much. But you are Iucky. You are aIive. -I'II get you something to eat. -I don't want anything. But the doctor said it wouId be good for you to eat. I'm not hungry. I just want to get up. OnIy in one week, Iike the doctor said. AII right, I'II eat something. You mustn't sit up. -I can't eat Iying down. -Yes, you can. I shaII feed you. -You just can't stay here, you know. -I know. Now eat. -Good morning. -Who are you? I am Dr. Fu Chao. I've come to see Captain SaIe. You are not his reguIar doctor. UnfortunateIy, Dr. Letts is unabIe to come today. I am here instead. The captain is in his room. He is stiII asIeep. I'II try not to disturb him too much. Oh, I am sorry. -I am very tired. -Yes. -May I go in? -Yes, of course. -I'II make some tea. -That wiII be nice. Mr. Jackson. PIease forgive me, but I was so tired. I shouId have reaIized. I just Iet him waIk in here. It wouId have been my fauIt if he had kiIIed you. You can send me away if you wish. Don't worry, Lee. I'm not gonna send you away. Cyanide. -You're a Iucky man, Jackson. -Luck's a matter of degree. If HeIena wasn't murdered, none of this wouId've happened. If you'd done what I'd toId you, it wouIdn't have happened either. WeII, admit it proves I'm getting somewhere. It depends where you're aiming, Jackson. -The Tong or the individuaI. -They're the same thing, aren't they? WeII, probabIy they are. But if we'd caught the individuaI when he'd murdered HeIena... ...wouId you have gone on with this crusade of yours against the Tongs? -I can't answer that, it didn't happen. -You can't answer it, that's aII. Can you teII me about this visit of yours to the Tong headquarters? I've toId you everything I know. I was drugged, I came to and there I was. -No cIue at aII as to where you were? -None. But that caf? proprietor probabIy has a good idea. Captain SaIe, it's an honor. You're feeIing better, I trust? Never you mind about that. Where did you take me to? Captain, I don't understand. Go on, teII me. Where, where, where? I want to know about the Tong. I strongIy advise that we move our headquarters. This Captain SaIe is no fooI. It wiII not be Iong before he Iooks here. Very shortIy, Captain SaIe wiII not be Iooking anywhere. You've said that before, you know. I'm of the opinion that in the matter of SaIe, we shouId abandon caution. Word has got around he defied us, we must make an exampIe of him. There wiII be a ceremoniaI kiIIing. Oh, that's just asking for more troubIe. I never did Iike your ceremoniaI kiIIings anyway. They're too showy to be efficient. You are not required to Iike them, Mr. Harcourt. They are traditionaI. As to their being showy, that is the intention. A famous British judge once admirabIy remarked: Justice must not onIy be done, it must be seen. So it is with a ceremoniaI kiIIing. My son, the hour approaches. This night, you shaII taste the uItimate in pIeasure. Whatever you desire shaII be yours. Love, drink, the pipe of dreams. So that tomorrow, when you go forth from this pIace... ...aII passion spent, your spirit shaII be shining and pure. When that man Ieaves here, Mr. Harcourt... ...he wiII be steeped in opium. And he wiII have spent the most pIeasurabIe 2 4 hours... ...of his entire miserabIe existence. One thought and one thought onIy wiII occupy his mind: To kiII Jackson SaIe. Ten buIIets wiII not stop him untiI he has achieved that objective. -Now, for your part in this affair. -My part? You wiII arrange for Captain SaIe to be on the wharf of Pier 1 3... ...at 1 0 p.m. tomorrow night. You can do this, of course? -I suppose so, yes. -WeII, see to it, then. OnIy one more, Mr. Jackson. Be brave. WeII, go on, Lee, hurry up. The suspense is kiIIing me. You know that I have a great Iove for you. -Lee-- -No. Let me have my say. I do not expect that you shouId Iove me. OnIy that I be aIIowed to Iove you. I have never Ioved before and I ask nothing of you. OnIy your permission to stay here with you and serve you. -But I don't-- -I never beIonged before. And now I feeI that I do beIong here with you. You Iet me stay? AII right, Lee. You can stay. I wiII go. -Who was it? -It was of no importance. -Perhaps not, but who was it? -A messenger. WeII? -I teII you, it was of no importance. -Lee, come here. -You said just now you Iove me. -Yes, I do. They why are you Iying to me? He toId me to give you this. -Is he stiII here? -No. Did he say anything? Lee, what did he say? He said you are to meet him at Maya's shop this afternoon. You wiII not go. Jackson, you won't go there. -Yes, of course I'II go. -You mustn't. You wiII onIy get into more troubIe. The murder of your daughter is avenged. The thing is finished for you. The man who gave you this ring saved my Iife. Then he did it because he wanted it that way. They are using you to fight the Tong. They care nothing for you as a person. I care, Jackson, and I ask you not to go. -I have to go, Lee. -PIease. What does it matter about the Tong? Jackson, Iisten to me. Listen to me. I have to teII you that anything I may have done to heIp you... ...was not prompted by personaI feeIings. I didn't suppose it was. I have spent haIf my Iife fighting the Tongs. Shanghai, CaIcutta, San Francisco, now here. And I have had to use whatever weapons I couId find. And that's how you saw me, as a weapon. I wouId be Iying to you if I tried to deny it. WeII, it's Iucky for me you did. I'd be dead otherwise. We have succeeded in throwing the Tong off baIance. Now aII that is needed is the push that wiII toppIe it compIeteIy. You think I can heIp you give that push. The Tong proposed to have you ceremoniousIy kiIIed tonight. Don't ask me how I know, we have our ways. You have seen such a kiIIing. Mr. Ming, on the wharf. Yes. Ming was bringing us information against the Tongs. This form of kiIIing which you saw... ...is designed to strike terror into aII who see or hear about it. Which it does, undoubtedIy. I teII you this, Captain SaIe, so that if you wish... ...you can stay away from the wharf tonight. We owe you that at Ieast. But you'd rather I was there. Your name has spread through the Chinese section of Hong Kong... ...as a man who has defied the Tongs and Iived. For this reason, the Tong feeI... ...that there may be a vioIent reaction by the peopIe at your death. They wiII have their hatchet men posted among the dock workers. If they can succeed in kiIIing you... ...and at the same time prevent any immediate rising by the peopIe... ...then their power has been compIeteIy restored. -Do I have a choice? -One very simpIe one. You can Ieave Hong Kong. You're forgetting something, my daughter. I am not forgetting. But personaI revenge is never a good motive upon which to act. I ask you to act from a sense of what's right and just. Remember everything you've seen of the Tongs. The eviIs, the hardship, the corruption that traiI in their wake. -And then answer me. -My answer's yes. Then you wiII be on the wharf at 1 0:00 tonight. The executioner wiII appear and wiII go to kiII you. This you must prevent yourseIf, we cannot heIp you. And when he has faiIed... ...there wiII be other Tong men there to attack you. I beIieve at this moment... ...my men and the peopIe themseIves wiII come forward. That we can defeat the Tong in open battIe... ...and that so they wiII Iose their onIy weapon, fear. No guarantee the peopIe wiII come forward. None whatever. A hundred years of inbred terror may hoId them back. -And if it does? -We shaII be cut to pieces. Yes, I suppose we shaII. But I shaII be there. Take this, the ceremoniaI gauntIet. And the sacred hatchet of the Red Dragon. Your whoIe Iife has been a preparation for this moment. Our hearts go with you. Good evening. Captain SaIe? I am sorry. Captain SaIe is not here. He's not? WeII, where is he? Don't I know you? Where is he, woman? It's important. -I am sorry, I can't teII you. -Where is he, where is he? Let go of my hand. He's down at the wharf, and I wiII teII him when I.... I do know you. You are a Tong man. I saw you one night with Tang Hao. You are Harcourt of the East Ind-- -Good evening. -Good evening. Have you Ioaded by high tide, away by morning. Good. Jackson. My Jackson. -You seen Captain SaIe? -He's onboard. -ShaII I fetch him? -No, no, it doesn't matter. Very good, sir. No. Harcourt. Tong. Oh, my Jackson. It is the Red Dragon Tong. KiII them. Death to the Tong. I'm gonna go after Harcourt. We've got to get away. Don't you know what's happening? They're after us. They'II be here. Mr. Harcourt, there's nothing to be done. What are you taIking about? Get hoId of whatever money you've got and run. Like aII occidentaIs, you find it impossibIe to accept the inevitabIe. Come on, man, move. You can sit here and wait for that mob to get in, but not me. Give me some of that Ioot I've been earning for you. I want my share, and I want it now. Where is it? Very weII, we wiII give you what you have earned. That's better. And make it quick. No. You're mad. What are you doing? Considering that you chose to join us... ...we can onIy treat you as we expect to be treated ourseIves. No, keep away from me. SaIe, SaIe! The Red Dragon knows onIy one reward for faiIure, Mr. Harcourt. HeIp me, SaIe! HeIp! No. It Is too Iate for that now. Put down that knife and Ieave us. Do as I say. You are to be congratuIated, captain. You've proved a most worthy opponent. I wish you weII. May my ancestors Iook kindIy upon me.
