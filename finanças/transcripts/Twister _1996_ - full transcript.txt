...by radar now. They did,... the center of the circle in northeast of Kingfisher County, moving northeast. Also, I do want to say to you folks back to the west. A little bit earlier as Bill made... The tornado warning continues now. And they extended officially... I gave this to you a little bit... They extended over to Oklahoma Coun... to...um... Let's call it... They're calling all of Oklahoma County. But right now, mainly it looks like... Jo! Common. What is it, Mommy? Come on, sweetie. Let's get up. Come on. It's O.K. honey. - Mama's got you. - We need to get down to the storm cellar right now! Come on! Take Jo! Let's go! - Come on, sweetie. - Mommy! - Common, hurry! - Don't be scared, Jo. Mama's got you. Mama's got you. TV says it's big. Might be an F-5. We're going to the storm cellar. Toby! Toby! Toby! Toby! Toby! Come on, we gotta move! Hand her to me! Toby! Come on, let's move! Toby! If you have no cellar or basement, go to the center part of your house. We're almost there! Almost there! - Take her... - I got her. I gotta get the door! Toby! - Come on! - Get in Jo! - Hurry! It's coming. - Toby! - Hurry! - Toby! Daddy, Daddy, Toby's still outside! Come on, Toby! Come on, boy! It's O.K., Toby. Grab Jo, honey! Daddy! Take Jo. Aah! I can't! I can't hold it! Dear God! I can't hold it anymore! Oh, God! I can't hold it down! Aah! - Aah! - No! - No! - Daddy! No, Jo! Daddy! Daddy! Stay with me, Jo! Jo, stay with me! My daddy! My daddy! Jo! At 7 a.m. in Oklahoma City, the temperature is 75 degrees. Across the state, skies are partly cloudy. Dry line is mostly in western Oklahoma. Visible satellite pictures indicate thunderstorms developing along and ahead of the dry line. Temperatures over the state were in the mid-70s to low 80s. Chris, take a look. The caps are already starting to break. All the models are forecasting lifted indices from minus 6 to minus 10. You know, if these cells keep building like this, there could be a record outbreak of tornadoes. This's gonna be a long day. Honey...Honey, are you sure she's going to be there? If I know Jo, she's already dragged her entire department into the field. Aw, hell. Day like today, it's to be expected. She forgets everything except her work. You're nervous about seeing her, aren't you? Nervous? No. Why, do I look nervous? No. Well, yeah, you do a little, you know. I just want to get it over with. But she said she'd sign the papers, right? That's what she said. You don't think so? No, I think so. Give me a kiss. O.K., Professor, hang on there! I think I fixed it! I got it Ow! Fuck! This thing is useless! Sorry, Jo. Wait, wait, wait, Beltzer, that's good! Give me a reading! O.K., boss lady. Hold your horses. Which way do you want it, Jo? Looks like the dry line has stalled.

The focus mount's jammed. Where's the focus mount? There's grass in the autofocus. Did you check this? You have to check it. You want me to clean that out'?

The suck zone. It's the point... basically, at which the twister... sucks you up. That's not the technical term for it obviously, but... Hi! I'm Jo Harding. Oh, hello. Nice to meet you. Bill just told me the happy news. Which? Us. Marriage. Jo, Melissa. It's happy news. I...I guess it probably seems kind of sudden. Seems sudden? Dude, you taking the vows? That's sweet. Well, we--we just wanted to get it done before Billy started his new job. That's right. That's right. Right, right, right, weatherman. What? What? Say it. I said weatherman. I think it's great. You had that tone. There was no tone. If you have a problem being a weatherman-- I don't have a problem being a weatherman. Excuse me. Dr. Melissa Reeves here. - I just wanted to say hello. - Hello. - Very nice to meet you. - You too. Billy. What? No. Uh-huh. New truck? That's right. Boy, oh, boy... New job, new truck, new wife. It's like a whole new you. Jo. This is very awkward. I know. Tell me about it. I...I thought you'd be coming out here alone. I wasn't expecting on coming out here at all. - You said you'd meet me... - It's about Dorothy. Dorothy? What about her? She's here. Show me. I can't believe you did it. We built four of them. Does she work? Thought you'd want to be here for her first time out. It wouldn't be right if you weren't here. Whoo-hoo! This is gonna be good. How sweet is that? Bill's concept, man. Wooh! The Extreme, man. It came from his brain. I had a hand in it. Wow, it is great. What is it? It's an instrument pack for studying tornadoes. The first one in history. It's very exciting. Scientists have been studying tornadoes forever, but still nobody knows how a tornado works. We've no idea what is going on inside because nobody's ever been able to take scientific measurements from inside the funnel. That's what she's going to do. How? We put her up inside a tornado. She opens... and releases hundreds of these sensors that measure all parts of the tornado simultaneously. You see, Melissa, it's like this. These sensors go up the funnel and radio back information about the internal structure, wind velocities, flow, asymmetries. We can learn more in 30 seconds than they have in the past 30 years, get a profile of a tornado for the first time. And what will that do? If we knew how a tornado really worked, we could design an advance warning system. Aren't there already tornado warnings? - Well, there are several... - They're not good enough. They're nowhere near good enough. Right now, it's three minutes. If we can get this new information, we can increase warning time to 15 minutes. Give people a chance to get to safety. At least, that's what these guys are trying to do. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's over! - That's right! Oh, yeah! I can't believe you actually did it. Well, we did it. All right. How do you get it in the tornado? Well, you got to get in front of the tornado and put it in the damage path and then get out again before it picks you up, too. It's the suck zone. Oh. Excellent! Jo, we got major action! NSSL says the cap is breaking. Tower's going up 30 miles up the dry line. All right. Let's go. All right. We're moving! It's fatty time. Joey, the laptop. Rabbit, you're up. Come on, let's go away. Let's go! Joey, Haynes, a little help. Yes, sir. Right behind you. Smooth. Where it's at? There it is! Come on, Dusty! You're always last to go! Come on. All right, Beltzer. Preacher, follow! Brian, don't forget the camera. I got it! I got it! They can handle it. They know what they're doing. This is what they do. They... - They live for this. - Uh-huh. Dorothy II and III ready. Dorothy IV ready! Are you sure you don't want to go along? No. Go with them, you mean? Yeah. No, no, they'll be fine. Did she sign the papers? Oh, shit! She didn't? Come on. If we hurry, we can still catch 'em! Hey, Bill, glad you're back! I'm not back! Rabbit. Yeah, boss? Can we do better than the 30? No. Not for a while. It's best to stay on it until we pass Roger's Creek. Copy that. Once we catch up with her, you take the truck and head home. I'll get the papers signed and see you tonight, O.K.? No! You know what, honey? I find this kind of interesting. I'm going to tag along. Jonas. Son of a bitch. Who is that, honey? Jonas Miller. He's a night crawler. We all started out in the same lab, but Jonas went and got himself some corporate sponsors. He's in it for the money, not the science. He's got a lot of high-tech gadgets, but he's got no instincts. And he doesn't have Dorothy. Jo, I think we got fleas. Jo, come back. Hey there. You change your mind? Yeah, what's Jonas doing here? I'm not sure. But I bet, he's asking himself the same question about you. Oh, shit, hold on! Damn son of a bitch! Hey- How long do you think it'll take you to fix it? Oh, maybe 10 minutes. 15 tops. Sounds good. What drives me is the unknown. What if we could predict the tornado's path? How many lives would be spared with the creation of an early warning system? And D.O.T. 3 is the answer-- the first Digital Orthographic Telemeter. And inside, she holds hundreds of these little sensors, which, when released in the tornado, will transmit back data on windspeed, pressure, and dew-point temperature. - Bill. - Why didn't you tell me'? Bill, don't! And what will soon be the center of all studies. Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! You son of a bitch! What'd you think-- I wasn't going to find out about this? Get this loser off me! Back off! Back off! What's your malfunction, man? It's not worth it! What's the matter with you? You stole my design, you son of a bitch! Calm down. What the hell are you talking about? Dorothy. You took her, you damn thief. Oh, I get it. You want to take credit for my design. You're a liar. She was our idea, and you know it. Unrealized idea. Unrealized. That ain't worth shit! - Bill! - Hey, hey! Guys, guys! All my guys, get a grip on yourself. We both know he'll never get that thing up in the air. - That's right. - Well, let me enlighten you people. This baby has satellite comlink. We got on-board pulse Doppler. We got NEXRAD real time. Today we're going to make history. So stick around... 'cause the days of sniffing the dirt are over. Better than what you sniff. We'll see who gets there first, pal. Oh, and by the way, I really enjoy your weather reports. You slime! - I'm not through with you yet! - Come on! Come here! Come on! Come on! Get your hands off of me! - Come on. - Come on, do it. - I'm all right! - O.K.! He's a corporate kiss-butt, man. I'm sorry. I should have told you. One day. I'll give you one day. Whether she flies or not, I'm gone. Honey, honey, is everything O.K.? It's O.K. Everything's fine. Are you sure? - Yeah, yeah. Everything's O.K. - O.K. Listen, I'm going to hang out here and get some air. Why don't you... Why don't you go get us some cold drinks? O.K., sweetheart. O.K. You know, Jo, I don't know what the matter is with Bill. I mean, he... He's... He's wacko. He's crazy. You ought to keep a leash on him. He's not my problem. That means, it's yours. Oh, by the way. This storm's going to be a lot bigger than we anticipated. I got reports of mesos from Grand County all the way to Logan. Sharing information with me'? No. I was just, uh... curious as to which way you're going to head. Southeast, I think... to the counter. Two lemonades to go, please. Nothing changes. Pardon me'? He's going to wait and see what Bill does. - Can I have a coffee to go, please? - Sure. That man is waiting for Billy? Why? So you're telling me that Billy knows what a storm is thinking? Something like that. Gum? My Aunt Meggy used to call him a human barometer. Well, he hasn't really told me about all this. If you have to pee, you should do it now, 'cause there's not very many places to stop once we get on the road. You're still in love with him, aren't you? Check, please. Not that I blame you. I just hope this isn't some desperate attempt to keep him in your life. We're together. Hey, man... what's up? Goin' green. Greenage. Saddle 'em up. You got it, boss. Charles, I need a sector scan on that cell. Keep looking for a hook. Will do, sir. Flanders, what are my dew points doing? Points up to 70, sir. - Honey, I got you a lemonade-- - We got to move out. Listen, follow us n the truck. Stay behind Dusty's van. You'll be safe back there. I got to go with Jo. O.K., let's move out, people! Let's go! Where are we going? Thanks. I'll drive. All right, people. Let's pack it up. Let's go. Ha ha! It's the wonder of nature, baby! Ha ha! Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Hey, you guys! Whoo-hoo! Dr. Melissa Reeves here. Oh. Oh. Oh, hello, Donald.

Oh. Yours? Christ! You couldn't resist, could you? What? I'm not saying you need therapy. - What? - I'm not. - Wait, wait, wait. I need therapy? - I didn't... say that. I need a therapist? What could I possibly need a therapist for? - I don't know. - You're the doctor. Tell me. I don't know... uh... - An inability to finish things. - I don't finish things? Rushing into things you can't quite commit to. Commitment? - You asked me. - Look. - You asked me. - No, that is bullshit. Look, I may have walked out, but at least I showed up in the first place. - You never had the slightest idea... - There's a whole... - road thing going on out there. - You never had the slightest idea about commitment. or being married means, like...like stabilities, supportiveness, the house, and all kinds of neat stuff like that. - Can I drive? - No! Then would you? Whoa! Damn. Wew. Somebody should warn her about your temper. - Jo, I swear if you don't... - Obviously, she has no idea... - what she's getting herself into if you don't. - Stay the hell out of this. I know exactly what I'm doing. - What exactly are you doing. - What am I doing? I think they're getting better at this. You know what? As long as you're happy... Thank you. I am happy. I'm a happy person. I'm happy with my life. I'm happy with the way things are going in my life. I'm happy with...with...with... - with, with, with... - Melissa. I know her name. - Yes, I'm happy with Melissa. - You look happy. I am, Shit! Shit! Hey, are you guys gonna wrap this up pretty soon? What? Oh, nothing. I was just wondering if we're gonna... chase this tornado, or you just want to catch the next one. Shit! Beltzer, is it on the ground? I got it! Easy, easy, easy. We have to bear right. It's on an easterly course. The national weather service has issued a tornado warning, effective until 11 a.m.. For north-- and western... Uh, Dr. Miller. Yes? I think they turned left here. Do it. We're moving to intercept, guys. Get ready to set up. You got it. - You've got to get further ahead of it. - I know what I'm doing. Cut across the field, Bill. I know I have to get ahead of it. You're going to have to get into that field. - Do you want to drive? - I'm just saying-- - Would you like to drive? - Yes, I'd love to. Listen, it's about 3 miles southeast. Let's see what she does. - Go in there! Go in there! - Just wait. - You're going to miss it. - Hold on, hold on. Just hold on a second. Have you lost your nerve? Tighten your seat belt. Bill, Jo, where are you? We lost visual. Are we having fun yet? We got to get out of this. Really? 2 miles now. Picking up speed. Bill, sometime this week would be good. I'm trying to get it out. - Are you mad? - I'll be mad later. Right now I'm trying not to kill us. Funnel getting thicker. It's moving fast. Corning towards you, Jo. It's starting to turn. - Where? I can't see. - You will. Jo, you're too close! It's not going to work! Get out of there! Oh, shit! I can't get out. It's too steep. This was a great idea. See? That wasn't so bad. Let's get her out! Let's go! Why can't we spend a normal day together? We're right in the damage path! You know, this is crazy! Let me go! There's no time! - We got to have... There's no time. - We can still do this! Come on! Come on! Find something to grab ahold of! I know! What are you doing? - Jo, what are you doing. Come back. - I want to see it! - I want to see it! - What you're doing? Come back. Bill! Look out! Look out! Oh, my God. It's gone. It's gone. Where's my truck? Aah! - There it is. - Melissa? Oh, God! Are you O.K.? - Melissa! - Billy! - So, after what? - Billy! - Are you O.K.? - Billy! Oh, God! You--You just missed that truck! That's awesome! That's awesome! Melissa! Oh, Billy! Billy! Are you O.K.? Oh, God. I'm O.K. - Are you sure? - Bill. Bill, she just missed the truck. God, what happened to you? Nothing, honey. We're O.K. We were perfectly safe. Fatty strikes. - Gone. - Whoa, wait a minute. - All trashed. - Oh, my... No, wait. Just hang on. We'll take a look at it. I know it. It's over. It's over. It's all over. O.K. - No fucking way. - Are you O.K.? She's O.K. - Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. - Yeah, dude. Well, there's some good news. It did fly. What was it like? It was windy. Windy. That's intense. All right, move it, Dusty. That's intense. This is intense. Hey, the auto club's here. Maybe we should stop, see if they need some help. Tornado warnings through central Oklahoma... They're fine. Pay attention to the road. Hey, you fashionably late again, Jonas? Fashionably late, heh? Give me a kiss, baby. Get out of here! Get out of here! Loser! Why don't you go find your own twister, buddy? - Loser! Loser! - Yeah, you guys have a nice day, too. Let's go. Don't worry. I'll get them clean. Come on, guys. let's get Dorothy ll ready. Have you got full coverage on that truck? Liability only. Liability only. It's a very pretty truck. - Thank you. - Uh, ha, ha, ha. Don't even think about it. No way. This is the caboose. This is the caboose. I'm waiting for orders, boss. Go ahead. It's your truck. You really should. Dusty, the battle zone should be northeast of 81. Wait a minute. The battle zone Billy? What are we doing? We're going again. Again? But back there you almost got yourself killed. No, no. Just a close call. You're going to cross 15 at Oklahoma 412. 412. O.K., copy that. Haynes, what's on the mesonet? Winds are continuing to back. VILs are at, uh...60. O.K., guys. Let's go get it. Mobile lab. Yeah, Tony, is it me, or has the main updraft shifted? Upper level winds are veering, sir. Uh-huh. This thing might dissipate. We have enough time to get in front of it? Murphy, rotation is increasing. Shear is 90 knots-- 50 outbound, 40 inbound. Yeah, yeah, we see it. We do. We see a very pronounced hook. Checking for you now, sir. Dr. Miller, good southeast gusts at 40 miles per hour, approaching 150 in the funnel. Storm motion is 225 degrees straight out of the southwest. We're in perfect position. Let's proceed. Oh, howdy. Got to admire their spirit. There's your pal. What are you doing? What are you doing? Look at the updraft, the angle. It's going to shift its track. Are you sure? Oh, yes. Definitely a sidewinder. It's gonna move left. - Is that bad? - Wasn't there a road back there? You're right. Go. go. go. go. go! Hello. Donald, now's not a very good time for me, O.K.'? Look, uh, all right. Put Julia on. O.K. Looking good. Looking very good. All right, about 4 miles up, hang a right. Let's deploy, and we'll be done. Uh, Dr. Miller. Shit, shit! It's moving away! Looks like they're going to intercept. Damn it, Tony! I thought you told me this thing was going to stay on the same heading! Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah. oh. We're close. Yeah, I know. O.K. Rabbit, tell me what road we're on. Where does this take us? I know it feels unnatural, but with Donald's motility, you're not going to have this baby the old-fashioned way, even if you stand on your head. She's a reproductive therapist. Laurence. Laurence, come in. We got to get ahead of this storm. What's on the satellite? I can't talk to you right now. I have to call you back. Shifting due south, shifting due south. We have an F-2, ladies and gentlemen, possibly F-3, O.K.'? Read me'? There's very, very large rope on the ground. Very large. - Right on the ground. - It looks like it's turning. It looks like it's turning. The atmosphere is very unstable. I repeat--unstable. This is Rabbit. This is Rabbit. It's at 2:00. It's heading this way. This is Sanders. This is Sanders. We are driving due east on a country road. We've been on it for about 6 miles. We've got an F-3, too, sitting on the ground, - and she's a beauty. - Whoo-hoo! Jo, it's barn burner. Barn burner. It's not going to hang out long. It's not hanging out long. We got it! We got it! We see it! We're getting slammed in here, guys. You better hang back. - This thing loaded? - Yeah. Go for it. Rain bands. What? Look at the surf coming off those fields. Shit. Horizontal rain. Hang on. Jesus, Bill. I've never seen it clouded like this. I don't think anybody has. Bill, we're in the core. O.K., we got sisters. Oh, my God. What? Yes? Julia, I can't talk to you right now. We're right under the flanking line. I realize that. We can't attack this thing from the south. We're going to get rolled. Watch me. Julia, I know you're upset. You...You just got to breathe. The both of us just got to breathe. Cow. I got to go, Julia. We got cows. Another cow. Actually, I think that was the same one. Damn it! We've got drunkards here. We got no path. This is not good. Get us out of here. - I'm trying, okay? - Floor it. Hang on! Whoo! Whoo-hoo! God, did you see that? It was incredible. Oh, honey. Honey. Did you see that? It's all right. Oh, God. It's O.K. It's OK. No, I'm not O.K. This is not O.K. O.K.? Oh, Christ. I'm sorry. Honey, I didn't think. You know, when you used to tell me that you chased tornadoes, deep down I always just thought it was a metaphor. Shh... It's O.K. It's O.K. Three times a lady! Did you see the inflow jets on those fatties? Did you see? I was sitting in the middle of it. I was thinking it might not be too bad of an idea 'cause... if we just got the hell out of here 'cause there were too many tornadoes back there. Are you kidding? This thing's not over. We've only seen the start of it. Hey, you know what? Um... Jo, some of us couldn't help but notice how close we are to Wakita. No. Yeah, Aunt Meg wouldn't mind a pit stop, right? No. Red meat. We crave sustenance. Guys, we are not invading my aunt. Food. - Food. - Food! - Food! - Hey! We are absolutely not going. If there's the spot. Just do it. O.K. Great. Billy! Meg! Come on, honey. Hey, Meg. How are you? - How are you? - Oh, it is so good to see you. - Good to see you. - Day before yesterday I was telling Jo how much I miss you. You haven't seen any of my new work. Jo, oh, honey. Looks like you've seen some action. You should have seen it. - Meg. - Boys! Give me some of that lovin'. Steak and eggs! Steak and eggs! No. In a severe lightning storm, you want to grab your ankles and stick your butt in the air. He's right. If you're going to get hit, it's the safest orifice. Yeah, I'd like to get hit by lightning once. You know, see what it's like. Hey, this is real lemonade. Hey, Meg, I'm moving in here. You guys, look out. Make a space. Look out, look out, Look out. God, Meg. You got a lot of beef. Where did you get all this beef? Did you see my cows out front? - No. - Oh. Oh. Oh! Cool. You slaughter your own cows, Meg. Nice. Potatoes. Better grab some while you can. Meg's gravy is famous. It's practically a food group. Shower's free. I'm next. Oops. Oh, I want that. How can you watch this garbage? Oh, pardon me, gentlemen. You guys got to see this. Careful, buddy. He'll steal your microphone. Well, for me, It's the thrill of the hunt. You know, man against nature, doing battle with the elements. Well, as a scientist, can you actually predict tornadoes now? Well, no. they are very, very unpredictable, as some of my more unfortunate colleagues found out earlier on today. - Turn him off. - But we hope to change all that with a system that I have devised. - God, he sucks. - No. Shut up! - Boo! - Turn him off! - What a wiener. - Agreed. He really is in love with himself. I thought it was just a summer thing. Dude, he's going to rue the day. He's going to rue the day he came up against The Extreme, baby. - Yeah. - Amen, there. Bill, I'm talking imminent rueage. Imminent rueage. I was just wondering, why... why do you call Billy "The Extreme"? Because Billy... is the extreme. Bill is the most out-of-control son of a bitch in the game. No, I think I came in second. I've seen "The Extreme" in high gear. You guys got to get some new stories. I'm gonna go clean up. So, we get this one near Daleton, right? Oh, God. We're way too close, and Jo's got the vid on it, and she's filming it, right? Then all of the sudden out of nowhere, this shitty-looking green Valiant comes pulling up right in the way. She starts... She starts yelling, and this loser stumbles out of the car. He's got a bottle of Jack Daniels in his hand. He's naked. He is butt naked. Naked. Not naked. I was not naked. He was without apparel. Half naked. Naked. So, Jo's yelling at him to get out of the way, right? He just... He strolls up to the twister, and he says, "Have a drink." And he chucks the bottle into the twister, and it never hits the ground. Twister caught it and sucked it right up. Honey, this is a tissue of lies. See, there was another Bill, an evil Bill, and I killed him. I love him! No, that was a good-size twister. What was that, an F-3? Solid F-2. See, now you've lost me again. It's the Fujita scale. It measures the intensity of a tornado - by how much it eats. - Eats? Destroys. The little encounter we had back there was a strong F-2, F-3 maybe. Maybe we'll see some F-4s today. That would be sweet. 4 is good. 4 will relocate your house fairly efficiently. Is there an F-5? What would that be like? The finger of God. None of you have ever seen an F-5? Just one of us. Forget it. Doesn't matter what you do. You'll still be beautiful. You're biased. Yes, I am. Sounds like old times down there. Yes, it does. He didn't keep his part of the bargain. Which part? To spend his life pining for you and die miserable and alone. Is that so much to ask? I don't know. Bill always went his own way, which was usually the same way you were going. Seems like a long time ago. Not so long, Jo. He's here, isn't he? That is so beautiful. We have a serious weather situation... We got one, baby! -Oh, F-3! - Mile outside of Parlaine! This is for Garfield County including the city of Enid. This is a storm that has developed within the last 15 minutes. First-alert Doppler radar shows that this is a very intense storm. You ride along with Dusty, O.K.? Is that cool? - What's the word from SELS? - The word is big. All right, let's go, people! We know where Jonas is? Yeah, he's still in Milston. More than 30 miles from it. - Thanks Meg. - As we're moving, can we beat him? I'm working on it. Thanks for stopping by. I'm sorry to eat and run. It's what you live for. Bye. Good to see you, Bill. Honey, I...I... It's O.K. It's O.K. Tasty cow, Aunt Meg. It's for you, Dusty. Thank you, sweetheart. You and me, right'? - Yes. - Sweet. Sweet. Well, I...it was a pleasure meeting you. Likewise. You better run. Keys. Please. You're welcome. Rabbit. Hang on. Let's go right through Wakita. We'll take Meyers Road right past the fire station. We'll take... um... 132 to 44 East. Rabbit, you know any shortcuts, let us know. We need every second. O.K., Rabbit. Time to impress me. O.K. About a mile up, there's a little detour. We're going to take a walk in the woods. It gets bumpy here, folks. O.K., let's get you wired. Uh, excuse me. O.K., you're up. Whoo-hoo! See, kids? An ordinary person spends his life avoiding tense situations. Repo Man spends his life getting into tense situations, Beltzer! Whoo! O.K., Rabbit. What have you got? O.K., Bill, turn left here toward that farm. You sure about that? Uh...yeah. Trust me. Rabbit is good. Rabbit is wise. - Mother of God. - Jesus Christ. This is a field, Rabbit. I know. Keep going, beyond it, right through that brush. You see that brush right in front of you? Yeah, we see the brush. What's beyond that? - Beyond what? - "Beyond what"? The brush! A brick wall? A bearded lady? What? Oh, um, it's the highway. It's the highway. Where's the road, Rabbit? Yeah, where's the road, man? It should be any moment. Hello. Shit. She's insane. You're insane, Jo. What are you trying to do, get somebody killed? Oh, really, Jonas? It was so nice of you to stop back there and make sure we were all right. - It was very considerate of you to see 10 people - OK,OK, OK. Alright. - on the side of the road and not stop! - We're through, let's keep this channel clear. Dirtbag. We're going to have to get off of this road. This is no time to guess. I'm not guessing. Just make a right turn. Trust me. Do you want to drive? Just turn! Do we follow? We do not. - What's he doing, now? - Oh. I don't know. Find this road. It's like "Bob's Road." Ha ha ha ha. We've got a touchdown. We have touchdown. Touchdown. Tornado is on the ground. Listen to this. Looks like it's coming down Route 33. Jo, we're on 33. What's the path? Uh, it's going about 35 miles an hour. - Do you see this? - I cannot see this. Where is it? Hello? Where you guys looking? - Where, where, where? - Direction, Rabbit. North northeast. - You see it? - No. You got anything out there? North northeast. You copy? Shit, it's coming right at us. Uh, axis gone vertical-- Gone vertical. Sucker's really gaining strength. You see it? No. But, I can... Beltzer, we don't have a visual. Repeat--we do not have a visual. Help us out here. Where is it? Yeah, I got it, Billy. It's the best motion we've ever seen. It's like the base of this fatty's over a half a mile wide. Rabbit. If you're going east on 7, it should be coming over that hill in a matter of minutes. This is the one, man. I feel it. It's got to be there. Maybe it stalled. No, I think Rabbit's right. It's going to show its ugly face right over that hill. Jo, what do you think? Are you going to go for it, Jo? Jo? Time for deployment, guys. Let's do it. Oh, man. This...This is the fun part, sweetheart. O.K., we got hail. Hail. We got hail. Sanders, pull it over anywhere in here. Here is good. It's good. That's good. - We got a big one, guys. - Whoa-ho-ho. Upflow, Beltzer. We have upflow. Copy? Yeah, Jo, I'm checking. I'm checking it. She's almost up. Bill, right now. This is it. I'll get her ready. Ow! Did you see him? - Did you see him? - What? The red truck going right towards the core. No. He's not talking about Billy, is he? Are you O.K.? I'm all right. Keep going! Hey, Beltzer, we got a view! Yeah, I can see it. All right... I got it. That's no moon. It's a space station! Whoo! Debris. We have debris! Ow! Come on! Come on! O.K.! They're in the birdcage! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Melissa, look at this! Take a peek! - No, I don't want to. - You can really feel it with a telephoto lens. No! Oh, come on! What's the matter? What's wrong? You people are all crazy. Do you know that? What? Dusty, do you set up? We're not leaving till we get this. She's the craziest one of them all. O.K., she's almost ready. Hold on! We're almost there. We're almost there! Whoa! Stop! This is fine. It could shift. - We got to get closer, a little closer! - Come on, Jo! All right, that's close enough. Aah! Aw, fuck! O.K., hurry! Get the tailgate. You got it? Yeah, she's all set. Help me get her down. Hurry! Let's move! Bill, hurry! Damn. We got to go! Now! Come on! We can do this! Come on! Come on! Shit, it's stuck! Ah! Watch it! God! Bill! Get down! Look out! Come on! Hurry! Aah! Look out! Damn. Where'd it go? Where is it? What's going on? Aw, aw, I...I don't believe this. What the hell? What does the Doppler say? The cone of silence. Bill, Jo, it's...it's over. The thing was stable, and--and th-then it's-- It's gone. It's backbuilding. It's not through yet. You're right. It's backbuilding. We got a jumper here. Beltzer, it's backbuilding. You got to track it. Yeah, Jo, we know. Data's incomplete. I think you guys should get out of there. You copy? Bill, help. Bill, help me! Jo, we should leave. No, no, no. - Help me! - Forget the sensors. - Help me! - We got to get out of here now. Beltzer will see it if it drops anywhere near us. It's not going to drop near us. It's going to drop right on us. Bill, turn this-- Wait, wait, wait. No, Bill. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. Go back! Forget it, Jo. Forget it. Go back. It's not too late. Go back! Forget it! It's too late. Help me! Help me. What are you doing? Help me. Jo, the pack's wasted. It's over. What is wrong with you? We can still do this. Jesus Christ, listen to yourself. You're obsessed! You've never seen what that thing can do, so don't talk to me about... I just saw it! You've never seen it! You've never seen it miss this house and miss that house and come after you. Christ, Jo, is that what you think it did? I don't know. Jesus, Jo, why can't you just forget it? You don't understand, O.K.? You'll never know. When's it going to be enough, huh? How close do you have to get? Talk to me. Jo, things go wrong. You can't explain it. You can't predict it. Killing yourself won't bring your dad back. I'm sorry he died, but it was a long time ago. You got to move on. Stop living in the past. And Look at what you got right in front of you. What are you saying? Me, Jo. Excuse me, Doctor, here's your activity report. Hey, Bryce. What? You better get over here. Take a look at this. The gate-- The gate velocities are maxed out. If those two cells converge... lnbounds and outbounds have doubled. This afternoon, a dry line pushed backward into central Oklahoma has backed into western Oklahoma in response to another approaching upper level disturbance. As the disturbance interacts with the dry line, thunderstorms are likely to continue to develop. Some of these storms will likely be severe with tornadoes, large hail, and damaging winds. Due to significant vertical shear, damaging tornadoes are possible. The threat for severe weather is expected to continue through tomorrow morning when the dry line should clear the area. Persons in the listening area should remain alert throughout the night for changing weather conditions and listen for weather statements and possible warnings. ...for several counties. And there have been tornado sightings, the latest reported just to the northeast of Canton. That was a few minutes ago. Hold on a second. I've just been handed this. O.K., this is official now. A tornado has been reported moving through Canton just a few minutes ago. No report... ♪ Skies ♪ ♪ Without stars... ♪ - Oh, my God. - Excuse me. Can I have eight coffees to go, please. Eight? Yeah. ♪ I ♪ ♪ Watched the world ♪ ♪ From a room ♪ ♪ Without a view ♪ ♪ For you left me ♪ ♪ With so few memories ♪ ♪ That I could close my eyes ♪ ♪ And cling to... ♪ Two coffees, please. Long day. Mm-hmm. You know, I been thinking about the sensors-- the way they scattered out there today on the highway. I'm starting to wonder whether the funnel will carry them like we thought. Too light? I don't know. Maybe the whole thing's too light. What can we do about that? I'm not sure. This is a tremendous situation, a very dangerous situation. If you have loved ones in the Canton area, do not try to help them at this point. You'll only be more of a hindrance. Leave the... Thank you. What? Jesus, it's coming. Jo, Bill, it's coming! It's headed right for us! It's already here. Everybody underground now! Billy! Honey! - Come on! - What's going. Jo! Jo! Jo, come on! Get underground! Take cover right now! Go! Lauren! Close the doors! The doors! The doors! Bill! Get inside! Jo, come on! What are you doing? Come back! Come on! Take my hand. - I can't. I can't. - Take my hand! Come on! Take my hand. - I can't. I can't. - Take my hand! We don't mess our lives. Come on! Hurry! Come on. We're alright... Here, get in here. Go, go, go. Come on! Everybody down in the pit! Get down! Let's go, everybody down! Go. Move. Come on. Stay calm. I got it. I got it! Aha! It's O.K. It's O.K. My head... You're O.K. - No, it is not O.K.! It's O.K. It'll be over soon! This is insane! This is insane! Stay calm! This is driving me crazy! I don't want to do this anymore! Aah! Aah! It's O.K., honey. It's going to be O.K. Chewed my lips off wondering if he'd come staggering back home again. I've never been so frightened in my life and my knees were shaking all that way. Was I on key? I couldn't hear a thing. You were on pitch all the way. And it's a wonder... that one of the Maines, Mr. Norman Maine, is still in pictures. Absolutely correct, miss, uh... Blodgett. Esther Blodgett. Ha ha ha ha. Oh, look at the truck. It's trashed! No way... ...happening with the weather in Oklahoma where tornado activity continues. Uh, reports coming in from Fairview indicate a drive-in movie there was blown away. We know there's injuries. We know the damage is massive. We don't know... Is that what it was like up on that hill? That? No. We were lucky. Those were just downdrafts and microbursts. Tornado just sideswiped us. Can you tell which way it's headed? It's, uh, it's backing northeast. A huge tornado on radar. It also indicates a storm. They're extremely dangerous... It looks to hit Wakita head-on. And it looks like a-- directly-- directly toward the Wakita area. And, uh, it's very, very powerful. I'm going. I'm going. Let's go. Aunt Meg. We're going! Where's Beltzer? Get me a route around the storm? Jo, wait. Where's the phone? - The lines are down, Jo. I already tried. - I'm going. Damn it. Hang on, I'll drive. Hey Jo, look, we can jump on the 38 exchange and cross Highway 132. Honey, it's Meg. I got to go. I'm going back. Good. Good. You'll be safe at the motel. I'll see you in the morning. I won't be there. What? Look. What are you saying? I'm saying good-bye- No. You know, I...I can't compete with this. I wouldn't even know where to start. Wait. Don't do this now, please. - Sooner or later, it would've ended. - Please. We both know that. The funny thing is... I'm...I'm not that upset. What does that mean? We can do it. Come on, let's move! I never meant for any of this to happen. Oh, Billy, I know. It's O.K. Bill... Come on. You go ahead. She needs you. I hope that Aunt Meg's O.K. What about you? Oh...don't worry about me. I know my way home. We can be in Wakita in about an hour. Bill, come on. Oh, my God. They had no warning. Oh, my God. Jo, wait! Meg! Meg! Jo, wait. Meg! Careful. Careful. This house could go any second. Meg! Jo, take a flashlight. - The whole place is ready to go. - Meg! Meg! Careful. Meg! Meg! - Meg! - Shh! Did you hear that? What? I can't... Easy does it. Careful. O.K. Meg. Mose, boy. Mose-- She's down here. Meg, we're here. We're coming down. Meg! We got to get this off of her. Hang on. Don't move. Don't move. O.K., ready? Watch your hand. Watch your hand. Go. Go. - Oh. - I got it. Easy. Easy, easy, easy. Are you O.K.? - Are you OK? - No, no. I'm all right. I'm fine. Get down! God, oh. We got to hurry. - Let's go. - You think you can walk? OK, I'm fine. Watch out! Meg! Meg! Meg! Bill! Someone take my watch. Joey, here. Go, go. Careful. Bill! Meg! Bill! We're O.K. We're coming out. - Get an ambulance over here! - Come on. Get an ambulance! Laurence, now! Go! All right. Are you O.K? O.K. I'm fine. How about some steak and eggs? - How nice, you all came over. - There you go. Nice and slow. O.K. - O.K. - Slowly down, Meg. Bill! Grab Mose for me. I think he's a little shaken up. Don't worry. I'll get him. Mose! Is she O.K.? We'll probably keep her overnight just to be safe. Overnight? Forget it. I'm all right. You're going to the hospital. O.K., I'll go, but I'm going to drive myself. Honey, your car's in a tree around the corner. Ohh! It's O.K. It's O.K. Whoa! - Mose! - He's fine, Meg. The F-4 that hit Wakita has now moved on to the northeast. I've just gotten word in that an even stronger tornado has now started to form 25 miles south of Wakita right where the two storm systems have finally met and combined forces. The weather service is saying that this is highly unusual, and they are saying that this latest funnel, this latest tornado could be the strongest F-5 tornado that this state has seen in more than 30 years. Let's break it down, folks. We're talking winds in excess of 300 mph. Hey, what are you doing? I want to see how you are. - How is she? - All right. I was worried about you. Look at this. It's nothing. He says I have a bump on the head and maybe a broken wrist. Let me see that. There's nothing to see. See? It doesn't even hurt. I'm sorry I wasn't there. Stop blaming yourself. You got me out of the house. Jo, it's got to stop. I didn't have any warning. The sirens went off a few seconds before it hit. I didn't even get downstairs. Jo. I'm sorry. Uh... I was listening to the radio, and I don't even know if you want to know, but it's...it's happening. NSSL's predicting an F-5. Jo... it's going to happen to somebody else. You...You go stop it. I don't know how. Well, I think you do. You've been... chasing these things since you were a little kid. It's what you do. Go. Do it. And let's see here. NSSL severe storm staff now confirms... You all right? They also believe this tornado... I thought you should go to the hospital with Meg. - ...long track devastating F-5 ... tornado. -Jo? What is it? It's been an absolutely incredible day. We know Wakita has just been leveled. What is it? I know how to make Dorothy fly. Uh, it's just an unparalleled display of the savage power of nature. There's going to be more tornadoes. Let me just say to you, if you're in the path of any of these storms, just stay alert, and News 89 will keep you advised. Of course. Of course. I need every aluminum can you can find. We need cutters and duct tape. Haynes, Beltzer, I want to get the last Dorothy on the back of my truck, and I want to get them both on there right now. We're gone. Dusty, you ready for us? Yeah, yeah. We're good. - We're good? - Mm-hmm, yeah. - We're good? - We're very good. Let's go. Come on! Did you get them done? I think so. Beautiful! O.K., O.K. - O.K. - Good? Yeah. Great job, you guys. - Just be ready to record. - Right. Be careful, all right? Don't follow too close. All right. You got it, boss. O.K. We're back in business. Come on, let's go. Half a mile more? Sounds right. I figure, put her right in the middle of the road. Unless you think somebody will hit it. Nobody will be there. Hurry! Let's go! Come on! O.K., that's good! You got it? Let's go! Dusty, you in position? Yeah, we're prime. Ready for contact. This is it. It's going to work. Just another minute, Dusty. We're ready for it! Come on, come on, take her! - It's too light. - No, it's not. We're losing it. No, we're not. She can still fly. Get in! Let's go! - My God. - Oh, my God. Come on! - Come on! - Get us off this thing! Come on! Bill, punch it! - Bill! - She's stuck! Bill, go right now! Hurry! What is that? What is that? Bill, hurry. Hurry! Hurry! This is not good. Hurry! - Aah! - Hold on! Let's go! Son of a bitch. Jo, Bill, are you all right? Hey, can you guys hear me'? You O.K.'? We're O.K. Jo, Bill, did you see that explosion? We saw it. This monster's still moving northeast on 80. You copy? This is it. Last one. Last time. Mobile lab to mobile one, Groundspeed is increasing. The base must be at least a mile wide. We can't see it anymore. What is your location? We're right alongside her. She's beautiful. All right, we're getting ready to play, So,... pull back and prepare to monitor. They had to be there somewhere. O.K., path is stable. Copy that. Men, this is it. This is the one. Stay sharp back there. They have position. They could make it. Not unless they anchor the pack. Jonas, this is Jo. Can you hear me'? Not now, Harding. Jonas, listen to me. The pack is too light. The twister will toss it before it reaches the core. You have to anchor it. Oh, sharing valuable information, Jo. O.K., I'll consider that. Thank you. Jonas, listen to me. Don't be a-- What? Can you see them? Jonas, what's your position? Oh, howdy, Bill. We're heading northeast, running parallel, and about to pull ahead of it on the left. Why? Hang back a minute. We got a pretty good view from back here. She could shift her track, and if she does, she's going to come right at you. Do you COPY? Maybe we should do what he says. He'd never put us in harm's way. When I want your opinion, I'll give it to you. Keep your mouth shut, put your foot on the gas, and stay on this heading. It's unbelievable. What is it? What's wrong? The base is so huge. It must be at least a mile wide. Do you copy, Dr. Miller? - Jonas, listen to me. This is not a game! - Get off this frequency, Bill. She's shifting. Oh, my God. Jonas, I'm telling you. Eddie, I know you can hear me. Turn around now! Get out of there! Look out! Damn it! Stupid! We tried. There's nothing we can do. Yes, there is. Bill, Jo, groundspeed is increasing. Get out of it as fast as you can, or she's going to bury you. Debris, Dusty. We have debris! Debris! Right! Left! Right! Left! Duck! What now? I have no idea. Bill, Jo, you still with us? - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. - I think we're going in! - Aah! Maybe we should get off of this road. I think you may be right. Jo, Bill, are you all right? Dusty, you guys set up? Jo, we're set. You going in? We're going in. You ready? I'm on it. Be careful. She's up. O.K. Where are they? I can't see them. Doppler tracking is great. Windspeed still increasing. I've never seen anything like this. They're going to punch the core. You ready? Yeah. Let me just set the cruise control. O.K., we're good. On 3? On 3. Go. Ready? Ready! 1, 2, 3! Go. Go. Go. Go! Go! - Yes! - Yes! We did it! Dorothy's flying! Baby, she's flying, man! Look at that! We're in! We're in! I don't believe it! We made it inside! We're going to be very popular! Baby, she's flying! Look at that. - Hey, it's working, man! - Beautiful! It's Christmastime. We're inside! It's working! We did it! I'm already getting readings! Sweet! We did it, Preacher! We just made history. Hey, you guys, it's about to shift northeast. Bill, I think you guys should get out of there! You copy? Bill, Jo! Do you copy? Oh, no! Run! Hurry! The barn! Come on! Look out! Look out! Bill, here, here! Come on, hurry! To the barn! Stay down! Oh, my God. Who are these people? I don't think so. Come on! Let's get out! Quick! Oh, my God! Come on! Come on! Run for it! Run! Look out! Come on! Get down! Come on! Come on! Get it open up! Jo, get in! Here! These pipes go down at least 30 feet! We anchor to them, we might have a chance! - Ah! - Bill! No good! This one! Come on! Get in! Hold on! Hang on! - You all right? - Are you all right? Wow, look at that. It didn't take the house. ♪ Shine on ♪ ♪ Shine on ♪ We did it. Yeah, we did. Dorothy really flew. It was a good idea. Yeah. Well, I... We've got so much to do. Yeah. I got to get grant approval for a new warning system, we need a bigger lab, you got to start analysis on all that data. I do? Yeah. We got to generate models out of all this data, - and I need to run the lab. - No, no, no. You're doing the analysis. I'm running the lab. - You're running the lab? I don't think so. - I'm running the lab. G-- Do you always have to do things the hard way? You got it, guys! The sensors worked! The computers went crazy! We got data coming out of our ears! The biggest twister on record! Awesome, man! Hey, Jo and Bill, check out that sky. You know what? I think we've seen enough.
