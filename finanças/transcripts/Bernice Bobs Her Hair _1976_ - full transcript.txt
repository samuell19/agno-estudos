(waves crashing) - The year was 1920, the first whiff of the jazz age. F. Scott Fitzgerald had noted its arrival in his first novel, This Side of Paradise. It was the beginning of a rich vein of literary works like The Beautiful and Damned, The Great Gatsby, Tender is the Night, and short stories with opulent titles like The Rich Boy, The Diamond as Big as the Ritz, Winter Dreams, The Ice Palace, Babylon Revisited. A shelf of Fitzgerald's work conveys the essence of the 20s, complete with all the sounds and sights and other textural details that mark him as a brilliant social historian. 1920, it was in that year the Saturday Evening Post first published his short story called Bernice Bobs Her Hair. It's a sparkling story of kids, a melodic introduction to Fitzgerald's lush world where handsome young men toyed with beautiful debutantes amidst the rhythms of cocktail music. There's a good deal of fun here but Fitzgerald took his kids seriously and made them reflect society at large. Bernice's adventures may appear all frolic with little of the bittersweet, haunting emptiness that Fitzgerald was to place at the center of his creations. After all, Bernice is just flirting with the idea of a risque gesture, cutting her hair. But beneath the playfulness, there's a tension, a minor theme about the painfulness of growing up, of being a young woman trying to define herself among the pressures of boyfriends and girlfriends. It's 1920, women in America have just been given the right to vote but the rituals haven't changed that much. Young men still prepare for careers while young women prepare for marriage. Fitzgerald brings it to life for us and it begins, well, where else but on warm, summer evening, the air laced with odor cologne, cigarette smoke, and the sweet sounds of dance music. (upbeat ragtime jazz music) (chattering) - [Woman] Have you seen my jelly beans? I can't find them anywhere. - [Woman] No, I haven't, but I have plenty in my purse. You can borrow one. - [Woman] Oh, do you have red ones? - Red ones, pink ones. - Pink ones? You use pink ones? - [Woman] Yes, during the day. - [Woman] Does your mother know? - [Woman] No, she thinks I have a terrible sweet tooth. (laughing) - [Woman] Marjorie, you saved my life. - Who gave you those gardenias? - Warren. - Warren McIntyre? (giggling) - Who else? - How peculiar. I thought he'd get over you when he went away to Yale. - No, all that happened was I got over him. - Well, I know about three girls in the East that are just wild about him. - Really? I don't know, when you've grown up across the street from someone, he loses his mystery. - Excuse me, Maurice. - Certainly, Bernice. - I'll only be a minute. - That's alright, take your time, Bernice. - Hey, old man. - Why don't some of you dandies cut in? She likes more variety. - What's the matter, Otis? - You're doing just fine. - Just barely picking up steam, old man. - Thanks. (giggling) - Honestly, Marjorie, my brother's been stuck with your cousin, Bernice, for over an hour. - Alright. - Shh, shh. - Oh hello, Bernice. Having a good time? - Oh, yes. - [Genevieve] Hi. - [Bernice] Hello, Genevieve. - Hello, Bernice. - It's just so much hotter here than in Eau Claire. - That's interesting. - We have a breeze there even in the hottest summer. - Really? - I bet you do. - Yup. - Marjorie. - I know, Otis, I know. I'm gonna do something about it. Charles. - Oh, ha. Not me, Marjorie, sorry. - Coming, Genevieve? - Mm-hmm. - Good bye. - Good bye. - Bye, Bernice. - [Marjorie] Warren? - Marjorie, I've been looking all over for you. - Oh, have you? - Darling, where's your corsage? - Oh, well my dress is so pink and the gardenias so white... - That cost me $1.50. - Oh, I'm sorry, but would you do me a favor? Would you dance with my cousin, Bernice? - Your cousin, Bernice? - She's been stuck with Otis Ormonde almost an hour. - I'd say it's the other way around. I'd say Otis Ormonde has been stuck with your cousin, Bernice. - Oh no, she's not that bad. Oh, you don't mind, do you? - Yes, I do mind. I most emphatically do mind. I came here to dance with you, not with your cousin, Bernice. - Well, I'll dance with you a little later. - $1.50. - Just this one dance? - Alright, Marjorie. - Oh, you're an angel. She's in the dressing room. - [Man] Marjorie? - Oh, goodness. - Hi, how are you this evening? - Fine. - You look wonderful. - [Warren] Well, when am i gonna get to dance with you? - [Marjorie] Oh, a little later. - How little? - Good evening, Bernice. - Good evening, Warren. Have you seen Otis Ormonde? - Otis has absconded. - He has? I was just supposed to have this next dance with him. - I hope you don't mind but I'm going to have the next dance with you. - Oh, I don't think so. The floor's too crowded. There's too many people and just too hot. - Oh, oh. Well if you like, we could step out on the veranda. I'm sure there's a breeze out there. - Oh, I don't think so. In Eau Claire, there's a breeze even in a hot summer. - Yes, um, well if you don't want to dance and you don't want to sit out, have you got a better idea? - Oh no, I didn't mean that. Alright, let's go out on the veranda. - Oh look, we could always change our minds. - That's right, we can, can't we? (upbeat jazz music) (chattering) This is humidity. - How? - As compared to Eau Claire. - As compared to Eau Claire. - The temperature could be the same but you just don't feel it as much. (giggling) - Bernice, you have an awfully kissable mouth. - Fresh. - She's ruining my summer. - Marjorie, she's your first cousin and I wish you wouldn't talk like that. - No one ever cuts in on her. I always have to go out and lasso the men to get them to even dance with her. Ardita Ormonde was just telling me yesterday she thought Bernice was very lovely. - Oh mother, please. I know all your friends think she's very sweet and very pretty, what difference does that make? The men don't like her. - Well, I know Bernice isn't very vivacious. - Vivacious? Hmph, good grief. You know, I have never heard her say anything except, "Oh, it's so hot in here," or, "The floor's too crowded," or what school she's going to next year. Then sometimes she does ask them what kind of car they have and then she tells them what kind she has. Thrilling. (light dramatic music) (upbeat ragtime jazz music) (doorbell chiming) - Oh, good morning, Mr. Warren. - [Warren] Good morning, Annie, is Marjorie here? - I'm sorry, Mr. Warren, Ms. Marjorie isn't up yet. - Oh alright, thank you. Oh, I wonder would you know if she's free this afternoon? - No, I believe she's going to a matinee this afternoon. Is there a message? - Oh no, no, thank you. Um, uh. - I told him you weren't up yet, Ms. Marjorie. - [Marjorie] Oh, could you pass me some berries please, Annie? - Good morning. - Good morning, Ms. Bernice. - Morning, thank you. - [Bernice] I don't care for breakfast this morning, Annie. - No? - No, thank you. I heard what you said about me to your mother last night. - Where were you? - In the hall. I didn't mean to listen, at first. I'm ruining your summer, I may as well go home. Your friends don't like me, either. - Well, if you're not having a good time, I suppose you better go. No point in being miserable. - Do you think you've treated me very well? I should think common kindness-- - Oh, please. Don't quote Little Women. I mean, what modern girl could possible live like those ninnies? - They were models for our mothers. - Our mothers? Listen, our mothers were all very well in their day but when it comes to their daughters, they know next to nothing. - Please don't talk about my mother. (laughing) - Ah. (laughing) - I think you're hard and selfish and haven't a feminine quality in you. - Oh, my Lord. Bernice, girls our age divide into two groups. There's the ones like me, who like to have a good time. Then, there's the ones like you, who just love to sit around and criticize us for it. You can go or stay just as you please. (mumbling) - Marjorie, Bernice must not be feeling well, or at least I assume so. She said for you to go to the matinee without her. - I think it's that crazy Indian blood in her. Maybe she's a reversion to type. Indian women just sat around all day and never said anything. - Marjorie, I wouldn't have told you that if I thought you were going to remember it. - [Man] Think of it this way, Charley, it's my machine. - [Charley] Cousin Dopeless is too tall for me, I'm going with Marjorie. - [Man] How do you think I feel? - [Warren] I don't care how you feel. - Oh, who let these two parlor snakes into my house? - [Charley] Atavie saum, Marjorie. - My cousin can't make it, she's sick or something. - Oh, that's too bad. - Gee, that's too bad. - Too bad. - That is too bad. - But hurry, she might recover. (chattering) (upbeat jazz music) (laughing) - Whoo! (laughing) (knocking on door) - [Josephine] Bernice? - Yes, Aunt Josephine? - [Josephine] Are you feeling better, dear? - I'm alright, Aunt Josephine. I'm just writing my mother. - [Josephine] Will you come down? Young Draycott Deyo is here to see you. - Alright, Aunt Josephine. (light jazz music) - Are you enjoying your visit? - Oh, yes. How are your studies coming along, Draycott? - Very well, thank you. - You're studying to be a doctor? - A minister. - Oh. You weren't at the dance last night, were you? - At the country club? No, I understand it was even noisier than usual. - The floor was crowded. - A noisy, crowded dance floor is my pet abomination. In my opinion, some of our generation will end up dancing themselves to death. - Oh, no. - Oh, yes. Present company excepted, of course. No one could ever accuse you of such a thing. - I guess not. (footsteps approaching) - Well, come right in. - I've decided that maybe you're right about things. Possibly. - Of course I am. - And if you'll tell me what it is that I do wrong, I'll see what I can do. - Do you mean it? - Yes. - You'll do everything that I tell you to do? - If they're sensible things. - You're no case for sensible things. - Are you gonna recommend-- - Everything. If I tell you to take boxing lessons, you're going to do it. Write home and tell your mother you're gonna stay an extra two weeks. Where are you going? - To write my mother. - You can do that later, sit down. I have so much work to do on you, I can't lose a minute. First off, it's your personal appearance. - Don't I look alright? - No. You're also a bad conversationalist, personality's boring. You lean on men when you dance with them. - I do not. - Yes, you do. - You haven't the vaguest idea of how to make a man fall in love with you. Willing to admit all that? - Maybe. - No maybes. - Alright, but how are you gonna fix all that in just two weeks? - Well if you'll pay attention, I can fix it in two days. Oh, when you go home, you've got to have your teeth straightened. Until then, just smile with your mouth closed. Think of Mona Lisa. Better. - You mean Mona Lisa's teeth were crooked? - Well, of course. - How do you know all of these things? - Oh, you just learn them along the way. (upbeat jazz music) Why aren't you saying anything? - Well, you aren't either. - I'm the man, the girl always makes the conversation. - It's hard to think of something. - Bernice, when you're with a man, there are only three topics of conversation: you, me, and us. - Maybe it would help if I knew who you were. - [Marjorie] Pick somebody. - You pick. - Anybody, um, Warren McIntyre. - Why'd you pick him? Are you going back to college soon? - Oh Bernice, that's just thrilling. - Well, you said you, me, and us. - But what can he say except, "Yes, I am," or "No, I'm not." And who cares anyway? Is it true what I hear about Yale men, Warren McIntyre? - What did you hear? - Oh, that they're fickler than other men. He'd probably say, "Who told you?" And I'd say, "Oh, didn't mind, I just hope it's truth "'cause I think fickle men are much more interesting, "more of a challenge." (giggling) Sure fire actually, I use it all the time. - What would you do if he said something like, "You have an awfully kissable mouth." - What's your criteria for a kissable mouth? One that looks like it's been kissed a lot or one you'd like to kiss? - Whoo, Marjorie, have you ever? - Oh of course, lots of times. - But if you're a nice girl from a good family... - You like to have just as much fun as everybody else. - Did you ever kiss Warren? - Oh of course, lots of times. I want you to use this cream every night. - On my face? - On your face, on your hands, your elbows, your knees. - My knees? Who'll ever see my knees? - Oh, lots of people if you work it right. - Marjorie, did you really turn three cartwheels at the Pump and Slipper Dance at Yale? - Five. (whistles) Oh, that's old hat. We'll think up something better for you. I know, we could bob your hair. - Marjorie. - Alright, it was just a thought. Tell you what, though, would make a terrific line. - [Bernice] Marjorie, you better get dressed, it's almost time. - I think I'm gonna put Roberta on the other side of Charley Paulson. That'll be good practice for you. If you can get a man to pay attention to you with Roberta Dillon on the other side, you know you've got what it takes. (doorbell chiming) - Marjorie. - Good, now I can get dressed. (doorbell chiming) - [Annie] Good evening, Mr. Warren. Ms. Marjorie's dressing but Ms. Bernice is down. (chattering) - [Roberta] Oh hello, Bernice. (chattering) - [Warren] Where's Marjorie? - [Bernice] Oh, she's upstairs getting ready. (chattering) - [Marjorie] I wanna talk to you for a minute. - What's wrong? (door slams) - You weren't even trying. If you've been wasting my time, I'll never forgive you. Oh, you might as well go home. - No. - Well then, get out there and do something. (chattering) - Mr. Charley Paulson? Do you think I ought to have my hair bobbed? My hair, you think I ought to bob it? - Why, Bernice? - I want to be a society vampire and I don't see how I can unless I have my hair bobbed, do you? - Well, I don't know, Bernice. - I decided to ask your opinion because I heard you're so critical of girls. - What are you talking about down there? - I was just telling Charley that first thing next week, I'm going down to the Sevier Barber Shop, sit in the first chair and have my hair bobbed. (chuckling) Of course, I'll have to charge admission but if you'll all come down and encourage me, I'll issue passes for the front row seats. - I'll take one, front and center, right now. - Me, too. - Bernice, I thought bobbed hair was only for the picture show vamps. Would you really do it? - I know it's unmoral but my philosophy is that you have to either amuse people, feed 'em, or shock 'em. (laughing loudly) (upbeat jazz music) - What did you mean before when you said that I was critical of girls? - It's just what I've heard. I heard it practically the minute I got to town. - Who told you that? - Several people. - Who? - Guess. - Male or female? - Charley? - Wait a minute, Harvey. - Take your pick. - Nuts. - Uh, are you really gonna bob your hair? - First thing next week, gonna come? - Sure. - I heard something about the men that go to Princeton. - Yeah? - And I just wanted to know if it was really true. Will you be honest with me? - Alright. - Just promise me you won't tell Mr. Julius Stoddard. - Tell me what? - Okay, what? - [Bernice] I'm afraid you'll get mad at me. - Oh, I won't, tell me. (laughing) Who told you that? - Nevermind. - I think I'll put something else on, Bernice. - Alright. I just hope it's true because fickle men are the only kind that interest me. They're more of a challenge. - Is that a fact? - [Charley] Would you hurry up, Roberta? - I can't find anything good, Charley. - Don't you have something more romantic? - Just don't rush me. - I'd like to get another dance in with Bernice, if you don't mind. - Bernice? Did you say Bernice? - Yes, I said Bernice. - Charley Paulson, have you lost your mind? - Would you just please hurry up, Roberta? - You tell me to hurry up once more, I'm gonna slap your face. - Shh. - [Man] Hey Roberta, let's just listen to the same one. Come on. - Once around the boards, Bernice? - Charley, would you hold this? Thank you. (upbeat jazz music) Now. Be careful, he's Yale. - Thanks, you're awful nice. - Why do you keep looking over there J.B.? - They're good dancers. - Bernice and Warren? I think we're much better than they are. - Oh, I suppose we are, aren't we? - What do you mean suppose? Aren't you sure? Very. (giggling) - How do you feel about the hair bobbing issue? Do you think a woman should bob her hair? - I think women should feel free to indulge themselves, depending on the shape of their heads, of course. You're not seriously considering doing it, are you? - Of course I am. Did you think it was just a line? The only one in this room with a line is Mr. Warren McIntyre. - I beg your pardon? - You have an awfully kissable mouth, Bernice. (giggling) I meant to ask you, what is your criterion for a kissable mouth? One that looks like it's been kissed a lot or one you'd like to kiss? - One I'd like to kiss, of course. - Thank you, Warren. That's very handy information. Don't you just love the ocean? - Bernice, your hair is like the spray on the ocean on a moonlit night. - Oh, Charley Paulson, you devil. I heard you could make a girl believe almost anything. (knocking on door) - Oh, Mr. Otis, Ms. Marjorie's gone downtown with her mother. - That's funny, Charley Paulson's sister said he was over here. - He is. - But what's he doing over here if Marjorie's downtown? - Bernice-- - Hey Paulson, what about our game? - My vernoose, I forgot all about it, Otis. - It's alright, if you hurry we can still play a set or two. - Uh, I'll take a rain check, thank you. - What do you mean? - I mean I'm busy right now, Otis. - Busy doing what? - I'll see you later, Otis. (upbeat jazz music) - Hello Bud, Marjorie's downtown. - Where's Bernice? - Bernice, what? - You know, I have such a frightful lot of hair. You know what I've taken to doing? - [Charley] What? - First, I powder my face and fix my hair, then I put on my hat, hop into the tub, and then I get dressed. No hearts, Charley? - Uh, oh, sorry. - Charley... - Don't you think that's a wonderful plan, my bathtub plan? - I think it's first rate. - I love it, Bernice. - You've got the smile down pat but now you have to perfect the pathetic look, too. - Why? - Well, it comes in handy in certain situations. - With men? - Well, of course with men. When you go east to school, you're gonna run into Babs Finley. - The one that got fired from Ms. Walker's? - Oh, she's been fired from three schools that I know of, maybe more. Anyway, she has probably got the greatest pathetic look of any girl of our generation. - How do you do it? - Open your eyes wide, now you droop your bottom lip, and you look straight into the man's eyes and say, "I hardly have any bows at all." - I hardly have any bows at all. (laughing) - Not bad. - I thought the idea was to seem popular. - Oh, but it only works if you're popular. Can you imagine an unpopular girl saying, "I hardly have any bows at all." (giggling) What could the man say? But if you're popular, see. - Do you think I'll ever know all these things you do? - Well, I don't know, you got a late start. - I don't think I'm doing so bad. How'd you like my bathtub line? - Snazzy. (giggling) - You can use it if you want to. - Bernice, I don't need to use other people's lines. (light jazz music) - [Annie] Ms. Bernice? - Hello, Shell Shock. - Annie? - Yes, Ms. Marjorie? - Who was that? - [Annie] It was Mr. Warren, Ms. Marjorie. - Oh, well tell him I can't see him right now. - [Annie] He just took Ms. Bernice out for a ride. - Oh, well I'm glad he finally found someone who appreciates him. (light jazz music) - [Warren] So, Marjorie totally poisoned you against me. - Oh Warren, no, not at all. Are you still in love with Marjorie? - No. Marjorie is a true vivacious spirit. I responded to her great joie de vivre. I do not respond, however, to her turning five cartwheels at the Pump and Slipper Dance. - You need someone more stable, that's all. - I would hope so. I would be mortified if she started turning cartwheels in my home. What would the children think? I'm losing patience with Marjorie. If she can't see me for who I am at this point in my life, I'd be a twerp not to look elsewhere. - Oh Warren, I could never think of you as a twerp. You're a handsome man, you know. - Thank you. I don't wanna seem vain talking about my looks. - Oh, you don't. - I hope not. - Oh, no. - Do you think my hair would look better parted in the middle rather than on the side? I've been thinking of doing it. - Oh, I don't know. It sort of enhances your widow's peak. - Thank you. - Warren, will you write me when I go back to Eau Claire? - I'm going to write about you. I think you're a remarkable girl. - Are you studying to be a writer? - I don't like to talk about it. I can only say that I'm trying to reveal myself as honestly as I possibly can, under an assumed name, of course. - A pen name? - Oh, yes. - What is it? - Charlotte van Heusen. - Charlotte? - I don't want anyone to know it's me. I'm in too much pain. - Oh, Warren. - I tell you, I'm at a point in my life where I don't have time for anything but the truth. Life is too short and I'm getting too old. - [Bernice] How old are you? - 19, I'm going through something very important in my life. It's hard to explain. I have a lot of energy. Every muscle, every, every sinew, I'm full. I'm full of sap. - I'd never know it, you certainly look healthy. (light jazz music) - I could get him back, just like that. (snaps fingers) - Could you? - [Marjorie] Oh, you might as well get Warren McIntyre out of your head. - What? - Stop making a fool of yourself. Warren McIntyre doesn't give a fig about you. - You act like I stole your private property. - I'm not interested in discussing it, now or later. (laughing and chattering) - [J.B.] Hey Paulson, when are you going back to kindergarten? - Me? - Yes. - Day Bernice gets her hair bobbed. - [Marjorie] Oh, well then your education's over. - Huh? - Well, that was just a bluff, I thought you realized that. - You mean that was just a line? - I don't know. - Oh splush, admit it. (giggling) Splush. (laughing) - [Charley] Give her what for, Bernice. - I like bobbed hair and I intend to bob mine. - When? - Any time. - No time like the present. - Bon, we'll have a summer hair bobbing party. Yes, Sevier Barber Shop, isn't that what you said, Bernice? - That's what I said. - [J.B] Come on, Roberta. - [Charley] Great, now? - Yeah! - Come on, Bernice. - [Marjorie] Don't worry, she'll back down. - Alright, I don't mind if I do. (light jazz music) - [Man] You see all these kids out here? - [Warren] Come on, Bernice! - I want you to bob my hair. - Excuse me, Miss? - You know how, don't you? - I've cut men's hair but I've never cut ladies' hair before. You're not funnin' me, are ya? - Oh no, I've decided to. - Don't touch the barber's stuff. You're not joking with me, you have very lovely hair. You wanna have your hair bobbed? - Good heavens, just do it. - [Barber] Well, just have a little patience and if we do it, we'll do it right. - Alright. Why don't you take your seats? - [Charley] Oh, we can see fine from here, Bernice. - [Barber] Excuse me. - Just don't get in the way, Charley. It's a delicate operation. - Well, you know what they say. Hair today, gone tomorrow. (chuckling) - This is so you don't get blood on your clothes, Bernice. - Wonderful. - [Barber] Excuse me. - Why don't you just let me do that? I can do it much faster. - You can back down if you want. - Why should I? (scissors snipping) - [Barber] Well, I guess that's it, Miss. - Well, I did it. - That's right. - Yes, you sure did, Bernice. - [Bernice] How do you like it? - [Warren] It's different, Bernice. It's really interesting, it looks fine. - [Otis] Yeah, that's it, Bernice, it looks fine. - Yeah. - Bravo. - But how do you make it look like those vampires? - I think it looks real sweet, Bernice, I like it. - Thank you, Roberta. - Um, would you mind doing me a favor? - What? - Would you run me to the dry cleaners? I simply have to pick this dress up before seven. - [Warren] Oh sure, I'd be glad to. - Roberta, you wouldn't mind driving everyone home, would you? - [Roberta] Oh no, of course not. - I told you I'd do it and I did it. - You did. - That's right. - [Warren] Well, we have to go, Bernice. Well, Bernice, we'll see you later maybe. - [Charley] Tomorrow. - Alright. - Bye. - See ya. Who's gonna take me home? - Me, I'll wait for you outside. - I'll see you in a few minutes. Thanks. - Marjorie, if you and Bernice aren't busy tomorrow afternoon, I thought perhaps we might go down to Partridge's for tea. Ardita Ormonde and Genevieve will be there around 3 o'clock and perhaps we could all do a little shopping afterward. Oh Bernice, what will your parents say? They'll think I let you do it. - I'm sorry, Aunt Josephine. - I'm awfully sorry, Bernice. - It's alright. - Maybe we could wet it so it won't stick out like that? - It's alright. - I really didn't think you'd go through with it. - Does it matter? - Well, you'll get used to it maybe. - I'm used to it now, I like it. - Well, for heaven's sakes, don't let it worry you. - I won't. - Life's too short. - Yes. - Night, Bernice. - Good night, Marjorie.
