Give me homicide. This is a friend of Marty Prince's, he's just been scratched. You'd better drop around. Did you record the time on that call? - Yes, sir 9:01. - Good. I want two cars in about five minutes. Okay. - Radio. - Cars 49, 50, 51. Van Ness to Embarcadero, Market to Fisherman's Wharf. Close both bridges and Highway 101. Lock her up until you hear from me, got it? Got it, any description? Not yet, stand by in half an hour. Want me to stop? No, no, finish the job, this is in the bag anyway. I'll never understand why a guy commits a crime in San Francisco. With only three exits, the guy should know he's a fly in a bottle. - Who done what? - Marty Prince, somebody finally got him. Without even trying, I can think of three good prospects. Somebody should get a medal when he goes to the gas chamber. - Goodnight. - Thanks, goodnight. Making with the phone was smart, you had the guts to report your own mistake, it'll take the heat clean off you, if you can just make Connie's place in seven minutes. You've got no car and they know it, so how could you have given it to Marty and be at Connie's seven minutes later? Lookey here, there's a fella bound and determined to get somewheres in a hurry. He oughta relax, spend a little time with us. For the love of might, Connie, if you're not here the whole idea cracks open, you gotta be. I made it in six and a half minutes, but if you're not home, Connie, it's no good. Oh, great, too much running, oh Connie. Oh, you're a genius all right. Get yourself out of this town right now, before they close it up. Yeah. And now they've closed the Bay Bridge and the highway south will be crawling with coppers. Hey Barney. Well, Hamill, when did you get in? This afternoon just before the fog by golly. Tell me Hamill, how's your son coming along huh? Carl be like the long line fisherman now, be fishing the hard way for a young fellow. Bringing a son all alone like you done, it's a tough job, Hamil but now's no time to be discouraged. All kids they get into some kind of trouble before they settle down. Did you get him all straightened out with the police yet? Yeah, Barney, the judge have long talk with Carl and me. I think that judge very smart man and Carl turn out all right. Oh, sure he will. I better go home quick enough before it's too late. What time you sail in the morning? Four o'clock. Good fishing and goodnight. Take a long chance, fella, you found San Francisco's fourth exit. Wait outside, huh? Bruno, hey! Disappointed, Connie? How do you know my name? It's on the buzzer plate. You get out of here before I call my husband. You haven't got a husband, now sit down and relax. Is that badge entitle you to barge into an apartment anytime you want? Sit down and stop trying to be a lawyer. My name is Kelsey and I don't enjoy being up here at this hour anymore than you do. But we want words with your friend, Felkin tonight. He lives at the Pacific Hotel. Oh we know that and we know among other things, he spends a lot of time around here. Look it's 3 a.m. now and Bruno's decided not to go back to his hotel last night, where'd he go? I wouldn't know, Mr. Kelsey. Lieutenant Kelsey please. Now when were you last arrested? I've never been arrested. Oh, look, I'm just trying to save us the trouble of looking at the files. Where you from and how old are you? 20, oh five I guess huh. Lessing, Nebraska and I'm 23. Hmm, you're an old-looking 23. How would you like a slap in the face? Now, come to think of I guess you're right. Things always just seemed to work out that I had to be older than I should be. - Ever married? - No. I hate to admit it but nobody ever asked me. If I knew what was wrong, I'd do something about it. - Parents alive? - I've been an orphan since I was 11. What do you claim for an occupation? I sell hats. Oh, where's the shop? Men give them their hats and a little while later I sell them back. Pretty nice apartment for a hat shake girl. Where I work the customers are generous. No doubt. Look, Connie, lies I write down, the truth I keep in my head. Now how did you get mixed up with Felkin and don't make me write everything down, huh? I like Bruno. Can't you find some better company? He's been pretty wonderful to me. Sure he has, did he ever tell you he's a three time loser? Yes, he did. You must be in love with him. - What's Bruno done? - Killed a man. - I don't believe you. - Why not? Well, he couldn't have, he was with me all the time. - All what time? - All day yesterday and today up until like a couple hours ago. I was lying when I said I didn't know where he was, he left just before you came. You're a very poor liar, Connie. After 12 years on the force, I've seen a lot of apartments. They all tell a story. Yours is a good example, the way a blind man can see there was only one person here last night. Chances are that person was you. Connie I hate to see you sent up for A&A. What's that? Aiding and abetting. In this state it gets you up to five years, so? You're not scaring me. Well, think it over just the same. Look, I'm gonna stick around, if you wanna go back to bed, go ahead but if the phone rings, we sort of answer it together, understand? You talk and I listen. I have to go to school today. School, what's this school business? It's Bruno's idea, he thinks I got a lot to learn. Well, we all do. For instance, I just learned you can never be sure what a smart criminal like Bruno is gonna think of next. He's not a criminal! If he ever was one, he's changed. The ones like Bruno never change. I've never seen or talked to your Bruno but I'm willing to bet he's really two people. One, the side he shows you, he's probably quite a nice guy. All the smart ones are that way. He might even wanna play things straight. But something eats away at a man like Bruno, like acid in a battery. The outside case looks fine but inside the plates are rotten. He knows he'll never get what he really wants but he'll try, oh he'll try. And he won't let anybody stand in his way. Connie why don't you get some sleep for yourself. I couldn't sleep now. You want some breakfast? Don't tell me you can cook. It's the one thing I learned to do right, maybe because I like it. Two then, sunny side up. You look to me like a man who would like them easy. Right, Connie, easy. I was hoping last night making it to the beacon together, Carl. Just because we have a good catch is no reason to spend all your share, get the big headache. I'll work for it, I'll spend it like I want. Yeah, of course. But if you spend only a little, you get only a small headache. And you can work much better next day. Get wise to yourself, this is America not the old country. Work is for jerks. You've been here for 27 years now, what have you got to show for it besides this stinking boat. Fishing is good honest living, Carl. We have never any cause to feel ashamed. D for the W. Just keep saying W's for another 27 years and maybe you'll hit one right. Now just stay out of my business, be sure I'll stay out of yours forever. I wish you could feel different, Carl. Your mother would have like it that way. Hey, we've got a passenger. I'm sorry, mister, I guess I had one too many last night, I decided to take myself for a little walk and I wind up on the wharf. All of a sudden I'm so sleepy I can hardly keep my eyes open. I don't remember exactly but your boat looks like a good place to lie down and the next thing I know here I am. Come inside, catch cold with no coat. I'm sure sorry, mister. You see I'm a salesman and business has been bad and I've had a lot of personal worries lately and I guess I was feeling sorry for myself. I don't like to put back now, we miss the tide, we'll lose a day. Well, I wouldn't wanna be taken back, I got nothing to do, I have no place to go, nothing, you understand? But we go to sea, three, four days maybe. That's fine, I'll pay you for the food I eat. When this bucket hits the open ocean, you won't be eating anything. I'm short of cash but I could let you have this watch as security and if I stayed I could maybe do the dishes or. Have you gone to sea before? I'm not exactly an admiral but I feel great. Would you like a cup of coffee? Yeah, yeah, if it's not too much trouble. What name do they call you? Bruno. Is that all? Felkin. I am Hamil Linder, my son, Carl. Who's steering this boat or is there a ghost town boy. The old man finally broke down and bought the automatic pilot. Steering's the only thing he doesn't do the hard way. I suppose by and by they invent the machine to make the fish jump onto it. That'd be a fine day, so Carl? Let the fish go their way, I'll go mine. - Do you swim? - First class. When I was a kid it was free in the river, it was one thing I could afford. Good. The only dangerous thing about fishing maybe is to fall overboard. It's what I keep saying to Carl because he never cared to learn. So, if you be careful I think it be all right for you to come along. Next to farming, this be probably the oldest business in the world, Bruno. This long lining be used the same for 2,000 years maybe more. Did you know that four of Christ's apostles were fisherman? I'm not quite up on those things. Each basket have 225 hooks on it's line. You set them along the trough here and be fastened into one basket to the beginning of the next and have one continuous line. How long a line does that make? About a mile. The hooks are set one fathom apart. Now, over goes the marker buoy so, over goes the first anchor, so it sinks down about 1800 feet. And over go the ground lines with the hooks, very fast. This I gotta see. How do you know there's any fish down there? Ah, that's where you use your noodle. By and by we take some soundings and commence to think like a fish. What's that? That'd be the sun. You never see the sun before? I've never see the sun rise just like that in my whole life. Right now I did. Then I think you see many things in that little time you be to sea with us, if you're heart take the time to look for them. Such things have always been here and always will be. That be not a bad set I think. Now it takes 14 minutes to sink to the bottom. By and by the fish have breakfast. Meanwhile, we have a little sleep. Mind if I ask what's bothering you? You can ask. This kind of life just doesn't happen to suit my talents. Why take it out on your pop? For my money, he's a pretty good guy, you're lucky. I wished my old man had been like him. He's all right, we just got different ideas, he's old country, wants to work his head off all day. Yeah, I see what you mean. There's no sense to it these days. If a fellow can't have a car, a few women and time to enjoy themself, why bother? Come September I'll have all of that. Why wait? The judge said I had to. He gave me a choice of five years in jail or a year on this boat. No matter how you slice it, he fixed me up on hard labor. What do they have on you? I borrowed a car without exactly getting the owner's full permission. You mind if I give you some good advice? I've heard it before, stealing isn't honest. It's worse than that, it's dumb. Stealing is for jerks who don't know their way around. What you oughta have is something that works for you while you sleep. You've got some fancy ideas for a salesman. What makes you think I swallowed your story about drinking so much, you just fell on this boat? I happen to have a nice steady business that might have an opening for a nice fellow like you, providing you can learn to keep your mouth shut. What makes you think I can't now? You wouldn't have told me about the car, if you'd had learned. How would you like to make 200 a week? How'd I like to be Rockefeller? But selling is not for me. Well, you go into port pretty often, don't you? Two or three times a week. What I need you for wouldn't take more than a few hours every time. I have a lot of expensive equipment stashed here and there around town. People give me their money, at least I can do is collect it. What's the catch? Once in awhile there's a slight disagreement in regard to percentage and insurance on a machinery. People let their instincts run away with their heads. You've gotta reason with them and twist their heads back into shape. Now a big man can always get himself some respect in such negotiations. I see. It so happens I could use a little vacation out in the open air like this. It'd be good for me. If your pop would let me stay on the boat, I could sort of operate by remote control. He'll think you're crazy, why don't you ask him? First I need a good executive vice-president with a strong arm, one who don't ask or answer questions. For 200 you found your man. I'm gonna phone in. Hello, Kelsey speaking. I'm leaving the Thatcher place now. Put on a 24 hour watch but don't bother anybody till you hear from, got that? No, let her wander around all she wants. She may meet some interesting people. Bless your rotten old heart. One of the nights, she's gonna sink right out from under us. It's even odds, Virginia, which happens first, do we drown or do we starve? Hey fella? Well, we lose our happy home for sure. Can we have a little talk? Well, you'd better talk fast or we'll all be swimming. I can't pay even if she does own my beloved, marrying that woman would be a fate worse than death. What woman? Johnnie Mae Swanson, didn't she send you? No, no, no, we don't even know your lady friend. We just have a few routine questions. Ah, well, if you ain't from Johnnie Mae, welcome aboard. I'll tell when to put on life preservers. Were you around the wharf last night? Well, I always am, me and cities don't mix. Make me so doggone nervous I can't stay sober in them. Did you see anything unusual? No, I had a bath up at the mason, me and Virginia come to bed early. What time did you go for your bath? Well, it was eight or 8:30. Walking home me and Virginia took our time, I don't know, it might have been nine, why make any difference? Well, it could. There's a character loose in the neighborhood we'd like to talk to. Did you ever see any of these men before? I don't know, I, seems like I've seen all of them one time or another. You know it's a funny doggone thing, ever since I've been staying sober, I'm awful unreliable in the head, get that feeling about most everyone. Mighty peculiar how last night- Corky, hello, ya-hoo! Quick arrest me, throw me in the doggone tank for life. Hello, ya-hoo! Can't you see I'm in conference Johnnie Mae, dear. And with such nice-looking men. If you should see any of the men on these pictures, spend a nickel on a phone call to homicide, ask for Lieutenant Kelsey, you'll get your nickel back. So happens I don't have one of those things. Here. What if I dial the wrong number? Get it right the second time. You're so handsome in the morning, Corky. If you come to repossess the California State you better higher yourself a diarer. No, a voice came to me in my dreams last night. Yeah, how could he got a word in edgewise? The voice said I should give you another month and any man that has the strength to forsake the bottle on his own was worth waiting for. For 165th time I ain't about to marry you, boat or no boat, voice or no voice. You ain't getting any younger, Corky. Well, then why don't you let an old man be, go look somewheres else. 30 days, Corky Mulder and not one minute more. 30 days! Well, Virginia, anyway here's coffee for me and a bone for you. Watch your hands there, Bruno, careful you don't catch a hook. Get this, Bruno, get a look at two extra hours of work tonight. Pretty soon you'll know what I mean about no fish ever hearing of union hours. Looks to me like we're about through for the day. How about that, are you gonna tell him or should I? Maybe you'd better, I haven't got the heart. Yeah, you're almost finished with the baskets but we still have to make ready for tomorrow. We're through for the day when the last hook and flagger aboard. All we have left to then is to clean about a ton and a half of fish, stow them in the hold and the liveries in cans. Then we swab down the decks for exercise. After supper, we remake these baskets, then Bruno you can get some night's sleep. Sure, you oughta be through by midnight. But sleep fast because we start all over again at 4 a.m. Get some pliers and iodine. So, that be too bad. It's my fault. I wasn't being careful like you told me. Now we have to take it out. It will hurt pretty much. Do you wanna a drink - to kind of? - Not thanks. Steady son. There. There you have a lot of nerve, Bruno Felkin, most men yell pretty loud. Now you best go lie down. Would a regular fisherman lie down? Sometimes but you don't have to fish. Well, I want to if you'd let me. That'd be crazy, why? I don't know, I just got a hunch that I like this kind of life. Maybe so, maybe so. Is everything straight now? As soon as you give me the list of addresses, I'm on my way. You find a machinist that monkeys with you, have a serious talk with whoever runs the joint about his life insurance. No matter how they squirm, cash on the line, understand? You tell me when to breathe too? Just swing your weight around and you'll find out. Now when you're through with the collections, go to 399 Chestnut, ring a bell marked Connie Thatcher. If she isn't there, wait until she does get there. Make sure she's alone. Give her $100 and tell her to keep on getting good grades no matter what. Tell her not to worry about a thing. I'll be in the front row on graduation day. And anybody leaves a dog listen to me is an ostrich. I say the fishermen got any help from the government like the farmers. What is we need is no government, no government at all. I know what it's like to be a fisherman. - Man and boy I- - The farthest you've been to see is a fall off this here dock. Say that again you runt. - Now listen General. - Ian started everything. The next time I see you pick on a little guy, I'll cut you down to half his size, go behave yourself. Do I make myself clear? Perfectly. Fine morning, Corky. Yeah, fine day for suicide. Fact of the matter is, I've spent so much money on my boat I ain't been feeding too well lately. It's always tough when you're trying to outfit, Corky. All right, can't be just exactly sure when I can pay this much back. You give me a five spot last week. So what, one of these days you're gonna sink your boat with fish. You're the best fisherman in the harbor, Corky I'm not worrying a minute. If I was a little younger- You're the youngest guy I know. See you around, Corky. But I can never. No matter what anybody says, Virginia, there goes a man. - Who is it? - I have a message for you from Bruno. All right, flatfoot bring your bags with you. Oh wow, they're getting younger and younger. What are you a junior G-man? I happen to be a fisherman temporarily. Why's it all cops are so big, aren't there ever any little cops? - Might try hiring a few. - What? Little men are smarter, there's not so much space between their ears. Do you want Bruno's message or not? Oh come on in. For the 50th time, I don't know where Bruno is. I do and I'm not a cop. Like where? At my old man's boat. I like Bruno's slot machine business and I like his taste in- Make yourself right at home, don't mind me. Oh, Bruno said not to worry about anything and to take this. I've never seen a cop with hands like yours, what do you do wash them with sandpaper? I've been using my back instead of my brains. - How is he? - He's okay. He talked my old man into teaching him fishing. You don't look like a fisherman or act like one. - What's your name? - Carl. You know this is a nice place, a very cozy little place. I wouldn't be surprised if we could find a lot to talk about. That's what I like a man with a new approach. Now let's get something clear in your head and we'll save a lot of energy. I got a lot to spare. If you don't understand me the first time, I'll gladly repeat for you. Bruno Felkin may not be the most respectable citizen in San Francisco or big and handsome but he cares what happens to me and he needs me enough to make me feel important. That's quite a full bill. Maybe someday I'll change my mind but right now Bruno is enough for me. I still think we oughta get to know each other better. Now how about putting on your boots and coming out for a steak? I'm a vegetarian this year. Run along, junior. Your promise can take a vacation. I'm warning- Would you like to try another round or have you had enough? If you treat all your boyfriends like this, you'll wind up an old maid. I've met enough fools in my time to overrun Siberia, I'm sick and tired. I can see that. Go on, get out of here, before I lose my temper. Connie, I might bleed to death. Get a transfusion and come back when you grow up. You're quite a girl, Connie, I'll have to tell Bruno. He knows it, you just tell him Connie will be waiting. Come on. Anybody home? Well, where's Hamill? He went off with an old friend, Barney something or other. Oh, well, I'll just have coffee. Helps to fight the yearning, having coffee. That's why I drink it all the time. You understand there was 20 years when I couldn't afford to stay sober, wine two bits a bottle. This kind of night, the yearning gets doggone powerful. Used to be just into the tank and out of the tank for me, till that one night I woke up on a marble slab down at the county hospital, no pulse, you understand, mate, none at all. They was overhasty with Corky Mulder. I'm all signed DOA when I pushed the sheet from my face and I sat straight up. The intern says either something's wrong with his apparatus or I'm a member of the cat family. That did it, not a drop has wet this hook since. You're the new feller ain't you? Yeah. I heard Hamil signed on a new family, and he's got dern lucky. Hamil knows the names and addresses of every fisherman in the Pacific Ocean. Yes sir, if I get enough money to fix up my boat so she won't sink, I'm gonna tag right onto to Hamill and fish what he fishes. Well, I guess I talk too much don't I mate? You seem to have a lot on your mind. Ah, a fella gets that way when he's alone too much. Carl's the only one around the wharf who'll pay any attention to me. He knows I'm gonna make out all right. He knows so well that he always comes through if I'm a little short. Wonderful fella. Well, if he's so wonderful, why don't he treat his pop better? You know I wondered that same thing many a time myself. It's a natural goddarn shame they can't see eye to eye. By golly mate I've seen you somewhere before. Let me think where that could have been. I spent a lot of time on the East Coast, you might have seen me in New York. No, no, never been to New York. Let me just see if I can't guess now. Sure getting old when I can't remember a face I seen as plain as yours. Well, the last four years I spent up in Canada. No, no, never been to Canada either. Where in the almighty tarnation could I had? Mighty fine-looking dog, must have a good pedigree. Say, ain't you the fella I seen running up Battery Street the other night like you was running from some woman? You're really mixed up. If you had seen a woman running in front of a man, that might have me chasing her. But never running away from one. Well, must have been your twin brother. Sure rattles my brain when I get to thinking I seen somebody and it turns out I never did. Too much saltwater and alcohol in the old age I guess, must have rusted my brain. Yeah, it reminds of a thing from the Bible, it goes as follows. Beware ye who rise up each day with a yearning for strong drink. That was another thing we had to learn before the missions give us breakfast in them days. Wine is a viper, strong drink is the devil and whoever is deceived thereby a fool. Pretty fancy words. Well them words got us breakfast. I'll never forget them words as long as I live. Well, I suppose as good at faces as I have with words, I'd be all dern sure where I seen you. Don't worry, mate, one of these days it'll come to me. That'll be 19 skins, Corky. A mere pittance. Cash on the line Mullins they call me. Wait a couple of minutes, I'll get your change for you. No, light's going out, Mullen's waits for no man, present it to the boys up there. When Johnnie Mae comes looking for me give her this letter. If you can stay sober long enough to remember it. If you can't remember it, it's all right anyway. You ain't going to sea in that old, Corky. Hats off my lads. Old she may be but their ain't no finer vessel in the whole Pacific. Virginia and me could sail it to China or to Fiddler's Green. You might as well tell Johnnie Mae that's where we're going. What's the name of that last part? Fiddler's Green where there's plenty of credit, where's there many a lass and many a glass and never a stormy sea. We're all through long lining for the year, now we make ready for the salmon. A boat is a funny thing, Bruno. It can receive the love of a man and hold it, just like a woman. A boat lives. Be natural to stand and admire her. I think that's the way men have stood on docks all over the world, looking at the boats. They become young again. Yeah, I kinda feel that way myself. I can't figure it a few weeks ago, I didn't know one end of a boat from the other. Bruno, that was fine thing you do for Corky, lending him money enough to go to sea. How about your business, you've been along time away, it'd be pleasant to have you aboard? You'll get rid of me one of these days. One thing I already know for sure, I'm not gonna like it. Thanks mates, the service is improving around here. Where are you going, we have a lot of work to do? So have I, I've got to help a friend of a friend with some homework. Don't strain yourselves, I'll be back. Hey! Just one minute of your valuable time. Make it fast, I'm late. This is your boss you're talking to remember? You know I don't think you appreciate how lucky you are. You've got your big fists in a wonderful business and what's more you got a great guy for a pop. I wanna see you treat him a little better. What is this? You're too pretty to muss up, so don't get excited. But keep this in mind, I like your pop, you can make him happy and from now on that's the way it's gonna be understand? Just like you say, Bruno. Hi. What do you want? Schoolmates? They're a little ahead of me. Ah, Connie would you listen to me with an open mind for just one second. If I wasn't such an amateur well I, I wouldn't have started off so badly. Look, if you'll just come and have a Cappuccino with me I'd like to prove I can behave myself. And what would a Cappuccino be? Oh, it's a mixture of hot chocolate and live steam with a little dash of brandy, something like you. And you call yourself an amateur. Please, they make them right up the street. Please. You've got too many people on your side. So, this is a Cappuccino? A very special mixture. It's supposed to have magic powers. Like what? They say that people who drink them together are bound to become lifelong friends. Salute. Well, well, I didn't believe it was possible. What are you looking at? You, you can smile, with a little practice you might even learn how to laugh. I guess I never had much to laugh about. Oh, there's always something to laugh about. If you can't find anything else handy you might laugh at yourself. By golly, you take life seriously. You know, I'm not sure I want you for a lifelong friend, you might give me the willies. I'm sorry. This is a very charming place. Bruno never brought me here. I don't suppose it's elegant enough for Bruno. How is he? Oh, he's all right. Look why don't you forget about that sour apple for five minutes and unwind. Look, just think of me as a professor, a guy who's gonna teach you how to laugh. Okay, professor. Well, Carl, you don't do so good today. Went all afternoon corking two seams. You been daydreaming maybe? Oh, what you do, that's no way to treat a ship. If you don't like the way I cork your bucket, get some other guy. Carl, you've been loafing all day. You'll hurt the boat that way. Take your hands off me. Stay out of this. I've been putting this off too long. Get some water. You could have killed him. Yeah. You do not fight like a man, Bruno Felkin, you fight like a wild animal. No fights are nice, not if you're gonna win. Why did you do it? I don't know, I don't know why I did it. Thanks, Bruno Felkin. And when a farmer finishes his breakfast he monkeys around in a field. Is it drinking time yet? Nope, it's only 10 minutes past eight. You're a liar, you can't tell the time that way. You were never no Indian scout. Hey you, come here. I said come here. Your name's Ball, isn't it? Granted. Maybe you could do something for me. Well, I was just leaving in a hurry to get home. You haven't got a home. Well, I was just this minute gonna see a friend of mine that's holding a job for me. Come back here. How long since you've been locked up on a vag charge, General? - I never was- - January wasn't it, vagrancy, drunk, disorderly, disturbing the peace. You know my brother looks exactly like me. I understand you perfectly but unless you wanna spend a few more nights in the tank, you've better give me some information. Where's this fella Corky Mullins? He's gone fishing and that's natural ain't it? When will he be back? I ain't no swami. In his boat, maybe never. Have you seen his car? He ain't got no car. Oh no, what makes you so sure? Corky couldn't have, he's always broke. Even his boat's owned by a woman that's sweet on him, a regular siren. Did she buy Corky a new car? She couldn't have or I'd have known it. You find out when Corky's coming back General. I'll look you up in a day or so. Thank you very much chief. Smoke slow, General, it'll last longer. In such a hurry you can't say hello to an old friend. I'm in no hurry, just tired, wanna get home. How's the hat business? So, so, there's always the character that leaves a dime. Connie, I'm trying to figure something out that's giving me plenty of trouble. Offhand what would you estimate as the minimum time a woman can be loyal to a man? Kelsey what are you trying to do understand woman? Questions like that will get you in real trouble. You know I was kidding myself you might stick to your man. Well, I guess this is why I came in. Connie, why don't you come over on our side for awhile? The air's a lot better and we need your help. I told you until Bruno himself changes my mind, I believe in him. About this new boyfriend. What makes you think there is one? Please, I've been in this business a long time. Ask me how you did on your English test at school and I'll tell you. Why can't you meet an honest man for a change? - Who said he isn't? - I did, for one thing he's quite a liar. Kelsey when you think these things up, what do you do, hang by your knees? Oh, maybe he's just forgetful or been drinking from the fountain of youth. He bought a new car but he took out the registration of a name of a Corky Mullins who disappeared on me. That must have taken some doing. It so happens Corky Mullins is 64-years-old. Well, why come to me about it? Because if we ask your new boyfriend, we might scare him away and I've got a hunch he can be useful. See Connie, I'm still betting you're on the level. - Won't you help us? - No. Well, think it over anyway. Maybe when you hear from Bruno you'll let me know. Sure I will, calls me everyday long distance from the moon. - I'm sorry I'm late. - Who's been chasing you? Nobody, I made sure of it. Kelsey knows about you, at least that you have a car. Everybody's got a car and who's Kelsey? He's a policeman. How come you know him? Well, a friend of mine is in trouble and Kelsey thought I might know something about it. Would your friend be Bruno? This is hot and so good. You know, I'm beginning to like these more and more. I asked you a question. Yes, it's Bruno. I was afraid it might be me. I'm getting so I don't like being Bruno's collection boy. I'm going to quit everyday now. That's what Bruno always said. Carl, you told me that that car was yours. You don't have to impress me that way. It is mine. I thought a new car would make me feel big. Because I made a mistake once I can't get a license. So, I asked my friend, Corky Mullins if I could use his name for registering a car. Anyway I've done a lot of favors for him. See I am still trying to impress you. Kelsey won't stop till he finds out why your car's registered under a man's name. They can't hang me for that. But they could find out about Bruno. I couldn't care less. And then they'll find out about you. Oh, I guess it doesn't make much difference. It does to me. I like you, professor. There'd be an unhappy bird, Bruno. Nobody ever heard one sing. It'd be a funny thing nobody know where they go when they die. Nobody cared either. I think the reason for that is the seagull does nothing. They spend their whole life waiting for somebody else to provide them with a free meal. We're sure not providing any meals, we haven't caught a fish in three days. Hey Pop! This one's for you anyway. Fine fisherman you turned out to be. I bet the other boats are getting plenty. When you polished the spools this morning was any of them nicked? No, I used the brand new ones. And Bruno kept his fingers off like you said. We were both careful. No feed in them. Not so much as a shrimp or a sardine. They should be hungry. Yeah, I guess your pop be a bad fisherman this day all right. But by and by we make some kind of magic. When this happen you have plenty of time to think how you do wrong. I've been doing some thinking too. Now don't expect me to change my ideas about this lousy business. I've been waiting to say something. I was wrong to push you that day, Pop. I hope you can forgive me. Just a minute. Bruno, put on the autopilot and come here quick. So, you think the old man forget how to fish, huh? You think I don't know what happens to salmons' brains. You think I just been sitting here waiting for the fish to jump on board, asleep in my head so. - So, so. - So what? So, I have two ignoramuses for a crew. So, one day in the shipyard I tell them to grease the propellor shaft bearings and they are so busy knocking each other's blockheads off, they forget to do like I tell them. So, the propellor turned and the shaft goes squeak, squeak and the fish runaway to other parts of the ocean. And they said Hamil Linder be a fool and they be right. Hello Hamill. It's fine night but I still got a hunch it's gonna blow. Yeah, Carl thinks so too. You may not believe this but Carl have come to be a fine fisherman. Why shouldn't I believe it? Well, people sometime get the wrong idea. How's about the other guy, where did he come from anyway? I don't ask him anymore than you would, so long as he like the sea, that'd be enough. What's the matter with you? You are more nervous than some old woman? Well, well, I have to think some things out and I don't get anywhere at all. You know I am not the Catholic Barney. So, what, lots of people ain't Catholics. They ain't gonna get the religion on me. No, be much too late for that I guess. But there are some things to be said, things I have to say that would be much clearer if I come right out and say them. You not making no sense. What are you talking about? Well, Barney Schriona if you please, I would like to use your chapel for a little while. Go right ahead, no charge. Not being a Catholic like I say, I'm not sure how to begin. I could take you to the devotions step by step. But I have a hunch some other time would be better. Go right in there and run your own show. You sure this be all right? Why not, us Catholics don't own God. Thanks, Barney. Sir, it has to be said that I lost my son, Carl a longtime ago. And if there be some chance to get him back, I would like to do this. Now this day it so happened my son was close to me, closer than he was since he was a small boy. So he was like he was the time his mother lived. Make a wonderful feeling for both of us. Sir, I'd like to keep this feeling and I'd be afraid every minute I'd do something to drive it away, 'cause I am the father and I must teach him and I must love him but I must never be weak, always strong. So, because what reason is there for my living if I cannot do this one thing. Sir, I think you will understand all this, even if I don't say it just right, because you were the father. - Is this your car? - Yeah. Something's a matter? No, just a couple of boards are stuck. - Okay, then cast off now. - With you in a minute. Who's that guy on the dock? I don't know some joker. - What did he want? - Want? Yeah, what did he want? I guess he was just trying to sell me some insurance. Insurance. Yeah, what about it, what are you so head up about it? What kind of insurance? For my car, anything wrong with that? Oh I guess I forgot to tell you I bought one. I guess you did. How did you manage to get a car? I paid for it with money I got from minding your racket. How could you register a car when you're on probation? It's in Corky Mullin's name no one has to know. Then how come this guy tried to sell you insurance? He said he always keeps his eyes open for drivers of new cars, it's smart business. Yeah, you bet it's smart. So, this guy just walks up to you a big shot prospect with a flashy car, only you don't tell him the car don't belong to you. What difference does it make? Have you heard from Connie? What's Connie got to do with it? I've been taking her out a little. I like her and I think she likes me. You've been taking her out in that car? Yeah. That's just great. You ever look back and see how many squad cars are following you? This salesman, did he ask you many questions? No, he just said he's around the wharf quite a bit - and he- - What did he say - his name was? - He didn't say. You think I'm gonna fall for that? It so happens your insurance friend is a cop. What makes you think so? I don't think so, I know so. Now you listen to me, the last guy who tried to outsmart Felkin isn't around anymore. I wouldn't wanna see that happen to you, understand? You think this fog is gonna hold us up? No, I think maybe it get clear as we get closer in. Oh, good, I got business in port. You never leave the boat before. I think maybe you in some kind of trouble. No, I've never been in any trouble, except that I could have used a pop like you a long time ago. Not so long ago. It just you look older than you be. Your mouth twists sometimes like a man who be afraid to say the wrong thing. Be fighting all the time. Who isn't? If you don't fight the world walks all over you. Look at you, you fight the fish by, as the weather, so what difference does it make? I can win, Bruno Felkin, so I am not afraid. That be how I tried to teach Carl. He would not say inside himself that it'd be a fine thing to be a fisherman. He think to work by his hands is something to be ashamed about. Maybe Carl be right except that I do not feel ashamed, I never do. - Hey. - Get the boat hook. Why'd we slow down for, Pop? Corky, where'd he get the money to get to sea? Bruno tried to help him. Been in the water a long time. He picked this place, he said for you to wait. I'll be up the road a little if you need me. Oh, what you do to me. Oh, you're so thin. I found out what it's like to work for a living. You look wonderful. Your skin. The moment Carl told me I was gonna see you, I had dizzy spells. I'm still whirly. I guess I was afraid. - Why? - I don't know. I'm not sure of anything lately. When are you coming back? Never. Why Bruno? Once you said we needed each other. Since you left, I'm not sure if you ever needed anyone. The whole world isn't against you. Yes, it is. I'm not. You and a guy named Hamil Linder. Someday when we're traveling first class on a boat going to South America I'll tell you all about it. Meantime what we have to do isn't gonna be easy for either one of us. Because of Marty Prince. What have they told you? Oh Bruno, I begged you not to carry a gun. As long as I had to make a mistake in business, I'm glad it was him. Now I'll need your help. Tomorrow's gonna be our busy day. I'll do almost anything to help you. Cut out the almost, doesn't sound like you. First thing tomorrow you go to Marty Prince Enterprises, get some of their letterheads. I don't care what you tell them but get them. And bring them to me tomorrow night at 10 o'clock. I'll be at the north end of pier 43. Oh, Bruno I don't like this. - You better like it. - But I don't think- Oh shut up. Don't you think, let me genius the brain huh. I'm looking forward to the time when we can do things right, just now we haven't got it. Make sure you're alone tomorrow. You looking for somebody. Right on time, I knew you would be. You're doing a great job, baby. Here are the papers you wanted. Yeah, yeah, these will really spot me. Now a few more details and we're all set. Now, I'll be sailing tonight. On Thursday call Sutta 12020, ask for homicide. Say you're a friend of Marty Prince's, say you know who gave it to Marty see. And if they'll cover a new Ford parked behind Union Hall, wait till the driver shows up. They'll have who they're looking for. Bruno what are you doing? Police hold their job because they have good conviction records and I'm gonna help them. But you can find another way, leave the country- Only tin horns try to run faster than a teletype machine. - Bruno- - While they wind up places like Alcatraz. I won't do it. Yes, you will. Sure you will. We can have a real life together. I'm trusting you with my life. Quick, beat it, these guys talk too much. Bruno, Bruno! So, what, 59 degrees. Now that'd be very fine, albacore like that. You know albacore be the fastest fish in the ocean. They swim 30, 40 mile an hour and when they hit they hit hard. By and by I think that something, there you go. Easy now, easy. There they go set those barbs. Any slack, you lose him. Hard and even. Put your back into it. Easy now, easy now. First one of the season. You do a fine job son. I got one, Pop, look I got two! Another one, son. We're in it, Pop, we're in it! Now circle the spool, get them boys. We find them by golly. I try to call Barney and tell him. It's those seventh waves that gets you. Stand by or capsized. What do you mean seventh wave? Watch, every seven minutes a whopper comes along. It just turns out to be about every seven. Don't ask me why. One moved me on the beach when I was a kid, I never wanted any part of swimming since. Hey Bruno, wanna buy a new car? - Yours? - Yeah. I decided it's too fancy for a fisherman. I thought you weren't gonna be one? After knowing you I'm considering a lot of changes. For one thing, you're getting off this boat and I'm sticking with Pop for awhile. Are you giving orders? When we hit port, I'm giving you two hours to disappear. I'm only giving you on account of Connie and Pop. It won't do any good to make her feel sick. What's this with you and Connie? I wanna marry her. What would your pop think of that? If I stay with him, he'll be happy. Remember two hours after he gets back to port. Hey, you two gossiping old ladies, slow down hauling in the fish just because we get a little wind. Those fish won't wait around all day! Gone after awhile. Relax, we'll sink the boat for you! How far do you think we're offshore? Search me, too far, we won't sleep tonight. I guess nothing can happen, huh? What's the matter, you afraid to die? Hey Bruno, give me a hand here will you? This hatch can cover fish just like a. That oughta hold, I hope. How you like this Bruno? I don't. This be the travel for the Pacific coast. Not enough harbors. Other way 12 hours from here. San Francisco the same about. Farallon lslands be no good in this wind. New Year's Island be no good either. So, we have to ride things out. This place is jumping tonight, isn't it? How about a brandy, Neil? My favorite brandy. I don't suppose you could stick by the rules and wait till after we close. I need it now. I've stood behind bars a long time. You can get a free case of champagne for telling me something I haven't heard before. Now when did he mistreat you? He never did. Then what's the other woman like? There never was one. If I do a little weeping, Neil it's because I owe one man a great deal for showing me the kind of life I didn't want. Would you be surprised to tell you what I really want is a home and children? On one half of one drink, yes. In a lot of ways he was so wonderful. He always used to say to me, "Connie, you've gotta be" the very tops, be all rich inside and walk proud." So? So, that's what I'm gonna do. Even though I don't feel proud, he would want me to. - All alone? - I hope not. You sent for me? What made you think I'd know where Bruno was? You're a patient man, lieutenant. I have to be. Remember how I hate to write things down. You don't have to write this down. I've decided to move over to your side. I couldn't help that one, Pop. They seem to be getting bigger. Nevermind boy, you're doing a fine job. You think the wind is dropping away, Pop? By and by maybe. You must be tired, Carl, take some rest. Nothing doing, Pop, if I get a chance to take it, I'll get scared. It's easier to let you do the worrying. I'm not worried. Worried about the V for the W, it's worried. But you just relax and do it with any accent you like. We'll all feel better. I have this to say, Bruno and it maybe we go for a spin, I think you should know it. I have to say that you are a fine fella. What all of a sudden gave you that idea? You be gallant, Carl is with me again. I had nothing to do with that. So you say. I would like to have you for a son too, Bruno, for as long as you care to be. Oh, well Pop you wouldn't want me for a son. Bruno, outside quick! We take a big one! Boat's coming avail we take on a ton of water! We've got to get one in fast, here's some nails. Is the best hammer you can find? Pop said to hurry. We're really catching it now. Looks like we've really had it! Hurry the boat can catch up if we get this canvas down right! You really think we can get out of this? I've gotta think that way! You were so right, this is no way to make a living. Watch out Bruno! Carl, he never swim, my boy! Steady, Bruno, I make it lean! I'll throw you another line! Oh, ho, hello, sit down. Have some tea. Why'd you ask me to come up here? Oh, it eases my official conscience, and this is a peaceful place. I suppose that's what we're all looking for. Have you ever had a Chinese fortune cake? I don't think so. They always have a bit of literature inside. Try yours, it might be interesting. The next moon will bring you love. Could be. I had a call from the Coast Guard this morning. A boat named the Taaga lost a man overboard. A fellow who was really two people. It's funny how many different kinds of wild animals there are isn't it? Thanks for telling me this way. Thanks Lieutenant Kelsey. Well, Barney, I see you be loafing again. You cut that hold with a knife just so you could stay in port. You going to a wedding or something? Maybe by and by. Today be very important by golly. Today I swallow the anchor. You mean, you're gonna quit for the season with all them fish out there. I quit forever. I be like a boat, Barney, I make long sail and finally come to port. I be tired, Barney. Everybody in this business is tired but even you ain't so crazy as to quit fishing. What would you do with yourself? Maybe I go to the mountains for awhile. Ah, you oughta be ahead, why the second day you'd be down by some stream trying to catch a trout. Yeah, that's just what I'll do. I'd sit by the stream all day and think how lucky I am. So what happens to the Taaga while you're doping off? - Oh, I sell it. - You what? Carl, he buy it. Of course, he be short of cash but he work hard, make up by and by. What given such a change of heart? Bruno do a lot to change Carl's mind and that girl, she has lots of spirit by golly. She order all the food for Carl and help him with his fishing plans. You know, Barney, I lose a man at sea. I do not forgive myself for that but it's wonderful to think that because of him, I find another man. Take care of things on shore for me, will you Pop? Good fishing, Carl, I wrapped a bread double for you, it'll keep at least a week. Thanks Connie.
