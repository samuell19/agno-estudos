Filmed in 1932 by Harry Lachman, The Beautiful Sailor was considered lost for over 80 years. In 2016 a copy emerged from the UCLA Film and Television Archive in the USA. Unfortunately, the copy was incomplete, containing only 5 out of 9 reels. A few photographs along with a commentary inspired by the play of Marcel Achard compensate for the lack of missing reels 1, 4, 6 and 7. The Beautiful Sailor From North to East, there wasn't a sailor who hadn't heard of Cormoran. It's a solid little barge with crew consisting of captain Pierre, his younger sister Mique, who never knew any other life except that on board, and Sylvestre, the sailor with whom Mique was unrequitedly in love. Mique spends her time between taking care of the barge and preparing the horses for barge towing. Pierre and Sylvestre make sure the barge runs smoothly with a sense of fraternity only cemented by a long time collaboration. One day, while waiting on the lock, Sylvestre receives a letter. He is going to be absent for two weeks due to family reasons. Shortly afterwards, they hear cries for help. A young lady is drowning. Pierre dives into the water and manages to bring the poor woman ashore. "Where am I?", she asks. "On safe ground", he responds, "but beware of dry drowning. You can change your clothes on the barge". I'm on vacation. My father runs a small bistro in Paris. So you're from Paris! It feels nice to freshen up. Need any help? No, no, I'm fine, thank you. What a pity! A rat! A rat! I beg your pardon, want me to kill it? Oh, no, no! Please go away, I'll manage. Suit yourself. Here I am! - My sister's dress doesn't look bad on you after all. - Really? And what's this? It's a sextant. It's used to determine the ship's position by calculating the exact longitude and latitude. And you need one here? Well, not on the barge, no. Let me explain. You see, one day I'll be sailing the seas. I'm not going to to spend my whole life in the canals. So I need to study. - Here you can see... - And what do you measure with this? No, that's a music instrument. And here you can see... - This is my friend Sylvestre. - You know how to play this? Don't you want to see my friend Sylvestre? Do you fancy him? - He's cute. - Oh yeah? Especially his eyes, they're marvelous. Ah, here comes Mique! Let me introduce my sister. Pleased to meet you. - You find my dress pretty, don't you? - Oh yes, let me explain. The poor lady fell into the water and I rescued her. She was cold so I gave her your dress. - It's only natural. - Precisely the word I was looking for. And what's the lady's name? - Well... funny... but I don't know. - Marinette Broquet. Marinette? A pretty name! I prefer Broquet. - Your sister is very sweet. - She is. - I was thinking... - What? Since you have to return to Paris, it would be great if you could join us. - Eh, Mique? - Good idea. Cormoran Ship's Log Longitude 4°55 East Latitude 45° North I saved Miss Broquet. She will accompany us to Paris. - Do you like our ways? - Oh, yes. It's better than being trapped in a café all day. Can't argue with that. - Why do you ask? - Well, you know... There must be some reason. - Well, I wanted to... - I'm listening... Well, since you like it here, I figured... maybe you could come and live with us for good. What do you mean? The four of us would make a nice family. Then I would have to become a member of the family first. That's exactly what I had in mind. - I'm not sure... - Do you find my proposition annoying? Which proposition? Well... to marry me. - Tombouctou, what would you do in my place? - Ha, he said yes! You should thank him then. If you only knew how happy I am right now, how delighted... You're the one for me! And to think that Sylvestre told me not to mess up... Well, if this is messing up for you, why bother... That's not what I meant, it's just that I'm happier than you can imagine. Here! The priest was hilarious! Yeah, he stammers. And when he said: "You're ma... ma..." What did he say? He was trying to say "you are married". And he did, but only later. - Tell me, father... - What? - I believe she loves me. - Who, Marinette? Ask her! But I'm asking you! You fool! She hasn't shed a tear. If a day passes without her crying she must be over the moon. Sorry, dad, but I want to talk to my husband for a second. Satisfied? Beyond words. Would happy be the right word? Not quite. - So you prefer me over your boat? - I do. And even over your irreplaceable Sylvestre? Well, that's something different. By the way, I wonder what he's up to. He must have missed his train. Ah, here he comes! Long live the bride! Long live the bride! Hey folks, long live the bride! What's going on? - Is father Estel here? - No, my friend. - And what about his daughter? - No, no. Neither is his son, I assume. No, they're not here. But he should have come to the wedding. - No, not his son. - Oh, I don't care about his son. - Poor uncle Etienne has died. - Oh... Oh, that's too bad. Such a pity. - Well, what do I do now? - Have some cheese. - Here. - My name is Valentin. Valentin, father Estel's nephew. That's how... Sorry, thank you. You can't have any fun in Pont-à-Mousson. Because I serve in the army in Pont-à-Mousson. But at your wedding party, we're going to have a laugh. We're going to have fun, get it? That's me. I broke my neck to get a leave, spent the whole night on the train and even torn my pants on the train seat. Next thing I know, I'm at the wedding surrounded by unknown people. Well let's get to know each other then. You can sit there. - No, no, that's reserved for Sylvestre. Better sit here. Tell us about the army. If you can't think of anything more interesting we'd better change the subject 'cause it's pointless! I was at Pont-à-Mousson too. I beg you, let's not talk about Pont-à-Mousson. Seems to me it's not going to be easy to find a common topic with you. Let's sing or play some games then. Here, my friend, take this cake, do whatever you please and we'll try to have fun our own way. Long live the bride! Anyway, allow me to say that the bride is beautiful. The bride is truly beautiful. This would make them laugh in Pont-à-Mousson. I thought we were done talking about Pont-à-Mousson. Well, you haven't come up with a better topic so far. Tell me, my friend, where is Cormoran? Cormoran? What's wrong with you? There's no Cormoran anymore. What do you mean there's no Cormoran? Has it sunk? No, now it's called The Beautiful Sailor. The Beautiful Sailor? What kind of name is that? But she surely is beautiful. Who is beautiful? The captain's wife. Captain's wife? He's got married? You can't leave him for five minutes... Hasn't he told you? I didn't have a clue. When was the wedding? Today, look at my cravat. We've been celebrating on all boats. - Bye, old boy, see you around. - Bye bye. I'll have a sip. Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends... I would like to show you a little trick which you've never seen before. I will need a glass. An empty one. And a jug. Now I'm going to put the jug onto the glass, take a fork, a cork and another fork and put it all on the jug. Then I'm going to take a clean towel, put it on the top... - Is he a friend of your father's? - Look, look! ...and pull out the glass so that nothing falls. - Nothing? - Nothing. - Nothing at all? - Nothing at all. I'll count to three. Attention everybody! That's strange, it worked back in Pont-à-Mousson. - I'm going to try again! - Oh, please don't! Here comes Sylvestre! My dear Sylvestre! - Looking great, my friend! - You too. - What about me? - Hello, little Mique. What's going on here, is it July 14 again? No, but a lot has happened since you left. So I've been told. Come, I want you to meet the bride. My friend, let me introduce Marinette to you. My my! Eh? - You're speechless, eh? - That's the word. - I see I made quite an impression. - So it seems. Glad to hear that, especially because Pierre cares about your opinion a lot. - You speak as if you knew me. - But I do. The captain here told me stories about you. May I ask you for a favour? Tell him that you find me pretty, only then I'll be sure. Wasn't it obvious from his reaction? Then it's settled. So... Well, what are you waiting for? What do you mean? Kiss her, she's your sister now. May I? Yes, your sister. Let us celebrate with a glass of champagne. We've been dancing on the same spot for an hour now, a few steps here and there wouldn't do us any harm. Are you coming? Sylvestre! Aren't you going to dance with me? Yes, of course... No, I think you ought to dance with the bride first. He's a great dancer, you know. Is there anything you're not good at? Because according to him, you're so perfect that it's scary. Does it scare you? I'm anxious to dance with this wonderboy. Then we'll see... You've hurt me! That's because of the buckles. I'm the best dancer in Pont-à-Mousson. Sylvestre, how about that dance now? Sorry, little Mique, but I'm dancing with the bride. Are you familiar with modern dances too? But of course! This calls for a celebration. All the sailors from the Seine are organising a celebration in your honour! He's as drunk as a lord. What a weeding, captain, what a wedding! There wouldn't even be a wedding if she hadn't acted foolish. - Oh, come on! - I didn't mean it. Without acting foolish I would still be stuck in Pont-à-Mousson. I'm so happy to have you both by my side. There they go with their friendship again! I used to have a good friend called Chaussin. Quite a big fellow, funny too, but we've fallen out eventually. - Was it because of a woman? - Oh, no, because of a bicycle. Tell me something sweet! Look! After the wedding, life continues peacefully on The Beautiful Sailor. Marinette enjoys all the privileges of a captain's wife, Sylvestre enjoys everyone's fondness, while Mique remains trapped in her everyday routines. There's always something to do on board, but they also have their moments of fun whenever the boat anchors in a magic place. It's really wonderful! - And it feels so nice. - Yes. Oh, Sylvestre and his follies... It was quite amusing. And where is he now? With the captain, changing his clothes on the boat. - Why are you looking at me like that? - I'm not. I've never seen a woman doing that before. What, putting makeup? All women do that. At least those who want to be noticed. Do you want to try it? - Oh, no. - But why? - Don't you want to be noticed? - I do. Come then, let's try it. We'll put some lipstick first... There you go... Now I'll put some here... Oh, it was fantastic, right? The wind was favourable. What's with your hair? Let me fix it for you. What have you done, Mique? Let me fix it. - Leave me alone! - But I only want to help you! I don't know what's wrong with her. Mique doesn't look herself with a lipstick on. What's wrong, Sylvestre? You're not afraid of me, are you? Of course I'm not, Marinette. Hello, Sylvestre! How long has it been since you left Paris? Two weeks... And it took you two weeks just to get here? That's how it goes with a woman on board. How come? - Everybody's giving orders. - But you've got someone by your side. - What do you mean? - Little Mique always supports you. - When are you marrying her? - That's out of the question. Such a pity, she's so kind. Why don't you take her out for a dance tonight? There's a party just around the corner. I know what I'm doing. That's out of tune. - Where's that music coming from? - There's a party across the street. (inaudible dialogue) But I've got a cold. You're like a magnet for colds. Why are you moving your shoulders like that? Eh? What's wrong with my shoulders? You're walking like this. - I've never noticed it. - See? Please, let's go out, I'm so fed up with this place! But we can dance here... Oh, please, I can't stand this music! Let's go out! I have work to do, maybe Sylvestre can go. Take her out for a dance. Well... If that's what she wants... gladly. Let's go then. Are you coming with us, Mique? No, I'll pass. On second thought... why not! - Are you coming later? - Yes, as soon as I finish. - See you then. - See you. - It's so lively in here. - Yes, very amusing. (inaudible dialogue) What will you have? (inaudible dialogue) - A whiskey for me. - Very well. Shall we? - You're quite a dancer! - I love it, but don't have time for it. I see. - I used to dance a lot in Montmartre. - Oh, such a lovely place Montmartre! - Have you heard of "The Green Devil"? - Of course I have. - I've never seen you there. - It was before I got into sailing. We have a thing in common, we both love Paris. Absolutely! - We're friends, aren't we, Sylvestre? - Of course, Marinette. Then why are you constantly avoiding me? I'm not, Marinette. Then why did you hesitate to take me out dancing? I didn't want him to work all by himself. Tell me about the captain! He always talks about his Sylvestre. As if you were something special! But you're far from it, aren't you? If I were so perfect, I wouldn't be here. You're not such a bad dancer after all... It feels nice to go out, don't you agree, Mique? Thank you. Aren't you going to ask me for a dance? Well, if you like... - May I, Marinette? - Go ahead. Hi, Sylvestre! Told you so. Have you told him as well that you're in love with me? - No, I haven't told anyone. - That's a good one. Baudiniere in Dunkerk, Lurette in Dole, Delor in Conflans, whole France knows that you're in love with me. - But there's nothing shameful in that! - Oh, there's nothing shameful in that. Anyway if you're refusing me because of Marinette, you're making a big mistake. - What did you say? She doesn't care about you, she loves my brother. Mind your words! I'm jealous. - That doesn't give you the right to act like that. - Will you forgive me? - I forgive you, but this isn't the first time you've spoken rashly about your feelings. - And what if someone heard you? - You mean Marinette, right? That's enough now, you're getting on my nerves! No, no, I don't want to dance with you! - Well, look at the ice queen! - At least I'm not ugly! - Why you... - Leave me alone! Oh Sylvestre, you know... What? Why didn't she want to dance with me? A chick like any other. Hey, cut it out! Let's go outside then! If that's what you want... Let me go! Let me go! Leave him alone. He can take care of himself. What's the matter, are you crying? Don't tell me you're afraid. No, not at all. He's just made a scene because of you! He's in love with you, there's no denying it. It's clear to me, especially after what's just happened. Maybe you're right... You've noticed it too? Yes, I believe he's in love with me. What, has he told you? No, no, no, I mean... The signs are obvious. Hush now! Look, here comes Sylvestre! And? I taught them a lesson. Come on, it's time to go back. You go, Marinette. I'll catch up with you as soon as I pay. Waiter! The captain was right about Sylvestre. He really is something! I beg you don't say a word to Pierre! Oh, there you are! I was just about to look for you. - And Sylvestre? - He's coming. What's the matter, have you been crying? Oh, I see, you've been fighting again... Not a big deal, just a squabble. Marinette and I have arguments too, but that doesn't prevent us from loving each other, right Marino? - What's wrong, are you angry? - It's nothing. It's so hot! It's even worse in the cabin. Would you prefer to sleep here, Sylvestre? Why not, Marinette, I'm quite used to it. To sleep here with this storm in the air? I bet it's going to rain in less than an hour. Trust a sailor! You're welcome to take the cabin then. I'll stay here 'cause I'm anxious to see your faces when the rain starts. Sylvestre! - Sylvestre! - Eh? Come over, it's better here. There's more fresh air. Thank you, my little Mique, I'm good. Sylvestre! - Sylvestre! - Leave him alone for God's sake! With every passing day, Marinette hovers more around Sylvestre like a butterfly. Unable to bare it anymore, Mique decides to let Pierre know. One evening, while alone with her brother, Mique unveils the truth: "I have to tell you something serious. It has to do with your happiness and honour. Please, keep an eye on Marinette. You'll notice that she's showing more affection for Sylvestre than a married woman should." Pierre isn't convinced. When Marinette joins him, he takes the opportunity to question her. "It seems that you and Sylvestre get along quite well..." "Indeed", answers Marinette. "He showers me with attention. Now you know." "But that's impossible", replies Pierre. "Sylvestre is above any suspicion, you must be mistaken!" Despite the confidence he has in his friend, the seed of doubt begins to sprout within Pierre. It's true that Sylvestre has looked quite absent lately. On the very next day, while Sylvestre was leading Tombouctou for barge towing, he didn't notice a big hole where the horse injured his paw. Enjoying the conversation? - Yes, why? - Just asking. Sorry to disturb you, but I need to talk to you about Tombouctou. - I'm listening. - The poor animal can't take it anymore. And it's all your fault! You were the one leading him when the accident happened. - You think you could do any better? - Certainly, because I know my job! And I don't? - With such a wind, I would have shortened the rope. - Which I did. But not enough! If you had done your job properly, this would have never happened. - But mister is playing Romeo instead. - Romeo? You'll need a prettier face for such a role. Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's the matter, my sister isn't enough so now you want my wife too?! What's that supposed to mean, Pierre?! We both know you'll regret your words within an hour. - What's the matter, need someone to take your side? - What did you say?! You'll never make a good sailor. Now you're really starting to annoy me, got it? I'm annoying an idiot who can't even calculate the wind properly! And I figure you're going to teach me, right? Sure I am, but that's not the point. All I'm saying is, if you had been doing your job, my horse would still be fine. Take your word back! It's over between us, but take it back! You're the one who's guilty for my horse. I won't tolerate this much longer! Take back what you've said! - No! You've just thrown away a ten-year-long friendship. I'll leave all right, but not before you apologise! Come on, you can't be serious. - Step aside, Marinette. - Leave me alone! Apologise, Pierre! Apologise or brace yourself! You think I'm afraid of you? Sylvestre! Does it hurt? You should have thought twice before accusing me! Enough already! Why, because I fell into the water? No, friends can fight each other in anger but not in cold blood. - I'm not cold blooded! - Cut it out! - Goodbye, Pierre! - You're leaving? - Yes. Remember what you said? That friends are forever, but obviously they're not! Goodbye! Are you really going to leave like this? Goodbye Marinette, I don't blame you for anything. And your stuff? You can leave them at the first lock. Your friend is leaving, please do something! Maybe it's for the best. - It's all my fault! - Damn right it is! - But he mustn't leave! - It's for the best, I've already told you. Sylvestre! Sylvestre! Tombouctou is ill. It's been three months since Sylvestre parted. I'm asking him to return, for the sake of M... Mique. Dear Sylvestre, Please come back for the sake of the captain. Dear Sylvestre, please come back for the sake of Mique and your friend, the captain. Hey, Sylvestre, won't you come over to give us a hand? You need to pick up your new job. Enes! - Enes! - What? - Come here! Go back to the vet and tell him that I want to meet him tonight. And when am I going to eat? You'll eat as soon as you finish the job. - All right then... - Make sure he takes good care of the horse! I don't care for the price, as long as he saves Tombouctou. Then we'll go to some bistro. Come back with the news before the night falls. But you've promised to take me out tonight. Oh, I forgot about that... - You'll find me in the café then. - Aye. Get going! I should go too. Yes, you should. Well, any news on Tombouctou? The vet has sent you this note. Miss Mique is still there weeping. - That's it. - Is he dead? No, but we should go there now. The vet sent for me so I should be off. - I was thinking, maybe... - No, no, come with me, we'll have to find another horse. Sylvestre! Well, well! Isn't it Sylvestre! - Marinette... - Hello! What a surprise, my friend. What brings you here? I'm working on Felicite, at a stone's throw from here. - Oh, yeah? - And until when? - We're leaving tomorrow morning. - So do we! Sorry, I should be going, the vet is waiting for me. - Why? Is it Tombouctou? - Yes... It's been three months since you went away... He has been limping so we have to put him to sleep. - No way... - Unfortunately. Will you still be around when we return? I'm afraid I can't stay long, my boss is going out. - Will you go back to the boat? There's no one there. - Yes. Tell me, how about coming back for good? - Well, that depends on you too. - When do you finish there? - You mean on Felicite? - Yes. In a fortnight. I'll explain next time since you're in a hurry. Ok then, see you soon. You should come back, you really should! I would like to... But after what happened... - After all, you're free. - Yes, in a fortnight. Afterwards I'll be free to leave Felicite. Well, in that case... It was very cruel of you to leave like that, Sylvestre. - Forget about it. - While you were away... And to think that we were all so close... Everything's changed, even our marriage... I've had a hard time too, Marinette. - Mique and Pierre were talking about you all the time. - Really? Mique even said that you were in love with me... - Poor thing. - She also said... You won't believe it... - She said that you were staring at my legs. - Me? What a silly thought! - That's too much! - I agree. - How stupid it is to be jealous. - Indeed. It's even worse 'cause you hate me now, don't you? I did believe it at first until I realised it wasn't true. I've been thinking a lot about you, Sylvestre. You've been on my mind too, Marinette. So, friends? Friends. - Please don't, Marinette. - But why not? I've been thinking about you for the last three months, but only as a friend. - Even better. - Even better? - Yes, even better for me too. Please don't, Marinette. We really shouldn't... I'd better leave now. As you wish... Just think about Pierre. - I do. Think about Mique. - I do. No, Marinette, I really have to go. Listen... Farewell then, we're not going to see each other again. Could we at least kiss for goodbye? I guess we could. - Oh, how I love you! - I love you! - I love you! - My dear! - Oh, my dear! - I don't want to leave you ever again! - Neither do I, Marinette... - Are you coming back? - You mean here? - Oh, no, that's not possible. - Sylvestre! We can't go on living this way, we can't keep hiding forever. You're right, no more lies! There's only one option left, I'm going to tell the truth to Pierre! Sylvestre! I'm so glad you're back! - Good evening, my little Mique. - You're back, my old chap! We're through with Tombouctou. This wouldn't have happened if you had stayed with Mique... - Pierre, I wanted to... - You're not going away again, are you? - I wanted to... - Stay with us! - We need to have a word in private. Excuse us for a second, Marinette. Let's go. - You see, Pierre... - Don't tell me you're leaving again. If it's because of Marinette, I'll take care of it. - No, Pierre, listen... - No, you listen, all our disputes are a thing of the past. You can't even imagine how Mique, Marinette and I felt while you were away. - No, no, Pierre, listen to me... - There's no need to talk, my friend, everything's settled. But, but... there's something... No more buts, Sylvestre, forget about everything! You're going to stay with us. - Don't you agree, Marinette? - Of course, of course I do! It's all settled then. Come back as soon as you finish your duties on the other boat. No, listen, listen... Oh, it's no use... We can discuss it tomorrow if you want. We weren't happy together. When you come back in the morning, I'll be gone with Sylvestre. Marinette Look, it's Sylvestre! Marinette, come out to say goodbye to Sylvestre! So, Sylvestre, in two weeks, right? - What? - In two weeks, right? - Yes, yes... - Hurry up, Marinette! Well then... see you soon. Goodbye! Farewell, Pierre... Sylvestre! Goodbye, Sylvestre! THE END
