[ Wind howling ] Ahhhhh! Will you guys quit screwing around? Come on, knock it off. Yeah? Well, you tell him to lay off me. He's crazy. All I said was it sure would be groovy if they hadn't killed off all the buffalo. - Go on, get on the truck, will ya? - He's crazy! He should have been born 100 years ago when we needed him. You'd have been great attacking some fort. You're mad now, running buck, but I'll tell you what: I want you to say your name 10 times as fast as you can. [ Dog barking ] Running buck, going to town tonight? You, Johnnie? You bust your backs all week so you can drive 40 miles, get drunk, spend all your money, turn around, come back, start all over again. It won't always be like this. Once the lake's in, we'll be rich. And the buffalo and the wild horses will return and everything'll be as it was before the white man came. What the hell is that? [ Rock music playing ] Indians! - Don't worry! - Huh? They only attack wagon trains! Oh! Ha ha!

Now I told you: Stay away from the bikes. Man: Hey, did you see the houses these people live in? So? So nothing, man. They really stink. These Indians have got it bad. I mean, they're real losers. I don't know. They did all right against custer. [ Motors humming ] Didn't I tell you to stay away from the motorcycle? What do you guys do? We Rob banks. No, I mean really. We ride our motorcycles. That's what we do. Yeah, I know. But don't you do nothing else? Don't you work or nothing? Look, shouldn't you be out practicing your bow and arrow or something? What took you so long? The guy in the station was hiding from me in the ladies' John! Neat, huh? Think maybe I could ask one of them for a ride? - You say away from 'em. - Why? Because I said so. Go on home and help Maria with the supper, hmm? - She's not there. - Where is she? She said as long as you were probably going to town anyway, you might as well eat there. - Where are you supposed to eat? - I already ate. Just keep away from 'em. All right, boys, let's line up. Come on. Let's get in line; It's pay day. Line it up. Now we can't have you all inside at once. Now if you'll line up and come in one at a time, Mr. Seely will pay you. You got me? Huh? [ Crowd chattering ] Come on. Now. Now down! Down... Come on down! [ All cheer ] Hey, kisum, I just found me a little Indian maid. Take a look at him, baby. Now now, isn't she nice? Hold onto her, man. She's okay. Keep her; We'll pass her around a little bit. Watch out for them feathers, man-- them secret ones. They'll kill you! Hey, man. What's going on? Where's the party? You got some beer, man? Here, take mine, man. All right. Hold onto yourself. - Hey! - What's the matter with you, huh? What are you trying to do with this guy over here? [ Engines revving ] Hey, kisum! How? I know how, man. The question is who. Kisum, this is my new righteous old lady, squaw. - Is that right? - Oh yeah, man. She's gonna show US an out-of-sight place to camp tonight all because she loves me so much. What about her, man? She coming too? Man, she's out to lunch. [ All laughing, shouting ] What the hell do you think you're doing? That was Mr. Fillmore's trophy. Are you crazy or something? Crazy? You call me crazy? [ All laughing, whistling ] Man: Get him, boy. Get him! Come on, man, dance! Come on, man! [ Cheering continues ] Taxes, transportation, grocery bill, comes to $42.38. That leaves you with $17.62. Sign here. Look, seely, something's got to be done. They've already taken off with one of my waitresses. There won't be anything left of that place. - And what do you suggest? - Call the sheriff. What are you waiting for? I just thought if you were going to call the sheriff, I might hang around and watch. Well, we're not calling the sheriff. Sheriff, hell. I could clean that place in five minutes. Well, Fillmore'll be back soon enough. He'll tell you what to do. You get back in there where you belong. Go on! Johnnie blue eyes. Taxes, transportation, grocery bill: $34.98, plus $19 for tractor repairs. - Hey, wait a minute. - $53.98-- that leaves you with $6.02. - Sign here. - Look, I'm not paying for that busted blade. Employer/employee contract signed last year, section 2, paragraph 4: "Employee will be subject to cost for any repairs." Now look! I want my $25. Ha! You're always causing trouble, aren't you? You can take your $6 or you can take it up with Fillmore. I really don't care which. - Where's Fillmore? - He isn't here. I'll bet! We got enough problems without starting an uprising. Running buck. Oh, wow, this-- this oatmeal, this is the most beautiful oatmeal - I have ever seen. - Thank you. It's beautiful-- you don't know how beautiful. Hey, come here for a second. Come here, I just want-- I want to tell-- come here. I want to tell you something. Come here. Hey, let's go make love. - What's wrong? - Come on. What's the matter? I said I liked your oatmeal. Hey, joint. - Hey, kisum. - How are you? Come here. What's the problem, huh? Me and this here young lady, we are going into the back and... Ha ha ha. Hey, joint? - Joint? - Yeah, man? Do you know that this is desert country, man? What? I mean, things dry out here pretty fast. Oh... oh, yeah. You should have seen when-- when I was watering my plant, it was like-- that's what I'm talking about. - You sure you gave it enough? - Yeah, I think I did. I sure hate to think the way that sun is boiling, you know? That just the lack of a glass of water, you know? Well, uh, you really think so, huh? I don't know, it's your box. Yeah, you're right. You're right. All right, listen, I'm gonna go. Everybody is-- is everybody. I'll be back. Thank you. For what? I happen to be hungry and I needed a waitress. I suppose you want a beer. You suppose wrong; I want an omelet. Well, that really makes you different than the rest. Don't count on it. [ Baby crying ] Where's Fillmore? Hey, man, like you're rude. Like I get ruder. Have you seen him? No, I haven't. Hey, Tonto, where'd you get those blue eyes? Stick around, kemosabe. I'll be back. No, honey, you don't want to get into a fight. Gotta be crazy. Is he crazy? Where the hell is Fillmore? I don't know. You think all this would be going on if Fillmore was here? What are you doing here? Judy's sick. I'm taking her place. Look, I don't want you around these guys. That's very brotherly. So this is why you're not home cooking dinner, huh? And you had Tommy lie about it. I didn't tell him to lie. Well, you damn sure told him not to tell me where you really were. I wish you wouldn't swear so much. You don't mind corrupting our little brother, but you don't like swearing. Go on home right now. I can't. I told Judy I'd stay for her. If I don't, she'll lose her job. 10 little Indians. Then there were nine. [ Gun clicks ] [ All laughing ] Then one got killed! You're funny. Does she love me? Hey, fellas, you think she loves me, huh? Do you love me? - Yes! - Well, show me! - All my brothers, do you love them? - Yes! Give me my panties! [ All shouting ] All right, go away! Go away! Now what am I bid for this fair maiden? 15¢! 15¢? What's the matter with you? I personally recommend... Joint? 26¢ and... The old man. What are you gonna do with the old man, huh? Look at that. Oh, bull, my boy, control yourself. All right, what am I bid now? What do you mean, 50¢? [ All shouting ] [ Men whistling ] I'll give you 52¢ for that! Going once, going twice... 50¢ and a bottle of muscatel. What are you doing? Get out of here! Come on, come on, come on. Let me go. Let me go. Oh... Hey, come here. You go away. Don't you understand? I like her. - I love her too. - What a bummer! This is turning out to be a bummer. [ Engines revving ] Isn't that one of my waitresses? Yes, sir, I think it is. Well, what's going on here? Some motorcycle riders. We didn't want to do anything until you got back. That figures. That sure was good. Glad you liked it. I'll bet that's your specialty. I never made it before. - I'll bet you haven't. - Leave her alone. - Get your hands-- - hey, he's my brother. Really? - Brother? - Yeah. Hey, come here. You got any dirty pictures of her? - You know, without any clothes on? - Huh? No? Would you like to buy some? [ Woman screams ] All right, party's over. You owe me some money, Fillmore. Get out of here. Not until you pay me. Oh, is that right, hmm? Taggert, this here Indian here is leaving. Wait a minute. I got some unfinished business with him. It can wait. Hyah! [ Men laugh ] Man, he's gonna kill him. Stop it! [ Grunting ] There's not gonna be much left for US, man. Maybe you didn't understand: I said I was first. - Get 'em all. - Karate! Ha, chair! Hey, bull, wait a minute. Ahhh! Ahh! Bull: What do you want to do with this one? Bring him here. All right, how much he owe you? $25. Get it up. You're a regular Robin hood, aren't you? Not really. If you had waited your turn now, you could have saved yourself 25 bucks. Let's go. Ha! Right. Man: Johnnie, you going to town with US or not? Oh, yeah. There's something I got to do first. Well, it's getting kind of late. Yeah. Besides, if we're gonna go bust up Fillmore's, we've got to get going. Yeah? Is that what we're gonna do? It's not what I had in mind. Tell US what you had in mind, Johnnie. Well, those bastards wanted to play cowboys and Indians... Let's give 'em a game. [ All chattering ] [ Moans ] [ Clucks ] Hi, honey. You remember me? [ Retching ] Hey, man, you just barfed on my broad. Well, I'm sorry, bull. It's okay. It's okay. What do you mean it's okay? Oh, shut up, pig. My brother stud wants to barf on a broad, he can barf on a broad. You want to barf on her? - Huh? - No, man, but thanks anyway. Hey, buddy! Huh? Hey-- hey, we really killed 'em tonight, didn't we? Yeah, man. I wish you would have let me keep going on that guy though, man. You know, I had him. I really had him. If I had, you would have killed him. Then where'd we be? Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Hey, you know they say it would really bother your conscience to kill somebody, you know? But I'd like to know what that'd feel like. Bull, man, it would feel like little pellets dropping into acid when they got you strapped in a chair. Yeah, but I'd still like to find out what it'd feel like to-- you know, to really take somebody and kill 'em. I just want to know what it'd feel like. You're a moron, you know that? I know I'm a moron, man. I've been a moron all my life. These boys laughed at me, but I don't care, man. I don't care. Hey? They don't laugh at you now, do they? Huh? Yeah-- no, man! Hey, they pee their panties when they see me coming! You better believe it, man. Ahhh! [ All screaming ] You move, he dies. White man make bad mistake when he hit Indian. The last one we staked out-- they didn't find him until the maggots were crawling out of his eye sockets. Pretty scary, huh? You all right, buddy? You all right, huh? Well, let's go get them. Come on. Somehow I don't think we'd find them out there. [ Men chanting, shouting ] Hey man, they stole a case of beer from US. You guys going back to camp or what? Not for awhile. Listen, why don't you guys go back inside and finish your coffee, huh? Man, I told you: She's out to lunch. Hi. Hey. Hey. Now is that any way to act? You know, if it wasn't for US, your brother wouldn't have gotten paid last night. And he wouldn't have gotten fired either. Now wait a minute. Wait a minute. He doesn't need any help from US in that department. The way he acts, he could get himself fired just about anywhere. Seely? You got a customer. You better have cash. Mr. Fillmore said after last night, no more credit for you or your family. Get out of there! You want that candy, boy? Yes. Well, you go on and you take it. Go on. You gonna let him do that to you? What? It wasn't your fault. I told you to take the candy - and he hit you. - Yeah, I know. You go on back there and you take some. Yeah, but he'll hit me again. - No, he won't. - You sure? Just wait'll he isn't looking. But you gotta move faster. Now go on. Hurry up. That was pretty good. But you know you're still gonna have to be faster. I don't think I want any more candy. Okay. You've been asking for this, punk. Hey, what's going on? Oh, is that terrible man making trouble again? - Hey! - Look what you've done. Oh, you're a big man with your whole gang behind you! Well, that's how it is, man. Just like you and your friends were gonna work over her brother last night. Uh, you better just pick up the candy, tiger. They're a bunch of no-good punks! That's what they are. Ha ha! Hey, man, you gonna yell "karate" again? Hyah! Come on. Come on! Well, come on, bubby. That's it. Ahh! Man: Yeah, you got him now! [ Men cheering ] [ Cheering continues ] Stop it! [ All laughing ] "Stop it!" Let's get the poor man out of here! - Oh, let's get him. - Ooh! Oh, let's help bubby up here. Here we go. Okay! We got-- look, he's bleeding white, man. Oh, he's hurt. The poor man. Give him a powder puff! A powder puff! Hey, you, come here a minute. I just talked to Fillmore on the phone... And he said she can have her credit back. Man: Oh! That's not bad. No, wait. He said she can have whatever she wants for free. As a matter of fact, everyone in this stinkin' place can have whatever they want for free. - Now wait a minute-- - shut up... Or you're gonna wake up in the desert with lizards looking at you. Where's the rest of your people? Ring the bell outside. They'll all come. Wally, ring that bell. Hey, kid, go get your buddies and you tell them there's free candy for all. Free candy! Free candy! [ Ringing ] Free candy! Over at the store! Free candy! Free candy! Free candy! Over at the store! Free candy! [ All chattering ] Hey, what's up? Hey, stud, is this enough or what? Little bit more. - Little bit-- - come on, man. What are you trying to do? Hey, there you go. Wait a minute! Wait a minute! No no no! Go on. You can come back later. Go on. Here, let's fill this one up. Wait a second. This isn't gonna work. Let's get this stuff outside. Come on. Here we go. Here we go. Hey, come on, will you? All of it outside! Let's go! What are you trying to do to me? - [ Ringing ] - Call the highway patrol. Jack down at Fillmore's! Tell him to get here right away. Well, if it isn't our local war party? Do you need help? Yeah. Come on. What should we do? Take as much as we can. But that's stealing! What do you think Fillmore's been doing to US? It's the best thing that ever happened to these people. Hey, dog face, don't stack the milk! If you put it in with the bread it's gonna get soggy, man. Come on, git! Get it! I got it, mister, just like you said. Okay, kids, now listen: It's just like pay day. Go on in and take all the candy you can carry. Go on, it's all yours. Go on in. Maria, get Tommy. He needs shoes. No. Who's gonna pay for all of this when it's over? Them? They'll be gone, Johnnie. We'll-- we'll wind up paying. Then let's get all we can-- now! [ Giggling ] Hey, kisum! One of the kids just told me Johnnie's got a pickup truck. Wonderful. Yeah, man, but if we had that truck, think of all the beer we could haul back to camp. Hey, Johnnie. Listen, go get your truck, will you? What for? All the better to haul big goodies away. What do you think he'll say when he finds out you mean beer? I don't really care. Bull: Let's go, huh? Let's clean it out! Let's clean it out fast! Hey man, don't put the canned stuff on top of the fruit! That wasn't all that bad, was it? Forget the salt, just get food! Who needs that? Let's go. Grab the stuff-- yes! Straighten this, will you? Little bit of chips up here! Here we go! Here we go. Some more chips up here! Here's some kellogg's. Here you go! Here's some this; Here's some that. - Here you go-- - kisum! Kisum! - The cops are coming. - Where? What? - Right down the road. - Let's get out of here! They called the police! Get out of here! Right now! Go! Get out of here! Go on! - Oh! - Back in! - Come on! - I'm not going anywhere! Would you rather wind up in jail? [ Sirens wailing ] What's going on here? Come on! Go after them! Never catch 'em out there. Well, Mr. Fillmore is not gonna like this. That's one of them right there! Balls. Baseballs, footballs. What did you think I was talking about? Huh? What did you think? I should have let the cops have you. Why? Because I have principle? Oh, really? Where were those principles a little while ago in the store? I made a mistake. Mistake, hell. You sold out. Everybody sells out if the price is right. Only I never heard of anyone ever selling out for a pair of tennies before. Right? What about your friends, your gang, your tough talk, that costume you're wearing? You get candy and groceries for little kids. I bet you even play baseball with rival gangs, hmm? What do you do when you lose, kisum? Do you beat 'em up? That's right. I think I hit a nerve. Congratulations. I didn't know you had feelings. Oh, yeah, just like real people. But of course. Hey, we're no different from anyone else, except that we're honest about what we want. And what we want, we take. What if somebody says no? Then we take it anyway. True. Oh! [ Squeals ] No. See? [ Groans ] Can't anything about you be gentle? - Hey! - Hello! [ All laughing ] How the hell are you? [ All greeting ] Leave me alone. What's the matter? You just like Indian broads? Or are you jealous? Oh, really? Any of you guys interested in this new mama? [ All laughing ] - No, kisum. - Don't keep the brothers waiting! [ Men hoot, whistle ] Man: She's yours, man. What happened to you? The man-- they got bull, rodeo and a lot of them Indians. How many cops are there? Four. No problem. You better believe there won't be. Hey, joint! They got bull and rodeo, man. Let's see what we can do about it. Hey, kisum, they let me go. - Why? - Fillmore, he's got a message for you. He wants to see you. Got to be a trap. Well, let's not disappoint 'em. No talking! Johnnie. All right, baby! Hey, get US out of here, huh? Well now, if it isn't miss goody-two-shoes and her bandit brother. Aren't you taking a big chance coming back here now? Haven't you heard? We've been invited. Would you get away from the prisoner? Pardon me. You hear, Maria? The nice man wants US to leave. The, uh, j. Edgar seemed a little hostile. He's gonna looked a little stepped on before this is over too. You going in to see Fillmore? Yeah, I might as well. Only don't let 'em cut out with those guys until I come out. Okay. Taggert, you don't seem to understand. Now can't you get it through your head that this store don't mean a damn thing UN-- get out of here. Leave US alone. Business seems to be tapering off. I notice you cleaned the place up since last night. Well, I had some rowdy customers. How about that? You gonna offer me a drink? Isn't that the way it's done. Help yourself. Okay. This is classy stuff. Sure beats white port and lemon juice. Those, uh, friends of your out there-- now I press charges, and they'll be gone for a long time. You gotta get 'em to jail first. Well, there are four deputies out there... With shotguns. Well now, it just might be nip and tuck for awhile, but I think we'll make it. - [ Train whistle blows ] - [ Laughs ] My oh my, you guys really aim to buy trouble, hmm? Only if we have to. Well, in this case, you don't. I'm willing to drop the charges. What do you want? For you to level that shacktown out there. Come again? I want you to... Knock down their houses and drive 'em off into the desert. Why? Well, let's just say that I want to teach 'em a lesson. Just like that, huh? Then who do you sell your goodies to? I'll worry about that. And we're supposed to go out and destroy those Indians for goodwill, huh? Well, goodwill and... 50 bucks a piece. You really mean it, don't you? Oh, yeah. I really mean it. Well, I'd need some help. I'd have to call in some extra guys. The offer holds for all you can get. All right... But for 75 bucks a-piece, and all the beer we can drink and carry out, and you drop the charges against the Indians. Well, it might be easier if they were in jail. I'll worry about that. It might be a little difficult to explain to the cops. You can worry about that. $60! And you get to get everything else you want. Mister, you got yourself a deal. - Where's the phone? - Right over there. I thought most of you guys had oil Wells or something. Being exploited by the white man was good enough for our ancestors, so we thought it might be good enough for US. Hey. [ Rooster crows ] Mr. Fillmore, that great American, has something to say to you. I mean you, creep. He's dropping the charges against everybody! - [ All cheer ] - Yeah! What the hell is he talking about? In the long run, it'll be better if everything that happened here today was forgotten. I love you! Love you! All right, all right! Come here, brother. You're beautiful. You're beautiful! What happened in there? Man, you just won't believe it. I'll tell you later. Oh, yeah? Let's get on the bikes! [ Cheering ] [ Singing, tambourine shaking ] Nemore, you think I'm cheap? I told you not to call me that. I'm sorry. But do you? - What? - Think I'm cheap. I mean, what would people say, my going off with you the first time I met you? Are you kidding? A good-looking stud like me with a little old chopper that goes from zero to supersonic in six seconds flat? Baby, you're showing class. I am... A hunter. You're damn right you are. You have a good heart. Here. Now you are a hunter. Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot. Bull: Hey, kisum! What do you got there? Oh yeah, that makes me a hunter. Really? Yeah. Hey, man, it's very nice. Right. Eat. Love. - Stop! Stop him! - What's the matter? He stole my chicken. Hey, rodeo. Rodeo! 50 bones, man. You can have her. And you, Mr. Bird, you come with me. Oh, hey, kisum, I'd rather have the chicken. Yee-hoo! Yah-hoooo! Yee-haa! [ Horse neighing ] I told you to leave her alone! Oh, is that what you told me? - That's what I told you. - Get your hands off her! Wait a minute! All right, what's wrong? Stay out of it, kisum! There's nothing you can do. You don't want to lose any money over it, do you? Huh? Seems she can't make up her mind. You know, there could be some problems over this, man. I know another way to settle it. What's that? It's an old Indian game. It's called a gauntlet! The one that makes it all the way up and back gets the girl. What if they both make it? Then they either become friends and beat up the girl or try again. All: Yee-haa! Hyah! Come on! [ All cheering ] Hey, baby, you beat the Indian! You won the girl! Uh, the hell with the broad. This is out of sight. I'll try it again! Man: Come on! Come on! It just may replace baseball. You gonna try it? I might if I can't find something better to do. Hey, I got me something better. We're going out to the desert and we're never coming back. - Both of 'em for you, huh? - Yeah. No wonder you guys were always losing to the cowboys. Hey, Maria said she'd like to talk to you a minute. [ Cheering and engine revving continue ] I wanted to thank you. Why don't you? Thank you. You're welcome. I mean for talking to Fillmore and fixing up everything with Johnnie and the others. You know, bull is right-- this place stinks. Would you like some coffee? You'd probably prefer beer, but we don't have any. No, coffee'd be fine. Hey, tell me something: Who did your decorating, sargent shriver? [ Laughs ] It won't always be like this. Yeah, I know. I got a feeling everything's gonna change overnight. But when they finish the dam in a year, this whole place will be a resort. What's the matter, kisum? When your brother said you wanted to talk to me, I didn't figure you just wanted to talk, that's all. I thought it didn't matter what anybody else wanted, just what you wanted. I wanted it to matter to you. Really? Really. What? What is it? [ Revving continues ] I might as well do this thing right. If I'm gonna be a bear, it might as well be a grizzly. I'll be right back. [ Door closes ] [ All cheering ] Hey, Fillmore! What the hell do you want? I thought i'd let you know: I changed my mind. Good night. [ Cheering ] He's gonna win! Here he comes! [ Door closes ] [ Rooster crowing ] Boy: What do you got in there? Oh, so you grow your own grass, huh? Yeah, see, I got the idea from a guy who lives upstairs. And he had plants and flowers and pots, so I figured that if people... Potted plants, it'd be okay if I planted pot. Right? I'm a horticulturalist. Hey, Johnnie, guess who slept at our house last night? [ Door opens ] Hey, John. John! John! I'm gonna knock your brains out! Stop it! You going with 'em? Well, go ahead! No, don't worry! Tommy and I will scrape 50¢, 60 together! We'll buy you back at the auction that night! What do you got? If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have the food she's cooking! Or the goddamned shoes on your brother's feet! Stop it! How about our house, huh? We won't have our house tonight 'cause of you! What are you talking about? Now you found out, huh? He and Fillmore made a deal yesterday. Fillmore's gonna pay them to tear down our houses. Kisum! What you don't know is that I called that deal off last night! But you were gonna do it! Yeah, I was gonna do it! Oh, that's real funny! All those people-- it was kinda funny! I'm beginning to wish I hadn't changed my mind! What about me? You're the biggest joke of all. Let's get out of this dump. What's going on? I don't know. Looks bad. What seems to be the problem? Which one of you is Richard Robert Lee? I don't know who you're talking about. What the hell do they want? They want bull for something. Maybe you ought to tell me what he did! - He raped and killed my daughter. - Oh no, man. I swear to god, you're wrong. His motorcycle was found by her. I'm going to kill him. And if you don't tell me who he is, I will kill all of you. I told you, you made a mistake. Now if you want to make another one, you come on ahead. Brother, go get some help! [ Shotgun blasts ] I, uh, just phoned the police. I think we'll let them handle it this time. Where's bull? I don't know, man. I haven't seen him since last night. You okay? Yeah, I'm okay. I just have a very bad feeling, that's all.

All right, man. Hey, it's not your fault. I should have stopped them at the store. She'd still be alive. Come on. Come on. Hey, Johnnie, they found that bastard. Oh, and somebody done him in good.

Somebody's gonna be. [ All screaming ] I'm gonna get me an Indian! A lousy stinkin' Indian for bull! [ All cheer ] Stick it in your nose, man. Bull was lame. He had marbles in his crankcase.

You killed him, didn't you? - Huh? - It wasn't me, it was seely. - He did it for Fillmore. - And the girl? He kill the girl too? Yeah. Why? So he could get rid of you Indians and get the land back. They're really building a lake here. Keep him here. Hey, listen! Hold it! - Look! - So what? I got it off of taggert! Fillmore killed bull and the girl! Wait a minute! We gotta stop this! - Huh? - They didn't kill bull! Well, that don't make no difference, not now. Fillmore! Mr. Fillmore. We gotta get out of here. Why, taggert? Hurry. We gotta go.

Come on, taggert, now tell me: You told them, huh? - Come on! - I had to tell them! They were gonna kill me. There won't be anything left of this place if they attack like they did the shacktown. Get out front and get the car. Taggert? We got one chance to beat this... But not with him around to talk. Who's to say that the motorcycle guys or the Indians didn't do this?
