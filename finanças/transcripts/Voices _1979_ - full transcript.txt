Every time I go to school he asks me "Where is my money?" How much you've paid him? I don't believe he's got a whole gang behind me. - How much you've paid him? - Nothing. Alright? Every time I pass 'em in the hallway they punch me in my arm to make sure my memory don't go stale. Look at this. - Where? - Look. - Jeez. - Huh? [cars honking] Who's she? Tell Johnny you're not paying him another cent. I'll meet you after school we'll settle it. - Don't worry. - She's beautiful. Hi. I'm Drew. Rosemarie, right? I was hopin' to run into you.

Must be hard to read lips. You must miss a lot. What? Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Someone...stole my tape recorder. So I made one of those records and took it to an agent. So he could hear my voice. [silence] [indistinct chattering] [indistinct chattering] Can I call you? "Can I call you".. [indistinct chattering] [silence] I'm here to pick up the laundry. - Follow me. - Okay. See him. Ha ha ha.

You oughta get yourself insured. - I like your sweatshirt, Drew. - So do I. Listen, Pinky. Your little brother, he's been strong arming Raymond. Johnny's not so-- What's he doin' playing poker with an eighth grader? Can't find guys his-- Raymond's a wise guy. He has to play. You tell your brother that the debt is called off. - And leave Raymond alone. - You telling me what to do? I'm telling you the debt is off. - Don't tell me what to do. - Okay. Then I'm informing you. Does that sound better to you, Pinky? I'm informing you. And where's the laundry? come on, where is it? - You know, Drew. - What? Hey Pinky, Mr. Patterson wants to see you. Right away. Come on. [drilling machine buzzing] Mr. Patterson. Don't you sing at the Orchid Club? - You've been there? - He owns the building. I'm not working there anymore. Fat Floyd turned the place into a meat joint. - Yeah. - Don't you think he knows that. He's here for the laundry. You know what I am going to do with this room? Gonna turn this building into a night club with live music. Good food and good music you can't beat that combination. - It's a great idea. - Glad you like it. Take him down and give him some laundry and hurry back. - I have some errands for you. - Right away. Mr. Patterson, you've booked the group to play here yet? Not yet, can you recommend one? Maybe you couldn't tell from the Orchid Club. But we got a strong sound, my band is hot. - Hot, huh? - Yeah, can we audition? Call tomorrow and speak with Redman. I don't know what you're so happy about? Your singing is nothing to be happy about. He was just being polite. You better show me the cleaning, Pinky. I don't wanna hold up your errands.

Hiya, Drew. Helen, you're lookin' pretty as always. Hey, String, what do you got? A hot tip for my father which will cost him $200 again? - 'Hey, you didn't tell him.' - Tell him what? I gave that tip that won him six and a half yards last week. And for nothin'.I gave him that tip to make up for before. You got a big mouth, String. I should have known you didn't pick those horses yourself. Last night, I'm in a men's room at Floyd's stinkin' hole. But what a tip I overheard 'as I was squatting on the John with my legs up.' Hey, String. [String] 'Alright. Anyway, last night I overheard' two hoods from Jersey City whisperin' about a fixed race! - 'A banana race at Oakwood.' - A banana race, you sure? I swear on my mother's grave. I heard it with my own two ears. I'm going around trying to raise every nickel I can. I sold my car. [String] 'Not even the connected bookies know about this one.' 'The horse is such a friggin'long shot' 'the big boys don't wanna touch the yards.' It's a very private affair. 'I'm telling you, Frank.' - This is "get rich" day. - Yeah. 'I've never had a tip like this before.' How much for the horse's name? Don't freak when you hear the price. Because what I'm doing for you is going to change your financial life. - How much, you squirrel? - Fifty. Fifty bucks you charge a friend that helped you when you were down. Make it five dollars. Frank, I'm only trying to raise money. - You're gonna make a fortune. - What if you're wrong? Oh, rip my eyes out. Slit my throat. [String] 'Drop me in the Hudson if this horse don't win by ten lengths.' Don't touch me. - How much did you take out? - Enough. How much is enough? Plenty. I hope you're not being stupid. No, pa. For once I'm being smart. Good. So, how much? [sighs] Don't you like surprises? I had the last surprise years ago from your mother. And what was that? You. That's cute, Pa. Now, give me Floorwaxer..

'He's got him under the whip.' 'It's Floorwaxer and Sleepwalker.' 'Floorwaxer and Sleepwalker' 'What the hell is that?' 'Sleepwalker goes just over the inside rail.' 'The finish was Floorwaxer..' Hey. Come on, take it easy. 'Hold all tickets, the inquiry sign is up.' [Drew] 'What happened?' [Nathan] 'They juiced him too much.' [Drew] 'Juiced? What do you mean?'

[Frank] 'What girl?' - That beautiful girl's deaf? - 'Yeah!' - What girl? - Will you stop yelling? Her name is Rosemarie Lemon. And she can't hear, this-this Lemon? That's what deaf usually means, don't it? To find out what it's like I plugged my ears with cotton for a couple days. 'And went to the library and I got this book.' What happened to her? I mean, she's always been deaf? I don't know. I never asked her. Wait a minute. - Deaf girl, huh? - Yeah. How do you talk to her? We talk in sign language. What do you think the book is all about? - What, is she deaf and dumb? - She is not dumb. She's smarter than all of us. She's a teacher. - Hey. - What? I don't like that word. Come on, I didn't mean it like that. She graduated from college. That's nice. If she's deaf, how come she don't talk? [children laughing] Faster faster faster.

Were you.. ...born deaf? You got sick? You had a fever. You had measles. And then you just... lost your hearing. Six years old, you lost it. Wow. When I was six, you couldn't shut me up. Motor-mouth, my mother used to call me. [silence] Yeah. What were you like... when you were six? [thunder rumbling] No. Tell me. [rumbling continues] Talk to me. Let me hear your voice. Woo.. [sobbing] [rumbling continues] I don't sound good. I don't care what you sound like. What I care about, is you. [instrumental music] Come on. [Drew laughs] [music continues] [door lock clicking] I'm gettin' my own place soon. I gotta get my own place. The maid called in... sick today. The robe, it's clean. You can change in here. [laughs] My grandfather, Nathan. - Come on, Nate. - Huh? - Time to go to bed. Come on. - Ah. Oh. Oh, yeah. Is that her? Huh? - Yeah, Nate, this is Rosemarie. - Oh. You are...soaking wet. The girl's shivering. I'm okay. Oh, you're talking, too! Talks, walks, eats, she does everything. - She even gets wet. Come on. - Where are you going? Come on. It's time for bed. Let's go. Where are you going? Hmm? Let's go to bed. Come on. - You're still asleep. Come on. - No, I'm awake. I want to talk to Rosemarie. I really want to talk to her. - Sometime later. - After she's dry. After she's dry. After she's dry, huh? I'm gonna change. [thunder rumbling] Okay, come on. Now, stay here and go to sleep, right? Frank took Helen to the movies. I know. I know. Now, goodnight. And don't come out. She is beautiful. [thunder rumbling] [melodic instrumental music] [music continues] [melodic music] [music continues] Don't move. [Drew] 'What are you doing?' Ah, Jesus. You sacred me. What the hell are you doing? Ah, some cockroach attacked my big toe. Clean it up. Get back to bed. You got somebody in here with you? She's watching TV. [laughs] Let me see her. Get back to bed, Raymond. You're getting anything? - Hey. - What? Watch your mouth. - I'm going in there. - You do and I'll kill you. Ask if she's got a little sister, you know. I mean, tell her I'm going through puberty. We got wet. Clothes are drying. Take that stupid look off your face. I'm not stupid, I'm Raymond. Hello, Raymond. Hi, h-hello. You know, you don't, uh, you don't sound too bad. You sound kind of foreign. - What's going on? - Oh, Christ. You dry? Somebody! We went to Ernie's bar after the movie. Frank got into a drinking match with Ernie. - It's gonna ring. - Hold still. I got him. I got him. That's...this must be dream girl. - Ah, it's a circus. - It's okay. You got wet, right? I'm Helen. He's drunk. Don't worry, no need to explain nothing in this house. - Nothing ever goes right. - You're nice girl. [Drew] 'Stop breathing on my face. You stink.' [Frank] 'Helen, give me a kiss.' [Helen] 'You are drunk. You're always getting drunk.' [Drew] 'Okay, roll up.' 'Come on, move.' [thumping and crashing] [Frank] 'Helen?' [Helen] 'I'll not stay here and crack your back 'until you fall asleep again.' [Frank] 'I'm waiting.' [Drew] 'This place is a mad house.' 'It's a circus. It's a god damn three-ringed circus!' [door latch rattling] I'm worried about you. 'And why didn't you let me know?' Nothing happened. I was at his family. [cat meows] Scott has his own apartment car, college education and future. You two have so much...in common. All we have in common is, we're deaf. That's not enough. It's a...hard world out there. It's a hard world in here. You have only met one deaf man that you really liked. You want to cast him away for a romantic fling? It's not a fling. - How do you know? - I know. - How? - I know. Has he talked to you about the future? - No, he hasn't. - Doesn't have to. Oh, doesn't have to. But two months from now or six months from now or a year from now. When he realizes how hard it is to live...with a deaf woman. He will say.. ...goodbye. And Scott won't be here...anymore. [crying] I.. ...love you. [sniffling] This man.. ...his whole life is.. ...his ears. His music. And you...will never be able to share his first love.. ...with him. Think about that. [male on phone] 'Saturday, Frank.' I need much more time, Mr. Geosovo. 'Do I get the feeling you're not gonna pay up?' No, no. I'll have it. Don't worry. 'It would be stupid if you don't pay.' No, no. I'm not planning not to pay. - 'Half by Saturday.' - Talk to you soon. 'You know, I always knew you weren't a slime.' 'Don't be a schmuck.' Please, don't talk to me that way, Mr. Geosovo. Hello? I need to talk to you about something. Um.. ...not now okay, Drew. Please. Can't do it now, please. Pa, I'll be back later. Watch the store. You gotta minute? [Nathan] 'What's up?' Nate.. Nate, I really dig this girl. So? - Ah, you don't understand. - I understand. Yeah, I do. Nate, I'm not sure. All of a sudden I'm not sure. If I'm not looking at her when I'm talking to her she doesn't see what I'm saying. Sounds funny. But if she doesn't see what I'm saying she don't hear me. You got to learn to look at her when you talk. It ain't that simple. Nothing worthwhile comes easy. I don't know. I think.. ...maybe she's better off with this other guy. Drew, you're not a thinker. - Is it an insult? - No. Just the fact. You love to dream. Now, she has become real for you. The way your grandmother was for me. Real...is not easy. - So, what are you telling me? - I'm not telling you anything. Nobody can. But...your mother would have liked Rosemarie for you. You think so? Don't you? [melodic music] [music continues] [ferry whistling] [music continues] Why not? It's what you want, isn't it? You'll never know, if you don't try. Know what? That you can be a professional dancer. Drew, I'm deaf. - I can't hear. - But you're a terrific dancer. I need to listen. I'm deaf, the company may.. Wait a minute. You feel vibrations, right? [chuckles] So we'll get them to boost the sound up turn the speakers to the floor and you'll just follow the other dancers. There's nothing to be afraid of. It's only an audition. The worst that can possibly happen is they'll say no. Look at me. I was breaking my back every night in that brewery dreaming of becoming a singer. So, I said to myself am I going to die a dreamer. Like my mother, who wanted to be an actress. My father talked her out of it. Dad wanted to live in California but my grandfather talked him out of it. Everybody is always talking everybody else out of trying to do what they wanna do. It's easy to get talked out of it, 'cause people are afraid to want something 'cause they might not get it. You didn't get.. Oh, boy. [laughing] What I'm saying is.. ...be a dancer.. ...if it's want you want. You're gonna knock 'em out. And I'll come with you. I'll be right with you. I'll be there all the way. The way you move.. ...you belong on a stage. You're great. You could do it. Come on, Raymond. Let's go. I gotta meet Rosemarie. I'm really late. Alright. [phone ringing] [Drew] 'Hey, Raymond. Get the phone.' - 'Uh-huh.' - 'Get it!' [Raymond] 'I'll flip you. Heads or tails?' [Drew] 'Raymond, get it! I gotta meet Rosemarie!' [Raymond] 'Tails, you get it.' [Drew] 'You always got to be the clown, huh?' Yeah. [Nathan] 'You better get down to the store right away.' - I can't hear you. - 'Get down here.' 'He bet more than we thought on that Sleepwalker.' - What do you mean? - 'He owes the bookies.' 'He's burning the store down for the insurance.' Hang on! [indistinct chattering] [choreographer] 'Hey, girls, put your names. Your addresses..' [silence] [choreographer] 'Next five!' 'Put your name, your address, your phone number' 'and your availability, please.' When do you start.. [silence] '...and this is a open choir, right?' [choreographer] 'That's right.' [silence] [female #2] 'What do you want here?' [choreographer] 'Numbers 25 through 30.' 'Alright people, what we're gonna do is..' [silence] You two up. You two down. [fire alarm ringing] [Drew] 'Where is the extinguisher? How do I use it?' [Nathan] 'Clear the racks!' [choreographer] 'First to eight is the chain steps.' 'Hit it, five, six, seven, eight.' 'One, two, three, four, five, six, seven and repeat.' 'One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.' Now, the high jump. Ready. And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. And forward, one, two, three, four.. [silence] 'Ready. And one, two..' [silence] '...five, six, seven, eight.' Now, the eight-count contractions. We'll do it three times. Let's do it the once now. And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Number 26, if you haven't got it you can go with the next group. ...four, five, six, seven. Again. One, two, three, four.. [silence] '..five, six, seven, eight.' One, two, three, four, pull up, five, six, seven, turn. 'One, two, three, four, double pay and end.' [silence] [sirens wailing] Alright people, let's take it from the top. Four counts for nothing. Now, remember I have different steps. So, don't follow me. Two, three, four. [dance music] [music continues] [music continues] [music stops] Oh, sorry. [crying] I shouldn't have come. What happened? I couldn't hear what he was saying. I-I tried to follow him but.. You didn't, you didn't tell him? I knew, I couldn't do this. You can. You will. What happened? I'll tell you later. We're going back. [choreographer] 'One, two, three, four, five, six, seven and repeat.' 'One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.' 'Now, the high jump.' 'Ready. And one, two, three' 'four, five, six, seven and forward.' Next group of finalists, please. Hang on, just one minute. Hold it. Hold it, just one minute. - Get them out of here. - Hi, how you doing? It's nice to see you. Hi, how's it going? Sorry to barge in like this. I'm sorry to barge in like this. Actually, I'm not. 'Cause I got something great to show you' I think you missed. Her name is Rosemarie Lemon. - 'One "M".' - Hey, fella, look-- Excuse me. I'm talking. Could I please have the floor for a minute? You're Paul Janssen. 'Mr. Janssen, it's a pleasure to meet you.' 'My name's Drew Rothman.' And I am managing this beautiful dancer here. 'She had her chance.' No, no, no, Paul, I really don't think so, see.. Rose's a real special girl and you gotta audition her in a kind of a different way, you know what I mean? She was auditioned like everybody else. Oh, I understand that. What's your name? - Jerry. - Jerry, listen. Let's just keep it friendly okay? See, Rosemarie couldn't hear what Jerry told her before because Rosemarie can't hear. She's deaf. But that doesn't matter, that doesn't matter at all. Now, Jerry. Why don't you show Rosemarie, what you wanna do again, okay? Only this time, make sure you're looking directly at her when tell her, okay? It's no big thing, there's nothing to it you can handle it. One more thing. Just one more little favor, okay, Mr. Janssen. Why don't you and your assistant come on down here and sit in the front row, it's a much better view from down here. Alright. These are great seats, the best in the house, you'll love it. What are you, ah, doing now? Just one more adjustment. So, Rosemarie.. ...can feel.. ...the vibrations. Do you know the combination? There are two eights of chain steps. Two eights. There are three eights of the contraction combination. Now, I have different steps so don't follow me. You were following me before, don't follow me. Jerry, turn up the volume. [dance music] Two, three, four. [music continues] [music continues] [indistinct chatter] - 'Where's the music?' - Let's do one more, okay?
