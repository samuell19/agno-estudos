All the students come back We dare not to fight with you for glory Master Zhang, it's good that you understand Right, I won't involve you, farewell What's your plan... Boss Deng is a good person We'll go to his place and then decide what to do That would still involve boss Deng Besides, Chen has ordered the militia to search for you it's not that easy to go to boss Deng's Then we must fight our way Get me two sets of clothing Yes Master Zhang Maybe I should escort you to boss Deng's and discuss matters If he is willing to help we virtually own half of the troops and Chen Zu Guang wouldn't dare mess with us What are you looking at? Don't you recognise me? Master Zhang, why are you here? Have you seen boss Pan? We just found their trail Didn't boss Pan catch up with them? No The whole city is looking for them, they can't escape Okay, we're in boss Deng's territory Is boss Deng at the tavern?

Bring the troops to the tavern A wolf in sheep's clothing, we have been hoodwinked Let's get out of here Where to? The whole matter arose because chief Zeng got killed Let's swear allegiance to commander Huang They are all the same If we could escape to the other side of the river it's the area of the southern revolutionary troops Over here We're late They can't escape, you two come here Listen Boss Pan, you... Have they gone to boss Deng's? I don't know... They think boss Deng would help them not realising he has been on our side You say that Huang fellow is your relative and you have let him to be a watchman How is he related to you?
