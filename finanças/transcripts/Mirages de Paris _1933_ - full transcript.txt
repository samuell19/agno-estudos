That's how it is, every day! I rise to battle Evil! Come! Follow me! Let's be off to combat Evil! Pardon me, madam, who's the soloist with the big wings? Tonnerre, of course! Madam, is that really Tonnerre? Makeup does make a difference! Where's François? François, hurry! - Who was that tart? - What tart? - At the café! - Come on, François! Not you! No! Don't forget: Tonnerre says "Where is he?" and you say: "Here I am!" - Say, listen, you -- - You're crazy, I've got to sing! I'll make a scene! Not here! Come with me! - What do you want? - Who was the tart at the café? I don't know! Leave me alone, I've got to sing my line! - Are we even now? - Not yet! - I think that'll do. - Not yet!
