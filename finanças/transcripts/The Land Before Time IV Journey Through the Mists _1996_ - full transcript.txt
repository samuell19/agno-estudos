NARRATOR: Millions and millions of years ago, before there were countries, or cities, or states, before there were horses, or bears, or elephants, before the first human ever walked the earth, the world was filled with strange and wonderful creatures. The greatest of these creatures were called dinosaurs. (ROARS) But the realm of the dinosaur was changing. The weather, the plants, and the animals were beginning to transform. Still, despite the changes happening in the outside world, life in the Great Valley remained the same. Grr! Grr! (GRUNTS) (LAUGHS) Cera, you are a good green food getter, you are! CERA: Let's eat! (MUNCHING) ALL: Huh? ALL: Spike! (ALL LAUGHING) Hey, here's Spike. But where's Littlefoot? Hello. (BUZZING IN UPSET) Wait. Don't go. (LAUGHS) (BUZZING) (LAUGHING) (BUZZING) (LAUGHING) (GASPS) Whoa! (SIGHS) (FAINT GROWLING IN DISTANCE) Huh? Wow. Who are they? Who's who, Littlefoot? Over there, Cera. Look. Hey, they're long necks just like you, Littlefoot. Yeah. I wonder where they came from. Grandma! Grandpa! A herd of long necks are coming into our valley! Yes. We saw them, too, Littlefoot. (GRUNTS) Grandma, why are you washing my face? It's only gonna get dirty again. Because we're going to go and greet our visitors, Littlefoot. You want to look nice, don't you? Well, I guess. But who are they? And where do they come from? GRANDPA: They're our cousins, Littlefoot. They're a migrating herd. Migrating? GRANDPA: That means they travel and live in different places. You mean instead of living in one place like us? That's right. I wouldn't like that. I like living in the Great Valley. (LAUGHING) Yes. We do, too, Littlefoot. Now come. Let's go welcome our cousins. (LAUGHS) Okay! Hey! Do you think they have kids? I'm sure they do. Oh! Grandpa! Are you all right? Strange. I... I suddenly felt so tired. Perhaps we better stay here. Oh, nonsense. I feel better already. Well, Littlefoot, why don't you lead the way? All right! Everybody follow me. I'm fine, Grandma. Really. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Welcome to our valley, Old One. Yes. Now tell me, how is your climate? Our climate? It's... It's fine. And your land? Has it changed? Why, no, it hasn't. OLD ONE: Good. Of course, who knows how long that will last? What's that stuffy old long neck mean by, "Who knows how long that will last?" Shh! Hmm! My herd has roamed far and wide. And everywhere, things are changing. (GASPS) (ALL GASP) ALL: Changing? (FRIGHTENED CHATTERING) Old one, are you saying changes will happen here, too? I don't know. All I do know is that once, our land was just like yours. Then water fell from the sky for weeks on end. (THUNDER RUMBLING) Our land grew wet and soggy. Strange creatures began to make their home on what was once dry land. Other creatures moved into the trees that were our source of food. (SQUEAKING) The once green land we had migrated across for years had become... The Land of Mists. We had no choice but to leave. Does this mean that you and your herd will be staying with us, Old One? We stay in no place very long. You and the other Great Valley long necks may join us when we leave. After all, there is safety in numbers. Um... Grandpa, we're not going to migrate, are we? Of course not, Littlefoot. The Great Valley is our home. (RELIEVED SIGH) DUCKY: Oh, Littlefoot, I'm so glad you are not leaving. I am. I am. The Great Valley will never change. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Me glad you not leaving, too. Me miss you whole bunch. (LAUGHS) I'd miss you, too, Petrie. (SLURPS) (GIGGLING) Does this mean you'd miss me, too, Spike? (SIGHS) Um, Cera... Would you miss me? Well... I... Ooh! Maybe I would and maybe I wouldn't. I'm not telling. Why are you not telling, Cera? Is it a secret? Is it? Huh? Well, if you really want to know, you have to catch me first! Hee! (DUCKY GIGGLING) Me catch you, Cera! You'd better run fast! (DUCKY LAUGHING) Wait a minute. Is that you, Cera? Ow! (LAUGHS) Okay, Cera. You asked for it. (ALI GIGGLING) (GASPS) (BOTH EXCLAIMING) (CRASHING) (LAUGHS) Hey, you're not Cera. You're a long neck like me. I'm Ali. What's your name? Littlefoot. Um... You want to play with me, Littlefoot? Sure. Great! Not it! You're it! (LAUGHS) Maybe! But not for long! (BOTH LAUGHING) All right already! I'll tell Littlefoot I'd miss him. Then will you be happy? (LITTLEFOOT LAUGHING) Hey, look! There are two Littlefoots. (BOTH LAUGHING) Feets? There can't be two Littlefoots. It's impossible. But let's go see anyway. (BOTH LAUGHING) (GASPS) See? She's not another Littlefoot. She's a girl. Yup, yup, yup. She is a girl. Hi, everybody. This is my new friend, Ali. Hello, Ali. Hi, hi, hi. Hi, Ali. Me Petrie. And I'm Ducky. And this is my brother, Spike. Hey. He cannot talk like us. Oh, no. But he still says hello. And I'm Cera. A three-horn, of course. (GASPS) What's the matter, Ali? I'm... I'm afraid. Are we scary? Oh, yes! Petrie very scary! (INHALING) (GIGGLING) (AIR WHOOSHING) Well, it just so happens that three-horns can be very scary. Grr! (GASPS) Cera, you're not helping! Sorry. Gee, Ali. There's nothing scary about my friends. Honest. They're really, really nice. But Littlefoot, they're not long necks like us. I'm sorry, everyone. I can't play now. I don't understand why she's so scared. Hmm! She's not scared. She's stuck-up. Who needs her? Come on. Yeah. Hmm! Who need her? Are you coming, Littlefoot? I... I guess so. (SIGHS) ALI: Psst! Huh? Psst! Littlefoot, I'm over here. Did you change your mind? Do you want to play with me and my friends? (SIGHS) Ah, gee. (LITTLEFOOT LAUGHING) (BOTH LAUGHING) Where Littlefoot? Over there. (BOTH LAUGHING) With her! If Littlefoot would rather play with her, then he's not our friend! What? PETRIE: What? (CROAKING) (BOTH LAUGHING) Whoa! (GRUNTS) (LAUGHS) Oops. Sorry, Littlefoot. Oh, that's okay. You're really fun, Littlefoot. I hope we're friends. Of course we're friends. And friends share! (LAUGHS) (GASPS) Friends? I ran off and left them. I better go make sure they're not mad at me. Cera! Ducky! Petrie! Spike! I guess they all went home. I guess. Come on. It's late. My grandma and grandpa will be worried. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) (LONG NECK TUTTING) LONG NECK 1: It doesn't look good. LONG NECK 2: Terrible. Grandma, what is it? What's wrong with Grandpa? Your Grandpa is very ill, Littlefoot. Ill? Well, he'll get better, won't he? I don't know, Littlefoot. Some dinosaurs do. And some don't. I've seen this sickness many times in my life. No dinosaur ever recovers from it unless... Unless what? Unless they eat the golden petals of the night flower. The night flower? LONG NECK 1: Did you hear that? The night flower. Yes. Golden petals. Sick dinosaurs eat them and are cured if they eat them in time. Grandma, we have to get the night flower for Grandpa! Old One, where can I find the night flower? In the land we came from. The Land of Mists. (GASPS) (FRIGHTENED MURMURING IN CROWD) The Land of Mists. Cousins, who will take me to the night flower? Not me. I'm not going back there. You'd have to be crazy. The land has changed too much. Long necks are not welcome there. But what about my grandpa? OLD ONE: It is too dangerous. Come, Ali, it's late. But, Mother, isn't there any way we can help? I'm sorry, dear. We can do nothing. GRANDPA: Littlefoot? Yes, Grandpa? Littlefoot, I want you to promise that if anything happens to me... But, Grandpa, nothing is going to happen. I'm going to take care of you. You're still very young. Grandma isn't as strong as she once was. If our valley does change, I won't be here to protect you. Our cousins are strong. And the Old One is wise. I don't think she's so smart. Littlefoot, promise me that you and Grandma will go with them if the time comes. But, Grandpa, you're going to get better. Promise me. I promise. It's time to sleep, Littlefoot. But I want to help you watch Grandpa. You can help me by getting some rest. But there has to be more I can do. Littlefoot, we all must learn to accept what the great circle of life hands us. No. Please try to understand, little one. There is nothing we can do. And try not to worry. The great circle of life brings us many good things, too. Sometimes when we least expect them. The circle of life is simple, yet profound. * A quite straightforward line * That goes around and round and round * It's starts at the beginning And it will never end. * And that to me must surely be * Life's secret, my friend * For the circle of life * Continues everyday * None of us can stop it * From going on its way * With each new generation * One more circle is complete * On and on and on it goes repeating * Repeating * Repeating * Repeating * It nurtures the young * Until they're fully grown * And soon life's magic circle * Brings them children of their own * The family of nature * Each husband * And wife * Enhances the circle * The ever widening circle * The wonderful circle * Of life Good night, my little one. (GROANS) There is something I can do! I can find the night flower. I'll be back! Please don't worry. (ALL SNORING) Ali! Ali, wake up! Huh? Littlefoot? Shh! What are you doing here? I've got to find the night flower. What? Shh. Will you tell me where to find it? I can't, Littlefoot. It's too dangerous. The Land of Mists is filled with horrible monsters. You can't go by yourself. I'm not. I'm going to ask Cera, Ducky, Petrie and Spike to go with me. But what about me? Well... I... I didn't think you'd want to come because you... You don't like my friends. And besides, you just said you didn't want to go. I'll go. But... But we can't take the others. Huh? See? If we take them, it'll only slow us down. I don't know. Hurry, Littlefoot. I know the way. The others don't. We have to go now or the grown-ups will try and stop us. I could not find Littlefoot anywhere. Oh... I no find him, either. Oh, he's probably just hiding from us so he can play with that dumb old Ali. (MOCKINGLY) "Oh, Littlefoot, I'm afraid! "Your friends are so scary!" (ALL LAUGHING) "Keep them away! Keep them away!" (ALL LAUGHING) GRANDMA: Littlefoot! That is Littlefoot's Grandma. GRANDMA: Littlefoot, where are you? Something is wrong. It is. It is. Littlefoot! I'm afraid he's gone to find the night flower, oh, my brave Littlefoot. Are you sure you know where we're going, Ali? Well, sort of. Sort of? See, my herd has moved so much, sometimes I lose track of where I am, or where I've been. But don't worry. I think we go this way. (SIGHS) (WATER FLOWING) Littlefoot! (GASPS) It's beautiful! ALI: Oh, Littlefoot, I remember this waterfall. We are going the right way after all. Come on! We gotta pass through this cave. Wow! Let's go! (BOTH LAUGHING) Why are we stopping, Ali? Dark water. It means it's real deep. My mother had to carry me through it. Is there another way through the cave? I don't know. Well, we'll just have to go exploring. Come on. Ali, look! That looks like the way to go. Race you! (BOTH LAUGHING) I think we better go back. (ECHOING) Go back. Go back. Go back. What was that? I don't know. But I think he wants us to go. Who are you? (ECHOING) Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? (BOTH GULP) I'm Littlefoot! (ECHOING) I'm Littlefoot. I'm Littlefoot. I'm Littlefoot. You can't be down there if you're up here, can you? I don't think so. (RUMBLING) (GASPS) (GASPS) Earthshake! (BOTH SCREAMING) Jump! (SHRIEKING) (GASPS) Littlefoot? Littlefoot? Littlefoot, are you all right? (STRAINING) I can't do this by myself. Don't worry, Littlefoot. I'll be back. (MOANS) Ali? Ali? Can you hear me? GRANDMA: And then when Littlefoot's Grandpa got sick, the Old One told us that only the golden petals of the night flower could cure him. Littlefoot was so worried about his Grandpa. That's why I know he's gone to the Land of Mists, to find the night flower. Oh, no, no, no, no. Or maybe he's really off playing with that dumb old what's-her-name. Her name is not What's-Her-Name, Cera. It is Ali. Remember? (SIGHS) Littlefoot wouldn't just go off and play, Cera. Not with his Grandpa so sick. Besides, Ali is missing, too. She probably knows the way to the Land of Mists. I'm sure she and Littlefoot are both searching for the night flower. Oh, do not worry. We will go and get them. We will. No, Ducky. You mustn't. I can't risk you young ones, too. The Land of Mists is a dangerous place. You must promise me you won't go there. Uh... Okay. I promise. Me promise, too. Oh, the more I think about it, the madder I get. Littlefoot should've asked us to go with him. But no, he wanted to go along with his new friend. Yes, his new friend. Maybe Littlefoot thought we would not want to go. Maybe. Ha! Well, maybe I've changed my mind. Maybe I don't want to go after Littlefoot after all! (GASPS) Cera! Oh, besides! Who even knows where that dumb old Land of Mists is anyway? I'm sure the grown-ups aren't gonna tell us. ALI: Cera! Ducky! Petrie! Spike! (GASPING) I'm so glad I found you. Ali! You back! Where's Littlefoot? Littlefoot? Well, he's... See, there was this terrible earthshake. And the cave fell down and... ALL: And? You've got to come now! We coming, Ali. Well, I'm not! Why should we believe her? She probably made that story up. I did not. What we do now? What do you think, Spike? He thinks we should go. Okay. (GRUMBLES) Ooh! (STRAINING) Ali? Ali? Are you out there? I've got to find another way out. (SIGHS) At least now it's not so dark anymore. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING IN UNISON) (GASPS) (GRUNTS) Grr! (SCREAMS) Whoa! What are you doing in my cave? (GASPS) Well, you see... (GROWLS) Hey, you don't have any teeth. (GROWLING MEEKLY) (SIGHS) Oh, yeah, yeah. I know. I couldn't scare anybody if my life depended on it. But you can't blame a guy for trying. This cave's a dangerous place, you know? I know. The name's Archie. What's yours? Littlefoot. So tell me, Littlefoot, what are you doing here all alone? I'm not alone. I'm with my friend, Ali. I mean, if she's all right, that is. It's just around this bend. Oh, lookie. Wow... ALI: Hurry! Littlefoot's in the cave ahead. Ali's on the other side of this wall. Hoo-ee. This was some cave-in. You're lucky you weren't hurt. I hope your friend was as lucky. Do you think you can help me dig out? Sure. I'll give it a try. Where there's a will, there's a way, you know? (STRAINING) Or a pulled muscle. (SNARLING) Relax, Dil. It's me, Ichy. Ichy? You know I don't see so good. Why do you sneak up on me like that? Eh, call it a mean streak. Well, did you see anything to eat? Nah, not a thing since those baby long necks. Ichy, I'm hungry. You're hungry? What about me? I do all the real work around here. You? I get all the food. Well, you couldn't get it without me. I'm the eyes. So? I'm the teeth! (SNARLS) Aw, who needs you?

Shh! Quiet! It's one of the baby long necks. Something tells me supper is soon. (BOTH STRAINING) (SIGHS) Hmph! It's no use. We'll never be able to dig through all this. We need more help. ALI: Littlefoot! GROUP: Littlefoot! Archie! It's my friends! We've got to hurry. He might be hurt. Me get Littlefoot out! (GRUNTING) (SCREAMS) Oh, heavy. (RUMBLING) (SCREAMING) (ALL SCREAMING) Sounds like a rock slide. Don't worry, kid. I take that back. Worry. Straight ahead till dinner, Dil. (SNARLING) Run! Hide! (GASPING) Archie? Archie! I can't leave the kid out there alone. (SNARLING) Littlefoot. Archie. We have to hide. Follow me. (SNARLING) In there, kid. But what about you? Don't worry. Now you see me... Now you don't. (SNARLING) (GASPS) Where did he go, Ichy? Where did he go? There, in that crevice. (SNARLING) (SCREAMS) (GASPS) Yeah, yeah. That's using your tail! (SQUAWKS) Watch it! Eee-yah! Dil, look out! (SIGHS) Ow! I hate it when that happens. Oh, no. It feels like another earthshake. (DIL SNARLING) And it mad. (DIL SNARLING) Very, very mad. What we do now? Littlefoot in big trouble. CERA: Then what is everyone standing around for? ALL: Cera! Are we gonna save Littlefoot or not? ALL: Yay! (GRUNTING) ALL: Yay, Cera! Can I help, Cera? Sure. Stay out of my way. (GASPS) (SNARLING) DIL: I know he's here somewhere. I see him, Ichy! I see him! Congratulations. Now sic him and remember to leave me some! (GROWLS) Back off, belly dragger! Huh? The kid's a snack. I'm a meal. Yeah? Well, I call you the first course. Tenderize him, Dil. (GROWLS) (BOTH SCREAMING) (GROWLS) Grr! (BOTH EXCLAIMING) Cera! Petrie! Ducky! Spike! You're all right! Me miss you! Oh, Littlefoot! How did you know where to find me? Ali came and got us. She did. Thanks, Ali. I was afraid that maybe something bad happened to you. I'm sure glad you're okay. Hmph! (SIGHS) ARCHIE: Hello. We got to get moving before that big-mouthed belly dragger and her sharp-beaked friend wake up. ALL: Who's he? I'll explain later. Now come on. And then the big-mouthed belly dragger and the sharp-beak were just about to have Archie and me for dinner when you guys came to the rescue. You mean I came to the rescue. But Ali showed us the way. And you no even come with us at first. So? I still got here, didn't I? (BLOWS) You should have asked your real friends to help you find the night flower in the first place. Night flower? What's this about the night flower? I have to find it to help my Grandpa who's sick. That's why I was in the cave in the first place. I'm going to the Land of Mists to find the night flower. Well, why didn't you say that in the first place? I know a shortcut. LITTLEFOOT: Archie, you did it! Yay! A way out! Thanks, Archie. I was beginning to think we'd never get out of that cave. I want you to take good care of yourself, Littlefoot. You and your friends are awfully young to be out alone. I know. It's just that I have to help my Grandpa. Just do me a favor and stick together. You may be little. But together, you're strong. Don't worry, Archie. We'll stick together. Yup, yup, yup. We will. Hmph! Good-bye, kids. Good luck. ALL: Good-bye, Archie. Good-bye. Good-bye! Littlefoot, come and see. Wow! DUCKY: Pretty. Is... Is this it, Ali? ALI: Yes, Littlefoot. The Valley of Mists. Stay close. If you get lost in the mists, you stay lost. (TEETH CHATTERING) Do not be afraid, Petrie. I am here. Me not afraid. Me terrified. How long until we find the night flower, Ali? ALI: Not long now. (CREATURE HOOTING) (RATTLING) (GASPS) (SCREAMS) LITTLEFOOT: What is it, Cera? Something slimy touched me. LITTLEFOOT: Cera! (CERA SHRIEKING) She disappeared. Oh, poor, poor Cera! We'll find you, Cera! Don't worry! Okay! Just hurry. (EERIE GROWLING IN DISTANCE) Please. There she is! (ALL SCREAMING) ALI: Duck! Look out! (ROARING) (GASPS) (SCREAMING) (ROARING) (ROARING) Oh, me get headache just watching. Come on! We've gotta find Cera! LITTLEFOOT: There's a tree we can hide under! I do not like it here. Oh, no, no, no, no. (CREATURES CHITTERING) (GASPS) What's that? I think it my teeth. (TEETH CHATTERING) Or knees. (CHITTERING) (SQUEALS) (SCREAMS) (ALL SCREAMING) (SNIFFING) PETRIE: This no time to eat! (SNIFFING) (SNEEZES) (LAUGHS) He does not look scary to me. (GIGGLES) Oh, no, no, no, no, no. He is cute. He is. He has tickly fuzzies all over him. I'm gonna call you Tickles. I am. (SQUEAKING HAPPILY) Tickles, have you seen our friend, Cera? She's a three-horn. (CHATTERS) PETRIE: Petrie take look. LITTLEFOOT: I think she sees her! Me see her, too! ALI: Over here! LITTLEFOOT: Over here, Cera! DUCKY: Cera! I see you! Hee! (SCREAMING) I can't see! (SCREAMS) (GASPS) Help! Hang on, Cera!

I thought it tasted funny. Ow! You hit me! I didn't. Though it's not a bad idea. (EXCLAIMS) What did you do that for? Do what? That. Oh, it's those rotten little edibles. (GASPS) (SCREAMING) You guys keep them busy. I'll save Cera. Ali, no. It's too steep. You'll fall! Don't worry! I... (SCREAMING) How nice. Dessert. Head for shore, Dil. My sweet tooth calls. But, Ichy, you know the routine. Dinner first, then dessert. What are you? My mother? Come on! LITTLEFOOT: Ali! DUCKY: Watch out! PETRIE: Wake up! (MOANS) (GROWLS) (MOANS) (GASPS) Ow!

You're dreaming. Now be quiet! You be quiet! Oh, yeah? Well, you're the one with the big mouth! Oh, yeah? I oughta... ICHY: La, la, la! I can't hear you! (SIGHS) CERA: Thanks, Ali. You're welcome. Hey, guys! You don't have to worry anymore! Ali and me are friends! ALL: Yay! ALI: So you see, with my herd moving around so much, I never got to know anyone but other long necks. Aw...

(SHRIEKING) Not so close next time, lumphead. (GROWLS) Now look what you've done. How are you gonna fix this? (GROWLING) No, Dil! It's all right! (SCREAMING) No! DIL: Ichy, we've been looking for these kids for hours. How about resting the eyes? (YAWNING) You're right, Dil. You keep going while I take a little snooze. But, but... Hey! Hey! Who is the eyes around here? Ichy, you know I can't see. Yeah. But if you keep moving, we're bound to bump into something sooner or later. Good night. One of these... (GRUNTS) Days, Ichy... (GRUNTS) One of these... Oh! Oh, forget it. (GROANS) (CRASHING) When are we gonna get there? My feet hurt. And I'm hungry. I know, Cera. But we have to keep going. We have to find the night flowers for my Grandpa. We are almost there, aren't we, Ali? I think so. See, I've never really seen the flowers for myself before. You haven't? Oh... (YAWNING) I'm very, very tired. I am. (YAWNING) Maybe we should rest for a while. (YAWNING) (SIGHS) (SIGHS) Huh? I do not need a bath, Mama. Hmm. How pretty. A golden flower. Golden flower! Spike, it is the night flower! It is! It is! Wake up! Wake up! We were looking for the night flowers! But the night flowers found us! (GIGGLES) (ALL GASPING) We found 'em, Grandpa! (ALL EXCLAIMING) (ALL CHEERING) If we keep on like this, we can make it home by morning. Surprise! (GASPS) You're not going anywhere but the inside of our stomachs! Right, Dil? (GROWLING) (ALL SCREAMING) They're hiding here somewhere. And I bet it's behind that boulder. What boulder? Never mind. Just stay close to me. I'll flush them out and you nab 'em. (GROWLS) Shh! (ALL SCREAMING) Lookie what I got, Dil. (SNARLING) Hey, what'd you do that for? Because this skimpy snack is barely enough for me. (GROWLING) DIL: You are so selfish! (WHISPERING) What do we do? (SQUEAKING) I am not! ICHY: You're the one who's selfish. He's mine. And that's final! (CRUNCH) (GASPS) (SPUTTERS) Blech! Dil, I didn't mean it! (DIL GROWLING) Honest, it wasn't me. (CERA CHUCKLING) Oops! It's them! They're over there! (GROWLING) (ALL SCREAMING) LITTLEFOOT: Stick together, everybody. Oh, no! Come back, flower. We must stick together. (GASPS) (SCREAMING) Ducky! (SCREAMING) (ALL GASPING) Me save you, Ducky! Petrie! Get away! Go on! Leave me alone! Let go! (PETRIE STRAINING) (PETRIE SCREAMING) (DUCKY SCREAMING) (ALL GASPING) No! Ducky! Ducky! Oh, no. (GASPS) Put my friend down! (LOUD SNARL) Whoa! You got her, Dil! I did? Then she's mine! Ducky! Wake up! Look out! Ducky! ALL: Ducky! (STRAINING) Duck... Duck... Ducky! (ALL GASPING) Huh? (GASPS) Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh... We gotta do something! Come on! You're next, my little diet delights. (CHUCKLING) (ICHY SHRIEKING) Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! (ICHY SCREAMING) ICHY: Don't swallow, Dil! It's me, Ichy. Ichy? Open up, you idiot! (GASPS) You almost ate me. But it was an accident, Ichy. I didn't see you. Of course you didn't see me. You can't see your own nose at the end of your face. You're useless! Useless? Without me, you'd starve! I would not. You would too. Would not. Would too. Would not, would not, would not! Would too, would too, would too! That's it, Dil. I've had it with you, Ichy! From now on... I'm going it alone! I'm going it alone! No! (SCREAMING) That'll teach him. Huh? Who's there? (ROARING) (SCREAMING) Ichy! Ducky! Are you all right? I think so. But I thought I heard Spike talk. He did, Ducky. Spike talked! (SIGHS) Oh, Spike, I'm so happy! You talk-ded! Yup, yup, yup! You did! Are you sure you don't want to come with us, Tickles? (SQUEAKING) Do you think we'll ever see him again, Ali? I hope so. The land is changing. Maybe we'll all live together someday. ALL: Bye! Bye! Good-bye! ALL: Good-bye, Tickles! Good-bye! Bye, Tickles! Bye... We're home. Yeah. I hope my Grandpa's still... Come on, Littlefoot. We should hurry. LITTLEFOOT: Grandma? Littlefoot! We brought the night flowers, Grandma. Oh, Littlefoot. Is... Is Grandpa... Okay? He's so weak. Don't worry, Grandma. The night flowers will make him well again. The Old One said so. I hope she was right. And I hope it's not too late. Come on! Let's hurry. (GROWLING WEAKLY) He ate as much as he could. Now, all we can do is wait. Littlefoot? Grandpa? Well, hello there, Littlefoot. Hello yourself, Grandpa. GRANDMA: How are you feeling, dear? Oh, much better. I think Littlefoot's golden flowers are working. Does that mean Grandma and I won't be leaving the Great Valley after all? That's right. Littlefoot? He's all right! My Grandpa's gonna be all right! (ALL CHEERING) PETRIE: Good, Littlefoot! (GASPS) Me think me should be going now. (GASPS) You are right, Petrie. Our mamas and daddies are probably very worried. ALL: Bye! Bye... OLD ONE: Listen up, everyone. We will be leaving in just a few moments. Good-bye, Littlefoot. I know we will meet again someday. I know we will, too. Thanks for being my friend, Cera. Oh... Hee. Good-bye, Petrie. I'm gonna miss you a whole lot, too. Aw, gee. I'll miss you and Spike, too, Ducky. And we will miss you very, very much, we will. But Spike talks now. So he can tell you for himself. Go on, little brother. ALL: Yeah, Spike! Say something! Go on, talk. Come on, Spike... (MUNCHING) Yep, yep, yep! Spike can talk... When he wants to. (CHUCKLES) (ALL LAUGHING) Well, good-bye. ALL: Good-bye! ALI: (ECHOING) Maybe we'll all live together someday... NARRATOR: And so it came to pass that the migrating dinosaurs left the Great Valley for lands unknown. And yes, Littlefoot, and his friends, Cera, Ducky, Petrie, and Spike, would indeed meet Ali again one day. But that's another story.
