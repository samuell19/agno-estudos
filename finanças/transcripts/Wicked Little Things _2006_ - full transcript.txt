CARLTON: Bull Foreman! Bull Foreman! Get these little immigrant bastards on their feet. We've got two hours of daylight left. BULL: You heard Mr. Carlton. You got two hours. (BOYS GRUNTING) (SHOVELS CLANKING) I need a small one. You. What's your name? Mary. Down! (BIRD CHIRPING) Just get in there, and don't think about it. (MARY GRUNTING) (RUMBLING) Just leave the sticks and back out now. (RUMBLING) Mary! Come on! Get out here! BULL: Old Man Carlton wants this section open. Now light it up! She's just a child. You want to be out on your ass? (CHILDREN GROANING) (CHILDREN SHOUTING) (CHILDREN SCREAMING) (CHANGING CHANNELS ON CAR RADIO) KAREN: Sarah, stop it. Okay, it's enough, Sarah. God, you've been fudging with the radio for like an hour now. You can say "fuck," Mom. I've heard it before. Mommy, how much longer? Soon, Emma. Very, very soon. You said that like an hour ago. Okay, so we're going to stop up here in Addytown and get some supplies, and then the house is not far up the mountain from there. EMMA: Can I get a candy bar, Mom? Please, Mom, just one. Please? (CHUCKLES) Do you want anything, Sarah? Yeah, to go home. Will that be all, ma'am? Yeah, and the candy bar. WALTER: $32.1 8. On the house, little one. These pictures are kind of creepy. Easy to get lost in these woods. Might I ask what you're doing up in these hills? Oh. We're moving here. To Addy? No, little further up. Carlton? My husband... My late husband was a Tunny. Did you know them? WALTER: I know the house. Ain't been no Tunnys around here in years, though. Yeah, I think my husband was one of the last. But we inherited the house, so... We don't make deliveries up there. Okay. I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Walter. Walter, I'm Karen. What's your name, little one? Emma. And this is Sarah. Let's get out of here before it gets dark. These woods creep me out. Well, thank you, Walter. It was very nice to meet you. I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot of you. You bet. Bye, Emma. What's that movie called about the guy who gets his head chopped off? Why did he get his head chopped off? Stop scaring Emma. Yeah, Johnny Depp was in it. That's what this looks like. Like we're in the fricking legend of Sleepy Hollow. (CAR HORN HONKING) (TIRES SQUEALING) - Asshole! - Asshole. (CHUCKLES) Hey, Emma, it's not funny. (EMMA SCREAMING) (TIRES SQUEALING) (GASPING) Jesus, Mom, you almost killed us! Is everyone okay? Yeah, except for the fact that I almost pissed my pants! - Mom, where are you going? - Just stay here. Hello? Hello! Where did he go? KAREN: I don't know. He just disappeared. That's got to be it. You cannot be serious. Is this where we're going to live, Mom? For a while, baby. There's no way I'm living here. Mom, it's a wreck. We're in the middle of nowhere. Quit your bitching. Hmm? What's that on the door? What is it, Mom? I don't know, baby. It looks like paint or something. Looks like blood to me. Why would it be blood? (SIGHS) It's not blood. Give it a rest. Lock's broken. That's reassuring. (SWITCH CLICKING) KAREN: Great, no electricity. Wow, it's big. It's bigger than our other house! I wanna see my room! Be careful, Emma! SARAH: This place is filthy. I wonder how old that Christmas tree is. At least they had a Christmas. Why don't we get everything out of the car, you know, before it gets dark? I'm going to go look for the breaker box. Why don't you see if the water's turned on yet, okay? Fine. (GRUNTS) (PIPES RATTLING) Figures. (POWERING ON) (RATS SQUEAKING) - There's fricking rats! - (KAREN GASPS) One just tried to rip my throat out. (BULB SHATTERS) Mom! (EMMA SHUDDERING) What if the rat comes back? He won't. EMMA: But what if he does? Then we'll chop him up and feed him to the monster. What monster? Would you please stop scaring your sister? I wanna go home. This is our home. At least until I can figure out what to do with it. This is not home. This is Dad's bad joke on us. (VOICE BREAKING) Don't do this, Sarah. Not now. Because I can't handle it. What happened wasn't his fault. He loved you. He loved all of us. (SNIFFLES) I'm sorry, Mom. Hey, you guys? I know this has been really tough on all of us. What we're going to do is work together, and we'll get through it. - Right, Emma? - Right! - Right? - Right. EMMA: I like sleeping together. KAREN: Well, it's just for tonight, because tomorrow morning we're going to clean up this place and then you guys are going to each have your own room. That's something you've never had before, huh? What about school? KAREN: There's one in Addytown. I talked to them. You can start late, you know, after we get settled in and everything. With a bunch of demented mountain hicks? Uh-huh. (CHUCKLES) - Mom! - Good night. (FLOOR CREAKING) (GASPS) (PANTING) (SIGHS IN RELIEF) (DOOR CREAKING) HAROLD: I might have to check these pipes down in the basement, miss. The real estate agent promised that everything would be working. Well, I didn't get the call till last evening to come up here. This is so frustrating. I found out yesterday that we don't have phone service, and, of course, my cell phone isn't working. Sarah! I'm surprised they even turned on the electric for you. - SARAH: What? - I need you to run down to that store that we stopped at on the way up here and get as much from this list as you can. (SPEAKING FRENCH) Mom, look at me. I have not taken a shower in two days. I'm not going anywhere in public. I'll let you drive the car. Uh-uh. To the store and back. Take it slow. - Thank you. - Hey! - SARAH: Shut up! - Butthead. Doesn't look like this thing's been working for years. At least no water's been run through it. - Ma'am, let me ask you something. - Mmm? Why would you move up here to these mountains? It's really no place to live. My husband passed away. Oh. Sorry to hear that. It was a long illness and a lot of money. We didn't have much to start with. So, after it was over, then all that was left was this old family house. I was hoping to fix it... HAROLD: Yeah. Who are these children? What? These... Who are these children? Oh. There was some kids. It was years ago. They used to work up at the Carlton mine. - (KAREN SIGHS) - What am I supposed to do with this thing? Who is this? What? The man. Ah! Edmund Carlton. (SIGHS) He used to own this whole mountain and everybody on it. You know, you're gonna have to replace all these pipes. How long is that going to take? HAROLD: Shouldn't take too long, but I'll... I'll be out of here by nightfall. That's for sure. (CHILDREN LAUGHING) KAREN: How many families are left up here? Well, there's Aaron Hanks. I still see him down in Addy every once in a while. Then, of course, there's the last of the Carltons, who... He doesn't live up here, but he's been coming around, buying up all the property... Maybe he'd wanna buy this place. HAROLD: Maybe. I know he's going to tear down the Carlton mansion. Make a hotel out of it. It's right down the road from you. - (PLATE SHATTERING) - Here, this looks good. You okay, Emma? Well, I'm gonna check on my daughter. Do you need anything, Mr. Thompson? Maybe like a drink or something? No, no, I'm fine. Emma! Gross. Go! Get out of here! Go! Go! Go! (SHUDDERS) Emma, honey, where are you? Emma. Emma, where are you? Answer me! Emma! Mr. Thompson! I'll be right back! Emma! WALTER: How long you planning on staying? Not long, I hope. Mom's selling the place. She wants to move to California. I've never been to California. I hear it's warm. The nights are cold here. Stay inside if I was you. Out of the woods. Don't wanna get lost. SARAH: Thank you. Freak. Whose little girl are you? Definitely not yours. (BOTH LAUGHING) Play hard to get, huh? I got something hard for you to get. Stop it. In your dreams. (SCOFFS) (TIM CALLING) What's your name? Sarah. I'm Tim. The idiot's Sean, and that's Lisa. Hi. Where do you live? Up in the hills. SEAN: You're shitting me. Up with the fucking zombies? (LAUGHS) What zombies? (VOICES WHISPERING) (CHILDREN LAUGHING) Emma! Please answer me! (HUMMING) BOY: (WHISPERING) She's coming. She's coming. (VOICES WHISPERING) (GROANS) (CHILDREN LAUGHING) Hello? My name is Emma. What's your name? Emma! (FLIES BUZZING) Emma! I'm scared to come in there. Why can't you come out here? Are you still there? KAREN: Emma! Don't you ever do that again! Just wandering off like that, you scared me half to death! - You're hurting me, Mommy. - Look at you. - What happened to your knee? - I fell. Emma, what are you doing out here? I'm looking for Mary. She lives in there. (GASPING) Okay, I don't want you to ever come out here again. Do you understand me, Emma? Never ever. - Mom! - Never. Cross your heart. Okay. (SOBS) Oh, baby. Okay, come on, let me get you home. (CHANTING PRAYERS) Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Mommy, are we lost? We've been walking for a really long time. No, baby. We're just a little turned around. (CHILDREN CHATTERING) It's okay. Just the wind. Nothing to be afraid of. I'm not. It's just Mary and the others. Come on. (WHISTLING) - (HAROLD EXCLAIMS) - (TIRES SQUEALING) Oh, dumb, dumb. Stupid... (GRUMBLING) Shit, what am I gonna do? Now what happened? What the hell? This is not what I wanted to be doing. No! (GROANING) (HAROLD SCREAMING) Mommy? I'm getting cold and tired. I know, baby. (PIGS GRUNTING) EMMA: Who lives here? KAREN: I don't know, but maybe they can help us find our way home. There's the paint again, Mom. Hello? I don't like it here, Mom. Me neither, baby. Let's go. (GASPS) Oh, God! (PANTING) I'm sorry, you... (STAMMERING) We were lost, and your door was open. Are you the Tunny widow? Yes. My name is Hanks. You hurt yourself, little girl? I fell. Been down by the old mine, have you? You should not let her play down by the old mine. And you shouldn't be out after dark, neither. Well, I didn't let her play down there, and I told you we got lost on our way home. Yeah, well, you just follow the old two-track down the mountain. Runs right by your place. Okay. Thank you. Sorry again for the intrusion. I'll watch your doors for you. (CHUCKLES) I beg your pardon? In the day, come back, we'll talk then. Emma, stay here for a second. Was that you who put the blood on our door? No need to thank me. Ought to last you a while. (SCOFFS) Look, I don't mean to be rude, Mr. Hanks, and I know that places like this have certain customs and all, but I would appreciate it if you didn't do what you did last night. Like I said, no need to thank me. Now get on home now, quick. Come back in the daylight. We'll talk. This Mr. Hanks guy sounds like a freak. I liked him. You would. Mary likes him, too. SARAH: Who's Mary? EMMA: My new friend. I met her in the forest. Like Frizzy, huh? Frizzy wasn't real. Mary is. Right. Maybe she's one of the zombies. The guys I met said they're ghosts of children who were buried in an old mine up here. They roam the woods at night and eat little girls like you. Okay, that's enough. (CAR HORN HONKING) - Gotta go. - What, they're not going to come inside? Please, Mom. They're cool. Where are you going? (SIGHS) To Addytown, to see a movie or something. Okay. Be home early. - What's early? - Like an hour and a half. - Mom! - (LAUGHS) I'm kidding. 1 1:00. - I mean it, okay? - Okay. EMMA: What's a zombie, Mom? It's nothing. Finish your dinner. (EXHALES) Good night, baby. Sleep tight. Mom, if Mary came here to play, would that be all right? Well, I don't think she will, honey. But if she did, would it? Sure. But you have to promise me to never go near that mine again, okay? Promise, love you. (CHUCKLES) I love you more. The zombies won't eat me, Mom. No, but I might. (KAREN GROWLING) Okay, now you have got to go to sleep. Sweet dreams. SARAH: The guys I met said they're ghosts of children who were buried in an old mine up here. (CHILDREN WHISPERING) Emma? (BOY SNIFFING) (ROCK MUSIC BLARING ON STEREO) These woods kind of creep me out. The land of the zombie miner geeks. Flesh-eating kids of Carlton. Stop it, you jerk-off. It's just urban legend bullshit. - (SARAH COUGHS) - (TIM LAUGHS) I got to piss bad. (ALL LAUGHING) So, how come you're not in school? (SIGHS) My mother has to get her shit together first. She sort of had a nervous freak out after it all happened. Were you close to your dad? Yeah. Real close. I miss him a lot. (URINATING) (SEAN SCREAMS) - SEAN: Fuck. - (TIM LAUGHING) You scared the shit out of me, man! Wasn't fucking funny. Fuck. Come on, guys! We got to get her home by 1 1:00! (CREAKING) (GASPS) Sarah? Sarah! (DOOR CREAKING) Damn it. (PIGS SNORTING) Come on, sugar. We got God's work to do. (PIGS SQUEALING) (PIG GRUNTING) (SNORTS) (PIG SQUEALING) See you tomorrow? Yeah. I mean, sure. Look, Tim, thank you... I got to go. See you tomorrow. - Bye. - Bye. Bye. Did you have a good time? Yeah, I did. It was nice. What's wrong? (SIGHS) I found some old photographs of your father and his family in the basement. Wow. Look how young he was. (KAREN CHUCKLES) How old were you guys when you first met? We were 1 6. Then I got married at 1 7. I had you at 1 8. Fast worker, huh? (KAREN CHUCKLES) KAREN: Mmm-hmm. It must be weird to find all this stuff about his family. Yeah. (SIGHS) I didn't really know anything about them. You know what he was like every time we brought it up, I mean, he just refused to talk about them. I didn't even know they lived in Pennsylvania until I found the deed for this house in his papers. It's like they were this secret. (PIPE RATTLING) Mom! The water stopped working! I'll check on it! Thank you. Oh, God. (PANTING) WALTER: Harold ain't answering his phone. Must be out on a job. KAREN: You guys have to have another plumber somewhere, right? WALTER: There's one down in Hemet. KAREN: Okay. Let me see if I can find his number. - He's more expensive. - KAREN: I don't even care. I need what's on this list. Put it all on my account. - Excuse me. - WILLIAM: I'll be back after lunch. Have it ready then. I was kind of in the middle of something... (SCOFFING) Who the hell was that rude bastard? William Carlton. KAREN: He lives here? WALTER: No. The old Carlton mansion's in ruins. He's up here surveying the land. Gonna build a fancy ski resort. Huh. You okay, Emma? You seem quiet today. Mary said she wouldn't hurt you, but she doesn't know about the others. When did you see Mary again? Last night. She stayed in my room. She likes to sleep in my bed. It used to be hers. KAREN: When I made her bed, there was this spot on the mattress. I mean, it looks like someone was sleeping here before we came. SARAH: So what are you saying? This Mary chick is not another one of Miss Weirdo's imaginary friends, like Frizzy? And she actually lives in the mines with the other zombie freaks? (SIGHS) I know, it's crazy. I don't even know what I'm saying anymore. (SCOFFS) Hell, I don't even know what I'm doing half the time. (SIGHS) SARAH: God, I keep on forgetting. The water doesn't work again. I can't believe the stupid plumber can't come until tomorrow. Quit your whining. At least you got a bath today. Half a bath, Mother. Honey? Are you okay? Mary doesn't like to live in there anymore. She wants to come home. (SIGHS) Where did you get the doll? Mary gave it to me. Emma! Stop it. Where did you really find it? I told you! Mary gave it to me, and I gave her Teddy. MAN 1: Yeah! MAN 2: Take a look here! MAN 1: All right, let me grab a flashlight! Sarah! (MEN CHATTERING IN THE DISTANCE) Sarah! What? Watch your sister. I'll be right back. MAN 1: We're going to have to blow out the interior on that. MAN 2: Take a look at those plans again. MAN 1: I'll get them. KAREN: Hello? Is anybody here? (FLIES BUZZING) (RETCHING) Mr. Carlton? (RATTLES) Hello. (GASPS) Oh, I'm sorry, I was... I heard voices. And? And I was told the Carlton home was around here. And? And I was wondering if it was you. Well, now you know. This is private land. You're not supposed to be here. My name is Karen Tunny. I live nearby. - The old Tunny place, huh? - Yeah. WILLIAM: I'll give you two weeks to vacate it. (LAUGHS) So you wanna buy it? I already own it. I own everything from here to Addytown. No, I own it. I inherited it. I have a deed. You have a miner's deed, a lease. All rights to the land are mine. Everything on it. Animal, mineral, wood, brick, mine. I'll give you and the others two weeks to clear out. You can tell Hanks to stop this nonsense with the dead animals. He doesn't scare anyone with his old stories. If I catch him doing it again, I'll have him arrested. Russel, let's go. (CAR ENGINE STARTING) HANKS: He's right. (PIGS GRUNTING) He owns it all. How can that be? Just is. Well, we'll get lawyers, and we'll fight it. Suit yourself. The only way you're going to get title is if he dies. He's last in the Carlton line. He dies and the land goes to the miner's deed. That's how it works. There was a dead pig. A carcass. He said you did it. Every night they come for redemption. For his blood. The evil he did made them what they are, and they hunger. What if we have to move like this guy says? We won't, don't worry. This is our home and no one can make us move. (SIGHS) (CAR HORN HONKING) I won't go out tonight if you don't want me to. Oh, no, baby, go out. Have fun with your friends in Addytown. Thanks, Mom. - Love you. - Love you, too. Oh, my God. WILLIAM: We're going into Addytown. We'll be back in a few hours. See you then. Where have I seen you before? (ROCK MUSIC BLARING ON STEREO) LISA: It's a major bummer if that fucker kicks you out. I was just starting to like you, bitch. Mmm. Turn it up. I love that song. (VOLUME INCREASES) (LAUGHS) (MUSIC BLARING IN THE DISTANCE) (SIGHS) Lt can't be. (CHILDREN LAUGHING) Mr. Carlton? Is that you, Russel? What the hell are you two doing... (GROANS) (CREAKING) What the hell was that? It's just the wind. (CHILDREN LAUGHING) I don't hear any wind. Me, neither. (CREAKING) (LISA GASPS) Holy shit! Let's get the fuck out of here. - It's nothing. - Look, I'll prove it. No! Would you fucking chill? LISA: Close the damn door! If you ever want to get in my pants again, you better start the car and get my ass out of here right now! (CHUCKLES) Sean, do you hear me? Sean! - (SEAN SCREAMS) - (LISA SHRIEKS) - (SEAN LAUGHING) - LISA: You asshole! (ALL LAUGHING) Got you. Not funny, Sean. Would you get in here and let's go? He's such a dick. You're freaking the girls out! I'm going to leave your ass, I mean it. Start the engine. He's probably just pissing again. - I don't care. - (CAR ENGINE STARTING) Take off and make him come running. (CAR REVVING) God damn it! What's wrong? We're stuck. Come on, Sean, we got to dig the bird out! Give it some gas when I push it! You know I can't drive! I can! Okay! Now! (CAR REVVING) (GRUNTS) Shit! It's not working! Again! (CAR REVVING) Fuck! Fuck! Come on, Sean! BOTH: Tim. Tim! (SCREAMING) - Tim! - Tim! Tim! (SCREAMING) Tim! Tim! Go! Go! Go! (BOTH SCREAMING) No! No! (GASPING) Lisa! (CRYING) It's not happening! It didn't happen! Lt didn't happen! It fucking didn't happen! Mom! - Sarah, what happened? - Mom, they're for real! - What're you talking about? Who's for real? - The fucking children! - Stop it, Sarah. I am sick of... - Mom! It's not fucking urban legend. We have to get out of here now! - Lt was so horrible. - KAREN: Emma! How can they be for real? How could they be alive, Mom? - We have to get out of here! - I am not going anywhere without Emma! - Emma? - SARAH: Emma! KAREN: Emma! Emma! SARAH: (CRYING) They're out here, Mom. KAREN: So is Emma. Where are we going? Back to the mine. That's where I found her the first time, and it's where she met Mary. That's who gave Emma the doll. I saw her photo in one of the family albums, and her and her brother Ryan were Tunnys. They were two of the kids that were buried in the mine accident. (SOBBING) How did this happen? How can it be for real? I don't know. There has to be some explanation, but I don't know. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb... KAREN: Emma! Jesus. SARAH: Emma! KAREN: Emma? Emma! SARAH: Emma! (SOBBING) They could be anywhere out here. Maybe we should go back and get some help. I am not leaving my baby out here! Mom, this is insane! (CRYING) You can't believe what they did. They had these hammers and picks and... KAREN: It's gonna be okay! (CRYING) We are going to get out of this! I'm sorry. Look, we're just going to find your sister. Okay? And everything's going to be okay. Emma! (GASPING NERVOUSLY) This is it. This is the creek. It's down this way. Right around here. This is where I found her the first time. We can't go in there. We have to. What if they're in there, Mom? - Then stay here. - No fucking way! KAREN: Emma? It's okay. Emma, are you in here? (KAREN SHUDDERS) Emma! Mom? What if Emma's dead? KAREN: Don't you say that! Don't you ever say that again. She's fine! We're going to... We're going to find her, and everything's going to be fine. Damn it! - Mom, I can hardly see anything! - Just don't move! (SARAH SCREAMING) - What is it? - It's a hand, Mama! It looked like a hand. I swear! (CHILDREN GIGGLING) KAREN: Shit. - Mom? - Shh. (CHILDREN GIGGLING) (SOFTLY) Run. What? Run. Where? With me, run! - Where are we going? - The old man's house is this way! Mom! - Get up! - I can't. - Yes, you can. Get up! - I can't run anymore! Get on your feet and run, Sarah! The road's right up here. (HORN HONKING) Help us! WILLIAM: What the hell do you think you're doing? You almost got yourself killed! SARAH: We need to get out of here. They're after us! Get out of my car, young lady. What the hell do you think you're doing? Just drive and I'll explain! You're getting mud all over my car. Now get out! The children are going to kill us all unless you get out of here! - Now go! - What the hell are you talking about? (ALL SCREAMING) SARAH: Mommy! Go! Who the fuck are those kids? Ask him. RUSSEL: Why are they doing this? They can't be real. They look fucking real enough to me. Hey! Just stop right here! You come any closer, and I'm going to start doing some damage! Son of a bitch. Keep moving! What the fuck do we do now? I can't shoot a kid. They're already dead. Holy shit. (RUSSEL SCREAMS) (BOTH SHRIEKING) (KAREN AND SARAH PANTING) - KAREN: (SOFTLY) Mr. Hanks. - (KNOCK ON DOOR) Are you there, Mr. Hanks? Mr. Hanks. Oh, God. Oh, thank you. How far are they behind you? On the road. (GASPING) What are you doing out at night? I warned you. My Emma, she's gone missing, and I think she's with the one named Mary. If you're lucky, they won't hurt her. Blood they know, blood of their kin. All others are fair game. That's why the blood on the doors, to mark them. We're safe here. No. They're animals. There's no telling what they'll do when you get them riled up and you ain't got Tunny blood. If they haven't killed her already, she'll be back by daylight. They only feed at night. We're all going to die, aren't we? Like I said, depends on how much you got them riled up. They already killed three of my friends. And maybe William Carlton, too. How do you know that? (BANGING ON DOOR) (HANKS SHUSHING) (BANGING CONTINUES) WILLIAM: Let me in. It's him. He's alive. Let him in. Why? Because they'll kill him if you don't. Eye for an eye. You want him dead, don't you? WILLIAM: Hanks? Open the goddamn door, or I will. You open that door, we will die. Open the fucking door! WILLIAM: Hanks? They ate him. From where I was hiding, I could see them tear pieces from him and... You're a pretty thing. You were in my car, weren't you? He's crazy! Hell, yes, I'm crazy! They fucking ate him! HANKS: Shut up! WILLIAM: Mmm. Your truck, does it run? Sometimes. An hour until sunrise. If we can just get to your truck... Don't let them get me. You ain't gonna kill 'em! You ain't even gonna hurt 'em! But you can sure as hell slow them down. Use that thing! They're crazy for him! This ain't gonna stop! Out the front door. You open, and I'll clear the way. - Sarah. - Ready, Mom. Now! Do it now! Go! Get out of here! (PIGS GRUNTING) Well, come on, Mr. Hanks! Shit! (ENGINE STALLING) Son of a bitch! Come on! SARAH: Go! Go! Go! HANKS: Come on! God damn it! (PIGS GRUNTING) (THUNDER CLAPPING) Why are they stopping? Carlton? You come up here, I'll kill you! I'll kill all of you. I mean it! (DOOR RATTLING) Don't move. Not a muscle. You move, and there's no telling what they're gonna do. What's going on down there? Who's down there? It's him they want. If you and your kids want to get out of here alive, you'll let them have him. They'll kill him. As you sow, so shall you reap. (WHIMPERS) Mom. WILLIAM: Hanks? Is that you? (GUN CLICKING) (SCREAMING) (THUDDING) (CRYING) Mom. (CRYING) EMMA: Mom! Emma? Oh, God, Emma. Oh, God, baby. They won't hurt you, Mommy. They won't hurt anyone anymore. They promise. I thought I lost you. I was just playing with Mary. She hasn't had anyone to play with in a very long time. KAREN: Oh, God. SARAH: I still don't understand why we didn't sell the house. How are we going to get the money? Well, we have enough to make it through. At least until I get a job. We're going to be okay, you guys. Promise. SARAH: Do you think anyone's ever going to find out about what really happened? Mr. Hanks took care of all of the loose ends. - Well, I know, but what... - Sarah. A lot of strange things happen up in those hills. People go missing all the time. After a while, everyone will forget about it. Just like the last time. I'm glad we didn't sell the house, Mom. Me, too, baby. Me, too. (SIGHS) (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
