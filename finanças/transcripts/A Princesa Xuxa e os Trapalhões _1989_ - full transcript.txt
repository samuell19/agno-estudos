"PRINCESS XUXA & THE TRAMPS" At the right side of the Milky Way... in a system of twin stars... there was a nice little planet called Antar... that lived in total harmony. Up to the day when Ratan, a conqueror... decided he wanted the planet for himself. Despite the weak efforts by King Jornei... Antariana! I've done my best to avoid the war! Antar's fate was set. However, 3 princes managed to escape... taking with them the little princess Xaron... true heiress to the throne of Antar. Daddy. I want daddy. Your daddy, King Jornei, couldn't join us. Some day you will understand. Let's go. Hide the princess, I gotta do one thing... by myself, I can't stand anymore. It's urgent. Sand! I dried up! I want water. - I want water! - Relax, princess. You'll have water. - I can't! - Don't do it! It's the princess' our queen. - For you, princess. - Just a little bit. It's over. Why didn't I think about it before? What? - My new invention. - What invention? The wafer sniffer. Go find it. Guys, I found water! Water! I found it! It's mine! - It's mine! - I saw it first! It's yours. Zacalim! Who, me? - Come here. - Are you sure? Get down... you invented that... Sush! The little guys. The princess. Throw this away. Let's go, we gotta a lot of walking. Come on, your majesty. It's the fresh water pet! This prince Dedeon is a character... The three princes went on determined... to protect the princess at any cost. But the desert doesn't offer the comfort of palaces. And this is how our story begins. Daddy! Daddy? Daddy? Daddy? My little princess. Your father couldn't come. Ratan will take care of you. Prepare the horses. We're going back home now. Princess, where are you? Water... water and French fries. For God's sake, I want water and French fries. Waiter, a nicely cold beer. A knight? A noble knight! He's hereto save us, guys! Knight? What knight? I see a horse. What? The sun got into you. I see two donkeys... and a flat head in between. Gee! Taxi! It stopped. This is bad. Water. Water! Water! And the French fries? Hey, guys, I don't want to be a spoiler... but that's no water. It's acid rain. - Mister, will this hold? - Who are you? - We are princes. - Is it contagious? No. I'll tell you. You know... we escaped from a great war... and managed to save the princess. Now the princess is gone... and if she falls into Ratan's hand... We're done. We need help. Listen... what's your name again? - Knight Without Name. - This is a name? "Knight" from my father, "Without Name" from my mom. Mr. Without Name... would you please help us? At my hideout we can talk better. But... this is bad, right? 10 NANONS LATER This is how I like traveling thru the desert. - With this temperature. - Don't get excited. Soon the sun will shine and it will get very hot. Do you know what happened on the eastern camp? No. What? The prisoners refused working for Ratan. - What did Ratan do? - I don't know. There's no one left to tell the story. Wait. What's that? Please! I'm dying. Some water, some food... for a poor old woman who could be your mother. Sorry, mom. I'll go and grab something to eat. Bring something for me. You hear me? Where is this guy? Stop. Stop now. Now, get down real slow... so you won't harm yourself, baby. - Down, my queen. - You're surrounded! Mussaim, the Brave, strikes again! - Ouch! My head! - Oh, my God! Take this beast off me! Take it or I'll kill it. You have 24 hours to get the hell outta there. Prince Mussaim, I'll help you. My mechanic punch never fails. It worked. Once again, it's up to me. Damn you! I'm gonna kill you! Thought you could hold us? We're princes. I'm solving a problem here, wait a minute. That was easy. Do whatever you want... I won't say a word! You gonna speak, man. Yes, sir. You gonna speak, man. I'm gonna use my mind power. This food is produced at one camp... by children sentenced to forced labor. It's been taken to the palace... for the mask ball of the princess. - You spoke! - I did not. Gossiper! I'm gonna tell! Forgive me, Ratan! I said nothing, I swear! Guys, we have a mask ball to attend. I'm eager to know the princess. How is she? Blond, brunette, red-haired, what? - Is she beautiful? - Beautiful. Princess. My princess! The party is about to begin, you're not ready? I'm not feeling too well. I'd better stay in my room. There are moments, my dear... when you do not seem happy here. You're wrong, Ratan. Maybe I'm just tired of so many tributes. You do everything to please me. I'd do more if I could, Xaron. Then why don't you take me to know the outside world? What for, darling? Don't you know your world is much better? Besides... before your father got ill... you visited that world. Don't you remember? I was a small child then, Ratan. I remember nothing from that time. You know it. Well, my beauty, as soon as I can... SOON... we'll go together and visit this people... that loves so much princess Xaron. I'll get ready, Ratan. Xaron! Don't forget... it's a mask ball. Let's go, children. Come, nanny. Hey, you! Bring me a liguiron. Double. Vagabond! Ragamuffin! Tramp! Get out of here! You bastards! The password. That's for me, a "passport". - Password! - Man, don't you remember me? From the bar, all that fuss... Password! Dedeon, he wants the password. Password? - Password? - The password? - It's occupied. - It's not that. Without Name? - The password. - Beats me! Smack him. Beats me! Smack him. Beats me! Smack him. Really? Beats me! Smack him. No! Right, this is it. Go ahead. Out of my way, scum! Let the car through. Don't forget, it's a mask ball. Get a costume that won't attract attention. - Leave it to me, I'll remind them. - Right. - Xaron, let's play? - Play? Princess! There's never been in the whole universe... a nanny like you. I am at your service. Let's dance. No, thanks. I'm playing with the children, OK? Come on, children. I see this party is custom made for me. "Customs"? You're not dressed as a smuggler. Where's Lissa? Lissa! Why all this hurry? - Lissa, you OK? - You're the nanny? You have to watch the children. Great nanny. - Sorry, milord. - No, it's not necessary. How about we get cozy in some cellar? I couldn't go. The princess wouldn't like it. I was told she is the most fair woman in Antar. - Who is she? - You were? That one. These guys are liars! So, and the cellar? Any suggestions? I'm a prince. I'll clear for you. - You, a prince? - Sure, a prince. What a boring party, buddy. And this volcano "booz" is not that hot. Got any straws? Geez, boring! - Hi. - Hi. - Do we know each other? - From where? I don't know. Let me think. I know! This story has a castle, king, queen and knight, right? - Then you are... - The fairy. No, the dragon! Here comes Mussaim, guys! You're crazy? Let go! Are you crazy? What do you want? To be found? We're undercover! Wanna die? Let's go. MY daughter! Are you OK? Talk to me. You frightened my pets, you hear? Give my wig back! What size are your shoes? 24. Why? Nothing. You work here for a long time? I live here since I was born, sir. If you didn't work for Ratan... I'd say you were a lucky girl. - Why, sir? - Here there's luxury... wealth, food. While out there, the people starves... oppressed by the evil Ratan. I don't believe he's that evil. - The canon. - What? Forget it. Girl... keep your eyes open around here. Wait a minute. Who are you? A desert prince. Someone without name. Come, Without Name. Everything's ready. Hold it. Well, I'll wait for you at the first cellar. No, wait. Tell me more about Ratan. Soon you'll know more about Ratan... honey. - Let's go. - Hold your horses! Ratan. Yes, you, baby. Sorry, but you're running out of time. Good days will be over. This is ridiculous. This message will destroy itself within 8 seconds. It can't be true. It's a bluff. A bluff! That's what it is! It's a bluff! Bluff! Without Name... did I wake you? Who's there? The blond one? The nanny? Come to me, nanny. Let's get married and have blond kids in the desert. - Let go! - The beast! You come to scare me while I'm asleep? Me, the beast? He's dreaming he's dating the nanny. - It failed again. - Try it again. Mr. Scientist... - Again! - The "booz" will help you. I don't wanna get high, I want fire! Science's guy... Old blue eyes... will you prove the nectar of gods? - What is this? - Good ole "booz". Don't you have something stronger? You don't look like a "boozer' You think this is water? - This sounds like samba. - Samba? - Yeah, old time thing. - Let's get some sleep. Tomorrow we'll have to escape earlier. - Good night, Dedeon. - Good night, Zacalim. - Good night, Mussaim. - Good night, Zacalim. - Good night, Without Name. - Good night. I thought those vermin had died in the desert. I want to kill them with my own hands... like I did with king, remember? And that other? Who was that with them? Nobody knows where he came from, where he lives. How dare you tell me this, you vermin? I told the patrol to get ready. You want them alive, to be tortured? No. I just want their bones. To feed my "catogs". Now remember, Drake... Remember! If you don't bring me those rebels... by tomorrow morning... Things won't remain like this. Thieves, they took all my clothes! Good night, Zacalim. Are you taking long with this thing? - Good night, John Boy. - Good night, Mary Ann. Subversive worms, prepare yourselves. Let's see who went to the punishment oven. Simpleton! Zealot! It was you, huh? Begin the punishment. That's it, squeeze, pinch, bite. More! Yes! This is music to my hears. More! They are less than a hundred f√©rgusos away. Down. Follow me. This time they won't escape. They're gonna regret the day they were born. Follow me. But keep quiet. You, there. I've gotta be fast, before it's too late. What's going on here? Cowards! Come back! - Come back immediately! Stop! - Let's get outta here. Hurry, guys, let's go! Wake up, Mussaim! Wake up, for God's sake! - Wake up! - Quick! You've gotta run! Who are you? If you don't run now, you're gonna be arrested. - Why are you helping us? - You've gotta trust me! By now, we sure do. Come with us. To the horses! Quickly! If we are quick... tomorrow morning we get them. Dedeon, see if they're following us. Right! Geez! They're too near! Thanks God we're close to the hideout. Hell! Where are they? This couldn't have happened. Where are they hiding? They couldn't simply vanish. It's impossible, it can't be. Impossible! What do you say, you useless bunch? Nobody can beat us! I liked you, little guy. This is behind the mirror barricade. Wait. What about him? Funny... Who are you? - The nanny from the castle! - The princess! Honey, remember me? At the party? You like it? Missed me? Guys, the nanny. She missed me. What are you looking for? Bow! The princess! They think you're the princess. - I am. - Of course you are... Princess! Mercy! - She's so beautiful! - She's tall. She's grown a lot. You've grown, since the last time we saw you. - Remember us? - Look at us. What matters is that she's back! She is back! I didn't know there was a place like this. Nobody knows. And to think the whole planet was once like this... it's outrageous! - Tell me more about Antar. - During your father's time... the whole planet was this nice. There was peace, harmony... until your father got careless, so did we... and Ratan took over. Expelled the old people... and put children at forced labor camps. The rest you already know. It's hard to accept these things, but... now we have you with us... maybe things can change. Sir. I have bad news for you. Bad news? The princes and the Knight Without Name escaped. You will be without a name and a head... if you don't bring me those vagrants by tomorrow. One of our warriors followed them. Good for you, Drake. Oh, my treasure. Mussaim, what are you doing up there? Quiet, man. Shut up. Man, I asked what are you doing up there? I'm seeing paradise. Shut your mouth. Without Name, I've seen the paradise. I've seen the paradise! I've seen the paradise! Paradise! I don't get it. Two are gone... the third is up there. I wonder... I know! I can't stare. It's the princess. But I'll stare. There's no one... But... where is she? Please, princess. I saw... I mean, I looked, but I didn't see. - Be careful! - I looked, but I didn't see. - Are you OK? - I didn't stare, princess! Knight... Without Name? Without name? You need a name. - You look like... - From my looks, it's ugly. Diron. I prefer Didi Mocon. - Diron. Deal? - Deal! Diron! You're so handsome! You're wonderful. You're the best. You drive me crazy. Dedeon... am I interrupting something? Princess! It's a honor to have you here. Wanna lay down, sit down? No, thanks. I'm all right. What is it that you want? You know, Dedeon? I've been told you feel no pain. Is that right? Sure. - It's not a tale? - Tale? - Hit me. - What? Hit me. No, I'm gonna hurt you. Hit me. Man, I'm impressed, Dedeon. Thank you very much for this lesson. Good night. Bye. Zacalim! I sot it! I sot it! - Thanks God I got it! - What you got? Look what I did, princess. My greatest invention. The invention of the century. Come and see. Pay attention. - Cute. - Isn't it? It's my mechanical "catog". Isn't he perfect? Too perfect. Look, Zacalim. Bed wetter. Come, I'll show you something... nobody saw up now. You're the first one. Careful with the stones. So nice! This is the "Solarium magnificum". The flower blossoms when our two suns... are on the same quadrant. And this happened a thousand nanons ago. The legend says that when this flower blossoms... it means a new era is about to begin. Oh, Zacalim! Come here. Thank you, Zacalim. Listen, don't forget... good things are to be well kept... they need to be taken care of. Thanks, Zacalim. Kiss, kiss. Bye-bye. Mussaim. I won't hurt you. Easy. What were you doing there? Trying to take this damn... sword. But I can't. What is the fair princess doing here? You know... I'm curious about your name. Why Mussaim, the Brave? Mussaim, the Brave, comes from... my high and noble family. In my adventures throughout Antar... Almost lost my head. ...I even killed a dragon... ...with 12 heads. - 12 heads? What are 12 heads? And with a broken arm. And if it weren't the help... of my dear sword... with and for which... It escaped me. The sword is that one there. Forgive me. The royal sword that out off the 15 heads of the dragon. 15 heads? Wait a minute... I thought you said 12. One head more, one less... I cut them and they multiplied. And weren't you afraid? A brave man never fears. A brave man is always fearless. Mussaim! Look, it's me! I, Mussaim, the Brave, always brave. Very brave. Did I mess up? Princess? I wanted to talk to you. What I'm about to say, I never said to anyone. But I can't stand it any longer. I wanted us to date. You look beautiful. If you were two, you'd be the most beautiful. I'm here for a date with you. What, Diron? What do you think? You know that in this planet it's forbidden... love between a princess and a warrior. But this is just a dream of mine. And dreaming is not a crime in this planet. Nevertheless I can't be in your dream. I tried. I might score. Diron, I could live by your side. But here, it is impossible. What if we went to another planet? Just a "suppository". Maybe in another planet... we find a cozier cellar? Now it's not possible. The people needs us. Everything is impossible here. I live an unfair match, an unreal love. Nothing is impossible. Keep on dreaming. The power of your mind will make things come true. Close your eyes and dream. Close your eyes and dream. Princess. I felt you here. Just as you said. Dream, dream... and it will come true. I want more, princess. No need to ask, my eyes are closed. I want more. Heel you here. You said, dream and it will come true. Princess, please. Did you kiss me? The secret depends on you, Diron. Good night. I don't accept mistakes. Nor failure. Death under the desert suns... will be more pleasant than what is in for you... if I don't get precise news... on the whereabouts of the princess. Understand? Where is Xaron? Guard! Take these pests from here. Put them in the dungeon. Good night, little ones. - Good morning. - Good morning, princess. For you. - For you! - "Thankys"! For you, princess. Why mine is larger? You're the princess. Oh, no. Now everybody is equal here. Let's share it. Oh, God. It started all over again. What started? Danger is over. I couldn't. It failed again. What is this? A weapon I'm developing... to destroy Ratan's cymetric ray canon. - Cymetric ray? - Ratan's canon. Ratan created that weapon... and could rule over the planet. It doesn't allow anyone to get close to the castle. This way it's gonna be hard to tree the children. - There's a way! - Really? What? Someone go to the castle and turn off the canon. Great idea, isn't it? I wanna see how someone will get to the control room... and not be noticed by the guards. I'll go. I turn off the canon... and nobody will notice. If it's decided, let's think of the plan. Where is the rebels' hideout? I don't know, sir. I don't. Let's go. How dare you interrupt me here? Princess! I'm sorry, I can solve the problem... of your father illness. I'm too busy now. Please, leave us alone. My princess! Where have you been all this time? I was like crazy... looking for you at he palace. You wouldn't show me the outside world... ...so I went alone. - You don't say. And what do you think of it, honey? You look ridiculous. I don't wanna talk about it right now, I'm tired. I really don't like this. We have to tree these children. What going on here, huh? Up! Come on. Up! Come one, you burn, up. Hurry! Poor guy. He's beating. Stop hanging out! Come back to work! Are you OK? Eat this. It's good for you. It was hard to get it at the kitchen. - Eat. - What's going on? Give me this fruit. I'm almost out of my patience. Back to work, lazy ones! Up, all of you! Tonight the princess will go to the control room... turn everything off, and we can enter. It's important that she turns off the canon. - Did he say that? - Exactly. I must hurry. Oh, gee... - Have more... - Are you have more? I should be very hurry! Hurry! There's a snake in my room! Sorry, we can't leave our stations. Ratan will know you don't follow my orders. Go! - Yes, princess. - Come on. What do I have to do to turn it off? I know! Twinkle, twinkle little star... Why it's networking? Almost! Mussaim, there's only one soldier. Then it's for you... you're gonna melt the guy. Me? Aren't you Mussaim, the Brave? It's a limit problem. I need more than two. - One is for you. - You're a real chicken! I can only attack more than one. I go. You cover me... 'cause if anything happens to me, you just wait! I'll give a option to you, you must express gratitude. Surprise! One moment, please. Don't come back. Don't come back or I'll punch you. Go! Go there! Look, a plane. I sot him! You're a real killer. Indeed I am. What are you doing? The warrior victory. The great mark. - But I fought! - And I thought. Let's go, they are waiting for us. One, two, three. It's a hit, the death gang. I think I got it. Only two. Shall we? What's up, doc? This is it? We caught some 20 of them. How many? Ten. - Ask more. - How many? - One, but this big... - Guys, look! Take it easy. We're hereto help you. We're here to take you... There's a kid there with a big stone. We're here to take you from this prison OK? What do you think? I don't know. - What do you think? - I trust them. You don't look like a good guy, man. Get off! I don't have time to lose! I knew I was gonna make it. They won't believe this. Princess, we. Princess, are you all right? Say something! I don't know what's going on. Good night! This princess should get married, you know? Look! We're done! Ratan will kill us. I'll inform the guards' quarters. Activate the cannon, quickly! Sir, the cannon is networking. Check with control. They tampered with it. What's going on? Speak, you idiot! The rebels attacked the camp and escaped with the children. This time they've gone too far. How could this happen? It seems the princess helped them. Really? She left through the east gate. Did you put the detector on those dirty rags... she calls an outfit and that she is using lately? Yes, sir. Sure I did. - Prepare the horses. - Yes, sir. And this time, no mistakes. I will command personally... this attack. Easy! Excuse me. Slow, slow. Excuse me. Are you worried with the princess? She will be here. Look! MY love! They're staring. I'm gonna show you a very important thing. - What? - Children, come with me. You stay here, get things ready. Kids, go with him. Zacalim, Mussaim, come with me. Let's go! - Where are we going? - You'll spoil the surprise. Mind the stone. - And? - Oh, that's nice! Please. It's so big! - I can't see the stairs, Diron. - Take easy. MY hand! It's wrong... Something is wrong. - Are we there? - Almost there. - You're beautiful. - You think so? A lot. How did you get in here? We used the other door. I've never seen something like this. - Where did this come from? - From a distant planet. Really far away. They came that far to attack us? On the contrary. This ship came hereto invite us... to go and know their planet. Look at this. Pay attention. This is planet Earth... we are thinking of you. Please, come and visit us someday. What is this? Their inhabitants? Look their war. - This is a weapon. - No, it isn't. Look, how cute. Look! Scratching. Look, this one is having coffee. Look, it should be their kisses. They walk backwards. They must be doing war weapons. No. They look happy. And these ones, who are they? What is this? Oh, this is a nice place. They say it is a very beautiful planet. Don't touch this, kid! Come on, kid! Don't touch it. Don't do this, buddy. Nobody knows what this is. - No! - He's drinking it... He'll drink! Watch what you're doing. Don't touch anything else, boy. Talk to me. Go away. The kid that touches one single thing... - I cut his "little tap". - What if it's a girl? No comments. BOTAFOGO CHAMPION OF 2010 I wished I could know new worlds. And I thought I knew it all. You know our planet looked like that one? Ratan destroyed it all. The only way of going back to normal... is taking Ratan's power. How? Fighting forever? Sure! But Ratan has weapons, and we don't. We do too. We have this. - But this is nothing. - Wanna see? No, Diron. Come on, kids. Let's see if you learned about camouflage. You hide and I and Diron will look for you. Close your eyes and count to ten. One, two, three... three, tour... five, seven... nine, ten... 40, 96, 140... What? We shouldn't talk about this right now. That I am a princess and you're a plebeian? This doesn't matter to me, Diron. Attack! What is it? Something bad is going on at the hideout. Let's go back. Where's the children? What happened here? And the princes? I wonder what Ratan has done with them. Diron! Medalon! What a strange thing he holds there. It is a pity you missed the party. But it's OK. It was so fun... that I'm thinking of another one, at the castle. Princess! But you're the only guest, princess. Don't you even think of not coming. Otherwise, your three little princes... will suffer a lot. What now, Diron? You know I must go. Don't worry, soon we'll be together. Are my noble princes satisfied... with your quarters? You're gonna regret all this, Ratan. Diron will free us and finish you off. And if he doesn't, I will... Mussaim, the "Bravis"! Relax, my friends. After all, why all this courage? What I want more nowadays... is meeting Diron, alone. He wants Diron. I told you that mantle wasn't part of the uniform. When this happens, you clowns... there will be no Diron and none of you. Powerful Ratan, the princess has just arrived. I'm sorry to leave you, noble friends. Don't be sad... we will soon see each other" at the torture room. I think this time we lose, guys. Unbelievable, but tor the first time... I, Mussaim, the Brave, am frightened. - For the first time? - I just remembered... when they searched me, they didn't find... my ultimate invention. - The stone cutter. - Stone cutter? Let's get out of here! Yes! Finally, princess... you made the right decision. I know, at your age we're full of ideals... with lots of illusions. But I also know... that there will be the day when you will see... you are privileged... because you're much more evolved than others. We are privileged, princess... because we deserve. Oh, if you father were alive... ...who knows? - Who knows what? Who knows he would... approve of our marriage. Let's drink to that. Guards! Take her to the dark room... and don't let her out, or you die! You're not thinking of giving up, are you? You only give freedom up when you die. But you're not dead, are you? I don't know. What do you think? No. But we gotta save the princess and the princes. Amanda, they have a canon, weapons... an army, and us? - We have an army too. - What army? Guys! You're right. Together we will win. Diron, I know you will come for me. We're free, guys! Freedom! - Freedom, freedom - Open the wings Didn't I tell you that love wins? Love always wins. What, this is emotion? What? - Dear mother! - Your mother's bones? - No, yours. - Too white... Let's go, it's not my mom. Help! Help! Help! When are you quitting this, huh? Don't worry. What was that? I don't like this. Let's check. Easy, it doesn't hurt to be careful. Who's there? It's a "catog". Must be owned by the children of the castle. Let's catch him and play a bit. - Come. - Come, come, little "catog"... Faster than Indiana Jones. Come, boy. With this uniform, nobody will get suspicious. No, nobody. Diron, I know you will come for me. Careful. Don't touch anything. Diron, I touched there and it moved. Moved? Didn't I say don't touch anything? Sorry. Up, more. Push me more. Almost there. Guys, I'm here! - What do you see? - I'm not sure... but the smell is familiar. Heel freedom is close to us! Up a little more. Pull me! It you think this is it... this gonna be... It already is. Let's split here. Go ahead, do as we planned, OK? The train. There's no train here, man. It Will be OK. Are you OK, Diron? No? Oh, God. It hurts? Here? Where? Here? Talk to me. The mouth? You want water? Food? What to you want, tell me! We must catch Ratan. Ready? One for all, all for one. Aren't you exaggerating a "bitz"? Come! I don't wanna play hide-and-seek anymore. You're under arrest. I made it! My invention works! Mussaim, Dedeon! My invention works, my inven... How's the family, and your dog? Excuse me. I really don't like this. It's too quiet. When Ratan is quiet, he's up to something. I didn't think you were going that far. But since you made it... it's a pleasure to have you here, together. Before Antar's suns rise... you'll be back to the hole where you belong. Ratan! Really, princess? I've heard threats worse than that. Who would do that? You? So this is it? So be it! Now, it's you and me, Knight Without Name. Pity, princess. But you should have chosen a champion... not a poor dancer. Goodbye, knight Without Name. Without name you started, without name you ended. None of this matters to me. Xaron, this is your last chance. Let's forget the past, let's begin again. Let's be the good friends we used to be. What do you say? Coward. Show yourself! I know you are... bastard! Princess, relax. Nobody will hurt you here. This one is for the people, this for the princess... and this one, for me. Your time is over. Now the people will rule. - You OK? - Yes, but I can't see. Diron, he's escaping. - I can't see. - Escaping? You don't really know me... after so many years together. He took the cymetric ray canon. Ratan never escapes, never surrenders. The crystal. It's our salvation. Now, dear friends, you're going to die. It must works! This is your best shot? Looks like a child's game. One more chance! I'm sorry, time's up. Now it's my turn. Go! We made it, Diron! Now I can see. Come one, hurry! Come, brats! Faster. I, princess Xaron, declare that from now on... Antar is free. Drop your guns. And Ratan? What are we gonna do with him? The people will deal with him. Let's put him at the dungeon forever. - What do you think? - We take him to the desert... his punishment will be oblivion. Be it. Let go! I'm a black diamond! Let me go! Let me go! And keep your mouth "shutyz". It was written in the stars... Mussaim, the Brave, strikes again. Unbelievable. I... People of Antar... little people of Antar... today is a happy day. It wouldn't be fair not to reward... those who struggled to make this moment... a reality. Diron. To our brave knight Diron... I give Vera Cruz princedom. Thank you, queen. Stay and rule with me. I can't. I can't live in here. My place is out there. - Then I'll go with you. - You can't, woman. You were born to be queen, I, to be a common person. What about us? Each one has his mission. If your fate has to do with mine... we will meet in some cellar around there, right? No, Diron. Stay. Hooray, freedom! What now? Where am I going alone? Diron, nobody is complete alone. I know my duty is to take care of Antar's people... but like you, I have my dreams. And it's hard to choose between dream and reality. It takes courage to follow the ways of the heart. That's why I chose... to follow with you. Attention, circuit engaged. Prepare to take off. Attention, attention. Taking off. Diron, where are we going? We're going back home. - We're going to planet Earth. - Earth? This planet must be a paradise, right? What is it? Something bad is going on at the hideout. Get the kids, we call... She laughs! CLII! Jesus, I'm so tired... Nothing is impossible. - What you're doing here? - Knowing the casp... Now you can play, have tun. The children, our future, shouldn't forgive... CLII! This is bad. Ratan arrested the children and let go... Let's see if you learned about camouflage. You hide, then you'll find for you... Drake... ...do you love me? - I adore you, Ratan. Thank you. Thank you! Come here! Come here, let me see your wee wee. - Let's change our wig. - I'm a man! - I'm a man! - Nobody's perfect! I'm going crazy! People of Antar, little people of Antar... Long live the princess! THE END
