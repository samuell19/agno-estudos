23.976 English Closed Caption [???] Journey Back to Christmas (2016) Here they are, sir. Okay. Thank you. [???] [wartime fanfare music plays] [newsreel begins] New York pays tribute to the american foot soldier, as the 82nd Airborne division, led by its youthful commander, Major General Gavin, marches up Fifth Avenue. Gliders fly overhead as the City Roars its welcome home to the 13,000 veterans who fought from Sicily and Italy through Normandy, Holland, and Germany. [Crowd cheering and celebrating] ...Four million New Yorkers lined the four-and-a-half-mile parade route to greet the men. Oh, Hanna, I didn't know there would be a newsreel. Oh, it's not your fault. Silly me, I... I just, uh... Here. [Hanna]: I just miss him. Of course you do. Seeing all those soldiers coming home, I just... It breaks me up. 'Course it does. He's your husband. "Was." Aw, Hanna, honey. He's still your husband. Nothing changes that. Well, you know what I mean. He's still in your heart, and you're always gonna be... I'm just making it worse now, aren't I? [Tearfully] Oh... Go on and blow. I've got another one in here. Oh... Look at me, blubbering on. And when all our boys are over there, doing something heroic for the world. Go on and have a good cry. Not everyone's born to change the world. Yeah, well, nothing ever got solved by blubbering on the sidewalk either. I just wanted to make a happy home for my husband. And now I... I don't have any purpose at all. Well... you can walk me to the square. That's not exactly a purpose. [Chuckles] You never know. Even the smallest stone makes a ripple in the water. What stone? It's a saying. Come on, they're decorating the gazebo. Good evening, Mr. McGregor. How's that shoulder holding up these days? Ah, you know, the old rheumatism acts up when there's a storm coming. And I can tell there's a doozy coming in tomorrow. Well, that's what everyone's been saying. It's a shame, too. Cloud cover is going to hide the comet. Oh, darn. I was looking forward to seeing it. I... I didn't think of that. But a big snow storm, it's a good night to nestle in, I guess. And how are you holding up? Oh, don't you go worrying about me. Someone's got to, nurse Hanna. You're always taking care of the rest of us. You'll come to the caroling? Oh. Well, I suppose so. Yes, I always like seeing the whole town come out for it. Let's just hope the snow holds off. [Chuckling] [chuckling] [camera shutter clicks] Julia! You got engaged? Just now! I'm the first to know? Well, of course, you were the one who introduced us. Without you, we never would have-- Oh, Julia! When? Come. Frank's just bursting to tell you himself. ...And I told myself, why wait? As soon as I can carry her over the threshold, we're gonna find the closest justice of the peace. Right, honey? Engaged on the night of the Christmas comet. How romantic. Well, look this way, you two lovebirds. [Camera shutter clicks] And I'm gonna find her a white dress just like one I saw in a window when I was over there in Italy. Prettiest dress I ever saw. Frank has been telling me all about Italy, the good parts anyway. [Chuckling fondly] He says there's hundred-year-old churches and cobblestone streets... Pretty as a picture, some of those towns, but, uh, nothing beats being back home. Well, I should be getting back to work. Congratulations, you two. I'm so happy for you. Hanna? I wasn't even thinking. We were so giddy, and I didn't even-- Oh, no, don't apologize, Julia. We have to keep our eyes focused on tomorrow, right? That's where happiness is, not the past. You are such brave thing. Oh, I'm not so brave. I'm just happy you're so happy. Really. And we are happy. Thanks to you. Comin' through! Hey, uh, we're decorating the tree. You going to come by? Oh. Oh, maybe later, after my rounds. Say, while you're down there, do you mind replacing the key to the storage locker? I forgot to hang it back up. It's right here in my jacket pocket. You're a peach. I gotta run. They're waiting for the decorations. Oh, careful! Uh, see you later? Say yes. We're all going to have a little celebration before heading over to the gazebo. Okay. "...on the left side of her, "she presently spied a little wooden hut "painted blue, and something rose-colored "was tied to the handle of its shut blue door. "'A bunch of roses,' said the fairy godmother, "and she thought of going over and smelling their sweetness, but when she came close to it..." You don't want me to read to you anymore? Are you sad, Toby? I don't want to go back to the orphanage. I bet you don't know what's coming tonight. Do too. Oh, yeah? What? The comet. You are so right. Is the comet a miracle? Hmm. Well, that's a good question. What's the difference between a miracle, and something that just happens? Like, um, rain. Is rain a miracle? Maybe everything is a miracle. Rain, comets... You... Me. It just depends on how you look at it. People are calling this the Christmas comet, but that's not the real name. Oh, yeah? It's the De Vico comet. That's the person who discovered it. I read it in a book. - And you know what? - What? It won't come again until 71 years. - And you know what else? - What? I know a secret. Will you tell me? I think comets are miracles. [Chuckles fondly] Yoo-hoo! We're all waiting for you. Do you mind if I borrow her for a while, Toby? Okay. Don't forget about the comet tonight. Nurse Hanna! You forgot your camera! [Carolers singing upstairs] Do you hear that? Was I right? Doctor Axelrod has such a beautiful voice. He's like an opera singer, just listen. [Singing continues] [laughing] That's Mary Grace. She can never remember the lyrics. She's a riot. Come on. ? ...of comfort and joy ? Comfort and joy... I just want to make a phone call first. Now? It's for Toby. I want to make sure someone from the orphanage takes him home for Christmas. Aw... Poor little boy. I'll be there in a minute, promise. Don't forget, we're all going to the gazebo. ? Deck the halls with boughs of holly-- ? That's my favorite! Hurry! ? Fa-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la... ? ? 'tis the season to be jolly ? ? Fa-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la... ? I'm sorry, the line is out of order. Thanks. ? ...Joy to the world ? The Lord is come ? Let Earth receive her king ? Let every heart prepare him room ? ? And Heaven and nature sing And Heaven and nature sing ? ? And Heaven And Heaven and nature sing... ? [crowd laughing happily] [???] [???] [dog barks outside] [dog barking] Oh... Oh, poor baby, are you cold? Hi! Hi... Aw, poor thing. Let's see. "Ruffin..." Is that your name? Aw, are you lost? You're a ways from home, aren't you? [Woman on phone]: ...and her tone of voice-- Let me tell you, Miss Know-it-All. [Second woman]: It's just a phase. Tina did the same thing-- Excuse me. Hello? I'd like to make a call. ...well, just last week-- - Ruffin! ...she had the gall to say-- Excuse me, can I make a call, please? Is this an emergency? Um, well, no, but-- Well, if it's not an emergency, you're going to have to wait your turn. We'll be off in a jiff. Right. Aw... I know. I tried. I tried... Look at that snow coming down. Your owner must be worried sick. Okay. Come on, you wanna go home? Let's go home. [???] Ruffin? Oh, my gosh! Hal, it's Ruffin! [Gasping in delight] Oh, my goodness, where were you? Thank you so much. Come here, Ruffin! Come here... Oh, please, won't you come in? Oh, thank you. [Still gasping in relief] Oh, Ruffin... Where were you? You bad boy. Aw... She lives for that dog. Honestly, I never knew how much until just now. Right, boy? Gosh, I just, I don't know what we would have done if you hadn't brought him home. You're our hero. Oh, heroes change the world, I just did a simple thing. Well, you saved our Christmas, I can tell you that. Can you imagine how heartbroken we would all be? Christmas without Ruffin? [Child crying] Oh, that's little Clara. I didn't even have the heart to tell her that Ruffin was missing. - [Clara crying] - I'll go. Stay the night, won't you? Oh, no, I-- But the snow is really coming down. Thank you, but I don't live far, just over on Elm Street. But I should be going. You sure that there's no way that we can thank you? You already have. - Merry Christmas. - And to you. - Drive safe. - Will do. Come here, Ruffin, come here. Come here. Come here... [tires squealing] [tires screech and crash] [engine sputtering] Oh, darn. [Tires spinning] [tires spinning] [sighs] [wind gusting] [thunder rumbling] [thunder rumbling, wind rattling] [thunderclap booms] [locked door rattling] What? [Car alarm chirps] [woman]: Hey, wait for me! [Gasping in confusion] Miss, are you okay? Uh... I... I don't... The cars, they're... I... the cars? I don't... this isn't right. Is she okay? I don't know. Miss? Are you lost? No, I don't... I don't... What is happening? I just, I have to get home. Hello? Yeah, there is a woman here who seems lost. Center and main? I don't know what's happening... She's heading north on center. Thank you. Oh, definitely football. Over baseball? - Mm-hmm. - You do not. What, you think you know everything about me? Yeah, I kinda do. I've known you my whole life. Okay, you do not know everything about me. - Oh... - [chuckling] "Man of mystery." Not! So you think. And anything I want to know Louise tells me. Oh, please, shoot me now. Why, hmm? Why am I partners with my little sister's best friend? 'Cause... you trust me. Okay, ma'am, hands on your side of the vehicle-- And I... Make you look good. [Laughs] Can you please be a little less bratty when you're in uniform? [Radio crackles] Dispatch to 403... Yeah, 403. We have a report of a female on main street at center road who may need a well-being check. Can you investigate that? Copy that. En route. [Car engine starting] I... Ruffin? Excuse me... Oh... I'm sorry, forgive me. Excuse me, miss, but are you, uh... Is everything okay? [Stammers in confusion] Can you help me? How long do you think you were unconscious? I don't know. I... I just heard a big, um... ...a big boom. It was thunder, during the storm. Storm? And that's all I remember. Do you think I'm dreaming? You all seem so real, but... Everything, it doesn't... It doesn't seem right. How long were you in the shed before you came out? Just the night. My car got stuck in the snow. Her vital signs are normal. I was reading Ladies Home Journal, and they had a story on dreams once about how they seem like they could be real-- Shh... Just follow the light with your eyes. Have you located the vehicle? No, chief. - Can you tell me the make and model? - Of what? Your car. What kind of car do you have? - A Hudson. - A what? My husband bought it right before the war. I'm not seeing any signs of a concussion. Her vision is fine. No headaches? Mm-mm. And has he been contacted? Your husband? No. He died, in the war. - I'm sorry to hear that. Iraq? - What? Or maybe he was deployed in Afghanistan? France. He was in Malmedy. Mrs. Morse, could you tell us the date? Um, it's December.. 16th. No, 17th. And where are we? What city? Well, Central Falls, of course. - And the name of the president? - Harry S. Truman. Amnesia? Can't be. She knows her name, city, date. Yeah, but there was no storm last night. - Maybe she's pulling a scam? - Possible. Her address doesn't check out, her car doesn't check out. Whatever a "Hudson" is, and she has no I.D. She says she left it back in the shed. That's a likely story. We're going to have to take her in. On what charge? For now, we'll just get some more information from her. It's either that, or a 1701. What, involuntary commitment? Hey, wait, wait, hold on, chief, chief. This all just seems a little bit harsh. It's just procedure, Jake, that's all. Let me take her back to the farm. Okay? Just for a day or two. Just let her calm down, feel safe. I don't know. It's against protocol, and I'm not sure she'll even-- We haven't processed her yet. Just... Let me observe her, okay? If she's delusional, I'll take her to the hospital. If I sense she's a fraud, I'll bring her back to the station. If she's a con artist, she's going to play you at every turn. Come on, it's almost Christmas, and I will take full responsibility. Okay? I know this place. So, my parents live here in the big house. I live in one of the outbuildings, and my sister moved back with her daughter, temporarily. We buy our milk here. The Morgans have the best cows, don't you think? Actually, um, this used to be the Smith farm. My grandparents bought it from them back in the '60s, and they renovated it. What do you mean, "back in the '60s"? What do you mean what do I mean? What year is it... now? It's 2016. The way you're looking at me, you don't believe me, do you? I, um... Why don't we go inside? Come on. Well, the text was 20 minutes ago, so they should be here any minute. Is he really going to let her stay here? She could be-- [gasps] Oh, they're here! So, everybody, say hello to Hanna. Welcome, dear. You did absolutely the right thing to call the police. Okay, how about here? More towards you. Okay. I'm just saying it's shifty. Here? A little right. You know, it's just shifty. I mean, some stranger in a costume shows up in the middle of Central Falls, pretending she doesn't know where she is? She didn't seem shifty. She seemed nice. How about now? Back it up. You know, people who take advantage of others always seem nice. Do you know how many identity thefts there were last year? 15 million. Google it. How about now? [Sighs] Actually, I think it's better by the window. [Wearily] Okay. You remember the fellow who sold me the time shares in Florida? Here we go with the time shares. Mom, this lady wasn't selling time shares. He was the nicest guy you'd ever to meet. So handsome... Never in a million years would you believe that he was just... [mouthing silently] "...up to no good." Never in a million years. Sweetheart, when did you become so suspicious? I'm not suspicious. It's women's intuition. And I just feel that something fishy in going on around here. Okay. [???] I think you could be a little more charitable. Mom, I'm not being uncharitable. It's just, I don't know... It's a little weird, you have to admit. Where did she come from? We don't know, and now she's just here in our house? Mom, if she has amnesia, will she forget she met us last night? Gwenny, not so much sugar on your oatmeal. You know, she seems fine to me. I mean, the clothes are a little weird, but-- Dad, no one just lands in Central Falls without knowing how. She is perfectly nice. I'm sure there's a very good explanation for what happened. Besides, she didn't land here, mom. She's from here. Okay, so has anyone ever seen her before? Or heard of her? Shh, shh, shh! Guys, guys... What if she walks in here, and she hears all of this? Just let her rest, get her bearings, and we'll all get to know her in no time. Shouldn't you have just a little bit more professional skepticism? There's nothing wrong with having a trusting spirit. Why don't I go in and check on her, see if she's awake, and you all be nice? Remember, she's a guest in this house. Hey, mom. Hey, um, were there ever any Christmas lights on the old gazebo? On the square? Christmas lights on the gazebo? Um, no. Why do you ask? Oh, uh, nothing. Just something Hanna said. Hmm. Hanna? [Knocks gently] You awake? Hanna? Jake? Jake! She's gone! What... What are you...? "Organic planet"? Can I help you find something? [Gasping in confusion] Gluten-free toothpaste? This is my dining room. Where are all my things? Uh... What was that? I... It's my kitchen. This is my home, I live here. Right. I've... got to make a call. She left. I tried to keep her here, but-- Which way? Thank you. Well... Is she, like, dangerous or anything? What... What happened to the hospital? There is no hospital-- No, it's a hospital! This is supposed to be the hospital! Hanna? Come on. I'm sorry I didn't tell you I was leaving. I couldn't sleep. All night, I kept thinking, if I could just get home, that somehow home would make everything normal again. But... But now I don't know what my home is. I don't even what "Gluten free" is. Most of us don't. And then I thought of Dottie. If I could get to the hospital-- What hospital? And today's her shift, and Dottie would explain everything to me, and somehow it would make sense, but... But Dottie was gone. Well, everything's gone. I... I don't know what's happening to me. None of this is real. I don't know if I'm dreaming, or if I'm losing my mind, or what. It must be really hard for you. And I see the way people are looking at me, like I'm crazy. Or worse, lying. You were right, about our farm being the Morgan place. It was a dairy, back in the '40s. Do you believe me then? Well, I believe, um... I believe that we're going to find out what happened. I'm really scared. You're going to be okay. I'm here to make sure of that, okay? Right. [Clears throat] Hey. The chief's not happy. I know. You gotta bring her in, Jake. You're gonna get in trouble if she disappears for real. She's not going to. She was just trying to figure out what happened. Oh, yeah? - So, what's her angle? - There is no angle. I believe her. [Scoffs] Oh... Oh, so she just dropped out of the sky from 1945? I mean, I believe she believes it. You'd better find something, or you're going to start sounding as wacky as she does. Thank you for the vote of confidence. - It's what I'm here for. - Yeah. - Right, I'll see you tomorrow. - All right. Let's see how this works... Oh, yes, it fits perfectly, doesn't it, Louise? Yeah... Great. Okay, so try these, and... I got the uggs on Ebay. "Ugg sunnybay?" Mom, she doesn't understand. They didn't have uggs in 1945. Ladies always wore heels. It says so right here. O... kay. Great. Well then, you are going to love these. Bedroom slippers? Why don't you try these? You can go try them on in there. Anything else... Wonderful. Wow! Look at her, uncle Jake. And it's like a... You know, a tag sale, but for the whole world. Like, imagine you move, and you don't want to take your stuff with you, you can sell it here. And you can find anything. Like, charm bracelets, or once I found a spoon from the year my mom was born. And... it's inside this little thing? No, this is just a computer. A computer is like a... A car. It can take you anywhere, but you don't have to leave where you are. Think of it like... [sighs] Never mind. Let's just look for something. Like... What year were you born? 1912. [Gasps] Oh, my goodness. My mother had a set of dishes just like that. Oh, wait, make it go down again. [Gasps] Look at that hat. I bought one just like that. They're selling it for that much? Apparently, she made a scene in the health food store. Well, if I had to eat quinoa I'd make a scene, too. Harv, I'm serious. She said it was her house. As in, she lived there. Sorry, she thinks she lives in the health food store? Mm-hmm. Well, then she escaped before the police got there. Oh, and I had George google her, and you know what he found? - What? - Nothing. Oh, well, I mean, I've googled myself before, and nothing turned up, and I'm not saying I'm from 1945-- - From 1945. - Yeah. She's pretending that she doesn't know how she got here. I mean, what did she do, time travel to now? That'd be cool. [She scoffs] Great. Hon', look, I'm not saying that none of this is out of the ordinary, but don't you think-- I am not being paranoid. 1940s, my foot. I am getting to the bottom of this, I am. Yeah, I know you will. I will. You and I are going to do a little more research. Okay... Nothin'. DMV records don't go back that far. Hmm. No photo. Convenient. Well, they didn't have them then. In fact, until the '30s, they didn't have drivers' licenses. Aren't you becoming the historian. She could have gotten this printed at any copy place. And her get-up? You can find those clothes at the thrift store. And why would she want to do that? I don't know, identity theft? Oh, come on. Louise says she is making herself quite at home. Maybe she's homeless, and she wants you to take her in. [Chuckles] Sarah... Well, you tell me. She didn't just drop in from 1945. "Lune Paris." "Paris Moon." Stop playing with the evidence. Just sayin'. [???] That's it... Just like that. And this makes it stick? Mm-hmm. Are you sure? What if it falls? - It won't. - How do you know? Oh, Dottie and I, used to make one every Christmas. But when the war started, sugar was rationed. What is "rationed"? Gwenny... I think it's time to get ready for bed. But-- "But" nothing. Go on. Will Hanna read to me? I guess you're going to have to ask Hanna. Of course. I would love to. Yes! You sure? You don't have to. Oh, no, I want to. I... I just... Well, I've always wondered what Christmas would be like with a big family. Well, it's a little bit chaotic. No, it's... It's perfect. "'It's a miracle,' "the wise old woman told Lily, but Lily frowned "because she didn't believe in miracles. "Outside, the snow fell silently, "and the only noise was the stomping of small hooves. The reindeer were impatient." It's probably time for bed. Hanna... Do you believe in miracles? Well... I don't know. I mean... I don't know what I think anymore. I do. Mr. Cook says you should believe in everything with an open mind. Your Mr. Cook must be a very smart man. He runs the science fair. He also turned an old building into the library. He paid for it himself. He's exceedingly wealthy. Well, that old building was my hospital, and it was just built before the war. He also believes in time travel. He does? Mr. Cook says just because you don't understand something doesn't mean it doesn't happen. Gwenny? It's time for bed. Let's go. [Radio plays]: All right, all you stargazers out there, get out your wool hats and your scarves. Tonight will be the first appearance of the De Vico comet in 71 years. Just in time for Christmas. This has been Fred Damsky with Public Radio. [???] We'll just get that one present for your father, and then we'll... George? [Sighs] Hurry up. We're going to be late. Hang on, I just got a text. It's like that thing's attached to your arm. [Chuckles] Nope. Can't say I've ever seen her before. She would have come in to buy a whole outfit of 1940s clothes. Oh, I would remember her. I've got loads of great stuff from the '40s. Nobody's interested now. It's all about the '80s. I told you, Louise. You're not being kind. I'm just being careful, mother. You're being suspicious. We should be supportive. It's Christmas, after all. Mom! Look! [Chuckling fondly] Beautiful. Harv... You are not going to believe what I am seeing. Now, you thought I was paranoid, but I think I know what's going on. This is one of my favorite things about the period. Mom... You have to come and see this. It's the gazebo. It is just like Hanna said it was. Look at how beautiful it is. Look at all the lights. What happened? People used to pass these traditions on to their children. I don't know, kids these days just don't seem interested the way they used to. [Hanna]: Yes, that's exactly how it is. I mean... was. Everybody comes out for it, seems like all the neighbors. We'd carol, we'd drink hot chocolate, we'd laugh. Can I carol? Kids don't go caroling anymore? I guess we just... don't. I don't know, we've just never done it. Can we, mommy? Can we carol? Yes. In fact, I have an even better idea. ...and that got me to thinking, what if they're all in it together? A conspiracy? Well, you don't think it's a coincidence? I mean, some stranger just drops into town in a costume, and instead of arresting her, or taking her in for questioning or whatever, the entire policeman's family are in there buying the same kind of clothes. [Scoffs] Really? Yeah. Why would they want to do that? My point exactly. The whole thing is just getting weirder and weirder. [???] Hey! I didn't think anyone was home. Just me. Are you okay? It's all a little strange. A lot strange. And sometimes, I look around at all of this, and at the tree, and your great family, and... I feel happy. Well, there's nothing wrong with that. But then I feel guilty for being happy. It's just... I mean, I... I'm not explaining this well. - That's okay. - I just... Well, I've never known a Christmas like this. It wasn't like this back when... Well, where... You know, where I was, and- and... The war, it changed everything. But even before that, I never had a big family. I had my husband, Chet. We were friends since childhood. We always knew we would be married, and... And, finally, we were, right before the war. And then he was gone. And now... - Everything is gone. - Not everything. You have all of us, and this Christmas. Here. This... Is one of my favorites. What is it? What, this? Um... It's a, uh... They used to be called "albums." [40s Christmas music plays] Can you dance? [???] Brings back memories. It's so strange. I don't know if I'll ever be able to get used to any of this. I'll help you. You can trust me. [???] [clears throat] [chuckles awkwardly] Hey, guys. [???] Mom, it was innocent. I was just trying to make Hanna feel okay. Don't tell me. Tell Sarah. Tell Sarah what? Oh, Jakey, you can see how she looks at you. Sarah? Oh, ma, don't be silly. What do you think? [Gasps in delight] Oh! That is gonna be perfect. Okay, what are you girls up to? It was Louise's idea. It was Hanna's inspiration. We're all gonna go out caroling tomorrow, like an old-fashioned Christmas. In this? You said you wanted to make her feel more comfortable, didn't you? And invite Sarah. - Tell her that you're sorry. - Sorry for what? You're such a dope. - What? - You saw her face! Okay, what is this, hmm? Is this some sort of, like, secret female language I'm missing? Ow. I love snow. Do you like snow? White Christmas, and all that? That'd be nice. What about you? Hmm? Do you want snow? People are talking. What? You know what. Um, if I knew what, I wouldn't be asking what. So... What? Her? [Sighs in exasperation] Sighing isn't denying. What am I even denying? People are worried about who this stranger is, and we're supposed to be "investigating," but in reality, one of us has the hots for her. [Laughs derisively] Oh, I do not. [Scoffs] You think I'm just your little sister's Goofy friend, but, uh, I wasn't born yesterday. Oh, Sarah, come on. I saw it with my own eyes. Look, what am I supposed to tell people who are worried? Like what, slow dancing is some new interrogation technique? I wasn't dancing. We were dancing. I-- We-- I-- It was just... I was just trying to make her feel comfortable, that's all. Obviously. I mean, you should get a promotion for "making the suspect feel comfortable." Okay, stop doing that. What? This-- The air-quote. - Is she guilty? - No! - A fraud? - No. - Unhinged? - No. Then what? [Sighs] I don't know. Maybe you should dance with her some more. [Sighs] You are such a brat, you know that? So are you going to come tonight? What, caroling? Mm-hmm. Are we gathering more information on the suspect? Come on... Just come. My mom wants you to be there. Do it for her. Give me the rest of your fries, and I'll consider it. Phew, that's a tough one. Okay. [Caroling]: ? God rest ye merry gentlemen ? ? Let nothing you dismay ? Remember Christ, our saviour ? ? Was born on Christmas day... ? To save us all from Satan's power ? ? When we were gone astray ? O, tidings... [laughing together] ? ...of comfort and joy ? Comfort and joy ? O, tidings Of comfort and joy... ?? ? ...laughing all the way ? Bells on bobbed tails ring ? Making spirits bright ? What fun it is To ride and sing ? ? A sleighing song tonight ? Oh, jingle bells jingle bells ? ? Jingle all the way! ? Oh, what fun it is to ride ? In a one-horse open sleigh... Hey! ? ? Jingle bells, jingle bells ? Jingle all the way ? Oh, what fun it is to ride ? In a one-horse open sleigh... Hey! ? ? Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way ? ? Oh, what fun it is to ride... ? Hey. What's going on? I was here. The night of the storm. I brought the dog back. His name was Ruffin. It's different. There... There wasn't a fence. But it is the same house. Wait, you... You brought a dog here? He was lost. He came to my house. I tried to call the owners, but there were people on the party line, and they wouldn't get off. Party line? So I brought him here. They were so kind. They invited me to stay because the storm was so bad. And if I had stayed, I... I wouldn't have driven my car into the snow bank, and... I'd still be back where I belong. [Running footsteps] Hey, we're going to go to the town square, come on. Come on. ? Oh, come Let us adore him ? ? Oh, come, let us adore him ? Oh, come Let us adore him ? ? Christ the Lord... ? [crowd clapping and cheering] This is so much fun! I know! You made us all so happy tonight, dear. Me? I didn't do anything. You inspired us. All of us. It's such a shame that they don't light up the gazebo anymore. Oh, it was so beautiful. It would light up the whole square. Oh, that's our war memorial. It honors all of the town's men who were lost in war. I know. Hanna? What is it? It's Chet's name. He died in the war, but... His name isn't here. [???] [sighs heavily] [???] [door closes] Where have you been? Huh? I have been texting you all night! Where have you been? Oh, uh, I dunno, I didn't have my phone on. You live with that phone on. Where were you? Nowhere. Son... Everyone is somewhere. Huh? What is that? What is that around your neck? Hanna gave it to me. It's like, you know, from old times, 1940, or something? Hanna? Mom, it's no big deal. We were all singing songs and-- Singing songs? Harv, say something. It was fun, what's the big deal? What am I supposed to say? I-- Songs. That's... Okay. When did he start to sing? Hmm? Mom... Oh, no. Mm-mm. No. Hon'... I am just going to ask a few questions, that is all. Better safe than sorry. Buddy... singing? Come on. Nice try. All I'm saying is that-- - Hold on, hold on, please. ---It's suspicious. The crazy claims, the weird clothing, the brainwashing. There's no brainwashing. Really? Okay, look, I can explain if-- And now everyone is singing. You know, since she got here, this entire town has been out of whack-- Mrs. Jones, if you'll-- And it's your job to get to the bottom of it, but for some reason, she's staying at your house-- Mrs. Jones... --Like she's some sort of guest. I am worried-- [sharp piercing whistle] Mrs. Jones, I can assure you, the Central Falls Police Department has this situation completely under control. We take your concerns seriously. Don't we? Absolutely. And we are looking at every angle on this. But now it's late. When the department is ready to issue a statement, you'll be the first to know. Why don't you go on home now, Mrs. Jones? We're taking care of it. [Whispering] Wow. [Sighing] We've got to do something, Jake. It's our duty to the people of this town. It's our job. Every day that goes by, there's something else that's fishy. Just tonight, her husband supposedly died in the war? What's so fishy about that? But his name's not listed on the memorial? That's fishy. So you're saying she's lying about the house and the dog? The kennel is named after the dog she found. I mean, how could she have pulled that off? She could have read the sign, and then made up some story about some dog named Ruffin. Con artists think on their feet. And the clothes, she could have found at some thrift store. And the license, she could have had printed. How can you keep wondering? "Paris Moon." It was invented in 1928. By the '40s, it was one of the most popular perfumes in the country. Okay. Great. So? Okay, so they stopped making it in the '60s. There is no trace of it. I mean, there's no place she could have gotten this. She could have found an old bottle on Ebay. I had the lab test it. It hasn't oxidized yet. This is the real deal, Sarah. Hmm. Hey, by the way, impressive whistle. Who taught you how to do that? You did. Third grade. [Chuckles] Let's go inside. [???] [key clatters] I don't know how I got here, and I don't know how I'll ever get home. This whole thing is as surreal to me as it must be for all of you, and yet, you've all been so kind to me. So, so kind. Just last week, when I was back... Back in... In real time. I told Dottie, right there in front of the movie house, I told her, "nothing ever gets solved by blubbering." It just doesn't do anyone any good at all. And since I don't know whether I'll ever be able to get home again, I'm going to make the best of things here. I'm gonna find happiness... I'm gonna find some way to be useful, and... Just stop wishing things would be different. I may have found a solution for the town's Christmas lights. It's not going to change the world, but... It's something. [???] [Sarah]: Okay, so what's our next move? Why don't you call the Jones woman, invite her to come meet Hanna, let her see what Hanna's surprise is. Maybe she'll stop being a pain? Might want to present it with a little more tact. [Mrs. Jones]: Okay, I'll be right there. Harv? I'm going to the library! ...and one of the nurses' stations, it was right there.. I think. It all looks so different. Well, the adult patients' ward was upstairs, and my favorite one, the pediatrics, it was over in that corner. There was a door here, it went to the back stairwell. Or maybe it was over here... There's a door here. That goes down to the storage room. - Come on, it's this way. - Are you sure? I can't believe we never knew about this. Oh, wow, look at all those. Well, well, well... I always wondered what was in that locker. It's nice to see you again. Do I know you? It's Mr. Cook. He's the man I told you about. He's the one who made this into the library. Oh, then you must think I'm trespassing, but I can explain-- I'm... I'd like to show you something. It'll only take a moment. [???] Books, as you can see, are my passion. That's why I saved the old hospital. They were going to tear that thing down, can you believe that? Tear it down? Books saved me from a very lonely youth, being a child of war and all. Sometimes, the smallest things change a life. For me, it was reading. [Dogs barking] [laughing] Ah, you incorrigible dogs! I love 'em to death. Now, somehow, my assistant manages to never spill a drop. Would you like some tea? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [Dogs barking excitedly] I have to be truthful here, I have heard all the stories about you, and... "time travel". Oh. Oh, so you just wanted to see the talk of the town. That's true, but... Actually, I wanted to see how you were doing. Do you mean that... Do you mean that... You believe me? More than that. I have something that belongs to you, from a long time ago. [Gasps] It's my camera. How did you get it? Nurse Hanna... I'm Toby. Toby... I used to read to him when he was a little boy. Oh, your arm, it healed. Look at you... So young. [Dogs barking excitedly] Hey, stop it! Ralph! Rex! Both of you, stop! My sister breeds them. It's become a family business. Actually, because of you. Me? Yes. You remember when you took that lost dog home, and the owner was so grateful, that she came to the hospital to thank you. Oh. Oh, but I was here, I was gone. And someone told them if they really wanted to return the favor, they should come and read to me. Oh, well, that was Julia or Dottie. Yes, because I was your favorite boy in the hospital. You were. [Chuckling together] And then, they mentioned that you were hoping I wouldn't have to spend Christmas alone. Oh, it was definitely Dottie. Yeah. So they took me home. Oh, wonderful. Oh, yes, I remember they had a little child. Clara, my sister. Your sister? They adopted me. [Gasps] And Sue, my adopted mother, realized how important Ruffin was to the family, so she started a kennel. That's why I keep seeing so many golden retrievers here now. Yeah, they're service dogs. They've been helping a lot of people over the years. These two were drop-outs. They're too silly to be service dogs, so they're mine. [Toby roaring playfully] [clicks shutter] Oh... Darn, I'm out of film. [Chuckling] Film... What? Almost no one shoots film anymore. It's all digital. It's what? That's all right, I know someone who can develop that for you. Oh. And Dottie? How did her life turn out? Dottie... She's still here. Would you like to see her? [Laughing in delight] Yes! Yes, please! Dottie's here? She's here. [???] I heard she was quite the character once. [Hanna chuckles] That's Dottie. But since I've worked here, well, she doesn't talk a lot. I'm not sure how much she remembers. Hi, Dottie. Nurse Hanna is here to see you. Nurse Hanna? Dottie... Look at you. Can she hear? She doesn't respond to much anymore. Dottie... It's me, Hanna. Dottie? Yes, it's me. [Murmuring faintly] She... She's trying to say something. C-Com-Eh... What? "Comment" on-on what? Hanna. You should see this. When we moved her into this unit, that's the only personal thing she brought with her. Must be her prized possession. Well, it's addressed to Dottie. It's from me? "Darling Dottie, I'm finally in my place "in the big city, address below. Can't write more because it's blazing hot..." Well, that doesn't make sense. I never lived in a big city. Keep reading. "...P.S. We made it in time for our third year of bliss. Yours, Hanna." Dated... August 16th, 1946. Well, that's our anniversary. Chet made it home. [Gasps] They said that he was lost in the war, but he-he made it home. That's why his name wasn't on the memorial. Chet didn't die. Hanna... This means that you get to go home, too. But... But how? She didn't say "comment". She said "comet". Oh, the De Vico comet. That's the comet everyone was talking about, and-and you said that people were calling it "the Christmas comet", but that wasn't its real name. Remember? It was just a week ago. A week ago for you, 70 years for me. Well, 71, to be exact. Here we go. [Clears throat] "The De Vico is a comet "with an orbital period of 71 years. "It was discovered by Francesco De Vico "in 1874, on December 22nd." Today. Today. Yeah. What does that mean? Uh... Let me try to make some sense of this. The last day in the hospital, I overheard the nurses talking. Dottie was beside herself. They found your car in the snow, you were gone, vanished. Someone mentioned the coincidence of a comet the night before. I was a boy, alone, I had a wild imagination, and... I had a belief in the magic of miracles. Yeah, you wondered if the comet was a miracle. Well, think about it! A comet that only comes every seven decades? At Christmas? On the night you disappear? And now you're here. But why? Why me-- [dogs interrupt, barking] It's to show you. - To show all of us. - To show us what? This! The dogs! For this house! For you being here! For me! For Jake! Don't you see what you've done, Hanna? And you didn't even know you were doing it. "The smallest stone makes a ripple in the water." That's what Dottie said. I was feeling so lost, like I had no purpose. But you do. The rain... The comet... Christmas? Do you believe in miracles? I think I do. Then believe, tonight, the Christmas comet is going to take you back home. [Car doors shut] I need to retrace my steps exactly. I'll have to change my clothes back into what I was wearing, and.. Oh, I'm afraid I'm going to forget something. I'm going to miss you all so much. I don't know what's going to happen. Will it work? Will I get back? I don't know, but I'm going to try. Because... My life isn't this one. I don't belong here. So, the Christmas comet will get her home? There is something... So magical about that. Seems a little... ? Woo! To me, but, hey, what do I know? Are we going to see the comet tonight? Please, please, please, please-- Okay, that's enough. Please! Yes. [Chuckling fondly] Here. What if it doesn't work? You said that you believed in miracles. I do, but-- And Mr. Cook said that you have to believe in something before it can become something. Of course you do. He's right. Otherwise-- There is no otherwise. It's gonna work. 'Cause it's a Christmas miracle! [All laughing fondly] You ready? [Sighs sadly] Don't make me say goodbye. Wait, Hanna-- Don't say anything. I wasn't crying when I left. I met my husband when I was 6. He used to pull my pigtails. And I... I thought he was such a nuisance. Turns out I was the last to realize that he was the love of my life. Just like you and Sarah. Sarah? What was it, pigtail pulling? Or did you hide her books? I used to put snow down her jacket. Of course, she did much worse to me. She's still a brat, though. And you wouldn't know what to do without her. You just haven't realized it yet, but you will. You two look at each other the same way Chet and I did. It's time. I know. Chet's a lucky man. Sarah's a lucky woman. Hanna... If this works, and you get back... You think... You'll remember all of this? I don't know. Who can predict a miracle? [Crowd murmuring in anticipation] Hello, my daughter! [Everyone chatting happily] I got you, buddy. What do you say, a little candle for my Christmas honey? All right, okay. Hey, mama. When's it here? My neck is gonna fall off! It's not for a while, silly. We're gonna watch the gazebo lights go on. What? [Chuckles] Well, it's about time. Mm-hmm. Have you lost it? No, actually, I, uh... I think I found it. Come on. Hi, guys. Hi. Okay, everybody! Here we go! [Crowd]: Ten, nine, eight, seven... It looks great. Six, five, four, three, two, one! [Everyone cheers and gasps in wonder] It's wonderful. [Cheering and laughing] Oh, come on. [Laughing together] [voices singing] ? Silent night ? Holy night ? Shepherd's quake ? At the sight ? Glories stream from Heaven afar ? ? Heavenly hosts sing "Hallelujah" ? ? Christ the savior is born ? Christ the savior is born ?? Look! It's here! I'm scared, mommy. Don't be, my love. [Knocks gingerly] Hanna? He's here. [Sighs nervously] She's gone home. She's home! [Cheering] [laughs] Yes! What the... One more thing. Photos... From Hanna's camera. Look at this little boy. That's me. - [Giggling] - Yeah! Wait, that's the star we put on top of the gazebo! Mom... Look. That's grams and pops. It is. Well, I'll be. I knew they met in a hospital. Mom was a nurse, and it was just after the war... Hanna introduced them. She thought that'd be a nice thing to do. It was. [Laughs] If she hadn't done that one little thing, then... None of us would be here. [???] Look, sweetheart, there's your great grandmother, and your great grandfather. That's cool. [Chuckling fondly] Yes, it is. Why not just call your husband to help you? [???] Lowercase ? 03.12.2019
