THE KID WITH A BIKE Hang up, Cyril. It's like last time. The number's not in service. Hang up. Give it here. You dialed wrong! Let me do it. Okay, but put it on loudspeaker. And if you get that message again, hang up, okay? Yes. Go on. The number dialed is not in service. Hear that? Go and play. I'll call the manager. We did that. You heard him. Your dad's moved out. You have to accept that. He'd have brought me my bike. Ask the manager where he is. He doesn't know! Give me the phone! No! Get off me! Cyril! Alain! Catch him! Cyril, get down from there. Let go! You'll hurt yourself. Let go, Cyril! Calm down! Just calm down, okay? You done now? Come on. Where are you off to? - The bathroom. - Use the urinals outside. It's a big job. - You told the supervisor? - Yes. Go on, then. Is this the Val-Potet bus? - No, number 2 there. - Okay, thanks. Manager. It's Cyril, to see my dad. - Cyril who? - Cyril Catoul, fifth floor. Your dad left a month ago. - His name's here. - He's gone. - Can't I go up? - No one's there. But I'd still like - Medical office. Hello? I fell off my bike. Ground floor. The blue door before the elevator. Dad! Dad, are you there? What's going on? No one lives there. My dad does. The place is empty. Just ask the manager. Don't stay here. Go back down! Go on! Just go back down, okay? Wait! You fell off your bike? - You got lost in the building? - A bit. It's simple enough. - Where are you hurt? - My leg. - Is it bleeding? - No. - Did you bang your head? - No. Give me your name. We're his counselors. He ran away from school. Be reasonable. Come with us. Did you hear me? Come on! Let go of the lady! Come with us! Not so tight. That hurts. Leave the lady now. - I'm staying at Dad's! - He's moved out. My bike's here too! You can hold me, but not so tight. - Come on, Cyril. - No! I can let him see the apartment. Did you hear the manager? We'll go and see your dad's place, okay? Sorry about that. You coming now, Cyril? The director wants to see you. Get up. I know you're there. The others are already eating breakfast. You going to get up? - What time is it? - Ten to 9:00. It's Saturday. I have ten more minutes. The director wants to see you. You have to go. You're not getting up? Then I'll tell him you won't see him. Remember the lady you held on to at the medical office? She's here to talk to you. You hear what I'm saying? I brought you your bike. - You saw my dad? - No. - How did you find it? - Get dressed. How did you find it? You told the manager it was black with a chrome fork, so I looked for one like that. Where was it? I saw a boy riding it in the projects, so I bought it back from his dad. Bought it back? He said your dad sold it to him. He's a liar. He stole it and sold it back to you. Or else it's not mine. It's scratched there. It's mine. He stole it from my dad. - How much did you pay? - Never mind. Maybe your dad needed money for bills. No, he'd never have sold it. - Thank the lady. - Thank you. Watch this. Bravo! Watch. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. Thank you. You coming in for breakfast now? Cyril, watch out! Cyril, come back here! Could I stay with you on the weekends? I'll need to ask the director. He'll say yes. He needs foster families. Ask him now. No, I'm already late for work. I'll call him. Good-bye. You say you will, but you won't. Yes, I will. Good-bye. No, I don't know him. But he told me he came here. Maybe he said where he was going. I don't remember him, so even less what he said. Now let me by. He had a gold helmet. Those aren't common. I don't remember. Cut it out now. Yes. I'm riding my bike around the neighborhood. A boy tried to steal it. Maybe the one you bought it from. What color was his hair? Tell me anyway. It wasn't him. I'll ride a little more and then come back. - You came in with him once, right? - Yes, one Sunday morning. I remember him, but I didn't know he'd moved. I can't help you. Okay. Good-bye. - You're his son? - Yes. - He didn't tell you where he was going? - He did, but I forgot. He got gas for his motorcycle here. He had a gold helmet. Was it an old BMW 750? Yes, green and chrome. He put up an ad for his bike in the shop window there. When was that? About a month ago. - Where he was moving to? - Why would he tell me? Maybe there's an address on the ad. FOR SALE: BMW 750 MOTORCYCLE AND CHILD'S BICYCLE GUY CATOUL, BERGERIE BLOCK 5TH FLOOR, VAL-POTET Cyril, turn the tap off, please. Excuse me. I'll be done in five minutes. Thank you. Good-bye. Cyril, say good-bye. I hate wasting water. What's wrong? Is it that boy who tried to steal your bike? Did someone tell you something about your dad? You're off to a great start here! Tell me what's wrong. I can't guess. You heard the psychologist. Coming to your dad's neighborhood, you'd think about him too much. Maybe I should just have you on Sundays. We could go to the country or the seaside, then I'd drive you back. What do you think? Cyril, look at me. I'd like to see the man you got my bike from. Why? To tell him he's a thief? No. My dad sold it. I saw an ad at the gas station. What'll you say to him? I'll ask him about my dad. I still have his number. Shall we call him? Yes. Turn the tap off. Don't use up your credit. Mr. Gurza. 04336... Hi. Cyril... Gilles, my friend. Hello. What's the number? 043366310. Hello, Mr. Gurza? I'm calling about my bike. This is Cyril Catoul. When my dad sold it to you, did he say where he was moving to? Yes, Guy Catoul's my dad. Did he say where he was moving? He really didn't say? Good-bye. - Why aren't you coming? - I'm scared. - With me you won't be. - I'll watch you both. Here, Cyril. Go on. I'm riding alone! No, it's dangerous. I have to be with you. - Stay here! - I'm riding alone! - What if something happens? - I don't need you! Stay here! Calm down. He wants to ride alone! No, not on your own! Sit down, Cyril! Sit down! Can I sit down? What is it? I want my dad. It's warm. What is? Your breath. Let me. The other way. Give me your bag. Good-bye. See you on Monday. - Who gave you his address? - The police. What did the director say? He hopes it'll go well. He said he couldn't get the address. He could have, but he wanted to let your dad take the first step. So did the psychologist. But my dad told you he wanted to see me. Not that he wanted to, that he agreed to. - Same difference. - No. If he'd wanted to, he could have called. No one's stopping him. Don't be upset if it's not the way you dream it'll be. I'm not dreaming anything. Another sandwich? No. - Water? - Please. Thank you. - What? - Thank you. I didn't see him. He'll probably come that way. He's not coming. You should have given him your number just in case. Let's go to his place. - What if he's on his way? - He's 40 minutes late. Let's go to his place. I'll just check that street. - Hello, ma'am. - Hello. Could we talk to Guy Catoul? He's not here. Who are you? He's my dad. He was supposed to meet his son at 10:00. He wasn't there, so we came here. Where can we find him? Who are you? Cyril stays with me weekends. You know Guy? No, I saw him once to set up the meeting. He's doing kitchen prep at my restaurant. The Acacia, by the bridge. - This side of the river? - The other. Thank you. Good-bye. The music's too loud. He can't hear us. There he is! He went in back. There's a door in the alley. Come on. I'll climb over. I can see him! He's bringing the trash out. Dad, I'm here! - What are you doing here? - I came to see you. Should I jump, or can you open the door? Go around front. Around front. I'll wait here. Come on in. Want a drink? - Want a drink? - Yes. - What? - I don't know. Coke, peach juice, pear juice, water... Peach. - What? - Peach. Peach. - Is that woman nice? - She's okay. It's good she can have you on weekends. - You gonna be a hairdresser? - No. I have work to do in the kitchen. Come on. - She bought my bike back. - That's great. I had to sell it. I was broke. That's okay. When are you coming for me? - Where? - At the home. Aren't they nice there? You said it was only for a month. It's not easy for me. I wanted to call, but why bother if I couldn't come? That's okay. You changed your number? I sold my cell phone. I can't take you back. Understand? Not yet anyway. I need to put some money aside. I need an apartment and all that. When will that be? I don't know. I have a cell phone at Samantha's. You could call me on weekends. Want to write down the number? Just a second. Go ahead. 0479... 69... 56... 23. What's the number here? There isn't one. I mean, you can't call here. My boss doesn't like that. I'll call you. What's that? Sauces. Choron and Caribbean. Time to go. I have work to do. Can I stir it? Go on. Careful, it's hot. Off you go now. I have stuff to do before we open. Give me the spoons. When do you open? Noon. In half an hour. - I'll come with Samantha. - You can't. We're booked up. - You hungry? - Yes. What? Sausage? Chips? With paprika or salt? Paprika. Let's go. - Want one? - No. When'll I see you? I'll call you. Next Saturday? I'll try. Don't worry, I'll call. If you can't reach me, I'll come back here. Hold on. Could I have a quick word with you? No, wait here. I didn't come because I can't do it. It's too much. I can't look after him. Now that his granny's gone, I'm all alone. I can't. It's too much for me. I could bring him by for an hour on weekends. No, seeing him stresses me out. He likes you. Look after him. - He wants you, not me. - He'll forget me. I'm starting over. It won't work with him around. I just can't look after him. Even once a month would be good. No. Please, you take care of him. I don't want to see him again. Tell him I can't. You should tell him yourself. I've tried, but I can't. What did your dad say? That he'd call, maybe Saturday. I gave him my cell number. Come with me. - Why? - Come on. He heard us. - What is it? - You have to tell him, not me. Tell him. Don't come looking for me again. Stay at the home or with her. You'll be okay. You're not gonna call me? I don't know. No. No! Cyril! Stop that! It's all right... We're one short. Wanna play? After I take this shopping home. I'm gonna play five-a-side. There's... 4 euros 60 left. Put it on the counter. Thanks. - How much was it? - I don't know. Figure it out. I gave you 10 euros. - Five euros... 40. - Yes. - Give it back! - Come and get it. Attack, Pitbull! Go on, attack! Go on, attack! Make him cry! Go on, Pitbull! Go on, bite him! - That's good! - Go on, bite him! Go on! Okay, Pitbull, you win. Enough, I said! Enough! Come back down. Come down! Wait. Can I shake your hand? You're wicked, Pitbull. Respect. Shake his hand. I'm going with him. Logan, wash my car. Nabil has the key. Going to the projects? - Yes. - Me too. You got a flat. It's full of nails and glass here. I'll get the garage apprentice to fix it. - I have no cash. - It's okay. I have some. - It's a nail. - Yeah. Leave it in so he knows where the hole is. I'll carry it to the road. Don't wanna puncture the other tire. Where do you live? At Samantha the hairdresser's near the square. You related to her? No, I just stay there on weekends. Is she nice to you? Yes. - Smoke? - No. You're at the home in Theux? - You know it? - I spent three years there. We're made to get along. Let me see your eye. Hold my cigarette. There's a speck of dirt. Don't touch it! - You like PlayStation games? - Yes. - You got one? - No, I use an old PS1 at the home. I have a PS3 and the new Assassins Creed. Want to play? All right. What happened? The TV remote fell, and I tried to pick it up. Pitbull, pick up the remote. Where's Grandpa? At the pharmacy. But I bet he stopped at the bar. What channel? Four. - Will you be okay? - Thank you. Come on, Pitbull. Pitbull. Sit down. Sit down here, Pitbull. - You like me calling you Pitbull? - Yes. I'm Wes... Wesker, like in Resident Evil. - With the glasses? - I used to always wear them. Hold on. Don't say you're with me. Yes. No, I... I didn't go and play with them. I met some other boys. We're riding our bikes. See you later. - The hairdresser? - Yes. Mention me and she'd have said, "The dealer?" Everyone around here thinks I deal. The fuckers! You ever see me deal dope? Did I offer you any? Here. - It's wireless? - Yeah. Want something to drink? Coke, Fanta, beer? Fanta. Dagger or sword? Sword. Press R2 and pick "sword." - Her again? - Yes. Don't answer. Ignore her. Turn it off. There. Go on, play. Faster or I'll slaughter you. Dodge him! You have to waste that bastard. Here, Pitbull. Wait. No other guy in the gang has ever been here. Just you. To our meeting. Go on, play. Watch out there. There. Nice move. Go on. Bad headbutt. Here. Thanks. - Thanks. - See you. I'll get 10 euros from Samantha. I don't need her money. I'm glad to help you out. I'm hungry. Aren't you? Kind of. Good evening. What is it? I told you: a job we could do together. - What kind of job? - I have to be able to trust you first. You can. - Sure? - Yes. I'm not sure. There's something sneaky about you. Hey, Pitbull... you're a little sneaky, aren't you? I'm kidding! I trust you totally. Here. Want to come live at my place? - I'm at Samantha's. - You can change foster homes. There's a free room. My grandparents would agree. - Want me to ask them? - Okay. It's Samantha. I'll handle it. See you Saturday. I've been looking all over for you! He had a flat. I took him to the garage. I didn't ask you. Your bike. - I'll ride back. - You're coming with me! See you. See you. Keep away from that dealer! He helped me. Why didn't you call? Why didn't you answer your phone? Why didn't you answer? Tell us. I didn't hear the phone. - Liar! - Liar yourself! Apologize! Apologize for that! Apologize, Cyril. Apologize or you're not coming back. - Don't say that. - No one can say a thing. He's running rings around you. You canceled last week because of his nervous fit. Today we look for him for hours, and he insults me? Apologize or don't come back. You have no right to say that. It's him or me. You hear? It's him or me. Him. Gilles! See, it's off. It was while I was pedaling. Doesn't matter. You should have called when you got a flat. Get the water out. That's what I don't get: You didn't call. Why didn't you think I could help you? Or that I'd be worried about you? - I forgot the forks. - Answer me! I don't know. I didn't think. Wait for me. Enjoy. Why did you want me to come here? You're the one who asked. But why did you say yes? I don't know. Promise me one thing, Cyril. Keep away from that guy. Don't let him come near you again. - You promise? - Yes. He lowers the metal shutters and locks them. Did you turn your phone off? I'm doing it now. I'll leave it at Samantha's tonight. There. He approaches the corner and passes by you. He's carrying all the unsold papers. He puts them down. He opens the trunk. He bends to pick them up... No! The bag on his wrist first. Right. Empty it out. No! Oh, right. Okay. Look at me. If you forget the bag and his pockets? - I won't forget. - What does it mean? That I know where the money is. And that means? They'll suspect you because you worked at his newsstand. That means you'd be betraying me to the cops! - You want to put me in jail? - No. - What's first? - The bag. - Second? - His jacket pockets. And third, his belt thing. Come on. Practice with this. It won't kill him? No, but hold it at the bottom. Grip it tight. That's good. Pitbull. Tie this on me. How much you want? Five hundred euros? - No, nothing. - Then why do it? For you. Stop that, Cyril. What are you doing? - You stay in if I say so! - Why? I don't want you out alone at night! Go to the movies with Mourad. I'll just ride my bike. - With who? The dealer? - He hasn't got a bike. He's always around, trying to hire other kids. - He knows you're new. - I'm going out. Stop it! That's Mourad. Come on. Go to the movies with him and his parents. Mourad wants to be your friend. His mother told me so. Come on. - Hello. - I've come for Cyril. Come in. He doesn't want to go. Come and ask him. Why won't you come? Come on. - It's in 3D. It'll be fun. - I don't want to. Go on, Cyril. Come on. Okay. Bye. Bye. You coming to the game tomorrow? Yes. What time? - Two o'clock. - See you then. Apologize to your parents for Cyril. Cyril, get down! Get down! Calm down, okay? You're not my dad or my mom! I want to go back to the home! If you want to go back, fine! Call them and I'll take you. I'm not staying with you! Open up! Cyril, come back! Hello. This is Samantha, Cyril's foster family. Could I speak to a counselor? Yes. All right. Dad, I can't lock the shutter. What's going on? Did he see you? - I think so. - You think so? I had to turn his way to hit him. - Take this back. - Why? Take it! It was your idea. You did it alone. If you say I was involved, I'll kill you! Got that? Now get out! - But - - Get out! Did you forget what I said? I brought you something. - Where's that from? - I stole it, but no one knows. One meatballs with extra fries! Guy! Coming up. I won't tell the cops I gave it to you. - Beat it. - I won't tell. Beat it! You'll put me in jail! - I won't tell - - Shut up! Climb over! Jump! You okay? Yes. Don't ever come back here! The police are after you about the newsstand owner. We have to go. Put your bike away. I'll get my keys. Samantha... I'm sorry I hurt your arm. I'd like to come live with you all the time. All right. Give me a kiss. Seeing as the money has been found, the damages requested by Mr. Surlet and his son Martin amount to their hospital fees and the loss of earnings caused by six days closure, for a total of 1,750 euros. As the accomplice, Steve Deschamps, is insolvent and currently in prison, Ms. Samantha Puccio, guardian of the attacker, Cyril Catoul, will pay the victims the full sum in 20 monthly installments. Do you have anything to add? And you? Will you make a full apology to Mr. Surlet now? Yes. Will you accept his apology? Go ahead. I apologize for the money I stole and for hitting you and your son on the head. I accept your apology. You may now stand and shake Mr. Surlet's hand. Then we'll sign the agreement. Why didn't your son come? He won't accept your apology. Shift into a higher gear. - What gear are you in? - No idea. - What number's on the handle? - Eight. That's twice mine. - Can I try it? - Sure. I haven't ridden a bike in ages. - Can I have a sandwich? - Yes. - Tuna? - Yes. I'll have cheese. - What'll we do this evening? - I don't know. Let's invite Mourad and his parents over for a barbecue. - Where? - In the backyard. I have a barbecue in the cellar. - Shall I call Mourad? - Okay. Hello? It's Samantha. Cyril and I would like you to come to a barbecue. Mourad, you, and Jeannot. Yes, bring them along. All right. At 6100. Yes. His two cousins are here. - My age? - More or less. - What about you? - What? You're not inviting a friend? Mind your own business! Excuse me. - There's no charcoal? - Not until tomorrow. They're out of charcoal. I can get some at the gas station. I'll give you some money. I hope they have some. It's five or six euros. See you at home? Okay. There you go. Good-bye. Hello. A bag of charcoal. Five euros 80, please. - Here. - Thank you. - There you are. - Good-bye. Hello. Leave him alone. Get back in. Martin! What'll you do now without your bat? Go on, hit me! - I apologized - - Screw your apologies! Go on! Try to hit me! I don't want to. Go on! Get down, asshole! He climbed up, and I threw stones at him. - Sure he's not moving? - Yes. What did you do that for? - Where is he? - In there, near a trailer. Hold on. Hold on. If he's dead, we'll say he insulted us and you ran after him, and he climbed up a tree to get away and fell. Did the stones hit him? His hand's out, but it doesn't mean it was a stone. It could have been a branch. Yes. Get my cell phone from the car to call an ambulance. You took a bad fall. I should call an ambulance.
