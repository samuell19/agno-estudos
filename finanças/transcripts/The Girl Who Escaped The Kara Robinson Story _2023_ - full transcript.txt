The idea that she would runaway at all without her, her, her, Her purse, without her clothes, without her shoes! Kids do dumb things, ma'am. Even if she did runaway, without a thing, Without telling another soul in this world, she is 15! You need to find her. I'm sorry, I will file this report. Officers will know to be on the lookout.

Not as much as the navy, but all over the country. Where do you like to go? San diego's nice, especially since I used to live there. I am gonna let you go when I'm done.

You can call me aaron. Okay. May I ask what's happened?

We just need to know where exactly Did you pick her up from. The beachwood commons apartments, Right off the 20/26 exchange. Great. And can you tell me which unit? We can't remember. I mean it was just a girl coming out of nowhere. It's all right. I got off the bed, so I could put my shorts back on, And then I saw that there was this big, like, Lock thing on the door, and I knew it was gonna make a bunch Of noise, so I just opened it as quick as I could, And then I ran, and then I saw the guys in the car, like, Waved them down. I, I just talked to them. Sergeant bonnie jennings. I'm gonna be working with lieutenant rowland Here on your case. I did find this in the system. You were first reported missing almost 18 hours ago.

Is she okay? Mom, momma can you come pick me up? Oh baby. Baby, I'll, I'll be right there, okay. I'm coming right now. Okay, mrs. Johnson. I have a tough thing to ask, kara. Do you think that if we went back to the complex You'd be able to pick out the apartment? Oh, I asked the people in the car to remember What the apartment number was. I asked them, and I'm sorry to say they didn't remember. I think they were pretty distracted by the sight of you. I don't think I'm gonna remember. Kara, would you be up to coming back with us To give it a try anyway? Get justice. Get him. Yeah. I think we're close. I think this is it. Anything looking familiar? Uh, yeah, I just... It just looks the same. Maybe this guy can help. Excuse me, sir. Richland county sheriffs. We're looking for the apartment of a man here. Mid 30s, caucasian, brown hair, about five foot nine. Uh, sorry, it's a big complex. A lot of guys could be that, especially if you include Boyfriends and relatives, you know. Yeah, okay, thank you. All of his windows are covered up. He's got like a wolf curtain kind of over his bed, And he lives with a lady with long blond hair. I'm sorry, miss, I... He also had a wall full of animals. He had birds, rats, hermit crabs, guinea pigs, That type of stuff. A lot of fish, too. Oh, yeah, that's apartment 301, yeah, 301. Would you mind showing the sergeant here to the leasing Office, so we can pull the info on that unit? Yeah, sure. Thank you. Kara, let's get you back. That's great work. This is lieutenant rowland, I need a car watching 1532 slaw street, apartment 301. Suspect is considered armed and dangerous. Sergeant jennings is watching the scene. Radio: Copy that lieutenant. We'll put an all points bulletin asap. Officer please respond. Officers please- Kara, where is she? Ma'am? Kara robinson. Mrs. Johnson. Yes, you called me. You called me to tell me that she's here. What and, and she's not? I don't know, I- What do you mean you don't know? Where the hell is my daughter?! Momma. Oh, my baby. What's the word? No activity in the unit since patrol showed up, And none of the neighbors witnessed him leaving. Could be holed up, waiting for us. Could be. Let's go see. Police! Can I have the keys? Clear! Clear! Clear! Clear! Clear! All clear. This is the right spot. She was spot on. Jennings. I'll get the bolo out. And get kara to make that id. Yes, sir. Do a sweep of the area. Surrounding buildings, parking lots, any suspicious man. Get the technicians here. You'll have those additional search warrants asap. Yes, sir. Can't believe they have kept us waiting. I'm going to get you something. I'm fine. No, I'm going to say something and I'm going to get them to- No, please just stop, please. Are you hungry? Are you, are you thirsty? Are you... Miss johnson. Hi there. We haven't met yet. I am sergeant jennings. I'd like to give you some pictures to look at and See if your kidnapper's in there. If you're up for it. Yeah, of course. Number four. You're sure? Number four. That's the man that is leasing the apartment that you were in. Um, his name is richard marc evonitz. Unfortunately, he was gone by the time we got there. Are you saying he's still out there? Mom. We've got everyone out there looking for him. He's not gonna get far. Oh, well, everyone's looking out for him, that's reassuring. Kara, if there is anything that you think you might know, Or any information that you have that might help us figure out Where evonitz is going. Yeah, he was honorably discharged from the navy At least a couple of years ago. And the gray parakeet that he has, Actually I think it's a cockatiel, um, his name's clyde, And he's had it longer than any of his other pets. Uh, the woman that he lives with is probably in disney world Right now with somebody else, so he's got to go back to work Tomorrow, something to do with, like, air compressors. Family doctors name is dr. Reitz, And the phone number for that is 803-555-6714, And he's a got a history of anxiety, And he's got a dentist as well whose name is dr. Greg nublin And the number for that is 803-555-8562, 803-555-856, yeah. There's a box, a big box, too, underneath all of his animal Cages that he did not want me to know about, So you should probably find whatever that is, You should find that. We will. Be sure to do that. In fact, would you mind calling that all in right now? Thank you. While the detective is updating lieutenant rowland, I'd like to talk through some of what comes next. Okay. Two specially trained nurses are gonna come in, They're gonna collect your clothes, And any other relevant evidence, you know. First thing we have to do is we have to ask you some more Detailed questions about what happened. Okay. Okay? Mom, could you go outside for this part, do you think? Uh, of course, baby. I'll just be in the hallway if you need anything. Okay, kara, you ready? Yeah. Sir, what's in here just keeps getting worse. And no sign of evonitz. No, sir. Did find a vehicle registered in his name, a taurus, Not the trans am. Bolo's been updated with kara's id, but no hits yet. Let's damn well hope whatever he's hiding in his foot locker Is something useful. We have bolt cutters in here. Gonna need some evidence bags. That's the outfit that kara described him wearing. Those aren't? No, no, they're not kara's. Officer, you get me everything you can find on these cases, And the number to the spotsylvania county sheriff. Those notes decipherable? Some, these, these might be directions. Figure it out, lieutenant. Use whatever you need, and find this son of a bitch. Have you ever been to a gynecologist, honey? No. Okay, the next thing that we need to do here is A pelvic exam, all right? Okay, all right. If you could just scooch forward, Lie down and raise your knees. Okay, here we go. Get through this. Get justice. Please take this, he's dangerous. Seen this man? No, no. No. But, okay, I'm gonna put this up back. Okay, perfect. Have you had any updates from your people? Nobody's seen head or tail of this guy. I heard you want with the feds. They got a lead? No. What we do have is more information from the fbi And the silva/lisk task force on the spotsylvania cases. Sophia sylva, age 16, was snatched off her Own front porch. The police worked it as a runaway. The body wasn't found 'til months later. We put the wrong guy away for it in an uproar to bring justice To the girl, and not even a year later two other girls, 12 and 15-year-old sisters are grabbed from their front yard. This man holds these children for days, Then he drowns them in his bathtub and dumps their bodies In the swamp. That task force has been working those cases for five years. I'm not gonna say it's evonitz before the evidence is in. Hell, I'll say it. Evonitz is a serial killer of little girls. The papers in the foot locker were mostly full of stalking Notes, potential victims from the looks of it. But we've been able to track down all the most recent Targets, they're okay. Was the robinson girl in those notes? Kara, no she wasn't. The girl we think it was meant to be went to a friend's Instead of walking home. That makes you think about what other cases could be out there. You put some of my guys on that. I mean there's no way evonitz started with those murders. Sheriff, sheriff, we've gotten hold of the woman With the long blond hair. Evonitz's wife, ashley. She and evonitz's mother are exactly where kara said, Disney world. They're headed back to cooperate. Well that's good news. We've also got the mother's okay to search her house. And one of the sisters is coming in tomorrow to answer Some questions, too. I only pray that she's got something worth telling. You and me both. Kara. Kara. Hey. Hey, that's okay, it's not your fault, jess, it's not your. Oh, sweetheart. I want to go home. Are you okay? Can you tell me what happened? Where were you? Do you know where you were? Can you stop asking questions, please stop. Kara, honey, I, I just, you can tell me, You can tell me anything. I want you to tell me. You don't want to know, so just... Just don't ask If you don't want to know the answer. Any sign of him? Not a one. Seems like he just came by to drop his momma's car off And take her other one. I've updated the bolo, but he's switched cars once, I'm sure he's done it again. No, you're likely right. Fbi's on its way out to take control of the evidence Collection themselves. I wouldn't be surprised if they just end up shipping the thing Straight to quantico. That thing's gonna have some evidence of those Virginia girls, I'd put money on it. Maybe we'll find some stash of his in the house. Maybe. It's hard to take comfort in closing cold cases when He's still out there to make new ones. Listen, I'll stay here and wait for the feds. I want you to go and check in with kara. She should know where we're at with the search. Okay. Oh, hey. Hello. Come on in. Hey, thank you so much for coming over. This means a lot. My mom's just, like, in the kitchen If you're looking for her. Okay. Hey, kara, you're a tough girl to get an audience with. I can't do this anymore. Okay, come on. How can I help? Why are the police still here? Like, what's going on? Some of the officers are here for your protection Because we don't know where evonitz is yet. We just need to take that extra precaution. There are a lot of officers across both counties, And now the fbi involved. So, sometimes they might be showing up here For information, or updates. But the final reason is understanding. You know, they all know you escaped something on your own, So they're impressed, or curious, or just concerned. It's the same reason why you see people here who you've never Seen in this house before today just showing up with apologies And pecan bars. But I don't want that, I don't want any of this. I can certainly understand that. That is not fair to you. You have every right to be angry. But it just comes down to people caring. Thank you, sergeant. I think I'm just gonna go lie down for a little bit. That's not a bad idea. Okay. And then maybe you'll catch him tomorrow and Everything will go back to normal. Maybe. Might take a little while longer than tomorrow, kara. But sleep is always a good start. I think I'm gonna go over to ryan's after breakfast. You're not going anywhere. They still haven't caught that horrible man, and, And they're here to keep watch 'cause he could be out there Looking for you, anybody could. I was allowed to go to ryan's whenever I wanted without Asking you, like, two days ago. That was two days ago. What's different now? Kara. No for real, what's different now? I don't need protecting. I got back here all by myself, I'm not gonna stop acting The way that I used to act because of all of this. This isn't my life. It's just something that happened. No, we're not done discussing this. You are not leaving this house. Is it, is it okay that I came? Yeah, I'm so glad you're here right now. Let's go to my room. Do you want to do our nails or something? I can get my nail polish. Uh, yeah, whatever you want to do. Just ask. Ask what? Just ask what you really want to ask. No. No, I just wanted to see you. To see if you were okay. As, as okay as you can be. I'm okay. Really, I'm okay. Just ask. What happened? A man pulled into the driveway. He sent me to disney because he's a good man. Marc couldn't have done all that. I'm sorry to say he did, ashley, and if we can't track him down, He might do something else. So, do you have any idea where your husband might be? No. He says he's happiest when he's with me. If he's not at his mom's. He hasn't tried to call you or contact you at all? No. But he loves me no matter what, and I love him no matter what. Okay. Hi mama. Hi ashley. Stephanie? Hi. I'm sure they just called her in like they did us, honey. From what I know he's in ashley's car, But he told me he switched the plates. They were still south carolina, I think. He's probably gonna find a way to contact one of us soon. He's trying to find a way to get ashley to him. I have a feeling that this is not the first time marc Has done something like this with a young girl. Finding out the brother you care about isn't who you thought is a Tough thing, stephanie, but you have done good talking to me. Marc contacted me yesterday afternoon. I'm sorry. Sheriff, evonitz is at this motel outside of orangeburg. The room is under his sister's name, stephanie newell. She hasn't talked to him since. He should still be there. Not check out yet. Jennings, get down there. I'll get orangeburg sheriff to send a team asap. Copy. Oh, just ignore them. So you're still gonna come and pick me up Later for the game, right? Um, yeah. Okay. Of course, same as always. Well hello there. I'm here to talk to your mom. Sheriff stevens, lexington county. Right on, yeah, she's inside. Hmm, how are you doing? Good, I'm fine. You've been through a hell of an ordeal, young lady. You've been victimized. You ought to take some time to recover. You really shouldn't be out and about when we haven't Caught your attacker yet. Maybe you should get out there and catch him. You certainly didn't help me the first time around. You know that guy was gonna kill you, right? And all things said, you should be dead right now. He's likely killed at least three girls. Now the evidence hasn't come in yet, but it will. You should thank your lucky stars that you weren't next. Luck had nothing to do with it. Well, evonitz wasn't at the motel, But it looks like he left in a hurry. The shirt kara was wearing when he took her is here, And some of his clothes, too. Orangeburg's agreed to keep surveillance on the room in case He comes back, but I think he's probably on the move. Okay, make sure that evidence gets where it ought And come on back. One of the family tipped him off. Probably, but at least we know for sure he's running, Not stalking kara or some other girl, running. Yeah, at least for now. At least for now. The fbi sent the prelims on the fibres from the handcuffs, It's looking like a match to the fibres found on All three bodies, and there's a full palm print On the inside of the trunk. Between that and his sister's statement. I know. An entirely off the radar serial killer done in by his Intended victim, it's incredible. Hello kara. Jim price, sheriff for richland country. Are you gonna tell me to stay inside, too, Because you haven't done your job yet and my attacker Is a serial killer? I'd never presume to tell you what to do, kara. Even if I thought evonitz was a threat to you, and I don't. I won't ask who told you about our suspicions Since it doesn't matter. What does matter is what you know and what you want to know. Did he kill those three girls? We can't say for certain yet. What we know was in the foot locker you pointed out, Were articles discussing the disappearance and murder of Three girls around your age from about five years ago. Why would he have those if he didn't kill them? That's a good question, but someone was wrongly accused for The first girl's murder, which is why I make it a point To wait on the evidence. Would he have killed me? I can't say that. But even if he wanted to, you didn't give him the chance. So, the reason I came looking for you. I needed to come and say thank you for the incredible Thing you've done. Some people will try to tell you you're a victim, But you really are is a survivor, One with a kind of strength and grace that's rare in this world. We may not have your captor yet, but we're going to get him. And when we do, it will be because of you, kara. Thank you. You're welcome, I guess. You let me know if there's anything I can do for you. And if you wouldn't mind, I'd love to come by and see you sometime again. See you around then, sheriff. Sheriff price.

Wow, you never make breakfast, And I'd much rather know what's going on first. Okay. Well, sergeant jennings will be here to explain more, And if you have any questions, But last night that man killed himself. So it's truly over now, honey. You're safe. Why didn't anyone tell me that? I'm telling you now, sweetheart. It happened last night? Why didn't anyone tell me that last night when it happened? There was no reason to. I should have know-, what is it that you're trying To protect me from? You were having a nice time at the game like you wanted, So we didn't want to... Hey there, kara. If you think that I'm not mad at you, I- no, I know. You're absolutely right to be mad. If anyone deserved to know what was happening it was you. We should have told you right away. I should have known better. I'm sorry I broke that trust. You know, I'm not much trained in this sort of thing. But if I had to put money on it, I'd say you weren't just mad about the delay. I'm mad at him. I'm just so mad at him. And all I've been thinking about, The only thing that's been getting me through the Interviews and the exams and the people and everyone staring, All I wanted was just to get justice, And I wanted him to go to jail for a hundred years, And I wanted him to rot there. But only after I got to stare him down in court, And made him face me, and I got to tell him about everything That I remembered, and I'd let him know that picking me was The biggest mistake that he's ever made in his life. I don't know, I'm just mad at him. I shouldn't have yelled at my mom. That was messed up. So now that there's no trial, I don't have to tell my story in court. That's right. And my mom and my dad and ryan aren't gonna have to know What actually, like, like what actually happened. And they're not gonna be hurt. Well, it's for the best then. You're a hero, kara. I know it may not always feel that way. But the way you saved yourself, The way you, even now, are taking care of the people You love, you're a hero. I'd hire you for the force in a heartbeat. And as for evonitz, there is no doubt he knew you were His greatest mistake. And I couldn't be more proud of you for it. Just give her some time. She's processing a lot. Can you give us a second, sergeant jennings? Of course. I don't really feel like a hug right now, mom. Okay. It's not because of, like... I just feel like I really want to do what I feel like doing. Of course, and I'm sorry. I'm trying. I don't know what to do. I just really want to be here for you. I know you do, and I'm gonna try to let you know When you can be, okay. But you can't change what happened. It happened. But I'm still here. I'm still me. I survived. I survived.
