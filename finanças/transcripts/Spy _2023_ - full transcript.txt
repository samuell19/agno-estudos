Greetings! Hm! Sir, Khadir Khan has reached! Weapons are here. We are going in. Let’s go! Greetings! Sir, the bit coin is transferred. Consignment is ready. Hmm. Move. Move, move! Sir! Target captured! Take him down! Yeah! What the… [SIGNAL LOST] Fennec, come in. Fennec, come in! Hmm. Hey! Would you mind watching my bag? Yes… Sir, Khadir Khan. What? Tsk! Tsk! Tsk! Surprised I am still alive? You can’t dictate my death because I am not human. I am the devil. Devil! You took great trouble planning the attack. That’s why, Mr PM, I have planned a nice return gift to you and your country. Be ready. For the arrival of the Devil. Surprised I am still alive? You can’t dictate my death because I am not human. We claimed before the world that we had killed Khadir. But he is still alive. How? -Sir, that’s… Look! I don’t have the time or patience for your explanation. As the head of RAW, you have fooled India. You have lost my faith in you. I am sorry, sir. At least do we have some details about Khadir? We have information that he is spotted in Jordan, sir. I have activated our team present there. Very soon we will get some more information… How many days is very soon? Fifteen days. So, do we ask him not to plan an attack until then? -Wait… Continue! My source tells me, using bitcoin and crypto currency, staggering amounts have been exchanged, sir. It is confirmed that Khadir Khan is involved. We will begin the investigation and capture Khadir Khan, sir. We don’t have much time, Sastry. I should never again hear Khadir’s name or about his organization. Do the job and then talk to me. Sir. -Mr Naidu! -Sir… -Will you be able to manage the media? -Sir. -Kuldeep! -Sir! Send a red alert to all the agents… and call the best of them to the Head Quarters for an emergency meeting. Sure, sir. But… No ifs and buts. We have no time! -Just make it fast. -Right away, sir. -Kuldeep! -Sir? Where is Jay? GALLE SRI LANKA Hey, Kamal! Come in! Boats are returning to the port. Something is happening. Hey, Kamal! I think CG is here. Where the heck are you? Hey, come! Jay! -Where are you, man? Emptying. Send me the visuals. You might find them disgusting. Stop your business, and attend to the actual business. Fine. It’s a government job. We are helpless. Fast, fast, fast! Jay! Target arrived. He is the guy. I know! Get the weapon now. -Okay! Sit! Down! Over there! Hey! Come! Hey! Come! Kill them! -Hey, stop! Let's go! Hey, look there! Go! Look! Hey, look here! Hey, come! Kamal! One… Two… Hey, Kamal! What happened? -One sec! Come on. Who killed Subhash? Subhash… -I don’t know. Sick of hearing this for five years! Who is Subhash? I ask you one last time. I don’t know. Sir, sir, sir! Please, don’t kill me, sir. Who are you? What are you doing here? I am… -She is printing passports. Fake passports. What’s with passports? I am a student, sir. I come from a humble, middle-class family. They offered me money for printing fake passports. I agreed for my pocket money. Nothing more to it, sir. Sir, sir, please! Honestly, that’s all there is, sir. I did it for money. That’s all. Please, sir. Please! What are we going to do with her? She doesn't know anything. Let her go. How can we? What if she is on their team? No. I am sure. Put a GPS tracker and leave her! How, dad? How did it happen? I don’t know, son. A couple of them were here. They said he sacrificed his life for the country, handed me the medal and left. There was nothing left of him to have a final look. Who were they, dad? No idea. When I spoke to him… He said he had some work in Sri Lanka and would be back in a week. But these people say it was for the country. How do I console your mom? How did he die or why did he? I am not able to answer myself! Jay! Come, sit. -Hmm. How about some breakfast? -No, mom. How is your job? All good, uncle. I’m good! Are you on leave? -Yes. They gave me a week’s vacation. Your elder brother also had left for a job abroad. His memories are all that your parents are left with. Why don’t you at least find a job here? I will try, uncle. Take good care of them while you are here. Hello! Sir, please tell me! I’ll be there. Must you go? -Yes, dad. Anything about your brother? -No, dad. But I will certainly find out who killed my brother and how. As per information he was not posted at Sri Lanka! Your mom is on cloud nine you are home. Please leave when she is asleep. Otherwise, she won’t… she won’t let you go. Wow! Nice! Like a government function hall. Hm? -Isn’t there a lift? Hey! Do you know who he is? -Who is he? He killed twenty men. On PubG? -Huh? Whoa! Well hidden. You have hidden the RAW office in a government function hall! Wow! Cobwebs! Nice! -This is the one. Oh! What are you looking for? Those things… Fingerprint scanner, retina scanner, massager… you have all these, right? -For security? -Whatever for? Hey, dumbo! Don’t you watch Hollywood films? Hey…behind a cloth store, or below a bakery… you have them, right? You can’t step in unless you press… Ah! Wow! A door and a latch! No security. Hey,Security! Security! There’s no one! No security for secret team! Hey, what is this like a dilapidated hostel? You call this an office. Hey! Too much, man! Even my granddad plays Candy Crush on I-Pad. What is all this? -Come in! Ancient, man… R&AW HQ Hello! -Hmm? Over there. Mr.Murthy! All the best! Do the computers work? Uh… Sir, are you Mr Murthy? Bills… What bills for the budget you granted, sir? Good timing and rhyming. Bills… My friend had to fish, dressed in briefs and we survived on selling it, sir. How can you expect bills for it, sir? How bureaucratic! Seventy rupees missing. -Aha! Are you going to buy a new building with the seventy rupees? Sir, we didn’t go to Srinagar Colony. We went to Sri Lanka. If we prioritize bills, when do we do our duty, sir? Duty is my religion. Duty is my life. ‘Duty is my life’ Okay! I will deduct the seventy rupees from your salary. You want to deduct it? Hey! Do my duty mindedness and your miserliness match at all? Huh? Damn! Brother Kuldeep! -Jay! How are you? -Good, good. Just one second. -Hmm. CLASSIFIED What? A new mission? Take your time. Jay, you okay? Sastry sir is calling us. Let’s go. -Yeah! Jay! Come. What’s this, sir? Come! Have you seen Khadir’s file? Yes, sir. Khadir is like a virus, Jay. You stall him on one side, he will pop up and spread from the other. He is a cheap smuggler who supplies weapons to insignificant terrorists. I took him for a small snake and cut off his network. I never heard of him later. But two years later, weapons were smuggled from Pakistan to India. But these weapons were advanced. When we enquired as to how… we discovered he had started a factory. Connecting the sleeper cells in our country with the money he made from selling arms, he became a threat to India. A number of people died because of him. We passed orders to Subhash to kill Khadir. Subhash executed the mission effectively. He killed Khadir. I watched it too. But… But? But what sir? He is still alive. He is still alive. His network has been activated again. Before that rogue Khadir Khan resurfaced, there was a huge transaction in his network. He is dealing in bit coin sir, Eddie… was there any suspicious activity on the Indian borders around the same time? One second. Check for the same time. An hour or so is fine! We have intel from our assets in Singapore that there was a huge transaction. A truck entered India at Raxaul at India-Nepal border. We have information from our Army that the truck had radioactive material. Sir! How long after the transaction did the trucks cross the border? Next day. The transaction was done for these trucks, sir. He is planning a nuclear attack. There is a chance of a nuclear attack on India, sir. Oh, my! What is your plan? If my guess is right, with every transaction, trucks moved from Nepal, sir. If I go to Nepal, there is a chance of capturing Khadir Khan. Eddie. I want the best team. Okay! -Jay! -Sir? This operation is about India’s honour. It is about the safety of every Indian. If you don’t find and kill Khadir Khan, the surgical strikes at Uri and air strikes on Balakot, and operations like Leech become lies. We will lose our honour and credibility. India can never lift its head before the world. You have a great responsibility. Act with caution. Remember the Samurai story. Sure sir. Dating app? You have time for all this? Hey, you… Watch out. Don’t become a patsy. It’s Eddie, man! Eddie and you?! Wow! Happy for you! Only encrypted messages are safe. They can’t be traced. Wow! Good time to smoke it vibe yard! Didn’t think much about Delhi’s pollution. I get it now. Finish that smoke quickly and we will leave. It’s time for the flight. Lighter... No lighter? Then why come here? Look there! Who’s that? She looks like a Siddipet model. Much more than that. Hey! Why is she coming straight to me? Hello, I am… committed. -I am Saraswathi. -I am Jay. He’s Kamal. Qadir Khan was last seen at the location of Myanmar. He’s going to meet someone there and planning something. You must go there. Local agent Abhinoor will help you. And one more important thing. Subhash? You don’t have to worry about it. He was not just a colleague or mentor. He was a great friend. I am in RAW today only because of Subhash. I really miss him. You can trust me. This mission is not about Khadir Khan alone. I must find out about my big brother, Subhash. In Jordan… One of my batchmates, Akram, is in Jordan. -He will help you! -Thank you! Good luck. KATHMANDU NEPAL YANGON MYANMAR How are you, brother? Can you take me to Naya Bazar? Oh, nice song! Hey, stop the song! You are aware, aren’t you? What’s wrong? You didn’t like the lyrics? You didn’t like the song? Or is the situation bad? What is your problem? Unnecessary interference. FIVE YEARS LATER Ah… go on. Sing disastrously. Chicken… bro! Order. Why is my life like this, man? What the heck! I went to meet the girl and had a break up! I want to forget her but even Tinder wouldn’t co-operate. I keep swiping right but not one matches my profile. You should have tried Bharat Matrimony. Sarcastic? I am afraid of dying single and you have a laugh at my cost. Okay! Out with it. -Okay! Say it! Say all that you want to say. Shoot it. What do I lack? -Time. I think even height. No…only time. Hey, don’t look at me like that. Hello, hello! Why are you… why are you so busy all the time? Why, why? Why? Were you a stripper in France? I will slap you with a slipper. Are you even my friend? Drink this up as well. I am leaving. Bye. Hi! -Hi! Hello! Sir, you said you were leaving, sir. You want to try? -No, thank you. Hello! Excuse me. Hey, would you like to dance with me? -Huh! Hey, you look like a log of wood. The girl? She is like a piece of sandal wood. Why would she accept when you ask her like that? Watch me now. Hey, sandal! How about a drink? Do you drink? Hey, sandal! Hey, who the heck are you? Hey! Hey! Oh my! Hi… -Uh... I need to tell you something. You look gorgeous. Excuse me? -Uh, I didn’t mean that way. I mean… you are traditional, beautiful. Very gorgeous. I have no words. -Thank you. -You are in the city… -Since a week. Such people here… They are everywhere. My father… -Did dad used to look after you in the village? Hmm. Yes. Don’t worry. You are in safe hands. I will take care of you from now. -Uh, but you are here… -On a job. Do you have any relatives here? -I am in a hostel. No one like that will disturb you again. Thank you. I am your dad from now. -Huh? What do you mean? -I mean… I will keep you safe like a dad. Oh, no. It’s okay. Don’t be shy. Uh…I am Vijay. Aishwarya. Hi. If you can give me your phone number, I will just store it. Hmm… I mean… only if you are comfortable. “For the first time, a gaze has touched me and my heart pinged your message” “My heart strangely doesn’t obey me It’s gone giving way to dreams” “Refusing to stay at the frontiers Mind travels hither and thither” I want to ask you something. -Sure! I want to vacate the hostel. -Good decision. This is a stupid hostel. Let’s find a better one.“Who is the winner in this war?” I want to stay with you. “Isn’t it the love that broke the shackles?” -Hm? “Jham Jham re, a battle begins in the heart Let me write you my breath as my last will” “Jham Jham re, luck shall be my abode if my name joins yours at the end” “Moonlight of the day like a sheet of snow” “Encompasses me with fresh dreams” “Like the first breath and the wave of breeze” “It reaches me, your first call” “An unknown bliss in destruction has accessed me because of you, you know?” “The allure that caressed my like a floral rain, is your laugh, will you believe?” “Jham Jham re, a battle begins in the heart Let me write you my breath as my last will” “Jham Jham re, luck shall be my abode if my name joins yours at the end” -Uncle! Mom! Aishwarya! Biryani! Agent Vaishnavi, NIA. What about him? Jacob, Suresh. All thanks to you. They were found because of the information you provided. -Me? -Jay… RAW…new recruit. This is on-job training, right? I used you as an asset. Who will be my better cover than you? I am an asset? Hmm. Clear the bodies. Uh… Agents are aware of honey traps, don’t they? Weren't you too quick to trust girls? Don’t fall in love so easily. Hmm? Be careful. Hello… Bro! -Huh? Are you done? Saraswathi... -Hi, this is Abhinoor! We have traced the IP address the bit coin was transferred from. It appears it belongs to a local smuggler, Masood. How does he look? This is Masood! So, this is how he looks? -Yeah! And that's your safe house. -Okay! See you soon! -Yeah! Thank you, brother. Hey! What is your business with the bearded guy in the market? Ganja? Huh? Oh! Did he give it to you in a packet? Are you an agent or a smuggler? USB. Check what’s in it. Interesting. On. DATABASE Wait! Send all these pictures to Eddie. Eddie, I have just sent you some pictures. Crosscheck them all and I want their information and location. -Copy that. -Yeah. Hmm. Jay, it’s Khadir Khan’s Khatmandu drug mafia gang in the photos. Location is Naya Bazar. Nice architecture. Beautiful place! Hey, be very cautious. Don’t get cold feet and torture me. Okay? We made a Zakir Hussain standard sketch. Why get nervous? It’s M F Hussain, dumbo. Who knows? Zakir Hussain could be a painter too. What do you know? -Crazy nut! Not every plan goes as devised. Just don’t act stupid. That’s all. You will see it for yourself. Hmm. I think this is our guy. Hi, brother G V! How are you? Hey, idiom costume! Why are you ramming into me? What happened? Can’t you see? Watch where you are going. What is it, man? What do you mean what? -What, man? Your friend, Bob? He gave me your contact. Are you not able to see? -Why are you pushing me? What is happening there? -Hey, wait. A serious operation is going on here and some guy is disturbing it. What is it? Brother, Bob is a friend of yours, right? Do you any... drugs… Bloody, shut your mouth. Me? Are you insane? Hey, stop there. -What rubbish are you talking? That is… Hey, stop. Hey, who are these people? Why are they giving me funny looks? They are behind me. Because you are a model… bloody! -Brother… -Who are you talking to? Our cover is blown, stupid. -Who are you talking to, man? The cover’s blown? Car, car! Keys! Sit! Hey! Get in, get in! -Go, go. Move fast! What’s that? -It’s for you, man. Just to encourage you. I don’t like the song. Why is she here? Hey, I have no idea. Sastry must be behind this. I don’t know at all. I am not Sastry. I don’t distribute talent. But from ANR Devas to Arjun Reddy, everyone wants the same expression? Huh? No change? Hey, can we concentrate on our mission with that around? Did you forget how she cheated me? Hey, we saw a movie when we were students… ‘Happy Days’, ‘Happy Days’! You look like one of the actors. Your expression is just like his. He was more irritable. Hey… Hello, you undertook 10 to 15 missions. Think in sync with your experience. Please, don’t think like a kid. I don’t want to change. This is me. Call up Eddie and ask him to send another agent immediately. And? Shall I order Paradise Biryani too? Hey, I don’t know all that. Ask him to change the agent. Eddie will step out of the phone and thrash us. Hey, is this a fashion store? To exchange what you don’t like? She is working with us. It’s fixed. If you have a problem with that, go and sort it out. No sorting out. I will talk to Sastry. -Talk to Sastry! Do talk to Sastry. What do I care? Is he my tutor or something? Of course, I will talk to him. -Do it. -I will. She is coming. Talk to her. Settle the matter. Hey, Eddie, mixing Vodka with whisky…is criminal. -I will talk to Sastry. -Jay… Hello! No more personals, Jay. -Uh, sir. Just focus on the mission. Please try to understand, sir. -It’s an order. -Sir! I kept saying no yet he wanted the campfire under him. I think it’s burning. How are your parents? Good. They are fine. I have been watching you, Jay. Jay, listen! That was a mission. And so is this. -Forget what happened and -You had cheated me. How do I trust you? I can’t work with people I don’t trust. I am forced to now. At least, this time… don’t break my trust, please. Please. -What is the status? -We got fresh info from the Embassy. Our borders are closing in another fifteen minutes. Jay, we can expect the truck now. Sir! -Please check this thoroughly. -Okay, sir. Ten minutes of footage is missing from the T-Branch sir. Even in the Security footage, the old one is playing in loop. Our asset is right here. -Oh! He is in this area. Let’s find out. -Let’s go. Sir, do you know where Masood stays? Jay, we found the truck. Are you sure it’s the same truck? -Yes, it is. Stop! Stop! Stop the vehicle! Okay, fine! It will be done. I’m coming! Okay! Stop! Stop! Hey! Hold on! He lives in this area. -Hey! Masood! Let’s catch him! Quick! Vaishnavi, he is coming towards you. Cut him off. Guys, I am hit. I am on the bend. Take a shot. Come on. Shoot it, come on! Is it internal breach? Don’t know, sir. To whom did you transfer the bitcoin? One of them gets me the file. I had orders to transfer it to him. Who is the Indian? -I don’t know the details. I do not have time. So, think before you speak. He is wearing a Blue hoodie. He took the money and left for the airport. Sir, a guy in blue hoodie seemed to meet Masood. He is on his way back to the airport now. Do you have any other information? You might get the rest of information after you catch him, sir! Okay. -Now, you just get hold of him. -Right away. Yeah! Immediately. Check those files. Eddie! Go and check the cctv footage. -Find some clues. -Okay, sir. Stop them! Stop them! Stop! Stop madam! -Leave us! Let us get him. -We can’t allow you, please! -Go back. -Please! Please, leave us. -Please, mam! No, no. - No, ma’am. -He is an accused. -We can’t allow you! -We have to catch him. Leave! -Let us go! Oh, god! India’s best kept secret is missing. We... we lost him, sir. Sir! The truck is empty. We lost the information of the vehicle. I think we have a mole, sir. -I know! Get back to the base! -Okay, sir. Indian agents chased after our empty truck. File will reach us in two days. Okay! Jay! When you were on the mission, Netaji’s file went missing here. Do we keep files on leaders as well? Not really. We also have a leader. Some called him Baba. Some called him Bhagavanji. And some… called him Anonymous Baba. Jay! I am talking about... India’s best kept secret. And the most respected man... in our closed rooms… Creator of Azad Hind Fauj. Visionary and one and only… Subhash Chandra Bose! And the files between 1942 and 1947 are missing. But… But didn’t he die in a plane crash in 1945? Might be a coverup story! Is Stalin killing… What need would Stalin have to kill Netaji? They are all made-up stories. That’s all. Then? According to Mukherjee Commission 21 to 29 witnesses had testified. Bhagavanji him self is Netaji… But… the case was struck off in 2004 because the DNA didn’t match. When it was appealed again in 2020, they called it classified information and didn’t release it, sir. Even his ashes were not handed over to his family. Was there anything about it in history? The history books which are calling Bhagat Singh a revolutionaly terrorist… why would they tell anything about this? But… what would Khadir do with Netaji’s files? These files were declassified in 2019. But…they didn’t give access to the public. A key file out of them went missing. What could be in the file… or what Khadir plans to do with that information, we also don’t know it yet. History never tells us the truth. It hides it. We must find the answer. Sir! Where did the blue hoodie go? We accessed the ATC records, sir. He is off to Jordan. Did you find the asset there? -Yes, sir. Blue hoodie guy is the mole. You go to Jordan. Find the missing file. And kill Khadir. [both]: Yes, sir. -Dismiss. Yes, sir! -Jay… -Sir! Our history is in your hands. Remember the Samurai story. Yes, sir. We have to collect weapons from Akram! Kamal, we are using this. Have we come to shoot birds? How do we manage with this gun? Don’t worry, I will take care. Don’t keep saying ‘I will take care’ for everything. Like a possessive boyfriend! Guys, Khadir is here. He is going to meet someone at King Abdulla Mosque at ten in the morning. Since there will be no one on those premises at prayer time, I think we can take him down there. Kamal will use the drone and monitor the entire operation from a block away. Akram, monitor the CC TV footage of the entire city. Saraswathi! Stay in this block with Akram. Will reach in another ten minutes. Vaishnavi! Be at the key exit of the city. Arrange a car for Vaishnavi at the end of this block. Sure. Jay, I am in position. From this very terrace, I will take down Khadir with a sniper. What is the exit plan? Split after the job. You will go to Spain by sea and reach India by flight. Our informers are all around the mosque. They will inform us in case of some disturbance. Let’s go. -Let’s go. This is the only memory left of him. -Jay… -Huh? -Are you okay? -Yeah. What’s with this Indian flag, Jay? It’s not just a flag. It’s my brother. And he is always with me. Switch on your screen, Jay. -Hmm. Okay. He may reach in another five minutes. Sir, this is the footage related to the person who went to Myanmar. We got it from the Gangtok International airport data base. He covered his face quite cleverly. But he was caught at one spot. On time! Good job, Eddie. Two minutes, guys. Get ready. Jay! Tanya… Vaishnavi, follow her. Jay! What? Now? Jay, focus on the mission. Jay, not right now! Trust me. Just do it. Akram! Which seat is Khadir on? He is in the front seat on the right. Take the drone closer. Jay, that will only alert him. Akram, tell your guys to create some diversion. The car must stop exactly on the mark. You go! Thirty seconds. Jay, I can see the convoy. Copy. Stop the car! Two minutes, sir! Jay, the car’s engine is turned off. Get up! Go! Guys, secure the file… and kill him. Vaishnavi, ask her about Subhash. Jay! Jay, focus on the mission. Tell me! I am a dancer. For helping Subhash in his mission, I was supposed to get a pass to India. But no one came from there. That’s why I am hiding from people here. I have been waiting here for him for the past five years. Who killed Subhash? Subhash shouted after killing Khadir. At whom? I couldn’t hear the name. -Then? I…I just heard the gun shot. Who shot him? Sir, it’s depixelating! No idea. The men who came with him on his mission… Oh, my goodness! Jay, Khadir is in position. If you have the visual, take the shot. Don’t lose your senses. Get in, get in, sir! Tanya has reached Spain, Jay. Akram spoke to the Indian Embassy and got her shelter. How did Khadir resurface? I don’t know. What happened to Netaji's file? There are many things you are not aware of, Jay. Why did you kill Subhash? I didn’t kill him. Tell me! -Hit me as you like, but you won’t hear anything different. -I didn’t kill Subhash! -Who killed him then? Tanya had seen you in the tent. Speak! Speak up! Hey, give me the gun! Speak! -Jay! -Sastry sir ordered you to stay away. -Calm down! I’ll kill you! Jay! -Jay! Calm down! Don’t let Jay near him! I’m coming right now! He is trained like you and me. He will bite his tongue off before opening his mouth. Jay! Kuldeep is running away! -That way! -Did he go that way? Come on. Kuldeep, stop! Hey, no, no! -Kuldeep, don't move. No, no. -Or we will have to shoot you. Kuldeep! Don’t shoot! Let go, Jay! -You can’t escape. Drop the gun. Jay… Jay! Calm down. Easy. Crap! You have destroyed our only link to reach Khadir. Are you out of your mind? Sir, he was about to shoot you, sir. You could have talked him out of it. You had an option, Jay! He is of no use, sir. He has no information. You always act in haste! That’s exactly why I asked you to remember the story of Samurai. A Samurai is never emotional but duty bound. You are very… fragile and unstable, Jay. That’s why you killed Kuldeep for your personal revenge. No, sir. -Yes! You have failed this entire nation and placed every Indian life at risk! Someone like you doesn’t fit in RAW. You are dismissed! You will face court martial for killing Kuldeep. Be ready with your explanation. Saraswathi! Lead this mission from now. You are done. Hmm. You should have thought so deep before shooting him. We didn’t join RAW to act in haste. Why did you shoot him? He was a traitor. -Traitor? It’s only traitors we deal with. Do we keep shooting them? Shouldn’t we know where they might come in useful? How did you miss that? We got all the information we needed. Why do we need him? -Information? What is that? What is this location? The last location Kuldeep searched for before taking off. If he was going there, there must be some clue in the location. I must go there. Alone? Yeah. Have you left your mind in the fridge? Will you go there and say, ‘Hi! I am Jay. From Raw.’ And give them your business card? No way we are sending you there alone. Okay? -Hey! I have been a part of your every stupid escapade since childhood. No way I am leaving you alone. Let her go if you want. Hey, I have been dismissed. If you two go with me, you will be at risk. Ever since I said hi to you, my life has been at risk. This is nothing new. Either three of us go or none. What do you say, Vaishnavi? I thought you were like any other guy. Or any other agent. But…this guy's anguish for his brother as a person, and fervour for the nation as an agent I didn’t see it in anyone else. That’s what I like in you. I trust you, Jay. But you need my help now. You need me more. Fine. Let’s go together. You lectured on some rules, protocol, etc at Khatmandu. What trust now? What does he find in this girl? Worst taste in girls! Worst! Hello, I came to India. Yes, sir! Khadir has come to India, Sastry! I will look into immediately, sir! Yes, sir! Eddie! -Sir! Stop all the works and Inform all our agents in the den… and send the orders immediately to arrest Khadir Khan wherever he is. I must find Netaji’s files immediately. Provide our agents with whatever details or resources they require. Okay, sir! -Come on! Go! What is this? Why did it stop behind a building? That’s good. It didn’t run into the lake in front. That’s what the maps show. This is not some building. This is the building. Vaishnavi, heat scan the entire building. -Hey! -Hmm? -Do a recce. -Hmm. Wait! Everyone in there has weapons except this one. Something is fishy. Hey! This is the building! But I don’t know how many of them. They are thirty. How do you know? Ah! Technology! How? Only experienced agents have access. Oho! So, do I need to get a certificate from Ameerpet to gain access? Fine. What is the plan? Vaishnavi will be guiding us. -Hmm. You and I will go in. Hey, they are thirty in there and we have only two bullets. How? Like this. Do you have pepper spray? -Hm. I don’t need it. -Here. Happy Women’s Day. Do you remember our Chemistry lab? Tear gas. -Yeah. Jay! Shh…! On the floor! Hands up! -Hands up! Down! On the floor! Please, don’t kill me. I beg you. Why is he so scared? I was expecting massive action! Please, don’t kill me, sir. I beg you. I beg you. Don’t kill me. Khadir Khan? Global terrorist? Why is he jumping to Pushpa’s song? Who the heck are you? I was offered money to play Khadir Khan, sir. I am an actor, sir. Batur from Balochistan. Batur… Balochistan… But what about Pushpa’s songs? I am a fan of Pushpa sir. Of course, he has fans all over the world. Why not? Damn! He is not Khadir. He is a body double. Hey, are you fake? Made in China? Who sent us the video then? Oh, this video? Shabbir had given me a script, sir. I read it and did in a single take, sir. I did a good job, didn’t I, sir? -Hey! Kamal Haasan! -Thank you, sir. Thank you. -A very good job. -You are very appreciative. I will kill you right now! Okay? I am going to kill you! Please, sir. Please, sir. Netaji’s file must be here. -Hey, Kamal! -Huh? This photo looks very familiar. Photograph...? Hey! Are you trying to be clever? What did you do? What did he do? He switched on the alarm. -Sir, sir. -Get the hell out of here! Don’t hurt me, sir. Sir! Go and cover. Sir, please don’t harm me, sir. Sir… Shabbir! They want to take me. Kill them. Kill them! You will die! -Hello! -Hmm? -Hello! -Hmm? Where did you find this burger? It was lying in the car. So, I took it. Won’t you even ask when it is from? I am hungry. Don’t you have burgers in Balochistan? Oh, sorry. There is food shortage in Pakistan, right? Sorry, Sorry. Have it! Sir! Do you have Coke? Coke… coke… you want coke? -Yes. Take it. Have your coke. Drink it. Hey, use the age progressing app and show how this girl would look at 25. That calls for a lot of dedication. That means no distraction. Hey, face the wall. Do your job. Hey! This is the Passport girl from Sri Lanka. Are we still tracking her? Hmm! Nice Kheer! You are a Master Chef! Don’t try to run away. She will catch you before you step into the elevator. I guess you have become an expert at making fake passports. Sachi Patel. Daughter of Keshubhai Patel. Nice name. Perfect fake passport. But… …who is the girl next to Khadir Khan in this photo? Uh, I don’t know. Don’t you? He is my dad. Abdul Rahman. Dad was a Nuclear Physicist. Ishan Imtiaz Award Winner. I know. But how is he connected to Khadir? Everyone knows Khadir as a businessman supplying guns to terrorist organizations. But I know him as a childhood friend of my dad’s. When we enquired about your father, we were told he was the dirty scientist… who worked with Khadir Khan! That’s our misfortune. Despite umpteen research papers and several Ph.Ds, his project wasn’t funded. Hello, this is Dr Rahman. I submitted my papers… I know, sir. Don’t call me again. I wanted to bring glory to Pakistan. But no one… No one cares about science in this country. We are enslaved to USA and China forever. If we want to grow, we need more scientists in this country. Not guns and violence. When all options had failed, my dad applied to MIT for research. He got a job. His VISA was cleared too. But… As nothing was working out despite his best efforts, my father considered himself a failed scientist and sold a tech to someone on Dark Web. When the Pakistan government discovered this, they tried their best to cover it up. But your Indian RAW exposed the matter to the world. The team that was behind this exposure was led by your brother, Subhash, My father began to hate India and RAW for destroying his identity. When we thought our life was over, someone brought my dad home on bail. How are you? I am alive. Don’t worry. I will fund your research. Dad’s designs made Khadir Khan stronger. But I don’t get the respect I deserve. Samina, I want to occupy Khadir’s position. To achieve that, I got to do certain things. I need some time to do it. Until then, we cannot meet. Dad decided that he had no value unless he occupied Khadir’s chair. Kuldeep met him. My dad started following Kuldeep’s instructions. I cannot do anything. Dr Rahman, only you can. Yes. -But how? Your friend will come home in a few days. Do as I tell you. I will take care of the rest. My dad started working for India. He even passed information from time to time. A few days later, there was news of Khadir’s death. -If Abdul Rahman had killed Khadir… Who is this Khadir? Like Saddam and Laden, they say Khadir also has seven body doubles. Only the name is Khadir. But it is my dad in his place. But why did he blast New York? He is so cruel. To kill a doctor involved in surgery, he blew up an entire station. Why can’t Abdul Rahman take Khadir’s position? Why is he using Khadir’s name and his body double? Khadir is not a person. He is an idea. Today, it’s my dad who is using that idea. Tomorrow, it will be someone else. A person can die. But an idea? You know the rest. Where is your father now? -I don’t know. He is planning an attack on India. He also has the classified files. You can’t stop him. Because dad is a master mind. He is always ten steps ahead. So, there is no chance of him making a mistake. I will make him do it. Hey, why should we believe what she says? Once we are done with your dad, we will release you. Till then, enjoy your stay. Is there any update from IB? -No, mam! Any suspicious activity in border? No, mam! We need to act fast! Did you find out where Khader is? No, sir! You don’t know where Khader is? You don’t know where Netaji’s file is? Nuclear attack could happen at any moment. Do you have an answer for these? No! Saraswathi! I don’t want an explanation… Khadir and Netaji’s file! Do you understand? -[all]: Yes, sir! Lourder! -Yes, sir! What is it? One of our agents is helping him, sir. Who is it? Eddie! Play the video. -Okay! The NIA drug bust in Bangalore. The advanced weapons that we found here. It shows that Kadhir Khan is behind this. Saraswathi! Declare Jay as a rogue agent. Inform all the agencies to arrest Jay. And if he doesn’t cooperate, kill him on the spot! What the hell is happening, Jay? Huh? What happened? Your video with Khadir Khan is being circulated in the media. Someone has morphed you and is framing you, Jay Mo…morphed? That’s not morphed. What do you mean morphed? It’s a 4K HD video, man! What? Sastry sir has declared you a rogue agent. All the agencies are hunting for you. If you don’t co-operate for the arrest, there are orders to kill you, Jay. Perfect! -What? Perfect? Hey, they are not giving you a bravery award. It’s your death warrant. Somebody has to put their head in the line. It was me who leaked the video. You took a great risk, Jay. It’s we. We took the risk. Not he. Couldn’t help it. I am sure Abdul Rahman would be watching this video now. He will definitely break his radio silence… and either call or message to Khadir's in-charge, Shabbir. I placed a tracker in Shabbir's mobile! Eddie, if you can trace the message and give us the location of the ping, he is as good as caught. -No. If they find I was helping you, I would be facing the risk, Jay. Eddie, please! Just one last favour, man. Okay! Thank you so much, Eddie. I will send you the phone details you must track. We don’t have much time. Hey, your phone. They will trace it. Careful. This! Only that is left now! Inform sir that Batur is kidnapped. I cannot do that. I can tell sir only when he calls me. Hey, has he messaged? Patience. Sir… do you have a burger? We have bitter gourd. What do you think is happening here? A food festival? Go and sit! It’s okay, sir! He wants a burger as soon as he gets up. Message received! Jay! Eddie, track the location. I sent you the location. Check. Before it could be traced, Abdul Rahman’s satellite phone went off, Jay. What is the probable radius? Five kilometres. Are you sure it’s in Imphal? Confident. Eddie! Connect me to Sastry. -What? Why do you want the Principal now? Connect me! Sir! Jay is on the line. Yes? Sir, he is not Khadir Khan. He is Abdul Rahman, the dirty scientist. He got a surgery done for an actor, and tricked us with his body double. He is planning an attack, sir. We must stop him. The co-ordinates are with Eddie. What nonsense, Jay? Don’t bull crap me. Just surrender. Or else… Hey, why call and then hang up? They have already issued shoot at sight orders. Damn! Don’t go behind my back again. Find Jay. Sastry sir is not going to help. Now, it’s impossible to reach the border, Jay. We can. Hey, tell us right now if you have a plan. Don’t plan a surprise like a romantic boyfriend. I will take care. Okay… But have we come so far to look at these clothes? Put on! Twenty feet! So what? What should we do now? What is all this for? Saraswathi, to get information from Kuldeep, release him. Okay, Jay! Guys! He is our senior. Arjun. Hi, I’m Kamal! -There is no time to greet. -Hi, I am Vaishnavi. If we survive, we will meet again. Get in! What’s the mission? Abdul Rahman’s last seen co-ordinates, …found in five-kilometre radius of Imphal, senior. We have to stop him! Hey! five-kilometre radius? How will we find him in such a short time? Do you have any other option? -Okay! No! No. I have no other option. But we don't have tech support. We don't have Sastry sir's support. How will just the four of us catch him? “Target somewhere aim elsewhere” “Target somewhere and you aim elsewhere” Sir, sir, please! If you don’t mind… Can you stop singing, please? We are already frustrated with what he has done. If you continue to sing, I will jump off the helicopter. Go ahead! It’s not Imphal you should go to. Kohima. Kohima? Why, Kohima, sir? Do you know the Stalingrad of the east? No, sir. The battle of Kohima? Sir, why are you quizzing us, sir? Netaji’s classified file has gone missing. -Is Abdul Rahman in Imphal? -Yeah. The biggest ammunition dump… is in Kohima. It’s not a co-incidence. It’s a co-relation. Did Abdul Rahman find the ammunition dump made by Subhash chandra bose? It was a three month long short battle, right, sir? It was a bloody blood bath that went on for a long time. Netaji crossed Singapore, Malaysia and Burma and entered Kohima. IMPHAL 22 MILES Unaware of this, our Indian soldiers fought against our own people. They spread false news that Netaji died in the war. They wanted to hang Netaji's commanders. They were the Red Fort Trials! I.N.A TRIALS OPEN IN RED FORT MAJOR GENERAL BLAXLAND AND MEMEBERS OF THE COURT MARTIAL SHRI BHULABHAI DESAI(LEADER) AND MEMBERS OF THE DEFENCE COUNSEL ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE TRIAL MRS NAIDU WITH MRS DHILLON ON HER LEFT Every soldier was enraged. Every Indian had stepped forward. Only one slogan was resounding then. India says in one voice… Sahgal, Dhillon, Shahnawaaz! It happened then. The naval mutiny. They chronicled it as a revolt. But it was a revolution! Our last war against the British. We got independence because of that. But they say India got independence because of non-violence. Who would accept that we thrashed them and took freedom? That’s why they say they have ‘given’ it. I didn’t say this. Netaji said this. “Freedom is not given. It is taken.” If this happened in some other country, they would have declared every life lost in the Kohima battle as a fallen soldier’s and honoured them. Unfortunately, forget the recognition. The departed were not even given pension. No one would die for their own family. But for the one call that Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose gave… “Give me blood and I shall give you freedom!” For that single call! Lakhs of soldiers who came forward… The lives they had sacrificed… Their kids who were orphaned… Those who had the mad dream to see our national flag flying high, it was a freedom they never witnessed… a freedom that those who are born now don’t know the value of… I don’t mean to find fault with Gandhiji or Mr Nehru. I don’t have a problem with the ones who got the credit. I have a problem with the ones who didn’t. We are here. Take your weapons. Senior, we need you. This is not the only battle we are fighting, Jay. Go! Jay! A blood drenched land… The cornerstone of a 75 year old freedom. If it has beckoned you again… Live for it. Here! Good luck! -Thank you! This blood shed land Beckons you again That war is the base of freedom And death has no significance Remember the value of life that proved this And recall its courage In every step that you take Find the stories of yester warriors On this land of blood shed O, blood! Worn like vermilion! Be the proof of a history hidden -Soldiers! -And proceed as its witness The reflection of this nation -Azad Hind Fauj -Get ready! “Give me blood I shall give you freedom!” “Give me blood I shall give you freedom!” “Give me blood I shall give you freedom!” “Give me blood I shall give you freedom!” Establishing peace through war is revolution Let the generation inherit such freedom Live as if you are the sagfeguard in defense Life is the only weapon even today The aim is only one The whole country under our command Let it be known the pride of the flag that's yours and mine Bahgavan ji is our Bose And the pride of our flag Bahgavan ji is our Bose Endless is our India “Give me blood I shall give you freedom!” “Give me blood I shall give you freedom!” “Give me blood I shall give you freedom!” “Give me blood!” “Give me blood!” Jay! There are sleeping quarters here. Azad Hind Fauj! Bunkers used by INA soldiers. Jay, missile parts! World War II time. These are the parts from German V2 rockets. During Kohima battle, British fighter planes attacked Azad Hind Fauj. To destroy those fighter planes, Subhash Chandra Bose along with the Indian engineers, set up a secret missile center in the shortest time. Supposed to be a rumour back then. Maybe this is it. The same information is in the files accessed by Abdul Rahman. About the same location. So, all the stories about Bose are… Bose’s escape from a secret capsule is a rumour. If only this were completed… I have completed it. This launch station is mine, agents. Tell me the status. The nuclear missile is ready, sir. Is the uplink to the satellite done? -It’s done, sir. Show me. All set for the launch. Tell me the location co-ordinates. Welcome to India’s best kept secret. Made by Azad Hind Fauj and… yours Subhash Chandra Bose! They have reduced my job. A new launch station needs thousands of men and machinery. It’s impossible! I cannot use the launch stations in India breaching security. But to poke your eye with your own finger, I can't create a better launch station. That's why...to get hold of this launch station, I acquired Netaji's file. You ignored him and deleted him from the pages of history. Now, I am making use of him. Relax. Now witness this launch. Why attack India and kill innocent civilians? A missile launch on India? Huh? Sir! India is launching a missile? Are you sure? Premier! India is going to launch a missile attack on our country. Prepare for counter attack! Sir! Why is China attacking India? We provoked them first, sir. -Is it? That’s why China is attacking us. Please, look! This is the spot in our country the missileis going to be launched from. On whose orders? We don’t know who, sir. -What? You cannot win this war. Pakistan lost three wars to you. We failed in Uri as well. And I became a joke. There is only one way to destroy India. War against another powerful country like China. What do you people think of me? Huh? Do you take me for a terrorist who blasts a small railway station or a theatre? Huh? I am Abdul Rahman! A Nuclear Scientist. How did you think I would spare RAW that had destroyed my identity? The war I am going to start will destroy India. You people will bite the dust. Sir… the PM is on the line, sir. Millions will die if a war breaks out. People won’t recover for decades and generations. I won’t let such situation arise. We must avert this war. At any cost. On your orders, we will bomb the place. That area has missiles. Bombing there will cause heavy damage, sir. Above all, there will be radiation poisoning. Lots of people in the vicinity will die. In a way, we are ordering to kill our own men! If we consider the thousand people there, millions will be affected. It’s collateral damage, sir. Inevitable. Please, give your orders, sir. Our forces are ready, sir! Ask them to reach LAC! These co-ordinates match exactly with the co-ordinates from Jay, sir. Where is he? Last communication was from this location, sir. Go ahead with the air strike on the location. -Yes, sir! Sir! My agents are at the location. Jay and his team tried to communicate about the location to me. I had disregarded it. But…they are right. Sastry, it is already proved they are rogue agents. They are the best of the lot, sir. That’s why orders don’t stop them. There is only one driving force behind them, sir. Duty. They fight against all orders to save one thing! India! They are ready to kill and get killed for the country. Because they belong to RAW. And they are my Samurais. Give me five minutes, sir. My team will stop the launch of the missile. Five minutes. Just five minutes, Sastry. Thank you, sir! Hey, Jay! Last time, I think it was your brother that I found to be as weak as you. I enjoyed killing him. ‘Fennec, come in. Fennec, come in’ [SINGNAL LOST] Why did you shoot? There should be proof that RAW killed Khadir. So, either of you must die. I chose him. Because you are my friend. Misbah, how much time left? Two minutes, sir. Sir, four minutes are over. Come on. Come on, Jay! Sir! It will be too late. Go ahead. Yes, sir! Deploy Garuda 4. Stay on the com. Kicking the fires. Feet wet. Will reach the location in two minutes. -Copy! Our troops are at LAC, sir! Order to attack India! Not yet! Let India attack first! Jay! Not able to override the manual. Missile locked! -Copy. Jay! Fighter jet! A missile is locked on us. Kamal, look for override. -Locked out! Damn! Are you okay? Hey, this is old technology. If the switch fails, there must be a lever to stop the missile launch. Where is it? There’s no time to find it. We got to stop this missile launch. -Jay! Over there! I will take care of it. You guys get out of here. Hey! Are you crazy? Jay… Once you step in, you won’t be able to come out, Jay. What will you take care of? You guys go out and stop the jets! Orders to launch! -Go for launch. Garuda command! -Yes? I see something, sir. What? Who is that? Looks like an Indian flag. Sir! Someone is waving the Indian flag. Abort… abort the mission. Abort. Abort! Copy, sir! Sir! Missile stopped! Abort the mission! Jay, did it! How did you get out? I thought you won’t get out. Thank God! You are safe. Hello! Hello… What is it? Are you two done? Out… how did you get out? Only when we run out of all options we look for another way out. There was a secret capsule in the launch station. Secret capsule! How? Mr Bose… isn’t that what he taught us? Survive! And when everything else fails, have a Plan B. I noticed there was a secret exit the moment we got in. Let’s go. -Let’s. Finally, we did it! Yeah! -Yeah! Subhash Chandra Bose! The name that fought for a belief. A reference for revolution. A personification of freedom. Dream for tomorrow. Fight every minute. You must first live in order to win. That’s the kind of inspiration he gave the future generations. This is… the Netaji I perceive. Kamal! Where is Jay! I don’t know. He has been acting strange after the mission. He didn't even come to receive the Prime Minister's Medal. Hmm. Wonder where he is and what he is up to. Hey! -Huh? Jay! Yo! What’s happening? Jay! -Hmm. Why didn’t you receive the medal? Mission is more important than medals. We could stop a war against India. What else do I want? What’s in the file? Bhagwanji’s file. -What? Didn’t you submit it yet? -No! What’s in it? Tell us, Jay. Some truths are best left alone. Okay! Let’s go! It’s time for the flight! Where to? Kazakhstan. -Please… -Why are you laughing? Hasn’t Sastry told you yet? Hey! Amman, Sri Lanka, Nepal… and now Kazakhstan. Hey, Paris! Why can’t we go to Paris, man? People go there for honeymoon. This is mission! Let’s go! I have avenged you, dad.
