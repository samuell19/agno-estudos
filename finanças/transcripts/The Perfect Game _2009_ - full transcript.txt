[TV news show theme music] (announcer over TV) Fans here at Sportsman's are glued to their seats as the Cardinals and Dodgers are even at two apiece. Sal Maglie takes the sign from Campanella. He winds up. Here's the pitch! Whammo! Musial's bat cracks off at his fist as he sizzles one to Gil Hodges, Musial is two for two! Does anyone want a slightly used bat? [Reporter's voice begins to fade] (Cesar) I... I was promised. Promised? By who? By Eddie Stanky. Stanky's gone. Mr. Tanner, I've been working on this shot for years. You'll get other shots, but this is the Majors, and we need to bring in somebody who's... Who's what? Not Mexican? Look here, when Stanky found you you were a batboy in San Antonio. Hornsby hired you. I didn't. It's my team now, and you'll do what you're told. That's all, we're done. (Cesar) I didn't get it. Where you going? (Cesar) Monterrey, Mexico. (man) Why? That's where my folks are from. You don't know anyone there. Yeah, well I thought I knew people here. Cesar! [Soft guitar, Mexican music] [Man shouting, horns honking] [Mexican soft guitar music intensifies] [Explosion sound] By the end of the shift, I want all of this removed. (Umberto) Hey you! Boss needs this slag cleared. Sounds good. Why don't you get it done? Why don't you go back to America? (Suarez) I hear he can't. (Villareal) Maybe he killed somebody. You think you're better than us, Mr. Baseball Man? Look where it got you. You'll never know what it is to have anything 'cause you'll never have anything to lose. Cesar! A few months ago, his oldest boy was playing at the Church of the Dead. All of our boys did, but his slipped and fell. (Father Esteban) Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on Earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. Today, we command the spirit of Pedro Macias into Your hands. In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Pedro was a good boy, a very good boy. By the end of the shift. (Cesar) You want someone? Take me. These children have nothing. How can I give them hope? Thank you. [Sad music] [Turns on radio] [Tuning] (reporter over radio) And that's two outs! Brooklyn Dodger fans are on their feet for the rookie, Sandy Koufax. The poor lanky kid who rose from the streets of Brooklyn to the Major Leagues. Koufax, studies the sign... [soft epic music] (reporter over radio) He winds up. And here's the pitch. Strike three! He's done it! Koufax has just pitched his first shutout, allowing Cincinnati only two hits! What a performance, this kid has champion written all over him! Koufax studies the sign. (Father) Ugh. Mario! It's a Holy Day, not a time for games. If God didn't want us to play games, he wouldn't have made them so much fun! Right? [Chuckling] [Boy singing] Will you shut him up? I'm trying to sleep! He has to practice for choir. [Singing continues] Choir? You're turning him into a woman. You shut him up, or I'll do it myself. Why did you stop? It's all right, Mama. I'm finished. Your Father's not an evil man. He just... can't feel anymore. (Angel) Is he ever gonna get better? (mother) I don't know. Father Esteban says anything's possible with the help of God. [Boys' choir singing] (Angel) Ha! You're out! (Enrique) I tipped it! (Father Esteban) Boys. It's time. Come. (Enrique) Did so tip it. (reporter over radio) Gil Hodges steps up to the plate... (Angel) Do you think we have a chance? (Enrique) Two outs, down by three in the bottom of the 9th! Enrique, I meant this season. You know the beautiful thing about opening day is today, every team is in first place. Yankees got lucky last year. Lucky? You call Don Larson's perfect game, lucky? What's a perfect game? (Mario) No runs, no hits, no walks. No one gets to first. Yeah. [Sighs] To me, baseball is always perfect. I imagine when you look out from home plate, the field has no end. And until the final out, you can, you can play forever. [Soft music] And only God can make something infinite and eternal. Si. (radio) Snider hits a deep fly ball! Back to the wall, [all exclaim] (Father) Our Dodgers have spirit. And Duke Snider. (radio) And that's why Yogi Berra says, 'lt ain't over 'till it's over' [soft music continues] You're late. The game went into extra innings. No. You're not on time for dinner, you don't eat. You got chores to do. Tonight you can clean out the corral. It's too filthy, even for a pig. Umberto. When I was his age, I had to help put food on the table. Go! [Soft music] [Oinking] (mother) You're not going to find answers in there. (Umberto) Where then? God. (Umberto) God took my son. (mother) He sacrificed his only son! We have Angel! (Umberto) Angel will never be the son that Pedro was. Never. Angel? [Oinking] [Soft music continues] [Panting] [Coyote howling] [Boy's echoing voice] Pedro! Pedro! [Screaming] Pedro! [Birds chirping] [Music becomes more cheerful] [Sharp thud] What are you doing? I'm Sandy Koufax. The pitcher. [Musical chord] [Sharp thud] Well, Koufax, you just ruined my siesta. Koufax is a lefty. [Sharp thud] And Jewish. Yes. Yes. I'm Jew... I'm Ju... Je... [sighs] Whatever you said. Well, it hasn't improved your aim any. What do you know? Hey. [Sharp thud] (Cesar) Hey, where'd you get this? It... It's from God. You best take care of that. (Norberto) Can I touch it? (Father) Yes, of course you can touch it. [Panting] It's heavier than I thought. Let me see. Whoa. It's like a woman's skin. (Mario) Father. What does it mean? It means God wants us to play baseball. Angel. That's what I think it means. Me, too. What happens when we lose this one? Is God going to drop another one from the sky? (Angel) He's God. He can do anything. Father, what does it say? It says it belonged to a saint. (kids) Wow. Angel, maybe next time you can ask him to give us a bat! [All chuckle] [Rooster] You again. Want to have a catch? (Cesar) No. Okay, I guess I'll just have to practice everyday by myself. Every single day, right here! Everyday! [Sharp thuds] [Soft guitar music] All right. Just this once. Then you have to promise me you're going to pitch somewhere else, agreed? Wow. Who taught you to pitch? Cardinals. In the Basilica? Saint Louis. The Saint Louis Cardinals? That's right. You played in the Majors? Well, sorta, I... I coached. I'm a Dodger fan. Yeah, you're Sandy Koufax. [Man shouting and horn] [Chatter] Quiet! There she is! My girlfriend. (Ricardo) Oh yeah? Then go talk to her. Yeah. I have to wait for the right moment. How about now? Enrique, catch! Oops. A little help, please! Hi, Gloria, such a surprise! What is this? I-I-lt's a baseball. (Norberto) A real one! Are these your friends? (Ricardo) We are his teammates! Yeah, we're a real baseball team. Best in Monterrey! [Soft Mexican music] You know, they told me Monterrey had the most beautiful girls in Mexico. Too bad for you, we're on our way to America. Yeah, too bad. So Gloria, I was thinking, I could, walk you home or something?! Sorry, my father picks me up. Ooh! Popped up to the catcher. How embarrassing. Who do you think you are? We're the Mexico City All Stars. Can you read? Sons of gringo businessmen! Why don't you play with Mexicans? With babies, like you? (Mario) Who are you calling 'babies'? Dummy. Come on, guys. [Horn honking] I'll never get Gloria. (boy) You're not worth getting dirty over. We're going to America. America. Father. Sorry, but we need to make the team now. Angel, what is the hurry? We're 12. See, we can't play in the league next year. Hmm. I see. Well then, you'll need a coach. You could be our coach! No, not me. Please. You need somebody who knows the game, not just stick ball. I don't know anybody like that in Monterrey. I do. (Cesar) What now? (Angel) We are making a Little League team! Who's we? My friends and Father Esteban. You can meet him tomorrow at Mass. (Cesar) Church? I don't think so kid. [Soft sweet music] Do you like her? Who? I think you are in love. (Cesar) Nah, there's plenty of fish in the sea. [Horns honking] Not like that mermaid. You know her? (Angel) No, but I know where she'll be tomorrow morning. Where? [Bells tolling] [Soft guitar music] (Father) Mea culpa Mea culpa Mea maxima culpa [Father continues Mass in Latin] (Angel) Father Esteban, this is Cesar Faz. Ah, yes. Good morning, Father. Angel tells me you used to coach in the Major League Baseball. Yeah, yeah, I did. Well, it must have been something. It was something. (Father) Yes, well, they would like to have that same feeling, you know? In the American Little League. (Angel) Mr. Faz, will you be our coach? Will you take us to America? It would take a miracle to make these kids into a real team. Sometimes, God gives us the ability to make them. Teams? Miracles. These kids don't even have a field. Sorry, kid. [Cheerful music] (Enrique) Couldn't pick a place with more rocks, huh? Nope. - We did it. - Si. (Enrique) Yeah, the infield. What about the outfield? [Sharp thud] Angel. Angel! (Angel) Mr. Faz! [Sharp thud] Want to have a catch?! Angel. [Dogs barking] Angel. [Soft guitar music] (Angel) Well, we have a field. Yeah. You got a field. Lucky. It's Cesar. Cesar? How the heck are you? You still got your contacts in Williamsport? I need you to pull some strings, and help me get Monterrey a Little League franchise. Little League? I thought you didn't like kids. Well, you going to lecture me or you going to help me? You know that's a pretty tall order this late in the game. I watched you deck a shore patrolman and then sweet-talk him into driving you back to your ship. I know what you can do on a one-day leave. Oh, good, I didn't know I had a whole day. [Chuckling] Holler when you're hurting. Oh, I'm hollering. (Cesar) Five skills in baseball. Running, catching, throwing, hitting, [thump and all exclaim] And hitting harder. [Thump] (Father) They already know how to do all these things. They just need you to tell them when to do them. (Cesar) Wow. Um, thank you. Oops. Oh, uh. You shouldn't hold that so tightly. You'll bruise the delicate fruit inside. You were in church on Sunday, right? Yes, yes I was in church on Sunday. That was me. I'm Maria. I'm Cesar Faz. You, uh... you buy food here? [Chuckling] Yes, Cesar Faz, it's a food market. Right. And what do you do here? I'm here scouting for the team. Oh, what kind of team? Little League baseball! Here? In Monterrey? First time for everything, right? Like Cesar Faz coming to my church. That's right. Yeah. Well, that's all I came for. Yeah, we, you and I, uh, should go out? (Maria) Um, would you like to join my family for dinner, tonight? Yeah. Yeah. Tonight? Mm-hm. Yeah. That sounds real nice. 7 o'clock then? 7 o'clock. Bye. Father. [Sighs] What are you guys doing here? Recruiting, remember? I think Mr. Faz has been recruiting. Okay, okay, who do we got? [Man shouting, horns honking] (Angel) That's Fidel Ruiz. [Man continues shouting] Man, that kid can run. Tell him it's a sin to steal. Unless it's bases. He's in. How about that kid that murdered that cardboard decoration? (both) Baltazar! He's the strongest kid in town. He's in. Okay. Angel, Enrique, Ricardo, Fidel. What about Mario? (Angel) Yes, yes, Mario's important. [Chatting] He's pretty small. Is he a great hitter? Um, not so much. Fantastic fielder? Uh, not so much. (Cesar) Mario. You got a great arm, right? Not so much. Mr. Faz. (Cesar) Why's he so special? Because he knows all the girls. [All chuckle] Mario. You got a glove? Yeah! [All chuckling] Mario, you're in. (Cesar) Okay, I want you on the field in an hour. What about the flowers? Flowers? For what? For Maria. Maybe you didn't hear that beauty, just invite me to her house for dinner. Really? Where does she live? Diego Martin number 5. And don't forget the flowers. (Father) Dear Lord, bless these boys and the field on which they play for your greater honor and glory. Father. Son. Holy Ghost. Amen. Does anybody know the Holy Trinity of baseball? (Norberto) The Father, The Son, and The Holy Ghost. Close. Home runs, RBI's, and batting averages. And they all revolve around this. [Horn honking] [Cheerful music] Looking good, Pepe. Who are you? I'm Pepe Maiz Garcia. I play left field. But coach hasn't made positions yet. Well we'll see. Boys, meet your new left fielder. [Boys exclaim] (Enrique) You think your Dad can buy your way onto the team? Money isn't everything. Yeah, well, you don't have any. And you never will. At least I'll always be able to kick your butt. (Cesar) All right everybody! Heads up! Runner on first. One out, play to second. Ready? Fidel. (Fidel) What runner Mr. Faz? There's no one on the base. Pretend. (Norberto) Yogi Berra said 90% of the game is half mental. Well I must be 100% mental to think that I could teach you kids baseball in four weeks. Baltazar! What happened? You said Baltazar. The unexpected play at the unexpected time. That's what we're training for! Nice play, girl. Come on, you kids. Keep it together. Ugh. [Kids exclaim] (Cesar) Hey! Hey! There's two kinds of players. Those who can play as a team and those who won't be on this team! You got that! Alright. Everybody, five laps. It was their fight, we shouldn't all have to run five laps! Norberto's right. Everybody, ten laps! Move it! [Boys complain] You all rise and fall together! [Cheerful music] What am I doing? Again! (Cesar) Again! Make sure you get it! Grounder! What are you doing? Mr. Faz, you have a date! Get back to your position! Go! Again! [Sad love song over radio] [Rooster and cheerful Mexican music] (Cesar) Anyone jogging's going to make the whole team run an extra five laps, and I know you don't want that. You want to be a champ, you got to run like a champ. [Music continues] Come on, keep up, Ricardo. (Cesar) Way to go, Norberto. (Maria) I don't know what men do in America, but in Mexico, they treat a woman with more respect. Sorry. Practice ran late, and running the boys... Perhaps you just forgot. Mr. Faz, here are the flowers you got for the lady yesterday. Flowers? You got this for me? I... I know you told me to put them in water, they're a little wilted. They're beautiful. [Clears throat] Um, Mario. Your laps. Oh! Because I didn't put the flowers in the water, right!! It's okay.

(Cesar) Are they praying? (Father) No, they're watching that hummingbird. (Cesar) Why? (Father) I told them when they see his wings they can hit any pitch. You don't really believe that, do you Father? They do. On the field! Five minutes! Nine of you boys showed up but only one team is going to McAllen. [Boys exclaim, inspiring music] (boy) I got fourteen! [Horn] (Cesar) I'll make up the two shifts next weekend. Two shifts? And you'll be back next weekend? I will be back. [Walla and metallic clanking] (Umberto) Stop filling Angel's head with crazy ideas. Like what? Like going to Texas to play baseball. He needs to know his place. Like where, here? Working the furnaces at Fundidora? Fundidora feeds my family. My Father and Grandfather worked here, and so will Angel. Well maybe Angel's got his own dreams, you ever think about that? Dreams don't build cities. Men and iron do. (mother) You make a very handsome baseball star. Umberto. [Soft Mexican music] Where does he think he's going? To Texas with the team, remember? I don't remember saying you can go. Umberto. Papa, I'm going. Why not? One less mouth to feed for a few days. Come on, we're late for the bus. Si. [Soft guitar music] (border guard) Purpose of your visit to the United States? Baseball game in McAllen. That's over ten miles away. There's no bus stop here. They're used to walking. Hey, empty those out! [Cesar speaking Spanish] (border guard) One pair of underwear, that's all they brought? They only got one game. See that you don't leave no one behind.

Well, if that don't beat all. [Laughing and chattering] We going to play baseball with them? Or use them as fertilizer? They'll never get past the first game. Let's go. [Announcer over speakers] Angel, Enrique, I want you to line up right here. [Coach speaking Spanish] Look at who we're playing. It will be a good warm up for the tournament. [Chuckling] Now listen, you both worked really hard, but only one of you can start. You decide. (Mexico City player) Hey, babies, where's your pretty girl now? [Mexico City players laughing] You know what? You start. For Gloria. (Father) Come here, boys. Everybody join hands. Holy cow, they're holding hands. They're saying a prayer. (Father) Lord, bless these boys, let them come out victorious and get a lot of hits, okay? They need to. (announcer) Enrique Suarez, delivers, and Donowitz swings, hits a high fly ball, Pepe Maiz is under it and makes the catch! [Boys exclaim] [Boys shouting and soft Mexican music] Yeah. [Thud and shouting] Hey, coach! Might want to remind your boys there's more than one out in a baseball game. It's their first rodeo. They'll catch on. Laughing and shouting] Yeah! (announcer) Bottom of the fifth, and Veragosa digs in. (crowd) Oh! (Coach) Time! What are you kids doing? Take the base. (announcer) Monterrey's Coach Faz is coming out to the mound. We're playing a great game. We're only losing by two runs. The only word I heard in that sentence was "losing." They're bigger than us. Everybody's bigger than us. We walked 12 miles and played five innings of baseball. Lucky for you there is six innings. (Mario) But Mr. Faz, they're the Mexico City All Stars! [Suspenseful music] Wrong. They're the Yankees. And you're the mighty Brooklyn Dodgers. The mighty who? You heard me! Gil Hodges, get back to first base. Duke Snider, center field. Roy Campanella, behind the plate. Don Newcombe, take the mound. Pee Wee Reese? Third base. [Suspenseful music continues] [Boys exclaiming] Strike! Strike Two! Strike Three! Side is out. (announcer) Top of the sixth, Monterrey still down by two. Three more outs, and Monterrey Industrials will be going home. Safe! [Suspenseful music continues] (announcer) Boy have the tables turned, three more outs and it'll be the Mexico City All Stars going home. Hey! You're out! (announcer) Two outs, and Veragosa is Mexico City's last hope, he swings, he hits a high pop up. No. I got it. (announcer) And Monterrey Industrial wins their first game by 7 runs! Now we play for Mexico. We'll make your team proud. [Boys exclaiming] (Mexico City player) Okay, then do it. [Applause and cheering] (boys) Mexico All Stars! We are the Monterrey Industrials! Viva Mexico! (announcer) It's a good thing they're celebrating today, because tomorrow they're gonna face our Texas boys, for some real American baseball. Alright, we got a big game tomorrow. I want you boys to rest up, get plenty of sleep. [Groaning] Oh, when did this happen? Last Saturday. On the field, I stepped on a glass. (Fidel) Oh! Does it hurt? (Norberto) Yes. Why didn't you tell anybody? I was afraid you wouldn't let me come. You're not going to be able to play on this foot. Then I will play on the other. [Soft music] You'll play on the other. (Fidel) It's okay, Norberto. You'll be all right. (Cesar) In case you wondered what those things are that I lugged from Monterrey, they're called bats. And if you want to put numbers on that scoreboard, these are your tools. Time for some hitting drills. Mr. Faz, the game is in one hour. Well what a perfect time then. Come on. [Soft music] Batting practice? Who do y'all think you're messing with here, huh? (Mac) Disinterested. No opinion. Don't care. [Typing] Request denied. Denied. One more sec. Mac. May provoke a nuclear arms race in space. Arms race in space? Come on, Frankie. What's next? Men on the moon? It's good stuff, Mac. Besides, it's my day off. Yeah about that, I need you to cover a Little League game. Our team's got a chance at the tournament. A kid's baseball game? No. Riley's your sports writer. His wife's expecting any minute. Well what about Hayne? Got him working on the Governor Daniels story. Well, you got plenty of other men on your staff, don't you? I hear you know more about the game than any of them. Ain't you named after a ballplayer? I hate baseball. What are you, some kind of communist? Yeah, you got me, that's why I work here for next to nothing. Hm. [Sighs] Fine. What's so important about this game? We got some boys come up from Mexico thought we'd play the invasion angle, you know, our boys defending what their Granddaddy's fought for. And what if the Mexicans win? 5 will get you 20 those boys ain't gonna to score a single run. I did not study journalism to get stuck on this back page assignment. I'm not doing it, and that's final. That's fine, not everybody is cut out for the Gazette. Why don't you run out and get yourself an apron, maybe, find a husband. You know, you say that one more time, I will punch you in the nose. It's been awhile since I fought a woman. We're not in the same weight class, I don't think. 3 o'clock. McAllen field! I take that as a yes? [Boys shouting] Well, at least we know they didn't bring any ringers. Heck, they don't look but nine or ten. Hey guys, see this thing! Hey, come on, Jake, give it back. What do you care? (coach) There now, boys. Sportsmanship. Come on. Come on, get in there. (coach assistant) Let's go. [Applause] Remember, you're the pitcher. Birds and sky, the waters and rivers, even the sun is going to wait, 'till you're ready, understand? Okay, Mr. Faz. You can do this, Koufax. (announcer) We're ready to get started here on field one as Bobby Lampkin will lead things off for McAllen against Monterrey's Angel Macias. (man) Come on there, Billy! Strike! That's all right. That's only one strike. (coach) Let's go, Billy! [Soft lively Mexican music] (umpire) Strike three! That's only one out. Strike three! Strike three! Side out. That's all right! That's only one inning boys! Come on boys, let's get this one! Let's go! (coach) Come on, boys. [Music continues] They scored a run. They scored again. (announcer) Well I'll tell you, these Mexicans may have rolled all over the grass, but they sure ain't rolling over on the field. Oh, tell me they're going to stop scoring runs. Don't worry. Ain't no Mexican team gonna take our flag! That's right! [Thump] You can't be serious letting a bunch of wetbacks get the better of you! We're doing the best we can. Well maybe that just ain't enough. Hey boy! I'm talking to you! Dad, I'm on deck! Remember, boys! It ain't over 'till it's over! Strike three! That's game. No no no! It ain't over! This ain't over! It's over. (Frankie) A combination of clutch hitting, and impermeable defense led Monterrey Industrial to an improbable 7 to 1 victory. So there's your article. I'm going home. (Mac) No, you're going to stay with this story. But the home team's out. So? The wetbacks winning sells more papers. Can't be long, just cover them 'till they lose. Frankie Stevens, McAllen Gazette. No thanks. I'm not selling them. I'm a reporter. Cesar Faz. What are you gawking at? I didn't know there were female sports reporters. You must be pretty unwelcome in the locker room. And beating the home team makes you about as popular as a skunk at a lawn party. Well I'd rather smell than lose. Maybe you can do both tomorrow. You mind if I ask them a few questions? They don't speak English. How come the kids keep saying 'Gil Hodges'? And he just told those girls that he's Duke Snider. That's their secret weapon. What is? But... [chatter] Everybody gather round. (Fidel) We're tired, Mr. Faz. (Baltazar) Can we sleep? Well, if you lose tomorrow you'll get plenty of sleep on the bus home, now gather round. [Boys grumble] Now base hits to the right, shortstop covers second base. Mario. [Triumphant music] Again! He's out. Man! Come on. [Crowd complains] Jesus. (announcer) Texas just can't get it going here. Strike three, that's game. Are you kidding me? (announcer) That's 3 straight wins for Monterrey. I don't envy West Waco who'll try to stop them tomorrow. Why the long face? Our visas have expired. Oh my gosh, it's Wednesday. Yeah. (Cesar) She's gonna kill me. [Sighs] 'The Little Giants.' Nice touch. 'The little giants from Monterrey beat West Waco 'and Brownsville by the scores of 13-1, and 6-1, 'giving them five straight victories. Now it's off to Corpus for these Mexican baseballers.' For someone who hates baseball you sure have a way with it. You got your story, Mac, now leave me alone. (Mac) Hm. [Music chord] Why are you looking at me like that? Corpus Christie, huh? No! That's where I draw the line! Just 'till they lose. You said that four games ago! They're not cooperating. People are glued to the sports page. You know, if it's so good, why don't you cover it? I sign your check. Remember. Me editor. You writer. Consider that a bonus. Don't spend it all in one place. Umberto. Listen to this. Steel won't wait. Let's go. Let's go. 'Corpus Christie, Texas. August 6th. 'The pitching duet of Enrique Suarez and Angel Macias 'continued its winning streak. ' Laredo was the first to fall in a 5-0 shut out, 'West Columbia fared even worse, shut out by six runs! ' (Suarez) To America they go! [All cheer] (clerk) Can I help you? Eleven tickets to Forth Worth, please. (clerk) I got reservations here under the name 'West Columbia. ' Trust me, they won't be coming. [Angel, knocking] Mr. Faz! Me and Berto have to go to the toilet! I might get the restroom key, please? There's one about a half mile up the road. You're kidding. Well, what about that restroom out there! Can't your boys read? (Angel) Hello? Come on. We'll find another one. There's only this one. It's not working. We saw a man come out. Come on, just go. This for white people only. How does the toilet know?

Like the Mexican kids we're gonna whoop tomorrow. (Lil Betty) So that will be cheeseburgers, Coke, and a side of humble pie. (Betty) Hey, you're killing my chicken. They're, uh, making mole. It's a Mexican chocolate sauce. Mole, schmole, I ain't letting them make sundaes out of my chicken. Hey, Father. Why is that kid sitting alone? Well, Enrique, some people don't believe that we are all His children. What? Mr. Faz. Go ask the coach if the boy can sit with us. (Cesar) In this town, it ain't happening. Sorry, Angel. [Epic music] [Speaking Spanish] What is your name? Cleon. (Angel) Cleon, this is Mario and Norberto, Ricardo and Fidel. Milk. Milk. "Leche". "Leche." Yes. Yes. "Leche." One moment. [Boys chuckling] (Cleon) It's okay, here. [Cheerful rock music] Keep it, coach. It's gonna cost you money. I can't. Don't worry about it. I'm planning on charging that Houston coach double. Holy Mole! This ain't bad. Thank you, now. [Intense rock music] Come on, boys! ♫ Well, I may be little, And I sure ain't rich ♫ Safe! ♫ But like a Louisville slugger ♫ ♫ Well, rockin', rockin' Across the Rio Grande ♫ ♫ Yeah, rockin' across Texas, Rockin' to the promised land ♫ ♫ Yeah! ♫ Houston, What happened? (announcer) Well ladies and gentlemen, not since the Alamo have the Texans suffered such a defeat at the hands of the Mexicans. Pitchers Suarez and Macias cut a swath of victory through the Lone Star State. Most recently besting Houston 6-4, and bulldozing Waco 13-1, for their 8th and 9th straight victories. Next up, the Southern Regional Tournament. The Yellow Rose of Texas is smelling a little sweeter south of the border tonight. [Horns honking, man shouting] Senora Macias! Angel won again! [Laughing] Now they're going to Louisville, Kentucky! That's so far away. My son Enrique scored three goals! [All laugh] Runs, Senora Suarez, runs not goals. Ah, runs, goals, they still count!
