I will not allow his grandson, Kentaro, to take over. Making him president will be like committing corporate suicide. But, still... I'm against it too. His only grandson? So what? He'll drive us bankrupt. Our 5,000 employees and 40,000 shareholders will lose everything. We must seek Kentaro's opinion. No need. Where was he when the president was on his deathbed? The Great Japan Trading Company's Finance Department Chief... was gambling with gangsters when our president died. Yes, we must consider our reputation. Any other ideas? You, Mr. Kuroki? I was next in line for the presidency, so I shouldn't say too much. Send him to Paris! Paris? Yes, Paris, the city of flowers. I think it's the best possible place for Kentaro. Fortunately, we have a branch there. Exile him to Paris. Paris, yes, Paris! to Paris.> Enough! We're at a funeral! We, the relatives, should be in deep mourning. And you're all talking nonsense. Let met translate. Those seated here are all very distant relatives. Not one of us feels any real sorrow. All with one thought. How to get money out of Kentaro. - Don't say that. - That's quite enough! How about while he's in Paris, we take the inheritance? Paris? He has no English or German, surely no French? He hates foreign languages. He's always taunting us. Then Paris is all the more interesting. Yes, Paris will do him the world of good. Yes, it'll be an education. Good for him. Can I cash these two in? Just a minute. Too late to back out now. How much did I lose? Counting yesterday and the day before, 1.5 million yen. You'll need more than that, they're only worth 50,000. Really? I had to dig through all that junk to find them. You've got to help me. I can't go back with less than half, I'd lose all credibility. You have credibility? Take that box there. That one there. The most valuable thing Grandfather gave me. It's an 8th century lacquer box, not that you'd know. It's easily worth 2 millions. This is worth that much? I don't get it. I'd better get going. Hey, Masa. Share a drink? I intended to, but I don't like funerals and such. Sorry about that. Grandpa, you miss me, do you? You're angry, you have a right to be. While you lay dying, I was out gambling. I didn't know, but that's no excuse. The thing is, Grandpa, I don't even like gambling. I can't explain it, but I can't stop myself from gambling. Please don't get angry with me. I was never happy having to work at your company. You're a hard act to follow. I suffered because of that. They kept transferring me around. You said that was good for me, but it wasn't. None of the executives wanted to be my boss. No-one wants the boss' grandson watching their every move. So they soon moved me out. I had the job titles, but none of the responsibilities. You knew me very well, but you didn't know that. I only started gambling to upset you. I hoped we might fight and it would come out. But you died without ever learning the truth. Now you're dead, we'll never have that argument. It was all a waste. Grandpa... What should I do now? Tell me, Grandpa. Say something, Grandpa. Here they come, all the ones you hated. Watch me upset them, Grandpa. #They all reckon I drink, I'm a drunk #But I only drink to make it all go away #All you who like a drink Put yourself in my place #Saying I have to give it up Only makes me drink more Bring another round! #Farewell to Kentaro Munekata To all who have suffered because of Kentaro. It was not an easy road to travel. Now we celebrate his departure and our freedom. With a bevy of beautiful, dancing Geisha. Kentaro Munekata has safely returned from France. Here's the $5,000 you gave me as a parting gift. No way you'll get it back! What if they hadn't let you off the boat? I'd swim back. What's wrong with Paris? What a waste. I'd do anything for the chance to go to Paris. Montmartre, The Avenue des Champs-Élysées... Why did you sneak back? Sneak back? You've got it wrong. Then say it. I want to hear why. If it isn't Kimura. Up to 3 months ago, I worked in your Contracts Dept. Join us for a drink. Are you angry about something? Don't push me! What the hell? I got fired because they needed a scapegoat to cover your mistakes. It was my fault? The contract you made lost a fortune. You only did it to upset them. They couldn't fire you, so they fired me. I didn't know that, but I'll make sure they rehire you. You will? Don't make me laugh. You never take any responsibility. You couldn't even go to Paris, could you? You could only ever survive in Japan. In the glasshouse built by your grandfather. You're as useless as this tropical fish. Don't do that! That's you, out of Japan. That's why you snuck back to your glasshouse. You understand? Thank you. You've made it very clear. Mr. Munekata! #To Kentaro #I sold the box for 1.9 million, I made a great profit. #So I'm giving you back something I found in there. Last Testament? #To Kentaro From your Grandfather "Leave tiny Japan and see the wide world." Grandpa, thank you. Now I understand. I really will go. Really? Inform Beirut immediately. Good news everyone! Excuse me, Miss. Get me a beer. Cold beer. Excuse me. You must make your order in English. I only speak Japanese. I'm leaving tiny Japan to see the big wide world. Nothing. Where are you going? To Beirut, for now. For now? A sudden decision, that's all they had. Certainly, right away. I'm 2nd generation Japanese, I speak the language. You'll end up in trouble. #Hong Kong Airport Beer and snacks. That Japanese girl left at Hong Kong. Shall I translate? No, I'm no tropical fish. Tropical fish? Don't worry, Grandpa. I'll get by somehow. #Beirut Airport Mr. Kentaro Munekata! Over here! We came to get you! You exit through there. I've had enough of glasshouses. - Glass houses? - I'll go someplace else. That's not my business. You're right, goodbye then. I'm Japanese. Anywhere, next plane out. No point, I won't understand. All I want is the first plane out of here. Cairo? That's in Egypt, isn't it? Get off me. That's in Africa. Wow, that is something. Stop leaning on me. This is strange. Why is it filled with underwear? He swapped bags. Don't fall over. We meet again. This plane is going to Cairo. I know, but don't think I'm following you. I know, you're a tropical fish escaping the glasshouse. It's enormous. #Cairo It's more modern than I thought. #Cairo Airport Saheed is not on board. Something's gone wrong. They did it. So many flies. Miss Shiratori? Miss Yuriko Shiratori? I'm Nakagawa, I take care of Japanese tourists. Leave our guest alone! I know a good hotel. What's gone wrong? He switched bags. Switched bags? I just got a call from Beirut. Did you see a Japanese with the same bag? A Japanese guy? That's him. - Where is he? - The Japanese guy? Here on business? No. You're a tourist? No. Look, are you carrying any cash in your bag? I've got $5 grand here. Well, that's good. Lot of thieves around. Where does this road go? The Pyramids of Giza. I always take clients there first. There are 80 pyramids in total. This one has 2,300,000 2m cube blocks. 100,000 laborers, 3,000 masons worked for 20 years. These stones would surround France in a 1 meter wall. Great, isn't it? 5,000 years old. I reckon it looks like a coal stack in Kyushu. A coal stack? - It's hot, remove your jacket. - I'm fine. You're the champion pyramid climber. Yes, up and back in 7 minutes. Seven minutes, too long. What's so funny? My friend can do it in 3. Three minutes? Sure. See, he's getting ready now. I'm racing a Japanese guy, go get a crowd. What? He wants to race you up the pyramid. Climb it? No way! This is how they welcome you to Egypt. No way I want to climb a pyramid. "Never run from a challenge." Okay, then. I'm a police officer. To make it fair, I'll be the judge. This cop is the judge. Get going! I'll do it, Grandpa. One move and you're dead. Walk to our car. Hey, come back! Don't worry, I'll get your bag. Hey, wait! This man is my friend. My jacket. Officer! I'm from headquarters. Take this man to his hotel. #Japanese Embassy Mr. Fujita. Her parents disappeared here during the war. Is that right? When war broke out, they sent me back to Japan. The British interned them. Father was a doctor. But they forced him into spying. A spy, I see. The British destroyed all intelligence records after the war. I'm afraid we can't help. Is that so? I studied Arabic to help search for them. Thank you so much. I heard something recently that may help you. An Asian who worked for the British during the war. Now he works at the Mena nightclub. At a nightclub? How do I find it? You're a smuggler, your bag's full of jewels. Yes, that's right. Get up and dance. You wish to speak to me, Miss? Sorry, there's been a mistake. So you are looking for a Japanese person? Yes, do you know anyone? Not me. But maybe Mr. Nakagawa can help you. Mr. Nakagawa? Here's the $500 I owe you, now we're clear. Say thank you. I added $100 in interest. Just go away, will you? Stealing from your own countryman. You're the worst. You're a loan-shark. You should talk. I don't do it for myself. Don't tell me you're doing this for others? I do it to set my people free. Your people? What a joke. He may come here, so deal with it. Okay? I told you not to come here. What if the Imperialists saw you? Has something gone wrong? Saheed was stabbed in Beirut and the bag was stolen from him. Saheed? Is he dead? Stolen? What about the papers and the pendant? Stolen, too. That's strange. Lost your tropical fish? - Oh, hello. - Good evening. - My wallet's gone. - Really? That dancer. A woman? Kick him out. We're kicking out the man who owns this. Here's your bag, sir. You can't do anything without evidence. Let's go. I'm sorry. "Never let anyone steal from you." Right again, Grandpa. What's that? I've changed my mind. It was Laila. Find out her room number. Now the bag is stolen, what about our independence? What will happen to our people, our homeland? The pendant is more important, it holds the secret. Yes, the microfilm. Who are you? My wallet. You thief, stealing my money. Give it back and I won't say anything. What? I want my money back. Get your hands off me. Get out of here! Open this door. What's all this? Grandpa, what's going on? They stole my money, my bag. I've had enough of this. Open up. Open this door. Give me my money! How about "Open the door." Open up now. Open the door. I'll break it down. People will hear him. I'll get rid of him. Get off me. Who are you? It wasn't me. I'd never stab anyone. I'll get Yuriko. His wallet was stolen. Yuriko, big trouble. That's him. Hello, Inspector. What's wrong now? - A murder. - Murder? Come with me. Over there. That's strange. What happened here? What is he saying? I bent down to pick up a pendant. He had a knife in him, he fell down. It's true. Oh, I see. You don't believe me. I know. Look at this. That's strange. There was blood here. Is he a little crazy? It's true. Laila took him while I went to get you. - Yes, of course. - That's enough, I understand. They took him inside. Stand back and I'll prove it. Out of the way. Watch. It was him. He was stabbed in the chest. You're supposed to be dead. You saw him. I left him with you. What are you talking about? Anyway, let's go. Yes, but still... Sorry for bothering you. It's okay. We'll leave now. Apparently, he's crazy. Okay, it wasn't murder but my bag was strange. Look, I'll show you. Sorry about that. Not at all. That's strange. This is weird. It really was murder. Fahid, if you die now, what happens to our revolution? What of our independence? Laila, this is no time to cry. The dawn of our freedom is approaching. All must strive to win our independence. By all means get the pendant back. Laila, I'll rely on you. Laila, you're on. Poor man, the Egyptian sun has got to his brain. It can do that. So do as she tells you. Next time, you won't get off so easily. Thank you for everything. Did you say I was crazy? You understood that? But what else could I say? Then how do you explain this pendant? It's beautiful. You can wear it as a souvenir. I'll do that. And I'll find out its secret. Grandpa's 2nd dictum. "Never run from a challenge." That's her voice. Damn her. How can such a beautiful voice be so evil? I don't get it, Grandpa. #The desert under moonlight #Seems to stretch on forever #Their journey, astride camels #Beneath the moon #One of gold, one of silver #The saddles that they ride #Side by side, they bob and weave #Beneath the moon #On the saddle made of gold #Sits a jar of silver #On the saddle made of silver #Sits a jar of gold #Both these precious jars #Ride together, side by side #Secured to the saddles with fine rope #One saddle has... Don't stop, you're good. Keep going, don't be shy. I'm not shy, just distracted. Wet hair looks so sexy. Keep that up and you're out. Yes, Ma'am. Behave yourself or I'll kick you out. I'm sorry. #Nationalist Safe House - Leave him to me. - No! We must get the pendant before Luxor, or the revolution is lost. I know that. I'll get it back even if I have to kill that Japanese man. For the honor of our cause. I swear by this dagger that killed Fahid. #Imperialist Headquarters You fools! If you can't get a pendant, how will you stop the revolution? The microfilm is hidden in the pendant. If the Nationalists get that information, they will succeed! We must stop them from doing that. Or our Great Leader will be deposed. At ease. The day of their revolt is fast approaching. Get the pendant, kill them all. Paris, eh? But why do so many Japanese girls want to be designers? Why do they all want to go to Paris? But if I find my father, I will go back to Japan. I'll open a dressmaker's shop and live happily with him. But if he's still alive, isn't it stranger? Why hasn't he contacted your? It's been 16 years. If mother is still alive, they may have opened a hospital for the poor. If that's so, I'll throw it all away and join them. Yes, they said Mother died in an air-raid... But she may still be alive. If that's the case... All I talk about is "ifs." If, if, if only... Why did you really come here, Kentaro? Kentaro? "Even if she loves you, do not return her love." You're safe! Who'd fall in love with you? Always exercising. Soon I can return to Japan. That's wonderful. The archeologists will fit you in? I have money. I'm just waiting to hear from them. It's been 2 years. Now I have the money to bribe the pilot. Back in Japan, I can make a new life. You must miss Japan. Yes, of course I do. I love Egypt the most. Because it's your homeland. That's right. Hello Nakagawa. Oh, it's you? Please tell me which hotel Yuriko is staying at. Looking for Yuriko? Tell me why? Nakagawa lives around here? He may know about my father. Look, that's her. She won't get away this time. I got you! What's happening? Look, over there. Get a motorboat, but watch out for the police. Why bring me here? Don't play innocent, I want my $5,000 back. Where is it? Tell me. Those eyes won't charm me this time, give me my wallet. Stop it, don't. I said stop it, now. What's this? Is that my $5,000? Now it's my turn. It's very hard to get to. Isn't there some way I can get it out? Stop moving around. God, forgive me as I kill for my country. Stop babbling, just give me my money. God, give me the strength to do this. What now? What happened? Escape with the pendant, take this with you. That's my wallet. Nakagawa stole it, I'm returning it. But there's only $500 left. I can't help that, Nakagawa stole it, not me. Nakagawa? He took it, did he? Run with the pendant now! I don't understand. Oh, I don't know what to do. But if he stole it, how come you had it? If they get the pendant, all is lost. Don't scare me with that. It's him, get the launch! What's up now? What's going on? Is Mr. Nakagawa home? No, he's out. Where did he go? No idea. When will he be back? No idea, come back tomorrow. Why is this bag here? And what about this $5,000? As I said, this is not... Shut up! These documents are meant to throw us off the track. This is all Kentaro's idea, isn't it? No, he's just a tourist... Shut up! We have evidence he's behind it. A young foreigner will lead the revolution. Is Kentaro that leader? Don't be stupid, it's not him. Are you a doctor? Yes, I happened by in time to help the young girl. Do you know any Japanese doctors? A Japanese doctor? Yes, Dr. Shiratori, he'll be about your age. I'm sorry, no. There's an emergency, I must go. Are you telling the truth? Yes, Kentaro is a nationalist, he's leading the revolution. That's what you want, you fools. Now we know why Kentaro had the bag and the pendant. Yes, why? What will we do with Kentaro? #Cairo Central Police HQ Okay, I'll shut up. I don't understand. Why let me go and not her? You're not being fair. We need that pendant to win our independence. Please take it to my comrades. You want it? Okay, here. I don't understand. Be careful, guard that pendant with your life! #Cairo Museum #The Citadel #City of the Dead #Hussein Central Bazaar #First Opera House to Perform Aida #Solomon Pasha Road Hurry up, get in. You stole my money! You're in danger, get in. Where are we going? Police, let me use your phone. Yes, Detective Harid? What? He got into an unidentified vehicle? I'll send help. Put phase 2 into action. I was right. Kentaro is their leader, just as I suspected. Good work, we'll do everything we can to support you. Who beat you up, you thief? Well... Who's this guy? My friend. #Saqqara Desert What's going on? A puncture, get out. Hey wait, come back! Fooled again. If a plane comes, this is an American movie. Am I hearing things? I don't believe it. Hey, come and rescue me... He's shooting at me. "Never run away from a fight." That's impossible now, Grandpa. Stop scaring me. Damn it. What's with you? What are you doing here? I'm a designer, I'm here to study ancient art. But why are you here? A plane tried to kill me. Have you been out in the sun again? Wait, you can hear the engine. What engine? That's strange. Kentaro was attacked by an airplane. Hey! Give us a ride to Cairo. He's escaping, what should we do? Follow him. We'll release Laila, them we can close the net. Please. I did exactly what you asked me. Look. See this? I've waited 2 years, I'll miss my plane. My orders are to wait until they contact me. But then I'll miss my plane. The express train takes 12 hours to get to Luxor airport. Please, I beg you. Enough! I don't know how you live in this sweatbox. Get me water. No one's answering. Go and see. Where's Kentaro? Move, I have to go. Tell me where he is. I'm out of time. Thank you. He lives near here. Are you okay, kid? Here. Here. I'll show him. Laila. Give me back the pendant. Where's Nakagawa? She wants the pendant. Oh, the pendant? What? Don't tell me you lost it. Have you lost it? I just had it. What did you do with the pendant? I had it in the truck. Sorry, looks like I did lose it. You fool! What happens to our revolution now? To you, it's nothing. To us, it's worth more than life itself. They're all waiting for it at Luxor. Luxor? Yes, everyone's waiting there. Without the pendant, we can never win our independence. You idiot! Take me to Cairo Station. She's lion of the independence movement, they need that pendant. I know. Strangely, I understand what she says. But what have I done? That's the pendant. Come back. I've got you! You're looking for Mr. Shiratori, the Japanese doctor. Do you know something? Yes, I do. It's not good news. It appears that Dr. Shiratori died, about two years ago. He's dead? That can't be... I don't believe it. He's buried in a grave at Luxor. In Luxor? Yes, there's a Japanese grave near Queen Hatshepsut's Palace. This is a map to it. How do you know about this grave? A friend of mine knew your father. I'm very sorry. Get up! You idiot. What's going on here? Let's arrest him and take him in. Yuriko, I got it. I'll go find Laila at Cairo Station. I'll go with you. My father's buried in Luxor. Your father? So he's dead? Thank you. Farewell. Let me go. What have I done? Shut up, it's me. You're just making trouble. I'm sorry, he took the pendant off me. Where's the radio? Nakagawa's place. Good, go to the station, we must stop Kentaro. We will be there, too. #Cairo Railway Station Laila is waiting at the entrance. Laila? Waiting for me, is she? What will you do? Well... Sorry, but I'll take this train. Once you see your father's grave, give up your search. Yes, I will. Goodbye. Let's go. Kentaro, listen very closely. Don't look at me, just keep walking. Who are you? These men are Imperialists, they're Laila's enemies. They're going to kidnap you. What can I do? Follow my lead and escape. I'll go on ahead. Dr. Shiratori. It's Dr. Shiratori, isn't it? I'm not Shiratori, I'm not Yuriko's father. Then who are you? Yuriko's father, Yusaku Shiratori... died 18 years ago at the outbreak of World War II. These days, I'm just another old Egyptian. But why? I've built my grave at Luxor, one for me and my wife. That's where I buried my Japanese identity. Yuriko's father sleeps in that grave. I spied for the British, many Japanese suffered for that. But they forced you, it was war. I chose spying over death. I can never forgive my own cowardice. Yuriko abandoned everything to take you back to Tokyo. That would make neither of us happy. Like this old car, at least I can be of some use here. I can at least atone for some of my sins... in the land where my wife is buried. Can you understand what I'm telling you? Feel for an old man who told his daughter where he's buried. Don't tell her, urge her to go to Paris. Please. #Luxor Station Let go of me! Not you again! Let me go, I'll miss my plane. #The Colossus of Memnon #Queen Hatshepsut's Palace #The Tomb of Deir el-Medina I'll go ask those men. Which way? The rebels are all gathered at Hatshepsut's Palace. It's on the way to my grave. Let's go now. Just a moment. The Imperialists drove past here a little while ago. Where's Laila got to? What has happened to her? We need the pendant. We're so close to winning. That's it. That's my plane. Damn it. #Yusaku & Yoshiko Shiratori I forgot the rest. Kentaro, be careful! Stop, or I shoot. Let's go. Let's go save him. #The divine Karnak #Temple of the Hub Here's the pendant. Thank you Kentaro, you've saved the revolution. Bring the pendant before I count to ten. One! Two! Three! Four! Laila, take the pendant and run to our homeland! Five! Our lives we gladly sacrifice. Six! Never give up the pendant! Seven! Eight! Nine! No, don't do it. Don't kill them. Wait. Don't shoot them. Wait. Stay where you are. This is the Egyptian police. You are surrounded, there's no way out. You are all under arrest for sedition. Throw down your weapons and surrender now. You are all free. Why not arrest them, too? I don't speak English. Liar. I just heard you speak in English. Come on, hurry on back to your own country. Get on the truck. That pendant won't suit you at all. Won't suit me? It's not your style. Whose style is it? Laila, give it to her. You give it to her. Thank you. Kentaro, how can we ever thank you? Thank you is plenty. You've shown me a big, new world. Stop dawdling, get on the truck. Kentaro? Use it for your independence. You're a wonderful fellow. Me neither! Farewell! Good luck! Hello, Mr. Nakagawa. Won't you come back to Japan with us? No, I've fallen in love with Egypt. You can be our agent here. You watch me, I'll sell everything your company sends me. Go to Paris and forget about your father. I will. There's much I have to learn there. I'll be safe on my own. Just a moment. Look, they have won their independence. "A new land is born." Laila must be happy. "When the world seems small return to big Japan." Right again, Grandpa. Excuse me, Miss. Cold beer, please. Grandpa, help me. #We, the big-hearted #With the big smiles on our faces #Even the pyramids look small to us #The vast blue sky above me Like a vast sombrero #This vast world of ours Is my homeland The End Subtitles by Stuart J Walton (Sprout)
