(birds chirping) (buffalo sniffing) (gun firing) (hooves thudding) (gun clicking) - Listen, boy, if you touch my gun again I'll have your fuckin' head mounted. - You shouldn't have shot that. It was too far. Now we've got a wounded buffalo out there. - I don't want anybody telling me it's too far. - Hey, all right, what the hell's going on. - Where's Taylor, I want to speak with him. - He's back at camp. - When I paid for my guided safari, it wasn't for the B-team. It said, "Escorted by a white hunter." I've just about had it up to here being told what I can and what I can't shoot by some chicken-shit negro. Get Taylor. - He's not available. And he doesn't like people who use animals for target practice and he's had it up to here with killing. - Great, I'm on a fucking safari. My great white hunter, your boss, loses his appetite for killing animals. I don't suppose he's lost his appetite for taking my money, has he? I'm going in there after that buffalo myself, alone. - No you're not, pal. You go in there and there's an accident, the government's gonna use it to try and ban hunting entirely. - That should suit you, you're just as yellow bellied as Taylor is. - All right, Roger, you go with him. - Yeah, you come with me. And you can take a picture with me and the buffalo. - Hold it! (buffalo moaning) - Run! (buffalo snorting) (hooves thundering) (Roger yells) (buffalo snorting) (gun firing) (man groaning) (hooves thudding) (birds chirping) - Buffalo killed him, yeah. Buffalo killed him! (quiet somber music) (upbeat music) (buffalo moaning) (plane engine roaring) (people chattering) - There she is. Keep the lights off her til I near her, let's take her by surprise. Miss Hill, what is your position on government plans to loosen restrictions on game hunting in Sekomo. - What? - Television, as you said, is to test the killing of African wildlife. - I don't know if I said that. And I suppose so, yes. - So you are against the government's plan? - I'm against the killing of African wildlife. The rhinoceros is almost killed off as it is. Doing that with a license from the government doesn't make it any different from what this terrible, Singh, Roger Singh, that should tell you something about people who kill animals. - [Journalist] You mean the Singh who was in for manslaughter? - Before that he had a conviction for poaching. I know for a fact that he was responsible for killing off the rhinoceros in this country. He's just a killer either way. - Bitch! - [Journalist] But he did his time, shouldn't he given another chance? - Goddam loudmouth, bitch, what right has she got to talk about me on television like that! - As reported earlier, Roger Singh is the ex-poacher released yesterday after serving four years for manslaughter. We'll be back with more news as soon-- (dramatic music) - Roger? (bright music) (birds clucking) - [Man] Taxi! - Elephant, very cheap. - No. - Good elephante, want to buy. - No. - Miss Micah Hill? - Yeah. - Am I glad to see you, I'm Watson. - Oh. - I'm to drive you to Mr. Taylor's place. - Oh, thank God, thank you. (people chattering) (horns honking) - Miss Hill, excuse me. I'm John Sterling, sorry I'm a bit late. I got held up in traffic. Hi, Watson, how you doin'? - Very well. - Well, welcome to Sekomo. I've come for the painting. I can tell you, everyone's looking forward to your presentation. Especially the president. I think they've sold some 200 tickets already. It seems that everyone in the capital wants to meet the famous Micah Hill. - That's great, I hope the president likes my painting. - Oh, I'm sure he will. Can we have a look? Wonderful, it's exactly what we need. Look at that, Watson. - We all think it's a great idea of Ian's. I hope it influences the government to help wildlife. - Oh, I'm sure it will. I'm certain it will. Well, Watson's taking you out to the camp, is he? - That's right. - Oh, good, in that case, I'll see you at the reception. Nice to meet you and thank you. See you, Watson. - Am I glad you're on time. - (laughs) Bye. - It's all right, it's okay. It's in good hands. (gentle music) (phone clicking) Ian, yeah. They're leaving now. (engine puttering) (dramatic music) (upbeat music) (people chattering) - Get out of the bloody way. (dramatic music) - More than five minutes I've been waiting. - Well, I was relieved to see you. - [Watson] How was your flight? - Horrific, are you complaining about coming over to it. - What was that, did we just? - Bloody hell, did you see that? Did you see that? Sh, bloody. (dramatic music) (chickens clucking) (people chattering) No more, leave now. (dramatic music) (people chattering) Who are these people? - They're my parents. They want you to marry me too. - You think I want to marry you? I don't want to marry you. Do you really think that I want to grow old like that in this shit hole of a place? Get out you bitch, go on, get out! Bitch. (somber music) - Someone called you. I left a message by the telephone. You see, Roger, you do need me. - I'll show you how much I need you. Just watch. (phone whirring) Hi, Amanda, it's the old Roger, (laughs) just got out. Why don't you come down tonight, eh? And bring that friend of yours, will ya. Yeah, right, see you later. (dramatic music) Damn conservationist bitch. (gentle music) (elephant moaning) (elephant trumpeting) (upbeat music) (wildlife grunting) (monkeys chattering) (engine puttering) - [Watson] We've arrived. - (speaking in foreign language) No, it's okay. Bye. - [Watson] Goodbye. Enjoy yourself. - Micah! - Jane! - Oh, I was so glad to get your letter that you were coming a few days early before the reception. How are you? So good to see you. - Great to see you. - How are you and Ian doing? - Oh, Ian's so busy these days with his anti-poaching and his African wildlife groups. You know, he has a meeting with the president at least once a week. That leaves me to run the safari camp all by myself. Thank goodness it's off season now. Come on, I'll show you to your tent. - I brought you something. - Have you? What is it? (Micah laughing) Can I guess, is it a surprise. - [Micah] Hello. - Oh, I don't think you've met Zoko. - No, last time I was here there was a leopard. - Oh, yes, I remember. It was in here when you came to bed. - [Micah] That's right. - [Jane] Is this the surprise? - [Micah] Yep. - Thank you, Micah, how lovely. Ah, that's beautiful. In your last letter you said you were working on a book. You also said that you've broken up your engagement. - Yeah, well, that's ancient history now. - Oh dear. Well, maybe you'd like some coffee, hm? Let's go and find Steven. (gentle music) (monkey chattering) Thanks, Steven. - [Micah] Where is Ian anyway. - [Jane] No, I think he's wandering around in the bush somewhere. I worry about him, you know. He refuses to carry a gun anymore. - [Micah] Maybe that's not a bad thing. - [Jane] It's a bit risky, I think. (gentle music) I told you she was coming early. - What? - [Jane] I told you she was coming early. - Did ya? - Yeah. - Well, my God, look at her. She's beautiful. (laughs) Welcome home, it's been too long. - [Micah] Thanks, it's great to see you. - And a television star to boot. - Was it on already. - It certainly was. Well, you're famous now, aren't you. People want to know what you have to say. - [Jane] What was it, dear? - Oh, just some TV reporter making damn fool questions. Micah said she was against poaching. - Well, that's good. If Micah says so, people will listen, won't they. - Yes, they will. - Well, I don't know why. They shouldn't really. I don't know much about it. Hey, you should have seen those elephants we saw on the way up here, millions of them. - That's odd. Well, how was your trip? You must need a drink, wash all that dust down, come on. (somber music) Damn government, what do they care, tucked away in their big offices and their big houses. They way they enforce the laws against poaching, it might just as well be legal. Even talk of loosening the hunting laws now, just to make it easier for them to ignore the whole problem. It's the poor animals that suffer, those and the few of us who still care about them. - Ian, you will upset Micah. I'm afraid he's on his soapbox again. - Well, someone's got to cope with this madness. Bastards! You know what these poachers do, Micah? They go into the animal parks, wildlife preserves and they slaughter the elephants, poor, defenseless elephants. They hack off their tusks, leave the carcasses to rot. Don't even use the meat with thousands starving here. Nobody cares, nobody does anything. I shouldn't be bothering you with all this, should I? You don't want to hear it, do you. - There's somebody coming. (engine puttering) (crickets chirping) - [Ian And Jane] Mark! - Hello, Jane. - Hello. - Ian. - What are you doing here? - This is Micah Hill, Mark Smith. You heard us talk about Micah. She's here to present her painting at the reception on Friday. - I know, I saw it in the newspaper. It's nice to meet you. - I suppose you also read about Roger Singh. - Yeah, why they let that son of a bitch out, I'll never know. - You should have seen Micah on the television. She called him killer. - What, is she crazy? - Oh, Mark. - Hang on, exactly what did you say about Roger Singh? - I don't know, I said it was in the papers about him being a poacher. I said I was against poaching, that's all. - You know, if Roger's heard any of this, he's gonna have a wild hair up his ass. - Yes, yes, have a brandy. You're not working, are you? - Yeah. I'm on my way up country. There's signs of elephants everywhere and I gotta keep 'em from heading into that farming district. If you don't mind, I thought I'd bunk here tonight, get an early start. - Oh, please do. You know, it was Mark who was responsible for Roger Singh's conviction. The funny thing is, Roger always claimed that Mark was the murderer. - Well, what do you expect him to say? It was his word against mine and I guarantee you if it hadn't been for that poaching conviction of his the year before, they'd probably just as soon believed him as me. - I was right. Poachers and murderers. - I just think you should be careful what you say. To a man like Roger Singh, you never know what he'll do. - I doubt if Roger Singh's ever read a newspaper in his life. You'll be all right, don't worry. We won't let anything happen to ya. - Ian, I need your help. How would you feel about going to Sekomo tomorrow? - Sekomo, I just got back. - Just try and send up a plane or two. I gotta get those elephants headed back into the parks and the president will listen to you. - All right, someone will have to look after Micah. She'll have to go with you. - Ian, I think I'd rather stay here and sketch. - Please, Jane's busy tomorrow. It'll be an adventure for you. - You'll see a lot more animals if you go. - All right. - All right, it's a deal. (laughs) Might give her some facts for her talk shows. I'll see you here at 5:00 a.m., okay. - I think I'll go to bed now. Would it be possible to take a bath? - Yes, of course, come on. - Goodnight. - [Jane] Goodnight. - You'll get along just fine, you'll see. - Get out of my bloody way! (dramatic music) (tense music) (Roger screams) (mystical music) Jesus, you brute. (snake hissing) Get out of here, you little monster. Go on, back it off now, hey! Thank you, you miserable sod. (gentle music) (monkey chattering) (Micah laughing) - Sorry! I didn't know anybody, I didn't know anybody was here! - All right, so let's go out and have a drink, eh. - I love free drinks. - Ah, nice. - Let's do it again. (all laughing) - Let's all go have a drink and then do it again, yeah. Pass me the matches, will ya. - There you are. - Thanks. - How you feel now? (Roger moans) Good. - Oh, you've got a message here. - Here, read it to me. - Elephants ruining crops, needed taken care of. They're yours-- - [Both] Fred Johnson. - What is it? - See ya girls, I gotta go. - Go? - I knew it. - I'm sorry. It's business, girl. All right, girls, you let yourselves out, eh. - Oh Roger, I'm going to miss you. - Mm, oh. - Take care. - Mm, oh. Oh God, if it wasn't elephants it would have to be you, eh. (all laughing) Hey now, listen, when I come back, money, lots of dresses for you. A dozen dresses each! - Wow. - And we party, hey! (all laughing) - All right, Roger. - Hey, hey, now don't go out with any rubbish til I come back (laughing). (lion roaring) (dramatic music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) - Micah! (horn honking) (upbeat music) (engine revving) - Did they go already? - Right on time. I must be off too. - I'll come with you if you like. - No, no, no, I'll be back. - Take care. - Sorry about last night. (bright music) (upbeat music) (dramatic music) (engine puttering) (birds cawing) - What are you gonna do with those elephants when you find them? - I'll try to herd them back into the parks. If that doesn't work, they'll have to be shot. - Easy way out, huh? I suppose it's your job to do it. - Yeah, unfortunately it is. - When I was a kid growing up on the farm, I watched my grandfather put a raccoon into a burlap bag and smash it up against the wall. It was destroying the crops. I just don't believe that's the only solution. - Give me a break. - What? - Nothing, nothing. (upbeat music) (birds chirping) (engines puttering) (horn honking) Shit! (Micah screaming) You okay? (gasping) Goddammit. The elephants are destroying themselves. - Elephants, what about that track of wood? And look at your arm. - Shit. Hand me that kit by your foot. - Here, let me help. (gentle music) (birds chirping) - Thanks. Shit. Looks like the elephants moved on through the village. I gotta check it out. (engine revving) (birds chirping) (upbeat music) (people chattering) (baby crying) (sticks thudding) (people chattering) (dogs barking) (all speaking in foreign language) (men speaking in foreign language) - Micah! - I couldn't wait any longer. - These damn people, you'd think they were my elephants. I can't control the goddam things. - Maybe you could put something around the crops that the elephants don't like. - Oh, yeah, like what. - Like an orbiting missile station with elephant seeking warheads. - You really think what happened to those people is funny? Fine, now maybe people laugh at different things where you live. Where is that now, New York? That's why I left. - I'm sorry. (engine revving) (gentle upbeat music) (birds calling) (gentle music) - All right, we'll take a break here and eat some lunch. (birds chirping) - Oh my God! (elephant roaring) (gentle music) - There's hundreds of 'em. And they're moving right to Fred Johnson's farm. - I've never seen anything like it. - I'm glad you got a chance too. It's not gonna last. Come on, let's eat. (upbeat music) (elephants moaning) Now Johnson's got the legal right to shoot any of those elephants that trespass. I just wish I knew why they were leaving the parks. Used to be the heavy poaching. I don't know. Maybe it's a drought. (birds chirping) (dramatic music) Shit! Stay here! Where you goin' Roger? - What the hell business is it of yours, just 'cause you're the big game warden now, doesn't mean to say you can stop people going about their ordinary business. Get out of my way. - I heard you were out. What was it, government connections? If you're thinking about those elephants, Roger, you just turn around and head back right here and now. - Nobody tells me what to do, man. - Well, I'm telling you, man. (gun clicking) Move out. - I don't suppose you'd care to put that rifle down and argue about it. - Move, Roger! (dramatic music) (engine revving) (somber music) - What's going on? - Nothing, nothing to be concerned about. Look, we better head out. - Have you had enough lunch? - I'm not really hungry, I'll eat later. - You sure you're all right? - Yeah, come on. (gentle music) (elephants trumpeting) (car rattling) - [Roger] Fred! Hey, Fred! (dog barking) (laughs) How you doin' Fred? - Roger, bloody, Singh. I'd heard they let you fly. Should have known you'd come looking around here. Jail never changed anybody for the good. - Ain't lookin' around, Fred. I came because you called. - What? - The elephants, you called me. - I didn't call. - Oh, come on, Fred. I've been driving all night. I've even had a poacher, now you're telling me you didn't call me? - That's right, I didn't call ya. - Aw, come on! - I dunno, now you're here, come here. - (laughs) Hey, Fred, you're a wonder you are. It's a great place you've here, you know. - [Fred] If I don't make some money quickly, I'm gonna lose it. - [Roger] Oh, don't worry, I've got a proposition to put to you. - Here, sit down. You know, you didn't come to see me. What are you after? - I told ya, elephants, ivory. - What's in it for me? - You get to keep my crops, Fred. - Look, I can clear them out myself. - (laughs) But you can't get rid of the ivory, I've got the contacts. Cross the border, down the coast, the stock will be in India by the end of the month. And your share will be paid in dollars, anywhere you want in the world, within three months. - What do you think it would be worth, my share? - 200 head of elephants, at say, only 40 pounds a head. Then your share must be worth, 25, $30,000. That's not bad for a night's work, Fred. - How you gonna kill 200 elephants in one night. - (laughs) My boys have killed over 200 elephants in an hour. - 25 to 30 you say. Yeah, but it's risky. If you get caught, I go to jail and lose everything. Mind you, these things are, the bank's gonna take it. Let me think about it, Roger, let me think about it. You want some coffee? - I'll have a beer. (groans) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (dramatic music) (engine puttering) - Game ranger, that's all I bloody need. Hello, Mark. - Hello, Fred. - [Fred] I thought you'd be coming along. Hey, Roger's in there. Big surprise, I didn't even know he was out yet. - Yeah, I thought as much, Fred. - Hello. - Hi, I'm Micah Hill. - Yeah, I know. I seen ya in the newspapers. Please, come in, come in. (birds chirping) Hey, Roger, I'd like you to meet Micah Hill. This is Roger Singh. - What the hell are you doin' here, Roger? I thought I told you to stay clear of these elephants. - [Roger] I'm not doing anything. I am visiting an old friend. - Never learn, will ya. You're getting yourself in trouble already. - Look, I'm two days out of jail and you're already on my case, following me around, eh? Trying to make a mess of my life. You and your girlfriend here. I should have know, hey, what a pair. - I'm not following you, Roger. I just came from the village east of here. It was torn up pretty bad. So I figured some of the elephants must of ended up here. - [Roger] You're a lying son of a bitch. You called me last night, didn't you? Left a message to tell me to come down here. - I don't know what you're talkin' about. - You're a sneaky bastard, just like you always were. Only this time your little setup didn't work. You left me that phony message. - Nobody set you up, Roger. Nobody but yourself. - You killed that guy four years ago, and you know it! You better take care, Miss Hill, your boyfriend here's a murderer. - That's bullshit. - Your boyfriend and I were partners once in a hunting firm with Ian Taylor. And one day something went wrong. One of our rich American clients got killed. And I was the fall guy. - And what about the money that was missing? - I never denied taking that money. But that guy was dead with your bullet in his guts. You screwed me, man, you really screwed me. Why did you do that, man? And now you've come down here, trying to set me up again and bring your girlfriend down to talk about me on the television set. - That's a lie, Roger, it's a crock of shit and you know it. - Don't believe him now, Fred. Get out of my way, please. Get out of my way. - You got a permit for that rifle, Roger? - What? - That rifle out in your truck. After where you've been it's not likely. You got a permit or not? - Oh, come on, man, for God's sake. - Well, it's a good thing I came by. You're coming with me, Roger. I'm placing you under arrest for unlawful possession of a firearm. And you can bet your ass, you're going back to prison. (blow thuds) (dramatic music) (blows thudding) (men groaning) - [Micah] Do something! (blows thudding) (men groaning) (dramatic music) - Get out. - Give me that gun. - You stay where you are. I won't have you boys fighting on my property. You want to kill each other> Go do it somewhere else. All right, Roger, out. Go on, out. - You've messed around enough in my life. And you, you bitch. - Are you okay? - Your arm's bleeding again. - Oh, shit. - Yeah, Roger's crazy, always was. I didn't send for him. - Yeah, sure, Fred. Look, thanks a lot for your help. - It's best not to make an enemy of a man like that. Now get those elephants off my land or I will, my way. - I'll take care of it, Fred. And next time you see anymore on your land, you call us, not Roger Singh. - I tell ya, I didn't call him! - Yeah, then who did. - Roger thinks you did. (bright music) - (scoffs) I gotta make a call. Can I use a phone? - Yeah. - Is this Roger really as dangerous as he seems? - Hm, oh, don't worry about it. He just wants those elephants. Mark-o better keep clear though. - Are you really gonna kill those elephants? - Well, I can't have them destroying my property. - Couldn't you put up electric fences? - On 25,000 acres? I'm no millionaire, you know. (phone ringing) - Yeah. - Hello, John, is that you? - [John] Mark, where are you? - Oh, I'm out at Fred Johnson's, elephants are moving onto his farm. Look, let me talk to Ian. - Mark, Ian isn't here. I haven't spoken to him in weeks. - What do you mean, you haven't spoken to him? He should have been there by now? - [John] I really don't know where he is. - Oh shit, he was supposed to be there this morning to talk to you about this goddam elephant problem. (sighs) All right, John, look. If you can, wait for him. And if he doesn't show, will you do me a favor and drive up here? - [John] Sure, Mark, anytime you say. - By the way, Roger Singh's on the prowl again. I gotta try and figure out a way to stop him. (phone thuds) (birds chirping) Jesus Christ. We gotta go. - Mark, you know, I gotta warn ya. Roger thinks you set him up. You got him to come out here then just happened to turn up yourself, asking about gun permits. You two are bad news for each other, always have been. Something's gonna come of it before it's over. Someone's gonna get hurt. - Yeah, well thanks a lot for your concern, Fred. But I can take care of myself. - Oh sure, sure you can. What about her? - (sighs) Look, just to be safe, you better not stay at Jane and Ian's, at least until we get Singh in custody. Well, we gotta assume he's gonna come after both of us now, especially after what you said about him in the newspaper. - Where will I stay then? - (sighs) You'd be safe at my place. It's all right, Singh doesn't know where I live. Come on, let's go. (birds chirping) What's the matter, come on. Come on, I gotta get somebody up here to take care of these elephants and I got Roger Singh to worry about. (engine revving) (birds chirping) (engine puttering) (dramatic music) (engine puttering) (upbeat music) - Is there any truth in what he said? - [Mark] What? - [Micah] That you set him up, set Roger up? (lion roaring) (engine puttering) - Well, this is it. Got everything you need, right here. Well, it doesn't have much of a woman's touch, this place, but I found that women in this part of the world generally don't get along too well. (gentle music) All right, goddammit, I'm sorry. - What about? - About getting you involved in this. I should have known better than to take you along. - I can take care of myself. - I know that. I just don't think we should be enemies right now. - Mark, did you send Roger that message? - I told you, I didn't. (speaking in foreign language) My friend. - [Watson] Took your time coming back home. - (laughs) Yeah, between Watson and me, we keep things running pretty smooth around here. Can you help me with that box? - Yes. - Thanks. - Hello, good to see you again. - Nice to see you, too. - I didn't know you lived here. - This is home. (birds cawing) - How come he met me yesterday? - Who, Watson? - Yeah, he met me at the airport. - I don't know, must have been in town picking up supplies. Occasionally he helps Ian. - Do you live here all the time? - [Mark] Yeah, most of the year. - Are you sure we're gonna be safe here? - Look, you're gonna have to learn to trust me. You don't have another choice. Come on, I've seen Roger with that look he had today. He's always figuring some way to get what he wants. And right now, he wants revenge on me, maybe on you too. I'm afraid he's gonna try something. - I just wish I could call Jane and Ian. - What, on the shortwave? No, Roger knows the frequency. He could intercept the call and I don't want to give him any clues about where we are. Now don't worry. Jane and Ian know I'll take care of you. Now come on. I'll get the bed fixed up for you. Lie down if you want. - Where are you sleeping? - I'm sleeping on the couch. (laughs) Don't worry, I'm just trying to keep you safe and make you comfortable. (birds cawing) - [Watson] I've got enough food packed for you to last a week. - All right, you look after her. I may be gone most of the night. (gentle music) (engine puttering) (ostriches squawking) (engine puttering) (Mark groaning) (gentle music) (birds squawking) - This is big mistake you're making, Watson. - Mark taught me to be a checker player. And I taught him to be checker. Now he out-checks me. But I always win the checkers. (birds squawking) (Micah puffs) (crickets chirping) (owl hooting) (crickets chirping) (man grunts) - Hey, you must be slipping. - [Mark] For God's sake, Ian. - Time was you could tell my footsteps from anybody's. - Well, I almost blasted ya. - I was gonna drop off at the house to see how your day went with Micah, then I saw you driving away. - Oh, great, I was trying to be inconspicuous. - Where is Micah anyway? - She's down at the house with Watson. - [Ian] Why, what's happened? - [Mark] Singh. - Singh? - Yeah, we had a run-in today. I got a feeling he's gonna try something. - Huh, well, not to worry. I kept going, hid the Land Rover next to yours. I knew you'd take the upper ground, like I taught you. - I imagine you like that young lady, eh? - Shit. I liked livin', her I could do without. - Yes, I like her too. Do you mind if I keep watch with you. If anything happened to Micah, I'd never forgive myself. Nor would Jane. - No, I could use the company. (groans) Hey, did you ever make it to Sekomo, I called John, he said he hadn't heard from ya. - I was with the president, you oaf. - All right, so when's the plane come in? - Tomorrow. (crickets chirping) You must be tired. Why don't you close your eyes for a minute, I'm here. Give us your rifle. - No, I can't Ian, I've gotta stay awake. - Just rest for a moment. I'll wake you up, come on. - All right, just, I'm gonna close my eyes for a minute. - That's the way. (crickets chirping) Come on, Roger Singh, I know you're there. Come on. Make your move. (dramatic music) (intense music) (wildlife calling) (grass rustling) (monkeys chirping) (gate creaking) (animal screeching) (crickets chirping) (dramatic music) (animal hooting) (dramatic music) (owl hooting) (intense music) (dramatic music) (birds squawking) (crickets chirping) (dramatic music) (flesh squelches) (Watson groans) (body thuds) (crickets chirping) (door creaking) - Mark? (footsteps crunching) (dramatic music) Mark? (Micah puffs) (door creaking) (birds cawing) (door creaking) (toothpaste squelching) (intense music) (Micah screaming) - Where's your boyfriend? Ah, what does it matter? I've got the bait. Now, you scream, I'll cut your throat. (dramatic music) (birds cawing) (Micah groans) (owl hooting) (animals screeching) (Micah gasping) (blow thudding) (grass rustling) (birds cawing) - Everything all right? - How long you been asleep? - Asleep, I wasn't asleep, just closed my eyes for a second. - Yeah, a second, huh? - Gracious, I'm sure that's all it was. Hasn't been a soul near the house all night. - Yeah, well, I'm going down there. - I'll come with you. (owl hooting) (crickets chirping) (dramatic music) - You son of a bitch! Singh was here in my house, while you had your eyes closed for a second. - [Ian] And where were you? - I could have stayed awake. - But you didn't. - What the hell's the matter with you, Ian? Singh has got Micah, and I just hope to God she's still alive. - Then you'll just have to go out there and get them, won't you? Look at it this way, Mark. This isn't just an ordinary kidnapping, Micah's famous. - What are you talking about? - Publicity. I knew if I could just get her to come up here and see what was going on, she'd make a noise the whole world would listen to. Then when I heard what she had to say about Singh on the television (laughs) I knew that was the poacher I wanted her to see close too. She'll tell the world what these bastards are doing. - You arranged for me to take Micah. And you called Singh and told him to go to Fred Johnson's knowing I'd show up there with her. But how in the hell did you know the elephants would be out of the parks? Oh, you knew the elephants would be out of the parks because you drove them out. - And you played your part very nicely. - My part, huh? - You're insane. Did you even go to Sekomo today, Ian? And what about Watson? (scoffs) That's just great. You've got a girl out there with a fucking madman and you killed my Watson, you did! And it's all for the fucking cause. Well, the cause is not worth that. - Ah, but it is, you see. You see, it's not just a simple manslaughter this time. It's murder, maybe even Micah's murder. Front pages everywhere. We'll probably save tens of thousands of animals. - Don't tell me about saving animals, Ian. I've been fighting to preserve them all my life. But I will not be involved in the manipulation of evidence like this and the creation of bullshit incidents. That's my friend. You self-righteous bastard. You have no right to play God. - All I did was tell a few harmless lies. You and Micah and Singh did all the rest. And human nature, hatred, greed and love even. You can't track him in the dark. Never mind, he'll wait for you. I imagine there's nothing he'd like better than to get you alone in the wild. - You son of a bitch. I'll take care of you when I get back. In the meantime, you get a shovel and bury Watson. And do a good job, Ian. Or I'll come back and break your goddam neck. - Yes, Mark, yes. You'll see. I know I'm right. (dramatic music) - All right, let's see if you can catch me now, you son of a bitch! Yeah, the leopard's ticking on the big man. Come on, Mr. Hunter! Let's see if you can hunt! (dramatic music) (door thuds) (engine revving) (engine puttering) (birds chirping) (engine puttering) (birds squawking) - I'm right, I know I'm right. I've gotta be right. - He's dead. - I know I'm right, I know I'm right. (dramatic music) (engine puttering) (water lapping) - Kind of looks like somebody's coming. - Yeah, it's Roger. - Roger, who's he got with him? - Roger a man who always did move fast. - Mm-hmm, (laughs) Roger, fast mover. (engine puttering) (brakes squeaking) - Where's the smiling man? - [White Shirt] He's gone down to the bush. - Ah, tell him not shit on the company's time in future. - He's taking an elephant down there. How's that? - Yeah, that's good, that's good man. Now there's another 100 elephants out there. It's another 200 tusks. (men groaning) (blows thudding) - [Micah] Stop it, stop it! (Micah screaming) - Roger, cool it, cool it, Roger! Killing him is crazy, cool it! - Get up! (birds squawking) Put these on! Now you guys, go and collect the tusks, eh? And keep an eye out for that game warden. He'll be around here in a minute. Yeah, just stay out of his way. It's not you he's looking for. I'll meet you at the river crossing. - Well be there tonight. - Yeah, you think I still got my iron? - Take him down, man. - Would you like to see what the poacher does for a living, Miss Hill, since you're so interested, come on. (dramatic music) Take her. Let's see if I've still got my eye on, eh. - You have to be the best in the business. (gun firing) (Micah screaming) Maybe the lady would like to see what we do next. - She'd love it. Hurry up on with those axes or I'll give you another kicking. (dramatic music) (birds cawing) You, watch, watch! (ax thudding) Watch! (Micah sobbing) (birds cawing) That's good, boys. Stay cool, it's nearly done. (axes thudding) - Why are you doing this to me? Is it because of what I said at the airport? Is that your reason! - You're just bait, girl. (birds cawing) (birds chirping) (dramatic music) (monkeys screeching) - Even an animal eats what it kills. You kill for greed, nothing else. You're sick with greed, that's why you killed that man. (brakes screeching) - Not always, Miss Hill. Today I'm going to kill for revenge and that might be sweetest of all. - You gonna kill me now or rape me first? (dramatic music) (engine puttering) (brakes screeching) (gentle music) (birds chirping) - (sighs) There's no escaping, girl. No escaping. (engine puttering) (birds cawing) (somber music) (door thudding) (dramatic music) (vultures squawking) (engine puttering) (birds chirping) (gun clicking) (gun firing) - What did you shoot it for! - Don't be impatient. I need you alive a little bit longer. Get in the Getty, conservation lady. (birds chirping) (engine puttering) (suspenseful music) (engine roaring) (dramatic music) (metal clanking) (train chugging) (dramatic music) (train whistling) (gun clicking) - Where's Roger? First shot's gonna smash your kneecaps and then I'm gonna shoot every joint in your body. Where is he? - I dunno. - Come on, man. You met up with him a while ago back where you slaughtered that bull and you're gonna take me to him. - But I can't do it, man. I can't do that! (blow thuds) (poacher screams) No do. - You gotta take me to him! (blow thuds) - Ouch! Okay, okay, okay. - All right, move. My vehicle, move! (engine puttering) (footsteps tapping) - Hi, Mrs. Taylor. - John, where's Ian? Ian, oh, Ian, I've been so worried! Where have you been? I thought you were stuck out in the bush with no gun. I thought something terrible had happened. - No, no, no. - [Jane] You're all right? - Yes, yes. - What has happened? You look a wreck. - Nothing, nothing really. - Well, where's Micah. She has the reception tonight. Well, there's the painting. It should be framed. What's it doing here anyway? What's going on! - There's been some trouble. - [Jane] What? - It's all part of the plan. - Ian, what are you talking about, what plan? Where is Micah anyway? - Jane, listen, Micah has been kidnapped by Roger Singh. - What! - There was nothing I could do. Mark, Mark's gone after him. - You were there! You left them? Why aren't you with Mark? You're just standing there! And you John, why aren't you after them? - Everything's all right, everything will work out, you'll see. - The hell it will! I'm going to the police. You bastard! (dramatic music) - [Ian] I didn't mean to kill her. It was an accident. (gasping) (dramatic music) (engine puttering) (elephant trumpeting) (gun firing) (Micah screaming) (elephant groaning) (body thudding) (Micah groaning) (somber music) (engine puttering) (gentle music) (Micah moans) - No! (Roger laughing) - Hey. - Okay, come on lad. Come on, let's see if you can really do it. (Roger laughing) Okay. You stay right there. Stay back or I'll shoot you. I'll do it. You're not gonna go on killing whatever you want. What are you trying to prove, big macho man. We're gonna stand right here until Mark shows up. - If you expect me to stay here til Mark shows up, Miss Hill, you're gonna have to do more than just aim that gun at me. You're going to have to pull the trigger. Go on, shoot me. Or maybe you'd like to rape me first. (birds chirping) Move over. You'd better get accustomed to killing, Miss Hill. Just to prepare yourself to see your friend Mark being blown away. (engine puttering) (dramatic music) (birds squawking) - Which way? (water gurgling) (engine puttering) (glass clattering) - You better get the truck over. I'll take the Land Rover across, you carry the stuff over by hand. Good man, good. Now you know what you got to do, men. (water gurgling) (brakes squeaking) Come on, you fuckers, move that ivory. - Don't you worry, we are coming, boss. - Cross the river to Tanzania. There's wilderness over there. It's where we're going, you, me, your boyfriend. (engine puttering) (Micah groaning) Time to play, eh? - Yeah, Roger, yes! (Micah groaning) (somber music) (engine puttering) - All right, move over. You drive. - [Poacher] What man, I drive? - Yeah, now, move. Come on, let's go. (engine puttering) (dramatic music) (gun firing) (man groaning) (Micah groaning) (gun firing) (dramatic music) (guns firing) (body thudding) (guns firing) (engine revving) (gun firing) You okay? All right, wait here. (gentle music) (engine revving) (somber music) - Come on, bitch. - It's okay, come on, we're gonna get you to the doctor. We'll go after him later. I just want you out of here. - Come on, come on, you bastard! Come and get me, man. Come on! (dramatic music) (gun firing) (animals whimpering) (lion roaring) (monkeys screeching) (dramatic music) Come and get me! (gun firing) (buffalo lowing) (hooves thundering) (buffalo sniffing) (engine revving) - Can't hear him? By the time you get back to him, he'll have killed everything in sight. - Can you drive? - All right, all right, we'll try and cut him off and I'll circle around on foot. He won't try and cross that river. I want you to rest for a few minutes. He can't get far. (buffalo sniffing) (quiet music) Jesus, you've been through hell. I just can't believe Ian would do this. - Ian? - Yeah, the bastard set you up. He set me up, he set up the whole goddam thing. (buffalo lowing) Jesus, run like hell! (dramatic music) (head banging) (Mark groaning) (buffalo moaning) (hooves thudding) (gun firing) (body thudding) Micah, you okay? - Yeah, are you all right? - Yeah. - I'm glad you killed it. - I had to, it charged us. There's nothing more dangerous than a wounded buffalo. And you're right about Singh, we gotta stop him. All right, you drive slowly, hang back and I'll circle around on foot. (engine puttering) (dramatic music) (birds chirping) (suspenseful music) (elephants trumpeting) (gentle upbeat music) (dramatic music) (elephants moaning) (somber music) (gun firing) (dramatic music) (elephants trumpeting) (engine puttering) (dramatic music) (gun firing) (elephants trumpeting) (gun clicking) (engine revving) (body thudding) (somber music) (Micah crying) - It's okay. It's over. (gentle music) It's okay now. It's okay. Hey, let me show you the elephants, real up close. Okay? Don't be afraid. Gotta trust me. (both laughing) It helps if you smell like one. Now we both look like a heap of shit. (both laughing) Come on. (elephants moaning) (gentle music) (gun firing) (gentle upbeat music)
