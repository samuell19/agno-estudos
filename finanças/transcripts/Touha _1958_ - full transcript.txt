THE BOY WHO WANTED TO FIND THE END OF THE WORLD Caw, caw! Follow me! The world ends there, we won't catch the crows there. You dummy! lt's no end of the world, it's just the forest! Have you ever been there? The end of the world! The end of the world! I see it! - It is the end of the world! - It isn't! - It sure is! Good day. - Good day. What's your name, boys? - l'm Joey Malina. l'm Svatos. - From where? From Lucna. - Where's your father? He's at work. - Good. Where's the end of the world? - Nowhere. And if l kept going on and on, would l get to the end of the world? No and the world wouldn't end. And if l flew by plane, would l get there? You wouldn't. Where would you fly? Where did the crow find my little sister? You're a proper Paul Pry, aren't you? Go home, boys, your parents must be worried. Dad! What are you doing up there, Joey? Hello, Dad. - Hop on, hurry! We'll be celebrating today. - How come? We didn't make a cake. No, but l'm bringing your mum and baby sister home. Gee! Go and get auntie. She'll help us tidy up. Hurry up! What's up, son? - Nothing. Have you found out who brought your little sister? - Not yet. How can that be? - l don't know. Ask auntie. - You know it too. Ask her, she knows better. - The crow brought her, didn't it? lt did. - Go and tell your father that l'll come. Give me the cowslips! - l won't! Give them to me! - l won't. - Give them to me! - No! Give them to me. Give them to me. Zdena ... Have they hatched? - What? - The chicks. - You silly! What did auntie say? - That she'll come. - But when? Cackle-Cack. Cackle-Cack. Put it on the stove. Daddy ... - What? - How was Barb born? Not now. - You know how! You're too little for that. And does the stork or the crow bring babies? Neither. l'll tell you some other time. l'm busy now. l know how it is. - How is it then? Babies are born from an egg. - An egg? Like a chicken. - You don't say! What took you so long? - What have you done to the floor! The wood will rot. - Why? lt's high time for Anna to come home. Be good, Joey. - l will. Don't climb anywhere. - l won't. - Don't get dirty. Wait and l'll bring your mummy and little sister home. We'll come in an ambulance. Stay home and be good to make mummy happy. And do what auntie says. Understand? - l will. Good. l know that the crow or the stork doesn't bring babies. Who told you that? - Daddy. And he also said that l was too little. Go outside, Joey. Go, boy. Here, kitty. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. Hop! Are you going to bring Barb? We are going to bring Barb home! - Give it to her. Be careful, Joey, your sister is there. Joey! Who are you? - l'm your sister. She did hatch from an egg after all, Daddy. She hatched from an egg, from an egg ... What did l tell you? Where have you been? Come closer. What did l tell you? What happened to your hand? Let me see. Don't cry, Joey. Joey ... My boy ... lt is not proper for a boy like you to behave like this, is it? Are we old friends or not? - We are. There you have it. Go to your little sister. Mummy ... You're my sweet little boy. Don't cry, Barb. PEOPLE ON EARTH AND THE STARS IN THE SKY Don't you dare stepping on my field! lf you set your foot on my field again, l'll rip you in half! What? - l'll rip you in half! Father, Father! Uncle! Dad! - Leave us alone! You ought to cool them down with water. - You'd do that better than me. You mean like first aid? - lt wouldn't surprise anyone. lt will be right here. l'll make a plan for you tomorrow. l often wonder how people can quarrel about such trifle. We're nothing compared to the Universe. lt's easy for you to say if you have nothing. All that talk about the Universe may sound nice, but it's always best to have a piece of solid earth under your feet. Lenka, come and give us a hand! Well? - Nothing. Listen, Lenka ... May l call you by your first name? Are you looking for something solid too? - What do you mean? l mean in life. - Me? No. And have you found something solid? Not yet. l did find something though. - And what is that? lt's far away. - How far? Very far. Why don't you come over to the observatory to see for yourself. Can l come too? - Why not. lt's interesting. We'll come. Won't we, Lenka? Do you see it? - l do. lt's Saturn. The spiral nebula in Andromeda. l see it. Why didn't your sister come? - She couldn't. Why are you a land surveyor if you're so fond of the stars? You've never been disappointed, were you? Were you ever disappointed? Maybe. - By what or whom? By everything. What is it that you want from life? - Everything. What does everything mean? - Everything. People will never have everything. - But l want everything. l still think l failed the exam. There were so many of us. l don't really know anything. You couldn't have failed. You're the cleverest of all. The prettiest of all. You want me to leave? No. But you have to. You'll go your way, whether l like it or not. You will never leave me, will you? How long will we live? A long time, sweetheart. A long time. Well? - l passed the exam. Are you happy? You kept telling me that it would turn out well. And it did turn out well. Will you keep thinking about me? Will you remember? Will you go to our places? Will you? Good evening. - What brings you here? Good evening ... - Are you still quarrelling with your brother-in-law? Never mind. Here, have a drink with me. Thanks, but not tonight. - Why are you so down today? Never mind. - lt seems you do mind. What happened? Did she jilt you? No, not that. - What happened then? She left. - So what! There's more than one pebble in the creek. - And what if there isn't? Nonsense! lt would be a sin against nature. lf she's really fond of you, she'll come back. How old is she? Seventeen. lt's always the same story. lt's no use bothering. She's like a colt. She wants freedom. You can't harness her straight away. Not to worry. You'll sleep it off in a day or so, once you've cleared your head. - You're absolutely right. l'll write you a letter as soon as l get there. - l'll be waiting. Will you write me letters? Will you? l'll miss you. Heavens! Where are the eggs for aunt Mary? - Here, in the basket. l'm sure l'd sit on them. l'll never stop loving you. ANGELA Lord, l thank you for everything. Do not leave us in times of trouble and keep our father. Give me strength. Save us from anguish and wrong-doing. And do as should be done. Our Father in heaven, Hallowed be your name, Your kingdom come, Your will be done, On earth as in heaven. Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. Good day. Good day. - What can l do for you, Angela? You know more than well. l can't go on like this. You know l can't lower your deliveries. They're set by regulations. Everybody could ask the same. You can tell that to somebody who has a family to help him out and not to a woman earning a bare living on her own like me! lf you weren't so stubborn and joined the cooperative, you'd be better off. lf l weren't so stubborn?! After what you've done to me? When you took away my fields and put me in the hills? Let bygones be bygones. We don't do such things anymore. Stop nattering! And you stop singing and begging, Angela! Your delivery is set and that's that! - You'll never see me here again! One can't claim justice here! You won't force me to change my ways! Whenever that woman starts bawling me out, l can't help myself. Did you do her wrong? - Do her wrong? You haven't been here long, but l've been living here all my life. You mustn't believe everything you hear, you could get duped easily. lf you only knew what has become of that young Pavelka. He used to walk on his shoe strings but now he's a know-all. Afine ride, isn't it, good brother? - Fine. No wonder when it's the archbishop's harness and you're heading to my field. lf only your poor late mother knew that you never go to church, she would never forgive you! - Gee! Good day. - What brings you here, Angela? Tell me, sir, why are people so bad to one another? You ought to go among them, Angela. You're a sound woman, you would do them much good. l've been drudging all my life. l've never owed anything to anybody. l gave flour to people during the war. Why can't l have some peace now? What's the matter, Father? - We saw Michael, Angela. He gave this to me. - He was at the sawmill. Stop it, Johnny. - What did he say? That he'd come over during his leave to help you out with the harvest. He sends his regards. - l'm so glad. Shoo! Don't let the fowls in the house, Father. You haven't finished your coffee yet? Come here. My legs, my legs ... l fell out with Pavelka again. You mustn't do that, Father. Don't make me hide everything from you. Here chicky chicky chicky! Here chicky chicky chicky! Chick-chick-chick! Whoa! Where are you going, Johnny? This isn't our field any more. lt wasn't me. Uncle Michael! Whistle! Whistle, Uncle! Whistle! Once more! Whistle once more! Once more! Once more! Michael! l was afraid you wouldn't come. Me? The rye has ripened nicely this year. Pliers. And a fourteen. Not this one, a monkey wrench. - Here. - The bigger one. Here you are. - Damn! Damn? - Never mind. lt's no use. Damn it! ls this all you've cut since morning? - Since the morning. l would have cut that with a scythe. - Sure, l know. But only nettles for your geese. And you'd only cut yourself with a razor! You bet! - When we need advice we'll come to you and that Black Beaut? of yours. Be careful or Black Beauty might kick you! After you, gammer, and l'm sure it wouldn't hurt a bit, because it's no horse but a cat! He's a cat as you are combiners. Gee, Blackie! Hail work! - May the Lord permit! Forever, amen. That's how l like it! Angela ... Let's start bundling. Gee, Blackie! Gee! Give me the whip. Let's wait. He's working hard all day. News from the Local National Council. Our cooperative is the first in the district to fulfil its obligations toward the state, delivering 100% according to plan. When will you start flailing? - Tomorrow. What will you do after harvest? Will you go back home? Stay here, Michael. - What would l do here? Don't act like a fool. The whole village knows. You ought to marry her! - lt's easy for you to say. What? - lt's easy for you to say. Easy or not, if you don't know how to handle a woman, you can't call yourself a man. lf l were in your shoes ... Angela is worth it. lt's going well, Father. What's inside that counts. lt's pouring rye, eh? What do you want? - To have a look. l thought you came to give a hand. - l'm busy. Why didn't you load some bags? - We had none to load. We began late. - l see. You came to see how much rye l had, didn't you? - l did not! Yes you did! You always come asking when you set my deliveries! - Don't talk nonsense! Nonsense? lt seems l'm not allowed to say a single word! You will deliver the prescribed volume! l won't let you disrupt our village! What am l disrupting? - You know more than well! You'd better watch out or l'll teach you a lesson! You won't teach me anything! You won't threaten me! For heaven's sake why? l should've chased him out when he begged my father to let him paint our house! Get out of my yard! lt's still mine! You'll regret it, Angela! - l'm not afraid of you! Get out! Don't be foolish, Angela. - Did you hear what that urchin said? Am l a disrupter? Tell me who l am disrupting? l mind my own business! - Enough talk! Climb upstairs, we have to finish it today. Let it be, Pavelka. - She's an old hag. She's really getting on my nerves. - lt's all your fault. How come? - l've told you so many times, but you don't seem to understand. You ought to look at it from her point of view. ls that you, Michael? - Yes. Come on in. l've run out of matches. We're lucky we flailed all the rye. Wait. lt's too much for you, Angela. You have nothing but worries and l have enough of all that wandering. But never mind, l just wanted to tell you ... As l had done years ago ... That if you want ... You're a kind man, Michael. l don't know what l'd do without you. But my answer is the same as back then. Turn off the light when you leave. The Angel of the Lord declared unto Mary and she conceived of the Holy Spirit. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb ... lt gave me a hard time. Angela ... What are you doing, Michael. Mother! Angela ... Angela! Angela! Michael! Michael! Michael! My legs, damned legs. Damned legs. Teacher, teacher! Angela is sick. Don't worry, Angela, l'll stay till you return. l'll look after everything. You're a handy fellow, Michael. Angela is coming home soon. l want to put it in order before l leave. Good day. - Good afternoon. Halt! Stop! Will you finish the field by the Stones today? Go to Angela's field after. - What? To Angela? Don't be kidding! - Stop fooling around and get going! All right. But if she starts chasing me with a whip, l'll send her to you. - You can do that. Don't talk to her, just plough her field. And not a word about me! How many times did you stay with us and went away again. To return in the summer. They're already gathering. Gee! What will you give me for ploughing your field? Stop making a fool of an old woman and get out of here! Don't you feel sorry for that poor horse? Give me a bottle of rye brandy and l'll plough your field! l don't need your help! - You don't believe me, do you? Look, l'll do it in no time. Get out of the way or l'll run you over! l'm not moving an inch! - Go away! Get out of the way, l'll plough it for you! MOTHER You've been barking all day, Rek. You need some friends, don't you? Just you wait, you rascal. Good day, Mrs. Hynkova. - Anything for me? Nothing. They haven't come yet? l'm still waiting. - Goodbye. Come, Rek. Good day. - Good day. Are you a good boy at home, Johnny? - Yes, ma'am. My father shot a huge muskrat yesterday. And it had a big tail. This big. That's nothing. l can catch a muskrat that big on my own. And what about you, Liddie, has your father come back? No, mummy said he wouldn't come back. Go, children. Go ahead. Are you waiting for me, Liddie? Come, dear. Good day, Mrs. Hynkova. - Good day. How are you? - Good day. l feel the last hill to climb is not far away. Oh no. You still look more than well. lf only we didn't have to climb up so many hills. - lndeed ... Goodbye. - Goodbye. Good day. Welcome home. - Good day, Mrs. Bravena. lt used to be so nice here. You know how things are. - Your mother takes it hard. lt's too much for her and you're away all the time. l know. Rek! Rek! Come here, you old chum. Where is mother, eh? Where's mother? Let's go to school together, eh? Come, boy! Goodbye, Mrs. Bravena. What do you want here, Rek? Shame on you! Get out! Mother! - My dear boy! l'm here and l'm staying for a whole week. Only a week? Such a short time! You know how it goes, Mother. Why didn't Jana come? - She couldn't. Rek, stop it, you rascal! Mr. Hynek. - Yes? - Mrs. Hynkova didn't feel well today at school. Where is she now? - She's on her way home. How are you, Vaclav? - Are you feeling better, Mum? l see that someone has been telling on me. lt's just my heart. What a beautiful day! l always imagined l would live with you like father. ln the house ... - You'll get used to it. Besides, look around. Everything is becoming desolate. - Why don't you move in with us. No, dear. lt's not easy to replant an old tree. You are young and l would get in the way. Why don't you come over for visit to rest for a while. And what about the school? - At least at Christmas. What would your brother say? He's at the laboratory all the time. He doesn't have a proper meal all year. You are married. You don't know what it's like. You'll come home for Christmas. We can't come. Jana is pregnant. l thought so! You ... l didn't do all that needed to be done. As usual, eh? l can do some things myself at my pace. And the rest can wait. We are like migrating birds, aren't we? We keep returning. - As long as we have a place to return to. Look after yourself, Mother. Of course l will. l'll be sixty in spring. Don't you worry. l still have something to wait for, don't l? l will read you a poem, children. Acacias. Pay attention. Acacias still green are slowly covered with snow. Chased by the falling snow, l walk by down a dark street Black crowds are marching down the long silent street. l wonder whether one of them at least sees the leaves so green. No, not a single soul sees the green leaves through the snow. Only two will notice you, brethren. Me and the flame flickering at the street corner. Did you understand the poem, children? Nature is covered with snow and it is sleeping. And only those who truly love, do not forget. Behave yourselves, children. l have to leave. What brings you here, Jana? We are Mrs. Hynkova's sons. And is there nothing you ...? Can we see our mother? Of course. Mother ... Mother. My dear boys, you've come after all. l couldn't wait to see you. Jana sends her regards. She'll be very happy to see you when you come to us. Rek. - He doesn't want to eat anything. And when l let him go, he keeps looking for her. Quiet, children! Whose dog is it? - lt's our teacher's Rek. Our father wanted us to become beekeepers. Our willows are still here. Do you remember when we were small how we wanted mum and dad to remain young forever? Have you seen Mr. Hynek? Have you seen Mr. Hynek? You've got a baby! You've got a baby! You've got a baby! - A boy or a girl? Heavens, l forgot to ask. They didn't tell me. - lt doesn't matter! l wanted a girl anyway! But what if it's a boy? The End
