In the 16th century, after the capture ofatahua/pa, there were still tribes that did not surrender to the conquerors. To counter Spanish's firearms, masters of the rumi maki tried to spread a deadly technique amongst the incas: "The fist of the condor". But the Spanish stole the sacred manual. The few remaining rebels gave their lives rescuing the book, and the only survivor escaped with it so it'd never fall into wrong hands again. The legend says he hid in a mountain in the southern part of the world. Whoever had an honest heart would inherit the technique. This is how the manual has been passed down from generation to generation. These warriors are called "masters of the fist of the condor". I haven't fought in six years. I needed time, but it was too much. Sooner or later, someone would arrive looking for the same thing. What all lost warriors seek. I have to be ready. Ready if he finds me, or if! Find him. I feel my body working like a clock. Like a race car. I feed it the best. I've spent years calibrating myself. I've been my own experiment. Until I found balance. Anything less, I would lose voltage. Anything more would slow me down. He knows about my photophobia, but how? It's not just blindness. It's intense pain. You are not the best. Not the fastest. Master, but you told me... It was what you needed to hear. So now what? Get on with your life. Keep training. Don't look for him until you're ready. I'm going to find him and defeat him. You will not be able to. You still don't understand. He is the perfect fighter. With your conventional training, you have no chance. What scares me is how much you admire him. How can I not admire the purity of his martial arts? Years training in the mountains. Everything he sacrificed to become what he is. He defeated his own teachers and feels no guilt. He left his conscience behind. He does not follow doctrines or laws. He is an animal! I don't buy those cheap stories. Save them for your younger students. Wait. They say he has the same achilles heel as his brother. "You got to understand you are nothing", the master used to say. You have nothing to prove, nothing to defend. Look at your pain. Look at it from its core. Inhabit it and transform yourself into it. Let your weight take you to the bottom. Throw everything away until you are weightless. Throw everything away except your dignity. And your weightless body will fly. Breath in and fight with the only thing you kept for yourself. The stories about you were true... All of them. Who do you think I am? The master of the fist of the condor. No, it's not me. It is my twin brother. And I want to kill him too. This was a sign. And I can see the path again. I have come too far to give up who I am. It's time to keep looking for him. I was lost, but was meditating. Now I know where the sun sets, and where it will rise the next day. At what point exactly did I leave my original path? I am not the man I wanted to be. Nor the man I was before. It isn't his fault. I can't blame him. I can't blame anyone. Although sometimes I think he sends them... I am not the one you are looking for. Repeat it. Repeat it a thousand times until your nervous system makes it its own. Until it becomes a reflex, an electrical impulse. I'll tell you for the last time. I am not the one. They told me he was in this town, and here you are. I know your face. You're after my brother. That's a lie, you don't have a brother. You just say that so we don't take your book. What book? The manual you stole from the school of the condor. Give it to me! You'll have to keep looking. The book! And now what? Open your own school or go around the world challenging masters. I know you're keeping a secret. That's what you are talking about... Shortly after my last Dan, I dueled a vagabond. And what I saw was out of any martial arts fantasy. He trampled me as if I were a worm. Instead of getting mad, I asked him to be my teacher, but he told me that it was not his path. And before he left, he told me in a low voice, "lost in the mountains, in the southern part of the world, there is a school that defies the laws of gravity." Did you look for it? It is a school you cannot pay to attend. The master chooses his students by their honest hearts. Did he choose you? Yes, he did. When I was there, there were only two students. Myself and a woman who the master named "the condor woman". He named me "the worm man". Can you guess how the story ends? The condor ate the worm. Not just that. I ended up seeing a psychiatrist. And his explanation for my failure was that my mind was too structured. And what do you mean by "defies the laws of gravity"? I want to find that book as much as you do. Give me the bag! Maybe he is sending them, but not this one. Firearms are not his style. "Forgive him", master wook told me. But he also told me that he was the devil. Is it possible to forgive the devil? Maybe. But first I have to find him and look him straight in the eyes. So he is back on the road. Is he still on that motorcycle pretending to be the renegade? Yes, he is. And he shaved his head like a monk. I'm not surprised. He must be insane by now. Insane or not, the rumor is that he used the fist of the condor. The question is how he used that technique if there is only one manual, right? Well... It would appear the old lady made a copy. But there should be just one copy. That's what you taught me. The one who was able to protect the book deserved it. Clearly, someone broke the tradition. Or you think they took it from me? May I ask you a question? I hope you don't get offended, but... Are you sure you have it? I am sorry, master. Find my brother. Take the manual from him. If you can defeat him, the book will be your reward. Didn't you want to kill him yourself? Only if he defeats you, he would deserve to confront me. I'm afraid I'll have to deprive you of that pleasure. He deserves to get his revenge and I deserve his punishment. And in return, I deserve my revenge and he deserves my punishment. Training in a fasted state. Fasting activates survival instincts, animal instincts. The brain is alert and the senses are enhanced. You're ready to hunt. "Watch the outside, but more importantly, watch the inside", master would say. What's in there? Is the evil guest still in there? I'm going to show you something new. The logs. Show us. That is the first step. The second step requires you to get rid of the evil guest, the ego. You must get rid of it to reduce your weight. Remove the logs! It's physically impossible, but that's because you think you know. The worst ego trap is believing that you know. Jump! Feeling important makes you heavy, clumsy, and futile. To be a warrior you need to be light and fluid. The ego is the inner Satan. If you want to kill him, you have to see him first. That's what meditation is for. They asked me if I was the crazy guy who believes he is caine from kung fu. They say there's a crazy guy out there that likes to beat people up. Challenging whoever crosses his path. A nice kick in the balls is what I'm gonna give that mofo. Some water, please. Water? Is this the guy? Instead of caine he looks like a dickhead. Look at him. Who the heck does he think he is? He smells like shit! Hey, no need... Relax, dude. There are people eating lunch. We don't want anyone smelling like shit. It's best to shower to get that smell off of you. Get out of here, you fucking freak! Wow! Jackie chan! Wow! He is going to take the book. He is going to take the manual. Hey, babe. Hey. Hey! Check this out. Hey, babe. Hey. You look too good to be with him. Come sit with me, honey. Cut it, or I'll smash your teeth. Wow! Let's see it. Come get me. A beer, please. This freak again. What did I tell you? You can leave now and walk out like a man or stay and be dragged out like a dog. What you think is bravery is just your insecurity. You need to prove yourself superior. But you won't be able to prove that against me. I should have said this earlier, but I'm not a monk. Do you want to walk out like a man, or be dragged out like a dog? You bought me a beer earlier. This round is on me. Hey guys! Come on! Let's kill this freak! Let's go! I know your master. Why don't you just hand over the fist of the condor? It's a little cramped in here. In the abandoned warehouse near the school. Five in the morning. It will be an honor. So be it. When a warrior decides to do something, he must know why he does it. Only then can he focus every cell in his body on the task that lies ahead. He knows that if he wastes his strength, he could be crushed like a twig. I should meditate and fast until the duel. I fasted, but I could not meditate. I was only able to remember. Master wook told me about the school. I shouldn't have told anyone, but I told my brother. We made a pact. If they chose just one of us, the other one would accept it without envy or resentment towards the other, and he would wait until the training was finished. When the chosen one finished his training, he would share everything he had learned. They are listening to the earth. You stay. Youleave. But it's unfair. He has more talent than me. Talent is not what matters here. What matters is the passion. The passion of the warrior, talented or not, is what makes him reach the top, even if his mountain is higher. And you? Do you have passion? Yes. Then you will start off in the kitchen. Hey, birdie! Always be on the lookout. You must see with your body, not just your eyes. To remember this, keep your index finger down. Birdie! Beautiful! Birdie, you have worked hard, without complaint and with passion for a whole year. Now I want you to begin learning martial arts. Who is it? You don't recognize him? My brother? It turned out that he had a lot of passion. Don't you think? Who are you training? Him or me? Do you like watching him? I feel sorry for him. That's exactly how we live our lives, but our cage is invisible. Why don't you set him free? I have opened the cage, but he comes back. He prefers safety. What could happen to him? His brother was eaten by a condor. Do you know where to find him? He is by the coast. Don't forget, you will only be able to defeat him if you get inside of his head. What can I say to him? Bring him a souvenir from his master. Master wook? Wook was like his father. Excuse me, master. May I ask you another question? I know it doesn't concern me, but it might help to mess with his mind. What did you do to your brother? Forgive him. Or... Are you going to live for revenge? It's not revenge. Then what is it? He doesn't deserve the fist of the condor. But he has it. And he had everything that was mine. Stay. I'll be back. I won't talk to her about you anymore. Why did you leave them? The path of the warrior must be traveled with no luggage. Who told you that foolishness? A warrior follows the path he wants, however he wants to follow it. Who's there? Good evening. What can I do for you? I'm looking for a souvenir. What? I am a student at the school of the condor. The school that you failed to finish. At least in those days it was an honorable school. Today it's a school for assassins. You may be right. This is my duel. Yes, master. Just one question... Yes, master. What did you do to him? My third year in the school of the condor, there were only two disciples. The other one left because he found it ridiculous and meaningless. The jerk said he just let her tease him because the school was for free. Tomorrow the season will change. And this spring will be different. It will be called "the season without legs". We are going to start with a 30 minute jog. To get to puma rock, it will take about 15 minutes. Run to the top, then come back down. I thought you only ate vegetables. Eating fats will help to maintain your voltage. The voltage that makes your heart work. Your cells maintain this voltage in their membranes, made of fatty acids. Not only must you maintain this voltage, you must also detect energy leaks. For example, an emotion. Sometimes an emotion affects you so much, you can't even move your legs. You have been patient and persistent. You have shown more passion than anyone. I want you to inherit this manual. Thank you, master. I tricked you and set you many traps to change the energy mode of your body, so you learn new ways of seeing. Here you will find all the steps to master the fist of the condor. It has all the writings on how to train, how to feed your body and your spirit. But listen. Use great discretion. The fist of the condor has power and wields death. It is only used if it is inevitable. It's not used to win personal duels. I promise not to, master. My photophobia is getting worse. The condor woman said I was going to go blind before I was 40. I wanted to see them for the last time. I sat for two days. Watching them from afar. She didn't know that I had a brother. Maybe she never had a chance to know. I stayed there two more days, thinking of a strategy to kill him, but in those years I was far from being a match for him. Trying could cost me my life. Ever since that day, every time I look in the mirror, I see the face of a coward. They say that when a condor begins to feel old, or loses their lifelong partner, they will throw themselves on to the rocks to meet their death. In a fight to the death there is no time to think. In a fight to the death only your instinct responds. That is why you must trust your inner animal. My master used to say there were warriors with such a powerful animal within that they could become a nagual. What is a nagual? Follow me. A warrior is tenacious. He spends so many years fine-tuning and perfecting that neat and tidy life, that he is not going to waste it in a passing combat. There is too much at stake. There is no room for silly mistakes. The stake is too high. That is why each action of the warrior is like his last battle. You must be his best student. Thank you. You're very kind. But there is a technique that I am missing. And you have it. You think he sent you to get the book. But he just wants to size me up. You are his Guinea pig. I can see that you went too long without training. Six years without fighting, right? If you give me the manual, I will spare your life. Go back to your master. Inherit the book from him. That is how it should be. Do you know what some people say? That you two are the same person. Half man, half demon. But I've seen you both. Do you know what was the last thing he said before dying? He said, "for the honor of a warrior..." Grant me one last wish. What is it? I want you to tell him... I'm not going to tell anything to anybody. You, old loser. The old man couldn't believe that I didn't Grant him his last wish. He did not die in peace. Talking about ugly deaths, you had a wife and a daughter, right? Poor things... To die thinking her own husband killed her. And the girl... I got goosebumps when my master told me. To die thinking that her own father killed her. That is macabre. Sometimes an emotion affects you so much, you can't even move your legs. My master was right. I only had to say a couple of words to bring you to your knees. The sadness of the warrior is a voltage blow to the chest that comes from the depths of the universe and spreads throughout the body. That voltage is neither good nor bad, the ego decides its value. A warrior can use that voltage to his advantage. What is a condor doing so far from the mountain range? The condor is believed to be the messenger between men and the divine world. They used to deliver the prayers, but it brought good and lousy omens. The incas would say that the condor, with their size and strength, was able to raise the sun over the mountains. One day you will have to confront him. And by then, you may be blind. But a warrior learns to walk in the dark. And only by reaching out into the deep darkness he can see himself.
