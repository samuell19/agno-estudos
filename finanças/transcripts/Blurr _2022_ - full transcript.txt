Why are you silent? Why don't you answer me? Please stop this music. You know I hate it. Didn't you hear what I said? Answer me, you b***! [English rap song continues] I know you are here. Watching me. Your stink fills up the room, even before you get here. Gayatri, what happened? What's happening? Hey, listen. Gayatri. Gaya... I am calling an ambulance. Gautami. It's Gautami. Something's wrong with her. Gayatri. I am fine, please call her. Give me the phone. 'Mobile subscriber you have called is currently not reachable.' You finally returned home six months later, and now you're running off again. I am not running off, Neel. She is my sister. She would've called if she needed you. Or at least answered your calls. And what about your research papers, when will you submit them? You can at least look at me, when I'm talking to you, damn it. Sure, Neel! I understand you're not coming, and that's perfectly fine. I want to go. Our parents bought two of everything. Because Gautami always wanted, what mom bought for me. Even my clothes. Everyone would laugh at us. Yeah, I know. Same old story. Sometimes I really wonder, how do you manage to stay sane? With both sisters? Gautami. Gautami. Gautami. She looks like sister Gautami, but she isn't like her. Sit down. Find her? Scared me. Gayatri, I don't think that's a good idea... Gautami. Gautami. Gautami. Gautami. Neel. She isn't at home. I'll go ask the neighbours. Gayatri. -What happened? -Don't go up there, please. -What's happened, Neel? -No. -Let me just go and... -No, Gayatri. -Let me check. -No. Please, stay here. Did you break the glass? Yes... my wife did. I should have been with her. I failed her. Gayatri, when was the last time you saw your sister? About six months ago. So... was she living here alone for the past six months? You two must communicate only by phone. I was in a remote area. Whenever I called her up, she never picked it up. Any kind of stress or misunderstanding between you two? Not at all! She was just... a little moody, that's all. Mr. Neel, did she ever speak to you? When she never answered Gayatri's call, why would she answer mine? She had progressive vision loss. She gradually lost her eyesight. And for the past year, she was completely blind. And even in that condition, she was living all alone out here. She chose to live here. No one forced her to. And please, I would suggest you investigate the crime. Gayatri. Madam, there was no crime. According to forensics assessment, your sister committed suicide. That's not possible. Gautami can never commit suicide! Please tell him, Neel. Look, nothing looks out of place, and there are no wounds or struggle marks on her body. Maybe her gradual loss of eyesight, became the reason for her depression. She wasn't depressed, if that's what you mean. Then why was she living here alone? She was waiting for a donor. She was a famous musician. She didn't wish to face her fans in that condition. In fact, we were all waiting for the surgery. I guess the wait became unbearable for your sister. If there is anything else, it will show up in the post-mortem. I'm leaving. [English rap song continues] No, my wife doesn't know. I'll speak with her. Yeah, okay. I'll call you back. Thank you. Dr. Aman called. He's out of town for a conference. But he said under no circumstance, shall you take any kind of stress. At any cost. And before you go back, he wants to check your eyes once. The light's back, Neel. Sweety, are you evening listening to what I'm saying? Did you hear that song? Before she died... She hated rap. This means she wasn't alone. Someone was with her. She is gone. She is gone. We'll never find out what she did and why. And we have to accept it, sweety. -We have to. -But, I want to find out. Gautami could've never committed suicide. Because there was rap playing on this music system? Because I know my sister, that's why? And I don't understand, why are you hell bent on proving this was a suicide? And I don't understand why do you think it's not. Go ahead. Stress yourself. It's good for you. It's very good for your eyes. This is exactly what the doctor ordered. Stress. God. I'll go fetch the torch from the car. Gayatri. Gayatri. Are you okay? Yes. Gayatri, what happened? I thought someone was in the room. I... I felt it. Sit down. Sit. Madam, the post-mortem reports have arrived. Everything is normal. Fingerprints? Just that of you two and your sisters. But the song... Someone was with her. Last night even I felt someone was in the room. Gayatri, you felt someone was there. -There was no one there. -Neel, we're here, because I felt something. We even spoke with the neighbours. But they didn't see anyone. I guess your sister was of reserved nature. Mrs. Solanki was the only one, who knew her. Mrs. Solanki who? Your neighbour. There's a rope at the back, that leads straight to her house. Come back soon, Gayatri, please. Mr. Neel, did you talk to your wife? Right now, I don't want to take a chance with her health. I understand this is your family's internal matter. But this is an integral part of my investigation. Rather than me telling her, you should speak with her. Mrs. Solanki. Ma'am? Excuse me. Gautami? No, aunty. Gayatri! Gautami's sister. Shhh... Your eyes are perfectly alright. What? Yes. Then why didn't you show up earlier? Why did you leave your sister alone? Yes, eat. Why did you come here now? -Did the police send you? -No, aunty. Actually, Gautami often spoke about you. In the beginning, she came over frequently. We used to go on long walks together. We'd sit on Mall Road, and brag philosophy. She would talk about melodies, and me about the art of drama. The story of a perfect drama, is like a melody. And, we actors are the singers. Umrao Jaan Ada. The show happened at Kamani Auditorium. I played the main lead of Umrao. See. Sit. Sit. -Sit. -Yes. I had to move here from Delhi, because of my son's health. I figured we'll move back in a couple of years. It's been 25 years. It's lovely, aunty. Aunty, Gautami's eyesight... She grew very emotional as she began to lose her eyesight. One day she said... I see people with my eyes closed. Beyond the discrimination of looks, complexion, and height. They look much better. Aunty, she was waiting for a donor... Never interrupt when a senior is speaking. Sorry. After that, she made new friends, and stopped meeting me. - New friends? - Of her age. Usha Nair and her gang, at the wellness center. Wellness center? Hobbies of the rich. If you have money in your pocket, dozens of specialists will convince you, even if you're crippled, handicapped, or blind, you can still lead a life filled with happiness. What's the point? Poor thing hung herself. In our... -Excuse me. -Yes. Where can I find Usha Nair, who trains visually impaired people? Her shift's over. Try the changing room, in the basement. What was her hurry to die? She had both money and influence. She would've found a donor eventually. Right. The rich come in and flash their money. And immediately find a donor. We've been waiting in queues for ages, but our wait doesn't seem to end. Shall we observe a minute of silence for Gautami? I see... Did you have a thing for her? -Shut up, b***. -Wasn't she your favorite student? What did you teach her? A cane or a canine, who's a blind man's best friend. Canines for the rich, and canes for the likes of us. She was pretty snooty. Considered herself nothing less than a star. Don't speak ill of the dead. So... now one has to die to get some respect. We all thought about it once at some point. But didn't do it. I slit my wrist once, to Kishore Kumar's songs. And also called the helpline. She always needs extra attention. Say what you must, but we always find a reason to live. Maybe she couldn't find one. She had a boyfriend. What other reason did she need? -She had a boyfriend? -Yes. Was he from around? Local? Don't know. But I heard they went to 'Saat Taal' together. Hotel Lake View. Hotel Lake View? What's out there? Rooms for romance. Have some shame! Someone's here. Yes, someone's here. -What? -Someone's here. Who is it? She... Who is it? Who is it? -Who is it? -Gautami? -Is it you, Gautami? -Don't talk nonsense, Usha. Gayatri. Gayatri, Gautami's sister. What were you doing here? Were you eavesdropping on our conversation? No, I just got here. And who is he? Who? Who? He's here too. -I am alone. -He's here. He came here with you. He's right behind you. Who are you? Why are you following me? Turn around. Madam. Are you alright? Gayatri. Where were you? I heard a warning on the radio, about the landslide. So, I quickly left for home. I was walking toward the parking lot, when madam showed up. Maybe she was looking for something. She got dizzy and fell. Gayatri, what the hell is going on? Neel. Neel, wait. Neel, now I am absolutely sure, Gautami didn't commit suicide. She was murdered. And whoever murdered her is after me. Who? I think the guy who brought me home. What are you saying? Neel, you can ask those girls. They were there too. Someone's following me, Neel. What girls, damn it. The girls who train blind patients at the wellness center. They told me Gautami had a boyfriend. And I have a feeling, he's now following me. Just... hold on a second. You've completely lost me here. Okay, you're saying that the guy outside, was Gautami's boyfriend! And now he's following you, are you saying that? Yeah, I think so. Do you think so? Has anyone seen him with Gautami? Have the girls seen him? They are blind, Neel. How could they? Good lord, Gayatri, Listen to yourself! Please listen to what you're saying. Have you seen his face? No, but I chased him. -I ran after him... -Lost consciousness and fell! Oh, God! Come here. Please, come. How many times did you have these seizures before? This was the second time. Look, I'll handle everything here, you are leaving for Delhi right bloody now. Neel, someone was following me. Why don't you believe me? The body will be released tomorrow. We're closing the case. No, no, no, you can't. No, you can't. I think the guy who brought me here, was following me. He's probably involved in Gautami's murder as well, sir. Madam, this is a tourist spot. People make a living out of tourism. People are welcomed here, they are not murdered. And the man you're speaking about, is your neighbour. He saw you in trouble, and helped you out on humanitarian grounds. He arrived there at the exact same time, wearing the same jacket my stalker was wearing. Madam, that guy works at the same wellness center. And you'll find jackets like these in every household. Actually, even I have one. -Yes. -Inspector. Since you're closing the case, I don't think there's any point in telling Gayatri anything. Okay, Mr. Neel. Inform everyone that we're bringing the body to Delhi, okay? Neel... Neel. More people, more opinions! Then what do you want? Mom always said you two are poles apart. You want to see the world, and Gautami wants the world to see her. She always got mom and dad's attention. After all, she was six minutes younger than me. Hello. It's really tragic. It wasn't her age to die. And she had such a pretty face, one can never forget. We didn't know each other too well, but my daughter Ira. They used to talk a lot. In fact, she is so shaken, that she won't step out of the car. Well... Ira was asking... Did you find any note? I mean suicide note. The police are investigating. May her soul rest in peace. A neighbour and his daughter. I didn't know she was so lonely. Hey, Gayatri. What happened? Hey! Are you okay? What happened? This is the end of this rubbish. Even if I've to tie you up and drag you, I won't hesitate. But I won't let you go crazy. Neel, why are you so controlling? I just felt like someone was there. Not a big deal. Yeah, of course, it's not a big deal. It's just that someone's following you, who you can't see. But you can feel he's there. That's it, you're leaving. Isn't it enough that Gautami's dead? I think you're right, Neel. I am stressed. But I don't want to go home yet. Can we go somewhere else, please? Just like old times? Please. Go where? I didn't know. When you said like old times, you were this serious. Hey, Gayatri. Are you kidding me? Sweetheart, remember, 'just like old times' you used to bring me to hotels like these. See love, 'just like old times' okay, but don't expect the same stamina. Go get the luggage from the car, and you can make excuses later. Yes, ma'am. Hi. Do you recognize her? She's my sister. She's... was... blind. She came to your hotel last week with a guy. This is the receipt. Can I have some details, please? Sorry, ma'am, we don't share guest information. I understand that, but this is personal and also urgent. So, if you can help? Sorry, ma'am. Look, she was found hanging from the ceiling of her house two days ago. Would you rather talk to me or the police? Let me check, ma'am. Here. Sorry, ma'am. Gautami Verma. There was a guy with her. There was no one, ma'am. She was alone. Why would anyone come to a hotel like this alone? Gayatri. Yeah. Is everything okay, sweety? Yeah. Thank you. I was just asking for restaurant recommendations for dinner. -I see. -Yeah. Shall we? Come, sir. Since when did you start preferring fancy restaurants? And I guess you're going to get a fat discount. The manager cannot take his eyes off you. Which manager? You think every guy is interested in me. I see... He's just being polite. What happened? My glasses? In the car's glove box. Hello, ma'am. Welcome back. As I said... brown. You're confusing me with my sister. You cannot get away like this, ma'am. A bet is a bet. Listen to me carefully. My sister came here a couple of days ago with a guy. -Yes, ma'am, there was someone. -Do you remember any details? Anything at all? Face? Name? I never asked his name, and I don't remember his face as such. Fine, do you remember any other details? Was he fair or dark, tall, or short? Any detail about the guy? Ma'am, he looked normal, like every regular-looking guy. You remember every detail about my sister. Ma'am, she was different. Plus, everyone was looking at her, because of her bandages. Bandages? Yeah, she had bandages on her eyes, she had surgery. That's why we made a bet. If I guess the color of her eyes right, she will have a cup of coffee with me. And I said the color of her eyes is dark brown. -So-- -Thank you. Thank you so much. Sure, ma'am. What's the matter? Are you planning on dumping me, and running away with the manager? Gayatri, are you okay? Neel, Gautami was here. With the same guy who those girls were talking about. Remember, I had told you. Gayatri, what are we doing here? Neel, she had bandages on her eyes. Do you realize what that means? She had surgery. She found a donor. She could see again. Why would she kill herself? You know how she was, right? The eye damage was pretty bad. The surgery wasn't successful. Gautami knew she would never see again. And how do you know? Doctor Aman told me on the phone the other day. Gayatri. Gayatri, listen to me. What other secrets were you keeping from me? -What else? -I was just protecting you. Really? Protecting me from what? The fear that someday you'll lose your sight like Gautami. Please... please, just listen to me. She took her life, because she didn't want to live in the dark. Okay, fine. What about the guy who was with her? Even if there was someone, what does that prove? Why doesn't he come forward? Why is he hiding from me? Maybe he dumped Gautami after he found out? That easy? Yeah, it happens. Okay, fine. Why is he following me now? God... I really don't know sometimes, why don't you believe me? Gayatri, nobody is following you. Gayatri, nobody is following you. Hey! What are you doing? Are you nuts? How can you not see such a big car? You didn't see the car, did you? You didn't see the car. Remember that day in Pehelgaum, when we lay on the ice for hours watching the sky. You were. What were you watching? The reflection of the sky in your eyes. You wrote a few lines in tribute to my eyes. Really, now? Yeah, let's hear it. Okay. "These eyes of yours," "darker than the night." "It has its own ambience, own stars." Me and my silly poetry. What if these stars fade out? They won't. Just because you wish that won't happen, doesn't mean it won't happen. I'll load the luggage in the car. Neel. Your glasses. It's so weird, isn't it? The guy who came here with your sister, no one remembers him. Isn't that weird? I've something that belongs to your sister. Will you come with me? Come. It was right here. I've recently become very forgetful. I found this after your sister left, under the bed. And what about the guy who was with her? Whom no one remembers? No one remembers doesn't mean he doesn't exist. He exists. He exists, and he's extremely angry. Like me. Even old folks become invisible to others after a point in time. It's been several years... Several years since anyone thought of me. Do you remember his face? Where he'd come from, or where can I find him? Every street in every city has thousands of people, whom people forget. Okay, thank you. Even you didn't ask my name. I am sorry. There's a municipality parking on Mall Road. There are cameras everywhere. That's where he parked his van. I've been waiting for you... -He's here. -Who? I know where to find him. Just stay here. Calm down, Neel. I am fed up! I am tired! Does anything I say make any difference to you? Relax. Just calm down. No, I am not going to relax! I am not going to calm down! First, those blind women said something, and we came to 'Saat Taal'. There you met some crazy old man, and dragged me out here! I can't take this shit anymore. And there is no mystery behind Gautami's death. You want the CCTV footage, I'll get it for you. After that, you'll stop this drama, understood? 'Mobile subscriber you have called is currently not reachable.' Excuse me. My husband came in here to check the CCTV footage. I don't know who he was, but he was asking for the footage. I refused. He put money in my pocket, and I gave him a copy. Is there another exit? He paid me to keep my mouth shut. Does this seem funny to you? I've been worried sick waiting outside for an hour! Do you want me to call the cops? You're getting angry, ma'am. There's an exit back there. -Did anyone else come here? -No, there was no one else. You can check the monitor if you like. Madam, move. What the f*** is this? What happened? Ma'am, it's me. Who took the hard drive? My husband's been kidnapped, and his life is in danger. Please send someone from the police station. 'Madam, so far all we know, is that someone stole a hard drive. That's all.' He's the same person who was with my sister. Please find him. 'Madam, how do we find a guy who no one has seen,' 'not even you.' There is someone who has seen him. Excuse me. -This way. -He's this way. Sir... Sir, please listen to me. There was only one guy who saw him, and he killed him too. -Meaning, he's cleaning his footsteps. -Look, it looks like an accidental death. Sir, I told you he'll go to my husband next. My husband is missing. He will kill him. -Please, relax... -How can I relax? My husband's life is in danger. -I am asking for your help... -Please, listen to me. Relax. Relax. What's wrong, ma'am? Careful, ma'am. Are you alright? Are you alright? -Ma'am. -Can't see a thing. Relax. Are you alright? Can't see anything. I cannot see. I can't see anything. Please find my husband. He is missing. He will kill him, sir. Can't see anything, sir. Alright. Here. We have to operate as soon as possible. No, doctor. At least not until Neel isn't found. Every day is precious, Gayatri. You could lose your eyesight completely any day. What's the point? Gautami's surgery wasn't successful. So, I am sure mine won't be either... Who told you that Gautami's surgery wasn't successful? Neel did. -You didn't speak with Neel. -Never. I never share patient details. And I don't know if there were complications later. She never called me after she left. And she didn't pick up my calls either. Hello, madam. If you don't know how to drive in the mountains, then why do you try? This is not how you drive in mountain areas. You could have killed us. Hello, madam. It's raining out here. Madam... -Mrs. Verma, are you alright? -Yes. Light has been seen in your house. I think your husband is back. Madam, be careful. Neel. -Neel. -Wait, madam. Wait here. I'll go check upstairs. Neel. Neel. Neel, you there? Neel, you there? Who's there? Who's there? Who's there? Help! Help! Inspector! Help! Inspector, help! Inspector! There's someone here. Inspector, help! There's someone here. -There's someone here. -Wait, madam. I'll check. Okay. There. Up ahead. Inspector, please switch on the torch, I cannot see anything. Inspector, please switch on the torch, I cannot see anything. Please, switch on the torch. It's too dark. I cannot see anything. 'One morning my husband stepped out of the house,' 'and never returned.' 'A couple of years ago, my son left me too.' 'How can anyone leave his mother alone like this?' 'I don't know what happened to the two.' At least you know. You should leave, child. This place doesn't suit you. Gayatri. Inspector Chandel is here to speak with you. 'Gayatri, I never could muster the courage, to say this to your face.' 'So, I...' 'You and I have been living alone for the past few months.' 'You in the jungles and me in the city.' 'From 'us' we were reduced to 'you' and 'me'.' 'And we also grew used to it.' 'But even when we were together, it felt like' 'my presence didn't matter.' 'I could never grow used to that.' 'A couple of months ago,' 'I paid Gautami a visit.' 'Things got easier for both of us.' 'I was trying to find you in Gautami, and I even succeeded.' 'Seemed like I'd known you for ages, and yet this was our first meeting.' 'I know, Gayatri. What happened was wrong.' 'But I was only trying to find you,' 'and not anyone else.' 'I am sorry.' 'Yours, Neel.' Your husband and your sister were having an affair. Their call records and messages prove this. Even though I tried to convince him, but he kept it a secret from you. Maybe they didn't want to face you. Or maybe they didn't want to live without each other. Just leave. Do you still believe these are murders? Please leave. We're closing this case. I am sorry. So little bit of itching is normal. But we can't take the bandages off for at least two weeks. Light is toxic to your eyes. But we're all here to take good care of you. So, you don't have to worry. Doctor, I want to go home. Absolutely not. It's out of the question. I think it's safe. Even the police have closed the case, so... But in your condition, alone? Not at all. You can send over a nurse, please. That will be okay. Alright. If you absolutely insist. Another thing, Gayatri. The police want to release Neel's body. Can you keep the body here, please? Please, I want to see him one last time. Sure. Thank you. Careful. Your bag. Thank you. Shall I wait until the nurse arrives? No. -Thank you. -Okay. Excuse me. Yes, ma'am. Can you check which lock in the house, does this key fit in? Sure, ma'am. Ma'am doesn't fit in any lock in this house. Okay. -Anything else? -No, thank you. Okay. Thank you, madam. Who is it? Ma'am, Deepak Joshi. Nurse. Doctor Raman sent me. There was a landslide on the way, that's why I got delayed. I tried calling you. Not a single female nurse in a hospital that big? Ma'am, this place is far away from the city, so female nurses don't prefer to come here. I live close by, so... What's wrong with your hand? The cut isn't too deep. It will heal by tomorrow. What do I do with the glasses, ma'am? Throw it away. -Come, I'll take you to your bed. -No. I can't see, but, I can still walk. Careful. Careful. Sit here. Get some rest, while I'll get you something to eat. Dr. Raman's calling. You can talk to him about my replacement. He's very trustworthy, Gayatri. His sister's been working with us for the past couple of years. And he's well equipped to handle any emergency, you know. Even if you call him at midnight, he'll be there. Which is difficult for a female nurse, you know. And I've already sanctioned a 15-day leave for him. Okay. Thank you, doctor. Ma'am, your food. Thank you. I am sorry... It's alright, ma'am. I can understand. And anyway, it's only for 15 days. You'll be fine. This is to be taken after food, at night. Okay. Do I come back tomorrow, ma'am? Okay then, I'll save my number on fast dial. Call me if you need anything, okay? I'll check what's in the house and where, before I leave. I can guide you. Okay. Fine. Here's your phone. Okay. Goodnight, ma'am. Goodnight. And thank you. It's okay, ma'am. Remember to take your medicines. Who is it? Who is it? Neel. Is it you? I trusted you. Don't say another word. I am here now, everything will be fine, okay? I promise. Let's first take these dirty bandages off. No, Neel. No. Neel. Neel, what are you doing? Neel. You want to go to Pehelgaum with me, don't you? -Neel no. -Let's get it off. Neel, no! -Neel. Neel no. No. Let's get it off. I promised you. -Leave me, Neel. -You made me promise. Leave me, Neel. -Neel. -I promised you. Neel, let me go. -I cannot break my promise... -Neel, you're hurting me. Let me go! -Why are you so stressed? -Neel. -The doctors warned you... -Leave me, Neel. -...against taking stress. -Leave me, Neel. It's bad for your eyes. Neel, it's hurting me. Neel, no! We were always together. -And you were always a loner. -Leave me. No. No. Neel, no! No, Neel! No. Call Inspector Chandel. -'Hello.' -Hi, sir. Sir, Gayatri. There is someone in my house. 'Madam must be some animal. It's quite normal.' 'It's 2 am. Go back to sleep.' No, sir. I heard someone climbing the stairs. Someone's here, sir. Madam, I considered you, and investigated the case from every angle. But now you'll have to give me some consideration as well. Just see what's the time. 'Call back in the morning. I'll send someone in the morning.' But sir, this is an... Call Deepak. Pick up. Pick up. Pick up. 'Hello.' -'Ma'am, is everything alright?' -Deepak, can you come over? What? Deepak, someone's in the house. Can you come over, please? 'Wait there, I'll call the police.' The police won't come at this hour. Can you come over or not? 'Yes, ma'am.' Hello, Deepak. -Are you... Deepak, are you there? -'Ma'am. Ma'am, I am coming.' 'Where in the house are you right now?' The room upstairs. Guest room. 'Okay. Okay.' 'Try to find the room and come outside.' Outside. 'As soon as you exit, the railing's on your right.' 'Grab it and slowly climb down.' 'Ma'am, are you okay?' 'There should be a door in front of you. Open it.' Someone's coming. 'Hello?' -Yeah... -'Can you hear me, ma'am?' Where? 'Ma'am, you are on the porch.' 'Walk straight.' -'Hello.' -Yeah. 'Hello.' 'Ma'am, there should be a door on your left.' 'It's the main door. Open it and come out.' 'Hello.' Ma'am, Deepak, Deepak. Deepak, there's someone in the house. -Someone's in the house. -Wait here, I'll check. -No, please don't leave me alone. -Okay. Okay. Please. Wait here, ma'am. The backdoor is open, ma'am. Must be some animal. It's normal. Come, let me change your dressing. Don't worry, it's dark here. You'll be fine. I was only 20, when I had a motorcycle accident. I had bandages for almost two months. Nightmares, weird sounds. My eyes healed, but I grew used to living in the dark. That's when I decided to do this job. You made this story up to make me feel better, didn't you? Not at all. Did you know, this complex system of nerves in our body. -What? -It's... The complex system of nerves... Nervous system. So, when our eyesight becomes weak, our hearing becomes more profound. Often, we hear things which aren't there. You talk just like a doctor. By the way, what do you do? I am an anthropologist. I live with tribal people, write about them. Do you understand anthropology? You know, anthropology... The study of the human race. Not bad. Careful. Yes. Careful, now turn. Sit down. Sit... Ma'am, can I say something? I know you're scared, but I can get rid of this fear if you give me a hand. The coffee machine is on your left, ma'am. Can you make coffee? Wow! Ma'am, there are cards laid out in front of you. Pick any one card. This is an ace of diamonds. And here's the jack. Clubs, right? Right, clubs. Not bad, it's fun. Not as difficult as it looks. One just needs a guide like you. Where is the phone ringing? At the back? And what's at the back? Living room. Then go and answer the phone. Okay, I'll try. Hello. Hi, doctor. Yeah, I'm feeling much better. No, there's no pain either. Deepak is taking good care. Yeah, you've sent the right person. Thank you so much. -Is it 7 o'clock already? -Yes. Stay a little longer. What happened? Is someone waiting for you at home? Who will wait for a male nurse, ma'am? Why? Why not? Wait just a little longer. The bandages will come off in three days anyway, -after that... -Are you scared? No... It's okay, go. Just three more days, ma'am. And you'll be able to see them again. I've seen so much in the last couple of days, I don't wish to see anything else. -Don't drink anymore, ma'am. -But... Let's assume that I am cured. Will you remember me, or will I be just another patient for you? Why assume, ma'am? You'll definitely be cured. But what if you don't want to see me after you're cured? Why do you feel that way? You've been a big help to me. I've never felt the need for anyone to date. I was used to doing my own work. So... I would want to see you first. What if you don't like what you see? Gautami used to say, see people with your eyes closed. Beyond the discrimination of looks, complexion and height. They look much better. I am... sorry. Okay. I am so sorry. Deepak. Deepak, I am sorry. I overstepped. My mistake. I am sorry. It's pretty late, I'm going home. Deepak, it wasn't your fault. My mistake. I am sorry. We can't do this with our patients. I shouldn't have had too much to drink. My fault. I'll talk to Dr. Raman. He'll send a replacement. Deepak... Shit! What the hell was I trying to do? Bloody social experiment. 'Samajik prayog'. The Hindi translation of social experiment. It's okay. It's okay. Gayatri, it's Bipin Nath. -Your neighbour. -Call the police. Call the police. Someone's in the house. Call the police! He will kill me. Please, call the police! Please, call the police, otherwise, he will come here too. Please, call the police, No one's coming here. You're safe. Absolutely safe. Don't worry. Can I get you vodka? Or maybe rum. It will warm your body. Please call the police right now. You wasted the police's time earlier. Inspector Chandel was furious. There's definitely someone in the house. I'm telling the truth. Please go and call the police first. Someone's here? Then come over here. Come on. Sit. Take a seat. Feel safe over here. Stay here tonight. Ira's here, me too. Ira. Come, child. Say hello to your sister. She is very shy. She's gone. Please call the police right now. Yes, yes, I will. It's dead. Landlines are a menace. Don't worry, I'll try the mobile. I've two phones. Gayatri. Gayatri, listen. Listen to me, Gayatri. Gayatri. Go on then. No one will believe you. Everyone thinks you're crazy! Call Deepak. -Ma'am. -Deepak. Deepak. Bipin Nath killed them. Bipin Nath killed Neel and Gautami. He was in the room upstairs. -Please, let's go to the police... -Ma'am, ma'am. There's been a landslide outside. All the roads are closed. And we can't climb up the mountain in this condition. Okay. I am here now. No one's coming. No, we can't stay here. This house isn't safe. Can we go to your house, please? -Please. -Okay, fine. Fine. Relax. Relax. Relax. Careful. The sofa's over here. You can sleep in my room. I'll sleep out here. Where are you going? Stay here. I'll go get my mattress. No one's coming. No one's coming, relax. Who is it? Who... -Deepak! -It's me, Ira. Gautami's friend... Ira Nath. What are you doing here? -Stay away from me. -Gayatri. My papa didn't kill anyone. I took the keys. You're saying this to save your father. -Stay away from me. -I felt the same way earlier, that's why I stole the keys. But the keys are not to our house. You're lying. You get nightmares, don't you? Gautami did too. He is a monster. He killed Gautami. And now he will kill you. Who? Your nurse. No. He gives you... sleeping pills, doesn't he? That's what gives you nightmares. What are you doing here? I heard some noise. There's no one here. You're absolutely safe. Come. Ma'am... Your night dose. Bring your hand forth. Deepak... washroom. Dr. Raman's said you can't miss a single dose. Wash up... while I go park the car. Take these bandages off, please. Have you lost your mind? Stay back. We'll never be able to get out otherwise. I don't want to go anywhere. Let me think. We're running out of time. Why are you here, huh? What do you want from me? Gautami was my friend. Why didn't you tell me earlier? If there is so much love for Gautami, then go to the police. Why did you come to me? Because I saw your nurse yesterday, for the second time. First time I saw him with Gautami. Believe me, please. I can't listen. Get out of here. Get out. Keep this key. Doesn't belong in my house, may fit here. And I came because, Gautami was the only one who was polite to me. For others, it didn't matter whether I even existed. What happened, ma'am? Why did you take off your bandages? Dr. Raman will be very angry. Ira... Ira was here. Ira... Bipin Nath's daughter Ira. She was saying negative things about you. And you took off your bandages. No, I wanted to see your face. How do I look? -'Excuse me. -Yes.' 'Where can I find Usha Nair,' 'who trains visually impaired people?' 'Her shift? over.' 'Try the changing room, in the basement.' I can't see. I can't see anything. Nothing. Nothing? No. Nothing at all? Now? No. The surgery was a failure, Deepak. Take me to the hospital, please. Dr. Raman will come in the morning, ma'am. Take me to some other doctor. Anyone at all. Please save my eyes, Deepak. -Please. -Ma'am. Listen to me carefully. You're beyond help now. What's done is done. Such care, such attention? Why are you doing all this? You said it's fun. Staying in the dark is not difficult. All one needs is a guide like me. I thought you didn't mean any of it. But then I thought, it must mean something. It's hard to believe if I try to believe you, and hurts if I don't. But when you kissed... I came home conflicted. But when you called me at night, I thought... you need me as much as I need you. Ma'am, soup. What happened, ma'am? Needs more salt. Can you get it? Come on, ma'am. Get up. Need to take you somewhere. -Come on. -Where? At four steps is a box on your left. Come on, open it. Open it. -What's in it? -Open it! Liar. Liar just like your sister. Leave me. -Leave me. -Are you scared? You need help. You need help. You are. But you don't know what fear is. Actual fear. Fear of getting inside a room, no one will turn around and look. The fear of asking questions, because no one will answer them. The fear of daily life. The fear of losing yourself in the hustle and bustle of the world. And then I realized... The only people capable of seeing me, are those who cannot see anything else. Only they need me. Why did you betray me, ma'am, like your sister? Darkness is necessary. For our relationship. Mrs. Solanki! Aunty! Who... who is there? Gayatri. You scared me, child. Sorry, aunty. -Are all the doors closed? -Yes. -Where is your phone? -Why? A monster infiltrated our home. Where's your phone? Don't take another step. Who is there? Who are you talking to? The monster who thinks no one can see him. He killed Gautami. I loved her. She was scared of the darkness. And also killed Neel. It was necessary. Lowlife. Call the police, aunty. Call them! Whether it's a human's child or an animal's, no one loves him more than a mother. I told you. You cannot survive without me. Will you understand my value after I am dead? I knew it the day you were born, I'll have to carry you all my life. Carry you on my back. But all you ever caused me was grief. Every time I had a new show, my dear son was sick. I quit several shows so I could attend to you. I had so many achievements to make, but what did I do? I settled down in this jungle because of you. Come, Kaalia. Anything you touch turns to dust. But the world never says that the son's useless. They always blame the mom. You didn't raise him well. If I had known, I would've killed you in my womb. Now that you're here... This is why... This is why I used to keep you locked up in the house. Well... it's okay. Put your pants and underwear in the bucket. I will wash them in the morning. Go on. Go on. Listen. And take my advice. It's not too late. We don't need anyone. We mother and son can live on our own. How long will you look after me, mom? Get some rest, mom. What are you doing? Leave me. Rest, mom. Leave me! Rest, mom. I am a grown-up now. I can decide for myself. Rest, mom. Take rest. That's it. That's it. Don't worry, ma'am. We won't need this anymore. Is the darkness coming back? This time it will stay permanently. We'll go someplace far away. We'll start from the beginning. Don't touch me! B******! Don't want to be with me? You don't? What do you want to do? Die? Die? Die? What? Come on. Die. Go on. Die. Am I that bad? Die. Die. Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die just like your sister. Die. I can't. I can't. I can't. Whether you believe it or not, but you do love me. We share a beautiful relationship. We'll keep it this way. Help! Help! Help! -'Hello.' -Sir, sir... Please listen to me, sir. Sir, don't hang up. I am calling you for the last time. Please, listen to me once. -Sir, please. -'Okay, tell me what happened?' -' What happened? Tell me.' -Sir, he's in the house. Madam, please. Sir, please listen to me. For the last time, sir. Please. -Please. -Okay. You calm down. I cannot calm down, sir. I am sorry, sir. Sir, please. Help me out this once. Sir, please. I won't call you again, sir. Please, believe me. Okay. Where are you calling from? Where are you? Sir... Hello. Hello. Gayatri. Ma'am. Look away. -Throw down the knife. -Look away or I will kill you. Throw down the knife. Look away! Look away! Look away! Look away! Throw down the knife or I will open fire. Hey! Would you like to see Neel? Neel donated his eyes. Who... got it? The one... who deserves it. 'Remember that day in Pehelgaum, when we lay on the ice' 'for hours watching the sky.' 'You were.' 'What were you watching?' 'The reflection of the sky in your eyes.' 'You wrote a few lines in tribute to my eyes.' 'Really, now?' 'Yeah, let's hear it.' "These eyes of yours, darker than the night." "It has its own ambience, own stars." "Can't trust your word, they mean nothing." "Their heart's missing, it's just hollow." "They make brag online," "but in reality, they wouldn't help a dying man ever." "Everyone by your side in your good times," "you're alone when times are bad." "Ovations are clear and loud, but my pain is unheard of." "My eyes tend to ignore," "these are my eyes, but your mind's completely blurred." "Yeah! Your mind's completely blurred." "Yeah! It's the devil's haven." "Yeah! What are you afraid of?" "I care a damn what the world says about me." "Yeah! Your mind's completely blurred." "Yeah! It's the devil's haven." "Yeah! What are you afraid of?" "I care a damn what the world says about me." "Care a damn..." "Can't tell the friends from foes. My pain is now gonna roar." "You are in for a ride now, think you can be strong enough." "I'm breaking free of these greedy relationships," "I am gonna strangle your joys with my own hands." "The conscious is pure and they are corrupt." "The ones you saved are out to loot." "They will reap what they sowed..." "It's my turn now, everyone else will be mute." "Everyone by your side in your good times," "you're alone when times are bad." "Ovations are clear and loud, but my pain is unheard of." "My eyes tend to ignore," "these are my eyes, but your mind's completely blurred." "Yeah! Your mind's completely blurred." "Yeah! It's the devil's haven." "Yeah! What are you afraid of?" "I care a damn what the world says about me." "Yeah! Your mind's completely blurred." "Yeah! It's the devil's haven." "Yeah! What are you afraid of?" "I care a damn what the world says about me."
