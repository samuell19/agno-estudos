The winner of this tournament will qualify... for the world boxing championship in Algeria next month. Ho Dong in red is up against Jiang Nan in blue now. Ho Dong is currently leading with more points than Jiang Nan. All right, we're now looking at Lee Wah in red. His spinning kick is very powerful. He can easily defeat his opponent. Wu Si Gui is up against Ma Yuen Yuen now. Wu Si Gui's signature move is his Demonic Orchid Kick... which can easily knock out an opponent. There are indeed many exciting matches in today's tournament. No wonder the scalped tickets are sold at HK$1500 each! Look! Wu Si Gui is using his Orchid Kick now! The audience here can hear the sound of his kick! Those in front of the television can feel it too! That is really lousy. His opponent seems formidable. And all of a sudden... Let me show you! There's one more piece left. It's time to give him a turning kick! How could he have missed that? That kick is more like it. Now I'm itching to show off my kick too! Where is the last piece? Ouch! I've finally found it. Somebody is here. Who are you? Try my 360 Crescent Kick! I dodge... I duck... I block... I got you! - What is your shoe size? - So they're dummy legs. Got you! Mom, that's a good kick. Why are there so many dummy legs in your house? How dare you criticise Yun Ha Gao's only grandson in front of his house? No... How dare you criticise Yun Ha Gao's only grandson... in front of his house and in front of my mother? No, there is a letter from the Royal Hong Kong Police Force. Why didn't you say so earlier? - Mom, am I transferred to the city? - We should thank our ancestors. - Offer them some incense now. - Let me take a look. Don't bother. They're transferring you to CID in Hong Kong. The letter tells you to report to Sir Wu next Monday at 10:00 am... at Guan Hei Chong Street, Room 809. It wasn't me, I didn't peek at it. Fatty read it and told me about it. It's not my fault. I know I was wrong. But what's done cannot be undone. I have to go home for dinner now. Bye-bye. Wah, you're so lucky to be transferred to Hong Kong, I'm so jealous of you! - Why? - Forget it. I don't want to be hit by your mom again. My mom only hits me. What's the matter? You're thinking of dad again? I was adopted by your grandfather when I was little and then he died. Your uncle took me in and then he died too. So your dad took me in. Wasn't that good? Grandfather and uncle took you in as their maid... but dad treated you better by making you his second wife. - That's the saddest part. - Why? Your dad passed away on the third day after we got married. I couldn't fulfil my duty as a wife. I think of him whenever I see this cannon. - Really? It was that big? - You little rascal... - You must bear this in mind. - What? Your grandfather, Yun Ha Gao, was a hero. The government built this cannon in front of the house as a memorial. You're officially a policeman now. You must uphold our family name. Bear it in mind. - All right, I will. - Fine. Good news! Wah will be transferred to CID in Hong Kong! Wah has made the family proud! He's transferred to CID in Hong Kong! - So Wah is an officer now! - Let's inform all our friends! Hello, Wah has been transferred to CID in Hong Kong. Good news! Wah will be transferred to CID in Hong Kong! It has been his dream to be transferred to Hong Kong. He will definitely come and look for me. You're wrong, I'm not looking for you. Where is master? He is... He is in the backyard, isn't he? I'll go and look for him. Master! Master! Are you doing handstand push-ups? Yes. You're doing handstand push-ups on the rooftop? That's incredible! Can you do it with only your right hand? Sure! That's really incredible! How about with only your left hand? No problem. How about not using your hands at all? - You can't, right? - I'll try. Am I dreaming? Master, can you teach me how to do that handless handstand push-up? No way... I won't teach you that. - Let's eat. - Yes, let's eat. - Daddy, do you... - No, I can take the food myself. She's asking if you want your dirty clothes to be washed. - Yes... - See? Stop trying to act smart. By the way, your cousin is coming back from America soon. Have you tidied up the room yet? Why not? Your cousin is a bright and handsome young man. You have to take good care of him in the future. He is your fiance. - What? Why didn't I know that? - Why do you have to know that? - We are childhood friends. - So what? She was arranged to marry him even before she was born. I'll go to the... She wants to go to the store. I'll go with her. No, sit down. I'll join you later. Didn't you see that? She can't even speak Chinese properly. How is she going to communicate with her cousin in English? Hold it... I know what you're thinking. You've always liked Lan, right? But just because you like her, it doesn't mean... Actually, we should be thinking about her future. If she marries her cousin, she'll have a stable and comfortable life. She would be the proprietress of a restaurant... Yun Tak Wah! Dad is calling for you. Don't bother about him. I've already told him. Ride carefully. I'll be going to Hong Kong tomorrow. Take care of yourself. Are you close with your cousin? We were close when we were three years old. - I'm going to ignore you. - I was just kidding. - Let go! Ji An, let go! - No way! - What's wrong with you, Ji An? - I wasn't focused last time. - I want to fight you again! - Fight again! I left a bruise on your face last time, and you want to fight me again? You are leaving for Hong Kong tomorrow. If I don't have a rematch with you today, I'm nothing but a chicken! Nothing but a chicken! Super Spin Kick? - At the same spot again? - Exactly. Buddy, take care when you're in Hong Kong. - Go slow... - It's not going to hit. - Go slow! - It really hit. Remember, if you face trouble, mention your grandfather's name. That's right! His name garners more respect than the Hong Kong Police. That's right! - You have to work hard. - Okay. - We have high hopes for you. - I'll take care of myself. - That's right! - You still owe me two dollars. Bring glory to our family! Bring glory to our village! - Take care! - Bye! - Uncle San... - Bye! remember to be careful when you sun-dry your salted fish next time! - Hey, hello. - Aren't you Chinese? He is so handsome! - He looks like Andy Lau. - I think he looks like Leon Lai. Come in. - Sir? - Come in. Where are you? - I've already entered the room. - Can you pass me... - What did you say? - Can you pass me... Okay... here you go. - Not this! I need toilet paper. - Hold on. Here you go. - You are Yun Tak Wah? - Yes, sir. Don't call me sir. People called me Little Sau when I was young. When I was an adult, people called me Brother Sau. And now, people call me Uncle Sau. Uncle Sau? I heard that you are from Lantau Island... I beg your pardon? I heard that you are from Lantau Island... - I really can't hear you. - I heard that... you're an outstanding policeman from Lantau Island. No, I was just doing my job. You don't have to be so humble. Anyway, when you join Team One... - Just do your best. - Okay, thanks. - Bring along your letter... - And report to Team One! Thanks, Uncle Sau. He... - Excuse me... - We're not answering! All right! I won't ask anymore! Calm down... Excuse me... Why is he like that? It's no use asking these people. I should go ask the boss. That's enough... your subordinate was in the wrong. There's no use pleading for him. - Sir Zhang... - I've not finished talking yet. You'd better not say anything before I've finished talking. Don't say that I'm not giving you face. If he does it again, even Queen Elizabeth won't be able to save him. Tell him to get ready to go to jail. Do you understand? Why are you standing there? CID 3868 Yun Tak Wah reporting to Sir Pi! Do I look like Sir Pi? You should have said so earlier! You don't look like Sir Pi. You're so young. Are you his assistant? Do I look like an old man's assistant? Of course not! Then tell me, is an old man qualified to be my assistant? Of course not! Why don't you tell him? If a CID officer reports to the wrong superior... does he even qualify to be a cop? Hey! You little rascal... You can scold me if I reported to the wrong person. Why did you take it out on an old man? What a shame that you have no respect for the elderly. My name is Zhang Yang, and you'd better remember it. Because I'll be your nightmare. What a name! Who is he? Why is he so arrogant? Just stay away from him in the future as if he has AIDS. Old man, how do I address you? - Fine, I'll call you uncle... - My name is Yee. People here call me Uncle Yee. Okay, Uncle Yee... Is my superior nasty? No, not at all. In fact, he's kind and great. But I have a feeling that my superior would bring me bad luck... and I will be transferred back to Lantau Island. - Sir Pi. - Sir Pi? Good boy... - You have the same name as him? - In fact, it's the same person. - Good boy. - Are you kidding me? What is this? A flying chicken? Hey, you! This is evidence! Don't let it run around! The place is like a chicken den! It's so dirty and messy! - Hurry up and clear everything up! - I'm already trying my best! And you! Don't ever steal again! I was hungry. - Hungry? It's just a sandwich! - All right. I can buy you one! I won't be able to save you if you do it again! Hurry up and clean up the mess! This is such a lousy and messy place. Do you have a problem with it? - You can hear what I was thinking? - Why can't I? Are you kidding me? Everybody, come here and offer incense! Offer incense? Hurry up! We finally have things to do! This place is worse than Lantau Island! Hey, come here. Hold this. Be more sincere. You brought us luck. We had nothing to do for the past few months. But you brought us work. - Go offer the incense. - Okay... Lord Guan, please forgive our past wrongdoings... Be more sincere, don't blame me if you have bad luck. Failed again? Save the trouble. - Oh no. - Stop the car. - Stop the car. - Stop the car! Stop the car! Stop the car! Uncle Sau, please don't appear in front of us so suddenly again! What a close shave! Keep the farm case on hold first. I've an important case for you to do. But you'll be assisting Team Four. Uncle Yee, give us a hand. This cell phone is a modified walkie-talkie, and here's the money. The two of you will disguise as buyers. The secret code is Seng. Sir Zhang, do you think they can do it? - When are we supposed to call him? - When we see the goods. So he wants them to be caught red-handed. Oh no, what's the secret code again? Kid, aren't you supposed to be in school? - Hello? - How many people are there? Yes, I remember it... it's on the seventh or eighth next month. Seventh or eighth. Come down and take a look if you don't believe me! Are you a moron? Don't be so stupid! Use your brain to remember it! - Stop the nonsense. - What? - How many people are there? - You're really a moron? Why are you so forgetful? Didn't I tell you it's on the seventh or eighth next month? What else do you want to ask? Nothing else? I'll call you a moron from now on then. Bye. - Do you have enough money? - Do I look like I don't? Where's Fatt? Fatt was sick this morning, so he called Wah. Wah wasn't feeling well either, so he called Wai. Wai wasn't feeling well either, so he called everyone up. He called everyone from the morning until the evening. He couldn't get anyone so he called Seng. - Seng recommended us. - So it's Seng. - Hey... - You're so stingy. Hello, boss? Long time no see! - Boss. - Boss. Let them wait. Sir Zhang. Sir Zhang. It's very dangerous down there. Should we take action now? Hey! You're risking their lives. I'll take responsibility if they die. I'm the one in charge here, don't tell me what to do. Get lost now. - You... - Wah, come on, let's go. - Where's the money? - Where's the stuff? You'll get the stuff when I get the money. You'll get the money when I get the stuff. - Pay us the money first. - Give me the stuff first. Do you know the rules? So what if I'm a green-horn? I guess we should talk about the deal another day. Fine... If you're trying to fool us, you're not getting out of here alive. I'm not paying if you don't give me the stuff. - Hey, stop trying to be funny here! - What? We're sincere but you're not! You've not even shown us the stuff yet! Look, here's the money! It's newspaper? Please don't hit me... Sir, the transmission is cut off suddenly. Could they be in trouble? Where's Wah? Sorry. I'm dead... don't kick my butt... Break it open! Arrest them! Trying to fool us? I'll kill you! Super Spin Kick! It's a gun, you moron. You like to dance? Continue dancing then! Come on! 285, 286, 287, 288... Are you okay? Did you get shot? Lift up your shirt and let me have a look. This is for you. Hero! Where were you when he did that? Come in. Excuse me, are you looking for me, sir? Yes, I've something to talk to you about. - What is it? - Wah... There's no future for you if you continue to stay in your team. I've thought about it. I'm willing to let you join our team. What's there to hesitate about? Our team solves the most number of cases in this station. My teammates are the best. So starting from tomorrow... Sir Zhang, my master in Lantau Island taught me since young... that it's important to have one's feet on the ground. One shouldn't boast about his success like you just did. That's why I don't like Zhang Yang (showing off) since young. Sorry. Please excuse me. - How was it? - How did it go? - Currying favour. - What do you mean? - He was trying to curry favour. - No way! You must be lying! I'm serious! He wanted me to join his team but I rejected him. We must never let people look down on our team, right? It's okay to make compromises once in a while. - Are you serious? - He's right too. Solving cases is the most important job of a cop, right? As long as we can protect the public, it doesn't matter who gets the credit. You're right, but I've to answer to myself too. It's okay to let others win sometimes. Just let him claim the credit. I'm fine with letting him claim the credit. - But he's too arrogant and snobbish. - That's right... Who does he think he is? Sir Zhang, what are you doing here? You can just give me a call if you need anything. Well, my teammates were rearing some white mice, but they are missing. I suspect that they were stolen. No, I didn't steal them! Why would I steal things that can't be eaten? Sir Zhang, so what do you want? I want to search this place thoroughly. If I can't find them here, then everything will be fine. What? Are you serious? You want to search this place? Do you have a problem with it? Do it! Hold it! Who gave you the permission to do that? Uncle Yee, did you forget about the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in China? The Japanese used the excuse of searching for a missing soldier... and insisted on searching for him in China. In the end, the search lasted for eight years. I don't think they will search for that long. Don't you get what I mean? - Sir Zhang, please go ahead. - Don't let him... No... I can't stand him anymore. Step aside and let me handle this. I know you are unhappy with what I said just now... so you're here to take revenge. Let's just keep it between us. If you've got the guts... put down your badge and gun and have a duel with me. - Wah, don't do this... - He won't dare to fight... Fine! I only fight with people on stage. But I'll make an exception just for you. We'll fight right here. And I won't hold back. - Hit him hard! Take him down! - Don't fight... Are you all right? Can you continue? - You can do it! - Shut up! Of course! Super Spin Kick! Fancy but powerless. Boss, you're great! Yes, we won! Are you okay? Didn't I tell you it's useless to just preach about courage? - You were over confident... - Don't take it to heart... You should just aim for his throat and his eyes! - You should poke his eyes! - Why did you move so close to him? - You should be more careful. - Don't just walk away... - I told you not to fight him. - You should improve your skill. - Hey, it's just a misunderstanding. - You should give him a hard kick... To return home in glory Where is my mom? Where is my mom? Where is my mom? Thank you... What's happening? - Congratulations... - Thank you... - Her cousin is back? - Son, you are back just in time! - Mom, I... - Come and sing with me. - Congratulations... - Thank you... The two of you are not from this village! Go away! - What's the big deal? - Let's sit here. - Sorry... - This seat is reserved. - Mom, I... - Don't say anything. Wah, you are back just in time. Lan's cousin is back and he is paying for tonight's feast. Yes... He also paid to demolish our ancestral hall. Yes... - And he's paying to build a new one. - Yes... - He is our richest relative. - Yes... - Lan is going to marry him. - Yes... Enough! Who's calling my English name? What kind of place is this? This place stinks to high hell! Luckily I was smart enough to light a cigarette before going in. Otherwise I couldn't last a minute in there. This kind of toilet is for animals! - Da Chang, this... - Shut your mouth first. And it's so dark inside! I can't see a thing! Master, is he blind? Who is he? He's so rude and disrespectful! I'm sorry, he is my disciple, Wah. He's the most outstanding young man in this village! - Mom, I... - Don't say anything. I will. My son is a cop in the Royal Hong Kong Police Force... soon-to-be Inspector, Chief Inspector... Deputy Commissioner of Police, Chief Commissioner of Police! What a mouthful of titles! So he's just a police officer! Police officers at our place... would come to collect protection money from us during festive periods. They are just a useless bunch of scumbags! What did you say? I beg your pardon, Mr Yan? This young man is cultured and courteous! He knows how to address me properly even before you introduce me to him. What a smart guy... Hey, have you seen a crayon box which can walk and talk before? There's one right in front of us. He's just like a monkey dressed in a colourful outfit. He must be a weirdo. Do you know why my father named me Yan Da Chang? That's because everything about me is bigger than normal. I've big ambitions and a broad mind. I'm kind and forgiving. I'll forgive you for your rude behaviour just now. I apologise for what I said about you just now. This man in front of you... is not only the role model of the Royal Hong Kong Police Force... he will also be the saviour of Hong Kong people in the future. He'll be the first Chinese Governor of Hong Kong after 1997... I think. Exactly! You're right! Why don't you say he will be the saviour of mankind instead? - I was just about to say that. - Shut up! I'm paying for the dinner tonight! He's just a useless and worthless policeman! - How could you say such a thing? - What a scumbag. Why couldn't I? I say such things in America every day! - How could you be so vulgar? - Do you have a problem with that? - Why is there a pile on your face? - How dare you insult me! - Fight with me if you dare! - You must be an illegitimate child! That's enough... stop it! I just want to tell everyone... I'm a disgrace. Son! Let's give a toast to our disgraced policeman! - How could you say that? - Let him be. You are... You are... I'm Wah's colleague... I'm here to apologise to Wah today. I'm Wah's step-mom. Hey, wake up! What's wrong with this guy? He got drunk after hearing that I'm Wah's mom. It seems like I need to use our family's traditional hangover remedy. Stand still! Wake up... Wake up! It doesn't work? Fine. Yun's special fly. Eat it. I love... I'm sure I can wake you up with these. Get ready! It still doesn't work? Fine. It seems like I have no choice but to use the secret recipe. Here comes the Yun's hangover wine! Ancestors, please make this work. We will apply to let you emigrate there... once Lan and I have registered for marriage. What are you waiting for? Don't worry, I'll leave you some money before I leave. That's great... You're so fortunate to have a son-in-law like me. - You know that, right? - Lan! Good night then. Your seeds. Good night! Lan, I know you are unhappy. But this is an arranged marriage by your late mother and aunt. And you know what daddy is like. You know I cannot break my promise. Arranged marriage is indeed old-fashioned... but you will have a better life over there. Daddy can't take care of you forever. Yes, I know that you and Wah are... Give me some time. Yun's traditional hangover remedy... She's asleep. Yun's traditional hangover remedy. Yun's traditional hangover remedy. Yun's traditional hangover remedy. Fate can be cruel to us... Love can be relentless! Shut up! Do you know what time it is now? - Be careful! - Be careful! - She can hear what I'm thinking? - He can hear what I'm thinking? I think I'm falling madly in love with you. You'd better give up that thought. You're not going to win my heart. I have my ways... to win over your heart. You have no chance at all. Bear in mind that... I'm a virtuous daughter-in-law of the Yun family. - And I'm still a virgin. - Really? - Of course. - Are you sure? - Sure. - That's wonderful... Your dimpled smile... is so alluring and captivating. My lonely heart is stirred... but I'm afraid my soul will be shattered if you reject my love. I don't know what I should do... in order to build a bridge to your heart. Your dimpled smile... illuminated the flowers and the moon. I hope I can be your soul mate... and we can share every moment of our lives together. I'll do anything... I have a son and he is your colleague. Wah, what's wrong? Why do you look so unhappy? - Nothing. - Is it a relationship problem? Don't ask me how I know. I can see it from your expression. Is it because of her cousin? I knew it. But it's okay. You must have courage and determination. You must go for it. Let's do our best when we get back. Everything will be fine if we can excel in our career. Let's work hard together, like father and son. I'm indebted to my parents... they protect and take care of me for their whole lives. I miss my dear parents so much. Why are you so unhappy? I fell in love with a widow who has a son. But I'm serious about her. I've even written her a love song. I'm really serious. What should I do then? Well, you must have courage and determination. You must go for it. Let's do our best when we get back. Everything will be fine if we can excel in our career. Don't worry, we'll work hard together, like father and son. No, I mean brothers, we are brothers. It's fine, it's the same anyway. What a good boy you are, Wah. Hurry up! Move! Give me the briefcase. Take it... How could you let this happen in your district? Robbing a senior police officer is a serious offence. They're obviously trying to challenge the police. Let me tell you, the robbers must be after our confidential documents. - Yes... - You've to solve this case in a month. Yes, sir. Look, we are in deep trouble this time... - Real deep trouble. - Look at how furious he is. This is a disgrace to the police force. I don't care how you do it. The team which solves this case first will... Will be in charge of the other team. That's the deal then! Lord Guan, please forgive our past wrongdoings... and let us solve this case successfully. I sincerely seek your blessing. Stop talking on the phone. Get back to work. Okay, let's continue. Uncle Yee has just finished his prayers. Do you like Bonnie as your English name? - You need an English name... - Hey you, come in here. I'm composing a love song for you. Hang on, Uncle Yee is calling for me. Sorry to keep you waiting. - It's okay, I know you are at work. - I love you so much... I know that... you don't have to keep saying it. I swear that you are the only woman I love! But too bad there's an obstacle between us. Hello? I'll give you five hundred dollars to say "not a problem" twice. Not a problem. Not a problem. It's a big problem. Don't forget about our son, Wah... Hello? Hello? - Calm down! - Let go of me! I'll kill him! - I'll kill you if you come near me! - Wah, I'm really sorry... - Calm down! - Uncle Yee, help me. - Let go of me! - Help me, I'm in trouble... This is ridiculous! You're courting his mom now! How am I going to help you? I don't care what's happening between the two of you. Solve this case first before you talk to me again! Stop following me. I might beat the hell out of you. Hey! Don't think that I don't dare to beat you because Uncle Yee said so. I'm sorry... you again? If you continue to follow me, I'll really hit you. Scumbag! Go to hell! Look at your stupid hairstyle! I hate this kind of hairstyle! I hate your pants! Grab hold of him! - Go to hell! Let's burn his hair! - No... I don't care if you are courting his mom... or if your mom is courting him. I don't want you two to keep fighting with each other. We spent a lot of effort to track this man down. He could lead us to the robbers and be a witness. I don't want you two to fight again. Is that clear and simple enough? Fine, I won't make things difficult for you. Why is he laughing? Hey! Why are you laughing? It's none of your business. But it sounds like evil laughter. You're not mad at me for courting your mom? I know how to set my personal feelings aside during work. Can you stop pretending? I'm under a lot of pressure if you do that. What should I do so that you won't be mad at me? Why don't you castrate me? How about if you hit me instead? It would make me feel better. - All right then. - Go ahead. That's not the way to do it. Can you show more sincerity? Come on, hit me harder. - Why would I want to hit you? - Please hit me. Can you wait until I've finished my work first? Come on, hit me... - If you like it so much, come with me. - You're finally willing to hit me? - You're serious? Stop it! - You said you like to be hit. I feel a bit better after hitting him. Brother Wah, cheer up. Here, take a puff. You guys were really daring to rob the police. We heard that you have something for sale. Let's not waste time. What is the price? If the price is right, I'll take everything that you have. Brother, they are not serious about it, let's go. Let me tell you frankly... we're the only ones in Hong Kong who would dare to buy it from you. What do you think? Since you are not interested at all, we'll leave now. I've not even heard of your name before, how could I trust you? You may not have heard of my name before... but you must have heard of his name. He is known as Fighter. - Yes, that's me. - All my men here are fighters too! Your fighters fight to win, while my fighter fights to lose. Forty years ago, in order to protect me... he was slashed over eight hundred times. He was only discharged from the hospital yesterday. But unfortunately, at the same place and at the same time... in order to protect me again, he was slashed over seven hundred times. But he's still able to stand here today. Yes, I'll do anything for my brother. I can even sacrifice my life. Well, they don't seem to believe us. Let's find a knife to prove it to them. Where can I get a knife? - Hey... - Leave me alone. Where's the knife? Where's the knife? Knife, where are you? Show yourself now. This should work too. It's show time, stab it for them to see. If you don't do it, we'll die here together. You're just trying to take revenge on me. It's up to you. You can refuse to do it. - Are you brave enough to do it? - Do it! - Do it now! Are you scared? - Do it! Fine, I'll do it to show my love for your mom and you. My Bonnie lies over the ocean, my Bonnie lies over the sea. My Bonnie lies over the ocean, oh, bring back my Bonnie to me. Since he showed so much sincerity, it's a deal then. Yes, USD 800,000 in cash with the serial numbers not in sequence. Bring it to the factory in two hours. Yes, don't talk so much. Wah is with them now. Where are you now? - Come and pick me up, my leg hurts. - Where are you? I'm opposite the police station. Come and pick me up, my leg is crippled, I can't walk. - You're always like this! Let's go! - Let's go... Be careful with the money. Remember to wait for my instructions before doing anything. Wah is in a dangerous situation now. The police are here! - Don't move! - It's us! Keep quiet! You're not in charge here! - Hey! This is our case... - I'm in charge here, stand aside! Move your leg. Use tear gas. We can't see anything! Retreat! Go! - Where's Wah? - The gas is killing me... Where's Wah? Son, where are you? Son, I brought the money here. Son! Boss! You're useless! You didn't even know they're police! I hate people pulling my hair! - You're not needed here. Retreat! - Yes, sir! Be careful! Uncle Yee! Uncle Yee! Uncle Yee! Uncle Yee! - Uncle Yee! - Oh my goodness! - What happened, Wah? - Uncle Yee, how are you? Kid, you have to be smart when catching criminals. What's the use of having only brute strength? You should learn from me. What are you waiting for? Do you want the old man to die? Hurry up and call the ambulance! - Shut up! - I can't hear a thing. Hang in there, you'll be fine... Shall we go now? Uncle Yee will be fine. He's strong and fit. It's all that scumbag's fault! Don't worry, Uncle Yee won't leave us behind. He'll definitely pull through this. Go away... Listen up, everyone. It's okay to cry while Uncle Yee is asleep. I always thought I was the best fighter in the world... when I was in Lantau Island. But after I came to Hong Kong, I realised how lousy I am. Now I understand that I'm just a frog in the well. Uncle Yee, I shouldn't have come to Hong Kong. It's all my fault that you got injured. - Put down the Lord Guan statue! - Hey... - Don't touch it! - Get lost! Zhang Yang, why did you tear down our room? I had an agreement with Sir Pi, and Sir Wu knows about it too. Whoever wins can take over the other person's room. We report to Uncle Yee. Don't think that you can do anything you want when he's not around! You are to report to me now. I wanted to give you a seat along the corridor at first. But since you don't like it, I'll save the trouble then. I'm warning you, tell them to stop now or I will punch you in the face! - Continue! - How dare you! - Calm down! Don't fall into his trap! - Let go of me! Try hitting me. I'll beat you to a pulp! Go back to Lantau Island and ask your master how to show off. If you don't show off, you'll get bullied easily. Let me tell you something. Starting from now, not only do I dislike showing off, I despise you. That's great. I can't help you then. Hey, take the statue. Wah has failed! What a shame. Wah has failed! He didn't say a single word after he came back... and he refused to see anyone. Shouldn't I be worried? Well, maybe he is just too stressed at work. - I think he'll be fine later. - It's no big deal that he's not talking. I don't feel like talking to my wife either when I go home. Have you tried painting your house black then? That sounds bad. Brother Wah! Uncle, I plan to marry Lan before going back to America. Why? You're asking me why? You should know. She's been behaving strangely these few days. I think she has feelings for that silly cop. But it's okay. I'm open-minded about this. I don't mind as long as I'm the first one to sleep with her! Come on, don't pull a long face. I know you peasants just want money. Let me write you a 500,000 dollar cheque now. You can do whatever you want with the money. Here you go. Wait, I almost forgot something. - Sign this. - What? Loan agreement? Do you have a problem with that? Aren't you going to repay my money? You can also work for me when you are in America to pay off your debt. You don't have to pay back in cash. After Lan marries you, I'll be your father-in-law. You want your father-in-law to work for you? F**k you! So what he's my father-in-law? I'm already giving Lan monthly allowance. You can't expect me to provide for you too! Mommy! Uncle is going to go back on his word! - Mommy! - Fine, that's enough. I'll sign. You should have just signed it without all the drama. Take it. Daddy... I won't marry him. If you don't marry him, do you expect daddy to marry him? We have to keep our promise. It's so itchy... my athlete's foot is so itchy. Tell Lan to bring me some hot water to soak my feet. Hurry up! - Daddy, don't go... - It's fine... He doesn't know how to use the charcoal stove. Can you please say something? Daddy is tired talking to you. Can you please say something? Mommy is tired talking to you. Forget about him. Auntie, choose some nice Chinese broccoli for me. If you bought bad vegetables, you can buy them again. But if a woman marries a bad husband, it will be forever. There's more than a catty here. He painted the house black. You'd better come and see him. - I'm afraid he will go crazy. - But Uncle Yee... Stop giving excuses! You'd better come soon or I'll break up with you! - Wah. - I'm fine. You... When I was still a kid... dad used to tell me that I'm special. After I grew up... everyone in the village told me I would make my family proud. Before going to Hong Kong, I believed in this fairy tale. But after I went to Hong Kong, this fairy tale was shattered. I'm not better than others, and I always make mistakes. Sometimes I really wished you had not set such high hopes on me. Perhaps I'd be happier that way. When will you stop avoiding me? I know why you are torturing yourself. But do you know you're also torturing many people who care about you? It's okay to fall down, but you must get up again. Come with me, let me show you something. These are the flowers that bloomed from the seeds that you gave me. I failed many times when I first started to plant them. But I didn't give up. I tried to turn down my cousin's marriage proposals again and again... because I promised myself... that I would be here to see the flowers blooming. The flowers have all bloomed now. You are ridiculous! Say something! Why are you so late? Look at the time now! I'm talking to you! Calm down... Look at her, she's ignoring me. She's so disobedient. She's already giving me attitude now. How could I expect her to wash dishes for me in America? She's showing me her back when I'm scolding her. She doesn't even acknowledge me. Stand still! I've not finished scolding you yet. Lift your head up when I'm speaking to you! Lan, it's time to go. Hurray! Wah and Lan are finally together! You adulterous couple! Forget it... You and your daughter conned my money! - What are you doing? - F**k you! Well done! You're great! - Go... - Bye! - Swim back to America! Bye! - Save me, Uncle! They are my friends. Uncle Yee! You're all right now? Wah... Yes, I admit I used to be too weak and soft-hearted. But from now on, I'll change for the better. And you should too! Take out your courage and determination! We must not let Zhang Yang trample all over us! Let me handle them. - Let's keep this friendly. - Watch my Prosperity Palm! - Wealth and prosperity to you! - I'll take... and I return it to you. - May you get rich and wealthy! - Great, and I return it to you. - Good luck and good health to you! - I'll take everything... - Where's my red packet? - I return it to you. - Don't run. I'll get you. - May all our wishes come true! - Let's go! - Hey, wait for me! That darn old man! What are you doing? Lord Guan, please forgive and forget our past wrongdoings. Please give us your blessing to let us become... let us become... Please give us your blessing to let us become the best CID officers! - Great! Wonderful! - Go back to your seats now. Why did you put up the Lord Guan statue without my permission? Fine, you're trying to be funny? Remove all their things. Don't move! Lord Guan statue cannot be moved! Don't forget that I'm in charge of Team One now. I know that. You're in charge of your team of tortoises... while I'm in charge of my team of dragons. - Introduce yourselves! - I'm Jackie Chan! - I'm Alain Delon. - I'm John Lone! I'm Sylvester Stallone! So you're trying to act tough now? Fine, let's see how long you can last. Hey... Zhang Yang. This way is faster. Lift up the wall and let him crawl over! - Zhang Yang, this way please! - This way please! - He's so petty. He can't take jokes. - We spent the whole night doing this. Let's pull it back. We told you to take this shortcut. Do you have so much energy that you need to take a long detour? Get lost! - Today is a happy day. - He must be fuming mad now. - Let's not be too happy yet. - Why? Zhang Yang won't let this matter rest so easily. - Why should we be scared of him? - That's right. - Would he dare to shoot us? - That's right. - He's really after our lives. - Let's fight back! - Go after them! - Let's go! Don't move! Open the door! 1949 Darn old man! You called me a darn old man? Let's force them out! - He has no more bullets. - That's right... This is indeed the heirloom of the Royal Hong Kong Police Force... The Holy Gun! Super Spin Kick! - Wah, are you okay? - Are you hurt? You're bleeding! You did it again? You're always like this! - Aren't you ashamed of yourself? - You are such a loser. You're such an annoying brat! Can't you try something new? What happened while I was away? The station is in such a mess! Sir Wu, I caught this criminal. Don't worry, everything will be fine with me around. - Sir... - No, don't say anything. And you stay out of this too. I'll talk to him personally. You have disappointed me. I know why I'm always losing to you. It's because I'm not as despicable as you. What? How could you say that? I helped you because you were not his match. But if you want to have a fair fight with me... we can do it on stage. What a scumbag. Yun Tak Wah Zhang Yang Bow. Ready. Action! This is a Taekwondo match, not a Chinese Kungfu match. This is my first warning to you. Get ready. Action! - Stop! You're disqualified! - Why? I haven't even started yet! Can you don't be such a scumbag? I know who you are, you are the cop... from the Complaints and Internal Investigations Bureau. Zhang Yang Yun Tak Wah Ladies and gentlemen, we're entering the finale... of the Twentieth Royal Hong Kong Police Force Taekwondo Tournament. The two contestants vying for the championship title... are coincidentally from the same police station. They are Zhang Yang, the Inspector of Team Four... and Yun Tak Wah, CID officer from Team One. Look... Go back first. Go and ask Yun Tak Wah if he agrees to it. No problem. Don't do it, it's too dangerous. He agreed to it. Ladies and gentlemen, there is a slight change in the tournament rules now. Inspector Zhang Yang suggested it and officer Yun Tak Wah agreed to it. So both contestants will not wear any protective gear in this match. It's so dangerous! - Don't worry, he'll be fine. - Be careful, son! - I'll be fine, I'll beat him. - That's great! The match will start now! The black team. The white team. Get ready. Ready? Action! Super Fast Spin Kick! You're great! Look at Wah... Zhang Yang, we support you! Get back onto the stage now. If not, I'll start the counting. - Are you all right? - One, two, three, four... - I'm all right. - Are you sure you can do it? - Yes, I can. - Yes, you can. Go for it! Round one has ended. Thank goodness. - Pause. Back to your corner. - Boss, you're great! Sir, let me fan you. If this goes on, I'll lose. - Yes, you'll lose... - What should I do then? What does that mean? We have to change the battle plan. Yes, we have to... Just follow the plan. Go! - What plan? - Go! - Go! - You haven't told me yet! Get up... Ready? Action! I'm going to kick you! Turn around... behind you... So is this hard and tough? You're so despicable. I'm despicable? I lost to you last time because I wasn't as despicable as you. So I'm going to be more despicable than you today! I'll see how tough you really are! Again? - Foul... - Judge... - Separate them... - Separate! You're right, we should separate... Separate... He's cheating... Uncle Yi, show me how to apply the finger move. The secret weapon is on its way. Got it! You're going to get it this time! Why didn't he step on it? Just a bit more... - Move a bit more... left... right... - Step on it... Come on, step on it! It's just about two inches more. You've to go near him and fight him. Fine, I'll take the risk. He's indeed good. He didn't fall into our trap. What should I do now? Pull it out first. I can't bear to watch it anymore... Where are you going? Please stay. It's indeed quite painful to suffer so many hits from him. You people are really... hey, don't go yet. Don't come and visit me next time. - I don't want this to happen either. - Don't come back to Lantau Island. How could you say that? - Hey, don't go... - I'm going back to sleep now. Are you scared to see women cry? Don't cry. We had high hopes on you. He's so useless. Hey... why did you go and learn to be as despicable as him? When you fight him later, don't use the kungfu moves that I taught you. Sir, don't show him any mercy. Finish him off. Go! Black team, get into your position. White team, get into your position. This is round three. Ready? Action! I'll take you down today no matter what. Me too. You're great! Darn you. Great! - It's all your evil idea! - What? You and your dirty trick! He didn't use them. Good! If I were you, I'd change my name to an Italian name, called Lorento. I don't want to be called Lorento! What an awful name. You're not my mom, why did you change my name for me? What a hero! - Hero Wah! - Hero Wah! - Hero Wah! - Hero Wah! - Hero Wah! - Hero Wah! - Hero Wah! - This is great! I told you our son... Hey, look down... What's the matter? What is it? What is that? Cheers. Yun Tak Wah's Super Fast Spin Kick Class. Please queue over here. Don't worry, I'm recovering well. You have more than two hundred new students in just one morning. So few? Hurry up! Please excuse me. - They don't do things systematically. - Son, we're going to the field now. Go ahead. Sir, she's signing up for the advanced class. Advanced class? How old are you? Five years old. Five years old? She can only go for the basic class. Hand over the fees for the basic class. Next please. - He's signing up for the basic class. - Wait, how old are you? - Four years old. - Four years old? He has double eyelids and eye bags and he's underage. Auntie, come back next time.
