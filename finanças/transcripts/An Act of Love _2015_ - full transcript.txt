The United Methodist Church is one of the largest Protestant denominations in the US, with about 8 million members. And, like the rest of the country, it is bitterly divided over gay marriage. He is the minister willing to give it all up for his son, even if it means being forced out of the priesthood of the United Methodist Church. Law changes but religion doesn't have to change. Religion has its own rules. Religion does not have to recognize same sex marriage. There are lots of forms of sin, and this isn't the only form but it's one that we've been asked to acknowledge as normative when it's not. This is our church, too. Stand your ground. This is our table. Charges have been brought against me and I will be in a church trial to determine whether or not I have violated the integrity of the church. This case has demonstrated how divided we are and what a challenging position that we're in as a church. When you performed your son's wedding, did you think that the road would end up here? This could be entitled, Lord is coming, Maranatha. Actually, I have seen a picture like that. Maranatha the Lord is coming, and then the clouds like that. I did think of becoming a minister, actually, early on, but I always thought that I couldn't just go to Bible school, just because I had an interest in this. The way I was raised and taught was that this is a calling from God. I always interpreted that to be like a booming voice from heaven and that didn't occur, so I decided to follow in my father's footsteps and become an engineer. After a couple of years, I wasn't getting anywhere. I felt like this is not really my calling. In fact, the way I described it to Brigitte at the time was like, every time I sit in class, it's like darkness. I experience darkness and I can't see myself doing this for the rest of my life. And something very incredible happened. I had a dream. And I dreamt that I was transported back in time. I saw myself as a senior in high school saying to my best friend then, I'm going to do an apprenticeship but what I would really like to do is go to Bible school. And at that moment, it was like God was standing next to me and was saying, "Who do you think put that desire into your heart?" And it was like, wow. There's my booming voice. There's my calling. I was actually not too surprised but I wasn't too thrilled. Did you think it was going to affect your life in a bad way? Yeah, I had my thoughts. About what? About you going back to school and us having kids. What do I love about the Methodist Church? Well, I'm a cradle Methodist. Generations before I was born, there were Methodists in my background on both sides of the family. So it's sort of like my mother's milk, you know? The Lord be with you. And also with you. Lift up your hearts. The United Methodist Church, for me, is a place of connectedness in the community, the beloved community of God. This denomination is broad and inclusive in its scope. It has always occupied a kind of middle ground in American culture. I love my church. My church has helped make me who I am. My church has given me the privilege to do things no one could have ever imagined a little country boy from Clinton, Louisiana ever doing. United Methodism, Methodism in general has always been steeped in a love of God and love of neighbor. It's in our DNA to be loving. I mean, conservative, centrists, liberals, you just count. United Methodists are among of the most loving, gracious, caring people on the planet. That's why you find us in soup kitchens. That's why you find us working down on the border with immigrant children. That's why you find us leading all the social efforts in most communities. It's just kind of strange that the same church that works so hard against injustice is also doing injustice with its members. After I was ordained in the United Methodist Church, I got assigned to a church in Lebanon, Pennsylvania. I think the bishop thought this German pastor would fit perfectly into the heartland of Pennsylvania Dutch country. I though I could just speak my German and I could understand the Pennsylvania German, but I was wrong. I remember when that first person walked up in my church who tried his Pennsylvania Dutch on me, he said and I said Gesundheit. I was really active in the church during my high school years, in particular. So I had served on a couple of the boards, I was active in the youth group. I played the drums in the worship team, I sang in the choir. I would even preach on youth Sundays and things like that. So not just church, but my faith was really important. And I had gone one year with my dad to an annual conference. I was always interested in law and in politics. And he thought this is, essentially, a legislative body, so you'll find it really fascinating how they vote on legislation. It just so happened, in that year, there was a debate on the floor about homosexuality. An LGBT related piece of legislation came up and there was really some tough debate around that. I'd say 80% of those who were speaking were against the issue. And there was some pretty harsh language. I remember feeling pretty down about myself because it was during a time when I was trying to figure out my sexuality. So, to me, that sent a message, really, that who I was was against church teachings. I had read this was a phase that a lot of boys regularly go through. They grow out of it. I guess, at the time, I was kind of just waiting for that phase to be over, and when that didn't happen, year after year, I really started to pray to God, just make me normal. Let this phase and I'm going through end. A lot of times, I would end up just crying myself to sleep because I was so distraught over it. I remember kids at school asking me, is your brother gay? And I had never thought about it. And I just said I don't think so. I mean, I guess he could be, but I don't know. He was withdrawn, at that time. He kind of went from school, straight up to his room and he didn't really talk. And before, we always hung out. And I thought, well, it's just being a teenager. He just needs this time by himself. I had seen a friend of mine come out to his family and his family kicked him out of the house. His mother even said to him, when I look at your face, it makes me want to throw up. It makes me so sick to my stomach. And there was always that fear that what if my parents have a problem with it and they kick me out? Where would I go? I certainly didn't want to come out and be this freak and bring shame on my family or on my local church. I had started thinking of some ways that, the easiest way, the least painful way, really, to just kill myself and end it. I had actually climbed onto the roof of the parsonage one day, because it was up about three and 1/2, four stories and honestly thought if I dove off, I would probably break my neck and die. My daughter came home from school one day, and she was very upset and crying. Tim was telling her that he thought he was gay and he was considering suicide. I felt strongly that the parents should be notified, so I told my daughter that I could go to a public phone booth and make the call from there, so that it couldn't be traced. I was in my office, it was the year 2000. I received this phone call. I said my daughter was friends with his son. He was gay and that he believed that being gay was wrong and he was suicidal. And I heard these words and they instantly transported me into this surreal place. It was almost like an out of body experience. I was like-- I couldn't think, I couldn't breathe. I was shocked. And I remember driving home to my wife, sharing it with her, and she had a similar reaction. Do I really not know my children? I would know this. I would somehow know. Both of my parents were sitting in the living room, very serious expressions on their faces. And my dad said, "Tim, can you sit down, because we have to talk to you about something really important." I thought somebody had died. Is it true? Are you gay? I had this phone conversation with this lady. I must have hesitated for quite a while, and I was going over my options in my head. I can tell them the truth or I can laugh it off and lie. And I had thought, you know what? I'm just going to tell them. We embraced him that night. And we just, and I remember there were a lot of tears. We were all in tears, all three of us. And then we said, you know, please know that we will always love you, no matter what. He had struggled all this time and I never knew about it. And he was all alone in this. It wasn't that I was gay that had upset him. It was that I felt I couldn't share with them a part of who I was. I do remember asking him why he didn't feel comfortable talking to us. And what did he say? I think was more worried about it coming out in church, for your sake. The simple wedding ceremony in this church has turned Methodist against Methodist. When Jimmy Creech defied church guidelines by administering vows to a lesbian couple. I'd been doing covenant ceremonies since 1990 and I had done 12 or 15 or more, because I believe that was a part of my ministry. Wedding ceremony was on a Sunday and, on Monday, all hell broke out of the United Methodist Church. I was aware that trials take place in the United Methodist Church, but I never knew of one in any kind of detail. I didn't know anybody who had ever gone through a trial. Creech argued the ban on homosexual unions was a guideline, not a church law. Thus, he should not be disciplined. Eight persons voting guilty, five persons voting not guilty. He was acquitted by a jury of his peers. I was extremely excited. I thought this was going to be a significant victory for the whole church. I thought this was going to set clergy free to be pastors to everyone in their congregation. Well it didn't turn out that way. In April of 1999, I conducted a wedding for Larry and Jim. The bishop had charges filed against me and a judicial process was initiated that resulted in a trial that took place in November of 1999. What I decided to do was sort of a non-violent resistance to the whole process. I decided that I would not ask for legal counsel. I wouldn't enter a plea one way or another. All I would do would be to answer the church council's questions honestly. Then, at the end, make a final statement. My hope was that I could convince the jury to not vote either way, and say to the church, this is a corrupt and invalid process that we are not going to be complicit with. It was not a shock that the verdict was guilty, but I was surprised that it was a unanimous verdict. At the end of that trial, I was no longer ordained clergy in the United Methodist Church. What had been given to me back in 1970, my ordination, had been withdrawn. The trial belongs to everyone here. This is their witness. It's their pain and it's their hope that change can take place that's really going to make it possible for the future. When I was first appointed to Zion of Iona, my second church in Lebanon, before I even got there, before I even met anybody from the church, there were already rumors flying around that I had to gay son. And that was a problem for some people. I knew that there were going to be certain cities I could go to where I was going to be more accepted, and so I really chose Boston. I met Bobby, actually, shortly thereafter. We met, actually, through my ex. It got serious pretty quickly. I would say, right after our freshman year, he and I had our first apartment in Cambridge. Marriage was something we had talked about for a while. So it was, for me, kind of a no brainer. I was actually the one who proposed to him. Tim just surprised me one day and he actually had something else planned, but he had the ring in his pocket and couldn't wait any longer. So he just kind of blurted it out while we were in his dorm room. We had talked about the option of just going to a justice of the peace, but for me, it was important to have that religious aspect to it. I remember calling my dad and saying Dad, I'm engaged. We've been talking about it a lot and both Bobby and I would really like to have you perform the ceremony. There wasn't even a hesitation. I said, absolutely, son. And I remember just feeling very joyful and honored that he would ask me. When two people love each other so much, like Tim and Bobby do, whoever says that such love cannot be? Tim and Bobby, are you ready? This is the point of no return. I, Tim, take you, Bobby-- I, Tim, take you Bobby-- To be my wedded partner. To be my wedded partner. Tim, I give you this ring. Tim, I give you this ring. As a sign of my vow. As a sign of my vow. In the name of the Father-- In the name of the Father-- And of the Son. And of the Son. And of the Holy Spirit. And of the Holy Spirit. Amen. It's a very special privilege and honor to announce Tim and Bobby, married for the very first time. It was truly a family affair and family event. It was beautiful. He has made Tim so happy and I can't imagine one of them without the other. I wish Tim and Bobby a wonderful, fabulous, long life together Of course I knew that United Methodist Church did not allow ministers to perform gay marriages. Ministers had been defrocked over this. I decided I will perform this wedding for my son, even if it meant that I was fired and lost my job, my career in the United Methodist Church. My dad called me almost six years to the date of the marriage. He said you're not going to believe it, but a complaint was filed. I just was stunned, because almost six years had gone by and we hadn't heard anything. It was so weird that it was just coming up now. The complaint was filed 26 days before the statute of limitations expired. There's a six year statute of limitations. He was trying not to get caught and, at the 11th hour, he got caught. He officiated at his son's wedding and it may cost this local minister his job. The trial of Reverend Frank Schaefer is taking place at a Methodist retreat in Chester County. Dozens of people, many from Lancaster and Lebanon counties, have come to the trial to support Frank Schaefer. It was really cool to see all the support. There were signs everywhere and banners and rainbow stoles and hundreds of people. We shall overcome. We're here to say we stand with Frank. This was my first trial ever. I had a pretty good idea what's happening in criminal court or the civil court, even, but I had no idea what to expect about this church trial. Keep in mind, this is a trial with a bishop for a judge and 13 Methodist pastors as jurors. The actual trial was set to be in a gymnasium. The church set it up to look exactly like Law and Order. It had a judge at the bench, it had a defendant's table and a prosecution table. It had a witness stand and a jury box. And it had the gallery for the spectators. What other way could you set up a church trial? I wondered if there might be a way to set it up so you could actually have a conversation? If you or I are employed and my employer tells me, I'm given a handbook, and my handbook, it says I'm not to do these things or there are consequences. Frank's given The Book of Discipline. They filed two charges. The first charge was performing a wedding of a same sex couple. And the second charge is in the Discipline as a chargeable offense, disobedience to the order of the Discipline. Knowing that he was disobeying the Discipline is undermining the covenant of the church and harmful to the body of Christ in the United Methodist Church. It's kind of a quirk of the trial system that we could acknowledge that Pastor Frank had performed that wedding and still found him not guilty of performing that wedding. We never denied that Frank did this. I really believe that a father's love for his son preempts The Book of Discipline. The Book of Discipline is a covenant that binds us together as United Methodists. It's a book that contains our doctrinal standards, that explain what it is that we believe as United Methodists. And then it contains lots of different rules and regulations about how the Church is to function. United Methodist Church, probably more than any other denomination, has this process of discernment of what is God's will for the denomination that is a very democratic process. General Conference happens every four years. It's the international gathering of United Methodists, where we vote on the polity doctrine and direction of the Church for the next four years. The Book of Discipline is the outgrowth of all these generations of General Conferences, writing laws and making adjustments and adding and subtracting. Good morning, bishop, General Conference visitors and volunteers. It's time to turn in our discussion to an issue that I know matters for many here and in our church and in our world. I was a delegate to the 1972 General Conference. And during that time is when the issue of homosexuality sort of came out. And we made a statement somewhat similar to the one that we have now, saying that heterosexuals, as well as homosexuals, are persons of sacred worth and are entitled to their human and civil rights. But when the entire thing came to the floor, from the floor there was an amendment that basically turned the meaning of everything on its head. They proposed inserting, right in the middle of that, a statement that said "the practice of homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching." And the people adopted it and we've been living with that incompatible with Christian teaching language since 1972. People are being harmed by the church, by the use of the incompatibility condemnation language. I am a lesbian and a child of God. I think people, at that time, had little idea of what fruit would be reaped from the seed that was planted in that little statement. That's led to a ban on the ordination and appointing of clergy, a ban on clergy performing marriage ceremonies or unions for same sex couples. The cumulative weight, if you're a queer person in the church, is to see that every four years, something gets worse for you. Friends, we're going to be moving toward a break. God's love is for everyone! Let's be in order, please. God's love is for everyone. Even if we have to remind the church. When they took that action about clergy could not perform holy union ceremonies, I said that one will come back to haunt us. The first phase of the trial was guilt or not guilt. And each side was only allowed one witness. Our witness was Frank. The church's witness was the complainant. Jon Boger took the stand and I don't even know how to describe it. He was very emotional, although it was a little hard to figure out what he was being emotional about. Then he started crying and I'm like, what is wrong with you? It was very embarrassing. So none of us liked him, from the start. I mean, you could hear grumbles behind me. Just. We were not impressed by him at all. Jon is in the military and is accustomed to following orders. Even orders you might not agree with or understand, you're supposed to follow them. Reverend Schaefer did baptize at least one of his children and so Jon had put a lot of trust in Frank and he felt like that trust was violated when Frank disobeyed the Discipline. He said that the Reverend's decision to officiate the marriage was both a lie and broken covenant. I didn't actually know him that well because, during my 11 years of ministry at the Iona church, I had maybe seen him about once a year. Because he was in the Navy and he never lived in Lebanon. So he was never a regular attendee. The only way I knew Jon was that we had prayed for him as part of a youth group, because he served in the military. So I was very confused as to how this affected his spiritual life. But was it knowledge that there had been multiple staff issues with his mother? Absolutely. He denied that this was a vendetta. He said it just so happened that he found out about the wedding and he was appalled and decided to file a complaint. There was no vendetta. It was just simply the straw that broke the camel's back was the marriage certificate that Frank conducted the same sex marriage for Tim. And Frank can twist it anyway he wants to, but that's the bottom line. The man that filed the complaint, a member of Schaefer's congregation, said little. What would you say to the folks that are watching out here? Sir, I have no comment. There were other issues involved besides the wedding. I felt that it was almost a minor issue compared with some of the other issues that were going on in the church. I met Frank when I was a seminary student. The church had advertised for an open position for a youth pastor. We hit it off right away. We had a lot of the same visions and hope for the community, for the church to grow. We started a second service and that was very much necessary because we had grown from about 140 in worship to over 200, and the room was just too small. The contemporary service had an incredible rock group. The traditional service was equally powerful but in a quieter way, older folks, more traditional in their background and their understanding of faith. We attracted more and more people. We had lesbian couples and gay men come and join us in our ministry. We attracted people of color. Everybody was welcome. We were homeless and that's how we got affiliated with the Iona church. There was just something about Iona that struck with me and I stayed there, especially with Pastor Frank Schaefer. He was probably the most genuine person I've ever seen. We're going to take the joy of the Lord and we're going to take that joy with us into our daily lives. We're just going to start today. We do some refreshments, so please stay a while and have some fellowship and some refreshments and see you all next week, same time, same place. People are drawn to that and that's why we grew. At one point, the second service was doing so well, the attendance started to exceed the first service. That is when we began to see some of the pain and the struggle and the attacks that this story has. I started to see a change in Frank and his message and the way he conducted himself. It would appear as if he didn't prepare for that traditional service. He was late for services. It seemed as if he would have been content to let the traditional service pretty much go by the wayside or die. It wasn't the second service saying we don't like the first service. We don't fit in. It was the first service saying we don't like all the attention the second service is getting. They really wanted the status quo of the way the church had been, for many of them, from the time that they started there as an infant. He self-taught himself how to play guitar. He kind of pretty much wanted to be a rock star type guy. I learned about the concern that some people had at the Iona church over me having a gay son. I stood in the presence of two people that literally said what is he doing wrong? Why can't he fix his kid? And so that mindset translated to, he doesn't do this right, he doesn't do that right, the service started late, his hair wasn't combed, his wife doesn't wear dresses enough. And it just snowballed. Things were really starting to pile up and there was some maybe animosity between Pastor Frank and the choir director at our church. It kind of got through the church and to the choir that Frank had requested her dismissal. That did not sit well with a whole group of people. My hypothesis is that a group forms and they're known as the concerned group. We were a concerned group. The group probably consisted of about 30 people maybe. They were about how do we get rid of this man and his family? What can we do? So the very next day, after I had this talk with the choir director, the very next day, I received a phone call from my DS. I had been accused by Jon Boger, the son of the choir director, of having had a sexual affair, in the church's bathroom, with a former male staff member of the church, and that the janitor of the church had walked in on us and seen the whole thing. Is it true? Did this happen, the DS asked me. I said absolutely not. Absolutely not. Why don't you call the janitor? I have her number right here in my cell phone. I said I don't know what you're talking about. I didn't find Frank or anybody doing anything. The previous allegation that I investigated about Frank turned out to be totally specious and without merit. But once a rumor starts, there's always lots of rumors that stay out there. And it's in the community then, too. There was an attempt to try and uncover those things. But, in defense of, Frank, it was never substantiated. Nothing was ever proven one way or the other. About three weeks after the initial accusation, there was a complaint filed against me. The complaint was about having performed Tim's same sex wedding One of the members of the church at the time, and it's no secret, Jon Boger, researched it and we found proof through the marriage certificate. This had nothing to do with homosexuality or homosexuality bashing, as the LGBT would see it or as Frank or other people at the church would see it at the time. It was about what was right with Frank, Frank presiding over Tim's same sex marriage. It was illegal. He couldn't do it. Hi, I'm Rob Renfroe, President of Good News and this is Tom Lambrecht, our vice president and general manager. Well, Good News' mission and purpose is really to help the church to maintain fidelity to scriptural Christianity. We try to keep the church centered on Christ and faithful to what God has revealed in the Bible. I think it's very important that we maintain the content of Christianity and not change or adapt the content to fit whatever whims of culture and intellect happen to be at the moment. I'm speaking to you today because I am concerned about our United Methodist Church. More and more United Methodist pastors have begun to perform same sex services. One bishop said that she thinks we want a gay free church, and nothing could be farther from the truth. What we want is the church to be open to all people, no matter our sin, no matter our desires. You are a person of sacred worth, but what you do is sin. You know, love the sinner, hate the sin? That's a kind of craziness that asks a person to live a dichotomous life. You are who you are. You are who God created you to be. So to say that it's OK that I'm gay, that I want to have sex with another woman, but it's not OK that I actually have sex with her, that makes no sense. And, even if it did, it would be cruel to say that this portion of the population should be deprived of the basic human need for love and intimacy. Our church has been taken over by the religious right and politicized the church to where we are now. This is a matter of power and control. It is to maintain the status quo and it's to deny the freedoms of a particular group of persons. It became clear to some of us that the only way change was going to happen was from the bottom up. And so we borrowed a model from the Presbyterians and decided that we would begin a network of United Methodist congregations which would publicly declare that they welcomed all persons, regardless of sexual orientation. We have a large body of people in the United Methodist Church who are committed together for full inclusion. And they're sending a message to the denomination by saying we're reconciling. In that statement, they're saying we disagree with the formal policies, we disagree with current practices that maintain a stance of exclusivity, and we are working for change. Are we really two churches, pretending to be one or are we one church that just simply cannot find a way to live together? I wish we never had to talk about this again. And if the other side would not make this their agenda, if this is not what they pushed over and over and over again, you wouldn't hear anything from us. If you go to McDonald's and buy a hamburger, you know that, no matter whether you're going to one in Alabama or Maine or California or Wisconsin, you're going to get the same hamburger everywhere. If you go into a United Methodist Church, you don't know what you're going to get, in terms of theology. So taking the witness stand, I wasn't actually sure how much I was allowed to get in. My counsels had a great idea. They said why don't we start with introducing you to the jurors, because the jurors didn't know me. Who is this person you're accusing and are considering whether he can continue to be a United Methodist minister or not? And I started to tell the story from the beginning and a very curious thing happened. I kept telling more and more about the story of my son, Tim. Tim was very sick when he was born. He had a heart lung problem. They duct just didn't close. I remember the doctor telling us, he's not going to live through the night. And I mean, that was devastating. Our faith played a really important role at that time. And I remember the whole church was praying for Tim. He survived the night and then we just visited every single day. And the only way we could touch him was through the incubator. He had an operation and it was successful. And then we could take him home for the very first time a few days after that. And that was amazing. When your little kid's like that, you bond even tighter. And he was Frank's little miracle, his whole life. And so, when he was struggling with this, of course they're going to gather around him and say it's OK. I even quoted scripture. I brought in the parable of the Good Samaritan and actually got in a defense. He admits that he did it, but he doesn't admit that he's guilty for anything by doing it. He's not guilty. And I told the jury that I could not ignore my son, who was like this man in the parable of the Good Samaritan, who was beaten up and bleeding in the street. And I couldn't pass by on the other side, like the Levite and the priest did. I had to help my son. He was hurt by the doctrine of the Church, and he asked me for help. And I couldn't refuse him. It was an act of love. I felt, for the first time in the trial, a real sense of lightness in the courtroom. It just seemed to be this acknowledgement and an embrace of a father's love for his son. I don't agree with The Book of Discipline. But, at the same time, I'll uphold it. But it was his son. And while I say I'll uphold it, my kids are four and two, but what if, by the time my children are marrying age, my daughter comes to me and says, "I'm a lesbian and I want you to officiate at my wedding?" What am I going to do? Growing up in a rather conservative evangelical environment, in my family, in my church, I definitely remember thinking that homosexuality was a sin at that point. Hey, willkommen. Come on in. This is actually the apartment that we used to live in in Germany, in Wuppertal. Dining table here. Dining table. And a sofa was over there. And the sofa was over here, right. But the palm tree did really well because of the light here. So it was a huge palm tree. And remember, one Christmas, we decorated that? Decorated the palm tree and your mother thought, what? You don't have a Christmas tree? Said that's our Christmas tree. She wasn't convinced. She didn't like it. This entire apartment building is actually owned by my mother-in-law and, at the time, my father-in-law. There's just a lot of diversity in this building. People from other countries and among them were several gay couples. They were friends with one particular guy who was super nice. That was the first time I ever talked to a gay person. And I have to say, he was really nice. And I was really intrigued by that, because I had been taught that gay people are different and it's sinful and they're going to hell and all these things I'd heard. And then so I met this guy, I was surprised by how nice he was and how close I felt to this person, just talking to him. It was like we had a connection and it really changed my life. OK, in preparation to go up the highest mountain in Germany, you've got to put on some extra clothes. I thought that because being gay was so statistically rare, my brother had used up all of the gay in our family. It would be so unlikely for two of us to be gay. First, I thought, well, I'm bisexual. I like guys too, but I just also like women. I told Kevin first. He thought I was joking around with him. I had already arrived at the conclusion that I was gay but I was holding out on telling anyone, just to be extra sure before I came out. We made this agreement to come out to our parents together, but then I ended up just telling them. She said I think I might think I might be bisexual. And we said, OK. Well, I guess you have to find that out for yourself and whatever you are, we love you. I think, in the back of my mind, I knew I was gay all along, but I just didn't want to let go of the idea of getting married to a man, having a family, living the, quote, unquote, normal life. And I realized that that was never going to happen, that I was only attracted to women. I don't even remember my coming out very well. It was such an insignificant moment. It wasn't a big deal because we really, frankly, we knew about it. He was different from other kids in the same way, really, that I was different from other kids. We wouldn't play the same. We would play more with the girls, rather than with the boys. They didn't have to say like, we love you. We still love you or anything like that. It felt like a non-issue and I think that was probably the best thing that could have happened. I was wondering, are all our kids gay? Yeah. That had began to-- We had to ask Pascal. Yeah, for a while we kind of wondered about Pascal. I kind of just hinted to them for a while, I'm not gay. He thought we, as the gay siblings, would be upset if he were not gay. Yeah, there was some pressure, right, because you have to follow the precedents of your siblings. So, yeah, I guess there was kind of a coming out of me being straight. Continuing coverage now of Reverend Frank Schaefer's trial in the United Methodist Church. Tonight, we have the verdict. Because I felt I had been able to put in a pretty good defense on my behalf, I felt optimistic about the verdict. Because I really believed I could be acquitted at this point. We had heard word that the jury had reached a verdict. We reconvened in the gymnasium, the courtroom. As the jurors were walking in, I looked over to them and I noticed that they were all avoiding eye contact with me and I knew that wasn't good news. Reverend Frank Schaefer will learn his exact penalty tomorrow. Tonight, he learned that he was convicted of breaking the rules of the United Methodist Church. And I was devastated. I thought I had prepared myself for a guilty verdict, but there's no way that you can prepare yourself for something like that. I wasn't emotionally prepared for hearing those words spoken by a representative of the entire church, telling me I had violated the order and the Discipline of the entire church. It felt horrible to be in that space. Trials are not something that we look forward to or want to have, but it is the last resort way that we have of holding people accountable to the promises that they made when they became pastors. When we have a church trial, because somebody dared to minister to a gay person or because, God forbid, somebody is gay, and we put them on trial for that, it brings to the surface the ugliness that lies beneath. I loved being a minister. Every day was packed with work that was very meaningful. But I felt more and more isolated, being an ordained minister but being in the closet. I was sad and frustrated and unhappy, personally. She was our associate pastor and was much loved and was just a wonderful pastor. I started to think coming out is something I need to do, and I need to do it here because this is a church that's already inclusive. This is a church where my coming out will not divide or upset the congregation. So I decided to come out on April 27, 2003. I know that by telling the truth about myself, I risk losing my credentials as an ordained United Methodist minister. But I have realized that not telling the whole truth about myself has been holding me back in my faith. Here I am, for this Sunday at least, and perhaps for many months to come, your openly lesbian, fully credentialed United Methodist pastor. Nobody wanted to have a trial. It was much more a matter of Bishop Weaver believing that, in his role as a bishop, he had an obligation to uphold church law as currently written The presiding Bishop, the judge, said this trial is not about The Book of Discipline. This trial is not about the Bible. The only thing that we're determining is whether Beth Stroud did violate paragraph whatever of The Book of Discipline. The verdict hinged on the question of whether I was a self-avowed practicing homosexual. It hinged on some very painful and embarrassing personal questions I was asked in the courtroom that I don't care to repeat. The report of the trial court is that the credentials of the respondent are to be withdrawn. The vote was seven to six, meeting the required vote for the penalty. There weren't really a lot of other opportunities for me after that, in the United Methodist Church. Our top story, a Lebanon County pastor convicted of violating church law could learn his punishment today. I was in a different mindset on day two than I was on day one. I have to admit, I was angry. I was angry at the church for ignoring the good ministry I had provided for more than 20 years. And when I walked into that courtroom, I was not as intimidated as I felt the first day. It's been a full day of testimony from witnesses in the sentencing phase of this trial. We wanted to present to the trial court the impact of Frank's actions, the impact on the church. Former congregation members testified about a split in the church. Honestly, to not defrock him sends a message that I think would be hurtful in the long run. William Bailey testified, quote, "The impact on my family was devastating. The impact on the congregation was devastating. People left, and left with their wallets." A lot of the testimony was dated. It wasn't even accurate. We were suffering financially when the recession happened. We were suffering financially when we began to have attacks. Some good people left because of these bullies. I do think that there were some crocodile tears. People weren't sworn in. Maybe if they were sworn in, they wouldn't be saying these things. Well, I felt the way things were handled was way out of line and over the top. But my worry was Tim. Schaefer's son Tim is here and will testify in his father's behalf. They put you in a little waiting room, and the waiting room essentially was a custodial closet. I just remember thinking, how ironic is it that I'm being put into a closet by representatives of the church, in preparation for testifying. It was very difficult to listen to Tim's testimony, because he was really sick about this whole thing. But he did so well. I was so proud of him for sharing his story in front of a hostile court. And yet he told it with so much passion and grace. There was one question in cross examination. And the question was really a clever way to bring in my divorce. Bobby and I were going through a divorce and it hadn't been finalized yet. We did keep the fact that we were separated from the media. We thought that, if people found out that we were going through a divorce, it would change the trial. The question was not asked to shame Frank or Tim in any way. The question was asked to point out the fact that, if there was a divorce, there could be another marriage and that Frank might feel like he needed to perform another wedding. The first line of defense, on either side, is to question the integrity of your witness. This was a private affair that was nobody's business. I mean, it's one thing if they want to talk to me and reprimand me, but to pull in my whole family into this, and in front of the whole world, that's an affront. During the lunch break, I sensed that I could not go through with the testimony that I had coordinated with my counsels. I was supposed to evade. I was supposed to make blanket statements. I was opposed to redirect. I wasn't able to say all that because it wasn't what I felt in my heart. What I felt in my heart was I needed to let them know where I stood. So I went into my room and I prayed. I remember saying to God, can I take the stand? What will I do if I get defrocked? What about my career? What about my paycheck? What about my family? What about health insurance? And it was in that moment when it was like God was saying consider what I have done for you. Jesus gave up everything, not just his career and his paycheck. He gave up everything. And all of the sudden, I knew what I had to do. And I got really nervous and I remember actually feeling sick to my stomach. I just wasn't sure whether the words would come out. And I had no script. And I sat in the stand and I remember looking over to my family and, behind my family, I saw all these people in rainbow colored stoles. And I remember thinking, wow, there are a lot of supporters here in this room, and somehow, I felt strength coming back into me and my confidence came back. And I heard myself say words that were just incredible. These were words that were given to me. I want you to know that, if I'm going to be United Methodist minister tomorrow, I will not discriminate against anybody based on their sexual orientation. I will not refuse ministry to them. We are treating our LGBT brothers and sisters as second class Christians. The hate speech has to stop. We are harming beloved children of God. And then I remember taking out this stole. And I said to the trial court, you know, I don't think things happen by accident. I was given this stole yesterday. I'm wearing the stole as a visible sign of my commitment to be an advocate for the LGBT community. And that I can no longer be silent, but that I have to speak. And that is all I have to say. It was really emotional. I heard some gasps behind me. I was more proud of my dad than ever before when he pulled that out and put it on. It was almost, for me, a relief and, really, like a burden off me. Counsel for the church had their moment of cross examination. I could tell that he thought that's it. He just made my case. Frank, you have been found guilty by this court. Do you repent? No, I cannot. Will you from, this day onward, promise to uphold the Discipline and never perform a gay marriage again? I cannot make that statement. And that was the end. And it was like a huge load had been lifted from my shoulders. And I was free. I didn't care, at this moment, whether they were going to defrock me. In fact, I would have rejoiced. I felt like I had done what God had sent me to do. And then Jon Boger came back to the stand and said something like, did you just hear what he just said? Did anybody in this room hear what this man just said? And I found myself smiling. All around the deliberating room, every single one said if he hadn't made that speech, they would've been more merciful. Well, the penalty phase wrapped up tonight, Janelle, and the jury came back with a very interesting decision, suspending Pastor Frank Schaefer for 30 days. He has 30 days to consider whether he will remain in the United Methodist Church and agree to uphold the entire Discipline. My first thought was wait, so they're putting this on me? We didn't want to become part of the story. We just wanted our decision to be our decision. We didn't want to be part of turning Pastor Frank into a martyr or a hero. So they loaded the weapon, they put a round in the chamber, and they said you have 30 days to decide to kill your whole career. And then we'll get back to you. And, by the way, don't perform any gay weddings over the next 30 days. It was brilliant. He gets to choose. It'll be his responsibility whether he can live within the covenant. I remember other jury members being happy and feeling like a weight had been lifted off their shoulder because they felt that the burden of the verdict wasn't on them anymore. It was on Frank. But I knew. I knew from what he said that we were forcing him to hand in his ordination credentials. And so it was us. It wasn't him. Supporters immediately flipped over their chairs and started singing in support of the Schaefer family following Tuesday night's penalty hearing. I just, I was like in a daze. I was like in a dream. And then, next thing I knew, I was grabbed. Frank, you need to do communion. You need to give us communion. This is the cup, the cup that Jesus raised at the end of the Passover meal. This is a new covenant, a new time, when everybody could come to him, to his table. And everybody could receive grace and unconditional love because of his sacrifice. Thank you, pastor. We decided we were going to take this church camp and reclaim it for Christian purposes. So it's up to me. I have 30 days. I'm here to tell you of that I will not change my mind. What I said tonight is the truth and the full truth, and so we'll see how the church is going to deal with it in 30 days. It's hard to sort of watch the whole world advance around LGBTQ inclusion and, as a church, not go along with it on some level. General Conference meets every four years and, every four years, we try earnestly, we bring these petitions and we say, please change these rules, please listen to our story, please affirm our basic humanity and the fact that God didn't make a mistake by making us gay. And they say no. What happens is, from our side, we go and we think we know that we're going to win these and the first one comes up and everybody's on pins and needles and holding your breath. And then our side wins. It's thank God. And then you see the other side's hurting, and they do some kind of demonstration or whatever. And the way that it works is that this issue comes up three or four other places and gets voted on three or four other times. And now, you know, it's like hey Tom, bam, we got a guy last time. Hold him up again. We're going to get a chance to hit him again. Boom. This is going to come up two more times. Hold him up. Boom, boom. And you know that every time these people are hurt all over again. You do not feel like you're some kind of victor. You feel like this is terrible, this is awful. I don't want to be a part of this anymore. I don't want to see people hurt any longer. Can't we find some way not to have to do this to each other over and over and over? I was at General Conference 2012. I was there with the horror of being called animals and pedophiles and people who wanted to molest children and all kinds of horrible things that were spoken on the floor of General Conference 2012. And the bishops who were leading seemed impotent to make it stop. It was really quite-- it shook people up and the homophobia in particular was really bad. So it was a very difficult General Conference. The only thing that kept it from being even worse is that, on the penultimate day, a group of LGBTQ activists and some supporters basically shut the conference down with a civil disobedience action at the altar. For us, it was important for someone to make it stop. And making it stop had to come in the form of protest. That's not unusual here in America. Making injustice stop comes in the form of protest. I understand that struggle because I have been through it, not as a gay person, but as a black person. Bishop Talbert spent three days in a jail cell with Martin Luther King in the 1960s, an experience that changed his life forever. When black people were treated the way they were, that was discrimination. It was wrong. When women were treated the way they were in the church, that was discrimination and is wrong. And when people, because of their being gay or lesbian, are treated this way, that's discrimination and it's unjust. In light of the actions taken by this General Conference, I believe that the time has come to call and invite others to join in what I'm calling an act of biblical obedience. Based on the twofold commandment of love, you shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, with all your mind, with all your soul and with all your strength, and your neighbor as yourself. This is our biblical marching order. It was an aha moment. Biblical obedience. And what do we obeying? We are obeying the love of Jesus Christ. I declare to you that the derogatory language and restrictive laws in The Book of Discipline are immoral and unjust and no longer deserve our loyalty and obedience. An unjust law is no law at all. We're tired of waiting. We're not going to accommodate this faithlessness. This is about having biblical faith. And then he gave us, essentially, his Episcopal blessing. I call on the more than 1.100 clergy to perform marriages among same sex couples, and to do so in the normal course of their pastoral duties. That was like, stick a fork in me, I'm done. That was the moment. That was the moment. And so biblical obedience is nothing more than choosing to do the right thing, no matter what. And obviously people will argue with me and say how do you know you're doing the right thing? I could be wrong. But I doubt it. I doubt it. They won. They have their four walls. They won their property. They're down to one service, which is what they always wanted. And they won in the sense that they'll never see Pastor Frank in that pulpit again. But then the Lord kind of wins, because now they'll see Pastor Frank on CNN, on the cover of a book, in a movie. The world will now see his ministry. We're only going to keep him to just Lebanon County. The Reverend Frank Schaefer. It is such an honor to be here this morning. My calendar is pretty full. For a defrocked minister, I have an awful lot of preaching to do. In fact, all of my Sundays are taken. We continue to call him Reverend because we believe his ordination stands in our midst. People want to hear me share the story and I am more than willing to do it because I think sharing my story will bring healing to the church. We've been taken into a homophobic captivity and it's been more than 40 years that these rules and that this language has been a part of our Discipline. And it has cost us. I really believe that we are at a tipping point. I believe we need to do everything in our power, as United Methodists, to take our church back. This is not about doctrine, this is not about theology. It's about the life of people. Thank you so much for your witness. It's an honor to meet you. I'm grateful for what you did for your son. We're backing you a thousand percent. It's been, actually, healing to be invited to these churches, that are open and affirming. I hadn't really seen that before. Jimmy's been like a father to me through this whole process. Beth like a sister, so thank you for your encouragement. I thought to myself, you know what? I'm not so sure that, once I get through this, that I will ever set foot into a church again. God asked me to risk it all and I did. But look how faithful God is. Because God said, I'm not finished with you. I'm not finished with Frank Schaefer. I have more to do. Frank needs to take responsibility, which, in my opinion and a lot of others, he's never done that. He's never taken responsibility. He's never said I'm sorry. I'm sorry, United Methodist Church. I'm sorry, Iona. I'm sorry for those that I've hurt. He has just simply moved on. He's the rock star now for reconciliation, I guess. What's next for you? You going to stay in Lebanon? Hell no. No, we're not going to stay in Lebanon. We've been offered a place of ministry in Santa Barbara. It's very exciting, not only because it's in sunny California and it's a great church, but because our son Kevin is there as well. I'm excited to have him there. It'll be really cool to be able to see them and go for hikes or wine tasting or whatever. I have mixed feelings, because three of our kids are still here on the east coast, so it's going to be a little hard for me. It's been 18 years in Lebanon County and we've made a lot of friends, but there's also been a lot of disappointments and very stressful times for me and my family. So I think it's time for us to move on. We'll miss you so much. We'll miss you so much. We'll come see you, I hope. Absolutely. OK. Just don't forget about us. My gosh. No, no, no, no, no. I just got this yesterday. I haven't even opened it yet. Wow. My goodness. I love it. There you go. One for you, too. How neat. That's beautiful. Some of the back story's in there, some of the dirt. The concerned group. I'm going to vomit. The concerned group. He'll always be my pastor, my pastor in my heart. You know, that's the way I think of Frank. He'll always be my pastor, wherever he is. Don't you think? Yeah. I think a lot of people think that. Yeah. When we kids, my parents would talk a lot about California, as like the place that they wanted to end up. To me, it's a beautiful, beautiful place. It's like paradise. I think we sort of deserve this, because we went through hell. And we're going to end up in paradise, at least for a while. So California here we come. Our guest is Frank Schaefer. He was defrocked in 2013 by the United Methodist Church. He was reinstated on an appeal in June of 2014, but that reinstatement is being appealed before the denomination's highest court today. This is our Supreme Court, so to speak, of the United Methodist Church. So it's a very big day. There's no appeal possible after this. This is the final word. This case is no longer about LGBT issues. The trial court's findings of guilt were not appealed and the other aspects of that issue are properly the work of General Conference. Some have suggested that this is a decision that is ultimately going to split the church. We've seen other churches go through this, too, sort of around the world. Is there really a threat here of basically two Methodist Churches emerging from this? If left to stand, the appeal decision will do harm to the church because it clearly communicates that it's OK to ignore and violate the Discipline. When Bishop Carcano invited Frank Schaefer to come to California and serve in ministry, she was essentially undermining the whole covenant of United Methodism. We simply cannot feel good about being in a church that allows its pastors to promote something that we believe to be sinful. Churches need to change from the bottom up. That's been a major focus of the work that we do, but it does need to change at the top. No people will continue to allow themselves to be discriminated against. During the long process that led up to his trial, Frank began to see all of the ways in which our church is doing harm to our gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender brothers and sisters, and decided that he could no longer remain silent in such circumstances. The future has to be our willingness to live with our differences. I'm not trying to convert all of those who are evangelicals to be progressive. They can make their witness but let me make mine too in my church. This is as much my church as it is yours. Rather than hurting each other, rather than damaging the church, why don't we set each other free to pursue what we believe God would have us do? It just may be that more work for the cause of Christ would be done if we didn't use so much of our time, our resources, our finances to fight this battle that's never going to be resolved. Thank you very much for your thoughtful and prayerful consideration of this matter and the church rests with that. I don't think I would be ready for another defrocking. But I know that I'll get through it because, if there's one thing I've learned through this whole experience, it's that if you do what is right, God is not going to let you down. And it's been incredible, the support has been incredible. So I'm not afraid of it. I know it's going to be devastating if it does indeed happen, but I'm not afraid of it. Our top story, the United Methodist Church has ruled in the case of former Lebanon County pastor Frank Schaefer. This case has gone back and forth, but the decision that was announced today is the final one and the United Methodist Church's highest court has ruled that Frank Schaefer can remain a minister in the church. The judicial council reinstated him as a clergyman. Upheld a decision to reinstate Reverend Frank Schaefer. I'm so glad it's over and done with and I'm still a reverend. He plans to continue to fight for inclusion of gays and lesbians in the church. They reinstated me as a United Methodist minister, sending a very clear signal that things are changing in the United Methodist Church. And that is my commitment, I want to continue to change things from the inside out. This afternoon, a spokeswoman for the church said the next General Conference is in 2016 and, at that time, legislation could be brought up to change their stance on homosexuality. In the past, I had really thought I should go into the ministry myself. And now those feelings are all coming back and now there's a different component. I would love to be within the Methodist Church and continue to fight for what my dad has started to fight for. Reverend Schaefer, the people who reinstated you know that this is something you might do again. Absolutely. I mean, I was very clear on that. I never made it a secret. I said I will perform another gay marriage if I'm asked to. We met on Facebook through friends. I asked him to go and have coffee with me at Starbucks and kind of went from there. John and I are very compatible. We want the same things out of life and we have the same values. So this is a keeper. John and I are engaged and my dad, the first thing that he said when I called him, after my mom had told him we were engaged, my dad said, do you have something to ask me? I haven't officially asked my dad, but he knows it's coming.
