A fire sign I'm an earth sign... We're a bad match by nature Plus, my blood type is B... I don't think I'm cut out for my job Anybody can do that work I need a job with more responsibility What? What's wrong? Are my problems boring? No, why do you say that? No reason But you're lucky You make lots of money, and your name is known in that world And you can make your opinions heard But you don't know the pain and fear people like me have Are you making fun of me? No, I'm just saying I'm jealous I'm not having it as easy as you think In any case, even if I told you, you wouldn't get it "In any case"? Basically you're looking down on me I'm not looking down on you It's not like that The fact that you think that is worse Get off your high horse Chihiro! I don't have a condom Dinnertime Aren't you gonna eat, Lee? It's getting cold What is that, lost and found? It's pretty Like a virgin Sorry... I'm the one who should say sorry... I was totally drunk!

I want you to be straight with me You don't answer my calls and you won't see me... I get it But I'm stupid, so I need to hear it directly from you I live with a friend of mine She split up with her boyfriend six months ago, but she's over it When I asked her how she got over it so quickly, she said "If I think someone's really important to me, it's tough when they're gone" "But if I think I hate the guy, it can even make me glad he's gone" That's a strange way to be I think it's... I've gotta get back to work I know I'm bothering you, but let me finish When I think of you, I don't want to hate you I want to feel I had the greatest love in the world If we just stop seeing each other, I'll start liking someone else, and I don't want to just forget you! So... Say it Chihiro... Let's break up I'm very sorry Hey What the fuck is this? I apologize, sir You better be sorry Kikuchi has touched my body...
