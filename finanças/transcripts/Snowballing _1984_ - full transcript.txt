(MultiCom Jingle) (rhythmic pounding) (clanging) (engine rumbles) (chattering) (epic electronic music) - It's gonna be nice isn't it? Oh, oh, isn't this nice? Oh, mind the row, people, please! Please, stay together now, ple... Uh, Randolph! Stop following that girl. Randolph, get your luggage. - Hey. All right, this is for the luggage. Loser gets 'em. Read 'em and weep. (laughing) - I don't know how you do it, Sanders, but I swear you figured out a way to cheat on this one. - Don't think of getting the luggage as losing a bet. Just think of it as a future profession. - (laughing) There you go. - Now the one thing I don't want is a snowball fight. No! Stop it! Please, stop it! - See a green bag anywhere? - No. Well, if there are any illegal aliens hiding down there, they probably found it and ate it. (laughs) It was crammed with potato chips, peanuts, Twinkies, and some of my other health foods. - Gee! Excuse me, excuse me. (Bonnie grunting) That's full of junk food? - Hey, it's lucky we're only staying for three days. I didn't have a bigger bag. (laughing) - Can I, uh, help you girls with your luggage? - Sure. I'm Bonnie, she's Cheryl. She's the tall one. A lotta people get us confused. - Whoa, this is mine, ma'am. I believe that that's yours over there. - Ohh, yes, I didn't see 'em take it off the bus. - This is a charter bus from Oregon, ma'am. You weren't on it. - I've been to Oregon, kid, and don't you tell me I haven't. - All I was saying is this is the Monroe High School bus. We're here for the ski tournament. - High school. That's where I met Earl, you know, the nicest boy. He's dead now, you know. - Somehow that doesn't surprise me. - (laughing) This is where the house was. Married 35 years. Earl used to like to get naked and fool around. (boisterous laughing) Did I tell you Earl's still dead? - Oh! (bakes screech) You're gonna join old Earl real soon if you don't pay attention now. - Right, I'll take her, son. Look, Emma, I have told you before about hangin' around here. This is no place for you. Dean, take her into Old Town, where she belongs. And then you get yourself back here and write some tickets. We got a payroll to meet this month. - Come on, Emma. - Do you get naked with your wife? - I'm not married. - Oh, you oughta find somebody's wife and try it. (laughing) It's great! - One catsup only and one mustard only. And two Pepsis. - Yeah, on that catsup only, throw a hotdog in that, would ya? - Hey, are you really gonna try those? - What, are you kiddin'? These are sure-fire lines, man. I've been workin' on these suckers all week. I can't miss. - Go ahead, bud. Take your best shot. - Give me your wallet. - Huh? - Sanders here, federal nookie patrol. I gotta ask you some questions regarding some illegal underwear that's been brought into the state. - Buzz off. - I guess that means the strip search is totally out of the question? - Don't worry about it, Al. She wasn't your type. She probably knows how to read. - Ah, you'll see. - Here you go, that'll be eight dollars. - For two hotdogs and Pepsis? - Hey, I don't set the prices, pal. I just work here. - At this rate we'll be outta money before we even check in. Here. - Hey guys. How 'bout a little hand? - Hey, what does it look like, pal, I got a third hand to help you out here? - I don't understand it. Why am I his friend? - The man just wins you over with his charm. - That must be it. - Stacy, make sure my friends get a real nice room, will you? - Thanks for your help. Oh, this is Bonnie. - Hi. - I'm Cheryl. - Greg Perry. I tell you, why don't you all get check in and I'll catch up with you later? - Okay. Thanks again, that was really nice of you. - No problem. You take care. - Who was that masked man? - Wasn't he a fox? - I barely noticed. (giggling) - Oh, check this. - Whoa, right across the hall from us. - What do you know, fate puts you a heartbeat away from Cheryl Lester. - Didn't I tell you? This is gonna work out. - Yeah, you just got one major hurdle: sooner or later you're gonna have to talk to the girl. - You're going after Cheryl Lester? (laughing) No way. - Hey, you guys are my friends. How about some help? You know, a little advice. - Yeah, okay. Join a monastery. - Take cold showers. - Keep your hands outta your pockets. - Do lots of pushups. - You know, it's less than six months till graduation. This is the first time I haven't been going steady since-- - Since second grade. (laughs) Poor kid. - I don't know. I'm kinda looking forward to dating different guys. - [Bonnie] Yeah, me too. - I actually thought I'd be lonely, but, that Greg's kinda cute. I'm glad I met him. See anybody you like so far? - Oh, well, uh, you know, the latest thing is for women to date younger men. So I've got my eye on this nine-year-old I spotted in the lobby. (laughs) - Bonnie, you nut. - This is all right. - This is wonderful! We got pots and pans and dishes. We could probably save a lot of money if we cook our own meals right here in the room. I'm a good cook. - He is a good cook. - No, he's an idiot. - And what's that supposed to mean? - We're at a ski resort, right? You're supposed to circulate. You use a condo for one thing. Look, the girls are here for the same reason that the guys are here. I don't know what it is, the high altitude, something in the air, not enough oxygen in the brain. Whatever it is, it makes the girls go crazy. I mean, it really makes 'em horny. - Skiing, that's what does it to 'em. - Skiing, skiers, tight ski pants over a guy's buns. Who knows? - If what you're saying is true, I'm gonna take my first skiing lesson tomorrow morning. - I swear to ya, there's something about this ski business that just drives the girls crazy. There's a girl out there now. She's seen me, she wants me, and she's gotta have me, right? So what's she gonna do? She's gonna get me. And I can see how it's gonna happen now. It'll be late at night. She can't sleep, right? (soft instrumental music) Yeah. There'll be a rush of passion. She'll know I'm across the hall. She'll get out of bed wearing hardly anything at all, right? And with my name on her lips, Gigantuar. She'll come into the hallway, come up to my door, and with a fit of passion, she'll rip the door open! - Hello, people. Hey. These condos are nice, huh? - Yeah, they're great. - Uh, what exactly can we do for you, Mr. Balaban? - Nothing, actually. - Would you like to sit down? - No, I'm still tired from sitting on the bus. I'm sure I'll sit eventually. (gasps) Pots and pans! You know, we could save a lotta money if we did our own cooking right here in the room. Now, I make a cheese puff that tastes exactly like liver. I don't know why. (gasps) (thudding) - So what's the deal? Are you lodging with us? - Everybody is four to a condo. You're the only threesome left. So here I am. - Let me see if I understand this. You're gonna be with us at night time? - Yes. Now, don't make a fuss. I'm sure you won't get in my way at all. (laughs) I want you to treat me like a pal, like in school. You know, a buddy, a chum, an amigo. Oh, I haven't played this since I was in the band in high school. I guess no time like the present. ("Mary Had A Little Lamb") - No, not with us. It can't be. He'll ruin everything. We've gotta do something. - Remember that one? - Leave it to Beav. Roy Balaban, right? Well, I figured since we're gonna be roommates, amigos, we'd call you Roy. - I guess that's all right, Alan. - No, my buds call me Al. - Around the shower room, it's the big Wazonga. - I'll just call you Al. (awkward laughing) - Roy, have you had a chance to see the view from the balcony? It's magnificent. Yeah, you really gotta check this out. - All right. - This is awesome. It'll give you a real boner, Roy. Is this incredible? Come on, let's go. - What's goin' on? - We're going downstairs to get him another room. - We can't leave him out there. He's gonna freeze to death. - Our luck isn't that good. - Doesn't look like much to me. (low electronic music) Hey, Al! Andy. - Your attention please. Would you all gather around? Come on, move up close. I just have a few announcements for our late arrivals. - Let me see if I can't get this Balaban situation straightened out. - Yeah, fine. What's going on here? - Let me welcome all of you to the Third Annual High School Ski Festival sponsored by our lodge. Now I know you're all going to have a terrific time. Now, today and tomorrow, we have the semifinals. Now that's school against school. The final round of skiing will be the following day, which is Saturday. But don't forget our big raffle which comes at the conclusion of the finals. We have some great prizes. Here they are listed right here. Some ski equipment, a beautiful gold watch, some cash, ski wardrobe, a new snow mobile, and a fabulous vacation trip to Hawaii. Yes, how about that? Now there's a big display in the resort plaza. Be sure and check it out. Of course, you can't win any of these fabulous prizes if you don't have what? A raffle ticket. So as a special for today, now that's today only, with each raffle ticket that you buy for two dollars, we are going to give you a free lift pass good for one day's skiing. - Wait a minute, the cost of the lift tickets was supposed to be a part of the room fee. - [Group] Yeah. - Oh gee, I'm sorry. You see, the ski operation is run by another company. As a matter of fact, I am picking up the difference in those lift passes out of my own pocket, okay? Now my people are going to come among you and they will sell you the raffle tickets. Remember, the more tickets you have, the better chance you have of winning one of these fabulous prizes. To all of you who are participating in the ski tournament, I wish you good luck. But most of all, listen to me now, I want you to have fun, okay? Let's have a fun time! Thanks a lot. - Andrew Pearce? - Andy. - I'm Karen Reed, reservations coordinator. Nick told me about the problem with your room. - Yeah, there's only supposed to be three to a room. - Oh, you're right, that's the way it was reserved. We seem to be having a problem with our computer. It's booked four in every room. - Yeah, it wouldn't be so bad if the fourth one was a student, but it's Mr. Balaban, our school chaperone. - (laughs) I see your problem. I'll get to work on this right away and get back to you. - Um, uh... - Karen. - Karen, do they ever let you off work? - Mm-hm. - Maybe I'll, uh, see you around. - All right. - I'm freezing. Come on. Hey, hey! It's getting cold out here. (low electronic music) (banging) Miss, young lady! Young, woman. Hey, you dumb broad! I'm out here. Hey, hey! Please, I'm begging now, please. - The best people are working on it. It looks like the computer screwed up, put four people in every room. - Yeah? Well, now they got this weird deal that we've gotta buy raffle tickets to get lift passes. - What? - And let's not forget our main problem here. We still got a 42-year-old science teacher in our room that's gonna keep us from getting any action. - You know, this vacation is getting more un-fun by the minute. - Look, why don't we get some lunch and see if we can figure out an angle on this. - All right. - Sounds good. - Let's go. (upbeat music) - Uh, M-Marilyn. Mr. Balaban up here. I'm up, uh, kids! Kids, do you see, kids, do you see me? Ah, ah, Marilyn! Marilyn, I'm your instructor. Don't you see? I'm up here. I... (screams) (thudding) - It's Mr. Balaban! - Decided to get a little fresh air, huh, Roy? - Yeah, later on we'll all go jogging, Roy. - The, the, the door. (tinkling) - Move your tips together and snowplow. That's it. Straighten out your skis but keep your knees bent and flexible. Good, good. Now you're getting it. Good, come on, Melissa. Come on, straighten out, straighten out, good. - Uh! - Oh, I'm sorry. I just came down-- - That's okay. I think I probably ran into you. - Andy Pearce. - Hi Andy, I'm Allison. What were you doing on the bunny hill with all the little rugrats, anyway? - I'm a ski instructor. - You are, really? That's great! Then you can give me a few pointers. What do you say we meet after lunch at the ski lift, and have a great afternoon? - Ski lift. - Yeah. - Yeah, I guess I could give you a couple of, uh, pointers. - That's great, just great. Well, I guess I'll se you then, okay, Andy? - Yeah. - Bye. - Yeah. - Hugh, we have been running this sweet little scam for three years without a hitch. Skimming money off of those kids and fixing that raffle so that I never have to pay off. And remember, you always got your cut every year. I never let you down. - And I never let you down. None of the ringers I ever set up to win that drawing ever spilled the beans. Now, I'll handle it, like always. - Okay, okay. I'm sorry, really. All right, now, here is the winning ticket. - Hm. - And remember, tomorrow. - I know, I know. (upbeat music) (smacking) - Hey, watch it! - I'm sorry. - Hey buddy, knock it off. - Oh, I'm sorry. (shrieks) Mr. Balaban, I'm sorry! - Oh, it's okay. It's my fault for leaving my room. My wife was right, I'll never make it alone. I'll never make it alone. Have a nice day. - Have you seen Dan yet? - No. - Huh. Hi. - Hey, I've been lookin' for you. - The snow's great today, huh? - Heh, check this. Walsh, your timing's amazing. - What do you say? How about showing me what you can do? - Oh, well, see, we were gonna meet some friends up here from school. - Well hey, come on, the fresh powder's not gonna last forever. Besides, I want you to see some of my moves. I've been over the slalom run about a thousand times. I could really use some help. - Yeah? - Yeah. Bonnie can wait for your friends. You don't mind hanging back, do you, Bon? Thanks, you're terrific. - Come on, let's go. - Bye. - No problem. I've got a lot of experience hanging back. - Hey ya, Bon. - Hi. - So, who's the powder hound with Cheryl? - Dan, don't you ever get tired of chasing girls like Cheryl around? All you guys make her a nervous wreck. Well of course, notice how relaxed I am. - Thanks anyway. - So, uh, Bonnie, you're a perceptive girl. What's with the chicks around here? None of my lines are working. - Sanders, it isn't your lines that aren't working. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. It's your personality, your brain, the way you look, the way you talk, the way you breathe. - I open a sensitive part of my life to you and this is what I get back? Hey, eat yellow snow, Bonnie! (upbeat music) - Hi. - Oh good, you're here. My friends could hardly believe it, a ski instructor of my very own. - Yeah, it is kind of hard to believe, isn't it? - Well, I guess we're ready. Let's go. All of us came up for the weekend 'cause we like meeting new friends and stuff. And we like to party. (laughs) But meeting a ski instructor, that's just too much. Normally I wouldn't do this run, it's too difficult. But with you along, it'll be okay. - Difficult? (energetic music) - It's a thrill just to be outdoors, isn't it? - More thrilling by the minute. - You know, even if a person didn't ski, the view alone is worth it. - View, huh? The view is... The view, the view is breathtaking. - You're probably bored by it. I bet you've seen it a million times. - No, this is something, this is something you never quite get used to. Let's get off here at mid-mountain. - Yeah, I suppose you're right. No point in taking me to the top where it might be dangerous, right? - My feelings exactly. - Okay. (thudding) There you are. So, how should we do this? - I was thinking, slow at first. - Don't feel you have to hold yourself back for me. - No, I won't. I tell you what. You should go down ahead of me so I can watch your style, see what level of skiing you're at. - Okay, sounds good. But don't you pass me up and make me look foolish. - That's one thing you won't have to worry about. (wind whistling) Excuse me. Where can I catch the lift going down? - Right over there. - Oh, thank you. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa! (crashing) (skiers muttering) Oh, I'm sorry. - Just get out of the way. - Whoa! (energetic music) Whoa! (screaming) (screaming) (Andy screaming) - Is that Andy? - Uh, yeah. I recognize the yell. (laughing) (Andy screaming (thudding) - Can I give you a hand Are you a new skier? - A little. - Well listen, you can't let a little spill like that get to you. You just gotta get right back up and keep going. All right. - Whoa! (energetic music) - Look at that idiot. - I think I know him. (Andy screaming) (branches snapping) (Andy screaming) - Hey big guy, what a surprise. I've never tried it on skis before. Hey, big guy, wait for me. (whacking) (groaning) (Andy screaming) (Andy screaming) (crowd chattering) - That was incredible! You're this wild man on skis. (laughs) You could have killed yourself. - Well, uh, I don't mind. - Listen, you're just too fast for me. I'm going back to my boyfriend. He's got no guts, but he's not crazy. - No, wait, I'm not crazy! I'm really a very cautious person. (crashing) - Hi. - Hi. - You know, we have racks for those over there. - I was just headed in that direction. So, uh, been selling any raffle tickets lately? - Well, no, not at the moment. We heard there was some idiot up here causing a big commotion. You wouldn't, by any chance, know who caused all of this, would you? - Uh... I'm the idiot. Yeah, I guess I'm not much of a skier. I did okay on the slopes. It was the table slalom that gave me some problems. - Well, don't feel too bad. I've lived here for two years and I still don't ski. - Really? That's great. - You're the first person in this town I've ever heard say that. Sometimes I feel like the idiot. Everything here is skiing. I guess I'm just better with numbers and that stuff. - Me too, I'm nuts about numbers. I can look at a menu, total everything up including the tax, in less than 30 seconds. - That I would have to see to believe. - Dinner tonight, eight o'clock. I'll meet you in the lobby. - They won't be able to resist me. - Ah, it's a struggle, Sanders, but somehow they seem to manage. - It's an inherited response that all women seem to possess. - At least I'm getting a response. - Hey, dude, I'm having dinner with a girl that stepped out of a dream. - Okay if we stop by at dinner and meet this girl? - Yeah, that'll be fine. I'm sure she'd like to meet both of you. - Well, one thing's for sure. The girls at the club are gonna be awesome tonight. I can feel it in my bones. - I want you to meet Grace. - Glad to see you found a live one for tonight, Roy. - No, it's for my science lecture in human anatomy. - I like my girls with a little more meat on 'em. See ya. - Behave yourself, Roy. Don't do any body we wouldn't do. - Watch out for this guy. He may try to jump your bones tonight. - You've got death breath. (upbeat music) - Your friends don't talk much, do they? - They're, uh, just tired from skiing. - That's another reason I don't ski. I like to save my energy for other things. (panting) - Bronchial condition. Happens whenever he gets horny. (coughs) Yeah, I think I better take him out for some fresh air at the club. It was really a pleasure meeting you. - It was nice meeting you. (panting) - See, it gets very bad at high altitudes. If I don't feed him a virgin at least once an hour, he goes into convulsions. (laughs) Bye now. - Sorry about that. - Do you believe her? She's gorgeous! How did Pearce land her? Ah, this is killing me. I gotta get over this. - The common cold one gets over.

Yeah, come on, let's get a beer. - Now you're talkin'. - What can I get you fellas? - A couple of draft beers. - Nothing for me, I'll have one of his. - (sighs) Boy, do I need a breather. - Oh, I know what you mean.

(gasps) Oh, I'm sick! - Hi. - Hi. - Would you like a sip? - Oh, no thanks. I'm already warmed up. - You know, I've been meaning to ask you-- - [Announcer] The women's semi-finals are about to start. All qualifying women should be on the lift now. - That's me, gotta go. - Can I help you? - No, I got it. Bye! - Good luck! (energetic music) - [Announcer] The final entry in qualifying run is Cheryl Lester, Monroe High. To be in the running tomorrow, she's going to have to com every close to or better the time made by Julie Wilson. (energetic music) - Where is she? - She probably wiped out on a turn, broke her arm, broke her leg, screwed herself on a ski pole like a teenage shish kabob, her crimson blood against the fallen snow, oh! I'm just trying to relieve the tension around here! - Oh, there she is! (crowd cheering) Ah, you made it! - Great skiing. - Oh, wonderful, so tasteful. - [Announcer] Cheryl Lester of Monroe High has won a solid spot in tomorrow's race by turning in the fastest time of the day. (Bonnie squeals) (laughing) - Nice going, Cheryl. I like the way you move. - Thanks, Greg. - [Announcer] The men's qualifying runs are about to get underway. Our first entrant on the course is Dan Walsh, also of Monroe High. Let's see if he can match his classmate's phenomenal performance this afternoon. - Woo! (energetic music) - Hey look, I'm up soon. I gotta go. Tell you what, why don't you come up with me on the lift? - Um, well, one of the guys from my school is racing right now. - That's okay, I'm sure he'll do great. Come on. - [Announcer] There he is, Dan Walsh, with an incredibly fast run. It's going to be tough for anyone to beat his time today. - All right. - All right! - Great! Oh, oh! - Hey, where's Cheryl going? - Ah, some dork hustled her off. - I gotta get these skis off. - Whoa. What's this? - Oh, oh, Al, no fondling, please. Please. - Thank goodness, alone at last. - Come on, Emma, you've gotta clear out of here. Now, I told you, I don't want you hanging around up here at the resort no more. - It won't go as fast as the UFO my friend's got. - Well, that's real nice, but right now you just hustle your fanny on outta here. - You know the last time I was at Pluto, I left my good winter shoes there. Dook it! Mm. - Emma, wait a second. Let me talk with you. - No, don't touch me, you big slug. I ain't that easy for any man. - Emma, I want you to have this raffle ticket, no charge. - You know, I bought those shoes on sale when I was visiting my kids in Florida. - This is a very lucky ticket, Emma. - It's too hot down there for winter shoes. Made my toes sweat. - And you know, one of the prizes on this raffle is a trip on a UFO. You could go back to Pluto and get those shoes. - Oh, I'd like that, Sheriff. - Course, now since I, uh, I gave you the ticket, we'll sorta have to, uh, split up the prizes, you know. - Oh, that's okay. - But you'll get the trip on the UFO and I'll take the rest of the stuff that you don't really want. - Yeah, hey. - But Emma, this has got to be our little secret. - Oh, Sheriff, I wanna go on that UFO. - Good. So you just hang on to that lucky ticket and I'll make sure you get over to that raffle drawing on Saturday. - Oh, thank you, Sheriff. UFO. - Yeah. - UFO. - [Bonnie] What's all this? - They're from Greg. Aren't they beautiful? - [Greg] Congratulations. - Thank you, that was really sweet. - And the basket of fruit's for you. - What, no chocolate? - I suppose you heard, you and I are racing tomorrow. - Who else qualified? Did Dan? - Does it matter? The point is, you and I are going to be on that hill tomorrow, showing 'em what it's all about. Right? Ah, but tonight I'm taking you to dinner and dancing. - Oh. - How's that sound? - Great. (Bonnie crunching) Ah, but what about Bonnie? Can we find her a date too? - Bonnie? Um, yeah, sure. Uh, no problem. (laughs awkwardly) Tell you, can I use your phone a second? - Sure, it's around the corner in the bedroom. - Okay, great, be right back. - You didn't have to do that. - Oh, come on, it'll be fun. - Okay. Let me just go brush my teeth, comb my hair, and iron my cellulite. (laughs) - Hey look, you owe me. Yeah. Yeah, like I said, she's a real dog, okay? But we'll go dancing and you'll just ditch her in the crowd somewhere. Yeah. Just dump her somewhere, I don't care. (sentimental piano music) - That was fast. - Okay, it's all set. I just talked to this guy, Todd, and boy, he said he was so anxious to meet you. - Oh good! - Well, I just remembered that I promised Jan and Sherry I'd go get a pizza with them tonight. Sorry you had to go to so much trouble for me. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Yeah, I gotta load up on carbohydrates. I'm feeling a little weak. - I hope your friend's not disappointed she had to cancel out. - No, no, I think he'll live. How about some champagne? - Okay. - Hey, you made it, huh? - Yeah! (laughing) Thanks. Hey, where's Cheryl? I was hoping to ask her out tonight. - It's too late, she's booked. Hey, you wanna get a pizza? Nothing cures depression quicker than a big slice of all the way. - Sure, why not. But no anchovies. - Hey, what are you, crazy? What's all the way without anchovies? - Edible. (laughing) - Hey. Hey, so what do you say we go to my place and listen to some music? - I don't like music. - Well, uh, why don't I rent a sleigh and we go for a ride? You know. ♪ Dashing through the snow ♪ - I don't ride in sleighs. The horses smell funny. - So let's go get a burger and talk about life. - I don't eat hamburgers. They're fattening. And life, is a bore. - All right. Hey listen, I'll tell you what, why don't I take you shopping and buy you anything you want? - I don't shop. I already have everything I ever want or need. - Listen, I got just the thing. Why don't you meet me in the ladies room? - The ladies room. - Yeah. You do pee, don't you? - Strike out again, Sanders? - Nah, a fowl ball. - Sorry I'm late. - That's okay, but I can't stay. Mr. Tolson wants to see me in his office. - Some kind of problem? - I don't know, but he didn't sound real happy. - Maybe he wants to give you a raise. - (laughs) Not in a million years. I better go. - I'll see you in a little bit? - Okay. - Yeah! - It's you, Roy. - Do you really think so? Nah! - Yeah. Indiana Jones was a scientist like you. I think it's the kind of fashion statement that you really need to be making right now. - Really? - It says, I'm Roy Balaban, bad ass science teacher. Nothing, not even Nazis, football coaches, assistant principals, school nurses are gonna dare stand in your way. - It is an attractive hat. - It could change your life. Indiana, Balaban. Think about it. (triumphant music) - But I'm not from Indiana. New Hampshire Balaban! Aha! - Oh, sorry! - Watch it, kid! - Let me help you get turned around there. - Look out where you're grabbing. That's my UFO ticket to Pluto. - (laughs) That looks like a raffle ticket to me. - Well, what do you know? You ever been to Pluto? - Apparently not as often as you have. Hey. - Oh, hi. Oh, I'm sorry I didn't come back and find you. I just went on a walk. - Some meeting, huh? - Yeah, some meeting. I got fired. - How come? - I don't know. I tried to talk to Tolson this morning about the overbooking problem and some billing errors I ran into, and the next thing I know, I get fired. - That doesn't make any sense. Why don't we go sit down and just talk this whole thing over from the beginning? - That's really nice of you, thanks. I could use a friend right now. (upbeat music) - Your shot. Pool season's almost over. You gonna take your shot? - See that guy she's dancing with? I'll be going against him in the finals tomorrow. He's supposed to be really hot. - Is this relaxing? Is this having a good time? This is supposed to be our senior trip! Have fun. You've got the rest of your adult life to be miserable. - Sanders, she's slipping through my fingers. Shoot, will ya? ♪ Movin' like a feather in a strong wind ♪ ♪ There's lightning deep inside me ♪ ♪ I finally found somebody I can trust in ♪ ♪ The truth is out ♪ - Well, look who's here. - Glad you decided to come. Look, I'm really hot. I think I'm gonna go to the ladies room, okay? - Okay. - I'll go with you. - No, no, you stay right here. I'll be right back. You keep Greg company. - That's what I live for. - What's your problem anyway? - Well, since you asked so nicely, I'll tell you. I happened to hear what you said on the phone in the bedroom this afternoon. - Hey, come on, look, I was kidding, okay? - Cut the bull. You know, I'm not really that bothered by it. I wasn't looking for a date. But what really does get me is guys like you pulling this phony Mr. Charm routine just to get a girl in the sack. - Well, you know something? If I were you, I wouldn't sweat it, 'cause it's a problem you're not gonna have to deal with, is it? - Oh, Greg, I really underestimated you. - Yeah? - Yeah. I thought you were just another stuck-on-yourself pretty boy, but I was wrong. You're a real first-rate jackass! - Bonnie, I thought you were waiting with Greg. - I was. It got a little crowded at the bar with Greg, me, and his ego. - Oh, Bonnie. - Cheryl, open your eyes. The guy's a jerk. - This Greg guy sounds like a real prince. - Yeah, looks like he really oozes charm. - Oh, he oozes all right, but it sure doesn't smell like charm to me. - There they are. You guys are not gonna believe what's been going on. - What's wrong with Bonnie? - That girl's got her own problems. Why do you hang out with someone like her anyway? I mean, you've got more class than that. - Bonnie and I have been friends since we were eight. What gives you the right to say anything like that? - Okay, okay, look. Come on, this whole thing's just gotten us a little upset, that's all. Let's forget it happened, okay? Okay? - Okay. - Come on, we're wasting music. Come on. - At first I thought it was a mistake with the computer or something, but when I asked Mr. Tolson about it, he told me to mind my own business. But then my friend Kate told me he does this at every high school tournament. He booked the rooms to the rafters on purpose. - Oh, and once he gets us stuck up here he thinks he can-- - He jacks up the prices on everything he controls. - What a creep! - I'm outraged. - Hey, this has been going on for three years. - Well, what are we gonna do about it? - We're not gonna take it is what we're gonna do about it. Where is this Tolson guy? - I think he's in the lobby. - Let's go. (phone ringing) You're not gonna get away with this, Mr. Tolson. - Excuse me? What was that, son? - Price gouging, ripping the kids off. - Ripping the kids off, me? Karen, you know, I'm really surprised at you, really surprised. I never would have expected you to pull off one of these disgruntled ex-employee routines. - Yeah, sure, you can fire her, but you can't fire us. We're the customers. Now, what is all this price changing business? - Oh oh, now, wait a minute. Let me explain it to you. Every year when you young people come here, things are broken, things are stolen, and a lot of you take off without paying your bill. Ah ah ah, wait, I feel the same way as you do. It's a darn shame that all of you have to suffer just because of the actions of a few rotten apples. - Mr. Tolson, I found out that this over pricing has been going on since the first tournament three years ago. - Karen, why don't you-- - Hey, you can't rip off the customers. This is America. You know, land of the free and home of Ralph Nader. - We're not gonna take it, Mr. Tolson. - Well, as your friend here just said-- - Hey, pal, the name is Al Sanders. - Well thank you. As your friend here, Al Sanders just said, this is America, and I can charge you anything I damn well please. - Yeah, but in this case we're talking about consumer fraud. - She's right. - Yeah! Wait, consumer what? - False and misleading advertising, breaking an implied contract. - Like when a room is booked at a certain price for a certain occupancy. - All right, all right. So what are you gonna do, twist my arm? - Ever heard of the Better Business Bureau? - How about the Department of Justice? - How about my cousin, Moe? - How about a petition? Or a class action suit brought about by all the high school kids he's ripped off in the last three years. - Good idea. - All right. - Yeah, we could do that to you. - Wait a minute, knock it off, all of you. And take my advice, before you decide to do anything you had better think twice, because I don't put up with this foolishness, especially from a bunch of teenage hooligans like you. Now excuse me, please. - Hooligans? What? Who are you calling a hooligan, man? - Hey, cool off, cool off. - The guy's a creep! The guy's a jerk. - Well, maybe, but there's no point in starting something. - Look, we're not gonna get anything accomplished tonight. - Andy's right. Hey, why don't we at least try to enjoy what little vacation we've got left. - Yeah. - Karen and I are gonna go to the club. You guys do what you want. - Or come with us, Bonnie. - Okay. You guys? - Nah, I think we'll just head back to the room. - Okay, see you in the morning. - Yeah, have fun. - Bye. - Bye bye. - All right. (soft instrumental music) - [Carl] Hi Colleen, how's business? - Pretty lousy, Carl. You've got all these high school kids in here for the weekend, and you know they can't afford me. - Why now, wait a minute. I think your luck is about to change. We had a couple of high-rollers come in here a little earlier this evening, and they asked about a little female companionship. Are you working? - What od you think, Carl? - Oh, I can see they are. Uh, you are. Excuse me, I'm sorry. They said if we found any working ladies we should just send them up to their room. Would you, uh, like me to get you their key? - You're a sweetheart, Carl. - Oh, come on, honey. You know I like to help everybody I can. - Four bucks for a beer, eight bucks for our hotdogs. I knew something was weird the minute we got here. - I'm so keyed up, I don't think I can sleep. - Yeah. Hey, let's get our swimsuits and hit the hot tub. There's bound to be some chicks there this time of night. - I'm up for that. - Yeah? All right, come on. - I need a room key for one of our guests. His name is Al Sanders. Would you get it for me, please? And Kris, get me the Sheriff on the phone right away, please. (chuckling) - You know, last night I was thinking about the first girl I really had a crush on. Her name was Melody Hopkins. Hi, what school do you go to? She had creamy skin and-- - The school of experience. (soft, whimsical music) - Oh, and a smile that could make your heart bleed. - (gasps) Oh no! I lost my top in the water. - Don't worry, I've got you covered. - Oh. (laughs) - Then she dumped me for a quarterback. And a guard, and a tackle, and a center. It turned out, she was a real team player. (laughs) - Helen Mirch. She was strong, assertive, yet kind. She, she had this funny hair hanging out of her nostril. (laughs) Made me laugh. She was bright, intelligent, inventive. Oh, she introduced me to so many things. She was the best science teacher a fourth grade boy ever had. That woman and my bunsen burner, made magic. (laughing) - Do you believe that guy? - What was her name, Helen Mirch? - I thought I was gonna die when he got to the bit about the nose hair. (laughing) (bluesy music) - Yoo hoo, hello, hello. - Oh, Mirch. - I understand you wanted some company tonight. - Are you an ice skater? - No, I'm Colleen. I'm your surprise package. (laughing) - Come on! No, wait a minute. No, no, please. I... (giggling) You made a mistake. - Yeah, I'd say somebody made a big mistake. - You've got it wrong. I'm a family man. I, I got a wife-- - That's fine, you can tell it to the desk clerk. Let's go. - No, wait a minute! You can't-- - Come on. - [Roy] I, I, oh, what's Tippy gonna think! - Eight horny guys in a hot tub. Hey, what's going on? - Come on. - You were right, Sheriff. She was up there just like you said. - You know, times are hard. A girl does have to make a living. - No, no, the only thing that happened is, I took out my clarinet and played a tune. - Come on. - (whimpering) No, no, I wouldn't do anything unlawful. Mr. T's my hero! - I'll catch up with you at the station. Did you see that? - Yeah, yeah. - [Hugh] I thought you said there were just a couple of kids in the room. - [Carl] I know, I forgot. That's the school teacher who was in the same room with 'em. - Well, you know, I don't mind nailing a couple of kids, but that kinda thing could back fire. - Now wait a minute, Hugh, wait a minute. We may have missed the kids but I still think they'll get our message. - Well, I don't like it. - Frankly, I don't care what you like or what you don't like. So we nailed the teacher by mistake, but it's going to work out just as well. - All right, all right. - All right. Now you get down to the station and you handle that. But don't forget, we talk in the morning before the finals. - Yeah. - Can you believe this? - Tolson was out to get us. - And he got Roy instead. - Hey, you know, we better get everybody together and scrape up some bail money. - And these are the carefree teenage years? - It was awful down there. You wouldn't believe that jail, the noise and the people. - So it was pretty rough in the joint, eh, Mr. B? - Disgusting. I wouldn't recommend it at all. - But Al said they dropped the charges. - They said it was all a mistake. - Did you get me Colleen's phone number? (laughing) - The law in this town is tough. Obviously the girl came in by mistake, but within two minutes the police broke down the door. So, no fooling around. Right, people? - Right, Mr. Balaban. - Okay. (slurping) - Where are you going, Mr. Balaban? - I thought I'd do a little shopping. I don't think I can get in trouble that way, right? - Guess not. - Sure. - Ah, Dan, Cheryl, good luck in the finals. - Hey, thanks a lot. - Thanks a lot. - Bye bye. - Are you sure about this whole thing? - There's no doubt about it. It was a set up to get Al and I. - Yeah, the cops were in on it and everything. You know, we can't let 'em get away with this. - I'm not normally a violent person but in this case, I'd feel really good about nailing their gonads to the wall personally. - Hey, I'm for it. Let's trash the rooms. Let's nuke the lodge, something subtle like that. - Ah, count me in. - Hold it. Whatever we do, let's wait until after the finals. At least Dan and Cheryl have a shot at winning this thing, right? - Yeah, that's right. - All right, so it's agreed that before we leave on the bus, we're gonna make sure Tolson bites the big one. - Yeah. - All right. - All right, yeah! (upbeat music) - Bonnie, I don't mind you coming along, but at least you can try to be a little friendly. - Look, I'm here. Let's just run the course, okay? Oh, well here comes something you don't see every day, a douche bag on skis. Excuse me. - Hey. That was good timing. For once we're alone. - She makes me so mad sometimes. - Hey, I know what you mean. That girl can really get on a person's nerves. - I just don't know why I put up with her. - Hey, you're right. Who needs friends like that anyway? A lump of lard with a mouth. - That's a little out of line, Greg. I mean, you hardly even know her. - But look, let's be thankful for that, huh? - As a matter of fact, you haven't even tried to get to know her. And those guys you fixed her up with, that was all a bunch of bull, wasn't it? She told me she heard what you said on the phone. I just didn't believe her. - Hey, come on, think about it. Why would I wanna inflict her on any of my friends anyway? And what are we arguing about? We both know the girl's a loser. - She may lack some self-confidence, but, if there's a real loser around here, it's you. Maybe someday you'll get around to learning what's really important in life, 'cause right now you sure as hell don't have a clue. - Don't you think this is getting blown a little out of proportion? - Hey, you just take your fancy ski gear, your good looks, and your American Express card and lose it in a snow drift. (adventurous music) (whip snapping) - Hey, what's up? I thought the run was that way. - Heavy winds last night built up quite a cornice. - Really? - Anybody hits that, and they're in for a big surprise and quite a spill. You just head down that way. You'll be just fine. - All right, thanks. - How's the run? - Oh, it looks good to me. It's all fresh powder. You're gonna be the first one down. - Aren't you coming? - Yeah, I just got a little binding problem here and I'll be right down. - All right. - All right. (dramatic music) (thudding) Hey, you better contact the ski medic. Some jerk-off just ran that barrier you put up. - Oh man, there's always one in the group. Hey, thanks a lot. - No problem. (upbeat music) - Hey, the ski finals are startin' soon. You comin' over? - Yeah, I gotta meet Karen and then we're gonna go together. Sanders. - Yeah? - We are gonna get Tolson. - Hey, you bet. You remember the Alamo and all that. - Sanders, the guys at the Alamo, they lost. - Oh, well screw 'em if they can't take a joke. - Let me get that for you. That's for your UFO ride, isn't it? I sure hope you win the raffle. - Oh, I'm gonna, it's my lucky number. 11, 86, oh-two. - Yeah, I believe you're right. That sure sounds like a lucky number to me. - Well, it is, see? 11, that's how many kids I have. That's when I lived on Neptune. More later on when I come here. And 86, that's how old Earl was when he, (clucks) kicked the bucket. - I guess 86 wasn't a particularly lucky number for Earl. - And two, now that's not lucky. You know why? 'Cause I got two eyes. (laughs) - And two ears. - And two arms. - And two legs. - And two noses. (laughs) - Not two noses. - You mean, this isn't the lucky number? The Sheriff promised me it was. - The Sheriff. - Well, I mean, he wants me to win so I can get on the UFO and get my winter shoes. I left 'em on the back porch at Pluto. - The Sheriff gave you that ticket and said it was lucky? - Oh yeah. Of course, we have to split it, but I get to got on the UFO and he wins the power snow sled and all that other stuff. - That's real interesting news. Can I see that ticket again please? - Get outta here, kid! I gotta knock back a couple of beers before they draw my lucky number. (laughs) - [Karen] Hi. - Hi. Dan and Al, Dan and Al were talking and they said the Sheriff was in on it. - What? - Last night, the Sheriff and Tolson were talking and they said the Sheriff knew about the whole thing with Balaban, the hooker, everything. - The Sheriff? - If I don't miss, my guess is this whole raffle drawing has been fixed. - I wouldn't put that past Tolson. - Well, with any luck we've got just enough time to unfix it, but I'm gonna need your help. - The guy fired me, remember? - Come on. (engine humming) - What happened? - Up on the mountain, our friend Greg took me down the wrong way and I bought the farm in a drift. - You're supposed to go against him in the finals! How bad's the leg? - I pulled something. I don't think I can ski today. - Between Cheryl and the finals, this guy's dumpin' all over you. - Don't remind me. - Are you okay, Dan? - Ah, I think I wracked up my knee. - He's not gonna be able to race in the finals. - You gotta get to the finish line and create a diversion. Dan, when you get up to the starting line, stall as long as possible. If the men's finals start on time, it's not gonna give Karen and I the time that we need. - Okay. - What's goin' on? - I got a plan, a wild-ass idea on how to get back at Tolson. And if I'm right, it's gonna be beautiful! - All right. - Well, great. What's the plan? - It looks like the Sheriff and Tolson have this raffle rigged, and I think I know the winning number. - But there's not a lotta time because the girls' finals are starting any minute. - Oh, wait a minute. If I tell the officials I can't ski, they might cancel the race. - Hey, man, do anything you can. Stall as long as possible. We need time, okay? - All right, well I'm on my way up to the finish line. - All right. We'll see you later. - See you up there. - [Announcer] Starting women's finals, Cheryl Lester of Monroe High School against Julie Wilson of Kandenis High for the championship. The women are in the starting gates. Five, four, three, two, one. (buzzing) (energetic music) Racers are head to head, a furious downhill competition. The winner of the women's finals, Cheryl Lester of Monroe High. (crowd cheering) - Cheryl! (squealing) You were great! Woo hoo! - Oh! - Hey listen, I'm really sorry about the way I've been acting lately. - Bonnie, it's okay. You were right. He's a jerk and I should've seen it right away. - No, I don't just mean this thing with Greg. I mean, I've been a real pain, complaining all the time. It hasn't made your life much fun. - Bonnie-- - I have to stop depending on you to make my life wonderful. - Bonnie-- - I have to do it myself. Listen, I figured something out. I'm not doomed to be a plain, awkward chubette forever. I mean, I've got a lot of things going for me, and if I can just learn to use them instead of worrying about what I'm not, I can be terrific too! - Ooh. Oh, I love you! - All right, Cheryl! You done good. You didn't fall down once. - Ah, thanks! (laughing) - Hey, listen, girls, your high school's in dire need of your patriotic services. - [Both] What? (laughing) - We've come up with this little plan and we need your help. - Ooh. - Sure. - Okay? - Yeah. - Look, I'm sorry you got wracked up, but that doesn't change the rules. - I was representing the school, not myself. Why can't another person from Monroe High just take my place? - That's not the way the rules are set up. We can't allow substitutes. It's a forfeit. And that gives Hudson High the top point total for the tournament. - Ha ha, that means I win! Tough luck, guy. - Hey, wait a minute. Just give me enough time to borrow some skis, okay? Okay? - What did I tell you? Everybody's at the race. - Shall we? - Office is that way. (suspenseful music) - Oh, people, watch out for that big snowball down there. Okay, okay. Don't say I didn't warn ya. - What's Dan doing? - I don't know. He said he couldn't ski on that leg. - [Announcer] Before we begin, let's give a nice warm welcome and thanks to Mr. Carl Tolson, sponsor of this year's event. (cheering) - Please, please, no, no, no. Thank you, thank you, but let me thank all of you wonderful young people who have participated and made our tournament such a success. We thank you. But remember, don't forget to stick around at the conclusion of the final race for the moment I know you've all been waiting for, the drawing of our big raffle. (applause) (cheering) - If he only knew. (suspenseful music) - Sheriff, Sheriff. - Yeah, what is it? - A couple of kids are messing around in the hotel offices. They're back in the print shop. - Hold 'em. I'll take care of it after the drawing. - What's going on? - Everything's under control, Carl. The deputy's handling it. (Karen gasps) (energetic music) (smacking) (grunting) - Pardon me. Say, could you tell me where the high school finals are? - Straight ahead, you can't miss it. - Oh, thanks. Oh! Watch out for a big snow ball. Aah! (energetic music) (shrieking) - Ooh! (engine humming) Stop! - [Announcer] The men's finals, Dan Walsh of Monroe High against Greg Perry of Grove High for the men's title. If Dan takes this race, Monroe High will win the school championship. (screaming) (energetic music) - Look! - Mr. Balaban, look out! (shrieking) (rhythmic pounding) - [Announcer] And we're ready. Five, four, three, two, one. (buzzing) (epic music) Greg has jumped down to an early lead. Greg is out in front. (engine humming) And Dan is closing the gap on Greg Perry. (thudding) - Crowd's too tall. Okay if I stand on you to watch the end of the race? (obnoxious laughing) - Get off me, you dumb broad! - [Emma] Yeah, come on! - Hey, let's split up. It'll be faster. - Come on, Dan! - Go Danny! - You can do it! (epic music) - [Announcer] Dan Walsh and Greg Perry are head to head, closing on the finish line. - Go boys, get it. Come on, kids! (laughing) - (squealing) Go Dan, go! - [Announcer] Dan Walsh has won the Mays Championship and Monroe High is the undisputed champions. Congratulations to the winners and thanks to all of you who competed and made this year's event the greatest ever. - You did it, you did it! Woo hoo! You did it, you were great! - We'll be honoring our two race champions and the winning high school in just a moment. But first, the drawing for our big raffle, the moment when we find out which one of you wins all those fabulous prizes that you saw out in the resort plaza. So here we go. And to do the drawing right now is our respected Sheriff, Mr. Hugh Gilliam. Hugh. - Thank you very much. All right, let me give it a spin. There we go. There we go. There we go. - Here it is, the winning number. 11, 86, zero two. (crowd shouting) Hold it now, hold it. There is only one winner, so you're not looking close enough at those numbers. I will repeat the number. Look closely. We have just one winner. And I'll repeat it and we'll find out who that winner is. 11. - [Crowd] 11. - 86. - [Crowd] 86. - Zero two. (crowd cheering) What the hell's going on? I thought you told me you gave that winning ticket to the old lady. - I did! - Well, then how the hell did everybody else get a winning ticket? - I don't know. - Well, Mr. Tolson, it looks like everybody won. - Karen-- - You! - Time to pay up, pal. - No way, young lady, no way. - So long, sucker. (shrieks) (energetic music) - Well, Mr. Tolson, are you going to pay up now? - You won't get away with this. I'll have you arrested. - It looks like it's snowmobiles and trips to Hawaii for everyone, Tolson, and we know you can afford it. - You can't prove a thing, right, Sheriff? - That's right. - Ha! - Excuse me, excuse me, Charleston News, excuse me. - But I think that Channel Two News might be very interested in hearing all about this little story. - So, what happens now? It looks as though a lot of people have winning tickets here today, huh? (crowd shouting) - Oh, well, this will be my little gift to all these wonderful young people. (Hugh groaning) Oh, sure, of course. Everyone, naturally, who has a winning ticket, will get all of those prizes. (crowd cheering) - Oh, bullshit! There's not enough room on that UFO for all these people. - Yeah! (squealing) (laughs nervously) - Hey, I wanna apologize for what I did earlier. I'm pretty good, and you beat me on a bum leg and borrowed skis. You're a hell of a skier. I guess I'm not such hot stuff after all. Friends? - Sure. I appreciate it. - You know, I've been meaning to ask you something for a long time. - Huh? - I was wondering why you never asked me out. - No, me? Ask you out? - I've been waiting for you to ask me out since fifth grade. I just never thought you were interested. - Guess what? I'm interested.
