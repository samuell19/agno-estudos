Forgive me father for I have sinned. Sarah... It's the third time this week. You don't have to, you know. Sister Louise said I had to. Tell her you come to me more than enough. OK, I'm listening. It's because of the new girl, Marjorie. It's not the same ever since her arrival. Yesterday, she came with a photo of her Mommy. Everybody said her Mommy was really, really beautiful. Sarah... So, I took a newspaper the headmistress was reading. I took a page on which there was a really beautiful lady. I cut the picture out, put it in a frame, and I showed it to all the girls... But, I did say it was my Mommy. But, Sarah... Except that Marjorie said it was a fake. She told everybody... Does Marjorie know all the mothers? Come on, Sarah... Then, they all wanted to see a photo of my father... I said I didn't have any, that he was dead. God doesn't like people lying. And stop coming to confession every day. But I'm all alone. - You're not alone, Sarah! Why don't I have a Dad... or a Mom? There are answers to all questions. You'll understand when you grow up. Three Paters and two Ave Marias. But... A BAG OF FLOUR Can I have another blank piece of paper, please. Here you are, Sarah. - Thank you. Hello, Sister. Sit down. Sarah... can you follow me, please. Come along. Hello Sarah. I'm your Dad. This is Fadela. We just got married. Hello Sarah. Your daddy told me a lot about you. Your father is here because he wants to take you to Paris. Sarah... look. Can you put it round my neck, please? Come on darling, hurry up. Go and sit down. What are you reading? - A book by the Countess of SÃ©gur. Close that book, my dear. You've already read enough. It can give you a headache. Give her something so that she doesn't get ill. Here you are, Sarah. OK, she's asleep now. Are you sure of what you're doing? - It's my duty. It's the least I can do. Where are we? - In Paris. You were sleeping so I let you sleep. We're going back to Belgium, OK? It sounds like Spanish. It's a shortcut. A shortcut? Take this. 1395... How's the taxi driving? - It's OK. Come here! Don't be scared! Maybe she wants to go out. - Let her play with the others. Sister Louise!... Sister Louise!... Don't ever do that again, all right! This is not Belgium. Belgium won't bring you up. Take that chain off! You're a Muslim. It's for your own good you're with my family! Leave her alone. I'll take care of her. Like Marilyn. What if she doesn't like it here? What if she doesn't get used to it here? My Lord, I want to see Sister Louise, Maria, Isabelle again. I promise I'll never be bad with Marjorie ever again. Help me, Oh, my God... Goodbye. May God bring you home safely. Goodbye. May God bring you home safely. Drive safely. May God bring him home safely and then bring him back to us. Daaad! He has to leave for his job. Come my Lord, I beg of you. I know you can't show yourself... Come in my dream and tell me you are there. Tell me you exist. Is that possible? Show yourself! Will it change anything for you? I want my Mommy! May God be with you. I want my Mommy! Quiet, quiet... Sleep, little girl. Halima! Halima! Come along. Yasmine. What do you want? Come along. Did your brother send me money? Come along. Did he send me money? Quick! Sarah, come here! Come along. It's your daughter, Sarah. It's your mother. She wants to see you. Talk to her. I don't have any money. There's no flour, no money this year. What am I going to do? Help me. Give me something. Talk to her. One, two... three, four... five... six... It's really hot out here! Six toes! Why are you making fun of me? Quickly! And come back right after school! Do you understand? OK, now go. Hello. - Hello. Is she the Belgian girl? Hello, Miss. My name is Ramona. What's yours? Sarah - Sarah. She's lucky, that one. She got married young. Her husband is well off. They have electricity and everything. Girls! The break is over! Hurry up! Come on! Hurry up! So, your name is Sarah? Yes. In each room, a different lesson. Embroidery, crochet, sewing, and knitting. What about history, geography, mathematics? Let's start with knitting. Let me show you. Knit one, purl one, knit one, purl one. Knit one... purl one... Sarah. Come on, Ramona is waiting for us! I'm coming. I'm coming! OK. Come on! Sarah, that sweater is too big! Hello. Excuse me, I'm in a bit of a hurry. This woman is my neighbour's sister. She's looking for a wife for her son. He's really handsome! Is he handsome? - Yes, he is! Did you see him? - No. Why? - He's rich. How do you know? - He's in Casablanca. Asma, she was a girl in my class. According to what she told me when they met last summer, they fell in love. She, she thought... so, she let herself go... Poor thing! She thought Isham was going to marry her. So, she... Son of a... - Bastard! And then? She wasn't a virgin anymore. Isham's family didn't want him to marry her. What became of her? Only God knows. Look! Look! They're looking at me! The girl who is going to marry my son will be very lucky. He wants to be an engineer like his father, right? An engineer, that's right. He's looking for a wife. Isham, why doesn't he marry Asma? What are you talking about? I'm talking about Asma. Wasn't your son in love with her? You have no manners! It's not fair to say that, she's young, she doesn't know. This girl has no manners. Aren't you ashamed? Shame on you! Forgive her, she's still so young! Young? My daughter's younger. She doesn't say that kind of thing. Shame on you. Bring your daughter up. You should be ashamed! How many clients today? - There's not much work. Sarah... go and empty it. Your brother hasn't sent any money. Be patient, he'll end up sending something. Darling, I am patient but... Wait for me here. The inhabitants are feeling the impacts of price raises and a new tax to go from Nador to Melilla Hello. - ...of 100 dirhams for pedestrians My brother! - ...and 500 dirhams for vehicles. It's Yasmine! Your sister. - While smuggling is part of the market, Did you forget all about me? ...this new tax raises great discontent. It's OK. How are you? Be patient. You'll find something. How do you want me to manage? I don't have any money. She is your daughter, remember! Do you want to talk to her? You're right. Calling is expensive! Goodbye. Thank you. Someone's proposed to me again. Who is it? - Sidi Yacoubi. Poor man. His wife died. And he's left with two kids. It's quite normal, you're almost 20. I want a husband who'll take me to Europe. I want kids with him and come here just for the holidays. I just need a little patience. That's all. Grandmother, I need some soap! You have soap. Don't you have enough with this one? You're good for nothing! Come along, Yacine! What's your dream, Sarah? Talk to my mother. But remember, you did see her! I was too young and I didn't speak Arabic. So, that's your dream? Really? As well as... writing stories. What about marriage? - I'm not interested. That's it! You just want to write stories? No, go back to Belgium, have a degree. Caring for your house, your kids, your husband... isn't that enough? Studies are for boys. Or girls from big families, rich families. Because we have to go far away to a big city to find a school! Here you are. There's one over there. Over there! Where? Where? Girls, it's none of our business! All right? Come on, evacuate the roof. They saw me come in! Girls! It's the army! Open up! What's up? You'll only find girls here. You didn't see anyone? Don't move, it's the army. Get out! What are you doing here? - I'm looking for a hoodlum. You're the hoodlum. Get out of here. You're a rascal, a thief! Everybody saw you come in our house! You should be ashamed! That really was a lucky escape. Put your shoes back on and leave! Goodbye. You shouldn't look at the boy like that! All right? Malika? Don't tell me they've taken your son. Don't listen. It's none of our business. That's enough, Sarah. Nari's coming, Nari's coming! He's coming closer! Let's talk to him now! - You talk to him! Please, Sarah. Please. Nari! Nari! Above your head! Look down! Do you want to put shame on us? We finish at two! Can we meet? As you please. OK, forget it! - No, OK 2 PM. Sheherazade Cafe. Where is that? Ramona knows! Hang out the washing correctly and come down! All right! - What are you doing? Hello, Beauties! Go and sit with him and speak for me! We'll wait here. Do sit down. So? Why are we here? Wait, you brought us here. Are you shocked? - Me? Ever been in a cafe? - Of course I have! Can you write French? Better than you can. There's going to be a big demonstration. I have to copy 200 tracts for the students. The Ministry wants us to pay to take our degree. Can you help me? Is that why you wanted to see me? You were the one who wanted to see me. You almost jumped from the roof. Keep on dreaming... I would've caught you! I'm happy to see you. Stop that. I'm not here for myself. What for, then? Are you interested in Karima? - Karima? If you want to marry her you can send your mother. You came here for her? Yes. It's you I'm interested in. Because I can write French? Yes. So... what do you think? You know... politics isn't really my cup of tea but... I'll help you with the tracts. What did he say, Sarah...? Sarah, tell me, please... Please, Sarah... The wool! All he wanted to do was smoke and suggested we do too... I had to insist we stay there 'caus... he wanted to take us to a hotel! The only thing he talks about is girls... and politics... Not so loud! He says he adores girls. It's like that in his school. Every night they go out with girls and drink alcohol in bars. He doesn't even say what he wants to do later. He says marriage is out. Come on. - He did! He repeated it a couple of times. And he doesn't like Europe. He says it's the poor who go there and he won't go. He wants to fight here. - Who does he want to fight against? I don't know. Anyways, he doesn't want to get married. Here you are. - Thank you. What a shame... All the taxis have to pay 500 dirhams. Those who don't pay can drive back. Is it going to last? - The cops told me it was final. It's really too much, all prices have gone up: oil, flour. Today, you have to pay if you want to work. Thank God we still have some savings. - What savings? We'll find a way. - Like, a way with your brother? Like, another mouth to feed? You're forgetting what my brother did for you. Remember when he left. He was barely 18. You forgot about what he did, the taxi is thanks to him, and so is the house. And even my gold, I would sell it just to feed her. Things aren't that bad! Yasmine, is not my daughter. I won't feed her. She's my niece, my blood. You dishonored me before my kids. Eat, my son. Take it! Take it! Take it! Zora... Zora... I can't stay long! For how many? Is he reliable? It's my brother! I need him to help me go to Belgium. Nobody needs to know. And I'll pay before we leave. - Good luck in finding the money. You haven't eaten anything in two days. Where are you going? - Baker's oven. Get out of the way, move, fast! Take a move on! You guys are too much! Get lost! Poor little thing. - What's wrong with her? She fell down, just like that! Are you feeling better? I have grand-daughters your age. They love it. Another one! I have to bring the bread back. Very well. You're a good girl. What do you have there? Nobody's ever asked me that. When I was a bit older than you are I was busy with politics, freedom... I was advised to drop all that. Can't you knit bigger sweaters? You swine! Take it back! Thank you. Do you miss Belgium? I have to go now. - OK. Thank you. - You're welcome. Hello! Hello! Little sister, what can I do for you? How much? Are you taking it? It's big! Really big! So...? - Calm down... Listen, I can keep it for one or two days and if I sell it it's 50-50, OK? No, don't... Put it there! Goodbye. - Thank you. What are you doing? - I'm taking a walk. Are you going for your bread? Can I come with you? - If you feel like it. They're all over the place. By the way, have you finished the tracts? No, I... No, I haven't had time. I've really been busy. I've also been busy... thinking about you... No reaction to what I've just said? What do you want me to say? - Like... the same thing... I have other worries. Like what? Maybe I can help you. Our bread is expensive, our studies without future... She bought it? - Without discussing the price! She paid cash! - How much? 120 dirhams. - That makes 60 for me! Of course, but tell me little sister, we need to talk business! That makes 60! - OK, OK. Here you go, 60... I'm not through with you... The old lady, she wants 12 red sweaters for her family and... she's already paid! After France, we're leaving for Morocco. Important strikes are taking place in Al Hoceima. They are on strike against the high prices of basic food such as flour, sugar, and oil, as well as against the new rights to be paid to take their degree. Thanks. TODAY: SIEGE The sweaters are not hanging properly! I've come to get the money you owe me. How much? - I have it all. There you go. I'm leaving. - Bye bye. Good luck. Who's turn is it for the bread? - Not me. I'll do it. - Not you each time Sarah, no. Sarah, come along. Halima. Go ahead. Go ahead, come on! Halima. Halima. Mother. Who is it? It's your daughter, Sarah! Go away! Stop it! I'm your daughter! Who comes here to bother me? You are nuts, you! You're hitting your daughter! I'll wait for you here. Mother, come here. Where are you going? What's wrong? - I'm your daughter. I come from Belgium. - Belgium? You know my husband? He sent you, right? Do you have letters? Money? Anything? Let me talk. - Give me the letters. Give me the letters. I want to take you back to Belgium. I'm your daughter. Go away! You're making fun of me. - Come here. Leave me alone. Watch out! I'm your daughter, don't be scared. I'm your daughter! I'm your daughter! I want to see your face. Why are you doing that? Leave me alone! Where were you? I looked for you everywhere. Where were you?... I went to see my mother. What is this? It's not even carded! Go burn in hell! Do I have to keep an eye on you too!? Wait a second. Shame on you! If you don't have them I'll go see someone else. Is that the one? - Yes. Take this! Thank you. Hello. - Hello. Is everything all right? - Yes, thank you. Thank you. How are you? May God keep you. I really want to see you. I know where we can be alone. And they make fantastic fritters. - I'm not hungry. Sarah wait. I really want to see you. I don't go out without Karima. - I want to see you, not Karima. Then find her a boyfriend. I've never missed a single knitting class. Never. Not even when I was ill. Not even with a fever. Come here. Karim. Karima. Sarah. - Do sit down. Thank you. - Thank you. Beautiful house. - Thank you. It's his parents'. They're on holiday. In France, at their family. Close relations? - My sister is married to a Frenchman. My sister's just had a little boy. - Congratulations! Help yourselves. - Thank you. Are you a student like Nari? Now I'm helping my father. He's old and tired. He has two shops here and another one in the village. That's good, helping your father. Do you pray? - He's the one who calls to prayer. He's been doing it for a week. It's true. I'll go and make some tea. Can I help you? - Of course! He seems nice, your friend. He is. Is he serious? Who? - Karim. Is he serious? He's not going to have her hopes up for nothing. Are you serious? Otherwise he'll be hearing from me. Really? - Yep. I still have all those tracts to copy. There's going to be a sit in. We need all the support we can get. When is it for? - Can I leave you these? This is for you. What is it? - You'll see. What is it? - You'll see! Ciao. It's Karim! Come on, let's go. - Leave me alone. Come on. Come on. His mother is going to see mine next week to propose. What about you? What is Nari waiting for? Don't worry, it shouldn't be long anymore! It is true, my son is still young to get married. But ever since he's seen Sarah, he's crazy about her. He's become a different person. I don't know what she did to him. Oh, I forgot! Here's a photo of him, Madam. May God protect him. He is handsome! Congratulations. What about you, Sarah? What are you interested in? Many things Ma'am. Do you like children? - I love children. So does my son. He wants many children very soon. Would you like to have many children, too? Yes, but I'd rather adopt them. What? Adopt them? Allah protects those who adopt. Yes, but it's haram! Those children, nobody knows where they come from! These girls gave them birth and lost their virginity on the streets. It's haram. - No, they were made from love. Love is what counts not virginity Ma'am. Did you hear what she said? Are you sure she's still a virgin? Take a move on, you little slut! You dishonour me! Next... I'll wait here! There's nothing. What does that mean, there's nothing? - You're still a virgin. I never doubted. We are opening a special page about Morocco. Things seem to be changing. Important strikes have begun. - There are more soldiers than usual. The movement is intensifying... They are demonstrating all over town. The students are investing the schools and the streets. They want to defend their rights. In many towns, colleges... It's normal, everybody is fed up. Everything is expensive. I can only afford two small breads and it's not enough for our family. We have to be careful. Ever since Sheriff lost his job, it's the same for us. Thank God we have the knitting! - Yes, thank God. The forces deployed are panicking and shooting on the crowd. In Nador, some speak of a helicopter using a heavy machine-gun shooting blindly to disperse the demonstrators. It's demonstrations everywhere! What do they want? They should leave the school and let the children in. It's not right! - Some people think and others act! Well... She knows how to say things but doesn't know anything! Here, if they get caught they are going to be tortured or we're going to be told they moved away permanently. Fortunately, people are ready to risk their lives for their ideas! That's enough, Sarah! I want to check on my son. He's always outside when he shouldn't. Go ahead! I repeat, evacuate the streets immediately. Go back to your houses. Yacine. Youssef! Tell Yacine to come home. - I will. Yacine. Youssef. Yacine. Curfew! Go home! Don't go out! They aren't there! The children aren't there! Youssef. Yacine. Get inside! Go home! - My son is outside! My son is outside! My son is outside! - Go home! Auntie! My son is outside! - Go back inside, I tell you! Auntie! Close the doors! Yacine... God's hour has come... Yacine... Auntie! - Go back inside! My son! Go and get other dishes at home. It's all my fault! No, it's not your fault. - It's all my fault! Lured by the smell stood Master Fox. He hailed him in such words as these: Master Crow! Good day! How beautiful, how handsome you appear! How I should like to hear your note! For if your warbling's like your coat, You are the phoenix of the forests here. Hearing this, the crow was all rapture and wonder. To show off his handsome voice, he opened beak wide and let go of his plunder. The fox snapped it up and said: My good Sir, learn that each flatter lives at the cost of those who heed. ...he menaced: "You knew Moulay Hassan. I'm suggesting you, don't meet Hassan II". We are hungry! School for all! Get away from here! This is for Nari. - I also have something for you. You're crazy! You could end up in jail with those tracts! Wait! He had a thought for me... In fact, it's for Karima. Sorry. Of course... How's Nari? - I don't know. I haven't heard from him since he's in that college. I understand. I'll walk you back. Take care of yourself. Sarah, Sarah, there's a marriage proposal. It's OK. It's alright. What I'm going to suggest is very simple. I don't have a driver anymore and you're out of a job. You know me, I'm a good worker. - I know. What I want to say is I want my nephew to go to Europe. He needs a wife. A wife so that he can have papers. He needs a passport, then he'll leave her alone. That's why I thought of Sarah. I called my nephew, told him about it, and he agrees. Ahmed is crazy about his fiancÃ©e. It's just a wedding for papers, and then she leaves him alone. She'll go wherever she wants, do whatever she wants. I promise. I'll pay for the tickets, I'll pay for everything, so that she can go to Belgium! If you agree, she can leave very soon. What do you think? I'll talk to her. You don't have to... Sarah. Hurry up, the driver's there. Your things. Go! All set? Can we go?
