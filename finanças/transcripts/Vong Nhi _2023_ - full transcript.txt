CHARACTERS AND EVENTS IN THIS MOVIE ARE IMAGINARY. According to the statistic, each year averagely, Vietnam has more than 300,000 abortion cases. Sixty to 70% of them are students. Noticeably, the abortions at 12 weeks gestation accounts for nearly 80%. Please think it through before making up your mind. This is the life of a human. Will you keep the baby… or not? I'm scared, Sister. Please stay with me. - It hurts. - Hang on. Just a little more. Please stay calm and lie still, so that the doctor can do her job. No, I can't stand it. It hurts! Listen, just a little bit more. Try to loosen up your body. I cannot do it if you strain yourself. But it hurts too much. Hang on. I'm almost done. Stay strong! Don't leave me, Sister! It's all my fault. I took my baby's life. Mommy, cuddle me I want you to cuddle me Mommy, cuddle me I want you to cuddle me Mommy, cuddle me I want you to cuddle me Please heed my call, lost spirits of dead soldiers and civilians, orphaned children, and dead women below this ground. I pray for the peace of people in this house. Please accept my gratitude. Oh my God! Madam, why are you wearing all-white at night? What are you doing? I made an offering to introduce us to the spirits here. We just moved here, so we should let them know. We don't have an altar, so, I have to make do out here. Do you know Tung doesn't like these things? I know. - And you still do it? - It's spiritual. I'm not joking! Please clean it up right away. No way. They are enjoying their meals. Are you happy if I do that to you? In this family, we don't believe in this bullshit! Please. Whoever you are, please forgive my lady here! She's mature but unwise. She talks nonsense. I prepared the sweet offering. Please enjoy it and forgive her! You see? They accepted the offering. They forgave you. Are you insane? It's just the wind. It's so obvious! Are you a child? You like swinging on the swing and eating sweets, right? Please come to play sometime, but only when I'm not here. I will bring you more sweets. Is it okay? Let me do it. No, I can do it by myself. Nu? Mr. Teo came home finally. Mr. Teo. Mr. Teo… Master Tung, welcome home. If you were not my relative, you would have been fired. We've known each other since we were naked kids. Why are you all high and mighty now? What? What did you mumble? Nothing! Though we've known each other since we were kids playing in the rain, life has made me become your handmaiden. So, it's common courtesy for me to call you Master. How could life make you do anything? Your mother entrusted you to me. Here. My mother sent me? No. Bring it to my room. Yes, Master! Honey! Are you hungry? A gift for you. Thank you. I thought you'd forgotten today is our anniversary. Our fourth wedding anniversary. How could I forget? It's been four years already. Are you bored yet? Bored? Maybe I should try. Try what? I do not see anything. My food. Excuse me, sir. Madam, excuse me. Thank you. Thank you for making a warm dinner. It's true that there's no place like home. I love to cook for you. As long as you eat well, I'm happy. I really don't like using clichés. But honestly… I thank you for staying by my side all these years. God created such a perfect couple. Master is handsome and clever. Madam is beautiful and capable. I really look up to your happiness. It's a pity that you still do not have a child. Sorry. I mean you're infertile. No, I mean, you two are nice and kind! It's a pity you don't have a baby. You know what I mean... Nu, please take care of the kitchen. Yes. It's a pity a happy family cannot have a child while other pregnant women try to abort theirs. Committing those horrible crimes, there sure will be karma. Oh God! - What happened? - Oh no. - My God! - Are you okay? - Are you okay? - I'm fine. I'll go and change, okay? Are you okay? Madam! Madam! Nu, let's talk. Don't leave me, Sister! I took my baby's life. Who's there? Mommy! Mommy! Come and cuddle me! Mommy! Mommy! Come and cuddle me! Do you like my gift? Sorry for scaring you. Don't be. I was startled by the sudden sound from the doll. - Absolutely. This doll is cool. - Mommy! Mommy! Come and cuddle me! Just a noise or touch, it can cry, smile, say mommy, and play music. If you don't like these sounds, there's a button behind it to turn them off. Mommy! Mommy! Come and... She's cute. Look at this baby face. But why did you buy me a doll? I'm not a baby. I randomly bought it. Daddy tells you this. Get into your mommy's belly, then I can hold you. You hear me? Get into it! Wow! Turns out your gift is a baby doll. How cute is she! Why are you here? Sir, the beef is untouched. I don't know if you still want it or not. You go back to our dinner. I am right behind you. Be quick. The food will get cold. I know. Bye-bye, my baby. How cute you are! I'm listening, Aunt Ba. Have you seen Nhu recently? I tried to call her but got no response. I'm worried. I will find her. Thank you, dear. It's Ghost Festival month, yet people are flooding in to abort. Ms. Phuong! - Yes? - Turn off the water. I'm ordering food. What would you like to eat? There are a lot more appointments this afternoon. No need. I have mine already. Thank you! Please give it to Minh. I bought this for him. Thank you. He always talks about you. Really? He might be missing me. You know, I visited Minh the other day. We chit-chatted and then Minh told me to sing so he could record it and play it back when I cannot come visit him. I sang five or six songs in a row, but they didn't sound that good, so, I deleted them all when he didn't look. Are you happy at school? Yes, school is a lot of fun. You have friends at school. I want to go back to school. So do I. Then, let's get well soon, so we can go back to school. Yes. - Mom! - My darling! You look good today, Huy. I have a gift for you. Thank you, Ms. Phuong. Good boy. - Have some milk, Huy. - Yes. Ms. Phuong, you came! Yes. Be careful! I have a gift from Ms. Phuong. Did you thank her? You have a gift from Aunt Ngoc. Looks beautiful! It's a Rubik's cube. Mom, I have a gift for you. Really, I have a gift too? Sure. Ta-da! So beautiful! You're so talented. There's a beach and we're flying kites there. So beautiful! Minh. Minh. Minh. Minh. Don't scare me! Minh! Minh, please wake up! Nurse! My chicken! What the hell? Bring back the chicken! Good grief! The chicken barely touched down. The incense isn't even lit. The spirits have yet to smell the offering to them, but you snatched it right off! I spent the whole morning preparing the chicken. I shouldn't have made a feast. Living ghosts nowadays even outnumber the real ones. Namo Amitabha Buddha. Please forgive me for getting angry. Dammit! The girl in blue, she is faster than Haaland. We've been waiting in the sun, almost faded away, yet they snatched the chicken along with the dish. Now, nothing's left, even a smell. - Daddy! - What? Something smells like roasted pork with crispy crackling. Go! Hurry up! COMMIT NO NUISANCE Nhu! Nhu! Why did you come here? Your mom called. Why didn't you answer? You ignored me too. Why? ORPHANAGE Aunt Thuan. Welcome home, Aunt Thuan and Uncle Hai Be. What's wrong? I just want to let you know that I'll leave tomorrow. I have no problem with that. But as you can see, our orphanage has been dealing with all kinds of difficulties. If you leave, no one will breastfeed this baby. But I cannot stay for that long. I cannot bring her home either. My family won't accept her. I see. Bringing home a baby all of a sudden, that surely is a tough situation. How about this? You breastfeed her for just one more week, to make sure she's as sound as a bell. Then, you can leave. And… Take her inside and soothe her. The nailed plank bridge Were kept being nailed Mom! What? Are you sure that after breastfeeding for another week, she will change her mind and keep the child? How am I supposed to know? - Mom! - What else? Back in the day, how long did my mom breastfeed me? - One year. - What? She breastfed me for a whole year and still she left me? I fed you. How could you? Why not? You are bottle-fed. You drank a lot of milk and ended up being so tiny. Such a waste! Damn! Why didn't you just say so? "I bottle-fed you for a whole year, but you are still so small." You put an altar in your room? And even burn votive paper money? Are you out of your mind? Because I cannot sleep. Since the abortion, whenever I close my eyes, I see blood. I also hear a baby cry. So, I have to put an altar here. I think the baby resents me. Don't talk nonsense! The fetus was just four months old. It's lifeless. It doesn't have feelings. How do you know how someone feels that's had an abortion? It haunts me and keeps me stuck in nightmares. The fetus has feelings for sure. It's not lifeless like you said. Do you regret it or blame me for taking you to the hospital? I only blame myself for doing such a heartless thing. You should regret getting pregnant while you're a third-year student, not after having the abortion, you hear me? Think for yourself! Your mother in your hometown has a heart condition. Would she be able to handle this? How about you? You're still a student. How will you raise a kid? I depend on my husband, so, I can only help with your college fees. I cannot cover your whole life. Raising a kid is not simple. How can you do it by yourself? An abortion was the only way to settle everything. - Do you understand? - I don't understand. I don't want to. My head right now is full of the baby's legs and arms that are torn apart. It's hurtful and ruthless. Thinking about that, I can never forgive myself. I wish that I had never listened to you even once. Okay. In that case, you should remind yourself not to make this same mistake ever again. Don't blame anyone else! If you dare to do it, then don't regret it. Mommy… Mommy, cuddle me I want you to cuddle me Mommy… Madam! What the heck? Why didn't you knock? I knocked, but you didn't hear me. I thought you had some trouble. I'm sorry. What's the matter? The electricians are fixing the power line in our area. If they don't finish early, there will be a power outage tonight. Why did you come here? Master Tung called and told me to cook bird's nest soup for you. He said he still has to see many clients, so he will be home late. You don't have to wait. - Leave it there. - Yes. You should eat the soup and go to sleep early, madam. - Nu! - Yes? Did you touch her? I don't like playing with dolls. What's up? No, nothing. You can go. Let me prepare the candles just in case. Nu! Nu! Such a big house with frequent power outages. At this rate, my heart will fail one day. Why is there wind when the doors are closed? I have goosebumps. It must be them. I will not turn back. I'll faint if someone says hello. So, I'll say goodbye and leave! Go out! Help me! Darling, wake up! It's me. What's wrong? What happened? It… - What's wrong? - Why is it still here? It's just a doll. Why are you so scared? I have nightmares. I saw it. Don't worry! It's okay. Mommy, cuddle me I want you to cuddle… I've not seen you recently. We have a new young mom, so, I'm a bit busy. There are two cases today. It's big. More than six months old. You should be careful. We just changed the security guard. You should go. Please buy one ticket. My kids have not eaten since this morning. Keep it! Thank you. Hey! This is for your kids. Thank you so much! How rich you are! Mom. - May I ask you something? - What? If someone cannot afford to raise a child, does she have to bear it? What are you talking about? It occurred to me that if they cannot raise the child, maybe having an abortion is not wrong. Hey! If everyone thought like you, you wouldn't have been born. The life of a human is the most precious. No reason can defend the guilt. It's just a social perspective. Stop thinking that way. Are you bored doing this? Not at all. I love doing this. What a love like that! My leg! Let's go! Sit tight! THIEN AN MATERNITY HOSPITAL What happened back there… You should be more careful. If anyone finds out, it will be complicated. I know. Why are you leaving early? I am visiting Minh and paying his medical fees. Do you have enough money? I just got paid. Don't worry! I can afford it. Sis! Just tell me if you need help. - Okay, I'm leaving now. - Yes. Little one, please rest in peace. Forgive your parents. The fetus is that big. How cruel they are! If only they made an effort. If you cannot raise it, let others do it. Infertility is not rare nowadays. Me, for example. You've raised me since I was a foundling. It is not our first time doing this. Why are you getting mad? I wish we didn't have to do this. Madam is a yellow candle Master is a blue one I'm a roll of meaty rice cake You'll be full of me - Nu! - Yes? You're home. What is this? The offerings. I told you not to worship here. Why do you still do it? - Huh? - I said no superstition is allowed! Don't ever do it again! - But... - But what? I know you so well. Don't think you can do whatever just because we're related. Why always me? He is so bossy! I did not prepare this tray. Please. I'm so sorry. I was wrongly blamed. I cannot control my feelings. Forgive me! You must hurt, right? No. Just a little bit. Mommy! I'm here. One day, when I cannot be with you, don't be… don't be so sad! I want you to smile just like in the picture I drew. Don't talk nonsense! The doctor told me that you just need to hang on a little more. After the chemotherapy, you will get well soon. When I get well, Mom… I want to go back to school. Go to the beach and fly kites. Go to the beach and fly kites. As in the picture you drew for me? Yes. Okay. When you get better, I'll take you to the beach and fly a kite. Not only that, we can also collect coral and catch starfish. Do you agree? Yes. Be a good boy. You're tired. Get some sleep, dear. Mom. Can you tell me stories? Okay. I will tell you stories. But you have to promise me that you will tell me when you hurt. - Don't keep it to yourself. - Yes. You're so good and strong. Who's that? My God. Why do you wake me up at midnight? Please believe me! It was a child's soul. It knocked on the door and played the piano to call me out. When I was on the stairs, I bent over and looked through my legs. Then, I saw it crawling. I was so scared that I fell down the stairs. Not just for no reason. You stood on the stairs and hung your head upside down. No wonder you fell. No. They got mad at me because I shattered their offering tray the other day. But this is even creepier. I did not prepare that tray. That was mine. What? What are you saying? I made that offering tray. You did? Well, you always say, "With prayer, there is holiness," so I followed you. That's true. But it's too late. They're really mad now. There are spirits in this house. This time, don't tell me it's the wind. Without a doubt, you have been followed by an unborn soul. And it's a powerful one. It could be your sister's child. You led its mother to the abortion, so it bears a grudge and wants to harm you. So, what should I do now? Stick this talisman on the house’s door. It will scare the spirit away. Remember to give it an offering. Unborn souls that nobody worships and prays for will stay miserable and cannot be free. I need your hair and blood to cut the link between you two. So that it will no longer follow you. When did you start to eat fresh garlic? Your breath stinks of garlic! This is to expel demons. Thanks to it, I'm not scared anymore. Stop it! Don't talk nonsense! This household, from now on, will be safe and sound. Can I have some? When did you start to eat sour fruits like that? It tastes good. You look strange these days. I've just eaten a little. No, I mean… Thao! Yes? You look strange today, Thao. Are you out of your mind? I'm Nu. You look more like the mistress. Remember to pay my wife's salary. Honey, change clothes and come with me. Where are we going? - To see the doctor. - What for? You vomit every morning lately. Maybe I have stomach pain. Listen to me. You should check it out. Suddenly, she likes sour things, gains weight, and vomits. Seven weeks pregnant! Congratulations! Are you sure? I have ten years of experience. My love! Finally, after all these years, I'm going to be a father. Thank you, honey. Can I ask you something, Doc? Is it a boy or a girl? I'm curious too. With my ten years of experience, at just the seventh week, there's no way to tell the gender. I'm sorry. Little boy Huy has been gone. Minh hasn't eaten since this morning. He doesn't listen to me either. Please talk to him. - Where do we leave this? - Follow me. - Please be careful! - Yes. Slowly. Put it here. Two, three! Be careful. Quickly! Slowly. Put it here. You like it? - These babies are cute. - Of course! Luckily, we saved them just in time. Otherwise, they'd been gone for sure. Mom! Don't tell me you bathed me like this too? No. I put you in a boiling pot. For God's sake. You tease me all the time. Wow! It's my favorite color. And you didn't say a thing. Now, you love the baby more than me. You're jealous again! All is sweet as honey when it's your first child. More than one kid and you'll know the true taste. - Nu. - Yes? I'll increase your salary this month. - Really? - Yes. Thank you. Mommy, cuddle me I want you to cuddle me Mommy, cuddle me I want you… Mommy! Come and cuddle me! Get out! Get out! Get out! - Get out! Get out! - Thao! Wake up! Thao! What did you see? Thao! Thao! Thao! What's going on? - What's wrong, darling? - Why is the doll still here? I threw it away already. It's me. I thought it's a waste throwing it away, so I brought it back. - Thao. - Throw it away! Bring it away from me! - I don't want to see it here! - Thao, Thao! Calm down! Calm down, please! Tell me. What's wrong? What happened? I have nightmares. Don't be scared! I'm here with you. Don't be scared! Go back to our room. Don't be scared! Go to work, please. I know it's only a nightmare. I won't let anything affect our baby. You barely slept last night. You should get some sleep. I'll be back to take you to the doctor this afternoon. You don't have to. I'll go with Nhu instead. Let me take you to my friend, Doctor Bao. There's no need. I'm fine with my doctor. Doctor Bao is a man. I feel a little awkward. - But… - Don't worry! My doctor is as good as yours. I'm more comfortable with a female doctor. - I'm off to work. - Okay. - Drive carefully, honey! - Okay. I'm on my way. Do you have all the documents? Nu! Did you remove the talisman I stuck at the door? - What talisman? - Did you? No, I know nothing. ANTI UNBORN SOULS TALISMAN ANTI UNBORN SOULS TALISMAN Get out! Get out! What happened? Are you okay? What's wrong? Tell me what happened. Tell me, please! Don't cry! It's not good for the baby. Hello? What? Speak slowly. You're home. How do you feel now? When I got home, Nu told me. I'm really worried. I'm fine. Don't listen to everything she says. I… The baby kicked, so I… I was startled. And… since it's our first baby, I have no experience with this. Honey. Are you afraid of something? No. Nothing. Thao! Tell me what this is. Who made you believe these things? You should tell me the truth. This is… a lucky talisman. It's from Aunt Ba. Nhu told her we are having a child, so Aunt Ba sent it to protect us. This is an anti unborn soul talisman. Thao! Why? Why do you use this kind of talisman when you're going to be a mother? Actually… I took Nhu to the hospital to abort. So… Once upon a time, there was a boy named Minh. His mother was named Phuong. He was the cutest boy on earth! His mother loved him the most. Minh loved his mother too. Minh draws beautifully, especially when he draws his mother. You're here. Why did you come so late? I'm sorry. I had a day shift today. You know what? Every time I miss you, I play the recorder. I love hearing your voice. What I love the most is holding you like this. You're my pillow. The priceless gift that God gave me. I love you so much. I want you to be with me forever. I want you to hold me like this forever. You're such a good boy. I only thought that it was the best way for Nhu. I didn't know things would turn out like this. The unborn soul would follow me. How could I know that? Moreover, it was just a small gob of blood. It had no feeling. While we both were expecting to have a baby, you told her to have an abortion. How could you do such a horrible thing? I see. All the codes I buy are turning red. And real estate is hard to sell. We have been so unlucky recently. Give me one more week, I'll clear everything as soon as the bank disburses. I'll speak to you later. Goodbye. Why did you come here? Did you have lunch yet? Let's go out to eat. I'm not hungry. I'm busy. Have lunch by yourself. About last night... We will talk later, please. I'm so tired now. Okay, I'll leave you to work. I'm sure it's trying to reincarnate into your womb and take revenge. She will follow you and haunt you forever. Your husband's business is just the beginning. After that, it will wreak havoc in your family and completely destroy your life because you took her life. This child has a strong resentment. You definitely should not keep it. WAITING AREA How many abortions did you have? Only one. Are you sure? How many? Three times. Miss! I'm from Little Angel Orphanage. As I see it, people come here on their own only when they want an abortion. I think that you… Please don't do that! If you want to, I can help you keep it and raise the baby. Leave me alone! Stay away from me! It's the smell of blood. These are fetuses that are freshly pulled out of the womb. We retrieve them from clinics like this and bury them properly to comfort them. If you dare to seek an abortion, then, I think, you can look at them at least once. I hope this miserable child will make you change your decision. Stay away from me! Go away! Depression during pregnancy is quite popular. Some can overcome it, some have to take medicine. More importantly, the family should be by her side to make sure she feels comfortable. Otherwise, it would affect the baby. Thank you. I'm sorry for calling this late. DEPRESSION DURING PREGNANCY You're back! Take a shower. I'll bring you clothes. I want you… to forget the past. Don't believe in talismans or superstition. Or our baby will be affected. I know… this is a very tough time for you. Since it's your first time being a mother. I will always be by your side. I love you two so much. I was wrong. I'm flying. Catch me. Gotcha! I want to play on the slide. Play on the slide? Let's go! Come with me, Mommy. Wait for me. Let me join you. Today, City Police arrested Nguyen Van Nam, born 1978. He confessed to spreading superstition and appropriation of property by telling fortunes and selling talismans. Gosh, people must be out of their minds to believe in him. Many victims gave him a lot of money. Darling! You are not allowed to watch unhealthy channels. They affect our baby's mental health. Our baby is small. How can it understand? The total opposite. I'm an example. When I was still in her belly, my mom always watched reformed theater. That is why I'm so cute. You look the same too. Thank you. No, you are like this because you fell into the well twice. Teo, be careful! I know your story. What story? Nu, tell me about Teo when he was little. Actually, his name is not Teo. It's "teo". He liked to poke the dog at my house. Unfortunately, one day, the dog went crazy and bit him. It chased him around the neighborhood. By the time he got rescued, his pants were torn to shreds. His pecker was shrunken, like this. Ever since, we all called him "teo". Later, when we moved to the city, I changed it to Teo to be more polite. Enough? A pay cut this month! Aunt Thuan. - What's wrong? - I… I breastfed my baby one more week. Please let me… continue to raise her. That's great to hear! You don't even have to ask me. It's good that you changed your mind. Go with her. I'll help you to pack your things. Goodbye, Aunt Thuan. Goodbye, Brother Hai. Goodbye. If only everyone had the strength to take responsibility like her, they wouldn't need a man. And we wouldn't have to do things. You're right! But chit-chatting aside, if a woman lived without a man she'd have much more to worry about. And maybe, because of all their worries and fears, they have to seek such an inhuman thing. But… I see you don't have any man by your side, but you're still doing good things. So, what are you, then? Are you a man or not? Yes, I'm a man. A little man. You talk too much! I had a memorial tablet made for you here, in this temple. Now, you can hear Buddhist scripture every day. So you can rest in peace and transcend soon. I vow to do good deeds to make up for my mistakes. My dear… I'm sorry. Now I know… that I was so wrong. Back then, I only thought that… it was the best way for your mother. It's all my fault. I was ruthless. I'm begging you… please let us live in peace. Please don't haunt me anymore. And if… you are really here, then… can we be mother and child? Please? - Mommy. - Yes? Where are we going? I have a surprise for you. Now, close your eyes and I'll start counting. One, two… - three! - Ta-da. Your mother made it for you. Do you like it? It's beautiful. Thank you. Thank you, Mommy. - Have fun! - Thank you. You're welcome. Do you like it? Of course. Minh, my dear. We will fly the kite here for now. Okay. When you get well, we'll go to the beach and fly kites just like you've always wanted. Okay? Sure. Let's fly this kite. Yes. - Let's go. - Fly. Gliding. Gliding. Fly. It's beautiful. Gliding. Fly. Gliding. Do you like it? Fly. Fly. Want to play? Stop. Put it on your face. Let's eat. Stop spinning. You will break my hula hoop. Your hula hoop? Amazing! Why did you keep smiling on the way? There was no calls from the hospitals. We have nothing to do, so, I'm happy. I'm happy, too. Madam! After your baby is born, could you give me your maternity clothes? Thank you. I will stop watching the Annabel series. So boring! This book is full of words, with no pictures at all. I have to admit that she looks very much like it. Honey. Don't look at her too much. It would affect our baby. I will only look at you. My mother taught me Girls are like treasures They walk with beauty Their eyes are lovely I'm so honest, truthful, no trickery If you love me, then shut your mouth-y I'm returning your dress, ma'am. We're doomed. Annabel got mad at us. THIEN AN MATERNITY HOSPITAL Minh's become worse. You and your family should prepare for the worst. We're so sorry. Sis! Are you okay? Come in. Hi! INPATIENT ROOM Hello. I'm listening. Sis! What's the matter? Sis! Tell me. Sis! Is Minh… What happened to him? Minh… has passed away. Minh! My son! How was your prenatal check-up? What did the doctor say? The doctor said we're both fine. Don't worry. She told me to relax, eat well, and have gentle exercise. It's even better if you take me to the shopping mall regularly. Every time I offer to take you to the clinic, you always say you went already. You're so busy, I can go myself. What's wrong? I need to go to the lady's room. - Wait a minute. - Okay. Thao? Is it you? Thao! Thao! It's been a long time. Please forgive me. I don't want to see you ever again. Come here! Come join us. One, two, three. Jump! It's fun here. - Thao. - What? Come over here. What's wrong? Why did you lie to me? You said it's a team building trip, but there are only men here. All your boyfriend's friends. They all are colleagues, not strangers. You know, they all like you, there for… I know you're still single, so I arranged this opportunity for you. I just want to focus on my job. I don't want a love story. Why so serious! Hey. Let's just choose one and let him take care of you. You can dump him when you get bored. - You think they're stupid? - No. They're not stupid, but us women could be smarter. Understand? It's just me here. I'm not comfortable. I'm here too. Do me a favor and stop being grumpy! Let's play. Here comes the princess! Come here! Come here! - Cheers! - Thao, cheers! I'm full. - Cheers, babe! - God, you're ruining the fun! Where are we going? - Come inside with me. - Quickly! Then, come out to play. Let's drink! I'll go to sleep now. What do we do? Stay away from me! Please! Honey! - Please! - Thao! Honey! It's me. A nightmare again? It hurts. What… Oh my God! What happened to me? Honey! I'll take you to the hospital. How is she? She's stable now. I did a general check-up. You can take her home after the transfusion. Thank you. Did she have regular prenatal check-ups? Did you know about her condition? What condition? Your wife had an abortion before, so the lining of the uterus is thin. It's hard to keep the baby. There's one more thing. I want you to stay calm. Your baby has Down Syndrome. She will have severe disabilities. As your friend, I think you should not keep the baby. Please discuss this with your wife. Honey. Please let me explain. I never wanted to lie to you. It's not important anymore. Don't explain anything. I didn't have enough courage to tell you about my past. The more you say, the more I feel that you don't respect our marriage. I was raped. I was raped! Three men, they took turns to rape me! When I got pregnant, I didn't even know who the father was. How could I keep the baby? I never wanted it to happen. I didn't want anyone to know about this. I didn't want to remember it. Until I met you. You loved me and you protected me. I thought that I just needed to stay quiet, bury it in the past, and live my present life to the fullest, then, it would be alright. Little did I know... It's me who's caught by surprise. The woman I've loved so much for so long is the one who's lied to me time after time. If only you had been more thoughtful, our baby wouldn't have turned out that bad. No, it's not. I didn't go to the check-up because I was afraid Doctor Bao would find out that I had an abortion. That's why I hid it from you. It's too late. You must abort it. Honey. Don't… Please forgive my past and have mercy on our child. I'm begging you. Don't make me do it. I'm really scared. Do you know how it breaks my heart deciding to let the child go? Today, I had five spoons of soup and half a glass of milk too. Aunt Ngoc and the doctor said that I was so good. She said if I keep eating this well, I will get well very soon. I really hurt today. I guess I won't be able to go to the beach with you as promised. One day, when I'm gone, I want you to just miss me. You definitely have to keep yourself from crying. I just want you to smile. Minh. Sleep tight. And promise me that in the afterlife, you'll be a healthy boy. Promise? Farewell, Minh! My brave son. Sleep tight. When you wake up, you will find yourself in a beautiful and peaceful world. There will be no more pain. When you miss me, you can play this recorder to hear my voice. I love you so much. We'll meet again. My baby. My baby. My baby. Excuse me. Do you know where that stretcher goes? Give me back my child. Give me back my child. Give me back my child. Nhu! Nhu! Sister. Sister. Sister! Life and Death separation. But you always loved her the most. I feel sorry for you, Uncle Teo. It is pitiful! Why… Why… Why is it not me? Why did you leave me? If only we had known, things wouldn't have turned out like this, right? My heart breaks just at the thought of it. It's all my fault! It's all my fault! My fault! I'm going to cook something for you. I cannot eat. Don't cook. We finally meet, do we? But why are you here? Where do you live? Here I am. Mommy! Mommy. I've been waiting for you for so long. UNNAMED CHILD - 12 WEEKS OLD May 14th? You… Are you my daughter? I never had the chance to become a child. I am very sad. It's cold and dark out here. I'm so scared. Now you've met me, please love me a lot, Mommy! How did you find me? Ever since you aborted me, I have always been by your side. But I know you were scared of me and didn't want to see me. So, I was angry at you. I'm so sorry. At that time, I was not brave enough to keep you. I was scared of the responsibility of an unwanted child. I was merciless. I killed you… just to satisfy my resentment. I am so sorry. Don't cry, Mom. I'm not angry at you anymore. But now, I won't be able to be with you anymore. This is the last time we will meet. Why? Where are you going? I've stayed here for a long time. Now, I have to go because I don't resent you anymore. Don't go anywhere. Don't! You have to stay here with me. Don't go! Mommy, I don't want to be unnamed. Can you give me a name? I love you, my dear. Your name is Thuong. It's Thuong. Okay? I love you so much, Mommy. Goodbye, Mommy. No. Thuong. Thuong. Thuong. Thuong! My dear! Please don't leave me. My dear. - Please keep the baby. - Leave me alone. Stay away from me. If you dare to seek an abortion, then I think you can look at them at least once. I hope this miserable child will make you change your mind. Honey. Why did you leave me? You must be… very mad at me, right? I'm sorry. How could I know that things would… end with you passing away. I don't want to leave you and our child. But… now, it's too late. Don't be mad at me. I've seen my child. She forgave me. But… she left me forever. I'm sorry. It's all my fault. I could not control my anger. It's not just about your past. If only… Back then, I should have let you know that… the doctor told us to get an abortion. Our baby had Down Syndrome and would be born with disabilities. I chose the wrong way to tell you the truth. I didn't know that… I would lose both you and our baby. I'm sorry. Honey. I'm still alive. Why did you put my portrait here? It's just a dream. A dream. Wake up, Thao! Wake up! Please! Wake up! Please! Wake up, Thao! Honey! I'm dead for real? Who is Ms. Thao's family? Sister. Do you hear me? Sister! Sister. Since you've been gone, he's numb with grief. He thinks of you all the time. He doesn't even eat. But he keeps reminding me to cook your favorite dishes. Life and Death separation. I feel sorry for Uncle Teo. I feel so sorry for him. I want to live. I want to be his wife. I want to bear… many children. I want to be a mother. I want to be a mother. Please! No. I'm still alive. I'm still alive. I'm still alive. Thao. Are you here? Thao, answer me. Thao! My dear child, do you know that I love you with all of my life Looking at you in your cradle Your innocent eyes, they're so lovely Oh, my baby is up. Oh, my sweetie. My daughter is so cute. Want to go out? Go out with me. Let's play on the slide. Let's play, Mommy! Let's go! - You're so cute. - Let's play, Mommy! There are mistakes you will have to carry even beyond your death. Again? How can you see it so many times while I haven't seen it once? Because your mind is still unclear. Huh? Talking nonsense! I will cleanse my mind. I really want to keep the baby. But I am still a student. Keep it or not, it's your decision. A baby is a priceless gift from heaven. Not everyone's blessed with it. Please think carefully before making your decision. I don't dare to tell my parents. If they found out… they won't stand it. I… I… TO COMMEMORATE OUR CHILDREN, LET'S HOPE THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE TO TELL THESE SORROWFUL STORIES…
