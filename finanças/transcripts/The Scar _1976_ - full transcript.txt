Is everything under control? There must be no mistakes. Our big test is coming up. -Jan. - Yes? The worst houses, the hovels, the ruins - do we have pictures of them? - Yes, enlargements. - Good. And the missing houses? Good. Powerful images. Has the water been pumped? It's been done, sir. Good. What time did you get up,Jan? Half past 4:00, sir. I hope they'll let us get up later now. What's this list? People attending the meeting. Cross him off. Him too. I don't want to see him here. You already have, sir. What's this? Who wrote this? Keep that journalist out of here. -Jan. - Yes? - Will the people outside come? - Yes. Of their own accord. They want this. Think I don't know it? We're working for them. They want it, but you'll have to get them here. That's your job. It's serious. Quickly, in rows of four. Here, four by four. Screenplay- Dialogue Directed by KRZYSZTOF KIESLOWSKI Photography by SLAWOMI R I DZIAK Produced by ZBIGNI EW STANEK Let's go to town. THE SCAR Five provinces want this factory, and there have been dozens of commissions. The decision must be made quickly. I have some pictures to show you. Here. See how people live in our town. They need a place to work. Our province has always lost out on industrial investment. This is a break for us. We must grab it. Opinions differ. An article in this paper criticizes the location. We must take public opinion into account. Have you read it? No. Public opinion, you say? Here. This is what they're saying. Come look, comrade. The minister should see this too, and all those who lecture us on the beauty of nature. Everyone wants work in the factory. They need work! Look at them. And look at the pictures. Is this my coffee? Yes. Bravo for your window idea. We will build here, and soon. Comrade, who will the director be? Has that been decided yet? I don't want to... Excuse me, comrade. May I... - Do I know you? - Yes. We have a local man in mind. He's very experienced. Sure. What's his name? - Hello. - Good morning. - Did they play well? - Very well. You know more than me. What's the score? A pushover. No, he won't be in today. Your plane ticket to Warsaw. They called. - Do I need anything? - No, they need you. - For how long? - They didn't say. - Did you ask? - Yes. Stefan! - You're here? - Hello. - Changed jobs? - No. How do you like Silesia? They forecast rain and it's fine. It rained a bit. Listen, this is important. And it's my baby, as usual. You're still the same. Yes, well, listen to this. Prepare yourself. This is big. Go ahead. You've been appointed to Olecko. - Really? - Yes. We're late. Your plane was delayed. Why did Eva come? It's only for a few days. She needs a rest. She's not well. An abortion? That girl! Stefan, ease up... Did you go to Warsaw? Olecko. I'm not going there. I don't want to go back. No one there is gonna remember an event from 20 years ago. Don't kid yourself. They'll remember. - I won't go back. - I'll set things straight. We'll set things straight. Listen. If you did the wrong thing... No. - If you... - No, it's not that. If people remember... I did the right thing. What about the dog? I'll take him. Who set you on my tail? Come on, sir. You know how it is. I've got a story to cover, that's all. It's really huge. Yes, it's big. You see, sir... I'm trying a new approach. Let's just talk. - Go ahead. - Be frank about your problems, your difficulties. Frankly... It always works on paper, but the reality is very tough. Are you filming? Then we better put it another way. - Right. Cut. - Don't you agree? Cut. This isn't a movie. No second takes. Have you researched this area? My uncle lives here, Professor Michta. I know him. All right. Ready to go? Fine. We are on a vast site. A few months ago, a forest grew here. Now bulldozers are busy over the area. This is Stefan Bednarz, the factory director. What aspect do you consider most important? It's a great opportunity for the district. Olecko is a lovely town, but it's been a bit forgotten. Tolo, look. The forester lived on the edge of the woods only six months ago. Those trees are two centuries old, right? The price of civilization... I've filmed around here before. Six miles from here, - it's just sand. - Six miles from here, it's another province. They hadn't invested enough here, see? My God, where are we going? I think speaking one's mind is excellent, but your fears are unfounded. Be patient and trust us. Although things are difficult and rushed, this development is useful and valid. All that sounds very fine, but why the delay? Why wasn't there a design competition? Okay, the factory is being built. But what exactly are you doing for our town? Do you have more projects with this architect? We don't want them. We prefer our old town. We see the harm you're doing. Walk around the Dzialki district. It's in ruins, all the houses torn down. Bulldozers are destroying everything people built for their old age: their gardens and trees, all destroyed right now. I do understand, but we're talking about infrastructure - What infrastructure? That 1 ,600 feet of piping that's old and too narrow anyway? Houses used to stand there. You demolished them in two days! Citizens, your comments lack wider vision and a long-term social approach to the development of your town. You're airing personal grievances. That's an insult! - Calm down! - This is a technical meeting. - Order, please! - Straight facts, sir! Mr. Chairman, citizens, I must express my surprise and disappointment. A forest is at stake of over 20,000 acres. Before it has even been built, the factory is devastating all the surrounding areas. Some wells were drilled on the site, causing drought in the area. The villages lack water. Park over there. Why Olecko? Why our town? The somewhat questionable merit isn't yours, no. Bednarz is responsible. He's no ordinary engineer and technocrat. He's another breed: a genuine humanist. He wants his town to flourish, but he forgets that he's mortal, and after he's gone, he might be replaced by a pigheaded technocrat with a philistine mentality, who will destroy everything he fought for- the theater, for instance, and all that... I've been watching your face, Mr. Chairman, and I see a smug, self-satisfied man, convinced that he's doing the best thing for the good of others. So I ask you if you've been listening to what we're saying... What is it? Yes, Lech is with me, but he's busy. You have to sort it out yourself. Well, Stasio? I know there's been trouble between you two, conflicts even, but that was 20 years ago. It doesn't concern me. It's your business. Do I have to spell it out? You know about it, and I can't explain it to you. I'm going to speak frankly, Stasio: I need you on Bednarz's team. Is that you? Who? You? Come on, come on. - Hello, sir. - Hello. He knew you were coming. He had the whole house cleaned up for you. Everything all right? You used to live here. Old memories, eh? - Going upstairs? - No, I didn't plan to. My assistant. Have him join me on the site. Mr. Bednarz? - You sent for me? - Yes. Now listen. Some young sociologists are on the way. Their line is surveys and opinion polls on converting a village into an industrial town, on changing mentalities. Let them get their PhDs. But I need - the lowdown on the general mood... - A deal? You've got me wrong. I want information, not denunciations. Figures and trends. - Arrange a dinner with them. - Right. Is that all? Put them on the payroll. Fix it up. Get them started right away. What do you want? Why here? Over my dead body! Go on, crush me! Crush me! I won't let you through! Stop! Stop the work! Stop! - I won't let you through! - Get down, sir. - Calm down. I've called a halt. - I won't let you through! I say no! - We've stopped. -Journalists... - Were you filming? - No, I'm on my own. - Hello. - Hello. Thank God! Break it up, please. - In the future, let me know. - What's the point? I said let me know. May he have long life A long, long life My dear director! At last! Welcome. It's just us here. You know Jan, Lech from transport, the head architect, director of agriculture, public prosecutor. The work's going well. The bedrooms are upstairs. And here's something simply splendid... The bathroom! Sorry, Komorek. Don't mind us. Tiles... the whole works! This is the project! It's a bad location. - Mr. Chairman! - Excuse me. See, it even eats cigarettes. Mr. Chairman... take a look at this! It's no good. You're funding it, though. Yes, but it's your project. You're the construction manager. Afterwards we get the flak. - Cigarettes... - Okay, okay. Only a few houses are affected. They're people's homes. - You've made a big mistake. - Maybe. But that doesn't change anything. If we don't build there, we waste a year, and you need that housing in six months. - I'll manage without it. - How? You promised housing. I'll transport them in buses. How many roads can we build? Lech! Head of municipal transport. Stasio, what is the state of the roads after rain in this area? Right now, 5 5% of the roads are unusable. - A drink? - Yes, please. Let's drop it. Drink up. Dear director, can we use Christian names? I'd be delighted to. - Bolek. - Stefan. What are they doing? She ate my whole pack! But she won't say hello. We have to get to know each other. Let's have a drink with Lech. We're old friends. - My cigarettes! - Bitch! You don't want Lech? Sure I do. Cheers. Where do I live? There. Here we are. Good morning. Settling in, I see. This is the kitchen. Bathroom. Your bedroom. Your wife's bedroom. And here's your study. We can put a door in and join the two apartments. - What's in there? - Two small rooms. - That's fine. - Sure is! - Got the keys? - Sure. It's tiny. It'll do fine for me. Just one thing. Could you find me some blinds? I want to set up my darkroom. No problem. There are lots at the school. - Can you? - What slobs! I'll have it all cleaned up. Well? I'll take it. Shall we go? You go. I'm staying. - I'm at home. - Bye now. - Hello. - Hello. How's it going? We're managing, Minister. I hear you don't want Stanislav Lech? The municipality is for him. So are we. Don't be stubborn about it. Can't I choose my own deputy? The municipality doesn't want him. They're handing him over to me. Two coffees. Be discreet about it. It's a question of tactics. Do I have to teach you that? I've heard... that your TV appearances aren't appreciated. They don't want a highway or modern houses. Public opinion... Don't make things hard for yourself. To get back to Lech, his presence in the factory isn't a compromise. It's wise. Aren't there more important issues? Yes, that's the point. Your coffee, Minister. Your tea, sir. Your number's ringing. Shall I put you through? - Not now. - Yes, go ahead. Feel free. Excuse me. Eva? It's me. I want to see you. Are you free? Let's say 6:00 at the Kameralna. Hello, Dad. How are you? You're hard to reach, Eva. Don't call me there again, Dad. Here's my new number. Your new number... 44... 84... 73. - How's the dog? - Fine. This is your... fourth number. That's no way to live. You have to know what you want. Is your life the way to live? Changing your work, your town, your house? I don't know. You leave Mom on her own. Is that a way to live? She didn't want to come. You don't understand her. She didn't want to. Anyway, you may have forgotten, but we didn't leave on a whim. Your mother ran the cell in high school. They fired Lech, a teacher. Some small farms had been shared out. Times were different then. We left in '56. So many years ago... Mom still dwells on it. You should see her point. Can you find her some work? Whenever she likes. In the same school? Mom must be sick of it. I'm sick of it. I've wasted two years studying so I wouldn't owe you. - Drink up. - It's stifling in here. I do everything wrong, don't I? No. Should I have left you alone? Maybe your mother is better off alone. - Name? - Witucki. - First name? -Josef. - Education? - School certificate. Address? Wigury Street. Do you want an apartment? - An apartment? - Yes. Next. No pushing. Don't push. You'll all be admitted. - How many technicians? - Two. - What about you? - Five? - How many technicians? - Seven, nine. - How many have you got? - Twelve. - Primary education? - Forty-nine. - Without school certificates? - 21 1 . - Good. Can I make a call? - Sure. Mr. Bednarz? It's going well. So far we have 3 2 technicians, 21 0 guys with certificates. Hang on. What is this? Calm down. Everyone will be seen. Make room. Is anyone hurt? Move along. I said 21 0 with school certificates, and 680 without. It's a free-for-all... Yes, on the other side. All right with you? Four o'clock? Is that definite? Okay, I'll tell him. Everything's fine. Yes, thank you. They're starting at 4:00. - Bednarz, yes... - Over here, Hania... - The director must sign here. - I'll see to it. I did tell you... What? Yes. Fine. Okay. Good-bye. - Who signed that? - Head of transport. His name? Lech. Get me the head of personnel. Hania. Will you call Piramowicz? Hania, I'd like some tea. - Me too. - Right away, sir. - Will you be back? - Yes. Set up the pumps. What? Yes. And the frequency? Cheer up. Check the pumps. At last. Hold on... Why didn't I know we have a head of transport? - How long has he been working? - A month. The municipal council recommended him. He's from the Board ofTransport. Yes... the frequency. Why didn't you tell me? We needed a man who knows everybody. But why wasn't I informed? The technical director endorsed it. I just told you! Check the pumps! I want to know who we employ. You no longer work here. Sir... You granted subsidies to sociologists who don't work for the production. You don't work here anymore. They don't have subsidies. - Yes, they do. - Really? The French. Katowice for you. I said it'd be fast. Thank you. It's me. I know it's you.! Sorry,justjoking. It must be late. What's up? Quiet, it's my husband. - It's 4:00 a.m. - What's going on? I could be asleep... What is it? We're inaugurating the factory tomorrow. You should come. What are you doing? Now? It's my birthday. Lots of useful things: learning English, housework... How's the dog? He's asleep. Listen... happy birthday. Thanks. Stefan. Eva's coming to see you. She called me today. She wants to bring her boyfriend, - a photographer or something. - That's good news. - Hello. - Hello. This looks all right, doesn't it? I have to shoot 20 minutes a month. - Mr. Bednarz. - What is it? - We're ready. - Coming. Good-bye. Head computer scientist... Doesn't he know too much? He certainly does! You see! - A sight for sore eyes. - Listen... - We had to get people here. - Forget it. Excuse the informality... From your father. Thank you. Come and join us. - Later, maybe. - We'll expect you. Thank you. Excuse me, sir. Perhaps you might have a job for me... I remember you when you were a toddler. You're called Eva, aren't you? Me and my buddy were cutting down trees and he said... - See the head of personnel. - It's better to see you. Say I recommended you. You're a lovely girl. No offense meant. No offense taken. Here's to the director. I say... Have a drink with me. Sergeant, throw that drunk out. - Where? - Over by the buffet. Do it. Be a man! Hold it! I'm not going nowhere! Look. No one has the right to treat a citizen like this. Why? Just tell me why? You even lit up the hillside? That's the cemetery, Eva! Tell me, Dad... are you happy about all this? Is the great Bednarz happy? I'm doing my job. You're a builder. This isn't your job. You can't handle human problems. You sound just like your mother. Drop it, Dad. But still... you did treat Lech badly. You refuse to admit it. It's ridiculous. Why? You're strong, but you don't have the courage to say to him, ''I'm sorry. I was wrong.'' Want to know what happened here 25 years ago? No, I don't. What I care about is today. Did you see what they did to the guy you promised a job to? No. They kicked him out of your fabulous party. Don't you have the feeling that nothing depends on you anymore? Let's not talk about the site. Let's talk about me. What do you know about me? Nothing, and you're afraid to find out. Because I break... the ties that bind me, you see? You think that's a solution? Yes. So you have those abortions? The UN Security Council in New York will examine the deteriorating situation in Vietnam. Now for home news: The chemical factory in Olecko was inaugurated today. The culmination of four years'hard work by thousands of people. For four years Olecko was one of the largest building sites in Poland. The inauguration was attended by government members and Party leaders. Factory representatives, director Stefan Bednarz, head builderJan Marcinlowski and coordinatorJan Wojcik were awarded medals by the minister of chemical industry, in the presence of a member of the Political Office. From year one on,, they must produce 3 2,000 tons of nitrates that our agriculture needs. A tour of the factory and a review of the perspectives followed the inauguration. The workforce put forward a series of social improvements. The day ended in festivities. We will cover that in our next news program. - When did you get it? - Yesterday. It's really something. A Sonar. Yes. - What's that? - A reflex. Superb. Look. What magnificent horses. I'm trying to listen objectively, and my conclusion is that this investment transforms your town, which was perfect. I must tell you - it's no secret - that I know this town. I've lived here, and I know there were problems here. People said other towns were developed, never this one. You say you're expanding the factory? Yes, to three times its present size. - What? - You're not serious? Just look out the window. These are the problems we must solve. Your arguments are trivial in comparison. Mere details! Details! For God's sake! This may seem drastic, but in my opinion - a wider view is called for. - Wider? When the doctor can't visit my sick child because there's only one clinic and ten times more people than before! Is that a detail? You're the expert here... Yes, but in the factory. Not in the town, I'm afraid. Don't you want to find out how we live? Come shopping, see the nursery school? You talk to us about society, but in the meetings when we're in your place, you wouldn't believe what we hear. Social problems can't be solved your way, sticking slogans up all over town. We didn't put them up. Madam, I'd like to outline calmly the management's attitude, our director's attitude. Everything you've put forward and we've listened to - now please understand this - is outside our province. You must approach the council as citizens. Then we can do something. I think I'm speaking for everyone present: You should feel as concerned as we do. We're all members of a socialist society. - Right? - You're bringing out the big guns. We don't need reminding. We've covered a lot of issues. We shall try to draw some conclusions. Thank you. Thank you. Just what we expected. - Right. Thank you. - Good-bye. Good-bye. Hania, sit down. In the future, don't show delegations into Bednarz's office, okay? But it's not my fault. I don't make the decisions. Just don't let them in to see him. Send them to me... or to Lech. Preferably to me. - All right. - Bednarz is too busy. - Very good. - Thank you. It's nothing. Interesting. What will you do with it? I'm sending it to the ''Polityka.'' With your photos? Why? Create controversy. A good career move. You'll be talked about. I brought you here to give you an objective view. You can order other results. You have the means to do so. You don't know me very well. Lies don't interest me. You talk about resentment and anxiety, but when you question people in your surveys, don't forget what the issues are. We have a good view from here. I want you to be convinced. I want to convince you personally. We've only just begun. We're here because we believe in you and in what you're doing. As for our own work, it's a way to discover the truth. But there's a difference between the truth and what we believe. We want the truth. It prevents mistakes being made. My mistakes? Mistakes in general. I know it isn't your intention, but this will be taken as a list of my faults. Are you going to publish it? - Not necessarily. - If you approve. I'll make you publish it. But not right now. Hello. Eva just had a baby. When? Last night. I took a train at dawn. So she was pregnant when I saw her. She's dropped out of college and moved back home. To your place? Back home. If you need money or anything... Come up on the stand. Then we'll go and eat. Okay. I haven't slept. A little girl? - What is it? - Why is he here? Who? Lech. He's working for me. I want to go. Wait a minute. I can't. The concrete is disintegrating. The girders are breaking. We must stop the work. The rain is bringing down tons of saltpeter. There's no alternative. We need a huge funnel. How far will the saltpeter spread? - Four to five miles. - A vast area. CLOSE DOWN THE FACTORY I remember when you were appointed, Comrade Bednarz, head of the complex. The main reason was the inside experience you had gained among the workers in major industry. In view of our responsibility as a Party organization, we have informed the Party executive of the situation. The difficult situation confronting us in Olecko... Over to the secretary of propaganda. Comrades, the problem is clearly set out in the documents and reports. I'd like to emphasize the connection between the overall problems and the ideological attitude of the factory workers. The slogan on the wall was an irresponsible act, but it has made the atmosphere in the factory even more unhealthy. It has set tongues wagging all over town. And you have acted with great inefficiency. You could have erased it before 1 0:00. You know Olecko so well. You know everyone working in the factory. You know them all. Yet conflicts still arise. You've failed to create a good atmosphere, even though you work well. Comrade Secretary of the Olecko district. We're looking for an answer to this question: how to improve the factory situation? This question should be put to all the workforce, as no one knows better than they do the root of the problem. You must let people do their work and make decisions, Comrade Bednarz. But for a while now, for quite a while, the director doesn't see people, or listen to them. He doesn't have faith in them. You should have helped him, - pointed it out... -Just a minute... Before you answer, Comrade Director, I have one more question. The cessation of the building work also springs from a lack of ideological conscience. You were one of the first people on the spot. You didn't inform the cell or the district committee. You decided alone. You can't act like that, Comrade Director. But it was necessary, even if the sense of injustice was subjective... - Comrades, I'd like to... - Go ahead. Stefan, we worked together in Olecko. I think that after I left, you took on a lot that we used to share with the Party militants, with the unions... and the administration, right? People got into the habit of going to see Bednarz instead of the municipal council. Even when it wasn't within your province. You got them used to it, and this is the result. Not on your own! You never go far alone. You suffocate. Thank you. One question, Comrade Bednarz: Do the secretaries' conclusions seem clear? Will you work with the Party and the unions to eliminate this negative phenomenon concerning the factory? Yes, I will do my best to eliminate the problems that should be eliminated, but I must warn you that I cannot change the way I work or the form it takes. I can't become someone else, switch personalities. Hey,Jan, what's going on? - An executive meeting. - And? - They tore a strip off him. - Really? What for? The usual. Get it? No change then? He's staying? - Yeah, sure. - Did they mention us? - Yes, your name came up. - What have they got on me? How far are we from the factory? About a mile. To be exact: - 1 .4 miles. - Thank you. Will all that be cut down? Yes, those trees are dead. How far away are we really? - Over two miles. - My God! Two miles! It's a great opportunity for the region. The funds aren't only for the factory. Local culture will benefit too. The factory will providejobs, daily bread. At the same time we'll build new neighborhoods, swimming pools, tennis courts, even a theater. Is it a Nagra? Yes. A top recorder, huh? We can change people's lives for the better. Hear that? Yes. Well? I want to do a follow-up. Do one about Kudelski. He's a real success story. We're a colossus. It's an easy subject. Am I a difficult subject? In your view, am I good or bad? It's not so simple. I've had that tape for six years. I want to see how it comes across today and how it evolves. What did your uncle die of? He'd always had a weak heart. Give me some time. Call me next week. Okay? Okay. Like to hear your boss's voice? We must improve... I'll tell him. Is the hotel fixed? ...change. I am happy to tackle this task... Stop being silly! Stefan! There you are. You didn't say you were coming. Hello, my dear director. Lech has shown me the basics. - Over to you. - Fine. This way, Minister. We'll come down to join you. It looks good from up here. It all depends on the men. As you see, we're coping. My three young engineers are better than the French. I hear you've made a clean sweep. Yes. What about the forest? It's shrinking. You wanted to speak to me? I thought you wanted to speak to me. I want to leave here. Is this off the record? We haven't done all we wanted here. I haven't either. I think a mistake was made early on. I don't want to make it worse. And I don't want to lie. Do you feel at fault? No. I feel a fool. You're very hard. I have to respect the principles. What do we tell people who have staked their careers on the factory and production? That's just it. I don't want to have to tell them. Don't you care about your career? No. I'm worn out. Do you accept my resignation? No. See the job through with your initial enthusiasm. Why does it happen like that? It's always the way. The truth won't get you very far. You always lose out with the truth. What you're going to say... The old saying: ''The truth will out'' isn't always true. There are things a director doesn't know, information that doesn't reach him. It gets lost on the way. Nothing gets to him, and he can't cope. The problem isn't people withholding information. It's more widespread. The workers must be able to speak up, to say what they really think. Turn that off. What? Stop the camera. - But... - I'm with the management. Come this way. Yes? Are you from television? May I see your card? Here. Go ahead. Thank you. Do you have permission? The director agreed... No, that was a general agreement. I'm the person to see about the details. I have a list of skilled people who I can authorize you to interview... So I can't talk to them? You could put it that way. I just want to listen to this tape. - It's never... - I'm sorry... - So are we. - You must leave the factory. Right? Go back to work. You won't let us talk? It's not that...just not now. Sir... The journalist for you. Galecki. Shall I type that? No. Is he calling from Warsaw? No, he's downstairs. Insinuate that I'm here but that I don't want to talk to him. Still smoking? - I knew you'd find me. - Hello, sir. Come in. - Go ahead. - Please. Three days ago, I was thrown out of the factory. Yes, that's his style. Want to go out? Do go in. I'llJust let him out. Excuse me. Come on, come on! See how he jumps! Come on. Sit. Sit! What's this picture? I took it. - Like it? - Yes, it's great. She was my uncle's lodger during the occupation. That must be me in the picture. I had curly hair. What about your program? - Sorry? - Your program? My documentary? I wanted to call you to talk about it, but I couldn't get through to you. Are you surprised I won't discuss it? I'm afraid of people who oppose me over a difference of opinion. Can I help? Yes, I'll hold it... The other day in your office, you didn't seem frightened. I thought you'd agreed. We all have our moments of weakness. Your film will be against me, my methods or the factory. I had something more ambiguous in mind. Not some shallow, one-sided piece. A film about you, as you are, as I see you... - Right now? - Yes. Can you take that in? I'll be right there. - In here? - Yes. Let's drink to my health. And to mine. So you were saying... You see, I have the impression that the people here don't feel like owners. They fight you, they fail, everything gets on top of them. It's not about bathrooms. They can refuse improvements, prefer the old ways... You know what killed my uncle? It wasn't his heart. He died of loyalty to an ideal. He was fighting, going from bad to worse, and his heart gave out. Actually, I shouldn't tell you this, but he was the one who wrote that slogan. It was? All on his own? - At night? - Yes. He took a brush and painted it. Crazy, huh? Yes. I think one day people will start saying that their houses, factory, town and country are all theirs, but everything is different. Not necessarily worse. Do they want to turn the clock back? One can get used to anything. Tell that to the farmers whose crops fail, who stand in line for every sack of fertilizer that I produce. They're the majority. It works in their favor. You're tired. We're all tired. Listen. The people you're defending are all asleep. It's late. Do you believe I'm working against them? But why... Why don't the people here, the wisest ones, want to participate in the decisions? They chose this place. So did your uncle. Did you participate in those decisions? Yes. Is your conscience at peace? Not entirely. EVENTS AT GDANSK You know about it? I heard it on the radio. What can we do? If you need any help, you can count on me. All we can have is a quiet conscience. Going to the factory? Yes. Get in. Mr. Bednarz. Are there any journalists here? No, just the film crew from the Hygiene Committee. Get them out! We're going down to see them. You wanted to talk to me. Very well. Here I am. Now listen. I'll be open with you. We all know the situation the country is in. I want you to know that I think like you do. I'm on your side. But do realize that we must act wisely. Not rashly. PAL T-4? Yes? Crappy technique.! Stefan, for heaven's sake! What are you doing? You know we must stick to the program. The minister's here, and lots of VI Ps. It must all go according to plan. They don't like changes. You know the score. The flowers are ready. Are you moving in here? Here? My office is just the same. They're all the same. Yes, I suppose so. Have a drink?

As we may not meet again, I wanted to say good-bye and thank you for everything. At least you're realistic. Aren't you? I hope you... I haven't messed things up these last years. You're starting off on a firm foundation. - Good luck. - Thank you. Mr. Bednarz, your books are here. Yes, thank you. Come on... walk. I say walk on your own. All by yourself. Come on, come on...
