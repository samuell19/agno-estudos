[Massimiliano Allegri] The more pressure you're under, the more fun you have. And then wanting to prove that you're always the best. That is what makes the difference, in the end. [Allegri] Mentally, it's not a matter of technique, it's a matter of head. This is what makes the difference, the desire to improve every day. [Allegri] Let's pass the ball, let's play Napoli! Let's pass. Guys, they do three things when they attack. [Allegri] They move like a triangle. Insigne gets inside. Hamsik throws himself in, Mertens comes out... to form the triangle. You've got to break into the triangle. [Allegri] It is an important match. We need to enter this game as a great team, the usual way Juventus does, and having big respect for Napoli. [theme music playing] [narrator] As December begins and the winter cold embraces Turin, Italy, the battle for the Scudetto is heating up, with Juventus in the unfamiliar position in third place and trailing rival Napoli by four points. They are also in danger of being eliminated in the Champions League. They will face Olympiacos for final group match, in Greece. Barely halfway through the season and Juve are already facing critical matches with possible season long implications. No bigger than tomorrow's game, when they travel to Naples for the most anticipated Serie A game of the season. [Paolo Tomaselli] Juventus cannot let Napoli run away in the standings. With a Napoli vicotry, Juve would trail by seven points. [Tomaselli] So, for Juve, it is a big deal. The upcoming schedule, with games against Inter, Olympiacos and then Roma... It's a pivotal December. Napoli is doing something extraordinary, because it's won 12 games and tied only two. So tomorrow we are facing a team that in this moment is traveling faster than us. It deserves its spot in the rankings and absolutely deserves to be the league's favorite. The best defense usually wins the league. This year we may not have the best defense, but let's hope to win it anyway. [Allegri] Everybody hopes that Juventus loses, and that some other team wins the Scudetto. This only increases our desire to win our seventh straight. Have a good day. [Giovanni Guardalà] For the city of Naples and for its fans, Juve has always been the enemy that must be defeated at any cost. If you go to San Paolo when Juventus is visiting, you can hear a deafening noise. Especially last year, when Higuain returned to Napoli for the first time. Even during warm-ups, you could feel something extraordinary. [narrator] The long-standing rivalry between North and South has fuelled deep animosity among the two regions. That tension extends onto the soccer field and it's crystalized in the image of one man. Gonzalo Higuain transferred from Napoli to Juve over a year ago, but the southerners are not quite over it. [merchant] Right now you are in a world-famous street known as the street of nativities. Since we, Neapolitan people, love football players, they feature in the Christmas nativity too. [merchant] So, we have Maradona, Mertens, Higuain... For the way he treated Napoli fans, two horns grew on his forehead. Going back to Naples is always a special situation for me. Napoli's supporters are free to say whatever they want about my leaving the team. But regardless from how I am treated in Naples, I will never stop praising Napoli. [man] There are high expectations for tonight's game, because we could increase our lead. It's not just the seven points, it's also seven months of mocking Juventus fans. That's why the game is so important. For us, this is like a World Cup final. [commentator] The month of December starts with a big game, Napoli-Juventus. The Bianconeri are chasing, four points behind Sarri's team, which is still undefeated. Let's go. And we're off. Enjoy Napoli-Juventus. It's the 15th day of the Serie A championship. Pjanic... ...passes the ball to Matuidi, number 14. He shoots, but Albiol stops it. Napoli shoots, but here's Buffon. Watch out for the number nine, wide for Douglas Costa, Douglas Costa to the middle, watch out! Reina closes the goal for Gonzalo Higuain. Dybala, wide for Higuain. Higuain, watch out! Higuain! Gonzalo Higuain! Juventus is ahead at the 12th minute. Changes the score, once again it's him, once again! Five goals in five games versus Napoli, over two seasons! Perfect play, a sniper, close to the goal, Higuain! Napoli zero, Juventus one. Douglas Costa once again, Higuain! But it's deflected. It was a great play. Higuain wanted the ball earlier, but Costa waited too long. [narrator] With first place on the line and Higuain as a catalyst, it's inevitable that emotions run hot. [commentator] In the meantime a fight started between Higuain and Mertens. And now one between Dybala and Koulibaly. [narrator] The realization that the powerful northern team could once again prevail in the south is almost too much to bear. [commentator] A header! Buffon, once again! Then Albiol kicks it out. It's a mistake. Watch out for Insigne. Buffon stretches out. Gianluigi Buffon says "no" to Lorenzo Insigne. It's over! Juventus cleans out the San Paolo stadium in Naples. Higuain's goal decided the game. A very hard to swallow defeat! [Higuain] I will always be grateful to Napoli. I improved so much as a player there. It's because I was in Napoli that Juventus saw me and acquired me. And now Juve and its fans embraced me. [Higuain] This is the first Christmas I am spending in Turin. It's an important holiday. For the first time, I am going to spend it far from my family. [Higuain] This is an extra sacrifice that soccer brings. When I was a kid, I loved to meet the players of the first team, they had been playing for a long time and it was great to see them up close. Now we are going to Vinovo, to visit the Juniors sector. [Higuain] It is for the enjoyment of the kids. [children] We've come all this way To see Higuain play [Stefano Braghin] As every year, we celebrate Christmas. It is an opportunity for our kids to meet the first team players, to greet them, get autographs, and get to know each other. [Braghin] This is one big family where adults and kids share the same passion. [child] Dybala, is it true you are a lefty? [Dybala] Yes, it is! -[child] Me, too! -[child #2] Me also! -[child] Higuain! -[Higuain] Hey, how are you? [Higuain] My dad gave me some advice when I was 18 and Real Madrid signed me: Not to fear anybody, and to treat people with respect because they have two legs, two hands, two eyes, one nose. [Higuain] They're the same as you, and to learn a lot, but to go with no fear, because if you go with fear, you won't win. Oooh! This is advice I would give to the young players. Be a learner, be humble, be aware that we are all the same. [child] Do you like being a referee? [Higuain] No, it's better to be a player. [Higuain] Bye, kids! [children clamoring] Ciao. [trainer] You already know the program for today, no? Let's start. We'll work on strength after the warm up with Enrico. I'm asking you to do quality work. Like there are no weights. You do some pelvis extensions, and you loosen the arms. Make sure to keep your head down so you don't strain your neck. [Folletti] We tailor the workout depending on the characteristics of each individual to work on all aspects, both metabolic and strength and on their personal history. Keep legs, hips and shoulders aligned. Stay down three seconds, but keeping your bottom up. [Folletti] Ready? Go! Fast, fast, push 100%! Go! Yes! Two... one. [narrator] For the Juventus staff, injuries are a recurring issue of the long soccer season and being that in Italy the game is never played indoors, physical training is one of the techniques used to keep the team healthy during the cold winter months. There is also science, technology, and trade secrets. [Vittorio Ferrino] We have to create the perfect conditions for the field, whatever the weather is. During wintertime, we have a circuit of water and glycol under the soil. [Ferrino] So our fields are always green. [Folletti] Push hard! That's the goal! [Folletti] Try to be more aggressive! Three! One! The players' cleats destroy the field, it's always a difficult task to fix it. [Ferrino] This isn't just a job, it takes passion. Expectations and pressure are high. Working next to Marchisio was great. -[Marchisio] You pushed today. -Marchisio was very fast today, I felt my heart in my throat. Claudietto Marchisio killed me today. Look how in shape you are, you look great. I'm doing well, so I hope that this moment will last throughout the season. [narrator] The splashiest signing from Juve's offseason was Federico Bernardeschi. The young winger, who had shone with Fiorentina, was signed by Juventus for 40 million euros. [strumming and picking guitar] [instructor] E minor and G major. -You can play all the strings together. -[Bernardeschi] Okay. [Bernardeschi] The best advice I was ever given was... you must never lose the fun you felt as a child. Come, sweetie. Come here! You're too small, let me help you. [Bernardeschi] Since friends can't always come visit you they are sort of my best friends. [Bernardeschi] They help me pass the time and we share both the good and bad moments that happen in football. This is the kitchen... with him as well. This is not my field. I am worthless in the kitchen. These are the marble chess pieces that my father gave me for Christmas. And they come from my city, Carrara. [Bernardeschi] Black and white are colors that belong to me now. [Bernardeschi] Playing for Juve... ...is everybody's dream, when they are kids. Especially for those who fall in love with football. [Bernardeschi] When I received the offer this summer, I saw it as an important chance to grow professionally, a big leap forward in my career. I knew I was coming to a winning team, and I want to win, right? [narrator] Juve's Champions League season resumes with a journey to Athens, to face Olympiacos. [Pavel Nedved] We are going to Athens where we are going to play against Olympiacos. It's a very important match. Their supporters are very passionate and the team rarely loses at home. [Nedved] Therefore, we have to be careful and stay focused. But Juventus knows what to do, we were born for these kind of matches. I am very confident. [narrator] But before the match, coach Max Allegri makes a surprising announcement. The only doubt I have is Buffon as a starter tomorrow. We'll evaluate it today, but it's unlikely. Yes, Buffon and Chiellini will both sit. Chiellini's not too unwell. He has gastroenteritis, so he should get well soon. Buffon's calf is bothering him. He definitely won't play this match. Szczesny will play, and let's not forget that he is absolutely a first-team goalkeeper. [narrator] In a match that Juve has no choice but to win, Szczesny will play instead of Buffon. It will be his first appearance in a Champions League game with Bianconeri. Many Juve supporters wonder if they may be witnessing the end of the Buffon era. [commentator] And we're off! Enjoy the game. Olympiacos versus Juventus. The same day of the Group D. Movement between the lines. Douglas Costa. Wide on the left for De Sciglio. Ball to the middle for Dybala, watch out! Dybala! De Sciglio for Dybala, maybe with a dribbling more... Benatia. Matuidi. Left passage for Alex Sandro, good idea! Alex Sandro to the center. Alex Sandro, Cuadrado! Juventus takes the lead! At the 15th minute the game changes. Olympiacos zero,  Juventus one. Juan Cuadrado! Juventus' offensive transition was perfect. Assist by Alex Sandro, and Cuadrado was excellent. Long cross to the middle, header, watch out. Szczesny! Miracle by Szczesny! Amazing save on the first goalpost. [narrator] Szczesny, Buffon's potential heir, seems to know the tricks of his trade just as well. [commentator] Marin! Szczesny is still there, but it's not over. Marin again...Szczesny! Once again... Juve is clearly suffering in this first part of the second half. Szczesny essential in more than one occasion. Opening for Koutris, he wants to cross. [narrator] The near miss inspires Allegri to make a key substitution. The young Bernardeschi will now lead the attack. [commentator] Khedira wide for Bernardeschi, he wants to create something. Bernardeschi again on his left foot... Watch out! Miraculous save by Proto! Higuain passes it outside for Khedira. Wide again for Bernardeschi. Bernardeschi! Juventus doubles down, and scores once again in Champions League. Bernardeschi has a great impact on the match. [Bernardeschi] I'm happy that we were able to qualify with this tough match, on a tough pitch. So we proved once again that we are a great team. [Bernardeschi] And in this game I also achieved a personal result, so I'm really happy about that, too. Then we can always improve in our everyday in many ways, that way we'll be able to reach great results. Winning requires continuous sacrifices and a lot of humility. So we know that we need to win against Inter on Saturday, and it won't be easy. [Bernardeschi] But we are playing at home, so we'll try to win those three points. [narrator] Advancing to the champions round for 16 was the first major goal for this team. The accomplishment enables some less stressful moments. Deep in the players contracts is a line about appearing in the company Christmas film, a project more about fun than art. I can't... I can't even lift my arms! Things are getting complicated here... yes they are. He threw it that way. How can I reach up there? He is too small, don't throw it so high for him! Somebody comes at the door and shows a present, somebody came to visit you. So at a certain point while you are celebrating, you look at the door. Action! Merry Christmas! [director] Ding dog! Somebody is at the door! [Higuain] Who is it? [director] Okay, cut! Lastly... [director] You are the surprise guest who comes for dinner, while the guys are all at the table already. The camera is there, and you enter the house smiling. I start from here? Yes, it would be nice if you could be like, "Surprise, I'm here." -[director] Yes? -I smile outside and then I enter? -[director] Yes. -[Buffon] Okay. And... action! And... action! Okay, cut. Perfect. -[Buffon] Okay? -Done. Thank you so much. -[Buffon] Thanks, ciao! -[director] Ciao! [narrator] The once unfathomable prospect of Gianluigi Buffon hanging up his cleats is now being debated in every corner of Italy. It would almost be insulting for Buffon to come back next season... ...and realize after a few months he's not the Gigi Buffon he once was. Not being fit enough, maybe even begging for playing time. Maybe begging is too much to say... I don't think that will ever happen. Because Buffon is smart enough to understand and to know himself, and when to call it quits. He said it himself: "I'll throw in the towel when I'm unable to be at the top of my game." Elite athletes only give the best of themselves. My dream is for Buffon to play one more year. I'd be so sorry if his career ended with Italy being ousted from the World Cup. I don't want that to be a legend's final chapter. [narrator] If this is the final chapter for Buffon, it's also the prologue for Wojciech Szczesny's Juve career. He's considered to be a great goalkeeper but filling a legend's shoes is a near impossible task. I believe that Buffon is one of the strongest in history. So we all hope that Szczesny will be able to follow in his footsteps. He is a great goalkeeper, but it's clear that what happens on the field will provide the final judgement. [Claudio Filippi] Szczesny plays less than Buffon. But he could be the starter on practically any other European team. [Filippi] We believe he's one of the greatest goalies in the world. [narrator] Another key component in the continued growth of Juve's defense is twenty-three -year-old Daniele Rugani A night out shopping with his girlfriend doesn't mean he isn't thinking about his teammates. For Barzagli, I would get a nice bottle of wine. I know he loves good wine. For Chiellini, a nice book, because I often see him reading, and I'm sure he'd appreciate it. -[fan] Can I take a picture with you? -[Rugani] Sure! -[Rugani] Are you jealous? -No, of course I am not jealous! -[man] No, let her do it. -[girlfriend] You do it? [girlfriend] Like that it's perfect. For sure, being recognized and feeling affection outside the stadium like tonight here is something very beautiful. We more or less agree on everything. It's a moment of joy. I'm proud of him and proud to be his girlfriend. Oh, wow, that's better! [Rugani] In the past years it's been difficult to spend time with my family and loved ones. Christmas is an occasion to get together. When it comes, I am really happy. Perfect! Do you like it? Gone! We'll buy it. [narrator] December is easily Juve's most challenging month in Serie A. Ahead of Juve and Napoli, now Inter Milan is at the top of the standings. Spalletti's Nerazzurri arrive at Allianz Stadium safe in the knowledge of being the only undefeated team. It's a rare thing that two weeks in a row you play against the league leaders. Last week, Napoli; this week, Inter. The championship is clearly on the line. [narrator] This fight for first place is very important for Juve's fans, who flock to Allianz Stadium. Among them, Miralem Pjanic's family. Tonight we play Inter. We came here to the stadium with Edin, and Fahrudin, Miralem's dad. [Josepha] It's important for the family to be here for support. [narrator] Turin and Milan are only 140km apart, so this rivalry known as the Derby d'Italia is always an intense affair. This year it features two of the best defenses in the league. For Juve's starters, there will be additional pressure, given Allegri's decision not to start with Paulo Dybala, who after a red-hot start to the season has scored only once the past eight games. [commentator] And we're off. Come on, guys! Watch out! Deflection... He is alone, he kicks! Handanovic! A header towards the empty goal! A miraculous save! All three sprint, Cuadrado proceeds alone. He's down! It's a free kick in a good position for us. Great position. Good job, Cuadrado. We already said it, he's a player capable of dribbling players as well. He looks for the right position for the kick. Asamoah is close to him. One... two... three... four players in the barrier, plus one of our own. Watch out for the hit. Miralem aims. The crowd allows him to concentrate. Here goes Pjanic... He was aiming for the post, but the ball goes out on the right of Andanovic. Chiellini goes to the middle. Watch out! The ball is there, a miracle by Handanovic, but now the game stops. Cuadrado sends it in the middle for Mandzukitch. On the far goal... it hits the crossbeam! Shocking! Headshot by Mandzukitch. Gonzalo... he dribbles well, he's at the edge. Gonzalo... left, right... Resisted! Handanovich saves it in the middle. Another chance for Juve. Header in front of the goalkeeper... Handanovic! Dybala took off his sweater and is walking into his temple, the Allianz Stadium. He's going to change the game. [narrator] At the 80th minute of the scoreless game, Max Allegri finally lets in his best player. [Allegri] I always say that there are many games within a game. And in the last 20 minutes, the matches overturn and swapping players become decisive. [commentator] Dybala, being left-footed, takes the free kick from that side. Here's the referee's whistle. Trying to get back in, Dybala. Deflected. Juan has the ball. Double step over. Cuadrado for Dybala. Dybala! He loses the ball. Come on, Paolino! [Allegri] Every time a player comes in from the bench and he is ineffective, the team suffers damage. [Allegri] He's like a little puppy! I think we were the best team on the field. It's a shame we didn't win, it was an important game against a team who knows how to defend well. [Pjanic] Maybe Paulo needed to rest, to stay serene, It's not easy when he is always the center of attention, and everybody expects so much from him. But I am not worried, he is very professional and he'll do as good as he did earlier this season. [narrator] For at least one Juventus player, the disappointment of the draw is tempered by the approval of his biggest fan. As the team begins to prepare for the second half of the season, there is a sense of accomplishment. They've gone undefeated in the month of December, conceding only a single goal in the final seven games. [Pjanic] We are in a good phase. We won in Naples, which is never simple, we moved to the next round in the Champions League, which is an important thing, and now we will also prepare for Tottenham, in February. So it was a very important month for us, but it's not over, we have to keep going. [Moreno Torricelli] Juventus starts every year believing they will win. When you get here and wear this jersey, you know you have to win. But you don't have to win just one or two games, you have to get to the end of the season writing Juventus' name on the championship cup. [Roberto Bettega] The philosophy of this team, of this family, is of trying to win. We were pieces, moments of this life. [Bettega] But Juventus' secret isn't us, but the continuity of the ownership. [narrator] The decades of camaraderie are evident at the annual Christmas dinner. While the celebration has become a tradition for the entire Juventus family, this year somehow feels different. The first team please, if you can get closer to us. [Agnelli] Let's give a hand for our guys. [applause] [Agnelli] Italian football has often made history, with Juve's Golden Five Year Period or the great Torino. [Agnelli] But also with this Juventus. This team has achieved even more and has become truly legendary by winning six straight Scudetti. We have suffered two painful losses. We're aware of it, our horizons have to broaden. We want to win in Europe, it must be our goal. I am convinced that the extraordinary people in this room will carry us to our goals. Victory in Italy and in Europe. [Agnelli] Until the end. [narrator] Before this team can conquer Europe, they'll face a surging Tottenham squad in London. As Juventus presses forward to the most important part of the season, they are guided by their history and fueled by their tradition. But this season's challenges feel like uncharted territory meaning the path "To The End" is less certain than ever.
