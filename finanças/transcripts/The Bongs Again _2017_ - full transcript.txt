Aren't you ready? Will miss the appointment. It's almost 9.30. You're being immature. It's the Royal College of Arts! The Dean's agreed to meet you. It's a chance of a lifetime. Now, why are you here, Oly? To check things out … about your Phd. You're lucky to get an appointment with the Dean here in London. If all goes well you might join from next semester. If you don't go it's going to look very bad. They know you're here, I spoke to them yesterday. If this wasn't important, you could've come here after marriage. You've seriously come here to look for your dad? One of the reasons. After marriage, in December, you could've done that. It's not easy to get the Dean's appointment. Your Runu aunt's husband is going to Manchester tomorrow. Will return after 3 months. You seriously believe Runu aunt's husband is your dad? Well he's also Deepak. Came to London in 1980's. He's also from Jadavpur University. Studied together so many years. Fall in love … I come here slog my ass off to get where I've got. I get this house for us. You wait in Calcutta for 3 years … … Your mother allows you to come here to check things out. And then you tell me you want to look for your dad! Your primary objective in life is to look for the blooming a♪♪hole … … Who deserted you when you were a one year old! -I'd told you before. -No, you didn't, Oly! On the way here very casually on the plane you tell me that … … You also want to look for your dad. Who perhaps happens to be in London! On the f♪♪♪ing plane! Oh, you're Ani right? Yeah, Anindyo. Dad's taking a shower. Come on in. -You guys want some ice cream? -No, thanks. -Like some eggplant fritters? -No, thanks. Milo, stop making so much noise! Let me call him. So, how come you guys are looking for my dad? Well, … she's Oly. She, perhaps is a relative of your dad … so. We're just trying to check it out. What do you mean by 'relative'? As in 'real' relative? I'm waiting outside. Oly! Oly! Why did you walk out? She's making fritters for you. I don't want to eat fritters. Why did you come out? I don't think he's my dad! Why? Because he's married again? No... such a grown up daughter? So what? Might not be his. The Dad's here! Looking for me? My wife said there's a girl from Kolkata looking for me. -Ya … that's her, Oly. -Hello! She's looking for a relative of hers … … Who studied in Jadavpur Univ, Calcutta. -English Department 19 … -1972. I was in engineering. I don't know anyone in the English Department. We're really sorry. Thank you. Let's go. I think I can help you. There's a guy I know. He was also in Jadavpur Univ. And also from the 70's batch. His name is also Deepak. Meet my lovely wife Martha. Martha, they're getting married. He's a financial consultant. She's here to look for her father's friend. She's brought this picture where her father's friend is missing. And guess what! His name is also Deepak! -Must be really hot in India now. -Yes, it is. -Take one of these. -No, I'm good. Thank you. Did you get to meet your father's friend? No, not yet. -Do you want another beer? -I'm not done with this. C'mon, it's only a small bottle. -I wouldn't mind one. -That's my boy! -How long since you migrated? -Four years. I'll get you both one. -Was it Dr. Deepak who told you about me? -Yes. I took Martha to Kolkata last time … … She had the most amazing time. I know a guy called Jerry. He might be able to help you. He's a Bengali, came to London in the 1980's. He plays guitar … … Sometimes comes over to my friend's house … … Plays rock'n'roll, bluegrass, stuff like that. He might be able to help you to find your father's friend. He works in a bar called 'The Lincoln'. -The Lincoln? -In Soho. -Hi! -Hello! -Hans. -Hi Hans, I'm Pantos. -From? -Sweden. And you? -I'm from Berlin. -Okay. Berlin … very nice! But actually am half Bangla. Half Bangla? My mom is Bangla. Hello! -Hey, I'm Sarah. Nice to meet you. -I'm Hans. -My mom's also Bangla. -Really! Yeah. It's a long story, but that's awesome! -So, your dad's from Berlin, right? -Berlin. You know Darjeeling? -I'll be going. -Oh great! And you … America? No, I'm from England. I'm British. You know Bolpur? Bolpur … Rabi Tagore place! You know Rabi Tagore? Ya … I don't know where that is. It's only 5000. Bolpur. To Bolpur? You wanna go Bolpur? Fifty fifty? No. I have a lot of work here. I'm here for some work. So I can't leave this place. It could be two-three. Two thousand yours. Three thousand mine. No, actually I'd love to come, but I've a lot of work to do. For now bye. Bye guys. Do you have a cigarette on you? Oh sure! Can I just borrow one from you? Actually you're not supposed to smoke here. I'll smoke later. Thank you so much. And you have fun in Bolpur. -Great meeting you. -Nice to meet you. Hi Sarah! -Hi! How're you doing today? -I'm good. -Please, have a seat. -Thanks. I haven't been able to locate your mother. Last what I heard, she was working in a hospital. But …that was 5 years back! Mala Samanta is untraceable. So … what do we do now? We keep looking. I'm so sorry. This is my friend, Jishu Sen. -Hi! Sarah. Nice to meet you. -Jishu. He's giving us a ride to this orphanage where your mom may've … Okay … I don't know if she's still there but... -… It's worth a shot … -Of course … thank you so much. -Sujan told me about you. -About me? That you've come from London. You're looking for your mom … … Who had given you to an orphanage. -So, where are we going now? -To the orphanage. So Sarah, don't take this personally … You don't seem to have a British accent. Really! May be I just grew up with a lot of Indians. The time you're talking of I wasn't here. So I don't know. But our record shows she was here. A girl here knows her. Stays here. She's gone out. Will come soon. -You can wait here. -Okay, I'll wait. -You can wait in the office too. -I'm fine. I'll sit here. When were you adopted? I was almost one. -Parents are English? -Yeah, in London. I'll sit here. Thank you so much. Hey! How are you? Sarah, I've got some work nearby. I'll head out. I've to head back to the passport office as well … … So I guess, Jishu will escort you back. I really appreciate everything you're doing for me. -Thanks a lot. -Please don't mention. It's a pity that corporation doesn't have any peoples' records. -Otherwise this might've been easy. -You're right. -Thanks a lot. -No problem. -See you. -Bye. -Good luck. -Bye. Take care. I'm really thankful for all the things you're doing for me. It's my pleasure. So, did you get any lead? Not really. She said she has some information. But I'm not too sure. Let's see where it goes. Okay. Alright. So … you live here? Ya, I live here. I have a business of my own. -What kind of business? -Garments and clothes. Fancy. Nice. Sujan was telling me you've rented an apartment somewhere. Ya. It's an Airbnb. It's convenient. In Taltala. Yes, I knew her. She talked about you. Quite often. "I have a daughter." Her husband wasn't good. I mean … your dad. He used to create trouble. That's why, she couldn't keep you with her. So, you were sent to an orphanage. She couldn't work here for long. Went to her native village Midnapur often. Was unwell too. Didn't have medicines. Didn't have much money either. She worked at a doctor's house before working here. Doctor Subir Dutta. That's all I know, dear. You want to go home or should I take you somewhere? Where? I don't know if I should be saying this or not, but … … You can't change what has happened. Right? She was sick. If you meet her she might not even recognise you. Sujan was telling me … … For the last 10 days you've been looking for her. You can't find someone so suddenly. I know. I suggest that you relax. Ya. I'm relaxed. Don't worry. Come, let's go to a fun place. Where? My cousin is getting married. Have you seen a Bengali wedding? Bamboo? Who's causing problems? Bamboos for the marquee? They've done the structure. They're rehearsing a dance number. It's ok. Jishu will … Talk of the devil! O no … not devil! The great Jishu is physically here now. And he has a very attractive young lady in tow. So, hanging up now. -So? -All well? Yes, absolutely! And you're? She's Sarah. She's from UK. -Hello Sarah! -Hello. You're travelling in India? No, she's here for work. You speak Bengali? I can understand Bengali. My dad is Assamese. So I can understand little, but speak very little. By the way, he is my paternal uncle. Bobby's father. And my father's brother. He's a pro … Oh great! His tee shirt … says it all. Delhi School of Economics … okay. Why are you picking on my tee shirt? What do you think? You guys can only be waist? Waist? Hip, dude, hip! Please! -Today is your son's reception. -So? Instead of a half pant and a tee … … You could've worn at least a kurta and jeans. Look, I'm the quintessential multicultural Bengali. Bengalis are in everything. In traditional weddings … … In Durga pujas … … Very much in Tagore's songs … … And in Holi … … In Eid … … In religion, Christmas, and what have you. What's your point? -Why are they into so many things? -Why? They've nothing much to do. Wait, I'm a little confused here … … Are you for this multicultural thing or against it? I'm not against anything. All I'm saying is that one has to … … Recognise one's roots. Cut down your vodka … Hi professor! Smoke less. You're ageing. You take less bribe and think of your country. And why're you hanging around me with this dhoti? Shall I drape it round your neck? You wear the dhoti … Take the keys. Give it to your daughter-in-law. Had my sister been alive she would've done all these. Keys to my daughter-in-law! First vodka, then lunch, then keys. No, first keys then lunch. Okay, let's ask somebody who's neutral. -What do you think? -About what? Should I give the new bride the keys first … … Or should she feed us lunch first? I'm really starving now, so lunch would be a good idea. See, I'm always right. By the way, this is my brother-in-law … -Hello! Namaste. -Hello! I'm Pradeep Sarkar. He works for the 'sarkar'. 'Sarkar' means the Indian government. You take uncle inside. Let's see what's happening inside. Listen, listen! I've an announcement to make. Our friend Anindyo has a surprise for us. He's getting married to a Bengali girl from Calcutta. Cheers! The wedding's in December. But, she's already come here to check things out. She's very talented. She can sing very well. Ladies and gentlemen … Olypriya Dasgupta! Let's hear a 'baul' song. No no, something contemporary. How about Shreya Ghoshal? Not today, please! You're a new bride. Got to perform something. I'm nobody's bride yet! You'll soon be. Olypriya, you've come to London to check things out. What did you check about Anindyo? I'm not here to check out anything. I've come here to look for my dad. Anindyo's my childhood friend. I've been searching desperately for my dad for the last few days. Am I clear? Deepak Dasgupta. Graduated from Jadavpur Univ. in 1972. Came to London in 1980. If you have any news, please let us know. I'll be grateful to you. Thank you for the drink. Shall we leave? I hope you're okay. Ya, I'm good. -So, do we meet again? -Ya, sure! Why not? I'll be happy to show you around … Kolkata. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. I know it's difficult to find someone with limited information. But let's give it a shot. Ya. That woman said about Dr. Dutta. She used to work there. We can start from there. Do you have any idea how many Dr. Duttas are in this city? No, why? Don't worry … I'll try and get some information. This my number. My card. Feel free to call me anytime. Sure. Okay. Thanks a lot. Bye. Take care. I can only have a ten minute lunch break. And I'll show you Trafalgar Square on Saturday … I'm not here to see Trafalgar Square! You've come to look for your dad, right? No, as your friend Indranil said, I've come to check you out. What's your problem? Then what is your identity? -Be realistic for a while. -I am being realistic. You are? Who's more important in your life now? Me or your unknown dad? God! Knew you'd ask me this. So am asking! -No, don't ask. -I need to know. Why? Is this a competition? To meet my dad was a childhood dream. So many questions in my mind. Why did he leave not thinking of us? He could've at least thought about me. Many lose their dads in their childhood. But this is not being dead. I just don't know this man. And which daughter doesn't want to know her father? Collected as much information as I could without telling mom. Through friends. Friends of friends, relatives, through facebook. First heard he's teaching in London University. Then learnt he's in Paris. And now I hear he's again in London! And … I'm here too! And if he's not dead I'll probably get to see him. How can I sing in the midst of all this? This just doesn't make any sense to me. A person ran away deserting you and your mom … … You're going half way round the world for him! And another guy, who's waited all these years … … Slogged his a♪♪ off to get a house. It's not easy to get a house in London. He wants to give you a home, a life … and you don't care! -Who said I don't care? -No, you don't care! You've changed a lot in the past 3 years I wasn't in Calcutta. You mean my search is a sudden whim? I don't know. I really don't know. You spoke about him a couple of times in University. -A couple of times? -Yes, of course! -You've known about it all along! -No, I haven't! You wanted to look for him. But this is mania! -You think it's mania? -Of course! I just don't get you. Back in Calcutta, so many times we've made love in your room. And it has been 6 days you're here! We're in the same house, same room. Sharing the same bed... Ani! Cool down. I'm sorry! It's up to you how you spend your life. I know how to spend mine. I've made my choice. Decide and let me know. Ya, mom. I went to this awesome Bengali wedding. It was crazy. Ya, I'll do that. I'll talk to my landlady about this. Let's see what she says. Don't call me landlady. Call me aunt. I'm going to the market. Ask Ratan to serve you tea. Sure. Thank you so much. And, don't say landlady. No, she's my aunty. She said she made me tea. Very sweet of her. Alright mom, bye. Love you too. Madam sorry. Sorry. -Who are you? -I'm Nitai. From Bolpur. -You're Hans, right? -No, Nitai. -You're from Berlin, right? -No, Bolpur. Why're you here? -I'm a poor boy, madam. -Aunty, aunty! Stay away from me! -Don't shout, please! -My house, I'll shout. Why are you here? I'm very poor, madam. My mom will die. She's very sick. -Stone in stomach. She'll die. -What am I supposed to do? Pick it up! Keep it there. I'm very poor, madam. What am I supposed to do? Why are you here? You know Bengali. You're a Bengali, right? I understand Bengali, so? I know you're Bengali. The eatery boy Bhola said you're Bengali! What the f♪♪♪ you want from me? I need shelter, madam. This looks like a shelter home to you! For just Rs 500, I lied to some foreign tourists. You're a bloody conman! No, no … I'm a good man! -I'll call a friend. -One moment … Stay away from me! Whom are you calling? My mom's unwell. Stone in stomach. She'll die, madam. I'll also die. Bloody hell! Jishu … hi! There's a guy in my house. No, I don't know him. I met him in the morning. No. He's unarmed. He's just roaming around my house! Please come … fast. -Madam! -Stay away! Sit there. What do you want? -I'm confused. May I drink water? -No! I took Rs. 1,00,000 for my mother's operation. Now it's time to payback. To whom? Don, mafia … Southy! Saudi Arabia? No no, Indian! South Indian! Lower your voice. Softly speaking … They are cut-throats. I took Rs 1,00,000 from them. In exchange they gave me the stuff to sell. What stuff? Heroin. -You're a bloody drugdealer? -No no, I'm a good man! The Russians whacked all my stuff. -What is your problem? -My problem? Your mother's a maid. My mother's a maid too! We're like brother and sister. Who the f♪♪♪ told you that? The whole city knows. The eatery boy … I'll hit you with this. Shut up! Who told you that? The eatery boy said you're a Bengali! Your mom's a maid. Okay. Your mother's not a maid. You know Sister Nibedita? Who's sister? Sister Nibedita is just like you. Big heart! Gives shelter to all. I just need a shelter. Don't you understand that? Go to friend's house. Why in my house? -Water please! -No! It's my house, my water. You can't have anything. -Out... get out! -Sir … sir… Lemme go, Sir! Why did you enter a girl's room? She's my sister. Like Sister Nibedita. I'll never do it again, Sir! Told me he's from Berlin. But I said Bolpur too! That's now! -Scram! -Sorry sir. My sunglasses! Madam knows me … -Sarah, you have a lock? -I do. Then go and lock it. -Give me 100 bucks … -Scoot! I'd happily leave with 100 bucks … Mind the shoe! Ya mom … It's very weird in here. No, I'm good. Don't worry about me. It's just … no don't worry, I'm good. Ya, I got one lead. She used to work in some doctor's place. Ya, just thought as well! Let's see how it goes. And how's dad? Okay, I'll talk to you later. Love you too. Bye -Talking to your mom? -Ya. What time is it there? It'll be around 4pm. Will call my daughter. She's gone to London. Ratan, bring the food. Oh, you don't have to worry. I'll order home delivery. -The food's on the house. -Yes, I know. So, eat if you want or trash it. -No, no … I'll eat. -Here! Wow! It's lovely. If you fall sick eating street food … … Will that be good for you? You hardly trust our water filter! You're only on mineral water. -Water is something I just … -Eat. I'll have. I'm not very hungry right now. I know you're upset. You can't find your mom. Tell me … does life listen to our wishes? When my husband left me … … I was hardly 26. I was completely alone. But I took the challenge. I fought the world. I raised my daughter alone. Didn't allow this house to be sold. Sarah, I didn't want to stay alone … without my husband. -But I had to accept it. -Right. You also accept it. Accept this also … life is never what you want it to be. True! Are you alright? -Have your food. It'll get cold. -Okay. -Let me go and call up my daughter. -Sure, sure. -Good night! -Okay, good night! Hello! -Hi Sarah! -Ya, hi! Sorry for the delay. I got Dr. Dutta's number. That's awesome! So, where do we meet? We'll meet a little later. Gong home for some work. He's asked us to come tomorrow. We'll meet around 4pm. At the eatery. How long are you going to do this? How long are you going to do this? What's your point? Your visa will expire soon. And you want to extend your visa, but... … But then … there's no point, right? The reason you're here … … It's not leading you anywhere. In my place what would you've done? I wouldn't have come. What? Give me Dr. Dutta's address. I'll do it. It's okay. I don't want to waste your time. Correct. You're actually wasting my time. Texting Dr. Dutta's address to you. My business is suffering. And I'm not a guide. -What're you doing here? -Trying to help you out. Don't they in London? Not so easily. But this is India. People here help. Oly, I understand your situation perfectly. Look, we're a very little community here. They're here to build careers. To earn money. Imagine … if their kids were gay, or if … … Their daughters wanted to marry a black guy … … Do you think they'll accept it? They talk about work culture and democracy back there … … But here they all live in their little ghettos. Do you like it? Don't you have British friends? Ya, our neighbours. That's it. But, you studied so much … … Philosophy from Vishhwabharati. What happened to all that? That's a vacation for us! When London gets cold, we go to Shantiniketan to holiday. You're kidding! -Could you help me, please? -What? I need to go to Soho. I'll pay for your tube. Hope you know the time! It's hardly 6 pm. Come on! I need to meet someone. Soho is not at all safe at this point. Look I really need to meet this person. Do you think your dad will recognise you? Not dad. Somebody who can lead me to dad. Listen, I'm not going any further. You've got only 5 minutes. You better be quick! -Okay, fine! -Oly, I'm serious! -Don't worry. That blue door, right? -That's the one. -Can I help you? -I'll have a beer, please. Is there someone called Jerry here? He's the guy in white hat. Is he a Bengali? -What? -I mean Indian. All I know is he's crap. As soon as the big band's here, he's out. If you want to know about him, ask the guy in the black hat. That's Tom. Marie sweetheart, my Jameson. Hi! Are you Jerry? Ya, people call me that. You? I'm Oly from Kolkata, India. So, you're from Kolkata? I'm from North Calcutta. I still call the shots in Soho. -So they call it Kolkata nowadays? -Yes. Blessed be the Lord! Are you Bengali? Yup. Do you know this person? Why am I supposed to have known her? She's your friend's wife. Was your batchmate in Jadavpur Univ. Am I supposed to have done all that? Well, that's what they said. Jerry, I'm going to crap. Make it fast. Do you know Deepak Dasgupta? 1972 graduate. Jadavpur Univ. English department. Ya … I did bump into him a couple of times. Can you tell me where he is? Hard to say honey. He's travelling all the time. This is my address. Please connect if you get any information. I've come to London only to look for my dad. If you can help me out, I'd be grateful to you. Thank you. Leave my bag! F♪♪♪ off! Get lost. Thanks. Hey, are you okay? -Where were you? -Here. Let's go. Hi, is there somebody called Oly living here? Why? My friend Jerry will like to speak to her. He's at the back of the truck. Can she come out? Who are you? I'm Tom. Can she come out? Oly's not coming out. I guess we'll be moving in, right? You're going to take her with you? I just want to say, yesterday I was very rude with her. I didn't believe that she's Deepak's daughter. I know Deepak quite well … … Knew his wife too. Now, Deepak happens to have a friend who has a beach house … … In Kent. Where we're planning to go. So I thought may be she'd like to join us. We can't return on the same day … … So we'll go today and return tomorrow. Would you like to come with us? Ya, of course! I'll just change and come. Oly, I need to speak to you. Ok. You guys talk it over. Take your time. But not much. We've got a long drive ahead … Tom! Oly, are you serious? -What'll I tell your mom if she calls? -I'm an adult Ani! Obviously I know what I'm doing! What's the harm if I go out with the old man for a day? And the other guy saved me from getting mugged last night. Oly, I'm your local guardian here. No, you're not! You're my local contact. We aren't married as yet. -That gentleman knows... -You call him a gentleman? Sings in a shady bar in Soho. I doubt he has a passport even! London is full of such con men. -This is not Kolkata … -I know! The guy knows my father. He was present at my parents' wedding. -You're being childish … -I'm going! I'm not listening to you! There's food in the fridge. Heat it. -Take out the clothes from the washing machine. -Oly! Lord I'm one Lord I'm two Lord I'm three Lord I'm four Lord I'm 500 miles away from home So, if you miss this train I'm on Then you know that I have gone Hi! My name is Tom. Hi! My real name is Wasim Siddique. Everybody calls me Tom. I'm Oly. Nice to meet you, Oly. A hundred miles a hundred miles You can hear the whistle blow A hundred miles Can I ask you something? Yep. Did dad ever speak of me? Yes. Sometimes. So … why did he leave us? Might be he wanted to see the world. There're some folks, who are born in a house … … Get raised … … Go to school, college … … Then do a job. Get married … … Sire children … … Bring them up … … And then die in that house. And there are some folks who … … Can't lead a family life. We need to grab a bite. There's a bar somewhere down the road.

So if you miss the train I'm on Then you know that I have gone You can hear the whistle blow A hundred miles -Will Jerry be okay? -Ya. And my father? He's not coming back, right? Probably hunting, fishing. Difficult to say. So … what do we do? We have an apple. You want one? No. I'm good. We'll wait and see. How long? I don't know. Couple of days. What do you mean? Did I come here for nothing? He might just drop in. You're my father's friend? Ya. What do you do … as in work? You want the truth? We must keep it between you and me. Okay. I'm a Paki terrorist. We make bombs. We blow up buildings, tube stations, bridges. I'm kidding with you, man! Do I look like 9 to 5 type? With an apple in my hand. Smile a little, dear. Not feeling like. Come, let's go. Do you think my father's going to come here? At least, you got to see his house. -Right? -True. I never imagined he'll be staying in a place like this. Place like what? I don't know. It's kind of magical. -Then laugh. -What laugh? Laugh out loud. You're feeling good, right? Come, put your drink down. -And just close your eyes. -Okay. -I can't see. -Relax, relax. You trust me? Spread our arms out. Take a deep breath. Can you feel it? -Feel what? -The whole world. This is the world your father lives in. The real world. He doesn't live in some fancy house in Mayfair. Or the road from Downing Street with the politicians. He lives in the real world. With the locals, the Asians, the blacks, the Hispanics, the gypsies, the roadies. Darkness descends Birds return Boat reaches shore Only my heart beats on, unceasing O, woe rouser Will sing you a song Like the sun in your eyes Like the sea At your feet Like the moon In the sky Like the trees In the breeze I always thought my father was a selfish man. He just left us like that. But I guess if he didn't leave us … … I wouldn't have come here looking for him. And if I didn't come here I wouldn't have seen the real world. Where we meet so many different kinds of people. You fight, you make up, you save lives. You saved my life. Your call takes me by surprise O woe rouser Will sing you a song Hold me in your eyes Let your lips Kiss the breeze Come take me through the night And walk me to the sea In between my daily chores You make my tears flow in stream Touching me Filling my soul with happiness You recede And hide behind my grief O woe rouser Will sing you a song Like the sun in your eyes Like the sea At your feet Like the moon In the sky In the breeze Will sing you a song Yes. She worked in our house. As a maid. At some point she left and joined an orphanage. Yes. She returned. And was in very poor health. She was suffering from severe hepatitis. And a very bad chest infection. I admitted her to a government hospital. Gave her some money. Called her up a few times. They informed that … … Her condition was getting worse everyday. Well … I mean, as a doctor … I'm sorry to say … … It's difficult for such a patient to survive. Really sorry. Doc, you said about some hospital she was in. -Yes. -Which? Bangur Hospital. You know where Bangur Hospital is? The doc said there won't be any records. It's okay. I'll find it on my own, then. Why're you so rigid, Sarah? I completely understand your situation. At the end of the day it's a wild goose chase! The orphanage lady said she was sick. -I don't understand. -What's your problem? -My problem? -Ya, your problem. I don't have any problem! Then why you're stopping me? Why so much negativity? It's my problem. You don't have to be a part of it! Just stop the bike! I don't want you to be a part of it. Why've you got me here? Aren't we supposed to go to that Bangur hospital? -Jishu, I'm talking to you. -This is it! This is India! Each day millions are born here. Here they live, grow, perish and are born again! This is India! This is your root! You want to know why your mother gave you away, right? She barely knew you. You don't even know her! And you want to know why she dumped you? Sarah, you'll get 30 days of visa extension. What'll you do? You might not find her. She might've died. Even if she's alive, what'll you do? You take her back to London? As what … your maid? She couldn't have raised you because of this poverty. Look around you, Sarah. It's too much crap out here. Roots! Bulls♪♪♪! Ya, dad. Yes, I'm just so fed up! I don't think I can do this anymore. Once I book my tickets I'll let you know. Okay dad. See you soon. Love you. Bye. What's this? Where are you off to? I'm leaving. What! It's a waste of time. I can't do this anymore. Escaping? What do you mean? I mean … running away? Running away from what? It's not even my home! Then why did you come? I don't know. Just wanted to look for my past. Fought with your boyfriend? I don't have a boyfriend. It's just that it's impossible! Can't even find her. Just … Want to give up so easily? You've come here on 3 months' visa. This is also your country. You're going to give up 'cause you can't fathom this place? Did I mention, my husband deserted me? Yes. I did. I was just 26 then. My in-laws advised me to sell this house. But I didn't do it. Why? This is where I belong. This is my identity. And not my bloody husband! Every year Mr. Johnson comes here from France. Why? He's writing a book on Kolkata. Every year he puts up here. In the next room. Know the reason? Go, take a walk outside. Ratan! Ratan! -Yes, ma'am. -There! -Did you get my tickets to Puri? -Will buy in the evening. Didn't get them as yet! Go. Get them quickly. You know Bolpur? Rabi Tagore place? Nobel prize? Nobel! I show you that Nobel! Hey! You all right? -Hey Senorita! -Hey! You know Rudolph? Ya, I know Rudolph. Ricondo from Barcelona. I'm Sarah from UK. Nice to meet you. What I'm talking about … What work you do? -I'm a professional dancer. -Me too! Are we going or not? -You look fine. -I'm okay. I'm fine. We're planning for a trip to Bolpur. You can join us. Bolpur then … not only Bolpur … I think you guys should go with him to Bolpur. -It'll be great! -You can join us. -Rabi Tagore place? -Yeah, Rabi Tagore place. Right! You guys have fun. I'm busy with my work. I think you should go with Rudolph. You'll have a lot of fun. I cannot make it. You guys enjoy yourselves. -Rudolph! -What? You want a cigarette? Do you know anything about Bengali wedding? This city, its cragged alleys and lanes Abuzz with endless chaos and strain Saddled with sorrow and pain It tells me how to live the day This city cries still This city smiles at will This city, a home for the homeless This city, holds all in its embrace This city, my antique city Yet, in one sudden evening glow I find myself anew My true self This city cries still This city smiles at will This city, a home for the homeless This city, holds all in its embrace -Oh, hello! How are you? -Very well! I'm extremely sorry to barge in your party like this. No, you're most welcome. -You're absolutely welcome! -Thanks. -This place is looking beautiful. -Thank you. 'Ma' Sarah, you're looking … a little stressed. I don't know. You just called me 'Ma'. In Bengali, we often call our daughters 'mothers'. Really? I didn't know that. There're a lot of things you didn't know. But I know about your … crisis … problems. Jishu is very transparent. He's told me all. So, if you don't mind, I want to tell you something. Of course! Sure! In this poor country of ours … … There's no instant solution to all problems. Sometimes you go on for a long period of time … … Searching for a solution. But there is no solution. So at times just … let yourself go! Do something else. Forget about it. Free yourself. I think, I kind of understand what you're saying. Do you? -You come from a great city, London. -Ya. But you know what? Kolkata is also a great city. -Of course! -Go! Discover it. Walk around. Go anywhere you want. Go to the … red light district. I think you should visit Mallick Ghat. Mallick … where? Riverfront steps of Mallick Ghat. Flower market. Beside the river. Under the Howrah bridge. -You don't need to interfere. -Sorry! -This is Mr. Sunil. Jishu's father. -Hello! -Namaskar! -Namaste! Jishu will explain her everything. Jishu … will … explain! Why? Jishu, no need to stand there and sulk. Come here. Why? Because the girl's from London. She has to be explained in English. For this Jishu. I'll manage. Jishu, take care of your guest. I'll take care of your father. Drink for you, dear father? No. But what are you trying to explain? What's there to explain? Spending your life in the police force … … And giving explanations to ministers and bureaucrats … … Has reduced you to this. Learn to take decisions! That'll improve our race. That's fine … but … why Jishu? Won't say! This is not the police force … … In any case you're retired … … I don't owe you an explanation! Will not answer to your query. So you won't drink? -No. -Let's have fish croquettes then. Jishu! Dude I lost my slippers. -Oh! You did? -Ya. -But how? -I don't know. Some girls called me for dancing, and I put it there. And then I can't find it. You'll get it, I'm sure. Hope so. Now you're the Cindrella without slippers. Did I mention? What? That I'm sorry. That's okay Jishu. You don't have to keep saying it. It's not okay. I shouldn't have shouted, in front of so many people. I'm really sorry. Do you think I should nick someone else's slippers? What! No … you'll get your slippers. Did I mention you're looking pretty? If I count then it's the 5th time you're telling me that! -I did! -Thank you so much! You're welcome. Did I mention … -Don't say sorry again. -No, no. -Not about the sorry part. -Then? Do you have a boyfriend? Living the dull life daily Soul restless and uneasy I find suddenly your inviting arms Running through my veins All the pain and torment I cast them aside And reach out for you Arms spread wide The unknown merge with the familiar The lips come and unite together This city cries still This city smiles at will This city, a home for the homeless This city, holds all in its embrace This city, its cragged alleys and lanes Abuzz with endless chaos and strain Saddled with sorrow and pain It tells me how to live the day This city cries still This city smiles at will This city, a home for the homeless This city, holds all in its embrace It's hot water. Careful, careful! She's coming. Morning! You sing really well. Heard yesterday. Did you learn? Yes … could you contact dad? He'll be here. Let's wait for another couple of hours. Why can't we call him? We can, but his phone's switched off at times. You must've felt we're a little crazy. Your dad's also like us. Are you bored here? Not at all, but … … The reason why I've come here … You want to know why your dad left your mom … … And came here, right? That I've understood. You've told me. He wanted to travel the world. Wanted to see places … Suppose you don't meet your dad. I'll try to make you meet him, but if it doesn't happen … -You know the reason now. -But that's not enough! -Not enough! -Of course not! So many questions since childhood. I want to know if he loved me … … If he wanted to see me as much as I wanted to see him? You won't understand. Okay, I'll make you meet him. Jerry keeps his words. -Why did you leave the country? -Same reason as your dad's. Curiosity and wanderlust are in every Bengali's blood. They fade as one gets older. Mario explain! We, who are less talented … ...They call us backpackers. Hi! Hi! You are? Who I am? Oh, Sorry! Mario. Nice to meet you. You are? -Oly. -O …? -Oly. -Oly! Yeah! Your father and I met in Rome, last year … … For our Roman holiday. Yeah. It was great! My father! Yea, your father and I … Oh sorry, didn't tell you, I wanted to be an actor. And he said, 'you should come to England'. And here I am. So … you met dad, after he came to London? No. We first went to Paris, then we went to … … Barcelona, then we … Berlino … Then Rome. And then there was a toss up … … UK or USA … We chose UK. It was so lovely! Dad was teaching in London University. One of his students is a facebook friend. That's how I know. Your dad's into a lot of things. Can't stick to one fixed job. Mario, we should pack up and move towards the beach. Gentlemen! We have a special guest here. Our dear friend Deepak who was supposed to be with us, can't make it … … For reasons we all understand. However … His one and only daughter … Has joined us all the way from Kolkata, India. And what's more … … She can sing! Please raise hands, bottles, glasses, whatever you have. As we say welcome, to this beautiful young lady … And thank you for gracing us with your presence. Gentlemen, I give you Oly! Come on Oly, don't be shy. We just want to hear your voice. I don't know what to say … … But, thank you all for making me feel at home. I've never felt this way before. So, I'm really grateful to you all. And the thing is … … I don't know any English song. Don't worry about that! We're the people of the world. This is something that'll break the ice … … And make Oly sing. You know what's that, don't you Oly? Yes, I do. So, all we need to do … just light it up. Relax … and afterwards you can sing. All religions … … All creeds … … All languages, all everything just break away. Trust me! Try that. What the hell! -Suitcase on the bed! -Oh aunty! -There you are! -Will I help you? No. Wanted to have your room cleaned. Every year this time I go to Puri. -Puri? -Okay. -Seaside. -Seaside! Awesome! Sarah, the keys to the upper floor. -Keep it. -Why? -To prepare meals. -Okay. Will Ratan roam on the streets? The maid will do the daily dusting. You just need to unlock my room in the mornings. Sure! Don't have street food at all. Just tell them what you want, they'll cook for you. -All right. Thank you. -Just like your own house. Right? You could've given it to Ratan. Why did you give it to me? Will you steal and flee? No problem with that! Of course not! Would've given the keys to my daughter if she were here. She isn't here. So, giving it to you. Did I mention my husband deserted me? Ya, you mentioned it. Since I've been alone for so long … … I'm confused between who's my own and who's not! Those who come to my house are my own. From now on this house is yours. Just for 3 days! I'll return after 3 days. Take care. Don't eat street food. Have fun. Ratan, fetch a cab. Madam! -I … -Are you kidding me? -Nitai! What? -Gone. You can't come to my house like that, every time! What did you do now? Madam! My mom's in bad condition. Stomach … operation … Netai, I know your problem. You've taken money from some mafia … … And you tried to sell some drugs from tourists. And some Russians took your drugs. I understand everything but, why you're here again? Madam … Babluji … … That Madrasi guy will slit my throat. Doesn't know this place. I just need one night. Nitai, I'm really sorry you're on the streets, but … Last time you came I got really scared and I beat you up. But you just can't keep coming to our place like that. Why? Because it's not my house. It's not your house? It's somebody else's house. No! Aunty said it's your house. This is your house. Her house is yours. You're like her daughter. Don't I understand English? -Look Netai. Just … -What? What 'look'? 'Look look look' all the time. What will I see? I've seen … you're rich, I'm poor! So what? We're same. You were born here! My skin is white! So? People get cheated. What are you yapping for? You were after all a maid's daughter! Your Brit parents adopted you and made you a queen! You're blind to the reality here. Stay here and you'll know. I'm getting royally jacked! My mom will die! Is that nice? Stone in stomach. -Stone inside the stomach! -What? Forget it! I can understand English! Can't give me simple shelter! Teaching English, huh! Today I'll stay here. Won't move out! Do what you want. I won't leave! Phone a friend! Go ahead. That's my bottle of vodka! Phone your tall boy-friend! Hey, that's my vodka!

What I'm saying is, Oly wants to meet her dad. -You decide for her nowadays? -No, I decide for myself What's your point? A while back we wanted to go. Suddenly why this? -On the streets of Cornwall, you'll … -What am I doing here? You promised a meeting! Where's my father? I thought your dad's here … … And it's the third day. He isn't here. -He might be in Scotland … -Then let's go to Scotland! -I'm informing Anindyo. -No! I've promised Anindyo I'll take you back … …Tom, if you don't like it, you hitch a hike, take a train or do whatever. What are you doing? You know what … … I think it's time we … … Wrap it up. I think it's time we let her go. Why? Because she has a boyfriend? He has a good job. He has a house. He's settled. I'm nothing, is that what you mean? C'mon Tom, she knows nothing about you. She doesn't know the truth about you. Let her go! She has a future. -What if I told her the truth? -What? What if I told her the truth? What if I told her I've been to jail? And she still wants to go with me. What if, Jerry? I've never felt this way before. You'll find somebody. You've always found somebody. There was Jennifer. There was Sonia. You'll find somebody. She has a future. It's always the whores and cheap one night stands for me! Why do I get the impression that you never really saw me as your own? Why do I get that feeling that you don't want me to settle down? -That's utter bulls♪♪♪! -That's no bulls♪♪♪! The truth is that you need me. I've never ever asked you for anything Jerry! The truth is you need me to do the crappy jobs that nobody else does. You need me to drive you around that nobody else does. You need to pick you up everytime you're f♪♪♪♪♪♪ drunk. You need me to clean up your crap. You understand Jerry? You need me! You need me. Every f♪♪♪♪♪♪ time you need me! And you know what? I don't need you. What … Tom … Tom! What happened? Just got few things to sort out. I've got to do few things. Jerry's gonna take you back. What do you mean? I thought we'll all travel together! Listen, it's not the time. -Where's the car keys? -I don't know. -What about our plan? -Where's the car keys? -What about our plans? -There are no plans. Okay, cut it out guys. -What's the matter? -Nothing. He'll take a bus and go. I'll take you to Anindyo. -And who decides for me?

You said we're going to see the world. And then what happens? Jerry says something and you run off like a rat! You're right! I'm a rat. I've been running like a rat from God knows where … … And how long! You know another thing about this rat? I'm an illegal immigrant. I've never been accepted. Everybody here always looks at me as a Paki. Back in Pakistan, everyone looks at me as a criminal. You know why? 'Cause I've been into jail more than you've had hot dinners. You want to be a part of this? I'm a f♪♪♪♪♪♪ rat! One thing I'm not sorry about is having showed your daddy's world. This is your daddy's world! And I have no regrets about having loved you. Take care Oly. Oh my god! Nitai! You're right? Crap! Oh my god! Jishu, please do something! Oh my god! I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Please call.. ambulance Can you just do something now? Are you Nitai's mom? Is Nitai your son? Sarah, give me the photograph, please. Is this you? Yes. Nitai's sent money with her. She's come from abroad. You've got to go to the hospital. Is Nitai well? Netai's sent money with her. You've got to go to the hospital. Let's go. The keys. -Take care. -Take care of yourself. Tom's left. Saw him leaving. Will you please tell me what's going on here? Tom is an illegal immigrant. The guys in his community will get him out if he's caught. And what about dad? Have you ever realised why it's so difficult to find your dad? -Why? He's also an illegal …? -No! Permanent residency is not just a voter's ID! Your father has fallen off the map! Then why did you bring me here? I'm going to Cornwall. You have to go back to Anindyo because … I promised him that, I owe him that. When's the operation? It's done today. Waiting for her to recover. And if she recovers then … … The hospital will release her. Then, Sarah? Have you thought of that? You can't take her to Manchester, can you? Can you? I mean no offence meant. She needs a home. If all goes well … … She'll have to come to our home. She'll be taken care of and … … You can visit whenever you want. My door is always open. No, mom I don't know. I've not been looking for her. I just don't know if she's alive or dead. I'm here with some other woman. She's like extremely sick. I jus' don't know. Tell you later mom. Do these tests and meet me at my chamber. Excuse me doc, how's she? Well, the medicines seem to be working but … … Her basic parameters are not okay. Not all of them. I personally think she's going to improve. Thank you so much doctor. It really means a lot. Thank you. Nobody does a thing like that these days. A few more days in that slum, she'd have gone! -See you tomorrow. -See you. Hey! What's up? Everything's fine. Thank you so much. Without you I couldn't have found her. I think you need rest. I think I need rest. Got to go to office for a change. And look after the business. I didn't know your mom's no more. I'm really sorry to hear that. Thank you so much for her jewellery. Your mom, my mom … … Mom is a mom, right? Before I forget, I should tell you. Dad wants you to … … Shift from Taltola apartment to uncle's house. That's his wish. And what's your wish? What's your wish? I think I'm still that Cinderella who does not have slippers. You want it back? No, you keep it. I'll just be back. Go talk to Anindyo. I'm waiting. -Give me ten minutes. -Yeah. Ani! We need to talk. Yes. Let's go inside. It's important. Say it here. You haven't come here to stay. Saw the guy's waiting outside. Till now, you spoke and I listened. I'm all ears. So you didn't find your dad … … Need to go once again with him. I don't want to marry. Not right now. We Bengalis have a problem. Wherever we go in this world … … We form a huddle. And I don't want to do that! I don't want to be like one of your pals here. I just want to see the world. There's so much to do. So much to see. Sharing my thoughts with you as a friend. Who else will understand me? Oly! Here … go! Want to see the world? Go … see it! Then you'll understand whatever I have … … Is not easy to achieve. -You're misunderstanding … -Let me finish! You've said a lot. It's my turn now. You think I'm this typical office goer, boring type? Leaving one's country, getting a job and … … Managing a house like this, is not easy. There's a sense of adventure in that as well! I feel so. You go … … See the world. I'm here. You come back. We'll talk. Ani, you've got me wrong! What do you want to say? Nothing! Where's Jerry? Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! There are some people who … … Can't lead a family life. They hit the road. They go around and see the world. Somewhere in this world … … He breathes his last. My dad! That man was my dad! Oly, don't cry. Have you seen my Nitai, dear? Yes. Is he well? Your Brit parents adopted you and made you a queen! Stay here and you'll know. I'm getting royally jacked! This is my mother! Yes, mom … How are you? I'm fine. There wasn't any network. Yes, going towards Scotland. Yes, Ani has booked. Highlanders Inn. Highlanders.. Inn. I'll call you when I reach. Have your medicines on time. Bye!
