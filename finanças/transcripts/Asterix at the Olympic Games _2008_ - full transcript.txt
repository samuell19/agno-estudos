Subtitle done by Helm. Feel free to correct any mistake. Names have been kept from the original French. We are in the year 50 B.C. All Gaul is under Roman occupation. All of it?... No! A small village of invincible Gauls still resists the invaders. Under the vigilance of the Romans in Babaorum, Aquarium, Laudanum and Petit Bonnum... the Gauls try to live a peaceful life. All of them? Not everyone... This morning, someone woke up even before the sun rose. Have a safe trip, Telegrafix. Even though the Gauls cannot be defeated nobody said they could not be conquered! After a few months, the heart of Alafolix beats only for Irina. Princess of Greece! AST?RIX NOS JOGOS OL?MPICOS Translation by Helm. Complains will be ignored =P Princess look! Telegrafix is back! What have you brought this time? "This morning, Irina! Starts a long trip! Love will be without a doubt the guide to my steps. Those beautiful eyes will finally be able to see me in person. In three moons, my love, my heart will be yours!" In three moons... Never. I shall never marry Brutus! I love another! Oh! Yes! A charming mysterious prince! That knows how to use passionate words! I fell in love with his words, they are the words of a poet. They are profoundly carved in me! And by the way he writes, I know he is also... And how do you know it is not Brutus that writes those poems to you? Brutus is a valiant man, virtuous, and of good will! A brave knight! Someone told me! We were not expecting you, oh Brutus! Titi! Titi! Slowly Titi! Slowly! Sloowwwwwwwly! Eh! It was the saddle that got loose! Primeirus! Yes! Ready! Find me a slaughterer! To stuff that stupid animal! I wish your heart has Caesar wishes the world! Armed with my love I travel south! ...the weasel, all the animals in the woods... ...so that together we can shout: Irina! Are you?... What? Is it him? It is me! Brutus! Brutus! We were not expecting you so soon! Greetings! I am truly sorry that I got delayed in fulfilling my promise! You did not lie Saragas! She is splendid! You will not lose in my delay! Pretty, hem? It's me, you and a big lion! Ah so! The two of us watching the sky! I just let myself fall into the imaginary! And that's not all! I know you love poetry! Isn't that so? I myself am a reference! And allow me to compose some verses in the glory to your beauty! Helm! I do not need anything! I wish you! As I never wished anyone! I do not need anything! I wish you! As Winter loves the Fall! I do not need anything! I wish you! I do not need anything! I wish you! Like the love in our Verona! Is it ok? Is it ridiculous? Yes! Yes! It?s because I didn?t feel it! I didn?t do it well! I got confused! Enough! Who said that? Me! My name is Alafolix! Your name is what? Alafolix! And I come from the Gaelic village that still resists to Jules Caesar! Is that true? I love princess Irina and I wish to marry her! And who dares to defy Brutus? Are you the son of a king? The son of a Hercules with a job still to be finished? Another suitor to try to steal the princess from me? I am going to win the Olympic Games! Is that so? And what do I do? Explain it to me because I didn?t really get it! I knee at your feet! I dance the circus dance! You truly amused me, little Gaul! Yes, you amuse me! But that?s enough! Jail him! No! How come no? I take the challenge! Which challenge? I will marry the winner of the Olympic Games! But the hell is going on here? The king has the right to give his daughter to a man whose bravery is equal to that of his people! So what? That?s me! Two seconds! Two seconds! You are stubborn! I love that! I love that! To sum up! If that is the will of my daughter! As such, that should be the will of the king! As such what? In such way that it is so! I will tell my father! No! No! Brutus, wait! It?s just a tiny Gaul! France is a beast! Why do you say that, Obelix? It?s an evil beast! The wolf eats the lamb! The shark, the little fish! The spider, the fly! It?s always the most docile that is weaker! But sometimes they show its strength to hide their fears! Yes! When I give some slaps, and being I the strongest, the one that takes it becomes frightened! But when we do not know who is the strongest and who is the weakest, it is normal to defend ourselves! I believe that the true strength is to know how to hold one?s strength! I will never be strong! What is wrong with this Roman? I don?t know! I?m going to ask him! I am sorry, Roman! Is there someone following you? I am known as Edus! I am the quickest man in the Roman Empire! That?s true! You do run quite fast! I am the strongest, and I have been chosen to represent Rome in the Olympic Games! Per Jupiter! Careful! See? It?s stronger than you! It?s the tree?s fault! Yah! Yah! If it would not be for the tree, this would have never happened! The problem is that in the forest there are many trees! Exactly! Look! Edus! O.K.! I got it! It was the strongest that threw the tree! But I am the strongest! Come on! Come here, Gaul! Come here, Gaul! ...the Gauls are always the strongest! I play Asterix, not a Roman! Now you play the Romans! Alafolix! Alafolix is here! Alafolix is back! Caesar doesn?t get old! It matures! These hairs do not whiten! They illuminate! Caesar is immortal! For a long time! Caesar conquered all! He?s unstoppable! He does not leave less than nothing! Doesn?t owe anything! Nor to cousins, nor to Brothers! Nor to the settlers in Sicily! Caesar is lord and master! And that that did not belong to Caesar has been given to Caesar! Ave I! Ave! It?s me, Brutus! I want to see Caesar! Hurry up! The password! Hum...! 29 AG 140 V! No! Lodicus! Give me the password! The password? The access password! Four! Four! Seven! No! One thousand! Do you know the password? No! It?s him who knows it! Step aside! Ave and one! Twenty four! Enough! Enough! Enough! You, don?t leave the place you are standing! Stay close to the cross, it?s going to be nice! Bring the crossbows! Ave Caesar! I come from Greece! Can I talk to you? Caesar hears you! There has been a little step back! The marriage has been delayed! Don?t worry! It?s nothing serious! It?s just Saragas decided to give his daughter to the winner of the Olympic Games! And that?s why I decided to represent Rome! Who? You? Yes! Me! But that?s ridiculous! Why? Because you are incapable of representing yourself! Because the Romans are quicker than the rest, jump and throw farer! Caesar is Roman! The world is well shaped! No! Your place is not in the stadium! Tarnishing the image of Caesar! I don?t care, I am going anyway! It?s Caesar that forbids you! I don?t care! By Jupiter, my son! Stop winning! It?s always the same! Every time I have a little ambition, you come along and cut away my dreams! If mommy would be here! Come on, stop that! If that?s what you want! Alea jacta es! If you want to show off! Then go! Go exhibit yourself to the Greeks! Oh, dad, I almost forgot! I brought you a present from Greece! A wonderful olive! I am truly sorry, I run out of tasters! These ones are trustful! I tried them myself! Must I remember you that since the beginning of the year 47 tasters have died? Ah! Yes! Forty seven is a lot! Yes! But that one you can eat! I knew that there had to be something wrong with this olive! Alafolix! Come here! We want to welcome you! Where is our great traveler? Alafolix! What are you doing? Step forward! Is that a Greek costume? To marry the princess I must win the Olympic Games! I will never be able to win! I prefer to hang myself that go through that! Alafolix! You are hanging by your feet! I do not wish to die! I wish to love! He needs to win the what games? The Olympic Games, Obelix! The Games that happen every four years in Olympia! Games reserved only to Roman and Greek provinces! We are Gauls, so we cannot participate! Those are the rules! For love to the moon... to surrender itself! Shut up! I am going to help you wining those games! But how, Obelix? Wining! Don?t say nonsense, Obelix! We are Gauls, not Roman! We just need to disguise ourselves as Romans! Oh! Yah! And how do you do that? I cut away my moustache! By Toutatis! We are Romans! Romans? Since when? Since Gaul?s defeat by Jules Caesar! What? No way! We have not been defeated! Calm down, love! Watch your heart! Asterix is right! Officially we are a Roman province Therefore, we are Romans! Therefore, we are allowed to participate in the Olympic Games! And winning! And I can marry the Princess! I am going with you to Greece! I am going to sing the Gaelic hymn! Obelix! The weak, the strong! I only confiscated the harp! Perfect! Asterix and Obelix will accompany Alafolix to the Olympic Games! Watch out, Caesar! We are on our way! I will join you! I will prepare my magic potion to make us more effective! We are Roman! We are Roman! We are Roman! We are Roman! Magic potion? Nice, this! Gentlemen! Wrong way! Are they crazy or what? Come! Let?s go back! Look! That?s real fighting! Look! Look! That?s the real thing! Magnificent! Watch! That a look at those laterals! And the abdominals! One, two, three! All in it?s place! And next to the neck!? No! They are eunuchs! I forced tem to... cut! I could not have them living surrounded by temptation! Help me! I tired from the practice! Slowly! Slowly! Give me the report from the practice! Length? Twelve feet! Throwing? Twenty six feet! Twenty six feet? Wonderful, I am improving! Triathlon? That doesn?t exist! I want to rest now! I?m going to sleep! Primeirus! Sing me something! Everything is wonderful! Everything is marvelous! Everything is kind! Everything is generous! Will a man really give... No! No!... Sing something, I don?t care what! Sing me some counting! 596, 597! 598, 599! Ave! Brutus! Ave! Brutus! Turtle formation! Turtle formation! That?s in turtle? Yes! No! That?s not a turtle! Yes, but to the military, that is what we call ?The Turtle?! From the military point of view! From the animal point of view, it?s round, has four tiny paws and an ugly face! Understood! I want to see the animal point of view now! Turtle formation in animal point of view! Exactly! THAT is a turtle! What is this formation they are doing? It?s an attack formation! Attack to what? From their point of formation, to us! To us!? What?s going on? The Games! What about the Games? If you want to win them! What do you thing I am doing? Start practicing, working out! What I mean, oh Brutus, Is that it is necessary that you yourself run, jump and throw! Are you giving me an order? Yes! Yes! You just game me an order! I don?t think so, oh great Brutus! Primeirus! Did he or did he not give me an order? Why don?t I cut away your tongue? Did he or did he not give me an order? Articula! You gave me an order! Nothing serious! Nothing serious! You need to recognize to be forgiven! So, just say it: - Yes, I gave you an order! Yes! I... I... gave... ... gave you an order! See? Were you scared, hem? I am not a monster! You thought I was going to slaughter you? He thought I was going to slaughter him! Thrown him to the lions! This way he will stop ordering around! Everything you need, oh great Brutus! You will be paid according to results! I gave it the name of E.F.O.! Elixir For the Olympics! Totally undetectable! Even with this greenish colour! And does it work? If it works? The E.F.O.? It?s going to make out of your athletes the Gods of the stadium! Primeirus! Let it go! Put it back! Tell me something! Do you, by any chance, have something... ...that allows to eliminate someone... ...that might be, lets say, the master of the world, being the interested his son... ... whose son wants very much to get rid of him?! You want to assassinate Caesar? Do you have something or not? I have something! What are you waiting for? Go get it! I don?t need to look for it! Oh great Brutus, here is the Coveredinpus! The inventor of the death system! A macabre and terrible young man. Are you fooling me or what? Of course not! Let me show you, Brutus. Remind me of your name? Coveredinpus! Mine is Brutus! The great Brutus! The evil Brutus! The rule is easy to understand! Do what I ask you! If I am satisfied, I will cover you in gold. But if I am displeased, I will order you slaughtered! So? What are you going to do? Well, it depends on the kind of death you wish! Slow death, quick death, drowning... ...without pain... ...by poisoning... No, death, everything that is death, doesn?t need to be specified! I was very thirsty! I believe I have the solution. The dissolution! The what? It has the same colour as bathing salts, it looks like bathing salts, it smells like bathing salts, but they are not bathing salts! With this, the subject disappears! Reduced to nothing! How do you use it? Give it to me! Put four grains! Four! Not more! And for a special occasion? Marriage? Birth? I have what I want! You, we see each other in the Olympics! Let?s go! Greece it not exactly right there! Ah! Greece! The Acropolis! Who knows... maybe... one day! Listen, and we end: - ... in the middle of the whales... Your love in my heart solid as a chain! How do you manage to verse with the words? They come out always so beautiful! First I need to eat, but not much! Then I need to forget that I am strong, then... ...the words come out! I?m hungry! For a few days, Rome is going to loose its title of the capital of the Empire, Because it?s to another city that athletes and supporters travel to, coming from all around the world! Champions from all provinces are going to fight without weaponry! And that is how they are going to celebrate the universal virtue that is sports in the heart of the majestic city in which the olympic symbol was born! OLYMPIA! Make the greeting! Ave Caesar?! Yes, Ave Caesar, that?s it! These Romans are really nervous! With the presence of Caesar in the Olympic Games, the border control has increased! Why do you want to reject a new game in the Games? Because it works the way it is! Things evolve! A little piece of Modernism! Bunch of ignorants! Well! We use the bladder of a pig use teams of eleven athletes and the objective is to put the ball in the fisherman?s net using the feet! And tell me, what are you going to call this game? To which discipline is it going to belong to? I am going to call it ?Foot on the Ball?! That?s ridiculous! It will never work out! Maybe! I?m sorry! We want to inscribe ourselves! You?ve mistaken the line! For spectators the queue is downstairs! No! No! We are not spectators! We are athletes! Yes! The Gaul-Romanic delegation! You are Athletes?? You!? Why? You can?t tell? Of course you do! Bunch of morons! If you don?t mind, it?s the next one to the left! Be good! Ave daddy! Grab that! Ave daddy! You do not wake up a sleeping Caesar! I just arrived! There is a big traffic jam at the exit of Rome! And all provoked by the fact we are here. All your personal is here in Greece? Caesar brought his rooms with himself. I?ve been in Greece since Monday! Caesar is always at home in his Empire! I have great news! Look what I brought you from Rome! What is that? Bathing Salts! They are really great! You won?t believe it! This softens the skin! Rejuvenates! You know what? I am going to prepare you a bath! And you are going to try it! It?s a little bit strange in the beginning because of the vapours! It?s very intense! If you can see, you conquer! It?s always good to have new things to try! And you can always have them! It?s going to be a pity! It?s going to dissolve better this way! I hope I didn?t put too much! Daddy, don?t worry about the foam! It?s perfectly normal! Makes part of the treatment! In any case, I think the water is too hard around here! Besides, there is nothing better than feeling some fluctuation! Well, I hope your bath works well! Bath assessor! Did you stop to train yourselves? Obelix, no! You are going to make the opponents loose motivation! It is anti-sports! Obelix! Look! In the forest! He was running... Piudus... Aquapum... Edus! Eh oh! Edus! We are here! Oh! No! Not the Gauls! Look! He fell! See you soon! It?s them! It?s them! It?s the Gauls I told you about! We are screwed! We are so screwed! Where is Brutus? I have a very important message for him! The Gauls have a potion that makes them invincible! It?s impossible to defeat them! We will be massacred! If I find someone whistling I will order her slaughtered! She is pretty! Yes! I know! Ave daddy! Ave I! Hispania! Germany! Gaul! Rome! Greece! Egypt! Not bad! Yes! I beg your pardon! Excuse me! What a nice instrument! Are you a musician? I am a Gaelic bard. My god! I?m also a bard! I?m Assurantourix. Assurantourix? I know all your songs by hard! And what are you doing in Gaul, my friend? That is not mine. Francixalanix! I am a fan! I am also a fan of myself! Is my E.F.O. ready? Absolutely fresh! I did it this morning! Very well! Let?s go! It has a funny smell! It wasn?t made to smell well! It was made to make someone good! She did not want me at first, but today there will be more things dropping that her heart! We see him few times without his armour! He fooled us! He has some muscle! You know, that?s just to impress! It is almost always empty inside! He can take his chances now! I am sure he did not make the call! He didn?t! In this sport you really need to! Everything ok, daddy? I think this sport is pretty! Disk throwing? Yes! I prefer the hammer throwing! Come on! Go! It?s one of ours! He?s from my village! You?ll see! That?s because of the magic potion! Magic portion? Yes! But it?s all a question of dosage! It?s all a question of wrist! Wrist? Yes! This one cannot scratch herself anymore! You made a dart throwing, I, well, I didn?t! But the Gauls are invincible! They have a magic potion! We can?t beat them! The Gauls have a magic potion and you didn?t tell me anything! I passed the information to one of your centurions! Which centurion? Which one? Tell me and I will order his tongue cut off! Objection! Protest! Reclamation! I accuse these Gauls to be using a magic potion that makes them invincible! And you yourself didn?t drink something? That?s beside the point! Coz I lost! Let?s make the anti-doping test! You grab the balloon! Like this! And blow strongly inside! As you have seen, nothing happened! It?s negative! See? Well, I fell inside the caldron when I was a child! This is not a question of dosage! This is a question of doping! Come on, be a little bit generous! We are sorry about it! The Gaul-Romanic athletes have been disqualified! Bravo! Because they used magic, their points have been withdrawn! Therefore, the winners for this round are... ...the Greek! Let?s go! A defeat like this cannot happen! With a performance like this, you are at the moment the joke of the whole empire! Listen well, Brutus! If you do not win the Games, you will not only loose the marriage, as your status! Caesar will make you the rules of his smallest province! The most distant and most barbarous of the all! And you will never put your feet back in Rome. By Juno! And so I have spoken! Ave! I swear I am going to kill you! What? What are you saying? Me? Nothing! Oh! Yes! I was thinking out loud! I was thinking I haven?t given you anything for a long time! Get out! Your helm! Alafolix! Nothing is lost! Nothing is lost! Nothing is lost! With or without potion we are smart and brave! We are Gauls! Look at them! They have muscles everywhere and tons of strength! Muscles? What are muscles? Decoration? Look at my skeleton! It?s the same as yours, I believe! Actually, yours is prettier! Think about your princess! Exactly! Obelix is right! Think about Irina! Ok? Obelix will train you! You can beaten him up with strength without fearing to hurt him! Come on! Prepare yourself! Think about Irina! Not like that! Stronger! Don?t be scared! Stronger! Stop! Asterix is right! You need the whole arm to accompany the body! Like this! You had to beat him? I didn?t beat him! I made a demonstration! No, you beat him! No! It was a figure of speech! I made him understand with gestures! And since when did I ask you to show him with gestures? Well! Are training or not? I am the one training! You don?t do anything! Anything! From now on, it?s mister Asterix that gives the advises! Mister Asterix knows more than everybody else! I am not giving any counseling because Mister Obelix is playing the dumb one! No! I don?t feel like it! So, you were waiting for Assurancetourix! Oh, look at this poor souls! Were is the happiness here? You tell me, where is it? Assurancetourix! What are you doing here? I came to know that our village is known for my art! I am finally in the city of arts! You sing, you exhibit! Then you can stay here! Alafolix! You can?t say everything, Alafolix! You gave up on you responsibilities! You have a passionate heart! And a heart like that is stronger than any athlete! That?s pretty! What? An athlete?s heart! A passionate heart! An athlete?s heart! A passionate heart! Irina!? Irina!? Alafolix? A kiss! I have lost everything! An oath doesn?t give you more! A very precise promise! I feel that you trust me! As the point... As the point is safe... of being on top of the i to the verb "aimer" (to love)! What? On the i! The iiiiiii! Is there someone there! No! No one here! Alafolix, present me the one that has spoken, please! This is Obelix, my princess! I am the keeper of his heart! He keeps my heart! He has an incredible strength! Look! I am going to jump! No! Yes! No! Yes! Ai! Irina! Irina! Thank you! It?s the first time I grab a princess! Go on! Walk a little bit! Go, I will watch for the guards! Are you also in love? You make a nice couple! And so do these ones! Well! I need to go back quickly! I will make a rope! Be careful, Obelix! I... you... the... My princess! Brutus! My foam of love! My wine tree leaf! It is me, your future husband! I am truly sorry to disturb you at such late hour, but... While remembering your beauty, some verses came to me... ...I wanted to share them with you immediately! Like a heart on top of my heart! The wolf like a dead horse! As my heart, these feathers do not know if they know already! That I love you! That I love you! Damn it! It?s always in this point I get lost! I?m sorry! It?s from the emotion! The little naughty one! Do you see what I made her do! Brutus knows best! Something tells me you are going back alone tonight! I?m going, my princess! I?m climbing with my strong arms! You are tougher than the others! We will spend a nice time together! I am not dresses! Don?t worry! I?m going up! And I feel there is going to be love! I am not proper! No one has ever sang in a stadium before! It would be quite a show! My friends, please come in! I am sorry to receive you in this tent! With good will, even the camel?s tent is proper! It?s a proverb from Mesopotamia! Surprise! What is this? A little present! Do you know how we call this in our professional area? Corruption! Small word! It?s no corruption at all! Corruption is only if I give you this money! Then could we know what this is? This is gold! A little present in gold! And if it?s a present, it?s rude to refuse! No, Brutus milord! You are wrong! We are honest, dignified, correct people! Gentlemen, follow me! We made ourselves clear! Eh! Dumbass! I have a proposal! What is I asked you two to be slaughtered? You and dumbass, right in the middle? We take the gold, ok? Yes, ok! We will take it right now! Yes! My children! In the fighting round no tricks will be necessary! You will see! The winner that the whole world will want! The strongest man in the world! He eats 5 bulls every breakfast! He smashes coconuts with his hands just to drink its water! He?s a war machine! As strong as a mountain! I present you: Humungus! Come this way! Don?t make sudden movements, because you might disturb him! We are similar, us! We had a little disagreement some time ago, but it was nothing otherwise I would have had him slaughtered! He is so strong that the horse that brought him her has pains in his knees!! He is unique! My Humungus! My Humungus! Stay still! Still! Did he eat already? Three times! Your place is right here! Athlete heart! We should give him a bit of magic potion! Rome is the winner! We won! Next! Next! Come on! It?s magnificent this environment! Finally a public to match my qualities! I must sing! Absolutely not! Just a little bit! Why won?t you you shut up? Obelix, we don?t use tricks! Assurancetourix, you are not singing! Roma, winner! We are truly sorry! For being the strongest! Caesar feel good, finally! Tear the neck of the Gaul! Reduce him to dust and I will cover you in gold! You got it? I?ll cover you in gold! You?re a beast! A beast! Go! What about this? Maybe? Ok! Deal! Go! Come on! For Irina! Alafolix! Don?t worry! I?ll send you an invitation for my marriage with the princess! Of course, if you have the gracefulness of inviting me to your funeral! From behind! Get up! It was his roar that got me distracted! Rome, winner by withdrawal! Brutus is the winner! Asterix! If I could! He can?t! What is he doing? What is going on? Any problem? Brutus is the winner! We can?t do anything! Even when he looses he is declared winner! Well! Do you have a minute? Great victory! The greatness of Rome is beautiful! Not only you won the games, as you will be known as the winners of the cheating till the edges of the Empire! There was no cheating! I am not talking to you! I am talking to your daddy! Jules Caesar will be the champion of the Olympic foul play! Should I have him impaled? Devoured? Cut into...? What boldness! Little Gaul! Who dares to defy Caesar? You are very brave! Other players met the lions for less! Come on, daddy! In you place I?d have him slaughtered! You say that Rome cheated! You say that the spectators were fooled! Let it be known, little Gaul, that Rome is not Brutus! And that Caesar has always made the will of submissive conquered lands! Ave! Do you wish a proof of courage and bravery? Without potions or corrupted judges? Do you want blood, sweat and tears? How do you think Caesar got to this place? I declare that the winner will be the winner of the last game! The quadrig race! Enough! Stupid! Coveredinpus! What is your trap? Well, it?s this way: Caesar is in love with his own reflection, so it?s his reflection that will kill him! How does that work?? It?s a normal mirror, but in its edges it has poisonous darts! As soon as a person gets in front of the mirror the reflection makes the mechanism shoot! The darts are shoot and it?s an instantaneous death! Instantaneous! Because it?s regulated for instantaneous! But we can choose suffering instead! To quick death, slow, painful... Yes! Yes! I got it! Help me! Daddy! How are you? I present you Coveredinpus! Coveredinpus! Jules Caesar, my dad! Coveredinpus is a skilful craftsman! He was the one that made your present! Coveredinpus! Tell him about the present! Yes, it was you who made it! You can talk a bit better about it! Ave ave! Oh great one! Oh immense Caesar! That?s me! So, this it it, Caesar! It?s a mirror! But it?s just a big mirror because what is a mirror to Caesar? Because Caesar is beauty! And it?s no regular beauty! It?s THE beauty! Beauty! It?s everything of what is the most handsome! What I mean is that a mirror cannot give a better image that the beauty of Caesar, since it?s Caesar itself! And prettier is impossible! And we cannot reveal to Caesar a reflection that is prettier than him! But to the level of Caesar, in parallel because otherwise it would be Caesar himself! And that is why I decided to create a mirror! That will return a reflection! That will be the perfect reflection of the beauty of Caesar As in... As in a mirror! Where we can look ourselves in! Should I uncover it? Yes, uncover it! I am not worth of seeing myself in this mirror! I will leave it with Caesar in here! Dad! I hope that in from of this mirror you will find eternal serenity! Ave dad! Ave! Come on! Look yourself in! Come! Mirror assessor! Listen! What we need to do is to kidnap the druid and force him to prepare the potion for us! Oh! Really? With what? With the invisibility elixir! We capture Panoramix during the druid convention! Come on Edus! Drink! I must warn you that I have a little problem with my liver! That?s a pity! Is it painful? A little bit! Are you better from the liver? Much better! Then drink! What is this noise? Now go Edus, and kidnap him! No! No! We are going with him! And here is Numerik from Poland! My dear druids! Dear colleagues! I have invented the elasticity potion! I need four strong druids here! And now pull! with your whole strength! Come on! Pull! Well, that?s it! That?s what I call elasticity! What is the plan, anyway? Can you see the man we want? No! We mix, collaborate, circulate, observe, locate him! What do you mean? It?s not very easy! In this topographic point of view, it?s impossible! You can release me now! What is going on? It?s your dog! Asterix! Obelix! Asterix! Obelix! Panoramix has been kidnapped! An invisible force has taken your druid during the congress! I?ve never seen anything like it! An invisible force? Are you sure? As certain as I can see you! Obelix! If I give Idefix something that Panoramix touched, do you think he can follow his trail? He is mad at you! Mister Idefix, Asterix is sorry! Are you going now? What is necessary to smell? Go! Come on! Find Panoramix! What is he doing? He is asking the way to his friends! He got it! Don?t leave me alone! Yes, it?s a good idea! I have an audience! The man can get tired, but the artist must rest! Idefix, very good! Como to my lap, come on! Yes, Gaul? My dear friends! It was about time you showed up! No one harmed you? No, but the forced me to make the potion, but I told them there was an ingredient missing! I am kept in here, they will torture me! They are evil, and just because of the potion! You should give it to everyone that we could all be equal! this way I could participate! Obelix! You are a genius! If the Romans really want this potion, we are going to give it to them! That?s what I was saying! Primeirus! It?s the first time I enjoy sorcery! Well, I hope the druid does what I asked, otherwise I?ll have him slaughtered! Yes, but we need the secret! It?s fair! The guards? They are not here! The druid! Didn?t I tell you so? He made the potion! He was scared! He gave it up! He is a moron! But why did he leave us the potion? I don?t know why he left us the potion! He decided to leave, he was scared, and bribed the guards and that is all! It?s a trap for sure! You are right! Edus! Drink a bit! Me? Why not him this time? It?s fair! Aren?t you thirsty? I just drank some water! Come on! I am not feeling anything! You must hit someone! Who? Not him! You! Why me? Because I have been wishing to do it for a long time! Me too! No! Coveredinpus! Not with that! Only with your fists! Yes! It woks! We have the magic potion! I am going to win the Olympic Games and a heart! I will become the master of the world! Il maestro del mundo! Comandantore! The sand is humid! The terrain will be slippery! What are you doing? I am whispering in the ears of the horses! Maybe that helps! Seems like a good strategy! O.K.! Let?s go! Here they are! Want to make them disappear? It?s not easy to make this kind of animal disappear! Then you will have to eat them! No! Them ok, but not me, because I am the boss and all! Can?t we make a deal on this? No! Well, come on! Eat! You first! And now you two! Also the legs! Don?t speak, eat! It?s delicious! It?s quite good! May the sand be tainted with the blood of the losers! Ave Caesar! Don?t worry, daddy! Your end is near! Neared than you think! Alafolix! That must have hurt! Eh! Greek! The axis of your wheels is cut! You have a problem with the back wheels! Tchau! But that is not possible! You?re doing well, Michael, but you are only 2 sand grain in front of the rest! You are the best! Alafolix! Alafolix! Do you think it was a good idea to give the potion to Brutus? Patience, Obelix! Patience! Patience!? This way he will win! Faster! Ol?! What is he doing? He is going on the front and then stops!? Maybe they changed the rules! At the moment everything is depending on you two! Jean! I need to change the ruined wheel! O.K., change the wheel! We are doing a good time! Well noticed Michael! We have improved 3 sand grains! Bravo, people! What did you give to these four horses? Doubled hay? Goodbye, moron! It?s not possible! Look, without hands! Look at his race! I call that a circus race! Registered! I need the reserve horses! Quick! My love! Brutus! Irina! What is wrong? Thank you Jean! It was to encourage him! Obelix! What? Stop that car! Why? It?s empty! That?s the point! Come on, quickly! Here! It?s perfect! He cannot win Alafolix! We are on our way! Eh! Alafolix! Who are the champions? Is this wool? I can?t see him! Where is Idefix? I am sorry, Obelix, I was talking to him! Idefix is missing! It?s not my fault! I didn?t even sing! Idefix!? Praetorians, wait till the race is over! This is the plan: In the tribune we infiltration, siege, beating! And then I say it and you do not need to repeat it! You are under arrest! Who? We? No! Not you! Brutus? No, not Brutus! Alafolix! Alafolix! Jump! Here! Don?t forget, what is important is to finish the race! Thank you Asterix! Obelix, look over there! Look where Idefix is! It doesn?t look like a casual holiday crush! It seems serious! It?s a coup! Caesar is destituted! Brutus gets to power and cover us in gold! And us? I don?t think so! We talk about it when we come back! You heard that? It?s a coup against Caesar! Get me out of here! The helm is stuck! Calm down! Slowly! Greetings Brutus! Give me that! Open your mouth! It?s good, hum? Makes you stronger! Brutus! Brutus! Brutus! Well, Brutus won the Games! And Greece won peace! Caesar approves! He finds these Games quite entertaining! They won?t get me out of Milan, but one must agree they are quite good! Thank you sir! You are going well! Objection! Complaint! Protest! I accuse Brutus of using a potion that gives him superhuman strength! Who me? I cheated!? You are not well in your head, little Gaul! Brutus took no potion to win! First: I do not know how to make magic potion! Second: I do not know any druid that can make the potion! And third: I won, so... A princess cannot be promised to a cheater! I demand Brutus to be bug-tested! But on my free will, my love! I will make all the tests you demand! Sacrilege! The bugs are gone! It?s a pity! I volunteered myself on good faith! Don?t worry, Brutus! We don?t need the bugs for the testing! Our druid mixed a dye with the potion, to catch the cheaters such as yourself! This why your horses have blue tongue! Has yours... A blue tongue? No! I will not believe it! Brutus! If you want my hand, I demand you to show me your tongue! I can?t, my dear! It?s an obscene gesture! Brutus! Better than that! More than that! Hurray for the Gauls! We are the champions! The tongue? You knew and told me nothing? Oh, Mister Brutus! You did not win! But don?t worry, what matters is to participate! You need to calm down! Now is not the moment! Mister Brutus, there are some men that conspire against your daddy! And mommy! Dressed in black! Maybe he has some kind of problem? You have a moustache like me and I had never noticed it! You are under arrest! Oh yes, daddy! You will suffer the horror of succession! It was Brutus who was conspiring? Caesar is dead! Brutus is born! Long live Brutus! Long live Brutus the First! Stop him! I said arrest him! Primeirus! Arrest Caesar! These games are quite nice! They can really arrest us! When I said grab Caesar I made a mistake! I meant help him up! Ah! Yes! Hello! That is not a proper a slap, Caesar! What? You want to show him something? Can I? THIS is a slap! Thank you, Gaul! You must return to the small Gauls what belongs to the small Gauls! The race and the Olympic Games have been won by the Gaul-Romanic team! Thank you, public! The king Saragas has only one word the marriage of Alafolix and Irina is celebrated in great in the presence of a Gaelic village that made the trip just for the occasion, and by the rulers of the whole world! There you have! Three to Two! Numerobis! I didn?t know you were coming! Numerobis! Obelix! I am so happy to see you! My friend! It?s a pleasure to see you again! Panomanix! I am very happy to see you again!! Numerobis! Amsterimes! ixme! No! You didn?t say it! You know, there is something! You look prettier! No! Stop! Yes! You are prettier! It?s a pleasure to see you! And me too! You won the Olympic Games! Yes! We must tell you! We started bad in the Olympic Games and then... Miss Ascanonix! Numerobis! Numerobis! The personal architect of Cleopatra! Exactly! It?s important to refer that! Good day, Numerobis! Good day, madams! Please! Let the professional go through! I would like to introduce you a bard colleague! He is really good, you?ll see! Francixlalanix! Greetings Olimpix! I ask you to make a success out of him! My love... My gentlemen, let me present you the prototype for the ?foot on the ball?! I did tons of stuff in life! I built the Taj Malade! I don?t know if you know it! I could take you there! What do you have in there? Give it to me! What?s inside? There is nothing inside! It?s a cow stomach! It?s round! The Pisa tower! I?m sorry, I did it but didn?t leave it straight! It?s a concept! As a balloon! It will never work! If you want, I can build a nice home for our friends! Just for the fun! I really don?t care! Wanna see if it works? Asterix! Are you crazy? What was I telling you? Here you have! The racket ball! Are you a sportsman? Yes! Of course! You hadn?t noticed yet? Show me what you can do! Ok! With the ball! Ok! So, did you get excited? What about this? Not like that! What do you mean no? What do you want? Numerodis! We haven?t seen for a long time! Too long! You are Egyptian! How? I am not Egyptian! I just use this to look Egyptian! And the hair? Do you think it is correct to hide your beautiful hair? Yes! Hair is inside! Well, then give me the ball! Stop ruining my pyramids! It?s you who destroys the pyramids! I have a swing, look! You always have great swings! And we are ready for what? I found this and I am going to keep it! I am going to keep it! What a pity! Look at that! That?s not Olympic, that? It?s incredible what the guy does with his feet! It looks like he has done it his whole life! Because you can?t learn this! You want my ball? Then get it! This is good! Wait! I?ll call this ?hand on the ball?! Numerobis! It?s a pleasure! Give me my ball! Just look at that! It?s very dangerous do to that! Do you mind returning my ball? Tell me! Are you sure we are not arrested? Held preventively! Don?t stay like that! Ok! Ok! Yes! Yes! Give me a kissy! I?m not going to kiss you in front of everyone! Give me a kiss! There is no reason to kiss you! Give me a kiss, I?m asking you! We are not in Rome! Now! Now! These Olympic Games were not bad! Yes! It?s a pity you cannot do some hunting here! Brutus! You were going to cover us in gold! As a result, we are covered in sweat! I never said that! You understood wrong! Silence! Caesar need tranquility! To appreciate his imperial reflection! Eh! You two! Come on! Quicker and without a sound! You also, my son! Ave daddy! Ave I!
