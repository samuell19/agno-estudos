[roaring] [dramatic music] [radio chatter] [pop music] [suspenseful music] [chains rustling] [chime ringing] [suspenseful music] -We're closed, now. -You're not gonna play hero, are you? [whimpering] Right, or left? -Right, end of the jungle. -Wounded tigers always do that. [rooster crowing] [plane engine whirring] [melancholic music] -Is Hugo awake? And Lisa? -It's the same story every morning. [Deleye] Lisa? Eggs. -Boo. -Speak English, like everybody else. [pop music] Get your ass out of there. Breakfast is ready. Turn that off. [chickens clucking] What's the radio for? -News is on, sir. [Deleye] Turn it off and sit down. [suspenseful music] We first say our prayer. We still do. [screaming] [screaming] -Better not try anything. Hey, I said better not try anything. Just shut up and listen to me. [groaning] Sit still, or do you want to be buried today? The chair, for my friend, the chair! Nice, eh? A couple of guests for a day or so. My friend there is holding a 9 mm Parabellum. It makes a big hole. You could paddle through it. [suspenseful music] [phone ringing] [phone ringing] Oh. Hello. [phone ringing] -Yeah. It's Deleye. He ain't coming today. Sick, how should I know? Just sick! [Charlie] Do you have any pyjamas? [stuttering] -Pyjamas? [imitating stutter] -Pyjamas. Overalls off, pyjamas on. And relax. -Look. [gasping] Look what I have here. [baby crying]A fucking kid. -That's our Robbie. -Are you his mother? -No, she is. -And the father? [Sybil] It's all right, darling, it's all right. -I'm her brother. -Who gives a damn who your old man is. But I have to know whether the fuck he might drop in. Sad, huh? A whore for a mother and no papa. You want the brat? [Charlie] Yeah. [screaming] You just make sure nobody gets in our way while we're here. Or else... [baby crying] And you'll have a nice bloodbath, boy. -If anything happens to that boy, I swear... -It'll be on your own fucking conscience. [baby crying] -What's your name? -Lisa. -Okay, nurse. Come on with the doctor. [grunting] -Charlie six, this is six. All quiet, nobody inside. Zero, this is six. Move in. [groaning] -Come, nurse, you can faint on your own time. [suspenseful music] Well come on, sit on him. And hold his shoulders down. No, like that! [groaning] [groaning] [panting] [helicopter engines whirring] -No, no, wait! [baby crying] No, you're wrong! It's just maneuvers! [gunshots] -Maneuvers? Just maneuvers? [laughing] Yeah, in your front yard? [whimpering] [Charlie] Jim. What's that god damn noise? -The army having a little fun. Wait until they get to use live ammunition. They'll be shitting Technicolor. [explosions] [baby crying] [banjo music] -Hey, Dalsum. How are things going with him? -With who? -With Klipsteen. -Well what? -Well, gangsters at his place. -No reason to be scared. Not while I'm here. -HQ to sheriff, over. HQ to sheriff, over. -Yeah? -A telex came in, over. -Read it to me, baby. -There was an armed robbery in a casino near Pemberton. The haul, $600 000. [whistling] A little fortune, over. -A ranch down in Texas, a swimming pool for you, and a herd of cattle for me. [laughing] [Mrs. Dalsum - radio] Oh, you. They're armed and dangerous. Armed and dangerous. Drove off in a dark, blue Mercedes, licence number FT41BE. -What's that licence number? [Mrs. Dalsum - radio] FT41BE. [banjo music] [loud pop music] -Damn it. Fucking car. That kid, Jesus Christ. [Dalsum] Thou shalt not swear, Klipsteen. -Give me a hand, damn it! That kid's never sick, never! Now he lets me down! [buzzing] I'm not in! -He's not in! Who's letting you down? -Hugo, of course! -Sick? -So they say. -Who? -Who do you think? Where's that son of yours, I'm asking? Sick, he says, and then hangs right up. -What did he look like, that guy? -I told you that last night. -Tuxedo? -Yeah, tuxedo, yeah. -40-years-old? -Guess so, about 40. -And the other one, coloured? -Huh? -Coloured! -Don't know, I think so, he was sitting in the car. He just stayed sitting in the car. -Ah, wounded? -No, I'm all right, no wounds. -Not you, the other one! -Huh? -The other one! -Oh! I don't know. Maybe, I don't know. -Imagine, Klipsteen, you're wounded, and you can't go to a doctor, where would you hide? -Around here, you mean? Nothing around here. Woods, maybe. Or the swamp. Oh, Deleye, he'd see you coming. He'd blast you right off his land. [buzzing] [loud pop music] Turn that thing off. -They... They made off with $600 000. 600 000. -Where? -In a casino. They got off with the whole payroll. There was a shootout. -Not too much, though, it'll be too soggy. [glass shattering] -Try licking it up. -That was the kid's supper. -Just give him a breast and me too, you got enough. Where's that stud of yours? Huh? [Lisa] In my brother's room. -There's no future for us. You talk too damn much. [suspenseful music] Did you call them? You never heard of the police, huh? Those schmucks who bust you for jumping a red light. -Yeah? -Yeah! We always do, my friend and I, we jump all the red lights, you get it? -No. -No? There's a cruiser on your place, friend. How are you going to get rid of them? -I don't know. I'll think of something. -I hope so, for your sake. And for that rosy little buttercup of yours. [Deleye] Dalsum. Looking for me? -Not unless you're hiding something. [Deleye] Coffee or some whiskey? -Coffee and whiskey. And I wanted to say hello to Sybil. [Deleye] Well, you can say it in here. [mouse squeaking] Pour yourself a shot, coffee's on the way. -Look. Caught it by the tail. But I'm looking for two rats, one with a bullet in his gut. -Rats? What kind of rats? -Gangsters, Deleye. Really dangerous gangsters. Hi, Sybil. How you doing? -Okay. [Dalsum] And the children? [Sybil] Okay too. [Dalsum] But Hugo is sick, I hear. -Yeah. [Dalsum] What's the trouble? -He... [Deleye] Flu. -Your coffee. -Kiss the kid for me, okay? Say, Deleye. You steal $600 000 from a casino, and you end up here in a hole. What do you do? [Deleye] With 600 000? [Dalsum] Forget about the money, name me a hiding place. -I know of a hundred. -Exactly. -You want me to give you a hundred of them? -No, just one. The one I wouldn't think of. [mouse squeaking] -The old cabin. -The old cabin? Deleye, you want my advice? If you've got a permit, look after it better. Otherwise, it'll rust. [dog barking] -Execution cancelled. But the verdict still stands. -Jimmy. You're a fantastic surgeon. -Just wait until you get the check. -Have you... known each other for long? -He's called Jim. Just call me Charlie. [suspenseful music] -What if I... just walk out the door now? -That'd be very stupid. We'll be gone tomorrow. Or the day after tomorrow. -Where to? [Charlie] Far away, out of the country. -I have my own country. [plane engine whirring] -Don't they drive you nuts? I'd sue the army for a million and clear out. -This is my land! -You're one of those assholes who sticks in the same place all his life. Is this your whole fleet? Hey, does it run? -Why? -I ask the questions. -Oh yeah? -Yeah, or I'll grab that dried-out bitch of yours... and screw her ass off until shestarts bawling. Now, I ask you again. Does this shit crate run or not? Busted? -Expensive, guzzles too much. [Jim] Not busted. -I think it might need some parts. -Just leave the thinking to me. [engine coughing] Let's see what that shit face of a son has to say. [banjo music] [suspenseful music] [laughing] [footsteps] -That was as easy as pie. -Yeah. -In fact we used to call me theking of the poachers. [laughing] -I say, how are you going to cook it? -Just leave all the cooking to me. Rabbit or sheep, hey! [Dalsum] Morning, men. -Oh, fuck. -The two of you trap it, the rabbit? -No sir, no. -We found it dead, close by. -In a trap, it was in a trap. -And I said, "grab it!" -Well, that so? -Well, shouldn't we, yeah? -Is this your bivouac? -Everyone comes here. -All of the patrols. -To rest up a little, right? -Can we keep the rabbit? -I'm looking for a dark blue Mercedes. -Dark blue Mercedes? -Seen it? -No. -No, I didn't see, no. -Enjoy it. [laughing] -What was that, a cowboy? -Looked more like the local cop! [suspenseful music] [gun clacking] -What's wrong? -Nothing, sir. -What do you want to ask? -Nothing special. -No shit about a coffee break, huh? [Hugo] No, sir. -What's eating you, then? -The car's fine. -What? Like a rocket, right? -Yeah, like a rocket. [dog barking] -Get in there. [fox hissing] What's going on? First the cops, now the cavalry. -They aren't looking for you. They're coming for Lisa. -So. the bitch is the village whore, huh? -One day, I'll make you eat your fucking words, you bastard. -Make sure you get rid of those creeps outside. Or else I'll make you eat that fucking kid of yours for breakfast. Go on, move it. -Here we are again, with your permission. [suspenseful music] We've got a lot of canteens to fill on days like this. -I've no time for your bullshit today. -Sir. Sorry, my apologies. Come on, men. Speed it up. Let's go. [speaking a foreign language] -What's that lingo you're always speaking? You don't call him Robbie, huh? -Wenyomo. -Wenyomo. What would you call me? -Ramso. -Ramso? -From my country. I have my own country. Here, they all think I'm crazy. -Could I get there, to your country? -Only if you know the way. -Do you know it? -Of course. -Quite a difference from that deep freeze shit we get. Delicious. Is your drumstick good? Here, have a bite. You mean I disgust you? -Fucking queer. -I love you, shithead. Nobody is hungry? Hate to see it go to waste. [sigh] [dish shattering] -He can't sleep. -I was dreaming. -The bitch could've gotten away. -I was dreaming about you. -That kid's our insurance, remember. -I know that. And it'll stay that way, as long as we're here. [Jim] Leave that brat alone at night. -Everyone knows better. Even a gangster thinks he'll make a better mother. -That dame's nuts, totally. -She talked me to sleep. -Here, to keep you awake. And? You still in pain? -The dentist's is worse. -Dreaming about me? Well. -Yeah. I dreamt you were dancing. -Who with? -Alone. You were dancing, backwards. With a big bunch of roses. Red roses. -And then? [Charlie] And then I woke up. [dog barking] -Isn't it time for bed, Dalsum? -Just restless, Deleye. How are things? -Why? -No reason. -Since when do you cruise around with no reason? [Dalsum] Since there are gangsters in the area. [Deleye] If I see them, I'll ring you. -Hm... They weren't in the old cabin, that's for sure. -Sleep tight. [Dalsum] Good night. -You heard what the cop said. Good night, asshole. -Now go to sleep. -Listen. I know who they are. It was on the radio. They've got a pile of money with them, only I just don't know where. Out in the shed. I think. -What are you talking about? -Oh, nothing. -Hey. You mustn't try anything. They're not playing. That one is really dangerous. -Time to shut up, lights out. And no naughty games. [suspenseful music] -Can't you sleep either? I keep thinking of Robbie. You? Dear child. -If we all behave, so will they. God, if I get my hands on him... -I'd like to see that. [Deleye] Those soldiers today... That was my rabbit. -Your snares. [footsteps] [whispering] -They're not checking, look suspicious. [whispering] -What do you mean? -To make them suspect something. -Who? -Dalsum, that's who. Sly fox. -Dalsum? -Everyone tucked in? -Uh-huh. That asshole sheriff is looking for us. -Here? -No, not yet, but he's getting warmer. -Have you tried the car? -Tomorrow. When it's ready. -And the Mercedes? -Uh-huh. Dumped an hour from here. -We should give it a try tomorrow. -Forget it. One more day. You're the boss, but I'm the doctor. -We'll see. -I still feel the urge to grab that bitch. -She wants to leave. That's her dream. -The lady's a dope. Stupid. [Charlie] That's her country. Painted it herself. Not bad, huh? [laughing] -I tell you, that bitch is off her rocker! Bet she can't even screw. -Jimmy, do me a favour and go to bed. I'll stay awake. -Later. When I'm sure everyone's asleep. [dramatic music] [imitating a rooster] Beautiful, boy. A voice like a nightingale. Here, for your trouble. -You bastard. -Pick it up. Go on, bend down and get it, you motherfucking shithead. [gasping] I said, pick it up! There. You shouldn't throw money around like that. -If you weren't holding that damn gun, you'd talk different. -You want the damn gun? Here, take it. [glass shattering] While you're at it, make mine with ham. Eggs over easy. [troops, chanting] One, two, one, two, one two... -We've come to change little crapper, me and grandma here. -Where's Lisa? -She's no good at all, right, you horny bitch? Your daughter has two left hands. -I always wash and change him. -No wonder that girl wants to leave home. -Give us a hand. -I'd rather dance with your sister. -She's properly married. To a priest. -I serve God, in my own way. -Say that again. -I mean I set a bad example. -You were at it again earlier this morning, eh? [Jim] Those who won't learn must suffer. As long as we stay here, we're running things, is that right? -Be careful of that poacher. They're a venging kind. -With a soft spot. His little brat. -Go ask your sister if she wants another kid. -Another kid? -You hear me? Hurry up, I want a quick answer. [suspenseful music] Well? -No, she doesn't. -That's surprising. Usually, they beg for it. Get lost. [metallic tinkering] -If I'm wrong, Deleye, you can contradict me. The aim is "trap to stuff." Or else to eat. Not to have it rot away. Why don't you empty your snares, Deleye? -There are other poachers, around here. -Uh-huh. But no one's a real expert. A real pro. And a pro doesn't like sloppy work. -You seem to know a lot about poaching yourself. -Did she hit you, Deleye? -I married the wrong girl. -That I know, as long as I've known you. You can't tell fairy tales. I can. I'm even pretty good at it, too. One upon a time, two gangsters stole a bag full of cash. But on their way to the sunny south, something didn't work out. So they needed a hiding place, and they found one, too. Not in the old cabin. But instead, on a farm. And the folks there had a choice. Keep their mouths shut... or a slug in the belly. And to back up their threats, the gangsters handed out the odd nose bleed. What do you think? -I never like fairy tales. -I love them. -You through? -I've got to search your house,Deleye. -You what? -I'm going to search your house. -The bastard wants to play cowboy. One wrong word,there's going to be a bloodbath. -What do you know about the law? -Enough. I want to see a search warrant,in black and white. -You'll see it. In the mail. [plane engine whirring] [suspenseful music] Sybil, who did that? -Oh, that? -And your husband? Who beat him up like that? Hoodlums, maybe? [Deleye] I told you, I married the wrong girl. Didn't I? -Is this your room, boy? -Yes, sir. -You sleep here alone? [quietly] -Yes, sir. -Huh? [Hugo] Yes, sir. -What about that, then? -That's mine too. -But not when you're sick. -Sick? -Your boss says you're a real good mechanic. Is that so? -So they tell me, sir. -Do you have to do this now? The boy is sick. -That's right, yeah. He's sweating. Is that Lisa's room? -Yeah. And Robbie's. He's asleep. -I'll be quiet as a mouse. -If any harm comes to that kid... -Was that a slip, Deleye? -I mean... If he's startled by you. -Oh, you know who I am. The village cop. I adore kids. [dramatic music] Lisa. Do you like fairy tales? -Fairy tales? -Your step-father doesn't. In fairy tales, the big bad wolfis always in bed. But in this fairy tale, he might be underneath. You know where I should look for him? -In the woods. All right. [dramatic music] [suspenseful music] [Mrs. Dalsum - radio] HQ to sheriff, urgent, over. -Dalsum, telephone. That what's it called, that thing in your car. Squawking. [Mrs. Dalsum - radio] HQ to sheriff, urgent, over. -Yeah. [Mrs. Dalsum - radio] Where areyou, for heaven's sake?I've beentrying to catch you for hours. -Give it to me. [Mrs. Dalsum - radio] The darkblue Mercedes is in the village,over.Did you get that, over? -On my way. Over and out. A man can be wrong, Deleye. [Jim] He's gone. Like he had the devil on his ass. Does that cowboy have any reinforcements at home? he was called away by car phone. -That's his wife. -He's got a wife, him? Who would marry a big fat pig like that? You see yourself screwing that teddy bear? -Better the teddy bear than you. [dramatic music] [dramatic music] [chatter] [screaming] [laughing] [engine coughing] [typewriter clicking] -Where's that friend of yours? The black guy. -Black guy? What do you mean? -Just around the corner there, there's the bus stop. Leaves every half hour. -I was so hoping you'd do it, sweetheart, two real gangsters! -Yeah, yeah. Still, I must have missed something, but what, huh? -Hiding place, maybe... -I've searched just about everywhere. Down in the woods. And the swamp. The old cabin. And where do I find the Mercedes? Right there, god damn it. -Is that still your territory? -Of course, it's still up to me. Question is, can you hide out there? -It's just farmland, out there. -Those two can't have disappeared just like that. -I so wish I could help you. -Oh, not now! -It stinks rotten. -They say gentle hands make the wounds even worse. -Fucking amateurs. -Ah, shit! [suspenseful music] [gunshot] [baby crying] -Just fireworks, that's all. [dog barking] Here they come again, damn dogs in heat. Nice little income on the side, a cat house? -Why don't you ask your mother? -Bet it's got a nasty bite, eh? It doesn't bite yet, huh? Not yet. Get those bastards out of here. -What the hell happened to you? -You can go to hell. I'm sick and tired of all of you. -Lisa. Here, bring the kid. That's it. -Yeah, but I thought... that you said we could come here. -To fetch water, yeah. But not to leer at the girl every day. -I'm sorry about that. I didn't know. -That's all right then. Now you can beat it. -Good bye, sir. -You ought to jack off tonight to that admirer of yours. [speaking a foreign language] I admit that you're a tasty dish. -Jim, leave her alone. -Ah, fuck yourself. -There, there. There, go on. That's it, that's it. There, good boy. -It sure can go, eh? -Hope he kills himself. [laughing] [Jim] You assholes! [dog barking] You, how much gas you got left? -More than enough. -Fill her up and put her away. Trunk backwards. Hey. -Are you asleep? I know where the money is. -Don't do it. That Jim, he'll kill you for sure. Don't do it. -But I'd do it for you. For us. So we can get away together. -Well, able to stand on your own feet? -May I dance with you this time? -Who leads, you or me? -Me. -I'd much rather give you a lift. -You'd better sleep first, you've been up for 60 hours. -Come on. I'll drive you straight to Spain. -I'll wake you in time. -I won't sleep a wink. [dramatic music] -You have a gorgeous kid. Does he look like his father? -His father? Deleye is his father. -That poacher? -Where are you two going? -Far from here. [Lisa] Do you have a woman? -Sometimes. -Take me. -Who's going to wash the diapers? Jim? -Wenyemo would stay here. They say so every day. You leave if you want, we'll look after the child. -You have your own country. It's safer. Jim and I... we have only escape routes. Hiding places and escape routes. -But I can do lots of things. I can poach, shoot, drive a car. And make love. -Sounds very funny. Bonnie and Clyde. [Lisa] Who were they? [Charlie] The Romeo and Juliet of crime. [Lisa] Then that's all we are, Bonnie and Clyde. -Jesus, please, give me a handkerchief. I'm going to cry. -You haven't had three hours yet. -Your crap makes me vomit. -Is he angry, now? -He's my friend. [romantic music] -I can be yours too. [dramatic music] [glass shattering] [screaming in pain] [tools clattering] [groaning] [glass shattering] [metal banging] [groaning] [dramatic music] -What's up? -The fun is over. -The shit hit the fan? -That brother of hers. -Lute. -He's dead. -Where is he now? -In the barn, under the straw. -Dump him in the woods. That's all we need, a dead body. Shit. -What happened? -A little accident. -What are you doing here, Joe? -Why haven't I been relieved? -If it takes a week,you must never leave your post. -Post my ass. It's two hours on and six hours off! I've been there three hours! -Impossible. Damn it, this thing is busted. I'll have to report you. -Suit yourself. -You must think there's a war on. Bastard. Eddie, your turn. And double time! -Two hours, not a minute longer! -You'll be reported too! -Ass licker. -Put that thing out. It's visible for miles around. -And who by, huh? -Do you want to be reported too? It's up to you, brother. -A monkey gets a few little stripes, and immediately, he thinks he's an officer. [suspenseful music] -There's a... There's a dead... There's a dead body over there. -And there, I want C squadron to close the gap. Is that clear? -Yes sir, very clear. -I'm sorry to interrupt, Captain. One of our outposts has found a corpse. -Out here? -Yes, sir. With your permission... -One of ours? -No sir, it's a civilian. -Anyone know who it is? [a soldier] He was in the woods, near outpost Reader. -And who's there now? -No one, the post is deserted. -By you? -Yes, Captain. -You know that a post shouldn't be deserted, under any circumstances. -Yes Captain. -Court martial. -Dismissed! Forward, march! -I know that boy. He's from the farm. -The poacher's house? -Want me to go there and look around a bit? -This isn't an army matter, it's a job for the police. [police sirens blaring] Gangsters, you say? -Murderers. -Call in the guard or the riot police, what you like. The line is free. -They'll take hours to get here. I'm appealing to you, Major! -Just Captain. -All right, Captain, if I go in alone, there'll be a bloodbath. You just have to be there. With your troops. This is no time to go by the rules. Look, Captain. It's a question of life or death. There's also a baby. -Surely, you can radio him, Mrs. Dalsum? Just tell him that I called, and that he was right all along! -Those modern inventions, you don't want to use them, do you, Deleye? We want to keep our departures secret. [plastic shattering] [suspenseful music] -Huh? -Your taxi's out front, sir. -I appreciate it. [Jim] Could you please hurry? Our departure has been announced. [Charlie] Then the baby will have to stay with us. [drum roll] [Deleye] What the god damn hell are you doing here? -We've come to free you. -Get the fuck out! -Look, we know it all. And that your son... is dead. -Our son is dead? -No! [the soldier] We found him in the woods, I'm sorry. -You murdered my son! You murderer, you murderer! You murderer! -You fucking whore. [crying] -I'll kill you! Murderer! -Want some advice? Just turn around. Go and get some medals pinned on your pretty chest. While you can. -The game is over. The police are on their way. -I'll count to two, buster. Then you're dead. One... Two... [gunshot] [gunshots] [dramatic music] -Pity. I'd rather have you dead than alive. -You don't have me at all yet, fatso. -I'll count to three. Throw that gun down. One... -And then? -Then I'll have to fill out thousands of forms, on account of you. And I won't mind a bit. Two... [gunshot] [gasping] -There you are, fatso. You wanted it, you got it. [baby crying] -No, not the child, please don't! Please, no! Please, give me, give me, give me, please! Give him to me! No! [screaming in pain] [Lisa] I'm going with you. -We'll let him go as soon aswe're out of sight. [screaming] -Bitch! [Sybil] No, please, leave the child! [gunshot] [baby crying] [tragic music] [helicopter engine whirring] -This is the army. Give yourselves up. I repeat, give yourselves up. [gunshots] -Lisa, Lisa! [baby crying] [dramatic music] -Can't see a thing yet. Not a thing. We got them, south sector, block those side roads. I repeat, block those side roads! [tires screeching] [dramatic music] Block all side roads! I repeat, side roads in the south sector, block them! [dramatic music] Car now leaving our sector. Terminating action. Car now leaving our sector. Terminating action. [dramatic music] [metal thrashing] [explosion] [tragic music] [roaring]
