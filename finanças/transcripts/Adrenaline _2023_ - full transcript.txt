You should wait for reinforcements. Had I waited any longer, he would have escaped. You know me. Yes I do. And I know you're in dire need of a vacation. What? You can't take me off my job. -Bon Voyage. -You're such an asshole, Ben. don't call me I said that they understand English here. Of course they speak English at the airport, but wait till we're outside. -Hey! - Come on, be a little happier. She's just mad because we didn't go to Disney World. And there is no wifi. But hey, the website said that the hotel will have wifi. -Let's find a taxi. -Yes, let's find a taxi. Look, there's one for us. -Call a cab. -Yes, I'll call a taxi. Excuse me, do you want an Uber? -I'm free right now. - Sure, let's take that, yes. Toll. -Let me take this. -Thanks very much. This could be anywhere. This is the drive from the airport. What do you expect Steven? Wait until we're downtown tomorrow. You'll like it. I know. I think I expected something different. New York or some kind of Disney World. But it will be nice. And I'm going for it. We can always go there, but here probably only once in a lifetime. -Let's make the best of it. - Absolutely, and we will. Isn't that right, crumbs? Not quite yet. -Hello. -Hello. -We have reserved. -In what name? -Steve Travers. -Thanks. May I see your passport, please? -Very gladly. -Thanks very much. -Here please. -Understood. -Yes. Your passport and key card. -Thanks so much. -Enjoy your day. - Have a wonderful day. -And here we are. Come in. -Go in, sweetheart. -Hey... -Yes. -Done. -Finally. -Such a long flight. -You can say that. well I have to admit, this has a lot of charm. Wait until we're in Paris. Yes, but this is enough for the next few days. Honestly, do you really need this? Yes, you never know. - Come on, let's go eat. -Yes, that sounds good. -Okay, are you hungry? -Yes, I have. And after that he said somewhere in Ferencv√°ros or something like that. And do you remember that dude, I don't know, with the curly hair? I do not know. No idea. Anyway, he found his leg in Yishun. After that, they started putting the pieces together. Thanks. -Thanks. -Gladly. -What are you having, honey? -No idea. Something with chicken. And what do you take? Something typical from around here when the waitress comes. This is your dead cock. I don't know what you did with the tail. -Probably ate. -Keep that to yourself guys. -Hey, what's wrong with you? -I know the guy from somewhere. And then a foot and then the whole head. I recognize his face. No, not here! We are on holiday. You have no authority here. Do you know that? But of course. Let's take a picture. Smile a little. -Hey, who are you sending this to? -What do you think? I'm just keeping Lockwood in the loop. Vic, again, we're on vacation. -Don't you ever stop working? -You know me. Yes I know you. Are you ready? Can we order now? But sure. -What do you want, darling? -Cheese burger. Oh wait wait I want to take another walk down the street. Juliette is dead tired, I'm exhausted. Just ten minutes. I feel stuffed. -It does not take long. I really want? You don't know your way around here. I'll just go down the street and then come back. Yes, okay. I'm taking Juliette upstairs and I'll probably see you in ten minutes. Clear. Please. I'll be back in ten minutes. -Okay, bye, mommy. -Come on, dear. John Slater. -Agent Lockwood. -Did you see the photo? Hello Victoria. Yes, I have. Shouldn't you be on vacation? Never off duty. You know me. Yes I do. Unfortunately the man is on... John Slater. I remembered this after I sent the email. I'm going back to the restaurant now to keep an eye on him. Get the local police to arrest him for something. -Moment, Moment... -Was? I checked his record. We've known for a long time that he's there. We can't get any further with the local police. What? Why not? We have an extradition treaty with Romania. We recently had an arrest warrant. But unfortunately, we sent the address, but they could not find him. Allegedly. You mean he's got enough people under his belt. Looks like. But it can't be all of Romania, can it? Means? If we can lure him out of town, we could arrest him. Not good. The delivery would still have to take place via Bucharest. -Let him go. -Let him go? We can't get them all. You know that. What if he's roaming the streets of Bulgaria? Could work. No no no. Not. We're going to cross the border anyway. If I see him I'll call you. This is kidnapping. If you get caught doing this, we can't help you. It will work. Victoria, these are really bad guys. You don't even have a gun with you. I have my mints and my handcuffs. I never leave the house without her. think again And please don't interfere. I'll call you. You will. How are you? Are you waiting for someone? Thank god you're an American. Yes, my driver just canceled and I wanted to order a taxi. Oh no no no No. You don't need a taxi. See, well, without bragging, but this is my town. Wherever you want to go, I can help you. OK? -And? -And. -And where are you going? - Well, my car is right here. Get on board and we'll sort it out on the way. -Hey. -You seem a little drunk. let me drive Seems you drank too much though. And you know what? Nobody drives this car except me. Oh me? Hey lady, what are you doing? Do you know who I am? John Slater. I will take you to Bulgaria so that you can be extradited to the United States on all your warrants. No, no, no, wait a minute. One moment. I can explain. -I'm the good guy here. -OK. Of course you can explain that. And now get in the car. We have a long way to go. No no. Wait. Hey listen, I know people. OK? Yes, me too. -Hello? -Grab our clothes -and come down to the entrance. -But why? -Because we have to go. -But I have to pack. I don't care about our stuff. Grab the passes and come down to the entrance. Immediately. -Yeah, what's the point? -Good. Turn off the TV and put on your shoes. How come? Because your mother is screwing us again. We come! -What? -Hello Sir. How are you all? answer Damned. don't try Damn it, Steven! Steve! Fuck. Fuck! Juliette! Juliet! Juliet! -Hey! -Get out. Get out! Moment mal! -Where did they take her? -Slow. Wait wait. Wow. Who? Your friends have my daughter. I don't know. Which friends? The men you went to the restaurant with. These aren't my friends. Relax yourself. This was a business meeting. They saw me taking you, so they kidnapped her. Hey, one thing we have to clarify: I don't know the guys. This was a business meeting. I met her for the first time. You know your way around here. When will you call? How much will they charge? Wait a moment. No no. I think you misunderstand. They don't do that here. I think the whole thing is much worse. -Worse? -Yes. Well I've heard rumours. I wasn't sure if it was true, but maybe, I don't know. -What do they want? -OK. They want the organs. Okay, they take them from the kids for transplants. What do you do when you're done with them? I'm sorry, but there's nothing left when they're done. -Fuck. -No, no, wait, wait. I'm really, really sorry. OK? I have nothing to do with it. I don't know these guys and I hate her just as much as you do. -You will help me to find her! -How am I supposed to do that? -I don't know anything about these guys. - You'd better think of something quick! Fast! OK. The best I can do now is to go back to the guys, but I don't know what the point is. Then hope for the best. Okay. If you're kidding me, I'll run over you with your fucking car. OK. OK. Untie the cuffs, we have a deal. OK. Where we're going, the two of us together, I need my gun. -No way. -I need my gun. If they see me without them, they'll think you're a cop and we'll be shot on the spot. OK? yes, good You drive. The gun is under the front seat. She's loaded. come on, come on What are you doing? That would be a death sentence. I trust you so far. Jesus. she doesn't trust me Must be a cop. Shut up and drive! - Gott... - Mom, Mom, Mom! doctor! Bloody hell! Doc! -Put her in there! -With pleasure. -Mummy! Mummy! -Put her in there! Mother! Mother! Mother! OK. That's it. Are you sure? Looks closed. They do this on purpose so as not to attract walk-in customers. -So let's go. -Moment. Listen up... These guys are very dangerous. So keep cool, okay? -Stay close to me. -Do not worry about me. -Hey, Vassily. -Hey. how are you man Good to see you. First of all thanks for arranging the meeting with the guys. Could you maybe arrange one more? I might have something that interests you. -Who is she? -My business partner. OK? She might have something that interests her. No chance. No dealings with people who have not been verified. But she's been checked, okay? I vouch for her, so she was checked. Thank you for coming. I was happy to see you. No, no, wait a minute, man. I have been checked. That's how I met you, okay? Well, I vouch for her, man. Come on, it's important. The meeting with the boys went well. You must have said something cool about me. I'm right? "Blandju", translated "asshole". They used the word. Vasily, please. These men have my daughter. Help me. Oh, that's why you brought her here? In this case there is no other choice. Come on, do the right thing here. If she's with them, then she's dead. Just forget her! down! The magazine. Come on! Jesus... He must not escape. Damn cunt! -Where is the hiding place? -I don't know it. OK? You damn bitch! What? You're not a stone cold killer. I am a mother. Fuck you bitch! -Hey, are you okay? -Yes, I took care of him. I can not find him. We gotta find the guy, okay? -There's no way he can escape. -John, screw it, John. come on go Hop in! It's easy. -Lockwood. - This is Victoria. I have John Slater with me. Oh my goodness. What have you been doing He wants to go into the witness protection program. - Does he have something to offer? -some. All right, Mr. and Mrs. Some, go straight to the US Embassy. -We have to do something first. -But... Then it's done. You know, John, help me with my daughter and I'll stand the deal. -OK. OK. What next? -No idea. They knew the room number. Someone at the hotel must have told them. Yes, reception, this is your lane. Perhaps. Either way. Let's kick someone's ass! -Is that her? -Yes! Hey, hey, no, no, no. Do not even think about it. Come here. Please. We just want to talk. Come here. A little closer. Come here. -Where is my daughter? -I do not speak English. But you speak English. And I know that Hey look out! Screw us again and it's going to be very painful. -It's good. -Okay. Alright. I don't know where they took her. Who are "they" and where can we find them? I don't know it. Tell us where you met her. OK? A bar, on the east side. It's called "One Eye". I saw them there a lot, at some point they approached me. What about tonight? I usually tell them when someone is leaving. They've never kidnapped a child from the hotel. And this time you gave them the room number, didn't you? -Yes, I had no choice. -How many children have there been? - That's not important now. -How many? hey, leave it leave it, okay? That comes later. Now we have to take care of your daughter. -Trust me. -Good. -OK. -Give me your ID. -Yes. -Come on. I am sending a photo of this to a friend. Clear. If you tell anyone about tonight, you're dead. And your whole family will believe in it too. Clear. Fuck you all! -The asshole's cell phone. -Very good. is it locked -Yes. My people can unlock it. -We don't have enough time. Until they get it, there is no more information on the phone. It's worth a try. Do you know where the bar is? Yes, but I have a better idea. I know someone who can unlock the phone for us. -Can you trust him? -I don't trust anyone here. He's the best chance we have. Nice environment. Yes. I don't usually drive this car here but I guess that doesn't matter now. Or? Looks like. -What if he's not at home? -He's always at home. Okay. -This is Tony. -Hey, how are you, Tony? it's me hey what do you want Whats that for a question? i need information Come on. And who is she? Who she is? She is my yoga teacher. Come on, it's important. -Open up, man. - Fine, I'll let you in. Come on. -What do you want, John? -Hey Tony. Thanks. Well... well, we have a problem, and we thought that you were the only guy who could help us. -Honest? -Yes. So, hey, my cousin, here. And she has a seriously ill daughter, and the kid needs a liver real quick. And we're hoping that you might be able to help us with that, man. -You know what, John? -What then? I do not believe you. My daughter was kidnapped to remove all her organs. -Help me find her. -You, I think you. -Can you help us? -I did not say that. OK, wait a minute, Tony. give him the phone OK. -Listen, the phone belongs to a Vassily. -Oh yes, I know Vassily. Good. And you know when you unlock the phone you get a lot of important information. So come on man. We also asked Vassily for help. He declined. -Now he's dead. -Heart attack, right? I always told him Linguini would kill him. I check the usual suspects look at the search history and check his bank movements this week. -Thanks. -No guarantee. This will take some time. The main thing is that you try. Yes. I assume it will take a while and there's no guarantee I'll find anything. - Do your best. -All right. What can you tell me about the kidnappers? Okay, well, I met these guys once. -Two guys, Mihai and Andrei. -Oh yes, I know those guys. Nobody will miss them, not even their mothers. I can put you on the right track but these guys are really, really dangerous, so... I don't want to live if I don't get my daughter back. Well I do. OK? Just to clarify. If you examine this now, I want to live. Nobody cares what you want, John! -Okay, okay. -I believe her. Do your thing Tony. Understood. As I said before, this will take a while. Make yourself comfortable and sit somewhere. -No. -You can. Passe. OK. I sent a request for a heart. blood What blood type is she? Null. Okay, I'm sending the request for a heart now, delivery immediately. -We pay more. Double the price. -Will be done. -Do you think they bite? -Of course they will. These are business people. Greedy to the last. Then we hope for the best. But that won't be cheap. Okay. -Where is it? -There. -OK. The map should cover it. -OK. Okay. We have been outbid. That's going to be really expensive. Alright. How do we know they're not lying? Unfortunately not at all. Okay. -Put the amount on this card... -Okay. Wallet, my car keys... And I'll give you all the cash I hid. make it possible you've changed The knight on white horse suits you very well. Okay, the price just went up. OK. It's reserved for the next 12 hours. Okay. I'll take the rest of your card. You now have 12 hours. Good. Well done. Thanks very much. Tony, do me a favor. Tell them we're happy and ask them to send a photo. Immediately. Will be done immediately. Juliette. All right baby Mommy will get you. I can pull the phone numbers out of there and get their location as long as they haven't thrown away their phones. That's Vassily's phone, they should be in there. Yes. Wait a moment. I just remembered, That they have a brothel with Russian whores in the East End. This will probably be the easiest access point. -Could you please... -Yes, already sent you the address. -OK. -Thanks. Don't thank me yet Not until you have your daughter back. -Yes. -Hey, I'm sure you'll need this. Thanks. give me 24 hours After that I won't need much anyway. Please promise me one thing: finish these guys off. Nobody is allowed to touch children. - I guarantee that. -Yes. Alright, you better hurry because the original buyer is out there and he's going to grab another kid! -I don't see any cameras. -Maybe they don't want to attract attention. -Or they're broke. -Perhaps. -How's it going now? -Okay, listen, I have a plan. I'll go in first because they wouldn't open it for you. OK? If I go in there, I'll distract them. Meanwhile, you sneak in and put the gun to his head. Clear? If anyone moves, shoot them. -And that's your plan? - That's all I have. Fuck it all! Hello Hello. Stop, stop, stop, stop. Where to? Hello Hello hello! -Hey man. Very calm, very calm. -Where do you want to go? -What do you want? -Wait a minute, I'm Andrei's friend. OK? Andrei? He told me to come over if i want a girl And there I am. do you have coal Do you think I come here broke? Of course I have coal. Yes. Then give me the coal. OK. But only cash and only for one hour. OK? -Why only one hour? -One hour. -Do not even think about it. -Listen to her, asshole. Calm down. -Shut up! -He bites! What the hell... take his leg - That's my leg. -No, it's my leg with your leg. Crap... -Come on. -Gagge him, gagge him! -Can't you choke him? -I try it. -Gag him, damn it! -I try it. let me go oh my arm My arm is in there. Damn box! Oh you broke my arm My arm is broken. Not. Good. Come on, tell me you don't speak English. tell me The money is in the safe. We're not here for the money, we're here for Mihai and Andrei. Where are they? They come and go. You could shoot me but if I tell you where they are they will definitely shoot me. I'll take my chances. Are you taking a chance? Crap! -On the ground. -Yes, on the floor. Get down on the floor! Where are the IDs? I don't know it. - Do you think they store them here? -Slut! Oh my God. We'll get you out of here. It's okay, everything is fine. It's okay, it's okay. Is okay. Come on, come on, wake up! -How come? -Come on, let's go. You are free. Na, fate. -Wake up, wake up! -How come? -Wake up, you are free. -Wait. -Let's go. -What? -Come on. - Hey, we gotta go. Come on. Fuck. - Mihai? - Boss? We have a new order. For tonight. Tonight? Where can we get it? I have no idea. somewhere. From where you got the first one. We'll push our luck if we go there again. Last time we had to kill. Mihai, just do it dammit. -It's always the Romanians. -Boss, what can we do? -Yes? -Can you check something? Sure, send it over. Sorry, but that hasn't been used for the past few months. Okay, I figured out where these guys hang out a lot. I think I found something, but you have to hurry because they will surely find out that I am on their trail. All right, Tony, don't worry. what did you find out It seems they are hanging out at a strip club. The club is called Lascivious Lady. Are you kidding me? They're going to a strip club with this? No idea. Maybe one of her friends works there or they go from there to kidnap children. That's just what I was told, and you know that I'm risking a lot for you. And I really appreciate that. Do you want me to check anything else for you? Nothing, Tony, absolutely nothing. Call me if anything. OK? Bye. -Okay, well, hopefully it works. -Don't always think about your pleasure. Believe it or not, I'm not in the mood. Give me the keys, maybe we need to get out of here quickly. No no no. I'm the only one driving this car. -Even if you get shot at? -Even then. Then I'll just wait here. Juliette. Mom is coming soon. -Hey buddy. How are you? -Two drinks minimum. OK. My friends Mihai and Andrei told me about the club -and I'm trying to find her. -Two drinks minimum. Clear. Okay, look, if you know her, it's very important. I lost their phone numbers. Do you have it? -Two drinks minimum. -OK. OK. I'm sorry buddy. English? I'm looking for a buddy of mine here, Andrei. This is a private party. This is VIP area so piss off please. Okay, I don't want any trouble, okay? Andrei. Mihai. Does anyone know? No. No. Holy shit. That's enough! Exactly. That's it. go over it. Movement! you come here Come here. Come. Come come. ok stay there listen carefully I already killed one last night. It doesn't matter if I kill another one. -Where is Andrei hiding? -I do not know anything. -You know nothing? -I swear I don't know anything. -Oh, is that so? -Yes. OK. Well, I want to tell you something. Clear? Crap. No movement! go over there I have a bullet for each of you. You want to get another one today. Yes, to the hotel. You must stop them. That's not normal. -In order. Do we. -Thanks. That was the receptionist from the hotel. You want to kidnap a child today. Maybe she does have a conscience. I do not believe that. She just doesn't want to get caught up in the mess any further. Yeah, well, anyway, I don't think it's gonna be easy to rid the girl of these guys. -I know. - Yes, luckily I have a plan. But unfortunately you won't like it that much. -Let's take care of the guys. -We will. Don't worry. But we have to be clever. We need to find their headquarters. What? What about the girl you're trying to kidnap? She's gonna have a bad night. Don't worry, we're doing the right thing. This will not kidnap other girls. There they are. She looked very young. Just like Juliet. We do the right thing. We bring back the girl and she will handle everything just fine. -I promise we'll get her back. -OK. We're not in Beverly Hills anymore. -Let's wait. - Drive on slowly. What the hell are you doing here? -Where is my daughter? -She asked you a question. Fuck you all! you should have talked Juliette. -Who, who are you? -It's fine, my little one, it's fine. I will save you. Take her to the car. -Where is the girl? -I have forgotten. I'll ask again, then I'll shoot you. where is the girl I can not remember. Oh shit. Crap. Jesses. Crap. Crap. - Mihai. - Boss? They were at headquarters. I think they shot Andrei. What? Are you kidding me? -How could they even find it? -I don't know, boss. Boss, I need... I need to see a doctor urgently. -Is he there? -Yes, he is there. And when he's patched you up, you keep going. Okay. I'm thinking of something special for the bitch. Okay, Boss. -And now you go straight to the doctor. -Thanks. A few more will die today. -Hello? - It's me, Slater. Still alive? You must have nine lives. Listen, we found her. Mihai escaped. We managed to knock out Andrei though. I use his cell phone. Oh really? Okay cool. I will look for it. If you're lucky, you might be able to keep your car afterwards. That doesn't matter for now. Now we have to find Mihai. Check where this phone has been in the last few hours. Any place suitable for hiding. -Yes, I'll do it. It's my turn. -Thanks. That was Tony. He's just looking up phone numbers using GPS. -Okay, but time is running out. -He hurries. Only patience. we take you home Doc, I'm in pain all over. Then we'll see. -Yes? -We have the girl. -Thank God. -We're going back to the hotel. -What about the parents? -Yes, yes, yes, they are fine. They're scared to death, but it's doable. Yes. Okay good. We'll meet at the entrance. -So listen, your husband... -I'll take care of that later. No, no, it's not that. Someone came by and took the body away. -What? -I don't know who that was. Nobody official. Are you getting along? You stole my husband's body. -Who? -Who do you think? I'm sorry. What should I tell his parents? Tell them you had to prioritize. If you tried to save him you wouldn't have had time to save your daughter. Yes, if I hadn't seen you in the restaurant none of this would have happened. Yes, perhaps. Either way, I say: Take care of the living first, then the dead. Hi, Boss. Boss, one of the girls escaped. What should I do now? Let me think. Oh my God. Are you all right? -Oh my God. Are you all right? -I'm doing well. -Are you okay, yes? -Nothing bad is happening honey? No. The people in the car saved me. My little girl, come here. We have to say thank you. Don't worry, you won't feel anything. -Today is a good day. -Yes, it is. Maybe not for you. As a surprise for the mother, the boss wants that we film the entire operation. You can choose: with anesthesia or without. It's gonna be the worst pain you've ever had. What's your choice? No no no. Not a step further, man. I know your gun is unloaded. You think I don't know how to reload, asshole? Total idiot, but not your gun. -Where did you get the bullets? -Where did I get the bullets? Yes. Where did you get the bullets? Crap! OK, find your daughter. I'll take care of this guy. Come on, go, go! I hit him on the head... And! Hey, what are you doing here? I'm her mother and I'm taking her with me. I don't think so. I'm not letting you run away with 200 grand. Never mess with a mother. Juliet, Juliet. Thank god. Juliette. Juliette. Everything okay. mom is here -How is she? -You're fine. She's just stunned. OK. Crap. Let's get away. Come on. You can't imagine how I hate this unloaded gun. -This will kill us. -What you wanna do? I have a plan. This bitch cost me a lot of money today. Yes, the damn whore. Let me finish her, boss. -Is that your plan? -Do not you like him? Fuck it all. Yes, fuck it. Let's do it. Victoria, it's over.
