VIDAL ESTEVEZ directed by M. VIDAL ESTEVEZ Chamartin Station Long distance - Commuter Train Perhaps they were hard times. I don't know. In any case, now after such a long time they don't seem that hard anymore. They weren't any easier or harder than nowadays. Life is made of dreams, and we make those dreams. Now I know that as much as one wants to force reality, it obeys its own rules, not according to our wishes. But I don't want to regret a thing. I don't want to talk about big losses either. I just want to admit that some times, more frequently than we suspect, we sink in mediocrity out of despair of the beauty we have dreamt. Nobody told us, and we couldn't see it in time, that illusions must be destroyed to change the circumstances that require illusions. That's why I'm only going to refer to my personal experience. To my most intimate story. How and when a friendship is born is something that generally can only be explained afterwards. The causes are much easier to determine, at least the most evident, that motivate the end of a friendship. This is what I'm determined to do. To explain why I'm here at Chamartin Station, ready to see him show up to kill him. The first time I saw him I didn't like him at all. Not only he was late to the meeting, but he also had a peevish smile the whole time. Like he didn't care about anything we talked there. The matter we came to discuss in that gathering, was one that me and my partners thought was extremely serious. That afternoon of an early September '75's day, we where there to coordinate some actions to avoid the last bloodshed of the dictatorship. We dreamt of saving the lives of some anti-Francoists militants who were very probably destined to death sentences. His attitude bothered me so much, that I almost asked him as vehemently as possible what he was laughing at. As someone educated by the Jesuist separation of good and evil, I've always believed that serious matters should be treated seriously, and only take informal matters lightly. He remained quiet in his chair with his mischievous smile He casually watched the scene while the others: representatives of political, citizen and professional parties along with others, independent like me, had tedious discussions full of casuistry and many historical interpretations. Yes, I almost asked him what the hell he was laughing at. What was so entertaining about that twitchy meeting full of bad omens. But I didn't. Maybe because deep down I sympathized with his ironic skepticism or to avoid looking foolish in front of my colleagues. We both kept attending the meetings. I watched his attitude, while he simply smiled the whole time. He never talked in any of the meetings. He didn't take notes, either. Then, I lost track of him for a while. We couldn't or we didn't know how to avoid the assassination of the five people that were the reason why we met in the first place. Did he already know that what we were aiming for was impossible? I don't know. But that is what I asked myself when I heard the news about the executions. I remembered his smile and I wondered. From that moment I wanted to see him again. To meet him. The first elections were held. Franco had died in bed. The countdown started for what was going to led many to disenchantment. When forgetting served as a therapy against the rebellion of the memories of a time when we still thought things could be different I had just entered a cafeteria where I was meeting a director who was preparing his first film and could employ me, when I heard a voice from behind calling my name. I turned thinking it was my director, but surprisingly it was him calling me while making a fuss. He made me come over to a table he was sharing with a girl. and despite my complaints he convinced me to sit. The director hadn't arrived yet, and I thought there was nothing to lose by accepting his invitation. Like so many other times in my life, I was doing what I didn't want to do. He introduced me to the girl as a friend, and started enumerating my qualities as an actor very eloquently. He'd just seen a film in which I played a very small role, and he didn't stop praising my acting. While the girl left us briefly, he asked me if I was still into politics. I answered him that not as much anymore. "I left politics forever." He said it like the most absolute truth. After a long silence he said: "You know why I called you?" "I've called you because I need you to lend me some money." He saw the surprise and perplexion in my face and said: "I've met with that girl, bought her lunch and realized I didn't have enough money, until I saw you there." I was going to excuse myself when he interrupted me: "You wouldn't let me down just for a couple of bucks, right?" I took all the money I had in my pocket and gave it to him. "Thank you kid, you saved my life." He said while patting me on the back and added: "Give me your phone, I'll call you to return it." What made him work in politics for a while is something I will never know for sure. Every time I asked him, he gave me a different answer. No doubt about it. I was the actor, but he was the one who was performing. The director I was waiting for came into the cafeteria. I had to say goodbye. I did it with a vague gesture of my hand. "Don't worry, I'll call you." He shouted, while I was already next to my possible director. He had made a couple of short films, but this was the first feature film he was trying to make. The plot was about an old filmmaker on the verge of death, that was making his last film and was being blackmailed by some photos, that showed that he wasn't the director he pretended to be, but an old cinephile who had aspired his whole life to direct without success, and after discovering his resemblance to the real director, killed him in order to impersonate him. That's what I can remember. And I was, or should have been, the blackmailer. The young man who discovered the fake identity of the old cinephile. My discovery was not only motivated by my cinephilia, but because I wanted to obtain money by any means necessary. Even through some photos of doubtful nature that allowed me to get my full salary and then some more, from that old director. The film was never made. Like many other times, the production failed. Finally, not to pay me back the money I lent him, but under the pretext of going for a walk with him, he kept his word and he phoned. I went to the appointment with the hope of recovering my money and to go for a walk. But while I didn't recover my money, we went in the following days and weeks for many walks. We went up and down, without any apparent motive. We spoke of many things. We had some drinks. We met his girlfriend. The three of us went to the cinema. We stayed up late. We did this day after day, in a never-ending sequence. What did he do for a living? That was something vague he didn't like to talk about. He met many people. He handled lots of money. He lived in hotels for short periods of time and he changed cars frequently. I started to think he was into shady business. Drugs, currency trading... It was his life and he could do whatever he wanted. "Sex and money is all that matters", he lectured me incessantly. I nodded not too convinced. And he patted me on the back like I was his disciple. One day he said to me: "I have to propose you something." "Something?" I asked. "Yes, something. But you have to promise me you won't be shocked or put on a number." "Do you promise? Say: I promise." "Alright. I promise." "I want to commit a robbery. I need a partner and I want you." There are some people that it is said they could even sell ice to the eskimos. And he was, and still is, one of those. He sold me his robbery. I saw it as a magical "all or nothing" way to either solve my problems forever, or confirm my failure once and for all. How did the robbery go? I better not go into much detail. I will say I didn't have any problem to play the role he assigned to me in his plan. He gave me a gun, repeated many times what I had to do, went to the place and committed the robbery. That was all. The problems came afterwards. In the stampede after the robbery he took the money. We agreed to meet the next day to share the money. But the time of the meeting came, and he didn't show up. I called his girlfriend and she didn't know a thing. I went to the hotel he was staying at and he had already left. I had seen the same thing so many times in films that I never thought that could happen to me. And when it did I tried to convince myself it hadn't actually happened. That it was just a bad performance for a film that would never be released. His girlfriend and I went to live together and comforted each other. But it didn't last. We got separated and only met from time to time. We made love and tried to keep our anger towards him from getting cold. In bed, we got horny by thinking, imagining, representing how we would kill him. Now I know that all the pleasure we obtained from those games and violent physical and verbal expressions, we owed that also to him. Without his memories or his image, we wouldn't have enjoyed sex as much. But that wasn't everything. I don't know how, but the police... used me as a scapegoat and I spent some time in jail. While I was rotting inside, I read the newspapers and thought. I couldn't do a thing. Just waiting. And I waited. And while I was waiting my thirst for revenge grew bigger and bigger. I firmly promised myself that I was going to make him pay for everything he was putting me through. Paradoxically, my story allowed me to find a job as the lead actor in several films. So, while he acts in real life, I emulate him in fiction. That's why I'm here. Yesterday, when she phoned to tell me he had called and said he was arriving today by train, I knew my time had come. Listen: the public address system is announcing the arrival of his train. I get up. I go down the stairs to the platform. I see his train arriving. I hide behind a column and watch how the passengers come out. He is one of the last ones to get out. Always with that smile and his naughty childish expression. If I've ever been certain of something, now I'm not. Each time I look at the past, I see it in a different color. I find curious that memories appear to me without any background. I only see isolated faces completely unrelated and sceneries where nothing has happened and nothing ever will. But the past never forsakes us. Some say that being able to forget is being able to survive. I think that the worst part about forgetting is that sometimes it includes memory. But he is there. Right in front of me. I want my armed hand to come out of my pocket. He hugs me and tells me how happy he is to meet me. I thought killing him was going to be as easy as killing Jack Palance, Richard Whitman, Robert Mitchum, Robert DeNiro, Bruno Ganz or any other. But it hasn't been that way. He waves goodbye and I can see him walking away. That's when a kid who has recognized me points his finger at me and shouts: "Bang, bang!" I smile at him and take my hands to my heart, as if he had actually mortally wounded me.
