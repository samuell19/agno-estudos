Brother, why are you so worried? It's an auspicious day. Well, I don't have to worry as long as you're here. I'm just a little nervous. You're the one giving him advice? You remember, when Jassi was to be born, you were petrified. You kept walking from here to there. Dad, to be honest, I'm feeling the same way. He had no one to talk to. But I've been asking Jassi if it's going to be a boy or girl. - But he doesn't tell. - It's futile asking him. He won't tell. Sir, Jaddi is a Sardar's son. It won't be so easy. He'll speak only when he feels like. Idiots! A child always calls out to his mother first. Nothing else. He'll say 'mother' too. This is not done. He's with me all the time. He will call out to me first. Sir, congratulations! It's a boy! There you are! Congratulations! Well done, sons! You've made me very happy by giving me grandsons! Sir, this means the neighbouring villages will get the news.. ..this year, on 'Lohri'. - Gogi. - Yes. It's my brother's son. It's a big deal. Forget about the neighbouring villages.. ..I'll spread the word in the whole of Punjab. That would be good. My dear child. His aunt has carried him, he's mine now. Really! Shera, your son looks nothing like you. He's much more beautiful. Don't you dare tease him! Right, Sherry? Absolutely, Sister-in-law. - Here, hold your son. - Watch it. Careful. Careful. Dad, all said and done, it's a great feeling to be a father. - Just hold him. - Give me. - That's true. - Here. Take it. My sweet child! My sweetheart! The children are drinking milk. Before they are done drinking it, I want my first tractor. Do you understand? Hey! Don't worry, Dad. We did shoot a few of his men. But we will send money to his family every month. Great! Wow! That was a good one! It went quite high. This is nothing. When I hit a shot, it reaches the other village. - Don't boast. - Don't boast. Okay, then, the next lane. - Don't boast. - I'm not boasting. Come on, agree. Brother, when you get married, we're going to have a blast. These firecrackers are nothing. We'll light countless firecrackers. The villagers should know that it's Jassi's brother's wedding. It's not an ordinary affair. Listen, Brother! When this one gets married.. ..and his sisters-in-law ask for a token to cut the ribbon.. ..it doesn't matter what they ask for, we'll give them Rs. 21,000. People should know that it's Jaddi's son's wedding. Right? Friends, our village has been holding.. ..tractor races for many years now. I welcome all the gentlemen present here.. ..the chief guests, and all the young men.. ..participating in the race. I think everyone's waiting for a special person. The wait is finally over. Those two young men have reached the ground. Well, the sons of Jaddi Sardar.. ..have reached the ground. On one hand is Jassa, and on the other hand, Jeeta. The competition will begin. We will soon have a winner. The silencers of tractors are emitting smoke. The boys are all set. Just some more time until the race begins. And the race starts now! - "They have the same style." - It's equal! "Nothing can separate them." Wonderful, boys! You two are great! - "They are inseparable." - Well done, boys! I knew it! This has been happening for the past five years.. ..and it's happened again. Both the sons of Jaddi Sardar have won the race yet again.. ..like they have been winning for the past five years. A huge round of applause for them. I request the chief guest to honour the winners.. - ..bless them and say a few words. - Greetings! A huge round of applause once again. Wonderful! You're too good, boys! God bless! I had heard that strength lies in unity.. ..but I witnessed it today. I'm so happy to see such love between cousin brothers. I bless you that you to stay together always. "The others hold no place before us." "When Sikhs fulfil friendship, it becomes a memorable one." "We defeat death. Death!" "We defeat death! We make a name for ourselves!" "We rule the world. We can't be tamed!" "We rule the world. We can't be tamed!" "Those who leave the battlefield are weak." "They give up before the circumstances." "They give up before the circumstances." "Those who fight the circumstances.." "..emerge victorious and leave a mark." "Emerge victorious and leave a mark." "They have no knowledge of weapons." "They have no knowledge." "They have no knowledge of weapons." "They are weapons themselves." "We rule the world. We can't be tamed!" "We rule the world. We can't be tamed!" Our sons won again. Thank the Lord. Both of you are together. Are we going to get food tonight? I can't help it, Father-in-law. Sister-in-law Sukhi doesn't let me work. She wants to do everything on her own. Look at you! Why would you work when I'm here? I'll manage everything. And cooking isn't a big deal. I'll cook in no time. Tonight, we won't get what we like. Our sons' favourite food will be cooked tonight. - Dessert is being prepared. - Yes. And they deserve it. They've won, after all. Yes. That's right. Come, let's make Rotis for father-in-law. - Yes. Let's go. - Come. You make the vegetable quickly. I'll knead the dough. - Dad, I wanted to talk to you. - Yes, tell me. - There's 10 acres of land available. - Okay. It's worth 20 lakhs. Do you want to buy it? Sure. There's nothing to think about. We'll buy it. I've paid the token amount. We'll pay the remaining tomorrow and get it registered. Okay. - Greetings, Brother. Greetings, Dad. - Bless you. - Well, I need to talk. - Tell me. Bachan Singh came to the farm today. He's offering a piece of land for Rs. 30 lakhs. I said yes. We'll pay him tomorrow and buy it. The same is available for Rs. 20 lakhs. He's paid the token amount for it. We'll buy it tomorrow. But Dad, I've given my word. It's set in stone. If you've given your word, we'll buy it tomorrow. But Brother, you've paid him the token amount. Silly, I've only paid the token. But what you've given is more valuable than money. My brother's word is greater than anything. Thank You, God. I swear, Brother. I pray to have you as my brother in all my lives. I won't find a brother like you. "We're calm men." "But if someone tries to mess with us.." "..we can teach them a lesson." What's wrong with you? I'm already late. Why don't you start? Turn it off. Here you are. - Hey, what's wrong? - It broke down. I told you, this isn't a child's play. - It's difficult to get it repaired. - Yes. Why don't you make it fall and try to start it? This isn't a light scooter. How can I make it fall? You should have bought a light scooter instead. It would at least start. Once, the tractor broke down. I made it fall and then started it, and it worked. Dear Lord! You'll be sinned. - You must have heard the idiom. - Which one? It looks good, but always buy things that are convienent to you. - He's talking nonsense. - You never believe me. I shook it a little and it started. Don't boast early in the morning. I'm getting late, I have a match. What nonsense! Will the match wait for you? - Come, I'll drop you. - On your tractor? Of course, the tractor is better than that. - All right, then. - Girls in college! - Give me the key. - Here. Take this, park it inside. Park it wherever you want. There are no girls in my life. - Okay. - Okay. "If someone comes for you, I'll fight the world." - "Come on, let's get going.." - Nonsense! Does it start from here? Hey! It started! All right, let me take a round! Brother, my friends are looking. Do I look weird in a tractor? Why did you take a lift then? Stop right here. Don't take it in. I can do what I want. Wait and watch, I'll land inside. They'll stop you. Hey, they saluted you! They are like us. I'm getting a call. I'm here. - What is it now? - I'm coming. Leave the phone for some time. All the time.. Oh, God! Excuse me. Are you blind? How could you just jump? You scared her. He's so shameless. Let's go, Roop. - Yes? - Let's go. - I need to go to class. - Fine. I'm going. This is too much. This is not done. This wasn't fair. It's a big deal. What's the matter? Why did you call for the council? We could have talked amongst ourselves. How could we have talked? He abused publically. Now the council will take a call on this. I abused, I didn't kill anyone. Hey, it's the council! - Greetings. - Greetings. Greetings. Greetings. No one is allowed to raise the voice here. - Greetings. - Greetings. Yes, gentlemen. Tell me, what's the matter? I'll tell you, sir. At the bar last night, these two had an argument with Pindi. It escalated and they abused Pindi. Pindi wants justice. He was abused publically. He said he was drunk. He didn't realise it. Then tell him that he should drink only how much he can handle. If he misbehaves with people in a drunk state.. ..it will not be tolerated. He just abused him. What's the big deal? A true man often abuses. Don't insult your family name by abusing. A true man works hard, he does not abuse. If you are so hot-blooded, go toil in the farm. Why do you make the labourers do it? Join the army. You're trying to tell me what a true man is! He's become a teacher now. Without much ado.. ..Kanta, tell them to apologise to Pindi.. ..and make sure this does not happen again. Sir, what if I say that my brother won't apologise? You're in the council. Or else, by now, your brother would have fallen at his feet.. ..and apologised to him by now. We should have hit him instead. I made a mistake, Pindi. Forgive me. I made a mistake, Pindi. Forgive me. One more thing. We share an old alliance with your family. Hence, I'm being respectful. Be careful. Okay? All right, then. I'll leave. Maintain peace, everyone. - Okay, gentlemen. - Bye. - Greetings. - Greetings. Greetings. 'Headman, you got away today.' 'The day I get you.. ..I won't let you go.' - Listen. - Yes? Get a glass and some water. You've come drunk already. That's enough now. What are you so angry about? Don't argue, just do as I've said! What is it? Why are you scolding him? You didn't raise your voice when you should have. You became a scaredy-cat. You're trying to act smart here! Just ask her to go in. Stop irritating me. Go in, Mom. I'll calm him down. Right. He'll drink and calm down now. That's why no one wants to marry off their daughter to him. Why do you say that? His alliance is fixed now. We'll have a blast at his wedding. As if any alliance is going to remain, seeing your behaviour. You had an argument with someone and you abused. Moreover, you're going around apologising to people. It was my fault, not his. And he didn't apologise. We apologised because of Jagtar Singh. He has made our lives miserable already. I thought my sons would take revenge. I wish I had two daughters instead of you. Just wait and watch, Mom. We will make him pay for this. Get lost! You couldn't even win the tractor race.. ..and you want to beat them! Just shut up, Mom! I'll shoot you! Shoot them instead, who shot your father and ruined us! He's on the bed for years. He's like a living corpse. Shame on you. Get lost! Mom. Mom, they shot dad and put him on the bed for good. But I'll shoot them and put them on their death bed. He'll be proud of me. You'll be proud of your son. Wake up, we've reached college. Go and study. I agree you're elder, but it doesn't mean you can boss around. You must reach college on time. If you get late, it's your loss. We must reach on time, not before time. It starts at 9. It's still 8 a.m. When I was in college, we used to reach college at 7 a.m. We used to settle down first.. ..and then we would go to class. You know nothing about it. Your master always took short lectures. Those who don't get alcohol spread those rumours. Ask those who got it. Go on, then. Study. I will study. But I know what you're doing these days. Excuse me. What will you study? Take your books. Come home on time in the evening. - Just go. - Don't loiter around. Where is she? Let's go. Oh, God! Why does he come? Doesn't his family stop him? Yes. They consider this a matter of pride. Nonsense! Leave now, or do you want admission too? I'm going. Why are you spying on me? Trying to act smart! Come home and you're done for! What's wrong with him? All of you have come together? Well, the matter is, on your saying.. ..we started the work to build a home for the old and helpless. Most of the work is done. Some more work is pending, but we've run out of money. If you could ask the minister to release the money for the grant sooner.. ..we'll get done faster. You know that the work in our village has never been.. ..dependent on government grants. We started this on our own. So, we have to complete it. Swaran Singh, how much would it cost? Around 4 lakhs. 4 lakhs? It's okay. - My elder son will take care of 2 lakhs.. - Okay. - ..and the younger one will manage the remaining two. - Okay. That's it. This is a good deed. It should not be interrupted. And you know the current situation. - Children don't take responsibility of their parents. - Yes. At least this will help. Swaran Singh, you should contribute too. God knows what the children are up to. I have a few fixed deposits. The one who serves me will get it. - I can contribute Rs. 50,000 too. - Okay. I'll teach you a lesson. No! - Don't.. - Hold on! Listen to me! I'll thrash you! Come here, you! Come here! Why are you after him? What's wrong? Ask him, not me. He'll tell you. - Well, I just.. - What is the matter? What happened? Why are you after his life? How should I tell you? It's obscene. Just leave. What's obscene? - Tell me. - I can't. It's derogatory. I can't tell you! Dad, for God's sake, don't tell mom even in private! - Stop it! - You idiot! Hold on! Tell me! - What is the matter? - Tell me. Go home. I need to tell him about it. - Stop hitting my son. Tell me later. - Go on! This idiot box that he's roaming with, that mobile.. ..contains obscene stuff. - Hey! - It's not mine. You know our friends' group. Someone sent it on it and it got downloaded on its own. That one! - What group? - Both of you are in it too. - You want to download HD videos! - You! You rascal! - You're putting the blame on me! - Get him! Don't let him go! Get him! What should I watch? Well, no matter what I watch, it's all the same. But one thing's for sure. There's nothing better. I think I should sleep. I have to wake up early. This is wrong. When I open my eyes, you disappear. I won't open my eyes now. "Beautiful girl, I won't leave your side." "You're mine, and I will be yours." "You own my heart and soul." "I won't utter anyone's name but yours." - How much does a glass cost? - Rs. 10. - Rs. 10! - Yes. They charge Rs. 10 for two glasses in our village. We charge Rs. 10 per glass. You better drink it in your village. Isn't that too much? - Is it? - Yes. - I'll tell you what, divide one glass by two. - Okay. "Beautiful girl, I won't leave your side." "You're mine, and I will be yours." "Beautiful girl.." "I've never spoken to anyone other than you." "You come to my dreams every night." "My car seat is waiting for you." "I'll take you on a drive. I'll make you mine." "You'll have fun with me. I'll take you in my arms." "He who loses is not a true Jatt." "If you don't accept me, I'll pick a weapon." "Beautiful girl, I won't leave your side." "You're mine, and I will be yours." "Beautiful girl.." He's started following you every day, Roop. Why do you look at him? Just drink it. - Here. - No. Why not? It's good. We're getting free drinks. - Let's go. - Roop, let me drink at least. So, did it work out? Or is it still the same? I'm just asking. Please come. Bhanu, get water and tea for him. - Coming. - Come, sit. Dear, get water for your dad. Bring some biscuits too, dear. So, tell me, what's the news? - Everything's great. - Greetings. Greetings. Look, Gogi Singh, they saw your girl. Here. They like her too. It's a yes from them. - Thank God! - But there's something. Look, I will give dowry as per my capabilities. It's all for my daughter, after all. But if they have any demands, let me know. Go, Gogi, I'm not talking about dowry. It's a sin. We are against dowry. I meant, the boy's family wants the wedding to happen soon. But how can I make arrangements at such short notice? Listen, just say yes to them. - It's a yes from us. - You.. Okay, then. I'll leave, Gogi. Goodbye, ma'am. - Goodbye. Greetings. - Greetings. - Why did you say yes? - Don't worry. I'll tell you what, talk to the master first. We'll find a solution. yes. - Master? - Yes. Go. Okay, I'll talk to him. Sir, I've fixed my daughter's alliance. - That's great. - Yes. Congratulations, Gogi. Congratulations to you too. I just need your blessings now. Please help me. We can't help you. Don't say that, sir. I've served you all my life. You've fed my family. - Whose daughter is she, Gogi? - Mine, sir. - Then you should get her married. - What? Sir.. Who is your daughter's brother? My son. She considers your sons as her brothers too. So, then, that makes her our daughter. Gogi Singh, tell me. How are you going to contribute at our daughter's wedding? I? What can I do, sir? Whatever little that I have has been given by you. I've been saving it, and that's what I can give. Save it for your old age. She's like a daughter to us. She'll marry in our house. We'll get an excuse to celebrate too. We'll have a blast. You're all so great, sir. "Boys, listen to what I have to say." "Boys, listen to what I have to say." "You've been blabbering like a pigeon." "This isn't your cup of tea." "Watch me. This isn't your cup of tea." "Watch me. This isn't your cup of tea." "Your wig is from Lahore." "You steal my heart in broad daylight." "Your wig is from Lahore." "You steal my heart in broad daylight." "I feel happy to see you.." "..when you dance." "I am amazed to see you.." "..when you dance." "I am amazed to see you.." "..when you dance." "Flowers learn to bloom from you." "If you could, you could enchant the whole of Punjab." "Your tantrums are amazing.." "..when you dance." "I feel proud to see you.." "..when you dance." "I am amazed to see you.." "..when you dance." "Our moustache is our pride." "You have to come to my house someday, girl." "I'm proud to see you.." "..when you dance." "I am amazed to see you.." "..when you dance." "I am amazed to see you.." "..when you dance." I don't understand. He hasn't eaten since two days. I wonder what's wrong. He doesn't even speak. Greetings, aunt. - Greetings. How are you? - I am fine. Aunt, where's brother? In his room. He hasn't eaten since two days. I wonder what's wrong. You make the same thing every day. It's not his fault. Okay. - Are you going upstairs? - Yes, Aunt. Hold on. I'm giving you milk. - Take a glass of milk. - Okay. Take this. - Give me. - Make sure he drinks it, okay? If he doesn't drink it, I will. I'll make him drink it. Oh, my God! What's wrong? Is Chamkila on leave? 'I'm yearning to get a glimpse of you.' 'Where are you? You seem like a dream.' 'I yearn to meet you.' You haven't eat, aunt has been troubling me. Here, drink milk. To heck with the milk. - Laddu. - Yes. If you can get me a few things written in the book.. ..I can attain her. I just read the book. Leave my hand. You'll get me into trouble. What have you gotten into? Have you ever felt like you see someone all the time? While bathing, while sleeping, while eating? Tell me. It happens with me all the time. It happened a bit too much last week. The policeman's daughter-in-law. Since I've seen her.. ..I can't seem to get her out of my head. While I read, while I write, while I'm in bed.. ..I see her everywhere. The same thing is happening with me. The policeman's daughter-in-law? Get lost, you idiot! - I'll tell aunt. - Get lost! Idiot! You talk rubbish all the time! I'll tell aunt. She'll teach you a lesson. Yes, Jeet. What are you looking for? Who else? My brother is missing. I wonder where he is. He's not even taking my calls. - He must be sleeping. - No. He's gone out. But he's been upset since a few days. He doesn't even eat properly. He doesn't talk to anyone. He stays alone. - I just don't understand. - Really? So it has come this far. What do you mean? What are you talking about? Tell me clearly. What is it? Aunt, he's a young man. He wants to get married. Once his wife comes home, he'll be absolutely fine. But he doesn't even like any girl. He's just like his father. Like? He already likes someone. What? Really? Who is she? She came to our house for the wedding. - Roop. - I see. Yes, she's beautiful. She's unmarried too. She's the one. And Aunt, she's a relative of mom. That's even better. I'll talk to Mindo. You sit. All right, then, it's done. I'll call brother. What could be better than this? She doesn't have a father. My brother Jogi has taken their responsibility. They won't refuse. She's her only daughter. I'll talk to them. Don't worry. So, should I take it as a yes? But there's something, sister-in-law. What? To make a dress for me, you'll require extra material. Look at you! You scared me! In fact, you should get dresses made for everyone. He's like a son to you too. I will make for the others, but you make it for me. I'll make you two, not one. Be seated. I'll get some sweets. Yes. I've told you everything. They've asked for this alliance. They have a good name in the village. I shouldn't force you. The decision rests on you. This is great news. Anyway, after Roop's father's demise.. ..your wife and you have supported us. Moreover, you'll always think in Roop's best interest. This is in Roop's best interest. My sister lives there. They are in affluent family. Your daughter will live in luxury. - Just get me some sweets. - Sure. Here. - No. Just a little bit.. - Please. - Take the whole thing. - No. Congratulations. I don't understand. We have so many farmers and labourers. Why do you still drive the tractor on your own? - Luxury cars can't give you.. - Yes. - ..the pleasure that this tractor can. - Really? Well, I have another doubt. - Your alliance has been fixed. - Yes. You'll soon get married. Your ex-girlfriends will be very upset. I was just saying.. Friends like you make sure to ruin their friends. Listen to me, you diehard fan of Sunny Leone. I beg of you. It's a request. Don't get me divorced before my marriage. I won't let you be ruined. Give me all the numbers. I'll handle all the other girls. I'll work hard to make sure no one gets upset. We have to plough this land before we go home. If we don't, dad will thrash me. You know that, don't you? This isn't a big deal. I used to plough huge acres of land in a day. - Really? - Yes. Which tractor was it? The old tractor we had. You boast so much! At least add some logic to your statements. It's no use anyway. - Believe it if you want to. - The rest is up to you. That's up to you. Well, you boast really well. - I won't talk to you. - How are you? - How's it going? - How are you? - Come. - Coming. - Come. - Let's go. - You agreed on the tractor, didn't you? - I did. Come. - Coming. - So, how are you back so early from college? I'm back, but what's going on with you? Aunt said you've found a girl. Not yet. We haven't spoken since that day. Just the alliance has been fixed. - Why? - I can't even follow her now. If I had her number, I'd have talked to her. - Well, I have something for you. - What? I got her number. - You're lying. - I swear. That's not a big deal. You could have asked me. I have numbers of many girls. Hey, I'm talking about Roop. You're the best brother in the world. He's an idiot. He doesn't know what he's saying. Give me the number. Check your Whatsapp. Talk here. You'd make me turn on the speaker. How can I talk in front of you two? Nonsense! Idiot! There's a network tower here. Get lost. Stop it! Move away! You idiot! - It's ringing. - Okay. Hello. - Hello. - Yes, who is it? - It's me. - Who? - It's me, Jassi. - Oh, God! What happened, dear? Please talk. Give me. Hello. Who is it? - It's me.. Okay. - What? He hung up. Her mother is with her. How will she talk? What's the matter? What kind of a girl is she! She gave the phone to her mother. What? Her mother answered. How will she talk? She's petrified. 'Okay, I'm Jassi!' Don't try to threaten her. Of course. Forget him. Give me the phone. You've saved her name as your wife. - All right, then. - Call her. Hello. Who is it? Greetings, ma'am. This is Jeet, Jasjeet's younger brother. Greetings, dear. Bless you. Yes, what's the matter? Why did you call? Well, can I please talk to Roop? Actually, brother wants to talk. Okay. So, why didn't he call? Well, brother feels shy. Can he talk to her? Okay. Talk to him, dear. No, Mom, I don't want to. Dear, just as your brother feels shy.. ..she feels shy too. Really? Okay, then. Goodbye. Okay, dear. Bless you. Silly. - What did she say? - What else? She's just like you. - He's useless. - You rascal! Oh, no.. Mom, are you asleep? No, dear, I'm walking in the fields. Just go to sleep. "I was with my beloved at night." "We got so late.. ..I didn't realize it." So, are you going to meet her? I've somehow managed to convince her. She was very nervous. As if I'm going to kill her. Look at your personality. She's bound to be scared. Okay, stop it. I'll see you in the evening. - Do your work. - Drop me too. Excuse me. Where? Don't try to tag along. I'll see you in the evening. Get out. - Fine, Brother. - Go. You've forgotten your brother. - Never mind. - Okay, then. We won't be spared. Come on. We're done for. - Greetings. - Greetings. Where are you headed? That.. You won't be able to drive the tractor all decked up. Tractor? To spread the fertilisers. I told you yesterday. Fertilisers need to be spread on the potatoes. Let's go. We have so many labourers, uncle. They'll do it. Why does brother have to go? - Right, Brother? - Yes. We may have a hundred labourers, dear. But they won't be able to do it the way you do. Hurry up now, and take him along. But Dad, I was going to college. College? It's been years since you completed your education. What are you going there for? - Well, it's his convocation day. - Yes. He'll get his degree. Yes, Dad. We'll wear black coats and take our degrees. Oh, that! You're supposed to fling your hats! Yes. Sir, please let me go with him. I'll click his pictures when he flings his hat. What's the point of the event when there are no pictures? - Just let me go with him. - Shut up. What will you do in college? You have nothing to do there. Please tell him to take me. I might find someone there. What will I do with those pictures? - Save me. - Tell me. Who's going to spread the fertilisers? Uncle, why do you worry? Laddu and I are here. Right, Laddu? Will Laddu and you do it? You're wearing pants too. How will you do it? - I'll change and be back. - Okay, then. Take Laddu along. - Jassi! - Yes, Dad. - Come home soon. - Okay, Dad. - Go on! - Stop it! I'll see you in the evening. You come with me. I'll quench your thirst. - Come on. - Let's go. Get going. I'm sorry, I'm late. Dad stopped me. It was very difficult for me to come. - Did you come by bus? - What? No, by car. Why? No. You said it was difficult for you to come. I thought, maybe you didn't get a seat in the bus. My pass doesn't work here, so.. Is everything okay at home? Yes, everyone is fine. Mom is fine. Namo is fine too. Lachi was a bit weak, but she's okay now. Are Namo and Lachi your friends? No, Namo is our cow, and Lachi is its calf. Oh! What would you like, sir? - I'll have a cappuccino. - Okay, sir. What about you? I'll have a vodka. No, two vodkas. I-I'll be right back. Ma'am, don't be angry.. ..but you don't look like you drink vodka. I drink it every day. The children in my house drink it. My mom gives me one right after I wake up. Jeet. I'm done for. Roop is an alcoholic. Ma'am, do you even know what vodka is? Yes, it's a form of coffee. The rich drink it. No, ma'am. Vodka is alcohol. - What? - Yes. Oh, God! That witch! She'll rot in hell. I won't spare her. What will he think of me? What do I do now? Couldn't you have told me this before? Oh, God! I'll talk to you later. - Did you say something? - No. I didn't say anything. - Get two cups of coffee. - Okay. Is coffee okay for you? Well, I didn't know what to order. So, my friend said I should order vodka. I didn't know vodka was alcohol. - Sir, your bill. - Give it. How much is the bill? Why? Will you pay? No, but we'll split. Excuse me. We're going to get married. But we aren't married yet. - How much is the bill? - Rs. 430. This is all I have. I'll pay you the rest tomorrow. Why? Are we meeting again tomorrow? "The lake is full.." Who the heck are you! - Move it away. - Hold on a minute. Why the heck are you in such a hurry? - Mind your language. - You seem egoistic. If I slap you hard, you'll come to your senses. I know you. But I'm no less. - You! - Hey, you! You're trying to act too smart, aren't you? You don't know me! Hey, you! - Get lost! - I am saying you, don't touch me! - Get lost! - I'll show you! - Hey, you! - Listen to me! - Nonsense! - Hey, listen to me! People like you.. ..are under my shoe. Sir.. "Your friend speaks up.." Tell your mother to birth a son who's strong enough to stand in my way. "Your friend speaks up." "Your friend speaks up." - Greetings. - Greetings, sir. What brings you here early in the morning? You should have called me. I'd have come. It's okay, sir. We didn't want to bother you. So, we came on our own. Tell me, what's the matter? Sir, my servant Heera was bringing some stuff on his cart at night. His cart was stuck on the road. And a responsible resident of our village misbehaved with him. Sir, he was only trying to move his cart. - Since it was heavy, he couldn't do it. - Right. He was helpless. For this reason, that drunkard abused him and slapped him. He took this incident to heart. He wants to die. We stopped him. You have to take a call on this. You don't even tolerate someone abusing, sir. But he abused him physically. Tell me, what's to be done? The law is the same for everyone. I will not let injustice happen with anyone. Tell me, who is it? We'll call him. Ask him if he's strong enough to hear his name. Listen. Tell your younger brother to stay in his limits. No, all he was saying is.. ..he might change his decision after knowing the culprit. He might break the rules and laws. You know that our family has never gone back on its word. We never change our rules and laws for anyone. So, listen, sir, the culprit is your younger brother. Shamsher Singh. We'll call him and ask him to apologise. Sir, he will have to apologise in the council. Not at home. - Moreover, this is the council's matter now. - Yes, he is right. I never change my laws for anyone. Even if the culprit is my brother. The law was the same for your brother and mine. I don't understand why you refuse to believe me. It wasn't my fault. I was on my way, like always. It's a government road. He was in my way. I asked him politely to move. But he answered me back. And I can't tolerate anyone answering me back. - Who the heck is he? - I see. Are you trying to say he's not human? This is our village, and everyone is equal here. Whether rich or poor. Everyone is equal. You tell me, sir. What should be done? You all know that the village head does not even approve of.. ..anyone abusing. But he abused and slapped. Let's see what the village head has to say now. Heera, you tell me. What do you want? What else? Heera wants an apology from him.. ..so that he gets his lost honour back. Don't worry, Heera. Justice will be delivered. Tell me, what you want. I didn't want to come to the council. But I came because the elders insisted. Or else, the decision would have been made by now. Heera, you tell me. What do you want? Apology. I won't apologise. He made a mistake, and he got slapped. If he speaks ill again, I'll slap him again. You'll have to apologise, Shera. Yes. Accepting your mistake is a big thing. And the one who apologises becomes the bigger person. So.. Apologise to Heera. I'm sorry. What did he say? I didn't hear. What did you say? Apologise loudly, with a clear heart. Tell him, sir. Forgive me. Are you happy now, Heera? I told you that the village head never violates the law.. ..even when the culprit is his own brother. Let's go now. Get back to work. It was my fault? He thinks it was my fault? He asked me to apologise in front of everyone. It was never my fault. He had to show off, after all. I know my brother. Don't try to act too smart. Shut up. Since I've come to this house I have been quiet. But how will you shut the people up? How many people will you shut up? Didn't you hear what I said? Shut up and mind your own business. I am minding my own business. But you never did what you should have. We've been serving your brother all our lives. He showed his true colours after all. He boasted about loving his brother. If he loved his brother, why did he make you apologise? He was the council head. He could do what he wanted. Listen, I've told you umpteen times not to talk nonsense to me. Even a member of the council would save his family. And he's the village head. Couldn't he have pardoned the mistake of his younger brother? Humans make mistakes, but no. He embarrassed you in front of the council. He could have taken a call at home. We wouldn't have lost face in front of the others. But no! He's the village head, after all. Trying to be an honest man! What are you thinking now? Where's Jeet? Must be serving them. You serve your brother, and he serves his son. Laddu, the day you marry, everyone will be stunned. I don't think he's capable of that. - Relax, boy. - Throw a card. - Go on. - Come on. Laddu, you will lose. Try all you want. You're going to get married. What's he going to do? Let him keep the queen. Come on! I won't get the queen in real life. Let me keep this one at least. Make your move. - Here you go. - At least make a move. Come on. - Uncle is here. - He's here. - Come. - Come. Distribute for him too. Do we educate you so you can gamble here? What's the matter? What do you care? No matter what happens, all you want to do is have fun. Don't be angry, uncle. He came with me. - Yes. I brought him. - Shut up! I know you pretty well. If I see you playing cards again, you'll see the worst of me. Until you tell me what's wrong.. - ..I will sit right here. - Don't speak. - Tell me, what's my fault? - Quiet. - You want to know your fault? - No.. - You want to know your fault? - Uncle.. You slapped brother, Dad? It's okay, never mind. He's my uncle. He's raised us. Go, take uncle home. But how could he slap? He's drunk. Never mind. Go. Let's go. I won't spare you. Let's go. I.. Well.. Sito, you're trying to say something, but you aren't. Tell me what the matter is. I was wondering whether or not to tell you what I saw. Look, this is your family matter. You should sort it out. Our family matter? We should sort it out? Be clear. What are you trying to say? Where do I start? Your brother-in-law slapped your son publically. He was angry about what happened at the council. He couldn't blame his elder brother for it. So, he vented his anger on the younger ones. Sherry slapped my son? Publically? Yes, your son was sulking. His face turned red. Okay, then, Kanta and Banta must be waiting. They must be hungry. I'll make a move. Okay, bye. What's the matter? You look angry. You didn't even greet me. I'm bound to be angry. When your brother made a mistake.. ..you made him apologise in front of the council. But that doesn't mean he can slap my son publically. So what? He's his uncle. He has the authority. Listen, my son matters to me the most. What if he had retaliated? Or what if he had harmed himself? What would we have done? You have to talk to your brother. Or else.. I can't seem to forget that scene. How could he humiliate.. ..his younger brother in front of the village! He thinks he's the most honest person on earth. Are you listening? Turn around. It pierced you today.. ..but I've been living with it all my life. I never said anything. I was suffering all these years as I respect your elder brother. But think about it. What do we have? They have everything. A big tractor, cars, jeeps, all the wealth is possessed by them. We only get what's left, to spend. You're sleeping soundly. I've lost my slumber. Listen, it's late at night. Just go to sleep. Stop blabbering. I have to go to work in the morning. Gogi and his family is better than us. At least they don't have to beg before anyone. Until we beg, we don't get anything. We don't even have an honourable life. 'We have nothing left.' 'How could he humiliate..' '..his younger brother in front of the village!' 'Gogi and his family is better than us.' 'At least they don't have to beg before anyone.' 'How could he humiliate.. 'Gogi and his family is better than us.' 'How could he humiliate.. ..his younger brother in front of the village!' 'At least they don't have to beg before anyone.' What's this, Dad? You were angry yesterday. And you've started drinking early in the morning today. If something's bothering you, at least tell me. What's bothering me? Nothing at all. I'm not angry. What would I be angry about? If there was something, I'd have told you. It's nothing. I have to go to the farm. Take my lunch from your mom and bring it later on. You're all set to go and serve them again. You'll continue to work, and they'll continue to take advantage. They'll make you and us serve them forever. This is what they want. What should I say? - Gogi. - Yes. Water the fields properly. Okay, I'll do it. No need, you idiot. Get lost. I'll leave. Don't do it. There's no need to water the fields. Let me work. This isn't the time to joke. Am I joke? You're the one who joked, Brother. What do you mean? You could have suppressed the matter if you wanted. You made a mistake, that's why you apologised. If you make mistakes, you have to pay for them. I've been screaming since yesterday and telling you.. ..it was not my fault. But you never listened. You're too arrogant. What are you trying to say? There's nothing left to say. If you weren't my elder brother.. ..I would have taught you a lesson. Mind your tongue, Brother, or I'll have to punish you. You'll punish me? Will you! Go, let me know. Go on. Leave me. Leave me. Uncle! Uncle! Dad! Stop! - You don't know me! - Hey! There's been a disaster! Your brother-in-law is hitting your husband in the fields. My son called me and told me the father and son are attacking him! - Dear Lord! - Yes! See, I told you! Come on! - Take me! - I'll handle it, Mom. You stay here! - What's happening with us! - I know! What are we going to do now! Go and see what's happening! Yes, Brother, they've left. As far as the house is concerned.. ..I've made two separate ones for the two of you. You two have separate tractors and farm machinery as well. But I did not divide the mansion. If I had, then there wouldn't be any unity. But if the situations are such that a division is necessary.. ..then we have the village head right here. Let there be a council meeting, and divide it. We don't abide by the village head. Just let me know who's going to give me food. Or else.. We will serve you food. We are capable enough. I know how capable you are. I know you. I know you pretty well too. Listen, make sure there are witnesses during the division. The village head isn't trustworthy. He might not do it equally. When the women start to speak, the men have nothing to do. Let me know your decision. Perhaps, God made me build the old age home for this day. Maybe I will go there myself. Here. Tell me how it tastes. I'll finish it off today. Why have you brought three? Well, I thought the three of us will sit together. I'm not a child. Why are you so upset? Don't pretend, Laddu. What if this had happened with Uncle Gogi? You think this could ever happen? And Jassi loves you and your dad a lot. - Don't try to defend him. - He's not defending me. He's telling the truth. Try and understand, dear. Yes, everyone's right here. I'm the one who's wrong. Or my father. Listen, don't take him seriously. You know he can't live without you. Don't worry. Everything will be fine. I don't know.. ..if everything will be fine now. Everything's messed up. - Never mind. Let's go. - Let's sit for some time. Roop, I'm going to the market, okay? 'The number you have called is unavailable.' - Hi, Roop. Greetings. - What's wrong with you? - Nothing. - Then why do you sound low? Did someone say something to you? No, no one said anything to me. Yes, no one can dare say anything to you when your brother is there. Listen, did your brother scold you? Tell me. Okay, consider me your sister and share it with me. You're like a brother to me, aren't you? I'll set your brother straight. It's nothing, Roop. You tell me. Why did you call? Is it important? Yes, I tried calling your brother. He didn't answer. I thought you must be with him. So I called you. Roop, I'll call you later. Mom is calling me. We'll talk later. Okay, bye. He hung up. I know everything, Laddu. What should I tell Roop about why I'm not talking to her? I'm not in the mood to.. I'll call you back. Dad, stop over-thinking. The land has been divided, our hearts haven't. You're worrying for no reason. Dad, I'm going to be like you too. Whenever there is an issue at the council, I'll go with you. We'll resolve issues together. And later on, I can become a member of the council. Jassi, come early to the farm tomorrow morning. Your uncle won't be coming. Watch out. Greetings, young Sardar! Why do you say that? He owns a separate land now. He's the sole owner. Call him sir! - I'm sorry, sir. - Sit down. I'm glad you apologised. Apologising makes you the bigger person. Move out of his way. Please go. - So, was that fun? - Absolutely! I'm very happy! I'm not happy yet. I'll be happy when their sons split too. They are still connected somehow. Never mind, let's go. Friends, as you all know, there's going to be.. ..a tractor race once again. From all the surrounding villages.. ..young men have reached the ground with their tractors. And the former champions of this race.. ..Jassi and Jeet and ready with their tractors too. So, let's watch if this Jaddi Sardar pair.. ..can repeat history or not. Let the competition begin. The race has begun. So, friends, victory doesn't remain with one. I have witness history changing.. ..and it has changed yet again. The young men who have won the race.. ..have recreated history. Their names are Kant and Bant. I request the chief guests to honour the winners. A huge round of applause, boys! Well done! Wonderful! We witnessed a pair winning before. We witnessed another pair winning this time. No one can survive alone. They are two brothers in one soul. Greetings! Yes, tell me? It's been long. I thought we should fix the wedding date. What wedding? Why are you joking? Jasjeet and Roop's wedding. Stay right here. Okay. She must have gone to get oil. She'll drop the oil first and welcome us. It's auspicious. Here are your gifts. We have nothing to do with you. What's this? If something's wrong, we can sort it out. I don't want to talk to you. Your sister lives next door. Go and talk to her. Understand? But.. Oh, yes. Yes. I saw it. Yes. Brother? I'll call you later. Greetings! I'm so happy, my brother is here! Hey, bring water. Not water, bring buttermilk for my brother. I will drink buttermilk and eat food too. First tell me, if there was a tiff between the brothers.. ..was it not your duty to inform me! They threw the gifts on my face! They've broken all ties with us. We don't visit them, and they don't visit us. Your ties are broken, and I'm being punished for it. What will I tell that family? Especially that kind lady.. ..whose daughter I promised to marry off on your word. What would I tell you, Brother? There was nothing left to say. They broke all ties with us. Listen, Sister, I don't care. If the alliance is called off, people will blame the girl. I need an answer, a solid one. What am I supposed to do? It's their fault. Don't do anything. All you do now is forget you have a brother. Why do you say that, Brother? Come in and have buttermilk. - I need an answer first. - I will tell you. - Come in first and have buttermilk. - The answer first. - Come in first and have buttermilk. - The answer. Okay, then. I'll do something. Listen, give him the buttermilk. Brother. I want the answer first. Come in and have buttermilk first. - The answer. - Okay, then, listen. You want to get her married, right? Forget their son. She'll marry our son. But the wedding should happen in the next 10 days. Do you agree? Come in now, Brother. Keep the fruits inside. - Mom. - Take these. - Yes. - Was uncle here? My son is back! Have some sweets first. Take. That's okay, but what's all this? And why was uncle here? To fix your alliance. We've done it. You fixed my alliance? Without asking me? We don't ask our kids before doing all this. If your parents can get you educated.. ..then they have the authority to get you married too. That's not what I meant, Mom. But you should have at least told me. Who's the girl? You know her, and you'll like her. But who is she? Roop. Are you out of your mind, Mom? She's going to marry brother. They love each other. You got this alliance fixed. I agree that we're not on talking terms.. ..but I can't stoop to this level. Roop calls me her brother. And I call her sister-in-law. - And you want me to marry her? - They are the one who agreed. - And I couldn't refuse my brother. - But this is wrong. I don't know all that, but I've said yes to this alliance.. ..and you must agree too, for your mother's sake. Mom, if you're stubborn, then I am your son. I will never agree to this alliance. No one will know unless someone sees it. Let me open the curtains. I am going to die! - I don't want to live! - Ma'am, open the door! Save me. I am going to die! Ma'am, open the door! Ma'am! Jeet! Jeet! Jeet! Jeet! Jeet! - Jeet! Jeet! Jeet! - Yes? Your mom has locked herself in the room! Come quick! - Hurry up, dear! Come on! - Come. I hope she's okay. Come on! Mom! Mom, open the door! Open the door! - Mom, open the door! - Ma'am, open the door. - Mom! - Please, open! - Mom! Open the door! - Ma'am, please open. - Open the door! - Open the door! When the son starts disrespting his mother.. ..a mother doesn't feel like living anymore. I don't want to live anymore. I want to die. Stop being childish, Mom. Open the door. - You can stick to your decision. - Mom tell me, what's the matter? - And I'll stick to mine. - Mom, please open the door. I don't want to live. Mom! Mom! Mom! - I don't want to live. - Mom! - Ma'am! - Mom! Mom! Stop being childish! Why are you doing this? What is it? Why are you doing this? Tell me what the matter is. I'll do as I please. I don't want to live anymore. My son doesn't listen to me. What do you want! Say yes to the alliance. You're asking me to kill myself. No. I want you to say yes to this alliance and get married. Make us happy. If it's about your stubbornness, then get me married. I agree. But don't ever ask me why I don't smile anymore. Bless you, my son. Hey, get me some sweets. I'll do it. I'll get you married in 10 days. - Greetings, Uncle. - Greetings. The matter is awkward. But I didn't want Roop to be accused.. ..of her alliance being called off. Roop is a wise girl. I am certain that she will understand. Okay, I'll make a move. Make arrangements for the wedding. They want to marry in the next 10 days. Dear Lord! Mom, what did uncle say? I'm sorry, but I overheard him saying.. ..they want to marry in the next 10 days. What's wrong? Why are you sad? Don't worry, you won't have to spend much. I'll stitch my own clothes, and we'll borrow the rest. Mom, you're my friend, aren't you? Tell me what it is. Is there a problem? - You are marrying into their family, but.. - Yes. I know, Jass is a Jaddi Sardar. Now you're getting married into the family.. ..of his younger brother. What do you mean? I don't understand. I mean, you won't marry Jagtar Singh's son, Jass. You'll marry Shamsher Singh's son, Jeet. What! Mom, how could you even think of that! I think of Jeet as my brother. I never looked at any boy all my life. I studied with my head down. So that your honour could remain intact. Jass means everything to me. I can't do this. I was helpless, dear. You know that after your father's demise, we were miserable. It was your uncle who supported us.. ..and helped complete your education. When it was about his word, I couldn't have backed out. Mom, can you ruin my life for the sake of uncle's word? Can you see your daughter unhappy for the rest of her life? But what's our fault in all this? Jassi and his family have cancelled this alliance. They threw the gifts at your uncle's face. Ms. Mindo saved our honour. You tell me, what's our fault? This is wrong. I won't marry him. 'The person you're calling is not..' Take this. It's your father's turban. Get rid of it.. ..and then, you can do as you please. If it's about dad's honour.. ..then I'm ready. "I'm helpless." - "I'm not disloyal." - Don't cry! "Don't reveal our secrets to anyone." "I cried a lot and compromised with the situation." "I won't be happy with the one my parents have chosen for me." "I won't be happy with the one my parents have chosen for me." Greetings, Mom. I never imagined this would happen with us. What's wrong, Mom? You look disturbed. What happened? I heard about lands being divided. But our relatives have crossed all limits. Along with the land.. ..they took your wife too. What are you talking about, Mom? Are you all right? I am all right, but when you'll learn the truth.. ..you'll be shocked. You adored your aunt, didn't you? She got your alliance called off.. ..and is getting her son married to her now. Yes. Aunt! Aunt! Aunt! Aunt! - Yes? - Aunt, is mom telling the truth? Why? Don't you believe your mother? Or do you want to hear it from me? All right, then, listen. Yes, I fixed my son's alliance over there. But you know that I asked for it first. We like each other. Mind your tongue! She's going to be my daughter-in-law. And I won't tolerate anyone talking like that about her! Don't you dare even think about her again! I'll kill you! Try touching my son if you have the guts. You'll see what I can do. Mom, what are you saying? First, you insult people, and then come to talk to them! Shameless people! Get lost now! - Take him along! - Aunt.. Dear Lord, bless me. Dear Lord! - Greetings, sir. - Greetings, sir. Why are you quiet, sir? Staying quiet won't benefit anyone. You'll be at a loss instead. Things will escalate. The brothers fought first, then there was the division.. ..and now the marriage? Am I right, sir? Gogi, if things were in my control, I would have handled it already. I'm only waiting for the moment where both my sons.. ..will unite before I die. Don't say that, sir. Sir, you're the eldest. - Who can deny you? - Yes. At least try talking to them. Gogi, when a person gets selfish.. ..they can only be taught a lesson by time. Only time will tell what happens. Sir, I'm just afraid.. .. that it might be too late and things might get out of control. Silly, they are my sons, after all. They are bound to be hot-headed. As they say, one never forgets his roots. Just pray to God. - Dear Lord, have mercy. - Dear Lord. Here, drink milk, Jassi. No, Mom, I don't feel like it. Drink it, dear. Look at you. You didn't sleep all night. You went somewhere early in the morning. And now you're doing this. Drink it, dear. This is too much. Boys are unpredictable. They do what they feel like, don't even eat. - Give it to me. I'll try. - Okay. - Jassi. Hey, Jassi. - Yes. Why are you doing it on your own, dear? You should have called someone. Or we would have got it washed elsewhere. They must be busy, Dad. Anyway, I had nothing to do. Okay, then, drink milk. No, Dad, I don't feel like it. Jassi, dear, I can't see you upset. No, Dad, you're misunderstanding. You think such things can affect me? Jassi, I'm your father. When the child is upset, the parents suffer the most. And you look very upset. Take my advice. Go live with your uncle. You'll forget the past. Don't do this, Dad. - I can at least see.. - I don't want you to see things here. For the last time, dear, go to your uncle. Consider this my order. If it's your order, Dad, then I accept it. Bless you. Land acquired. Sports makes money. Well, I must say. Sports is addictive. - Greetings. - Greetings. Congratulations on your son's wedding, sir! Congratulations to you too. Everything happened in haste. There's going to be a wedding in your family after very long. The village head will be ecstatic. You're too much. They are separated now. Why would the village head attend the wedding? Right? Well, brother will come. He will definitely come. Well, you know that such tiffs are common. Families don't fall apart over such differences. Look at what's happening in the village. Our dear ones are our own. Make sure he doesn't miss his flight. Come on time. Okay? Bye. So.. - Have you packed? - Yes, Dad, I have. Dear, keep this. This contains 'Pinnis'. Have some and give the rest to your uncle. Okay, Mom. - "Mango chutney.. - We don't want it." - "It's delicious. - We don't want it." - "Mango chutney.. - We don't want it." - "Have it. - We don't want it." Go and stop him. Do something. He's my son. - "Mango chutney.. - We don't want it." - "It's delicious. - We don't want it." - "Mango chutney.. - We don't want it." - "It's delicious. - We don't want it." - "Mango chutney.. - We don't want it." - "It's delicious. - We don't want it." - "Have it. - We don't want it." - "Taste it. - We don't want it." - "Taste it. - We don't want it." - "It's delicious. - We don't want it." - "Taste it. - We don't want it." - "It's delicious. - We don't want it." - "Mango chutney.. - We don't want it." - "It's delicious. - We don't want it." - "Have it. - We don't want it." - "Have it. - We don't want it." - "Have it. - We don't want it." - "It's delicious. - We don't want it." Let's go. What has happened? 'Brother, when you get married, I'll fire bullets in the air.' 'We'll burst many more firecrackers than these.' 'The villagers should know that it's Jassi's brother's wedding.' 'It's a big deal.' He has started firing bullets! Get up! Do you want to see us get killed? Dear Lord! He's still a servant of theirs! He's still in agony! I'll have to do something. I'll get a gun and show him. 'My brother's word means the most to me.' 'I swear, Brother.' 'I want you as my brother for all my lives.' 'You're the best brother in the world.' I'll teach them a lesson. Wait and watch. How dare they! Here, take this! It's okay, Mom. Let them do what they want. So, how's the atmosphere in the house? She was going to marry Jassi, now she's marrying Jeet. She'll get a taste of both of them! Well, both the brothers are miserable. They don't belong anywhere now. They've lost face in the village and their homes. Well, it's now that we've truly taken our revenge. We've taught a lesson to our enemies. Idiots! A revenge completes not when you teach a lesson.. ..but when you finish off the enemy. Call him. Listen to me. I asked you to get utensils. Why do you mess things up? You don't get it? I'll explain to you later. Listen.. What! You won't get it? All right, then, don't ask for work again. Go to hell! Goodbye! Hey, Laddu, you aren't ready yet? I mean, why aren't you ready? Weddings these days are weird. They want to have royal weddings. I don't feel happy, so I won't go, Dad. - I'm not coming. - What did you say? Hey! We've been loyal to them all our lives! What will people say if we don't participate in their happiness? You're not going to the wedding even when they've invited us. They told you to drop Jassi to the airport and you didn't go. What do you want to do? Dad, we were three friends, not two. If I side with one, the other will feel bad. So I'm not going anywhere. Your sister didn't come either. Everyone must be waiting. - I've told her not to come. - Why? I told her I'll forget her if she attends the wedding. She'll be at a loss. You can go, Dad. We won't go. Fine! It's up to you! Do what you want! I'm going to the wedding procession. Go to the fields and do some work then. We don't want to starve. Understand? - Dad. - Yes. Which field do I have to go to? The field has been divided. The cattle might have a dispute. Greetings, Grandpa. Bless you. This is Jeet's share of the offerings. Give it to him. - Take care, dear. - Yes. Don't forget your old grandfather. Jassi. "I've been shattered numurous times." "I was punished for being in love." "I am not at peace now." "Who should I share my agony with?" "There's something else in my heart. I've lost my mind." "Why did you change so soon?" "Why did you change so soon?" "Those who I loved at some point.. ..have come to kill me now." "Those who I loved at some point.." "..have come to kill me now." How much do you want, girls? We want 5100 from him. Right. 'Listen, dear, when my younger son gets married..' '..no matter how much money his sisters-in-law demand..' '..I wil give them 21,000.' 'People should know that Jaddi Sardar's son is getting married.' 'Right?' Here you go. 21,000.' "I never thought that a day like this would come." "When suddenly, from being happy, we'd be sad." "I never thought that a day like this would come." "When suddenly, from being happy, we'd be sad." "What's happened! As if everything's over." "I'm distressed." "I'm distressed." "Those who I loved at some point.." "..have come to kill me now." "Those who I loved at some point.." "..have come to kill me now." "I prayed to have them.." "..but I couldn't have them." "I prayed to have them.." "..but I couldn't have them." "We're about to do something crazy." "Our dear ones turned away from us." "Our dear ones turned away from us." "Those who I loved at some point.." "..have come to kill me now." "Those who I loved at some point.." "..have come to kill me now." Are you happy now? You didn't listen to me, did you? I told you not to do it against Jeet's will. You didn't listen. He's gone now. I didn't know Jeet would do this. If something was the matter, you should have told me. I would have endured the humiliation.. ..of the alliance being called off. The groom running away from the wedding is even worse. You too pressurised me, Brother. I was helpless. I couldn't have lost my brother. You should have. We would at least have our son. Sir, don't worry. Jeet has gone to the hospital. Listen, we've called the men. The wedding is happening there. - What's next? - Yes. You two are idiots. Don't you know what happens when the men get drunk at weddings? Idiots. Don't they act stupid? Do you remember that incident? The dancer almost got shot. The same can happen today. - Laddu! Laddu! - Yes, Papa. - Calling Jassi? - Yes, Papa. Get in. Stop the car. Stop. Come on. No, Jassi, don't shoot him. Please don't shoot him. Please, for your brother's sake, don't kill my brother. You have a brother too. Don't shoot him. Don't shoot him. You idiot! Why were you carrying a gun? Please don't kill him. He's like a brother to you. Don't kill him. You! Please spare him. Please, don't shoot. Please. Please, don't shoot. Let's go, come on! You should have shot at his head. The patient has lost a lot of blood. - His blood group is O negative. - Yes. We need blood right now. O negative is not available in our blood bank. Please arrange for it somehow. We need to transfuse it urgently. Father-in-law! Wise men. You did divide the land. But you couldn't divide the blood of your sons. We made a huge mistake. Please forgive us, Father-in-law. We made a mistake. The patient is out of danger. You can meet him if you want. - Thank God. - Come. Father-in-law, please forgive us. Anyway, we have realised our mistake. So, what would you call yourself? Well, an idiot. - Brother. - What? I'm an idiot too. Greetings! Son-in-law! - Tell me. - Come on. - What happened? - Come. - Greetings. - Greetings. - Come, ma'am. - Yes. Come. Come, dear. - We'll sit out. - Come. Jassi, look who's here. "Beautiful girl." "I won't leave your side." "You're mine, and I'll be yours." "You own my heart and soul." "I won't love anyone other than you." "Beautiful girl." "I won't leave your side." "You're mine, and I'll be yours." "Beautiful girl." Why are you so worried, Jeet? You're going to be a father. I'm not worried, I'm just excited. Be happy. Oh, my.. All right, I have the baby, and he belongs to his aunt. - Let me at least see him, sister-in-law. - Look! Isn't he beautiful? Who is he? Who is he? - Who is he? - Brother. Brother.
