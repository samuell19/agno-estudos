So, how'd I do? Better, right? Actually, you're two seconds slower than your top speed, which, as I've told you before, subpar. That can't be. I've been practicing day and night. - Let me try again. - Sabrina. I've hesitated saying this for a long time, but... you just don't have what it takes to compete in the Summer Games. Coach, this is my whole purpose in life. I have to be the best. I have to be. Please, give me another chance. I've given you more chances than anyone I've coached. I'm sorry, I really am. I have what it takes. And you know it. You've always known it. Sabrina, don't do that. Come on. Sabrina. We've gone over this before. I'm married. And even if I wasn't married, I'm too old for you. No, you're not. You're perfect for me. I think you need to go. Coach, please, I love you. You know how much I love you. I have always loved you. Coach, please, don't go. Sabrina! You need professional help. Where are you going? Sabrina? - Where are you going? - Work. Good. Doing what? Teaching brats to swim, okay? You satisfied? Yes. And you should be too. It's great you're finally doing something... Great? It's an insult. I trained my entire life for the big leagues, and now I'm just a... Well, we both know why you lost your shot at the big leagues. Don't we? Mom, I'm not in the mood. Mr. Scott? Hi, I'm... Sabrina Jameson. Swim instructor, right? I guess the inflatables gave me away. Yeah. Let me wash up. Come on in and meet my daughter, Ashley. Sabrina, call me Parker. Parker... What would you like to drink? Oh, water's fine. You'd think since I swim in it I'd hate the stuff, but no. Great. I'll be right back. Be right there. Hey, you must be Ashley. Catch a glimpse of the princess? I did, she's really pretty. Totally takes after her mom. Anyways. My wife, Ellen, had this beautiful pool built. Because she thought it would be great for family time. Absolutely. Yeah, and then there was an incident and now Ashley's afraid of the water. What happened? Um... It's okay if you don't want to tell me, but it might help me to figure out how to reach her. Have you tried to teach Ashley to swim yourself? Yeah. I can't even get her near the water. And, um... how 'bout your wife? Did she try? Yeah, about that. My wife, Ellen, um... She's away for a while. Oh. Where is she? Uh, she's with family. The job just started to wear me down. Pretty soon, I was... drinking to face trial dates. And then the worst day of all. I had told my 10-year-old daughter that I'd give her a swimming lesson. But I was drunk and I passed out. Ashley decided she could swim anyway. I'm lucky my husband was home that day. I don't know what would have happened if he wasn't there. A mother is supposed to protect her baby. My name is Ellen Scott. And I'm an alcoholic. Ashley, sweetheart? One second. Ash, I know you're in there and I know you can hear me. I asked this nice young lady, Sabrina, to maybe give you some swim lessons. What do you say? Let me try. Hey, Ashley. I'm Sabrina. You know, I was just like you at your age. You couldn't get me near a pool. But then... one day this great swimming teacher helped me get over my fears and now... And now... Sabrina is training for the Summer Games. The Summer Games? The real Summer Games? That's right. And if you wanted, maybe one day you could be on the national team too. But we're never gonna know unless you get in the water. 'Kay. All right then. Go on and get into your swimsuit and I'll meet you outside. All right. I'm gonna sit right over there at that patio table. And... Do my... work, but I'll keep an eye on you the whole time, okay? All right. Now. First thing we're gonna do is touch the water. See? The other teachers tried that same trick and it didn't work. Well, let's try stepping into the pool together. I'll hold your hand the whole time. Here, let's try something different. May I? Come here. Good job. There we go. Okay. This is gonna take a whole lot of courage, but I know you can do it, okay? Watch me first and then you try. All right, you watching? You ready? All right, come on. It's not bad, I promise. Come on. All right, you ready? One, two, three. All right, now splash me, come on. No, a real one! Splash me, come on. Come on. You're doing it again. What? What am I doing? You're obsessing over some older man. Who is he this time? Oh, wait, I know. The father of the "brat" you had to teach. So? He's married, right? That is none of your business. Oh, the hell it isn't. I said that you could live here as long as you promised to never do this again. But, Mom, this one is perfect for me. He's... He's perfect. Oh, Sabrina. Your father left you. And you going after these older men isn't going to bring him home. Yeah, and you know why Dad walked out? Because of you. You drove him out, and I miss him every single day. Miss him all you want. He's never coming back. And if you think you're gonna find him in these other men, - you're dead wrong. - Parker is different. His marriage is in trouble. He needs me. Okay, I'm gonna call Dr. Gonzalez. What? No. He'll make me take those pills again. Yeah, you need to take those pills again. I don't need any damn pills. Stop. Give it. Fine. You don't want to get help? Then you gotta call this Parker and tell him that you're gonna turn down the job. I can't do that. I love him. He's... he's the one. What are you doing? I said what are you doing? I'm calling your client and telling him you are unwell. Mom. Please don't ruin this for me, please, I am begging you. This is for your own good, Sabrina, and you know it. You've gotta be kidding me. Knock it off. This is Parker. Hello? Hello? This is Park... I said not to call him. I told you don't call. What is the matter with you? Get up. Mom? Mom? Mom? All right. Snack time. Here we go. One for you. Is this what you drink when you're in the pros? Yep. Dad, can Sabrina stay for dinner? Ashley, I'm sure she has other plans, not to mention other students. I could rearrange my schedule. Oh, you don't have to do that. Please, Dad? You can make your famous pasta. Famous pasta, huh? Sounds great. And, fortunately, I was working from home that day and just happened to check on Ashley's progress. I mean, had I shown up a minute later... Oh my God, no. Yeah. So, that's why Ashley's afraid of the water, and that's when Ellen and I decided she needed to go to rehab. Sorry, I didn't feel comfortable telling you sooner, - so I wasn't... - No, no, it's okay. Can I tell you something else? Of course. Ashley is the center of my life. I haven't seen her this happy in months. It's all because of you. Come on, I'm just givin' her swim lessons. No, I'm serious. It's in the care and the concern that you show for her. I mean, you treat her like she's your own. I can't tell you how much that means to me. Whoa, uh, I'm still married. Oh my God, I... I'm so sorry. Forgive me. Look, I...I would be lying if I was to tell you that I'm not extremely attracted to you. But I'm still deeply committed to my wife Ellen. Of course you are. I...I just got swept up in the moment. I guess I did too. Ah, so, um... See you tomorrow afternoon. I'll be here. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Hey, babe. Hi, honey. Um, listen, I know it's a little late, but... No, no, no, no, it's okay. The doctor finally said I'm ready to come home. That's great. He says I can leave tomorrow. I'll be there first thing to pick you up. Thank you. And how's my baby? She's doing great. I finally found her a swim instructor. Sabrina. And she's training for the Summer Games. Ash loves her. She's like a little dolphin, I can hardly keep her out of the pool. What's the matter? I wasn't there for her first lesson. Don't worry. There'll be plenty more to come. See you in the morning? Okay. I'll be waiting. I love you. Love you too. I'll need your phone back, please. Thank you. Fiji. How 'bout you, babe? Sabrina! Hey! Big surprise. - Come on, hurry! - Okay. Wow. - Okay, I'll be right back. - Okay. So, what's all this about a big surprise? Ellen's home. Oh. Yeah, it's a little unexpected, so I would appreciate it if we could be discreet about our moment the other night. Of course. Hey, I'm just here for Ashley, right? No worries. Oh, wait. You're gonna. Like, on day one we had a splash fight. So much fun. You're gonna be so proud of me. Sabrina! Nice to meet you. My name is Ellen. So happy to meet you. - I'm Sabrina. - I know! All I've been hearing since I've been back is, "Sabrina!" Thank you so much for teaching Ashley how to swim. My pleasure. Well, I've got to go to a business meeting, so I'm gonna let you ladies get acquainted. Make me proud. So, ready to show your mom how great you are? I will. All right, let's go. Let's go. Come on. Did you see me, Mom? Didn't take my eyes off you for a second! You're doing great. That's because Sabrina is such a great teacher. Am I ready for the pros yet? You're gettin' there. So, um, I usually bring some snacks for Ashley to enjoy after the lesson. Oh, how thoughtful of you. There we go. Granola bar and sports drink for our world champion. And for the adults. One for you and one for Parker. Oh, my gosh, no, of course not. These are for you and Parker to enjoy after dinner. Mm. Thank you, but we can't have these types of drinks in the house. Oh, why not? I'm on the program. Oh. Oh my gosh. I'm...I'm so sorry, I didn't know. I'm sure you didn't. Well, I'll see you tomorrow for our next lesson, 'kay? 'Kay. Actually, I'll...I'll call you to schedule the next lesson. Oh, you don't have to do that, I'll just show up at our regular time. I'll call you to schedule the next lesson. But I've been teaching Ashley for three times a week for the past month. She's been making such great progress. And we appreciate that. I'll call you. Got it. You are going to love going back to rehab, Ellen. So what are your thoughts on Sabrina? Ashley's not having a lesson tomorrow. I canceled it. It's obvious that Sabrina is a little more interested in you than giving Ashley a swimming lesson. I'm sorry? You lost me. I saw the two of you talking to each other. And? What, you think she's interested in me because we were talking to each other? No. Because she was straightening your tie. The hell was she doing that for? Come on, I told her I had a business meeting. She probably noticed it was crooked. Yeah, I'm sure that's not all she noticed. Babe, Sabrina and I discuss Ashley's progress, I pay her, that's it. Over a couple of cold beers? What? She brought over snacks for Ashley and two bottles of craft beer she claims were for you and for me. Now, why would she do that? I don't know. She brings over snacks and drinks all the time. She was probably being friendly. I was a divorce lawyer, remember? I can spot women like her from the next town over. Is this how we're gonna celebrate you coming home? Just... Answer one question. What? Did you tell her I was in rehab? Why would you do that? That is not something that she needs to know. I'm sorry. You're right. It was a moment of weakness. Okay. But then... why would she offer me a beer if... if she knew I had a problem? Look, I don't think she was being malicious. She probably forgot. Babe, the main thing is she's helped Ashley's confidence, Ashley adores her, and now she can swim. Honey. Get out into the world again. Find a new job. Volunteer. Do something. But don't worry about Sabrina. She's here to teach Ashley. She's helped her a lot, and that's all we need to know. Hi. Steve? Ellen Scott here. Linda? Hi! Yeah, Ellen Scott. Oh, you're...you're in a meeting? Listen, I was calling because I'm, um, ready to get back to work. You don't do family law anymore? Oh, okay. I'm sorry, I... Listen, is Mr. Stafford in? I wanted to let him know that I'm currently looking... No, I am not still in rehab. Surprise! We, uh... we weren't expecting you. Well, I don't mean to interrupt, but the last time I came over, I think I must have dropped my sunglasses somewhere in your backyard. Can I have a quick look? Wow. Sounds like someone's having a good time. Yeah. Look, I meant to call you. Ellen decided that Ashley's progressing so well that she's ready to go to the next level. Great, I've arrived just in time. With someone else. What? Yeah, um, we decided to get a medal-winner to teach her. Hold on... I may not have a medal yet, but I'm training for the national team every single day of my life. You can't just go switching a teacher on a kid like that suddenly, it's not good for them. I was also hoping that we could sit down and map out a plan for Ashley. There's so much I wanted to teach her. Uh... thank you for helping her as much as you did. Can I at least tell her goodbye? Hey. Sabrina thinks she left her sunglasses here - the other day. - Hey there. Mind if I have quick look? No. Go ahead. How's she doing? She's doing great. Having a lot of fun. I gotta jump, okay? Well, I can't find those darn sunglasses. Who knows where I might've left 'em. Anyway, Parker mentioned you found someone new to teach Ashley. I thought I'd say goodbye, but... I can't believe it. Donna Dean. The Donna Dean, bronze medalist? That's me. And the gold medal's up next. Great. Donna's gonna help me get to the Summer Games. I saw you, little dolphin, you're doing great! Mom, I have to use the bathroom. Okay, but don't run, and don't get water everywhere. So, I hear you got Ashley started. Yeah, but, I mean, how great for her that you're teaching her now. By the way, I'm a huge fan. Well, thank you. Wait, don't I know you? You two know each other. I remember now. You were training for the national team with Coach Sharky about a year ago. I used to stand on the sidelines sometimes and watch everybody. - Wait, who? - Coach Wallace. Sharky is his nickname. Best swimming coach in town. But then you suddenly had to leave the team. What was that all about? Are you angry with me? What? No. Of course not. My mom thought it would be good for a real medalist to teach me. That's why Donna's here. Well, your mom is a smart woman. You know, if Ashley were my daughter, I'd fire me and hire Donna. You would? Oh, hell yeah. Oops. I just wanted to say goodbye. Keep up the great work, okay? You have a fantastic teacher. Okay. Look. It's obvious that you bonded with Ashley. And... well, if you have the time, uh, why don't you drop by for Ashley's next lesson and hang out with us. I mean, if you want to. I'd love to. And just so you know... Ashley was my best student. Really? Yeah, I mean, look at her. She's a natural. Thank you. And thank you for being such a great sport about this. Of course. Ashley's in great hands with Donna. Yeah, she is. Go enjoy your daughter's progress. I'll show myself out. Perfect. Perfect. Can't wait to redo this place. Well, Sabrina took that better than I thought she would. And she said she'd love to stop by and hang out for Ashley's lessons. Oh, really? I'm sorry I jumped the gun on Sabrina. She really does seem like a sweet young woman. Told ya. Mm. See you tomorrow night? Unless you've changed the locks on the doors. Mm. I bought something sexy to wear. In that case, I'm definitely comin' home. Oh, before you go. Do you remember that photo of the three of us that was above the fireplace? It's gone. Babe, there's a lot of photos above the fireplace. Yeah, but this one was taken after I got back from rehab. The first time. Wait, yeah, I do remember the photo, but... I don't know where it is. We'll find it when I get back, okay? I just don't understand why it's not there. It's always there. Honey, you go to sleep. I'll see you tomorrow. - Love you. - Love you too. Hey! I'm here to hang out with you for Ashley's lesson with Donna. Uh, you're a day early. Donna doesn't get here till tomorrow and Ashley's still not back yet from school. Agh, darn it. Must have gotten my dates mixed up again. Anyway, I stopped by this super cute bakery and picked up some gourmet cookies for everyone. Yeah, I know that place. Wilka's, we go there all the time. Everything they make is so great. I know! Well, since you're here, come on in. I'll make some coffee. Great! So you're all right switching off lessons with Donna? We'll try it and see how it goes. Oh, absolutely, I think it's a great idea. Honestly, thank you for even keeping me on the team. Oh, I hope peanut butter chocolate chip's okay. You won't get any argument from me. Oh, uh, Sabrina, um... there's... Thank you. Something that's been bothering me. The other day when you brought over the, um... - The beers? - Yeah. Oh, God, I'm so sorry. Parker told me and I just wasn't thinking. Can you forgive me? Oh, of course. It's just that, as you know, I can't have any substances in the house. No... alcohol. Mm, no... prescription painkillers. No weed. I completely understand. Now... You gotta share the guilt with me. Uh-uh, these are for you and your family. I bought some for myself and it is gonna take absolutely all of my willpower not to eat them before I get home, so... Well, in that case, these are going in the cupboard for later, otherwise they'll be gone before Parker and Ashley even get here. Polish them off, they'll never know. Joking, joking. Oh. Ah. Uh... Gosh. Is everything all right? Uh, I...I... Can I get you anything? I think I need to lie...lie down. Can you see your... See yourself out? Sure. Do you need me to help you? No, I... You're not looking so good. Sweet dreams. Perfect timing. Hey, little dolphin, how was school? Oh, Sabrina, hi, it was great! Uh, where's my mom and why are you here? She had a little headache so she's taking a nap, and I'm here because I thought today was your lesson with Donna. My bad. Anyway, I was about to leave unless you want to show me what Donna's been teaching you. Yeah, wanna see? All right, girly, work that water, let me see what you know. Let's go, come on. Yes, Ashley, look at that! Oh my gosh, look at you! You look so good. Oh, my gosh! Oh, look at you! Keep going, keep going, don't stop now! Yes, girl, yes! Good job, I'm so proud of you. How did I do? Excellent. I wanna do it again. You should, but I gotta go now. I don't wanna get out of the pool yet. You don't have to. But my dad says no unsupervised swimming or else he gets angry. You know what? If you want to swim, go ahead. I'm not gonna say anything. It'll be our big girl secret, 'kay? 'Kay! Just, uh, stay closer to the shallow side for me. Promise? Promise. Honey! Baby! Babe? What are you doing? I'm sorry, Daddy, I was just... What did I tell you? No unsupervised swimming. Yeah, and where's your mom? Resting, she had a headache. Then why are you in here by yourself? I don't need supervision. I can swim, I... Get out of the pool right now. Ash, I'm not gonna say it again. Baby. Baby, wake up. Oh, where am I? Tell me you haven't been drinking. No, of course not. Did you know Ashley was in the pool by herself? Huh? You've been drinkin' again. I can't believe it. I cannot believe it. I... I wasn't drinking. I trusted you, and you did it again! I... I wasn't, I swear. Oh! Where'd you hide it this time? I know you put it somewhere. Look what I found underneath the sofa. Now, why would it be there? I don't... I don't know. Yes, you do! You put it there! Ashley was in the pool, alone! One of us is supposed to be out there watching her at all times, you know that. I... I swear, I... I didn't even know she... came home. You blacked out. No, baby, that's impossible. I... I... I... You're gonna have to go back. What? No! Please. We're not gonna lose Ashley because you can't control your drinking problem. I can't go back. - This is Parker Scott. - No, no, please! Please! No, no! Please, I can't go back! I'll check in on you every day. Ashley. Honey, honey, honey, honey. I know. You gotta get in the car. We lost Mom again. Yeah. She just wasn't ready yet, that's all. Will she ever be ready? I don't know, Ash, but right now, it's best that she be near people who can take care of her properly. I can take of her! I want to take care of her! I know you do. I do too. But first, Mom has to learn to take care of herself. Are you still mad at me? A little bit. But it's only because I don't want anything bad to happen to you. I love you more than anything in this world. You understand? - I'm sorry, Daddy. - Come here. - I'm sorry! - It's okay. Look, everyone, it's Donna Dean, world-famous bronze medalist. How'd you get in here? You didn't read the sign? "Professionals only." The exit's over there. I'm not going anywhere until you agree to stop teaching Ashley. I'm Ashley's teacher, not you. Besides, I'm better than you. Okay... prove it. You're on. See? I am the best teacher for Ashley. What is so funny? What are you laughing at? You think you got fired because you weren't a good enough teacher? It's because you wouldn't stop hitting on Mrs. Scott's husband. - That's not true. - Uh, yeah, it is. Mrs. Scott told me herself the first day I was there. Yeah, well, did she also tell you she's in rehab 'cause she's walking around drunk half the time? Oh, that's rich, coming from a pathological liar? You say you're training for the Summer Games? You haven't even been on Coach Sharky's team for over a year. Yeah, word on the street is you suddenly had to leave 'cause you kept hitting on him. You don't know anything! Maybe I don't know exactly what happened because I wasn't there, but here's my guess: You tried to hook up with him, but he told you to get lost, and you didn't like it. That's it, isn't it? Isn't it? That's why they won't let you on the national team! You got a reputation! Oh, Sabrina's a bad girl! Look, I loved Coach, okay? I loved him! And he was gonna ruin my life! I had to teach him a lesson, I had to! You had to do what? Teach him a lesson? You're sick. I'm not letting you anywhere near that kid or that family. I'm calling them right now. Guess you'll never get the gold now. - Hey. - Hey. Been a couple weeks since I saw you, so I thought I'd check in. Thanks. How are you? I heard the news about Donna. It's unbelievable. The police say she was taking anabolic steroids, say her heart just gave out. How's Ashley taking it? Not well. She hasn't wanted to go near the pool since. Look, if you think it would help, I would be happy to come over and give Ashley some catch-up lessons. I mean, if that's all right with Ellen. Actually, it doesn't matter whether Ellen's okay with it or not. She's back in rehab. What? She seemed perfectly fine the last time I saw her. - What happened? - I wish I knew. The thing is, Ellen was always able to hide her problem really well. But this time... I don't know, she must've gone on a bender. I've never seen her like that. - I'm so sorry to hear this. - Thanks. Well, if you really have the time, I'm sure Ashley would love to see you again. I think some lessons from you would cheer her up. And vice versa. - This afternoon okay? - Sure. Great. I'll see you later. Perfect. That's right, yeah. Down kick, then keep your legs straight, then do the up kick. Yeah, keep kicking around... Nice, nice. Hi. How are you today? Feeling better? I... still don't feel like myself. Not even close. But I... I had to call and see how Ashley was doing after Donna... I can't even bring myself to say it. Yeah, well... Ash took it pretty hard, so I decided to bring back Sabrina. I don't know what it is, but those two have a bond. Anyway, Ashley's smiling again. I don't think it was a good idea to rehire Sabrina. I... I don't follow. That day when she brought over the beers, she knew I was on the program. You told her. She didn't forget. She...she brought those beers on purpose. You remember that but you don't remember passing out in the middle of the day with our daughter in the pool by herself. I don't know what happened, but I swear, I was not drinking that day, I wasn't. Instead of fixating on Sabrina bringing over those beers, why don't you come clean about the fact that you were drinking that day? I wasn't drinking! And I don't know what happened, but I think Sabrina did something. Just like she did with those beers, she... she did something. You're not making any sense. I can't remember. - Yeah, because you blacked out. - No. Trust me, I swear, I... I can't! Sabrina is trouble. She's the one who's lying. Yeah, well, she's not the one that left our daughter in the pool unattended. Baby, I...I swear. Please. I've gotta go. You're teaming up on me now, okay. Can you come back tomorrow? Oh, tomorrow, I don't know. Let me... let me check. It's looking like... I can make it. Yes! Can Sabrina stay for dinner tomorrow night too? Ash, we can't take all of her time. Why not? We'll see. For now, brush your teeth and get to bed. Only if Sabrina tucks me in. Be right back. Did your mom ever tuck you in when you were a kid? No. My mother never really had time for me. She didn't really love me. What is it, sweetie? I don't think my mom loves me either. Of course she does. No, she doesn't. She's never here, she keeps making mistakes. Ashley, we all make mistakes. Your mom loves you, and your dad does too. Do you know how lucky you are to have such a fantastic dad? Last time I saw my dad, I was five years old. He used to take me swimming. He and my mom were always arguing. He was trying his best, but... it was never good enough for her. He couldn't take it. One day, packed his suitcase, kissed me goodbye, and I never saw him again. I think about Daddy every day. I wish I could bring him back, but... I can't. Anyway, trust me. Your mom and dad love you. And so do I. Good night, little dolphin. Good night, big dolphin. Let's see, all right. We have candles... That's for the diffuser. Where's the diffuser? There it is, okay, um... Wait, you brought all this here for me? Stress relief. This stuff helps, and trust me, you need it. There is... one more thing you should do. Doesn't this feel great? It does. You know, you should give yourself daily swim breaks. I mean, you clearly work out. Mainly weights and jogging. Okay, so, make swim dates with your daughter then. I bet she'd love that. That was actually my original plan. Thank you for reminding me. Race you to the other side? Okay. You win. I'm no match for you. I bet you could be. Sabrina... That's my name. I forgot to mention... this is the other way to relieve stress. You have to get up early? No, I can sleep in. - Good. - Yeah, but this coming Tuesday, I have to go to New York for two weeks. Yeah, lately I pay the neighbor to look over Ashley while I'm gone, but... I'll do it. You would? You could stay here. I would love that. I've been reading a lot about substance abuse. Addiction. Ellen, you, and Ashley will be dealing with this for the rest of Ellen's life. You're always telling me you have to think about Ashley's future, but... she deserves a mother who's reliable, who's gonna be there for her. Doesn't she? She does. I could be that for her. I don't even remember how I got here this time. But I do know... I never want to be here again. I love you all, but... I miss my family, and I want to go home. My name is Ellen Scott, and I'm an alcoholic. Good job. Vicky, why don't you go next? Mm, sure, um... I started drinking when I was 12. My friend invited me over and her parents weren't home, so we thought that it would be cool to drink some of her dad's beers, and then we drank some more. It was fun, and we just kept drinkin' 'em. We turned on the TV, and they were showing that old movie, Jaws. Okay, maybe some of you don't remember it, but it was about this huge killer shark. Huge killer shark. Huge killer shark. Huge killer shark. Huge killer shark. You were training for the national team with Coach Sharky about a year ago. - Wait, who? - Coach Wallace. Sharky is his nickname. And it really gets me because my niece is 12 now and when I... Excuse me. Hey, Ellen. Hey, we're not done yet here. Jerry, could I use my phone for a minute? Good afternoon to you too. You know the rules: Phone calls only during scheduled times with supervision. It's my friend's birthday and... last year I forgot it. I just want to send her a text and let her know how much she means to me. I just need a minute... or two. I'll be standing right here in front of you. Two minutes. Go. Reception. He's doing what? Well, where's the... Okay, you know what, never mind. Coming up. Lucky you, I got a situation on the third floor. You just bought yourself two more minutes. Thank you. - Hello? - Hi! Coach Sharky Wallace? Yeah, who's this? Hi, my...my name is Ellen Scott. I'm...I'm calling about a swimmer that you coached last year, a young woman by the name of Sabrina Jameson. I can't discuss my students with strangers. - Goodbye. - Hello? Coach Sharky? Hello? You looking forward to seeing Charlotte today? That's why I love Saturdays so much! And her mom always makes us popcorn when we watch movies. Hey, how would you feel about Sabrina spending a little more time with us? You mean, like, moving in? Not exactly. You know I have to go to New York in a couple of days, so instead of dropping you off at Mrs. Miller's, I thought maybe Sabrina could come stay here with you. That'd be great, I love Sabrina! Uh, then I guess... Mom's not coming back? Of course she is. But I just don't know when. Meanwhile, it might be nice to have Sabrina around here a little more, if that's okay with you. It's okay. Good, but Sabrina will never take the place of your mom. I just want to be clear about that. Dad, I know that. You have fun. If you need anything, let me know, call me. Okay, I know. - I love you. - I do too! Let me get the door. - Thank you, Dad. - Thank you so much again. All right, you ladies have fun. Daddy... I stopped by this super cute bakery and picked up gourmet cookies for everyone. Coach Sharky? - Yeah, who are you? - Oh, I... I am sorry to bother you, but... You're the one who called earlier, aren't you? Yes, but please let me explain. A few months ago, my husband hired Sabrina to give our daughter swimming lessons. Sabrina said that she was training for the Summer Games, but later, I found out that she wasn't and she hadn't been for a year. I am convinced that Sabrina has been lying to us. My husband doesn't think so, but I do. Please, can you help me? I feel partially responsible. I just... I didn't think that she'd continue with the... Continue to what? Sabrina was one of my students. She showed some promise in the beginning, but then she started to have some issues. You're perfect for me. You know how much I love you! I've always loved you! You're the first person I told. I didn't call the police because, even though she tried to kill me, I felt guilty about kickin' her off the team. I mean, I didn't want to completely destroy her life. You were a lot more generous than I would've been. Later, I found out that I wasn't her first, um... obsession. She has a thing for older men, and if they reject her, she freaks out and tries to kill 'em. I think one of those older men happens to be my husband. Everything okay? Listen to me carefully and do not hang up. What's goin' on? You sound like you're in a car. Where are you? That's not important. I just talked to Sabrina's old coach. What? Why? Why would you do that? I remembered something Donna said. It came rushing back to me today. Sabrina stopped training for the Summer Games and had to suddenly leave her team a year ago. I had to find out why. Sabrina told me she's been training every single day. Yeah, well, she hasn't been. Okay, well, maybe she said that just to get the job. One way or another, Ashley can swim now. Listen to me. Her coach said he had to kick Sabrina off the team because she kept hitting on him. When he rejected her, she tried to kill him! Hello, did you hear what I said? She tried to kill him! I... I can't believe that. Yeah, well, you better. He wasn't the first one. It's a pattern she has with older men who reject her. Be straight with me, have you been drinking? I am stone-cold sober! That's the other thing. I remember that day now clearly. I didn't drink anything! Sabrina came over with a box of cookies from Wilka's. I had some, she didn't, because she laced them with drugs. That doesn't make any sense. Yes, it does! It all makes sense! She drugged me to get me out of the picture because she wants to get rid of me! Okay, well, how do you explain the bottle of whiskey I found? Sabrina put it there! It had to be her! Okay, I admit, I used to hide bottles all over the house, but, under the sofa? Come on! That's for amateurs! Hold on, someone's at the door. Morning! - Business call. - Okay. Listen, I... She's already there, isn't she? Parker, she is dangerous! She cannot be around you or Ashley! I have to go. It's a beautiful pool, isn't it? Yeah, it's perfect. Ash and I are gonna have so much fun swimming in it, and even more fun when you come back and join us. Yeah, you know, I'm not leaving until Tuesday though. It's only Saturday. Oh, I know. I just wanted to get a head start, you know? Learn my way around the house, make sure I know where everything is. For Ashley. By the way, how's your training going? You know, for the Summer Games? - Great. - I guess I should know this by now, but how often do you train? - As often as I can. - The reason why I'm asking is I was hoping I could consult with your coach to see if I can get Ashley into the accelerated program. She's been doing so well. I can look into that for you. That might be difficult, though, since you're not training for the Summer Games. I don't like when people lie to me, Sabrina. I'm not lying. Good, glad to hear that. I feel so much better. Although, Ellen told me that you brought over a box of cookies. She ate them and you didn't. Why not? I wasn't hungry. I'm thinking you didn't eat them because you put drugs in them, and whatever you put in them knocked Ellen out. That's crazy! Why would I do that? So I would think Ellen was drinking again, that's why. And that bottle of whiskey under the sofa, I'm guessing you didn't do that either? Everything's going so well. Why are you playing this game with me? Why have you been lying to me from the moment that you walked into my house? You were never training for the Summer Games. You got kicked off the team because you tried to kill your coach! That's not true! Ellen tracked him down, he told her everything, so don't lie to me anymore, Sabrina! I wasn't trying to kill him! He was trying to kill me! I loved him, and he was trying to walk away from me! But that...that doesn't matter anymore, because I have you and Ashley. Look... We're a family now. Sabrina, I don't know what you're talking about, but you need to go right now. Go where? I gave up everything to be with you. We're...we're gonna start a new life together, you, me, and Ashley. I'm gonna say this one more time: You need to go. But... but we're together now. You...you love me. Like hell I do! Get out! I'm calling the police. You don't deserve me! Hey! Parker! Parker! Come here. Are you okay? Are you okay? - I'll call 9-1-1. - Okay. We're at 4202 South Parallel Avenue. Come on, Sabrina.
