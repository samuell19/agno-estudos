I'd like you to tell me about the wildest situation you've ever experienced. The definition of wild is up to you. It could be finding yourself stuck in the middle of a fight between two gangs of hooligans, bouncing in the mosh of an extreme punk rock concert, or being chased by a cougar through the jungle. Whatever you want, but it's gotta be an interesting story and it should have happened to you, okay? Our phone number is 201-5137. Call me, don't get cold feet. And since we are talking about wild stories, I'll grab this opportunity to tell you one. It's about a lonely, bored woman, who feels that something is missing in her life.

You're listening to Nightmare Radio, stories for in insomniacs who wanna stay insomniacs. I'm waiting for your call at 201-5137. We got someone on the phone. Hello? - [Jack] Hi, how are you? - Not bad, thanks. What's your name? - [Jack] Jack. - Jack. - [Jack] Yes, like Jack the Ripper. - Funny. So you got a story for me, Jack? - [Jack] I do, but the truth is that I prefer to look at you telling the stories. - Look at me telling stories? - [Jack] Yeah, I'm watching you right now. You look very pretty. - Let's see, which eye did I just blink, right or left, Jack? - [Jack] I cannot see that from where I am. - Hm, yeah, right. Wait, you sent me a gift today, right? - I did and I'm glad you liked it. - How do you know I liked it? - [Jack] Because you're wearing it right now, love. Am I wrong? [ominous music] - I'm sorry, but you're wrong. What's your story? - [Jack] Are you sure you're not wearing it, love? - Okay, I'm bored. Thanks for dialing in. Asshole. [melancholy music] [machine whirring] - I gotta unpack everything and I'm pretty beat. You guys have fun. All right, I'll see you guys tomorrow. [tense music] [TV static buzzing] [tense music] [TV static buzzing] [tense music] [glass shattering] [tense music continues] [victim screams] [tense music] [creature growls] [intense music] [tense music] Fuck. [TV static buzzing] [tense music] [eerie music] [victim grunting] [victim screams] - [Bob] And I touched my stomach and it was bleeding. - Not bad, Bob. but you were supposed to tell a story that actually happened to you. - [Bob] It did. - If it took place in your dreams, it doesn't count. But thanks for dialing in. It's almost two o'clock in the morning. We got another call. Who's there? - [Jack] Hi, my sweet Candy. It's me. - Again. - [Jack] Well, you just didn't let me finish telling you what I wanted to say. - I ain't got no time for this. You got a story or not? - [Jack] Of course I do. - So tell it. - [Jack] It happened a month ago. The main character is a young pretty girl with many friends and an interesting job. - I said the story gotta be personal. - [Jack] Be patient, my Candy sweet. - Okay, go on. - [Jack] It turns out that this girl goes to a bar with some girlfriends from work. The place was packed that night. A guy tries to buy her a drink. She says no, but he insists and she finally agrees. And then she chooses the most luxurious drink. They have a fancy French wine, hugely expensive. He spends half of his salary inviting her. So she tells him, "Wait here, I'm going to the toilet." He stays there and the girl is not coming back. Then he sees her leaving the bar with her girlfriends, sharing the wine among them, laughing really hard. Nasty, isn't it? And the worst part is that she probably doesn't even remember him now. - I think she does remember Jack, and she regrets it. She was probably drunk and wouldn't do it again. - [Jack] You think so? Maybe. What if the guy wasn't as dumb as she thought? Imagine if she humiliated the wrong person. What if the girl is doomed and she doesn't even know it? Interesting, right? - Look man, I think the guy should get over it. It wasn't such a big deal, but thanks for dialing in. - [Jack] You better not hang up on me, love. - What did you just say? - [Jack] I said, don't even think of hanging up on me. - Bye, Jack ass. I call the shots here. Let's cut to the commercials. Stay there folks. - [Announcer] I play guitar and when I play, I like to turn up the juice. So I rock with the real fruit juice taste in Bubble Yum bubble gum's new Hawaiian punch fruit punch, wet and wild watermelon, and strawberry stripe. Their full face taste keeps my jaws jamming and their blasting bubbles out of my lips like my fingers cross this guitar. Bubble Yum has three new flavors with real fruit juice taste. You gotta like the sound of that. Bubble Yum keeps it- [intense music] [ominous music] - [Announcer] Unwrap a piece of pure paradise.. [door slamming] [tense music] - Sorry we had to use the back door. The uh, the only one that hasn't been condemned. - That's okay. I'm just glad you could show me the place. - Yeah. Well, follow me. Watch your stop there, please. [rats squealing] We're just gonna go through here. - Oh, okay. - Yeah. Okay, so this is it. The crown jewel of Wavel Hill. Built in 1827, just five years before the cholera epidemic of 1832. [door slamming] - It's charming. - Yeah. So of course, uh, the power is off. So is the heat. Um, the city just can't afford to keep the boilers running. But we can turn that all back on for you if you choose to use this in your movie. - Yeah, no worries. I like it just the way it is. - Good. Okay, well uh, we should get going. If you'll just, uh, come with me. [animal footsteps pattering] Each nurse would be in charge of one floor to herself. She may have one or two people below her to help out, but that way it kept things nice and consistent for everyone. - [Chad] This place is huge. - [Sarah] Uh yeah. Three wards, 500,000 square feet, and enough equipment to treat hundreds of sick patients. - [Chad] It doesn't look that old for something built almost 200 years ago. - Oh, well the building has gradually been renovated over the years. I mean, up until the county closed at 32 years ago. We're gonna go in here. [tense music] - And what happened here? - Um, nothing you didn't show in your movies, Mr. Winchester. - Oh, so you're familiar with my work? - Yeah, a little bit. - Got guts. [door slamming] - [Sarah] You know, this institution helped a lot of people. - [Chad] I heard they weren't always that helpful here. - [Sarah] Yeah, well it's like my dad used to always say, "You can't make an omelet without cracking a few eggs." - [Chad] Yeah, I guess. [tense music] Oh yeah. Welcome to the asylum. I'm just gonna get some video footage here, okay? - [Sarah] Yeah, yeah. - Okay, let's do this. Hello to my future self. To the producers watching this with me. Hello. Oh, hi mom. I'm standing in one of the freakiest places I've seen in a very long time. Wavel Hill Sanitarium, West Virginia. Fortunately not everything is so depressing down here. Hey, it's grandma's upholstery. So according to a friend of a friend of mine who lives in the county, Wavel Hill Sanitarium became infamous for its atrocious experiments conducted on the patients between around 1925 to 1928. The most popular case is the one of a Mary Weaver. It's even said that Mary's ghost still roams these corridors, searching for something. [laughs] Classic. Hey, there she is. [tense music] - Come on, this way. So according to the medical archives, Mary was in room 502, which should be at the end of this corridor. Ah, here it is. - Oh, this is great. Oh, wow. Oh my God. Even the cheesiest horror flick wouldn't have something this obvious. Oh this, this is good stuff. Did you do this for me? - [Sarah] Don't flatter yourself. - [Chad] Here, give you a hand with this. - [Sarah] Okay. [metal clanking] [ominous music] - I can't wait to see what's inside. [door banging] Well that sucks. - Well, I don't know what you were hoping for. - I don't know, something sexier. Can you introduce yourself to the camera? - Uh, hi, I'm Sarah Davis. I work for the County of Tucker, West Virginia. - [Chad] Tell us where we are. - Uh, we are in room 502 of Wavel Hill Sanitarium. - [Chad] Can you explain to the people watching this why I so very badly wanted to come here? - Ah, uh, because of the story of Mary Weaver. - [Chad] And what is that? - Back in 1927, the body of nurse Mary Weaver was found dead in this room, laying in a pool of her own blood. It's said that she committed suicide after a psychotic breakdown following the murder of her baby. Uh, after she became pregnant, she was admitted to this hospital for anxiety. The doctor in charge believed her unborn baby was the devil, so immediately upon giving birth, he slit the baby's throat as she watched helplessly. He didn't even bother to cut the umbilical cord first. She completely lost it and was locked in this room to rot and die. It's said that she just rocked back and forth, begging for them to give her her baby back. One night she managed to break the window and using a shard of glass, she disemboweled herself completely. [ominous music swelling] - Cut. Damn, you're good. That was, that was good. What about the other rooms? - Um, yes. Uh, well, the infirmary is down the hall. - I'm in. [ominous music] - So is it true that if you listen closely, sometimes you can hear a hummed song to a dead kid? - [Sarah] Um, well, yeah, that's part of the folklore of this place. But mainly it's just scary stories told to frighten little kids. - Well that's a shame. Maybe if we're lucky we'll get a chance to hear something. [Chad humming] Mary, Mary? Oh, look at that. That's a creepy shot. [tense music] [Chad humming] [ominous music] - [Mary] Sarah. - Hey! [Sarah screams] I think I found it. - God! - What? Come on, follow me. - Okay. [wheelchair squeaking] [ominous music] [water dripping] - Now this is more like it. Do you think this is where the doctor killed that baby? - [Sarah] Um, maybe. If I remember correctly, this is the only place in the sanitarium where a woman could give birth. - You know a lot about this place, huh? - Uh, yeah. My father used to bring me here a lot as a child, you know, before they closed it down. - Really, he worked here? - Like his father and grandfather before him. I am the only one that didn't go- [glass cracking] into medicine. [ominous music] - So would your great-grandfather have been here during the Mary events? - Uh, yeah, I guess. Never really given it much thought. [tense music] That's my great-grandfather. [ominous music] - It looks like he's the only doctor in all these photos. - Uh, yeah, well that's because he was the only doctor. The county couldn't afford any more. - Shit. So the doctor that killed Mary's baby would've been... - My great-grandfather. [Mary screaming] [ominous music] - Uh, that was not a hum. What the fuck?! That was not a fucking hum. - We need to leave. We need to leave now. [ominous music swells] - Shit. Fuck. What the fuck was that? Who's there? [tense music] [Mary hissing] I said, who's there? Oh shit. Oh. - [Mary] My baby. - [Chad] Gotta be fucking kidding me. [ominous music] [Mary screaming] [intense music] - Come on, I left this open. [Mary hissing] [Sarah panting] [intense music] [intense music swells] [intense music continues] [door knob jangling] [Sarah bangs on door] - [Mary] Sarah. - No, what do you want from me?! [crying] Leave me alone. [tense music] [music box playing] [tense music] [Mary humming] [heart beating] [Mary hissing lightly] - Give me my baby. [Mary hisses] [tense music] [water dripping] - Chad? Chad? [Sarah gasps] Oh my God. - [Mary] Sarah. [Sarah gasps] My baby. [heart beating] Sarah. [intense music] [Sarah screams] [tense music] [intense music] My baby. My baby, Sarah. [Sarah screaming] [intense music continues] Give me back my baby. [Sarah whimpering] [tense music] [air swooshing] [Sarah whimpering] [air swooshing] [Sarah gasping] [heart beating] [eerie music] I want my baby. [Sarah whimpering] Give me back my baby! [intense music] [blood squelching] [body thudding] [Mary screaming] - [Candy] I don't believe you. - [Caller] I swear, that's what happened. - Up to the window part, it was okay, but the ending was just bullshit. - [Caller] I didn't make it up. My friend told me that her friend. - Maria, that story didn't happen to anybody's friend. It's an urban legend, period. - [Caller] It can't be. - Let's see, what's the name of your friend's friend? - [Caller] I don't remember, but she told me. - Find out and call me again. Will ya? We still got about an hour left. I'm still looking forward to listening to your stories. We got someone on the line. - [Jack] Hello Candy. - Stop. Is this a joke? - [Jack] No joke, girl, you owe me something. - You think I'm afraid of you, asshole? You watch too many movies, dick, thinking you're gonna scare me with that lousy psycho voice. You probably still live with your mom. Am I wrong? - [Jack] You're gonna be sorry for this. You'll see, I am going to get you. - Shut the fuck up! And listen carefully to me, Jack ass. I already know, sorry ass pervs like you, you're not doing anything to me because you ain't got the guts. Your harassment is over. If you call me again, you'll be tracked down. I will ruin your life. [ominous music] I apologize, folks. He got me riled up. Let's check out some music. We still got half an hour left. ♪ And I'm leaving more ♪ ♪ But on my knees and right back alone ♪ ♪ I got my hands in the air ♪ [ominous music] [machine rattling] Hello? [Jack exhaling] I'm calling the cops right now, piece of shit. Hello? [phone beeping] [disconnect tone echoing] [tense music] [ominous music] [Jack knocking on window] [intense music] [ominous music] [footsteps bumping] [tense music] - Candy. Candy. Where are you? I am going to find you, Candy. Candy. I know you're in there. I'm going to tell you a story now. It's about women that go out at night. It's dark and they're all alone. - I said, "Listen," "I saw you in emergency just last week." That's when I realized he just wanted the company. Can you imagine being so lonely you have to stick things up your bum? I mean, there are some really incredible moments. I help people. They do make it worth it, but the rest of it is just bed pans and... How far did she move out? - Not far enough. - [Ellie] Did you bring her anything? - Just you. Oh wait, I think this is the turn off. [tense music] - See her much? - [Liz] Once or twice. - Once or twice? - No, it's the next one. [automatic window closing] - Liz, eight eight months? Once or twice? - Once. No, she doesn't even try to pretend anymore. I mean ever since you left, photos of you everywhere. It's quite funny, really. There's not one picture of me. I just can't handle that woman without you. - I need something to eat. - The last thing that she said to me was that I was useless. - You've never been useless. [crickets chirping] [door clanging] [Liz urinating] [tense music] [stranger panting] [ominous music] [phone dialing] - Police. I said, "Police!" Ah! [tires screeching] [Liz panting] [tense music] He's got my sister. He turned near the Reed Drive turn off, I think. [ominous music] Near um- [car horns honking] [tense music] [car horns honking] [tense music] [crickets chirping] [leaves rustling] [items banging] [Liz gasps] [tense music] [ominous music] [tense music] [ominous music] [car hazards clicking] [Liz gasps] [baby crying] [ominous music] Ellie, oh my God, Ellie! [baby crying] [ominous music] [Liz crying] [baby crying] [ominous music] - You see, Candy, looks can be deceiving. You should be careful how you judge people. You can be mistaken and things can go really bad. [tense music] [determined music] Candy, are you ready for me? [intense music] Candy? How did we get to this point? Ever since that night in the bar, I just can't stop thinking about you. I have to have you and I will, whether you want it or not. So these are my two options for you. Are you listening, Candy? Option A, you open the door, you let me in, you let me have you, and then I let you be. I spare your life and I leave. Sounds good, doesn't it? Option B, I break that door down and I take you by force and then I kill you and I take my sweet time with that as well! So what's it gonna be? Option A or option B? You have to choose one, Candy. What's it gonna be, A or B? On the count of three. One, two, three. [lock clicks] [door creaking] - Make it quick and go away. [tense music] [thunder cracking] [tense music] [ominous music] [person panting laboriously] [person panting laboriously] [water dripping] - This is all the yield? We have to start taking on more than one at a time. Father, I can- [tool banging] - God damn it, Lucas! [water dripping] She's getting worse. [tool banging] [tense music] [Sheep baaing] - Is this Chateau Sauvignon? - The very same. - You still open? - Yeah, we can accommodate. I'll be with you shortly. - Thanks. [water splashing] We have company. - Send them back, it's late. - But we need their- [hand smacking] - Send them back, it's late. [tense music] [lively piano music] - Enjoying what you see? Let me know if you guys have any questions. - Can we try your house vintage, please? - Of course. And you're in luck. - Oh, how's that? - It's on the house for the last customers of the day. - Oh. [singer singing in French] Thank you. - Mm-hm. - Well, to my future little doctor, [glasses clink] and to a lovely weekend together. - Congratulations, that's a pretty big deal. - [Mother] Thank you. - Fill me up. - Did you even savor it? - No, mother, what's the difference? - Coming from far? - Mm. Oh uh, Montreal, actually. - Well, hey, I am supposed to be closing up, but I could give you a quick tour of our barrel cave. [gate rattling] [tense music] - This is exciting. [tense music continues] - French Huguenots actually settled in the region in the 17th century and grew vines here, making Chateau Sauvignon one of the oldest continually operated vineyards in the new world. We still use those European vines in our experimental process. This way we're ensuring that you're getting those truly unique and nuanced flavors in the wine. - Uh, what's experimental about it? - Take a whiff. - Oh, that was almost... - Meaty. - No! [skull cracking] [ominous music] - [Son] Oh my god. [glass shattering] Oh, ma! Oh, oh my. Wake up! Fuck you! [killer yelps] [flesh squelches] [son screaming] Oh my fucking God! [son panting] [tense music] The fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. [tense music] No. [tense music] [son screams] [tool banging] [son gurgling] - You wanna do this? Get over here. Now! Find the artery. At an angle. [victim gasping] [blood squelching] [tense music] [spoon tapping] [wife panting] Don't be like that. [wife panting] He needs this. [tense music] [water dripping] [ominous music] [tense music] [footsteps bumping] [tense music] [metal music wailing] [radio pinging] - It's three o'clock in the morning. This is the end. We usually close the transmission with a story, but tonight, not that I don't have a story, it's just that I don't feel like telling it. [ominous music] This was Nightmare Radio, where horror stories never end. [intense metal music]
