[low murmuring] Also... I'm collecting for Malik Hayes' service next Friday. His mother could really use your help. Okay? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Quality speech. [chuckles] Uplifting. What? I'm gonna need you to talk to these fools in payroll. They won't give me my damn check. [scoffs] Listen to the announcements. Nobody's getting paid this week. Downtown messed up payroll again. I'm gonna need something to hold me over. Like 300. When am I going to get my nine back? Not the next time I get paid, but the next time after the next. Mm. On my soul. Or... this is just part of your plan to get me to move back in? - [buzzer buzzing] - Funny. [man on PA] All persons without assigned homerooms, go to the south auditorium for further instructions. [sighs] Today will be a chance to sign up for ROTC and the Mathletes club... Tell you what. Bring me five kids from this list... and I'll give you the three. So, you want me to go find fools now, but I'm a security guard. I secure shit. Then go secure your job. ["Apache" playing] Hi, yes. I'm from the high school-- [door slams shut] Hey, man, you seen Deshawn Hall? Man, fuck you. There's a line over here. Hey. - Y'all seen Tony? - [man] Hey, fuck off, man. - Young buck, you seen Tony? - Tony dead. Dead dead, or not-around-here-no-more dead? Dead dead, motherfucker. Fucked around and got smoked. Damn. Yo, let me hit that. Man... you're not supposed to be smoking. Nigga, you ain't supposed to be smoking. Fuck is wrong with this... Man. Come on, Trey Smith. Get down here.

We got another metal detector opening. Come on, let's go. [door buzzing] [knocking at door] Hi. Is, uh, August Monroe here? Who's asking? Uh... Romelo Reese. I work at the high school. It says August hasn't been in class since last October. That can't be right. October? Mm-hmm. That's right. He been ill. [hip hop music blaring in background] Look, you all know this, so what exactly are you here for? He been ill. Hm? I take my son's work to school. Y'all already know this. Oh. Okay. That's cool. Yeah, but it's a budget thing. They actually need him in the classroom. - A budget thing? - Yeah. So... you gonna take a bullet for him? Well... [chuckles] That's actually not in my job description, so, no. Right. See... Y'all want me to send my son off to the slaughter. I ain't gon' do it for no budget. [music continues] Is your son in the next room making music? Well, thank you, Ms. Monroe, for your time. Hey, uh... mind if I use your bathroom real quick? Ever since I got back from Iraq, every five minutes, I gotta use one. Thank you. [music continues] [Ms. Monroe] Baby, turn the music down. [flushes toilet] [music stops] - I put my headphones on. - [Romelo] Hey, man. Yo, man, that is cold as hell. Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, relax, man, look. I work at the high school. All right? Yo, you make that beat? How long it take you? Damn. I ain't never met a deaf producer before, man. How you-- [raises voice] How you make a beat? Huh? You just feel the bass and you just build around that? Two minutes. Two... minutes? Man, I swear to God, you cold as hell, man. - [shouts] Ma! Mama! Ma! - Hey! - Ma! Ma! Ma!

What's wrong with him? - Out through the mouth. - What's going on? Big man, just breathe. Get out! Ma'am, I was just talking to him about music. I'm a manager, not just-- Get out! - Okay! Okay, ma'am. - Get out! I just-- [wheezing] [Ms. Monroe] August. Hey. [man on PA] Attention, students. Please be advised, today at 2:30, we have our weekly lockdown drill in the auditorium. Attendance is mandatory. - [man] Understand, ma'am, she's not-- - [Ms. Monroe] I don't care. Where is she? [man] Please, you can't just walk in there. What the fuck is wrong with you people? Yeah. Well, I was coming out of the bathroom, I heard music, went to where the music was playing, kid started screaming. That's what happened. You went into a student's room without parental supervision? Hey, hey, hey, hold up. You're making it sound inappropriate. It was. The kid is incredible. All right, he's some type of... retard savant. Don't call him that. He's... He's fragile. He's a machine... that makes a beat a minute, just like Tone. He's different. You're gon' make me regret this. You promised me you were done with that music shit. You told me you were down for this job, remember? I won't do nothing. On my soul. [door buzzer buzzing] - [knocking at window] - [cereal spills] Hey. I was holding the bell. Get away from my window before I call the cops! A'ight. Just have an hour to talk music before they get here. - I ain't supposed to talk to you. - Harriet Tubman wasn't supposed to run. That doesn't make it a bad idea. Hey, hey, hey, Aug-- August, August, August, hey. - Hey, man, calm down, all right? - [panting] Breathe. Breathe, come on, in and out. All right? Hey. That track the other day? It was too fast, man. Slow it down. That's what all the great ones do. Here. I'mma leave you this. Clean up the cereal. [upbeat Latin music playing] [gunshots] [gunshots continue] - [police siren blaring] - [hyperventilating] [buzzer buzzing] All right. Come on, Oaktown 357. Let's go. - [beeping] - You're good, young thug. Go. [man on PA] ...to the Malik Hayes family. They could really use your support. [door buzzer buzzing] [Romelo] Damn. What'd you do, pour the whole box of cereal in that bowl? I wasn't expecting you to know about Nomad. Thought you was one of those old head hip hop dudes. No, man, I go hard on my Brazilian shit. What you know about 'em? YouTube. After J. Cole sampled Milton Nascimento, I went hard on Brazil. Yeah, I got some underground shit from Trinidad, but... - couldn't fit it on the disc. - Why you even use CDs? USB is better. Old head, old habits. Man, I used to make tapes. You don't know nothing about the pain of making the perfect mixtape. Look, August. I wanna help you with your music, man. You wanna make a bag of money? Why you shrugging? Man, we gotta move on this, man. I gotta get you with the right MC, get you some studio time. - We got label meetings-- - Can I do it online? Online? Nigga, do you know who I am? - Security guard at my school. - No. Yeah, I am, but I'm also a dope-ass manager, man. I'm the one that discovered Tony Bigs. You know who Tony Bigs is, right? Everybody do. All right. But I ain't never heard nobody talking about you. I created that nigga, man. I got him studio hours. I hounded GCI till they played his shit. That was all me. - Merch. - On my mama's grave. You can't stain me. Check the liner notes, young'un. I'm all over that shit. I can make you the most famous 17-year-old in Roseland. Nah, I'm good. You're good? Don't look like it. They up a pole on these music cats. They killed Tone while he was getting a sandwich. - [door chimes] - [gunshots] [police siren blaring] - They shot Bango. Lil' Jeff. - [police radio chatter] You gonna have your ass in Paris eating croissants and shit. Man, you think Kanye still kicking it on the South Side? Hell, no, man. He up in Beverly Hills. Actually, he's in Calabasas. What's the difference? The nigga eatin'. You want to eat? [Romelo laughs] Hey. Ah. So you making house calls now? [laughing] Deshawn came back today. Really? Mm-hmm. - So I got one. - You got one. Wanna come inside? I got that green tea you like. [hip hop beats and keyboard playing] [keyboard phrase repeats] [beats playing] [keyboard phrase repeats] [beats playing] [Kari's voice vocalizing on track] [Kari sings out vocal phrase in background] [Kari vocalizing] Okay. Okay, okay. That thing look about good. [chuckles] Don't worry, you'll get one, too. Hey, I heard you using my new shit. And I'm gonna need my cut. That's my best hook yet. [chuckles] You'll get a credit. A credit? Boy, you must be crazy. I'm your big sister. Don't play me. Yeah, I see you looking. This is Chef Boyardee right here. This is perfection. [August] Looking like Chef Cardio Arrest. Stop talking mess. Do you want one or not? [smoke alarm beeping] August, what are you doing? Oh, my God! [muffled] Boy, what are you doing? What's wrong with you? Sorry, Mom. I-I forgot to watch it. [beeping continues] [groans] Hey. Where you going? I need my toothbrush. And my head scarf. I got to go home. Come on, babe. Come on. Get back in bed. Why? Because you're my wife. Estranged. I hate it when you say that. Makes it seem like we don't like each other. What's this? Come on, Vanessa, you're still on this? I love you. Two people who file their taxes separately can still love each other. We should be under one roof. Look, babe. I'm going to be the man that you want me to be. I'm going to make you proud of me. [reporter] Another young life taken. Another mother left grieving. Her daughter, just one of 14 people killed by gun violence on a weekend that saw 54 Chicagoans injured by gunfire. And still no answer to the plague of violence that has become, for so many, just another day... It's 2:30 a.m., Ma. Your ankle is gonna swell up. Come on, let's get you to bed.

[buzzing] [exhales deeply] [knocking at door] [Romelo's voice echoes] Come on, man. You in or you out? [breathing heavily] Come on, man. You already let me up. What's up? [knocking at door] You was right about the tempo. But the people need to hear what you got locked up, man. They deserve to hear your gift. And if we can get your ass some money, even better. Man, it's just got to be me and you. Can't do no shows. No meetings. Everything we do got to be in this house. Just need something to help my moms out. [instrumental track playing] [hip hop beats playing] [tempo changes] Okay, so now you just flexin' on me. Nah. Now I am. [beat changes] Hey, hey, whoa, whoa. Sound a little boomy right there. Speaker's kind of old. - [music stops] - It was my pop's. Mama said he dodged a bunch of bullets just to come home to a heart attack. Hm. Died waiting on the ambulance. Damn. [music continues playing] - [music stops] - Yo, you got to go. Hey, what... Come on. Come on, man. How many more of those you got stashed away? You gotta go. My mom gets home in 11 minutes and 11 seconds. - You gotta go. - Okay, man. That means I got at least, what, eight, nine minutes before she get here. Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, August. Okay. I'm out. [panting] [police siren blaring] [man] Nah, I don't think that really works, man. [car door closes] Nah, because, like... Nah, 'cause her girl's coming, too. They ain't gonna have room for all that shit. You try to tell him that, he's gonna... he's gonna tax you. - Keep the change. - [woman] Thank you. Have a good one. - [phone chiming] - [sighs] - Shit. - [woman] Next. What is going on here? Terrence. - [scoffs] - What's up, Terrence? Uh, Romelo, what's going on, dude?

You know, we all gotta do our part to help the kids, right? I feel you. It's good to see you, man. Same here, man. - Serendipity shit. - Yeah. Hey, you know, uh, I'm getting back in the game, right? Yeah, man. You, uh... - You always had an ear for it. - Yeah, you know, uh... I would love to, but, uh... I just snuck out for that six-piece, know what I'm saying? No, I hear you, man, but, you know, got this young, hot producer I'm working with right now. Thinking we could put him with somebody on your roster, and we could make things happen like we used to. For sure, man. When you get that demo, holla at me. Ah. Good to see you, bud. Yeah. - I'll holla at you. - [car engine starting] [synth music notes playing] [Kari's voice vocalizing] [vocalizing phrase repeats] [sighs] Slow down. Slow it down. [sighs] [Kari's voice vocalizing] [phone chiming] We got a quiz tomorrow. I had no idea. I did not study for it. I'm not ready for it. And I'm not finna study for it. - Of course you not. - [Laz] Niyah! Hey, yo, Niyah! What you looking like that for? What's up, Lazarus? What's up, what's up? Nothing much. What's going on? Not much. I'm just seeing you out lacking and everything, you need somebody protect you. [Niyah scoffs] I'm good, Laz. [chuckles] [August] Oh, hell, nah. What you mean? I'm just being real. - [Niyah] A'ight. - What? - Be real. - [phone ringing] - Okay. - A'ight. Yo. [distorted voice] You're in the wrong neighborhood. Stay away from her, goofy-ass nigga, before I shit in your throat. [trap music playing] Hey. Shut it off, man. [music stops] - Man, what's the issue? - The issue? Ain't nothing special about that. Anybody with a drum machine can do that. August, you... you can't create... what you hear other people doing, man. You got to create shit that people don't just hear, they feel it. Just push... the button, August. Just push it. [minor key tune playing] [beats playing over tune] [groans] [laughs] All right. Mama got some classics, man. Yeah. She ain't never heard of a Swiffer? [laughing] Yeah. Wait till you hear this. You gonna like this right here. [upbeat funk tune playing] [grunts] I'm sampling that. Uh-huh. See? This was the original sample right here. [hip hop track playing] [music stops] - What happened? Why's it doing that? - Damn, the shit crashed. - Okay. - That shit was fire. Fuck it. We'll make it again. [hip hop track resumes] [Vanessa] Romelo, how can you be a manager and miss the security meeting? The superintendent is literally asking me to fire you. Okay. I-I like that. No, no, not you. Not you. Hold on. Man, where you get this from? The fact that you don't know that this comes from Al's is a goddamn crime. - You sure you know what you're doing? - Why not? See, I play the piano. That's a different kind of percussion instrument. Look, man, your technique is on point, but you got, like, 20 samples in there, man. - That shit ain't speaking to me. - It's only eight. The hit is never when the producer puts the entire kitchen sink in there. You know so much, you do it. Those that can't do, nigga, we teach. Look, man. Like, RZA. He would hit all the vocals on the C. Like, middle C. Then he'd put the drums on the lower octave of the C, then the bass line he'd put on the D. Right? Then he would just... Kept moving around on the melodies and shit, man. I know I'm probably talking Japanese to you. Nah. Nah, nah, nah. - I'm straight. - Okay. RZA, he never had Froot Loop shit like y'all got on your computers now, man. Nah, he did everything with one hand, and at the same time. He had them niggas rhyme into his keyboard, and it had to be perfect, or they had to start all over again from the beginning. That's what made it so gritty. Nothing false. You felt the struggle in the craft and the life. [synthesized horn tune playing] [music stops] Hey, man, you got a tag yet? All them young producers got one now, man, so you know-- [playing sample of Romelo's voice] August, just push the button, man.

August home? He's asleep. [clears throat] I just wanted to ask him about some prank calls I was getting. Ain't nobody seen him since he spazzed out at school. I thought he was in a nuthouse, on some shock therapy shit. No. Whoa, you watch your language now, Lazarus. You right. I apologize. Well, you could tell him we out here and we waiting on his return to glory. Have a good night. [door lock clicks] That's why I don't want you hanging out with them thugs. You gonna bury me, not the other way around. [police siren blaring] [Romelo] So when you coming back to school? It's too hard. Hard? Come on, August, you ain't stupid. Not like that. There was this incident. I get these... How you call 'em? They like nightmares. But you awake. Everything started spinning. Can't barely breathe. It's like somebody's standing on your chest. Just won't get off. Used to get 'em real bad at night. So my mom said I don't have to go nowhere after dark. Then I started getting them at school, grocery store. So Mom said I don't gotta go out no more. - Out where? - Out, out. I stay here. - It's gonna be different after we move. - She got money? 'Cause we in Roseland and... this ain't exactly the penthouse. She been looking. I'm just saying, man, shit's expensive. [phone chiming] Boy, what you looking at? Mm-mm. What's her name? Niyah.

You gonna hit her with your creepy window game, or y'all talking? Mostly creepy window game. Nah, I seen better car accidents, man. I mean, no survivors, except for the dude that was pulling himself out of the wreckage with nubs where his hands used to be. He was still on fire. - [music playing on headphones] - August. August!

How do you think that makes me look? He wasn't smoking, he wasn't drinking, he was just out having a good time. His mother could sue the school. - Come on. - She just had you arrested. You know what? As a matter of fact, this is my fault, for believing that hustle about you needing this damn job. But I did need it. Always looking for something shinier. I'm a high school rent-a-cop. - Zero shine to that, trust me. - Mm. Vanessa, this kid is our way back in. I'm really trying to help these kids, and you out here trying to get rich off of 'em. - Hey, Vee, that is not-- - Don't fucking touch me. I'm about a second away from busting you in your damn mouth. Just sign the damn papers. - Vanessa, come on. - Stop playing this house shit. I just took the boy to a block party! Really? [car engine starting] So, you're just gonna leave me standing here, huh? I wasn't trying to be disrespectful, Mom. No one loves you more than me. You know that, right? And you know that I need you. It's just you and me now. - I just thought we was-- - [pounds table] What? You thought you'd be back before I got home? I got to be able to trust you in this house. Everybody liked the song that me and Romelo made. And... Niyah was there. Oh, Niyah? Oh. So you got your nose open now. Is that why you acting so crazy? Oh, you think you're grown now, okay. I mean, you're making decisions that affect this house, so you must think you grown. All I did was go to a party. And kids get killed at parties every day. - I wasn't even thinking about that. - Well, I know that's right. If something had happened to you, August... Anything could've happened to you. - But it didn't. - And-- Don't. Don't you make it seem like I'm the crazy one. I gotta go to work. She's right. [knocking at door] [Romelo] Come on, man, open up. I bought gyros. I can't. Come on, last night didn't end right. All right? But we got real momentum, August. We got to keep moving on that. Damn, man. You just don't get it. I should've never let you talk me into all this stuff. - My mom, she-- - Hey, look, hey, hey, August, we got to keep moving on that, all right? She'll get over it, man, trust me. We can't stop the creative process, man, look, because-- [door locking] [Terrence] You ever played billiards before? She called it pool. I thought maybe she was swinging. I wasn't sure. - [Cabrini] Guys, kill the noise. - [Terrence] Okay. I'm saying we got to start that cross-branding shit. We got to brand you, get that drink, the-- the Cabrini Martini, you know what I'm saying? What's going on in here? [Romelo] Huh? Sitting back thinking about how you did Tone. - That was grimy as shit, bro. - You don't know nothing about that. The karma not right. You got to work on that redemption. Mister, what did you do? What'd I do? Ten percent? Of your ten percent? That's the best I could get? - Me? - Yeah, nigga. - [Mister scoffs] - It ain't nothing personal, Ro. You still my dog. It's just business. Terrence, come on, man. What the fuck is going on? She is my artist. It's what homegirl said. It's nothing personal, man. Come on, Mister. You know I'm trying to get this shit right again. Trying to get this shit-- Romelo, she's too big for you, dog. What? Dog, you had to come beg me to let her open for free. Hey. Terrence, fuck you, man! Fuck you, man! I came to you with a motherfucking deal, man! I put hard work into this shit, man! You're not doing none of that. Back up. Can't let you put your hands on my partner like that. - Your partner? - Back up. My partner. Oh. We both know you would've fucked this up, man. Okay. Fuck you. Hey, man, it is what it is. Cabrini's part of the Ill Note family now. But you do recognize talent. Yo, what about that, uh, that producer kid, what's his name? Austin? [Terrence] He's all you got, Romelo. Let's do business. [exhales] - What's up, man, how you been? - Like you give a fuck. So, what you say to her? - What? - Niyah. She ain't talking to me. I heard you and her been kicking it. So I know you sneak dissin' on me. - I didn't say nothing about you. - Bullshit. I ain't step to her all last year because of you, and now we talking, and you just wanna pop back up? That's some bitch-ass shit. Why she like your fat ass anyway? Unless you're fucking with me? She like me. [grunting] [Laz] You're supposed to be my homie, nigga! Man, why you got that here? I wasn't gonna dead your ass. I always got it. But you don't need it. How the fuck you gonna tell me what I need? I'm out there doing what I gotta do, and your ass up here not doing shit! You gonna be there when I need you? Huh? You gonna have my back? That's what the fuck I thought. I better not catch your ass on the block again, 'cause I promise you it won't be no words next time. Fake-ass bucket boy. [panting] [man] You look so beautiful. Eh? Princess. - [woman] Three, two, one. - [laughter] Dab. [laughing] Where you at, August? [indistinct chatter] [hip hop music playing] Girl, come on, just forget about him. Don't worry about it. I promise you, I'm good, - I'll text you, all right? - All right. I love you, girl! I ain't playing! You better be there! [phone chimes] Coming down, Romeo? I can't tonight. Tonight? If not now, when? I don't know. Stop acting like a little bitch! - It ain't even like that. - That's exactly what it is. Your ass scared. Got to make shit good again. The hell is wrong with you, August? This Chicago. Both my brothers is dead, and I'm standing here! I'm outside! My moms need me. You wrote me that song. You took me to that show. You got me standing outside in this itchy-ass dress, and you can't even come out the damn house, nigga? You embarrassed me in front of my friends! Lose my number. Niyah. You gonna have more fun without me tonight. Fuck you. [piano notes playing] August. August, what did you... What-- Baby? What are you doing? What is it? [breathing heavily] It's okay. It's okay. I just wanna be normal. [Kari's voice vocalizing] [vocalizing continues] [door buzzer buzzing] [Ms. Monroe] Who is it? Romelo. Didn't I tell you to stay away from my son? I didn't come here for that. I came to talk to you. "You should've ran it by me first"? That's your apology? Hm. I'm not apologizing, just explaining what happened. Hell, I'm the one who went to jail. You ever ask yourself why a grown-ass man is hanging out with a teenager? I'm just trying to show August the bigger life. You know, he needs-- No, don't talk to me about what my son needs. He needs friends. He needs a purpose. No, he needs to make it to his 18th birthday. Your son is very talented. Not too many people can do what he can. He can do big things in this world, but he's got to be in the world. Listen. Come on, take a listen. That's your son. [Romelo] Mm-hmm. [hip hop track plays faintly on earbuds] [knocking at door] Goddamn. What happened? [August] Told you, I can't do music no more. You didn't have to get all dramatic with it. Hey, you know... it's time to upgrade you anyway. I got a... got a plug that can give us free codes to Pro Tools. I don't know if I did it 'cause I liked it... or I do it 'cause she liked it. - Who? - My sister. She used to find the most... random samples. They killed her. Yeah, I heard. Fucking playground on Perry. I never even heard the bang... It just burned. [August] Went right through her. And buried itself right here. Man, she ain't even do nothing.

You think I'mma tell you that it's okay for you to fuck over a 17-year-old kid? I'm not absolving you of that, Romelo. Goddamn, Vee. Why you still acting like I ain't shit? 'Cause you ain't shit. Oh, my God. What the fuck is wrong with you? You're such a fucking idiot. [Romelo groans] I never gave a damn about your fucking deals, Romelo. Shit changes. This is my chance to get back on top. Romelo, you are doing this for you. This ain't for me. I need you to get out my house, Romelo. I need you to get the fuck out of my house. This our house. Get the fuck out of my house! [Vanessa] Thank you. [Ms. Monroe] I got this... for you. Come here. I thought you should maybe go in there... looking professional. [chuckles softly] You know you ain't have to take off work. You are signing a record deal, okay? There's no way I was gonna miss that. Thanks, Mom. You're welcome. You both ended up looking like your daddy. [chuckles] [laughing] [exhales] August, you know we don't have to do this if you don't want to, right? Yes, we do. [door buzzer buzzing] - [beeps] - We on our way down. Uh, I'm not sure what Ro told you about this place, but... it's a home. It's a home for artists like August. And we're inviting him into our home, man. We want you to be a part of our family, for a long, long time. Ordinarily, it would take, like, four weeks to kinda issue a check and lick the stamp and send it out. But you know, I'mma make a call, get you that check in two weeks. How does that sound, big dog? You hear that, Ma? We're gonna move. All right. Ms. Monroe. You're up first. Um... Hey, my lawyer looked everything over and it's all good, so... all you have to do is sign. There you go. August. [Terrence] You're up, dude. - I don't got to tell this guy twice. - No. Damn. [Terrence] A man who knows what he wants, just like me. Beautiful. Now we celebrate. That's what's up. - [Ms. Monroe] That... That's it? - Yeah. That's it. [Terrence] We've got some champagne. All right. Watch out now. Watch out now. - [cork pops] - Boom. There we go. King Monroe, Ms. Monroe. Soda pop for you, August. Hey, Romelo, you want the bubbly or do you want something brown, man? If you don't tell me, I'm just gonna have to pour you something, dealer's choice. Jesus. [lighter lid clicks] - Yo, what the hell are you doing? - My contract! You don't need that. It was fucked. What are you talking about? The song goes to number one, he doesn't even sniff a royalty check. Stop talking right now. Stop talking. Why'd you do that? My moms needed that money. We can get the money someplace else, big man. - I'm gonna litigate the fuck out of you. - Do it. I told you not to get in his head. Nah, forget the contract, that shit's burned. Hey. Romelo, I just gave you 40 grand, man. - Wait, what? - Did you already forget that? I'm not touching this money. - Why he give you that money for my music? - Because he lied to us, baby. It's complicated, all right? Look, we can get a deal someplace else, trust me. If you trust him, you might end up like Tone. Yeah. That was a thick-headed kid who had no idea his best friend was robbing his end. What's he talking about? What am I talking about? Around the time that Tone got killed, this dude had his label so strapped that he had to steal checks from Tone's moms just to dig hisself out. That was a long time ago. Okay. That was a long time ago. Let's talk recent history. Your boy over here didn't try to change anything from your deal, August. Just a, uh... what was it, a pay bump? And a producer credit for hisself. Fuck you, Terrence. Nah, you done fucked yourself, dude. Well, Chicago is scorched earth. I mean, you and me are done, man. I was your only friend. We done. He's just a child, Romelo. August? August. August. Hey, August. Come here, man. [distorted soundscape] August! [knocking at door] [Romelo] August? Just... Just open the door so I can explain myself to you, okay? - August? - [Ms. Monroe] He's not here! [sobbing] He's not... He's not here... [sobbing] He's not here. Mrs. Monroe? I will bring him home safe. I promise you that. I promise you that. [sobbing] [thunder rumbling] I figured you'd be here. Your moms is worried, man. Wasn't nothing good about that deal, all right? Believe me, there's better shit out there for us-- Man, you ain't been 100 about nothing, from the jump. The whole time you were running game? Behind my back? You right. I was dead wrong about you. You see that building way out there, the one with the blue lights on it? Me and Tone, we grew up right there. Man, I'm tired of you throwing that nigga name in my face. Hey. Look here, man. I came up in a Robert Taylor Home... making tracks with Antonio from two floors down, man. Next thing I know, we got our own imprint on the biggest label in the world. You're too young to remember this, but... we didn't make it out of that place. My pops moved in in '71... and died in that motherfucker. I didn't know much back then, but I knew one thing. I was never going back. I was trying to prove that shit to everyone. That's how I fucked up. Get a loan to pay a loan. You dip into another artist's pocket, now I'm bailing water like it's the Titanic. You saying that you done fucked every nigga that you done worked with? Nah. I'm saying that after the lawsuits... after the IRS done sucked my bone dry of its fucking marrow, man, I came right back here to the South Side, damn sure that this wasn't how my life was supposed to be. I'd do anything to get back. Anything. But today... today, I learned that that wasn't true. You see, man, that short money... that shit don't last. I done that. I gotta get my mom back her life. Ain't on you. - It is. - Mm-mm. She fucked up 'cause of me. [sniffling] - Kari is dead 'cause of me. - Nah, man. You're a kid, man. That ain't on you. You know... I'm not good. You get that? I'm not good. Everywhere I go, I see it. She reminded me of what I done. Hey. Your sister wouldn't want you carrying around that, man. On God, that's not what she'd want. This is Chicago, August, and it ain't on you to change that shit. [sobbing] I just miss her. I miss her so much. I know. Come here. I know, man. I got it from here. All right, big man. Romelo. [thunder rumbling] Thank you. I got you. [police siren blaring] Be careful. I'll see you tonight, Ma. [Kari's voice vocalizing] [vocalizing phrase repeats] [piano matches Kari's vocalizing] [hip hop beats playing over Kari's vocalizing] Come on, people, let's go. Come on, people, let's move. Let's move. Welcome back, Mr. Monroe. Thanks, Ms. Robinson. Come on, don't be late your first day back. Yes, ma'am. I'm happy to see you. It's a little boomy. Bring up the mids. Levels are good. I know. Wow. Didn't think I'd ever see you around here again. So? What up?
