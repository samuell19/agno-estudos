Abby? I see you're in your happy place. I hope you don't mind I let myself in again. I know you don't open for another hour. You know you're welcome anytime. You always work so hard, especially around the holidays. Half the time I don't know if I'm coming or going but this place, it makes me so relaxed. Even if it is just for a few minutes. That's how I feel about the greenhouse. I just shut out the world. Speaking of which... Raspberries. I picked them from the greenhouse this morning. Thank you. Are you sure there nothing else I can help you with? Hey do you want to cook? The Inn is without a chef for the next few days. Oh, I thought you got somebody to replace Matilda while she's away? So I did, but he just canceled on me last minute. I wish I could help, but I'm prepping for the Festival next week. And my sisters are coming over. We're making Christmas chocolates. You better get me the mint ones again this year. No, I think I'll be able to manage the guests without Matilda. But maybe I'll start by serving some fresh raspberry scones. You're not baking the scones, are you? Yes. How hard can it be? I'll add a little extra sugar for some extra Christmas sparkle. These are so good. We look forward to hosting you. Thank you. We'll see you Friday. Word just in. The National Cooking Network crew is staying with us for the By the Bay Christmas Food Festival! The Brook's Point Inn is going to be fully booked! Well, Merry Christmas to us. Fully booked! I haven't said those words in years. What? You have a date? Very funny, Brad. Aren't you supposed to be fixing a toilet somewhere? Happy to report that the toilet in room seven is no longer running. However we do need to replace the ceiling fan. Okay. Let's go room to room and make a list of repairs. I want everything in full working order for the Festival. Way ahead of you. There's been a repair list for a while. Well look at you. Okay, why is this so long? Chipped paint on the stairwell. That's charming. That's fine. Ah, there's a fine line between 'charming' and 'run down'. Well the building's a hundred years old. It's allowed to show its age a little bit. Well, the Brook's Point Inn is not about swank. We are about history, community and that little personal touch. The NCN crew will love their stay here. Everybody always does. [dripping sounds] [dripping sounds]But that, however, needs fixing. I'm on it. I'm on it. Thank you. I'll talk to Gran about hiring some extra hands. But in the meantime I think we're all going to need to step up and do a few extra chores. Okay? Thanks guys. Abby, wait. Ah, where are you going? I'm going to make some scones for our continental breakfast. I got these fresh raspberries from Cheryl's. I'm going to put some white chocolate on top a little sugar. Ah, they're going to be so yummy and Christmasy. Why don't I call the Diner. I can get some vouchers for the guests. No. That's not necessary. Plus it's not in the budget. It's my job to make sure everything runs smoothly here. So we don't have a chef, our guests are hungry, I'm going to fix it. I'll call the fire department, give them a fair warning. Thanks Brad. There's no one here. The streets are empty. Yeah, that's exactly why you're there. It's not New York. Brooks Point Harbour is the perfect place to lay low. Your reservation's under Gosling. Jason, just relax. Get some sleep. Try to enjoy it while you can. We're going to have you back at Corwin Brothers before you know it. How many times have I got to say it? I'm done with it. Or it's done with me. Either way, my career is over. This is all going to blow over. People are going to forget about some stupid mistake the minute the next celebrity scandal breaks. That mistake was on national TV. Live. In prime time. They're not just going to forget. Yeah, and you shouldn't have been in that competition in the first place. Especially after what happened to your brother. I'm going to smooth things over with the Board at Corwin Brothers. We are going to salvage the book deal, and it's not like they canceled your contract at TNCN. Suspended, sure, but there's always hope. Don't waste your time. I don't want to go anywhere near a kitchen. [suitcase bumping up the stairs] Hi. I'm Laura. Welcome to the Brook's Point Inn. How can I help you? You don't have an elevator? All right then, Mr... Gosling? No relation. Let's get you checked in. So are you in town for the Festival? [smoke alarm beeping] What festival? Is there always smoke billowing out of your kitchen? That's just "Five Alarm Dennings" doing what she does best. Okay, what she does best is going to send us all up in flames. [smoke alarm beeping] Mr... [phone rings] [smoke alarm beeping] Thank you for calling Brook's Point Inn. [smoke alarm beeping] This is Laura speaking. [smoke alarm beeping] [Abby struggling] [smoke alarm beeping] Stupid hunk of junk! Okay that hunk of junk is actually doing its job. [smoke alarm beeping] [beeping stops, smashes to floor] Are you trying to burn the place down? [Abby] Ah, no actually. I'm not. Everything's under control. I'm just doing a little bit of baking here. Whoops! There we go. And, uh... [coughs] Some scones. All under control. I see why they call you Five Alarm Dennings. Hi. I'm so sorry. I don't normally greet guests this way. I'm Abby. I run Brook's Point Inn. I didn't realize smoke inhalation was part of the complimentary service. Next show starts at five. Umm. And you are? Jay. [loud coughing] [Alice laughing] I knew if I followed the smoke, I'd find my granddaughter. Gran? Are you all right? Is everything okay? I was going to ask you the same thing. Ah. Oh, hello dear. I'm Alice. I see you've already met my granddaughter. I'm hoping that our home will suffice for your temporary home away from home. Well, I won't be staying long. Oh, I hope you reconsider. The smoke will clear, dear. It always does. If you'd like to follow me, I can get you settled in. Into one of our non-smoking rooms. How are you? Okay. Are you good? Yup. So. What's up? Weren't you supposed to out with the Cocoon Club this morning? I didn't feel up to it. No? Is everything okay? I'm fine. Eloise's sister had Parkinson's. I'm sure she'd be a wonderful support, if you let her. I'm not ready to tell her yet. I don't want her treating me any differently. You have to stop worrying about me. Now, I've got presents to wrap. And you've got a very handsome gentleman paying attention to you. 'Gentleman'? He barged in here and barked orders at me. Well, it was evident that you needed a little help. And he above all should know his way around a kitchen. And why on earth is that? That was Jason Corwin. Of the Corwin Brothers. A handsome pair they were. You know, they had that fancy restaurant in New York. Well that explains the bloated ego. More like a broken heart. It was a tragedy about his brother. Oh, was he the chef whose brother died in that plane crash? Right. Well, Gran, I don't know if it's such a good idea that I take over for Matilda as chef. I think that you can do anything you set your mind to. But, perhaps this is not your battle. But, perhaps this is not your battle. [laughing] Your Mother was a terrible cook. I mean really awful! And don't even get me started about your Dad. I know they would be so proud of you. You work so hard to make everyone around you happy. But you deserve to be happy too. What? I am happy, Gran. I've got everything I need right in front of me, right here. Right back at you. What are your thoughts on hiring an extra set of hands just one person to help Brad out? Because I know he's run off his feet. He's so busy. He doesn't have enough time to fix everything. Gran, is everything okay? Oh yes. Well... Gran, what is it? Do you need an ambulance? No, it's not that. The Inn's out of money. I've used my personal savings to balance the books for over a year. And I've neglected paying the property taxes for a few years. I wanted to tell you but I really thought I had everything under control. It's okay. It's okay. I'm sure it's not that bad. Oh, it's worse. This is my home. And I can't even imagine living anywhere else. Oh Abby. I am so sorry. I've let us all down. Gran, it's okay. I know. I know this is your home. I... Let me take a look at the books. I'm sure I can shuffle some numbers around. Forty-three thousand dollars is an awful lot of shuffling. Leave it with me. I'll think of something. I promise. Okay? It's okay. [voice message] You have one saved voice message. [beep] [David] Hey! Just about to board. I wanted you to know the meeting went great. They loved our ideas. Man, there's the craziest sunset at the airport. Makes me excited for tomorrow. I'll call you when we land. Oh, great. Nice to see you too. Sorry, I was just hoping to do some thinking on my love seat for a bit. Your love seat? I didn't see your name on it. No not my name but my parents. They used to hang out here quite a bit. This was kind of their spot. Anyway, I don't want to interrupt your cell phone time. So. Plenty of room for two. I'm sorry about your parents. Oh, it happened a long time ago. I wear their wedding rings so I feel closer to them. It's funny the things you hold on to. I always feel so calm here. I bet your lungs do. Five Alarm. [chuckles] I guess I'll never live that one down. Listen, about earlier, I'm sorry for the way things were handled. I know you were just trying to help. I shouldn't have been so rude. I've... Just on edge. It was a long trip. Thanks. So where did you travel from? New York. Okay. And what brings you here? Free will. Just somebody else's. Well lucky you. You're about to fall in love and you don't even know it. Brooks Point Harbour is a really special place. We're a really tight knit community and everybody looks out for everyone here. I don't really get the appeal of small towns. I love big cities. They're alive and busy. Noisy. Well, silence can be just as loud. I suppose. Oh by the way. I actually wanted to mention to you, next week there is a... I'm really not interested in tourist attractions. Okay. Before you leave, though, you have to do yourself a favor and try our diner's BLT. It's so so good. It's to die for. 'Diner' and 'dying'. I can see how they go together. Oh, come on. You live in New York. You're telling me you don't like diners? New York has some of the finest restaurants in the world. Why would I eat at a diner? Because they're not just a fad. Diners have withstood the test of time for a reason. They're steadfast and sturdy. Predictable, uninventive. Wow! Does it make you feel good being such a snob? Snob? I just have a difference of opinion. I've never eaten at a diner, never will. You have never...? Okay. You have to go to a diner. You have to go to ours and try the BLT. It's the best. No, I don't. And how do you know it's the best BLT? I mean, how many diner BLT's have you tried? Okay, easy Mr. Corwin. Corwin? Gosling didn't last long. I guess my days of being undercover are over. You should tilt your nose down once in a while. Otherwise, you'll miss what's going on around you. Or where you're at. Okay, that's not fair. Whatever you've read about me, you have no clue. I'm not assuming anything. You've made quite an impression here on your own already. I'm sorry, I really didn't mean to offend you. Well, you did. Brooks Point Harbour means a lot to the people of this town. You don't get to come here and hide out from whatever terrible things you've done and then judge anything you're not willing to experience yourself. Anyway, I have somewhere I have to be. Take away will be ready in about five. Coffee? Ah, no thanks. I'm running on natural jitters today. The camera adds ten pounds. Even to a mayor. Too bad they didn't come off after the picture. [laughs] I heard you've run into a bit of trouble at the Inn. Matilda's replacement bailing on you? That can't be good for business. It's all under control, Mayor Joan. Thanks. This town's lucky I was able to snag such a prestigious national festival. Yeah, it's wonderful that all the proceeds are going to fund the local after-school programs and the library. A portion of the proceeds, yes. This festival is really going to put Brooks Point Harbour on the map. Tourism is going to skyrocket. Uh, you're telling me. We're hosting the entire TNCN crew at the Inn. Well, you be sure and tell them, if they want an interview with the Mayor, they can have one. Anytime. Order's up, Abby. Hey Joan. Have you seen this? Christmas Chef Showdown. Grand prize of fifty thousand dollars. Nothing to sniff at, huh? They want a mystery competitor, a local amateur cook, to compete against their big name chefs. Amateur? As in no talent required? It is a televised event. Ah, earth to Abby? I could do this. [scoffs and laughs] Five Alarm Dennings... in a cooking contest? [laughs] What, Scorched Sardines again? That fish was flambéed. I don't think so. But if you did participate, having one of our oldest businesses would be great in my advertising. Yes, it would be amazing advertising for the Inn. Plus fifty thousand dollars! You have to win to get that. Thank you. You know what? I'll take two strawberry milkshakes to go, please. Thanks. Do you have to keep playing with that thing? I don't have to, but if I don't fix it, this whole place will burn down. I'll try to be faster. Thank you. [Laura] Strawberry milkshakes! Uh oh. What's going on? Oh, you know. It's Christmas and you two have been doing amazing work lately. And? And I'm hoping you're willing to do a little extra hard work this coming week. So we're not hiring more help? What does extra mean? Just a couple of hours a day. I'm planning on entering the cooking competition in the Festival. [Laura laughs] What? More Charred Cheesecake? No more burnt scones? Very funny. So take a look at this. They're looking for a local contestant. If I'm selected, there will be two other competitors, which means I have really good odds at winning this thing. You know the other two competitors are actual chefs right? Professionals. I know that but they specify that they want local talent. Which means they probably just want some charm and fun, which I will bring. How exactly are you going to learn to cook in a week? Online tutorials, Matilda's cookbooks. I have a kitchen at my disposal. Okay, I know I'm not the best chef in the world. I get a little distracted. But if I have something to focus on, I'll be able to move mountains. Okay, you know I'm all about self-improvement and you becoming less of a fire hazard, but why on earth do you want to do this? We need this fifty thousand dollars. The Inn's in a little bit of trouble. I was speaking with my Grandma who's been trying to balance the books. But it's bad. It's really bad, but if I win this prize money this will at least bring us out of the red. The Inn could actually close? Not if I win this competition. I guess I could help Laura out with the guest services. Seems easy enough. [scoffs] I could help Brad with repairs. Have you ever held a hammer in your life? A hammer? What's a hammer? What's a girl to do? I know, I know. This is a really big ask but I can't do this without you. [Laura] Okay. First up. Name. Abby Dennings. Easy. That's a lot of fine print. "Are you a professional chef?" I'm going to go ahead and click the "no" box on that one. "Are any of your employees or family members employed by The National Cooking Network?" No. No. None of this applies to me. I'm as amateur as they get. What's next? "Application not processed until full payment of entrance fee received." Five hundred dollars? What? Who has five hundred dollars lying around? We could have a bake sale. Sell five hundred burnt scones. No. No. The application deadline is tonight at midnight. I don't have time to burn that many scones. Abby! No! Well, you'd better get to cooking. [knocking on door] I need you to teach me how to cook. I'm not a chef anymore. Are, were, whatever. You still know how to cook. And apparently, I'm also a snob. I know I'm being a little pushy right now. And I'm sorry for the way I spoke to you earlier. Are you actually? A little bit. Look, I'm not asking you to be my friend. I know I really irritate you. But what I am asking for is a teacher. I'm really hoping to enter a cooking competition in the By the Bay Christmas Food Festival next week and... Food Festival? Gary! Oh, come on. You're already bored out of your mind. You've been here for less than a day. You've got to find something to do. It's not going to be you cooking, it's going to be me. And it's not like I need to cook for the president. I just need to learn how to not set things on fire. And not poison anybody. Sorry. It's a steep learning curve. Gary. Yeah, it's your favorite client here. Just wondering why his overpaid lawyer dropped him off in the one place that's hosting a Christmas Food Festival! Call me back. So that's it? Look, it's within your best interest not to be associated with me right now. Is it true? Did you cheat on that cooking competition? It's not a tough question. No one's actually ever asked me that before. My brother's memory was on the line. And I barely even remember making the decision. Do you regret it? Every day. So you made a mistake. People make mistakes all the time. People are allowed to make mistakes. Celebrities are not. Scandals like mine kill careers. I've completely undone everything that David worked so hard for. Wasn't it the 'Corwin Brothers'? David was the charismatic one. I mean, he was the peacemaker. Everybody loved him. He was the teacher, not me. I'm so sorry you lost him. And I know me saying that doesn't make things any easier. Thank you. You know. I've never watched you on TV or been to your restaurant. But I've lost loved ones. You just want to shut down and hide. But that doesn't make things any easier. You can't bring your brother back but you can do everything in your power to continue his legacy. I've been ousted by my own company. I'm completely toxic within the industry. Nobody wants me. I want you. And I'm sure you want another chance to redeem yourself. So you want to hire me? Not exactly hire. Um. I'm not totally flush for cash at the moment, but what I can offer you is undying gratitude and a little chance at some redemption. If I agree to this, you got to know it's going to be long hours. Yes! Yes. I'll do anything. It'll be demanding and stressful. And you'll probably going to hate me even more by the end of this. You mean I'll get an even closer look at the arrogant, egotistical Jason Corwin? He's also a class-A jerk with anti-social tendencies. But as you already know this going in... Yes! Yes! Thank you. This is going to be a lot of hard work. Okay? With no cutting corners. Okay? We need to follow the rules absolutely. Is that understood? Yes, Chef. And we also need to find another kitchen. Away from the Inn. You are far too distracted. If I'm going to teach you, I need your undivided attention. I know just the places. Cheryl's. Behind the cafe, across the street. Okay, we start first thing in the morning. Seven a.m. sharp. Do not be late. I will not be late. You're late. No, I'm two minutes early. You're not even dressed for work. Go and change into something less flirty. I'm wearing a blouse! I have to look half decent to run the Inn. It's not suitable for a kitchen. Go and change into something else. And tie your hair up! Hurry! Or you'll really going to be late by the time you get back. Rude, egotistical... Hey Chef. So, do I pass the inspection now? Excellent. Okay, first things first. What do you have to prep for the competition? There are three different challenges. There are three different challenges. The appetizer, the main course with a side dish, and a dessert. Okay. Are they surprising you with any secret ingredients? No. But the food will revolve around a central theme. But they're not telling us that until we're on stage. Got it. Okay. Let's start with how to prep a plate. Mixing different ingredients, flavors, colors... Yeah? Yup. Number one is going to be knife skills. This... is a Chef's knife. Ohh! I like this one. Put that down! Safety. Always safety Got it. Hold the knife handle in the palm of your hand. Ease it up a little bit. And you want to keep your thumb pressed against the blade. You want to keep the knife on the chopping board. Smooth motions. Okay? Okay. Chef, do you ever think I'll be able to chop air like you do? No. Slow and easy. No rushing. With the curved side down, this hand, you're going to want back here on the celery away from the blade. And then just slow easy movements. Smaller. More uniform pieces. Right right. So it looks nice. No. So it cooks evenly. Chef. Does celery bleed? No. Celery does not bleed. Number two. No short cuts. All these distractions, they can get you really hurt. But cuts do happen. So, number three. Get used to blood. I'm going to get a first aid kit. [breathing heavily] Hey Chef. I think we may have another problem. What now? Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Hmm. It doesn't look deep. No, it's not that deep. You won't need stitches. The antibiotic ointment should help it heal pretty quickly. Just keep it clean and dry. Take care of that finger. You're going to need it in the future. You're the best. Thank you, Cheryl. If you're not going to listen to me, there is no point in me teaching you. I am going to listen. I promise. Whoa! No. Lesson is done for today. We were just getting started. Your head is not in the game. And I need to reevaluate my plan. Study this tonight. The pictures will help you with your technique. Do you have one with Dummies in the title? Dummies? Really? I wouldn't have agreed to help you if I thought that. Aw. Now you got me feeling all warm and fuzzy inside. Or maybe I'm still feeling light-headed. There is a test in the morning. Okay. Well. Fingers crossed... Finger crossed that I don't amputate something tomorrow. That's not funny. [imitates Jason] Rule number four. No laughing in the kitchen. Preparing food for people is not a joke. It's an honor. Why did you become a chef anyway? Be more occupied with yourself, Abby. It takes years of work to be any good under the best of circumstances. If you want a chance at winning this competition, you need to find your purpose. Where's your focus at? Why do you need to win? [indistinct TV sounds as he flips through channels] [TV sounds stop] [jazzy Christmas music playing in background] [Eloise] And that my friends is Euchre. [laughter] [Oscar] That win needs an asterisk. Ladies, enough with the table talk, please. [Eloise] Alice is my oldest friend. We don't table talk, we read each other's minds. That's still cheating. Jason! I was just going to get some fresh air when I heard the snap of cards at the table. You have good hearing. I hear professionals. People who'll do anything to win. Yes. Fueled by tea and cookies. You had me at tea. Really? You're a tea connoisseur like the rest of us? I peg you as an Earl Grey kind of guy. Caffeine anything. I respect that. You were right. I need to focus on what's important. This. This right here is why I need to win the competition. The Inn isn't just my home. It's a cornerstone in our community. And winning that prize money is going to keep it that way. Remember that for tomorrow's lesson. Jason. Join us for a round. You should take my place. I have to make more tea. Can she make tea, Alice? Is that safe? [Abby] Ha ha ha. Jason would love to play. [Alice] Have you played much Euchre? Not much. [banging noise] Hmmm. That's not straight. Sure it is. Hey! You two are still here? I figured I'd help Brad out with a few projects before heading home. She's actually pretty decent with a hammer. How was card night? It was really fun. Oscar lost. As per usual. And Jason Corwin graced us with his presence. That actually doesn't surprise me. I was watching a video. He wasn't always a curmudgeon. [indistinct chatter from video] I feel weird watching this. He doesn't even seem like the same guy. So sad. Well, okay, well. You guys can head home. You've done more than enough work today. Thank you. [Brad] You got it, boss. You want a lift? Yeah. It beats the bus. [kettle whistling] Okay. Knuckles tucked from in... My grand kids are not going to believe I played cards with Jason Corwin. [Oscar] You lost at cards to Jason Corwin. [laughing] Would you be a dear and sign your cookbook for my granddaughter? Alice mentioned you were staying here. Perhaps now is not the best time. Thank you, dear. Well, it's been an absolute pleasure to meet you all. Thank you very much for the game. It's okay to let yourself grieve. It's better to feel the emotion than to try to sweep it away. Once you've felt the loss, you can begin to heal. Once you've felt the loss, you can begin to heal. Thank you, Alice. I just wish I knew how. Lean on your friends. You have more support than you know. So. Is he better than me? Good. Very good. Hey, it was really nice that you played cards with the Cocoon Club last night. Shh. I don't want people knowing I might be a nice guy. Let's just say I'm a card shark who was looking for a win. Sure thing, Mr Card Shark. Smaller slices. Remember, uniform slices. Right. Right. So why did you sneak away so early last night? Okay, the kitchen needs discipline and restraint, not gossip. It's not gossip. I saw you having fun last night. It was nice to see you let your hair down a little bit. Just focus on the work. I'm trying to focus. Would you lighten up? I feel like I'm walking on eggshells here. Sorry, but this isn't the place to get personal. I'm just saying we don't have to spend the day chopping in brooding silence. You know, you can have some conversation with somebody who's trying to be your friend. You said you wanted a teacher, not a friend. Whoa. You played cards with my Grandma last night. I'm sorry, we're friends now. Jason. You're helping me, maybe I can help you a little bit. Abby, enough! [eggs splat] [Abby laughs] Okay, now we are literally both walking on eggshells. Okay, come on. That's so funny You're being all serious, and then you drop a carton. Jason, why are you so hard on yourself? Let's just clean up and move on. [egg splats] What are you doing? You are wound way too tight. You need to let loose a little bit. Stop it! Not until you drop one. On purpose. That is not going to happen. You can't just shut down all the time. It's okay to laugh a little bit when life gets messy. I'm not going to laugh. I'm ticked off. Well that's a lot of anger over some broken eggs. You are the most... It's okay to be angry for a while. Grief is a process, but you can't just... Save it. I know all about grief. Why do you think I'm here when everything that ever meant anything to me is in New York? Because you haven't decided to fight for what you have left. How can I fight for it when signing a cookbook, just seeing a photo of my brother sends me into a tailspin? That makes sense. It brings back memories for you Jason. Yesterday you asked me why I became a chef. It was David's dream. We did everything together. Same schools, same job. I didn't want to do anything else because I knew whatever we did together, we'd be greater. I didn't just lose David, I lost half of myself. Well, if that's true then you still half of yourself left. We can't chose what happens in our lives but we can chose what happens moving forward. Maybe it's time that you find a new path. I don't know who I am without him. You're Jason Corwin. And that's enough. You don't need to figure out everything today. But you can start by being yourself. An imperfect human being like the rest of us. So stew on that. [egg splats] Okay. How did that feel? Better than anger. Yes! Does anyone ever say 'no' to you? A few people have tried. They really don't get too far. All right. What's next? I suppose... Scrambled eggs. Ohhh! Sounds egg-cellent. That's a terrible pun. But I appreciate the egg-ffort. [Abby laughs] Chanelle? What are you doing in Brooks Point Harbour? Jason? Hey! You're the last person I thought I'd see here. A little higher on the left. Okay. What? I work for TNCN now. They're the festival sponsor. Roger sent me down to do set up and to ensure the town was 'acceptable' for his stay. You know how demanding he is. Oh that's generous. I call it 'difficult' or 'belligerent' or 'ego without the talent to back it up'. Well, off the record. He's even worse after his promotion. He got another promotion? Well, after the competition ratings went through the roof, TNCN hired him as their full time inhouse Executive Producer. Ego or not, I don't know how he does it. He's so busy with the Corwin Brothers too. Yeah. Poor Roger. Right. Well. I got a lot of Roger's details to take care of. It was nice seeing you. [phone rings] How's my favorite client? Did you set me up? Putting me in the same town as Roger? Jason, look, I knew about the Festival, but I didn't know that he was running it. Although, this could be a good opportunity for you. Do you hear what you just said? He's no longer my rival. He's just moved straight on into enemy. I'm getting the first flight out of here. I'm not even sure what I would do if I bumped into him. Jason you're going to run into him at some point in your career. You might as well deal with it now. Listen. The Board of Directors called. They are warming to the idea of you returning to the company. They're not happy with Roger's decision to move into frozen produce. Of course they're not. He doesn't know the first thing about how to run a culinary company. All he cares about is the bottom line. [Alice] I'm not going to sell to some big chain that has no understanding of the concept of personal service. Besides, I'm not going to have to sell at all. Abby is going to win the money and pay off our debts. Abby can barely boil water. She only has a chance of getting chosen because she's a pretty local with a historical cause. Plus she'll be against top chefs. I believe in her! You need to think about what's best for the future. If I get you a substantial offer, you could live comfortably the rest of your life. [Alice laughs] You're impossible. So are you. Abby. Mayor Joan. I hope to get that water boiling technique on lock down. I'm sure you will. Gran, I'm sorry you had to listen to that nonsense. I'm afraid she has a point. The bank is not going to wait forever before they foreclose. No no no no. Gran, Gran, please don't sell just yet. The ads at the Festival are going to bring in more guests. Plus my practicing has been going really well. Look at these cookies. They're not burnt. Not even one of them. I believe you can win. But the fact is, if you don't, I'll have no other choice but to sell. [knocking at door] Come in. Abby, I, um... [Abby sniffling] Is everything okay? Oh yeah. Yeah. I'm just practicing outside of school hours, Chef. Cutting onions. Burning onions, more like it. The pan is way too hot. You might as well just throw it out and start again. Right. I forgot. Medium low heat for carmelization, right? Right. Hey, do you want a glass? I think I have something other than Chardonnay. Is that code for me being a wine snob? No, it's actually code for "I'm going to finish this bottle myself, so let me get you another." I may not know the difference between my kale and my collards, but I take my wine very seriously. Cheers. Cheers. Come on in. I see you have all the big names out tonight. It's good that you're doing the research. [Abby sighs] Abby you're not cutting onions anymore. What's up? I told you finances were tight. They're not. They're dire. If I don't win this competition my Grandma's going to have to sell the Inn to one of those big chain motels in town. That's a lot of pressure to put on yourself. And that's just the half of it. You know, if she has to sell I'll lose my job. We won't have this place anymore. My Grandma's in the early stages of Parkinson's. And this is her last connection to my parents. And my Grandpa too. So, it's just really important for her mental health that she stay in the Inn. Why do you... You keep doing that. Where's your necklace? I used the rings to raise the entrance fee for the competition. So if I lose, the rings are gone too. I'm so sorry. You don't need to, you don't need to hear any of this. I'm just blubbering all over you. How about that. Dinner and a show. [Abby chuckles] Listen to you, working on that sense of humor. Let's give dinner another try. Okay, it will be great for distraction management. The key is to breathe. Quiet the mind. The competition is going to be chaotic and noisy. So you might as well get used to it. Should I get some wooden spoons and pots and pans for your enjoyment? I'll be hands off. I swear. Okay. Not bad. I'm sorry. It definitely could've used a lot more cheese. No apologies, no excuses. Whatever you put in front of someone is your masterpiece. Be proud of it. Don't give them a reason to criticize it. If they come up with their own, then fine. Okay Chef, honest opinion. What did you think of this masterpiece? The pasta could have used two more minutes but other than that, it was pretty good. You mean it? Yeah. I do. I have a question for you, about your competition. How did you get disqualified? Was it store-bought chicken broth? It's a little more complex than that. My popovers didn't rise two minutes before the buzzer went off. And my sous chef offered his rosemary potatoes. Marcus later denied that he offered them to me and that he played any part in it. I was publicly shamed, and he got his own TV show. That doesn't seem right. I shouldn't have been in the competition anyway. I was not in a good place after my brother died, but Roger persuaded me to do it to honor David's memory. Were you and Roger close? Not ever. He likes to get under my skin. At the funeral, he said it's a shame, and I quote 'the more talented brother died'. Well I never had the pleasure of knowing David, but I think Jason Corwin's pretty great. Well, I should get going. Seven a.m. sharp tomorrow. Crash course on main courses. I feel like I've been doing a lot more crash than course lately. A lot less crash every day. I'm here to make sure of that. You need to make sure you save the Inn. Keep tomorrow night open. For a field trip. I think you and I could use some fresh air after all this smoke inhalation that's been going on. Good. We can talk about any surprises TNCN might throw at you during the competition. Actually, I was hoping to maybe have a few hours where we just don't talk about the competition. Field trip it is. Great. I'll pick you up at eight.

Your heart needs to be in the garden to make it flourish. You know, Abby has a beautiful light. Carrots. I just want carrots. [crunches] [clomping on stairs, indistinct chattering] Looks like the TNCN crew has arrived. I'm going to let Laura check them in so I can keep practicing. Want to join? I've actually got some errands to run. Okay. But I'll catch you later? Yeah. Sure. I need you out there. The rooms are ready to go, but I'm not sure they're checking in. What? [Abby] Whatever the guests want, they get. We have to make sure everybody's happy. Matilda's RV broke down and she won't be back for a few days. Matilda's RV broke down and she won't be back for a few days. Okay, we'll need to order us some meal vouchers for everybody until she gets back. [Roger] Hmmm. Meal vouchers. For that Diner? Is this some kind of joke? Merry Christmas! My name's Abby Dennings. I'm the Manager here at Brook's Point Inn. You are the mystery cook on our Christmas Chef Showdown. What? Did I get selected? -You haven't heard? -No. Somebody from my team was supposed to contact Joan and then Joan was supposed to contact you. And somewhere it must have fallen through the cracks. But congratulations, you have been selected. Thank you! Thank you so much! I'm Roger Evans, VP of Communications and Executive Producer at The National Cooking Network. Well it's so lovely to meet you, Mr Evans. We're so excited to have you here. I'm sure you are now. I only agreed to these accommodations because I was told they include breakfast and dinner here at the Inn. Now, I'm having a very important client to wine and dine with, tonight. And if that kitchen is not running, I will be more than happy to find somewhere else to stay. And I'm taking the entire crew with me. You know what? That won't be necessary. Our Chef has just had a slight delay outside of town but she'll be... Abby has hired an even better Chef. [quietly] Laura. Excellent. Problem solved. Mr Evans, wait. I've been waiting for too long, Ms Dennings. Now are you able to provide dinner or not? Yes. Yes. We'll have dinner ready for you at seven o'clock tonight. Well then. It looks as if I'm checking in after all. Wonderful. Is there anyone to pick up my luggage? Oh! Absolutely. Laura, why did you say that? I panicked. We couldn't let them leave All right. Stay here and check in the rest of our guests. And I have to go prep dinner service. Do you want me to call Jason? No. No. I got this. Welcome to the Brook's Point Inn. Jason. Hello. It's gotten a lot quieter up here. Yeah. Ever since the TNCN crew got settled in, things really settled down. Where's Abby? [smashing sound] I'll give you one guess. Abby! What's going on? Sorry, but I tried to... Abby. No buts. It's like everything I taught you over the week has just disappeared into thin air. Jason, that's not true. I'm just trying to... Jason! Jason. Put me down. I have to cook dinner. Take a breath. What's going on? Matilda isn't back. But Roger Evans is here, and he's here with his entire crew. And he's threatening to leave if I don't have dinner ready for them tonight. Take a breath! The festival's a few days away. And I thought I had this whole cooking thing in the bag. But then I got here and I panicked. And there's no way I'm going to win that Festival. And my Grandma's going to have to sell this Inn, and it's... [deep breaths] I needed to breathe. [Jason chuckles] Why didn't you just call me? Because you don't work here. And honestly, I didn't know if you'd come. After everything we've been through this week, you think I'd abandon you now? Abby, you're the only reason I'm still here. Jason, I wanted your help, but I... You don't think I'm ready for the kitchen? I don't think that. But I don't know if you think that. Ever since Cheryl's produce, my brain has not been able to stop creating new dishes. David and I always wanted to cook farm to table. I'm finally excited about being back in the kitchen again. Really? Do you have any new ideas? Lots. And especially since I met you. Take this. Every chef needs one. It's amazing. It's official. No. [they both laugh] Jason, I don't know what to say. Well, that is a first. How long do you cook Chicken Supreme? Until it's done? There she is. Go get changed. And grab some disposable gloves. I'm going to teach you the rules of poultry. It's going to get messy. Thank you.

You should be proud of yourself. Wow. This is a little weird. I kind of miss you yelling at me. [chuckles] I never yelled at you. Okay, but you wanted to, though. Wanting to is very different. You've done wonders for my patience. You were right. I didn't think I was ready to step back into dinner service. But I actually had a lot of fun. It wasn't just David's dream. I wanted this. If it wasn't for you, I never would have found my way back to the kitchen. I can fill in for Matilda until she comes back. That way we can carry on doing this and you can keep on training. Really? No. No. I'm so grateful for everything you've done, but I can't afford to hire a Michelin star chef. [coins jingle] There. Now you've paid me. We're even. It was worth every penny. [Roger clears his throat] Pardon me. I didn't mean to interrupt. -Hello, Roger. -Jason. You're working here? What a... surprise. No, Jason doesn't work here. Everyone's wondering where you've been. And here you are. Well. Thank you both for a delightful dinner. Abby, I'll have Chanelle drop off your signed contract at the front desk. Although I'm not entirely certain I'll be proceeding with the competition. What? I need this. Steve Arnesen has pneumonia which leaves me with Clara Tasker and you. Now I need a professional second chef for my audience. I need 'Wow'. You're local color. And I know you hate every single project I do. But you are back in the kitchen, aren't you. Jason would love to step in. Done. Tomorrow. Two o'clock. Okay, I know I shouldn't have jumped in, but this will give you a chance to clear your name. Abby, I don't want to compete against you. You need to win this prize money. Jason, you are at your happiest when you are cooking in a kitchen. You belong on that stage. Do this for you. [Jason] Keep going straight. Okay and turn right. [Abby] Okay. Keep going. -We almost there? -Nearly. Okay, now sit to your left. -No peeking. -I'm not. And... open your eyes. So, what can I get for you guys today? Two BLT's on rye, please Gayle. [Gayle] Sure. What? 'The' Jason Corwin in a diner? Well, I hear the BLT's are 'to die for'. I also hear Gayle got some of your famous Christmas Pudding. Easy. You're not getting that recipe. It's a family secret. [Jason's phone buzzes] It's Gary. It's not important. It's seems important. It's seems important. I need to focus. Breathe. So we got two BLT's on rye, and two strawberry shakes. On the house. And the famous pudding. The one dish you always make perfectly. Come on, Gayle. You know you're not getting that recipe either. It's a family secret. Well, I will not stop trying. New York. You miss it. Less now. I don't have the same drive that I used to. Oh, I don't believe that. You come alive when you're in the kitchen. For right now, I want to be here with you. And trying this world-renowned BLT. Unbelievable. [they both laugh] Abby! Gran, what happened? I tripped on the area rug in my room. And I knocked my head on the table by the door. Were you feeling dizzy again? No, Abby. I just tripped. It's nothing to fuss about. We don't know that! We don't know. Abby! Gran, I need you to be okay. And I am okay. Abby, really. Dr Murray insisted I get rid of that loose area rug. And he made me promise to reduce my stress. But there is one thing I would like to get off my chest. I've been diagnosed with Parkinson's. My symptoms aren't severe at the moment, but I haven't felt comfortable leaving the Inn for a few weeks. I didn't tell you because I didn't want you treating me any differently. And Oscar, I'm still going to beat you at Euchre. Badly. I know you will, Alice. I know you will. We'll face whatever's coming together. As we always have. Uh huh. Absolutely. [Abby] I think he still really struggles. But you should see him in the kitchen. He's so confident. He knows exactly what he's doing. He's so passionate. Honestly, it's hard to focus on the chicken. [laughs] Abby! You like him. No. He's just... He'll have to go back to his life eventually. Falafel for my lady! Oh! There you go. Oh, let me get you a napkin for the tahini sauce. Okay. You and Brad, though. I know. Our resident handyman is actually quite the gentleman. [Abby laughs] Well, as unofficial matchmaker, I need a bite of this falafel. Last week you wanted me to stay, now you want me to come home. [Jason] What's changed? Roger's frozen line is hurting the brand. The Board wants you back on as Chairman. What if I don't want it? You said you were cooking again. Yeah, and enjoying it for the first time in forever. I mean, yesterday I made a Beef Wellington and enjoyed every moment of it. Why would I want to go back to everything that made me so miserable? Roger is hocking discounted frozen foods, made with the cheapest ingredients he can find, from who knows what sources, under your name. That can't sit right with you, Jason. Of course it doesn't. Well then you need to head up your own company. [Jason] Email me their proposal. I bumped into Roger. Long story short, I'm in the TNCN Competition. What? Arnesen pulled out. They needed a replacement. I'm here. It was last minute. I mean, it seems legit. Just be careful. I know. Abby Dennings. Table for one? Well look who it is. What are you doing by yourself? The two lovebirds are over there by the pie table. Laura and Brad? Nice! How about a date at the crepe table with a scandal-ridden, moody ex-chef? I'm okay with scandal-ridden and moody. But what kind of crepes are we talking about? Lady's choice. Whipped cream. -That's your choice? -Uh huh. Okay. Forget it. Date's off. What? Why? You could have fresh berries, cured ham, jams, and you choose whipped cream? You have the palate of a six year old. Six year olds know what's up. Shall we? [indistinct chattering] Oh! There are so many people here right now! The whole town is behind you. A very charming, Michelin Star chef is also rooting for you. Okay. I'm ready when you are. Ready. Gran! Eloise! Are you sure you're up for this? You've had such a long day already. Okay. Either you want me to get out more, or you don't. But don't go changing your mind on me. I get confused enough these days as it is. I'm sorry. -We love you! -I love you! Thank you. Go get 'em! Thank you. We're going to go get our seats. Okay. Okay. Bye. Bye. Hi! I'm, I'm Abby Dennings. I'm the mystery contestant. I'm, just, I'm a huge fan of yours. It's nice to meet you. So how long have you been cooking for? Oh you know... couple weeks. Good luck. I don't know if I can do this. Yes you can. Win or lose, you're going to do it spectacularly. There is no shame in that. Remember, when you're out there, it is just you and the ingredients. Nothing else matters. Focus. No short cuts. You're going to be great. Thank you. Thank you. All right everyone. All right everyone. Cameras roll in just a moment. I need enthusiasm. I need applause. I need smiles. And... Action! [clapping, cheering] Welcome to A Christmas Chef Showdown. I would like to introduce you to our Emcee for this competition. Marcus Aiken. Come here. [clapping, cheering] Thank you! Thank you! Welcome to the TNCN Christmas Chef Showdown, where two of the best chefs in the country and one mystery cook... Marcus was my sous chef. You mean the one who forgot to have your back? Yeah, but if it wasn't for him, I'd still be in New York. Lonely and miserable. If anything, I owe him. You'll be making an appetizer, a main dish with a side and a dessert. Each dish will receive a maximum of ten points. After the third course, the chef with the highest point tally will win $50,000! [clapping, cheering] Now please give a warm welcome to our contestants. Clara Tasker, Head Chef at Bisou in Chicago. [clapping, cheering] Jason Corwin of Corwin Brothers in Manhattan. Welcome Jason! [clapping, cheering] And now. It's time to meet our mystery cook. Brooks Point Harbour's very own... Abby Dennings! [clapping, cheering] Ms Dennings manages the Brook's Point Inn right here in town. Chefs, you must be dying to know this competition's theme? Whether it's around a big table or leftovers the next day, this food is delicious and irresistible. Comforting, hearty, delicious. Your theme is 'Family Christmas'. Ho ho ho! [clapping, cheering] Contestants, you have sixty minutes to create a festive appetizer that your family would love. Good luck to each of you. Your sixty minutes starts... Now! [bell rings] I am focused. [gags] I feel ill. Shortcuts - no. Distraction management - yes. Come on Abby. Come on Abby.

Just a few more seconds and his spectacular pork tenderloin would have made it to the judges. But it did not. The judges award you four points. Ms Dennings, your roasted brussel sprouts was refreshing. Eight points. Chef Tasker, your perfectly seasoned turkey gave you the edge. You win this round with nine points. [clapping and cheering] Chef Corwin. I'm sorry. Your Family Christmas is done. Thank you for having me in your kitchen, Chef Aiken. An executive chef versus an aspiring cook. Who will win? It's anyone's guess. [clapping and cheering] And... Cut! Let's take a break. Thank you very much. [Eloise] Eat some of the gingerbread cookies. They're snowmen! Wave to my grand kids. [giggling] I'm filming all this so they see... Abby! Great work out there. Thanks. Jason was instrumental in helping me prepare for the competition. I bet. He's a master of flavor and texture. I miss working with him. You should speak with him. I know. Marcus. Would you excuse us? Nice chatting with you. You're doing wonderfully in this competition. Actually, far beyond my expectations. Thank you? There's one little detail that's kind of bothering me though. When you signed the contract, you stated that you never hired anyone from TNCN. And yet, that's not entirely true, right? Yes it is. You paid Jason to cook for your guests. I saw it with my own eyes. Are you talking about that pocket change thing? Because that was a total joke. And besides, Jason doesn't work for TNCN anymore. You canceled his show. On air or not, he's still under contract. Which, for you my dear, constitutes a violation of contract. Roger. I have to compete in this competition. Oh, no no. I'm not kicking you out of the competition. However, I need Clara to win. You see, we need new on-air talent. And she's a star. But if she doesn't win, I cannot give her a show now, can I? So let me get this straight. You want me to lose on purpose? Or what? You'll expose me on national TV due to some clerical error? Do you really think that Jason can withstand another scandal? Because that is exactly what's going to happen if his involvement came to light. Jason had nothing to do with this. I was the one who signed that contract. It doesn't matter. I will make the public believe what I want them to believe. that Jason never sets food in a professional kitchen again. And you'd stay CEO of Corwin Brothers. This is disgusting. This is business Abby. I am looking forward to seeing your dessert, Ms Dennings. [clapping] Welcome back. It's time for our final challenge.

[cheering and clapping] I won. I won! I won! Thank you! Thank you so much. I won! Wow. Our home cook beats two top chefs. Unbelievable. Tell us about your winning dessert. I can't believe this. Um... Thank you. Thank you so much. Um... To be honest, I lucked out with the Christmas theme and I made my Grandma's Christmas Mini Puddings. My family has enjoyed this recipe for generations. I never fail at making this recipe because I always take the time to make it exactly the way my Grandma does. Because we always make it together. I love you Gran. [laughing and clapping] Any plans for the $50,000? Yes. I plan to save our home. The historic Brooks Point Inn. [clapping and cheering] Okay. Cut! Abby. Backstage. Right now. Sure. Yeah. Um. Here Marcus. Thanks. Sure. Did you really think I wasn't serious? That I wouldn't destroy him? I'm sending that press release. Oh, Roger. What? Well that's a myth. My friend Eloise just bought a new SD card. She likes to take a lot of videos. And she just sent me this. Of you threatening me. "Look, I know it's bogus, you know it's bogus. But do you think Jason can withstand another scandal? Because that is exactly what's going to happen if his involvement came to light." [indistinct chattering from video on phone] [Abby crunching] Mmm. Chips. Crisps. Wish I had pudding. [Jason] Roger really is a piece of work. I'm sorry he did that to you. [Jason's cell phone buzzes] Marcus. Hey Jason. It was good to see you back in the kitchen. It was good to see you too. Jason. I'm sorry. I never had the guts to tell you the truth. Your popovers didn't rise because I replaced the all purpose flour with pastry flour. You what? I sabotaged you, then I suggested you use what I cooked. I appreciate you telling me that. You're a good man and a great chef, Jason. I've never met anyone with more integrity than you. Everyone knew your head wasn't in the game. That only made it easier for Roger. It was Roger's idea? He can read people. He saw I was ambitious and he promised me my own show if I did what he wanted. It was me who forgot the rules. I appreciate you telling me but I have to take responsibility for my own plate. I'm so sorry, Jason. I have no right to expect your forgiveness. Thank you. Pass it back. There you go. Thank you. [smoke alarm goes off] You've got to be kidding me. This is a cruel Christmas joke. [smoke alarm beeping loudly] Jason? Really? Well I thought I'd make it like the first time we met. Yeah except there was a lot more smoke in here. Hi, I am Jason Corwin, your new head chef. Really? You're moving here? Well, I don't know. We have very high standards here at Corwin Brothers. Well, I promise to work towards one more star. Boss. Best Christmas ever. You got your parents' rings back. I did. Just in time for Christmas. I know we still have one more day, but I ran into Santa and he told me to give you this. So does this mean that Santa likes to cook? Of course. How else would he get Mrs Claus to say 'yes'? This book has inspired many great cooks. Many great cooks is right. Thank you. So we don't normally exchange gifts until Christmas morning. But, Gran wanted me to give you these. [laughs] Euchre! I've been practicing with Oscar. I love you. I love you too. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.
