A light existed in the corner Of the room. A small, yellow triangle of light. Her eyes caught it, held it. Magic they were, golden and devouring. A decade ago, I was their willing prisoner. A lock held my heart. Chained. Chained. Chained me to her. And when, at last, I broke free, I realized the meters and miles, how far I'd come in the wrong direction and how much further I needed to go to ever find her again. Ha! Ah. Right here. Good. Here. Good. Now you can poise up. I really want you to go deeper now. Good. Right through here. Pull you up. Good. Feel your body. Good. And send this energy out to each other. Let it mix in the room and send through each other. Good. Make some sound. Good. You got to make sound. A little more right here. Good. Good. Good. Good. And right here. A teeny little bit back here. Come on. Come on. Deeper. Go deeper. Okay. Uh, keep working that head. Okay? Good. Good. Into each other. Come on. We're gonna have a good day. Good. Good. Bring it back here. Excellent. Excellent. A light existed in the corner of the room. A small, yellow triangle of light. Her eyes caught it, held it. Magic they were, golden and devouring. A decade ago, I was their willing prisoner. A lock held my heart. Chained. Chained. Chained me to her. And when, at last, I broke free, I realized the meters and miles, how far I'd come in the wrong direction and how much further I needed to go to ever find her again. And what does it mean? I don't know. Well, what does it mean to you? Love? Lost love? Are you asking me? Because if you're asking me, then you obviously don't know. And if you don't know, then why are you here? You need to know Victor. You need to learn him. You need to understand his wants, his needs. You need to understand where he's been and where he's going. James, we've been working on this monologue for about three weeks, maybe. And to be honest with you, we haven't gotten that far. So, what do I need to do? I can only answer that question so many times. You need to ask yourself. You need to find the girl with the golden eyes, whomever she may be, to you. To Victor. Maybe I'm not meant to do this. Maybe not. All I know is you came to my class for a reason. I'm willing to teach you, but at some point, you have to be willing to try. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. Just do the work. Okay. It's 10 to 4:00. How about we call it a wrap? I'll give you 10 minutes at the end of next session. You want a cup of coffee? Sure. Okay. Come on. Aah! You will look amazing. Why not? Hello. Hi! What is all this? Oh, this is heavy. I'm cooking for you. Here. Where's Sylvia? Serafina. Oh, serafina. Hello. Hi. Hola. Hey. How are you? Fine. You? Oh, so you think? Good, good, good. Can I help something? To cook? Do you cook? Of course I cook. Here. Oh, thank you! They're so beautiful. Can I get you ladies some wine? Uh, me too. Hey. Brit? Hey. What are you doing? Why is your dad here? Look, I don't want to talk about it. You can't tell me that right now when you're in the middle of moving out. If not now, when are we gonna talk about it? James, come on, okay? Don't start this right now. Is it because I quit my job? James, go figure yourself out, okay? 'Cause I-I can't do this anymore. Yeah, I'll be down in a sec. So, is this it? I'll never see you again? You've always owned my heart. I think you know that. The lips. The breath. Eyes. Close. Open. Death is the still water... At the door. I see you, death! I... see... you! You want another glass? Yeah. Sure. What is that? Uh, it's this play i'm working on for my class. What class? Acting class. Oh, what? You're an actor now? The whole law thing just didn't work out for you? Yeah. No, I have no idea what i'm doing, actually. Look, I'm off in 20 minutes. Let's... have a drink. Okay. Muchos gracias, señor. Thank you very much. Hi, Henry. Hi. So, what do you think? Really quite something. Don't give me that. We thought it was great. Tell me honestly. I can take it. No, you can't, Henry. You never could. How dare you? It was... A bit self-indulgent. Self-indulgent? Yeah. Well, thank you. That really means a lot coming from you. After all, that is your area of expertise, isn't it? See? I told you? It's okay. He couldn't take it. Why'd you even bother coming? You asked me to, hen. You asked me to. What do you expect me to say? It was a three-hour one-man show without an intermission. It's barely over two. A man needs to get up and stretch, especially after those cramped, little seats. Well, not everyone can debut their play on Broadway, you know. I'm sorry. I knew it. Knew what? That you'd complain about the theater, about the lack of grandeur. Look, let's not go into this right now, okay? It's a lovely evening. I want to enjoy it. I've got Veronica all dressed up, and I want to show her off a little bit, huh? Fine. He's proud of you. Enjoy the rest of your evening. Seriously, this quarter-life crisis seems a little more dramatic than most. I don't want to be a lawyer anymore. Why does everyone have such a huge problem with that one? It's my life. I'm living it. If I'm not doing what makes me happy, then what's the point? You don't really seem that happy to me. So, okay, so tell me about this acting thing. Like, what is it you're drawn to? 'Cause if you're gonna pursue this, then you should really go whole hog, you know? Who says "whole hog"? Shut up. I know. It's this roadblock, and I can't tap into it. If I can't connect to this one character, then how can I connect to any other one? I don't get it. Maybe I should go to Spain. What? I'm so confused. Go learn Victor. You're really drunk. This play, the one I was telling you about, it's set in Spain. I've never been there. How can one understand the experience of Spain if one has never been there? Brit's gone. This place is really awful without her. Go to Spain, then. Maybe they have hogs there. You're so weird. Think I'm going to bed. All right, don't be an asshole. Go make up. You're a peach, you know that? I try. To peaches. To peaches. Like you. You okay? I just don't know why it went wrong there. There's a point in life where the problems of the son are no longer the fault of the father. Some answers. Nope. Veronica. I was wondering, what am I doing? Why am I here? Why am I learning all of this stuff and giving all of these feelings every minute, every day, every hour, every month, every week? Why am I doing all of this? For what? For this? For a 30-second cola commercial? And I realized I needed to reexamine everything in my life. Everything. And I knew that I was doing this, I was learning all of this and I was doing all of this because I had to. Had. Had to. There was something inside of me... Me. Me. that had to be explored. I had to know my truth. And acting had become my truth. So I can't tell you what to do or how to do it. I can only tell you that you must find this for yourself. You must, must, must, must find your truth. There's only one. It's yours. Okay. It's true. So, who's my next victim? Oh, good. La amar. La amar estaba Serena. Serena estaba la amar. If she could sleep underwater, she would, because then she would never have to leave the sea. "My home," she said. Sand on skin and sun-stained eyelashes, her brown arms wrapped around me, entangle me. What languages did you study In school? German. Aha. I see. No romance languages. Why? La amar. Say it with me. Feel it on your tongue. La amar. La amar. La amar. La amar. La... la amard. I mean, there's a difference. Can you hear it? Lamare. La amar. Right? You can't say these lines kind of like an indifferent American. You have to say them like you know them, like they're yours. La amar. La amar. La amar. La amar. La amar. Okay, practice it. Just... La amar. La amar. La amar. Practice it. I bought my ticket. What? I'm going to Spain on Tuesday. You surprise me. Yeah? I think that you'll, um, open yourself up. And then when you come back, we can maybe conquer Victor. Do you want me to continue? Ah, yeah. No, no, no. No, no, no. Take it from the top. And this time, hit your "r." The heat, frozen hot. The "tomah-toes" are sliced. The "tomay-toes." I never tried to. I never even tried. What? The tomatoes. Yeah? Nothing. It's, um, you know, it's just asides. Just... just say them. It'll... it'll all make more sense when you read the whole play. The whole play? Rather large. Okay, good. Thanks, guys. I think that's all I need to see for... for now, so thanks very much. Thanks. Um, so, who's next? Um... Ana. Ana? Sí. Yo. And Roberto. Roberto? That's me. Okay. So, can we go from the top, please? When you're ready. Okay. Do you think the world gets small at night? Do you think the lights in my room are real? I ache before waking. I fear the morning to losing you. My dreams, only if they continue, light beyond light. The heat, frozen hot. Oh, señor lucchesi. Hola, Francis. How's it going? Oh, just picking something up for the little lady. Oh, did she like the books of monologues? She did. She's been channeling Elizabeth Taylor all over the living room for days. Oh, good. "Cat on a hot tin roof," huh? All the actors seem to go through that these days. Ah, yes, indeed. Did you happen to get a copy of that, uh, splinters play in yet? Oh, no. Not yet. Sorry. Maybe next time. Sure. Have a nice day. May I ask you something? Yeah. How long do you intend to follow me? Uh, I'm... do I know you? No. No, you don't, sir. Well, um, care for a drink? Don't just stand there with your mouth open, kid. This way. So, what do they call you? James. My name's, uh, Carl. Proper. Around here, they all call me Carlo. It's an honor to meet you, sir. You okay, kid? You look a little pale. It's just that, uh, do you believe in fate? I believe in the idea of fate, uh, the hope of fate. I-I don't know if I believe in fate itself. Because your plays are what brought me here. I see. You're a stalker. No, no. I swear, seriously. I can't believe my luck. So, you're a... you're a writer? No, I'm a lawyer. Uh, I was a lawyer. I'm an actor now, I guess. Let me get this straight. You... you were a lawyer, but you gave that up to become an actor? Yeah. Well, I guess everyone needs a fallback plan. True. I've wanted to be an actor since I was a kid. I was just too afraid to admit it to anyone else, too afraid to try. So I became a lawyer. And everyone was happy but me. Takes guts to do something crazy. I know that one. And now that I'm brave enough to try acting, I'm realizing that I'm really an awful actor. I'm stuck. I... I can't connect to any character. It's like... I see the words, but I don't know how to make them real. So you came to Spain to make them real? Make Victor real. Ah, I see. I see. Victor. Yeah. Yeah, I came in search of Victor. Instead you found me. Which, in some ways, is better, because maybe I can ask you what it all means. "A light exists in a corner of a room. A small, yellow triangle of light." Don't. Don't quote "tinto" to me, please. Why not? Do you know how many mediocre college performances of that play that I've had to sit through? How many soggy, washed up, pathetic professors have sought me out over the years to... to glean my secrets and how to write "the play." Do you think I know? Who is she? What do you mean? The girl with the golden eyes. She's in every play you write. I mean, I've only read the old ones. I haven't read the new ones. There are no new ones. Do you know what it's like to have created your... your best work 30 years ago, how paralyzing it is, how to know that you shouldn't even attempt to try to write again 'cause there's no point? You've tried. You can't re-create it, any of it. Do you think I could just tap into it magically, you know? Re-create it instantly, like that? Don't you think I've tried already? So don't you sit over there asking me about this elusive mystery, this golden-eyed girl. Truth is, she doesn't exist. Never did. I made her up, just like I made up everything else. So, where you staying? Uh, some hotel I found. The adagio, I think. Look, we don't want you staying in some old hotel when we have plenty of room. It's just down the road a piece. Come with me, have a drink. Veronica will like you, I think. Hola. What? Can I ask you something? Look... If you don't understand the lines, I don't really want to hear it. It's... it's all in the script. It all makes sense if you read the script. No. I was thinking that if you need help with costumes, I like to do that. Ooh. I-I didn't want to seem... I mean, I will still offer to do the costumes even if I don't get the role. Okay. Ana. It's Ana, no? Sí. What did you have in mind? I may need to read the script first. The whole thing? The whole thing. May I invite you for a drink? It seems you need one. Yeah. Okay. Let's go. Okay. Just down the road, eh? So I lied a little bit. Not a bad drive, though, huh? Not a bad drive at all. Veronica! Veronica! I picked up a wandering Minstrel. So I see. This is James of California. Nice to meet you, James of California. Mucho gusto. Not that I can tell. Nice place. I didn't have much to do with it. So, uh, what do you feel like drinking? I'm game for anything. I have rehearsals tonight, so I should probably get going. Nice to meet you. See you later. Sure. Good. Ciao. Do you like vodka? Sure. Why not? Ah. Let's see now. Do we have any limes? Your daughter's very beautiful. What? She ain't my daughter. Yeah, I know. She's quite a catch. The thing is, uh, she caught me. Um, I'm sorry. I mean... Don't worry. To your health. To my health. To fate. Carlo! Carlo! Hi. Hi. Hey. Hey. Carlo. To bed? To bed? It's early, darling. Let me help you to bed. No, no, no. Let me help you. Come up. Wait, wait. Oh, my gosh. Good night, my boy. Veronica, can you help me up... Up the stairs? Sí. Sí. Thanks. Oh, my god. Wow. Wow. So, you're an actress? And you? Are you an actor, too? Uh, I'm pretending to be an actor, but... Who knows? How do you know Carlo? I don't. What? Oh, we just met this afternoon, uh, at the theater book store. And he brought you home? Wow. He must like you. Tell me, James. What brings you to Spain? Your husband's plays. Oh, no. He's not my husband. That is not my choice, you know? What have you boys been doing this evening? He's a lucky man. No. I am the lucky one. Are you always this bold? You are quite stunning. Why are you here? To figure out what this is all about. This magical life in Spain that inspired your hu... This life that inspired him to write so many amazing plays. And the women, too. The women who inspired it. Well, he's never written anything about me. So there's no need to get to know me better for that reason. Why not? Why wouldn't he write about you? I don't know. You snagged yourself a good one, didn't you? This house is spectacular. How dare you say that? I didn't mean to offend you. Well, you have offended me very much. This is my house. It was my grandfather's. I inherited it when my father died. I see you. I see what you're thinking. And how dare you judge me or judge him? He had nothing when I met him. His plays were all successful. That is true. But any money he had back then all went to Katherine. And when they split, she got almost everything. So don't you think for one minute that I am with him in some kind of like... what do you say? A gold digger? I love him. I don't know why I always have to defend that point. I'm sorry, really. No, listen. I love him. I pursued him. He sees the world in such a magical way. I just love being close to him. He makes me feel alive like no one ever had. I think I'm going to bed. Look, I can leave if you want me to. No! No. He wants you to stay, so you should stay. I want him happy. Your... your room is upstairs. Good night. Morning to you. Coffee. Thank you. You're welcome. Look, um... I think I was a bit drunk last night. So, you didn't mean it when you asked me to marry you? What? Right after you serenaded me. I'm sorry. I said yes, by the way. Whoo! We're gonna be heading out. You think you can find your way back? Yeah, I'll be okay. Thanks. Okay. You sure you won't be bored? Hi. I want you back, brit. And I want you to... Be in my life. I miss you so much. I see she has seduced you, eh? When'd you return? Late. I don't even know. I walked around for hours. You look awful. I feel awful. I called brit. Ah, la californiana. Sí. And? I miss her. I really miss her. So she didn't take you back with a phone call, huh? What'd you expect? You know who she is, don't you, son? Who? The one you let get away. What do I do? Well, you have a couple of choices, kid. Uh, you can do as I did and pathetically write about it for 40 years. Or "b"... What's "b"? Get the hell out of here. Go on. Find her. Be with her. Fight for her. Don't... don't waste your life away wishing you'd been this courageous youth. It's not a fun choice to look back on from this end of things. I thought you said you made that up. Made what up? The girl with the golden eyes. I lied. I thought so. Look, what's the point now, huh? I have the most beautiful woman in the world on my arm. I have no complaints. Regrets, maybe, but... No complaints. Tomorrow night, there's a show I want to check out. Care to join? What kind of show? Just music. Live music. Perhaps. But right now, I feel like a swim. How about you? Sure. Stop, stop. It's cold. Good. I know, but... When... no, no, no. Don't worry. Wait. No. Can't see. Dad? Henry. You okay? Yeah. I'm fine, thanks. You so rarely call. I thought something was wrong. Yeah, I know. Hen. I... I'm sorry about that. I need to call more often. I really do. Yeah. So should I, I suppose. But, Henry, uh, there's this live music I'm going to with a friend of mine from California. And I was wondering if you would, uh, like to join us, you know, just us guys hitting the town. We'd like that. All right. When? Tomorrow. Tomorrow night. Can you make it? Tomorrow, yeah. Yeah, I can do tomorrow. I-I might bring somebody along, if that's okay. Oh, great. Sure. Whoever. Bring him along. It'd be great. It's a she, actually. Oh. Oh, yeah. Certainly. Yeah. Well, look, uh, in that case, uh, why don't you come by the house? Come on by. We'll have some drinks. Veronica would love to see you. Okay. See you tomorrow, then. See you then. What? So, hen, how's your new play coming along? It's going well, I think. Ana's costumes are gonna be amazing. Really bring everything to life. Only thing is, I don't actually have a lead. The woman I cast has, uh, has just backed down, which is probably for the best. She wasn't really right for the part anyways. It's hard to find English-speaking actresses here in Barcelona that really understand the intricacies of the language. Should have done what you said years ago and moved to New York. But I love my life here. Especially now. Good to see. Really good to see. Sí. Wait a minute. What about Veronica? What? Darling, you are amazing. Really, hen, I think you two would get along very well together. No, it's okay. No. Henry, seriously. Why not, Veronica? Why not? We could try it. No? She would look gorgeous in the new dress. Don't you think so? Yeah. I'm... I'm really touched. I do think you're... you're very talented, Henry. Like your father. And, uh, have you a role for my young friend here? This is too much. Have you acted before? Not really. He's been studying. It's his passion. It's his life force. It's why he's here. To conquer the role of Victor in "tinto." The one role I'll never attempt. Uh, there's a couple of roles I've doubled up. If you really want to try it, I could, uh, see if I can make some changes. Wow. Uh, yeah, I'd be honored. Thank you. Well, what time is this music thing tonight? Should we... should we be going pretty soon? Uh, you know what? It's not really that big of a deal. We don't have to go. Oh, come on. We're all here together. It'll be great. Yeah. It sounds really fun. Come on. Let's go. Salute. Salute. Ta. You've not got a drink. Uh, I think Carlo has my drink. I'll go and check. You okay, kid? Something up? You feeling all right? Yeah, I think I just got a little too much sun. If you need to go home, you know, it's no problem. I'm fine. Thanks. Hey, Carlo. What? You get my drink? Sweetie, are you okay? I'm fine. Fine. Thanks. I-I think I just need a little air. I'll be right back. Sure. What happened? Gracias. De nada. You... Look... It's one thing for you to mess around with your own fate. It's quite another to involve yourself in mine. H-How dare you set this up? How dare you? What... what were you thinking? I didn't know she would be here. Oh, you... you've been planning this all along, haven't you? You were following me, weren't you? Is this some kind of crazy, messed up game to you? This is my life. I didn't mean for it to go this way. What way did you mean for it to go? You're the one that told me to be courageous. You're the one that wrote all those plays about her. You're the one that said, "go, be brave," and all of that. I saw that he was playing here tonight. I thought... You and I would go. Hey. What's going on? You okay? Fine. Fine. Fine. Have you upset him? Honey, everything is fine. Okay. You want to go back inside? Henry's looking for you. Sure. Sure. Let's go back inside. Let's... let's go. Let's go enjoy the music. Oh, boy, it's hot in there. Yes, it is. Yes. Carlo? Liz. It is really you, isn't it? You stayed in Spain? Oh, look at you! Liz, I-I want you to meet, is this your daughter? No, she... oh, what a beauty. I'm his girlfriend. She's not my daughter. She's... nice to meet you, Liz. We're going back inside now. Yeah, I'll... I'll be in, in a minute. Carlo. Do you know it is my son up there, the trumpet player? Time flies, doesn't it? Yeah. Yeah, it does. I'm going back inside. See you inside. Your son is a wonderful Musician. Yeah. Yeah, he is. Um, I'm a bit biased, but... Yes. I'm James. I-I would guess son, but, um, I made a full pot tonight already. You want to join me back inside? Yes. Let's go. I don't know why you think I'm so stupid. What are you saying, Veronica? I know who she is. I've read your plays. I know exactly who she is. So don't... don't try and tell me she's just an old friend. I'm sorry, Veronica. I had no idea she'd be here. It was the kid. He set this all up. I-I had no clue. I don't know what he was thinking. I saw the way you looked at her. You've never looked at me like that. I've never seen that in your eyes. That's all ancient history. Dust and cobwebs. You say that, but I saw your eyes. This is enough. Veronica. Veronica, wait. I'm so sorry. I-I had no idea she would be there. Please, Veronica, stop. Please, baby. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Carlo? Carlo! Carlo. Hi. It's James. Hello. Hi. Hello. What is it? Oh, this is, um, tinto de verano. Wine of summer? Yeah. Sí. Were you ever called Eliza? Yes. A long time ago. A long, long time ago. Why do you ask? I see you here. And I see it all so clearly. What you must have been like. What that summer must have been like when he wrote about it. What do you mean? When Carl wrote the play. I never read his plays. Any of them. Why not? It's too complicated, and a too long story for tonight. I have all the time in the world, though. I can't believe you never read any. None of them? I was writing my own things. And when Carlo's plays started to get well-known, I... It was... I didn't want to be influenced by them. It's boring. It's really boring. Tell me about you. I want to know about you. You should read them. Hey. James? There is something I want you to tell Carlo. Say hi from la Serena. La Serena? He'll know what it means. So, my friend, if I don't see you again in Spain, have an amazing adventure. And I do hope you find everything you're looking for. Thank you. Bueno días. You, too? What? I've never... I've never let myself... Fall in love with anyone before. Until you. You. Then I must be very lucky. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you. Go, please. Just leave, okay? Okay. I'll go get my things. Please do. Are you okay? No. No, not okay. I'm sorry. You... you... you do stupid things. It is one thing to change your life, but why do you come here and try to change mine? I'm really sorry about that. I had no idea she would be there. I don't know why you came here or what you want, but what I know is I don't want you in my house. I understand. Who do you think you are? I don't know who I am right now. Really, believe me, I didn't mean to upset you. You know what I did tonight? I was at the hospital all night with Carlo. Oh, no. Is he okay? Yeah, he's okay. He's sleeping now. But for a moment, I thought I lost him, and... You... Just leave, okay? Go. Bueno días. Sorry to disturb, but I should have called before. Um, I've been making some revisions to the scripts. I've got a copy there for you and for James. Um... You okay, Veronica? You... James is not here. Do you want something to drink? Coffee? Something? Uh, yeah. That's great. Thanks. Thank you. Are you sure you're okay, Veronica? You don't look too good. We had to go to the hospital last night. He had one of his episodes. Oh, my god. Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? At times like this, Veronica, you really should call me. Don't be angry with me. It's been a rough night. I've been up all night, all the doctors. And what do they say? The usual thing... too much excitement. He needs to slow down. I was so scared. You... you should go and see him. Hey. Easy, easy. I am not dead. I can see that. But you are stubborn. Why am I here? You okay, dad? Why... why am I here? Why am I here in this house with that... that poor girl? She deserves so much more than this. Sitting beside the bed of an old man and scared to death. I can't put her through this again, you know. Look... Henry. I need to ask you something. Of course. Whatever. What is it? What is this? Are you leaving? Are you leaving me for that woman? After I stay all night in the hospital thinking you might die? Is that what you're doing? I love you. I love you so much. You can't do this to me. I'm just gonna camp out at Henry's for a few days. That's all. I-I just don't want you sitting around here waiting for me to die. Oh, don't say that! You need someone younger, some... someone who can give you babies if you want them, some... Someone to grow old with. You are what I need. I love you. You're my angel. I Cherish you. You... you came and you saved my life when it needed saving, but I don't want to be your burden. You're not my burden. You're my life. Oh, baby. I'll never love anyone like I love you. Yes, you will. Believe me. You will. Henry. Hey. Come up? Yeah. Hey. How are you? I brought you a copy of the script so you can get started. I made a few changes. I'd like you to do the role of Ezekiel. Originally I had it doubled up. I think I prefer you to do that. Thank you. I'm really honored. So, first rehearsal's on Tuesday, then every night until we open, which is in two weeks. Okay. Don't let me down. I'll do my best not to. Okay. How do you sleep? Oh, fine. Thanks. A comfy, little bedroom you got back there. Then it suits you. Thanks. Oh, this is black. Anything I can, uh, help with? Uh, for the play, I mean? Well, it's the dress rehearsal tonight. Love to hear your notes. I'll be there. They took the child from her Arms. Both: They took the child. Silently he swoops in. Silently he swoops in, a nightingale on angel's wings. He adored her. I adore her. Light beyond light. The heat, frozen hot. I never tried to. I never even tried. I asked, and you entered. He asked, and you entered. It all means nothing. It all means nothing without you. Dad. Listen, I've got a few things I need to just wrap up here. So if you don't mind, we'll meet up at the house later. Oh, okay. That's fine. No problem. You can give me your notes there. Oh, Henry, it was... it was great. Um, really good. And Ana's costumes, they were... They were something else. Thanks. Hey, um, did, uh, Veronica leave? Yeah, she had to shoot off. I'm... I'm sure she wanted to say goodbye. Well, I'll, uh, I guess I'll see you back at the house. Sounds good. Oh, hey. Kid, you did it. You... you're an actor now, whether you like it or not, huh? Thanks. Want to join me for a drink? Yeah, I'd love to. A little bar right around the corner there. Look, I just want to say that I'm sorry. Everybody's sorry. But don't you be sorry, kid. No, but I am. You are someone with... with dreams and... and hopes and... And intuitions, bad as they may be sometimes. I-I admire that, to be able to leave that safety net and just leap, leap into the oblivion blindly, not knowing if you're doing the right thing. Just knowing you must do it. You act as if you have nothing to aspire to, as if it's all done and behind you, but I don't believe that. I think you should write something. No. I think the world expects it of you, and I think you should do it. I'm not so sure I should be taking advice from you. What about your girl, your... Your doctor? Have you spoken to her? Well, I call, but she doesn't answer. But I did do something grand and dramatic. I bought her a ticket to Portugal and sent it to her. She's always wanted to go. So after the show wraps, I'll head down that way, and if she decides I'm worth it, then she'll be there when I get there. That sounds pretty grand. And if I lose her, at least I tried. And you were right. I should have followed her. I give a lot of advice that I don't even follow myself. Maybe you should stop listening to me. I'm really glad you made it out. It means a lot to me. Me, too. Oh, I meant to tell you. Uh, the night... the night that we ran into Liz, she told me to tell you something. What? What'd she say? What? She said, "la Serena says hi." She said that? La Serena? Yeah. What does it mean? The mermaid. I can't believe she remembered that. No, I-I got this one. I think... I think I owe you. Oh, thanks. La Serena. H-Hello. Excuse me. I'm sorry to disturb you. I'm... I'm looking for your mother, actually. Uh, I'm Carl, an old friend of hers, and, uh, perhaps she's back in New York. My plan only got me this far. She's inside, actually. She's inside? Yeah. Let me get the door. You still have that old thing? Hi. Oh, how do you like that... That play? It's wonderful. So you found me. I have a friend who would say it was fate. You know, maybe it is. So... So... Would you like some wine? Oh, yeah. That would be lovely. Yeah. Records. Who has records anymore? Why did you ever leave me?
