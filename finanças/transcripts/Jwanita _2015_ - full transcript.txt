I don't want to befriend you. I want to befriend Jenin. Jenin. Come and be my friend. See. You're such a cutie. Mom, dad asked if you've taken your shower? If you haven't, dad is not going to kiss you. Your dad is so naughty. - Let's kiss Mom. - Have you showered? - Of course I have. - We want to kiss Mom too. Let's kiss together.

This is my brother. Tell her your name. My name is Fitri. Who are you? Where are you going to? This is your house? Where's your Mom? This aunty looks like the woman in the photo. Mom said, this is her sister. Dila, Fitri. Aunty Nona, is this Mom's sister? - Let's go into the house. - Let's go, aunty. - Hurry up, aunty. - Hurry up. Let's go. Julaika. Sister? How are you? I've been searching for you since you disappeared. I asked for the police's help, but I still couldn't find you. But I never gave up looking for you. And now, you've found me. I don't want to trouble your family. But, you're the only one I have, Julaika. Sister. You haven't troubled me at all. Never. Farhan will be happy to know that you're going to stay with us. Furthermore, we have many rooms in our house. I only ask one favor. Don't abandon me again. - Aunt Jwanita, hurry up! - Hurry up! Come here! Hurry up! The kids love their Aunt Jwanita. See. I asked Jwanita to stay with us. You're okay with it, right? Why didn't you discuss with me first? What if she falls sick again? You are a psychiatrist. Why did you say that? - It's just Jwanita. - Okay. Run! Hurry up and pass it to me! What were you doing upstairs? Why are you roaming around one's house in the middle of the night? One day, this house will become mine, Miss Nona. And I will bury all of you under this house and make it a grave. Do you understand? You have to understand, this house is not suitable for a lunatic like you. If you can, tomorrow, please go back to your own house. Don't stay here for too long. You are a mess. Do you understand? You are a mess. The scar is fading, isn't it? Maybe you need a new scar. Not only on your arm, but on your face, or your whole body. Satan! Don't you dare try to fool me! I'm not scared of you. Wawa. Everyday, I feed you. If you could talk, I would have been with you. You are fair, I am dark. Kadir, come here. Oh God, Nona. You scared me. What's the fuss this early in the morning? You've had a long holiday. Did you notice? We have a mysterious guest. Mysterious guest? Who? Miss Jwanita? I think she's nice and pretty. I like her. Both of you are always flirting whenever I come here. Are you slacking off? I'll report this to our boss. Shut up! I'm losing sleep. Here. Do you still remember the crazy woman I told you about before? She has come back to mess things up. We have to work together to chase her out of this house. Understand? Wait a minute. Which crazy woman, Nona? Hello. I'm Jwanita, your employer's favorite sister. I'm a new member of this family forever. I'm Megat, Dr. Farhan's personal manager. I'm always here. We can meet often, Miss Jwanita. I'm Kadir. I take care of Master Farhan's house. Wawa and Jenin are my friends. If you want to ride on Wawa, I can teach you. Riding the horse, and taking a stroll on the beach. It's fun, isn't it? I love horseback riding too. What a coincidence. We can ride together. So fragrant. Both of you are overreacting, just like Jenin. - She's jealous. - How did you know? Do you think I can be with her? That's why ghosts have no legs or bodies. - No. - And this? - That doesn't have a body. - I don't know. - Dad, say something. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. - Peace be upon you too. Peace be upon you, Farhan. You're early today. You must be tired. Let me help you. Draw someone in red. Do you want anything to drink? I'll bring it to you. Take this one. Thank you, Nona. Have a drink, Farhan. How was your work today? Come. What's wrong with you? Nothing. I'm learning to be a good wife. - Look at this, Dad. - Let me see. What is this? This is Mom. Mom? Why did she become this? Aunt Jwanita said, when Mom is dead, she will turn into a ghost like this. - Right? - Yes, you're right. You don't know how to serve your employer. Next time, prepare a hot drink when Mr. Farhan comes home. Be it coffee or tea. Not just plain water. I've prepared everything. One more thing, I've worked here for almost ten years. You don't have to teach me how to work. Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. - Peace be upon you too. See who's back. - Mom! - Mom! What are you drawing? - A house. - Such a big house! Not really. Are you tired? Yes, I'm extremely tired. I want a kiss. You'll get it now. Can we play after this? Pity your Mom. She's tired. I miss Mom too. Why did you call me? Okay? Really? Let's sit together. Such a happy family. Let's have tea. Let's eat. - Only for Mom and Dad. - Oh, no. You get cookies. - Do you want? - I want! Thank you. Thank you for taking the trouble to make us drinks. - Where's Nona? - Nona? I think she's tidying up in the back. The drink Aunt Nita made is tasty. - I want. - Okay. It's good, right? What's the crazy woman doing here? O dear light Red as the breathing blood Light me up In this night Whoever is in my way Death will answer him Dila, Fitri, come and eat. Nona. Why the troubled face? How can I not be troubled, Mr. Farhan? I didn't sleep the whole night. Why? Yesterday evening, when I was collecting snails at the river, I saw that woman. I followed her. Then I saw her chanting on the rock. It was so scary, Mr. Farhan. It was as though she was calling the devil. I looked at her for some time. Suddenly a big red eye stared at me. I quickly ran home, Mr. Farhan. Who is this person? - It's... - Good morning. Let's eat together. It's nasi lemak. Nona cooked all this? She's so hardworking. - Come eat with us. - Wait a minute. I can't wait to eat your meat alive, Nona. You're afraid that Julaika will be jealous? Why are you here? I'll never be far away from you, even when I'm dead. You have to accept the truth. Truth can be created. You came into my life when I already had her. If you have her, I still have you. Hi, Kadir. Hi. I want to ask if you know what's kept in the hut below the tank. The homeowner keeps his old things in the hut. - But it hasn't been used for a long time. - Really? You have the key? The key? I kept it on the top of the door there. Why, Miss Jwanita? It's okay. Nothing. Go away! Go away! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! - Open the door, Nona! - Go away! - Go away! - Nona! Nona! Nona! Nona? Nona? You're not coming with us? Sister. You should come with us. You'll think of Nona if you go back to that house. We'll be worried if you are alone at home. Don't worry. I'm used to being alone. Someone has to take care of the house. Take care. I'll be on my way. Oh God. I'm weak. Why, Megat? Nothing. It's just... Are you sure you want to stay in this house alone? Yes, I am sure. - You... - Anything else? Don't you feel scared? If I feel scared, I'll call you. Are you willing to accompany me? Of course I am, but... Oh God. I missed it! But don't come if I don't call you. Okay. She really scared me. Spirit of the night, unite my blood and the rain into one. Spirit of the night, wake up the spirits of the inhabitants of the universe, and in my black realm. Spirit of the night, let the red spirit live with me! Peace be upon you, Miss Jwanita. Sorry for not informing you that I'd be coming over. What's wrong? What are you doing here? Don't you feel cold? Red light Oh red light of mine Dancing with me Where have you been What has been promised In the middle of the night - Aunty! - Hi, sweetheart. - Did you have fun traveling? - Yes. Dear. What's wrong? I saw Nona just now. She's there. - There. - Dear, look into my eyes. There's nothing. It's okay. How about the kids? Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Don't think too much. Let's go. Brother, I'm scared. Don't be scared. It's just the dog. Okay? Don't be scared. It sounds like when Aunt Nona died. Don't say that. Hurry up, sister! Dila, Fitri? Aunty, we are scared. Aunty Nona has become a ghost. She looks horrendous. I'm here. As long as I'm here, don't be afraid. I will protect both of you forever. Okay? Good morning, my sweethearts. Wake up. We're going out. Hurry up. Dila, Fitri, hurry up! - Hurry up. - I'm sleepy. I want to stay at home. Sleep, sleep. If you are hungry, I've prepared some food downstairs. Our kids are still sleeping, dear. Stop doing this. They need to know that I'm also their Mom. Farhan? Farhan. What the hell? Come to me Come to me Oh God. -At night time -Megat's not answering the phone. Beautiful face, alone by myself Hello? Megat! It's me, Kadir. Tonight will be mine It's the truth! I'm not lying! Oh God! What did I hit? Who are you looking for? Why are you doing this to me? Where is my sweetheart? My sweetheart is everywhere Where are you? My dear sister My dear sister is in my heart Your singing is so cute. I really love hearing that song. Back when Aunt Jwanita and I were young, we used to sing that song at school. I'm your Mom, not aunt anymore. - Right, kids? - Yeah. Fine, Mom it is. Time to recite the Qur'an with me. Let's go. Oh, Mom. We want to... - Continue singing? - Yes. - Right? - Let's sing. Yeah, it's my turn to sing now. - Where are you? - Fitri! - Come here! - My sweetheart - My sweetheart... - Dila, let's go. What's wrong with you, Julaika? Just let them be, if they don't want to. You don't have to force them. How many times have I told you? Don't be stubborn when I tell you to recite the Qur'an. I want to be their Mom too. Let's recite the Qur'an. Go in. What is she doing? Come out! Come out! Where's Megat? His car is here. He has gone fishing. With Kadir.

Bring us toys when you come back. I want a big teddy bear. - I don't like it. - You... You already have many teddy bears in your room. The teddy bears will come alive one-by-one, and eat you. Dad, he's teasing me again. Don't fight or your Mom will be angry, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Okay. Listen to your Mom, okay? - Okay. - No fighting with your brother. - Okay? - Okay. Bye. - Bye! - Bye! Drive carefully. Mom, Aunt Nona is dead. Why has she become a ghost and disturbed us? Oh, you. Aunt Nona loved us. She won't disturb us. Don't talk about that. Sleep properly.
