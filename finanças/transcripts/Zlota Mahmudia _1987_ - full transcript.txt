A long time ago... ...no one knows when... ...it is known only that Gyorgy was a fisherman... ...and that the local Turk, Mahmudia Bay... ...had a beautiful daughter named Rada. Gyorgy and Rada were madly in love... ...but she was promised to her father's cousin, the Turkish ruler. A dowry was arranged, unmatched by anything seen before. Rada wept all night. In a secret tryst, aided by her Bulgarian mother... ...under cover of night, she got into a boat... ...and sailed to the mouth of the Ropotamo. The Ropotamo is a river which flows into the Black Sea, in Bulgaria. The red disk of the sun appeared above the waves. Fear seized the fugitives. Like crow wings, a thick mist closed in on them. Blasted by severe wind, the sea raged... ...and the boat crashed on the coastal cliffs. No one survived... ...the catastrophe. The treasure? What happened to the treasure? Was it the entire dowry of Rada? Yes, you're right. It sunk to the bottom... ...and to this day has not been found. But searches are conducted... ...unceasingly. Old people say... ...if anyone wants to steal the treasure... ...black clouds gather over Ropotamo... ...and a storm builds up... ...just like the storm that sunk the treasure. They claim that the ghosts of Gyorgy and Rada... ...guard access to the treasure. Creepy? I love such stories. "Golden Mahmudia" - Hey. - Hey. - I had an unusual dream... - Never mind, let's go. Where? Now? Before breakfast? We don't have a minute to lose. - Hop down. - But... Quick! Someone will show up! Stas, what are you doing? Treasure. Do you understand? Treasure. Yesterday, I overheard old Angel, the owner of "Sikka"... ...talking with the others. They talked about getting the treasure. We're joining them. Such a chance comes once in a hundred years! Hey, won't we get into trouble or danger? Silly. - And if we find it? - Stop! You wuss! Keep your mouth shut! If you don't like it, just disembark! I'm staying. - Ready? - Ready. Cast off. - Good morning, Dad. - Hi. Has Petrek turned up? - No, why do you ask? - He's not in his room. He must have flown through a hole in his roof. Really Dad, it's nothing to joke about. He's been gone more than an hour. Slavko, finish shaving and go look, something may have happened. I'll warm his ears, when he returns. It seems that once again he's up to something. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. How are you? Dad, Stas tied me up... ...covered me with a blanket... ...and locked the door. - Have you, by chance, seen Stas? - No. That's one more gone missing. You haven't seen any trace of our Petrek? But I know what happened to Petrek! Look! This lay in the room on the floor. It was crumpled, and inside was a stone. Where did it come from, Thomas? It was probably thrown through the window. Show me. Listen. "Don't worry about me. I'll be home in the evening at dinner, and tell everything, Petrek ". Obviously, they left together. But the question is, where to? One of us will stay on board. There's nobody here. Well, not quite. There's a man in the pilothouse. If you agree, we can force him to follow our plan. And now what? Can you start the engine? Of course! Come on! Not like that, dummy! You must do it like a real sailor... ...nimble and fast. - It's done. - Did you hide it well? Yes, I don't need to be taught. But are you sure the dynamite won't get wet? Don't worry, Zachary. You think old Gyorgy doesn't know anything? You were still in diapers when I was already a hardened fisherman. Dynamite! So I'm not mistaken. We're on track! - We were lucky this time! - I know. I'll bet you anything...they'll get the treasure! The stormy Black Sea. Think of the rocks. They've sunk more than one boat! You remember my father told about Rada and the fisherman? Their boat crashed here at the mouth of Ropotamo. There's some truth in every legend! I'm telling you, they're after that treasure! I know! I know. I had a dream about it! Keep still about your dreams! Let's go. He's asleep. C'mon. There aren't any lifeboats. How far to the shore? - Three hundred meters? - I think so too. Can you swim over? - I don't think so. - I don't care what you think! If we could just swim to shore... ...we'd have it made! We could sneak to the pier, and... ...from there watch what they bring up from the bottom. Will you swim? What are you doing here? Pirates! What's the matter? Pirates kidnapped Petrek! Dad, Dad, I know, where Petrek is. - He was kidnapped by pirates. - Who? - Petrek. - So what happened? They wanted to sell him... on the slave market. He was strapped to the mast... ...and I was going to free him. - Well? - And then I woke up. It's very good you woke up then... ...because at any moment you could have been kidnapped. And in the future, don't eat so much... ...because on a full belly, one dreams nonsense. - Eh? - Yasha! - Yasha! Dad caught a fish like this! - Like this? Like this! Right, Dad? True, but I've not seen our boys. - Dad. - What? Maybe they really were kidnapped. By whom? Pirates? Maybe. But in that case... ...they made a terrible mistake because we're going to their rescue... ...and to take revenge! We won't give up! We don't really need to go on the deck! There the sun roasts you, here it's comfortable. Hey, guys. Pass me my food bag. Clear off! Take it yourself! You're not our master, either! No servants here! Now see what you've done! It had been better to give it to him! Don't whine. Instead, find something we can spring the bolt with! - Found it! - What? - Knife. - Really? You're not kidding? We're saved! It probably fell out of the bag with tomatoes. Show me! Listen...brother, everything's fine. The hatch is open. You know what I thought up? You stay here with my things... ...while I swim to shore to see what's going on. You're not afraid to stay here alone? - Nope. - That's good. I'll lock you in. If he looks in, you know nothing. You were sleeping and that's that! Somehow or other, they know too much! We need to keep an eye on them till we finish the job. Get up! Where's your buddy? What? Your friend. I don't know! Up to the deck with you! - You don't know where your pal is? - No idea! - Okay, then it's only you. - C'mon! Give it. Catch! Get in. Go ahead! - Let go of the boat! - Get in! Lie down on the floor and keep your head down. I don't want you to be visible. Remember, if you raise your head... ...or show any other sign of yourself... ...you'll be in big trouble! You'll feel the oar on your head, and I have a heavy hand. While I'm here you won't touch him. Since when have you become so gentle? You take pity on him? D'you know him? He's a guest, from Poland. Catch! Can you help me make dinner? Well, what is it? Put your things down... ...and go collect firewood. Aren't you afraid I'll run away? You don't even know where we are. Anyway, you won't take off before dinner. And then...well, we'll see. Young... ...but not bad. Not at all. Aha. Ah...there you are, at last. And us? We'll have to wait. If you stay, you'll get to eat. But I'm hungry! Tend the fire while I'm gone. I'll be right back. Don't worry, I haven't forgotten about you. I left you a little soup. Here, eat it. I lost my knife. It was a keepsake from my father. Did you really treasure your knife? Is this yours? Wow! Where did you find it? I found, it by accident, in the cabin. I took it, thinking it may come in handy. If it's yours, here, I give it back. Thank you, good chap. It's full of memories for me. By those rocks is a spring...a small one. Wash out this pot and bring some water. Petrek, I'm here! Make sure you're not seen... stay in the bushes! - Now what? - Nothing. I'm exhausted and starving! You can't even imagine how hungry I am. Here, that's all I have. What will we do? I wish I were at home. I've had enough of this! I found the lost one! Gyorgy, give me the rope! Now, they'll not run away! Here they are. - Sit down here. - Zachary... ...go and check on the divers. Come on, move it! Okay. If he's onto something, we must be ready to open our chest. Where's the knife we found? We better watch them. They seem suspect to me. Why? We could have cut the ropes. And now what?? We'll let them go tomorrow. Tonight they can stay here, by the sea. Get ready, we sail! We must reach the harbour before the storm hits. I have a plan. You're not made of glass. That's lucky. In the worst case, your faces will be washed by rainwater. We'll prevent you from snooping... ...and other stupid things. Learn what it's like to stay on the beach alone. Let us go! It's out of question! You'll stay until evening... ...and then, maybe, we'll free you. A storm's coming! Nothing will happen to you. There aren't wolves... ...or jackals around. They stay away from the shore. Your worst bites will be mosquito bites. Be sure you keep quiet now! How do we get loose? We're finished! You see what comes of being honest? We'd have the knife if you hadn't been so daft. Are you strong? At school I can take on 16 year-olds, even 18. Good...super! I've got advice for you chaps. Am I right that I can talk with you like adults? Yes, but first you must free us. Me and my pal. I can! You must give your word that you won't escape. You have our word! Get dressed quickly. You can help me and I can help you. - Do you want to sleep at home tonight? - Of course. - Do you swim well? - Are you kidding? I can swim at least to those rocks from here. Good, very good. I need an assistant just like you. Let's make it a deal, guys. You help me, and I'll set you both free. Really? Free us? I swear by Saint Nicholas. Only help me first, and then... - What then? - Then you will be completely free. Good. What about Angel? Don't you worry about him, that's my business. We have a personal score to settle.. Okay, but what do we need to do? I'll tell you, but only if you first agree. Think about it! Well? What's the verdict? - Agreed. - Agreed. That's good, guys. Come on, then. - Waiting for someone? - Oh yes. "Sikka". Your brother hasn't turned up yet? No, sunk like a stone in water. We can't find him. My parents are here to talk to the port authorities. Maybe he sailed on Sikka? My place was vacant. Mum, this is Mitko. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Hey. You know anything about the boys? No, but Sikka's just coming in. Maybe they know something. I'll go ask. Zhoro... Oh, hi! Look what we caught! Listen, did you happen to see two small boys anywhere? No. We didn't see any, no. - Bye, then - See you later. Sorry, they haven't seen them. Wait a minute, folks. - Angel? - Yes. You haven't perchance seen somewhere... Greetings. ...you haven't seen two 11-year-old boys around Ropotamo? - No, I haven't. - And you, Zachary? No. Get out here. Give me the rope. Come. Go up there. And that one. Come. Go up to him. Why are you standing there? Make yourself at home. Do you live here? From time to time. But it's very cold here! Then put on sweaters... ...which lie on the bed. Take them. Okay. Ready! Now, at least it's warm! So we can set to work! And then we can all have a snack. I'm very hungry. Your work will be rewarded with food. You can read in the Holy Book, "He who doth not work, doth not eat". We need to prepare the gadget. Oh, you see? This is a special rope made of hemp. Woven only at night. - And why? - You understand... ...to get the treasures, we need specially made tools. They are made only at night... ...in the light of the moon, full moon. If you don't fulfill this requirement... ...you won't find anything. Even the hafts for the shovels must be made... ...under the full moon. Strange. What are you mumbling about? - Nothing. - Nothing There's something else you must know. The most important. Treasure hunting is only for the brave. Good fortune smiles on them... ...and ensures them happiness. Be sure you don't forget that. Well, why are you staring at me? I was not always a fisherman. Now a small snack before the work that awaits us. Take it. What kind of work? Ahh, just wait. You'll see in half a minute. Stay here, please. I've told you before to leave me in peace. I've a bad feeling about it, Angel. You won't find the treasure. For years, many have searched without finding it. All they found was death at sea. Not a word to anyone about where I went. I'm in the fields, as was agreed... ...with Sergei. You understand me? Come on, old chap, don't be afraid, the treasure awaits us. Come here. Very good. Almost ready. Now... Guys, bring the rope, okay? Grab the rope, I'll wind it in on while you keep hold of it. Listen, boy, you stay on shore by the winch. When I give the signal, start winding in. Of course, you won't have to pull it up all alone. We'll make sure it's well attached. Do you understand? And you, what's your name? Stas! Stas? It's the first time I heard that name. Mum's called Polka. - In Poland, it's a popular name. - Good. Listen, guys. We must dive at least four meters under water. The treasure chest sits there on the seabed. We need to tie it and position it so... ...that when we to start to winch... ...it will stay on the planks and move freely up to the beach. Clear? And what about the divers? Enough questions. I have nothing more to say. I just need your help, nothing more. Kids! However, you must know... ...you're not allowed to tell about what we're doing. Not a single word. Otherwise, all may be lost. So say experienced treasure hunters. What's in the chest? If I only knew. Maybe, someone up there knows? All the other divers made the same mistake. They searched on the other side of the cliff... ...but I found this chest... ...and now it's mine, you understand? However, there's a risk. The chest could be empty...or could... - Treasure? - Treasure. And maybe some for you. The most important thing now is to pull up the chest. - Are you ready? - Yes! - Good. Did you hear? We get some of the treasure! Maybe it's from the wreck my dad was telling about. We're like real pirates! - Hello. - What do you want? - Isn't Angel at home, Aunt? - Am I now your aunt? Why not get to the point? What do you want? I need to talk with Angel. Come tomorrow evening. What about this evening? Angel went on his watch to guard watermelons. Good night, my aunt. Zachary, don't lie. I saw how you looked at each other when the captain asked about the boys. I thought maybe it involved Angel. But he wasn't home, as I told you. It's a pity you don't want to help us. The boys can catch colds! You know well that a storm is on its way! Bye. - Wait. - What do you want? I know where the boys are. Speak. - They stayed in Ropotamo. - With whom? I don't know. But Angel's on his way there. You mean that they're being held there by force? - I only know that they remained. - Are you deceiving me? I swear I'm telling the truth. Come on, you must tell the parents. No, no, don't even ask, no, I'm not going. Then I'll tell them myself. Agneshka! Did you find out? I found out everything, they're being kept by force in Ropotamo. - The boys are found. - Where? - In Ropotamo? Yes, but how did you find out? I dreamed it. Pirates kidnapped Petrek. Yasha, enough with your dreams! Please tell us, what happened. I don't know much. Zachary told me that the the boys are with a fisherman. It seems that Angel is on his way out to them. He wouldn't tell me more. We'll go there. We'll get all the details later. Put the tray down. Wait, I'll give you a raincoat. Wait, my mother gave raincoats! Oh, thank you. Wait here. Agneshka, stay with them. - Good afternoon. - We're looking for Zachary... Not here... ...he left in a daze for Ropotamo. What crazy business are you all up to? We have no other choice than to go there. Let's go. Go on!! Move! This isn't necessary! Stubborn old beast! There it is! There it is! We've got it! Stay away! Well, don't just stand there! Hand me the flagon! Oh, my treasure! Thank you, God! Sir, Sir, excuse me... ...but what's in the chest? Why don't you open it? What? Clear off from here, you brats! Well! Be quick! I don't want to see you again! Begone! You've never seen me or this place! Quick, now! Run! I can't take anymore! At home, they're worrying! And I'm here! I have no more strength. Are we a long way off? Don't worry, we're close to the road. But in such rain, it makes no sense to walk. We must wait here. Oh, look, there's a farm. Stas, did you hear the blast? What blast? You dreamed it. Just for the record, I did have a dream... ...that Gyorgy blew up the rock that blocks the entrance to the cave Sesame. Dynamite? Gyorgy used dynamite to open the chest! I'll bet! The rain stopped. Come on. Come. He's not here. Look, the fire's out. Do you think it's because he put it out... ...or because of the downpour? He should be here somewhere. It's a great pity, but the whole time... ...I understand now, he wanted to get rid of us. To be rid of both witnesses. We must check it out. He fled. He took all his stuff. - There! There! - What? The chest! You see? By the water! - Empty? - Empty. Maybe you're wrong? Look a coin! It was stuck in a crack. Someone's coming! Gyorgy! Gyorgy! Robbed! Robbed! Robbed! - After him! - I won't. It makes no sense. He'll see us... ...such jackasses as we are... ...and catch us and kick us about the ears! And what will we do? - Chickening out? - Go yourself, if you're so smart! And here I go! Well? The road goes no further. We must go on foot. Fine. On our way! Let's go! - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Can you lend us a boat? Yes, sure! Listen, I think, we now need to split up. The three in the boat will look along the beach... ...and two will comb the beach. That way we'll find them. - Good? Clear? - Good. Agneshka and I can comb the beach... ...and you take the kids in the boat? I know this place, and won't get lost in the bush. That's in fact, what I thought. Let's get going. Get in the boat. I found you. It's good you came. I thought you'd given up. Stop babbling... ...or he'll hear us. Put this on. Hurry. That's Angel. Come here. Do you hear me? What did you do with the trunk? What did you do with the trunk? Take it easy, take it easy! I hid it well. Don't lie to me! It lies empty on the bay! - You stole everything! - Easy, easy. What was inside? There was nothing! They have gold! Put it down. It's mine. Gyorgy, what are you doing? It's both of ours. Where's my knife? Where's the knife? What happened to my knife? Look for it. It might be lying somewhere. Angel, Angel ... I ... I was joking. It's ours. We'll divide it fairly. At last I found you. This is Gyorgy's knife. They're fighting. Give it to me. This is not a toy. Show me. One ... one ... One... - One. - Mine. Wait. Watch out! Hello, Angel. Don't worry. Give him one in the ear, so he turns a somersault. Come on! I don't want anything to do with this. Do what you want. - Just give me the dynamite. - What dynamite? Give me what I gave you! - I didn't come for the treasure. - What for then? - Will you give it or not? - And if not, then what? - I'll show you. - Let me go. Oh, if only my dad were here! He loves to beat up bad guys. You know, like in the movies. No crook escapes his punishment. Don't be a bore! You have a great dad... ...but it was only parts in the movies. In real life everything's different. We must rely on our own strength. We're going out! - Put that hatchet down! - Let go of me! - Guard! To the rescue! - Guard! Help! Water! And bring some cloth! Angel, in the boat! Let's get out of here... ...before a whole crowd shows up. - Leave me! - Come on. - Leave me! Dad! Dad! There's Gyorgy! He escaped with the treasure! Sir, go to the shore! Come to your senses! This is my treasure, mine! Help! Come here! Run, get the guys out of the boat, I shut off the engine. It's fine with him, he only swallowed some water. Dad! Dad, there in the reeds! Zachary's wounded. Run and drag him to the boat. Look after them! And what about him? Nothing. He fainted, but will come around shortly. Old fellow... ...did we really need those gold pieces? They've sunk to the bottom. No one will find them in the sludge. You'd have to drain all of Ropotamo. Nobody will ever find this treasure. It lies in the river silt. Round Turkish coins... ...of pure gold... ...with ribbed rims. On one side scribbled unintelligible characters. On the other... ...decorated with a secret Turkish coat of arms. Golden Mahmudia... ...thin, hard, malleable... ...of sparkling gold. Golden Mahmudia. - Keep it...in memory. - Thank you.
