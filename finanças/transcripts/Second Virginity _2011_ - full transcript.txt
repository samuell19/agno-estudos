Good morning. Thank you. It must feel good. So cool. Poor man... It's been 3 days. When's he gonna wake up? You need to ask the Doctor. The Doctor will be here by noon tomorrow. I want to move him to a well-equipped hospital. At this moment, it's not the right time to move him, because of his condition. Don't worry, it's going to be okay. Excuse me. It's alright, I'm sure you'll recover. You'll get better, well return to Japan together. I've finally found you... From now, we'll always be together. Koh, I love you. 3 Days Earlier Koh...! It wasn't easy finding you. Boss wants to meet. You're a big problem! Koh! Wait! Wait! I regret to say that he's beyond help. I've done everything I can, the gunshot has seriously damaged major organs. He may have a few more days. But... I thought his surge went well. Well yes, it did, but only enough to prolong his life. It's amazing how he's hanging in there despite his condition. It's only a matter of time now. I know it must be difficult for you. I want to move him to a hospital in Singapore. I can't allow that. That's too dangerous. It'll only shorten his life. Are you saying I should just watch him die?! SECOND VIRGINITY Why did you come to Malaysia? I came to look for him. I heard he was in this town. What is your relationship with Yang? Yang?! Who are you talking about? I know you came to look for Yang! He's Japanese. His name is Koh Suzuki. No. Yang Ming-Liang is Taiwanese. I said, he is Japanese. We lived together in Tokyo until 5 years ago. Yang is a gang member of a Chinese Fund making illegal investments in Asia. That can't be! Are you Yang's wife? No, I'm his girlfriend. You said you were with him until 5 years ago? Yes. So, what have you been doing for the past 5 years? Were you looking for him? Or did you forget about him? I never forgot about him. 5 Years Earlier Koh? Giving up so easily?! Rejection in work is opportunity. I know, but... Now go and make it happen. You got it? The number you have dialled is outside the service area... Yes? No way! Koh dumped me, and now you too? Moved on to a new woman? So that's what he's like...? He didn't come back there? Whether he's here or not or dead or alive, I won't give him a divorce. So you wasted a trip here. Thank you, Miss Rui. So your taxi is waiting outside. Thank you. Wait! This is no place for you to do business! It's alright. He helped me. Are you sure? Sure. Thank you. 8 Years Earlier As beautiful as always. Thank you. As expected of the 'Iron Lady of Publishing.' Beauty in strength. How are things going? Been working hard? Yes, thanks to him. After I'd mentored him, he disgraced me by quitting our public Agency. Now he runs an online securities company. I don't expert young guys to have such guts these days. Suzuki! Meet Rui Nakamura, Managing Director at Shinkaisha. Shinkaisha? We're a minor publisher. She's just being modest. Nice to meet you. I'm Nakamura. I'm Suzuki, Mondiale Securities. Pleased to meet you. Why did you disgrace Nasuda, the Financial Agency Head. Tell her. I did no such thing. My role at the Agency had simply run its course. A woman like this can prove useful, you should get to know her. I'm counting on you! I'll start being useful now. Huh! How about doing a book? A book? Like a Financial Services Agency expose? I have no desire to betray them. Or on how an entrepreneur thinks? Thanks anyway. But I have no time for a book. Why not just leave it to me? A bestseller would be good for business. But a bestseller earns only 100 million yen. Please tell me your mobile number. Your number? You're rather pushy. Isn't that frowned upon? It is. I'd rather be frowned upon than not get what I want. Considering that we just met, don't you wonder why I'm being so aggressive? Yes... It's intuition. Perhaps even inspiration. I can see your book becoming a bestseller, and you a darling of the media. I'm sure we'll work together, and you'll thank me for it. Koh, remember me? Koh, remember me? You do remember, Koh... Who are you? Who are you? It's me, Koh. I'm Rui. Do I know you? He's awake! Oh, really? How do you feel? Does your wound hurt? Okay, I will increase the dose of your painkiller. He spoke a little. That's good. But... he has no idea who I am. Maybe it's because of the drugs. Don't worry. It's going to be okay. I'm going to tell the Doctor. I'll be right back. Okay. I said finish by 5pm today! Or you'll no longer be in charge! Sorry to ask, but these need checking ASAP. Alright. Thank you. KOH SUZUKI Could we meet somewhere today? Let's meet in 10 minutes. Yes. Don't miss this chance. Do it! Yes! RUI NAKAMURA Today is impossible. BESTSELLERS Ex-Financial Services Agency Ace on How to Succeed There's a talk by Koh Suzuki, who's introduced a totally new theory... Excuse me. I'll get going. I really want to see you. When are you available? Sorry, but I don't have time. If it's urgent, please contact the editor, Yamada. Mr. Suzuki, this way please. Thank you for your time today. I look forward to it. And so do I. Please sit. Ideals can be achieved. All of mine have been. The 'Prince of Finance'? I can't believe he got such a great break. Managing Director Wakamura vowed to make him a media favourite. Welcome back. Japan needs to learn about using assets for investment. I want to see you. Everything can't go into the securities market, however, investing just part would greatly increase market activity. It's been a while. That's true. I've wanted to thank you in person for some time. Have a seat. What'll you have? Coffee. Order, please. Let's get started. The proposal for your second book. Ms Nakamura, what genres have you dealt with? Every genre possible. Even erotic novels? All types of romance novel. I see. What about in your private life? You've had lots of experiences? Sir, you sure are direct! I got divorced long ago, and since then have excluded love and romantic emotion. "Excluded"? Didn't expect to hear that. "Excluded"? That's hard to believe. You didn't, so we're here like this. That's why we'll end it. No way. We'll end it! No way, we won't end it. Mr. Suzuki, you're in a position to get whatever you want, so may not understand how I feel. Even the privileged should not have some things. I think people should not ask for too much. Wanting too much results in punishment. I'll be punished. If I become involved with you now, my career will suffer. A housewife doesn't want to lose her stable household, and I don't want to lose my career. You won't be punished. But you have... such a wonderful wife. If you also became involved with me- "I'd rather be frowned upon than not get what I want." You said that, Rui. "I'd rather be frowned upon than not get what I want." I learned that from you. That's true. Let's push the limits for this second book also! Let's do our best again! Of course. No. We just had our farewell kiss. I don't want it to end! It's just the beginning... Actually, I haven't been with a man... since I was divorced over 20 years ago. You must be surprised? It's natural to lose your virginity the first time, but not so easy for a woman who's a virgin a second time. I don't want to try with a man... 17 years younger than me. Don't make me feel even more ashamed. I'm glad we met. Let's continue our great book collaboration. Your next book will really sell. If we'd actually ended it then, maybe you wouldn't have been shot here in Malaysia? This scares me, too. I've never loved any woman this much before. Rui... Koh, what are you doing? Come down! I don't know that song. You don't? It was quite popular. Don't know it. You weren't born yet in 1985? I was born, but... It's frustrating that you know it, but I don't. I don't want to get sunburned. It'll leave blotches. So, teach me that song. You don't need to know it. What's that look for? Thank you. May your loved one be blessed with tranquillity. Thank you for your blessing. If he drinks this water, he will be cured. You're awake... How do you feel? I just got cold water, I'll sponge you off. My throat. You want water? Alright. Just at little. Okay. Why are you doing this? It's alright, you'll remember soon. Close it! Too bright? Close it! Get out! Koh... Get out of here! These are new samples we received. The flavouring effectively stimulates pet appetite. The added colour will appeal to pet owners. No good. We use only 100 percent natural ingredients. Pets suffer from allergies like human kids do. Our objective is to provide relief from that. Alright! Excuse me. Ma'am, call for you on Line 1. Who is it? Ministry of Foreign Affairs... Hello, this is Suzuki. Yes. Yes... So you're up? Sir, you can't interrogate him yet. There's something we need to make sure. Are you Japanese? Koh Suzuki? Your wife is Marie Suzuki, residing in Kamakura City, Kanagawa Prefecture, correct? You were used by the Chinese Mafia. Contact if his condition is changed. Why did you act like you didn't understand, in front of her? So, she wasn't your wife? If you aren't more aggressive, we'll destroy ourselves. It's alright, it's alright... Tokyo Public Prosecutor's Office. Mr. Koh Suzuki? Yes. You're suspected of Financial Exchange Law violation. We'll search your office. Verdict: The defendant is sentenced to 2 years in prison. However, imprisonment is suspended for 2 years from the sentencing date. I'm home. Welcome back. Want some? Sounds good. Alright... It's great how you never back down. And I love your sulkiness. Sorry... Hello? Why?! Why are you giving up?! Don't worry, I'll take responsibility if it fails. Don't play it safe, just get it done! Okay? Are you cut? Don't touch me! I love you even when you're mean. I loved you back then as you spoke of your new company, but love the present you even more. I'll accept you however you are. Oh, you're home? Don't push yourself, you're tired. I'm not tired. When founding our company, the head told me that I have remarkable stamina. Sit down. Dinner will be ready soon. I hate that. That you don't get tired. What...? I'm not your son. You don't have to look after me. Hey, did you feed Lettuce? Next we can write "Fall of the Prince of Finance." Sounds good, but first could you feed Lettuce? I hate cats! Yes. Yes, kill me. Go ahead! Kill me! Koh... In those days, we could communicate only with our bodies. We understood each other as lovers, more closely than anyone. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine. Thanks. Would you like to join us? Have a seat. Thanks. The staff who work here are excellent cooks. His Portuguese food is very nice, but today we have Sity's Malaysian food. You should try. That's nice. But be careful, it's a little bit spicy. Okay. Here you go. It's delicious! I'm glad to hear that. Thank you for everything. I haven't done much. No, that's not true. All I can do is to give morphine to the patients, but it's to relieve their pain, but there are a lot of patients out there who are suffering from very bad illness. Sometimes I feel like running away. How old are you? I'm 19. It's a Portuguese song. This area was once ruled by European countries. A lady's loved one went out to the sea, but never came back. This song is for him. Later, I saw a cross on a rock And your dark boat Dancing in the light I saw your arms waving Between the billowing sails On the beach the women say You will never return They're crazy! They're crazy! "You are in my heart." "You will never leave me." "Everyone says that you are always by my side." ♪ I know how deep my love i. ♪ You haven't really parted from me Someday, will I be able to love somebody like you do? Of course. Your heart is filled with love. I hope you can return to Japan together with him. Let's eat. I get breathless when I see Malaysian forests. Maybe I'm overwhelmed by the power of the nature. And your youth. He was singing a song. A Japanese song. I have to go back to Koh. Yeah. Do I look terrible? No, you look fine! Thanks. Excuse me, Ms. Rui Nakamura? Yes. I am Inoue, from the Japanese Consulate. Please wait! Don't tell me what to do. Koh Suzuki is my husband. Koh, you've suffered so much. You can't speak? From brain damage? No, but his mental state is fragile. But I came at Koh's request. They said he wanted to see me. Too bad you ended up like this. Let's talk outside. Mrs. Suzuki! When we were introduced while you were at the Financial Services Agency, I couldn't have imagined it would come to this. It's entirely her fault, right? Meeting Nakamura ruined your life, Koh. If you had remained with me, this wouldn't have happened. It's all your fault! Koh, you realize that now. That you lost everything because of her. Didn't you? You have to keep quiet in this situation, right? But as your wife, I know how you feel. You were a renowned publishing executive, with both status and financial means. What were you trying to get from Koh? Loving someone is not about getting something from them. You wanted him for erotic pleasure! That's the one thing you lacked. That is one aspect of our love. You shameless woman! You stayed with him after he was arrested and became a nobody because you didn't want to lose your erotic partner! When Koh realized that, he took off. Koh could stand being your erotic plaything! You could never know... how Koh and I loved each other, or how we still love each other even now. I do know. You came all the way here to say that? I know now that I've come. I knew when I saw what Koh has become. Please leave. No! You're the one leaving! Please leave! Excuse me. I'm going to roll the bed. Okay. We'll raise you. Are you okay? Now, I'm changing your bandage. Okay, I will clean up. Always best to have money. Thanks anyway. It's not my parent's money. I started my own business, selling natural pet foods. I made samples to take to pet shops all over Japan. Some shops were interested and accepted my products. This is all I can do for Koh now. Please take care of my husband. Mrs. Suzuki! Mrs. Suzuki... You'll burst a blood vessel. It's alright, everybody's doing this. Really? I'm letting go. Now... Let's do it again. Enough already. Come on... Don't want me to have your baby? Well, you know... Come on, come on... I have to work tomorrow, so we can't do it so many times. Marie left some money for you. Window... Window...? I'll open it. I want to see outside. I needed money for my dream. So I got involved in the China Fund. They threatened to kill you, if I betrayed them. So I had to leave Japan. You did it for me... I worked hard for them. But it's all over now, I'm of no further use, they'll kill me. This time, I'll protect you! We'll leave together after you recover a bit more. We can reach the border in half a day. You'll receive better medical care in Singapore. We can start over together. Let's run for it together. We'll never be parted. It's just as Marie said. You're too strong. Always so confident when saying you love me. I was fed up with that. What are you saying?! It would have ended between us even with no China Fund threat. I was fed up with your strength. Strength? What is strong about me? The way you are right now. It is true... that I was strong before we met. I had confidence in my career, and pride in my accomplishments. But my confidence and pride collapsed when... I fell in love with you, 17 years younger than me. Although I hadn't feared ageing at all, and had expected to live my life with pride, my age began to torment me. I was always afraid from the time we started living together. You always tried to anticipate things to avoid hurting me. I didn't leave for you, I ran away from you. I wanted to... escape from you. Ran away? How can you still care for me? I have nothing now, it's all over for me. I just want to die alone. She left. Do you pray to the west? Yes. Do you want to? I've no right to... I have used the money. You can keep the money. Please tell me about Yang. You know him, right? That song you were singing, did you learn it from Yang? Look at this. Rui... Rui. Thank you. Good boy, Lettuce. Did you say 'Lettuce'? Yes, his name is 'Lettuce.' Yang named it. Stop that! I said not to do that! Lettuce, your mum is scary. Lettuce... Please say he'll recover. Please say he'll recover! Please say... Please say he'll recover! Rui... Koh... Did that hurt? I want to hug you... Rui... One more time. Rui... You must never forget, that I will always love you, Rui. We can never conquer death. But we can... keep the memory of our loved one forever. And that... can be our little... victory over death. "Victory"? A perfect word for you, Rui.
