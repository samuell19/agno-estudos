You only come back for a few days, but you hardly stay at home. What have you been up to? Didi you check my phone? Why did you check my phone? Take this too. Don't touch the lock on the door. Is it stuck again? Damn! Mum. Excuse me. Step aside, please. - Have you contacted the family? - Not yet. - Tell the nurses' station when you do. - OK, i will. I'll have one later. - Have one now. - Later. Those clothes... Take them back and air them outside. Is Shun coming today? I think he's still in Shanghai. What's he getting up to? This kid... Mum (in a law), i have to go, i'm late for work. I'll be back later, OK? Alright. Don't forget to eat the grapes. Here, have a look. - What's this? - Dance lessons. - I'm off now. - Bye. Bye. - Dancing. - Oh. - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. I saw you and Bing... He doesn't want people to find out. You know what? I heard Ms Wang is leaving. So is Lily. Really? All these seniors leaving... I wonder why. Remember to watch this. Right, I'm Off. I missed my period again. And I felt dizzy a few days ago. - You missed your period? - Yes. - Dizzy? Cold sweats? - Yes. Those are probably menopausal symptoms. Menopause? You get mild fever and feel easily agitated, right'? Let's try some prescription drugs first. See if the symptoms improve. Come back when you finish the pills. But I'm only 45. Well, it happens to some even earlier. Alright, next. You've reached Shanghai Mobile Communication. The number you're calling is busy right now.

Sister (in law). - I thought you were in Shanghai. - I got back yesterday. And I'm going again in two days. I saw my brother when I was in Shanghai. He's doing alright now. Hows Mother now? The doctor needs the surgery consent form. She doesn't want the operation. How come'? Mum! Sister (in law). How are you'? Mum. If you don't have the operation, you won't be able to walk any more. It'll just get worse and worse. Where is the consent form? Ling. The boss wants to see you. What for? No idea. He didn't say. This is for you. I've chipped in an extra half on top of the total. My sons, they all want to go to China. They won't listen to me. Nowadays things are different. Everything relies on China. I'm retiring soon. By the way, the old sewing machines upstairs. I'll let you have one for free. Just ask someone to take it home for you. You've reached Shanghai Mobile... She just had her operation. The anaesthetic hasn't worn off yet. Don't give her any water until she passes wind. OK, thank you. Because the surgery was on her hip, try keeping her legs apart with a cushion. Nurse. That man is really noisy. I can't sleep virith that noise. Can you do something to keep him quiet? He is doing that unconsciously. There is nothing we can do. Poor man. No family here to take care of him. Try to get some rest. I'll check with the doctor. Hello, Mei Mei. I called you a few days ago. Hows everything in Taipei'? Yes. Grandma is not doing so well right now. Oh, is your dad coming back? I don't know. He didn't tell me. My phone is always on. Are you coming back this weekend? Women are worthless once they hit menopause. Even after 35, nobody wants you anymore. Shut up. No one asked for your opinion. If there was a man willing to touch me now, I'd pack my things and run off with him! What about your dance partner, Bing? He's long gone to China with the boss. Here, have some papaya. "Sweet fruit brings you a sweet son". Hell, there's no way I'd have a son at my age. You never know. - Do you still dance? - Of course. Better to have someone than no one. - Do you have a job now? - No. Come and see me at my dance club tomorrow. - What's it like? - Excuse me. Can I take a look at that pair? - Which pair? - The brown ones. - This? - Yes, thanks. What size do you wear, Ling? I don't know. Let me see. Probably seven. Use more stretchy cloth this time. Stretchy fabric... Make it around knee length. And some drapes. - Is this ok? - Yes, that's good. Here's your money. - That's too much. - Just take it. Do you want to join us? Alright then, I'll get back to it. See you later. Good day. Welcome to Shiseido. Take a flyer for information. There's a make-up demo. We can do your make-up for free. - That's ok, thank you. - Thank you and please come again. Good day, welcome to Shiseido. Take a flyer for information. Thank you. Mr Assistant Nurse. You've forgotten to give me the faecal and urinary record. Forget it again an i'll inform your supervisor. - I did it. - Did you? Yes, I gave it to Pei-wen. Where is it? I can't find it. I did it. Every time. Shift's over. Want to go to karaoke? Can you please be on time tomorrow'? - Who is he? - Assistant nurse. Always slacking off. I thought he was a handyman.

The ophthalmologist agreed to take off his eye patches. Sure. We'll take them off today. Thank you, Nurse. Bear with me. Mr Chang. You may slowly open your eyes. Mr Chang. Did you notice any hearing problems when you attended him'? Not really. Schedule a hearing test for him. No problem. Once he's able to see sunlight, he might brighten up a bit. That would help his recovery. Do arrange the hearing test ASAP. The sooner the better. What do you need? Open the window? It's a beautiful day today. I'll open the curtain. Let's take your temperature. Good. It's normal. Open!
