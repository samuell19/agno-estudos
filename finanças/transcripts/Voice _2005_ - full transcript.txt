- Hey, you scared me. - Look who's talking. I was recording you. Didn't you sing along? Why would I do that while recording? That's really odd. I bet you heard yourself. You think so? Anyway, why do you keep recording me? To make you a singer! Was that for music class? Yeah. But the high-pitched part isn't so easy. I can't believe how different you sound when you sing. It's good enough for me. Let's go now. Go ahead. I'll practice some more. For an hour and 28 minutes, I waited for you. I ditched the others so I could go with you. And I should go alone? Sorry, but I can't practice at home. What? Music is more important than me? It's your favorite song. I don't wanna ruin it. Okay then. We'll do the usual. The longer wins, okay? Okay. So lucky! Fine, I'll go. Sing your throat out for all I care! Good night, Sun-min. Sorry. Sun-min? You're still here? Who's there? Who is she? Why did she... VOICE Good morning. The First Day What's up? Wow, it looks expensive. How many megabytes? Come on, no megabytes. It's a gigabyte. It stores more than 100 songs? More than a thousand! - Mi-hee? - Finish your homework. Can't you see me? Can't you hear me? Hey! From here. Why can't you see me? Hey, this sucks. It has a lot of static. If you're lying, I'll kill you! I'm having a nightmare. I need to wake up. When I do, evertyhing will be fine. Sun-min! What? - Didn't you hear it? - No. Nothing. It's strange. I'm sure I heard a scream. No way. - Good morning! - Hi! Did you see Young-eon this morning? I don't think so. Teacher! It's me, Young-eon. It's me, Young-eon. Can't you hear me? Teacher? Please, say something. Teacher? Teacher? Okay, I understand. Sure. Thanks. What is it, Sun-min? Young-eon's absent today. And she's not answering her phone. Ijust talked to her dad. Today's a memorial day for her mom. She might've gone to her grave. Why didn't she tell me? They don't live together? They do. But he often goes away on business. - So... - Hey, KIM! Come here for a sec. - Good morning - Hi, Sun-min. Are you date with your teacher? How's it going? Sun-min... Damn... - I'll go. - Sure. Seated before the damn mixer You can't swear on air, can you? I'm editing you out! Who has this beautiful voice? It's Kang Sun-min, the announcer! Sun-min, how are you? My best friend is absent without telling me. Thus, I'm in a bad mood. Hi! Is evertyhing okay? Cue! "If I don't read daily, thorns grow on my tongue. " Hi, this is SWB lunch broadcast on November 25. What does reading have to do with thorns? I always wondered. Here's the answer. Thorns refer to bad words. If I don't listen to music daily, my ears go weird. I've been hearing things all this morning. So let's listen to one now. I can't get used to my voice on speakers. Everybody thinks they sound different on speakers, though it's the same voice. The voice I hear is different from the one that others hear... That's creepy. Right. When I first heard my voice on speakers, - it was weird. - Yours is naturally weird. Let's go. Sun-min? Kang Sun-min? What? Nothing. Kang Sun-min? Sun-min! Can you hear me? What's this? Is this a joke? It's me, Young-eon. I'm standing right beside you. Sun-min? What's with the sound? - Are you okay? - Be careful! - Is she okay? - What's wrong with her? You might've heard things due to severe stress. Try to get some sleep. Young-eon's absent one day, and you hear things? - Leave so she can rest. - Okay. Don't cry. Bye. I'm sorry, Sun-min. I couldn't help it. You're the only one who can hear me. Don't be scared. It happened last night after you left. I should've left with you. Maybe this is punishment. Sun-min... It's me, Young-eon. I would send you a message on your cell after the broadcast. You would wait for me when I practiced singing. Sun-min... Sun-min... It's your favorite song. I can't open my eyes. What if I open them and you're not there? I can't. What's word... I believe you're Young-eon. But I can't believe you're dead. I'm talking to you now. Except that you're invisible, nothing has changed. I have no idea what's happened to me. - She's talking to herself. - What's wrong with her? Young-eon? I don't know how to accept this. - I know you're far more... - Sun-min! I can't leave the building. We can talk freely here. There's nobody but us. You're beside me, right? Yes, right beside you. Who was it? Did you see her face? No. I remember passing out in front of the elevator. But that's about it. That's right! I saw someone last night, leaving the music room. The music teacher! It had to be her. You're suspecting her? No way. She was so nice to me. Exactly! Almost too nice. No. She would never... I'd be damned. Where's the damn leak? The building is new outside, but rotten inside. Teacher, Young-eon is absent today. See? What'd I tell you? Listen. Of the notes you just heard, pick one and copy it. Stop. What'd we just hear? Noises. You. You. You... You... Do the same notes again. Okay, begin. Stop. If the notes don't go together, they're only noises. But if they do, they become a beautiful chord. Listening to the sound is more important than singing well. You should be able to tell which sound goes well with which. Otherwise, they're noises. Like human relationships. See what I'm getting at? That's what we're doing from now on. Sleeping during class Snoring like crazy Swinging the stick in his hand Hitting students for fun No help for helping students Too lazy to teach You lazy bastard I thought of a place that makes constant noises. And this is it. The boiler room. It's the heart of our school. - You hear the heart beating? - It's spooky. The music teacher is so cool. Don't get too close to her. Are you jealous? A little bird told me she's a lesbian. - Really? - I don't know if it's true. I feel sorry for her. Why? I heard that larynx cancer had ruined her soprano career. She's able to talk now, but can't sing any more. If she pushes for it, she might lose her voice. That's terrible. This is my favorite. I can't believe you still have that. It was your present. Listening to music on it, I can feel your presence. Young-eon, don't overdo it. Teacher? Do you know where Young-eon is? Why ask me that? I thought you might know. Young-eon? What are you doing here? A voice seems to be heard here. So I dropped by. You hear it? That voice? It's time for dogs and wolves. Dogs and wolves? When the sun sets, you can't tell if it's a dog or a wolf from a distance. That's what it means. It's time for the truth to be hidden. Or the other way around. Mom. I'll get a driver's license as soon as I graduate. So I can drive you to Chuncheon, where we went long ago. You know what it means? You have to get better. You know what? You smell like my mom. Hey, she's at it again. I'm scared. I'll tell Mom I'm sleeping over at your place. Who was that for? For our lovely school, of course. She's officially insane. Yeah, it's pretty bad. - Look. - What? Don't you know her from middle school? - Cho-ah? - Yes. - What's she like? - She's a freak. She took a year off in middle school. It was her head that was wrong, not her body. - Her head? - She was in a nuthouse. No, it can't be. Sun-min! Young-eon, did you scream? What's wrong? I think something happened to the music teacher. Sun-min, I'm scared. Let's get out of here. What's it doing here? It's the music teacher. Something's not right. Sun-min? What happened? Talk to me, Detective. You okay? The Second Day Shocking news! What's the bustle? You're not gonna believe what I heard. The music teacher killed herself last night. Is that true? If it's a lie, you're dead. You're too doubtful for a Christian. I saw it coming. Yesterday, that cello sounded like "Good bye, Students. " I wonder why she did it. Maybe she got knocked up? I mean that's a taboo. Get real. You're so dumb. She was a lesbian. She's absent again? You know what? They say the music teacher and her were lovers. It must be true. No way. What's up with her? Is Young-eon dead? What makes you think that? I heard the voice too. I started hearing voices when I was little. And I found out later that they were from the dead. If you thought she was dead, why did you keep quiet? Because it's not my business. I think she played it for herself. Yeah, I think so. But why? Why'd she listen to this before killing herself? I like the song. The song? What song? I only hear the cello. There's someone else! Let's talk. We need to talk! Go ahead. Did you hear it before Young-eon disappeared? The voice? I think so. - Whose voice was it? - I don't know. How you hear her voice... Aren't you curious? A ghost can have a voice with a strong attachment. So it can talk to the living. Like you and Young-eon. But... If forgotten, the ghost loses its voice. If you forget her, she'll become unseen and unheard. Is the icicle a life form? No, it's not. It doesn't perform life-sustaining activities. It doesn't eat or excrete like we do, although it grows and dies. So it's not a life form. I need someone to sing on my behalf. Who do you recommend? Okay, I'll pick one then. Teacher? I recommend Park Young-eon. - Go ahead. - I can't - No, she's joking. - Come on. Young-eon, come up here and sing for us. Go Young-eon! She's been around us. For a long time. I think she sang the song from the CD. Say she did this to you, but why? What if I did her harm? No way. You're too nice for that. What if she was jealous of your singing voice? You told me she was watching you sing. Is my singing voice that good? Of course. It was more than being good. I recorded your song so I could play it for the lunch broadcast. As my present to you. I'm sorry. Do you think my mom became like me? I have her picture at home. She's smiling brightly in it. She's so beautiful in that picture. Is she? I'd like to see her picture. Didn't you see it when you came over? Hey. I've never been to your place. Really? Not even once? You never invited me. Can't you hear it? No. I hear nothing. I do. It's from the hallway. Some kind of humming. It's going away. Young-eon? Young-eon! Young-eon? I hear something. It's like a human voice. But I'm not sure. But I don't hear anything. What's happening? Talk to me! It's coming nearer. What's coming? Someone's coming! Stop it! You're scaring me! I'm sorry, Sun-min. It's my fault. You won't leave me, will you? Without you, I will disappear. The Third Day You look tired. What do you care? It's not your business. I'll make it mine. If Young-eon is dead, where's her body? I don't think she's dead. What then? I'm not sure. But she's not dead. Fine. What does she remember before she became whatever she is? She passed out in front of the elevator. And when she came to, there was nothing. Better not believe every word she says. The ghost remembers only what it wants to. So you're saying... The music teacher and Young-eon were lovers. The word got out. So they killed themselves. - Is that it? - That's right. Everybody knows that. It's almost a fact. Hye-sun! Did you see Young-eon kill herself? What am I, a security camera? Then keep your mouth shut. That bitch! Sun-min? Kang Sun-min? What's wrong? No, it's nothing. What'd Cho-ah tell you? Nothing much. I don't like her. Don't get too close to her. Whom I make friends with... I need your permission? Sun-min! You talk to yourself now? Sun-min? - Hi. - Who could've imagined she was a lesbian? No wonder she turned me down. I should've known better. So this isn't the first time a suicide happened here? A student named Hyo-jung. She killed herself too. Yeah? - How'd she do it? - That's... Let me tell you. Where she died... It's right here. - What? - In this elevator. Damn! He wants to see my mom. I'm in trouble. - What happened? - Stay back. You're not gonna believe this. Young-eon is dead! - What? - She's dead! She should've done it at home. Why the fuck at school? Still, thanks to her, no night study tonight. Stop pulling me. What the fuck! You're dead, bitch! Sun-min! Like you said, her memory isn't correct. I've never been to her place. She said she'd passed out in front of the elevator. But... Something's wrong. I feel so strange with her. Let's go today. To her place. What? Nothing. Sun-min? Sun-min, is that you? It isn't you that she likes. It's the same singing voice she's lost. So please. Stay away from her. She's all I have. Why should I care? When'd you and Young-eon become friends? The day after her mom committed suicide. Her mom got sick when she was in 3rd grade. She'd looked after her mom since then. She must've felt sorry for her daughter. She jumped out of the window at the hospital. As I learned that her daughter was in our class, we became friends. Sympathy turned into friendship? Not exactly. I respected the fact that she was coping with the hardship so well. But now, I couldn't be more confused. I thought I knew her. But I'm not sure how much I knew her. Honestly, I'm scared. Seeing her body... Hearing her voice when nobody else can... It scares me. What's holding her back is... It's you. It's time you let her go. So she can rest in peace. The Fourth Day The purpose of life is pursuing happiness. That means working hard. By working hard, we achieve satisfaction. Sun-min? Thus, happiness comes from having a good job. Sun-min? What are the requirements to have a good job? Health, good credit, sociability... Sun-min? Talk to me. Please, say something. Sun-min? - You asked to borrow this. - Thanks. Play the first track, will you? - What is it? - Just play it. This is SWB lunch broadcast on November 28. Yesterday... My precious friend left for the other world. Though she's gone, all the precious moments that we laughed and cried together... They're buried in my heart like a book of poems. Though we're apart, I hope she's happy wherever she is. Let me play a song. One that my friend sang. Sun-min! It's me, Young-eon. Can't you hear me? Sun-min, please. Answer me. My singing voice is the same as hers. Please. Check it out for me. I can't disappear like this without knowing why I died. Why do you need the file on Hyo-jung? To confirm something. I know it's here. Oh, it's right here That's Hyo-jung. She has the same singing voice as Young-eon's. Like Young-eon, she sang on behalf of the music teacher. Hyo-jung... liked her a lot. Almost too much. As the rumor spread throughout the school, her classmates gave her a hard time openly. Then one day, she was found dead in the elevator. That's all I know about her. Because of the teacher, she could have a voice after death. Like I do now. As the teacher took interest in me, she started losing her voice and killed me. And the teacher killed herself out of guilt. Why are you so quiet? Is it my voice? What is it? Say something. I'm just tired. - Of what? - Evertyhing. Even if she killed you, it doesn't make a difference. It's not gonna bring you back. Do you wanna leave me? I think I'm losing my voice. I'm scared of what's coming. But you can't stay here for good. Bye. Were you with Young-eon? Leave me alone, will you? No! Don't do it, Hyo-jung. Leave her out of this. It's me that you want! Isn't that Young-eon's voice? Damn, who's playing? How is that possible? The electricity is out. Sun-min! Are you okay? You have to go now. You killed Mom! - That's not true. - You were tired of her. You were disgusted with the hospital smell. Not to mention the bills piling up. You didn't care how the surgery went. You just wanted her dead. No! No... You're making it up. I loved her. So I stayed with her all the way. Stop lying to yourself. You knew evertyhing. That you killed Mom. That you'd been hearing Hyo-jung's voice. Stay away from her. She's all I have. If she forgets me, I will disappear. On hearing her voice, you felt a sense of betrayal against the teacher. So you punished her. Go on. I wanna hear you sing. Please. Sing for me. Teacher. Sing for me. Please. You know what? You smell like my mom. My dead mom! I'll never sing again for you. I know that there's another voice beside mine. No... It's a lie! You're not me. You can't deceive me. You're Hyo-jung. You made all this up! She no longer exists. When you killed the teacher, she disappeared. I did? I killed the teacher? You made me what I am. It's your fault. Hyo-jung and I are dead because of you. You killed her to seek revenge on Hyo-jung. You knew she'd disappear if the teacher died. When Sun-min forgets you, you'll end up like her. The Last Day I haven't heard her voice all day. You think she's gone? Mom, I don't know who I am. What should I do? I've been able to talk to Sun-min. But if I lose my voice... What am I gonna do? - You said last time? - When I... - You wanna buy something? - Yes. You don't have lunch-broadcast. "Whipped by the harsh season, they were in despair. " Excuse me. I'm here to pick up a desk. Sure, it's that one. I can't believe you still have that. It was your present. Listening to music on it, I can feel your presence. It's your favorite song. I don't wanna ruin it. Young-eon, are you here? Where are you? I'm sorry. I won't forget you. I'll always be with you. Answer me! Young-eon... Sun-min... Why are you looking for Sun-min? Anything left you want from her? What do you want? My voice. I want my voice back. So I can talk to Sun-min. No! What is it you really want? I know what it is. You want to live. To live? To live... Young-eon? Young-eon? Sun-min? Sun-min? Sun-min? A month later She'd been staying at a nursing home. I see. How are you? Much better. The school wasn't the same without your lunch broadcast. I feel so terrible for those girls. Both Young-eon and Cho-ah... It's been a while. Sun-min. I love you. Mom. I'll get a driver's license as soon as I graduate. When I do, I'll drive you to Chuncheon.
