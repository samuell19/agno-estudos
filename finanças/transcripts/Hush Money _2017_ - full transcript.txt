But look, change of plans alright, something's come up, can't make it today alright? Really sorry. Forget the money, forget my cut alright? That is hilarious man, I'm fucking dying on the inside man. The Mancini's are not playing. You understand I need this money. Yeah I know, I know mate alright. I'm sorry, this deal just got a lot more complicated and I can't leave alright. I'll tell you what, I'm gonna call him, see if I can get you an extension or something alright? Naw man they're not gonna give me another extension, dude they want their money today. Today before the sun drops that's what he said. Before the sun drops? I mean that's what he said, those exact words? Yes, those exact words. Yeah alright, bring the girl to your house, hold her there until I'm done alright and then I'll come meet you. You want me? Man fuck you Chuck! Please I can't breathe, I can't breathe. Hey, hey you're gonna get us killed. Your name's Kennedy right? My name is Doug. Yeah, I couldn't tell. I mean this when I say this okay, I want you to sleep in your own bed tonight. K, I want to sleep in my own bed too. Buy you have got to cooperate, you cannot pull that shit you pulled earlier, you understand me? There's a cop that's following us. I think he might pull me over. Where do you normally get your prescriptions, your inhalers? Scales. Scales, what is that? Scales, it's a pharmacy downtown. Downtown? Alright, whatever. Look I'm gonna get you that inhaler alright, get up off the floor. Not too fast, alright just keep your head down. Good. Now lay your head on that seat right there. Now if he pulls me over, you don't do anything stupid you understand alright? You just let me do the talking, and you just try to get your breathing under control. If you try anything I'm pulling this trigger and somebody's going to die. And the cop, he might have a family. Now you have a family, I've got a family. I've got a family. If you so much as blink the wrong way, somebody's not going to see their family tonight and that's on you, you understand me? Alright Doug you can do this. Do you have my money? You're not getting shit you inbred bastard. Let me talk to my fucking daughter. Shit. Get your hands out of your pants and put my daughter on the damn phone. No we talk money first. Oh fuck you, I ain't talking shit with you. Okay, thank you for calling. License please. Yeah, what's the problem. You were driving awful damn fast. Yeah just trying to... Douglas Shaw. Didn't I just see you at the warehouse? I have no idea what you're talking about. A few minutes ago I saw a car that looks just like this. No. It wasn't me. Is she okay? Yeah no it's fine it's my daughter, that's what I'm trying to tell you. I was on my way to her school to take her and then this started happening just started having trouble breathing you know. You know I can give you an escort to the hospital you don't have to drive like that. No no no, I can't afford an ER visit, it's way too expensive. If I just get her home, we've got an inhaler. Once we get that it clears right up. We just gotta get home that's all. Well I'm gonna have to write you a citation. Yeah I understand. Anytime you're going more than 10 over the limit we're gonna pull you over. Okay yeah I got it. You take care of her. I will thank you. Sorry about that, like I said I'm in a hurry. Just trying to get her home. Thanks again officer. What's your date of birth? Come on you gotta try and tell me. One, four. Okay, okay. Okay hang in there alright, I'll be right back. - I - can help who's next. Hey. How are you doing today? I'm good thank you, I just need to get an inhaler for Kennedy Joseph. Sure do you have a Scales loyalty... No I don't, I'm really in a hurry. I can save you five percent... I really just need to get the inhaler please. Date of birth? It's January 4th, 2003. - Same insurance as before? - Yeah. Hold on. It says you're early on your refill Mr. Joseph. You're not due for another month. Yeah she lost the other one, you know kids. K. The total is 21.58. That's 20, it's all I got. The total is 21.58. Listen I got Kennedy out in the car right now, she's having an asthma attack, I really just need to get this. I'm sorry to hear that. If you need to use the phone to call an ambulance. She'll be dead before they get here. Listen, I can come back later okay, I'll come back, I'll give you the dollar 58. I just really need to get this now. You gotta be kidding me, fuck this. Really? This is how you treat a kid that's almost died? Unbelievable. I don't need your attitude alright, I just saved your life. Oh, thank you mister kidnapper. Thanks for saving my life. You really see nothing wrong with that? Hello? Hi I'm just letting you know... Help, help! Hang on for me one second just. Somebody help! Hey. What's that screaming in the background? Screaming? Yeah it sounds like somebody's yelling. Um, oh yeah no no, that's a customer you know, complaining about their service. It just seems like every car in the city's having problems today. Anyways what's up? So did you figure anything out? You mean for the house? Yeah the house. I'm doing everything that I can, what are you doing? I'm working, and I'm trying to sell these paintings and stuff. Doug, you make nine dollars an hour. And we actually lost money at that art show last month. Okay, I mean what do you want me to do, I'm trying everything here, you know. - I - don't know anymore. I don't think you're trying hard enough. I talked to Chelsea today, do you remember Chelsea? Yeah, with freckles. Yeah. Well, her husband Paul manages a large hedge fund and he's actually looking for an assistant. They said you don't need any experience. They could get you in for an interview, like right away. What do you think? Rebecca, we've tried this before. You know I don't do good in a tie. Okay but come on, it could be different this time. It's gotta be better than trying to be the oil changing Picasso. Yeah is there anything else, 'cause I gotta go. No, I'll just see you at home. Yeah. What the hell is wrong with you screaming like that? What am I supposed to do, just sit here and wait for you to rape and kill me? What? Why do you think? What kind of person do you think that I am? Uh a kidnapper. I'm not, listen I don't, I don't, just shut up man! Well what are you gonna do when my mom doesn't give into your demands? That's your mother. A mother will do anything for their child right? You've never met Olivia Joseph. I'm surprised she's not on Baseball Wives or something. She'd give me up in a second. If it meant she could continue to buy Prada. Okay. We'll see. It looks absolute puke, no way. What? Do you have my money? You are as dumb as you sound using that bullshit accent. Let me speak to my daughter. There will be plenty of time to speak to your daughter. Once I get my money. Fucking idiot, I already told you I'm not pay... That was good, that was really good, really believable I mean the squirming, everything it was really good. Whatever it takes, I just want this nightmare to end. What did my mom say? She's gonna give me the money. Really? What are still doing here, just take me to her. You'll get the money. It's not that simple okay? I'm gonna need a minute, I just need a minute to think, okay I just gotta think. So what are you gonna do? Where'd you get those? Don't worry about it. Yeah. Hey, I got a package for a Douglas Shaw. Who's it from? I don't know I just need you to sign for it. It's Alfonzo Mancini. If I can just get you to sign for it. Why were you looking through my window? I was just making sure anybody wasn't home before I take it back to base. Open it. Actually I can't open it, you have to sign for it. Just open the package. If you sign for it, you can do whatever you want to with this package. Open it. No, I'm not gonna open it. If I can just get you to sign for the. Yeah, it's that kind of day. Look man, there's has got to be something we can work out. Just let me go man, you don't need me. I'm not even a part of this, I don't even know who Alfonzo is. Just let me go, you can trust me. Look at me, look. Shut up. But bro, whatever you're doing here. You got me in these sheets man. Look, Doug, it's Doug, Doug, Doug, look, I got a brother named Doug. I don't even know this little girl. I don't care about here. I've never seen her in my life. I won't even see her, I won't even see you again Doug, just let me go. Look I never saw you man, I don't even know who you are. Just cut me, just let me loose, and you'll never see me again. I'll just say I lost the package. You there? Look I don't even want this job man. I tried to quit last week. You'll never see me again I promise you. I don't even remember this house. Doug just let me go, yes, just cut me, let me, and then I'll be gone I promise. Promise, just cut, just don't, don't. I said shut up. Doug. This is your fault. What ever. I just really have to use the bathroom. Are we seriously on that shit again? Naw, you go in your pants. Seriously? On your dining room chair, your kitchen floor? I didn't think you were one of those. No, I'm not okay, I'm gonna turn around that's fine. Would you just hurry up and don't try anything. So, what are you gonna do with him, and how are you gonna get the money. What do you care? I care because I want to go home. And the sooner you get what you want. I'm gonna have her put the money in a trash can out in a public place, and then I'm gonna go get it when the coast is clear. Seriously, that's got to be the dumbest plan ever. How much money are you asking for anyway? Would you just hurry up, I thought you had to go. Um, this is embarrassing, I can't go with you in here. You're gonna need to figure it out, just let it flow. But I gotta number two. Okay, I'm gonna wait outside alright, you've got five minutes. Okay let's go, come on let's go, times up. Come on time's up. Hey, let's go. Oh shit. No no no no. Shit! Yeah. I know you got my gift. Yeah. It's just a reminder. Tell me Doug, is this gonna be a good day, or a bad day. Listen I'm working on getting the money today okay? I'm gonna get it today. Today, that's good, because that's all you got. You know my number. Call me when you get the money, and I'll tell you where the drop is. Okay, I'll call you as soon as I get it. I know, because if I have to call you again, it's too late. Before the sun drops Doug. Help, is anybody home, help me! You've gotta help me please, you've got to help me. Yes, how can I help you? Please, ma'am please help. No that's fine, my daughter and I are having a bit of a family dispute. You had me so worried, don't ever... This man is not my father. He's kidnapped me. Why would you say something like that, listen. You know kids these days right, I'm sorry that we brought our family drama to your doorstep. Do you know that you're bleeding? Please, you've got to help me. That doesn't look good, you should come in I can help you, I used to be a nurse. No, no no, it's fine, I was working I slipped. Or the delivery guy just kicked your ass. What did I tell you about talking like that. Listen, no I'm sorry, we need to go. No, no, wait. You two seem pretty rattled. I think maybe you should stay with me for awhile, you could take a walk, calm down, and when you get back, the two of you could work through it. That sounds like a great idea. No, with all due respect, I don't know you. I'm not very comfortable leaving my daughter alone with you. Okay but I could call the police. This does look rather concerning, or the two of you could come in and discuss it over tea like civilized people. Plus I will get a chance to practice my stitching. Now don't be rude, I insist. Yeah, Dad don't be rude. Come on in, it's fine. Ma'am I really need to use the phone. Now don't mind my son, he works nights. Catches naps when he can. This man... Just sit down and shut up. Oh I'll just be right there. Okay, alright here we go now. Now I'll see if I can get that closed up. Seriously I need to use your phone. Now where did I leave that sewing kit. Boy you two look like you've had a rough day. Ma'am listen, we'd really rather just take our little disagreement somewhere else. No no, you go ahead and drink up. Calm down, work through it. But ma'am please. Would you stop it. Listen you gotta trust me okay? I need this. I'm not gonna hurt you. But I need this. Understand me? I'm not gonna hurt you. Just sit down. Drink your tea and we'll get out of here okay. I promised you that you're gonna sleep in your own bed tonight and I meant that. Please. Your Dad makes millions, he's not gonna miss it, but I need this. I need this. You and your little girl having some trouble? Ma always gets the iced tea out when there's trouble. I'm Ray by the way. Little bit of trouble yeah, but we'll be okay. That's good. I have a little girl too. She's sick though. You gotta cherish the moments you got. And just... Well I found the sewing kit, there we are. Let's get you over on the sofa so we can get you stitched up yes that's it, right there's good, oh perfect. Alrighty then, let's see. Let me get you a little lump here. Now when I get the needle out I need you to hold really still. Now when I get this needle up near your eye I need you to hold really still. I haven't done this too much lately, so my hands aren't quite as steady as they used to be but we'll get you all stitched up. Yes. There we go. All better. Yes. Ow. You gotta be kidding me. Did you take care of the other one? Just gonna do it tonight. I want you to take this bag down and put it in the icebox. In a minute Mom. Think this is gonna work? I sure hope so, we can't keep doing this. Hurry up Ma, get the stuff. What are you doing, let me go. Let me go. What is this. Calm down little one, just calm down. It's alright, just calm down, stay still. Calm down, now calm down. Whatever the hell you think you're doing, you're gonna stop it right now. Untie her let her go. Calm down this will only take a minute. No shut the fuck up and untie her now. Listen I have a little girl. I don't give a shit! You guys are fucking sick. Untie her now! Hurry up. What am I supposed to do? No! You think you're better than me? You don't think I heard about you kidnapping her and shit? You ain't no better than me, you ain't no better than me! Get down! At least someone's day's getting better. Not again. This being tied down to a chair is a little much right now. It's bad enough that I'm wearing this. One or two? One. So, are you gonna go after him? I don't have time to roam the streets looking for a delivery guy. Last time I took a drink from a stranger. Just drink it. Look you look weak, I don't know how much blood they took from you. Exactly why I think this being tied down thing is a little much right now. Those people were crazy. You don't know the half of it. It's a hell of a day we're having. They're just trying to save their little girl. You really need that money, don't you? Why? Owe money to the wrong people. Wrong people? There's a rumor about the guy that I owe money to. The rumor is that he once cut a guys thumbs off because that guy owed him 50 bucks. I owe him a lot more than 50 bucks. You know its easy to borrow money. And some people make it easier than others, but it is never that easy to pay it back. I just lost my job. I was an art teacher at Metro. Teachers don't make shit but it was a job. At least I still got to be involved in art. And then they cut the program. One thing led to another and things just started piling up. We got behind, and things just start to get so heavy that, just feels like you're drowning. That asshole I was talking to earlier, he introduced me to some people. I borrowed some money. And I thought I could improve my situation by gambling it. God I was stupid. The winning, winning felt like hope. I lost more than I won though. But it always felt like that next win was right around the corner. In fact if, if your dad hadn't have missed that fly ball in the divisional series we wouldn't even be here right now. Robbing Peter to pay Paul is never a good situation to be in. Anyways I wouldn't expect a spoiled little rich girl like you to understand. So, you blame my dad for everything? No, it just kind of happened this way. Hell of a coincidence though. Is it hard for you? Your dad gone so much? It's not about how much time I get with him, it's about the type of time I get with him, the quality, quantity thing. About fucking time. I was just getting ready to call the cops on your kid snatching ass. What took you so long. Your patience has saved your daughter from much harm. I am ready to make exchange. Before I give you a dime of my husband's money, I want to know she's okay. Mom. Are you hurt? I hope to got he hasn't touched you. No it's not like that. What the hell, do you have any idea how shitty my day's been? City park, put the money in a black duffle bag and hid it discreetly in one of the trash cans there. If anything fishy goes down, you can explain to your husband why you'll never see your daughter again. You've got one hour. How am I supposed to get that much cash in an hour. You've had all day, I'm sure you'll figure something out. I'm surprised she's actually going through with it. Seems like the prime opportunity to get rid of me and not have it be her fault. Why would your mom want to get rid of you? She's not my real mom. Where's your real mom? Never really met her, perks of being spoiled rich kid. It's a beautiful painting, your daughter? Yeah. That's how I still see her. She's a little younger than you are. I remember every brush stroke. I remember every detail, every mistake. I remember every day I spent trying to get it just right. What's her name. Sophia, she's the best thing that ever happened to me. I paint to, it's nothing as good as this though. My style's more abstract, kind of like Guston meets neo-impressionism. You know Guston? Yeah, my favorite of his is Smoking, Painting, Eating. It's a little out there but I like it. Yeah I like that one, I like that one. Do you know Couple in Bed? What, Couple in Bed, no I don't think if seen that one. You don't know Couple in Bed, oh my god. It's a statement, a statement about the strains he put on his marriage as he was trying to balance his career as an artist with dealing with financial hardships. Wow I get it, the paint brushes, wearing his shoes in bed. He probably made a fortune on that one. I doubt it. You sell your work? I try. There's just not many people lining up to but art from an unknown painter. You know my wife says that if I put half the energy that I do into my art, into a real job, I could actually make something out of myself. She just, she just doesn't get it you know, she just doesn't understand. Sounds like my mom. Your wife and her should get an apartment together? Apartment? Meaning that they're similar, they have a knack for tearing people down. Nevermind, can you move me closer to your painting? Yeah. Your wife may not understand it but I do, I get it. You should work harder to sell your paintings. You're kind of a genius. I bet people would pay a lot for something like this. People don't pay for art anymore. Everybody expects it free on the internet or something. Music, movies, beautiful abstract desktop wallpaper, nobody pays for that shit. Besides I don't think my wife would be okay with me sitting around painting all day while she works at a quote unquote real job. What does she do? She's a nurse. Ugh I hate nurses. Hey hey man I think you got my bag. I don't think so. No no no did you find it in that trashcan over there? Listen a friend of mine left it for me over there. What kind of friends you got dude? Finders keepers, losers weepers. You better start weeping buddy. Don't play games with me man I'm having a really bad day. I'm having a really bad day too mother fucker, but you're gonna a lot worse day if your fucking with me. Okay wait wait, do you even know what's in this bag? Do you even know what's in this bag? I don't give a fuck. Listen I'm gonna take this motherfucker over to Garbles, I'm gonna sell this motherfucker, sell the shit in it, for 50 bucks. Okay, okay okay, I get it, 50 bucks. I'll give you a hundred bucks. I'll give you a hundred bucks right now, just give me the bag. Alright a hundred bucks right now mother fucker, man up, man up, man up. Okay, no no no, you give me the bag and then I'll pay you. You think I was born yesterday? Just give me the fucking bag and I'll pay you! Okay look look, just look. Look in the bag. Look in the bag okay. Look in the bag and I'll pay you okay? Holy shit. No listen to me I need this fucking money! Hey. So when were you gonna tell me Doug? Tell you what? I've been trying to call you, why haven't you been answering your phone? I'm busy, I'm at work. Work, stop fucking lying to me. I tried your cell, then I called your work and they told me you were fired a month ago. I just don't even care any more to be honest. Look, Sophie's not at school, is she with you? No, Sophia's not with me. She was there earlier, I dropped her off like I always do. Look so, they haven't called you at all? Nope. So you have no idea where my fucking child is. You are such a fuck up I am going to the school. Come on come on. We're sorry, this mailbox is full. Shit! We're sorry, this mailbox is full and cannot take new messages. So, I guess the plan worked? You didn't kill anyone did you? You think I killed somebody? I don't know, you carry that gun around, you come back covered in blood. It's been a crazy day, I don't know what... Take it. Pull the trigger. Stop it what are you doing? Pull the trigger. Stop! You think I'm some kind of pedophile kidnapping murderer, then you can end this okay. Pull the fucking trigger! No stop it. I said pull the fucking trigger! Do it again. You see? It's fake. It's all fake. We're sorry, this mailbox is full. I didn't kill anybody, okay alright? I hurt him, alright, I hurt him really bad. But he had something that could make my piece of shit life just a little bit better. You see this, I don't give a fuck about this! I don't give a shit about, all I want is for my daughter to be safe, and for my wife not to have to worry about money, and bills and shit. I don't give a fuck about this! Pick up the god damn phone. Hello, Doug? Doug? Hey man listen, I've been trying to call you, I got your money. Did you take my daughter? Hey man I hate to do it but it was for insurance purposes. You know how that goes, but you got the money, that's good. Bring it down to Astorians, down on Broadway. And I'll have one of my guys drop your little girl off. No no no Alfonzo listen to me, I got your money. I did, I got it, but I can't get it to you right now. I need you to come and get it. It's here, it's at my house, it is on my living room floor okay? Doug that's not the deal, you got to bring it to me. You still got to get it before the deadline. I suggest you hurry though. Yeah no no... Doug. Douglas Shaw, open up! Douglas Shaw, come out or we're coming in. Did you actually think that would work? Destroying the tracker? Just a heads up, we got snipers. Listen, I've had a rough week and I don't want the amount of paperwork that comes along with a dead suspect. Douglas Shaw! Are you gonna answer the door? Boy you've been busy today. Kidnapped the daughter of Francisco Joseph, abduct an assault a career delivery driver, not to mention beat a man half to death in city park? - Oh there are... - Who is this? Oh, I apologize let me introduce myself. Agent Shawn Wallace, FBI. Fuck. You've got 15 seconds to surrender! Just let me go Doug. If you come in here, I will slit this girl's throat! You will not fuck with me! I'm gonna let this one slide. You know, you're stressed, I get it. No, you don't get it. This is how this is gonna work. I have this girl, and as long as I have this girl, you assholes aren't gonna do shit. Do you understand? If you try anything, I will shoot her. Or I will cut her so so bad, do you understand me Wallace? Proof of life. I need to know that you haven't hurt her already. Hello? Are you hurt? No I'm okay. She's good, and if you want her to stay good, you will do exactly what I say. What do you want Doug? Safe passage. I'm taking the girl out of here. And when I get to my destination, I will call you and I will give you my wear abouts so you can pick her up. So I'm just supposed to let you go. What other choice do you have. Well I could send a few of my best men in through the front door, guns blazing and when the smoke clears we can see who's left standing. Yeah, you gonna put the girl in that kind of risk? Well not my first choice. But if you're going to force my hand. I'm leaving Wallace, and I'm taking the girl with me and there ain't shit you can do about it. The last thing you want is Kennedy Joseph's face splattered all over the evening news dead because you got a little too prideful. Come on, let's go. Where, where are we going? We have to get the money to these guys okay? Just don't do anything stupid? You think I'm stupid, is that what you think? You think I'm dumb? I have a plan okay. I had a better fucking plan than this one, but you're right, it's stupid. All of it, but what am I gonna do? Huh? What am I supposed to do, they got my little girl! They have her, and they are gonna kill her, do you understand. They are gonna kill her and I can't let that. Let her go! Back up! Let her go! Back the fuck up! Doug you're making a mistake! Just let the girl go. Back off! Let go of the girl. I'm not letting her go! Get out of my fucking way! I said move! Yeah alright there Doug. Sorry about the fuck up there earlier mate. I managed to get everything sorted out. So if you want to meet up now, I can let you in the spot alright? You're making it worse for yourself, let the girl go and step out of the car. This isn't going to end well. Doug let the girl go. Stop please, they aren't just gonna let us leave. No no no no listen to me. I got the money. Doug, the sun is down. I'm a business man, and I gotta do things right. Don't worry about the money, your debt is paid now. No, no Alfonzo listen to me, I got the fucking money okay. I just need a little more time. I'm sorry Doug, I really am, but you're not here. I gotta be a man of my word. A deals a deal. But Doug, I want you to know that I made sure it was quick, she didn't feel nothing. I'm sorry. No, no Alfonzo you listen to me! I got your fucking money okay! I got the money I just need more time please! Please, please Alfonzo, you can't fucking do this! No no no! The number you have reached, has been disconnected. Doug we will shoot you if you do not surrender. I'm in a car. Outside the house I can see you. What the fuck is going on? You didn't hurt that little girl did you? You know where Sophie is don't you? I called everybody and. This isn't going to end well. Doug, let the girl go. Doug listen they will kill you. Please. Say something. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, I fucked up. I fucked up so bad. I'm sorry. It's peaceful. I suppose, those wings when I look at it. Yes, that's what makes it art, that's the beauty of it. What do you feel when you look at it? Just freedom. It's amazing. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for all the trouble that I caused you today. Doug, just turn yourself in. I'll tell them that your aren't a bad guy. I'll tell them how you saved me from those people. Just stop okay, just stop. Doug this is your last warning. Let the girl go and get out of the car. I've been trying to sell this painting and I've never been able to. Now I'm not at all spiritual or superstitious, but I believe that I painted this for a reason. That it was meant to be here, it was meant to be here right now. I want you to have it. Doug. Just take it. When you get out of the car, you run back to the police, and you don't look back. Why? You're free okay, just go. What are you gonna... I said just go, please! Go! She safe? She's safe, now step out slowly. Put your gun down Doug, put your hands in the air! It's been an incredible run for the Rockies of late and a lot of that is contributed to the way Francisco Joseph has been playing. Last night he was three for four at the plate, one home run and two RBI's. You know ever since the horrifying event a few weeks ago, with the kidnapping of his daughter Kennedy, he has been playing like a man possessed. What a remarkable story. The police were able to rescue his daughter, after a violent shootout with the perpetrator. She's now safely secure and her father is on a phenomenal run.
