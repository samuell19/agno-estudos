I've got this. I've got this. Yeah. I know. Well, don't just stand there and watch. Go fucking do something. Oh, please. Off. On my mind. Why do I keep wasting my time? Man, you make it easy for me. So why can't I make you love me, love me. Oh god, It's the snapping. Come on. No. You know you love it. Why can't I make you love me? Are we too early? Michael! What? We're not going to a party. Hey! Hi! OK. Let's go. Are we too early? Oh, no. Of course not. There's no such thing as too early. - You're perfect. - We just flew here. Michael. Roads were wide open. Good to see you, Paul. Hi, honey. Hi, Jon. Hey, Grandpa. Thank you. Hi, Dad. Hey. Hello, how you doing? Good, you? How are you doing? Good. OK, good. Yeah. Uh, Michael, you... - you want to get the... - Yeah, no. I'll get it. I'll get it. - I got you a little something. - Aw. - Really, it's nothing. - Sweetie... It's nothing. It's just... it's just a little something, you know. We didn't really know... Well, I can't wait to see what the stores recommend for an event like this. All right. Let's see. What is this? Come on, let me help with... - let me just... - No, I don't... Jonathan, you wanna hand me the scissors? I said I have it. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine, guys. There we go. Oh. Salt and pepper shakers. Look at that. How sweet is this? Look, it's you and me, and we're dancing. We had this whole back and forth about... Look at that. That's so cute. Now you can think of me whenever you put salt on your wounds. Or pepper. Or... or pepper. Or both. Thank you, Jen. Oh. That was very thoughtful. Someone's here. OK. Yeah. That's... all right. So your beds are all made up and ready. Perfect. It's Liz. Jonathan. Oh, great. Look what Jennifer made. Jennifer, you made this cake? Look at this. It's the size of a human head. This could feed a village, yes. Oh, thanks, darling. OK. OK. Why is she here? Oh, I know. I told Dad it should just be family. Salt and pepper shakers. What was I thinking? I think she liked them. She pretended to. She never pretends well enough. What does that mean? She lies just badly enough so you know she's lying. Oh, come on. I really think she liked them. I do. Besides, it's like she said. It's not like there's a perfect gift for this kind of thing. They're probably from Kenya or Peru or somewhere. Can you imagine the carbon footprint? Carbon footprint and all, I thank you. Hi. Hi, Liz. Hi. Hey, Jen. You look great. Wow, your hair looks great Thanks. Hi, Michael. It really does. Hi, Liz. Jonathan. Look at you. He's a great student. Straight A's. One B. Mom. Thanks for coming, Liz. Sure. I know it really means a lot to Mom that we all do this. Yeah, it does. It's a privilege. Anything we can do? Here's an interesting article. The local Annual Thanksgiving Deep-Fried Turkey Festival apparently is going vegan. Unbelievable. They're pretty. Mhm. Mm. Your mother always had a thing for white tulips. Always the white ones, even in college. Mhm. What's she doing? She'll be right down. Oh, what if she needs help? She's fine. She's fine, Jennifer. Whatever she's doing, she'd rather do it herself. Good. Is everybody OK? Good. Everybody is fine. We're all fine. We're doing great. Jonathan? Uh-huh. Jonathan has a hard time talking about it. No, I don't. When's it happening? Soon, kiddo. Oh, hello. The flowers look beautiful. So no one's drinking coffee? Oh, let me... I... I can get that. That's... I'd love some. Yeah? Please, here. There you go. Mom? Do you want some? No, I'm good. Dad? No, I'm fine. Liz? Mm, please. Cream? Yeah. There you go. Thanks. There you go. There you go. Should someone call her? I'm sure she's on her way. She made that? Wow. Are you sure that's a good idea? Hey! Oh, Chris. Hey. Didn't know you were... good to see you. Chris, I'm so happy that you came. Oh. Are you kidding? Of course I did. Now I have someone to get drunk with. I love where this is heading. Jesus, look at you. Hi, sweetie. Hey, Mom. Oh. You're not a pimply kid anymore. Hey, I'm a pimply teenager now. Hey. Hey. - I'm Chris. - Oh... Oh, OK. I'll take that. Good to meet you. Yeah. You're... you're hot. Must be breaking some hearts, right? Hey, sweetie, how are you? Good, how are you? Chris good to see you. No, no, no. Hi. Oh, you know what? We only made up one single bed. Nice to meet you. Oh, that's... that's OK, Mom. I can... I can help them. I can make my own bed. No, no, no, no. Let me... let me help. Yeah. We can catch up at the same time. OK. Come on, let's get some coffee. Great. OK. Elisabeth's here. Oh, fabulous. Right and then right? Down here. It's been a while. Yeah. We thought you might come to Jonathan's school play. Sorry. I wanted to. I really wanted to be there, but there was... I can't remember. Something. Mhm. Here. Then Dad's birthday. Oh, I wanted to be there for that too. Uh-huh. Hey, thanks for all your texts. What? Reminding me. Oh, yeah. Sure. Everybody thought you forgot, so... Yeah, I realize that. Well, it's happened. It has. It wasn't intended as criticism. Towels in here, I think. So How's the dance program going? I dropped out. Oh. Oh. I... I thought you made this big discovery and... and finally found your thing. I did make a big discovery. I found it wasn't my thing. Along with the weird acupuncture thing and the quilting thing - and the yoga therapy thing. - Very informed. Very sympathetic. None of them are your thing, all these things that they pay for. OK. Here we go. And while we're sharing, what the hell is she doing here? Uh, what's Mr. Dull doing here? Mr. Dull happens to be my husband. Yeah, well, Chris happens to be my husband. You said you'd split up. We got back together. Are you even sure you're gay? We've been together for nearly a year and a half. God, a year and a half. Oh, come on. Of what? Disappointment, crisis, drama. Because what was it? She was... you said she was an immature, irresponsible, shit-for-brains. Maybe I should wait downstairs. Yeah, maybe you should, thanks. I'm sorry. Shit. Chris is helping me get through this. Ever thought about that? You promised not to bring her. No. You told me not to bring her. There's a difference. OK. OK. Please, just give Mom this one weekend without having the whole world revolve around you, Anna. It's just one weekend. Will you do that? Hmm? Can you do that? Can you quit being a fucking bitch? OK. Fuck. He's lost like 35 pounds. Really? It was mostly cutting out sugar... Uh-huh. And then cheese, which was the hard part. Cheese? How do you think she's doing? Dodging every emotional bullet. Yeah. And how are you? I'm a little tired of people saying "and how are you." Yeah, sorry. How's work? Work is... an undergrad, last week, refused to read "The Odyssey" because it was literally everything that was wrong with the world. "The Odyssey"? Mhm. "The Odyssey." OK. Three down. H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O. Five letters. What? Let me see it. That's it. H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O. Huh. Yes, I'm surrendering to Chablis. Shall I get a funnel? Thanks. H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, five letters. That is... That's the whole clue? - What are they doing? - That's it. It's weird. Playing soccer? It's hard to tell. That's it. H, I, J, K... So are you and Chris living together now, or what? No, it's... we've been a little on and off. When I was your age, I had someone I moved in with four times. And out four times. With all my belongings, all my books, and my cat. That crazy cat. That crazy cat. That's a lot of moving. For a cat. Right. Well, I was confused. I was out there fighting for free love, so how could I tie myself down like that? It gets easier, I guess. Oh yes, the old woman lied. Water. What? Water? H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O. H to O, five letters. Water is the answer. H20. Well, that's... that is brilliant. Oh. - Pretty good. - That's good. He's good, your dad. He is good. The best. Did you know that next to Q, X, and Z, J is the least used letter in the English language? Hi. Honey, have some cake. Your mom's cake's over there. It's so delicious. Yeah, this cake is so good. You have to try it. Sweet. I want some of that. It's so dense. She doesn't use any flour. Jonathan, your shoes are wet. You should put them by the door. I know this is the... Well, you know it's time when you have to start drinking your Chablis from a paper cup. Are you OK? Mom? - I'm fine. - I'll get it. I'll get it. Good. Be... It's all right. I'm... it's fine. Just... just tell me if you're... I'm not. There's glass everywhere. OK. Be careful, Jennifer. You never liked those glasses. I hated those glasses. OK. So 11 across, roadside dweller... There you go. ET. A frog! A fish. "Finding Nemo"? "Shark Tale." You kicked ass. Oh, OK, uh... uh... It's a hat. Harry Potter. I think she got it. No, no, you go. You go. Right. Um, you're a black panther. King, a king. Oh, oh, "Lion King"! Yaah... Come on, go. I want to see what you got. I think you're a deodorant commercial. "King Kong"! Yeah! Great. Well done. I'm OK now. Blow out the candles. Hi. Do you remember that night at Pete's party on the farm, when we tried acid? Yes. I think you persuaded me we needed to listen to the fireflies because... because they were trying to tell us something. Probably not to do any more acid and just stick to mushrooms. Will you look after my girls? You don't need to ask. They're OK, aren't they? They're OK. Hey. Thank you, Lily. Thank you, Liz. You're up early. Couldn't sleep. Yeah. How are you going to do it? Didn't they tell you? They told me not to worry about it and make sure Grandma has a nice weekend. Well, they're... they were just trying to protect you. But I want to know. You sure? Tomorrow, after you've all gone, I'll put her to bed. I'll give her some medicine in a glass. And then she'll go to sleep while I sit beside her. And then that's it. Yeah. It's illegal, right? Yeah. It's... it's illegal here, but it's legal in some states, in Washington, Oregon. We could've gone to Europe, but this is... this is our home. This is the house that... that she built. This is where Lil wants it to happen. She seems OK to me. She doesn't seem that bad. Do you know how ill she is? You've seen how she walks, how she can... can only use her right arm, right? In a few weeks, it's possible she won't be able to move at all, to talk, or even to swallow. Try to imagine the horror of not being able to swallow. She'd be surrounded by machines to help her breathe, to remove the saliva and so on. And we'd have to feed her through a tube in her side, there. She doesn't want that. And she's decided that... that now's the... now's the time to do it while she's still in charge of... of what happens to her. Will you go to jail? After she's gone, I'll go out for a walk. I get back. I call 9-1-1. I... I tell them what's happened, that she must have taken the medicine while I was out. And... and something like yes, I'm sure she's dead. I'm a doctor and everything. Yeah. I'll tell them... I'll tell them I went out for a walk. And that's why we have to do it now, while she still has the use of her arm. Huh. They're waking up. Morning. Morning. Mm, cholesterol. Sleep all right? - God, it smells so good. - Good morning, everybody. Good morning. How did everybody sleep? Smells amazing. Wow. Whoa, Jonathan. I haven't seen you up this early in forever. It's really not that early, Dad. Are Anna and Chris up? - It's 8:30. - No. Jonathan, why don't you run up and wake them? No, I'll do it. Oh, Mom. I can do it. I can do it. Anna! Chris! You up yet? I'm dead soon. You coming down? That should do it. Pancakes. Yeah, that should do it. Did you know this... Want some help with that? ...one of the oldest foods in history? I did... I... I did know that, Michael. They unearthed a tomb in Sumeria... Anybody want tea? Anybody want tea? You want tea? Liz? Tea? Yeah, tea. Great. Of course. Where is this from? It's... it's Beluga, it's the... the same as we had in St. Petersberg. Jonno, will you pass the salt and pepper, please. A little bit more expensive, not on the black market. Salt and pepper, please. I can't wait. Is that enough? That's plenty. Thanks so much. One, please. As you wish. You know, the Indian independence movement started when Gandhi asked the Indians to make their own salt in an act of defiance against the British Empire. Hmm. Just think about it, how something so insignificant could lead to something so powerful. You were always such a rebel. Did you hear that? I'm a rebel. You hear her, Jonno? I think she was kidding. Dad, she's choking. No I'm fine. Dad, she's choking. I'm fine. Fine. Wow we really lucked out with the weather today. Could you pass the marmalade, please? Yeah, we did, didn't we? Maybe we should go for a walk later. - A walk? - Oh, yeah. That's a really nice idea. What do you want to do, Mom? I'm up for that. Mom, what do you want to do? I think a walk sounds like a nice idea. Then tonight, just to keep you on your toes, if it's all right with everyone, I'd like to celebrate Christmas. It'll be so much better than boring old Thanksgiving, right? And I think, Darling, maybe you could make us a big Christmas dinner. The whole shebang? The whole shebang. And Jonno, maybe you could go with your dad and find us a tree. Great. OK. The axe is in the... in the barn. The... the axe. Mhm. Don't get arrested. And then afterwards, Jonno, why don't you help me decorate the tree? Mm, sure. Wait, are we going to get presents? Oh, I like that line of thinking. If you are a very nice, Santa will bring you an inheritance, yes. Cool. Are you rich? Jonathan! Why not? Fine. The only stipulation being it has to all be spent on hookers and blow. Sounds good. She means it. Is this really what you want? I mean, you could... you could wait for an actual Christmas. Jennifer, don't fucking ruin this. OK. Well, I could, um, I could be Santa, if you want. Yeah, that's a great idea. Enough food, I could get that belly. Dude, that would be so sick. Oh, yeah. And now pass the bacon. Ooh. No more lean shit for me. I'm gonna have this bacon. Hop replacement surgery, they used to ask for the hips back upon the patient's death. They would have to sign a release. And they would go back to the morgue... Hey listen... Yeah. Is it... is it your idea that you wanna have... I like her. So do I. Plus it's so, so chic to have a lesbian in the family. Didn't you know that? We tried it once, remember? Was it '73 or '74? Yeah, it was definitely a drunken attempt. Maybe a lack of technique? Oh, I thought your technique was fine. She's... she's fragile, isn't she? Anna? Anna. No, she's fine. She's absolutely fine. She's just a little flighty. All this back and forth, is that a sign the relationship's right, or that it's broken? Maybe they don't really love each other, or maybe they really love each other. Yeah, useful analysis. Thanks. Oh, I'm out of gas. What? I'm out of gas. Are you OK? Yeah, I just... I need a... just maybe... Wait, wait, wait. ...sit down. Hey, hey, Paul! Jen, can you come? Oh. Beautiful. Invigorating, isn't it? Yes, it is. It is. It is invigorating. What? Jonathan, cover your ears. Why? Just... This is... this is where you were conceived. Oh my god. That is gross. Here? Yeah. Right here? Well, yeah. We were, um, visiting with a... um, a colleague of Paul's who lived right near here. And, well, the wife is just fucking annoying. Oh, god. She would never stop talking. Yak, yak, yak. Never stopped, even when she was eating or swimming in the ocean, she just never stopped. And all that came out of her mouth... Was shit. It was the worst. And so I pretended to be sick and ran outside. And we came here, and then he cured me. - I cured you. - Yeah. OK. TMI. TMI. And then we just got so fond of this area that we bought some land when it became available. And then... well, we couldn't even afford it at that time. We couldn't afford you then. No. Well, I'm not surprised you come from someplace so beautiful. Aw. Oh, honey. Sweet. Well, that's deep. That is... that is deep. What about me? What about you, sweetie? Where was I conceived? Oh. Do you know, I don't... - I don't... I don't really know. - I do. I know. I know. It was when I went with you to that convention in Buffalo. We stayed at that horrible motel near the airport, and I got bedbugs. Oh. - I remember that. - Oh, yeah. - Oh. - Aw. But it was totally worth it. It was totally worth it. Completely. That's pretty funny. All right. Shall we move on? Sure. I'm OK, yeah. Liz, you're a genius! All right, Liz! Oh, is that so? Well, you did two. Oh, that was so lame. That was not good. I've thought of a better... Are you all left-handed? Oh no, no, no. Just Jonno. Just the cool guy. Just Mr. Cool. One more time. Oh, courageous. Watch this! Left-handed! Anna? Anna? Anna. Come on. I know. What did you think I was doing? Playing Candy Crush? Taking a nap? Getting high? Anna, OK. OK, yeah. Yes, I did. I did. And I'm sorry. Can you blame me? Yes, I fucking can blame you. You never give me a fucking break. Look, you arrived late, as always, looking like shit. God, no one even knows where you are half the time. You disappear for a month eating mushrooms in the desert, or whatever the hell off the grid means, just as Mom gets sick, and you expect me not to be judgmental? I'm sorry you feel that way. I just wish that with so little time left, you made more of an effort for the family. That's all. I am going to do that. You OK? Yeah. You sure? I've made up my mind. Tomorrow, when they're about to do it, I'm going to call 9-1-1 and report a suicide attempt. OK. Um, shit. OK, that's... are you sure? Because she says she's ready. I'm not ready. She's ready, but I'm not! I don't know. It's too fucked up. I thought you were against this too. What about the effing vegans? You want me to take care of that? Oh yeah. Well, maybe some sweet potato or something. I don't know. Potato. That it? Yeah, that's it. What? The magic potion. I mean, where is it from? Google. How you know it's going to work? Trust me, darlings, there's enough pentobarbital in that little package to kill off half of Manhattan. As you can imagine, everything's been organized within an inch of its life. Yep. I can imagine. It is a little insane. No, no, no, it's not. It's... the people in this situation, those that choose to end their lives prematurely, are characteristically not insane, not even... not even depressed. They're usually intelligent, articulate, analytical, and deeply, deeply controlling. Thanks. Sweet potatoes. On it. OK. This is nice, doing Christmas. Yeah, I guess. I like this, spending time together, man and boy in the wild. we should do more of this. Sure. Hey, here's your fun fact about trees. Do you know there's more non-deciduous trees in Norway than the entire continent of Africa? That's fascinating, Dad. Isn't it? 'Cause... here we go. A lot of good choices over here. Yeah. Fantastic. Oh, how about this one? That one? Yeah. It's kind of small. How about this one? OK. Good. Good option. Here we go. Whoa. Fuck. You OK? Sh... yeah, I... You sure? No, I'm good. I'm good. Yeah. I'm just, uh, used to a different kind of axe. Think that's enough? We need something else in this. How about rosemary for these? - Do you think maybe... - Rosemary's great. Does that really go with beef? Oh, definitely. Uh, honey, what can I do for you? I'm really... I'm fine. I'm fine. It'll wear off. Honey, come on, seriously. What about some... you should sit down. Maybe some ice? Maybe some frozen peas? Oh, yeah. OK. - That's... - Thanks for being so helpful. That's OK. OK. Are you really suffering? Oh, no. I'm... I'm... really, it's fine. I offered to help. I mean, it's not funny, but it's pretty funny. Don't laugh at your father. It is kind of funny. I don't even really need these. Jonathan? Yeah? - Do you wanna help? - I could cut these up. Sure. What about... how about a glass of wine? So why don't you start hanging. And if you put anything where I don't like it, I will yell at you. OK. So are you going to give me some super important life advice now? Nah. Old people are supposed to be insightful and, you know, pass on your experiences so I remember them at crucial moments in my life. Oh, well, we old people are just pretending to be insightful to give you the impression that life adds up to something meaningful and comprehensible. It works. Hmm. Actually, I think the... the trick is you just show up, and you get life your best shot. Although handwritten thank-you notes and being on time don't hurt. Got it. Hmm. Your mom made this one. Cool. So is there anything that I should know about you that the rest of the family is going to find out in the future? I don't know. Do you wanna have kids? Yeah, I think so. Are you gay? No. Trans? No. Anything else I don't know about yet? No, sorry. What do you think you want to be? I want to be an actor. Wow. Well, do they know about that? Um, nobody knows about that, except now you do. Well, I will take your secret to my grave. You're doing great. Wow, smells amazing. That is a tremendous tie, Michael. Thank you. It is a tremendous tie. Hmm? Where is she? Oh, she'll be here. Jen? Thank you. Hmm. Short measures. Michael? Thank you. Hmm. Mm. I think I might go check. Hi. So when do we eat? You look amazing. Fantastic. Wow. Mom, you look... Thank you. ...so beautiful. Thanks very much. Everybody ready? Emmenthaler... Hang on, wait. It's um... No, it's on the front, yeah. - Let's try that again. - OK, ready? Everyone say cheese. All right. Here we go. I think so, yeah. Emmenthaler! Emmenthaler! Good, good. - What's Emmenthaler? - It's cheese. - Paul, did you get the tie? - Oh, Dad? Could we get one with you in it? Maybe Liz, would you mind if we... Of course. OK. Good idea, Jennifer. Oh, yeah. Just a family photo. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. That was a good one. Yes. You got it? Right, sit. Let's, um, let's try this wine. I'm going to make the toast. Oh, there's a surprise. To wonderful life. To wonderful life. Mm. Mm. Wow. So this is, uh, Gevrey Chambertin. It's a red burgundy. It's a French pinot noir. Mm, mm, mm. I can taste sunshine. Good sunshine, eh? Oh, yes. Jonathan, um, you want to try? This is amazing. Yeah. Oh, no, no. He... he... he won't. I've had wine before. When? Mm. Well, it's illegal, so. Yeah. You're not getting any. So is killing Grandma. Ooh, nice comeback, kiddo. Oh shit. Whoa. Very smart. You're going to make an excellent lawyer someday. Actually, I'm going to be an actor. An actor? Yeah. And isn't that a damn fine thing? It is. Well, there's plenty of time to think about it, so. I don't need to think about it. I know it. Actually, yeah. I... I think... I think Jonathan may have written a little something for his grandma. - What? - Yeah. Really? Dude, why would you... Jonno, that's great. - Oh Jonathan, I'm honored. - No, please. - You wrote something? - That's great. - Can we hear it? - Jonno. It's like a rap. It's kind of rough. I don't want to do it right now. What are you waiting for let me hear it. Well, come on. Let's... Go for it, dude. OK. Whatever. Yeah, OK. Here goes nothing. Hit me. Family, family, more than a man, it's a clan. Sometimes you gotta make a stand, make a plan, raise a hand, seize the day, find a way. Embrace the solution, make a resolution. It's collusion and confusion. And everyone thinks they know the right way, but things are frightening. Thoughts like lightning, emotions heightening. Sorrow for tomorrow, and tomorrow time is borrowed. Feeling hollow, but better die alive, to strive, say goodbye, feeling whole in your soul. That's the goal. So let it roll. Woo! That was... Yeah! ...wonderful! Way to go, Jonno. Jonno! High five! Go Jonno! Woo! Really wonderful. Who wants meat? Anybody need horseradish? I'm the meat guy. Meat anyone? Any meat? No one wants meat? Liz, I'll take some. 20 bites, 20 bites, and then you'll... Oh... Oh, I wanted that one. Potatoes. That's all I wanted. You've taken the crispy one. You need a new joke, Dad. With the power of my mind. Whoa! Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Please don't laugh. Please do not encourage him. Jonathan! This is really great. How does he... no one's watching the spoon. Oh no. Thank you. Very good. Jonathan, this one's for you. Cool. Thanks. Hmm. What is it? A book. Yeah. Thanks. Well done, Jonno. What... what's uh... It's Rilki. Rilke. Yeah. Yeah. Ooh. - What? - Whoa. What is it? $100 bill. I've never had one of these. How are you supposed to spend it? Hookers and blow, of course. Yes. Do you remember these? Yeah. Of course I do. Thank you. Well, tell them. Look, it's so beautiful. She bought this when we were... where were we? We went to that little antique shop. Yeah, in... in Venice. Really. That was a great trip. One of the best trips ever. She saw this in some antique jeweler's. "Imagine who wore this." And he thought you were going to be a contessa. Well, close. Thank you. Love you, Liz. Oh, wow. Oh. Do you remember? Yeah, I remember this. It's Grandma's ring. It's the only thing I liked about her. That is actually true. And I don't blame you, sweetheart. She was a nightmare. Mm. Michael. I get a present? This is... oh. Mhm. I had to look all over for this. Oh my god! That is so good. That is so great! He's never gonna take that off. Oh, that is... Oh! yeah! He's never going to take that off. Nor should he. What do you think? What do you think? Oh my god, that is so you. Jonathan, I'm going to your parent-teacher conference wearing this. That is so you. This was the first kind of serious piece of jewelry that I bought for myself, at your age. That's just... this is beautiful. Oh, look at that. That really suits you. Thank you. That's... you're welcome, sweetheart. I love it. I don't know if you already have one of these, but you can always use another one. Oh... Oh my god. What is it? No, please, no. Mom... Yeah. You need it. Put it back in the box. Oh, it's a smooth brand. Oh, it's your favorite color. Oh my god. Oh my lord. It matches. Oh my god. It matches. Lily, I'm afraid she already has one. That's not your only present. I want you to have this. I've never taken it off since your dad gave it to me, 22 years ago. Oh. Oh, god. Thank you. OK. Thank you. You're welcome. I think maybe I haven't taken this off in even longer. But maybe now it's time to give it to you. You belong to somebody new, but tonight, you belong to me. What's next? Wait down... No. Although. Although, although we're apart, you're part of my heart. But tonight, you belong to me. Just to little ol' me. Way down... Way down upon the stream. Stream. What fun it is to laugh and sing a sleighing song tonight. Hey, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh, hey! Thank you, husband. Yeah. Thanks, Grandpa. Thanks. Thanks. I could die happy right now. So could I. Hm. Mm. I love these plates. Well, you can have them. They're yours. I'll just do eat out of the pot, then. Yeah, with your salt and pepper shaker by your side. Oh yeah. Yeah, I'd like that. I mean, if that's OK with... I mean, maybe you could pick something too. How about my vinyl? You used to love all those R&B records and Nina Simone. Yeah. You know, maybe we could wait until you're actually dead? I think it's time for a joint. What? Really? Oh, what are you looking... come on, I was at Woodstock. What's the big deal? You weren't. All right. Well, I was nearby. I was there in my mind. Bullshit. Nowadays, you never meet anyone our age who wasn't at Woodstock. True. Allegedly. Allegedly, I have some. Oh, what kind? Just Napa Valley grass. Not strong enough. Sweetheart, will you get mine? What? Wait. Mom? Oh. Jonathan, you should never smoke weed unless you're dying. OK. Or having sex. - I already tried it. - What? Did you hear that? Excuse me? What? I don't want you to end up like some unfocused pothead who just drifts through life staring at the clouds. Hey, I'm right here. Yeah. Well, you're not exactly the perfect role model. And you are? Just in time. Oh, come on, Dad. Oh my god. Oh my god. Thank you. Great. Great. Let's all get stoned. Jesus, what is this stuff? You like? Are you kidding me? Yes. That is some next level shit. Ooh. Mm. Are you sure? Mhm. OK. It's been a long time. Gotta hold the smoke. Count to 10. Hey, I too was at Woodstock, metaphorically. OK. Maybe I wasn't. OK. Come on. Oh. Go Jen. No way. We're here to do something together, right? Yes. Wow. Hold it. Oh my god. Hold it. When will I feel it? In a little... just a little bit. Whoa. Yeah. Just... just chill. You OK, Mom? Just chill. You good? I don't know. I'm... Oh no. Oh my god. We are terrible parents. Wait, stop. Does it have tobacco in it? It's just Michael quit smoking. No, it's all right. It's fine. I'm sure it's fine. OK. You know, I'm really not that bossy. I'm... I'm actually very sweet. Yes, you are. Come on, pass it on, Dad. Yeah, I'm sorry. The other way. You know, I know... I know you guys already talked about it, but I wasn't there. And uh, anyway, I just wanted to say that I understand. Well, thank you, Chris. It's just weird. You're here now, but tomorrow, you'll be dead. And we know. But I'm here now. I'm really here now. And you know, once we set a date, actually, it's funny, but it... it... I stopped worrying about dying, and I could focus more on living. Aren't you afraid? Are you? Well, I'm not dying tomorrow. Well, at some point. Yes. I mean, we all know that it's... it's going to happen. I just didn't know that I would know that I would know when it was actually happening. No, but isn't that the point? I mean, we sort of... we forget in order to just get on with living. But the living is so much better if you don't forget, because then you don't get caught up in the bullshit. And then you can take a risk, and you can bend some rules. You know? The days go by too slowly, and the years go by too fast. Bingo. That's so cool. Wow. It's Magnetic Fields. What's that? It's music, Dad. Oh. Look, I am... I am here now, and I'm full of good food and incredible wine. And I'm satisfied and happy. I have my... my guy, my grandson, the actor/rapper, my oldest friend, and the two kids that I am so proud of. And the ones that they love. The two kids I'm so proud of? Yes. Why would you be proud of us? Why wouldn't I be proud of you? I mean, you barely know us. What? What's that supposed to mean? Oh, sweetie, I raised you to be strong and independent, and you are. Really? Really. No we're not. Anna... Look, I'm sorry to break it to you, but you have two daughters who are, in their own way, seriously fucked up. What are you talking about? I don't think that that is necessarily the case... Look, I might be crazy, but I'm not stupid. What are you talking about? OK. Remember when Chris and I went away for a month? Yeah. Well, I wasn't living in the desert. Where... we were you? I was in a psychiatric hospital, because I tried to kill myself. Jesus Christ. I can't fucking believe you. Oh my god. Oh, please. Did she threaten to cut her wrist with a plastic knife - so she could get some attention? - Shut the fuck up, Jennifer. Because that's is what she does. Always. You didn't raise us to be strong. And everybody gets sucked in. You just raised us not to bother you with weakness. Oh my god, stop. You're like Martha fucking Stewart, Mom. Anna. What a great mom you wanted everybody to think you were. Anna. Be creative was your mantra. Be whatever you want to be. Just don't disturb the grownups while you're doing it, and be sure to clean up afterwards. OK, stop. Dad. OK. Stupid little fucking... Jen... Jennifer, don't. Don't, don't. Stop, stop. - Dad! - Stop. Dad. I want to go to bed. I think I have to go to bed now. Sweetheart, it's all right. I didn't... It's all right. Let's clear... clear the table. She wants to be alone for a little bit. What? She didn't overstate it. She's lucky that she survived. Of course that's how she describes it, because she wants maximum sympathy. All right. What do you say you and I go have a talk? Come on. Why wouldn't she tell us? Well, she said you'd say it was about attention getting. That you'd say it was about maximum sympathy. And I don't know. Maybe you're right. But then I gotta ask, what made her need that kind of attention? We'd been on and off for a while. I wasn't sure, she wasn't sure, the usual shit. But when the ambulance came, I couldn't even bring myself to get in with her, hold her hand, whatever, just be with her. All I wanted to do was run, and so that's what I did. Is she OK now? Is she OK? No. Well, she's bipolar. What does that even mean? It means a shitload of meds, forever. So why aren't you running now? I don't know. I like her. I like her family. Look, I... What? Your mom seems so sure. And... and... and I really... I really do believe that it's her decision. What are you trying to say? Anna's not exactly well, and... and so I don't want Anna's perspective to ruin... Say it. Anna's going to call 9-1-1 when your mom is taking the pills. Wait! Wait! What the hell are you thinking? You let her do what she wants to do. You got that? You let her do what she wants. You cannot make that call. Do you understand me? I'm not... Tell me you understand. I'm not ready. I don't care. What if... what if Dad is wrong? Maybe it'll be another six months before it gets real bad, maybe a year. He's a fucking doctor. He knows what he's doing. It doesn't matter. Doctors are wrong all the time. Mom knows what she wants, and he knows how to do it. OK? That's enough. I want to know her. I want her to know me! Don't you get that? I need more time. So do I. But this is Mom's decision. It's her life. It's her death. I'm sorry you're sick. I'm not sick! Yes, you are. OK. What are you doing? Don't go through my shit. Xanax, Serax... Don't touch my shit! Lithium. You know who they give this stuff to? They give it to sick people. I'm not sick. They just keep things in check. I'm OK when I take them. But your brain chemistry is fucked, and you can't trust your emotions, so shut the fuck up from now on and you just let her do what she wants to do. Look at me. Look at me. I am sorry that I've not been there for you. I will be better, I... I... I promise. I will be better. But this is Mom's decision, and that is how it's going to be. OK? She understands. Chris, thanks. Yeah. Hey. Ah, what are you doing? Looking at photos. Uh-huh. Uh... Here we are. Mexico. Me, Dad, Mom, and Liz. San Francisco. And me, Dad, Mom, and Liz. Hiking in Banff. And um, London. Me, Anna, Dad, Mom, and Liz. Her best friend. Yeah. Right. And his lover. No. Something. No. No. I mean... Mom told me years ago that Dad and Liz had dated, you know, in college, before Mom even knew him. I never thought, just never put two and two together. And then last night... Yeah? What? I saw them kissing. But like, but like, for real. No, they were probably just... What? Just... they were... they were probably just comforting each other. I don't know. I don't know. No. What if... what if he's in love with her? What if he always was? I... I don't think that that's something that... I mean, wouldn't that cloud his judgment? OK, you're really tired, honey. I'm not fucking tired, Michael. You... What do you think I should do? I think you should sleep. But should I tell Mom? Should I... should I tell... No... Should I tell them both that I will not support this after all? No, your mom has made her decision. But what do you think? Well, Lily's been very clear from the very beginning that what she... What do you think! What do you... what do you think about... about all of it? You. Right here, right now, what did you think? I think this is a really difficult decision, and that the family... Do you think anything? Do you... do you feel? Yeah, I feel things! Of course I do! What? It's impossible to get any kind of reaction from you. If... if I... if I threw this wine in your face, you'd just tell me what district the grapes were from. Oh, that is not true. I think I'm... God. Ugh! I... I'm so sorry. I... oh my god. Honey. Honey. Honey, here. You wanna... Will you close the blinds? You want to sleep some more? I want to wake up again, one more time. And I just woke up one morning, and I couldn't remember what healthy felt like. It didn't scare me. It was a relief. So I canceled my plans with Chris that night. I took a shower. Isn't that weird? I watched the happy people on TV, and I ate a handful of pills and drunk a mug of vodka, passed out. Then Chris came over anyway. She wanted to surprise me. She called 9-1-1. The ambulance took me to the hospital and pumped me out. I stayed three weeks. They gave me medicine, and I still take it, and I'll keep taking it. And that's OK. Why didn't you tell me? You always told us to be strong. Oh, Jesus. Be free. I didn't want to be free. I just wanted to feel like me. I am so sorry. I am so, so sorry. So sorry, baby. And you had just found out you were sick. I didn't want you to worry about it. Oh my god. You have no idea how happy it would have made me to worry about it. Let me worry about you. Oh. I'm so sorry. I love you. I love you, sweet girl. I'm sorry. Ha-ha! Do you... can I... I got it. Do you want me to... No, sweetie, I'm fine. I got it. Mom? OK? Good morning. - Hey. - Hi. - Morning. - Hey. Morning. Hi. Morning. OK. Oh. OK. OK. So today. Today. Um, can we all try to just behave as normally as possible? Just read the Sunday paper and nap, play the stock market, write a play. make a match stick model of the... of the Empire State Building. Just a normal Sunday. I need to have a normal, lazy Sunday. I need that from you. OK? - Yeah. - OK. - Got it. - OK. - You got it. - All right. Great. OK. Good. Um, no juice? Jennifer? Uh, no. I'm not thirsty. Shall I make some coffee? No. Jonathan, why don't you pass the juice? Sure. - Anna? - Thank you. Hmm? What? Um, would you come with me for a minute? OK. Remember when you were about eight years old, it was summer. And you... you came rushing into the house, and... and you said that you had seen Dad and Elisabeth kissing in the woods. And everybody just laughed at you. Do you remember? Yeah, I remember. And people said you were crazy. And... and... and... and people said you were bad. Yes. You said I was bad. Well, I think you were... I... I think Dad and Liz are lovers. What? Last night, I saw them together. Think about it. Every family vacation, she's been there. Every important occasion, it's always been Mom, Dad, and Liz. Why? I mean, that's not normal. We've grown up thinking that's normal. That is not normal. Well, do we tell Mom? No. No. We can't. We can't. Can we? Well fuck, I don't know anything anymore. Look, if he's with Liz, he can't make a rational decision. What if she's manipulating him? We've known Liz all our lives. I don't believe that's her. I'm not saying she's doing it deliberately, but... but... OK. We tell Mom we've changed our minds, and we're not going along with this anymore. Yes? Jonathan, go upstairs, please. Why? Jennifer... Don't ask questions. Just go upstairs Jonathan? I want you to go upstairs now. Too bad. - I don't want you to hear this. - Hear what? - I'm part of this, Mom. - He's right. He should be here. What's going on? Can we just see... see this through with a bit of ordinary grace? Ordinary grace, you fucking hypocrite? - All right, sit down, Jennifer. - Whoa. OK. No. Please don't... don't tell me to sit down, OK? I won't. I won't sit down. I won't. This... this is sick. Jennifer, whatever it is you want to say, do us all a favor and don't say it. Everything's being said. - Oh, not quite everything. - Don't do this, Jennifer. Jonathan, stop. What the hell is going on here? Maybe you shouldn't go through with it. Maybe you don't have all the information you need to make an informed decision. What are you talking about? Dad? What? Dad. What? Tell her. OK. OK. We're not going to let this happen. It's not right. N... Jennifer, we have gone over and over this for months, and we came to the conclu... as a family, we agreed that if this is what I want... But I don't think you know what you want. How dare you? We got... we got behind this on the basis of a lot of assumptions. Assumptions? What... what... what assumptions? OK. Hey, hey, let her talk, Paul, please. Please, we're... we're talking with Mom right now, OK? Dad, not you. Well, who's we? We? Anna and I agree. Right? Anna? Anna. Yeah, Jennifer and I agree. I cannot... no. I cannot back down from this. No. I... this... no. Well... well... well, we... we can. Jennifer, this is not what she needs right now. You can shut up. Oh Liz. This is not your decision. It's not yours either. This is your mother's choice! Is it really? Or has she been helped along? Huh? What are you saying? Look, I choose. I choose. Look at me. I choose not to be locked in a body that cannot walk or talk or eat or drink or even breathe on its own. I am choosing not to be fed vanilla-fucking-flavored protein drinks through a tube in my side. I choose. I choose. I am choosing. There are moral issues, OK? Ethical issues. Do not make my last act on this earth in defiance of you. Please don't do that to us. Jennifer, what's going on here? I saw you last night. You saw what? Saw... what did you see? What did she see? You two. What are you talk... saw what? - What are you talking about? - Jennifer. No. No. You don't get to speak. No, no. I really think it's my turn to speak. You say I'm having some love affair with your father, right? Well, you are, aren't you? Aren't you? Christ. Jennifer, you know what? You were always such a fucking prig. Look how lucky you are. A husband who adores you, an amazing kid, and still you're always straightening every picture in the room. I never managed this, family. Here's my family, the people I grew up with, the people I loved and love. Don't take that away. Please don't take that away. You didn't answer the question. You didn't answer the question, Liz. Answer, somebody. Answer, or I'm going to call 9-1-1. What? What? I'm not kidding. I'll... I'll make the call. Oh, good. What will you say? I'm going to say there's been a suicide attempt, and that they need to come right away. Answer me, somebody! Do it. Anna. Honey, are you sure you want to do this? Honey? Jennifer. Put... put the phone down. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Of course they're having an affair. Of course they're having an affair. I begged them to have an affair. I implored them to have an affair. What? All our lives? Oh, no, no, no, no. Since I've been sick. How can that be OK? How could it be OK for my best friend and my husband to love each other? Don't you see that that makes a space so that I can do this? Don't you see? Love is everything. Love is all there is. Why didn't you tell us? Would you have approved? I'm sorry. It's OK. OK, now I'm scared. Of course you are. Me too. Look, maybe you all should... it's time. Now? Now. I'm... I'm done. I can feel it. I know it's coming toward me, and I do not want it. So if it's OK with you guys. Jen? Yeah. Anna? OK. But I want to be with you when you die. Anna. I don't... I don't think... Are you strong enough? Yeah. Yeah, she is. I'm with Anna. Just don't let me die with my mouth open. Oh, Mom. Now I'm frightened. Don't be frightened. Where am I going? You tell me, kiddo. I know you belong to somebody new, but tonight, you belong to me. What's next? Wait down... no. Although... Although, although we're apart, you're a part of my heart. But tonight, you belong to me. Just to little old me. ...old me. Wait down, wait down by the stream... Stream. How very, very, very sweet it will seem once more just to dream in the silvery moonlight, my honey, I know, I know, with the dawn that you will be gone, but tonight, you belong to me. Just to little ol' me.
