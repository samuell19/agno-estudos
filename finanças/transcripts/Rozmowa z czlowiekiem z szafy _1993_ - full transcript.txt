present in the film I am fine. I don't want change. I don't need any change. I don't need anything. I'd rather stay here, in my wardrobe. I came out the last time three months ago. Everything's fine as it is. I keep thinking about the old days at the house. I miss my mother. CONVERSATION WITH THE MAN IN THE WARDROBE based on a story by IAN McEWAN photography production manager written and directed by Hush, hush... my little Karol... My little treasure, mommy loves you... She was strange. Very strange. All twisted inside. I have it after her. After father died, she never mentioned him. Only me. Open up, nice... If you eat everything, I'll give you a strawberry. Come on, open up... Good... What did I say? First eat your grits. The strawberry is a reward for the nice boy. Remember, you can't take things by yourself. Why are you so naughty? Why are you so naughty? Do you like it? Just a bit more... Time to begin. ... After a long journey, the Red Riding Hood finally reached grandma's house. She slowly entered, came up to the bed and got frightened. Grandmother looked very strange. Red Riding Hood bent over the bed and saw the head of a terrible wolf. The wolf jumped out of bed, pounced on the Red Riding Hood and gobbled her up. When he was full, he went back into bed, pulled the blanket over himself, and started snoring... A brave hunter heard the wolf's snoring. He entered the grandmother's house... and bing! bang! He shot the wolf. From the wolf's belly the girl jumped out and poor, sick grandmother scrambled out. I was happy. I didn't know any other life. She was really good to me. Karolek, come, we'll have a bite. Come quick, quick. Hide in here. I didn't think I was going to make it. But I crawled up here somehow. Last week I went to see a doctor. I ran out of my prescription. Already last year he referred me to a sanatorium, but, Ms Ania, do I have the time? Do I have the time? Whole day on my feet. I'm parched. Thank you. It must have been some fruit. Not going to be easy! The damn thing won't come out. You know, my sister-in-law had a beautiful table cloth. Lacework. Age old. From her grandmother. And the kids smeared cherry jam all over it. And there you have it. Soap wouldn't work, baking soda wouldn't work, nothing worked. So she took it to the dry cleaner's. But the damn thing won't come out. You have... grown... He'll be starting school soon, won't he? If you fed him potatoes, meat, gave him some cream to drink, he would grow up to be a man. But now... What? Doesn't he have any teeth? I brought you something special. What do you say? You hear me? What do you say? Be a good boy and say 'thank you'. Say 'thank you'. No need to torment him. He'll learn, and if it isn't you, others will teach him. Well then. Sign here, please. Ms Ania... Why do you keep on like this? You're killing yourself. Such a beautiful young woman... and you live like a nun. You'd meet someone. It's always easier in a couple. And the boy would have a father. How much longer can you live on this miserly pension? One can tell right away this house needs a man. What do you say, Ms Ania? I'll better get going... What have you done? Remember... Remember never ever to take anything from strangers. This piece of candy is most certainly poisoned. Don't worry, Karol, mommy will soon be better. My God! Karol? What's wrong, Karol? Hush now... Ms Barcicka! I'm surprised I have to tell you such simple things which should be part of your daily routine. Your son is 8 years old and it's time he went school. Inspector... You must understand me... He... He's different... He's oversensitive... He must stay home. He's safe there. I won't let any harm come to him. He's weak, in poor health... Listen, you are behaving like a child. I have warned you about legal consequences, including termination of parental rights. I won't let any harm come to him. He is unwell. He has poor health. If the child is sick, there are special schools. But how can we help you, if you won't let anyone near the child? This boy must be examined. - A doctor has to determine... - Never... Do you understand? Never. Doctors will do more harm... They'll take him to the hospital. Have you ever been to a hospital? I don't him dying in a hospital! I don't want him dying in a hospital! 1...2...3...4...5...6 Channel One, Warsaw, it's eleven o'clock. Your turn. 1...2...3...4...5...6 I would like once, years later, once again, only once to return here, to this day. I would like one day, as I look through an old calendar to find this date, this very day whis is now passing before our eyes. Once again to take you by the hand to say 'I love you' and nothing else. I would like one day so very little only once turn back the time that carried us together. I would like one day to look more boldly into your eyes to take you in my arms, to feel the warmth of your... There's no one home. Hide in there, hide... Get out of here! Please calm down, Ms Barcicka! I'll kill myself! Sons of bitches, I'll kill myself! I'll kill him! I'll kill myself! Once upon a time the mother sat by her baby's cradle. She was very sad and worried that her baby would die. The child was weak, its eyes were closed, and breathed so faintly as if it only sighed. Suddenly, a knock on the door. An old man came wrapped in a horse blanket to warm up because it was a cold winter. The patriarch sat down and rocked the cradle. Karol, mommy has to go out. Promise you'll be a good boy and go to bed when the film is over. I'm not a grown-up. I don't want to be a grown-up. I hate grown-ups. It happened so suddenly. I didn't understand anything. I took refuge in the wardrobe, and she found it convenient. I died of fear a thousand times a day. I remember exactly, from one day to the next. The worst started. Karol, you have focus on what you're doing. Yesterday was much better. First of all, hold the spoon in your right hand. Why aren't you listening when I'm trying to help you? Listen, you're seventeen! Eat like a human, you hear, eat like a human! What's the problem, Karol? I told you I would be back shortly. - Don't go, mom! - There'll be a cartoon on TV. And then a children's film. - You like children's films... - I don't want you to... Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go of me, you hear?! Let me go! I'm sorry, such a mess... What did you do? Very good. Jasiek, please come in... That's my Karol I told you so much about. Hello! Darling, you must be tired. It's past your bedtime. ... old furniture always made me depressed. Especially that damned old wardrobe. It takes up half the room. And it's full of moths. And that strange smell. Can't get it out. There are some chemicals, they said so on TV. But around here, there's no place where to shop. I meant to buy some decent furniture... Pass me the glass. But everything's so expensive... You see yourself how I'm tied down... Somebody would have to carry it all upstairs Take care of everything... I don't have the energy. Oh, not now... Karol, come join us. Come out, you hear! Karol, get up! Stand like a human! Jasiek, please come in here... My dear... I wanted to tell you something very important. Jasiek who's been helping us in our difficult situation, has just become... well, you can call him daddy now... What's going on? What are you doing?! What are you doing?! What's happening?! It was as if I had died or someone had killed me. When it was over I saw the expression on their faces. They didn't say a word to me. They didn't even say a word to each other. When I guessed what they wanted to do to me, I cried. But then I was glad. I am sorry to say that at the present moment it is hard to imagine he will be able to fill the gaps in his education We've no doubt that your son is a well-mannered, intelligent young man... I am certain that in our institution he will learn many useful things that will allow him to go far in life . . . Come on, brother. Over here. Sit down. Remember. This is your bed. In this cupboard you can arrange your things. Don't worry. It will all work out. You'll get used to it. Beginnings are the worst. Anyway, you're an adult. They won't keep you long. One, two. One, two. All together. Wide circles. Good. Keep going. Wide circles. Over by the ladders, wide circles. Good. Legs wide apart. Your weight on one arm. And lower, backs straight. Keep your backs straight. Now the other leg. Lower. Barcicki, the other leg. Lower, lower. Backs straight. Harder, harder! Over here! The institution wasn't bad. I didn't care where I was. What mattered was that I met Kowalski. Kowalski is an ordinary name. But he was extraordinary. Really extraordinary. You hear? Close your eyes and listen carefully. At one point. . . you will feel warmth and a desire to move. You will keep your eyes closed. But you will start moving. It will be a dance. Music that's within you. The world doesn't exist. Only you and music exist. Don't be afraid, you hear?! Don't be afraid. Don't give up! You must fight! You must be strong! You must fight! Fight for yourself! You must not lose! That's why you must fight! "In the end, however, "it happened . . ." "In the end, however, it happened..." ". . .it so happened that. . ." ". . .after a long journey. . ." ". . . across the sand . . ." " . . . rocks and snow . . ." "after a long journey across the sand, rocks, and snow..." "the Little Prince. . ." "discovered a path. . ." "discovered a path..." "The Little Prince discovered a path." Full stop. Close your eyes and don't be afraid. Move a couple steps closer to the tree. Good. Stop here. You're standing under a tree. Don't be afraid. Embrace it. And put your ear to the trunk. You will hear a sound. A peaceful, soft sound that contains life. This tree will protect you. You're safe. This tree is your friend. The world is your friend. I can say with satisfaction, my dear friends, that you have learned a lot. And I believe you are ready to enter adult life. On behalf of the whole faculty, I wish you much success and satisfaction. Now allow me to distribute your diplomas. Slawomir Grabski. Karol Barcicki. Marian Gorzalek. You are a bright and good boy. I would like your life to turn out well. You know there's no use going home. If you want to, go, but there's no use. You must learn to live on your own. You must be tough. Don't let yourself be hurt. Here's a place where you can stay. It's always better in a big city, you understand? What can I do for you? I'd like to see my mother. I'm sorry but you must have the wrong address. I'm sure this is it. My mother lives here. I'd like to see her. If you mean the previous tenants, they moved out a year ago. They didn't leave a forwarding address. But please come in, perhaps when my father's back... Wait! Such a good room for next to nothing... That's too bad... Well, love, come here. Hold my doggy. Don't be afraid... There. Yes, a room like that is a bargain. Right in the center. Come on in, love. Come on, love. Sit down next to me and rest. Becaus . . . See . . . I've something important to tell you. I have a family, you know? Wonderful, look. That's my daughter, Zosia. She has such a profound gaze... And over here, look, my son-in-law. An engineer. And here's my granddaughter. Her name is Patrycja. And she can speak English. They have a car. . . Volvo. And they come very often, because they care about me a lot... And they bring all sorts of gifts... Good morning... Good morning... What are you doing! Use the window! I'm sorry, young man, but the job market . . . There is nothing we can do for you. Of course, you're entitled to unemployment benefits which we wil send to the address on file... And then... What can I tell you... Afterwards.. It's a complicated situation... You just have to keep looking on your own... That's that. Boil water for tea! Where's that water? Cabbage and peas. He barely started, and already tossing pots? I had warned that we shouldn't hire him. He can't even scrub pots. Little prick conceived on a window sill. Clean up that mess! And then, the desperate mother reached an enormous lake. She cried... because she didn't know how to get across. "There is nothing you can do without my help," said the lake. "I like collecting pearls, "and your eyes are the clearest pearls "I have ever seen. "Cry them out into me "and I will carry you across." . . . A real home, a real roof. Chicken soup! Confit de canard! Crappy job, my friend. Crappy job. You call this clean? Do it over again. High time you learned how to do your job. You came here to work, not to recover. Don't worry, I'll teach you a thing or two. Since your parents taught you nothing, strangers will. Our kitchen must be spotless. Fuck off you pighead. Then the mother encountered a strange woman. It was an old gravedigger keeping watch over the deathhouse. "Help me find my child," implored the mother. "I will," agreed the old woman. "But in return, you will give me your beautiful hair." Then they entered a large building and the woman said: "This is the deathhouse. "Here, people are like plants. "Except that they have beating hearts." The desperate mother inspected each plant and among millions, recognized her child's heart. I'm glad you're here, my friend. I've got a big job for you. You're toiling over dishwashing, perhaps you'll be better at something else. Grab a basin and a brush, you'll scrub the oven. Pans are getting stuck to it. Kaska, give him a basin and a brush, and off to the oven. Stop staring, you klutz. Hop in! Move it, move it! We don't have whole day! Unless you're planning to spend the night. Don't cry, my darling. Look. What is this? Look at the pretty sun. See how our friend warmed up to dishwashing. I get it. Me, too, I'd rather stand still and keep my hands in warm water. Alas, you did a shoddy job yesterday. You forgot the basic rule of our kitchen: Whatever you do, do it well. Roll up your sleeves, and back to the oven. Boss is coming. Let me out! Can't you see it's getting burned? Let me out, you pig! What are you doing, can't you stir? If I didn't stir, it would get stuck to the bottom. Let me out! You son of a bitch, let me out! Three times, haddock filet. White cabbage. Four times pancackes. Five times beef rolls. Get out. Come, Karol. Slowly, Karol. Don't worry, you'll get better. It'll be all right, you'll see, Karol. Slowly, slowly, Karol. You'll see, everything will be all right. Don't worry, you'll be better tomorrow. Suddenly, a cold wind started blowing. The mother understood it was death approaching. "I'm giving you your eyes back," said death. "Now look into this deep well." And the mother looked. And she saw two lives. Two human fates. One life was goodness and blessing. And the other was worry and misery. "Know," said death, "that one of them "was your child's fate. "The future of your own child." "Which one was my child?" "I can't tell you that," said death. "Do you want your child, or should I take it away?" The mother fell to her knees and cried. And death, with her child in his arms, went away into the unknown. Go home. We'll do without you. Take a day off. Boss will let you. All right. Careful. Having fun without me? Sometimes I wish the wardrobe would disappear. I pass my days and nights in here. In the morning, I don't feel like leaving. I hate going out. I need my mother. I want to climb into my baby stroller. I want to be one year old. But that won't happen. I know it.
