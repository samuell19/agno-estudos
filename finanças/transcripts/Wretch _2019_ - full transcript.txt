Nat? Dyatt Chennn! Nat! Oh sh-I'm sorry. Oh so sorry. Okay. Okay. All right. Flourish crew, time to flourish. Stick 'em up, stitches later, okay up now. En-cel-a-dism. Ugh, I hate hospitals. Oh, here, sorry. I'm sorry. Well you're never gonna forget 30 days sober. I don't care about that. You should. I've been in a lot of kitchens, 30's tough. You gotta own it. Adam's supposed to get his results today. How's your meditation coming? Did you get a chance to get the text? Dude. I bet that blast of delicious energy felt good though huh? Here. It's better to receive it as a gift anyway. So now that's your autographed copy. He's Irish but he lives north of KC now. I met him at Prosperos. He channeled the whole text. He's a genius. We've been emailing each other. I told him about you because there's some stuff in here about the pain body and second sight and sounds like your glitches. Book changed my life, no doubt. Were you holding that 'til you started the car? What? Soup of the day was definitely mushroom. Please. Hey, Adam, come on back. Look at Sadie. She looks like her auntie. Right? Adam still hasn't texted. Now his appointment was at 11. He will. Don't worry. Aleah, did you guys still want to... Yeah. - Hi, I'm Nat. - Hi, Nat. I'm an alcoholic. I'd like to thank my best friend, Aleah, for being my sponsor. She's generous and more patient than I deserve. I can't remember the last time that I was 30 days without drinking. I get this recurring vision of a bloody face. I've had 'em all my life but when I drink it doesn't happen as much so. I don't know if you're supposed to get crazy dreams when you stop drinking but I had a dream last night I was in my high school bathroom and the guy next to me was peeing. But instead of a regular dick, he had like a... Flesh... disc. like a garbage can lid and he asked me to help him hold it up so he could pee. I mean pee was leaking from it like a pizza cr... Thanks Nat. Hey. I got you a fish. Her name is Silver. I'm scared. I can't even give me four months without drama. I told you I was trouble. No you said "troubled" so I was like hmmmm... Chemo, that sounds gross, chemo. You don't have to call it that. Call it therapy. I was angry at you today. I wouldn't have gone to the doctor if you didn't make me. It wasn't a hickey. I'm proud of you. Thank you. I was Jesse's age when dad died. I remember hugging my mom on my bed when she cried. She doesn't deserve this again. No one gets cancer on purpose. It doesn't matter. They're your family. They love you no matter what. I'm not scared of dying, I just don't want to. You are not going to die. I love you, Nat. ♪ Happiness Miss Piggy ♪ ♪ One caress, Miss Piggy ♪ ♪ All the world's ever wanted was you ♪ ♪ A dream come tr- ♪ En-cel-aaaaa Encel-aaaahhhhh ♪ Encela....Enceladism ♪ ♪ Encela-dism ♪ Good morning! Jesse, wash your hands, dinner's ready. Wash your hands. What's for dinner? You were dreaming. What did you dream about? Hell. Mom said cancer's a demon from hell. There's no such place. Yeah, there is. Honey, hell is just the absence of love and you never have to worry about that. I can feel my soul trying to leave my body. Your body's healing. Do a meditation with me. Breathe with me. Thank you, Lord, for the food you have set before us and thank you for this beautiful day. And may we continue to be worthy of your wondrous blessings. I think he'll rest well. See you tomorrow Anna. Hey. He needs rest. He's resting. He needs more rest. So he'll rest and I see him tomorrow. No, you won't. What? You were in there everyday for a month. It's absurd, you don't live here. I never said tha- - This is a Christian household. He wants me her... I don't want you in my house. What the fu... Don't, do not. He is sick, not diseased. I don't want you seeing my son. Do you understand me? I don't want you in my house. This is my house. I ran over my little girl's dog and I didn't stop. I didn't stop but I looked in that rearview mirror. I had a little buzz too. And I saw that little toe-headed six-year-old kid gettin' smaller and smaller and smaller in my rearview mirror. I never went back. I never, ever went back. And I sent her a card on her graduation. Never heard a thing. I tried to call her when she got married. Wouldn't take my call. But her mom called me and said, "You're an old drunk. Don't ever reach out to her again. You scarred her and the rest of us because all you wanted to do is drink." And that's one thing I did very well. I told you, I hadn't hit rock bottom and I still haven't hit rock bottom because I'm runnin' from it. Aleah! Aleah, excuse me, I'm Jimmy. Hi, Jimmy. I'm new. Right on. - Yeah, right. - Yeah. I'm Jimmy. Ow, my hand! Are you okay? Are you on Facebook? Uh, what? - You have bubba skin. - Thanks. This was my first meeting. Awesome. Shut up. Do you hear that?

I should go. No, no, no, no, I cleaned your pee. It's not like you're a prisoner. just outside in the open air. Did you grab my phone? I didn't see it. Okay this, is volume two. The handbook, my handbook. Okay well we'll smudge it, smudge it. Enceladism is truth. I should call Aleah. You know I was sitting, last night with you in my heart and Adam in my heart and thinking and sending healing energy and And I was just thinking, Adam doesn't need to suffer. Nat doesn't need to suffer, right? I mean Listen to your heart, Jean! Like like like Jefferson Starship. Or, I think Jefferson Starship? The moment I met you, I knew you were a healer like me. I gonnna I'm gonna cry. Your visions are the pain body trying to break free! You can transcend the suffering in this world and really help people. And Adam getting cancer and you getting sober, the timing is divine. There is nothing accidental! Spirit shows us when it is time to take things to the next level. Awaken to your higher purpose. Everything will be all right. Aleah? Aleah? Don't open your eyes. I'm disgusting. If you're not ready to quit, it's fine. Just don't shut me out and don't run off with ass Chad in Ames. You're my family and I need you to be here for me too, especially when fucked up shit like this happens. You have no idea how they got in? No. Just get a phone. Get like a little burner or something and call me with the number, okay? You and my sister and Sadie are all I have left. I'm just trying to keep it together too, you know? I love you. I love you too. Da ta! You like it? I didn't know you could draw I can?. This is gonna be just like our usual meditation, just a little more, okay? This is an herbal tea with some mild psychotropic agents. It's vegan. Oh, wait, don't drink the whole... Oh, it's hot. Well, I was, we were gonna share that but... What am I gonna die now? No. Oxygen amplifies the breath to purify the lymph. Love is like oxygen Now I want you to go straight back, open to flow. ♪ Little shop, little shop of horrors ♪ Okay now the breath of fire is gonna activate the crown chakra, okay? And I want you to send all your healing energy to Adam with your intention. Alright, let that breath purify your blood. Blood carries a unique power. It is the living imprint of our intention. Thoughts radiate out as golden globes of energy. Thoughts, become things. Mom! C'mon, c'mon, c'mon baby! Adam! C'mon, no don't. Oh, God, c'mon baby. No, don't die! Don't die, don't fuckin' die on me please! C'mon, c'mon, stay with me! Hi! Hi hi it's Jean. I. I fucked up. Nat? Oh, you scared me. Nat, this is Pete. Good morning, Nat. His is Pete. Good morning, Nat. Pete. Good morning, Nat. This is Pete , this is Pete. Papa. It sounded like he said papa. He's still pretty stoned, he's still pretty stoned. May I get you a cool glass of water? Hey. You can understand me, right? Thank you for not dying. I chickened out I'm sorry. I started thinking about going to jail so I called Pete but he came right away. Can you believe it? Pete, from the books. He's the one that wrote the books! You've been asleep for two days but you're fine. Please be respectful. I should go check on the shop. Would you stay with him? Of course. Pete's gonna keep an eye on you. Okay would you please? Fazem He's so stoned Mild lopho, yeah? Temporary paralysis is common. but that aura. I was beginning to think you were all extinct. See ya. Yeah. Is there anything you need while I'm out? Do you need anything? Flately He said your toilet tissue is too sandpapery and have you anything softer? Sure, okay. I'll just be for a few hours. Pete, thank you. I still can't believe you're here! There you are. How is everything? Very good, thank you. Oh, sweetie, you have a little something stuck in your teeth there. Up, yeah. It's a little beef. - Nice. - You're down at 23. Heard Good afternoon, welcome to Voltaire. I'm having trouble reading the menu. Sit down and help me read. Is this the beef sandwich? Yeah, which, which... Sweetie, you've a little something stuck in your teeth. There. Beef. Give me a towel! Aleah! You know to get that energy build up in my chest, you know. - Yeah. - Yeah, you know. It's like go up through the diaphragm. You know that punch. And release. Fascinating. Jean, I was thinking next week is the solstice. I could stay until then and then maybe you could process. Are you serious? When I first met you, your energy stayed with me. And lately I've- Are you okay? What's wrong? I've fallen out of my master's favor. I'm... D-Y-I-N-G. What? No, no way. But I... You're so young! And so handsome too, right? We don't choose Encedalism, it chooses us. I was nine when I swallowed my destiny. It's long and lonely when you have the truth inside you, you know? But when Encendalists process, there's nothing like it. Blood communion, every cell in the body rejuvenates and the work can go on. I spent my entire life in service, seeking those gifted ones ready to awaken to their higher purpose, their inner healer. Jean, the world needs Encedalism now more than ever, not more poison and cutting. After you've processed, you'll be able to train others when I'm gone. Hey, what about Nat? What about Nat? He's gifted, right? You said he was an alcoholic. Well but he had 30 days before his relapse. It's dangerous to tempt an addict with this power. Please. We can do it together. He trusts me! His partner is dying of cancer. I told him I'd help. In Gaelic we call it babhláil I help Nat, so maybe you can help me? Deal! What? Good morning, papa. Hey, how you feeling? Hey hey hey! Time it is? Ummm I don't know, Ten-ish. What? Eight. Who's he? That's Pete. Hey, you want some rice? No, I want to see Adam. Honey, you should really rest. No, he should rest. It's... Jean! I'll leave the door unlocked! Oh! Let him. Hi! Hi. Shhh! What are you doing? I wanted to see you. I called you. How you feel? I feel better. Talk to me. Uhhh... on Sunday I got really sick. I was throwing up this, like, black vomit. It was crazy. Mom wanted to go to the hospital but I felt like I just needed to sleep. And I slept for like fourteen hours and I didn't have any nightmares. When I woke up I felt... different. Where have you been? That's awesome. God is awesome. That's awesome. Have you been drinking? You smell like booze. That's what God smells like. Nat? Everything's gonna be alright. Cassette is better than MP3. Okay, we're diving deep. No time to waste sit up straight, visualize the form, call out the disease. Jean and I will be right here. ♪ Encel-a, Encel-a-dism ♪ Focus intention. Harness the power to heal. Are you kidding me? Feel the power! Yes man! Yes! Get out of the fuckin' way! Don't! Touch her.

Don't get it on my pants. Did you call her mom, ma, or mother? Mom. Can you feel that? Yeah. That's your father stuck in there. Yeah. He was gifted like you But he was a coward. You'll be a powerful Encedalist. I'm only doing this to help Adam. When he's better, I'm done. She wants to be important. Don't look. She's jealous of you. Jean's good to me. She wants to fuck you. Nat. Let go! I speak my mind, I can't bullshit. Encedalism is truth. But if you're unstable, people could get hurt. I'm not a social worker but I can help. I don't need your help. Give it a rest. I know what you want, I know what you are and it's natural. You'll save Adam's life, you will! But you could save so many others. It's your purpose and you need to own it But we need to do the work.
