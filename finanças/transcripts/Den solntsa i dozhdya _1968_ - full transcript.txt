A rectangular rectangle... Perpendicular... Sit down. 2. - Children, who can do it? - Mukhin, of course. Kronov! I didn't do anything. Indeed, you have done nothing, not now, not during the entire school year. Mukhin, please. In a right triangle, the perpendicular I'm not translating all this. Kronov! Get out right now. Leave the briefcase, please. Trolleybus. Faster, faster. Go on, Mukhin. - Stand up! - Why are you in front of me, you're shorter. Attention! What, are you bothered? You know, I'm tired of it, better leave before you're in trouble. - Will you complain to the teacher? - I will. - You won't do that. You're a coward. - Like that. What's going on here? Mukhin, what's the matter? Kronov should stand behind me, he's shorter. - Really, why are you standing here? - I've always stood here. This is the place! March to the left flank! Look at that, Uncle Styopa over here. Listen, we need to do something with Mukha for this. I'll tie his ears behind his head. Or maybe I'll strangle him. Haven't decided yet. Or maybe... A DAY OF SUN AND RAIN No, not worth it. He won't get away with it. Coming. Hello, Mukhin. - All clear? - No, nothing is clear. What's the matter, actually? Let's go. It'll be clear to him now. Chickened out, huh? Fool, it hurts! I will destroy you! By the hair, huh? By the hair, like a girl! Yes, school has already started. Go, go, or you'll face the principal too, go. Look, he's going! What a guy! Everyone was let go, and he's alone going to school. Why let go? Why why? So clueless. Trolleybus got sick, that's why. You're lying. Come here. Or I'll show you! Seen this? Go, then. Here's a treasure. Father gave me breakfast money. Take it, you'll be the finance minister. - No way. - Here. We'll have a peace day. Take your money. What are you doing there? Danger! Why whistle so early? I do not understand. It's recess too. - What kind of watch do you have? - "Rocket". Showing seconds. Dad also wanted to get me these. But I refused. The hell I need such luxury for? Personally, I'd just think about how not to break them. But he bought me an orange for 1.5 roubles per kilo! Not cheap either, you know. Listen, Kronov, give me your word that school was canceled today. You don't throw words around on such trifles. Look at that! Here, here! My word. You think it's really nice for me to skip the test, huh? You're so distrustful, it's just awful. This is a madhouse. There are bars on the windows. Why? For seizures. So that they don't throw themselves out of the window. Mind you, sometimes it comes over me too. What's the matter with you? That's who needs to be in a madhouse. Almost bit my leg through. Get your pants dirty! I'll fall! Mukha, have you ever kissed? I think I did. But with whom? From our class? Why are you so shy? It really disadvantages you. Have you thought about it? Of course. But this year I decided to change my character by 180 degrees. That's why I acted like that during PE. You see, I had to start somewhere. Otherwise I would have stopped respecting myself. Please don't be angry with me. Everyone thinks you're a bad student, but I think you're a capable guy. I can help you. With geometry, for example. I was also a good student once. Well, in elementary school. Is it hard to get good grades? Well, how can I say... The main thing is the system. Decided to do something - do it every day. For example, I decided to strengthen my memory, so every day I memorise English texts, poems. You asked if it's hard to get good grades? It is. It's hard to be a good student in general. It's strange, but nobody likes good students. Maybe that's why I've never had friends. And still don't, in fact. MOVIE TICKETS - Girls, which row are you in? - We won't say. 16th. Are the tickets expensive? I haven't been to a movie in ages. I've already watched this movie. Listen, can we not go? Wasting money on them. You fell in love, not me. The girls aren't great either. - Maybe we should try the other way? - I can't do the other way. Then go, finance minister, pay up. Is there enough money? Probably. Listen, just take the 16th row. Miss, I can't see anything because of you. Please take off your hat. A giant woman! Should I escort you out? Had one do that. What an outrage! - These boys are messing around. - Get out! The youth of today! We came to see a movie, we got the tickets! Give me a plaintive book, look at those legs kicking! Whatcha staring at? Do you want to eat? I do. Damn beggar. When I was your age, I earned my own bread. Well, come on here. Skipping school? Yes. A painting: two slackers feeding a third. What kind of painting is this? By an unknown artist. Aren't you at all interested in school? Why? Recess is interesting. Let's go. 35-48 - My father's car. - He's a taxi driver? Can he give us a ride? A ride? He's never taken ME for a ride. - Dad! - Are you in the woods or something? Come here. We need to buy a basin in the Passage, the home store. Son, here's the money, or we'll have nothing to wash with. You'll have to wash the socks yourself now. I'll give you change, our registry swears when we hand over the change. Take it, a treat from a passenger. Where does such luxury come from? From Tbilisi, of course. Share it with your friend. He's an excellent student! Excellent student! Why are you wandering around the city then? Our teacher got sick, unfortunately. "Unfortunately!". The devils. Svetlana never came home. One good sister you have. If she appears, let her hand over the key. Hand over the key right away! Let her never appear in the house! Hand over the key, the stilyaga! Hear me? I'm not deaf! Of course I do. Dad, don't be so nervous. You'll get me killed like this. - How much does it cost? - 6.50. Not cheap. Can you show me... The yellow one please. - Does the bow go at the front? - Yes. Put it on a little bit down. Here is a familiar girl. - Where? - There, eating a pastry. I think she went to our school. She did, but dropped out. - How do you know that? - I think I know my sister. She's your sister? Let's go over to her. Miss! Why are you shouting across the Passage? - Not your sister, then. - Mine, I said. You're afraid to approach your own sister. - Father and I are not talking to her. - Why? Because she's a psycho. She dropped out of school, started smoking, didn't spend several nights at home, and yesterday she left altogether. But father won't let her go back anymore. - You heard how he said to take the key from her? So, that. - Good thing, if she's like that. She drove dad insane. Father's job is terribly stressful. The passengers are also not nice, you know. Dad comes home and keeps silent. And mom? Mom ran away to Kazakhstan, with some officer. She just ditched you? I don't remember, I was little. She now has her own family there. I have a sister there too, also in Kazakhstan, thank god we're not blood related. I see you're embarrassed to carry it, right? No, it's just kind of uncomfortable. Fine, hand it over if you're so shy. Come to my place, see how I live. Kron! Show what you bought. Oh, a basin! - Going to wash up? - Don't say. Sister didn't sleep at home, after all? She sure went wild, like Carmen. Are you crazy? What, are you scared? Where are you going? Get down. You'll fall and I'll be to blame. What? I smacked his head so hard with the basin I think he got a fever. Why are you smoking? It's bad. Got nervous. I don't really smoke. You don't inhale it? Oh, see the kitty on the roof? I think it's a cat. You're a cat. Come here, what are you afraid of. She's shy. - Whose is it? - Nobody's. So smart. We often talk, about life. She's proud, feeds herself. Any domestic cat dreams of being full, and is ready to sell themselves for a piece of sausage, and this one does not suck up to anyone. An independent fella. - Did you go to the sauna? - No, I bought it in the Passage. - A cheerful apartment. - They're sending Gena Snegiryov off to the army. - A neighbor? - Neighbour. Partying for two days in a row now. Psychos! - A piece broke off. - It was like that. Yeah, sure! If it was, I wouldn't have bought it. How much do we earn, thousands or something? Sunshine! Oh, my god, finally. Who is this queen of spades? She's an actress. - From a failed theater. - Hush! My little cupid! The sun is so splendid today! It's furious, cool. A real wonderful summer. We need a basin for both. Look at this thing. Now wash your socks! When I was little, I was bathed in such a small basin! Mom, invite Irina Sergeyevna. - Irina Sergeyevna, can you have a glass? - No, merci, I have a shooting at Lenfilm today. - This one is light. - No, I never drink before filming. This is the law. The holiest of laws. Irina Sergeyevna! - What, darling? - Read something. Yes, really. Please do, Irina Sergeyevna. At the request of the young warriors. And their battle girlfriends! Turgenev, "The fathers are here". There is a small rural cemetery in one of the remote corners of Russia. Like almost all of our cemeteries, it had a sad appearance. The canals surrounding it have long been overgrown. The gray crosses are drooping and rotting under their once painted roofs. The stone slabs have all shifted, sheep wander around the graves freely. But among them, there is one grave that is not touched by man, which is not trampled by an animal. Only birds perch on it and sing at dawn. An iron fence surrounds it. Evgeny Bazarov is buried in this grave. Two elderly people often come here from a distant village: husband and wife, supporting each other, they walk with a heavy gait. They will approach the fence, fall down to their knees, and cry heavy tears for a long time. They gaze long, attentively, at the mute stone under which their son lies. Are their tears and prayers not omnipotent? Sorry, I forgot. I'm forgetting everything now. My head is full of holes. I completely forgot that I now have to go to the store for vegetable oil before filming. - Don't worry, we'll do it. - Really? Oh, thank you! Young warrior! Serve properly. - Goodbye! - Thank you, Irina Sergeyevna! Thank you, today I have such an important shooting. Kronov. - Who is it? - My friend, the little fly. How wonderful it is, how good it is to have a friend. How wonderful it is to have a friend. Is she always this worried? She's a real actress. She's beautiful, isn't she? I always worry too. Especially before tests. - It's strange, but this morning I believed you. - In what? Well, that there was no test today, that Trolleybus got sick and all. There was indeed a test. Now I won't believe you, don't think I'm that naive. Anybody called me? What am I, a reference bureau? Aren't we going to be late to the store? I need to get the keys from her. If father said so. She will soon go on duty at her pharmacy anyway. Let's go dance, we can grab a bite too. Leave the keys, father said. Keys? Anything else you need? Let me in, it's mine! I live as I want! What's the matter? Go watch your TV. What a lady! Princess! Stand up! Lost your mind. My bed. This is my room too. I'm registered here. Tomorrow I will put a plywood partition here, I'll show father and you! He tormented mom out of the house, now it's my turn! What a psycho! It won't work. I will report him to the police. Give me the keys anyway. Here. Choke on your keys. Well, heard it all? Yes. God forbid to have such a sister. You have a nice room. We have a separate apartment, but it's worse. The ceilings are low. Yes, but they say our house will be demolished soon. Here. Do you know how much I don't want to move into a new apartment? Are you going to another school? Without me. Why do I need you? You don't let me copy homework, you know. Don't touch it, it's not mine. Here are some good records. We used to live here too. Only in the basement. Svetka is such an oddball. Some guy sees her off. He asks where is your window. And she'd choose the one with the most beautiful lampshade, pointed with her finger. She was embarrassed of the basement, can you imagine? This summer we went to the village with her, with my father. She catches fish so well! - Your father? - Yes. - Fought? - Yes, went through the whole war. - There are so many medals. - That's something else. Have you seen this? - He doesn't wear them. - Why? No one does, so he doesn't. Is he special or something? But how many of them walk around Leningrad, and we don't know? We don't even know each other. Well, let's go, or we'll really be late. Here's my record. Svetka gifted it to me. I think I'll sell it, for the sake of such a day. I have a waiter, an acquaintance, he wanted to buy it for a long time. Is that actress working in drama or just...? She used to play in silent films, and the sound killed her. That's what she says. How did it kill? It's very simple, everything worked out in silent film, but then something went wrong with sound. Well, why, she reads so well, with expression. That's her starting to forget, too. Gena's older brother also died recently. Very young. The factory gave him a tombstone with a star. Everything was great. Like that. A man lives, and then here comes the coffin. Have you thought about the fact that we will also die someday? What nonsense! And I did. You know, sometimes it comes over me. It's not that you get sick; you get sick and get well. But no matter what you do, you will die anyway. I thought that once, and then I couldn't do anything all week. - And then? - What then? Nothing. Got used to it. A person gets used to everything. Here, put it in your briefcase. "Leave the briefcase, please"! Okay, it will come in handy. I'll put the oil in there. You'll get all dirty. It's slippery on the street, and then it's already hard for her to walk in heels. - Is she a decorated actress? - No. I think she's wearing make up. Her eyelashes are glued on. What! - Are they not? - Try saying that she has a wig and a nose glued on. - Is that all? - Yes. No kopecks left. Why do we need matches? They will be useful in the household. Right. Wait a minute! Open up. Please. Show yours. Self-service, huh. You just turn around here and half the store will be taken out. They pay for salt but put cocoa in the bag! Do you search everyone like that? You're still a snot. I have the right to search you from head to toe! All the best. Boy, come back. Do you want to go to the police? Show me what's in your pocket. Don't you stare at me like that! I'm not timid! Damn thief! - Don't let him go, please, it's his friend. - Fine. Detain him! - What happened? - Come on, take your hand out. Come on! Do you ever sell oranges? - What happened? - Nothing happened. Come on, come on, citizens, nothing happened, come on. - Boy! - Me? Do you want to be in a movie? - No, I don't want to. - Why? - It's interesting. - I don't want to. You will have a role, you will see yourself on screen. - And who will he play? A juvenile delinquent? - Not witty. Well, let's go. Don't play hard to get, boy. No, I'm not going without this guy. We're late. Go ahead. I'm not suitable. What's wrong with him? Look now - take off your glasses. What a smart, noble face. And an excellent student, by the way. Since you have such a friendship, then let's go together. Go. Let's go faster, I'm without lunch today. Hold on to me. I've been to Lenfilm before. - You have? - Oh, as an extra and such. They shoot movies by our house all the time. They filmed The Prologue, Obukhovtsy. If they bring firewood - it means filming. - And what does firewood have to do with it? - Building barricades. Do you know one bald guy working here? - What bald man? We have a lot of bald men. - The one on the set saying: you're wounded, you're dead. - Dead? - Well, whoever is dead - is dead, and whoever is wounded - is wounded. I was playing dead there, the horror. The boys and I will fall down and laugh. We were young. Here we are. Ready to shoot. AT DAWN Please check the hotel bill, okay? And that the train is also paid, I'm sitting without a penny now, okay? Misha, are we bothering you? But this is also important, by the way. I understand. Tamara, what's our take? 13th. Start. 75 take 13. There's more than one cartridge in the pistol There's more than one blond man in Odessa But believe me that Mishka Yaponchik Is of course one of a kind In my life I knew, I knew a lot of beauties I'm not complaining, life is good If only some scoundrel won't believe me; We'll crush him, and sha! Gentlemen, I am a king, not a fool, That's why I live light In order to do business well It is necessary to have something up there A free slacker will not deceive me That is my soul If someone- if someone gets in my way I'll crush you like a bug - and sha! Oh wow! Come closer, measure my strength, But say goodbye to the family I screwed it. I'm so sorry. Can I do a second one right away? Start. 153 take 5. Come closer, measure my strength, But say goodbye to the family I do not feel sorry for your artery fluid I'm sorry to get my hands dirty The Moldavian woman predicts success to me As I'm approaching a case The police- the police chief doesn't want to interfere If he wants to, we will crush him, and sha! I screwed it again. Thank you, girls. Keep the light on, please. Okay, cut. Is there anything for a headache? - Is that Kozakov? - What Kozakov? - Well, the Amphibian Man. Turn off the lights, come on. Break. Oh my god! How elegant. I knew it would be like this. I always knew. We bought you oil, and matches instead of change. Matches. We didn't want to take them, but there was no change. Thank you, thank you, my little cupid. Thank you for everything. A good boy, but the makeup is bad. He's got some kind of face... Trolleybus face. Who is this? Come here. Come on. He looks like Griboyedov. Take off your glasses. Well that's much better, and he's taller too. Dress him up. - Where are you going? - They poured oil all over me, I can't work like this. - Vera Kholodnaya got oil spilled on her. - Maybe the shooting will be canceled? That'd be great, thanks Vera! What idiot brought oil on set? - I warned you. - What is it? - Here, go explain yourself. - What's the matter? Is this your job? Yes, this is my oil. That is, I put it here. I warned her, but she's some kind of...! You take god knows who off the street, and then you're surprised - "some kind of"! I'm not off the street, young man. I'm an actress. What kind of a goddamn actress! Actress in vegetable oil. And yet I'm an actress. I worked with Vera Kholodnaya, whom you have depicted here with such vulgarity and unlikeness. I worked with Eisenstein. I came here as a girl. Cinematography... All my life I breathed with it. Lived with it. And the ones like you are slowly turning it into a farce. Who lets such people into the studio? We can tear up her acting pass, by the way! You can tear up the pass, but I am not leaving from here. I will be carried out of here feet first, only when I die. Apologize now. You have insulted a wonderful person. Listen, old man, Never talk like in bad youth plays. Not worth it. But insulting, humiliating a person - is it worth it? I'm asking you - is it worth it? Kron, I'm off. Hi. It's cold. How's life? I tried calling your sister, can't get through. Has she married yet? Well, what do you want? There's a thing. Heavily used. - What do you want? - Can you cook up a little banquet? Why? Doesn't matter. Actually, we don't let youngsters in after six. Okay, come on in. Go to that hall, only on the right. Just make sure the chef doesn't notice, okay? I don't remember if someone told me or I read it somewhere. A boy lived by the seashore. He was friends with a dolphin. And so every morning he came to the shore, sat on a dolphin and sailed along the shore on his back to school like on a boat. And then one day the boy did not come, and the dolphin crashed against the rocks out of anguish. Here is a true devoted friend. If only we had them in class. Would you have done the same? Maybe, or maybe not, I don't know. But they were betrayed. I myself read how one dolphin, while dying, said in pure English that they were betrayed. Stuffy, isn't it? Shall we go for a walk on the deck? Do you feel the rocking? What a doorman is here, such a beard! Tsar Saltan. Something weird is happening with me. For some reason, it seems to me that that woman over there is exactly like our Trolleybus. She really looks like her. Damned glasses. Kronov, please look. That's her, right? That's her. Interesting. So there were lessons. Now I understand everything. You made a bet with the whole class to make me skip school. Dragged me into that stupid basement on purpose. Well done. Bravo. I was a fool to believe. You played me like a boy. Very, very witty. Well done. I didn't know you were such a scumbag. Talking about dolphins and all. Traitor. That's who you are. Are you cold? Come on in. I'm after you. Why? You got the keys. I'm going to stay with a friend for the time being. Come on, Sveta, father will go crazy. - Don't forget, Sveta, you have night duty tomorrow. - Yes, thank you, I remember. Wow, working at night even. What did you think? That's how I didn't come home. For two days. I was on duty. Dad and you have your brains backwards. Is that it? Go. Get dressed. I'll wait. - Coughing for long? - Is it even a cough? We'll get a raise by New Year. We'll buy you shoes. Just study. Who are you going to call? One boy. Better call father, be decent. He won't sleep all night, tomorrow morning he's on duty. Don't want to. Why did you hang up the phone? You've become so weird. - Don't recognise me? - Why, I do. - Is this your little brother? - Yes, what's the matter? It's a long story. Don't be mad at the cashier. You know, everything happens during the day. My mood also tanked for the whole day after that orange. Why do you have no hat in such weather? You know, I'll call dad. He's my father, after all. Excuse me. Your friend is calling. Mom, why can't you imagine that I skipped school? I just did it. Just like that. You're alone, you're alone Getting wet in the rain The two of us will take shelter Under a sun umbrella If you want, I'll peel an orange After all, it is divided into slices So that I don't eat alone.
