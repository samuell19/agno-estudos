Thanks. Yes... I'm outside. I followed him. I guess he needed to stretch his legs. It's the end of the day. No. We're 2 minutes away. I'll direct him toward the office. He's back. It's OK. I love that. Watching them leave one by one. It makes me calm and serene. My little staff. I'm joking. I'm joking, Graham. Come closer before judging me. Then you'll understand. There he is. Time for Fred and his video screens. Have you met Fred? No. Do you know I take African dance? I think I'll be going. Take off your clothes, Graham. Are you sure? Take them off. No, no... Not the shirt. Make yourself comfortable in my chair. - Are you sure? - Trust me, it's the only way you come. It surprises you every time. Nevertheless... That camera! It's OK, I covered the lens. See the tape. Sorry... We can start now. Didn't you forget something? My sneakers were just ripped off. That's low. Disgusting. Sordid! - What can I do? - For my sneakers? Nothing. Nothing? Thinking of giving me your shoes? I'll stick to my own socks. Whatever, kid... As you like. My name's Antoine. Bye, Antoine. Darn, the temp girl! I forgot about that girl. Send her to Accounting. Nadine will brief her. And her office tour? I'm really too busy. I don't know... Ask Graham. Can he handle it? Meeting room... Green sofas and table. Meeting room... Blue sofas and table. And a TV. Meeting room... Purple sofas and table. Development... A blue computer. A red one. 4 chairs, 2 white trash cans. Creation... 2 lamps, 2 chairs... White trash cans... No computer. That's it. The roof! Excuse me... Can you help me? My hands are naturally cold. Try anyway. I can't. Too bad. Sorry. - Wrong size, silly me. - No problem. It's already forgotten. You've got a call. Let's go on. This way... This is the roof! Repeating everything? I'll play the scene again. That would help. OK, but backwards. That should be proposed to me more often. Do you have a tissue, please? No, but I saw some recently. One's left, way up inside. I put my hand too far up. Beware of its sharp teeth! The infirmary! Sorry! Emergency! Emergency! Sorry, I'm Miss Catastrophe today. - What's your name? - Graham. - I'm Irene. - My pleasure. Sorry, I didn't know... Should we have a bite at the canteen? I don't recommend it. It's not so great. Quite often disgusting. The coffee is foul... North American. I only have an apple for lunch. Then what about my place tonight? - Am I too fast? - No. Can you remind me at the end of the day? - If you want me to. - Yes. The address... On the board! If not, I'll be covered in messages by the end of the day. Fish or meat? - For me? - Yes. Keep it simple. I'll bring the wine. - Red or white? - I prefer red. Red... The remains of the last guy who made a mistake with the wine. Was that recently? 3 to 3-1/2 million years ago! It's a real bone. I'm into history and primate ecology... You know what paleontology is? Yes. Take a look at it. It must be fascinating. I'd have trouble following along. I live day by day. Even hour by hour. Is your posture always so straight? Does it bother you? I'd like to test your straightness... I'll do things you'll never forget. Almost time for work! Where? To work. But where? To work. You'll wake up at Irene's. Was that done last night? - It wasn't there yesterday. - I didn't notice. - What's so important? - It's a landmark. You know what it means? - Probably "Down with Work". - That's so passe. What, then? It must mean something. At work, forget that you know me. But I try so hard not to. - So hard? - It's difficult for me. - Act like nothing happened. - If you say so. I don't want to hurt you. Coffee? As usual! Just checking. Things change. You usually arrive that way. And you're later than usual. No sugar. Sugar can make coffee taste bitter, especially when we forget about it. Is it ready? Always ready. Good boy! I'll give you more... Recto, verso. Minuto! You have nothing to do. I do! For who? I'll explain that my stuff is urgent. You're looking at him! - It's me! - You! Come back in 15 minutes. I'll get screwed. You won't remember later. Write it on the board. Whatever you say... But I'll wait anyway. Tonight? No one for photocopies? Today is Tuesday... He's at the clinic. Clinic? Didn't you notice anything? Hello, Pablo. You're mistaken. My name is Graham, Dr. Sagem. Good boy, Graham. - How are you? - Fine. What now? So... we'll begin now. So I must go. You have another meeting in 10 minutes. OK? Do you know this man? We live in the same building. - What's his floor? - I don't know. But we waited together one evening for that damned broken-down elevator. - Did you speak? - No. Pity. You could have spoken to the world's richest man. It's Bill Gates. That wasn't him. Or him in the future. Broke and living in the suburbs, right? The same... with pie in face. And this man? So? What did they say? No improvement. They wanted you to see him? And what good does that do? What's the use? And this woman? Don't know her. Good to hear. She's my wife. And this one? I don't know her. - The sister? - Do they look alike? Not at all. Should I know her? Yes. - I'm hopeless. - No. And what's that? The fall of the Berlin Wall, 1989. See, you're not hopeless. Do you recognize this house? The Wall caretaker's house? And this woman? Still no. - Great. - No! Sure! You remembered seeing her photo before. And that house... It's yours. But I don't live there. Are we done? Yes. You can go home now. - Are you ready? - Ready? Ready. - Always ready. - It's me, Fred. - Are you coming? - Yeah. Not like that. OK. Ready... You have to bow. No, no... First to the Dojo. Try again? Grab the fist... Who are you? Let's start again. I'll remember everything for two. Don't look at what I drew. Promise? Even when you're peeing. Don't look! Does the light bother you? The light, no. The time, yes. Hurry! My make-up's done! And so is yours. Tell me, what did we do last night? Yes. - First I... - I can't hear. Louder. I oiled your organ with aloe cream. What did you do before? Any profession you hate? Imagine if I was a calculations teacher. Doesn't exist. A mental calculator. Try me. At least 3 digits. 347 times 347. 121,649. More complicated. 4 digits. 4092 times 6549. 27,837,968. Actually, you could say anything. I can't check it in my head. But it's true. 7685... times 7639. Minus the square root of 7639. - Distracted? - Not by my memory. What's that? It's like a stage light. A little light left on after the performance. Just count with your eyes closed. Well? We didn't count stops. We missed ours! We'll miss work again today. Graham came on Irene's stomach. That made both of them laugh a lot. Graham said he would get a towel. Irene refused. She wanted lo keep it on her. Until it changed from warm lo cold... from sticky to dry. Irene turned over. She's now lying on her stomach. Graham walks around the room, noting all its details. Irene tells Graham she's happy to have met him. Very happy, she adds. Things change after the second time. I mean the second night. Really? Well, yes. We pay attention to what we say. We dream about other things. You think so? Yes. Sweet things, peaceful things. At the same time, things start to get a little scary. Not scary, but... This fear of disappointing the other. I'd like us to be intimate. What's intimacy to you? Can you tell me a childhood memory? That's intimate, isn't it? Childhood... Excuse me... Did we come yet? Don't move! Stay! Put this around you. Have we been in this car before? Do you know him? Kids... So easy to clown around. Got a hard-on? A piece from my past. Don't hold it against me. You have pieces, too. I was hesitant about coming by. Have a seat. I'm very worried. I have no news of Pablo. Pablo? Oh, yes... He's never at home. He doesn't answer the phone. I hope he isn't sick... He's doing well. His work is improving. We're all very happy with him. He's had no problem integrating. I'm dying to see him. I understand. But this is his workplace and it must remain that way. He won't recognize me. That might change. I hope so for you. Even if that means we'll lose him. What good would it do seeing him now? But I'm his wife. I'll show you the way. He recognized me. - He doesn't want to see me... - He didn't see us. He's quite unpredictable, you know. We could speak more privately of him. How so? Give me your phone number. Well, I'm moving closer... Now I see him better. He's very meticulous. He checks all copies. He does a lot. Everything's just fine. Hey you, bring this urgent copy to Accounting! Thanks. Apparently, this is urgent. I'm afraid it might be too late. I'm sorry I have lo admit... It's unpleasant, very unpleasant... when you don't recognize me. But it's very, very pleasant when you fuck without past. Without routine. Each time is the first time. I need lo feel attached, to love what you love. To know what books you love, to read them and love them, too. I'm selfish. Love makes one selfish for two. I'm in Love with Irene Who Sleeps Next to Me Shit! The alarm didn't go off! Irene, we're late! We're late! Get up, Irene! It's 9:30. 230! It's Saturday. Saturday? That bitch! She makes you come on Saturday! Sorry. If you fucked others... would you remember? You'd note it. At least you'd write it down in your notebook? No, you wouldn't. If you did, then I'd know. You're a bastard, Graham. No. How can I trust you? I'm becoming a pain... Let's forget it. Should I do your butt? My butt? Really? We can't do this all weekend. Why not? No traces. Nothing. No traces. And you? What's left for you from all that? Fleeting impressions that are forgotten so as to remain in the present. Like forgetting so as to remain faithful. Let's test her abilities. Give her a heavy task. - You calculate very poorly. - I'm a little tired today. It's Monday! And by Friday? The mistakes are on small sums. Each and every detail is important in this department. I can't keep you on. Give me a chance. Tomorrow... I can't keep you on. It's a matter of trust. A pity. You're so energetic. I told the agency how you reduced our backlog. Should I thank you? They're ready to assign you another job. The main exit is the other way. It's a GPS. Global Positioning System. You'll be able to find me within one centimeter. Let's try. - What is it, Graham? - I'm Pablo. It's not right what you did to Irene. You intruded on her personal life. Company life was at jeopardy. I was simply judging her work. She helps me. My condition improves with her. In fact, I'm almost healed. This is my last day here. I quit as of tonight. See, I did it! No more Graham. I'm here with an old friend. Hey, you. I came by to see how it's going. See. It's coming. What? It comes. It goes. What goes? My memory. It's coming back. You've been skipping practice, you know. I'm perfectly aware of that. Come up a moment. Graham had a visitor. - I know he did. - I don't know... Maybe his friend Fred. Where is he? - Where? - He just left. Are you Irene? For Graham! Get on. Run along, honey. We're all very thankful. If you can help Pablo, all the better... Yes, Antoine? - What do I bring? - Everything. Fred is very supportive. He came with me to the clinic... You're a sweetheart. Could you bring us some ice, too? Pablo will regain his place as husband. Regain his place as father... As Fred's best friend. Go back and listen! When Pablo regains his memory... Now you know everything. Next time you see him... These are recent photos of us. I'm glad you came by. Pablo is living in limbo. Innocent... without fault... without sin. When he recovers, he'll realize we played like him. Do you want to? Now? - Antoine. - Thanks, Antoine. It's the wind... I hate to say this, Graham... But you're just not lovable at this time. No one can fall in love with you. Not me, not anyone. Being in love is about having a history. You're not capable of creating one. I can't make one for both of us. I can't do it alone. Close your eyes. The jukebox is busted. What should I have played for you? What would you have played for me? I'm sorry for what I did. It was low. Ridiculous. I hate myself for having done it. There you have it. I came to apologize. I don't know what came over me. Since last night... I have this rage deep inside. That's not like me at all. I don't like it at all. You're right to start your life over. Waiting for me is useless. It's a stupid idea. I don't know you... even if we are married. That's why this rage... I don't want it. A guy like me can't be betrayed. I assure you. Don't feel guilty. There's no betrayal, no wrong of any kind. There's no harm. I'm no longer here. Start your life over. I think that's a healthy attitude. I'm happy for you. And I'm not being cynical. I saw you earlier. You're pretty. That dress looks nice on you. I talk a lot, don't I? But it's also your fault for not saying anything. We might decide not to see each other anymore. It's for the best. Especially not looking each other up. Don't worry. Others will tend to me. People love helping the sick. The only thing to do is forget me. You have to forget me. I think everyone should just forget me. Sir! Someone forgot this. Go away! Go away! She's strong. No... She's not strong. Why do you want her to be strong? I swear she's really strong. You aren't going to drop me, are you? Bastard! Isabelle said it was over between them. I can't help you anymore. I did a lot by stealing his notebook. And I don't have anything against her. - She's really strong. - Stop saying that! Stop it! Tell me again how it happened. When did it happen? Then I'll leave you alone. I promise. - Let's have a drink. - Sorry, I don't have time. Five minutes... - You're dumping me? - Yeah. Isabelle's waiting... and I don't drink with losers. You didn't win by much! I meant winning Isabelle. You're an asshole. I should have used the forbidden hold. - You're crazy! - It's true. I discovered it in a Chinese book. And what's so special about that hold? According to the Chinese, it can send adversaries far, far away. And they never return. I've had it with your making fun of me! This is the story of a tooth knocked out during a boxing match. It was recovered by a fan who then gave it to her son. He exchanged it lo a friend for a porno magazine. It's the story of a tooth which decided to start its life over. What are you doing here? Where is he? I want him to see me. Come in. No, he has to come to me. - He's not here, I swear. - Where is he? I don't know. - Where is he? - Don't shout. What good is shouting? Come inside. I won't move from here until he sees me. Hold on... Wait! We can track him if he hasn't shut down. Where did you come from? Now or originally? Now... The bus stop. Yes, but before? I don't know. Far away. Does your mother live around here? No. So what are you doing here? Why? Is it forbidden? One doesn't come here for fun. Can't we have fun here? What are you doing? I don't know... Just looking. What did you put inside me? Don't worry. I'll take it back. - Have you two finished? - He's sleeping. - So you finished. - We didn't even start. What a face! I can't believe it. A baby. Like a baby sleeping. Let him sleep. Come on... Have you been waiting 10 minutes? Are you kidding? One hour. - It's been an hour. - One hour! That's great! One of you is called Julie. Am I right? Come back! I forgot the tooth. 38... 19, VZ, 29... Kid! My kid! Antoine! It's been so long. I never stopped seeing you. I followed you everywhere. Really? On the subway, the train... At the clinic and even at Irene's. Were you ashamed of me? What I mean is, did you have reason to be? Not at all... For an adult, you were great. You were completely novo. Novo? I have the impression it's all coming back to me. Before you arrived, I remembered a saying from some philosopher. His name is on the tip of my tongue. It mentions 4 positive negations. "Nothing protects us from what can happen." "Never admire the powerful." I forgot the third one. And "Don't humiliate the pitiful". I think you told me that before. Many times? Hundreds. Are you mad at me because of Irene? Mom's not mad. Should we stay like this all night? Do you sleep with boys often? Listen... I don't think so. I think it's the first time. It's my first time, too. So we'll remember it all our lives. Isn't that what first times are all about? I hope so. Aren't you cold? Sure, but I don't want to think about it. I like this night. I wish it would never end, but... Dawn is coming. It will touch our heads first. Have you ever been in love? Not yet. I'm hard to please. Everything fine at school? High school next year? No. I have to repeat this year. Repeat it? I can't allow you to leave. Do you understand? If the license plate matches... If what you say is true... we'll do what's necessary about the tooth. I have my memory back. Not everything, but a part of it. - You said that last week. - I remember! Maybe. That must be verified. Agreed, Pablo? My name is Graham. Good boy! That's what I thought. I'm a little cold. Could you pass me that blanket behind you? Certainly. I'm still cold. I'll be less cold standing. I'm still cold. I need to walk a little. I need to walk a little. Let's go! Could you put it on top? I'll carry them to your car. Not here... Do you want to come over? In case I forget, where do you live? Follow me. What did you forget now? It doesn't matter. We all forget things. Love is about forgetting time, yet remembering it can end at any time. It's a three-way love... Graham, Pablo and me. Whether it's 2 or 3 in love... we have lo handle becoming childlike together.
