Where's my pencil box? I've gotta have my pencil box! I shouldn't be down here. Not without my pencil box. I'm allowed my pencils. Pencils is a privilege, Wutz. This is D-Block. There ain't no priveleges on D-Block. But I'm allowed my pencils, even the warden says so. It's in my file, improved temperament. That's what it says right there in my file. Your temperament's so good what you doing down on D-Block? I just cut someone a little that's all. Just a little nick. The Warden gives out privileges, Wutz. And I take 'em away. No fucking pencils. Enjoy your time in solitary, Wutz. I'm gonna cut your heart out fucking and eat it! Where's my pencil box? I gotta have my pencil box! I gotta have it, it's mine! Give me back my pencil... Give me back my pencil box! Give me back my pencil box... Sweet Jesus! We got his pencil box here? This what you want? Oh, yes sir, that's my pencil box. Pity you didn't care so much for that broad you sliced up in Iowa. I gotta have my pencils. I give you this box you gonna shut the fuck up? Oh yes sir, you won't hear from me anymore. It'll all be over once I get my pencil box. So, what you gonna draw? Blood. What? Holy shit! Gerry, hit the bell! [ALARM BELL SOUNDS] What's this? That's my letter of introduction, sir. As you can see, it's signed by John J. Brennan, who was undersecretary to Mayor Rossi... I know who John Brennan is, son. I was on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors when we forced him to step down. To this day I'm sorry those corruption charges didn't stick. Charles Schmidt is an exceptional young man, and I would consider it a person favour if he could be considered for a role in the prison service, suitable for a young man of his education, background and standing in the community. So what exactly is a young man of your education, background and standing in the community doing here on Alcatraz? Well, to be completely honest sir, my father thought it was high time I got myself a respectable job rather than live off his money. Is that so? And how do you feel about that? Not completely thrilled, sir. I'll bet. Well, Mr Schmidt, I'm sure somebody with your connections would be welcomed into just about any institution in the State of California with open arms... But that's not how it works here on Alcatraz. This above all - to thy own self be true. Do you know who wrote that, Mr Schmidt? William Shakespeare, sir. I believe it's from Hamlet. Yes. Quite right. Well the way I see it, nepotism is just another form of corruption. And if there's one mission I have in this life it's to stamp out corruption wherever I find it. That's what led me to the office in which you now stand. The office of the Warden of the Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary. Are you aware of some of the no-good scoundrels we've played host to on this island? Al Capone? Machine Gun Kelly? Dangerous people, people connected to the mob at all levels. It's all I can do to try and ensure the inmates aren't killing each other and that our employees aren't taking pay-offs to look the other way. You wouldn't believe the things a man will do for a few dollars. Ah - If I may say something, sir? What? Well, given my family background and all, I really don't need to take pay-offs. Hmm, right, I suppose you've got a generous trust fund waiting for you? Not if I don't get a job, sir. You might say I'm uniquely motivated on that front. Why's that? Well my father did set up a trust fund for me, but a specific condition for the fund to be released is that I receive a positive employment reference from a respected institution such as this one. So you're really serious about needing a job? Cos I don't want to waste my time on some rich kid who's just here for a vacation. Completely serious, sir. All right. Well listen, son, there's just two types of men we can use here on Alcatraz... Tough sons of bitches to keep the prisoners in line and pain-in-the-ass pen-pushers to do the same for the paperwork. And you look to me like you might just make a proficient pen-pusher. Thank you, sir. That's not a compliment, Schmidt. Now it just so happens we are down one clerk on D-Block. What would that involve, sir? Oh, logging prisoners in and out, filling out reports. Can you use a typing machine? Never tried, sir. Well, it's on the night shift so I imagine it'd be pretty quiet down there. I'm sure an educated young man like you can find ways to fill your time. Sounds perfect, sir. I'd like to start right away. All right. There's a plan of the island on a board outside this office. Accommodation Block is next to the Infirmary. Cell Blocks are beyond that. Get yourself over to Accommodation, make yourself known to Mr Willis, he'll issue you with a room and a uniform. Report to the Cell Block at 6pm, somebody'll show you to D-Block. And don't be late. I run a tight ship here, Mr Schmidt. I'll try not to let you down, sir. And... let's keep this to ourselves. As Shakespeare himself might have put it - nobody like a tourist, Mr Schmidt. [BELL RINGS] Do you know where I can find D-Block? Uh - I'm looking for D-Block? Well I guess you found it. I'm Charlie Schmidt. The new clerk. Oh, you're Arnold's replacement. We was just talking about Arnold. Funny how he disappeared. I'm Al Bradbury. This is Gerry Rebane. Don't mind him - he don't talk much. Come on, I'll show you where you'll be working. So, who exactly is in charge down here? Can you read and write? Yeah. Then I guess it's you. I wouldn't go sticking my head into that one if I were you. What? Why? This way. A little small, isn't it? What did you expect, the penthouse suite? You got your desk. You got your desk light. You got your telephone. You got your typing machine. Hey, you know how to use that thing? I'm sure I can figure it out. The Warden says I gets pretty quiet down here? Well now, that depends on what you mean by quiet. You see, D-Block is a punishment block. Solitary confinement. We get the worst of the worst down here. Some nights, when there's a big fight upstairs or in the rec yard, we can get eight or ten roughnecks down here packing out the cells to do their punishment in solitary. Screaming and hollering all night. And other times, when everybody's on their best behaviour... It's quiet? Sometimes the quiet nights - they're the worst. What do you mean? Let me tell you a little bit about D-Block. It was built on the foundations of the original cells they used as a military prison back in the civil war days. And they say that for hundreds of years before then, the Indians were coming out here to the island to abandon their evil-doers, leave 'em to starve. So you see, there's a lot of lost souls on Alcatraz. And they say, some of them have taken to walking the halls of D-Block at night. And when it's quiet, well, that's when you can hear 'em. [BELL RINGS] Sounds like we got our first customer of the night. You'd better come watch this. You're gonna regret this. So you're Billy 'The Rat' Rattner? Make a note of that, Charlie. Every prisoner's got to be logged on and off the block. What is it with you? What do you screws know about anything? Well I do know one thing. All your mob connections ain't gonna help you down here. Just you wait 'till I get out of here. All of yous. You're gonna be sorry. Who says you're ever getting out? That's very funny. You know, I got a lot of friends on the outside. From what I hear, your friends ain't so friendly no more. What do you mean? Hey! Enjoy your time in solitary, Billy. Wait! Listen, please! Okay... B - I - L - L - Y Space. Oh... Okay. B - I - L - L Hello? Good evening, Operator. Um, can I get a line out to the mainland from here? Uhuh? Got it. Thanks. Hello? Oh, hi Jackson. It's - ah - it's Charlie here. Is my dad there? Oh, I see. Er... No, no-no-no, don't - don't drag him away from a party. I just wanted to - to call and let him know that er... I got accepted on the staff at Alcatraz, just like he wanted. Yeah, yeah it is... um... it is a high position. I've even got my own office. Uhuh. Yeah. I expect he will be proud. So if you could just let him know that I called? Okay, er, thank you. You have a good evening too, Jackson. Aagh... come on Charlie, snap out of it! Hello, Operator? Um, can I get a line to A-Block please? Ah, the clerk's office. What's up? Just checking something. Hey, Al? What's eatin' ya? I wanted to ask you something. I was looking over some of the records from last month. Well, that would've been Arnold's work. The last clerk. He and I didn't see eye to eye on a lot of things. Well, look, I thought I could fill out some of the missing sections using the records I borrowed from A-Block. You what? I asked the clerk on A-Block if I could borrow the records of the inmates that got sent down to solitary, and I have to say, they don't match with our records at all. I mean, look here... Samuel Fisher got sent down to cell 13 overnight, and according to the records on A-Block he was in his usual cell upstairs. Well, sometimes people get sent down here to solitary, kind of unofficially. Unofficially? It's a punishment block, solitary confinement. A person breaks a rule, they get sent down. Right. Sometimes, somebody breaks an unwritten rule. An unwritten rule? There's a ton of 'em in a place like this. You sit in the wrong guy's chair in the lunch hall, you piss the wrong guy off in the rec yard, a person needs to punished. Kind of... off the books. You know? Anyway, Arnold - he just didn't get it. Seems like he was try to log records for the unofficial ones. There's no need to do that. The way I see it is, why make more work for yourself? Uhuh. You ain't got a problem with that, have you? I don't know. I really need to keep this job. I hear the Warden's a real stickler for paperwork. I got all the paperwork you need right here, boy. [ELECTRICAL BUZZING] What's going on? Hey, wait, what? Ah - this is - this is not right! Rattner, what is it? No! Aaagh! Rattner? Charlie! Sun's coming up. There's only a couple of hours left on your shift. Why don't you go outside and get some air? Yeah. Yeah, I guess I'll do that. Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry, I was rushing. No, I wasn't watching where I was going. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah I'm fine, just uh... Just coming off my first night shift. Feeling kind of rough. Oh, I started out on nights too. It's tough. I'm on the early shift now. In the infirmary. Right. Yeah - haven't visited there yet. Well let's hope you won't need to! I'm Sherry. Sherry Vallens. Charlie Schmidt. Glad to meet you. You know I can't say I've seen many friendly faces since I've been on the island. Well people don't come to Alcatraz for the laughs! What is it you do? Something real important I bet. Ah, you know... They needed someone tough, you know, on A-Block, to keep everyone in line. We've got over a hundred men up there you know? [ALARM RINGS] I wonder what that is? I guess you'd better go. Yeah... yeah. Can't manage without me, I guess. If you ever get sick, you know where to find me! The Infirmary! Right! [ALARM RINGS LOUDER] What is that? Oh shit. You must be cursed kid. First day on the job and you get to fill out a death report. What do you think happened? Suicide kid. Happens all the time. The dark makes 'em crazy. Hey, Al - what happens next with this report? I'll take care of it. It's good to speak with you again, Commissioner. Yes, I understand the process. No, of course not, I wouldn't dream of asking you to break any confidences. Yes, I'd absolutely be ready to take on the post, should it - ah - should the decision go in my favour. Well, as you know, my tenure here on The Rock has been rather successful in terms of... Well, exactly! No, I don't envision anything changing in the near future. There are no skeletons in the closet here I can assure you. Well, that's good to know. Thank you, Commissioner. Yes, it would sure be nice to be off of this island. My wife's been giving me hell about it for the past six years. No, I won't. Good day. [DOOR KNOCKS] You may enter. Would you care to explain this? Ah, I'm not sure what... Unexplained? Seventeen death reports have passed over my desk since I became Warden. I'm not proud of the fact, but from time to time we lose a man, either due to violence or sickness or plain old age, but I have never seen one of these filled out with the cause of death listed as Unexplained. It's a loose end and I don't like it. Well, sir, I... So I had one of the old docs on the infirmary take a look at Billy Rattner's body. He determined the cause of death to be asphyxiation - do you concur? Well, yes, it did look like that but I don't... This is exactly what I was afraid of. College kids. One night on the job and you think you know better than everybody else. Let me tell you something, Mr Schmidt. Asphyxiation is the single most common form of suicide in the entire penal system. Men take a belt, a bed sheet, anything they can get their hands on... But that's exactly it, sir, I... Don't interrupt me! Mr Bradbury reported that he recovered a belt from the cell at the time the body was discovered. With respect, sir, I didn't see any belt. Did you even think to look for a belt? No sir. All the college degrees in the world can't compare with a few years solid experience in the penal system, Schmidt. You didn't see a belt because you didn't think to look for it. Perhaps you'd like to tell me what you think happened? Well, after I heard the alarm, I came back onto the block... Wait a minute - you came back onto the block? From where? I just went out to get some air. For how long? Well, just for a moment, sir. You can check with er... Sherry Vallens, she's a nurse on the Infirmary. So, you were away from your desk, fraternising with nurses, while a prisoner on your block died under your watch? Well I - I wouldn't put it like that, exactly... Listen, Schmidt. I made it very clear that I run a tight ship here, but I guess it didn't sink in. So let me make it clearer. I don't care whose nephew you are, what college you went to or who your daddy paid off to get you here, I will not hesitate to ship you straight back to San Francisco with your tail between your legs if you don't shape up. And you can forget about getting that employment reference. Yes sir. Was there something else? Well, sir, I'd like to talk to you about corruption. What? Ah - I think there is a culture of corruption and pay-offs on D-Block. Pay-offs? I was presented with this handful of dollar bills by Al Bradbury, sir. Mr Schmidt, have you ever held down a regular job before? No sir. Then you can be forgiven for not understanding workplace culture. You just arrived on the block! Mr Bradbury and the other men probably just took up a little collection to welcome you on board. I really don't think that was the intention, sir. Nonsense. I'm quite sure it's an old tradition on the cell block. So if I was to recommend an investigation... You are not to recommend any such thing, now is not the time Mr Schmidt. But sir, you even said... There are more things in heaven and earth, Mr Schmidt... Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. You did go to college, didn't you? Smart kid. Keep on being smart and maybe you'll get somewhere. You just keep your suspicions to yourself. Thus conscience does make cowards of us all. What was that? Just a little Shakespeare, sir. Is Jimmy there? Yeah, this is Al. From The Rock. Yeah, that Al. You tell Jimmy that Billy 'The Rat' Rattner ain't gonna rat on nobody no more. Just like he wanted. No - no trouble. Well, just the new clerk. He got a bit out of line, but we're gonna teach him a lesson. Looks like it's going to be a quiet one tonight. Look out for lost souls. Wait a second, what is it with that cell, the one where Billy Rattner died? You warned me not to stick my head in there. Mm, cell 13. Come on, let's talk in your office. Let me tell you about cell 13. It's got its own particular history. It was about five years ago. A hell of a night, even by Alcatraz standards. The waves were crashing and the rain was pouring. They brought in a guy by the name of Ed Wutz. Stone cold killer. Convicted murderer. And he stood there in cell 13, mild as you like, and asked for his pencil box. You know, a pencil box - like your kid takes to school? We didn't see no harm in it. So we gave it to him. You know what he did? He opened that pencil box and pulled out that pencil sharpener - and he drew it across his throat from ear to ear. And the blood poured out like a regular Niagara. You know the worst part of it? The part that really turned my stomach? He laughed. He laughed the whole fucking time he was dying. Guess he thought he had one over us. That death would be his way out of here. But I ain't so sure about that. What do you mean? What I mean is, you know what I was saying about lost souls? I reckon Ed Wutz was the most lost soul of all. I mean, I've met some evil people. People who'd rob and rape and murder their own mothers. But Ed Wutz was something else. That cell? I sometimes think he's still in there. Waiting. Waiting for a chance to kill again. So you think that Billy Rattner was murdered by Ed Wutz? I think Billy Rattner committed suicide, because that's what happened. I also think I don't wanna go anywhere near cell 13, just in case. There's one more thing. What's that? I think you accidentally mislaid this money in the office. Well, jeez... I appreciate that. Hello? Oh, hi Jackson, it's... ah... Charlie again. Yeah? Oh, I see. Ah... who's there for dinner? Oh, no - no - no, don't... don't interrupt them. Um... did he ask how I was getting along? Oh. Okay. Um, well, if he asks, ah, can you please tell him that everything is um... It's just fine. Yeah. Thank you, thank you. You have a good evening too, Jackson. [TELEPHONE RINGS] Hello? Is that Charlie Schmidt? Yeah. It's Sherry. The nurse? We met this morning. Oh, right. Thank goodness I finally found you, I must have called every number on the cell block. Well, it just occurred to me that I never properly welcomed you to Alcatraz. Uhuh. You just started, right? Yeah. So - welcome to Alcatraz! There, I said it. Thanks. The strange thing is, this number is down in the directory as the clerk's office on D-Block but I thought you said you were in charge of A-Block? Ah... yeah, um... I-I-I really appreciate the call, ah... Sherry. Um, but I've really, really gotta go. All those hundreds of prisoners getting out of line? Right, right, yeah. Um... ah... look, I'll... I'll see you around. Goodnight, Charlie. Goodbye. I think Billy Rattner committed suicide. Because that's what happened. Where's my pencil box? Al? Cell 13. What is it with cell 13? [ELECTRICAL BUZZING] [ELECTRICAL BUZZING] Where's my pencil box? I gotta have it, it's mine. Shit. Shit! Hey, Al? Anybody? The light went out in the office. Charlie? What is it, are you sick? Come on, let's get you to the infirmary. Look, before you say anything - I do work in the clerk's office on D-Block. I'm not stupid, Charlie. Now come on, let's get that shirt off. Those ribs aren't gonna to fix themselves. Ow, somebody really worked you over! And you've no idea who did this? The ghost of Ed Wutz. What? No, nothing. No, I didn't see anybody. Now this may sting a little. A little? Sorry! You know, you should report this. I don't know. I've a feeling there are a few people around here who'd prefer I didn't. What do you mean? We had a death on the block. It happens. Suicide most often. Or somebody gets stabbed. We're always in here, sewing them back up. Sometimes I think they want to get stabbed, just to spend some time in the infirmary. Who could blame them? Anyway, I don't think this was suicide. Murder? I don't know maybe... Except he was in his cell alone the whole time. And when we found the body his hand was like, like this, wrapped around his throat. And when we took him out of his cell, it was stuck like that, like he was trying to strangle himself. You can't strangle yourself with your own hands. It can't be done. Even if you were crazy you'd pass out before you died. Well that's what I thought, but they made me fill out the report as a suicide. Who made you? Al Bradbury. Oh, I know him. I had to medicate him for... well, a social disease, about six months back. I hear he goes into town once a month or so and fools around with the wrong kind of women. Well it's not just him, it's the Warden too. When I first got here he made this huge speech about how he wanted to stamp out corruption. When I - when I wanted to bring it up, he was... Ow! What was that? Just a shot of morphine for the pain. Might make you a little dizzy for a while, you probably shouldn't work your shift tonight. Not a chance, I'm in enough trouble as it is. The Warden's really got it in for me. I wouldn't worry about it, I heard he's desperate to get off this island. Word is he's going after some high up job with the police - Internal Affairs, whatever that is. Anyway, I've got to get back to D-Block before the other guys get back so I can look around. You're pretty curious for a prison guard. Most of the guys that work on this island are just plain mean. They're only here because they like being able to push people around. Uhuh. Did you go to college? Uhuh. What did you study? Literature. Wow, you must be pretty smart. Mmm, I don't know. What is they say - book-smart? Maybe I'm that. So why are you here? Oh, it's a long story. I already laid it out to the Warden. But there's one thing I didn't tell him. What's that? Have you ever heard of a thing called Claustrophobia? Sure, people who are scared of tiny little places, right? Well that's me. You're kidding? Don't tell anybody that I told you. Been that way since I was a kid. Even hated being in the crib. So why would someone with claustrophobia go to work in a jail? My dad's idea of aversion therapy. He used to lock me in the coal store in the back of our house for hours when I was a kid, thinking if I was there long enough I'd snap out of it. Now I don't fit inside the coal store anymore he thought of this. His way of trying to toughen you up? I guess. That and me proving I can earn an honest living. It's not that unusual, my Uncle Frank did it to my cousin Michael, now he's sweating it out in the San Francisco PD trying to make Lieutenant, and they sure don't need the money. What about you? Huh? What brought you to Alcatraz? You're not mean. Nothing really, just saw a sign saying Nurses Wanted. I always used to nurse my mom before she died so it just seemed natural to make it official. Was she sick for long? Yeah. What was it? We never really knew. One summer she just kind of started wasting away. I'm sorry. Listen, Charlie - I know it's not really right for a girl to ask but... Well, every two weeks I get a weekend off and, well usually me and some of the girls, we get the boat back to 'Frisco, walk along Pier 39, eat ice-cream... Well I was wondering, if you had a day off and I had a day off, well if we both happened to have the same day off then... maybe you'd like to come and meet us up on the Pier? Charlie? [BELL RINGING] You got sore guts, Charlie? Must be that food they serve us up in the dorm. Ain't much better than the crap they give the cons. I'm okay. Hey, the light went out in the office last night. Must be the old generator playing up. Lights flicker, phones go down for a couple of minutes. Ain't nothing to worry your head about. Okay Oh, er, one other thing. What's that? Do we have a library here, or something? For the prisoners? Yeah, sure, there's one up on A-Block. But books ain't allowed down here. Why's that? Books is a privilege. There ain't no privileges on D-Block. And anyhow, there ain't no lights in the cells. Hey, the Warden just called down. He's still waiting on that report. Cell 13. Always cell 13. [TELEPHONE RINGS] Hello, Infirmary. Sherry, is that you? Charlie? Hey, how are you? I'm fine, ah - I wasn't sure if... if you'd be there? Oh, I switched to nights, same as you. How come? Ah - I don't know, just felt like a change I guess. What made you call? Ah - I don't know, just um... just really finding it hard to concentrate. Well I told you not to work tonight. I know. Ah, actually I wanted to ask you something. Do you have records of all the people who've died on the island? Well, yeah, they all have to pass through the Infirmary. They have to be confirmed dead by one of the physicians. So if I gave you a list, um, of names, could you check that against the list of people who died on the island? Sure! Not exactly my idea of fun, but why not? Great, I appreciate it. Thanks. Was there anything else you wanted to ask me? Ah... so I was thinking, ah... if you wanted to maybe meet up tomorrow? Before... before our shift? Yeah, that'd be nice. There's this spot down from the Infirmary where you can sit and look out over the bay. Ah... I was just thinking that I could give you that list. Oh - okay. But that - that'd be nice too, the view over the bay. It is. So I'll... I guess I'll see you tomorrow. 'Night, Charlie. Goodnight. Samuel Fisher, William B Clarence, Fred O'Neill. [ELECTRICAL BUZZING] Oh, not again. Where's my pencil box? Give me back my pencil box! Give me back my pencil box! It's my pencil box, not yours! [LAUGHTER] What was in that shot you gave me? Just morphine, why? Does it make you hallucinate? I don't think so. I had a hell of a time last night, thought I was going crazy. Well, I'm sorry. I was just trying to help. Well, may - maybe it wasn't the shot, maybe it was just - just the claustrophobia. You say you had hallucinations? I had something. What did you see? I don't know. Heard voices. Things moving around. Was it the ghost of Ed Wutz? What? I don't know. Something you said. Have you heard that before? No. Were you working here five years ago? No, why? I don't know - nothing, nothing. Probably just a story Al told me to scare me off. Sounds like it worked! What's the book? Just a copy of Hamlet, You know, Shakespeare? Yeah, I thought it'd be a good way to pass the time on the block but I haven't had chance to read it yet. What's it about? Ah - er, it's about a prince in Denmark, and his father the king dies - well, gets murdered, actually - and his love Ophelia drowns, and there's a big sword fight and everyone dies in the end. That sounds awful! No, no, no - it's great, it's really great. No, it's - it's the language, it's um... I read it in college but I never really got it until now. Read me some. You sure? Yeah, I wanna hear it. Okay. To the celestial and my soul's idol, the beautified Ophelia. Doubt thou the stars are fire, doubt thou the sun doth move, doubt truth be a liar, but never doubt that I love. Wow. You see, what happens is Hamlet's father the king gets murdered by his brother who takes over the kingdom, and Hamlet finds out what happened because his father's ghost comes back to warn him. So it's a ghost story? Kinda... And you chose to read that in the middle of the night on D-Block? No wonder you're seeing ghosts! I didn't see ghosts exactly! I don't know, it's just so dark and scary down there. I just sure wish you could spend the night with me. What? Oh! No, not that! No, erm, on the block - spend the night on the - on the - on the block. Er... Either way would be just fine with me, Charlie. [BELL RINGS] Oh shoot! It's six o'clock! Where are you going? I gotta get to D-Block! Um, I gotta run. This is your share... For helping ditch Billy The Rat. And, there's a little extra... for the beating you gave Charlie. What's with the flashlight, Charlie? That generator was playing up again last night. Didn't you guys notice from out here? No. The Warden's still waiting on that report. [TELEPHONE RINGS] Hello? Charlie, it's me. Is something wrong? Listen, there's something I've gotta tell you, it's about... [ELECTRICAL BUZZING] What was - what was that? Did you hear what I said? I saw... [ELECTRICAL BUZZING] Oh, come on! Is there something wrong with the line? The power keeps going out. What? I said, the power... never - never mind. Ah, meet me in the morning when you get off. I didn't get that - shall I meet you in the morning when I get off? Ye - yes, er, meet me outside the cell block after six. Got it. Right. Wait! Erm, what - what about the names? What? The - the list of names, did you check it? They're dead. They all died. Wha - what was that? They're all dead, Samuel Fisher, William Clarence, all of them. Please be careful, Charlie, I think... [DIAL TONE] Huh... Hello? Give me back my pencil box! I'm through with this, guys! You hear? I'm through! Is somebody there? Let me tell you about cell 13. It's got its own particular history. Hey! [LAUGHTER] Al? Is somebody there? Al, is that you? Come on, let me out! It's not funny! It's okay, Charlie. It's okay, Charlie. Just like the coal store, it's just like the coal store. Only this time you're not gonna piss yourself. It was about five years ago. They brought in a guy by the name of Ed Wutz. And that cell? I sometimes think he's still in there... ...waiting. Give me back my pencil box! [LAUGHS] He pulled out that pencil sharpener - and drew it across his throat from ear to ear. [LAUGHTER] You looking for someone? Charlie Schmidt. He sick or something? Ah... yeah, he missed an appointment with me over in the Infirmary. Well I don't know if he's sick, or just sick in the head. He must be crazy to miss an appointment with you. Why, I still remember the time when you applied that cream on me, real nice. You got a real delicate hand. I think about it all the time. Never mind. Hey, wait up! We was just playing with you. Of course we know where Charlie is. Come on, we'll take you to him. Nurses aren't allowed on the block. Aw, you come with us, you'll be all right. No thanks, I'll just catch him later. Oh, we insist. You two had better watch out, Charlie's onto you! That bookworm don't know shit. He's already spoken to the Warden. I bet he's up there right now telling him everything. I know where Charlie is right now, and if my guess is right, the only guy he's talking to is my good friend Ed Wutz. You see, we already disappeared one clerk off D-Block this year. Guy by the name of Arnold Miller. So if another clerk goes missing, it's gonna look kinda suspicious. But you? I bet you never even met the Warden, did you? You probably just answered an ad and came out here on the boat. Girls like you come and go all of the time. Hell, some of them quit and don't even leave a note. There was one nurse, she found out her old man was playing around while she was out here working. She just plain tossed herself into the ocean, got all mashed up on the rocks. Might happened you to... after we've finished with you. Well, we was wondering where you'd got to. How the hell did you go get yourself locked in there? You ought to carry a set of keys, Charlie. Sherry! Sherry! I have over a hundred men working on this island, Schmidt. Why do I so often find myself looking across this desk at you? I need to report a disappearance, sir, there's a nurse, and... Yes, Mr Schmidt, I know all about your friend Miss Vallens. You do? I have it on good authority that you've been spending time with this nurse when you were supposed to have been on duty. Not to mention a report from the telephone operator's office about the unusual number of calls between the Infirmary and D-Block over recent nights, which I can only presume were not official business. We do not encourage such fraternising, Mr Schmidt. Yes, but that's not what I want to talk about... I also have it on good authority that Miss Vallens took the boat back to San Francisco yesterday afternoon to go care for her mother, and she won't be returning. I'm sorry if that disappoints you, Mr Schmidt. Perhaps your undeniable charm has failed you on this occasion. Personally, I can't say I blame her, I've had about as much of your company as I can stand for one week. Now get out, your shift started five minutes ago. But sir, that can't be right, Sherry's mother died years ago. I believe I've made myself clear. What about all the deaths on D-Block? I made a list of all the undocumented detainees and Sherry said... I don't want to hear it, Schmidt - I told you now is not the time. So you're happy to preside over corruption - even murder - as long as you don't miss out on your Internal Affairs job? As Shakespeare himself put it, there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so. Meaning what? Meaning that if a few more low-lifes meet their demise down on D-Block then maybe the world'll be a better place for it. Did you ever consider that? Do you think the world would be a better place without Sherry Vallens? Mr Schmidt, I'm warning you, you're going to stop these baseless accusations right now. Unless you're reconsidering your status as an ongoing employee of this facility? Well sir... maybe I am. I'll see to it that you never work in this State again. And you can just forget about ever getting your hands on that trust fund. You still need that employment reference, remember? Well sir, as Shakespeare himself might have said... Yes? Fuck it. Where's Sherry? What happened to her? Who are you talking about? I know what you're up to, Bradbury. I know all about the inmates you've murdered. Take it easy. You mean your nurse friend? I know what happened to her. Why don't you tell me? I'll do better than that - I'll show you. What are we doing here? You wanted to know what happened to Sherry? Well I'm showing you. She went out around the exercise yard, she came down between the stores and the Infirmary and she ended up in here. And this is where we caught up with her. And where is she now? I guess she's feeding sharks out in the bay - where you're gonna be joining her. I hate to do this to you, kid, but there's too much at stake. You see, I got me a little nest egg growing. And some day it's gonna be big enough that I can get off this God-forsaken rock for good. But until then I gotta keep growing it, and that means I gotta keep doing favours for my friends on the outside. So when I get the order than somebody has to disappear... into cell 13 they go. It's a pity you had to be the curious type - asking questions, filing reports. You know what they say about curiosity. You shoot that thing and someone will hear. There're over a hundred men on this island - some of them have got to be honest. You may be right. Gerry. I never killed a single con on this island. All I do is put them in that cell and mind my business. You're the first guy I ever saw come out of there alive! Must be cos you're so shit-scared you keeled over and passed out before anything happened! Charlie! Charlie? Charlie! Charlie, let me out! God damn it! Fuck! Enjoy your time in solitary, Al! All I do is put them in that cell and mind my business. Where's my pencil box? Get back! Get away from me! I gotta have my pencil box! [LAUGHTER] [BELL RINGING] Good morning Jackson, how are you? I'm sorry, I didn't realise it was... it was that early. Erm, is my dad there? Oh really? Ah - who else is there? Oh, could you please put Uncle Frank on? Yeah, yeah it's really important. Uncle Frank! How are you, how've you been? So according your report, Al Bradbury took his own life, just like Billy Rattner? So it would seem, sir. I believe he was adversely affected by a social ailment. I believe it may have affected his state of mind. Hmm, that certainly ties in with his record at the Infirmary. Well Mr Schmidt, I have to say, this is the kind of report I can get behind. Nothing left unexplained. I thought you might appreciate the lack of loose ends, sir. Certainly do. I'd hate for there to be any kind of corruption scandal on Alcatraz during my watch. So I understood, sir. There's nothing of that kind in my report. That's much appreciated. Though I did find that cell 13 looks structurally unfit for habitation, and I recommend it being permanently closed off. Recommendation duly noted. You've done Alcatraz a great service here, Mr Schmidt. The only question remaining is what can Alcatraz do for you? Naturally I've already written to your father with an unequivocally positive employment reference. You have? Went out on the boat with the rest of this morning's mail. Now, as to the future, we will need to completely re-staff D-Block. Perhaps you'd like to be in charge of that process? With an appropriate increase in salary of course. It may just be my last act as Warden of Alcatraz before I move on. Are congratulations in order, sir? Well the official announcement hasn't been made, but privately Commissioner Warren has assured me it's as good as done. I'm expecting his call any time now. Head of Internal Affairs - has a nice ring to it, doesn't it? One man in his time plays many parts. And all the world's a stage. Well, I appreciate the offer, sir. But I'm a little concerned that to the untrained eye this sudden promotion may look like some kind of... pay-off. And as I said once before, I don't need to take pay-offs. Especially now you've kindly sent that reference to my father. If you'll excuse me, I think I've served my time here on Alcatraz. Think you're pretty smart, don't you Schmidt? Not exceptionally sir, but I am well connected. And as I said to my Uncle on the telephone this morning, family connections can be very useful. I told you before, I'm not impressed by your connection to John J Brennan, the man's a scoundrel. Oh, I'm not talking about Brennan. No, he's just an old friend of my dad's. I was referring to my uncle from my mother's side - Uncle Frank. Or you might know him as Frank Warren - Commissioner Warren, of the San Francisco Police Department. We had a long conversation on the telephone this morning. He's very interested in the penal service, as you can imagine. He had a lot of questions I was able to help him with. I'm sure you will be receiving that telephone call from him real soon. Oh, by the way, I forgot to return this copy of Hamlet to the prison library. To thine own self be true. [TELEPHONE RINGS]
