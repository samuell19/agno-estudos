Darling, Glafira Petrovna. On this happy day of the anniversary of our marriage, on this memorable, highly exalted day, I, your loving husband, with all the strength of my soul with all of my heart... Get my fur! In French: Hello, Sir May I help you? Are you looking for someone? Pardon. Wait! [Today, at nine o'clock on the Kryukov, on the corner of Sretensky, on the second floor, to the right of the staircase. Be there without fail, for heaven's sake. - Go on! - GO! It is destined to end. Stop it. Stop it. Whoa! Stand. Dear sir, allow me to ask you. Do not pay any attention to me, like a face in the general sense, hearken, as a human being. Before you, sir, is a person with a humble request. If I can. What's it that you want? Well, don't think that I'm asking for money. Pardon me. I understand that I must seem anxious and strange to you. I see that I am a burden to you, but I'm sorry. Sorry. But permit me... to ask you frankly, did you not see a young lady around here? This is, in fact, my whole request. - Lady? - Yes, a lady. I saw one, but, I confess, here so many have passed that I did not... That's not what I wanted to say. I wanted to ask, whether you've seen a young mistress... You don't need her name, young man. A young lady with a fox cloak, a velvet bonnet and a veil. - No, I didn't see her. - Well, well, sorry. No, I definitely see that I am a burden to you. Consider that you see me in an upset state, almost madness, but please, do not disclose anything. Oh? To the point, to the point. No, I am resolutely out of my mind. Interesting, how do I seem to you in my humiliation? - But let me... - Speak openly. But do me a favor, for I still do not know what you want. - Well, speak. - I'll open up to you, My unknown friend. I will resolutely tell you everything. Well? Circumstances sometimes connect people with totally dissimilar characters. Well, Well, then, no nonsense, on. No nonsense? Have mercy on me, why the tone? No nonsense. Sorry, perhaps I have offended, calling you a young man, but I didn't mean anything. With one word. If you wish to do me the greatest service... Then well, a lady... I mean to say, a well-mannered woman, of a superb family of my acquaintances. And I have been instructed to... - I myself do not have a family. - Well, explain faster. Really, the tone of your words... I'm knocked down. I wholeheartedly confess, that I'm being knocked down. If you're a person of pride, then you've seen enough of my humiliation. Well, well, on. Eh? Well, well then, this lady, with noble behavior, an easy sensibility... Oh... I'm knocked down, really, now I'm talking about literature. What an idea, that Paul de Coq has an easy sensibility! But if you think about it seriously, the whole problem stems precisely from Paul de Coq, then, sir. Tell me straight, did she cheat on you? - Sir? - Killed. - Sir? Sir? - Now will be the blow. Sir? Sir? You've guessed it, betrayal. Though who doesn't have it happen to them. ŠOh, ÑC'est la vie. But you must agree, between two young people... Although I'm not a young person, it's a habit of bachelorhood, Between bachelors, do you know... Yes, yes, but how can I help you? I do not know where she ran off to, this lady. Well? But I do know that she is in this house. I am waiting for her, you see. I want to greet her. And explain how indecent it is, and how vile. Understand? But do not think that I'm doing this for me. No, this isn't my wife. This is someone else's wife. The husband is there, standing on the Voznesensky bridge. He wants to catch her, but hasn't decided. Like any husband, he still believes. An unfortunate man, I assure you. And I am his friend, as you can see, or I wouldn't be so distressed because of him, though, so to speak.. How many times have I told him: Why are you getting married to a young one, my dear friend? You have a title, you have wealth. An honorable man. What, all this abandoned at the whim of coquetry? No, family happiness! Here's family happiness for you. First he himself was others' wives, and now this. He drinks. The unfortunate man. Even drinks on his anniversary - this! - Pardon. - What? I do not have the honor of knowing you, I dare not pry into who you are and how, but in any case let us become acquainted. Very nice to meet you. I should have done this earlier, but I, you know, forgot my manners. But no, no, what do you mean. Do not excuse me, do not excuse me. In an upset mind, I forget myself, as I never have before. I ask you, well, yes, finally, what do you want? I'll explain. This lady, I'm catching her. I've been instructed... this is a sly young a lady... Paul de Coq is always under the pillow. I'm afraid that she'll somehow sneak out of here unnoticed... And I want to address you with a friendly request, excuse the liberty. But if you're walking around here anyway, then could you please walk somehow here... so to speak, to walk on this side of the street and on this lane here, with some sort of peace. That is, describing a the letter "P". I am going to keep watch from that corner. Once you notice her, stop and shout out to me. - What time is it? - Uh... Twenty... half past nine. And yet. I promise that I'll shout out to you. But I beg you, to give me space to leave. I too am waiting. Of course, of course, I'm leaving. You see, I understand the terrible impatience of a young heart. Young man, I understand the bachelor life! Calm! On you go. Calm! Calm! Understand? Excuse me. The devil take you, finally. Excuse me, young man, I'm again back to you. Give me your word, your honorable word, that you're not the lover. - Me? Let me be honest... - The Voznesensky bridge... Oh, I'm tripping over my words - All I want to say is that... - My dear sir. Of course. Of course. You are an honorable man, I am far from thinking that it's you. I don't want to think less of you. But you've promised me your word of honor and you would unburden me. OK, if you wish, I give you my word, I am a lover. But not of your wife. Someone else's wife, some.. someone else's wife on the Voznesensky bridge. Otherwise I would not be here now on the street, and would be with her. By the way, what time is it? But, oh well, I already asked you. That's it, go, do not waste your time. She could already have left a thousand times. My god, my god, well, yours is in the fox cloak and bonnet? And mine is in a plaid coat and velvet hat. - Well, what else do you want? - Oh. Oh. - Well, what else then? - Well then, a velvet hat? She has a velvet hat and a plaid coat. May the devil take you. Well, why are you looking at me like that? Because, young man, I knew it in your eyes. I guessed it. But no. No, the devil take you. Are you blind, or what? After all, I'm not with her, I'm here, standing in front of you. Well then, why are you not with her? Eh? Because I've been told to wait here after nine. - Oh I see... - I'll yet explain everything to him. - So step to it. - And where is she now? Yours...? Well, alright, she has an acquaintance here. - On the second floor. - Who? - What, should I call them by name? - Well, why then... - Well, General... - Polovitsin? No, it's not that general. Damn it, how do you know that it's Polovitsin, eh? Well? But whatever, I don't care whether you say it or not. As an honorable man, I will tell you everything. Yesterday I met his Excellency, the General Polovitsin. He says that it's already been three weeks since moved into a new apartment. And this wife, someone else's wife, that is on the Voznesensky bridge, she is a relative. This lady said that she was here three days ago. As a guest. At their house. Where is she going? Here's something for vodka, my dear. Who lives in the Polovitsins' apartment? Sofia Alsufevna, of course. Damn it. What kind of person is this Sofia Alsufevna? Come, come in, where it's warm. I've heard of this Sofia Alsufevna. A merry widow. She holds a Salon. Invites whomever she meets. Oh you, damn you. - Eh? - Yes, I'm afraid, I'm terrified. I would like to know, dear sir, what is the lady called? Well, the husband that is on the Voznesensky. - Ah, Gla... - Glafira? No, not Glafira, not Glafira, no. Well, of course not Glafira I know myself that it's not Glafira. Oh damn it... Damn it. Oh-oh-oh. My dear sir, where did you suddenly get the idea that her name is Glafira? Damn you, why are you bothering me. Well, that's enough, young man. I would not in your place, excuse me, damn an honorable man in misfortune every couple of minutes. Why? "Damn you, damn you". Yes yes yes, damn you, damn you! How funny. Please, more. I beg of you. Please. No no, only don't go home. I am absolutely not tired. Well, since you've come here to entertain me, if you please.. Oh! Serge, who are these people? - How funny. - Excuse me, excuse me. Cutie. Cutie. Not the one? This one's from there. My god. Knowing that she could be there... Well? What are you standing around for? You go up to the general. But he's moved. Well, go. I beg of you, go anyway. and pretend as if you don't know that he has moved. Go to him as if for his wife. And uncover whoever it is at Sofia Alsufevna's. Well, what's it to you whom I uncover? Shame on you. Miserable man, who cannot keep track of his wife. Someone else's wife! Someone else's wife, dear sir, you almost forget yourself. Well who cares, that I'm forgetting myself? Before whom do I forget myself? What is your surname? - Why do you need the surname? - Because the surname. - What is your surname? - I cannot say. - Believe me. - But why can't you say? Believe me, I deserve more courteous expressions. - Oh, oh, you deserve... - Quiet. Quiet. Mm-yes... My dear sir, if you are upset about something I can even guess about what, well, in any case, no need to forget yourself. You are still a very young man. Well, what's it to me, that you're old? Eka prodigy. Then step off, if you go there... unless you're a coward. That I'm old? What tone! That I'm old? By title, of course. But generally, I regret that I've trusted you with my secret, and you... Well, what did I do? What? - You're exploiting... - what? - My misfortune. You see, after all, that I'm upset. Again about himself. This is all just funny to me. What, do you think that every hurt husband is a fool? Hm, so are you the husband? - Eh? - It seems to me that you are the lover. - Well what's it to you? - Because you are a coward. - Me? - Yes. Why aren't you going up then? - Because I was told to wait here. - Ah, here... - Here. - From nine on and perhaps all night. - Oh that's how it is... - Yes. And you... And you are indeed a fool, if you are afraid to call your wife to order. - Who said to you that it's the wife? - You said it. - I am tripping over my words. - A-ha. But as a person who uses a certain degree of respect... - Fool. - I repeat, as a respectful person... I cannot be called that word, that you are using now, young man! Sirs, what time is it? What time is it? - Fool. - Oh god. - Fool. - Fool. - Fool. - Fool. Fool, fool, fool. Fool! Fool! Predetermined! Predetermined! Second floor and to the right! Predetermined! Where? Eh? Where? Not the one. Excuse me. Wait. Husband Come here. Come. Come here. - Husband. - Whose? - My husband. Come here. Here. Come here. Under the bed. Well, under the bed. Come. Stay! - Come, I'm telling you. - No. - No! - Yes, yes, yes. - Yes, come. - No! I beg you. I beg you. - I beg you. - Crawl under the bed. Hurry. Lizonka, Yefrosinya broke something again. Are you alright, my dear? I see. I see that you are fine. We sat down, my dear, to play preferance with Fedossey Ivanovitch, and how my back has begun to hurt. - Who's here? - I told you who. - What? You... - Lay down, shush. Don't speak. - And you should go to bed. - This damn hemorroid. No sitting, no standing. It's cramped in here. This is impossible for me, I'm in a terrible position. - And I'm in an unpleasant neighborhood. - My dear sir, you forget yourself. - You don't know who you're talking to. - I know. With the gentleman lying under the bed. But I was surprised here, an error, and you, I believe, are immoral. But here you and I are on the same level. So, my dear, Fedossey Ivanovich says to me: he says, have you tried Achillea? - Do you hear that, my dear? - Yes, yes. And I say, I've put on leeches, and he, to me: "No, Alexander Demianich, Achillea is better, it opens it up". What do you think, my dear? I think that trying this substance isn't a bad idea. Why did you not just say what time it is? - It's impolite, sir. - Excuse me. A quarter after ten. However. And you, he says, perhaps have consumption. I say: gout and irritation of the stomach. And what do you think, my dear? Consumption? My god, what are you saying? My dear, you ought to begin to undress. To go to sleep. And I'll sit here in the meantime. For God's sake, fullness. After. And you are probably this lady's lover? Alas, no. But wouldn't that be nice. Do you also think that she's not too bad looking? Well, you sure have good morals, my dear sir. How delightful are those feet. A spirited woman. How she threw us under the bed. Seems like it's not the first time. Do you think he'll sleep here, then? With him, it will happen. Not every husband is like you. Some even sleep at home. - Would you like any? - I don't drink, thanks. I can't just lie here until morning. They're waiting for me. - You know, I... - Well, someone was waiting for me, too. Now they are probably no longer waiting. Who? Where are they waiting, I mean, not waiting? My dear. There is something here like cats, whispering. What kind of cats? What are you imagining? Cats, my dear, cats. I came in here the other day, Vaska sitting in my office and "Shhh." I said to him: "What's with you, Vasenka?" And he again: "Shhh." I even think that he might be whispering to me from beyond the grave. Oh, what nonsense you're talking about. For shame, please. Well, it's nothing, it's nothing, my dear. Don't be angry. Don't be angry. I see that it doesn't please you that I will die. But, really, really, it's only here. almost like mice. Mmhmm. One time cats, another mice. I really don't know what's with you today. My dear, someone is whispering. That's just the wax in your ears, sitting wrong. Ah, it's because of the wax! Here, at the new neighbors', to the right of the staircase... What does he mean, to the right? Damn. This door was open. - And I came in here. - I also needed to go to the right. And I came in through the open door. For God's sake, young man, Why you are interested in the right door? And so, to the right I met a pretty one. A pretty one? I said earlier that I met a pretty lady on the stairs, or did I forget? My memory is poor. - This is St. John's wort? - St. John's wort. One has to drink St. John's wort. They say it'll make it better. Yes, it'll get better. Well? You were saying that you met a pretty one. Ah? - Who then? - Yes, you were saying, a pretty one. Me? When? Ah, yes, yes. - I remember. - At last, you damn mummy. Well? Yes, yes, yes, I remember. Such a little rogue. She comes here to see acquaintances. Makes pretty eyes and such. And acquaintances also go to see those acquaintances. Understand? My god, the things you're interested in. Well, I won't talk, since you're in a bad mood today And what eyes, in a velvet hat. In a velvet hat? Oh-oh-oh! She also has a velvet hat, dear god. Who is she? Who is she? Careful. Careful. - What are you doing? - Answer. - How did you get here? - And who are you, dear sir? You are a stranger, I see. But who are you, stranger? You are taking part of something here, true, that's why... What is that, my dear? Dear god, that's somebody making noise behind the wall. Behind the wall, to the right.. And I was even saying that it was a dandy with whiskers. And even now singing, singing behind the wall. Behind the wall he sings. That is someone making noise behind the wall. Hear that? Yes, true, behind the wall, singing. Dear god, I'll have a stroke tonight. Dear sir, help me. I am afraid, I'm terrified. Help me, help my despair. That is, it's not my despair. I'm not the husband, I'm-the lover. - Lover? - Yes, I'm - the lover, same as you. Her husband is - my friend, a friend from childhood, and I'm - the lover. I'm - the lover. Laugh, laugh, I also laughed like this in my own time. And are you in fact the cuckolded husband? Oh-oh-oh, now there'll be an inflammation of the brain. Stop it. Stop it this instant. Go on, stop. Stop it. It's a good thing. One will leave - then he won't even think that there is another. Go on. Ah, listen, how well they're singing. Stop it. - No, I changed my mind. - Go on, stop it. I have my own plans here, you'll interrupt me. My dear sir, well, then, what about me? What am I? Allow me. Who am I? Again the noise. It's behind the wall. No, my dear, this is not from behind the wall. - No, behind the wall. - No, not behind the wall. See, Amishka is howling. There's probably mice. Or Vaska the cat is sitting there. Mmmhm, Vaska the cat. Or the mice. - Oh lord, I'm going to sneeze. - Quiet! Shoo! What a hooligan. I'm more respectable than you. Why are you punished? Because you are jealous. Running around like mad, Bursting into someone else's home. Frightening an innocent lady. Disturbing a venerable old man, depressed by diseases. Understand then, the old man who loves his wife would go mad if he sees how you're lying under the bed. You must forgive me. My dear, Vaska has the sniffles today. - You should go to sleep. - He sneezes, and sneezes, and sneezes. You should go to sleep. Well, well. I'll leave. And yet, no, stay. Oh, no, go. Well, go. Go, go. At the Panifidin girl's, I saw a Nuremberg doll... Well, what doll? Well, what doll? - Go, then, go. - Liza. - What? - You don't love me at all. I love you, I love you. But I'm tired, but I love you, I'm tired. Amishka. Amishka, come here. My friend, well, what's wrong with you? - You're all pale. - Amishka. Now we're going to have trouble. Lie still. - Maybe she'll stop. - Good heavens. If you, God forbid, hurt her, we are lost. You don't know the heart of a woman. Heavens, how this dog can howl. - She's silent. Amishka. - That's it, we're done with. - Amishka, Amishka. - Oh my soul, my soul. Vaska cannot eat her, after all. - You have to find Vaska. - Why Vaska? There are people there. - Strangers. - Who? - What kind of people? - There, under the bed. People? There are people. I see someone's boot. Well now, crawl out. Crawl out. - Crawl out. - Your Excellency... Who are you? Tell me, who are you? - People. - For heaven's sake... For God's sake, your Excellency, do not call, For God's sake, do not call people, it is absolutely unnecessary! There. Murderer. Murderer. - - Your... Your Excellency... - Murderer. Yes, I'm guilty of Amishka's death. I am accidentally guilty. Don't! I'll explain everything. I'll explain everything, everything, everything. I'm not guilty. I'm not guilty, it's my wife. That is, not my wife! Don't! Someone else's wife! - Amishka. - I'm not... I'm not guilty! On the Voznesensky bridge! And I'm not guilty! Like that! This is my friend! A friend from childhood! What friend from childhood? You're a thief. You came to steal. Not a friend from childhood. - Executioner! Executioner! - Your Excellency, look at me. According to certain signs and symbols you will see that I cannot be a thief! Don't! Don't! Your Excellency, You - lady! Executioner. Your Excellency. Your... your Excellency. I am a miserable man, I am drinking the chalice. Well what business is it of mine that you drink? You didn't only drink one cup, by the looks of it. But how did you get in here, dear sir? I will explain everything to you, as if to my own father. Because you are in such years that I can fully accept you as a father. What years? - Maybe I have offended you, eh? - Who are you? Your Excellency, I'm not the lover, no. Your Excellency, your wife, your wife is clean and innocent. How dare you say that? How dare you talk about my wife? I thought it was Vaska the cat who we have under the bed, sneezing, and it's him. Who is he? Where does he serve? Your Excellency, please don't "Who is he", don't "Where does he serve". You would do me a very great favor, Your Excellency. I would give you a hand, but I don't dare to. Your Excellency, don't get angry. You understand that love is - a delicate feeling. Oh, I'm entangled in lies, your Excellency. What I mean is, I'm an old man. But no, I'm an elderly man, not an old man. I cannot be your lover. Who is the lover then? Richardson, Lovelace and I just, I had the wrong door. That's it. See, your Excellency, I'm an educated person, I know literature. How glad I am, your Excellency, that I provoked such laughter. Oh dear me, dear me, what a funny person. How glad I am, your Excellency, that I provoked such laughter. How funny and how filthy. - Filthy. - Dear, he could not have been a thief. But only, how did he get in here? Oh, it's certainly strange. Rinaldo Rinaldini, it's similar to a novel in some ways, your Excellency. And I will fetch a new lap-dog for you. So little, and so good. Long fur, a short nose. It'll run, and run, and fall. Funny, funny and filthy. Where could one like this serve? Don't, your Excellency, don't "who is he," don't "where does he". I... I am, your Excellency, you know, totally happy. I was mistaken, and now I've opened my eyes. My wife is clean and innocent. Stay. Come back. My dear, he's married. I would never have thought. - Do you know, my dear, who this is? - Who? That pretty woman at the neighbors', who makes the eyes, with a dandy, who has a mustache. I bet that's his wife. Don't waste time, run, run. Maybe... maybe you'll still catch them. I'm definitely going to fly off, your Excellency, but I'm not going to catch anyone. Well if you catch them, then come back and tell us all about it. Oh no, even better, invite her over here, I'd like to meet her. I'll be sure to bring her, your Excellency. - Stay. - Stay. Come back. I, well... Vaska, the cat, I never did find him. Did you meet him while you were sitting under the bed? Alas, no, your Excellency. He still sneezes and sneezes. We must whip Vaska. I agree completely, your Excellency, that a corrective punishment is necessary for household pets. What? I completely agree with you that a corrective punishment is necessary for bringing out submission. - With houshold pets. - Ah. Well, good luck. God be with you. - Where have you gone? - What? Silence. Before they were drinking, and now they're silent. Call them - you'll scare them off. The only thing left is to break down the door. Here. Here I'll do it with this. Well then help me! This is a general matter, after all. Here we go! - My dear sir, with all due respect... - Help me! I'm a gentleman. Such illicit behavior, I cannot. Yeah? So get out of here. No, no, no. No, no, no, no. - Fool. - You're just a cocky young man. You were replaced, now you're breaking in. My wife is probably waiting for me at home. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - My wife is clean and innocent. On the Voznesensky bridge. And someone else's wife and childhood friend, huh? - And you, I see, are not Shabrin? - What Shabrin? - You know Shabrin? - What Shabrin? - Do you know him? - What are you talking about Shabrin for? - Shabrin is an honorable man. - An honorable scoundrel, he is. Married a girl, got three hundred thousand. Yes, an honorable man, a nobleman. Robbing the treasury. - You don't know the whole story. - Me? Me? - Yes. - Quiet! They're coming. - Let me in. - Where? - No, wait. - Careful. - No, wait. - My leg! My leg! It's opening! I'll catch the sled. I'll catch the sled. - I... - Glafira! Where are your vows? Who were you with? My husband is here. Go, go. We've just come back from the Polovitsins'. But the Polovitsins have moved, I know everything. - Who told you? - Your husband, madam, he's here. He will be in front of you, he'll confirm it. Ivan Andreyevich! C'est vous?! C'est moi. Heavens, how I was worried! I was at the Polovitsins', can you believe it. But you know that they now live on the Izmailovsky bridge. I told you, remember? I took out the sled, the horses went mad and drove off. They broke the sled, and I fell a hundred paces from here. They took the coachman, I was beside myself, but here, fortunately, Monsieur Tvorogov... Yes, Monsieur Tvorogov turned out to be close and accompanied me. And now you're here, Coco. And I can only wish my deepest, warmest thanks, To the dear Monsieur Tvorogov. Monsieur Tvorogov, my acquaintance. I had the pleasure of seeing him at the Skorliupovs' ball. - Well, I told you, remember? - Happy to be acquainted. The sleighs are served! The sleighs... - Who is this? - My husband, Monsieur Bobinitsin. Imagine, what a meeting. My husband leaves from the General Polivitsin's, they're good friends, but it seems that the Polivitsins have moved. Jean, Monsieur Bobinitsin, at the Karpovs' ball, remember, Coco? When the horses broke free and Monsieur Tvorogov kindly accompanied me, I was beside myself, but Monsieur Bobinitsin just then returned from the opera and was singing Italian arias so sweetly. Everyone, stand! Everyone, stand! Just as I thought, it was him making the noise. That, sir, here, Your Excellency, as you ordered, sir. - My wife, Glafira Petrovna. - Charmed I'm sure. And we know each... Charmed. I wish you all luck. Yes, yes, yes, don't forget the lap-dog. - Don't forget. - I'll bring it, your Excellency. I'll be sure to bring it. Such a pretty one. Exactly as if it was made of sweets. As I say to my wife, remember, darling? How is it all falling apart? Later. I don't dare to bother you, your Excellency. Wonderful to have met you. Let's go, my dear. Goodbye. Goodbye, sirs. We will all probably see each other at the Sazonovs' ball. Coco, are you coming? I'm shivering all over, it's terribly cold. Go on. Look who you resemble now. Is it true that you went looking for me again? You wanted to disrupt a meeting that I don't know who set up. Oh, shame, sir, soon people will point fingers at you on the street. What is this? This is a letter that I wrote to you. I was so worried that you were worried. And you? Upon my word, sir, the wife is dying with worry, says the note, and you're not to be found. Where should the note be sent? Fortunately, I met Julian Astafevich, And I...
