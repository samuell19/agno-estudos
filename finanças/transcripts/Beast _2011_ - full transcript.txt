There's a lot we don'ttalk about. - Such as? - Lots of stuff. How we feel about each other. - Okay, so how do you feel? - Well ... I hate you. That's one thing I hardly eversay to you. Thanks. I hate that you think I think you can't live without me... - but I know you can live without me. And that's exactly why I love you. - And what else? - I hate yourfeigned solicitude. Your pathetic self image of being good and giving. You nevergive anything. You can't. You're a beast. I love you because you're a beast. What do you want me to do? How can I make you love me again? Tell me. Tell me. I can feel you. What have I done wrong since you can'tfeel me? - Don't you care? - No, I do. What is itthen? - Justtell me. - I don't know whatto tell you. I have to go. I can'ttake any more of this. - Stay. - I can'ttake it. Do you understand? I can'ttake it anymore! No, I have to go. Stop it ... Bruno, stop it! Leave me alone. I have to go to work. Are they still trying to kill each other? No, they've settled down. - Have you gotthem? - Yes. Thanks. Are you okay? - What's going on? - I boughtflowers. Is thatso strange? No, notstrange at all. What's wrong? What's wrong? Tell me. Go on. Why did nothing turn out like we dreamed? There's still time. Sure there is. - No. - Do me a favor. Put aside all yourfrustrations and all the plans you make without me... - and everything that's keeping us apart, and be with me. - I can't. - Sure you can. - Try! - It's too late, Bruno. - It's nottoo late. You can do it. - I can't. - Yes. - I can't! We can't. You have to! Thank you. What? - Rememberthe firsttime? - Whatfirsttime? The firsttime we met. I was so anxious. - Why? - To see if you came. Who you were, and what you wanted. - I was anxious about everything. - You miss that? - I'm still anxious. - What about? To see if you come home, if you're there... - who you are, what you want. You're just curious about yourself, Bruno. Oh yes. You love yourself. You can'tstop observing yourself and sensing your reactions. You're yourown greatestfetish, did you know that? - I feel a bit upset now. - Don't. I've always known who you are, Bruno. Who am I? You're the man who loves so much, you must destroy what you love... - so it can be yours. And who are you? I'm the woman willing to be destroyed. What do you want? What do you want? What is it you want? I want, very slowly ... calm as I've never been before... - and with a poise I've never had before... - to make an incision in your bosom. And cut open your perfect marble skin. See it come apart... - so that I with all my love can plunge my way in. And with an unquenchable hunger... - I will put my mouth to your beating ventricles... - and have the blood fill up my mouth. Cut. More! Eat me! I wantto be inside you. - Eat me. - You're already inside. Hello. I've booked a room, and I'd like to pay for it. - Hi, Benny. - Hi, Bruno. Adrink? Nottoday. I have a favorto ask of you. I have these two messages. Would you write one there? - And the otherone here? - Sure. What do you need itfor? - Maybe someday I'll tell you. - Okay. Secrets. - There you go. - Great. Thanks. - It's strange. - What is? I thought I knew you, that's all. I didn't know you were ... - The kind who wentto a hotel. - Well, I'm not. I don't mind. I'm justsurprised. - But you wanted to go to a hotel. - I said that? No, you wrote it. I wrote to you I wanted to go to a hotel? It was your idea to meet here. Very funny. Stop it. - Stop it. - I'm not joking. Let's ... I gotthis. Let me see. Who the hell did this? - Did you write this? - No. Whatthe hell's going on? Whatthe fuck? Did you tell anyone? You told Bruno. No! This is creepy. It is pretty strange. - Are you okay? - Sure. I just don't want you to be afraid orgetsecond thoughts. How can you always be so certain? Aren't you everscared that what you feel is right might be wrong? Not with you. I'm certain about you. - You are? - Yes. - Well? - Hi. The hotel clerk didn't know anything. Jerk. No phone number, no nothing. How is that possible? - It's so strange. - I know. Well, here we are. - At a cafe. - And you're holding my hand. I could get used to this. What? Aren't you afraid something might happen? Sure I am. I'm terrified. - The hell you are. - Sure I am. But I ... - I'm going to tell him tonight. - Tonight? - And what about Vera? - Yeah ... - And you? - What about me? - When are you going to do it? - Well, I'll tell hertonight. Or maybe that's too obvious ... Tomorrow. In a couple of days. I'll wait a couple of days, and you'll do ittonight. - You'll be mine all the time? - Soon. - Let's go. - Now? Aren't we having you and Vera overfordinnertonight? We are. You're joking. Maxine speaking. Yes. Okay. Sure. I'm on my way. - Excuse me. B3? - That way. But he's still asleep. It's my husband. What happened? You gave me a scare. I gave me a scare. Feeling better? Take a wild guess. I stopped guessing a long time ago. - Do they know what's wrong? - No. The doctors don't know anything yet. I've missed you. - I don't believe you. - It's true. Yeah? - Does that hurt? - No. - It's fine. - You're not pregnant, are you? - Huh? - No. - Not hiding a little bastard in here? - No. Good. Because you know what? - I'd have to kill it. - I bet you would. I'm going to talk to a doctor. Okay? - Want me to get a wheelchair? - No. My legs are just a bit wobbly. - When are Valdemarand Vera due? - I cancelled dinner. - Isn'tthat overreacting a bit? - Well, I didn'tthink so! - Invite them again. - It's too late now. - I know, buttomorrow. - I'll call and ask them. They still look so fresh. I'm so glad they didn't die. - I wantto ask you something. - Let me just getthat. Maxine speaking. No, it's okay. I'll be atthe shop tomorrow at 10. Can we meet? Not now. Tomorrow or ... No, we're back home. Sleep tight. Me too. Bye. - Sit down, please. - Why? I wantto ask you something. Sit down. - Oh, look. - Leave it. Just leave it. Please answer me ... Answer me truthfully. I won't be offended. - We both know that's impossible. - I mean it. Did you foreven a second hope I was dead? - Today? - Today. - That you'd die of stomach cramps? - You didn't know what it was. Did you deep inside hope you were finally rid of me? - Do you want me to say I love you? - I want you to answer me truthfully. No, I didn't. What a mess. - Is he at home? - Yes. - Is he very ill? - I think so. - What am I going to do? - Damned if I know. What if he dies? - Think he's going to? - Maybe. There's a risk he might die? I don't know. Maybe. - What do the doctors say? - Nothing. Butthey mustsay something. - Justthatthey think it's serious. - Serious? Poorguy, huh? Poor us. Yeah, well ... Do you still have sex with Vera? - Where did that come from? - Do you? - Do you still have sex with Bruno? - Answer me. - No. - Never? Notsince we started seeing each other. Are you afraid I won'tfollow you? Should I be? Would you stay with Vera, if it wasn'tfor me? Maybe. Could you live with a man you didn't love? - Huh? - I already am. You're not living with it. You're doing something about it. I am? It's a bit hard for me to do something now. - Why? - He's sick. Should I leave him now? So wait. I don't wantto rush you. I'm the one who said we should wait. Maxine! Maxine! Come on. Just come on. Where are we going, Bruno? Have you sinned? - I hope so. - You hope so? Don't we sin whenever we desire something that isn't ours? It's not a sin to want more. - I guess not. - It depends on what you want. So, you desire something sinful? - Don't you? - I want you. That's not wrong. - Is it wrong? - Depends on how you want me. I'm justtrying to see you. I'm trying to see and understand you. - You can't. You don't understand me. - I did understand you once. - Yes, but not anymore. - Why don't I anymore? I don't know. Maybe it just doesn't last. Being together. Sharing everything. Maybe you turned into you, and I turned into me. I just don't understand. Hello! Give me something. Give me something! I want you. I love you. Do you understand? You've gotto give me something. Tell me how we get it back. - How? - We can't. - We can do everything. - We can't do anything. Bruno? - Good to see you. - You too. - How are you? - Fine. How about you? I heard about yourstomach ... That was just a stupid misunderstanding. - So, let's gettogether. - Sure. Sounds great. I think Maxine called you about ourdinner. - She did? I didn't know. - She called you. She must have talked to Vera then. I haven'ttalked to Maxine ... at all. - So, dinner? - Are you busy? - Generally speaking? - A beer? - Now? - Now. Let's grab a beer. - I need to close up the gallery. - Oh, cutthe crap! Let's get a beer. We're going fora beer. Let's go get a beer. Alright. Hello there. - We'd like a ... soda. - Beer! - Draught? - Yes. - So, is everything okay? - Yes. How about you? Everything's fine. I'm content ... Well, you're never 100% content. You're not? Well, you know. At ourage we've resigned to the fact... - we'll never reach those blue mountains. - Am I right? - We? Oh, at ourage, you mean. - Well, haven't we? - I'm still fighting. Sure, butthe disappointment of not having reached them has lessened. - Thanks a lot. - Thanks. Cheers. - How very sad. - Itsounds sad to you? I didn't mean it like that. I see it as a positive life-goes-on kind of thing. - Got a plan? - In regard to my dreams, you mean? - Is Vera partof that plan? - How do you mean? Vera, your wife, is she partof that plan? - Maybe she is. - You sure sound sad. Let me just getthis straight. Vera isn't partof the plan, or ...? I don't know. Maybe. - That's not very upbeat, Valdemar. - Well, I don't know. Stuff like that hasn't really got anything to do with anyone else. In other words, it doesn't matter who you're with? - That's not what I said. - That's what itsounded like to me. - What's with you? - You said it was up to oneself. - So it doesn't matter who you're with. - What's eating you? - Nothing. - You're just being so inquisitorial. I didn't mean to. I'm just curious. How about you? Have you got any dreams? I wantto get inside Maxine. It's like I haven'tseen her. Not in the obvious sense... - but like everyone else. Outside of me. It must nevercome to that. Never! She must be partof me. - Something has happened to me. - Okay? It's as if I'm born again. I can feel her. She's with me. In ... my body. In my blood, my vision... - and in my entire perception of everything around me. And I must get inside her, so she can feel the same as me. - Think you can? - I must. Well, that's great. What's wrong? - What's going on? - Sit down! Sit down, okay? I'm fine. Sit down. Sit down, forfuck's sake! Do you hate me? - No, I'd just like to call someone ... - Answer me. - Are you trying to rob me of my life? - No. If you let me down, do I have your permission to act resolutely? It's my right. I don't quite follow you. I don't understand ... If you hurt me, I'll strike back! Understand? I'll strike back, if you hurt me! No more! Stop it, Bruno. Stop it. What's going on? - I feel great. - Something's wrong, Bruno. Why do you keep telling me something's wrong? - I feel fucking great! - You need a doctor. Don't be a petty little person with no eye forgreatness! - Oh, rise up, woman! - You're sick. Don't you understand? Don't be a measly little bug, or I'll crush you under my feet. We need to call a doctor. Maybe nothing more can be done than is expected of the unknown. I'm sorry. Bruno? Are you there? - What's going on? Where am I? - You were unconscious. What's going on? Let me out of this. - Keep still. - Someone get me out of this! The ambulance came, because you lost consciousness. - Your wife was worried. - I'm justtired afterdays of work. I'm justtired. Let me out! - What is this? - Please letthem ... Let go of me! Let go of me! - Bruno ... - Don't you everdo this again! I'm very sorry. I'd like to speak to Lasse. It's Bruno. Thanks. Hello, it's Bruno. Is this a bad time? I just have one question. I'm considering putting my condo up forsale... - and I was wondering... - if I could do it without letting Maxine in on it. Without her knowing. It's impossible? Okay. Look, I'm ... I'm getting second thoughts now. I'll think of something else. Sorry to bother you. Yes. Bye. - Hello, Bruno. - Hello. - What can I do for you today? - I need a book on carving. - Meat carving? - Yes. Acow ora pig or ... Let's see what we've got. I've gotthis book foraspiring chefs. Here's an illustration of how to carve an ox. Planning on filling the freezer? - This is fine. - Okay. - Charge itto youraccount? - Please. Hello. - A knife? - Yes. - Got anything special in mind? - For meat. Forcarving or boning? - Carving. - Okay. - Large chunks of meat? - Yes. - Rough carving. - I'd choose something like this. With a nice big handle, a good grip... - and the old-fashioned Japanese style blade "V10 Gold"... - the hardeststeel in the world. - It's quite light. - You wantsomething bigger? Yes, this is not what I had in mind. I pictured a bigger knife. I need itfor rough carving. This is good forgetting in between the bones... - but if you wantsomething bigger, you're looking at a real chef's knife. Itsure is a fine-looking knife. Very nice. The otherone was too small. Hello? Hello? What's inside of me? Hi. - I saw your husband yesterday. - What a surprise. I bumped into him on the street, and we wentfora beer. Something's wrong. He said that if I hurt him, he'd do something to me. He said that if hurt him, he'd strike back. - Then he asked, if I hated him. - Oh. Well, what ... what do you think? Not a whole lot right now. - What do you mean? - What I said. Okay. This is ourfirst defeat. You feel I've let you down ... No. - What's wrong? - You're getting second thoughts. Aren't you? You're getting second thoughts. - Aren't you? Answer me. - I just ... Is itso strange to ... What do you want? I thought I wanted you. - You thought you wanted me? - Yes, I thought I wanted you. - Find out what you think you want. - You don't know? You can'tfeel it? What don't you understand? - What's all this? - We're having guests fordinner. - Valdemarand Vera. - When did you talk to them? I arranged it with Valdemar. Come and sit down. We need to talk aboutsomething. Putthat down, please. There is something ... we need to talk about. I'm sorry I've been a bit overthe top. I've settled down again. Let's putthe past behind us and look ahead. Let's focus on what's important to you and me. - Ourfriends, for instance. - Okay. Friends are importantto you, aren'tthey? - I don't know what you mean. - You don't know what I mean? - What do you mean? - What else is importantto you? - I'm just asking. - You're being strange. I just wantto know what's importantto you. - What is this? - What's importantto you? - Ourfriends and our home ... - Did you try to call them? They confirmed you didn'ttry to call. What is this all about? Look ... Maybe I ... didn't leave a message. I don't remember, what with your being sick ... I'm notsick. You're notsick. Well, then ... We're having a conversation here. I'm trying to find out what's importantto you. - To both of us. - Are you giving me the third degree? Okay. Yourfriends are important, but not enough to get a hold of them. We've gotthatstraight, right? Okay. I'm importantto you... - but not enough for you to listen to me and understand that I'm notsick. What, then, is really importantto you? - What's importantto you? - Isn't it obvious? You are. There's no price high enough to be with you. None! - You don't believe me? - I don't know whatto believe. - You think I'm lying? - Your words make no sense to me. I'm not lying. There's no price high enough to be with you. None! What are you doing? Have you gone mad? - What did you do, baby? - I hate you! Bruno, come back. Bruno! Bruno, let me out! What's happening to you? What's happening? Give me that. - Give itto me. - Do you want me to stab you? Do you want me to kill you? Let go. Please ... You fucked everything into shambles! All the beautiful things we could have shared. Fucking whore! And that's why you must die. You're going to die now. You don't deserve my love. And now ... you're going to die. Don't you love me anymore? No! Die! Die! Die! Die, damn it. Die! Die! Die! Die! Subtitles: Helle Schou Kristiansen Dansk Video Tekst
