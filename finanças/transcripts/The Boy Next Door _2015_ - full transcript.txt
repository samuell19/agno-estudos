I wanna come home, Claire. Let me come home. Please. Just get out. Get out! Don't tell me Dad's not coming back. Don't tell me that. Kevin, wait. Kevin? Claire. I love you like a sister, but you have got to get those divorce papers signed and move on. It's been nine months. What? Are you having second thoughts? I'm having dinner. With Garrett? oh, you pussy! It's for Kevin's birthday. Honestly, Vicky, sometimes I think you're rooting against us. Who's "us"? You and me, or you and him, because I kinda thought that was done. He's the father of my kid. Who cheats with the secretary every time he goes to the home office. Brings a whole new meaning to "the San Francisco Treat." Not funny. He said she smelt like chocolate chip cookies. Goodbye. I'm just quoting his email. You don't have to! Okay? Because it's burned in my mind. Forever. And for your information, he doesn't go to San Francisco anymore. So, stop bringing it up. It's not fair. Ta-da! Make a wish. Happy birthday! You made that? Of course! Come on. I've been waiting all day. I want you to see this. Okay. I'll help you. One, two, three! Ta-da! Oh' my G“! Dam Huh? It's like a high-powered gaming tower with an arctic cooler. And you made this? Three weekends in a row. Triple processor. Dad, thank you so much. Let's do cake. What are you guys doing for Labor Day? I don't know. Why? I thought we'd go camping like the old days. Mom, too? Yeah, of course. That's what I was thinking. Oh, it will be a lot of fun. We could catch fish, and, Mom, you could cook it. Yeah, that sounds like a lot of fun. Please? Look at you, you got schmutz everywhere. Go clean up. Okay. All right, be rig ht back. Come on, what do you say? Um... When were you thinking of going? I get back from a business trip the Thursday before Labor Day. Business trip? Yep. Get back Thursday night, we'll leave, three days. Where? That old cabin we used to go to at Mammoth Lakes. That sounds great! No, I meant where is your business trip? Let me guess. San Francisco? It's work. It's not what you think. Does she still work there? Claire, it doesn't matter. No, I guess it doesn't matter. Mom? Yeah? So, you coming or not? Mmm. You know what? That's the weekend before school starts. So, you know, you guys should just keep it a guy trip. You'll have a blast. Okay Okay Kevin! Honey, we gotta go. Kevin! I know. Mom, the door is jammed. Mom, look, can we just forget it? Because I don't wanna see another doctor, okay? He's not gonna tell you anything any different. He is the best allergist in the Valley, okay? We're going. You know what? I'll lift the door, you pull the cord. Okay. Okay. Okay, you ready, Mom? Just pull it up! It's too heavy. It's too heavy. Pull it up, baby. I got n. I can fix that for you if you want. And you are? My nephew. Oh, hey, Mr. Sandborn. Noah. I'm staying next door with my uncle. Claire. He's hereto help me when I get the, uh' bone marrow transport. Right. "Transplant," Uncle Bob. "Transplant." Oh, yeah. He's got a real knack for fixing things. I can, uh, lake a look at this real quick. Hey, how you doing? I'm Noah. Kevin. Yeah. Um... I don't know what the issue is. It might be off the track, but... Nah. Actually, it's the clutch. We can get another one at the hardware store if you want. You wanna go? Come on. Well, you know, we actually had somewhere to be, but now that we're gonna be late... Mom? Okay Go ahead. Cool. All right. It was nice meeting you. You, too. Uncle Bob'? Are you gonna be okay? Yeah, sure, I'm fine. Look at me. Hey. Love you. MR. SANDBORN: Love you, too. His parents died last year. I'm all he's got now in the way of family. He seems like a nice boy. Yeah, he is. You up for some coffee? Yeah, sure. Sure. Come on. So, the entire time, it was the clutch. Mm-hmm. How old are you, anyway? Almost 20. But you're not from around here. No. San Bernardino. My uncle, actually, my great-uncle, uh, he needed help, I needed a change, so I figured I'd go back to school here. You mean college? There was this, uh... Accident. So, I lost some time. So, I'm gonna finish up at Monroe High. That's where I go. My mom teaches there, actually. She seems way too cool to be a teacher. She is cool. For a mom. Okay. We got everything. Good to go? Yeah, let's go. Okay Here you go, sir. Thank you. Whoa. Can you, uh, pay for this? What? Uh... Look, that's Allie Callahan, okay? She's the most beautiful girl in school and I just can't think when I'm around her. So, just, can you... I don't know. I hate to tell you this, but she's already seen you. Just go on and talk to her. And say what? Just tell her, "Here are some garage parts. How much?" Go! Wow. Very funny. Yeah. Come on. Thank you. You want me to fail. Hi. Hi, Kevin. Hi, Allie. Um, I didn't know you worked here. My dad's making my brother and me do split shifts to earn gas money. It could be worse. If you didn't have a brother, you'd be working full time. Noah Sandborn. Allie. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. I'm friends with Kevin here. I'm gonna go look around. Okay, sure. So, you're having a good day? Yeah. Great. How about you? Actually... Hey, check it out. LOOK who it is! Whiz! Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Okay, okay! Jason! Guys! FORREST: Did you pee-pee? Oh, what is this, huh? Come on. Is this your EpiPen? Your little penis purse? You guys, stop it! Get out of the store! The kid still pisses the bed. All three of you, get out! Okay, all right, fine, fine. See you later, Whizzy. Stay away from liquids. Hey, Noah, are you ready to go? Uh, Allie, how much is this gonna be? I'll ring n up. Clutch is in. We're all good. You thirsty? Yeah. Thanks for fixing the door. And for including him. Hey, there was this kid at the hardware store giving him a hard time. Jason Zimmer? Um, skater kid, red hair, permanently dumb look on his face? That would be the one. Kept on calling him "The Whiz.“ He actually had an incident a couple of years ago on a playground where he got stung by a bee, and his throat swelled up and he panicked and lost control. Whiz. Whiz. on, man. Kids can be cruel. Especially kids like Jason Zimmer. But, please, don't tell him I told you. He'd be mortified. You can trust me. Anyways, uh, you're all set. This is very exciting. Very exciting moment. It works! Thank you. I'm gonna take off this cover real quick. Put it over there. On the ground? Uh, wherever. Just set it down, doesn't matter. Set it down'? Yeah. All right, now this bad boy right here is the alternator. You know what this does? No. It charges the battery. So, I'm gonna do one piece of it, you're gonna do the other, all right? All right. All right? Yeah. You're actually going the opposite way. Yeah. All right, we're gonna check out the alternator. You're loosening it up rather than tightening it. How's that? It's in there. You wanna finish it off, Noah? I'll just do it in there. Okay. Yeah, this one needs two... Make sure it's actually in there. To the right? Okay, I'm changing the subject. Um, how long will your uncle be in the hospital? Um, I don't know. It's all about the transplant taking. Well, until he's better, you can come over for dinner here anytime, okay? I don't want you eating by yourself. I mean it. Thanks, but I don't wanna impose. Oh, I do. Especially if she's making the guacamole. You are not an imposition. Are you saying I am? Mmm. Well, in that case, l wouldn't mind imposing on your literature class. Oh, no, dude, you don't wanna do that. They call her "The Crusher." Is that what they call me? Yes. Yeah. You know what? Carry your own plate. Clean up all the dishes. Now he's really worried about it. Strange kid. Why? Can't put my finger on it. Don't try so hard. Okay. He's interested in literature? In the classics. Back in San Bernardino, we were studying the Odyssey. You want me to help you outwith that? Sure. Here you go. You know, I'm teaching Homer next semester. Really? He's my favorite. You're kidding, right? Second that. Dude, you gotta read the Iliad. Achilles is this total badass. Hot-tempered, full of pride, completely consumed by his emotions. You know what he called Agamemnon? Who? "A pitiful excuse for a king." To his face. He killed this guy, Hector. But instead of hiding out like a pussy, he... Dragged his dead body around for everybody to see. Yes! He stood by his actions, right or wrong. Well, because to him they were justified. Do you have any idea what they're talking about? No. No. Homer's a genius, my man. Just like Shakespeare, Byron, Zeppelin, Dylan. Ugh. Poets. Poets. Poets. I'll have him back Sunday afternoon! Bye, Mom, I love you! Oh, hey, Noah, come on in. You know, Kevin already left. Actually, I, uh, picked something up for you. Oh, my God, this is a first edition? I can't accept this, this must have cost a fortune! It was a buck at a garage sale. One man's trash.“ Noah, I can't. Honestly... Claire, please! I've been eating here every single night. It would mean a lot to me. Thank you. Those yours? Oh, no. They were a gift from Vicky. Why? Those kind of shoes are for women trying to be sexy. You don't need to try. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have, uh... No. No, it's okay. Where are you? Almost there. Well, hurry up! Vicky, I can't do this! I haven't had a date in 18 years, I don't even know what to do anymore! Three things. One, laugh a lot. Two, take off your wedding ring. Three, give him head. What? Kidding! Just get here, pronto! And the closer I get to this car, the smell is getting stronger and stronger. And I walk up to the guy's window, rolls down the window, I look and on the passenger seat is his dead dog! You did not tell me that. So, Ethan tells me you teach. English, is it? The classics. Wow. What does that mean? Oh. No, he just means as a compliment, like, "Wow, you teach the classics." It's fancy. I mean, I don't know how many kids nowadays are going to use what they learn from classics. No offense. Oh, none taken. lam a vice principal and I just want to see these kids employed. Shall we order? Silly me, I just want them educated. I'm fine with education, but we gotta get them working. Practical skills. That's where the money is. Ah! Money! That's the goal, then. Oh. Ethan, how's your mom? Gallstones. Oh, gallstones. Mm-hmm. Are those the ones you pass'? Or are those the other stones? Yeah, she's getting better. You know, money's fine, except when it's motivated by greed. You're a little firecracker when you get riled up, aren't you? I think it stopped raining. Firecracker? Is that how you regard women with an opinion? Only when they disagree with mine. Pleasure to meet you, Benny. No, Claire, stay, stay! J. K. Rowling. I'm sorry? Billionaire. Classics major. She's a lot of laughs. You gotta get to know her. Hello? Question. I tried to defrost a chicken in the microwave. And some of it's kind of cooked, some of it's kind of not. Do you think it's still cool to eat the cooked part? No! Do not eat that! Then, please, come over and bail me out. Um... Um... Uh... Okay. Perfect. Okay. Yes. See you soon. Okay I mean, that date was awful. Like that chicken. I'm sorry I couldn't salvage it more, but... You did fine. The damage was done. Yeah. I'm glad I had you next door. What? God, you're beautiful. You know that? Oh, no, I'm... Amazing. And sweet, natural and sexy. So sexy. Noah! Kiss me, Claire. Just... I can't. Just once. Please. I have to go. Tonight, in the window... You were watching me. I can't do this! Noah! I want to watch you now. This can't happen. We can't. It's wrong! It doesn't feel wrong, does it? Wait. It feels so... Oh, my God, stop. ...nice. Soft. Please, please stop. Noah, please! Stop. No judgments. No rules. Justus. Oh, my God. A woman like you should be cherished. Loved. Let me love you, Claire. You are perfect in every way. oh, my God! Hey! Where are you going? Home. I gotta get home. No, you don't. Kevin doesn't get home till later. Have some coffee. I can't. This... Was incred
