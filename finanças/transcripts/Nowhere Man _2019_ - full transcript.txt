Sir. Please. If you need to smoke, do it in the designated areas. Yes, sir. Sorry. Teacher Zhao and I are just waiting for the rest of the band in the restroom. Behave yourself, Du Zih-ciang. Ah... Fu Xing, shh. How long have they been gone? Sir. Sorry, they're VIP guests, so I didn't really check. Teacher Zhao, come on. Let's go find them. Sorry, sir. Sorry. Please. Fu Xing! Chapter 4: Old Friends A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES Attention! Greet the warden! Attention! Good afternoon, chief. - Good afternoon. - Call for Ding Chang-quan. No. 111, Ding Chang-quan, show yourself! Sir, he said they threatened him, and they've got his family. They can't have run too far. We are in big trouble. Hurry up. Hurry! Sir, the drain's big enough for three people, but... - But what? - It stinks. Sir, someone blocked the passage with a huge load of compost from the other side. I'll play it. Play it exactly as you read it. I don't need to, sir. It's a very popular oldie. I know it by heart. Yes, that's why I want you to follow the notes. Fine. You're the officer. I'll do what you say. Fu Xing's score book is a fake. The highs and lows are a mess. I have perfect pitch! Sit down! I didn't do anything. What's your problem? - There should be one more. - They're all here. I mean the guard. He went to report to the warden. Call him. Calling Du Zih-ciang. Sorry, warden. I can't wait. Madam Zhao, speak slowly. Such a group of polite men. Three of them were wearing black suits. Like people from the funeral service. Was I scared? Just a bit. But look... They bought a toy for my granddaughter. Do you call that threatening? Not really. They chatted with me, even gave me some supplements. Sir, the teams report the same about the family of the other three band members. They weren't threatened. The family members don't want any trouble either. Fuck you! Gui Ge. Thank you.

Last time, I rolled cigarettes with white-tip oolong leaves and fresh rose petals. This time, I'm using pu'er. Pu'er is good. I tell you, many leaves make a good cigarette. But I think this is the best. Nice. I did some research, too. You see that plant? I planted it myself. Wang, you know what this flower is called? Jimsonweed. It helps with insomnia. Some people even use it for pain relief. Calms you down. I used it in the army, in the wilderness. I've been growing it for a year or so, trying to get it right. Do you think when you smoked it, it had an effect? Radio time reporting: 15:00, 23rd July, 2019. Next up, this one's from Wang Wang in Taichung. Wang Wang wants me to say: "It's been so many years, but the best time of my life was always school. When I saw you that day at the reunion, you looked even more beautiful than you did 20 years ago. I wish you were old and ugly so I could let go. But I couldn't. Maybe that's my problem. No matter how I look at you, you'll always be beautiful."

EVERYTHING IS NEW DREAM OF THE RED CHAMBER The drain... was built in 2001, but abandoned by the previous warden, Lim, many years ago. The plan was to remove 12 manhole covers and add a cement slab on top. However, due to the green-space planning, one manhole remains, buried one meter under the southwest garden. There have been three changes of wardens, and the information never got passed on. The prison's oldest inmate was Sha Shi Ying. His jail sentence was from 1984 to 2018. He passed away at the age of 72 earlier this year. Tang passed the information about the manhole to his cellmate, Ding Chang-quan. Ding Chang-quan, Cui Wan-fu, and Xiao Sa were able to use this to successfully plan their escape. Next, a new contract guard, Du Zih-ciang, is also under investigation. He's suspected of being an accomplice in the escape and threatening the security of some VIP guests. Asshole. This is him. You can check his medical records. Du Zih-ciang, ID Number A133726488, suffered a sudden stroke and cerebral hypoxia. Admitted about two years ago. It took so long. Don't fucking waste our time. So what? Watch your mouth! We're doing business here. Don't fucking mess with us. Hey! Sister Bai Lan's here. Sister Bai Lan. It's happy hour, Inspector Yang. I'm in a hurry. Where's Gui? Hmm. Dao. Bring the girls in, all of them. No need. Where is Gui? Who says they're for you guys? I'm just showing you all my employees. Gui isn't one of them. He doesn't work here in the club. I will watch you. If you have a plan B, C or D, go ahead. Do whatever you can. What's your plan B? I mean, now, what happens... if I... provide some special service? This kind of place provides entertainment services. Underneath our clothes, we're all just men and women. So next time you or your men come, just show your police badges. I will offer you a 40% discount. Do you have anything to do with the missing child? Whatever you're all up to, I will find out. Pinkie promise. Take your time. Don't let it go soft on me. My name is Lin Ji-zi. Bai Lan calls me Lin Ji. You guys could call me the same, Lin Ji. It's okay. Fuck. Lin Ji, you were amazing. We could be partners in a movie. I want to see Jing-fang. Yes. Sister Bai Lan has it arranged with priority for the safety of Tian-you. Which adults does Tian-you know, besides you? That fucking cop, his godfather. Otherwise, his art teachers, all women. They'd kidnap him just to see you? Nah. Question is... who the hell wants to see you that much? Enemies? Any enemy would be our enemy. We're always together. What's yours is mine. We'd know if you had beef with someone. Anyway, we're on fucking death row already. Bring you out of jail for what? But Gui Ge... for the last ten fucking years, Quan has... one, always worried about our plans failing, Fu Xing getting caught and thrown into solitary, and two... he actually likes death row, thinks it's some fucked-up punishment he deserves. For the last ten years, he's never been with the fucking plan. But that day, out of nowhere, you tell me, and I fucking quote, "He will." You remember? You said it. "He will." And then his son suddenly disappears. And someone demands Ah Quan to appear, get him into the whole escape. Then we get that fire, then that tunnel idea on a platter. It's like a film or a book. How the hell did that all happen? It's too coincidental. For fuck's sake. Seriously? So after all this time, you're the same as Jiang Jing-fang. You think I was involved? No, it's too much of a coincidence. Just too much of a coincidence. Why were you so sure that you said "He will"? Fuck you, ass. You're suspecting me now? Why? After all these years, I still know you. You really want to know? I asked the gods. Read it. "One shot into the sky. The road is cleared, but you will need luck. All human intention and fate are intertwined. What you do will succeed. If human intentions and fate succeed, you will get what you want." Human intentions and fate... Fuck. Jiang Tian-you being kidnapped is "fate"? Human intention. Then what's fate?! The fire. Fuck. Fucking right! When the prison sirens started, I had goosebumps all over. I know the fire was started by the glasses, but when it really burned, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. If those sirens hadn't gone off, then Lin Ji would have had to go start another fire. We would have been screwed backwards. Ah Quan, did you pray, too? I had a strange dream. A dream? A dream?
