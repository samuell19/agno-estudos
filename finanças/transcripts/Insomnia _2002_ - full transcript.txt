There's just nothing down there. I haven't seen a building in 20 minutes. - Look at that. - We're not on vacation, Hap. Cheer up, will you? - Tell that to her, partner. - Better hang on, guys. It's going to get rough again. There goes my lunch. Detective Eckhart. I'm Detective Ellie Burr. Let me help. "Halibut-fishing capital of the world." OK. Detective Dormer, it's an honour. I'm Detective Ellie Burr. Welcome to Nightmute. The car's right here. It's... incredible to be working with you, Detective Dormer. I've followed all your cases: Dineli, Prud'homme, the Ocean Park shootings, and especially the Leland Street murders. Is that where Ronald Langley cut you in the basement of number 325? You certainly did your homework, Detective. The Leland Street murders was my case study at the academy. I'm going to take you guys over to the lodge and... No, just take us to the station. Right. We need to get started. Most homicides are solved by work done in the first 72 hours. Well, it's 48 hours. We're a day behind. But who's counting? - Come in. - Put you behind a desk, huh? Charlie Bubbles. How you doing? I haven't seen you boys since... - Hey. - I don't know. Seven years? - Eight years. - Seven years! I am old. Ellie, get everyone over. I'll show you off. - Nice kid. - Loves the job. Yeah. When I called Buck for advice I never actually expected he'd send you guys up here. Some bullshit going on down there with Internal Affairs? - They're moving in. - Come on. It's nothing. It's the usual crap. Buck just figured you could use help. Those fuckers are wading through files looking for headlines... It's going to blow over. - Message from a guy named Warfield. - IA's pit bull. He wants to be posted on your movements. It's a bit more straightforward up here. Good guys, bad guys, but less public relations. It's simple. Except for this. Ahem! OK. So... Detectives Dormer and Eckhart, on loan from Los Angeles Robbery and Homicide. - Helping with the Connell case. - Helping? We're lucky. Anything they want to see, show them. Any place they want to go, take them. Fred Duggar has been heading the inquiry. - Hello Fred. - Pleasure. - You right on it? - Want to see what we got? - Yeah. First, the body. - You got the report? - I want to see the body for myself. - OK. She died of brain-stem herniation due to intercerebral haemorrhage. Beaten to death. - These contusions? - Superficial. Most of the trauma was to her face and the top of her neck. - Any signs of rape? - No. This one covers an older bruise. There's an older one here too. - They're both in the report. - He washed her hair. Scrubbed her nails. It's all in the report. Doesn't say that he clipped them too. - She may have done it herself. - No. No polish on the ends of the nails. She painted them herself. Someone else cut them shorter. Toes too. - Naked when found? - Yeah. Last seen in a red paisley dress. No fibres, flakes, hairs? We know about forensics work. The body gave us nothing. Oh, she gave us plenty. All this trouble, all this care. Why? He knew her. He knows we can connect him to her. This isn't some random psycho? A crime of passion? Maybe. But whatever happened, his reaction wasn't passionate... He didn't panic, he didn't chop her up or burn her. He just thought about what we would be looking for and then calmly removed all those traces. No haste. No rush. Why would he clip the nails after scrubbing them? Manipulating the body? Prolonging the moment? No mutilation. - Not this time. - You think there's been others? No. But there's going to be. This guy... he crossed a line and he didn't even blink. You don't come back from that. OK. Let's go find out who Kay was. Fred said not to touch anything, so I haven't tidied up. She hates it when I go into her room, anyway. Thank you, Mrs Connell. So she went to a party Friday night? Well, not exactly a party. It's a local dive where the kids hang out. - No diary? - We didn't find one. But her mom said she keeps a journal. She argued with her boyfriend Friday. She stormed off just after midnight. She did, huh? This is interesting. - Who is this? - Tanya Francke. Kay's best friend. I want to talk to her. Who is Kay Connell? Who is she? Was she popular or was she a loner? Did she like this town? Did she want a boat first chance she got? Did she have dreams? She knew this guy. We know her, maybe we can know him. This is designer. This is expensive. - The boyfriend, Randy. - Randy Stetson. - He could afford it? - Still in high school. - Well, her mother didn't buy it! - What do we think? Oh, I don't know. A stepfather? Any rich uncles? No. An admirer. Yeah. I want to meet the boyfriend. - I can get him to the station. - No. I'll go to the school. In his class. Pull him out from his friends. Catch him off-guard. I want to get people talking. So how far away is the school? Ahem! It's ten o'clock. - You bet. - At night. When does it get dark around here? It doesn't. Not this time of year. Yeah, I heard about that. How come you didn't know, Hap? - Lower 48. - Lower 48? You're not from here. I can tell by your walk. - How's that? - Unsure. Dormer and Eckhart. We have a reservation. Don't be fooled by his frivolous demeanour. He's all business. - Your restaurant still serving? - Yeah. About to close, though. We'll be quick. Thank you. Thanks. We got the halibut Calabrese, we got the halibut Olympian. - Keep going. - Or the Cajun style. I can't wait to see what they got for dessert. The natives are getting restless. - We got to talk. - No we don't. - We just sit tight? - Nothing's changed. No? What the fuck do you think we're doing in the halibut-fishing capital of the world, Will? Buck figured Charlie could use the help. Buck figured IA would be coming to me next. And he was right. Warfield had me in his office for three hours yesterday, Will. Hap. He's rattling your cage. That's all. Me and Trish talked it through. And I'm sorry, but... I got to cut a deal. Don't even say this shit to me. You're not going to be involved. Of course I am. With your reputation you're safe. My reputation's the whole problem! You think Warfield gives a flying fuck about you shaking down a couple of drug dealers? You think that'll get him his headlines? He needs the big fish. He's putting the squeeze on you to get to me. It's simple. But you're clean, Will. I'm a good cop, but there's always something they can use to get at your credibility, you know that. Have you any idea what this is going to do? Just think about all my cases. All the cases depended on my word, my judgment. All those fuckers back on the street. - That's what you're doing. - Bull. They got nothing on you. Dobbs. - What about Dobbs? - That's different. Even Warfield doesn't want shit like Dobbs on the street. It's a house of cards, man. Once it starts, it's just going to tumble. All of it. It's a chance I got to take, pal. - I got family. - Don't give me that shit. Warfield made it clear. I get probation... We're cops, man. This is not about us. This is about all the people who depend on us. People with families. I spent my life doing this. My life. You're going to destroy it. Like that. Why? Why? So some IA prick gets one step closer to being chief of police or playing golf with the mayor or whatever the fuck else he's after? You finished? Sorry. I got to cut a deal. So. Make any decisions? - You do everything around here? - After eleven, pretty much. Over to you, Will. What are you having? Lost my appetite. Excuse me. Morning. Hi. What kind of calls do you get around here? Mostly drinking-related problems. Domestic abuse, bar fights, that sort of stuff. People here come from all over. They live how they want to, so most people keep themselves to themselves. They won't let me take anything over a misdemeanour anyway. Don't knock misdemeanours. But it's such small stuff. It's so boring. It's all about small stuff. Small lies, small mistakes. People give themselves away the same in misdemeanours as they do in murder cases. It's just... human nature. Aren't you going to write that down? Friends making you nervous? They think you did it? - You killed her? - No smoking in school. Did you love her? - Randy, did you love her? - Sure. She was nice. She was nice? Wow! Well, that makes me all soft inside! Did it ever occur to you she didn't love you back? She loved me. Wanted me every night. Probably to pass the time, I think. A girl like Kay, she was looking for more than some loser. Right? What can I say? Love is blind. - You live alone? - With his grandpa. You don't have an alibi for Friday night. - Don't need one. - What did you fight about? Stuff. It was no big deal. I heard it was a loud fight. - I guess. - I heard it was pretty rough. - It wasn't rough. - Not like the other times. You know those times. She wouldn't listen to you. - Couldn't keep her mouth shut. - Keep fishing, man. - We saw the bruises, Randy. - They said she was beaten. Not those bruises. Randy, come on. The old bruises. Your bruises. I'm sick of this. I haven't done anything wrong. You haven't? Fuck you! You're just a little prick in a leather jacket. What the fuck do you know? Randy. This whole thing you're doing, this fuck-the-world act. It might work with your mama. It might even work with these local cops who know you're too dumb ever to kill anyone without leaving a few witnesses and a signed confession. Ain't gonna work with me. Because I know things. You understand? I know you beat your girlfriend. I know she was seeing somebody else, somebody she might have even gone to see after she walked out on you Friday night. Now, are you going to tell us who that somebody might be? Or are you so fucking stupid you're going to leave yourself as the last person to see Kay Connell alive? - I don't know. - You don't know? I couldn't get her to tell me. How hard did you try? Pretty hard. - You think he...? - No. - How'd it go? - Find out where this came from. Mrs Connell doesn't know. Nor did her friends. Did you try the jewellery stores? Small things, remember? Just as you're about to dismiss something, think about it. Look at it again. Want me to write that down? No, I'll remember it. Ellie Burr. Where was it? - In a cabin on the beach. - Sure it's Kay's? - Looks it. - Kids found it. - Cabin secured? - Francis is on his way. Well, you stop him. Tell him to stay clear. Rich! Biology and algebra. Let's find out who she studied with. Let's find out where she bought this. Otherwise Engaged, another J Brody mystery." - Who reads this kind of crap? - I do. Read it. After it's dusted. Find anything that strikes you: Plot, underlined passages. - Just let me know. Anything. - There it is. Diary. Every word. - I'll put it into evidence. - No. - Why? - Ellie, call every radio and TV station from here to Anchorage. Say we're looking for the bag Kay Connell left the party with. - Get it out in the next hour. - You got it. Fill that bag up with books. Put it back where it was found. Let me eat the son of a bitch alive, knowing he missed something this big. You know something, Charlie? Maybe it isn't such a hot idea. Guy picks up a bag, that don't make him guilty. - Will, it's solid. - I don't know. This kind of thing, I don't know. Maybe we do this by the numbers. - Come on, Will. - The IA will be on my ass. I don't want this in court six months from now when my rep's in the shit and they're pulling apart my cases. - Come on, that's bullshit. - What the fuck do you care?! Someone beat a girl to death. Your job is to find him. You're a cop, not a lawyer. Don't let IA cut your balls off. Charlie's right, Will. OP One, this is OP Two. We've still got nothing. - Nice and light. - All plastic. Except for the barrel and firing pin. Never rusts. - What do you carry in LA? - Smith & Wesson.45. - Anything? - No. Maybe this guy doesn't listen to the radio. Prefers the voices in his head. Hey, Will? OP One, we got somebody moving towards the cabin. OK. Fan out. Nice and easy. Let's go! Police! Police! Come out! Fuck. Down there, huh? All right. Down to the water. Go! Spread out! Go! Fuck it! Dormer! Hold it! Who's there? - You OK? - OK. I'm OK. - Will. - Don't talk. Don't talk. Here. Here. Here. You... you sho... I know. I couldn't see him. I couldn't see in the fog. Here. You tried to... you tried to kill me? Hey, fuck you! No, listen, Hap. Listen. Tried to kill me! Kill me! Get away! No. I couldn't see in the fog. I couldn't see you. Hey! Don't go. Man down! Man down here! Dormer, where'd he go? Which way? Dormer! Which way? That way. Farrell went down. You gave chase. Yeah. After you left Farrell, you heard the killer's second shot. You ran down to the water. You found Hap. Will? Is that what happened? - Did Hap say anything? - Goddamn! Why didn't I know about the goddamn tunnel?! You don't go for an armed suspect without knowing his exits. Look, Will. There's a bunch of those tunnels out there. They closed 60 years ago when they were mines. I don't even know most of them, and I grew up here. I had him, Charlie. Close as you are now. I could smell the son of a bitch. And I blew it. There's no point in blaming yourself. I fucked up everything. Don't you come apart on me now. I need you to find this bastard. Yeah. - You wanted to see me? - You're on Eckhart's shooting. But... we know what happened and... I'm on the Connell case. Anchorage want to send someone. I told them we can handle it. - We can, can't we? - Sure. Write it up. Just enough to fry him for a few seconds longer. Am I right, Will? Hello? Jenny, it's Will. Can I... can you put your mother on? Hello? Trish... it's Will. Whats happened? They wont tell me anything. It's Hap. Is he OK? He's gone, Trish. He's dead. What? Trish, I can't tell you how sorry I am. What was he doing, Will? This guy killed a girl and so we... we had him... we found him and we had him cornered and then he ran and then... Hap... I'm so sorry. - I'm just so sorry. - Did he suffer? - Well, no, I don't th... - Did he say anything? When I found him, he... he was peaceful. - Did you get him? - No, no, not yet. Find him. And when you do, you dont arrest him. You understand me, Will Dormer? Dont you dare fucking arrest him! - OK, Trish. - You understand? OK. Trish, listen. I'm... ...was shot and killed earlier this evening in an abortive attempt to apprehend a suspect in the murder of 17-year-old local girl Kay Connell. Sorry. It's been on the radio for hours. We don't... Not used to this kind of stuff up here. He was standing right there. Last night. I hope I was nice to him. He liked you. Detective? I'm sorry to bother you, but could you point out here where you were when you heard that second shot? I'm really sorry that I have to make you do this right now. It's all right, Ellie. You're doing your job. - Where was I? There. - Thank you. No sign of Farrell's bullet yet, huh? No, but we'll have the other one for Ballistics after... the autopsy. I'm really sorry. - How you doing? - OK. - Clean through, huh? - Yeah. No souvenir. Bullet's in the rocks, I guess. Well, better luck next time. - You ever been shot? - Yeah, I have. Kind of itches, don't it? We got to catch him. Did you get a look at him? - When? - When I left you. - Did you see anything? - I was in a lot of pain. When I heard that second shot I kept my goddamn head down. Sorry about Detective Eckhart. Sorry about that megaphone. - Maybe if I hadn't... - Farrell, listen. What were we doing out there anyway? Were we doing it for our health? We were chasing someone! So anything that happened on that beach is not your fault. That's the fault of one man and one man only, and that's the man who beat Kay Connell to death. At this point Dormer encountered Officer Brookes. The suspect, obscured by the fog, shot Officer Brookes in the vastus externus of the upper left thigh. Francis, you're Farrell. You were shot in the leg! Come on! When you get this shot make sure we get the cones. - Is this his blood? - Ketchup maybe! Was he eating a hot dog? Anything he might have dropped or stepped on, put in a bag. Cigarette butts, gum wrappers, coins, anything. A suspect will often leave something behind. Detective Dormer gave chase, losing the suspect in the fog, then heard a shot coming from a north-easterly direction. - He wasn't lying that way. - How do you know? Cos I saw him. - He was round this way. - Are we almost done here? My nads are freezing off. Ellie! I think I've found something! Shouldn't we start further over? No, it's a waste of time. He stayed down by the water. I saw him over the rocks. He knew he'd lose us down there. Duggar. Where'd he find it? OK. Yeah, just... let me know. Dormer. They found Farrell's bullet. Looks like a.38. After the autopsy we'll get both bullets to Anchorage, get a fix on the murder weapon. That is, if it's OK with you. Guy came by to see you. Said he was your new partner. - He leave a name? - No. Can I borrow this? Thank you. - Pioneer Lodge. - Warfield for Dormer. Detective? John Warfield. He's called a couple of times. - Want me to lie? - It's all right. I'll take it. Thank you. - Dormer here. - A shock about your partner. Its terrible. I was just getting to know him. - What do you want? - We both know what I want. And you know Eckhart was going to give it to me. You got something to say, why not just say it? Bet he told you about our conversation. Say it. Lets just say Im very interested to see your report on what happened yesterday. Don't presume to know what happened. You weren't here. Then again, you never are, are you? You're always sitting safe behind some fucking desk reading your bullshit reports, and that is why I have nothing but contempt for you. You and all the assholes like you. Risk nothing, spend all day sucking the marrow out of real cops when you never had the balls to be one yourself. - Detective. You came yourself. - Yeah. Sign here. He didn't suffer too much. - What's the calibre? - Don't know. The victims I see here are from hunting rifles and shotguns. It wasn't one of those. - Had any sleep, Detective? - Yeah. - Jesus. - What the hell's wrong with you?! Sorry. No problem. Bullet. I want results by tomorrow morning. Aye-aye. Let's check on Randy's whereabouts two nights ago. You think it was Randy out there? He still has no alibi for the night Kay died. - And you say he beat her up. - You check it out. I will. Detective Dormer. Detective Dormer? My report. I finished it. I just need you to look it over and sign it. - It's pretty self-explanatory. - Yeah? I want to get back to work with you. I know we have more important things to do than paperwork. A man died, Ellie. This is important. I didn't mean to imply that... Be sure of all your facts before you file this thing. It's your name on the report. It couldn't have come from there! Dormer here. Hello? Cant sleep, Will? Me neither. Who's this? I got a nap this afternoon but I guess you had to work. - Who am I speaking to? - Get rid of your clock yet? Wont help. I once went five nights. Can you believe that? This crazy light. - A name or I'll hang up. - No you wont. You need the company. Nothing as lonely as not sleeping. Like the whole fucking planets deserted. Just you and me. So... why don't you tell me who I'm talking to? We can chat a while. - I cant do that. - Why not? Not till you understand a couple of things. - Like what? - I saw... Saw what? Saw you shoot your partner. Saw him die in your arms on that beach. Thought youd try to blame me. Thats why I dropped my gun. - My uncles old.38. - Yeah. Did you pick it up? What about Ballistics? Listen to me now. I don't know what you think you saw, but we should discuss this, don't you think? Face to face? This isnt yours to control. I saw you do it, get it? I'll control this situation, pal, because you don't hide from me in a town this small. Get it? No, not for long. Thats why I need your help. So dont worry, I wont tell anyone anything. Were partners on this. ...but to be remembered as the Kay we knew and loved. Swimming, hiking through the Kebaughs, eating at Darrow's after school. And always, always with a smile on her face. Detective Dormer? I want to check something with you. I was going over your report last night and I have a question about where that second shot came from. See, you said you heard it from the waterline, but from the way Detective Eckhart's body fell it couldn't have come from the rocks further up from the water. So might you have heard the shot before you hit the waterline? - Detective Dormer? - Yeah, it's possible. Yeah. - Why don't I give her a ride? - Thought I smelt something. How you doing, Randy? You still coping? - You're that cop. - Yeah. Are you coming or not? Not. You want a stick of gum? I love chewing gum. Keeps me awake. I never met anyone from LA before. You're not missing much. So how do you like our shit-hole town? It's not bad. - Were you friends with Kay? - Yeah, best friends. - Since grade school. - Boy, that's a long time. Yeah, we were like sisters. Like sisters? Must be tough for you what happened, then? Everyone keeps saying I'm doing great, considering. But they're all real worried about me. They don't even care if I show up for school or not. They're worried I haven't cried yet. But... ain't no law says you got to cry, right? No, there ain't. What about her other friends? Do we have to talk about Kay right now? God... I don't want to think about all that. Let's just drive. I understand. Want me to take you somewhere? As long as it's fun. Young, impressionable girl, left alone with older Los Angeles cop. - Who knows where we might go? - Well, I know a place. Well, let's just drift a while. Look at this. Who does he think he is? What's he think he's doing? - Move over. - Let him move! Come on. Move over! What are you doing? Move over, you crazy fuck! OK, I moved. A visit to the dump! You should feel at home here. You just about fucking killed us both! Get off me! What the fuck is this? So you and Kay were like sisters? I told you already! How come there's torn pictures of you in her room? Why was her guy's hands all over your ass at her funeral? Randy has no alibi for Friday night because he was with you. You were out fucking your best friend's boyfriend. That what best friends do? She never really loved Randy. She didn't really love him? That's interesting. - She had someone else? - Don't know. Someone bought her dresses, jewellery, all that shit? Look around. Come here. I'll show you something. Now you'll understand why we're here. This is the spot where your best friend's naked body was dumped. Wrapped up in garbage bags! Tanya, I know you don't want anyone knowing you betrayed your best friend with Randy. That's why you will not give him an alibi for Friday. I know that. Tell me who Kay was seeing and we can forget the whole thing. - It'll be our little secret. - I don't know. But I need a name. I don't know! She wouldn't tell me, OK? She wouldn't tell you? You were her best friend. It was her big fucking secret! - Secret? Why a secret? - I don't... Cos she thought she was special and... she was going to get out of here and he was going to help her. - Who? Who is "he"? - I don't know. - But she talked about him? - Yeah. - To you? - Yeah. When she talked about him, what did she call him? - She called him something! - Yes! What? What did she call him? Brody. She called him Brody, but that's not his real name so what's the fucking difference? Jesus! You happy now, you fucking asshole? OK. You did good, honey. Come on. You want to drive? It's just poetry. I read it line by line. It's nothing specific. Nature, love, all that stuff. Detective Dormer? Line one. - Dormer here. - How you holding up? Cant be easy to keep working after three days of no sleep. Hard to keep focus. Are you seeing things yet? Those little flashes? Tricks of light? Seeing your partner? - I see Kay sometimes. - What can I do for you, sir? Why couldnt you tell anyone you shot him? I mean, it was an accident, right? I should hope so, for your sake. You know what I'm saying? No need for threats. Im trying to make you understand my own situation. You thought no-one would believe you because of the trouble in Los Angeles, right? I know what thats like. I got the same problem. You do, huh? Im not who you think I am. - You're not? - No. Im not a murderer any more than you are. Then why don't we get together? Just talk. Have a few beers. Throw a little gas on the fire, huh? Yeah. I got to check some things out. Why don't you put this stuff back into evidence and tell... what's his name? Fred. Tell him I'll see him in the morning. Oh, can we return this? Her mother might like it back. Sure. Yes. That's right. Oh, shit! Here. This is Walter. To leave a message, wait for the beep. Will, are you there? Where else could you go in that state? You must have been freezing. Take a shower. Should be clean towels in the bathroom. This is Walter. To leave a message, wait for the beep. Pick up! Im not dumb enough to come back. - Walter Finch? - Will. Will Dormer. What are you doing? Im trying to help and youre running around like a maniac. Were you going to kill me? How would you explain that one? No-one gets upset when child murderers come in feet first. Theres no evidence. You only know cos I told you what I saw on that beach. Whats wrong with you? Guess I'm a little cranky. - Lack of sleep. - Get some rest, will you? Ive got pills in the bathroom and my beds comfy. Another night up and youll really lose it. Hallucinating, babbling... God knows what. Tomorrow, when you feel better, well meet. In public. Well sort things out, OK? Theres a ferry five miles north of Nightmute. Ill be on the eleven oclock. Before you leave, can you feed the dogs? Theyre on a diet... Dormer? Fax from the lab. Murder weapon was a.38 Smith & Wesson. And we found something else worth checking out. I found this. At the Connells'. And? It's the author of the book found in Kay's backpack. It's signed by the author. A local writer. Kay had all his books. We should check it out. - Small stuff, right? - Yeah, sure. Nice work, Ellie. - She's got sharp eyes, huh? - You bet your ass she does. Good stuff. What a view, huh? - I'm not who you think I am. - No? Walter Finch? Lousy writer? Lonely freak? Murderer? No? When I was seven, my grandmother took me to Portland. We were walking along. Two guys snatched her purse. Later a police officer came to ask questions. He stood the whole time. Uniform looked brand-new. Shoes, badge were polished. Like a soldier, only better. I respect your profession, so I write about it. I wanted to be a cop after high school. Couldn't pass the tests. You should have tried Internal Affairs. They'd have taken you. What do you want from me, Finch? After Kay died, I knew everyone would think I meant to do it. I cleaned the body, removed all evidence that connected to me. Except for your fucking novel! Under pressure, you don't always see the wood for the trees. You, for one, should have figured that out by now. When I heard they had brought somebody from LA I panicked. I knew the locals would connect me to Kay eventually, but I could handle them. They never look in the eyes of a killer. Killing changes you. You know that. It's not guilt. I never meant to do it. It's like... awareness. Life is so important. How could it be so fucking fragile? You'd see it right away, wouldn't you? Are you trying to impress me? Because you got the wrong guy. Killing that girl made you feel special. But you're not. You're the same pathetic freak I've been dealing with for 30 years. You know how many of you I caught with your pants down? - I never touched her like that. - You wanted to. Now you wish you had? Best you could do was clip her nails. Now you're so different! You don't get it, do you, Finch? You're my job. You're what I'm paid to do. You're as mysterious to me as a blocked toilet is to a plumber. Reasons for doing what you did? Who gives a fuck? Motivations are everything. What did you see through the fog? I saw pretty clearly, didn't I? I saw you take aim. Forget it. - Shoot Eckhart in the chest. - Oh, wow! I heard him say, "Get away from me!" Why? Anything to do with that Internal Affairs inquiry? All that tension in your department? You think I'm that easy? I'm just saying that's how it looks. Maybe even how it feels. How did it feel when you found out it was Hap? Guilt? Relief? Suddenly you're free and clear. Ever think about it before then? What would it be like if he wasn't there any more? It doesn't mean you did it on purpose, you know. You figure if you got something on me, then I'm just gonna roll over to protect my reputation? No. Protect your life's work. Every scumbag you put away will be freed before you go on trial. With Hap gone, you're free and clear. Why mess with that? Kay Connell. Remember her? It's your choice. Think of all the other Kay Connells. Do the math. You're a pragmatist. You have to be, in your job. I know it isn't easy, but I'm trying to get you to see we're in the same situation here. You didn't mean to kill Hap any more than I meant to kill Kay. That's hard for them to believe. That's why we need each other. We've got to find a patsy for the Connell case, make it stick. Do that, and you go back to LA and I can go back to my life. So what do you need from me? What do they know about me? They found a signed copy of one of your books at Kay's house. So you'll be brought in for questioning. At the station? That's what they usually do. At the station. Brought in for questioning. I can write that easily! Calm down. It's no big thing. It's a preliminary inquiry, so you... just tell the truth. Well, I'll tell them about Randy, how he... Why talk about Randy? Talk about your relationship with Kay. You can't hide it, so you just say it. Randy is none of your business. It's not your affair. Shouldn't I tell them that she was unhappy? Tell them that, but just let them find Randy themselves. That way they'll make it stick. Understand? We need a wild card. - A wild card? - Yeah, something that's there. Something we can use. It's in every good detective novel. You still have the.38? No. Really? That's a shame. We could use that. That'd be very convincing for them. This is my stop. Dormer! Wild card! - Night, everyone. - Good night, Francis. Working some overtime, huh? - Nice! - Cracking some big cases? - Good night. - Night, guys. - Yeah? - Its the worst time of night. Too late for yesterday, too early for tomorrow. - What do you want? - Sorry about the tape. I had to make sure you'd follow through. I'll follow through. Ive been thinking it over. I should tell them about Randy. - I think that's a bad idea. - But hes the patsy. And he deserves it. You should have heard what Kay said. - How he abused her. - Dammit, these are cops. They're not children. You don't just throw that in their lap. Leave Randy to me. I'll push him their way when the time's right. But we don't have the gun. How do we frame him without it? - Unless I tell them... - You keep the dress? - Dress? - Kay's dress. Her nail clippings? What did you do with them? That's great. The dress. We could use that. Even better than the gun. Where could he have taken the body? Where did you take her? She died in the cabin, right? - Yeah. - So where did you clean her up? Don't think about that. - This is tough enough for you... - But it was an accident. Yeah. I didn't mean to kill her. You know that, don't you? I know. Now, what happened? She called and said that she and Randy had had a fight. And she wanted to come over and talk. She said, "Meet me at our place." That's the cabin at the beach. She comes over, distraught and a little drunk. She tells me about how Randy and Tanya were carrying on. I only wanted to comfort her. Hold her. I kissed her and got a little excited. She started laughing at me! She wouldnt stop. Ever had that happen when you're like that, when you're really vulnerable? Laughing their ass off at you? Someone you thought respected you? Ever had that happen? I wanted to stop her laughing, that's all. And then, you know I... I hit her. A couple of times. Just to stop her. Let her know. Get a little respect. Randy used to. I think she liked it. She never blamed him. She never wanted to leave him. I do it, she starts screaming! She wouldnt stop. She's terrified. Screaming. I put my hand over her mouth. And then I'm really scared. I'm scared shitless. More scared than I've ever been. You know... I'm more scared than her! And then... everything was clear. There was no turning back. After that, I was calm. Real calm. You and I share a secret. We know how easy it is to kill. That ultimate taboo. It doesn't exist outside our minds. I didnt murder her. I killed her, but it... just ended up that way. So where'd you take the body? Thanks for listening. Feels good to talk about it. I'll be able to sleep now. You want to talk about Hap? - Morning. - Your phone isn't working. I know. I turned it off. I... needed the sleep. Sorry. Fred called that author. He was more than happy to cooperate. He'll be in first thing, so we need to get to the office. Good. I forgot to say, a chain sells these in Anchorage. No way of knowing who bought it. OK. I bet you're looking forward to getting home when this is over. Back to Robbery Homicide? Or... maybe not. What are you saying to me, Ellie? Nothing. Are you doing OK? You haven't been sleeping much. No I haven't, no. "A good cop can't sleep because something's missing." "A bad cop can't sleep cos his conscience won't let him." - You said that once. - I did? Well, it sounds like something I'd say, don't it? I'll see you back there! You were acquainted with Kay. Yes, I was. In what regard were you her familiar? - Thank you. - You're welcome. How did you know her, Finch? She was an avid reader of my novels. When did you first meet? About a year ago. She came to a signing here in Nightmute. She hung around afterwards and we chatted about my writing and how she wanted to write. Then we started talking and she asked if she could visit and talk about books. - And she did? - We became very close. She got comfortable enough to show me her own writing. - What did she write? - Poetry, actually. - Any good? - No, not really. - You tell her that? - Why would I? Exactly what was the nature of your relationship to this girl? I was someone she could talk to outside of her everyday life. That's why she needed me. Why she probably approached me. Why'd she need you for that? - Well, her boyfriend, Randy... - Randy Stetz? Abusive little prick! He hit her. - We know all this already. - But it was getting worse. - So? - It was a lot worse. Really. Why all this eagerness to talk about Randy Stetz? Well... You're right. I'm sorry. It's probably hearsay. I'd hate to say anything that could be taken the wrong way. Anything you say to us at this stage is in strict confidence. We're not a bunch of hotheads who'll draw crazy conclusions. - OK? - OK. - Please continue. - There was one more thing. It may not mean much, but I think Kay was getting scared. I probably have myself to blame. - Why is that? - Well, Randy knew who I was. Not who I was, but he knew she had a friend, a confidant, and it made him wild. She wrote about how scared she was and her letters were getting more and more desperate. You still have any of these letters? I probably do. - Do you think it might help? - It might. OK. Anything else? The thing that worried her most was the gun. He had this old handgun. He showed it to her. I don't know where he got it. It probably wasn't even his. But he said he'd use it if he found out who she was seeing. He kept it in a heating vent. In the skirting boards? Might be the.38. - Get me Judge Biggs. - What are you doing? I'm going to get a search warrant. Get Judge Biggs on the phone. I want everybody moving, now. - We should get over there. - You know what? No. - What do you mean, no? - It's you he's talking to. - So? - So we're waiting. OK with you? Mr Finch, do you know when Randy showed her the gun? February? - Get me Judge Biggs. - No, probably January. Why didn't you come to us with this when she died? She swore me to secrecy. She didn't want anybody to know. Even when she was dead? Beaten to death? - I was honouring her wishes. - Dumped on a pile of garbage? - I was her friend. - You weren't. - Acquaintance. We were close. - You were close? She was attractive. - Did you have sex? - She was seventeen. - Seventeen! She was attractive. - I suppose. - Suppose? She was. - All right. - So did you have sex with her? - No. I was her mentor. - You bought her things. - Yeah. - Gifts? - Yes. - What kind? - Books mostly. She loved them. Books? What about this? - You give her this? - Yes. Why? To see how she looked with it on? - No. - No? Then why give it to her? - It's just a present. - A present! - You bought her dresses? - Yes. What's wrong with that? I'm just trying to figure out what kind of mentor you were. I gave her things she couldn't have. You just wanted to fuck her. You're a sick son of a bitch! Dormer! - Cool it. - Sick bastard. - You need to cool down. OK? - Yeah. - Cool down. - All right. I need a break. I have to apologise on behalf of my colleague. Ahem! He's been under a lot of pressure lately. But... he's a good cop. I'd hate to see the bad cop! Search and seizure warrant. Yes, sir. Randy Stetz. We'll fill in the rest later. - We got our warrant! - Thank you. We appreciate it. Francis, you're coming with me. Let's go! - You're not going with them? - No. Are you not on the Connell case? I'm covering the shooting of Detective Dormer's partner. That was tragic. Should I call you about Kay's letters? - Yeah. I'll come pick them up. - OK. Stetz? We've got a warrant! We're coming in! All right. Turn the place over! Give me a hand, will you? Over there. Try over there. I got it. Fred! - Just in time. - Had it in the motor oil. What the fuck is this? Now he says he was with Tanya Francke when Kay was killed. - That's what she told me. - When? - When I questioned her. - Did you plan to tell anyone? Well, that's what I'm doing now. Randy and Tanya were cheating on Kay. She's trying to protect him. - What's he say about the gun? - Says it isn't his. Once we get the ballistics match he'll be more forthcoming. - So, you leaving us? - Early tomorrow. If Spencer can remember where he put the plane! I felt you wanted to kill me back there. I did. Randy Stetz is in jail. Told you I'd write a popular ending. You were too lost in the details. - Yes. He's innocent. - No, he isn't. He beat Kay. One day he'd do something worse. How did you know I planted the gun? You wanted to help me even before I taped you. You had to have a wild card. You're a good man. I know that even if you've forgotten it. When were you going to point them at me? When you found out where Kay's dress was? Where I took the body, right? You have a gun and forensics, wouldn't matter what I told them about you killing your partner. Let me have the tape. - Did you make other copies? - What? - Why would I? - Stop me from turning you in. - Or killing you. - I don't have a hold over you. You made your own choices. It's like I wasn't even here. Why kill me? It's not going to help Randy. After your scene at the station it won't help you if I show up dead. - Lot of ways a man can die. - Like an accident, huh? Like Hap. Like Kay. It took you ten minutes to beat Kay Connell to death. Ten fucking minutes! You calling that an accident? It took you a fraction of a second to kill your partner. Does that make it any more of an accident? This an accident? If you want it to be. It's over, Walter. It's over. I'll tell them all of it. About Hap. - About you. Everything. - What good would it do? - It'll end this fucking thing. - It won't end it. You're not thinking straight. Will you tell them the truth? You shot your partner. And you lied about it, Will. To them, you're a liar and you're a killer. You're tainted forever! You don't get to pick when you tell the truth. The truth is beyond that. That tape was the only proof we talked outside the station. To them, I'm just a writer that Kay Connell admired and Randy Stetz is the killer and you're a hero cop. Your life's work is intact. Another abusive scumbag is in jail. Everything is as it should be. Go back to Los Angeles. The case against Randy is pretty solid. I can take care of things here. I got it all worked out. Go home. Midnight of your sixth night. You broke my record, Will! Can you believe it? Randy Stetz. - He was an asshole. - Didn't you know him? Our dads were on the same boat. - Bad seed, man. - How do you like our beer? What Dormer needs is a little shuteye. - White nights getting to you? - Hasn't been easy. - Better than winter. - You got that right! In winter, sun barely comes up five months straight. Like being sucked into a black hole. - Hi, guys. - Nancy Drew! - You hear? We got him. - Yeah. - Rich found the gun. - I heard. Nancy has something on her mind. - I found this on the beach. - What? Shell casing, 9mm. The murder weapon was a.38 and we don't carry 9mm duty weapons. Or backup weapon, right? - Come on! - Get a hobby, would you? It's a legitimate point, isn't it, Detective Dormer? Oh, this case is closed, Ellie. Hold the fort, boys. I'm going to find the men's room. Relieve myself of some of your fine Alaskan beer. - Do you want a beer or something? - No, thanks. He's good people, right? Don't get carried away. Hey, what has two thumbs and loves blow jobs? This guy! Sorry. Well, it's been something, Dormer. It's been really great working with you. - Running Will to the airport? - No, I'll get Finch's letters. - He lives in Umkumiut! - At his lake house. Detective Dormer will just have to... leave my car at the dock, if that's OK with you. That's fine. - It's been a pleasure. - OK. Get some sleep. Detective Dormer? - What is it? - Someone's complaining about the noise. Says he can't sleep. Something wrong? Well, it's so fucking bright in here. No. No, it's dark in here. Please. There's this guy... Wayne Dobbs, 24. Works part time in a copy store. Every day he watches this eight-year-old boy waiting for his carpool across the street. This is one of your cases? Yeah. Hap and me. A year and a half ago. For six months, he watches this kid. Finally he gets up the nerve, he goes down and grabs that boy before the carpool comes, takes him back to his apartment and keeps him there for three days. He tortures him and... makes him do things. Then finally he's had enough, he gets a rope and hangs him in a storage space in the basement of the building. But he didn't do it right. The little boy's neck didn't break, so he just dangled for a while. Died, finally, from the shock. The landlord found the body five days later. The second I met this guy Dobbs, I knew he was guilty. That's what I do. I assign guilt. You find the evidence, figure out who did it, and then you go get 'em and put 'em away. This time there wasn't enough evidence. And it's reasonable doubt to a jury because the jury never met a child murderer before. But I have. Anyway, I... I took some blood samples from the boy's dead body and I planted them in Dobbs's apartment. I could feel it right there. "This'll catch up with me." "I don't do things like that." So how did it catch up with you? Internal Affairs was coming down on our department and Hap, he was going to cut a deal and bring me straight into it. They'd have reopened Dobbs's case and he'd have walked. Now that's not going to happen. And I don't know how I feel about that. But Dobbs was guilty. Dobbs needed to be convicted. So the end justifies the means. Right? - I'm in no position to judge. - Why not? There are two kinds of people who live in Alaska. The ones who were born here and the ones who come here to escape something else. I wasn't born here. Why don't you tell me what you think? Here. Now. In this room. You and me. Please? I guess it's about what you thought was right at the time. Then, what you're willing to live with. - Nightmute Police Department. - Detective Burr. Shes not here. She left about 20 minutes ago to go pick up... - Mr Finch! - Detective Burr! - Are they friendly? - Yeah. I didn't expect to see you this soon. Sorry about the mess. Doing some work. No problem. Could Kay's letters really strengthen the case against Randy? Possibly. Watch your head here. I've done it a thousand times. Sorry about all the clutter. I am a pack rat. I keep everything. I know I got 'em. Just don't know where. They've got to be here somewhere. - Working on a new book? - Have you read any? I haven't. - She knows. - Where is she? She knows you killed Hap. You'd have realised if you weren't so fucking strung out. I saw the way she was looking at you. - Where is she, Finch?! - Calm down. - It's under control. - If she's been hurt... She's OK. But if she talks, you're fucked. All your work is destroyed. - Now give me the... - Show me where she is. Now. She's OK! Listen, I mean, I... it's all fine. - Let's search this place. - What for? - For the dress. - What dress? - Ellie's. - Ellie's? - Kay's dress. - You're rambling, - Ellie's here. - You're losing it. Lucky I'm taking care of us. - She saw the dress. - What us? Where'd you get us? Don't talk about "us", you sick fuck. She's alive. Ellie! Hold it! Don't move! You shot Detective Eckhart. - And Finch saw you do it. - Yeah. - Did you mean to shoot Hap? - I... I don't know any more. I... I don't know. I couldn't see him in the fog, but when I got up close he was... he was afraid of me. And he thought I meant to do it. So... maybe I did. I just don't know any more. - Where's your gun? - He took it. Keep your head down! Listen. I got seven rounds in this clip. Make it last. Head down. OK, go! You forgot the wild card, Will. Detective Dormer? I called for backup. They'll be here soon. Dormer. Just hold on. Hold on! Nobody needs to know. You didn't mean to do it and I know that, even if you don't. No. Don't. What? Why? Don't lose your way. Hang on. Dormer? - Let me sleep. - No! Just let me sleep.
