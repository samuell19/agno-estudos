[narrator] Life is all about choices. We choose who we want to be. We choose how we spend our time. And we choose what is important to us. My name is Sam. That's Sarah, my beautiful wife. We have a baby on the way. [mouthing words] I have a tech start-up. It has potential but not a lot of money. Sarah says I work too much. And she's right. It should be the happiest time of my life... [metal crashes] [glass shatters] ...but for some reason... [paramedics chattering] [sirens wailing] ...I am in turmoil. [sirens continue wailing] Hey. [echoing] You're gonna be okay. [electricity pulsing] [doctor] Sir, stay with me. Keep your eyes open. Everything's gonna be okay! [breathing heavily] [electricity pulsing] [chattering] Everything's gonna be okay! I love you! [gasps] [electricity crackling] [monitor beeping] [grunts] [gasps, breathing heavily] [coughs] [coughs] [breathing deeply] [gasps, coughs] [button buzzes] [Sam coughs] [button buzzes] [button buzzes] [buzzing continues] [groans] [groans] [grunts] [groans] [groans] [monitor beeping] [groans] [grunts, breathes heavily] [coughs] [gurgles] [gasps] [coughs, gags] [breathing heavily] [coughing] [shouting] [grunting] [gasps, gags] [grunting] [shouts] [coughs] Help! Anybody? Help! [shouts] [Sam screams] [roaring] [both grunting, groaning] [Sam grunting] [grunts] Die! Come on! Die! [panting] Hey! Anybody! Help! Help! You gotta be fucking kidding me. [monitor beeping] What the fuck is going on? [gasps] [sighs] No fuckin' signal. [screams] Jesus. Can I help you? What's going on here? You rang the call button. I answered. What? You shouldn't have gotten out of bed. You need to stay and rest. I was attacked! By who? By hi-- What the fuck? He was just-- No fucking way. Fuck! [breathing heavily] [coma patient shouting] No fucking way. [shouting] Come on! [shouting] Come on! [shouting] [door bangs] [breathing heavily] [breathes deeply] [ceiling thuds] [ceiling thuds] [shouts] [ceiling pounding] [shouts] [elevator bell dings] Fuck! Fuck. Help! Anybody! Hello? [grunts] [elevator dings] [sighs] [sirens wailing in distance] [sirens wailing] [police radio chatter] [grunts] [gurgles] Hey. Hey. You're going to be okay. I'm gonna get you out of here. This looks bad. The other guy was drinking. Dead now. [Sam grunts] Hey. Don't listen to him. Just look at me. Look at me. Think you can reach up and grab my hand? Anything to look beautiful. Right? You already look beautiful. Oh! You hear that, Doc? She's gonna put you out of business. Oh, I'm going to make you even more beautiful. You better! Ass, nose, lips. Only have tits to go. You ready? Just relax and look up at the light. She'll stop shining it in your face any moment now. It is very annoying. Mmm. That's-- That's a bit bright. [grunts] Now I want you to count down from nine. Nine, eight, seven-- Good. Keep going down. Six, five... [faintly] four. [doctor] Three, two, one. [grunting] [monitor beeping] [sighs] [grunts] [patient whimpering] [screaming] [gasps] [breathing shakily] [gasps] [screams echoing] [patient] Help! Somebody, help me! Help! [shouting] Please! Please! No! No, no, no. No, please. Help! [shouting] Please! Please! [gasps] Hey! [whimpering] Hey! Get away from her! Help me! Please! [whimpering] Don't come near me. I mean it! [grunts] [gasps] No! Hit her! What? [breathing shakily] Come on. [whimpering] Don't you fucking come near me. Run! [grunts] That's right. What the fuck? [Sam grunts] [both panting] [coughs] Fuck. Are you all right? Um, I'm, uh-- I'm not sure how to even answer that. Me neither. I think you're the first real person I've seen. I'm Sam. Monica. Who were those women? And-- And where is everyone? I don't know. But we're gonna have to figure this out. What's the last thing you remember? Um, I, um-- I was going into surgery, and-- and then I woke up on the operating table, surrounded by them. Same thing happened to me, but without the "them." So, we're alone? You really haven't seen anyone else? Not exactly. What's that supposed to mean? A man in a coma woke up and tried to kill me. Twice. W-- What? Look. We need to keep moving. We need to get out of here. Okay. Hey! What? Not that way. The sign says that's the way to the elevator. Yeah? Well, the homicidal coma man says otherwise. You need to trust me. We need to find a different way. Let's go. Okay. [door opens] [buttons clicking] Shit. The phones are dead. It's a zombie apocalypse, isn't it? It's not the zombie apocalypse. When I stabbed the coma man in the head, he came back to life. But not before he cleaned himself up, dressed himself again, and then reappeared in his bed as if nothing ever happened. Okay, you are not making me feel any better. So, what happens when the not-zombies come back again? We'll be long gone. Put this on in the meantime. Play doctor with you? You know what? In the past, that would've been a really good idea. Look. You get me out of here, and I will be more than happy to play in this one. Lady, as tempting as that offer sounds, I'm married, and I really want to get back to my wife. [captive] Hello? Hello! Who's that? No. No! [groans] [captive] Anybody out there? Hello? [Sam] Hello? Hello! Yes! In here! Oh, thank God. I thought I was gonna die here. What happened? The cops, t-t-the doctor, they all just left me cuffed to this bed. What did you do? Nothing! I was shot, then brought here, and I woke up just like this. It's pretty fucked up, ain't it? Who shot you? A cop. No. We are not helping him. What? N-N-No! I'm not the bad guy here, I swear! Hey! We need to stick together. I helped you, didn't I? Yeah. That's 'cause I'm not a criminal! Neither am I, lady! [coughing] Stop! Stop! [gunshots] I'm Carter. Sam. What's happening out there? Nothing good. We need to get to the lobby and then the exit. Can you move? Yeah. How do we know you're not gonna try and kill us? How do I know you're not gonna try and kill me? I saw you swipe that scalpel. Hey! Nobody's killing anyone. You're gonna need this. [groans] Fuck. Shit! You okay? Yeah, I'll live. Let's go. Come on! You better not try anything. Aw, give it a rest, lady. You're not my type. Huh. Too pretty? Nah! Too extra. Damn. [grunts] [screaming] No! [grunts] Come on! Who the hell are they? Not-zombies. [distorted screaming] Shit! We're not gonna make the elevator. Go for the stairs! Move! [not-zombies chittering] [chittering continues] It's not gonna hold! [not-zombies pounding] Go! Go! [grunts] [growls] [Carter] Let's go! [Sam] Wait! [gasps] [ominous whispering] [Sam screams] [gasping] You shouldn't be in there. [coughing] There's smoke everywhere. There's gotta be a fire somewhere. I saved you from it. [breathing heavily] My friends. We have to help them. They're not your friends. You can't go down after them. You can't go anywhere. Or else you will be lost forever. Let go of me! He said let go of him! [pants] [wrench clatters] Hey. Stay with me. [echoing] Stay with me. Stay with me, Sam. Uh-huh. Welcome back. I'm still here. Just trying to finish some work. Oh, the horror of having to share the morning commute with your wife. [chuckles] [chuckles] It's a nightmare. But I'll get over it. Maybe even before the baby arrives. Well, you better. Or else you're gonna wake up an angry old man, with long, straggly hair, crazy fingernails... I already wake up an angry old man. And I'd only be angry if you weren't there. You work too much. Deep breaths. [inhales slowly] Stay the course. [exhales slowly] Tomorrow is important. But so is today. Okay. That's it. I'm all yours. Sorry. Too late. Oh. Love you. No texting and driving. Only when I'm texting you. Not even then. Do you remember how to get back here tonight? Sure. GPS. Or you could follow the signs. It's uptown, not downtown, remember? I got it. Love you. Call me if you get lost. Uh-huh. [phone ringing] [phone beeps] Hey. [on phone] Okay, Sam... [glass shatters] I should just take him downstairs right now. Not as long as I'm here, you won't. He's a selfish, workaholic, reckless womanizer who crashed while texting and driving. You mean a good, hardworking man and future father who made some mistakes, who got hit by a drunk driver. Fine. It'll be his choice. Always. [electricity buzzing] [grunts] Oh! Fuck. [grunts] [breathes deeply] [groans] [gun clicks] Drop the wrench. [clangs] Are you one of them? One of who? Whoever the hell is trying to stop me from getting out of this place. No. Do I look like one of them? Yeah, you got a face. That's a positive. I'm assuming you're not the one who patched me up. No. It wasn't me. You're a cop. Yeah. So what the hell is going on? I don't know. I can't get a signal. Neither can I. All the lines are dead. Look, I sign every birthday card, "See you at a hundred." I'm gettin' out of this place, no matter what it takes. Hey, look! You'll get no argument from me. But the exit is in the lobby, and let me tell you, the elevator is dangerous. And there's smoke all over the stairs. I think there's a fire somewhere. [sighs] Have you looked out a window yet? What? [bell jingles] Hey, boss. Yeah, I know it's a bit of a stereotype, but I like 'em. Can I grab a coffee there, as well? Hoodie. [gun clicks] Don't move! Hands where I can see 'em! Down on your knees! I'm not gonna ask again! Now. It's not him. You got the wrong guy, dude. Maybe it's a blackout. Maybe the whole grid is down. What do you-- What do you mean, like terrorists? Or hackers. All hospitals have generators. That would explain why we still have power. Maybe they evacuated everybody before the generators kicked in. That's why the hospital's empty. Seriously? Hey! [groans] Fuck! [pills rattle] [person in wheelchair] Whoa! Slow down there, son. You're gonna open up those stitches. [wrench clatters] Unless, of course, you're here to fix my sink. What? Well, you got a pretty big wrench there. I was thinking, you know, my sink's leaking. Maybe you could, uh... No. I don't fix sinks. Are you real? [chuckles] I mean, are you really here? Of course, I'm here! Aren't you? Yes. [sighs] Thank God. People keep disappearing on me. Well, I'm not going anywhere, son. Name's Virgil. Sam. Sam, huh? Why are you still here, Sam? I'm trying to leave. I need to find my wife. She's pregnant. But I keep getting attacked. Yeah. Well, you were bleeding pretty badly there. Yeah, the, uh, the wrench lady took you to that room over there, and wanted to move you downstairs, but, uh... [laughs] ...I wouldn't let her. She's the one who saved me? She's the one who stitched you up. And apparently, uh, let you borrow her wrench. So where is she now? We need to get out of here. I think there's a fire, or a blackout, or worse. Worse? Well, power's still on. Water's still running. We're both still breathin'. I'd say we're doing okay. Virgil, I looked out the window. There's only darkness. And it's light in here. In a couple of hours, the sun will come up. It'll be light out there, too. Assuming we survive the night. I can't explain this, but there are dangerous things here, and they mean to do us harm. I know. I've seen them. You have? Yeah. [sighs] I thought I was going crazy. Monica, one of the other patients, she thought it even might be the apocalypse. The apocalypse? [chuckles] I don't think that's what's going on. No one can get a phone signal. Well, these old buildings wreak havoc with reception. But I'll tell you what, the higher up you go, the better chance you have. What about the roof? Now, that makes sense. Go up on the roof, get a signal, find out what's going on, and... talk to your wife. [gunshots] Virgil, we're getting outta here. There you are. Glad to see you on your feet again. You helped me. Thank you. [electricity crackles] Thank me later. Did you just hear those gunshots? Yeah. There's a cop. He said he'd do anything it takes to get out of here alive. I like him already. Let's follow his lead. Can I have my wrench back? Yes, ma'am. It's Doctor. Or Lily. But not "Lilith." I hate that name. Whatever you say, Doctor. [screaming] [screaming] [Virgil] No, shooting first and asking questions later is not what we need right now. [Sam] The cop did seem a little off. Really? We've been abandoned, the phones are dead, and there are crazy monster-people trying to kill us. I'm "off" too. We all are. I woke up from a nap in the break room, and everyone was gone, except for Virgil. And then I saw you getting attacked by a faceless orderly. Me and two patients... we tried the stairs. They were filled with smoke. The orderly pulled me out. Then let's hope the elevator still works. We want to go up to the roof, especially if there's a fire. Fire or no fire, we need to go down. Find the exit. Find everyone else. [gasps] The orderly's back. And he's found his face again. He looks in pretty good shape for getting a wrench to the head. Yeah. Perhaps you should try talking to him before bashing him in the head again, hmm? Talk to the man with the vanishing mouth? She's right. That didn't work so well the last time. [Virgil] Oh, was that before or after he pulled you from the smoking stairwell? Touché. You stay here. If he tries anything, bash him. Hello? My friends and I would like to leave now. [electricity crackling] [glass shatters] [gasping] Help me! Wait! What happened? Did you see the girl? What girl? [breathing heavily] [coughs] Come on. You shouldn't be here. We're leaving now. You shouldn't be with her. You shouldn't be with her! [Sam gasps, choking] This conversation is over. [Lily grunts] Going downstairs is a mistake that you will regret! [growling] Let him go! [orderly grunts] [Sam gasps] [roaring] Get up to the roof! Get help! [roars] No! [Lily grunting] Come on. We can't leave him! Crap. Virgil! Virgil? Virgil! Sam! [shouts] Lily. I'm sorry. We have to go. Ready? [Lily gasps] Let's go! [button clicking] We're supposed to go to the roof. That doesn't make any sense. We need to get out of here. [orderly roaring] [Sam groaning] [Sam grunts] [orderly growls] No! Let me go! Help! Lily! Sam! Lily! Fuck! [panting] [groans] [elevator whirring] [ceiling bangs] [banging continues] [shouts] [gasping] [breathing heavily] [Sam] I promise you, I didn't call her. You fucked up once. Don't do it again. I'm sorry. Temptation is your weakness. Was my weakness. Look, I'm a different guy now. [sighs] I'm different now. I changed. You made me a better person. I know who I married, but it doesn't always have to be about you, what you want, what you need. I know. Look. I'm selfish. You don't have to be. Look. [sighs] I'm sorry. I get lost. I get distracted. I get tempted. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. But I don't want to lose you. I'm right here. I know. Our future child is right here. I know. You're always trying to help yourself. When are you gonna try and help someone else? I'm sorry. [sobs] [electricity crackles] [Monica] Who's chasing you? [gasps] [sighs] A ten-foot orderly with no fuckin' face. Oh. So nothing crazy. I thought I'd lost you. You did. We're all lost. There's no way out, Sam. We looked and looked. Carter left me and he's still looking. But there's no exit anywhere. Now you listen to me. You don't give up. There's always a way out. We just have to find the lobby. This is the lobby. Oh, shit. [door opens] [Monica] Sam! [Sam] What's going on? Someone's coming! Shh. [elevator rumbling] [elevator bell dings] [muffled screams] Faceless, and now headless. You got away. He stuck his head where it shouldn't be. The elevator doors did the rest. I told you they weren't safe. Who's your friend? Dr. Lily, Monica. Monica, this is Dr. Lily. I'm the one he was playing doctor with before he met you. We're not playing. [cop shouting] [window thudding] Son of a bitch! Hey! [shouts] This is the lobby, isn't it? So where are the main doors? [gunshot] What the... Well, at least we know the air outside is real. Just checked the whole floor. No exit doors anywhere. You okay? Thankfully. Hey! You're the son of a bitch who shot me! I knew it! I didn't shoot you, you profiling asshole! Hey! You shot me! Whoa. Take it easy. Hey! Put the gun down. Your partner may have pulled the trigger, but that's the same in the eyes of the law. My partner? He was not my partner! You just assume every Black dude in a goddamn hoodie is a fucking criminal! What, now you're the victim? Give me the fucking money! Now! [cashier] Whoa, whoa! [thief] Hurry up. Move, and you die. [bell jingles] Can I grab a coffee there as well? Hoodie. Don't move! Hands where I can see 'em! No, no... Now! It's not him. Now! You got the wrong guy, dude. Put your hands behind your head. Get down on your fucking knees. [customer] Look out! [groans] I'm sorry. [gasps] [groaning] [bell jingles] He's getting away! [cop shouts] Stop! [gunshot echoes] Yeah, well, no shit. And so was the innocent lady standing next to me. Hey! Nobody is killing anybody. We're on the same side. No, no. We're far from that. The Internet is down. All the landlines are dead. There's no cell-phone signal, and none of us have found a door to get outta here, and there's fucking creatures trying to kill us! So I'd say you, me and him-- we're on the same side. This is impossible. Hey. You're a cop. You're a logical guy. If what we're seeing is impossible, maybe we're not seeing it right. Lily. What did you give me upstairs? Antibiotics, adrenaline. You needed them. The pills are for the pain. I saw some empty vials when I woke up. Maybe we were all drugged? Was I drugged, too, in this scenario? Maybe. You told me you woke up from a long nap in the break room. Anything could have happened. And now we're all having the same hallucinogenic nightmare? Or maybe one of us is having a hallucinogenic nightmare and the rest of us are just figments of his or her imagination. Or maybe we're all already dead. Oh, come on. That's bullshit. How can you be so sure? Because you're still breathing... and bleeding. None of us are dead. But this will not end well unless we work together. I still don't trust him. He was handcuffed for a reason! Yeah, 'cause he's a criminal. Yeah, that's exactly what we need, another racist pig with a fucking gun! What did you do? Hey! He is the reason that I'm here. He doesn't get to leave, but I do. [Monica] You killed him? Yeah! I killed him! 'Cause he's a criminal, and he'd have killed us if he had the chance! Okay? I'm not dying here. Not today. You. You work here, right? How did you get in if there's no doors? Through a door, asshole. Then take us to it. Now! Let's go. [Sam] Calm the fuck down. Let's go. I came in through the employee parking garage. Basement level. Elevator or stairs? I took the elevator straight up to my floor. All right, assuming there is one, why didn't you come through the main entrance? Because I have a car. She knows something she's not telling. Like, why this lobby has no doors. I was only filling in today. First time at this hospital. All right, basement it is. Wait. Where's the head? It was lying right here! [elevator bell dings] It was here. [cop shouting] [Monica] Oh, shit! Monica! Sam! Sam! Stay with me. We can't leave her. I'm sorry, Lily. Monica! Hey, Mon-- Monica! Hey. You okay? This must be hell. [cries] No, it's not. This is a hospital. There's no way out of here. Yes, there is. Monica, look at me. You have to trust Dr. Lily. She knows a way out. [sobbing] What the fuck is happening? Look, maybe-- maybe Carter was right. Look, maybe we were drugged. But the longer we stay here, the worse it's gonna get for us. We have to reach the outside. We can get out through the basement garage. The way I came in. I promise. How? You know what's waiting for us in those stairs. And we can't go back to that elevator. No. Not that elevator. I know another one. Come on. How'd you know this was here? [Sam] I've been here before. When I first woke up. It didn't go well. You said we couldn't use this one because of a homicidal coma man. Yeah, well, we have to. Let's hope the homicidal coma man doesn't try to stop us. Get ready. [elevator bell dings] Coma man? Yeah. You know, too many of those pills can cause hallucinations. How many did you take? Not enough for this place. Excuse me. [elevator rumbling] [elevator bell dings] So where's this parking garage, Doctor? It should be down this hall. Guys? The morgue. [chuckles] Fitting, since we're all probably dead. Hey, Monica. [Lily] We need to keep moving. None of these people made it out. Unfortunately, not everyone gets to choose how they leave a hospital. I got to choose. To be here, I mean. I even paid a lot of money to do it. For the chance to look... perfect. Monica, what are you doing? I came in for breast enhancement. But there's no incisions. No scars. No nothing. Maybe what happened happened before you had the surgery. [chuckles] Maybe. But they've never looked this good. Hey, guys, I got a dial tone. Hello? 911? [operator] 911. What's your emergency? [Sam sighs] Thank God. Um, we're stuck in a hospital. It's an abandoned hospital. Somewhere in the city. We're in the basement morgue. We're trying to find the exit. I can't hear you, sir. Can you give me an address? Hello? Hello! Hello? Can you hear me? We're in a fuckin' hospital. Where, sir? I-I don't know where it is. It's downtown. Um, somewhere in the city. Trace the call! [garbled chattering] Hello! Hel-- Fuck. Sam? [gasps] [gun clicks] Whatever attacked me in that elevator is dead. Okay? Th-Th-- They're all dead. But we're not. Yet. [breathing shakily] Ain't that right, Doctor? Huh? Especially since my gunshot wound is no longer there. [Lily] I wouldn't get too excited. Looks like you still have plenty of injuries to worry about. [cop] Yeah, maybe. But, like I asked you before, take me to the exit. Now. This better be the way. It is. She's been trying to get me out of here since I first met her. Oh, yeah? Then why are you still here? That's why. I know of only one way out, and there it is. Well, you guys do what you want. I'm going down there. See you at a hundred. I'm with him! What about the fire? [Monica] I'm more scared of staying here. [Lily] This is the way I came. I know my way back. Trust me, Sam. [Sam] You sure we can make it? If we stick together. There's got to be another way. There's gotta be another exit. We can make it, Sam. Fuck. Okay, let's go. [voices murmuring] [screams] No. No! [both grunting, groaning] [gunshot] [grunts] [screams] [gunshot] No! [whimpers] [panting] I told you. I am getting out of here. No matter what it takes! [cop screams] [Monica gasps] [Lily gasps] [elevator whirring] [Monica] Guys! The elevator! [breathing heavily] Carter's body is gone again. [gasps] Now's our chance, while that thing is occupied. Did you not just see what happened? [whimpers, sobs] [Sam] Monica! Go for the stairs! Leave her. You and I can get out together. I can't do that. We need to go for the stairs. Come on. No. The exit. You're one of them. No. You're one of them. And there's only one way out. Make that two ways. Virgil. Monica! Look at me. We gotta go, baby. Come on. [sobbing] Go for the stairs. I'm so sorry, Sam. Don't be sorry. For all of it. [air thuds] Monica! [screaming] Monica. Sam. You. I trusted you. [growling] Fuck. Monica was right. This is hell. No. It isn't hell or heaven or anywhere in between. [cries] What is it then? It's just a hospital. [sobbing] But some have been here a lot longer than others. They just don't want to leave. [sobs] I'm not one of those people. That's good to hear, Sam. You chose to get out of your bed. You chose to leave this-- this floor. What else are you gonna choose to do next? I just want to get out of this place. [grunts] No. What? I'm going home. [grunting] [metal grinding] We're in the same place. Fuck! Well, at least the orderly's gone. I really need to talk to my wife. Now, there's an elevator on each side of this hospital, but if we want to get to the roof, we need to get to the other one. Right. [grunts] Let's get the fuck out of here. [baby crying in distance] [Sam panting] [crying continues] Do you hear that? Yes, I do. [crying continues] [gasps] [crying stops] Sarah? It's a girl. She's perfect. How's your head? It's okay. I've been trying to get to you from the moment I woke up. I've never left. Remember, deep breaths. Stay the course. How do I get out of here? Follow the signs. Or use your GPS. Doesn't work in here. Then go to where it does. Sarah? Why are you in this hospital, Virgil? [chuckles] I'm old. Why are you? Car crash. I'm dead, aren't I? I assure you, you are not. Neither is anyone else here, at least not when you first saw them. But being alive is not the same as living. But if I die in here, then I really die? Quite the opposite. If you die here, you become even more disoriented as you lash out at everyone and everything. And, therefore, you're stuck here even longer. [monitor beeping] [shouts] [EKG flatlining] Who are you, Virgil? I'm just a guide trying to get you where you want to be. And Dr. Lily? She's a guide too, albeit one with a different purpose. [sirens wailing] Hey. Hey. I'm gonna get you out of here. Let's try to get you out of here. The other guy was drinking. Dead now. Don't listen to her. Just look at me. Give me your hand. There you go. [Monica] Anything to look beautiful, right? [nurse] You already look... ...beautiful. [chuckles] You hear that, Doc? He's gonna put you out of business. [doctor] Oh, I'm going to make you... ...even more beautiful. [Monica] Oh, you better. Are you ready? Mm-hmm. All right. Just relax and look up into the light. He'll stop flashing that in your face any moment now. The light is very annoying. That's a bit bright. Yeah, I know. It's a bit of a stereotype, but I like 'em. Can I grab a coffee there, as well? Hoodie. Don't move! Hands where I can see 'em! Put your hands behind your head. Down on your knees. Not him. You got the wrong guy, man. [gunshots] He's getting away! [door bell jingles] [gunshot] It's not him. Are you okay? [exhales slowly] Let's get to the roof. That's not good. But I think I can take her. [Virgil] An injured little girl in a hospital? [Sam] She's a lot more than that and you know it. [Virgil] Yeah, she is. Maybe you should try talking to her. You know, the last time you suggested that, it didn't work out so well. The last time I said that, you were listening to someone else. She's all that stands in our way? Exactly. Good. Hey there. Help me. I want to. I don't like it here. Me neither. Are you lost? Yes, but I don't want to go with the bad lady. [whispers] No. Sam is heading up to the roof so we can call for help. Do you want to come with us? Come on. Well, I would suggest the stairs, but... [chuckles] [whispers] We're gonna take the elevator, okay? Good girl. [elevator bell dings] [elevator whirring] [whirring stops] [ceiling creaking] [grunts] [both grunting] [panting] Get her to the stairs. Now. Hey, baby. Don't be scared. When I count to three, I want you to run as fast as you can, okay? One, two, three! Run! Go with her. What about you? [shouts] [screams] [announcement on PA] [grunts] [shouts] You should be in bed. [echoing] I love you. Don't get lost. Comatose. Brain-dead. Life support. There is no up or down. You must stay in bed. [gasps] [echoing] Code red. [defibrillator hums] [nurse] Clear. [bulb explodes] [gasps] [monitor beeping rapidly] [gasps] [monitor beeping steadily] I'm the coma man. [sobbing] You should be in bed. [Virgil] Let him go! [screams] Ah, I thought we might need to fix a sink. [chuckles] Virgil. How long have I been here? Oh, well, that's up to you. The faceless ones want you to stay. "Life at any cost." I have a choice? Always. Now make it, and get out of here. What about you? Well, I still have some more guiding to do. Carter? Among others. Good luck, Sam. Thank you, Virgil. [breathing heavily] [child] Hey, mister. Please help me. Come with me. I can't do it. We can do this together. Come on. Go. [coughing] Freedom from this place is downstairs. I promise you. Lilith? Your wife, your work, your future child have been taken from you. That fear you feel, rage against it. Rage with me. Let go. Monica chose it. [EKG flatlining] The cop chose it. And now you will choose it. I choose the roof. You shouldn't be with her! [screams] [grunting] Come on. [shouts] Come on. Let's go. Thank you. [Sam] Let's go. [monitor beeps] [sobs] [gasps] We're going to be okay, baby. I love you. [chuckles] [typing] [sighs] I love you, too. [phone chimes]
