Mayor McHenry currently faces 12 counts of corruption for his alleged embezzlement of county funds and could face a maximum of 12 years in state prison. I guess now we know who to blame for all those unfilled potholes around town. Well, maybe they'll fill up with snowflakes tonight, right, Stan? That's right, Todd. An Alberta clipper system, a fast moving area of low pressure is dragging a cold front our way, it's drawing moisture up from the south. We're expecting between three and six inches worth of heavy, wet snow by the time you wake up for Christmas morning. Christmas is... a happy time. Yep, a real happy time. I'm just saying, Christmas ain't like it is in those feel good movies. Sometimes it could be like, like... Ho, ho, ho. Like a cosmic kick in the dick. When I was 11, the local county judge had a pretty shitty Christmas. It was all over the news. The judge comes home late on Christmas Eve and there was a hit man waiting for him in the kitchen. Could have been worse, I mean, he lived. That kind of stuff happens all the time in East Jesus, Ohio. We're just a scoot south of bumblefuck Michigan on the border of Pensyltucky. Right square in a county called trouble. Some pretty messed up shit goes on here, on a daily, like, for reals. For real? Sorry. That'll be all? It'll be $10.99. Would you like a bag with that? Do you have a bathroom? Dear God... I know I don't pray much ever, at all, but if you really do exist, if you really are this all powerful, all knowing being, then please, just this once... help me. Please, please, please, please, please, please. Please, please... please. Oh. Sophia! Me-a Sophia, you stole my heart and then I sharded. - Sophia! - Oh, my God. What's you doing? Walking, what does it look like? It looks like you could use a lift. You could use a car. Well, I got my driver's permit last week and I've been delivering papers, so... my uncle's Sunfire will be mine in no time. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. By then I bet you could use a ride but I might be too busy. I thought you were in love with me? Now you're going to be too busy. I was in love in you, that was last year. Plus, I heard you're with Trey Davis now. We broke up. Kind of. - I figured. - What's that suppose to mean? Well, when I was coming here, I passed Madison Fatchek's house and as soon as her dad leaves, I see him walk in. Fatchick, Fatchek? She's not so fat anymore. I heard she got her stomach stapled. Jimmy Stam says that she's anorexic. She's probably bulimic. Those titties, still fat though. You're so gross! Just saying. Isn't her dad a cop? He's a detective and Jimmy Stam told me that she helps her cousin sell weed and he doesn't detect shit. That must be where Trey's been getting faded. He's probably getting more than just weed. - Stop. - What? Your shoe's untied. The stupid thing keeps coming undone. You should double knot it.

Noah. Noah! Why don't you cook dinner for once? Because I don't want to. Why don't you get off my nutsack? You are such a prick. - You want me to turn off the power again? - Woman, please. How many times we have to go through this, Rayjon? We need to save money, get that through your freaking skull. Yeah, and how much that outfit cost at Penny's yesterday? - I got that for work. - Sure you did. You really think it cost more than those golf clubs you got out in the garage? Again with the golf clubs. What'd you think, you were Tiger Woods or something? You're going to sell those things tomorrow, you hear me? No, I ain't. If you don't then I will. Go to work, Theresa.

Eat a dick, eat a dick, take a big old bite, or a little lick. I should record that right there. We've all had a shitty Christmas at one time or another, right? Like, when I was four years old my dumbass daddy robbed a Quick Mart twice. Ask my mom about that Christmas, and all she'll say is, "He didn't get me nothing that year." Why are you bitching at me? Because you didn't get me nothing for Christmas this year, you cheap son of a bitch. - Wait, what time is it? - It's 11:53. Well, it ain't Christmas morning yet. Where you going? The night is young, Theresa. The night is not young, it's Christmas freaking Eve. You can't get nothing now, every where's closed. We'll see about that. - Nefantarter, holy shit, is that you? - Yeah.

You ain't noticed? Two... two years, it's been that long, holy shit, man, I remember when you were everyday, twice a day. Yeah, not anymore. Hey, hey, didn't you go to jail or some shit for leaving your kid in the car while you were getting a handy at the Rub & Tug? Yeah, I was all doped out on that crystal blue shit back then. Oh, yeah, crystal blue. I got that crystal blue shit, man. Not anymore. I know what you like, mama, you like that white chocolate. - $1.87. - $1.87? - Yes. - Uh, that's a bit steep, ain't it? - Tax. - Yeah, yeah, tax my ass. Shit, I forgot my wallet. I'll tell you what, you pay me. - What? - You pay me. Come on, open the register. Open the register. Next time you should, uh, catch it with your hands, not your face. Come on, come on, underneath too. Holy Christmas tits! Is this for me? Be a good little elf and put it all in Santa's sack. Uh-uh. Hey, uh, sorry about your eye. My daddy took all that money, and put it straight in his arm. Oh, shit. Ah. I forgot the goddamn candy. And I tell him, don't you ever come back here, or I'll kick your shitty little ass, punk. I forgot my candy bar, but since I'm here, why don't you do me a favor and give me your wallet? Please, sir, you've already robbed us once. No, I already robbed him. Damn. I'm sorry, none of you guys can catch, that's too bad. Merry Christmas, fellas. Oh, oh, there it is, oh, oh. You cheap son of a bitch. Theresa. You didn't get me nothing for Christmas this year. Uh, that's not true. I, I got you your favorite candy bar. Eat it, Daddy. I want candy. Oh. Oh! - What kind are you going to get? - Peanut butter. I'm going to get caramel. You should try the white chocolate. Mm. It's delicious.

Yay! What? - Sophia. - Go away! Is everything all right, sweetie? You have to work on Christmas Eve? Yeah, we're doing inventory today. I could use the extra hours. I'll be home by 11, don't worry. Just makes sure dickhead downstairs cooks something for dinner. - Did you hear me? - Yes! You don't mind if I borrow these, do you? I'll give them back, I swear. What's the matter, is it Trey? What did he do now? Mind your own business. I was a teenager once too, you know? Until I got pregnant. Anyways, been there done that. I'm always here if you need to talk. - Mom. - Oh, no, I can't right now, honey, I got to go. Do me a favor though, stop by and see your grandparents today. - Do I have to? - Yes, you have to. - Why? - Because they're old, and they live, like, five blocks away and they're probably going to die soon. - And because I said so. - Whatever! You don't think Grandma could use the extra help. Malecia was supposed to come over. So go later, they'd love to see you. Fine, I'll go but it's total bullshit. - Sophia Hendrix, so help me, God. - That is not my name. Girl, sometimes I swear you act like a spoiled little twat. If you want to keep your daddy's last name and be known as the daughter as an OD'd smack addict, go ahead but don't come crying to me again when they start bullying you in school. Great, now I'm really going to be late. Can I use this? I love you, sweetie. Hey, I remember you, you live on Easy Street, right? Your mama like jewelry? She got any diamonds? Hey, where the hoe, hoe, hoes at? How about I take you home with me tonight? Could be my elf on the shelf. No, thanks. You ain't even my type. Okay, everybody, let's take a little break.

Hi, Mr. Hendricks, is Sophia home? Yeah, she upstairs. Hi, Malecia. Oh, what now, sucker? Wait, that's not fair. Who is it? It's me, open up. Thank you so much for coming over. Anything for my BFF. Oh, God, your stepbrother is such a freak. Why, what'd he do now? Notta, boy's just whack. You have no idea, he sits down there playing games all day because he has, like, zero friends. What about the little boy from down the street, uh... Franki, what's his face? Oh, RJ kicked the crap out of him, so now Mrs. Baylaw won't let him come over anymore. The boy's, like, ten years old. - Yep. - With asthma. RJ gets picked on by all the kids in his own grade, so he pays that forward by bullying anyone weaker than him. Freakshow. In other news, so what's up with Sophia? I'm pregnant. Shut up, are you serious? Oh, that's wild, do you know who's it is? Of course I know who's it is, it's Trey's! - Oh. - What? - Nothing. - No, tell me, what? It's like I heard he was with Fatchick now. No, he just gets weed off of her. That's not what I heard. Can we focus on the problem here? - What's that? - The baby, Malecia, the baby! - Oh, gee, relax. - Relax? I cannot relax. My mom is going to kill me. My whole life is over! I'm going to have to drop out of school. I'm going to have to get, like, a job for diapers. No, you won't, that's what welfare's for. What? I'm going to get so fat! Well, look at the bright side, if Trey's into Madison Fatchek, maybe he likes a little extra cushion for the pushing. Ow, sorry. He's not with Fatchek. Besides, heard she lost, like, a lot of weight or something. Oh, I have an idea. - Well, spit it out. - Girl, that's what you should have done. Ow, sorry. You could get an abortion. You mean, like, kill it? You can't kill something that's not been born yet, can you? I mean, I guess not. Is that even legal? Of course it's legal, it's been legal since, like, the '80's. Haven't you ever heard of a woman's right to choose? I thought it was choosing the name or something. No, dummy, that means you can choose to keep it or... - So my mom would never know? - Nope. Nobody ever has to know. Here, let's search it. Ohio abortions... got it. Well, what's it say? Uh... A parent must consent before a minor gets an abortion. My life is so over. Want to go get pizza? Go grab me another six pack out the fridge. - Can I get one? - Yeah, no. - Where you all going? - Out. You got to babysit the boys next door. - Uh, no one told me that. - Yeah, the neighbor lady came over this morning, asked if you could watch them while she do some last minute Christmas shopping. - So I told her, all right. - Well, I can't. Your mom going to be heated when she find out. - You know we need that scrilla. - Sorry, not sorry. Malecia! I can babysit. You? - So when did it happen? - What? Oh, oh! - Oh, yeah. - On Thanksgiving. Get out, he stuffed you up on turkey day? Was it at his house or yours? He actually got in a huge fight with his parents that night, had nowhere to go to eat so I invited him over to join us. Oh, you're too sweet. It actually happened in his car. Next thing I knew we were just doing it. How'd you get pregnant? Uh, last time I checked there's only one way to get pregnant. - Didn't he use a condom? - Yeah, at first. Then it kept getting... - soft. - The condom? No, him! So he had to take it off. Oh. - Sophia! - Oh, no. I waited for my period, it just never came. - No way! - What! It's my mom, she says someone broke into the house. - Really? - Sorry, bae, got to go. Stay strong, girl, you'll figure it out. Hundo p. Oh, hell no, they took our presents. Sophia, won't you ride with me-a? Are you stalking me? You wish I was stalking you. So you're not stalking me? No, I'm, uh, I'm on my way to Walmart. - Oh, really? - Yeah. - Walmart's that way. - Oh, I mean, uh, I mean, I'm coming back from Walmart. Oh. What'd you get? I, uh, I shoplifted this gum, you want a piece? - You stole this? - Maybe, would that turn you on? I mean, that's why you're with Trey, right, you like criminals. No. Huh. I just figured it probably made you wet every time he talks about juvie. Ew. He's 18 now, so no more juvie. You know that's so statutory right? - Shut up! - I'm just saying. - So why him? - Why not? Because he's a complete tool. - You're a tool! - Good one. Why do you think he's a tool? Where do I even start? Jimmy Stam told me his real name is Edward Davis III. He just calls himself Trey to sound black. He acts like he's all hood and gangster, he's country as shit. His dad's the fishing warden, real hood. And plus isn't he supposed to be a senior? He's failed three years in a row. He's a liar, he's an asshole and he's a scumbag. I bet he's cheating on you right now. People like him need to be put in their place. Okay, psycho, let's go. - Where are we going? - Madison Fatchek's house. - Okey dokey, pretty lady. - You're such a dork. Oh, look at these losers. Isn't that Trey's little slut? Hey, watch this. Fags! Assholes. I think those were Trey's friends. - That's his whip, right? - Yeah. He probably stole it. I told you so. He's just smoking some weed, it isn't even that big of a deal. Oh, snap! - Busted. - Oh. Seriously? Let's go! Sophia, it's not what it looks like! You lied to me! I'm sorry, shawty, my head's all messed up, I don't even know what's going on. Let that bitch go, Trey. Who you calling a bitch, skank? Tell her you're with a real woman now. Shut up, skank. Sophia. Okay, hoe, you gots to go. I'm about to pop you like a cherry on prom night. Whoa! Damn! Oh. - Are you getting that? - Yep. Oh, man. - All right. - Hell yeah! Are you going to help me up or what? Hey, give me my shirt back. Sophia, wait! What are you looking at? This one's going on YouTube! - You okay? - No. Well, look, my offer still stands, nothing's better for a heartache than a horror movie, a bottle of 151 and some Sprite to chase it down. There's actually this flick called, Silent Night, Deadly Night - about a deranged... - I can't. Well, if Santa's not your thing, there's always Killer Klowns from Outer Space. No, I can't come over. Don't tell me it's because of Trey, he's cheating on you, you saw it with your own eyes. There's two types of men in this world, and he's neither of them. You're smart, you're fun, you're beautiful, you're perfect. Stop. What? I'm... Let me guess, you're still in love with him? I give up. Noah. I'm pregnant! With his? I guess I was wrong about you, Sophia, you're not as smart as I thought. Good luck. - What? - You're going to need it. He spit on us! What's wrong with you? Hey. You all right? You need to talk? Is this about that white boy that thinks of himself as a brother? You just let me know, I've been waiting months to slap the black out of his mouth. Or if it's a womanly issue, your mom won't be back for awhile, but you can always go to your Grandma's. - Just go away! - Okay. I'm just trying to help, God. How long you going to be in there? I got to take a shit! - Get off my porch. - Grandpa. - I will shoot. - Grandpa, it's me, Sophia. - Who? - Your granddaughter! Oh, yeah. - Come on in, sweetie pie. - Okay. Go on, take a seat, sit down. What happened to your eye? - What's that? - Your eye, what happened? That ain't nothing, I'm fine. I'm sorry, where are my manners, would you like something to drink some milk or pop? No, thanks. - You want to cookie? - No, I'm good. Well, suit yourself. Where's Grandma at? We just don't want any trouble here, ma'am. - You worthless piece of garbage! - Hey! - Ow! - Settle down. Okay, that was against the law. Oh, who gives a shit. I was just hoping to talk to her. Why, you have a bad day at school? Oh, there's no school today, it's Christmas Eve. Oh, yeah. I knew that. Can I ask you a question, Grandpa? Shoot, kiddo. Why did you and Grandma stop after Mom came along? Like, why didn't you guys have any more kids? - We did. - What? Your mama... she was actually our second child. She's got an older sister out there somewhere. What? You know what, your grandma would fry my balls for breakfast if she knew I was going to tell you this, but guess what, kiddy... want you get to my age you start passing secrets like you pass gas. Oh, Grandpa. It's milk. So what happened to her? - Who's that? - Mom's sister. You know that story about how me and your Grandma met, don't you? Yeah, at a Cleveland Indians game, right? We didn't meet at no Indians game, that was just a, just a bunch of hog wash your grandma told everyone. Christ, we, we met at a church. You and Grandma went to church? Hell yes, we went in to church. That was damn near 50 years ago. You see your grandma was real religious back then. I attended on a regular basis, though I wasn't much for the singing and dancing till I met her. From that moment on there was no getting between us. Good Lord! Oh, my God, oh, oh, oh, my God, oh, oh, amen, oh, amen, oh, my God! Long story short... I put a bun in her over. And after a few months, that baby girl was upon us. So we put her up for adoption. Why? Well, I didn't have a job, we had no way to support her and it's... sometimes life only gives you one choice in the moment. I always hoped that she had a good life, she, she found a good family that loved her and took care of her. Anyway, Grandma and me, we moved on. After a few years, I got a job at the mill. We built a house and we started trying again. That's when your mama came along and believe me, with all the spit and vinegar in her veins, one was enough. Wow. Yeah. Funny thing is we, we ain't never been back to church since. So I bought myself a wedding coat and I met her at the courthouse. - And that was that. - Yeah. And that, sweetie pie, was that. Son of a bitch, what time is it? Uh, it's a quarter past eight. Yeah, I forgot to take my cholesterol pills. Are you sure I can't get you something to eat? No, thanks, Grandpa, I haven't had much of an appetite today anyway. Plus, I got to get going. Bye, Grandpa. Hey, tell Grandma I said hi. Okay. Bye!

They said he took hundreds of thousands of dollars from the road department. Yeah, those same busted ass roads you're probably driving on right now with the three foot craters in them.

For more we go to Guy Sanders live on location. Guy, what can you tell us? Well, Todd, state highway patrol are now investigating what seems to be a grizzly hit and run which occurred sometime before 10:46 p.m. When a man in a red pickup truck came to this drive through to get something to eat. When I looked out I couldn't believe my eyes. It was a bloody mess down there. There was blood everywhere and an arm sticking out. There was a body under that truck. That's when the suspect left the scene as well as the victim on the side of the road. It was ridiculous. I think he gave me the thumbs up. Vicki and Todd back to you. Me, oh, my, that is just... bizarre. - Yeah. - You know? Todd, that's the perfect word to encapsulate how I feel about that... bizarre story. - Thank you, Guy. - Gruesome.
