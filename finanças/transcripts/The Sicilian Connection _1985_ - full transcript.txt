I don't want to worry, understand? In Palermo you get hit in the face with a pizza like this. Son of a bitch, That's free. - Don't like it. - It's shit. - What about the wine? - You call this wine? What do you think about the place? Good. It's a good place to breed cockroaches. You're not satisfied, don't pay. And accept our apologies, please,. I heard you were temperamental, but I like you, you've got style... - How long since you left Palermo? - Ten years. And six months. Do you go back sometimes? - Rarely. - I live there... I have a place here as well, I like to come and go. But it's my fault for ordering pizza in New York... It's like trying to find stuffed eggplant and cazzilli in New York. - I bet you don't even remember them. - Who can forget cazzilli. And sfincione, and sardine rolls, I used to eat them fresh out the sea. - From Turi. - You know him? Turi doesn't make sardine rolls anymore. Cooking is an art and no offense but you make the worst pizza in New York... Worse than O Sole Mio, that joint on 53rd street... Or Vincenzino, in the Village, or Pasquale's, that place near the Chinese... That joint where they deal drugs, like you. The cops found their stash... But they won't find anything here, you're smart, you don't keep it here... Who do you think I am? A cop? Well, Mario Vialone, am I cop or a friend? I don't like guessing games. I told Jimmy Galento, he can't let someone like you rot in here... Doesn't it make you angry watching the years go by and nothing changes? You're like a volcano that's about to erupt... But you didn't run away from Palermo to work in this hole. - Well, who am I? - You're not a cop. There's a new Inspector between here and Palermo... - You know his name? - Yes. Armando Ognibene. - We have a serious problem in Palermo. - What is it? We need to get rid of someone important, someone who could destroy the organisation... And he could have our friends in Palermo arrested, and our friends here. He's someone who knows too much, and you know what will happen? Our clients will go elsewhere, to Columbia or Bolivia, where we're not as strong. I asked Jimmy Galento to send someone from here to Palermo... And he said the right man to send was a certain lmpellitteri. - You know this lmpellitteri? - Why ask if you already know? - What's your opinion of him? - He's getting old, he doesn't see too well... He spends most of his time in strip joints, but he's Jimmy Galento's man... So it's the same old story, keep it in the family! Like in the newspapers, mothers crying... - The big meals, the usual idiot who sings. - The burps, the bicarbonate... You know lmpellitteri used to be number one... You could have taken his place if you hadn't messed up in Baltimore. I didn't mess up in Baltimore. - You left a dangerous witness alive. - A blind old lady. - lmpellitteri says she wasn't blind. - He wanted to play me and he succeeded. I want you in Palermo. I don't want lmpellitteri. You know they tried to kill him once because of some woman. - I heard. - I'm telling you I don't want lmpellitteri. But how am I going to persuade Jimmy Galento? - When are you meeting Jimmy? - Tomorrow, at five. - I'm back. - Uncle Carmelo! My little girl, you've lost weight. You're still beautiful. Open your mouth. Stick out your tongue. Hurt yourself. Harder... Harder! - Hello? - It's Mario, I want to speak to Connie. Hello, Mario. Your father can't bear to hear my voice. - Have you spoken to the lawyer? - Yes, there won't be any problems... I just want to tell you that I have to leave for a while... And I want to see you. Why don't you come here? It's still your home, isn't it? And before breaking up a marriage... - No, I don't think so... - Christ! I just want to talk! We can start over, something's come up that could be good for both of us... - Financially, as well. - It's not that. It's that as well. Be honest, money does help! - It's not that. - Then what is it? That car salesman from New Jersey with his big house? Okay, you want to talk, let's talk! - Will you answer me? - I'll talk to you when you get back. - I want to discuss it now! - I can't now, and don't shout. - Get a taxi and come here! - And don't boss me around! Bitch! What have they got you thinking? That I'm a failure, I'm not educated, and I can't speak American! I'll show you! You and all the rest of them! Leaving like that! You'll see! - What's going on? - Hi, Sabrina. - Who were you arguing with? - Nothing, I'm upset with myself. - You need something? - I looked everywhere for it... And in the end I found it. It's a gift. A great excuse to come to your place, right? - What the hell is it? - Stevie Wonder, you liked it. - Not now, I'm busy. - Then later tonight? No, tomorrow. Take care. - Hello? - It's Ognibene... - You won't believe it... - Go on. They killed lmpellitteri in one of those strip joints... They don't know who it was, but they sure had guts... I told Galento that lmpellitteri had enemies. What did Galento say? We've decided to send you back to Palermo to see your family... Pack your suitcase because you're leaving in the morning... I'll send over the ticket, I'll see you in Palermo in a few days... Take care, Mario. - You're in good shape. - Thanks, let's talk about Palermo. You should find a different way to convince that person in Palermo... - Try giving him some money. - We're trying, but it won't be easy. The less people get killed, the better it is... The newspapers talk, the TV talks... Can't you get this fanatic to change his mind? You know Masseri is trying, but like you say, he's a fanatic. This guy has got the families in Palermo fighting each other. Bunch of fools! Being played like this! That's why Auricchio and Torrisi are at war with us... Meanwhile, he's digging a grave for everyone. We must intervene, before it's too late. If the families don't do something we'll all be ruined. Talk to Masseri when you get to Palermo, and decide what to do... If it's necessary, then do it, but you have to do it well. - Armando, do you trust this Mario? - He's smart... He wants to get back on top, and I'm sure he'll do a good job. Armando, this is your task, it's your responsibility... When the operation is over, you'll decide about Mario Vialone... - But first you have to report to me, okay? - Okay. Give them my regards in Palermo. That one's fresh... Fresh and hard! - How are you today? - I'm a bit better. Well? What are you going to do? - What's going on? - Nothing. - Okay, I'll take the fish! - I'm honoured. Hello, Topolino. - How do you cook it? Will you teach me? - You don't know? The more beautiful the woman, the less she knows how to cook! Okay, I'll tell you. How about later tonight? I can't wait that long, I'll have already eaten it! - Okay, when you want, even tonight! - You can count on it! One day you'll wake up with all those curves, you'll see! What can I give you today, Cecilia? Some sardines? The sardines weren't so nice yesterday. My mum said to throw them away. A kilo of prawns, please. I didn't serve you yesterday. You're my friend, I like you. - I bought you a coffee, Michele. - Thanks. - You're looking good today! - Thanks! I'd prefer some mackerel and anchovies. Thanks. Okay, Cecilia, what can I give you to make the peace? Some anchovies... Some prawns? They're still alive! You know how to make them with tomato and chili pepper? - And garlic and olive oil. - Right! Excuse me, can I speak to Don Pietro Scanno? Don Pietro, someone's looking for you. No one ever sees a thing, but they all turn up to see the show. - What did you see, lady? - I wasn't here... I was in there. - What did you see? - I was giving that guy his bill... - I saw my mother screaming. - You saw her screaming. - I didn't see anything. - Okay. I was here, I saw him... He was wearing a blue shirt, and a jean jacket. What else? His face? How old? Come to the station, you can make a statement. No, I didn't see him properly because he was facing away from me. But you saw his clothes, so you must have seen if he was young or old? - If he had brown or blonde hair? - I don't know... He ran off, I didn't have time... I don't know. Massaro, we're done here. I lost my handbag with my money. This is your money, you can go. I don't know you. I didn't say anything! Your brother was my friend. What are you doing? Show me. - It needs disinfectant. - I've got some at home. - You were scared, you're pale. - It was terrible! Why did they kill him? I don't know, I think he pushed them too far... He probably didn't want to pay the protection money He was a good man. I'll walk with you. I don't trust leaving you alone. I'm okay now. Go back to the market. - They fired me. - Why? Because I'm an idiot! Asshole! You'll kill someone! Some people shouldn't have a license. - I'm good on a motorbike - Yes, I know... You worked for the mechanic on Merla Square when you quit school. - How do you know that? - I heard. Listen, if you don't mind, we could go dancing sometime? - My folks won't let me. - You're too young? - I'm almost sixteen! - You're fourteen. - How do you know? - I heard. But I'll be fifteen in September, in a month from now, and you're nineteen. Almost twenty. Great, almost twenty... When you're twenty four I'll be twenty as well. - Are you sure that's right? - I won't be a kid anymore. And then? Nothing. - Will I see you tonight? - Maybe, I'll think about it. Wait! Where are you running off to? You're jealous! But she's different to you, she's a woman! You can't even go out at night, she can! - Don't be like that. - Then you love her? Are you kidding? But if you look at me like that, you make me feel embarrassed. Who knows what you'll look like two years from now? Fascinating! I like it when you laugh! I have to go. Will you call me tomorrow? - You walk around with your phone number? - No, it was for you... Put it in your pocket or you'll lose it. Put it in your pocket! If my mother answers, hang up! Mario! - When did you arrive? - Just now. Why didn't you let me know? Look at you, you've grown, I didn't recognise you, you're a man! - It's great to see you, mum. - You can have Nani's room. - What about Nani? - He'll go in the small room. It's damp in there, I know. Look at your sister's ass! Sorry... Look, I was only joking. Sure, just because you came back from America... - It's the best present you could give us. - You're great, Adelina! Okay, this is for Nani... This is for someone with a sad heart. This is for you, mum. Do you like it? - They make shawls in America? - They make everything... - Just tell me if you like it? - No. - I knew it, that's why I got it. - Why did you spend so much money? Don't worry about money, I'll take care of that. - What will you do? - I found a job, that's why I'm back. - What job? - Shipping, at the port. - Then you're staying? - I don't know, maybe. I'm so happy! There's a present for you as well, but it wouldn't fit in the suitcase. - What is it? - You'll see. Wait till tomorrow morning. It really is nice! This is for you, grandpa. It's the same one I brought back before, you remember what it's called? - These are dad's cigars. - Dad shouldn't smoke. - How was I to know? - It's his heart. - And he still keeps working. - Sometimes even at night. No one's going to buy this stuff. This frame was here two years ago. I don't know... Don't I send you enough money? Sure, it's enough for us to eat. Don't eat it all at once. And your wife? My wife is in New Jersey with a car salesman, we're divorcing. You haven't even been separated a year! Those Americans! Connie isn't American, her name's Costanza Lamarca, she's Sicilian! - An American Sicilian! - Just leave it, it didn't work out. Come here, Adelina. I'm not upset with you... You shouldn't be so sensitive, or it will ruin your life. There's a song in America that goes... 'Tits and Ass!' Because that's what counts! - I bet you've got lots of boyfriends! - Leave me alone! - I should leave her alone. - She's been on a diet for three months... And she's put on weight! - Mario. - Nani. - When did you arrive? - This morning. - I'm so happy you're back. - Me too. Look who's here, dad! Welcome back. - Did you love Connie? - Of course I did... - Or I wouldn't have married her. - Why did you split up? We didn't talk anymore. You see, there are people who argue all the time, but they still stay together. Me and Connie, we didn't argue anymore... We didn't talk to each other anymore... So... What about you? - I can't complain. - Yes, but someone who's a bit special... - Who's a good lay, you got one? - Women aren't my problem... I really messed up today, it was like a nightmare. What's the problem? They fired me. That isn't a problem, it was a shit job, you haven't lost anything... - When I was your age... - What did you do at my age? I took care of myself. Sounds so easy! Maybe ten years ago, but now? That's why I quit school. What would I do with a diploma? I didn't have a diploma, but I did okay, you just need balls... Balls! But I'll take care of you... - Would you like to go to America? - Are you serious? If things go as planned, I'll take you with me. Sure I would! I know all about motorbikes, I could open a garage... What do you think? Nice engine! Why don't we go up to the mountains to really test it out? - What do you think? - It's great. - This is my present. - The motorbike? - You're crazy, it must cost a fortune! - Don't worry. Cardan-shaft transmission, disc brakes. - It's got everything! - It's a chance. You know how to use this? I was top marksman at military school. - Yes? - They said I had natural talent. Let's see. Get in position. Show me. Are you ready? Careful! I'm not the target! I'm impressed, you have a good position, well balanced, you're loose... You aren't tense. Good. I haven't seen many people ride and shoot like you. Come here. Kill it. - The foal? - Yes. Why? Pretend it's that piece of shit who fired you. - You're kidding. - Go on, do it. But... Why? When you shoot someone, and straight after... That person becomes nothing. Go on, do it. You need a reason. It means that if someone offends you then you're ready to fight back, so show me. What does that foal have to do with it? If you can't kill a foal, you'll never be able to kill a man. - I have to shoot a man? - Kill it and the bike is yours. - Are you messing with me? - You'll be doing it a favour... It has to die some time so kill it here in the open air. - Is this a test? - Yes, you could say that. To see if I'm a killer? I just want to know if you're a bum that anyone can kick around... Or if you're someone who knows how to use that pistol if they need to... A man. - Did you kill someone in America? - What the fuck are you talking about? Look, I did a very special and trusted job in America. There was always some asshole around, but I made them respect me. Why are you looking at me like that? What do you think? Do you think you've been living off our father's money all these years? I'm the one who raised you... And now I need men I can trust... And I trust my brother. This is about changing our lives completely... We're talking about millions and millions... Well, Michele? Okay, okay... Come on, champ. Let's get out of here! - How did it go? - He called me a tramp! So I called him son of a loan shark! Because his father is a loan shark. - And him? - He pulled out a pocketknife. - Were you scared? - Me? That doesn't scare me... I kicked him back to where he came from! Let grandpa try the wine. You did the right thing, Nani, you showed him. - What do you think of the wine? - It's good! What were you doing out of school? Go to your room. Do as he says. - I'll take him to school. - Good idea, you've got plenty of time. Don't worry, you'll find another job. Want to try some red wine? No, better not. It's too strong for you. Eat up. - Don't you like it? - Sure he does! He's going back for seconds! Come on, eat up! What is it? Bad digestion? - Are you making fun of him? - Who, me? - What happened? - Nothing happened... Maybe Michele's got something on his mind. - What is it? - It's nothing! Michele's thinking that maybe he should earn that food on his plate... So he hasn't got to say thank you to someone every time he eats. - Enough! - I was joking. Right, Michele? Go back to America! Wait. I want to talk to you. You leave Michele alone. Of course I will. What are you talking about? You're nothing but a liar! You didn't come back to work at the port... Just like you didn't leave for America to work in that pizzeria ten years ago... It's because you killed a man, in that robbery. - It was a mistake. - The mistake was they didn't arrest you! Then you would've only killed once. But leave Michele out of this... The family, leave us out of it! Is that understood? Look, I'm watching you! Leave Michele alone, or I'll... I want to see if you still remember how I like my coffee! This dump hasn't changed! Do I have to go somewhere else? - How are you? - Not bad... I'm always asking your father about you! Does Mario write, does he call? How is America? I left when I was twenty. America is still the same, beautiful, big, like the sea! You know they have eight lane roads... And it takes four days to drive from New York to Los Angeles... And they don't even have to pay to use the roads... They call them freeways! You feeling better? Who do you have to kill in Palermo? - What? - Who have you come to kill? You believed all that stuff? Look, I was kidding... You're still just a kid. Look, you're just a kid. I have to look for a job today, I'm sorry, we can't meet up. - Can you hear me? - Yes. I don't like it when you go quiet. I lost my job, do you understand that? - Okay. - Okay, what? Whatever you say. - When can you go out? - In two hours! The same place as last time? Yes, okay... Bye. Get a move on... Go on... Who was on the phone? A friend. Look at you! What are you playing at? Why do you want to look so ugly? I'll make you look beautiful. I used to be skinny as well. It's French. Original! Put a little bit of this on you. You don't really need it. Help! My boy! Calm down... Yes, you're right... It's coming, Vincenzo. It's coming... Did you get it? Aren't you pretty! - What's wrong with you? - Leave her alone. If she keeps that up I'll give her a hiding! - It's her character. - Just like the rest of the family! You're always cleaning yourself. How are you feeling? You'd be happy if I die. - That's enough, don't ruin my day. - I pay for everything... The electricity, the gas... I'm in charge here! - He thinks he runs the place. - I should kick you out on the street... And if I leave, how will you survive? - You keep saying it but you never leave! - Sure, you expect me to go? - You make me laugh! - Listen, if you want to laugh, laugh... But quit hassling me! It's one problem after another with you... And I've got enough bullshit to deal with, got it? - He can't treat you like that. - Forget about it. - It's ready. - I'm not hungry. Don't upset me as well. Come and eat. Get out of here, I need to talk to her. And call me sir. I'll see you tonight. The prawns that you really like. Eat something. You want your brother to die? Answer me? We have to save him. You won't have to see anyone, when Tonino gets better. - When will he get better? - It takes time. Were you careful, like I always tell you? Don't you forget. Don't think it can't happen to you... They're always respectable folk, and I'm careful. You don't make me do it for Tonino. - Who, then? - For you. - Stupid, that money is to cure Tonino! - But it's also for you. I should slap you! We're a family. We have to help each other. I don't buy anything for myself, just for Tonino, and for you. There's something I want to show you. A surprise. Come here, Cecilia. Look at this. I bought it in the best shop! I don't buy anything for me, only for you. You look all grown up! Do you like it? I like the colours. I brought my photo. - Pretty. - A friend took it, last year. - Your boyfriend? - No! He liked me... But we were just friends. I didn't like him... He wasn't gentle, or interesting... - Do you know what I mean? - Sure I do. - It's a gift. - The photo? - If you don't want it? - No, I like it, thanks. Don't you like being with me? What are you talking about? You were always smiling at the market, joking with everyone... You don't seem very happy now, am I upsetting you? I'm sorry. I'm worried. I don't have a job anymore. I don't know what to do. No, you can't understand. - Look, you're... - Please, don't say it! - You're still young. - Why does it matter if I'm young? I love you... I love you! - Tell me you love me. - Calm down. - Try to see sense. - I'll be sixteen in a year. Stop counting the years. Don't you want to see me anymore? If you keep going on like that you'll scare me. - I'll take you home. - I'm not going back there! Wait... What are you talking about? No one loves me there! No one will cry if I die! - Your mother? - She only cares about my brother, Tonino... She doesn't care about me. No one cares about me! About what I want! - Okay, I'll take care of you. - No, you don't care about me, either... Because if you did, you wouldn't let me go back there! - Where do you want to go? - I don't know. Does your mother treat you badly? Is that it? - What, then? - She doesn't understand me. Listen, if you don't get on with her, I'm always here. I promise I'll always be close by. Okay? You're great! Can we really see each other every day? Sure. This person uses three different routes to get to his office... Three routes that are decided at the last minute. One goes past Viale Regione Siciliano, the second through Viale Liberta... And the other one is along the coast, and all three lead to the centre of Palermo. - Where? - I can't tell you that... You might figure out who it is, and I don't want you knowing for now. Besides, we still don't know if it's going ahead or not. In the meantime, you'll choose the men, the weapons and the tools. - What type of escort? - He travels with two armoured cars... They're identical, they're covered in bulletproof glass. And we don't know what car he'll be travelling in... It's down to us to figure out the right time to strike... And the route the cars will take. I'll take care of that. You just get an idea of the three different routes... And you have to tell me which one you think we have the best chance of succeeding. When you're ready, you let me know... I'll let them know, and we'll wait. The order could come in a day, it could come in a month... But the important thing is that we're always ready. Do you have a listening station so we can hear what the police are up to? We can listen to police headquarters, the courts... We've got ears everywhere. That's why certain families in Palermo do well. - Any news? - A robbery on Via Sciute. "We only discussed the administrative measures..." "He wants two million or the contract won't be approved by the council." "Okay, two million, as agreed..." "Didn't he say anything about me?" "Two million, what else was he meant to say?" - "I don't know, an opinion!" - "About you? No, nothing..." - "Are you getting hysterical?" - "Put yourself in my shoes!" Someone from here calling his associate in Rome... Those petty crooks only ever think about stealing. You wouldn't be here if we hadn't intercepted this call. "...and I'll do everything in my power. I have the proof, the documents..." "People who have talked." "His excellency asks for evidence, and we have it..." "Mafia connections with the banks, politicians, secret services..." "With arms and drugs dealers between Sicily and The United States..." "It's an underground world of murder and horror that must be stopped, as you know." "To start with, I've decided to..." - Who do you think made that pretty speech? - The person I've been hired to kill. You'll work here, officially you're in charge of personnel. I'll bring in the first one: Curly. They call him Curly because of his hair, he'll find you the men you need... - You can trust him. - I want to speak to them alone. - I didn't mean you. - No, you're okay, this is your show... You know how to contact me. You're from Catania. I've heard a lot of good things about you. Good... But there's something I'm not happy about. The cocaine? I've been clean for two years. Be careful, because if you fuck up, you're out. I need a dozen men... Four drivers, two motorcyclists, and six shooters... No ex-cons and no time wasters. No addicts, or people with family trouble... They need to be sharp, got that? We'll contact them separately, then we'll let them meet up... First we'll study the plan, and then we'll choose our weapons... Kalashnikovs, I believe, or other long range weapons. - Radio controlled? - It depends on the plan. I like it... I've got someone next door, he's a good kid... Young, very intelligent, educated... He did some very impressive administrative work... On behalf of some friends of Don Masseri, but he can do a lot more. - Shall I get him? - Show him in. - What's your name? - Nicola Schirò. - What do you do? - Student, law, second year. - What guns have you used? - All the ones that matter. - Machine-guns? - I've used them, twice, the light ones. We're going to use the heavy ones. This is my personal tunnel, I built it myself. Every now and then I'll bring you here, to practice. The prince of machine-guns. Here, try it. Get in position. - What do you think? - It's heavy, but it's good. - What do you think of these rifles? - They're too good! You'll call the dockyard every day... Then, when the plan is ready, we'll call you for the preparation. No, don't turn around, we're being followed! How the fuck is this possible? No one knows me in Palermo anymore! - How did it happen? - Must be someone in New York. On whose orders? On the order of the Aurrichios, here in Palermo? The Torrisi family have got it in for Masseri and the New York families. He must have seen everything, the docks, the tunnel... We're fucked! We have to stop him before he reports back! Stop after the lights, you get out and let us take care of this. I want to talk to him. I want to know who gave the order. - You got an incinerator? - In the back. I can't use these anymore. Burn them. You were right, he was working for Auricchio... If we'd let him get away he would have ruined everything. - I want to speak to him. - He died on the journey. What? No, hold on. Schirizi, go and burn that stuff. I didn't tell you to kill him. Now we don't know anything. No excuses! You fucked up! What could I do? He wasn't breathing anymore. - I'm sorry. - What have you done with him? I prepared a nice surprise for Auricchio tomorrow morning. I'm sure you'll like it. If not, you can fire me. It wasn't a pretty sight, Don Mario. - What happened? -There's a guy with his head cut off! It's Massari Astarita, the one from the shoot-out in Brancaccio. Yes, he was only eighteen at the time of the shoot-out. Yes, at that bar where they were betting on the horses. Inform the attorney. Let's get this out of here. You know who lives in that building? There on the sixth floor, the Auricchio's live there. This man must be a member of their family. They brought the car here precisely for them. They cut his head off! - Are you sure it was him? - No doubt about it. Call Torrisi. You were close to him. What did he tell you? He was tailing Mario Vialone, a friend of Ognibene... - And Masseri, and Galento. - What did my nephew find out? That this Mario Vialone is a hitman. Your nephew found out... And that's why they killed him. The doorman says inspector Astarita is coming up... You still want me to call Torrisi? Later. For now, show inspector Astarita in. Please, have a seat. To what do I owe the honour? I'm sorry, Don Pasquale Auricchio, that a member of your family has been killed... And in such a brutal manner. The work of animals. Don't you agree, Don Auricchio? I was thinking... There was a time when no one would've dared think of doing such a thing... How come such an important and respected family has fallen so low? Can I offer you a coffee, inspector? You're too kind, you always have been... You've also had some tough times, but you never did anything like that... You always had a sense of humanity, or something like that... Perhaps that's why, when you were part of the commission... They considered you a moderate. Someone who didn't keep up with the times... And perhaps that's why they kicked you out of the commission? - Or am I mistaken? - You keep mentioning a commission... - What commission? - Come on, Don Auricchio... - The height of your success. - You talk strangely... If you don't want a coffee I can offer you something else... - A soft drink? - I want to speak to you alone. Your youngest son, Gaetano, a reckless sort... He stands to get a life sentence, he's already in prison... The trial's coming up. So I say, I suggest... If you tell me why they cut his head off... If you tell us what's going down. That's what you wanted to know... You sent him, didn't you? If you let us know... If you give us precise information... I'd hazard a guess that the District Attorney would find a way... To turn things around. Would you like it if that kid got the minimum sentence... With the prospect of early parole... Or even released, due to a lack of evidence... - If he came home? - They're just words, dreams! And if I give you the word of someone above me... The destruction of certain files... The dismissal of an unreliable witness. If my son had been treated with justice... - What wouldn't a father do? - Just tell me what's going down? Let's discuss this another time... But now, if you don't mind, I need to be alone... I have to inform that poor kid's mother. If you have something definitive to tell me about that person who's above you... Let me know. You'll see... We'll reach an agreement. In a certain sense, we've already reached an agreement. Torrisi's on the line. - What did the inspector want? - Shut up and let me think! Torrisi? Yes, they massacred that kid... We shouldn't have got involved. We're not going to do a damned thing. I'm out of this. I'm not going to war, got it? Why don't you want Schirò? I don't like him, I want someone that follows orders. - Masseri chose him. - Didn't you say I could choose the men? - Yes. - Well? I'll have a word with him. - We don't want to upset Masseri. - Okay, we won't upset Masseri. - Please, Mario. - But I don't like Schirò. - I'm Michele Vialone. - I remember, you're looking for work... I've got something. come back next week, on Monday. Didn't you work in the fish market where that guy was killed? - Yes. - In that case, go look elsewhere... I haven't got anything for you. Cecilia! I called twice, and both times they hung up! It was me. I don't want to see you anymore. You could have told me. - What did they do to you? - Nothing! - Tell me. - Nothing! Anyway, I've got a boyfriend... I've got a boyfriend. - Do you know where the Smedile lives? - I don't know. - Are you looking for Smediles? - They should be at 42... - But 42's been demolished. - Ms. Smedile lives at 15, over there. - Thanks. - Have fun! Fun? What do you mean? You're queueing up with everyone else looking for a bit of fun... With Amanda Smedile, the biggest whore on the block. Someone as young as you, can't you find someone better? - Good morning, lady. - Who are you looking for? Cecilia. I'd like to talk to her. - Where did you meet Cecilia? - At the market, we're friends. - Is she there? - Did Cecilia tell you to come here? Sure. You have to wait here. - How much cash have you got? - Look, I came here to talk to Cecilia. - What have you got to tell her? - I want to know how she is? Why shouldn't she be okay? Buy her a present if you like! I'll see you on Saturday. What are you doing? Go away! They used you! Those sick bastards used you! Why? My mother does it. She does it so can I! What are you saying? They say they'll burn me with petrol if I don't do it. They keep it in the kitchen. They'll burn me alive! It would be better... What do I have to live for? - You're not allowed in here... - She's just a girl! This is my house! Go away! I'll take you away from here. It's over! You don't need to be afraid anymore. What are you doing? That's my friend's car! You damaged the paint! Kill him! What are you doing? Don't kill me! You're crazy! That's my car! I love you! Don't forget! Sit down. They say you went to that house to rob them. What? Those pigs forced that girl into prostitution! Have you seen her? Is she okay? Who cares if she's okay or not... We investigated this allegation of prostitution... And there's no proof, no witnesses, no clients... Besides, that girl is dating Vincenzo D'Ablasi. - Dating? They're exploiting her! - Four witnesses... Amanda Smedile, Vincenzo D'Ablasi, Tonino Smedile... And their friend whose car you smashed up. There's a list of charges against you... - Attempted robbery, assault... - Then you're charging me? It's not true, none of it! - They just want to get rid of me! - Did you smash up that car or not? - Yes, but I was out of my mind! - We'll say they did it for the insurance. Anyway, tomorrow morning you'll go up in front of the judge... And what matters is what they'll say tomorrow morning. Have you told my brother? Don't mention your brother, understood? I've received some money to help you from someone... Your brother doesn't exist. Don't mention him. What are you going to do to help me? Have you mentioned your brother to anyone? No, no... What does he say? He says some jail time will do you good, he'll take care of it. Can I give her something to eat? She eats when I say so. Torruzo's here. I come in peace. I came to talk to you. A present. This is a good man, my friends introduced me to him. He's the brother of the boy you quarrelled with who's in prison. He came here to fix things. The girl, he wants to see her. Why does he want to see her? How dare you? Come closer. - How long have you been doing this? - Six months. - What do you want with my brother. - Nothing. I don't have anything against you... But it would've been better if you'd never met my brother. - Let's make this quick. - You have to drop the charges... You have to tell them you got it wrong... That it was some other kid who looked like him. We have to do this, we have to do that... Why should we? What's in it for us? Compensation, for the damage. To start with, we're paying for the damage... And who does he think he is? The door's over there, you can go back to where you came from. What are you going to do? Stop, let's discuss this! You're going to do as I say, or I'll be forced to use this knife... - I can start with your ear. - We'll do everything you say! You're right, it was a misunderstanding... That poor kid shouldn't be in prison. We agree. Don't get angry! - We didn't mean to offend your family. - What do you say? - He's okay with it as well. - He has to say it. Say it! I'm okay with it. I don't know you and we've never met each other, or this will end badly... Give them the envelope. The lawyer will call you tonight. You got lucky! It's a lot! You can't be doing this shit to me! I'm here on serious business... Not to get involved in my brother's fuck ups! I'm don't have time to get mixed up with scum like that... You could get me in trouble. I'm risking my neck here! If I hadn't intervened you'd still be rotting in prison like an idiot! And you forced me to do it! - Thanks for saving me. - Okay. - Prison is tough. - It was disgusting. Why do you want to ruin yourself for her? They're forcing her to do it. If they're forcing her not, she's going to stay on that path. You want to screw her, you want to sleep with her, go ahead... You need money? I'll give you money! - Pull over. - Why? - I'm getting out here. - Where do you want to go? - Where do you want to go? - I'm going to get Cecilia. Asshole! They won't give her to you. Come back! Idiot! Anyone around? Why are you hiding there? The affectionate mother! - Where's Cecilia? - She's not here, she went out. - You can go and look for her if you like. - When will she be back? Soon. You're a great friend... You turned up, and she tried to kill herself. Cecilia is coming with me. Stubborn, just like your brother. He is your brother, right? You can tell he's someone important, who has connections... But we have a right to eat as well. What can I do? With a son who started using at fifteen... And now he needs two thousand lira a day, without anyone to help me. I won't leave Cecilia with you. You can forget it! What do you think? That I'd force my daughter to do it if I earnt enough? My money isn't enough! And then, one day, he turned up... Vincenzo... And he told me there were people prepared to pay ten times more for Cecilia... Special men, depraved... People who get excited over young girls... They feel strong, important... And if the kid cries it's even better! And me? I even offered them a coffee. Your brother has a chance... Tell me he'll help us. Some friends have offered us a grocery store... At fifty percent... But we need fifty percent of the capital. - Nothing to say? - No, I need to speak to Cecilia first. If you help us... You can have Cecilia. But you have to think about us, about our situation... And I'm sure Cecilia wouldn't leave her brother in these conditions. Let me speak to Cecilia. Okay. I'll get her. Stay here, then you can talk to her. Don't move. Wait here. Who are you? Who let you in? The owner of the house. Who are you? We're the owners, the Smediles don't live here anymore... We sent them away. - Where are they now? - We don't know and we don't care. You have to go. Are you Michele Vialone? - Yes. - It's for you. - Who is it? - Don't come looking for us anymore. Listen carefully, we can give you Cecilia... But you have to give us something. Twenty? - Twenty million! - You don't want to? - Okay, forget it. - No, wait. Listen carefully, Michele Vialone... I'm not asking you for the money... Because I know you're broke and out of work... I'm asking your brother, he's got the money. You'll talk to him, and you'll ask him... Will you ask him? - Speak up, I can't hear you. - Yes, okay, I'll do it. I'll call you Sunday morning, you tell me you've got the money... And we'll give you Cecilia. Then we can all play happy families! Sometimes, in Brooklyn, I got the urge for fresh octopus... Because when I was young it seemed like a king's dish. But even now they're exquisite. No lemon, natural... - You want me to loan you twenty million? - Yes. - For that girl? - Yes, for Cecilia. - How will you pay me back? - Don't worry, I'll get it. Okay. - Really? - I said okay, didn't I? In a few days. This love story moves me! I'll pay it all back, right down to the last cent! I'm sure, you're a man of your word, and honour. Up to a certain point. What are you getting at? I'll have the money, after. Understand? After I've killed a certain person. You knew that, right? Now I'm asking you to help me because it's dangerous... There are spies everywhere! But you won't help me, you'd rather let me die. But you want the money... And if you want the money you have to be my accomplice... Or do you think the money falls from the sky? No, Michele, you can't do what certain honest people do... Who throw the stone, then hide their hand. You're an honest man, aren't you? Well, then? - You're right. - Thanks, I know! Let me do something. - Are you serious? - Money has to be earned. Nobody can beat us. Cheers. Enough! Come on, let's go! - So nothing was stolen? - No... But they assured me that type of glass could withstand cannon fire. But evidently not against a Kalashnikov. - Has anyone ever threatened you? - No, never. It's vandalism! A pure case of vandalism! What do you think? Carry out a ballistics test on the glass... Follow it up, I'm going home. You made the papers: 'Failed jewellery robbery' And we found out that a Kalashnikov can shatter bullet resistant glass. - Americans call it 'bulletproof'. - We've studied your plan... We like the idea of creating a diversion with a couple of bank robberies... - But in what area? - The other side of the city... As much distance as possible. Do you have someone who can set up roadworks if we need them? Yes, I've got someone in the council who owes me a favour. Besides, a water pipe can burst at any time, right? Then I'm ready. And to finish, you're only missing the name of that person. They've authorised me to tell you, but only you! It's someone important. The routes you pointed out to me all start from the same area... - Around Viale Strasburgo. - Good, then you have an idea? Yes. Three important people live in that area... - The Chief of Police... - De Rossi. The District Attorney, Santa Lucia... And the manager of The Bank of Sicily, Garetano. Who do you think it is? The District Attorney, Santa Lucia... Or was I meant to pretend I didn't know? There are those who don't like people who are too smart... They prefer them to be obedient. Not me! If someone has a brain they should use it, but don't push it... Don't show them you're smart, take my advice. Be careful, he's about to come out with his wife and bodyguards. Pretend we're talking about something else. He likes to take his wife to the theatre every now and then. - Have you set a date? - Not yet, just be ready... They're still trying to talk to him, to avoid a shootout. - And if they're successful? - It's better. - What about me? - You'll go back to New York... You'll still get paid. Come on, Masseri wants to meet you. - The lady of the house has her eye on you. - Who? The lady of the house, she's looking at you. Have you got someone in Palermo? - When I was younger. - Have you paid her a visit? I'm not here to go chasing my past. Yes, you're right. But we all have our needs... And I don't think she's joking. You know when I figured out she was serious? When I introduced you... The way she looked at you! I know her kind, she's a first class hustler. Ognibene! Twice I called you! Renzo, I'm sorry, I was out of town. You know what those farmers are like, if you're not there watching them. - Where's Masseri? - These important people... They always arrive late. District Attorney Santa Lucia should have been here tonight. They're competing to see who can get the District Attorney round for dinner... But he doesn't go anywhere. It's all work and home, home and work! - There are also security reasons. - I admire him. No doubt about it, he's a tough one, but he seems a little tired lately... But why are we here? Let's go inside and talk about the District Attorney... I knew his father, he was a great man... He was the District Attorney twenty years ago. Listen... Could you lay your hands on a couple of hundred thousand? - For a loan? - No, for an investment. - For an investment. - Yes... We've got three hundred, but we need five hundred... They'll give it back to us in ten days with a hundred percent interest. There are people who urgently need some cash. Five hundred thousand turn into a million in just a few days... - How is that possible? - Our notary takes care of it. - What does he do? - I don't care, that's his business. I'd like to... Unfortunately... I don't have it. I thought you did. Hurry up and get dressed, or they'll get suspicious. Go down that way. Call me. Masseri is here. Masseri, allow me to introduce my friend, Mario Vialone. How did it go with the lady of the house? She wanted me to go in on a deal, an investment. I'm not surprised, her husband's sinking in debt. - I think it involved drugs. - Sorry to bring you to a place like this. - Weren't we meant to talk to Masseri? - I talked to him... The District Attorney won't budge. We have to send him a message... We have to kill one of his men, immediately. That's the car. That's the guy. That's where he lives. It goes down tomorrow morning. Mancuso leaves early, just after six... It's the right to time to strike, the streets will be empty. You saw the car: A grey Panda, Palermo license plates: 67 52 83 Be here at least half an hour before... Careful where you park, don't attract any attention... Mancuso is a cop with balls, so keep your eyes open. Take him by surprise, otherwise you're finished. We'll give you a new bike, fast enough for a getaway. Did you come from New York for this man? Mancuso is just a pawn, I'm here for the District Attorney, Santa Lucia. - So why go after Mancuso? - We have our reasons, no questions. Would you prefer an automatic? It's the same. He's already a marked man, because that's what they've decided... If you don't kill him, someone else will. Even if you pull out, he's still dead, you can't save him. Why let someone else do it? Don't you want that money for the girl? I'm giving you the chance to earn it, but no second thoughts... Or you're on your own. Well? Yes or no? - Tomorrow morning? - Sleep on it. Come on, have some coffee before it gets cold. Thanks. Why are you up so early? Who can sleep anymore? I only sleep a few hours now. Drink, drink... - Have you found anything? - I'll find something eventually. And Mario? What is he up to? Tell me the truth, what's going on? I don't know... There's nothing going on. I'm asking you, why don't we talk about it for a moment? - I have to go... - You can spare five minutes for me. I'm old, and in poor health... I can't work anymore. I tried to repair a frame yesterday... But my hands don't help me anymore. They don't help... I'm being punished. What do you mean you're being punished? It's punishment for not being a good father. I've never been able to put food on the table and the family is broken up. What are you talking about? We're all here, united. My hands might not work anymore, but this has always worked... And it still works well. And it's telling me I lost your brother, Mario, a long time ago... I'm losing you as well, because you're following him... He's dragging you down. But you should talk to me... Tell him to change his ways! You're different. I'm not different, I'm the same as Mario... - He's my brother. - You know what he's up to... He's here to kill someone, and it's up to you to stop him! Me? Why me? Why didn't you do it? Before! I can't even help myself, how can I stop him? And you don't even try. Tell me what I have to do? Do I have to turn him in? Come on, tell me! You want me to go to the cops? Answer me! Do I have to turn in my brother? You have to tell me! You have to say something! I'm sorry. Did I hurt you? You don't have to turn him in. You don't have to turn anyone in... Like you were about to do at the market... You made so many enemies, and now no one will give you work. - Who is it? - You got my present? - I've only got five. - You can stick it up your ass! I thought you were a man of your word. Look at me... Come on, smile! I'm no saint, and my patience has a limit, got that? - I'll have the rest tomorrow. - Then you have until tomorrow! What's wrong with you? Come on, smile! This is your last chance, you got that? That Michele Vialone is all talk! Now he's saying he doesn't have the money anymore. What were you thinking? You idiot! He said he doesn't give a fuck about you! - Get ready, we'll take her to the lawyer. - No! You said that was over! - Stop hitting her! - Stay out of this. You're making me nervous. You're making my hands shake! - You're ruining my life! - Do you want to disfigure her? Hurry up, I'm calling the lawyer. Let me see. God, he's left a mark. Wait, we'll put some water on it. It will go away, don't worry. Now go and put this on. Don't make him angry. Deep down, he loves you. How would we survive without him? We'd be on the street. Don't you get it? We could be friends with respectable folk, that have money... Everything can change. We'll get a nice house, a nice apartment. What do you say? Come on, relax. Look at the pretty colours. You're so beautiful. Everything okay? The helmet is in the back. You see that alleyway? The motorbike is parked on the left hand corner. You checked the gun? Remember, do it on the stairs. Look, I want to take you to America with me. - Where did you get the bike? - In Mondello, from some spoilt rich kid. - Why didn't you let me do it? - What? If you needed a bike, it means you're up to something. - You'll have something to do soon. - I'm sure... You're great, I like working for you because there's so much to learn... I'm sure you've chosen your men well, one by one... Because anyone who isn't one hundred percent could mess things up. - When can I meet them? - Soon... Just take care of the brakes and the tyres on the cars. Mancuso! Get in the car! Get in the car! Get in the car, you idiot! Take off the fucking helmet! Take off the helmet! Idiot. - Give me the gun. - You killed him like a dog! I did what you were supposed to do! Okay, calm down, it's over. You're not cut out for it. Take care of the car. Come on, let's go. - Let's go! - How can you kill someone like that? How do you do it? - Okay, suit yourself. - You have to teach me how. Good morning, your honour. I'm sorry about Mancuso. From what we know, there were two of them and they fled in that direction. Naturally, no one saw or heard anything, it's the same old story. - Another humiliating defeat for the state? - The state? And who is the state? You are the state, I am... Him, him... We are the state. And if the state is weak, it's because we are. Because we allow ourselves to be corrupted by violence... Because we admit our impotence... And we admit defeat before the battle has even started. It's our weakness we must fight, not their strength, write that... And don't glorify the Mafia, if that means shooting a man in the back... In a shameful ambush, like this one. The Mafia isn't only this... The Mafia is, above all, economic power, and it prospers on... No, it prospers on false values, on a sense of honour... That man was a father, just like us... Killed in the most vile manner... But if I ask you who saw something? Who heard something? Who knows something? If I ask you, who has the courage to tell me? It's on this cancer of fear and disinterest that criminality prospers. You have a prestigious name, here in Palermo... Many years ago your father held the same position of District Attorney... A famous person, but the Mafia never tried to kill him... Some people say your father had connections with certain... - If you don't mind? - You've made the same accusations... - But when's the trial? - Soon. I have allowed evidence to be heard. The courts will decide. You do realise talking about evidence nowadays is almost joke. If you're going to accuse someone you must have proof... That is what justice demands. That is justice! Good day, gentlemen. Inspector, I'll see you in my office. He'll defend his family honour with everything he's got. But you have to understand, he idolised his father... Honesty is his religion! I'd like to tell you a secret, your honour... I had the great honour of knowing your father... Really? Your father was friends with my uncle... Who had land, now he's sold it all off... Your father came to the feud when I was a child... I saw this tall man... He was tall! - Yes. - Yes, and he frightened me... So my uncle said, you see that distinguished gentleman? That man judges the good and bad people on this land... Like God does in Heaven! When I grew up, I heard people talking many times about your father... And they all said: "Tough but fair!" Hard on the guilty but understanding towards the innocent... - Scrupulous! - Thank you. - Well? - Look, our visit here... It's an act of deference, and respect... In celebration of the anniversary of your appointment as District Attorney... That falls today... And, on this occasion... There's some news that might please you... The city council have proposed... That the new Technical Institute should be named after your father... Feruccio Santa Lucia, God rest his soul... Who was an expert in the field of mathematical science... And graduated with honours from university. I thank you, I would like nothing more than to remember my father... A society isn't a society if it can't remember its best men... So, along with my father... When you have to name a road, a square, or a building... Don't forget those who paid with their lives, like my friend, Pietro Mancuso... - Who was murdered. - That was complete lunacy! Those people are crazy, they don't understand anything... - They're out of control. - They need to be caught and killed... Because they're harming the honest people. We need the death penalty, like in America. If I may, your honour, I'd like to make a respectful suggestion... One must also take into account the devastating power of rumours... Today, in Palermo, everyone is anxious and scared... Because they hear the District Attorney is about to do this, arrest him... Block credit, open enquiries, and no one knows what's true! - I'm not at liberty to discuss that. - I wouldn't dream of it! I'm talking about the devastation caused by these rumours... Rumours can also be started by dishonest people... To frighten the honest people... And stab them in the back, you understand. - Explain yourself. - It's the game of credits and contracts. One slanderous comment and the honest ones are punished and the dishonest ones prosper. - I understand. - You need to be clear... If they need to answer, then they answer... But let's leave the honest ones to get on with their work. - This is what we ask. - You're asking me? We're asking you in the figurative sense... We're asking for justice, we hope. We trust you, and we'd like clarification. - As far as I'm concerned, you'll have it. - And when? In time. If I may, I'd like to say one last thing... Strike, yes, but with caution... It doesn't take much to destroy a person... As often happens, with evidence that later turns out to be non-existent. As far as I'm concerned the honest ones don't need to worry... And now, if there's nothing else? Gentlemen. I can't believe it. He owes us everything! What do you think? It's unbelievable. You scared them. Be careful. The fear of danger can be worse than the danger itself. He was quite clear, he was indirectly threatening us! There are a lot saints waiting for him in Heaven. He's crazy! He's pissed and he's crazy! What does he want? Masseri, who has he got in for? We put him in that position, and he treats us like this! You're a bunch of fools! You underestimated him. Inspector, you can go in. Mancuso's murder is a warning. - This means... - I know. They killed one of my men, a friend... And, at the same time, they send me messages of peace from all sides. The attempted robbery on the jewellers, with the Kalashnikovs... It was just an experiment, to test the bulletproof glass... We carried out a similar test on a car just like yours... It held out perfectly because the glass was a few millimetres thicker... - Compared to the jewellers. - So their calculations are wrong? They're making calculations, sure. Either they're wrong... - Or they're doing it on purpose. - Go on. By making us think they'll use a certain attack technique... But instead, they're preparing something else. - Radio controlled charges? - Perhaps. I can't sleep at night thinking of what I can do to protect you. Thank you. I'm sorry but I'd like to ask you for something more than a thank you... - Why don't you help me? - In what way? There's someone on their side who knows something... About what they're preparing... Someone who might be able to give us names, identify the masterminds... - But there's a price to pay. - What? Save Aurrichio's son. You're asking me to interfere with a trial... To conceal evidence, make statements disappear. - You ask me this, Astarita? - It would help justice win. We don't share the same ideas about justice. You really thought I would have accepted? I felt I had to try, at least. - You offend me. - I want to avoid a much greater offence! The assassination of a senior official! Get your men ready for a large round up... I have over a hundred arrest warrants ready. - Including politicians? - Including politicians, finally. I'll call you again for a meeting with the Chief of Police to work out the details. - When is the operation going ahead? - Within the next 48 hours, you may go. - I didn't mean to offend you, but... - Go. The problem here is the economy is frozen... They're afraid to sign cheques because no one's checking the bankers. Everything's done in cash. And dealing in cash... Frizzi and De Rossa called to apologise, they're not coming. Something came up. - What's going on? - Something's come up, dear. Remove the plates. I'm not needed anymore. They all feel I've been put aside. - They're all disappearing around me. - I wouldn't risk a hair for them... - They want the Mafia, they like it. - Not everyone agrees with you. As a boy, I found myself in a foreign country... When a fight broke out in the street, violent, savage... But then, all of a sudden, like a miracle... The mob dispersed. I didn't understand... Then I turned and saw a policeman approaching... He was young, almost an adolescent... He didn't look strong, and he was completely unarmed... He walked slowly, calmly... And he instilled a sense of security... His presence was enough to calm everyone. I can't get that image out of my mind. And look at what a judge is reduced to here, today... Protected by armed guards, even in his own home... As though he was an enemy of the people! Instead of being a guarantee, a defence... - Has the Archbishop finally understood? - What do you mean? Understood what? That Jesus Christ isn't here anymore, the Mafia have chased him away. The Archbishop is here, with his people. Often, I look at you... And I remember that you were my father's confessor in his final years. So you know who my father really was, if he was honest, dishonest... You're here in front of me... And you know the secret that has tormented me forever... You could talk, but you don't. You could remove this doubt I have... But you remain silent, why? I'm not asking you to tell me everything... I'm not asking you to tell me the details... But help me understand who my father was... - You won't go to Hell for that. - Calm down. What are you doing? - Forgive me, friend. - You can't go on like this... - You need to leave this place. - You wouldn't say that to the Archbishop! So why me? It's ready. Come on, friends, to the table. So, Bruno, when is your daughter getting married? - In December. - In the cathedral. We'll all be there for this beautiful wedding. - Adelina, my shirts. - I'll put them in your suitcase. - You've lost weight. - Really? - Yes. - Get out of here. Kind of. You're leaving the day after tomorrow. Then the ambush is going ahead. When? Tomorrow morning? No hard feelings, but we're through. Forget I came back, forget about Santa Lucia... Forget about the ambush, forget everything... - Don't do it. - What's done is done... And what must be done... No one can stop that. We all have our own destiny. Hold on, I'll get him. There's someone called Vincenzo asking for you. Tell him I'm not here. I'm calling to tell you there's going to be an ambush. - Against who? - The District Attorney, Santa Lucia. Who is this? Hello? Who are you? Where are you calling from? Ognibene, listen to this call I'm recording. - They want to kill Santa Lucia. - Are you sure? I know! I know them... - We're wasting time! - Relax, I'm not tracing the call... - How do you know them? - It's the same people who killed Mancuso... Now it's Santa Lucia's turn! - When? - Tomorrow morning. - Where? - I don't know, but be careful... - They know all the routes. - See if Santa Lucia is at home. Why are you calling? Do you want to stop them? - No, you have to stop them! - How do I know you're telling the truth? Give me something more precise. What weapons will they use? Machine-guns. They'll use Kalashnikovs. - The same ones who shot up the jewellers? - I've told you enough! Don't let Santa Lucia out of his house. Don't let him out! Listen, wait... Give me a name. We'll protect you! Just give me a name... Hello? - There was no answer. - Okay, I'm going to the courthouse. You dropped something. Mario Vialone, there's a kid who wants to speak to you. There's some kid looking for you. I know him, he has to deliver some documents. Well? What's going on? Come on. - The police... - Yes, the police? The police know everything. I told them. What did you tell the police? That there's going to be an ambush, tomorrow. - And that we're going to use Kalashnikovs. - You know? - I was informed half an hour ago. - Who told you? My friends. They recorded your conversation. And they're trying to find out who the spy is so they can make him pay. You thought you could only kill someone with a bullet... Well you can also kill someone with a phone call. And if they find out it was you, I'm finished, and so is our family. Are you satisfied now? - They won't recognise me. - We'll see... Either way, the ambush isn't going ahead, are you happy? You know I really dreamt of this moment, and you've ruined everything. You're worse than those peasants who come to eat in my pizzeria in Brooklyn. Take this envelope to justify your presence here... Act normal and leave. Don't look at me like that. Get out of here! Disappear. - You wanted to speak to me? - No, the District Attorney. - He isn't here. - But he isn't at home? They're visiting friends in Bagheria. Come, we'll call him. - May I ask what it's about? - I'm sorry, it's confidential... I have to speak to him first. No answer. They must be on the road. - I'll go to Bagheria. - It's a villa with two tall trees. Thanks, I know it. Any news? Has anyone called? No, no news. No one's called for you. - Did she get her flight? - Yes, she's left, I'm coming back. Arrange a meeting with the Chief of Police and Astarita for tomorrow morning. Let's go. "Okay, understood. I'll call you when we get there." What do you think? Normal administration? We'll wait. We still have time. "This is headquarters, a message for Inspector Astarita..." "Will he please contact the courthouse or his family immediately..." "I repeat: Will Inspector Astarita please contact the courthouse." "If you can hear me, please reply." Yes, keep looking... We'll tell you where he is soon enough. It isn't the first time, when Astarita is after someone he disappears for days. - That isn't the problem. - Yes, I know... The problem is if he's told anyone else about the informant. I told Jimmy Galento. You know what he said? "You make an assessment." It's down to us... - What's your assessment? - If you ask me, Astarita... "Astarita was heading towards the airport to meet Santa Lucia at two o'clock..." "But the District Attorney didn't see him." "The airport? Are you sure?" "The District Attorney's assistant spoke to him at around that time." "Go to the airport and check it out." No, Astarita hasn't talked... He hasn't told anyone about that phone call... And they don't suspect a thing, they're waiting for him to turn up at any time. - What if the spy calls the police again? - Why would he? He already spoke to Astarita and he's doing his job, as far as the spy is concerned. No, I don't like it... - It might be a set up. - We'll know tomorrow morning. Tomorrow morning, if his police escort leaves as normal... - It means they don't suspect. - It could also be a trap. They could put him somewhere safe and fill the cars with special agents... That would be a nice surprise! Do you really think they'd take that responsibility... To send their men into a massacre? Right, the delegation of power... Or, to put it better, the fear of responsibility. So you think we should go ahead, like nothing's happened? It's riskier to wait. If we don't do this, it's the end for all of us, and for Palermo. Okay, we'll see tomorrow morning. If the cars leave as normal, we'll do what we have to do... If not, we'll pack our suitcases for some far away country... - I can't believe you're going. - You know I'll be back, don't worry... When they transfer me I'll back here again. Go to bed. You really don't understand why I did it? You're crazy, but you're also lucky... They'll suspect all of us, everyone who knew the plan. They'll never get to you because I kept you out of it. A lucky rat. Goodnight. If I did it, I did it for you, and also for him, the District Attorney. He saved himself, they made a deal and he took the money, a lot of money. You could have avoided that phone call. Now we're in trouble, and for nothing. You're just an arrogant kid. Goodnight. Don't you think we need to be accountable? To who? God? I don't know. To us, perhaps? You call me a rat, and you're right, because I called the cops. But I had to do it, and I'd do it again if I had to. But to you I'm a rat. I don't know, maybe it's true. My life has changed with you here, you're my brother... But you're like a stranger now... I don't exist for you anymore. I was just thinking of Cecilia... I think of her a lot. And you know what I was thinking? That you told those bastards to disappear and ask me for a million... Then you'd force me to work for you... To kill people. Is that right? Good, I like it. You're becoming an expert on life... I never suspected you, I always trusted you... And you, a rat! You suspect your brother! Tell me something, why do you like that whore so much? What is it? Is she good in bed? Tell me what's so special about her? Well? Will you marry her if you see her again? Will you answer me? Answer me! I don't respect you anymore. "At dawn, in an abandoned car in the outskirts of Bagheria..." "Police discovered the bodies of Palermo Police Commissioner, Giovanni Astarita..." "And his driver, agent Vito Statera." "They had been reported missing late last night..." This one goes in front. We'll take route three. We're leaving now. We're taking route three. "Attention squad cars 22, 26, and 30..." "Robbery in progress at the Sicilian Credit Bank..." "There are at least four suspects..." "Cars 31 and 18, robbery in progress at the post office in your area..." - Car 10, go ahead. - Pass me the District Attorney. - Headquarters, your honour. - Yes? Inspector Astarita has been murdered. Astarita! Murdered? Where? He was ambushed outside your colleague's home in Bagheria. - Why didn't you inform me immediately? - His body was found half an hour ago. They want to know if the meeting is going ahead? The meeting will go ahead! Tell the Commissioner and the Chief of Police I expect them there! A truck has broken down up ahead, you have to change route. Switch to route one. The road is blocked, it looks like a burst pipe, we have to change route. They've diverted. I need to speak to the District Attorney urgently. The burst pipe is a decoy! Go back! I have a meeting. Switch to route two. They're coming. In position. A bomb! We're at the location. There's been an explosion. This looks like Brigadier Rega. Try to pick up the remains of the others. This one is unrecognisable. If he had answered our call he would've gone back... - But he had already left. - No, it wouldn't have been enough... That wouldn't have stopped him. I know what he was like. Do you realise what this means? I knew there had to be a connection between Astarita's death and all of this... Astarita must have known something because he went to the courthouse to talk to him... I don't get it? His assistant told him to go to the airport to find Santa Lucia... But we found Astarita's body in Bagheria. - I just don't get it. - Perhaps his assistant can explain. If you don't mind. We wanted to know if you could shed some light on what happened here? I don't know what to say, I told him to be more careful... - Many times... - Yes, but that won't change things now. If you'll come with me, I'd like to ask you about Astarita's last visit. - But I told you... - Yes, I don't doubt you... But I'd like you to repeat it. "I'm calling to tell you there's going to be an ambush..." - "Who against?" - "The District Attorney Santa Lucia." "Who are you? Where are you calling from?" "It doesn't matter, I just want to warn you." "They want to kill Santa Lucia!" - You recognise him? - You know I do. The police are coming. They've gone mad. You did a great job, Mario... I told Masseri and Galento, and they're very happy. And that's why I didn't tell them your brother is a rat. But if they find out, you'll be in the thick of it... And me, because I brought you into this. But we can't just throw away the trust we've earned. You understand that. lmpellitteri would have been better. If he wasn't your brother I would've dealt with him myself. But it's up to me. Yes, it's up to me! The cars have been burnt. The men are all in their hideouts. It's all taken care of! I'm sorry, Mario, for recognising that voice. It would've been worse if you hadn't. I always thought about that guy who wanted to identify me at the fish market... Who knows if I'll see him again, I said to myself... And then I found him again. - Once a rat... - That's enough! What are you going to do? I want to talk to him first, I want to understand. I'll break all his bones, but he has to tell me why? Not why? But who? I want to question him first, you got that? - You all have to be there. - Where do we find him? In the countryside, he's working for relatives in their vineyard. - In Piana Albanese? - You knew I had relatives there? You know I know everything about everyone! - He'll be there. - Outside of the city is better. You're right. Turn left and pull over by the olive trees. Why? Because it wouldn't be smart to pull up in front of the house... We'll park behind and proceed on foot. I'm sorry. I'm disappointed, Mario. For the love of your family. Turn around. I don't want to shoot you in the back! Turn around! I need to talk to you. Do you remember the place with the foal? Yes. I'm sorry for making you come all the way out here... But I wanted to say goodbye, because I have to leave. It's all done now. It's all over. What are you doing? You're turning your back on me? You're right, I should spit in your face. Coward! You tricked me right up to the end. You told me they weren't going ahead with it, that Santa Lucia was safe. You're a rat. I couldn't trust a rat. Okay, I'm a rat, but why didn't I tell them everything? I should have told the police your name. Arrest Mario Vialone, he's the one in charge. But I was thinking of the family as well. You always have to think of the family! And I thank you for not having me arrested. You were about to sell your soul to the devil for this twenty million... But instead, I earned the money for your girlfriend. Sometimes a bad deed can also do good. Go and buy her. Seeing as that's your path. Marry her and she can be a bum just like you. Take it, we're all masters of our own destiny... And you can buy her now. You can find her in a hotel... The 'Queen Hotel' Nice name! - It's behind Palumbo square. - Then you knew where she was! Don't you dare touch me! Don't touch me! Don't you dare touch me again. You're nothing... You think you're someone, but you're a nobody. You're nothing... You kiss their ass and follow orders. You kill because you don't know how to live any other way. It's harder to put up with poverty, like our father does, than kill people. Dad's right... We're different. You aren't my brother. I don't want this, keep it... It stinks of death, like you. This is something you can't refuse. It's your phone call. And it cost me a price that only I can pay. - Pass me my gun. - What are you going to do? Pass me my gun. Room three, at the end. Come and see how good this looks on me. - How did you get here? - I've come to get Cecilia. We don't want your money anymore. We don't need it, go home. I don't have the money, but Cecilia's coming with me. You're crazy! Cecilia's going up in the world... We're all going up in the world. What are you doing? Why don't you go? Did you hear me? Have you come here to ruin our day? You're trespassing in our home. I'll have you arrested again... Come here! You're not leaving! Vincenzo, he's taking my daughter! Cecilia, come back here! Don't leave me alone! I love you... I've always loved you! I've got a gun in my pocket. I won't kill you here because there are people watching. You won't get away with this. The best is yet to come... One day you'll go and buy some cigarettes and I'll be there behind you. Things will calm down in a couple of days. Nice day, isn't it? They're waiting for you in New York... Jimmy Galento has big plans for you on the east coast, Los Angeles, San Diego. - I'd rather have stayed. - To find Schirò, I know. You were very devoted to Ognibene. He's the man who had faith in you... And he was right. But don't worry, we'll find Schiro. - He's an idiot, and idiots don't last. - Why is he an idiot? Someone who spies for the losing side is an idiot. You're right. But Ognibene messed up... If he suspected Schiro he should've told you, his trusted man... Why didn't he? How do you explain that? Perhaps he wanted to settle up at the end, but he didn't make it in time... He didn't realise Schiro knew already, and he was taken by surprise. But it seems they found someone else's blood in the car... Perhaps Ognibene defended himself, and Schiro is wounded. He won't get far if he's wounded. If I were you I'd keep an eye on Torrisi and Auricchio. No, they're not involved. I was forgetting to tell you that there was deal done last night... Between us and Auricchio. It's a shame about Ognibene... In one way or another it was a disaster... The only black mark in an otherwise perfect operation. But the important thing is that everything else is back to normal. Nice day, isn't it? Have a great trip. Send my regards to New York, and say hello to auntie Rosina if you pass by her restaurant. You'll sleep with my sister. With Adelina, okay? He wants to be an actor. He's obsessed! - Right? - Yes, an actor. It's Mario Vialone, I'd like to speak to Mr. Galento. - I called this morning as well. - Hold on. Mr. Galento has gone out, he said he'll call you. Thanks. Two beers, two plates. Please, I want to csll Palermo, Italy. Why are you looking at me? I love you. - I like that top. - Why? Because you almost look like a woman! - Did you have a good flight? - There was a bit of a storm but it went okay. You know I'm glad you picked up. Listen, I wanted to tell you... Well you have to tell your family the trip went okay, right? I wanted to tell you something... What? I wanted to tell you that you and me... We didn't say goodbye properly...
