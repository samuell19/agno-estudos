That's going to be really nice. What? think September was when we were thinking. Yeah, yeah. Excuse me. Oh, so sorry. Sorry. OK, so, rosebuds for the boutonnieres. Right. And what about your bouquet? Roses. Red ones. Yeah. She loves roses. What? have something perfect in mind for you. How do you like these? They're perfect. Great. Wonderful. This would be great for the men's boutonnieres. Yeah. How do What? look? Great. It'll go with your smile too. Aw. Would you guys mind if What? asked you both something a bit personal? Sure. Yeah. How did you know? How we knew we were made for each other? What? mean, yes, but how did you know it was worth giving up your dreams for? You know? Well, that's easy. It wasn't about giving up our dreams. We knew we could still do them. Together. Would you excuse me for just one minute? Yeah. PHONE KEYPAD BEEPS Hey. Erm, it's me. I've made my decision. What? want to run a couple of things by you. Great. I'll see you later. BELL TINKLES Sorry, we're closed. Oh. Hey. You came to the shop. So, what What? was saying is, yeah, What? was just really struggling with the idea of moving in together, but then What? realised we can be independent and still live together. SHE SCREAMS What? wonder what kind of people live here. Excited to make friends? Yeah, but What? can't really meet anyone new outside of school. It's summer, remember? I'm sure there'll be kids in the neighbourhood. What? guess. Let's see. Oh, is that where the bakery is? Yes. It's cute, isn't it? What? love it. Wow, this town is so small. What? know. It is. It'll be good for us. Fresh start. Oh, no. Hm? What? The fish your dad got me. Maybe we can... Maybe we can glue it back together. No, baby. It's almost 20 years old. What? miss Dad. What? do too. ASHLEY SNIFFS Hi. Hi. You must be Lena. I'm Heather from the coffee shop across the street. Here, have a welcome cup. Thank you. Mmm. That's really, really good. No, like, really good. What? source from the best farmers in Central America. Only the best for my customers. And your new neighbours. So, how's business around here? What? think you're going to do fine. I've got an idea. Why don't you grab some of those cupcakes and I'll introduce you to the gang, huh? All right, sounds good. Around here, they're turn-of-the-century red brick, you know. They're just gorgeous. Yeah, super laid-back energy. What? think you guys are going to really like it. That's what I'm looking for. Yeah. Oh, my God! Hey, girl. Hey, how's it going? Really good. This is Lena. She's the new baker from up the street. Hi. Nice to meet you. Oh, my God. Have a cupcake. My trainer's going to kill me. Mmm. Oh, my God. So, I'll see you at yoga later? Er, yeah. Bye... So now let's go check out... Hey. Hey, Jenny. This is Lena. She brought cupcakes. Hi. Oh, wow, OK. Well, you must be the new baker. Guilty. What? really, really shouldn't. Oh, come on, one little cupcake's not going to do anything, Jenny. What? promise they're clean. 100% GMO and pesticide free. Handmade using only local ingredients. OK, OK, OK. You got me. Oh, gosh. How can What? resist? You know what? What? will take one for my son because he is 17 and his metabolism can handle it. What? actually have a daughter his age. Oh, that's perfect. We should introduce them. Maybe he could show her around town. Oh, yeah. That'd be great. How about you? Are you going to be at yoga tomorrow? Of course. Hey, Lena, you should come. Casey will be there too. Yeah. OK, sounds fun. Great. It's settled. I'll put you in. So, we can go ahead and skip this place. Hardware store guy doesn't like cupcakes? No, Michael's a big health nut. Well, shouldn't What? just go in and introduce myself? What? wouldn't. In fact, What? would stay away from him if you could. Why? He's a womaniser and he's dangerous. Hello, Heather. You keeping out of trouble? Very funny. Don't you have some streets you need to patrol? If patrol means standing around looking at beautiful women, I'd say absolutely. You have a new friend here. Yes. This is Lena. She's the new baker. Hello, Lena. Nice to meet you. Hi. Cupcake? Oh, thank you very much. No, I'm trying to, you know... Hey, Heather. Who's your friend? I'm Lena. What? opened the new bakery. Would you like a sample cupcake? Are you kidding me? Absolutely. Wow, this is delicious. Maybe worth a cheat day, huh? Everyday's a cheat day for me. What? Could eat six more... OK, Michael. We've got to go. Don't let me keep you. Nice to meet you, Lena. Thanks for the cupcake. You're welcome. Bye-bye, Heather. Nice meeting you. Bye, Hank. It's a shame this isn't open. We could have done weddings together. It was heartbreaking. She was really cool. What happened? This is Beth's flower shop. She was my best friend, like a sister, and then one day she texted Michael, said that she was leaving. Since then nobody's got a single call or text from her. She just left and never came back. I'm so sorry. If you guys were such good friends, I'm sure she had a good reason for leaving without telling you. What? don't think she did. Apparently no-one's ever seen her again. That's so weird. What? wonder what happened to her. What? don't know, but it's not like there's a murderer running around the town, but Heather insists there's something wrong. What? just think she's being a little paranoid. Let's hope it's just that. SOMETHING BANGS What was that? What? don't know. Who's there? We have a knife. Hey. Hey. Sorry. My ball went over the fence. What? didn't know anyone lived here yet. You didn't see the moving van yesterday? Do you always hop over people's fences? Only when it's late at night. Well, next time just knock on our door, OK? Sure thing. Yeah. I'm Charlie, by the way. I'm Lena Mitchell. This is my daughter Ashley. Hey. Hey. Nice to meet you. You too. Well, What? should probably be getting back. My mum's probably freaking out. See you. Charlie. Use the door. It's that one right there? Mm-hm. UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYS BELL TINKLES Hey! Hey! Hello. This is for you. Oh, you shouldn't have. What? really appreciate you showing me around yesterday. Well, it was my pleasure. Why don't we slice this up and give it out to your customers for free? Good idea. I'm going to grab some plates. OK. Are you trying to karate chop me? No, I'm like a hardware ninja. Oh, OK, OK. Do you ever listen to true crime podcasts or those docs on Netflix? Not really, no. Everything all right? What? don't know. Michael and Casey. What? just hope she's careful. Aren't you being a little too hard on them? What? have a bad feeling about him. What? hope you have a good feeling about me. Of course What? do. You're one of the girls. Let's pass these out. Here you go, ladies. It's on the house, OK? Enjoy. Thank you. Thanks. From the new baker up the street. Thank you. Don't do that. CASEY AND MICHAEL LAUGH You know how What? told you What? was worried that something happened to Beth? The florist? Mm-hm. Well, she was dating Michael when she left town. It explains why he's flirting with Casey. Michael seems so caring and attentive, but that's usually who's behind the murder, the caring and attentive husband. They weren't even married. They practically were, though. Hey. Hey, girl, hey. Hello. Wow, OK. All right. Cake after yoga? Mm-hm. OK. So, What? see the flirting continues. Mm-hm. Has he asked her out yet? No idea. She seems to really enjoy the attention. Nothing wrong with that. KNOCK ON DOOR Coming. Hey, I'm almost done. Come on in. I'm just neatening up. What's going on? My God, why are you wearing that? It's so hot. Did you try Lena's cake? It was so good. Oh, my God, I'm so glad she moved here. And you know what? She is so sweet. What? really like her. New tops in too. I'm actually wearing one right now. OK. What? hate putting furniture together. Come on, it's fun. It's like a puzzle. Lay all the pieces out. Where's the... the metal thing? What metal thing? The I-shaped metal stick? Oh, the Allen wrench? Should be in there. No. No? All right. We'll go to the hardware store. You work here? Hey. Yeah. Just for the summer. Cool. So, can you help us find Allen wrenches? And you don't have to jump over any aisles, though. Just give me a second. Hey, girls. What? don't recommend sneaking up on customers. I'm kind of like a ninja around here. You can call me Michael, Hardware Ninja. Follow me. Here they are. Maybe you should label things or something. Yeah. What? should get around to that, huh? You'll be able to find things. What? could probably find the time to do that... What size did you say you need again? What? brought the instructions. Looks like there might be a little puppy love between Charlie and your daughter, huh? Yeah, she's growing up way too fast. Here we go. One Allen key for one coffee table. Thank you. What? could come over and help you build that thing if you want? What? think I'm good. Girls can build things too. No, What? just meant... I'm saying all the wrong things today, aren't What?? No. You're good. Thanks for the help. Got to go. You're welcome. You're doing really well. Have you done yoga before? Not much. Are you enjoying the sessions? Definitely. What? was never able to get into crow, but now it just clicked when you said look in front of me and not down. That's the trick. Hey, where's Casey? We missed her energy today. She's usually always here on Tuesdays. I'm sure she'll be here tomorrow. What? should text her. OK. That is so cute. Thanks. What? do love coffee. Oh, What? heard that Charlie ran into you and your daughter at the hardware store. Yes, he did. Yeah, he came home and he was talking about how he thinks Ashley's kind of cute. Well, What? hear that he's a bit of a ladies' man. What? No. You can't believe that. He's never even had a real girlfriend. Speaking of ladies' men, What? hear that Michael likes to play the field a lot. Oh, What? almost forgot. What? did some digging into Michael's past last night. Heather... Check this out. He was a semi-pro fighter. He killed a guy during a fight. Heather, haven't we been through this enough? Michael's not a killer. Hey, ladies. Michael. Come on, let's go. I'm here for my one-on-one. What? don't mean to interrupt. Lena and What? were just leaving. Why don't you go ahead and put your things down over there and lay on the mat when you're ready? Sure. Right here OK? Yeah, that's perfect. Hey, can you text me when your session's over? Sure, why? What? just want to talk to you about something. Erm, OK. Let's go. Hey, Ashley. My ball went over the fence again. Do you mind getting it for me? Why don't you hop over the fence and get it yourself? What? mean, What? would, but you're sitting right there. That'd be rude. What? don't want to be rude. How bad of a basketball player do you have to be to keep losing your ball over the fence? Oh, I'm terrible. What? mean, I'm really bad. So, do you want to play a game or something? Yeah, let's do it. ASHLEY LAUGHS What? think you need more practice in the paint. OK, and you're not as bad as you say you are. What? was champion of my third grade basketball team. Oh, yeah? How do you like working at the hardware store? Er... What? don't. Then why do it? My mom wanted me to get a summer job, keep me out of trouble. Did you mean to throw the basketball over the fence? Maybe. You want to see my room? Hey, so I've got to show you something. OK. I'll meet you at the desk. You need a new hobby. What? found this in the alleyway behind Beth's shop a few clays after she went missing. You mean left town. Look, it's got initials on it. Beth gave this to Michael for his birthday. So he threw out a gift from his girlfriend after she left town. That's a pretty normal thing to do. What? think he used it to kill her, and then tried to get rid of it. By throwing it out behind her shop, literally with his name on it. And it's clean. Well, I'm sure he cleaned it after he killed her with it. Look, Heather, you are great, and What? am super thankful for your friendship, but you're being really weird about this. You know, she's been gone for a while. You're just torturing yourself. You need to let her go. She's dead. What? know she's dead. She would have said goodbye. Oh, hey, hey, it's OK. I'm sure Beth is fine. You're just overworked. What? see how many hours you're putting into this place. What? know it sounds crazy. What? just miss Beth a lot. What? know, but you just need a few extra hours of sleep, and cut out the murder TV and podcasts for a while. You know, what if What? asked Ashley if she would work here for a few clays a week? How's that sound? Yeah, that would help, actually. And maybe you could actually take a day off. Yeah. Put that away. HEATHER SIGHS Ashley, where are you? What? hope you're ready for Guthrie's best slice. Look what What? got! What? didn't hear you come in. That's because What? was going to surprise you. Hey, Mrs Mitchell. Charlie. Can Charlie stay for pizza? Maybe another time. What? should probably get going, anyway. OK, bye. I'll see you later. See you. Say hi to your mom. What? will. So, you want to watch that show about the pizza guy who straps a bomb to his chest? That's a bit dark, don't you think? Maybe. So, Heather just keeps pushing this murderer/conspiracy thing. What? don't get it. She's so broken up about her friend leaving town that she's making up stories now. What? changed my mind. What? think we should watch it for research. Oh, God! And Charlie help me set up the WiFi, so we're ready to stream whenever. Speaking of Charlie, you are way too young to have a boy in your room. We weren't doing anything. What? know, but What? am not comfortable with him being in there, especially when I'm not home. Why don't you just trust me? It's not that, honey. We... We just don't really know Charlie very well. I'm getting to know him. Look, next year, you're going to be in college. You can do whatever you want, but just take this last year in high school slow, for me. You just don't get it. What? do, actually. Don't. Heather, you alone? Maybe. What do you want? It's got to stop. What? don't know what you're talking about. The harassment. It's ridiculous. Well, isn't it true? It is not true! Isn't it true you killed someone? I've got to stop you. This is the last time I'm telling you - leave me alone. Or what? You'll be sorry. Wow. What was that about? He just wants me off his trail. What? need some tea. You want some tea? Yeah. Yeah, honey, I'd love some tea. So what's the latest? Besides that just now? Thank you. Breathe. Come on, you can tell me. What? know how you get all lathered up after listening to your podcasts. This thing with Michael - it's not because YOU have a crush on him, is it? Absolutely not! What? told Lena about the hammer thing. Oh, God. That nonsense. What did she say? Same thing you did. Serial killers aren't that dumb. You feel better now? No. Casey's still missing. Look, maybe she just needed some time to herself. Should we contact her family? No, What? don't think it's that serious. She just wouldn't disappear like this, you know? She's too polite, too trusting. What? know she got herself in trouble somehow. The polite and trusting ones always do. What? think you need to switch to decaf. So this is a hip flexor. Child's pose. So widen out your knees, and sit back on your heels. Yeah, that's good. Great job. Reach your fingertips towards the top of the classroom. In through your nose, out through your mouth. Beautiful job. Great. Now, when you're ready, we're going to come up onto all fours, and we're going to do lion's breath. Simhasana pranayama. So we're all going to take a deep inhale through our nose, and on the exhale, you stick out your tongue, and release the breath with an "Aah" sound. Ready? SHE INHALES DEEPLY Aah! THEY COPY HER Now we're going to transition into everybody's favourite - corpse pose. So get comfortable on your backs. Snuggle your shoulders underneath you. Open your palms, and let your feet fall wherever they do. And take this moment to really thank your body. Only rise when your body compels you to. Thank you. My pleasure. Thanks. Mm-hm. What? just want to say, What? really found my breath today. Oh, fantastic, Atticus. Namaste. Namaste. There you are. Incredible. Great class, Jenny. I'm so glad that you enjoyed it. So What? caught Charlie and Ashley in her bedroom last night. Oh! I'm not super happy about it. Did you... Did you talk to Ashley about it? Yeah, What? did. What? hope you've talked to Charlie about boundaries with girls. Yes. Oh, my God. You don't have to worry about Charlie. Honestly, he's a very, very sweet, very sensitive young man. OK. Yeah. By the way, how is Ashley adjusting to the move? She's good. You know, just a little bored. Oh. Well, you know, What? don't know if she'd be interested, but What? could use a little help around here if she's into, like, maybe a part-time job. I'll ask her when What? get home tonight. OK. Great. Yeah. Call me, let me know. All right. Talk to you later. OK, bye. Thank you. It was delicious. Oh, thanks so much. Have a great day! SHE GASPS HE LAUGHS Scared me, again. What? told you, I'm pretty sneaky. Hardware ninja. What? forgot. That's right! What can What? get you? Er... So What? know What? shouldn't do this, but What? just had to have one of your delicious treats after my burger. What? have a really great cake today, so why don't you have a seat? I'll bring you a slice over. Okey dokey. Enjoy. Thanks. Hey, you wanna join me? I'm sorry. I'm kind of busy right now. You aren't trying to avoid me, are you? What? guess What? can spare a few minutes. Mm. This cake is amazing. Listen. What? know things have been a bit weird around here lately, but What? want you to know What? had nothing to do with any of this. Any of what? Do What? really have to say it? What? know what you're talking about. And... there's something else. What's that? I've done a lot of work to clear my name over the years. What? tried really hard to make up for my past. But I'm not perfect. It's OK. No, hear me out. Heather showed me the headline. So you can understand why I'm here, then? People make it really hard to start over. Everyone's running from something. Are we? My husband passed away from cancer and... after that, What? just couldn't go back to my old life. Lena, I'm so sorry. What? need to go back to work. OK. Thanks again for the cake. You're welcome, hardware ninja! That's my dad and me on a fishing trip. It was like a year before he got sick. He looks really nice. He was. What? wish my dad was nice. At least you have a dad. What? don't. He walked out on us. One day he just went to work and never came back. I'm so sorry. My mom says that he's got this new family somewhere but What? wouldn't know. Well, maybe Michael can be your new stepdad. You're hilarious, but... What? don't think he likes my mom like that. Do you trust him? What do you mean? What? trust you. You do? What? didn't say how much. How was your clay? Mom, we weren't even in my room. What? didn't just mean your room. What? meant being alone in the house at all. How was What? supposed to know that? You just were. That's such crap! Now you're just making the rules up as you go along. What? am not. And please don't talk to me like that. You don't know what it's like for your dad to die. When people ask about my parents... What? try to avoid it. What? just want to say, "Oh, my mom and me," because it's easier to pretend that it's always been that way. Charlie does the same thing. He's the only one that understands what I'm going through. I'm sorry. What? miss Dad, too. What? really, really miss him. Do you think it's ready yet? Let's check. What? think it needs another couple of minutes. OK. What? need you to make a decision on this part time job thing. Is it going to be Jenny's or Heather's? Jenny is Charlie's mom, right? Uh-huh. What? think What? want to work at the yoga studio. Of course you do. All right. What? will call Jenny tomorrow and tell her you'll stop by the studio. KNOCK ON DOOR Finish the pasta and the sauce. Michael, what are you doing here? What? realised that What? did not properly welcome you to town, so welcome. Thank you. That's awfully nice of you. So my daughter and What? are just getting ready to eat. Ooh! Pasta. Mom, aren't you going to invite him in? Yeah. No. No, it's OK. What? was joking. You are more than welcome to. Really? Really. Hey, Casey, it's Heather. No need to call me back. I'm in the boutique in case the security company calls you. You don't have cameras, do you? What? hope you're alive. That's a lot of bleach. That's definitely blood. Jenny! jenny, What? need you at the boutique right now. Plus it was really funny. That's really sweet. Isn't my mom the best? She certainly sounds like it. OK, well, I've had enough adult romance. Hey. I'm going to bed. Goodnight, honey. She seems like such a great kid. She is. Can What? ask you something personal? Anything. About Beth? Beth... How did you guys meet? What? like these. OK, great. It's a nice spot you got here. Oh, thank you. Thank you. I'm pretty proud of my shop. Yeah, this town seems like a perfect place to open my own business, finally. SO hopefully business will go well. What? don't know, maybe I'll settle down. What? hope you do. And some of these. Great. Well, this is a very nice array of blooms. I'm sure your wife will be very happy. Yeah, they're for my mother, it's her birthday. Oh, OK. No wife? No wife. Girlfriend? Mm-mm. Oh, OK. Well, I'll just go make these up. All right. We were pretty serious. What? asked her to move in with me. What did she say? That she'd think about it. Then she sent me a text saying that she's leaving town one day. She sends you a text? She didn't do it in person? No. What do you think that is? What? don't know. Maybe she dropped a bottle of nail polish. When blood dries, it looks like that, right? Heather. Really? You smell that? It smells like bleach. It does. Why would she need bleach? Honey, you're letting your imagination run away with you again. Nobody is dead. I'm gonna call the cops. You're gonna call the cops and tell them what? That Casey texted me and told me she's with her dad? And, Beth, look, What? loved Beth just like you loved Beth, but you remember her and she was flaky and flighty. Don't you see a pattern here? No, What? don't. I'm sorry. What? don't see a pattern. But what What? do see is that you are sick. You need to go home and you need to get some rest. All right? What? was going to find our friend. Heather, please. OK? Go home. What's going to happen if you get too sick to work? You're pushing yourself too hard. So, please, for me, will you please go home and get some rest? OK. OK. I'm gonna get some soup. What? don't like soup. Have you heard Heather's conspiracy theory? Which one? That Beth was disappeared. She won't quit, will she? Can't people just stop talking about her leaving? What? mean, it's hard enough to get by in life without being the subject of town gossip, you know. It must be difficult. She did find her hammer with your initials. It was a gift, and What? tossed it. What? haven't looked back since. Just so you know, What? don't believe the rumours. Don't you? Yeah. Thanks. Well, at least not most of them. So job's yours if you want it. Thank you so much. Yeah. When do you think you might want to start? How about right now? OK. OK. You think you're ready? What? was born ready. What? like it. That's a good attitude. All right. Well, the cleaning supplies are right here. OK. And What? usually start off by sweeping. OK. Yeah. So how's your mom doing? She adjusting OK? Everybody around here has been, you know, a little bit on edge lately. Yeah, What? think she's OK. She had a guy over for dinner last night. It was nice to see her smile like that again. She hasn't done that since my dad was around. Who is the guy? It was weird, he sort of just showed up unannounced. It was the guy from the hardware store. Michael? Mm-hm, yeah. What? think they had a lot of fun. Look pretty cute in that sweatshirt. Zip it up, you'd be a goth. What? don't want that, What? guess. Better take it off. Thanks for lunch. What? really appreciate that. Yeah. No problem, Charlie. Listen, Charlie. What? know your mom's not around much. She's doing her best to pay the bills. She cares more about her stupid classes than me, but... The world can be a tough place, Charlie. Especially without your parents around. You're a good kid. You really are. You're the first person to ever call me that. That feels weird. Well, you are! What? want you to know if... you ever want to talk about things or you ever need someone... I'll be around for you, all right? It's getting mushy now, so... Knock you out. Lena. You're tenacious, aren't you? What? don't know what that means. You don't give a girl a break. Would you like to have dinner with me? just the two of us alone. Oh. What? realised this morning What? just sort of invited myself into your house last night. Could What? make it up to you by taking you out? Michael, What? think you're a really nice guy. What? just don't know if I'm ready for romance yet. You know, I'm just still trying to figure out what my life is and start over. Don't blame me for trying. You change your mind, you know where to find me. What? will go out with you. Really? Yes. It's been a year. What? can go out on one date. Fantastic! I'll pick you up at eight. DOOR OPENS Hey, Heather. Hey. I'm just finishing up. You want some tea? Yeah, yeah. Your iced tea looks really good. Sure. Thanks. So how's the detective business going? Well, What? am piecing it all together. Here. Thanks. OK. So Beth decided to stay and someone killed her for it. And then someone didn't like that Casey and Michael were getting so close and now Casey is gone. But you said yourself the Casey and Michael were just friends, right? And that Casey didn't even like him in that way? So that theory is no good. You were close with both of them. Did they ever tell you anything about feeling threatened, or in danger or...? No. Never. You're not interested in Michael, are you? Heather, listen. You should really just leave this alone. You know, before you get hurt. Get hurt? What do you know that What? don't? OK. See? This is exactly what I'm talking about, you're going over the edge. Jenny, I'm fine. No, you're not. Your behaviour is borderline psychotic. What? don't appreciate the way you're talking to me. Well, I'm sorry. It's the truth. OK? You're on some crusade, strictly for your own entertainment, and you're ruining someone's life in the process. You don't even seem to care. You're a coffee shop owner. OK? You're not a detective. And, frankly, you're embarrassing yourself. You're embarrassing your friends. Jenny, I'm just trying to find our friends, OK? I'm trying to... OK, OK, OK. What? didn't mean that. I'm sorry. Just drop it. No promises. That should do it. SHE GASPS Are you nervous? A little. All right. I'm really nervous. Do you think he changed his mind? No. Trust me. He likes you. KNOCK ON DOOR For you. Thank you. You're welcome. Is this too dressy? Should What? change? You look amazing. Really. Thank you. Of course. Oh, sorry. What? totally forgot that I've already brought you some. But that's what you're supposed to do, right? That's OK. Thank you. Sorry, I'm late. Are you OK? You're a little flustered. No, What? just had a customer show up to the shop. What? know how that is. Should we go? Yeah! Have her home by midnight, please. Yes, ma'am. You have fun. Pizza's in the fridge. And remember... What? know - no house guests. Thank you. Shall we? What? have never had pulled pork like that in my life. Pretty amazing, isn't it? Words cannot describe. Hey, I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry, it's me. I'm not used to that. It's gonna take me a little bit to get to the hand thing. No problem. All right? What? get it. It's OK. You're a really good mother, you know that? Not a lot of people could have gone through what you went through and stayed as strong. Sometimes What? feel like I'm the teenager. She's the one who pushed me to go out tonight. You needed somebody to push you? My rugged charm wasn't enough for you? No, What? don't mean it like that. Maybe she could push you to see a movie tomorrow. Got some Chevy Chase movies going on... No! Yeah. It's only ten miles from here. I'd love to. Yeah? Yeah. Awesome. They got Twizzlers, your favourite! How can What? say no? Hey, Lena, you haven't seen Heather, have you? No. Isn't the shop open? We've been waiting here for a half hour. What? have some tea over at my place if you guys are interested? Yeah, that'd be great. All right, I'll meet you guys over there. You're welcome. You're welcome. You got any more of that cake? What? have a fresh batch resting right behind the counter. Cool. All right. Let's go. What? think I'm finished with the floors. Oh. Do they look OK? Erm, let's take a look. Yeah. Great. Great work. So now you can just take this and put it back in that storeroom that What? showed you and then we've got a couple of minutes. So come on back and we can take a break and chat. MESSAGE ALERT ls there anything else What? can do? No, not right now, honey. When Michael gets here, What? can show you how to check students into the computer. What did you and your mom do last night? Nothing. What? ate pizza and watched a movie. She went out. Wow, busy lady. Yeah. With who? Michael. Again? Mm-hm. Those rumours about him, they don't... they don't bother you? Not really. My dad always said that talk is cheap. I'm just glad that she's finally getting out. She says that they're just friends but What? can tell that he likes her. Is she serious about him? What? don't know. What? mean, she's not a casual dater, even before she met my dad. They always said that she was the hardest lady to date in LA, and then he convinced her to go on a first date, and the rest is history. Hey, Mom. Hi, monkey! Hi! What time does... Ashley get off? How about now? Really? Yeah. You guys, you go ahead, you go and enjoy the sunshine. Cool. Yeah. Thanks. Namaste, Ashley. Hey, jenny. Everything OK at the studio? Yeah, yeah. What? just figured I'd pop by and say hello. What's that? What? found them out back in the parking lot. Do you recognise them? No. Should What?? Look at the coffee cup. What? think their Heather's. What? So how long you been dating Michael? What? wouldn't say that we're dating. So you just slept with him? Jenny, that's not really any of your business. Are you gonna see him again? We're planning on going to a movie tonight. But now... What? don't know, What? think I'm just gonna cancel. That's good. He's not really your type anyway, is he? How would you know what my type is? Because What? know your kind. My kind? Yeah. Yeah. You've breezed from a big city like some wounded bird to a small town, looking for people to help you. Is that right? What? figured What? would just come by and give you a little friendly advice. He's not yours. You should just stay away from him. Do you hear me? What? hear you. That's really good. I'm going to give these to Heather. You... You should probably just go back to wherever you came from. I'm fine right where What? am. Not for long. Lena! SHE SCREAMS Oh! Oh! oh, my God! What? haven't been hit that hard... Good shot. You're lucky that's all you got. Thanks. So what's the deal with you and Jenny? Not sure what you mean. She came over here today on a rampage. She's just a friend. A friend that gives you private yoga lessons? She likes to do that because What? gave her son a job, just to repay a favour, sort of thing. That's right. You also work with her son. You know, What? am not one of these girls that you could just gaslight. What? swear, Lena, nothing's going on. You're the only one What? care about. Well, tell that to Jenny. Because I'm done. We're done. You can find some other girl... Come on, Lena, don't be like that. You know, I'm not feeling very well. What? can't make it. That's OK. Don't. Don't touch me. Lena. And What? think you should go. OK. Your legs look... They look good in the water. SHE GIGGLES They only look good in the water? No, What? mean, they look good outside of the water, but they look good... You know... I'll take it. OK, good! Just take it and run with it, please. Oh, my gosh. ROTARY PHONE-STYLE RINGTONE Oh, one sec, it's my mom. Wow, that's a pretty old-school ring. Hi. Where are you? Look, do me a favour and go home. I'll be there soon. Come on, Mom, we're not even inside. Ashley, just go home, please. What? don't want to hear it. So annoying. You OK? Yeah, nothing. You know you can tell me anything, right? What? know. Thanks. That's good. OK. We're going to do one more deep breath. Really get a good stretch. Yeah. And now, we're going to settle into... Shavasana. That's real good. You know, erm... I think Charlie's always secretly hoped that you and What? would get together. Really? Yeah. What? just think he really admires you. You know? What? even think that he got a little angry when he thought you were dating Casey. Casey's just a friend. I'd rather he doesn't think I'm Ted Bundy, like everyone else. What? know you could never hurt anybody. Yeah. Well, What? have. Do you want to talk about it? No. Definitely not. It's just that, you know, What? mean, if there was ever anything that What? could do? What? mean, you've been such a great father figure to Charlie, and... What? mean, you know that his dad isn't in our lives any more. What? know. What? feel bad for Charlie. Every kid needs a father. I just... What? don't know what we would do without you. I'm not going anywhere. OK? What a gentleman. So, same time tomorrow? Yes, ma'am. Great. Hey, are you sure What? can't pay you for the class? Oh, no, no. What? can't take your money. Not after everything you've done for Charlie and me. Thanks, Jen. Let me know if you change your mind. And in the meantime, if you need any hardware solutions... Yeah. I'm your guy. Yes, you are. There it is. How's it going at the hardware store? You know, it's pretty slow. Is Michael still trying to be your dad? What's your deal with him? What do you mean? What? mean, you don't seem to like him much. What? like that he's into my mom. But What? have a bad feeling about him. All the women in this town are obsessed with him. Yeah, my mom included. Really? It's annoying and it's embarrassing. She's always texting him and giving him these free yoga lessons. Oh, no. What? What's wrong? What? told her that my mom and Michael went on a date. Really? Yeah, now What? feel like a jerk. Sure it's not a big deal, so. Did you know that he killed someone? Yeah, he told me. It's why he moved here. Wow, OK, so it is true. Apparently, he just hit someone so hard, he died. But it was in the boxing ring, so. Yeah, but that's really strong. It's a hazard of the job, What? don't know what to say. He probably has a temper. What? don't think so. What? mean, What? work with him and he seems pretty nice. Or is he hiding something? CAR LOCKS KNOCKING Heather! It's Lena! KNOCKING Heather? CAT MEOWS You here? ALARM BLARES ALARM STOPS So you're telling me that you just decided to break into your new friend's house? What? didn't break in, What? used the key under the mat. Oh, oh. Is this your house? No, but What? didn't break in. Did Heather instruct you to use the key and open the door? No. Honey, you broke in. She didn't show up to her coffee shop today. And What? found her keys in the alley next to the dumpster. Don't tell me that, you're digging a deeper hole for yourself! You just told me you found them under the mat. That florist just disappeared over a year ago. And then Casey just up and leaves a few clays ago. Heather was worried that something happened to both of them, and now she's gone too. You're starting to sound just like Heather. You can't let that woman get to you, she's paranoid. What? thought she was paranoid too, but maybe she's on to something. Listen, Jenny came storming into my shop today, threatened me, and took Heather's keys. I've known jenny her whole life, she ain't the sort. Did you reach out to Heather? What? can't get her on the phone. But she texted me. If she contacted you, why are you trying to make me think she's missing? Well, if she's sick, why isn't she at home? Listen, there is something wrong here. Please just... do your job. Don't disrespect me, Lena. I'm the law in this town. Look, What? know you're much new here, so I'm going to give you a pass. Better yet, this is what I'll do - I'll do some snooping around town, OK? But if What? find out that everything is in order, you've just got to stop this fantasy, it's ridiculous. You're sounding like Heather. What? promise, What? will. Good. And no more breaking into your friends' houses, all right? Deal See you soon. All right. Ashley? Ashley, you here? Ash? Ashley, you here? You here? Ugh. Hello? Anyone home? Oh! Oh, jenny, hi. Do you always break into your neighbour's home? The door was open. What? need to speak with Ashley. Yeah, sure, she's in the back yard. Come on, this way. What? was going to have a glass of wine, do you want one? No, erm... Thanks for letting Ashley stay here. Oh, of course. By the way, What? was going to tell you, What? saw Heather and she's fine. You saw her? Well, What? mean, What? talked to her. On the phone? Yeah. Yeah, why? Did you say where she is? She's going to stay with her aunt. For a little while. That cold that she has, What? guess it's taken a really bad turn to the flu. That's what Hank thought. Did you go to the police? No, but the old drunk almost arrested me. Hey, Mrs Mitchell. Charlie. Mom, can we stay for dinner? Ashley, What? told you to go home. Well, What? was going to, but then you came here first. Why don't we just let the kids play for a while? Besides, there's something I'd really like to talk to you about. Go home, Ashley. Please, can What? stay? No. I'm not leaving, you are being so unfair. Ashley. Ash! She doesn't even care about what What? want. This whole move has just been for her. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, OK? Mikey, Mikey, Mikey, how you doing? Hey, Hank. Good to see you, buddy, I'm glad you're open late. Ready to throw back a few, huh? More ready than you could possibly imagine. Boy, have What? had a day. You wouldn't believe me if What? told you. I'm sorry What? asked, and don't tell me. OK, What? won't. You guys having some trouble at home? Just normal kid stuff. Can What? use your rest room? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course. If you go right around that corner, it's the first door on the right. MICHAEL SIGHS What? ever tell you about the time What? Took down a stag with my bare hands? Yeah, I'd say What? heard that about six or seven times, give or take a couple. Yeah, but What? Found the soft spot in the skull... What? know the story well. What the hell happened to your lip? Ah... Lena hit me with a broom. These girls are nuts. What? swear, Hank, What? really thought we had something good going, man. Till the broom hit you in the face and told you otherwise. Yeah, What? don't buy it, man. What the...? What am What? doing? Is everything OK? Yeah, just knocked something over. Well, come on in here. Come, sit. So, how did your date with Michael go? What date? Don't be coy. What? meant it when What? said What? was sorry about the other day. What? was... l was overprotective of a friend. I'd really like to make amends. To a fresh start. Oh! It must be corked. It's fine. It's really very good. So, what did you do on your date? You know, it's getting late, What? think we should be going. No, no, no, let the... let the kids play. Did Michael kiss you? I'm sorry, What? have to take care of something real fast. You know, What? was really surprised that you agreed to go out with him to begin with, considering what Heather told you about him. MESSAGE SENDS Did you guys get to first base? I'll tell you about that another time. We should go fishing next week, you know. Grab some beer, smoke a cigar. Yeah, maybe. MESSAGE ALERT What? told you those girls were nuts. Naw. Hey, come on, man. SHE GIGGLES Ha-ha! OK, wait, What? should go. What? feel bad. Yeah? What? haven't yelled at my mom like that in so long. OK. Or... maybe just one more game? Well, let me see what she says. Sure. I'm sorry What? freaked out. We can go now, if you want. I'll just meet you at home. Jenny, What? just have to run a quick errand. Is everything OK? Yeah! You kids just have fun. That was weird. Winner's ball. Oh! OK. That's sweet, that's real good. Which one's your car? Where are we going?
