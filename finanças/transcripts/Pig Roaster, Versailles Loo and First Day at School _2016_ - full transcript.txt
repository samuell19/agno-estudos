(light music) - [Narrator] Like many Brits, engineer Dick Strawbridge and his wife, designer Angel, had dreams of living in France. (Dick speaks in a foreign language) But, where most people might settle for a modest little bolthole, the couple fell under the spell of a fairy-tale chateau. - Oh! - Wow, look at that! - [Angel] Well, I think we should put an offer in now. (women laughing) - This is truly beautiful. (majestic sweeping music) - [Narrator] What's more, they could afford it. The chateau, with its 45 rooms, 12 acres, seven outbuildings and even a moat, came with a with an irresistible price tag of just 280,000 pounds - Thank you very much indeed. - Congratulations, eh. (gentle music) - [Narrator] Then reality set in. - [Dick] Turn, turn, turn, turn. Wow. - [Narrator] What they'd bought was a derelict monument to a forgotten era of grand, country-house living. - Look at the sewage, look at the electrics in here. You look at the lead paint. 200 plus pages of reasons not to buy house - [Narrator] They only had a fraction of the money they needed to do it up. (drill whirring) Reviving the chateau has taken more courage and more graft than they ever thought possible. - [Dick] What's coming off here is all the lead, and it's all wet, it's going to my bucket (majestic music) - [Narrator] Now, 18 months since moving in, they're facing the biggest challenge of their lives. Just how can they afford to keep their French dream alive? (majestic music) It's high summer in the Pays de la Loire and time to mow the front lawn at the Chateau de la Motte Husson. For Dick, that means doing a deal with the local farmer. - Nicholas has come to cut our grass. It's not for love, it's not for money, it's because he actually wants the hay. All this is gonna be food. So, he's got as a freebie. So I get a free mowing of my lawn. - [Narrator] Bartering in favors are the way the French like to do business in this rural area of France. It's the way Dick likes to do business, too. - It's not that I'm tight, but who wants to pay to have your grass cut? Just before our wedding last year, I got the grass cut so it looked good. Cost me 200 euros. Arthur, Arthur, Arthur come here. Dodo, come here. - [Narrator] And for the family, it's a whole new playground. - [Angel] It was only a couple of years ago that he wouldn't even put his feet on AstroTurf. (laughs) - Wouldn't touch it. Now, we've actually got there. I've turned him into a country boy. Urgh, come on! The kids are happy. Angela and I are happy. Allin all, the quality of life, our lives here, I smile a lot. I smile. I'm very happy. - Whoa now! - [Dick] Yes, hay! - Oh, God. Probably one of the reasons why Dick and I love each other because we just both go for things and don't worry about it too much. No. (yells) - [Dick] Mummy's not quite a country girl yet. - I got him. If you think about it too much, and you think about what could go wrong or what could happen if, if, if, if, then you just don't do stuff. (intense music) - [Narrator] And over the last 18 months, they've begun to make big changes. (angle grinder whirring) - Mate, I got it. - Yeah. - [Narrator] From rewiring to installing central heating. - Heat! - [Narrator] To creating an entire, new septic system. And nine main rooms got their first face-lift in nearly half a century. But that leaves 36 rooms that are virtually untouched. And they're still missing the basics. - I had to be really quite brutal and sort of say, what has to be done, as opposed to what would you like to have done. And the must-dos are our getting a cloakroom at this level, because, you know, if you come to our house and you want to go to the loo, you can either go out to the shed outside or go up several flights of stairs. We have to do the must-dos first. (gentle music) - [Narrator] They've picked a jaded beauty of a room at the back of the chateau, looking out over the moat. It has a grand, 15-foot-high ceiling and Angel wants to create a mini Versailles, with an aviary of stuffed birds perched on the toilet cubicles. - Cubicles are gonna go here, and we've had a lot of debate over how high the cubicles should go up to, because I'd quite like a ceiling on my cubicle. I know it's a personal thing, but. (laughing) The biggest thing is just getting started and getting that vision. And me and Dick agreeing (laughs) on where stuff can go and how ridiculous I'm allowed to be. I'm looking forward to having a pee in here. (upbeat music) - [Narrator] Dick and Angel have taken on the mammoth task of renovating the chateau almost entirely by themselves, calling on master builder Steve to do the specialist jobs. - Couldn't wish to come and work at a better place, could you? - [Narrator] Steve gets to work in the new downstairs 100 with a bit of dot and dab by gluing the plasterboard to the old walls to create a smoother surface. (gentle majestic music) As always, spending is at the forefront of their minds. There's no pot of gold to throw into construction, so they will have to be inventive, and there's no better source of inspiration than the attic. - It's interesting, they were going to clear it out for us. The family were going to clear it out and just bin everything. We said, "No, just leave it. "It's okay, we'll do it." Couldn't believe our luck. (gentle music) - [Narrator] The estate had been in the Baglioni family for 400 years when they sold it to Dick and Angel. 18 months on the chateau us still sharing its secrets. - Just look, I love that they've got a fashion bit on here. Look how gorgeous she looks. Love it, absolutely love it. Do you know I like about these magazines? I like all the advertising. - [Dick] Yes, it is interesting, yes. - [Angel] But how beautiful is that? I mean, that would just be so sought-after now, wouldn't it? - Or scrapped, I don't know. Depends, do you know it I mean? - Do know it I'm thinking? I've got to get a couple of doors for the cloakroom? - The two cubicles, yeah. - Yeah, do you remember I did the decoupage of the old French magazines? Maybe we should do something similar? It would get people something to read on the toilet. - Won't take many of those to do a loo, will it? - [Angel] You'll be surprised, actually. Yeah, I reckon about 10. - 10? - Yeah. - [Dick] That could be 50 quid! What? You realize we haven't even been in the dark corners yet? - [Angel] I know! (gentle music) - [Narrator] In the 19th century, the chateau's owners would have fed an entire family and staff from its kitchen garden, or potager. Now, it's hidden somewhere under the weeds and brambles. Dick and Angel have been unearthing it little by little, though the wilderness hasn't given up just yet. - [Dick] Every time I come in here, I'm very aware there's masses to do. It's always bad when the weeds are taller than you. But their hopes and hard work are beginning to pay off. That is a Victoria plum. It's in. That's a nectarine. It's in. The vines are in. We'll just keep clearing away, the roots'll get strong and then next year when they grow up against the wall and they make the most of the heat coming in here, this is the hottest part of the garden, then this will be really productive. - [Angel] What have you got, babe? - Potato! - [Angel] Potato! Right. - [Narrator] Now it's August, at the end of a long, hot summer, and they've already been able to pick a feast of fruit and vegetables. - [Dick] Who'd like to eat a tomato? - Arthur, Arthur. - One, one, one! One. Oops! Pick 'em up, pick 'em up, we don't wanna lose them. Pick it up, Dodo, pick it up. We've always planned to get the garden back in control and to sort of get-- - Let Mommy hold it. - A serious amount of harvest from it. - There would've been a team of people looking after the garden and we don't have that yet. I say yet. (chuckles) One day, we'd like to. - Too heavy. - It's too heavy? Oh, you've got a raspberry in there and a little courgette and a potato, and it's too heavy? Feet up. - Come on! Come on, welly people. (speaks gibberish) Hello, ladies. - [Narrator] They're still keeping chickens, which are laying well. (gentle music) (chickens clucking) - [Dick] Girls. - [Narrator] They've also added three pigs to their menagerie, Chunky, Tufty and Stumpybum. - You know, they know you're coming. You can hear them start going, "Hmm, hmm," first thing in the morning as I'm coming up the driveway to come and feed them, and they just know you're there. They're so inquisitive. They go around, they'll find. If you give them a football, they'll play with it. I just love keeping pigs. (water sloshing) It's bath time, enjoy, girls. (gentle majestic music) - [Narrator] The French, rural idyll is all very well, but it won't pay for itself. They're banking on being able to put the chateau to work as an event venue, and there's been some good news. Angel has a big booking. - The logistics are, (puffing) they're mind-blowing. So, it's our first wedding, it's 80 people, it's three days of festivities. (laughs) I'm not worried about me and Dick. I'm more worried about the house supporting the guests. So, I've got everything crossed. (laughing) (gentle music) - [Narrator] So, in six weeks' time, they'll be hosting their first, big, paying event. But the downstairs loo has barely even started and already there's a problem. - That's really high. - [Dick] But if you try and do something above that, it's a hell of a big space to fill. - Yeah, but I can have some hanging bits. How much work is that for Steve to bring that down? - I'm not telling him. I'm not telling Steve. - Well, just a sensible, to tie in to anything, just a sensible level. - [Dick] Well, what is a sensible level? - [Angel] I don't know, darling. - Right. (majestic music) - [Narrator] There are 40,000 chateaux across France. They're synonymous with the country's aristocratic past. One of the finest examples is the 16th century Villandry, near Tours. It's a two-hour drive from Dick and Angel. They've come to check out how the other half live. - [Angel] I mean that's-- - [Dick] I'm never going to do it, I'm never gonna do it. Don't even think it. - I mean, that's quite a sexy rake, though, isn't it? And it makes straight lines. I mean, anything can make straight lines, but-- - [Dick] Next thing you know, you'll want a stripy lawn. - [Angel] Oh, but I do want a stripy lawn. - [Dick] Darling, we're never gonna have a stripy lawn. - [Narrator] It's the envy of horticulturalists all around the world. - I like a cabbage flower. - [Narrator] It has 10 full-time gardeners to keep its borders in check. - [Dick] Look at the size of those tomatoes! (Dick speaks in foreign language) (man speaks in foreign language) (Dick speaks in foreign language) - Ladybird? (Dick speaks in foreign language) (man speaks in foreign language) (Dick speaks in foreign language) - You buy ladybirds in the post to eat your black flies? - Oh, no way! (Dick speaks in foreign language) - [Narrator] Dick and Angel's visit is a reminder of just how much upkeep these estates need, and the long journey they've embarked on to make their own chateau viable, and that they're going to have to do everything on limited funds. (gentle upbeat music) 150 meters away from the chateau is the orangery. Once, it was the pride and joy of the estate, where tropical flowers were grown and guests were entertained. Dick has his sights on using it as a banqueting hall for events, including the wedding in one month's time, but as usual, it's not straightforward. - [Dick] We are lacking some utilities, water, electricity, and it's far too expensive to put them in over here. - [Narrator] The solution has been beating down on them all along, Dick is going solar. - [Dick] We need power to make noise, for the party factor, and we need some lighting, that's all. And what's not to like about free electricity? - [Narrator] Run the solar panel for a week, and it will generate enough electricity for the wedding celebrations. Dick just needs to get some batteries, and find them a suitable home. - First time I've been up here. (chuckles) Nice and dry. - [Narrator] Step one is to run a cable from the solar panel and through the old slate roof. - [Dick] Come on. You're either gonna get a beam, or you aren't gonna get a beam. Very pleasantly surprised. Positive and negative. - [Narrator] Step two will be to connect it to three large, deep cycle batteries. - [Dick] And, of course, the sun's shining out there now, so I'm just, the faster I get this done, the faster I'm gonna get free electricity. The whole place makes you want to scratch. (gentle upbeat music) - [Narrator] Meanwhile, down below, Angel has a big challenge of her own, she wants to revamp her charity shop dining chairs, all 80 of them. - Some of them have this, very popular chair in France, like this rattan, and it's just not good for a lady's dress at a wedding. Bought a high-density foam. This has got to support one's (beeps). I found this beautiful material online. It's gonna cost, say, 5 pound per chair. You know, for a tenner a chair, we're gonna have something lovely. (gentle upbeat music) (staple gun thudding) - [Narrator] But that's 10 by 80, which will take a big bite out of their profit. - Oh, that's quite comfy. - [Narrator] The investment will be worth it if the business takes off. (gentle music) The solar panels and cables are now in position. Dick just needs to collect the batteries from the nearby town of Mayenne. Off the tourist route, it's rare for anyone to speak English here. When Dick first came to France, his French was very rudimentary. (relaxed music) - The last time I studied French was 39 years ago. (Dick speaks in foreign language) - [Narrator] He often had to improvise. (both speak in foreign language) - (laughs) Okay. We're going to have a (speaks in foreign language). - [Narrator] But his language skills are improving. (shopkeeper speaks in foreign language) (Dick speaks in foreign language) (shopkeeper speaks in foreign language) - [Dick] Okay. (speaks in foreign language) - [Narrator] So far, so good. - I'm picking up more and more technical words as I need them, and that's the best part. And I always look up some words before I come out shopping. (Dick speaks in foreign language) (shopkeeper speaks in foreign language) Okay. (shopkeeper speaks in foreign language) (Dick laughing) (Dick speaks in foreign language) (shopkeeper speaks in foreign language) (Dick speaks in foreign language) - [Narrator] Dick wants deep cycle batteries, which can be recharged over and over. Run truck batteries down too often, and they're useless. (Dick speaks in foreign language) (shopkeeper speaks in foreign language) Not only have the wrong batteries been ordered, but the correct ones are twice as expensive. - Same price as the UK. (groaning) Oh, my heart! - [Narrator] But Dick has to cough up if the batteries are going to be delivered in time for the wedding to have sound and light. - [Dick] Well, merci! (gentle majestic music) - [Narrator] Steve has been persuaded to cut the cubicles to size, and his plasterwork has drawn an audience. - Who needs television, is what I say. - [Narrator] But however much finessing is going on above, someone has to do the dirty work down below. - [Dick] Of course, it's never easy. (drill whirring) (gentle music) - [Narrator] Between floors, there is 19th century insulation called cobs. Packed together between the beams, the straw and mud bundles dampen noise and keep the heat in. The chateau extends to five floors. It can fit nine average British houses within its three-foot-thick walls. Every job is super-sized and complicated. - All of our loos, when they flush, they all come down and join our waste pipes that go along the back of the chateau, through the curve out through, and joining our septic tank outside the chateau. What I have to do now is, in the back where Angela wants our two new loos, I have to put pipe in that comes and joins this. That pipe has to have the same gradient as all the rest, which is an inch a yard, or 25 mils per meter, and that means when we flush, it comes in and it joins, it'll go all the way through our existing system and go out to our septic tank. - [Narrator] It sounds good on paper, but will it work in practice? (pipe thudding) (gentle upbeat music) - [Dick] Every time you do it waste pipes, you do everything two or three times, it's just the way of it. (groans) (wood clattering) - [Narrator] It's going to take all Dick's talent for persuasion. (hammer thudding) All the pipes will eventually be boxed in. If he's miscalculated, the whole lot will have to come out again. (gentle music) When this chateau was built by the Baglion family in the 1870s, there was no scrimping. Everything, from the wrought iron staircase to the hand-painted wallpaper, was bespoke. Angel is using an even older craft from the 17th century, to decorate the new loo doors. - Decoupage, if that's how you say it. Been around forever. Anyone that's a little bit crafty will have done it at some point, you know. If you've got a bit of patience, you've got some interesting material to cover something with. You know, we've got these amazing magazines that are here in the house, and we've got two dead cheap doors. (giggles) So it just seemed a bit silly not to do it. (gentle majestic music) - [Narrator] She's creating a collage using vintage magazines that they found in the attic. Glue sticks the paper, and a first coat of clear varnish gives it a hard covering. - Round one, done. It's looking all right, isn't it? (relaxed music) - [Narrator] Dick's been to fetch the new batteries for the orangery, and this time, they're right. Or so he hopes. - The other side of those slates is my solar panel, pointing nearly south, and that's going to give me the electricity I need to keep these batteries full. Angela wants it perfect because these are her customers, and she's a perfectionist. I use a hammer and nails, and she wants dovetail joints. It's a marriage made in heaven. - [Narrator] Everything will be sweetness and light, if the batteries work. (gentle music) (ladder clattering) - Sockets (laughing) Just do that again. This is where the music's gonna be. - [Narrator] But there's one thing Dick's not so happy about, Angel's glitter ball. - Oh, that is so terrible! (laughing) That is absolutely atrocious. I can feel a bit of a John Travolta minute coming on. - [Narrator] For the first time in its life, the old orangery has electric power. (jaunty music) There's just one week to go until the chateau's first all-important booking, 80 guests for a three day wedding celebration. But it's not just Dick and Angel who face one of the biggest tests of their lives. Arthur's three, and the summer's ending. He starts French preschool in a couple of days, a major life moment for him, and yet more for Dick and Angel to worry about. - Life's just a bit bonkers, at the moment. And, yeah, it's my number one priority to make sure that the house has a little bit of normality for the children. I'm sure they can't fit Arthur any more. It always comes at once, doesn't it? Busy times. Well, that's our life, though. But, yeah, Arthur's starting school. We have got, oh man, got so much happening. (sighs) (gentle groovy music) (pigs snorting) - [Narrator] A wedding feast is already planned. Roast pork is on the menu, and for that, you need a pig and a pig roaster. Commercial roasters cost 3,000 euros, but Dick has a plan, something in the barns that will do the job for nothing. - Since I spotted that, I knew it would be useful one day. Get out this bad boy. - [Narrator] It's a shapely French oil tank from the 1960s, in elegant steel. Angel's been instructed to visit the pigs. - [Angel] Hey, piggy-poos! - [Narrator] This is not, however, a social call. - Dick's given me a task, to measure the pigs. I think he's taking the mickey. (pigs oinking) (gentle groovy music) - [Dick] 150. (pigs oinking) -I'm 154. There we go. It's 154. Dick's like, "They're going to eat your shoes!" (laughing) Bye, piggy-poos! - [Narrator] 154 into 150ish might be tight, but there's a long way to go before Dick has to worry about that. (metal clattering) (beeps) - Never even crossed my mind that this could be full. - [Narrator] It's gooey old heating oil from who knows how long past, 400 liters of it. It's an unscheduled snag in the wedding plans. - We keep getting little setbacks. The chateau bites back. And instead of a day building a pig roaster, there's going to be a couple of days at the very least, because all the oil has to be pumped out, and at the rate this is going, I'll be looking like Popeye at the end. (laughing) (gentle music) - What's that, baby? Have your haircut. Having your hair cut, in you go. - [Narrator] Angel is taking time out from wedding preparations to make sure Arthur is smart for his first day at school. - Thank you. (Angel speaks in foreign language) (barber speaks in foreign language) - [Narrator] But has Angel enough French to explain what she needs? - So classic. - Classic. (Angel speaks in foreign language) (Barber speaks in foreign language) - Yes. (Barber speaks in foreign language) You know, we've been here over a year now, and don't have the brain for languages. I've really, really struggled. But I just have to, now. I'm not a confident person in English, my home language, so. I don't want violins about it, we chose to live in France. I just need to get on and do it a little bit more. I've not taught Arthur. I mean, he knows some basics now, but, he's like, "Bonjour, bonjour, lady!" (laughing) (gentle upbeat music) - Tickles. - Oh, my handsome man. (Dick groans) (metal clattering) - [Dick] Little bugger. Now. - [Narrator] Dick's roaster is turning into a saga. It's a stubborn beast, empty now, but still lined with oil. (tanker clanking) The remedy is to burn it off. - Right. This looks safe enough here. - [Narrator] It's best not to try this at home. - Bit of luck, that's just going to burn that away. I'd like you round this side, please, ‘cause it's. Can you can hear it. (tanker thudding) (Dick laughing) The chimneys make it look like it could be exactly what I hope for, a roaster. It better be after all this work. (gentle music) - Suzy. Oh, I'm so bad with my alphabet. - [Narrator] Angel is creating bespoke touches for the wedding guests. - You know, it's tradition in France, this part of France, that when the newlywed couple goes in to have their wedding breakfast everybody waves their napkins. But these are all French linens, all picked up from my favorite charity shop, and then they're gonna get to take them home. And they're gonna be keepsakes for people. "Cause it's got their name on, so they have to take it. (Dick sighs) - [Narrator] Dick's roaster seems to have been tamed, but it still looks like an oil tank. It needs a makeover. - I have a vision for my roaster, that can now be done. And this whole front face lifts up. I put a spit through the middle, and we have the pig at the top end of this roaster. (angle grinder whirring) (gentle music) This pig roaster is never going to get done. Right. (angle grinder whirring) (metal clattering) Give in. You're a pig roaster! (metal clanking) You (beeps)! (hammer clanking) In goes the pig, you light a fire, and. It seemed so simple when it was sitting out there in the building. - [Narrator] On the ground floor of the chateau, the much-needed downstairs loo has been taking shape. Its centerpiece, the magnificent wash fountain, a 1920s design that allowed factory workers to all wash once. (Angel laughing) - [Dick] That is ridiculous, isn't it? (water splashing) - Righty-tighty. Oh, it's brilliant. (tree creaking) Oh. (gentle music) - [Narrator] Angel's creative talent is key to the couple's renovation of the chateau. She's gathering some unusual items as material for her vision of making the downstairs loo as stylish as any room at Versailles. - I mean, you've got to have a bit of imagination. I guess, a bit of a creative eye. But at the end of the day, as long as you like it, then that's all that matters. That's quite sweet, isn't it? (drilling whirring) - [Dick] Oh, that's better. - [Narrator] Preparing the chateau for the imminent wedding celebrations may be the first big test of its commercial future. But, however busy a family may be nothing is as important as a little boy's first day at school. - Come on, Arthur Donald! You ready? (majestic music) Right, school! Arthur, if you need anything, you just ask for it, son. - Okay. - And remember, if you need to go to the loo, you go, "Pee-pee!" - Pee-pee! - He's got the French covered! (Angel chuckles) - [Narrator] The ecole maternelle takes preschool children from three to six, teaching reading, writing and arithmetic, all free, and all in French. - 23 children, two teachers, that's a total of 25, and only one speaks English. - (laughing) Who's that, Arthur? (Angel laughs) (gentle music) - [Narrator] With Arthur safely off to school, now's the chance to get on with those last outstanding jobs. There's just 24 hours to go. (drill whirring) Angel's decoupage doors have had a second coat of varnish. They've been drying, and are ready to hang. - [Dick] Well, that's a bit of a (beeps), isn't it? (gentle upbeat music) - It's amazing what you can find in your garden. - [Narrator] Greenery from the garden suits the vintage look Angel has designed, and it's free. - If you just pull a couple of bits of the laurel, so it's not drooping, you see, at the top? - Yeah, yeah. Is that all right? - Yeah, brilliant. And when the fresh flowers arrive tomorrow, I'm just gonna just insert a few in there, it's going to look beautiful. - [Narrator] Feeding 80 guests for three days takes a lot of provisions. Dick will plate up more than 640 servings before the wedding is out. - Roast pumpkin for some of the vegetarians, instead of spit roast pig. I know what I'd rather eat. - [Narrator] But bread and pastries will need to arrive in the morning, and in the middle of organizing the event, Angel has to go and order them in the nearest village. Since the bread riots of the French Revolution, every citizen must have access to bread seven days a week. So like most villages, Martigne has its own boulangerie. - [Angel] Okay, so. (Angel speaks in foreign language) (shopkeeper speaks in foreign language) (Angel speaks in foreign language) (shopkeeper speaks in foreign language) (Angel speaks in foreign language) (shopkeeper speaks in foreign language) (Angel speaks in foreign language) (shopkeeper speaks in foreign language) (Angel speaks in foreign language) (shopkeeper speaks in foreign language) (Angel speaks in foreign language) (shopkeeper speaks in foreign language) - Merci beaucoup! - Au revoir, merci! (shopkeeper speaks in foreign language) Somehow, I just managed to get her to understand me. I must be getting better, even though anyone that speaks French would be like, shouting at me. I know I say everything wrong, but you know what? I think I've got the order right. And a year ago, I just couldn't even do that, so it's just small steps, but you know, we're getting there, we're getting there. (gentle busy music) - [Narrator] The orangery is finally turning into a banqueting hall. Its batteries are charged and ready to go. But Dick's calculation for power hasn't included enough for a fridge. - Carry on with what you were doing. - [Narrator] Wine and beer for 80 guests will require a lot of ice. - You can organize s0 much stuff, but it can only come together at the last minute. You know, the cleaning, the flowers, even the alcohol, the ice, the food. Every element has five, 10 15, 20 things going on. Right, just for luck. - [Narrator] In the middle of it all, Arthur's been picked up from school by his grandparents. - Did you? - Yes! - Aw, baby, thank you! (yells) Did you enjoy today? - Yes! - Aw! And did you make some friends? - Yes! - And did you to them in English or French? - French! - French? What did you say? I said, "Bonjour!" (Angel laughing) (gentle upbeat music) - [Narrator] The chateau is finally beginning to feel more like a wedding venue. And the once derelict room has completed its transformation to stylish downstairs loo. It's looking as Angel always imagined. - Like it? I'm sorry. - It's geometry and nature in harmony. - I wish you meant that. -Itis! (gentle music) - [Narrator] Tomorrow's wedding won't be the first to be held at the chateau. (guests cheering) Dick and Angel's own nuptials took place here last year. - [Dick] We're married. - [Narrator] The bride and groom for this wedding will be arriving in just 12 hours. - It's the most important day of their life. And it's, you know, it's really special, it's gotta be perfect. So whoever's in charge of it needs to really, really care. I really, really don't want anything to go wrong. - [Narrator] Success is also vital to their long term plans for the chateau, but already, there's a problem. After a summer in the potager, the pigs have grown so much that Dick's days of hard work on the roaster may have been in vain. - Our girls are too big for the spit roast. We'll have a nose touching this end, and a bum touching that end, and nobody will be able to turn the handle. (upbeat music) (hammer clattering) - [Narrator] It seems the pigs may well have saved their own bacon. (gentle music) It's the night before the weekend of wedding celebrations, and Angel is still busy. 80 guests are due and she wants to double check everything is perfectly in place. I'm very sleep deprived but you just function on adrenaline. - [Narrator] Not wanting to run down the orangery's solar powered batteries, she works by torchlight. - I've got a bit of a long night ahead of us tonight. And, gosh. My brain is sort of malfunctioning a little bit. I need to stay focused. And I've not even had a pee today, or looked in the mirror. (majestic music) - [Narrator] The day of the wedding has dawned, and there are just a few hours until the guests arrive. The honeymoon suite is being given a final dust. And Dick has been sent up to do some last minute jobs. - [Dick] How are we doing, Denise? - [Denise] Okay! - Excellent. I've been given responsibility for hanging a hook up for the bride's dress in here. - [Narrator] Downstairs, Angel's busy giving detailed instructions on the exact look of the floral display. - You just need to make sure the top bit's tucked in and the bottom bit's tucked in. Tie, tie, tie, tie. Just pin it in. - [Narrator] Repairs in the honeymoon suite done, Dick can finally fire up his roaster. A smaller pig has been sourced at the last minute, and the hog roast is now definitely on. This better work, otherwise my name will be mud. (fire crackling) (gentle music) - [Narrator] Over the weekend, Dick will be wearing multiple hats, including that of the marriage celebrant. - I've not been a celebrant before, to be completely honest. I'm here just to make sure that all the things that Charlotte and Rich want are going to happen for them. - [Narrator] The guests are just minutes away. - Is that big enough? - No, bigger, bigger. They want to do a picture where they're all holding the balloons, so make them all high, yeah. I find it hard, to sometimes, communicate what I want, quickly, and in that time I could have done it. Get a little bit frustrated sometimes, under this sort of pressure. - [Narrator] But now there's no more time to fix any outstanding issues. - [Angel] Right, Freddie, Denise, I need everyone here really quickly, and Steve, please. - [Narrator] Angel, Dick, their team of 11, and the chateau itself, are about to be put to the test. - Teacups on the tray? - Yes, and outside, please. - [Narrator] In the competitive world of wedding venues, it's crucial everything goes to plan. If anything goes wrong, Dick and Angel's wedding business could be over before it's even begun. (upbeat accordion music) (guests cheering) (guest applauding) - Are they gorgeous or what? - [Guests] Yeah! - [Narrator] The happy couple have already tied the knot in England, but a whole weekend of celebrations is being held here at the chateau. - Today, Richard, Charlotte, they're making their public pledges. And it's all about love, it's all about commitment, and they're doing it in front of you, their family and friends. Rich, Charlotte, I can now pronounce you husband and wife. And Rich, you may kiss your wife. (guests cheering) (guests applauding) The happy couple, Mr. and Mrs. Twitchen. (guests cheering) (guests applauding) (gentle music) - [Narrator] The party can now begin in earnest. And in true Angel style, the champagne is served in vintage teacups. Of course. - Thank you, sir. - [Narrator] Now for Dick's pride and joy. - Oh, my God. - [Dick] That color, by way, is not burnt. It's oak smoked. - [Bride] What are you doing now? - I'm keeping the flames down and putting some more cider in here, so that it gets, the actual sort of steam will come over it. I love the look of it, the smoke machine. - The roaster? - The roaster! - The smoke machine? - [Bride] It looks really cool! - [Narrator] Nearly eight hours after the fire was lit, and the bicycle wheel spit first turned, Dick can see if his extraordinary culinary efforts have been worth it. - You see the layer, there? That's the smoke going into the meat! That's the money. - [Narrator] The spit roasted pig is Dick's homage to the French wedding tradition of sanglier, spit roasted wild boar, which is still served in the Loire valley. - Nobody even worries about the fact it took days of effort to make the roaster. The pig tastes good. - A soft drink. - [Narrator] As the weekend celebrations continue. - Welcome into the room Mr. and Mrs. Richard Twitchen. (guest cheering) - [Narrator] The pressure doesn't drop. (gentle music) (guests chattering) In the searing heat, one of Angel's nightmare scenarios rears its ugly head. There's not enough ice to cool the drinks. - The issue we've got at the minute is the temperature of the drink, which is. you know, I think wars have been fought on this. - Don't like to not have a colder wine. - [Narrator] But when the venue is over 175 meters from the freezer, what can you do? (gentle music) Dick has an ingenious solution. - We're allowed to have one hiccup. Couldn't go perfectly, could it? - [Narrator] No-one's noticed the icy drama, and the party continues with chilled champagne well into the night. After weeks of planning, preparation and precision work, Dick, Angel and the chateau have passed their first business test, even if utterly exhausted. - I think my bones may have actually gone from solid state to jelly-like. We have done miles. - I feel like we've slept maybe, like, six hours this whole week. (laughs) We haven't had any big crises. We've had lots of little things, and a little bit of stress. - Has most of the stress been your desire for complete perfection? - I always do this to myself, like, I just try and do too much. - And me. - And you. The bottom line is, they are so happy, and that's a good place to be, isn't it? - Yeah. (gentle music) - [Narrator] Next time. (child screaming) (Dick laughing) There's mayhem on the moat. - [Dick] The optimism of treasure hunters! (both laughing) - [Narrator] A new guest suite is given a vintage look. - I can't wait to have a bath in it. (chuckles) - [Narrator] And there's radical redesign from the top. - Are you going to drop your hair down? - [Narrator] To the bottom. - [Angel] The sewage pipe. Oh, it stinks! (laughing)
