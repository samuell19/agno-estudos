COLD LIGHT Address: Alfholar, 8. - It's 1973? - '73, yes. That's right. Is this admission material? Yes, these are some sketches I've done. Great. I'll take this. Grimur Hermundsson. I'm a beginner. - Admission material? - No. What do you have there? - It's a secret. - Please tell me what it is. - These are drawings. - Drawings? Did you do them? - Yes, when I was little. - Can I see? - No. - Please, let me see. Just one. - No, not now. - Would you do a drawing of me? - Just sometime? - Maybe. Sometime. Hi. Hi. My name is Linda. I'm the teacher of this class. I'm very sorry, I don't speak any lcelandic. I hope that's not going to be a problem. OK. Today's class is a model drawing. In this exercise I want you to draw just what you see. Is something wrong? Is she always naked? Would you rather draw fruit? - No, just... - Linda. Is nudity a problem for you? No. Do you know her name? - Linda? - No, the model. What difference does it make? I cannot draw people unless I know their name. Linda, can you help this guy out? He can't start drawing until he knows the model's name. Her name is Lara. Thank you. I'll see you all tomorrow. You stay. What are you doing? - I try to draw what I see. - Are you kidding me? No. What's your name again? - Grimur Hermundsson. - Grimur. You're not doing the exercise. You need to learn basic drawing technique. Don't waste your time. Thank you. FRESHERS' BALL I've never tried that. Bye. - Are you doing a picture of me? - Shouldn't you be asleep by now? I only wanted so see what you were doing. Grimur. It's morning. Gottina, eye candy. What? I saw Alfrun last night as I was sitting by the window. Did you see what she was doing? She flew past our window on a broomstick. Almost close enough to touch the end of my nose. She's a witch. Grimur nonsense-maker. I saw her very clearly, there was a full moon, you see. She was wearing a plaid dress. Her hair was white. And she sat across this broomstick. You are such a clever liar. I never lie, you know that. - Are you going to the bash? - What? The freshers' ball. I don't know, maybe. What are you talking about? Are you going? Excuse me? Are you going to the bash tomorrow? Me? I guess I have to. - You don't have to. - No. Maybe she wants to go. Isn't that the point? To bash us all together. You fancy her, eh? What? No, no. Well, I can tell you she certainly has the hots for you. She's got it bad. Someone is watching you. Always is. - Someone's watching you, too. - Really? Do you mean someone who's invisible? I meant something else entirely. Yes, I know. She had long white hair and a plaid dress. And flew somewhere on a broom. He was so scared. He had to crawl into my bed. And he told me he never lies. - Why are you looking like that? - Looking like what? You're both grinning. - What nonsense. - These are our god-given faces. I have to go over to Alfrun's place. I am going to give her a picture. Grimur, dear, Alfrun does not fly through the air on a broom. I told you so. A good imagination is necessary, but it can be dangerous to confuse it with real life. It's just a drawing. I'm not confusing anything. - I don't know. - She is not dangerous. No, she is just a little different. - How so? - It's hard to explain. She lives in a different world. Maybe she is a witch. - No more than I am, dear Grimur. - What do you mean, other world? Sometimes she cannot tell what is real and what she imagines to be real in her solitude. Like what? Well, for instance, she imagines that she isn't actually alone. - That someone is with her? - People who don't exist. - Who talk to her, maybe? - People that appear only to her. It's all in her imagination. But how does one know what is real and what is imagined? Oh, Grimur. Stop this now and drink your coffee. - Look out, see what you did. - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. Is Dad coming ashore today? I think so, unless the weather improves. Can I go if I take Gottina with me? The mountain is in all your pictures. - Mountain Tindur. - Tindur. It's amazing that these were done by a child. I like them. They scare me, too. Like this one. We're going out for drinks later. Wanna come? Or are you going somewhere with Linda? I might join you. You've obviously been getting private tuition. I have not had any private tuition. Don't you have to ask the model's name? No, I don't. I miss Lara all the same. Where has she gone, now? Well, this is a surprise. Is this for me? I thought I'd keep it here, at least. If you don't mind. I love the idea. - How was it? - Fine. Gudbjorg got a little bit drunk. So I left earlier. You're silly. Grimur Hermundsson. I like you. I love you. What's the problem? I said I love you. Yes. I just wanted you to know. I'm pregnant. What? I'm pregnant. Are you sure? Eight weeks. You could say congratulations. Or that you think it's wonderful. No. I don't know, I just... It's a surprise, l... I thought you were going to tell me about the gallery. - That you got it. - I did. But that's not important. It doesn't matter at all. Hi, Anna. Well, you're in a rush. Your tummy is getting bigger and bigger. - Can you feel it? - Yes. We are going to see a witch. - Alfrun. - The laundry lady? Yes. Bye. Wait. - Can you feel the spirit? - Please. What do you want? Well.... Er... We came to give you something. Well. Don't stand there like a couple of moon calves. Our Father, who art in heaven... What kind of a speech is that? Why don't you sit down? Why do you rattle through the wind with your sister, to give me something? - What do you want? - Well.... Er... He's got a picture for you. A picture? Grimur draws everything he thinks is important. He is an artist, you see. Draws pictures... Listen, Alfrun. I wanted to ask you something. So you have many errands. I have to run shopping errands for mum. But Grimur is not in a hurry. Wait, dear, I'll open for you. This is me. Thank you. Grimur. You have good eyesight. What is troubling you? Well, you see. Just tell me the first thing on your mind. Are you different from other people? Different? Why are you always alone? I am not alone. I have my people. I talk with them and they talk to me. That's just how it is. - Well. - Well what? I was just thinking about how time passes. Time. I really must go. You did not come here, just to leave again. You brought a picture. You came to ask. Are you leaving without an answer? I am just a child. You will grow older. You do not have to fear things you are not familiar with. I am not afraid, anymore. You have a gift, Grimur, good eyesight. That's why you are here. Don't be frightened of that. Our mind is like a bird that can fly wherever it desires. Can you fly? You've seen me fly. How did it go? Just fine. There is a spirit in her house. Were you scared? No, just at first. She didn't scare me one bit. What did she say about the picture? That I had good eyesight. - That you had good eyesight? - Yes. That's done, then. Now you have visited Alfrun. I'm going back. - You are? - I forgot to ask her about something. Did she mention anything about a child? - Just the eye candy - Gotta. - You're a child yourself. - Thank you. - Congratulations. - Hey, Grimur. - Hello. - Great exhibition. - Have you seen it before? - Before? What do you mean? - It's too crowded to see it. Oh, I see what you mean. - Have you seen anyone from class? - No. Oh, yes, Borkur and Helgi are over there. - Linda has sold several paintings. - Really? - At least eight pictures, I think. - That's pretty good. Isn't it terrible what happened to Lara? So strange, I never would have known her name if you hadn't made a fuss about it in our first class. What about Lara? - Don't you know? - No, I do not. She's dead. She killed herself. I feel as if I shouldn't have told you. Why do you think she did it? I was told because she could not be with her little girl. - Terrible fate. - Yes. Where have you been? Congratulations. The exhibition is just wonderful. Thank you. - We went out for a walk. - For a walk? - Did you sell much? - Ten. That's wonderful. I must be going. Thank you for the evening. It was just wonderful. OK. Bye. Wait. Thank you for coming. Thank you, Linda. Why can't I tell people that I'm pregnant? You can. Do you think it's time? Time? For what? I mean... Don't we need to discuss it? Yes. I mean... I'm not sure if I'm ready to be a father. Nobody's ever ready. Why don't you go back and hide under the mountain? Just make sure it doesn't fall on you. - Windy up the slope too? - South-southwesterly, gale force seven. I heard everything got blown away at your place? Yes, then everything was blown right back again. And you just kept on drawing regardless, Mr Artist. Yes, Mr Windbag. You are just jealous because you cannot draw as well as him. Party pooper Tumi. I'm not a party pooper. Anna. - I hope the baby will be like you. - Why? Because you are so much fun. Here they come. It looks like they caught well. Did you see any dolphins? Not many. But we saw a few whales. A pilot whale followed us to get out of the path of the wind. I am glad you are home. So am l. I am forgetting Indridi. Alfrun. - Alfrun. - Well, you're in a hurry. I forgot to ask you something. - What would that be? - Is that bag full of washing? That's my work. But you weren't going to ask me about this washing. No, do you sometimes feel Like you know what is going to happen, before it happens? I can't deny it. Also, if it is something bad? What's bothering you, Grimur? You must not tell anybody. I am frightened for mum and dad. And Gottina and Anna and many other people. What about yourself? Nobody believes me. What are you afraid of? That fear lives in this place. - I'm off then. - Don't forget you lunch box, dear. - Are you going out to sea today? - I expect so. You think I don't know you're following me? I'm just messing around. Is this some kind of a new game, eh? No, an old one. Follow the leader. - Come on. - Go on. Faster. Come on, now. Hey, come on. Look at this, Grimur. No. Now fly, you stupid bird. Why do you always draw such horrible things? - Oh. - Grimur. Come in. I'm Thorbjorg, the new teacher. I'm in the right place, then. Any news from Linda? None. What's new? I haven't seen her in ages. I don't know. You don't know? Did you break up? Yes. - But aren't you having a baby? - Yes. God, what happened? What happened? Maybe you don't want to discuss it? No. OK. Strange. But is she staying here with the baby, not knowing any lcelandic... She can just learn lcelandic, I guess. How are you? Cheers. I'll tell you a story. Listen carefully. Once upon a time there was a young woman. Poor and destitute. But she had one treasure. A little child that grew inside her. She had a boyfriend too. When the child was born, they had nothing to give it. They could not even be together. They asked God to take back the baby. Did they kill the baby? No. I'm informed that you know Indridi Einarsson. Are you a foreigner? We do speak the same language, right? No, I'm just from another fijord, boy. - What do you want from Indridi? - You ask like a policeman. I mean him no harm. I want him to go and see the world. He doesn't have time for that. He's got his hands full here. You are amusing. I'm his uncle. I'm going to offer him a job. Will you take me to him, or should I get someone else to do it? - All right, then. - Yes. Indridi. This man asked me to show him where you were... Thank you, Grimur. I think you should stay at home while Indridi is away. It's only one trip. You shouldn't go alone in this weather. The boats will sail together and soon it will be over. We cannot afford to stop now and you know it. You are not concerned with Grimur's silly dreams, are you? - You will be very careful, won't you? - Yes. Thora. One of the boats was found drifting, half full of sea water. They don't know whose boat it was. - It's not him. - Thank God. No, no. Svava. I've got something for you. What is it? Come and have a look. - Take this home and have a look. - Are those pictures of me? - Do you think this looks like me? - This is how I see you. I'm going to show this to Mum and Dad. Can you not stand still? It's a boy, kids. A dark-haired, handsome boy. Don't you think he looks like you? He looks more like Indridi. - Shouldn't he be home soon? - Of course. Everyone returns. Everything goes in a circle. You bring good things. This is from Mum. Anna has moved back home with the baby and all. It's not very far to the next house. Far enough in a blizzard. - She's alone. - Alone, not alone... Don't you worry about Indridi. - How did you know my thoughts? - I'm an old soul. Stop looking over my shoulder. Is that me? This is my family. But Alfrun is not a family member. Yes, she is in my family. - Where are you? - I cannot draw myself. And you always forget Indridi. It's as if someone is watching us. Tumi. - There you go. - Thanks. I don't like the look of your situation. Have you spoken to Linda recently? I don't think she wants to talk with me. Really? Why not? She's fine. How far along is she? - She has two months left. - And what? I don't know. I mean, you'd like it to work out, wouldn't you? I expect so. Why don't you come back east with me? It would do you a world of good. - I can't. - What's the matter with you, man? Mum's resenting this. You haven't visited since dad died. - It's been nearly six years. - You know I can't, I'm not up to it. Alfrun. Well. Finally. What is that on you face? You have grown so ugly, my dear. How was l? Extremely human. Lovely hands you have. I love you so much, dear friend. You'll get you your old room. Remember that bird? You should be ashamed of yourself. I did it by accident. I thought you'd think it was cool. Me? Cool? I wanted us to be friends. Can you forgive me? Yes, I can do that. Can we be friends, then? I like being alone. Are you crying? Tumi, the bank is on line two. I'm in a meeting. I find it uncomfortable being here doing nothing. There is nothing to do here. Grimur, relax. I can't. Why are you so hard on yourself? - Can't you a relax in the country? - Not here. I can't be here. Not idle. OK. Do you think they need a touch of paint? Sure. Do you think they need it? What do you think? Yes, sure. Can I decide how? Yes, you're the artist. I don't look like I'm sleeping. No-one sleeps in such a ridiculous position. Of course you can sleep like that. No real artist would draw a picture of his sister like that. It's as if I'm lying in the middle of a cloud. But I feel you might sleep like that sometime. Promise to wake me if you ever see me sleeping in such a silly position. It sucks to live in this kind of country. Oh, come now, Gotta... One can't blame the land if the Earth revolves and the sun can't reach us. Stop being so clever, smarty-pants. Grimur. Go deliver this dress I altered. Before it starts to snow heavily. Here's the address. - Should I leave right away? - Yes, that would be best. Can I come? - I will be quicker on my own. - I want you here with me. You can come next time. I'm off. Grimur, are you OK? Bye for now, then. Won't you come inside? - No, I'll just wait here. - Mum needs another garment altered. Hello, Grimur. Come inside and warm up. Grimur, you have to tell you mother that she did a fine job, as always. Well, boys. Can I offer you some more cocoa? No, thanks. I have to get going. - Are you leaving empty-handed? - I must get home. - You won't make it. - Well, boys. Grimur. I can't send you home in this weather. Stay until it calms. - I must, I must. - There, there. Let's go and have some more cocoa. I'll call your mother and let her know. There, now. Do you want to draw? I can't draw if I'm not at home. Remember, dear Grimur, that there are no coincidences in life. No matter what happens, no-one abandons you forever. Everyone comes back to you. Yes, I contacted you because they are on their way, and it will be a while before they get there. Hello. There's something here. Gottina. No. Linda, I love you. Linda... I cannot imagine my life without you. You and the baby. I'm back east. I'll be home in a day, or maybe two. I just have to finish off a job that I took on here. Linda... Did you hear what I said? Come as soon as you can. Come to me, my little precious. Yes, you're gorgeous.
