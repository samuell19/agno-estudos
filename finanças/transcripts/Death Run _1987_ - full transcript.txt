DEATH RUN Come on mum, don't cry When the batteries fail... ...there is an automatic regeneration process You'll have one hour to evacuate before final shutdown You are the hope for the future In a different world, I would ask God to protect you both Or... ...tell you how pleased I was that you would make a life together Maybe even give me the pleasure of grandchildren But in this world now I can only wish you luck Hello? Say something, Paul Speak to me I'm scared I don't know what to say Are we alone? I don't know How long were we down there? About 25 years And we're alive Look, Paul It's from my mother "My name is Doctor Eileen Saunders I work at the National Scientific Research Centre I have been experimenting with new forms of suspended animation connected with our space programme If you are not familiar with the history of our planet... ...a nuclear war of devastating proportions... ...is now destroying our civilisation Using the facilities here, I have risked the lives of my son and his girlfriend... ...by suspending them for as long as wil prove possible For as man is so intent on destroying life... ...there is hope of a new generation in the future world I pray... ...that Paul and Jenny survive... ...and it is you who are now reading this letter If so, my love to you And I hope the world you find is a better place... ...than it is now." Who's this little prickney? He's clean Yeah, like a newborn baby How's he survived out here? Look what I've found Leave her alone, leave her alone Leave her alone Coca-cola Piss off, fucker Don't waste the fucking petrol Get in the car Now! No, it's my turn Right between the fucking eyes Look what we caught. You'd better prepare her Leave her alone Paul! No! She has the skin of a child A lost child for the Messiah - What's your name? - J-Jenny Welcome to hell, Jenny What's going to happen to me? Where's Paul? - Have they killed him? - He's alive It's alright, you can eat it. It's clean Jenny sends her love What are you going to do to her? What are - Messiah, Messiah, Messiah... What do you want from me now? What more do you demand from me? Or have you brought me a gift? I...er..we found this, Messiah She's clean I like her I like her very much Are you alright? I think so. Where is Jenny? Is she OK? Yes, she's with the Messiah - Who? - You don't know? - No, should I? - You've never heard of the Messiah? Well, yeah... Jesus Christ was the Messiah - That was in the old world. Where have you been? - Asleep Believe it or not, we were suspended in time until just a few days ago Oh, shit. You should never have woken up - I've got to go - No, please. What's going to happen to us? - You're for the Run... - What's that? - ...and if you can get away from here before then, do. I'll try to help you... - ...bring you weapons - A gun? There aren't any bullets - They were all used years ago - What is the Run? - Shh... - Do you like her, Sly? - She's alright - For a girl - Yeah Get out You're as rare as a virgin, my child. Do you know that? Drink it Where have you been to remain so intact? Wastelands breed mutations Did you come to the city alone? No Oh, you do speak. Now, answer me or I'll have your tongue removed. Who did you come with? A friend My boyfriend Boyfriend? How quaint And is your boyfriend clean also? I don't know what you mean Clean. You must know if he is... ...clean. He's not mutated by contamination Does not carry disease from those nasty telltale scars and scabs As you are clean, my child Don't be alarmed. This is a genetic disorder. I am also clean That wasn't too difficult, was it? Come. Come closer Now kiss me here - What are you going to do to me? - I won't hurt you Now kiss me here Now kiss my hand Go on, kiss it, you bitch Now we can stop playing games Who are you? Why are you in here? I've got to escape. I'm for the Run What is it? What does it mean? - Say again? - I was told I was for the Run You don't know, do you? I don't know anything. I really don't know anything They took Jenny and I don't know So you want to escape? OK, how? There's a girl who brings food. She said she'd help First lesson: don't trust anyone, right? I've spoken to Paul. He's safe Why are you kind to me? Noone else is What do you want? I want to help. I know where you come from. I understand He's not the Messiah He's the devil He said he's not like other men. Before the holocaust he was kept locked away from the rest of the world Hidden away somewhere Noone knew then he even existed But he survived, and like the scum he is, rose to the surface And now he's the leader of this sick society He united every rotten thing in this new world It's OK. He wants to help I know you. You were here before - Yeah - You survived the Run - Yeah - The only man who ever has But they will make sure I don't this time. We've got to get away. Today You said you would get weapons I'll come with food, hide the weapons then. Pretend to capture me. Cause some sort of disturbance OK - What about Jenny? - Don't worry. I know what I'm doing Second lesson: if the tart of your dreams offers to save your life, forget about the first lesson - Come on, I won't hurt you - Get off - It'll be fucking good for you How could you be good for me? Isn't it obvious? Get off me. Do you think I want to catch something off of you? I've only got a few fucking diseases. You don't know what you're missing Prepare the Run for tomorrow They must both die then And the girl? I'll have her again tonight She may also die Kill him! I can't. I've never killed anyone before Use this next time. Understand? Or you'll be bloody dead Come on. We haven't got long Get a car. I'll get Jenny from the harem The alarm is raised. We're on our own - Get it? - OK, OK Where are you going? To the harem Why rush, Barbara? It is Barbara, is it not? - Yes - Don't be nervous It's such a strain for me, you know. I rule Junk City... ...but when I walk among my subjects, they hide from me You're not afraid of me, are you? I am. You are the Messiah. We live in awe of you, Messiah You were seen talking to the prisoners Why would they interest you, Barbara? They don't. They wanted more food, that's all I didn't think you wold want them to starve. You would want them fit for the Run Find out how they are. Give them more food if they want it If you are lying, you will be food...for the mutants Go on, kill him Get in the back and keep your head down It's always worse the first time The mutants are loose! Well, that's it. From now on we walk - Is she alright? - I'm OK She's not. She'll die if she loses any more blood We'll all be dead if we don't get off this road. We'll have to carry her Come on. We'll find shelter You cretinous worm How could you allow four people to escape from my city? We'll find them I'll rip you apart if you don't - Who are you? - Who are you to ask? Do you follow the Messiah? No - Are you rebels? - You could say that She needs help. There's a rebel camp not far from here Come with me. They can help you How? This wound is not going to heal by itself Come on, then You go ahead I'll fetch water to bathe the wound She needs rest. We should leave her to sleep - Will she be alright? - Don't worry She'll be alright Thank you. Give us a few minutes, please - I'm sorry, Paul - Why? - You'll soon be better - Let me die And leave me here alone? I love you, Jenny Don't even think of dying. You'll be safe here. I'll go and tell the others You'll be better soon, but first you must get some sleep - Thanks - What for? Well, helping. Being around at the right time You're a tough lady. I like that I'm not so tough. Only when I have to be I'm Barbara, by the way How do you do? And you? What's your name? I don't have a name. Well... ...I can't remember what I was called, and I've never been around anyone long enough to be given a name You don't realise how famous you are - Famous? - When you survived the Run, you were called a hero. You beat the system - You escaped from the Messiah - I'm no hero Well, it's a name, isn't it? She's going to be alright. The wound wasn't infected. She just needs to rest now - What about this car? Where did you leave it? - A long way back. On the road On the road? We're in hiding here That will lead them straight to us We never thought. Sorry - I'll go back and move it - I'll come with you - It could be dangerous. You'll be safer here - See you later - Where did we leave off? - Here - Haven't you found them yet? - No Well, they won't get far, will they? Will they? - No! - Get out It's sugar-free Stay with me tonight, Sly I've been so bored Don't worry, she's still sleeping. Just leave her alone. She needs the rest - What weapons do you have - A few knives. That's all - And the Messiah knows about you? - Yes - So he'll be looking for you - Hmm - We should move on tomorrow - Will Jenny be strong enough? - She should be Don't worry Thanks Jenny? No, don't! They've killed her. They're cannibals! No, please! Like you , I was escaping from the Messiah. I've been in the harem But because I was pregnant, they thought I'd make a good decoy. I was their prisoner Please believe me Go on The Messiah has traps like this everywhere. This was as far as I got. I had to keep my baby Let's get out of here You'll never get away. There's no escape. The only way is to kill the Messiah - Really? - I'd help you if I could Take anything you want. There's clothes. Petrol for the car But don't hurt my baby I'm sorry I found some petrol I'm really sorry, Paul. I don't know what to say Come on. Let's go back to the car - OK? - OK What the fuck are you doing here? There's mutants everywhere Why didn't you stay with Jenny? She's dead What was that? Mutants! Run! Where now? Let's go back Then what? Who knows? Come on - Come on, what's the joke? - Nothing No, I was just saying it's funny to think you're going to be my mother-in-law - Well, they're usually old dragons, aren't they? - Look at my son Oh, you don't mean that No I love him, really And I love him too Paul, come on. We've got to leave No, she was right The only way is to kill the Messiah How can the three of us do that, Paul? - You know the Run, right? - Yeah Tell me about it First, you have to know how to fight, how to cheat Play them at their own game They'll taunt you and try to break you down But surprise will be on our side When you are prepared for this, allow yourself to be captured and leave the rest to us We found the little fucker And the others? Don't know about them Where are they? Dead! They're all dead, you bastard What an amusing fool you are I've been so bored recently There's been an absence of excitement Tomorrow we shall enjoy the Run Keep angry, little boy It might increase my pleasure I'm not afraid! Not anymore. Look at you. You're all cowards You hate him, but you're too afraid to do anything This was when it was possible to love someone Just be happy You make me happy If our plan works, and we survive tomorrow... ...maybe soon, things will change for everyone How about Paul? - Are you sure this will work? - No You don't think they'd kill him before the Run? No way. Don't worry I'm not. If we die, at least we tried to do something You're the best thing that's ever happened to me Be glad it's me. This could be our last night together First lesson Never think about tomorrow I feel guilty I'm sorry. Please understand. That's what I want Not the life I've had I love you Welcome to the Run! Goodbye, little turd... He's doing rather well Get in there! Go on You know what to do. Good luck Run, you bastard Listen to me Do you want to spend the rest of your lives here, slowly being killed off by that maniac? Trapped in here, waiting to die? Terrified of being attacked outside by the disease-ridden morons that surround you? I have weapons for you Arm yourselves now, follow me, and there's hope of freedom and a new life outside of this place It's me! Don't kill me! For fuck's sake, somebody help me Find him Bother Fuck Sly! No! It's him. He's alive Over here Right between the fucking eyes What are you doing? Help me! Kill those traitors. I am your Messiah. I saved you from oblivion This is to free the world This is for the nights I had to spend with you - And me - And me I still live This is for Jenny We must leave here. Now the killing will stop We can start a new life. We'll grow crops, build houses Use the knowledge of the old world for good The evil is dead! - Would you like to join us? - Yes And my son All are welcome.
