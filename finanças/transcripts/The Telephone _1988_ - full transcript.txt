That's the shitiest tape I have ever seen. It's putrid. You look like a splotch. Like a Xerox splotch. (laughter) What the hell are you laughing at? She's funny, can't you see the audience loves her? You think that is funny? That is tasteless! Blue, I think you are terrific. Rodney, when am I gonna be on a tape? -I want to make a tape. -Are you kidding me? I would never allow a client of mine to appear in a piece of dreck like that. You might as well be in a porno skin flick. Rodney babe, it's all in the eye of the beholder. That's right! -I think she is funny. -Oh yeah? Wait outside, cunt! What? Rodney: I just want to talk with lady privately, okay! Rodney: Outside. -Well, thanks, Blue. -Miss Boxe, my pleasure. I think you are terrific. You actually consider that crap to be humorous? Rodney, does-- Hey, hey, that's my last Marlboro. You mind not taking my last cigarette, please. I'll buy you a carton. Thank you. That's so Caucasian of you. Look it doesn't say humorous person on my mailbox. It says V Blue. Period. How do you know it's not going to get better, funnier, brighter with time? -Please, I don't think so. -Vashti: Oh, give me a break! Now, you remember I broke my bottom trying to get you commercial work. Remember? You broke nothing trying to get me-- And you didn't get any work because of your attitude. Attitude, girl. The correct attitude. You know, you are right. The more I think about it the righter you are. And you know, I've been working on something kinda special. And I think... I think you'll like it, Rodney. I think you should sit down, Rodney, 'cause... this is something I feel like is just for you. You know I based it on Salome's Dance of the Seven Veils. Honey: Rodney! Would you wait in the fucking car! But I call it the "Dance of the Seven Flatulencies". (humming) The first flatulence is dedicated to the dickhead producers. (making fart sounds) (humming) And the second to asshole agents. (making fart sounds) You get my drift, Rodney? (making fart sounds) What's the matter, you seem a little nervous. I mean these flatulencies were made just for you. -(making fart sounds) -Christ Almighty! You know you should see a psychiatrist. A shrink, you should see a shrink! Rodney: Go to a hospital for the insane! -Yeah! -(owl hooting) So now prosperity begins to mellow and drop into the rotten mouth of death. Here in these confines slyly have I lurked to watch the waning of mine enemies. Owl, thou did prophesize the time would come that I should wishfully to help thee curse that bottled spider, that foul hunched-back toad. Earth gapes hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray, to have him suddenly conveyed from hence. Cancel his bond of life, dear god I pray, that I may live and say, "Rodney... is dead." I am going to get you evicted from this building. Thank you, no, no, please. Thank you so much. -(banging on door) -Thank you. No, no, we must have music to soothe our savage beast, shan't we? Yes.

Hush up in there, I am trying to check my stuff, lady. I really can't understand what you're saying but I'll try it again. Oh, god, I hate these machines. Oh, god, I hate these machines. Hi, Jen, it's me. I want you to listen to something. No, really, I want you to just listen to something, okay. Hold on. (answering machine beep) I really can't understand what you're saying but I'll try it again. Oh, god, I hate these machines. Who does that sound like? Can you-- Well, no, you hear the way he said machine? Just the idea of him saying machine. You know who it is. He hated machines. Are you trying to tell me that you don't think it's possible that it was him calling and disguising his voice? Here, wait a minute. Oh, I get it. Oh, I see, you don't have time to like check this out with me. No, excuse me, Miss I-am-too-busy-for-my-friends. No, it's not problem for me. It's not a big deal for me, Jennifer. I mean, Jesus Christ, you know, I... I don't think that it's so hard for you to do this for me. Now, just listen one more time, okay? ...what are you saying but I'll try it again. Oh, god, I hate these machines. Hi. Didn't it sound like him? Well, yes, of course, I slowed it down. That's how you make an ID on a phone, you slow it down. That's what they did in the Kennedy case. It's a voice print. Okay, fine. No problem. Yeah, just... Jennifer, I just want you to listen to this, okay. Because I think that you can really help me identify the person on the phone. I think it's Larry, okay! What do you mean what's the matter with you! There's nothing wrong with me. No, I am not tense. I am not tensed at all. I just wanted your help. That's all. I just want you to help me ID this thing. That's all. Oh, well, yes, excuse me. I see you have to get your rest. Well, Jennifer, let me tell you something, you know. I haven't slept for a couple of days now, you know that. No, I haven't. I haven't, no! I've been sitting around trying to figure out what's going on on this machine, see? But I don't have any friends anymore. Anyone to check it with, you see. So, no, yes, of course. I've tried Percodan, I've tried Demerol. I've tried Nembutal. Yes, I've taken them all. As a matter of fact I took so many of them the other night I got up and I got over to the middle of the floor and collapsed. Yes, because I couldn't get out of the chair. You know what I am saying. I got up and I couldn't like get it together to walk, Jennifer. I mean, I have been taking so many pills to just try to keep myself in some kind of order that I am a little... I'm a little... I'm a little over-sensitzed. You understand what I am saying? Well, it just so happens that all I can seem to do is think about Larry, you know. So that's why I am calling you. That's why I am calling you because you are my friend, you know. And I... I... I can't quite take it any more, you know! I've... tried everything. God, I have sat there, I have tried to immerse myself in some kind of mind fluid that will black his face up for me. But unfortunately I can't seem to do it. Do you know what I am saying, Jennifer? I just can't seem to quite get it together, to get this guy out of my mind. You understand? It was quite a run, don't you think? Well, I... I just... God, I'm real embarrassed now. God! Yeah, I'll breathe. Yeah, it's okay, I'm breathing, Jennifer. It's okay. You know, guy is showing me all sorts of memory there. Who knows this... This could be the beginning of some award winning performance, Jennifer. And just think... You were there, you were the midwife. Ain't it great? Christ! The time you start freaking, you know. I should just sit down and remember that piece that Sam used to do, remember? Yeah, I did it for you when we first met. Yeah. Yeah, from Blues for Mr. Charlie. It was a classic. He lay beside me on that bed like a rock. As heavy as if it were like he had fallen, fallen so far and landed so heavy. He seemed to be sinking out of sight, with one knee pointing to heaven. My god, he covered me like that... He wasn't at all like I thought he was. He fell on... He fell on me like life and death. My god, his chest, his belly, the rise and the fall and the moans. How he clung, how he struggled, life and death. Why did it seem to me like tears. Yeah. Yeah, it's a gorgeous piece. Oh shit, Diana Sands, man! She killed with it. She was something. She probably had Larry in her life too. Yeah. Boy... I didn't realize it was so late. Um, right, you know... Do what you... go do... you know. I'll just, I'll call you later. No, I'm just gonna stay and I'll... I'm expecting a couple of calls. Yeah. Thanks, though. Yeah, I'll talk to you later. Yeah, have fun. Bye.

And baby, I've got everything you need. The Saint's bar and grill? Great, can I speak to Big Ray, please? Yeah, Big Ray, you know Big Ray. Actually he is not as big as he thinks he is. I guess that would be a matter of opinion. He's pretty, pretty hard to miss. You know who I am taking about? Oh, yeah, can I talk to him? Well, why didn't you say that? How long has he been gone? Ten minutes. Alright. No there's no message. Thanks. Did you think that you were going to be able to refer to my mother that way and not piss me off? You know, boy... If I didn't know better, I think you were looking for a Chicken Licken. But I'll have to give it to you in a minute, boy. I've got business to attend to. Now about that problem. Well, it seems I have left the phone off the hook. Gives the old phone company the ability to just take my pants in payment. Do I care? Fuck no! (banging on door) -(dog barking) -Hey, lobster-crack peeler! -Neighbor: What do you want? -What's going on in there? Neighbor: Be quiet! I am watching Wheel of Fortune. I am feeling a little lonesome out here. I don't have any one to talk to. - Be quiet! -And I thought maybe since you are such a sweet woman I might be able to muster up a little cracker spoon for you. You see there's something about a person who lives alone in a small room and gets a little distorted, you know what I mean? I don't think its anything that anyone should be concerned about. But there's something about you, babe, that makes me want to be a mighty man. A man that has more to offer than just a little horse's pecker. -(banging on door) -But some affection and some respect for what you know you know how to do. (neighbor screaming outside the door) Because often times people don't like to listen to what they think you know because they are sure that you don't know what you're talking about. Well, I don't agree with you. I think it's very disgusting that you would put her in such a situation as this. (neighbor screaming outside the door) This has got to be a job, always more to love. Listen to that Afro-mambo-beat, baby. -Get down! -(clanging of utensils) Yay-yay-yay-yay Well, I must tell you that I think it's very awkward of you to keep going on this way when I am pleading with you, when I am begging you for some kind of human contact. (clanging of utensils) Because nobody's home tonight, every one is out. They are all out in the streets partying. I don't think it's really that they're partying because it's more like people are begging, screaming for someone to make them say, "I am coming." (clanging utensils) (dog barking) Neighbor: After my Wheel of Fortune I'll bring the super and throw you out. Vashti: Throw me out? Did you fuck up my lights in here? Was that you? Neighbor: Get away from my door! Why do you think you can just come into people's life, do the fucking thing and turn the lights off? -It's not what I wanted. - Get away from the door! All I wanted was someone to talk to. (banging on door) (dog barking) It seems that my lights are out now and I can only assume it's because you've blowing your fucking hair with your goddamn blow-dryer over there. But that's okay. Because I'm not really that nerve wrecked about it. It's really not something I'm freaked out about at this point because you know, it doesn't bother my owl. Because he does his best work in the dark. Doesn't bother my fish, because he don't give a shit! I mean, so why should I be freaked out about the fact that I don't have any light. But that's not really true, is it? I don't think it's really true. You're crazy! I don't think it's really true at all because... I've had worse situations than this. I have overcome shit that no one would ever believe. So why should I let a little darkness freak me out? When there are these sturdy wooden matches that god gave us, so that we would never have to freeze in the fucking jungle again. I wonder if that's why... Catholic churches use it. I know I have more candles than this. There we go. Good old Larry, saved my ass one more time. (owl hooting) ♪ (instrumental music) God... Why have you forsaken me?

I have to finish up my work, can you open up? I think you should come back another time. You see it's after 8 o'clock.

Now, I've got myself a city action permit here on behalf of the telephone company, and I'm afraid you gotta open the door. Sir, your services are not needed here tonight. - Oh, come on, lady... -(banging on door) you're wasting time for both of us. Huh? Hey, come on, lady... will you open the door? (banging on door) (banging on door) Easy, peasy. You gotta lock your door, you know. It's a terrible neighborhood.

Oh, and this is illegal wiring thing. I saw that too on the way in, that's cute. You could... you could get reported for that. You sign that thing or what? I beg your pardon? Well, I got an order to pick up an instrument. This is the instrument, right? This is the one, the only one? You are not hoarding telephones or anything like that... I mean, I really don't want to have to come back here. Is that the receiver? Could you get that for me? I really don't care to go in there, if you don't mind. Must be crazy. See, I'm an actor, that's my profession. When people want to call me for jobs they call me on the phone. And you... you take my mother or my father, my kid if I had one. But I cannot let you take my phone. Are you kidding me, lady? You mean to tell me that you like actually, actually developed some kind of a sentimental attachment for this telephone? It looks more to me like something you'd have phone sex with. It's... it's not sentimental attachment It's my lifeline. It's the way I'm connected to the world. See, without it I... I don't exist.
