You Tube - Video Running Time 02:38:57 You Tube search name - Barsaat(1949)(HD) Hindi Full Movie - Raj Kapoor, Nargis - Bollywood Classic Movie-With Eng Subtitles THE MONSOONS You're enjoying the music and I'm struggling with this. Some musician! There's a slope. Push the car, quickly. Quick! Rush! The slope is nearing. "In the breeze flies my red muslin veil" "See how it flies in the breeze, my red muslin veil" "My heart beats to the rhythm of the wind" "My heart beats to the rhythm of the wind" "As the wind blew, it lifted the veil to reveal my face" "In the breeze flies my red muslin veil" "See how it flies in the breeze, my red muslin veil" "In the stream, the cold water cascades" "In the stream, the cold water cascades" "I walk gracefully to the beat of my anklets" "In the breeze flies my red muslin veil" "See how it flies in the breeze, my red muslin veil" What are you doing? Must you throw away a young girl's veil! Give it to her yourself. With all these beauties, suppose it belongs to an ugly girl. You should be able to judge. Some people can judge a book by its cover. I'll return it and come back. Bye! Bye! - Is this your veil? - Yes. - Your fields? - Yes. What is your name? I'm asking you what is your name? Why? Because I've a reason for asking. You're like lightning. Hey, listen! Listen! Hey, listen! Listen! - Hey, come fast. - Yes, I am coming. Listen! - Coming! - Listen! Coming! Must you call your whole family? I want to talk to you. I'll go, if you want me to Come on, hurry. - What happened? - Something will, hurry up! What did happen? Stop your acting, the butcher's chasing us. Quick, let's go. Your car is giving trouble, too. ! Start it immediately. Hurry! He's coming. Hey, stop! What's in the letter? I asked you, what meaning did the veil convey to you? Nothing. Thank God! At least you spoke. What had happened there? Nothing. Didn't the girl agree? She must be good. Even the good have a mischievous smile for me. Do you know what is sinful and what is not? A sin in one country may not be considered one in another. Is there a universal scale to measure good and bad? Is there one? - Yes! - What's that? The greatest scale is... you wouldn't hurt anyone's feelings That is the difference between the good and bad. You talk like an ancient poet, that's why you're a failure. O great poet, this is the 20th century. People do not have time to be emotional and sentimental. To be progressive you've got to cheat. Look at it from a materialistic point of view. You've seen it from one angle, never emotionally. Don't say such things here. Maybe it's not your fault, true love comes from true feeling. You're a flirt. Why are you lost in thought? Love is all right for poetry. In today's world clich√© phrases are of no use. They are used in pornographic books. When you feel desire, satisfy it. Marriage isn't worth it. He has liberated views on this. Whoever I meet, I consider as my own. Do in Rome as the Romans do. That's all right. Oh that's the spirit. C'mon hurry up. We must reach the summit before evening. If you have to push this old pet tonight, no more talk of love. I don't believe that love is either real or useless. It doesn't matter. Tell me, do all the girls I meet love me? Who knows maybe some of them really do, and those who don't... do it out of the need to survive. Please stop lecturing. We're coming to Satpura village. Stop at the Dak Bungalow. There's plenty of time, we'll reach the city. It's wonderful! I have to meet someone here. Why say someone? Say a girl. Okay. Girl! Who is she? You remember last year, we spent a night here. And we met that beautiful girl. She is an orphan and carefree like us, but she's cunning. She can easily fool you. Take care, she may steal your heart. I will wait here until you return. - So you'll wait? - Yes "My heart feels restless. Spring is here again." "Come home O beloved, I await your return with impatience." "My heart feels restless. Spring is here again." "Come home O beloved, I await your return with impatience." "The sun and moon are witness to my longing for you" "The sun and moon are witness to my longing for you" "Tears fall from my eyes Like rain from high above." "Tears fall from my eyes Like rain from high above." "My heart feels restless. Spring is here again." "Come home O beloved, I await your return with impatience." "My heart feels restless." "A star has fallen and has vanished into the earth" "A star has fallen and has vanished into the earth" "A flood of tears has set my heart afire" "My heart feels restless. Spring is here again." "Come home O beloved, I await your return with impatience." "My heart feels restless." "My eyes search for you, If only you'd come back to me" "My eyes search for you, If only you'd come back to me" "I wait on the path filled with hope, come home, O beloved" "My heart feels restless. Spring is here again." "Come home O beloved, I await your return with impatience." "My heart feels restless. Spring is here again." "Come home O beloved, I await your return with impatience." You've taken so long? You should be happy I came at all. They wouldn't let me go. Who is she? Do you mean some other girl? The landlord told me to visit another hill station this year. But I had promised. So I came without letting my family know. You're lying, It's my sighing which brought you here. These are not sighs but sobs. I'll take my shoes off. Someone said... Even if a man gives his life for a woman, she won't believe... it's for her. Don't cry. This isn't the way to wash my feet. I've plenty of tears for that. Perhaps your tears are mingled with a look... that may cast an evil eye. I'm no magician. You haven't changed. Are you convinced that... it's for your sake I haven't changed? I'll fetch water. - Why have you closed your eyes? - Has she gone? - Who? - The other girl who was here. My dear, you destroy my world, and then ask why I do not die? You made me promise I wouldn't see another girl. Since then, whenever a girl appears, I shut my eyes. So the image of your face is always before me. See how it is. I hope I am not dreaming. I still can't believe you are really here with me. And you love only me. I promise you... that if you see me even talking to another girl... you can kill me. Stop this morbid talk. If someday I see you with another girl... Remember, I'll do something drastic. Why must you say that? There's a terrible storm - What? Where's the other gentleman? He's gone out. Isn't he afraid of this terrible storm? It's unlikely. He must be playing with a greater storm. Is there a great storm coming? Yes, it is. It's raging now. Where! In two hearts. You won't leave me and go away? Will you take me with you? When I return, I'll take you with me. When will you? In a couple of months. - By then, the rains will start. - What rains? There's only one rainy season. All I know is my eyes fill with tears like rain when you're gone. You've started your poetry again? I'm feeling sleepy I have to leave early tomorrow. I won't let you leave so early. Why? My friend in the Dak Bungalow will be waiting. Call him here. When did he turn pious? He is a saint. If he's a saint, then please call him here. Don't you like my devotion? How can you be a devotee? Can God be a devotee? What is it? Tomorrow there's a festival being celebrated at the next village. And I had decided... I would dress finely and dance for joy. That's why I am stopping you. How could I dance if God Himself wasn't before me? If that's all it is, then tomorrow you'll dance. "In the rainy season.." "In the rainy season, we met one another" "In the rainy season, we met one another" "My eyes reveal my youth. My eyes reveal my youth" "They tell the story of the heart. They tell of my heart" "Why do I feel bashful of the one who is mine? "Why do I feel bashful of the one who is mine? "In the rainy season" "In the rainy season, we met one another" "Love has adorned me, I became a bride" "Filled with magical dreams, my spirit began to dance" "Today I've become yours. And you are my only lover" "In the rainy season" "In the rainy season, we met one another" "Time passes speedily, how do I stop it?" "Time passes speedily, how do I stop it?" "In anticipation of you, I stand. My eyes search for you" "If you don't return for the sake of our love" "In the rainy season, we met one another" "Don't stay away lest I despair, lest my breath leaves me" "Don't stay away lest I despair, lest my breath leaves me" "If you don't return my desires will turn to ashes" "From the burning flames within I call out to you" "Alas, we could not meet. We could not meet again." Why haven't you changed? Don't you want to find a house? If we hurry up now, we can go to the club later. What's wrong? Why are you staring like a fool? Can you still see her eyes? Is her memory haunting you? Yes. I'm thinking of her. You've been smitten. Look at me. You inexperienced fellow. I move like a wave on the sea, I do not thinking of the above. Here, it's a new bank. Your philosophy shouldn't suffer defeat because of her. Is she beautiful than the other. You've no idea. It's not beauty. When I saw her, I thought she's the girl you love. If her love is true, it can change the direction of the waves. You will give her... tears of blood. What are you thinking, O great poet? Even if God sends a woman from heaven. She won't soften you. Do you mean tears of blood? Today, you can laugh about it. Remember, the price of love isn't cheap. One day you'll know its value. Then, even if you cry your life away. You can't repay. Repay? You probably do not know that I repay love by cash. Yesterday I paid rupees 10. This note. Look carefully. Are you surprised? Here's the note you gave her last year. She gave you? To buy her a nice sari. So she'll go to your family and they won't call her uncouth. That's it. The girl's shrewd, she's asked for clothes worth Rs. 200/- These women are not as innocent as they appear. Hope your good mood helps you to hurry. The estate agent is waiting downstairs. He is shouting since long. Come on! Let's go! This is a very beautiful and airy house, sir. Half the house stands under water. Sir, you go up. They are very rich people. Both of them will stay here. Sir, don't forget my wage. Yes, sir. This is the house. This is a very good house. Sir, look how beautiful the painting is. Madam can sit here and enjoy tea and biscuits. Sir, look at this side. No, no, sir! Look at this side. You leave him! How nice people they are! - You listen to me, sir. - You need reward, don't want? - You need reward, don't want? - Yes, sir! Yes, sir! - Then, let's go inside. - Let's go sir. - But this has been closed. - Oh sir, I have forgotten it. The watchman lives in a hut outside. - I will call him. - Okay! Hey, Ganju! Hey, Ganju! Hey, Ganju! Hey, Ganju! - Hey, Ganju! - Hey, Ganju! - What a strange name! - Ganju. He is bald headed, sir. He has no hair on his head. That's why we call him Ganju. - Sir, I will get reward, won't I? - Yes, you will get it. Okay, sir! He is bald, that is why he is called Ganju. - Who will show us the house? - I will. It's a girl's voice. Always girl's voices. I'm sure it's a girl's voice. I never make a mistake. Oh, nothing is there. What do you want? What do you want? What do you want? We'll take this house. How much is the rent? It's vacant, but my father isn't at home. If your father isn't there, can't you show us around? I'll show you the house, but he'll settle the rent. Don't worry, if we like it, we'll pay what he asks. We'll pay any price. Okay. Yes son, this is nice place to stay. Yes, sir. Come on, hurry up! Help him. Take the boat. What are you waiting for? Hurry up! Who has fallen into the water? She has been taken out. Did Reshma fall in? Where is she? She will be all right, it's only shock. Here's some medicine, give it to her every two hours. Gopal, go with the doctor. I'll give here the medicine. Then get my luggage. Come on, sir. Sir, will my Reshma be all right? The doctor has said there is nothing to worry. She'll be well tomorrow. If her father was here, I would have taken her home. I'm blind and helpless. May God bless you. Don't worry. Mother! Don't worry. Your mother is just here. It's you? In this house? We like the house. Don't talk. Just go back to sleep. Okay. - Won't you sleep? - Don't talk, sleep. I feel restless. I've fallen in love. My heart is restless... You're not asleep? I don't feel sleepy. Why don't you go to sleep? That's what I was thinking. Don't know what has happened? It's happened. - What's happened? - I'm in love with you. I feel restless. Embrace me once, I cannot live without you. Did you see? Understand? Sleep quietly. What about you? Why don't you both sleep and stop arguing like children? Off to the river? Now? Let's go now, Reshma is bringing the boat. I have understood everything. I'll forgive you. Why? I thought, as my student, you are following in my foot-steps. I gave you the girl as a reward, she is well-brought up. Take care not to spoil your teacher's name. I haven't understood anything. You will understand everything slowly, you're just a beginner. Today you are taking us to see a spectacle. Teacher, why don't you come, too? Don't shed crocodile tears, I'll wait for you, go. Everything will be all right. Don't get mixed up with girls because they're cunning. - You haven't sung that song? - Which song? - "Fallen in love". - In love? If you really love songs, then you sing. When I start singing, I sing for so long you'll get tired. You sing only one song, I know so many. - But I don't remember any. - Why not? Because I compose songs myself. How can you compose songs? You're lying. How can you do it yourself? Liar! Why aren't you ready, aren't you coming? I'll stay here today. You're no friend. Do you know Ruby and Bimla are coming, too? Those cabaret dancers will be there. It's going to be grand. Come on! Meet her and give her my regards. Stay here and sing her a song. Find an inspiration for your poetry. I'll see the dance. - Okay! Bye! Bye! - Bye! "Look, it's raining for so long." "I've fallen in love with someone" "I've fallen in love with someone" "I've fallen in love and I feel the restlessness" "I've fallen in love with someone" "I've fallen in love with someone" "I had hoped to conceal the sorrow" "But the secret has been revealed" "I had hoped to conceal the sorrow" "But the secret has been revealed" "Look at what my heart has done. O beloved, my heart beats fast" "I've fallen in love with someone" "I've fallen in love with someone" "My eyes have revealed what I hoped to conceal" "What I wanted to tell you remains hidden in my heart" "I've fallen in love with someone" "I've fallen in love with someone" "In our glance, unspoken words were expressed" "My heart tells you, I am all yours" "In our glance, unspoken words were expressed" "My heart tells you, I am all yours" "O what have you done, beloved? My heart beats faster" "I've fallen in love with someone" "I've fallen in love with someone" "I've fallen in love and I feel the restlessness" "I've fallen in love with someone" To go on like a parrot, do you know what you are singing? You think I don't? But I understand - Everything? - Yes. Look into my eyes and tell me what you see. Yes. Tell me! I see myself Look! You can see me in them. See for yourself. Can't you see me? Something else? What? The river Please, come. The water here is deep blue. Because the river is deep. Just like your eyes. Lake! Deepness! Very good! Even you've started composing poetry, you're really in love. But what is love? What is love? - What is love? - Yes Don't you know? - You said you know everything. - I don't understand this. That is why I am asking you to explain. Love isn't something one explains, it's something one obtains. - Love can only be felt. - How? Love will make itself felt like a thorn prick. - When will it? - It's unpredictable. It appears suddenly like a flower out of season. Then you know what happens? What? Everything feels new. In someone's eyes, you'll see a river. You'll feel like drowning in it. The moon is like a bridal mark. The sky's tears and dew-drops. Moonlight falls on the dust of the feet. "Someone is on my mind." "Someone is on my mind. Someone is here to stay" "I cannot sleep at night. What shall I do?" "Someone is on my mind. Someone is here to stay" "Someone is on my mind. Someone is here to stay" "Someone is on my mind." "When the stars smile at night" "When the stars smile at night" "Sleep vanishes from my eyes" "Sleep vanishes from my eyes" "I sigh ever so quietly, O what shall I do?" "I sigh ever so quietly, O what shall I do?" What overcomes you? When you laugh you end up crying I was singing your song. On this happy occasion, you're sad. There's no life without laughter and tears. These joys and sorrows for the design of love. Your kind of love has tears from the very start. Without tears, real love doesn't exist. Look! Smiling flowers, crying dew-drops. The combination of beauty and love is beautiful. That happens when you love. That is why love is measured not in terms of time... But in terms of longing. "Your sparkling eyes. Your slender waist" "You're in the prime of life. What do you lack, tell me?" "Your sparkling eyes. Your slender waist" "Your sparkling eyes. Your slender waist" "Come to me, sweet love, I shall abide in your heart" "I shall abide in your heart" "In the intoxicating 'breeze" "In the intoxicating breeze I swirl and kiss the buds" "Like a wounded deer, when we're apart, I seek you everywhere" "My life is like a wondrous journey" "My life is like a wondrous journey" "Your sparkling eyes. Your slender waist" "Your sparkling eyes. Your slender waist" "Come to me, sweet love, I shall abide in your heart" "I shall abide in your heart" "I can't stop my eyes from crying despite a hundred pleas" "I can't stop my eyes from crying despite a hundred pleas" "I'm the flowing river" "I'm the flowing river that flirts with the shore" "I flow on to new cities and to new places" "Your sparkling eyes. Your slender waist" "Come to me, sweet love, I shall abide in your heart" "I shall abide in your heart" "Your sparkling eyes. Your slender waist" "Your sparkling eyes. Your slender waist" At night, you sit like a music teacher with your instruments. What's wrong? What has happened to you? You're asking such a difficult question. Not even the poet Ghalib could answer. That is why he said: O innocent heart, what has befallen you... Is there no remedy. I am tired of hearing about your heart-ache. Why are poets so pained? Forever grieving. It's a secret. How would you know? O lord, you have created strange creatures called poets... Who suffer some torment. If you want to live in this world, be happy. Life is the name of laughter that dazzles like a firecracker. That's the difference between us. You only see the sparkle. You don't see, that to light the sparkler you require fire. At every step, you can find a new woman. You forget the girl who longs for you. Whatever you say, it seems as if you're on her side. I like your poetic expression of sympathy. Bravo! Today, you're taking it lightly, Gopal. If her love is sincere... and when those other women desert you. You'll be at her feet. - Who has Lily gone with? - Her friend. - Where is Ruby? - You mean that dancer? Gone with a friend. "And when those other women desert you" "You'll be at her feet" - Hello, Ruby! Hello! You have come. - Oh, hello! Hello! I'm sorry, I have no time I'm going out. Bye! Bye! Bye! 'When those other women desert you.' 'You'll be at her feet.' I am feeling terribly upset. Something tells me, he isn't well and he's thinking of me. He must be making fun of you, not thinking of you. Either way he thinks of me. Why wouldn't he mock you? You're crazy. How can you trust strangers? He must be having fun. And you long for him. No, I'm sure something is wrong. When I sleep, I have nightmares. I see him lying ill and calling out to me. At such time, he needs someone to look after him. I don't need anyone, I have never sought help. Not even in Love. So I don't get hurt. And I can die laughing. A man can die laughing. But weeps at another's death. A man who can laugh at his own death... can do it for others. In this world you suffer death before you die. In those painful moments you need someone. Then you realise the value of true love. I'm surprised you don't know this. I have learnt something. That a girl's love is worthless. Since this is your first love, you talk so philosophically. I can tell from experience the strength of love. A father's blow can quell the flame. If the family hears, it means scandal. There are several obstacles that hinder love. You, too, will find out. Let the entire family get in the way. Call her in, she must be cursing me. Why is the bread like this? May be the flame was too high. Throw away the burnt portions. Is this burnt? I forgot, mother. This isn't the first time. Something is troubling you. Why don't you tell me what it is? Nothing. He's forever playing. I can't hear. He plays the sitar so well, nothing appeals to you. It sounds awful. What's worrying you? I told you it's nothing. Please eat. I know everything. Your father will come tomorrow. And he will arrange your marriage soon. Mother! What do you gain by making someone suffer? Who's suffering, you or me? Ask your sitar. It does not give me a second's peace. What is it? I don't know what, but it says something. Really? What does it say? I can't tell you, but it definitely says something. I don't know the language. I feel as if there's someone inside me who understands. Which song is this? It's an English song, I once heard at a club. Do you like it? What do you like? - Your sitar? - It isn't a sitar, it's a violin. - Sitar! - Violin! Sitar! Do you know, tomorrow my father is returning? - That means you won't come here. - Why? - Because... - You don't trust anybody. In love you trust each other. Or else, a wall of doubt is created. I don't understand what you are saying. O God, she hasn't understood me and she will never understand me. I do, but you don't see what I have to say. - My mother was saying... - What? She said when my father comes tomorrow... My marriage will be settled. - Your marriage? - Yes. That's good If I'm here, I'll watch the bridal procession. I'll play this sitar at your wedding. At our wedding, a shehnai is played, not a sitar. If you play the shehnai this is of no use. Why don't you understand? What? That my father... Your... - Reshma! - Yes! Reshma! "Those who live in the realm of love" "Those who laugh and mock themselves" "Love can make you laugh" "Love can make you cry" "Love can unite you" "Love can separate you" Who is singing? Someone who is heart-broken Whose heart is broken? You warn others when they are in love. But you have been cheated in love. Do you understand? "O smiling flowers, don't forget this." "O smiling flowers, don't forget this." O God, it's so cold today. You are tired. Your bed is ready. Go early to bed. Let me finish smoking. Reshma cares so much for me. After all, she's your daughter. What will happen to us if she gets married? Have you settled her marriage? I've much to tell you. First let me finish smoking. We have received a good proposal. Don't worry, father, it's me. What is it? - I want to drink some water. - Okay. It's so cold. Who is there? What is the matter, Reshma? Nothing, father. You said it's cold, I want to cover you. It's really too cold, dear. Okay! Now go to sleep. Stop playing, I'm here. You are in my arms like a violin. I feel like stirring your heart so you will tremble. The strings of my heart vibrate already. You can't hear the sound. Fake relief is useless. If you've moved, would I injure my fingers on these strings? What have you done? You don't trust me. Like Heer Sayal. Heer Sayal? Heer Sayal She was the woman in a pair of legendary lovers of Punjab. How can I be compared to her? Heer deceived the King who gave up his throne to marry her. Who was the other couple? Sohni Mahiwal. Was she good? She was true to her lover. She would cross the river with the help of a clay pot... every midnight to meet Mahiwal. Inspite of knowing the pot was unbaked... and would easily dissolve in water. She waded into river. So their love wouldn't be tainted. So what if there was a Sohni... Most girls prove to be like Heer. Gopal may be right. It takes time to find out who is true. If a man is true he has to go through many ordeals. Those who wait for an opportune time, will lose. Time does not wait for anyone. Time moves at its own pace. It doesn't stand still ever, no matter how fine the moment. However beautiful riches and wealth are... there's nothing in this world more beautiful than honour. Every poor person should keep it in mind. This is the only treasure... by which he can hold his head high. But, father! Why did you say this? You're to marry someone from the next village. Before a daughter gets married, it is every father's duty... to tell her, in the form of advice, of life's experience. That is real dowry. I've seen much of this world. I've served many guests in this house. They've trapped girls with false promises and ruined them. It's the same story each year, and I've seen the girls dying. I've never seen even an outsider return. "Heer deceived the King who gave up his throne to marry her" No! 'Heer deceived the King who gave up his throne to marry her.' 'It takes time to find out who is true.' 'Those who wait for an opportune time, will lose.' 'I hate these people.' 'If it's not the question of my livelihood. I wouldn't even see the face of anyone of them.' 'I will be like Sohni. I will be like Sohni.' 'If it's not the question of my livelihood.. I wouldn't even see the face of anyone of them.' 'I will be like Sohni. I will be like Sohni.' 'Today, you, too, have become Heer Sayal.' 'Most girls prove to be like Heer.' 'Today, you, too, have become Heer Sayal.' No! 'Today, you, too, have become Heer Sayal.' 'I will be like Sohni.' 'Inspite of knowing the pot was unbaked...' '...and would easily dissolve in water.' 'She waded into the river so their love wouldn't be tainted.' I will be like Sohni. Reshma, come back! I'm caught in the current, I cannot come back. Come back, Reshma! You will ruin our name, our honour. I'll kill you. Father! Father! Father! You can't compel us to leave. We've paid for the whole season Cash. Even if you return the money, you can't break the contract. You can't ask us to go whenever you like. It's no use quarrelling, Gopal, we'll leave this place and go. We'll move right away. Whatever he's done or is doing is right. He doesn't mean it. In our country many act like that, for sham respect. They don't know true love. You should have asked me once, what kind of love mine was. You've met those who've made false promises and hated them. At least one must have proved true. The flower you nurtured with your hands, didn't... your soul cry out when they threw it in the water. Ask this water, if she wasn't pure like the Ganges. Doctor! - Doctor! - What? Doctor! What brought you here so early? I want you to come with me, quickly. - But what's the matter? - At least, stand up. Come on, quick! Come with me! Oh, let me walk. I will go myself. - Is she still alive? - Yes. Get eight or ten flowers from Panchavati and come back soon. Remember to get them from a big tree. I have finished applying it. Take good care of her. When the paste dries, apply some more. Okay. I will come in the evening. Help me wash my hands. Yes. How can you leave her in this state? I've to perform a marriage, It's an auspicious time. Nagina's marriage? Doctor. What is it? My marriage? Will it never happen? Who will marry you and get their bones powdered? Let me get engaged now, if I can't get married. Wait a little longer. God will send someone for you, through the roof. What does it matter, even if she arrives in water? He'll send someone. - When will she recover? - In fifteen or twenty days. We need God's help. He sent me a bride in the flowing river. It is said that when God gives, he gives abundantly. But today you have been overwhelmed. Isn't she beautiful? It is a question of luck. I remember a story where he brought a fairy of Kohkaf. Pour the water. Take this water, Doctor Can you hear? It's raining. The doctor said, you'll have new life in you. You'll be perfectly well. Look! I've brought you some fresh fruit. I have picked them myself. Take these flowers, too. Sir! You called me sir, my name is Bholu. Sir! Call me Bholu, not sir. Look outside, there are new leaves. Let's watch the rain. Look! The monsoons are here and the new leaves, too. But he hasn't come. Don't tell me about him. Do any travellers keep their promises? He promised me, he would be here with the rain. You stupid girl, whoever comes in the rains never stays. The rivers that are so turbulent in this season... are still later. You cannot depend on promises made in the rainy season. Look there, he's come. Was that your friend?

I warn you. Getting married is an expensive business. Yes, of course! For a marriage I charge three rupees, eleven and a half annas. Yes, of course! You have to buy whatever is needed for the ceremony What's all that? The bride needs many things. You'll have to purchase them. Tell me what I should get. You've been married five times. You should know. I'll tell you, but you'll have to go to the city. Then Doctor, why don't you tell me quickly? She's looks very forlorn. Whom do you mean? The bride? Doctor! My feet! Oh, my feet! Oh, leave my feet! Doctor! Doctor! Sir! Sir! Sir, I am.. Sir.. You've returned? - Where is Babuji? - Which Babuji? My Babuji who has sent you to fetch me. I implore you, please take me back to my Babuji. Or else, the devil who wants to marry me will kill me. Take me to my Babuji. I forgot that Babuji had sent me to collect you. Your Babuji sent me. Come in, sit at the back. - You're going to Babuji. - Yes. - Let's go quickly. - Of course. - Where are you taking her? - She wants to join Babuji. I had told her that Babuji was coming in the next car. Leave him. He has come to take me to Babuji. Who is Babuji? I'll thrash you until I break your bones. I want to go to sir. I'm warning you, if you go out, I'll beat you to pulp. Call your sir! I will pound him too. Understand! "Who will stand by me?" "Who will stand by me?" "Who will stand by me?" "Who will stand by me?" "O beloved do not forget me. Who will stand by me?" "Who will stand by me?" "Who will stand by me?" "Who will stand by me?" "We're separated. I'm far, far away from you" "I'm hindered from meeting you" "We're separated. I'm far, far away from you" "I'm hindered from meeting you" "My weeping heart beckons you..." "Who will stand by me?"

"If I had wings I would fly to you" "But how shall I come to you?" "The force of destiny has rendered me helpless" "Who will stand by me?" "Who will stand by me?" "Who will stand by me?" "Who will stand by me?" Reshma, where are you? You told me you didn't understand anything Then how did you learn to sacrifice your life? Where did you learn to do that? If you had to go, why didn't you take me? Why didn't you take me? Why didn't you take me? I'll take you. Come on! Won't you listen to me? Come on! Why must I go there? I don't like the roads. Can't you do that much for a friend? Come with me. In that case, I won't go. Don't forgive me, Gopal. - Listen to me. - I don't want to hear. If you feel for me, then give me my things. Come! - Where else will I go? - I'll take you to the city. I beg you, take me at least once to the city. My Babuji will reward you. What can he give me? It's God who has... granted me with a bride like you. You're embarrassed! The auspicious time for our marriage is in four days. I'll buy you clothes and bangles. Anything you like. Come on, darling! Get up, darling! Come on, darling! Come on, darling! I will take you to the market. Darling! I will take you to the market. Darling, get ready immediately. Hello, Pran! I've brought him with difficulty. Now, let him set well. I fear he will leave again. Hey, boy! Come here! - What colour would you like? - Ask her. Show my queen bangles for her marriage - Shall I show her these ones? - Yes, this is alright. Make her wear this. Doctor had suggested him not to dance. So, can I have the pleasure to dance with you, madam? I am so sorry. I am tired. Lily! Oh, that's perfectly alright. It's perfectly alright. Look, both of you talk a little. Meanwhile, I will dance a little. Excuse me! Won't you dance today? No, I won't. Even if you don't want to dance, come to club this evening. Hey, wear it carefully. Will you wear these? Ladies and Gentlemen! They will now play a popular various melodies. "Which song are you playing?" "It's an English song I once heard at club. Do you like it?" "I like the way you play" - 'Not Sitar! - Violin!' - 'Sitar! - Violin!' I am very sad.. Darling, look at this. Darling, look at this. Darling! Do you like it, darling? Babuji! Babuji! - Where's my Babuji? - Which Babuji? That was his song. This is his sitar. You're playing my Babuji's sitar. If you know, tell me where he is. You must know, how else could you play this song? You must know. Or else, where did you learn this tune? I beg you, please tell me where my Babuji is. - Who is this girl? - I don't know. Hand her over to the police. I'll take her away. Don't say anything to her. She's mad. You also get out! Wretched woman, you've tainted my honour. You know whose bride you'll be? - Let me go to sir! - Shut up! - You've tainted my honour. - Let me go to sir! "My beloved has left me. My beloved has abandoned me." "My beloved has left me. My beloved has abandoned me." "My love has broken a heart filling with love" "My beloved has left me. My beloved has abandoned me." "We're no longer together. We're now apart" "My love has broken a heart filling with love" "The buds smile as they blossom into flowers" "The buds smile as they blossom into flowers" "When I see the clouds gather, my eyes fill with tears" "We're no longer together. We're now apart" "My love has broken a heart filling with love" "Who knows the whims of love, Only I do, my heart does" "Who knows the whims of love, Only I do, my heart does" "When my eyes close; I see memories dance" "My beloved has left me. My beloved has abandoned me." "My love has broken a heart filling with love" "The heart was first set ablaze, then came the rain" "The heart was first set ablaze, then came the rain" "Such is the fury of seperation. I am forever restless" "We're no longer together. We're now apart" "My beloved has left me. My beloved has abandoned me." It seems as if you'll lose your mind. I wonder why it's taken so long. It should have happened long ago. Are you insane or am I? What is it... that torments me? Is this love? What's then, Gopal! I don't understand anything. I can no longer think. If love is only physical, how can it be so strong after death? Your belief is so strong, that I wonder... if you may be right, and that questions my convictions. I get fed up with life and become restless like you. Why must that be? It isn't new. People have split emotions. Which are in opposition to one another. There are times when I look at you and... You are my other side. That's right. That's what I've thought, too. Does it mean that as we are two sides of one person... and if we were to love the same girl... would that create true love? You amuse me, I accept your argument. - Let's go. - Where We'll love the same girl. You make me laugh. That's nothing. Today, you'll come with me for a walk. - Where to? - Wherever I like. Get up! Get up! - But Gopal! - Come on! Listen, Gopal! I am coming. - Where are you taking me? - Shall I tell you? I want to prove, you can buy the love you consider priceless. Silver coins can buy anything. You do not understand the meaning of love. You seem to. That's why you're going crazy. - No! - Why? No, Gopal! For God's sake, let's go. Where are we going? Unless we find a place where I see the truth I wanted... to show you, we won't go back. You're still not ready for the wedding. Hurry! Perform the marriage quickly. Why are you delaying? It's just over. A tribal's marriage. Let's see the ceremony. "If I'm here, I'll watch the bridal procession" "I'll play this sitar at your marriage" 'No.' "At our weddings a shehnai is played not a sitar" - 'Shehnai? - Yes.' "For your wedding, a shehnai will play" Let's go away. I don't like marriage music. I don't like marriage music. A "shehnai" would have been played at her wedding. Let's go away. Let's go away. - Where shall we go? - Far from the music of a "shehnai" - To see a girl? - To any hell... Where we won't hear it. Now you're talking. "O traveller, return to me but once" "Once, we've exchanged glances, don't turn your gaze away" "O traveller" "You made promises, you swore by me" "You made promises, you swore by me" "I live by your promises, I wait in hope for you" "I live by your promises, I wait in hope for you" "I implore you, never forget me" "Once, we've exchanged glances, don't turn your gaze away" "O traveller" "The world has taken you from me. The world surrounds me" "The world has taken you from me. The world surrounds me" "On my lips I utter only your name" "On my lips I utter only your name" "Don't make me weep, that the world mocks me" "Once, we've exchanged glances, don't turn your gaze away" "O traveller" "Don't belong to another now as you belong to me" "Don't belong to another now as you belong to me" "Now as you abide in my heart, don't desert me" "Now as you abide in my heart, don't desert me" "Stand by your word and the promises you've made" "Once, we've exchanged glances, don't turn your gaze away" "O traveller" "O traveller, return to me but once" "Once, we've exchanged glances, don't turn your gaze away" "O traveller" You see Pran buys and sells love. I've left the cigarettes in the car. I'll fetch them. Why're you standing outside? Do come in. Don't call me Babuji. My name is Pran. How can I take your name? What else? Lovingly, she called me Babuji, too. Who was she? Do you sell love? Do you sell love? Why? For money? Why waste time talking about things that aren't important? Come in. Let's talk of pleasant things. You need money for the child? Who is its father? He came here once, two years ago. I haven't seen him since. The child is very ill. There isn't a single dispensary around these parts. I don't have money for the doctor. He is an important man's son I fear that... if he comes, he'll accuse me of neglecting his child. He'll accuse me of neglecting his child. Let's go We'll go. First tell me how the bargaining of love went. She's a mother - What? Not a woman's love, but a mother's love is being sold. What do you mean by this? You won't understand. You're modern thinking. Come on, doctor! Hurry up! You're going back? Even after she's dead, you return with hope. It's folly. One cannot live by obstinacy. Life compels you to move on. I don't like you acting like a T.B. Patient. If you want to die, commit suicide. Call it love or friendship, you're my weakness. I can't leave you. If you want to die, better commit suicide. They're playing again. Stop it! They're playing again. They're playing again. A vehicle has met with an accident. What's wrong? The car has fallen into a ravine, hurry! Yes, I am coming. Why are you looking at me? Hurry. I'll fetch a doctor from the city. Take care of him. I'll reward you. - Hey, doctor! What has happened? - Come here. Come here. So much blood! He's badly injured. He's pale. Feel his pulse. Is he alive? He's still living, but Bholu... Take the girl home. Leave her. Remember those Panchavati roots... Lift him slowly. Remove his shoes. Lift him slowly. Doctor, please send the ambulance immediately. I fear a delay of even one minute will be dangerous. - Let's go! - Please, come! Where are you, O traveller? Come this way once, so that I may see you before I die. Babuji! Babuji! What has happened? What have you done to yourself? Open your eyes! Talk to me, look at me, I'm Reshma. If you were upset by my wedding... why did you pass that way? Babuji! You said you'd play the sitar at my wedding. You said you'd play the sitar at my wedding. Tell me, sir! Look at me. I'll sing your song. "Someone is on my mind, Someone is here to stay" "I can't sleep at night what shall I do?" "Someone is on my mind, Someone is here to stay" This is my Babuji. I don't know what's happened, he's badly hurt. He had come to take me with him. I'm glad I know of him before we married. Perform the rites quickly. I'll throw the body in river. I'll throw his body in river. - No! - I'll throw him in river. - Don't take him. - I'll throw his body in river. Don't take him. Get lost! - Please, leave him. - Get lost! - Please, leave him. - Get lost! - Please, leave him. - Get lost! Leave my Babuji alone. - Get lost! - Please, leave him. Call the police. - Leave my sir! - Get lost! - Leave my sir! - I'll throw him in the river. Leave him! Leave my Babuji! If you don't listen, I'll chop him in two. No! Bholu! Babuji! I won't spare him. Bholu, police have arrived. Now I'm like Sohni. Pran! Pran! Pran! You can go back home. Why? Aren't you pleased now? Why say ominous things? What good omen is there? The doctors have given up hope. They operate for the heck of it. He's as good as dead. For the doctors, he dies then itself. He does not fear death. Only love can fight death. My love's so strong, it snatched him from death. A thousand deaths together will not affect him. Cannot not affect him. Don't get upset. Babuji cannot die. No, he can never die. Babuji cannot die. Babuji cannot die. Your talk will drive me mad. Go away. Pran will die. And I shall cause your death, too. You won't need to kill me. My love will destroy me. He said, love can bring one back to life, or take a life away. Like me, trust in God. He always saves love's honour. I don't believe in God. If Pran lives... I'll believe in love's power. And I'll worship you. The operation is successful. Pran will live. Doctor! Look! - What's all this? - It's magic. - Magic? - Yes, magic. I'll teach you magic. What use is it to me? I get my work done without magic. Why don't you try and understand, sister-in-law? The doctor said Pran's bandages will be removed shortly. By then, I want to make you into a lady, a fine lady. - A lady? - Yes, a lady. A lady? Yes, a lady. I want to make you into a lady... so that when Pran sees you... watch what'll happen. What? He'll be thrilled. He'll be so happy that he may give you to me as a reward. Don't say that. We haven't much time. Let's begin with the first lesson. This is called a sari. This is how you wear it. Something like this. And this is powder. Lime! It isn't lime, it's powder. When you put powder it makes your face white. I don't see how they use it. Sister-in-law, you look lovely. It's wonderful, you've learnt so quickly. You must learn how to speak. If you learn a little English, you'll be a real magician. Back to the same subject. I refuse to learn. You'll never get a teacher like me. When you're with him, don't forget to think of me sometimes. That won't happen He said we'd stay together. It's impossible. - Why? - I don't know how to tell you. What did you do? I do? You've transformed me. He couldn't do it alone. Like a Goddess, you've charmed him with love. I thought love was madness, now I want to become a disciple. Really? Tell me who she is same girl. In these mountains, there is a girl just like you. Sit down. I'll tell you her story. Her name is Neela. On the way here there is a settlement. During the monsoons last year when Pran and I... I've always made false promises. The poor girl pines for me. You've done wrong. You don't know girls of the mountains. You make false promises and go. These poor girls spend their lives together. If they can't bear it, they voice their pain in song. So their songs are tormented. That's why they are moving. It melted a stone-hearted person like me. Don't speak a word of this to Pran because I want to give... him a surprise. Let's go to the hospital to visit him. Reshma! Good morning, sir! Good morning, sir! Gopal! What happened to your hair? Look at her. The Satpura village is here. You've got time. Shall we go? Something has happened, I've to meet someone. Why someone? Say a girl. A girl lives there and each year he fools around. I'm tired of explaining to him. Sister-in-law, did you forget what I taught you? - Not yes! Say, 'yes, sir'! - Yes, sir! - Greetings, sir! - The rest of the luggage is in the car. If some day I see you with another girl. Remember, I'll do something drastic. Have some tea. Gopal, have some. Gopal! - What's happened to him? - I don't know. Ask him. Pran, I'm going. Come early tomorrow so we can leave. I may not return. You're hiding something. What is it? Nothing. She knows all about it. What's the matter? Gopal is going to meet Neela. He will stay with her. Is it true, Gopal? Gopal! Is it true? Why don't you bring her with you? - Because... - What do you mean? You've forgotten. You have told me, in love you should only give... Never ask. If she leaves everything behind, it will be a big sacrifice. What have I given her? That's why I made this decision. If I've understood the meaning of love, I should give all up. To be equal to her. I must attain that height. What are you saying? I've only deceived her. To make up for it, I'm going to her. I'll leave you both for now. I'll return soon with her. Pran, I can't live without you. Go ahead, Gopal. I won't stop you from the path of truth. Let's embrace. Don't make the parting difficult. I've never cried before. Today is different. You've shown me the way. Won't you show us your bride? First let me make myself worthy to call her my own. For that I must do penance. I don't know how long I will have to do it. Nobody knows it. Next year when you're passing through be our guests. We'll serve you delicacies. Gopal! Neela! Neela, I'm here. It's Gopal. Neela! You've come Neela asked if you should break someone's heart like this. Who are you? A friend. Why is there so much darkness? If light exists, it must be bright. If there's no light of love in a heart, it's always dark. I didn't follow. You won't. You're a city man. Is this the way you repay her? You brought that woman along, to tell her you're married. Didn't you ever think you had a commitment towards her? Did it strike you that for love one can swallow poison? The one who pined for you for such a long time. Has left us and gone forever. If you had shed a single tear for her. The fire in her soul wouldn't light her pyre. You're cruel. You promised to return in the monsoons. You're like a flaming pyre. Neela, I'm here. You waited so long, couldn't you wait a couple of hours more? You believed my false promises. Why didn't you wait for me? Before dying... you didn't let me be rid of my shame. "In the rainy season, we met one another." "In the rainy season." "Don't stay away, lest I despair lest my breath leaves me." "Don't stay away, lest I despair lest my breath leaves me." "If you don't return, my desire will turn to ashes." "From the flames within I call, alas we could not meet." "Alas we could not meet." "Alas we could not meet." "Alas we could not meet." "Alas we could not meet." "Alas we could not meet." "In the rainy season."
