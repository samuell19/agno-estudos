How many "Y"s do I put in "Hey" at this time of night? -Is it before 2:00 a.m.? -Yeah. -Two "Y"s. -Okay. -Three is thirsty. -Thirsty. And one is curt. You know what I was thinking about? Cookie dough became so popular. It's 'cause it's not finished. It could still be anything. Hundred percent. Making cookies out of cookie dough is just a suggestion. -Hundred percent. -That's what they say -you could do with it. -Right. And the same thing-- like dating someone for more than a month. It's just a serving suggestion. Hundred percent. "Kara question mark." That means I don't remember -where I met her. -Okay. But it's a question mark with an exclamation point, which means I should want to follow up. -Let's see what the options are first though. -Yes. Exactly that. That's the world that we're living in. You can just see what the options are for anything. Like with travel. You're not gonna just pick the first flight you see. You want to see all the flights. -That's a good thing. -Yeah. You get the best flight that way. Why wouldn't you get the best person by looking at all the potential people? And how could you even expect to find one person who could fulfill all of your needs? It's easier just to find the most supportive person here. -The funniest person here. -Right. -The best sex here. -Right. The best advice here. The second-best sex here. Hundred percent. I don't ever want to go past knowing what someone's parents do for a living. If I know what someone's parents do for a living... -Right. Right. -I've hung too long. Or, like, siblings. Like, why does anyone want to know about your siblings? Especially so early. -Yeah. -"How many siblings do you have?" Has that ever changed whether you want to date somebody? It's like, "I have two sisters and a brother." -Whoa. Hold on. -Well, I'm out of here. -I'm out of here. -You know what I just say? I only date only children or the oldest of three. They say, "Exercise your options." It's like a muscle. -Options are like a muscle. -Yeah. Some people are weak and atrophied, and they don't understand -how to exercise their options. -Yeah. My options are burly and strong and turgid. Hundred percent. People say guys like us are afraid of commitment. No. We're afraid of commitment to something we can't get out of. There's no such thing as fear of commitment. Fear of commitment is fear of regret. Hundred percent. Or fear of intimacy. Please, I'm intimate with everybody. Do you ever wonder, if you did find something deeper with somebody, if that would somehow be more meaningful? I do sometimes. Like right now, I'm casually dating, like, six or seven different women. But I do wonder, deep down, what it would be like to seriously date two or three. Even when I don't understand you, I understand you better than I understand anybody. -Hundred percent. -I love when we hang out. This is like, if someone were recording this, that's what my podcast should be. There should be, like, the sound of a stand-up bass playing under me right now. Okay, I got one. "Brunette Random House Party." "Random House," the publisher? Or "random house," like a random house party? Oh, "Emily Vogue." Uh, I'm gonna go with "Kara question mark" 'cause I feel like letting the universe surprise me tonight. -What a time to be alive. -Hundred percent. -Hundred percent. -Hundred percent. Hundred percent. -Hundred percent. -Hundred percent. I figured it out. Figured what out? America. Okay. I know you're laughing, but I have a pitch you're really gonna like. America is divided, but it's not for the reason that we think. We think that America's divided by geography: red state, blue state, city, country. We're missing something far more profound. America isn't divided by space. America is divided by time. -We don't live in the moment anymore. -Mm. And why would we, when we can live in any moment that's ever been recorded? And when we experience something we really love, our overwhelming instinct is to somehow file it away for later. That's interesting. We don't watch movies in the theater. We don't watch TV when it airs. We don't even have conversations at the same time because we text. And when you text, I can say, "Hi," and you could say "Hi" back in a second, -or a minute. -Or never. Or never 'cause it's you and you're too busy producing the biggest podcast in America, which is kind of my point because we're all living in our own individualized times. That's why we're living in divided times. That's... I like that. Ooh. -You like that? -Yeah. So, what do you think? Do you think that's a story? It's a theory. -A theory is a story. -No, a theory is not a story. Yes, it is when it's about an idea. And America is an idea. That's what makes it so great. -So, if you're... -No, America is its people. That's what makes it so fucked up. Hey. Not every white guy in New York needs to have a podcast. You have the verified check mark. You got the New Yorker position. I want something more. I don't just want to be a writer. I... I want to be a voice. As dorky as it sounds, I care about America. And not in that faded Lana Del Rey way. And now I see it falling apart, and we're just standing in the corner, like, making fun of it, you know? I'd like to try to tell some story that... connects. Okay, okay. Well, then... let me help you connect. With all your ideas about America-- even if they're good, right?-- you gotta put 'em in a story 'cause Americans listen to stories. 'Cause Americans are people. They're not... ideas. -You're-you're here. -Yeah. You need to be here. Does that make sense? Hundred percent. I'm Robin Dillon, and this is American Moment. To the organizers of the Western Montana fly-fishing... -Hi. -Hey. You changed your hair. -Yeah, you noticed. -Of course. How's the book world? The what? Uh, nothing. Uh, can I get you a drink? -Yes. -Great. Um, what can I make you? Um, can you do, like, a white wine? Um, sure. I have to open a bottle for that. Oh, that's okay. Open it. I only want, like, one glass. -Hello? -Ben? Yeah. Hello? This is the worst phone call you're ever gonna get in your life. Oh, my God. Your girlfriend's dead. I'm sorry. Wh... What did you say? She's dead. No, no, the first part. Your girlfriend. Yeah, I'm sorry. Hey, I don't... I don't understand. I know. I know, I know. We can't make no sense of it either. Who is this? This is Ty Shaw. Abby's brother. Um, hey, I don't... I don't really know what to say. Oh, I know, I know this must be so hard to process. I'm so sorry. Abby told us so much about you. Abby. Oh, my God. Abby. Who's Abby? Uh, some girl. Um... -Who's that? -Uh, some... We definitely hung out a few times. I-I wouldn't have... Funeral's Sunday. Oh, my God. I'm, uh... Can you tell me where I can send flowers? Oh, there's no need to send flowers, Ben. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I'm absolutely gonna send flowers. Just, uh, you tell me the address. See if you can text it to me. If you really want, there's a flower shop by the airport. We'll just swing by there when I pick you up. When you pick me up? Uh, hey. I will be there in spirit. Spirit Airlines. Right, man. That's a great choice. You just let me know what flight. Uh, hey, uh, I... This is just... I can't do this. None of us can do this. Not alone. Y'all had your whole future ahead of you. Okay. Okay, don't cry. I mean, no, cry. Cry. -Um, of course. -Oh, God. Be in touch with your emotions. Um... I can't believe we have to go through this. Okay. All right. Um, hey. Remind me where you guys are exactly. Well, you've been to Texas before? Texas. Okay, are you near Austin? No, we're not near Austin. -Dallas? -Dallas ain't Texas. -Houston? -Houston's another country. Why don't you just tell me where... Have you heard of Abilene? The city. Never heard of Abilene, no. Well, Abilene is about three hours from Dallas. Okay. And we're five hours from Abilene. Ladies and gentlemen... Hey. Hi. And while she could be quite a handful when she was a girl... I can't believe I'm talking about my daughter in the past tense. She was living in New York. She was finding her voice in music. And she finally found love. Ben Manalowitz. A successful writer and a regular contributor to New York Magazine. The New Yorker. But even with all his success, he always respected our girl for who she was. "Mama," she said, "you know how he has me saved in his phone? Texas." Well, as short as her life was, she found her voice, and she found love. And that's all there is, right? That's right. Let's hear from Ben. -Go ahead. -Go on, Ben. No, I couldn't. -Thank you. -You got it. -Brother, come up. -Please say something. Get up there. Father. Sir. I never expected to be in a situation like this. I'm sure none of us did. I wish I had known her better. I wish I had spent more time with her. I'm sure all of us feel that... right now. Yes. She loved music. I know that. I know that. She loved music. Yeah. And... ...she will always be a song in our hearts. "Song in our hearts." Phew. You damn near broke me with that one. ♪ It's those eight-second chances ♪ ♪ And cowgirl glances ♪ ♪ It's the blood and the glory, baby, that's why we ride... ♪ Now, I don't know about you, but... I know it hasn't been long, but I feel like me and you, we got a real bond. Kind of like family. Hundred percent. Wow. A hundred percent? Yeah. Yeah. I felt really close to you guys today. Don't just say that to say it. -Yeah. -I knew it. Abilene just didn't die. She was murdered. And the two of us are gonna avenge her death. What? You and me, we're gonna track her killer down and deliver vengeance. Okay, nobody said anything about a killer. An overdose? At a party in an oil field? Yeah. The girl never took so much as an Advil in her life. You know that. You know her better than anybody. Did you call the police about this? In Texas, we don't dial 911. Not even for, like, a fire? Fire or ambulance, fine. Who do you think did it? I got a couple theories. Cartels. Mexican gangbanger I got my eyes on. I mean, this is just the beginning. It goes deep. And what's this based on? Gut. Right. What's behind that though? Ain't nothing behind gut. Gut's behind everything else. Otherwise, who are you? I really think this is something for the police. Yeah. You talk about the police like it's just the same everywhere. Like the police is, um, McDonald's and justice is an Egg McMuffin. We don't have the police. We got Mike and Dan. You and me, we were the men in her life. And they fucked with the wrong two guys. Okay. Um... So, as, like, a personal boundary, like, everybody's different. Some people don't eat certain foods. You know, everybody... -I don't avenge deaths. -Mm-hmm. It's just who I am. I... You know, I don't live in a Liam Neeson movie. But you kind of look like a guy from a Liam Neeson movie though. Okay. Which one am I thinking about? It-it was a train. No, i-it was... -It was just on TV. -I don't know. Schindler's List. Oh, my God. You look like a lot of those guys in that movie. Yeah. Thanks. You know, that was my least favorite Liam Neeson movie. Huge downer. It was a really sad movie. Ty, I know that you're in a lot of pain. Oh, yes, sir. We both are. And you have a lot of anger. Goddamn it, I'm asking you for your help. If we don't do this, it's like leaving her body out in the middle of that desert for the rest of our lives. I know it the minute I saw you. 'Cause heart sees heart. Stay down here and avenge Abby's death with me. Oh, what a story that would be. Is this a pocket dial? I have a story. -Can it wait? -No. I'm in Texas. I'm on my way back from a funeral. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. It's okay. It's not someone I was close to. But you flew to Texas for it? Uh, yes. Uh, it was a girl I hooked up with a few times. You flew to Texas to attend the funeral of a random hookup? Her family thought that we were more serious than I did. Do you know what? This is a story. -Yeah? -Yeah. It's you. The-the... Your whole way of life. It's dating, it's hookup culture. How it enables disconnectedness. -The selfishness. -No. -The emptiness. -No. -The hollowness. -That's not what I meant. The lack of self-awareness. Okay, that's not what I'm pitching. It's really how sad your life is. Okay, now you're fucking with me. Listen, I'm in West Texas where this family just lost their daughter to an opioid overdose. That is sad but common. Except, her brother won't accept it's an overdose. He says it was a murder. Based on what? Nothing. And that's the story. This is an existential crime story. This is In Cold Blood, but there are no killers. This is about a new American reality that people can't accept. So instead, they invent these myths and conspiracies so they can cast themselves as heroes because... the truth is too hard to accept. The death of Abilene is about the death of American identity and the need to find someone to blame for it. This isn't just a story about vengeance. It's a story about the need for vengeance. The meaning of vengeance. Dead white girl? Holy grail of podcasts. Eloise, I wish my recorder were already on. He's saying such crazy things already. Her brother? He is such a character. And you can get close to the family? Can I get close to the family? They think I was her boyfriend. I mean... ...I went to her funeral, for God's sake. That's good. I mean, it's fucked up, but... but it's good for this. So? Okay, let's give it a shot. Oh! Okay, talk to me. Give me everything. Stay with the family, get as close as possible, record everything. 'Cause you never know what will be important. I'll be your editor, so I'll pull selects -and see what's there. -Okay. I'll have Tracy overnight you the equipment, but just use your phone in the meantime and get the story, stay safe. You got it. -Not in that order. -In that order. The dust in West Texas settles like rain on a lake. I'm under a West Texas sky, bright blue Texan sky, where I've just learned about the death of Abilene Shaw. My... A person... ...who lived here. Hell yeah, brother. All right. I'm gonna stay with you guys for a couple of weeks. I'm gonna record everything that you think happened to Abilene. -Okay? -Hell yes. Then we kill him. No. I'm gonna put it on a podcast... ...and it will be on podcast platforms. That's fucking brilliant. -Yeah. -You're fucking smart. All right. Once people on Reddit find out... ...they'll kill him for us. All right. Hey, Mama. Guess who came back after all. Ben. -Hi. -Oh, my God. You came back. Ah... Oh. Thank you. Um, I hope I'm not imposing. Please. We have this empty seat at the table. We can use all the distraction we can get. Can I get you anything? Um... Uh, just, uh, what's the Wi-Fi situation? Oh, it's a little temperamental-- it'll kick in. Did you have a chance to meet everybody before? Uh, no. I would love to. -Uh, this is Abilene's sister, Paris. -Hi. -She's 24, fixin' to be 25. -Yep. She's gonna be a famous filmmaker. It is a pleasure to meet you, Paris. Pleasure. I've heard so much about you. I've-I've heard... Yeah. And this is Kansas City. She's 17, fixin' to be 18. And she's gonna be a famous... Just famous. KC, I told you. Those are not our values. You have to be a famous something. A famous... celebrity. These are really your daughters? I mean, you all could be sisters. Oh. You are so sweet. You think that I look this fucking old? And this is El Stupido. -Sorry? -This is El Stupido. That's what you call him? Oh. It's okay, Ben. He don't speak Spanish. And, uh, and how old are you? Nine. Fixin' to be ten? Yes, sir. Boys, come on. -Ben, come take a seat. -Thank you. You have a lovely home, by the way. -Thank you. -It's really nice. -This is Granny Carole. -Yeah. Granny for short. -Um, nice to meet you, Granny. -Yeah. Thank you. Um... So, Ben, tell us about yourself. Do you come from a close family? Yes. Um, we're very close. We don't see each other much, but we're very close. You from Texas? Oh. No, I'm not. Oh, I'm sorry. That you're not from Texas. -Have you been to Texas before, Ben? -Yes, actually. I've been to Austin, uh, for South By. For what? Uh, oh, South by Southwest is an annual festiv... No, for what band? You don't just go to South By. You go see a band, don't you? Uh, well, true. I was part of a journalism panel about the future of new media. -Amazing. -That's so cool. -Mm. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Um, speaking of. Would you mind if I recorded this dinner? -Oh. -Record us now? -Yeah. -Hell yeah. Would we mind? -I love being recorded. -Great. Fantastic. Oh, my God. -Hey, smile. Okay? -Great. Well, would you want to hear the story of Texas? -Absolutely. -Huh? -Go, Granny. All right. Right here. -My goodness. -Mm. Okay. 1836. Texas is part of Mexico, made up of settlers and English-speaking white folk. And, uh, they didn't like the government. What else is new? Them Texans wanted to do things their own way. What else is new? So, you take everybody's two favorite things, government and Mexicans. And guess what happens. -Huh? -Go on. -Guess. -You should... In your words. All right. All right. Well, Generalissimo Santa Anna brung up 7,000 Mexican soldiers to fight against 186 Texan rebels at a place called the Alamo. And the Texans won. That's very inspiring. Say what? The Texans didn't win, Ben. Mm. They teach math where you from? 186. 7,000. Um... 7,000 is more, Ben. It was a massacre. It was unspeakable cruelty. Unspeakable cruelty. I'm sorry. I had no idea you didn't win the Alamo. Um... I feel like you guys talk about it a lot. Who's "Equinox Girl Cute"? Um, a friend. Who's "Paris Review Party Asian"? -Excuse me. Um... -Very good reading. Let me, uh... The Wi-Fi must have just kicked on. Who's "Natalie Bumble"? -Um, let-let me just... -Who's "Katie Raya"? -Let me put that on... -Raya? Let me put that on airplane mode. I thought Raya was supposed to be exclusive. So what do you think of this place, Ben? I love it. -Are you joking? -Are you serious? You love it? You're from New York City. -Literally nothing happens here. -Yeah. Well, um... I mean, it is a little... -Hmm? -You know. -Bleak. -Come on, that's not fair. -We just got a Target. -Excuse me? How dare you? Do you know how fucking good our football team is? -This is our town. -Okay, look, I don't know where to... where to land here. Um... Ben, there's probably something you should know -about this place. -Yeah. This is the most, uh, wretched, godforsaken stretch of land on the face of the earth. And I'd never leave. You know what I mean? Yeah. That's how I feel about Twitter. -Mm. -See, Ben's a journalist. One of the finest there is. He writes for the New York Magazine. New Yorker. Yep. And he's gonna help us find out what really happened to Abilene. I was saying we go out and settle with a .45, but Ben gives a whole new perspective to the situation. Ty, you can't solve something like this with a .45. It's not as simple as one person. It's a whole system, son. Tell us what you mean, Granny. It's the breakdown of society, is what it is. It's the breakdown of the school system, -the government. -Mm. It's the pharmaceutical companies. It's the breakdown of the family and tradition. Oh, there's a whole lot of people responsible -for what happened to Abilene. -That's true. -Yes, ma'am. -Amen. I think that's very wise. You're gonna need a 12-gauge, couple of ARs. -No. -Yep. -A Wesson automatic. -No, no, no. -And a sidearm for safety. -Yep. Exactly. -We're not doing that. Oh, we're not? Yeah. I didn't think you had the balls. Are you gonna help us, Ben? You know, um... There's some things I'm good at. I'm good at asking the right questions. I'm good at getting people to talk. And I'm especially good at drawing thematic connections between seemingly disparate elements and using that to illustrate a larger point or theory. So, whoever or whatever is responsible for what happened to Abilene, I will find this person or this generalized societal force, and I will define it. I'll define it. Bless your heart. I guess we have a guest room now. Ty. Well, rest up good. We'll meet in the morning and start to solve this. Yeah. See you in the morning. -Good night, Ty. -Good night. Good morning. Yeah, that's it. What else...? -Can I say it proves a lot? -Yeah. I'm gonna take a short break here, and during this break, I hope you'll call and support this station during this long, important -membership drive. -Thanks. We have some great free gifts to offer you, and I'm not just talking coffee mugs. Well, Ben, there's really two versions of life out here. Boom times, everybody's rich and busy. It's like one big party out here. And then the bust comes. It's really like two different places out here. It's always boom or bust. Which is it right now? Kinda in between. Yeah. Kinda in between, to tell you the truth. Okay. You son of a... -Get off. -Crawl. There's our worm. Oh, you like being on top. -Get off. Yeah. -Whoo! This the guy? Yep. Hmm. Let me save you some time: Sancholo. Sancholo. Sancholo. What's Sancholo? The guy who killed Abilene. A Mexican drug dealer. Evil motherfucker. You name it, he's got it. Not crazy about his prices though. So, you know who killed Abilene? Yes, sir. Did you call the police about it? Mike and Dan? Those lazy fucktards. Everything's an accident. Gun accident. Uh, driving accident. I've known Abilene since we were knee-high to a grasshopper. She never touched so much as an Advil, and-and then, out of the blue, they find this angel, this angel, dead of an oxy OD at a party he threw! Ooh, you're getting me warmed up. He's been obsessed with her since middle school. Yep. He'd call the house every night. They used to be on the phone for hours. He's just a piece of it anyway. It's too big to understand. You got deep state in bed with pill pushers, -cartels, pedos. -Uh-huh. -The law. -How, wha... Hey, shh. Hey. And you're a piece of it, too. So, um, I'd love to talk to some of the characters you mentioned. Mike and Dan? Sancholo? Oh, he's gotta be at the rodeo in Holliston. No doubt. There and the honky-tonk, too, afterwards. -That's where a drug dealer can do their best business. -Mm. 'Cause everybody goes to the rodeo. White, Mexicans. You really want to avenge her with him? I'm like a brother to you. Well, he's like a brother-in-law. Oh, come on. Ben, you ever been in a fight? You mean like a physical fight or like an online skirmish? I got him. Crawl wouldn't hurt a fly, would you, Crawl? I never understood that expression about flies. Yeah, I'd kill a fly, but what kind of sick fuck would hurt a fly? Make it feel pain? Hmm? You don't have any idea where you are, do you? Hmm? Want me to show you a map? Welcome to Texas. You are here. Morning, KC. Hey. Uh, would you like some coffee? -Sure. -How do you take it? In the mouth? All right, tell me something that you love about where you live. -Whataburger! -Whoo. -Oh. -Yeah. -Okay, great. Um, tell me about it. -You want to go right now? -Yeah, let's go. -Uh... Uh... -I'm ready. -You want... -Just, no, just, uh, tell me about it. You're gonna love Whataburger, Ben. -Oh, it's the best. -What makes it the best? Wherever you are, there's a Whataburger. Yeah. It's always right there. Okay. And then when you get there, what do you like about it? What do you get? -Whatever you want. -It's always right there. You could order whatever you want, Ben. Right, but there are a lot of places like that. So, let's say there is a McDonald's, a Burger King, a Sonic and a Whataburger all lined up. Which one do you go to? Whataburger! Right, right. Why? Because it's right there! Yes, but they're all right there. In this scenario, they're all right there. So, what do you get out of Whataburger? What makes it better to you? -What are you getting... -Ben. Asking why you love Whataburger is like asking why you love Christmas or a summer night or why you love your dog. I mean, you could point to the reasons, but the reasons aren't really the point. You just love it, and that's how love works. I'm on my way to get what could be some good local color. It's the place Abilene recorded some demos. I'm heading towards the Quentin Sellers Music Factory. A place in Marfa, the arts town, where... people pursue their dreams of musical stardom. His motto is "making dreams come true since 2018." Eloise, if you have, um... if you can play a clip of that, um, Rebecca Black song, "Friday," that would be really funny here. I bet it's cheap to play. ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ Okay. -Hi. -Hi. What is music? Like, singing and stuff. Yeah, that's right. Let's take a step back. I want to share an idea with you. There's no argument more profound than how the universe came into existence. -Oh, God. -Are we here because of God or science? I mean, it is, by its very nature, the most fundamental question. But there's one thing that everyone agrees on. And that is whether it was God declaring, "Let there be light," or an infinite particle of energy bursting forth in the big bang. Everyone, and I mean everyone, agrees that the universe started with a sound. Why do I call myself a record producer? I don't know. Yeah, I mean, we don't even make records anymore. What we're recording here isn't your record. It's your sound... on the record that started with the very first moment in time. So when you sing this song... ...I want you to think about how what you're making is the record of your time here on this earth. It's the sound that you scratch with your life... ...on the record of the universe. -Okay? -Okay. ♪ I finished my shift at Claire's ♪ ♪ Climbed up those steep mall stairs ♪ ♪ And the pain of having nowhere to go ♪ ♪ Pierced the skin of my soul ♪ ♪ As I sat on the steps ♪ ♪ And waited and waited ♪ ♪ For no one to take me home. ♪ Yeah. Thank you. I call this place the Factory. -You know, after Andy Warhol's Factory. -Hmm. Most people around here think it's a reference to C+C Music Factory. Which, honestly, I-I think Warhol would've loved, but... Yeah, actually. Yeah. I'm from out here. I went to college in New Haven. Oh, I went to school in Boston. Yeah, I thought about staying there, but this is the place that needs something like this. The problem isn't that people aren't smart. The problem is that they are. If the landscape is like this, a-and people were just boring, you wouldn't have this problem. The problem is, you get all these bright, creative lights and nowhere to plug in their energy. And so it gets channeled into conspiracy theories and drugs and violence. Who are your favorite music artists right now? Um... -Can I take a guess? -Yeah. You're a playlist guy. What does that mean? When some computer recommends you a bunch of songs based on your favorites, and a bunch more -based on your favorites of those. -Right. So you're listening to a bunch of music that, -I mean, you genuinely like... -Yeah. ...but you have no idea who sings it. Now, these playlists, it's like the dating app for music. You're not hearing other people's voices. You're just hearing your voice get played back at you. How are you supposed to fall in love? Art used to be in charge of us. You used to buy a whole album not even knowing what songs would be on it. Now we have everything on demand. At your
