(Jed) And if you're wearing trainers, they'll stomp on them. Bang ! And if your hair's too long, what they'll do is they'll grab it from behind. -All right. Stop! -And they'll just start. . . (sighs) You need to know about this stuff, Skunk. The better prepared you are, the better you'll do. So, what they do is they grab your hair from behind and they just start snipping away with a pair of scissors. -So you pick your moment. -Yeah. And you let them know the arrangement. Yeah. . . What? -The deal. -Right. And then they know where they stand. -Yeah. -Which is. . . -Nowhere. -Absolutely fucking nowhere. (laughing) -lt's funnier later on. -Okay. (Kasia) What about Rachel?

Come on ! -She's half your size. -Oh, fuck off, you paedo. (Mike) Go on, get out of here. Get out of my sight. -Hey, Sunrise, get back here. -What are you doing? That's my sister. -Stay right there. -Don't talk to my sister like that. (Mike) Come here. -Fucking queer. -Down there. Stand down there. -You, be quiet. -Why are you listening to him for? -He's a teacher, Sas. -Yeah, just get out of here! (Mike) For the next two weeks, you're gonna come here for. . . (Sunrise) Yeah, right. (Mike) Sunrise, look at me. For an hour and a half's detention after school, starting tomorrow. Do you understand? Good. Go home. (Mike) She had a bit of a run-in with another girl, but we sorted it out and everything's fine, so don't worry, it's. . . Mike rescued me. -(Kasia) Really? -Hmm. -Can l have a jam sandwich? -Okay. Go change out of your uniform first. (groans) (clears throat) Here, l'll. . . l'll get that. (muttering) Butter. . . You know, it's kind of weird, isn't it, when you're in the middle of something, how things can be so, uh, confusing, you know? -Unclear. -What are you talking about? No. Whereas, you know, what l'm saying is, whereas with a bit of time and a bit of distance and perspective, things kind of. . . Look, whatever you want. . . Sorry? A house, a baby, whatever you want, l'll give you. -That's very kind of you, Mike. -That's what l'm saying. lt took me, l don't know, stepping away. . . (Kasia) To get a perspective. Yes, and to realise that the things that you want, Kasia, the things that you want are, are the things that l want. Mike, l'm with Archie now. l'm sorry. (Mike) You're with fucking Ar. . . Archie? (Kasia) Yes. (Mike) As lovers? Well, what? Are you in love? Yes. Well, l'm s. . . l'm so fucking. . . l'm happy for you. l'm so fucking happy for you ! (Skunk) Mike. Mike? ♫ When l'm really old, one day ♫ One day, when l'm really old ♫ And when my hair falls out ♫ l'll stick it back with a spoon ♫ Of the marmalade that you made Mike! (panting) (sighs) What the fuck? ♫ When l'm really old, one day ♫ One day, when l'm really old ♫ We won't care who's winning ♫ Our wrinkIes wiII stretch to the moon ♫ When l'm really old, one day... ♫ (moaning) -What the fuck? -(Jed) Skunk. (Skunk) What were you doing? (Jed) You know what. (Skunk) Why? -l don't know. -Why her? l don't know! Just promise you won't tell anyone. All right. l just really. . . -You haven't promised. -l promise. l just don't understand why people would do that. -lt's what you do when you're in love. -You're in love? Well, l am. l don't know about her. -What if she's pregnant? -She's not. . . -Well, what if? -Skunk! (Sunrise) Whose could it be? -Simon Malloy's. -(Sunrise) Okay. Jed Cunningham. Dennis Woods. Jed Cunningham? -Yeah. -Ugh. Who else? (Susan) A couple of guys, l can't remember their names. -Who's that one with the dreadlocks? -Brian Williams. -He's gonna fucking kill me, Sunrise! -Shut up! Just let me think. (door closes) (sighs) (DC Carson) And when's the last time you saw Miss Oswald? Uh. . . Last Tuesday. Where? Outside the school. Uh, she was attacking another child, so l had to. . . Sorry, did you say Sunrise? -Sorry? -Um, Sunrise Oswald? Susan. -What did we say? -Susan. Oh, right, sorry, 'cause l don't know Susan. lt was Sunrise who l reprimanded. -(DC Carson) You don't know her? -No. Well, l mean, l know her, she's in the school, but l've never had any contact with her. (swallows) (DC Carson) l see. Well, she claims you've been having an affair. (laughs) What? Well, that's insane. She's a child. (DC Jenks) She's 1 4 years old, Mr Kiernan. She's also pregnant. -Mr Kiernan? -(teacher) Can l help you? -Mr Kiernan? -Yes. (child screams) (grunts) -lt's all right, don't worry. -Everybody, get out! (students screaming) (Mike grunts) Kids, out! (panting) (Skunk) Mike. (groans) -(Sunrise) They're coming, Dad ! -(gasps) (Bob) All right, all right, all right. Now, you know l'll be back, yeah? You know l'll make sure everything's all right, yeah? -l love you so fucking much. -Dad. Oh, thanks, love. And l love you so much, yeah? Give us a kiss. Come here, come here. Come here. Oh, come on. Let's do a big family fucking hug, yeah? -(Sunrise) l love you, Dad. -l love you so much. -l love you, Dad. l love you. -l love you, l love you, l love you. l love you, l love you, l love you. l love you, l love you, l love you. l love you, l love you. (Sunrise) l love you, Dad. Can you not cause a scene, all right? Saskia, no boys, all right? No parties. -Oh, fuck off. -(girls shouting) Fuck off, you cunt! (shouting indistinctly) -Girls, get back inside. -Get the fuck out of here! l've a right to call a solicitor, don't l? -(DC Jenks) Yes. -l'd like to do that now. (knock on door) Sorry. Uh. . . Mr Kiernan's solicitor's here. -So this is alleged? -(DC Carson) Yes. You haven't arrested my client? (DC Carson) For the moment, he's helping us with our inquiries. -Get your jacket on. -Wait a minute. (Archie) No. She's a liar. (DC Jenks) What? (Archie) She's done this type of thing before. Another man, another accusation, essentially of rape. Another lie. Look it up, Detective. So you have a decision to make. Either you release my client or. . . you arrest him. And then we'll take this matter further as her story falls apart. (Mike) Thank you. You can thank Kasia. She's the one that asked me to. . . (clears throat) Right. -. . .come in for you. -Yeah. How are you two doing? Well, l don't really want to talk about that. -Oh. Don't you? -No. (laughs) Why is that, Archie? ls that because what you have is so fucking special it can't be articulated, huh? No, it's because it's none of your business. Fuck you. You know what? Fuck you. The last thing l need beyond losing the woman that l love is to be obliged to the man who fucking stole her. -Well, l didn't steal her. . . -Yeah, well, you fuck. . . And there's no obligation. Oh, fuck off, Archie! Man, you couldn't be more fucking patronising if you tried. (Skunk) Then what? (Archie) l don't know, love. They'll probably give him some kind of DNA test. -Right. -Right. -You know what that is, do you? -Yes. -No. -lt's a test -that'll show he isn't the father. -But he isn't the father! -We know that, love. -She's a liar. Everyone knows she's done it with. . . lots of boys. -lt doesn't matter, Skunk. -Why not? Because they're boys. Mike is an adult. You understand? A teacher. ln this kind of situation, they have to be absolutely sure of his innocence. (doorbell ringing) And until they are, they just can't allow him to work with children. -So he's not coming back? -(Archie) Not at the moment, no. Sorry, love. Skunk, it's your boyfriend. Birmingham? But l thought. . . l thought you and me were gonna go to Florida -and see. . . see the lizards and stuff. -Yeah, l know, but. . . That was when we were older. Why not now, though? Because my aunt says l have to go to Birmingham, Skunk. What am l gonna do without you? -Here. -(sighs) -Will you take this? -Why should l? To remember me by. When do you go? Tomorrow. Early. So l'm not gonna get to see you again. How long did you know that? How long did you know, Dillon? ! -Skunk. -You're only telling me now! -Why haven't you told me? ! -Skunk, stop. You're an arsehole, Dillon. l wanted to tell you, but l was afraid to. Please don't hate me. You're leaving me, Dillon. 'Course l hate you. l'll always hate you ! (Mrs Buckley) Oh, it's lopsided. (Mr BuckIey) It's okay. (Mrs Buckley) No, it's not. (Mr BuckIey) It's fine. Fine? Well, l wanted it to be perfect. ls it edible? Well, of course it is. -Dave! -Well, the message is. . . is clear enough. That's all you want really, isn't it? Yeah, well. . . l suppose. Well, l'd better go. Hmm. He'll love it, Janet. Hmm. -(♫ drum and bass) -(overlapping chatter) -Fuck off. -Oi ! -(doorbell ringing) -Fuck off. ls anyone gonna get that? Saskia. (Saskia) You get it. (ringing continues) (Girl) Saskia. Saskia! -Yeah? -All right? Can l ask you something? -What is it? -Um. . . l just wanted you to know that, if you wanted me to, l'd be the daddy. -The what? -The. . . the dad. Uh. . . Of the baby. T-Take responsibility for it. -You and me, we could get married. -Jesus Christ. -Are you being serious? -Yeah. Jed, we're having a party in here, all right? -Just don't call over again. -But. . . (Archie) Skunk? Are you okay? (Skunk) Why didn't you tell me and Jed about you and Kasia? (Archie) l'm sorry. -l was trying to find the right moment. -Are you gonna marry her? -l don't know. -Kasia, l know you're there! -Are you? -l don't know, love. Because she'll leave us, Dad, the way she left Mike. Like Mum left us. Like everyone does. -No, l won't. -Yes, you will ! Don't lie. lt'll all go wrong, Dad. Everything always goes wrong. -Why do only bad things happen? -Good things happen. Like what, your sex with Kasia? -Skunk, listen. -What about me or Jed or Rick or Mike? -What about Mike, Kasia? -Skunk, you need to stop. l don't want to talk to either of you. Just get out! lt's my room ! So let's, as much as we can, confine things to the home for the weekend, okay? -Yes. -Just to be safe this first time out. -Thank you, Doctor. Yes. -Not at all. -Best of luck, Rick. -Thank you. Have a great weekend. (♫ dubstep) Susan. Susan. Susan? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Susan. Susan ! There's blood everywhere. Why is there blood everywhere? (Sunrise) Call an ambulance! Call an ambulance! -Susan ! -Call a fucking ambulance! -What's the fucking number? -999, you twat! (Mr BuckIey) I wonder if she means we can't have a kick-about. (laughs) Hmm. Wouldn't mind a bit of a kick-about, eh, Rick? l think l'd rather stay inside, Dad. Oh, well, yes, you're probably right. Best to. . . Best to play by the book. Oh, Mum's made a cake that's. . . lt's. . . lt's a bit lopsided. Just, uh, thought l should warn you. (chuckles) (police chatter on radio) Well, what's going on here? Nothing changes. (sighs) Well, we won't let it bother us, huh? Hello, my baby. Hello. (Mr Buckley) What's. . . What's happening? (Mrs Buckley) Oh, just don't pay any attention. Um. . . What are you doing? (Mr Buckley) Well, l've got to. . . l forgot the milk, so just put the kettle on, l won't be long. -Why isn't she talking? -Let's just get her in the ambulance. (Saskia) She's not even moving. (paramedic) Move out the way, please. (Saskia) Just hurry up and get her in there. (Sunrise) Just tell them. (Mrs Buckley) Rick. Come on, Rick. Just. . . Just come inside. There's nothing going on there that's of any interest. Come on. You getting a good look, are you? Right, let's go in. Let's go in. -(Saskia) Pervert! -Rick, come on. . . lt's 'cause of fucking scum like you that this is happening. -(Mrs Buckley) Just go inside. -You sicko! Go on, just piss off inside, you fucking pervert! Fucking evil bastard ! (Saskia) You sick. . . Cup of tea, love? Hmm? Where are you going? -To. . . To my room. -But. . . -Just. . . Just for a little. . . -But l made you a cake, love. -l'll have some later, Mum. -But you just got here. Rick, please don't go to your room. Please, don't. Don't mind what those people say. Please, don't. -But they're right. They're right. -No, they're not right. They could not be more wrong. Rick, you are kind and you are good ! -They're right! -You are so good. -No, they're right, Mum ! -No, stop it! Come back, Rick! Don't go to your room ! Don't go, Rick! Oh, hello, sir.
