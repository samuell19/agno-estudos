"Xing Fa Long." "Xing Fa Long Weavers." Hey quit pushing around, don't you know how to read? A little bit. See that? "Working area, no intruders." I am no intruder, I am here to look for someone. Get lost, I think you are from Gui Lian Tong. Gui Lian Tong? I asked you to leave. Do you want to get thrown out? Throw me out? Who? You? Right. What are you doing? This kid is trespassing. We wanna teach him a lesson. He is unreasonable, I came to look for someone. Who? My brother Wang Hon. What? He has a relative too? Alright, come with me. Stand still... Supervisor. Wang Hon's in your team, right? Yes. Someone is looking for him. Take him there. Supervisor, please teach me. Follow me. Stand still... He looks okay. What did you say? Nothing... Go in there yourself, he's working but don't take too long. What's this? It gives out a tune. Just asking, stay calm. What is this? A country bumpkin like you wouldn't know. This is a gold watch, for telling the time. Brother. Brother. Brother. Oh, how come you're here? It's noisy here. What did you say? Ah Hong. Where are you going? I'm working so I can't stay away too long I'll take you to my place and see you after work. When do you get off? I work till it's dark. By then I could starve to death. Get some food to eat frst. Then wait for me at the entrance of the machine room. Don't run around. Brother... Do you have a round object that makes a ding dong noise? It's called... For telling the time. No. That's for the rich, not me. Why do you ask? Nothing. "Yuet Lai restaurant." Just think how long have you been with Xing Fa Long? At least eight years, right? Your record of service should be acknowledged but you are only in charge of thirty machines that's a mediocre reward. Once you are in Gui Lian Tong's textile mill things would be different. Birds of the same feather flock together all bosses are the same. Old Yang, Gui Lian Tong is run by the Manchus I hear they would do everything possible to make Xing Fa Long to close down so as to manipulate the workmen. Where did you hear this from? Our boss Ha He Bu is very friendly he is also generous you could bring over a hundred or more workers. Li Kai, frankly speaking you should know what's good for you I'm not afraid of your threats. Bill please. Thank you... Come back soon. Don't tug at my clothes, I've worn them for three years and they are easily torn I'll hit you. Why? This kid kicked my butt. Look. Really? He went in to eat for some time already. God knows when he did it. This is strange your bottom was kicked yet you didn't know? Kid, what kung fu style is this? What? Kung fu? Who wants to kick his bottom. Is his bottom that attractive? You... Alright... forget it. I know this kid. Who is he? Supervisor with Xing Fa Long. What an upstart. Can't believe he doesn't know when he was kicked at the bottom. Supervisor Li. Are you taking us to Gui Lian Tong soon? I see. Ha He Bu gave you that gold watch. Chen Zheng, I told you not to play tricks. I... Supervisor... Let's go... see you tomorrow. Brother. The shoes are too big, have to fll it out at the toes. I'll talk to the supervisor tomorrow and ask for a job for you I am not eligible to work on your machine. Of course not. You'll do odds and ends and learn. How much would I earn? Money is no use back home but it is essential in this place. Someone is teaching kung fu over there. He's no good, if I teach them... Guan Feng Yi. Brother, you are new and not familiar with the bad people here. You'll understand slowly. Listen to my advice and don't show your kung fu. Go to sleep. "Destined for Imperial Lineage." Look, our products are not as good as those woven by Xing Fa Long. Even if the merchants give me face I can get no business. I want to get the men from Xing Fa Long... Boss, that Li Kai could not be bought. I have done my best but Li Kai is on good terms with everyone and the workmen listen to him. There are two things which everyone has to listen, regardless of who he is. Understand? Yes. If we can't coax them, we'll use force. What's so urgent that you have to come at night to see the boss? Our competitor wants to grab our workers what should we do? You have a kind heart. Boss He. That's enough... remember to water them daily with just the right amount. Yes. Boss He, are you doing some gardening? You don't know that I put six top notch crickets underground and they will beneft from the energy of the soil. Right. Boss He. Your crickets are invincible. Stop being so sycophantic. Last year I was no match for that kid Wang Bai Wan I'll teach him a lesson this year. Yes... What's the matter? That bastard Ha He Bu is going to use force. Frankly, as long as I feed you you should work for me. Yes... boss, don't worry. Yes, you are right but if Gui Lian Tong pays more our men would be induced. Nonsense. Are you saying I am stingy towards my men? Li Kai. Go. Please offer him a job. What's your name? Guan Feng Yi. How old are you? Any experience? Nineteen, no experience. Then why come look for me? Damn. The boss pays me to manage his affairs. Do I need to mind your affairs too? Supervisor, as long as you agree to take him in the old arrangement applies. The wages from the frst three months are yours. What a joke, that sum is so petty. Do you know the rules? What rules? Please instruct him. Firstly, don't stir up trouble secondly, don't be lazy and third... Hey, the supervisor is more arrogant than an offcial. What can we do? He's the boss. Work hard and don't give me any trouble. The supervisor will teach you personally today. So pay attention. Stop. Supervisor... Your stance is not frm you'll walk into trouble if you want to stop my cart. Where did this man come from? You knocked over chief instructor and should apologize. Chief instructor? If he could be knocked down by me he isn't much good. He is young and ignorant please let him off. Come and bow to supervisorTan and apologize. Me? Bow to him? Bow or I'll beat you to death. Mr Tan, please forgive me I knocked you over and hurt your bottom. Fire him. What? After I have bowed? Why should I bow to you then? Supervisor... Come here. Supervisor Li has vouched for you, work hard. Thank you. Go away... Please. Your brother knows kung fu? No. No? He knocked down supervisor hard. He can't even hit him back. "Yuet Lai Inn." Triple six... Foreman Chen, thank you but we must listen to Foreman Li. It's up to you but it wouldn't be easy to deal with boss Ha. Well? Want to beat us up? Let's go... Let's drink don't bother with those ignorant people. Afterwards I'll treat you at Tao Yuen restaurant. Cheers... let's eat. Folks, a treat from Mr Chen. Defnitely must be poor. Come with me, let's talk this out nicely. Who are you? I am in charge at Gui Lian Tong. There's nothing to talk about. Wait. Have you seen the boss while working at Xing Fa Long? At Gui Lian Tong it's different. The boss is eager to see you. What's the big deal just seeing boss Ha? We aren't afraid anything. Please. I heard you refused our offer? What do you mean by this? This is what I mean. You've broken their arms? Don't play around. Brother, bear the pain. Were you shouting just now? Quiet. Your hand is broken, alright, bear with it I'll set the bones for you. Get away. Your wrist is broken, your hand will be useless. Who could be so cruel? Gui Lian Tong. What the hell is this Gui Lian Tong? Just shut up, will you? No. Brother Wang, please, help my brother if he loses one hand he can't work. Thank you. Feng Yi, we're just concerned about our own affairs and don't mind others' business. Boss. Since you taught those guys a lesson it's been smooth. Of course, I only need to say the word and I could get twenty to thirty people no problem at all. Right, bring them over tomorrow and make it a party, understand? Yes. Hey hold on, do you hear me? Those willing to go to Gui Lian Tong follow me. Let's go... Just leave, why smash the machines? Shut up, smash it. Let's go... Quick, tell Foreman Li. Let's go. All here? Yes. Well done. Go and see boss Ha. Right... Well? Was I right? You can see boss Ha once you're here. Such an honour! Let's go... Wait. Chen Zheng, you can leave if you want but I must keep these men. Look at you... You want to fght? Foreman Li, fear not, I am here. Bastard, get lost. Let's go... Fight... Hey, wait for me. Let's go back. Supervisor, lucky we have him otherwise, we'd be in great trouble. The workmen will continue to leave. Pretty good kung fu for your age! Now with that bastard Chen Zheng gone you fll his post. You have done a good job. Just tell me what you want and I'll ask the boss I am not looking for commendation it's just that Foreman Li was good to me so I went to the rescue. The supervisor asks if there's anything else you need. A pair of shoes. A pair of shoes that fts. A new pair of shoes... Look, new shoes. Xiao Ying, I have been promoted to foreman I will have more money this month and I will also buy you new shoes. Don't feel bad. As the foreman I can get a job for your brother a job that doesn't require manual labour. Brother, I have new shoes I am returning the old pair to you. Hey, you know what happened I have been promoted to foreman I only had a small fght and could be foreman. It seems my kung fu will bring me fortune. Why don't you say something? You wouldn't even look at the old shoes? Why? They are old and worn. I heard from the supervisor that. Gui Lian Tong is up against Xing Fa Long and they could use someone who could fght. Your kung fu is better than mine, so why... Don't talk to me about this. They'll treat me to a meal tonight, brother... Come... Come... The fact is there is nothing we can't discuss. Right, I fear our men are fghting to death for their master. Let them be, having these men is merely like keeping dogs I don't care if they're dead or alive. Instructor Wang, the boss is inside. Are you tired of living? Boss, it's not my fault... Boss, I didn't do this... Boss. Beat up anyone from Xing Fa Long. Do it again. It's no good you're not practising kung fu; It's more like knitting. Even chief instructor didn't say it's wrong I don't care what he has said if you learn from me you have to listen to me. What kung fu have you learnt that you're so proud of? Well said. It's the Hung style. My kung fu may not be very good but with useless fellows like you even twenty or thirty of you are no match to me. Try if you don't believe. See? I told you. You wouldn't even be able to defeat ordinary men not to mention those from Gui Lian Tong. Let's go. Your wounds have recovered? Not really, about thirty of our men have been hurt by them. Yes, everyone is of the opinion that even if there is treasure at Xing Fa Long we need to keep our lives to get it. Stop fghting... Someone got killed. Quiet... one by one. Supervisor, we quit. Even foreman Li is beaten to death we are so frightened if we go to work. What does boss He think? You should let us know. Yes... I'll go to see Boss He. Stay calm. The boss knows what to do. Boss. I know about everything that's been happening. You're Xing Fa Long's chief instructor what do you say? We'll sue Ha He Bu. Bullshit. He's a Manchurian and is a relative of the magistrate. Suing him, what a rotten idea! If they could beat us up we could beat them up too. There's indeed one person who could. Then do it, don't let me lose face. Yes... boss. Li Kai is survived by his wife, mother and kid the situation is pitiful. What's that got to do with me? I didn't kill him. Yes... I tell you, my money is for the living not the dead. If anyone could beat up Ha He Bu's men I'll reward him greatly. Yes, I'll tell the man accordingly. Wait. Who is that person you're referring to? That man is called Guan Feng Yi, and is quite young. His kung fu is good, last time he... Yes. The supervisor from Gui Lian Tong is here and wants to borrow eighty weaving machines. Could there be such a thing. They have even brought men to carry the machines they are waiting for you inside. If they see me there'll be trouble I'd better hide for a while. What's to be done? Well? Is there no one who dares talk to me? There is, me. Who are you? Foreman of Xing Fa Long. Right, I want to borrow eighty machines. Alright, I'll have to ask frst. Ask who? This guy wants to borrow eighty machines. Would you allow it? No, what about you? No as well? Guan Feng Yi, foreman Li died at his hands don't let him get away. You're so polite I didn't promise to lend you the machines. How kind of you to bow and kneel. I want you to admit losing. Who else wants to borrow the machines? Bravo. Boss. Tan Da Bao. For how many days have Ha He Bu's men been beaten up? Four to fve days. It's been peaceful these few days. The court advisor was hosting a banquet just now what a coincidence I ran into Ha He Bu. That look on the bastard's face it's really something. Naturally, whoever crosses boss He is asking for it. I hear you dared not show your face that day. No... When I arrived it was all over. You can't fool me. That kid the other day I said to give him some perks did you do that? Yes. A man like him is useful. Yes... Didn't you hear me knock? I... Never mind. I kicked down the door and came in just the same. Did my brother come here? He... wouldn't come. You can't even take care of such a small matter. I'll look for him myself. Forget it. He has to work tomorrow. It's not too late now. It's still early, I don't believe his tattered place is better than mine. There are plenty of rooms here. Ask Xiao Ying to move in. Look at this place. When it rains it's leaking everywhere. My place is well equipped. And besides, nothing I have is ill-gotten. You may leave. You both leave too! Is there anything else you could say? Leave. If you don't want to move in I can't do anything about it but please don't ask me to leave. Foreman. Mr Tan, you are a supervisor why behave so reverently towards me? Little master, you must be joking. You are a star of the boss. To able to talk with you is my privilege I got all this by fghting. Little master, shall I take you to a few fun places in town? What's so good about these places? You haven't tasted sweet girls yet, have you? Tasted? Could I eat them? Damn, let me widen your horizons I tell you, boss He is a regular too. Let's go. Stop. Put it down. What's the matter? Boss He. Quick, get out of here. Ha He Bu, you are an outlaw. The fst is my law. Let's discuss it. Alright, listen I want to monopolise the business. Xing Fa Long has made money for decades so there should be a change. I... What sort of customer is this? As long as he is happy, you know. Boss He said he'll pay as much as he spends. Really? Old sir. Boss He. Quick, help me back. Who is he? Ha He Bu. It's you. Has your instructor recovered? Let's go, don't bother with his kind. Consider this your lucky day. What technique is this? Crane's beak from Hung Fist. Want to try again? Let's go... Boss He, luckily I brought Guan Feng Yi here or it would have been disastrous. Luckily I survived Ha He Bu's attack. You were so scared just now when seeing him I let him take your supervisor's place. Boss, so... What? Come with me, I'll highly reward you. Thank you. Little master, please help me. Boss He, there's many complications at the textile mill and I am not much experienced. You are the supervisor, use whoever you want. Let's go. Thank you. Guan, look. My crickets have a red head and a black body they are called Guan Kung. I think they're gonna be invincible in this town. You've been with me these few days and you feel bored, right? Don't worry, I know how to take away your boredom I'd like to return to the textile mill tomorrow. Alright, come back before dark Xiao Guan, I was beaten by Ha He Bu you must avenge me. Don't worry, boss. Is supervisor Guan here? Yes, you want to see him? Let me report this. Yes. Please. Supervisor Guan. What's your name? Tan... Da Bao. Please give me an opportunity to work. How old are you? Any experience? Forty eight, I have been a supervisor. A supervisor? So what do you want me for? Damn. Am I paid to serve you? If you could... Never mind, I still care for a small sum of money. Do you know the rules? Firstly, don't stir up trouble. Yes. Secondly, don't be lazy. Yes. Third, ain't allowed to wear new shoes. Yes. Did you check out the background of that kid? Yes I even went to his hometown he's an orphan and his teacher is an old man. Practising Hung fst, his kung fu is good I've no idea why he's hiding in the village. He has a brother whose kung fu is good too. Where is he? I don't know. His brother's surname is Wang, and he was an instructor for the salt merchant in Yang Zhou. He's famous, but left without a farewell nor a trace I told you to recruit fghters and you have failed. Everybody knows about the matter of master Lung. No one dares bother him. I can handle him. I've got an idea. Brother. Brother, you're buying wine. Come, I'll buy you a drink. Why didn't you tell me that you are no longer working at Xing Fa Long? I'm talking to you. You are now successful, you want to beat me up? Brother, how come you... Listen to me, pack up and go back to your hometown. Brother, are you joking? Look at me I've been poor since I was a child. Now... You were still who you were even though you were poor but now you are no better than a dog. You... C'mon, let's go and have a drink. Alright... Boss, what can I do for you? Chu Hong, there's someone that I'd like you to seduce. You want to get rid of me now that you are tired of me? Nonsense, a young man is good for you. He's only a kid. A big kid. Only a big kid like this will fall for you. Work hard on it. Is he coming back often? He doesn't come back at all. He stays at boss He's place. Boss He has also got a woman for him Xiao Ying, forget about him. He's changed. I don't blame him. He told me that he has never had shoes since he was a child. His frst pair of shoes were Brother Wang's. The shoes were too big and he didn't know what to do with them. Now he has a better life of course he needs... Damn it... Cut that crap or I won't give a damn for you. Please don't. You run... You want to see me? What do you want? Spill it out. How can you say that? We accept defeat. Our master Lun would like to meet you Lun Ying Tu? Have I not beaten him enough last time? Supervisor Guan, you shouldn't say that. You meet friends in a combat. What are you talking about? He was lucky that I didn't kill him to avenge for Li Kai. Let bygones be bygones. Master Lun regretted this too. This bastard Ha He Bu wants to get rid of Master Lung when he saw that he's broken his leg. That's why Master Lung wants to see you to tell you of Ha He Bu's conspiracy against Xing Fa Long. Really? Did I not tell you that we all accept defeat? Master Lun sincerely hopes to make friends with you and give you a big credit in this matter. Supervisor Guan, even before master Lun was crippled he was no match for you. Now, he's got only one leg what are you afraid of? Alright, where's he? Supervisor Guan, what an honour to have you here. Not yet better? I must have used too much strength I was at fault too. Supervisor Guan, come and have a seat inside. Please... You wanna inform me of Ha He Bu's conspiracy. Is that it? Supervisor Guan. This is according to Boss Ha He Bu's instructions. Come, help me dress up. Bring me a pair of new shoes. Why? Having a date? My date is right here, I've other business to deal with. Sounds nice. Your breathing and heartbeat are nice too. How come there's still no news from them? Better go check it out. Right. Guan Feng Yi is here. Boss Ha, long time no see. Your gold watch is more stylish than mine. If you like it, go ahead, have it. Not bad, the time is quite accurate. Boss Ha, this watch indicates that it's your time. Go, Lun Ying Tu has succeeded. That bastard is wounded. He's just slightly wounded. Boss, we better... Dummy, look at him. His belly is all torn apart, what are you afraid of? Go. Yes, Lun Ying Tu ambushed me. But still I have to kill you. What's the name of this style, remember? You're quite good. It's called Iron fngers clasp throat. Remove the cloth from his body. See how bad this kid was wounded by master Lun. Throw him out in the wilderness. Yes. Master. Guan... He's dead. What? Guan Kung is all well, why do you say he's dead? There'll be a duel tomorrow; Damn you for lying. No, I mean Guan Feng Yi. He's been killed by Ha He Bu. If he can killed by Ha He Bu. What's the point of staying alive? How many men have slept with you? Are you going to cry for everyone who dies? True, I've slept with countless men. But it's just him that my heart cries for. He's the only one to say my heartbeat sounds nice. Boss He has taken back the house. Nothing at all, just like a dream. Despite Ha He Bu's relation with the magistrate. He's committed murder so he went hiding in his homeland. But in less than a month. He will come backjust like nothing ever happened. Homeland? Yes, he's got estates back home. Put it down... I win at last. Haven't I told you many times to put it down on the ground. Yes. Boss, someone's been awaiting you for a long time. You are? Guan Feng Yi's brother. Then you must have better skills I can use you. You've ruined Guan Feng Yi, you want to destroy me too. Nonsense, I destroyed him? He had nothing in the beginning I provided him with everything. And you say I destroyed him? You know, if someone 'destroyed' me like that I'd thank him no ends. He once had a life, but now he's dead. Then he was not skilful enough, he was to be blamed. It's not my fault. Go... get out. You... You are right, he alone is to be blamed. Who are you? I am Guan Feng Yi's brother. If not for the ambush, you couldn't defeat Guan Feng Yi. Bullshit, what's such a big deal about Guan Feng Yi? He died by my Iron fngers clasp throat
