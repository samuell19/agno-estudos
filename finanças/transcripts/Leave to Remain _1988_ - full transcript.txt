[music playing] [whistle] [non-english] Pakistan. Iran. [non-english speech] [gunfire] [non-english speech] There's not enough there. No. There's not enough there. This is from your tutor? Please, he says about the money. Yes, we know the problem. Don't quite see why he's written again. Do you have a current bank statement? As a woman, you must understand. My country's no place for us. Miss Mohamedi, we must have proof of your ability to pay your fees. We can't wait another term. If the delay's with the authorities in Iran, then I suggest you take the matter up with them. I've been here for six years. My father is a rich man. There is no reason. We'll write. Normal? Normal. Just tick the box. About two hours. Is this thing working? Try hitting it. What did he say? Ta. Turned out nice, didn't it? Miss Mohamedi? This is my very good friend, Mr. Johnston. Please, please. Uh, I told Mr. Johnston you have problem. He say, no problem. He's English. Unfortunately, he has no work. But, Allahu akbar, he has a house in Chelsea, a rich family, he's kind, and he likes Iranian-- but not Khomeini. Um-- it's a squat. Uh-- it's not our house. It's just a place we use. - In Chelsea? - Yeah. Well, that's the main thing, Mr. Johnston. I know property. This is my business. Uh-- there's no carpets, or anything. It's just, uh-- Oh, please. That's not important. My husband will live in my house. That won't be necessary, I think. Ah-- well, I don't mind. I'll sleep anywhere. Stand me in the sink, if you like. Uh-- where do you live? I was in Kensington, but now Notthing Hill. Ah, I think I've seen you down there. On Sundays. Down by the embassy. No. I don't go there. Uh-- I said something wrong? Mr. Johnston, embassy is bad place. Always making trouble. Spying on people. We do not like that. We'll have to be like you. Free, do as we please. Uh-- [non-english]. [non-english speech] Hm. [non-english]. [non-english speech] Goodbye, Mr. Johnston. The Iranian people owe you a great debt. I hope you have a very pleasant evening. Goodbye, Miss Mohamedi. [non-english speech] Uh-- who's that? That's Shah. Ah, yeah. Oh. Jesus. We're getting ahead. Hm. - Is this hers? - Mhm. Hey. Good evening, sir. Good evening, madam. Your tea. What's this? You want one? I was just telling, uh-- they're three for a quid. Have a look. I'm gonna take them down Oxford Street tomorrow and fleece the tourists. You sell these things? Yeah. Sometimes. You crazy, mister. Nobody wants this. And you got funny hair. Lucky I'm here. You'd buy anything. It's just a casual arrangement. A hobby, really. I don't-- she a friend of yours, or something? I come here a few times, yes. I look all right, don't I? Yes. Of course. Look, if you don't like me-- Oh, no, no, you are-- Blonde. Blue eyed. Handsome. Yeah, they all say it. I'm part Scandinavian. Never offer me a pint of lager. I thought if I pay something-- What, a deposit? You on the run? I can't pay my fees. They stopped your gyro? I had a feeling. I don't get it. How much are your fees, then? I must go. Any chance of a lift? Car's up the road. I have to meet some friends. Thank you for the evening. [non-english] [applause] [non-english] [non-english] Shahin. This is Nick. He is going to write a letter for me now. It's your aunt? Well, she's got a good case. I can't see there'll be any problems. Is there any news? I'll miss my bus. Shahin? [non-english]. [non-english speech] I'll leave you to it. No! Stay! If you want to help us, you must learn about Iranian people. Javad is a revolutionary. That's why he stands here talking about politics, while his wife sits in a kitchen making dresses. You know how much she gets paid by her bourgeois boss? One pound each dress. One pound! For my niece in Iran, too, Javad. Not here. We must make a life where we are. I don't like him. He's Englishmen. Men can be difficult. They are not like us. I don't ask permission, Henry. Not yours. Not Javad's. Every week, my father goes to ministry in Tehran. To ask about my money. And every week they give the same answer. [non-english]. It's a mistake. Our papers are lost. They will write soon. Just like home office. They are playing with me, Henry. Because I'm a woman. Because they don't like what I study. I don't know. I won't play this game. I want my life. You must be important person if Khomeini do this. He's a busy man. I'll need the room. When? A few weeks. I'm not sure. I have enough money for two or three months. Longer, if I'm careful. I didn't know [inaudible] in Iran. I've never seen his house. His family. That's what makes it so hard, not knowing where he is. I imagine all the places I have been. Shahsavar. Isfahan. The hills outside the city. But he doesn't come. Do take Shahin Mohamedi. Do take Shahin Ma-- Ma-- Mohamedi. Sorry. No, no. Just repeat the oath. Do take Shahi-- Christ. Mohamedi. Very difficult for English. Please, mister-- Romina Orastafar. Would you not interrupt? I've not done this before. [laughter] Perhaps we should go back to the beginning? Now that everyone's relaxed. Well, I think I can say that's the longest wedding I've performed this week. It's a good sign, I'm sure. [car horn] And then he said something funny, and I could not stop laughing. Shahin, this is for you. Thank you. You look after Shahin, Henry looks after you. If you cause trouble, we kill you. Shahin. Hey. Congratulations. Bye bye, children. You want to go? She thinks she's in England. [singing] [non-english speech] This is James. Guran, Nasrin, Akbar. Cheers. Hands across the ocean. Cheers. Where to, sir? Just leave it there. [non-english speech] Please, today for James, we speak English. [non-english speech] Oh, shit. Was I supposed to take off my shoes? Now you have to go to kiss him. Just press this. [non-english speech] OK. Um, best man? Best man. [non-english speech] Guran is our very best man. Police don't have his picture. You smile. Look happy. Cheese. Yeah. Is that all? Koronovsky. I forgot. Not my favorite color. Blue. They're new. They must be worn. They're not going to come snooping. They've got better things to do. Why can't I sign on? You're supposed to have money. Am I? Oh my god, what have I done? You'd better know what you're doing. I hope you'll be very comfortable in my house. It'll do. All right. Party time. See you at the karate club. MAN: Hello. Do you want to eat? I mean, you've had a revolution, right? And what happened? You kicked out one guy, and got another one who reckons he's God, or Allah, or whatever you call him. Khomeini. Yeah, him. Hey, your English isn't bad. Give that man a banana. No. I mean, where's it got you? It's a cock up, innit? I mean, you're still stuck wandering around, sleeping on floors. Oh. Right, so I've been down in London for about 18 months now, and I've done all the pubs, and the clubs, and the discos, and all that. And I've met a lot of interesting people. Hundreds. Like, every day this bloke turns up at the squat line. Has anyone got a drink on? A drink? I'm a bit pissed. Uh-- [inaudible] gone, then, eh? Oh, ta. Thanks. Cheers. Yeah. Yeah, right, this bloke, he turns up-- he'd hitchhiked from Greece. And I walked, and, uh-- he gave me a few addresses. Cause I told him I was planning a trip. You know, Europe, Africa. I made up a bed. Do you want me to put him to sleep? This place-- What did you put in his drink? [ringing] I'll get it. JIMMY: Sleeping on floors. Oh, and-- [non-english speech] Open it. OK. [non-english speech] Beer, too. Why not? Beer. Merci. [non-english speech] Let me know. Look, I'm sure that [inaudible]. As Iranis. [inaudible]? Come and sit. [laughter] Vive la France! [non-english speech] [non-english speech] Vive la France! [whistle] [heavy breathing] [singing] [non-english speech] Here. [non-english speech] Merci. [non-english speech] How is Mr. Johnston? Must cost a fortune. Oi! There's a whole stack of empties in there. Must been a leaving party, I suppose. Didn't say who he was going to rent it to? Oi! Get off! Pack it in! Stop it! The people moving into these places have got to be loaded, I'm telling you. You must know a few. Do you think I'd marry you if I did? I'm talking about Iranians. There wouldn't be much pull in you marrying an Iranian, would there? Anyway, you're married. Oh, yes, I forgot. Stupid Shahin. Now, I just need a couple of contacts. Preferably with an oil well or two, but I'll settle for a car. I mean, all this coming and going, there's gotta be a car going to spare somewhere. I mean, your lot leave rollers parked at Heathrow for six months. This is Arab. What? At Heathrow. [non-english]. That's what I'm saying. I'm not Arab, and I do drive. Oh, yeah? Cycle to Harrods, do ya? I prefer Marks & Spencer. This is Jewish. And I walk there. I don't know every Irani in London, and they don't know me. Until I get my VISA, I'll have to keep it like this. I'm not supposed to be working, remember? Then what are you doing it for, then? To pay for you. [car horn] Another 20. Thanks. How've you been doing? Feeding the 5,000, or something? - Try hitting it. - I know. Not your lucky day, is it? I'd go home if I was you. When [inaudible] was already here, there were parties, demonstrations. Meetings. So many meetings. We didn't know what else to do. We wanted to be there to see it. - Why didn't you go? - I talked about it. Some of my friends went back. I decided not to. It's a long story. Anyone special? Hm? Your friends. My parents. Did you enjoy your meal? Yeah. What was it? [non-english]. It's a very beautiful Persian dish. I'll teach you how to make it. I'd have come back. I don't think so. I would. Things like that don't happen over here. I mean, can you imagine a million people marching up to Buckingham Palace, and telling the queen to piss off? Forget it. They'd all just stand there, waving daffodils and singing songs. It's a flower. You know, like a tulip. Makes you sick. As for the church taking over-- maybe a bishop, I suppose. Archbishop of Canterbury. Can't see anybody being scared shitless of him. Unless, of course, he started pulling a few fingernails. He's got you, though, hasn't he? Khomeini. Up here. Let's not talk about this. It's too late. See what I mean? I mention the guy's name, the room goes quiet. It's boring for me. There is more to life than politics. Iran is not just Khomeini. We've got poets. Singers. Beautiful things. If you want politics, then go to Iran. Here it's a game. All they do is fight each, other blame each other. And it is dangerous. English people don't want to see this. We are guests here. It's all right. I've got my clothes on. I signed one of them petitions the other day. Against the tortures, and that. Tottenham Court Road. They'd never heard of you. Did you give address? Yeah. Well, every little helps. You're going to put them under your pillow? [non-english]. I have to sleep. Give me some for the [inaudible]. Do them all. The Iranian intellectual love this place. I have to go. Oh. Mina. These are beautiful. Beautiful. Thank you. Khomeini. [non-english speech] Don't try to change the world in one day, my friend. You have nothing to do tomorrow. Every Iranian is not like Mina. Uh, the podium. Cheers. Hi, Akbar. Hey, Mr. Johnston. You came to beat me for stealing your wife? Here. Give some to your friends. There's food, dancing-- This is not for you. Everything is in Farsi. Well, they can eat in English. [non-english speech] Come. Let's go. Hey, new? Oh, yeah. Fancied a change. Oi, do you know anyone who's got a car? She won't like it. Hang on! I'll-- I'll bring it back. Hi. Fancy seeing you, you little wanker. Ah, give us a hand. Christ, I stink. I could really use a bath. I just got back from Spain, and my period's just started. Well, what are you doing here? Ah, this is-- a friend of mine. Shahin. Come again. Shahin. Oh, you're not Spanish, are you? Sorry, that place is the pits. Where's she from? Ah, where ya from? Iran. Want to come for a beer, or something? Bring your friend. - Ah, no. No, we-- we gotta go. I'll catch you later. Aw, fuck you. What a creep. He asked you to marry him yet? [car horn] Oi! Come and have a look at this. Looks like he was expecting someone special. It's a custom. You know what? I reckon it's the embassy plumbers going to bug the place. Bandad says they keep tabs on people. They'll be few deals done in a place like this. The whole place is crawling with 'em. Stop it! Stupid questions all the time! I'm sorry. What got into you? Listen. When my money was stopped, sometimes they'd do this. Because they think you're against them. To make you go back. I have a family in Iran. Friends. If they think I'm involved in-- if they think-- What is it? It's nothing. I'll go and sleep. The community here is very small. People talk. You mustn't tell anyone what I do. Where I go. I don't know why this has happened to me. Someone must have said bad things. We must be careful. OK. Mum's the word. This is the wrong place. I'd better go and see Bandad. Don't be late. Knees up with the comrades. [gasp] Is Mr. Johnston there? No, he's not. I have no light. Two days now, I go to bed early. Today I'm not tired. What are you doing, stupid thing? Shoo. Shoo. Shoo. Can you reach? It's not very safe. I'll hold it. You marry Mr. Johnston for VISA? I've got you. He's my husband. He was away. It wasn't easy to see each other. I understand. The English, you know-- these people have ruled the world, and they know nothing. You're safe here. Please let me down. Your hand is shaking. You all right? - I'm fine. And the Lord said-- [music playing] [non-english speech] [non-english speech] No, merci. [music playing] [applause] What now? I want to go home. We just got here. Mr. Karlovsky knows. We've got to talk. OK. Far away. Not here. He's a policeman. We have them over here. They help old ladies cross the road. You're beginning to cramp my style. I don't know this. - What? - Cramp, the word. What does it mean? Cramp? Christ, you're thick when you want to be. Anywhere else you fancy leaving tonight? There's a pub up the road. Got big swing doors. You could be out of there in seconds. What I mean is I don't like being told what to do. You do what you like, but you don't mix with Iranian. This is not for you. I'm interested, that's all. I've got an inquiring mind. It's a very English habit. [car alarm] Oh, shoot. Come on! [car alarm] [shouting] [car alarm] [shouting] Pack it in! Stop it! [siren] Are you all right? Yeah, yeah. [non-english speech] I was looking for Akbar. How long have you been married to Shahin? You're crazy. Stay at home. I don't want dead soldier in my kitchen. Why do you dress like this? Do you think you're in Lebanon? You got a mirror? Not for this face. Sit. They were trying to bust up the meeting. If I hadn't been there, someone could have got hurt. You must know who they were. Do you want to do something about your mouth? Oh, I give up. Mr. Johnston, let me tell you something. We foreigners fight each other all the time. Do you know why? Because you English fucks us up. Ow. That hurt. Pleasure. Get lost. She's got a fucking weird sense of humor. Come on. I need a drink. You go. Do you want a divorce? He's so strange. He follows me everywhere. Everything he does is-- is such a mess. His hair, his clothes. And questions. All the time, he asks questions. He is a man. How is the job? I don't know. Shahin. Are you complaining again? Yes. I'll give you somethign to complain about. Choosey chicken. This stuff's gotta be nearly ready. Oh, hi. I borrowed your stuff. Well, you should see the water. Boy, was I duty. Oh. Uh, where you been? Why is she here? Sorry. I'm Ellen. Jimmy said I could use a spare room for the night. Well, I'm heading north tomorrow. You don't mind, do you? Listen, I think it's great you guys are married. Sounds like you could use some protection around here. I stopped off in Japan. Oh, it's really pretty. You should go sometime. The food isn't much, but they've got beautiful mountains. Funny thing is you expect everything to be really small. Hey, piss off. She's interested. Oh, I dunno. On a bad day I ask myself, why am I doing all this? I could be at home, in my own bed. Do you know, I've been in 15 different countries since September. It's crazy, really. Sometimes I dream of finding a little place by a river. Settling down. Shit, Jimmy, you couldn't find your way to the bathroom. I'm going to bed. You know, that really pisses me off when people do that. Hey, I'm not keeping you up, am I? No. I'll make some tea. Let me. No milk, and plenty of sugar. Right? Tell me about Iran. [non-english speech] Get out. What? Get out! Oh-- Where am I going to sleep? I told her-- you know, that we're-- You can sleep on the sofa. The sofa? I'll never make it. And the buses aren't running. Take this. Oh, I could get a cab, I suppose. Come on. Ooh-- Come on! [laughter] Get-- let me go! You pig! Ah! Get-- [laughter] Oh! [groaning] Oh-- what did-- what did you do that for? I've lost me hearing. Promise. [muffled voices] ELLEN: I'm trying to get some sleep. JIMMY: Ellen. [music playing] Listen-- about last night-- You were drunk. I didn't think it'd be like this. You know, living in the same place. Having you around. It's not easy. I fancy you. Let's not talk about it. Oi. You got any toast? This thing's covered in glue. You don't want it? No, I want some toast. You know, a couple of slices, under the grill. A bit of butter, a bit of marmalade. You don't do toast, right? Hey, where are you from? France, right? I go into a restaurant in Paris, order breakfast-- what do I get? What you ordered. Croissants. Think about it. Smart ass. We gonna do these pictures, or what? I don't know. What, packing it in, are you? I'm not surprised. Takes you all morning to load a camera. Does that mean I can sign on, or do I have to clear it with the special branch first? All right, I only asked. I'm worried. About Bandad. The changes he makes to his flat-- they are not for his people. I don't know why he does this. I thought you went to see him? He wasn't there. I don't get you. You won't let me meet any of your friends. I don't even know if you've got any friends. Beats me why you want to stay here. I want to work. I want to wear what I like. I want to choose who I spend my time with. You think we could do this in Iran? Sit in a coffee house, joke about the police? You sign petition, but you don't read it. Look, if Bandad's a problem, why don't we check it out? You don't understand. I can't ask him if he works for our enemy. It's an insult. We don't have to see him. Come on, I'll get this. [clattering] Aw! You need some info on a bit of real estate, ask the builders. They'll know who's moving in. Probably be able to tell us what they had for breakfast. Shouldn't I knock first? All right, all right. It's open. You are a dog. Anyone home? Hey, I just heard there's a bloke in there. A priest. It's the fucking Ayatollah. Let's go. Hello? What's going on? This place is sold. There's nothing for you here. Please. Please. - Wait a minute. It was on the list. You got a payer? It's a mistake. [non-english]. Please. Another time. Please. [non-english speech] I didn't know you were a-- she's Iranian. I'm just passing through. He speaks no English. [non-english]. Go. Please Go. Miss Mohamedi, I am a businessman. If you want a little piece of home, you have to have a little piece of Khomeini. She thinks you've been talking. Me? I gave her a job, I find her husband. What more does she want? [non-english speech] Perhaps if she covered her face, there would be nothing to talk about. Don't you see that his [inaudible] are the government? The priests? Not over here they're not. What if he tells them what we've done? Look, if Bandad's selling to the people that are trying to get you deported, then he's not going to tell them that he's fixing so you can stay. Use your head. I think this is your lucky day. I signed for it. [laughter] From home office. They want to see us. In Dover. [humming] Sucre. No. Aw, I give up. [non-english]. You must try to remember. Try it once more. Look, I've never met your mother, for Christ's sake. Why pretend? She's in Iran. Look, we met at a disco, we decided to get married. I'm English, you're my wife. That's it. Will you put this on? Oh, you've got to be joking. Mr. and Mrs. Johnston. I'm sorry to drag you down here. London likes to keep you busy when the ferries are quiet. If I could ask you to wait outside, Mrs. Johnston? Not you, sir. You stay where you are. Now, there's a coffee machine in the corridor. Twos, fives, tens. Any trouble, give it a thump. James? Will you take these? - Aye. You get good weather? Oh, we haven't been away yet. Ah. Won't be long. Right you are, Mrs. Johnston. Nice day for a sail. Nice wedding snaps. We get to see a lot of those. When did you decide to marry, Mrs. Johnston? Two or three months ago. It was raining. You were still at college? No, I had finished. You had applied for a student VISA? We saw you in May-- what, two or three months ago? But you know this. I couldn't pay my fees. James wanted to wait until I was able to complete my course. To me that wasn't important. I think it's a woman's job to be with her husband. To make a-- a home. A family. Where was this taken? Is this your flat? Jim's a photographer. This was a place he took some pictures. - He didn't take this. - No. I did. It's very good. We have got a lot in common. We've received a letter alleging you married Mr. Johnston in order to obtain a VISA. Now, before we can accept your application, we have to be satisfied this is not the case. But who sent this letter? That I can't say. I'm afraid it means you'll have to postpone your trip to Spain for a few more weeks. He was a right bastard. Do you know what? Do you know what he said to me? He said, uh-- what is it? Oh, yeah. He says, um-- are you and your wife planning a family? Christ. What a sod. I can't believe it. Fucking cheek, I nearly hit him. Hey. He didn't say anything like that to you, did he? Because, I mean, we ought to talk about it, just in case. Someone sent a letter. Yeah, I know. Probably Karanovsky. Touchy lot, these Poles. But why? Why would they do this? Aw, forget it. I'm proud of you. It's not easy to deal with these bastards. Stick with me, eh? You're laughing. Well, you never know who's watching. Let's go. Where are you going? To the station. We can't go yet. We gotta celebrate. You know, you're very beautiful. You're so-- you know what? There used to be a girl on the telly like you. With, uh-- Turkish delight. She had eyes. Come on, let's leave the country! Ha ha ha! I love my wife. I do. I love her. I just-- she doesn't understand me. Hey, uh-- I think she's got another man. Yeah. But I don't mind. Really, I don't. It's just-- it's just not fair on the kids. Certainly, Mr. Arafat. James? James? Ah! Oh! James! Oh, please! Stop it! Oh, please! James, please. Listen. Please. Something is happening. In Iran. I feel it. My family. I'm frightened. James, help me. Please help me. I'm not going to hurt you. Just relax. Please, I can't. I can't! Don't talk about it. Look at me. [inaudible] Promise. Come on. Promise. Promise. [whistle] [music playing] [gunfire] [groaning] JIMMY: We need coffee! Bread! There's no milk. I'll have to borrow some. Bandad owes you. I don't care if you have to wear a bucket over your head. We need the money. We are married. It's what what married people do. [non-english speech] Don't start that. You got anything to say, say it. Keep the funny talk for the home office. I'll do the shopping. I've got a couple of quid. Leave it. Clothes. I'll get arrested if I go out like this. It doesn't have to be this way. It could be nice. We could go places. Do things. Mohamedi? [non-english speech] [non-english speech] No. No. [non-english speech] [non-english speech] We've had a visit. Two of them. Polish guy let 'em in. They must have been watching the house. It's a bit of a mess. What have you done? I'll give you a hand. Leave it. I was trying to help. What should I have done? Just go. Who's this? Someone. What? Someone I know. It's nothing. What do you mean, nothing? There's boxes of them over there. These are my things. Just answer the question. You have no right to be here! We agreed. - Tell me who it is. - You dont'! You don't! I can't explain! Who is it? It's my fiance. Your fiance? Huh? Jesus. I'm stuck in here all day in this pantomime, and you're out there with your fiance? You don't understand. He is not here. - Not a word. Not a mention. Give me those. No! No! [non-english]. If he touches you, I'll kill the bastard. You understand? You don't understand. He went back. He wanted me to go. I couldn't. I couldn't. I was too frightened. You think I got into this cause I've got nothing better to do? Is that it? Oh, look-- it's pissing down. I'll just go and get hitched before the shops shut. Hey? This has cost me. I could be-- I could be halfway across Europe by now. Off with that Aussie slag. - Why don't you go? - Don't give me that. You wouldn't last a week. You really-- you really reckon you can pull it off, don't you? Stay here, and tart yourself up, and land some cushy job. Well, it's finished! There are no jobs! Use your eyes, for Christ's sake. All the smart people fucked off years ago. I can't believe this. Every time-- every fucking time-- I married you. You're my wife. No one looks over me. No one. All that stuff about you protecting your family-- you were covering for him, weren't you? Your big hero. Out there. Fighting for freedom. Well, I got plans, too. And I'm not fucking laying about. Oh, fuck! Shit! MAN: When you change your address, you've got to notify us within seven days. Bring your card down to the station, and ask for the alien-- We'll try and sort it out for you. But I sent all papers to home office. 6. 84. Shahin? What is it? Is this yours? Look, mister, she doesn't finish for three hours. She's got work to do! These people want to eat! This is crazy! What my boss will say if you kidnap my woman? MAN: We'll talk to your boss. He's OK. Who's that? Customer. Why are you taking her? Lost her way, has she? Let's go. I asked you a question. Shahin! If I were you, miss, I'd go and have some chips. She has traveled 2,000 miles alone. She has no friends, except us. She wants nothing from you. Whenever she is ready, she will go back. Why are you treating her like an animal? Now, wait a minute. [non-english speech] Jesus. Excuse me? Any chance of a bit of action around here? Guy up front's run off his feet. What's going on? [alarm] [shouting] [siren] Hey. Easy. Easy. OK? Yeah? Wait. Henry got her false papers. SHAHIN: Why won't they leave us alone? [non-english speech] [non-english speech] Jamsit has been arrested. Can I? It has been a bad day. A bad day. Drink. When he left, I was so angry. I couldn't find a reason. Why? Why does all men-- they've got no laughter. Nothing gentle. Then the story started. Torture. The killing. Jamsit brought simple things. Sometimes, after he then back to the mountains, he sent me a little flower. I could smell it on the paper. All that way, and it was still there. There was less and less about me. About us. I had to do it, Henry. I had to try. Otherwise I was just running away. Jamsit? Roman's taking Mina to Manchester. They all go Saturday.

She ran away. Happens all the time. I'll think about it. [knocking] It's for you. I need to talk. Open the door. Shahin? Two minutes. It's the squad. Please! Look, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Shahin? Open the door! Open the door! Please! We are closed. Shahin! Shahin, open the door! Open the door! Shahin! Shahin! Yeah, was that you? Did you write all this?
