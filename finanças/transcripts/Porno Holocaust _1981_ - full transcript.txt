Hello, guys. Hello, captain. -Yo, cappy. Jacques, I hope everything's in order? You do a good job? Sure thing, captain. When do we leave? In the morning. Our passengers arrived on the noon plane. What's wrong, Jacques? Well, sir, you know that bringing civilians aboard brings bad luck. Plus I just don't like all this mystery. I know how you feel. Give the men a couple of days leave, and remember... no strangers are allowed on board. And especially no reporters! Don't worry sir. I'm gonna go see those people. I don't know how the five of them are gonna fit into one tent. Three of them are women. -Woman?! We must be crazy! You know what they say about women. They really bring bad luck! It's worse than that, Jacques. They're scientists. Can you imagine what kinda monsters they are? Goodbye, Captain. -I'll see ya tomorrow. Excuse me. I'm looking for the members of the scientific expedition. They're up there by the pool. Thanks. Good morning. Captain Hardee? Yes. I'm Annie Darmona. My pleasure. And you must be. Let me guess, the biologist? My field is nuclear physics. I'm Professor Lemuan's assistant. Disappointed? No, on the contrary. Neither physics nor biology are my strong points. Do you want a drink? No, thanks, I'm on duty. I thought that only applied to policemen. And sailors, too. Bravo! Come here, I want you to meet a real clean-cut sailor. A pleasure, captain. The pleasure is all mine. I never thought Science was so interesting. Are you the biologist? She's the zoologist, Dr. Dorcin de San Jack. Oh excuse me Countess de San Jack! Thank you, my dear. Even the Navy has its good points, captain. Are you the one who's going to take us to the island? Yes, the Minister has placed me entirely at your disposal. Magnificent! Perhaps you can take me on a tour of the islands? Naturally, if you'd like. Pardon me for a moment. You again, Benoit? You want me to call the military police? You can't do anything to me, Captain. Fortunately, we still have freedom of the press here. Oh come on, I just need a good story. Sorry Benoit, but there's nothing here to see. Besides, I don't even know what's going on myself. Lies! I'm sure something big is going on here and the public's got a right to know. Well, you won't get anything from me. Goodbye, Benoit. Captain, this isn't over yet! Captain, wait! Forgive me. He's the press correspondent here. It's very hard to get rid of him. Now what were we talking about? I must confess I really don't know why you're going to that island. My orders are to bring you there and give you whatever help you'll need. I'm just the taxi driver, nothing more. Maybe we can explain it to you, would you like that? I will admit I'm very curious. But not without Professor Lemuan's permission! Please Countess, don't be so mysterious. This whole thing is becoming ridiculous. Up to now we've had no scientific facts, only a theory. We have those photos, Annie. They're not just a theory. Those photos were taken from a naval plane. Are you sure you don't know anything about this? No, that's basically it. The Minister gave me explicit instructions not to talk to anyone. But for awhile now we've been hearing of strange things happening on that island. For a while now? But they only notified us a month ago! The Minister thought if we reacted to the rumors, we'd risk making fools of ourselves. It might just be a tall tale told by the fishermen. You know the people around here, with their rituals and black magic tend to lose sight of reality. Look! What could have done this to him? No sea animal can do something like this. Oh God, may he rest in peace. We told him not to go near that cursed island. He went there to kill the monster, to avenge his son's death. Come, let us bury him at sea. The sea can keep many dark secrets. Do you want to take a shower? I'm finished. Thank you. Hmmm, I've never seen that underwear before. It's very sexy. Simone, you know I hate it when you make stupid remarks. Wait, I've got something here. It hurts. I don't see anything. And you don't feel anything here? Simone, I'm in a hurry. The Minister is waiting. Simone! Calm down! Come on... No more! I came... According to this evidence, the problem appears to be very serious. Crabs, turtles and rodents, all of enormous size! This would seem to verify the rumors about biological mutations to the animals there. That's what we have to investigate. Minister, Professor Keller is too much of a perfectionist like all biologists. We physicists are not so rigid. You physicists are also responsible for those horrible mutations. Minister, your report says you sent a plane up to take photographs after a long series of... shall we call them, incidents? Excuse me, but why did you wait so long? Frankly Professor Lemuan, I don't believe what those fishermen say. They use dynamite to catch fish, sometimes a fatal accident occurs. They blame the deaths on a demon, to avoid responsibility themselves. But one of them, a man named Keno, has told of a monstrous creature on that cursed island a monster that murdered his son. That is all fantasy Professor. An old superstition. But we have photos and the examination on the dead child. The island's been deserted since 1958 when we evacuated the tiny native population after the island was chosen as a test site for nuclear experiments. Since then, we haven't allowed anyone to live there. Is it possible that a few of the original inhabitants were left behind? Perhaps someone living in a remote area of the island? Strange that you would believe such an absurd theory! No one could have lived through those atomic explosions. Minister, I was one of the physicists who worked on that experiment and ever since that day, I've asked myself if we had the right to do what we did in the name of Progress. We unleashed a terrible force, the extent of which we do not even know. I'm not seeking exoneration, I'm just trying to rid myself of a nightmare the possibility that these mutations may have affected a human being! Pardon me Professor, perhaps I seem a bit blunt but they keep bothering me from Paris. The truth is I don't enjoy finding myself involved with a bunch of scientists and all these security measures. I understand. We'll try to keep out of your way. On the contrary, I want to help. I'm assigning you to Captain Hardee and if necessary, I'll send a second boat out to the island to help you. Thank you, gentlemen. Come in. Hello. Why don't you lock your door? What for? I've no fear that someone might come in and fuck me. In fact, I wish they would. I see your lover has disappointed you again. But he always tries. That's enough. Where's Annie gone? She's busy. Would you believe she went out with that captain? She beat you to him, eh? If you want another, just keep acting like a bitch. What a whore you are! Such language? I'm shocked. Come on don't play stupid. Let's not fight, eh? Let's fuck. For you, captain. Eat hearty! You're wondering why this place is so peaceful. I've been wondering about that myself. I think it's because there are so few tourists here, and so little noise. It'd be the perfect place for a couple looking for privacy. The people around here don't go to a restaurant like this that offers the home-made cooking they can get at home. This is home-cooking? It makes me want to move here permanently. It's fabulous! The lobster's not half bad. Tastes like it came straight from Japan. What if the tourist people hear you? You surprise me, Captain Hardee in a good way. I didn't expect you to be so friendly. You're just getting to know me better. Have you noticed I'm as nervous as an Olympic athlete? Sure. And I've been wondering why. Y'know, the big lie about sailors is that they have a girl in every port. I never thought you'd be such an interesting woman. That's ridiculous. Do you think I'm different when I'm in Paris? Do you think just because I'm a scientist, that I've forgotten how to be a woman too? I don't mean it that way. But as impossible as it may seem at this moment I feel we could be in a restaurant in Paris. Of course, some things would be different. Instead of this lobster, we'd be having hamburgers. Hamburgers? What kind of place would you take me to in Paris? Hey! You think I could afford to eat lobster in Paris on my salary? Calm down. Let's not talk about hamburgers. That's what I eat every day at the hospital commissary. But let's talk about us. Do you have anything planned for after dinner? Sure. We're going to go see a great show. I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Do we have time? I don't like to eat in a hurry. Don't worry. We'll have all the time we need. Perfect. What a beautiful city! Isn't it interesting? Yes, very. But not nearly as interesting as a place I've discovered. Is sex all you think about? Ah, we're here. I think this is the place. Have fun then. This kind of thing's not for me. Come with me. It'll be an exciting experience. It had better be, for what I spent to find out about this place. Sorry, but I don't have the courage. Or maybe I'm just too pure. Well, do as you like. But I'm not missing out on this chance. Bye, -Bye Come in miss. You have to pay in advance here. House rules. Wait until you see how you'll be satisfied. Here. I have two fine specimens here. Well, here we are. It's about time. Oh, those potholes! That road is pretty bad, but you'll really enjoy the show. Give me the champagne? Come on, I've reserved two seats in the front row. I'm glad you got a day off before the trip. I didn't want to leave without seeing these islands. It's very slippery. There are a lot of sharp rocks here. I've never seen so many. Be careful. Oh, my shoe! Here. Forget it, leave it like that. Let's stop here. No one will bother us. You were right. It is a spectacular sight. What a beautiful sea! I'm going for a swim. Will you join me? No, I'd prefer to sit here and watch. But I'm not part of the show. I think you are. Let's just say you complete the picture. The water's incredible. Why don't you go in? You are so amazing. I want you so bad. Pierre and Jacques aren't very disciplined, but they're fine sailors. And, above all, they're very trustworthy. Captain, did Professor Keller introduce you to his wife? Not really, but I know everything about her. She is Dr. Simone Keller, biologist. Bravo captain! I've heard so much about you. For example, that you made a big impact on my colleague. When will we arrive on the island, captain? Just before dawn. Is it that far? No, but we will change our course a few times to avoid being followed. You never know. Do you think there will be any danger from radioactivity? I don't think so, not after all this time. We'll take a reading though, as soon as we get there. How long will we be staying there? A couple of days. I really don't know what we can do there other than take a few readings and samples. I'm sorry... But is that how you scientists spend the taxpayer's money? You sound like a politician on a campaign. Let's consider the evidence here the photos and the testimony of those fishermen. The aerial photos suggest the possibility of biological mutations. If we accept the fishermen's stories as truth that possibility is doubled. Or maybe it's all just a wild story in which case we're all having a little vacation at the taxpayer's expense. But this island could hold an unknown danger that we are not prepared to confront. I say we turn around and go back. You may be right, Professor. But did we need to hear a speech? You should have discussed your fears with the Minister. I did! God knows I did! But no one would listen. And now, here we are in this little boat preparing to grab the Devil by the horns. Keller, you're so boring. Would you rather go to the island on a cruise liner? We're only going to take samples. We're not going off to war. It may not be a war, but it's something abnormal. I'm sure the Minister wouldn't react this way to a bunch of fishermen's tales. All this security... passing us off as tourists... changes in the route. I'm convinced there's something strange going on here. Oh come on Keller, why are you so grim? Simone, what's worrying your husband? Doesn't he ever relax? We'd better get some sun now, before we get to the island. Have fun! We're on vacation! A beautiful trip on a tropical sea! Pity it will all end tomorrow. Lemuan is right. You really are boring. Tomorrow we start working seriously. From that point on, we won't have time to go swimming. That's for sure. Listen to me, I know what I'm talking about. Don't argue anymore. -Enjoy the trip, like I'm doing. Oh, shut up. That's the way I am. Please just leave me alone. You don't know how to take a joke. Aw, just forget it. Are you enjoying yourself? Yes, very much. When we go back I'm going to spend a couple of days relaxing and seeing the sights. Simone, will you be staying awhile? I'd like to, but we have to return to Paris immediately. Look! There's your island. You mad at me? Do you think I am? I haven't talked to you all day. You're talking to me now. I hate having that stupid Countess thinking I'm an easy lay! I'm not an easy lay. I'm just a guy who likes you a lot. If I didn't - There's hardly any radiation at all. A lot less than we'd predicted. We can all relax. Great! The island is so peaceful. Stop for a minute? I want to take a photo. Nothing at all. The island looks dead. You look nervous? What's wrong? Nothing really. I just have a feeling that we're being watched. Is your conscience bothering you? It's your own sense of guilt. How about you, Annie? Have you noticed anything? Nothing at all. Not even a single insect. No signs of birds or rodents... Yes. Let's go on. They haven't returned yet? No. Why are you staying by yourself? Your pussy still hurt? More than you know. Those black bastards really busted my hole. But what a magnificent fuck! You'll have to be strong now. How will you survive on this island for a whole week, without any sex? There are always new experiences. What are you doing? I have a surefire way to keep us both happy. The boat's on the other side of that mountain. We've explored about two thirds of the island now. Well, I think we should return to camp. Me too. Maybe we'll come back this afternoon to get a few samples to analyze. It'll be cooler then. Hey, why don't we eat some crabs tonight? There are plenty around. I hope I'm wrong about this. What do you think, professor? No, you're not wrong. It's incredible! What a surprise the Countess will have! Captain, would you pick up a few of those for us? I'm finished. Now it's your turn. I still can't explain this scientifically. All I can do right now is classify and preserve the specimens because we don't have the necessary instruments here. My husband and I will have to get back to the Institute lab before we can formulate a theory. Pardon me. I may not understand this zoology and biology stuff but I've seen thousands of crabs around here. And they all look perfectly ordinary to me. This “ordinary" crab is a Cretinos Enano, a midget species that usually grows to a maximum length of 2 and a half centimeters. But... this one's more than twenty! 22, to be exact. The radiation, I assume? You assume correctly, captain. If you want to know more I suggest you go talk to Lemuan. It's men like him playing games with the atom who are sending this whole world straight to Hell. Let's stop here and fuck. -Hmmm, I like that. Our tests detect radiation in the water, but at extremely low levels. Are you saying that someday life may return to this island? Yes. We've looked everywhere and we haven't found a trace of animal life. Only these strange looking crabs... It's possible that after the atomic explosions some species died altogether, while others may have mutated. And that bothers you? It's our only hope really. Some of the animals on this island may have become nocturnal. And maybe we can find some specimens. Pardon me, I don't mean to be rude. But how much longer will we have to stay on this island? However long it takes. If you don't mind my wife and I would like to leave the camp for a while to go off and study some things on our own. Will you assume personal responsibility for your safety if you don't stay with the group? Of course. Find anything? Only a few small fresh water plants. I think the life forms here have started to mutate. Do you see the strange coloration of this plant? Yes, it looks carnivorous. The Countess will be able to confirm that. I'm so tired. Let's go to bed. We'll finish up tomorrow. We're going to be awfully cramped in there. 80? Does that bother you? Simone, what are you up to now? You know this place gives me a strange sensation. Are you afraid? It makes me feel something else. Give me a little kiss, professor? Simone Please! What's wrong? Are you afraid that someone might see us? Then tell me where you would like to fuck? Oh, God professor. That was marvelous! It's about time! Yes, it certainly was marvelous... You see, we may not like this island but we've turned this trip into a honeymoon! That was the first real fuck you've ever given me! Our first fuck, eh? God, I'm all sweaty. And I'm so thirsty. We need some ice cold champagne to celebrate! I'm going to take a dip in the water. Wait a minute? Hurry back. I'll be waiting. I won't be long. Hey, professor. Is that you? Where are you? Jacques, come over here. Why're you laughin' like a fuckin' idiot? Those two guys got two women like that, and look what they're doing. Playing poker instead'a fuckin'. My grandpappy was right. What can I say? They're very studious people. Yeah, the Captain's been studyin' too. When he came back with that lady doctor, you should see his face. Well, it's none of our business. Let's go pick some fruit before it gets dark. Yes, sir. I'll see ya back at camp. OK You go that way, and I'll go this way. OK boss. What the hell was that? Quick! Let's go see. Let's split up. Captain, I'll go this way. Alright. I can't go on. Here, lean on me. To whomever finds this notebook; My name is Antoine Demaduro. I had no time to leave the island before the first explosion. I'm going to live in this cave... ...with my wife and child. May God have mercy on us, Monday, the 19th of September 1958. I just came from the dock. The boat is gone! The ropes were broken. The currents swept it out to sea. We're trapped here. What do you think happened last night? I don't know, but I'm sure it was something terrible. My men don't lose their heads so easily. And what about the others? No sign of them. They all seem to have disappeared, including Annie. My God, that's strange... Look! There's Keller. He's dead. We have to look for Simone. Their camp must be up there. Yeah. Let's go. Who could've done this killing? I don't know, but I'm sure it was no animal. How can you be so sure? I don't know of any animal, except for a man, that would fuck a woman before killing her. No, it's not possible! I can't believe... a human being was responsible for these murders. Captain, we're in great danger. What do we do now? First, we have to bury these bodies. Then we'll go back to the camp. Annie may still be alive. In a couple of days, there'll be another boat coming by to look for us. We have to make a plan. Yes, we have to stay alive until the other boat arrives. Meanwhile, help me dig these graves. I found my men. I just finished burying them, or should I say what was left of them. I can't understand it. Who is attacking us? Oh I found a small boat hidden under some bushes. Well, that's good news at least. No, it isn't. Why not? Now we can get off the island! It's too small to carry the three of us. One big wave, and we'd be shark food. Wait, Captain. Maybe that boat came here from a larger ship to get water and provisions. No, that's impossible. Fishing is not allowed within 50 miles of this place. Then how did that boat get here? It's just one more mystery we can add to the others. Maybe we should eat some of these? That's not a good idea. I'm no botanist but the fruit here has an unusual look. The radiation? Yes. Do you agree, doctor? It's better not to risk it although eating meat in this heat isn't a good idea, either. Yeah. We don't have the utensils, anyway. I think we should keep moving. When it gets cooler, I'm heading south. Still hoping to find Annie? We have to wait for the ship anyway. Shouldn't we set up a defense? I just can't figure out who that mystery man is if he exists. The captain is right. I agree with him. We have to try to stay alive. Yeah, we're not gonna just sit here and wait to be killed. Lemuan, there's some whiskey left. Want a drink? No, thank you. You know I don't drink. My God, what a barbaric situation! Look what's become of us. We're like wild animals trying to survive. You're losing your dignity too, eh? I suppose that's easy for you to do. Depends on the circumstances, Lemuan. Find any good ones? Up to now, I've just destroyed my hands. Want some? I'm sweating already. Your loss... Be careful, you could get drunk. Afraid I'll lose my respect for you? Wait, I'll take care of it. Hey, where'd you learn to do that? Where do you think? Sorry I asked. Come on. Fuck me? No, thank you. Why, you afraid? Drink and you'll feel better. Wouldn't you like to fuck a countess? It might be your last chance. Tomorrow we might all be dead... dead! Understand? Benoit! Now I understand. That was your boat I found. Who did this to you? A cross between monster and a man. He was dressed in rags. C'mon, I'll take you to our camp. No, Captain. That bastard broke every bone in my body. Let me die in peace. You'd better go rescue the woman. Woman? What woman are you talking about? The dark-skinned girl. She was a member of the expedition. Where is she? Up there, in a cave. Listen to me, Captain. Don't go up there alone! Where is it? I don't know. We'd better hurry. Let's go. Get behind me! No, Demaduro no! Let's go! We're out of gas, water and food. I'm afraid the current is taking us to God knows where far from the shipping lanes. It's so unfair. We escape from that monster, only to end up like this. You know what you do in a case like this? Just make believe that everything is OK. Oh, really? Sure, my love. How would you like a nice continental breakfast? Scrambled eggs with 2 big slices of bacon. You're so silly. God what I wouldn't give for a meal like that! Then God bless the captain of that ship. Hey! We're over here! We're here! -Help us! Over here! Help us!
