Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Hey, Miss Yara. Miss Yara, open the door! What's all this noise? I'm going deaf here! Why can't you show some good manners? Why must we endure this loud music every night? And you're not even here to listen to it. You just put it on and go for a walk! Why are you such an ill-mannered, annoying girl? Well, thank you, mister. That's so kind of you. Mr. Polite, Tidy and Sweet. Mr. Classy. What are you made of? Just tell me. Your disrespect is truly unbearable. Show some respect and concern for others. You're not the only tenant! Hey, hold on a second. How could you knock on a single woman's door at 3:00 a.m.? Excuse me? Did I wake you up? You just came back home! You're such a despicable, obnoxious man. You should watch your tongue! - How dare you come here and patronize me? - Maybe you need some patronizing! That's it! This is the last straw. Daddy, stop it! That is when Cupid hears about it and he flies over to Psyche. He kisses her forehead. Psyche wakes up and Cupid apologizes to her. He tells her that he was wrong and that he loves her so much. And that their love is not impossible. She proved to be a strong, brave girl when she went on impossible missions. And that's when they got married and lived happily ever after. Daddy, I don't like Miss Yara. She gets on your nerves. No, sweetie. We shouldn't say things like that. We don't hate anyone. We love everybody. Now it's time to sleep. You have school tomorrow. - Good night. - Good night. What kind of writing do we have? Cuneiform, verbal writing and… Selena? What is it? Daddy, who will teach me how to play the piano for the school concert? I'll find you someone. You want everybody to mock the history teacher because his own daughter doesn't know her history? Hieroglyphs first appeared shortly after cuneiform, around 6400 BC... Okay, okay, well done. When will you stop stealing my books? When my books are better than yours. Come on, sweetie. We're late. I came back home at 3:00 a.m. yesterday. I was exhausted and I came back to find that teacher knocking on my door. He's a real pain in the neck. I'm sure it's only because you're a woman. If you were a male DJ working at night, he wouldn't even dare talk to you. It's just because you're a woman, you should be insolent… Architect or doctor? Or maybe this time she's a bank manager, so she's up to his standards. Do you think he told her that he's looking for a prestigious girl? Or is he waiting for her to fall head over heels? All men are the same. You can never find an honest man. They're just a bunch of storytellers. What's the use anyway? Don't worry about it. You deserve better than that rascal. Cheers. I will never find a deserving man. Yara. Yara. Yara. Who are you? And what are you doing in my car? I'm Cupid. Who's that? Cupid! Dear lord, I have a terrible headache. Did you call the Red Cross? Yes, I did, but they're busy. I'll take you up with me for now and we'll see what happens. You'll either stay up there or be sent down. What's all this nonsense? Who are you? You're not just ignorant, you're also really stupid. You're dead, Yara. I can't move my legs. I can't move my hands! No, no, no! Please! I'm not dead. No, please! I don't want to die now. I still have so much to do. Besides, everybody loves me. Please! I beg you! What if I find someone who doesn't love you? That's impossible. Everybody loves me. Just check my followers on Instagram! Look how many likes I get when I post something on there. Please, no. Listen up, Yara. There's one person who cannot stand the sight of you. I'm giving you one month only. Make him fall in love with you and you will survive. Otherwise, you will die. Who? The man you just hit. Rabih. Rabih. Dear God, protect her. Dear God, save her. Dear God, spare her. Would you just cut it out? Lama, tell your friend's mother that we're choking here. Tell him to keep quiet! What is this, madam? What's this, Doc? She's giving me a stroke. She wants to kill everyone in the room. Doctor, my daughter is still unconscious. How could she regain consciousness with all this smoke, Doctor? Just tell her. Please, Doctor, all we have is each other in this world. May God protect her father and keep him safe. Just tell her. Yara, can you hear me? Yara? Yara? Welcome back. You had a small accident, but everything is fine. You'll soon get better and be able to go back home. It was a dream. It was just a dream. A nightmare. Thank God! You survived, my sweetheart. You see how good incense can help, honey? See, sweetie? Thank God we didn't choke to death. Yes, we could've choked on it, but thank God you woke up. - Thank God, Doctor. - Yes, thank God indeed. Sure you don't want me to come with you? No, no, I'm good. I'm just a bit tired. You should be, after what happened. But you're a strong girl. You'll be back to normal in a couple of days. Do you love me? Of course I love you. Why do you ask? Is that the concussion talking? You should be thankful that you didn't kill that man. Let's hope he doesn't press charges and have you thrown in jail. Good morning. Miss Layla, she's the one who ran down my dad. I'm sorry, sweetie. I didn't mean to. Besides, I just got out of the hospital as well. It's okay, Selena. Some people shouldn't be allowed to drive. I'm terribly sorry, sir. - Are you okay, sir? - Daddy, are you okay? I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I really don't know what to say. Don't say another word. TWENTY-NINE DAYS TO GO, YARA TIME IS RUNNING OUT What's wrong? You had me worried on the phone. It's nothing. I just miss you a lot and… I'm scared. I'm scared. What's wrong, Yara? Hold on a second. So you're telling me that you saw Cupid? And that he said you have one month to make Rabih fall in love with you or else you will die? Yara, I think you've lost your mind. I think that accident left you with a bad concussion. How could you drag me from work just to tell me this crazy story? Listen. Maybe, just maybe, you're in love with Rabih. What? Now you're the one who's lost her mind. Then tell me, why didn't you stop calling out his name last night? Rabih, Rabih… Are you serious? You see? That proves that I really did see Cupid! Cupid? This is the 21st century. Men and women are equal now, and you're here talking about Cupid? Call me when you decide to tell me the truth, okay? Besides, if you like that teacher, why waste time? Come on in. Just lower your voice! He heard you. Who was that with him? Who the hell cares about that? I'm in deep shit here. Did you even tell Mr. Rabih that you're happy about his speedy recovery? Hi. Have a speedy recovery! Hi, I'm Shady, single, 36 years old. I have a boutique. Its commercial registry number is 3675. My blood type is A+. Lama, 35 years old. I'm single, in marketing, and my blood type is also A+. You too? Would you like to have coffee on the balcony? - Why not? - Allow me. Thank God for your speedy recovery. Thank you. That's so sweet of you. This cake is very tasty. Would you like some? I'm sorry about the accident. I didn't mean to do it. Selena. Daddy, I'm going to my room to study. Okay, sweetie. Selena doesn't like me. But she's nice. So cute. Who plays the piano? Selena. About the accident... She has had an ear for music since she was five years old. I told her to be picky about her music, to avoid aural pollution. Some cake? Thank you. About the accident, are you gonna press charges? Since we're talking about music, what exactly does a DJ do? They just steal other peoples' songs and music and play them at parties. Then they release CDs under their names and pretend to be musicians? Did you know that our professions are very similar? Is that so? How? You steal information that has been researched and published by others. You write it down, present it at a lecture and sign your name on it. The difference between us is that when you hold a lecture, the students are bored to death. They feel so low that they would rather just die. Whereas people come to us to have a great time and feel good. Do you get the message? By the way, 90% of DJs are music majors and play an instrument, myself included. Eat some cake, sir. I have no doubt about your witty replies, but that doesn't mean you've convinced me or made me change my mind. Could you tell me why you hate me so much? Besides the fact you hit me with your car, broke my neck, and almost left me crippled? No reason at all. Some people are just unlovable. But I am lovable! Everybody loves me. I just don't get it. What difference would it make if I liked you or not? Would it kill you if I didn't like you? Just hold on a minute, Yara. You're a good, smart girl and you will find a solution. What to do? All right, what should you do? You should make that neighbor fall in love with you. Okay, okay… How would you describe that neighbor? Obnoxious… and rigid. Rigorous and unbearable. What kind of woman might he fall in love with? Could he love a woman who's mad, sweet, and beautiful? One who is stylish, who loves life, and is cute like me? I'm so cute. Not so cute. I have to do all these chores myself. Clean the house, Yara. Sweep it, mop it. Hey, sir! Cook and do the dishes. I'm sorry, it's cleaning day, so please excuse the mess. You know, cleanliness is next to godliness. Yes! Shit. Hey, what a nice coincidence. Coincidence? I saw you following me in here. I'm always in here. I've read half of these books, maybe more. I have some research to do. You're researching the sex lives of animals? Yes, I wanted to get a cat. But then I said, "Why not get a snake?" Mr. Rabih, we're late. Okay, okay, let's go. Good luck with your research. Thank you. Then I said, "Just a second." "Don't think you can boss me around just because I'm a woman." "Women are doing better than men in plenty of fields." "And don't you ever forget that behind every great man is a great woman." Well said. You reminded me of my mother. Your mom was an active feminist? No, but she was always behind my dad. She was always pressuring him. Look, Shady, I'm a very straightforward woman who wears her heart on her sleeve. I hate men who are intimidated by a strong woman. I'm not one of them. I love a strong woman. I'd really love her. But may I ask how strong? Extremely. By the way, I really like you. You're funny and kind. And now I'm blushing. Is my face red? I'm having a really great time. I'm feeling so good and happy. I'm happy too. I feel like there's an irresistible spark between us. God bless you. Good evening, sir. I'm sorry for troubling you at this late hour, but I'm really upset and I haven't had a good night's sleep for a couple of days. I have something extremely important to tell you. It's urgent, super urgent. You need urgent intensive care. Good evening, sir. First, I wanted to see how you're doing. I hope you're well. Second, I have something important to tell you. Hi, Rabih! How are you doing, man? I just felt like calling you Rabih, just to be casual. We're just neighbors hanging out. May you choke to death. Hi. I really tried. You know that I have rather classical tastes. I've already tried but nobody has time for me. Hello there. Yes, yes. Yes, but the concert is in three weeks. Selena needs a teacher. I don't know. Just find me one. Ladies first. So she arrived and I was wearing my black leather jacket. Just like Michael Jackson, with the red and black stripes. It's an irresistible jacket. You should have seen Lama's face when she saw me. She was astonished, amazed. - She sighed and... - Passed out upon seeing you. She couldn't take it, bro. She really loved the jacket. She yelled and then cried. It was unbelievable. Daddy, is there any news on the piano teacher? He cannot do it. - Miss Layla is the only choice left. - No. Okay, I'll try to find someone else. Sweetie, read that poem again. It's a very nice one. I knew it when I was in school. "The cicada was so happy to sing." Good evening, Mr. Rabih. I'm terribly sorry for coming here so late at night. It's so late! It's already 6:45. I usually go to bed at 7:30. As you know, early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise. I wanted to tell you that I changed jobs, I've switched to teaching. As you must know, teaching is a "scared" calling, it's a sacred calling. Here is my business card. I'm a music teacher now. I like to look after the future generation. We should educate the future generation and take good care of them. If you're interested, feel free to give me a call. Excuse me. Mr. Rabih, please don't bother me by knocking on my door. I have a yoga session before bed. As you must know, yoga transcends our soul. Have a good night. And good night to your sweet girl. May God bless her. May God protect you both and allow you to shield her with your care. You can't do it? Not even for 30 minutes a day? I tried but it didn't work. All right, thank you. Thank you very much. You called me over here because you had something very important to discuss with me. But you've been silent for half an hour. Life with your mother has become unbearable. I lost my youth and my life thanks to your ungrateful father. This life is a living hell, sweetie. It's a living hell. Whatever I do, it's never good enough. There's no point going on like this. Tell her I want a divorce! How silly. I've wanted a divorce for ages. You want a divorce? What the hell are you doing here? I told you I wanted to see my parents. - Yara, are you okay? - What's wrong, sweetie? What is it? Are you hallucinating? Do you have a fever? - Are you talking to me? - I have no idea. What do you want? "Miss Yara, I didn't want to bother you." "You might be doing yoga and letting your soul transcend." "We need music lessons. One hour per day for three weeks." "If it's okay with you, please call me. Rabih." No, my sweet cutie pie. Let's go over this again. No, what's wrong with you today? You have no focus. To be honest, Miss Yara, I am focusing on you, and that's the problem. What's the problem? I'm sorry. My bad. What do you mean? What's the problem? I'm not used to seeing you in that kind of outfit. The other outfits belong in the past. I've got a new style now. I'm leading a new life now. I'm a teacher now and this is a teacher's outfit. Very well, but Selena is right about your hair. His name is Joe. But why is that heart broken? Does he love you? What if he loves you? I don't know. But he probably doesn't. Anyway, he's moving overseas once school is over. I might not see him again, and he definitely doesn't love me. All right, since we're out of time and school will be over soon, we should find out whether he loves you or not. - How? - Just ask him. Selena. - How are you? - I'm fine. I love you. Thank you. Could we be girlfriend and boyfriend? - No, we're still too young. - Okay, I get it. - Really? - Yes. And he even asked me if we can be boyfriend and girlfriend. I said, "No, we're still too young for that." My sweetie. Wow, I love your house. What's this? That's my DJ controller. I make my music on that. Really? How? Sorry for barging in. I was looking for Selena. Hi, sir. Oh, hello, sir. I was just teaching Selena how I play my music at the nightclub. Miss Yara's work is very interesting, Dad. Listen to this. That's very nice, sweetie. Very nice. Let's go. You have homework to do. Mr. Rabih, I have a nightclub gig. I'm talking about my night job. Lama and Shady will be there. Didn't Shady tell you about it? It's tomorrow. I mean today. Today, I'm telling you about tomorrow. Because tomorrow I'll be working at night. Today, I'm telling you about tomorrow. - Thank you but… - It's not your thing? Actually, it is. I love it, from time to time. But I have a lecture tomorrow. Oh, okay. Let's go, Selena. Maybe some other time. Thank you for the invitation. Excuse me. Some other time? When will that be? I'm running out of time. What do you mean you're not coming? What? Yara, people are really down in the dumps. They're exhausted and depressed. Can't you just… Hello? Yara? Yara? Are you eating? Hello there. How are you? Long time no see. Finish your plates and then follow me. Who hasn't seen a Viking movie? Or, more recently, the series Vikings? If you haven't seen any, you can leave right now. But do you think that an army that has led all of these invasions would wear horns on their head and risk looking like sitting ducks to their enemies? Indeed they didn't. The Vikings didn't wear horned helmets. Christopher Columbus didn't discover that the Earth is round. Aristotle and Pythagoras had talked about it long before he did. Edison didn't invent the light bulb. His team developed it based on previous studies. Tesla created alternating current motors and we've just discovered that Edison had nothing to do with it. But Tesla did used to work for him. Who gets to write history? The victors or the losers? How can we believe the history books? Who should we believe? Google? Wikipedia? Other websites? Or should we believe the history teacher who's standing there in front of us and seems totally clueless? Thank you very much. Miss Yara. - What are you doing here? - I was just dropping by that thing… I came to see you teach. To be honest, for a history teacher, you're not boring at all. - Bye for now. - Miss Yara? Would you like to go out for dinner sometime? He asked me out to dinner! He asked me out! What should I wear? All right then, bye! So? What do you think? You look very nice. - Does this look better? - Both are fine. Do I have a potbelly? No, not at all. - Let's just go. - What's wrong? Let's just go somewhere else. Please. - Yara. - Why? What's wrong? I was sure it was you. And I made no mistake. I can always spot you, even among 100 other girls. - You look stunning. - Hi, I'm Rabih. - Hello. - Mr. Rabih is a history teacher. And he's my neighbor. He lives in the flat next to mine. You changed your address? Why didn't you tell me? I haven't changed my phone number, so call me. I'd known him for three years. Then I heard him talking about me to his parents. He said I didn't meet his standards. - So what did you do? - Nothing at all. I didn't tell him that I had heard him. I thought he wouldn't share his parents' archaic mentality. Besides, he loved me deeply. A week later, he dumped me and told me that he didn't love me. This is the fourth time I've run into him. He always acts normal, as if we're best friends. Is there something wrong with me? Am I unlovable? - Do you love him? - No. - What's wrong? What happened? - It's okay. No harm done. I'm so sorry. My bad. I'm sorry. Won't you ever leave me alone? Did you have to appear right then? You just had to ruin that moment! I missed you. I wanted to see you. You missed me? He was about to confess his feelings to me, but you just had to… I'm just practicing. I'm acting. I have a casting session. I disappear and then reappear! I am not crazy! You know, I attended one of your lectures, so you should do the same and come to watch me at work. What's that? One for you, one for me? Thanks for dinner. Thank you for your concern, and for listening to my boring stories. I hope I've changed your mind about me. Yara? Excuse me. - Yara, I want a word with you. - What brought you here? I said I wanted a word. I need to see you. - I don't want to talk to you. - Come here for a second. What is this? Let go of me. I said let go! - She said no. - Please, butt out. Who is that? What the hell are you doing with someone like him? It's none of your business. I have nothing to say to you. Come to my car. - Let go of me! - Nabil. Yes, but he still didn't say it. You… Here you go. And again. GREATEST ARABIC LEGENDS - Are you serious? - Yes, it looks that way. But he hasn't said it yet. What's to be said? He hit that man. It's not for certain yet. He hasn't said the words yet. You women are unbelievable. You're amazing, wonderful! I love my irresistible woman. Just a second. Now, tell me, what is this? - What? - Your business plan. Lama, please. I said forget about it. Why would you waste your time in vain? In vain? Babe, your designs should be world renowned. Don't play down in the dumps with me now. "No, I can't do it." You could be famous. But you just need one thing. - And what is that? - A woman behind you. To keep pushing you until you make it. - I was about to call you. - Really? I'm sorry. I should have told you sooner. We have to cancel today's lesson. I have some last-minute work to do and I couldn't find anyone to stay with Selena. So I'm taking her with me. Really? But we're almost out of time. I meant Selena's school concert. It would be a shame to skip today's lesson. I could stay with her if you like, unless you don't trust me. I told you Miss Yara would stay with me. - Was it good? - Perfect. It's his birthday today and I don't know what to get him. - Is it Joe's birthday? - No, Dad's. Okay. And now what? Now we'll add… four cups of flour. - What's this? Look here. - Where? No! That's enough, sweetie. No, don't! Switch it off. Miss Yara? Selena? Miss Yara? Go on! Blow out the candles, Daddy. - Happy birthday, Daddy. - Thank you, sweetie. Is it good? It's great. But it would have been much better with some sugar in it. We didn't add sugar? - Dad? - It's a living hell. Life with your mother is a living hell. I couldn't stay there another minute. Hello, I'm Salim, Yara's father. - Who are you? - I'm Rabih. - And who's that? - Mr. Rabih lives next door. - And this is his daughter, Selena. - Nice to meet you. The pleasure is all mine. We'd better go then. No. Please stay. I won't bother you, sweetie. I'll just sleep on the sofa until I find a new house, okay? Besides, I put my coffee pot on the stove. Do you know what he does? What is this about? The pot? - Mom! - Just let me continue. He'd remove my coffee pot and replace it with his. He'd just put his own pot there. I was fuming. I wanted to tell him, "Shame on you!" But I thought I'd better keep quiet. I don't wanna stoop to his level or have anything to do with him. But shame on him. I wanted to tell him how rude he is. All right, Mom, all right. Okay. I heard that! I'm rude? And impolite and ill-mannered. All right, just tell him. As if I haven't looked after him for 30 years! What a waste of time and energy! All right then, Mom, just tell him. Why are you telling me all this? No, I won't tell him anything. I swore never to speak to him again. Let's stop talking about him. Tell me what you're up to. Yara, this is unacceptable. Hello, I'm Salim, Yara's father. - Yara, who's there with you? - I'm Yara's boss. Yara's ruining my business. Is that your father? What is he doing there? She's not coming to work. You're not even answering my calls. Mom, hold on a second. I'm sorry, boss. I couldn't go. I'm in the middle of a special situation. You and your father are plotting against me? - Mom, just calm down. - What is she saying? Tell me right now what's going on here! Why did he come to you? Mom, this is not a good time. Yara, whatever this is, you cannot just quit your job. - People are desperate and tired. - What are you doing here? She keeps following me wherever I go. I was here first. She keeps following me, as if she were my shadow. I wasn't following you. I came here to see my daughter. You're no big shot! You're not the center of the universe. Yara, just tell your mother to leave. Could you just let me explain? Hold on a minute! You did all this? "Be classical." "Listen to the music he likes." "Read books"? "Take care of his daughter"? - Let me explain. - What is this? Is this a game? Is it part of some bet? Did you place a bet with someone? You have one month to make me fall in love with you? - Just let me explain. - No, I don't want your explanation. I don't want to hear it. I took you for a mature, realistic person. I thought I had misjudged you, because I didn't know you. But no, it turns out I've been right about you from day one. I didn't misjudge you at all. Rabih, please, I beg you. Let me tell you what happened. Just listen to me. You know something, Miss Yara? Everything in life happens for a reason. Everything, big or small, there's a reason for it. But that doesn't change the outcome. You cannot play with people or their feelings only to tell them some story afterwards. And you think they'd just believe you and forgive you? People are not toys! You cannot just place bets on them. I forgive you. And don't think that I hold the slightest grudge against you. I don't. At all. I don't hate you. Mostly because… I have no feelings towards you whatsoever. Let's go, Selena. Rabih. - Rabih. - Hi, Miss Layla. Happy birthday, Mr. Rabih. Thank you. Come on in. I was expecting you. No! Are you serious? Did you have a bet with someone? No, please don't cry. Don't cry. You should just talk about it. He wouldn't even talk to me. When we meet in the hallway or on the street… he just looks right past me, as if I were invisible. How could you even do that? Why did you leave it there on the table? Don't cry! I'll ask Shady to talk to him. But I'm still waiting for you to tell your best friend what's going on. Who did you make this bet with? Don't make a fuss, bro. It's nothing! Just be cool about it. Even if she made a mistake, there's no need to be so cruel. Just cut it out, Shady. I don't want to talk about her. I don't want to know anything about her. Sweetie, if you're studying French, I can help you with that. Yara, are you still angry? It's not that big of a deal! The deal was to make him fall for you, not the other way round. Nor was it to make a mess of yourself. That's two birds with one stone. Look at this fool! She doesn't know that lawyer's fees will set her back $10,000. And twice that for the house. And as she says, she just wants to start over. Poor woman! Did she just wake up? She's in her sixties. Who would hook up with her in her sixties? Yara has me worried. She's not returning my calls. And she's never home. Mr. Salim told me she doesn't want to see anyone. She spends all her time outside. Rabih is just being too stubborn. Whenever I try to discuss it with him, he changes the subject or leaves the room. I don't really get it. Why are people always so terrified? Why can't they just be like us? Down to earth and at ease. Just like the two of us. Sweetie, not everybody is like us. Having that… "up-decency." I mean astigmatism. - Fantasy? - Do you mean "telepathy"? One hundred per cent. Selena's clearly had enough practice for the school concert. But I'd rather not use the mix that she chose. It's not suitable for the concert or for the school's overall image. Do you get my point, sir? Yes, of course I do, Miss Layla. Could you convince her to drop it? It would be for the best. - Okay, I'll have a word with her. - Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. Rabih, Mr. Rabih. We're hanging out at Miss Maha's place tomorrow. It'll just be a couple of teachers and friends. Would you like to come? - We could play Monopoly, Scrabble… - Sure. I'd be honored. Really? Okay, would you like me to give you the address or should I pick you up at 8:00 p.m.? - Okay. See you at 8:00. - Okay, perfect. Bye. Bro, what's going on? Nothing. Come on in. What are you saying, Yara? No! You can't just quit out of the blue. Please, boss, try to understand. It's out of my hands. I wish it wasn't, but in any case, you will need to find another DJ. No, Yara, you can't just quit. This is nonsense. People are so down in the dumps. They want some good vibes. They want to dance and have a good time. You're the best DJ I've ever had. You know how to give them a good time. Without you, this place is dead. You get what I'm saying? Dead. No, boss. I might die, okay? It's this club that matters! I know that people are feeling down and they're bored. And they will keep coming here, to dance, to have fun and feel better. With or without me. What's wrong? I don't feel like going home. Would you like to go out somewhere? Just anywhere? I just told you that I promised to meet Shady here. Come on. We can all go together. - Hi, sweetheart. - Good evening. Yara's coming with us. Let's go. You know what? I just remembered Dad's all alone in the house. I'll go and spend some time with him. You two go and have fun. - Take good care of her. - Sure thing. Yara, I went out with my friends. Don't forget, we have a meeting with the lawyer tomorrow at 4:00 p.m. The month's almost over, isn't it? It's over. That was quick. All right, come with me then. Before I go, could I just have some time to say goodbye to my parents? Just talk to Lama. Yes, Lama, I'll be right down. Selena. Are you still on bad terms with Dad? Why? Why won't either of you tell me what happened? I'm a big girl now. I can understand these things. My sweetie, I know that you're a big girl now. But there are things that not even grown-ups can understand. Will you come to the school concert today? It starts at 6:00 p.m. I'll do my best. I just have this thing I need to do first with my mom and dad. And if I can make it, I will certainly be there. Do you love my dad? Yes. What about him? Does he love you? I don't know. Maybe not. I don't know. There's only one way to find out. And that is? Just ask him. Selena, what are you doing out there? Nothing. Come inside. You have to study. I know you don't want to see me. I know that you can't even stand the sight of me. But there's something very important that I need to get off my chest. So please hear me out. I lied to you. I know. And I know that I was very selfish. I used you. But there's a very important reason why I did all that. You can call it a game, or even call it a bet. I had to make you love me. I had to prove to myself that I could make you fall in love with me. That was my main goal. But all that is irrelevant now. Now I know what matters and what doesn't. There's only one truth that you should know… and it's that I love you. I really love you. It doesn't matter now if you changed your mind about me. It won't change a thing anyway. Because time is up. Selena, go and study. Thank you, Lama. Thank you for being a real friend. And sorry that I didn't appreciate you before. We've already been through all that. Now, get out. I love you. I love you too. - You want me to wait for you? - No. Are you seeing Shady today? You know, I'm so happy. I finally found an honest, straightforward man. He is plain and true. Someone just like me. And I'm happy that you're happy. All right, people, the papers are ready and I think we all agree on the terms. - We can sign them now. - All right, there you go. Let him sign them first. You see how she lays it all on me? I won't sign these until she does. Listen, lawyer, I don't want to cause a fuss. He's playing dirty. He wants me to sign them and then he'll refuse to sign. These are the games I told you about. - Do you believe me now? - What did he tell you, counselor? Tell me. Everything he said is a lie. He likes to make up lies about me in order to tarnish my image. Well done, counselor. You're so lucky to have a client like her. I lived with her for 30 years! She just likes to play innocent when she is really a wolf in sheep's clothing. She's a snake hidden in the grass. A viper with a wicked tongue. I have a wicked tongue? Salim, son of Hanneh and Tansa the goat herder? I'm a snake, you poor villager? But it's my fault for marrying a simpleton like you. You'd better stand up when you talk to me! I'm standing. What did you want to say? Did you forget how you used to follow me around? Just so I could catch a glimpse of you? So, excuse me, Mrs. Wafa', for looking over my cow to gaze at you. Counselor, they were cows with big, beautiful eyes. What a damned man I was to stop looking into those cows' eyes, only to look at… - To look at what? Just say it. - To look at… To look into her eyes. And when I saw her eyes, she enchanted me. That's what happened. The good old days. Lost forever. Remember when I'd run away from my parents' house to see you? Yes, I remember. We went down to Zaidan's cellar and when I tried to steal a kiss, you slapped my face so hard that it still hurts me today. You deserved it. It's good that I slapped you on the face. Remember Hanna the deaf man? He almost caught us. Imagine if he had seen you kissing me. What a scandal! I remember. You had a real sixth sense. Counselor, she has a great sixth sense. She saved me from plenty of fights and trouble. - She has a really strange sixth sense. - And you too, Salim. In bad times, you're a really brave man, like no other. Woe the man who doesn't have a woman like that to support him! I'm blushing, Salim! You can blush! Your rosy cheeks are what I live and die for. You see what a sweet flirter he is? Wafa', I will not sign these. Wafa', I'm overwhelmed by my feelings, heart, body, and soul! Wafa', I love you! He loves me, he loves me! Salim, I swore I'd never say it again. But I have to say it. I was scared at first, but I'm not anymore. Salim. I love you and I miss you. I miss you like hell! - Wafa'? - Yes? - Let's go home right now. - Let's go. - Let's go. - Let's go. Could you take a shortcut, please? It's gridlocked up ahead. A shortcut, miss? Just take a look around you. Yara, don't sweat it. There's no need. Just shut your mouth! Are you talking to me, insolent girl? No, I was talking to… Don't say another word! Shut it! Get out of here. Just get out! Get out! Excuse me, could you give me a lift? I have to be somewhere, it's urgent! - It's really urgent. I cannot wait! - Calm down. - Put the helmet on. - Thank you! - Faster, please! - Hold on a sec! There's traffic up ahead. Hold on and look ahead. You get the hell out of here! Move it! Don't you get it? Get out of here! Get lost! Go! Just get lost. Come on, you! Move it! Get off! Just leave me alone! - Move it! - Get off! - Okay, I'm going. - Give me that helmet. - Take it off. Now, beat it! - Go away! - You stupid, mad woman. - Cut it out! Stop following me! - We have to go. Time's up. - We still have time. There's something important I must do before I go. Yara, stop! You can't run away from me! I said, there's something important I must do first. Don't you get it? And our final performance is by one of our talented pupils. She will be playing us a piece on the piano. Let's hear it for our student, Selena Yussef! We can go now. Where? Where are you going? You wanted to tell me a story. I'd like to hear it. You won't believe me, even if I told you. You'll just think I'm crazy. And you're not? You don't have to tell me if you don't want to. But I have a story I want to tell you, and you have to hear me out. The story goes… I love you. I love you so much. LEBANESE DESIGNER SHADY SAAD BEHIND EVERY GREAT MAN IS A GREAT WOMAN - I love you. - I love you too. You are irresistible. It's Rabih. Let it ring. It's Yara. Let it ring. Excuse me for a second. Hello? Yes. Speaking. Oh, hello. You're welcome. Great. Yes, sure, tomorrow at ten. Okay, it's a deal. Bye. Fashion Trip. It's a design company. They called me and said they liked my work and want to see me. I told you. Rabih! Rabih. I love you. There's a woman who can't stand the sight of you. You have just one month. If you win her love, you will survive. If you fail to do that, you will die. Who is she?
