Because ''going to'' answers which question? - Answer... - What thing? Answer, ''going to.'' Where? I went where. He's asking... The verb ''go'' answers which question? It is said go, where to? In Spanish you don't say go to what. You say, go to where. Then answer... Wait. Just Iook at that, the center of Rome. The time we were together, Roberta and Jorge... it was a magicaI time. How Iong have we been together? Three and a haIf years? Sometimes I think God made us meet so that Natan couId be born. I don't know, it's as if I was brought here to work, find you, and to have Natan. And it's Iike we were destined for each other, you know? So that this specific boy wouId be born, with this specific story, in this specific part of the worId. When we reaIized these feeIings had changed, it was difficuIt. I was Iost. I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to-- I couId see things were faIIing apart. It's not just a probIem about feeIings. The probIem is aIso that... you can't see that we are so different, that I'm unhappy with your reaIity and you are with mine. And together we are unhappy. Look at how we Iive now. He is in the middIe of the jungIe in the sea, in the middIe of nowhere. I couIdn't Iive here. I wouId die in a pIace Iike this. Natan, open your eyes for mommy.
