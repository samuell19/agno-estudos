ONE SINGS, THE OTHER DOESN'T You waiting for me? Sometimes people give up. Just put in a bell. I've never seen pictures like these. Are they yours? Yes. Such sad women! - Sad? No. They're all unwed moms, widows, women beaten or abandoned. No, they're neighbors willing to pose. I'm willing to wait. - For what? For them to tire of posing. Then they let themselves go, and they're just there. They're beautiful pictures, but they bother me too. This one with the kids - I used to know her. We were neighbors five years ago on rue du Maine. But she got into some trouble and disappeared. I always wanted to find her again, but my parents bad-mouthed her. She was nice... but not sad like that. Maybe it's my fault. You weren't very flattering to poor Suzanne! I wonder where she is now. - She lives with me. The kids are ours. Damn! I really put my foot in it! I'm sorry. - You still live on rue du Maine? - Yes. And you? 15 rue Fermat. 15 rue Fermat? I'll go see her. Tell her Pauline from the third floor. Good-bye. Men, don't come in so abruptly. Concentrate. That goes for everyone. Try harder. If only it meant a school credit. I just wish it meant money. Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. - Hi, sweetheart. You'll ruin your appetite. An apple a day... - How did choir go? - Hallelujah! - School? - Same old stuff. Philosophy's a drag. So is getting a diploma. Drop out and be a salesgirl on your feet all day. You know I want to be a singer. Sure, but finish school first. With no education, it's marriage or prostitution. - Not much difference. - She's crazy! Go wash up. It's time to eat. Remember Suzanne, the shoemaker's niece? Yes, she got into some sort of trouble. - I saw her. - You did? Her picture. She looks 30! I'm not surprised. She started at it too young. You see... Jéréme doesn't get it. He's in his lab... making print after print all day till he's satisfied. And the women he likes to shoot are usually broke. No one buys his pictures... so he gives them away. He earns very little. Why don't you work? With these two? And do what? I have no skills. And the neighborhood daycare is full. They're sweet. Mathieu is. But Marie's withdrawn. Probably my fault. I lost the - I often feel like crying. You have to do something. Talk to Jéréme. Talk to Jéréme? It's hard. He's tired. He smiles in that way of his, and I just stop talking. I don't even dare tell him I'm pregnant again. You're pregnant? Can't your folks help? Where are they? In Soisson. They refuse to see me. - Your aunt? - Same. What a mess. How far along are you? About two months. Don't cry. You have to get an abortion. How? It's not that simple! We'll find a way. I can't tell Jéréme. They're his kids too! Want me to talk to him? You? How old are you? - Just over 17. I feel like I'm 100. How old are you really? Twenty-two. - Go on. - I will. Mrs. Carlier? In class you said free will is not just a philosophical or moral concept, but a reality demonstrated in concrete situations, even political ones. So free will is philosophy in action. Can you help me? I have a friend who's pregnant... but can't keep it. - Is it you? No. She has two kids. But I'm not a doctor. Maybe you know a name or an address...? No, I'm really sorry. Good-bye. It didn't work. You thought she'd point you to an abortionist? Some girls in choir might know. Tell me... would you know a good “address”? - You're pregnant? - A friend is. It's not simple. There's a woman, the concierge at 24 rue Saint-Séverin. I've heard that address often. - You know her? - No. - She does it all? - Right! She inserts a probe. The rest is up to you. - I said it's not for me. Fine! She charges 20,000 francs. Or there's Switzerland. - I know. But you have to take a test and give 'em a hard-luck story. If they agree, it's cheap. If not, a doc who'll do it is expensive, plus the trip. See you. - Thanks. He was stupid. He bought his car on credit. I got a 13 in English, but no math grade yet. You're late as usual. Just eat without me. A family has rules and hours... or it's just chaos. Cheese, please. Clean off the table a bit. You and your cleanliness. Be sweet and put the coffee on. I'll do it. I'm “sweet”... if I follow your “rules and hours.” Long live the family! All we ask is some respect for those who gave you birth. I didn't ask to be born. You didn't even know how to prevent it! You asked for that! Studying philosophy gives you no right to insult us. Go on! You won't be boss over me much longer. - Stop it. - She's full of hot air! The parent system is no good. Dad grumbles while Mom's sweet and silent. Or else Dad passes the peace pipe while Morn hollers. Parents are no fun. - Being an orphan is? - I didn't say that. Wait till you have your own kids. I have other plans. By the way, the choir has organized a weekend trip to sing in an abbey near Avignon. It's 20,000 francs. Can I go? I got this. But a Swiss abortion costs more. You're really kind. Can Jéréme get some more? From whom? His wife? She hates him. Understandably. Yes, of course. Why don't they divorce? She refuses just to get at him, so he can't legally be father to our kids. Hi, gang- How you doing? Listen, that woman on rue Saint-Séverin... will 20,000 be enough? - That's too risky. Tell Jéréme to find the money. I'll watch the kids. - You will? - School's out from the 22nd to 24th. Then it's Switzerland. You have to look sad and cry for the medical board. There are four of them, like judges. Looking sad won't be hard. But Jérome's in a bad way. I could never have left the kids with him. He can't do a thing for them except love them. Listen... he asked me if you'd pose for him. He couldn't ask you in person because you knew about my situation before he did. So what? We're friends. So you will? Yes... but I've never posed. It's not working. They're no good. What? I've been here two hours, and you've taken tons. You're too guarded. Yes, you are. I just don't have that overwhelmed look you like. I won't be a victim, even for a picture. You're being nasty. You just refuse to be real. What I'm after is Woman... in her naked truth. You want me to pose nude? Even that may not help. - Where? - Over there. It's that sense of surrender, the secret of life you women have within you. It's a weighty secret. That'll never work. It's my fault. I apologize. I can't do it. I don't know what to think. It's as if I weren't a real girl. No, it's not that. You just baffle me. I don't understand. You'll never grow up, sweetie. You have aspirin? I'm not going on a desert trek. Want me to come along? I'm so unhappy that you - - I'll be okay. Everyone tells me they do a good job. I'd never let you go anywhere else. No matter the cost. Go inside. Hello. I'm looking for postcards of Avignon abbeys. I'll see. Hello, crab apple. How are you? Then go get your bear. Good morning. You've been awake a while. Sit down there. We'll all sleep together. You're very sweet. - You're up? - André, you promised! - Let him blow his top. - That won't help. You and your lies. We traveled 1,000 miles to hear you sing at Avignon. You'll pay for this. Why would you lie like that? - To get money. - You could have talked to us. For an abortion. You'd never understand. What? Suzanne needed an abortion and had no money. This is disgraceful! I've had enough! - Me too. I'm moving out. Calm down, honey. No, I don't want to. - You're a minor. - I'll send word. Your finals are in three months. You gonna study in the street? Get your diploma like normal people. No more school for me. I'd rather sing in the streets than be “normal.” No one's going to say you left home broke. Here's 40,000. Your whole class can have abortions. You obviously don't know the rates, but thanks. You disgust me! How could this happen? What did we ever do to her? - Sure he won't mind? - We'll manage. Gabriel will be delighted. Two girls at the same time! That's his dream! - It's not mine. He'll be disappointed. It's all just talk. Nice place. Gabriel did it. I'll make paella. Our maid taught me how. And I have a little money for food. And we'll earn some. I went by the studio. We're hired! - When? - We record Thursday. You think I should finish school or drop out? School's no use in music. Drop out! They're getting into everything! They're not here often. Are you all right? You're not too tired? No, not very. I just really wanted to see you. I feel lost. Fight. You have to fight. - If you can. - You can. You have strength enough for the kids, for me, even for the other one - I mean, if only I provided for us properly. I work but I make no money. Pauline left home. Another unsold photo. It was no good anyway. She was too stubborn, or I was too weak. She's nice and all... but I can't make concessions. No more kindness, no smiles. Her smile has helped me a lot. But it's you I want to be with. Come for a walk with us? No, the sadness in people's eyes is too much. Don't say that. I'm tired too. I feel so alone. Don't you trust in me? I feel like a poor and lonely mute girl. I've cried too much. I'll try again. I found a job, knitting at home for a children's shop. You're brave. I have to take them out. And I have to develop a customer's lousy shots by 6:00. See you later. - You have to forgive me. - For what? Whose fault is it? I don't understand any of it. That's enough. Are we ready? Let's go. Stop clinging to me like chewing gum, baby Rock and roll is for a man to play So step aside, baby And let me sing with my buddies And clap to the beat No, the backup's all wrong. I see we have new voices. Hello, ladies. Gabriel, say hello in your deep voice. Very funny. Let's take it from the top. Marie! I just got paid for my first doo-wop session. I made some money. - Great! - We'll celebrate. My treat. Cookies, ice cream, or candy? No, I don't want any. I'm surprised! Listen, I went past the shop. It was closed. I'd better go by. We'll go in the back way. It's locked. We need the key. Don't worry. Maybe he's asleep. Could you try the back window? The window's closed. Break it. - Really? - Yeah, go ahead. What's going on? I don't have a key. Me neither. He's in there. Well? He hanged himself. Did you say he hanged himself? We have to call the police. Quick! That's him. Tell them to get him down. This story's about a cat named Purtykat... and a blue teddy bear. Those two pals met on the street... and decided to go on the merry-go-round. He was miserable to the very end. He wanted to be cremated. He didn't even get that. It makes me sick. What'll I do? Stop it. Let's go. You poor thing. He was such a nice man. Thanks for coming. What will you do now? Go back to my parents' farm. Then we'll see. The tragedy that had made the girls close friends now abruptly separated them. Suzanne sold her belongings and, with her children, fled Paris and Jéréme's legal widow, who was trying to saddle her with all the bills from the studio. She arrived at her parents' home, who gave a cold welcome to their “lost child,” an unwed mother. With nowhere else to go, she stayed. Then she had time for her tears. Shocked by Jéréme's death, Pauline cried too... seeing in Suzanne's tragedy the same anguish Pauline saw on faces all around her. She sang. She began to change. Her parents finally gave her money to rent a room. She put up a map, hoping to find the village Suzanne had mentioned. Time passed. Ten years later... Suzanne and Pauline were both following the trial of a girl of 16 who'd had an abortion. Many of those fighting the abortion laws gathered outside the Bobigny courthouse where the closed trial was held in October of 1972. The girl was acquitted beginning a series of reforms. LET US HAVE KIDS WHEN WE WANT TO Free Marie-Claire! We've all had abortions. Put us on trial! I'm with Family Planning. It's a closed trial, ma'am. A closed trial! You can't go inside, ma'am. It's Giséle Halimi, Marie-Claire's lawyer. You have no right to keep them out. The verdict is public by law. Let them pass. Neither Pop nor pope Nor doc nor judge Will lay down the law for me Biology isn't fate Pop's laws are out of date My body is mine And I know When I want to have My young To have any young In this old world To be round or flat The choice is mine My body is mine Be you a whoring Mary or a virgin Mary Weeping mother or easy lay Damned or not No matter what they say Be you praised Or tossed in the hay Hail, sisters! Hail, Marie! What are you doing here, Suzanne? Marie, how you've grown! In my songs I talk about you as a baby. That was 10 years ago. She's 13 now. And already on the streets! I brought her to our Family Planning congress. Mathieu is on a school trip. How old is he now? Eleven... and very handsome. He's okay. - You look the same. - You look better than ever. Come meet Darius. Darius, this is Suzanne. I told you about her. I remember. Hello. - He's Iranian. - This is Marie. Whenever anything special happened, it was always you I wanted to see. Me too. I even spoke to you in my mind. Let's not split up again. But I live down south. And you? Paris... for the past six months. And three months with me. So it's good-bye already. Our train leaves tonight. Mathieu is due back. We can't leave him alone. We haven't even had time to talk. I must get back to our Family Planning meeting. Sitting in a park once, Apple told me about you. It felt so real and detailed that I thought you'd pop out from behind a tree. But you've told me nothing so far. How did you meet? Where? I was getting an abortion. We met in Amsterdam. And then again in Paris. Are you married, or single, or what? Unmarried. The kids and I get along fine. I had an affair, but it didn't work out. I know what you mean. What else are you up to? So much to ask, so much to tell. I thought I'd never find you, and now that I have - The crowd is pushing you aside. - Let's write, okay? - Yes, long letters. Let's meet soon. I'll write you at Family Planning. Suzanne thought of Pauline - now “Apple” - and wanted to tell her about her life because of what they'd been through years earlier. Seeing you moved me so deeply, I couldn't talk. The past 10 years all came back to me, wintry years of silence and spite. But how can I describe frozen time? The kids didn't sense a thing. They loved the country and the animals. Marie grew up cheerful and Mathieu strong. That was good. I tried not to feel or see a thing. I just wanted to hang on, to survive... me and my kids. Soup's on. Call your little bastards. Time to eat, darlings. Look how nicely Marie eats. Apple thought about Suzanne too. I got overexcited at the demonstration. I talked too much. So I know nothing of what's going on with you. I wish you were with me in this lousy truck with these girls I met in '68. They were singing in the street. They're great. We have plans. We 're driving to a gala in a northern suburb. A “gala”! You should see it. Not a nanny Nor a granny Nor a fanny I'm Woman I'm me Not fast and loose Nor a house mouse Nor a namby-pamby I'm Woman I'm me I'm “Apple” That's it. We earned our bread. Now the long drive home to my honey's bed. - Not sleepy? - Not really. - Wasn't it good? - Yes, very. But you're not sleepy. I am. I'm thinking about Suzanne. Sleep... and you'll dream about her. We have ten years to catch up on. Will you tell her all about us too? It's not that. With her it's like love, but without the headaches. Of course. You never see each other. Sure, we've been out of touch, but we don't have to start all over from scratch. It's so easy between us. Should I be jealous? Or can I sleep? Go to sleep. How can I tell about 10 years in a few words? I told you, “Darius... meeting... Amsterdam... abortion. " But it's not enough. I want to really tell you how we met in Amsterdam. lt'd be nice to see something besides this dining hall. You know Amsterdam? - A bit. Is there a boat ride on the canals? Yes, I've taken it. - Is it expensive? - No, three florins. That's about five francs. We could afford that. What do you say? If anyone wants to take a boat ride on the canals... tell me and we'll get a group rate. They say it's nice. - Have they done you yet? - I'm scheduled for 2:30. You scared? Not really. I'm just mad I got in this fix. In this fix? I got indigestion a half hour after taking the pill. And it came up with the feast. I wish it had been a feast... That was the day I officially fell in love with Darius. But what really mattered was the tenderness I felt for the women there with me... like me. I can still see their eyes. I thought of Jéréme's photos and of you all alone in those difficult times. Sure, I put up a good front, but I was so relieved to be with a group. That's when I wrote my first song. I decided to sing in my own way about my family of women there, all in the same dorm, the same fix, the same boat. Gliding under the bridges of Amsterdam On a Dutch sightseeing boat Go the knocked-up, fucked-up ladies The damsels and mam'selles afloat The awkward and foolish madams Sadly abused by their Adams We're taking, if you please A cruise for abortion-ees The boat's not romantic After the clinic Amsterdam-on-the-sea I'll remember Tulips and bikes, you see Watching the bikes go by We talked about the pill About our current loves Our children and our ovules We laughed and carried on Unafraid of ridicule On a boat decked out with flags Loaded with abortion-ees In her teens or in her 40s It's the same disease Amsterdam-on-the-sea I'll remember Tulips and bikes, you see It can't be! It's great. Buy it. - You have some nerve! - May I? - Why? - For fun. For the abortus. - The abortus? - It's Dutch for “abortion.” You don't look Dutch one bit! No, I'm Iranian. Then I'll autograph it for you. “For an Iranian in memory of an abortus - Apple” Back then I thought often of your energy and resourcefulness... and I decided to get me and the kids out of that mess. I had to make some money and learn some skills any way I could. FOR SOCIAL WORKER INQUIRE WITHIN Miss? Thanks for bringing it! I need it back in three weeks. You think you'll manage? - Yes. I want to get work at the factory, but I'd need help with Mathieu. He's too young for school. Show me your kids. Good morning. But listen, you have no work history! I never paid much attention to that. Will you come in? No, let's go see the kids. I turned to you because there was no one else to ask. Ya shoulda learned at 16, instead of cattin' around. That's enough. You takin' her side? Stop bangin' on that machine! Next it was the women at the toy factory who helped me... with their discreet friendship and laughter. I felt better. I was accepted into the family of women. I need the rest. What for? Clothes and other things. - For foolishness. - That's just how it is. Mathieu, Marie, look! I'm so happy! See the money? I was so proud of my first pay. Things started improving. At night I studied so I could be a medical secretary down south. The kids would have the sun and free medical care. An ad in the paper led us here to Hyéres, into the sun and a job with a gynecologist. But he was shady, so after May '68 I started a Family Planning Center. I work here part-time. In the picture I'm sending... my office is squeezed between the winter and summer pools. I wish I could talk to you and show you where I live I have no time to write. Just a few words on a postcard. It was true. Though she longed to tell Apple everything, she never wrote the long letters they'd spoken of. But she and Apple built a bridge in the air... a dialogue in their imaginations, punctuated by postcards. And Apple too, busy with rehearsals for her tour and immersed in the odd group she worked with, wrote only postcards, which was her style anyway. From Apple to Suzanne, Suzanne to Apple... the postal traffic was the sign of a deep friendship... rather inexplicable for two women of such different tastes, character, and social backgrounds. Hi, Edith. We're late. Yes, we are. - How are things at home? - Fine. And you? Fine. How's Thierry? He's fine. Hello. - I'd like to talk to you. - Right away. Is this when you open now? I'm coming! Hi. Are you due soon? - Three weeks. - Have you chosen a name? Fabrice or Frangoise. Very nice. Will it be a boy or a girl? A diamond in the rough or a little pearl? A plum or a plume? Nectar or nectarine? What will be his fortune? What will be her fate? A prince consort or a princess? A commoner Of commoness? A little monkey or a donkey? Will he or she have Limpid pools like me Or a subtle gaze like yours? A boy with sex appeal? A girl with sex appeal? Oh, how I wish I knew - We can't have two pregnant women! - Stop being bossy. They're my songs. I won't have just any old backup. We're not any old backup. - You don't understand dance. - I say what I think. You talk too much. We live without talking. I live as best I can. Put me down. Okay, I talk too much. I'm tired. Let's break to eat and continue later. - I get it. Hi, Darius. - Hi, everyone. - When do we rehearse tonight? - I can't tonight. - Me neither, actually. - There goes the whole thing! Why? We just have to keep at it. Look, we rehearse for no pay. We're tired, and We're not even sure we'll get funding. I want a rest. - Well, so do I. With Darius, if you must know. But we have to make this project work. It's your project, so you're responsible. The Cultural Department told me it's in your name. So follow through. Fine, I'll call them. No rehearsal tonight. I get it. No money, no enthusiasm. - You exaggerate! - Never mind. No one noticed my costumes? Yes, they're beautiful. They sparkle. They're nice. Good evening. A glass of apple juice. Cinzano for me. This is for Suzanne. “My fictitious pregnancy... is going well. We'll give birth... to a fantastic show. Just wait and see. All my love.” I'm hungry, and I want to be alone with you. So we eat at my place? But I have nothing. We could buy some stuff. Let's make a real dinner. How can I help? Unwrap the chicken. Darn! My call to Favier! Go on. I'll do this. Mr. Favier, please. I'll wait. He's with the Cultural Department. - Use all the stuffing? - Yes. Think it'll work? Sure. Don't worry. How do I close it up? - I'll do it. Mr. Favier, please. This is Apple. Then I'll wait. 8:00? I'll call back then. They always keep you dangling when you need them most. Marie, see if the chicken's done, huh? “Please, Marie.” Please, Marie. It's not done yet. I'm hungry- Then you'll wait like us. Three more minutes. - For the chicken? - The phone call. - It smells good. - I have to make that call. I hope our goose isn't cooked. Maybe that Favier's a hypocrite. He said we had an interesting idea. But to whom? They say whatever they feel like. Mr. Favier's office, please. This is Apple. ls Mr. Favier there? Yes, I'll wait. He's on another line. I like Darius. He's great. Even I 777 amazed I fell for en economist. I hate economy of any kind. But we're in love. We touch and we're hypnotized. We want to hold on forever. Yes, I'll hold on. Once our show is on, life will be fantastic. He'll work for a French company. We'll meet daily... or at least nightly. He'll be there. Love. Present. Yes, I'm still here. Hello, it's Apple. Any news? It can't be! What will we do? I know you're not some wealthy patron, but you're leaving us in the lurch! You liked the idea! Why this? Can't we appeal or do a run-through for someone? You're sorry? Not as sorry as I am! No, I don'! understand! Good-bye! Bastards! We were practically ready. The whole thing's ruined! Apple... crying won't help. You know what? In Iran, the word for Persian is “farcee.” There's farcee cinema... farcee theater. Everything's farcee. Your dinner's not at all a farce. Yes, I can cook, but I want to sing and move too, and I can't with no money. I'm going to give up! I've had it! Calm down. I have an idea. I'll pay for a charter flight. Come to Iran with me. It's beautiful and far away. A change will do you good. And I have to go back. Come with me. The desert's magnificent. We'll be together. - It's an idea. - Will you come? Yes. Eat. So my departure was decided that day, thanks to a Mr. Favier at the Cultural Department. I chewed my chewy chestnuts... and thought... “Suzanne will never find me now.” Once in Iran, I felt I had become a postcard myself, or an extra in an artsy short film. ALSO SHOWING: THE PLEASURE OF LOVE IN IRAN AN EXOTIC, ARTISTIC, AND (VERBALLY) EROTIC SHORT IF ALL THE WOMEN OF THE WORLD... I don't know. Meaning what? That's how it is. That's idiotic! We explained it all to you six months ago. A doctor prescribed the pill for you. Did you buy it? - Yes. - But you didn't take it? - No. So you want a baby? Not at all. Why didn't you take it? Are you Catholic? I'm no longer a believer. Still, it kept you from taking the pill. Maybe. Either you believe or you don't. You're shouting? Yes, I know I'm being unpleasant. These should be group discussions. I'm yelling at a woman who wants the pill but won't take it. - We don't yell at people. - We should! I hate having to yell and push to make things happen. Then don't! You know about women's alienation. Piling on more orders and restrictions won't help them. True. But some days I get mad. I've been at it for years. Then stop or change your approach. What are you? An activist or a bureaucrat? Change... and women will change too. You're right. You're absolutely right. I'm glad you set me straight. - And you, Mathieu? - I'm doing better. “I'm far away. Darius has kidnapped me and I love it... but I haven't forgotten you.” I'm far away, it's wonderful here, and I'm in love. I've been gone six months. Time flies with Darius. We've found a place. I'm busy fixing it up. We're in the south now. Darius is here on business. We're near the desert, with no postcards around, so I'm writing a short note. I relate differently to my body here. Because of Darius, of course, but also because being far away, you feel sort of different. Among these veiled women I feel more nude than ever... closer to my body. I'm me. I mean... more than before. I feel new desires within me that are a bit mysterious. I'm crazy about the sun here. Give me a child. Hey, give me a child. I've gotten used to being alone. Sometimes it's hard... especially since - Well, I had an affair with a naval officer. I liked him at first. A sailor. He didn't take care of me or the kids, but he shook things up. He just jumped on me, and he did it well. He'd sail off. He'd come and go. Then I realized that navy men are military men. No, he wasn't the man for me. And ifs not easy having a lover with two Ida's in the next room. But he awoke me from a long sleep in which I wasn't a woman or anything. After our short affair, I became a woman. A woman on her own. Such a yearning to be a couple. It happened. I'm married. Darius is so pleased, especially since I'm pregnant. And I love parties. Yet the exchange of rings is quite poetic. The scent of the sacred mingling with sperm isn't bad. I liked it. Hello there. That's for me! - It's not a card. - No, it's a letter. Any news from my son? - A postcard. - Thanks. “Dear Suzanne, what a trip! I'm high. I'm flying. It's love, it's the Orient, etc. To be continued. No postcards in the desert. Apple, your flying carpet...” - Doing some writing? - Hello, Mrs. Armick. Apple, you're so far away. I can't even picture you. It's too exotic. I'm a bit down. Mathieu fractured his leg. It really scared me. The angel leap. I panicked. Mathieu was in pain, and so was I. Luckily a doctor was on board. He and his wife took charge and drove us to a hospital. I'd noticed him on the boat. A nice man, the striped-shirt type, always taking pictures. When he put Mathieu in his car and spoke to me... - Your leg okay? - It hurts. I feel like vomiting. ...something happened. I don't know what. Suzanne Galibier, with Family Planning. Ah, I often send women to you. I'm a pediatrician. His smile made me want to love him at once. But he's not free. It's over already. A sentimental letdown. I must seem so provincial to you with your Arabian Nights love story. But I'm writing anyway. My heart's being put through the mill, but I 'II manage. Love... Suzanne. He came by often to see to Mathieu's cast. He saw to Marie's tonsillitis too... and he'd have gladly seen to my solitude. Change subjects... and get a shot of the victim hounded by the ladies. Don't worry. I'll get my revenge. If we pull your leg, you'll get a second cast. I think he's sexy like this. Poor darling. Not since Jéréme has anyone looked at me like Pierre Aubanel does. The kids adore him. But it's no good. I don't want to love him. I want to be comforted. Dearest Suzanne... it's silly to be sad. Forget your married doctor. Find another man you like, fast. And if you do, send me a telegram. A thousand Persian kisses to the three of you. I walk along the streets. The women's world is in the markets and bathhouses. Then there's the men's world in the streets and cafés. It's like two separate worlds. The “couple” takes it on the chin. It has me asking questions. I've started writing songs again. Here it's hard not to become a mystic or a doddering fool. On the bridges of Isfahan - Julfa, Khajou, and Joubi - She said what? He said yes. She said, “Do that to me on Julfa” He said, “Do it all to me on Khajou. I'll forget about Joubi." - Is that you, darling? - Yes. You okay? Want some watermelon? Is dinner ready? Not yet. I haven't finished my work. You could have fixed something. I haven't finished this yet. You can write your songs while I'm at work. You have the time. I write when I'm inspired. I think I fell right in the trap, in my doll's house with my melon-belly and lover-husband. I'm acting starry-eyed, but it's not me. And the Iranian liberal I knew in France, the open-minded guy, feminist in his own way, back in Iran, on his home turf, once he knew I was hooked, became what he wanted to be all along: a traditional husband. I know I didn't marry a cook, but still. It was downhill from there. It was either fights or long silences. As I cook up a local dish, I'm fuming. I bitch and moan, feeling tricked, dazed, and a biz' happy... and totally baffled by this devil kicking inside me whom we await with love. It's better if I have the baby in France. We have very good doctors here. I know. It's for the surroundings, and for my mother. - Have you been here long? - I didn't want to interrupt. Just a second. Come see me anytime. - Good-bye, ma'am. Call me Suzanne. A doctor's daughter afraid to ask him for the pill. Classic. - You going home? - Once I've straightened up. - We could go for a walk... before you go home. No married men for me. Never again. - Ah, so that's it. - Yes. My kids' papers say “father unknown.” I've paid a high price. - It's not a question of children. - I know. I'm free. But I'm fed up with married men. - Do they fit? - Great. Too bad we don't see Pierre anymore. We had a bet on my first pair of shoes. After my cast came off, whoever said “new shoes” first would win. Too bad. You'd have won for sure. Mom, why doesn't Pierre come by anymore? You're both well now, and he's busy with work. For Suzanne things were clear, if difficult. Apple finally opened her eyes. In Iran she'd only seen what she wanted to see: a love story in an exotic setting. Now she had to flee that impossible land on the only carpet flying for her, a return flight, and go back to an active, tousled life of music. The problem was Darius, whom she loved so much. I'm not blaming you. I just won't be back. That's all. We'll talk when I get to France. It's due around the 20th? Let me know of any change. I leave here the 18th. What an unusual shape! It's pretty! Looks good on you. They wear it like this. Caviar by the spoonful! Want some? Too salty. Kids, come taste this. They look great. Very nice! I don't like that. Let me see that. Mom, can I borrow this? - For camping? Stop kidding. We'll show it to the Tourneau kids. I'm not giving it back. Don't be out too late. It's like I have nothing to tell you... or everything. I'll tell you something. First, though you don't like caviar, it's a treat for me. You look really good. I'm glad we'll be together for your first baby. We'll have fun. You know what I think about often? The look in their eyes outside Jérome's studio while that cop talked to you. I'll never forget that cop's face. I Will. That cop, the details - I've sort of forgotten. You talk to the kids about Jéréme? Not much. He was so unreal in a way. But I wish you'd tell them how good he was with them. Marie blames him, and Mathieu's confused. They can't understand his suicide. - You told them? I didn't go into detail. After the shock passed, I blocked it all out. His gentleness and anguish and fatalism. The silence. I thought “Careful, don't lose your grip.” It's different for me. I loved him. We were happy in our own way. The hard part came later, when I was alone, without him. It took me years to pull out of it. I had a hard time with men. I'd freeze up. So things weren't great, you know. - For a long time? - Yes. What about your married doctor? Pierre? I said no. I'll wait for a man who's free. You'd like him. And you'll meet, since he's our best pediatrician. - Let's have him over. - Sure, I'll just go out. No way to avoid Morn. She wants to be here for my first kid. Now that she's alone, she's a bit - Know what I mean? - Yes. When does Darius get in? - Tomorrow. - So you're happy? - Yes... but there'll be a scene, and I hate scenes. Maybe not. Does your Mom know him? Not yet. She'll tell him all about my childhood, the trumped-up choir trip. I was really a bitch with them. But I wanted the money for you for Switzerland. I never told you or anyone else... but I never went to Switzerland. Jéréme had sold a camera... plus I had your money. I thought of the rent and all our debts. I paid them instead. I saw the woman on Saint-Séverin. She used a probe on me. And that Tuesday you pretended you'd been in Switzerland. I had to. But that wasn't the end of it. There were complications. I had to go to the hospital. I'd lock the kids in and go mornings. There were complications. I can't have any more children. Did Pierre know that? I told him. Why do you ask? No reason. What a mess. We needed money so badly. I don't even remember the rest! I shouldn't have told you all that. Just think about your kid. I was just being selfish. I wanted to talk to you and cry with you. It's good to share things. Don't worry. We'll have this one together... and have fun. As for so many women, giving birth was a big moment for Apple. Eyes shining and heart pounding, she gave birth to a boy in the blaze of day. Let me have him a while. Go lie down. You've given me a wonderful son. Yes, darling. Parviz is a nice name. It's my father's. And Guillaume, to please Apple. That's a good middle name, right? He's too adorable! He really is. Come in. Hello, Doctor. Congratulations to all of you. I'm a little early. - Good. We'll know that much sooner if we have a winner. Everyone here thinks he's pretty wonderful. - How are you, Suzanne? - Fine. With Apple's visit, my life has changed. Mine too. I got divorced. - When? - Yesterday. I don't know what one says... There's nothing to say. - What about my baby? - I'll give him a thorough examination. I'll be going. Tell me everything later. Bye. Very convenient. The lady sees a foreigner she likes and off they go on a grand, exotic trip! A baby's born. She keeps it and sends the father home! Your French is impressive. And you didn't learn 20 words of Persian! You'll wake Guillaume! Where could I go to learn? I understood nothing! My sister speaks French. Not great, but still. You could have come with me. I did. For months. To watch you work. Meanwhile, I had no offers or contacts at all. I was a singer before we met, you know. You were tired of that. Yes, that day you asked me to go away. Don't mix the baby and your career. They're separate. You took me for a fool worth no more than some sperm. I don't like that. I won't allow this. I'm the head of this family. You wanted marriage and a baby. He bears my name. I live in Iran. I'm taking my son. Come if you want. End of story! End of story? I'm not going. Hungry, my little dumpling? Coming right up. Find him a wet-nurse. Or we can bottle-feed him. It takes two weeks to wean a baby. I can wait two weeks. My boss is gonna fire me anyway. Having a baby's such a tremendous feeling. Ask Suzanne. I was there when he was born. But you were so panicky, you didn't help much. Even so, I was glad you were there. Birth is so violent and savage. You feel like the baby's you. Now you can take him if you want to. Be the chief. Make the decisions. I love this baby as much as I love you. I love this baby as much as I love you. So what do we do? I don't know. I have a great idea. Give me another child. That way we'll each have one. But how? When? Are you crazy? We can't even decide about this one. I leave in two weeks. Just stay a while... until I'm rested up. Then, nice and easy, you give me another child. That's crazy. It won't work. I never heard of such a thing. Another crazy idea. It's unrealistic. Think about it. You should come live in Iran. No, that's over. No more phony images and stereotypes. That's over. If you love me... let's do that, and we'll each have a child. You're crazy. No, I'm being realistic for once. Maybe you are... Are you coming? Let me have him. He's no problem. It's all the other stuff. If you change your mind, write to me. Of course. Now what? I don't know what I'm doing. I don't like leaving you or Suzanne. I'm staying three months. It's settled. You two will be okay alone. I mean you three. Right, it'll be our grand finale, fireworks and all. Don't get melodramatic. I do what I can. It's not much, but I try. I'm back with the group, the girls I sang with before. We're taking up our battle song again, but in a new style. I'm Woman I'm me Neither goddess Nor devil Nor escapade When you two have left, I'll go live in the country with the group. My life will be fresh air and music. You say it all so calmly. Sure, since you've promised me another kid. Not so fast! It's not done yet. I can feel it. And it will be a girl. I love you. I love you too, even if we're the flop of the century. So Darius returned to Iran with five-month-old Parviz. From the airport, a tearful Apple sent Suzanne a postcard. It's done. Farewell, Sun. I've lost a husband and child. I'll do my best... We're going on tour. I'm pregnant. I'm happy and unhappy... Apple. Neither goddess Nor devil Nor escapade I'm Woman I'm me Neither fetish Nor trophy Nor chambermaid I'm Woman I'm me Come hear us... tonight at 9:00. I made you a nice little fire. Granny, how about pitching in here? I feel low, and I know nothing about cars. You think we're ace mechanics? I'm getting tired of winter... cold feet, icy halls... a heavy heart, sick to my stomach. But at least no more morning sickness, and I'm glad days are growing longer. Work's going well. The Orchids and I get along well. It's really the good life. Funny thing when you're alone: Happy or not, you behave the same. Yet I'm very happy. I've seen Pierre again. We get along well. I think of him over my coffee between my morning swim and my afternoon at the Center, alone at noon as usual, since the kids eat at school. He stays in Toulon for lunch. I feel calm and dreamy. What a lovely month of March. Hey, can you take me along? What's your name, kiddo? Zorro. That's a great name. Wanna come along? - Yes. So the morn walked out and left you with the kid? Yup. I guess you're an unwed father. Yeah, you could say that. Poor little dumpling. It's okay. We manage. Little snowball. When you're almost a mom You have to think for two Pregnancy is fleeting What must one do for a newborn daughter So she won't be at a disadvantage in life? What must one do to educate a son Before he's born? When you're almost a mom You have to think for two Pregnancy is fleeting You have to take the bull by the horns And the road as it comes, mile by mile Make it all up And don't be afraid Living in the atomic era You must educate the chromosomes Educate them before they become... Men! Pregnancy is fleeting WHERE ARE YOU? EXCITING NEWS: PIERRE AND I ARE GETTING MARRIED. TENDERLY... SUZANNE Morn, where are the scissors? On my dresser. No, they're by my bed. For your hair or fingernails? - It's for Mom's wedding. You'll see. - Sweetie... polish your shoes. They need it. Sailors mean good luck! Long live the bride! Look at that beautiful wedding dress. Let's go. We look like poor relations. Like a common-law couple. - Not common at all. - And deeply in love. We look artsy. - Who cares? - You don't? Hardly at all. I'll get a picture. Where's my camera? You have to be in it. Group pictures look so corny. You're single? Yes, with one child that someone else is raising. I mustn't have another one. No need to justify yourself. I'm a waitress in a restaurant, so I meet guys from time to time. Maybe it's time you took the pill. After I scuttle this one. - You say “scuttle”? - Yes. Mom, I need you to sign a paper. I'll be right back. Elise is right there. Nice wedding? Super. Quick and easy. Sort of incognito. And Morn had a ball. - Did you have a party? - Nothing bourgeois. We played records and Scrabble. Real cool. Anne, come look. - Why did they get married? - I don't know. Maybe for his patients. To me it seems sort of - If he's simpatico, okay. I'd rather just live with a guy. Anyway, that's still far off. But no kids before I'm 25. Where you been? We've been waiting. Cool it. I don't like bossy dames. Women's Lib rules. Like it or not, pal. DOMESTIC HABITS She works a double shift Poor Mom It's exhausting And underpaid Friedrich Engels once did say That in the families of today The man is the bourgeoisie And woman is the proletariat He was right Papa Engels He was right Because at home Man is the bourgeoisie And woman is the proletariat We can think about the problem And talk with those we love We can dream about it And act and make changes Want something to drink? I'm thirsty. No, don't move. What's wrong? Marie's not home yet. She didn't say a word. The nerve! Let her be. She needs to have a few secrets. Why? I've never kept her from going out. You're her mom. That's enough. I'm supposed to let her run wild at 16 and keep my trap shut? Calm down. Remember what you say about sexual oppression of the young and how women must make their own decisions. She's taken all that in. - Sure. And she's heard tons about taking the pill. She might get pregnant out of spite. She's a smart girl. Leave her alone. You think I'm a nag? No... just a morn. So you want to be a Chinese interpreter? - Maybe. - What's it depend on? I never decide in advance. I want to be sure. Are you sure right here and now? Not really. It's all such a cliché. Meaning? A boy, a girl, night, hugs, etc... - You're a feminist like your mom? - Yes. - Seriously? - Enough not to fall for your schemes. We're not always scheming. A lot of times We're for real. Okay, fine. - You okay? - Yeah. - What are you scared of? - Okay, I'm scared. Happy now? Don't be a pain. You've never slept with a guy? - Right. - You want to or not? - I want to be sure I want to. - Aren't you free? When a guy asks a girl that, it means will she put out the moment he whistles? I hate that. Where's the fire? - Then I'll wait. - That's right, you will. If a Child I'm willing to hatch If one day We have a hot love-match It'll be a child of Love It'll be good, It'll be right We'll reproduce With passion But if for reasons that I hide or show My love for you doesn't start a glow Nor an heir in me It's because love is sufficient To both our lives as happy lovers My body's mine Bye, Frangois. So long, Zorro. See you soon. So long, ladies. Thus the river continued on, as did their chance acquaintances, and the tour itself. Apple wrote new songs and quietly awaited her second child. She received few postcards from Suzanne. They made her want to go see her all the more. This is Micou and Joélle. Now we'll sing one called “The Bubble Woman.” We put on fake bellies for this, except this one, which is real. When you have a big belly, it always provokes reactions. Oh, it's good to be a bubble It's so nice To be a balloon A workshop for molecules A beautiful ovule A cell factory A big fat fish Your song's ambiguous, you know. The “right to life” movement could sing it too. You even make women who don't want kids feel guilty. I'm not saying to have kids. I say when you're pregnant you should feel things yourself... and not listen to the church or state. I use various images of woman to express how I feel in songs. Oh, it's good to be a fat dream It's so nice to be a balloon A green tree filled with sap A rising loaf of bread A cookie with a fortune inside A harvest It's nice to be a ball It's beautiful to be a balloon Like a soft and downy hen Like flowing milk Like a pigeon cooing To her nestling Oh, it's good to be a woman It's so nice To be a balloon A body of fire and flame A body and soul A peaceful body, a deep nest A song After the wedding, Suzanne's life continued at the pool, the Women's Center, and her home. - How are you, Mrs. Aubanel? - Can't one live as she wishes? Despite the sarcasm from her leftist daughter, Suzanne felt comfortable being married after so many years as a social misfit. She and Pierre opened a baby swim program. A marriage too was something two people made together. Meanwhile, Apple gave birth a second time, in pain and exaltation, to a girl named Suzanne. Then she went on tour again with the Orchids. They all had fun raising the baby together. Apple rolled along, living her life. When she had the occasional boyfriend, she quickly saw if he was her kind of man. .. or just a man. She wasn't about to take up with some louse. She lived with the group, yet alone, alone with little Suzanne, Darius's gift. One summer two years later, for once Suzanne and Apple met without a tragedy, birth, or panic. For once I! was a vacation with friends in a big rented house. They laughed, ate, went walking... and made music. And they looked at old photos they'd brought specially. They compared pictures and had discussions. Apple was proud of her little Suzanne, who had lots of aunts and a few uncles instead of a father. A true family. And she dreamed of the day Darius would also come on vacation, with Parviz Guillaume and no doubt a new wife and child. Apple was still as optimistic as ever. - Who's that? - Papa. Marie had changed. She was 17 and had a boyfriend Théodore, whom she introduced as "Théoduddy, my close buddy. ” Joélle and Micou hadn't changed. Frangois I, from back in Bobigny, was now living with Doudou. He sometimes went along on their tours. Zorro, son of Frangois II, now “normalized” by school, still lived with his unwed father. The were constant companions during school vacations. Marie was a senior and still wanted to study Chinese. She also wanted to be a photographer, like her father. Apple felt good. She loved the soft summer twilights by the lake. Mathieu had changed. He was at times very shy, at times very trusting of Pierre, who truly suited Suzanne, a patient and passionate woman. Pierre was proof she'd made a success of her life. All was going well for her... for them. Suzanne also loved seeing that Apple was finally happy and true to herself after struggling so hard with herself and others. Their friendship flowed easily. True, they were different. One sang, the other didn't. But they were alike too. They'd fought to gain the happiness of being a woman. Maybe their optimistic struggle could help others - like Marie, who was becoming a woman. No one thought it would be easier for her, but perhaps simpler and clearer...
