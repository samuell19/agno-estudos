Zeiram has escaped. Capture him immediately. Dead or alive. Our names are lria and Bob. Registration number 9799-5. We accept. Others may not intervene. Yes! Keep the change. Buy yourself a Mercedes. How's it going, Murata. I'll treat you to drinks again tonight. -You won the money from that race? -That's right. Damn, I thought I was gonna win. Kamiya. Kamiya! Are you sure you're going to treat me? Yeah. Thanks a lot. Takahashi Electronics Listen, I apologize. They asked me to take over for somebody. So let's change the time. What time? Hold on. Yeah, I said it'll be until 6. Yeah, okay. Bye. Thanks. So, where's he? Kamiya said he is going to be waiting here. -Maybe he went to gamble on a horse. -Are you kidding? -He took the company car with him. -You mean that flashy car? Yes. The clothes are flashy enough. You mean these, right? Hey, isn't that Kamiya? You saw him? Where did he go? That way. Then I'll be off now. Thanks again. -You forgot the receipt. -Yes, the receipt. -Thanks. -See ya. Kamiya! Kamiya! Kamiya! Kamiya! You said you'd be waiting over there. Look, I said I'm sorry. Don't be so mad. You think I want to be working on a Sunday? But a beautiful woman dropped something. If I didn't give it back to her, I wouldn't be a man, now would I? -Did you show her how manly you are? -No, she fled from me. What did she drop? This. What? What's with the look? I mean you're dressed all funky. Plus you were running around carrying an apple. You scared her away. What can I do? This is what they make us wear for work. She reminded me of my late wife when she was younger. Late wife? I know she really just left you, right? You knew about it? You're mean. I'm sorry. -Where should we go first? -I'll let you decide. I already told the boss, but I have to be out by 6. -I know that. I'll take over after 6. -Thank you. I already made plans with Murata at Momonga. At 5. What? We'll never finish by 5. What are we going to do? You want the apple? No, thank you. You're going to eat it anyway. -Who told you that? -What? About my wife. The secretary girl, Yumi? Am I right? -I hear you guys are getting intimate. -Kamiya! -How far did you get? Did you kiss her? -Nevermind that. I'm only doing this until 6. I know that. You're trying to change the subject. You have a date with Yumi. -That's great, Teppei. -What are you saying? -That's great! -Watch it! Count on bounty hunters lria and Bob Welcome back, lria. Oh, you already mastered the language? You're amazing as usual. Yeah. The language for this planet sounds nice and is easy to learn. Did you find what you were looking for? I'm sure it'll be fine. Besides, I don't have much time. They look like primitive tools. Stop complaining. I had time to go shopping after I finished learning the language. Okay. Fine. He's going to arrive in about two hours. Will you have the teleportation device ready? There's no choice, is there? I placed an electromagnetic barrier by the entry course. I'm sure the people of this planet won't notice. lria. All we need to do is to select the Zone. Can we capture him without using the Zone? That's impossible. You know that. -This planet's civilization number is... -It's 36. They show no signs of being willing or able to cooperate with the capture. I know that, Bob. That's good. But, when we use a Zone, 30% of our reward is taken away. There's nothing we can do about that. You knew there was life on this planet. Yes. But didn't you have enough time to... ...come up with a better plan than to use a Zone for the capture? lria, we're a team and... ...| came up with the plan this time. I want you to follow it. Hey, that's not fair. Your plans are too extreme. If we break any laws this time, we'll never be able to work again. I didn't know you cared. I need the maintenance fee to keep on going. -You only care about yourself?. -No, this is for the both of us. We can pay back our debts after this job. I thought I laid out a perfect plan that fits your personality. If we get him into the Zone, then he'll be ours. I don't know what his plans are on this planet... ...but I'm sure he doesn't expect to end up in a Zone when he arrives. Even though I try to stop you, you always go to far. -Then we end up having to pay money for... -Bob. Stop complaining. If you keep talking, I'll give you a virus. No. I don't want a virus. Anyway, are you sure this point is okay? We set up a field inside the Zone... ...but if he changes his course, then it'll be a total loss. Okay, lria. You can count on me. That's why I'm your partner. Unbelievable. We're running short on time and you bought that! "Here, Yui." "I thought this might look good on you." Huh? What did you say? -Beautiful, aren't they? -Yes. -Did someone die? -Stop messing around! It's a present for my lady at Momonga. I see, I see. She'll be so happy! "Oh, Mr. Kamiya, you shouldn't have. Thank you." That's what she'll say! There's probably not many guys out there like me. Bob, I'm done with my part. Is that good? Pretty good. You want some? No thanks. He looks tough. Yeah, he's not like the others we've fought before. But he's alone, isn't he? What's his power level? This is only my guess but...it's over 87. -Is that including weapons? -I'm analyzing that right now. But it's not clear. I can handle 87. It'll be over in 5 minutes if I set a trap. lria, I didn't say 87. I said over 87. Use the type 4 weapon. Isn't that a bit too gaudy? -It looks good on you. -I don't think that matters. lria, I'm done registering the Zone. Hurry up and get ready. I'll have to go pretty crazy for that 30% fee to be worth it. Fine. The system has been completed. Hurry up and enter the name. Fine. I'm getting his name. Zone name 'Zeiram' ZEIRAM Begin searching Zone Purpose for use-combat/capture Special field setting-No lifeforms Scanning in progress for available dimension Space coordinates locked Unregistered planet [2095-813] Zero point confirmed, Town of Mikasa Specifying range of combat field Separating walls on field Identifying material composition data on field Constructing materials on field Securing gate for dimension portal Isolation of combat field completed The situation got kind of complicated. But I'm finished now. - I think I'll be there little after 6... -Teppei! Hold on a second. Yes, I'm coming. I'll be there soon. Bye. -You talk too long. -Sorry. Clean up quickly. We're already running late. I understand. Oh no. See? They're paging us now. I'll call them. Tell them we can't do it because we've got other jobs. Why do you always have to be the yes-man? They told me that someone is stealing electricity...it's an emergency so... Amateurs. When I find out who did this, I'll slap 'em real good. Should we just cut this off? No, we don't know what they're doing inside. Then what are we going to do? We'll go inside. What? -I'll buy you a drink after we finish. Okay? -No, I have plans after this so... Oh, that's right. You have a date with Yumi. Date with Yumi. That's great. Sorry about that. You're a lucky guy, Teppei. I can never tell what you young folks are doing these days. You sly dog. Now, Bob. Are we ready? Okay. It's showtime. It's not like that. So you guys do dinner and a movie? Don't worry about me. This is something. Is this some kind of set for a movie? Those bastards always steal electricity. Hello? Hey! Hello? Anybody here? Looks like nobody's here. Isn't it dangerous leaving them on like this? Hey Kamiya, let's just leave a note and go home. Huh? Right here. Al right. Zeiram entering the atmosphere What was that? What? He disappeared... Hey, Teppei! Teppei, where did you go? Teppei! What in the world happened? Where did he go? Excuse me... Hey, I saw you this afternoon... You dropped an apple, right? My partner just disappeared. What's going on? What are you doing? Hey, hey, hey! Are you listening to me? You're a foreigner, aren't you? Do you understand Japanese? -Zeiram has arrived. - I know. So you can speak. Ouch! What are you doing? Things are getting problematic... What the hell? You're so rough. Huh? How come we're outside? What is this place? Hey! What's going on here? Well? Hey, wait a minute! Hey, you! What the hell? What is this? What are you doing? How do you like the Zone this time? I don't think Zeiram is aware of the Zone yet. Did you set the trap? It's good to go. That's the capsule he came in. I want you to destroy it. Fine. Huh? This phone doesn't work either. What the... Excuse me. One of you folks tampered with the utility pole, right? Where's the person in charge? Right behind me? That thing doesn't shoot bullets, does it? That's dangerous. Stop messing around! Hello, Zeiram. Welcome! Bob. I lured him to the capture point. Okay. Huh? Do you know what this is? Huh? Kamiya? Kamiya! Kamiya! Goodbye, Zeiram. Bob, the guns won't work. Be careful. He's using a shield. Huh? Bob, I'm using the suit. No. Don't fight him in close combat. Is that all you got? lria, what happened? Answer me. lria, there's a trap unit underneath you. lria, the save-gun is behind you. Right behind you. Bob, can you hear me? I got him. Okay, lria. Good job. Be careful. There's something approaching behind you. You scared me. You see, I'm from the electric company. -I almost forgot about you people. -What? Well, it's about this thing. My partner is stuck inside one of these things. He was getting in my way, so I put him in there. What? Hey... Wait a minute! Do you get it now? We're in an alternate dimension. You're right. Did you just see that, Kamiya? -She must be... -You keep your mouth shut. Great. Telling us all these things we don't understand! You stole electricity and then you locked me up. Can't you be a bit nicer? lria, what are you doing? We need to dispose of Zeiram immediately. Sorry, I'll move to a larger area. -Hey you! Are you listening to me? -Be quiet. I'm not supposed to be talking to you people. I see. -What do you mean? -She can't talk to us. You idiot! What a thing to say! You're the one who brought us here. -Stop talking nonsense. -What do you mean? You're the one who followed me. What? Let's just forget about that for a second. -What do you mean he followed you? -Nothing. -What are you doing? Don't help her. -What's wrong, lria? You shouldn't talk with them. I know that, Bob. - I want you to dispose them first. -Dispose? -We're not garbage, you know! -Kamiya! Excuse me, but...is that thing dead? - I just captured him. -Captured? What's that? You know what? That thing tried to kill me. Really? Don't move. Fine. Just hurry up and do it. Bob. Whenever you're ready. Okay. I picked the location. What the hell? Kamiya, look! What the hell is this thing? They're gone. Hey. Hey! Hey! lria, we have a problem. The transport unit is broken. What did you say? What's Zeiram's condition? Don't worry. He's perfectly secured. -Hey, Teppei Yes? I'll ask you once more. What is this place? Well, how can I explain it... In this world, the town exists but there are no people. That's how I look at it. Was that written somewhere? Was that written on some billboard? No, that's what that woman said. What the hell... I thought there might be a radio somewhere, but I can't tell what these are for. -You wanna take a look? -Nope. You look very calm. Don't you sense imminent danger? If that thing is there, then she'll come back for it. Let's just wait. Are you sure it's safe? Maybe it's still alive. If it's secured like that, I'm sure we'll be fine. Do you want something? You might want to have a weapon just in case. -Do you know how to use it? - I think so. What else is inside? Take a look at this. Here. What the hell! That's a cockroach! I wonder what she plans to do with this. -Is she going to eat it? -Don't say that. It's disgusting. I don't like cockroaches and women who talk loud. But we'll have to eat this in time of need. It's survival, Kamiya. Survival, huh? I can't believe it's this late. Oh? You got an interesting thing there. Did you get it from Yumi? No. -You don't have to hide it. -No, it wasn't. -Really? -Yes. There was a photo attached to it. You saw it? I saw it. So you saw it. I have one too. -What is it? -A picture of my lady at Momonga. Let me see that. Here, this is me and that's her. Every time I flip it... ...she says "You taste like cigarettes every time we kiss." Ouch! What should I do? Teppei! Hit him, stab him...do something! Weapon...that weapon... Oh. Hurry up! -Do I pull this thing? -How should I know? Hurry! Hot! Hot, hot, hot! Hot, hot, hot! I did it! No time to relax. Isn't there another weapon? You suck! Give me that! Direct hit. You're amazing, Kamiya. War veterans like you can do it all. You idiot! I never went to war. What did you say about survival? You can't do anything on your own. Kamiya... Kamiya... What? lria, is it fixed yet? I just need to fix this unit. -What's wrong? -I can't believe this. Zeiram escaped. I can't believe he broke through that hardened rubber. You better get back fast. Those two are in danger. He's gone, Kamiya. What the hell is that thing? I'm not gonna capture him alive. I'm counting on you, Bob. What happened, Bob? What is it? -Fuse blew because of a short circuit. -What do you mean? I'm checking right now. Calm down, lria. I'm calm, okay? I have to do it again? Can't you do anything about it? What did you do? This is bad. The Zone's maintenance unit is broken. What? That scared me. What the hell? You scared me. Now, we'll be stripped of our license. No way. I won't allow it. But now, those two won't live much longer. For that, our license will be revoked forever. You're always like this. Listen. We can't give up. We just have to hope those two can run fast. We have to calm down and think. What happened, Teppei? There's something here, Kamiya. What? What is this? It looks like a wall. You idiot! I can see that... I can't see it. What are you saying? What do we do? Can't help it. -Let's go back. -Yes. Bob, can you send them a transceiver message? I think that can be arranged. Do it quickly. I want to talk to them. What are you going to do? Just do as I say. I'll have them fight Zeiram. You mean those humans? Their power level is nothing compared to Zeiram. I'll teach them how to fight him. Plus that young one seems like he can move. I'll be fixing the transport unit during that time. You'll use them as tools? If the authorities find out, you'll be in big trouble. They'll be killed if we do nothing. -But we haven't done this before. -Bob! Let's see... Take this here, and... Kamiya, where did you learn how to do things like that? When is that woman going to come? Don't shake it. Give me more light. Sorry. How about... ...this? That's amazing. I'll drive. It's all up here. It's all about survival, isn't it? I don't trust your survival instincts. Kamiya, look! What do we do? Step on it! Go! -Move it, move it! -I'm trying! Reverse! Go reverse and crush him! Is he dead? He better be. I don't think he survived that. Ouch! Are you okay? Yeah, I was wearing my safety belt. Oh no! Teppei! Teppei! What the hell is this thing? Stop! Stop it! What the hell is this thing? Hurry up, Teppei! Teppei! Teppei! What is this thing? It's sticky and disgusting! Teppei! Teppei! Teppei! Hurry up and get out of there! -Kamiya! -It hurts, it hurts! It hurts! That bastard bit me! Hurry! I banged my hip! This face. It's quite annoying. This mouth is probably used for absorption. And? If my data is correct, he absorbs the organism using this mouth... ...and uses their cells depending on the situation. What do you mean? Basically, he uses them as nutrients and in other cases, he has used them... ...to clone his subordinates. So they will become his food? I don't know, but if he's a biological weapon created a long time ago... ...his main body is the hat, and the rest is just a unit. I didn't expect to meet a forbidden biological weapon like this. Momonga Ouch! Man, this doesn't look good. This doesn't look good? Why didn't you use the gun? You have to help me. I'm sorry. Damn it! I would've been here drinking by now. I'm going to close this up now. If I'm not around, this place is dead. -This place? -Yeah. Let's get this started! -Hey, what happened to Kamiya? -Don't know. Murata. Yes. -Are you drinking? -Yes, I am. But you know what? What's the matter?. Kamiya isn't here yet. -You mean that Kamiya? -Yeah. He said he'd buy me a drink since he won at the races. Then I think he's going to bring something. Hey, take a look at that. -Kamiya's a great guy. -Are you kidding? I don't like him. You see? My lady is talking about me right now. Hey Teppei. Don't take that out. I'm very hungry, so I thought I might eat it. -You can't eat that. It'll kill you. -No, I think it's food. It smells kind of funny, but... Stop! Don't do it! Please don't! This is pretty good. You want a bite? Are you kidding? I can't eat that! -So disgusting... -Pretty good. I'm outta here. I don't want to be around a guy who eats cockroaches. Kamiya! Wait! Because of the earlier power failure, the coordinates for the Zone are unstable. I found them. They're both together. I really want to talk to them. I'd rather not do this. I'm sure everything will work out. There's another wall here, Kamiya. What? Let's just wait here. How can you be so calm? -I'm kind of thirsty. -That's because you ate a cockroach. Give me a cigarette. Light? -That's too much light. -Kamiya. Can you hear me? Push the red button if you can hear me. H-Hello? That's good. Is the other guy with you? Yes, he's here with me. Can you get here fast? Listen, I have pieces of bad news. -First, the transport unit broke down. -Then what's going to happen to us? -What's the other one? -The place you're in will disappear soon. What about us? -If worst comes to worst... -Worst? Does it get any worse than this? So... So I have a favor to ask of you. I want you two to fight that creature. Are you crazy? How are we supposed to fight that monster?. Listen very carefully. Just do what I say. You get here as fast as possible. We'll do our best to survive. I agree. There's no need to put them in a dangerous position. That's not true. If they keep attacking, it's the same as protecting themselves. What kind of attack could they possibly produce? Hey, what are you arguing about? We don't have much time. Get over here as soon as possible! I'm talking to you because I can't get there! Could you just be quiet? What? Now you're ordering us? I'm hanging up now. We're going to hide in a safe place. Later! Wait, don't hang up! Hiding would be much more dangerous. Listen, you just do as I say. If you do... I'm sorry. I think I should calm down. Hey, what do I call you people? At least give me your names. Tell us yours first. I guess this is what you call manners. It was in the data. I'm lria. I'm Kamiya and he's Teppei. You got another one, right? My partner Bob. Now Kamiya, listen to me once more. Kamiya, look! What is it? What's going on? Bob, do something! I can't. It's no use. I can't control the zone. If you two can hear me, say something! We're finished. Forget about capturing Zeiram. What? Are we going to leave those two out there and flee? We have to pay the penalty, but we have no other choice. -That's not what I meant. -Yes, I know. I should've kept my cool when those two wandered in there. Just you wait, Zeiram. I'll get you back for this. Kamiya! Weapon! Use the weapon! Take this! Take this too! Kamiya? lria, can you hear me? Teppei, are you okay? Amazing. It's a miracle. That monster came out of nowhere and Kamiya... Is he dead? I don't know. He protected me and I fled the scene. Can't you tell what's going on? No, coordinates for the Zone are unstable. lria, I think I'll fight him. What should I do? Tell me. Thank you. I should thank you too. It's good to have at least one of you alive. Bob. -We'll use the Metis cannon. -No. We don't have permission. It'll take two weeks to get the approval. Who cares about approval? Wait a minute. I don't want to be a fugitive. Are you going to leave Teppei to die? Don't worry, it's going to work. You're always like this, lria. We haven't even paid for that thing. The Zone's not going to last 30 minutes. Things will get worse if we don't do something. Let's think it over. Bob! Fine, I'll send it over. I'll say one thing regarding its use. I'm definitely against it. I'll record this as evidence for the trial. If we use the Metis cannon, that monster can be... Teppei, I'm sending you a weapon. Okay. But can we send it to Teppei's location? Can't we specify the exact location? We can send it to zero point without a doubt. Where's zero point? Right here. Teppei, are you listening to me? Yeah, I'm listening. Do you know where the zero point is? I do. I have to go there, right? I'm sending you a large silver briefcase. The Metis cannon is inside. Inside a huge briefcase? Got it. lria, I'll be waiting. I'll definitely get there. Bob, I want you to quickly transport the Metis cannon. Kamiya! Ouch! Are you okay? That was not cool. Go away! Go away! Stop! Stop! Go away! Get lost! lria! Sorry to keep you waiting. Stay back. You did it. I thought you'd never come. Bob, I got him. Be careful, I don't think you can take him out with a bazooka. What the hell is he? Even though he's a skeleton, he's still alive. lria, use that again! I can't. I had only one shot. Teppei, the Metis cannon is inside the building. Got it. -What's that? -Just come with me! -What's wrong? -It's not here. Bob, where did you send the cannon? Answer me! Sorry, I sent it to the floor above you. This way. -We can kill that thing with the cannon? -Keep moving! I can't make it. Just go on without me. -Kamiya! -He'll come for us if we don't hurry. I know that. Why do I have to go through this mess? Leave it to me. I'll try to hold him for a while. Okay. You're so cool. Hey! Don't destroy the entire building! There it is! Is this it? How do you open this thing? I got it. No! Go away! Get lost! How do you use this thing? Help! lria! Umm, lria... Uh, um...aren't you cold? You're definitely a fine looking woman. Thanks. Bob, can you hear me? The zone will perish in 8 minutes. He's finished. Good job. What about the two humans? Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. I guess we're back. We're safe at last. lria, transport Zeiram. No way. You're Bob? Really? That's right. We can talk later. I need you two to stay back. I'm going to transport Zeiram. Okay. Now lria. Sorry to ask you, but can you move that aside? Go! You go! It's still alive! Here he comes, Teppei! Don't! What the hell are you? I know I keep asking that, but... Bob, what's going on? Zeiram destroyed the transport unit. Bob, how many minutes until the zone disappears? Answer me! Don't do it, Teppei! Teppei! Bob, hurry up! Hold him down! Get the other side, Teppei! Come here for a second, Kamiya. Now's not the time! The transport unit is broken. What? What's gonna happen to lria? Teppei! Hold him down! -I can't, not by myself! -Just do it! What should I do? The cord from the transport unit is damaged. You probably know how to fix it. What? Hurry up, Kamiya! Hang in there, Teppei! Why did you have to make something so complex? Hurry up, Kamiya! It's not ready yet? It's connected. What next? Okay. Push the button by the pillar. Kamiya! Help me, Kamiya! Kamiya! Kamiya! Kamiya! Right above you! Right above you! Hurry! Hurry up, Kamiya! lria. The zone just disappeared completely. He was an unbelievable foe. Oh, yeah. I forgot. Hey. Teppei. Your date was at 5:30, wasn't it? Are you okay? -Are you okay? -I'm okay. I'm okay. You were really something. No, no. That was all you. Thank you. Take it. That's her way of saying thank you. I see. I guess this is goodbye. You all fought well. I hate to ask you this, but could you step forward? What? -You want me to fix something else? -No. I want to capture your brave image. What? Us? -You keep out, Teppei. -Kamiya. I'm just kidding. It's a commemorative photo, right? Come on.
