Lina! Max! - Thank god. - Why are you in such a hurry? - I don't know. - Did you not see me? No. It can happen with all the hustle and bustle here in Paris. When did we…? Good afternoon! - When did you arrive? - Can you wait in the hotel? - I've got to discuss something with you. - I haven't really got much time. - Maybe on the way to the press conference. - Sure. This year we've decided to restrict the activities of Solidarity Inter- national to 3 main objectives. The 1st focal point is the release of all arrested workers, who were arrested because their opinions were contrary to those in power. Secondly we emphasize that Irish republicans in imprisonment in Britain, should receive the status of political prisoners. Thirdly, we wish to make it part of our campaign, that prisoners, who suffer torture in Latin America, are released, especially in Chile und Bolivia. Bravo! These 3 main issues constitute the will of our movement. To protect human rights, there where they are normally spurned. I hope that you will appreciate our efforts in your article accordingly. And the situation in South Africa? Our movement has had success there, despite reprisals… and the torture, which is customary in such countries. If the nations involved cannot solve the apartheid problem alone, then all Africa will start to waver. Should the French government intervene? We don't give advice, Soli- darity International states facts. The government has to judge for itself. It's rumoured that they wish to lay down their mandate. More important, is the Solidarity International, not the president. They can rumour, Mademoiselle. How do you reconcile your function with Solidarity International with that as holder of a Swiss insurance company. Don't answer. It's only provocation. Oh, it's you. It seems to aggrieve you when money acts for freedom. I've accumulated a fortune. It gives me neither fame nor disgrace. Will you travel to Teheran to obtain the release of trade unionists? Can you answer, please? Our President is always there, where help is needed, be it in Teheran or Washington. Max Baumstein will protest to the ambassador from Paraguay tomorrow against the arrest of the young English woman Betty Healy. She was arrested and tortured by the men in power. - Max? - Yes? I miss the house. Me even more. I've been dreaming about dinner in Geneva for 2 weeks. - Just the two of us? - Yes, and quiet. Spaghetti with a lot of butter. Yes? In half an hour. I reserved a table in the hotel. Yes, me too. See you later. Mr. President… The solicitor is about to arrive, Charles and the lovely Annie. Then I suppose I'll get out. Are you crazy? I'm a friend of Solidarity and have something for Mister Baumstein. Thank you, I'll give it to him. - What is it? - An envelope for you. Open it! - They're probably documents for tomorrow. - Show me! Which one? I brought you something from New York. And what is it? What is it? What is it then? What is it then? You're insane. Max Baumstein is insane. Thanks, Max! That's great. Look! Where? Max! You shouldn't get yourself worked up! - What's up with you? - Nothing! Did I annoy you? I have to go! You're hardly there before you leave me again. Oh please. - OK, then I'll go with you. - No. - Don't be so stubborn. - Do you think you're not? Goodbye, Raimond. Excuse me, did this used to be a Cabaret? - When? - Before the war. - No idea. - Goodbye, Mac. The exile song, please. Are you denying that Betty Healy was arrested by the secret police. She was never in our country, that means she could never be arrested. I think I've expressed myself clearly. You are obstructing the course of justice. Set Betty Healy free! So there's nothing you can do with the matter? My government has proved that it is of the best will. The affair, which has been highlighted by the enemies of our country, is aimed at harming our President. So there's no hope? Unfortunately not. I'm sorry for this young person… and for you. Yes. Mr. Ambassador, it appears to me, that in 1933 you were an employee of the Germany Embassy in Paris. That's right. What's that got to do with anything? If my memory serves me right, you were then called Ruppert von Leggaert. Yes, that's right. Do you recall a woman named Elsa? Elsa Wiener? Elsa Wiener? Wiener… - Elsa and Michel Wiener, Herr Ruppert von Leggaert. Yes, I remember… vaguely. Monsieur le President: Why? It's all such a long time ago. Charles, my briefcase, please! I'd like to show you something. Max! I've just killed the ambassador from Paraguay. You shot the ambassador! They're still looking for a reason for the murder of the ambassador. Only yesterday, Max Baumstein gave a press conference to explain the aims of his movement's new programme. Baumstein is founder and President of Solidarity International. Paris. Today the government passed three new bills. Two of them concern industry and trade. The third has to do with Spain's new NATO membership. The Minister for economics submitted a plan for the expansion of research and development of micro electronics. It's me, Guefroy. You can visit him! - Just one picture! - Let us go! No pictures, please be reasonable! Please, not here! You've got half an hour. I'll wait outside. Have you got a cigarette? Did they not leave you with your stick? They took everything from me. But in a very polite way. How are you allowed to visit me? It's all thanks to Guefroy. He really looks after you. - Max? - Yes? - I'll always stand by you. - I know. - There's nothing to ask. - I'm not asking anything, I'm just here. It's as if I met an old phantom. Who? Federico Lego. You knew him? Then known as Ruppert von Leggaert. Give me another cigarette. Max! Calm down, Max! We've got plenty of time to talk. Soon I can visit you every day. But how should I talk? Where should I start? It's a really long story. - Max, we have time. - No. We have no time. That was all 50 years ago. It's up to you. I want you to know about it. I was young then. I was 2 years old. It all started in March 1933 in Berlin. Then he spoke about the third register. You haven't even done the exercise for the second one. Oh well, the third register is easier. Dirty Jew! Daddy! - Father! - No! No. That's a child! Look at him! The same will happen to you, you dirty Jew. No! No! Where did that come from? You used to say, you had the defect since birth. Is it not all the same? The woman. Who was she? They were friends of my parents. He was a publisher and she a singer. So pretty. You were very alike. She saved my life. And what was her name? Elsa. Elsa Wiener. Yes, Elsa and Michel Wiener. Up there. Come on! They looked after me. She helped me to learn to walk again. Come on! I became part of her life. I had only her. Hey, are you alright? - Tiring. - Come on, you can manage it. And Michel. Michel Wiener. An incredible human being! He was an idealist and advocate of good books. He spoke very seriously to me. About what we Jews and the others could expect to happen. He explained the Nazi regime to me. He spoke about the opposition and why they were being arrested. He took me everywhere with him. Herr Wiener, please! There has been so much written about it, that I ask myself, if I can really remember, or only recount what I've read. What are you doing here? Jewish pigs! Get out of here! What gives you the right? That's none of your business! Put that back! You're destroying my whole business! I was afraid and didn't want to see her again. Michel decided that Elsa and I should leave the country. And I was determined to never enter Germany again. Elsa didn't want to leave without Michel. But he said, he had to stay in order to sell his publishing company. Eventually, the two of us left. Wait, I'll look for the seats. Max, I'll entrust Elsa to you. Look after her well. Please board the train! Closing all doors! The train is now ready for departure. Please board the train! Closing all doors! Be careful on entering! Please board the train! Michel, I'll be waiting for you. Come to us soon! Yes, I'll come. I'll be waiting for you, Michel! I was very happy when we arrived in Paris. Really happy: Paris, the freedom, the streets. Fantastic! And my fear was gone. No SA, no Nazis, no burnings and no gun shots. You can't possibly imagine it. We lived in a hotel. Michel had given us a lot of money. And I swaggered around in this massive hotel. - And walk carefully. - Yes, I will. - Good afternoon, Max. - Good Afternoon. - Was she very sad? - Oh yes. She rarely went out. We heard no news from Michel. On Christmas Eve, I had to force myself to come down for dinner. She was well-dressed. And she was beautiful. Actually very beautiful. - Elsa, when is Michel…? - Psst! To you, Max. To us! Madame, what can we play for you? I'd like my son to play. Max, I want you to play for me. Play for me. Do me a favour. A Christmas present, so to speak. A Gentleman's gesture. - Are you French? - Yes. And you? - Are you travelling to Paris? - Yes. Would you like a newspaper? Thanks! Not bad, is it? That's not half-bad. You can't possibly do that! Deliver it to Elsa Wiener in Hotel D'Orient in Paris. I beg you. Elsa Wiener, Hotel D'Orient in Paris. Thanks a lot. Oh, my god! - Where can I find Madame Wiener? - Number four. Hello? - What are you doing here? - I'm looking for Madame Wiener. - Is she here? - What's up then? I've come from Berlin to deliver a message to her. - Who are you at all? - Maurice Bujart. I've just come from Berlin, young man. I'll have a look, but wait outside. That's the man from Berlin. Maurice Bujart, pleased to meet you! Sit down! Are you really Madame Wiener? Yes. I was requested to hand this over to you. Who? I don't know. He only said: Madame Wiener, Hotel D'Orient. So I called here. Are you really Elsa Wiener? - Yes. - Then take it. - Who did you get the money from? - From a man on the train. - What did he look like? - I don't really know exactly. Tall, unshaven and inconspicuously dressed. And he was wearing a cap. Michel! And suddenly he shoved the money into my bag. Why you of all people? He was looking for someone French. Then he was lead away by civilians, who never asked to see his papers. He knew that he would no longer be able to make it to the border. Just got back from Italy and find the lovely Euraly. Erato leads me there with red roses. She's my favourite muse, but only to fond. I know you don't believe me, mes chéries, but the muse in my dreams is Mussolini! I've just arrived by plane from Berlin, and I'm looking for a playmate. Whether she's blond, brunette, poor, or rich to me it's all the same. She should help me by bearing children: With a big ass, so that forever we will love our divine laps. Heil! And now, ladies and gentlemen exclusive for the first time: The renowned nightingale from Vienna, Elsa Wiener! Bravo! She's no friend of mine. Bravo! Bravo! - Can you buy me something? - No, sorry, I have to go. - Are you crazy? - Let me go. - Do you hear that? They want you. - But there's no way I can do it. They paid for four songs. Now you're going to sing. Let me be! Hey, bravo, bravo! Madame, forgive me please! - Yes? - Your singing was really fantastic. - Is that all? - This morning you were so sad. - What do you actually do in Berlin? - I sell champagne. It's a good business. May I invite you for a drink? - No, thanks. - It would distract you. Was the man on the train a friend of yours? No, that was Michel, my husband. They'll let him go if he did nothing. Everything will be OK. I work with them. They're basically nice people. They are beasts and murderers, who only fill me with hate. Whoever works with them, is a rascal. Leave me alone. Michel, wherever you may be I'll always be by your side. I love you, Michel. Elsa Wiener took care of the accused for several months, brought him up like a mother. He was deprived of nothing. He didn't live in the lap of luxury, but the basic necessities were taken care of. Would anyone like to comment on this? The attorney? Monsieur? No? Alright. Monsieur Baumstein, you can now speak. Dear President, ladies and gentlemen, members of the jury. Attorney General. I'm responsible for my own actions and have to admit that. I know that I'm guilty. I accept full responsibility for my actions. Let me first state something. I have fought against every form of terrorism. Because it's dangerous and changes nothing. Nevertheless, I shot Ruppert von Leggaert, a.k.a. Federico Lego,. I don't wish to justify my action. I only wish that you can comprehend it. Even if it contradicts what I otherwise said about the insufficiency of individual actions. My deed is a cry out. An alarm signal. Regardless of my personal reasons which lead me to the murder. If you look around, you'll recognise that dangerous powers are ruling, trying to make their race theories popular amongst the masses, the same people who submerged the world into blood and flames in 1933. I regret that my deed brought the name of Solidarity International into disrepute. It was a spontaneous action. As Leggaert stood before me, I saw young Max suffering from this old man. And his torturers! I'm guilty and not looking for any excuse for my action. But I don't wish it on any child in the world, whatever nationality or race, to experience what we had to go through. - What are you up to? - Walking. And you? I came around by chance. - Is that yours? - Yes. It's pretty, isn't it? - A Citroen? - Yes. It's one of the best. - What's your mother up to? - Madame Elsa is not my mother. She took me in. My father worked for her husband. - After the accident? - Wasn't an accident, it was the SA. - Who? - The SA! The Nazis! - What reason did they have? Because I'm a Jew. Have you met Jews before? No. To be honest: No. - Do you want a ride? - I'd love one! Is Elsa Jewish too? No, not at all. - And Michel, her husband? - He neither. He was arrested because he published books against the Nazis. - You saw him? - How do you know that? Madame Elsa told me. I saw him only very shortly. - The cinema, Monsieur Bujart? - Maurice, not Monsieur Bujart! - Gaumont-Palast? - Very good, Maurice. That's better. Ben und Jean, what about them? I think, Marcel wants to invite us. Forget it. You're going to hear from me! Is everyone here? Only the absentees are missing. Enough jokes for now. So: It can't go on like this. It's the crisis. Everything's expensive. The shows, the decorations, the taxes. The staff. And the guests don't want to drink. - Does he want to close? - Who knows? I'm considering the following: I'm very happy to hear that. Things are much easier when you can laugh. I'll close down or I'll have to let everyone go, except Jean for the piano. - Because I'm the best. - Quiet. Because you're the cheapest. That's it. Sorry. If you want to stay, you can. I could give you turnover commission. What does that mean? 20 Francs, if you get the guest to buy a drink. That's the only possibility, unfortunately. Tell me by the end of the week. At least Marcel is still a nice guy. - Others would have been real swine. - It still doesn't help Elsa very much. It'll work out. Only the start won't be easy. But later… Later we'll all be sick of it! One moment, thank you! - Good afternoon. - Hello, madam. Good afternoon, madame, do you have news? No. I have some for you. And they're good ones. - Twenty thousand. - Twenty thousand? When? Now, if you agree. I'll make a call. I think, you can get 22 grand for it. He's rich. He's a trader. He wants to give his mistress the coat. No, I want to look at that again. But not today, Herbert. 20 thousand, that's a lot! I know, Herbert. - But I say no. - You must know that yourself! Moishe, will you come here? We're done. Please state your Name, age and profession. Bujart, Maurice. 77, profession: Champagne-merchant. And Ruppert von Leggaert? What was he doing then? He was a guest in Rajah. He was a regular there. Monsieur Bujart, your testimony is crucial. You've had no contact with the accused in the last 40 years. Why not? Am I obliged to answer? That would be desirable. Once. It was 1948, I think. Max had just come from Geneva, where he had founded an insurance company. He wasn't in good form. I had taken over the champagne selling business, after the death of my father. I was then ten years older when we saw each other again. Max too. Yes, and? The boy that I knew then was a child. Now he had grown up. A man with ideas. Continue? - We had contrary opinions. - A little more specific, please. The war was over. With all its horrors. That's all Max was talking about. It was like a compulsion. Non-stop. When he said he wanted to establish the Societé International, he asked me to join. But I declined. I disagreed with him. Neither am I today. What do you mean...? Nothing. Everyone has their ideas. Hence I didn't want to be a witness. This openness honours you, Monsieur Bujart. I would like a to ask a precise question. In May of 1934, after you had taken Max and had met Elsa, Elsa asked you to go to Berlin, to make contact with her husband's lawyer. Is that right? - Yes. - Why did you do that? With all the risks, that existed at the time. I was trying to do her a favor. She was so alone. - So sad. - Out of pity, then? No. No. Elsa aroused no pity. I went to Berlin because... because I... Monsieur Bujart. Were you in love with Elsa Wiener? Yes. Yes, I was. There's nobody up there. I'd like to speak to attorney Hellwig. You know exactly that he's not here. I'd like to speak to attorney Hellwig.. I've come from France. Stop torturing me. I can't take anymore. - Arrest me if you want. - I don't understand what you mean. I've been sent by Elsa Wiener. It's about her husband Michel. She hasn't heard any news from him. I can wait for him. But tomorrow morning, I have to return to Paris. - Who are you talking about? - The attorney Hellwig. - Ah. - Is he here? Tell him: Maurice Bujart wishes to speak to him regarding Elsa Wiener. Here he is! Talk! - Say, what you want to say. - What? Attorney Hellwig is in the urn. Go on and speak. He will listen to you. I thought you were one of the Gestapo. They provoke me constantly with new methods. Kurt disappeared two months ago. I received this urn in the post. That was three weeks ago. - That's all. - Monstrous! - Who could do that? - Are you kidding? I'll tell you, dear Frenchman: The Nazis! Who do you think otherwise? That's absolutely impossible. Unbelievable! And Michel? - How is Elsa? - She's worried and very uneasy. She won't hear anything, understand? Her Michel is lost! Just as lost as Kurt. Lost like us all! - Who is Kurt? - Kurt? He was my husband. You understand nothing, Monsieur Bujart. You won't see anyone down there. Everything alright, Monsieur Bujart. Everything's normal. Nothing strange. He always said, Hitler wouldn't last more than six months. He's still here. Everything looks so clean. Just look at the streets: The cleanest in Europe! No demonstrators, trade unions, attorneys, opposition. - Everything's controlled. - You're pretty crazy. Of course, they're trying to drive me crazy. I get threatened on the street. They ring my bell and insult me. And you, sir? What do you want here? I'm selling champagne. Selling champagne… Everything is normal. And you're selling champagne. Go home, Monsieur. There's no sense in staying here. What should I tell Elsa? What should I tell her? She'll never understand it! Tell her, how you came across me. And about that. - And you? - Me? No, wait. I haven't spoken to anybody for so long. Stay. You would be doing me a big favour. Why did you not visit Michel? I'm happy to repeat it again: You can't visit anyone! Do you understand? You visited Kurt's wife. She's being watched. She's not going to last long. She's in a bad way. Berlin has changed a lot. Who cares about Berlin! You were in Berlin because of Michel. And you found out nothing about him. Not the slightest! It's impossible to find out anything, Elsa. Everyone's afraid. Michel was imprisoned by the Gestapo. You already know that. I did, what I could. I don't know, what else I could do. You promised me! - You did absolutely nothing! - I did, what I could! You should have visited him in prison. In which prison? Do you know where they put him? No? Me neither. I found the attorney in an urn. Should I maybe ask the police? Pardon, Michel Wiener, which prison? No, that's not the way. It's a lost cause… - Stop it, Elsa! Don't upset yourself. Not at all. Quite the opposite. I'm sorry. It's part of my job. To get drunk. To get others drunk. Order now, otherwise I'll move on to the next customer. If Michel dies, I'll die too. Nonsense, Elsa. I'm also here for you. And don't forget Max. No, I want Michel, nobody else! I want my Michel! If you knew him, you would understand. That's him. Think about it. As soon as possible, Frau Wiener. You can't blackmail me. I'm ashamed of you and our country. I'm in Rajah every evening. I'll talk to Maurice. Wait for me. - What did you say to him? - Nothing in particular. Go, please. He doesn't look very happy. - Five years. - What? Michel has been sentenced. Five years concentration camp. Oh my god. - Maurice, do me a favour? - Yes? Take Max for a short while. I need to be alone and think. If it helps you. - When? - Now would be the best time. I'll explain it to him. - Will he be angry with me? - Surely not. He has a better time with Maurice than mine with the nanny. Maurice has got calibre. - He helps me, that's all. - That's right. Profit from it, before it's over. Don't pull such a face. You know exactly what I'm thinking. What should I do? The poor rats have got no money. You do what you want anyway. Stop moaning. And stop getting drunk. - Did you get that? - It's none of your business. Alright, let's talk about something else. Excuse me please. - I can't do it. - For god's sake, you're an adult. - You would do it? - I don't know. I was never in love for a long time. But with someone like Michel… Who knows? Decide: This guy has been coming here daily. He'll get fed up sometime. Waiter, the bill! Hang on, it's my turn. Thanks a lot. I keep thinking about it. But I just couldn't bring myself to it. That's betraying Michel. If it were only so easy, Maurice wouldn't be half so into you. Alright, let's go. Support our campaign against Hitler. Come to the demonstration. Support our campaign against Hitler. Come to the demonstration. - Elsa, I'd prefer to go home again. - Me too. - Shit. - Can I say something, Elsa? Life is a load of shit! Attorney, if you excuse, I'd like to remind you of my case. No news from my Hector, who's been imprisoned for the last six months, and accused despite his innocence. I hope, dear attorney, than you can win the case for my Hector. I'll send you money. I would be very happy with a visitor's permit. I remain respectfully yours. Very nice! That's two Francs, Julie. - The last time you only wanted one. - Business letters are more expensive. They're harder than love letters. - You'll bring it to the post office. - Yes. - Are you coming tomorrow again? - Yes. - Max! - Elsa? - What are you doing here? - Working. Marcel doesn't know. Normally I'm here earlier, but Julie had no time. - You could have at least asked me. - Maurice knows. - Are you alright with Maurice? - It's not the same as with you. When you greet someone, you give them a kiss. Yes. Comrades, it's high time, we learnt from the events in Germany and Italy. When the worker's movement disunites, fascism profits, and then crushes the working class and all it's organisations. Let's unite our powers for the release of all victims of fascism, and at the same time, defeat the bourgeoisie in our own country. If we stand united, we can save all the freedom fighters in Germany... Speak for Michel. He's imprisoned in Germany. He's her husband. Stand up for him. Alright, come here. This is Michel Wiener's wife. - You are Michel Wiener's wife? - Yes. Stefan Werner. I know your husband. I met him once in Vienna. What can we do for you? They took him away overnight. I see. But not only him. The best thing would be for you to tell us yourself about your husband. - When? - Now, If you'd like to. Madame Wiener would like to speak. Please come, Madame. What's up? They're are so many people here. What are you waiting for? Good afternoon, Madame Wiener. I'm pleased to welcome the wife of the Berlin publisher Michel Wiener. Her husband is one of us. A few words from Madame Wiener. Michel, my husband, was always sincere, respectable. He lived for his work, the publishing of books. Heine, Goethe, Thomas Mann. They arrested him and stuck him in a camp. Do you know what it's like to be in a camp like that? I've been told, that the men are regularly maltreated there. They will kill Michel. Please do everything, so that my husband doesn't die. I plead with you! My dear! Please. Bravo! Bravo! The guy on the radio plays a lot worse than you. With filling or regular? What's up, maestro? - You were in Berlin to see Michel! - With filling or regular? Which way? Doesn't matter. You had no right to visit him without telling me. Listen, Einstein. Your starting to get on my nerves. Tell me, Max, what's going on? Let me see. My god, stop acting like that. It's nothing. I have seen Elsa. Oh, that's where the dog is buried. So go on? Damn it! Follow me, I'll take a look at your finger. Show me. Does it hurt? No. Be careful! Don't move! Move your hand a bit higher. So, there you go! What's up with Elsa? Fire away! She doesn't look good. I'm worried. She's drinking too much. - How do you know that? - I work in Rajah. - And what do you do there? - I write letters for the ladies. You could have asked me before. You're not my father. So, what do you want to do? I don't know. Not hungry, Maurice? Are you going out? My little Prince, someday I'm going to smack you. Leave me alone, I'm busy! Hello, Monsieur! - Are you looking for Elsa? - Yes. She's gone away, but she'll be back tomorrow. - Thanks. - And what should I tell her? Stupid swine! Two years, maximum three. Another three years, then I'll take over the business. Champagne Bujart. That's me now. Maurice Bujart! When there's a bad harvest, the business runs by itself. But if the harvest is good, it's stored and we wait and see. And if it's not so good, the price rises, and the people drink it nevertheless. There's not much happening, Elsa. The woman who loves me, won't have to worry about anything. - So, Elsa, how about it? - Great. I had a sleep and it did me a world of good. Could you accompany me? You swine. You swine! - You swine! - Maurice, what are doing here? Why did you do it? Why did you sleep with that swine? - Monsieur, you're drunk. - Shut up, you bastard! I have a right to an answer, Elsa! What right? Bujart in Germany. Bujart for Max. And now Elsa is tired. Bujart, friend and good mate. Elsa, have you forgotten? The Nazis are monsters and murderers. You went to bed with a monster. Don't say anything more about it, Elsa? You're a cheap whore and a murderer! It had to be done, Maurice. Michel will be free! No letters for me? No phone calls, no letters, nothing? Oh, there's a telegram. It's been lying here for three days. Now you'll have to go. Michel is free now, just because Elsa was in bed with Ruppert von Leggaert. Michel! Michel! Oh, Michel! My Michel! - Who informed you? - The Red Cross. Michel! Michel! We have a room, right near here. Just for us. Come on! I have to take care of something first. - Why immediately? - I have to meet friends. Comrades. What kind of comrades? Michel, you've just been released! Sure. I'm free, but not the others. They're all still there. I've got a lot to report to the newspapers. So that the whole world knows… Is it much further? No. I know my way around here. - Michel! - Yes? Was it really bad? You must be fluent in French now, are you? It was just like you said. When they came to get me, I thought to myself: You're going to be shot! And now I'm here! And what's Max doing? You'll hardly recognise him. He's big now. You'll see for yourself. - You kept him? - Yes. I said to myself: If I keep him, Michel will come back. And now you see: I'm here! A true miracle! Michel. Michel! I thought about you constantly. To survive, I spoke to you. I made you laugh, and you laughed. Finally, we're together again. What did you do? Who managed to get me released? Who? It was me, Michel. Who else? Michel! Bailiff, please send in the next witnesses. Madame Mopart! Please speak into the microphone, Madame. Please state your name, age, profession and address. Mopart, Charlotte. 77. Retired. I live in Paris in the 18th district. Did you know the accused before the act? Are you related to him in any form? No. Do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth? Yes. Raise your right hand and say: I swear! I swear! Madame Mopart, what befell you after the death of the Wieners? The situation was extremely difficult. For Max, it was as if he'd lost his parents for the second time. He often went to the cemetery. Then we spoke to each other. Maurice and I. He decided to take the boy to some friends in Switzerland. He was a great chap, good old Monsieur Bujart. That has to be said. Madame, are you finished? Just a moment, please, dear President. I'd like Madame Mopart to tell us what caused her, to busy herself again with Michel and Elsa Wiener. After my release from the camp in 1945… - Camp? - Yes, I was arrested in '43. You know, after I returned from the camp I wanted to lay flowers at the grave. Elsa was my friend. But I found no grave. Nazi-collaborators put both of them in one grave. I wanted to do something, so that they were not simply forgotten. I organised a collection. For a memorial plaque at Café Sans Souci. But that also met with opposition. German resistance fighters! But what's that supposed to mean? They were the first ones to challenge Hitler. Objection! That has nothing to do with the case. I'd like to point out that this witness, who's so concerned with morals, was a smuggler in Pigalle for 20 years. What has that got to do with anything? - May I go now? - Yes, Madame. Normally those swine die well looked after in bed. At least we got one of them. One bastard less. That's worth living to see. Bravo, Max! Lina, five years with probation. That was for your Jews, you slut. He won't enter paradise. That can't be true! Do I get an answer, or not? Of course, pure coincidence, that I look like Elsa. Paris is still a wonderful city. If I were a jury member, you'd have gotten no probation. What kind of a person was she? Who? Elsa! She was like you, a nag. Why did you never mention her? Why should I? You would have asked the same things. When I met you, I couldn't believe my eyes. Please, the trial is over. - You've hardly any hair left. - Well. That comes with time. 6 months later, Lina und Max Baumstein were shot in front of their house. The rest is alright. Nobody admitted responsibility for the murders. The perpetrators were never detected. Let's go! Waiter, please. - Are you paying? - Yes. - 46,80, please. - Keep the change. Thanks! Monsieur, excuse me please, - are you Max Baumstein? - Yes, why? I just wanted to shake your hand. Come on! I love you! I love you like an old fool. I'm crazy in love with you. Subtitles: Neil Hennessy GALILEO MEDIEN AG / Berlin
