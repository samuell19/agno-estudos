THE SECRET OF STEEL CITY BASED ON THE NOVEL BY JULES VERNE At the end of the last century, the whole world was excited by an inheritance of half a billion francs. The inheritance was divided between two heirs. And both were allowed to realize their life's plan. Doctor of medical sciences Francois Sarrasin built a modern city for 50,000 inhabitants and called it Fortuna. Professor of chemistry Eric Janus built factories in his city, which soon became known as Steel City. 15 years later, an unknown man tried to flee from Steel City and swim across the border river. Stop! - The Black Frost... - What? The Black Frost. The Black Frost. Give up! Run! Janus is going to destroy you! Death! A Black Frost? Do you really want to spread rumors of a poor man in shock to the journalists? Of course not, that's why I've brought you here. How could he come by fresh frostbite? Now, in summer? Janus has been making experiments with an artillery grenade which freezes the surroundings of the explosion. - How did you find out? - From Garmond. He is Janus' close co-worker. He is an engineer like you, he himself contacted me. The raw materials have been depleted in their territory. But there is enough iron and copper under our feet. That's why Janus has decided to take Fortuna City by force. What kind of a weapon is it? The last information is one year old. Fortuna City is at stake and you have waited a whole year! Was I supposed to write them a letter? Do you think they've arrested him? Perhaps they have just kept an eye on him. - Or Janus paid him more. - You would be judging him unfairly. Garmond can't be bought. Gentlemen, therefore I would like to strongly appeal to the world's conscience. Janus had already threatened years ago that he would occupy Fortuna City. And now the danger is concrete. Nobody uses the expression "Black Frost" nowadays. Only perhaps on the weather forecast. What did he mean by this? That poor man won't answer your question. Ask Professor Janus. The readers of your newspaper should learn what he produces in his Steel City. And that he is improving his machines constantly. Customers are well informed about the quality of his products. Not goods, but inventions. Brilliant as well as dangerous, Count. - And not just for us. - Do you seriously believe that the world would allow anyone to destroy your beautiful city? Besides, you are his only relative. A distant relative, when I die, Janus will inherit Fortuna City. And vice versa. - Yes. - Don't worry. Gentlemen, there is world public opinion, And the International Court. Sir, I heard you are going to attend the Urban Congress in Venice. Yes, I'm leaving tomorrow. Teach them a lesson about Fortuna City, what a modern city should look like. Good luck, gentlemen. You've not canceled the safety rule about reds flag yet? Where should I still look, for fresh runners? Good bye. - Good luck. - Watch out! Watch out! Watch out, clear the way! Watch out, clear the way! Watch out, clear the way! - Six! - Show me! - Again? Go to bed, daddy must get up early. - No, grandpa, please! - You have to go, good night, - Come, princess. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night, daddy. - Go with your mommy. - Good night. - Good night. Dad, will you be sending us stamps and postcards? Of course, I will. - Go to your Mommy, good night. - Good night. I'll take care of the postcards. But you can still refuse it, Marcel. You have a family, but you are the only one I've ever confided in. Yes. But it's not just my family, who live here. The entire city is in a danger; the city you allowed me to build based on my project. Viktor Garmond is in his room; please. We worry about him, we caught him at the train station a week ago. He was asking people when the train was going to Steel City. Now we are careful. As you can see, the boys are practising the retention of a deserter. They are improving their perception and courage. It is a useful game. Please. - What's over there? - A boarding school. When the engineer's wife passed away four years ago, he had to place his son there. He used to visit him there once a month and he would send a message to us on each occasion. In a bottle. But as you know, nothing has come for a whole year. What's his son's name? Viktor, your father will soon be released from the hospital. You have been telling me this for 11 months and 2 days, I won't play this game anymore. A few drops of nitroglycerin can make a big mess, you know that. First they did plastic surgery, then he was depressed. Either you allow me to see him, or I'm gonna run away. You must have patience. Why doesn't he write me at least? Does he still have bandages on his hands? Come on! Another man in his shoes would have given it up long ago. And he talks about you all the time, trust me. - Viktor, he has no one but you. - And do I have anyone? Suppose you're already in Steel City. And then what? I'll find the inn closest to the works office. I'll wait there until a man with the same bandage on his left hand appears. That is the only way to meet engineer Garmond. Asking about him would be too dangerous. And remember: if the meeting is not realized, I'll send a boat for you on the third day at midnight and I'll wait for you here. Listen, haven't you come across... the man who used to meet your father here? They say he used to visit your villa in Steel City. Since my mother died, nobody has come to see us. Just remember. - Come on! - He didn't talk to anyone here. Don't play with it! What did he look like? This key is from your suitcase? - I have to go. - What else did my father say? You should behave nicely and not run away from boarding school. And he said: "I'll take little Vicky home for the Christmas holiday." Did he really say that? Little Vicky? Yes, he did. He feels sorry that you had to stay here alone for the whole holidays. I am tired of it all, I lost a whole year with that assignment. Do you know what that means for a designer? We need to get the messenger. And he has to be alive, he has to speak, as proof. Should I wait another year in Garmond's villa in case they send someone from Fortuna City? A few days more, Mr Moltke. We have to imitate Garmond's handwriting, to keep the boy quiet. Then we will arrange for you to be transferred to the engineering department. Which pay category? You won't be out of pocket. Are you coming from the harbor? Not every foreigner comes to us with honest intentions. How do you know I am a foreigner? You gave two soldi to the musicians, that is not a habit here. - The musician is not blind? - Yes, he is. But the little girl isn't. - I'm sorry, Mr. Anderson. - Light injury from the ship. In one week I will be able to start work. Experienced metal workers are always needed here. I'll fill in your mandatory application form. - Is this a police station? - For workers. - Done. - Thank you. What is that mountain? Cyclops Hill, the manganese used to be mined there. Why? -It must have a beautiful view. - It's a restricted area. But don't worry, once you start working, you won't have much time for trips. You won't complain about the lack of work, Mr. Anderson. If you're looking for accommodation, my uncle owns an Inn 10 minutes from here. You are very kind, but I'm starving already. Thank you. Now he's already on the train to Marseille. Tomorrow he will be in Venice. The moon will shine on the sea beneath the hotel window... Singing gondoliers.... It's a pity I'm not with him. Thank you. Here you go, Oskar. I told you a long time ago and you still do not want to believe me. - Hello, buddy! - Oh no! There is your beer... - Didn't you notice the sign? - What sign? Whoa! If the foreman had let me know in time, it wouldn't have exploded in my hands! Come on! He sent you because he doesn't want to pay! How much did he give you for the stakeout? Take off the rag! I bet his hand is healthy! Stop! Come here! Hey, buddy, come and have a drink! Look out! Run! Run away! Run! Move! Stay back! Stay back! Move! The Black Frost! The Black Frost! Move back! Move back! Disperse! Carbon dioxide is a bastard. He was not as lucky as the others last month. They only got it on their legs. Move back! Move back! He won't come, it's dawn. I am a friend of engineer Garmond. He asked me to accompany his son to their home. I am sorry, but this is not possible. Today he has run away again. - Did he leave by train? - You can wait here. The train will arrive at 2 o'clock. - The train staff have been alerted. - You know what? Let him go this time, I'll take care of him. Your tickets, please. Thank you. Your ticket, please. Thank you. You promised me never to run away again! Are you living here? I've just come for a few things your father needs. Actually, me too. When will you bring him back from the hospital? Today? Or tomorrow? I will wait for him here. What shall we do with him? Now it is your problem, I've lost a whole year. - The whole thing ends for me. - I see. A pleasure on both sides, I would say. I'll see you tomorrow, we'll pick you up in the morning. I can find the way to the inner sector on my own. They won't let you into the special department without our escort. Good night. I'll call the police to take the boy away. He can't stay here, I have my orders. Engineer Garmond? Hurry up, I've been waiting for you at the inn for three days already. My name is Marcel. You didn't expected anyone from Fortuna to appear, right? Where's your son? By morning we must be beyond the boundary river. Calm down, you don't have to worry about that man outside. How far is Janus with the thing? What? In the last report you said he wanted to destroy Fortuna City with his secret weapon. Why hasn't he done it yet? That is good for you, right? Do you think he manages everything as he wishes? I was supposed to return to Fortuna yesterday. But I accidentally witnessed the crash of the missile. Caliber over 600mm. It was just a leak of carbon dioxide, but I can imagine what it could do in an explosion. Therefore I ask you, is this the secret weapon? And if so, why is the missile so big? And if it's so big, what is going to fire it? Is it possible to construct a cannon from which you could fire it? Nothing is impossible for Janus. So you admit it? For God's sake, couldn't you let us know? So we can get ready? You know we don't have a permanent army. It was not possible! - They let you see your son, didn't they? - But they kept an eye on me. There are other ways. Or were you afraid, Garmond? Do you see what the key is from? These are my things! And do you know where it was hidden? - Get back there immediately! - My father never sent you for me! And you are stealing our silver kitchenware! Shut up, you little oaf! You've been lying to me for a whole year, Mr. Moltke! Stop! You made a mistake, huh? Engineer Garmond has been dead for a year. He died during the test? He shouldn't have shot at me. Hands up! Search him, move! He's a spy from Fortuna City. They should be blamed for your father's death. Is it true? Are you still interested in the cannon? It already exists. When Janus shoots from this cannon, Fortuna City will be destroyed. From the border river to Fortuna City... It would have to have a range of 20 miles. I've already told you that nothing is impossible for Janus. And where does he keep it? In a moment you will have the chance to ask someone else. Such a monster cannot be masked. You bastard! Run, boy! Let me go! They killed my daddy! - They killed my daddy! - Boy... Listen... we have to go! Go, pack your things. - It is broken. - They'll fix it in Fortuna City. Thank you. You're a good boy. If it wasn't for you, I couldn't have handled it. Professor Janus wants to destroy Fortuna City. He needs our natural raw materials. When he gets it all, he's going to destroy everything. And your father did not agree with that. That's why he helped us. What did they do with him? He probably resisted arrest. We'll probably never know how it really happened. How did you find out he was lying to you? According to my father's message. He allegedly said: "I'll take little Vicky home for the Christmas holiday." My daddy never called me that. And he didn't know what the key is from. And he didn't know we had a hiding place here with my daddy. Now it is perfect. - What did your father call you? - Vick. What am I supposed to call you? Hide yourself! Mr. Moltke! Mr. Moltke! Mr. Moltke? Mr. Moltke? Where have you been? I was fighting for my life and you hung around! Are you alright? I heard shooting. Don't you see it? Go after him! - We need to give his description! - I was... - Go! - We need to give his description! One adult and one child's ticket. Six. The press conference is being held in the green lounge, sir. It is said that Professor Janus runs the city on his own. Is that true? He concentrated the ideal of centralization in himself. The Ruler, the Supreme Judge and the Army Commander in one person. He even approved this train timetable. What would happen if he died suddenly? God forbid! No one would work in Steel City tomorrow. They wouldn't know what to do, nor would they be allowed to. Please. We have invited the entire world press to the Conference. Where are you going? - I am returning the boy to boarding school. - He knows the way. What if he escapes again? I'm only carrying out my orders, engineer. You are coming with me. We just do what you have been asking for. It's no longer my business. I can say goodbye to him, can't I? I don't want to go to boarding school! Don't worry, nothing will happen to you. I told the principal that your dad wants to talk to you. Release it during the ride. And hold on, I'll be back for you. And thank you, Vick. This is the last time you'll escape, do you understand?! You act as if you don't know what we always do. Captain, the special squad is ready! Release him! Gentlemen, let me introduce you to a new colleague, engineer Moltke. Come. I am sorry, but we have our instructions, the regulations are fixed. Good luck to you, engineer. Attention, please! Professor Janus has a special interest in this new task. The result will determine, who becomes the professor's personal constructor. Go ahead. Here you are. This task may be slightly difficult for you, Moltke. - Am I right? - We'll see. I can try, right? How do you like your new workplace? This drawing board is important for me. I don't care about the room. We are in a special department of the inner sector. There are twenty meters of granite above us. Dormitory, dining room, everything underground. That's how it's a secret. You are going to stay with engineer Wigan. I'm used to being alone. "Sabotage by Spies from Fortuna City," "A gas tank explosion," "Victims dead..." "The patience of Steel City is not infinite." They are looking for a pretext. What does Count Hulshof write about it? He has been the only one not to believe Janus so far. You mustn't get angry, dad. - Would you like some more tea? - No, thank you. Oskar! You've brought me a message, haven't you? Service! The Commander of the militia, please. Grandpa! Dad wrote to us! - Look, the first letter from Marcel. - How is he doing? I wasn't seasick, it is beautiful here, the Congress begins tomorrow, kisses, Marcel. William? Sarrasin speaking, the situation is serious. Call the city council at 13:00. Telegraph to Hulshof. Confirm! I don't think that your father praised you for this. Did you talk to him? I've never seen that friend of his before. He wasn't my father's friend. He was the one who keep visiting him. Your father's position was, and still is, important to the city. How is he doing? He got worse, they didn't let me visit him. It will be alright, boy. Chin up, everything will be fine. I will have to punish you for your next escape. Do you understand? Fortuna City is digging trenches on the opposite bank. What? Go immediately to the telegraph! Request orders from Steel City! Wait! And prepare to evacuate the boarding school! - A fine silk, please. - Sure. For one or two shirts? - Give me it all. - Certainly. I heard Professor Janus likes his colleagues to be well dressed. There you go. Welcome, engineer Moltke. Pleased to meet you, finally. I am obliged to you for having revealed the double agent engineer Garmond. I can appreciate your harshness and determination. Although it is a pity that Garmond is gone. He was an excellent chemist. It seems to me you started to watch him when he began to be successful at work. You may have envied him. We should have offered him more money. It is not good to negotiate with traitors. Straight solutions are not always the best ones. You do not choose them either. And that's why you are successful. I'll get you! Janus has began to build a long-range cannon on Cyclops Hill, he wants to attack Fortuna City. The destructive power of the missile is supposed to be shot at the capital. Prepare the evacuation of people into the mountains. If possible, I will add more information next time. Eng. Viktor Garmond. You know, I have been interested in long-range firing for a long time. How far do you think it will shoot? About six miles? Do I exaggerate? Eleven, for now. Imagine a city. Suddenly, in the middle of a winter night, death falls to 50,000 sleeping people. Isn't it fantastic, Mr. Moltke? A death that seems to come from the Moon. You have the best solution for the gases returning during firing. That's surprising. The way you eliminate pressures... here and here, for instance... Congratulations. We actually had bad luck. To lose a year waiting for an agent from Fortuna City, and in the end to let him escape. Am I to be blamed for the incompetence of Secret Surveillance? I don't blame you. Quite the reverse, I'm very glad to have you near me at all times. The Professor said this literally: "My soldier's feet will not cross the border river" "and won't enter Fortuna City.'' Who will guarantee us that Janus will keep his promise? Our newspaper is published in five languages. It is as if he promised it to the whole world. Why do you want to continue creating a tense situation at the border? We gave home to thousands of people. Do you wonder they want to defend it? I warn you. Either you call off the militia from the border river, or you'll lose all sympathy. Doctor... If you disregard your enemies, you should listen to advice from a friend. I have made six journeys from you to Steel City and back in a fortnight. That's over 700 miles. I can't even hold the wheel; why should I do it if not for you? Thank you, Count. Give me the Commander of the militia. William? Cancel the alert. Yes, I'll explain it to you, let all militia, except patrols, return to Fortuna City. The world public will appreciate your initiative. Why don't you get some rest? I can take one more trip to Steel City. By technical progress to permanent disability. Where am I supposed to get fresh runners every time? Why aren't you sleeping yet? - I need to... - Go. What the... Alert! Alert! Alert! Take over the railway station! Hey, boy! Do you want to earn five soldi? I'll give you ten soldi! Wait! Twenty! The new option of a back-pressure distributor. Go on! May I? Tomorrow's order for the foundries. - Go on. - Iron ore mine Samiel has been exhausted. Where am I supposed to send the miners ? Dismiss them. But you said you wanted to open new ore sources after the New Year. And I'll do that, Captain, but I won't feed the miners until then. Go on! Here you are. Arrange Christmas gifts for widows whose husbands froze to death because of the gas missile crash. - Go on! - There. - Passwords for tomorrow. - Go on! Hold on, boy! Just a little more and then you'll get some rest. Why such modesty, engineer? Your original solution was more spirited. The range barely doubled by enlarging. This doesn't solve the problem. What if I use gun-cotton instead of gunpowder mixed with 80% potassium nitrate? The pressure will be 5 times greater and the firing range will be longer too. But the barrel will smash to pieces. We have to do it differently. I'm bringing peace to you, professor! Excuse me. Congratulations, Count. I've just succeeded in convincing Doctor Sarrasin. I broke the world record for 25 miles. Let them take care of my runners and especially of this brave boy. He needs milk, honey, fruit... and new shoes. Give the boy a room on my floor. Well, engineer, don't you want to stop? For today. Vick! How did you get into the internal sector? I've got something here. It was hidden in daddy's watch. What shall we do? Everything possible to stop the canon shooting missiles from Cyclops Hill. Two, three, one, five. If you're looking for the cannon for that missile, then you're standing in its barrel. Firing range 60 miles. It's aiming straight at Fortuna City, but don't worry, the barrel is built into the bedrock, so it won't smash. Do you recognize your project, engineer Zodiak? I knew it right after the exam. Moltke would never have come up with such a thing. You won't destroy Fortuna City with a single shot! Do you think so? 100 smaller missiles in this big one will fly in all directions and contaminate the surroundings with carbon dioxide. The temperature will drop to a hundred degrees below zero. Just like on the surface of the Moon. Do you remember what I said about death coming from the Moon? This weapon won't kill by the its strength of explosion. Not at all, buildings will remain undamaged. But nobody escapes alive. The gas will find them everywhere. All the people will suffocate and freeze to death. The impact of my missile won't be just partial! In six weeks, the last day of the year, on the stroke of midnight... the inhabitants of Fortuna City will disappear from the face of the Earth. There'll be no wounded nor crippled, only the dead. In this aspect my weapon is moral. You made a commitment to the whole world! I made a commitment, that my soldiers' feet won't set foot in Fortuna City. I will keep my promise. The soldiers won't be needed. The intact houses will serve as quarters for my workers at mines which I will open near Fortuna City. There is enough copper and iron for my weapons industry for 50 years. What did you get from it? Parks and fountains. Public welfare. What a ridiculous purpose. What will you say to the world? If someone dares ask me the reasons for my attack, then you and little Garmond will be the proof of Fortuna's perfidy. You will have an opportunity to explain, why you didn't bury Moltke's corpse deeper. You've decided to remain silent. But you will be more useful for me when you start to talk. We have enough evidence against you, engineer Zodiak. They hold a meeting in a different town every week. Don't you envy him? If only those beautiful cities hadn't made him forget our Fortuna. Fortuna is the most beautiful city for Marcel, because here he has Johanka, Tom? and you, Alice. - Where is the wind blowing from today? - From the north. No, from the northwest. Tell me, when the wind blows from the south. What a balloon it will be. We have no more pigeons, yet, we need to warn Fortuna City. What if the wind doesn't turn? Natural laws are always valid, even if one is dragged down. You must trust to nature. And what if the balloon misses Fortuna City? Or it is caught in a tree? What if I fly? You? Marcel... - Absolutely not. - Marcel... It is dangerous. Write, Captain. Although Fortuna City's government has emphasized its peaceable nature, they have continuously been sending spies to Steel City. As soon as we succeeded in discovering engineer Viktor Garmond, he has been replaced by the designer of Fortuna City, engineer Marcel Zodiak. If the journalists wish, he could be brought to them. He certainly will not deny he has committed murder and under the name of his victim has ingratiated himself into my favour with the intention to kill me. - Have you got it, Captain? - Yes. You will present this report to all press agencies tomorrow, 31 December, at 20.00. Marcel! Can you hear me? Marcel! The south wind is blowing. What? May the wind last for 6 hours at least. What's wrong with you? Have we forgotten something? The balloons are all right. You are worried about me, aren't you? Don't be. I'm going to make it. Everybody must escape into the mountains. - Do you understand? Without personal things. When you are above Fortuna City, pull it. - Are you worried? - I'm worried about you. What will they do to you, when they find me gone? We have 18 hours to rescue the city. So... Everyone must leave the city by midnight before the New Year. And say hello to everyone! The security zone is intact. He couldn't have escaped from the inner sector. Launch a hunt for him over the whole territory. And declare a reward for his capture. Aren't you going to tell us? Think it over. Even if he succeeded in escaping, he can't manage to warn Fortuna City. They shot down a balloon with a boy near the river 3 hours ago. - What happened to him? - It's not in the telegram. You can be satisfied, you did what you could. I declare a combat alert to the army. Ensure army movement near the border river, close the borders, wait for further orders. Yes, sir! The suit! Do it! Have you also sent my statement to the Consideration newspaper? Yes, I have. Where is Count Hulshof now? He spends the last day of the year in Fortuna City. All the better. Cannon charged, sir, should we close the barrel? - Increase the charge! - But the calculations... I said, increase the charge by 20 percent! Yes, sir! Increase the charge by 20 percent! Please... Dr Sarrasin... where will I find him? - The charge has been increased! - Close the barrel! Close the barrel! - Where is Dr Sarrasin? - Are you looking for my grandpa? Where is Dr Sarrasin? - Remove the cover of the barrel! - Right, sir! Boy, you've got a fever. - Are you Dr Sarrasin? - Yes, I am. This is for you. Everyone must leave the city by midnight. Too late. Gentlemen, to the human genius. To world domination! Get ready! Five, four, three, two, one... - Papa, where are you? - Grandpa! Happy new year! Steel City has been quiet for a week! Steel City hasn't responded for five days! There isn't any news coming from Steel City. Steel City is quiet! - Where is Professor Janus? - Nobody knows, sir. His orders stopped coming since the New Year. No one has been working for the past week. And what about the army? The soldiers searched the whole palace but didn't find anyone. Then they plundered the shops and ran away. Nobody knows what to do. Marcel! Marcel! Marcel! Marcel told me, that this door can be opened by the clock. - A numerical code! - What time is it? - It's midday! - But the exact time! - It's 11:48. One, one, four, eight. Nothing. Wait a minute. Viktor, set the code to 2-4-0-0. Two, four, zero, zero. It works! Marcel... Give me my bag, hurry! Marcel... They froze to death. They probably overloaded the charge and the missile was torn apart. His own megalomania destroyed him. Such a scientist, an organizer, a talent. What was it all for? You have become the owner of Steel City. All the factories are yours, do you realize that, Doctor? Yes, I do, but Marcel must operate them to make something more useful there. They're already waiting for you at home, aren't they? They're waiting for us, Vick. For you and me. Let's go. Dedicated to the memory of Jules Verne, who knew and anticipated many things.
