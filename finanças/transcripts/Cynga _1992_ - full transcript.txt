He must be here somewhere. Andrzej! Andrzej! Come quickly! “He will help you. Don’t go out without leaving a message where you are and when you’ll be back. Think about us and remember that we are trying to find you. Trust in God, Mother". There is no safe route from Warsaw to Lvov now. The Soviets are in Lvov. But if you insist... I have documents here of a soldier who died at the beginning of the war. He even looks like you. Glazewski, Jozef. Date of birth, 3 November 1918. Place of birth: Lodz. You'll be transfered to a forester's lodge near the border. There you will wait for a suitable occasion, and then... SPRING 1940 General, Sir! Stop with that goddamn "General, Sir"! Please. There are many people in your place. I don’t know. Since they’ve set up the Soviet border here, it's better not to ask. Got you, you little thief! Got you! - What did I steal from you? - My peace. Now I’ll steal something from you. I’d like to stay with you. Then stay. You won’t regret it. Will you tell me your name now? And will you tell me where are you going? I can’t. Secrets. - What’s your real name? - I have to forget. - Why? - For my own good. Well, for some time anyway. Careful, the border! Stop! Or I’ll shoot! What’s that? - Well? - Got him. The street remembers Mr Beck. He was so agile! - Your name? - Jozef Glazewski. The son of Grzegorz and Genowefa. Born on 3 November 1918 in Lodz, to a working-class family. Why did you cross the border illegally? To find my family. - Where? - In Lvov. Address? The trouble is, I don't know. You're going to your family and you don't know the address? Apparently, they stopped in Lvov, but where, I don't know. Show us your hands. - All clear. - Yes. A spy. - Sign the statement. - I'm not signing anything. I’m innocent. Who are you? I? Nobody. But you... Did you recognise me? But I didn't do anything. If you have a clear conscience, speak the truth and nothing but the truth. After all, it is right here and right now, that the truth wins. "Its colour is the deepest red, For it, the workers' blood was shed, For it, the workers' blood was shed". I was lying. My name is Andrzej Klonowicz. I live in Warsaw. My father was a teacher. I had to leave Warsaw... Come on, I know Polish documents well. That’s the truth! My parents and I got lost at the beginning of the war. Now I'm going to Lvov, to find them. - You’re lying! - Really. Have you ever been abroad? Once, in Paris on a school trip. - Do you know anyone in France? - No one. Name? Enough! - Name? - Glazewski... Mother’s name? - I don’t know. - Enough! - Speak the truth! - The truth! - The truth! - The truth! - Speak the truth! - The truth! - The truth! - The truth! What a fool! Come on, boy, sign it. I am innocent. I won’t sign anything. "So, comrades, come rally, And the last fight let us face, The Internationale unites the human race". They don’t want to listen to me. They think I am a provocateur. They think... that I want to infiltrate our workers movement... and destroy it treacherously from the inside. Very vigilant comrades. This number with the truth did not work out for me. What number?! Well, cheer up. Wanda Wasilewska is in Lvov already. She is very concerned about the fate of Poles. "Of the past let us cleanse the tables, Mass enslaved, fling back the call!" I haven't said everything. I... Well? I wanted to get in touch with Wanda Wasilewska. Who is that? A writer. She’s a communist activist. How were you supposed to contact her? Normally. Apparently, she’s here, in Lvov. Who did you want to ask about her? It doesn’t matter. Even you. You crossed the border illegally, to come to us and ask about this Wanda Wasilewska? How did you meet? At her lecture. I asked her to explain something to me. What was it? It was something about love. About love? What love? A liberated love. And what is that? Well, it means... for a woman not to be oppressed by a man. Did you sleep with her? What do you mean “sleep”? Well, normally, in bed. Once. Maybe twice. - And how was it? - I'm sure it was good. Go on, speak! Speak, boy, don’t be ashamed. Be a man! Good. What was she like? She had black hair, large, almond shape eyes, shapely body. What’s that shit you’ve been feeding us with for weeks? You think we don’t know who you are? We have undisputable evidence that you are a spy and you’ll either confess to everything, or you’ll be sentenced to death. What about Wasilewska? Sign it. No. I won’t sign anything. I’m innocent. Come on out, go on! Keep going! This is your last chance to confess. I'm counting to three. One, two, three. Your time is up. It doesn't matter. It will pass. The comrades are very busy now. So many things. One could go crazy. Well, indeed. Had they really suspected you of espionage you would have been sitting in Lubyanka a long time ago. - Are they releasing you already? - Not yet. But Wasilewska is acting already. She went to Comrade Stalin... Well, see... Thanks to her, I'm being transferred to a temporary cell. Right... Take care! That’s not nice. Naughty boy! To talk about such things. Naughty boy! Who are you? Poor boy. He talks about me all the time, but he doesn't recognize me. I’m Wanda Wasilewska. And you will help me, right? There’s nothing to be afraid of. Everything will be all right. This is just a game. It’s like playing open cards. This can be learned. And keep winning. Tomorrow... tomorrow everything will change. The Secret Martial Court found Jozef Glazewski to be a particularly dangerous enemy of the Soviet people who, during the war in Europe, performed tasks for a foreign state and started their implementation. Therefore, the court sentences the above-mentioned person to the highest penalty, the penalty of death. The sentence will be executed immediately. Do you want to say anything? No, what for? After all, it's all fiction. This is fiction, just like your communism. You know what, you're not there. It’s dust. Just dust. You are not there. I shit on all of it. I shit on you, shit, shit, shit! Bloody bastards! Nice singing. Why did you stop? I’m innocent! No! No! Let go of me! Let go!!! No! No!!! No! No! No! No! No!!! No!!! No!!! No! No! No! The whole of Lvov is asking about us. The ruling of the Secret Military Court has been changed from the death penalty to a 5-year stay in a correctional labour camp. Sign it. Off the record, who is it? This? Caruso. Sign it. - What is it? - Nothing important. Just a formality. It confirms your Soviet citizenship. I don't want to change my citizenship. Are you in the territory of the Soviet Union or not? In that case, your citizenship is obvious. You must understand that I’m a Pole and I cannot accept a foreign citizenship. But this would be better for you. Through this one signature you will become a full citizen of our country. You will be a free, liberated citizen of the world's only state... of social justice. I won’t sign anything. I’m innocent. Sign it. No. And I’m telling you that you will sign. No. AUTUMN 1940 You scum! Get up! Wake up! You must wake up! Go to the hospital! Thirty. Thirty. Go! Move! - Check it. - Go on, check! Twenty. - Wait! - What’s with you? "Prisoners are allowed not to work outside in temperatures below -20°C". Teresa! It’s your business who you sleep with, but come to work on time. Come here! Have you gone mad? What are you doing here? Understand me. I'm afraid I won't be able to stand it. I won't make it through this day. Instead of going to the hospital, you’ll end up in the hole. But listen, I... The boss took all the places. Shit! I’ll go to see him. Have you gone nuts?! Have your head examined! I will go. I will. A convict eagerly returns home... - Goodbye. - but leaves a piece of his heart here. Boss, couldn't you give us some work indoors? My people have been felling a month... They die like flies at this time of the year. You’re always the same. Boss this, Boss that... I am not God and cannot please everyone. Come tomorrow. We'll see what can be done. What’s this? A ghost? Bloody hell! I want to go to the hospital. Go to the paramedic. Ask him. I know you took all the beds in the hospital. You know nothing, you skunk. Did you come to provoke decent people? No! Who is he to do something for him? Do you have anything of value? Can you make something for sale? I’m ill. That means weak... My boy, the weak ones must die. Such is the order of things. Eventually, anyone would fall ill and mankind would perish. That’s it. In a decent place there is no room for thieves. Faster, faster! Move! Prisoners! Listen! A step to the left, a step to the right – and I’ll shoot! Listen to me! Nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen. Jozef! Jozef! Teresa, come here. Listen, you have to help me. My buddy is lying there with those... Is he your lover that you care so much? What?! Are you crazy? He’s a Pole. Yeah, countrymen. He won't get to the hospital. You know it yourself. Think of something. Please. Maybe Czajkowski, huh? Carefully, carefully... Go! Go now... What’s that? This one to the dying barrack. He’ll get better. I know him well. Look... He is new. - Go away! - What? All right. Still, he should be examined. Why? It’s an interesting case. It’s all clear. The diagnosis – a corpse. I’m not sure about that. Well, I am. You say it's a corpse because you don't know what disease it is. And you do? Doctor Czajkowski would know. Czajkowski has no say here. He would know. I know it as well. Here is written how to treat and recognize diseases. Black on white. And so far... this is the only medical textbook here. In Chinese. Doctor Czajkowski would be glad. Yes. He would be glad. The sick are not for the pleasure of doctors. An interesting case means a lot of trouble. Bitches... Pi! Pi! Take this corpse to the madhouse! He is not dead. He's just exhausted. Go on. We thought that's an interesting case for you. Speak Russian. Nobody can hear us. What’s wrong with him? It’s scurvy. He’s a Pole. Osipow says he’s a corpse and not worth taking care of. Will you save him? Half a potato three times a day. To start with. It’s ok. In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Here, Comrades. Go on. Please, go on. He’s coming! Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! I’ll show him! Bandit! I’ll show him! I’ll show him! Thief! Maybe one of you, Citizens, has got some paper? This is our settlement, Comrades. The mystery of life. Thief! Thief! Pin Kim! What idiot let this fool out? Thief! Look how fat he got with our parcels! He sells our parcels, and then he hangs out with whores... With whores... though he’s got a daughter and a wife! Let go! Let go! Wait, you bastard... I’m coming! Doctor, I dare submit to the High Commission... Here you have to wear a gown. The register? The register! Smile. I wanted to visit you for a long time, and I took the chance of this regional inspection. Thank you for remembering about us. I can see by your face that not everything is fine... It’s the wrong moment. The patients are very excited... Don't you have the rule here that the master’s eye makes the horse fat? The Soviet power is like one’s own mother. Yes. Indeed. If you could kindly put your weapons away, it would be safer. Comrades, this is the hospital. Take it. This is the only psychiatric ward within a radius of 1,500 km. Just think! This is how the people's government cares about our region. And the cost of it... No point in talking. Comrade Prosecutor... - I'm not a prosecutor. - I came to the USSR from Germany at the invitation of your government to modernize the Soviet industry... Engineer Giekier, Doctor of Technical Sciences. As a man of science, I was proud... Bloody life! Just look... An intelligent man - and what? Please, go on. In 1930, through a stupid and unproven mistake... Be silent! I was accused of destroying the young Soviet state by introducing capitalist production methods. A miracle of nature. Catatonia. He’s in a coma. I'm telling you son, you can't support the family this way. A shopkeeper from near Lvov. You can’t feed your family by harming others. Old boy, I’m not your son. You renounced your loved ones. He’s a madman, he takes me for someone else. Camp psychosis. You don't think I’d keep my own father in the camp, do you? Who are the others? Szydel, colonel. Linfrent, folk musician from Ukraine. Dubosarski, Lenin’s employee. Godow, artist painter. Riepin, dentist. And many, many others. God... Silence! Be forever cursed! Give me the weapon! I’ll kill the son of a bitch! Give me the weapon! I’ll kill the son of a bitch! The court for everybody! Fucking bastards! To the court! To the court! What’s with him? Something serious? He’ll get over it. So what? There won’t be any court? Well, you know. A madman is a madman. Do you remember your name? Well? How did you get here? Faster. It’s ok. Quiet, be quiet. Ok. All right. That's all I can do for you. SPRING 1941 Get up! Get up, you dupes! It’s holiday today! We’ll all have fun! And those who won’t, I’ll fucking kill them. Fucking kill them! Get up! Silence! Can you hear, you morons? It’s heaven! You’re in heaven! Stop! And now, you morons, watch Osipow having fun! Silence! The rats got in. Come here! Let me introduce to you our new sensation! Tabula rasa! He doesn’t know, who he is, or how he got here and why he has the privilege of being in our resort. He really doesn’t remember anything? He forgot about those things as well. Go! We’ll see. Shall I put it out on your face? - Aren’t you afraid? - No. Do you trust me? Well, and what?! Fucking cherry boy! You think you're so innocent! Life will teach you yet! You’ll see what it is like... "...for the passers-by. Unfortunately..." "birthdays are only once a year!” "I play the harmonica..." "... for the passers-by..." See how easy it is? Move! We're going out! Faster! Look! There! Go on, look! There is home. Can’t you see it? After all, it's only 6,000 kilometres. Hey! Hey, hey! I’m here. Here! I’m here! Can you hear me? Get smart or they trample you to death, like ants! Tabula rasa! What the fuck? Are you making a brothel out of a decent hospital? What’s gotten into you? Going for a walk without a pass?! Have you gone mad? Bandit! Swindler! Who do you think you are? Casanova? To hell with you...! Don’t get involved with anybody. Listen to me only. You will sleep here. Good morning! The authorities make the rules. It’s easy to learn them. Don’t worry, watch yourself and you’ll get out sooner. Madame Lucienne, Madame Lucienne, it started! Stupid woman. Slept with someone not thinking of a child... Water, sheets! You are learning fast. Well... She will take you on a trip to Paris. But you don't know what Paris is. Go to your bed. Go. The Germans attacked the Soviet Union. Stalin declared an amnesty for the Poles who will join the Polish army. You should go. I like being with you. It will pass. I would give my soul to find my daughter and go back home to France. I only came here to save my husband. They accused him of espionage. I couldn't help him and I got 5 years myself. They took my daughter and put her in an orphanage. She was three years old. All right... we’ll see. Well, what’s that? Let me through! Let me pass! Calm down! Calm down. Slut! Hiding a child intended for transport?! They’ll kill us all! What am I to do with it? An inspection will start, they’ll be checking. It’s your business! What do you want? You're in charge here, you decide. Go! He’ll die anyway. He won’t survive the trip. It’s better to end it right now. Fuck! Lucienne. I did everything to get out. Only this one... And now... Osipov will spill everything and I won't get out. Stupid me! And my daughter - somewhere in an orphanage. She’s eight now. The daughter of the people's enemy. Where to, you scum? Get out! What’s that?! Let go! Get out! Are you mad? Let go! What’s that? Let go! I’ll kill you! Let go! I’ll kill you! Let go! - Will you tell? Will you? - My word of honour, I won't. What for!? An animal, not a man. What do you want? And you? There is the possibility of joining the Polish army. The prisoners of Polish origin report to Barrack No.3, where the conscription takes place. They will be released from work obligations, while retaining their food rations. AUTUMN 1941 Piotr Buchajski. Slawomir Panamarienko. Kazimierz Stopko. Waclaw Knap. Zdzislaw Skrobek. Take your things and go to the exit. The Germans are near Moscow. Stalin had to agree to the Polish army. You'll see, we'll all be released. They have no choice. - No order, no transportation. - How long do we have to wait? Repeat after us, it's a prayer. You’ll understand it later on. "Dear Mother, Protector of man...". "Holy Mary, Mother of God, Pray for us". "May the cry of orphans move you to pity". - And me? - Wait! "We, exiled children of Eve..." How long are we to wait? There’s no order! "...implore you..." There’s no transport! And me? I’m not on the list. That’s not fucking fair! "...have mercy, have mercy, do not allow us to go wandering around the world". Well, you’ve had your fill for free, now go to work! In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors... SPRING 1942 I am asking for penance and priestly absolution. I absolve thee. God bless you. He’s a priest. Are you crazy? You’ll get us all killed. Shut up, you scumbag! Let him be. He doesn't know what he's doing. He’s a priest. I have to report it. Tania, calm down, please. Tania! Enough! Send him with this letter to the camp foreman. He deserves a lighter job. Go home! Attention! March off! Calm down, I’m telling you. I was asked to send him to the camp, but I don't have to. He’s yours. Go on, eat! Eat! Eat or you’ll die too soon. Never mind. They will stop it. They’ll get bored. He had enough. Enough of that! Do you hear me? Help! Oh, my God! Andrzej! My name is Andrzej Klonowicz. Born on 2 January 1918 in Warsaw. In Warsaw. My name is Andrzej Klonowicz. Andrzej Klonowicz. Andrzej Klonowicz. AUTUMN 1942 Sanitary inspection. It’s declining. Our Camp Centre no. 7 is declining. The majority died or went to war. The only ones left in our ward are three incurable and probably immortal lunatics. What about the others? Teresa died in childbirth. Lucienne was transferred to a maximum security camp. Osipow went mad. He fled towards Peking. Doctor! Doctor! Faster! Tania, my daughter, my child... How to put it? This child is a floozy. She sleeps with all the soldiers. Such a child... and three men in one day. She drives me mad! The exile will end soon, we’ll go back and be amongst people, and what will become of her then? Please, Doctor, help. Save us. Calm down. Put these drops in her tea and she'll fall asleep. Then bring her here. Father! Father! Father, let me out! What’s with you? What do you want? This? - You’re a patient. - No. A patient. Then who are you? What’s your name? Tania. Where are you from? From Moscow. And who are you? - A doctor? - No. Doctor! Doctor! Tania, Tania, Tania. I’m not a doctor, I’m your friend, don’t be afraid, you’re ill... You’re lying to me. - I'm here only for you. - That’s not true... - So that you have someone to talk to. - Not true... I’ll tell you now how it is to be free. You probably forgot everything by now. AUTUMN 1943 There! My rescuers are coming. Please, please. Come in. Please. Please, please. Come in. They are our rescuers. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. Go in, young man. You came. - How are you? - Good. We’ve prepared a wonderful sauna for you. And this, my boy, is your reward. Just before our departure, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, having granted the request of Polish patriots, agreed to the formation of a Polish division, named after Kosciuszko. The formation of the division has already started. Right. And we can go to the sauna. Let’s go. Please. You too will be free soon. Come over, please. Find me. You will join the Komsomol, you will go to the army, you will become a real Soviet man. I will become a real Soviet man. Yes. A real Soviet man! A real Soviet man. Leave, Tania. Jozef Adamowicz. Pawel Bakowski. Stanislaw Racinski. Jan Zareba. Jozef Pilichowski. Marian Zasadzinski. That’s all. What... What happened? I was on the list, too! - Name? - Glazewski Jozef. Glazewski Jozef? Yes, report to the commander. - Because of leaving? - I don’t know. Glazewski Jozef is to be set free immediately. And can I go back home? Here is written, “to be set free”. That is, you can go behind the wires and settle there without the right to leave. Who did me such a nasty favour? The former commandant of the camp. Anything else? Jozef Grzegorz Glazewski wants to join the Red Army as a volunteer. As a free person, you have the right to do that. Thank you. Doctor! Doctor! You won’t believe it. I did it, Doctor! I did it! Look! Jozef Glazewski’s personal file. - It that you? - Yes. Now I can go to the Red Army assembly point. There I will say that I am a Pole and I want to join the Polish army. Good. Good. Here. Let's sit down, before you go. "I’ve been wearing heavy chains for a long time, I’ve been wandering in the mountains of Akatuy. An old pal helped me to escape... And I returned to life, experiencing the newly found freedom! I’m not afraid of Shilka and Nerchinsk anymore… The mountain guards... didn’t manage to catch me. The wild beasts didn’t touch me in the thickets, And the shooter’s bullet...". SPRING 1944 There! - Once more! - Stop it! Don’t be afraid! I'm Polish. I heard that I can join the Polish division. The Polish army is forming in the Ukraine. You have to go there. What about documents? A certificate... An envelope with NKVD seals is the perfect passport. Thank you. Arrest him. I'm sorry I forgot to say something. Glazewski is a false name. My name is Klonowicz, Andrzej. I come from Warsaw. Krucza Street 14, Flat 9. Now every spy comes from Warsaw since it is completely in ruins. You are lucky, my friend. They wanted to shoot you straight away, but like that you’ll live. - Can you tell me where I am? - Did you come from the Moon? No. From Siberia. You know, there was also a camp here. Only a German one. I mean, there was a concentration camp here. Have you not heard? Now, German prisoners of war are kept here. But I’m a Pole. But I’m saying that German... German prisoners of war, and those who collaborated with them, that is, the traitors of the homeland. I was fleeing from the Germans five years ago. Back off. I’m trying to explain to him and he’s picking on me. Well, you haven't stayed with us for a long time. Can you tell me what was in that envelope? What envelope? The one from the NKVD, that I gave you. You are a very curious man; be careful... Come on, take your things. They’ll be useful to you. Girls, let's not be afraid. Let's tell them who we are. We are all from the Home Army. They’re taking us to Siberia. Let Krakow know! We only take Volksdeutsches and collaborators! They are not Home Army, they’re bandits! Those women who say they are from the Home Army, are German whores. Get into the truck!
