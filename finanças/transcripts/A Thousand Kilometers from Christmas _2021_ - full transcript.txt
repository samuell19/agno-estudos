NETFLIX PRESENTS [upbeat music playing] [crowd chanting] Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! All right. All right, hold on. Shush, hey, quiet everyone. Of course I'm going to talk, just like every Christmas. You thought you'd get out of it? I propose a toast to celebrate that we're ending the year with the best results of the decade. [all] Hooray! - Congratulations and merry Christmas! - [all] Cheers! - [glasses clinking] - [woman] Happy holidays. [party horn screeching] - [man giggles] - [indistinct chatter] Well... Going now, Raúl? He's trying to make a French exit. Hey! [hesitates] Ah... Álvarez... Uh, no, of course not. With all the fun we're having? No. - I'm just going to the bathroom. - Hurry back, yeah? We just ordered a round of tequila. [all] Shots! Shots! Shots! - Shots! - All right! - Shots! - [man 1] Shots for everyone! Oh, hey, Raúl, hold on a second. I need to ask you something. What do you think? As someone who has no friends in this office, - you'll be objective. - What did you say? They should have promoted me instead of brown-nosing Sanchez, right? - My numbers are way better, right? - Sure. Everyone knows that. It's one of the great injustices of human history. Awful, Morales. If I were you, I'd tell the boss right now. Strike while the iron is still hot. Son of a bitch. Yeah, you're right. Emilio, we need to talk. [upbeat music playing] [woman] Thanks a lot. Merry Christmas. - [boy] I really love that. - [girl] Me too. - [boy] Here! Go on! - [firecrackers explode] Christ... [firecrackers pop] - Whoa, look out. - Please, be careful. [drunken singing] [streamer screeching] Son of a bitch. - [woman] Hey, photo? - No, I'm in a hurry. I don't take good photos. [man singing] Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. [Santa] Ho, ho, ho, ho! - No, thanks. - A piece of fudge? - [Santa] Ho, ho, ho. - I don't like fudge. [Santa chuckles] Ho, ho, ho. - Please. - Go on, take a little piece of fudge. - Come on. - Really. I said no! You can't talk to Santa like that. [sighs] Listen, sweetheart, this man is not Santa Claus. He's just a guy without a job, and probably an alcoholic, who wears these ridiculous outfits so he can pay his rent and buy some cheap wine. [gasps] Right? [woman] Don't cry. Don't listen to him. MERRY CHRISTMAS [text message alert] - Son, I never catch you when I call. - I'm very busy, Mama. [mother] Tell me you'll be home for Christmas this year. - Do me that favor. - No. [mother] Come on, Raúl, I bought you lobsters. You love them. You know I don't like lobsters, Mama. [mother] What? So now you don't answer your Mom's calls? How wonderful. You should be ashamed of yourself. Right, I'll stop calling, then. DEAR MR. MERINO, - [upbeat music playing] - [waves lapping] ONE WEEK TO YOUR VACATION ENJOY THE CARIBBEAN - [busy traffic] - [horns honking] [girl] Check out this photo. [woman yawns] - Raúl, the boss wants to see you. - [Raúl] Mm-hmm. [knocking] Come in, Merino. The door... Just shut it quietly, please. The gin may be premium but so is the hangover. - [chair creaks] - [Emilio groans] Sorry. I'm sending you to audit a firm out of town today. - Enjoy. - What? No, no, no, there must be a misunderstanding. I told you months ago that I was going to Cuba. I know, like you do every year. To escape Christmas, right? Yes, well of course I want to be as far away as possible from this nightmare of twinkly lights, Christmas markets, fruitcakes... Now, Raúl, I have to know. Why do you hate Christmas so much? [distant carolers singing] Bravo! Look, Jasper, it's Melchior. That king's my favorite one. [carol singing intensifies] - [Jasper barks] - Stop! Look out for my dog. - [dog yelps] - [all gasp] [woman] Poor thing. [whimpers] Jasper... [whispers] Jasper. Uh... No reason. I just don't like it. You'll find someone else. There's no one else. Ramón is off already and Carol just gave birth to twins. - But I'm going to... - But nothing. Job's a cinch, I promise. You'll be done in a few days. Plenty of time to catch your flight and get away before the holidays start. This is the company file. It's a food factory in Valverde, in the Pyrenees. No matter what, I'll catch my plane on the 24th. Sure, of course. Good luck, Raúl. - [door slams] - Ugh, that ass. [playful operatic music playing] [sniffs] [music continues] Not so bad. Little town. Go right, nearly there. [dramatic sting] [man 1] Hello! Welcome. - Welcome! - [Raúl] Oh, God. - Hi, how are you? - Hi! - What a nightmare. - [woman] Hello! Merry Christmas! My God. Just my luck. - [man 2] Stop! Not that way! - Yes, hello. Yes, I know that it's Christmas. God, how obnoxious. - [Raúl screams] - [tires screech] [wood splintering, thuds] - [man 3] What happened? Is he all right? - Fantastic. Terrific. - [metallic scrape] - [navigator] Recalculating route. Precious. [gasps] Did you get hurt? Are you okay? Oh, sure. Just brilliant. I almost died, but apart from that... - My God, what a disaster. - [woman] Don't be like that. Not now. You know, it's almost Christmas, the season of good cheer. Wow. [laughs] - Why is there a house in the street? - It's not a house. It's a manger. - [Raúl] A manger? - Yes. - We perform a Nativity every year. - [laughs] How stupid. What a load of crap. Well, I think it's a beautiful tradition. I've been director of the Nativity for eight years. We all waste our time how we choose, yeah? Now, if you don't mind, I have to get back to the real world. Son of a bitch. She's an idiot. - [navigator] Turn around when possible. - [sighs] If only. [man] Excuse me, sir. [coughs] Could you hand me that branch? I saw this poor little fellow here all on his own, and honestly? I felt bad for him. So I built him a little friend. Yes, because life is only worth living when you have a companion to share it with. Wouldn't you agree? [shushes] Don't give an answer. Just ponder it. [knocking] [Christmas carol playing on radio] Hello? That photo is of the snow fall in '73. We were cut off for a whole week. Nine months later, more babies than ever were born in Valverde. [chuckles] Nice to meet you. I'm Blanca, owner of this place. Blanca, "white" just like Christmas. - Raúl Merino. - You're staying until the 23rd, right? You're going to love our village. Are you here for work or as a tourist? Not that it's my business. A butter biscuit? Or I can make you something nice and hot. Some crispy fried eggs? - Mine are a real treat. - No, I don't want anything. I just want to go to my room and get some sleep. [Blanca] Mm-hmm. You'll be staying in suite Melchior. - What? You said Melchior? - Yes, there is suite Melchior. We also have rooms called Gaspar and then Balthasar. Suite Balthasar is very beautiful. - Your suite. It's a little dark. - Hmm. Because of its interior. Hmm. - May I have the key, please? - Of course. - I'm here if you need anything at all. - Thank you. Thanks a lot. - [Blanca] Twenty-four seven. - Thanks. [Blanca] Uh-huh. [sighs] [mischievous music playing] [exhales] - [engine sputters] - [coughs] [Raúl] No way. [engine sputters] [navigator] You've arrived at your destination. [engine stops] [alarm pinging] YULETIDE CONFECTIONERY AND FUDGE FACTORY - [phone disconnects] - [Raúl] "Yuletide?" Are you kidding, Emilio? You sent me to audit a Christmas fudge factory? And marzipan. They cover the full range of Christmas confectionery. [Raúl] You know I can't stand Christmas. It's why I didn't tell you. I knew you wouldn't have gone. Really? Well, you can find someone else because I'm coming back to Madrid. Sure. Well, that's fine. I'll have your severance ready. Because I'm telling you, unless you do your job, you're fired. So, then I'm fired, but I'm leaving here immediately. Very well. He'll be staying. [engine clattering] [engine stutters] [engine dies] Magnificent. [mutters] This is bullshit, dammit. He's not a boss, he's a crook. Making me do this, come to this stupid town. [phone ringing] Good morning. Good morning. Welcome to Yuletide Confectionery. Sweets, fudge and toffees, marzipan and lollies. [giggles] How can I help you? I've actually come to audit the factory. - My name is... - Raúl Merino, right? Mateo Salinas, director of the factory. A pleasure. - How was your welcome into town? - Well, it was impactful. Around here we're like one big family, right Luisa? Yes, yes, yes. - You'll get to know us. [laughs] - I can't wait. I spent years traveling, seeing the world, but... Nowhere is like this place. I came a year ago to take over for my dad. He's been losing his faculties as he gets older. Eh... Such is life. Well, if you could tell me where to set up... The sooner I start, the sooner I'll finish. - Of course. We have an office for you. - Perfect. But you'll want to see the factory first, right? - [snaps] - Come with me. Oh, fudge. [Mateo] Here, I'll show you the whole process. The almonds are roasted in these ovens. Follow me. - [crackling] - I love that sound. Do you hear it? It's the almonds traveling through the factory along this chute to here, where they're mixed with the paste to achieve that texture. Fascinating. [Mateo] This is Arturo, our master fudge maker. If you have any questions about the world of fudge, he has the answer. Sweet, but not too sweet. Quite firm, but without lumps. It's like popping a piece of pure Christmas in your mouth. Thank you, Arturo. Mm-hmm. [retches] [Mateo] Here you can see how the paste has become a solid block. Magic. [swishing] These blocks are then cut into tablets, ready for packaging. - Good morning, Pilar. Sagrario. - Hello there. [Mateo] This is where our fudge gets all dressed up, ready for all the family dinners across Spain. Marga's been with us for 20 years, isn't that right? Yes, yes, can you believe it? Since the birth of my first child. - And she has five, total. - [Marga and Mateo chuckle] We can't make marzipan in the shape of a dog. Children just wouldn't eat a man's best friend. A cat? Maybe. But a dog? Never. [Mateo] Our R&D guys. Real pros. Do you know what our greatest pride is? - Huh? - [snaps] That our factory employs most of the people in the village. [inhales deeply] [man] I finally did it. Yes. - Yes, I really did. - Hold on. I know that man. - Aren't you... - You're going to fly. My father. Owner, and life-blood of the factory. Dad? Say hello to Raúl Merino. Shooooh! [Raúl screams] [Raúl splutters] - Papa. - What did I do? [panting] [concerned chatter] Where is the bathroom located? [Luisa] The taxi will be here in an hour, give or take. One hour? [Luisa] There's only one for the whole valley. Of course. - But I do have some good news. - Mmm. The tow truck came to pick up your car. Great. Isn't it? Are you going to Valverde? We'll take you. We have a gynecologist's appointment. Uh, no. Thank you, though. I'm fine walking. But it's December. We can't let you walk five miles in the cold. No way, you're coming with us and that's the end of it. I wouldn't argue with her if I were you. She's very stubborn. I mean, I didn't want kids and now... - I'm José María. - María José. José and María? - José María. - María José. - So, I'm José María. - And I'm María José. [both] We know it's confusing. [giggling] I'm just Raúl, that's it. Well, then, Raúl, let's go. Oh, your son is kicking me again... - Hey, Raúl. Do you want to feel him? - No! I mean, I can imagine. Not much longer to wait now. And hopefully he'll be born in time to play baby Jesus. Oh, yes, we put on a live Nativity every year. Right, I already met the director. - Oh, Paula? - Yes, that nut job. [chuckles] She's my cousin. Very creative. Is this it? I think it's about to rain. [intriguing music playing] - [footsteps] - Hello? - Hello. Need something? - Could you bring me a bath towel? - There aren't any. - Ah! I'll bring you a towel right away. Please excuse us. Thanks. Sweetie, take some clean towels up to the guy in the Melchior suite. - I'm going to the dry cleaner, okay? - [woman] Right away, Mom. [knocking] Come in, come in, the door's open. The car crasher? Nativity girl? - What are you doing here? - I'm always here. - It's my mother's inn. - Aren't I lucky? [laughs] Why do you say that? No reason. About the whole car thing... I'm sorry. We seem to have gotten off on the wrong foot. - No, no. - Friends? Can I have my towel? [Psycho ringtone playing] MAMA CELL - [woman] Wanna get that? - No, not now. Ah, well, okay. [music continues] - It's your mom. It could be important. - I asked for a towel. - Not for someone to meddle in my life. - Hey dude, how rude. - Here you go. Okay. - Thanks. - Hmm. - Much better, thanks. [door slams] [inhales, exhales] [bell tolls] - Hi. - [all] Oh, hi. Good morning. [all] Good morning! Can I help you? Yes. A little question. So what does an auditor do exactly? 951, 952, 953, - 954, 955... - Oh, I have a question to ask. - Just a second, please. - No, no, sure. I just wanted to know what degree you studied. You see, my eldest is really good at mathematics. Not the youngest. Oh man, the youngest is a bit dim. So I was thinking that maybe he could be an auditor. The eldest, you see. But hey, we can talk about this some other time. 971... - Dammit. - Right... [groans] One, two... Here? Aha! There it is. Oh... Oh, please. Excuse me, sir, and forgive my appearance. The truth is I had no time to comb my hair. You have a good day. Yes, you as well. Nothing, it's beyond repair. It's only good for sawdust. What do we do now? - We could try building a brand new one. - Great, so get started. It's just that either we delay the Virgin birth or we may not finish on time, you know? Oh, no, no, no. Come on, you guys can do anything. And plus Saint Joseph is the saint of your profession. Huh? Never mind. Paula, everyone's here. - Are we starting or what? - Yes, yes, let's go. - No, it's really important... - [Paula] Hello! Will you all form a line to choose your roles, please? Enter one at a time, if you would. What character do you want this year? Shepherd boy. Melchior, if possible. Gaspar. I really see myself as the Virgin Mary, but... I don't know. If you don't, then... the head washerperson. Centurion. Well, I'd prefer to be Saint Joseph. Really, anyone but Balthasar? We'll see, Kareem. I was thinking, I dunno, washerman? I brought a few sandwiches and these little mandarins, in case you're hungry. Mama, this is the casting. [gasps] Ah! - Biker. - There weren't any motorbikes, Nico. - What is this? - Don't you have to adjust for millennials? I'd love to be the Virgin Mary. Baby Jesus. [María José] All right then, let's see. We have four shepherd boys, nine washerwomen, two Josephs, one chestnut vendor, that's me. Thirteen wise kings, fifteen virgins, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. And no messenger angels. - [knocking] - Good afternoon! How are you, family? - Girls. - Hi, Mateo. Okay, we have to rethink the cast. - What? - How come? - Problems in the Orient? - Many problems actually. If you're here for a part, I can offer you centurion, chestnut vendor or angel. The angel, honey! [Mateo] Ah... [chuckles] I'd really love to, but it's the busy season at Yuletide. - There's no time for anything. - Then, what is it you want? [Mateo] Come with me. - [gasps] - [whispers] What's happening? [Paula gasps] What's this, Mateo? I heard about the accident. I took the liberty of buying another one. Even better, it's all mahogany and Lebanese cedar. I hope you don't mind I didn't check with you first. Why would I mind? Look at this. It's so amazing. - Really, thank you. - Well, it's nothing really. Oh, I was wondering. Are you free sometime this weekend? We could have dinner at El Fogón. - Or... - Um... Mateo, it's... Oh, it's just that... I don't want to go on a date with you. You know, not today or 15 other times you asked me this year. Who said it was a date? It's just two friends having dinner celebrating the holidays. Sure, in a private area of a romantic restaurant. - Come on, Mateo. I know you. - [laughs] Okay. I admit it. I'm a pest. But you have to admit when we were kids, we were a perfect couple. [giggles] No, we were two 15-year-old kids who kissed a few times. Seven. Mateo, listen, I love being your friend and I want to stay that way. But nothing else. - If you want to take your gift back... - No, what are you saying? Oh, come on! Do you think I bought this very expensive Nativity set just to see if that would get you to go out with me? [chuckles, coughs] Right. Well, see you later. [Paula] Thanks so much for the gift. Seriously, you're such a pest about Mateo. - If I don't like him, I don't like him. - No, let's not go on about him. You'll find someone who sparks your heart. When I was 30 years old, I thought I'd never fall in love. But then, one day, at a party in town, I met a man who asked me to dance, and he held me... And when he held me, I felt something I'd never felt before then. Really? [Blanca sighs wistfully] I wanted to dance with him for the rest of my life. Oh, Mama... If he was that special, how come you never mentioned him before? What do you mean? He's your father. Oh... [chuckles] [kisses] [indistinct chatter] [laughter] Hey, that's the new guy, right? - [Luisa] The auditor. Oh, yes, yes, yes. - Raúl! How are you? I'm fine, thank you. [both] Sit and have lunch with us, come on. No, I'm really busy. I was planning to eat a sandwich at my desk while I work. If we don't even have a minute to enjoy a nice lunch, then what are we? Uh, busy people? - No. Barbarians. - Right. On that note... Bon appétit. - Thanks. - You as well. He's not exactly friendly, is he? [sighs] Oh! Oh, shit. Damn, I knew it. RESTROOM [Luisa] The story of our factory began a very, very long time ago. In 1912, Marcial Salinas, an expert in the technique and tradition of making the finest Jijona fudge, decided to open a family business that ended up becoming this factory, which today sweetens palates across Spain and is the pride of our village. When I grow up, I want to be a master fudge maker like my dad. What a great idea. I'd like to have a pastry shop when I grow up. - [scoffs] How pathetic. - Have you seen how great this is? Girls and boys around here don't dream about becoming footballers or YouTubers. No, of course not because you make it your job to brainwash them. It's a practice known as "Christmas indoctrination." If you stay this cynical, you'll have an ulcer by the time you're 40. Oh, great. Just what I needed. Uh, what are you doing here? I should ask you. I'm the kids' teacher. But don't you work at the inn and direct a Nativity? [chuckles] If only that was it. [children singing] ♪ Silent night... ♪ We use the other hand to apply pressure. What do you think Charles Dickens was saying through this novel? [man screams] [man] Stop! What do you think? Oh, Paula! She thinks whatever she does for the village is never enough. - All right, kids, I'm going to show... - You ought to realize we're not like city people here. You probably don't even know your neighbors in Madrid. [laughs] You say that like it's a bad thing. But it's ideal. That way, no one meddles in your life. I think a life with no one meddling in it is a little sad, right? [Luisa] Look! Well, who do we have here? - [kids] Hello! - How sweet. How are you? This is Mateo Salinas, the director of Yuletide. You have all the fudge you could want. You must be the happiest man alive, right? [scoffs] No way. This is disastrous. Truth is, I can't complain. With all that fudge... Although I think it takes more than fudge to feel happy and complete. - [Luisa] All right, let's carry on. - [Mateo] Of course. - Be good. - [Raúl] I'm gonna work. I think my saccharine levels are rising. You can laugh about our Christmas spirit if you want, but when many villages emptied out because there was no work, we had the factory. Christmas, literally, saved our lives. That's great. I literally wish the very best for you. I plan to spend Christmas on a beach drinking daiquiris a thousand miles from the nearest Nativity, hmm? You're a little Grinch. What's so bad about Christmas? [playful music playing] You're a sucker! You're a sucker! [girls giggling] What do I think is so bad about Christmas? Nothing. Apart from having to visit with relatives you really despise, and buy millions of things you don't even need, and then stuff yourself like you're some pig. There's the fudge commercials, ignoring diseases linked to the over-consumption of sugar, and those awful Christmas carols drilled into your head on every corner. The streets all lit up with tacky lights, having to pretend you're happy so people don't get mad. What do I think's so bad about Christmas? What's so bad about Christmas? - Everything! All of it! - Please stop. Because Christmas is garbage. [kids] He's the Grinch. He's the Grinch. He's the Grinch. - The Grinch! - [Luisa] Kids. Kids, come on, please. He's the Grinch. [all laughing] [Luisa] Come on. That's enough. I don't want... Quiet, please. Sh... [indistinct chatter] [chatter stops] Good evening. Hello, good evening. How are we? - Well... - [Kareem] You're the auditor, right? The one staying at Blanca's inn, who hates Christmas. [chuckles] Oh, it's a small town. Sure, so you know what drink I'd like, then. No. Never mind. A glass of red, please. Red wine coming up. Oh, hey, can I ask you a question, between us? Sure- So why do you hate Christmas so much? Hmm? [man] Get ready, the clock will chime in a few moments... - [woman] How much longer, Ramón? - [Ramón] The clock is... There it goes. The ball is dropping. No, those are the quarter strikes, then the bell will chime. I know. - Hey, where's Candela? - [girl] No idea. I can't wait until the ball drops. Come on! - Now, now, now, almost. - Come on! [bell chimes] [bell tolls] [dramatic crash echoes] With Tobías, my best friend? Happy 2005! Tobías. Eh... No particular reason. I just don't care for it. Between you and me, I'm not all that thrilled by Christmas either. All the tinsel, the worn-out carols, the children, "Ha, ha, ha!" - Begging for presents... - I'm with you. What are you talking about? Oh, not much, just chatting, Don Rafael. This guy is just... Whoo! Well, merry Christmas, Don Rafael. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Another. - Yes, of course. [cell rings] Hello? Yes, that's me. [gasps] What? [shrieking] Yes! Yes! [screaming] Hey, listen up! Excuse me. Listen up, everybody, I have really big news. After applying every year for five years now, Guinness World Records has finally accepted our application. [delighted cheers] We're going to beat the record for the biggest dramatized live Nativity in the world. At the moment, the record is held by a village in South America. - But we're gonna beat 'em, right? - Of course we will. Of course we will! [Paula giggling] If you want a role now, we're taking applications. - Really? - Yes. I would love to, actually. There's just one problem. I'm not six years old. Uh, you are such a jerk. Now, how about a round on the house? ["Más Que Mucho" by Muchachito Bombo Infierno playing] [whistling] [both giggling] Excuse me, excuse me. [both chuckling] [music continues] CHRISTMAS MUS TOURNAMENT [music fades] [bell tolls] All right, let's see if it works. - Pull him up. - Let's go. Jesus, which one of you is pregnant, you or your wife? - Come on, Martín, put your back into it. - Here we go. [grunts] Okay, okay, okay. It works. Put him down. [clacking] Come on. Get me the hell down. Hang on. It looks like it's jammed. It's not moving forward or back. This pulley is older than I am. We need to buy a new one. - [yells] - What is it, honey? Is it coming? No! Not that. I just got off the phone with Santiago, the farmer. - Josefina has died. - Oh, God... - Who's that? His wife? - If only. It was his mule. He was going to lend it to us for the Nativity. So tell me, Paula? How can we fix this? Well, we'll find another one, even if we have to pay for it. - Paula! - Oh, what else? What is it? Please tell me you have some good news. I'm sorry, I don't. If we want to dress everyone who signed up to beat the record, we're gonna need more costumes. Yes, I know we need more costumes. - But how many are we talking about? - It's looking like about 40. - [screams] Forty? Oh my God... - I'm sorry. [man clears throat] One little question, Paula. Do you think the budget can cover all expenses? The pulley, the costumes, the lighting, the ox, the mule, the carthorse... It's... It's just... [chuckles] Don't worry, okay? I will find us a solution. So, no one is going to be let down, okay? Hello? [door shuts] Oh, hi. [sighs] It's the budget for the Nativity, if you're interested. [chuckles] No. I mean, I don't care either way. But is there a problem? Yes. I'm trying to square the accounts but with this whole record thing, it's all gone over budget, and... Well, to you, this is all just Christmas nonsense, right? Sure, but... I'm also an auditor. What I mean is when it comes to work, we don't care what we audit. It's almost like we're machines. Cold, direct and unfeeling. [laughs] And that, spoken like a psychopath, is your way of offering to help? [chuckles] Yes. All right, I'm all finished now. Basically, the problem is you were only looking at the expenses, and not the yields. What do you mean, yields? Only thing I yield is problems. Come on, bear in mind, lots of tourists will come to see the Nativity. That means money for the bars, restaurants, stores and the town council. All through local sales taxes. - All right. And what do I do? - No, you do nothing. But I've created a financial plan for you with an estimate of the income Valverde will get from the Nativity. If you present this masterpiece to the town council, they'll increase your budget, no question. - Are you sure? - Oh, yeah. [laughs] Oh, thank you, so much. No, really. Thank you. It's not often I get to feel like a hero. When there's a problem, nobody shouts, "Is there an auditor in the house?" [chuckles] What is it? Why are you giving me that look? No, it's just if you scratch the surface a little, you're not quite the Grinch you appear to be. [clunk] Ah, man, a fuse must have blown. - Your fuses are really in the basement? - [giggles] Yes, what's wrong? - Are you scared? - No. - I'm just saying it's not practical. - Watch out... - ...for that beam. - [sighs] Are you okay? - You warned me just in time. I'm fine. - [giggles] - Look. Those skis belonged to my father. - Ah. And those were mine. He taught me how to ski on them. - When did your father pass? - When I was little. He was sick for a year, and when he died, my mother decided to turn the house into an inn. Whenever I'm sad, I come here. He always knew how to make the people around him feel good. Just like you, huh? [shy giggle] I want to show you something. Here, hold the light. That's my father. - Wow. - And that's me. Wasn't I pretty? - Very. - [laughs] Here, this mountain is so beautiful. It's a shame you're not staying longer because I think you'd love it. Yeah, but... I was planning to finish up and I have a ticket to Cuba. - Of course, your trip. - Yes. - And then there was light. [chuckles] - Yes. - Guess we should get to bed, then. - Yes. - To sleep. - To sleep. Of course. So... - Yes. - Yeah. - Right, let's go. - Let's go. - [yelps] Oh! - Oh! - Sorry, Raúl. - Sorry. [bell tinkles] [child 1 on TV] ...808. - [child 2] 808. - [woman] 50,000 euros. - [child 1] 72,870. - [woman] There it is! [squeals] - [Marga] I won! - [José María] Winner? - How much? - Your money back. - That's all it is? - Marga. - I'll go into labor. - [Marga] It's not about money. It's the hope of winning. [humming] Ba-ba-ba-ba. [dramatic music playing] The indirect expenses don't match the figures on the balance sheet. - They're overvalued by about 10%. - Wait. Are these the only accounting records that you have? - Yes. - Then they are not right. I honestly don't know what could have happened. - If I had a euro every time I heard that... - But I mean it. I'm telling you. - I have no idea what's going on here. - Well, you should because it's serious. Oh, please excuse me, gentlemen. Do you happen to have a stamp? Dad, hold on, please. This is really important. This is too, son. I need to send my letter to the Three Kings. I'm running out of time, Mateo. We don't have a stamp, Dad. - Ask Luisa. I'm sure she does. - Oh, perfect. You know, son, I've been a very good boy this year. [chuckles] What about you, son? Hmm? Have you been good too? [delighted chuckle] Excuse the interruption. But I think I know now where the errors cropped up. My dad managed everything until recently. The accounts, personnel, everything. You can see the state he's in. I'm very sorry but I can't look the other way. No, no, of course not. But if you put this in your report, the bank won't renew our line of credit. Do you know what that would do to us? To think in the four generations that Yuletide has existed we've never had to fire anyone. No one, Raúl. - And I won't have a choice. - Hold on just a moment. Calm down. I wish I could do something, but I must include everything I find in my report. It's my job. So, include it all. That's all fine. But all I'm asking for is a little time to go over the accounts and find my father's mistakes. No, that's impossible. - I'm going to Cuba in a couple days. - Cuba! Please. Think of my employees. Raúl. It's Christmas. [groans] No, that one's not going to work on me, Mateo. I'm sure if you scratch the surface a little, deep down you're not the Grinch you seem to be. [grunting] [frustrated groan] A week, Mateo, not a day more. Thank you. God bless you, Raúl. [door shuts] [Christmas carol playing] Raúl! - I have some good news. - Oh, yeah? I took your plan to the town hall and they're increasing my budget for the Nativity. What did I say? Thank you. It's a shame you're leaving. Because you won't get to watch the Nativity. Actually I'm staying a few more days. - What? - Yes. You're going to stay? What I mean is, it's great you're staying. Yes, but it's... It's for a work thing. - It turns out... - You're spending Christmas with us? - It looks like it. - Oh, that makes me so happy. - [Blanca kissing] - [giggling] CLOSING AT EIGHT TODAY MERRY CHRISTMAS EVE! Afternoon, Edu. Merry Christmas. [humming] Merry Christmas! Honey, hurry with the brown crab. We're running behind. - I'm coming, Mom. Just relax. - [doorbell chimes] - [both] Merry Christmas! - [Paula] Merry Christmas! [Paula] Oh, don't you look beautiful! What are you saying? I look like I'm carrying a base drum. [laughing] Yes. - Really? - I'll go chill the wine. You're more gorgeous than ever, Mari José. Come and give me a hand. [María José] You're such a great cook. I'm starving. [Blanca] Well, they brought me really fresh seafood. Now we're all here. Merry Christmas. I thought I'd have dinner in my room. - I'll leave you to it. - What? I have my own tradition which is to go to bed at ten and pray nothing bad happens. So, good night. That's such nonsense. Of course not. You're not eating alone on Christmas Eve. [man] On this night, we commemorate the birth of Christ. Once again, I wish you all great happiness. - Grandma, let's change the channel. - With a message of faith, - anticipation and hope... - Grandma? [man] My family and I send you our seasonal greetings... - You okay? - ...and wish you all the best - for the coming year. - Grandma? [Blanca] Come to the table, everyone. The seafood is so fresh, it might just eat you. [Blanca giggles] He's thrown up six times since he found out I was pregnant. [women giggling] Oh, I remember when I was pregnant with Paulita. You know, the day I went into labor, there was an historic snowfall. And her father, Julio, and I rushed to the hospital in the car and got stuck in the snow. He was freaking out, when all of a sudden... When suddenly a man on a motorbike showed up on the road. Yes, and do you know who he was? [all] The gynecologist. The gynecologist, and he attended to me right there. In your father's Renault Fuego. So don't you doubt it, Raúl, my girl was born thanks to a Christmas miracle. - [oven bell tings] - [gasps] The vol-au-vents! That little smirk of yours tells me you don't believe in that sort of thing. [laughs] I don't know... Call me crazy, but no. I also don't believe in reincarnation or even homeopathy. Or gnomes. Come on, don't be like that. Some things... Mr. Skeptical, however it might annoy you, some things can't be explained. - Not yet. - True, because... [Raúl] People used to believe rain was a miracle, until someone proved it was condensation of water vapor in clouds. - Come on... - Whether we know or not, - everything has a rational explanation. - Really? [Raúl] Hmm. So how do you explain love? Every day people fall in love with someone who they rationally shouldn't fall in love with. But they can't help it. [nervous laugh] - Merry Christmas! - Cheers! Merry Christmas. The real miracle is that after this feast we still manage to down tomorrow's lunch. Yes, well, it's getting late for me so... - Thank you very much. - [knocking] - Honey, did you invite somebody else? - No. [Mateo] Evening! - [Blanca] Come in. - Is it very late? I couldn't get away before dinner. Blanca, Paula, even though you don't work at Yuletide, you're part of the family. [Blanca] Thank you. You're an angel. - Would you like a drink? - No, no, I'll leave you. It's late, no. Although I did happen to bring a bottle of Champagne. [Blanca whoops] Well, as I said, I'm turning in. Thank you for dinner. No, you're not going anywhere. We are three pairs now, so we can play charades. - [José María] Yes, charades. - Good idea, right? Great idea. I love playing charades. [José María] Stomach. Belly. - Raging Bull. - No, no, no. Ah... - Moby Dick. - Time's up. It was Rosemary's Baby. - Our turn. - Maybe you should go. No, you show us what you've got. Yeah, good idea. Moby Dick. [Mateo] Time. [puffs] Home Alone. - Yeah! - Come on, yeah! My clever girl. Robin Hood. Sister Citroën. Miracle of Marcelino? - Time's up. - It was The Hunger Games. You know, they have continued making movies post-Franco. Fiddler on the Roof. No, I can't, I don't... No, I don't get it. Time's up. Love Actually. - You should know our favorite movie. - Sorry, José. - But no one could've understood that. - Sure. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. - Go, Raúl. - [both laugh] Oh! Superman. Singin' in the Rain. - Time's up. - Mary Poppins. Damn. That was obvious. - Pulp Fiction. - Take that. The Grinch. - Yes! - [Paula laughs] All right! - E.T. - Yes! I knew that too. We'll never know. Pan's Labyrinth. That's it. Come on! [laughs raucously] Show offs. La La Land. - [Paula] Yes! - She didn't do anything. [laughs] Well, I'm just saying... - [claps] - How amazing. Well done. You're on a roll. You two are more on the same wavelength than two of us after 20 years together. This is more about luck than anything else. Sure, it may be luck, but I want you to be my partner forever. [laughs, stops] For my partner in charades, I mean. ["The Christmas Song" by Nat King Cole playing] [Paula] Oh, I adore this song. José, come on, let's dance. [José María] Okay. - Shall we dance? - No. - [Paula] Yes, come on. - No. Don't be silly, come on, let's dance. - Seriously, I can't dance. - I'll teach you. - You can't dance to this. - Yes, you can.

It was just a dance. - [Blanca] Ah? - [chokes] [Blanca] He's a terrible dancer. - Looks like it's time to go, right, Raúl? - [choking] Hey, Raúl wants to play another game of charades. - Then I'll get more Champagne. - Choke. - [gargling] - The Exorcist. - King Kong. - Wait, he's not playing. Are you guys crazy or what? Titanic. - Ow! - Oh, Titanic! Are you okay? Oh, Christ, what a fright. That was a close one. I'm fine. All good, I'm okay. Raúl, your jacket. [screams] Oh my goodness. - What shall we... - Oh, no. He's on fire! - Outside, - [Paula] Come on. - Out, quickly! - [Mateo] Outside. [Paula] Go! Go! José, do something! [José María] What? What do I do? - Give me your drink. - No! - Give it to me. - Come on. [Raúl exclaims] - You drinking alcohol? - Just a little. Oh, it burns! It burns! It burns!

[tranquil music playing] [knocking] - Who is it? - [Paula] Raúl? We've finished eating Christmas lunch. - You can come out now. - Come in, come in. You can't blame me. You saw what happened when I let my guard down. Get your jacket. We're going out. You'll love the plan. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. I'm still a bit singed. All right. IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE TODAY AT 18:00 [Raúl] No. Why this? What did I ever do? Don't be like that. It's a beautiful movie. - Every year I get more anxious. - Come on. If there's anything worse than Christmas, it's movies about Christmas. Sweetie, look, we reserved these two seats for you. - Thanks, Mom. - Let's go for a walk. - I can't go. - Why not? As president of the Valverde Film Club. I'm in charge of the screening. What a surprise. I should have guessed as much. - [both] A little hot chocolate? - [Paula] Thank you. Oh, thanks. You know, thanks for trying, but I'm not staying. No. Shush. - Rafa, we start in five. - At your command, Ms. Paula. All right, I'll stay. But I guarantee I'm not going to enjoy this much. - [vintage movie music playing] - [sighs] [man 1] Merry Christmas! [man 2] Merry Christmas, George! [woman] Merry Christmas!

And to tell you in a few days I'll have gone through all the errors in the accounts. That's good. In the meantime, I'll continue going over the paperwork, so you can take all the time you need. - You're cheerful, aren't you? - Oh? Well, I don't know, it's just... [inhales deeply] ...the mountain air is good for me. Yeah, mountain air... Well, you look really tired. - Did you have a late night, Raúl? - A little, but... - That is why I got a nice cup of coffee. - Sure. You get yourself a nice coffee. [Raúl] I did. You came here, got yourself a nice coffee, and didn't stop to think maybe I wanted a coffee? What is this? [laughs] I'm just kidding, dude. [laughs] Well, carry on. God, what a weirdo. [Paula] Seventy euros for a mule? Just for one day? No, no, no. But where's your love for your village? [Christmas carol playing softly] Thank you so much. Yes! We now have a mule. Paula, have you ever heard the little word "delegate"? Why do you say that? It's not like I do everything myself. - I mean... - That's enough. You and I are going to dinner. - Hmm? - How about that? Okay. MERRY CHRISTMAS [romantic music playing] [Raúl] Morales, Álvarez and Lozano. They're practically identical, like they're from the same litter. They're almost interchangeable. [chuckles] See? It's okay to forget about other people and think about yourself now and then. Yeah. It's just that I like to think about other people. Have you always been like this or are you going for sainthood? I don't know. You know, I think that because it was just me and my mom from when I was so young, everyone in the village became my family. And you'd do anything for family, right? - Of course. - But, hey, don't change the subject. I asked a question. You didn't answer. Why do you hate Christmas so much? I'll ask for roller skates, and maybe a pirate ship, and... [man] Raúl, your mom and I need to tell you something. [woman] Sweetheart, Dad and I are getting a divorce. [man] Don't worry. We'll see each other. You'll visit every other weekend. Really? [moans] Ho, ho, ho! All right, little guy, come here. Now, tell me. - What would you like for Christmas? - For my parents not to break up. [camera clicks] Would a video console do the job? [laughs] - Poor little Raúl. - No, I'm totally over it now. [chuckles flatly] Anyway, you can understand me a little. My parents ruined Christmas for me forever. Not forever, no. I'm going to make sure that this year is different. [waiter clears throat] [waiter] The check, when you're ready. Thank you. [humming] What? You don't trust them? I'm an auditor, Paula. People have tried to trick me in every way possible. - I don't trust anyone. - [scoffs] Well, that's a shame. You should know the whole world's not against you. I suppose you're right. They didn't charge us for dessert. See? [uplifting music plays] It's hard not to notice all the cobblestones when you walk... Oh, you're so silly. - [Psycho ringtone] - Oh, hold on. My mother again. Answer it. - Really? - Of course. Go on, I'll leave you to it. [Psycho ringtone playing] - Hello, Ma. - [mother] You're impossible to reach. - Sorry, I didn't answer earlier. - Sure, but we don't even speak at Christ... - I know that it's Christmas. - It's not right. - Can you let me speak, please? - Go on. - Thank you. - What? I will be working outside Madrid for a few more days. - Really? Where? - But if you would like... - What? - ...we can have lunch on New Year's Day. - Really? - Yes. Oh, son, I'm so happy. This really does make me happy. - Don't cry, please. It's not a big deal. - It's just, before you didn't even... [Raúl hums "Silent Night"] [kids] Sucker! Sucker! [boy 1] It's the Grinch. - Grinch! - [Raúl laughs] - [laughs] You're gonna get it! - [girl] Get him! - [boy]Come on. - [girl] Run! - Throw snowballs at him. Hurry! - Get back here, you little squirrels. - [kids giggling] - [boy] A big snowball. - [boy] Got him! - Raúl! Come on, we'll be late. No, no, no, yes... Goodbye, kiddos. - [kids] Bye, Grinch. - [Mara José] Ooh! It feels like your son is performing a dance on my bladder. Can I feel? - Well, of course. - [María José] Yes, if you want. Wow. That's amazing. [chuckling] Hold on, hold on, do you remember the time my ring fell off in the vat of marzipan? - [José María] No. - I almost had a heart attack. [all laughing] Raúl, why don't you join us for a card game sometime? Card game? - Yeah. - [Luisa] Unbelievable. It took years before I was allowed to join Arturo's games. Yeah, me too. Of course, Arturo, it would be an honor. - Thanks for the invite. - Yes? Bravo! [María José] You'll see, you'll have a great time. [Marga] Because Christmas is a time of hope, a time for life. Well done, Marga. We'll carry on tomorrow. That was beautiful. Better than the original. Great. Great. Gosh, looks like I missed rehearsal. Good, this way there are no spoilers. [laughs] Only you could make me laugh on a day like today. Why? What happened? Can we go somewhere quiet to talk? Uh, sure. So tell me, what's with all the mystery? This is our 5th grade classroom. You remember? This was my desk. MATEO FOR PAULA I used to sit here and dream of managing Yuletide. And look at you. Now you are. Sure, but I don't know if I will be for long. Why do you say that? What's wrong? Raúl found some errors my father made in the accounts. - What kind of errors? - Nothing. Just small stuff. - But he's going for the jugular. - No. Raúl comes off harsh, but he's a good person. Is he a good person, Paula? He showed me the total opposite. He's a bastard. Oh, Mateo, seriously? Are you jealous because I'm going out with him? Huh? No, I didn't know that. I'm sorry. Never mind. Go on. Tell me what Raúl said exactly. That he doesn't care my father's not well. Not his problem. He'll destroy us with his report, Paula. It may be the end of Yuletide forever. But that would ruin the whole village. No, Raúl wouldn't do that. He would have told me so. Maybe he knew if he said anything, you wouldn't have got involved with him. [Mateo sighs] Paula, I'm sorry to upset you. Think about it. Why should he care what happens to us? Once he's finished his report, he'll leave and we'll never see him again. [Luisa] Mateo was devastated. Because of Raúl's report. - They might shut down the factory. - What? Are you listening, José María? They're shutting down the factory. No, what are you talking about? He came here with his bad manners, cursing, insulting us... [exclaiming in Arabic] I heard that they almost came to blows. He's a really dangerous dude, huh? He is. And bam! Raúl punched him square in the face. God, how barbaric. He says he won't stop until he's ruined the entire village. Well, we'll see who's ruined in the end. I'll make sure. [indignant chatter] [chatter stops] Bon appétit. Ooh, rice looks delicious. Hey, Marga? Yes. [disgusted grunt] But I was just leaving. - Is she all right? - Like you actually care. [both] What? No, nothing. See you tomorrow, Luisa. Never come back for all I care. Hey, María, José! Wait up! - María José, María! - [María José] José, let's go. [shouts] José Ma... María José! - [horn honking] - Ah... I'll show you danger. [engine accelerates] - [horn honking] - Go ahead. [screams] - [horn honking] - [screams] [chuckling] [panting] [Raúl shivering] Hello. You have no idea of the day I've had. People are acting really weird. It's all... - Paula? - I have a question. Did you find any errors in your audit of the factory accounts? Well, yes. How come? I'm just surprised you didn't say anything. I didn't want to worry you. I think closing the factory and putting half the village out of work is something to worry about. Wait, what do you mean? - There's no reason for it to close. - Mateo told me everything. I don't know what you heard from Mateo, but I only found a few errors, and I had to include them in my report because that's my job. - It's what... - Sure, your job. - Yes. - What about other people's jobs? You don't care about putting María and José out of work - when they're about to become parents? - Sure, I care. I'm not putting anyone out of work. I gave Mateo a few days to fix the problem. It's why I stayed. That's not what he says. It's the truth. Why would I lie to you? Maybe you thought if you told me, I would not have slept with you. Paula, how can you say that? - You know that's not true. - Look, I don't know you. All I know is that you hate Christmas and then in a few days, you'll go to another village and factory, and destroy people who only want to do their job. - Do you really think that's what I'm like? - You said it yourself, didn't you? "Good auditors are like machines, cold and unfeeling." If you really think I have no feelings, I don't know why you're with me. I don't know either. [door slams] - [indistinct chatter, laughter] - Good evening. [chatter stops] Good evening, Kareem. A glass of red wine, please, Kareem. No wine. What do you mean? I see the bottle right there. That bottle? This one's reserved. For people from the village. That right? Hmm? [intriguing music playing] So then, give me another one. Anything. - I've got something special for you. - Thank you. ♪ Silent night ♪ ♪ Holy night ♪ ♪ All is calm ♪ - ♪ All is bright ♪ - [shimmering eerie music builds] ♪ Round yon Virgin, mother and child ♪ It's on the house. [whispers] Drink up. Oh, I didn't realize the time. It's late. I should be going. I have to leave. [man 1] Go away! - [woman] Get out of here! - [windows slam] [man 2] Shameless bastard! Good evening. [man 3] Riffraff! - [barks] - [screams] - [barking] - [gasping, panting] [panting] [barking continues] [grunts] [blues guitar playing] Good morning. [playful poignant music playing] [María José giggling] Morning. - [giggling stops] - [car alarm chirps] See you later. [sighs] No, there's no way. DAILY EXPENSES What great hospitality. Can I offer you a little broth, son? Yeah, I'd actually really appreciate that. This stuff could revive a corpse. [chuckles] Can I ask you a question? Well, of course you can, son. You seem to be the only person in the village who doesn't hate me. "Hatred is the madness of the heart." [chuckles] Lord Byron said that. Not me. Me? All I can do is paraphrase the great poet. By the way, do you know where your son is? I'd like to talk to him. Well, that makes the two of us. [Paula] Whenever you're ready. [Luisa whispering] Really, I mean, it's been so long. We come from the East, following a star... The Virgin and Joseph don't talk in this scene. - Let's see if we can keep quiet. - [Luisa] Sorry. Excuse me, Arturo. It's just the whole Yuletide problem is putting us all on edge. [Paula] Yeah. Except I don't care. We're here to rehearse the Nativity. Not to gossip. - I'm not gossiping. - Yeah. - Start again, Arturo, please. - Thanks. - We come from the East... - [drilling] Could you please make a little less noise? We're trying to rehearse. My bad, my bad. Thank you. Go on. - We come from the East... - [cell rings] How many times have I said to turn phones off in rehearsal, Marga? Yes, Paula, it's just that my youngest has angina. Paula, come on, maybe you should take it easy, huh? [Paula] Ah! [sarcastic chuckle] Well, okay, then, I'll take it easy. Just like you all. We'll look ridiculous in front of the World Record judges, yeah? - But you look like an idiot already. - Hey, watch yourself. Don't take it out on me. Not my fault the auditor turned out to be a jerk. - Oh! - [puffs] Who do you think you are, you little brat? Get out. - What is this? - [yells] I said get out! - All right, I'm going. - [Marga] No. - Screw this crap. - [Marga] Hold on. - No, Nico, slow down, wait a minute. - [Nico] No, I'm done. Whatever. [door slams] Please, start the scene again, Arturo. We come from the East, following a star in the heavens, to honor the King of the Jews. How's that? [sneezes] [Mateo] There's a high profit margin, right? And it all happens in Valverde. - Production, distribution, everything. - [Raúl clears throat] Heading home already? Some have all the luck. No, Mateo. I want to talk to you. [hesitates] Ah... - Go on. - What kind of lies did you tell Paula? She thinks it's my fault the factory is closing. Who said the factory's closing? No, no, no. She's got it wrong. You know what Paula's like. Don't you worry, in 24 hours, I promise I'll have worked out the accounts. - Okay? - No. I've been looking for you all day, Mateo. - To talk about... - Raúl, I'd love to but, dude, I can't. These guys want to steal the recipe for the soft fudge. But I tell you, they'd have better luck stealing the one for Coca-Cola. Twenty-four hours. Shall we do a tour? I'll show you. Come. [sneezes] Oh. [sniffs] [melancholy music plays] [sighs] [sniffs] - Another. - Paula. Tomorrow's New Year's Eve. We have the Nativity, plus the World Record people. Don't you think you might want to get some rest? No, I think it's best if you mind your own business. I've had enough of saying yes to everyone. Well, now I'm telling you all no. - [grunts] - No! - I'm not serving you another drink. - Yes, you are. Why not? Everyone gets drunk at Christmas. So am I. No, because you're drinking to forget, and you always say Christmas is an unforgettable time. [chuckles] An unforgettable time... You want to know what Christmas is, Kareem? - I think Christmas is fucking shit! - Hey. I've had enough of the shepherd boys, the marzipans, and the decorations. It's bullshit! - [Kareem] Not the ornaments! Paula! - Whoa! - What's going on here? - Look who it is. Mateo! Great to see you. [chuckling] [gasps] Want to have a drink? Uh, no, I think you're drunk enough for both of us. What you talkin' about? It's still early. - Nice watch. - Yes, it's my father's. How about I walk you home? Okay, let's go. - This is yours, right? - [sobs] All right. No matter how many times I go over it all, I don't understand how I could let myself be fooled like this. Raúl seemed so... So real and honest that... If it's any consolation, I thought he was a good guy too. Yes, but you didn't... Nothing. One thing's for sure. Only people from around here understand the true value of Yuletide. No auditor can put a price on that. [Paula sighs] Here I am crying like a drunken brat, and you could lose the family business. - Please, I don't want to think about it. - I'm so sorry. [sighs] All I want now is to go to my house in the Algarve, buy myself a little boat, and finally have some time to myself. Well that sounds exactly like what I need right now. Well, then. I have an idea. Why don't we go there for a few days once Christmas is over? That way we can forget about the business, auditors... And the Nativity, and the school, and the inn, and Raúl. - [both] Everything. - [Paula chuckles] It'll be perfect. Just you, me, and the sea. [romantic music playing] - Sorry, sorry. - No, it's... - Forgive me, I got carried away. - No, I... It's just, I'm a mess, and I... - I just need a little time. - Of course. Give me a hug. [rooster crows] [clock ticking] [woman on radio] Good morning. Rise and shine. The last day of the year has finally arrived. And we hope our listeners take part in today's festivities in Valverde, and make the most of the hours before midnight. Valverde is hosting what may be the world's biggest live Nativity. In fact, this afternoon, the residents of Valverde will attempt to break the Guinness World Record and engrave its name in history in gold letters. [frustrated groan] - Hello. - What do you want now? I want you to come back. I went a bit nuts, and I am sorry. Really. - That, and you need people for the record. - Nico! All right, I'll get my jacket. - Wait up, I'm just putting this on. - No, you can get dressed there. - At least let me carry those bags. - You already can't keep up. - Think I'm slow? Watch this. - Hurry! [Nico] Watch me. Vroom! - Hello. - Hello. - "Shepherd, to Bethlehem." - [laughs] Good luck today. Well, thank you. - Hey, boss, let's go. - Yes, coming. - Bye, Raúl. - Bye. [bells tolling] José. José. José. [intensely] José. Paula, which is more a Virgin face? This one? Or this one? The first face. The second one makes you look like you gave gas. - Paula, do you have a minute? - No. - Paula. - What? This is not myrrh. - These are peanuts. - Who cares? No one will see it. Sure, but I am a method actor. How can I get into character bringing bar snacks to baby Jesus? - [Marga] Paula! - What? - Come. Come. - [Paula] What's up? My face. Is this enough makeup? Or do I need more? You should tone it down a bit. You're a washerwoman, not Mary Magdalene. - You're serious? - Oh my God. - Paula, excuse me. - What? The mule has a bit of diarrhea, but don't worry. I fed it some rice. That's terrific. Anything else? Yes, actually. - I can't play Saint Joseph. - What? Excuse me, Paula, this here is Mr. Fuentes, he's the world record adjudicator. Paula! - No. - Paula? - Who's right here? - What's better? Angel or shepherd? That's enough! [objects clattering] Well... [laughs] I imagine that in all your work on world records, you must have seen stranger things, right? [chuckles] - [knocking] - [sobbing] [María José] Paula. Are you okay? Go away. I don't want to talk to anyone. [doorknob rattling] Come on, Paula, open up. Seriously, the world record guy is here. I don't care about the record, or the Nativity, or Saint Joseph or the fucking shepherd boys. I quit, María. What are you talking about? You're the one that makes everything happen. Yes, and now it's a disaster. Go tell them I'm sorry to let them down, but I can't do it anymore. [María José] What do you mean let us down? Everyone of us worships the ground you walk on because you've worked so hard. The other day we were even talking about it in the factory. How you've produced a spectacular Nativity all by yourself. You even managed to get them to increase this year's budget. PROPS Thank you. Although, actually, I didn't do that all alone. [cell rings] Good afternoon, Emilio. Happy New Year. - Enjoying the holidays? - [Emilio] Yes. It's always a pleasure to spend this time with my grandkids. - [glass breaks] - [boy] Look what you did? I was calling to ask you to come to a meeting on Monday in the office. Yes. I'm sorry. I should have called you sooner. But I'm still in Valverde finishing up the audit. Have you started on the Champagne early? [laughs] The report. You emailed it to me. I already sent it to the client. What do you mean, Emilio? I didn't send you the report. Hold on a minute. Who exactly requested that we audit Yuletide? - [Emilio] A Chinese investment group. - [laughter] They wanted to check the state of the accounts before buying it and moving it to their country. Fuck. Emilio, listen carefully. I never sent you a report. It was Mateo Salinas. He sent you a fake report from my email. All right, hold on. You're not getting carried away - by your personal hatred, are you? - What do you mean? - No, it's... - [Emilio] Hold on. Kids, go. Both of you. Out, out! Look, I heard you made enemies with the whole village, - because of how much you hate Christmas. - That has nothing to do with it. And falling in love with the director's girlfriend has nothing to do with it? She's not his girlfriend. She's mine. I noticed a few irregularities and told him so he could correct them. You told him? If you noticed some irregularities you should have put them in your report, Raúl, that's your job. I did it for every person in the village. They seem like good people. Ah! Sure, so what? You got caught in the spirit of Christmas. Please, Raúl, don't make me laugh. - [line disconnects] - Right. [growls] - [Raúl] Mateo? - Hey, man. - Raúl, what's up? Off to the Nativity? - No, first I must have a talk with you. I'd love to, man, but it's late. And I have guests. Guests from China perhaps? [laughs] China? That's a good one. I don't know what you mean, but I have to go. Really? I'll come with you. We can talk on the way. [scoffs] [Raúl] You falsified my report. - What? No, I didn't. - I know exactly why you did it too. Yes. And I'm sorry. It made me feel as bad as you do, but I had no other choice. You've got some nerve. Listen, Raúl, just between us, Valverde's great for a few days in summer to get away from the heat. But I don't plan to spend my life stinking of marzipan like my father. You must understand me. You want to clear out too. - No, I'm not conning anyone. - Raúl, I didn't pin you for a girl scout. I'm gonna make a fortune from this sale. I don't have to be the only one who benefits. - Are you really trying to bribe me? - You say that like it's a bad thing. Come on. 15,000 euros and we're cool. What do you care? Everyone in the village hates you. The village only hates me thanks to you, Mateo. Thanks to your lies. Do you not care if they're out on the street? They're families, with children, and mortgages... And they don't deserve this. Mateo, you still have a chance to stop this. Don't sell the factory. Think of your father. He never would have sold Yuletide. [sighs] Ah, fuck. [exhales] Okay, you're right. Jesus, money makes people do strange things. - [dramatic music surges] - [screams] [chuckles] [screams] [music stops] [wind whistling] [wind howling] This is the moment of truth. The moment we've worked so hard for. Today we're securing Valverde's place in history! [cheering] Now it's time to go out - in an orderly fashion... - [screams] What is it? Sweetheart, are you okay? [gasps] Yes, yes, yes. [panting] Oh! I think that was a contraction. No, it's just nerves. - Not nerves. Let's go to the hospital. - No, no, no, no! No, it was just one contraction. It can take hours to go into labor. But... Ah... That is true, yes, it's true. I can stay. I can stay. Anyway, I'd be really upset if I had to miss the Nativity. Wouldn't it be better if we went to the hospital? Just to be safe. She just said she wanted to stay. She should. Don't pressure her. Just take your place, please. - Paula, please. - You take your place, okay? Well, let's go. Come on, let's head out. [chuckles softly] [suspenseful playful music playing] [screams, gasps] [panting] [distant howling] NO CONNECTION Shit! [yells] [grunting] [dramatic music playing] [whimpering] [Raúl yells] Hello? I need help! Hello! [over PA] Hurry over or you'll miss the big Christmas performance. The actors are here getting ready, and are fully focused. The performance will be starting very soon. We're aiming for the record "World's Largest Live Nativity." - Give it what you've got, Valverde. - [moaning] Oh my God. - It's going well, right? - [Paula] Yes. Really, really well. Huh? [uplifting music builds] [laughing] [reindeer snorts] [crazed laughter] Come on, mush. To Valverde! [grunting] [Raúl] Come on. Giddy up! Yay! This way, José. Let's ask this kindly shepherd boy. - He will surely help us. - Surely he will. Excuse us. My wife is about to give birth and we need a place to rest. No way, my man. Sorry, the place is packed. - Nico! - I mean... Uh, there's not a single room left, sir. [Luisa] Don't be worried, José. God has readied a place for us. There in the manger. [both men] Oh! [scattered applause] Oh, Christ. Ooh! Oh! Ooh! Let's go! [clicking teeth] Ho, ho, ho, merry Christmas! - [reindeer bellow] - [screams] [Raúl whoops] [exclaims] Watch out for the slope! Ah! I can't believe they're real. Whoo-hoooo! To Valverde! Let's go. Well done, you guys. Faster! Let's go. Whoo-hooo! Yee-hee! Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! There's no more snow. You can go on the road. Come on, let's go! [Marga] Oh, shepherd boy, what news do you have? [Mateo] Good, good, good... Well, now that everything's in order, we can sign and celebrate the New Year in style. Hmm? [speaking in Chinese] He says he'd like to watch the Nativity scene first. He finds the tradition fascinating. [laughs] Yeah. Well, we still have time before the Kings arrive. [Arturo] Oh, a man and woman have come from Nazareth... - Hello. - Hello. Hope you enjoy the show. Thank you. [Marga] They have nowhere to sleep. [Arturo] They have found a manger. [Marga] They say she's about to give birth. - Praise the Lord! - [Arturo] Oh! - [hooves thumping] - [dramatic music playing] Wait, slow down. A little slower, please. Watch out for the... The cobblestones. Now, slow down. Easy! Watch out for the curve! Stop! [screams] Come on, Martín. Hurry up, please. - My daughter took my wings. - Go, go. Good work, guys. - José María! - Yes? - You're on now. - Okay. - Come on, put on the wings. - Ready. [Arturo] He is born! Baby Jesus is born! Remember to enunciate, okay? Here is the light of the world, a joy and hope for all. I'm so happy, María. "I bring you tidings of great joy." - All right? - I got it. Okay. What is this I hear? - Look how well my gal does it. - Could it be the cry of... [agonized cry] That's enough. We really are going to the hospital now. You can't go. She can't be more than three centimeters dilated. [agonized scream] I don't care, but I'm not playing Nativity while my son's about to be born. Please, you can't just abandon me. This is important! Look, Paula, if the Nativity is that important to you, your life must be more empty than I thought. Here. Sweetheart, are you okay? It's coming? For Christ's sake, let's go. [splutters] [panting] [Raúl] Dammit, let's go. [panting] [Paula] Mama? Mama? Oh, don't come near me with those wings, my love. Well, it's angel or chestnut vendor. Take your pick. Here is the light of the world, a joy and hope for all. I'm so happy, María. What is this I hear in the distance? Could it be the cries of a new-born? Child of God? [panting] We want you. It must be so exciting up there. [panting] Without an angel, we can't go on. Please! You guys. - Please, I'm begging you. - [Raúl] Paula! - [Paula] Raúl! Raúl! - Paula! - Paula! - Raúl! Do you want to be the angel? Oh, it's great you're here. - Mateo... - No Mateo. No time for jealousy. - Yes. - Listen to me. - Mateo... - Remember this phrase. "I bring tidings of great joy." "The savior's born, our Lord." - Yes? Got it down? I'm so happy. - The factory. Guys! Girls! Action! - Ready? Take him up! - Paula, listen. [panicked scream] [screaming continues, stops] Let's get inside. It's pretty much over. [Nico] Look! An angel! - [screams] - [light clunks] [crowd oohs] Come on, Raúl, say your line. "I bring tidings of great joy." I bring... tidings of... [Raúl whispers] ...great joy. Listen everyone. [woman] Oh, God. The factory is in great danger. - [crowd murmurs] - [Paula] What? Mateo Salinas is going to sell it. He's a crook and a liar. He conned you all. He conned me too. What's this guy's deal? He falsified the accounts to inflate the price of the company. Once it's sold, they'll move it out of the village. No! They'll shut down your factory. Son of a bitch. He doesn't care. He wants to desert you. He's even conned his father, who devoted his life to this village and to your factory. Traitor! [Luisa] What are you saying? Is what the archangel is saying true? Calm down. These things don't concern you. What do you mean? Don't concern me? Papa... Come on, relax, we'll sign and done. - It's all that's left to do. - [speaking in Chinese] [Mateo] What did he say? Don't forget the factory still belongs to me, son. May everyone know, until the day I die, this operation will stay in Valverde. - [cheering] - [grunts] [cheers and applause] [crowd booing] Traitor! [crowd booing] Get out! [man] Leave. [spinning] [screams] [cries out] - [cow moos] - [coughs] [Paula] Raúl, are you hurt? Are you okay? Yes. Yes, yes, I'm okay. The problem is I blew your shot at the record. Who cares about the record? [man] Long live the Grinch! The Grinch has saved Valverde! [cheering] It looks like an angel got his wings. [giggles] [moos] [sighs] My car. - [Paula] Perfect timing. - Yes. I have to tell you something. I know it'll sound crazy, even more so coming from me but... I think I witnessed a miracle of Christmas. When I was lost in the middle of the snow, a sled appeared, out of nowhere. - There it was. - It was Toño's sled. Who's Toño? Toño, he's Marga's brother. He runs excursions around the slopes. [chuckles] Of course. How silly of me. Of course. You take me to see Christmas movies and this is what happens. We take a trip every year with the school. The kids really love the sled dogs. [door shuts] Dogs? Hmm. Yes, why? Nothing, never mind. - Anyway, um... - All right. [kissing] - Uh, take care. - You as well. - Goodbye. - Bye. [engine starts] [poignant music playing] [sighs] [exhales] [brakes screech] Raúl! Raúl! Raúl, are you okay? What happened? They weren't dogs. [music swells] [bells tolling] [chuckling] You saw him, right? I was laughing in his face. I couldn't help myself. The guy dresses up as Santa Claus so he can drink for free. He goes, "Ho, ho, ho." Another beer. "Ho, ho, ho." Another beer. IN MEMORY OF VERÓNICA FORQUÉ [slow instrumental music plays] [uplifting instrumental music plays] [music ends]
