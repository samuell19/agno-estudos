I was watching videos on the internet the other night, I like to stay educated, you know? And I saw this one about octopuses. Turns out they have mini brains in each of their eight legs, allowing them to act independently of one another. And that gave me an idea. The OctoGames, eight games, eight players, one winner, each player acts independently, but are all part of the same game. My game, my totally sick. Totally epic. Totally awesome game. How sick is that, bro? Oh, that's harsh Can you turn that down. Name? Carrie Miller. Okay, sign here. What's a place this big doing in the middle of nowhere? It's JaxPro's studio. Wow, okay! Oh, your devices, please. Oh, uh... We'll return them to you at the end of the games. OK. Yeah, I get that this way. Alright. Thanks. Have y'all seen JaxPro yet? Don't bother, he barely talked to me. I'm focused. That prize is mine. We don't even know what it is yet. JaxPro is running this, so it's going to be huge. Maxine, I'm a comedian. Carrie, I'm a singer songwriter. It's nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Oh my gosh. Aren't you so excited? We get to be in the new JaxPro video. I'm just here to get more followers. Okay. What do you think? Oh, I'm going to win this. Is that so? Yeah. How hard can it be? Walt Brentwood. Entrepreneur. Carrie. You look like you'd be great at selling real estate. What? Hey, Moneybags. Switch with me. Who, me? What's up, guys? My name is JaxPro, and welcome to game one of the OctoGames. I hope you all found everything OK. You have each been invited here due to your promising social media presence. This is the first of eight games and only eight of you will move forward. Now you've probably seen the room is full of cameras. Once the games are over, everything will be uploaded to my channel for the world to see. What's the prize? Well, I was going to wait until after the first game to say but. Oh, come on! Boo! Come on! All right. After the games, I'll be retiring from social media. Wait, what? You can't! Whoa whoa! It's OK. It's all right because the winner is going to win all of my social media accounts, my sponsorships and my one hundred and fifteen million followers. So let's not waste any time. The first game is, Simon Says. Simon Says like the kids game? The game is simple. All players must obey any command, beginning with the words. "Simon Says", If I say, "Simon Says take a step" then all players must take a step. But if I say "jump" without saying, "Simon Says" first the players must not jump. If you do a command without "Simon Says" in front of it, you'll be eliminated. The last eight standing will move on to Game two. Good luck. This is the Eliminator. He will escort the losers out. You've gotta be kidding me! What is he, like a dog or something? Simon says. Clap once. Simon says. Touch your nose. Simon says, put your hand down. Put your hand on your head. Simon didn't say to put your hand on your head. Sadly, you are eliminated. No! No! Oh my god... Stay calm. Anyone attempting to leave will be eliminated. What's up, guys? I thought I made the rules clear. You never said you were going to kill us. Yeah, Simon didn't say speak. Only twelve players remain. Good luck, Simon says. Stand on one foot. Carrie. What? He's leaning against the wall. He's cheating. Simon says. Hold your breath. Oh, Jesus. Hey! Simon says the game is over. Congratulations. The eight of you were able to complete Game one. You've qualified for the chance to win my accounts. And my one hundred and fifteen million followers. Approach the camera and state your name and occupation. Anyone who disobeys will be eliminated. Carrie Miller, I'm a singer songwriter. I'm AJ_620. I'm a video game streamer. Maxine. I'm a comedian. I'm Ruth Martin, and I have the next big cooking show. Name's Stephen Randal. People call me "Squish" I'm a motivational speaker. Walter Brentwood, entrepreneur. Jess Hardbody I'm dedicated to helping people achieve their dream body through hard work, determination and focus. Kids, call me Ms. Sunshine. I make online content for children. Please follow me to the barracks. Today's footage, sir. Ooh, Simon says, thank you. Go. Luna! Honey, I got it. Luna, honey? Are you tanning? It's freezing! My followers want me tan! Oh my god... Well, I have the footage from Simon says. I cannot wait to see it all cut together. Gosh, honey, I am so excited to retire and run away with you. I can't wait to get fat. Oh, we're going to get so fucking fat with no one around to judge us. You'll finally, let yourself go bald and you'll stop tanning and the cold. We'll be hideous. Oh, you're so out of my league. Not for long. But like, how fat? Clothes. This is so surreal. I'm still in shock. You and everyone else. I gotta call, my sister. I gotta... Hey. You okay? I'm scared. Yeah, us too. I'm just a preschool teacher, I'm not going to make it far. Hey, the three of us, we'll stick together. Alright? Oh, please. Are you serious? This surprises you? This is the big time, honey. Famous people drink the blood of babies to stay young all the time. You really thought winning a hundred million followers would be easy? Good luck, sweetheart. Hey. Take a deep breath. Think about it, we're dead! Just breathe! Hey! In. Out. You're right. I've got this. I'm motivated, I'm driven, I'm fit. I can do this. We can do this. We're going to be all right. OK? What a bunch of stinkers am I right? Stinkers? Yeah. You and me. We're smart. We know stuff. Everybody else is just ruled by their emotions. Yeah, I'm not looking to make friends. You sure? I can start charming these ladies. Get us an advantage. Yeah? Think so? Dude, I could charm the panties off Mother Teresa. Yeah, I'm not looking to make friends. But I could use an ally. Maxine. Look. Here we go. Where are we? Lights on! Whoa! What's up, guys? Game number two is hopscotch. The rules are simple. First, you'll draw a number. That number will represent the order you'll go. Each player must hop across to win, but if the board turns red, you can't move. If you do move when the board is red, you will be eliminated. The game ends after the first elimination. Good luck, First contestant! Okay... How are you feeling? Good. Like I said, I'm a preschool teacher, hopscotch is my specialty. What were you whistling? You'll see. Next contestant. OK. All right. Here we go. That. What is that? Shh! Almost there. Almost there. Almost there. Almost there. You think she'll make it? Quiet! Trade with me. What? Why? You have the best number. I feel good about this. I'm trying to do you a favor. OK. Sure. Thanks. Next contestant. Yes! Yes! Send the flowers, she's done! She's done! She's done! Oh, yes! No, no, no, no, no! No! Stop! Please! Stop! No no no no! No! Stop! Please! Please, stop! Stop! Stop it, you're torturing her! That wasn't smart. I couldn't just let him torture her. You could have been killed. Hey. You were really brave back there. The hell do you want? Wait. Let him talk. Why'd you switch numbers with me? I told Squish I was on his side. I told him I'd get in with you for his benefit. So are you on our side? I'm on whose ever side helps me to take him down. How can we trust you? You can't. So what do you say? You in? You look like you could use a friend. Do I? Sure. You're a strong young man and that helps me in the games and I'm a woman and I might be able to help you in a different way. Really? Yeah. No. Hey, handsome. I have a question. Hey, I'm talking to you. Go away. I'm meditating. Leave me alone. You know, I've seen your videos before, all that motivational stuff you did after you got out of prison. It's empowering. Where are you going? Anywhere else. Hold on. I want to tell you about my cooking show, Why? Only one of us are going to make it out of here anyway. I have a cooking show and I have great ideas for cookware and kitchen items. If you don't leave me the fuck alone I swear I will beat the shit out of you. You can't do that. I'm a woman. It's never stopped me before. You really need to learn to control your emotions. Hey, are you OK? (Mumbling) I'm warning everybody right now do not fuck with me! Fucking jackass. I could have taken him. I just didn't see it coming. How? He warned you? Tilt your head back a bit. You seem to really know what you're doing. I was in med school before I was a gamer. Talk about a real downgrade, huh? I'm AJ, by the way, I don't think we formally met Maxine Carrie Sorry about your friend. This is ridiculous. We need to find a way out of here. Everyone, please prepare yourself for Game three Already? Tonight. Let's look for a way out. Deal. Hey, baby, What's up? Any missing persons reports yet? No, I have been texting the families, so no suspects anything. Oh, good. Good. You know, I really think this is going to be my masterpiece, the perfect way to go out. How long, do you think, until people realize it's real? Don't know, don't care. As long as we're on an island somewhere when it all happens. Two more days... Two... No, three more days. Oh, duh. Three more days. Right. Good work. What's up, guys? You can take your blindfolds off. Welcome to the obstacle course. This game, however, is optional. You guys have tugged at my heartstrings, so I wanted to give you a way out. The rules are simple make it to the end in under sixty seconds and you get to go home. No questions asked. Any volunteers? I'll do it. Bitch, I'm not going. Why not? You've had the shit beaten out of you If you think a little bruise is going to keep me from winning a hundred million followers, you've got another thing coming. Whatever. This is too easy. What's the catch? Your time starts now. There's the catch. You gonna do it? What? Are you kidding? No way. We got a game to win. I did it! I did it! The contestant has gone over the time limit. She's right. Would anyone else like to try? I'll go. What are you doing? I can do this. Don't you want to get out of here alive? I'm sorry. Carrie, this is suicide. And your time starts now. Wait, wait, wait. Help me understand This is a way out. It's risky, but it is a way out. And I want out. But I'm risking my whole life anyway, if I just go back to my stupid retail job and singing in bars, whatever, I get the chance to drunks who aren't even paying attention to me. It's a risk either way But something got us all here in the first place. Or I could stay here, and I can try to change things for myself and to have an audience of people who actually care to listen. Now that I've finally got my shot. I gotta fucking take it. Women, right? Wow! Only six contestants left. Now put your blindfolds on and you'll be escorted back to the barracks. Game four is up next. Hey Ready to bring the contestants back in? You understand any disloyalty will be punished by death. Jesus, again, with a loyalty thing? JaxPro saved my life. And he gave me millions. We all have our reasons. Hand it over. Listen, I'm here to do a job and do it well, so please... Why are you packing already? I'm just excited. Who's that? Just my mom. Ew. Gross. I'm going to go call her. Mm hmm. You got it? How much do I use? A teaspoon. Any more, and he'll taste it. Got it. When am I getting paid? He's cashing out after Game seven. That's what I'm going to do it stop by then. Got it. Thank you. It's my pleasure, believe me. Let's find a way out here. What about him? He hasn't moved in two hours. Something's wrong. This is our chance. Go check. What's up, guys? Welcome to round four of the OctoGames. Musical chairs. I think these are all going to be kids games. Kids games to have a winner and a loser, Walt. The rules are simple. There are five chairs and six of you, when the music starts, you'll walk in a circle around them. When the music stops, you must sit down in one of the chairs. Whoever doesn't is out. The first person out will be eliminated. After that, we will play to determine a winner. Speaking of winner, this game does have a prize. This winner will have one million dollars deposited into their bank account. Why would we want a million dollars if you're just going to kill us? Don't you guys have like families that would want it or something? May the best player win. AJ! AJ, no! No! All rise. Now to get that million. Split it with me if I get myself eliminated? How does fifty grand sound? Works for me. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. It's OK, it's OK. Fuck you. Fuck it. Whatever. Don't even try it. This is fun! AJ! You're OK. Barely, but yeah. Wait, what's going on? Hey, guys. So I wanted to make this game a little more interesting. Eliminating the first person, is a little boring, so I decided why not make winning this prize more intense? Two of you remain one of you will get the prize. The other will die. Good luck. Well, may the best man win. Bite me. We gotta take him down. Look, I'm not asking you to help me win, I'm asking you to help me stop him. I'm in. Me, too. Thank you. You won't regret it. I was wrong about you. Sorry. I know. There she is. Where am I? That doesn't matter, you impressed me back there. I wanted to meet you. JaxPro? In the flesh. Oh my God. No offense, but you're fucking crazy. And I like that. So I have a little proposition for you. I want you to help me with the rest of the games. Are you going to kill me? No, I'm going to hire you. Two million dollars. And once we're done, I'll let you go. I'm in good. And you know what? The fun is just beginning. Fifty grand. Man of my word. It was beautiful, Carrie actually thought I was doing her a favor. So how's that going, huh? Any new information? Not really. Just a bunch of ditzy kids, just like I suspected. So what's this I hear... about y'all trying to take me down? How'd you hear that? I didn't. Just a lucky guess. No, no. See what I was doing, I was... Listen, Walt. I will break your fat fucking neck if you betray my trust. You understand me? Yes, sir. Atta boy. I don't trust him. Don't have to. We just have to believe that taking down Squish is in his best interest. Which it is. I think he's playing the field. That can only backfire for him. He can't be that dumb. Oh my God. This is driving me crazy. I feel so hopeless. I mean, it's basically a hostage situation. I just wanted to boost my music career. This isn't your fault. You know that, right? I could have gotten out through the obstacle course. Hey, that thing was a death trap and you know it. I guess so. I really wish we had met on the outside of all this. We could have done, like, a project together or something. Put on your blindfolds and prepare for Game five. Who is that? Second half, we still good? Everyone take off your blindfolds. We need to find a way out of here. We should go for a window. The doors are probably locked. Let's just keep an eye out. And if one of us escapes we'll send help. Man, that new guard is kind of short. Looks like the old guard got left in the dryer. What, you don't recognize her? No, should I? What's up, guys? Welcome to Game five. Hide and seek. Only five of you remain. The rules are obvious You will have sixty seconds to hide anywhere in this house. After that, The Eliminator will try to find you the first person he finds is out. Good luck. 60, 59, 58, 57, 56, 55 Shit Maxine. Get over here with me. It's fine. I'll find somewhere else to hide. 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, Can I squeeze back there with you? I mean, you can try. Maxine. Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Thank you. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Ready or not, here he comes. No, no! Get the fuck out! Stop! What are you doing? Please. I'm sorry. What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? I'm so sorry. Hey, hey, hey. Look at me. It was you or her. Okay? You or her. You did good. Please. Please. Carrie! Maxine! Maxine! I'm so sorry, Maxine. What happened, Squish, crammed into the closet with me and Maxine and then he threw out when he heard somebody coming in. It's nothing personal. Someone has to lose. We're down to four. Carrie, I'm so sorry, it happened so fast. Go away. Ruth You were still breathing when they drug you out. I'm going to make sure you lose. So, game seven's coming up. Mm-Hmm. What's the plan? Well, we're going to cash out that night and then right after Game eight, we're going to upload the video and he's going to fly us out to the island. Good, good. How are things with Ruth? As if on cue. Hi! Ruth, this is my girlfriend. Oh, Luna Laughlin. Oh my God, you're just as gorgeous in person. You're so sweet. Come on. I'll give you the tour. Enjoy him while you can, honey. Hey. Good work, back there. Thanks. Final four. Happens when it's just you and me? Well, I guess the best man wins. I was almost out. If the guard didn't see you, you would have escaped, right? Right. That means there's holes in their design. We just have to wait for the next one. What if I'm not alive in the next one? Oh my god, will you quit your whining? Who the hell do you think you are? I'm just a guy in a game of life or death and treating it as such. You killed an innocent person. No, I didn't. He did. You're evil. You know? Yeah? Why? Because I'm fighting for my survival just like you? Because you only think about yourself. So you tell me, what do I get out of helping any of you? Right. This. Is my studio. Oh, wow, so this is where everything happens. What's up, guys? JaxPro here. Locked. Now... there is one more thing I'm going to need you to do for me. Anything for you. Today was your audition and you passed. Congratulations. This one was caught by another guard carrying cyanide most likely to try and kill me. You know what to do? Y'know we could just take our chances and run for it. They'd shoot us on sight. What if we rushed them? They can't take us all out at once. You rush them, I'll fight every one of you. The hell is wrong with you? I'm about to win this thing and everybody knows it. You almost lost the last game. Careful, Carrie. You remember what happened to Ruth? What's up, guys? Welcome to Game six, tether ball, a playground favorite. What's with all the kids games? Who do you think watches my videos? The rules are simple, hit the ball all the way around the pole and you win, we'll be playing three rounds of one on one tether ball AJ versus Walt and Carrie versus Squish. The losers will then play each other in the final round to determine who is eliminated. Still feeling so cocky? We will be playing Game seven later this evening and tomorrow we'll be playing the final game. Good luck. Oh, my God. God... Okay... first up is Walt and A.J.. Sorry we have to do this. I can see right through you. I don't know what it is you think you see, but I promise you, I want what you want. I know you killed Maxine. What? Why would I? Ah! Jesus! AJ, you got this. C'mon c'mon c'mon! Go, A.J., Come on. Come on, Walt. Come on, you can do this. Come on, keep going. Yes! Oh, fuck me! And that's for Maxine. The winner is A.J. Take that, Boomer. Next up is Carrie and Squish. For the record... Walt killed Maxine. Only because I told him to. That's not true. I guess it's your word against mine. Good job The winner is Squish. What the hell was that? Think about it. I could either lose to you, hurt my hands and then play Walt. Or... I could let you win. And play Walt with clean hands. You're not the only one who can play smart. That's not fair. That's what I'm talking about, that's playing smart. Next up is Walt and Carrie. Well, Nice knowing you, Walt. Goddammit... Carrie, please, no... you know, to do this to me, Carrie, please. Yes, come on. He's fucking done. Winner is Carrie. Please, please, no, I don't want to die. I see you're finally catching on. Good job. Give me one more game. I don't wanna die. Guys, do something! They're gonna kill me! Carrie... oh, Jesus Christ. Do something! No... You were supposed to I thought we had a deal. You were... What are you looking at? Whoa! That was a great game! Only three of you remain. Carrie, Squish, and AJ Game seven will be played later tonight. I'm so excited! What do we do now? All I know is that one of us is going to make it out of here alive. It's going to be you or me. How do you know that? Cause we're going to make sure Squish dies. What if it ends up being you versus me? We're not going to think about that yet. Honey, where's my G-fuel? It's coming. Thank you. Have you tried this? Oh, yeah, I hate it. But like this flavor? It's all gross to me. Every flavor? Come on. I've tried that one. No, you haven't this is a new flavor. Come on. Would you just take a sip for me? Why do you want me to try this shit so much? Because I like sharing things with the people I love. Sue me. Please just take a sip. I don't want it. Luna, try it. It's nasty. Try it or I'll hurt you. I just had Ruth kill a guard because they were caught carrying cyanide. Now I don't know if they were trying to fuck with the games or if they were trying to kill me or they were trying to give it to you. And if there's nothing in here, we have nothing to worry about. Get back here! You shot her. Yes. But when I stopped by to bring you the footage from the game, I heard you arguing upstairs. And so when she came down the stairs, I I just wanted to protect you, JaxPro, I... I didn't know what she was going to do to you. Give me the gun. Just to be sure. You did the right thing. I won't forget this. You might think what I've done is shocking to me, the OctoGames was the natural answer to the myriad of problems life had given me. Life and the internet treated me like a product to be bought and sold, like something to be watched rather than understood. So I held the OctoGames, a real life fight to the death where people are treated the way I was treated my entire life as product. Hmm. That's a hell of a suicide note. What now? I pack my bags and I leave the country after Game eight. Alone? I guess so. What about me? I'll pay you the two million tomorrow morning. You know that's not what I meant. We couldn't Why not? We're made for each other. Yeah, but you're, like, old and stuff. But we'll be on an island! No one can judge us. I guess that's true Better with someone old than no one at all. That might just be insane enough to work you like insane, remember? What's up, guys? Welcome to Game seven, Hangman. A classroom favorite. The rules are simple. We have a mystery phrase and each of you will take turns guessing one letter for each letter you get wrong you will receive a bigger and bigger electric shock. If you guess the phrase, you'll be released from your chair. The first person to stop breathing loses. This one's a fun one. You have two seconds per guess. Good luck. Squish. You're up. Time's up. T L F Wrong. Focus on the vowels. A E O I N Time! B Wrong. S D Wrong again He's bombing. It's not over yet. R Wrong. M Time. No, no, no, no, no, no. I'll solve it. Shock him No, wait, wait, wait, wait. Maxine lost the OctoGames. Shit. Congratulations. You can stand over there. Don't try anything. What do we do? There's no way out. What are you saying? You want to compete? I got this. Begin A Time. E AJ, what are you doing? Time. AJ, stop! I Wrong. Time. AJ, please! U No... Time. No, no. No no no no. Very good game, everyone. Such a tender moment. I'll see you all tomorrow morning for the final game. What do you want? May the best man win. Best man? You have cheated your way through this whole game. You have almost lost twice. You should be dead instead of. AJ instead of Maxine instead of all of them. You know, it doesn't really matter what you think. Right? You think this world belongs to you? To nice people, to people that play by the rules that bend over for the will of others? No. No. It belongs to us. Those that will do whatever it takes, even if it means throwing everybody else under the bus, that's who it belongs to. Wake up! You are going to die tomorrow. And I can't wait. Uh, I'm looking for Mr. JaxPro? You're looking at him. Oh. Are you... Are you... Mr. JaxPro, sir. Hi. It's an honor to finally see your face Okay just come in. Wow. Do you know why I called you here? Yes, sir. Oh. Why? Because during the, um... You wanted to Because you ruined the goddamn illusion during tetherball! I'm sorry. You let a boomer take off your mask. Do you know how un-scary your fucking face is? You're a fucking dweeb! What does that? The tattoo? Yes! Yeah, that's yours. I know it's my tattoo. Why do you have it? Because I look up to you. That... Eww! No! I'm a brand, you're nothing. I know. I'm sorry. Look, I know you hear this a lot, but I really am your biggest fan. OK? And I killed all those people, just like you asked. Did you enjoy it? Well, yeah, very much. You know, it's always been a fantasy of mine to kill someone. And... For a kid who never had anywhere to belong, who didn't want to end up like everybody fucking else in this shithole world, I'm sorry for cussing sir, but you gave me someone to be. So you decided to be me. That's fucking pathetic. Ruth! Wait, wait, no, no, Wait, please, please, no, no, JaxPro, please! Wait! No, no, no, no, no! What's up, guys? Welcome to Game eight, one of you will win it all. The other will lose their life as soon as this is over. Everything will be uploaded to my channel to be seen by hundreds of millions of people. They'll see what you've been through. The police will ask all sorts of questions, but I'll be gone. The final game starts now. Capture the flag. The rules are simple. The first person to hold the flag for three seconds wins. You cannot kill or knock out the other contestant. If you do, you will be eliminated. And remember, play smart. Good luck. Five. Four. Three. Two, One. Here goes nothing. Hey! Let go, Carrie. Everything I did was for this moment. You will not take this from me. He's going to knock her out. Wait. I have a clear shot right now. Not yet. You played well. Let it go. It's nothing personal. Congratulations! You're the official winner of the OctoGames! Hello? It's OK, it's OK, it's OK. You're safe now, You won. Where am I? Your new home. The video has been uploaded. The police will likely start an investigation. Carrie. What you do next is up to you. Wait. Who are you? Be careful. I'm still rooting for you. 911, what's your emergency? Hey, did you watch the song I just posted? Yeah, 200,000 views in one night, I mean, that's amazing. How do you feel? You mean... To be the OctoGames girl? Yeah, but people are watching. That's what she wanted, isn't it? I guess I really don't know anymore. Hey, did you see the video I sent you? No, not yet. Watch it and call me back. Ok. What is up, you guys, it is your boy, Chip Chip Chippy McDaniel here coming at you with another video. I'm here, girlfriend. Ruth! We're going to try candies from all over the world, including Japan! Kawaii! But first, we're filming from a secure compound. You know what's not secure? Your wi-fi at a...
