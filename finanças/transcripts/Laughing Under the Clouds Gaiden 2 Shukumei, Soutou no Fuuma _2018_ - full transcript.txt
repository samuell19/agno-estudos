Damn it. Isame! It's only a scratch. You go ahead. Drop your weapons. You must do what we say. You twins are cursed. We cannot let you live. You must obey the code. Be loyal to Fuuma. Drop your weapons. You run while I hold them off Not with my injury. You run. So you can live. One of you must kill yourselves. To save the other. You two have always been one. You were never twins. Nor unwanted children. We must respect the code. One of you must kill yourself. Or kill the other. Isuke. Isame. My sons! Mother. Damn you, Eishiro! Is that Father? You must run. Now! No! We must fight! Go! Now! Let's go. Damn it. It's my fault. I left the cave when you went outside. Now they know about us. Stop it. I should have stopped you. It's my fault. How's your leg? What if we never see Father and Mother... Stop. Mother? There you are. Run, Isame! Isame! You only bring evil. You're cursed and unwanted. You must die in order to save the clan. Isame! Isuke! - Mother! - Father! I'm so happy to see both of you alive. You're safe now. Those who knew your secret are gone. I'm so sorry. It was all my fault. I put us in danger. No, it was my fault. Hey, Isuke. Yes? - And Isame. - Yes? They told you to take your life. And they told you to kill the other. You put your own lives at risk first. Never thinking of sacrificing the other. You two have always been as one. Two of you make one. For one of you to live, you both live. You must always remember your love for each other. Just like you did today. Laughing Under the Clouds: Gaiden Destiny, The Double-Headed Fuuma Ouch! Two of us are no match to Isuke. Bummer. I thought I caught him by surprise. Will I ever be able to beat you? Your moves are too predictable, Mitsu and Itsuki. That's an unusual weapon. Did you make it yourself? Yeah. It fits how I throw. Really? Will it make that much difference? Here comes Nanao. Why isn't she at training? She hasn't been herself since the ceremony. She used to be happier. Her target? Her mother. You finally became a true Fuuma ninja. But you don't look happy. Isuke. Hey, over here! I thought I'd be happier. But the sensation of stabbing my mom still remains. I thought I left it all inside the dark box. Big Sis! I'm coming. I hope she'll never have to feel this. Damn... Isame, I'm coming in. Okay. How was it? The weight is good. And it throws perfectly. Then it was worth all my effort. What's wrong? Nothing. You look upset. Do I? Your face doesn't lie. A fellow ninja has been acting strange since the ceremony. Her target was her mother. I see. But you must endure the ceremony to be a ninja. Does it hurt? Not at all. It doesn't shake anymore. Don't worry. Isame, your meal is ready. Sorry I made you wait. You must be hungry. I didn't expect to see you here, Isuke. Father is looking for you. Okay. Eat while it's warm. Your hands are dirty. I can clean on my own. You have something on your face. Hey, Mother! Father. You have a mission. Yes, sir. Looks like he's safe. Yeah. What's wrong? Why more guards than usual? You know how the Chief loves to have more guards than necessary. We're surrounded! Protect the Chief! Let's go. Isuke! Stop him! Die. That's enough. Father? We got the scoundrel. You're a ninja. From where? Answer! I felt someone was stalking us. The stalker was one of us! You're a disgrace! Do it. Yes, sir. How many of you? What did you say? Speak up! - You bastard! - That's enough. I'm done with him. Take him out. Eishiro, kill him! You should have never become Chief. What did you say? We Fuuma ninjas are the kin of Master Orochi. His resurrection is approaching but your focus is elsewhere. Only on the ceremony. What's the point of killing each other? Are you sure you're serving Master Orochi? Can you swear that to all ninjas that lost their lives? You're a traitor who broke the code of Fuuma. You don't deserve to talk about Master Orochi. Kill him. Just kill him, Eishiro! I failed to protect our children from the pointless ceremony. It would have served me right if my son had killed me at his ceremony. I'm sorry... Just throw him out in the field. What are you doing? He deserves no respect... Father. Why did this man attack the Chief? Listen, Isuke. Yes? What's the purpose of Fuuma? To serve Master Orochi. Then what is your purpose? I'm also here to serve Master Orochi. That's what we were taught on this land. What's your true wish? I'm fully aware Isame and I owe our lives to the fellow ninjas you and Mother had to kill. I'll be a good ninja to make them proud. That's not your wish. That's duty. No need to take that on yourself. But... Isuke. What do you really want? My wish is to be with you, Mother and Isame. I want to lead a happy life here with my family. Good. Mother? What happened? Did you hit Mother? What am I? Am I her precious pet? Apparently Mother likes seeing how I grow up every day. How laughable. How I grow up every day? In this cave? I'm just growing taller. My life isn't for her. Tell me. Did you hit Mother? When I pushed her, my arm hit her. She tried to grab my tools. She doesn't want me to do anything related to ninja. You hit her for that? You have no idea how I feel. When I hand you the weapon I make every day, I'm overcome with envy inside. You're training and growing up to be a ninja. But I'm stuck in this cave. My hand still shakes. That doesn't give you the reason to hurt her. Don't, Isame! Get off me! You mustn't make the same mistake again. What did I do to deserve this? These will go through the ceremony next. No family members as their targets? That is... The one who killed her mother at the ceremony isn't doing well. Because she's a failure. My mission is to train strong ninjas. For that, I must let them kill those close to them. Rework their targets. Yes, sir. What do you really want? I want to lead a happy life here with my family. What did I do to deserve this? Isuke! What happened? A ceremony. What? Again? Why so often? Who did it? And the target? You did well. You survive the darkness in the box to be a true ninja. Don't waste this one's death. You must endure it. Will we be next? Don't you want to do it? Are you willing to do it? Of course I don't want to kill others. But it's a rite of passage for us. To be a true Fuuma ninja. Don't you think we were born at the wrong time? Kill a loved one and be locked in a box for seven days and seven nights. And take on the darkness. The Chief brought back the ceremony after he found it in an ancient text. Right. It's true that the ceremony makes us stronger. Do you two really want to be a Fuuma ninja? Of course. We have no other option. What about you? I... Isuke. I need to talk to you alone. Yes? Rikka... Why? No... I know it's stupid. Is that you, Isuke? Mother hasn't visited here since. Why are you here? We lost another one. At the ceremony. And? I told you about the girl who had to kill her mother. She was the target this time for her sister. Is that why you're depressed? Get a hold of yourself. Where is your commitment? Do you think you can kill? Of course I can. Even if your target is Father or Mother? That won't happen. Father and Mother are great ninjas. This land needs them. But I can kill others. I can kill even if my target is you. Because it's my duty to kill. You know because... I know! We owe our lives to those who have died before us. I must become a Fuuma ninja. But... Don't let others' deaths affect your mind. I don't want to see it! Go hide. Itsuki and Mitsu. What's going on? There was an explosion. We've been attacked. We must move the Chief to safety. You guard us! Yes, sir! Who's attacking? Who knows! Find the attacker. Who are you? The thief is right here! Chief! You must get him! Yes, sir! He's fast. Damn him. Isuke! You're one of us. For revenge? I must do this! Mother, what happened outside? I'm sorry I made you wait. What happened out there? Am I not allowed to ask what goes on outside? Mother? What exactly is going on? Father! Why? Why is this happening? I can't stop your bleeding. Father! Isuke, you must take my body back to them. And complete the ceremony. I'm sorry. I... I failed to change our lives. No! You said you want to lead a happy life with the family. Father... Your mother and Isame... You take care of the family. That boy, Isuke, will make a good Fuuma ninja. Yes. But I have some doubts. The masked attacker never got caught. And it was Isuke who went after that attacker. I noticed something when he brought back his father. It was in his gaze. You're now a true Fuuma ninja. You vow to serve me with pride. Yes, sir. - Keep an eye on them. - Yes, sir. Mother. I vow to always protect you and Isame in place of Father. Isame. Isuke. Is it over? Yeah. I'm starving. Didn't you eat the food? Of course not. How could I when you were suffering? I need to apologize. Don't let others' deaths affect your mind. You knew Father was your target. How despicable. "What do I really want?" Father asked me. Not as a ninja. But purely for myself. What I want is to be a Fuuma ninja. If that's what you want, I'll make it happen. Without any ceremonies. I'm going to change this land. So I want you to protect Mother. Father asked me to protect the family. But I can't protect Mother. Not true! I know how Mother feels. She'll never smile at me. Because she loved Father dearly. That's why... you protect her. What did you answer to Father's question? I want to lead a happy life with you, Father and Mother. That was my answer. I see. Hey, Isame. Keep this. As a memento of Father. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. You and I are one. I'll make your wish come true. And my wish... Isuke. You and I are one. What do you mean? Master Orochi is about to resurrect. Why aren't we doing anything? Please give us an order. No. Our focus is to perform ceremonies to create strong ninjas. We must focus on serving him and not killing each other. Shut up! We must keep performing ceremonies in order to protect Master Orochi. We don't have strong enough Fuuma ninjas to serve him! I will lead all of you the right way. All you have to do is obey me! I got trout today. Isn't that a treat? Thank you for this. Why don't you join and dine with me here today? Isuke. No, you are... As usual, the Chief refuses to listen to what others have to say. Why didn't you say anything, Isuke? I guess a rookie like you isn't allowed to talk back to him. Even if I say something, nothing will change. I agree with him that we need stronger ninjas for Master Orochi. But I don't like his tactics. His ceremonies. I'll eliminate them when I become Chief. Do you mean it? I'm counting on you. Same here. Did you hear something? Probably an animal. It's all rocks over there. Hey! Isuke! Mother! Stop! Mother! Get off me! I ordered you to get rid of one when they were born. How dare you hide one. Please do not hurt this boy. Cunning whore! Don't hurt her! Torture that cursed child, then kill him. Yes, sir. Please wait... Please save that boy. You can do anything to me. Okay then. You die now. Mother! Let me go. You must let me go. No! Let me go now, Isame! I'm so happy to see both of you alive. Kill him now. The cursed child must not live. Please wait! Please forgive him. We need Isuke. Please let him live. Shut up. Why? You ask why? Because they talked back to me. I decide which ninja lives! Unbelievable... Do we really kill each other for the good of Fuuma? You talk back to me now? My word is law! What you have to do is follow what I say. Will this really lead to Master Orochi's resurrection? I don't care about Orochi! Fuuma ninjas are my tools for protecting me. So you must obey me! And kill that child! Okay. You've fallen that much. It's time... for a new Chief. Chief! Kill him! Hurry up and... Do not retreat! You must die! You bastard... Isame. Hey, Isame! Get up. You have to get up. The Chief is dead. The two of us are the new Chief. The two of us make the 10th Kotaro Fuuma. Step forward if you object. Fuuma ninjas will serve Master Orochi to build a new future. The time of fear has ended. Isame, we shall rebuild our home, together. We shall. Things were supposed to go that way. Hey, you. Are you alive? Where did it go wrong? Tenka Kumou is dead. The most troublesome one is gone. Indeed. He was truly troublesome. I have my eyes on someone. It's time to act. Isuke. Are you and me one? What are you saying? The two of us make the Chief. I just asked if you and me are one. Now I realize how scared he must have been as he was tied in that box Scared of being abandoned. Father. Mother. Isame. He was more scared than I was. I'm still alive. I lost my brother. I failed with my mission. Do I still deserve to live? My mistake was ever meeting those people. It was a sweet dream. Who's there? Show yourself. I no longer have a reason to live. Chief. You're safe. My people... We're the only survivors. - Some of us are hurt. - We need your guidance. Please, Chief. Is that your child? Yes, he was born recently. I'm glad you're alive. Follow me. We must keep living. Find a hideout first. Yes, sir. You come with me. You and me are one. Directed by Tetsuya Wakano What are you looking at? The sky. It's too blue for my eyes. Are you missing the cloudy skies? It's not like that but I think of Shiga on cloudy days. I must make her cook this for me. Lady! Can I have 10 more skewers of mochi? Haven't you had enough? Soramaru, Chutaro and Shirasu, I'm doing just fine. How about you guys? What now? Are you serious? What the hell? Yes, I can provide information to you. Sounds good. You do that. I couldn't appoint a better man than you for the Orochi experiment. Sosei Abe.
