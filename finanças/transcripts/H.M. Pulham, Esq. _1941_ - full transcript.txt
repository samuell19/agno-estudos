Eight o'clock, Ellen. Goodbye, dear. Goodbye, dear. No, Mitzi. This isn't Sunday. So you can't go. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Seventeen. Eighteen. Twenty-five. Good morning, Mr Pulham. - A splendid morning, Joe. Thank you. Morning everyone. - Good morning, sir. Good morning, Miss Rollo. - Morning, Mr Pulham. 'Edridge and Mason'. '341 Main Street. This city'. 'Attention. Mortimer J. Eldridge'. 'Dear sir. We received your reply of the 6th instant'. Hello? Yes. This is Mr Pulham's secretary. Mr Brown. He wants to speak to you personally. Brown? I know lots of Browns. Did he give any other name but Brown? What Mr Brown please? The name is Rodney. I don't know him. Ask him what he wants. - He seems to know you. Perhaps he is someone you play squash with. Hello. Who is it? - Is that you, Harry? What's the matter with you? It's Bo-Jo. Bo-Jo Brown. Oh yes. Sure. How are you, Bo-Jo? Too busy to talk to old friends? No. Of course not. A little mix-up here. Didn't get your name straight. How are you, Bo-Jo? - Fine. How are you? I'm fine too. Haven't seen you for a while. Why don't you ever call me up, Harry? Well, you know the way it is. Yes. The same with me too. I'm so pushed around I never see people I want to see. What are you doing for lunch today? For lunch? Nothing. - That's swell. How about coming up to the Downtown Club where we can talk? 12:30. How about it? I'd love to, Bo-Jo. - 12:30 sharp. Alright. I'm having lunch with Mr Brown at the Downtown Club. That was Bo-Jo Brown. All American tackle. We went to Harvard together. Yes, sir. I want to propose a toast. To the best darned class that ever was. And to the one that will have the best darned 25th reunion there ever will be. Because you and I and all of us will make it that way. Toss off the drinks, fellows. Let's have lunch. Naturally, there will be a ballgame and a men's dinner. What's bothering me is the final entertainment. The one the whole class takes part in. Wives, kids and everybody. Last year they had a band playing popular tunes. They all sang the old songs and everybody had a swell time. Except some of the kids got lost. We are going to recapture something of the old days. Doesn't everyone agree that his happiest time ever was his four years at Harvard? Ours is the best darned class that ever came out of Harvard. We had one of the best darned pudding shows I ever saw. You remember Spotty Gray doing his tightrope act? We have to get Spotty in the show. Spotty Gray just passed on. - Passed on where? Passed on the year before last. Left a wife and four children. And only five thousand dollars in insurance. I remember. But that's beside the point. The main problem as I see it, is to get everybody into the proper spirit. I don't know of anything that makes people happier than a darned good fight. Two good game boys on a platform right in the middle of Harvard yard. Pasting each other. It will drive everyone crazy. Take them out of themselves. They won't know where they are. Chris, get busy and ask Ron about talent in the class. Tap dancers. Saxophones. We must have lot of good stunts. You figure this out amongst yourselves and we'll get together again real soon. I've had a swell time and I hope you all have too. Goodbye, boys. - So long, Bo-Jo. Harry. He thought he'd get off easy. You're coming with me, boy. Come along now. Goodbye, boys. It's a great life, isn't it? I never realised we were all that old. A fine way to talk. We're not old. - We're in our middle forties. I'm just as good as I ever was and so are you. But I see what you mean. Those other fellows looked terrible. They don't take care of themselves. Not enough exercise. Too much worry. Maybe they have to worry. - No-one has to worry. Look at me. I never worry. Here's your little job, Harry. You're going to be responsible for getting out the class history. Contact each of your classmates and get his life. Bo-Jo. I haven't the time. Besides, I know nothing of my classmates' lives. Take the time. Take off your coat and spit on your hands. It's easy. Here's samples from last year to give you the idea. Put down some important facts and then make a few remarks. It's as simple as ABC. You'll be fascinated. So long. I am late. It's a boy, sir. Good. I had hoped so. Hugh. Read this over to me in case they can't read my writing at the telegraph office. 'The headmaster's office. St. Swithin's School'. 'Gerrards Cross. Massachusetts'. 'Confirming conversation'. 'Kindly register my son Henry Pulham In class twelve years hence'. Get started right away, Hugh. - Yes, sir. Someday you will be grown up and I want you to be a gentleman. In life it is sometimes puzzling to know what to do. You will know if you've been taught to be a gentleman. Yes, father. I know you're going to have a fine time. But if you don't .. Be certain not to let anyone know of it. - Yes, father. I guess that's about all. Goodbye. St. Swithin's. If you get the most from it, boys. It will mean something to you always. While you are here. You will find there are a great many things you will have to do. Without asking why. You must learn first to obey and serve. There. Feeling better now, Pulham? Yes, sir. - That's the man. You did not flinch. You stood there in the line. That's what makes a man. Yes, sir. You'll be proud of this tomorrow. You won't hurt tomorrow. I'd like to tell you something. And don't forget it ever. Yes, sir. - Now. Theodore Roosevelt. At times, I confess he is too radical for me. Once wrote something that I would like written in the mind of every boy. I'd like it written in the minds of my boys when they are men. Are you listening, Pulham? Yes, sir. 'Hit the line hard'. 'Don't foul. Don't shirk'. 'But hit the line hard'. Remember that, Pulham. Remember that. Yes, sir. Mrs Ransome telephoned. She asks you call her when you return to the office. What did you say? A Mrs Ransome telephoned. She asked that you call her when you return. Ransome? I don't think I know any Mrs Ransome. 'Mrs John Ransome'. She stays at the Hadley. What does she want? - For you to call her when you came in. Alright. Get the Hadley and see if she's there. I met a Mr and Mrs Ransome on the way to Europe. A man named Ransome gave me a bid on putting in a septic tank. Hello. This is Mr Harry Pulham. I am not really speaking, am I, to H.M. Pulham esquire? This is Harry Pulham. Don't you know who I am? It's probably the telephone. Perhaps it's a bad connection. No. It's Marvin. Marvin Miles. Marvin? - Yes. Are you trying to pretend you don't know me? What in the world are you doing in Boston? I'm here on business until Thursday. You didn't know me, did you? Yes. Of course. It's just that .. You came out of nowhere. Don't you want to see what I look like? Yes. I would like to, Marvin. I would love to. Then meet me at 5:30 for a cocktail. I'll be waiting for you downstairs. In the Fiesta Room. I have to go out to dinner. - But not at five-thirty. No. - Harry. Are you happy? - Happy? Why, yes. Of course I'm happy. I am glad. Ever so glad. It will be strange, won't it? You will be there at five-thirty? I'd love to, Marvin. The Fiesta Room at five-thirty. No. I will remember it. The afternoon mail and the closing prices. Check your hat, sir? What? Yes. Thank you. She's still as beautiful as ever. My life is well-ordered. Well managed. I am as happy as the average man can hope to be. My hat please. Good afternoon, sir. I want two dozen very large American Beauty roses. We'll have to send out for them, sir. American Beauties aren't as popular as before. And they'll be two dollars apiece. Alright. Want a card to go with them, sir? Yes. They go to Mrs John Ransome at the Hadley. Ransome. I'd like a gardenia. A big one. I'll take the gardenia with me. - Just a minute, sir. Shut up, you fool. I am the same fellow who left here this morning. I wish I hadn't run away so early. How did it go? Gracie. You wasn't such a fool as to invite that horrible man to the Lesters. But Margaret knows better than that. Hurry, dear. You're awfully late. They expect us at 7:30. There's plenty of time if my shirts are back from the laundry. Ellen was looking for your studs. We can't find them anywhere. If that girl sent my studs to the wash again .. Sardines? Kay, I think you could talk to Grace some other time. Be quiet, dear. It's only Harry, Gracie. The age-old hunt for studs. Yes. If she's so intelligent, why do you suppose she never says anything? Personally, I don't see why Jerome ever married her. He is a perfect nitwit. Well, if you come right down to it .. Why does anyone marry anyone? Come, boys. Select your partners. Quite a bunch of pills today. Quite a bunch of pills. I see a peach. So long, Harry. - So long, Joe. Excuse me. Here is a nice little boy. This is Kay Motford. How do you do. May I have this dance? - Certainly. Where do you go to school? St. Swithin's. Do you like dogs? - Yes. I've got a dog. A cocker. His name is Flopsy. Don't try to slide so much. Keep time to the music. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. Yes. Well, I will call you. Alright, Gracie. Goodbye. Harry, don't stand there like a goof. You are late. Is that for me? How sweet of you. Now, run along. What were you and Ruth Quiller talking about? About sex. Don't see she has to talk about it at the dinner table. Her husband is a psychiatrist. Why don't you throw away ten or fifteen of those old keys? I have no trouble finding the one I want. Hurry up. The kitchen stove is still leaking. You forgot to call the plumber again. Alright. Alright what? Alright. I'll call him tomorrow. Be sure to take Mitzi out for a while. Ellen may have forgotten. If I'm a sleep when you get back, undress in the bathroom. And try not to stumble over things. - Alright. Goodnight. - Goodnight, dear. [ Dog barking ] Shut up, you fool. It looks like a tombstone, doesn't it. Maybe I am dead and I don't know it. What are you thinking about? About my life. Harry, aren't you happy? Yes. Of course. Is anything bothering you? No. Of course not. What makes you ask? You've acted so strangely all evening. Is it alright if I sometimes just sit and think? Yes. I suppose so. Goodnight, dear. Night. Come on. You know something, Mitzi. I don't take you for a walk. You take me. You pretty much select the time and place and I follow obediently. Come to think of it, haven't I been doing that all my life? Are you happy? Yes. Of course I'm happy. I said it just like that. But I wonder if I am. Great Scott, I wonder if I have ever been. Of course, I went to Harvard. We were on Dartmouth's 30-yard line. There was Swanson at left half and Bates at right end. Max called the play through me. He always calls it through me when he wants first stop. I got that big slob right off his feet and we gained five yards. We'd have made ten yards, Sam, if you'd been carrying the ball. No, Bo-Jo, I don't think so. Just then, I felt Swanson come smashing into the back of me. [ Door knocks ] Come in. Is Harry Pulham in here? Thanks very much. I'd like to discuss it with you sometime. Bo-Jo, do you know Bill King? - How are you, King? I'll wait for you in your room. - No. Sit down. Sit down, Bill. The whistle blew. The play was over. I stood there perfectly relaxed. When he pulled my leg and I went right down top of him. How do you mean, he pulled your leg? Don't you understand English? I started to step over him and he grabbed my leg. He got me off balance. My ligaments went and I sat down on his head. I could feel the whole leg going just because I wasn't ready for it. Well, do you know what he did then? What? - He bit me. That's what they do at Dartmouth. He bit you? - You don't believe it. Well, his teeth marks are still there. I'll take down my pants if you don't believe me. Come on, somebody. Help me take down my pants. It's all black and blue. I count sixteen teeth. I count eighteen. That's the way it is, fellahs. I don't know what will happen now with Yale tomorrow. Here comes the team. How's it going, Bo-Jo? - Alright, coach. I brought the boys to see you. Well, men. Here is Bo-Jo Brown. I guess we all know how we feel about him. We all know he's not going to be in there with us tomorrow. We know what that means. There is one thing I want you men to do. I want you to shake his hand and tell him we'll beat the living hades of Yale. Whether he's in there or not. Alright. Shake hands. Would you like to say something to the boys, Bo-Jo? All I can say is. Give it to 'em, fellahs. Give it to those Elis. Well, men. We all know how we feel. How about it? Hard luck for poor old Elis. Come on the blues. Now altogether. Attack them and break through. That's something I'll never forget. I won't forget it either. It makes me want to regurgitate. What do you mean? It makes me want to heave. You .. - Now wait. Before you say anything, wait and see if there's anything to cry about. Bo-Jo Brown isn't about to die, is he? If we don't beat Yale tomorrow what difference does it make? It's only a football game. You low skunk. If you don't like what I say we finish it right now. He doesn't really mean that, Joe. You're just trying to get a rise out of us. Aren't you, Bill? You know I am right. Both of you really know it. Goodnight. Why don't you say something? I'm thinking. I wish we had him as St. Swithin's. I wish the skipper had heard him. We'd have paddled his tail off. - I guess we would have. There's a lot of radicals all over that don't get anything out of college. They just don't know what it means. Hello Hugh. Come in, Bill. Good morning, Master Harry. Morning, sir. - Hello. You look tired, Master Harry. You must have studied hard all week. I'm not tired, you old faker. You had better have some spirits of ammonia before your father sees you. You've no idea how you look. A horrible sight. Hugh is always that way. Don't pay any attention to him. I don't look badly, do I? It must have been quite a party with Joe Brown last night. Did you have much to drink? - Harry. Harry dear. Darling. But you look so tired. Mother, I am not tired. Mother. This is Bill King. We're very happy to have you here with us, Mr King. Sometime we think Harry tries to conceal us from his friends. Do you conceal your mother from your friends? My mother is dead. Sit down by me, Harry. Do sit down, Mr King. Mr King, do you think Harry has been working too hard? He has been studying a good deal. - Now, Harry. Mr King, I am so sorry you lost your mother. Mothers mean so much. Harry and I have always been such friends. You don't have to tell me what you were doing all week because I know. Mrs Motford tells me you danced with Kay twice on Friday night. And now I have a surprise for you. Kay is coming to lunch. Coming to lunch? Coming to lunch here? You look as if you weren't pleased. I don't see what gets into boys. Do you know Kay Motford? No, ma'am. Afraid not. - She is such a dear. A dear, sensible girl. She doesn't think about herself or her looks. She just thinks about other people. I am sure she must be very nice. What are we waiting for? Hello Harry. Where's lunch? Where is Mary? Mary. Mary. John. This is Mr King. - How do you do, Mr King. How are you? We're waiting for lunch. Kay Motford's coming. Who the blazes is Kay Motford? A friend of Harry's. You know Kay. Cecil Motford's girl. She isn't a .. She isn't any friend of mine. I happen to know her. That's all. She isn't a friend of yours but you ask her to lunch. Come now. I didn't know she was coming to lunch. If you ask me, Kay Motford is a lemon. Then why is she coming to lunch? - I don't know why. Except mother asked her. Well, what's all the fuss about? Where is the sherry? Where's Hugh? Hugh. Hugh. - John. I guess Harry and Mr King are old enough to have a glass of sherry. All the boys drink at Harvard, don't they, Mr King. Some of them. This is my sister Mary. This is Mr King. Pleased to meet you. Harry's girl comes to lunch today. Look here, if you want to know what I think of Kay .. Good day, Miss Cornelia. - Hello Hugh. Is everyone in the drawing room? - Yes, Miss Cornelia. Go right in. Hello Mr Pulham. Kay, darling. Mary. - Hello. Sorry I'm late. - Alright. I've been out walking with the dog. Mr King, I want you to meet Miss Cornelia Motford. Miss Motford. Pleased to meet you. - How do you do? Do you like dogs, Mr King? Yes, ma'am. Harry. You look awful. Why did you say Kay Motford was a lemon? She is, isn't she? You must be crazy. I'd cut in on Kay Motford at any dance anytime. I wouldn't be afraid of being stuck with her either. Darling. Please come to bed. Just a few minutes, dear. I guess it would be showing off to say I was decorated. Besides, it wasn't much that I did. Morning. Morning, Captain. I saw your signal. Do you wish to speak to us? It is you who should be waving a flag. You are caught. We're ready to punch you out. Yes. I know. - It's hopeless for you, my friend. Why waste lives? Go with your hands up. You mean surrender? Yes. Hopelessly. It's kind of you to suggest it, but .. I couldn't do anything like that personally. Of course I might ask some of the men. I suppose it would be fairer. I'll give you five minutes. Let them come with their hands up. You shall come too, my friend. It will be much more comfortable. I appreciate what you say Captain but .. I could not do that. Cigarette? It's hot even for August, isn't it? Yes. It is very hot. It is understood then? Five minutes. Thank you for the cigarette. Might as well have the pack, Captain. Looks like you'll have more use for it. Danke Schoen. Sergeant. They are giving us five minutes to surrender. If any of the men want to go over, they can. I think the right thing to do is to stay here with anyone else who wants to. Listen bums. Any guys with yellow bellies can walk out right now. Right over to them. The Lieutenant says he likes it better here. Pulham don't want to live forever. Come on, all cry-babies. Front and center. Attaboy, Lieutenant. Yeah. Who said Lieutenant Pulham wears lace drawers? That will do men. I am very much obliged. We have a minute and a half. Alright. Move up there. Watch those planks. Here they come, men. Well, go ahead and tell me how you won the war. I'd rather not talk about it. Okay, kid. Funny how some of you fellows act when you first get back. Don't worry. You'll get over it in a week or two. I suppose so. I called the family. I knew I didn't want to hurry back to Boston. I couldn't seem to face going home. I can't explain it. I suppose it's the war. You don't have to explain it. The war has taught people it's not worth living if you can't do what you want to. You were given everything and what did it amount to? You were brought up in a certain tiny segment that will be non-existent. Take the insect world. Insects haven't got brains. They just react. Their environment changes and their reactions don't work and .. Boom. That's the end of the species. Now, you're an insect with very old-fashioned reactions. What about you? Me? I'm changing over just as quick as I can. And it's much easier for me because I've not had the intensive training you have. I've not been in your hive of bees. You used to like our beehive. - Sure. Yeah. I liked it. A nice comfortable beehive. But they can smoke it out. I like your father and mother fine. Like all the other bees. But Harry, you have to get out of there. I tell you what you do. Go back home and tell them you got a job. I'll get you one. I'll get you one tomorrow. Where can you get me a job? Where I'm working. The biggest advertising agency in New York. J.P. Bullard Inc. I'm in strong with Bullard. Have a cigarette, Mr Pulham. - No thanks. He doesn't mean that. He'd like a cigarette. Will you? Pull up a chair for Mr Pulham. - Yes, sir. William tells me that you would like to work for us. I hope you noticed the preposition. 'With us'. Not 'for us'. We all work together here. One great big team. That's exactly what I was telling him last night. A great big team. Has he seen Walter Kaufman yet? What is Walter's reaction? - I'll get him. Mr Pulham. Let me ask you a question. What do you hope to be doing ten years from now? Ten years from now? Walter. This is Mr Pulham. - Hi, Pulham. Walter, just playing with words. What is your immediate reaction to Mr Pulham? You mean, without any thought? - Just a snap judgment. There is something basic there. Nothing like an immediate reaction. Today is Wednesday. You might talk to Mr Pulham, Walter. And have him come on Monday. Come with me, Mr Pulham. Thank you, sir. - Good day, Mr Pulham. But they can't hire people that way. Can't they? Here's the Copy department. It's where we work. Don't stick your nose out without me. No-one need see much of you for a time. Well, here's our cell. What am I going to do? Didn't I tell you? That's right. I didn't. You are .. You are my assistant. You're going to follow me around and carry my tools. Thank goodness there's no room for anybody else. Is that marine to come in here too? The whole US Army is camping here. This is Harry Pulham. Marvin Myles. Pleased to meet you. It's all new to Harry. Is he another of J.P.'s ideas? Have you seen what's just been sent in? That Yale boy with the squint is going around tacking them up. 'Let each word, however humble, be an arrow pointed by the barb of thought'. 'Feathered with the wings of beauty'. I am responsible for the big thought of today. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. I can't stand any more on an empty stomach. Look that over, will you. See you later I suppose. What does she do? Women's copy. I never saw a girl do that before. That is, a nice girl. Do what? Paint and powder herself in public. This isn't public. I guess it isn't. Well. Let's go to lunch now. Afterwards, I'll see you to your train. Mr Harry, it's certainly nice to see you back again safe and sound. Thank you, Tilly. - Going down. Have a cigar? No thanks. I've never smoked them. - You will. There's nothing like a good cigar when things aren't going quite straight. I'll fill my pipe. Your decision to work up in New York will be quite a shock to your mother. To stop her being too upset .. You should promise to spend some time at Westwood with us no matter what happens. I'd want to do that, sir. Whether I promised or not. Harry. Don't call me 'sir'. You've been around a lot more than I have. Mr Pulham. The papers from the Armitage estate. Mr Pressley sent them over. Good heavens, these Armitage papers are never straight. Take them out. Have someone else do it. I can't be bothered with it now. In the 26 States east of the Mississippi river. There are 23 thousand nine hundred and 42 men's washrooms. Nine thousand six hundred and eighty use liquid soap. 7,222 use powdered soap. 3,102 use old-fashioned cake soap. And the rest don't use any soap. Amazing. Absolutely amazing. Pulham, Mr Kaufman wants to see you. You suppose he's going to fire me? Of course not. Just act as if you're in a hurry. No, no. It simply does not convey the idea. For one thing you can't see the buttons and the stitching. May I ask if you can see the detail of buttons on a coat at such a distance? We're not paying you for distance. What do you want? I was told you sent for me. Yes. Just a minute. Sit over there. But it does not express anything. Come here. Take a look at that picture. Here's a very new reaction, Ellsmere. What do you think when you see that picture? I don't know, sir. I don't know what you mean. That answers, doesn't it? He sees a picture you charge us $1,000 for and doesn't know what it means. Perhaps he hasn't any brains. Do you suppose that the average person who sees this picture has any brains? We're not trying to be intellectual, Ellsmere. Look. Put a girl beside him. Have him look at the coat. Take the flag from his hand and put his hand in the roomy pocket. Have it snowing. If you want to do business with us you gotta think. And remember. It's not the girl, it's the coat. Alright. Take it away. Now let's see. Where were we, Miss Myles? Yes, yes. A quick cross section of reactions. Something warm, something human. Now explain it to Mr Pulham so I know you got the right idea. Do I have to take the marine along? Go ahead, Miss Myles. It's from the survey for Coza soap. Knock on the door. Ring the bell. When the door opens Mr Pulham puts down the bag so it's hard to close the door. Now. Explain your approach. Then I say: 'Good morning'. 'I haven't come here to sell anything'. 'I have a remarkable new soap'. 'I want to give you some to try'. Soap. Go ahead, Miss Myles. Then I say. 'I wonder if you have a moment if you can give me something soiled to wash'. Do I have to do that? It will be a great experience for you. Make it informal. A great big party. Lots of fun. Ha-ha. But notice the consumer's reactions. It's the home atmosphere I want. You follow me, Pulham? You mean we're going to knock on somebody's door and ask if .. We can wash something? I'll tell him all about it as we go along. If the suitcases and packages are ready, we start right away. Any of them will do. I will try Frenkel. Shall I go ahead? - No. You'd better not. What is it you want? Morning, madam. I haven't come to sell you anything. I just a want a chance to convince you with a little demonstration. Please go away. Mr Frenkel is not at home. Madam, I just want to give you some of our amazing new product to try. Get out of here or I call the police. I'm telling you. Mr Frenkel is not at home. Now, Mrs Frenkel. I don't blame you for being suspicious. It's not often someone appears at your door asking to wash your dirty linen. But that's what we want to do. A little washing for you. That is all, Mrs Frankel. Washing? - Yes. Come in. What a lovely apartment you have here. We simply want to enlist your help in a home survey of our new soap flake. In exchange, we're willing to do a little washing for you. Now, if you show me the laundry. 'The laundry', he says. You mean the sink. Here's some socks. Thank you. Come on. Let me do those. Don't be silly. When I was overseas I wore socks from Boulogne to the Rhine and back. What's the matter? Am I doing it wrong? Mrs Frenkel didn't know there was anyone like you. Neither did I. If you want to go crazy, we can all go nuts. That is fine, Mrs .. You can go home now if you want. I can handle this. I am used to it. There must be something I can do. In the morning you can go over the grammar of all this. And give to Kaufman's secretary to make a clean copy. Well, goodnight. See you in the morning. No. I'm going to see you safely home. Don't be silly. - You shouldn't be out alone so late. Oh? What do you think I generally do? I'll have a car of my own someday. With a chauffeur waiting outside when I work at night. And I will have a mink coat and a French maid. And I'll invite you up for dinner. Be sure to wear a white tie as there will be lots of interesting people. All are writers and artists and people on the stage. I'll be a partner in an agency by then. You see, I know where I am going. Yes. I know you are. Will you come up? - No thanks. I'll just see you get in alright. Strangely enough, I have my key. Well, goodnight. Goodnight. Sir Galahad. It's strange, isn't it? Things that seem important in life are not what you put in a class biography. Who gets the Martini? - The lady. Old-fashioned? A Scotch and soda here. My three musketeers. Mr Bullard. - No. Please. Pulham, I had no chance to speak to you at the office. If you don't mind I'll call you Harry. I am going to call you Harry because you've made the team. You earned your letter. Today. The soap of tomorrow. Sit down, Mr Bullard. - No thank you. I don't believe in talking shop outside office hours. I just wanted to compliment all of you on our successful campaign. William thought of the general idea. It was at the back of my mind all the time but happy to give him the credit. Then Miss Myles contributed the customer appeal. And you came through with your slogan. With the brilliant suggestion that soap emulsifies. Yes, Harry. You were given the ball to run with and you put the ball over. Well, have a good time in Boston. Keep on pitching for Coza. I will, sir. What did I tell you? We hit him right in the solar plexus. Charlie. How are you? A big-shot gangster. Look, if you are going to pack we'd better step on it, kid. Check please. Look. You don't mind if I don't go along? I got a business appointment. No. Marvin will see you off. Won't you? - Certainly. And remember me to your family. Especially Kay Motford. - Alright. I will. Goodbye, Bill. - So long, kid. The Winter Garden stage door. I always wondered what your room looked like. It doesn't surprise me a bit. I'll help you pack. You're sure to forget something. You really think it's alright for you to be up here? You mean my reputation? Alone in a man's room at night? It does sound silly when you put it that way. We can leave the door open if it makes the landlady happier. No, that isn't necessary. - No? I don't know what you like at all outside the office. Who is this, your mother? Yes. That's mother. And that's your father? - Yes. Who is this girl? Somebody you haven't told me about? I told you about her. That's my sister, Mary. Those are the officers in my regiment. Who are these boys? Members of the Zephyr Club. My club at Harvard. All of you is there, isn't it. All you are going back to. It must be queer being in two places at once. I don't know what you mean. I'm not in two places at once. I wish you were coming along. What would they think of me if you brought me? They would like you. Once they understood you. What is there to understand? Nothing really. It's just that .. After you're used to one type of person all your life. You judge everyone else by that type. You wouldn't understand them either. Maybe I would. I understand you. Boston midnight. Harry. You are coming back, aren't you? Of course I am. I'll be in the office 9 o'clock Monday. You're sure? Of course I am sure. Don't let them take you away. All aboard. Goodbye. I married your mother when I was young. I've never regretted it. The main thing about marriage is to find the same sort of person that you are. I haven't thought about getting married. - That's alright. All of a sudden you'll see that life is not right without it. I remember the first time I thought about getting married. Give me the same old club. I'll try it once more. I never did like that mid iron. Someday, I'll break it in two. You looked up on that shot, sir. - I suppose I did. What was I talking about? The first time you thought of marrying. - Yes. I thought of it when I was sitting in a barrel in the marshes shooting duck. I was just sitting there looking over the pond and I realized I was all alone. And I should be doing something for someone. Then I thought about your mother. You'll get the same idea sometime. It will come over you all of a sudden. I haven't got it yet. But you will. A good thing to be prepared for it, Harry. A good thing to be thinking about the right sort of girl. I've always liked the Motfords. Look. Honestly, father. I'm not interested in Kay Motford. I don't want to marry her. - Someone like her. That's all. Give me a niblick. I suppose the house looks old-fashioned to you. But I've never wanted to change it. I'm glad I haven't, now everything is changing. Good morning, Dan. - Morning, sir. Good morning, Mr Harry. There are some things I like to think are going to last for quite a while. Such as common decency and civilisation. And human liberty. You know what I mean. Things we don't talk about but feel. You get it in a good quote. Scott and Thackeray. And in what I can understand of Shakespeare. I never quite thought of it in that way before, sir. We like to think we're going to be remembered. We don't like to see everything we believe in. Changing. And I know it isn't going to. You and everyone else will settle down because certain values can't change. Harry, what the devil is it you do in New York? I've been helping with a big campaign. Advertizing soap. Thunderation. You can't like anything like that. I like it because something is happening all the time. And I've spent all my life trying to fix it so things wouldn't happen. What else do you do in New York? We generally work late and I'm pretty tired in the evening. Then you'd better make up for lost time. You'd better see all your old friends. The Binghams have asked you to lunch. And we're having a big dinner at the club tonight before the dance. What's the matter, Harry? Nothing, sir. - Then don't look like that. I want people to know that you're alive and at home where you belong. Mother is asking for you. Alright. I will see you later, sir. Give me a cigarette. Are you allowed to smoke? - What do you think I am, fifteen? Harry. Don't you like us anymore? What under the sun makes you say a thing like that? I don't know. Maybe a brother and sister can never know each other. It would be fun if we did, wouldn't it? I could talk to you about boys and you could talk to me about girls. Perhaps if we got drunk together we could say what we really thought. Look here, Mary. Oh well. In case you don't know. Mother is going to try to make you stay here. Yes? Good morning. We're ready to see you. But we mustn't talk about anything too exciting. How is mother? - We're doing very well. We've been talking about our soldier boy ever so often and waiting for his visit. But we must only discuss happy things. Darling. Hello mother. Isn't he beautiful, Miss Percival? Now do you see why I'm proud of my boy? Yes. We're very proud of our boy. But you mustn't talk to him for more than a few minutes. Darling. You must enjoy yourself while you are here. You're going to Kay's for lunch tomorrow, aren't you? In the afternoon, go down to the beach and see all your old friends. Don't worry about me, mother. I'm having a fine time. It's just that .. - Just what, dear? It's just as though I'd never been away. There you are. Did you have a good time? Yes. I had a fine time. You're not serious about going back tomorrow? I have to be in the office Monday morning. When are you going to stop all this confounded nonsense? It won't do any good to argue. Alright. We won't go over it again. But I am hanged if I know. I don't know what's getting into everybody. Perhaps around October you will feel differently. If you are back around October and your mother is feeling better. Perhaps we could go out after woodcock. When you were born I thought I would have someone to take shooting. Funny, isn't it? Nothing turns out the way you think it will. I wish you wouldn't say that, sir. - But it's true. All the things you take for granted. There they are. And they're gone. There you were. And now you're gone. I don't know how it happened. We had a good time playing gold anyway, didn't we? I don't know, Harry. I don't suppose I know much about anything. But just remember I have sense enough to realise it. That's why I'm not arguing with you. I wish you wouldn't say that, sir. You make me feel .. - I can't help the way you feel. And you can't help the way I feel. I guess neither of us is very bright, Harry. So we'll just have to worry on as best we can. Goodnight. - You're not angry with me? No use talking. I never was any good at talking. Hello. You made it. It seems so, doesn't it. And you don't look any different. I kept thinking you'd look different. Where is Bill? - They sent him to Chicago. We have to see Kaufman at 9:15. What did they do to you up there? Who? Everyone. The butler and everyone. Did he unpack your things? Did he say anything? No. He might have said how well I packed your bags. Never mind him. - I do mind. Someday I'm going to have a butler and I want to know how they work. Did you miss me? Very much. Remember, Kaufman is always bad on a Monday morning. Here's some paper and pencils. I want to tell you something. - Well, tell it quick. What are you looking at? Marvin. - Harry. What's the matter? Is it the heat? - I don't know. I love you. Well. Whatever put that in your mind? I don't know. Just now when I saw you .. I wanted to tell you. Darling. That is alright. I love you too, but there isn't much we can do about it right now. Get your things. Kaufman is waiting. Yes. The basic idea is alright. The trouble is there isn't any sex in it. Sex? You can't run a soap campaign without sex appeal. You get my idea, Miss Myles? - I think I know what you mean. That's what we're here for. Now. I've watched Mrs Kaufman with soap. It is intimate. Daintiness. Is that what you mean? Daintiness. Now we're getting somewhere. Wait. I'll see if Mr Bullard is out of conference. Maybe I didn't understand you when .. - Of course you did. How do you think I've felt all this time? Here comes Kaufman. Isn't he terrible? We go to see Mr Bullard now. Miss Myles. I hear you've found a word. I want you to tell it to me. I didn't want Mr Kaufman to spoil it. What do mean, I spoil it? Walter, you know how it was about the lubricating oil. Occasionally, you mangle words. Mangle the very web and woof that we're weaving. Come off it, can't you? You're not talking to a client. What is the word, Miss Myles? The word is: 'Daintiness'. Don't speak again. I do not want anyone to speak. Daintiness. Loveliness. The sheer glowing loveliness. Filminess. Evanescence. Dawn. Don't interrupt me. Mistiness. Daintiness. Alright. Use it. Use all the rest around it. That is fine, Miss Myles. It's alright? We can go ahead? Yes. It is alright. We can go ahead. It might be better to put Miss Myles in charge. I will edit it myself. Very well. If that's the way you feel about it, J.P. Come on. Thank you very much. - Miss Myles. Joe. - Yes, Miss Myles? Get me 25 copies of this by the morning. I'll get right on it. What a day. Everything has happened. Everything. I've got to go home and get a bath. - Marvin. Darling, you must learn to keep everything in its place. Go home, put on your dinner coat and call for me at eight. We are going to celebrate. Champagne and everything. Now go home and get dressed. I look awful. And so do you. No you don't. Don't you see? We are in the office now. Don't look that way. There is nothing to worry about. Well? Yes. Harry. Come right in. And don't leave the door open. I've got a new dress. Wait until you see it. I have been waiting all day. You have missed it again. Missed what? - The back of your head. You brush your hair in front but there is a place at the back you don't touch. You stay right here and I am going to get a brush. Stand still and don't wiggle. You tickle my neck. There's such a lot I have to do to you. There. Now turn around. Look at your tie. It's always sliding around. You look so wonderful in a dinner coat. You look as though you belong in it. Not like a waiter but like a Sergeant portrait. I hoped I look like .. Rudolph Valentino. - Yes. You won't know yourself when I get through with you. We'll dance the whole night through. Just one more waltz with you. It seems to be made for us too. I could just keep right on dancing. Forever being with you. I didn't know what you were like at first. Then. It sort-of all came over me. I wish I could say things nicely. You do if you say what you mean. I don't see what you see in me. Because I can do so much for you. That's what a girl really wants. It will be like a symphony. You're going to like all the things I like. I'm going to like all the things you do. I wish I could tell you the way I feel. When are we going to get married? You really want us to get married? Yes. Of course. I was wondering why you were so worried. I don't look that way. Of course I want to. I want to be sure that we really love each other. I am sure I love you. I want you to want to marry me so much. That you don't care about anything else. Anything. From now on I want us to have a good time. I want you always to be happy. And someday we'll have a penthouse overlooking the park. And a living room with nothing but Chippendale in it. You can take me over to England and I will buy it. We'll sail on the Berengaria. I want clothes in Paris too. What do you want? - Nothing. I'll watch you buy them. That's because you've always had everything. Sit beside me and tell me about everything. What sort of things? - The things you always tell me about. Westwood. Your family. Boston. Aren't you going to kiss me? Yes. Of course. Look. That's my own private little moon there. See? Very nice too. Marvin. Why are you crying? Darling. Promise me something. Anything. Don't ever leave me. No. Of course not. Just try to forget. That there is anyone but me. Marvin. Harry. Hello Joe. Hello Kay. I wondered if you'd be here. Miss Myles - Miss Motford, Mr Bingham. How do you do. You like football, Miss Myles? I don't know. This is my first big game. Harry is good at explaining the plays. Aren't you, Harry? Yes. We'd better hurry or we miss kick-off. You must get Harry to bring you up to Boston sometime. I would love it. - So long. Kay Motford. Bill's big flame. Harry, do you think I'm overdressed? - No. Of course not. Is she engaged to that boy? - Probably. To bring a girl all the way to New Haven unchaperoned is a public announcement. What will your friends think about us? Will they suspect anything? They'll suspect you are the prettiest girl in the stadium. There goes the kick-off. Come on, Harvard. Right down the field. You are awfully sweet. Marvin. Let's get married. I'm no good at this business of pretending. Yes. I know. I want everyone to know how I feel about you. Darling. Let's not talk about it now. We might spoil it all. We should talk about it, Marvin. If we don't .. This may not last. - I know. It's not that I don't think about it all the time. It is going to be so complicated. There will be all those people I don't know and all those things I don't know. Someday we'll go down to Maryland or somewhere and get it over with. Then we'll go and see your family. Let's not talk about it now. Alright. We thought you deserted us. - Don't you ever eat? A clock is a factory. Which handles the most precious off all commodities. Time. Would you stop to read that or wouldn't you? No I would not. - You wouldn't. I thought it might get me my Christmas bonus. Yep? Boston. I suppose it's the family. Hello. Is that you? - Yes. Harry. Did you get my message? Get nearer the telephone. I can't hear you. Can you hear me now? - Yes. Go ahead. The doctors say you must come right away. Is it mother? No. It's father. Harry, they think he is dying. Can you hear me? It started when he came back from shooting. The doctors want you right away. Alright. I'll take the three o'clock. That will get me home around nine. Tell him I'm coming and give him my love. And Mary. - Yes? Tell him I am with him all the time. They want me. Father is very ill. I'll go with you. I can stay somewhere. No need for you to do that, Marvin. I'll go. Call me up tonight anytime. Alright. Marvin. Tell Bullard, will you. Goodbye, Marvin. Don't say that. Don't say goodbye. Ever. Harry. Hello father. I just got here. Good. Don't go away. I'm not going anywhere. This is where you belong. Should be a man in the house. Mr Pulham. It only tires you out to speak. We never did go shooting. That is alright, sir. We'll get there still. It's going to be alright. Mr Pressley has finished the formalities for the safe deposit vault. He's here now with a box. You father never liked delays in probating a will. We might as well begin. Your mail, Mr Harry. - Thank you, Miss Redfern. After Mr Pressley goes perhaps we can go ahead with the town hall appraisal? Yes. We can go ahead. 'My dearest, dearest, darling'. 'Time is such a funny thing without any constant value'. 'It is so dreadfully long now that you and I are not together'. 'I've been thinking of you all day and I will think of you tonight'. 'Even when I am asleep'. 'And I still count each minute until I hear you are coming back'. 'I don't seem to be one person anymore because ..' 'Part of me always seems to be with you'. Morning, Harry. If you're ready we can start checking the common stocks. Pull up a chair. We'll spread them out on the desk. Sorry. There was a delay at the bank. Alright. I understand. 'It's such a terrible time'. 'I went through it'. 'It's so terrible to have someone go'. 'And to know that never will you see him again'. Harry, did your father speak to you about North Star? Sorry. I wasn't listening. North Star? You'd better consider whether you hold that or sell it. I will. 'We're never going to see each other again'. 'I should think, of course it isn't so'. 'Someday I'll see him. Right on the street or somewhere'. 'And then you would kiss me'. 'And I would tell you I was sorry'. Mr Jeffreys is here to see you about the Roxburgh mortgage. Ask him to wait. I'll come out to see him. 'It won't be long before I see you, will it?' 'If you love someone and can't do anything about it'. 'It makes you awfully helpless'. 'All I can do is to make you think when you're up there alone'. 'That it's not so bad if you know you have someone forever and always'. 'Someone you can always come back to, dear'. 'Anytime or anywhere'. 'I love you so'. 'And I don't know why and I don't care'. The probate papers have come from the Armitage estate. Should I know about them? - Mr Pulham examined them his last day. Mr Jeffreys is waiting. Alright. I'll see him in a minute. 'Come as soon as you can'. 'Don't be too busy'. 'Don't get too lost'. I think I'll go up to New York tomorrow. Just for a few days. Harry, do you have to? It was bad enough before when you were away. Now, the house is so empty. And there's mother. I don't know what mother would do. Even just for a day or two. I thought there were some odds and ends I ought to attend to. Just some odds and ends. And then. I'd sort-of like to know what Bill King is doing. I am sort-of out of touch with Bill. Why not ask Bill King to come up here? Well. You could ask him over the weekend if you like. Alright, Mary. That might be a good idea. Now you are being nice. You know, you are really awfully nice. I'll go up and read to mother. She wants to finish Emerson's essay on conversation tonight. Mary. If Bill does come it might be nicer .. I just thought. There is a girl who works in the office with us. You can talk to her while I talk to Bill. What girl? I don't know if I ever told you about her. Her name is Myles. Marvin Myles. It might be nice to ask her. I think it would be awfully nice. I think it would be too. I might even call up Bill tonight. Goodnight, Mary. - Goodnight. Darling, you look like a teddy bear. Did you have a nice trip? - Fine. Yes. Fine. You look just the same. Are you? - Of course I am. Good. Where do we go from here? Where do we go from here? Anywhere from Jersey City to a pier. I hope Marvin likes it here. Of course she will. Why shouldn't she? - I don't want her to think it is .. Stuffy. Harvard people are all like that. - Really? Go ahead, Mary. Happy? It's just what I thought it would be like. You found everything upstairs that you wanted? Yes. Everything is lovely. When can I see your mother? Tomorrow morning. She's already retired. We'll want some ginger ale, Hugh. Bill, you'd like a highball? You know me. - That's all. What about me? Bring the tray, Hugh. - Yes, sir. What did I do wrong? Nothing really. It might upset things for us for us to be seen drinking highballs. It will be alright when you leave. We wash the glasses afterwards. You mean he'll smell the glasses? Hugh is an awful sneak. You girls don't want to lose your good reputation. It isn't that. Hugh would tell everybody downstairs and someone would be sure to tell mother. I see. This is our private stock. May I help, sir? - I'll do that, Hugh. Scotch or bourbon, Bill? How about you, Marvin? Just a drink. A good stiff drink. No thank you. I believe I will have one. Thanks. Don't let him worry you. Look at me. He doesn't worry me. You. I thought we could go out to Westwood and take a picnic lunch. Westwood? Why not go to the north pole instead? It will be warm if we exercise. Exercise. I thought we could chop wood. If we don't do that we can go coasting. I want Marvin to see it. Darling, I haven't any clothes. - Mary can lend you something. She has some old tweeds. You can borrow a sweater of mine. That will look funny. With an 'S' on it for St. Swithin's. You mean we go out there just to look at the snow and the ocean? Joe Bingham and Kay Motford are coming along. She's coming too? I asked her because I knew you've always liked Kay. That's more like it. Harry, when do those two get married? She and Joe get married in June. I suppose it's too cold up here to get married in the wintertime. Your mother will see you now, sir. Come on. Just a touch. What is the matter? Is my slip showing? I wish it were. It would give mother something homely to work on. Maybe I have too much make-up on. I'll take some powder off my nose. No. Of course not. You mustn't worry about mother. I'm not. You're the one that's worrying. Harry dear. Mother, this is Marvin Myles. Sweet of you to come to see us. So kind of you to ask me. Harry tells me you read Emerson. Yes. It's nice to be certain and not just hope that Harry knows nice girls. They're really nice girls in New York. - I knew you'd like her, mother. Sit down here near me. Let me see. There was a Whitney Myles from New York. He was in father's class at Harvard. They were both in the tug-of-war team. Are you related to Whitney Myles, my dear? No. I'm not. You see, I lived there. But I was not born in New York. I see. Harry is so reticent. All he said was, King is coming and a girl I know from New York. A girl I know from New York. Do you know who that is? That is Harry. That's Harry when he was five. It wasn't my fault I dressed like that. There he is at six months. Here he is when he went to St. Swithin's. Here is a lock of his baby hair. Mother. I never dreamed I would have such a big boy of my own. One of these days, my dear. You'll realise why a mother worries so much more about a boy than a girl. Harry, take my handkerchief and put a few drops of Cologne on it. You always do it so nicely. Now you must tell me all about yourself. Everything. I work for the J.P. Bullard Company. I am a copywriter there. How nice. You and Bill and Harry all together in that queer place. Harry tells me so little. Tell me about your family. Well. When my family came to America they settled in Illinois. In Illinois? That reminds me of a little joke. Thank you. Have you heard about the lady who said she came from Iowa? And someone else said: 'Yes. But here we call it Ohio'. But you mustn't feel you're a stranger here. I don't. Not really. But I am a bit mixed-up too. It is just like Iowa and Ohio. Well, it's time for our medicine now. Alright, Miss Percival. Harry, when you to Westwood be sure to have Patrick put chains on the car. Yes. You'll call in to see me this evening? - I would love to. Mary will read to us. Emerson's essay on friendship. This makes me feel like a new man. That is a break. What's the matter? - Everything makes me itch. There is nothing like winter air in the country. Look at the snow queen. Why didn't you let me know sooner you were here? You know me. Here today, gone tomorrow. Bill is full of prunes. Look at that ice. We should try it. If you call me up ahead of time and come down, I'll show you how fit I am. Come on. Let's show them how it's done. - Alright. Hold tight. Now don't be like Ethan Frome. I want to live. Give us a shove. That wasn't so bad, was it? No. It was fun. Don't let them do that, Marvin. Throw one back. It's awfully cold, isn't it. How is that now? There is still some down my neck. You may not believe it but it's warm here in summer. There's white wisteria all along the front porch. And the leaves are out on the silver beeches. Of course it's a little gloomy now with everything put away for the winter. I want you to see it in summer with all the doors and windows open. It's such a nice old house. When we were kids, we always slid down. We never used the stairs. And up there. A large family of ghosts lived in the back hall. I had names for all those ghosts. I knew their ages and their sizes. Marvin, are you still cold? - Just a little. I'm awfully sorry. Standing out here in the cold hall. Go by the fire. That will thaw you out. It's only because I want to tell you everything. There wouldn't be anybody who can see us if you kissed me. Except the ghosts in the back hall. For a moment I forgot it was winter outside. I thought it was May and I saw all the garden filled with tulips. You are so sweet. I wish I didn't love you so. You look just the way I always wanted you to. Sitting there with the fire light dancing in your hair. You have many ties here, haven't you. This is your home. You're not coming back to New York. You're going to stay here. I know it. If I stay here, you're staying too. You never say the wrong things. There is a bigger difference between Boston and New York than you realise. The people are the same in both places. All through my childhood I was poor. And I felt sorry for myself. Then one day I found I could earn my own living. And I was proud and I liked myself for the first time. I know that if I didn't feel independent I would be unhappy. Foolish, isn't it? But true. I understand. Well, softies. Don't you like the snow? Up a point. Where's Kay and Bill? Did they come back here? No. Why should they have? They went walking somewhere. I thought they came back with you. They'll be back. Still some coffee left. Who wants coffee? Thanks. How about you, Joe? - No. Not now. Gee, I wonder where they are. It's getting kind-of late. - It isn't even five yet. You should see it in April. I'd love to take you out in April. Walking in the mud. It's alright, Joe. They'll be back in a minute. Bill won't let her catch cold. Sometimes, for somebody grown up, you make some pretty dumb remarks. Joe is jealous. Who should I be jealous of? Are you intimating that I am jealous of Bill King? It's just that they may be lost or something in the woods. What in the world would Bill and Kay be doing in the woods? Walking, of course. When Kay goes anywhere she always starts walking. You know how she walks, Harry. Yes. I know. Oh boy, where do we go from here? Anywhere from Jersey to Harlem with you, dear. How can you stick in the house on a day like this? It isn't day. It is darned near night. Alright. On a night like this then. Harry, you know where we've been? Down to the brook. What a piece of real estate. I didn't know you had a brook. Yes. Brooks and everything. What's the matter, Joe? Patrick is here. I think we'd better get back. I guess so. Here today and gone tomorrow. Time to take my one night's rest. Harry, don't. I don't want you to go tonight. I don't want you to go ever. You're going to stay here, Harry. You are going to stay in Boston. I know. [ Door knocks ] Harry. I have to talk to somebody. Joe. - You're my best friend. Gee, I think I am going crazy. - What's the matter? I don't know how to tell you. I didn't know these things happened. Kay has broken her engagement. It happened yesterday. You had a fight or something? I don't know. I don't know what happened. I thought everything was alright. You don't suppose it could be .. Something about .. Bill King, do you? Bill King? Kay hardly knows him. That's right. Besides, what can anybody see in Bill King? I know he's your friend. But frankly, I always thought he was a long drink of cold water. If Kay really feels that way perhaps it's better to call it off. I think it shows a good deal of courage on Kay's part. It's not anyone's fault if two people aren't suited to each other. It's better to know it now than later. I'm a fine one to give advice. What about Marvin and me? When are we going to get married? Well. I am sure everything works out for the best. You and Kay are both .. Sensible people. Thanks, Harry. You've always been my best friend. It's better to have a showdown than to let things drift. Thanks, old man. Better to have a showdown than to let things drift. Miss Redfern. - Yes? Call the Bullard advertizing agency in New York. The Bullard advertizing agency in New York. [ Door knocks ] Just a minute, darling. Let's drink to our health. Alright. Let's. Go on. I am ready. - Alright. Ooh. To you and me. Always alone. For years and years. You went to the office? I couldn't bear to meet you there. Not at first. In front of everybody. - I wouldn't have cared. Have you seen Mr Bullard? - Bullard? When you were waiting for me? Dear, I told him you were coming in. Never mind. See him first thing tomorrow. Not tomorrow. We are getting married tomorrow. My darling. Tomorrow? We have no place to live. There'll be room until we find a place. Where? Here in the hotel? - Not a hotel. There's plenty of room at home while we look for something. I couldn't. You belong to me. But no, not there. It's only be for a while until we get a house. Darling. There's nothing to be afraid of as long as you love me. No. Not there. We belong to each other here. Everything of you and me is here. Marvin. - No. Marvin. - I can't. Why, Marvin? I thought you liked it. No. I hated every minute of it. Then you must hate me too. - No. It was not the you I've ever known. You know it. You've tried to get away from it too. That house, where you can't hear any footsteps. The ticking clock. Having to sneak highballs. You would have your own house. Just the way you wanted it. I don't just want a house. Darling. I love you more than anything. But I couldn't live that kind of life. I couldn't join discussion clubs and fuss with curtains. I would be dreadful at that. Not at all what you cared about. There wouldn't be anything left of me. Marvin. Don't. Please don't. Let's try to be sensible. - I'm being absolutely sensible. Don't you see? I can't be different from what I am. That's absurd. No-one wants you to be. I won't spend my life pretending. That is me. I cannot be anything else. I know what you mean, but .. - I simply wouldn't belong. You'd get used to it. I don't want to get used to it. I have my own life. My own life. - I have my own life too. Darling, don't look so angry. I want you to stay here where I can take care of you. Up there you become someone else. We would end by despising each other. I have to live where I belong. Then what made you work at the Bullard office? I don't know. I guess you can never get away from the way you've been brought up. I belong at home and that's where I'm going. I never would fit into a penthouse overlooking Central Park. I'll not be the husband of the women's copy department at Bullard's. I am not going with you. Do you understand? Yes. But I am going. I guess it's all over, Marvin. All over. Just like that. Perhaps it's just as well. You took up a lot of my time. - You took up a good deal of mine. Let's not fight anymore. At least it's something to remember. I guess there is nothing more I can say to make you change your mind. Harry. Harry, wait. I want to tell you something. No matter what happens. No matter how long. I will always be waiting for you. If you want to come back. Goodbye, Marvin. They say that you can get over anything in time. I don't believe you can. But given enough time you can put it where it belongs. I'm awfully glad you called me up this morning, Kay. You'd better trim in the jib. You never keep it flat enough. You do better if you keep it off a little. Harry. We're neither of us happy, are we? Why do you say that? Well. If you are unhappy, you can tell when someone else is. Everyone around here acts so darned contented. I know what you mean. It's no good trying to be different from what you are. Did you ever try it? Yes. I have tried. It does not work. Oh well. Kay. Don't look at me. I'll be alright in a minute. I don't know. I feel so futile. Here. You had better let me take the boat. It's all such a .. rut. Here I am. Here we both are. Yes. Here we are. There is something I never told anyone. There was a man. No-one from around here. It was. Well, different. I thought he was going to take me away. He didn't even try. I never guessed, Kay. - It doesn't matter now. Then there was that girl in New York, wasn't there? We're in the same boat, aren't we? Yes. We're in the same boat. I didn't mean to come out here and make a scene. I hate people who do. Do I look alright? You look beautiful. You never told me that before. I didn't mean to be such a fool. You haven't been. Seeing you has made me feel a whole lot better. Harry. Maybe the people we know are better. We know what they are going to do. Yes. Of course. You always say 'Of course'. Are you sure you've got the ring? - Just .. Keep your pants on and say what the man tells you out of the book. If this happens to me I'll do it before a New York judge somewhere downtown. Maybe you're right. But Kay couldn't do that. That is Kay. I know she wouldn't. Well, there I was. There were all the others. I knew every one of them was happy. I could tell by their approving smiles. Yet for some strange reason mother was crying. Kay's mother was crying. Why is it mothers are always crying at weddings? And was the skipper pleased. Almost every week that summer I had been hearing that same music. Here comes the bride. Here comes the bride. Why did they let Bo-Jo and Joe walk together? Someone should have noticed that. Mary was more frightened than if she were getting married. I bet she would have liked a drink about then. Kay looking prettier than I'd ever seen her. Came gliding down the aisle as calm and collected as if she were walking a dog. Then the preacher was intoning the same old words I'd heard over and over. Only this time when he stopped. I realized it was up to me to make the answers. Exactly what he was saying I don't seem to remember. Because his Adam's apple was distracting my attention. Why was he asking me if I would love her? And honor and keep her in sickness and health. Doesn't he know I always do the right and honorable thing? I will. Repeat after me please. With this ring. I do thee wed. Amen. Amen. I hope the desk clerk thought we were really married. I took my glove off so he could see the ring. Harry, come here. Of course, dear. Sit down. Harry. I'm not sure whether we love each other or not. What? Wouldn't it be awful if we thought we loved each other but really didn't? What I really mean is .. We only got married because we thought we ought to. I guess everybody feels that way. Maybe millions and millions of people always have. Don't worry, Kay. Everything will be alright. I don't want to be silly but I suppose most girls are. No you're not. It's alright as long as you're here. You won't leave me, will you? - Of course not. Not ever? - Not ever. Please kiss me. Of course, dear. Harry. It's only a little thing but .. Could you just stop staying 'of course'. Yes, Kay. Of course. Morning, dear. You're late. Good morning. I know it. Never mind the paper. You're not going to read it with your breakfast? There's nothing but war news in it anyway. Do you have a headache? No. I am alright. What is that? It's Miss Gladys. She's hurrying to school and has fallen down the stairs. She has dropped her box of spiders. Spiders? She hatched them herself for a nature class. Are you alright, dear? Yes. They didn't get away. Except one. Never mind if it's only one. Hurry, dear. The taxi is waiting. Go away, Mitzi. Go away. It just came apart in my hands. Alright. Close the door tight so I won't hear anymore. That's life, I suppose. Everything is alright and solid. Suddenly comes to pieces in your hands. I told you not to have that highball after dinner. That's why you thrashed about all night. It always gives you indigestion. I don't have indigestion. It was my class biography. I kept thinking about my life. Harry. Going over all of it. All of this. When the children were born. When you and I met at dancing school. It was all there. Like adding up a balance sheet. It almost made me frightened. - Frightened? I kept saying to myself, what is it all about? What is it all about? What is what all about? Kay. Let's get away from all this, can we? You and I alone together. Harry, that is awfully silly. We've been married for twenty years. It's a little hard to be romantic, isn't it? If we just packed a bag, took the car and went someplace. Anyplace. Never mind about all the rest of it. Darling, I never heard you say anything like this before. It's all around me like a wave. I just want to know that you are there too. It's like reaching for you in the dark. Kay, if I got the car. You act as though I hadn't been a good wife to you. You can ask anybody. - Kay. Have you ever really loved me? Of course I have. I love you now. I love our life. It's what we both were made for. Yes. I know. Have we ever really loved each other? Have we ever been happy? - Of course we have. For years and years. Then why can't we ever see each other? Do you think we'd be able to see other better if we went somewhere in the car? We wouldn't have to talk about dishes. Suppose I get the car right now? Harry. Not right now. Some other time. I have to start paying the bills. I have luncheon engagements today and tomorrow. I judge the flower arranging competition at the garden club this afternoon. Kay. If I ask you, please? If I say how much it will mean to me. I certainly won't. If you brought that car to the door you'd be ashamed of yourself. Not even if I asked you? Harry, please. I am much too busy to run away into nowhere. Look. Alright. Go away. I'm not going to answer these letters now. Miss Rollo. Get me Mrs .. Ransome. Mrs John Ransome at The Hadley. Tell her I'd like to speak to her. Is that you, Marvin? This is Harry. Harry Pulham. You think you have to tell me who you are? Marvin, remember what you told me once? 'No matter what happened. Now matter how long'. I have never forgotten that. It's been in my mind all the time. It's been with me too. Well, Marvin? - I said I'd be waiting. Do you think it would be alright? I mean, if I called on you? You mean alone up here? My reputation? Harry. You're just the same. Come in. Hello Marvin. Hello. You haven't changed at all. Your necktie still doesn't match. I never could seem to do that with ties. It has been so long But it's lasted all this time. Yes. It's lasted. All the little things. They've been there somewhere. Your hair never would stay down. You tried. With soap and everything. Darling. Put your things down. Come here. [ Telephone ] Hello? Alright. I will take it. Yes. This is Mrs Ransome. What's that? Chiselling, eh? No. We won't split the commission with anyone. It's fifteen percent or nothing and we select the median. If you don't care to sign the contract, send it back. That is definite. They'll sign it. Harry, I remember the first time I really seemed to hear your voice. Where? That day we were washing socks in the Bronx. You said, 'May I call you Marvin?'. We've lasted. We'll always last. - Yes. Over time and space. I brought some champagne. Lunchtime is a little early. Somehow, I never liked it without you. I have some already. You'll open it? - Of course. I used to wait for the cork to pop. Remember? Yes. And every time it always made you jump. Alright. Wait a minute. There's something else. You'll never guess. - What? I bought it after you called me this morning. You will never guess. To us. Those old records. Don't. It's wonderful. We did so many wonderful things together. Oh yes. No-one has ever read me a poem since then. Marvin. There was one. I've dreamed of you saying it so many times. Here I lie. Something about a hunter. Why should we be standing up? We're not at a cocktail party. It's funny. I don't seem to know whether we're standing up or sitting down. Gosh. That is grand champagne. You always drank champagne too fast. Always liked to get it down. Marvin. What are you thinking? Everything is just the same, isn't it? Harry, dear. Have you been happy? Yes. I've been happy, Marvin. That is. Yes. I have been happy. How about you? Me? I have a butler and a yacht. Well, I have a boy and a girl and a Sealyham. Harry, how old is he? The boy I mean. Fifteen. He's going to St. Swithin's. I'd love to see him. Does he look like you? I have a picture of him here. - What's his name? George. He doesn't look so good now. He has pimples. He looks a little like you. The girl. Where is the little girl? - Right here. I can't see her very well. Why is she burying her head in the grass? She is looking for spiders. - Spiders? She likes to look for them. Funny, isn't it. You've never met John, have you. John? The man I married. He looks like you, doesn't he. I think that's why I married him. Does he? Of course he does. Darling. Harry. Where is your handkerchief? Give me some more of that. - Yes. Of course. Darling, we cannot go back. I've always had the idea at the back of my mind that we could. That's not the way it's meant to be. Whether we like it or not we've got to go on. That's that. Well. We'll have lunch downstairs in the dining room. If that is alright with you, Harry. Anything you say, Marvin. Harry. Harry. Kay. Is anything the matter? - No. I wanted to see you. That's all. Anything happened at home? No. There is something I wanted to tell you. I tried to get you on the telephone. Miss Rollo said you were out to lunch. I called the squash club but you weren't there. I've been waiting here. It is after three o'clock. Well, I was at lunch. Harry. You've been drinking. In the middle of the day. Yes. Champagne. Harry, you know what champagne does to you. It doesn't do anything to me and it makes no difference if it does. Have you been to some wedding that I forgot about? No. Not to a wedding exactly. Where have you been then? If you must know, I have been having lunch with Marvin Myles. Oh. She. She used to be so attractive. Is she as pretty as she used to be? Yes. That is, almost. I cancelled all my engagements. Gave up the garden club and everything to come down and get you. Harry, I thought about it all day. I want to tell you that .. Get in the car. I really should go up to the office and sign my letters. Please Harry. What is it? About what you said this morning. Whether we've ever been in love. We've always loved each other. We've loved each other so much we have never bothered to talk about it. I guess when people have been married for a long time .. They begin to take things too much for granted. That's alright, Kay. I'll be alright tomorrow. Harry, don't you know that I love you? With you and me it isn't only passion. Wish. That's all there is with any two people at first but .. With us it's more. So much more. It's what love really is. All the days and all the years of you and me together. That's what I said this morning. I know. I know it now. Our bags are in the back. Kay. I packed yours myself. Just the way you like it. I don't want to seem selfish, Kay. You shouldn't break your engagements. Nazis claim three cruisers. Read all about it. Three cruisers sunk. Where would we go? Anywhere. To the Berkshires. The leaves will all be out. We can't go running away like this. Can't we? Harry, There is nothing another woman can do for you that I can't do. Kay. Harry, you may not have been aware of it but .. You've always been in love with me. I don't believe we've ever been very far apart. Since that first day in dancing school. Have we, Harry? I guess that's the way it's always been. You and me. To the Berkshires then? - Yes, Kay. Of course. ..s-d..
