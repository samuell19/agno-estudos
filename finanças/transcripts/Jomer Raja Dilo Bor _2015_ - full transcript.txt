"1000 Reasons to Hate Men"... You really need guts to write something like this. We can't deny that we are still living in a male dominated soceity. And from there, Ms. Ria Banerjee... The fearless Ms. Ria Banerjee... Has written a book that will expose men in front of the soceity. But I can't agree with the "magnificient writing" part... Everything I've written in this book is the truth. And no man will be able to deny any one of the 1000 reasons. So, out these 1000 reasons, which is your favourite reason? You heard me right! Men only have a body. They don't have a soul. You have a very unique idea about men. Can you tell us the reason behind this more explicitly? Men have very physical needs... The first thing they have on their minds is hunger... Eat this... Eat that... "I feel like eating this today"... "I feel like eating that tomorrow"... "So, what can you cook really well?" She is your cook! Second... Pain... Pain in the hand, pain in the leg, headache... "Give me a foot massage"... "Give me a head massage"... How about they get their necks strangled? Doesn't matter what time of the day it is or what situation it is... So, these three needs are enough to prove that men only have physical needs. And that they are all about the body. They have no heart or soul. So, Rabindranath Tagore or William Shakespeare did not have a soul? They were just robots devoid of human emotions, right? So, what you are trying to say is... Works like "Romeo and Juliet" or "The Home and the World" were created by robots, right? Can you tell us about your family? Your father? But when he was alive, was he human or robot? Did your mother marry a human or a robot? You stay put with your robotic theories and ideas... Just remember, don't repalce patriarchy with matriarchy... I'm leaving. You have really strong opinion about men. Will you ever get married? No! Yes, she must get married! What are you doing here? I have come here to make you say yes to the marriage! And this the perfect place, right? -Please, dont do this here. -Greetings to everyone! -I didn't do anything... It's all mom... -I am Indrani Banerjee. This is my elder daughter, Ria. That's Ria's sister, Payel. Payel is 26 years old. That means she is old enough to get married. And her sister is already passed that age... You keep shut... When Ria was 13... Their father left us... Since then, I have single handedly raised them, educated them... Just to see this day... You tell me, is this fair? Mom, what are you doing? Just say yes and I'll stop. I am not saying yes to this. You know, all her friends are married. Some of them even have kids. I don't think I will be alive to see my grandchildren... Ask her what will she do if "didi" doesn't get married? Ask her quickly before others start asking questions. -Ma'am, I have a question... -One second... Please, let me ask one question? Okay, okay, do it quickly... -See, it wasn't a personal... -Was that even a question? Wait... -What will you do if "didi" doesn't get married? -What? -Ria Banerjee! Ria Banerjee! -Sorry, sorry... What will you do if Ria Banerjee doesn't get married? That is the correct question. You tell me what should I do? You all tell me what to do. That's why I've come to you. Tell me what should I do as a mother? I'll tell you... If my elder daughter, Ria Banerjee, does not get married in the next three months... Then... Then... After three months, I'll come back to this bookstore... And as you all as my witness... I'll commit suicide! I will commit suicide! Why will she commit suicide? Ms. Banerjee, do you hate men more than you love your mother that you are not listening to her? -You can still say yes... -Don't you have any responsibilty towards her? Don't you love your mother? Why are you quiet? Don't you have any responsibility? Why aren't you guys saying anything? Just say it... Please... You have to answer us. Is your mother's life worth nothing? -Don't you respect her? -What is this? Don't you love your own mother? Spill it out! I will get married! Sir, I've got the breaking news! She is getting married... Yes, sir! I don't know in six months or a year... But she is getting married... -Can you give me your credit card? -Why?! -What? -Yes! -Did she have a boyfriend? -Chintu? Who's Chintu? She is a little mad at me... Yes... yes... I'm telling your story I'm trying to understand you I am fighting your battle In your arena Your bolted door And your tightly shut window Why are you so serious? Who are you up against? Why are you pushed by your opinions? Your situation is wound up in trouble. What kind of groom are you looking for? Tell us... I am Kumar Kapoor Khan. I am Stallone's grandson. So much joy in the skies and the air... I might be a little old but I can still play a long innings... Your name was hiding somewhere in my thoughts, Ria... I am Nana from Ghana, with love... Monkey! Scoundrel! Do you want a wife or a maid? Please forgive me. Who do you think is perfect? Who do you think is useless? You throw up your hands in the air And demand a new toy The problem is very strange That's why the solution has to be unusual The kind of stories you are telling Everyone is thrown off Okay, Partha, see you here around 12... Tomorrow can you... -12 o'clock. -12 o'clock. I am fighting your battle In your arena Your bolted door And your tightly shut window Why are you so serious? Who are you up against? Why are you pushed by your opinions? Your situation is wound up in trouble. What kind of groom are you looking for? Tell us... What kind of groom are you looking for? Tell us... Tea? -Tea... -Mom, I'll serve him... Tea? Mom, why are you sweating so much? I am sure your blood pressure is high again... Isn't it obvious? The way you are rejecting the men, I might have to commit suicide at the book store... What rubbish is this? Each one of the men you had selected for me belonged to different breeds of MCP. And mom, to find a half decent guy these day is nearly impossible... You tell me, where will you find a proper eligible bachelor? Who will agree to marry me even after knowing that I hate men... -Got it! -What? A perfect eligible bachelor for sister... -Look at this picture, mom! -He is so handsome! -He is so good looking! -Wow... Did you find me a Superman? Not Superman, Ria... I hope he is not bald like R.K. Laxman's common man. Mom, if Didi rejects this guy, please consider him for me... -You just can't let him go. -I'll decide who is supposed to be getting married to him... Ria, move over. Let me sit... Ria, my sweetheart, my angel. I have one last request for you... One last time... Just see that guy once... Just see him once... Such an angelic face... Right? I have a really good feeling about him... Please see him once... -I think he was meant for... -Tomorrow, 12o'clock. Now, leave. It's already 12... Your common man is still not here... It seems you are really excited to meet him. Stop kidding, okay. There he is! Hello! -Oh, you are Deb? -Das. I know my name is a little... Actually, my grandmom... She really liked reading Saratchandra, so she named me Deb Das. Parvati! Why are you still standing outside... Come in... Please come. Please sit. You are Ria Banerjee? Why are you still standing. Please sit. Hey, what's wrong with you? At least give him a couple of minutes to relax. -Here, have something to drink. -No, no. It's okay. Skyline International, it's an MNC. I am a service engineer. My take home salary is Rs 70,000, after deductions. Plus there are some quarterly incentives. I got my M.B.A degree through distance learning while doing my job. Wow! Our soon-to-be son-in-law is really intelligent. I didn't ask for your resume. What is your opinion about women? See... I don't think we should look at men and women differently. They are different as far as physicality is concerned. But I believe it's high time to start seriously thinking about gender equality. Have you read my last book? Haven't read it. It might be surprising... I prefer reading romantic short stories and romantic novels. But I don't disrespect other kinds of writing. -You are right. -See... Everyone has a different opinion. The same way, the fingers on our hands are different. It's only natural that individuals will have different opinions. Exactly. My monthly expenses are covered by my salary from an I.T. company. But how long will you be able to keep the job? What do you mean? No, actually, I have a feeling... She is going to be a best selling author very soon... You won't need a job after that. I mean you won't even get the time... -And if you want, after the... -What do you mean by after? "After" the wedding... We will be able to live comfortably on my salary... You concentrate on your writing. I'll take care of the rest. I thought one had to say "I love you" or "Will you marry me?" on one knee to propose... I mean... Whatever I just said... Actually, I have never done this before... Poor boy! It was not my intention to insult you... Deb, tell us about your family... -Father? Mother? -I am alone. My parents passed away when I was very young. After that, it has been the orphanage, the college hostel and the job at campusing... But now I'm back at my grandfather's place. All the memories of my parents are in that house. I am so sorry... Please don't feel bad. I am used to living alone. Actually, I've lost my parents so early on... I can't even remember their faces clearly... I've never had a family of my own... That's why I really wanted a family... You will definitely have a family! Mom, Deb was trying propose to Didi and you just had to... No, I'm really sorry... -So, tell us, what is your decision? -What? How can I decide right away? It doesn't work like this. Strange! What is there to think about? What is your secret desire? Oh, that's nothing... That was just part of the profile... Don't be shy... Tell us... I always wanted to be a singer... I've never had the courage or the strength to persue my passion with a full time job like her. That's why no one has heard my voice beyond by bathroom... You can sing? I just hum now and then... Great! Why don't you hum something for my sister? -No, no... Please... -Sing something... Please sing something... I can't remember anything right now... This song... With the high hope I have come, let me come closer Force me not outside... Mmm...Mother... With the high hope I have come, let me come closer Acceptance is lower for the poor and the downtrodden You'll accept me - I am sure. My requisites are simple, Allow me to stay at your feet. My requisites are simple, Allow me to call you 'My Mother'... Have you come to convince me? No! I have come to tell you that you can choose anyone but just leave this guy alone. Please! Why, what is the problem with him? No, no, he is not the problem. It's all you. You don't deserve him. You are nothing compared to him. He is a million times better than you. -I don't deserve him? -No! -Me? -Yes! Am I your daughter or did you just pick me up? Listen, if you were my daughter, you would have said yes to him then. What gibberish, Ria! Please try and understand. He respects your opinion. He wants to support you in everything you do. He has a good job. He is a self-made man. He doesn't have a family which means you don't have to deal with in-laws. You'll completely independent. I mean if you want it... You can leave your job and just write... He will support you. Unbelievable! You'll be his one and only! He has no one else. You'll be his centre of attention. -Mom! -Ria, you'll have his undivided love! It'll all be for you. Whatever he'll do will be for you and your family. You start your life with him, it'll feel like a dream. I mean it'll be like a holiday package... -Mom, what are you even talking about? -Shut up and listen to me... You'll have to marry someone. So, if you want to let him go, that's up to you... -Okay, say to him... -You just... Say yes to him. -What? What? What? -What did you just say? Say it again. One minute... I have a condition... I want you to verify all the information he was shared with us and on his profile. If it checks out... There's no one in his family even... I won't marry him if he has not been truthful... Okay, calm down and listen to me... I've been in the C.I.D. for the last 17 years... If need be, I'll break down doors and get the information on him...Child's play... Yay! My sweetie pie! Deb leaves home sharp at 9 a.m. Reaches office by 9.45 a.m... Very punctual... Gets back home sharp at 8 in the evening. Even though he lives alone, seems like a staright arrow... -Mom, he really is a good man! -Yes! What's all this? Your wedding shopping! Clothes from Shopper's Stop and jewellery from Chique! Naughty boy! Why are talking like this? I have cut up my top also for you... There won't be any problem for you... Trust me baby! You are very naughty! No, no... Yes... Just two more stops to go... -Do you want to sit? -No, no, it's alright. Yes, why? I am coming... Really... You know, I've cut two inches shorter... You do the rest... Please, stop the bus. I want to get off. This is Ria's mom. How are you? I'm okay. How are you? How is Ria? Yes, Ria is well. We are good. Are you very busy? No, I'm just waiting for my bus to work. Please tell me. Actually, I wanted share a good news with you. Ria has agreed to marry you. What happened? Why is he standing like that? Yes? Can I call you back? Can't hear you clearly in all this traffic. Calling you back in a bit... -What on earth?!? -What did he say? Didn't he sound happy? He hung up... Said there was a lot of traffic... -Where did he go? -He was right here... -How strange! There he is! -Mom, come quickly! Let's go. What's the matter with him? His office is in the other direction. Why is he going this way? I have no clue. He didn't even react at the good news. -Now he is not even going to his office... -Lets's go, let's go... -Slow down... -Watch out... -Where did he go? -I can't understand... Hope he is not a pyscho-killer... Maybe he kills the girl right before the wedding... What are you even saying, mom? I think he cons people... -Please slow down... -Let's go... -Where did he go? I asked you to walk faster... -Where did he disappear? He came this way... Payel, isn't this Deb? -What? -This is Deb. Mom, not there... Look here... -Mom, let's go... -Which way? That's him again! That's an old poster. It's all different now... Please let's go... Listen to me... I had never imagined that someone like Ria would agree to marry me. My boss... He had called to congratulate... Hey, no need to touch my feet. How are you? -I am fantastic as usual.. -Please sit. I'd never imagined, Ria would agree to get married... I am her friend and I'm more shocked than you are... My parents lovingly named me Manohar Gyandas. And colleagues jokingly turned it into... You can imagine what G stands for... Let's take a picture... Hey, how are you? Let me introduce you to my wife, Ria. -Hello! -My colleagues, Dwaipayan and Manish. Congratulations, sister-in-law, congratulations! -What about the gift? -Give her the gift... You might not know this but Deb has never had an affair. Not even a one night stand. So, basically you are getting a completely sealed piece... Deb, come here... Listen... It's your wedding night! Deb Junior has entered the major leagues! Eat well tonight. Drink a glass of milk and then just go for it... -What are you guys doing? -Move over... -We'll take your leave now. -Bye... We'll see you soon. Let's go. What happened? Are you feeling shy? It's our wedding night. You can't feel shy tonight... Let's do this! Let's make tonight... Even more special... Let's make it colourful... What happened? Why did you suddenly stand up? Where is Deb? Deb? Wasn't he with his friends? Oh, there he is... Deb's right there eating dinner... That boy really loves eating... He is on his fourth serving... Naturally, aunty! It's his wedding night... He needs all the strength he can get... -Jhumpa, give me your car keys. -Why? Don't ask so many questions... What do you need the keys for? I'll be back. What do you mean? You have to go to Deb's... -Ria, it's your wedding night. -I know! Didi, are you planning to run away? Listen to me. Just have a drink... all your tension will wash away... These tablets are very effective... Yes... If you mix two tablets in water, milk or juice... And give it to any man... They will be impotent for the next 8 to 9 hours... Yes... Doesn't matter how hard they try... If they ingest this tablet... They won't be able to use their "third leg" again... Ria, it's our wedding night... Let's become one... Such horrible dialogue! That's why I shouldn't watch so many movies... Where did I hear this? How much longer? Yeah... be there in a moment... You have already changed? Me too... That's the bathroom door. What's this? Oh, this is nothing. It's just a door... Nothing behind it... Just a wall... Just for show... -What were you doing in the bathroom for so long? -I was getting ready. -What? -No! I was just freshening up... Why? Didn't you brush your teeth in the morning? Yes... But I did it again... Why are you sweating? Are you feeling hot? No, actually, I mean... Washing my face in cold water before going to bed helps to destress... What are you trying to say? No... If you... Kiss... You really want to kiss? Nope... It was such long day with the reception... Why isn't it working? What happened? Nothing... nothing... Can't reach the tower... Why are you constantly looking down there? I don;t know... I can't access the network... There must be some problem with the server... Network? Server? What are you talking about? Sorry about the jargon... Occupational hazard... Get up, idiot! What? I think my system has crashed... Why did you get up? Are you trying to restore the system? Are you going to just stand there? I don't think I have the courage to... I think there has been a virus attack on my system... Do you have any idea what happened? I can't figure it out... I am trying really hard but... It's just not happening... Everything is shutting down even before booting... What's wrong? There might be some issue with the motherboard. Oh God! What's all this? Actually, the thing is, I've never been this intimate with a girl before... How would I know? That the hard disk would malfunction at such a crucial time... Please get up! This CPU is not going to work. I can't do this. What will happen now? What can we do? It's not your fault. We are already married... Ria, what should I do now? Doing seems to be the problem now... I'll go to bed then... -What about me? -You? -You also go to sleep. -Okay... -We'll talk in the morning then? -Okay. You should try again tomorrow... If it still doesn't work, sell it on OLX. I mean, if the software doesn't work, what will you do with the hardware? You have to get rid of it, right? Oh, please switch off the lights before you sleep... This is an open and shut case. The groom finds out on the wedding night that he is impotent. He went into depression. Wrote a small note. Suicide. No, Sir! I don't think it's that simple. I am sure there's some... I am suspecting the girl... Have you noticed that Ria is not crying? -This is not happening. -Ria... -Ria... -Why did this happen? Why would he commit suicide? This is so strange... Please listen to me... -Why would he commit suicide? -Listen to me... I can understand... Mom, you don't get it. It's a mistake... A person can't just die like that? Do you you what death means? Does it make sense to you? Just hung himself? He just died? -Isn't it strange? Why would he die? -Calm down... -I just... -You just did what? I just wanted to... Because we had just got married... Don't do this to yourself... Calm down... Please listen to me... Why can't you understand... Ria, listen to me... You have to calm down... You have to stay calm and be strong now... It's time for the cremation... Come... Come... Get up, Deb! Get up! Come with us, Deb! Won't you get up? Get up, Deb! It's time! Ria, what are you doing with this door? I am trying to open the door. Why? What is behind the door? Who is there? That's what I want to know. Oh God! If you don't know, why are you trying to open it at all? How will I know if I don't open it? -How strange! If you don't know... -Mom, please go home... I will talk to you later... Now, please leave... Ria, please listen to me... Is anybody there? Can you please tell me where is this place? Can't figure it out. Turn around and look up. Yamlok? It's not rubbish, Madam. This is Yamlok and I'm Chitragupta. Then how did I get here? You have died. That's why you are here. Absolutely not. In fact, my husband died today in the morning. Please tell me your name. You are still alive. Your husband passed away suddenly today. And it happened because of an evil person. This was not on our list. That person is Ria Banerjee. That's you. Gosh! You have killed your own husband. I...I...I haven't done anything... I haven't killed anyone... It's not my fault. I haven't done anything... But that's not what my software says. Deactivate your useless software. Yamraj himself has killed Deb. It's not my fault. I haven't done anything. Please tell Yamraj to return Deb. A living wife has come to take back her dead husband. Should I send her in? Again? Send her in... Please go in. I'm really sorry for your husband's death. Great! You killed him, now you are feeling sorry? You are making a mistake. I haven't done anything. You are the one who killed your husband. Me?!? I...I... What did I do? I haven't killed him... I just wanted to make him impotent... If I wanted to kill him, I would have given him poison. Those pills were poison to him. Anyway, no point making excuses now. And you have to rectify it. Give Deb back. This is not the fish market. I am the King of Jomaloy. My job is to take lives, not the other way around. What rubbish! I've heard you've sent a lot of people back from here. Haven't you sent Savitri's husband Satyaban back? You have to send Deb back. I'm sure you know, Savitri begged me to bring her husband back to life. And you've been shouting at me since you got here. How dare you? You might be Yamraj but you are still a man... Savitri satisfied your ego with her crying and you gave her husband back. I will not cry. And I will not satisfy your ego. And I will still take Deb back with me. Where do you think you are? Why should return Deb? I have some goodwill in the market... And before you give me your long speeches... you should be happy... You did not even want to get married. How are you suddenly so in love with him now? It's not what you think. One night of impotency can't drive someone to suicide. Repentance! I just wanted to make him impotent. -You put the idea of suicide in his head. -I did no such thing. It all happened because of those pills. So, directly or indirectly, you are responsible for his death. Are you going to give me back my husband or not? I have a policy. If you can change your policy for Savitri, you can do it for me too. Why? So, you are not going to change? Then, I am also not going to leave without Deb. Do whatever you want to. -You are really a smart ass... -Show me some respect... -What respect? Do you know who you are talking to? -Who am I talking to, huh? Bloody Yamraj! I'll punch your... Listen, I don't want to argue anymore. Are you going to let him go or not? It's impossible for me to completely return your husband. What do you mean? Are you going to chop off his head and limbs? You can either take his body or his soul back. Enough! I can return only one. Tell me which one you want. If it's just the body, the same problem will be back. He'll be hungry, sleepy, in pain, or he'll want sex... No, no. The soul is better. At least he'll have some feelings... But do men have a soul? -Now, tell me, body or soul? -Soul! Think about it. There's not much to think about. Tonight, your husband will go back to you... I'll take your leave now. Although she hates men... Even though she got married under pressure... Why was she so adamant to take her husband back? She doesn't want to prove anything to anybody. She just wants to get rid of the guilt by looking at her husband. She wants to forget what she has done. So, what will become of Deb Das now, Sir? I am back, Ria. You really don't have a body... It was cremated in the morning. H..How are you feeling? I don't feel much different. Actually, since the body is not there... That's why aches and pains, hunger and thirst... They have no meaning for me... I really like it, you know... Why? I really like it for myself. I'm just glad that I have you as my wife. After I was gone, you... You went to Yamraj to bring me back... We never got to spend too much time together... So, who asked you to commit suicide? Do you go a little crazy at night? You are not thinking about how I felt... And you... -With a impotent husband... -Who said you are... I mean... So what? Do you have to kill yourself over it? Anyway, let it be... I am glad you are back. Even though it's just your soul. At least you'll be with me. I haven't eaten anything since morning. Is there something at home? No... I mean... I live alone, so... -Then? -Just order something in... -Yeah, two mutton biryanis and a salad... Parcel... -Two... -9 Debdut Road. -9 Debdut Road. You get the order. I'll freshen up. Ma'am, one second... Can you tell me where 9 Debdut Road is? Back there. It's the cream coloured house. Flowers all around... Flowers? Why? Is there a wedding? House of death. Today, a newly wed husband passed away. -Death? -Why? Someone can't die? Who would order biryani from the house of mourning? I thought... We should celebrate my return with a candle lit dinner... Biryani. 300 Rupees. Can I ask you something? Yes? Did your husband die today? Yes. Is that your husband? You can see him? Yes, he's right there... That photo on the wall... Photograph? Yes... Yes. What's happening? I am alive and I can see you... Why can't he? He won't be able to see... No one except for you can see me... Why? Because you love me... You brought me back from Yamraj... I don't even want other people to see me... It's enough that you can see me... Let's have dinner. What's this? You won't eat? How will I eat? I don't have a body. So, no hunger, no thirst. You eat. And I'll watch you. That means I'll never have to cook for you. And since you don't have a body, I am sure you don't have any aches or pains. And... If you want to hug me? You don't have to worry about all that. Let's forget about my desires... Even if you... You have nothing to worry about. I have no such desires. I was just thinking... You won't even feel sleepy... Yeah, Mom... Were you sleeping? Did I wake you? No, no... I was going to wake up anyway... Are you alright? I'm fine. There's no problem. Are you going to stay there today or... I thinking of going back to work today. I've been on leave for a long time... Yeah, you'll feel much better at work... Please let us know if you need anything... Yes, of course. Bye. You look even more beautiful in the morning. Your Mac... Great! You've already joined work... -Did you offer her a drink? -Was just about to. So, you got married and killed your husband, all during the leave... Bygones... Bygones... Now that you are back... Hope you'll be diligent with work... If you could put your writing on the backburner... And concentrate on developing websites for our clients, it'll be great. What a scoundrel, really! He'll leave his father's funeral to make sure we are burning in hell... Don't think about him. Don't be bothered by what that lowlife has to say... Are you... okay? I was fine till now... This guy just made me feel horrible... Then let's go on a date after office. Okay, fine. Listen... I have to tell you something very important... What were you going to tell me, Ria? Deb is back. Okay... You... Should have your tea... -No, listen to me... -Finish your tea before it goes cold... No, listen to me... Please. Deb has really come back. Oh no, you have gone completely crazy... What'll happen now? -You don't believe me? -No, no, I do, I do... Deb has come back. And I believe you. It's great! -Ria, can I ask you something? -Yes, please... You didn't do anything to him, right? What happened? What happened? What's happening? What? See, you didn't want to get married... I didn't do anything, okay. Deb committed suicide. He killed himself. Drink you tea. How did you change your clothes? No, I haven't. I just felt like it... After you left I felt like looking at all my stuff... I opened the almirah... After that the feeling became so strong, that you think I have changed. Actually I haven't changed. -What kind of logic is this? -It's not logic, it's magic! No one can predict when or where or how one can develop feelings for another person. What did you do all day? I've almost finished reading this novel. You can't imagine how romantic this book is... One minute, one minute, why are you coming forward? You have forgotten, Ria. Even if I really wanted to... I'll never be able to touch you again... In that case, please continue reading as many romantic novels as you want... But there's no need to be romantic. The client's website that you have finalised, have you seen it yourself? Why? That website has nothing but content. There's no logo, no design... No added software... We are not a content development company, Madam. We are a web development company. Do you understand the difference? And if really want to write so much, why don't you just quit and write your books? No point taking a salary to support your hobby. Right? Please, talk to me properly, Sir. Are you going to dictate how I talk to people? You'll be the one messing up at work and... I'll be abused by the clients... And I can't tell you anything... What do you think of yourself? I have told you so many times... If you really want to write, stay home and write. Don't waste company's time like this. You want to have it all... But you don't want to work for it... It's Ms. Ria, right? I want to see your resignation letter on my table, tomorrow morning. After that... You can go home... And write your book... It doesn't matter to me... Don't waste the company's resources... It really hurts me... You have no idea how romantic this is... I mean... The story might not be anything new but... But it's so beautifully presented... After reading it, you'll start believing that everything is possible in love... Love can make you forget all the suffering, longing, heartache... And... Will you please shut up?!? Don't you have anything better to do than reading these romantic novels? Life is not a romantic novel, okay! You have to work your ass off to get two square meals a day. And in trying to do that... Their hopes and dreams die and no one even cares... But what is that to you? You don't have to worry about any of this... No hunger, no sleep. Even your clothes change by themselves. All you have to do is sit at home, read romantic novels and irritate your wife. You don't have any responsibilty. You can see that I'm really worked up after office... Even then you have to talk about this rubbish. I was upset about something else... Didn't mean to... It's good in a way. I hope all the anger is out. Okay, you don't have to smile. Please sit down... Please sit. What happened, Ria? Why? He thinks my writing is getting in the way of my work. I'm not performing well... Ria, why are you giving so much importance to what that man says? This is what all bosses do. They will give you targets, scare you, insult you to put pressure. Let it go. You just wait and watch. Your books will be bestsellers in two years. Then you won't have to work for anybody. That's later. What do I do now? Ria, I don't know if you would believe me. But I had planned that... I would ask you to quit your job after the wedding. I would tell you to write full time... I would have managed the household expenses... As your husband, this is the least I can do to support you. If I was alive, Ria... I wouldn't let that guy insult you, ever. You would have thrown your resignation letter at him... I can only give you emotional support. Ria, listen. I have a plan to make you feel better. What? No, no... Why would I mind? This... That we are talking on the street... That you are right about... That's why I wanted to... Ria, I was told that you are resigning today. Yes! Ria is resigning today. I see you in front of me But are you real or an illusion? The more I see you The more it puts my life in confusion I am thinking but I can't find any solution What should I do? Helpless, I'm stuck, I'm messed up I have to take a few decisions in my life A little bit of mystery is good Feels good to be suddenly caught in love Everything is unknown in love People say there's no limit to knowing A little bit of mystery is good Feels good to be suddenly caught in love Everything is unknown in love People say there's no limit to knowing My tiny, dilapidated, hidden self Is hurt when it gets caught Either it just shows up or I keep it locked in a safe But it still gets caught What should I do? I am not like myself anymore I am changing, evolving, I'm gone, gone, gone A little bit of mystery is good Feels good to be suddenly caught in love Everything is unknown in love People say there's no limit to knowing A little bit of mystery is good Feels good to be suddenly caught in love Everything is unknown in love People say there's no limit to knowing A little bit of mystery is good Feels good to be suddenly caught in love Everything is unknown in love People say there's no limit to knowing A little bit of mystery is good Feels good to be suddenly caught in love Everything is unknown in love People say there's no limit to knowing How are you going to go home so late? I'll walk it. And it's very late too... We are here... This is where I live... What's the matter? Where were you? Why are you so late? Ria, is everything okay? Why do you look so upset? What happened? Have you given them your resignation letter? They didn't accept it. Wow! This is great news! Then why are you so upset? I'm really tired... I'm really sleepy... Let's talk in the morning? Yeah? Yes, I'm home. Do you want to come over? Okay, come over. Listen, Ria... Life gives a second chance to very few people. You are extremely lucky that you have got a second chance... -Jhumpa, I had told you before... -Yeah, what did you tell me? I had told you that... That Deb is here... Yes... Deb! Deb is here. Where? Please call him. I want to meet him. Please call him. -He is right here. -Eh? Here? So, what I wanted to tell you... I can be a little informal with you, right? So, what I was trying to tell you is... Brother, you are not alive anymore... And you are still staying with my friend here, for days now... And because of that, her life has stopped. She can't move on. That's why if you can let her go... -Shut up. -See, Ria... I've said whatever I wanted to say. I hope he understood what I said. You have to understand that... Whatever I said you will... Think about it, Ria... Please, at least, think about what I just said. Your friend is right, Ria. See... The minimum requirement to have a family life is to be alive... I'm not alive anymore, Ria. I'm done. I'm finished. But you are still alive. Your entire life is ahead of you. Why do you want to ruin your life because of me? See, Ria... You can't live alone for the rest of your life. Everyone needs a companion to go through life, right? If someone new walks in... Ria, if you make a new friend today, what is the problem with that? Please, think about it. How old are you? Your entire life is ahead of you. There are so many dreams to fulfill. Just because of me... Why are you wasting your life? I am not here. But please... Don't stop yourself like this. Start your new life. Mom, I'll call you later. Boss is here. And I have a lot of work. Bye. I didn't know about your husband's death. So, what's problem? See, Vikram just thinks of me as a widow whose husband has recently passed away. And now if I flirt with him, he will think I'm a tramp... And he'll fire me immediately. He won't even ask me to resign. You are right. Do what I say. Vikram considers you just a widow, right? Yes, now use it to your advantage. You be the oppressed, tortured, sad woman in front of Vikram. Be emotional all the time. And pretend that you need a strong shoulder for to cry on... And who will also give you emotional support. You keep chanting Deb's name in front of Vikram. Cry about Deb. Keep telling him about Deb's likes and dislikes all day. Then you just watch Vikram extend his strong shoulder towards you. And then from emotional drama you move on to love story just like that. But there's a problem. Now what? I don't know enough about Deb to talk about him to Vikram. He committed suicide on our wedding night. I haven't spent enough time with him to feel emotional. Why? You only told me that Deb's soul is back... Ask his soul about everything... Sit. How was your day? Can I ask you something? Ask away. What do you like to eat? What happened? What happened? This was my husband Deb's favourite. Now, just look at it. All alone on the plate. Who will share this with me now? How was the biryani? Extraordinary! So... Tell me more about yourself. What do you like? Where do you like to travel? What do you like wearing? What do you like doing? And you know what, I love travelling to the mountains... I had thought... What did he think? Deb had thought we will go to a hill station for our honeymoon. No hill station or honeymoon for me... For our next holiday... Can we go together? For honeymoon? No... Just to take some time off. You have no idea what you've done for me. One minute... Slow down... Let me first get over the shock. What is up with you today? You directly went to "I love you"... I can see that. Any good news? Nothing like that. Let's sit down. Let's go. Now, tell me what the good news is. Oh, there's no good news... Tell me what kind of music you like? English or Bengali? Why do you want to know about music suddenly? Just like that. Tell me. I'm really happy today. So, I can ask you anything. Today is my day. Now, tell me. So, what kind of music do I like? Old Hindi movie songs... I love them. Me too. You sing... Why me? You were great... I can't sing... Why can't you? You sang beautifully the day you came over to see me... You sing really well. You have to sing with me. No, no, that was the first day, it just happened. Please, I can't... You were singing so well... Today, it's your turn... Which song? Who? Who? Who should I love? How can I love? You are here... I had never imagined That a day like this would come... When water will burn And stones will melt... Watch out... Who can be better than you? That's it? Songs over? You don't know anymore songs? No, no more songs. Bye. Sayonara, sayonara I'll keep my promises... Dancing and meandering, I will meet you tomorrow again... Life after life We will be together I have come back a hundred times for you... Life after life We will be together I have come back a hundred times for you... I have come back a hundred times for you... Deb loves this song. Even Bob Dylan's father could not have written this. Why are you saying this? So, what according to you is good music? Do you want to hear it? But what is the problem if someone likes that song? Your mom had come today. -When? -In the afternoon. Then? Nothing... She rang the bell for a while. She left when no one answered. Tell me, Ria... Why don't you tell your mother... I mean, you can stay there for a couple of days.. If I go back there, they will start talking about my marriage again. You should also start thinking about it. What? Think about remarrying... Ria, I've told you before also... Your entire life is ahead of you. Why do you want to waste it? My death cannot be undone. I... Have become a soul whose only job is to be around you... This is... I don't know why but I have a feeling that... I should go back. Why? Where do you want to go? No, no, I... I don't know that. Suddenly, I had a very strong feeling... This way... I have to go, Ria... No! You can't go anywhere... Do you understand? You are going to stay here with me, forever. Okay, okay, I'm not going anywhere. I just told you because I felt... But what happened to you? What happened... I know I was wrong about whatever I said last night. He is with me. He can't go anywhere without me. This is nothing... This is just a door. Nothing beyond it. Just a wall. You can't go in. You can't go in without permission. Where's my husband? Where have you kept Deb? Who are you? You are asking the king of Yamlok himself who he is... You are Yamraj? Yes, I am the king of Death! But last time I met someone else. You have... You might have... I have recently taken up charge here. What do you mean? How can Yamraj be changed? So, what do you think? We don't have elections here like you have on Earth? And I have changed all the rules around here... From now, it's my way or the high way. So, yes. I have brought your husband's soul back. Are we joking here? You can't take someone's soul back just like that... All the fooling around stops now. You may leave now. I am not leaving without Deb. You think this is a joke? "I am not leaving without Deb". The door's that way... I told you. I will only leave with Deb. And if I don't give him back? If you don't give him back, then I will also not leave. What do mean by you won't leave? -I'll push you out. -Go ahead and try. No one can move me an inch from here until Deb is returned to me. Listen, throw this woman out of here. What the... What happened?!? It's okay. Please leave. -Okay, Yamraj. -I'll do it myself. You are so determined! Oh my God! Okay! Okay! These guards are useless. They have built their bodies on supplements. Okay... I will give you your husband Deb Das back. But... But, but, but, but... I have a condition. What is the condition? You will get your husband's soul today. But the condition is... Within the next seven days... You'll have to confess to him what you did on your wedding night. You have to tell him... That you are responsible for his death... And even after knowing this... If he still wants to stay with you... Then I have nothing to say. But after knowing the truth... If he doesn't want to stay with you... Then... Automatically, he will come back to me... Then there will be nothing left for me to do. Okay. Now, you can go back home, without any worry... Tonight at 12 minutes and 12 seconds past 12, your husband will be standing in front of you. Now, your husband will stay with you or without you... That's completely upto you. Hey... What is this? Honeymoon package for Darjeeling. You don't want to go? But you said you liked hills. Tell me honestly. Have you fallen in love with me? 25 years in Rippon Street. 17 years in Darjeeling. I am the host of your honeymoon trip. This 7 days, 6 nights honeymoon package that you have... The first day we will play some interesting couple games in different locations. And for the next four days... You will be sightseeing, shopping, eating, etc... Okay? The first couple game that we are going to play is... The DDLJ Train Chase game! I'll explain it. In a short while, a toy train will arrive at this station. All the husbands will board the train... Only the husbands... The wives will remain on the platform. Once the train starts, I'll blow my whistle... And each wife will start running towards their husband... And then at the right time, the husbands will pull their wives into the train compartment. I am hoping all the wives will be running towards their own... There it is... Why are you alone? I am not alone... You are a writer, right? You write? Yes. I guessed right. All writers are, more or less, mad. Everyone take your positions. Practice if you want... The game will start in no time... Please be careful... Wonderful! Very good! Let's go... Can you hold my hand to get up on the train? You cannot... But I can let the train go for you... What's the matter? You are writing in your diary. I thought I will document everything I did or didn't do today. Whatever you didn't do today, you can always do it tomorrow. What if there is no time left? What if I can't do it? There's nothing that you can't do... I am here with you. Hope you had a good time yesterday. Hope you enjoyed yourselves. This couple game has a Bengali name. Give and take... Basically the wives will cook their husbands' favourite dish. Then, once the bonfire starts... Husbands will sing in appreciation of their wives. Is that clear? Then can we begin? Hey, can you hear me? Can you count the stars in the sky? This night is a cover for you and I And you touch me with your hands drenched in dew The way you walk, the way you stop The way you forget, what you really want You too love me, in any garb I am But you shy away from yourself If you can keep me, I'll stay Don't let me go away If you can keep me, I'll stay Don't let me go away If we can be even closer If I can make your dreams come true When your feet touch the grass I feel at a loss The path that you walk, the way you stop The way you forget, what you really want You too love me, in any garb I am But you shy away from yourself If you can keep me, I'll stay Don't let me go away If you can keep me, I'll stay Don't let me go away Aren't you sleepy? These few days, I want to stay up and spend time with you. Don't want to sleep. The path that you walk, the way you stop The way you forget, what you really want You too love me, in any garb I am But you shy away from yourself If you can keep me, I'll stay Don't let me go away If you can keep me, I'll stay Don't let me go away You don't want to go home? Where were you? What do you mean? I was right here, all this time. You are the one who looks lost. You haven't spoken to me since we've been back. You are not answering my questions either. Tell me, I am all ears... I don't know how to tell you this... What happened, Ria? There's something I have to tell you... But I can't find the courage. Okay. If you can't tell me then let it be. You don't have to tell me. No, no, I have to tell you before it's 12 o'clock. What is supposed to happen at 12? Nothing. Do one thing... You are uncomfortable saying it to me, right? Just turn around. And start talking. No! I want to say these things looking at you. Just can't find the courage. Why don't you turn around and see... You'll find me there. And you will find courage too. Turn around. What did I tell you? I am in front... Now, please be quiet and listen to what I have to say.. Then say whatever you want to say. Please tell me. When I... Got to know that... You've never been in a relationship before... I never wanted you to... That's it. That's all I wanted to say. Are you still here? You... Because of me... Because of my impulsive decision... Because of my mistake... You committed suicide and... Have you really forgiven me? That clock is an hour late. When you were pacing up and down because you thought it was 11.30... Because you had confess in half an hour... It was actually 12.30 already... And that's why I gave you the option of not telling me also... You already knew? I didn't know when I committed suicide. I found out later. When I was taken to the new Yamraj... I was reading a novel in the evening... You were still at the office... Suddenly, there was a sound at the door... A man wearing strange clothes and sunglasses in the evening came in... He was looking for something, you know... "One pill"... "Can turn an elephant into a mouse". This means... That man died because of these pills. And I thought... I am permanently impotent. No, no. No, no the wife has to be.. Put behind bars... Got it! I'm not going to be the sidekick anymore... From now on I'll be the lead detective. You need to use the bathroom. Yes... You really need to use the bathroom right now. If you don't relieve yourself now, all hell will break loose. Where did it go? It was right here. What the... What's happening? Yes, Sir! Even after knowing everything, I want to go back. Please tell me why. I agree that Ria could have spoken to me... None of this would have happened if we just discussed the issue. I also agree that she made a huge mistake by giving me those impotency pills but... Sir, I am equally at fault. Your fault? What is your fault? She is the one who mixed the pills in the milk. You are the victim here. No, Sir. I... I could have also waited a little... Actually, I didn't know Ria that well then. Didn't understand her at all. I was really desperate that first night. I mean... To get physically intimate I... See, it's my mistake. I should have spoken to her... I should have tried to get to know her better... I should have asked for her permission... Sir.. It's my fault too... So, please send me back. It's almost time for Ria to get back from office. She'll be very worried if she doesn't find me home. Sir? I don't think I can stay without her. First of all, stop calling me sir. I'm not your sir. I am Yamraj! Again? Now I know how much you love her. But I also want to see... Does Ria also loves you this much? And will she come to take you back? And after that... Does she have the courage to tell the truth? Let me see that first. Then, you'll see, things will fall into their place. Sir, how is this possible? How is Ria touching Deb? He is a soul. You will always remain Chitragupta because you can't rise above the logic... You idiot, she still can't touch Deb. She thinks she can touch Deb. Her emotions, her feelings are touching Deb's. They can feel each other... Who is this now? -Sir, this is the police sidekick. -Is he dead or alive? According to my calculations, he is still alive. How did he get in here? Go, get him! Catch him. Don't let him escape... Hit him on the head! You have written this book?!? And even when a person passes away, their love stays alive. Who is it? Is it you? Aww... So cute... So much love! You know what? I really feel like returning the body too... But... There's a technical problem with that. His body has already been cremated. Then how will you do it? Slap this old fool for me! He is ruining the romance here. -Yes, sir! -I'll beat you black and blue...
