Hey. Hey. Do you need a ride? No, I'm good. My boyfriend's picking me up. Okay. Hey, Phil. Hey, you ready? Yeah. And remember, life is a precious gift and you have so much of it ahead of you. If you're ever feeling lost or hopeless, please talk to someone. This school is a safe space and the faculty's doors are always open. Jane will remain in our hearts now and always. It's so sad. You think she's okay? Of course not. They were best friends. Josa, I've been loving your show. Thank you. Can't wait for the next episode. It's so great we're doing this. My co-stars and I have been UNICEF ambassadors for a while. We actually got to visit their emergency relief site in Honduras. It's so important. Yeah. Also, college interviewers have been eating it up. Thanks, Josa. Thank you so much! Can I grab a cookie? -Oh yeah. -Yeah. Why do only two Greenwood students get into Stanford each year? Olivia, hi! How are you? Only Riya and Alyssa got in last year. Well, it varies from year to year, depending on the class. And only two got in the year before that. Yes, but it's not a steadfast rule. Look, don't get caught up in all this quota nonsense. Okay. How many girls applied early action this year? Olivia, you've had a rough few months. Right now, you just need to start focusing on yourself. Your application is strong, you're a smart young woman, and you're gonna get in somewhere great. Not somewhere. Stanford. Hey, welcome back. O Captain! My Captain! -Hey, Richardson. -How you doing, Champ? -I'm good. -Yeah? Ready to kick some Oceanview butt? -You know it! -Alright, let's do it. My opponent is goin' to get up here and tell you that the only way America can survive this competitive global landscape is by looking inwards and cutting off all foreign philanthropic efforts. But I'd like to remind you that our aid, the wells we built in Somalia, the schools we set up in Afghanistan, and the doctors we sent to earthquake ravaged Haiti is the only thing helping us maintain a positive image in this world. This is America, land of the free, home of the brave, and protectors of the disenfranchised. Let's remind everyone that we truly believe that. Thank you. Hmm, great job in there. -Thanks. -Yes. You're gonna have room for another trophy? I think I can find a place. Was my second speech okay? I felt like I flubbed it in the middle and I really didn't hit that last-- -No, you didn't! -Hi, Mr. R! Oh, hey, Camille. Alright, great, this is perfect. I wanted to introduce you to Olivia. She is our stellar debate team captain. Olivia, this is Camille. Hi. It's so, so nice to meet you. She just transferred from Fairstone High in New York and she's gonna be joining our debate team. Yay. Yeah. Great. So I'm gonna introduce you to the rest of the team. -Yeah? -Yeah, sounds good. See you. Yeah. Hi, Sweetie, how was your day? It was fine. We won the tournament. Oh. That is great. Well, that debate stuff is gonna look amazing on your college apps. Yeah, Stanford admission guys definitely have a hard on for those trophies. Uh, please, let's not talk about college, hard ons, and my daughter while I'm trying to eat. Oh my God, Dad, please. -Your mom started first. -Mm-mm. You know, anyways, this food is very good, Dad. Thank you. - Oh, you're so welcome. - Hmm. Change the subject. It is good, it's great. Thank you. It's not the end of the world. I'm always here to talk through your options. Getting accepted in the spring is still a possibility. Consider submitting a letter to the admissions board. What kind of letter? Well, students sometimes have success with personal appeals. Okay, I'll do that. Don't let this define you. We could discuss that. Yeah, that'd be great. Yeah. Perfect. Like after practice or something. Yeah, that's like perfect. -Cool. -Cool. Oh. Alright! Afternoon, everyone. By now we've all met Camille. So let's give her a warm welcome for her first team practice. -Hey. -Hey. Hi, guys. Thank you so much. Okay, we're gonna divide up into practice groups, so Camille, why don't you join up with Olivia for today? Sounds good. Alright, let's have Debbie with Sydney, and Crystal with Amelia. Let's run the case. I won my last couple of tournaments on this topic, but I'm happy to look over your arguments. Thanks, but obviously I won, too, so I don't really think that's necessary. Right. I'm-- I'm talking about real tournaments with more than just a couple of schools attending. I took notes during your last debate. We could start with that. Why don't you just read what I have? Um, I don't remember seein' you at Nationals last year. I just think that this team could really benefit from my leadership. Are you feeling okay? I'm happy to help you out anytime! Fuck you! Olivia! Olivia. Olivia, can you hear me? You okay? Okay, practice is over for today. We'll-- we'll pick it up tomorrow. Here, try to drink some water. I'm sorry. Hey, I understand that this has been a really tough time for you, but that doesn't make it okay to disrespect a teammate. But she started it. I think it's best if you sit out this weekend's tournament. No, please, Richardson. Olivia, you're under a lot of stress, okay? It's just one competition. Take the opportunity to decompress. Are you fucking kidding me? Hey. Hi. Looks like you can use a ride. Thanks again. Hey, Liv. I, um... I miss her, too. Thanks. Sweetie, it'll be okay. It's a deferral, it's not a rejection. I know you'll turn this around, you'll get accepted in the spring. Yeah, they'd be idiots not to have you. I don't know. I mean I'm filling in as Captain this weekend, but I'm pretty sure Richardson's gonna make it permanent. I mean she literally passed out during practice. It's just kinda sad, you know. Oh my God, that's so sad. The next thing you know, she's gonna pass out during the debate. Well, I've been wanting to see that, but only if I was on the other team, so... Hey. Whoa. Did you-- did you see? N-- never mind. Okay. Anyways uh, do you need a ride again? Um no, I'm-- I'm fine, thanks. I fixed my car. Cool. Actually... Yeah? Would you wanna get a coffee or something? Uh... Um, no-- no pressure if you're busy. No, I don't have anything. Let's do it. Okay. Wow, this girl sounds like the worst. You're not wrong. I am so over high school politics, I'll kill myself if I don't get in somewhere soon. I, uh... I didn't mean... No, I know. Who the hell transfers beginning of senior year anyway? You said this girl went to Fairstone High? Uh, yeah, I think it's in New York. Wait, shut the fuck up. What? The dates line up. It's the same school, it's Camille. There's no way to know that. Wait, did this girl frame her teacher? Yes! You have so much on her now. No one just moves across the country for no reason. Um, okay. What do you want me to do? Just like go up to her in the middle of debate practice and be like, "Hey, heard you fake fucked your teacher?" No. You don't have to publicly shame her. just let her know that you're onto her little secret and force her to back off. Easy. Isn't that what you wanted? I don't know. What if it's not even true? Um, I have to get some work done, but it was nice to hang. Yeah, it was, uh... It was good to see you. Thanks for um, letting me vent. For what good is a structure without its foundation? When every insignificant thought is published for the worlds at a click of a button, does it not rock that very foundation? A beginning implies the start of a journey, but as ideas, photos, and more become increasingly ephemeral, that journey's length becomes truncated. No longer is the beginning a substantial step for the world. I cannot believe you found this. We got lucky. She was already 18 when it happened. What are you gonna do? I don't know. Do you have any ideas? Mm... I mean you should find some way to mess with her head a bit. Honestly, you should DM her and let her know that you know. Oh, that's way too risky. I wish there was a way we could do it anonymously. You could, mm... I mean you could make a new Connect profile. She'd have no idea. That is perfect. I know. I think I left my bag in my car. Do you have your computer? Shit, um, I left it at school. Oh, but I do have my old one. - Okay. - Hang on. Oh, bingo. Okay. What? How did you... She must have logged on last time she was over. I haven't used this laptop in months. Well, I mean Camille doesn't know her. That's kinda fucked up. Aren't we tryin' to mess with her head? Honestly, Jane would have loved this. You're right. She totally would. Plus, there's no way she'd know it was us. Okay. Okay, fine. Fine, I'm in. -I'm in. -Okay. How about "Don't think we haven't noticed you throwing yourself at Mr. Richardson. Guess old habits die hard."? Well? Perfect. -Okay, bye. -See you later. "Your rye-straw hats put on and these fresh nymphs encounter-- The minute of their plot is almost come. Well done. Avoid. No more." Isabelle, please continue. "This is strange. Your father's in some passion that works him strongly. Never till this day saw I him touched with anger, so distempered." No way. Maybe there's something on Connect? -Her profile's not there. -What? Wait, we were just messaging with her this morning. Shit. You don't think she knows it's us, do you? Oh no, we'd be in Rhode's office by now. Liv, but isn't this what you wanted? -I don't know. -Don't over think it. This is a good thing. Mission accomplished. Hey Richardson, do you have a sec? Yeah, of course. What's up? I just-- I wanted to apologize for my behavior last week. I've been thinking a lot about the team and more than anything, I really wanna do my part to make it the best that it can be. Even if that means sharing leadership with Camille. I'm glad to hear you say that. I really think we can find a way to combine our strengths and work together. NatQuals is just around the corner and with a little more effort, I know we can get the team to Nationals. Well, I... I really appreciate the go-get-'em attitude, but unfortunately Camille decided that Greenwood wasn't a good fit, so she's no longer a student here. Oh no, I'm-- I'm so sorry to hear that. Is there anything else you wanna talk about? Um, no. Okay. Well, I'm here if that changes. Okay, thanks. See you at practice. Okay. Are you sure there isn't a sample letter you can show me? Olivia, this is supposed to be a personal appeal. Other students' letters won't work. Well, what's the right message? There must be something that they're looking for. Just draw from important moments in your life. I mean nothing in your first draft feels uniquely you. What's something that they wouldn't already know from your application? Send me your next draft and we can go from there. Oh my God. I have to say, Ladies, I'm pretty disappointed. Let's hope next week's papers are more coherent. ...beginning, I-- I just couldn't fathom the words that were coming out of her mouth. Hey. Hey! Anyways, she really went and gave us a big huge massive paper. I'm like, "Mrs. West is legitimately the worst teacher and I-- I just don't understand." No. Yeah, she's trying to sabotage-- Nope. No way. Mrs. West probably doesn't even have a Connect. Look. Oh. Okay, that's pretty sad. Yeah. But we can't. Well, she knew Jane. And Jane hated her. And don't you think we'd be pushing our luck? She has such a bullshit holier-than-thou attitude. We have to show people how shitty West is. Okay, yes, that's true. She probably wouldn't give an A if her life depended on it. And she made Jane's life a living hell. Oh, now this... This would look so good on you. Uh-huh. -Take it. -Okay. Yeah. Okay. Oh no. Alright. Um... One of these better work for tonight. What's tonight? I'm going to a party with Phil. He's been acting like so weird lately. Oh. I'm sorry that's annoying. Yeah. No, I don't like this. Oh. Okay, come here. Oh! I like this a lot. -Really? -Yeah. Should we like double cuff it? I don't know. Oh, okay. You know, there's no way she'd know it was us. She's a teacher. A private message is not gonna do anything. Well, I do have an idea. On June 28th, 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie were assassinated on a visit to Sarajevo. This may seem like a small moment, but Ferdinand was the heir to the Austro-Hungarian empire. His death was the final straw, fracturing Europe and starting World War I. What's so funny? Okay, hilarious, Ladies. Can we please focus? Ha, ha, ha, very mature. If you cannot use your computers responsibly, you cannot use them. Oh! That's it! Close your computers, turn off your phones! What-- What the hell? -That's it! -Hey! What are you doing, you entitled bitches? Stop it! Mia, what are you typing? -Give me that computer. -Let-- let go! It's been re-posted like 100 times. Yeah. People are super freaked out. Honestly, it's a nice break from talking about college acceptances. -Seriously? -Mmhmm. By the way uh, where are you applying? Uh, top choice is still Stanford. We'll see. Right, right. Duh. Well, I'm sure you'll get in. These headlines are insane. "Student posthumously exposes abuse in the classroom. Elite LA private school's mysterious scandal." Wait, her Connect is gone. She must have deleted it. Those headlines are kinda harsh. She's kinda harsh. Jane is just exposing people for who they really are. Yeah. To Jane. To Jane. Who is behind Jane? I can't believe someone would do that. I know, right? It's kind of fucked. It's kind of awesome. Good morning, ladies. I'd like to talk about what happened yesterday. While I don't condone Mrs. West's behavior, I also do not condone tampering with school computers, publicly antagonizing teachers, and most of all, using a former student's internet presence to do so. Whoever is behind this, needs to take a hard look at themselves and think about how their actions might have triggered people. Our community is only as strong as you make it. Either one of you volunteers information or I will sit down with everyone individually. Olivia. Well, we all saw the same thing I think. It seemed like someone was playing a prank with the projector. It was rude, but pretty harmless. But-- but then, Mrs. West started yelling and grabbing our personal belongings. She really overreacted. It was pretty scary to see a teacher lose control like that. I don't know how it got on Jane's page, though. That was really upsetting. Thank you for your honesty. We never want our students to feel unsafe. Mrs. West is no longer a member of our faculty. However, she was a well-regarded member of our community for over a decade. It's my responsibility to get to the bottom of this. Hmm? Wow! Jane has 10,000 followers. Wow, that-- that's a serious platform. She'd be obsessed! That wasn't really her thing. If you say so. So, who's next? Did you see what Jane just posted? Early bird gets the worm! -Alright! -Hey. Don't think I haven't noticed all this hard work you're puttin' in. It's good to have our captain back. Thanks. This one about Jenny is so sad. "It's easy to make it look like you have a boyfriend when you crop their actual girlfriend out of the group photos." Nice. Wait, what? I thought you wrote that? Huh? I'm pretty sure it wasn't me. I know it wasn't me. No one else has access to Jane, right? Of course not. We changed her password. I haven't told anyone. Neither have I. Okay. Um, let's just think about this. I remember you talking about Jenny in the car last week. Maybe you posted it then without thinking. Yes, whatever. It's not even that big of a deal. Okay. Um, why don't we just come up with a rule where we only post when we're together? It's more fun that way anyway, right? Sure. Hey. I-- I just decided this morning. Congrats. I didn't know you were applying early, too. Yeah, yeah, it was super last minute. Any news? Deferred. I really hope we get to go together. It's what she would have wanted. Getting tough on teachers will increase the overall quality of education, and uh, and in turn will provide a strong uh, foundation for the growth of our country. Thank you. In a unanimous decision, we've decided to vote in favor of the negation. The Lynley School wins the final round. Hey, how are we doing, Champ? I'm okay. Closing argument was bullshit. Oh, hey, great job today, guys. Really, I mean uh, I think we know what we need to do in order to get ready for the National Qualifications, yeah? Yeah. So let's just prep hard, let's get it done. Yeah. Uh, before I let you go, though, Principal Rhodes asked the faculty to talk to the students about the whole Jane business. Obviously, cyber bullying is not cool but this is a whole another level of messed up. So if it's bringin' up anything difficult for you, I'm here. You know, I hope you guys aren't mixed up with this shit-- stuff. So uh, okay. That's it for today. I'll see you tomorrow. Hey. I don't want things to be weird again. So uh, look what I snagged. Can I come in? Sure, come on. Oh my God! The basketball team! Those uniforms were not a good look. No. Remember-- How we would go to the pizza parlor across the street and we'd shorten our skirts just in case we saw any cute boys. That was just you and Jane. Oh well, it was pathetic. Hmm. You have to come at this party with me. What party? It's at Phil's house. I don't wanna get into it, but uh... We broke up this week. I'm so sorry. I had no idea. Look what I got you. You can wear this. Um... -Wooh! -Ooh. Voilà. -Hmm, it's cute. -Um, I-- I-- I-- I don't think so. Please, don't make me go alone. Please, please. Please, please, please, please. Welcome. I need a drink. Josa knows Phil? Uh, she's always at these things. Wait, what? Fuck. We literally just broke up. Everyone thinks she's as sweet and wholesome as that character she plays on her TV show, but she's really not. You know, the whole time Phil and I were together, she was flirting with him and all the boys in his frat. But you wanna know a secret? She totally has a coke problem. -No way. -Yes way. Fuck it. We just need to go dance. Let's have a good time, okay? Okay. Yeah, there you go. There you go, come on. It's okay. Izzy, hey! Oh my God! Hey. -Josa. -You okay? Um, yeah-- How about you mind your own business? Well, let me know if you need anything. Come on. Come here. Perfect. Oh my God, I cannot stand how she's roamin' around here acting like she's better than everybody else. Well, she's not. It's so fake. Tell that to Phil. Maybe Jane could say something. I wish. No one would believe it. She has too many fans. We'd just look like another stupid internet troll. Whatever. I'm just happy I won't have to see any of them in the fall. On a more fun note-- Do you want one? What is that? Molly. -Since when do you-- -It's harmless. It only lasts a few hours, okay? And I usually don't, but it seemed like a special occasion. Come on, don't be nervous! It'll cheer us up and give you enough energy to get back up on the dance floor. Wait a minute! What? What if we slip some to Josa? What? Yeah. It'll show everyone how she's not so perfect. No. Really? Damn. Okay, Liv. Okay. Fuck. One for you. One for me. And a little extra for our guest of honor. Yeah, I'm obsessed with you, Josa. No. Yeah. Can't stop watching the show. Yeah, I know. Oh my gosh, I am so sorry for being such a bitch earlier. Um, it's okay. I was just really worried about Olivia and I snapped. I feel much better now. Thank you for caring. Um, do you want one? I just really needed a break from alcohol and this is all I could find. Thanks, I'm parched. - Me, too. - Yeah. -Cheers! -Cheers! Oh yeah, that's so good. Let's finish these up and dance! -Hmm, hmm, hmm. -Yeah. -Hmm, hmm. -Yeah, yeah. Hmm. -Mm. -Mm. -Mmhmm. -Mmhmm. Come on. ♪ I love you, guys! So much! Tonight is fucking amazing! My heart is racing. Hey guys, is your heart racing? I guess we danced a lot, huh? Josa! Josa, come here! She's right, though, this is amazing! Oh no. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm really happy right now. This is the happiest I've felt in a really long time. Same. These past few months have really sucked. I know. I really miss her. Are you mad at me? What? No! I love you. I love you, too, but... Are you mad at me? I should have told you about Stanford. I just... I wish you hadn't disappeared. I didn't know what else to do. Neither did I. But before... -You left us behind. -I didn't leave. I didn't leave. I don't know, let's just say everything was changing and I thought you guys had each other. I just want things to go back to normal again. Me, too. I'm really happy we're friends again. -Yeah. -Me, too. I missed you, Izzy. Call 911 or something. Someone get help! Yo, cut the music. Call 911. Josa? Oh my God! Help! I don't know. Let's get out of here. Everybody, out! Fuck, out! Izzy. Izzy? - Oh my God. - Oh, I'm sleeping. No, you need to see this. What the hell? Why would you post this? I didn't. Then how did it end up there? I-- I-- I really don't know. We agreed not to post anything after she got sick. Uh, maybe you blacked out? Where did that video even come from? We didn't film that shit. - This is bad. - Yeah. You swear you didn't tell any of your friends about Jane? Of course not, I'm not an idiot! Okay, well, I didn't tell anyone either. Obviously. Okay, well, if you didn't tell anyone and I didn't tell anyone, then who did? I have no clue. Okay. Okay, um, no more posting until this blows over, okay? Actually, we-- we should just delete the whole profile. Delete her? It's not even her anymore. Fine. -It's not working. -Give it to me. It's done. Um, I-- I have to go. Text me later? Hey hon, how was your night? Fine. You look awful. Thanks, Mom. You hungry? I'm makin' your favorite. Uh, I'm good. I'm just gonna nap and then power through some college apps. You should really soak up whatever you drank with some food. By the way, Livi, I got an email from your school. Something about Jane and a cyber-bully. Parents have been asked to notify your principal if they see or hear anything. Is there anything you wanna talk about? No. Well, make sure you stay away from that stuff. You know, last year a bunch of kids lost their college acceptances because of dumb shit they posted online. It stays around forever, it's not worth it. But I know you know that. How the hell could it have possibly been reactivated? I have no idea. Attention, A block Seniors, please report to the library student lounge immediately. It has come to my attention that a serious incident took place on Saturday evening at a non-school affiliated event attended by Greenwood students. One of your classmates has been hospitalized after being slipped 150 milligrams of the drug MDMA. That student is still in intensive care. Obviously, this is a deeply upsetting situation, made worse by the fact that footage of the attack was posted by the Connect profile known as "Jane". An account I know you are all familiar with. Over the coming week, I will sit down with each and every one of you to get to the bottom of the video post, as well as whoever is manipulating the account. I assure you severe consequences will land on any student who has hurt our community or Jane's memory. Bet Stanford won't take Josa after this. No, her parents can claim she was drugged, but I hope she applied to a safety. I can't believe this is happening. I keep trying to delete the page over and over again, it just keeps coming back. It m-- it must be some kind of glitch or something. No, but that-- Let's just get our story straight, okay? Sure. Um, okay. Um, we-- we were at the party. Um, we-- we hung out with Josa. We didn't see anything suspicious and we-- we don't know anything about who's using Jane, right? Right. I can't believe I let you talk me into this. We did this together. Will see you tomorrow. Olivia, come in. Close the door behind you. So far these interviews have been incredibly helpful. Mm, I'm so glad. I'll dive right in. Did you have any interaction with Josa Jacobs the night of the incident? Um, I-- I spoke with her briefly earlier in the evening. Um, and I was near her when she started getting sick. Oh. Would you say you ladies were close? Not really. Did you see anything or anyone suspicious at the party? No. It seemed like everyone was supposed to be there. Did you witness anyone drinking or doing drugs? Uh, there was alcohol. I'm-- I'm not really sure about anything else. Mmhmm. And how about anyone who would want to harm Josa? Any grudges, rivalries, arguments? You know, no one's coming to mind. Everyone really seems to like her. And have you ever had any interaction with Jane's account? Uh, not since she... WOMAN 4 Is there something you wanna tell me? Anything else you wanna say? No. Olivia, your name has come up a number of times in these sessions, and I know you and Jane were very close, and I'm sure this year has been incredibly difficult for you, but now is the time to speak up. I swear I don't know anything else. Yeah, one moment. I have to take this. Hello. Yes, it's a fine time. We'll pick this up later. Yeah. Uh. Uh, yeah. Yes, the IP address responsible for the account would be great. Well, the beginning of next week would be just fine. Oh, really appreciate your help and expertise... What? Olivia. Olivia, you okay? Olivia. Feeling better? Maybe it doesn't matter if Rhodes gets the IP address. Maybe not to you, but if she does, it'll lead her right here. The first time we used the account was on my computer, at my house. Remember? I logged in on mine, too. We have to come clean. No. Yes. They're gonna find out anyways. This way we can control the story. It's not too late. I-- I'm sure that we can figure something else out. We can't keep digging ourselves in this hole. Maybe if we come clean, they'll appreciate it and they'll believe us when we say we had nothing to do with Josa. Blame it on grief. Say... Say it got out of hand. And then what? You lose Stanford? We-- we don't graduate? That's interesting. What? Where's your router? Mm, somewhere in my dad's office I think. -Why? -Be right back. What are you doing? Everything's gonna be okay. What? -How? -Your parents have a VPN. What about the IP address? When you have a VPN, it hides your IP address. They can't find us. Are you sure? 100%. Okay. Okay, great. I have to get ready for this thing. You should see yourself out. Okay. Thank you, Izzy, you've been very helpful. You're welcome. Hello, Ladies. Ah, just the one I want. Just come with me. -Oh! -I'm so sorry. No, no, it's okay. No worries. Hey, how is that letter coming along? -So far so good. -Good. Oh, s-- sorry. Hi. I um, I didn't mean to scare you. Uh, no, it's okay. Hey, can I have some black coffee, please? Thanks. -Hi. -Hi. What-- what are you doing here? Oh, my-- my mom works down the street. Do you have a few minutes to chat? Um, not really. I have to get to debate soon. Right, but you have like 10 minutes, right? Please? Sure, yeah. I'm really glad I ran into you. I've been wanting to apologize for how I acted. -Oh no, you don't have-- -No, no. I was super shitty to you. Honestly, I was dealing with a lot of fucked up stuff. But that-- that's not an excuse. Especially, ''cause you were, too. What? I-- I learned the truth about Jane. I'm so sorry. I-- I can't imagine losing a friend like that, and at the beginning of senior year. Yeah, um, it's okay. Thank you. Uh, anyway um, how are you? Like how's school? I've been reading about all this craziness. Yeah, it's been pretty wild. You know, I think I might have been one of the first victims. Yeah, whoever is using her is the reason why I got pulled out of school. Are you sure? Back home uh, there was this teacher who harassed me for about a year. Super inappropriate, weird sexual stuff. I told my parents about it, they didn't believe me. And then I went to the school and they turned it into this big thing. Because there wasn't any evidence, he made it look like I was lying. He claims that I was infatuated with him. Which is insane. But the school took his side. Then my parents made us move here and-- Yeah, they were too embarrassed to stay in New York. That's horrible. Anyway, whoever it is found out somehow and accused me of doing the same thing here. And then my mom saw the messages, and yet again, believed some stranger over her own daughter. So... I'm so, so sorry. Hey, it's not your fault, right? Right? What? Oh, you have to get to debate, right? Yeah, thanks. Hey, it was really nice seeing you. Stop! Stop! This isn't you. Stop! Hey, we need to talk. What's up? I just found out Josa got into Stanford. You didn't know that before the party, did you? No, I had no idea. Hmm, okay, ''cause it just seemed a bit coincidental. What are you trying to say? Nothing. I just had to ask. I'll see you around. Oh my God. First round starts in an hour, okay? Okay, I'ma let you all get your cases together. You got this. Yeah? Hey. Everything okay? Yeah. Yeah? Everything's great. Okay. Final Nat Quals! I'm really proud of you for rallyin' this year. Thanks. - Hi! - You're a liar. What do you mean? You lied about the VPN. I don't have a secure network. I-- I-- I didn't lie about the VPN. And I noticed you've been deleting everything you posted on Jane. I-- I haven't deleted anything I swear. What are you doing, dude? We're both in deep shit here, so if you have a plan, please clue me in. Um, Izzy, we-- we don't need a plan. Um, you-- you have a private network. You know that's bullshit. And you know what? I think you're trying to pin this all on me. I just wanted to let you know that I'm calling Rhodes now and telling her everything. Wait, Izzy, please. Um, like can we just talk about this? I can come over and we can figure out a plan on how to come clean together, okay? It's too late. Izzy? What are you doin' here? Hey, Iz. You can't just show up in my backyard anymore, this is insane. I know. Um, can we please just talk? There's nothing to talk about. You tried to frame me. Did you really think you'd get away with that? Just-- just let me explain. You're pathetic. The only person you care about is yourself. You were too self-absorbed to even notice Jane was depressed. That's not fair. You're a coward! You abandoned us! You really hurt her! You have no idea how she was feeling! And then, where were you? I needed you. All you ever do is hide behind Jane instead of dealing with your own problems! I'm just happy I won't have to see your ass at Stanford in the fall. You should leave. What the fuck! You fucking psycho! Izzy. Izzy? Izzy. Izzy! Izzy! Izzy! Izzy. Izzy. Oh, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. No, you wake up. Come on. Wake up. Please, wake up. Please, wake up. Please. Please. Please! No. Oh, please. What do I do? Come on, come on. Olivia! There you are. You're up. Let's go. To Nationals! To Nationals! Wooh! - Oh my God. - What? - Poor Izzy. - What is it? Check Connect. This can't be real. Oh, Honey. I am so sorry, Baby. Honey, if you're up for it, a few officers stopped by to ask you some questions. They're in the living room. Okay. -Okay? -Yeah. I know this is a really difficult time. We appreciate you being willing to talk with us. Did you notice any changes in Isabelle's demeanour last few weeks? Any mood swings, unusual behavior? No. I wish I could say I did. We're all under a lot of stress with college applications, but Izzy seemed to be handling it really well. I guess I thought the same thing about Jane. Well, we can never really know what's goin' on in someone else's head. Can you tell us a bit about your friendship with Isabelle? Yeah, um... ...we've been neighbors forever. We used to be best friends when we were younger. We only became close again recently. I just can't believe she would do this. She had so many people who loved her. And what about your phone call today? It was logged that she called you shortly before her time of death. What did she say? I was at a debate tournament. She called me to wish me good luck. Oh, Sweetie, don't Thank you again for your help. We're so sorry for your loss. We may get in touch again as we learn more. I'll walk you out. It's always a tragedy to lose someone so young and full of potential. And to have it happen twice in one year is truly devastating. Isabelle was such a special young woman and I know we'll all miss her dearly. As for our current students, there is always another option. We're here for you. And we'll be providing mandatory grief counseling over the coming weeks. This stops here. Now let's take a moment of silence for Izzy. Dear Stanford Admissions Committee, thank you for taking the time to reconsider my application following my deferral. I could tell you how much I've always wanted to go to Stanford, how committed I am to academic excellence, and how much time I've put into extracurricular activities, but you already know all that. Instead, I'd like to talk about my best friend, Isabelle Morris. Izzy was not only an intelligent, driven woman, but she had an undeniable charisma and an amazing ability to bring people together. She taught me how to look beyond my GPA and to connect with those around me. Izzy took her own life. I don't know why she did it. I don't know what I could have done to prevent it. But what I do know is that she left an indelible mark upon my world. When I first applied, I put down "Undeclared" on my application. Despite my extensive resume, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. Now I do. I want to help people like Izzy. I want to study mental health. I want to be there for others in the same way that Izzy was there for me. I wasn't really living my life until she took me under her wing. I vow to continue Izzy's legacy. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, Olivia Brooks.
