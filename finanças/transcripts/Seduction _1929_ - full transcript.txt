You've got so many flacons, you are worse than my daughter. Wait here until it stops raining. Do you know what? Let it rain, you can spend the night in my house. Hurry up, Andrea, I must go to work. You know that I am afraid of strangers, Father. Don't be silly, this man is no thief! Where would you go? There is no hotel in our village. Stay here. The storm must have cut off the wires. I know you shall never come back... And... What's the matter? Would you mind if I leave, Father? Do you want to visit your aunt? Very well then, go. Why do people forget so quickly? Why do people forget so quickly? I yearn for you though I know you will never return. I do not dare to die. It would kill my father if I told him. I am so helpless! I cosset it inside of me, even if I feel that my life has reached its end. I do not know why I write this letter, but I feel relief in knowing that you have not thought about me once. My poor husband is waiting for me at the theatre. What will you tell him about where you were? With my lover! You would never say that! Your key! Who is that gentleman? Where does he live? Tell him to wait! You can say whatever you wish! I know you are lying! I would not like to be in her shoes. You're impossible, you would even delude a saint! I will divorce you! Did your "little daughter" write? It is said he will soon be a grandfather! They say she tied that man who spent the night at your house. No one will dare touch the chastity of my daughter! Your child was stillborn. Perhaps it is better for you this way. How some men handle their love affairs. You see, you were here a few days longer and bed and board costs money. Wandering aimlessly. I am sending you some money, do not take everything so tragically. But you wanted to go the other way. The man who was to come for the blood transfusion is not here. Maybe I... Do you know how you got injured? Your wife saved you your life. My wife? Yes, your wife. Don't you remember? You brought her here in your car. Could you bring my wife here then? I am sorry but I can deliver this piano model only in a few weeks as I have just sold the last one. My wife. I can wait a few weeks for the other piano. Dangerous friendship. You were not home, because you knew I would come. He is a fine man. I hope he will make a good impression on you. ...And in the evening... ...In the morning... ...In the morning... ...I ask you to reject my husband's invitation. Forgive me, I should have done that myself. ...I know what pain I have caused you. You may laugh at whatever I say to apologise to you. But I love you. Have you forgiven me? Yet in the evening... I love you and I am jealous of you because you love your husband. Andrea, I want you to... Do not lie to me, he is the man who had your picture! Who? That annoying man! I do not know him at all! I will keep an eye on that gentleman! You must come with us tomorrow, we will be most pleased if you join us. If you only knew what I think of him! And what I think of you! Not even an angel could put up with you! I love you so much because you are not like other men, you are not jealous. I am not jealous, because I trust you. I have a terrible headache. I am so tired. ...I almost forgot. I will give you back your key, you will need it for someone else. On the "trip". On the "trip". Don't you think that leading a simple family life is most fortunate? Why don't you get married then? It is quite simple and easy. That is what you think! ...I think you will lose. Do you want me to lose? We did not have time to tell you that we are leaving tomorrow. It is my wife's wish. It is so nice in the south at this time of the year. Yes, it is nice, indeed. I hope to see you soon again! What kind of a comedy is this! Why aren't you sincere, Andrea? I was never more sincere as today! I think our trip will do you good, you will calm down. I am calm, but you are jealous, and you are running away like a coward! How "love" ends... Give this letter to my husband at 5 o'clock. Very well! This is the end then! You shall never see me again! Was anyone here? Will you believe me if I say that no one? To loyalty - to all women! I swear your wife is not in the room! Liar! The past that shall always be the past. Shall we go? Yes, let us go! The End
