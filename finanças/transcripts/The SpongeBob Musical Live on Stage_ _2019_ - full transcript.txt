Then again, I never really fit in Texas either. I was always the odd rodent out. No one knew what to make of a girl squirrel who was into science and martial arts. I've never felt at home anywhere, really. And now it's time to dig up my acorns again and push on. Oh, that's terrible, Sandy. But, please, don't leave.

We need you, Sandy. Patrick can help us climb that volcano, but you have to handle the stopping-it-from-erupting part. Because we have no clue how, and time is running out really, really fast. But no pressure. Pressure! Yes! I think I have an idea. Figure 1: Diagram of a volcanic eruption, caused by rapid pressure build-up in a subterranean magma chamber. Figure 2: if this pressure is released, no eruption will occur. Ipso facto, I can design an explosive device. Figure 3: to drop in the mouth of the volcano. Figure 4: with a timer set to detonate at the precise moment of eruption. Figure 5: unleashing a deluge of bubbles that'll release the pressure and prevent the blast! You lost me at 1. The point is, this could work. I reckon I can have this bubble device built by tomorrow morning. So you'll stay and help us? Boys, I'm still gonna push on from this town of yours. But you're my friends, so I say we give this idea a shot. Three heroes to the rescue! Team of tres to the top!

We're going to save Bikini Bottom! What're you talking about? Explain yourself, rhombus slacks. Sandy is going to build an ingenious bubble device to stop the volcano. Then all we have to do is climb to the top of Mount Humongous and drop it in. Ha-ha-ha-ha! You're kidding, right? Nobody has ever reached the top alive. When you say nobody, do you mean that as a figure of speech or...? I mean nobody ever, period, full stop, exclamation point. - [Gulps] - [Sniggers] Don't worry, buddy, we can do it. I'll be with you the whole way, no matter what. That sponge is the biggest threat to my plot. If somehow they do manage to climb that mountain... We have to make sure they don't live long enough to reach the top. I like how you're thinking, Karen. And I'm so glad you want to scheme with me again. It's just like the old days. I guess it took a little apocalypse to spice things up. We got this, boys. Come tomorrow, we'll be on that mountain like a smoked sausage on a hickory grill. [Sardines] Patrick Star! Patrick Star!

I'll save you! - SpooooongeBoooooob! - Paaaaaaaatriiiiiiiiiiiiick! You came back! Of course I did. I hope it's OK I borrowed your invention. Mi jetpack es su jetpack. Aw! I don't know what that means. I realized something today, buddy. The total devotion of adoring masses is pretty awesome, but they're not really there for me. Not like you are. Hey, we're BFFs. Being there for each other is what we do. We're best friends and this is the friend dance! We're best friends and this is the friend dance! - We're best friends... - This is real sweet, but the town's gonna be toast if we don't hurry up. Alright. Team, let's move! [Explosion, hissing] Boys, we have a problem. We do? Oh, you mean this giant unclimbable volcano mouth of doom. No way can I fit through those squeezes. Oh, me neither. But I bet you could, SpongeBob. Done gone it, that's right! You can squeeze through anything. Look at that thing! I can't do this. Mr. Krabs was right: - I'm just a simple sponge. - No! Remember when we were stuck inside - and there was nothing on TV? - Yeah? I thought it was an epic life-ending disaster, but you got me through it. You always see the bright side. And you never give up. When I was ready to bail on y'all, you kept me going. That's what you bring to the team, SpongeBob. Management skills. - Really? - You are manager material. And you can do this. Give me the Erupter Interrupter.

[Falling whistle] Now we wait until sundown and hope that it works. "Hope"? What do you mean, "hope"? I think my calculations are right, but as they say in Texas, the proof is in the cowpie. I love pie. We'll know for sure in ten minutes. [Distant screaming] Hey, what's that sound? It's coming from down there. They're all attacking each other! That was the Krusty Krab! [Sandy] Volcano or not, Bikini Bottom's gonna destroy itself. [Narrator] 'It's a big finale of "SpongeBob the Musical", 'live on stage. Next!' [SpongeBob] If we don't stop this, Bikini Bottom's not going to last ten more minutes. But it'll take hours to climb down. Guys, I have an idea. We could roll down. It might hurt a little. - I have an idea. - If we tuck in our heads... Pay attention to me! This jetpack, it has a parachute. - Of course! - See? My ideas are worth listening to. You can say that again. - See? My ideas are... - OK, boys! Let's do this thing! Us, go! Stoooooooop! What are you doing? Is that a rhetorical question? Quick, everyone! Those fools perished in an avalanche! We have to get into the escape pod now. Honey. They're alive. - They are? - [SpongeBob] Yes, we are. But thanks for worrying about our safety, Plankton. Seems you're the only one with some decency left. We made it to the top and dropped the bubble device into the volcano. In seven minutes, we'll know if we saved the town. But if you keep going like this, it won't matter either way. There won't be anything left to save! Deep thoughts, SpongeBob, but... I'm not finiiiiiished! At a time like this, we should be coming together. Instead, you're all looking for someone to blame or to follow... to exploit or control. You're all so scared for yourselves that you're turning against each other. That's just as dangerous as any volcano. It doesn't have to be like this. We might only have seven minutes left, but we could make them the best seven minutes ever. How? The whole town is in ruins! Like I said before, SpongeBob: the world's a horrible place filled with fear, suffering and despair. And you didn't believe me. I still don't. Just look at the sun. It's still shining. Look at the kelp. It's still... kelp-y. Look at us.
