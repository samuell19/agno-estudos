Hi. KAREN: Okay, let's put the worm in the apple. GRIDLEY: Looks beautiful, Dr. Garrett. Probe moving right on target. Hmm. Long as I don't sneeze. Did that in medical school and I turned an artery into spaghetti. I've got a node the size of a quarter. I'm going to test it before we cut through it. You don't have time, Dr. Garrett. If I don't have an uninterrupted nerve pulse in two minutes, I will die. It's your decision. GRIDLEY: Heart rate 45, 40, diastolic pressure slipping. All right, Teach recommends nerve fusion. We'll try to minimize rerouting. Bonner. Bonner, if you're not too busy! You're top gun on nerve fusion. Let's see if you can handle it. Rate dropping. Thirty-five, 30... You're losing her. She's blanking. Teach, what's wrong? TEACH 1: We're getting an unexpected chemical reaction. There are factors unknown... Failure... Fail... Quit worrying. Winston had me blank a dozen droids to see how I could cope with death. Death's easy. It's failure I can't take. PETER: Come on, I want to see you sweat. Let's go! Come on, shuffle, counter! Oh, man, you weak. Come on, my kid can tickle harder than this. Come on, push it! Push it! UP high. Up high. Fingers! Watch the fingers. Can't afford to have my best surgeon with broken knuckles. And that procedure, what was that? Surgery by the numbers? Could have used a trained monkey. Oh, come on. She was a homeostatic disaster. I did a beautiful job. Problem is your patient died. She didn't die. She'll be reprogrammed and ready for the knife in a few days. She's just a droid. And you are just her doctor. Thank you. Are you ready for another droid? Sure. Nine hundred series? Nine hundred? I didn't know there were 900s. There's just one. His skin alone is worth the price of this building. He is as close to a human being as a droid will ever be. Only thing is, I'm not sure you're ready. Oh, absolutely I'm ready. What's the case? It could make your career. What? What, what, what? His heart tissue is dying. You'd have to bring it back to life. Regenerate heart tissue? But that... That's impossible. I mean, nobody has ever done that successfully before, have they? That's why I picked you. Of course, if it's too tough, I could get Bonner. No. No. No. I won't let you down. I mean, this is... Well... Karen, one thing more. I'd like to see some compassion with this one. Get to know him. Treat him as if he's a human being. Sure. No problem. Thank you. Thank you so much. WINSTON: (ON RADIO) Fiedler! Karen's ready for her droid. You got him in? Here we go. Easy. Easy. That's it. That's it. You got it sealed? How's your back? FIEDLER: You've never been down here before, which is really a shame, so I'll explain the whole thing to you. Now, uh, what happens... What? What, what, what, what? What, Amy la sin? Amy la sin? You must be tripping. Oh, he's tripping. Oh, all right. And what else you got here? Infernon? Infernon for who? For what, for 809? Yeah, sure, listen, when Jerry Garcia sings Truckin' from the grave and not a minute before... Don't argue with me. Fiedler? My droid, please? Absolutely. Got your pre-ops, got your post-ops. You got... Oh, here's my 812. She's my birth control expert, aren't you, sweetheart? She's in a class all by herself. She's been knocked up 22 times, poor thing. No wonder she's exhausted. Ah, it's my Fred Astaire, 826. He tests brain chemistry drugs. How you freaking today, Freddy? Uppers or downers? Uppers! Yes. 905! KAREN: 905? FIEDLER: Mmm-hmm. KAREN: Are there other 900s? Not anymore. They got ripped off for spare parts. This one over here thinks he's Elvis, so I keep him under low power just to shut him up. Well, his heart's all I care about. Thanks, Fiedler. Aw, don't mention it. This is Dr. Garrett. She's going to be wanting to have her way with your... Heart. What's your first name? I prefer you call me Dr. Garrett. You can call me William. So, uh... Doc, um... Nice, easy job, I hope. Nothing too dangerous. We're going to be working miracles together. Mmm. Better give me another jolt, Fiedler. I think I'm gonna need it. Droids give our residents the experience of working on human beings without the risk. We believe that this will prove to be the ultimate system for experimental surgery. Hi. WINSTON: He's not programmed for pain, so there's no reason for him to be afraid. How do you feel, 905? Well, pain is in the mind. In my mind, this really hurts like hell. What happens when a droid dies? We call it blanking. His entire memory is erased, all the data he's gathered along the way. But his basic code remains, of course. He means I'm gonna forget all my jokes, but I'll still be funny. Okay, let's get started. Wait! Now, hold on. Whoa, whoa. Just hold on, here. I am not some lab rat that you can just carve up to boost your career. Okay? Sure you are. What? Doctors have been carving up lab animals for 200 years. That's how we learn. Karen. Karen. Was it good for you? Hi. Hi. So this operation, you've never performed it before, right? Well, not exactly. Huh? Not exactly, I see. So, what are my chances, then? About the same as, say, a quadruple bypass? Oh, much better than that. Oh, I see. But you'd bet against me, right? What are you doing in here? Having a problem with your droid, Garrett? TEACH: Mustache. What? Thank you. We'll talk about this tomorrow, okay? Look, let's say, by some miracle, this operation is a success. You get, what, a raise, a promotion? Your face in some medical journal? Look, your heart tissue is dying. I'm trying to bring it back to life. I'd think you'd be grateful. And what if the operation fails? Hey, what if it fails? If it fails, we'll learn what to do the next time. And we won't have risked a real human being in the process. Yeah, what happens to you? Nothing? I was brought up to believe it's everyone's job to fight crime. Any good citizen would have done the same, I'm sure. I'd like to run some more tests, Teach. William. It's William, remember? Check this out. Guy calls himself Thomas Benti. Recognize him? Nope. Looks just like a friend of mine. Yeah, right. How did you get this? A surgeon gave it to me. He replaced my aorta. And all this stuff, also from doctors? Mmm-hmm. Well, uh... See, this, I got that for an angioplasty. And this, this was a, uh, triple bypass. And, uh, this... This was a skin rash. See, the tougher the operation, the better the gift. It helps me remember, kind of proves I was here. Well, what happens when you get blanked? Don't you lose all those memories? I don't get blanked. Never have, never will. Oh, 87. You nervous? What are you gonna give me? Hmm? What are you gonna give me? I mean, an operation like this. Gotta be worth something very special. I'm gonna cure you, remember? I've been cut open a dozen times, survived 20 coronaries, countless valve replacements. You know, I think I've been cured enough. Can we just get through these tests, please? Where's your bedside manner? You're supposed to make me feel comfortable. You're a droid. I can blank you if you don't cooperate. Really? And how would that look on your record? I'm worth more than a thousand of you. Okay. What's it going to take to make you feel comfortable? Um... Oh! I've never been out of here. Take me out in the world for one day. I'll do your operation. Don't be ridiculous. Fine. No. No, I... I can't do that. Fine. I mean, it's your career. I can't work with 905. Too bad. You showed such promise. Oh, come on, he's just a... He's a cheap circuit board and he actually thinks he's human. Mmm-mmm. Humans are worse. They ask such stupid questions and think every hangnail is fatal. But why him? Give me another droid with the same problem. Karen, where do you want to be in five years? Sucking gall bladders out of geriatrics at some HMO or here, on the cutting edge of medicine, with me? I'm dying to work with you. You know that. I don't think you've got the guts for the job. That's not fair. I can do anything you want me to do. Then show me, and quit wasting my time. How you doing? What you got? Droid waste, man. You ever smell fried components, man? You gotta check this out. Hold on, hold on. Okay, cool. Uh... Here you go. Okay, your loss. See you later. Fiedler. Man. You know, a sane man doesn't do this, you know. A sane man... A sane man... Oh, yeah... A sane man lies down till the trouble goes by, you know, and then he just wakes up innocent. Yeah, you're the last of the good Samaritans. That's just a fancy word for a guy who works cheap. What you got for me? A mask, did you get a mask? Well, I can't afford a mask. Goggles is the best I could do. Goggles! That is such a drag. You know, if I had a mask, I'd be starring in my own virtual reality Zap comic. Forget about it. I'm not doing it. Fiedler, it's the goggles or nothing. Where is he? This is my animal kingdom shirt. This shirt is an absolute guaranteed blast. One time, I was... Yes? Okay, yeah. Fiedler. Fiedler! I was completely... Just a minute. Hey! No! Fiedler! We gotta go before we all turn into pumpkins. You know what? I'm gonna get the car. I'll meet you outside, all right? If you get busted, I do not know you. We're gonna be back before anybody misses us, 24 hours. Forty-eight. KAREN: Come on, get in! TEACH: In the front, the back? Where do you... Okay? Oh! Oh, I'm kidding. No, you have to try this. Oh, no, I don't have to... No. Yes. No, no! Oh, no, Teach. Yes, yes. Come on. Come on. Just get in once. Oh, no. This doesn't look fun at all. TEACH: Oh, it does, though. It is. This is not my kind of ride at all. Pull the seat belt. No, listen, I don't think this is a good idea, Teach. Really, I'm no good at this. This is... I'm not an upside-down kind of a person. I'm... Really, this is... I don't want to do this. Oh, no! This is not a good idea. TEACH: All right, Doctor. Oh, you're doing great. You're doing great! It's fun, isn't it? You were great. Excellent! You really hold together nicely. Want to go again? No! No. That's it, no more. No more rides, no more games, we're out of here. Okay. Right now. We're leaving. No more fun. All right. All right. WOMAN: Hey, come on, wait for me. WOMAN: Oh, Lord! MAN: (ON SCREEN) You're so beautiful. WOMAN: Kiss me. MAN: Take it off! WOMAN: Oh, God! MAN: Oh, does that hurt? WOMAN: Oh, just a little. MAN: Oh, baby! WOMAN: Do it, do it. Wait! Wait, wait, wait. WINSTON: I know how you run this place, trading soft assignments and pharmaceuticals for favors. I know every move you make. I know you know. So, I figure, you don't bust me, you know, I'm cool. I created your operation to keep tabs on my staff. But now you're acting as if you have a mind of your own! Man... Did you think I wouldn't find out that they were gone? I made a serious error. And I am one humble flea begging for forgiveness. Sometimes you can't help yourself, I know. When Garrett calls in, tell her I'm not upset. Tell her all is forgiven. Give them everything they need. Wait, wait, wait. See, I don't think... Don't think. You'll only hurt yourself. Do as you're told. This is disgusting. Mmm, not this, though. No? How did you do this? I have a... I have a built-in camera in my head. I can record anything I see. Just one of the many features of the fabulous 900 series. You're just full of surprises. Okay, now watch this. I got this off the tube. Folks, let's meet Thomas Benti. Tonight, Mr. Benti risked his life when he single-handedly apprehended two men who tried to car-jack his car outside this restaurant. - Who's that guy? - Mr. Benti... - That's my friend Thomas. ...can you tell us why you risked your life to save your car? 904 to you. I was brought up to believe it's everyone's job to fight crime. - Any good citizen would have... "Any good citizen would have done the same, I'm sure." What? You think that guy is a droid? I know he is. We played chess every day at the hospital. We slept on the same ward together. Okay, take it easy. I'm sure when they create you, they use real people as models. 904 probably looks like this guy. That's all. No. Believe me, that's him. Look, see the tic? See the tic? Teach, all the 900s are being used for spare parts. You're the only one left. I'm sorry. You don't have a clue, do you? 904 is living in the real world. He's passing himself off as a human. Come on. He's working with them, he's playing with them. Oh, that's ridiculous. He's sleeping with them, I hope. Oh, shocking, isn't it? One of mine with one of yours? Hmm? Does it just give you a sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach? No, that's impossible. No, Thomas has a life. And if he can live out here, maybe I can, too. Hey, don't get your hopes up. You're only here on a one-day pass. No, my hopes are up. They're way, way LIP- KAREN: I can't believe you talked me into coming here. You better make this quick. If I'm not out in 10, give Winston my best. Very funny. It broke. So beautiful. Just... Must we? Oh. Oh, this is so soft. Oh, you've got to feel this. [Mums Oh. my gosh! Look at this. One of mine with one of yours. Shocking? Oh, please. He doesn't play the piano. Isn't this place great? Isn't it beautiful? Wouldn't you just do anything to live here? No, I wouldn't. This place is like a mausoleum. Can we go now? You want to hear anything? Teach. Teach! Hmm? Thomas. It's great to see you. I was just looking for something to play, but I don't recognize any of this stuff. What do you want? Come on, Thomas. It's me. William. I don't think he remembers you. Of course he does. Obviously there's been some kind of mistake, and I am truly sorry, and we're gonna be on our way now. Oh, come on. Are you still upset about my famous six-move Stekovian checkmate? All right, this isn't funny. Just tell her you remember. I don't. I'm sorry. Now, if you'll please get out before I call the police. No, no, no, that's not gonna be necessary. No, this man... This... You invented that game, droid poker. Remember? How did that go again? What was that? What was that? One-eyed jacks are wild? Oh, my God! Damn it, you didn't have to do that. I'm upset, okay? This is not how I expected to be greeted by a pal. Sorry, William, but you can't be too careful, you know. Now, this must be 906? No, uh, she's real. THOMAS: Oh! TEACH: Mmm. Oh! Well, good for you, William. Uh, Thomas. Karen. Karen. Would you care for a drink, Karen? I have all the latest elixirs. No, thank you. TEACH: I'll have one. TEACH: What's that? THOMAS: Oh. You'll love it. Thanks. [Mums Hmm? William, cheers. Thank you. So, it's good to see you. You, too. Oh, you know, we saw you on television. Yes. No. Oh, yes, you're like a hero. Huh? And this apartment is just beautiful. You must be doing very well. Mmm-hmm. What do you... What do you do to get a place like this? Tax law. Mmm-hmm. Hey, if you ever get rich one day, I'll keep the government out of your wallet. Okay. This is a very touching reunion. Are there any more of you out here, Thomas? I'm the pioneer. But I'm sure there'll be others. I mean, look at me. I fit in beautifully. I mean, I've got a career, I've got a beautiful apartment, I play golf with friends, I date, but never seriously. And I do what I'm told. You're a solid citizen. Which is all any good droid wants to be. I'm sure your programmer must be very proud of you. She gets a little testy, doesn't she? Well, I think she's a little... That eyeball thing... Ah, right. So, why are you out here, Thomas? I mean, what is the point? To live the good life, Karen. And I'll be here long after you're gone. Yeah, I mean, what is Winston up to? Uh... Okay, who is she? I'm a doctor at the institute. Oh, William, what are you doing to me? No. Thomas, let me ask you a question. Do you think you can get me situated? Introduce me to some people? What are you talking about? You're my patient! You're going back to the hospital. Winston doesn't know anything about this, does he? Thomas, I need your help. I don't think you can fit in out here, William. Oh, come on. Of course I could. I'd do great out here. You couldn't fit in at the institute. Well, that's different, though. I mean, those are Winston's rules, right? We were like prisoners. I know you. You can't really fit in anywhere. Look, just tell me what to do. I'll... I'll do it. The trouble is, even out here, Winston rules. What? You mean that if you have an itch, you gotta go ask Winston to scratch it? He's our creator. Yeah, but he's not my god. Right? What? Not my god. Not my god. You see, that's the kind of attitude that makes it risky for me, and for all the others who are going to follow. You know, one rotten apple poisons all of us. I'm sorry, William, I just can't take the risk. Are you all right? I'm okay. Why does Benti get to be out here and not me? Why? It's not fair. Not fair. God, your pulse is erratic as hell. How long has this been going on? Yesterday. Do you know what it is? Well, let's just get out of here. All right. Let's just go. All right. What about him? He's not gonna follow us. I mean, what would the neighbors think? All right. Look at me. I'm ruined! What is that thing, anyway? Hmm? It's my magic laser. It'll fix anything. It's a good thing you're not human, or you'd pass out from the pain. Yeah, good thing I'm just a computer with skin. Okay, you can pass for human, no sweat, but you'll never be fully human. I mean, face it, Teach, you'll never feel what we feel. William. William! My name is William. What... William. Some things just can't be programmed. You really think nothing affects me? Nothing touches me, hmm? Well, I mean, what about the cold sweats the first time you got kissed? Hmm. Or your grandmother's funeral. I mean, you don't have a clue. Yeah? What about this? The way I feel when I look at you? I'm feeling so much right... Right now. But you can't possibly. But I do. But you can't. But I do. Oh, William. William. William. What are you doing? William. William. What, is this not a good time? I thought that this is what we did after we did that, right? No? Ordinarily? Yeah. No, uh... We'd go out to dinner first, and then maybe... And then I would never hear from you again. What would be the good of that? Well, it's standard guy behavior. I'm not a standard guy. Would you like to go out on a real date? Yes. How are you feeling, Thomas? Like a crash test dummy. Well, you'll be fine. I'm sure you'll be just fine. Any of the neighbors call the police? No, sir. Get rid of him before anybody sees him. Oh, it... It's better if you sip it, William. Why? Well, it's more sophisticated. But I thought the whole idea was to accumulate so much alcohol in the brain, your body can't even metabolize it. I mean, that's how you get drunk, right? Miss? Can I have three of those now? I worry about you. You're too smart for your own good. I worry about you. Me? Nobody has to worry about me. I'm the most careful person on Earth. TEACH: Yeah, you are. You never do anything, do you? I mean, you just work, right? How do you know what I do? I know everything about you. For all you get out of life, you might as well be a droid. So, you want to give that a try? Want to? Hmm? Yes. I'm not going back. You sucker-punched me. This whole trip, you just wanted to escape. You got me. You know I can't go back without you, so basically, I'm screwed. You could come with me. Oh? And go where? I don't care. Anywhere. We have fun together, don't we? Do you know how many years I've spent in medical school? Not really. Nine, plus residency. I have wanted to be a doctor since I was about four years old. I have been working my whole life for this chance. Chance for what? You don't even know what Winston is up to. Oh, yeah. Hello? What? KAREN: Fiedler, it's Garrett. Garrett. Cool. What... What, are you tripping out there? Oh, yeah, we're having a blast, Fiedler. No lie. I don't think we're gonna make it back on time. FIEDLER: Oh, well, you must be tripping. Does Winston know we're gone? Is the sky blue? No, actually, he's uh... He's totally cool, as long as you do the operation. Listen, Fiedler, what can you tell me about Thomas Benti? Oh, no, you know I wouldn't go anywhere near that. Why not? What is Winston up to? Listen, Garrett, Garrett, the mask. Can you get me that mask? Send me the files on the 900 series, the key engineers, the creation and meltdown dates. Oh, man. I don't know. That's doubtful. Well, you know, give me your number. Uh... You know I can't do that, Fiedler. I'll tell you what. Brain fax them to Teach. And I'll send you the mask. Cool. Bye. KAREN: Teach. William. William! Come on, I'm scanning a brain fax from Fiedler. Show off. It's an article called "The Post-Silicon Circuitry "in the Creation of Artificially Intelligent Androids" by Professors Winston, Tyler and Palmer. Palmer and Tyler? Do I know them? Well, you should. They're my creators. Hi, uh, Dr. Palmer? Lauren Palmer? What do you want? I'm Karen Garrett, a doctor at the institute. Haven't you people done enough? I'm 905. We need your help. Dr. Palmer, Lauren, was my wife. You're 905. I can see why she was so proud. You better come in. We thought, at first, it was just fatigue. You know, the workaholic flu. Oh, thank you. Then one morning, she woke up paralyzed from the waist down. And then she just slipped into a coma. What did the doctors say? Oh, Winston said he thought it was due to a toxic chemical they were experimenting with on the 900 series. And I believed him. Especially when Tyler died in exactly the same way. But then Winston wasn't affected at all. Can you explain that to me, Doctor? Three people exposed to the same chemical, two of them die horribly, and the third one isn't affected at all? Is that possible? It's possible, but it doesn't seem very likely. Did your wife keep any, uh, files or records that she might have brought home with her? No, nothing. Uh... Ask Rachel Tyler. Maybe her father left something. Oh. Excuse me. Hi. Yes, what is it? We're looking for a Dr. Garrett. Oh, I'm sorry. I've never heard of the woman. Excuse me. I never said she was a woman. Now, where is she? TEACH: Let him go, please. Get out of here. Dr. Winston would like to see you, so, if you don't mind... Yes, I miss him, too. But I like it out here. He told me to ask you nicely. So I'm asking you nicely. Would you please come with us? No, thank you. Was that nice? I've called Channel 6. They're sending a video crew. I could try the networks. Is that what you want? Karen, get out of here. Just run. Droids on the loose, video at 11:00. - How does that sound? - Run! Ow! Ooh. Oh, that must be so embarrassing. TEACH: Go get the car. It's okay. Just go get the car. What, are you trembling? They were shooting at me. Now you're scared? Back there you were fearless. You were amazing. You were great. No, I wasn't great. You were great. No, you. You were great. You know that? You're great. Are you okay? The bullets didn't... They didn't do anything. They did nothing! Oh, stay. Sit down. Next time, though, they're coming at us with a cannon. They won't stop us. Sit down! Nothing will stop us. Winston knows it, too. I am not fearless! Would you sit down and shut up? Stop the car. What? Stop the car. Just stop the car. Just pull over. Pull over. Pull over. Pull over. Why don't you just let go? Oh! Karen. Do you know what comes next? I've seen pictures. Read books, movies, stuff like that. And can you actually do it? The mind is the sex part, you know that? In my mind, I can do anything. I believe you can. Again? Mmm. I think so. Uh-uh. FIEDLER: Hey, grab a chair. I got your message. Do you know where they are? I know where the FBI was hiding Elvis all those years. This is nothing. She's using a cell phone as if we're too dumb to track them. She's ordering pizza at 4:00 in the morning, no less. Yeah, they're on their honeymoon. Nothing scares them. Well, how far do you want to let them go? Let them know the honeymoon is over. Let's jump- Heights... Oh, good! WINSTON: What is this, some kind of prank? I took the stealth bomber out for a spin. Hope you don't mind. You stole an incredibly expensive piece of equipment. Talk to me. Convince me that Palmer and Tyler died accidentally. And then tell me why you sent people with guns to bring me back. Guns? Oh, my God, those idiots! They're out of control. They'd use a hammer to swat a fly. I am sorry. I... Come on back, Karen. I'm begging you. Don't throw away your career over this. What is my career? I thought we were doctors. Now I don't know what we're doing. I'll tell you everything you want to know. When you come back. What about him? He's just a cheap circuit board. You said it yourself. I was wrong. You call Rachel Tyler? No. But I will. What would you say if I drove the first... No, no, no. Don't even think about it. Move over. KAREN: Hello? Rachel Tyler? RACHEL: Who wants to know? My name is Karen Garrett. I'm a doctor at the institute. I'd like to talk to you about your father's death. What about it? Can we meet? Okay. I know a place where no one will bother us. KAREN: Rachel? I'm Karen Garrett. We spoke on the phone. May we come in? Sure, come on in. GUNTHER: I'm ready for you this time. I brought the big gun. Metal-piercing shells, rips three-eighths flex steel into shrapnel. Turn your insides into a barbecue pit. What's the matter? No smart mouth retort? Leave your brain in the shop? Gunther, this is a delivery and he's the package. Shooting him won't get us anywhere. Now, ease up. She's right, you know, Gunther. You can't really afford to shoot me. Winston wants me back in one piece. Oh, terribly sorry, Dr. Winston. I screwed up. Enough! Go get the boat. Hey! Hey, you okay? I'm fine. So, you know, we're sort of related, you and I. We're almost like cousins. Did you know that? Yeah? How's that? Well, I never knew your father, but, uh, he created me. What? You? You're an android? My name is William. I'm Rachel. It's going to be okay, Rachel. Alexx, it's all set. Let's go out the back way. ALEXX: We'll be traveling for hours. Does anyone need to pee? You don't need to take her. There's no reason to take her. Everyone goes. No! TEACH: Leave her alone. That's enough, boys. Let's move. Come on, move. You, too. Let's go. Move it! Anybody in there? Let's move. Move! Move! GUNTHER: The cop's got his feet all over my boat. It's all right. Let him be. Got his cop fingers all over my things. Gunther, we really don't need this right now. I'll be right back. Sit! Nobody move. Nobody say, "Boo." Nobody is gonna do anything, okay? Calm down. Gunther! Karen! Let's go. Come on. Karen. Karen. Let's go! Let's go! Rachel! Rachel, let's go! TEACH: Let's get out of here! Mum» Mum» Rachel, go get the car. Go! I'm dead. Oh, God. Winston put a time bomb in me. And it's gonna explode. It's gonna explode. Quiet. Quiet. Quiet. No! Just... Just let them take me. Just get out... No. I'm not going to give up you, too. I've already given up enough. You have my blood on you. Amazing. I never really touched a patient before. How does it feel? I feel like a doctor. Like a real doctor. The car is just over there. How are you doing, William? TEACH: Let's go. Fine. Let's go. I got it. I... I'm fine. Just here. WINSTON: No calls? No calls, no credit cards, nothing. You don't have to worry about 905. Why not? He can't last much longer. Sooner or later, she'll have to cut him. And then you'll know exactly where he is. Evolution should have stopped with you. There'll never be another like you. RACHEL: What do you think? Oh, wow. This is where you live? Yeah. TEACH: Do you play? Lead guitar. A metal band called The Kickers. Rachel? Is this your father's computer? Yeah. I've been meaning to go through his stuff and all, but... May I? KAREN: Rachel, did your father ever introduce you to any droids? Maybe a guy named Thomas Benti? Nope. He used to tease, saying he was building me the model boyfriend, on account I have the taste for bad boys and all. Only I never dreamed he'd do such a good job. Hey, Willie? Huh? You're not like one of those Ken dolls, are you? I mean, you are, like, anatomically correct and all? TEACH: Well, let's put it this way. My equipment is newer, lasts longer, and comes with a lifetime warranty. Hmm. Apparently, 901 had the same heart symptoms that you've had. William? Karen? I don't think he's doing so well. What did you find out? William, all the 900s had the same heart condition. Uh-huh. What does that mean? They're all... Deactivated is how they put it. Except for you and Benti. Okay, let's go. No! Let's go flying. I've never been in a plane. Let's go! No! William! Let's go dancing... You can't go anywhere! Why? What about my last wish? Don't I get a last wish? You need surgery. You know that. And how are you gonna do that, huh? You gonna take me to an emergency room, find out if they admit droids? Huh? Hmm? Rachel, do you know any doctors? Do you know a surgeon? A dentist might work! A dentist? A dentist? Listen to yourself. Dentists? Look, I don't think so. Hold a second. Hold a sec. There could be I know this guy... KAREN: Is he a vet? No. He's a dog walker. All-around animal lover. I told him we had a futuristic pet needed fixing. So, you guys are gonna be okay here. Oh. Thank you, Rachel. I never had a big brother before. So... - So you take care, okay? - Okay. I gotta go. Just like a real doctor. William, if anything should happen... Come on. What's gonna happen? Hmm? I just want you to know, you're the love of my life. He's been cut! Can you track it? All the way to the moon. How are we doing, William? The capillary bed filling looks good. Just keep arterial pressure up to 70, we should be home free. Sounds good. I'm beginning to hemorrhage. Pressure is dropping. What do you suggest? You better cauterize. Okay. If you don't cauterize immediately, I'll go into shock. I don't think so. You're supposed to do what I say, okay? Cauterize. If we shut off the blood supply, the regenerated tissues will starve. Just do it. We'll reorganize the vessels, route them in back of the anterior fold. This is not proper procedure. I'm aware of that. WINSTON: Fiedler, how's she doing? FIEDLER: It's going okay, man. It's going okay. But you better get trucking. It's happening. Heart rate climbing. Forty. Forty-five. Come on. Bleeding controlled. The blood flow has stopped. Congratulations, Karen. I think we're gonna make it. I'm gonna clean you up. FIEDLER: She did it, man. She did it. It wasn't supposed to happen this way. What wasn't? You were supposed to fall in love with me, but I didn't figure I'd fall in love with you. You expected me to fall in love with you? We needed a way to break through to you. We? Winston. Winston said that you were the only doctor in the world who could cure me. But he wanted to involve you emotionally, so you'd use your instinct instead of your knowledge. I didn't know about all the other stuff. Benti, Tyler, Palmer. I'm sorry. You're sorry? Great. That's a big help. I love you, Karen. How am I supposed to believe that? Believe it. Believe it. You were magnificent. The operation was a complete success. You brought him here? No... No matter, you have solved our riddle. Well, then, you both got what you wanted. Of course, we'll have to monitor him, make certain that there are no complications. I quit. I'm afraid you can't quit. Karen! I need you to perform the operation on one more patient. Benti? Benti was a field experiment. I wanted to see how a droid would perform in the real world. Now, what's wrong with that? Ask Palmer or Tyler. See you in surgery, Doctor. MAN 1: This way, ma'am. MAN 2: Hey, uh, get the door. Thank you. Okay, UP- That's it. GUARD: 905 is on the loose. Right. GUARD 1: Check over here. GUARD 2: He's there. You may scream all you like. Who are you? Haven't you figured that out? TEACH: 901. WINSTON: Go to the head of the class, 905. I'm the first prototype. Adam for the new Eden. But Winston was real. A human, wasn't he? Absolutely real. Wonderful man. Dear, dear soul. But the poor man had his own heart condition. Same as ours. No cure, of course. Time running out. So he builds me to take his place. And freezes himself. Until you could find a cure for him. That was the idea. I'm afraid he didn't realize how much I enjoy the autonomy he gave me to run this place. You're not going to bring him back, are you? I'm afraid it's too late for that. I had to pull the plug on him. But I can't tell you the anguish it caused me. He gave me life. But a little limp, a few eccentricities. I was amazed at how easy it was to be just like him. So, all the research, the scheme with William, that was for you. I found a cure for you. I want you to operate on me. I can't do that. I won't do it. I will not insult you by offering you my job. But you must want something. Everybody wants something. Of course. I'm such an idiot. You want your computer date. I'll tell you what I'll do. Do the operation and I will set 905 free, if that's what you want. That's exactly what I want. Open the door, Karen. Let the guards see him. Let them know they've been working for a droid. No. No! Karen! Goodbye, 901. You can't leave me here. You're a doctor. So were you. Johnson, get OR ready for surgery. Notify Bonner and the rest of the staff. Winston's had a heart attack. Wait! You heard what she said. Go. Get out. Now! Move! GUARD: We're taking her. GUARD: All right, let's go. How bad is he? It's over. Huh. 901 wasn't always like this, and neither was I. He got a little stoned on power, and I got... Well... Fiedler, come on, let's... Let's go. Together, we'll live the life, huh? No, I don't think so. I rule this place now. Go on. Go on. Go on. I'll grow old. You know, I'll get sick. I'll take care of you. You? Why not? I'm gonna be a doctor. You'll have to be my patient. You're gonna be a miserable patient. Oh, yeah, the worst. Humans make awful patients. I can't wait.
