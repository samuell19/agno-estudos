Would you care to make a contribution to the Lighthouse? Excuse me sir, it's a beautiful day. Would you c-- Hello, it's a lovely day. Would you care to make a contribution to the Lighthouse? Ok, I'll be outside by the taxis. Yeah. Right. I'm Paul. I'm Irena. Yes, I know. Welcome home. How was your flight? Oh, I hate flying. It scares me to death. It scares me, too. - You look really nice. - Thank you! Welcome to New Orleans. Well, I wanted to get here as fast as I could. Mr. AI Curtis, please pick up the white courtesy phone. We can get a taxi down there. Did you wait long? No, no. Just a few minutes. Ohhh, you are here at last. I'm so glad. Oh, let me look at you. Let me look at you. Oh, your hair is so pretty! Is that how they're doing the hair now? - Femolly, this is my sister Irena. - I can see that. I'd know the Gallier eyes anywhere. Oh, Paul, she's a lovely, lovely little thing. Your brother is driving me crazy waiting for you. Do I get the credit for that? Femolly keeps me out of trouble. And that's a full-time job, honey. You'd better believe it. - Fem... - Femolly, Femolly. Like female. F-e-m-a-l-e. See, I was orphaned, too. You-You like this house? So they didn't know what name to put on the birth certificate, so they just put 'child female'. But the woman that raised me, God rest her soul, she didn't read English too good so she pronounced it, 'Femolly'. Uh, so here I am. Female. Femolly. Femolly. ♪ Faraway places... ♪ Fate wrenched us apart as children. Thy mercy restored us here today for this mending. - We thank thee, Lord. Amen. - Amen. - Mmm! - Watch out. This is hot. Oh, I forgot to call the Robinsons. I'm sorry. Well, why do you have to call them now? They care about me. Sit down, sit down, sit down. You can call after dinner. This is Femolly's special gumbo. Special gumbo tonight: Yesterday's chicken. That's right, that's right. I just didn't want them to worry about me. They've been very nice. You'd like them. Janice works at the nursery school. At least, part time. She has three children. And Arnold is from the CPA, you know? He's extremely mellow. The only time he loses his temper is about April 15th and then he... Did they ever tell you how our parents died? Yes. What did they tell you about me? Well, uh, not much. I knew I had a brother, but I was only four. I used to fantasize about you... when I was in the orphanage. Fantasize? Well, you know... about you coming to rescue me and things. Daydreams. Yes, I had the same dreams. I've got a surprise for you. Do you remember when we used to practice together? Practice? For what? For the circus. Uh-uh, I said it was a surprise. Now, no peeking, huh? No peeking. Ta-dah! Oh, god. All the skeletons are out of the closet now, huh? When Grandfather started the circus, he only had one wagon. It was a beautiful two-tiered one. There's a picture of it somewhere... Some... Oh, there they are. See? The apes were on top and the cats underneath. Heh, the chimp used to tease the cat by throwing its garbage down through the bars. Oh, they look so young. Mother looks so happy. I envy you. Wish I'd known them. Some little mice sat in the barn to spin... Pussy came by and popped her head in. What are you doing, my little men? Weaving coats for gentlemen! Very good! Shall I come in and cut your threads off? Oh, no, kind sir, we will snap our heads off. What took you so long? He's been waiting' forty-five minutes. Fuck off! I had to get a babysitter. Room three. Hurry up. Here, give it to me. I'll take care of it. Babysitter. You're always late. Sorry I'm late. Hi, I'm Ruthie. But you can call me anything you want if the price is right. A joke. it doesn't cost anything extra to laugh. Oh, I get it. Strong silent type, huh? Uh, you know the rules around here? Guess not. Okay... A massage alone is twenty-five dollars, and for twenty-five dollars that's all you get. Tipping is allowed and appreciated, you know, if you wanna negotiate for, uh something extra. Now, we take Mastercharge, Visa, American Express but not for tips. Ok, that's not really true. You can put tips on Visa, if you want. Ew! Help! Somebody help me! Dr. Yates, New Orleans zoo. Bill Searle called, said something about a stray cat? What took you so long? Go on inside. - In here? - Right there. Oliver, you aren't gonna believe this. What it is, see, it's a, uh, it's a goddamn black leopard is what it is. And don't ask me where it came from, 'cause we don't know. I guess it, uh, mauled a hooker last night. Now, she's all right. We've got it trapped in a room upstairs here. Look at this. - Candid camera. - Let's hear it for voyerism. - Strictly security. - Sure. Where'd he go? Back under the bed. Must have scared the shit out of the john who was here last night. Guy split stark naked. This neighborhood, who'd notice. How'd he get in there, anyway? Fire escape? There's no fire escape, and the window's got bars on it. - Back door? - Locked. Well, he must have come in the front. I think I would have noticed. Wait... Look. Look there. Holy shit! He's enormous. Hundred twenty-five, hundred-thirty pounds. More like a hundred and fifty. He's big all right. Real big. All right. Let's go. Ketamine, straight, two thousand milligrams. Let's knock him down quick and get him in the squeeze cage. Yeah. Okay. Can you get to that window from the outside? Sure. All right, let's go. Oh, Bill? Bill? If, uh, we could borrow a couple of walkie talkies, I could assist from the monitor. Can I borrow it? Thanks. I shot the coyote in Baton Rouge, remember? - Two thousand milligrams? - Yup. - You got one ready in case I miss? - Uh-huh. - Full CO2 cartridge? - Yeah. You got room for this? I'll make room. I'll hold the ladder. Hold the ladder. Be careless. You too. Oliver, he knows you're there. I hear him. He doesn't sound overjoyed. You're scaring him. What are you doing? Cleaning the window. What? Cleaning the- Jesus Christ, he's goin'... through the goddamn window. Paul! Paul? - How is he? - He's ok. Come on. ...for only half an hour. If only I had let you set that clock, Benny, we might have a clue. You didn't set the... alarm, did ya? - Good morning. - Good morning. Where's Paul? Oh, they needed him at the mission, bright and early. Oh... He was going to show me the sights. Get yourself a guide book. They sell them all over town. Go to the French Quarter, you'll have a good time, and don't worry about him. Now, sit down. Would you like some coffee? I want to see if you like it. It's chicory. And then I'll steam you some milk. You want some breakfast? - Uh, no, thank you. - Oh, that's all right. I'll fix you some breakfast, don't worry. - Yes, can I help you? - I am looking for Paul Gallier. I don't believe he's in today. Oh. I'm his sister. Oh. Well, I can take you to his office, if you'd like to wait. Um, no, thank you. Thank you. ♪ We're out where Bret Ti Yo is ♪ ♪ All your feelings, yes ♪ ♪ Oh, and I tremble, I tremble, I tremble ♪ ♪ A friend of mine ♪ - What's that over there? - That's the zoo. Oh, wait, wait, I wanna go there. What for? It's nothin' but a dump. You wanna go to a zoo, why dontcha go to the Bronx? Why don't you let me take you to the French Quarter? I've seen the French Quarter, now, please, stop! It's your money. Keep the change. All right, children, stay in line. He's not so dangerous in a cage. When we get finished testing, we're gonna hafta free up some of these other exhibits so that we can give this new leopard some space. You're gonna have to disarm him. What does that involve? Not much. Cut its claws, root canals. Uh, file and crown its fangs. There's a dentist in town that does the work. Uh, Radenauer. Tom Radenauer? Yeah, he does people too. Yeah, I know, he's my dentist. Shit, Oliver, we don't have the funds for this. Well, you notice how it's been coming down lately. Aren't there any other alternatives? Not really. Because of its history it's no good for breeding. We could try trading it to another zoo. I'm afraid, uh, because of its erratic behavior they just wouldn't take it. You could euthanize it. What's that? Kill it? - Yep. - It's not an acceptable solution. - How much would that cost? I said it's not acceptable. Can we at least discuss it? Look, I'll put up with being under-budgeted and under-staffed and the fact that these exhibits were built in 1901 and they're falling apart, but I will not put up with that crap. Fine. Calm down. I only asked. Looks like we have a gourmet leopard on our hands. He threw up in the cage. Joe found pizza in the vomit and-- Yeah, sure did. - Pepperoni. - Leopards eat pizza? Oh, they're scavengers. He probably raided a garbage can before he went to the massage parlor. Doesn't look like he went there out of hunger. Maybe he was horny. There's always the possibility. Anything else? Nothing, no worms, no distemper, no encephalitis. Whoever owns him takes good care of him. Sure does. He's a superb cat. A superb cat? He's a menace. Not dreaming, noble lady, which it is that I am taken with strange semblances seeing ...thy face which is so fair to see... or else compassion would not suffer thee... to grieve my heart in such harsh... or else compassion would not suffer me to grieve my heart with such harsh... Hey! Hey, wait a minute! Alright, you wanna come on down from there? Come on, I'm not gonna hurt you! Watch out. How'd you get up there? Here, lemme help you. What the hell were you doin' back there? - Sketching. - Sketching? That animal's not even supposed to be out. Why'd you run away like that? Well, you scared me. - But the leopard doesn't? - You can sense how an animal feels. Oh, you can? Yeah, sometimes we're all connected. Who are you? Irena Gallier. Who are you? I'm the curator here. The zoo's been closed for an hour and a half. What's wrong? Nothing. I... I feel dizzy. Jesus, you're burning up. Come on, I'll get you something. - Oh, no, I'm fine. - Come on, come on, come on. I don't bite. Here, take these. Oh, I don't believe in medicine. It's aspirin. No, thank you. I'm exhausted, that's all. I flew in the day before yesterday, went sightseeing, forgot to eat, and when you started chasing me, I just got overexcited. Yeah, well, uh, I do sometimes have that effect on women. Oh, really? No. That was a joke. Yeah, well, I don't wanna keep this on any more. It's wetting up my hair, thank you. It'll reduce the temperature. No, it's down already. Feel. Well, just because it's cooler to the touch doesn't mean the temperature's gone. I'll go get a thermometer. Oh, please. I've always had a weird metabolism. Really. I just need some food and I'm all right. How about you? You wanna have some dinner with me? Yeah, sure, great. If you feel up to it. I feel hungry. Well, I know a reasonably good steak place. Oh, I don't eat meat. You don't look like a curator. I look exactly like a curator. No, you don't. Well, you haven't met many curators. I guess not. What does a curator do? Different things. Buys animals, sells animals, veterinary work, research, arranges the exhibits... Maybe gets an expedition, if he lucks out on a donation or grant. Expedition? Like into the jungle? Mostly it's the bureaucratic jungle. We purchase most of our exhibits from animal dealers. How long have you worked at the zoo? Ten years... No, eleven years now. Well, I've been into zoology ever since I was a kid. I prefer animals to people. - What about you? - Oh, I'm looking for a job. My brother Paul's supposed to help me. If he ever gets back. He's been gone for two days now. Oh, how do you eat these? Well, you take this little wedge of lemon like this... And squirt it on your oyster. Then you hit it with some of this horseradish and red sauce. Just a touch, pick it up, and... Let that sucker slide down your throat. What kind of job are you looking for? Well, commercial art... mainly. I've, uh, taken art lessons. And then you chase it down real quick with a swig of beer. Or Coca-Cola. Look, uh, how would you like to work at the zoo? The zoo... That would be fascinating, but... No, I, I'm not really qualified. Are you qualified to work in the gift shop? They need help in there. If you're interested, I can pull a few strings. - You could? - Sure. I'll talk to the curator. I'll be right back. Right in the pool, girls! Jean, let's go in the pool. Come on, girls, into the pool. Let's go! Up, up, c'mon, c'mon... Bath time! Good morning! - Morning. - Alice. I put the new tape in here, you wanna give a listen? Yeah. It sounds terrific. Ol' Tom's about due for a worming. Want me to handle that? Yeah. Hey, Tom. Why are you so dressed up today? - I have a meeting. - Oh, but where? In my office. Hi, Angel. Hi, Angel. Uh, the cheetah's been a bit of a problem. Been acting really weird. I don't know quite what to do. - Diet? - Yep. Light day, fast day, five days regular. Vary it but keep it balanced. Some muscle meat, viscera. A few bones now and then, plus the vitamin supplements oughta straighten them out. - Ok, I'll try. - Oh, how's the black leopard? Fine. A little extra protein never hurts. Joe? - Oh, little rats-a-roni. - Yep Rat-atouille? Rat-tartar? Like I said, the pay ain't great. No, I, I really like it. I like to be around the animals. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah. Ali the Alligator, Bambi and Oscar the Orangutan. Every now and then you gotta feed these guys a pillow. - Y'know? - What? Nothing. Aquila. Just plain horsemeat. Pardon me, you don't have to kill it. Hey, Mr. Fabulous. Here, try a hunk to God! Eat, dammit. God, I feel so helpless! I know, I know, Drew. Let it out. Let it all out. You don't know what it was like, Sarah. Coming into the house, and finding her lying on the floor through all that smoke. I'm sorry. I told myself I was gonna stop crying on your shoulder after that trial thing, I'm sorry. It's just that if I'd stopped on the way home from work for a beer, she- But you didn't! And that's what you've got to remember. Oh, Pancho! What happened? Did they operate? Here. Come on, Brett, let's go. We're gonna be late! Hurry up! What's wrong with that dame, anyway? I thought you guys are supposed to be courteous. You've got to hurt it or it won't respond. Whatcha got? Empire Strikes Back gum, twenty-five. Quarter. Thank you. - Hi. I'm Alice. - Oh, Irena. - You're Oliver's friend. - Yeah, well... We just met a few days ago, actually. You're not from New Orleans. No. Strange, isn't it? People are crazy here. I think it's the humidity. So have you seen much of the city? No. I'd like to, though. Well, why don't we have a drink after work? I can help you work out a little itinerary. - Okay. - Okay. Fine. Ciao. Just hit it real hard! There you go. That color really looks good on you. Where'd you get that outfit? Excuse me. Where the hell did she come from? Jesus. Don't encourage these assholes, please. I did not encourage them! I tell 'em I'm gay. - What if they believe you? - I should be so lucky. If you wanna get laid, you can do a lot better than that, believe me. I was just being friendly. I was not trying to get laid. - Occasionally they're compatible. - I wouldn't know. How come? I- I just never met anybody I liked enough... to have sex with. Never? Not so far, no. Really? You're still a virgin? Oh, don't make it sound so perverse. No, no, not at all, it's just... incomprehensible maybe Especially these days. Oh, you must have come close once or twice. - Yeah. Once or twice. - How close? Come on. The first parents I lived with... The mother was ok, but - the father was kind of... - A lech? Yeah, he always used to grab me when I went by him. Overhand or underhand? I know the type. - And there was this one boy... - Mi hermana. What? Mi hermana. Friend of yours? No, I... I never saw her before. What did she say? Mi hermana. My sister. She's probably drunk. So, what happened? Uh, what? I don't remember what I... The boy you liked. Oh, right. So, uh, you know, we petted and stuff like that. He wanted to go all the way and so did I, but... I don't know. I got scared. He looked so... What? - Huge. - God. What's his name? Quick. Oh, I guess I'm a romantic. When it's right, it'll happen. It'll be magical. No, I'm not knocking it. Well, here's to the magic. Well, it's the same with every bureaucracy. You think everything's worked out with these people and then they won't... ...meet you halfway. I don't know what to tell you. ♪ What's new, pussycat? Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho ♪ ♪ What's new pussycat? Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho ♪ ♪ Pussycat, pussycat, I love you. ♪ ♪ Yes, I do. ♪ ♪ You and your pussycats smell. ♪ Come on, fella, I gotta clean out the bunkers. Clean it out, it'll be real nice for you.

Come on! Back up. Would you back up please? Go to the back! - Hey, Oliver? - Yeah? Bring the prod, he's goin' ape. Simmer down! Hey, come on! Oliver! Call the paramedics! Call 'em! You shouldn't be doing this. He was only twenty-six years old. We better tell the police the leopard's gone. Femolly? Femolly? - Paul! Paul, where were you? - In prison. Prison? What for? I was praying for the condemned. Oh, Paul. Paul. Forgive me. I saw somebody killed today. Somebody I knew! I didn't think you were ready, but you are. I knew when I saw you with him. Who? Oliver? You want to fuck him, don't you? You dream about fucking him. Your whole body burns. It burns all along your nerves and your mouth, your breasts! You go wet between your legs. Stop it! Every time it happens, you tell yourself it's love... but it isn't. It's blood. Death... You can't escape the nightmare without me. And I can't escape without you. I've waited a long time for you. Paul, don't you touch me! But I'm the only one who can touch you, and you're the only one who can touch me. Don't you see, we're safe together, because we're the same. I am not like you! Oh, yes you are. You've always known it. Do you remember when you were a child, the animals used to call your name? And you knew in the dark when the others were dreaming, you could never get to sleep. You're insane. No. No, I'm not. I'm not in love. What will you do? Will you leap through his hoop? Take his head in your mouth like an egg? I need you. Who are you? I need you! I need you! I need you! Don't! You're not my brother! No! Don't! Stop! What's wrong? Can I help you? Are you sure everything's all right? Honest, really. I, I thought someone was chasing me. It must have just been somebody off the... I'm... I'm sorry I got so excited. I just got scared. Alright. I'd be glad to write it up. No! No, no, thank you. Everything all right, Bill? Yeah. Turned out to be nothin'. Good. Quiet! Shut up! Idiot! What's wrong? I don't know. Something strange. He senses something. You better look into it. Let me call it in. I was sleeping. I didn't hear anything! Are you sure? Hm? What about the basement? I suppose you don't know anything about the basement either, hm? Basement... Oh, I don't go there. What do we hear from the guys at the lab? They're on their way. Miss Perrin? Doctor Yates? - You're with the zoo, right? - Yeah. Come with me. I wanna show you something. At least we know now where the leopard came from. Follow me. - What's that smell? - I don't know. Yeah, the dog picked up the scent real strong. You shoulda seen him. He went crazy. Take a look. There's pieces of three or four bodies in there. - Probably more buried around. - Oh, god. I expect Gallier killed them first... Possibly as part of some ritual. Then fed 'em to the leopard. We found others too, over the years. Mostly prostitutes, female runaways, half-eaten, genitals torn out. But why? Listen, who knows? Gallier's been in and out of psycho wards since he was twelve. He's a religious fanatic. Where could he possibly have found a cat like this? And how could he have handled it by himself? He was raised around them... At least until he was ten. His folks were carnival people. Lion trainers. Till they blew their brains out one night. And what about... Irena? Is she involved? What are you suggesting? Irena hadn't even met her brother until a week ago. We have no reason to suspect her. In fact, it looked as if he planned to kill her, too. And if I was her, I'd find another place to live. I'll take care of that. - Don't touch me. - Watch it, lady. Ok, take her in. It's an old MG. Bought it two years ago and been fixing it ever since. The room's upstairs, if you're tired and wanna lie down. I've been using this room as a dark room so it might be a little cluttered. I'm gonna grab a few hours' sleep. I thought we might be goin' out to the country. First thing in the morning. If you need anything, I'll be right across the way. He couldn't be my brother. My brother wouldn't have done those things. No, I'm sure he wouldn't. Well... Good night. Look at that boat, hm? Look at that crane. Look at that boat! This is it. Bayou Plantation. One of these days I'm gonna buy you a plantation. Let's get the boat. It's that, or we have to swim. - Open that? - Pardon me? This knot here? Hey, Oliver. Hey, Yeatman. I opened her up and aired her out. Yeatman, you old shoe picking' fish bait you, how the hell are ya? And you, redneck? Hey, Yeatman, this is Irena. Irena, this is Yeatman Brewer. Oh, she's mighty pretty. Here, let me help you with your bags. Sure. Yeatman helped me build this place. He also helped me tear it apart a few nights ago. You draw this in real slow and I think there's a crab on here, okay? Then I draw him across... Don't lift the net up! Don't lift the net up. You got 'em. You got two of 'em! All right. Not bad. Now you take them, and you dump 'em in that basket. Not... on me! Billie, me and Ted are going back to the hotel and take a nap before dinner, ok? Okay, honey. Don't do anything I wouldn't do. Is there anything you wouldn't do, Billie? Oh, it's so dreary. Hold it right there. I'm sorry, were you talkin' to me? - May I take your picture? - I'd love it. - Say cheese. - Cheese. Listen. What? Don't you hear it? Yeah, that's alligators. They're gonna eat us. - Alligators. - Yeah. There's only one way to keep 'em away. You know what it is? You have to make love. They hate the sound. I can't. Look, don't be upset, baby. It happens. I like you, but... Well, that's no problem, hon. I like you too. You don't understand. Oh, sure I do. You're just a little nervous, that's all. I know how to take care of men like you. You just need some time. Every time I pray it won't happen again. Yeah. Hm. You've got very... very beautiful hair. Thank you. Oh, relax, it's no big deal. Momma'll make it better. Oh, that's good. That's much, much better. Don't look at me! Detective? - Looks like we got us another murder. - The leopard? Yeah. The girl came back late last night with a man. Early thirties, brown hair. Our people put the actual time of the death at around three. Who was she? Who knows? A tourist, maybe. Huh, now get this. He picked her up at a cemetery. Can we look? Hope you haven't had breakfast. Come on. Where you goin'? Hey! Where you goin'? I'm leaving. I have to! What? Wait! Where you goin'? Somewhere! I can't stay here any more. Why? Why? Why? Why? Just say why! Why? Can't you see I'm going crazy, just like him? Who? Paul? Paul? He has nothing to do with you. I don't even think he's your brother. Listen, Irena. I'm thirty-four years old. I spent most of my life looking' for somebody I even wanted to be in love with. Now that I found you, I'm not gonna let you go. - I love you. - Oh, yeah? Would you love me just as much, if, if we could never sleep together? - Don't be stupid. - Yes? I love you and I wanna take care of you and that's all that's important. I'm afraid. I'm afraid. Of what? I'm afraid for you. Irena, you don't understand. I'll always love you. I loved you before you were born. The leopard's probably out of the parish by now unless he's dead. I'll believe it when I see it. I don't think you're gonna see it. What do you mean? Well, I've been talking to the Sheriff's department, they're gonna call it off. We can't afford the manpower or the time. It's been over a week now. What, are you out of your mind? Look, they set their traps, they did everything they could. What do you want? Is that what you're gonna say the next time it kills somebody? Hey, don't give me that shit, Oliver. You're the one who wouldn't shoot the bastard when we had him in a cage. Look man, I'm sorry, okay? I don't know why I did that, sorry. Yeah, well, fuck you. He's right. - No, he's not. - Yeah, well how the hell would you know? What? - What? - Nothin'. How's Irena feeling? Fine. You wanna talk about it? Talk about what? Jesus, what do you think? - Irena's gonna be all right. - I don't even ca- Irena's not the one I'm worried about. Her type'll always be all right. - Her type? What the hell does that mean? - Look, I'm not blind, Oliver. I've seen you obsessed before, but not like this. I even thought I'd seen you in love before. I... I guess that was just my vanity. - Let's talk about something else, alright? - Okay. All right. I know what I'm doin'. Save me. Only you can stop this killing. You've got to make love with me... As brother and sister. I've searched for you for so long... From one foster home to another. We can live together as mates. Just as our parents did. You do know that they were brother and sister, don't you? - No. - Oh, yes. Make love with me... And save us both. No. I'm not like you. Well, that's the lie that will kill your lover. But at least let me spare you that horror. Come on, come on. Come and lie next to me. No! Oliver doesn't love you. He loves the panther. He wants you because he fears you. Let Alice have him. She thinks his fear is courage. and he thinks his fear is love. Well, they were made for each other. So were we. Take my hand. No. Then you leave me with no choice. Oh, Paul. I'll come with you, ok? We'll go together, you and I, ok? It'll be alright. I'm gonna make some coffee. Sure. I'll get some towels. Irena, I'm back. Alice is here. We're gonna fix a pot of coffee. Why don't you join us? Irena. Oliver! Alice! Oliver! Alice! Get the gun, get the shotgun! Paul... is dead? Then you have no one. Who am I? - What am I? - Shhh. Don't ask what you already know. Know... Femolly, I don't know. What... I don't know where to go. Live as he did. Hidden... in jails. Never loved. Pretend the world is what men think it is. Wait! Don't leave me like this. I don't know where to go. It doesn't matter where you go... Does it? Where to? How far will that take me? Where do you wanna go? North. Richmond. Richmond. Long ago, our ancestors sacrificed their children to the leopards. The souls of the children grew inside the leopards until they became human. We were gods then. We are an incestuous race. We can only make love with our own. Otherwise we transform and before we can become human again, We must kill. Welcome home. Irena. Mother. You must return. Hi, Sandy. - Hi, Alice. You're late. We're closing. - Oh, just a quick dip. Please. I really need it tonight. - Okay, five minutes. - Yes. Thanks. Hey, has it been five minutes yet? Hey, Sandy? What's wrong, Alice? Why are you following me? - Following you? - Don't deny it! - Hey, what's going on? - I know you wanna kill me! Kill you? I was looking for Oliver. I tried the hospital but he was already out. I'm sorry if I frightened you. - Hey, what's going on? - Nothing. Oh, god. - Hello? - Oliver. Yeah? Are you all right? I called before. Yeah. Oliver, Irena followed me tonight.

The crows are plucking the quills out of the porcupines and I don't know what to do. Separate them? - Oh. - Brilliant. - Got it? - Yeah. - Thanks. - Sure.
