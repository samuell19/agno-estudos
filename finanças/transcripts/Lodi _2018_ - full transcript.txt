And where did you get the money? 'Sweet dreams', bro. Huh? Here. What is this? It's called 'sweet dreams'. It makes you fall into a deep sleep. That can even make a horse fall asleep with just one drop. That is how I get money these days. This is a secret. I use that to make my customers fall asleep. With just one drop, they are sure going offline. That's when I grab their jewellery, and the contents of their wallets. What? Tiger, you idiot! What if they wake up? This will not let you down. They will wake up the next day for sure. Franco Padiernos! Coffee? No, thanks. 18D called. He says his sink is clogged. 18D? Yeah. You go with me, so you will know what to do. I'm fine on my own.

He wants to watch us getting it on first. Then he will join us. Are you okay with that? That's fine. As long as you don't add any shady business. I know you, tiger. I don't want to get involved with your criminal activities. This is clean. I would not do anything to put my best friend in danger. Just saying. So... How is the new job? It's okay. Although I don't earn that much. Then it is fine you can cash extra tonight. I heard he is very generous. Is that so? Young. Fresh and beefy. Hard. Delicious lips. Sweet. Do you want to taste him? Of course. Come. So good-looking. Go for it. Delicious. Smells great. Does he taste good? Ehhhh. Do you want a show? What show? Show. I suck him while he sucks me. And you... You just watch.

He is already asleep. Hey... wake up! What if he wakes up? No problem. You are a good boxer, aren't you? If he wakes up, just hit him. So he will get a double knock out. We are here anyway. Start going through his bag. You are nothing but trouble, Tiger. Hello my dear friends of Showbiz Radio! The mega chatterbox is back. It is Clara Molino...! These are scary dangerous times! Here an example what happened to a friend of ours just last night. You know who I'm talking about? I am referring to an award-winning fashion designer. And a respected talent manager. It is no less than Mr. Resty Mata. According to what I heard, the following happened. It's said that our friends invited two rent boys to his home. So they started drinking alcohol. They got drunk of course. He did not realize that his drink was spiked. Yes... He was given something to make him drop into a deep sleep. And while he was knocked out. The guys stole his money, his jewellery and a lot more. That's what those lowlifes did. So that's it! Our friend's evening ended in a disaster. At least he was not hurt. He was not killed. That would have been crazy! It would be such a tragedy if something like that happened. Right away, he reported the incident to the police. And now they are hunting for those two guys. Those rent boys are too much. No way I will book them. Don't worry. Don't worry. We will update you right away, regarding the developments of this case. Don't get mad, my friends. We will do something about this. Okay. Now the moral of the story is for us to be careful with the strangers we bring into our homes. You can't let him into your house so easily, just because he is handsome. So unsafe. Don't you agree my friends? Take not of that. That just can't be. Did you hear about what happened to Christian? He is that teenage call-boy. We sometimes see him while he is hunting for clients in Avenida. The police had their fun with him. He was beaten up in the precinct. But it did not end there. Afterwards... The three policemen played with his butt. He had penises and batons right inside his hole. His asshole must be super loose by now. He won't need to push hard when going to the toilet. Tiger... Aren't you afraid of getting caught? Getting caught? Don't worry. That faggot can't find us. Huh? What's happening to you? Just relax. Where do you get your 'sweet dreams' from? I have a supplier. Why? You have something up in the sleeve? Just don't ask. Okay? There. I sent you the number. Thanks. Here you go, my friends! Here is the latest on the case of the famous designer and talent manager, Resty Mata. Here is the news. One of the rent boys who drugged and robbed him has finally been apprehended. The suspect has been identified and his name is Tiger Umali. He finds his victims through 'Hornet' and 'Grindr'. What are those? I don't visit them. There are still no leads to the other guy with Tiger. The suspect does not want to sing. Hey! I know you are a singer. Don't deny that! Seems he is loyal to his friend. It is still scary my friends. The other guy is still on the loose. My friends, be careful. Don't just bring home any stranger. Don't say I did not warn you. Franco. The boss is looking for you. He needs you to fix something. Okay. I'll see him right now. It seems you are lacking sleep. Are you okay? I'm fine. I just stayed up late for something important. I'm on my way. Who are you? Why are you late? I'm sorry. I had a big headache when I woke up this morning. Too bad you did not see the police here. Huh? Someone broke into Barcelon's unit. And then? Actually, nothing was stolen. But pretty boy got knocked unconscious. His face got bruised. The police suspect that it is a crazy fan. But they believe it is a dude. It was quite a strong punch. What? You spaced out again. The doorman has been calling. There seems to be a problem in our lobby. Okay. I'm on it. Ooooh my friends! I am scared! I am really scared! This is too much to handle. What has the world come to? I'm sure, you have already heard the news. Someone broke into the condo of everybody's crush, Brent Barcelon. It's just last week, we were chatting with him here in the studio. Remember? Hey Brent. Be very careful! I know that there are so many going crazy over you. There are so many dangerous people in the world today. This drives me nuts! Crazy. This is super crazy! Here is a flash report by Molina Girl. The leading man of 'Forbidden Desire', and endorser of 'Idol for Men', Brent Barcelon was rushed into hospital. This is crazy! This morning, he was found unresponsive by his rumoured girlfriend, Camille de Vera. The gossip is going around that the cause is drug overdose. A lot of people can't believe the actor is using illegal drugs. Because he is very conscious of his health. The police is currently investigating the matter. And there is more. According to the latest unconfirmed report. When Brent was found... There were drops of blood on his sheets. And according to the rumour, the blood derived from his ass. Now here are our questions. Is there foul play in this incident? And if there is foul play. Does this have anything to do with the break in of Brent's condo just recently? And is there the possibility that Brent was raped, while he was unconscious? I can't handle this. This is too much for me. There are so many questions that needed to be answered. His loved ones are waiting for answers. Especially the fans. Brent's manager, the designer Resty Mata, is inconsolable. He was in tears on telling us his protegee is in critical condition. At the moment, he is being monitored at the intensive care unit of Capitol Medical Center. Get well soon my love. You can make it through this. There are many of us waiting for your recovery. Don't worry! We will continue to update you regarding this case. This is so crazy!
