Brent, honey! Are you up? Come on dear. Jeepers! I could use a little help here. Honey, I'm sure Brent will be right down. Is there anything I can do to help? Oh, careful hun, I just did my hair. Hi! Hi, Larry. You excited about the trip? Sure am, sir. Here, I brought your mail up for you. Thanks. Where's Brent? Oh, he's up in his room. He'll be down in a while. I think he's still packing. Oh, hi, Larry. Hi, Mrs Benziger. I hope you remembered your long johns. Sure did. I'ma go run up and see if I can give Brent a hand. Would you mind sir? Oh, shit, Larry are you okay? You sick little pig. Just keep praying. I hope I'm not interrupting anything here? Cute, real cute. You know, I was delighted to hear that the Benzigers were gonna drag you along. Pink is definitely your color. You know you really are demented Larry. Brent-O. Do the words knock before entering mean anything to you? What are you doing, your folks said you'd be packing. This is important, close the door. Hey you finally goin' up to Wilson Creek, yeah? I gotta tell you I'm jealous, but now with Julie Junior gone, ain't much sense in us going back. Hey. What about yours, looking forward to it, huh? I guess it really doesn't matter, does it? We can't let 'em rule our lives now, you know? I guess they'll just have to learn to live with it. Why are we watching this babbling idiot? - I'm outta here. Post season rush, you know. It's not him we're watching. I said you enjoy have a good time, you're lucky. See yah. Check out the bedroom. So, it's a mess. What else is new? Not mine asshole, hers, Mrs. Gleason's. What's he doing back? That's weird. The mail already came. Here, got you something, grabbed your report card. You don't get it. Cynthia Gleason is fucking the mailman. Are you shitting me, how do you know? Because they do it everyday. Rain, sleet or snow. Holy! Wow, what a babe. She does this everyday?

Well, I don't know. We've got kind of a full load already. It's kind of cold out to be hitchhiking. Well, yes it is, but who knows what kind of clown might be out there. Joke's on you. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Brent, watch your language. Dad, did you see that? You heard your mother. Who's that dad, you know him? Who's what son? Oh, the guy in the truck? No, never met him before. That's just country folks for you. I wonder if the young guys are as friendly as the old ones. I'm sure you'll be the first to know. Hey, I got a good idea, let's do a sing-along. What do you think honey? - Yeah. Hey, come on kids, do you know "100 Bottles Of Beer On The Wall"? Well, Brent you could play along on your guitar. Oh, honey that's a good idea. Come on Brent, please honey. Guitar is electric. He's kidding mom. Oh, this would be a lot of fun, come on kids. We'll start. - All right. ♪ 100 bottles of beer on the wall ♪ ♪ 100 bottles of beer ♪ ♪ If one of the bottles should happen to fall ♪ Get a load of those two. Tell me that opposites don't attract. This is unbelievable. Right out here in the open and this guy is trying to cop a view. That never stopped you. Why do you have to be such an ass, Brent? Oh, she's really pissed off. Damn right I am. I think he means her. Oh, God. Brent, what's he doing? Shit, dad, you better stop the car. Dad? I feel as if we're expected. Oh, isn't this cute? This has got to be the most beautiful place in the whole world. I just feel so happy right now. Mom. Do you know how lucky we are to live in a country like this? I mean we are so lucky. We drive into my- Settle down. And then when you do this. People are watching. People are watching, blow your nose. Honey, lets go get something to eat now. Larry! I'll have two fried eggs and some ham. Come on Ed, you know you already had your cholesterol for this week. You're acting like a child again. Hey, this place is pretty authentic. Hi. Hello. - Anywhere you'd like dear. - Thank you. It really smells good here. Honey, how's my hair look? Stunning, dear. What can I get for you today? How about some coffee to start? Sounds great. I'll have some coffee. Coffee, come on now. How about I get you children some nice hot chocolate? Isn't that sweet, thank you. Oh, I forgot. I've gotta make a phone call. I gotta call the office. Do you have a pay phone here? Just the one across the parking lot. Honey, I'll be right back. Just give me a second. This smells so good my nose is getting erect. For Christ's sakes don't blow it. Here we are. I'm terribly sorry, here let's get you to the ladies room, clean that up before it stains. I'm fine, really. Well, well, well, fancy meeting you here. So who's hungry? I think I'll pass. Be careful not to flood it Mr. Benziger. Son, I was taking these things apart before you could walk. I wonder who put them back together. Be a good dog, Blue, you get in the back now. Oh, look honey, maybe he can help us. Hey. Hey, just who you think you are huh? Oh, so this is it? There, how do you like it? Only mine's an '88. Sick him Blue, bite him boy. Sick him Blue, bite him boy. Okay, that'll be enough. That's enough, Blue. - Why don't you go inside and get some more coffee. Stay, Blue. I'm sorry about that, Mister. Ben Benziger. Hi, I'm Sam Winston. Hi, Sam. Look, I wanna apologize for 'ol Ed in there. He's had a rough time of it. I guess it's been about five years ago, his wife, his kid and his dog. They all got killed in an automobile accident. Well, he ended up with a metal plate in his head. Oh, golly. I guess the cold weather makes it act up. Anyway, he stays over at the motel in a room the community provides for him. That's nice. Well also, honey, remember you can you kept blasting your horn at him? Yes, dear. Why don't you see if the car will start? You got car trouble? Oh, yeah. Oh, honey, I think you just flooded it. You just flooded it. Thanks again officer. That's okay. The man is obviously some kind of a lunatic. Boy, I would've seen him touch one hair on your head. I don't know, dad. His eyes seemed a little beady, kind of like the eyes of a child. Exactly, and it's that kind of childish behavior which makes him such a menace. Honey, take it easy. Larry, can you dig it? Huh? Right on, sir. You know I would go so far as to say that a lot of these folks look like Medicaid abusers. You know, I imagine- Imagination can be a very dangerous thing. You just can't talk about people like that, especially strangers. How do you know they're nice dad? There it is. Come on, what do you say we go in and change, relax a little and then head back into town for that polka dance. Honey, that's a great idea. This some kind of revenge thing? Oh, country air. There's just nothing like it, is there? Yeah, you're right about that, Mr. Benziger. Dad, could we go inside now? Sure. Honey, do you have the keys? Oh, no. Yeah, I remember now. I put it in here because I wanted to- Oh, jiminy crickets. It's okay, don't get excited everything's all right. Hey, dig this kids. I'll find it in a jiffy. We'll have this baby. Those keys won't even get cold. We'll be in there in just a second I'll have... It's under control. Ben Benziger to the rescue. Cool view, shit. What are you doing? What do you mean, dude? I mean, what are you doing on my bed, dude? Come on Brent, I found it first. I'll tell you what, I'll flip you for it. Larry, I'm warning you, all right? Don't fuck with me. I mean, you're always starting this shit, and I'm gonna kick your ass this time. Don't fuck around man, I'll cut you so fucking fast you've never seen it coming motherfucker. Hey, relax man, I was just kidding. Go ahead take the bed. No, no, that's okay. You take the bed. So what do you think? Simply stunning dear, just stunning. Oh, you always say that. What, relax, I was just put... What, oh come on you don't look that bad. That guy in the diner. Hey, I thought you liked older men. You know I haven't seen any younger guys since we've gotten here. You know I didn't see much in the way of pussy in town man. I thought you liked older women. Although I don't think you're gonna need your old lady spotter in this town. There seems to be a surplus of old meat. Brent, come here quick. Larry stop. Get the hell over here. Larry, stop man, you're on my nerves. What? The girl. The goddamn girl, look! Nice tits I bet. Brent, there was a girl out there. She wasn't looking sexy, she was looking dead or pretty fucking close. There's a big goddamn son of a bitch chasing her with a blade as long as your fucking arm, man. Okay, it's a movie. Yep. Oh, Ben dear, if you're going to talk there really isn't much sense in playing charades, is there? Wait, honey. "Be there or be square," must be a typo. Hi. I'm glad you could come. How about some punch? Sounds great. Thanks. I brought a thermos of hot chocolate for the children. How about it? We gotta talk to you. Hey, there's something going on around here. Yes, Brent it's called Polka. I'm not talking about about the goddamn dance. Relax Brent, you might appear uncool to your public. I'm talking about what we saw driving up here. This place is very, very strange. Very insightful, Brent. Hi, I'm Sam Winston. This is Will Stan. Hi, we're up here vacationing. I'd just like to apologize for this morning. If you have any more trouble with Ed Simpson or anybody for that matter just let me know. With an offer like that perhaps you should get your own police radio, Brent. Careful, Bridge. So, how about a dance? I don't know. Come on Bridgett it will be fun. Is it a genetic thing with you? Be serious. I am. I don't know how they can call this music man. Look at these ridiculous outfits. Brent, what are we gonna do? I don't know man. I'm gonna go to the head, come on, Ginger and Fred. Who? Jesus! What the fuck? Who the hell is this guy man? Somebody's trying to kill us, man. What's this us shit, Kemosabe. Goddamn it man, for once in your life would you be serous? Look at this. Come on, let's just get the fuck out of here. It's nice to see Brent finally having some fun, isn't it honey? That darn Larry's not so bad either. Say, who wants a drink? How about you Little Bo? Yeah, sure. Gimme a whiskey sour. How about you foxy Roxy? Yeah, a whiskey sour sounds great. And what do they call that, the dance I mean. Honey, that's called slam dancing. Slam dancing, how cute. So the other guy gets out of his Cadillac. So the guy leaves his car door open And the deer gets in the guy's car! I swear to God. The deer gets into the guy's car and refuses to get out. So what did he do? This Bud's for you. Wilbur please, I'm trying to tell a story here. All right, go ahead. What's so funny? Sit down, will ya, and have a drink. I'm right in the middle of charming these two young lovely ladies about another fascinating tale of police work. Let's see, where was I? What are we gonna do? They'll put me away for this, what the hell is going on? Pull yourself together man. We'll get help. I got a whole life ahead of me, man. Shit. We gotta find that cop. There's not too many places they could have gone. Come on. I'm trying to get the story out of this guy, so what's going on, a wild dog shows up. Whoa, wait. You told me there were two dogs. Relax Will okay, two more dogs show up. So the guy is trying to say The deer is still in this guy's car. For crying out loud. Will, looks like I'm gonna need a little help on this. You mind? Sure. Excuse us ladies, this will take us a minute. Just settle down Roy, settle down. Listen, are you telling me nothing but the truth? It's a goddamn lie. All right boys, put the bottle down. Put the bottle down then we'll talk. Now, what's the problem? He called Charlie Pry black. Well he is, I've seen him on TV, colored TV. Again, goddamn it. Hey, Brent check it out over there. What's wrong with them? What do you mean? Well, look at the way they're practically on the floor. That's gravity at work, my friend, oh shit, the cop man, the cop. Rox, come on, I can't run anymore. Roxanne! Rox? Come on. Come on, come on. Look, I know you're afraid, all right? We all are all right? We just gotta get the hell out of here. All right. What the hell happened back there? A head, a goddamn head is what I saw. What exactly did you see? A head, I saw a fucking head on a stick. Did you see anybody else? No. I didn't see anyone or anybody. Okay, let's just get out of here, let's go. Up and at 'em! Lots to do. Rise and shine. Come on girls, it's just too nice a day to sleep it away. It's almost 7:30. 7:30, mom we're on vacation. Come on sleepy heads. Oh, this crisp morning air will wake you up. Hey, let's go you two. Life's too short to spend in bed. Dad, we'll meet you after breakfast. No way big guy. You two are gonna need a big breakfast. Looks to me like you two got 30 feet of driveway to shovel. Oh, brother. What's the matter Larry? You're a young healthy guy, up and at 'em. I can't just yet sir, you know what I mean? Oh, hey, you got a little stiffy? You young guys. Honey? No, thank you. Say, are you kids eating breakfast or are you excavating archeological ruins? Dad, we wanna get out of here. Oh, Brent, honey, you've hardly touched your food. It's not the restaurant mom, it's this town. We all wanna go home. What's happening to you kids? That Mr. Benziger seems to be the question of the week. Tell me, sir, doesn't it strike you as odd that we're easily 10 years younger than anybody else in Wilson Creek? Is that all? Larry, the problem is then you just can't find anybody else your own age. No mom, no it's not. It's not that there's no one to play with. Mrs. Benziger, plain and simple, we're afraid. Afraid for us and afraid for you. Oh, afraid for me? Honey, Larry, please don't be silly. Okay, maybe Larry's getting a little carried away, but we are. No, I'm not getting carried away. I firmly believe that something... You must have dropped this. Honey, there's a bingo game over at the lodge this afternoon. I'd really love to try to get over there. I love bingo. I know you do. Larry, honey Are you OK? I'm fine. Who the hell is that? That's the guy I saw through the telescope. How would he know me? Honey. Yeah. Look there's that nice policeman. Hi, Millie. Hi, Sam. you need a menu hun? No, the only thing that changes is the price. Hi. Good morning, folks. Hi. Morning officer. Morning. Would you care to join us? I wish I could, it looks mighty good. I just came by to make sure you all are okay. You all gonna be at the country western dance tonight? - No. - Yes. Well, I hope to see you there. Oh, I almost forgot. We had a little trouble last night, wasn't anything serious. I just wanted to warn you to watch out. I wonder if we can report them to some child labor board. I mean, there's gotta be some old statute that we could dig up. It's not so likely. Sometimes you sound like such a moron. Snow is what we're gonna be digging up. It's cold as a witch's tit. Hellacious. What? Hellacious, the weather. There's no such word Brent. Hey, dudes. Hi, man. I gotta tell you I'm really jealous of you two young bucks going out there shoveling snow. If it wasn't for this damn cold. Yeah, dad we understand. I knew you could dig it. Say Larry, I need to have a word with Brent. Hey, go for it. Well, I was kind of thinking... Hey, say no more. I can dig it. I'm gonna check up on some of that groovy snow. Some kid that Larry. Boy, this cold is something else. You wanted to talk to me dad? Well yeah, your mother and I we... Well I don't know exactly how to... Just spit it out dad. Sure. Sure son. These darn father-son things. What we wanna say is we're worried son. We think it's hormones at work, well, with the way you kids have been acting and all lately. It's not just you. We know that, Lord knows. But we're gonna see you through this thing. You hear me? Damn, this cold. But most importantly, I want you to know that we're behind you on this no matter what. We're a family and it's that bond, a bond of blood which cements the family unit. Brent. Yeah, sure dad thanks. I think we see each other more clearly now. Go on, go on Larry's waiting for you out there. Glad you're seeing about that cold, dad. Hellacious. - Yeah, please, H-E-L-L-A-C-I- - I heard you. There's no such word, trust me. Larry, you trust your parents man? Don't be ridiculous of course not. Larry, the guy in the bathroom, man. Do you think he's dead? No, Brent. He just went home, ate a few aspirins and has completely forgiven you for crushing the side of his head. Why haven't they come after us? But they have, haven't they? And they'll keep coming for us until they get us. What are you talking about man? I think we ought to tell my dad. No. No, what do you mean no man? I think you're fucking crazy. You think I'm crazy? Yeah, you're damn right. I think you're fucking crazy. And don't start flipping that fucking knife around me man, or so help me... So help you what? Stay away from me man. What are you doing? This isn't a fucking game man. Come on, man. Mellow out. Mellow out? You fucking mellow out! Come on! I don't wanna hit you. But you better hit me, because you know I'll fucking hit you. I'm crazy, I'm fucking crazy. Stay away from me man. What the hell are you doing? Don't! Come on, come on Brent. What are you doing? Fuck you man, come on. Come on. I'm so scared you little... Please, please stop the noise. You poor dear, I'm terribly sorry. Aren't you Brent? My friend's a little shy around adults. Larry. Don't worry, we'll be obedient. Just like old Blue here. Stay Blue. You're in great danger. No shit Sherlock. Do you see this? They did that to me. They think I don't remember but I do. They killed my children. They killed my children. They think I don't remember. No Dad, you can't see them. You're watching WJKW television. I hope it can't either. What's the matter boy, monster got your tongue? What the hell is that shit? It's monster food. What? We come down here and we find all them jars that them generic engineers keep their pickled animal parts in? Must be that monster you've been talking about. You assholes don't get it, do you? This thing's real and it's down here. Well, have you seen anything? I don't miss a thing, 20-20 vision. Look, it's a creature, a filmy substance. Boogers. Goddamn it boy, it was just a tremor. This shit happens all the time. There ain't no goddamn monster. They'll kill you too. Who's doing this to us man? They are, I can prove it. Please come with me. Now, that is one thing I would never do. I don't know, I mean if I had a really nice car with this great stereo. You sound like such a yuppie. There's no doubt in my mind rush hour is the greatest curse on contemporary society. Bridge, have you thought any more about college? Oh, what about it? You know like what you gonna major in, where you're gonna go? Well, as long as it's far from home and it is warmer than this, and then to meet boys. Anywhere will do. Want a bite? No thanks, I'll get my own. Have you ever made snow angels? What? Snow angels, you've never made snow angels? No. Oh, my God. I can't believe you're doing this. Come on, it's fun. Try it. What? Oh my God, oh my God. Bridgett, stop. It's OK, it's a doll. My God, hey boys. Hold it a second. I found a quarter. Whoops. It's kind of sad isn't it, I mean, like no marker or anything. This will do till spring. Atta-boy Blue. I remember I always used to wonder why every doll I owned could pee in its pants but they never found- Very profound, Bridgett. Listen. What? That singing, you hear it? That's beautiful. Come on, let's check it out. Get out of here I mean what if she sees us or something? It's not exactly illegal. Let's go. Bridgett, oh my God, that smells so good. I know, I'm starving. Bridgett, let's get out of here. Now what's wrong? Look, it could be lots of things. Yeah, but it isn't. It isn't lots of things, is it? Not here, not in this- You're starting to scare me. Let's just look a little closer, come on. Come on. You oughta be more careful. The roads are slippery. Thank you. Okay. I hope this guy's motel room is in better shape than his truck. It's gotta be in better shape than he is. Well, the truck made it. Great maybe our luck's changing. You know, your feet are disgusting. Not very impressive am I? Well, let's put it this way. I don't think Cinderella would have scored a prince with puke on her glass slippers God, give me a break. I mean that was absolutely disgusting you've got to admit. And I can't believe you took it so well. Well, I didn't exactly. What? At least you didn't barf all over yourself. No. What? God, you sound like Arnold the pig. I peed in my pants. No! I swear to God I did. And now you know I did it! I hope that it's not too comfortable. Oh, Rox. But at least it keeps away the evil spirits. Where do they find these girls? They're not girls, Brent. Please tell me what they are then, I'd hate to screw one by mistake. They're women. Just when does a girl become a woman? Got any Coke for this? That my friend is a very insightful question. For that matter when does a boy become a man? What are you talking about? Just drink it. It's not gonna kill you. As a matter of fact, it just might save your life. Pretend I'm stupid. It's simple, does your dad drink? Of course, he lives with my mom. Your father's a man Brent. You're real good at this. Brent I think the reason these people are trying to kill us is because we're kids. They don't seem to be fucking with your folks now, do they? Go on. All right, turn this shit off. Have you seen this before? Sure, it's the same one my folks got, why? Ed Simpson also had one. I think this is what he wanted to show us. Great, it's a big secret and we've already seen it. No we haven't. We haven't already seen it. Did you ever think to open the fucking thing? "A place to bring the kids and leave your troubles behind." I hope the girls are OK. Don't worry we'll find them. Jesus Christ, does everybody watch this shit? I don't think it's a TV. What is that? Doesn't sound like boffing. How would you know? TV. I'm gonna go check it out. How are you gonna get in? Trust me. A quick roll of the lock, and presto. Hello? Come on, dude. Let's get out of here. Oh, my God, it's her. It's who? The one in the woods, get my knife. Hey, come on down from there honey. It's the end of the line. I wanna go home. Brent, where's Larry? In there. It's OK, it's not my blood. They know where the dance is. If they wanna have a good time they'll show up. Exactly right. Honey, look. Isn't that cute? I don't think I've ever seen one shaped like a dog before. ♪ Figaro figaro figaro figaro ♪ Hey, come on guys, we're not dead yet. That's very encouraging Larry. But it is, we still have time. Great, time for what? Time to grow up. Exactly, yeah. Come on, let's get out of here. No. What do you mean no? You know Larry, you're beginning to look like one of those lunatic TV preachers. Excellent, I'll attack their religion. Brilliant, here. Look don't you see Bridge, the only way to beat them is to join them. No Brent, I don't see. And join who? Their society, the adults. Look we gotta stop being kids. I mean how many times have you heard grow up, or stop acting like a kid? We haven't conformed, don't you see? I'm gonna go for their cultural centers. Okay, but how are we- Undercover, we're going to become functional members of an adult society. You can go for their legal system. What's that cops name? Sam. What does Sam have to do with all this? I'm beginning to think that this is some kind of adolescent paranoid fantasy. And frankly Larry, I haven't a clue as to what's going on here. You know, you're beginning to sound like an adult already. You might wanna visit our friend next door. I'm not going into anyone else's room. I don't think she'll mind. I'm convinced, I'm convinced you're a fucking idiot. Bridge, I saw her too. OK, I believe you. Hey guys, come over here. Bingo. OK, what do I do? Bless you my son. Oh, I think I'm allergic to this. Quit fucking with it, my son. Good evening reverend. All right, let's kick some ass. Hi. Wonder where he is. Maybe that's him. Hey dude. Hey, howdy partner. Where the Sam hell you been? We've been looking all over for you. Come on, let's go. Sorry man, weather slowed me up. It's so refreshing to have such pleasant young adults join us. The important thing is the community, isn't it? To the community. Look at that, what the hell is that? Is that a guitar or a lollipop? Just need a second to change the old G string. Oh, don't worry about it. You look fine the way you are. All right guys, let's go. Let's hit it one, two, three, four. Evening ladies. You look lovely tonight. They sure do, don't they? Would you care to dance? Love to. Well, mount up woman. Excellent punch, isn't it reverend? Excellent punch. Benziger, Ben Benziger. I'm sort of on retreat here. Baptist. Is that a fact? Funny, you don't look Baptist. Looks can be deceiving, can't they? Sometimes. Surely you have a favorite passage. Well, I'm kind of partial to the Sodom and Gomorrah stuff. And you? Abraham. The one who stabbed his son. I'd like you to visit our church. It has quite a history you know. I bet. Bet, I insist. It's practically right next door. How fortunate. Ben, I don't understand him. I don't know why he can't play like everyone else. Let's hit it, one, two, three, four. ♪ Halleluiah halleluiah halleluiah ♪ ♪ Halleluiah halleluiah ♪ Got any more whiskey? There's wine inside. ♪ Halleluiah ♪ My son, you know I'm going to kill you.

There's no room in this world for people like you. You mean this town ain't big enough for the two of us. Every generation you come here with your youth, your new ideas. But you see, we're bigger than you are. Come on, goddamn it. Don't act like you ain't never done it before. I had you pegged as a little slut the first time I laid my eyes on you. OK, Wilbur. Just let me fix myself up. A woman's got the right to say no, not that I would of course. There. Now how do I look? Stunning. Pick a window, you're leaving. I don't think I'm dead, it's cold as hell. Hellacious. Yeah. Ben, is my hair all right? You look stunning dear. Simply stunning. You always say that. Yeah, I guess I do. So where's Sam? You should be hearing from him right about now. Hi, now you need a menu hon? No, thanks. The only thing that ever changes is the price.
