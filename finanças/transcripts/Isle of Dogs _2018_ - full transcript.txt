Subtitles by explosiveskull Resync by GoldenBeard (WIND HOWLING) (BANGS GONG) (LIGHTS MATCHSTICK) Ten centuries ago, before the Age of Obedience, free dogs roamed at liberty, marking their territory. Seeking to extend its dominion, the cat-loving Kobayashi Dynasty declared war and descended in force upon the unwary four-legged beasts. On the eve of total canine annihilation, a child warrior sympathetic to the plight of the besieged underdog dogs betrayed his species, beheaded the head of the head of the Kobayashi clan and pledged his sword with the following battle-cry haiku. I turn my back On man-kind! Frost on window-pane. He would later be known as the Boy Samurai of Legend, RIP. At the end of the bloody dog wars, the vanquished mongrels became powerless house-pets: tamed, mastered, scorned. But they survived and multiplied. The Kobayashis, however, never forgave their conquered foe. (DRUMMING) (SHOUTS) NARRATOR: The Japanese archipelago, 20 years in the future. (SPEAKING JAPANESE) NARRATOR: Canine Saturation has reached epidemic proportions. An outbreak of Snout-fever rips through the City of Megasaki. Blizzards of infected fleas, worms, ticks and lice menace the citizenship. Dog-Flu threatens to cross the species threshold and enter the human disease-pool. (KOBAYASHI SPEAKING JAPANESE) NARRATOR: (IN ENGLISH) In a special midnight-session at the Municipal Dome, Mayor Kobayashi of Uni Prefecture issues emergency orders calling for a hasty quarantine: the expulsion and containment of all breeds, both stray and domesticated. By official decree, Trash Island becomes an exile colony. BANISH ALL DOGS. Save Megasaki City of Uni Prefecture! (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) NARRATOR: (IN ENGLISH) The Isle of Dogs. (SPEAKING JAPANESE) (IN ENGLISH) Respect-o. (SPEAKING JAPANESE) (CLEARS THROAT) (SPEAKING JAPANESE) NELSON: (IN ENGLISH) It's not fair to the dogs. The path favored by Mayor Kobayashi is cruel and unscientific. For a thousand years, these resilient animals have loved, served and protected us. Now, in their time of greatest need, we forsake them again? A tidal-wave of Anti-Dog hysteria has crippled our moral judgment. Give me six months, and I will deliver a serum. I'm this close, dammit. Dog-Flu will be eradicated. Snout-fever will be defeated. Canine Saturation will be returned to sustainable levels and without mass-neutering! (SPEAKING JAPANESE) (IN ENGLISH) Whatever happened to man's best friend? (CROWD JEERING) No, no, no! The crowd is calling for the immediate ratification and approval of the mayor's proposal. (SPEAKING JAPANESE) NELSON: (IN ENGLISH) As a gesture of public solidarity, Mayor Kobayashi is calling upon his Assistant Hatchet-Man, Major-Domo, to furnish the personal bodyguard-dog of the mayoral-household, Spots Kobayashi, into the possession of the Committee for Canine Desaturation. Spots will be the first dog to be officially deported from the city. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) (WIND HOWLING) (RAT SQUEAKING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) NARRATOR: Six months later. (BARKING) (SQUAWKING) NARRATOR: Nomadic packs of once-domesticated house-pets, sick and hungry, rove the garbage canyons and filthy ravines, scrounging for scraps. One hundred per cent test positive for the Dog-Flu germ. Symptoms: weight-loss, dizziness, narcolepsy, insomnia, and extreme/aggressive behavior. (GROWLING) Three-quarters display signs of early-onset Snout-fever: high-temperature, low blood-pressure, acute moodiness and spasmodic nasal expiration. The exiled dog-population grows weaker, sadder, angrier. Desperate. (ALL GROWLING) (GROWLING CONTINUES) Hey, wait a second. Before we attack each other and tear ourselves to shreds like a pack of maniacs, let's just open the sack first and see what's actually in it. It might not even be worth the trouble. What do you say? I'm not sure. Maybe. Alright. A rancid apple core; two worm-eaten banana peels; a moldy rice cake; a dried-up pickle; tin of sardine bones; a pile of broken egg-shells; an old, smushed-up, rotten gizzard with maggots all over it... Okay, it's worth it. (ALL BARKING) (HOWLS) (ALL PANTING) Get out of here and don't come back. Sheesh, Igor. I think he chewed your ear off. IGOR: Hmm... Hmm. (SNEEZES) (FLIES BUZZING) (RATS SQUEAKING) (SPITS) I don't think I can stomach any more of this garbage. Same here. Words out of my mouth. I used to sleep on a lamb's-wool bean-bag next to an electric space-heater. That's my territory. I'm an indoor dog. I starred in 22 consecutive Doggy-Chop commercials. Look at me now. I couldn't land an audition. I was the lead mascot for an undefeated high-school baseball team. (SNEEZES) I lost all my spirit. I'm depressing. I only ask for what I've always had: a balanced diet, regular grooming, and a general physical once a year. I think I might give up. What, right now? Right now. There's no future on Trash Island. (SNEEZES) You heard the rumor, right? About Buster. KING: Not sure. Can you remind me? Who's Buster? Uh, my brother from another litter. What happened to him? Suicided. Hanged himself by his own leash. - Hmm. - Oh, boy. I want my master. CHIEF: (SCOFFING) Ah... You make me sick. (VOMITS) I've seen cats with more balls than you dogs. Stop licking your wounds! You hungry? Kill something and eat it. You sick? Take a long nap. You cold? Dig a hole in the ground, crawl into it, and bury yourself. But nobody's giving up around here, and don't you forget it, ever. You're Rex! You're King! You're Duke! You're Boss! I'm Chief. We're a pack of scary, indestructible Alpha Dogs. You're talking like a bunch of house-broken... pets. You don't understand. Uh, how could you? You're a... Go ahead, say it. I'm a stray, yeah. (RUSTLING) (SNEEZES) How does she keep her fur so clean? There's no shampoo on Trash Island. You heard the rumor, right? About her and Felix. What'd they say? Felix? No. What happened to them? They mated. (KING INHALES SHARPLY) Ooh. (BOSS CLEARS THROAT) Who is Felix again? All the ones I like: they're never in heat. Hey, now, that puddle-jumper's flying crooked. - Oh, you're right. - Ease up. Pull up. He's gonna lose a wing. (ENGINE SPUTTERING) (GASPS) Wow. (BREATHING HEAVILY) (GRUNTS) NARRATOR: Part One: The Little Pilot." Small guy. Not much meat on him. Yeah, is he dead? He looks dead. I have a question. Are we eating him, or is this a rescue? We don't know yet. Nobody's eating the little pilot. Not even the dead body of him. Dogs don't eat masters. You're not our leader. We all are. Let's take a vote. All in favor of not eating the little pilot, say "Aye". ALL: Aye. CHIEF: Nay. (GROWLS) First-things-first: let's open his helmet so he can breathe some air if he's alive, then see if we can pull that hunk of broken propeller-clutch out of the side of his head if it doesn't kill him. Does that sound right? ALL: Yeah, that's right. KING: Mmm-hmm. (BREATHING HEAVILY) (SPEAKING JAPANESE) (SNEEZES) (CONTINUES BREATHING HEAVILY) Spots-u! Spots-u! Spots-u! (IN ENGLISH) We get the idea. You're looking for your lost dog, Spots. - Does anybody know him? - Hmm. No. Uh-uh. (GRUNTING) - (ALL GASP) - Wow. (CROWD CHEERING) (CHEERING) (WHISPERING IN JAPANESE) NELSON: (IN ENGLISH) In response to questions regarding the purported disappearance of his ward Atari, Mayor Kobayashi offers no comment and urges reporters to respect the privacy of the mayoral-household. Atari, aged 12, was last seen early yesterday morning rolling a small airplane onto a runway at Megasaki Executive Airport. (ATARI WHISTLING) NARRATOR: 24 hours later. (WHISTLING CONTINUES) (GROWLS) I bite. I beg your pardon. Ignore that dog. He's got Snout-fever. Just please follow us. (SNEEZES) REX: Now, I never met him, but I asked around. I understand he made a lot of friends. He had a very good-natured temperament, I'm told. Of course, you would know best. It's just a bit further up here on the left. Anyway, as I say, he seemed to have been an extremely pleasant animal. Unfortunately, nobody could figure out how to open his dog-cage. NARRATOR: Three years earlier. NELSON: The sole survivor of last week's colossal bullet-train disaster, a young boy named Atari, awoke from a deep-coma early this morning to learn of his parents' tragic deaths and also the intention of his distant-uncle, Mayor Kobayashi, to personally adopt him as ward to the mayoral-household. Upon his release from Megasaki General, Atari who suffered the loss of his right kidney and numerous broken bones in the crash will live in sequestered quarters within the confines of Brick Mansion, where he will be educated in solitude by private tutors. Atari has also been assigned a security-detail for his own protection in the form of a highly trained bodyguard-dog named Spots Kobayashi. (MONITOR BEEPING) (MAJOR-DOMO SPEAKING JAPANESE) (IN ENGLISH) Um, you're my new master. My name is Spots. I'm at your service. I'll be protecting your welfare and safety on an ongoing-basis.

I am not gonna fight this robot! I'm against the little pilot, remember? I don't even believe in masters. You're the best in a scrap. We all know that. You like to fight. Well, let's take a vote.

(DOGS BARKING) (GROWLS) (BARKING CONTINUES) (SPEAKING JAPANESE) (ALARM BLARING) (SPEAKING JAPANESE) (IN ENGLISH) My ward, Atari, has been kidnapped against his will by a pack of disobedient, contagious, infected animals. He will be rescued promptly, returned to safety, and grounded for the duration of his childhood years. His five dog-abductors have been identified through the use of advanced Tooth-and-Tail Recognition Software: They will, of course, be captured and violently destroyed.

You're disobedient! Sit! No. (MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) (SNEEZES) (WIND HOWLING) (MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING) NUTMEG: I wouldn't drink that, if I were you. It's full of toxic chemicals. How do you know? Because my sister-in-law drank it, and her tongue turned black. Oh. You're Felix's mate. I beg your pardon? I mean, I think you mated with Felix, if I heard it right? That's none of your business. No, no, I don't suggest whether it actually happened or not. I'm just saying that I recognize you from when I heard that rumor. (SNEEZES) I think I'm going to say good-night. Wait, wait, wait. No. Wait. Start over. Who cares about Felix? I'm Chief. (CLEARS THROAT) That's my name. I see. I'm introducing myself. Who are you? I thought you knew all about me. (CHUCKLES) No, I don't know anything. I should've kept my mouth shut. It's all hearsay. Anyway, you're Nutmeg. So you do know me, after all. After all? Yes. You a show-dog, Nutmeg? I was bred as a show-dog. I was groomed for that purpose. It wasn't my choice. I don't consider it my identity. Anyway, look around. What difference does it make now? So that's a yes. So that's a: yes, I used to be. May I join you? (NUTMEG GASPS) You've been attacked. Hmm. What else is new? You should see the other dog. (CLEARS THROAT) Actually, I think he was made of stainless-steel. I couldn't get my teeth into him. Who is the little pilot? What'd he do? Why are they after him? Nobody knows. You're a stray, aren't you? Yes, I'm a stray. But aren't we all? In the last analysis, I mean? Were you trained? For competition. I was a show-dog. You know a few tricks, then. A few. Can I see one? Maybe if I get to know you better. Fair enough. It's not true, by the way. About me and Felix. For the record. I wouldn't bring puppies into this world. I don't believe in masters. I never did. It's against my principles. But this is no place for a dog like you. You belong somewhere. You've got papers. Oh, I'm full-grown, sweetheart. You don't have to worry about me. Good-night. I hope I'll see you again. - Here's one. - One what? I'm supposed to be spinning a nine-pound bowling-ball over my head at this point, but you just have to imagine that part. Oh. I can picture it. Will you help him? The little pilot? Why should I? Because he's a 12-year-old boy. Dogs love those. KING: Spots, whoever he is, might be alive, and he might be dead, but one thing's for sure: he's nowhere around here. He's not in the dog-community. There's probably another 500 Japanese hectares of unmapped waste-land on Trash Island at least. Where do we start? (CLEARS THROAT) Also, the mental health question: maybe it's because of that propeller-clutch stuck in the side of his head I can't say, I'm not a doctor, but I think the little pilot's got a screw loose. Those are the cons. You heard the rumor, right? About the little pilot. Which rumor? What is that? Kobayashi is his distant uncle. He's the mayor's ward. - What? - ALL: Whoa. Be that as it may, let's look at the pros. That boy flew here, all alone, and crash-landed onto this island for one reason; one reason only: to find his dog. To the best of my knowledge, no other master, not one single human master, has made any effort to do that. They've forgotten all about us. I propose we start tomorrow, first-light. We'll cross the Middle Fingers. We'll find the tugboat on the Dune. We'll go see Jupiter and Oracle. They'll know what to do. Let's take a vote. All in favor say "Aye". - ALL: Aye. - CHIEF: Nay. Who's the nay-sayer? - ALL: Him. - CHIEF: Me. That kid is gonna get us all put to sleep. Euthanized. We won't find the dog, but we will die trying. Not a bad way to go. You're out-voted, anyway.

Thank you, Editor-Hiroshi. You all know me. I speak my mind, and sometimes that ruffles some feathers. Please, forgive my bluntness. Mayor Kobayashi is a crook, and I hate him. Right now, he faces a divided congress during a hotly-contested re-election year. Dogs are dying on a miserable island. Gullible masters have been brainwashed. The Science-Party Candidate is being held against his will with no recourse to legal counsel. Somebody is up to something. (STUDENTS SPEAKING JAPANESE) (IN ENGLISH) You have a conspiracy theory? I have a hunch. I don't print hunch. (STUDENTS CHATTERING) Huh? I'll spell it out. I believe Municipal Dome propaganda has deliberately stoked irrational, Anti-Dog fear and suppressed a medically proven Dog-Flu treatment in order to promote a secret campaign to turn the country against its innocent house-pets.

I've only got three captures on my record where I actually got sent to the pound, I mean, and the first two times, I escaped within 24 hours, but the third time... (WIND HOWLING) I got adopted before I could finish digging the break-out-tunnel. It was a big family. Five kids. Two other dogs, already. They stuck me in the back of a station-wagon and drove me out to the middle of the sticks. Grass, trees, swimming pool. Cartoons on TV. Anyway, one morning a week later, the youngest boy, his name was Toshiro, woke me up at 6:15, bright-eyed, wide-awake, and he tried to pet me. He didn't mean anything by it. He was just being friendly. Apparently, I bit him so hard, I nearly chewed his hand off. Blood all over the kitchen floor. They rushed him to the emergency room and I got pad-locked out in the tool-shed with the lights out. It gave me some time to think. What happened? Why did I do that? To this day, I have no idea. I guess he scared me. I bite. That night, an old woman, she must've been the grandmother brought me out a bowl of some homemade hibachi-chili. I like to think she cooked it for me, personally -but who knows? Maybe it was just more left-overs. But... You've got a tick. (SPITS) Anyway, that's my favorite food I ever ate. The old woman made a great bowl of chili. What happened after that? I dug my way out by morning, jumped on the back of a dump-truck, and hitched back to Megasaki. I was always a street-dog, let's face it. (RUSTLING) Somebody's stalking us. (SPEAKING JAPANESE) SIMUL-TRANSLATE: (IN ENGLISH) As you know, we all hate dogs.

(WEATHERMAN SPEAKING JAPANESE) (SNEEZES) You seek a dog named Spots. - Dog-Zero. - Dog-Zero. As you know, most of the animals on this island come from human homes with domesticated back-grounds. However, a small population of savage, aboriginal dogs have been scavenging the Metropolitan Dumping-Grounds for nearly a decade. The graffiti on this wall depicts the story. They were born into captivity on the ends of the fringes of the most distant reaches of the island. They endured great suffering and cruelty at the hands of their former masters. Finally, in the wake of an Act of God, they escaped- to a harsh and desperate freedom. Some say they died away over the subsequent years, starving and forgotten. Some say they swam to the mainland, but this seems unlikely. Too far to dog-paddle. Some say they're still with us, in the Far-away Cuticles, beyond the Middle Fingers. We know the animal you seek. He has appeared in Oracle's visions. (MAN SPEAKING JAPANESE ON TV) (IN ENGLISH) A prophecy suggests itself: Spots, if he's alive, may very well be living, even at this moment, as a captive prisoner abducted into the company of these wild, savage dogs.

That's Butterscotch, and she got crushed in a glass compactor the day before yesterday. No, my duties are, uh, focused entirely on the protection of the mayor's ward, Atari. I'm not supposed to be his friend, but I love him very much, but that's a private matter. Um, the only reason I even said that was because we're all probably going to die out here and I'll never see him again. (SPOTS SNIFFLING) That's a tough break. Well, good luck to you and watch out for the cannibal-dogs. - Hmm? - SCRAP: Hmm? - What? - What? Watch out for the...? The cannibal-dogs. They are dogs that eat dogs. Start over and repeat again. You know what? Don't even worry about that. I just heard there might be some wild, aboriginal, cannibal-dogs in the area, you know, but I wouldn't worry because you're in an extra-security lock cell. Look at it that way. You're probably safer than I am. Except from thirst and starvation. It's got an extra-security lock on it. You'll never get it open. Are you going to eat me now? What did you say? Are you going to eat me now? I heard you were cannibal-dogs. Be notified: I'll be compelled to defend myself with all means at my disposal. (LAUGHS) Hmm. Who told you that dirty lie? We resorted to cannibalism on one occasion, many months ago, as a desperate survival instinct. We ate one single dog. His name was Fuzzball, and he was the leader of our pack, and he was already in a coma from starvation, so we put him out of his... his... (STAMMERS) (HOWLING) (DOGS HOWLING) His misery and... and... consumed him. (HOWLING) (DOGS HOWLING) We would have dropped dead in a week or less without that nourishment. We were dying. Do you judge us for that? Shame on you! We only brought you here in the first place to help you. (HOWLING) (DOGS HOWLING) We've got a Master Pass-Key! Open his cage. PEPPERMINT: Fuzzball was his best friend. Oh, dear. Uh, I think I offended him. I'm truly sorry. I had no idea. What is this place? How long have you been here? I can see you've been mistreated. (SNIFFLES) (SIGHS DEEPLY) Are you okay? My name is Spots. Spots Kobayashi. How can I be of service to you? SPOTS: Master Atari-san, can you hear me? Can you hear me, Master Atari? (GASPS) Spots-u? You're not safe here! You shouldn't have come for me! I can't protect you efficiently under these conditions! Spots-u! Here I come. Sic-'em! (DOGS BARKING) Follow me! (ATARI SCREAMS) REX: All in favor of kicking Chief out of the pack and never speaking to him again, say "Aye". ALL: Aye! (SPLASH) How did you do that? Secret tooth! Military issue! Technically, I could do it 37 more times, but I wouldn't be able to chew my meat! I assume you're Spots! We've been looking for you. (SPEAKING JAPANESE) Master Atari-san, I swore an oath when I assumed the responsibilities of official bodyguard-dog to the mayoral-household! I could never be persuaded to break that vow for any reason whatsoever! I'll always be loyal to you as my only and unconditional master! But circumstances have radically changed for me and all the pets of Megasaki City! I have new obligations which I never anticipated! I've become the leader of a tribe of outcasts who depend on me for their survival, and I'm going to be a father! With deepest sadness and humility: I must ask you to relieve me of the duties of my position, effective immediately. You son of a bitch. If we don't drown, I'm going to strangle you myself. I don't care how many exploding teeth you try to spit-out at me. Do you have any idea what that little pilot just went through to try to rescue you? How dare you? - You're a stray. - Yeah, so what? What's your name? Who cares? You're from central Megasaki. I can tell by the accent. You're a short-haired-Oceanic- speckle-ear/sport-hound-mix. You were born in a storm-sewer on Bamboo-shoot Holiday six years ago today. Do you know me? I... I don't... I don't know. I'm your older brother by five minutes. It's been a long time, Chief. Was... Was I the runt? Not anymore. NELSON: Security-camera footage confirms initial-reports of the deaths of mayoral-ward Atari Kobayashi and his five dog-abductors this afternoon in a sluice channel at the threshold of the Far-Away Cuticles. A statement from Major-Domo, live at Brick Mansion: (SPEAKING JAPANESE) (IN ENGLISH) The life of a promising young orphan has been cut short before its prime. This is a distant-uncle's worst nightmare. Mayor Kobayashi asks for your prayers, your condolences and your support for the diligent men and women of the Municipal Task Force Dog-Catchers Division: we salute you for your bravery and your ongoing commitment to the continuing punishment of all bad-dogs. Originally, before the volcano erupted and an earthquake triggered the tsunami which obliterated the facility, there were over 250 incarcerated animals here on the premises being experimented on against their will. If you look closely, you may notice some of these dogs still bear scars and markings from the research and abuse. Actually, it's pretty obvious. This is my mate, Peppermint. She's pregnant with our first litter. She was due a week ago. (WHISPERING) (CLEARS THROAT) Anyway, the survivors of the disaster learned to cultiv... What's he got there? What's he got there? Biscuit-o. Biscuit-o. Biscuit-o. Puppy-Snaps. (CHUCKLES) I heard they don't even make them anymore. You heard the rumor, right? About Kobayashi Pharmaceutical. I never heard it. What rumor? They invented Dog-Flu. - No. - Of course. That makes sense. Where do you get all these rumors? I mean, who tells them to you? I don't know. Anybody. Dogs talk, and I listen. Always have. I, uh, love gossip. GONDO: Spots! The black owl has a message. (PANTING) (HOOTING) He's come from all the way across the island. Get him a cup of sewer-water, Chico. (CONTINUES HOOTING) SPOTS: Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Yes. We understand. He has news from the Metropolitan Dumping-Grounds. ALL: Metropolitan... Shh! Quiet, please. We're listening, owl. Tell us your message. (DOGS BARKING IN DISTANCE) He's going to poison us. Re-election Night: at the moment Mayor Kobayashi is re-inaugurated, he'll give the order, and the extermination-process will begin. Oracle saw the plan in her visions. (MAYOR KOBAYASHI SPEAKING JAPANESE ON TV) NELSON: If the voters choose me again on Re-Election Night, I promise: a final and permanent end to the Canine Saturation-crisis. JUPITER: Every pet in the Trash Island Camp will die. It may be too late, already; but, if the black owl reaches you with this message in time: Go to Megasaki City. Find our masters. Appeal to the people. Stop the mayor. Save us. (SPEAKING JAPANESE) (IN ENGLISH) We're crossing the river tonight. Begin preparations immediately. You'll meet a bitch named Nutmeg. Tell her Chief says: I'll see you in Megasaki. (OWL HOOTS) (DRUMMING) (BOTH GRUNTING) (DRUMMING CONTINUES) (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) (DRUMMING STOPS) Hmm. Beautiful night. Peppermint's in labor. Oh. Come sit beside me. It's okay. (SIGHS) Master Atari, are you willing to accept my brother Chief as new bodyguard-dog in personal service to you, former ward to the mayoral-household? (SPEAKING JAPANESE) Chief, are you willing to accept Atari as your direct master, to serve and protect his safety and welfare with all courage, loyalty and friendship? I can do that. Good. (DEVICE BEEPS) (WHINING) (CHIEF WHISTLING) (ALL WHISTLING) (MUSIC PLAYING) Chocolate milk, cold. Tracy Walker, Megasaki Senior High, Daily-Manifesto. Are you Professor Watanabe's former Assistant-Scientist, Yoko-ono-san? Do I have it? (SPEAKING JAPANESE) (IN ENGLISH) Too late. Do I have it? Too late. (SPEAKING JAPANESE) (IN ENGLISH) Nobody care. (OBJECTS CLATTERING) Do I have it? Do I have the story? Yes or no? On the record! I am sorry for your loss, but we both know: that was no suicide! I need to prove my conspiracy-theory! Ben is dead. No future on Trash Island. I am failure. (GLASS SHATTERS) Pull yourself together and act like a scientist! Professor Watanabe never gave up. Is this... Is this the serum? The Dog-Flu cure? The Snout-fever treatment? The end of the Canine Saturation-crisis? Last dose. Tracy: be careful. NARRATOR: Part Four: "Atari's Lantern." TRACY: Not fair! ALL: To dogs! TRACY: Not fair! ALL: To dogs! TRACY: Not fair! ALL: To dogs! (KOBAYASHI SPEAKING JAPANESE) There will never be a place for Dog-Flu in Megasaki City. There will never be room for Snout-fever in Uni Prefecture. The time has come to put the violent, intimidating, unsanitary bad-dogs of Trash Island humanely to sleep. For their own good; and also: ours. General Yamatachi? Bring out the replacement-pet. (IN ENGLISH) Sit-o! (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) The results are in! Stand by for the incoming Re-Election Night tally! (ANNOUNCER SPEAKING JAPANESE) (AUDIENCE CHEERING ON TV) TRACY: That crook! He's stealing the re-election again! Let's go! (AUDIENCE CHEERING) (KOBAYASHI SPEAKING JAPANESE) This landslide re-election is a massive fraud, and we demand a re-count! (IN ENGLISH) Respect-o. The mayor is allowing the unauthorized Pro-Dog student-protestors a platform to voice their dissenting beliefs! Mayor Kobayashi has dog's-blood on his hands! You all do! Atari was a hero. Professor Watanabe was murdered. The serum works! The mayor is a crook, and I hate him. (SPEAKING JAPANESE) This small minority of dog-lovers has been sent by overseas special-interest groups to agitate disorder and incite anarchy. I hereby cancel and nullify Foreign-exchange student Walker's senior high school study-visa. She will be expelled from class, stripped of her course-credits, and formally deported on the next direct-flight back to Cincinnati, Ohio. Oh. Hmm. (SPEAKING JAPANESE) Mayor Kobayashi has directed Major-Domo to bring him the red button. (BEEPING) Nutmeg! (CHIEF SNEEZES) (ALL GASP) (SNEEZES) (GASPS) (INHALES DEEPLY) Holy smokes! My lungs feel clear. My equilibrium feels balanced. My vision is sharp as a tack for the first time in months. Wow, that's a great serum! Master Atari, whose death, I think we can say, appears to have been inaccurately reported, has asked to read a statement to the General Assembly. He will then withdraw from the debate and respond to no further questions. (SPEAKING JAPANESE) (IN ENGLISH) Dear Editor-Hiroshi of the Megasaki Senior High Daily-Manifesto: in a series of first-rate articles by an attractive cub-reporter on your staff, you shine a spot-light on the great injustice that has occurred under the Kobayashi Administration. I have spent much of my time in recent weeks traveling in the company of the very kind of animals our mayor refers to as "bad-dogs." They are the finest living-beings I have ever come to know in all my dozen years on this earth. To your readers, the good people of Megasaki, I say: the cycle of life always hangs in a delicate balance. Who are we, and who do we want to be? (IN ENGLISH) Who are we? (CONTINUES SPEAKING JAPANESE) (IN ENGLISH) I wrote a haiku to try to express my feelings about the suffering dogs of Trash Island. It is also about nature, love, friendship, eternity, and a black owl. I call it: Atari's Lantern. (SPEAKING JAPANESE) (GASPS) He said a haiku. (SOBBING) I'll tell you later. (SPEAKING JAPANESE) (IN ENGLISH) I dedicate this poem to my distant-uncle, Mayor Kobayashi, who took me in when I myself was a stray-dog with nowhere else to turn. Editor-Hiroshi, please extend my subscription for an additional year. I enclose a check in the amount of one thousand yen. Signed, Atari Kobayashi, former ward to the mayoral-household. (GRUNTS) Hmm. (GROWLS) (WHISTLING) (SPEAKING JAPANESE) NELSON: Not-fair-to-the-boy. Not-fair-to-the-dog. He says: "I-have-no-honor." (GROWLS) Hmm? (AUDIENCE GASP) NELSON: Holy Moses! The mayor has just officially unstamped the Trash Island Decree! No kidding! (SPEAKING JAPANESE) (BOTH ARGUING IN JAPANESE) (STAMMERING) Major-Domo is accusing the mayor of breaking his campaign promise! He's steaming mad! (SHOUTING IN JAPANESE) (GASPS) It's gonna be a fight! Spit him with a tooth! I can't get a clean shot. Too many innocent protesters. I'll be right back. (AUDIENCE GASPING) (AUDIENCE GASPS) (MAJOR-DOMO YELLS) (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) (GUN HISSING) (GRUNTS) (ALARM BLARING ON TV) Escape! Escape! Escape! Escape! (SIREN BLARING) Well, the brain surgery was a complete success. But his left kidney failed due to the stress of the operation. (IN ENGLISH) But, what about the right one? He lost it in a train-crash three years ago. (KOBAYASHI SIGHS) (SPEAKING JAPANESE) Take my left kidney... give it to Atari-kun. (MONITOR BEEPING) (BOTH SPEAKING IN JAPANESE) (MONITOR BEEPING) NELSON: According to a long-standing statute unique to Uni Prefecture, in the event of the death, disappearance, or felony-prosecution of the chosen candidate on, while, during, or concurrent with the Re-Election-Night ceremony, all powers and authorities vested in his or her designated office transfer forthwith to his or her next-of-kin and/or appointed heir. In other words, Atari Kobayashi is the new mayor of Megasaki City! You heard me right: Atari Kobayashi is the new mayor of Megasaki City! Let's hope that new kidney works. (SIGHS) Boy, what a night! NARRATOR: Life in Uni Prefecture returned to a comfortable tranquility. The Megasaki Dragons ended their winning streak with a staggering loss to the Honda Goblins. Doggy-Chop re-opened all 11 of its domestic factories- and Puppy-Snaps resumed production with an improved product. Graft and political corruption were reduced to sustainable, acceptable levels. The Dog-Flu serum cured every breathing-animal in the region. (HOST SPEAKING JAPANESE ON TV) NARRATOR: Some say a few lost-dogs continue to roam and scavenge on Trash Island. (SNEEZES) However, these rumors remain unconfirmed. (HIROSHI SPEAKING JAPANESE) SIMUL-TRANSLATE: (IN ENGLISH) Mayor Atari, we all agree it should be a crime to abuse, beat, murder or yell at any dog in Megasaki City. That is not the question. The question is: what is the appropriate punishment? Exactly. And the answer is: Death Penalty. That seems excessive to us. Possibly. Anyway, we should make it at least 30 days community-service and a fine of no less than 250,000 yen. Meeting adjourned. (SPEAKING JAPANESE) I'm standing-by, Master Atari. NUTMEG: So how does it feel to be a former stray? Hmm. I take it one day at a time. Last week, I nearly be-handed an industrial lobbyist from West Suzuki. They had to give him a blood transfusion. He probably had it coming. (CHUCKLES) Maybe. Learned any new tricks? Actually, yes. Just one. Can I see it? I'm supposed to be juggling ten bowling-pins engulfed in flames over my tail at this point, but you just have to imagine that part. (CHUCKLES) I can picture it. You still against bringing puppies into this world? I'll tell you when I get to know you better. Fair enough. My friends think I like to fight, but it's just not true. Sometimes I lose my temper and blow off a little steam, but I've never enjoyed it. I'm not a violent dog. I don't know why I bite. I'm not attracted to tame animals. Thank you.
