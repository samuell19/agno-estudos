(girls screaming) It's just that none of those girls really knew me. I'd go out there on stage and they'd just scream. I didn't have to sing or do anything.

I can do it for you, babe. I don't know why I agreed to marry you, without your hair color. You wouldn't recognize me. We're in fried food, Alabama. It's cold and crappy out. Who's gonna see you without your makeup on? My fans... Both of them. (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) We got a weather problem. Radar says there's a bigger storm front coming in from the West. We gotta go. It's New Year's Eve. This sucks. Sorry, man. I won't take it up in this. We'll just have to wait awhile. New Year's in Alabama. Fantastic. Champagne and grits. What's wrong with that? Excuse me, Rick? Hi, how you doing? I heard maybe you'd be stuck cause of the weather. And I remembered from the show that you love burgers. That was 30 years ago, but I still love burgers. I made some. Homemade onion rings too. Oh, thanks. Homemade rings? I hate those frozen jobs. They taste like crispy rings. You were at the show last night. I'm Donna. I'm a fan from way back. That's the only kind of fans I got. Oh no, there were a lot of younger people in the audience at PJ's. No, they were just audience members, not real fans. Have we met before? No, but I feel like I know you. (Bobby laughs) Sorry, just a couple of things somebody always says to Rick. And I'm always glad to hear them. I kept a scrapbook of you. Really? Would you like to see it? You started way back, didn't you? Once upon a time in TV Land, there lived a handsome young prince. (bright music) It's The Ozzie and Harriet Show." Starring, Ozzie. Harriet. David. And Ricky. Here they are, your favorite family, the Nelsons. See, Thorny didn't have the lawnmower. He'd lent it to Joe. So well, Thorny couldn't have known it fell off the truck. Well how'd he expect you to know that? No, I didn't know it either. And don't look at me, I try and stay as far away from lawnmowers as I can. We noticed that. (audience laughs) That might be tougher now. Why is that, dear? Excuse me, son. (audience laughs) You didn't? Yep, he did. I suppose the grass may be a greener in someone else's yard, but it'll be shorter in ours. (all laugh) And cut. Rick? (voices chattering) Hey, those are great flowers. Thanks, brought 'em for you. Hey, Rick. Hey, how are you? Great. Good. Ricky, I thought we agreed, you were going to get a haircut? I did Pop. I got a crew cut. It's the longest crew cut I've ever seen. Looks like a ducktail and side burns to me. Come here, take a look in the mirror. Take a good look. I told you Pop. I got a crew cut. No, look deeper. Who's that on the boom? Joe Vankay. Joe Vankay. How many kids does Joe have? Well, probably none. You never let him go home. Three. Charlene, four. John Emerson has three of the most beautiful little girls you'd ever want to meet. We have 45 people working on the set with us here, Ricky. Their livelihoods depend on us. I know, Dad. I know. Anything else? Yeah, now that you mention it. You could wake up a little earlier and you could pay a little bit better attention in school. Can I go now? Yeah. Dad was really steamed. How about an episode called "Dr. Ozzie's Monster?" Dad plays Dr. Frankenstein. When he turns electricity on my hair grows unstoppably. And when he removes the electrodes? I lift them up and snap 'em in half like a pencil. What do you think? Which half would direct the show? (both laugh) Morning, guys. Hey, Pop. Hi, Pop. Glad you cooled down, son. That's me, Mr. Cool. Playing tennis today? Nah, Terry got a new car. Gonna check it out. Oh yeah. What kind of car? A '42 Ford Coupe. A hot rod. You about ready, dear? We're supposed to meet Ron and Nancy at Chasen's at eight. What do you think of this? Ozzie wants Ricky to cut his hair, play more tennis and stop hanging around with his hot-rodding friends. Not juvenile delinquents, just kids who basically respect their parents and happen to like cars. So Ricky wants to go out hot rodding. Instead of playing tennis? Right, now, Ozzie bets Ricky, that he can beat him in tennis. And if Ricky loses, he has to cut his hair. And Ricky wins. No dear, they'll tie. But Oz couldn't tie with Ricky at tennis if he played in a wheelchair. The audience doesn't know that. Besides, Ricky will come to his senses of his own accord and cut his hair. And there's our happy ending. You sure you wouldn't like a martini, dear? You know I don't drink. Well, maybe you should consider starting. (audience cheering) Like that. Do not raise your arm until the bull is into the cage. Again. (bright music) Haha! Very good son, very good. How's he doing, Luis? Ricky he's muey naturale. Best student I ever have. And that's no bull, Dad. So Luis, you think he'll be ready? We're filming the show on Friday. No sweat, when do we get the real bull? Senor McManus studied for five years before he ever set foot in a bull ring, Ricky, You can't seem to stick with anything for more than five days. We shoot a new episode every week. We'll talk about it later. The girls are here from "Teen Time" magazine for your dream dates, remember? Let's go. Ice cream sundaes for breakfast? Not your typical daily fare, but today is anything but typical for the two lucky girls who won the "Teen Tempo" magazine's Dream Date with the Nelson boys. They've got a busy day and night planned in glamorous Hollywood and what a way to start. Mm, this sure is good. Do you come here a lot? Oh, we love C.C. Brown's. It's the best hot fudge in the world. But we're so busy, we can only make it here once a week. And we have sundaes every Saturday. (girls laugh) What are Dave and Rick so busy with? 16 year old Alma Jean Biator of Sandusky, Ohio, and 15 year old Euphemia Wells of Bayside, New York are dying to know. So, it's off to the studio. You're always doing new and interesting things on the show. Isn't it hard to learn so many new skills? Well, I've been doing the show since it started on radio when I was eight. And by now I'm used to doing as much as I can like fencing. Can you teach me something? Sure. Here, hold it like that. Place yourself sideways. Like this? Yeah. Put your arm up. And watch, one, two, three. En garde. En garde. There you go. You can teach me something too, Ricky. Sure. But it isn't all work for the Nelson boys. Their dream dates deserve a tour of the glamorous and exciting town that the lucky Nelsons are happy to call home, where the most famous intersection in the world just happens to be located. After freshening up, the girls are taken to dinner at the world famous, Brown Derby restaurant. Yes, it's good, hearty, American fair for these wholesome kids. And after dinner, it's back to the Hollywood Roosevelt for a few turns on the dance floor. And oh, what a night it's been. but does it end with a good night kiss? I love you. Tell Rick I'm in room 629. Bye bye. Bye. We're the luckiest girls in the whole world. What a great date. Cut. Some dream date. Yeah, I'm outta here. Hey, you're on the cover of "Teen Tempo." Let's buy 'em all and burn 'em. (car honking) Hey, what do we got, Little Ricky? Hey, it's the Rooks. Little Ricky's on "I Love Lucy." I grew up and sold him my name. I don't mess around, boy. You say that every week, huh? It works great with chicks. Yeah. Ozzie and Harriet. It's too funny. Your father's Mr. Clean and your friggin' mother... It's a good punch. I shouldn't have said that about your mother. So you guys wanna hang with us? Yeah, sure. You kidding? Come on. All right. So Rick, you wanna be a Rook, you gotta get that Rook look. What do you think? All right. After you. (bright music) Hi, Mom. Hi, Ricky. What's for dinner? Cut. What is that on your arm? Let me see that. See what, Pop? What is this? That's for my chess club. Oh, Ricky. Why is it there? Because I paid a tattoo artist five bucks. Oh my goodness, you didn't? Yep, I did. (crew gasps) Oh, Ricky, no. I just don't understand you son. It's India ink. It washes off. (crew sighs) Thinks he's funny. A little vim and some cold cream should take care of that. Ricky, did you do your history assignment? No. What about your English essay? No. And may I ask why not? I don't want to. And I don't want you to be my tutor either. You're fired. Ricky. (tutor speaking foreign language) Ozzie. Ozzie! How can he fire his tutor? Where does he get the nerve to do that? He's going through a rebellious stage. It happens to all kids. Look, I was a rebel too. Don't forget. I was a musician, a band leader. You should be glad he shows some spunk. He can show some spunk as long as America can't see it. We've got to keep those boys down to earth. Oh, Oz. It doesn't matter what we do. He's 16 years old. He'll be 17 next month. He's a TV star, makes a hundred thousand dollars a year. That's as much as the President. How do you suggest we get him back in line? I think he needs his own car. A car, Oz? He'll be cruising around all night with his friends. Not if I threaten to take the car away. (bright music) Hey, Dad. You should write an episode about this. (tires squealing) (people yelling) (Harriet gasps) Gee, dear. I think that worked out awfully well. The Porsche flipped. I had some minor injuries. The car had seat belts, but who 'em wore back then? You always were a lucky sumbitch. The man was born under a lucky star. Yeah, I always feel safe when I travel with him. You never lost your interest in cars though, did you? Cars, girls, music. The story of my life. Heck, it was a girl that got me singing.

You know the first record he made was for his mother, in one of those recorder song booths. Like they've gotten Wallack's. No kidding. You think he could wiggle in there? (Lorrie laughs) I don't know. They're open till 10. Do you wanna make a record with me? (Ricky scoffs) I can't sing. Well, you never know until you try. How about J5?

Well, I must admit there's a lot of excitement to it. I guess it's the musical expression of the modern teenager's enthusiasm or something. I'm not gonna knock it, I'll tell you that much. Cut. Beautiful. Beautiful. (bright music) We're just going to cut a couple of tracks to see how you sound with proper accompaniment. Hello, fellas. Hey, Mr. Nelson. This is my son, Ricky. Maybe you've seen him on the show. Hey Ricky. Nice to see you. So far he only sings in the shower and he can't even hit the dry notes. (drum rimshot) Thank you. So take care of him, huh? Sure.

We at the network wanna do a complete slate of interviews. Well, I'll make Ricky available, but only for selected publications. Strike while the iron's hot, Ozzie. And it's burning. Ricky's a phenomenon. We gotta get him on "Bandstand." Gosh, it's exciting, isn't it? Whoever would've expected this? But I'm uncomfortable with that word phenomenon, Leonard. It implies that Ricky's some sort of flash in the pan. I'm sure it'd be great for Dick Clark and you network fellas to have him on "Bandstand." But my concern is for Ricky's long term career. Oh, ours too. Of course. As long as you understand that nobody will be seeing Rick on Ed Sullivan or Steve Allen or "Bandstand." It will however, be a great promotion for the affiliates.

Ricky, I have my own family and we have our own TV show. I can't desert them. Is that enough, Ricky? Oh yeah. That's great. Does everybody have everything they need? Okay, Harriet, Ricky, Lorrie. A toast to David, upon reaching the age of majority, which is what we used to call 21 when I was in law school. But David is a definite minority. He's a great son, a terrific actor. And will one day be a great director. Yeah, if Dad will ever give me a shot. Here, here. And one of the most patient young men I've ever known. (all laugh) To David. To David. Happy birthday, honey.

Ricky, stand up, come here. I wanna show you something. Take a look at this. Holy smokes. It's a gold record. Oh my goodness. To Ricky Nelson to commemorate the sale of over 500,000 copies. Oh, honey, congratulations. That is wonderful. Congratulations, Rick. Thank you, Mr. Chudd. No thank you. You too, Ozzie. You know I've been in the record business a long time. This is the fastest selling gold record I have ever seen, and plenty more to come too. It was already a special occasion. It's just a little more special now. We need a picture. Brad, come in here with your camera. Turn that around. Let's get this. How about let's get the whole family in the photograph, huh? Well, that's a good idea. Everybody gather around. Come on Lorrie. David's special day. Here we go. Everybody gather up. Now tell us when to smile. I'll give you all something to smile about. I'm moving out. All right. Hey Dave, I'm sorry. No, it's not your fault. I'm happy for you. It's just that I'm 21 years old and it's time I got my own place. Make sure there's an extra bedroom for me, you know what's yours is mine. And what's ours is Dad's. See ya. All right. See you later, Rick. Take care. We gotta surround Rick with younger musicians. What about the guys who did the record? Too old for teenagers. He likes these guys that are down the hall. They're working with a country and western singer named Bob Luman. Hillbillies? Not hillbilly, rockabilly. (bright music) Dad, this is James Burton on guitar. James. Nice to meet you. This is Jamie Kirkland on bass. How are you, Jamie? Ricky, sing something for us. No, I can't, not right now. Come on, Rick. How are we gonna gauge the ability of the band? (bright music) Listen to that. These guys are great. Ricky, when I was leading the band with your mom, there were always some great soloists around, just like Jim here. Finding a good accompanist is much tougher. I'll tell you what, can you fellas play me, "Bye Bye Blackbird," in B flat? Yes, sir. But we play it in A major. I guess I can stretch a little bit.

I heard he's very polite. Just be nice to him. See me do that? It's simple, very simple. (Elvis vocalizes) Hey man, it's Ricky Nelson. Ricky Nelson. Mr. Presley. I'm glad to see you. Man, we gotta talk. And you've got to be Lorrie Collins. Honey, I think you're the coolest. Tell your brother I dig his guitar. But I gotta talk to Ricky. Excuse us, will you? Sure. You like the show? Yeah. I can't believe it's really you, man. Rick Nelson, man. Really Ricky Nelson. How's your Mom and your Dad? Fine. Just fine. I feel like I know y'all. I'm a big fan.

I gotta go on tour in three days and when I get back, you're gonna be on the road. Ricky, all my family has is cause of me and Larry singing. Jimmy, you know my manager? He set this whole tour up.

It's a Western called "Rio Bravo," with Howard Hawks directing. He's even better than I am. (Ozzie laughs) Anyway, you're gonna play a character named "Colorado" and you get to sing a song, son. I made darn sure of that. That's just great. There's just one thing. What's that? Do you know any stars that live with their parents? No. Neither do I. I'm moving out. (thunder rumbling) Hey, Victor?

Tell me about it. I couldn't stand having to show some face to the world. When I'm with you I don't have to. Well, when you get down to who you really are, babe, you can show the world any damn thing you want. (both laugh) We come from totally opposite places in life and we connect where it's just right. It's not where you come from. It's where you're going. Ooh. Progress. Cool. Can I get your autograph? Sure. (voices chattering) (gentle music) (car horn honking) It's gonna be okay, just a few more hours. Yeah, how the hell would you know? I ask people. Yeah, well ask me. I've tried this before. I can get you into a hospital. I'll pay for it. I wanna take care of you. Hospitals are sewers. Damn it, I like being a junkie. (Suzanne cries) I love these scenes. It brings out the best in people. So much care, man. I wish I could shoot up all the concern right into my heart. I love you, Suzanne. Well, we all make mistakes. It's no mistake. Can you get me a root beer? Warm root beer. I don't want cold. Sure. Promise me you'll be here when I get back. Promise me. Oh, promise me. I'm not going anywhere. (both scream) Son of a bitch. I gotta kill him. What the hell happened? Son of a bitch tried to kill Ricky. He tried to kill me. Hot damn. Where's my root beer? Come on, let's hit it. We gotta get your ass outta here. Come on. (knuckles rapping) Come in. Hello, Suzanne. Come on in. Have a seat. Look, I don't know what this is about. But I love Rick and he loves me. I don't know why, but he does. Well, I can see why. You're pert, bright, attractive, but you're a junkie, honey. Who told you that? There are people who make it a business to find out these things. I can't allow it. I run a business here. Rick is the biggest attraction in the country. I thought it was a family. As well as being my son. I have to protect him in both areas. I make him happy, you know? I inspire him. I let him be himself. He's perfectly capable of being himself. Well, you've never seen it. You've been on his ass since the day he was born. I'd like to see you get some help with your problems. I'd like it to be in another state. I'm doing this because I love him. (Ozzie sighs) (bright music) And action. Oh, hi Ricky. Hi, Mom. What's for dinner? Oh, hi Ricky. Hi, Mom. Have you seen Dave? Oh, hi Ricky. Hi, Mom. What's that out on the lawn? Oh, hi Ricky. Oh, hi Ricky. Hi Mom. Hi, Mom. Who parked the hearse out in the driveway? Cut. Is there a reason you muffed the line son? It's not a hearse. It's a Model T. Let's try it again. Why don't we just do it in two weeks when we actually shoot that episode? Oz, 20 times up and down those damn stairs, I don't think my legs can take it anymore. Rick, honey, is something bothering you? I gotta talk to you. All right, son. All right, take five everybody. Smoke 'em if you got 'em. Let's go to my office. (bell rings) Now, what is it you want? Do you know where Suzanne is? Why is she missing or something? I've searched all over. I haven't heard from her and I'm really worried. Oh, dear. I'm sure she's all right. She just seems a little bit... Oh, I don't know a little flighty. She's not flighty. She's just not brainwashed. Son, I know you're upset, but that's no way to talk to your... Ozzie. Ricky, we know you love Suzanne, dear. We wanna help you find her. How long has it been since you've heard from her? Five days. Five days, maybe she took a little vacation? She doesn't go on vacations, Dad. She's gone. She's missing. Nobody's seen her or heard from her. Oz, isn't there something we can do? Remember that fella Al Miller we met at Moso's? Wasn't he a private investigator? Mm-hmm. If it's this serious, Ricky, I'll try to find his card and I'll give him a call. All right? Yeah. Now tick tock, let's get back to work, huh? Back to work? You don't get it. You can't get it. It's just the girl I love that's missing. Not somebody important like one of your cameramen. I'm gonna go find her myself. And at the end of the season, I'm quitting the show. It's not that simple. You graduate high school or college, the school goes on. But if you leave this show son, we are all out the door. I know you're feeling restless and upset, but you're the biggest ratings draw this network has. They basically told me that if you leave, the show gets canceled. You think I'm going to have the show canceled for one missing girl? Come on, dear. (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) Did you ever hear from Suzanne again? When's this damn plane gonna be ready? I'm tired of this nostalgia crap. I looked for her for years. I never saw her again. (bright music) Who is that? It's Kris Harmon. Little Kris Harmon?

When there was 10,000 chicks a night throwing themselves at me, I just wanted you. (Kris laughs) I never told you this, but since I was 10, I kept your picture on my wall. And underneath it I wrote, "Nothing's impossible." And I just kept waiting and hoping and dreaming of... I don't know what. I wanted to get married some day, sure. But I was dreaming, just that you'd call. I'll write a song called, "I Just Wanted You." I hope you got what you wanted. Oh, yeah. Action. Mm. It's delicious, honey. I don't believe you. You think I can't cook? Cut. June, that's not what's written in the script. Yes, I know. I know, but it just felt more natural to say, "I don't believe you," rather than to say you hate it. (crew laughs) I'm a good cook and I'd never cook anything my husband would hate. She's got good instincts, Dad. Please, June, just read the lines as written. I'm sure you're a very good cook in real life, but this is television. As if he'd know the difference. (voices chattering) Okay, everybody. Why don't we take five and set up for the restaurant. (bell rings) Oh, great. Take a look at Kris. Uh-oh. Now, honey, just take it easy on her. What happened to June? What happened to your hair? I cut it. Do you like it? Well, it could be a problem. You hate it, don't you? It's not that dear. It's just that we haven't finished the scene we started yesterday and now your hair doesn't match. I'm sorry. Oh, I'm so stupid. It's okay. We'll get you a wig. I'll never do it again, I promise. Oh, we know that dear. It was so much easier when we just had the boys. Is she gaining weight? Maybe Kris wasn't the good little Catholic girl we thought she was. (tense music) The show is very vulnerable with the network and you know the ratings are down. I think our fans that do tune in deserve a high moral standard from the Nelsons. I really don't think we have a choice here, Ricky. What's the big powwow about? We gotta put the baby in an incubator. That's only for sick or premature babies. Look at her. She's perfect. I know, but we just gotta pretend she's premature, you know, for public relations reasons? People counting back to the day of the wedding. That's ridiculous. You're 23 years old. She's your daughter Our daughter. Why do we have to do everything your Dad tells us to? Sure, it's crock. I hate it too, but Dad's really under the gun from ABC. How long does she have to be in there for? Five days. I can't see her for five days? Can we visit her in the nursery? Of course you can, baby. Of course you can. (baby fussing) You're the best, Kris. I promise I'll make it up to you, honey. Rick, I changed my mind. I want my baby back. Calm down. Rick, go get her. Go get her! Honey, calm down. Nurse? What's the matter? Mrs. Nelson! You've gotta get back into bed. I want my baby back! Your baby's fine, just fine. I want my baby. Well, we finally got a little girl in the family. She is about six weeks premature. Four pounds, seven ounces. Small, but gorgeous. She's perfectly healthy, but just as a precaution, we've got her in an incubator for a couple of days. So if you wanna hold her, you have to pick up the whole machine. (Harriet laughs) (bright music) (voices chattering) Gather around everybody. Come close. I'm not going to say, "Good morning," because it isn't. (Ozzie laughs) We've all become like one big happy family around here. So I'm going to tell you all at the same time, not Harriet and the boys first, but everybody. "All good things must come to an end," they say. After 14 years we've been canceled. ABC's not renewing the show. For 14 years, you all have made our lives great and made the show great and you've... Made you a lot of money. (all laugh) That too. Well, just working with you all has... Watching your kids grow up, watching our kids grow up, Ricky and David, it's just made Harriet and I feel part of something bigger than all of us. What's next, Oz? Oh, I'll probably get a Beatles haircut and go on the road with the band. What do you say, honey? (all laugh) Well, all right, we've got three more shows. Chop, chop, back to work. Ricky, David, on the couch. Okay, last show folks. Let's make it count. Scene 22, take one, mark it. (bright music) ♪ Oh whenever you get lonely ♪ ♪ And you can't find your way home ♪ ♪ You can ride my heart you can ride my heart ♪ ♪ Out across the sky of night ♪ ♪ Beyond the mood in the cloudless light ♪ ♪ You can call it love ♪ You can hold... What happened? Fell off the table, man. That was great guys. Now let's do it again. And Rick remember, don't sing more than four bars under a single breath. A singer's gotta have technique. All right, guys. Let's just take a little break. Oh, that was great! I just got chills listening to you, and seeing you with your eyes closed like that, it's gonna be a great record. I've got great news too. Ta-da! What is it? It's a movie script, "Love and Kisses." Your Dad wrote it and it's fabulous. It's not "Ben Hur," honey, but it's got its charms. It's a romantic comedy about a young couple who are totally in love. And they get married on the day of their high school graduation. They can't wait, but they can't afford to get their own place, so they move into his parents' house. You gotta be kidding me, right? Let me guess who the parents are. You will be wrong. Mom and me are not going to play the parents. But you and I are gonna be the couple. Isn't that fantastic? Thinking about Jack Kelly, you know, "Barton Maverick," to play the dad. Who's gonna direct it? The script's garbage. It's like a bad episode of the show. It's not that bad is it? No, it's worse. I know Dad's been climbing the walls since the show's been over and he doesn't know what to do with himself, but this? I'm not doing it. Oh, but I wanna be in the movies. My mom was a movie star. My dad was a football star. You're a star. Everybody but me. Come on. We'll have fun. I'm 25 years old, I can't play a high school kid anymore. It's only 17 shooting days. You can do that for me for 17 days, can't you? Then I can become a movie star. Oh, please, honey. Please. I'm not doing that scene with the giant stuffed lion, no way. Yes! (gentle music) Let's give a 1966 American Hardware Association welcome to someone we all know and love. We remember him growing up on "The Ozzie and Harriet Show." We danced to his records at our high school sock hops. Well, he's here tonight with his latest musical offerings. Ladies and gentlemen, Ricky Nelson. (audience clapping) (audience cheering) It's Rick now, not Ricky. Go to hell, you hippie scumbag. (audience booing) Get a haircut! (voices chattering) Play, "Mary Lou!" (girls screaming) Hey, man. Are you okay? Sing. ♪ Pale dawn a misty river ♪ Go home! Go home, hippie! (audience booing) (audience yelling) ♪ Whenever you like ♪ (audience cheering) What are you writing? I'll show it to you when I'm done. Is it about me? Kris. Oh, what do I have to do to get you to make it about me? I'm in a groove. I'm trying to concentrate. We got kids. Bills to pay. Maybe if you left a little undecorated space in this house and a few dollars in the accounts. We can't be overdrawn. You still have checks left. Kris, please. Just be loving and support you. That's what you say you want. Well, I'm trying while you're down in this room day and night. You hold your guitars more than you hold me. I gotta work. I gotta get something going. The Stones, The Beatles and The Moody Blues, they got the rock field way too crowded. I gotta find something that'll get me an audience. Hmm. And you just wanna get laid. If that's what I wanted, believe me, I could get it, no problem. Son of a bitch! (wood thuds) (Kris sobs) Look when I'm on the road, I can't know how much there is in the accounts. You're not on the road now. And if you were on the road, you'd be making money and we wouldn't have this problem. No, no. That's not exactly correct. Even though you did 17 engagements last May, I believe that your musical company is in the red by approximately $16,000. You mean he was losing a thousand dollars a show? Close to it. So I can save money by not working. You have to cut down on your expenditures. You're monthly nut is way too high. I'm not the one who's spending it. I don't go out. I don't even carry money. You have three kids, two nannies, two gardeners, four cars. And a wife with spending disease. We didn't need another car or Valentine's day party or to redecorate the kitchen. What about that private eye you've you've been paying to look up your old junkie girlfriend? Yeah, I've known about it for years. What do we do now, Dan? I think you have to decide whether you want to borrow or declare personal bankruptcy. (gentle music) Rick? Hey, man. What's with the coat? I'm cold. It's the summer, Rick. What are you doing here? Kris called me. Dan Cohen called, they're worried about you. You wanna go out? You wanna catch a Dodgers game or something? Get outta the house. Kris says you've been living like a hermit. Like Herman's Hermits. I wonder how they're doing. They haven't had a hit in a while either. Why don't you stop wallowing? I mean, it's okay for a while, but you have a wife and three kids and you're broke. Hey, we still got that shopping center that Dad invested us in up north. We sold that a year ago, Rick. Lend me some money. Yeah, I don't know what to do. I gotta go, Ozzie's here. So he sees him. What do I care? Let him know the truth. Boo. Hello, Kris. Hi. Gosh. Just wonderful stuff. Thank you. How are you doing? Keeping busy. You know me. Where's Ricky, honey? Is he around? He should be up. Yeah, he should be up. It's four o'clock in the afternoon. (Ozzie laughs) You'll find him in the closet in the master bedroom. In the closet? (knuckles rapping) Rick? Are you in there, son? Rick? Hi, Pop. Well, Kris said you were in the closet. When I was getting dressed. Oh. Gosh, you look great, son. Don't act so surprised. What's up? Well, it's the darndest thing. ABC asked for another show and I've come up with this great idea for you and Dave... Dad, dad. Hear me out, son. Just hear me out. You and David would play brothers of course. And you'd both be lawyers who work together. The storylines would center around these two lawyer brothers and their wives, and their families, and some of the staff that work at the office. What do you think? I don't think I'm the lawyer type. You don't have to be son. It'll be written for you, tailored to your style. Irrepressible Ricky. I'm not an actor, Dad. I hated doing the show. I never wanna act again ever, especially for you. You're not a writer. You're like a damn machine, like something out of a sausage factory. You just kept pushing it and pushing it. I don't want you to write for me for my style. I don't have a style. I'm a singer. I'm a musician. That's what I love. Ozzie and Harriet's been off the air for three years now, Dad. When are you gonna give up the Goddamn ghost? It's over. Counting radio, I put in 18 years with the show. I worked 70 hours a week. It made us financially secure, famous, and gave you a hell of a head start in the world. In all of that time, I never so much as asked for a thank you. You didn't do it for me or for Dave, or for the 47 technicians. You did it for yourself. Well, I'll just say goodbye to Kris and the kids. (rain pattering) (thunder rumbling) I don't have much here on the next few years. Me neither. We were just another young All-American drugged out couple, especially in Hollywood, you know the music business? I got nothing to hide. I was a total waste, a basket case. ♪ Every day with you is filled with cinnamon and coffee ♪ ♪ As we watch the crystal pendulum go round ♪ Well, it's not rock. It's not folk. It's kind of a mishmash, isn't it? I think you can do better, Rick. It's just an experiment. Experiment, yeah. You know, I've got this young producer, John Boylan. He's got a great ear, good taste. How would you feel about working with him for a while? He'd love to work with you. I'm not interested. I mean, this guy is a has been. He's a plastic TV idol, man. Come on, come on, come on. Just give him a couple of weeks, huh? I mean, if nothing happens then it's, "Bye, bye, Ricky." What do you say? (gentle music) No. Okay, Rick, try it like this. (bright music) Randy, man. Good show at the Troubador. Thank you, sir. Meet Rick Nelson. I love Poco, man. No kidding? Thanks, man. I can't believe it, I'm meeting Rick Nelson.
