THE FLIRTATION OF GIRLS Prance and sway, my mare. Dance with the brides of the night. Prance and sway with us. Let the whole world swing with us. Let our lovers give chase to us, night and day, and day and night. We are the youth of light and flowers, we bring joy to this world. Lucky is the one we alight on. Night and day, and day and night. Hurry my mare, time stole up on us. It envies us and envies our lovers. Hurry before the light steals away. Night and day, and day and night. Life, rush forward as you carry us, but don't you fly away and leave us behind. Yasine. Hello, mister Marzouk. - Where's the basha? - Outside. Get me an aspirin. Ibrahim. An aspirin. What happened? A disaster. A calamity. Dear me. What happened? What is it? Leila, the basha's daughter. What happened? She fell. Fell? Where? - From a ladder? - From a window? - From a car? - From a horse? She fell in her exam. - She flunked? - Yes. God give us strength. Poor Leila. All those sleepless nights for naught. She wasn't studying during those nights. She was playing, and dancing, and singing, and riding horses. We're done for. Why are you so upset? - The fisherman threw his net... - And caught a frog instead. Fish? Frogs? What is this? You are making a big deal out of nothing. Pass or fail, what difference does it make? Does she need to get a job? A profession? - She will never change. - No need to bother about it. Great. Since it is not a big deal, you go tell him. - Me? - Certainly. You're very close. You've been his butler for 40 years. Your face soothes him. He almost broke my face with a glass yesterday when I told him his candidate lost the election. Then you must do it. You keep me out of this. You're miss Leila's governess. He only drinks coffee if you've made it. You must tell him the news. Me? Why? - Does a man run away... - and hide behind a woman? Fine. I'll tell him, god help me. You must. You're his secretary. You must bear the brunt. You're well paid for it. Your day is not looking good. You're having a bad one. He's going to give you a thrashing. Good morning, sir. - I bring news that... - What? Bad news? Yes, slightly bad. Then keep it to yourself, unless you want me to break your neck. Very well, sir. Where you are going? I'm up here. What is this about? - The young miss. - Leila? Yes. - What happened? - She flunked. You black crow. - Indeed, sir. - What did she flunk? - Arabic. - May god damn you. A curse upon you. Have mercy, sir. I did not write the exam. God help you when I come down this tree. She failed in Arabic. Arabic. How nice. Arabic, you say? Failed in Arabic? She can take the exam again. She shall pass. Why would she pass? A little patience, sir. Patience, you say? Here, tell me. - How's your health today? - God give me strength. Why do ask about my health? Sir, I know an Arabic teacher, one of the best. An exemplary educator. His name is Hamam (pigeon). - Hamam? - Yes sir. If you hire him for one month, she won't only pass Arabic. She shall drink in Arabic, and eat in Arabic, and sleep in Arabic, even sneeze in Arabic. Very good. You may not return before you hire this mister Rooster. Hamam, sir. Pigeon, rooster, duck. Who cares? Am I going to eat him? Go and get him. I'll be up the tree. Either this one, or that one. THE FOX AND THE LION. Settle down. Go on. The fox was staggering down the road. No. Read it again. The fox was... The fox was swaggering down the road. Yes. Swagger, not stagger. To stagger is to hesitate. To swagger is to walk with pride, like someone very pleased with himself. Understood? Yes. Puffed up like a peacock. Right. Puffed up. Though "puffed up" is how a line cook would put it. You are all making me puff. Sit. You read. The lion was... The lion was engaged. The lion was engaged. - Engaged? - That's what it says. Engaged? How? A lion got engaged? Is this a romantic lion? The lion was enraged. Enraged. Meaning he was about to explode. Quiet. Are you laughing at your ignorance? He's right. You have no manners. Unacceptable. Please, sir, sit down. No. You're not my advocate. You have no manners. - Sit. - But... Yes sir. The lion was enraged, and he said... and he said... - Sir. - What? Can lions talk? The ministry of education taught him how to talk. This lion can speak. Sit. Fine. Let him speak. The lion was enraged, and he said, you afternoon. Afternoon? He called him afternoon? - That's what is says. - Silly girl. Buffoon, not afternoon. As in stupid, dumb, ridiculous, not morning, noon, and afternoon. Sit. Afternoon. You. The lion was enraged, and he said, you buffoon, you're forward. Shut up, or I'll break your bones. Forward? Forewarned. As in the fox is going to have a very bad day, just like my day. What's this? The principal dropped it off. He did? What for? - Good morning. - All rise. Sit down. Mister Hamam. I can hear the commotion from my office. This is unacceptable. Be patient, mister principal. They can barely speak Arabic. They're like foreigners. I need results. Continue the lesson. Certainly. Continue. Mister Hamam. What's this? You gave it to me, sir. Me? Why? Because I love you so much? The girls said so. You're all suspended for 3 days. The culprit will be further punished. It's always like this. Yesterday, they dropped a rubber mouse in my pocket. That's because you have no self-respect. You're a joke. You're not worthy of this school. You're fired. It's over. - But sir. - Enough. Are you happy now? I'm done for. I'll be homeless. Satisfied? What a shame. Shame? Shame on you. God give me strength. May god damn... He only damned me. God forgive you. Mister Hamam. Your salary is 600 cents. Here's 200 for the week. - Excluding expenses, you get 25 cents. - Thank you. - But, if I... - Goodbye. - But... - Thanks. - I... - Have a good day. Yes, very good. Happiest day of my life. - What awful news, mister Hamam. - It's OK. This has affected me a lot. - I could almost cry. - Thank you. You owe me 22 cents for cigarettes. I see. Here's 25. Don't you worry. You'll be fine. Bye. Where's my change? I don't have it. Bye. Mister Hamam. Good thing I found you. Look now. I need... What do you need? I have no money. Who cares? Come with me. Let me be. - What is it? - I was fired. Why? So that I live in misery. So that I lose peace of mind. - I have bad luck. - Luck? An educated man like you, speaking of luck? How could I not believe in it? Stop this nonsense. It's not nonsense. I was born under a bad star. A few days ago, I wanted to eat fish. I went to the fish market, and looked at thousands of fish, then I chose one I liked. You're an expert in fish. Very much. I baked it, and ate it. - Very good. - Not good at all. - What happened? - Food poisoning. Really? Did you hear about the diseased fish? I read about it in the newspaper. The very first fish to get ill was the one I chose. All the others were healthy. - Mister Marzouk. - What? I'm a little nervous. Why? What should I say to the basha? Don't worry. I've never talked to a basha before. Don't be silly. Our basha is very reasonable. - Thank god. - Come. And his daughter, Jamila... Her name is Leila, not Jamila. Sit here. The basha will come soon. Welcome. Hello, sir. - Please sit. - Thank you, sir. How do you like it? - Like what? - Coffee. Coffee? Mister basha, I... Basha? Me? I just serve coffee. - Just the coffee? - Yes. A pleasure. Would you like a little sugar, or a lot of sugar? Sugar is expensive, so I usually don't take any. Add as much sugar as you can. Very well. All this pomp just to serve coffee? What do their basha look like then? Execute these orders to the letter, or you're done for. Water temperature must be precisely 38.5 degrees. Get it wrong, and you're in jeopardy. Get this prescription immediately. You have 5 minutes to do it. Please sit. I had forgotten the prescription. I have so many things on my mind. His illness has worried us so much. Too bad. The basha's son? The basha's son? No, the dog. Him? I'm so sorry. I did notice that he was pale. He looks much better now. He did not eat for 4 whole days. Poor thing. Still... Some people do not eat for 7 days. True, but they don't have his delicate constitution. True, he is very delicate, basha. Basha? I'm not the basha. I work for him. You work for him? I take care of the dog. Your job is to take care of the dog? Yes. - That's all? - Yes. - So you're the dog's... - Yes. A pleasure to meet you. Same here. And they pay you? - 30 pounds. - That's all? Yes. That's unfair. It's not enough. You should protest. Ask for a raise. I should. 30 pounds is nothing. I feed him, and bathe him, and educate him. I'm like a teacher. Teachers don't get 30 pounds. What do you do? I'm into books. An educator. - That's all? - Yes. Very nice to meet you. Excuse me. Very nice. 30 pounds. I should have taught dogs instead. I'd be rich by now. I'll look in the living room. What's this now? - Excuse me. - Yes? - Can you please? - Please what? Stand up. Move it. Strange. Have you been here long? 15 minutes. Did you see anything? - Like what? - A diamond bracelet. Not even a lead bracelet. I've seen nothing. - Think hard. Maybe... - Maybe what? Maybe you forgot. I did not forget anything. Then where is it? How should I know? - Who do you want? - They want me. - What for? - To teach Arabic. - To whom? - The basha's daughter. You, teach her? Yes. Why not? What's the big deal? She's just a dumb girl who flunked. I'll make her a little less stupid. - You'll do this? - Yes. She's the one who will sort you out, and teach you a lesson. Are you sound of mind? More or less. She's going to drive you crazy. She will make you a madman. You, teach the basha's daughter? They chose well indeed. A bald man is here to comb the hair of the sultan's daughter. Bald man? Sultan? Diamond bracelet? This girl... What's this? - You there. - What do you want? - Stand up. - Stand up? I said stand up. Fine. Take it easy. You lost something too? Ruby earrings perhaps? - Ruby? Are you crazy? - Crazy? - Who are you? - The sultan's teacher. I mean the basha's daughter. - Are you the new teacher? - Yes, that's me. You think you can manage that job? Are you an expert in Arabic grammar? In the tenets of the language? And are you an expert in cucumbers and apple trees? You're a very insolent man. And you look like trash. - Answer my questions. - Why should I? Who are you? You don't look like an educated man at all. You look like you belong with bananas and grapes. Impolite man. - You're crazy. - Mister Marzouk. Come here. Where did you get this donkey from? Shut up, you mule. - Shut up. - Didn't you hear him? Shut your mouth. Sorry, basha. Throw him out. You little ruffian. That's the basha? Who else, you fool? - Couldn't you tell? - He does not look it. The dog walker looked more like a basha. What a shame. Should I leave? Goodbye. - Marzouk. - Yes, sir? Hold that man. His life is over. He is done. What have you done, you fool? Do you want to sleep in jail? Or do you want to go home? - Home, of course. - Very well. - Give it back. - Give what back? The bracelet. What is wrong with you people? Don't give me this talk. You're driving me me insane. Me? A thief? I'm not saying you stole it. Maybe you took it accidentally. What is she talking about? Here. Look. It would fall out. Here. Search my clothes. When will this day end? Woe is me. - Daddy. - What? - I found it. - Leila, really. Couldn't you have been more careful? Careful? Why? So that I don't get humiliated? So I get peace? No. - We are sorry. - Really, you're sorry? You ruin my reputation, and then you're sorry. What shall I do? Kiss your feet? I want nothing. I just want to leave. Fine. You may go. I said I am sorry. If you're not satisfied, I don't care. Marzouk, give him something. I don't want your money. Very well. Don't give him anything. Marzouk, come with me. Marzouk, give him something. Marzouk. Oh, Marzouk. This is the worst day of my life. Will I ever get a break? You're being hard on life, mister. I want to pulverize life. I want to crush it, like it crushed me. Everyone has it easy: People on the street, people in this house... - So life has singled you out? - Indeed it has. I'm like a small fish in the ocean, being attacked by bigger fish. I thought this would work, but I'm cursed. - Cursed? - Yes, cursed. If only I could die. Mister, I am very sorry. Forgive me. I caused all this. I'm so embarrassed. Don't worry about it. This always happens to me. It was bound to happen. Story of my life. Disasters seek me out, like a lover seeking his beloved. The day I was born, there was an earthquake. The first pound I ever earned was counterfeit. I wronged you, and I must now help you, even though we got off on the wrong foot. I'm sorry we have. I personally think you are a nice person. Thank you. Now smile. Smile, please. I will. Now then... Dad's back. I apologize, sir. I hope you are not upset. I am not. What is this? You, still here? What is the meaning of this? Dad, I will explain. We wronged him. Please, daddy. But he's awful. Please, daddy, for my sake. Can't you see his sorry appearance and his shoddy clothes? Mister, don't you have newer clothes? I could borrow some. But what do clothes have to do with this? Am I a teacher or a groom? You hear this? He has a point, dad. Should I see this face every morning then? Look at his beard, like a spider's nest. - He can shave it. - No. You must. Would you let me be? You shall shave it. Bathe him, shave him, and get him a room. - Yes sir. - We'll see. I'll show him. Leila. Prepare your books. You must pass your exam. From now on, you shall... sneeze in Arabic. A-B-C-D, we have the most handsome Arabic teacher. Mister Hamam, we are the nightingales. We have no wings, but we fly all the same. We might misbehave, but we mean well. When we say no, we really mean yes. They're, their, or there. Why should we care? Forget about irregular verbs. A stare from us will set them straight. Who cares about the past tense? The past is past and gone. Let's live in the present and its joys. Our hearts are young and hopeful. We want to laugh and smile. If your father were to stop by and see this scene, I'll be in the past tense as well. Instead of money, I'll get the boot. Very nice. But now, please ask your friends to go. Yes, sir. Fifi, you go now. We'll play cards later. I won't let you win this time. - OK. - Au revoir. Now then. How much of the curriculum have you covered? All of it. I've memorized all of it. I don't know what got into me during the exam. It happens. Nerves, stress... It wasn't that. The examiners looked so stern. Their countenance was not encouraging. Should they hire dancers and singers to examine you? No, but a nice face would help. Someone like you for example. With your kind heart, and sense of humor. If you were my examiner, I would have got an A. I see. Tell me. Do you know "Kana and her sisters"? Of course I do. Even kids know them. But tell me. Are you married? - I... - Single? Yes. Why? Let's focus. The irregular verbs? Let's focus on that. Yes. Go ahead. Kana (to be). Or not to be... That's from a play. That's not grammar. Please concentrate. Kana (to be). Kana. Asbaha (become). Adha (become). Amsa (become). Bata (become). Thala (remain). Ma Zaala (still). Ma bareha (still). Ma fatiaa (still). Ma nfakka (still). Tell me, sir. What does "ma nfaka" mean? Can I say... He 'ma nfakka' his jacket's buttons? No. What jacket? 'Ma nfakka' does not mean to untangle. Here's an example: "And Zeid still walked". It means Zeid kept walking until his feet got sore. "And Omar still ate". It means he ate so much, he ate the whole plate, then the whole pot. You explain so well. It's all so clear. Now I understand. And Sousou still loves Fifi. That's possible. But couldn't Sousou love his brother instead? That would be much better. Can I say, for example, "Leila still..." "likes..." How nice. You look quite presentable, mister Rooster. Hamam, sir. Rooster, pigeon. All the same. You look decent. What are you studying? - Kana and her sisters. - Really? I learned those when I was a toddler. Asbaha (became). Ma Zala (still). Ma nfakka (still). Ma fatiaa (still). Ma nhalla (?). Nhalla who? Ma nhalla. Never heard of it? She is no sister of Kana. They're not even cousins. Marzouk. What is this ignorant man saying? Did you say ma nhalla? - Yes. - Oh yes, of course. Then why did you deny it? She is one of Kana's sisters, but from another father. Very funny. Very funny. How much did we agree on? 700 cents. 700? That's nothing. I'll give you 15 pounds. Marzouk. His salary is 15 pounds. May God give you long life. "Ma nhalla", got it? Absolutely. The most famous of the sisters. - Are you mocking me? - Forgive me. - I didn't mean it. - Carry on. She must pass. - Got it, mister Rooster? - Hamam, sir. Roosters, pigeons. It all tastes great. Come with me. Sir... You're so funny and witty. I feel I'm going to like you very much. Very much. Miss Leila. Telephone from miss Samira. Did you say Samira? Is she back? Excuse me a minute, sir. You're so funny and witty. I feel I'm going to like you very much. Very much. Anwar? Are you back, my love? Tell me, did you miss me? Shame on you. I'm busy right now. I have a lesson. Arabic grammar. I loved, I love, I will love you. I should, shall, and must call you tonight. I love you. Good morning. Hello, mam. Good morning. I'm ready. Please come in. - May I? - Yes. You look so nice. It's not much. I'm trying no to disappoint you, mam. - Listen. - Yes. Please don't call me 'mam'. I'm your student, Leila. You've had students before, right? Then it's settled. Just call me Leila. In this case, just call me Hamam. Sit by me, Hamam. - Are you happy? - And how? This is heavenly. Your comfort means a lot to me. How about food? It's great. Your cook made me two pigeons, and told me, Here, eat yourself. Did you eat here? - No, I ate in the kitchen. - The kitchen? The kitchen? Yes, they were very kind. They were rude. From now on, you'll eat with us, me, you, and father. This is your house now. I'll make sure of it. Mam, I... I am not worthy of your attention. I'm overwhelmed. Don't be silly. You don't realize how much you mean to me. Change your outlook. Look on life kindly. Love life, and it will love you back. You're right. Life and I have been adversaries for a long time. It seems we're getting reconciled. I've started to appreciate it. I'm seeing its beauty. I'm seeing its delights. Life is a song. Its tune is delightful. We sing it as we fly in the sky. Life is an unfinished sentence. We must find the right words to give it meaning. How can people say that life is sad? It gives us magic in many shapes and colors. These blossoms are a balm to sour eyes. In these roses flows the blood of two hearts. This life was made for two. One is here, but where is the other? You who says 'woe is me', all my woe is from you. Your heart holds the cure to my pain. You who is searching for someone, look, he's sitting by you. You'll hear a song, a delightful tune. We sing it as we fly. I'll say a word, you'll say a word, and life's sentences will be complete. What's wrong? Girls, my teacher is tired. You go. Call me later. What delightful words. You're so emotional. Emotional, yes. So many emotions are awake in me. In any case. Let's do some reading. What a shame. We were having fun. The mood is ruined. The mood will be really ruined if you fail again. You only have one more chance. Here. Please read. Weatherly Love. Weatherly? What? Sure. Never heard of weather? I've heard of weather. But it is out of context here. It can't be 'Weatherly'. It must be 'Motherly'. You're right. I envy you. - What for? - You're so smart. It's obvious. This is not a meteorology book. It's an Arabic book. As she parted with her child, the mother said... My love... Is that wrong? It is right. My love... I cannot live without you. Don't you know that you are everything to me? It pains me when I look around, and I can't find you. I miss you dearly. My love... You are the light of my life. - No, you are... - I'm what? You're... You're not reading well. Let's stop. But why? - We must study. - Forgive me. I don't feel well. My god. Anwar? How are you, my love? Busy? No. I'm busy thinking about you. The Arabic teacher? He's a funny one. Father insists I must pass. Your love is the only subject I want to study, it's the only degree I seek. I love you. Love is sweet for those who taste it. It has a thousand signs. I know them all. Romeo and Juliette. Its light caresses eyelids, and wakes them from deepest slumber. It breaks into souls, and makes them soar around the earth. My heart rejoices when the loved one sits by my side. My sweet dreams sway gently to the beat of his heart, and the beat of mine. And if my loved one is ever late, then doubts and worries gnaw on me. He whose heart belongs to another... his agony is repose, and his repose is agony. Lucky is the one who has found his loved one. Woe on the one who missed his chance. When we quarrel, I rejoice as I dream of the day we get reconciled. When he makes amends, I lay in fear of the day when we'll disagree again. Who's there? - It's me. - Me who? - Thief. - No, not a thief. It's Hamam. Mister Hamam? What are you doing here? You see... I was hot. I was suffocating, so I went out for air. You scared me. What a strange night. I'm troubled. Like someone cursed me. I'm tossing and turning. My god. What enemy would curse you? You have no enemies. You deserve to toss and turn on a bed of roses, while I sleep on thorns. I was just thinking of you. I wanted to tell you... - What? - Well... I forgot. There's no hurry. Take your time. All the time you need. I will wait forever. I will be here. Even if you never remember, I'll be here for you, waiting. How nice. You're quite poetic tonight. It must be the moon. The moon. It even affects stone, and wood, especially on such a night. In this serene silence, all one needs is... What's this? Climb up. Hurry up. God damn those dogs. What are those vile creatures? That big dog almost bit my foot. I left my shoe in his mouth. - And the other one? - His friend got it. Don't you worry. Come with me. Come. I want to talk to you. Wait. - Where are we? - My bedroom. Bedroom? How can it be? - So what? - What if someone comes? Back to the dogs. Hold on. Wait. Let go of me. Thank god you're here. - I feel strange tonight. - I... - I must leave. - No, stay. I need someone to confide in. - And you... - Yes, me. I'm... I'm doomed. Who's that? Quick. Come with me. Hold on. Don't open the door. I'm not decent. Who did you think it was? Didn't you recognize my footsteps? Did the dogs wake you? No, but I'm tired. Dear me. Did you catch a cold? This cover is too thin. You need a warmer blanket. Where is the blanket? Where are you going? I'm getting you the blanket. It will keep you warm. No, I'm warm enough. Do you need anything? Some tea perhaps? - Yes, get me some. - Of course. God have mercy. - What's that? - That's... That must be Jimmy. Stop it, Jimmy. See? Believe me now? God help you, Jimmy. He sounds hoarse. Does he have a cold too? - The tea, please. - Yes. Right away. Shut up already. What's wrong with you? Come out. Good job, Jimmy. I'm dying. - Did you have to sneeze? - I could not help it. Here comes another one. - Do you have a cold? - Yes. It's cold outside, and I'm barefoot. I must go. - You're leaving barefoot? - Better barefoot than dead. I'll get you something. Let me think. Here. Take these. - Put them on. - These? - Are you bashful? - They would not fit my toe. - Shall I call the cobbler? - No, it's fine. Wait. I'll find you something. Leila. Little Leila. Did she fall asleep? Leila. I got you some aspirin. Why are the lights off? Dear god. Strange. Is the light broken? I'll call the electrician tomorrow. So annoying. Get up. Take your aspirin. Come on. Come on, sweetheart. Come on, don't play with me. What's wrong? I beg you. Stop it. Help. Thief. I'm not a thief. I'm Hamam. What are you doing here? - Calm down. - Calm down? How dare you? I'll ruin you. You're done. Basha! I'll show you. I'll end you. I'll shoot to kill. No mercy. - Daddy. - The basha. - Where are you? - In the bathroom. - You're here? - Basha? What is it? Did you not see someone snooping around? Snooping? No. What? I heard the dogs go 'bow wow'. Right, Marzouk? Yes. Bow wow. Bow wow. Silence. The guard also saw a shadow in the garden. Where's Leila? In the bathroom. - Showering. - Showering? In the middle of the night? Not her, basha. She's bathing Jimmy. Come now, Jimmy. Stop biting my hand. Calm down, Jimmy. Where are you going? Shame on you. You're leaving me? Don't you care about me? Tell me. What's wrong? Did I offend you? You? You could never offend me, even if you killed me. - Really? - Yes. - If I told you to jump in the sea... - I would. I would jump gladly. - But I must leave. - Wait. I'll leave too. - What? - Let's elope. - Elope? - Yes. Meet me tonight in the garden. We'll take the car. Tonight? Tonight at 10:00. Hamam. Where is he? Here I am. We must hurry. - No. - No, you fool? Yes, I am a fool. - Calm down - I changed my mind. We can't do this. - You won't do it? - Never ever. Never ever. I just can't. Impossible. If you don't do it... If you don't do it right away, - I'll ruin you. - Ruin away. I won't do this foolishness. If you don't get in, I'll scream and say you were kidnapping me. Scream all you want. - Really? - Yes. - Daddy. - Quiet. - You'll do it? - Yes. My eye is fluttering, my head is spinning, my mind is about to go. His eye is fluttering, his head is spinning, his mind is about to go. May I have a word? Tell me, my dear. I would like to know where we're going. We're going to the place where lovers meet, the place where we dance and sing and forget our sorrows. I have a feeling... No, never mind. What is it? Don't keep secrets from me. I feel a disaster looming. God help me. An unforeseen disaster. God help me. Hamam, I need something. What? Are you hungry? - Hungry? No. - What then? I want to dance, I want to sing. I want to kiss you, I know not why. God help me. I brought you along so we could share my love and joy. Who else but you can I trust with my happiness and bliss? For your own sake, I would walk through fire. I'd go through hell if that's what you want. For your own sake, I would walk through fire. I'd go through hell if that's what you want. Hands off my fez. Don't worry. She'll return it to you. That's the custom. Here. Should I give her my shoes as well? Come with me. That's the only fez I own. Stop embarrassing me. - Where's mister Anwar? - He's expecting you. Come here. - What is this place? - Calm down. Who is this mister Anwar? Anwar. - Anwar, my love. - Leila. Come. My heart, my soul. I was afraid you'd not come. Nothing could keep me away from you. Do you love me? You're on my mind night and day. You're in my heart, my soul, my eyes, in my textbooks. You're in every letter, in every page. You're in father's face, in my servant's face, In Hamam's face. Pigeon? I object. What would you like? Whiskey? Champagne? Champagne, quick. Cigarette? You see Anwar? If he does not leave her, I'll destroy this whole place. Calm down. He's doing this for you. He's humiliating me. I'll kill him. I'll disfigure them both with acid. Listen to me, you blockhead. Her father is rich. She has money, and jewelry. It will be all yours. Let him work his craft. I don't care. I'm going to kill him. Calm down. See Anwar's new girl? She must be rich, like the ones before her. Poor girl. Some idiot must have brought her to him. Cheers. Get up. - What is this? - Shut up. - But... - No buts. Get up. Sit down, you money chaser. You're insolent. Throw him out. My fez. My fez, you thieves. Police. Shut up. You thieves. Throw him out. Police. - What is it? - Help. - I beg you. - What is it? Are you responsible for law and order? Are you here to preserve safety and honor? - Are you? - I am. In that case... What time is it? All this shouting to ask me what time it is? God help me. Here's the fez. I'm so sorry. It is fine. I'm worried about him. Who is this fellow anyway? I could not come here alone. Was there no one else though? He's so vulgar. He made a scene. Luckily everyone thought it was staged. No cheers, no nothing. Stop it. Waiter. Police. My fez. My fez, you thieves. Out. You thieves. Police. Police. You again? Help me. - What is it? - You see... - You see... - What? Aren't you on duty here? Yes, to preserve safety and honor. - What is it? - You see... - What day is it? - What is this nonsense? Crazy old man. If I see you again, you'll taste my shoe. Got it? My shoe. Scram. Taxi. - Sir. - I don't have a quarter. What quarter? You're so persistent. No, sir, it's not that. You want a whole pound? - Not a pound. - I don't have my checkbook on me. I beg you. Listen to me. Go ahead. Say it, recite it, sing it. I'm the victim of a horde of criminals. They want to corrupt a virtuous girl, the daughter of a basha. Basha? Like the ones in the movies? No, a real one. How is it my business? You must help me save her. - Where is she? - Inside that red inferno. Why should I involve myself? Just pretend you're her cousin. You found out she was here, you got angry, and you stormed into the place and dragged her out. Once she's out, leave it to me. Her cousin... I got angry... I stormed in.. Can I beat people? Of course. I don't mind. Let's do it. Shut up. Make way for the gentleman. Where is she? In the corner there. - The one laughing? - Yes. What is this? She's pretty. Yes, she's pretty and nice, but you're here to save her. Remember? She's lovely. This is not going well. I'll show you. My only hope in this life is to see you happy. If our separation brings you joy, then, please, stay away from me. As for me, no matter what happens, I will remain faithful to your love. Whether you're away for a day or a year, I will remain true to myself. I will never change. The days we lived together, I can live them again in my mind. And the dreams we dreamed together, I can roam inside them for ever. I wish I could burn your love into my eyes, so that if love ever departs, I'll still be able to gaze at you. Swear upon my agony, the agony you're so oblivious to. Swear upon my youth, the youth I sacrificed for you. If you ever stop loving me, lie to me and never tell me the truth. Let me carry on loving you, loving you on and on. Let me remain oblivious to the secret in your heart. Let me carry on loving you. Woe is me. Someone help me. Calm down. Keep your hands off me. You're having fun singing and dancing, you bastards? I'll show you. - Shame. - Shame? You talk of shame, you bastard? You owe everything to me. He sold my jewelry to drink champagne with her. I'm going to kill you. Police. Let's go. Hands off. Don't commit a crime. - Move away. - And you, ladies man... You'll deal with me. And with me too, you womanizer. What's this? Who are you? I'm... Her cousin. Me too. Cousins? How? - I am your cousin. - Yes he is. Let's go, you naughty girl. How are you my cousin? He's your cousin. End of story. You disgraced our family. You may not take her. Silence. - Let's go. - I don't know you. - I'm your cousin. - No. You overdid it. - Shut up. - Fine. Let's go. You got what you deserve. Really, miss. A nice girl like you, exposing herself to this. Singing, dancing, drinking... Singing, dancing, drinking. Set her straight. How could a sensible man like you allow this? I didn't allow anything. I don't know how I ended up here. Why it happened, I do not know. If you'd like to go out, there are more suitable venues. Just ask him. Seek his advice. Yes, seek his advice, instead of wreaking his life. A reasonable man like him, treat him like a trusted friend. Yes, a trusted friend. - A faithful companion. - Yes, a faithful companion. What fine words. Yes, indeed I'm faithful. - Treat him like your father. - Yes, your... - Father? - What is it? Nothing. Pay attention to the road. I have not introduced myself. Wahid Safwat. - I'm a pilot. - Pilot? A pilot in Egypt Air. - And you? - I... - I'm the same. - You're a pilot? Yes. You're fueled by gas and oil, and I'm fueled by sesame seeds and corn. - Sesame seeds? - My name is pigeon. How funny. So you're Hamam. And the lady? A little birdie? I've never seen such insolence. How dare you speak to me after you hit me? I can't forgive myself for that. How did my hand dare touch this delicate face? These cheeks, lovely as apples? Never mind apples and oranges. Please forgive me. You may hit me 10 times, 100 times, 1000 times. Dear me. Don't want to hit me? Just tell me. Your skin... Is it electrically charged? My hand is tingly. I beg you, please hit me. Look here. You better watch your words. Otherwise, I'll be the one who hits you. Forgive me. Give me your hand. Give me your head. - Dear me. - That's enough. You're even. Pay attention to the road. We're even. This is such sweet agony. Unbelievable. Dear sir, never mind your agony. Just drive please. Look straight ahead. - May I not speak? - You may not. Let him speak. I won't answer. Say what's on your mind. Fine. Speak. Spill your guts. - Is the lady engaged? - Yes. She is spoken for. What a shame. Why are you lying? I'm not engaged. Really? In that case, may I say... that I'm in love with you. I love you with all my heart. May god grant me happiness by your side. How lovely. Happy now? He spilled his guts. Stop the car. But... Fine. I'll stop. Down. Right here. - Our house. - Whose house? Our house. Right here. You there. Good night. Is this her house? Why do you want to know? - Let him ask. - Let him ask? - Let's go. - But tell me... If my father wants to meet her father, - would he come here? - Yes, right here. This house. Right here. Come to this house. - Good evening. - This house. Let's go. This house. - Let's go. - Where are we going? I've had enough from you. You're going to kill me. Yes? - Hi. - Hold on. - May I help you? - We... We want some water. Water? You think this is a cafe? We're thirsty. Is water expensive here? That's not it. You ask for water at this hour? - Isn't this Ismael's house? - Who? Big nose Ismael. No, he does not live here. Must be the wrong house. - We'll try the next one. - No one lives there. Fine, the one next to it then. - It's unoccupied. - We must have the wrong street. - Good night. - You stay put. I'm calling the police. Thieves. Bandits. Mohamed, help. Grab them. Shackle them. These criminals are trying new tricks on me. What is this? Master? What is it? Who are they? Youssef Wehbi? My god. The writer? Quick, let's go. You're not going anywhere. You deal with the master now. Bonsoir, sir. - Bonsoir. Or should we say bonjour? It's morning. How may I help? You see, we were... We were... Go ahead and explain what we're doing. We're digging our hole a little deeper. I don't understand. Who are you? He's my teacher. Mister Hamam. Hamam? Pigeon? Yes, my name is Hamam. My parents had a sadistic streak. And who would you be? She is Leila. Mourad Basha's daughter. You're neighbors. Indeed? A pleasure. Please sit. To what do I owe this pleasure? You see, we were... - You see... - You see, we were... We were... We were... What? We were taking a walk. Taking a walk at 2:00 AM? Yes, the daytime air is too polluted. Really? And then what? I don't know what got into us. He got into our car, actually. Your car? We somehow felt like knocking at your door. So we knocked at your door. I still don't understand. Do you want the truth? We're hiding. Really? Why? We committed a murder. Dear lord. A murder? Yes, in cold blood. My god. In cold blood? Yes, in cold blood. Do you think we're not up to it? Haven't you murdered millions? You're funny, mister sparrow. This one can murder a whole nation. In her eyes, I see innocence, but also cunning. I see magic and love, but also mischievousness. Sir. How are you? Please be quiet. Two hours after midnight, in the midst of calm and sleep, suddenly, unexpectedly, a pair of lovely eyes cast a spell on me. Such a unique persona, a soul that makes the human spirit soar in the skies, and swim in the waters of eternity. Sir. How are you? Good, thanks. - And you? - Good, thanks. - We must go. - No. - You must stay. - Sir. Mister Abdel Wahab is ready. I'm on my way. Abdel Wahab? The artist? Yes, he's inside. That's incredible. You don't believe me? That's all we needed. This just keeps getting better and better. - Let's go. - Wait. He's going to sing. He will? How nice. Please god, deliver me from this inferno. Abdel Wahab, here? Are we not going to find deliverance? Mister Hamam. Sir. Will he really sing? Yes. He's reciting a passage from a novel I'm writing. What is it about? It is about how a man who has great love for someone, a true love, will not stand in the way of his beloved's happiness. On the contrary. Even if she loves someone else. That is such a nice topic. It's a lousy topic. Nonsense. Why do you say that? It's a pointless novel. What kind of man who is love with someone, would be willing to let her go? Certainly. He should. He must be happy for her. He must sacrifice himself. That is utter nonsense. Who would... write this? I'll give you an example. See this lovely lady. You're much older than her, and from a different class. You are worlds apart. True. Worlds apart. Let's assume you love her. Hypothetically. - Yes. - Yes? - How could that be? - Hypothetically. Just an assumption. Let's assume you love her deeply, from the bottom of your heart. - Yes. - Yes? - How could that be? - We said hypothetically. Just play along. Yes, from the heart of my bottom. From the bottom of my heart. Let's assume that she does not love you. She loves another man. Naturally. True. In this case, would you, if you truly love her, would you be selfish and deny her happiness? You must sacrifice yourself. As the poet said, All I wish for is her happiness even if I have to give my life for it. There are popular sayings to that effect as well. Indeed. But what if the man she loves is a cabaret regular, and a serial womanizer? In that case, you must interfere. You must save her. What if he was a nice young man? A pilot, for example? A pilot. A pilot. A pilot who will fly away with her. Listen. Abdel Wahab has started the song. Come with me. Why? Why? Why are my nights so long? Why? Why? Why are my tears flowing? My beloved, why have you abandoned me? O night, sleeplessness is gnawing at me. O night, my cup overflows with tears. Every day at dawn, I rise and repeat my oath. My eyes come to life, they dampen my cheeks, and sing a reproach to the one who has robbed me of sleep. I've given my whole self to her. My life is not mine to live. I sacrificed my happiness for her. Only her memory sustains me. I'm a visitor in her world, every morning and night. O night. You're oblivious to it all, as I sit next to you. So many times have I tried to confess myself to you. But it was all for naught, you're oblivious to it all. You're soaring in the sky, while I wallow in the mud. I cradled my sorrow in my soul, and taught it to hold on to hope. I built a temple where I worship your love. I built it with my heart and my soul. Hope is a but a monk in this temple, he knows no other master, no one but you. I light a candle for another, while her fire consumes my being. I sell my soul, I ransom it. I am willing to sacrifice it all. The soul's love is boundless, but the body's love comes to an end. The body's love comes to an end. Mister Hamam. What is wrong with him? My dear, he loves you. Me? How? He loves you madly. Poor man. Impossible. It can't be. Why not? Many writers have studied this topic. I wrote about it as well. The innocent victim. Thanks, sir. Thank you. Life is a large stage. Mister Hamam, what's wrong? It's nothing. I got emotional. Abdel Wahab is so good. Forgive me. No, I wronged you. I'm sorry for what I said. I was just teasing you. Please forgive me if I hurt you. You, hurt me? You healed me. I was a blind man who has never seen the light. You're the sunshine that banished the darkness from my heart. Your love made me love life. Whatever brings you joy, brings me joy as well. If there's one thing I regret, and please forgive me, it's that... I had hopes I had no right to hold. Mister Hamam. Calm down, miss pilot. Where is that guy? Where is that funny fellow? - Maybe he left. - He'd be a fool to leave. If I were him, I would not budge. Here I am. Thank god I did not leave. Forgive me. I blame myself for this. I didn't understand. I'm sorry as well. I didn't realize you felt so strongly about me. I do not deserve the affection you have for me. Mister Hamam, I would never build my happiness at the expense of yours. That is true for me as well. I would not marry unless you approve. Me too, sir. Never mind this. We need to get home before the basha wakes up. May he be sleeping soundly. Let's go. Look that way. You'll look that way later. I sacrificed my happiness for her. Only her memory sustains me.
