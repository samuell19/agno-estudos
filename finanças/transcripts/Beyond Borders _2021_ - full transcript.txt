A PLACE OVER THE PACIFIC - What happened? - The fuel pump is damaged. - Can it not be used at all? - No. When it cracked, I could feel the air pressure from the tank. We have a maximum of 300 liters. Divided by 51... We have 5.9 flight hours in mind. 300 divided by 57... 5.3. So we run out of fuel... ... 40-50 kilometers from our destination. This is probably one of the worst places it could happen, right? The worst. It's too late to turn around. Faris Island is three hours from here. Now it will be an interesting trip. JP Schulze and Louis Cole wanted to fly around the world in a single-engine plane. This is their story. My name is Louis Cole, and for the last six years - - I've uploaded a video about my life almost every day. At first there were not many who followed me, but then it grew - - and I could share my adventures - - with people from all over the world. I have always wanted to inspire others to live life to the fullest. I've created a life - - where I can live out my passion for making films and traveling. On one of the trips, I met JP, who happened to be a pilot. We talked about how wild it would be to fly around the world. He had never tried anything so ambitious, but he agreed. My name is Jean-Peter Schulze, but most people call me JP. I am 23, grew up in Namibia and have always dreamed of flying. I started as an 11 year old and have always loved it. After school I quickly got stuck in the everyday drum room - - and the meeting with Louis inspired me to become more adventurous. I quickly dropped my career in architecture - - sold everything and left. I shared my adventures online and could take pictures - - while I was making money. A few years ago, I was cycling across the United States. Now I wanted on a new adventure. Police hope that today's protests are peaceful. There's been so much division in the world lately - - and it has become harder to trust what we hear. We wanted to see if the world was actually as divided as the media claims. We wanted to raise £ 100,000 on Kickstarter. When you do not reach the goal, you do not get the money. Who did it? We just got 1000 pounds. We did it! Is that really true? We are up to 100,000 pounds. We chose a Cessna 210 - - and called it Baloo, because it only had the most necessary. I had to spend all my savings on buying the plane. So important was the trip for me. - How are you, JP? - I'm happy. - It's good that we're not flying. - We would never have done that. The plan was to fly east, across the United States, up to Canada - - then to Greenland, Iceland, on to Europe - - down to Egypt, over to Abu Dhabi, then Pakistan, India - - across Southeast Asia, down to Australia and New Zealand - - saw some of the Pacific Islands, Fiji, Samoa, Kiribati and Hawaii. And then back to California. Then we would have reached all over the world. We decided to do it in 81 days. We probably believed in it to host a party on day 81. We are always asked why we do something so risky. We had very different personal reasons for it. We need some tools for the trip. JP wanted a wrench. I found it here. Life has made me insecure about myself and my abilities. It was not just about seeing the world. It was a big mental and physical challenge - - and to see if I could actually. Could I overcome my doubts about myself? Do something important and inspire others to do the same? Michelin men. I felt trapped in my own little bubble - - and lost focus on sharing people's stories. The media portrays the world as divided and full of hatred - racism and xenophobia. But is there also a little humanity? I had a burning urge to find the truth. When I was seven, my dad and his friends got excited - over two guys who arrived at the airport. I remember the two adventurers who stepped out. They were tanned and weathered. One of them was Mike Blyth, who had been on a record flight. He has since become a major role model for me - - and he has flown around the earth twice. I met JP when I flew an ultralight plane - - and stopped in Swakopmund when he was a little boy. That was probably when he felt like doing these wild things. They told me they had just flown here from South America. I was inspired and it became a goal for me. So would I. Flying around the world is the hardest thing I have tried. Some of the challenges are more technical. Such as flying far above the sea. When Louis first mentioned the earth orbit - - I had some sleepless nights. I considered the worst case scenarios - - and quickly learned to turn my brain off. We have become too scared to do things that we are afraid of. But I think you have to do exactly what you are afraid of. The pilot community was skeptical as it is actually irresponsible. At first I did not understand how dangerous it was. But as it approached, it dawned on me - - that there is probably a reason why so few have done so. You want to do something amazing, understand the risk - - and is ready to live with it. You do it because that's the way you are. If you have been called to an adventure, you have no choice. Off. The first thing to do is choose a plane. We chose a nearly 50 year old Cessna 210 - which had to be thoroughly repaired before it was ready. As standard, it has two fuel tanks with a total of 340 liters - as well as two small collection tanks connected to the engine. But we would get some long flights over water - - so we added three tanks of 518, 140 and 53 liters - - pressurized with a hand pump. - This is how we get fuel. - Manually? Okay, so you do not just press a contact? Now I no longer know exactly what JP is up to. I just trust he knows what he's doing. It is worrying to assemble a plane and have two screws left over. - Should I take it out? - If you want. We'll try this one first. We have to be careful, because if it cracks, we have big problems. What is it that makes the trip so dangerous? We're flying in a 45 year old plane. In addition, a single-engine aircraft, so if the engine puts out, you crash. Third, it is not built to fly that far. A 17-year-old pilot is dead and his father is missing - off the coast of American Samoa in the Pacific Ocean. They would fly around the world in a record attempt. Many have died during long-haul flights - - as they challenged fate, for it is necessary. One cannot fly around the earth without challenging fate a little. It's the day before departure. Do you feel ready? Not at all. What do you think will be the biggest disagreement between us? That I question your judgment. Louis is nonchalant by nature. That's what makes him great. But it also makes him a nightmare compared to a plane. Close it and we're got the pressure in there. - No, open the other one. - No no... I was trying to get two people around the world in a Cessna 210. A plane that was in no way built for it. I would not be remembered as an idiot who had beaten himself - - and his friend to death by carelessly trying to fly around the earth. - I will miss you all the way. - I know. Today we have to fly around the world. KERN VALLEY, CALIFORNIA 81 DAYS LEFT Around the world, mate. Around the world. Now we do. We will do it... - I hope the camera rolls? - It's rolling. - Now I'm better. - I always feel better in the air. Facilitating was one of the best sensations. We had to explore the whole world and looked forward to the adventure. Good morning, this is Kern Airport. Click the radio three times for advice, four for radio checks. We did it! The first trip. - Bum... - No, no... Fist. - I just saw a lightning bolt. - Okay? We're not going anywhere. It's the weather radar right now. In theory, we could try to wind our way through it - - but it's too dangerous. This can close at any time. And since we have to fly in the dark, it's a bad idea. The next morning we set off, eager to reach as far as possible. Propeller ready. The storm from last night had moved well over 1500 kilometers - - so JP was sure it worked. The problem of having to fly during a storm - - is that the information you can get about the weather - - are not perfect. A Cessna 210 can not fly so high - and you can not fly too low because of the terrain - - and mountains and so on. In a large passenger plane, you fly over most weather. We could fly at an altitude of 4300 meters at most, so we experienced the weather. We had to deal with what everyone else is flying over. And where are you right now? Just relieved at St. Joseph, on his way to Fort Wayne, FWA. Our only weather instrument was a storm display - which could show electrical activity and lightning strikes within a radius of 160 km. It was quite active at one point. There was a lot of electrical activity. There are constant signs that one is challenging fate. If you are a good pilot, you listen to them - - while a bad pilot continues - - and ends up in a dangerous situation. I ignored it. We should get back - - and even though there were three more months, I felt the pressure. You can not fly around the earth if you are waiting for perfect weather. At some point, one has to leave. Sometimes you can make mistakes and end up in a storm. Suddenly we could see nothing. It was some of the worst turbulence I have experienced. The height indicator turned 90 degrees - - which means that you fly upside down. I thought we were going to die. In a particularly bad storm - - structural damage to the aircraft may occur. Lightning strikes are also a risk. If you are not an experienced pilot, you can lose control. I followed their route online - - and saw that they were heading for a thunderstorm. There was a massive thunder belt - - probably 1600 km long, across the United States. I texted JP about what the hell he was doing. "You must land now!" I tried to talk to the air traffic controller - - to get as much information as possible. I did not know what was going on - - and went for a walk because I thought they would probably die. Then he said something that I do not know if he had to - - but that saved our lives - - namely that there was a tornado a few kilometers from us. It was extremely dangerous, and he explained it to me. He said we had to land. "We should not be in the middle of this. We have made a mistake." I do not like this at all. These are some very strong gusts of wind. -Okay. -Look at my hands. I think I should throw up. Next day when we landed near Boston - - we met with JP's friend Matt. Matt himself has flown around the world - - as one of the youngest. Matt should share his expertise and advice with us - - and solve the problems we ran into. We have to wear the suits. Matt is already struggling with it. This is the first very difficult trip on this journey - - because it's a really difficult terrain - - and then we have to fly over water. The most dangerous stages are those over water. One flies over the sea for hours and there is nowhere to land. If the engine shuts down and you have to land on water... This is the most dangerous thing you can come across. One hopes that it will not happen, but one must be prepared. When it's so far north, you can only swim for 30 seconds - - after which you lose the ability to swim - - because one's muscles get so cold and it goes fast. So these suits are extremely important. Luckily there were no problems and the next two trips went fine. It was nice to have Matt on board. It made me less stressed. Even though he got to pee on my seat. You did not need that. It was the first time I felt like we were in the middle of the unknown. We were on our way to the real adventure. Greenland is the world's largest island - and although three quarters are covered by ice - - many have visited it over the years. Norsemen, Inuit, Portuguese and Danish explorers. It is a mixture of Inuit and Scandinavian culture. What a place. It's one of the coolest airports I've been to. Clearly. If there's anyone in the area - - late tonight or early tomorrow who could show us around... Throughout the trip I have met locals - - by posting what we do on social media - - and wait for people to respond. How I got in touch with the local girl Natasha - - who offered to give us a taste of Greenland's history. Greenland is a large country, but with a small population. Only about 57,000 people live here. I'm proud to be a Greenlander - - because we are strongly connected to our culture and nature. It is important to preserve the culture and its authenticity. Why? Because we do not want to change it so much that at some point we - - forget it. Greenland has risen above much of what divides us - - but they still have a problem that is difficult to escape. Now for a serious warning against climate change. According to experts, we have until 2030 to avoid a disaster. 80 percent of Greenland is still under ice. If it all melted, sea levels would rise by seven meters. One quickly discovers that the locals are deeply concerned - - about the climate change they are experiencing in the country. They can see the catastrophe unfold - - and it is a reminder that our actions - - can have devastating and far-reaching consequences. Two locals, Mika and JJ, talked to me about their personal experiences. Every winter the whole harbor froze to ice. We no longer see that. When taking the flight from Kangerlussuaq to Nuuk - - you can clearly see that the ice disappears. The glaciers used to be white. Now they are tender blue or dark. The deeper part of the glacier becomes visible. It has never happened before. We must preserve the planet. Just as Greenland is a warning story about climate change - - it's also a story of hope, beauty and the wealth of the planet. The flight away from Greenland was risky. We flew across the ice sheet that covers almost all of Greenland. Then we crossed more of the North Atlantic to get to Iceland. So what? It is cool. The mountain peeks out. It is nice. Next stop was Iceland. I was used to flying daily, so that pressure was relieved a bit. But I could not relax. The date of our return always lurked in the back of my mind. Such a long journey requires a support team - - and we had a hard time communicating with the producer. We were already a week late - - but Iceland was still a welcome diversion. REYKJAVIK, ICELAND 72 DAYS BACK Hi, my name is Helgi and I am the son of Helgi. So I'm Helgi Helgison. This is how it is in Iceland. Driving in Iceland in converted jeeps is my dream. And 15 years ago, it became my job. When we reached Iceland, we went on a little adventure - - to the southern part of the island and up a volcano. We met a really cool guy, Helgi, who drove us up the volcano - - and he was very interesting. I asked a little about his life and passions. This is my home and I live in a camper so I can move - - and work where I want. I'm for adventure. The best thing is freedom. His life revolved around driving four-wheel drive vehicles - - and to take tourists on long journeys. He was so crazy about it that he lived in a camper van. It was cool to meet someone who was so passionate about his passion. It was so cool to see someone who lived out his dream - - and was so crazy about his life. He did not live up to what society expected of him. Although he was very different from me, we were also very similar. As a child, I imagined being in other parts of the world - - and turned my bedroom into a jungle. And living in that fantasy world shaped my view of the world - - and what I wanted. And later, when I was in my twenties - - I decided to experiment - - and moved into a small minibus - - where I survived almost without money and could travel - - do a lot with my friends and travel all over Europe. It showed me that I could always stay in a minibus - - almost homeless and without money. We have finally reached the top of the glacier. Now we just have to go up to the top. It's like Pride Rock, so I'll have to go up there. We flew on to England where my family was waiting at the airport. We had time for a flight with my dad and grandpa. It is an honor to be able to fly three generations together. But we still had a long way to go, and the return date was approaching. The flight was fun - - but I had to work hard to make it safe. N210EU, we are ready to depart. NY20. I have spent months making a checklist that I follow every time. Some of the first thing I check is IM SAFE. It ensures that I, as a pilot, can complete the flight. If I can cross everything off, I've done my part for safety. Lots of space. Yes that's fine. I spend a lot of time behind the computer to get the best possible picture - - of the weather and what we can expect. We have some problems, because this weather is not to be trifled with. It freezes, which can create severe flooding. JP's friend Dima took us on our trip to Germany - - and got a baptism of fire when we experienced something unexpected. We discovered a lot of ice on the wings - - and there was ice on the windshield. Can ice be life threatening? A lot, it's something that costs the most life. Ice is formed when flying into icy rain - - when it freezes and the rain turns to ice. Two things can happen. First, the ice cream gives an extra weight - - and secondly, the shape of the wing ensures that you can fly. And the ice changes the shape of the wing. I discovered the ice because our speed dropped by 37 km / h. And there is no other explanation. And the more ice, the more the speed slows down. - Flight control service, N210EU. - Here you go. Can we get a flight altitude of 2100 meters? What is the minimum height? The minimum altitude right now is 1500 meters. Let's turn on the defrost. Nothing really happens. What about now? Is that better? You can see that it is starting to disappear. Such... We luckily got the plane de-iced and landed safely. But when we landed in Germany, I began to realize - - that tensions had arisen between me and JP. BADEN-BADEN, GERMANY 64 DAYS LEFT We met Felix, as some know from "Expedition Happiness". We had a long talk about how the trip went - - and some of the problems JP and I had. And we understood that we communicate in very different ways. The day before you get a schedule and I fly. Whether you are ready, you must stay there. But think about it. I've only missed one plane, ever. I try to calm the tension so I keep quiet. I can not feel it. Raya must say if she is upset. I go for what she tells me. I expect you to sense if I'm impatient. For the first time, Louis and I were open to a third party - - around our different personalities. Then it dawned on me that this trip - - maybe was too demanding for us. On a trip like this, you spend days in a very small place. Right next to each other, under extremely tense conditions. Then there will always be conflict. One must be aware of the other's feelings. I was not very good at listening to JP's concerns - - or understand the pressure he's under. He disagrees with our producer, and some of her decisions - - has weakened our security and made work more difficult. He has felt ignored. I've been under tremendous pressure to keep to the schedule - - which made it difficult to wait for two weeks during repairs. We decided to go our separate ways until the plane was repaired. Okay, yes. Right now I have mixed feelings. I feel a little empty, a little less excited - - generally just completely exhausted. Maybe it's good with a little break. IS brutality and the war in Syria have triggered a humanitarian crisis. The largest wave of refugees in modern times. In recent years, the refugee crisis has divided people around the world. I wanted to talk to both the refugees and the Europeans who welcomed them. While JP took care of the plane, I went to the island of Lesbos - - which at one time received over 3000 refugees a day. I talked to people who had been through the crisis. At one point, corpses could be seen on the beaches of Lesbos. It was something that happened every day. That was the scariest thing. At one point, one was no longer shocked. We saw people drowning almost five feet from the shore. They could just jump out of the boats and go to safety. But then they panicked. They drowned in a meter deep water. We had to pull the boats in. One day I opened my front door - - and then 50 refugees just standing in the park. They had arrived on a boat the day before. They have to pay thousands of dollars to get on board the boats. They both are not safe to say the least. If a boat is built for 20, there will be 50-100 in it. My first reaction was to withdraw. I did not feel that there was anything I could do. One saw small children and the elderly. I was shocked and paralyzed. It took me one to two months to restart - - and say to myself that I had to be cooler. Then we started coming to help at the coast at six o'clock - - or five in the morning before work. Half a million people arrived on the island. I was once in the port city, where there are about 27,000 - - and they estimated that there were 30,000 refugees. Most locals in Mitilini were themselves refugees. They got houses here and started from scratch. We have a clear sense of what it means to be a refugee. People in Mitilini welcomed the refugees. FREIBURG, GERMANY 58 DAYS LEFT In Germany, I met Alaska, who had arrived from Syria. Alaska is obviously the hummus master. - Is that the specialty? - That's the specialty of Palestine. In 2011, everything was good. I went to university and in one day everything changed. Syrian security guards opened fire on protesters - - and between 20 and 100 have died in unprecedented protests against Bashar. Lots of people demonstrating - - and government forces fired sharply at the protesters. - Did they just kill them? - They started killing them. One after another. Ten people became 100 and then 1000. It was a killing machine. I lost friends. Where are Ahmed, Mahmoud and Hossam? They had demonstrated for two days and were no longer there. Alaska felt compelled to flee the country on a boat. The boat trip was something I had not anticipated. It was the middle of the night. I was surprised because the smugglers said, "Okay, it's tonight." The plan was to get 20-25 in the boat built for 19 passengers. I discovered that there were 55 - - who was waiting to get on board the small boat. You had no other choice. Becoming friends with Alaska was a highlight of the trip. He was so happy and a pleasure to be with. - Enter! - I'm going inside. That he had learned nine different languages ​​- and fluent German in less than a year - said something about his resources and willingness to start a new life - - and contribute to society. It is cool. Then it was time to be reunited with JP. It was a good day. Everything was fixed and we were looking forward to flying again. There she is. - And I've found a Louis. - Yes! And we are with Baloo again. It was time to leave Europe and fly to North Africa. I was looking forward to the rest of the trip. We had crossed the North Atlantic. It was a huge milestone. I was looking forward to the rest. I felt I could handle everything without any problems. Matt and Dima had left us in Germany, so there were only the two of us. We were fresh and ready for Egypt. We had heard that you could not just land at those airports - with plain clothes, because they do not have civilian pilots. In Egypt, it is a good idea to wear a pilot uniform. It just makes things a lot easier. I have to wear my stripes. Like a real pilot. So we had to buy some uniforms and I dressed up as a pilot. Private flights do not exist in large parts of the world. Many do not have the luxury of owning a small plane. A pilot in Egypt does not wear civilian clothes. I feel sorry for all the pilots who have earned the uniform. I feel like a scammer. Africa. This is the continent I was born on. I've flown here from California. It's awesome. It was a big milestone for me to fly back to Africa. Growing up in Africa... It's far from where I grew up. But it's the same continent, and it's pretty incredible - - and I never thought I would fly to Egypt. We have experienced so many different terrains - - from mountains, forests, tundra, ice sheets, cities and landscapes - - to suddenly see the desert as far as the eye can see. In Egypt, we had to land on a military base. We were both nervous and did not know what to expect. We had heard about pilots being detained. The Middle East is a kind of war zone at the moment. It is dangerous to fly there. One can be shot down. There were bunkers that had been bombed next to us - - and they were still in use. The Egyptian F-16 fighters were there - - and ready to go on the wings. We had no problems at the base - - and that privilege was emphasized by the many aircraft - left behind due to new legal provisions in the country. It's wild to walk among the wreckage and imagine their lives. Even this hot air balloon basket. It's incredible. JP had to rest so I went exploring in Cairo. CAIRO, EGYPT 52 DAYS LEFT We often get the same media story from the Arab countries. It is usually negative. Egyptian security forces have killed 40 suspected militants - - after a roadside bomb killed four people. But a country is full of stories, and I should not look long - - to find kind believers who made a difference in people's lives. Noor and Omar run a mentoring project at an orphanage - - and they shared their thoughts on bad stories. In my personal experience, there are many stereotypes. Arabs regard Westerners as people who drink - - and likes to do all the bad things. And Westerners - - sees us as a collection of tents and camels and the like. They do not even see the buildings. This is how we look at each other. It surprised me how ignorant people outside the Arab world are. They have not even put themselves into what we have. I think Islamophobia is due to the media. Can you judge a place you have never been? Can you judge a people you have not collaborated with - - or seen how they treat others? Everyone needs to be loved and accepted. It is a basic human need. And Islamic countries have not received much love from other countries. These kids are crazy. They swing in my hair. With Noor and Omar's care - - I dare to hope that these children will not grow up with prejudice - - based on people's race, religion or culture. - and it's a reminder that I must not have it either. Over Saudi Arabia we experienced a strong headwind - - which meant that we ended up with very little fuel. It just suddenly dawns on me what we are doing. - Flying around the world? - Yes, it just hit me. I also forget it sometimes - - and then you think: "I live the dream." I had to consider whether we should fly to a Saudi airport - pay huge fines and possibly be questioned by the military, - or if I should use the extra fuel and tanks in the air. Let me try not to swallow Avgas. It looks like a raspberry slush. It's so blue. I just feel like drinking it. - Well, you got something. - A little. - Oh no. - It actually does not taste so bad. Ordinary gasoline is worse. Refueling from plastic containers in the air - - is extremely risky. When working with fuel, you are in danger - - and the slightest spark can make it all explode. I just got a mouthful of fumes. Do you want to send a position report? N210EU, GAS. Flight altitude 3350 meters. When you are a pilot and visit so many amazing places - - is it easy to forget that I am living out my dream. A wind check for the N210EU. The wind is 020 degrees, three seconds. I landed in beautiful cities - - explored amazing places and met amazing people. We met my friend Haifa, who has worked in television - - but now has its own successful Youtube channel. Stick me the microphone, let me just say something. The girl from the Middle East came down to represent... We talked about racial and religious conflicts. My name is Haifa and I am originally from Palestine. I quit my job at television to start my Youtube channel - - and travel around and make as many friends as possible. I'm very keen to show the truth - - and the true picture of who we are, where we live - - and how things actually go. I could feel the hatred that was seen between people all over the world. And not just us. Other cultures are also exposed to stereotypes. I grew up with racism, discrimination - racial prejudice and racial segregation. It was only when I started traveling that I got rid of it. I grew up in Namibia, one of the most beautiful countries in the world - full of diverse ecology, geology and cultures. But like South Africa, there are deep historical divides - - and the divisive mentality is still quite clear. I have traveled the world and met many people - - which has challenged my attitudes, norms and prejudices - - and when you really get to know people from all walks of life - - I have no doubt that they are incredibly caring and friendly. Everyone deserves to be treated as individuals - not judged on the basis of skin color, religion or language. Traveling has taught me a lot about different cultures. It has taught me to value diversity, acceptance and love. We have parked and can now see the sunset. Oh yes. Are we stuck? We can dig it away. I help. I am filming. I would like to help, but get it in the eyes. - Congratulations! - It was teamwork. I had to raise $ 5,000, because in the next few countries - - we can not pay by credit card. Ready for takeoff. Three, one... We contact 1500... My friend JC has joined us to help film So we have disguised him as a pilot and have flown to Pakistan. Good to be in the air again. We have come to Pakistan. It's wild. Rent chaos. I was really looking forward to exploring Pakistan - - because it's a place that few travel to - - since the media only report negative things from there. Pakistan is on guard after Thursday's attack. According to a government spokesman, at least 126 people have died. When we entered Karachi, we noticed the beautifully painted trucks - and the taxi driver said it was a tradition - - where every driver takes pride in decorating his truck. We met Maz, who took me and JP out to explore Karachi. When do you hear about Pakistan in the media? We only seem relevant when something dangerous has happened. The media's decisions about what's relevant to you - - can be quite dangerous. The stories that sell well are the ones that spread fear. They sell well. When you travel, you see the bigger picture - - which we only see part of at home - - and learns that the headlines do not tell everything. I love it. People play cricket on the street. See. I loved it. I hovered on a pink cloud. It was one of my best travel experiences ever. Okay, then it's JP's turn. Yes! What was it like playing with a plank? Difficult. - I did not... - It was a good blow. Today we are going to India. The flight apparently takes five hours and I have not slept last night. NAGPUR, INDIA 39 DAYS LEFT What I love about India is the beautiful chaos. Walking on the street is a sensory cornucopia. It's hard to capture on camera because it hits all the senses. We met with Divia, who took us to an ancient temple. My name is Divia and I come from Nagpur where I was also born. I have lived in Nagpur for the last 20 years. For Indians, there are two major professions. Either doctor or engineer. To do something third, like my brother who is a film photographer - - is not socially acceptable. Wherever you go, you understand that people categorize. From a young age, we try to put people in stalls - - and allows those booths to define us. We split up on the basis of different things - - as a religion or race, which is really sad. If we remove those barriers, we could easily be united. Some of what I enjoyed most was that there were no other strangers. It was a part of India that people do not visit. Both Louis and I visit the less popular places - - and in that respect Nagpur did not disappoint. It was the ideal place to take part in their culture. It was a great place. Wherever you went, there was dancing - - and it was hard not to get excited about their lifestyle. There was bad weather on the way, so we had to change route - - and fly over Indonesia. - It does not look good tomorrow. - No. One would prefer to avoid Indonesian airspace. There are so many stories of people having to make emergency landings in Indonesia - - and then being surrounded by soldiers. But we had no choice. We can not see if we are approaching a storm. You can not see six kilometers ahead. It was at those times that the journey really burdened me. It is a quarter to four o'clock. I have not slept at all. The others have apparently been given 30-45 minutes. Either way, it will be an adventure. I was nervous about flying over Indonesia - - and would not lose touch with the air traffic control service. We were so far from land that we lost the VHF connection. Any traffic at 123.6? N210 The EU must have forwarded a message. So I sent VHF for about an hour blind - - to get people to forward a message. Everyone ignored me. The satellite phone did not work. Any traffic at 119.75? The N210EU must have forwarded a message. God damn. I just knew I was going to have problems - - because if you fly without being able to communicate with the outside world - - in Indonesia, the military discovers it and they react to it. Any traffic at 119.75? The N210EU must have forwarded a message. If you fly over places like Indonesia - - where they generally do not have private air traffic - - but only large passenger aircraft - - and losing the connection, it is extremely stressful. A fighter plane is shown behind us. Do you want to look? What's on the radar? Is it a plane? It must be fighter jets. He is lying high up behind us. - Keep an eye out. - I can not see anything. I saw two dots on my TCAS and they moved fast - - with 700-1100 km / h, extremely fast. I could see them coming and laying down behind me. I'm sure they had me on the corn. If there's one thing you do not want to see, it's a military plane. - who comes up and monitors one. And you know what it is, because they fly much faster - than any civilian aircraft. Any traffic at 119.75? The N210EU must have forwarded a message. I've been trying to find one for three quarters of an hour. At that point, I sent every 30 seconds. I would not let them shoot us down, but make sure they heard us. Any traffic at 119.75? The N210EU must have forwarded a message. Without communication, you can not tell them that you are not dangerous. Without radio contact, they consider one as a potential threat. It's a pretty dangerous situation. One flew away from the other and lay about 1600 meters behind me. I thought, "Then we're driving." Any traffic at 119.75? The N210EU must have forwarded a message. The N210EU has just flown past Mimix - - on the way to Rubkah at 04.42 Zulu. We do not have a VHF connection at the moment. It took 45 minutes. After manic communication, they realized that I was following my route - - and schedule and desperately tried to get in touch with someone. So I was no threat and they disappeared again. The good thing is, we were not shot down today. We have just arrived at a pretty nice hotel. I am looking forward to that. After a very long day of travel - - you need a nice place. I've been planning something with Raya, Louis' boyfriend, for months. Before we left California, we had agreed. JP just said we'll be flying tomorrow. The weather looks good. Raya is to surprise Louis in Bali. She's already there. We are all looking forward to a little relaxation in Bali. We hope to be there for at least four days, maybe a week. Yesterday she told him she could not meet him on the trip - - and he was really down about it. But he just wanted to know. BALI, INDONESIA 32 DAYS BACK I have always loved surprises and have planned one for Louis. When JP said I had the chance in Bali, I struck out. Louis expected us to meet in Australia. But I said I did not know if I could get my visa. So he thought we might not be able to meet at all. Arriving in Bali... Stop then. I can remember the excitement of looking at Louis - - who had no idea what was going to happen. I came to Bali that morning and hid in the room. I'm in Bali! It's so good to be here. I have taken a bath and feel like a human again. JP sent a message when they arrived and I hid in the bathroom. Raya waits, and Louis has no idea. This is where we'll be staying for the next few days. In the beach house. Fat, goodbye. Surprise! - There we got you! - Hi! What? My God... What the hell? I had no idea. Jesus Christ. Seeing Louis walk in the door and be surprised - - and happy to see Raya was very rewarding for me. I was in the bathroom shaking. I was so nervous and when he opened the doors - - and I saw his face, I knew it had succeeded. It's so good! It was without a doubt the best surprise of my life. I had no idea she would be there. It was a total shock. After all the anxiety about whether it would succeed - - it was the best feeling to hug him. It was so much fun to be in Bali and I miss Louis - - so it was great to travel a little together again. - One, two, run! - Yes! Now we had to say goodbye to JC - - and Raya was to be our passenger to Australia. WEST COAST OF AUSTRALIA 28 DAYS BACK - I love it! So good. - Welcome to Australia! There was blue sky and blue sea. It was truly heavenly. We flew across the outback to the country's most famous place, Uluru. It was a red rock lying in the middle of the wilderness. At Alice Springs, we were warned of a no-fly zone. They asked if he could see it. - N210EU. - Here you go. Are you aware of the no-fly zone R215 - - west of Alice Springs? Yes, confirmed. R215. I have it on the screen and keep my distance. So he checked his cards and said he knew. He was aware of the flight ban and wanted to avoid the area. Which emoji do you use the most? - A smiley. - I have to check mine. Probably the middle finger. It's really hard to flirt without an iPhone. Yes, damn it. - I remember when you did not have one. - Yes. That's why it took so long. I could not flirt with you. You said "hello" and I said "hello". Oh, for ---. Pardon. I flew right into the no-fly zone. - It is a lie. - Now I'm really getting into trouble. Suddenly I saw my iPad bright red - - as a warning that I was in a no - fly zone. And that was the circular area I had been warned about. That was exactly what I flew over. This is one of the worst things you can do as a pilot. I made the sharpest possible evasive maneuver - - and turned sharply to the right. Louis and Raya were probably fucking in their pants. I do not think the 210 has ever turned so sharply. We had violated the law and were afraid of the consequences. Would we be arrested? We did not know about the Australian procedure, but it was serious. I can be arrested when we land. Flying into a no-fly zone could put an end to the journey. One can also be shot down or they can seize one’s plane. One must make sure to avoid those areas. - Is it a military plane? - It's shown. I'm probably done. When we landed, we wanted to check out what an area it was. A no-fly zone can be anything. He said you never know what that means. It can be nothing or a big thing. But when we landed, we realized it was something very big. The two main no-fly zones were Area 51 in the United States - - and the area we just flew over. The area is operated in cooperation with the United States and registers missiles - and nuclear activities in North Korea and the like. So that we flew in over it was a big thing. My only hope is that my evasive maneuver - - can save me. It's something you can go to jail for - - but fortunately no one was waiting to arrest us. Okay, we escaped. We were very late, so we did not stay long in Australia - - but flew on to New Zealand. In Sydney, tensions arose again between me and JP - - so it was probably good that he could spend some time in his home country. - My house is right there. - Yes. It was great to land in New Zealand. It's Jetstar 20103 from Sydney. When can we expect the next video? You fly around the world, don't you? I can confirm that. I tried to forward my position - - and did so via a Jetstar A320. The guy answered and said: "Are you the crazy people who fly around the world in a Cessna?" I replied, "Yes, it's us." A bit of a bunch. Good to see you. - Hi, Louis. How are you? - Good to see you. We wanted to know more about the Maori people - - which is the native people. JP was with his family and I was to meet Serena. She told me about her Maori heritage. My name is Serena. I am Maori and Native American. My Maori tribes are Nga Puhi and Ngati Porou. Long ago, when New Zealand was colonized - - they would not let the children speak Maori in schools. They got banked at school if they spoke Maori. So it was close to extinction. Then people started thinking it was the original culture - - and changed attitude, so now things are in both English and Maori. The national anthem is available in both English and Maori. It probably makes me more proud to be a Maori than otherwise. It was good to see how the Maori culture was celebrated - - because in so many countries, the original culture has been eradicated. What makes New Zealand particularly interesting - - is that they have found a healthy way to embrace that culture. Maori culture has been integrated into much of the country's identity. It was time to fly over the Pacific Ocean. Raya had been taken home and JP had just said goodbye to the family - - so the emotions were outside the clothes. We again disagreed regarding our producer - - and the last thing we needed on the way to Kiribati - - was that something was going to go wrong. - Damn it! - What happens? The fuel pump is broken. - Can it not be used at all? - No. When it cracked, I could feel the air pressure from the tank. - Uha. - Yes, we can not use it. If I do this, air will just come out. Okay. So we have 150... We have a maximum of 300 liters. Divided by 51... We have 5.9 flight hours in mind. So we run out of fuel... ... 40-50 kilometers from the destination. This is probably one of the worst places it could happen, right? The worst. It's too late to turn around. Faris Island is three hours from here. The fuel tanks are in the wings. Once used - - do you have extra tanks at the back of the hull. To run the fuel, the tanks must be pressurized. This pushes the fuel to the engine. If there is no more fuel coming from those tanks - - you have a serious problem. The pump must be repaired very quickly, otherwise the motor will stop. It is not stuck at all. No? Wrong quantity. Yes, the glue is not stiff enough. Fandens. I just ruined it. - I'll get a hug about it. - Yes. And then I wrap string around here save the clamp - - then the clamp holds the string to the bottom and pulls it down. You pull the clamp down, I have the string. All the way down. Okay, take the string again. All. Okay. As tight as possible. Let me see how it goes. I think we're building a pressure. I'm pretty sure we have one. So... We're driving. We drive. If we get it all out, there are no problems. The fuel pump was fixed, but the voltage was not. I knew JP and I were quite different - - with different views on life and ways of dealing with things. It manifested itself in the way we handled - the person who caused the problems. He made mistakes that had very serious consequences. I kept explaining it to Louis, and he agreed - - but always gave the producer another chance. I do not understand that you still support her. Not supporting, but we must remain good friends until it is over. Why? He did not understand that she caused a lot of extra stress - which ultimately weakens security. I tried to find the balance between enjoying the trip - - make sure we had fun on this amazing adventure - - but also assure JP that I listened to him and took him seriously. I respected his opinion, because he knows more. Our friendship probably suffered permanent damage after Sydney. I will never fully respect you again. When you just asked me to deal with it - - without getting angry about it. And she just got away with it. But if we had mixed your family into it - - and something had gone wrong... I did not suggest that. I was just saying she was like a 19 year old. And you put her over me. It was only months with... ... pressure and then the case with the bad producer. And at that point, it exploded. When we got to Kiribati, the poor people there must have been so confused - - because we got off the plane and before anyone could say anything... The authorities could not talk to us - - because we were literally shouting at each other. She has forced me to compromise and make bad decisions. The way you reacted and treated her - - is disrespectful to me. Let's discuss it after the trip, because otherwise it will be ruined by it. As we flew from Kiribati, we were again reminded of climate change. The island is threatened with extinction and some villages are already gone. - Such. - Hawaii! I had been looking forward to Hawaii from the start - - because Hawaii is one of the places where I could live. It is like paradise on earth, incredibly beautiful. And I met Leana-Alla - - who taught me the meaning of "aloha". Hawaiian culture is shrouded in what we know about the word "aloha". Aloha means face. Ha is the breath that gives life. Here we learn that one aloha everyone. You love everyone. Our island exudes love. If I aloha you, you're my family. To see how Hawaiians traditionally lived - - reminded me that we did not live in harmony with the planet. That attitude is something people can learn from Hawaiian culture. The whole trip had been governed by our deadline. The big homecoming party in Kern Valley. We knew that date and settled for it - - when we decided how long we were going to stay. We always revolved around that date. On this flight we had to use more fuel. We had to change the layout of the plane - - and remove all rear seats. It required a lot of preparation and then there was a lot of paperwork. We reckoned it would take two to three days - - and after two or three days we had nothing - not even after another two days. I became really impatient because we were going to get home for the meeting. When faced with the last part, the tension grows. The last flight, and then you get stuck. It's demoralizing. The days go by and I hear nothing from the FAA. No answer at all. Hundreds of people are waiting for us in California. People come from all over the world to join. It was approaching and it seemed unlikely that we would achieve it. We had one day to arrive and it did not look good. We have to wait for the miraculous opportunity - - that we can get the papers in order. The thing is, we do not have the necessary paperwork - - for various reasons. If we do not have them tomorrow night, we can not leave. We'll probably find out what's going on tomorrow. Whether we can complete the earth orbit as planned. HONOLULU, HAWAII A DAY BACK Early this morning at seven o'clock - I was woken up by JP talking to that inspector - - who has approved the aircraft's fuel tank. And it has all been resolved. I remember just shouting. Louis slept and woke up confused. I looked at him and said, "We have the approval." He got up in a way that no guy has gotten up before. He said, "That's a lie." There she is, friends. Baloo is ready. Ready for the flight of a lifetime. There was no doubt that the last flight was the most dangerous. It is a very long trip with a single-engine aircraft. A Cessna 310 had run dry on the way to Hilo. It is 3900 kilometers without stop. That was why we needed the extra tanks and papers. We were so happy, but now I had to face my biggest fear. We completely filled up the plane and removed all the other seats. You have a huge amount of fuel next to you. There is a risk of fumes and a spark would cause - - the biggest explosion, so... I fill up the big tank. This departure I have been thinking about throughout the trip. If something goes wrong, you do not survive. They had to drop time restrictions and clear the entire airspace for us. We lift heavier than the official weight limit. So we are heavier than the plane is designed for. It increases the risk. It has a hard time easing. We need a longer runway. - Are you ready? - I'm ready. You just fly. You can fly, JP. You've always done that. The overweight loads the plane so it rises very slowly. Flying over terrain, buildings and trees is very risky. We were also a flying bomb because of all the fuel. This is it. - I should have shit before. - Should you? No, I'm just kidding. Then it was now or never. - Okay, then we're driving. - Come on. When we were on the runway, there was no going back. You fly with a too heavy plane that is not designed for this - - so you are actually a test pilot. 111 km / h. An airplane must reach a certain speed in order to fly. 130 km / h. The extra fuel makes it much heavier. It takes much longer to take off and ascend. So one has to be very precise during takeoff. 148 km / h. We gained more and more speed and were very heavy. My biggest concern was the tires. A puncture at that time was the worst that could happen. Okay, she wants to fly, so I let her fly. I just want to keep her low. Good and low. Come on. Then we hovered over the runway for some time and gained speed. Okay, she's free. 195 km / h. It's crazy. When we were relieved and understood that it had succeeded - - and had reached a safe height, relieved the pressure from JP's shoulders. I felt like we were having a good time together again. There was a camaraderie. We had the last flight together. All the tension disappeared - - and we thought it was the last stage. I could feel a great joy and excitement. Louis and I were both turned on. We were on our way. A few hours before, we did not know if it would succeed. Partner, we're flying to California! - It's insane. - This is our finest moment. The sun goes down, we are 3000 meters above the Pacific Ocean. We are so far from land. There are 3,200 miles to California. - 12 hours. - 12 hours. And we have to fly all night. Before the trip I had never crossed a sea - - and now I had to cross the biggest. I was relieved that the takeoff went well. But it was quickly overshadowed by the uncertainty and the long flight. The first phase of total darkness is very unpleasant - - because you are completely dependent on that engine. If one cannot see the water, a successful landing is impossible. It's the certain death. San Francisco, N210EU. On that flight, I thought back on the whole trip - - and all the challenges we had faced. I felt more vulnerable because we had come so far - - and if it did not succeed, it would be the worst. As the fuel dwindled, the changed center of gravity disturbed - - for some reason the autopilot - - and the plane became unstable. It got worse and worse. It's so weird. It's unstable. - Is not it quite violent? - Yes. It would tear the plane to pieces. Then I had to fly manually. On the long trips, autopilot is always preferred. First of all, it flies much better than you do - - and if it fails, you have to fly manually. And it's hard to do hour after hour on long trips. And you can not risk falling asleep - for under one is the sea. The flight went from being long to being extremely tiring. The possibility of resting smoke in the sink. It became an ironman who demanded alf what I had. I saw the lights. - I can see light! - I can see them! You go from being completely isolated - - to see a small light and it was so small. It's hard to explain how small that flash of light was. We have flown around the earth. It's so cool. It's so cool. - It's unreal. - Entirely. We have flown around the world. KERN VALLEY DAY OF ARRIVAL It has been the most amazing journey. When you fly in a small plane, you see the landscape change. It is different from all other means of transport. On large passenger planes you do not get the same feeling. You are in a pressure-regulated cabin and can just pull for - - and sit back. For us, it was the raw feeling of being one with the elements. The cockpit was not pressure regulated and we flew at lower altitudes. And when we landed, flew from place to place - - and met these amazing people - - it was a beautiful painting - - a collage of cultures in which we live - - and where we are connected in a fantastic way. To be able to see it and share that story - in the middle of the amazing adventure I shared with my friend JP - while we flew around in the tiny plane - was without a doubt the greatest adventure of my life. Oh God. This is wild. Holy shit. That was the most surreal thing. It seemed completely unreal. It was as if we had dreamed that we had flown around the earth. That it was only three months ago that we left - - with the whole adventure ahead of us - - and then we came back and all our friends welcomed us - - to congratulate JP on having flown all the way. It was just overwhelming. I felt a pride I had never felt before. It was great to be able to live out my dream - share it with so many people, share that perspective - - and the change I have experienced in my life. It was just pure happiness that we had achieved it. As for the achievements of my life, this is probably the biggest. I was so relieved when the boys finally landed in California. I had a lump in my stomach for months - - and every morning I was waiting for a message that they were okay. So when they were finally back, it was a great feeling. To fly around the world and fulfill the seemingly unattainable dream - - is the most amazing feeling. I am proud of them, and especially of JP. Everyone was so happy to see us and I was overwhelmed. I wanted to grab one, shake him and say: "We just flew around the world in this plane." All the way around the earth. It was probably the first time in my life that I was really proud of myself. One of the greatest lessons was that we humans are - - more connected than we think. That despite the divisions and conflicts we see in the media - are we all just normal people who love our family and friends - - and handles life's challenges. And we do not have time to go to war against each other - - and hating each other because of different beliefs or lifestyles. Today we have the necessary technology - - to cross all mountains and get to all edges of the planet. So we are no longer limited by physical boundaries. We are limited by the view of one culture on the other - - and whether they see people who are different as a threat. Just because someone has a different background - - speaks a different language and has a different skin color - - they do not have to be naughty or your enemies. If you took the time to get to know them - - would you understand that you have more in common than you probably think. If you could bring different people with different religions together - - and faith to understand each other... It's about willingness to understand - - and respect for each other's attitudes or ways of life. We all share the same biosphere, the same air, the same water. What has made us split up? We have always been global, we have always been one. But different stories and environments create different values ​​- - and differences between people. I want to say to people who feel they have to - that they must step in. That was the moment that changed me. Even if it's one in 100,000, it's at least one. And if 100,000 others help one, then we can help everyone. - We've had some hard times. - We have that. If I have a specific wish for this trip and this movie - is it that people should see and appreciate what the world is. Not just the planet, but the people on it and the beauty of everyone. I want people to drop - discrimination and hate and just love each other. I'm so proud of Louis and JP - not just for completing the journey, but sharing people's stories - - and show everyone how beautiful the world is. We humans love to take care of each other - - if we let ourselves focus on that side. Live with people, sit down with people, and hear their stories. We have always been in the same boat. We have always been in the same boat. We have always been in the same boat. We have always been in the same boat. We have always been in the same boat. We have always been in the same boat. We tried to fly around the earth in a single-engine plane, and we succeeded. We would meet with people and see if we are so divided - - as the media often portrays us. We are not. And we do not have to fly around the world to find that unit. You can create it right where you are. One should just listen and love. And if we do, we will not be known as that generation - which are divided along physical and social boundaries - - but one who pays homage to differences and transcends boundaries. An entire generation that truly lives without borders. h
