This is your mother we're talking about. Oh Alice. Sweetheart. (KEITH SIGHING) I wrote the letter, Mr. Wilson. Keith, please. Keith. The letter's not from Morrissey. I wrote it. Sent it with the tickets. I just wanted her to, you know. Don't tell her that. He's all she's got in this fucked up family. You know where to find me, Mr. Keith. What am I gonna do, Marie? Well, you can get some more Smiths tickets. I know it wasn't a roaring success last time. (CLOCK TICKING) Sorry Keith, this is all my fault. I should never have taken her off her depo. It was stupid. It was stupid. You were just trying to help. I don't know what we'd do without you, Marie. You've been a good mate. A crap doctor but a good mate. (CLOCK TICKING) (MARK SINGING SOFTLY) (ALICE CHUCKLING SOFTLY) Dad, sorry, I. Bloody hell. (DOOR SLAMMING) (CLOCK TICKING) What are we gonna do know? Carry on? Right you are.

If she's pregnant, there'll be hell to pay. (MARIE CHUCKLING) What's the time? Half nine. Oh bollocks. Got surgery at 10. I've never heard a doctor say bollocks. Neither have I. Quite impressive actually. (PHONE RINGING) Have a cup of tea and get ready. Got 20 minutes. ALICE: Postscript Books. Time to, if you wanted to that is. All right, sweetheart? Mom's somehow got out of the hospital. (SOFT POIGNANT MUSIC) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) Take the M62 through Manchester. Manchester? Why would she go there? I have a feeling. She asked me about Salford, dad; and she's obsessed by Morrissey and if she wants to find him. That's where he's from. Salford Lads Club, actually. Heard it somewhere. Yeah, but that's... That's what I'd do. Have you never heard of needle and haystack? She's got no money. The police'll pick her up way before that. I love you, dad. You've always looked after us. Now it's my turn. All right well, here. Good luck. Looks like you're gonna need it. (ENGINE REVVING) (KEITH SIGHING) Sorry, God. If you're there, please take care of Gina. She still means a lot to me. And I'm sorry about Marie. But if you do exist, I suspect you're a good bloke with a sense of humor and you'd probably do the same. Amen.

You were all over me like a rash. Oh come on. At least let's have a cup of tea first, eh? Do you wanna have a sausage roll? All right. Blimey, don't get too excited.

Please can we go now? My wish is your command. Where to? Can we go to the Salford? DUNK: The Salford what? Forgotten. Why, what sort of place is it? Do you know Morrissey? Morrissey? Who the hell's Morrissey when he's at home? My savior. I need to get to him. Right. Well, that does sound serious. Very, very serious. He sang to me in my house so I need to get to Manchester. Well I live in Manchester. Are you gonna take me? Okay. All right, can I just drink this? Come on, let's go. (ENGINE REVVING) MARK: She's finally dead. Better call your dad. ALICE: We can get a bus tomorrow. We can't stop looking. NEWSCASTER: We adopted our position. I suppose it'll be all right there for one night. Usually park it at the compound but tonight's a special occasion. If I knew I was gonna have company, I'd have tidied up a bit as well. No, I like it. Gina, you're a bit barmy, aren't you? Suppose so. You got any family round here? No. I don't want to talk. Well, I know how you feel. You tell me when you want to. Hey, you know that, the Salford whatever. Maybe it's a pub. We'll go and have a look for it tomorrow. Yeah. How do you like your eggs? Fried or fried? - Runny please. - Runny ones. (GINA CHUCKLING) All right, runny coming up. (KETTLE WHISTLING) (YAWNS) I heard the phone go. Was that the police? No, just Marie. Don't you think you should call them? See what's happening? They can't keep going to Salford. Maybe she's not in Salford. She is, I'm sure. Let's just let the police do their job. But they need badgering. Get on to them. Anyone would think you don't want to find her. How do you what I want, eh? Ever since you were born, I've looked after her. Me. No one knows what I want. Morning. Mark's here. I hope you didn't get up to anything. Pot, kettle, black. Point taken. Oh, this came for you. If it's what I think it is. (ENVELOPE TEARING) A Morrissey t-shirt. Thanks dad. Seems a bit stupid now. I ordered it a while ago. That's not just a Morrissey t-shirt. It's a ticket. That will get you in to the Morrissey gig in Blackpool. Blackpool? Thanks dad. Love you. Aww, I knew you'd be made up. Sorry about this. The maelstrom of emotions that come with living in this house. See. Sorry, just well. My mom and what happened last time with Nan. Bad timing. I tried to get another one for what's his face here but they're as rare as hen's teeth. So it'll just be you and Morrissey and 2000 other people. Their lead singer, Morrissey, is playing this month up here in Blackpool and get this: allowing anyone free entry to the gig as long as they have a Smiths t-shirt. That's right, any Smiths t-shirt will do. If you are with it and down with the teenagers or perhaps even a teenager yourself, then you would have heard of The Smiths. No, not the brand of crisps but the popular music combo who have been wowing audiences up and down the country with their popular brand of indie music. Hits such as "Their Charming Man" and "Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now." Well if you're a fan, you don't need to remain miserable any longer. DUNK: You finished? Yeah. - Mm-hmm. - Okay. Oh Gina, love. You gotta give me something, you know. Look, I can't just let you stay here if I don't know nothing about you. Now, have you got any family I can contact? I don't wanna talk about Gina, she's fucked. Can we stay here, Dunk? I like it. It's near Morrissey. Look, what about your illness? You know you're a bit half cut, don't you? I mean you may do on my Valium for a bit but it's not the answer. (BOTH CHUCKLING) I like you, Dunk. Oh, you're a funny one. All right. Let's try and get you sorted out, yeah? Look at the state of you honestly. I'm gonna take you shopping tomorrow, yeah? Go shopping? Yeah. Right. Let's have a beer, make a list. Then I'm gonna give you a bath, all right? Reminds me of my dear old girl, that does. On a more serious topic, gamma radiation. (PHONE RINGING) Hello, Postscript Books. Keith Wilson speaking. Hello. Listen, you don't know me mate, but I've got your Mrs. staying with me at the moment. Oh god. Can you put her on? No, she's not here. Well, she doesn't wanna speak to you. I'm phoning 'cause I thought you might be worried. She's told me a bit about what's been going on and I got your number from the directory inquiries. Listen, listen, mate. She's ill, she needs to come home. Well she doesn't want to. She says that she's happy here. Look, I just wanted to let you know she's all right. And she is, she's all right. (PHONE BEEPING) And look, I've gotta go; me money's running out. No, please. Please don't hang up; I need to. (PHONE BEEPING) Oh shit. (DOORBELL RINGING) ANNOUNCER: This is the last call for 223. WOMAN: Ooh, sorry. Wish you were coming. What, do see that poof?

Don't worry about your mom. I'm sure she's okay. (SOFT PIANO MUSIC) Come on trouble. Hey, hey, you need it. You'll be cold. Nah. I'm seeing Morrissey. Yes, you are. See you later! Bye!

(SOFT POIGNANT MUSIC) (GINA WEEPING) Don't close them. We're coming in. Wait! GINA: No, Morrissey! ALICE: We're coming in. You, maybe. Not her. She was mugged and they knicked her t-shirt. Think she goes round this normally? Yeah, nice try, darlin'. Well, it's true. Why don't you be a good daughter, love, and give her yours? Oh fuck off! Alice! Fuck you! Alice! Why can't you be fucking normal? It has to be you, doesn't it? It's always you. When's it my time? When do I get to be something? Do something without you. Please, your shirt. I want to see Morrissey. Fuck! (GINA CHUCKLING) Right. If you want. Let's get this on, yeah? (GINA CHUCKLING) (SOFT POIGNANT MUSIC) Morrissey. ALICE: Sat outside listening to it for a second time. MARK: In your bra? Nice. ALICE: You wish. Oh, I had a coat on. She seemed happy when she came out. Normal. We hugged and she left. No worry. Didn't seem to have missed me and dad much. MARK: Did you miss her much though really? (BIRDS CHIRPING) You're right. A lot of the time I suppose I hadn't missed her. But she's still my mom. Sorry about you missing Morrissey again. It's okay. Come on. Thanks. (CHAIR SMASHING) Dad, what the hell is going on? I'll make tea. Just had that bloody Dunk bloke on the phone again. Says Gina wants a divorce. They wanna get married. Spoke to your mam as well. She seemed happy. Well she has just seen Morrissey. (KEITH WEEPING) It's all right, dad. Don't cry dad, please. We can get her back. Don't cry dad. I'm sorry, sweetheart. I don't know if I want her back. It's been so bad for so long. There's nothing left. I've got nothing left. I'm happy for her but I don't know this guy. Well it's her choice now. She still has a choice. Of course. (SHEEP BLEATING) So what's going to happen? I've asked them to visit. Oh my god. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY ) Weird, eh? Sugar, Keith? Just one.

(BOTH CHUCKLING) (DUNK CHUCKLING) Come on, Princess. (SOFT POIGNANT MUSIC) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (DUNK SPEAKING FAINTLY) Please come inside for a chat, Gina. Is that all right? Kettle's just boiled. Alice, will you show Dunk round the garden, especially the back. I'll pop inside and check with mom. It's hardly Arling Hall. It'll only take 30 seconds. Oh a pathway to a fabulous land. Yeah, it took a while. Everyone loves a sandwich. Manners really, son. Don't show us up. (BIRDS CHIRPING) It's nice here. Innit peaceful? Is it? I'd always thought it was a bit scrubby and scruffy. Like your mom. (CHUCKLES) Oh, I'm sorry. I don't mean to be rude, love. But your mom, she's a bit of a one off, isn't she? You know I love her to bits, don't ya? I know this is a terrible thing to say about my own mom but doesn't she... What, get on me nerves? Revolt me, depress me? I've been asked all them, you know. Nosy buggers at the pub and at the depot. (SIGHS) I don't judge too much on appearances. Your mom, she makes me laugh. She doesn't judge me and I'm not exactly catch of the year myself, am I? She reminds me of me own mom. She were a bit weird and all. Just get used to it. She pleases herself. You know, sometimes she didn't come home for a week. Just gotta learn to live with it. Sorry, your mom. Well this new treatment, it's really helping. KEITH: Tea's up. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Keith, where can I wash me hands? Just use the kitchen. Lads, come on. Come on. (SOFT GENTLE MUSIC) We have a situation. Gina, are you sure this is what you want? Yes. Why don't we just give it a try? Marie? Same as you, Keith. Gina, you seem quite happy with the situation. Is that right? (GINA MUMBLING) (SPEAKS FAINTLY) Gina. (SOFT GENTLE MUSIC) Don't worry about her, please. That's my job now, okay? I'll call. (ENGINE REVVING) (HORN BLARING) (TRUCK BEEPING) It's gonna take a while. (ALICE CHUCKLING) (SHEEP BLEATING) Well? I don't know what to say. Me neither except I liked him. Do you think he can cope with her bad temper, her manners? Her personal hygiene, her swearing, her laziness. (CHUCKLES) But what did you think? I liked him. I can smell a Victoria sponge from two miles. Nearly got run over by a bloody great juggernaut. Thought they were building a bypass? That were Gina and her new man. Crikey, Keith. Not a break in the voice or a nervous tick? How did it go? - Fine. - Fine. Can I have a slice? (SOFT GENTLE MUSIC) (SHEEP BLEATING) Hi. Fancy a walk? There's something I want to tell you about. What?
