Nobody. Never again. No. Fears. Four. Joy. One. Tension. Five. I have good news for you. The previously imposed punishment and therapy will be canceled.

I am happy to be back home. It's good to be home again. Come here. Hey, I'm here to get Micky. - No. - Why not? I have already explained that, that is not possible. One more time, please. No. My son will do that from now on. Bye. New people have also moved in next door. Stay off your fingers. That girl walked Mick every night. I'll be happy when we're out of here. Yes, my Micky. Stop, you are tickling too hard. Mick! Come here! Come back! Come on! Forgive me. Thanks for letting me come back. No problem, boy. Everyone deserves a second chance. And you, for sure. Come on, rinse off. Hey. What is it? Come on. Come on, I'll untie you. What have they done? Quiet. Here. What is that? Wait, I'm coming. Hey! 3 kg 900. It is only for a while. Whenever possible, I'll put you back. I'm going to help you. And you are going to help me. Be ready early next Wednesday, maybe we can go to the new apartment? You haven't seen it yet. Is there still corn? In the closet. Why? For that fish? Elke, come. Mommy has to go to work. Stop it. No, I stay where I am. Come on, it is enough. - I do not care about that. - Come here. Come here. It is always the same. I'll be home tomorrow. Elke! - What is it? - I want to go along. - You can come tomorrow. - You are lying. Get out, it is enough. Give me a kiss. Do you still love me?

What do you think? A fresh start. It'll be fine. I'm sure. Why was I never allowed to visit you there? Jonathan, look at me. Why did you never call back? Because I was ashamed, Mommy. I'm sorry I screwed up like this. It's okay. Hello fish. How are you? Everything is fine with me. What did you eat? I ate cutlets. Hey. How do you get in here? Through the door. I want you to leave. Is it true that you have been in prison? Why? Why did you go to prison? Are you interested in that? - Yes. - I want you to leave. I want you to leave. Get out of my room. Now. Not so hard. You are hurting me. Dirty Bastard. - What was she doing in your room? - I do not know. Jonathan? I don't know what she was going to do here. You have to believe me. I believe you. You have to get more among people. People of your own age. You are too much on yourself. That is not good. And you shouldn't be too concerned with that fish. A fish is not a person. - Is your mom at home? - No. Someone else? Try to stand up straight. Hold this. I want lemonade. Yes. I want more. No. What is your name actually? Elke. But I think that is a very stupid name. - My name is Jonathan. - I know that. I like berry better. Then I will call you Bes. Look. That is from the past. I fell during the swimming lesson. Since then I don't dare to swim anymore. What's your fish's name? It has no name. It is actually a very rare one. A tench. People... Many people believe it has powers. Cures. Then you have to touch it and you will get better. Could it heal my knee? Maybe yes. When I touch it. - Come on, go home. - Can I see the fish? - No, go home. - Tomorrow? Can you stand? Stand up. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Eleven. Twelve. Thirteen. Fourteen. Hey! Too small, hey! Too small. Don't worry about it. Besides, you haven't done anything wrong. Otherwise they wouldn't have acquitted you. That's true. Mick? Mick! Hey, you shouldn't be standing there. - Why not? - That is private. Stop. You have to pay. Why? 1 Euro. No, really. 1 Euro. Yes, come on in, you're already in the kitchen. This is my pet club, home made. This is the living room. And this here is the bathroom with bath. And this is the bedroom. Come on, lie down. Come on. Come on. Lie down. Really, lie down. The animals, Jonathan. Jonathan, the animals. That there is Luigi, the owl. This one here is Louise, the rabbit. And there is Rick, the dog. And those there have been punished. They think you are rude because you don't say anything back. - What should I say? - Just hello. Hey. They all say hello back except M. Krab, he thinks you're weird. - Yes, Mick. - No, wait, don't leave yet. They say you can come back. We shall see. No one ever comes here. Tomorrow is Friday. Then you have that appointment? With the psychologist. Do you hear me? - Answer me! - Yes, yes. - Yes, sir? - A schnitzel, please. - Anything else? - No, thank you. Here you go. Voil√†. - Eat it. - And you? I'm going to eat later. Mmm. Chnitzel. - Schnitzel. - Chnitzel. I saw a dried out worm today. He stuck to a fence. And when I saw that worm, I thought about you. And what did you think? That I was very sorry for that worm. I dreamed your fish was dead. That will not happen. I take good care of that. What is its favourite food? It likes to eat deep snails. Or corn, or dog food. Stop that. What? You shouldn't do that. - Why not? - Because that's rude. I don't think what my mom says is true. I think you're sweet. I know, I have to go home. Thank you for the food. You're welcome. Seven. Five. It's not allowed, I know. What should I do? What should I do? I will not let her in again. Just make sure she doesn't get too close. Two meters away. - Does it hurt here? - Yes. I think I saw Vera today. - Really? - In the shop. That's impossible. She no longer lives here. Maybe someone who looks like her? Yeah, sure. Thank you. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Two meters. Two meters. Those are weird snails. - Just give one. - Really? It does not eat it. You have to be a little patient. It is not hungry. Look. Stay! Stop. That is pathetic.. No, he has to wait. Stop it, bastard! Well done. Mommy says you're all bastards. Who? My dad. I called him. He says he is sorry. He always asks me where we live now, but I'm not allowed to say that about mom. - You really can't aim! - You do? Yes. Bes? Bes, where are you? Bes, I don't see you. There you are! Open your mouth. Sit still. Is it finished? That hurts? What? I don't feel anything. And now? And now? No. You lie, I can see it in your eyes. I'm just very strong. Don't look at me like that. Almost finished! Rocket ship. Moon. Pray. Rocket ship. Moon. Pray. You have to raise your legs higher. I'm like a frog. Yes, just keep going. Pray. Rocket ship. Rocket ship. Moon. Pray. Look at me, I'm going to get on my knees, then I'm the same size as you. Then you can see how deep it is. That's funny, isn't it? One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Count with me. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Okay. - We calmly sink into the water. - I'm afraid. You shouldn't be afraid, I'm holding you. You're doing very well. Yeah, good. A little deeper. Okay, very good. I'm going to grab your stomach now and we're going to make a plank like we learned. Very well. I'm holding you, trust me. I'm holding you. Calm down. I'm holding you. Okay. We will try again. Quiet. Just hold me. It's okay. Just lie quietly, do nothing, do not move. Very well. Pray. Rocket ship. Moon. Pray. Rocket ship. Moon. Pray. Stop. It is enough. Where are you going? The class is finished. We have only just started. How's your mind? Good. Only sometimes... Sometimes I am afraid. Afraid of? Is something wrong? No. But you say you are afraid, what are you afraid of? Afraid of myself. Afraid of my thoughts. And what do you think? That I don't want to be like that. I understand. But it's just thoughts. Do not forget that. You have thoughts. But you are not. It's actually... teaching and unlearning. Unlearn and replace. Replace one thought with another. Yes. Unlearn and replace. Unlearn and replace. Learning and unlearning. Learning and unlearning. Learning and unlearning... Unlearning. Learning. Unlearning. Hey. It is better that we stop seeing each other for a while. What are you saying now? I'm sorry, girl. It's just better that we don't see each other again. I can't, I need you, and you need me. Is that right? Yes. It's not allowed. What have I done? Nothing. I do not understand. You shouldn't understand it. You just have to stay as far away from me as possible. We wanted to get snails, you promised. Close it again, baby. Close up. What is it? Bad day. Come on. Are you going to paint in there? Yes. - Don't you have anything else with you? - No. Wait. Thank you. There will soon be a party. Don't feel like going along? No, not really. It's Saturday. I think I might go fishing. I'm coming along. Want to fish? Yes, why not? One. Three. Yes, turn, turn. Turn! Other side! Yes. Okay. Hold it once? That's a beautiful animal. Mirror carp. It is a young mirror carp. - Put it back in the water? - Yeah, put it back. Well done. - What are you doing? - Come on, it's awesome. You chase all the fish away. Come on! Here, your fish. Come on, it's awesome. Come on out. Come on. Sorry... Hey! Away! Away! Away! You destroy everything. Stupid beasts! Happy because... Sad because... Afraid because... Angry because... 3 kilos 100. - It has lost weight. - I know. - Are you out of snails? - I have to get new ones. Fish, where are you going? The water is gone and you are tired. You are so soft and you are so smooth. I'd like to have you with me because that makes me happy. Say, you still have to swear, right? What do I swear? You can only join the club if you swear allegiance to the rules. The rules? From the animal club. 1. You should always be kind to each other. 2. You should never be mean. 3. You should never exclude them or tell them they stink. 4. You should never drink or hit or rant. You have to swear. So... with your fingers between your teeth and then spit. So? I can do it myself. Of course. Jonathan? What is it? What is it? Get dressed. - Are you in the bathroom? - Almost done. Hurry! - What is it? - Quiet! You have to be quiet. Put on your shoes. Wait. I'm finished. What is this? Answer! Say something! That was in the bath. What does this mean? Nothing. I am not blind. I know she was in your room. I'm sure. Yeah, she's been here. She's 9, Jonathan, she's still a child. Nothing has happened. I want it to stop, it has to stop. It just has to stop. Do you understand? Stop. It has to stop. Not again. - Nothing has happened. - I want it to stop. Nothing has happened. - Elke? - Daddy, how do you know that? Elke! When will I see you? Elke. I want to go to school. I don't want you to call him. I want to see my dad. - That is not possible. - You are a stupid mama. I am not stupid. Yes, you only think of yourself. What did he say? I don't talk to you anymore. Go inside. - I hate you. - You don't talk to me like that. I do not care about that. I hate you, I hate you. Do you think it is better with your father? Then leave! Bes? Come on, I'm going to take you home. I don't want to go home. - Where do you want to go? - Nowhere. I want to go to my daddy, to Brussels. To Brussels? This is a long way. So? I'll hitchhike. Maybe you should ask that gentleman if he is going to Brussels? Or you can also watch TV with me? Get off. - We wanted to watch TV. - That is not possible now. You promised it. I am sorry, but that is not possible now. Tomorrow. Go to sleep now. Go to sleep. No, not alone. Come with me. Okay, until you sleep. You have one more story to tell me. I don't know any stories. - Then tell something about the past. - No, no. What kind of person are you? I forgot that. I don't remember that. Sorry, when I'm with you I always say things I don't want to say. Like? When you ask a question I always feel that I have to answer honestly. Just say it. I used to be a monster. Wow! A big horrible monster - with long fingers and long toes. - No really. A monster with very long ears. It's not funny. - Are you going to eat me? - Don't! Sleep tight. You are not a monster. Sleep tight. What are you doing? Be quiet. Please. Just be quiet. Just lie still. Do not move. Be quiet. I just want to watch. I'm just going to watch. - Do not move. - You scare me. I shouldn't have come here. Forgive me. I'm not like that. Forgive me. I forgive you. - Where have you been? - I could not sleep. I have to leave. Dirty dirty guy. Sorry, but I have to ask you to leave. You don't have to come back tomorrow either. You better take care of her. What are you talking about? About your daughter. You should take better care of your daughter. - What do you mean? - That you don't take good care of her. Are you going to tell me how to raise my child? I'll know. I am her mother. Is that possible? Do you call yourself a mother? Do you have a mother heart? Idiot! I love her. I take time for her. I take care of her. A letter has arrived. I don't want to know, Mommy. They are going to reopen the investigation. Vera has given a new testimony and you must register within 5 days. Is there anything I should know? Then tell me, otherwise I can't help. There is no point. - It makes no sense. - You do not know. I know that. We must not give up. But mama, I'm like that. I can not change. And you know that too. Stay. Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. Two. Two.
