Enjoy the Flick ! Fixed & Synced by aLDEN India and Pakistan have fought four battles. 1947,1965, 1971 and 1999 But very few people know that there was another battle which was fought. Far away under the sea. 1971 When Bangladesh was known as East Pakistan. For the first time, the roots of tyrant west Pakistan, seemed to be loosing their roots in the east. The rebellion by the Bengali Nationalist revolutionaries was on a all time high. Agitated by their Guerilla Army 'Mukti Bahini' the Pakistani government launched 'Operation Searchlight'. Soon the roads of Dhaka, Chittagong, Sylhet, Khulna and Jessore were soaked in blood. Millions of east Pakistani refugees entered the borders of India expecting help. Now India and Pakistan's attitude towards each other started getting sterner. But Pakistan's approach was clear. Any Bengali who were suspected of being Nationalists or their supporters. The Pakistani army would drag them out of their homes and kill them. Hello! this is All India Radio, Delhi. I am Anand Trivedi." And now for the main headlines. Tension and violence continues to build in East Pakistan. Pakistan's President Yahya Khan has said... that the opposition groups are getting open support from India. In return, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi clarified that India has no association with the internal conflicts of its neighboring country. But if Pakistan decides to take any military action then our armies are capable of giving a fitting reply. Papa, if there's a war will you have to go? No, dear. You just heard. This is between East Pakistan and West Pakistan. And Vizag is miles away. We have nothing to fear. Mr. President's instructions are absolutely clear. We cannot not lose hold on the radicals in East Pakistan. Sir, for that our armies must keep getting continuous supplies. This is exactly why I was summoned. We have a geographical disadvantage. East Pakistan is landlocked by India from all three sides. Sending supplies by road ways is impossible. By air, the supplies will be insufficient. And anyway, we'll have to enter Indian airspace. In this situation we have only one option left. The sea-route. All the way up here. We can tackle the Indian fleet, but, INS Vikrant! You know, The elephant of their sea. 21 aircrafts, Sea-Hawks, Aleez, the French Anti-submarine jet. Long range rocket launchers. And with all that, INS Vikrant can block this entire area. Sinking it is very important. It's not going to be easy. I never said it would be. And that's why we must send our best team. Depute Razzak And if he fails in sinking INS Vikrant, then, we must bring plan B into action. Where we'll launch a surprise attack on any one of the Indian ports. They will shift their focus on defending that port, and open up a sea-route for us. Mrs. Gandhi has said. - Sir! Give it to Raman sir. The intercepted message has been decoded. "Keep 2075TH hydraulic oil in ample quantities." 2075TH Hydraulic oil? But it's used only in specialized naval vessels. When was this message sent? 36 hours back, sir. Karachi to Chittagong. Chittagong? The obvious targets are Paradip, Visakhapatnam, Madras and Port Blair. And if that's the case, then they will launch a surprise attack. Swift and from the high sea. We must keep an eye on this area, sir. What is the vessel status out there? All deployed sir... except S21. Send it immediately for recce operation. But sir, S21 is under Capt. Rann Vijay Singh's command. And you know him pretty well. We don't have time. We cannot afford another Dwarka. S21 must sail for search. We've no choice. If enemy presence is detected in this search operation. then Capt. Rann Vijay Singh will not wait for orders before attacking. Sir, it will trigger a war. Where is Lt. Commander Arjun? 500 kms from Visakhapatnam Port. 80 degrees east. 600 nautical miles down. This is our area of operation. Sir, what are my orders sir? Capt. Rann Vijay Singh, your mission will be passive. This is just a search operation. If you detect enemy presence, you must report back. And wait for further instructions. And if I come face-to-face with the enemy. do I 'still' report back, wait for your instructions? Yes! headquarters will instruct you what to do next. You have to follow the orders. Lt. Commander Arjun will be with you. The Mission's called 'Operation Sea-Sight'. And this is a classified mission. Sir, if I see, - Remember, we're still not at war. Understand? This is only a recce mission. We've to wait and watch. 00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:44,549 Don't worry, I'll be back soon. Finally we're going to be blessed with this bundle of joy. Do you have to go? Its duty I must go. And we must tell him my stories of bravery too. Love you. Bye. Sorry. Good morning, sir. How's your wife doing, Devaraj? - Fine, sir. The due date is in four days. Oh, that's good. Yes sir. By the way, sir... how long do we have to wait? Officer Arjun is coming. Look Arjun, we all know Rann Vijay Singh very well. And we've strict instructions. Under no circumstances do we attack first. And that's your responsibility. Sir. Pankaj, how are you? - Fine. I See. Where is your officer by the way? - He's on his way. We're almost ready to go, sir. But we can't leave. Political. Our officer is coming, you see. So we wait, and wait, wait. Iqbal. - Ramsagar. How are you? - Hello. You're their benefactor until we all come back. Apologies for the delay, sir. - No problem. He's Devaraj. Executive officer. - Hello, sir. Second in command. - Sir. The orders are in your lockers. - Okay. These are the keys. Your mission goes as planned. The torpedo key. I hope you won't need it. Sir. Cyclone forecasted, sir. Between longitude 85 and latitude 76. Fantastic. So the enemy won't come that way. And if they do show up. Then they won't go back. Okay, boys. Check vents. All marked, sir. - Okay. Depth test. - Successful, sir. How is everything? All set, sir. Ready to dive. Okay. Let's submerge the boat. - Aye, sir. All compartments, prepare to dive. Diving in one minute. Crew, alert and at your positions. Switch, diesel to battery! All batteries are running, sir. Half ahead two, dive to forty meters. Aft. 5 degrees. - Aye, sir. Half ahead two, dive to forty meters. With 5 degrees aft bubble. Sir, half ahead two. two going half ahead, sir. Dive to 40 meters with 5 degrees aft bubble. Sir. What's this, Surya? For drying clothes, I guess. Underwear. For drying underwear. Only if you wash them this year. How can you dry clothes on this shaky line? Son, this 'shaky line' will tell us how deep we've dived in the water. You didn't get it? Come here, let me explain you. Training kit for amateurs. I always keep it handy. Oh, God! Think of this egg as the submarine. And the entire ocean above it. Not just this the entire ocean. According to the design, the S21 can dive up to 250 meters. Rumors say that it can go to 300. But no one's ever dived that deep. Can you imagine the pressure of water on the submarine at that depth? How much? 200,000 tons. All systems are running fine, sir. Fantastic. Conduct emergency drill. Now, sir? - Yes, why? The crew hasn't completely settled in, sir. Yes, of course. Before breaking your jaw. the enemy would like to know whether you brushed your teeth, or not. Whether we've settled down or not? Conduct the drill. Sir. Action stations! Action stations! Action stations! This is a drill. I repeat, this is a drill. 7th compartment, auxiliary pipe leaking. Careful. Not like that. Fix it manually. Come on hurry up. Get the jack. Where is the jack? Hold it tight. Fire in the battery unit. Done. Done. Done. Compartment 4 fire in the battery unit, fix it. It's stuck, get the hose-pipe from the 7th compartment. Fast! Fast! Fast! Pull, Hurry up. You're not even fit to row a boat. Bungling buggers! Sir give them some time, sir they will fit in. Don't tell me what to do and when to do it. Terminate this drill and train their bottoms off. Yes, sir. - Didn't hear you. Yes, sir. - Didn't hear you. Yes, sir. - Didn't hear you. Yes sir! He was suspended for two years for this tyrant behavior. He slapped two of his subordinates. He hasn't changed yet. Those who he slapped... ...also won medals later. Capt. Rann Vijay always does what's right. He's always right. Goodnight, Arjun. Sir. Radio message. Order to reach a location, sir. Our first mission, gentlemen. Let's toast to that. General Patton. Every soldier's role model. They even made a movie on him. It won the Oscar this year. Did you see it? I didn't see the film sir, but I think General Patton was too aggressive. He was aggressive. That's why he was successful. Battles are won by killing the enemy...and not by dying. Cheers! Yes. - Sir, we got the message. Everything's proceeding as planned. Razzak is on his way. - Good. Sir, this entire area is clear. Sir, no sonar contact in this area either. Sir, we've had no sonar contacts anywhere. Shall we consider 'Operation Sea-Sight a success? Move aside, move! Good news everyone. Our first mission is a success. Prepare to head home. Brighten up, you can go home and get married now. We'll start celebrating right here, from hell. We'll have a ball. We're keeping a close watch, sir. Yes, sir. yes, sir. Sir. Mr. Girish Kumar from RAW. He has information for us. Hello. - Hello. Sir, I've classified information. The Director gave me special instructions that I must convey this message to you personally. Sir, our trusted sources in Karachi have confirmed that, Pakistan Navy has launched an offensive mission against India. What is their target? That's not confirmed yet. But according to our sources, it can be Vikrant. We know that submarine Ghazi has set sail from Karachi for this mission. Commander Razzak is leading. Thank you. Indian Navy will be ready for the counter operation. I am sure, sir. Thank you. Jai Hind, sir. Ghazi. Their most decorated submarine. In '65 Ghazi alone gave cover to all the Pak naval vessels. Speed, range, endurance, armament! The Indian submarines cannot equal Ghazi in any respect. And a Commander like Razzak. Sir, the coordinates we received were wrong. INS Vikrant is not on these coordinates. It's just an Indian merchant ship. The information doesn't have to be wrong. No! The enemy can be swift. Who knows maybe the Indians changed Vikrant's course. Sir, now? Initiate plan B. - Yes, sir... But before that, we must divert the Indian Navy's attention. Yes, sir. Sir. Strange echoes. What's wrong? - Sir, something's wrong. We can hear strange echoes. Periscope depth. Go to periscope depth. Blow aft tank and forward tank. Quick. Depth 20 meters. 15 meters. Periscope depth maintaining depth nine meters, sir. Bloody cowards! Sir, survivors. Anything in the sonar range? - No, sir. Surface the boat. - Aye, sir. Surfacing the boat. Turn off the engine. - Yes, sir. Check the surroundings. - Aye, sir. Radio room come in. Sir, Radio room to Control room. Message headquarters, Indian Merchant ship sinking. Aye, sir. Sir. Damn. Hold it. Merchant ship. Our enemy is not such a coward. Why merchant ship? Sir, no enemy presence. Come again, Devaraj. Presence of the enemy not detected, sir. That doesn't mean that the enemy doesn't exist, Devaraj. Close that hatch and prepare to dive. - Sir. But officer Arjun is outside. - What? He jumped in to save some civilians. Oh my bleeding heart. Emotional bloody fools. Sonar come in. - Sonar to control room, sir. Is there anything in the vicinity of 500 meters? Negative, sir. - Roger. Devaraj. Sir, - We've precisely 90 seconds. After that we'll be target practice for the enemy. On the 91st second, we close the hatch and we dive. That's a bloody order! Yes, sir. Throw the lifebuoy. Hurry up. No, sir. Don't go. Sir, orders to dive immediately. Taan Singh, careful. - Sir. Diving in 30 seconds. Sir. Sir, we've clearance. We can move ahead. Kamlakar, take her in. - Sir. My beautiful Bengal, I adore you. Forever and ever, I've been. Ma'am, this is the Indian Navy. You're safe here. Kamlakar, please take her in. - Sir Dive! Dive! 100 meters! Let's find this enemy and bury him into the ground, Devaraj. Aye, sir. - Sir, we cannot attack without clearance. I forgot...your government clearance. How many more lives of soldiers does your 'Clearance policy' want? You know what, make a beautiful bouquet. out of your bloody 'Clearance policy' and send it to Islamabad. Along with the uniforms of our martyred soldiers. Gift. Listen, Mr. Officer. I am not going to wait anymore for this clearance business. Okay? If it comes, fine. If not...I'm going to find my enemy and I am going to kill him. Sir, we act on conformation and not assumptions. Sir, radio message. - How can we say that this was an act of the enemy? And not an accident. Anything can be responsible for the blast. Explosives. Inflammable cargo. Sir, we can't act on your instincts. This is my bloody sub! Nobody tells me what to do. Sir, message. Dive to 40 meters and hold. Yes, sir. Devaraj. - Sir. Just, just hold till the bloody enemy kills you. Because that's the order. Useless politics. Dive to 40 meters. - Aye, sir. Depth 40 meters, holding sir. We're both refugees. But, why were you singing your rebel anthem? We thought you're Pakistanis, that's why. They can't tolerate our rebel anthem. They shoot immediately. You mean you wanted to commit suicide. At least that way I could've saved our honor. Hi. Congrats, Father Devaraj. How do you... - Ranjan has already broadcasted this news over the entire submarine. Thank you. Here. Congratulations. - Thank you. Your child is very lucky to be born on this side of the border. Hey... Here. Your happy birthday? - No... My child he's still very young. Just born today. Until now we've been here, here and at this point. And the ship was destroyed here. Their intentions are something else. Sir. It's a boy. Congratulations! - Thank you, sir. Congratulations! - Thank you. Thank God your wife didn't keep your son on hold. Like our government. Devaraj. - Sir. Don't let this divert your attention. We still have a lot to do. - Absolutely not, sir. Diversion. That's it. - I didn't get it, sir. This merchant ship was a diversion. They wanted us to focus entirely on this area. This means their target is something else. On the east coast there's Paradip. Madras. Visakhapatnam. Visakhapatnam! Target is Visakhapatnam! Plot all coordinates to Vizag. Let's move west immediately. Aye, sir. Rajiv. Did you clean your ears too? - Sorry, sir. Check 10 degrees west. - Sir' No contact, sir. Change frequency 10 degree west. Aye, sir. Negative, sir. Further change frequency, 10 degrees west. - Aye, sir. Sir. sonar contact! One. Two. Three... Four. Seven. Eight. Nine. Sir, confirming contact at 2000 meters... bearing red 750, center 900. - Fantastic! Keep tracking. - Yes, sir. Devaraj. - Yes. The sonar spotting has been done. 2000 meters. We dive 250...7 degree aft bubble. Heading west and we torpedo the enemy. Sir. we must stay on hold until our orders don't change. Rann Vijay Singh doesn't wait for any orders, and you know that. The enemy's been spotted...and he shouldn't be there. That's my rule. And everyone on this submarine follows my rule. I've been sent here to follow the Indian Navy's rules, sir. Not yours. Look Arjun, this is no time for class room theory. Radio's down enemy presence has been confirmed. In such a situation, it's the captain's call. I am the captain. It's my call that we head west, full speed. Sir you're the senior naval officer. You know that the discipline of the armed forces is our identity. That's the difference between us and the rogue forces. One small mistake can lead to an Indo-Pak war. And 650 million civilians will have to pay for it. And sir, you cannot fire without joint orders, sir. Sir. He's right. According to the rules, I cannot proceed without your joint orders. So you want to play 'rules'? Fine. You need both our permission to fire torpedoes, don't you? Yes, sir. - How sad. Sad! And do I need anyone's permission to conduct a drill? No, sir. Well then let's dive 250. aft 7 degrees, heading west. Since we've found the enemy, let's wrap up 'Operation Sea-Sight'. So let's torpedo the enemy. But Devaraj, I don't want you to be... What is that you said? Rogue force. This is an emergency practice drill. Yes, sir. Action stations! Action stations! Action stations! This is an emergency drill. I repeat, this is an emergency drill. This is an emergency drill. Dive to 250 meters. Boat depth 170 meters. What you're doing isn't right, sir? I am just following S21 rules. Taan Singh. - Sir. Prepare to launch torpedo, tube no. 1. - Sir. Key, sir. Sir, you know this is wrong. I can only follow rules. And according to the rules, it's my duty to implement the captain's orders during a drill. Please. Sir. Torpedo in tube no. 1...ready to fire, sir. Depth 240 meters, sir. Attention all stations, this is your captain. Gentlemen, don't ever forget this moment. Not every soldier lives to see this day. Victory. Victory is something that will never be handed to you. You have to fight for it. Which is exactly what we're going to do now. I know... some of you are scared, wondering whether this is war, or just a drill. Think of life as a drill. and you won't be scared anymore. So gentlemen, all stations alert. This is your captain. Over and out! Depth 250 meters, sir. Get ready. 3. 2. 1. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Sir, torpedo alert. Red bearing 270 degrees. Be alert everyone, take positions. - Yes, sir. Sir, the torpedo is at 300 meters. Nine. But sir, it's not on target. Navigation, come in. - Navigation, copy sir. Turn the boat 30 degrees starboard. Full speed ahead. - Aye, sir. Sonar, report contact. Sir no contact, sir. Do they know about our presence? Why else would they waste a torpedo? How far off was it? 200 meters, sir. That's not far. This means someone in there is racking his brains. Hold same depth. What's the range of correction? 200 meters, sir. Maybe the enemy knows that we fired a torpedo. We're right behind them! Which means we can only see their tail, that's why we didn't hit the target. Now, if we dive 50 meters more. Somewhere here. Then our target area will be their entire base. And...we knock the enemy off. And they won't be able to detect us. - No, sir. Dive to 300. 300, sir? Yes! 300. Are you sure? - I am very sure! Devaraj. - Sir. I said dive to 300 meters. Yes, sir. Dive to 300 meters. Sir. - Dive...to 300 meters. Aye, sir. Sir, you're risking everyone's lives. Program torpedo. Torpedo in tube no. 2 ready to fire, sir. Depth 260 meters, sir. Depth 270 meters, sir. Stay away from the pipes. The bolts can shoot out due to the pressure. Compartment seven, leak in auxiliary pipe! Close aft six and seven vents. Close aft six and seven vents. - Okay. Report damage. Compartment seven, report damage. Sir, we need to terminate this drill immediately. Fire...fire... Sanjay, be careful. Continue the dive. Sir, if you don't immediately terminate this drill. then according to contingency rules, I'll have to take over this submarine now. What? - Yes sir, and I will act on it immediately. Surface the boat. The drill has been terminated. Surfacing the boat. I repeat, the drill has been terminated. Surfacing the boat. I said surface the boat! I need the captain's orders, sir. We won't stop diving. Depth 285 meters. Continue the dive. - Go ahead, shoot me. Sir...the kitchen is filled with smoke. We must surface in order to clear it out. Sir, we have to surface. This is an emergency. Please, sir. Sir. Take the boat up. After we clear the smoke. We dive, okay. Empty the tanks. - Aye, sir. Sir, location has been identified. It's an Indian submarine. They are 2000 meters away from us. Bearing green 90 degrees east. Sir, they are currently at this point. And, we are exactly here. At this point. And since we're in Indian naval waters, they will definitely come after us, through these hills. You mean attack. - Of course. But not in their style. Prepare to welcome our Indian guests. With the welcome garlands. Sir. Bashir Khan. Sir. Plant water mines alongside these hills. As soon as the Indians get here they will come in contact with the mines, and Game over. Everything is fine, sir. Ready for action, sir. Yes, sir. His blood boils faster than diesel, sir. You know how to do first aid? I am a doctor. Sir, this is our exact position. If we turn at 80 degrees. - Sir. The Indian submarine is not heading towards us. And why will they. You guys arranged for the welcome wagon but forgot to invite them properly. Let them know where we are. Send clear signals. - Aye, sir. Sister, I am hungry She was hungry, so... Oh we completely forgot about the kid in this emergency. This is for you. There was only one. Officer. Thank you, for saving our lives. This would've never happened... if you had firmly told the captain to follow head-quarter's, Orders. Are all political orders right? - Right or wrong. But following them is our duty. Chandan Singh followed them too orders. The captain's son. In the '65 war he was deputed in the Poonch Sector. They had information about enemy mobilization. All the signs indicated towards an attack at dawn. Chandan sent message to headquarters. "Let's plan a surprise attack at night." He sent messages repeatedly. But head quarter's reply was. "No attack only defense." Three days later. Chandan's dead body came back. His body was riddled with bullets. Later head quarters also sent medals. Devaraj! We won't head back until this Pakistani submarine isn't destroyed. Sir, we, - And you, officer. Stop me if you can. Full speed ahead. - Sir, the consequences. If you point that gun at the captain then I'll arrest you for mutiny. I don't care about getting court-martialed. Okay? Full ahead! - Aye, sir. Sir. Check this. Sonar contact center 900. left 1100, sir. Follow it, Devaraj. Let's chase this Pakistani crocodile. They should not get away. Sir. Sir, communication is broken. We can't even ask for interim provisions. We've very little food left. If we don't eat for a day or two. our poor brave soldiers will die of hunger, huh! How long till we reach port? 26 hours, sir. Let's head back. Inform base about the enemy. Sir. Attention stations! Attention stations! Attention stations! We're heading back to the port. I repeat, we're heading back to the port. Just keep tracking. - Aye, sir. Sir. We were getting echoes from between these hills. And later they faded. It's unusual. And sir, we should check this point as well. It'll take us five hours to get to that point. And another 26 hours to get back to port from there. We've civilians as well as a kid on board. We don't have enough food supplies for everyone. Whatever we have is for the civilians. We won't die if we don't eat for 31 hours. When did he start speaking our language? Are you sure? - Sir, positive. And sir. captain's gun, should remain with the captain. Sir, we should get echoes from port or starboard when we pass through the hills. But we're getting from the center instead. Damn. Devaraj there are mines. It's a trap, change course. Tiwari, change of course, immediately. Come on. Yes, sir. Yes. Sir, mine impact! X 30, bearing green 45, center 70. Yes! Yes! - Hold on. Sonar, please confirm whether. the Indian submarine's been completely destroyed, or not. What happened? This device can locate till the depth of 300 meters. And there's nothing till that depth. Confirmed, there's no signal. The Indian Submarine has sunk. Congratulations, sir. - This is the just the beginning. The conclusion will be when Visakhapatnam. disappears from the face of India's map. Long live Pakistan! Long live Pakistan! Get up. Come on, stand up. Careful. It's alright. it's alright. Are you fine? - Yes, sir. Take him to the cabin. - Okay, sir. We must close the hatch. Sir, come out quickly. This torpedo propeller must be stopped, otherwise the submarine will blow up. Close the hatch, quickly. We must do something, quickly. The torpedo's been fixed... but the water isn't stopping. Come on, come on, come boys. We've no time. Yeah, go on. Good. Now remove the jack. Multiple injuries. Deep incisive wound in the left shoulder. We need to wait until the anesthesia kicks in. Is he fine? Arjun, now you're in command. The entire submarine. Sir. Most of the batteries are damaged. The pressure pumps are broken as well. And the battery room is still filled with water. Get me the S21's blue prints. We'll use the ballast pumps...4-7th. We'll flush out the water from every compartment through the torpedo tube. Pump the water out with high pressure. Go- go- go. - Yes, sir. Quickly-quickly. Here. Move-move.. Guys, hurry up. Quickly-quickly. Sir. Still no contact with S-21. Sir, only two battery units are working. How long will they last? - Hardly 20-25 minutes. After that only the emergency lights will work. And sir, the port's propeller is dislodged as well. Means we can't go back or forth, sir. But we can go up using the compressed gas. Blow all the ballast tanks. - Sir. Apply emergency pressure. Yes. - One moment guys, wait. 380 meters. 360 meters. 350 meters. 340 meters. 330 meters. 300 meters. Yes...come on. Check for mines. - Aye, sir. Has the radio been fixed? Everything's fine in here, sir. Maybe there's a problem with the antenna. Sir, another mine. 40 degrees starboard, 15 degrees. 170 meters depth. 15 degrees starboard... 15 degrees starboard means it's not on our path. We can go up. - Aye, sir. Officer, Devaraj is conscious. Things are in control now. But there's bad news. Our captain. - I know. I saw. He gave us his life while trying to save yours. We must bid him farewell. He who utters the name of Lord rises victorious. He who utters the name of Lord rises victorious. He who utters the name of Lord rises victorious. He who utters the name of Lord rises victorious. He who utters the name of Lord rises victorious. Praise our Lord!" "Praise our Lord! Praise our Lord!" "Praise our Lord! Praise our Lord!" "Praise our Lord! Praise our Lord!" "Praise our Lord! Praise our Lord!" "Praise our Lord! Praise our Lord!" "Praise our Lord! Praise our Lord!" "Praise our Lord! Praise our Lord!" "Praise our Lord! He who is pure at heart will attain victory. He who is pure at heart will attain victory. He wanted to bury the enemy in the sea. But now, he belongs to the sea instead. Attention stations. This is Lt. Commander Arjun Varma. Capt. Rann Vijay Singh was a proud Indian soldier. He knew what it means to be a soldier. What does it mean to be a soldier? The farmers of our nation, are growing crops in their fields, without any fear. Why? Because he knows that we stand guard at the border. At dawn, mothers happily take her kids to school. She has not fear. Why? Because he knows that we stand guard at the border. Every resident of this nation works hard every day. For the future of his family. For the progress of his children. He's never worried about their safety. Why? Because he knows that we stand guard at the border. and we always will. Keeping this faith alive that's what being a soldier means. Remember what the captain always said. Battles are won by slaying the enemy. This is the moment to give his sacrifice a meaning. The enemy's right in front of us and he's got his eyes on our country. He wants to step on our pride and set foot in our country. Will we let it happen? - No, sir. We won't let anyone go back. We'll bury them right here, sir. Even their dead bodies won't go back. We'll bury each one of them in the water. We're with you, sir. We won't go back without avenging our captain's death, sir. This mission is classified. We won't get recognition or medals. Whether history remembers us, or not. but we'll be a part of India's future. Jai Hind! Jai Hind! Jai Hind! Jai Hind! Jai Hind! Jai Hind! Jai Hind! Jai Hind! Jai Hind! Sir. You're senior to officer Arjun. You should be in command. Jadhav. That's not our job to decide. Dismissed. - Sorry, sir, but I can't follow this. You know this submarine better. You've been with our captain longer. - Jadhav, dismissed. Sorry, sir. Headquarters has designated officer Arjun with special powers. It's an order. I accept him as my captain. And so will you. I won't tolerate this insubordination again. Is that clear? - Yes, sir. Dismissed. - Sir. Our submarine can only go up and down. How will we follow them? We'll use their mines on them and they will come looking for us. - Sir. This is our submarine, 200 meters depth. This is the position of the mine, 170 meters. We've to reach 170 meters and destroy this mine. And the enemy will come back on this line. To confirm the damage. And this is our torpedo's position. They will be within our firing range. But sir, we can't wait for too long. Only two batteries are functioning and the torpedoes won't launch without power. We'll generate compressed air manually and fire the torpedoes. Depth 200 meters. Depth 190 meters. 180 meters. 170 meters. - Hold. Holding, sir. Compartment seven crew alert. Hit it Attention crew, on the count of three. One. two. three. Hum! - Hum! Hum! Hum! Hum! Hum! Hum! Hum! Hum! Hum! Hum! Hum! Hum! Hum! Hum! Hum! Sir, another mine blast. But within 20 minutes? That means the Indian submarine wasn't completely destroyed. Sir shall we go check the submarine? or keep heading towards Visakhapatnam? That's always been the problem. Which bug do we crush first? Will they come? Don't know. Yes. Sir, sonar contact. Position. Port 265 degrees west, center 900, sir. Program torpedo. - Aye, sir. Centre 900. Centre 865. Centre 850. It's not too far. Centre 800, sir. You were right. - 780. They are coming in our firing line. Let them come till 700, sir. It will be a sure shot. If the second mine blast was a trick then they must be waiting for us. And first rule of war, never follow the expected line. XO. - Sir, Turn starboard 80 degrees southeast. Sir they changed course. New coordinates, Port 280 degrees. Port 270 degrees. Port 260 degrees. Port 250 degrees. Port 240 degrees. This is their approach line. - 200 degrees, sir. Meaning they are not approaching directly. 180 degrees. The angle of our torpedo is fixed because we cannot turn. And now the enemy is outside our firing angle. But the problem is, now we're in their firing range. Sir, the Indian submarine is at 650 meters but not moving. Load torpedo in tube 1. - Yes, sir. Compartment seven, load torpedo in tube 1. Program torpedo. - Sir, programming torpedo. Torpedo in tube one programmed, sir. Shoot! Sir, they've launched torpedo, sir. Bearing red 50 center 250. Dive to 190 immediately. Dive to 190 meters. - Aye, sir. Diving to 190 meters. Quick! Quick! Quick! Impact in 600 meters. 550 meters. 450 meters, sir. 300 meters. Sir. sir. 80 meters. Sir, the torpedo missed us. Sir, the torpedo missed. What is their current depth? - 200 meters, sir. And still diving down. Bashir, come in. - Bashir, copying sir. Launch two torpedoes. Depth 210 and 260 meters, over. Oh. Sir, torpedo. Bearing red 40...center 210, sir. Sir, our depth? Fine, we can dive. Sir, they've launched another torpedo. Bearing red 40 center 260. It's at a variation of 50 meters. Reverse direction. Take the submarine up, at 150. Sir, only one pressure unit is working. It will take us time to go up. We don't have a choice, Jadhav. Just do it. Yes, sir. Impact distance 550 meters. Sir, submarine is rising up. Up-up-up. Sir, they are heading upwards. But our first torpedo at 210 meters on target. 150 meters. Sir, the torpedoes missed. Yes. Sir both the torpedoes missed. What's the depth? 170 meters, sir, but they are still going up. It's the right direction... That's exactly where I want to send them. Okay. Pakistan. India. They are at 170. And if they keep going up at the same rate. then they will go maximum at 150. Torpedo one. And if they ascend at full speed then 100 meters. Torpedo two. And if they reverse their direction and dive instead. Then they cannot escape the speed of our third torpedo. We'll hit the Indian submarine at a depth of 200 meters. Game over. Launch torpedoes from tube 4, 5 and 6 Sir. Compartment seven! Compartment seven! Sir. They've launched three torpedoes. Depth 100, 150, 200, sir. Dammit. Dive to 125 and hold. It's very close anything can happen. Impact in 350 meters. Sir, depth 125 meters. Sir, they stopped at 125 meters depth. Impact in 250 meters. All compartments, hold for impact. 200 meters. Hold for support. Alright boys, hold. 100 meters. Sir, all three torpedoes missed. Sir, all three torpedoes missed. Up-down, -up-down. Is he a commander or a bloody liftman? Well done. Hold on, hold on, guys. This is not over, yet. All compartments, report for damage if any. Compartment 2, okay sir. Compartment 4 okay sir. Compartment 5, okay sir. Compartment 6, okay sir. Compartment 7, okay sir. Alright boys, listen up. This isn't over yet. We're still at war. We're diving to 350, sir. They cannot locate us at that depth. Arjun, 350 meters means the seabed. The battery unit can fail at any time. I hope you're aware of that. - Sir. Sir, Indian submarine diving. 250 meters. 260 meters. 280. 300, sir. They are still diving. Depth 350 meters, sir. Sir, all our aft torpedoes are exhausted. We must turn around at 180 to launch again. Engines off. We wait and watch. - Yes, sir. Engines off. Engines off. - Yes. Arjun, I think they know that we can't move back and forth. Only upwards and downwards. It will be difficult to get them in our firing line now. Enemy position. 150 meters depth, their engines are off. Sir, they've exhausted their front torpedoes. And in order to attack us with the rear torpedoes. They must make a 180 degree turn. In this line they will be in our firing range. We can take a clear shot. There's another possibility, Arjun. What if they take a 180 degree turn on starboard and come here? Then we'll have to fire from first compartment, which isn't possible. That compartment is filled with water. We... Sir, we're running out of power-supply and oxygen. Arjun, we've very little time left. We know that, but they don't. Any movement? - No, sir. Still engines are off. The British were right about them. These Indians! Long live. - Mother India! Long live! - Mother India! Long live! - Mother India! What is their depth? 350 meters, sir. Enough of this hide-n-seek. Program the forward torpedoes. Programming forward torpedoes, sir. Turn the boat 180 degrees starboard, now. - Aye, sir. Turning 180 degrees starboard. Before they can think of anything. we'll tilt the boat at 20 degrees and attack from front. - Sir. Head on. Sir, they are turning 180 starboard. Sir, you were right. 180 starboard. Surface the boat. - Surface the boat immediately. Program forward torpedoes. - Forward torpedoes? But how will we launch them? No, Arjun. - Yes, sir. Alright boys, hurry up. Program forward torpedoes. - Sir. Sir, Indian submarine rising very fast. Reprogram torpedo to our depth, quick! Reprogramming torpedo, sir. Move fast, take firing position quickly. On the double. Come on, fast. Taan Singh, hurry up. Torpedo, programmed sir. Depth 300 meters. Boys, quickly. Kamlakar. - Sir. Close the hatch immediately. But, sir. - Don't open it before we reach the surface. 250 meters. Sir, rising. In two minutes we'll be at the same depth as the enemy. Sir, if you stay inside...your life can be in danger. Without that, this submarine won't make it. Open the hatch. Come, quick-quick-quick. Ready to shoot, sir. - Shoot! Enemy has launched torpedo, sir. Sir, the enemy has launched torpedo. Yes. Yes, we did it. - Yes! Yes! Yeah! Take it to the surface. Fast, fast, fast. Can we open the hatch, sir? - Depth. 130 meters, sir. - No, not now. Wait. 110. 70. 90. Now, now boys, C'mon open it. Sir, sir, sir. We hit them. If our captain had still been alive. He would've been proud of this 'classroom-theory' officer. aLDEN @ Symbianize
