Steve, where are you? Steve? I want to go home. Shall we go? Steve? I don't want to come to this creepy house anymore. I'm not coming here again. I'm afraid. This was Freudstein's house. I want to go! Steve? Steven, where are you? Answer me. I'm scared! Bob, have you put everything in the box? Now you should help me pack the toys. Dad wants to leave as soon as... Honey? What's the matter? Did you fall asleep? Can you hear me? Mommy. Yes? What's wrong? Mommy, why does that girl tell me I shouldn't go? What are you talking about? What girl? Look! She's standing at the window in that house. Stop teasing me, please. Now she's gone. I don't think she was ever there in the first place. Yes, she was there. At that window. She was making gestures with her hand. And she spoke to you, I guess. Yes. She said that I shouldn't go over there. Why did she say that, Mommy? Well, maybe she's your friend. Maybe because she wants to spare you the trouble of packing your toys. Come on, get to work! Mae. Mae. Come home, Mae. No. Not now. I can't. I'm leaving tomorrow. Lucy still hasn't made up her mind. It was brave of you, taking over someone else's research at the most critical point. Especially because we're speaking of Eric Petersen. Boyle, you're the only one who can prevent his work from going to waste. You were Petersen's pupil, you worked together, you were friends. Now, even his death is involved in this project. Honestly, it's natural that you're the worthy heir of his legacy. You will do a great job. You would make him proud. Well, I hope so. Why do you think Eric would hang himself after he slaughtered the woman he loved? I don't know. The human mind... A research about suicide. And his death. It's horrible. Really weird. - Are you scared? - Yes. I mean, who wouldn't be? You know, I'm shocked because he was such a stable man. Full of joie de vivre. Keen to learn, to communicate, to love. You'll find out why he did it. I wish you good luck. Taxi! Well, Boyle, I'll visit you sometime at New Whitby. I love the countryside. I'll be looking forward to it, sir. Goodbye. Norman! Hurry! I'm coming. Oh, for God's sake, flowers, too. - I don't want them to die. - Give me that. So, are you sure? It's too late now. We've already packed everything. By the way, have you been to see Mrs. Petersen? No, why? All I need is in the New Whitby library. You knew her. You should offer her your condolences. They had been divorced for over 20 years. He lived with that young woman, his assistant, didn't he? Yes. Sheila. Poor woman. They loved each other so much. It seems he slaughtered her before he hung himself. Then after Mommy changed her mind for the sixth time... - Me, huh? -...the place was already rented. So where are we going to live? In an even nicer place, or so I hope. Thanks to Professor Muller. Otherwise, you'd be sleeping in a tent. New Whitby. Four hundred miles from New York. - Are you tired? - A bit nervous. You're going to be fine here. Breathe in the country air. Here's the agency. Stay right here, Bob. We'll be back in a minute, okay? Okay. Oh, I'm so late. I'm sorry. Mr. and Mrs. Boyle? - I'm Laura Gittleson. Nice to meet you. - How do you do? You should sign where I've marked. Sit down, please. So, you came along. Good choice. A change for the better. Cleaning wasn't necessary. Professor Petersen left it in excellent condition. They did tell you it was the same house, didn't they? Of course you've been there before, haven't you, Dr. Boyle? No. Get the keys, Harold, please? What keys? Ah. The Freudstein's keys. Oak Mansion, Harold. Yeah, sure. Oak Mansion. Yeah. Well, how do you find our little village? It's not exactly New York, but I'm sure you'll grow to like it. Let's hope. Bob? Bob? I'm here. Behind you. On the other side of the street. - Hi. - Hi. My name is Mae. I've been waiting for you. I'm Bob. My dad is a researcher. His name is Norman Boyle. I know. I told you not to come, though. Mommy didn't want to. Dad said he has to do an important study for a New York museum. You shouldn't have come, Bob. I'll go first. Follow me. - That's my car. - Okay. - Bob! - Mommy! I saw the girl from before. - Why did you get out of the car? - She gave me this doll. She called me and gave me this doll. - Did you remember her? - You're very unruly. She was waiting for me. She lives here, too. They'll connect the phone line by next week. - Thank you. - You're welcome. It's my job. I'll find you a babysitter soon. Oh, thank you. See you, then, madam. Good luck, professor. You know where to find me if you need anything else. Damn graves. So, be honest, are you happy? I am. - Norman! - Yes? This house seems like the one in that photo we have in New York. In the living room. You're right. It's a typical example of local architecture. They copied the old English houses, so they look exactly the same. Hey. Come on, we have many things to unload. And they're on the starting line! They're revving up! There we are. And here's the checkered flag. And they're off! Now it works perfectly. ...with a fast sprint... He passes the opponent... Maybe Bob and I should have stayed in New York. Please, Lucy. Not again. Stop it, please. Who knows? Maybe I'll be sad to leave in six months. Six months won't be long enough. I want to figure out why Petersen hung himself. We don't need another problem. I understand. The story shocked me, as well. It's scaring and fascinating at the same time. But I have to do this. I can't give up. Bob always collects trash. This doll is creepy! You're tired. You should take one of those pills Nick prescribed you. I read it can provoke hallucinations. It's this house! It creeps me out. It's a house like any another. It smells like death. What if that girl was killed here? Why is this door shut? We'll open it. No... I'll open it now. I know I'm a burden. Sorry. - It'll be a minute. - No. Let's fix up the rooms first. I'd like to sleep in a real bed tonight. What do you think? And again, he's passed everyone! Okay. Bravo! He's a great champion! World champion! Bob! Honey, it's time to sleep. No, Mommy. - Hello. - Hello. Are you Mrs. Boyle? Yes. I'm Ann. Mrs. Gittleson sent me over. I'm the babysitter. Ann? No. You can take the car. But you'll need it to get home. I can take a bus. But it only leaves once every hour. I want to walk and go by the grocery store. Who was it? Mrs. Gittleson. She didn't see me. Or she turned the other way on purpose. - Maybe you're wrong. - Maybe. - Are you more relaxed now? - I'm better. And I'm happy that we have Ann now, taking care of the kid. - See you later. - Okay. In the last semester, he acted differently. He wasn't the same person. He hardly ever passed by. I had the impression he was jealous of his assistant. Professor Boyle, may I ask you something? Sure. What did he tell you that night? Which night? I was there. You visited him with your daughter. Last October, if I'm not wrong. I never paid a visit to him. In fact, this is the first time I've been here. Are you sure? Of course I am. Anyway, I don't have a daughter. I have a son. Strange. I could have sworn it. Dr. Wheatley, you called me? Ah! Our precious boy! If you can't find a book, document, or material of any kind, ask him. That's why he's so precious. Everything is exactly how the Professor left it. Those are his notes. I didn't dare touch anything. Are you going to carry on Professor Petersen's research? - It looks like it. - Well... Over here, you'll find all the medical reports, death certificates, and lists of missing people. Why did he need this stuff? His study was... ...different. I don't know. When he asked me to get these, I told him that it wasn't relevant for his work. - And? - And... He said that he needed it for personal research. Did you know about it? No. But it will be interesting, I suppose. Good. If you need me, just ring the bell. He hung himself from that railing. Over there. Do you know who that lady is? She was Dr. Freudstein's wife. Who's Dr. Freudstein? - I can't tell you. - Why, Mae? She's not buried here. I know. She's not buried here. "September 24, 1873. Dr. Jacob Freudstein suspended from the Medical Association..." "Freudstein." Bob? Bob! Ann? Bob... Ann. Lucy? Lucy! Lucy. Lucy. Hey. How do you feel? Better. - Have Bob and Ann come back? - Not yet. Norman, we should go to the estate agency. And ask them to find us another house. I mean, do you think it's normal living in a house with a grave in the floor? Not normal, but not unheard of. - It's the 21st century. - I know. Most of the old houses in this area have graves. In the winter, it's difficult to dig outside. - Is that so? - Because it's too cold. Come on, Lucy. We can't believe in witches, ghosts, and rubbish like that. And now we're trying to solve the cellar door mystery. No. We're home, Mrs. Boyle. Daddy! I saw my new friend Mae, and she said to tell you “hi, ” and also to Mommy. What are you doing? I'm trying to open this door, to show Mom the cellar. Help me. Try this. Did you see that girl, too? No. But you weren't with him? Yes. All the time. Bob found it. Thanks! It's all rusty. Must be years since the last time it was opened. - What is it over there? - Just old things, I guess. - Let's go and see. - No, stay here. I'll go. Norman! Ann! - Why did you shout like that? - It was just... I don't know, something... Help me! Help! Dad! I see. I'll tell Mrs. Gittleson. And please tell her we want to move no later than tomorrow. Yes, very well. Will it be difficult to find another house? I can't really say, but I don't think so. Then tell her by tomorrow. - Okay? - Yes, very well. I'll call her and try to solve your problem. I'm calling her. Freudstein. That damn Freudstein house. No. - It was inevitable. - What? That they'd want to leave the Freudstein's property. Oak Mansion, Harold. Remember it. If we want to rent it, we have to call it Oak Mansion. Yes, whatever. Oak Mansion. Call it what you like, but it's always Freudstein's house to me. Mae. Mae? We have to. I suppose so. What were you doing? Looking at that house. You can't see it from here. It's time to go to bed. Don't go inside. Whoever you are, don't go inside. Hello? Mrs. Boyle? Ann? Mrs. Boyle? Ann? Mrs. Boyle? No! No! Good morning, Ann. Good morning. What are you doing? I made coffee. What a shame you didn't come with us to the restaurant last night. But your parents must have been glad to see you again, huh? Do you live far from here? - Norman? - Yes? That girl, Ann... - What if she's dangerous for Bob? - No, come on. She's weird. - Is it interesting? - What? I mean, did you find anything interesting? I don't know. Petersen was writing about a surgeon. A 19th century doctor. He did bizarre experiments on humans. And what did that have to do with his research? Nothing at all. Maybe he was going nuts. - Honey. - What? I have to go to New York, to see Muller. - When? - Today. I should tell you the truth, Lucy. In my opinion, Petersen's suicide was somehow connected with his research on that criminal doctor. Oh, it's you. Surprised? Well, it's Sunday, so... And why are you here? Nothing. Just a check. My duty is to check all the wings of the library. I won't waste your time. Excuse me. - Got you! - Just because I fell. Otherwise, you'd never catch me. Where are you going? I have to go home, or Ann will be mad at me. Mom's gone out, and she thinks I'm still in my room. No, she won't get mad. I tell you, she will, because Mommy told her not to let me out. Don't go to that house, Bob. I just pretend, then I'll sneak out again. - Bye. - Bye! Wait for me! No, Bob, don't go inside. Days and nights since I've been working on this. I can't eat or sleep. But I can't stop now. I have to... I've lost my critical thinking. The signs. The warnings of this house. Freudstein. That tormented crying. And Sheila smiles. What can I do to make her believe me? Maybe I'm mad. Yes. This is unreal. Freudstein's house attracts me and frightens me. How many fell in this spider's web? And how many will in the future? The smell of the rooms terrifies me and attracts me. The smell of blood. How many more are going to fall into it? Keeping on... I want to go on looking into this mystery. I want to discover the worst part of it. Go on, know... Find out... Freudstein. His voice. It's not his voice. Blood! Blood! Not only blood. His voice. I can hear it now. I hear it! I hear it everywhere! Sheila! Do you believe me now? Do you believe me? No! No! Sheila! No! No! Not the children! Get ready, Johnny. We're doing a great race! Ready? Go! Johnny just before the big turn passes Norman Smith. The race is becoming interesting! Tiger went off the road. But he gets back on the track. And he has to reach his opponents. Norman. What the... Bob! Where are you? Answer me! Bob! Are you down there? Answer me. Are you all right? Wait. I'm coming down to get you. Bob? Bob? Bob! Please, answer me. Help me! Bob! Open the door! Madam! Help me! Open the door! Open the door! Help! Yogi, we must take action! Open the door! Ann? Ann! Ann! Bob? Ann? Can you help me? Bob? Ann? Bob? Bob? Mommy! What's wrong? - Mommy! - What happened? I'm really scared. Where's Ann? Why are you scared? She's... Mommy. Were you playing? Is she hiding? I was upstairs, and I heard her screaming. And I went down to the cellar. And then... What? - And they cut off Ann's head. - What? Yes, Mommy. Believe me. - Her head is in the cellar. - Bob! - Calm down. - It's true. - Calm down. - I saw it. I promise, Mommy. It was on those steps. Bob, you scared me a lot. Hey. What are you doing? Why did you enter here? - I didn't know it was forbidden. - It's closed now. - What do you want, anyway? - I'm looking for a grave. - Which grave? - Dr. Freudstein's. Oh, you, too? - What do you mean? - Well, you're not the first. Look, I came over 150 miles to see this grave, - and I don't want to... - You're wasting your time. There's no Dr. Freudstein here. But... According to these records, he's buried here. Records are worth nothing. It's just a rumor that he's buried here. Just a rumor. And now if you don't mind... Please. Please, get out. Thanks, Mommy. Ann will come back tomorrow. You'll see. She's probably gone to visit her parents. Go to sleep now. It's late. Good night. Sleep well. Ann? Mommy says you're not dead. Is it true? Ann? Are you here? Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Let me out of here! Bob? - Bob? - I'm in the cellar! Help me! Mommy! I'm scared! Let me out, please! - Stay calm. - Mommy! Mommy! Let me out! Stay calm. I'll get you out. Mommy! I'm scared! Use the key like Daddy did! I don't want to stay in here! - Hurry, Mommy! - Stay calm. Mommy! Just a minute! What are you doing? I'm trying! Mommy! Mommy! Please, help me! Mommy! Hurry! Let me out! Let me out! Please! Why can't you open it? What happened? Answer me! Oh, no! There's got to be a way to open this door! Damn it! Mommy! Don't leave me here! There's somebody here, Mommy! I'm scared! There's someone here! He's coming for me! No! Mommy! Lucy! What's wrong, Lucy? Mommy! Bob is in there? We have to hurry! We have to break down the door. There was an ax here. Bob! Keep away from the door! Yes, Daddy! Don't cry, Bob! I'll get you out! - There's someone behind that door! - Dr. Freudstein! Petersen found out everything. That's why he killed Sheila. Mommy! Bob! And Petersen hung himself. No! My God! Bob! That monster needs even younger victims, - to renew himself. - Bob! Bob! Bob! Norman! Oh, Norman! Norman! Bob! Bob! Hurry! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! - Mae! - Bob! Mae. Mae. Time to go home, Mae Freudstein. Bob is with us now. And someone else will come along soon.
