Baby, I will pay you back. I swear it. Thank you. He didn't pay you. No, did he pay you? They deduct from my allowance. That's why he didn't have enough money. Good for you. it's good for you.

Is your daughter home? If I agreed, she's to be left alone. Mommy. I'm working double shifts today. I'll be back... Okay, okay, you can go to work, eh? Go to work. It's fine. Everything is fine What's going on? Who are you? Your father is dead. Yeah, he died years ago. No, he died three weeks ago. We buried him today. Toun. Tell me. He asked that he tell you himself. I could have known you better. I'm sorry you thought I was hitting on you. I wanted to talk to you just once before I died. I made a mess of that, just like I've made a mess of everything where it concerns you. From what I see, you have turned out to be a fine young woman. I don't have the right to ask this of you, but I would like you to carry on my legacy. What did he do? He left her a controlling interest in the Audere Group. No, we had a deal. What does this mean? Vilonia. That's what she said, and that he left me something called Audere Group. Toun, why did you mother see a rich man like this? I don't know. I didn't ask. I just left. Toun. Don't Toun me. Binta, she lied to me about my father for my entire life. Uh uh. Did you say Audere Group? Come let me show you something. Come. See now, wait, Audere Group, see? How did you know? I said I served in the same factory in , but they didn't retain me. I thought you worked for Happy Foods. Happy Food is on the Audere Group now. They own a lot of companies. See, Happy Food, Audere. Hey, so this is your new duty. If you continue at this rate, you will soon both be out of work. Hey, one madam is looking for you outside. Get away from here. Yes, well done, because this is the new job you have. Binta, what is your problem? My dear, you ran off. We have so much to discuss. I'm sorry, ma'am, but can I please have some time? Of course. How about I send a car over for you this evening? Is that okay? Thank you, and I'm sorry for your loss. Thank you. See you later. Bye. I'm supposed to take only Ms. Toun. I need her please. As you wish. Oh boy, just look at somebody's house. Toun? Thank you. Thank you so much for coming. The service entrance is at the back. It's okay,. They're my guests. Sorry to have kept you all waiting. Toun. She's the owner of Audere holdings? Can we challenge the will? Patrick. Look, he killed himself, dad, which kind of argues that he was not in his right mind. He killed himself? He had a terrible disease called multiple sclerosis. It weakens the nerves, and his could have led to dementia, so he decided to take his own life. So he killed himself because he was going crazy? Your father was in possession of his faculties, even though tests revealed he was degenerating... Of course you were gonna say that. You're his little loyal boy. Look, dad we... Mr. Ifeanyi was examined by a barrage of psychiatrists, Mr. Patrick, who certified his mental state at the time the will was drafted. Thank you, Joseph. It doesn't matter. We will not be challenging the will. You should have told me. He made me promise not to. 'Til the end, he still didn't trust me. Welcome to the family. See you tomorrow. What did he mean by see you tomorrow? Why am I the CEO of Audere? Audere holdings owns majority of the shares of the Audere Group, and so they have the rights to appoint the next CEO Until then, the owner serves as the acting CEO. This is insane. I can't run a company. I'm a shop girl. Why would he do this? He believed you could run it. What if I don't want it? Can't you appoint somebody else? The next Board meeting is in 60 days. You can nominate someone else then. It can be quicker. Please, just wait the 60 days. Let's see how it all plays out. Take me home, please. Ifeanyi and I got married while he was building Audere. His family was rich. They opposed the marriage, the usual drama. The scandal was affecting him in business. Everyone was a friend of the family. I went to his mother to reconcile She told me to leave him, that she could have the marriage annulled. And you agreed? I did. I did what was best for him because I loved him. And me? What was best for me? I didn't know I was pregnant then. I went to tell him, but he was already dating his current wife,. How did he find out about me? The JSS prize you won when you were 12, it made the papers. Why did he care? He was married. His wife couldn't have children. He wanted... Me, and you said no. I allowed him to fund your education. The scholarship, that was him. Why? Why not just tell me? I could have had 11 years with him, not one day. You took that from me. I thought you would choose him. You should have trusted me. Think you would have chosen to live here instead of? I guess we'll never know now, will we? Ha. Your driver is waiting outside. Toun, talk to me, please, I love you, Mommy, but I need some space right now. Toun. Quam. Toun, I don't like this now. I placed a call to you yesterday. You didn't pick. I was busy. You are busy for me, Toun? For me. It's okay. Anyway, see called me. He said that there is a serious buyer for the sewing machine. Yes, but the person want to pay 15,000. He said if I'm able to match it, he can give me this machine, so sweetheart, I don't know. you can help me too. I don't know. Maybe you can help me to talk to your mother. My mother? Quam. Toun, Toun, who have this car? It's mine. Look, I'll explain everything later. Let's meet at our place at 3:00. It's your own? 50,000. Check this thing, man. Uncle Johnny. Good morning. How are you? I'm fine, good morning. Welcome, eh? Yes, sir. Welcome. Quam said it's 15K to , so I've come to. 25,000 naira now. Why is it 25,000 naira now? Just this morning, Quam told me it's 15,000, Uncle Johnny. You have a machine. Yes, yes, I do. The company wide email went out this morning. Welcome. Please. Where are you going? This is an executive committee meeting. He's not a member. Don't worry. You'll be fine. We don't bite. Speak for yourself. Right, this is Ganiyu Osamede. We're still training him. Now let me introduce you to, you don't have to hold up your hand. Why are all of you okay with me as CEO? That's a good question. We are not like most companies. All the people you see here are CEOs in their own right, running their own subsidiaries, well, apart from Patrick and Angela. He runs strategy, and she runs communications, and as for me, I am head of operations. AKA adult supervision. Okay, so if all of you are CEOs, what will I be doing? You review the performance of their businesses. You decide if you want to buy more businesses. Is it that simple? Simple is relative. So it doesn't really matter if I'm bad at it? Oh, it matters a great deal. Your job is to think of the future whilst we focus on the present. Don't worry. It will make sense as we go along. Let's get into it. Ganiyu. Yeah. You start. Okay. You are crazy. All of you are crazy. This is insane. I can't run a company. She can't run Audere. You saw her. She did okay and wasn't afraid to ask questions. You should be the one running Audere. That's enough, Patrick. That's enough. Me, I can't last 60 days though. I have set up a meeting... I don't think we're there yet. You're pretty. That works. Can you read? Yes, I can read. Here are your business cards. How did you get my phone number? Would you like to change anything about the office? No. Okay, here is your company laptop and your company phone. Your new number will start working in 20 minutes. You need clothes. I will send my stylist to meet you within the hour. We have an appointment at the bank. Fine, bring her when you're done. I will send an address. I'm having lunch my boyfriend. Fine, you send an address, and I will meet you there and take you to the stylist. So you're now a billionaire? Yes, yes, she is. Great, now that that's out of the way, this is your brief for tonight. This is a lie. Everything in here is a lie. I wasn't trained by my father. You're the acting CEO of a billion dollar company with three listed subsidiaries. You need to present an image that instills confidence. I was a salesgirl in his super markets. Ifeanyi was a driver before he became CEO. It's part of his mystique. This is insane. This is business Sorry, CEO. Toun, are calling CEO. Yes, my father made me CEO. Well, technically your shares made you CEO. Anyone can be appointed CEO. So that's why you're being nice to me. You are hoping that maybe I'll make you the CEO. I am being nice to you because I'm the head of corporate communications in one of the biggest companies in Nigeria. I am being nice to you because we employ thousands of people and serve millions of consumers, and we need them to believe that everything will be okay. I am being nice to you because you are my CEO, and I am very good at my job. What do you need me to do? We're going to eat our mala, and then we're going to get to work. Welcome to Moments Nigeria. Today, our guest is Toun Odumosu. She is the new CEO of the Audere Group, and interesting fact, she is the youngest CEO in the company's history. and so nice to have you on Moments. It's nice to be here. You look absolutely gorgeous, by the way. Thank you. Thank you. Fantastic, so your father Ifeanyi was really a visionary. Do you feel you'll be able to live up to his legacy? The truth is nothing prepares you to be CEO except being CEO. She's killing it. Although working at the supermarket did give me a feel of... Who are you? Her best friend. At the ground level, but thankfully I have... Say that when she'll need you. So tell me more about your team and how you've all have been working together. Okay, so at Audere Group we have a. That's not your bed. Get up. Go on, go to your house. Which house? It's amazing. What? See you tomorrow. You did well yesterday. Thank you, uncle. We're here to approve an additional $10 million investment into women's fashion. What is it for? We're automating and standardizing designs for our women's lines. Why? Nigerian women hate standardized fashion. That's what I said. We've had a little success with automation in the past. And in women's fashion? So you don't support the investment? It's your call. We can't do this without your say so. I don't think we should do it. Dad. Tell to come up with a new plan for women's fashion. As you wish. Wow, you mean your father sent you to work here just to understand FMCG. That's what they are saying. Please, please, please customers are trying to eat here. Am I not a customer too? You're going to make. She will make me pay for that. Only because you're letting her. Toun, I don't work for you. But you applied for the food science job yourself. And I didn't get it 'till you became CEO. Why do you think it has anything to do with me? I'm not stupid, no. Your is here. I think we might have a problem. It is a press release announcing you winner of Fashion Week's Next Rated. I don't see what the big deal is. You don't see what the big deal is? Please explain to your client what the big deal is. Our narrative is that your father prepared you for the role of CEO. A fashion show undercuts that. It means you have other interests. But I worked for this for years. You want me to turn it down? If you want to be CEO, yes. But I'm already CEO. Acting CEO. The Board of Directors still need to approve for your position to be permanent, and they won't if they see you prancing around on a runway. This is not fair. You're pulling out. How can you be pulling out? It doesn't fit with our priorities. I was not talking to you. Toun, please talk to me. It doesn't fit with my priorities. How can you do this to her? We need to have a press conference. Auntie Fatima, is anything wrong? I did. Angie? Did we have anything planned? Well, now we do. I don't feel like. and that's all that matters. Go on, dress up. Let's go to the bank. I have been invited your boyfriend, Quam, and I got us VIP tickets. Go on, dress up now. Let's go. See that's your tights dress. Remember that's one that shows your shit very. Yeah, that's why you don't need those. Private party. Uh uh, now. Private party. Look at his face now. Binta. Let's go. Let's go. Let's not. Hi, I will pay for all your drinks tonight if you let us have your table. Sure? Yes. Wait, what are you doing? I'm having fun. Hey, hey, hey. Madam, the bottles are here. Please. I can see that. Bring these bottles. Put them on top of. Bring it. I'm sorry, sir, but we have ran out of this. What's that? We have completely sold out. What are you talking about? There are no drinks. Go and find out who's making noise. Sit down. Sit down. Let me. I want to see. My brother, my brother and his girlfriend. They bought out the bar. Huh? My brother and his girlfriend bought out the bar. Your brother? Your brother buy out my. Enjoy yourself. This is my. pleasure to meet you. Okay, is that why you were able to buy all these? Toun, wait now, wait. Wait for me now, Toun. Wait. Toun, wait now. What? Wait now. You invited her, Binta. This is your mother, for crying out loud. She's worried about you. That woman is not your business. You help. It's not your business. Why have you been avoiding her? And it's not me you just spoke to like that. Okay, yes, oh, but Binta, you shouldn't have done it behind my back now. You pity the woman now. Just talk to her. Wait, where are you going? I'm going home. Who is supposed to pay for those drinks? Take. The pin is three, three, one, eight. Knock yourself out. I don't know what I'm supposed to do with this. How does she just get here and then? I don't know. How hard does one feel like this? I don't know. You spent four million last night. What are you talking about? It's all over social media, drinking, dancing on tables and chairs, being rowdy, and the coup de grace. Things got a little out of hand. Little? You call this a little? Are you crazy? Patrick. What? She's disgraced this entire company. Angela, can we fix this? I can try. Try not to do any more crazy shit. How much longer must this continue? She's Ifeanyi's choice. Uncle Ifeanyi was crazy. Yes, he was your brother, but he was. You built this company with him for 20 years. Are you really gonna leave it in her hands, let her destroy your legacy? I can't be seen to. She has to choose to step down. Four million naira. Why are you shouting? Were you not the one that said I should buy the whole bar? Your boyfriend Quam was just ordering things in here. Champagne alone was one million naira. You should be thanking me, silly. If not for me, you would have spent six million naira. Thank you. 1,000. I'll see you later. I have school. Goodbye. Thank you for coming. You see over there? She's the new rising star, but she's not you. Why are you showing me this? You spent four million naira last night. I was celebrating. Celebrating what? Giving up on your dreams? I have decided to leave a slot open in the show for you. Thank you, but I'm going to have to decline. I will leave the slot open anyway. Look, I've had this lecture. I don't need another one. Your father was right about you. 10 years ago, I was your father's driver for a day in PH. I drove him from the airport into town. There was traffic, so we had a three hour conversation. At the end, he knew I was a law graduate from uni, couldn't afford law school. He paid for my law school, sent me to Harvard for a Master's in law and hired me immediately. How nice of him. My point is Ifyeani was gifted, so if he thinks you can be CEO, he's right. I just got offered a spot at Fashion Week if I want it. Then take it. I'm sure your Uncle Chuka will be fine as CEO. Why does he get to choose my life? Why? That someone chooses for you doesn't make it the wrong choice. Why can't I just have both? Sometimes we don't get to choose. Thank you. Angela, can we talk? What can I help you with, Ms. Odumosu? I just want to say that I'm sorry You've been nothing but great to me, and all I've done is waste all your effort. Not all, just most. Can we fix it? You want me to do a reality show touring the company's facilities? That's brilliant. By highlighting you as CEO doing CEO things, it will make it difficult for them not to approve you. Thank you. We're going to have to do more with your look. I'll do anything you want me to do. By the time we're done with you, not only are you going to look like a genius CEO, but everyone is going to agree that you are one. Yeah, so do you feel like a CEO yet? Do you ever feel like CEO? I'm sorry. You used those exact same words for all your interviews. You haven't seen all my interviews. Of course I have. Why? Well, 'cause you're my CEO. I wanted to get to know you. And what have you found out? That Angela is a damn good writer. I'm going to report you. To who? I'm CEO. Yeah. Oh, so sorry. Hello. I'm coming. I'm coming I'm so sorry. I have to leave. That's fine. We can continue later tonight at dinner. You can't say no. Fine, where do I meet you? I'll call Joseph, okay? Alright. What's going on here? You look like our sister. Sure you understand, so that's why we just want you to join us. Join you? Yeah. Join you how? As the investment now. You know, investment, you invest, you know? Investment, you think I want to marry you? I mean, Quam,. Toun. Toun, wait. Toun. How could you do that to me? This is great opportunity. So great you had to ambush me. Toun, that was just the light presentation. What is the problem? What's the problem? Quam, you are my boyfriend, and you're plotting against me. These not plotting, Toun. This is sport betting. Do know that with 200 million there is high probability that you can make two billion naira? How much is your cut? 10% of the amount. Toun, I'm not going to take catch. I just want to secure my investment so I can help to build my future. You know what I've always wanted. What about the exam? You pass it now, and you become an accountant. I can't. That was our plan. But then you became a billionaire. Will you date me if I'm collecting 40,000 naira? That is my choice, Quam. It is my choice. I need this, Toun. Why is it always about what you need, what you want? I'm such a fool. You know, I thought I was more to you, but I was wrong. 20 million naira is nothing to you. I know that if I can able to secure this deal, this might change my life forever. How can you say no to that? Four years with you, and this is what it comes to. Toun, I beg you, please, please. This is not the kind of man that I can disappoint. You told him I'll do it. Quam, if I do this, me and you, we are through. I will send you my account details. Are you okay? Can I invest 200 million naira in that company? You want to do the deal... Just answer the question. As CEO of Audere, your personal investment threshold is 50 million. You have to do this through Audere. Make the arrangements. Toun, I don't think this... I didn't ask you what you thought, Joseph. Just do it. As you wish, Ms. Odumosu. Yes, Mr. Osamede, I got the address. Are you still having dinner with Osamede tonight? Yes, I am. How are you? Good. You look beautiful. Thank you. You can go. I'll take her home. It's okay, Joseph. I'll be fine. Enjoy your drink, ma'am. Thank you. So what do you mean by got off easy? Well, for one, you signed a good deal today, and for 200 million you found out your boyfriend is an asshole. That's easy. So you think it's a good deal? You do. If not, you wouldn't have signed the deal, boyfriend or no boyfriend. I just wish he'd have told me, like why did he have to go behind my back? He wanted a cut. He comes to you, he doesn't get one. So are you saying what he did was right? Of course not. He's an asshole. That's why you should hang around rich people like me who want you and not you money. Thank you. So what movie are we watching? I'm sorry? I have this really sweet home system and connects in Hollywood, so we can watch whatever movie we want. How about we go to the cinema instead? Right, what film? Wedding Party Two. Never heard of it. Hold on. What? It's a Nollywood film? Great, there's a viewing at 11:00 P.M. Shall we? Okay, after you. So what do you mean you only do what matters to you? Again, it's like at work. You do what everyone else wants you to do, right? Everyone is depending on you, looking up to you. Tell me about it. Exactly, but in your private life, you want to do what you want to do, you know, create some sort of balance. But I have friends, family. I can't just ignore, shit. What? It's my friend's birthday today, and I told her I'll meet her at the beach. Oh, I'll take you there. Okay. Oh, she's going to kill me. Oh my God. Oh, don't cut me off. Man, I saw you dancing like this. I'm like, wow. Hi, everybody. Hi. Hi. Binta. Binta, I'm sorry I missed it. I understand, man. I know you're a very busy person, man. Don't be like that. Don't be like what, man? Tell me how you want me to be like, so that I'll adjust, man. But I said I'm sorry. Your mother said she was sorry too. When was the last time you spoke to her? Binta, don't go there. Or what? You'll stop being my friend? See, you stopped being my friend the second you became a billionaire. It just took me this long to realize it. Toun, you missed my birthday. Here, keys to my apartment and a brand new car for you so you don't have any issues getting to your new job. Here. A letter of employment from County Food's food science department. Don't worry. It's not one of my companies, and yes, I stopped being your friend. Happy birthday. I'm sorry. That's the thing about these people. You can't just... Not right now, please. Do you want anything? Hello. Hello. Hey, you better not have finished that ice cream. Okay, I'll let you two talk. Binta. I'm sorry I missed it. Yesterday you gave me keys to your flat, a car, and my dream job. Yes, you're my best friend. It's... And you can take all of that away. Binta, I would never do that to you. Toun, you are changing. if I had told you a few weeks ago that you stopped talking to your mom, would you have believed me? Okay, so what does that mean? We're no longer friends. See, if you need me to be your friend, you can't give me keys to your flat, a car, and a job. I was... I need to be me, and this isn't me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. Wait, I haven't forgotten about my present. I haven't finished talking. Oh yeah, finish it. Come now. Have you seen this? What is it? It's the due diligence reports on the betting company Toun bought. How bad is it? I mean, it's owned by a local gang. Look, the CEO is even on trial for murder. Have you told Toun? Why not? She didn't ask for due diligence. The legal guys just did their job, and the investment, well, that's already gone through. Dammit. Actually, this, this is good for us. Yes, Joseph, I know I'm running late. Mrs. would like to see you before you go into the office. What? Why? She didn't say. I would advise that you honor the invitation. Okay, whatever. I'll be there. I don't understand. You did approve this deal, yes? Did you wait for a full due diligence report to be done? What is a due diligence report? What on earth are you teaching her? Please answer my question or make your point. A due diligence report is a thorough review. The due diligence of this company shows that it's been run by criminals. If that's what they wanted to know, all they had to do was ask me. So you knew they were criminals? You can't invest in a company that's run by criminals. Why not? Because their money is not clean. But we bought Shaiyu, and the CEO of Shaiyu's father was a governor. Is her money clean? It's not the same thing. Well, maybe it is, but it's not seen as the same. Okay, I'll explain it to them. I'm afraid it's too late for that. Chuka has already called an emergency Board meeting. No problem. I'll explain it there. I expect that he will pressure you to resign and hire someone else. Oh. He's trying to get rid of me? Yes, and the Board is firmly behind him. Including you? No, he doesn't have me. Thank you for telling me. I said you can't go in. He's in a meeting. It's alright, Nikki. It's fine. So what was all that bullshit, that bullshit about supporting me and helping me succeed? What are you talking about? What are you doing? Working out an angle for my resignation,? Resignation, what resignation? Your father here called an emergency Board meeting to get me to resign. Dad, is this true? She did it to herself. Her continued recklessness, I mean, she backed criminals. Even if I made a mistake, this one is easily fixable. In your opinion. I can fight. I can refuse to appoint a CEO. Thus destroying your father's legacy just after his death. No, seriously, good job. Look, it doesn't have to be like this, okay? There doesn't have to be conflict. All you have to do is just craft a new statement that you don't want to be CEO. You want me to take over. You want to chase your own path in fashion design. You're debuting at the Lagos Fashion Week. What do you mean Lagos Fashion Week? I heard they kept a spot for you. And who told you that? Look, Toun, it doesn't matter who told me. In fact, Toun? Toun? How long have you been working for them? What are you talking about? Uncle Chuka mentioned Lagos Fashion Week. Who else could have told him? What are you accusing me of? You have been working with them behind my back to take this company from me. You have been content to play CEO on TV and have refused to put in the work to move this company forward. I warned you about the purchase, but you shut me out. Nobody had to conspire against you, Toun. You did this to yourself. Are they going to bounce you? Looks like it. Will they take your money? No, that one is mine to keep. Everything is sorted,. Oh, you want to become CEO. Yes. Until they tried to take it from me, I didn't realize how much I actually want to be CEO. Binta, I can do this. Hey, what about fashion? Anyway, how are you going to remain CEO? I don't know. You are right. Thank you. Buy something. She's looking. We are here, ma'am. They are trying to get me to resign. Is that what you want to talk about? We haven't spoken in over a month, and this is what you say to me? Fine, I'll start. I was selfish. I gave up everything for him. I didn't see why I had to give you up too. I am sorry. You were right. Mommy, I've been a billionaire for what? Six weeks, and my life is completely crazy. I can barely handle it at 23. At 12? Only God knows what would have happened. I'm sorry. Thank you for being my everything. Oh, but Mommy, this could be anybody in this picture. Okay, fine, it's me, but why are you following him on Instagram? When did you even get on Instagram? When you stopped talking to me. I have to get information about you somehow. That is why I'm not shouting on you for having a man in your house, so you guys had to get. I don't know. Maybe. Oh my God. Whoa, that is the most hideous thing I have ever seen. Be nice. I saved for months to buy it. Well, that doesn't speak to your judgment. Should I be worried, Ms. CEO? Shut up. Do you know I sewed my way into Fashion Week on that machine? I even got in, like there's a spot waiting for me right now if I want it. You used to be a designer before all of this? Well, I was working on it. Want to work on something else? Are you okay? Yes, yes, Mommy, but I have to go. Oh, oh, oh, okay. I have to go. Okay. Sorry. Okay, user interface, the colors, what don't you like about the colors? Can we talk in private? Sure, can you give me 10 minutes? I need to run feedback with the guys. Sorry to keep you waiting. You asshole, you plotted against me. Plot is strong word. I was trying to help you. Trying to help me by helping them take my job. I thought you didn't want the job. Maybe you should have spoken to me before you stabbed me in the back. Toun, I'm sorry. Thank you for coming, Joseph. How may I help you, ma'am? However, I'm not the one who needs your help. Sorry for the deception, but she really needs to speak with you. You weren't taking my calls. I've decided now that I want to stay as CEO, and I'll be needing your help. Why should I help you? Anyone else would be a better CEO than you. Maybe, but you helped me because my father asked you to. Joseph, now I'm asking you for me. You owed my father, yet you don't owe me, but I'm just... I'm sorry. I can't. Why? I'm sorry. I just can't. Why can't you help me? I need you to tell me why you can't help me. Why? You mean he kissed you, and you didn't kiss him back? Are you crazy? Why would I kiss him back? Toun, anyway, I don't blame you. It's because you are used to dating nonsense boys. That's why you can't recognize a good one. If it's Quam, now you'll be opening your tits. Thanks for coming. I brought food. Thank you. What are you doing here? I asked her to come. You'd be against your father. You are my CEO, and you're in a crisis. Uncle Chuka just sent me an email. Toun, the chairman has consented to an emergency Board meeting. I will be requesting that you step down and appoint me CEO for a five year term. We will ensure that my successor is able to carry on the rings. He's speaking about Patrick, by the way, and if you step down you're never going to be in a position to come back again. I suggest we come together for the best interest of the company. It looks like he copied the Board. Excuse me. Binta, you don't have to raise your hand. Sorry, you. You know I'm new to this corporate , but why are you sure he's not the right CEO? Because my father didn't pick him. Ifeanyi was a genius, right? Yes. Well, he chose me in office over Uncle Chuka. Okay, yeah, I may not be the best person to run Audere, but neither is he. But the Board thinks he's the best candidate. Then we need to convince them... How? We convince them that investing in Ultimate Bet was a genius move. That seems bold. That's what we want. You want me, , to sell my company? Yes, yes, I do. Quam, this your girl is crazy, no? I like that. The offer is three billion naira. I believe that's 10 times what you paid three years ago. This girl is crazy. Do we have a deal? Toun. Congrats. You just made 300 million. What do you mean? I'm keeping the terms of your agent deal, 10%. Toun, so after all this, you still do this for me. Why? Because, Quam, I truly believe that you're the man I think you are. Hopefully this will give you a chance to show it. Toun, I don't know how to thank you. I so much appreciate this. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Joseph, all signed? What happen? I want me to change. Can we talk? Joseph. I see he has transferred his loyalty. You didn't respond to my mail. What did you want me to say? So you decided to fight. You are truly your father's daughter. Of course, you know that you're not going to win. Uncle, you don't even know what game we are playing. Shall we begin? With your permission, Mr. Chairman, I would like to update the Board on the Ultimate Bet transaction. I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman. I thought we were here to discuss the acting CEO's role. I thought the discussion of my role is linked to Ultimate Bet. Wouldn't the Board like to know the latest? I bought Ultimate Bets. What? This is the recklessness we've been talking about. At every turn, she demonstrates she is not fit. Sports betting is one of the fastest growing businesses in Nigeria. They are no longer giving out licenses. Ultimate Bet happens to have one. I understand that the previous owners were of questionable character, which is why I bought them out. Using our distribution network, I am certain that Ultimate Bets could easily become the leading sports betting company in Nigeria. So who will run it? Look, here at Audere, we back management teams. The Alibies will step down. Victor, their general manager, will stay. We're bringing in a Nigerian, a general manager of Super Bet 365 in the UK, to be our CEO. I will send you his profile. What about the ethics of this, huh? We're enabling a criminal organization. Is that the right kind of message we want to send? The regulator's pass the Alibies. However, the feel they are more due diligence, so we decided to buy them out. But they are criminals. Allegedly. However, we're no longer in business with them. We bought their shares in their legitimate enterprise. That is not illegal. Thank you, Joseph. Mr. Chairman, we can proceed with the meeting. I don't do think we need to anymore. We will reconvene in two weeks as planned, unless you are ready to nominate the CEO right now. We can do it right now. Okay, then go ahead. I nominate Angela. What? Are you joking? I thought long and hard about why my father nominated me and not Uncle Chuka. It's about the future, and Uncle Chuka here, through no fault of his own, is 55 years old, and as such is not the person to lead this company through the next 20 years. I could be that person. I know that now, but I also know that I don't want to be. Angela is that person, and I hope you'll support me. Are you sure? Almost. I mean, all this, this isn't me, and I need to do me. I just hope that, I hope that he'd understand. I'm sure he will. Why? Why not? You do want the job, right? Thank you. Don't thank me, Angela. Succeed. So what are you going to do now? Thank you. Hi, you can take a picture with us. Of course. Call me. Okay. Thanks, Falz. Can you just imagine? She said I should call her. She called me Falz. Who is Falz? Give me my phone Who is Falz? He's not even. How you compare this guy to Quam? Subtitles by explosiveskull
