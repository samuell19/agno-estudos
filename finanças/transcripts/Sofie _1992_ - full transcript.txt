Human lives appear... ...sail for a while with or against the current... ...and then the current closes around their lives again. Again the current closes around their lives... - Good morning, Father. - Good morning, dear. Good morning, Mother. MENDEL PHILIPSEN & SON Iron Mongery and Ropewalk Copenhagen, March, 1886. Precisely at half past eight they cross the street and wave to me. The two people I love most. Then they continue their ritual walk. For them, Kobmagergade is life itself. Here my Father walked with his father on business trips from Sweden where Father lived as a child. During these travels Father visited sailmaker Meyer's and played with the girl who later became his wife. "Oh, those were the days," as Father would have said. Good day. What have you got for us today, my good Cohn? We have a good short loin, Sir. I can see that. Yes, of course. 2.85 kroner. It's dry, Cohn. Dry? If this meat is dry, so is the city lake! He is right. It's a steal at that price. Merchant Frederick E. Philipson requests the company of Mr. Semmy Philipsen, his wife and daughter for dinner. Larsen! If anyone wants me, I'm out. When can we expect you back, Sir? When I am back, Larsen. LADIES' HATS Keep 5 øre. Good day, esteemed gentlemen. Are you waiting for me? Guess what I have in the box? A hat, you're right. Every Friday we celebrate the Sabbath. First in the synagogue then bread and drippings with Grandmother and Mother's sisters: Bellamine, Amalie and Pauline. My aunts in Badstuestraede. Here they come. Aunt Pulle, with her love for the birds those are the happiness of her existence. Aunt Malle, who apologizes to a table if she bumps into it. Aunt Belse, who's sweet on Father and who arranges our "literary salons"after the meal. And Grandmother, who says never to forget where we came from. That our people, although spread around the world, are one in their births. "Fro the morning of time, until the night of eternity." Yes, Semmy. The table is all set. Bread and drippings. "Merchant Frederik E. Philip-son..." "And his wife..." I've already read it. We might hear it in Danish then. Usually, my Danish is good enough for my family. "Merchant Frederick E. Philipson and wife request the company" "of Mr. Merchant Semmy Philipsen, his wife and daughter" "for dinner at our home, Sunday, April 11th, at 7 p.m." How exciting. - I'll wear my red dress. - You'll be the belle of the ball. The brisket of beef is as tender as can be. Try the garlic sausage, Semmy. It's lovely, Father. Let me pass you the stuffed goose neck. No, Pulle. No more. Semmy, taste this. That's enough now, Malle. - I hope you enjoyed the meal. - Thank you, Grandmother. "Let there be obedience in your joints, servitude in your eyes..." "...lean towards me with a love potion." "No, a potion would force you..." "...and I am to be your only master..." "...to accept your broken will as you handed it to me." "You would be my queen and I your slave" "with my slave's foot on your queen's neck." "A woman's love is proudly submitting!" "Love is being weak and dominant." I've found something, too. Something different. "But the women who stayed at home" "never said a word worth listening to." "Their thoughts never strayed from the work in their hands." Did Jacobsen really write that? What are you doing? Reading a book by I.P. Jacobsen. Is he Jewish? I don't think so. Who is his father? His father is Jacobsen in Thisted. He's not a customer of ours. Pay him a visit on your next trip. Fie, you haven't said hello to the birds yet. They're so tiny and sweet. Almost like another little bird. Soon it will be spring, Aunt Pulle. Do you feel different in spring, Aunt Pulle? It's as if I'm waiting for something... ...or longing for something... ...that may never come. What comes, comes, Fie. And what doesn't come... ...isn't worth thinking about. I'll be 29 soon, Pulle. It's as if... ...as if life is passing me by. I'll probably end up a silly old virgin. Look at the little birds. They're so sweet... Will you be proud of me now? I'll be proud of you if you'll be proud of me. What do you think of your little Miss Daughter? - I've seen greater beauties. - Just like the Queen of Sheba. - She didn't get her Solomon either. - Now, let's not be stupid. There comes Petersen with the carriage. Welcome, my dear sister-in-law. Semmy. How is Father's business coming along? You look very beautiful, my dear child. - Mother's brooch. - How that dress becomes you. Meet Harry Hirsch, my son-in-law. My husband's brother, who carries on the family name and business. I've heard all about your charming Swedish accent... The French Ambassador, Monsieur Mallot, and his wife. Ladies and Gentlemen. On behalf of my family: Let us hope that we Danes, now as before, will be at the front of the Danish vigil of arms that lowers the flag for the glorious traditions of proud France. Long live France! Sir, have you heard about the latest in telephone technology? Well, you see... Why are Danes always so eager to please the high and mighty? Most often with some Jew leading the way likes little bugler. I'm afraid the little bugler is my uncle. Forgive me. I didn't mean... Hans Hojby, painter. To tell the truth, I find Jewish culture fascinating... mystical. Their whole heritage... so strange and yet alluring. Do you follow me, Miss? Not quite. Hans Hojby... Oh, I already said that. Sofie Philipsen. Don't expect to find anything mystical about us, my family or anyone else I know. Maybe it's your artistic imagination. You did say you were an artist, didn't you? You haven't heard of me? No. Maybe you're the one who is sparking my imagination, Miss. May I, Miss Philipsen? Are you here by yourself? My mother is the sweet lady with the plume. Over there. And my Father, Semmy Philipsen. He and my uncle lived in Malmö when my Grandfather had an office there. That's why my uncle calls himself Philip-son. My parents met because her father was our client. - She was the sweetest daughter. - I have yet to see the others. So we have a Philip-son and a Philip-sen. But Father still speaks Swedish. He makes my aunts laugh. And me, too... Forgive me. - I'm talking too much again. - No, you aren't. You're so whole. As if you were created in one piece. I want to tell you something. I've never told anyone else. It's my dream to describe the Jewish nature in a painting. Awaken a mood... Come close to the essence of life. And what is that? Infinity. I'd like to paint a picture of a middle-aged Jewish couple in a red Christian VIII sofa against a gray wall with gilt moldings. He looks at her. Just as your father does now. If only I could paint your parents. I know I could paint such a picture. A picture that is life and time in one. When I look at you, at your face, I see your soul. "Free as a bird." I think that's what Heine calls such a soul. A soul like yours has neither past... ...nor future. Only the present. Such a soul enjoys life in the glow of the "now"... ...sees everything from a bird's perspective. Without any strings to Heaven or earth. Do you really see all that? In my face? Pardon me, but I'd like to meet your parents. This is Mr. Hojby. He's an artist. Marvelous evening, isn't it? Has your Miss Daughter mentioned my hope that you and your wife will sit for me? - We are sitting. - Mr. Hojby wants to paint you. Imagine, he wants you to sit in a red Christian VIII sofa against a gray wall with gilt moldings. Mr. Philipsen with a fat "Partagas" and Mrs. Philipsen with her knitting in her lap. We have neither a red sofa nor a gray wall with gilt moldings. And I only smoke "Partagas" on my younger brother's sofa. And I always crochet on my sofa. So you see, that picture can't be painted and we won't be painted. Yes, because I want to paint you. How pretty she was tonight, our Sofie. And so modest. Her cousin could learn a thing or two from her. Well, she's learned something. She's engaged to be married. Don't be stupid, Semmy. That little pompous broker won't go far. My brother succeeds with most of the things he does in life. He'll succeed with his daughter, too. Semmy! I'm so afraid she'll end up like your sisters in Badstuestraede. Even Jonas in Fredericia is better. No, Semmy. You and I should only wish for Sofie to be happy. What are you singing? A song I heard the urchins sing when they saw me. "Listen, little Jew, do you eat pork stew?" Why... ...there's the family. You're in the presence of the better half, Frederikke. - The half with the "O"in the end. - Now, let's not be stupid. Make yourselves at home. Mr. Philipsen in the corner. With a good "Partagas". May I, in turn, offer you a really fine cigar? Try the one on the left. Mrs. Philipsen, please take your knitting. And sit in the other corner. - Does it have to be knitting? - No, whatever you've got. And must it be in the corner? Do as you please. You see, I never knit on the sofa. And when I sit on the sofa I never sit in the corner. Excellent! Mr. Philipsen, lean back and enjoy your cigar. Turn your head to face your wife. Mrs. Philipsen, please look up from your crocheting inclining your head sideways towards your husband. With an expression of serenity and... mental economy. Pardon me, Mr. Hojby. But serenity isn't one of my wife's strong points and she isn't such a good economist either. Yes... Thus we set to work on the masterpiece. Welcome. Let us hear the ultimate verdict. I know it's silly of me. But it just came over me. It wasn't silly. It was beautiful. You were so sweet. That's why. It was as if I saw for the first time what you really look like. As if for the first time, I saw what you really look like. That's the greatest compliment ever bestowed upon me. Welcome to the capital, cousin Jonas. How is the family? Fine, thank you, Semmy. - I've looked forward to this trip. - Much business to take care of? No, I've come to visit you. One ought to consider marriage... ...before it's too late. - Then get married, Jonas. - One has to find someone. A young man in an old company can easily find someone. - Not the first that comes along. - Then take the last. Will you help me get her, Semmy? I... Are you thinking of the one I'm thinking of? That I am, Semmy. - I like your home, Semmy. - We're glad. Feel at home. Have a cigar. Try the one on the right. Slowly, Jonas. That's the way to fight a good Veneciana. Yes. Did you travel all the way in that top hat? No, I took it out of its case when I reached the station. - Do you play, Sofie? - It's been silent for a long time. I can't keep my hands off a piano. Music is my Meschuggas. Play for us, cousin Jonas. - No... - Yes, play for us. - Play your own waltz, Jonas. - Have you written a waltz? I've tried to, at least. What's it called? "The Waltz of Spring". Mrs. Meyer. Thank you for inviting me to your home. The honor is all mine. You should have been an actor. Then you and I could have performed as Romeo and Pulle. Don't forget you're going to the theater, children. I saw the play last season. Oh, it was marvelous! "The passion you so disclaim" "dwells within you all the same." I hope you won't be disappointed tonight after this performance. You would have made a great leading lady, Pulle. A cigar, Jonas? No, thank you. I just want to thank you, Semmy. I've had a wonderful stay. I'm leaving early in the morning... You're always welcome to come again. - But, Semmy, I was thinking... - Jonas? Well? Well. You must have some pros and cons. Well... - What do you think? - It's not quite what we expected. - Isn't a Philipsen good enough? - Now, Semmy. We're forgetting that Sofie is the issue, not us. A drapery-shop owner was not our Sofie's dream. He's Jewish. He has a good name and a good position. Or would you rather have a goy for a son-in-law? If that were the case, God forbid, I'd personally... ...prefer Jonas. One must use one's head. But the poor girl is at her wit's end. Then she has to let others use their heads instead. One shouldn't always listen to reason. To what, then? Feelings! If you had used a little reason maybe you wouldn't be sitting here like birds on a tar brush! That's enough, Semmy! I said maybe. Maybe I could be allowed, my dear son-in-law, to have my say. Thank you. Sofie has been of marrying age for a long time. To my knowledge she has not received any other proposals. She is beautiful and cultured, but beauty and culture are not dowry enough for Jewish men today. So, one has to choose. Either she becomes an old maid like so many others, or else she takes the man she can get. I think it would grieve us all to get a goy in the family. Let her be, Malle. Good evening. - Have a good trip, Jonas. - Sofie? Would you like to be my wife? Sofie, will you promise me to think about it? Goodbye, cousin Jonas. Goodbye, Sofie. Until we meet again? - Have you seen today's paper? - Pardon me? It says the picture of Mr. S.P. and Wife is an "experience". And I thought I'd heard it all. Mother, we're an experience! Oh, are you here? You'll get your lump of sugar. You are an experience, Frederikke! "Mr. Hojby's picture of Mr. S.P. and Wife is an experience." "A typical expression of old-Jewish unity and isolation." Well, I told you so. What is isolation? Can it cause a commotion? No, isolation is... that we keep to ourselves. So as not to cause a commotion. Enough of that, read on. My God, Semmy, there we are! And there we go. I love this city of ours. Don't you, Miss Sofie? All the dark streets full of secrets from the past. Just like people. Don't you feel that no matter how close we humans become, there's always a loneliness anchored in our hearts? As if we were all strangers to one another. I had a dream last night. That you and I were painfully connected. You are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. Thank you for being. The way you are right now... Don't move. I'll remember you like this for the rest of my days. When life and time are one. I can't see you. Are you smiling? Yes. I'm smiling. You no longer look like the woman who cried and leaned on me in the studio. Remember? And I sketched you without your knowing. I knew. Then I beg you... Let me give you that sketch in return for one of the happiest moments of my life. Come. Remember your promise. I haven't promised you anything. No, not with your mouth... But you promised me with something else. No! You mustn't see that. It's awful. It's all wrong. The breasts... The stomach. I can't paint anymore. There's that shadow again... And the look in your eyes... Have you ever felt, "Miss"Sofie, that your dream stays with you long after the reality is forgotten? As a boy I dreamed of the "Forum Romanum". But when I finally came there, it had no resemblance to my dream. Though when I think of the Forum today it's my dream I remember while the reality has vanished. This is our home, Sofie. Why, that's you, Sofie. When did you put that up? Does it look like me? No, not as I see you. There's something I don't recognize. Who painted it? The painter who painted my parents' portrait. It's just Sofie's picture, Mother. She was disappointed that I didn't think it looked like her. What are you thinking, little Sofie? Oh, it's nothing. I was thinking about how things turn out. I'm not so good with words... It's like music. It doesn't have words either. It's inside me. You see, after I lock up the store at night, something happens. It's like music. Inside me. Inside... Do you understand? July, 1887. Dear Father and Mother. My beloved little son shall be called Aron Semmy after his great-grandfather and grandfather. There's the family house, Frederikke. You are welcome here, as soon as you can. I miss you so. From what you told me, I'd imagined it to be larger. You'll get to meet Jonas' mother and his brother, Gottlieb. Imagine, your Sofie has a new family... He's quieting down now. Look, he's happy. Semmy? Semmy, let me show you the changes we made in the store. I'm so happy, Mother. You should be, my dear. Imagine, I've got all three of you with me now. It's time for you to rest. I'll stay with you until you sleep. But coffee's waiting, little Mother. We're leaving early tomorrow and Sofie needs her sleep. No, wait. You haven't heard Jonas and brother Gottlieb sing. - We'll hear them the next time. - Please, just a little song. Sing the one about "Du süsse Maid". "Du bist die Ruh". Yes, that one. No, it's so sad. Little Mother, how did you like brother Gottlieb's singing? Well... Hasn't he got a beautiful voice? I think his voice resembles himself. How do you mean? You'd better ask yourself, my girl. April, 1890. Dear Mother and Father. I'm sitting in our garden, looking at my little boy. And do you know? It's as if I, at the same time, am looking at myself. We melt into a picture of spring. The picture that no one else sees... ...no one else can see. A picture of my hidden world. Imagine. Uncle Frederik bought Hojby's painting of you two. And now you hang in Uncle's elegant parlor. You promised me... not with your mouth... ...you promised me with something else. My mother-in-law has moved into the little loft above Gottlieb. She feels that this is now my home. Jonas misses her very much. He visits her every evening. Jonas lets me help with the daily accounting and sometimes I do it all by myself. Jonas is often tired in the evening. I've asked him to go to the doctor but he says there's nothing wrong. Sometimes there may be too much noise for him here. Aron talks all the time. I am the only one who understands and who has time for everything he says. I try to be a good wife to Jonas like you, Mother, have always been to Father. I so much want us to be as happy as you two are. Imagine... so many years since I stood in the window and, at exactly 8:30, saw the two of you cross the street. But that young lady is no longer there waving goodbye to her loved ones. Give my love to everyone in Badstuestraede. I pray that Grandmother will soon be well again. How I would love to visit them and hear Aunt Belse read aloud and taste Aunt Malle's bread and drippings and see Pulle coddle her birds. There is so much I would like to tell you... ...but I cannot... I cannot find the words to express what I am feeling. I'll go and visit Mother. Hello, darling. A letter from home? - How are you? - Well... schmues. And you, Jonas? I'm so tired... Any answer from Semmy? He says he promised Frederikke never to co-sign any loans. The dowry he gave me for the rebuilding has been a great expense to his own business, he writes. Grandmother is dead. May I lie down beside you? What's a "Jew pig"Mother? Jews are people. Bad people? Some are. But most are good. What does a Jew look like? Like this. We're off, Jonas. I'm sorry you can't go... Well, I could close the store. No one goes shopping on a holiday. A cake, Father. Are you coming with us? Goodbye, my boy. Goodbye, Sofie. How happy you look. And pretty. It's just the two of us. Jonas didn't want to leave the store. We have a half day off at the bank. That's why I support the monarchy. Nonsense! You always say you're the only red socialist in town. The only black one. The sense of color is very underdeveloped in this country. It's better to be blond than red. Being black like us is by far the worst. Dina? No! You're brutal! I'm going for a walk. Do you want to come along? Sofie, go with him. I'll stay here with the children. At least I'll have some peace and quiet for a little while. I feel so... ...trapped. I never told this to anyone, but I know you'll understand. Yes... I feel like that too, sometimes. As if my books bring tidings from a world outside of mine. From a life that I'm not allowed to lead. "Starvation in India" "results in the bubonic plague." "Six million dead." March, 1895. So much has happened. There wasn't time to write before now. We can't afford an errand boy, but Aron helps me after school. You wouldn't believe how big he is. He's my very best friend. I'm managing our store more and more and I think I have inherited Father's business acumen. It gives me such happiness that I can make our store grow through the work of my own hands. Ever since his mother died, it's as if Jonas is homeless. He can sit at her grave for hours. His roots have turned to stone... But he has Aron. Aron often goes upstairs to him. He stays there for hours... Because Jonas isn't well, Gottlieb helps me with the accounts after the store closes. I really don't need him, but it's good to have someone to talk to. I got a letter from my beloved Pulle. As you know she needs to come here and rest in the fresh air. Isn't life wonderful? It is strange. Here we are, you and I. As if no time has passed. And then... it is such a long time ago... Good morning, little one. "We are born into the world with sealed orders." What does that mean? To risk life is to temporarily walk on unsafe ground. But to never take a risk is to lose life. Do you understand that? If you don't dare anything you won't do anything? As usual, Gottlieb and his family visit every Friday evening. But after we heard of Pulle's death Jonas will no longer join us. I miss her so. I experience, for the first time, how the days that come and go here in Fredericia... ...these days... ...they are my life. Do you know what Jonas said after Pulle left? "It's as if a bird's wing had touched my heart." He's a very famous painter. Just as good as Edvard Munch, Aron. His name is Hans Hojby and he lives in Copenhagen. When I was a young girl... When I was a young girl... I hope she's happy, our Sofie. Please wait! - I'll turn on the light. - No, wait. Oh, Sofie... I'm turning on the lamp now. We'll start where we left off. That we will. Mrs. Hansen, December 5th, goods: 27.75 kroner. - Mrs. Hansen, December 5th... - Goods: 27.75 kroner. Mendel Philipsen & Son, in commission: 385.50 kroner. - Mendel Philipsen & Son... - In commission: 385.50 kroner. I can't go on. My hand is trembling. - I'm going to be sick. - Shall I get you a glass of water? Yes, please. Out... ...out... Good day, Mrs. Philipsen. I'm glad you could come. He's not doing well, but you've kept him longer than expected. Cheer up. It's probably the best for him and for you. And for your son. The first corridor on your left. "We"moved, you see. Miss Hjortekaer, Mrs. Philipsen. This way. Time to get out of the whale, "Jonah". He doesn't recognize anyone. Not even me. Jonas, it's the wife. The wife! No, he doesn't recognize you. Death is merciful, as they say. He's been dead for a long time. The final battle awaits him. God's peace, Jonas. Goodbye, Mrs. Philipsen. We, the living, should use life to live. It's time to go home, Dina. Your mother doesn't like your being out this late. Goodbye, Aunt Sofie. Goodbye, Dina. - Come back soon, Dina. - I will. Look what I found at the bottom of my chest. Do you remember? You gave it to Mother. And when I left home Mother gave it to me. In all those years it's been lying here... - ...untouched. - But it's empty. Empty of all except the memories. The rest has evaporated, just like everything else. Such is life, thank God. Are we leaving soon, Mother? Yes. Home... Back home to Copenhagen! I am a poet. Sicily is an island. Right. Italy is a mainland. Right. The farmer ploughs his field. The farmer ploughs his field. Grandfather? I have no school today. Remember your promise. Well, get your coat on, then. ...and there my Grandfather walked with my Mother... I recall my youth here. I think of the long hours where I, trapped between these walls... ...dreamed of the life... ...from which I felt so secluded. Deep inside me, Mother... ...there was a need to accuse the two of you. You, in particular. Because you didn't object when Father wanted me to marry Jonas. You mean the world to me. Fie, dear... All I ever wanted was for you to have a good life. But one can only live... ...if his life has meaning. Mine didn't. Not until Aron. But Aron isn't going to be fenced in. No matter how much I love him. Take care not to do what I did. Take care... ...that your love for Aron doesn't bid you to control him. So you'll experience the life you say you never had... ...through him. FIRST INTERNATIONAL Peace Conference In The Hague PROHIBITION AGAINST AIRBORNE BOMBS Waiter. Keep 10 øre. - Good day, esteemed gentlemen. - Good day, esteemed gentlemen. Grandfather! You're next, my boy. And one day, you, Aron, will meet God and ask Him why the world is like it is. The Lord bless you and keep you. The Lord let His countenance shine upon you and take mercy upon you. The Lord lift His countenance upon you and give you peace. My son... It is so strange to sit here because I was just 13 and believed that Time existed in infinite supply. I didn't know that Time moves on with ever-increasing speed and plays havoc with everything I thought I could leave for tomorrow. We invest so much in our dreams and hopes. And then, in framed photographs, we line up for posterity, next to other pictures. Stare out into space, never to be reached again... Soon I will be an old, white-haired lady, into whose lap someone places a baby, saying: "Smile, Grandma." I, who myself so recently was photographed in Grandmother's lap. I, who was picking flowers just the other day, cannot fathom that it may all be over tomorrow. Seeing you, my boy, here by my side... ...makes me recall when, 13 years ago, you gave me your first smile. And when I, myself a Bar Mitzvah boy, sat by my father's side. It doesn't seem so long ago. I would like to repeat the words of my dear father: "I wish for you, my boy," "that you become a good Jew." And when you ask me what it means to be a good Jew, I'll answer: Love your neighbor like yourself. Your neighbor... That means all your fellow men. We've finished our speeches, so let's enjoy our food. Before we part tonight, I'd like to thank you, dear Semmy, and you, my dear Frederikke. Thank you for this dinner in our old home. The differences in our lives have never broken our mutual destiny. I speak not of the Jewish faith... ...which I see as a thing of the past, an enchanting myth. No, I speak... ...of the blood bonds. No one can take this away from us. Congratulations on your son, Sofie. Hear, hear! FINANCIAL SCANDAL Grandfather? Larsen! Larsen! No whispering in my house! - Grandmother, what happened? - It's your uncle Frederik. He speculated in war materials and he failed. Uncle Frederik is bankrupt. FOR SALE 1,000 kroner. - 1,100. - I have a bid of 1,100. - A bid of 1,500 kroner. - 1,600. I have a bid of 1,600. - 1,700. - 1,700 kroner. 1,750! 1,750... Any more bids? Going, going... sold! Next is Mr S.P. and Wife, a portrait by Hans Hojby. - 500 kroner. - I have a bid of 500 kroner. 700... I have a bid of 1,200. 1,400. 3,000. I have a bid of 3,000 kroner. 4,000! 5,000! 6,000! 7,000! 8,000! 9,000! 10,000! Only 10,000? 11,000! No higher bids than 11,000? Going, going, sold! Why did you cease bidding? It is my dream I remember, while the reality has vanished. Why did I cease bidding? Why do you think I did bid? What do you mean? You can take the picture. It still belongs to me. That's art, Frederikke. The table's all set. Father insists on his bread and drippings, Uncle Frederik. It reminds me of the old days, Semmy. Mother's rolled sausage with thyme and allspice. - We use the same recipe. - Yes, rolled sausage. Well, let's enjoy, children. "My people have suffered for centuries." "They lived in a world of enemies with no allies." "I've felt this all my life before my people," "who still face hostility and hate.'' Maybe Uncle Frederik is right. We have to assimilate. I never thought I'd hear my son say those words. Aron, Uncle Frederik is leaving. Play our waltz for him. Never forget who you are, Aron. Your roots. It's been a real Friday night just like in the good old days. - When dear Mother was alive. - Except for the cigars. Wasn't it nice having Frederik with us tonight, Mother? - Who's that? - Frederik. Stop in when you pass by, Frederik. Larsen, I don't want to be disturbed! These past evenings... ...I've been dreaming. I've been looking at the books, as you said I could. Father... ...I think you should give up the company. It doesn't pay anymore. We must tear down the old walls. Expand into into the office and store rooms. Then we can rent it out. Father, I'm sure we can make a lot of money. I've made some calculations. Oh, Sofie, if only your mother could see you now. Well... I'll send for Levin tomorrow. We'll look at your plans together. And then we'll go to the bank and ask them to sort out the practicalities. When I look at you, "Miss"Philipsen, at your face, I see your soul. "Free as a bird." I think that's what Heine calls a soul like yours. A soul like yours has neither past... ...nor future. Only the present. Such a soul enjoys life in the glow of the "now"... ...sees everything from a bird's perspective. Without any strings to tie it to Heaven and earth. "Free as a bird." And yet my life has been like a closed book which no hand has ever opened. Only fumbled at. Father wants us to being in the candlesticks. Does Father want anything? I want to see the short loin. He wants to see the groceries. Love your neighbor like yourself. From Cohn's. It's dry. If it's dry, so is the city lake! Mother? What did Grandfather whisper to you? He said he wanted to be alone... ...because the soul isn't happy to leave the earth when his love for us holds it back. It's so peaceful here. You know, Aron, when I'm here with Mother and Father... ...Grandmother Meyer lying there surrounded by her dear ones... ...it's as if everything has its natural explanation and connection. Don't you think they'd nod contentedly and sleep on in peace if they could see us here? I don't feel that way, Mother. I need to leave all this, do you understand? I'm not like you. I've been thinking about it for a long time. I can't accept that just because this is how it's always been it must continue to be so. That's why I have to leave. Now go. You don't want to miss your train. Now, let's not be stupid. Have a happy journey, Aron. Human lives appear... ...sail for a while with or against the current. And then the current closes around their lives again. Then the current closes around their lives again. Subtitles: WJJ, N.Y. H. Milsted-Eisenman
