Annie. Daddy? -Dad... -Go back to sleep. Let me hold you. It's okay. It's just me. It's your daddy. It's me! I... might've lost my cool a little. Then I made an ultimatum. Okay. I'm just scared that she's stringing me along. What are you scared of? That she doesn't love me. What are you really scared of? -Being alone. -Yeah. I get it. It can be scary to be alone. "Where there is fear..." "There is your task." "There is your task." Carl Jung had it figured out. That's a good place to end for today. I gotta get my kids to school. It's been a month. It's their first day back. They're a little anxious. Not that they should be standing right outside the door. I feel like such a jerk. None of my shit compares to what you're dealing with. Well, we're not here to talk about me. After you. -You got your pencils? -Yes. Okay. What about your math book? Yes. Wait a minute. Did you brush your teeth? -Yes. Yes. -You did? -Do you wanna use the bathroom, or no? -No. Sadie, come on! We're gonna be late! Sadie... What? Nothing. Looks nice on you. Just put on a jacket 'cause we're gonna... It's cold out there. What if I accidentally swallow it? Then it'll come out in your shit. -It's not gonna come out in your shit. -Back. -Sadie. -Forward. I don't think you should keep pulling it. -Pull it out. -No, don't give her that advice. -What? Yes. -Don't give her that... Don't listen to... No, no, no. Don't... Should I go soft or hard? -No, no, no, don't listen... -Hard. -Put on your seat belt, please. -Okay, jeez. Mom would know what to do. I could pull it out myself. -How would you like that? -What? -Let me pull it out. -What? I'll pull it out right now. I'm gonna pull it out. -You okay? -I'm fine. Have a great day. Hey. Hey, Sadie. I'm sorry about your mom. Sorry about your mom. Sorry, Sadie. You're back. Sorry, Sadie. Hey, Sadie. Sorry about your mom. Hey. Hey. What's up? I still can't believe it, you know? I know. But, welcome back. Oh, my God. That's really stupid to say. Thanks for, like, actually talking to me. Everyone else is staring at me like I have some kind of disease. You're sick? That's so shitty. No, I... Just forget it. You know, I like your dress. I'd wear it if I could pull it off. It's like a, it's like a statement. -Yeah, it's cute. -Thanks. -Yeah. -I mean, it was my mom's. Are you sure that's a good idea? Why am I sure what's a good idea? I just... Wearing her clothes... it seems like it might make it harder to move on, or whatever. I don't wanna "move on." Okay. Maybe you don't want to... -creep people out either. -Nat, come on. -What? I'm just... -Let's not... I'm just trying to help. No, you're being a bitch. Wait, hold on. -I'm sorry. What did you say? -Nat. Nat... -No, what did you say? -I said you're being a bitch. No, no, no, Natalie! Let's not... -Oh, my God. -Natalie, what did you do? No, stop. -Do you need something to change into? -Just leave me alone. -Oh, my God. -You can't laugh at that. -Nat, what the hell? -What? That's okay. You're gonna get there. -Just be patient. -Okay. Well, you've been doing the same thing for 30 years... we've been working together for what? Two? Okay. Okay. Thanks. You got this. I'll see you next week. Dr. Harper? Can I help you? I need to talk to you. I'm sorry, I don't see anyone without an initial phone consultation. -So, you'll have to make an appointment. -Please. If I don't tell somebody, I don't know what I'm gonna do. What's your name? Lester. Lester Billings. Good to meet you, Lester. Come in. I got a... I got a free hour. -Thank you. -Please. You wanna hang up your jacket? Might make you more comfortable. Can you shut it? Excuse me? The door. Sure. I have a few forms I need you to fill out. I use this with all my new clients. This is for record-keeping purposes only. So anything you say in here... is strictly confidential. Is that okay? Is this your first time seeing a therapist? Well, why don't we start with why you decided to see one now? I didn't know where else to go, you know, I... I can't go to a priest 'cause I'm not Catholic. I can't go to a lawyer 'cause I didn't commit a crime. Even if everybody thinks I have. Even if they all think I did it. Did what, exactly? Killed my kids. One at a time. Killed them all. I came to you 'cause I thought that you might understand. I saw the story about your wife in the paper. The car accident. And I know that you know what it's like... to lose someone that you love just like that. What were you saying about your children? What happened to your children? Well, the first one... our baby girl, she... she died from SIDS. I'm so sorry. I can't even imagine how difficult that must have been. You have kids. So, you can imagine. My next two kids died within a year of the first... one right after the other. From natural causes too? Nothing natural about it. Sucked the life right out of them. Even if the first one was an accident... it still made us susceptible. Susceptible? To what? I don't know exactly. I only glimpsed it once. Before my Annie's neck broke. Before they died, my kids... I thought it was just their imaginations getting the better of 'em. And my oldest did try drawing it for me. What is this supposed to be? It's the thing that comes for your kids when you're not paying attention. I'm sorry. Do you mind if I step out? I just need to use the restroom. You believe me, don't you? Of course I do. I'll be right back. Excuse me. Yes, this is Dr. William Harper. I have a man in my office right now who is not well. I think he might be dangerous. Okay, do you want us to send a car out? You there? Sir, you still with me? Yes. Can you please confirm your name? William Harper, yeah. He came in right off the street. -You ever see him before? -No. -Okay. You don't know who he is? -No. No, it's just me. I'm alone in the house. Dad? Dad? -You okay? Are you okay? -Yeah. Okay. Okay, listen to me. Listen, there's a man in the house. -So gross. -I know, right? I think it's gonna come out today. Guys, guys, look! Is that Sawyer's house? I see a dead body. What's under that white sheet? There's cops... Oh, shit! Your dad's not dead too, is he? I should've called you guys right away, the minute he walked in my office. No, he... He seemed sick. He showed me this paper and he had a drawing that his daughter did. There was no blood on his hands or anything like that. He kept talking about this... shadow monster. Shadow monster? He believed it killed all his kids. I've seen it before. Sometimes it's better to have... something to blame... than to admit these things happen for no reason. Hey. It's okay. I don't buy that someone could lose all three of their kids like that for no reason. What's going on? Do you think he killed them? Guilt must have pushed him over the edge. Or the fear of getting caught. Are you sure it was a suicide? Sweetheart, let me handle... Sawyer. Sadie, take Sawyer to her room. -Please. -It's okay. It's all right. It's all right. Let her talk. What do you mean, "are we sure?" Before I opened the closet... I heard these noises. Like a fight or something. An adult man hanging himself in a closet is bound to cause a racket. That's gotta be what you heard. Don't worry about that man, okay? If you get scared, you know where to find me. -Are you tired? -No. Well, it's late and we should go to sleep. All right? There you go. I don't know how you sleep with all these lights. Easy. Like this. Fair enough. All right, love. You sleep well. What's goin' on? Did you check under the bed? No, let me look. Let me see. All clear. What about the closet? I don't see anything. Just can you please check? Definitely. Definitely. And you know what? I will bet you... that there's nothing in there. I'll give you a dollar if there's nothing in there. Five dollars. Okay. Five dollars. You drive a hard bargain. Got a deal. Put it there. No. Dad. Okay. I'm gonna go. Let's see. Well, congratulations. You're five dollars richer. Are you sure? I'm sure. Okay, monster check complete. Good night. See you in the morning light. Hey, Sadie. Just checking on you. Hey. Hi. You okay? I don't know why this had to happen on top of everything else. Does it remind you of when Mom died? Did you have to talk to a bunch of police and stuff? No. You never talk about it. I wasn't at the accident. So there's no one I had to talk to. I just... It doesn't feel real. I keep thinking she's gonna come through that door... with a cardamom tea that smells like shit. You know, I never even... got to say goodbye. Since she died, I feel like... like this weight. This extra gravity. It's just... You have Dr. Weller tomorrow, right? Yeah. You should talk to her about this. I was trying to talk to you. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's been a long day. We should probably hit the hay. I'll see you in the morning. Sleep happy. ...a particular loved one. But just focus on that flame and you can say it out loud yourself. "Spirit, if you are here today... "please bend the flame to the left." Now, just think about the loved one that you would like to communicate with. Just imagine them, picture them in your mind. Think of... About how you feel about them. About how they look. Any strong memories that you have, you have of them. Picture their face. How you feel when you're with them. Our loved ones are with us always. If you're there, bend the flame... -to the left. -Sadie? Hey. You having trouble sleeping? Sawyer? There's something in my room. Sawyer, you were just having a nightmare. Oh, man. You're bleeding. I fell out of bed. Say "ah." Yeah, I found the culprit. Might be time for that little guy to come out. This is what Mom did whenever I had a tooth that wouldn't come out on its own. She said that deep roots run in our family. Don't like letting go of things. So, I'm gonna count to three... and I'm gonna slam the door. On three? Or after three? On three, okay? Okay. -One, two... -Wait! We don't have to do this... I'm so sorry! You said on three! I don't know what happened. Hey, hey, hey. Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ra Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Li Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ra Hush now, don't you cry Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ra Too-Ra-Loo-Ra Too-Ra Loo-Ra-Ra Too-Ra-Loo-Ra Hush now, don't you cry Loo-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ra Hush now, don't you cry What do you think happens to people after they die? Now, what do you mean, Sadie? Do you mean do they go to Heaven? No, that's not what I mean. Are you wondering if maybe your mother is still here? This may seem a little out there, but... when my father passed away... I felt like I could sense him... watching over me sometimes. If you pay close enough attention... maybe you'll start sensing your mom, too. What about other things? What other things? I don't know. It's hard to see. It's like... a dark thing. I see. Well, when did you start seeing this dark thing? Right after that man died. That makes perfect sense. Okay. So, what is it? Well, when there are scary things we don't understand... our minds try to fill in the blanks. But it's just like all those spooky monsters you think are hiding under your bed. But we're going to work on that together. Okay? So, it's not so scary. Now, we talked about this last time. When we have a phobia... or fear something... sometimes the best thing to do... is to face it. And that's what we're gonna do today. So, this light is gonna be completely solid like it is right now. Then gradually it's gonna start flashing... slowly bringing the room down till it's totally dark. So you can see that there's nothing to be afraid of. Okay? I'm ready. Okay, good girl. Let's start. That's not so scary, is it? See? Same old boring office as before. Just you, your sister... and me. You doin' okay? No. Hey, hey, hey. It's all right. It's all right. -You're so close. -I don't want to. No. Sawyer, you got this. It's not real. It's not real. Hey, you're doing so good. It's not real. Good job. It's not real. It's all in your head. Remember, nothing to be scared of. It's all in your head. It's not real. You got this. It's almost over. It's not real. Hey! It was only your imagination. You did it. Sawyer, it's okay. -It's fine. -No need to worry. -It's okay. -Yeah. Now you don't have to do that again. It's not just a fear of the dark. She's claiming to see monsters now. Yep. Yeah, I heard about the monster. We talked about the monster. They want to speak with you now. I think next session would be the proper time. Yeah, I know. It doesn't seem like the right time for me, but eventually I'll come in. We have to talk about your wife. You believe me... don't you? Yeah. I got this under control. Thank you very much. Will, you can't avoid talking about her forever. Guys ready? Let's go. I'm really sorry. I should have never let that man in our house. You doin' okay? Not really. Try to go to sleep. Just trying not to die, thanks. It's all just in your head. It's not real. Sadie? I do this with all my new clients, but it's for record-keeping purposes only. Sadie? Sadie? It's not real. My next two kids died within a year of the first... one right after the other. Even if the first one was an accident... it still made us susceptible. Susceptible? To what? I only glimpsed it once. Before my Annie's neck broke. Before they died, my kids... I thought it was just their imaginations getting the better of 'em and... So, my oldest, she tried drawing it for me. Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ra Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Li Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo Hush now, don't you cry I know that's you, Sadie. Sawyer. What is this supposed to be? It's the thing that comes for your kids when you're not paying attention. You believe me, don't you? Of course I do. No! No, no. No. No! I'm sorry, Annie. I'm sorry, Scott. I never believed you. I never believed you. I'm so sorry, Sophie. I'm so sorry. Get away from me. You get away... Get away from me! Shit! -Hey! What was that for? -That was a mean prank! How are you doing that with your voice? What are you talking about? -Sawyer, it wasn't me! -Liar! -Sawyer! -Liar! Is this the dark thing that you've been seeing? Yeah. Is it real? I don't know. But I'm gonna find out. It was just... Yeah, it wasn't really a big deal, I don't think... -but it was fine. -I have nothin' to wear. But it's, you know, at the same time I think about it, it's like... Drama alert. Guys, be nice. She just lost her mom. I haven't seen my dad in like a year, and I seriously don't give a... Can I talk to you? Yeah. Of course. Alone. Okay. What is her deal? Have fun. Which class y'all got next? I'm sorry about the other day. It was... -Do you wanna make it up to me? -Of course. Yeah, anything. Can you give me a ride? You sure this is the right place? Just wait here. You're not seriously going in? Sadie? Sadie! Hello? Hello? Is anybody home? What? Are you, like, buying drugs or something? No. What... I'm not buying drugs. I know things have been hard for you lately, but I... Just wanna see if anyone still lived here. I really hope not. That'd be, like, the saddest thing ever. What is this place? Sadie, what was that? Wait a second. Coming back now. Sadie, what's going on? Is there someone there? Hello? Hello? Is anybody here? This some kind of a dare? You think it'd be fun to get off on our misery? Maybe get a souvenir. No. I'm Sadie. Sadie Harper. Your husband, Lester, came to see my dad. I just... I wanted to ask about... -What? -This right here. Where'd you get this? I just wanna know what it is. You should pray to God you never find out. Get outta here before you get yourself hurt. My sister saw it. Oh, Les, what have you done? Must've latched on to you now. Goes after the hurt and the vulnerable. Follows you wherever you go. Until you're all gone. That's what happened to your kids? They called it... "The Boogeyman." Yeah, that's the way I used to look at them. Like they were crazy. I found out the hard way I was wrong. It likes to play with its food. Scare 'em to death. Shit, it can even talk like them. Like a goddamn echo. And it needs the dark to stay hidden. Fire was the first thing man used to see at night. It's really been around that long? I think it's been around forever. Don't move. It's right behind you. Don't turn around. Stay in the light. And stay completely... still. I see you, you son of a bitch! Sadie! Hey, was that a gunshot? -Sadie! Sadie! Are you okay? -I'm fine. It's just some crazy bitch. Sadie... Let's get outta here. Sadie? What happened to you? -Sawyer, I can't right now. -Sadie? Wait, what happened? Leave me alone, Sawyer. Sadie, did you see it? There's no such thing as monsters. You need to grow up! Sadie! I'm serious, Sawyer. I need to be alone right... I told you it was real. What are you doing? Where is everything? It's not a good idea for us to keep her stuff lying around. No wonder Sawyer's seeing ghosts. How could you do this without even asking? -Sometimes I have to make decisions... -You're just gonna get rid of all her stuff? -...that you might not understand. -How I feel doesn't count? That's not what I said. -Don't put words in my mouth. -That's how you act! You barely pay attention to anything I say! It's like you don't even give a shit... -about Mom anymore. -You don't know how I feel! So tell me! You're right. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that without asking you. Keep what you want. What if I wanna keep all of it? Then we'll keep all of it. Just take it down to the basement for me. Ral-Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Li Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ral Hush now, don't you cry Just a simple little ditty In her good old Irish way And I'd give the world if I could hear That song of hers today That's beautiful. Keep going. Liar. She loves it. You're such a liar. I have a terrible voice. Mom... if you're here... bend the flame to the left. Please. I could really use your help right now. I have a terrible voice. Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ral Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Li Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ral Sadie. Who is that? Hi. Is that Daddy? Hi. Boop. Boop. Wait. Do you mind? Well, it's not like you're peeing. Not that I haven't seen you pee a thousand times before. What's going on with you? -Nothing. -Come on, it's not nothing. The house I took you to, the gunshot. It's too hard to explain. I'm probably just losing my mind. What are you doing? I'm not leaving until you tell me what's going on. Come on, I'm your best friend. You were my best friend. Now you have all these new friends who are so much cooler. That is not true. They're your friends, too. When was the last time that we hung out? Your mom's funeral. That doesn't count. Well, let's hang out. This weekend even, we can all come over. I don't need a pity party. It's not a pity party. That's not what this is. It won't be. Look, I have no idea what you're dealing with... but you shouldn't be dealing with this alone, all right? Come on. Come on. Yes! So, this is a big night for your sister, okay? So, you see any monsters, you come get me first. Let's give her the night off. That sound okay? And you'll let me sleep in your bed? Yeah, I'll let you sleep in my bed if you stop eating the cheese... 'cause you're gonna be farting all night. Let's make a deal. Okay? I will let you play PlayStation for as long as you want. Screen time is officially suspended. Just let her have a nice night. Deal? Deal. -Deal. Give me the cheese. -Wait, wait. What are you guys betting on? We're not betting. We're agreeing to stay out of the way tonight. Right? Oh, shit. That's them. I look okay? You look... beautiful. You look like you're about to forget all your worries and your strife. Jungle Book. Remember? You used to love that. We used to dance. Bare necessities Just don't say anything, okay? Hey! Hi! Do you have anything else to drink? Like other kinds of soda? No, like alcohol. Sorry, my dad's not much of a drinker, so... That you know of. Nat. Well, I do have something else, though. Like, actual drugs. Wait, what? Okay. Cool. Actual drugs. Since when do you smoke? It was my mom's. Oh, shit. But it's cool. I mean, it's not like she's coming back to get it. You sure? Yeah. All right, this is probably out of lighter fluid. Okay, let me just... Amateurs. There. Now you. In honor of your mom. Thanks. Definitely popping your cherry right now, huh? This is so sweet. You all right? You need water or something? It's all right. -You okay? -Oh, my God. Yeah. I think you need to go to... Are you sure you're good? -Do you need some water? -Take a deep breath. Oh, God. It made you sick? -You feel all right? -I'm fine. -Are you sure? -I'm fine. So cute. Oh, my God, guys! Say cheese! Guys, come on. Don't. What are you doing? I wasn't even recording. Are you sure you're okay? I'm fine. I should make myself throw up. I ate so much pizza. No, it was the weed. It made her sick. Hey, isn't this the closet where that crazy guy hung himself? No, that was the closet in my mom's studio. Could you show it to us? Shit, that'd be sick. Right? Where was he hanging from? He was right around the back of... -What are you doing? What are you... -Nat, come on. Oh, my God. It's called exposure therapy. -Don't! -Guys! -Come on! -Oh, God. This isn't funny! It's not a big deal. Just chill. I have a terrible voice. Please! Please! Oh, my God. Are you okay? -Hey, hey, hey, Sadie. -What happened? What happened? Are you okay? Was there something in there? Was there something in there? No, she's just being dramatic. -Oh, my God! God, Sadie... -What is wrong with you? -...the door would not open! -You psycho bitch! I swear, we were all trying. You are such a liar! -Keep your hands to your... -And you're a freak! Bethany is literally the only person in here who actually likes you. -Literally schizophrenic! -Oh, my God. -She's crazy! -Are you okay? -What's going on, guys? -No! Your daughter is psychotic. I'm so done with her. You are never gonna hang out with her again. She's literally never done anything like... -I can't believe she slapped me! -Dude, are you okay? I mean, she's never done anything... Sawyer. Sawyer. Sawyer. Sawyer. Hey, hey! Sawyer! Sawyer! Come on, come on! Sawyer! Go! Hey, hey. Get 911! Sawyer! It's okay. It's okay. It tried to kill me. -I know. I saw it too. -I had to get away. I believe you. What? I believe you. I'm sorry I didn't before. Where's Dad? He went to go talk to a doctor, but I'm gonna find him. We're gonna go home. No, no, no. Don't go. -No. -Please, don't go. I'm gonna be right back, okay? Hello? Hey, it's Rita Billings. Lester's wife. What do you want? I found a way to get rid of it. How? I need your help. Get over here. We can end this tonight. Sadie? Sadie... Dad? Hey. What are you doing? Nothing. Go back to your sister. I'll be right there. Well, I can tell it's not nothing. They brought Mom here after the car accident. And now Sawyer. This is all my fault. I didn't do enough to help her process it... so now she's having... these manifestations. Oh, Dad, stop. They're not manifestations. Then what is it? What is it? It's real. I saw something tonight. In the closet. What does it look like? -I mean, was it... -It was really dark in there. Couldn't tell. I'm gonna ask you a question, okay? I don't want you to get mad. What? Were you high? I could smell weed on you. A monster in a closet? Know what? Never mind. -You never listen to me. -Wait. Sadie, where you going? To deal with the problem. Somebody has to. I wasn't sure you'd come. I had to. That thing tried to kill my little sister tonight. It must be getting hungry. You're almost out of time. If it's weakness it's drawn to, then we've gotta show it strength. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Watch your step. Spring-loaded firing pins. Wouldn't wanna see your head get taken off. Normally, they're used to scare off bears when you're camping... but they're not normally loaded with live rounds. You think you can kill it? Only one way to find out. No! I'm sorry! I needed something to draw it out! No! -I won't let anything happen to you. -No! You just gotta trust me. Sadie. Told you it could be killed. Sadie! Sadie, help! Sadie, help me! Sadie... Dad? Where have you been? We've been driving around looking for you. You guys are home? Yeah, we just got back. Why? Listen to me, just go back to the car. Go somewhere bright with lots of people. You need to get outta there... -before it comes back. -Wait. Slow down. Dad, you have to listen to me. Okay. I'm listening. Go somewhere with lots of light and lots of people, okay? Dad. Dad? God! Sawyer, it's me! How do I know it's really you? You had your sixth birthday party at Chuck E. Cheese. You ate too much pizza... and then you threw up in the ball pit. Oh, my God. Sawyer! Are you okay? What happened? -What happened? -It doesn't like the light. Where's Dad? It took him down there. We are not going to lose him, too. Sadie... what are you doing? Where are you going? Sadie, don't leave me here. You'll be safe. I saw it bleed. It can be hurt. Maybe we can stop it. Sawyer! Sawyer, get up! Please. Sawyer! Hush now. -No! -Dad! Dad! Sawyer! Sawyer? Sawyer? Sawyer, it's me, Sadie. Look at me, please. Come on. Hey. We're gonna get outta here. -Dad. -Give me that. Grab his arm. Grab his arm. Come on. Get him up. -We've gotta get him outta here. -I can't. Come on. Yes, you can. Come on. Get him up. Get him. I'm sorry. Sadie? Mom. Sadie? Sadie? Sawyer! Fuck you. Goodbye. We're almost there. Come on. I was terrified. To be honest with you... I was scared to be a dad. I was scared. I didn't know if I could handle it. Or if I was ready. Mom made it all look easy. Nothing fazed her, you know? And I... I figured... when I screwed up, that she'd always be there. And then... Then all of a sudden she wasn't. I see so much of her in you girls. So much. I never planned on doing any of this without Mom. No. But I know we can handle it. Yeah. -Right? -Mm-hmm. That sucked. Yeah, because it's bread, and bagels are bread. Sadie, could you come back in for a sec? Dr. Weller? Hello? Can I help you with something? Is everything all right?
