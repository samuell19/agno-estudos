Professor Kumar A - Yes, Principal. We were coming to see you ! Meet new lecturer of our college, Mr. Prakash. Greetings ! - He's a very promising young man. He has joined today. And he is Mr. Kumar. He is Professor of Sociology in our college. He is very well known. Which university did you go to? - Osmania University. Are you from Hyderabad? - Yes, sir. When did you come here? - 2 weeks ago. lt's my first job. Mr. Kumar. Prakash is preparing for PhD. What do you think about helping him after college. l'd be quite happy. Come to my home any time after the college. Oh my God. lt's so hot ! Make-up doesn't hold for a minute. l've asked your daddy to install air-conditioner. He doesn't listen. Chitra. Give me your lipstick. These are so difficult times. lt's so hard to get foreign lipstick. We hear only the names of Max Factor and Yardley now. Be quick, dear. lt's time to leave for the party. l'm ready, mommy ! - Are you ready? ls it your party dress? Sari and blouse of different colors! What will people say in the party? ls she Padma's daughter? People say about me that if it's windy in England, l catch cold in lndia ! But what is wrong with this mommy? - lf it was only one l'd have told. For selecting the dress always pay attention to color combination. Go. l've selected a combination of dress and jewelry for you. Wear that. Take this. Don't take more than 5 minutes. Come in time sometime. Driver - if he forgets, you'd remind him. Do you have to go somewhere urgently? Why would l shout if it wasn't urgent. Ramesh has come from London. His friends have given a party to honor him What will they think if we don't reach in time - unpunctual lndians? What a praise of lndians ! Here's my salary for this month. l've paid the rent for the house. You pay rent even before bringing your salary home. Landlord has never shown his face. And you pay rent on 1st day of month. Padma, payer should be more worried than the payee. Again the same answer. But what happened to air-conditioner? Before installing air-conditioner - we should see our condition too. Mother. Tea. You'd brought the tea earlier. Shall l take the tea to the party? Let's go. We're getting late. Only if people could be free of sorrow before death ... ! Papa, you're tired. Please sit. Give these to me. Rekha. Make a hot cup of tea for me. No Papa. Doctor has asked you not to drink to much tea. l am bringing orange juice for you. l'm allowed to take tea once in a while. l've urge for tea today. Alright. l'm making it for you. Everybody mistreats me in this house. Except you ! Because you are older than me. And you've brought me up like a daughter. l've only brought you up. But l've given birth to Chitra ! But why to blame her. A shadow can't be different from the tree. She is following the footprints of her mother. She goes to parties - and she goes to clubs ! Rekha, don't you ever wish to go for an outing? l can't spare time from my studies. Yes. You've to study for B.A. and you also take care of me. Sometimes l think - who'll be there for me after your marriage. Papa. You don't get me married. - Crazy girl. Every girl has to marry someday. - Forget that, papa. Mother and Chitra will eat at the party What should l cook for you? Cook anything. Years have passed after eating food of my choice. Hey Jyoti ! - What's the matter Moti? Let's go home. - Has Bhabhi given you a gift of child? Not your Bhabhi (sister-in-law). This time cat has given the kittens. ln poor people's homes wife and cats both give birth to children. Come on. l'll give your very hot chilly pakora (snacks) to eat. lsn't my life bitter enough that you want me to eat chilly pakora. So is chilly bitter and liquor is sweet for you? ls that why you drink it so joyfully every evening? Why do you compare chilly with liquor? Chilly changes taste of only mouth. Liquor changes taste of whole life. Why do you cheat yourself? Just think ! You're the son of Prof. Kumar like great learned man ... and you're ruining yourself by drinking liquor. You too have started talking like other people, Moti. Tell me who is there for me in this world. Just me and my loneliness. You've a wife and kids. You can forget your worldly sorrows with them. But who is for me? My ma and papa gave me birth but thereafter ... ? Ma lost herself in the clubs and papa absorbed himself in books. ln stead of my mother l was brought up on the milk of my wet-nurse. When my innocent boyhood didn't get the support of my mother ... then l started on the path leading to bars with my vagrant friends. After that l would roam around in the streets. You tell me what's the difference between me and vagrant orphans? lf l go back home after work - l'm haunted by evil spirits of walls. That's why a drink liquor. l take refuge in liquor. Had l got a little bit of mother's love ... my loneliness would not be looking for liquor in the darkness of night. Liquor won't have become my support, and l'd not have depended on it. lf there were no bars in religious places, where would atheist go. You tell me Moti, where else scraps like me go. Ma ! My good mother ! - You've returned my son ! Why do you have to wait for me at the door every evening? lf l don't wait for you - what else do l've in my life? And this is my childhood routine. When l was a kid, l used to wait like this for your grandpa. Because he used to bring sweets for me every evening. Why didn't you tell me this before. l too will bring sweets every evening. Now all sweetness in my life is because of you. Okay. Now you freshen up, son. Your grandma has made pakoda for you. Really? - Ma ! Parchoo has come. l've come too. - Have you made any special pakoda. Yes - cauliflower pakoda. - Oh yummy ! Cauliflower pakoda were favorite of your grandpa Thank God he liked cauliflower and not chilly pakoda. Otherwise you'd have asked me to eat those today. Ma - you too eat, Not today. Some other time. Chitra, you've got into the habit of making people wait. So sorry, Ramesh. l got a little late. No problem - come on. Ramesh, you're the most noticeable man in this party. Thank you for the compliments. But this party was dull without Chitra. Light has just come. Lo. Dance is starting. Sarita it was wonderful. You've stirred the heartbeats of all. lt was all for you. Sarita, your dance was very good. Shall we go, Ramesh? - Yes. Ramzan Miyan ! - Yes, sir. ls my carriage ready. - l'm always ready for you, sir. But Ramzan, what do you get out of serving a drunkard? l know, sir. You don't drink to enjoy the liquor. You are a noble soul of God. When you hired my rickshaw for the first time five years ago ... l was an illiterate villager then. But traveling between home and work you taught me to read Urdu and Hindi books. And now l can read the poetry of Ghalib, Firaq and Bachchan. What life do you have, Ramzan. You carry my load and this road carries our load. l don't know why poor people are punished to survive? Why? Sir ! Your home has come. Please wake up. Ramzan. Have a cigarette. - May God give you long life, sir. Your home has come. - Help me. Goodnight. - Goodbye. Go slowly. Greetings, sister. - So you've come back ! You're smelling very good. There is only one odor in the world which smells like fragrance, sister. How did you get wet? ls it raining outside? l'd fallen in a gutter, sister. l swear to devil, it is fun to fall after drinking liquor. lt doesn't make any difference whether a man falls in a gutter or a river ! Now move your steps inside. Was l still standing outside? Why do you drink such a thing that you lose control over yourself? That's the beauty of drinking - that hands and feet go out of control but heart and brain go in its control. Why are you touching the feet of a drunkard? You're a drunkard afterwards - first you are my brother ! Brother, if you stop drinking - l shall fast for 21 days. Stupid girl. That would mean that both of us will die hungry. You because of not eating - and l because of not drinking. Death to your enemies. Look, brother. How much slime has gone in your shoes? So what? But it would be less than slime found in this house. Brother! Have you lost your mind under the influence of liquor? ln the house where your respected mother and father live ... can there be slime in that house? Mother and father! Very nice ! Mother is like a foreign madam ... and father is like a philosopher ! Sister. From today you too call mother as madam ! Although she is made in lndia - but she bears stamp of ''Made in England''. l can tolerate all your nonsense - but not any insult to mother. Why are you trying to hide the truth? You want me to respect that mother - who by leaving sacred songs of home... and by singing club songs has turned my father's life into a hell? Had she been my mother, she would have looked after me like a mother ... and she'd have given me good education. A great learned man would not be on an ordinary job in the mill. Being a labor isn't a crime. Man should do good deeds. You're an intelligent man. You understand this world. lf you stop drinking, then everybody will respect you. You are a kid, sister - a simpleton. Respect ... ! ... ! Respect is something which once sold can't be bought back again. And l had auctioned away my respect long back! Go ... you're wasting your study time. Come on, brother. Have some food. Today, drinking has served me as food. l'll eat tomorrow. No. Food is getting cold. Come with me. Food is getting cold in the room. lt was a good party and dancing. We enjoyed it very much. They have come with a bang ! Elder madam! Younger madam !! Sometime when ma is in mood - l will certainly ask her ... as to how many minutes after giving me birth she had gone to the club? Shut up brother. Eat the food. Come ... First let me change these dirty clothes. Rather you go. l'll eat the food. - Will you surely eat? Was daddy asking about me? Master waited for you up to 1 1 PM - then he ate food and went to sleep. Don't tell daddy that l was late. Where are you coming from, Pachoo. - l had gone to the Hanuman temple. Here is his offering. - Give it to me. No. Open your mouth. How come son that you remembered Hanuman today. Ma, people go to the temple when God remembers them. Otherwise, why will people of modern times remember God This Kalyug, my son. lsn't it Sunday today? - Yes, ma. Then sit with me. l'll recite Ramayana for you. No ma. l've to go for taking a tuition today. Tuition? You're a college lecturer. Are you going to teach someone? No, ma. l'm preparing for the PhD. A senior professor of my college has promised to help me in studies. He is a very nice man. He'll teach me on Saturdays and Sundays. Had your father been here, there would be no need for you to go to others. Ma. How many times have l told you not to mention me about father. One who has given you birth - what's the harm in hearing about him. You have given me birth, ma. l know only you. Why to hear about such a father who has not even seen face of his child? One who left his wife even before his child was born ? lf l ever meets him - l'll catch his throat and ask: ''What was my mother's crime?'' But l don't know where he is hiding? Cool down, son. - Ma. My son! One gets only what fate has decided. l've also suffered the separation from my husband. When he deserted me ... l was pregnant. l didn't commit suicide because one more soul would have gone with me. And when you were born - a son's love made me forget my husband's love. Time is very powerful, son. lt causes the wound and it heals it too. But ma, every child wishes to call someone as his father. Someone in whose lap he can play - and help him in his old age. l was going to meet a great man, and you mentioned a mean person to me. Alright! Bless me, ma. - May you live long, son. Parvati! Prakash has so much hatred in his mind for his father. Yes, ma! l too sometime think - if he meets him somewhere - nobody knows what he might do! What are you doing, Prakash. We touch feet of only mother, father, teacher and God's statue in the world. l don't have father. But l went to the temple and took mother's blessings. By touching the feet of my Guru, my life has become glorious. l've brought God's offering for you too. Why else a student could bring for his teacher. l'm very glad to know that you follow our old culture in these times. The mother who has given birth to you must be great. You too are great, professor. You're showing me the light of learning without taking anything. lt isn't so great. Medicine, grains and knowledge should never be sold. As far as possible these three things should be given freely. Come on, Rekha. Why did you stop? He isn't a stranger. He is Prakash. He is a lecturer in my college. He is preparing for PhD. He'll come to me often for studies. And this student has brought offering for his Guru. You too take it. Papa, take this juice. Juice! l thought Prakash has come - so with him l too will get tea. Please bring two cups of tea. Papa, why do you forget that you're not suppose to take too much tea. l know that, but what's wrong in drinking little bit tea. Bring tea. l'll bring only one cup. You can't get away from me. That's what l am seeing. Every father becomes a child before his daughter. You're quite right. But in fact she is not my daughter. Perhaps you're puzzled. lt's an old story. Rekha is the daughter of my very close friend. When her mother died, her father couldn't bear his wife's death. He passed away when Rekha was only one year old. Since then she is with me. l've two children of my own too. A son and a daughter. Jyoti and Chitra. But they ... Perhaps l'm boring you. - No... Rather l'm happy to get to know your family. So l was saying. l've brought up Rekha like my own daughter. She's studying for B.A. and as you saw she takes care of me like her child. Honestly, sometimes l feel as if Rekha was my mother in previous life. Anyway. Let's start our work. - Yes. There is a book on Theory of Upheaval Fetch it. Doctor, l'm having the same kind of pain again. Jyoti, how often will you come in this condition. What can l do doctor - these two things don't leave me alone. First is my life and another is this pain. You very well know what is causing this pain to you. Don't tell me that - give me an injection quickly, doctor. Why are you knowingly hurting yourself, Jyoti? Liquor has damaged your liver. ln spite of that l've been living. But what is the use of living in such pain? l too know that, but where from can l bring happiness in this life? ''How do people live Tell me friends ... '' ''Teach me the style of living my friends ...'' You ! Please sit. Where is the professor. - He's gone out for an urgent work. He would be back soon. Please sit. You too sit please. - First you. What will you drink? - No, nothing. You were writing something. Have l disturbed you? No. Papa is writing a book - l was copying it. That means your handwriting would be very good. What makes you think so? - Because girls are pure hearted. When heart is clean - so would be the hand. You mean boys aren't clean hearted. Often, that is the case. - Not necessarily. What is this noise? Mother was expecting some guests for tea. Perhaps they've come. Where are you, Ramu? Please sit here. l'll make some tea for the guests. Chitra ! - Yes. Looks like God has made you with his own hands. Where did you buy this antique. l'd bought it at Agra when l had gone there to see Taj Mahal - l paid Rs.700 for such a small piece. l'm used to eating, wearing and buying good things since childhood. l've been telling Chitra too to get used to good things in life. You're right. Telephone was also on your side. Which perfume are you wearing today? But why are you becoming so intimate. lt isn't my fault - it is the perfume that's attracting me to you. Let's go out, Chitra. - Where will you take me? Anyplace where ... - Haven't you got tea yet? Ma. l've brought the tea. Chitra. Who is she? Rekha. What are you waiting for? Keep the tea and leave. Yes, ma. Auntie, you didn't tell me who is she? She is an orphan. She lives with us. Makes tea etc. Drink tea. lt's getting cold. Tell me one thing auntie. Why orphan girls are so beautiful? Because they eat unearned food. Drink tea. Come on Chitra. Let's have tea. Rekha ! - Yes, ma. l'd called Ramu to bring tea. Why did you come there? Ma. Ramu has gone out to bazaar. Then you should have told me. l would have taken the tea. Where guests are in the home you should not come there. Got it? Yes ma. lf you say - l will not come. lf you come l'll break your back. You've become very fond of exhibiting yourself. So you're finishing my work. So what? lsn't it the duty of a student who takes free tuition? Can l see your handwriting. - Sure. Your heart too is very clean. - Thank you. Here, eat some biscuits. You take first. - No. You first. Take it now. Tell me what's in my hand? - Shall l? My fate is in your hand. - But what thing do l hold? What can be bigger than the fate? - Look at this ! lt's very beautiful. - This means your luck is beautiful. Put it on ! - No. You got to put it on my finger. ''This gift of your love is ... lovelier than my heart and life.'' '' Be wearing your ring the star of my fate has brightened.'' Chitra, you sing very beautifully. - Really? Your voice is magical. - And. And you are very beautiful. Have you ever gone to Kodaikanal? - No. Daddy neither goes himself nor allows us to go. How is that place? - Just like heaven on the earth. And we have a beautiful bungalow there. How enjoyable it would be if both get lost in its natural beauty! Shall l make a program for next Sunday? - Who else will go? You and l. Who else? Will mommy let me go alone? Will we've to take mommy too? Anyway. We'll take her too. Your mommy is quite a modern woman. She won't come between to lovers. Shall we go now. Mommy must be waiting for me. Shall l drive. - Yes. Very bad. This daughter of learned Professor Kumar ... and sister of the man of men brother Jyoti ... ! Ramesh gave me this ring ! Chitra, my desire is granted today. - Today, l am very happy too. Who can measure my happiness. My daughter will go into the home where she'll walk over wealth. Who was that boy? - Judge Kailash Nath's son Ramesh. He's notorious and has no respect for any woman. What were you doing with Ramesh in the park yesterday evening? What was l doing? l love him and l'm going to marry him soon. Do whatever you like after marriage. Why do you insult your father before. l've told you not to come here. What have you to do in this room? Ask your beloved daughter not to go out with that judge's son Ramesh. Rather than going out with a judge's son will she go out with a mill worker? So it's going on with your permission! - Yes. lt's with my permission. Whatever you've done to me is okay, but don't play with her life. Shut up. How are you concerned with this home? What's my concern? Have l no concern with my father's honor? lf you've concern for your father's honor, why do you work in a mill? Because my father's reference l got a designer's job in the mill. Had l taken your name, nobody would have employed me even as peon. l don't go and tell anybody that you are my son. For the first time in life you have spoken this truth, ma. But why are you putting my innocent daughter on wrong path? l say will you shut up or not? You can stop me from saying this - but who'll stop other people? This devil of modernism on your head will destroy our family someday. Come with me, brother. - Remember these words. Rekha, l'm telling you that someday a big earthquake will come in this home. Before this you used to come drunk from outside. Now you drink at home too! ln the home where sins are committed in broad daylight ... what is wrong in drinking in that home? Do you understand now why l drink? Why do l drink, Rekha? You too won't understand, Rekha. Ma. How did this photograph of a girl came in our house? Did you see it, son? - l saw it that's why l'm asking Do you like her? - l'm asking - who is this girl? First tell me - do you like her or not? How can l judge from a picture, ma. l mean how does she look? - Same as any girl. Your grandma has chosen this girl for you. She is polite, good natured and from a good family. And she has studied up to B.A. Only your approval is needed. But ma. There is a very big obstacle in the way of my marriage. What kind of obstacle? According to Hindu religion - isn't father's name needed for marriage? Why not, son. - Whose name will l give, ma? l've neither seen my father nor you've told me his name until today. And even if you tell me, l'll never utter that man's name. The man who has strewn thorns in the life of my mother. Son. Won't you forgive your father all your life? l know that to err is human and it's our duty to forgive. But even being a human - l can never forgive that man ... ! Who knows whether my father is dead or alive? Don't say that. For God's sake don't say that. l've full faith that my god is alive. Only one symbol on your head makes me believe that my father is alive. My son, only my funeral pyre can remove this vermilion. Only my funeral pyre ... ! Ma. You're living with a beautiful mirage. Whenever l think about your devotion and sacrifice ... then l consider myself fortunate in taking birth from your womb. Ma. l'm prepared to give you every happiness of the world. ''Has life of the poor any meaning ln heat and cold it's only sweating.'' Greetings, manager. - Welcome, professor. Please have a seat. How can l help you? l've come to deposit the rent. - Oh ! Today is first of the month! Yesterday, l saw Miss Rekha's current account. There are about Rs.80,000 in her current account. Yes, l know that. Why don't you put it in a fixed deposit? You can earn good interest. ln fact manager, l'm against taking interest. That's right. But perhaps Miss Rekha may not ... lf you don't mind, may l ask who is Miss Rekha for whom you make deposit? She is my friend's daughter. He died some 20 years ago. Before dying he gave me 1 .5 lakh which l used for buying this house. That means Miss Rekha is your daughter. - Of course. Then why does she take rent from you? She doesn't even know that this house belongs to her. This secret will be opened on her marriage day. Have you seen any boy for Rekha? l've a boy in mind. He's lecturer in my college. He's very promising boy. l think l'd use some of Rekha's saving to send him abroad for doing his PhD. You're great. There are people of your values in this world. Anyway. l'll be going now. Prakash would be waiting for me. Please have this rent deposited - Sure. Greetings ... ! Papa has gone out to the university library. He has asked you to wait. Please sit. Why is so quiet in the house today? Ma and Chitra have gone out to a hill station. ls that so? - Do you go to hill station in summer? Who doesn't wish to go to a hill station in summer? But l can't go. - Who stops you from going. My duty. Perhaps you don't know that my mother has lost her sight. She can't see. And l can't leave her alone. This is very unfortunate. But how about your father? l don't know anything about him. - What do you mean? l've never seen him. l had left my mother before my birth. l know how you must be feeling. l am like you too. l know. - How? Professor had told me. - l understand. But there is a very big difference in your story and my story. ln absence of my father, papa has given so much love to me that l think ... had my father been alive he could not have given me that much love. There is no doubt in this, Rekha. Forgive me. l spoke your name so informally. There could be nothing better than unintentional informality. Who else is in your home besides your mother? My grandma. Can l see your mother someday? l will be delighted. When will you come? Whenever you will take me. For this l will have to take permission from the professor. Are you afraid of papa? l'm afraid of your papa - as well as of you. Do you fear me? l don't know about bad people. But l fear all good people. But l am not good. Your papa gave the certificate of your goodness long ago. Papa praises me unnecessarily. lf l go to your home - will your mother have any objection? Sure she will have. Ma will be angry me as to why l didn't bring such a good girl before this? My earlier impression was that you're a very quiet kind of a person. But you talk many things. Greetings, sir ! - Oh, you ! Have you been waiting for long? - No. l came just now. l've brought this book specially for you. Prakash ! - Yes, sir ! Something has come to my mind. - Please tell me. After PhD, why don't you go to Europe for higher studies. l too wish that but higher studies in Europe will cost too much money. Prakash, you're like my son. Don't misunderstand me. l'll arrange the money. Sir, you've already obliged me a lot, and you've your responsibilities too. l don't want to be a burden on you. lt's not that Prakash. My hands are empty and what can empty hands give. What l mean to say is that there is one way out. l'll tell you clearly. There is a daughter of my friend. lf you marry her, you'll inherit all her property. What is your answer? l'm not proposing for some ordinary girl. She is from an honorable family. She has everything - property, good education and character. l'm confident that your life will be full of light after marrying her. Sir, who doesn't like to go to Europe? But l believe in a few principles in life. One of that is that man should see the word by standing on his feet ... not by riding on someone's shoulders. And if l get education with the help of some girl, what'll be its use? As you like. Sir, you won't be angry with me. - No. Absolutely not, Prakash. Marriage is a personal matter for everybody. And if these are your principles, l don't want to force you. This book is very important. You must read it and prepare notes. Why didn't you accept papa's proposal? Did you hear everything? ls money everything in life? Even if honey is fed forcibly - it will taste bitter. But papa was talking about your welfare. l know that. Have you decided something else for your future? Perhaps you're talking me into saying what l'm anxious to say. But l'm unable to say. - What is that? lt's a very lovely thing but it slips away right after coming to my lips ! You're talking in puzzles. Shall l say it clearly. But there is one condition. What? l don't like when you address me with respect. But if you call me as Prakash - you'll have your answer. Will calling you as Prakash ... ? Forgive me. lnattentively l spoke your name. So this inattentiveness means that l'm somewhere in your thoughts. Do you understand now why l refused your papa? lnstead of you, why did your papa propose about another girl? Darkness under the lamp ! Go. l'll never talk with you. Do you like our bungalow? - Yes. lt's like heaven. lt wasn't heaven. lt became after you came. Let's go out somewhere. - Shall l ask my mommy? Would you go out with us? - Stupid. Will you take me everywhere? Why? Don't you want to see Kodaikanal? Have l come to see Kodaikanal? - What else have you come for? To see how your love for Ramesh proceeds towards the marriage? You're still sitting here. Don't you want to come with us? lt's very cold outside. Both of you go out. lsn't it cold for us? You're young kids. Young aren't affected by cold. Will it look nice if l go alone with Chitra? Do l consider you as a stranger? l trust you fully. Thank you auntie. l'll always value your trust. Let's go Chitra. ''Had your eyes not conveyed your love My heart won't have fallen for you.'' Are you feeling cold? - What do you want? Heat. - Not like this. Did it end your cold? Not fully. - Naughty boy! Ramesh! When will we get married? During summer vacation. Now you too are shivering with cold. Ganga ! - Yes, Madam. Ramesh and Chitra haven't come back yet! lt's raining, madam. l fear that they might fall. Chitra, it's very hot here. l'd like to go back to Kodaikanal. What is the matter. You came back very soon. l was afraid of you. Looks mountain air has changed you. Otherwise why will you be afraid of me. Anyway. Here is this month's salary. - You must have paid the rent. Yes. A Jeweler had phoned saying certain ornaments are ready. Yes. l had ordered. - But where will money come from? Don't worry about that. The publisher who is releasing your new book ... l took advance from him and paid to the jeweler. What have you done, Padma? l do everything as you like. Every month l give all my salary to you. ln all my life l haven't spent even a quarter on me. l had this one book which l thought l owned it. You have even taken the money for it. l haven't given it to my mother. - That isn't the question, Padma. You haven't taken my money but you've destroyed life of those poor students... for whom l was going to set up a scholarship from proceeds of this book. First provide for your home - then think about charities. Charity begins at home. How to make you understand? Today your mouth and words were stinking. Alright - it was fragrance. Go and sleep immediately. Brother, please lie down. l can lie down, but l'm not able to sleep. Try it. You'll be able to sleep You tell me how can l sleep? My ears have become deaf due to the noise of the machines l hear all day. Drinking has shrank my eyes. There is no way for the sleep to go into these small eyes. Brother, only you can understand what you've been saying. l quit. But look. Where're you going? Come! - What is it? Take it. See. - What is it? Open it. Wow ! Sari !! lt's beautiful. lt's border is very beautiful. lt's sari's border. Not the border of Mysore and Maharashtra to fight about. Brother. You connect one thing to another. Tell me where this sari was made. - lt was made in our mill. And you'll be very happy to know that its border was designed by me. And this was my first design that was approved by the mill. And this is the first sari of that design made by the mill. And brother, you've done the first good thing in life. And sis, l compelled the mill to name this design as Rekha design. When women ask for Rekha design saris in the shops ... that will make me very happy that people are taking my sister's name. Go. Change into this sari soon - l want to see you in it. No. Mother and Chitra too are in this home why did you bring it form me. Stupid. This Rs.10.60 sari won't be approved my lovely mother and Chitra. This sari is for poor girls - go and wear it. You unnecessarily wasted Rs.10.60 for me. l don't want it. No. Don't refuse me. - Don't force me. Leave me alone. No Rekha - for my sake. - Nothing for you. Move. Look Rekha, if you are obstinate - then l'm no less obstinate. lf you don't listen to me today - l'll eat poison. No let me go. - You must do as l've said. What is this brazenness. - Ma. Why do you call me ma. l'm not your mother. You dishonored our family by working in a mill - but l tolerated it. You spent nights in bars - l tolerated that too. But what l saw today with my eyes - even devil will be ashamed to see it. Mother ! What are you saying? Like all other days, l came to open door for brother Jyoti. How do l know what goes on here everyday? But today l saw with my eyes. - Ma ! Will any good thought ever come to your mind? l was giving a sari to Jyoti. lf you had to give her a sari - you'd have treated her like a sister. She may not have taken birth from your womb but she is my sister. She isn't Chitra. She is Rekha. She was born only to care for me. lf someone else had spoken like this about her, l'd have taken her life. Does anybody behave with his mother like this after drinking? ls this the way to treat your sister. Shameless. Mean. How long will you insult this family by living here. Ma, don't stretch the matter further - there was no such thing. You too are siding with this drunkard. l've asked you many times not to allow this drunkard to enter this home. lf he had spoilt your life under the influence of liquor people would say ... that l do everything for my daughter - but l've kept you an orphan in home. People would have spitted on my face. You've spitted on my face, ma. All of you have treated me like orphan. Only Rekha gave me love of a mother and sister and you're sullying her name ! l should go away from home where such wickedness is prevailing. Who is stopping you. Why don't you go. Get out of here. Ma. You've always spitted poison. lf you had to throw me out of home you'd have done so in childhood. Then at least l would have become some man by now. l am going. l'm going, Rekha. Brother! Where are you going so late in the night? Don't go, brother. Rekha. lf you need me sometime - you'll be able to find me somewhere. ''Whatever the fate had to offer l've already drunk all that.'' ''Now it is time to die l've lived as much as l had to live.'' Master. l had left you in your home - what are you doing her at this time? l've been thrown out of my home. l've no home or shelter. No need to worry, Master. When your friend Moti will help? Come with me. l'll pick up that. Who? Jyoti brother ! Come in. So late in the night! Those who lose their way come in the night. Moti is home, isn't he? He is working night shift today. Then his bed would be empty. - Yes. ln a way it is good. My eyes are tired due to lack of sleep. Today l will sleep here. What is the matter, Jyoti? Ask about it in the morning Let me sleep now, sister-in-law. Have you eaten? l ate as soon as 7 PM. A full bottle. l'm not asking about the bottle. Have you eaten food? Food? Food is for the hungry. l filled my stomach with colored water. l've rice, beans, papadam, pickles etc. everything in home. Eat a little bit. By talking about food don't spoil the taste of liquor. From tomorrow, l will eat twice a day. Eat four times. There is no dearth of food for brother-in-law in my home. Here is a pillow. Ganga ! - Yes. l'm coming. Jyoti ! When did he come? At one in the night. He has come with his baggage. Only difference between Lord Ram's exile and Jyoti's exile is that ... he doesn't have Sita and Lakshman with him. Did you feed him any food? He had eaten at 7 PM - a full bottle. - l'll slap you. Did he eat anything after coming here? l had everything to feed him, but he didn't agree. His gate was unstable and eyes were heavy with sleep. He went into a deep sleep. - Unfortunate man. Came hungry from mother's home and slept without food in your home too! Okay Kamala, prepare lot of parontha for the breakfast. Bring a pillow for me. Let me straighten my back too. Fetch me the red book from that corner. How long will you write, it's getting dawn. ls it dawn? ln my work l didn't realize. Didn't you give me my medicine last night? Papa. For the first time last night l made such a mistake. What is the matter, Rekha? Why do l see tears in your eyes? Nothing Papa. l was upset last night so l forgot to give you medicine. Are you so upset because of medicine?. Tell me what is the matter? Nothing, papa ... ! Rekha, tell me the truth. Brother Jyoti left the home last night. - Why? Because of me. l don't understand, Rekha. Jyoti had brought a present for me. A cotton Sari - that he had designed. He was insisting but ma misinterpreted it and she told him to ... Quiet down, Rekha. l can understand what Padma would have said to my son! But the sad part is that first time in life my son did something good and he... was punished so much that he had to leave the home! Papa, why did Jyoti leave the home? l should have left the home. Don't say that, Rekha. Rather we all shall have to leave this house someday, not you. All people have to suffer the punishment for their misdeeds. lt's wrong to think that they have to go to hell or heaven after death. Hell and heaven is right in this life. ln this world. Hey Kamala! Have you no shame? Don't you see a guest is in the home? Even dreams of poor people are about their wives ! Rekha hasn't even gone to her bed. Yes brother - l'm going to sleep now. Hey Jyoti. Wake up. Have you come back, Moti. - Yes, l'm back. l have been thrown out of my home, Moti. l'd guessed it by your coming here at midnight with your baggage. Either you left home or they threw you out of the home. Your both guesses are right, Moti. - Mother said get out - you walked out. You know it all, Moti. Can l live here until l find suitable accommodation? Sure, you can live. Kamala, bring my cane. Cane ... ? - Yes ! l'm bringing. - Bring it quickly. Hit it on his head - Why? To bring sense to the professor's son. He is asking - ''Can l live in this house?'' Really? Then it is okay. lf brother can't live in his elder brother's home will he live in an inn? When l, Kamala, Billoo, Tilloo and others can live in this house ... Who are those others? - Only one - l can't take her name ... ! When all of them can live - Why can't you live in this house? l too can live. l just asked by mistake. Kamala, you bring some tea. Director Ramesh would be there - please call him to the phone. What, he isn't coming for 2-3 days? ls Director Ramesh there - l am Chitra speaking. He hasn't come! Who are you, dear? l'm Professor Kumar's daughter Chitra. Which Professor Kumar - who teaches in the university ? Yes ! - Come dear ! No. Thank you. Where is Ramesh? Why? What is the matter? l've come to take donation for my college function. But, he is out to Kodaikanal. Kodaikanal? - Yes. He often goes there. But why are you sad? Tell me how much donation do you want? l'll give you. No sir. When he comes back - l will take it from him. Farewell. - Farewell, my child. Where have been since morning. - l went out to Usha's home, mommy. Why have you been sad for past day or two? Your face has lost your usual brightness. Not really. l want your permission for something. What kind of permission? l want to go for picnic to Kodaikanal with my girlfriends. So why are being sad? Have l ever stopped you from going anywhere. l too like Kodaikanal very much. l will also go with you. No mommy, all my friends are going alone. Let me also go alone. That far? How can l let you go alone? l won't be alone, mommy. So many girls are going with me. Okay. Go. But be careful. Call me as soon as you reach there lf you've time go to Ramesh's bungalow. Ganga will be happy to see you. l'm starving - but Moti hasn't come so far. You can eat. He'll later. No, let Moti come. - l've come, Jyoti. We'll eat later - Why? l'm not too hungry. But brother Moti is starving. Let him starve. lt isn't his mother's home that he can eat anytime. You go to the kitchen. - Alright. Jyoti. Come here. See what l got for you. Soda ! - And this ... Brandy ! - Yes. You've always be lecturing me - and you drink in hiding ... ! You think l'm a drunkard. My dear. l thought a friend is living in home as a guest ... and that too a drunkard guest - so l bought this for you. lf a friend doesn't car about a friend it isn't friendship. May you live long and thank you. But l've stopped drinking. Have you stopped drinking? Hey Kamala. Come here for a moment. What is it? - Look out - is there sunrise? Why are you kidding? Does the sun rise in the night? lf Jyoti can stop drinking then the sun too can rise in the night. So has my brother-in-law stopped drinking the red wine? Jyoti, swear by me, else l won't believe. l swear by your sisterly love - l've stopped drinking. May you live long. l'll butter your bread on both sides. But put some of your jam too. - You naughty boy. What is it, brandy? He stopped and have you started? Billoo's ma. l brought it for him. Give it to me for safe keeping. When Billoo was born doctor had asked me to take one spoon every day. lf another baby is borne then it will come handy. Full stop ... ! Ship is already full! Go and serve the food. What is this? - You'll know soon. One ... ! Two ... !! Three ... !!! Four ... !!!! Five ... !!!!! Where is sixth ? - Why are you asking me? Here he comes. Ma ! - Who is that? Please sit, ma. My name is Rekha. l'm adopted daughter of the professor who teaches your son. Really. Sit, my child. So you're the daughter of Prakash's Guru. Prakash also praises him very much. lt's hard to find such selfless people in the world today. Has he sent some message for Prakash? No. l've come only to see you. To see me? - Yes, ma ! Prakash praises you so much that l've been anxious to see you. My child. Your voice speaks the language of your heart. So soft, so sweet. You must have very good hear too. l think God has sent you to this home for some reason. As it is the will of God - why shouldn't l welcome you. Ma. You have given your blessings - l got everything with that. May you live long, dear. You may never see hard time in life. You've come for the first time - l'll bring some sweets for you. Prakash is also about to come. You sit. l'll be back soon. l think God has sent you to this home for some reason.] As it is the will of God - why shouldn't l welcome you.] ''l've done a wrong - Punish me as you like.'' ''ln my dreams l did mischief with you.'' ''l've punished you with life imprisonment.'' ''ln my dreams You did mischief with me.'' Oh, madam ! Hasn't you mother come with you? No. l've come alone. Where is your boss. He has gone out with the madam. - Madam ! Which madam? - What can l tell you ... ! Whosoever comes with the Master - l call her as madam. Every time a new madam comes. How can l remember their names? Please sit. Master will come soon. What would you take - tea or coffee? - Nothing. You haven't eaten anything. Take some tea and biscuits. No, l am not hungry. When shall we get married? - During summer vacation. Summer vacation? - Yes. You're shivering with cold. Come close to me - you'll become hot as amber. You've come here! - Hi Chitra. How are you? Now l know why you like Kodaikanal. lt's good that you've understood. Why had you to come here? l hadn't seen you for many days. l came here searching for you. l was afraid perhaps you've forgotten your promise. Promise? Which promise are you talking about? Which promise! Didn't you promise to marry me in summer vacation? Had you made any promise to her? Will you marry Chitra? Sarita, you too have become mad. Will l marry her? Why people blame me with such beautiful lies. Lie? Ramesh, only a month or two ago you brought me here saying you love me. You had sworn by my love to live and die together for life. Speak softly. l might lose the trance of wine. This poor girl thinks that people are borne only to get married. But she doesn't know that burr isn't meant for one bud. Daily in the garden many buds become flowers. Then why did you give me this ring? - Ring? Because there was no ring on your finger. Had l known that you are playing with me ... l won't have allowed even your shadow to touch my body. Don't cross your boundary, Chitra. l've already crossed the boundary. That's why l'm crying over my fate. l had thought that you're a boy from a good family. You will be my good soulmate. Your attractive face and sweet talk has trapped me. Had l known that it was the face of a cheat ... l would not be begging you for marrying me. Who has asked you to beg me for marrying you? You can go back the same way as you have come. What if l don't go? - lf you don't go then ... ! No Ramesh, don't throw me out of your life like this. l don't see Chitra with you these days. ls she alright? How have you started thinking about Chitra today? l knew that's how you'll answer. How many days have passed since Jyoti left home? You didn't ask about him. Jyoti is a boy whereas Chitra is a young girl. So as a father l'd to ask where is Chitra, and what has happened to her. You're making a mountain of mole. Chitra has gone to a hill station. With whom? - Alone. Are you satisfied now? - Satisfied? You've sent a young girl alone and you're not worried! Do you want to confine Chitra in the kitchen all 24 hours like Rekha? Had you moved in social circles you would know how the world has changed. Perhaps you're talking about the society where young girls go out alone. Where the girls dance with young boys in each other's arms. The society for which women leave their homes in the care of servants. That's why l cry. Like a pond's frog you remain locked within your library. Have you ever hold your wife's hand lovingly and taken her to a club? Have you ever taken any of your child to the movies. l'd have been happy had you asked that as our girl has grown up ... have you thought about her marriage. Have you seen any boy for her? But your flight is up to club, hotel and cinema. lt isn't your mistake. lt's mistake of my parents. Who have married me to an ascetic. l don't know who is more unfortunate amongst us. l've tried all my life so that you will understand me. And you've always been obstinate that l should adopt your ways. You are absolutely right. How mismatched is this relation. Nothing more. lt's only the result of my sin that l have to live with. Why are you crying, dear? When did you come back? What's the matter, my baby? What's it? Tell me. He has betrayed me, mommy. Who has betrayed? - Ramesh. So you had gone to Kodaikanal to meet him. Have you started lying to your mother too. lt was necessary to lie. - Why was it so necessary? The first time we went with him - he made many promises to me. After coming back here he was gradually keeping away from me. When l couldn't see him for several days, l went after him to Kodaikanal. But what happened there? Tell me. When l reached his bungalow - he wasn't there. After waiting till evening, when he returned, he was with Sarita. And he insulted me in Sarita's presence. Oh, that's the reason. Let him come back, l'll set him right. No mommy. Now l don't want to keep any relation with him. l don't want to see his face. Then why do you cry? l'll find for you a thousand times better boy than Ramesh. No ma. Now l'm not worthy enough to marry anybody. What are you saying, Chitra? l trusted Ramesh and l let him dishonor me before marriage. What? - l made a mistake, ma ... ! Tell me clearly ... ! l'm going to be a mother, ma ... ! What have you done ... ? l didn't show you the light of modern times for this. Not for destroying yourself. l had encouraged you to befriend Ramesh so that you can get a good husband. Now what face shall l show to the society? l had respect in my social circle. They used to give me a place of honor. Now they will runaway even from my shadow ... ! You put me on the path of freedom. But l went too far. Forgive me, ma ... ! Your sin is unforgivable. Mommy. l'm a part of your body. Your blood runs in my veins. All thoughts in my mind have been imbibed by you. All my good and bad learning is your contribution. You showed me the tree of sin. l made the mistake of eating its fruit. Now you too are pushing me away. No. l don't want to hear anything else. Everything has gone wrong. How can l set it right ... ? After a long time you've brought your sacred feet in my room. Do you want to say anything? l've to say a lot but l don't know where to start. You can start anywhere and finish anywhere you like. Suddenly, why are you so confused. Your daughter Chitra has come back. Really? l'm pleased to know it. But just now you had said that Chitra is your daughter. How did she become my daughter so suddenly? Don't curse me like this. Listen to me. Somehow Chitra must be married to Judge Kailash Nath's son Ramesh. As soon as possible. Somehow ! As soon as possible !! What do you mean? For arranging the marriage - we should first talk to them. And we need their acceptance too. l know that. But we don't have that much time. Tell me clearly what's the matter? Ramesh had promised Chitra to marry her. So l had allowed Chitra to meet Ramesh. But how could l know that its consequence ... What is the consequence? l can't say it ... ! My lips don't move ... ! - You mean ... ! No Padma. Don't say that my daughter ... Chitra has done the unimaginable thing. l had always feared this. That's why l used to warn you, Padma. But you never listened. The clouds of new values and freedom which were surrounding this home ... finally they've drowned us. But the sad part is that my innocent daughter had to pay its price. And you and your social circle are responsible for this. Why are your crying now? Now call your society and ask them ... whether or not they have any place for an unmarried mother. lt was my mistake ... ! But you save my daughter somehow. Go to Kailash Nath and beg him to accept my daughter for Ramesh. Go. As soon as possible. Please go. How can l say to a decent man to accept my daughter in his family ... because she is going to mother your son's child? When a father offers his daughter in marriage he narrates her good qualities Forgetting whatever has happened - somehow we have to help solve Chitra's problem. Yes, after all Chitra is my sister. lf l don't go who else will go? l'm going right now ... and l shall demand justice for Chitra. ls Ramesh in the house? - He is out. Please sit, he'll be back. Who are you? You are? - l am Ramesh. l am Jyoti, Chitra's brother. Stop. You're running as if l have come to beg on your door. l have come to order you. l'm in the habit of giving orders - l don't take orders. You're forgetting that my home has been robbed and you're that robber! What do you want? - Restoration of my sister's love. How much do you want? - Nothing, except ... to pay the price come tomorrow at 1 1 :00 AM in Registrar's office. Marriage Registrar's office? What for? For marrying Chitra. Why will l marry Chitra? Are there no other girls in the world. You'll have many girls but you're the only boy for my sister. How can you say that. Ask your sister! How many boys she's involved with? Rascal ! How dare you say that? What is this disturbance? Who are you? Why did you raise your hand on my boy? l seek your forgiveness, Judge. But when justice is denied one has to raise hand to grab it. Justice? For what? What is your name? My name is Jyoti. l am Chitra's brother. Chitra? Prof. Kumar's daughter? - Yes. What has brought a professor's and a judge's son to scuffles? Judge if you were in your court at this time l'd have expected justice from you My son. lt isn't the inanimate chair that does the justice. Justice is done by the person who occupies that chair. Don't listen to him. He is trying to blackmail me by his lies. Be quiet. - You continue, Jyoti. Your son Ramesh became friendly with my sister Chitra for some days. He made false promise of love to her. He promised to marry her. Then he took another girl Sarita to Kodaikanal for having fun. Chitra went to Kodaikanal to look for him. But except disgrace and insult - she couldn't get anything from him. Your son Ramesh has betrayed my sister, Chitra. ls that all? No Judge. There is more to it. What is it, son? Tell me clearly. l feel awkward to say it. How to tell you, judge. My sister lost her innocence. This - your son has disgraced my sister, judge. Jyoti, my son. Whatever you're saying, is it really true? What have you asked, judge ... ? Can a brother say such a thing about his sister? Can he? You are a judge. Do the justice. Ask Ramesh to marry Chitra. Save a family from being disgraced. Judge. My father isn't rich. But his honor is invaluable. His name should not be sullied. For God's sake, judge ... ! Jyoti. You don't worry at all. Full justice will be done to Chitra. Ask your father to kindly wait for me tomorrow morning. Thank you very much. Ramesh! Forgive me for whatever l did. My eyes are fortunate to see you after a long time. l know, my son. But ... ! But. What brought you here? Rekha told me everything, so - l came to meet the judge. Did you meet the judge? What did he say? He will be coming to our home tomorrow. He has asked you to wait. So l need not go to him. May you live long, son. You saved me from humiliation. What would have l told him? How could have l told him? Judge is a very decent person and he said he'll do full justice. You don't worry. - Thank you, son. Now l feel that l do have a son! Come home, son. l will come tomorrow to hear the good news. lf you say it's a false accusation - then l'll be proud that you're my son. But if you decently accept the blame - l shall be very proud of you. l made the mistake. You can repent for your mistake. Are you ready for that? - l'll obey your order. My order? Ordering you is like l'm forcing you to do something against your will. lf you wish to wash your sin then ask order from your conscience. You've put an spot on an innocent girl's honor ... Are you ready to clean it with your tears? You're a son of a judge. lf the blood of justice flows in your veins - then your mind ... your heart will curse you, son! Forgive me. l promise you. l'll marry Chitra. Good, my son ! Well done ! Man makes mistakes, but remorse makes him a true human being, son! Come out, Ramesh. Come on. ls professor Kumar in home? Yes. But you can't meet him at this time. He is my son, Ramesh, and l am Judge Kailash Nath. l have very important work with the Professor. Oh. Please come. Please sit. l'll call him. Sit down, Ramesh. Namastte, Kailash Nath. - Namastte, Professor. l'm very sorry for the misdeed of my son. So much so that l'm embarrassed to seek your forgiveness. But you're a great learned man. l hope you'll forgive me. Whether it is your or my daughter. they are same for all. But as a father l can assure you that my son is really remorseful. He'll accept Chitra. So l have even brought everything for engagement. This is what l had expected from a great person like you. But Chitra was so disappointed ... l've tried my best. Now Chitra's life is in God's hands. Why? What's the matter? Where is my daughter-in-law? What has happened to Chitra? Due to fear of disgrace Chitra has poisoned herself! What have you done, my child. That day when you had come to my house, why didn't you tell me everything? Look, dear. Ramesh has come to marry you. Your Ramesh. Bahu. He's your Ramesh. This Ramesh isn't the same who had betrayed you. He is a new Ramesh. He is your Ramesh. Don't leave me alone. Probably there isn't much time. With your permission ... Ramesh will put sindoor (vermilion) on Chitra to symbolize the marriage. Ramesh! Perform your duty. You're my wife now. No one can take your place now. l promise you. No one will take your place. You've gone to sleep, my child! Sleeping for ever ! Look judge. A married woman is lying on her marital bed. A momentary meeting - and then separation ... How can l console you? But Chitra is my daughter-in-law. l request that for her last rites - she may be named as Mrs. Chitra Ramesh. Chitra's marriage ... Yes son. lt's time to carry her in Doli. Go in. l was very sorry to learn. l can only pray to God to give peace to Chitra's soul. My thoughts go with you during this time of grief. You are my own. Who else can share my grief? Let's start the studies. - No please remain seated. l came to express my condolence. l'll come again tomorrow. Please have rest. Rest. l never had rest in life. And l shall never have rest. Break the door, Jyoti. What have you done, Padma ! None of us could help mother in her that condition. Some or other misfortune has befallen on this home. Maybe it was God's will to give pain to a nice person like you. No Jyoti. God never makes mistake. He knows whom and how to punish for his sin. Calm down, father. You have not eaten anything. Please eat something. l don't need to, Rekha. A stone can survive without food. l wonder how l'm alive even after so many tragic events. l should have died the day l ... - They day you ... what? What are you saying, papa? Do you know why l'm alive so far? Because l've not been punished enough for my sins yet. l have to be punished more. Sin? You haven't sinned, papa! l have ... ! - Why do you say that? Lack of food and sleep affects the mind. At least try to sleep. No Rekha. Sleep is my enemy. When l sleep - frightening nightmares bother me. Very frightening dreams. Dreams ! Dreams are nothing but dreams. They never go with the dreamers. ''Dreams are nothing but dreams. They never go with the dreamers.'' ''Open your eyes and they break away.'' He is my father ... ! How is it possible? How can that scoundrel who betrayed my mother ... and this saintly person who enlightens the world with knowledge... how can this one person have the two different faces? One so pure - and other so dirty ! But why does my mother show reverence for such a man? The man who accepted her religiously and betrayed her so un-religiously. Professor's face is different from his heart. My father is already dead for me. Why should l keep any relation with this professor? lt's my misfortune that l accepted such a person as my guide - who is misguided. Rather than guiding he can put me on wrong path. l will never let even his shadow to fall on me now. Professor Kumar. Yes Principal ... ! What's the matter? What? Prakash has resigned But why? Don't you know the reason? Okay. l will go to him. l'll go right now. What's this stupidity.? You think l'll let you resign ! Let's go in and talk. l've been told that you have resigned ! Why? - l don't like this job. Didn't like it? You're a promising lecturer. You can progress to the position of the principal ... Whose picture is this? How are you concerned? Why are you answering so rudely? Tell me whose picture is this? lf you must know, then listen. This is my mother's picture. Your mother ! lsn't her name is Parvati? She could have any name - how are you concerned? How am l concerned? Prakash ... First say it - she is Parvati ! Yes, she is my mother. That means - l'm your father, and you're my son ! Neither l am your son - nor l have any father. You don't know but - l am your father. No ... ! Alright. Call your mother, son Look Professor. Don't annoy me by repeatedly calling me as your son. l've learnt from you for some days. But for that l would not have allowed even your shadow on my door. l've understood, son - but just call your mother once. Never ! - But why not? She isn't a stranger - l want to meet my wife. Parvati is my wife. She isn't - maybe she was someday! Now she is only my mother. After 27 years have you come to find amber under the ashes? My mother has spent her youth crying without you. She doesn't need you now. Her son can care for her. But Prakash, you're my son too. Forget the old things, let me meet your mother just once. lt is impossible. l'll never do that. Go away from here. Know that l'm your father - you're sending me away from your home! Yes, sir ! lf a husband can throw out his wife, why can't a son do that. Professor. Each man has to bear the punishment for his misdeeds. ln this life and in this world. Give me an opportunity to explain. - l understand everything. lf you've regard for your honor - just leave this place right now. lt is his voice. He is here. Who has closed the door. Open the door, son. You go away from here ... - You give me a chance ... Open the door. Why have you locked me. Forget this doorstep. Prakash ... Open the door. Where is he. My god. My husband. He is gone, ma ! - No, he was here ! How did you treat him. - Same way as he had treated you. What? You sent him away ! You washed away the prayers of my whole life ! Murderer. What did you do! For 27 years l drank the poison of separation. Today when the nectar of union came - you broke that cup. You've taken so much poison in life - even nectar would have tasted bitter. lt is good that he is gone. Until today l'd never felt the deficiency of my eyes. But today l'm crying because of my blindness. Only if l had my eyes ! l could have searched him. But where can l go now - who will show me the way? How can l find him. Sir ! You're home. His blood pressure is very high. His life could be in danger. He needs complete rest. l am very unlucky. l couldn't even touch his feet. Have patience, dear. God will answer your prayer some day. Good it happened. Whatever happened was good. l got the punishment for my misdeed. l deserved it, Jyoti. What are you saying? Why are you talking like this? Say what is on your mind clearly. Yes. Today l want to tell you everything. There is a book in my drawer. Gandhi's ''My Experiments with Truth.'' Bring that. - Yes. You won't be able to sit. Lie down. No matter how much one tries to hide his mistakes - his crimes ... He can't hide them. Someday his misdeeds confront him. You look very upset today - l've never seen you so upset before. Whose picture is this, father? My wife Parvati. Prakash's mother. - Prakash? Prakash is your brother Jyoti! - Brother ! How could it be, father? This is the story of my mistake ! A mistake which had subdued the voice of my conscience. Thirty years ago ... l was married to Parvati. Sometime after the marriage - l came to know that Parvati's eyesight was deteriorating. l took her to a doctor. l came to know that this doctor had treated her eyes before. He had also told Parvati's parents that her problem was chronic and incurable. She will completely lose her sight in a few days. l was shocked to hear this. Parvati's parents had knowingly thrust upon me a blind girl. At that time Parvati was pregnant. Yet l left Parvati in her mother's home forever. ln any case she is your wife now. Only six months ago before the sacred fire you had accepted her as your wife. And now you want to leave her here forever ! You should be ashamed of saying this. Rather you should be ashamed for marrying a blind girl through lies. You didn't realize how impossible it is for a promising scholar to ... bear the burden of a blind wife. Not only me you cheated my parents too. l've made a decision - l've no concern with your daughter. Think a little, son. She is going to be a mother of your child. Yes, she's going to bear your child. Who knows that child can be blind too. You keep her in your home - l've nothing to do with you people. That wasn't right on my part ... ! When l realized my mistake - l searched Parvati everywhere. But l couldn't find her anywhere. After 27 years when l had a chance to meet Parvati - Prakash did not let me see her. l've only one desire in my heart. To seek forgiveness from Parvati - and to hug Prakash as my son. But perhaps this desire will not be fulfilled. l am about to die. Don't be disheartened. Have courage. Rekha. You take care of papa. l'm going to see Parvati, ma. Rekha. l may not get time. l want to tell you another secret. Before dying your father had given me Rs.150,000 to take care of you l bought this house with that money. This house belongs to you. - My house? l've deposited rent every month in your account in the bank. Are you hearing, Rekha. Papa! You've been paying rent for your daughter's house ! l'm the trustee of this house. This house is your trust and does a father ever takes daughter's money? Brother ! - Who are you? l am your brother. - l have no brother. We may not be from the same branch but we're flowers of the same garden. Our gardener is the same. l think you have come to the wrong address. Wrong address? - Yes. No, l've come to the right address. l'm Jyoti, Professor Kumar's son. l've come to you and ma ... ! - Why are you going in? My mother can't meet anybody. She is sick. ls ma sick? Then it is necessary for her son to see her. Parchoo ... ! Look, who has come? May you live long. Parchoo, who else is calling me as ma ! You don't know me ma ! l am also your son. My son? - Yes ma. l am also Professor Kumar's son. What? What is your name, son? My name is Jyoti, ma. - Jyoti, where is your father? He had come here. But ... ! How do l explain? l know everything ma. l've come to take you and my brother to him. Father needs you. Today your father needs ma. There was a time when ma needed him. Where had he gone at that time? When husband couldn't support his blind wife, why should wife support him now. l know why you hate father so much? But l don't blame you. When l man regrets his crime and is ready to clean with his tears ... at that time unforgiving people also become criminals. Parchoo. Don't be obstinate. Now that your father has called me, let me go to him once. You too come with me, son. No ma. l won't go there. Brother. lf father leaves this world, won't you feel sorry. What? What has happened to him. - Ma! Father is nearing the death. Brother insulted him and threw him out of this home ... and he could not seek your forgiveness, all this has shocked him too much. Perhaps he's living only to meet you and brother to seek forgiveness for his crimes before leaving this world. lf you want to clear the debt of my milk - this is the only time for you. Listen. lf you stop me from going, l'll assume l never had a son. For a Hindu woman her husband comes before his son. Let's go mo. l'm coming with you too. What are you doing, papa? You lie down. l think Jyoti won't be able to persuade them so l should go. No papa. l won't let you go anywhere in this condition. Take this medicine. - That's alright, but ... Papa, look who have come ! Parvati and Prakash ! You've forgiven me !! Papa, please sit down. - No Rekha, don't stop me. Parvati has come to my home - let me welcome her. l've met my god. - Parvati. Parvati, you don't know how l've spent my life without you. l searched for you everywhere. l know everything. Jyoti has told me everything. Parchoo ... - Yes ma. Don't you want to touch your father's feet and seek his blessings. Perhaps, Prakash is still angry with me. Father ... ! - You may live long, my son ! Taking out my childhood prejudice from my heart took long time. Forgive me. - You've forgiven me, my son. But you will have to do me a favor. - Please command me. You'll have to marry my friend's daughter. Brother, you seem to be perplexed. Daughter of father's friend is no other than our Rekha. Come Rekha. Move forward. Hands that hold this Rekha (line) - the world will be jealous about his luck. Take this Parvati and give Rekha's hand to Prakash with your own hands. Come here, my child. - Ma ! Parchoo ... ! God may give you long life, children. What is all this? You brought us here but you are leaving ! Now l won't let you go anywhere. Papa. Look, Jyoti is going again. What is the matter, Jyoti. Once again you're leaving me! l've come back here forever, papa. - l thought perhaps ... l too will find little place under your sacred feet. Now l'll not let you go anywhere, son.
