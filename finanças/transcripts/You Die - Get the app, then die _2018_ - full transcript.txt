Can you promise me you'll calm down? No, I'll calm down when they get this thing away from me. - No, I'll calm down when they get this thing away from me. - Okay. Okay. Let me put on a shirt and we'll head out. Do you mind? It seems like it's an application like all the rest of them, but it's weird, I can't take it off at all. It's like it's a part of the phone now. So you can't delete it? It looks like I can't. How is it even possible? How is there not any information on the internet? How is there not any information on the internet? In fact, I haven't found anything on the internet, but- - In fact, I haven't found anything on the internet, but... But? But I found something when I went deeper... - Deeper, like what? - The deep web? Deeper. Deeper. In the dark web. In the dark web. I've been there in the past, but usually just for some shady deal. Here you can hack computers. There's money laundering, drug trafficking, weapons. Nothing I've ever done, Nothing I've ever done, not for me, at least... not for me, at least... Okay, are they talking about You Die in the dark web? - Okay, are they talking about You Die in the dark web? - Okay, I found something... Okay, I found something... There's links to some police reports where some people freaked out about seeing the dead about seeing the dead through a phone app. Through a phone app. And? And they're dead. Look here. Maybe it's a coincidence but they all seem really similar to each other. But they all seem really similar to each other. How did they die? How did they die? It says, "cardiac arrest." - It says, "cardiac arrest." - So this app can kill you. So this app can kill you. - So this app can kill you. - No, I didn't say that. No, I didn't say that. No, I didn't say that. In these reports they're talking about the disturbed. In these reports they're talking about the disturbed. Paranoid people, sociopaths... But the weird thing is that everyone claimed to have been tortured by the dead claimed to have been tortured by the dead that they reached through the app. That they reached through the app. That they reached through the app. Please, man, Please, man, what the fuck are we talking about? Leo, shut up for a minute, please! Asia, I think we've heard enough already. Don't you realize it's all bullshit? Don't you realize it's all bullshit? I thought so, too, I thought so, too, but I was fascinated when I read about all these similarities. All of them said there was a wound on the body that showed a link. - A link? - A link. Yes. - A link? - A link. Yes. But only they saw it. But only they saw it. It's like if the app takes over your mind, It's like if the app takes over your mind, it actually exists. It actually exists. It actually exists. But it's a game, a sadistic game. But it's a game, a sadistic game. But it's a game, a sadistic game. And now I have it on my phone. And now I have it on my phone. - And now I have it on my phone. - Maybe someone else downloaded it. Maybe someone else downloaded it. Here it says you have to download it to someone within 24 hours. It says 5 hours right here. It says 5 hours right here. Are you telling me the time is going to run out? Are you telling me the time is going to run out? I don't know! I haven't found anything else. I think this app actually exists and was created like a game and was spread on the internet. I think it has an effect on the minds of certain people, triggering paranoia, anxiety, pushing them into isolation, making them more sociopathic, more paranoid, and more dangerous to themselves and others. And more dangerous to themselves and others. Basically you become addicted. Basically you become addicted and it will take you to death. And it will take you to death. I think it was removed from the internet for this reason, I think it was removed from the internet for this reason, so nobody can download it anymore. So it's all a psychological thing? - I don't know. - I don't know what to think. It could be subliminal messages that push you so far over the edge that you'll do anything. Okay, so if there is no trace of You Die anywhere, not even in the deep web, how can I learn more? Is there anyone I can talk to? There's a name, some guy that was paranoid like everyone else. He made some sort of blog. He made some sort of blog. Myke Butler. Myke Butler. But who knows if he's still alive. Asia, please don't tell me you believe this. Leo, you don't have to be here if you don't believe it. Find this guy. I want to talk to him. Find this guy. I want to talk to him. Hurry! Hurry! - Here it is. - I think this is it. - Here it is. I think this is it. - Are you sure? Are you sure? It has the You Die app as the profile picture. - It has the You Die app as the profile picture. - Well, call him. Well, call him. Come on! Hey. Myke? Hey? That's me. Listen... I know why you called. I know what you wanna ask me. They all call. They all wanna know. "All"? They all wanna know how I survived. How I made it. You got the link. Yeah. You? I know you can see it. What is he talking about? Do you see the wound, Asia? I don't understand. Is this... real? - Is this... real? - Real? Real? It's more than that. It's more than that. It's alive. It's alive. And it won't stop. I pass this thing to people I pass this thing to people every day. Every day. And that's what you gotta do if you don't wanna die. And that's what you gotta do if you don't wanna die. And if you pass it to someone, And if you pass it to someone, you survive? You survive? No. You get 24 hours. Every time you pass this thing to someone else, Every time you pass this thing to someone else, the timer goes back to 24h. The timer goes back to 24h. And you have one more day to pass it again. So... I have to pass it every single day? Yes. It's the only way. Yes. It's the only way. This is real. This is real. It's a door to another dimension, It's a door to another dimension, where death lives. Where death lives. The dead... They can see you. And they will kill you if you don't pass it to someone else. Someone said a medium had it created or something. I don't know. They were, like, she wanted her clients to see the people they wanted to talk to. See the people they wanted to talk to. It's crazy. It's crazy. It doesn't matter what you believe. It doesn't matter what you believe. But you're gonna die. That's for sure. But you're gonna die. That's for sure. But you're gonna die. That's for sure. So you might as well get used to it. So you might as well get used to it. No, I'd never... Oh, you'll do it! Believe me! 'Cause you don't wanna die. Just like me. Just like me. Look, I used to care about other people. Look, I used to care about other people. Look, I used to care about other people. But this thing makes you hate everybody, But this thing makes you hate everybody, even makes you hate yourself. Even makes you hate yourself. You chose to be a monster. You chose to be a monster. Well, I'm a monster. And if you ain't gonna be a monster, you're gonna be dead. You're gonna be dead. You know what? You know what? You're wasting my time. I got 2 hours before I have to kill somebody. I got 2 hours before I have to kill somebody. No, no! Wait, wait! Please! No, no! Wait, wait! Please! Whatever you do, Whatever you do, good luck, just follow the rules. Good luck, just follow the rules. What rules? Shit, I shouldn't even said that, 'cause one of the rules is not to tell anybody 'cause one of the rules is not to tell anybody how this fucking thing works. 'Cause one of the rules is not to tell anybody. So you don't even give them a chance to survive? So you don't even give them a chance to survive? - So you don't even give them a chance to survive? - No. That's why they erased every trace of You Die. No. That's why they erased every trace of You Die from the internet. If they all know how this thing works, they'll spread it and we all die. I'm just being generous. I'm just being generous. Rule number two: Rule number two: Don't break your phone, don't break your phone, Okay? 'Cause if you break your phone the timer goes to 1 minute and you die. The timer goes to 1 minute and you die. Don't cheat, or else the app will kill you immediately. Don't cheat, or else the app will kill you immediately. Don't leave your phone nowhere, and don't buy no stupid new phones. And don't buy no stupid new phones. This thing is not on your phone, it is on you. This thing is not on your phone, it is on you. And it will follow you until you are dead. I don't want to pass it to anyone. - I don't want to pass it to anyone. - Believe me, Believe me, you will 'cause they're coming. They're coming. They're coming. You can see them... Look, your time is running out. The clock is ticking. Shit!

No, Claudia, you have to help me. Please, please you have to help me. I'm seeing things. I'm not making any of this up. I swear. There's no information on it, you know? It's like they erased every trace of it so you can't find anything. - Asia, sit down. - No, no! I don't know what to do. Please! What do I have to do? If I tell Filippo, he'll never believe me. - No one will believe me. - Asia. Leo doesn't even believe me, I went... Asia! Sit. Sit down. Now, listen to me. We're not gonna say anything to Filippo. Don't tell anyone else. Leo doesn't believe you. You can't blame him. What about you? - What about you? - Do you believe me? Do you believe me? Yes. I believe you. What do I have to do? You've always been a bit delicate, naive. I know you're afraid. But what are you afraid of the most? But what are you afraid of the most? Is it dying? Is it dying? Is it ruining someone else's life? Is it ruining someone else's life? I don't understand. I don't understand. I believe so. I believe you can't handle this pressure. You're too weak. What are you saying? - What are you saying? - I'm saying you don't have to be a pain in the ass, Asia. I'm saying you don't have to be a pain in the ass, Asia. Wait, what? You're crying. You're so desperate. You're a nobody. Claudia, what happened? You know what, Asia? You were right. It's real. I'm sure you know all the rules at this point, right? So it's real? It depends on the point of view. There are freaks out there. There are freaks out there who believe this app is actually a portal to the underworld. Who believe this app is actually a portal to the underworld. I don't care with the truth is. I've accepted this thing and I live with it day after day I've accepted this thing and I live with it day after day without crying, without crying, without being a fucking pain in the ass to people. My brother? Did you download it to him? Filippo? Who do you think I am? I would never hurt a person that I love. I would never hurt a person that I love. This is what you call being strong. This is what you call being strong. So, you download it to a stranger every day, So, you download it to a stranger every day, every 24 hours? So, you download it to a stranger every day, Yes. You'll think I'm a monster. No. No, I'm playing it. No, I'm playing it and I'm surviving. And I'm surviving. How in the hell are you doing this to people? You have no choice! Otherwise you die, Aisa. Think about it. I could never do it. I could never do it. I would not download it to anyone. I would not download it to anyone. When will you fucking learn to be strong? I will find another solution. Asia... You really are fooled. Just download it to someone and don't say anything. If you think about telling any of this to Filippo, I will convince you're insane. Depressed, paranoid, psychotic. Self-harm. It's more than enough to get you locked up in a clinic. It's more than enough to get you locked up in a clinic where you will die. Where you will die. The only positive thing is that you'll stay there for a short time, for less than 24 hours. I can't believe you're saying this. It doesn't matter. Now go home, go and get changed. We'll see you at dinner? I don't think I'm coming. Alright. I'll have to make up something for Filippo. Do what I told you. Excuse me, I have to get ready. Can you go any fucking faster? It's a '94, and if I get out and push, we'll get there faster. Don't you think you should change it? For all the work you do, you should have millions. I definitely don't make apps that kill people. I don't know if this whole situation is real, but I'm a little sorry for Asia. But I'm a little sorry for Asia. She's your girl, right? She's your girl, right? - She's your girl, right? - She's not my girl. She's not my girl. You should ask her. - You should ask her. - What? What? If she wants to be your girlfriend. Oh, you're an asshole. You were an asshole to her. She just wanted you to believe her. She just wanted you to believe her. It doesn't matter what you believe. It doesn't matter what you believe. It matters what she believes, and she believes it's real. You understand how she feels right now? Shit!

But a fuck wouldn't kill us, right? No. No, sure. My wife however... Your wife? Marisa. I think Marisa would kill me if she knew I was with a girl. So you're married? Ah, yeah. Is it a problem? - Ah, yeah. Is it a problem? - No, absolutely not. No, absolutely not. I thought you hook... Excuse me. You ladies. I thought you ladies do it often with married men. Yes.

To visit her mother, so it's okay. You have kids? You have kids? Yes. Two. Two sons. Look. Two sons. Look. Here they are. Here they are. Aren't they handsome? I hate that Asia couldn't come. Is everything alright? I'm worried about Asia. Me too, always. But it's only been a few months since the accident. Let's give it some time. No, I'm not talking about your parents. She came by the house twice today. She was talking about this app on her phone that's torturing her. I don't understand. I promised her I wouldn't tell you anything, Fili, but I'm too worried she could get into trouble. But I'm too worried she could get into trouble. No, Claudia, I'm not following you.
