Why are you pale when looking at me? Swear to my sun, I haven't seen a woman like that one. Give me that chalk, what are you staring at? Like painted. Real city-girl. I swear to God Trifun, if you continue like this, we'll have to marry you once more time. Leave him alone. He is a family man. Settled. Have a child. God forbid, and a wife. My darling is swine herding, swine herding and for me longing. Like you can't take a joke Trisha, for the God's sun sake.

Look around and don't forget something. There are no breaks for me now. I am preparing an exhibition. Did you take all brushes? I did, I did. And don't rush like a steer. You peasants are interesting, but not for a long. One gives you a finger, and you want a whole hand. Pay attention, don't forget a brush sweeping cloth. It is here, here. Tonight I also have meeting of party secretariat. Preparation for the October celebration. Eh my Trisha, It is not my fault that you are swineherd, like that bigot father of yours. For God's name. .. his mother. What has happened, for the moist sun sake. E, I am a catfish, ... to my dull head. Even with this big plain truth, I landed to this tree. Bad lucker, sacramental bad lucker. If you yawed a bit, you would end up on plain. Not a single hair would fall from your head. What are you gazing at. You'd better help me to get out of here. I can only go to the village to take a ladder. Trisha, climb that three and help the comrade. All right, all right, just stay there. I'll do it myself. ... your mother Go, what are you waiting for. Go. Wait. Come on now. Hop. Eh, bad luck, it must always happen to me. This is the third time. The first time I ran to the power line tower. The second time, church steeple. And now, here, this tree. At the end, I'll break my neck in some pigpen. But this time I didn't pick up so bad place after all. Let me introduce myself comrade. Mile Simic. Milanche. Agricultural aviation pilot. I am driving this spraying cans. Some call them coffins. In every bad thing there is some good. Imagine that I crashed on an old age home. A? Trisha, give something more to eat. Comrade pilot must be hungry after all he went through. I am keeping him as a service. He is dumb, but he is loyal. There are five of us, And covering the whole Srem. I am flying from day to day. Oh, that must be wonderful. Always above the earth. Oh. Earth is, please excuse me, like a huge ass. There is nothing on it. Most often it stinks. I see that you are an artist. Lady. Well, I am entertaining myself in this wasteland. You should, you should... Where were you until now? What is it Trisha? Bring something to drink. The bottle is empty. I must say everything twice. And what are you going to do now? Mechanics will repair that trash and I'll fly again. But don't you worry. The next time I am crashing on the same tree. I know your kind. And after? What is left? The maiden tears. It is not like that. On the other hand, when you think about it, what is this life comrade? You got out from a hole, swirl round the hole all the time, eventually into the hole... ... your mother. Why are you not paying attention comrade? Oh, I am sorry. Trisha, why are you not paying attention to what you are doing? You could my friend take a little walk? A? It is clear air outside. Wonderful. You can trust, trust a bitch, but do not trust a flirt. Trustiness of flirt, Trustiness of a bitch. I don't need you Trisha till Sunday. On Sunday, as usual, We are going out to paint. Come one comrade. Beat it. Like you don't know where the door is.

Let it be, let it be I am not playing well, But somehow I always mop up in Rummy. Is it? But, I am playing honestly. Touched, moved. Eh, that was not a deal. One can touch, without moving. What and who I was touching in my life. One thing is touching, But another is to commit yourself. You can trust, trust a dog, but do not trust a wooer. You can trust, trust a dog, but do not trust a wooer. Trustiness of wooer, trustiness of a dog. Trustiness of wooer, trustiness of a dog You bastard. You raff. You mob.

Let it be, it wouldn't be a loss. Comrades. Thanks to our pilots our fields will be blooming. And today, when we live in the time of progress. When even the heart in our chest does not have to be our own. Very clever chick. Everywhere, even into the villages, new ideas should be pressed forward. More modern. Because, there is no economy without the culture. Nor the culture without economy. These are two faces of the same thing. And when comrade Milan crashed, I meant, landed, That is why comrades, Our pilot Mile, should fly on the sky for a long, long time. And we are going to wish him farewell now. That's right. Long live. Come on Mile. Glory, glory, glory for the Serb. Eagle is crying from the height, voice can be heard from the deep, Don't you worry a grey bird, we all stand by you Svetozar Miletic (19th century political leader) Glory, glory, glory for the Serb. We had been slaves enough, But we are free now, don't you worry a grey bird, we all stand by you Svetozar Miletic ... just call us and we we'll be there Glory, glory, glory for the Serb. Svetozar the son of Serb, we are all proud of you, don't you worry a grey bird, we all stand by you Svetozar Miletic ... just call us and we'll be there. We came to this plain to be seen by everybody and to remind them that we exists. My opinion comrades is that we should not Move from here until we get an airplane. All villages around has one plane each, but we, as orphans... What plane? We won't move from here until things gets better. That is it! That's exactly it. When students can do it, we can as well. To bring in the law once for all. Everybody to be equal. Fuck it. Excuse me comrade president. You are welcome. Worker should get what he is entitled to. Look at us. There is nothing a dog can bite to. We had enough of bourgeois, even they were the red ones. Let's comrades, send a telegram to those who are up. To whom up? To a pilot? What a pilot? You fool. Wind, the wind is blowing, plums are falling. Miserable poor always goes under. Miserable poor always goes under. My opinion comrade is this. We who are down, we are sending telegram to those who are up. A, what is it? What? According to early morning broadcasts of the Czechoslovakian free radio Across the whole country was noticed a movement of a new occupation forces and removing the old ones. A raising number of the occupation forces are entering the country, And a number of foreign soldiers are Moving from east to the west, towards Prague particularly. Free radio is estimating that there are nearly half of a million of foreign soldiers in Czechoslovakia. Gunshots from automatic rifles could be heard last night in Prague. It is reported that the occupation forces were shooting at every vehicle that was moving in through the city, even to the public safety vehicles, as well as to the vehicles that were picking up earlier wounded persons. What are you people doing here, in this wasteland? Looking for something? Did you see the news comrade? We are not really getting press around here. I don't know. Doomsday is near. Let it be, it wouldn't be a loss. Let it be, it wouldn't be a loss. What are they doing there? What do they want? I don't know. Some Czechs. Collecting donations. What donation. For what?
