My dad's a collector. Used to be his business. [Bubby] Princess Pink. [Angel Sighs] This is gonna be fun. [Knocking] How do you like your dinner, Mr. Pop? Pizza be better than this. [Clears Throat] Our daughter has a healthy appetite, don't you think? Mother, don't start. Be quiet. Let your mother speak uninterrupted. Thank you, dear. We tried to bring her up as best we could, but she's been rather a disappointment to us. [Silverware Clatters] Be the first time you didn't finish your dinner. I find fat people so‒ so gross. So unfortunate, of course, but so… ugly. [Angel Sobbing] What do you think, Mr. Pop? Me think Angel be beautiful. She's a fat slut. Careful what you say, dear. Better he know that she's a fat slut. If God had wanted us to be fat, he'd have made us all the same way, wouldn't he? But he didn't! God doesn't like fat people! Fat people are an abomination in his eyes! Fuck you, God.

Angel come too? No, Bubby. [Sobbing Continues] My parents were just waiting to die anyway, Bubby. They were both riddled with poisons and cancers. Asbestos from the brake linings, lead from the car exhausts, P.C.B.'s from the car seats, dioxins, "parathidions," dieldrin, mercury, radioactivity. Whoever did it just put them out of their misery. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. That be nice. That be poisoning us. That be poisoning the air that we breathe. If the poison don't get you, then God will. ♪♪ [Chanting In Foreign Language] Beautiful, isn't it? Fantastic. And yet this mob have been trying for centuries… to cling-wrap this mob, even though they share the same God. Mind you, this mob have been getting pretty good at cling-wrapping lately. And this mob's got the same God as well, but they've had a fair go at cling-wrapping that first mob. They've been trying to cling-wrap that second mob for a good couple of thousand years. And they pretty well succeeded in cling-wrapping… just about all this mob, who never did much cling-wrapping… to anyone but themselves. Then there's this lot. A different god altogether. You'd think that would help, but it doesn't. See, this mob cling-wrapped about half a million… of that first mob… 40 or 50 years ago. And they've been at it ever since. They've all done their fair share of killing or being killed, and it's all pointless. The thing, Bubby, is don't be like them. No matter how mad you get at someone, don't kill them‒ ever. Bubby done cling-wrap them. Me Pop now. Talking like that, you'll be running the country soon enough. No more excuses. No more cling-wrapping. Okay? Bubby? - Okay. - [Whispers] Good. And, uh, don't mention it to anyone. We look like all being rich and famous soon enough, so let's not spoil it. Okay. [Chattering] Yes, mate. How much that be? That be five dollar. Where be Pop? Where be Pop? When be them come on stage? Them be here soon. Them be here real soon. [Chanting] Where be Pop? Where be Pop? Where be Pop? Where be Pop? Where be Pop? Where be Pop?
