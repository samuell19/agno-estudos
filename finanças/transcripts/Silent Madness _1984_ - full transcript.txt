- Oh, Romano. You know you're not allowed in the ladies' room. - The subway, I gotta find the subway. No, no, Romano, you don't want the subway. That's such a dirty place. - Dr. Vandice told me, it's time for me to go. My mother is waiting. - Romano, let's go to the day room and do your exercises, huh? - But Dr. Vandice said that I could go home. - He did? - I gotta find the subway, Dr. Gilmore. That's the way home. - Romano, come with me. Come on. - Dr. Harris. Dr. Harris. Dr. Harris to the OR. Come on. Don't do this to me. - No. - Yes, you do. - No, man. No, no, no, no. - Don't do this, man. - Dr. Vandice, did you sign papers on Romano Hunter? Dr. Vandice. - What? - Did you sign release papers on Romano Hunter? - Who? - Romano Hunter. Over there. - Oh, yes. Dr. Kruger said we were scheduled to release more patients. - How can you and Dr. Kruger keep releasing patients as disabled as Romano? This is the fifth one in the last two weeks! - I believe I know more about these matters than you do, Dr. Gilmore. - I'm sure you do, Doctor. Your wisdom and expertise in these matters is legendary. Dr. Anderson, I don't see how they can justify discharging Romano. The man can't even think- - Oh, Joan, you know how desperately overcrowded and understaffed we are. Kruger's release program has really benefited everyone. With fewer patients, we can give more attention to the really serious cases. Now, this is the release list for the last two weeks. I'm sure you'll agree that none of these people are dangerous to society. - Oh, Doctor, it's just that- - Oh, Joan. In a perfect world, we would keep every patient here until they were cured. In the real world, however, we barely have enough money to take care of them. Kruger's idea is simply to move patients back into society as simply as possible. - Well, I think he's wrong in this case. - Well, if you feel that strongly about Romano, we'll keep him, though I may have to put him back on your caseload. - Of course. - Okay. Consider it done. You take this block. Now, where should this go? Can you find out? - What are these patients doing here? - It's all right, Dr. Kruger. Dr. Anderson agreed to rescind his release. - I'm not talking about Romano. What is this man doing here? - John? John Howard? - Yes, John Howard. - I didn't do anything. I didn't. - Damn it, why didn't you tell me you were gonna hold on to this patient? - But I didn't. He was on the list exactly as we discussed. At least I think he was. - Yes, he was on the list. - Go away. - Oh Christ. You know perfectly well our budget doesn't permit this kind of leeway. Now the system is burdened with two additional patients. - But I know I released five patients. There must be something wrong here. I distinctly remember five patients on the list. - There must be something wrong here. - Romano, get back over there. - John Howard. I'm positive I signed a release for John Howard. I mean, I realize we can't afford to- - It's all right, Roger, no need to go on. I'm sure there were proper and justifiable reasons for retaining them. Dr. Gilmore here made the point that Romano was unprepared for release. Dr. Anderson probably thought it was too soon for John as well. Well, I hope you're right, Doctor. It'd be a shame to prevent this man from rejoining society as a functioning, healthy individual. No, no, no. Okay, come on. I'll take care of the food, okay? Yeah. - Hello, Ruth. May I use the computer for a minute? - Haven't met me. - Trying to show me that you can catch fish, huh? Can't catch fish. - Dr. Kruger knows about this? - You think I'd come here if he didn't? - All right, I'll be in the lounge if you want me. - Okay. Howard, John Howard. Howard Johns? Oh my God. They released the wrong man. - Paul. - What's goin' on? - Who's out there? - Oh my God. Who's out there? - Don't go. - Let go of me. - Please don't go away! Where'd he go? Oh! No, please, don't. Oh my God. - Dr. Daniels. Dr. Daniels. Dr. Daniels to emergency. - What do you want? - I wanted to check on the condition of one of the patients. - Only those with permission from Dr. Kruger work in Ward I. - I'm a doctor, Virgil, remember? - You're not allowed in there. Besides, these people can't be helped. They don't have no minds to examine. They're the living dead, Doc. We got 'em plugged in, juiced up 24 hours a day. Not much for a doctor like you to do. - I think I should be the judge of that. - Even if you wanna work with the dead, you still have to get permission from Dr. Kruger. - But I- - See Kruger, Dr. Gilmore. Bye! Bye! - Okay, listen, I meet you in the luggage room, okay? - Okay. See ya later. - Bye-bye. - Hi, Prof. - Hi, Barbara. Have a good vacation. - Thanks. Bye! No! No! No! - Oh my God. Doc. I told you you're not allowed in here. - A doctor should make that decision, not an attendant. - What's these papers you got here, Doc? - I want you to tell me what's going on in this ward. These conditions are inhuman. - These patients are inhuman. We get all the weird ones, the real crazies. For them, Ward I is the last stop. - They're on Thorasil, Doc. One body to a bag. They live and they're gonna die here. - You can't do that. You can't keep a person permanently locked up like that. They need exercise. - Electricity, Doc. The miracles of modern science. We give 'em two minutes on these babies, better than four hours of jogging. - Yeah, it keeps 'em sharp, and best of all there's no bedsores. - Let me by. - Come on, Doc. Don't be hostile. - How would you like another disciplinary report on file? - You cannot come in here- - I can do exactly what I want. Now, let me by. - We shouldn't be enemies, Doc. Come on, let's have a cup of coffee, get to know one another. - You'll address me as Doctor, and there's nothing we need to know about one another except that I'm staff and you're an attendant. - Why, you wouldn't forget about me, would you? Ch, of course not. Bye. - Dr. Kruger, you remember that patient from yesterday? - Don't you think it'd be a little more professional if we talked privately in my office? - This is important. I've discovered a terrible mistake. - Discovered? What are you talking about? - I'm talking about John Howard. I think the wrong patient was discharged in his place. - Oh really? And what has led you to this startling conclusion? - Here, look at the computer printout. - How did you get hold of this? I never gave you access to these files. - Kruger, you've got a killer on the streets. Instead of letting John Howard free, you've released Howard Johns, a dangerous psychotic. - And how did you get that information? - Oh, I checked Ward I to find Howard Johns' bed empty and this discharge paper. - You were in Ward I? - Someone had to check on this. - How the hell did you get into Ward I? You can't just wander around there without clearance. - Clearance? What clearance? Howard Johns didn't need clearance to get out of Ward I. Oh look, what are you doing to these poor people? Either you release them prematurely or you stuff 'em in a plastic bag. - All right, all right, you've got my attention. - So? What are you gonna do? You can't just let a criminal psychotic like Johns roam the city. Considering his condition, he's going to be a real joy on the streets of Manhattan. - Have you told anybody else? - No, not yet. I wanted you to be the first to hear the good news. I'm on my way to Anderson's office now. - I don't think you need disturb Dr. Anderson right now. I've got a meeting with her myself shortly. I can tackle the problem with her then. - Is that it? - I think so. Look, if Howard Johns has been released, I'm sure we can get him back without too much trouble. Certainly nothing to bother your pretty little head about. All right? You inherit $100. - You're wiping me out. - Boardwalk. - Boardwalk? - 50. Thanks. Listen, if you need a loan, let me know. I need one. - Jane, what is the rush? Your parents aren't expecting you for about three days. It's not as if Brockport will be more interesting. Park Place, here I come. - Oh, I don't believe it. - I know. - She always gets Park Place. - Hey, why don't you guys come with me to Ft. Lauderdale? - I'm sure you'll enjoy yourself. - Who me, with all those guys? - What makes you think the guys are gonna look at this face? - Pam, dear, it's not my fault your parents didn't give you enough money to get away from this place. - Ooh. - Oh, I want some pictures of you before you go. Okay. - Miss Lorraine, center stage, please. Sure. ♪ Da da ba ♪ Ba da da Come on, Lorraine. ♪ Ba da ba Do it! I Ba ba da da - Now, wait a minute, girls. I can't even think... Stop, you stop that! You slut, you. - Mrs. Collins. - You, you whore! - Mrs. Collins! - You stop that! - Listen, stop. It's all right. - You shouldn't be flaunting your nakedness in front of the world. - It's not the whole world. It's just us. It's all right. It's all right. - Mrs. Collins, we were only kidding. - Yes, I'm sorry. I sort of overreacted. You don't fool around with temptation. - A little temptation is good for you. It takes you along way. - Cut it out, Pam, you're not being funny. - You should be getting ready. You're supposed to take a plane. - Yeah, don't you have a seven o'clock flight? - Yeah, I didn't pack yet either. - Um, listen, we're gonna go out to the handball courts. Why don't you come by and say goodbye before you go? - Yeah. - Okay? - And don't let the boogeyman get ya. - I'm warning you two. Leave me alone down there. I don't have time for your stupid jokes. Pam? Cheryl? Come on, guys. You guys there? Pam? Cheryl? Pam? - I've called this meeting because of a serious accident that was brought to my attention by Dr. Gilmore. Because of the similarities in the names of two of our patients, a release order was accidentally signed for a man that the state had declared criminally insane. Now, all this could've been a monstrous problem. - Dr. Anderson, I must apologize for both my staff and indeed myself, but fortunately I have discovered that the problem was merely clerical. Howard Johns, the patient in question, was not released as some people seem to have assumed. - What do you mean? It's really quite simple. You see, Howard Johns was not discharged as the papers indicated. The record should have read deceased. - I don't understand. Then why wasn't John Howard released as you originally intended? - We shoulda noticed the problem ourselves. You can see that while Howard Johns' file reads discharged, John Howard's file mistakenly reads deceased, an obvious switch in the records. - You see, after the Barrington sorority murders, he was found innocent by reason of insanity and was committed to Cresthaven Hospital. He passed away from natural causes September 27th. - Okay, thanks very much. Now, we've really been very lucky that nobody dangerous has been released. But this kind of error is inexcusable. It's unacceptable. - Dr. Anderson, could I ask one question? Mm-hmm. - What was done with Howard Johns' body? - Cremation, you see- - The research division- - Well, Doctors, what did happen in this case? I hardly think the research department would have much use for a body that's been cremated. - Dr. Kruger is more familiar with this case than I am. - Thank you. Now, in cases like these when the patient dies intestate and without family, the standard procedure is to cremate the body. - And is that what happened? - Yes, yes, Virgil saw to it last week. - May I see the death certificate and cremation order? - What? What death certificate? - Think what you're implying is slightly out of line? - It should be available, shouldn't it? - Dr. Gilmore, what business is this of yours? - Oh, please, please, please, will everyone be quiet? Thank you. Joan, I don't have any problem with presenting you with the death certificate. - Now? - Well, are these documents kept in the files? - Certainly. Of course it may take several days to get the information back. You see, when I discovered the error, I sent the papers immediately to the state for correction. - Dr. Kruger, Joan, may I see you both for a moment, please? This was a most unfortunate incident, Dr. Kruger. I feel that you're rushing your program a bit. I want you to ease up. Do your homework more thoroughly. - Now Dr. Anderson, you know our policy about the patients. - Ease up. It's more important that we don't make any mistakes. - Yes. - Joan, you've been with us how long now? - Four months. - That's all? You must have been assigned every weekend since July. How 'bout taking this weekend off? Give you a chance to get some of the pressure from this place off your shoulders. - Sounds like a good idea. - Good. I'll see ya Monday morning. And then in the meantime, all the paperwork on the late Howard Johns will be completed. Okay. - I'm glad you're taking some time off, Dr. Gilmore. It's not good for a psychiatrist to experience too much stress, you know. Two of the patients in Ward I used to be shrinks. Bye. - Excuse me. - Oh, hi. - Hi. Could you direct me to the person in charge, please? - Oh, sure, sure. It's me. I'm Sheriff Liggett. What can I do for ya? - Oh, my name is Joan Gilmore. I'm a psychiatrist at Cresthaven Hospital in Manhattan. Um Would it be possible for me to see police records concerning one of my patients, a Howard Johns? - Why? - Well, as I said, he's a patient of mine and I could use the additional background in my work with him. - The only damn background you need about that son of a bitch is he's nuts. - He's not nuts, Sheriff, he has an illness. - Oh yeah? Well look, Dr. Gilmore. You see this, huh? - Yes. - Well, I wasn't just born with this. Mr. Johns did this to me. Now, why are ya here? - Actually, I suspect that he was mistakenly released from hospital sometime Wednesday. And considering his illness and condition, I wanna find him and get him under some kind of supervision before he gets hurt or can hurt someone else. - Wait a minute, wait a minute, just let's back up a little bit, huh? You suspect he was released? You mean you don't know? - Well, there was a clerical error and he may have been released in place of another patient. Look, can you help me? I'm not sure if it would even be possible for him to come back here, but- - Oh, that worm would crawl his way back here if ya dropped him on the far side of the moon. - Well, regardless, I think it's important we find him. - Okay, Dr. Gilmore, thanks for the tip. Listen, call me tomorrow. I have to check this out before I could give you any information from our files. - If you talk to the hospital, they'll tell you Johns has died. - What? - Well, it is a possibility. - Are you kidding me? I mean, what is this? Is that bastard really dead or are you just making up stories, huh? - It's possible he is dead. - Look, why don't you go over to the newspaper office across the green. They'll give you all the information ya need. - It would be better if I could see official police records. - Check the newspapers. That's your best bet. - Thank you, Sheriff. I appreciate the help. - Don't mention it. Please, don't mention it. Hello, Valerie? Listen, Val, get me Mark McGowan right away and also get me the number of the Cresthaven Mental Hospital in Manhattan. Cresthaven, Cresthaven. Right, I wanna talk to someone in charge about that screwball Howard Johns. Right. Thanks, Val. Hello, Mark? Hello? - Yes. I help you? - I hope so. The sheriff said you might. I'm doing research for a magazine article on Howard Johns. Could I see your microfilm files? - We don't have microfilm files. - It's all right, Anne. - Why do you wanna know about Howard Johns? - Anne, I'll take care of this. - Oh, you have work to do. This is not something you should waste your time on. - Who's wasting time? If you wanna take a look at our back issues, you're welcome to, but you could uh spend a month down there wading through all that material. - They're not in order, then? No. Mark has too many interests outside the newspaper. - Which is why I can not do without you, Anne, my dear. - Mark, it's Paul Barton. - You take care of it. So, I understand that you are interested in the sorority massacres. - Yes. - You know, "The Voice“ sold out for three solid months on that subject. - It's about the school board issue. - Tell him that I'm in a meeting with a writer. What was your magazine? - “National Report.“ - A writer from the "National Report.“ Who happens to moonlight as a psychiatrist at Cresthaven. The sheriff called, huh? - Yes. Mark McGowan. - Joan Gilmore. - Hi. Listen, I'd be interested in any information you might have on Barrington's favorite son. - Wants to talk to you. - Anne, I'll be back shortly. Hi, Paul? - How's this for an idea? You wanna get more information about Johns, right? - Right. - So, like a good investigative reporter, I arrange for you to become an alumnus of the sorority in question. It's mid-semester break. You're passing through town. There are plenty of empty rooms in the sorority house. There you are at the scene of the crime. When you get your patient, I get my story. - Cute idea, country boy. How do I pass myself off as an ex-sorority member? - Anne, in my office, she was a Delta Omega sister. We could borrow her ring. - Well, you've just got it all figured out now, haven't you? - If you run into Lorraine in Ft. Lauderdale, you tell her that I am a little pissed that she didn't say goodbye. Okay? - Okay. - Don't let it bug you. You know she's like that. - Yeah, she's such a snob. - Oh, but she's a sister, you know? - Oh. - Look at those things. - I'll see you. - Bye-bye. - Excuse me, hi. Hi. - My name is Joan Gilmore. I was an Omega sister at Boston and I thought since I'm in town, maybe I could spend the night here? - Yeah. - This is the week to crash. Not many of us left with the fall break and all. - I'm Cheryl, that's Pam, and this is Jane. - Hi. - Pleasure. - Oh, you will have to get permission from old Mrs. Collins. Here she comes. I'm Ms. Collins. It's fine, you're welcome to stay, Miss Gilmore. Would you please help her with taking the bag up? Oh. - I live across the way. Perhaps you would like to come over see me later. Wonderful. - Oh, you can stay in Lorraine's room. - Yeah, we'll put your things away and we'll show you around. - Well, thank you. This could be fun. I feel years younger already. - Come on. - Ooh, this is great. You must like it here, huh? - It's not so great on the holidays with no guys around. - Hey, Omega is the best sorority on campus. - Hey, is it true what I heard in town about this sorority? - Oh, what were they telling you? - Oh, that someone was murdered here a long time ago. - Oh yeah, you mean the Sorority Slaughter. - Please, Cheryl, I don't wanna hear about that. It's true then? - Yeah, blood and guts and everything. - Oh Cheryl, you are really disgusting. - Well, what happened? - It was eons ago. We don't really know the whole story. - Would Mrs. Collins know anything about it? Probably. She's been around forever. And she's a nosy old bag. - She's always spying on us. - If anyone would know the all the gory details, it would be her, but she won't talk about it. - Could we please just change the subject? - Jane, an Omega sister can't be bothered with a little blood. - Let's go. I'll show you the rest of the place. Great. Lead on. - See you guys later. Hello? Oh, Miss Gilmore. Please come in. I'd completely forgotten that you were coming. - Well, actually, it's Dr. Gilmore. Oh. I'm helping myself to a sip of sherry or two. It gets very quiet up here on vacation time. - Oh, that's all right, Mrs. Collins. I can understand. Must be tough taking care of all those girls, hmm? - Then you get fond of them, right? And then they leave. Won't you sit down? - Thank you. It gets lonely. - Yes. It's very lonely. The girls are all I have left now. And Francis is gone. Francis is my son. He loved me. He used to bring me fresh flowers every morning. Then God took him away. Would you like some sherry? - No, no thank you. - Do you have children? - No, I don't. - No? You know, children, they are a gift to the world. I try to protect my girls, my girls against everything, against sickness, against bad grades, against bad boyfriends. - And murder? You were house mother when it happened, weren't you? - What kind of a doctor are you? - I'm a psychiatrist, Mrs. Collins. - You have no right. You really have no right. - It must be very hard. I'm sorry. - Yes, it's hard. I don't sleep nights. I have nightmares. - Tell me about it. It might help. - It was a terrible night. Howard, the house custodian, he always went away, you see. He always went away during pledge week. Hell's week, that's what the girls called it. So this one particular night, he comes back. He could be so disobedient. Girls, you wanna be a Delta Omega sister, you've gotta learn how to take it. He started to spy on the girls. - Come on, Colleen, harder. What's the matter, does it hurt? And he was only 19. Why not? - Don't smile. Oh, those Omega girls, they were something else now. And they knew it. - That creepy guy, Johns? He's watching us. - So what do you wanna do about it? - Oh, let's get rid of these plebs and have some fun with him. - Good idea. They put their pledges through real hell. And they did the same to poor Howard. They even tried to get him drunk. - Howard, Howard, who's that? - Shh! - Who is that, Howard? - What's she doing? Who is that, Howard? They teased him. - Hi. - Who is that? Turn around, get a better look. Turn around. There ya go. He was so humiliated. He was so frightened. So finally he struck back. None of the girls survived. - There must have been more to it than that. - That's all it took. Johns was watching one of their childish initiation ceremonies and they decide to get even with him by giving him a spanking. Unfortunately he wasn't sane enough to handle that kind of treatment. His mind snapped. - Not exactly like something out of a Norman Rockwell. - No, not exactly. - 80, Dr. Gilmore, how does it feel to be a cub reporter on the “Barrington Voice"? - Well, I hadn't really thought about it, but I keep thinking about all those helpless people back at the hospital, and Johns out there somewhere alone. - I think you are being too hard on yourself. It is not your job to take care of every patient 24 hours a day. Leave some work for some of the other doctors. - Mark, I don't trust the other doctors. I think there's something terribly wrong at Cresthaven. - I think I know what it is. - You do? - Sure. Shh. It's a plot. They're spying you. They're all out to get you. Even as we sit here talking, the diabolical Dr. Kruger is lurking nearby, ready to pounce. Okay, okay, I'm sorry. I guess I do sound a little melodramatic, huh? I don't seem to be doing very well right now. - You seem to be doing all right to me. - Oh, I'm not so sure. What if I'm wrong? What if he did die last week? - What if you're right? - Well, if I'm right, I think I'll find John somewhere in Barrington. - Hmm-hmm, and I will be obliged to do the chivalrous thing. - What? - Protect you. My town, ma'am. Guard you every minute. Stay with you throughout the night. Pretty confident, aren't you? - Mm-hmm. - Hi! - Good morning. - Hi. - Good morning. Did you have a good night last night? - It was wonderful. What would you like for breakfast? - Oh, I'll just have some coffee, thanks. - You remember that murder you were asking about yesterday? Yeah. - I'm going upstairs to finish packing. - Well, if you want, I can show you where it happened. Great. When? - Right now. - Now? Why not? - Well, okay. - Wanna go with us? - Count me out. - Okay. Let's go. They used to have their initiation in the boiler room but we can't anymore. - Why not? - Because of the killings. - Ew. Where'd he live? - In a room in the back. We keep our luggage there now. Here we are. This is it. The trouble is, no one will say exactly where it happened. But if you look closely, you can find blood stains almost anywhere on the walls. Hey, what you doin' Messin' around down here? School's over. Get your buns outta here like everybody else. - I'm sorry, Mr. Hammer, we were “lust on our way to the storage room to get our luggage. We're going right away. - Well, go on, but don't go messin' 'round where you don't belong, you hear? Watch for them rats. They keep gettin' bigger and meaner every year. - Rats? - Oh, I don't remember it smelling this bad. Let's get out of here. - Oh, come on, Cheryl, I thought Omega girls were tough. - Immune to a stink like this? No way. I'm getting out of here. This is gross. We were gonna go into town today. Do you wanna go with us? - No thanks. You go ahead. I think I'll stay here and look around some. See ya tonight? - Sure, if you can find your way out. Bye. - Bye. Howard Johns? Why don't we go outsi- Where it's nicer, hmm? Let me go. Help! - What's goin' on? - Oh, Mr. Hackler, please come quickly. There's someone in there. He just grabbed me. What happened to the lights? - Musta blown a fuse. I don't see a damn thing in here. You damn girls sure like to fool around. Come on, I want you outta here now. I said come on, damn it. I got work to do. Cresthaven. - Hello, would you connect me with Dr. Anderson, please? This is Dr. Gilmore. One moment, please. - Cheryl! - Joan, how are you? Why are you calling me on your day off? - Doctor, listen. I found Howard Johns. I'm up in Barrington, New York and I found him. - You've done what? - I found Howard Johns, the psychotic that Kruger said was dead? You've seen him? - Yes, he's here at the Omega sorority. - Well, if you've caught him, I'll have the ambulance sent. No, I was alone and I couldn't stop him, but I know it's him. - All right, now listen, Joan. You stay put. I'll get some of our people up there as fast as I can. - I can't wait. I don't think he's hurt anyone yet, but you're more than three hours away and I think he's violent. I'm on my way to the sheriff's office now. - That sheriff won't be able to handle him. You wait till I get some of our people up there who can cope. - Doctor, I don't trust our people. - Okay, and be careful. - And you did a fine job on this layout. - Well, thank you. - I'll have it blown up. - Good. - Anne, I gotta see Mark. Where is he? - Do you have my ring? - Oh, please, where's Mark? - Ooh! - Oh, Mark, I've seen him. He attacked me. - Who, Johns? - Yes, we've gotta do something right away. - Have you seen Liggett? - No. You've gotta come with me. - Okay, I understand. Maybe this'll get him off his butt. Come on. - Sheriff? - Well, well, well. The sexy shrink returns. Still searching for your phantom psycho? - He's out at the college and I'm afraid he's gonna hurt someone. - You saw the son of a bitch? - Yes, she saw him. Sheriff, there are girls out on that campus right now. If we don't do something, he could go berserk all over again. - Now cool it, McGowan. Don't give me any of your shit. The little lady herself told me he might be dead. Anyway, I'm waiting for some information from the hospital. - But I'm telling you, I've seen him at the school. The security guard was with me. - Hackler? Hackler saw him, too? - Well no, not exactly. Johns was gone when we went back to look. I don't know how, but he must have hidden somewhere. - Oh, I see. - Look, I found his ID bracelet. - Tell us more. - Joan, are you sure it was Johns? - Look, I talked to the hospital yesterday. They told me she never even seen Johns, so how does she know it was him? - It's him. He probably thinks They're the same girls that hurt him 20 years ago. - Did you see him, McGowan? No, I wasn't there. - And what does that tell ya? - Just answer your phone, will ya? - Hello? Yes, put him through. It's the Cresthaven Hospital. - Speak to Dr. Anderson, Sheriff. - Hello? Dr. Kruger. - No, you've gotta speak to Anderson! - Hey, hold it down in my office, will ya? Hello? Yes, Dr. Kruger, did you get my message? - Yes, I believe you called about one of our ex-patients, Mr. Howard Johns. An ex-patient? - Yes, yes, unfortunately you see, he passed away last week whilst in our care. Yes, a sad case, a very sad case indeed, but quite hopeless, I'm afraid. Dr. Anderson? Yes, yes, she's here. Just a moment, Sheriff, I'll get her for you. - Yes, Sheriff. That's right, Howard Johns is deceased. If you'll turn on your facsimile machine we'll send you the death certificate right now. - It's the best news I've had since the mayor dropped dead. - I don't care what they say. Don't you understand? They're trying to cover up. - Look, you said you wanted proof Johns is dead? Dr. Anderson is accommodating you. Boy, I sure am glad that creep is outta the way. He's out there, Sheriff. - Look, lady, forget it. I don't want any trouble. Now, Dr. Anderson, the head of Cresthaven, the very person you wanted me, no, the very person you demanded I talk to said Johns is dead, right? Well, there's your goddamn death certificate, and there's Dr. Anderson's signature, right? That's good enough for me. - He's right, Joan. How can it be a mistake? It can't be Johns. - You're wrong. He's at the school and dangerous. I'm going back. - Wait a minute, let's talk first. - Forget it. - Yeah, forget it. Why don't you just get the fuck outta here and let me in peace, huh? Just because the goddamn broad is so good lookin' don't mean we all have to think with our dicks! Huh? Right! - Well, that should settle the issue. I hope so. - I think you should get Jesse and Virgil up here immediately. - Why? - For all your education, Doctor, you rarely find much use for your mind, do you? We have been forced to put on record the death of Howard Johns. What happens if he should be found alive? - You're not suggesting that we kill him ourselves? - Kruger, I want you to find Jesse this instant and get him up to that college as quickly as possible. Do you understand? - You are suggesting. - Do you understand? - Jesse. - Here are the medical supplies. - You both know what he looks like. I want this job done quietly, no uproars. We want him back, but it's more important that he isn't found. - Dr. Gilmore also? - Oh yes. - Joan, will you at least talk to me? - Why didn't you back me up? - What'd you expect me to do after seeing the death certificate? - I don't know. I just expected you to have a little bit more faith in me. - I'm here, aren't I? You weren't exactly a pillar of truth and wisdom back there. - Wait a minute. Will you believe me now? - Flat tire. Hmm, what's that prove? All right, okay, Joan. But let's keep this to ourselves until we know more. There is no need unnecessarily frightening those girls. - All right, I'll go along with that, as long as I know the girls are safe. Hi, girls. - Hi. - This is Mark. - Oh, so this is Mark. - Hi, Mark. - Those creeps have ruined the tires on my car. - Jane, what creeps? - Oh, you know, the guys from the frat over at Summit College. It's just their idea of fun. - Wait till they get here. Then we'll really have some fun. - Would you guys shut up? You're talking about fun and my vacation is being ruined. Shoulda left an hour ago and I've got a five-hour drive. It's a real crummy way to start a vacation. - Did you call the police? Oh sure, with no phones? They cut the wires. - But what about Mrs. Collins? Isn't her phone working? - No, Mrs. Collins isn't home. The whole place is just locked up. - Listen, I know it would be an inconvenience, but I just wanna get out of here. Do you think you could drop me by the lake? It's only a few miles down the road and my sister and her boyfriend are camping out there. I can get a ride out with them in the morning. - Could you excuse us just a minute? Joan. - Ha! Where did she find him? - I'm never gonna get outta here. - I don't know. Oh, don't worry. - What do you wanna do? We still don't know if there's anything to worry about. - And what if there is? It'll be okay. - Yeah, well, we can't all fit in your car. Will you relax? Don't worry about it. - I won't leave them alone. - Okay, how about this? The lake's near my house. I'll drop Jane off, call telephone repair from my place, and be back here in a half hour. Will you relax? Don't worry about it. - Okay. - You'll get there. You don't have to drive. - All right, girls, listen up. This is probably a simple prank. Just to be safe, I want you to lock up and stay together. I'll drop Jane off and be back here in no time. - Okay. - I'll even call George's Shell station, have someone come over here and fix your tires. - Bye-bye, guys. - Bye. - See ya, Jane. - Have fun. - Yeah. - Okay, let's lock up. I'll go upstairs and get changed, be down in a minute. - Okay, time to lock up. - Whatever. - Bringin' back these nuts is always a hassle. I'm gonna enjoy this one. I'm gonna shove this hypo in her tight ass and twist it around before I squeeze a little juice. And then when she goes under, and we got her pants down anyway. Get my drift, Virgil? Yes, sir, Dr. Gilmore, member of the staff, you're gonna have one hell of a ride back. - I think you've forgotten that we've gotta get Johns out also. And you don't remember how fucking big he is. - Shit, Virgil. One loose nut looks like another loose nut. A little electric prod sets 'em straight and then a blast of Thorasil makes 'em 'bout as dangerous as a bag of laundry. - Why did ya have to let him out? - Because that's what the computer told me to do. I was just followin' orders. - Oh, yeah, yeah. You are an asshole, ain't ya? - Yeah. Oh my God. What the he“ has gone on here? Stay in the car. No. My sister. - Jane. - What happened? - Get back in the car! Stay there. - No, no! - Stay there! - I can't! What happened? - Stay back there. Jane, stay there. - Where are they? - Stay there. - Paul, Susan, what happened? Please! - Goddamn it, get back there! They're in there. Susan! Paul, what happened? - Just relax. - Where are they? Oh my God. No! Susan! Get back! - Susan! - Stand back. Get away from there. - Susan, oh no! God! - Oh my God. - Susan! - Oh my God. - We gotta help her. We gotta help her! - Oh my God. - Susan, no! - There's nothing we can do. Come on! - Susan! Let's get out of here. - Susan, no. - Come on, get out of here. - We gotta help her. - We've gotta get the police. Come on, Liggett, get off the goddamn phone. Jane, I want you to do something for me. I've got to go back to the college. I want you to call the sheriff. Can you do that? Jane, for Christ sakes you have got to help me. There's the sheriff's number, now call him. Tell him what happened out at the campsite. Tell him I've gone back to the sorority and for him to get out there as fast as possible. Can you do that? Yes. - Keep calling until you get him. Okay? - Yes. - Isn't that her car? - Bingo, Virgil! Let's have some fun. Let's get her. - Ya know, I really think you're overreacting to all this. I mean, the guys from the college are just always pulling crap like this. They enjoy scaring us. - Did anybody bolt the cellar door? - What for? The guys don't know about the basement tunnels, and even if they did, they can't get in that way. - Oh my God. - Look out behind you! Oh shit! Oh no. Go. Stop. Shit. Go, slash. He'll find you. Oh! Stop. Oh God, don't die! Oh God. Hmm. - Oh wait, Joan! Joan, hurry! Oh my God. Oh, oh my God! Joan! Joan, hurry! Hurry, Joan. - Cheryl! Pam? - You idiots! You're outta your mind! You coulda killed me! - I'm really sorry, mister. We're from Cresthaven Hospital. - You're from the hospital? Oh thank heavens. Dr. Gilmore's right. Johns may be here, and if he is he's dangerous. We've gotta catch him. - That's right, mister, we're just trying to find Dr. Gilmore. - You don't understand! He may have killed some people already. If we don't- - Restrain him, throw him in the back, then bring me my things. I'm gonna go look for them. Ah, Dr. Gilmore. We wanna talk to you. - Johns is here. He's killed two people. Please help me. - Sure. - Dr. Gilmore. Come to Daddy, baby. Nothin' to be afraid of. - No. - Get her! Come on, Doc. Open up. - Jesse, pick the lock. - All right, Doc. We're gonna shoot some Thorasil right up your ass. Miss high and mighty. Turn you into a dumb piece of meat. Our meat! She's got the door blocked. - Damn it! I'll fix that bitch. No! No! No! No! No! - Jesse. Jesse. Jesse. Jesse! - What? - Jesse. Jesse. Come on, they're getting away. - All right. - Come on. - All right! - Come on. Come on. They had to come this way. The rest of the house is locked. - He's been bangin' his head on these lamps, big fuckin' hick. - Jesse, shut up. - Wait till I get my hands on him. Shh, on the other side. - All right, all right. - Nothing. Jesse, down there. That's it. Come here. It's the boiler room. - Let's get him. Look who we have here. All wrapped up like a Christmas present. - Careful, Johns is here, too. - Hello, Dr. Gilmore. I got another report to put in your file. Virg. - Johns! Jesse, the cattle prod! - Dumb son of a bitch almost killed me! - Jesse, that's enough. That's enough, Jesse! - Don't worry, Doc. I'm not gonna give it to ya. Not yet. We came to save you, Doc. And bring ya home. Home to Ward I. Home forever. You're the Iivin' dead now. Shit, Virgil, I can't see a goddamn thing. - Turn on alight, you moron. - Come on, you do it for me. I'll owe ya a big one. - Don't bruise her too much. I don't want ya to worry. Don't worry. Don't worry. You won't be lonely. - What the hell? - You're gonna get lots of special attention. Yeah, that's it, the motion of the ocean. - Jesse! - No! No! Mr. Hackler. Oh, Mark! - Take the gun. Take the gun. It won't shoot! - Release the safety! Joan! Johns! - Help! Francis. Francis, oh forgive me, my son. No! No! No! Not you, you slut, you. You whore, you leave my boy alone. You slut whore! You leave my boy alone, you leave... You stop that! You leave my boy alone, you whores, you sluts. - And so history repeats itself. With the discovery of 11 bodies brutally murdered, tragedy has once again struck the small town of Barrington, New York. 17 years after Dark Sunday when a similar massacre took place, the sisters of Delta Omega Sorority found themselves once again... - Well, I guess I arrested the wrong guy. - Howard Francis Johns. He was her son. Mrs. Collins killed the girls 20 years ago. Well, she told me all about it, about how the boy was illegitimate and she had the baby secretly and gave him her maiden name. Then she got him a job on campus so she could keep her eye on him. - Being mute, he couldn't defend himself. - Well, I wouldn't say that. - Meanwhile across the state, the senior staff of Cresthaven Hospital has been suspended pending criminal investigation. This is Ralph Miller, KTNN News. Now back to the studios. - Leaving already, huh? Nothin' to keep you here? - Oh Mark, I've gotta get back. Oh, I almost forgot Anne's ring. Well, looks like you just have to come to New York and get it. - No, what I'm gonna do is go back to my office like a professional newspaper man, get to work on the biggest story to hit Barrington in 20 years. Like he“ I am. Wow!
