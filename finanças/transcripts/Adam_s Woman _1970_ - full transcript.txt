O'shea's elixir. Burn your belly so bad, you'll forget all about your back. Want some more, eh? Now, you took your lashing like a man. You going to cringe now before a wee bit of home brew? Pure Irish poteen branded with tasmanian rum and a sprinkle of holy water to keep the leprechauns from whispering any more damn foolishness in your ear about escape. Don't try it again. Keep it moving! Keep it low there. Keep it low. Ho! Close, Dyson. Look alive. Move it! Keep it level. Move it! Keep up the beat. Now! [Twirr] Help, guard! Help! Hurry, man under! Man under. Help! Hurry up. Come on. Leg iron's tangled in a branch right here. Where is he? Quick, before he drowns. Give me the keys. The keys, quick! Get those men out of there! Corporal! We made it. Ha ha. Aah! Shh! Shh, shh! Easy now. Shh! No one's going to hurt you. Shh. That's my girl. Who are you, love? Millie. What's a pretty girl like you doing here... In a bed of spinach? Running away from a sheepman. Ha ha! She's a whore. I'm no common whore, you filthy lag. I work for the duchess. The duchess? Mm-hmm. Madame of the rocks herself. Now, that's the place we want to go if we want to be shanghaied. Ahh. The duchess, huh? How much can you pay? Oh, you set the price. His daddy owns half of Boston. Who asked you? Nobody. You haven't a crooked farthing between you. But an honest face and a pure heart. What more could you want? Money. And you'd be worth every penny. What is your name, yank? Adam beecher. Son of a Boston banker. Your grace. You are almost as good a liar as I am. I wouldn't believe it, either, but it's the bloody truth. And I suppose once home, you'll ship me a handsome sum through my yankee captain. How nice. That's up to you, your grace. Help me... Or hang me. Wait here. I say we clear out of here before she sells US for the reward money. The captain of the clipper is downstairs in his cups. The maid's coming to fetch him. They'll weigh anchor at midnight. I'll slip you on board just before she sails. So you haven't much time. You...out. Come on, you handsome fella. Ha ha ha! Hey! Not so rough, you cheeky lag! Pleasure. Be careful with the buttons, darling. They're real velvet. Aah! Aah! And where else would I find my bloody yank, eh? Ha ha ha ha. They've come, Bart! Woman: Aah! Dyson! Sergeant. Robby's dead. Get out! A man was killed as a result of your escape attempt. You are thus as guilty as your accomplice. Sir... Therefore, it is the judgment-- may I address the court before you pass sentence? Even a convicted murderer has that right. Speak, sir. I'm no murderer, sir. I'm an innocent man. I was in england on business for my father when I was waylaid by robbers. The next morning, I awoke in jail to find myself accused of a crime I knew nothing about. In the blink of an eye, I was on a convict ship bound for Australia. I tried to tell them, here, sir, but no one would listen. The American consul can verify-- there is no American consul. Then I ask to see the governor. [Tapping gavel] Adam beecher, the sentence of this court is that you be hanged by the neck until you are dead. May the lord have mercy on your soul. Damn it, I'm innocent! Next case. You asked to see this, sir. 2 execution orders, sir, and an urgent request for more troopers at parramatta. Help me on with this... Infernal contraption, Alex. But, sir, you-- you have a dozen appointments. They're lining up outside. Did you not see all those people outside, sergeant? A matter of life or death, sir. Sergeant, um... O'shea, sir. Served under you in India, sir. O'sh--aah! General, are you all right, sir? I see. Every time you straighten up, the bloody thing bites into your neck. General, sir, could I have a word? The poor devils worked on the roads like this? No wonder one died of slow strangulation. Sir, a man is about to die of strangulation, but it'll not be slow. Alex, I want an order relieving major Bowen of his command at moreton bay. It's on your desk, sir. I anticipated your decision, sir. He's an American citizen, sir. This one seems to be bloody well stuck. Alex, get this. General, sir, will you listen to me? An innocent man has been condemned to death. Who says he's innocent? I do, sir. Who sentenced him? Chief magistrate Barrett. Barrett? The lad's to be hanged at noon, sir. I see. On your feet. Out. Stand to, yank. You're in the presence of the governor. A Burmese prince gave this to me some years ago. He said if I rub the little fellow's belly, he'd help me make wise decisions. But when I read him your testimony, not a word out of him. His belly just rumbled. I'm going to find out about you if it takes me months to get a proper report back from our embassy in the United States. Meanwhile, I've commuted your sentence to 20 years. 20 years? I'd damn well rather hang than spend one more hour in this bloody dungeon that you call Australia! My word! So you've commuted the sentence I gave him. Yes, to 20 years. Didn't your informants tell you that, too? With one stroke of your pen, you've undermined the authority of every magistrate in this colony. No, what I've done is cover my yardarm against any possibility of diplomatic action. If that American boy goes to the gallows and his story's true, heads will roll. And mine will be first into the basket. That's not why you spared him. You're more interested in your miserable convicts than you are in the men who built this country-- the landowners. What would this country be without US? We've made it what it is with our toil, our sweat, with our capital, our enterprise. And above all, with your cheap convict labor. I don't deny it. It's made Australia. Made it what, sir? A dumping ground for england's misery? A stinking jail? When I first came here as governor, I had high hopes that I could work with you and all the other big landowners. I thought I could persuade you it's in your own interest to help me with the changes I wanted to make. Yes, I actually thought that you would help me. Help you? A man who wants to give away my grazing lands to ex-convicts? There's even a rumor you intend to mate prison whores with murderers and set them free to colonize the bush country. That's no rumor. That's an ideal. You don't deny it. I'm sure London doesn't know what you're up to behind their backs. You've gone too far this time, sir Philip. You've insulted me personally by overruling my sentence. I'm sending a letter to lord Brent with a full list of your radical ideas. Please do that, sir. And, believe me, mine won't be the only signature on that letter. The bloody yank. Will you look at him-- big as life. Thought you'd be in hell by now. Wish I was. 2-double-1-7-- beecher. Cheated the bloody hangman, did you? [Laughing] Woe to you, Satan! Scarlet woman! Burn in everlasting flames for your sins. Jezebel! Fornicator! Just mad Jack the holy man, giving them his blessing with a Bible and a few rocks. Bride's from the female factory, so he figures she must be a whore. The old coot always finds out when a convict lass gets married. They offer a Grant of land to any ex-convict who marries a female prisoner. That's enough. Back to work. I'd like to see the governor. You'll see hell first. [Laughing] [Laughter] "Striking a corporal, "fomenting unrest among the convicts, "starting a work stoppage, leading a food riot." All to get yourself sent here to me. What am I supposed to do, applaud your cleverness or ship you back to the flogging post? Why don't you just set me free? Can you think of a better way to get rid of me? Don't be insolent, beecher. I'm serious. I'll take a chance on a prison bride. Dowry grants are for ex-convicts, not for serving prisoners. Uh, excuse me, sir, but I heard word for another scheme-- for the rehabilitation of convicts. You'll get more work out of US that way than with whips and chains. I've lived on a farm. I know how to work the land. Beecher, you'd be the very last one I'd pick. Sir, you're thinking that I'd like to do a bolt, and you could be right, but-- sir, I know I wouldn't have a chance. Just between you and me and the sergeant, if I did happen to escape... Would you really miss me that much? Sergeant, get him out of here. May I remind the governor that I've also worked as a carpenter? [Door slams] That boy troops in here with the very same harebrained scheme I've already proposed to London. Alex, it's a sign. Sir, not him? I know--barely into his britches. Probably make a botch of it and end up back on the gallows. How our chief magistrate and his cronies would roar if we picked him as our first convict bridegroom. All he wants is to tweak your nose and sail off into the sun. Of course, but who knows what could happen to a clever rascal if we set him down in the bush with a girl and a piece of earth? You can't be serious. Why not? This land is doomed unless we give our convicts a stake in it-- some reason to hope, a challenge, a sense of pride. As a "ticket of leave" man, Alex, you should know that better than I do. Aye, sir. Besides... I think that boy deserves one of our charming ladies from the female factory. * now, listen, you women * at home in old england * don't go for to steal neither money nor grub * * they'll take you and chain you * * and ship you to the colonies * * you'll suffer 10 years as a slave at the tubs * Oh, your honor, I'm so glad you got my message, sir. I have just what you've been lookin' for. Which one? The middle tub. Sweet as dew on your grass, sir. Just came in on the last convict ship. I was certain you'd like her. Make a fine kitchen maid. Not like that last one. I was so sorry about that mcguire-- I prefer not to be reminded of that bitch! I'll take her. Oh, you won't be sorry, sir. I wanted you to have your choice before they're picked over by the convicts. You didn't know, sir? The governor is about to offer the dowry Grant to lags. There's one coming tomorrow for a bride. The matron'll try to pawn off one of her troublemakers on you. So look close. Stop it. Get back there. Get in the line. A shilling you don't pick any. Woman: Leave me alone leave me alone. Ahh, lucky day for you, lad. Choice of me best girls you have. All good workers. Sound of wind and limb. No lice or fever, and gone over each and every one by the doctor. Primed and ready for the marriage bed. See one that strikes your fancy? Well, don't be shy, yank. Take your pick. Maybe the gent would like to have a closer look at one of our ladies. Hetty. Hello, dearie. I'm Hetty green. I'll treat you right. You'll see I will. I'm a good girl. One of the best, Hetty. Please. Please, mister, take me with you. I'll love you. Swear I will. I can't bear it here one more day. Please! [Whimpers] Take her away. Agnes. I said Agnes. Get out of it. Don't you touch me. Ahh, now. Here's a prize. Our Agnes. Say hello, dear. Well... Smile at the gentleman so he can see how pretty we are. [Sobbing] Agnes, I wish I could, uh... Oh, don't worry about the little one. We'll take care of that here at the factory. I'll see she gets over her weep soon enough. Me name's Maggie graves, sir. From a good Christian home. Me father's a sexton, married to me mother. And if it's god's will you should choose me, sir, I'll serve you faithfully, as I serve him. Thank you, Maggie. Is that all you've got to say? I'll take you right up to heaven every bleeding night, I will. Go rot in hell, you yankee bastard! Anne. Rest your peepers on me, love. And you can see you're picking yourself a good cook. Feed you like a fighting cock fat, I will. Aah! Just one of our shy ones. She may seem a bit skittish, but-- wild Irish. 7 years for thieving. It was only 2 loaves of bread she stole. I admit she had a bit of trouble when we assigned her as a housemaid, but shaving her head soon cured that. Half killed her employer with a meat ax. All she needs is a proper man to calm her down. And you might be just the one, lad. We'll have her out here for you in just a-- aah! You silly bitch. Come on. Don't struggle. Come on. Take her back. Are we going to crawl in the hay with the likes of that every night, eh? Well, yank, which of the little beauties are you going to have your 2 minutes with? 2 minutes... To make up your mind. [Door closes] Hello. I've come to pick a wife. You'll do. Did you hear me? I said-- Irish bitch! Any trouble in there? No. Just having a little chat, matron. Get out. Shut up. Now, I'm not gonna touch you. That's not why I want a wife. You'll be my passport out of this bloody land. First chance I get, I'll escape. All that land, it'll be yours when I'm gone. Time's up. Can it be any worse than this hell? She's agreed. Wilt thou, convict beecher, have this woman for thy wedded wife? I do. Wilt thou, convict mcguire, have this man for thy wedded husband? She does. The woman can answer for herself. Do you want him or not? Don't yell at her. What was that? No, she's very nervous. Don't make it worse. I've a mind to return you two to prison. May I remind the reverend the governor intends this couple to pioneer his colonization plan. I will not be lectured by a convict. All I ask is you show a little respect for a lady-- lady? Get them out of here. I will. Will what? I will... Have him for me husband, sir. I declare you married. Next. Next! This way. Your dowry Grant, Mr. Beecher. The sergeant will locate the tract for you. You owe me a shilling. Meet our guardian angel. Matron, there must be some poor woman in the factory who'll take this shilling for a kerchief to cover, uh, her head. Thank you, matron. That's my wedding present. We'd best get going, yank. Luck go with you, lad. Tell the governor we're grateful. Hyah! Come on. * away to the bushland let US ride * * on a journey picked for a newfound bride * * the reins in my hand and you for my bride * * come ride with me to the bushland * * come ride with me to the bush * * we'll ride where the mountains tower high * * and climb to where near where they touch the sky * * and down on the far side you and I * * will make our home in the bushland * * come ride with me to the bush * dismount. On the wheel. Come on. Hyah! Come on! Come on! Ho! * we'll cross where the river shallows spill * * and ride all day in the sun until * * we find a place on the side of a hill * * and spend our days in the bushland * * come ride with me to the bush * Whoa. Well, there it is. I never saw so much land and sky. Does it have a name? A name? Huh. Where you from, Irish? Nowhere. They pulled down our village when we couldn't pay the rents. Must have been called something once. Kilmorin. County Clare. I christen this valley kilmorin. Stop here. Whoa. Did you ever think you'd see that bald-headed wildcat down on her knees in prayer? Oh, the downs will make fine Meadow for the sheep. And wheat and corn and spuds, they can go in beyond the rise. And those trees... And a bark hut right there beside the river, and-- is here all right with you? Doesn't matter. You're the man. You decide. Before I forget, here's something to brighten your wedding night. What is it? Now, need you ask, and you an Irish lass? Your husband is well-acquainted with its magical powers. It cures everything from a skinned knee to a broken heart. Smile at it, and it smiles back. Feel lonely, and it'll sing to you. O'shea's elixir of love and marriage. Not one damn gun in the supplies. Will you not interrupt me when I'm charming your wife? How's a man to hunt game and protect himself? Expect they'd pass out firearms to convicts? You've a fishing pole and a snare. And as for protection, I'm setting up a guard post the other side of the hill. Bushrangers have been waylaying wagons. We're to keep an eye out. For bushrangers or me? I expect we'll be dropping in on you once in a while just to make sure you haven't perished of easy living. Still my bloody jailer, huh? Good day to you both. Oh, and a good life. Well, that tent won't put itself up. [Crow cawing] Somebody plucked our little chicken clean, eh? Got your tail feathers, too, dearie? Dyson. Tail-high on the windowsill of a whorehouse-- that's how I'll always remember you. You flew off so fast, you missed all the fun. Well, well, well. Hey, I hated to leave you, yank, but you seemed to be doing so good on your own, and I did have a pressing appointment elsewhere, remember? Every man for himself-- the only way to live. I knew you'd understand, Adam. Hey, boys, meet the yank. Hadn't been for his self-sacrifice, old Bart would still be breaking rocks for her majesty the queen, god bless her. Put those guns away. He's one of US. What are you doing here? I heard the governor was settling lags down here, so I thought we'd ride over and pay our compliments. But I didn't know I was going to find you here and married... To a female factory wench. Pleased to meet you, Mrs. Beecher. [Laughing] Well, she ain't the duchess, but she'll do on a dark night. Ah. Can I help you with something? What do you want? You ain't got nothing worth taking, yank, so I may as well take you. That's very funny. I saw the sergeant riding out of here. So why don't you come with US? I'd like to, mate, but I'm a husband now. True. I got a wife to bed down tonight. You're a husband. Ha ha ha. He says he's a husband. Grow a little hair on her and fatten her up a bit, and I might come back and give you a hand. Give me the buns. Mrs. Beecher... For your wedding breakfast. A present from your old mate Bart Dyson... Your new landlord. You build a fire. I'll skin them. Unh. And stay out! My tent blew down. Well, you're not coming in here. Come near me, I'll murder you. What are you doing? What's it look like I'm doing? Well, you can't. Get out. I'm soaked. Turn your back. No man tells me what to do in my own bed. Oh. You want to drown? If I wanted you, Irish, I'd take you if you had 3 bald heads and a tattoo on your tail. Put your scarf back on and go to sleep. Why don't you try a prayer to the virgin? About time you got back. Where's the horse? Oh, I don't know. He must have heard about all that work you had in mind for him. Are you going to do your share or not? Then to hell with you. Good day. Aye, isn't it a glorious day, Mrs. Beecher? I want to go back. Back? To prison. I'll throw me things in the bag, and we're off. What did he do to you? It's what he didn't do. All he wants to do is lie under a tree and twiddle his toes. Maybe if you gave him another chance... I'm not about to bow and scrape before a lazy rich man's son. It's work or starve in this world, and, since his highness won't work, I'm not about to stay and starve with him, because I know what it's like. I'd rather be in prison. If she goes back, you go back with her. By order of the general himself. Load up. I'll have you back my nightfall. Tell her I'll do anything she wants. She'll listen to you. What if I don't want her to listen to me? What's the governor going to think of you if you bring US back after one night, his precious colonization scheme? Oh, sergeant, I'm sorry. It wasn't meant for you. It's just his britches-- wet in the rain last night, and he took them off to dry them. Well, now that's me things. Is it all right if I ride double with you? The yank says he'll work, do whatever you want. Will he, the liar? He'll have to go back to his chains, too. A lass who'd go down on her knees to the holy family over a piece of wild land isn't the sort to give up without a fight, even if she is saddled with Satan himself. Give it another go. Sure, what can you lose? He'll do anything I say? Uhh! Damn it! I'm not trying to rape you. Your head. You're bleeding. Sit there. Ooh! What the devil is that? O'shea's elixir. If you could see your face. Sun and wind will do the healing. Your horse is thirsty, ma'am. Ah, no. We've half a field to plow. I've given you a rough go, haven't I, yank? Your time will come. Ho! Ho ho! Hah! Ho! Ho ho! Ho! Ho! Hah! I won them in a round of dice. This sheepman sold out to go looking for some fancy woman. What to do with 12 woollies, 3 in a family way? I decided to give them to a lovely lady who may be starting a family herself some day. I'm much obliged, sergeant, but save your honeyed words for your pregnant sheep. Father Christmas. You trying to trap me here with an army of bloody sheep? None of your damn business what I do! Now if you brought her a horse... There's a few wild ones running in the hills. Borrow one of my trooper's mounts. Tomorrow we'll have a go at roping one. Make it a mare. It's about time I put a female in front of my plow. Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah hyah! [Neighs] Oh, you got yourself your female, yank. Lady, your time will come. [Neighs] Oh, her time came, all right. Aw, shut your mouth., she's a bloody backbreaker. Give her time to repent her sins and get used to that saddle. We'll take turns going up on her tomorrow. Rub his leg with a drop of elixir. Sergeant, I've work to do. [Neighs] Yank! Ohh! Adam! There, there. Shh. Whoa. Whoa. There. There. There. He's a foolish donkey, dear, with more pride than sense. Take pity on him, dear. Do it for me, one female to another. Easy. There now. We're a fine pair, the two of US. You see? You tamed her. She's yours now. Help me up. My leg. Help yourself. I've supper to cook. Irish, I'm coming out. You proper? Irish! [Door opens] You want me as bad as I want you. Please don't touch me. I got 7 more years for what I did to the last man who tried to take me like that. Bitch! Who do you think you are, the virgin queen? All I want is what any man wants. And don't tell me you didn't get it on that bloody convict ship. Yank, I'm sorry. I'm s-sorry. 16 I was. First night out, the sailors came down... Picked the ones they wanted. I fought them. 4 of them held me down... And the mate came at me, laughing. And then the others, one by one. If you want me to keep my hands off you... You stop looking so damn much like a woman. [Horse approaching] Adam? Get! Hey, where's your man? I finally got lucky. Well. And a merry good morning to you, too. What can I do for you today? Want me to plow the south 40? Split some logs for the sheep pen? Maybe I could fashion you a royal chastity belt. I almost froze out there lying in that damn bush last night. If you'd been here where you belong, maybe Dyson wouldn't have run off with half my sheep and your horse. They go toward the caves? I think so. Hey, you're not going after them on foot? They'll be on the other side of the hills by now. You must be daft! [Crow cawing] [Click] That's it. Beautiful. Hey, Bart, look what I found. Yank! Bart come and took me from the duchess. I missed you, yank. What's wrong with you? Give her a squeeze. What's mine is yours. What's yours is mine. Right? Plenty more where that came from. Where's the rest... And my horse? Look, it ain't going to work, mate. You'll never make a farmer. There's only one kind of life for a young rouser like you, and that's my kind. Come on, now, Millie, back to work. The yank and me want to talk. Come on. Do your job. Nothing sweeter than stolen meat, huh, Bart? Whether it's a sheep... Or a whore. Well, I tell you, it ain't a bad life. Everybody has to work, of course, except US, that is. We collect... Not enough to break anybody, mind you. 'Cause we want them there building and breeding the next time their rent is due. Sit down. Why don't you come in with US? Share and share alike. You get the swag, and I get the rope. You've got a great sense of humor, Adam. No, the law will never touch US this time, not with you planning the larks. We could run this whole cockeyed country. All I want is some way to ship out. You owe me that much. All right. The rocks and port Jackson, there's no chance there. You need to get downriver. I have a small boat. An opium packet runs the coast from Sydney on the dark of the moon. I know the captain. I could talk to him. I've done a little trading with him. Maybe he could get you to Melbourne. There you could get a clipper. How much? The sheep will do. But take that damn mare back because none of my boys can ride her. What about the lag woman? She'll have the land. That's all she wants. Irish! She must have tossed one of them off. Found her west of the hills. Not a sign of the sheep. 6 left. 3 about to lamb. We'll need a shelter. I'll have one up by dark tomorrow. You've work of your own to finish. I hope you don't plan to float that handsome boat without caulking it first. Want me to put the tar on to boil? Whoa. Whoa, there. Whoa. Bloody yank. I thought you'd be gone with the first stiff breeze. Heard how good you and your woman were making out. Thought we'd give it a go. We're planting them on the other side of the valley. It's a big country. Why'd you bring them here? You're going to show those greenhorns all about the plow and seed. Like hell I will. You're still a lag and you'll do what you're told. All right, sergeant. What are we waiting for? Come on! Water your horses. Then I'll show you your new home. * it's dig a bit, and it's pull a bit * * and it's clear off this land * * and it's slavin' like a lunatic * * which I never had planned * * I'm a gentleman * and not used to it * and I'm no pioneer * I would sooner be a-sittin' down, sir * * with a pint of cold beer * we'll try to get the center beam up in the morning. I'll be over to give you a hand. Good night, ladies. Good night, Adam. Thank Bess for the sack of spuds. Good night, Adam! Good night. Adam! Adam! [Sheep bleating] Adam! Adam, quick! The sheep's caught. [Baa] Hurry! [Baa] She's near. Scratch her behind the ear. It relieves her pain if she knows you love her. There now, milady, there. It won't be long now, not at all. * I will hoist my sail to the winds * * oh, lo, my little drummer boy * * I'll not return till St. Charles Eve * help, please. He's after me with his knife! Don't let him get me! Let me go! I'll cut her bleeding heart out. Only she ain't got none. Mad dog! Kill her, and we're all in for it. She's my woman, you light-fingered dip. I'll do with her as I please. The hell you will! We're all in this together, and we'll all be the judges of what happens around here. Now... Let's hear it, cosh. It's not just her stealing rum from my friends. It's not her drinking. That I can take. But the other. At night. To charge me for it! "Keeping the score," she says. 2 Bob a ride. A girl has to put something by for a rainy day. Bow street whore! Cheapjohn cockney bastard! Shut up, both of you! You're a wife now. Learn to live with him, or it's back to the factory. And you! A woman's like a good dog. You pat her on the head, and she'll wag her tail, but you kick her every night, you'll wake up with her teeth in your rump. Yank, quick. Come on, now. Found them lying outside on the hill about to drop their lambs. This one's big enough for twins. [Baa] You must have dipped into the winter larder for that one, Irish. That's a banquet fit for a king... Or even a yank. I'm going to take a walk. I won't be back. You knew it had to come. I never lied to you about that. You have neighbors now. You won't be alone. O'shea won't blame you for my escape. All you've done, he'll see they let you keep the land. Stop looking at me like some bloody sheep in labor! I kept my part of the bargain! The way you talked last night. You think I want some whore's belly slit and o'shea flapping down on US again? Is that all it meant? That's all. I have my own life to live. If I thought I could stop you by taking a knife to you, I'd do it. Forget me, Irish. You'll make some good man a proper wife. Don't you understand? You're damn well rid of me. If you want me, you can have me... Now. Top of the morning to you, missus. How they look when you roust them out of the hay at first light, that's my measure of a woman. Any man who'd go off and leave a morsel like you on a plate... Deserves to be hung. Where's Adam? "Where's Adam?" He's in chains by now, sweating out the rope. I cashed him in. Hyah! Dyson, troopers! His excellency, general sir Philip MacDonald, ma'am. Governor of new south wales. Never mind about all the fanfare and gold braid, sergeant. Good afternoon, Mrs. Beecher. I'm just here to look around. I find the view quite lovely. Starting with yourself. You're close enough to the blarney stone to give it a lick. Won't you come in and have a cup of tea? Adam is just hunting on the other side of the hill there. Oh, I'll find him. It's not very fancy, sir but-- don't apologize. A good farmer always puts his first year's labor where it counts-- in the land. Mrs. Beecher, I've something to say to you. If you'll be good enough to let that tea brew itself... Mr. Muir is a very determined man. He finally unearthed the truth about your ruckus with magistrate Barrett. It grieves me a great deal to learn what he did to you. We've decided to overrule the additional sentence. Since your original term has now run out... You're a free woman. It means you're free. You can go where you like... Or stay here... If you have a mind to. And Adam? Adam was convicted of a capital crime. His 20 years must stand. Please, sir. Don't think I'm ungrateful, but don't tell Adam about this. Sergeant, help Mrs. Beecher with the tea. Good afternoon, beecher. I want to see what you've been up to. Caught you at a bad time, haven't I? Perhaps I should have given you another day or two to dry your soggy spirits after your little dip in the sea. You were a fool to try it, beecher. You might be flattered to know your Dutch captain wanted 50 gold sovereigns for you. Our chief magistrate would have been delighted to pay it. Have you no sense of how close you came to dancing a hornpipe for the hangman? If you're going to clap me in irons, do it and be done. That wasn't exactly my intention. Then why are you here, governor? Are Boston gentlemen always so blunt? So you finally got your report on the "Boston gentleman"? Actually, it wasn't that much of a lie. My father is a wealthy old goat. Unfortunately, he never married my mother. So like all poor yankee bastards, I went to sea, jumped ship in liverpool, ended up in jail, and here I am. King of the kangaroo. I want to take a look, see how you plowed the hill. I see you cut your furrows on the bias so they catch the rain. Excellent. You didn't come here to talk about the rain, governor. No, I didn't. One day I hope to see a town, a thriving town built by convicts, but that will never happen unless someone with a dream leads the way... Someone like you, Adam beecher. Me? Oh, sir. I'm no bloody dreamer. No, but you're young, you're stubborn, and you're a leader. Excuse me for saying so, your excellency, but, uh... You must be daft. Indeed I may be, but hear me out. Barrett and his hounds are baying after me, and they've got friends in London. I may have a year, even less before they recall me. You give me your best for that one year, and I'll move heaven and earth to secure you a pardon. How long will it take, 20 years? You've tried escape and failed. You want your freedom. This is the only way. How can I be sure of the pardon? All you have is my word, just as all I have is your word. Anybody who'd trust me is a bloody fool. Then shake the hand of a bloody fool, and let's call it a fair bargain. 25 shillings. Adam. * we're home now, home to stay * * here in a good land * where the clear skies smile * * where warm winds fill the day * * and there is bird song * all the while * at last now we can live * * here in our own land * with no need to roam * we know where we belong * * this is our own place * * this is home Adam... Here's your food and some for the others. Morning, Bess. Morning. Thank you. Kneel, Edward Barrett. Arise, sir Edward. [Applause] Congratulations, sir Edward. Please convey my humble gratitude to her majesty on your return to england. Congratulations, sir Edward. May I express my appreciation to our distinguished governor for helping to make my day such a memorable one? Thank you, sir. Shall we discuss that charter with his excellency? Am I still the governor, lord croyden? Of course. Then I won't waste your time or mine discussing a charter that would give away new south wales to a chief magistrate who's done all in his power to line his pocket at the crown's expense. And harass my people at kilmorin. I will not be vilified by a man who undermines British morality by setting convicts loose to fornicate on crown lands! While we're on that subject, sir, what would you say of a gentleman who amuses himself by lifting the skirts of convict girls chained to his kitchen floor? Does that qualify him to be knighted for upholding British morality? If you were 10 years younger, I would thrash you! Try it. I'd be happy to waive the 10 years. I won't have this. Lord croyden, you've been here long enough to know what responsible people think of the governor. You have every authority to dismiss him. I ask you, sir, in light of all the evidence and the signed petition which I presented to you, must we wait any longer? You'll wait and see kilmorin and judge for yourself, or I'll raise such a howl the queen herself will hear me. I'll make my own decision and in my own time. I have a great deal more evidence to take. I certainly want to see kilmorin for myself. Thank you, sir. We shall expect you at the end of the month. Whoa. I knew it. It had to be. The seventh this month. Sun and fresh air. You can't top it for putting ginger in your man. When they're working night and day, how do they find the time? I bet you can't wait to tell him. I can't, but I will. He has enough to worry him. After the governor's visit will be soon enough. Dyson again. They stole our wagonload of black powder. Adam and the sergeant went after him. Need a light, mate? Don't just stand there! Get those bloody horses! Bess, come save me, woman! Adam! I was about to remove my britches when that jezebel there winked at me. Naturally I called my wife. You like the dress then? Oh, it's a lovely thing. I'd ask her to dance, only my wife is the jealous type. Bess, you're not worried about tomorrow? I don't want them to come. We're bloody well ready for them, aren't we? Why should we have to parade ourselves like prize horses at one of their grand shows? Nobby, Annie, you, me, and the rest of them. We could win 100 ribbons, and they'd still look down their noses at US. We'd still be nothing but bloody horses to them. You can make me smile, it can't be that bad. Come on now. Give US a grin! Mother in heaven! Pins! I've spilled pins! That's 3 years' bad luck. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, 7 more! It's 10 years' good luck. It's just a superstition, luv. You know that. I'm scared, Adam. I'm just an ignorant girl. I'll spoil it all for you. The pardon, everything. Shut me up in the attic until it's over-- will you stop talking like that now? You're a lovely woman, Bess. And I'm proud to have you as my wife. I know what I am-- a bloody bog rat posing as a lady. I've been on my knees scrubbing their kitchens, chained to a ring in the floor! How can I stand in front of them now? Aw, you just don't understand. You're a gentleman, born to the silver. I'm a bastard! A rich man's bastard! I don't believe you. On cromwell's grave. You don't believe me? All right. There's only one way I know for a man to prove his credentials. Aah! They'll hear US all over the hill! Let them hear US in Sydney! Are you listening, governor? Look alive, lord croyden, the lags are on the loose! They've worked their tails off for a year or more. Now it's time to play... A game of tag. Winner gets the prize. Oh! Come here. Ha ha ha! Come here! Ooh, you're going to get it. Oh! Gotcha! Oh, we'll break the bed, luv. We'll make a new one. I'm dizzy. There's 3 of you. As if one weren't enough. She's still looking at US. Let her find her own man. I've got mine. [Playing marching music] Welcome, governor. You've done it, beecher. It's even better than I expected. We both might get a pardon out of this. Lord croydon, may I present Mr. and Mrs. Adam beecher? Beecher's the man I told you about. Delighted. And this is sir Edward Barrett, chief magistrate. We've met before, sir. Mrs. Beecher. [Band plays] We are what we are, Bess. You said it-- horses on parade. Notice none of them are venturing too close to the show ring? It's the manure. Adam. Has he said anything, the governor? Now, why would you be worrying about my pardon? Oh, you won't have that chain of yours around my neck anymore. You'll have to watch yourself then, won't you, woman, if you want to keep your fiddle-footed yank home? There's other ways to handle to you, me bucko. Even an old bird can't keep his wings stilled when a charming lady's about. Excuse me, Alex. Yes, sir. Will he get it, sir? The pardon? Oh, I know I shouldn't ask, but all this will mean nothing to him if he can't be free. Now, you're not to worry, lass. [Music stops] [Applause] [Music plays] Thank you, Mrs. Beecher. Thank you, sir. Come on, woman. Oh, no. It's my turn, yank. You're a lucky man, beecher. I hope so, sir. Yes. I think we've let sir Edward harangue the poor commissioner long enough, don't you? So if you'll excuse me... Of course this scheme of sir Philip's would be a constant and a growing burden on her majesty's treasury. That's debatable. Excuse me, sir Edward. I'd like a few words with the commissioner. Alone, if you please, sir Edward. [Applause] We're in for a dandy brawl before we Bury our tin soldiers, gentlemen, with him sucking up to the crown now. A dream, of course, but fascinating-- kilmorin 5 years from now. Morgan did it-- our convict architect. But the vision behind it was Adam beecher's. We might just transport that rascal the other way around. We could use him in London. Sir, I'd like a pardon for beecher. Of course you would. So would I, if I were an incurable romantic. Oh, perhaps in 5 years. 5 years? That boy's under sentence for a crime he didn't commit, but he still worked like an ox to build kilmorin. To begin kilmorin. Be a realist, sir. We need him here to finish the job he started so brilliantly. It'll be a feather in our caps. You'd ride his back to a cabinet post but deny him his freedom. He'll jump the next ship to america if we were foolish enough to give him a pardon. You're wrong. I know this man. He's tried to escape twice. From all I hear, he despises this colony. That was before kilmorin. There's nothing in this world that would tear him away from it now... Except perhaps the incredible stupidity of her majesty's commissioner of inquiry! Ahh. Just admiring your vision, beecher. Most impressive. Excuse me, will you? He turned me down, didn't he? Go ahead, sir. Tell me. It, um... It will take a little longer. That's all. No, don't lie to me. I'm not lying to you. Give me time, Adam. I promise you-- no, you already promised me. Remember, we shook hands on it? "I'll move heaven and earth," you said. Well, you moved them... And where am I now? All I wanted was to dance with her! Airs and graces from a lag bitch I used to have chained up in my kitchen! Bess: Adam, darlin', don't! Aah! Yank! That's enough. And where would you be off to at dawn? None of your damn business, is it? Aw, now, yank, we're sensible men. Surely we can discuss this without losing our heads. Did I rough you, mate? Here. Let me help you up. Ah, enough of that now. Now, why do you make me go and do that? Come on. We'll be getting home-- ugh! Oh, that was a raw one, yank. I--i think you've loosened me favorite tooth. Let me go, damn it! What does it matter to you? It matters to her, your wife. What the hell you running away for? You have it all right here. A bloody paradise! And a woman the likes of which you'll never find again. Not in Boston or timbuktu or wherever you're going! You're after her yourself, aren't you? What? You. You're in love with Bess, and you have been all along. I know, but she's not for me! It's Dyson! He's riding on kilmorin today! She came to warn US. Tell them, girl. Millie, who's with them? Jagger Burke's men and--and the Stratton bunch from up kangaroo valley. We made a fool of him. He won't forget it. We'll need a central defense point. Town hall. Everything into kilmorin-- horses, cattle, sheep, women, and kids! Bess, warn Morgan, nobby, the whole south end of the valley! Yank... Come on! [Pounding] All right. You get it now? I want all the wagons inside the town within the hour. What about the horses? Take them into the bush and tie them up. Take some men with you. Come on, lads. 1...2...heave! Put some of those in there. Two of you, come with me. Over there, Bess. [Gunshots] Some of you men, come up here! [Gunshots] Everyone in the town hall! Get in there! Hurry up! Get in there! Get in there! Get that bloody door down! Come on! Hurry up! Let's go! Hurry up! Everyone, out! Hurry up. Everyone, out. [Shouting] The horses! Hyah! Adam! We got the bodies ready for the burying. Penned up as many animals as we could find. We'll search the brush along the river in the morning. We'll make it better than it was before. They trusted me... Believed everything I told them. All dead and gone... Quietly, so that they won't disturb our sleep tonight. Adam. You love me, I love you. Isn't it a lovely world? You couldn't even wait till morning, could you? Had to clamp your chains back on with your sheep, pigs, and whatever else you got in that damn wagon. And next you'll be whispering about a baby coming. And won't that be a lovely song to sing together at the close of day? A man's nothing without his freedom! I know that! You're just like that old bastard general! You'd like to lock me up here forever! His lies about a pardon, your fairy tale about love! Well, to hell with you both! I'll make my own life! Adam, take me with you! Adam, no! You got your bloody land. No. You'll not want for company. O'shea will look in on you, make sure your sheep increase and your spuds keep growing at night. And, who knows, he might just join you for that lullaby. Oh, Adam, no! They caught him. On his way to the docks. Serves him right. He's in darlinghurst. You know what that means. Come on. Get on there. You can't hang him now, sir. After what he's done for you, you can't. You'd be a bloody murderer. Don't worry, lass. It's Dyson who will hang, not Adam. I've done what I should've that night in kilmorin-- given him his full pardon. I'd like to see him. He headed back to the docks, lass. I wish I could offer you some words of comfort, lass, but I'm rather at a loss myself. I know it was only a dream, but I hoped that Adam might be able to carry on for me at kilmorin now that I won't be here. You not here, sir? No, sergeant. I've been dismissed. Oh, but, sir, without you-- without me you'll probably be a damn sight better off. Aye. Back to whips and chains. Not after I get to London and have my say. Is there anything that I can do? No, sir. Nothing. Ugh. You never did choose the right place to build that bloody hut. Didn't it occur to you the stream could rise in a wet year? If you knew so damn much, why didn't you say something when we first got here? Fat chance I'd had being heard with you shouting orders at me all the time. If I hadn't, you'd still be bloody well lying down there under that tree... Twiddling your toes.
