Mr Vanden Stock, I have great admiration for you as a businessman. Anderlecht is on the up, with fantastic players such as, um... Yes, well, that may be going too far. Mr Vanden Stock. Or may I call you Constant? Right. Constant, don't you also think it's high time that you and I have a talk? Hey, will you get off my pitch? - Sorry. Max De Keukeleire, I specialise in cups. So do I. Unusual, eh? - So are you. Have you come to look at the Anderlecht strikers again? No, I sell cups. Next. - Yes, may I? Mr Chairman. May I call you Constant? Now we're alone. Not much chance of a cup this year, I suppose? Load of big-heads! Hello, Kurt. How's things? Get on with it, Gilbert. DE KEUKELEIRE SPORTS TROPHIES ABSENT DUE TO ABSENCE Carlos. Hello Willy. - Hello Max. Damn. Sofie. - Hi Dad. Hi Granddad. Well, did you get good marks for your test? Probably. - Fantastic. Well done, Sofie. Well? Sold? - There's a good chance it is. No again, then? - The sale was almost complete. You couldn't sell a lifebelt to a drowning man. I've made a shopping list. - Well done, Dad. Let her catch her breath. You don't know what a Religious Knowledge test is like. I've got to go. - Me too. Where to? - Music school. Again? - Yes, flute lessons. You went yesterday. It's only once a week. D'you know about flutes? Shut up, then. You think you can learn to play with only one lesson a week. See you later, Dad. Bye, Granddad. Bye. I checked that pile of rubbish you call your accounts. Van Himst went to the Vanden Stock stadium today to find out about the physical conditions... Sorry, Dad. I'm late. Have you come to look at the strikers? - No, I sell cups. Max. CARLOS DANCING ACADEMY Nice, eh? 85,000 francs. The price they charge for a pinafore dress... Hello. Good news, Max. We've found you a dancing partner. Really? That's a load off my mind. Believe it or not, I was starting to despair. She can dance, can't she? I mean, she is... - You mean supple? You should see her. Legs made from elastic. True, eh? And stamina. Breath for ten. - When can I see her? She's here. - Now? Turn round. Come on. That's enough. She can do a lot more than dance. Sew, hoover, wash, coo... Hello Carlos. Hello Carlos. - Ladies, gentlemen, shall we? Hello Carlos. You aren't cross with me? - Why? You meant well. Definitely. We wanted to cheer you up. Because still not having a dancing partner after seven months... Good thing that people can laugh about it. Dancing partners aren't thick on the ground. And if they are thick, they can't dance. Get it? That was lucky. Can you stop moaning and groaning? You sound like you're giving birth. - Can't we stop for a bit? Stop? Did I stop while I was giving birth? Don't skip, Max. Drag. - There's no point without a partner. I might as well stop the lessons. - Stop, Max? You? My star dancer, my Fred Astaire? No humps. Be proud of your body. - Carlos wants us to go? Yes, we're his prize heifers, his dream team. Who says Carlos will send us? Carlos, because we're his Ginger and Fred, he said. Fred and Wilma, more like it. - Gilbert... Championship. Me? - If you had a partner, right away. And not because you're the landlord's son. But I can only send one couple. And a couple consists of two dancers. Carlos will give us private lessons. - Can we afford them? Don't be so feeble. Be daring. Hasn't Carlos set any conditions for taking part? Taking part in the costs, for example? - Gilbert, shut up and dance. So, if I find a dancing partner, then... Absolutely. But finding and training one in a week, getting her ready for the championship... Wait another year. Take another 50 lessons and next year they'll be begging to be allowed to dance with you. Your half an hour is up, Max. Go on. I must find one. No, Mr De Keukeleire. I can't see a dancer for you. Maybe the cards are wrong. - These cards are 1,000 years old. Then maybe it's time to try a new game. I've been saying every week for seven months that you won't find a dancer. I've found six. - Got through six. That's not fair. - What about the blonde and her arm? I lost my sense of direction and that glass door was in the way. What about the others? Torn Achilles tendon, broken nose. Yes, I... I don't know what goes wrong. Since my wife Jasmine's been gone, I have trouble with women. Minneke, Minneke. - You've got your own business, a wonderful daughter, your father's house. Why tempt fate? Forget about dancing. You won't find a woman. Give generously for the national debt. Give generously. Give generously. Will you leave my wife alone? She winked. - She winked. Yeah, right! What are your sins, my son? - What have you got? Pride, avarice, impurity, gluttony, miserliness. I see women everywhere. Beautiful women, slim, supple. I know, my son. In shop windows, on pavements, on stalls, in stables, in doorways. In cars, at bus stops, in the post office. Don't talk to me about it. They are everywhere, my son. Don't any of them want to dance with me? - Dance? Everyone has his cross to bear. Everyone? - I do too. My communion cup has gone. Where am I going to find another one before evening mass? Have you got a minute? Fantastic cup, eh? This decoration, are those balls? Thick hosts. Well cooked. Been used a lot, eh? Yes, but an antique without dents is like mass without a communion cup. Fine. Mustn't look a gift horse in the mouth. Yes, but... - Your offering is gratefully accepted. Offering? That cup costs 5,000 f... God will reward you, my son. The priest phoned. Yes, he wanted to thank me. - Did he? Thanking is his job. ""Thank the Lord, thank fellow man, thank the missio..."" Have you gone mad? Are you giving cups away now? It's for a company in difficulty and you can deduct it from tax. - From tax! You don't earn anything! Hello. - Hello. Granddad. - Sofie. And another thing. Is it normal for a flute lesson to last 3 hours? No idea. - D'you have any idea about anything? You should pay more attention to where your daughter is. Are you a father or not? Sofie. I'm your father, so I'm entitled to know where you were. Of course you're entitled to, Dad. There. Good night, Granddad. - Good night. See you tomorrow. If there's an accident, it'll be your fault. Haven't you got any eyes in your head? Your daughter's got a boyfriend. - No, she hasn't. She's only 16. In the Congo they had three children by then. You have to make sure no accidents happen, especially now. Put it on. Put it on? D'you mean my daughter rides around with some boy without a helmet? Give her some condoms! - Condoms? Put a packet on your shopping list. - Condoms? Or do you want her to do it without any? Sofie, I want to know now... - Dad! What you want to eat tomorrow. A couple of fried eggs, or what? - Dad, don't take the mickey. Go away. Burglars. Damn, the key. Go away, Kurt. - Mr De Keukeleire. Nice to see you. Go away. I'm so lonely without you Even when the orchestra plays Because dancing will soon bore me Carlos, your key, quickly. Have you been given a role in the nativity play? What, as a stable lad? The key. She's in the hall. Calm down, Max. That's not possible, there's no one in the hall. There is, the dancing partner of my dreams. The championship. Our problems are over. Come on. Mr De Keukeleire, nice to see you. - Carlos? Dancing partner, championship. Is there something I don't know? Clarisse, the hall is closed and there are only two keys. Max's father has got one and I've got one. I saw her wandering around. - You're the one that's wandering. She was wearing a black leotard. - Really? Look. Look. There. She can't have gone. The attic has been empty for years. - The light came from up there. Let him, Carlos. Then he'll know for certain. It won't hurt. Wait. Wait. There's no point. Gone. Gone. You've lost it, Max. Clarisse. - I was standing here on the bin bags. Next time you stand next to the rubbish, let them take you with it. They wouldn't take you with them. They don't pay the men enough for that. Tango tart. Bossa nova bimbo. Dancing bear. Damn it, Annie. We agreed, not in the dance hall. I'm cooped up in the attic. I need to be able to dance. You have to get out of here. - Of course. I'm not staying in this dump for ever. Just a few more days. That's too risky. Until I know Harry's not looking for me anymore, Charlie. And don't call me Charlie. I'm called Carlos here. Mr Carlos. I don't want them to see you here. You can't keep quiet. Worried about your reputation? - You can't stay here. No? What d'you think will happen to your reputation when your pupils hear what sort of dance teacher you really are. Annie, don't push it. Shake it, girls. Chest out, girls. The customers want value for money. Yes, Charlie. Not too fast with those stockings. No, Charlie. Why here? You've got hundreds of other addresses. Because with you a girl is 100% certain that your hands won't wander. Would you rather have chocolate spread? He's not doing it on purpose. He's nervous about the championship. The dancing-with-a-hat stand championship. Hasn't even got a partner. If he's just going to make himself look stupid, he might as well stop dancing. I think I'll sell that dance hall. Dancing is his only pleasure, Granddad. Profit before pleasure. He should be selling cups. De Keukeleires are winners. - Give him one more chance. He's been at it for so long. Child, I've been at him for so long. Here, darling. Jam. - We'll see. I've got to go to the bank. Don't forget the shopping. Right. And there'll be some work done today. - Yes, Dad, you can count on me, Dad. I defended your dancing, Dad. - That's very sweet of you. Dancing is a very important. - Very important. You'd never stop me dancing, eh? - Of course not. You're fantastic. Because next Saturday there's a Mega Dance Party at the Carré. Thanks. - But... Sofie. Sofie! CONDOMS Maniac. Sorry, I haven't got much. Well? Seen any more wandering dancers? - Hello Clarisse. Janine, how much is this? - No idea. Mr Voet, checkout 1 . - Don't bother. I've got enough at home. It's no bother. Eugéne? The red ones, extra large, how much are they? Pardon? - Extra large, strawberry flavour. How much are they? - Are those condoms? Yes, for this gentleman. Six or twelve? - Twenty-four. 540, I think. - 540? Right. It's for a consumer magazine. Gone. ABSENT DUE TO SUPERMARKET Max. Come here. From now on the shop is open everyday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., OK? Yes, Dad. Eight days a week, Dad. You can count on me, Dad. Thanks, Dad. Bye, Dad. I'm going to stay here and sort out your books. Max, what's the matter? Say something. What's happened? - My... my knee. That's what comes of all that dancing. I'll get a doctor. No, Dad. The shops, the customers. I've got selling to do, it'll be OK. No, don't get up, don't get up. I'll get some ice. NIGHTCLUB OWNER WRECKS GIRLFRIEND'S FLAT Shall we play hide and seek? ABSENT DUE TO SERIOUS KNEE INJURY Don't you just want to box his ears? So I was imagining things yesterday? It can happen to anyone. Especially in your condition. My condition? You mean legless? In the gutter? With the rubbish? Clarisse can be rather crude. But there, with her upbringing. But admit it, Max, a dancer who wanders through the window wearing a black top? Look, something's wandered past again. I know what you're going to say, Max. Yes, there's a dancer and yes... I lied to you, but for your own good. To stop you from being disappointed. - You've asked her? As soon as I saw her. What did you think? You know how much I want you to be in the championship. But if she doesn't want to... - She doesn't know me. She's only staying one day. And if I ask her to stay longer? - It's hopeless. I went down on my bended knees. She doesn't want to have anything more to do with men. Luckily for you because Annie Broca can't be trusted. Worse still, she tells lies. About her past and especially about others'. She's no good and doesn't want to. - Thanks, I'll ask her myself. Mr De Keukeleire, nice to see you. - There's something on your ear. No, that's my earring. - An earring? Oh no! Harry! It's Max. Could you tell me something? Have you got time on Sunday to become tango champion with me? Have you been in here? - Yes. How did you know? Pleased to meet you... Is that Sofie? I don't believe it... And without a helmet. Stop. Follow that motorbike. Hey! Damn it. Stop! I'll bring it back, without a scratch on it. Three years later I was in Leopoldville and had 24 blacks working under me. And a driver. And when I met your mother here in '48 her parents' medal shop was no bigger than a market stall. And I turned it into the cup shop. I worked eight days a week. Day and night. Yes, your old dad has made something of this place. One fine day it'll all be yours. And later on, Sofie's. But if you continue to act the buffoon, there won't be anything left for Sofie. So I've made a decision. Leaving you to run the cup shop was a mistake. You're worthless, you're hopeless and you're useless. So I'm taking over again from now on. All you're going to do is serve the customers. And finally be a father to Sofie. And if that messing around with dancing goes on much longer I'll sell the hall. I've had an offer from a body-building club. Carlos wants to send me to the championship. What are you going to dance with? A hat stand? No, I've spoken to a dancer. - A real one? Can she talk? - Yes. Did she say yes? - There's a good chance she will. Oh lad, you can't teach an old dog new tricks. Dad... Right... Was that you on that moped this afternoon? I always walk to flute lessons. I'd forgotten that. A good father doesn't forget things like that. Has Granddad been on at you again? Don't take any notice, Dad. Who listens to their father? When I say no, I mean no. Harry. How... - How did I find you? How does a homing pigeon find its nest? How does a bee find its flower? Animal magnetism. - How did you find me? I've got my connections. Carlos. I'll stuff his phone down his throat. You shouldn't have. Give me that big brown vase. I'll get it myself. I said I wanted to be on my own. - Correction. You said you wanted to be on your own for a couple of days, to think about us. But where do I have to come and look for you two weeks later? In Belgium. A country with more pigs than people. With more ministers than trees. With more Dutchmen than in Holland. The country of the smurfs. It's over, Harry. We're a couple. Harry and Annie. Annie and Harry. D'you think so? I'm a romantic. Even the thought that there could be someone else... makes me... passionate. I've thought about it. You and me, we're going to be a brilliant couple, Marc. Excuse me, it's not Marc. It's Max. But if you want to call me Marc, that's OK. Max, put the record on at the beginning again. Have you gone mad? Get out of my dance class. It's your fault Harry is here. I'm staying for your dance class. Or shall be we turn it into a stripping class, Charlie? Please, don't make a scene. I can explain. Carlos, who's that and where has she come from? It's a sparring partner for Max. Otherwise l'd have to dance with him and I want to concentrate on my prize heifers this evening. Gilbert. Gilbert! She's not that dear, or that good. We'll talk about it later. I thought you'd change your mind from the way you closed the door. Every cloud has a plastic lining. - That's it for today. Remember, the clock's ticking, decision time is approaching. Sorry if it was a bit awkward but I usually dance with a hat stand. Now I know what it feels like. Thanks. - She's certainly no competition. Who for? It'll be better tomorrow. - We'll see. l've got to go. Congratulations. That was quick. Ordered this morning and a partner found by this evening. No, this one is just temporary. Until I find another one, one who is worthy of your son's talent. I'm not saying that because you're the landlord. Time is running out. Let's keep this one. No, this one is too expensive. She's really a ballet dancer. He's been at it for so long. It's OK if it costs a bit more. I'm not in, Harry. - Annie, it's Carlos. I'm not in, Carlos. It wasn't my fault. Harry phoned everyone he knew. I wanted to keep quiet but he could hear from my breathing that you were here. So don't breath anymore. And make everyone happy. Annie, you don't mean that. Say what you've come to say and then get lost. About your plan to dance with Max. - It's ridiculous, of course. But I couldn't think of anything else at the time. Harry was right there. My train's leaving in 45 minutes. Where to? - As far as my money will take me. That's not far enough for Harry. You know that too. Listen, Annie, I've got a suggestion. It'd be good for the dancing academy if you stayed one more week to dance with Max. - Why should I? You used to want to go to Argentina, didn't you? The country of the tango, all your Spanish lessons, Argentinean food. Harry will never find you in Argentina. Argentina... I can't stay here with Harry after me. You don't have to stay until the championship. Just a few days. You join in the dancing, act the wilting weed and twist your ankle or something. Ticket to Argentina? And you've got the money for that? I've got a sponsor. With some silicone you can drink wine out of it again on Sunday. I'm counting on it. - Yes. People are never satisfied. Your order is ready. There. What is that? - You won't find a nicer one anywhere. For a basketball tournament? - Basketball... No problem. There. - You're crazy, man. What do you mean, crazy? People are never satisfied. Two dogs. One bone. That's one dog too many. Shall I wrap them separately? Dance as if your life depends on it, because I'm watching with eagle eyes. At our next practice I'll tell you who's going to the championship Sunday. Put your eyes back in their sockets. Max, it was better with the hat stand, eh? She's got no sense of rhythm. A bit less wild, Annie. Been practising a new throw, Max? If he goes to the championship, I know nothing about wrestling. Stop, stop, stop. Max, there's as much life in this as in a sack of cement. It was going OK, wasn't it Carlos? - Perfect. Annie, why are you stopping? Everything was going so well. Is your old foot injury playing up? - I can't feel what his body wants. Don't worry about that. - Am I counting wrongly? You are counting so hard you're not listening to the music or my body. It's like dancing with a drilled budgie. In Argentina they dance the tango with their stomach and everything below that. The head is excess baggage. - For those two it is. Look at me, Max. Tango, that is hunting. Seducing. You want that woman and you weave your web around her. You pull and she writhes and threshes. You pull closer and closer. Give her some space. Can you feel the warm body of your prey? Can you feel the tension? - Yes. But you don't touch her. - No. Tango comes from the stomach. Seduction. You know what that is. - Yes. Should you go on dancing with that foot? - Is something wrong with your feet? People have got under them too often. Out of the way. You're in the way. Come on. What is this? - A Honda Scooter 75, Dad. No, that Kurt. Don't change the subject. I had a puncture and Kurt brought me home. That Kurt's not your boyfr... - My boyfriend. So what? That boy's got an earring. ln his ear. And I've got two. Hello, Mr De Keukeleire, everything OK, Mr Keukeleire? Nice to see you, Mr De Keukeleire. Can I help you, Mr De Keukeleire? I'll just charm your daughter, Mr De Keukeleire. Impolite lout. Well, he asked me very politely to go to the nightclub. Then say no very politely. - But Dad... You don't jump out of an airplane just because you've got a lifejacket. But it's his birthday. - Happy Birthday. Here's my daughter. Shall I wrap her up? Sometimes you are unbearable. I don't want to hear any more about it. You don't walk into a wall because you've got some aspirin, do you? Then Clarisse will be proved right. - Clarisse? Why Clarisse? She said to Kurt, "I'd rather you didn't go out with that Sofie". "Because in the De Keukeleires there's nothing but offal and guts." Dad! I'll give that tango tart a sound mix that'll blow up her speakers. Gilbert, don't stand there like that, give me a drawing pin. Hello. Clarisse. Do you still dare to come into such a prehistoric hovel? Offal and guts? Eat your words! - You call us cave-dwelling riff-raff. I didn't say that, but I feel like saying it. Maybe... - Will you shut up? I don't trust Kurt, with his earring. In his ear. He's a macho, like you. And your Sofie is hot stuff, not at all like you. Maybe... - Gilbert, will you be quiet! And another thing, if my Kurt wants to go out, he goes out. Oh yeah? lf my Sofie wants to go to a nightclub, you can't stop her. Maybe the children... - Gilbert, shut up! Take another year of private lessons. A special offer. You promised. - You can go next year. You'll be hearing from me, you con man. After that unfortunate incident it is now the moment we have been working towards. I've put off my decision until the last moment. You also know why. - To milk everyone dry? I want everyone to be at their best, not just the couple that's selected. And whoever that couple is, I hope that everyone will be sporting enough to go and cheer them on. I won't keep you in suspense any longer. Clarisse and Gilbert Bal. What did I say? - I'm sure everyone agrees. They are a stylish couple who will be fantastic. Who will be fantastic... ... as reserves, should something unforeseen happen to Annie and Max. Sorry, but I've got to rush off. - Reserves? Fred and Ginger on the bench? That's not on, it's not fair. Carlos? We mustn't forget to cancel the supporters' coach. One word to our supporters and I'll rip out your tongue. It's always the same. You were born a reserve, married as a reserve and you'll die as a reserve. And don't contradict me. We'll see who's a reserve. Let's have a drink to celebrate. - Wouldn't it be better to practice? Aggressive moron. So, I'm an aggressive moron? I meant that in the positive sense of the word. If you want, we'll fight for her. - Who? How? You and me, man against man. With knuckledusters. The winner gets Annie. Annie? You think that I... I don't want Annie. Only as a dancing partner, not as a woman. Come on. Isn't Annie good enough for you? Of course she is. Very good. Isn't she beautiful enough for sir? - Very beautiful, definitely. Not seductive? - Very seductive. So you do? - Yes. D'you know, Cupman, I'm a romantic. Can you keep it up? - It's starting to get heavy. I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to the donkey. Someone's run off with our donkey. My donkey. Stop him. The animal hasn't eaten yet. Go away, go back to your stable. Go away, back to your stable. Go away. Come on. Quickly, over here. Giddy-up. Mr Gaspard. Emma, the things people throw away these days, eh? Did you see that car? - Yes. Outrageous, eh? - Parking problems are getting bad. You don't get that with donkeys. No. And a donkey won't get a flat tyre. You won't embarrass me at that championship, eh? You haven't seen Annie dancing. I'll bring her home this evening. You know what I think of dancers. - Yes. Carne asada a la tampiqueña, Argentinean speciality. That looks delicious, eh Granddad? - Delicious. Delicious... ly hot. Thank you. Success. Here's to winning. Winning isn't important. It's taking part that counts. You're still young. - Young and beautiful, eh Dad? Beauty is on the inside, Sofie. Ever seen a liver operation? No. - I have. In a field hospital. Beauty isn't on the inside. - Granddad... Have you been doing that long, the cups? - I was born in a cup. The taxi was late. Or I'd have been born in a car and might work in a garage now. What do you do, miss? - Call me Annie. I'm never anywhere long enough to have a profession. I'm still looking for myself. - That's like me. Dad always has to look for me, eh? - Does looking for yourself make money? Not everything you do has to make money. The woman doesn't always have to put food on the table. That's the man's role. And what's the woman's role in your opinion? They're forecasting snow on the radio. Well, not on the radio... The only important role for women is the kitchen role. You're forgetting the bread roll. - And a roll in the hay. And the toilet roll. I hope your role will be restricted to dancing. Anyone want some more carne asada? - I don't like meatballs. You haven't even tried them. - But I've still had enough of them. Anyone want some pepper? Clarisse can't stop my daughter doing something. You're wonderful, Dad. Yes, but be home by midnight. Remember, it's not because you've got a fly swat that you open the windows wide. What d'you think of my dress? You're not wearing that? - I've got one like that. It's nice material. Good quality. - You can do the rest yourself, eh? Come on, Sofie, I'll help you get dressed. I haven't been allowed to do that since she was five. Wow. Why do women wear make-up, in fact? Because men can't see straight, so we emphasise a few things. Did you wear make-up on your first date? - No, I don't think so... Yes, I did. I can't remember. - Did anything happen? Of course something happened. I had a great time. And you'll have a great time too. It's sometimes difficult to refuse when a boy asks something. Which is why we start with lipstick. Because then your mouth is more beautiful when... you say no. No. No. Let's start. Doctor, scalpel. No. - No. Yes. No. Good evening, Mr De Keukeleire. Nice to see you. Who did you expect to see? Is Sofie ready? - Ready for what? You know, don't you? - Not everything. Listen, Kurt, I'm her father, don't forget that. Taking my daughter out doesn't mean you can have a good time. No, no, of course not, Mr De Keukeleire. And your results at school? - Sorry? All fails? - No, Mr De Keukeleire. 8 1/2 average. Just passed then. No. - What's the matter with your eyes? Hello, Kurt. Bye, Dad. See you later. Well... - Come on, you need some fresh air. A stupid mistake, De Keukeleire. And an expensive one. It's a long time since I've seen Dad so cross. The last time was yesterday afternoon. Well. Thanks for the lovely evening, Annie. Is that all? And for the meatballs in tomato sauce. Max. Would you come and see whether Harry is there? Would he dare to come back? Well, this used to be my room. Then all the toys are yours? - Yes. I acted out all the train disasters with this. A children's Bible. - No, that was my first reading book. Stories about Gee Sus. Gee Sus healed the blind, Gee Sus walked on water. Jesus! Look. - Sitting Bull. I was Sitting Bull. Brigitte Bardot. Come on, show me. - That was for her diction. Admit it, all little boys were in love with Brigitte Bardot. No, l've only been in love once, with my wife Minneke. Divorced? No, she fell off the ladder and died while painting the gutter. How? - With a brush. And since then? - No one. And you? I always fall for the wrong guy. Half past eight. They'll be inside by now. Who? - Sofie and the earring. You're not going to spy on your daughter? Of course not. Just go and see what she's doing. They're doing some building work. - That's house, Max. Yes, building work to the house. - Good evening. It's full up. Wait until someone comes out. - We were together. Out with your father? - He's performing here. Benny. Those two don't have to pay to get in. He's the star turn. Dad gave me some condoms. - Does he know you're here with Kurt? Yes, Dad trusts me. - Yeah, right. I'm allowed out on my own now. He thinks l'm grown-up enough. Oh no! Shall we go and ask him? I'm late. I'm Double D Dance. - It's full up. Join the queue. I'm the star turn. - Who's the other guy then? Come with me. I was right. They're long gone. There he is. Let's see what you can do. - What do you mean? And now the first turn of the evening, Double D Dance. He's gone. I can't see him anymore. - You're the only one who can't. Good evening in Carré. And now for some good vibes with a great number. I love you, people. OK. Clap your hands. All do the rock. I want to emigrate. OK, I'll do the dance now. Hey, I'm the real one! Sofie, you fibber. You said your dad sold cups. Your dad's amazing. I don't have a dad. I'm an orphan. Leave me alone. Hey, stay here. That was incredible. - Did you see that? Stay here. - Leave me alone. I'm his daughter. It's a shame Sofie didn't see that. The man that was the turn was cross. - Yes. You don't think Harry will come back? No, no. Not after how I dealt with him yesterday. I don't get angry easily, but when I do... Then it's Mad Max. - I had to. Harry still thinks I'm in love with you. And he thinks the same about me. - You in love with me? Hasn't he got any eyes in his head? - Just imagine, you in love with me. Where do they get it from? - Yes, the imagination of some people. And Harry means it. He wants me to fight for you. With those big metal things... Earrings. Like that. - You're not going to, are you? No, of course not. Ridiculous. The one time he's allowed out on his own. Don't misunderstand me. I'm not scared or anything. If I were in love, then... But we're not in love. - Right, we're not in love, eh? Eh? You don't mind that I didn't take you to the cinema first, do you? Max, you've got to go home. Sofie hasn't got a key. Then she can wake Dad up. It's late and it's been a long day. You ain't seen nothing yet, Annette. Max, I'm tired. I want to go to bed. Alone. - Alone? Of course. You didn't think I thought you thought things you shouldn't think. Good night, Max. You're a darling. Right, good night. What's going on? Your working clothes? - Take that off. Immediately. Isn't that your job, taking it off? - I need to eat. Maybe less than you, but still. Look at his. A poster from The Pink Mattress. Oh no, The Pink Atlas nightclub. Girls, girls, girls. Not everyone can dance in the Royal Ballet. Not everyone can dance. Was that Max who almost tripped over his trousers? That's none of your business. Think about it. What can you offer a guy like that with your past? Oh, you'll stay quiet about it until one day you slip up. Or an old customer from The Pink Atlas comes into his shop. Or he happens to hear it from someone. D'you think a guy like that can cope with that? D'you think he'd ever get over it? A model mother for Sofie. I've talked to Carlos about it. Flight KLM 61 7, Schiphol-Buenos Aires. Your flight to Amsterdam leaves Deurne at noon tomorrow. But it's the championship tomorrow. - Oh dear, I forgot all about that. How did that get in there? You don't have to ride to Cactusville just because you've got a bicycle pump. Pick it up, Casanova. - Not now. D'you know what time it is? You can't talk your way out of it this time. Pick it up. Go on. No one throws snowballs at Mad Max. Did you put something in my pocket, Sofie? Something strawberry flavoured? - Yes. Something extra large? Something that had found its way into my flute case? I don't know. You know strawberries give me spots. Joke, Dad. It was nice of you to think of it, but I thought you'd need them more than me. What d'you mean? - Nothing happened. The less you give a man, the happier he is. I learnt that from Annie. - Very sensible. Just because you've got some kitchen roll doesn't mean you have to drop eggs on the floor. Do your best. - I'm nervous. Cheer us on. We're going to win. Clarisse. - Hugo! Good luck. - Thank you. Get ready everyone. Clarisse, this is the photographer. From the newspaper? - Gentil Van den Brande. Welcome. - Supporters, it's time to go. Everyone on the coach. - The reserves are ready too. Is Annie still putting her make-up on? - Gilbert. Sorry, but Annie's not coming. D'you think I'll fall for that after that stunt with the inflatable doll? Tell him. - Her mother died. She had to go home. First one of me on my own? She'd never leave without saying anything. It all happened really quickly. She asked me to say sorry. What are you still doing here? You pranksters! And now a photo of the entrants. Hurry up. They want a photo of the two of us. May I, Clarisse? You poor soul. Do you know who Annie is? Max, I used to be a stripper. Do you still want to dance with me? Striptease? As in how to divest a vest? - OK. Just act normally. Ready? Of course she wants to dance with you. Otherwise she won't get her money. What money? - Tell him you're paid by his father. Annie? - Look at each other. Hold it. That was before I knew you. Yesterday you wanted to dump Max for a trip to Argentina. Clarisse, please... - Gilbert, be quiet. A ticket to Argentina, that's how much you mean to her. You know what they call a woman they pay to get round men? Yes, and smile. OK. That wasn't necessary, was it? - Did I ask for your opinion? Annie, you hypocrite. - Sofie. I bare my soul to you and you don't say a thing about you and my dad. Sofie, there isn't anything going on between me and your dad. You're a poor liar. We saw you behind the church. And I didn't hear your lips say no. Haven't you got any change? - No. My dad's always the same. Here you are. - Thank you. You have come for sweets, haven't you? Make sure you're not too late for the competition. Sofie. Idiot. No, Mr De Keukeleire. I can't see a dancer for you. Of course not. They don't come without a sponsor. Paid. Paid to dance with me. l'll never forgive him. The worn-out old war-horse. He was lucky he wasn't home... Now, now. Mr Gaspard meant well. He's got a good heart. And a bad character. You're not one of Dad's paid yes-men, are you? Watch what you're saying, Max. Mrs Emma and I are friends. I don't believe it. He's appears from behind the wallpaper now. Max, I'm your father. And it's my right, yes, my duty... I'm fed up with you spying on me and turning up all over the place. I'll have to start looking under the toilet seat soon! That's enough! I did what I had to do, but I made a mistake about the type of woman. You're worthless, you're hopeless and you're useless. The type of woman who's looking for herself dances in the nude. And if that's the type of woman I want, what are you going to do about it? Wait, Max. Here, the last card. There's another woman. If you can see that in bits of cardboard, you need to go into rehab. There, spades are trumps. Hopefully her plane hasn't left yet. Over my dead body. - That's only one step. Right. - Dad! I'll bring it back without a scratch. - Dad. Come on. That's enough. Christ. Kurt. Follow him. It's his first time. Ladies and gentlemen. VLM flight 103 to Amsterdam is boarding. I should've gone by train. I'm a pilot. Annie. Annie! Kurt. Dad. She hasn't left yet, has she? You've got metal on you, sir. - Metal? You've got metal on you. You've still got metal on you. I haven't got anything. - The earring. It's the earring in his ear. Come here. Max, what are you doing here? - Is this the tango championship? How could we have got it wrong? Must've been an old street map of Dad's. Come on Annie, we're in the wrong place. Come on. Yes, OK. Yes, Annie, come on. Off you get. That was class B of the Argentinean tango championship. And now the moment we've all been waiting for. Good luck. Wait, you're number is crooked. Nice of you to come and support us. It's the least I could do. Come and cheer you on. What a nice child. - Where does she get that from? ...from Tempo dancing school. Finally, representing the Carlos Dancing Academy, Clarisse and Gilbert Bal. There is a correction. Couple four is replaced by Annie Broca and Max De Keukeleire. No. Sorry. That's not right. - It's the wrong couple. Carlos. I said stop, or I'll do someone a mischief. Clarisse, be quiet. - I won't be messed about. Clarisse, be quiet. - I'm going to tell the jury... Clarisse, be quiet! Clarisse, sit down! Sit over there, please. Good, eh? Annie, come with me. - No. Watch it. Don't do it. It's too difficult. That's first rate. What has that grasshopper got that I haven't? Me. Well done. Well done. Well done. That's my son. No one laughs at Mad Max. Well done. Well done. Explo travel agency? I'd like some information about a trip to Argentina. No, don't send me a brochure. It's a surprise for my fiancée. There are different bits in Argentina? The province of Jujuy. D'you... have another bit? Is that further by plane? How long? Just a minute? Oh, you meant you'd go and look. Hepatitis A? An injection? And tetanus. And typhoid. I'll phone you back. Restaurant Argentina? Have you got a table for two for this evening? Thank you. Bye.
