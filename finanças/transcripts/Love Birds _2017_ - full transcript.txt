"DOVES"\NA film by Dover Koshashvili "Your lucky number is 3650" Tamara! Tamara! Tamara! Tamara? I can be whatever you want. I am looking for my wife. I can be your wife. Do you prefer any other? "Your lucky number is 3650" Sorry! Mister! your bouquet. I prefer a chocolate bar... Or a book. Sorry. My pleasure. "Where are you?" "Draw for you?" "You Wrong Number" "Alon?" "Alon, if you ruin this day for me,\Nit will be the last day of our marriage." Where is Tamara? You need glasses. Slap me. I'm not that type. You are its prototype. Today is my wedding anniversary. Congratulations! Good luck. You wet me. - Will you file a complaint with the police?\N- No. Do you want to kick me in the ass? I don't hate women. Give it to me in the ass. I do not want. Give me ass! I do not want. I'm sorry. Impotent! Child! Yet. In the middle, hit in the middle. You took all the dirt out of me. I am an excellent cleaner. - "I'm going home"\N- "Shall I send you a tourist guide?" "You are playing with fire" "I'm relying on you" Please get out of here. Go here. I'm waiting for my wife. My husband doesn't care about me. I'm not a marriage counselor. The apartment weighs me down. Make repairs. I can't plaster the truth. The truth is not my sexual fantasy. Everything is instantaneous and ephemeral. You are tormented by guilt. I am ready to suffer for you. - Get out of here.\N- Use me. Take me. What turns you on? Kiss. I don't kiss. Love. If this were your last kiss what would you like me to do to you? Rice with milk. I don't take off my shoes. You can at least\Ntake off your wedding ring. Leave me. What are you hiding there? This is unpleasant for me. My unfortunate. - Please don't do this.\N- Shh... This is simply not good. IM married. This is a unique offer. You will lose a lot. "You won't get out of my head" "Husband is trying to get close to me" "Abstaining from you is\Nthe same as abstaining from death" "He dreams that I..." "He wants me to cheat on him" "I want a divorce" "Waiting for you at the Herods Hotel, room 3650" "You turned my head" May I enter? I'm thirsty. Are you expecting someone? No. Is Tamara involved in what's going on here? It's clear. You prevent me from concentrating. Don't think about me. Lean into the water. Does your husband know? It would have enlarged his horns. Apparently, your husband is\Na certified cuckold. I cheat on him with women too. And which is better? I change with couples too. I would not be calm if I were your husband. Do you want black? Maybe theoretically. Do you want two black ones? You have a terribly developed imagination. Black will satisfy you? Black won't do anything to me. "You want revenge, you want blood." I want a divorce. Will it satisfy you? Don't know. If you were a man... I shouldn't have given my ass \N to someone else. Depraved! Good afternoon, \Nordered an Israeli breakfast? Moment. - Israeli breakfast?\N- Do you prefer something else? Yes, come in. Enjoy your meal. Write to the account and add 15%. No, I cannot serve you on credit. I rented a room for cash. I hope everything is fresh. I don't have change from two hundred. Return it to me just in case. Thanks a lot. Did they bring me honey in excess of the norm? I brought you... I brought you a portion, as it should be. Is there something wrong with your neck? I am sensitive to aesthetics. It gets stuck in my head,\Nlike a ghost ship in a bottle. Go, go before you lose your fat tip. Don't get close to me. Dont touch me! Leave me, ugly! I want to go home. Do you need help? You are alone? I'm waiting for my wife. Do you want a quartet? It's clear. Take off the towel. I am not a Chippendale. He is shy. I am not a player. Hint me. Standard. Okay, but he doesn't fuck me. Are you bisexual? Not when the lady is around. Ours or yours? I'm leaning towards the trio. We will be happy to pamper you. You're not my type. I'm best when you're happy. You do not love me. I married you, didn't I? He is handsome. Renegade! That's the only way she gets wet. Your scrambled eggs are getting cold. Take your bouquet with you. Enjoy your meal. Get dressed. Tell Tamara the truth. I love Tamara. - You found the right time to state it.\N- I am not a lecher. You suffer from amnesia. You begged me to kick your ass. Be merciful. Find yourself another man. You are lying. I can't tell Tamara\Nthat I was raped. It's better to pretend that everything is okay. You put your hands in my underpants. Now you're pretty determined. You seduced me. Unhappy. Depraved. The most depraved. "Yuval" My daughter. My beauty. Dad, can you pick me up from the ballet? What about Dana's mom?\NIt's her turn this week. Dana gets on my nerves. We all get on our nerves sometimes. Dad, come pick me up from the ballet! Come back with Dana getting on your nerves. Dad, I want you to pick me up\Nto buy a present for mom. Well, make her a beautiful drawing\Nand write a congratulation from the bottom of your heart. Dad, the drawing is already ready. Mom will be happy to receive it. Mom and I bought you a present. You will waste all your money. And I get on my nerves sometimes. What do you want to buy? Dad, if I'd known,\NI'd have gone with Grandma by now. Okay, my dear, how are you? Happy Anniversary! Thank you. Yuvali, what did you buy me? Dad, bye. She twirls me with one little finger. You are a man. What about your husband? A monkey. Can't stand you? He has selective vision. Are you trying to hurt him? I want to feel good. The best. Hellish Illumination. Rebel. The most. What will you have at the end? I'll overcome my depression\Nand run to tell my friends. This is the first and last time. You run away from me every half an hour,\Nand I'm still with you. This is fantasy. I didn't feel that way with other men. Why are you continuing? My psychologist is shocked by me. Here comes Tamara. Tell her she's disturbing your sleep. This is your wife, tell her what you want... Tell her I ran away from here after\Nbegging me to kick your ass. She won't believe me. Help me. I'm not going to start lying for you. Get dressed. I died. And I'm dead. I'm not made up. I prefer to jump into the pool. Let's draw lots. "Hush, mice, the cat is on the roof,\Nand the kittens are even higher." One two Three! One two Three! One two Three! Crap! 3650? Champagne bottle. Courtesy of the \Npublic relations department of the hotel. "Abstaining from you is like \Nrefraining from death." Tamara loves me. Come on, come in, it's already warmed up. Where's she? The hotel management asks you to fuck quietly. We scare off the orthodox. Where are your cigarettes? In a bag. Forget what you saw. It's not for you. At least not for your stage. I thought you didn't smoke. I smoked my last cigarette 3650 days ago. You won't drag me into your paranoia. It was at my wedding. Get out of here before the alarm goes off. This metal is very expensive. Take it for yourself. Is this your wedding ring? I broke the marriage bond\Nand abused the family's trust. I seduced you. Throw me off the balcony. I am a laughing stock. You're too caught up in fantasies. - This is your lover.\N- You are my lover. He is ready to divorce for you. I'm not ready to get divorced yet. Do you smoke. What's this? "You don't get out of my head." "Abstaining from you is \Nlike abstaining from death." This is SMS. Who is it? He sends me SMS. Are you having an affair with him? He sends me SMS. Did he bring a bottle of champagne? I will write to him: thank you very much. Fraudster. Does it help you find the truth? Moment, is he a figment of our imagination? He is much more real than you. He went home. You invaded my privacy. I thought you were different. You don't deserve to be treated well. There are no limits I'm willing to cross\Nfor your imagination. I am not idiot. You ruined my fantasy. Keep in touch after you\Nwash this shit off. Laundered. You ruined our lives. Get undressed. What do you want to get? I will rape you in the bathroom. And I'll dry your things. Dry things. Pss... pss... Brother give it a puff. Bro, you are not a man. He let her out of his hands. I didn't think she would cheat on me. - Does she love me?\N- She cuckolded me. Get used to the horns. Don't hurt her. Are you worried? I forgave her. You have little horns. Don't worry, she'll make them even bigger. Weak calf. Sorry, can i ask for a cigarette? Moment. - Thank you very much.\N- Please. Can I have one more? To health. Thanks a lot. This is the first cigarette. I don't give in to temptation. I quit 10 years ago. We are here at a conference for the development of holy places. Cigarettes - my wife. You are invited to visit. She cuckolded me. Lust raises its head\Neven among great believers. Cheating undermines the most important purpose of life. She can't get enough and she sows despair around her. God obeys the laws of nature. God is not a brute, \N under the control of hormones. Why are you in fancy dress? I will pray for you\Nthat you will be granted the mercy of the Lord. This is my holy place. Drive her away. You defile the honor of the family. Corpses. It fell out of your pants. It is yours. A gift from my grandmother.\NShe asked my mother to give it to you today. You don't give me this ring with all your heart. Now you are humiliating both my grandmother and my mother. - You don't respect me.\N- The ring is from your daughters' grandmother. A stain of shame. Danger sign. I'll wear this ring\Nwhen you put on your wedding ring. Tell her you\Nare not worthy to wear this ring. Did Tamara like the ring? Man, the ring is amazing. Family diamond. It's because I love your son. My mom got it from her mother-in-law\Nfor her 10th wedding anniversary. I am proud to be a member of your family. I thank the Lord that Alon has honored you. I'll content myself with a little gratitude from Alon. Pinchas and I almost missed your decade. Malka caught me\Nwith her best friend. Until now, she makes eyes at him. I hope Alon has inherited your character. I'll get you some matching earrings\Nfor your next wedding anniversary. Pinkhas, I always blush at your words. Happy Anniversary! Thank you. I didn't dry your things for you to leave. I'm sorry. You spit on me. I lean on you. You're exaggerating too much. This is my hobby. You will lose me. It depends on you. Relax. I can forgive you if you stop this. If I could get out of this I wouldn't start. The girls will know. I cannot betray children. You will get used to it. Get away from me. Backward. I want to grow old with you. I don't want a stepfather for girls. There is no man who wants you. - The kids have cornered us.\N- Don't stain the kids with your dirt. They took our lives. - Man, she's right.\N- Go blow the saffron. What? I'm not for you. They destroyed us completely. Man, do you have a cigarette? Give me a puff. This is a non-smoking room. I'll make a steak out of you. Turn around, let's look at your ass. What happened to you? - I'm talking to him.\N- I can hear you. I didn't mean to cheat on you. I do not blame you. I was angry with girls for no reason. Don't stain the girls with your dirt. I hoped that the children would save our marriage. She ran to Champagne\N so as not to injure the children. I hope I didn't overdo it. I am done with my shortcomings. You cheated on me because of the kids. And because of you. You cheated on me because of me and because of the kids. I didn't mess with your enemy. "Sacrificed herself"\N is much better. You will stay with me. Give me the girls and take whatever you want. No court in the world will give you children. Alon? What? Where are you going? Break a bottle on the head of Champagne. You will stun him with your appearance. Happy Anniversary! Congratulations! Congratulations! "Congratulations to Tamara and Alon on their wedding anniversary. Daniella, Noah and Leela." Thank you. They also deserve credit for the suite. Thanks a lot. This is our second bottle today. You've come at a time,\Nthe worst it can be. Alon! Leela. We know. Tamara told you? Noah and Daniella saw me. And Lilah introduced me to him. He is her brother. Do you hate your brother's wife? I love my brother. What did you tell them that I'm frigid? We are ready to tear you to pieces at any moment. My husband will stab me if I propose \Nopen marriage to him. Euroshik. We are in Israel. You can choose any of us. I love Tamara. I recommend Danielle to you. "Champagne" says she's the best. What is your degree? Lilah had her eye on you way before she introduced me to Champagne. Do you have anything else besides Champagne? I am always willing to accept offers. Break up with your wife. Break up with your friends. I am not a pervert. - It's delicious.\N- I don't want to. Break up with Meir. Meir introduced us. Meir cheats on Hagi. I am not Meir's tutor. I am not Leela's tutor. Lilah set you up with Champagne. You pushed Tamara to this. I am not Tamara's boyfriend. I'm made from the same stuff as Meir. Depraved. Speak well of your wife. I'll let her know when a spot becomes available at the company. In the meantime, let her enjoy the privileges \N your friends have. Look at her. She has natural breasts. I don't think. Do we argue? She won't admit that her self-confidence \N is swollen from silicone. You can verify for yourself. Bolder. Find another way to clear your conscience. I'll go down to the lobby with Leela and Noah. Danielle? I need a bed. You can always back out. Ask Leela and Noah to accompany you. Happy Anniversary. Did you do it yourself? Packed. Learn from your grandmother. This is an iPhone docking station. Ask Yuval\Nto buy me a present with grandma. Runs on batteries. Arik Einstein? Aric Lavie. "Was it or wasn't it?" "Will I sing you a song?" Again. "In the gardens"? "Autumn Song" Again. Trust me. There are things that I cannot tell you. So don't do them. Are you kissing Champagne? He is excellent at language. Why don't you kiss me? You want depraved. I am a good girl. Where is your ring? In a swimming pool. I'm... divorced. I don't have swimming trunks. I won't have sex with you. Room service. Hello. Is there a segev? Give me a sec. Segev... Hello? You swim? I hate to dry myself. My ring fell into the pool. Bring it to me, you'll get twice as much. Who is it? Ghost ship. How much did you say the ring cost? One hoop costs 300 shekels. I earn 300 shekels without getting wet. Bring me the ring, you'll get 1000. Bye. I'll dry your clothes. Brother can i have a cigarette? I feel uncomfortable in front of Tamara. I can't tell her. You are torturing her. I'm afraid. You are in the same boat. I am not guilty. You don't love her. This hurts her. She is eaten by wine. She cheated on me. You should confess before she finds out. We are both in the same boat. Tell her and I'll disappear. I'm used to you. Ghost ship. Here comes the bride. I shouldn't have called her. Why are you putting on this whole show? You are destroying yourself and your marriage. This is our last chance to stay together. What are you doing here? I've come to deal with you. Tamara in the bathroom Send her for ice cream. Today is our wedding anniversary. I will hold a candle for you. Did you follow me? You invited me. Number 3650. Bye. I got it from you. She hacked my phone. Unhappy. She knows everything. Happy Anniversary! Go here. Talk to me when you're free. I am always free for you. What do you want? One ordinary. What do you want to hear? What you want. - I love their greatness.\N- Come out. Who was that? Go here. Where is the ring? On fire You can go. A strange package has arrived. From whom? I thought from you. Where's she? In a safe place. Show me. Go here. The most beautiful of all. Here is the package. Lucky. I'm mad at you. This package is yours. Why didn't you tell me? Hoped you would heal. It aggravates. Just ass. Very nice, Merav. I know you. You are confusing me with someone else. Do you recognize? Where did you get it? Do you know him? I took it off. He's waiting for you in the lobby. I don't remember talking to him. He wants you. And I want you. Are you sleeping with him? Of course. Since when? From the 9th grade. This is not what you told me. This is Omer, my husband. Tamara is Leela's best friend. Who is Leela? Omer's sister. Omer, my husband? Omer has 2 brothers. Fraudster. You didn't really cheat on me. Too bad you figured it out so soon. Choose. I refrain. And I refrain. You refuse. Be with me. Take her away. At least try. Take her and get out of here. I don't want to keep lying to you. I will help you. You want me? No. Look at me. You are naked. Touch me. Please call your husband. My husband is in bed with his concubine. All men are crap. Help me. How is she? Sexy. Lead me. This is Merav. Hey Merav. - Feel free.\N- I feel great. What is your name? Segev. You are wet. - Lower your head.\N- All right. You look like a castrato. It's from the cold. I have been in... ...water. How does he feel? I removed my lenses before entering the water. One egg dropped. It took you a long time. We have a big pool. I ignore being late. Where is the ring? - Go get it.\N- The ring! You have it. Maybe it will come back on its own. You are blind. There are 4573 tiles in this pool. - Ring in the pool?\N- In the pool. It's not there. Get out. Tamara! Tamara! Did I hurt you? Feel free. - Help him.\N- Don't touch me. Go. I'm going with Alon. Don't forget to buy me a present from Yuval. Enough. Next time\Nyou'll find me in your bed with Meir. I'm sorry. I understand. I'm serious. Okay, take a break. Its end. We'll talk when you come to your senses. Happy Anniversary! Goodbye. Thank you. My pleasure. Can I have swimming trunks? I don't go without panties. - You got 1000 shekels for it.\N- It's a solid hotel. We need to find the ring. Happy Anniversary! Segev. Thanks a lot. You win. Just whetted my appetite. "What you lose inside, you won't find outside." You do not love me. We are partners. I am not your mother. - You're my wife.\N- That's not enough for me. I do not want to know. I'm not going to start lying to you. - I will resist the truth.\N- Don't touch me. Do not trust him. He creates illusions for you. Alon will continue to cheat on you.\NHe will only get more experienced. You just hurt yourself. Shit stays shit. He will sell his soul for sex. Tamara! Tamara! Tamara! What? We are rich. I found a ring. Take care of him.
