Hurrah for women Hurrah for beautiful women Who are the pillars of love Who are the pillars of love I keep thinking of the words That Don Nicola always said to me "You are too young, you are too naive" "That is the truth" Lulù swore her great love for me That angel face burned my soul But her fireman boyfriend Watered all my flames of love The story of this failure Leaves me very perplexed But if one woman is like that Another 50 say yes to me Hurrah for women Hurrah for beautiful women Who are the pillars of love Who are the pillars of love I keep thinking of Don Nicola There is something to learn from him "You are too simple, you are too shy" "That is the truth" Mimì looked at me, bewitched And said beautiful words to me "You are my light, my life" But then left with the electricity payment man That sad and unhappy experience Led me to being cautious But if one woman is like that Another 200 say yes to me Hurrah for women Hurrah for beautiful women Who are the pillars of love Who are the pillars of love But I keep remembering Don Nicola Who led me by example and with his words "You are too young, you are too sweet" "That is the truth" Nenè spoke to me of love A clear sea without clouds But she didn't know how to swim And boarded a Japanese fleet This other sad adventure Doesn't frighten me anymore Because if one woman is like that All the others say yes to me Hurrah for women Hurrah for beautiful women Who are the pillars of love Who are the pillars of love Here is the bus. Run! -Bye, Dad. Have a good day. -Bye, Simonetta. Go! -Hi. -Hi. -What's he want? He's your friend? -No. Listen… Listen! -Listen! -Forget it. -Dear Franco! -Ciccio, sorry I had you wait. No. I just arrived. There is nothing wrong with waiting. Come. -Please, after you. -No, no! -Good morning to everyone. -Good morning, Marshal. -Two cappuccinos with cold milk. -As usual, Marshal. -Good morning, Sergeant. -Finally I find you alone. You spoke too soon! Good morning, sweet flower of the West. Good morning, Mr. Ikido. May the sun illuminate your eyes and the moon wet them with silver until dawn. You are always so kind. -Will you have the usual Vermouth? -Yes, at the usual table. A Vermouth for Mr. Ikido. Why is he in Italy? He's from the Japanese Navy and works at the Consulate. He comes to consult here? -Are you jealous? -You ask? Miss Nenè, say one word and I'll drop to your feet! -Watch out, Sergeant! -Excuse me, Ciccio. It was a small accident. How much is it? -I'll pay. How much? -The usual 200 liras. -See you tomorrow, Miss Nenè. -See you tomorrow. -Shall we go? -Goodbye, Marshal. -After you. -Please. -Ciccio, you are a marshal! -Rank has nothing to do with it. When you talk like that you make me feel like a marshal. Aren't you exaggerating with your passion for women? You're right, but I can't help it. It's how I am. -Why don't you get married? -One woman isn't enough. Ciccio, I want ten, 20, 30 women! As they say… -Excuse me. -Calm down, alright. I do not agree. He is my teacher. He knows all about free love. -Don Nicola? -He is my guide for women. Let's say hello to him. -Hello, boys. How's it going? -Good morning. Please, sit down. -If Cristina calls, I'm not here. -Alright. Don Nicola, what did you prepare for this evening? -Bone marrow with corn cob. -What is it? Simple, bone marrow. Where there's the hole, there's the cob. -And if a man doesn't want the cob? -He is doubly shrewd. Two portions for me! -Are you eating with us? -No. I'm eating with the crow… With my wife. Don Nicola, don't insist. You know he is married! How can such a young and handsome man… How can such a man as you be tied to a woman? A man must have 1,000 women. He must have a harem! Bravo! "He who speaks of women, speaks of trouble!" -Who is in trouble? -Nobody. You said, "He who speaks of women, speaks of trouble!" -What trouble? -None. What trouble are you talking about? I said, "He who speaks of women, speaks of trouble." -What trouble? -Nobody is in trouble! Sergeant, you didn't understand. Talk to me. What trouble? -Forget it! -Forget the trouble! -He's right! -A man must be free! -As free as a swallow! -Like me! Swallows, cardinal, and sparrow! -What are you doing? -A sparrow. -It's late. We must go. -Alright. -Goodbye, thank you. -Goodbye. Thank you, sir. He is so pleasant! Ciccio, do me a favor. I'd like a permit. -Why do you need it? -My nephew is coming from America. I'm picking him up at the airport. -Blonde or brunette? -It's the truth. He is my sister's son, a successful Italian-American singer. He is coming to Italy for a tour. Will you take care of the permit? -Sergeant Samperi… -Yes, Ciccio? Not "Ciccio." I am marshal La Rosa! -You had said… -Don't call me Ciccio! Inside the station, I want discipline and respect! -But earlier… -That was before. Now is now! -But… -Sergeant Samperi! -Yes, sir! -Your uniform is not in order. -Button up your pocket. -Yes, sir! Sergeant Samperi, go on duty right away. -You are seven minutes late! -Yes, sir! Sergeant Samperi, you won't have the permit because you were to present a written request and a day in advance! -Sergeant Samperi! -Yes, sir! -Attention! -Yes, sir! I'm sorry, Marshal. I won't do it anymore. -Samperi. -What is it, Marshal? -Marshal? -Yes, Colonel. -Are you drunk? -No. He has made me drunk! -I don't understand anything! -Marshal La Rosa? That man has two faces. One outside and one inside. Outside he kisses me and inside he snubs me! In the night a metamorphosis takes place, and he becomes Doctor Jekyll. I am going crazy! It's not… Yes, sir! I'll go right away! Excuse me if I'm still here. Goodbye, sir! Where should I go? Which road should I take? I am here, sir! I'll go right away! -Sergeant Samperi! -Yes, sir! -We are nine minutes late! -I'll go right away! On the tenth minute, 15 days of penalty! Yes, sir! I am going to score the goal! I don't understand anything. Should I go up or down? -I don't know. -I am going crazy. Am I in the military? Then I'll go. Your attention, please. Alitalia announces the arrival of flight 980 from New York. Wait, please. Look at what a spectacle, Tony! We are in Italy and there's no audience applauding you. -Is this the spectacle? -Don't worry! When they hear you sing, we'll have 10,000 people in each airport crying out, "Cheers for Tony Marconi!" -Let's hope so. -Please. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. -Isn't your uncle here? -I don't know him. -He doesn't know you either? -No. Then how can you find him? It won't be difficult. He has an enlisted man's army uniform. Look. Maybe it's him. -It's him! -Let's go say hello to him. Come on, Tony! -Are you Tony Marconi? -Yes, Uncle. -Why do you call me uncle? -You are his mother's brother. No. I am marshal Palombi of the 2nd Internal Company. I have an order to stop Tony Marconi coming from the US. -Why? -Come to the station. I'll explain. Victor, they're arresting me. Don't worry. We'll clarify everything in the station. -Marshal, what did we do? -Well… He is an important singer. We've come from America. As an Italian-American, you were told to choose between two armies. Two years ago in America you signed this statement with which you chose the Italian Army. Yes. I had forgotten. You know, we artists… He tours around the world. It's written here too. -Who are you? -I am his manager, his agent. Victor Santaniello. -Are you Italian? -Originally. ID, please. -I am worried. -About what? We fooled them. My trick worked. -You think? -Yes. I couldn't see. You coughed. They believed it. We won't do our military service. -Are they rejecting us? -Yes! -We fooled them! -We did! You and me Wait, here comes the doctor… Tony Marconi and Victor Santaniello? Yes! You'll enlist. 4th Infantry Regiment. You can go. Right. Company, attention! Left flank! Forward, march! One, two! One, two! Right leg! One, two! One, two! Chest out! You are soldiers, not snails! Forward, march! Forward! March! One, two! One, two! Forward, march! Company, halt! -It's not good. -It's true. -The instructors aren't strict enough. -Right. -This training is insufficient. -It's true. -Marshal, give instructions. -I will increase the discipline. -Right. Marshal La Rosa… -Thank you. The regiment celebration is in 20 days. This year we must do something big. This year we must beat the granatieri. -What did they do? -Don't you remember? Last year their performance received accolades from headquarters. This year we must have payback. Choose the most suited among the soldiers. The chosen ones will be exempt from duty and drills. Within possible limits, Colonel. Discipline comes first. I was forgetting that you are a model non-commissioned officer. I do my duty. -Do you have other orders? -No, thank you. You can go. About-face! About-face! At ease! Company, attention! Right flank! Forward, march! Run! One, two! One, two! Right leg, left leg! Right leg! Left leg! About-face! One, two! One, two! Chest out! One, two! One, two! One, two! Company, halt! Left flank! About-face! Idiot. What are you doing? Excuse me. I got distracted. -Alright. -It is not alright. It is not alright. Silence! -This will cost you a day… -No. -Two days… -No. -Three days… -Yes. Yes, it will cost you three days of detention! Attention! Break the lines. Go. Luckily he left. Or you'd have gone to prison three months. I'm sorry. I must make out a report. Sergeant, help us. Forgive my friend. We are soldiers by mistake. When we got off the plane… -Plane? -Yes, we come from America. -America? -Yes. They took us here and didn't give us time to look for an uncle sergeant that we have in the Italian army. -What is his name? -Samperi. -Sam…? -Yes. My nephew, finally I find you! -Sergeant, he is your nephew. -Him? -Uncle! -Good! This is way better! What a joy! Let's go to the cafe to celebrate! -I wanted to come… -We have a problem. -What? -We have a performance tonight. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo, Tony! Ten, 20, 30, 40 and 50. -Wasn't it 100? -That was for two performances. But since he's military, Tony can only do afternoons, so 50. OK, better than nothing. My compliments. I liked the boy. I'm glad. I was sure of his big success. -He is an okay boy! -Bravo, very talented. I confirm the contract for 15 days. -The ashes. -I can renew it for a month. Thank you, Mrs. Lulù. I won't betray your trust. I hope so. Go back to the pool and go for a swim. I want the public to always be in contact with its heroes. Come to the management office. I want to drink a whiskey with you to celebrate. To celebrate success and friendship. Ashes. -Want a drink? -No. -It is not alcoholic. -No. -Want a smoke? -No. You don't drink, you don't smoke. You're a model of virtue! A big scene. I've a double life. You want to dance? No. I'd rather go for a swim. I'll do that too. -Shall we swim too? -Yes, let's go. -Will you be in Italy long? -I wanted to stay a couple of months. -And then… -Then? A big organization made out a long term contract. -Naturally you accepted. -I was forced. You seem disappointed. Sometimes certain contracts seem like an imposition. -It's already 7:30. It's late! -Late? -I must be at home at 8. -Do you live at a barracks? -Almost. My father is military. -I'll bet he is an officer. Yes, the colonel of the 4th Infantry Regiment. -The 4th Infantry Regiment? -Yes! -What is your name? -Simonetta. -I can accompany you home. -Yes, thanks. Very kind of you. You're welcome. -I'll go change. See you later. -I'll wait for you at the entrance. Alright. She is the colonel's daughter! We'll have the station in our hands. You and me Tony, have her fall in love. Don't worry. She is already making sweet eyes at me. Who is it? Good morning. -You're leaving already? -Unfortunately… What about our whiskey? Let's postpone till tomorrow. Victor will explain. -Your ashes, Donna Lulù. -Don't bore me! Donna Lulù, maybe if he moves, Tony can get by. Maybe we solved our problems. As of tomorrow, smooth as velvet! Do you understand? -Simonetta, you want a ride? -No, thank you. -See you tomorrow. -Bye. Soldier Tony Marconi of the 4th Infantry Regiment. -Who gave you this uniform? -The Italian government. You can get arrested for wearing it. No, I can get arrested if I don't wear it! Nobody knows I'm military, but it's the truth. Taxi! You seem worried. You think I'll ask your father for a recommendation? No, I don't. Good. Recommendations disgust me. Is your boyfriend among your friends? No. We are just school mates, all very fond of one another. In America, the first love is always born in school. Here too, but not for everyone. -Do you like Rome? -I heard that it's very beautiful. I think I will like it. You come from New York. It can be a disappointment for you. In New York I didn't meet any Simonettas. -I am afraid of disappointments. -There won't be disappointments. Wake up, guys! Wake up, angels! Did you hear the trumpet? Wake up, loafers! Wash and dry yourselves in five minutes! Come on! Wake up! I said, "Wake up!" Understand? Wake up! Wake up! Don't look at me. Hurry! Come on, guys! -Wake up! -The Japanese! We're surrounded! We are surrounded! -The war is over. -Really? They didn't tell me. Good morning, Sylva. Good morning, Gina. Good morning, Sophia. Good morning, Marshal. Who is the idiot that put it here? Excuse me. How long does it take to become a sergeant like you? It took me 18 years. How much does it take for a normal person? How can you wake up so early? Rub! Wash yourselves! -Why aren't you washing yourselves? -Because there is no water. There's no water? Impossible! Did you see? Idiots! Thank you, Nenè. I'd like my eyes to become drops of dew to place them on the flower of your beauty. Thank you. Miss Nenè, the consulates are increasing. They are Japanese officers here for a courtesy visit. When they will do us the courtesy of leaving, ray of sun that illuminates the morning with extraordinary beauty? -Sergeant, have you become poetic? -I'm competing with Japan. -Nenè! Nenè! -Yes? Give me an ice-cream too! Snap to it! Don't stop! Move it! Run! Come on! What are you doing there? Agility! Agility! Move it! Snap to it! Come on! Move it! Crawl! Run! Move it! What is going on? Hurry! Go on! Come on! Sergeant, do you want an egg? Go! Come on! Slow pokes! Come on! Good job! Not you! Confined! In line! Come on! Hurry! Run! What did you do? Don't laugh, idiot! In line! What a… Let go! Let go! Everyone stop! Don't break the lines, understand? Marshal La Rosa orders two hours of drills! Left flank! Run! What are you doing in the water? Attention! Run! -It's slippery! -Move it! Especially in the character of Renzo, Manzoni transfers his philosophic and Christian conception, showing us that with the inevitable forces of evil, the search for justice cannot be separated from faith. La Rosa! Repeat what I said. -Simonetta, what's happening? -Nothing. I've a bit of a headache. -Do you want to go out? -Yes, thank you. I had better. Go, dear. In the novel, Don Rodrigo expresses the symbolic expression of evil. The old machine guns were cooled with water, and that is why we were losing wars, today we have cooling with oil baths. What does that mean? It means that the bullets don't heat the machine gun. An oil bath+ is a sort of bain-marie. Why do you want to know? Battalion, attention! -At ease! Why "battalion"? -Company, attention! At ease! Why "company"? -Platoon, attention! -At ease! Why "platoon"? Marshal, what can I say? Sit down! -Silence! -You are nervous. Maybe because of the heat. -Try to be calm. -Yes, sir. -Continue. -May I? -Where were we? -The machine gun in bain-marie. You should go to the prison! So, let's see… What do you think this object is? It could be a spool. No, it's a cylinder pump. What is it for? What is it for? How does it fit? How does it work? If the machine gun is turned over, does it shoot or not? -It shoots! -Does it shoot? I will shoot myself. I am the one who needs to teach them! Excuse me. -Sergeant Samperi. -Yes, sir. You are a mediocre instructor. Why do you have this paper when on duty? -Where is it? -It was in your pocket. I am interested in important news. More important than the recruits' instructions? It's… sentimental news. I see. Is your nephew debuting? The Italian-American singer? Yes. He was very successful. -You want binoculars? -No. I thought you were farsighted. -He is very good. -Yes, he's been very successful. Yes. "Tony Marconi, a breakout star, sends the audience in ecstasy." -My compliments. -Thank you. I've already seen that face. It's not possible. Two days ago he was still in America. Maybe he arrived with… with a parachute. -Be quiet! -Yes, sir! We have a breakout star in the barracks! A singer! -Thank you. -You had three days of confinement. -Who let you out? -My uncle. Who authorized you to participate in the show? My manager, Santaniello. Santaniello is a general of the armed forces? Santaniello! How dare you do something like that, and let my nephew sing? You can't do that in military life! Understand? -Have you finished? -Yes, sir. -Thank you. -Yes. You'll get 15 days of restriction and 30 of confinement. Let's hear what the colonel thinks about this. I'm confiscating the paper. -Attention! -At ease. Attention! At ease. -How are the lessons going? -Very well, Colonel. -Good. How far have you gotten? -Bain-marie. -What? -There are new instructions, oil bath. I am expecting a lot from this school. In these barracks the best men of tomorrow are being formed. Don't disappoint our hopes. Excuse me. I must talk to you about something serious. -Follow me in the office. -Attention! At ease! The lesson is over! Uncle, you must help me or I'll miss the show. You are in trouble. If you go, it'll be 70 days of confinement. You must get me out of the barracks. I just need a half hour. I must see someone. -A woman? -Yes. You are like your uncle! -Help him or we are ruined. -How? The laundry truck! -Have we arrived? -Yes. Remember, no funny business. -In 10 minutes, I'll be back. -Alright. Simonetta! Tony! -What are you doing here? -I ran away from the barracks. Ran away? The marshal confined me for 30 days, plus 15 of restriction. But I… I don't want to take advantage of the colonel's daughter. -I'm sorry, Tony. -I must go now. -When will I see you? -Maybe never. -You must tell your father something. -What? Marshal La Rosa has mistaken the barracks for a concentration camp. He is the most hated non-commissioned officer. -I'll tell him. -Will you promise? -I promise. -Bye. Morning. I am the daughter of marshal La Rosa. May I see him? Yes. Shall I have you accompanied? -No, thanks. I know the way. -As you wish. Tony, what do you think? -I'd remove this piece. -You're right. Yes. -Sergeant, what do you think? -I'd remove that… Kiss me, little one, with your sweet mouth. -I said enough! -Sure. My child, you caused a big mess. I am mortified. I only came for my father. Father? Me or the real one? The real one. I was sorry to hear that criticism. I thought my father was what he is for me, kind, sweet, loving. He always forgave everything I did. That is the real face of your father. Be sure of that. Here in the barracks we all change a bit. Throughout my career, I have been called a witch, a pirate, a dinosaur. Do you think I am all these things? No. Then let's solve this mess. If you want, I can tell Tony the truth. No. It's not necessary right now. The most difficult thing is dealing with marshal La Rosa. You are afraid of my father too. Yes, it's true. He is a tough one. He is a first class military man, upstanding, honest, but with a difficult character. How can I criticize him for that? You're right. I am embarrassing you. I must deal with it myself. Let me think. There must be a solution. If it's true that this boy sings well, he found the solution himself. -Go now. -Thanks. Bye. Come back whenever you want. -Headquarters. -Marshal La Rosa? Come to my office. -Thank you, Simonetta. -For what? -It seems like a dream. -I don't understand. Don't you know what happened this afternoon? No. I didn't manage to talk to my father. -No? -I swear. The colonel called me and said, "Are you the singer Tony Marconi?" I answered, "Yes, sir." He replied, "Very well!" "As of today, you will take care of the regiment celebration." "I authorize you to do your shows, to dress in civilian clothes, and return after midnight." What did you say? I just thanked him, but I almost embraced him. Simonetta, you have a wonderful father. What did the marshal say? La Rosa? He's a scoundrel. He was disappointed. He punished me and took the paper to the colonel. He wanted to put me on trial! That scum! -Can you walk me home? -So early? I don't have a permit until midnight. The director of the club is having a party in my honor. I see. Not going means turning my back and… -I understand. -We artists must do these things. Do what you want. No need to apologize. -Will I see you tomorrow? -If you don't have other plans. Donna Lulù, you are made of a volcanic matter! -You are all lava and lapilli. -It's why I keep you close to me. I need someone to put out my flames. -Am I disturbing? -No. I was waiting for you. -Filippo, can you leave us alone? -As you wish. Who will put out your cigarettes? I won't smoke for a few hours. So many girls! Hello. These are Mimì, Tony and Victor. These are my girlfriends. -Good morning. -Hello. -It's nice. -Know how to drive it? -A bit. -Then drive it. You're driving? Remember when you crashed into that aircraft carrier? Come on, Victor! Okay, let's go! Saint Christopher, help! Sun, kiss us. We are so beautiful! Look over here. Don't move. Look here. Smile! Stay just like that! Yes! Mimì. Come here, Mimì. Tony, go slowly! Mimì! He fell in the water! Victor! Hurry! Victor! Give him a life buoy! Victor, get the life buoy! Tony! Tony! Tony, hurry! I don't know how to swim! Victor, don't move! Help him! Pull him up! Let's help him! -Victor, how do you feel? -Fine. Now I really feel good! I feel awful! I feel awful! I can't go on! Help! Pull me up! What is my name? Where am I? -Goodbye. -Goodbye, Sergeant. -My friend! I'll offer you something. -No, thanks. I'm in a hurry. -Are you angry with me? -You ask? -You're referring to yesterday? -No, to when I met you! Don't be dramatic. Private life has nothing to do with military life. Outside the barracks you are my best friend. -"God save me from my friends!" -You're being dramatic. -Yes. Otello and Cassius! -Tell me about your nephew. You got gypped! The colonel's special permit. I knew that. Who recommended your nephew? You'd like to know, huh? -An important person. -Let's say an important woman. A woman? This morning's breakfast is better than yesterday's. I've never seen anyone eat like you! Why are you surprised? It's a plate of ham and two olives. Such a breakfast at 9 a.m.? We Americans get charged up right from the morning. -In America we are all like this! -Is America beautiful? Very beautiful. It's bigger than Frascati. -I'd like to go! -Say you love me and I'll take you. -When? -In 15 months when I'm free. -It's too long! -Mimì, I love you. I liked you from the first moment I met you. -Fifteen months go by quickly. -I like you too. Then I can hope! I'll go talk to your mom. -Good morning, Miss Mimì. -Good morning, Mr. Galluppi. -I'll be right there. -Take your time. -Is Don Nicola here? -No. I'm going to the electricity meters. -Alright. I'll join you. -Yes. It's the electricity payment man. He came yesterday and the day before. We must be nice to him. He checks the meters. Does he come every morning? No, he pretends to. He put a piece of wood in it! Hi, friend. How is it going? Miss, if Caterina calls, I'm not here. -She is very pretty. -Yes, but a bit cold. Cold women don't exist. We must defrost them. Want some advice? I've a flat above my apartment. I'll give you the keys. Invite her to a romantic dinner, an intimate one, with whiskey and music. Create an atmosphere with champagne, vodka, caviar, salmon, candles. When you've done all this, and she is totally relaxed, knock three times on the floor. -And then? -You leave and I'll come in! Bye! I don't like this system. Soldier Santaniello! -Why are you out at this hour? -Special permit from the colonel. You too? I come in and go out when I want. I'm the show's director. The colonel said we must beat the granatieri. Alright. Let's go. No, you go. I'm staying here to eat. -It's late. Barracks duty? -Special permit from the colonel. -No! -I go in and go out when I want. I am the general organizer of the show. The colonel said we must beat the granatieri. You go. The permit is mine. It's mine! The permit is mine! He wasn't expecting it. Why are you laughing? A sense of discipline, a sense of duty is very important! -Everyone must snap to it! -Yes, Colonel. Colonel, I ask to participate in the regiment's show. -What? You? -Yes, sir. You? No, you are needed more on barracks duty. With your face, how can we beat the granatieri? I assigned Captain Luciani. He is a music expert. -I can play the trombone. -No, we have a player. -He must be a good player. -Yes, Colonel. -The best! -Yes, Colonel! -May we take a ride? -Of course. Tony, I must tell you something. -I know. -Who told you? Nobody. I knew it from the start. It's impossible that a girl like you doesn't have a boyfriend. It's that blond boy who's always around you, huh? I don't have a boyfriend. Then don't say anything, nothing else matters. No, I must tell you something. I think that your friendship for me is influenced… By your father, the colonel? -Yes. -Ours is more than a friendship. I don't care if your father is a colonel. You could be the daughter of the sergeant. -Or the marshal. -No, not the marshal! -That is a special breed. -Do you hate marshals? If you knew the one in my barracks, you'd say I'm right. Let's go. Come in. Good morning, Marshal. -What do you want? -Red velvet. -Red velvet? -Yes. I need 100 meters of red velvet for the stage. -Should I get it? -Colonel's orders. I must get 100 meters of velvet? They said to come here. Alright, go. I need 200 meters of red trimmings that goes well with velvet. It should be very nice. -You need anything else? -Not for me. -Alright, I'll get it later. -No. They are needed right away. They need the velvet for tomorrow, Colonel's orders. -Colonel's orders. -Yes. Alright, go! Come in! Marshal, I need another 100 chairs for the theater audience. Are you crazy? Where will I get 100 chairs? They told me to come here. Colonel's orders. I'll get them. -What are you waiting for? -For you to get them. -Give me time! -No. I need the chairs tomorrow! Alright, go. Get lost! Come in! Marshal Ciccio La Rosa, I need your precious help. -You want a fountain? -No. -An elephant? -No. Four crocodiles? Eighteen clowns? No. -Marshal Ciccio, are you mad? -No, but I'm getting there! I need a platoon to transport the instruments. I'll give you an execution platoon and have you all fired! -What about the grand piano? -I don't care! -It's needed for the show! -I don't care! -Colonel's orders. -I don't care. Go! Go! Go! -Shall I go? -Go! -Shall I go? -Go! I'll go! Mom, do you know Dad well? I think he has a double life. What? I am sure your father would never cheat on me. I didn't mean in that sense. Dad is kind and affectionate, but in the barracks he's different with his subordinates. He is severe and mean, the opposite of how we know him. Why do you think that? I am sure, Mom. You should convince him to be more understanding with the soldiers. Simonetta, you've never said things like this. Mom, may I tell you a secret? I met the daughter of Colonel Bertoluzzi. I didn't know he had a daughter. Yes. She's 18, pretty and intelligent. Her name is Simonetta. Simonetta? Like Ciccio's daughter. -Who is Ciccio? -Marshal La Rosa. That scoundrel? I haven't known her long, but it's as if I always have. -You're in love! -You'll met her. She lives nearby. Nearby? Did the colonel move? -I don't know. Why? -He used to live in Via Appia. -No, they live in Via Flaminia. -Near Ciccio? -Who is Ciccio? -Marshal La Rosa! That scoundrel! Sergeant. Tony, let's go or we'll be late. Yes. Bye, Uncle. I'm going to work overtime. Take care. Via Flaminia? Simonetta? Marshal, I told you to take care of the show, but I received a serious report about you. Impossible! The show's managers complained that you're not cooperating. -That is possible. -Exactly. They asked for your help and you didn't lend your support. There has been a serious delay in organizing the show. It is at risk. Marshal, I know your high sense of duty and discipline. You think this is a serious offense? Very serious. -Can it be punished? -Yes. -With two days of arrest? -Even three. Good. You are under arrest for three days. -The marshal has been arrested. -Then I'll wash myself more happily. -I don't believe it. -All of the barracks knows. It should be a national holiday. Did you know that Marshal La Rosa was arrested? -Yes. -It's the end of the world! As soon as we're off duty, we'll all go have drinks! -Is it a celebration? -Yes, the marshal was arrested! Hello? Ciccio, it's you. I am busy with work. I won't be home for three days. I know it's never happened, but anything can happen lately. You're not coming home to sleep? Yes, you have a job with the colonel. I am a prisoner of my duty, my dear. Send a change of clothes over with Simonetta. Yes, I'll call every day. -Bye. -Bye. -Franco, did you see Simonetta? -No. Where can she be? Am I mistaken or are you in love? I don't fall in love so easily. Love comes when you don't realize it! You don't know what it is, but it is love! Simonetta is pretty, but she's just the colonel's daughter. Then why are you neglecting Lulù? She is important and beautiful too. You gave me a great idea, I'll go see Lulù so you'll get these ideas out of your head. -You have a sip too! -Mimì! -The American soldier! -He checks the meter here, too? -No, he's marrying me! -Dear, let's dance. -Sorry. -Thank you. Why would I say that? Ashes. NO SMOKING -I'm sorry. -You come in without knocking? I never knocked the other times, either. That's bad! As of today, you'll knock. Donna Lulù, shall we put it out? Let's put it out. Yes? Hi, Dad. Simonetta, Daddy's girl! Simonetta, I lied to your mother. -Dad, you tell lies? -Yes. I told her I was here for work reasons, but it's not true. Actually, a good military man must have his day in prison. Don't dramatize. I am your father. I love you and live for you. Even if I make mistakes at times. -If Patrizia calls, I'm not here. -Okay. You thought that Mimì was serious? She spoke to me like a woman in love. You're so young! You should never rely on a woman. Are you saying that we should live without women? No, women are necessary, but one must have the strength not to be tied down by them. Take it and leave it. Leave it and take it. -Be free as swallows! -Hi, Uncle. Bravo! I agree with you. You'll never be disappointed with them. Look at these boys. They are devastated! Yesterday, they were dumped. They aren't smart. I know how to choose my women and I was never dumped. Don't be so sure. Never trust women. If you say that, we won't get along! -Don Nicola is right. -No, I can prove it. When a woman is in love, she waits for her man always at the same place. Come. I'll show you. I can't come. Marisa's husband is playing bocce. You play bocce? No, but when Marisa's husband plays bocce, I go out with Marisa! You are the Leonardo da Vinci of love! -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Let's go, guys. -Cheer up! -Come on, guys. -Dear Sergeant! -Good morning to everyone. A regular customer like you couldn't miss our toast. I always toast when the happiness of others is involved. -Whose party is it? -Guess. No idea. -They're coming! -They're coming! -Them? -They newlyweds are coming! Cheers! Long live the newlyweds! Cheers! Long live the newlyweds! Cheers! -Best wishes! -Congratulations! Sergeant, don't you want a kiss from the bride? -When did it happen? -This morning at dawn. When the sun rose! With the rising sun! -Best wishes, dear. -Thank you. -Best wishes! -Best wishes, Nenè! Come on, Uncle. My Sergeant. -Misfortunes come in threes. -Yes, but I wasn't expecting it. I wasn't expecting it! Don Nicola is right. He has a lot of experience with women. He doesn't. He's just an asshole! No, Victor is right. As of today, we must trust him. He should close the trattoria and open a school of love. No, he should open a school of assholes! There is always something to learn from Don Nicola. There is always something to learn from Don Nicola. Nenè! Nenè, why did you do it? Nenè, why did you do it? Nenè! Why did you do it? -We must beat the granatieri! -Yes, Colonel. -Whatever it takes! -Yes, Colonel. -It's a matter of principle. -Yes, Colonel! -We must beat everyone! -Yes, Colonel. Yes! -Dad. -Hi, Simonetta. -You're not coming to the theater? -I can't. I've been confined. -I'm going back to the office. -I'll stay with you. -No. Go and have fun. Bye. -Bye. Attention! You can sit down. Captain Luciani, begin. Yes, Colonel. And one, two, three, four! Hurrah for women Hurrah for beautiful women Who are the pillars of love Who are the pillars of love I always think of the words That Don Nicola told me some time ago "You are too young, you are too naive" "That is the truth" Lulù swore her great love for me That angel face burned my soul But her fireman boyfriend Watered all my flames of love The story of this failure Leaves me very perplexed But if one woman is like that Another 50 say yes to me Hurrah for women Hurrah for beautiful women Who are the pillars of love Who are the pillars of love I keep thinking of Don Nicola There is something to learn from him "You are too simple, you are too shy" "That is the truth" Mimì looked at me, bewitched And said beautiful words to me "You are my light, my life" But then left with the electricity payment man That sad and unhappy experience Led me to being cautious But if one woman is like that Another 200 say yes to me Hurrah for women Hurrah for beautiful women Who are the pillars of love Who are the pillars of love But I keep remembering Don Nicola Who led me by example and with his words "You are too young, you are too sweet." "That is the truth." Nenè spoke to me of love, a clear sea without clouds. But she didn't know how to swim and left with the Japanese fleet. This other sad adventure doesn't frighten me anymore. because if one woman is like that, all the others say yes to me. Hurrah for woman, hurrah for beautiful women who are the pillars of love. Who are the pillars of love. Bravo! You didn't tell me why you invited me to lunch. You want to celebrate my professional accident? No. I didn't see you at the regiment party yesterday. I'm sorry. I'd have preferred serving your sentence myself. Don't remind me of it. I disgraced my family! Don't exaggerate. They didn't downgrade you. Even if they had, you would have become more pleasant. -Thank you. -You have already changed! You're no longer severe and finicky. You're another man! -Maybe I'll change some day. -Try to change before that. -I need some information. -Yes? Does the colonel live close to you, on Via Flaminia? No, he lives on Via Appia. -Does he have a daughter? -He has a son at the academy. You are very much informed. No doubt about that. -Why this question? -Just curious. Let's toast. -Cheers! -To what? There is a proverb that says, "Misfortune comes to all men." Cheers! -Hello, guys! -Hello, Don Nicola. If Marina calls, tell her I'm not here. -Don Nicola, you look a bit tired. -Love is wearing me out. -Love! You know what happened to me? -What? Last night I was with a splendid woman. Wonderful! I was in really great shape, at my best! In the room there was a painting with the Four Musketeers. They applauded me! Fantastic! If Marcella calls… If Marcella calls, I'll tell her that you are legally married to me! Have been for 23 years! Yes! -Shall we go? -I am with my friends. -Shall we go? -Yes. Get up! -I'm going. -Arm. -I am who calls the… -Let's go! Did you see? Your teacher is married! It's always the best that go. To marriage! Did you ever imagine there were such marshals in Italy? Extinct! The last one was in our regiment and until yesterday made the barracks tremble. He even had the floor and windows tremble. He had the lesson he deserved. It's crazy! I couldn't believe it. The marshal was arrested for the first time. We broke him! We did it! You and me! Enough! Don't say anything else, coward! But, Simonetta… I learned a lot about you tonight and I'll tell you the truth. I am not the colonel's daughter. I am the daughter of Marshal La Rosa, the executioner! You made me ashamed of him. I will have to apologize my whole life. I don't ever want to see you again! -Will you dance with me? -Yes. Mr. Tony, it's your turn. It was a look of love The sword is in my heart And there it will stay You're beautiful At this moment you are more beautiful Now that the wind Is taking you away from me Night has suddenly fallen My heart has stopped beating It's raining and the sun is out You see who is born and who dies For you It was a look of love The sword is in my heart I feel like I'm dying Dying for you When you saw him, you changed You lit up "He's just a friend" It wasn't true "I am yours" It wasn't true It was a look of love The sword is in my heart And there it will stay You're beautiful At this moment, more beautiful Now that the wind Is taking you away from me Suddenly night falls My heart no longer beats It's raining and the sun is out You see who is born and who is dying For you It was a look of love The sword is in my heart I feel like I'm dying Dying for you Beautiful days It was always spring Until yesterday Your thoughts Were all for me I see you Laughing I can still hear the echo I am playing Your smiles Your caresses for me It was a look of love The sword is in my heart And there it will stay You are beautiful at this moment More beautiful now that the wind Is taking you away from me Night has suddenly fallen My heart no longer beats Simonetta. Let me tell you one thing. At first I was just interested in the colonel's daughter because she could give me what I came to Italy for. But eventually, everything changed, up to the point of… -Sorry, Tony, I must go home. -I won't keep you. Forgive me for what I did. I wanted to tell you that… I love you, Simonetta. -I love you. -Tony! I stop her and say, "Miss, you are fascinating, striking from the first second." She slapped me! Can you believe it? Simonetta! Soldier Tony Marconi, I want an explanation! -I ask for your daughter's hand. -What? -Dad, I Iove him too. -Ciccio! Your daughter couldn't find a better man! Look at him. He looks like his uncle! You knew and didn't warn me! No. I didn't understand much at first. -And after? -Even less. -I understand. -Dad… -We'll become relatives. -It was destiny! Fellow townsmen, fellow comrades and relatives! -What level of relationship is that? -Brothers-in-law. -Not brothers-in-law! -Step brothers. -Romulus and Remus. -Nonsense! Ciccio, I'll tell you what our relationship is. Come. -But the kids will be alone. -Don't be a Sicilian! It is 1970! Come. What? Hold still! You're hurting me! Subtitles edited by: Mariela Rascioni
