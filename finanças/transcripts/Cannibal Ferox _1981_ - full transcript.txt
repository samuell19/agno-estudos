Don't play cute! We've been looking for your friend Mike for a month. Son of a bitch took off with a 100 Grand. A 100 Grand. Our 100 Grand from our dope. I didn't know. I didn't know anything about it. Come on shitface, where is he? I tell you I don't know, I don't know! This is so you know what Mike's got coming to from ripping us off, Pigface! I have nothing to do with it. Let me go, please? Ok. Just let me go. Sure. So you can tip him off uh? Shitface! No I won't. I won't - I swear. Hey Bernie, I owe you 5 bucks Who was he? Tim Berret. A user. Casual pusher. He was released from a treatment center this morning. Yeah? How long he's been there? 5 Weeks. They thought he'd made it over the hunt. Yeah, he has now. Girlfriend? No, she owns the apartment. The Janitor says her name is Mirna Stann. She's a tour guide, out of town at the moment so it seems What is he doing here then? Who knows? Maybe looking for someone? You know how this sounds like to me? - No. Sounds like a hassle between small time pushers! Look. Trace the girl. She's the only one who can lead us to anything. And I want a detailed report from ballistics as soon as they're through. See you Sergeant. - Alright! Missed the Giants again. What a hole, Rudy! I thought Paraguay was gonna be a REAL town? Yeah, with discotheques and with a Macy's Branch store and 2 or 3 guys rolling by on their Kawasaki's, uh? Some vacation I had to go and pick for myself. You two sure suckered me on this one! I told you. Never trust my sister. Never trust you and your adventures in the jungle. Come on, Gloria. Let's go change that damned dollars of yours, OK? I wanna try and find myself a shower! We'll be lucky if we can find some gas. Hm. Yeah! Good morning Good morning Good morning, sir Good morning, welcome to Paraguay Money exchange, please. What happens around here? Nothing, madam, nothing ever You are lucky, until today there was no money Ah, excuse me! Is there any way to get a shower around here? In my private home, madam, there is no hotel here! What did he say? He wants to take you home! He has a shower. Please Yes? In Bogota they told me to follow this road until here to here and then... Where do you want to go? We don't know exactly, Senor. We're looking for a village called Manyoca...! I don't know any village called Manyoca, madam. There are so many, so small and dangerous. Animals, hungler, snakes, you understand madam? But there must be a village by that name, I'm sure There is a river Manyoca, but to go in there by car is too difficult. You must cross the Rio and then follow the trail for 80 miles, and the road is very bad. You have to go by foot, madam It's dangerous, very dangerous You should go back to the capital Your money, madam Thank you Well Sergeant. How about that shower? That dumb twat's really getting to me. I almost wish she'd get left behind. We still got half an hour to go. She'll get here. Go, go, come Bye Bye, Juanita How did the shower go? Oh not bad. So long banito. And try washing some time, uh! Bye, sweetheart. Everything for the country, hurray America! Listen, please, do you know a village called Manyoca? No, madam, I don't Bet this village of yours doesn't even exist. You probably dreamed it up one night while you were writing your thesis. I didn't dream anything up. Look at this article. It was written 4 years ago. August 21st, 1976. Hmm... We heard several reports recently that along on the Frenco River, one of the Amazon's major tributaries at least 3 incidents of cannibalism had been witnessed by outsiders. In the village of Manyoca... oh you can't believe everything you read. She didn't believe it either. That's why we're here. In 2 months, thank god, it will all be over. I'll present my dissertation and then I'll be through hearing about cannibals. Mind if a dummy asks what it is you hope to find in this blessed village? I told you. My thesis claims that cannibalism as an organized practice of human society does not exist. And historically has never existed. So much the better, dear! According to Gloria, men eat men is bullshit. Let's say it was an invention of racist colonialism. Which had a vasted interest in creating the myth of the ferocious subhuman savage fit only for extermination. The mythical lie of Cannibal Ferox was only an alibi to justify the greed and cruelty of the conquistadores. But what's Manyoca got to do with it? Well, if we can prove, that the incidents of cannibalism reported by that magazine, never actually happened... ...I have rock solid definitive support for my P.H.D. Dissertation. Well you promised to take a bunch of pictures of me. And that's all I care about. Hey man. You think there is a chance we'll bump into a few cocoa leaves? Gloria, do you believe this? Hey what's that? What? It's called the queen of marks you have to eat it or it brings bad luck Why is he... He's doing it to avoid bad luck. What's the matter, Gloria? Are you alright? What did she say? This cozumbo can save you, Madam. It's dangerous out there and if it's around, the snakes will attack him and not the americans, clear? Claro! Very clear. The life of the weak, for that of the strong! You stake him out and the snakes will go for him instead of us. The law of the jungle. You want me to drive? No. I can take it for another hour or so! Oh look! An iguana! Don't hit it... Where the hell are you going? Damn. Jay walking Iguana. That's all we need now. Alright. Gloria, you drive and I push, ok? Yeah - Shit! Come on. Pat, get out and help. Easy. Don't race it too much. That's it. That's it. Rock it. Go. Go! Ok hold it. That's it! Score one for the good guys. Oh shit. Good boy Rudy. We got 1000s of bottles of Whiskey. Hey leave some for the troops! I'll pretend it's a mint tulip. Don't move. Don't move. It's alright now, princess. You're still the fairest to the land. Just kidding. Looks like you're ready for that drink. Why couldn't we've made it Acapulco instead of this poisoned paradise? All you would've found there, would've been white Widows! All these trees! Not even a trail anymore! Oh, cut it out! A little positive thinking never hurt anyone. So what do you wanna do? Go on or go back? There is nothing marked on this map. Nothing but swamp. It's simple, let's toss a coin! For me it's no problem. Either way, I don't give a shit! Ok. Head's we go on and Tail's we give in. Flip it. - Ok! Heads! Should've come with a Hovercraft! I wish I'd gone to Acapulco. Hey, I think we're sinking! Shit. The engine's blown. There goes our transport. Ok, Let's get everything we can carry out before it all goes under. Yeah. Right. Don't forget the whiskey. You worry about the First Aid Kit and the batteries. And I'll get the rest. I hate to see it all go down the drain because a jeep gets stuck! Now we have 2 options: One we turn back. Paraguay is a 3 or 4 day hike. Or we hove it to the river assuming we can find it. Does it make a difference? No. I mean either way we gotta hike so move ahead. You never know, we may run into somebody to hitch a ride from. Or better yet, even stumble on your blessed village and kill two parrots with one cracker! Stay where you are. How disgusting. Let's get out of here. I've got a bad feeling! Rudy! Rudy wake up! What's happening? An Anaconda! Oh poor little thing! Forget it Gloria. There's nothing you can do! That might have been one of us. How much longer we got to go? I've had it. Oh my poor feet! Oh, come on. Think positive! The river can't be too far now. Come on. This way! Oh my god. I wanna get out of here. Get out of here! I want out. Stop it. You'll only make it worse. Stop it! I'm going crazy, I can't, I can't! That's enough. Cut it out! Help us. Help us. Quickly gimme a hand with him and let's move. Who are you guys? What happened? Cannibals. They attacked us. We gotta get out of here. Come on! Pat. Get my gear. The Manyoca River is less than 2 miles away. If we can make it, we'll be okay Feeling better now? Yeah thanks. Only a swallow, ok? Ok! Last bottle we got left! Yeah, we're from New York too. My name is Mike. Mike Logan. The asshole there is Joe. A born loser! Unlucky, he? Uh-hum. Just a fuck-up! Want some. No. I don't drink. This here is my speed! Cocaine? Want some? Snow is bottom line. It doesn't break you down. No needles, no horseshit and you feel real. You haven't told us yet, what you were doing in that clearing. What happened to you? Right, it isn't like we met in Rockefeller Center, is it? Had a bad trip, didn't we Joe? We came down here about a month ago. From Tenuyo. We hopped on down the Paraguay to stock up on snow. And that's where we met this guy! Who? Oh, A Portuguese. Emerald prospector. Soares was his name. A good looking guy. About 30. Been down here for years. So I got this idea. Why not join up with him, I said to Joe. We'll all go into business together. Emeralds and Cocaine. Can't miss me. But... How'd you get out here? We travelled upstream to Manyoca. Started panning the riverbed, all three of us. That Portuguese was real sharp. Then a week ago... What happened? A week ago, just as when we were zeroing in what looked like a rich vein, we began to notice that they were there, hanging around in the bushes... Listen, Mike! Shut up asshole. I wanted to turn back but Soares said they were harmless. Anyway one night they suddenly jumped us three. Took us prisoner and dragged us off to that damned village. It's 10 miles away from here. Maybe less, who knows. It was a bad bad scene. But, how can you be so sure they were cannibals? Maybe they were only primitives Oh yeah, twat? Then listen to what your primitives did to us! When we got to that damn village, they shut us up in a bamboo cage. Stuck in a stinking mud hole. Infested with 3 inch long bloodsuckers. We had dozens all over us in minutes. You wanna know how much blood we lost? The Portugese got the worst of it. God knows why, but they seemed to hate him with a passion. They tied him to a stake in the middle of the village. And then... Go on Mike! ...and then they castrated him with a machete, and then they ate his genitals... No Mike damn it. Stop it. That's enough. It doesn't matter. It's been done. Ok. Ok, Joe. The main thing is that we got out of it. We managed to escape with the help of those two poor bastards back there. You saw them, didn't you? They tied him to a stake and they castrated him with a machete and then they ate his genitals. Cannibalism as an organized practice of human society does not exist. Don't you ever get bored playing with your six-shooter? Gloria? Gloria! Gloria! Hey what's up? Gloria has disappeared, we gotta do something. She can't be far. Calm down. Joe, wake up! I'm awake! We gotta try to find Gloria. Now you go with Rudy and try to keep out of the heavy brush as much as possible. I'll search along the riverbed with Pat. Wait a minute. I got no weapons, Mike! Rudy has got his machete. Now get going. Pat. Come on! Gloria! Gloria? Oh Christ. A village. Listen, let's turn back. If they catch us, they'll tear us to pieces. Looks like there's no one there? Maybe they're all gone? Wait for me here! Don't be crazy, Rudy! They'll kill you, they'll kill you! Let's get out of here. Look. Please! That's the Portugese? Yeah. But let's go. Let's get out of here! Gloria! Where are you? Shh. Listen. Help. Help. Gloria, are you alright? Oh God. Help me Mike. Help me please! Don't move. Don't move. Alright, alright. It's all over. Come on. Don't just stand there. Give me a little help. Oh my God. Did you have to torture it that way? What you get off on ecology, huh twat? You're out of your mind. You scared the pants off of all of us. How did you fall into that damn hole? I've got no idea. I wanted to go and have a wash in the river and the ground just gave way under me... And you were damn lucky. The Indios usually plant a poisoned shag pile of bamboo stakes in their traps. Where are the others? Haven't you had enough yet? There's something, I can't figure out! What's that? I don't know, but how come all the younger indios have left the village and when we go near those old ones over there. Why do they act so scared? I told you the whole story. How could they not be uptight after what happened? Yeah. Yeah maybe it's like you say. But they seem scared of us. Of our white skin. As if we were gonna do something to them. Should be the other way around. Oh come on. Cut it with this drivel. Listen. I'd say Gloria's question has been well answered. Is this sufficient? Is this what you wanted to know? Yes. Let's turn back. The sooner the better. Joe. Joe. Oh Christ. He's fainted. Here, make him drink. He is really sick. I've got some cormen in the first aid kit! Pulse rate is very weak. Mike! Help me get him in the shade. Burning. Burning up. Do something. Now take it easy. Be patient. You'll feel better tomorrow, you'll see. Here. Let me give him a sip of water. Pus is forming in the wounds. I am afraid of blood poisoning. What are we going to do now? Give him all the antibiotics you've got left and let's leave him here. Better only one of us buys it right. We can build a stretcher and take him with us. Bullshit. We wouldn't get 3 miles and it would be useless anyway. Then we'll wait here until he can walk again. Listen, twat. I can probably make it on my own. But I like you kids so I'll stay with you and we'll sink or swim together. Now I've got 4 slugs in this thing still no use against the cannibals but enough for us. If they come back. Bang! That's it. Agreed? Agreed! Give me just a little more. It's fantastic. What do you do in the big apple? I was working in a motel to pay my way through college a shitty 160 a week to clerk nights in the Bronx. On your toes from dusk till dawn. 6 Nights a week. What a shuffle for me. No extras? Oh. A little now and then. When we get some fellow with a briefcase full of bread. That didn't take much effort, did it? Oh, macho attitude. Red neck dudes are really a pain. Instead of screwing, Wilbur sits around all night and complains to you about his dingy old lady and his tax returns. Real assholes! Wanna know something? Had you nailed down the minute I saw you! Oh you did? What, that I'm being a whore? All the way! A hot pussy little whore, who arrived down here looking for freedom. A victim of puritanical breeding, seeking release for a strange new feeling. Hey. How would you like to make an Indio Girl? There they are! They've been playing with that tortoise since early morning. Let's give them a surprise. - Ok! Watch him. Hold it. She's a virgin. If I ever saw one. Just like me. I imagine. Now hold still you little bitch. Now you try anything and I'll cut your throat out. We only wanna have some fun, you see. We'll be doing it. Just hold still. What are you waiting for, Pat? Come on. Enjoy! Make her scream. Don't be shy. She's all yours. Go ahead, Pat. She's only a filthy little cannibal. Cut her. Don't be afraid. Come on. Let's see some blood. Diana... Diana... Diana... Diana... Diana... Shut up. Or I'll blow your mouth out the other side of your head. Mike! You didn't have to do that! Why'd you kill her, you bastard? Get off my case motherfucker! Get out of here. Get up, run! Come on! Don't try it again or you'll end up like her, understand? Rudy! Rudy! Rudy! What's the matter? It's Joe. He's had a relapse. His fever is very high and he's having difficulty breathing. The infection is spreading. Did you give him any pills? The cormen is all finished. All we have left is a little quionite. What you need is more antibiotics. But it's probably too late now. Anyway, you know what the indios call Blood Poisoning? The sickness within the sickness. If one of them happens to get it, they separate him from the others and let him die. And crows arrive to keep the guy company. Hundreds of 'em. Shrieking and cawing and biding time until they... Come on. Drop it, will you? Ok! There is the root of a plant. The Sokaney. It can bring fever down. I'll go look around for some. Be back before dark. What happened down at the river? I heard a shot! He killed a young indio girl. I don't know why! But one thing is for sure. I wouldn't put anything past that bastard. Get me out of here, get me out of this swamp Joe. It's full of piranhas. Calm down, calm down. Why don't you get some sleep? No. I couldn't sleep. We've been two dummies, haven't we, Rudy? What a waste of vacation. And maybe our lives too? Yeah. No... I don't wanna die. Don't leave me here to die! Don't leave me here... Come on Joe, don't worry. Joe, we're going to take you with us. I promise. Now just be good, ha? Listen, Gloria. There is something I gotta tell you! You can tell us tomorrow. Calm down No. I have to tell you about it. Listen. None of that story is true what Mike said about the cannibals. What do you mean. That what he told you is a lot of bad shit. But we all saw the Portugese tied to the stake! You saw an unrecognizable corpse. Now listen to me. You're gonna hear everything. There never was any Portugese named Soares. He was just an Indio that we met in Paraguay. He was a real smart dude. Mike nicknamed him an Portugese coz he could speak a few words of the language. Mike and I had to split from New York in a hurry cause we pulled a sting at a couple of Brooklyn Horsemen. We came down here planning to prospect for emeralds. Mike had got this fixation. He kept pumping the Indio about where we could find some. And finally he gave us the information we wanted. At a place called Manyoca there was a river full of stones. He'd found a lot of them there himself. When Mike asked for proof, he pulled out three uncut emeralds. Anyway we took off the next morning with the Indio as our guide. The idea was to rip him off, swipe all the Emeralds he'd already found. We figured he must've had a big pile of them hidden some place. Most likely in his home village. Mike had me really going. All I could think about was, that I was gonna be rich. We would hit when the time was right. Fast and final. We panned a gravel at the Manyoca River Bed for over a week with the help of some local indios. Man, we must've sifted through a hundred tons of that silt. But we didn't find a single gem. One morning, while the Indios were all hard at it, the Portugese and his buddy sure weren't expecting it. They thought white men were all fair and honest. We made them take us to the village. It was all going easier than we thought. All the young bucks were off somewhere fishing and most of the women ran away into the jungle. Just those with babies and a bunch of old fogies were all that was left. First thing Mike did, was take the guy's three emeralds off him. Then he began torturing him to make him tell where he'd stashed the rest. The Portugese kept screaming that he only had those three stones. That Mike kill him if he didn't believe him. But Mike had a better idea. With all that cocaine he was on, Mike went completely crazy. He seemed to get a perverted kick out of making that poor son of a bitch suffer. I couldn't take anymore of that butchery. I tried to make him stop but Mike just got more and more hysterical and pushed me away. Then... he moaned and groaned all night long but he didn't die until the next morning. God, how he suffered. We couldn't stay in the village any longer. We had to get out of there before the younger men came back from their fishing. Mike decided to take along a hostage. Someone who could also guide us back from the jungle. Well, after we made maybe a mile that son of a bitch trap there came down and got the girl. Then this warrior charged out like a maniac but Mike is a tough customer. Yeah. It was Mike who killed the guy. But before Mike got him, he shoved his pig sticker into me and you showed up right after that. But then, the cannibals... This is absurd. It's crazy! I thought it was a little fishy. I knew it! Just looking at those old men out there. The fear and the hate in their eyes. He must be totally insane. With what he's done, he has driven them right back to the level of animals. Oh god, they are so exagerated. God only knows what they'll do to us if they catch us. And worse. They're sure not gonna split any hairs. We'll all pay for this. Guilty or not! We have to get away from him. Now! And get Pat away from him. God damn it. Where is Pat? They've gone! And they've took everything with them. My camera, the First Aid Kit, the compass, everything. And the 5000 Dollars I kept with the map. Pat! How could she do this to us? Leaving us here alone. With Joe in there dying. Mike sucked her in. Pat is a doormat. Totally insecure. Oh god, I thought I knew her. It's all our fault. We should never have brought her along. Oh. She seemed to easy going. Like she could handle herself. Anyway. Spilled milk is spilled milk. Oh Rudy. Rudy I can't. Come on now, sis. Don't make it worse. After all Stanley found what's his name, didn't he? It's a round world. You can'tjust fall off. Come on. Let's start with the visit to a legendary Opium Den. The House of Ming. This way please. Let's move it along. This way. Move along. We're running late. Come on. That's her. There. Now then. The house of Ming dates from 1867... Excuse me, Miss. Are you Mirna Stann? Yes. Why? Lieutenant Liseu. 17th Precinct. I'd like you to come with me. But I can't do that now! I am working. So am I! How long have you been living in that apartment on McDougal Street? About 1 year. You live alone? Most of the time. Lately I've had a temporary border. A guy I've met in a bar. Mike Logan? How did you know? It's not important. Look what do you know about Mike Logan? Nothing much. I'm not the nosy type like you. Yes. But if you live with the man you gotta know something about him, right? Yeah. He's tall, slim and nice, maybe a little wild for my taste. But what are you so interested in Mike for? Because the boy that was murdered in your apartment used to buy smack from your dear friend Mike. Come on. Where's he hiding. I haven't the faintest idea. I didn't even know about what happened in my place. I told you, I've been in Vegas for the past 5 weeks. When you picked me up this morning we've just gotten in. Ok. Get back to work! Madam, be careful. Ok? And if you hear of anything gimme a call. Ross. Yeah. I want you to put a tail on that girl. Around the clock, get me? Yeah but that's gonna cost a lot. I don't care what it costs. We get federal aid, don't we? Just do it. - Alright. Poor Joe. What a waste. You know in a way Mike killed him too. Who knows how they met each other. We know nothing about him. Not even his last name. They probably took his passport as well. Listen. Now we gotta think about us. Let's bury him and get out of here. I figured if we follow the Manyoca River upstream, there must be other villages. Let's go. - Ok! A rotten Papaya. Do you know what that means? Yeah. - A curse on us. But Rudy. I'm scared. It's too quiet here. I know something is gonna happen. There is someone here. Don't watch! No! No! I think I'm gonna be sick. Get me out of here! I think the river is somewhere over there. Maybe we're safe there. Run! Go! Throw down the knife Rudy. It's better! Rudy! Damn it. Do something. Pat! Pat! Please Rudy! Help me! Let us out of here. Cannibalism doesn't exist. It has never existed! Why did you wanna meet out here? Did Mike send you? Where is Mike? No way honey. You know very well where that son of a bitch is and you're gonna tell us! Come on Bitch. Where is your stud? I don't know where Mike is! Wrong Answer! Lay off me you bastard. I don't know anything. I swear it. Come on! The Police! Let's get out of here. No. Please! No. We'll get her later. Are you alright, Miss Stann? Yeah. But how do you know my name? I've been tailing you for 3 days. Aren't you honoured? You could have ended up on a slab also! Then we have 2 murders instead of 1. Thanks to your precious Mike Logan. Look, why are you trying to hide from me the fact. That Mike was your boy-friend. Are all you girls today so stupid? Listen. 6 Weeks ago, your precious little Mike ripped off a 100.000 Dollars from a Brooklyn Mob and they're all over the city these days headhunting for him. That can't be. 6 Weeks ago, I was pregnant. And Mike made me get rid of it. He said he was broke. That with no security he'd be damned if he brought kids into the world. Mike was loaded. Too loaded. Ok. Come on. Tell me. Tell me where he is. Up to 3 weeks ago he was in Bogota, in Columbia. He called me one night and said he was going into the Amazon. Paraguay. Yeah I think that was the name of the place. Wait here! Bill. I want you to telex Interpol in Bogota. Put a tracer on a Mike Logan. Presumed to be in Paraguay. You can get the mud details from Ross. Got it? Hell all I've been doing is telexing Bogota. Last night about three students who drove off in their range rover disappeared. And now this Logan jerk. How do you spell that Paraguay? Don't worry how you spell it, uh! Just hurry it up! What are they doing to him? Corterizing the wound. Otherwise he'd bleed to death! Will we be tortured like that? Or be killed? Rudy! Where are they taking us? I don't know! I dropped my chain necklace back in the village. And also my sunglasses and credit card! Our only hope is for someone to find them. Only if someone notices we disappeared. If it's not too late already. Anyway, whenever we get a chance one of us has to make a break for it. Try to find help. We're gonna land. Listen! I think I can make it. No Rudy. Don't! It's too dangerous. We'll never get out of this alive. Can't lose anything by trying. Help me. Distract their attention. Just before we touch. Yell like crazy and dump yourself into the water. Ok, sis? Ok! Help Me. For god's sake. Help me! Do something. Rudy! Oh please help him! Rudy! Gloria! Gloria! Are you hurt? No it's nothing. I don't wanna be killed. I don't wanna be killed. Help me Gloria. Help me! Oh Pat. Don't cry Pat. I'm so scared - Calm down. Water, Water! Give me some water. I am so thirsty. Please! I'll kill you! Starvation. We'll just shrivel up and die in here! Damn fool. What'd you say? What a god damn fool I was. Thinking I had to leave NY to find the reasons behind Cannibalism. Do you realise, it's us, the so called civilized people who are responsible for their cruelty... That is not... us and our superior society. But that's completely nuts. No. Violence breeds violence. No Don't. It could be Rudy's! No. No Please I can't. I can't take this anymore. I can't take it anymore. I want out of here. I wanna get out! No Pat. Don't cry dear. Let's sing something. Sing? Yes, sing. To keep our spirits up and show they can't break us down. Alright? Ah, I recognise this gentleman. He was here about 3 weeks ago, madam, with another blonde guy. But now I don't know where they could be, but the others... As I informed the consul they left with the jeep searching for the Manyoca river I don't know more. I understand, Sergeant What did he say? Mike Logan and Joseph Castellani did come through here. And so did the others. But he doesn't know where they went. Bad conversation, madam, in Amazonas people ignore the danger and sometimes they pay with their lives. I'm sorry. What can we do? Sergeant, this is a police matter. You have to take these children back, right now! Where... and how? You don't have a helicopter? A guide who knows the area? Senorita don't worry. We have the seaplane... We'll bring them back Captain? Yes sergeant Order the seaplane, we leave now Ok. You hear that? There is someone coming! You got it? Yeah! Mike! Pull us out. Come on, what are you waiting for? No. Mike! Why are you turning? We're heading back. They couldn't have gotten beyond this point. Jungle is too dense. Hold on. Let's make a last try a little to the south. Have you got enough gas for that? Yes. Help! Hey, I'm here. Help me! I'm down here. Come back. Nothing. I think we're wasting our time. Wanna turn back to Paraguay? No. Not yet! I was dreaming of our house. Up in Butternut Hill. In New Jersey. And my old man was standing there balling and spying at me. And he was saying: Come here and let daddy hold you. You're forgiven Patricia! Forgiven? On my 16th birthday I took off with this Johnny. It's been so long. You know I haven't thought about my dad for more than 3 years. Since he died. He was bedridden for months. Didn't ask one word about me. You were very fond of him, weren't you? Yeah. Don't hurt me, please! Gloria! Gloria! No. No! Look, there it is. On the right. Can you take us down over there? Have you got enough space? I'll try. Hang on. It was Davison's. I recognize the plate! Mr. Wilson. I gave this watch to Mike. I had his initials engraved in the casing. Sancho. Can you talk to him? See if he knows anything? Ask him where he found these things, could you? What is it he's saying? He said there were five people in a canoe. It was overturned and they were all eaten by crocodiles. God in Heaven. Then there is nothing else to do. Let's go back to Paraguay. Oh God. Please let her die soon. Oh let her die soon. And let me die soon too, please! No! Don't die now. No. Please. No! Don't die! Come on now, sis. After all Stanley found what's his name, didn't he? It's a round world. You can'tjust fall off. You said we can get over $500 for him? Oh, at least. Can't wait till I get the fuck out of this poisoned Paradise. I'll fly right up to Acapulco and Taiwan for 10 days. That ain't no holler man. No Monkey of any kind. Hey, Jose. Help me! We are gathered here today for a most happy event! The awarding of a doctor's degree in Anthropology to Miss Gloria Davis. We are overjoyed to have Gloria back among us. Our illustrious student miraculously survived a tragic accident that took place just 3 months ago in the Amazon jungle. She went down to that god forsaken area out of her love for science. To collaborate first hand her doctoral dissertation: Cannibalism: End of a Myth. With her were her brother Rudolph acting as research assistant and three other courageous companions. All of whom lost their lives when their canoe capsized. To these daring young adventurers whose spirits are with us here today, I'm sure go our heart felt appreciation and professional applause. Gloria has understandably decided to refrain from recounting her harrowing ordeal. But what matters is the fact, that she brought back confirmation of the correctness of her theory Thus contributing to the destruction of a cruel myth: The notion that man eats man. She has demonstrated in some that Anthropophagi does not exist. Thus it is with great pride in the name of this institute that I bestow upon Gloria Davis the academic title of Doctor of Sciences and Anthropology with an honourable mention in the form of this gold medal. Gloria! Gloria!
