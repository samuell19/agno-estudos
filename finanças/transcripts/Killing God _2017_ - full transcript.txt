Excuse me? Could you move, please? I almost hit you. Nothing. Incredible... Come on, move! Are you ok? Is something wrong? No notice. Dad? Why not run him over? Are you mad, or what? What's going on? Are you mad or... or what? I may be mad, but not in the way you think. Don't worry, sweetie. It's ok. Can we go now? Go, but you're going to die... And your family too. Get out of the car! Get your sister out of here! Cris! Get your sister out! Get her out! KILLING GOD That was the best night of my life. Mwah! That was the best night of my life! Mwah! Can you stop? Unbelievable. That was the best night of my life! Mwah! Say it again and I'll be mad. The best night... -Carlos, please. -...of my life. -Too far. -Mwah! What do you want? Your them to see us like this? I want you to tell me why your boss sent you this SMS: "That was the best night of my life. Mwah!" It's a joke. I told you. Tell me again, with all the juicy details. -Unbelievable. Tell you again? -Yes, all the juicy details. Fine. -We left the convention. -What time? -At 09:00 pm. -You told me 09:15 pm. -I said at 09:00 pm. -No, you said 09:15 pm. I remember. Lying involves memory, love. Fine. It was either 09:00 or 09:15 pm. -We went for Japanese food. -Japanese food? How romantic, modern! -Then for gin and tonics. -Was it expensive? -What? -Was the Japanese expensive? -I don't know, he paid. -He paid? Good tactic. -What's this about gin and tonics? -We had some afterwards. How many? -A couple each. -Are you sure? I had two, I think he had three. He had three... You don't drink. You had two? Yes. -You said a couple, now it's three? -Yes. -If I keep pushing you, maybe four? -It was three. -Four at the count of one, two... -Carlos! I had two. -He had three. -And then? -We went to bed. -Same hotel? -You know it was. -Same room? -No. -That's it? -Yes. -Do you swear? -Yes. -On my life? -Yes. -Swear on your mother's life? -Carlos, that's enough. -For her to die, burning to death, suffering like a rat? So... after a lovely evening in a Japanese restaurant, you go for some gin and tonics, then to the hotel -and that's it? -Yes. That was the best night of your fucking boss' life? Either your boss has had a dreadfully boring life... -Or... -Or what? I'll go. It's my brother and father. By the way, open some more wine. Make tonight the best night of my life. Mwah! Son? Middle of nowhere! Well! What a door! The forecast was for clear skies! -Did you find it ok? -Yes, with your brother's GPS. Isn't this place a little isolated? That's the idea: a quiet New Year's Eve. -How are things with you? -Good, my heart will kill me soon. -That's nonsense, you know it. -Then why am I on ten pills a day? Which he doesn't even take. Santi! How are you? -A little better. -You're sure? In the daytime, yes. I only want to kill myself at night. We'll have a great time! Say hi to Ana, and I'll show you around. Why celebrate New Year's here? -It's really scary. -Ask Ana, she arranged it. -Are you crying? -No, it's the onions -for a Spanish omelet. -Damn it, an omelet. -You love it. -We ate it last night, and today. -We'll make something else. -You're not crying? No, it's just the onion. Come on. By the way, don't suck up to Ana about her being thinner... -Why? -Because she's not thin. -Hello! -Eduardo! Hello. -So? How's the heart? -Well... worse than yesterday, but better than tomorrow. Don't say that, you'll bury us all. I wish. -Santi! -Hello, lovely. -You've lost weight. -Really? -He says I'm fatter. -My brother's an idiot. -Have you been crying? -No, it's the onion. It's your favorite. No. They've had it two days straight. Really? We'll make something else. We can cut more cold meat, tomato bread... While you finish up, I'll show them the house, okay? No. You finish supper and I'll show them the house. You're the woman, I'm the alpha male. I'll help with supper. The house can wait. They can discuss their business and we can discuss ours. Shall we open this wine? -How's Dad? -Same old hypochondriac. He worries he could go at any time, but takes no notice of doctors, or his diet or pills... The world revolves around him. He goes out, doesn't say where, and comes back when he wants to. He's changed, Carlos. Since Mom died... -It's normal, don't mind him. -I live with him. It's not easy. It's not. He's really strange. You wouldn't recognize him. He goes out a lot. He smokes more joints than I do. If you need a wee or a poo, the bathroom is up there. The bedroom is very "you". Very "me"? So? You like it then? It's shit, I'm not sleeping here. -Isn't there a better one? -Yes, my one. Dad's is far more scary. Not looking after yourself? Why? My wife did just that all her life, and we buried her six months ago. It's a waste of time. I guess you need more time to get over losing María. At my age there's no time to recover from such a blow. Now death panics me more than ever, but I'd rather die doing what the fuck I want. -I've decided to do whatever I fancy. -And what's that? Well... I eat whatever I want, drink more than ever, I smoke the odd joint, and have stopped going to mass. My last visit to church was my wife's funeral. I prefer to visit whores. I swapped priests for whores, and I'm better off, that's for sure. I'm 72 years old. I had only ever been with my wife. I always wondered about being with another, so I hired an escort. Did you like it? I loved it. She was a young girl, about your age. Sweet, delicate, pretty... and real dirty! A professional. Told me what I wanted to hear, and made me feel special. -Expensive, but... -Your son said that you had changed, but I didn't expect this. Have there been many? Quite a few. I'm wasting the inheritance, I feel bad for the boys. There'll be nothing left for them. -I've become selfish. -Know what I think? Fuck them! To the whores! To the whores! So? How are things with Marisa? -The truth? Or sugar-coated? -The truth. Terrible. I haven't shot myself yet as getting a gun is hard in Spain. Why doesn't she want to be with me? We've been together since we were 17. She's treated you like shit. Forget her, she's not worth your misery. It's still the black guy. A friend saw them, hand in hand, buying roast chicken and... She fell for the typical African, no papers, no Spanish... It won't last long. Not African, Argentinian. -A black Argentinian? -Yes. Argentinian. Shit... how strange. -I've never met a black Argentinian. -And he's 18. He's young! Is Marisa a pedophile now, or what? It's rare for women. It's normally guys, right? I do remember a news story about a 45-year-old teacher who went out with a pupil of 14 or 15. Did she force him to have sex? No, they were in love. They loved each other, but... he was 15, his parents got angry and they reported her. Was she hot? -What? -Was the teacher hot, a MILF? I don't remember, Carlos. I called her again recently, Marisa. Shit. Still calling her? I got wound up, I insulted her. She got angry, the bitch was lethal. Stop calling. Have some pride? She said it's because he's huge. They fuck all day, non-stop. She hurts from all the fucking... -Know what else? -No. The best night of her life was with him. That really fucked me up. He can fuck her all he likes, but after 20 years together, a black guy from Buenos Aires, after 3 months, is the best night of her life? And it's not because he's black. Carlos, you know that I'm no racist, right? But, seriously? She left me for an 18-year-old huge dick that makes her come 6 times a night. Fucking great! Fucking great! Forget it. Forget about it? Open that suitcase. No, the Masters one. Look what's inside. What is it? -A penis enlarger. -Shit! No, it's clean. Are you doing this for Marisa? -Of course. -You want a bigger dick? Look... all guys want to have a bigger dick. It's normal, Carlos. It's pathetic, really pathetic. Santi, what are these? -Trying to scare us again? -Sleeping pills. I know. But take more than 30, you don't wake up, you know that. I take one, Carlos. Sometimes only half, I swear. Carlos, really. Forget about Marisa. You're young, there are lots of girls. I'd like to see what you'd do, Carlos, if Ana left you for another. I hope it doesn't happen to you. -What are you discussing? -Football. An Argentinian player who scored six times. Continue downstairs, supper is almost ready. Great, omelet for the third time in 24 hours. -What are you doing? -What color is your boss? -What? -Is he black? Is he? Answer me! Carlos, you're scaring me. Calm down. I'm calm. -Is he black, or not? -What's it to you? It matters, Ana. I need to know. Go to hell. Do you know the one about a woman who was in bed having sex with her husband's friend when the telephone rang. After hanging up, she says, "That was Harry, but don't worry he won't be home for a while. He's playing cards with you." Fucking jokes. I think it's really funny. Don't you? Want another? We're tired, Eduardo. There's always tomorrow. -Here, have this piece. -No, thank you. I'm stuffed. I couldn't eat any more. I can't eat any more either. -It's only a small piece. -No. Do it for me. Really, I'm stuffed. How can you do this to me? It's tiny. -Come on, Eduardo. -Ana. Don't force them. Didn't you hear? You're worse than your mom. -I'll have it. -No. You won't. Your heart is fucked. You don't want it, that's it. I'm sick of her getting her way. Sick to death. Carlos? That's enough. -It's just a piece of omelet. -Dad. Leave it, I'm serious. Nobody's eating that piece tonight. Not tonight. No, no, no. Nobody's eating it. Leave it, Dad. If you don't leave it, I'll cut my veins. It's up to you. It's me, or the omelet. Put it down. Put it down slowly, and return it to the plate. I'm sick of it. You're acting so weird. We're here to relax for a few days, it's turning out to be stressful. What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? "That was the best night of my life. Mwah!" That's what's wrong. - What do you mean? -You're messing up, Carlos. What is it? Take it easy. Ana, tell them why I'm like this. Tell my brother and father why. What is it? Don't you want to speak? Is your mouth dry? Do you need some gin and tonics? I don't care who, but I want to know what's going on, right now. As she won't talk, I'll tell you myself. Sit down. On our way here, she was driving so we got lost. I picked up her mobile, it has GPS. Mine's a piece of shit. A message came from her boss. Know what it said? "That was the best night of my life. Mwah!" I said: "Ana, what's this?" Oh my! One of my boss' jokes. Not much of a joke, I certainly didn't find it funny. Before you arrived, I was asking for an explanation. -Did you get one? -She said that -after the convention... -Which? Wednesday, they went to Valencia to a convention... on some sort of crap, selling flats. They went for supper at a Japanese, he paid. Then they had some gin and tonics. You know Ana doesn't drink. Then to the same hotel... and according to my beloved wife, to separate bedrooms, to sleep. -You don't believe her? -No. If it's true, why was it the best night of her boss' life? What shitty nights has he had for that to be the best? It makes no sense. Well, unless her boss is fucking embryo and that was his first night on this fucking planet. Honey, is he a fucking embryo? Or are you lying in front of my family? No. No, Carlos. He's not an embryo. My boss is 62 years old. He's a mature, kind man who invited me to dinner. Then he took me to a lovely bar. We talked about life. He made me laugh, like I haven't in a long time. He took me to the hotel, invited me up to his room and made love to me like nobody ever has before. That's why he said it was his best night, the best night of his life. And to tell you the truth, it's also one of the best nights I can remember. Well. Now her boss' message makes sense. Now it does. Here. You still angry with me? No. He's my son and I'm sorry for him, but I know he's an idiot who paid you no attention. So I guess he had it coming. Honestly, I never understood how a smart, pretty girl like you noticed my son. Whilst I don't regret it... leaving Carlos scares me after so many years. I know he's a jealous, sexist prick, but... he has good things. He makes me laugh. He loves me the way I am. I can't imagine life without him. Were you... ever unfaithful to María? No, never. I had the odd opportunity, but... María was everything to me. She was perfect. I could never have betrayed her and risked losing her. You know? If I had cheated she would have left me. That's for sure. Your relationship was lovely. A 62-year-old mature man. She fucked an old man. Not this... -I'll never get over this. -With time you will. Talk to Ana, there might be a solution. Remember my stag night? It was awesome. Remember when I sucked that stripper's tits? You were really into it. Yes, I remember. I said not to tell anyone, that if Ana found out, she wouldn't marry me. We didn't tell anyone, Carlos. Us guys are very loyal. I know, you didn't tell on me. But I didn't tell you that two days before the wedding, I got an anonymous e-mail. -Anonymous? -Yes, anonymous. Yes, it didn't say who sent it. That's what it means? Thanks. I know what it means, idiot. I opened it. Know what was in it? No, I don't. A photo from Ana's bachelorette party. She was in a nightclub, somewhere dark, with her friends, and our mom. She was wearing a sexy, red dress... Mom was? No, Ana. She was thinner and younger. She was sitting on a chair and there was a stripper, arms around her waist, sucking her tits, covered in cream. He was holding her like a koala. -Who on earth sent you that? -I don't know, Santi. But it really hurt me. On my wedding day, the photo was right here. I couldn't get it out of my mind. It really pissed me off. I almost didn't marry her. But, no. I washed my face, went to church, married her and never mentioned it. But I still haven't forgiven her. But, Carlos, you did the same. You sucked the stripper's tits. But I'm a sexist fucker, it's not as bad. It's just as bad. Just the same. -It is. -Maybe. But it's not. What will happen with Carlos? What do you think? He'll leave you. This is the end of my life as I know it. Only God knows what the future holds. I'm sorry Ana cheated, and you found out this way... But deep down, if I'm completely honest, I feel relieved, I feel better. I hope you're not angry. I love you, Santi. In my ranking of people I love, you were number 3. -Now you're number 2. -And who is number 1? Me. -I love you, too. -How about a toast? To being the most cheated-on brothers on earth. Boys? What, Dad? -Come. -What's with the knife? You killed Ana? Someone's in the house. Follow me. This is all there is. One each, it might get nasty. Shh. Shall we go? -What exactly did you hear? -The flush. -You're sure? -Yes. - Maybe a neighbor? - There aren't any. Has your boss come to visit us? -Don't fuck with me. -Someone else did. There's nobody. I definitely heard it. Someone's there. Told you, someone's in there. -What a shit night. -It makes no sense. -Burglars don't use toilets. -He needs a shit. -He flushed twice. -A big turd. It happens. -Let's call the police. -No. It could be nothing. Nothing? -Who's flushing then? -I don't know... -An animal? -I saw a cat flushing on YouTube. Shall we call the police? I wouldn't. If there's nobody here, they'll arrest us for being idiots. Call the police. -I don't have my phone. -Mine's charging. I think mine's in the kitchen, but I'm not sure. -Go and get it. -Why don't you go? -It's your phone. -What a shitty excuse. Don't make Dad go, you'll be quicker. You're quicker than me, you go. -I'm not faster. -You always have been. -What do you mean? -Shh! This is no time for discussing that. Whoever, but one of you go. We must call the police before whatever's there comes out. You go, you lying bitch. Why someone from my family? Because you're men. Well I never... so you're no longer a fucking feminist? Equality sometimes, others: let the men do it. It's not that I'm a feminist, it's that you're very sexist. Guys. -Come out. -Who are you? Come on. Come here, don't annoy me. -We've no money. -I don't need money. I don't like to shout. Come, I'll explain everything. Why our house? Sure it's yours? -It's borrowed. -It's not yours then. What's his deal? We don't have much time, there's an emotional night ahead. If you could please listen, I'll tell you why I'm here. Who are you? Want to know who I am? I'll tell you. I'll take that glass. I'll pour myself more wine. I'll drink it. Ahh... ...I'll tell you who I am. You see... I'm God. You're God? I'm God. He's a madman. I may be mad, -but not the way you think. -Really? Prove it. Yes, if you're God, you can prove it. It's normal not to believe me. If I do something convincing, will you? If I resurrect one of you, -will you believe me? -Resurrect us? But we're not dead. Not yet. But Granddad could suddenly get chest pains. Right, Granddad? You feel a terrible pain. Great pressure, getting more and more unbearable. As if somebody is crushing your heart. An atrocious pain, which inevitably leads to a cardiac arrest and dropping to the ground... -dead. - Dad. What is it? Eduardo, are you all right? -Perform CPR, I don't know how. -Me neither! Do something! No pulse, he's fading. -Harder, Santi! -I'm doing the best I can! I'll call 911. No need: he's dead. You killed him? You killed my dad? Yes. How? I said who I am. I can do things. -I can kill whoever I want. - Will you resurrect him? -If you can, please do. -Do it, son of a bitch! Guys. Take it easy, there's no need to be rude. Don't piss me off, I could get riled up, and... -Do it and we'll believe. -Can you? Then you'll believe me? Of course, if you can kill and resurrect, we'll believe you. Hey, you. Get me a glass of wine. -What? - A glass of fucking wine! Ahh. Now. Don't look. We can't look? No. I can't believe what has happened tonight. It's like a strange dream. It's not a dream, I assure you. I'm real, and so is this situation. I'd stopped believing in God. I lost the little faith that I had when I lost my wife... Hey, I don't have time for stories about your wife. She was our mom. -How old was she? -Only 66. No spring chicken, I think it was her time. But... what were you doing in our bathroom? You're God, why couldn't you get out? You still have doubts after all that? Do you want to see more of my power? No, that came out wrong. I don't like you much, mate. Here I am and you can only ask that? Ask why the fuck I came here. Come on, ask me. Why the fuck did you come? "Why the fuck..." What a foul mouth. Don't use swear words, fuck! Ask politely. Arsehole! -Why'd you come? -Such a familiar tone? Why, sir, have you come? Perfect. I came to explain something very important. Something which will change history. Tomorrow, humanity will experience the most meaningful moment since its existence, and you... are going to be the key pieces in this change. Us? At dawn, the human species will be extinguished from the earth. Only two people can survive, and you are in charge of choosing who the two survivors will be. I don't understand. I said: "the human species will be extinguished from the earth". Which part didn't you get, son? Everybody will die tomorrow? Everybody, except the two you choose, whose names I need to write in this book, before dawn. But it's very cruel, it's a genocide, the biggest murder in history. It's mad, right? If only two can survive, will two of us die? That's the math, son. Why do we have to choose? I feel like it. Can we save ourselves? Save yourself, save whoever you want. Hold the champagne. You won't be toasting this year. Such a strange New Year's Eve. At least it stopped raining. -What should we do? -Do what he says, no other option. What if we refuse? Didn't you see what he did to me? We can't refuse. Who knows what type of God he is, but he could crush us all. -You really think it was him? -Who else? I don't know if he's God, but I do know he's a son of a bitch. Where is he now? He's a different, cruel God. Why's he a dwarf? That's not in the Bible. And why was he in our toilet? I just don't understand. And why choose us to select the survivors? We're shitty people. I'd like to ask a lot of questions. Why us? What's special about us? Because he feels like it, that was his explanation. If he were nicer and understanding, I would ask him a lot of questions. I always believed in a superior being, but he's so cruel. What are you talking about? Nothing, nothing at all. Nothing? What do you say, when you're talking about nothing? - We were talking... -So you were talking? We were saying that we would like to ask you some questions. Shall I address the conundrums facing humanity? Or you're still wondering about the bathroom? Try to understand, we've had this unique and strange opportunity. -And... -And what? We would like to ask you some questions. Go for it. Mm-hm. I don't know... Ask me one of those great questions to which there is no answer. Is there life after death? You died a while ago. See anything? I don't remember. It was strange. What do you think? I think there's something. Something? Yes, a heaven where we all go when we die. How lovely. A heaven where all dead people go through history. And the animals? Are animals in this heaven, too? I don't know. They're all together in heaven right now. In a huge community of neighbors. That heaven must be the bees knees. According to that theory, everybody is up there. Are they divided into regions? Eras? Religions? Or living together in harmony? Hitler, Gandhi, Christopher Columbus, Elvis, Napoleon... Your wife! Maybe she lives next door to Alexander the Great. How strange. They must all be looking down on us from up there. So there's no heaven? No. There's nothing after death? No. Where's my wife? Right where you left her. And her soul? Her soul? I don't have it. Have you chosen the two people yet? I want the two people! You only have a few hours. If you don't give me the names before sunrise, not even God can save you. So put pen to paper and write down the names of the chosen ones, for fuck's sake! Two of us will be saved, and two will die. We must choose. Hey. You really think he's God and will extinguish humanity tomorrow? Son, he killed me and now I'm alive. -Explain that. -I don't know. Many things have no explanation, like my wife cheating on me with an old man. I believe he's God, or a superior being. -I can tell. -How? That nun's school traumatized you. Maybe he's the devil. That sure would make more sense. -Wouldn't it? -You think he's the devil? Write the person you want to save on these pieces of paper. We'll count the votes, giving us the first one. Then we'll repeat, and find out the second. All right? So you've assumed that one of us must be saved? That's obvious. Want to save your ex? Let's focus, and choose the first survivor. Yes, master. I'll put some music on, to make choosing easier. Either Carlos or Santi, I'm sure of that. Who do I choose? Why is God doing this? Is he God? Is he the... It doesn't matter... Carlos. What's he writing? What are you looking at? I'm not putting you. I'll put myself. Carlos... What about my brother? He's a big softie. My dad's old. And Ana? Idiot, sexist, jealous... he's worthless. What if I leave it blank? I could do that. Selfish, immature... But I can't live without him. Not her... What? You were so hot when we got married. Look at you now. All you do is eat. Marisa and me. Marisa. Marisa. Marisa! -I'm going to make a call. -To whom? -I'm going to... -Who are you going to call? What an idiot. Hello. What is it? I need to talk, it's important. We've nothing to talk about. Stop calling. This is different, Marisa. - Shall we fight, like last time? -It won't be like that. - I'm hanging up. -Just let me ask you a question. - I'm going. -Just one question, Marisa. I'll never bother you again, I promise. Please, it's important for me, for both of us. Fuck. -Marisa... - Santi, stop bothering us. You lost her because she found someone better, I'm younger, better looking, nicer... She's having fun and the best sex ever, anyway... Santi, accept defeat like a man. Keep your chin up, a big hug, ciao. -What are you looking at? -Nothing. Yeah, right. What's wrong? Are you crying? I cried, yes. Marisa. She's dead. I'm happy. You didn't kill her. It is what it is. What's more, nobody who's not here is getting saved. The black guy will die, too. Don't mention him. What black guy? Drop it, Dad. Forget about Marisa and focus on the fucking name. Killing someone instead of saving them? That would be easier. Who would you choose? I've a few people in mind. - I pity you, Carlos. -No, I pity you. It's pitiful. Fucking the first guy who takes you for sushi. Did the guy from your bachelorette party also take you for sushi? -What? -"What?" -You know. -No... Yes, you do. Whatever. I see you won't save me. -I'd rather save your boss. -Stop! You're disgusting me. Time is passing and we still have to rule two of us out. Don't you realize that two of us will die! I don't want to be saved. That's nonsense. I've been thinking, I don't think I could take it. Two people, alone in the world? It would be fun, you and I alone. With cool cars, mansions with pools... We'd go to the cinema, PlayStation on the big screen. Living in the White House, or the Playboy Mansion with girls. The Playmates would be dead, Carlos. Dead. How would we get to America? Would we go by car? Can you fly a plane? Or by boat, are you driving, Captain? -Just trying to cheer you up. -Well, you're doing it wrong. -Really wrong. -Hung up on Marisa? Grow up, this is more important. It's not just Marisa. Not just her, a little, yes... But... Santi, calm down. Write a name. Come on. These two are enough trouble. Don't you get it? Those left will have to create a new generation. We must choose people to perpetuate our species. Worthy people! We're not worthy? I'm not at my best, but I am worthy. -I don't think so. -I'm worthy. I'm fertile, I can have children. You're almost 40, Ana. I'm not worthy? It's a dangerous age to have kids. Do you want to kill us all? Do whatever you want. I cannot and should not be saved. The future of our species is at stake. I don't give a damn about the human race. Not one damn. The planet would be better without us. Only animals and plants. -We're a fucking cancer. -I'm sorry you think that way. I want to live. If I don't like the other life, I'll commit suicide. Like you tried to do before. That was low. Luckily, I think the opposite. I choose to sacrifice myself. You prefer to die? I think so. But I'm much older than you. I'm ill, and I want to live. You must keep hope, fight, try to survive, that's a vital experience which is worth living. Hope is important, Dad. It is. But you shouldn't be so selfish. You don't deserve... You can't... Say what you were going to say. Don't hold back. You're 72 years old, Dad. Your heart is bad. We need younger people. Competent people. A person of your age would mean the end of our species, understand? You'd prefer your father to die. Say it to my face, son. Look at me, and say that you'd prefer that I die. You don't have many years left, you're not an intelligent choice. I would like to save my mom. Your mom? You're joking. -She's younger than him. -We can't choose old people. You agree with your brother? I didn't mean that, I respect your decision. But not mine? Santi's right, we need a fertile woman. Fertile... Carlos, you're infertile and you know it. I didn't expect this from you, you're on fire tonight, but that was unexpected. You're infertile? No, Santi. I don't like kids, they disgust me, that's it... He can't have any. He was tested, and he can't. A depressive, a sick granddad, a sterile who hates kids, and an almost 40-year-old woman who wants to save her mom. The future of humanity isn't looking very promising. Look, I've tried to add common sense to this fucking madness, but it doesn't matter, I'll treat it as a game. Let's play. I have a name. Your turn. Well... The first vote is for... Ana. Thanks, whoever it was. The second vote is for... Carlos. If it's me and her, it won't end well. The third vote is for... Santi. And the last vote is for... What if there's a draw? If it's Eduardo, it's one all. I got one? No. Santi. That's your writing. You didn't vote for me? No. You voted for me? Santi, you're the first survivor. How funny, you chose the one person who didn't want to survive. And I've got one foot in the grave, thanks boys. Now choose another and write it in my book. Will animals survive? He only talked about killing humans. I hope so, because I like cats and dogs. He could kill the fucking spiders. And cockroaches, they're vile. Those fuckers can survive a nuclear explosion. They must have a function on the planet. To disgust, just like you a while ago. It's a logical opinion. You're unbearable sometimes, but you're not really like that. -Like what? -So spiritual. Dreaming of impossible things. Dad has a Catalan word to describe how you are: -Somiatruites. -What's that? One who dreams in omelets. It reminds me of our quarrel about peace, remember? A little. You said there would be world peace one day. No more wars on earth. -I still think so. -I disagreed. Impossible. Humans can never live in peace. It's in their DNA. You said I was wrong, that I was a sourpuss. I kept at it, over and over. What happened next? I smacked you. Your Highness, nothing to add. Men can't live in peace. I think they can, I really do. You're a somiatruites. Say it again, I'll hit you. I love you, bro. I just realized that if that dwarf is God, this might be our last night together. It's unbelievable. Unbelievable. Am I interrupting? You're crying? The onion, Dad. The fucking onion. I love you, sons. Don't ever forget me. Don't say that now, Dad. I won't be able to tomorrow, idiot, I won't be here. He cut himself! He was opening a bottle. Come on! Dad? I'm sorry, ok? For what I said. Sometimes I'm... a bit of a prick. It hurt. You don't even want God to save me. But you're right. I don't deserve to be saved. Forgive my selfishness, and choose wisely between those two. You forgive me? Read it. Those bastards. -Isn't it incredible? -The night has been incredible. I mean, he's obviously a God. He has powers. However... he hurt himself. What do you mean by that? He's vulnerable. We can kill him. You want to kill God? Santi? The sleeping pills? That's a good plan. I'll kill them. I'll kill them. Feeling better? I would save a doctor. -What? -For humans to have a chance, save a young, fertile male doctor, and a young, fertile female doctor. That would be a good choice. Yes, a doctor is vital. Some wine? You must vote. Time is running out, and right now only Santi would be saved. We'll vote now, don't worry. -Want some more wine? -Yes, we have another bottle. You seem nervous. You're being very nice. You haven't poisoned the wine, have you? Poison? No, no... Why would we poison you, we can't kill you. You drink first. It's nice, the other had more body. You, too. I can't drink much with my medicine. I don't like it anyway. Eduardo, you reek of wine. I can smell your breath... ...from here. Drink. Son. Now you drink. What are you doing? You're finishing it! Get another bottle. Go! We'll toast to the night, and to the future ahead of you. He's out. -How are the rest of you? -Fine, for now. And you, Santi? How long do we have before he wakes up? Who knows, I put in all of Santi's pills. He drank the least. Well... sunrise isn't for another two hours. We must kill him now. -Who will? -I can't do it. Me neither. Me. I'll kill him. How will you do it? How will you do it? How will you kill him? It's just you and me. What next? You and me? We'll separate. You fucked up, I won't forgive you. I'll never forget it. -What are you talking about? -You and me. No, what do we do with him. Who's killing him? I don't know, I really don't... Really, you'll never forgive me? A stripper put cream on your tits at your party and ate it in front of mom. -That's not true. -I have a graphic document of that pathetic moment. I think... It's not true. I have photos from your party. He's sucking your tits, Mom's even clapping. Don't lie. I'm sorry, it was my bachelorette party. I'd had a lot to drink. Because of that nonsense, I almost didn't marry you. And I also sucked a dirty stripper's tits. So what's the problem? Fine. Let's suppose I forgive you, which I won't... Imagine we forgive each other and are a very happy couple. When I made love to you, kissed you, even for a second, I'd see your boss groping you. I couldn't live like that. -You don't even know him. -I don't forgive you. It was the best night of his life. It's best that we separate. -In extraordinary circumstances? -Like what? If it's just you and me. -That won't happen. -Why? We're going to kill that dwarf now and save humanity, even your fucking boss. How do we do it? I don't know. Thrust the sword through his heart? -Or split his skull? -Shall I do that? Decapitate him. Let's see... Split his skull, through the heart or decapitation. Which? We need to decide now. -I don't know how to kill. -Me neither, fuck! -Then do all three. -All three? Yes, open his skull first, decapitate him, and through the heart to finish. Then set him alight? Yes, we could burn him. We need to kill him. Not open a butcher's. -Carlos, there's no time! -Come on. I'll decapitate him and that's that. It's safest, he can't live headless. Yes, that's best. So help me God... Help me... -What are you doing? -Again! Go on, Carlos! -Again! -What? Are you crazy? Dad! Don't flee, bastard. Let's talk, mate. -About what? -Don't cut me anymore, please. What is this? Don't end humanity, leave the earth, it's a shit-hole, but leave it. What? Humanity? Don't listen, Carlos. He's God, he can kill us. Do I look like God? I'm a fucking bum. What about my dad? What do you mean? I don't know your father, or you. I'm a bum. He's lying, Carlos. Let your guard down, he'll kill us. Stab him again, it's almost dawn. Look at me. Tell me what you see. Do I look like God. Don't listen. He has great power. He's having you on. No! I'm not God. I'm a bleeding man who needs you to call for an ambulance. He's God. He wants to annihilate us. If I were, I wouldn't be bleeding like a fucking rat. Jesus was God, and he bled on the cross. Jesus wasn't God, Jesus was the son of God. How can you believe that fucking story? But he bled. He wasn't God. Are you Jesus? I've no time to discuss religion right now. I'm atheist anyway. I don't believe in any of that. Help me. God's an atheist. Call an ambulance, I beg you. He can't just be a tramp, it can't be true. What can't be true, is you thinking a guy like me is God. You're... You're... You're mentally ill. Carlos, look at me. Look at me. Kill him. It's almost dawn, there's no time. Guys. Guys, listen to me. I don't know what I'm doing here, I don't remember anything. I'm not God. I was putting you on. I'm sorry. A thousand times, I'm sorry. I was only joking. I'm a bum... nothing more. I swear. I don't deserve this. What's your name? My name is... Carlos... García Vidal... I have my ID in this pocket. Hands still! I'm only getting my ID. One move, and I'll tear your head off. Yes! I'm God, so step aside or I'll break you. Don't worry, we'll call a doctor. He'll be all right. There, decapitated. -But... -But what? We killed God, and saved the human race. And that's that. Here's the fucking hand. Ana? His name is Carlos García Vidal. From Tarazona. Ana. We're murderers, Ana. We killed a simple man. Carlos, would a bum put us through the worst night of our lives? Are we that stupid? That man is God, or something, but he had powers. I'm not sure. What's for sure, is that this nightmare is over. He's dead. We're alive. There's a headless corpse there, you think it's over? Fine, fine, I'll call the police. I'll explain, they'll understand. What's there to explain? We killed a dwarf bum. What the fuck? And how undignified, we cut off his head. And look. My dad is one-handed. There are four witnesses. -We all have the same version. -They're doped and asleep. We're murderers. Especially you. Especially me? That's what you think? -Really? -I slashed him once. You cut off his head. Very well, will you report me? No, I'm just saying what happened. Carlos. A lot of shit went down tonight. Right? Please. Can you leave bad feelings aside? We're a team. Carlos... We've been together for years. It's not our best moment, I know that. I understand. I know that I have hurt you. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. We must unite on this. Can you put problems aside, please? Let's get on, until dawn. Fine. We'll wait until dawn. Nothing weird will happen, so we'll clean this up, bury the dwarf, wake these two up, and on Monday, we'll go to the lawyer to get a divorce. Deal? Deal. Do we have ice? Dad? Dad? Carlos? Carlos? Carlos? Ana? Carlos? Carlos? Carlos? Carlos? Carlos? Ana?
