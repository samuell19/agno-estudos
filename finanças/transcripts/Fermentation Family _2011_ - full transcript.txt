Brought to you by WITH S2 Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad Episode 12 I'm in front of the kids, keep your promise. Come. Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on. Come on. Come on. Stop! Don't move! You're all being arrested for committing a crime in front of a police officer! You're exactly the same as you were ten years ago. Isn't it time for you to remove yourself from such affairs? Let's talk. Sunbaenim! See if Lee Jung Woo's okay. Alright. Are you okay? Dong Soo. Yes? Yes, hyungnim. Escort Lee Jung Woo to his home safely. Yes. Good bye, hyungnim. What's going on? Escort him home safely. Of course. No! How can you trust him? Don't worry. Sunbaenim! Hurry, go. Yes. What happened? Just get in. Those bastards committed a crime in front of an officer! You and I are police officers! And? We have to arrest them! We should have arrested them! Even if we take them in for questioning, the longest we can keep them for is a day. And during that day, after giving them a few meals and letting them go to the bathroom, it all comes to an end. There's a victim! Gi Ho Tae will be of no use to us anyway. And Lee Jung Woo will sue. Because it's obvious those bastards will threaten his family. You knew that and yet... Say that we actually do succeed in putting them in jail. Even if we do, they'll be out in a month. Why would you do such a thing? If you want to put them away, you need to do it right. What did you talk about with him? I know very well what you're thinking, but you just need to trust me. If you can't trust me, then report me. Sunbae... Go to the nearest hospital. I don't need to go to a hospital. Just drop me off anywhere. Even after that beating, your mouth is still alive. Whatever. Who cares if something happens? What are you doing? It's past twelve. You haven't been contacted by Ho Tae-gun, right? You're waiting for Gi Ho Tae? He looked like he was in a hurry before. He won't even pick up his phone. Surely nothing bad has happened, right? He must be meeting his friends or something. You must be tired, go in and sleep. He'll be back soon. I'm not even sleepy anymore. Don't worry about me, you should go in. I said to let me off. Can't you see we're on a bridge? What are you going to do? Jump and drown yourself? If so, I'm going to go right to the police station instead of the hospital. That would actually be better. Why do you keep speaking informally to me? And if I saved you from death, shouldn't your first order of business be to thank me? People don't die that easily. You'll die like that. Even bravery should have its limits. What were you thinking, going there by yourself. And why were you there? I'm not a good guy, but I don't think you're a good detective either. Were you following me? It's a long story. Go to Chun Ji In. Not to the hospital? Seeing as how he's yapping about, it doesn't look like we need to go to a hospital. There's some place I need to visit. Gi Ho Tae! When are you going to tell us the reason, you're digging through the Woo Tae Bok incident? It would be faster to find out yourself. If you change your mind, call me. {\a6}*dongchimi is a type of kimchi generally consisting of radishes in a brine. [Oh Hae Joon] ["father"] [Kimchi Recipes] [scallion kimchi] [godeulppaegi kimchi] {\a6}*made from seaweed, radishes, and gardenias [persimmon kimchi] [cabbage kimchi] [citron dongchimi] [chija miyeok roll kimchi] [The mail has been successfully sent.] Oh my goodness! I was surprised. You still weren't sleeping? Do you have something to say to me? Would you like to have some makgeolli? I don't think I can fall asleep anyway. Why don't we have some makgeolli and wait together? You can't hold your liquor very well. I'm going to learn how to, and become closer to you. Weren't we already friends? I want to become closer, much more than we are now. What are you doing there? Oh, Unni. Why are you awake? I had a bad dream. What kind of dream? Stay right there! Don't move. What's happened? What happened to your face? Ahjussi... What are you doing here? You know him? He's the one who saved your life. What? Saved my life? What are you talking about? When you first came to our house... Why is your face like that? Did you get into a fight again? What happened to your face? You're bleeding! He's bleeding, Kang San! You need to go to a hospital. He needs to go to a hospital, Kang San, Ho Tae-gun is very hurt. It's nothing. Explain yourself. What's going on here? How long are you going to keep on like that? How old are you that you're still getting into fights? And if you're going to fight, you shouldn't have gotten hit and won! Why do you go around getting hit? Why are you getting angry at someone who's hurt? He's making me angry! Go to the hospital! I'm fine. What do you mean, you're fine! You're injured everywhere! You're a complete mess! You have to go to the hospital. I'm going to get my car keys, so just wait here. It only looks bad, it's nothing. I'll be fine after a night's sleep. Fine, do whatever you want! Where are you going? You all seem busy, so I was going to quietly go. What are you doing here? I told you last time. You can come whenever you're hungry. So why are you sneaking around? Because I feel bad. The boss isn't here, and there's a rumor that the Chun Jin In is ruined. You came because you were hungry? We're not going to become bankrupt. Don't worry and come whenever you want. And don't sneak in without us knowing! Sorry. {\a6}*ssam is a type of roll or wrap) Then you were the one who ate the kimchi ssam rice as well? I'm sorry. Don't worry, it's perfectly fine. Wait just a moment! I'll serve you at once! No, it's okay! I'll be going. Ahjussi! Who is he? He stays at the abandoned secondhand store nearby. Whenever Kang San came home, she'd always send him food and makgeolli. A secondhand store? Ahjussi! Damn... How did he save my life? If he hadn't called us, you would've been dragged away that day. By chance... are you talking about the first day I came here? Yes. It's a relief I was passing nearby, what would've happened if I wasn't there? What a weird ahjussi. Why did he call you and not the police? Women don't even have any strength. I guess he doesn't like the police, like you. Plus, you should throw away that prejudice that women don't have strength. Men may fight with strength, but women fight with their brains. Move! Does it hurt? Does it hurt? You have some salve, right? I don't! Is it true that it was your birthday yesterday? I don't know. I decided the day I left the orphanage as my birthday. So yesterday, was that day? Yeah. What do you mean, you're fine! No part of you isn't injured! You're a complete mess! What are you doing up? You woke up because of all the noise? The secondhand store ahjussi ate the kimchi ssam rice. He must've done so because he was hungry. It's late. Do this tomorrow and go to sleep. I can't sleep. I worry about where and how father is getting along in this cold weather. For some strange reason I keep feeling uneasy. Surely, something bad didn't happen to dad, right? Of course not. If you keep thinking about bad things, bad things will actually happen, so I'm only going to think positively. But I still haven't figured out the problem. Neither Kang San nor I can figure out why he sent us the scallion twice. Stop thinking such complicated thoughts. Hurry and go back in. After I finish this. Listen to me. It's not good to show customers that you're tired. Go in and get some rest. I've been curious about this for a while, but have you ever gotten married? You haven't gotten married even once until now? I'll keep your secret. The... the moment a secret comes out of your mouth, is when the secret is no longer a secret. I'm confident I can keep your secret safe. And besides, family shouldn't have secrets amongst ourselves. I don't have any secrets from you. From now on, if you ever get into another fight, be prepared to hand in your resignation. You say that all the time. That's because you always get into trouble. Here. Promise Are you a kid? I'm worse than a kid. Hurry! Hurry! Fine, I won't fight. If you're lying, I'm going to cut your salary. Or I'm going to cancel your board and lodging. It doesn't matter if you look at me like that, I haven't done anything wrong. What are you doing? Beautiful Kang San ... going to get destroyed because of me. Does Lee Kang San have medicinal hands? I feel all better. It's strange... What is? Done. Here. How is it? It's good. Really? Is it someone's birthday today? The menu for today is the same one mom served on dad's birthday. I was going to tell you anyway. Why are you here? Does it hurt? Oh... This? It's nothing, it doesn't hurt at all. It looks painful. Wow. Because of you, I'm all better now! Thanks. They said breakfast is served. Alright. Why isn't Ho Tae-gun coming? Hurry up! Today we actually have white rice, hurry and sit. You too, Eun Bi. Yes. It's nothing. He got very hurt. He should gone to the hospital, but he was so stubborn that we didn't go. {\a6}'miyeok-gook', seaweed soup, is generally served on someone's birthday) And today isn't any special day, we just decided to make miyeokgooks. Alright, let's eat. Is it good? Out of all the miyeokgook's I've had in my life, this is the most delicious I've had. So cold! Why is it so cold? It's cold because it's winter, why are you saying such obvious things? Welcome. Right. Hey, what happened to your face? It just turned out that way. Did you get into a fight again? By any chance, the boss's DNA testing... Woah! This miyeok-gook is so delicious! Wow, this miyeok-gook really does look delicious. But... is it someone's birthday today? No! Yes. Lee Kang San... Oh! Yes, hello. I know it's not courteous to do so, but I asked the owner of the restaurant for your phone number. If you have some time tonight, I was wondering if you'd come to our house and have dinner. I have something to take care of then... but what is this about? I'd really appreciate it if you could come. Truthfully... Oh, really? Alright. Even if it's late, I'll be there. You have to keep the secret, alright? What kind of secret is that? You don't need to keep that a secret. Still, please keep it a secret. If he finds out beforehand, it won't be as fun. Alright, alright. But secrets are meant to be uncovered. If the secret gets out, I'm going to blame it on you. - What secret? - Oh my goodness! How much did you hear? Something about a secret getting out. What is it? Is it a secret that only I don't know? What are you talking about? There is no secret. You just... Did you finish cleaning? You didn't just half-heartedly do it, did you? You can check if you want. If I find that it's unsatisfactory, I'm going to reduce your salary, so be prepared! - And if I pass? Are you going to give me a raise? - What big dreams you have... Are you two dating? You two sound like you're having a lover's quarrel. Lover's quarrel? Ahjussi, that's ridiculous! Right, that is ridiculous. How dare you pair her up with him! You're not the one who should be talking. Shut your mouth! Don't you dare set your sights on Kang San. I'll never allow it! Don't you worry! Lee Kang San isn't my type anyway. Aren't you going to check my cleaning? I will! And you aren't my type either! There's definitely something going on there. Don't say such ridiculous things. Massage my hand, I haven't been able to digest well lately. Should I get you some maeshil tea? Yeah, bring some out. The director of this place only disappeared last night, so it's still too early to call it the work of the serial kidnapper, right? If it's his doing, a video will arrive. It looks like it's true that the director assaulted the residents here. This is going to be a pain. What about the press? The ones in authority are probably blocking it, after all, it still hasn't been verified. Hey, hey, hey! Wait, wait a second. By any chance, did you hear anything last night? You're police officers, right? Is it true that the director was kidnapped by Hong Gil Dong? You little... I asked first! I didn't hear anything. Really? What happened to your face? I wish he wouldn't appear again. Who? The director. I wish Hong Gil Dong would send him far away. The kimchi-ahjussi says that no one starts out evil, but I don't believe that. The director was always evil. Who's the kimchi-ahjussi? You don't need to know. The internet has made a serial kidnapper into a hero. This world has so many bad guys. There are even policemen who let the bad guys go in front of their eyes. Yeah, Gi Ho Tae? By any chance, can I see a picture of Woo Tae Bok from twenty years ago? Why? I won't tell you the reason now. Do you have it or not? With your skills, you should be able to find it yourself. I'm asking because I can't find it. I'm not positive, but if I look, I'll probably be able to find it. If you find it, will you be able to show me? It won't be difficult to just show you a picture. Woo Tae Bok? Secretary Woo? Is that true? Yes, they still haven't been able to find the culprit. Wow, that's amazing. But then... what's the reason Ho Tae is digging up information about Woo Tae Bok? I don't know. Hey, get some able guys together and find out. This is getting pretty interesting. And... about Oh Myung Cheol... What? What is it? Tell me, does he have a woman or something? The daughter. Up until a few years ago she was Jung Hyun Sook's, most favored apprentice at her kimchi research institute. And now she's independent and runs her own cooking school. The President is asking for you. Don't you know how to greet people? With this, end it cleanly. He's a petty man, so it may get a little noisy. Please don't worry. I know I should've called on you, but since you've just experienced such unfortunate events, I was hesitant to go to your home. You did well. Because you sent a driver, I was able to get here comfortably. Let's get through with the talks quickly. My wife is sick, so I can't leave her alone for long. Alright. {\a6}jeotgal - fermented foods I'm asking that you hand over your cave and all the jars of jeotgal you have in there. Because they are of the finest quality, I'll be willing to give you as much as you'd like. You've continued the work of generations of your predecesors, so I know it won't be an easy decision. I will give you time to think it over, so take your time and... There's no need. Because of that jeotgal, I've lost my own son. I no longer have any wish to continue and there's no need to think it over. Then... shall I take it that you've made your decision? I'd like to request one thing. Out of all the jeotgal I have, I'd like to give a part of it to Chun Jin In. They've made kimchi for decades using only our jeotgal. Then, I'll take that as a yes and be on my way. We're also a company that makes kimchi. This precious jeotgal may be the last of its batch, and I do not want to share it with the Chun Jin In. So that it doesn't give you any inconvenience, Handol Foods will take special care to make our own kimchi. So you're saying the offer won't stand if I don't hand over everything. That's correct. If that's what you want, it can't be helped. I'll do that then. Thank you. What do you mean? Up until now we've... Mr. Heo, Mr. Heo! What is it? It was from Mr. Heo in Gwang Cheon. He said he wouldn't be able to give us any more jeotgal and hung up. I don't understand why he's suddenly dropping this in our laps. There was talk that he may sell his cave, looks like it's true. It's been handed down for three generations, why would he sell that? More than anyone else, he has a lot of affection for that cave. He lost his son due to a recent car accident. It's probably because of that. Kang San, it's all ready. Alright, I'll be right there. The kimchi we make today, {\a6}fermented shrimp may be the last batch we make using Mr. Heo's saewoojeot. Did you wash all the scallions that dad sent? There was too much so I left some. And we still haven't solved the problem dad left with us. It's the same with me. And the saewoojeot... This is the last of it, we need to order more. I know. Shall we start? Yeah. Scallions never grow apart from each other. They all grow together, in groups of five or six. And scallion kimchi tastes the best when they're wrapped in bundles of five or six. When scallions are all separated, they become part of the seasoning, but when they're wrapped like this, they become kimchi. Interesting, right? We're like a family. You're right. You may find yourself facing hardships alone, but when families get together, they become invincible. It's because Ho Tae-ahjussi went off by himself that he got himself beaten up. Then we should all band together and scold those who hurt Ho Tae-ahjussi. Then our Eun Bi should become the jeotgal girl. What's that? Scallion kimchi is seasoned with jeotgal, so the jeotgal is very important. You can't see it with your eyes, but they are scallion's best friend and family. You're Ho Tae-ahjussi's best friend and the one who gives him the most strength, so you're the jeotgal-girl. All done. What's wrong? Did we leave something out? Unni, I'm going to Gwang Cheon for a bit. I told you I could go by myself, why are you following along? I'll do what I want. Do you always do whatever you want? Yeah. But why are you suddenly going to Gwang Cheon? If father were here, he'd definitely go see him. Even before I was born, Chun Jin In's kimchi was made with the saewoojeot from Mr. Heo. This scallion kimchi may be the last batch, though. I didn't get a taste before, you want to try too? You're bored because it's winter vacation, right? Should I make you something good? No. Do you not like me? I guess you don't. No. Then, do you like me as much as Ho Tae? I shouldn't have asked that. Sorry. I've never had that much popularity. And I don't have a lot of friends. Why did you run away last time? Run away? When? Last time, I saw you run away when the president-ahjumma came. I didn't! Why would I run away? That never happened. You must've been mistaken. You're going to get a cold, go back in. You're going in there? Mr. Heo is in here. Let's wait until he comes out. You don't know when he's going to come out, how can I wait? Let's just wait! What's wrong with you? By any chance... are you claustrophobic? No, I'm not! Then what's wrong with you? If you go in here, you'll be able to taste the saewoojeot. The taste of the saewoojeot is determined by the cave. And Mr. Heo's cave is the best in our country. It maintains the optimal temperature and humidity, and you get direct winds from the west coast so it's also cool. They're the best conditions for fermenting jeotgal. You should start your own jeotgal business. Mr. Heo! You came quickly. You knew I would come? Like father, like daughter. I heard you'd be here, so I came this way. Are you Lee Gi Chan's future son-in-law? No. He's new at Chun Jin In. Hello, my name's Gi Ho Tae. There's no need for greetings. Today will be the last we see of each other anyway. He died in a car accident on his way to the trial. Someone crossed over the lanes and ran into my son's car. But it looks like he just ran away. After sending away my only son like that, life has no meaning anymore. And my wife is devastated. It's all my fault. I shouldn't have forced my son into this business, when he didn't want to so much. I should have just let him do what he wanted. What's so important about saewoojeot? It's all useless. I know it's not the right thing to do when I think of your parents, but it can't be helped. I'm going to hand over all the remaining saewoojeot over to Handol Foods. You've decided to sell the cave and the saewoojeot to Handol Foods? I want to provide my daughter-in-law and grandson with a comfortable life. And now, there's no one to keep watch over the cave. You need to be able to move a 250 kg barrel over to the cave, and no young people want to do that. And I can't do it myself. I'm sorry for how things have turned out. I understand. But, could you think it over again? I know the caves are as precious to you as your own children. If you don't have them by you, it'll cause you even more pain. You can hire people to do the heavy manual work. And if we can help in any way, we'd be willing to do anything. I've already made up my mind. It really is the last batch of kimchi. It's not as if you can't make kimchi because you don't have their saewoojeot. No one can replicate Mr. Heo's saewoojeot. Now we won't be able to eat it again. What the... What are you doing? I can't just leave like this. Please say yes. I won't change my mind because of this. I'm not trying to change your mind. I just want to do it. If it were my father, he would surely have done the same thing. These are foods that have all been seasoned using your saewoojeot. I hope you enjoy it. Thank you so much for all you've done. They'll be waiting, I told them I'd be back early. I called them and told them that because of Lee Kang San's meddling that we'd be late. Kang San! I just got a phone call and someone has seen your father at Nam Dang Port. - Our father? - Yeah. He's here? He might be. Someone saw him at the jeotgal market. Where is this person who saw my father? What the heck? We've wasted it on some random person. What did I say? I told you we should've taken a close look at his face before doing it! Did I? Or did I not? The only people who'd come at this hour is Kang San and Ho Tae-gun so I thought it was them. It's okay, we still have some more party poppers left. But who is he? Ho Tae-gun's friend. You were surprised, right? No... I was the one shocked. This old man's heart was thumping like mad. You were shocked, weren't you? Everything young people do nowadays is like this. They can't do anything right. It's fun though. I like all the excitement and clamor. Oh, really? You said you had more left, right? Yes. Let's pull some more! Excuse me? If you pull them now, we'll have none left when Ho Tae comes. Save them and use them later. Be quiet. Use them now! She says it's fun. You should do it at an important moment. But why aren't they here yet? It's past time they arrived. You're right. They'll be here soon. Eun Bi, why don't you sing a song? Yeah, grandma's here, so do your best. It's okay. The white fog rides over the ridge of the mountain. At the sound of the rooster we wake from our sleep. From the thatch-roofed house white smoke arises. And a day in the country starts. Father! Father! Father! No matter how hard I think about it, I don't understand. I've thought about it, and then thought about it some more. And I still don't understand what father is thinking. What really makes me sad, is that I don't understand my father. If he was having a hard time, he should've said something. He could have told us. But why... Why is he wandering about all alone? I'm really... so sad. I'm so sorry... to father. I'm really so sorry. Looks like you've had a hard time. You've really had a hard time. It's late... but happy birthday. It's warm. It's warm.

Eat up. - Aren't you drinking too much? - I'm fine. Let's do the wave! I'll start first. Do you feel okay? I'm fine. I think it's best if you quit drinking. - Did I do something wrong yesterday? - You don't remember? Why does he have no strength? Did he get into a fight? Is he going to get a divorce? Why are you so sure that Woo Tae Bok is involved? His comrades are in hiding. Find them. You've done well. - And now this is good bye? - You've made too many mistakes. I thought he was a devoted husband. But he has a young girlfriend. I need to know why you're digging around the Woo Tae Bok incident. I'm looking for my family. He's looking for who? What did you just say?
