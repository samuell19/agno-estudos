Ok. Fine. You. Yes. I'm perfectly composed. Ok. I'll take this. What? You, too. Hmm. Who is this? My parents. Oh. Are they still alive? Ha ha. Oh, yes. Were you planning to do more work on this one? Um. Yes... I'd like to. Actually, I was planning to. I have some sketches, if you'd like to see them. Yes, I would. Oh, they're lovely. Very sensitive. Hmm. Thank you. Was this at the exhibit I saw at Pratt? Yes, it was. Yes, I thought I remembered it. These are nice. Very nice. If you could finish this one, and perhaps a few new paintings, I would be interested. I have an opening in September, as I mentioned. Um, I could do that. Yes, I could be ready. Gardner! Gardner! Gardner! Where the hell are you? Are you out there? Gardner! Gardner! Gardner! I'm here, Fanny! Don't bellow across the entire lake! Can you hear me? I can hear you. Gardner, can you hear me? Ha ha. Yes, I can hear you. Quiet down! What are you doing out here? Hiding from you, Fanny. Gardner church, come in off that water. You've got to come home with me and organize your study! Start packing your books and papers. There are papers all over the house! And we've got guests coming for dinner tonight. Oh, that's right. I forgot. Who'd you invite? Anybody interesting? Just a few friends, gar. Oh, that's too bad. I don't like you out here alone. I do my best thinking on water. You do just fine on land. You're quite a cupcake, you know that? Oh, damn! There goes progress. The papers go into the carton, darling... Not on the floor. Gardner? You haven't said anything about my hat. Gardner? It's very nice. You're not even looking at it. I saw it before. Why didn't you comment on it? You don't think it's too much? No, it's just fine. How much do you think it cost? Fanny, listen to this. "The mules that angels ride "come slowly down the blazing passes from beyond the sun. "Descension of their tinkling bells arrive. These muleteers are dainty of their way." Ha ha ha. Don't you just love that? "These muleteers are dainty of their way." Yes, I love it. How much do you think the hat cost? About $2o? You can't get anything for $2o! $5o. This happens to be a designer hat. $1oo. It's French! Lilia dache. 2oo bucks. 85 cents! I found it in a thrift shop! Ha ha ha. What are you doing here? I left a carton. Some of my music. Why didn't you call? I tried all day long. You were out. I'm sorry to be here without calling you. Um... I might get a show at a gallery in September. That's good. I'm glad. She liked that picture I started of my folks. Remember that one? I'm thinking about going home to finish painting it. What do you think? I don't know, mags. Bye, Andre. Bye, mags. Take care of yourself. Weren't you in Pakistan recently? Oh, he means Afghanistan. Bamiyan. That's near kabool. Kabul. Precisely. The Turkey hash is delicious. Yeah? It tastes like styrofoam to me. I never have been able to cook. Not true. It's quite tasty. I'm sorry we all have to sit around like this. I sold the dining room set. They offered such a good price, I didn't want to wait. Even for tonight's dinner. This is delightful. There are two magnificent buddhas there. One from the third century. The other from the fifth century. That's fascinating! Tell US more. Since when have you been interested in bamiyan buddhas? It was the most spiritual visit we've ever had. We spent time in the caves where the monks used to live. They took vows of silence for years. I wonder if I could do that? Perhaps you should try. Ha ha ha ha! Perhaps we should wash up now. When do we start this packing party? Isn't that what we're here for? This is one of the more unusual dinner parties we've attended in a while. At least I fed you first. What are friends for? They pack up everything after you're dead. Why not when you can still appreciate it? Anyway, movers are so clumsy. So who are these buttons who bought your house? They're from Baltimore. They, uh-- he's in pharmaceuticals. This is second marriage for her. They have two small children. She's a bit too thin. How's your darling mags doing? Painting her little heart out. She says she likes living in New York. You know mags. She's always had her own individual tastes. I was always sorry she and bartel never got together. They would've made a nice pair. We could have been grandparents together. For years we've been trying to mate her with a member of the intelligentsia. So far, no luck. She seems to prefer exotic types. If she'd gone on that bamiyan trip with Charles and Amelia, she probably would have found her own true goatherd. [Laughter] Has bartel been seeing anyone since his divorce? Not that I'm aware of. We're going to miss you. We're going to miss you both. Cotuit's not that far away. You'll all come and stay with US, won't you? Of course, we will. That's what I was afraid of. Oh-ho-ho! I suppose I should call mags and tell her we have to be out of here in a couple of weeks. Invite her for Memorial Day weekend. Yes, I must remember to do that. It was a nice evening, wasn't it? Yes. Bradley has Addison's disease, doesn't he? I thought he had hodgkin's disease. That's pate baldman. Bradley has Addison's. Goat Davis has Parkinson's. I haven't heard of the goat in ages. How is he? He's got Parkinson's. I thought the goat had Addison's. You're right! You're absolutely right! Sammy bishop has Parkinson's. Who's Sammy bishop? Didn't he run for the State Senate or something? I'm not sure we actually know Sammy bishop. Well, he's definitely got Parkinson's. Ha ha ha ha! I'm gonna miss all these old sick people. They'll come to see US in cotuit. Ha ha ha ha. We'll enjoy cotuit. It's a passage. It's a beginning. A romantic cottage for two... Second honeymoon. Yes... Perhaps. Good night, sweet gar. Good night, Fanny. [Telephone rings] [Ring] [Ring] Gardner! [Ring] [Ring] Gardner! Gardner, can you hear me? What is it, Fanny? What's wrong? The bloody phone's ringing! [Ring] I'm in the middle of writing a quite excellent poem! Could you answer it, darling? [Ring] [Ring] [Ring] Oh, god. [Ring] Hello? Hello? Oh! Hello! Oh! Who was that, my dear? Oh, they hung up. How's the poem? What poem? The one you were just working on. Are you going to re-read every book before packing it? I'm going to try. How on earth do you expect me to get US packed up and out of here on time? Who the hell is that? I don't believe it. Is that mags?! Mags? It is! It's mags! Mags is here! Magsy! Hello! Hello, magsy! Ah! Thank you. What a treat! Hi, mother! Daddy, how are you? Splendid! Splendid! All the better for seeing you. To what do we owe this wonderful surprise? What is all this paraphernalia? I want to finish that portrait of the two of you. I need you to sit for me because there's a good chance I might have my own show. Bravo! What have you done to your hair? It's a weird color. I put a rinse in it. I think it looks nice. No one in our family has red hair. Let's go. Gardner, put that down. Isn't it about... Cocktail time? Right. To celebrate mag's arrival! You betcha! What is going on around here? We sold the house! When?! Last month. And we got a pretty good price for it, too. Why didn't you tell me? We were going to call you. I don't... I just can't... Mags, darling. I thought you'd be pleased for US. Where are you moving to? To where are we moving? To cotuit. To the summer cottage. Why? There's no point in having this big house. It's too large, too expensive. Too difficult to manage. You didn't even let me know! But I never thought it would make such a difference to you. I think I'll just go upstairs for a while, up to my room... If it's still my room! Hi, Mrs. Church! How are you? Oh, I'm splendid, thank you. I don't have to tell you how hectic moving can be. Yes, it's an exhausting endeavor. Especially when the date is coming upon US so soon. Yeah. Yes! I was just preparing my garden for you. Now, there are some things you should know. These impatiens are very, very sensitive. If you give them too much water, they'll shrivel up like little prunes. But if you sprinkle them every third day and feed them once a month, they'll reward you with color and abundance. Mrs. Church... On the other hand, these daisies are another matter. No matter how much you cut them back, they'll grow exactly the way they want. Very much like my daughter. Mrs. Church, do you think we could get in the house? There's something we need to decide about the upstairs. Certainly. Follow me. We need to confer about the second bedroom. Anyway, it's time for my daughter to get up. Hello! My daughter's an artist. She sleeps late. Oh, ha ha! Hello, mags! Are you in there? Are you decent? Mmm, what? This is Mr. and Mrs. Buttons and their children. This is my daughter, Margaret, from New York. How do you do? Hope we didn't wake you? No. We could definitely do it. It'll work out fine! Ha ha ha! [Knock knock knock] Who's there? Who's there? Who's knocking? We'll break through the large bedroom, make one huge master suite. Break through? Why would you want to do that? We want the upstairs to ourselves. The children will be downstairs. It'll be your house. You can do whatever you like, as long as you treat my garden well. Yoo-hoo, gardner. You remember the buttons? Oh, yes. How are all of you? Family alert! Family alert! We must accelerate our packing process! Oh, darling. Listen. I'm sorry you were piqued about our moving. It would have been fun having you here with the bidding back and forth, the people traipsing in and out. Daddy and I didn't want to interfere with your things in New York. We didn't want to be any kind of burden to you. All is forgiven? I wanted to be consulted, that's all. I lived here, too. From now on, we consult you on everything! Deal? Mmmmm. Will you help US pack? Go upstairs. Pack up your old things. Take whatever you want back to New York. When will you and daddy sit for me? Oh. There's all this packing to do. Mother. Daddy's poem. I don't even know if he's written it yet. Mother! I'll tell you what. Let's take these things to Alice's, get some good prices, and then we'll come back and pose for you to your heart's content. You can't be serious. Some of these things are very expensive. This didn't exactly come from Macy's basement. It's very beautiful, but we won't get more than five bucks for it. What about this? What about it? It's my husband's. He blotted his poetry with it. He's a poet laureate. Mmmm. $1o. This is preposterous! What happened to the nice woman that used to work here? Oh. She moved to Florida. I've been coming here for years and... Ah! Isn't this divine?! Mags, come here and take a look at this. Isn't it wonderful?! Oh, it is. It's sweet. But, mother, we should get going. I don't want to lose daylight... I must have it. I thought you wanted to get rid of things. But, it's perfect for cotuit. How much? $3o. Why do you continue to insult my sense of value? You offer me $1o for a brass ink blotter and then want to charge $3o... $25. $17.5o is all I'll pay. $2o. Sold. Let's go, mags. You do realize we're leaving here with more than we came with? Don't we have some painting to do? How long are we supposed to sit like this? It's agony. You're doing fine. Just fine. It's so immobile. Don't move. You can have a break soon. I'm rather enjoying it. I wonder if we look distinguished enough. I think we do. You should really wear your tuxedo, gar. And I'll wear my marvelous long black dress that makes me look like that fascinating woman in the sargent painting. You are perfect the way you are. Whatever you say. Gar, would you like a little nip? Yes. Don't move! We're taking a break soon. Mother! Coming! Your mother's a devil. That's one for you. And one for me. Come on. Come on. Ha ha ha. To our cottage in cotuit. To our cottage in cotuit. Why are we moving to cotuit? The question should be why are we sitting here like cardboard figures? Mother. Please! I need you to sit still! [ Whispering ] Give it a try. American gothic by Grant wood. Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Listen. Listen, both of you! I have to complete this painting. I want it to be in the show. We're so happy you have a one-woman show. What's the name of the gallery? Marissa pindar. I never heard of it. It's a small gallery, but it has an excellent reputation. Excuse me, mags. I have to tell daddy something. No, go on. Go on. Come on. I'll give it a whirl. Guess who we are. The pieta. Have you ever seen a better pieta? Ha ha ha! Come on, mags! Can I ask you to resume the pose for five minutes! I'm just asking for five minutes. Please, wash the vegetables while daddy runs to the store. Mother, no! Will you stay here? We'll pose more later. Ok. Why don't we take a break? Remember when we used to peal the vegetables into little animals? Ha ha ha. You always made little bears. Hello. I'm back. Oh, good. Where are the Lima beans? What Lima beans? And what's this? Why did you buy this, gardner? Didn't you ask me to buy that? Well, I guess maybe I did. In the meantime, would you please go back to the store and get the milk and Lima beans for lunch. Sure. Um--I'll go with daddy. I could really use your help here. I'd like to go with daddy. Usually we have cooler weather this time of year. It rained all last week in New York. It's so nice to have you here, mags. When was the last time you were here? Christmas time! Remember... The boswingers were here from London. We all went out caroling and we sang oh Tannenbaum in Harmony. Oh, that was a lovely Christmas. How's your poetry coming, daddy? How do you feel you're writing lately? In spurts. Drips and drabs. The muse doesn't sit on my shoulder the way it used to. Although, wordsworth wrote better the older he became. I'm sure it's the same way with you. So lovely to have you here, mags. I can't remember when you were here the last time. When was it? What's wrong, sweetheart? He had just asked me the exact same question. You think this needs more salt? Do you hear me? He just forgot, that's all. It happens to all of US. Before that, he was confused about what to buy! Darling, your father is 75 years old. He can't always be in tip-top shape! Now, will you please tell me if I should add more salt? Gardner? Do you have your reading glasses? Right here. Ah. And do I have the tickets? Yes, I do. And Amelia's recipe? Good. You ready to go, mags? Do I have a choice? Don't you want to hear your father read his latest poem? You did write the poem? Finished it last night. You think I should read it first? I want it to be a surprise for both of you. Careful, mother you're running over the grass! Your mother is a superb driver! Isn't this nice? Family outing. Just like the old days. You remember the cavanaughs? Sure. Remember Joseph Andrew, the middle son? Yes, he was in my class. He was arrested in Denver for embezzlement. What was he doing in Denver? Embezzling. Ha ha ha ha! He was such a good student. He was doing well until they caught him. Ha ha ha ha! Isn't that the de soto house? Oh, yes! How are they? Dead, the whole lot. He still looks good for an old codger. She never leaves his side, does she? Not since the day she became his teaching assistant. For which class? I think it was the seminar on Milton. Who ever heard of a love affair stemming from Milton? Professor church? Professor church, I wonder if you remember me. You're tivers from Vermont. Am I right? Yes, yes. If I remember correctly, you're also an oarsman. Well, yes. Are you racing today? I'll be rowing stroke. Good. We'll be looking for you. Thank you. I wish my class could be there but the boys of '39 are getting creaky. I'm teaching at Sarah Lawrence. Splendid. I'm able to incorporate what I learned in your class in contemporary American poetry. We're devoting three weeks to your work. I'm glad to hear that. I'm running a race with obsolescence. Not at Sarah Lawrence. I expect the best from you, tivers. You're gonna get it. Ready, all! Go! [Crowd shouts] Oh, what daddy would give to be rowing in this race. Oh, dear. Daddy's wearing a green tie. I was so busy this morning, I didn't have a chance to choose one. Well, it's green and mauve. It's green, Jade green. It has a mauve pattern. I looked at it on the way here. He looks absolutely regal. [Whistle blows] Many activities comprise our alumni day to represent the diversity of our lives at this fine school. One of the most distinguished members of our faculty, although now emeritus, has agreed to read his latest poem. Gardner church has been an important part of this university since 1935, first as a student, magna cum laude, and then as an inspirational teacher and a poet laureate. It is an honor to introduce to you professor gardner church. [Crowd mutters] This was inspired by Voltaire. If you would have my heart love on, "Grant me such years as suit the lover, "and teach me my twilight to recover "if but it could, the flush of dawn. "Time takes my elbow now in sign, "that I must bow "and turn away from gardens "where the god of wine divides with love "his pleasant sway. "Let US from rigorous time "obtain what timely blessings may assuage, "whoever will not be his age "knows nothing of his age but pain. "Leave then, to sweet and giddy youth "those ecstasies which youth can give, "two moments only do we live, "let there be one for sober truth. "What? "Will you leave me thus, forlorn? "O... "Tenderness, illusion, folly, "heavenly gifts whereby "I've borne life's bitterness and melancholy? "Two deaths we suffer. "To forgo loving and being loved in turn "is deathly pain as now I learn. "Ceasing to live is no such woe. "Thus do I mourn the loss of all those years "when I was young and mad, "my slow heart sighing to recall "the furious beat which once it had. "Friendship descending from above "came then in mercy to my aid. "She was as king, "perhaps, as love, "but not so ardent and more staid. "Touched by her charms, "so fresh they were, "and by her radiance calm and clear, "I followed her, "yet shed a tear "that I could follow none but her." Oh, oh! There she goes! Mags, how are you? I'm fine. Now, you and bartel know each other. I know you do. Hi. How are you? Fine. You? Good. Fine. Fine-- oh, hi. Um--can you excuse me for a second? Yes, yes. That was the most beautiful poem I've ever heard. Darling. Divine! Oh, daddy was brilliant, just brilliant! You've said that too many times already. What will you do if I say it twice more? Find you tedious. Impossible. That's true. You know that last part where you said you thought friendship would take the place of love and passion? Poesy, my darling. Mere poesy. I will die with passion in my heart for you. You've made daddy's nose much too big. Let me have a look at that! I think my nose is of that proportion. It most certainly is not! Look at me. I look positively jaundiced. It's the first layer. Didn't bartel look handsome? Mags? He looks the same. You know, he's divorced? Mother! I really think you should spend some time with him while you're here. I spent time with him years ago. He is not for me. Well, people change. Situations change. Not around here. Yes, they do. Not hopi stonewall. Hopi stonewall? Why would you bring up her name? I saw her today. Well, how is she? The same. The exact same. Nice girl. She went to vassar. Well, she talks with her jaw clenched. "Mags, darling. How are yoooo?" Ha ha ha. She married an economist from mit. Yes, but she's a gir-aaafe with lockjaw. Ha ha ha ha. Oh, mags, I love it when you're like this. Don't you? I could listen to her forever. When she wants to make a point, she moves her head with every word. "Mags! Still single?" "What a tragedy!" "My god, no! It's awful!" "Awww-ful!" Don't stop! Oh, mags. Don't stop! Don't stop! Mags, whatever happened to that musician you were seeing? Weren't you seeing a musician? A composer. What does he compose? Music. I'm just inquiring. We don't see each other anymore. I think you should give bartel a try. I have too much to do. You'll be able to squeeze in going to the chamber orchestra recital with him? No way! You must. Elizabeth and I have arranged it! Forget it, mother! But you can't disappoint bartel and Elizabeth or daddy and me! It's for your own good! It would be nice. I don't want to... Your whole life can't revolve around canvasses. Forget it. I only want what's best for you! You're not getting any younger, mags. Before you know it, all the nice young men will be taken! You'll be all by yourself in that grim little apartment with those toxic paint smells and that bright red hair! The flutist is a little off. Shh. In my opinion, no one does literal repetition as well as Mozart and mahler. The piano quartet was lacking in pure... Schumannesque qualities, infected with outside influences... Beethoven in the allegro movement, in the scherzo, mendelssohn, and bach in the finale. I forgot. What line of work did you go into? I'm an investment banker. Oh, yes. Right. And you. Did my mother say you'd become an artist? Yes. Uh-huh. And what kind of painting do you do? Have you sold anything? Have you had many shows? My painting is kind of hockneyesque in its interpretation, tintoretto in its scope and in its color, very Van eyckish. Mm-hmm. Ha ha ha ha! Well, um... Tonight was just... Ha. Well, uh... Good night. What are you doing? Are you going out? How was it? You're both waiting up to see how my date was? We had such fun! We never did this when you were a teenager. Mags never wanted dates as a teenager. How was it? It was predictable. Whose prediction, mine or yours? Well, there's no need to unpack the China. No wedding is imminent. We've devised a plan to cheer you just in case your date was not all you had hoped for. Well, cheer away. One... Two... Three... Ta da! We've decided to do another sitting for you. Really? We'll behave better this time, we promise. Great. This is going to be such fun! Doesn't daddy look absolutely lofty! I think I look exactly like that woman in the sargent painting. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha. Daddy! Please. Gardner church, what are you wearing on your feet? You packed away my dress shoes. These galoshes are all I can find. You know what it reminds me of? Don't go into that now. Ha ha ha. Daddy and I used to go sledding. Uh-huh. There were real snowstorms in those days, not like today's pathetic droppings. Don't get started on that. Daddy would stop riding early, put on those galoshes, and come looking for me, jingling the fasteners almost like castanets. It was a kind of mating call. Jingle them. No. Come on. [Jingle] Daddy, hold still! After a storm, the hill was deserted. We had it all to ourselves. It was so romantic. We'd haul that sled up to the top of Houston street and aim it straight down. Daddy would lie down on the sled. I'd lower myself on top, and we'd rock back and forth to gain momentum, and then whoosh! Mother, will you sit down! Like a pair of eagles locked in a spasm of lovemaking! Oh, remember that, gar? Indeed, I do. Sometimes daddy would lower himself on top of me. I liked that even better. Come on, you guys! Ha ha ha ha! You two are impossible! I was crazy to think I could pull this off! Come on, magsy, don't get your knickers in a twist! Now I know why it's taken me all these years to get you to pose. You can't take me seriously. Poor old mags and her ridiculous portraits. Darling, your portraits aren't ridiculous. They may not be all that everyone hopes for, but... You don't take me seriously! You never have! You never will! I'm not what you hoped for! Isn't that it? I have abilities! I don't care what you think! I don't care what you say! I have abilities! What's going on here? I thought you like to sleep late? Where are you off to? I think it's best if I go back to New York. I took the things from my room that I wanted to keep. I am not comfortable here! Why don't you give US another chance? It would be better if I go home. I am in the way here. Oh, come off it, mags! No, really, daddy. You're happiest when you're alone with mother! And I have had that feeling my whole life. Well, probably that's true. I'm sorry about that, mags, but that's who we are. We're far from perfect parents. Far from it. That's the way things are going to remain, because that's who we are. I'm sorry that we don't live up to your expectations. We can't. But for your own well-being, accept US... With our flaws. And stop longing for US to change. My dear, we won't. We can't. Well, i'm, uh-- going to take a walk. I'll visit... Charlie and Amelia wickstrom. I'll be gone for a while. Please stay. Gardner. Where's daddy? He went out for a walk. Maybe to visit the wickstroms. Walk? To the wickstroms? But that's five miles away! He hasn't done that in years. That's what he said. I almost tripped on your suitcase on my way down the stairs. I'm going to wait until he gets home before I leave. Mags, why must everything with you be so dramatic? Why can't you be more like daddy and me? We both have such humor. My, my, my! You're doing well! Here! And here's for you! She's doing the garden again! Doesn't that feel good? How are they going to be out on time? Hi, Mrs. Church! We tried calling. No answer. Oh. Well, my husband's gone for a walk and I'm out in the garden, so I probably didn't hear. We'd like to bring in our contractor. It's going to be quite warm today. If the contractor could walk through the house, it'll give US a leg up on repairs. We could barrel through this... Please, please, no more cliches. This is a literary home. You can tear down walls. Gut the rooms, but promise me you will never use cliches in this house! The door's open. Go right in. Do whatever it is you have to do. If you want my assistance, sound the clarions! Gardner should have been home by now. I'm getting awfully worried about him. Would you excuse me for a moment? The contractor should have been here by 1o:Oo. These people are wacko. How are they ever going to get rid of all this junk in a week? Amelia? Hello, darling. It's Fanny. Has gardner left yet? Hasn't he been to visit you? He told mags he was walking to your house. No, I don't think he's having an affair. I'll call you later, darling. Yes. Yes, right. I will. They haven't seen him this morning. Well, where could he have gone? [Doorbell rings] I got it! Please! This is still our house. Who the hell are you? This is our contractor, Jim. Jim, this is the prev-- present house owner, Mrs. Church. Nice meeting you. Gardner! Where are you? We can't find my father. Maybe we should show you the upstairs. Where are they going? To figure out ways to destroy this house. Mags, really. Does daddy go on long walks often? Not lately. [Telephone rings] Hello? Who? Oh...just a minute. Yoo hoo! Mrs. Buttons! Telephone for you... Already. Oh! We're going to look for my husband. Would you pick up the phone? Sure. Mags, let's see what that father of yours is up to, and to bring him home. Mom, you missed that car by a fraction of an inch. I've been driving for 35 years, and I've never had an accident yet! Mrs. Church, how are you today? Have you seen my husband today? No, ma'am. He was here a few days ago. I just want you to know that if anything's happened to daddy, I'm going to kill myself. Fanny, how lovely to see you. Mags, what a surprise. Bradley, have you seen gardner this morning? No, I haven't. Is anything wrong? Well, he's been gone for five hours. He's never gone away that long. Lately his mind... Nothing's wrong with his mind. We should call the police. Maybe that would be best. There's a phone right here. Would you like me to-- of course! Gardner! Gardner, can you hear me? Mags, come on down and help me. Daddy! Mother! Stop! Oh, my god. God. Is that his hat? Gardner! God! Gardner! Do you see him? No! Somebody help! Please! Daddy! Gardner! Mags, go around there and see if you can see anything. I'll meet you on the other side. Mother! Go get help! There's his... There's his boat! Get to him. Get to him! Daddy! Hurry, mags! Hurry! Gardner! Gardner! Daddy! Mrs. Church. Oh! How is he? We don't know yet. He's still unconscious. What was it? How long before we know something? That's hard to tell. Go home and I'll call when there's something. We'll stay. It could be hours, maybe overnight. There is nothing you can do here. Doctor, could we see him before we leave? Please? What? Gar... You know how I hate when you don't listen to me. You're going to come out of this. Aren't you? Aren't you, gardner? Mother, let's go. No. I'll stay here. I think we should wait at home. [Knock on door] Yeah? Can I come in? Of course. When I met and married your father, something happened to me, something physical. An emptiness I'd always felt as a child... Was filled. I thought you were a happy child. I was. But I became an even happier adult. Now... When I look across the room at daddy, I still to this day marvel at the fact that he married me. I suppose women of your generation would say I wrapped my identity around daddy. Well, perhaps I do. And because things are so good between daddy and me... Oh... Not good. Wonderful. Oh, it makes the time go even faster. Whoosh. Like on a sled. I always have the feeling that... We have less time together than our friends. So many of them just tolerate each other. They have more unwanted time. Ours is so precious because it's so wanted. Am I making sense to you, mags? Yeah. I think so. Now, each time he has one of those memory lapses, do you think I'm blind? I want to be blind to it. It's the primary reason I've decided to move to cotuit. I don't want anyone to see him diminished in any way. Let it happen in seclusion. I just want US to exit with a little flourish. I'm so afraid to lose him because there's still so much. I wish I'd been more important to him. It's not true, mags. It was daddy who insisted on having a baby. I didn't want anything to interrupt our eternal honeymoon. Is that what I did? Oh, a baby changes one's life. But you were such a sweet little thing. Oh, mags. You would have been much happier if daddy and I didn't like each other so very much. By now you probably know I sure as hell didn't go visit the wickstroms. I'm just relieved you weren't having an affair. Well, I was having an affair, with that damned lake. You overdid it, gar. You were dehydrated. You will never learn. You could have brought a bottle of bourbon with you. Mags, come here. Daddy, I'm glad you're alright. Oh, mags, I'm so sorry. I didn't do this just to make you stay. You have to stay overnight for observation. What could they possibly observe they haven't already observed? Tomorrow we get to take you home. By car, not by boat. That's very humorous. She's a fine-looking woman, isn't she? Then tomorrow night, I'm going to make tangerine duck. I have to have one foot in the grave to get tangerine duck! I haven't had it since graduation. We're all going to have it tomorrow. "Fortune brings in some boats that are not steered." One of Shakespeare's more remote and obscure inaccessible plays. Cymbaline. We'd better go. Come back here. Boys, boys... Now listen very carefully, there's a room here and a room here and they're filled with furniture so you must be very careful when you bring them down. And around the corner... Yoo hoo! The moving has commenced. The moving has commenced. Come with me, now. This is my husband's study. Everything in it is very precious. Nothing must be packed unless I'm here to supervise it, got that? Everything in here has to go-- pictures, fireplace, everything. No breakage. Put that down, if you please. Follow me, please? Thank you. Please be careful with this. My great-grandfather bought this from the Roosevelt family. Please, you are not to scratch it. Fanny, look at this. Not now, gardner. Read the dedication. Can't it wait? Read it now. "To gardner church, "we walked a ways together. Robert frost." Ah! What a treasured possession. We had some good years here, didn't we? Fresh lemonade, and I do mean fresh. My husband brought these lemons home yesterday. Hey, I found the car insurance policy. Wonderful. Where was it? Tucked in a volume of Richard wilbur's poems. I'm all finished. Did you label the ones going to New York? Yes, ma'am. Why don't you two enjoy the day while I stay with these men of brawn. There you are. Oh. That's hammered gold on linen. Exquisite. She's a beauty. Daddy, it's a he. 2,4oo b.C. Here's something fascinating. Along about this time, these texts began to appear on the inner walls of the pyramids. Different spells and incantations and prayers, all to protect the afterlife of his nibs, the pharaoh. What did I just order? Ham and Swiss. That's right. I like that. I'm thinking about your mother. All those cartons going out of the house. The masses of stuff we've accumulated over the years. How do you feel about moving away? If it's what your mother wants, it's what I want. When you were in the hospital... I thought I might never have a chance-- there were things I wanted to talk to you about, ask you about. What kind of things? What do you think of my work? I'm not sure I can answer that. It's important for me to know. I... I haven't seen your recent work, but I think you are on the verge of finding yourself, in yourself, as an artist. I sense that you still need that crazy courage. The courage we all need to invade our own privacy, hold back nothing in our work. You have it. I know you have it. Find more of that, mags, and you'll be very good. You'll paint like no one else. I never knew you'd given that much thought to my painting. I can still see the big picture. It's the little details that confound me lately. That's it. Yes. Yes, yes. However will you get all of this from the train to your apartment? I'm used to lugging things around. Would you stay with US a little longer? Spend the weekend with US at cotuit. I can't. I have to return to New York and take my painting to the gallery owner. What's the name of that gallery? The one we never heard of in Tribeca. [Car starts] You'll visit US again soon? Of course she will. Well, I better go. Good luck with your show. All your endeavors. Any chance you'll come to the show? When would it be? Second week of September. We'll still be settling into the new place. We would have loved to. You understand, don't you, darling? Yeah. Sure. Last call for boarding to grand central station. I gotta go. Bye. Bye, darling. Gardner! In a minute. [Chuckling] Gardner? Yoo hoo! Gardner! Yes, right here. Oh, dear. What if I stashed something away 3o years ago? Something I wanted hidden for my old age? Now I've forgotten it. The new owners, the buttons, will gut it out, melt it down, or lacquer it away, or... I think we should go. Anthony, could we hang that one there? Sure. Carl, could you give US a hand? You bet. Get the corner. Do you think anyone's gonna show up? Of course. I'm terrified. Why? Is this right? Up a little on the right. Here? Yes, ok. Great. Yeah? An inch more... Yes. Hello. Hi. Thank you for coming. So many people! Yeah, it's great. This is Bob and Julie. How are you? A wonderful show. Excuse me. I'd like you to meet someone. You're doing fine. Here she is! Margaret, I'd like you to meet Mr. and Mrs. bagadalerian. They've been enjoying your work. Thanks. I know a lot about your collection. Make them buy a painting, huh? It's an honor that you came. Excuse me. I've been looking for you. I've been looking for you. What a shame. They should see your paintings. The trip would be a lot for them. They're moving into their new cottage in Cape Cod. Well, you have them here. Excuse me for disturbing you, Ms. Church. Isn't your father gardner church? Yes. He is. Will he be here? No. Always admired his work. [Fanny] Yoo hoo! Gardner! Where are you? Can you hear me? [Gardner] Stop shouting, Fanny. I can hear you. [Fanny] This cannot be right. We're lost, gardner. This is the wrong place. [Gardner] All this beautiful work. [Fanny] Mags can't have done all this. [Gardner] These were your secrets. What? Are you here? [Gardner] Tell US more, mags. Where are you? Daddy? Do I hear you? [Fanny] Mags, forgive me. I never thought that-- Oh, mags! Magsy. Magsy! It's all quite remarkable. You have so much to give! You two. Oh, my little girl. You've actually made me look, well, not bad. Except you forgot daddy's goulashes.
