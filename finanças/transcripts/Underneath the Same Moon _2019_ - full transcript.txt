(eerie music) (film projector rattling) (dramatic music) (rock music) (waves crashing) - That was a sweet ride, son. You a pro? - Naw man, just a seasoned amateur. - Well after that ride, it's all downhill from here. - Believe me man, it's nothing compared to what I've got planned later on today. (soft jazz music) (tense music) Hey. What's up man? How you doin'? - I'm good, how about you? (Tom sighs) Why the long face? - I don't know man, I was hoping that ad agency was gonna make me an offer. Instead, today was my last day. Get a beer, please? - Well I mean, you'll land on your feet. You always do. - I know man, I just, I want to be settled, you know? - Yeah, well you're settled where it counts. Kelly's the best thing that has ever happened to you. - Amen to that, brother. - [Scott] Check this out. (Scott chuckles) - Oh what? - Okay, what do you think? - I hate to break it you but, I'm already spoken for, so I'm sorry. - It's for Cheryl, dumb-ass. I'm gonna ask her to marry me tonight. - That's awesome, Scott. - Thank you. - What took so long? - I have you to thank for it. - Meaning what? - I never really thought that you were gonna get over what happened with you and Jessica. And you and Kelly are showing me that there's something to this whole marriage thing. - We've only been married for six months, now let's not get ahead of ourselves. - Yeah, but you're a changed person. We've been friends for a long time, and I don't think I've ever seen you this happy before. I mean, you've transformed. - You know, I couldn't imagine my life without Kelly. That's for sure. - Hey, you don't have to. That's what marriage is all about. - Hey, you guys. I don't think anybody's ever proposed in this bar before. But I just want to say that you did, and I am just so honored to have been here when you did that. - Get goin', Randy. - Well that's just the way it is. - Git. - Listen to me, young man. I heard you say that you're not working anymore, but all you need is the love of a good man, and that is what you have. - [Scott] Randy. - I'm tellin' you what, Randy. Enough's enough. Now get back to your throne. Get over there to your throne. - [Scott] Same thing every week. - All right, all right. Well, I would kiss the bride if I knew... - Get going! - Sure. - We'll see you later. - [Randy] All right. - All right, we'll send you a beer. Get that guy a beer, jeez. (light music) - Hey baby. - Hey, how are you? - No, we're just gonna go into the living room. Take a seat. So? - No go. Yeah, they can't fill that spot for at least another three months. I don't know, who would have known getting a staff copywriter position would have been so difficult. - So, there's hope. - I guess. I gotta go back Monday to the temp agency, and I have get something. You know, we can't go three months without a paycheck. - You and your sister are not having an easy time of it. Must be the whole twin connection thing. - When is Holly's next interview? - Wednesday. I'm going shopping with her tomorrow to help pick out a suit for the interview. - Well, something smells good. What's for dinner? - Uh-uh-uh, it's a surprise. You wait here, and I'll call you when it's ready. - Okay, I'm gonna sample these little guys. - [Kelly] Put those away! - You're serious? - [Kelly] Oh yeah. - Okay. Sorry. (gentle music) The wedding song. Mm-hmm, it's gonna be a good dinner. Oh man. Okay. It's not my birthday. It's not your birthday. It's not our anniversary. What's goin' on? - If you didn't get the offer, I needed a reason to celebrate. We were married exactly six months ago, today. Happy anniversary. - Now I don't think they make cards for these sort of occasions, so. - Then here you go. - What is this? - I want all your wishes to come true. - Gosh, they have. And I feel like a real jerk because I can't even share my chocolates with you because there's peanuts in 'em. - And I kissed you. Get those out of here. - I know, I'm sorry. Let's eat. - Yeah. Cheers. - Cheers. (waves crashing) - Honey, thanks for tonight. I mean it. - Ah, it was nothing. - No, it was something. Hey, guess what? - Hmm? - Scott's gonna ask Cheryl to marry him. - Finally! When is he gonna pop the question? - Friday night. He also asked me to be the best man. He said, if I can be this happy, then there must be something about this marriage thing. - That's so sweet. Are you? - Am I what? - Happy? - I am very happy. Why do you ask? - I know the whole Jessica thing still freaks me out. - That was a very long time ago. And you never even met her. - But you loved her. You were going to ask her to marry you. - You never loved someone before? - So you were in love? - Answer my question. - I thought I was. But when I met you, I realized none of it was really love. - Look, we're different people, at different points in our lives. The person I am now is the person I like the most. Does that answer your question? - Yes. You know were my final guy? - Well, that's good. You married me, so. - No, I mean I had given up on the whole dating thing. Too many heartaches. Too many jerks. You know I didn't date for a year before your sister set us up? I was so not interested. But you know your sister. She wouldn't take no. - Oh yeah. - When I went on our first date, in my mind, it was my final date. I've got an idea. Let's watch the video. - Not the wedding video. Again. - [Kelly] Yes, the wedding video. (Tom groans) Just the vow part, I promise. - [Tom] Exciting. - [Kelly] I promise I won't tear up this time. - Here we go. - [Minister] Tom has a few words he would like to say. Tom? (clearing throat) - So, I know this is a bit of a surprise, but I wrote a few things down. Okay, I know I'm not always great with words, so I really wanted to make sure I got this right. I wanted to tell you what is obvious, to anyone that knows you. You are the most caring, loving person I have ever met. (clearing throat) (Tom exhales) For a very long time, I gave up on love, and then even gave up on the idea that love exists. (clearing throat) You... (garbled talking) Ah, I still can't believe we paid that videographer. His battery dies right when I'm starting to get good. - Finish it. - Finish what? - Please? - I don't remember. - You remember, please? (Tom sighs) (clearing throat) - Okay. Sure? Okay, here we go. You taught me to dream again, or you made me believe I could dream again. You showed me the only thing more joyful than a young heart is a broken heart learning to love again. Ah, you said you weren't gonna tear up. - You said you didn't remember. - I love you. - I love you. - [Kelly] I feel like Miller's such a basic last name. - I know but I feel like you need it to be something cool, like if you named the baby to be something like, like Roger. - No. - Why? I think that would be cool. - That's just as basic as Miller. - I don't know if that's true. I think that's kind of a cool name. Roger. - [Kelly] I don't know. - I'm really into this guy named Roger. - What if it's like, Henry? - Welcome in. (electronic dance music) Ooh. Welcome in. BizNaz. All the clothes you need, anything you want, okay. Anything you want. I'm gonna take this in the back. You holler out if you need me. - Thank you. - Thanks. - Hey Holls, what about this? - No, I think I need to go skirt, this place is V corporate. - I thought you said they make boxes? - For corporations. Kell. Did I mention how much I hate this whole interview thing? - You mean other than five minutes ago, and five minutes before that? Other than that, no. - When are you gonna cut all of this off? - Are you kidding? Tom has a stroke when I get the split ends trimmed. (Holly laughing) - So how was the whole anniversary thing? - It was sweet. - What? - Well you know I'll always wonder if Tom would have committed to me if I didn't get pregnant. - Trust me, my brother, my brother loves you. - What makes you so sure? - You know. The eyebrow thing. - What? - Whenever my brother really loves someone, he does this goofy grin, and he like, twists he right eyebrow like. Mm-hmm. He did it with Cathy Meester in the third grade, and he did it with Courtney Phillips in the 10th. He does it with you. - What about with Jessica? - Jessica threat rears its head. No, that was just my brother showing a tremendous lack of judgment. That was not love. - Okay. - Okay. (Holly chuckles) Hey Kelly. - Hmm? - This say boxes, or what? - [Kelly] Totally. (Kelly laughs) - I think I just need to go back to being a waitress. You know, the last time I saw Jessica, she came into Applebottoms with that dude she dumped Tom for. You wouldn't believe what we did to their Caesar salad. Oh, actually I was going in there. - You'll just have to wait. - I'm sorry, I didn't know there was a buffet line in the dressing room.

He sustained massive head trauma in the accident. It's quite amazing that he's alive, actually. He also broke his left leg, and several ribs. He's in a deep coma right now. The next 48 hours will be crucial. - Oh my God. - We're doing everything we can, if that's any consolation. - Can I see him? - Do you feel up to it? - Yes. (heart monitor beeping) (somber music) "The only thing more joyful than a young heart "is a broken one that learns to love again." (Kelly crying) (muffled talking on intercom) (gentle acoustic music) (somber music) (phone ringing) - Hi, Dr. Williams. Yeah. What? What! - Good morning, come on in. Please sit down. I had to tell you, you both must have been praying pretty loudly, because somebody heard you. Who says there's no such thing as a miracle? (women laughing) - Can I see my husband now? - Well, right now I want to introduce you to Dr. Butler. - Hi. - [Doctor] He's the hospital staff psychiatrist. - Psychiatrist? - Yes. First, let me say how happy I am that Thomas has come back to you two. - What's wrong with my husband, Doctor? - Mrs. Miller, your husband was in a deep coma for almost a year. The fact that he sustained no brain damage or motor skills problems, is quite extraordinary. - But? - But there is an issue. I spoke with him for quite a while this morning. Basically, he has lost all of his memories of approximately the last five years of his life. - Five years, holy shit! Sorry. - It's okay, I understand your reaction. - Is this permanent? - It's been my experience, and Dr. Williams can confirm, that cases like this are extremely rare. Most patients slowly begin to remember things over time. - Time? You're telling me my husband won't even recognize me? - Not right now. But he may at some point, especially as he is reintroduced to the newer aspects of his life over a gradual basis. - Gradual? - What I am proposing is somewhat unorthodox. And of course, you ultimately can decide on what you want to do from here on out. - What is it exactly that you're proposing? - I am proposing that you set up his life, at least initially, to as close as it was of what it used to be five years ago. You know, he just suffered a huge trauma, and finding out he has a wife he doesn't know, and he has a life he doesn't understand could right now cause more damage than good. - I don't know what to say. - Right now, say nothing. Give it some thought. Are you ready to see him? (muffled talking on intercom) Hey Tom, how ya feeling? - Hey, Doc. - Hey, Sis. - Hey, sleepyhead. - Get over here. - [Holly] My God. - They tell me it's been a while. - It was much too long. - Hi, do I know you? - [Doctor] Oh, this is... - My name's Kelly. I'm a good friend of your sister's. We've both been really worried about you. - It's nice to meet you. - [Doctor] How you feelin', Tom? - I feel like I've been in a coma for 11 months. (laughing) - That'll pass. - Does Jessica know I'm here? - We will talk about that later, you just need to get some rest, okay? - Can I call her? - We'll talk about it later. - [Doctor] Yes Tom, you need to get some rest. We've got months of rehabilitation before you can go home. - Okay. I love you, Sis. - [Holly] I love you. Don't die. - I'm alive. Call me later. - Bye Tom. I'm really glad you're feeling better. - Thanks, Betty. - It's Kelly. - I'm sorry. (car alarm beeping) (somber music) - He really has no idea who I am. He looked right through me. - You heard what the doctor said, it just takes time. He's alive. He's gonna be okay, everything else will just, it'll fall into place. - What if it doesn't? What if he just never remembers? - You just gotta to stay positive. - And he's in love with Jessica. - I'm gonna have a little talk with him, once he's up to it, and you know, I'm gonna tell him what a bitch that she is, and you start coming around, and you wear those little outfits, and everything'll go back to normal. It's gonna be okay, Kell. - Haven't you heard? It's Betty. What are we gonna do? I can't believe this is happening. It's like I've been erased from his mind, like, like I never even existed. I don't even know what to think about this Doctor Butler guy, but I guess I have to listen to what he's saying. I don't want to hurt Tom. - Okay, I know that this sucks, and I can't imagine how hard this must be for you, but we have to stay positive. We have to believe that he's gonna go back to normal. So, I guess he's gonna have to come live with me at first, like he did back then. The doctor said that we have to recreate the situation as much as possible. Kell, you're gonna have to help me go back in time.

(Tom exhaling) - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Okay. You kinda smell. (Holly laughing) - Okay so. Fill me in. - Okay. Okay but, this is gonna be hard to hear, because five years is a really long time to lose. The day that you were gonna propose, you found out that Jessica had been seeing another guy, and then she moved to San Francisco with him a few months later. She broke your heart, Tom. You even gave up surfing. - Gave up surfing? Why? - I don't know, you said like, the morning you were gonna propose you got this perfect wave, and then after the break, you were like, "perfection's an illusion, "and surfing's a waste of time," or some stupid shit like that. I don't know, you say a lot of weird stuff. I think every time you saw a surfboard, it just brought you back to that time. - Wow. And I've never seen or heard from her again? - Nope. - What have I been doing the last five years? I didn't meet anyone else, or? - There's a chick. It's just, it's a little complicated. - Hey, I wouldn't know her if I tripped over her. (Holly chuckles) - The way you're walking you just might. (Tom sighs) Hey. Sorry bro. - Yeah, I know. So what'd you do, change the locks, or what? (Tom laughs) - Okay. - I'm the best sister alive. - Yes, yes you are. - [Holly] Uh-huh. - I still think it's crazy that we lived together all this time. - Yeah, yeah, don't get used to it. As soon as you're on your own two feet, you're outta here. - Me? - I got used to living here alone, you were gone for almost a year, it was awesome. I'm kidding. I'm happy you're alive. (somber music) - When was this? (knocking on door) I'll get it. - [Kelly] Hi, Tom. Welcome home. - Hi Betty. - [Kelly] It's Kelly. - I'm sorry, Kelly. I have a tough time remembering that. - Hi! - [Holly] Hey, come on in. - So I'm gonna go lay down for a bit. I'm tired, and I haven't got to sleep in my own bed forever, so. - You don't wanna come out to lunch? - Naw, not this time. You guys have a good time. (people chattering) - I'm starting to fell really uncomfortable about all this. Maybe we should, maybe we should just tell him. - You know, I've had a complete revelation about this whole situation. I've always wondered if Tom would have committed to me if I hadn't gotten pregnant, and now's my chance to find out. - How, exactly? - It's a clean slate. I just get him to fall in love with me and propose. (Holly laughs) - You're joking. Oh my god. - Just give it a few months, please? For me? - Two, I'll give you two months, and then I'm spilling the beans. You know, it took him four months to commit to getting that Dodge Durango. - I'm prettier. - It gets better mileage. ♪ Hit it ♪ ♪ That's what I'm talkin' about ♪ ♪ Wait ♪ ♪ Okay now, from the beginning ♪ - [Sportscaster] Strike three call. - Hey, sis. - [Sportscaster] Completes another three up, three down inning. - So, how long have you and Betty been friends? - It's Kelly. Like, four years? We met each other at work, and we just really hit it off. Why? Do you, do you like her? - She's nice, but not my type. Speaking of my type, guess who I spoke with today? - Do not say Jessica. - Yeah. - Oh my god, I'm gonna kill myself. - I found her number online, and we spoke for like, three hours. She's been divorced for seven months, and said she would love if I came up and visited her. - Why, what does this mean? - Who knows? I'm gonna go up there and see her next week, and we'll see. - Do you really think that this is a good idea? - Yeah, I feel like I need to do this. What are you doing? - She broke your heart, Tom! Seriously, you did not leave the house for three years. You gave up surfing, for God's sake. - I get what you're saying, okay? But I didn't feel those feelings. It was like it happened to someone else. - It didn't, I was there. - People change. - They don't. They don't. They just get from bad to worse. - I have to do this. Just trust me. (muffled rock music) (people chattering) - So how's my husband? (glasses clink) (both groaning) (Kelly coughs) - I think it's time that you have that little talk. He's thinking of driving up to San Francisco to see Jessica. - You're joking. - Nope. - Oh my god, this is not good. - How many is that? - I stopped counting at five. (Holly laughing) - Yeah. Where are you going? Seriously, I just got here. - Gotta pee, order me another one. - Okay. - So, who's your friend? - Actually, that's my sister-in-law. Yeah, she's married to my brother, who was just in a coma, but now has amnesia, he's gonna drive up to San Francisco tomorrow to see an old fling. So, yeah, you still interested? - Hey, she sounds really hot to me. Will you give me her number? Tell her... (man laughing) - What about you? Do you have a husband with amnesia? - No, but I would like to develop a case that would make me lose these last five minutes. Seriously, team, guys, it's not a good time, okay? Just go do whatever you were doing before you saw us. - Do you think this is easy? I mean, you just get to sit there and order drinks. We have to walk over, make small talk, and risk being shot down. Did you ever think of that? - Here's a hint, you know what? It helps if you have charm and charisma, and a better line than, "how's your friend?" Also, fresh breath would be helpful for you. It would help. - Bitch. - Better, you know what? You should keep working on it, Cacanova. You stay in the game, buddy. No, I think you're doing a really good job. Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah. (laughing) - What is that all about? - He's just some dude with kickin' breath. It smelled like if he had cream of onion and garlic soup, but strained it through a rotting corpse first. - Oh, I've got an awesome idea. We have a satellite office in San Francisco. They've been wanting me to go up there for a long time and do some training. Maybe Tom would like some company on that road trip? - Come on Kelly, no. - Think about it. Two whole days together, alone. - Okay, I'll run it by him. But seriously Kell, this is it. - Ah, you're the best. - Yeah, let's just hope that that judge thinks so when I try and get out of that ticket, tomorrow. Yeah? - Yeah. - Seriously, you could use a breath mint yourself, dude. (Kelly exhaling) Stop, oh god. (Kelly laughing) Why is everyone gross? - Hey, group hug, huh? - No, that's okay. You know what? - No! - Time to go, time to go. - Please stop! - Check, please. - Get away. - [Man] The Honorable Judge Smails will now hear the case of Holly Miller. (ominous orchestral music) (judge exhales) (judge sniffs) (gavel bangs) - [Judge] Bitch. - Don't worry, I have our wedding song on CD, and his favorite little black dress. - If all else fails, just tell him you're bisexual, and super into threesomes with girls named Jessica, okay?

I'm glad she has such a good friend. - Yeah, I feel the same way. It's almost like we're sisters, you know, related in some way. So, tell me what Jessica's like. - She's beautiful. You know, she's the type of girl that when she walks in a room, everyone stops and stares. - But what is she like? - What do you mean? - Like, is she funny, caring, smart? - I guess, why? - Well, she just must be something special, if you're driving all the way up north to see her. - She is. What about you? Someone special? - I was married once. But it's kind of a distance between us. - Oh, sorry. - Yeah. Still holding out hope, though. He may come around.

(solemn piano music) - Hey, come here. I love wishing wells. This one actually looks exactly like the one that my husband and I saw in Ireland on our honeymoon. I'd given him a penny to drop in, and just before he dropped it in, he stops, and he goes, "I don't need to make a wish, "because all of my wishes already came true." - Wow. He sounds like a really good guy. - Yeah. Here. Make a wish. (penny plopping) What'd you wish for? - Now, if I tell you, it won't come true. Isn't this how this whole thing works? - Well, be sure to tell me when it does. - Wow, I just had like major deja vu. - Yeah, me too. - Hmm. Let's get going. - Looks like a storm's coming. (light music) (waves crashing) Your sister tells me you were quite the surfer in your day. - Yeah, it used to mean the world to me. You know when you catch the right wave at the right angle, it's like capturing the perfect moment in time. - If something meant that much to me, I wouldn't give it up for anything, or anyone. - Can I ask you a question? Do people change? - I think it's possible, but you need true motivation. - Like what? - Oh, I don't know. (sighs) Maybe love? - Look at that guy. See him glide down the side of that? - Yeah. - [Tom] You just can't beat it. - It's beautiful. You know what would happen to me if I tried that? (blows raspberry) - Okay, so that coffee gave me a second wind. - Listen, do you mind if I pop in a CD? I'm old school. - No, go ahead. - I know this is dorky, but this song really means a lot to me. It's about two lovers who are separated, but they find comfort knowing that they're sleeping underneath the same moon. - Oh I like that, it's like me and Jessica. - No! - No, what? - I mean, ow, Tom, my hair's stuck, this really hurts! - Let me see. Let me try to open the CD. - Shit! - You know what, it's jammed, I can't, I can't. - Tom this really hurts! - [Tom] Okay, I have a knife or a pair of scissors. - [Kelly] Tom, what?! - I got 'em! - What?! - Don't hate me for this! - No no no no no! (gasps) (Kelly squeaks) (Tom sighs) - It's not so bad. I mean... (sighs) (horn honking) Okay, so they're gonna reset the computer and give the CD player a haircut. We're gonna be outta here in about an hour. - Well, let's hope they do a better job than you did on mine. Oh, God. - [Tom] I'm sorry about that. Okay, look, I was, I didn't know what to do, I panicked, okay? You were hurting, and I didn't want the CD player to scalp you, so I didn't know. - But you hate short hair! I mean, I hate short hair.

Oh, a shower will feel so good right now. - Hey, it looked like there was a pretty nice restaurant downstairs, with a piano bar. You want to go to dinner there later? - Sure. I'll meet you there in an hour? - Sounds good.

(thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) (Tom groans) (Kelly laughs) (Tom laughs) - Tom. I'm so sorry. - For what? - For everything. I feel like me coming along on this trip was a terrible idea. - Stop. Actually, I've had a lot of fun with you. (gentle music) You're looking at a guy who's been in a coma for 11 months. I mean. (Kelly sighs) - What's going on? - Actually, I told him to play it.

Why are you awake? - I woke up, light was beaming through the curtains. Got up to adjust 'em. Saw you out here. Are you okay? - I don't know. I guess. - Anything I can do? I mean, I know you don't really know me, but if it helps to talk about it, I'm all ears. I couldn't fall asleep. I've got a lot on my mind. Got a lot of nervous energy. - I'm just sad. I really miss my husband, and I don't know if he's ever gonna come back. I never even got to say goodbye. I just, I wish things could have been different. I feel like I failed him. We were gonna have a baby, and I lost it. I was pregnant when we got married, and I always wondered if he would have married me if it weren't for the baby. (waves crashing) I just feel really alone. Whenever I was afraid, or upset, he would cover me up and wrap his arms around me, and tell me that everything's gonna be okay. (clearing throat) - Hey, everything is gonna be okay. Hey, you ready? - Yeah. It's so beautiful, don't you think? - Yeah, I do. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm ready, let's go. - [Kelly] You wanna drive? - [Tom] No, I'll let you drive. - [Kelly] Oh, kinky. (light music) - Well, I'm glad you got a haircut. Kinda starting to look like Owen Wilson. (laughing) - Yeah, wow! (Kelly laughing) Hey, you look kinda tired. Nap if you want. I'm an excellent driver. Yeah, I'm an excellent driver. That's supposed to be Rain Man. I love that movie. - Yeah, me too. You're full of surprises. I see why my sister likes you. Kind of a nutty, nutjob too. (laughing) - Yeah, I guess so. She's next level though. I could tell you some stories. - Oh, you don't have to. (laughing) (radio changing stations) (acoustic guitar music) - Oh yes! Yes, please, thank you. - What are you doing? - I dedicate this song to you. - Me? - I don't think you're ready.

(body thudding) (Kelly screaming) (tires squealing) Did I just hit someone? - It was like a body wrapped in a tent, or something. (Tom groans) (mysterious music) Oh. Oh no. - Is that a person? - What is that? - Is that normal? - That's not normal for a healthy, grown elephant. - Does rigor mortis set in that quickly? - I don't know. What do you think he was doing before we hit him? Stay there, I'm gonna touch him. - No, no. No! (Tom shouting) - What the hell? - [Kelly] My god. - Who would do that? - That is messed up. - [Tom] Oh my god, I thought we killed Gene Simmons. No! (car starting) (man laughing) - [Man] Suckers! (Tom groans) - Okay, so that happened. Yep. No signal. So we can't call the cops and we are miles from anywhere. - This is unbelievable! Nothing's going right. I wake up from a coma, and I have the possibilities of something good happening, and it's just one thing after another. It sucks! You know, I should have just flown up there. I thought driving would be a good idea, and it's been nothing but a nightmare. - I had my hair torn off. My things are in that car, all my clothes. I'm gonna miss my meeting. You know, maybe you weren't supposed to go up there. From what I hear, Jessica sounds like a pretty awful person who hurt you really badly. Why would you want to be with somebody like that? You deserve so much better. - Come on. What about you? - Me? - Yeah, sittin' around waiting for Mr. Wonderful. - You know what? I'm not so sure he's so wonderful after all. Besides, that's not the same thing. - You know what? You can do better than that jerk. He bailed on you, and that's stupid. You're pretty, you're smart, you're funny. You can have anyone you want. How much longer are you gonna wait for that jerk, anyways? - I don't know. I don't know. Asshole. (somber music) (Tom sighs) - Yeah. I can't believe this. Nobody's stopping. We're gonna die of dehydration out here. - You know, I told you to stop and pick up a hitchhiker yesterday, and you said he's probably a serial killer. Now it's what they're thinking about us. - We're not serial killers. - Yeah, he probably wasn't either. - Yeah. You're right. You know, you kind of look like a serial killer. (Tom laughs) What are you doing? Oh watch out, here we go. Here we go. Yes. - [Man] You guys okay, you need a ride? - Yes, thank you, sir. - What are you guys doing out here? You guys hikers? You don't look like hikers. Are you thirsty? - [Tom And Kelly] Yes. - Well, there's a couple of waters underneath the seat right there, if you want. - Yes. Oh, that's good. Thank you so much. - [Driver] You're welcome. - We're actually not hikers. We had our car stolen, and then they left us stranded. - That sounds just like the Benson brothers. Those guys, they run out of things to do, they get bored. They're all done tipping over cows, and teepeeing farmhouses. They don't know what else to do but go for a little joyride. - So they steal cars for fun? - More like they borrow 'em. They take 'em for a little while, and then they just drop 'em off somewhere. They know if they actually stole it, the sheriff would lock 'em up. Which one did they get you guys with? The scarecrow, or the SOS dummy. - I don't know, I think the scarecrow. I guess. - You're so lucky. The SOS dummy, shit would have been splattered everywhere. - Yeah, that is lucky. That's disgusting. - Look! There's our car. - [Tom] And it is! - [Driver] Yep, there it is, that's their work. (Kelly sighs) (car beeping) - Okay. Ah, keys are here. (car starting) Yes! It started. Everything's here? - Yeah, we got everything. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome, no problem. You be careful now. It's really nice to see a married couple get along so well. I think you two will last. Have you guys been married a long time? - Too long. - Too long. (Tom laughing) That's funny. Okay look, I'm really sorry about the things I said earlier. I was out of line, I didn't mean those things. I was just frustrated. - Yeah, me too. I'm sorry I called you a candy-assed jerkwad. - No, you didn't call me that. You called me an asshole. - Well, I'm sorry. And I'm sorry I called you a raging buffoon. - But yeah, asshole. - Oh yeah. Totally. - Friends? - Besties. I'm Besty Betty. - Ah, jeez. Okay, let's get outta here. Oh what? - I think we have a flat. - A friggin' flat. - Can you pop the trunk? - Huh? - Don't worry, let the expert handle it. - [Tom] What're you doin'? - Okay. - Okay. - All right, can you grab the donut? - Donuts are tasty. - You know what? Why don't you go sit in the car? I got it. (Tom sighs) - You know, I have a little bit of cell service here. I could call AAA. You don't have to do this. - Don't worry about it. I'll have it done in no time. - Manly thing. Hey? Hey. - Yeah. - [Tom] You've done this before, yeah? - Well, when you're married to a guy who isn't handy, you kinda gotta learn these things. (Tom laughing) - Hey? (Tom laughs) Looks like I have something in common with him. I'm not much of a mechanic, myself. - Oh, maybe I can teach you sometime. - Hey? I just might take you up on that. - Okay. - Hey, I'm just kiddin', go back to it. (Kelly laughing) Okay. - Okay. I think we are in business. - Yeah, I think you might need this. - Oh, thank you. Better? - Kinda, yeah. Hey, that was impressive. - Yeah, my dad was a car nut. I learned how to do an oil change when I was six. - That's pretty awesome. Jessica has no idea what a jack is, let alone knowing how to use one. - Yeah, well, maybe I should take a cue from Jessica. Seems to be working for her. - I think you're just fine as you are. Being you has its advantages. - Hey, did you mean what you said earlier, when you told me that I'm pretty? (Tom clearing throat) (Kelly gasping) (both laughing) Oh no! - Yeah, I meant it. Uh-huh, let's get outta here. Okay. (insects chirping) (owl hooting) (Kelly inhales) - Oh, what is it now? - The road's closed for construction at night. I checked the map, and it's like 100 miles to go any other way. I don't know, I guess we're gonna have to find a place to stay around here. Our adventure with the scarecrow ate up a chunk of time. - Where are we gonna stay? I haven't seen a sign for a motel or anything for a while. - I don't know, I saw sign a while back for a campground, you know, log cabins and stuff. I don't know, there probably aren't a lot of choices right now. - I mean, I guess that's gonna have to do. I'm actually really hungry. I hope they have food. I'm kind of scared of campgrounds. Well, bears, actually. - Bears? Well, there probably aren't many around right now, they have the whole forest. We'll be all right. Let's do this. (bird hooting) So I think we're in the right spot. - Yeah, I think so. - Hey buddy, come on in. - All right, gonna go on in. - Good luck. (bird hooting) - [Ranger] How ya doin'? - I'm good, so we're looking for a place to stay, maybe some food? - Our restaurant just closed, but I tell you what, I got some burritos for you. Let me find 'em, here, there you go. A couple of greasy burritos. - Sounds good, yeah. (insects chirping) - Cabins are all full, but I got a tent. It's a honeymoon suite. And it's really nice, it's up here in Lover's Lane. It's got a single bed. It's got fluffy pillows. Nice, fluffy blankets, that are really nice and cozy. I think you'll like it. We'll even throw in something really even special. The hero package. Oh yeah. - Okay what's the hero package? - Well, let me tell you, the hero package, you ready for this? That hero package, all right? You get her all ready to go. I mean look at her, how pretty she is, all right. You get her all nice and cozy and comfortable, all right, and I'll be outside and I'll be the bear. Okay, you see all the signs, beware of the bear? - Yeah. - Well, I'll be the bear and I'll get everything all rustled, and I'll make the noises, and everything. When you hear that, you come on outside. And then when you come outside, and you see me, I'll take off. You turn around and go back in, be the big stud, and be the hero. (bird howling) - Really, does that work? - Oh yeah. Oh yeah, every time, look at her. She's ready. She wants you. Okay, you just, you gotta do this. - You know it's okay. - Let me tell you, you need to do this, this is the hero package, you're a hero. Look at her. - Yeah, I know. - She likes you, she's a pretty thing. - I see where you're coming from, but it's okay, you don't have to do it. - Okay, you need to think about it. - That's all right, I'm gonna take the burritos. - All right, well, you have a good night. - Yeah. I'm gonna go, and thank you for everything. - You got it, all right, all right. Be safe out there. - Thank you. - Watch out for them bears. - Yeah, thank you. - All right. (chuckles) (car door dinging) - Okay, so I think we're all set. Interesting guy. (chuckles) (Kelly gasping) Him. - Hey darlin'. - Hi. - Didn't I just see you lookin' at my legs as I was coming up here? Aww, just teasin'. (both laughing) Naw, I just want to make sure you guys are safe, and you know, from all them bears. You know, we're all on the front lines taking care of everybody here, you civilians, and you know, it's not an easy job. - Aren't you just a park ranger? - Well, government official. Whatever. You know, the Navy Seals, Marines, they come to me for training. So, you know, you gotta just understand that it's a different life out here, you know. But hey, how about a kiss? (bird hooting) Oh, nah, just kiddin', got you again. Hey, if this guy's not doin' his job, you know where to find me. If he ain't givin' you the you-know-what, then you come knock on my cabin, I'll take care of you. You guys have a safe night. Take care, spunky. - The you-know-what? Spunky! Can you believe this guy? What a nut! I can't believe he was hittin' on you right in front of me. - Oh I don't know, I think he'd kinda cute. I do love a man in uniform. - You're sick. Sick sick sick sick. (insects chirping) - God, those burritos were so good. I was starving. You know, those burritos might be the best thing I ever tasted. You know, this is really beautiful, for a tent. - Yeah, sorry about this. The tent and one bed. I'm gonna make a bed just over here. - Actually, I'm kinda scared of the bears. It is a little chilly. I think you should just sleep in the bed, too. Nothing funny, just two friends, camping out, keeping safe and warm. - Okay, I mean, I guess that's okay. We're friends, right? We both have significant others, or significant maybes, or something like that. So, yeah let's go ahead. - Okay, oh sorry. Sorry. - This is nice. Comfy. - I actually am a little chilly. Do you mind if I move closer? - No, that's fine. I mean, we should, we can, we must, stay warm. (gentle music) (creature growling) (twigs snapping) - Oh my god, it's a bear. Yep, definitely a bear. Okay, I'm scared. - You know what? It's fine, I'm gonna handle this. - Wait, what? - I'm gonna handle this. - You cannot go out there. (tense music) - Don't worry, I got this. - What are you doing? Are you nuts? Come back here! Tom! - Get outta here! Go, get going! Get going, bear! I'm a coming now, get going! (bear growling) (Tom screaming) It's a bear. That was a bear. - Don't worry, I got this. - What are you doing? (bear growling) (banging dishes) - No, not today! Not today! - Yes! Yes! Woo! That was one crazy bear. (Tom groans) - [Tom] Crazy. - Wow, I guess we'd better get some sleep. I feel so much warmer now. Good night. - Crazy. (bird hooting) That was a real bear. It was a real furry bear. (birds chirping) - You're really quiet this morning. - Sorry, I'm just getting kinda nervous. The big moment's almost here. - Yeah, big moment. - So, do you think you and your ex will get back together? - Stranger things have happened. Why? - [Tom] I don't know, I just want to see you with someone who's gonna make you happy. Hey, on your honeymoon, what was your wish at the well? Well? - Sorry. Actually, I wished that our first child would be born happy and healthy. - [Tom] I'm sorry to bring up tough times. - What about you, Tom? You want kids some day? - [Tom] I don't know, you know, with everything that's going on right now, I haven't given it much thought, but under the right circumstances, I wouldn't rule it out. Hey, you want one? - [Kelly] It's 8:00 in the morning. Why not? (Kelly coughing) - Hey, you okay? (Kelly coughing) - [Kelly] Do these have peanuts in them? - Yeah, why? - I'm allergic to peanuts. You know that! - No, I didn't. - Tom! - [Tom] Oh my god. Oh my god! Okay, just hang in there, I'm gonna get to a hospital, okay? Kelly? (tense music) - Your girlfriend will be fine. We just gave her a shot of adrenaline, and we're gonna keep her overnight for observation. Peanut allergies can just be a little tricky. - She's not my... - Excuse me? - Can I see my girlfriend, now? Is that? - Yeah, go ahead and go right in here. - Thank you. Are you okay? We've gotta stop meeting like this. - I'm allergic to peanuts. - So I hear. - Look, Tom. Sorry I ruined everything. - No, you didn't. - Good luck with Jessica. I really want you two to be happy. - You do? - Isn't that what you want? When you get back to San Diego, I'd really like to talk to you, okay? - About what? - I want to tell you about my husband. - I want to talk to you too, about something. (knocking on door) - Sorry, we just need some blood. - I'll be fine, I'll be out tomorrow. Go do what you have to do. - Are you sure? - I'll be fine, Tom. - Take care, Betty. - It's Kelly. - I know.

(clearing throat) All good? - Yeah, I'm a little dizzy. I'll be fine, let's go inside. - [Jessica] Sure. - [Tom] There you go. (light jazz music) (crowd murmuring) - [Jessica] And the work has been spectacular, I'm so happy. I mean, yeah, it's really good. - Great, so what else is new? - Yeah, so I've been with the local network, WTC here, for four years. And I've been doing a morning show and it's really fantastic. I mean, everybody loves the show, and yeah, this one year we had a bus, and my face was on the bus for like a whole year. Everybody got to know me, it was really rewarding. - That's great, sounds like the town really agrees with you. - Oh my god, I love it here, it's great. It's, yeah. What about you? What have you been up to for the last five years? - Well, that's the thing. I don't know. I was in a car accident. It was really bad. I was in a coma for 11 months. - Wow. - And when I woke up, it felt like 2013, except it was 2018. - Crazy. So what's the last thing you remember? (Tom sighs) - Going to the jewelry store, to pick up a ring. - [Waiter] Excuse me, let me go ahead and get you two some more water. Can I get you anything else to drink? Possibly some wine, champagne, cocktails. - I'll do a glass of cab. - [Waiter] Cabernet, of course, not a problem. Coming up for you. Can I get you anything else to drink? Cocktail, wine, champagne? - Whatever she's having is fine. - [Waiter] All right, two cabernet, coming right up. - Thank you. Are you sure you're okay? You don't look so good. - [Waiter] Cabernet, two for you. - Oh thank you. - [Waiter] Here's two glasses of cabernet for you. Please enjoy. - Sorry, I'm fine. A toast. To new beginnings. - I'll drink to that. (crowd murmuring) Yeah, you wanna come in? I live upstairs. - Good little work out, huh? - Especially after that dinner. That was nice, thank you for that. Nice restaurant. Come on in. - Wow, this is really nice. - Oh thank you, you like it? Thank you. - Yeah. - My little paradise. Well, yeah. Why don't you make yourself comfortable? - Sure. - I've got a great bottle of pinot noir, you still like pinot noir, right? - Yes, I do. I'll just look around, check it out. This is pretty great. - Thanks. - Very nice. So you like it here, huh? - [Jessica] Yeah, I love it. - Thank you. - My pleasure. Cheers, and thank you for dinner, Tom. - Yeah, my pleasure. (clearing throat) Look, Jessica I have something to ask you. - Sure, go ahead. - What happened? - What do you mean? - To us. - Oh, that. - Yeah, that. - Well, I was young and afraid. - Afraid of what? - I was afraid of you being my last. I was afraid of not dating anybody else, of not ever having that first kiss. - But you married the other guy. - I was young and stupid. Now I'm mature and I know what I want. - Make a wish. - What's wrong? - Can I use your bathroom? - Sure. It's right there. Down the corridor. (Tom exhaling) (waves crashing) (water running) - There's a chick. It's just, it's a little complicated. - This one actually looks exactly like the one that my husband and I saw in Ireland on our honeymoon. I want all your wishes to come true. - Kelly, it's always been Kelly. (knocking on door) - Coming. - [Man] Hey. - Hey. - Hey, you look amazing. - [Jessica] What are you doing here? - I was just by the gym, and I thought I'd stop by and see my girl. - You can't right now, can I please call you later? I'm in the middle of some. - Why are you pushing me off like this? - Can you please go? I'm in the middle of something here. You can call me later, okay? - [Man] In the middle of something. - [Jessica] Babe babe. - Whoa whoa. - You need to go, Eric, please. - What's, what's going on? - Is this your husband? No no no no, if you won't tell him, then I will. - [Jessica] Eric, please. It's not what you think. - Your wife and I are in love. I'm sorry you have to hear it from me, but I'm tired of screwing around behind your back. - No, I'm not her husband. Jessica, I thought you were divorced. - I might have exaggerated a bit. - So who the hell are you? - Someone who's just leaving. - Wait Tom, please? Please, I'm sorry, my life is really complicated right now. I want to explain it to you, and I want to make it up to you, because I want us to have a fresh start. - You know what? I can't. I'm in love with someone else. - What? And you had to come all the way here to tell me that? - It took me coming here to realize that. And I have you to thank for it. Have a good life, Jessica. (light music) - Hello? - Hey, you still in San Francisco? - Actually I'm at the airport. I'm about to board a plane home. How did things go with Jessica? - I'll tell you about it when I see you. Hey, we really need to talk. I'm gonna take a flight out tomorrow. - You're breaking up. - Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. (airplane engine roaring) (Tom exhaling) (ominous music) (Tom crying) - We are here in the presence of God to witness and bless the union of this man and woman in holy matrimony. Tom, will you have Kelly for your wife? Will you love and comfort and keep her, forsaking all others, and remain true to her, for as long as you both shall live? - I will. - Will you, Kelly, have Tom to be your husband? Will you love him, comfort and keep him, and forsaking all others, remain true to him, as long as you both shall live? - [Kelly] I will. - [Minister] Tom has a few words he would like to say. Tom? (clearing throat) - So, I know this is a bit of a surprise, but I wrote a few things down. Okay, I know I'm not always great with words, so I really wanted to make sure I got this right. I wanted to tell you what is obvious, to anyone that knows you. You are the most caring, loving person I have ever met. For a very long time, I gave up on love. I even gave up on the idea that love exists. (clearing throat) You, gave me the ability to dream again. You showed me the only thing more joyful than a young heart, is a broken one that learns to love again. - I'm sorry. - What happened to us? - At first, the doctor said it would be best if we introduced our marriage slowly. But stupid me. I wanted to see if I could make you fall in love with me all over again. - Why? - I was pregnant when we got married. We lost the baby. (Tom crying) - Sorry. - I just wanted to see if your love was real. (Tom crying) But... I wanted to tell you... If you truly love Jessica, you want to be together, then I won't stand in the way. - I came here to tell you my wish came true. - What wish? - That day, at the wishing well. I wished that by the end of the week, I would be with a woman that I loved for the rest of my life. Slowly, the pieces are coming together. You know, like a picture coming into focus. And as it clears, I just, all I see... Is you. Oh, god. We're still married, right? - Yes. - Good. (dramatic orchestral music) - Wow. That felt like a first kiss. - It was. I don't want it to be the last. You know, the good thing about losing your memory for five years is I get to fall in love with you all over again. I get to see how amazing you are, all over again. I love you.

It's Holly. Hello. - Hi Holly. - Tom, Tom, Tom, guess what? I'm not gonna go to law school, I just came up with the best job ever. - Okay. - Guys, you would never believe what just happened to me.
