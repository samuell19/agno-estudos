Forget it, Monezza, you can't repair that piece of junk! - Give me a hand. - Why don't you sell it? - You can always get fifty notes for it. - Come and push. I'll give you a push if you keep slacking like that... Do you think this is a charity? Are you trying to run me into the ground? People like you, even if someone tries to help you... You'll always be in the shit! Why do you have to shout at me? Why do you have to shout at me? Leave us alone! So we're unlucky! You want a bet the day shit becomes gold they'll take our asses away! - What a riot! - What are you talking about? What bet? Go bet on the horses! - Go and clean Mr. Cornachia's car. - On my way. You've been playing with that screwdriver for three hours! Why don't you do something? You go over there, and calm down. What the fuck... Hey, dumb-ass. Don't you recognise me? Vince! Weren't you in Corsica? - I came back. - That's great. I raised a little hell, so I had to come back. - Jump in, let's go for a ride. - Look at you! I'm glad you came back! Easy! You'll break my glasses! - They're originals. - Let's get it on! The boss can go to hell! Are you upset? ls something wrong? Do you remember that job I did at the Credit Bank? - You remember that cop? - Sure I do... Sam... Commissioner Sam. - Sarti wants me dead. - Then you kill him! I wish. We all have our own ways: I wouldn't let Alain Delon touch me! Ursula, they should give you the best bitch Oscar for that one! That's a good one. We have a client. Check him out. - What's your name? - Ursula Lopresti Salvatore, why? You see this... Solid gold, quartz... Twenty a piece. - I've already got one. - Then buy another one. - Why should I? - Because yours stopped at eleven. And when did yours stop? Don't worry, beautiful, mine always strikes at midday. Lucky you, if you believe that! Mind your own business! Don't shout at me, Vince, I don't like it... I don't like that idiot trying to be all sophisticated. - Mind your own fucking business! - Fuck the pair of you! Okay, there are another nineteen in here, twenty in total... You make five a piece. You have to sell them for two hundred each, got it? - But they're fakes! - They're fakes? What you got there is real? Listen, handsome, this one goes all the way to 2000! All the way to 2000? If you want to make it to 2000, you'd better sell them. Do the right thing. Okay. Sure. You can count on me. He's going to kill you... He's going to kill you! That's my fire! What the fuck are you doing? I'm taking a leak. I don't mean to upset you but I'll be cold tonight. I can warm you up. - Are you from Naples? - Yes. I'm a hunchback, I can bring you good luck. - How much? - 5000 in the car, 10,000 on the lawn... - And 15,000 at my place, well? - Let's go to your place. Come on. Hurry up. What a nice car! I bet you earn a lot. - Wait, Vince! - What do you want? Wait, I'm coming with you. I don't need you to hold my dick! Bye, Vince. Vince! It's so pretty! I don't know how to thank you. - Come on, Marie, you know it's fake. - Sure, but it's the thought that counts. What thought? I've never been the sentimental type. I don't know... It's embarrassing. I never liked all that. - Can I see you again? - Sure, whenever you like... And if I'm not here, you know where to find me. You'll be here... You know why you'll be here? Because as long as I'm around... You'll have whatever you need. - Okay? - Okay, Vince. - How did you get here? - That transvestite gave me the address... The one with the watches. - What do you want? - I want to be with you. And I want to be alone. - I don't need you watching over me. - That's why I'm here... - I can help you. - Don't worry, I can take care of myself. Scram. It's already ten. Are you sure he's coming? Of course. He said ten. No, thanks, I don't drink. I've got an ulcer. - Hi, Vince. - Bonsoir! It's been a while. - Sogliola. - Hi, Vince. Him as well... Weren't you in Albania? - I can't go back to Albania. - You hear that? We're so tight here they even come from Albania to take a piece of our action. - Can I offer you a drink? - Never, never... It's on me... You see that? Carmine. A bottle, please. Right away, Vince. You did well for yourself in Corsica. - As they say, not bad! - How long did you stay in Corsica? 16, 18, months... Long enough to perfect my French. You did your military service. He's good, Sogliola, you can't beat him, and he's funny, too. That's a good one, you remind me of my brother, Monezza... You know Monezza? Gauloises? - No, thanks. - Gauloises? Already got one, thanks. Can I? Sure. Listen, Vince, aside from not getting arrested, what other plans do you have? To make some money. With your help. Me, Sogliola, and the Albanian are okay with that... But times have changed, you need to use your brain. Of course you do, or I wouldn't fucking be here. I've got a gig that could bag us between six to seven hundred million... - Interested? - Of course we're interested. There's a Bank of Rome van... And every Monday, at exactly midday... They deliver the wages, in cash, to the branch on Via Catalani... There's very little traffic on that road... All we need are two cars, and the rest is easy. How many guards? Let's see, there's one in the back, and one next to the driver. I'll take care of them. Albanian... Don't bust my balls! Leave this to me, we don't want any itchy trigger fingers... Got it? There's no need for a shoot-out. - Then what do we use? Water pistols? - No, we're going to use these. What is it? It's a gas bomb, you throw it at them... And less than five seconds later... The guards are asleep. They don't even have time to call for help... And they spit out so much smoke you can't see more than a metre in front of you. It's true. - Are you in? - Yes, I'm in. I'm in as well. Albanian, what about you? Okay. Then so am I. Sarti, did you bring us something nice from Sicily? Fuck you. - Valenzi. - You're just in time... It's still hot. - Do you want a biscuit? - Sure I do! It was an overnight train, I didn't sleep a wink. How was Trapani? The women? - Valenzi, don't you think of anything else? - It's a small defect, I like the ladies. Tell me about the Hunchback, isn't that why I'm here? That's your problem. I heard you're the one who caught his accomplices. - But he got away. - You can make up for that... Our informants tell us he's back in Rome. We need to identify the safe houses he might still have in the area. It won't be easy, they won't hand over someone like him. We'll look at these first: Ciacci Carmine: Fence... He owns a wine cellar in Tufello. Mancini, Ugo: Pimp. No fixed address... Di Gennaro, Mario, alias: Sogliola. Under investigation for robbery... He works in a frozen food warehouse. Dalmi, Federico: Gambler... Marazzi, Sergio, alias: Monezza. The Hunchback's twin brother... Let's start by keeping an eye on Monezza. Come on. - Hi, Vince. - Back again, Monezza? I went to see the transvestites to get the money for the watches... Four grand. What are you trying to prove? - What the fuck are you trying to prove? - I'm not trying to prove anything... What have I got to prove? I just wanted to remind you of what mum used to say, that we should stick together. Mum told you that, she didn't say that to me. You know what she meant? To keep an eye on me... Because I was born different, that's what mum was trying to say... But I wanted to show mum that I could handle myself in this stinking world. Don't talk like that... You're inventing things! I'm not inventing a fucking thing! Cut me some slack... Even if we are twins, you listen to me... I was born first, okay? Alone! You came out ten minutes later. Those ten minutes make me your older brother... And as your older brother you have to listen to me... And I'm telling you to quit hassling me, Monezza! Okay, there's no need to be angry. Okay, Vince, I'm going. I'm going. - Do you really want to help me? - Sure I do. I'll tell you how and when, but I'll call you! Don't get involved. I'll call you. - I know what I'm doing. - Okay. Bye, Vince. Mr. Perrone! - Is it going down tomorrow? - Yes, it's all ready... The bombs, the gas masks... We even have two clean cars. Don't worry, it will all go smoothly. There's just one problem: they'll recognise the Hunchback... With all the cops looking for him, it's going to make life difficult for us... - We're taking a big risk. - Okay, but it was his idea. I'm putting up the money, and I don't feel like going to prison. - There is one way... - Sure, with all that smoke around... If one of you happens to shoot him, and he goes down... Then we split it three ways. Or am I mistaken? You know what, Sogliola? For once you're right! Here they come. When they open the back door, we go in. Don't worry. - Have you got the masks? - They're ready. - Are you sure you got him? - How do I know? I couldn't see a thing! Come on, step on it! Marshall, look, it hasn't been fired. How could you let that damned hunchback get away? Albanian shot him. He's probably wounded... - With all that gas around. - It was chaos. The chaos starts when he turns up here... Why? He didn't see me. He'll think it was one of the guards. The Albanian is right. What are you worried about? - They probably already got him. - Maybe, but we need to stay alert. - I don't think so. - You're not scared of that cripple. Let's just enjoy the money. We all take our own share... This calls for a drink! - Cheers. - Cheers. Vince! What happened to you? Jesus! What did you do? I fucked up. Turn on the shower. Call me back when you have something more concrete. - Sit down, Monezza. - No, I'm sorry... My friends call me Monezza. To strangers I'm Marazzi, Sergio. - Got it? - Have a seat, Marazzi. Well? Do you know where your brother is? the Hunchback? Commissioner, I don't like the name Hunchback... Let's face it he's straighter than you and me put together... - My brother's name is Vincenzo Marazzi. - Okay, do you know where Vincenzo Marazzi is? - I have no idea, do you? - Yes, I do. - Then tell me. - I don't know where he is right now... But yesterday he was at 17 Via Catalini, outside the headquarters of the Bank of Rome. I get it... But are you sure he was outside the bank, or do you just think he was? I think he was. It's one thing to think it, it's another thing to be sure... You can't accuse someone because you think they were there. - Listen, when did you last see him? - Vince... I haven't seen Vince for a while... Every now and then I have to look in the mirror to remind myself of what he looks like. Sarti, we've got something... It's the forensics report. - Marazzi, wait for me next door. - Sure, Commissioner. The prints on the gun and the ones inside the van belong to Vincenzo Marazzi... - The Hunchback of Rome. - I knew it... Now we know who stole the money. - We have to get him. - It's much easier now, just follow him. My lighter... Monezza! - Where is the man I was questioning? - The bathroom, he said he had to go. - Shall I get him? - He's long gone by now. Now there are two fugitives. - You remember what you have to do? - Of course, just relax, Vince. Tell me again. I'll go to your friend, I tell him you sent me... I'll give him the money and get him to deliver a Magnum.38 with ammo, okay? - You got it. - Can I go? - Be good. - Yes, and don't open the door to anyone. Don't worry, Marie... - Are you the manager? - Yes. Show me your license. We're checking some of the local clubs. Okay, Commissioner... Vince... If you don't kill all three of them, then this time you're real idiot. You got it? To you, Vince... Cheers. Nothing, Vince. I couldn't even talk to him... There were two patrol cars outside and it was full of cops inside... I tried to get something anyway, I got one from a toy shop. It's good for robberies as well. Come here. - It's cold tonight. - Freezing. - Goodnight - Goodnight. Frozen food supplies... Hello? Hello? Need a light? Good evening... Sogliola! I'm glad you came. I looked for you, you know. I looked everywhere for you... - I have to explain what happened. - Go ahead. It's not my fault. It was them... They forced me to do it, but the money they gave me... I kept it for you. It's yours! Where is it? In the office. - What is it? - Nothing, don't worry about it... It means it's finished cooling... If I don't reset the timer, it will all go to ruin. Sure... Go on. Fifty tons of sole will defrost... Not to mention all the other stuff... Can I? Excuse me, I won't be long. What are you doing? Open. Open it! I don't want to die! You can't do this to me! - Hello? - Hello. - Who's speaking? - It's me Perrone, the Hunchback. - I'm here with a friend, Sogliola. - Sogliola! What's Sogliola up to? How is he? Unfortunately, Sogliola has a bit of a cold. But I'm hot. - Aren't you hot? - Hot? Why should I be hot? Just a thought... "An urgent call for 564-9672" It's for you, Perrone. It might be something urgent. At this hour? Yes, yes... I'll see you round. Goodnight, buddy. Hot? Why should I be hot? I'm cool as a cucumber. Hello? Yes, speaking. What? Stop, where are you going? You're not allowed through. Let me pass, that's my showroom! Calm down. Come on, do something. My business is going up in smoke! Get out of here. Can't you feel how hot it is? There as well, the window. Come on, and increase the pressure. Monezza... - There's a call for you. - Tell them I've been fired. He says he's a relative. - Where are you? - Don't worry about that... - You have to do me a favour. - As many as you like, what is it? - Can you find me an Albanian? - Albanian? Yes, but immediately, because it's urgent. Let me think, Vince, I know a couple... Let's see... How about tomorrow at midday? - That's fine. - Okay, tomorrow at midday then. Everything okay? Be careful, Vince. Don't worry about me, just do as I said. I found him. This is my brother. Mr. Marazzi. You can trust him. Osvaldo Albanian, from Frascati... - It's a real pleasure. - Not for me. - Vince! - Are you kidding? - I asked for a real Albanian. - What's wrong with him? His name is Albanian... Osvaldo Albanian. - Show him your I.D. card. - There's no need. Sorry. Didn't you say you wanted to help me? Then help me properly... Find me a real Albanian, from Albania, not from Frascati. - Okay, but where do I find one? - That's your fucking problem! 'Albanian Embassy' Hello? Albanian Consulate. Passport office, can I help you? - Are you Marie Engver? - Yes, that's me. You were born in Albania, right? Of course, my name's Engver, and I'm an Albanian citizen. - You're married to a Benito Giua, right? - Yes, why? Because we've kidnapped Benito Giua, and you've got a problem. We got it. Yves Saint Laurent... Not bad! Excuse me... Excuse me, please... - Go ahead. - I don't speak Italian... Please help me. You're Albanian like me. How lucky, will you help me? I've only been in Rome a few days... I don't know the city and I can't find my hotel... - If you don't mind, I can show you. - Great! Thanks! Go on ahead, I'll meet you at the usual place. What a lady! You know what... I bet she'll take him straight to heaven! It was either drugs or someone with a score to settle. - Have you found the weapon? - Nothing, we're searching the area... - We might find the shells. - If he was killed here. Contact headquarters and notify the District Attorney. Milo Dragovich, born in Albania. Sentenced twice for fraud... Once for assault, and suspected of attempted robbery... - Guess who with? - There are at least 10,000 robbers in Rome. Precisely, Valenzi... And the Albanian was also suspected of armed robbery along with one Mario Di Gennaro... Alias: Sogliola. Who also died recently in suspicious circumstances... - Does it tell you anything? - Sure it does... - Sogliola was friends with the Hunchback. - They robbed that security van... And the Hunchback killed them to keep all the money. It makes sense, but I don't think it ends there... Someone must be helping him. Listen, Valenzi, we can't just hang around waiting for another body to turn up. Who cares? Let them kill each other! What upsets me is that the Hunchback didn't ask us for permission. Give me a light. Come on, get to work, or I'll have you transferred to Africa. We've done a good job. None of them have any I.D. Good. Turn around. What do you want? I have to go to work. - And where would that be? - At the circus, I'm Rin Tin Tin... I've been working there for more than twenty years. You think I don't work? I've got four pairs of shoes to repair by tomorrow. - I have to work as well. - Calm down. Send them home. Hurry up. I have to be careful, you know there are a lot of cops around lately. Precisely. Find my brother... And tell him to swallow a couple of cigarettes if the cops pick him up. - With or without a filter? - How the hell do I know? Look, this isn't a joke. I'm just the messenger. Okay, if he tells me I've got to eat them then I'll eat them... But I want to know what will happen after I've eaten the cigarettes? You'll come down with a fever. Speaking of which... He also said to be careful when it hits you... - Watch what you say. - Listen, tell Vince not to worry. Okay, I told you. Be careful. And tell my brother I'd eat a whole carton in one go if he asked me to. Okay, I'll tell him. How do I do this? Do you have ones without a filter so I don't get it wrong. Great. Monezza, the cops are coming. Get out of here. - What are you doing? - I want to eat it alone, okay? You were standing two metres away from them and you didn't see or hear anything. - No, I didn't see anything. - You didn't see anything. What's wrong with him? We found him collapsed on the floor, he was cold and shaking... And he hasn't said a word until now. - I'm dying! - He has a fever, sit him down. - What's wrong, Monezza? - I'm dying... I'm dying... I'm not dying, I'm already dead! There's Jesus. You're so beautiful, Jesus. Just like in the Bible. You know they're making a lot of money out of you back on Earth... You were really successful... More than King Kong! - Commissioner, he's out of his mind. - Quiet, let him speak! Listen, Marazzi, why don't you tell Jesus where your brother is? He can put him on the right path, otherwise he's going straight to Hell. Jesus... The Devil wants to know where my brother is... You hear that? But he can't judge him, that's your job. Right, Jesus? You said so yourself. 'He who casts the first stone' Right, Jesus? It's them... They're the Devils! They want to send me to Hell. - That's enough! - Why is it enough? They tell us to study... They tell us to work... But what right do they have to judge my brother? Because you said the last will be first. But nobody's perfect, Jesus. Not even you... Because you forgot to mention that the last will be the first on Earth... Then they'll see! That's right, Jesus! I need an ambulance, immediately. "Attention: The jeweler has been seriously injured..." "I repeat: There were three robbers..." They escaped in an unidentified red Fiat Giulia... There has been a sighting of the car in the Verano district... "Set up roadblocks in sectors two, three, and seven..." Okay, Commissioner Sarti has arrived, over and out. We found the red Fiat Giulia abandoned outside a building so stay alert... - They may still be in the area. - Don't worry, chief. Your license... You son of a bitch! Calling all cars, this is Commissioner Sarti. It's a white 127, license plate: A77-510. - What do you want? - I'll tell you... Take him to my office, he might be connected to the robbery You're gonna talk to me... Rats like you are real easy to break. Look, the car is registered to a Milo Dragovich... Isn't he the guy who was murdered last week? The Albanian. The car is registered in your name, as the owner. And I sold it seven months ago, it's written there. This Milo Dragovich, alias: 'The Albanian', who bought the car... How well did you know him? Listen, Commissioner, I sell cars... Well, I used to... That was my job. I can't remember all my customers. You understand. Yes, but what I don't understand is why they set light to your dealership... Do you happen to have any enemies? I assure you've I've never seen that man you stopped in the car. I didn't ask you about him, I just want to know if you have any enemies? - Certainly not. - Then how do you explain the fire? Jealousy, Commissioner. One of my rivals got a little envious. And you think the Albanian and Mario Di Gennaro, alias Sogliola... Were also killed out of jealousy or by competing rivals? What do you think? I don't think anything, I can only remind you that I have a clean record. Get out of here! Listen, Mr. Perrone. When did you last hear from the Hunchback? Well? I'm sure he was behind the armoured van robbery... - Let's keep him under surveillance. - What's the point? Either we get the Hunchback, or the Hunchback gets us. Carmine, my friend... We need to be careful now... - Because Perrone is well protected. - Vince, you can trust me... That's Romolo. That's Gigi. And that's the Fox... They call him that because he's smart and quick... They're the best in town. I spoke to the guys at the garage, they told me they got your brother... A cop car pulled up, they grabbed him and took him away. - Where did they take him? - How do I know? It's a mystery... I've been searching all morning, my feet are killing me... There's no trace of him, he isn't at the precinct or any of the jails. - Listen, you need to get out of here. - Calm down, calm down... Guys, I want you to find out where the hell my brother is... - Do what it takes. - Don't worry. Let's go. I knew it would end like this... I knew it. Let's hope he hasn't messed things up. 'Saint Mary of Mercy Psychiatric Hospital' - How do you feel, Marazzi? - I feel better... But I can't see too well. I can see better now, but my arms are all twisted. Your arms are twisted because you're wearing a straitjacket. What the fuck are you doing? You can't do this! - Calm down. - Calm down, my ass! - Why? - Because you're in psychiatric hospital. - Why? - You're crazy! Where are you taking me? Please, Marazzi, have a seat. We brought you here to assess you health... Everything appears to be in order: Your heart is fine, as is your liver... Your blood pressure is a little high, but it's well within the limits. - Then I can go? - Not yet, we need to do another test. - What for? - No, it isn't difficult... I'll say some words and you have to tell me the first thing that comes into your mind... - Understood? - Of course, I'm not stupid. You must answer immediately! Pussy. - Pardon? - Pussy, you get it? Listen, Marazzi, I ask the questions and not vice-versa. - Who's vice-versa? - Vice-Versa isn't anyone... It means I ask the questions and you answer... For example; I say black and you say white, without thinking... - Do we understand one another? - Yes, I think so. Okay. Flower. Pussy. Listen, Marazzi, I don't have time to play games. Because I do? You think I have time to waste? You think I want to play games? I don't get it... You lock me up from morning till night, what do you expect me to say? - I don't know... Mozzarella? - Very well... Then let's continue... Hunchback! - Straight. - Strike. Garlic. Horn. - Doctor. - Fool. - Fuck you. - Asshole. Fuck you and your mother! - Nurses, hurry. - To hell with the nurses, I'm not crazy! - Solitary confinement. - Doctor, you made me say it! You can't do this. I'm not crazy! Call Commissioner Sarti, tell him he tested positive in the psychiatric test... The patient, Marazzi Sergio, displays signs of paranoia and acute schizophrenia... Therefore he must remain here for an indefinite period of time. 'Doctor JH Bassan, Dentist' Good morning. Punctual as always! And you're always cute! Every Tuesday and Friday, from four to four thirty... If you ask me he's got more false teeth than real ones. - What's the street like? - It's one way, quiet... - At that hour, at least. - When this is all over... I promise I'll take you to one of those chic restaurants. - Really? - Sure. Chic sounds good. You know what I'd like? - What would you like? - To go dancing some place nice... Chic, just like you said... Somewhere like Jackie O. - You want to dance at the Jackie O? - Yes, but with you. Sure, with me, I'll take you dancing at the Jackie O. - Really. - You're great! What the hell... - Who is it? - It's the Fox. - Come in. - Hi, Marie. Good news... - They found Monezza. - Where is he? At Saint Mary's, with the lunatics. Good news, they just caught the flame-thrower gang. Who cares? Listen, Valenzi, I've had an idea... Can you recommend an agent who can pretend he's crazy... - So we can plant him in the asylum? - I don't get it. It's simple, I want to put him next to Marazzi... And get them to prepare a nice little escape plan together. You think Monezza will try to make contact his brother? - Precisely. - So you'll kill two birds with one stone. The only bird I'm interested in is the Hunchback. I think I've got just the man. He works for the drug squad, he's good. Get me the drug squad, I want to speak to Romeo Esposito... Yes, Esposito! - I'm in a hurry! - Where you going? - To work, at the post office. - They're on strike. Strike! They're on strike! I can go back to bed! Damned freak! Cigarette? - What sort? - Export with a filter. I don't like filters. Nice day, isn't it? - If you say so. - Listen, don't tell anyone... I'm not crazy, I'm the president of Petrol Gas. I get it. A pleasure, Scaraguli Giuseppe. No, you're not going! Let go of me... Come on, don't be like that. You know something, you're starting to get on my nerves... - So... - No, you're not going. - Why not? - Because I know who you are... You stole the Shah's petrol! - You're inventing things. - I'm not inventing anything... You stole it and you've hidden it in Vetralla or Arcinazzo. I haven't hidden a damned thing in Vetralla or Arcinazzo. No, listen... - Don't get upset. - What do you want? I've got an idea... Listen... I know a way out of here. If you listen to me, we can be out of here in a couple of days... And you can show me where the petrol is. Okay? I'll think about it... Careful, the guard's coming. Get me some cigarettes. - Sorry, I thought you were the other one. - My cousin broke her foot... I'm taking her place for a couple of days... - Please, come in. - Thank you. - Are you as good as your cousin? - Modestly speaking, I'm a lot better... Don't worry, you're in safe hands. Make yourself comfortable. Thanks. - The doctor? - Next door, he's getting the tools ready. - There's no need, a tissue will do. - No, you don't want to dirty your suit. - Thank god it's my last filling. - You won't need any more after this. - Who's that? - The doctor, his mouth hurts as well. Be quiet! - The doctor? - The doctor's coming, he's on his way. Vince! What are you going to do? Which tooth is it that hurts? Which tooth hurts? 'Car Dealer Adalberto Marie Perrone Dies of a Heart Attack in the Dentist's Chair' Commissioner Sarti, I've got Esposito on the line. - Go ahead, Esposito. - He went for it, Commissioner... I can't say much but we're going to escape tonight at three. - Are you sure? - Yes, I've organised everything... Marazzi doesn't suspect a thing. I said I'd have a car waiting. - What car do you want? - A Giulia, if possible... Make sure the radio transmitter is well hidden, he isn't stupid. Yes, don't worry, and turn it on as soon as you get to the Hunchback's hiding place. - Sure thing, Commissioner. - Good luck, Epsosito. - You think it will work? - I'm almost certain this time. Let's hope your brother follows all your instructions. - He'll follow them. - You're drinking too much. - Marie, wine wakes me up. - Drink, drink. My mother raised me on this. I have to go, we have less than an hour. We've got to hurry, we have less than half an hour. One of those sons of bitches is coming. Come here. Watch that corridor. Let's go. Open it... Quick, open it! It won't open, I think the lock is broken. Hurry up! Hold on. Wait. Quiet, someone's coming! Sorry about that! But we need to hurry if you want that petrol. Go on, jump! You see? My uncle kept his word. God can deal with my friends, your uncle can deal with my enemies! That's a good one! You drive pretty well for the president of a petrol company. - They usually have a driver. - You haven't told me where we're going? Straight down the Tiburtina, you can't go wrong... When we get to Ponte Mammolo I'll tell you where to go. God damn it! That's all we need. Your license, please. I knew he was a cop the moment I met him. Your badge, I stole it earlier. What are you going to do to me? Don't ask so many questions. The Marazzi's can do what the fuck they like. You're great, Vince! You've got it all worked out. You know that piece of paper the Fox gave me? It was all torn up, I couldn't remember if it was Ponte Mammalo or Ponte Milvio. You did great but now you have to lay low for a while... Because I have things to do. Get in, I'll take you home. Pardon? Agent Esposito? Okay, I'll tell him immediately. Find Commissioner Sarti, I think he's down in the bar... Tell him it's urgent. Agent Esposito just called... He says he knows where the Hunchback is hiding... He's ten kilometres along the Tiburtina. It's here, turn right. - Well? - We just got here... It's strange, there are no houses here. Are you sure this is the place? He said ten kilometres. Esposito isn't stupid. - Let me have a look around. - Let's see. Commissioner! It's Esposito. Don't just stand there, do something. - Come on, someone give him a hand. - Tell them to call an ambulance. Ambulance? We need a garbage truck! Wait here. and don't move. - Can I help you? - No... - I'd like to go in. - Sorry, it's a private club, clients only... What's going on? I'm the manager. Nothing, for now, but you see them... What happens if you let us in? Please, follow me. Keep an eye outside, I don't want any trouble tonight. And cut all the phone lines. That table is free, you can sit there. I don't like it, I want that one. Don't worry, Vince, it's okay with me. Marie! Let me do this. - I don't like that table, I like that one. - That table is reserved. It's reserved! And who reserved it? Lawyer Agnolazzi, the one with a dick up his ass? No, lawyer Marcozzi. Marcozzi! Sure, I gave him a beating. Relax, I'm only joking. I just want to have fun tonight. A hundred notes... Now you'll let me have that table. We made it. Where are you going? Vince... Can I dance with Romolo? You can dance with anyone you fucking like... Why? Can't you dance with me? - I thought... - You thought wrong. - Because I'm a cripple? - No. I'll show you. - Can I dance or what? - You're great! Look at him! - That's quite a suit. - Medium sized with an extra hunchback. - Ask him if I can touch it? - What? The hunchback or his woman? Come on, dance! - Let's go. - Sit down if you don't want to dance. I will. Kill the music! I'm going to do a little show. Come on, sit down. Ladies and gentlemen... Good evening. I'm going to do a little show... You want to see it? By the way, of all the people here... I bet there are some real estate agents or property developers here. - Me! - Then make the most of this... Because there's a poor hunchback here who's looking for a an attic apartment. You like that? Let tell you a joke, my brother told me this one... He's great, my brother, but I didn't bring here because he stinks. He's great at telling jokes, but I'm going to try... Once upon a time there was a princess... I bet there's a princess or countess here tonight... Well this one needed a butler... One day, she takes on this poor guy, he's a hard worker... He really wants to please her... But he has a defect; he can't stop swearing... He didn't speak like you do... So he starts work, and one day a countess calls the princess... He picks up the phone and says, "Yeah?" And the countess says; "Excuse me, is the princess home?" And he replies; "She taking a shit." The countess isn't happy so she calls the princess later... And she tells her to find a butler with some manners. A few days later... The countess calls again... He says; "Yeah?" And she says; "Excuse me, is the princess home?" And he replies; "She's in the bathroom." "The bathroom!", that's great thinks the countess, she must have spoken to him... "Will she be long?" "I don't know, I can still hear her farting." That's enough! Who let that trash in? Trash? Give me my piece. Okay, ladies and gentlemen... I forgot to introduce myself... My name's Marazzi, Vincenzo... Otherwise known as the Hunchback of Rome. Have you heard of me? That gentleman is right, we're trash... But there's something he doesn't know... They didn't want to let us in... And they didn't want to let us in because we're not good enough... To see what goes on in here. The biggest mistake for bums like us... No, we're not bums... Because we're sons of bitches, we're trash... We steal, we rob... And we even kill... So we can be like you, coming here flashing your money around... Your jewellery... But we're not to blame... It's you, setting a bad example. If you set a bad example, then it's your fault... And if it's your fault, you need to be eliminated, got it'? I could kill you... I just have to press this. But I don't want to, it's too easy. Too easy. I'll let you go... But first I want to show you that material things aren't important... So... Fox, Gigi, come on... Clean them out. Cash, jewellery, everything... Like that, good. Come on. One more thing... We were talking about shit earlier, I've had an idea... You'll like this... Go and buy two kilos of English salt. I've got all the time in the world... We have to wait for my lady to come back. And while we're waiting, my friends... Assisted by the waiters... We're going to tie up all the ladies and gentlemen here tonight. We'll use the ties and napkins, okay? I was just thinking... There's a song I like, it's by this great musician, Antonello Venditti... It's called 'Sora Rosa'... Near the end he says... "Only one thing is real..." "if you have hope..." "That maybe..." "One day..." "Whoever eats too much now..." "Will have to spit out the bones, that are sacred." That's what he says, but Marazzi Vincenzo, the Hunchback of Rome... Says... I'm going to make you shit those bones! I'm going to make you shit them! Scared? Scared... You gang of dirty thieves! 'Nightclub Robbery' '40 Guests Forced To Swallow Laxatives' I'm counting on you... I want that lunatic behind bars. The public is on your side, remember that. Do you want to make a statement? We've been waiting two hours. What did the District Attorney say? He said the Hunchback is no different to any other criminal... And that I shouldn't let myself be influenced by the press. - Not us. - People are fed up... - They should bring back the death penalty. - Sure, let's do that... Not just for the Hunchback, but for lunatic and drug addicts... For feminists and queers, that will solve all our problems, right? - Who are you looking for? - Do you know Vincenzo Marazzi? - We're trying to sleep. - We're respectable people... Go and arrest some crooks, we work for a living. - Who lives in that house? - I mind my own business! - Let's see some I.D. - What do you want? It's all in order. Hold on a minute... - That's my house! - Who's inside? - My son, that's who. - Have you seen a hunchback around here? How would I know? We get all sorts around here... I'd let you in but I can't. My little boy is sleeping... And all hell will break loose if he wakes up. Excuse me. Quiet, Vince, there are cops everywhere. Let's go. It's clear. Vince? Where are you? - Who is it? - It's me, open up. - What do you want? - Your friend left an hour ago... He said to look in the toilet, there's a message for you. Thanks. Go, go... - Yes, I answered everything. - What the test easy? - Yes, it wasn't so difficult. - If you do well this year... There's a gun pointed at your daughter, one wrong move and I'll shoot her. Walk towards the Mini. - Yes, but please don't hurt her. - Throw your coat and bag inside... If you try anything... Move it. You dirty punk! I know your kind! That's my wife and daughter. Let go of me! The charge: attempted robbery and possession of an unlicensed firearm... Give me a light, Valenzi. - Where were we? - Name: Calogero Ciacci... Born in Rome in 1956, Address; Via dei Platoni, 25... Hold on... - What did you say your name was? - Calogero Ciacci. Are you related to Carmine Ciacci who owns a wine cellar in Tufello? Well? He's my uncle. Is Carmine coming or not? He knows I can't live without my cigarettes! And I can't live without tail, but Carmine isn't bringing any of that! If that's all you want, I've got some right here! Are you crazy? For fucks sake, Gigi! Let me hear the news. If that kid was telling the truth Ciacci knows where the Hunchback is hiding. He's going to pay for what he's done. - Sarti calling Monza-2. - This is Monza-2, go ahead. We're following Ciacci's Mercedes, I'll keep you updated. Commissioner Sarti calling Monza-3... The Mercedes, license plate M88-295 has just taken the exit for Viano. It's your turn to follow him. Okay, Commissioner. Let's go. The car is passing us now. Awaiting instructions. This is Sarti, hold your positions until Monza-3 gives us the location. - Who is it? - It's Carmine. Hi, Vince. - Give me a pack. - Yes... It's chaos out there. You're in all the papers. - The passports? - They'll be ready tomorrow night. The police! The bombs, I've got four left... Throw them one at a time, I'll come up behind them. Come out with your hands up! Take cover! - They're getting closer! - What the hell is the Hunchback waiting for? Hands up! Hands behind your head and face the wall! Where's the Hunchback? He broke the radio. And the others! Come in headquarters, this is Commissioner Sarti... The Hunchback shot and killed resisting arrest in Torvaianica... Send an ambulance immediately. Remove all roadblocks. I repeat, this is Commissioner Sarti... Guys, the Hunchback is dead. "Calling all cars: The Hunchback is dead. Your orders are to remove all roadblocks." Okay, over and out. Come on, guys, we're returning to base. I'm Commissioner Sarti. Down there, hurry! Let's go! "The shoot-out took place in the area of Torvaianica..." "What? No, Commissioner Sarti isn't wounded." "We repeat: Remove all roadblocks on the highways." What happened? Someone in a a blue Giulia, they swerved and went over the side. He just overtook me... And they say hunchback's bring good luck! "...and that closes our musical program..." "Now for the news headlines..." Over here. I've been looking everywhere for you... Your brother has left, he left a message saying to give you this. "Dear asshole, I have to go away for a while..." "Take this money and do something good with it..." "Open a shop or something..." "I want to tell you something I've never told you before..." "It's from the heart..." "I know yours is bigger than mine..." "All the shit I've been through, mine never had the chance to grow..." "Yes, it's so small now there's only room for you." "A big hug from your big bad brother." What did he write? He says... ...he's busy. That he'll be back soon. Does he say anything about me? He's says there's only room for you in his heart. Monezza... What do you think? Will he come back? Marie, as they say in Naples: 'Who can kill him?' He's got nine lives, like a cat.
