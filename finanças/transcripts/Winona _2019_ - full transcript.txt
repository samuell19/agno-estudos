You ask me If she will come To the shore And if she found it on the map He hasn’t left the house for 5,000 mornings. From that Thursday, when the piano got out of tune. He screamed so loudly. His rage echoed on the rocks, frightened the lobsters, the crabs and the shrimp. Red little road Red little road The children went this way To find an ice cream cone Come on. Imagine leaving a burn mark on a small fish. -What would be the fish’s name? -Marika. Flatheads, small bream, various shellfish and molluscs. Once, we found a trapped moray eel. We named it Daisy. If we were a film, what kind of film would we be? We would be a Spielberg film. Shot in the 80s in suburban Los Angeles. We are all sixteen. We are on our bikes exploring the old aqueduct. Inside is the lost treasure of One-Eyed Willie. This summer has also passed I’ve made love on this beach. All the girls on the island have been fucked on this beach. Yes, but I made love. With Argyris. He gave me two joints to soothe me and whistled the Wind of Change. What a song!!!! Our film would be called They All Play Piano Really Well. We would play sexy spies who have betrayed the U.S. government and are living in self-exile in Mexico. At nights, we would frequent some decadent beach bar drinking cheap tequila, eating chimichangas and playing Madonna songs on the out-of-tune piano. What time do we have to catch the ferry? When the sun sets. These new houses are so ugly. Have you noticed that car has been following us since morning? Remember the story about the guy who became manic during the summer holidays? If he overheard conversations at work about vacations, he would go crazy. We would be... Foxes by Adrian Lynn with Jodie Foster. It’s pronounced "Lyne". Adrian Lyne. Spit on the geek! Animals. What are you working on? The house on the hill. We’re trying to imagine what it’s like inside. Here is the lounge, with a screen for home cinema. The kitchen is inside. This is the sound studio, and this is the dark room. Leave her, and let’s go away together Don’t pretend you don’t remember me I’m the one who lights the fires Aman, aman You don’t want a woman Aman, aman I walk on the streets, so dazed I’ll enter the first bar and get smashed This night will be destruction I’ll enter the first bar and get smashed Come on boys, shower me with flowers Come on boys, let’s spend a fortune Let’s spend it all Come on boys, clap some more Open the bottles, let’s spend a fortune All of it Again! Come on boys, shower me with flowers Come on boys, let’s spend a fortune All of it Come on boys, clap some more Open the bottles, let’s spend a fortune All of it Applause. All of it Just think, there may be someone at the window watching us. What did you say? I said, just think, there may be someone at the window watching us. If someone who doesn’t know us sees us like this from afar... who will he think we are? He’ll think the truth. What is the truth? We are Russian women from St. Petersburg. We have come to this beautiful Mediterranean beach to do a photo shoot for Russian Playboy. And where is the photographer? He’s in the car. Loading the cameras with film. I’m the photographer, and you are my bunnies. Remember the nights we went out exploring in the forest? And to communicate, so we wouldn’t get caught, we used Morse code with the camera flash. Two fast flashes. Pause. Three fast flashes. Pause. Four flashes. And we were sure the coast was clear. I will not be afraid Of the colours you loved I will not be afraid to remember Hey, I also want hugs and cuddles. Once I broke up with a boy because he smelled of souvlaki. Take a deep breath. See, it doesn’t hurt. -It hurts. -What hurts? Not there. You’re going to shave my clitoris. One hundred. Fifty. Fifty One. Fifty Two. Fifty Three. Bury me alive. Every man withers like a flower, evaporates and dissolves like a dream. Rest in peace. I’m hungry. Give me some. Quickly. Give me some. Eat... Eat... I want some asparagus, too. Asparagus. Now, woman. I’ll put the meat in the saucepan. The beers in the freezer so they’re chilled. She doesn’t like it when they’re not really cold. She sulks and then she doesn’t caress me in bed. -Let me out. I want to go pee. -No chance. Oh come, on let me out. I want to pee. -No chance. -I’m going to piss myself, let me out! I’m coming. Catch. From the beginning. It’s full of piss. No, no. Calm down. It got wet. Are you ok? How are your boys? I dreamt the little monsters were making such a racket that I couldn’t stand it, and I killed them. And in my dream I did it in a very violent way. The eldest, I burned his face with the iron. The second, I took his hands and stuck them in a socket and electrocuted him. The middle one I pierced with a corkscrew. The silly one, I stabbed him with his toothbrush while I was brushing his teeth. I will not be afraid Of the colours you loved I will not be afraid to remember One, two, three tag without glasses. You ask me If she will come To the shore And if she found it on the map I sent you Signals Three times But I have no sign You sent me Selected post cards With love hearts on the edge I gathered The moments In a box To hide in the sand You laughed loudly You’re trying To wake up the star I blew Hard Like a child To destroy the castle I believe he thinks we are the same person. Who? The person watching us from the window of the house. He is a boy who has never left his bedroom. The boy believes he is seeing one woman during four different periods of her life. And the people in the car? They are our older selves. Extremely tired to come out of the car. When you’re 23, you’re Joanna. At 27, you’re called Jo. At 32, you’re called Ioanna, which is your real name. At 35 plus... you’ve taken your husband’s name. When your friends think of inviting you to dinner, they say "Ah! Let's invite the..." I went on a date with a guy. He suggested we go to dinner. I said "Let’s catch the new Woody Allen film." -You’ve seen it? -Yes, with this guy. -We went to Embassy Cinemas. -How was the film? Well... for me, it was possibly his best film since Match Point. Match Point is a copy of Crimes and Misdemeanors. He hasn’t made a good film since Husbands and Wives. Zelig was much better than Husbands and Wives. I prefer his comedies. Mel Brooks has made much better comedies. I believe that if I ever met him, I would be really disappointed. On the other hand, I think when he dies... You venomous witch... Knock on wood. As I was saying... when he dies... I think I’ll cry for days. -We won’t let him die. -We four? Yes. We four will never let Woody Allen die. We’ll be there when Death comes, dressed in Death Resistant suits and we won’t let him take him away. Well... we get to the cinema and I’ve come straight from work, and haven’t eaten a thing. The guy says... Do you want to put something in your mouth? So the guys says... Do you want me to get you something from the bar? And while I usually get a big popcorn and a coke, I felt like nachos with cheddar. It had been years since I had eaten nachos. I remember one time I couldn’t stop farting. Are you going to say something disgusting again? I don’t want to hear it. By the time the film started, I had eaten them all. So ten minutes later, the farting started. I let the first one go slowly, I sniff and realise it doesn’t stink, so I let the others rip. The so-called sneaky ones. So, after a while, I feel my bum burning. I think about going to the toilet, but I’m embarrassed because the theatre is full and I don’t want to miss a minute of the film. As I said, it was Woody Allen’s best film since Match Point. Not again with Match Point. Even Midnight in Paris was better. Much better. Midnight in Paris was nothing. How can you say it’s better than Match Point? So... at some point, I feel a huge fart coming and I think... I have to wait for the music, because I’m really not sure if it’s going to be a quiet one. A minute later, a jazz piece begins, and I think... now! And as I let it go, I realise it’s not a fart. -No! -It’s a shart. If it’s not a fart, what is it? Shart. Sartre? No, not Sartre. Not the French philosopher Sartre. "Shart". From "shit" and "fart". It’s when you want to fart, but by mistake, you shit yourself. What do you say we play the Woody Allen game? Ready? English titles. I will not be afraid Of the colours you loved I will not be afraid to remember -What did they say? -They were sleeping. I told them they should get out, stretch their legs. Dip their legs in the water. They didn’t want to. They said we shouldn’t worry. That they’re fine. Nails, nails, scrape my back And black smoke rises Why? Why? Inside of me there are dreams And a red light On Sundays I no longer listen to the match On the radio On Sundays I no longer listen to the match On the radio Dinosaurs tell me Enough, we are returning The goats eat the grass. We eat the goats. And we are eaten by God. Nails, nails, scrape my back And black smoke rises Why? Why? Inside of me there are dreams And a red light On Sundays I no longer listen to the match On the radio On Sundays I no longer listen to the match On the radio Dinosaurs tell me Enough, we are returning The goats eat the grass We eat the goats And we are eaten by God A man doesn’t live in the house. A woman does. She is a scientist and she is from Finland. Her name is Heenrika. She has bought this house because her oncologist told her it would do her good to swim, but not during summer, because the sun is too harsh for her skin. That window is her lounge room. She has been standing there watching us. And who are we? We are the women we are. You are Meryl. The eldest is Giulietta. The youngest is Jennifer Jason, and I am Eiko. We are named after famous actresses. We are the first batch of clones. Scientific experiments. Our father owned the legendary tavern Silence of the Lambs. He was known for his steaks and love of cinema. All the art world frequented the tavern, and everyone called him by his first name: Manolis. One day he got tired of butchering animals, and he sold the tavern. He never ate meat again. He would sit all day learning Russian. At some point he started writing novels using the pseudonym Nikolai Kostin. But no publisher expressed interest in his books. Thankfully our mother continued to be a CIA agent, and we had money to live and continue our studies. Today, clones are illegal. The police... Today, clones are illegal. The Blade Runner police are tracking them down. And we have come here to find human ID cards. But it’s hard, because we have these... Glasses. And these betray us. Because myopia has been cured. But even though myopia has been cured, and no-one wore glasses anymore, suddenly the first batch of clones began to present problems with their sight. And all the optical factories had closed. And we were forced to look for glasses on the black market. Glasses that belonged to people of the past. And who are the people in the car? Secret agents. They’re always behind us. They’re waiting for us to lead them to headquarters. And how do we each know that each of us are not clones? Couldn’t we be secret agents who wear glasses but don’t have myopia? I have memorised... I have memorised your personal files, and I know a mark that distinguishes each one of you. What mark? You, Jennifer Jason, were christened by the diva of independent cinema Jennifer Jason Leigh. You don’t remember, but she was so drunk from ouzo, so when the priest was doing the ceremony, she was clutching you so hard by the arm that you broke out in a cluster of ten moles. Giulietta, your godmother was Giulietta Masina. She always ate lamb chops and greens, and she first noticed your big toe on your foot. She told me it was big and rectangular like the screen of her favourite cinema in Rome. And me? You, Meryl, were playing tag in the garden with Meryl Streep, and at one point, she tripped you. You fell and broke your front tooth. And you, Eiko, were named after Eiko Matsuda of In The Realm of the Senses. What is your mark? Is the Finnish scientist listening to music now? She has the radio on. There is a tribute to a nun from Ethiopiia... Ethiopia... She has the radio on and today they are doing a tribute to a nun from Ethiopia. A pianist. Emahoy Guebrou. Yes. What a perfect day. What a perfect day. Emahoy. Is Heenrika watching us now? She’s never seen clones up close. Is she afraid of something? She’s afraid that maybe she’s like us. She’s sure she’s like us. So she’s afraid. She can’t see clearly, but she doesn’t let people know. Do you think she has... myopia? It’s titled "May". Will you help me with the support vocals? I don’t want to breathe I don’t want to breathe Me, that’s what I want I don’t want to not hurt I’m afraid that I won’t hurt Me That’s who I am I don’t want to be here I don’t know how to tell the truth I’m afraid to tell the truth Me That’s who I am I can’t sing the songs well I sleep softly on the flowers Here I’m afraid here too And I don’t want to be here One more time. I don’t want to be here I will not be afraid Of the colours you loved I will not be afraid to remember A happy couple live in the house. They moved here from Athens. They wanted to change their lives. He is trying to get a loan. He wants to open up a tavern on the waves and call it A Parallax View. He will only serve meals cooked a day before. He believes meals cooked a day before are tastier. She wants to have a baby and raise it here so the child can learn to love flowers, to respect animals. They want the baby to be a girl. And when it grows up, they want her, above all, to be happy, and then she can be whatever she wants to be. They go to bed at the same time every night. He brings in the laptop and they watch American TV series while eating chips with yoghurt and chocolate cigars. They wake up at the same time each morning. They sit in bed for half an hour, caressing each other. Sometimes it leads to wild sex. Other times, not. Today they’re not at home. Their jeep is gone from the driveway. They have returned to Athens to visit the gynaecologist. He will tell them the sex of the baby. The baby will be a girl. They will easily agree on a name for the girl and on the colour of her room. The girl will have myopia from a very young age. She will be blonde, but after a few years, her hair will darken. This little girl who will grow up in this house one day will change the world. Who are we? You are Giulietta. You have -8 myopia in the left eye and -7.5 in the right. You have five boys, and every night you think of suffocating your husband with the pillow. And yet, you love him dearly. You are a night club singer. A few years ago, you had a hit with the song "Leave Her, And Let’s Go Away Together’". And me? You are Jennifer Jason. You have -5 myopia in the left eye and -5 in the right. You are studying to be a cinematographer. You prefer girls with shaved heads who don’t know what they want in their lives. I’m sure you are the best at eating pussy. Your tongue never stops babbling. Who am I? You are Eiko. You have -13 myopia in the left eye and -12.5 in the right. If you lived in Ancient Greece, you would be considered blind. You believe you are the best jazz drummer in the world. You tell us you like girls, but you have never once introduced us to one of your girlfriends. Maybe you don’t want us to see you happy. I am Meryl, but I haven’t won 3 Oscars. I have -8.25 myopia in the left eye and -8 in the right. I write novels. I start something autobiographical, but in the process, I stray. I write horror novels, very violent and scary. My few friends wonder where these stories come from. "From my hands," I tell them. We have come from our sister’s funeral. Our youngest sister. Sixteen years old. She liked holding her breath under water. She could’ve been a diver or a dolphin. No. She too would’ve become an artist. A dancer, perhaps. She loved this beach very much. I look at us now and I’m thinking... we are the versions of her that survived. She could’ve become one of us. She didn’t want to. There are flowers that want to be cut. We were not there for her. She saw me dressing, and she asked me where I was going. I said I was going to a concert. I didn’t want her to come. I was avoiding her. She said, I don’t want to stay home alone with Mum asking 500 times, "Winona, are you ok? Shall I make you something to eat?" She couldn’t cope with it, my sweetie. The sweetest one. The little deer. The little deer. I came home from the concert. Mum and Dad were asleep in front of the TV. And I could hear Madonna’s "True Blue" coming from the bathroom. Her favourite song. It was me who pulled her into my room and put on the hairdryer. I started blowing hot air on her. I told Mum, "Don’t let Dad come in". And there was hot air blowing everywhere. And Dad was banging on the door. If we were a film, would we have a happy or a sad ending? A happy ending. If we were an American film, Madonna’s "True Blue" would be playing as the end credits rolled. In our film, we wouldn’t have the money to pay for the rights. So we would sing it without sound.
