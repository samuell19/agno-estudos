Ripped, corrected & synched by Fingersmaster. Enjoy! God and Saint Andrew! God and Saint Andrew! It was the year 1745 when the word spread over Scotland: Bonnie Prince Charlie, the Stuart heir, has landed on the shores of his homeland. Let all the clans rally to his side. God and Saint Andrew! A call to arms... the call to expel from the throne of England... the unwelcome monarch who ruled them: King George of the House of Hanover. God and Saint Andrew! The call to all Scotsman to restore to that throne... the exiled House of Stuart. The call that interrupted a prominent landowner's social visit... on a well-known lady of the village. What do you mean by this? Don't dare lay hands on the King's messenger. Mind your manners, highlander. You're in Ballantrae. Which king do you speak of! There was the answer: A ribboned emblem, now worn openly... by the Stuart followers. The white cockade. - A man can be hanged for wearing that. -There's worse than hanging. The king sitting on the English throne has no right to be there. There's a rightful king, a Stuart, spending his days in exile. There's a son of that king ready to fight for the throne. Bonnie Prince Charlie's in Scotland. He's here on the soil that belongs to the Stuart... and he's calling for loyal men. - He's calling for rebels. -Where is he now? Arisaig. And already with him are Lochiel with his Camerons... the Stewarts of Apin, the MacDonalds, Glencoe, Glengarry, Clanranald. But not this village. Fight the devil and leave the men to their work. If I've a mind to fight him, Jessie Brown, I'll know where to find him. I'm as good a Scot as anyone, but I recall the last rebellion. Ballantrae was in the last one. And the master may remember it took us 30 years to recover. This time England is beset by France. This time we'll win. That may be, but the dead won't care. Here's to the living who do. I'll see you in Arisaig. "An ill man to cross, " the villagers said... when they spoke of the Master of Ballantrae. A proud heir to a noble castle... and heir to its debts as well. What's afoot, Jamie? Come and find out. I've business with you, Henry. Business? Your brother's notions of business extend no further than... the cottage of Jessie Brown. You're an envious old man. There's a season for sowing oats and a time to plough them under. - I'll tell him. He'll be impressed. -What if Lady Alison learns of it? As if she didn't know. But, Father, you carried a sword in the last war. This is the same cause, the same king. - I was 30 years younger. -Exactly. Now let your sons go. - I want grandsons. -Jamie. Our ride. I waited for you. I ran into a messenger... wearing a white cockade in his hat. Messenger? A long message he must've had to have taken the whole... A white cockade? - Prince Charlie's in Scotland. -Alison. Which would you rather see on the throne: a Stuart or the man that's there today? A Stuart! I've been a poor guardian. My dear, never side with rebels. It seems to come naturally to me, sir. In that case, you won't mind if this rebel of yours... goes off fighting with the Stuart rebels? No. - They're calling out the clans, is that it? -They're not calling the man I'll marry. Jamie, if we fight, I'm with you. We'll fight if he has anything to do with it. Life's too quiet here. It isn't exciting enough. There must be flying banners, clashing swords. Blood on the ground before breakfast. You're going, aren't you? You won't be happy till you've torn us apart completely. Godspeed you then. I'll not stand in your way. That's going to make a devil of a wife. Your father had a devil of a son. Your father has two sons... and it wouldn't be the first time... that brothers have fought for different kings. Now, since we know that only one side can win... and no man can predict which side it'll be... You sly old fox. ...one goes with Prince Charlie... the other remains behind and is loyal to George. That's cheating at cards. Henry, there's a war and we can't prevent it... but we can protect our title and estates. - I ride with the Stuarts. -Where does that leave me? Here, safe at home, with your farming and horse doctoring. Mackellar, you're a genius. If the Stuarts win, the Master of Ballantrae wins with them. Then I forgive you for being on the wrong side. If they lose, why then, everything belongs to you. What more do you want? - Some kind of dignity. -But you'll have it. You'll be the new master. Why Henry, for a second son, this is a golden opportunity. - You don't have to outlive me. - I'll have no part of it. They'll be using swords, Henry, not quill pens. - Not bottle corks and gaming dice, either. -Henry, Jamie. Argument never settled anything, especially between us. Mackellar, give me a coin. That's a reckless way to decide the future of a title and estate. - It's the way to live. -I forbid this. Heads. McConnachie's grandson is with you. Two Murrays, a Blacksmith, Whitfield and his crew of smugglers. Free traders. Whitfield and his free traders. That's about the lot. They'll be assembled for you in the village. I'd recommend you leave Jessie Brown's brother at home. I'd recommend you mind your own business. There'll be no one to provide for her if he goes, or don't you care? Henry, always so good and pious. Scratch him out. Is there anything else I can help you with? Yes. Would you object, would you, if I asked you to take care of Alison? - Anything else? -Start by giving her my farewells. It might interest you to know she wouldn't see me. Stay a while, brother mine. This could be the last time we ever see each other. - It's bad luck to say that. -Bad luck? Not for you. Henry Durie, Lord of Ballantrae and Durrisdeer. It's not the way I'd like to come by the title. What other way is there? To make you happy, I've got to die. - Make me happy? -Wouldn't it? Come now, Henry. How many times have you wished me gone? Mackellar says that when you were a baby... a devil stole you away and took your place. Henry, I believe that. I was too late. Someone must've come before me. The stitching isn't very good. Not nearly as good as mine. A man doesn't notice such things, Alison. Somebody just handed it to me. And you took it. A very natural thing for a man to do. Alison, I've got something for you, too. And it's my heart, black as it is. But all of it. When I come back, I'll give you all this: The Highlands, the Lowlands, the rocks on the shore... the heather in the hills, and no more blackness in the heart. Jamie, can people die of being afraid? I'll die if you don't come back. Down from the mountains, up from the glens... came the great clans of Scotland: The Camerons and the MacDonalds... the Stewarts and the Duries. All marching to the meeting place at Glenfinnan... to pledge themselves to Prince Charlie. I call on you all to assist me in the recovery... of my father's just rights... and your own liberties! Glory from the start. Edinburgh: the triumphant march on the capital... that returned it at last to Scottish hands. Victory to the south, and the march for the invasion of England. Then came the setbacks. Lines that were overextended couldn't support the invasion... and there was a sudden retreat from Derby. But nothing could dim their bright hopes for ultimate victory... as they fell back and formed ranks for the epic battle of Culloden. It became an epic defeat. The cause of the Stuarts... went up in smoke, to vanish forever from history... and the redcoats of King George policed the land... hunting down the beaten remnants... no longer patriots, but rebels. It's a bit crowded in here for two. You'll find you can go out by the same door you came in. I find it a little crowded myself. Your speech is about as Irish as your manners. I'm sure I can learn nothing about manners from a Scot. To think I was lured to this uninhabitable land... to risk me life with amateurs. You were at Culloden. You have the honour to address Colonel Francis Burke... gentleman of Dublin, chevalier of France... and a hunted refugee of a devastated ragtag army. Also a talkative fool. You'd be kicking at the end of a rope... if you told that to the wrong kind of ear. I could see by the look of defeat about you... that you were one of the amateurs. Now, be off with you while I still have stomach to eat. If you got any of these screeching bagpipes about, please, don't play them where I can hear. Let me acquaint you with something, sir. I'm an ill man to cross. I'm not the most patient. I'm as little patient as yourself, I care not who knows it. You've finally said that to the wrong man. Put that down! I may want it with the rest of your bird. Now, one of two things, Irishman: Either we fight on the spot or we be comrades. Which is it to be? Cut each other's throats or be friends for life either way, is it? - It makes no difference to me. -And how do we make the decision? Heads, we fight. Tails. Good. I'm a wee bit tired at the moment. You'll find this joint very tasty. All over the defeated land, in every village square... the terms and conditions of surrender were clearly proclaimed by the English. God save the King. You will take note that the penalty of death... is herein specifically described. Every person found guilty of aiding the rebellion... shall be hanged, drawn, and quartered. You will also note that whoever shall shelter... or in any way comfort such a rebel... shall be considered equally guilty and suffer an equal punishment. On the other hand, those who inform against those rebels... or against those who harbour those rebels... shall be amply rewarded in money. Not a sound, if you don't want a dirk in your ribs. A villager over there called you by name. I'll hear it again from you. - Mackellar. -Durie. Henry Durie. Well, faith! You're the very two people I wanted to meet. Let's have a look at your faces. Is this how you usually meet people? It cuts out the lengthy formalities. Why, I'd be dead. You're both of you handsome fellows. - There's no word of truth in that Jamie. -My brother? "Look for an ugly, slow-thinking young dog," says he. "Accompanied by a bumbling ancient, most likely wearing account books." -Is he alive? -What do you know that could kill Jamie? By the by, has the recent ill fortunes of war harmed your cellar? Where is he? He says, "If I'm seen at that house, they're all in trouble. "You sniff out my brother. Have him get a bottle of whiskey... -"and bring him directly here." -Bring me where? Didn't I tell you? Must be the dryness in my throat. He's at the cottage of Jessie Brown. - Go tell the house. -Especially Lady Alison. Tell her he's alive, but not where. She mustn't risk being caught. Your master's developed a peculiar taste for Irish whiskey. We lost forever this time. All those brave, bright banners... and our Bonnie Prince skulking in a cave, hiding like a stag in the heather. Stay here, Jamie. They'll never seek you here. - We can hide you at the castle. -They'll seek everywhere. There's a boat in the bay. It'll take us to France. How much money can you bring me? I don't know. I'll have to see what there is in the strongbox. Father might have some, but you know how it's been. No, I don't. I didn't know you'd have to count the till to save my life! - That's not what I meant. -"I don't know, Jamie." Give me a man of decision like your brother who says: "You want gold? I'll bring you gold from the bottom of the sea... "and here's the shirt from my back and my hand." You're a cautious countryman. Will you wait till your brother's hanged? We need money! It's blood for our veins! It's air for the lungs of us! Watch your hands, you wild savage. - That's my brother. -You'll have whatever I can raise. Jessie, see who it is. - No. They'll take you away. -Go on! - Who's there? -Henry. Jamie, I'd have died if you hadn't come back. I must go away again. No, you mustn't. Come home, Jamie. - We'll hide you. -No. It's where you belong, Jamie. We'd be together. - They'd never rest till they found me. -Then take me with you. Don't you see that's impossible? Nothing will ever stop me coming back to you. Nothing. And we'll be in that house together, and it'll be the house it used to be: strong and proud, indebted to no one on earth. You must go now, my love. You mustn't be found here. Jamie, isn't there any way that... Henry will come down to the beach tonight, bringing money. You come with him. You hear that, Henry? I'm to bring her along. Yes. We've got to be leaving before morning. Don't approach without a signal. Bring a dark lantern. - I'll flash it twice. -Twice it is. You'd best take Alison back now. Be careful. Jessie will see if it's clear. Where is she? Jessie. Where can the man be? Counting his coins over and over again? He's waiting for your woman to fix her hair. You shouldn't have invited her. She'll be here at least. Aye, later in the morning after the smugglers have left without us. My respects to your darling brother. Don't forget the money. There they are. You'll hardly have time for a kiss. Tell her you'll make up for it later. That's doing the trick. Only one coming, sir. The other must still be below. Signal the men on shore to close in. Fire! The redcoats. How could they know? Cast off. - Here's his hat, sir. -A White cockade. Good. That's the one we're looking for. He was shot on the cliffs and fell into the sea. Only this hat was found. My Lord, if it's possible to disregard treason... I offer my sincere regrets. You're the new master, my son. I can't say he cared much for these grounds, but it's where his remains ought to rest. The sea always gives up her dead, master Henry... and I wouldn't feel satisfied without looking. Get dressed. I'll have the horses ready for us. Jamie! More lives than a cat. But they shot you into the sea. The money I asked you for, did you bring it? I have it. I had it when the redcoats came. It's not very much, but it's all I could get. You almost saved even that. Come on. Let's tell the others. And when, brother mine, do we tell the English? Who gave the redcoats the signal? We were the only ones who knew it. You want to say Alison wanted me trapped? Or that Burke wanted himself killed? My own brother. My own. There was a chance I wouldn't come back. You won that on the toss of a coin. But that wasn't good enough. You wanted to be sure I was dead. They came to the house, put us under arrest. What a liar you are! What a coward, what a sneaking thief. Everything you wanted to take: the title, the estates. And you even wanted Alison, didn't you? Didn't you? Yes! Yes, I wanted her. You had everything else you didn't deserve. It's the devil's own work you had her, too. My own brother. I like that no more than you. I've shuddered at times at the thought of it... that any of your foulness might be in me. Why did you have to come back? Why couldn't they have killed you out there? I'll give you the chance to remedy that. I've had enough, Jamie. I did not tell the English. - Mackellar! -Master Henry! Mackellar, my brother's dead. - Aye. Are we ready to go? -I just killed him. My own brother, and I've killed him. What are you saying, laddie? He was out there waiting in the stables. Look. Look at my hand. I caught his blade. I found him. - Master Henry. -Hurry. Here he is. - I can't see a dead man, laddie. -But he was here, I tell you. He came back and I killed him. Wait. Look at this. Now do you believe me? And this is mine. Mackellar, do you think I dreamed this? He was lying here when I left him. There's blood on the ground, and there's this. He was dead. - Then the devil came and took him away. - He was dead! - He was shot and he fell into the sea. - What? Why should we kill him twice, Master Henry? To make Lady Alison suffer twice? To grieve your father more? We must always examine the matter of consequences. He died in the sea, Master Henry, before witnesses. He died in the sea. You're going to live, Jamie, because the luck of the Irish has touched you. Thinking you were at the bottom of the ocean, I go back... for the escape money... and there you were lying there, pouring your blood into the ground. The heathen, irreligious redcoats to wound a man... and leave him dying on the ground. - My brother. -Then you can speak. Bless you, Jamie. My brother! That's what I am, and that's what you are to me. Alison... I must go back. And someday you'll do it. Someday you can fritter away all your time. Right now, we've a smuggler to board. We'll have a salubrious cruise on the high seas, Jamie... and a glistening future in France. The vessel that dared help two fugitives of war... was well-suited for the task. She was a smuggler of contraband goods, human cargo included. And fully as lawless as this lawless ship... was her master... Captain MacCauley. Where's the passage money? How can you speak of such a vulgar thing... in the presence of a hero of Culloden... and a wounded one at that? Burke... Why, you dear boy, you had it all along. Not half enough. It's twice enough, even counting the king's ransom you asked. - How far do you think France is? -If it's France you're seeking, swim for it. We're bound for the West Indies. - Get under way, Mr. Bryce. -Aye, aye, sir. You swindling scum of a coward! You mouse-hearted imitation of a man! You green, crawling snake that slipped up from the slime... when your thieving mother wasn't looking! Three months on the bounding main, and you're your own smiling self again. - A lovely day, Mr. MacCauley. -I'm glad you've the time to enjoy it. Are you so? You're a generous man. Get on with your work! Would you want a touch of the rope's end? Sail, ho! - Where away? -Coming up on the larboard! Do you smell the tropics, Jamie? We'll be in sight of land by the morning. But it's not Scotland. Jamie, this is the place where gold pours into the hand... and honey in your mouth, and women that go to men... with blood and fire to take them. This is for us. I'm going back to Scotland, Burke. To get back to your Alison. Yes, and to my brother, too. If it's murder you've got in your heart, save some for that stench MacCauley. I have enough left over for him. - What do you make of her, Mr. Bryce? -I do not feel she's friendly. - She's cracking on more sail. -She appears anxious to overtake us. We'll keep clear of her. Don't spread any more canvas till after dark. - Then we'll go about and give her the slip. -Aye, aye, sir. There's someone out there, Mr. Bryce, and I think they can see us. - Give her another quarter turn down. -Aye, sir. All hands prepare to repel boarders! - You've one aboard already, Captain. -All hands on deck! Repel boarders! All hands on deck! Savage, barbaric pirates... with an incredible French dandy for their leader. This one, fighting his own captain. No! You're not fighting a windmill. Deftly! Keep the arm supple. Thrust! No, I will show you. - I'll show you. -I've waited too long for this. I cannot endure such crudeness. Look out, Jamie! Here's what I was explaining to that bungler. Although the cutlass isn't my weapon, badly balanced and utterly gripless. I much prefer the foil. But keep the arm supple at all times. It's one of the elementary laws. There is some very excellent brandy on that table. My quartermaster is amusing himself with the prisoners. He has a taste for it. We give every prisoner a choice. They may join us, or not. What do they feed them on in Scotland that makes them so obstinate? There was an Irishman on board, a man named Burke. Colonel Francis Burke, Irish gentleman. Very talkative. Is he still talking? That bothers you? Yes, it bothers me. - I would stop it if I could, but my men-- -You can stop it if you have a mind to. Please. It would be a great pity. Entrez. Jamie, lad. Is it you, awake and happy? Jamie, it is a beautiful slop chest of a ship we're on... for the likes of King Solomon, and no other. - The talkative Irishman. -It is only because I'm free from care. It was breaking the tender heart of me, Jamie... to think of your loving family with nothing but all that money to console them... while their favourite boy, the heir to a fabulous fortune... was walking a pirate plank. How does it go? Are you finished? Yes, all except these two. My quartermaster, Matthew Bull. - A gentleman. -And a fighter. - What a fighter. -Give him to me. No, you're extravagant. You'd throw away a fortune in ransom. I don't like his eyes. I don't trust him. That's strange, when I'm so fond of you. - Give him to me. -Imbecile! Get out, you destroy me! Set sail for Tortugas Bay! A good man, but an imbecile. And the others, beasts. What do they know of an Etruscan vase, a Ming porcelain, a Cellini candelabra? But you, monsieur Durie, you're accustomed to these things. No. Now lad, this is no place for a modest man. Nor for a liar. There's no money in my family. There's no money in the whole of Scotland. Now you've done it. What do you expect to do with that? It has a certain quality of persuasion. It could persuade only me. There's an entire crew out there, and Matthew Bull equal to half another. You won't care about the rest of the world. Bull gets the second bullet after you. That will leave the crew without a head. There's a possibility I can supply that. A possibility laced with hazard. Look, Captain... I intend to get back to Scotland with money in my pocket. If it must be done through piracy, then let it be so. If I must gamble in gaining your crew, I'll gamble. You disappoint me, monsieur. Why gamble at all? Why not seek a more comfortable arrangement? I'm all for comfort. What is it? A partnership with me. I have an objective, too. A certain château in Burgundy. Perhaps, together, we can share our separate dreams. - How many men did you lose boarding us? -Six. How much gold did you find? And nothing for me? Captain, you're not doing very well. - Perhaps, together, we will do better. -Perhaps. Put that down. Jamie, you're a wicked lad... and harm will come to my reputation for letting you lead me to piracy. lam very pleased that you'd take me as a partner, monsieur... though, it would have been entertaining otherwise. Land! Land on the starboard bow! Turn to, I tell you! We're running into Tortugas Bay! The partnership produced certain changes, especially for Matthew Bull. His order, for example, to spruce up the ship... didn't come from his pirate captain. It came from the Master of Ballantrae... who was accustomed to disregarding danger. It looks like the ship has a new captain. - It must appear so to him, too. -And you'll do nothing! He may prove useful. Tortugas Bay. A delightful sanctuary, monsieur. A safe harbour for buccaneers. That galleon... Somebody has been very fortunate. That's close enough, Frenchie. So it is my friend, Captain Mendoza, who has been so lucky! - I must come aboard. -Sheer off. I wish to speak with my friend, Captain Mendoza. Your friend, el Capitán, is ashore. Sheer off, or we'll sink you. To capture a Spanish galleon. Very good idea. Why not that one? Mendoza's? It needs a certain boldness, that's true. Which, of course, you will supply. Which we'll both supply. This is a joint enterprise, isn't it? This one's mine! He's mine! Darling, if only you weren't so shy. No. Faith, laddie, bedevil to the dear creature. If you don't want her give her to a man who does. Has anybody ever told you that you are a swine? You darling. You're not hurt at all. Mendoza: a legendary name in those waters. A bejewelled, overstuffed, red-bearded pirate with a record of much success... like the magnificent Spanish galleon anchored in the bay. And a rather select prize ashore. Come here. Felicidades, Frenchie. Where have you been? It's been a long time. Captain Mendoza, I'm so glad to see you. I hear that with you the hunting has been most excellent. They're all very glad to see me, like sharks in a school of herring. And Marianne is still the most beautiful shark in the Caribbean, no? Did you think I'd be waiting for you? What did you bring me? Well, I have not captured a Spanish galleon. He has. Loaded to the scuppers. You and your promises. Frenchie. Look, isn't she a beauty? She is indeed. I do not know this one. I know nothing of you. Let's leave it that way. Monsieur James Durie, a most grand Scottish gentleman. You make a very good fist, señor. I like him. Mendoza el Magnífico gives a big party tonight, his last in port. He sails with the morning tide. You'll come, Frenchie? You, too. I like you. I slit the guzzle of anyone who does not drink with me. His last night. Not much time. But enough. His mind's on celebrating. The same goes for his crew. Except that they outnumber mine three to one. Would Mendoza himself hesitate to tackle such a job? I doubt it. "The greatest of the buccaneers," they say. So does Mendoza say, interminably. A rich prize. Bull! We'll need the crew. Assemble them. Bring them here. The greatest of the buccaneers without a ship. Charming thought, n'est-ce pas ? Burke, come on! Would you have me leave these poor, lonesome bits of depravity? I'm about to enrich the lives and experience of them. Come on. All right, you gloomy man, I'm coming. My friend, Captain Mendoza of the galleon out there, asks you to do him a service. For Captain, anything. Send three casks of your stoutest rum to the dutiful men of his deck watch. He wishes to reward their virtue. A man of great heart, el Capitán. One of these tablets, señor, and you'll sleep like a newborn babe. And two of them? They'll think you've departed from the world. Twenty or thirty more, if you please. I have some friends who are restless, too. - I have been waiting for you. -Me? I knew you would come. When my eyes invite, they always come. How can anyone resist you? I happen to be occupied with business. Business? What is business? I know only love. I thought you might be interested in a handful of jewels or some gold. Yes. I like also jewels and gold. Then see that el Capitán doesn't leave the tavern. I don't want him to go looking for his crew. When I dance, monsieur, men do not go looking for crews. - They have eyes only for me. -That I can well believe. - And after the party? -Unfortunately, that's impossible. My time here is so short. It's fully occupied. Perhaps I wish to sail with you. Mademoiselle, all I can say is, I couldn't think of a better shipmate. Adiós. - Thank you, señor. -It's done. We'll proceed to the tavern. And that is how the great Mendoza raids ships... single-handed! It is what you may call... a matter of genius. A bit overdone, but effective with small children and elderly ladies. What? El Magnífico! I'll forgive you. El Magnífico! The greatest buccaneer of all the world. Especially around the waist. Come! Let us have music! - I will dance for you? -No. It is late. You will come with me. El Capitán must go and find his crew. That beard of yours seems to be clogging up your ears. The lady said she'd dance. If Marianne is to dance, it is I who will say "dance." Dance. Look alive, lads! The streets are swept clean of Mendoza's boys. - We're ready to proceed to his galleon! -Galleon? Mendoza's galleon is the only galleon here. It's about to change hands, el Supreme. El Magnífico-- I've long wanted to barber this gargoyle. Marianne, our bargain. You are a gentleman, and you like Marianne. I can tell. Yes, I like Marianne, but I keep thinking of red hair. Hair as red as the dawn over a village called Ballantrae. Red, monsieur? Skin as cool as the breeze, and eyes as blue as your own. But you do not speak of Marianne. No, I speak of an image which is in my heart. All of you, down to the boats! - Burke, on your way. -Not again, Jamie. The dear helpless females want comforting. Where's your heart? See that Burke is left behind. Here comes the new watch. Now we go ashore. It appears the shipment of rum arrived. - Where's Burke? -A boat behind. He was slow. - They don't talk much. -Sing out, boys! Did you leave any girls for us? - They are gaffed, everyone. -Those aren't our boys! - Sheer off, or we'll sink you! -It's Frenchie. It's a raid! Bull. As soon as we're aboard, you get forward and crack the foresails. You give orders like a man who is born to lead. De prisa! You, over there, set sail! Reel in those boats! Up anchor! Here it is, lads! Here we are! We're rich as Croesus! - Some old witch will miss this one. -Please. I would thank you not to disturb my treasure. This time it is loaded, monsieur. - I see you are grateful for my help. -Boundlessly. I could scarcely have done it without you. It's unwise to take too many chances. I took the precaution of unloading that. No! Perhaps it's just as well. I never did have an opportunity to teach him fencing. - You have been studying my style. -I've my own style, thanks. Thanks for your help, my friend, and bon voyage. Jamie, lad, you lost your temper again. Jamie! We'll go home in a royal barge with mermaids pulling it by their teeth... and elephants to carry us to the lovely shore. All right, men, get aloft, and shake the wrinkles out of those sails. Get them up. Come on. I said get aloft! Get aloft! Get aloft! I'll give the course when we clear the harbour. Aye, aye, sir. Nor' nor' east for Scotland. Scotland and home. The first lap across water in a rich outlawed galleon... that had to be disposed of with care. Then the last lap by carriage across land. Halt! But a Scotland still policed by the English. Halt there! A land that still threatened capture and death for fugitives from the law. In the name of the King! Even rich fugitives with a fabulous chest of treasure at their feet. I'll see your papers. - You enter Scotland like you're chased. -Are we in it now? It's a bad-looking country. - Odd place to travel for pleasure. -Pleasure is where you find it, young man. This is Mr. Bally, a gentleman. 'Tis I who am the General Fitzbrien, you see there. And I'm as big a liar as the papers. Pleasure. All the lovely trimmings for it at our feet, and toting it to that gloomy village. Faster! How did a man of such little faith ever become a general? I told you we'd be out in a day, and we will. - Hamstrung thereafter to a skirt. -Only one of us. And suddenly minus a brother. The queer mixed heart of these barbarians... stupefied by love and unbalanced by hate, and the two working at once. How will you be doing it? Will you simply slip a blade across his deceitful throat... or will you throttle him with your own hands gradually... and feel the death coming to him? Just so long as he feels it. On to Ballantrae, to Durrisdeer Castle... that would still be in mourning for the master believed to be dead. Mourning? Not at Durrisdeer. That period had long since ended. There was gaiety for others that night... as the prodigal ghost's carriage rolled nearer. Dancing once again. - There's been dancing in Ballantrae. -In the kilt? If a man doesn't wear the kilt, I don't call it dancing. - We're all glad of the repeal of the ban. -An auspicious occasion to do it, my lord. They must have known you were coming, to greet you with laughter and music. Music? What a darling thing to fall into my arms. Have you heard of me? It's General Fitzbrien at your service. - Colonel Burke? -General Fitzbrien. Bless my soul, Master Jamie. Bless my soul. Don't worry about your soul. That'll be taken care of. Run, hide. Can't you see? The English are all about. You remember me, I hope, your Ladyship. Mr. Bally. - Jamie, you're alive. -Bally's the name. - You look as if you're seeing a ghost. -Where have you been? On the road back to you. You said you'd wait, and you have. Jamie, there's something you have to know. Ballantrae's changed. The party's for the English. - Not for the English. -I knew my brother... was on speaking terms with them, but not that he celebrated the fact. They're granting pardons. The fighting's over. What are they granting informers? I was sure you'd remember Mr. Bally. Yes. Meeting you again, my lord, is a great, great pleasure. No greater than mine. This officer seems to think he knows me. Major Clarendon, Mr. Bally. - Sir. -Sir. There was something familiar about you. You could almost pass as a member of this family. Really? That's strange. Personally I never noticed the slightest resemblance. - You've been away, Mr. Bally? -Quite some time. - Since the rebellion? -Since the war. - For pleasure, no doubt. -For my health, sir. You don't appear to be a man subject to illness. This illness came to me on the point of a knife. - That reminds me, we have business. -Whenever you like. - Now. -We must keep Mr. Bally for some time. There's much to talk about. I'm afraid, Mr. Bally doesn't care much for talk. He believes in action. That's a Scottish trait, isn't it, Mr. Bally? Yes. There have been some who wished it otherwise. King George, for instance. I know what you mean. And Lady Alison here. Now I don't know what you mean. The difficulty of persuading her to set the day for this betrothal. The sympathy of the whole garrison was with you. Don't let her make you wait too long for the wedding. This is the Durrisdeer ring... for betrothal. And this is the hand that waited for whoever would give her the ring. The righteous son, as it happened. The righteous, dutiful son. Dutiful only to himself! I'll tell you something about this host of yours! This thief, with no more courage than a pickpocket... lifting a blind man's purse... this coward, who never raised an arm for Scotland that bred him... was entrusted with his brother's safety, and then betrayed him... to these red-coated Hanoverian swine! It's a lie! It's all a lie! Then, when by a miracle, a brother escaped... this sorry blackguard fouled him in a duel... and left him on the ground to die... then laid claim to everything that was his brother's. Everything but one. Then he took even that. Henry, you've done your worst! You're going to die! - No, Jamie! -Jamie! How many of your lives must we take? Jamie, lad, that may be loaded. Jamie! Up those stairs, Jamie. I'll hold them back. Henry! Jamie, whatever made you... We did not come to put Scotland to the sword. We came bearing gifts of peace, for it has been proved our two countries... can live as one, and profit mutually, thereby. But always there are rebels. You men are guilty of aiding these rebels. The punishment for this crime is death. But it will not be demanded... for the friends of these rebels, or brother... you are their victims as well. Your loyalty to the crown has been well known. It has been corrupted only by the influence... and the existence of these men. We recognize that so long as they are alive, the rebellion is not over. James Durie and Francis Burke... hear the sentence of this court: It is our decision that you shall be confined to this house... until sunrise tomorrow morning. You will then be taken to a place of execution. There you will be hanged by the neck until you are dead. The guard will remove the prisoners. Come on. Double over, quickly! Steady there. Oh, my lady, help me. Help me, please. - Jessie, what is it? -I have to save him. I have to! To have him thinking it was his brother. To have him die thinking that, and not knowing the truth. - What're you saying? -It's true. That night by the beach, when the soldiers came... I sent them. You couldn't. He kissed you, my lady, right before me! And there was no grace in him doing that. That's why I sent them. I wanted to die ever since. I wanted somebody to kill me... in the same way as I saw him being killed. It would right no wrong, Jessie. How can I help him? What can I do? Anything! If there's anything you could tell me, I'd do it. If I knew what to tell you, I'd do it myself. Are the walls of this castle so thick? What of the two of us, my lady? Together. The two of us? With help. Maybe if... The walls are thick, Jessie, but at least they're Durrisdeer walls. "Colonel Francis Burke, Chevalier of France. "1701 to 17..." And I trusted her. Forget her and think of the bounties you've had. A brother you thought was an enemy, spilling his blood to save yours. But why? Why did he do it? I'll tell you, my friend... it makes no sense. Stop it, Jamie. Would you deny yourself even that fine image... since you've nothing else to take with you? There's almost a lift in the sky out there, and the minutes will be racing for it. Not much time to remember all the girls you've known... all the laughter you've heard, all the gold you've spent... and all the plans you had to spend more. The places we've not seen, Jamie. The things that lie about the world, the fun of it. Jamie, the guard says I may speak with you. I hardly think your betrothed would approve, or doesn't that matter to you? It would if I had a betrothed. I no longer have one. My condolences, your Ladyship. You seemed so bent on marrying a Durie. So I was, because loving you had bent me to it. When I thought you were gone, there was no other way I could be close to you. Because it was your family, I wanted it to be mine. Because he was your father, I wanted to please him. Because Henry was your brother, I could marry him. - You expect me to believe that? -No, you dull-witted-- You can't believe that I could love you... and still promise to marry Henry? No. Yet you loved me when you were with Jessie Brown. Straight through the gizzard. Now he'll stand and stare at her with that iron jaw of his, clenched like an ugly trap. And no light in his eyes, and no fire in his hands. Will he reach out and touch her, this Scot, with a rope ready to encircle his neck? To think the Scots are kin to the Irish. - And they are. -You'll have to go now, my lady. - There's something I want you to have. -You must pass nothing to the prisoners. Not even a family ring? Your father wanted you to have it, too... with the knowledge that the strength of the Duries from the first of the line... is embedded there. Come, my lady. He said it would comfort you, and lead your steps aright. Alison! Perhaps it is just as well, Jamie. You'd not have led a life that would make a woman happy. A Woman wants to be a nesting sort of a bird... with wings of no importance. You'd not care, laddie, to live without wings. "To lift up the eyes," unless my Latin professor was a lying fraud. "Lift up the eyes to heaven. That's the way to salvation." The motto on the Durie shield. It was my ancestor, the first Lord of Durrisdeer, who set it forth. He was imprisoned here about 300 years ago... battling for Robert II. And spent his time toying with dead languages. No. He found a way to escape. He was... "Lift up the eyes." - Of course, that's it! -You've finally cracked with the strain. We've got to get out of here. What could be simpler? The guard could have no objection to that. There must be a way. There has to be. Where do you think you're going? Lady Alison sent some food for the master. The master's got no stomach for any food. There's no time for it anyway. Get along with you. They haven't had a bite to eat all night. I said begone! Hurry, Jamie! The prisoners are escaping! Open this door! Open this door! Guard the gates! Jamie. The shield. Lift the eye, Jamie. - Jamie, there's no time. -We'll look after her, sir. They'll soon be in. Jamie, you have to-- Would you come this far and stop? Burke, you go. On the cliff that night... it was I who betrayed you. Forgive me, Jamie. - Come back someday. -Wait for me. They've taken the tunnel out. Cover the outer grounds. Follow me! Jamie. The rock, quick! Hire the horses. Henry. - Thanks, Henry. -That's all right, Jamie. This may end the line. There'll be trouble. Not after you've gone. You're the last rebel. Under the brambles by the stable you'll find a chest. Your creditors might be interested in it. Your creditors, Jamie, and your Alison. Hurry. I'm sure of it now, your whole line is pure-blooded Irish. Give her my love, Henry. Send her to me soon, and come along yourself. - I like it here. -It's all yours. I give it to you. You're not giving me anything. I won it, on the toss of a coin. Use the Smuggler's Cave. Remember. Remember? I showed it to you. Block the bridge! You're a fool if you come with me. I know. -- English --
