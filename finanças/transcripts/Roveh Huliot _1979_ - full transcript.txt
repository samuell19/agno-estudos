THE WOODEN GUN Introducing: Eric Rosen as Youni Schreiber Written and Directed by: Ilan Mossenzon Tel Aviv, april 1950 - Is that, where he'll be? - There. He'll come out of the school. Now we pound him Into meatloaf, puree him. - We've never hit a lone soldier before. - Well, we will now. You're just saying that because he's in your class. - Am not. It's against the rules. - There are no rules. We've got to win this, once and for all. Get it? This war's been going on for three months now. Danny, this is not the time to go for a piss? Get over here. Little wimp. Yoini doesn't deserve this, he's the best one out of them all. - Why should we pick on Youni? - Why? Because when his nut-job mother sees what we've done to him, she'll break up their gang by tomorrow morning. You dig? - He's still the best one out of them. - None of them are any good. He's our enemy, how could he be any good? Huh? - Voram, go see if he's coming. - Sure. You can trust me. Mickey, climb that tree. Danny, go hide behind the fountain. Anatoly, stay with me. Adi, he's coming! I'm alone. It's against the rules. You can't. Get him! Ow, my arm! - My arm! - sure, I broke your arm. Next time, it'll be your skull, get that? - We win! - Hey... - The war in this neighborhood is over. What are you doing here?! - Come on. - Go home! Go! Com on, Anatoly! Revenge, that's what I want. THey were all there when Adi broke my arm, But the cast only comes off tomorrow, isn't it a bit soon? I've waited a month, I'm not waiting any longer. If you didn't walk alone at night, away from crowds, I can walk where I want, when I want. It's a free country. Jackass! Mister Yonatan Schleive, at wich time you may beat your friends with both hands. You know something? I don't know who you are lately. - We're here! Students, we've arrived! - Yes! Check out htis heat, damn! Where's he dragged us to? - What is it? - Ammo! Those are the toughest cones around, we're sure to win. Why are we here, Noah? - Where to? - Nowhere... - Follow me! What is this? Where's he dragging us off to? Noah's filpped, no foolin'. Jerusalem. Jerusalem... Cherished for generations. Jerusalem, the eternal city. Thousands of generations have dreamt of thee, Jerusalem. There's nothing but mountains here, where's Jerusalem? "Blessed art thou, Lord..." "Who gave us life and brought us to this day." - Amen. - Yes Jerusalem. - We don't see any Jerusalem. What are you doing? What are you doing there? What's he looking for? - I'd love to have a chat! with your mother when we get back to shcool. What's this? Quit it... "It is neither a religious problem, nor a social one..." "It is neither a religious problem, nor... nor..." I just wanted four eggs, and he wouldn't give them to me. I should've gotten next week's rations! "Got complaints?" "Address them to Dov Yossef. Austerity is austerity" The baby's ill, why should she suffer, over this jerk? Why should Anatoly suffer? Why should your Youni suffer, Mari Of all places, he had to take them to Jerusalem. I can't fathom it. Just look at the time! - I'm fed up, Maia, I'm all out of patience. "When first came here, there was nothing but sand" "and jackals." Miraculous. All I want is a decent life, that's all I want. I've suffered enough. I don't know what I'm looking for this country. Have you got a choice Henja? - I might. _ Children, get ready, we're starting. Quickly. Quickly! We won't make it, hurry up. What is this? Dor, Dor, we're starting. "The defendant's strength..." - What? What? Defenders. "The defenders' strength availed them no longer," "and on that day, the Romans breached the temple defenses," "and set it.. - Aflame." - "And set it aflame." "At the sight of the fire engulfing the hallowed place," "the people's spirits fell." Well, get on with it. "And the Romans did deal them a forceful blow,' and blood ran like water over the streets of jerusalem." Children, get up, get up. Run about, run about... Faster. Run about. Yes. Like that. Yes. Turn about! Forcefully! Yes, like that! Good! Yes. "We have brought peace unto you," "we have brought peace unto you, we have brought peace..." Strong, strong! - And strengthening! Tomorrow at eight, school as usual! - Boo! We don't want school! We don't want school! This stupid school... - We don't want school! - How do you feel? - Splendid! Why? - This morning's migraine is gone? - It was just a headache. Good thing I went, then, instead of staying with you. Of course it's good. I wanted you to go. What did you think I didn't want you to go? I'm glad you went, and glad you cam back. How's your arm? Does it hurt? - No. - How was it? You said you wouldn't pick me up from field trips anymore. out here in front of everyone. - what's with you, Kauffman? Should I p romise, here and now? Don't promise, but try to get a grip on yourself. Yoni, you know it's only three days 'till Independence Day? We haven't made plans yet. Got anything in mind? - Dunno. We'll see. I had an idea... - What? It's a suprise. You'll see. Hello. - Hello. Same show as last year, again. All those fires and disasters. Enough! Did you get a load of Herzl? - Yeah, it's Adi. Curse him! Him and all his dimwit friends. Henja, we're going. - Why'd you call her? Come on. Yoni, where are you going? Be careful! Kauffman, you're Theodore Herzl! Kauffman! We keep getting people here from Europe. Refugees from the war. Sure. - Victims. Check out what just came in. Scope out that glass eye. It's revolting! Let's go. Does your mother know the war is starting again? - Not yet. Best she doesn't find out, right? If I said we were deposing a dictator, she'd understand. And what if she doesn't? Younatan, we know everything. We know you're losing the cast tomorrow and reorganizing. That's not true. You watch yourself, I'm not sparing you or anyone else. You're not scaring us. - Yeah? How about now? Mommy! A knife! Fire! After him! Younatan, you won't reform, The war ended a month ago, we won. Get it? Go home, mommy's boy! - Go play the piano, pianist! How was Jerusalem? Nice? - Noah says Jerusalem without the Wailing Wall We can do without that crown. When I'm older, I'll reconquer the whole old city! What a tan! That's some color you got there. Manly. The things we saw in Jerusalem! Some revisionists on the walls aimed their guns at us, and a tank passed us by, we touched the treads and turret. You want me to take you to the hospital for your cast, If the Arabs start with us again, we'll wipe them out. We'll settle our debts. - What debts? It's all over, right? Over? We thought up a way to reconquer the old city by now, we'll flank them from the mountains Yoni, the war's over. We're fine with Jerusalem as it is, and when the Arabs make peace, you can go to the Wall, if it matters so much to you. Noah knows nothing. He's not as smart as Ben Gurion, right? Then remember what Ben Gurion has to say about peace. you have to finish it! - You shouldn't start it. You don't know anything about politics. Look, youni, it's not even open to debate. We gave the angel of death our tithe, Damn your teacher to Hell, for making you soldiers now. He's making soldiers of us? Maybe a little Einschwein makes soldiers of us. Damn that fat cretin to Hell! - He's a decorated commander. Yoni, there won't be another war in the neighborhood. Yoni, it's over, isn't it? They jumped me, five to one. They broke the rules. They hurt our honor. I've got a score to settle, we need revenge! We're soldiers. You've no business getting revenge. You don't understand anything! Quiet, Palestina, go home! Go!, Go! Quiet! No singing! It's late at night! Go home, Palestina, home! You're getting dangerous! Soon we'll make a real soldier out of you, huh? We assaulted an outpost in the mountains with Noah today. Did the old man charge with you? You bet! He stumbled, but he got up and ran the whole way. Who was the enemy? - No one, It was just pretend. It was hot hard. - So, so. Imagine what it'd be like with a real enemy, raining bullets down on you, with the sun scorching you, the mosquitoes working their way everywhere, in every... It takes a lot of guts, right? - It takes faith, and courage. We had faith in our way, in our righteous struggle. With faith came courage. Which hill did you charge? Did Noah tell you? No, but there was a big rock, and pine trees. Imagine that was thet hill I fought on. - I wish! There's no sign of the mine that screwed me over, eh? Well, I'm glad you charged. Did you ration water? - Last thing we needed. How come? If you start something, do it all the way. This country needs tough people. Tough people. Dad, one is enough. - Never give anything back. I'm going to Haifa tomorrow. What? People are coming in from Poland. I'll be at the harbor. What do you want, Miriam? You want me to thank God Will you be at the harbor every week, until August? I can't afford these trips, A miser and an egotist, that's what you are. You hate me, I know that. - A miser and an egotist? Yes. You all hate me, you all make me miserable. Enough, let go, let me go! Go away! I want to go home! Do me a favor, enough with the hysterics, We didn't stop looking, not an instant in all these years. Well, tell him what you told me earlier. What is it? Tell him! We want to get revenge on Adi Kauffman. Adi Kauffman. One last battle, revenge for everything he's done to us. Yoni, there won't be another war. I can't take any more. It's been a month, I thought you'd calmed down. Why now? We were waiting for them to take off my cast. And you think you should start it all over again? Do you have a plan of action? Einschwein will be back tomorrow, we'll plan this out. There won't be another war here, Yitzhak. - Of course not. Take your plate and go to your room. The Voice of Israel from Jerusalem, good morning. "It is 7:00 AM, and here's Re'uma Eldar with the news." I don't see how a kids' game could get you so upset. "...the Russian delegation..." - But it's not a game. "Will vote to annex Jerusalem's new city areas to Israel," "and will dispute Abdallah's claim to the old city." "A prolonged firefight Took place last night" "between the defense forces and several intruders by Yahud." "The raiders escaped," "leaving behind tools and other agricultural goods" "they had plundered from the surrounding area." "Around the country, final preparations are being made" "for the Independence Day festivities." "Jerusalem is decked in blue and white in anticipation of" "the military parade which will take place in the afternoon..." Danny, this is a school, we don't play with slingshots. Jackass! "Yoni and Anna, sitting in a tree..." "Yoni and Anna, sitting in a tree..." Rileys! As usual, huh? Rileys, please go find out who's disgracing the memory of the heroic Shualei Shimshon, and have them cease their squawking at once! Go. Yes. Good, to your seat. Good for nothing. Go. Jackass! - You too! Pole! Yoni, sit down. "Bialik" "To the Bird" "Bialik - Our National Poet" "Be your return welcome, dear bird," "from warmer climes to my sill," "with a voice so honeyed my soul yearns for it" "in the winter, as you depart." Who chirped? Who chirped? Trough pain.. and torment, Ha'im Nachman Bialik expresses his longing for his homeland. And you joke like buffoons! Countless generations have wept and dreamt, and you joke like buffoons! But Bialik reached Israel, right? - Right, right, that he did, most certainly. Then why bother weeping? They should have broken the gentiles' arms and faces. They were just chickens, everyone in exile. My father knew Bialik, I know where he lives. Bialik, when he was your age, dwelt in a hostile land, persecuted... Do you see Einschwein? Einschwein! What did you say? What did you say? One moment, Get up. What did you just say? What did you say? What word did you use? He said "Einschwein". "Einschwein", Do you have any idea what you just said? Do you know the Germans called us "Schweine Jude"? Jewish swine. Who did you call that name? The fat guy. His dad died in the Independence War. What's he doing there? - Tubby. Whale. Sit down, all of you. Take your seats. All is lost. All is lost. Could you cut that out? - What gives? I'm rehearsing. Kauffman, the principal wants you. You're lucky. - Who's Avraham Rottenbach? This fat guy. Yo're Avraham Rottenbach? - Yeah. He wants you, too. Are you an Israeli hero's son? - Forget it. We've known for some time about the war you wage. We have other troops. - Please do not interrupt me. We also know Yonatan's arm was not broken playing soccer. Word of the violent and cruel misdeeds you perpetrate. You, who study in a school wholly of the working class, you, called upon to succeed the likes of A. D. Gordon and Haiim Brenner. You, who reside in the Holy Land, deny all that is sacred to our people. The people's eyes look to you, your persecuted brethren, legions of the pious, all look to you with fear and hope... Little scamp! What a burden rests upon your shoulders! What wondrous maturity history demands of you! What dire obligations fate has allotted you! You are called upon to create, build and fortify, Think. Ponder his marvelous duty bequealthed by history. you are depraved children, a destructive element. We will disgorge all hooligans from within our midst. Mister Kauffman, did you think I would pardon you uncionditionally, because you are an orphan? One more complaint, and you're out of this school. Out, out. As for you, mister Schreiber, you did a terrible thing during a lesson about our national poet. A terrible thing! After Independence Day, report here with your parents, without whom I do not want to see you in this school again. Never again! Understood? What is it? I... I didn't know it was a bad word in German. March! In the shack at three, an important staff meeting. What about? - We have to plan for battle, don't we? I have a surprise you won't believe, a new weapon. We'll make them bleed. Bleed. "Relative finding for the Jewish Agency," "the following names were received by the department:" "Yehoshua ben Shlomo Avramovitch, from lodz" "seeks his sister - Avramovitch" "who reached Israel in May of '39. - Lodz... - with 'haHalutz'" "apparently headed for a kibbutz in..." - Did you get it all? - No. Yeah, all of it. - Yes or no? - Yes. "Avraham ben Moshe Green, Ternopol, seeks his brother.." "Trompopopel. - ...who was in a concentration camp Dakhau," "and was transferred to Marseilles when the war ended." "Miriam and Israel Shapira from Lithuania" "seek relatives in the country." "Yaffa bat Leon from Slosnki" "seeks her sister, Rosa Leoni" "who left her town in 1943 and wasn't heard from since" "Piotr Kolodni of Krakowi" "seeks his nephew, son of Yitzhak Yossef Kolodni," "who fled to Paris during the war," "and died upon reaching Israel in early May of '48." Maybe the woman from Europe knows where our family is. I know where they are, I don't need to ask anyone. Then why do we listen to relative finding every day? Come to the table, I have to be back at the store. Was everyone on the broadcast in the war? Some of them. When will you tell me the full story of the Holocaust? Eat. - When? - When you're older. - I am older. Yoni, dad's waiting for me at the store, you know? Either way no one, can afford anything. I'll get it. "The Voice of Israel from Jerusalem, good afternoon," "it's 1:30, and here's Re'uma Eldar with.." It's Henja. "Our top story" "21 cannon shots, trumpets and boat foghorns" "will announce to the nation it's third Independence Day." "preparations spanning a week will end tomorrow.." What? "public and private buildings now sport flags..." We're going away. We're going to Haifa. Yoni's coming! - I have an urgent message... - Not now. What, are you going to spill water on the European woman? Tzvika, go get here here, bring her here. - But how? - Find a way, draw her here. - Okay. Come here, lady. - Why? Where? - Come here. - What's you names? Tzvika. - Tzvika. Sweetie, sweetie, sweetie. Taking walk. What, no friend? - Got'em. - Got friend. Stand, lady, stand. - Why? Wait, wait, where going? Really, there are too many immigrants around today. Yeah, the radio said 200,000 arrived just this year. Who needs them, anyway? They should stay in Europe. Yoni, what did you want to say earlier, in the street? Oh. Anatoly's leaving the neighborhood, moving to Haifa. Haifa. - Who said that? His mother spoke to mine. Then we're five versus four! Victory is ours! Attention! You know what people mean when they talk about Haifa? - No. Well, fine, maybe the really are moving to Haifa. She really said "Haifa". Your watch is up, get on the tower. - Yes, sir! Now will you show us the new weapon? - Come in, come in, Sit, sit. Are these the pine cones form Jerusalem? - Yeah. My dad was brave, he killed Arabs with his bare hands, until they killed him. - And why'd the kill him? Because bare hands aren't how you win a modern war. In moder warfare, you need modern weaponry. Not pebbles or peach pits, not even pine cones from Jerusalem. You need something strong and cruel to ensure victory. In Haifa, I was shown this weapon. It.. It's a gun! A real gun. A sling gun. The barrel's like an ordinary gun's. Here's the ammo. It's iron. Rusty. You could kill someone with this. - Right. Let me show you how it works. Einschwein! There's a pigeon. - Where? - No, not it. Shoot it. Einschwein, You're out of range, the're lots of other ragets. - Einschwein, what's going on? - Quiet. - Einschwein, it's not the only target. - Shoot it! - Einsch... Einschwein, no! - Quiet. No! You killed it. - Wow! It's so powerful! Kids, what are you doing here?! Bastards! You're hoodlums! Worse than Poland! The education in this country...! Get out of here! Go back to Europe! Germans on you! You nearly broke my skull. What's going on there? I nearly got killed. you should be ashamed of yourselves... It's so powerful! It's too dangerous for street wars. Nothing's too dangerous. - This is going too far. Nothing too far about it. Aren't knives going too far? If Adi's screwed up enough to use that sort of weapon, doesn't mean we should use one, too. If we hurt someone with this gun, we'll all be expelled. No one's getting expelled. - This gun's for real wars. Aren't knives for real wars? - Listen! We'll only aim for the legs. Maybe the arms. That's an order. I'll shoot Adi. If that's an order, we'll lose this war. We'll need boards, broomsticks rubber bands and metal wires. I already have some wire from the stage at school. Yoni and Danny, scrounge up things near Machlof. Tzvika and Shmulik, search between houses. I'm going to make some arrangements We'll rendezvous in Yoni's apartment in an hour. God told Ben Gurion "It shall be good," "there shall be peace", he said "the Messiah will come," "The Messiah will come!" "we have a country, we have... land." Thus spoke the Lord, "God forgives, Palestina forgives," "everyone will come." It is written, "Jews will come, everyone will come, there'll be peace," "there'll be a country, Jews won't die, kids won't die," "everyone will come home, Jewish kids won't die," "kids won't die, everyone will come to Palestina." "No one will die, everyone will laugh, Jews will laugh," so says the Bible. Lunatic! Lunatic! Lunatic! Lunatic! Lunatic! Lunatic! What are those sticks for? They probably want to build something. Give me a nail. Palestina saw us swipethe planks, she got scared and ran off, hid behind some shack, like something unreal. Nutter. She saw her kids get shot, in Europe. Her parents and her kids. Nearly everyone fom Europe lost an uncle or grandparent, right, Einschwein? - Anyone, who didn't run got killed. Our family got away. So where are they now? Poland, jerk. My mother said once they open the gates, they'll come here. My grandparents and cousins all died in the Holocaust. Curse their names, the Germans. Just you wait 'till our army can pay everyone back. They always killed our people, now we'll kill theirs. - Who's? Who could that be? Who's there? Who's there? Yonatan, open the door! It's Adi. I want Einschwein to come face me in a duel. Einschwein's not here. - You liar, Tzvika, I can smell him from out here. If you don't open up. I'll break in! - You wouldn't dare. I'm counting to three! - Creep. - One... - Murderer! ...two, three! Murderous batard, your days are numbered! Tomorrow, alfter the play at school, we get even. I'll plan it all out. Follow me! They trashed your house? It's because you won't obey your parents. Where are you going? Are you running away? Could you take me with you? I saw you come here. Did you come to drive Palestina nuts? I'm not in the neighborhood war anymore, we're going away. I know. How do you know? Your mother came over and told us this afternoon. we're not going to Haifa, but leaving the country. - What? When someone's ashamed to be leaving, they say "Haifa". I might run away, too. - Because of the war? After Kauffman's Pogrom, my parents'll never forgive me. They won't let me fight. Then just don't. I won't stop. I'm on my way to my ocean hideout, I may stay there a few days after the revenge battle. Can you keep a secret? - Yes. Then come with me. But I have to go home now. I'll run away and come back to Israel, you'll see! Mom, is this because of the door. It was nothing. I'm here. Talk to me! I wasn't the one who broke it, it's a game. Just a game! Open this door! Yonatan, open the door! You'll pay dearly for this! - I... I want to talk. Talk? Yes. - We've had enough talk. You never let me talk. - Open up! Only if you promise not to hit me. - Open up! You renewed the war. - I can't stop, Adi mustn't win. He's a tyrant, he's vicious! Have you tried seeing his side? The kid grew up without parents. No one knows what horrible end they met in Europe. We don't want to kill him; we'll hurt him so much no one will want to fight with him. We'll disband his gang, once and for all. You want to have an attack which may hurt other kids, with only remote chances of success. Like the War of Independence? And Normandy? El Alamein? You can't make examples of grown up wars, They're exactly the same, we checked. Your war is dangerous and unnecessary. It's child's play, like every other neighborhood. - Not ours. But why? - You'll understand When you're older. Because of the Holocaust? - Because we tell you. We know it is. We can play what we want, just butt out, You can't intefere. Oh, we'll intefere, all right! We swore, we have rules. You can't intefere. I'll say this one last time: There won't be another war! Can't help it. We'll see what you can... and can't help. No, dad, not the belt, please! You promised! Where will you go? There's no place for you here! You hear me? The war is over. Got it? Over! Over! Over! Let go of me! - Let go of me! - Enough! Enough! Over! Maybe he really did go to his uncle in the kibbutz. Yoni didn't go, this fight means more to him than to us. Fine, where is he, then? - He'll be here. If not, we start anyway, we can't miss this opportunity. Beraleh, get up, scram! - What? Get out of here! Scram, go away! - What wicked kids! - Run off! Go away! Maybe he got scared, bolted. - Yoni's much braver than you! You shut up, you never even wanted this war! Really? Says who? We saw you wet yourself after we shot that pigeon. I did not wet myself! - You're a cowardly son of a coward! And this weapon will bring us victory! Don't you call my dad a coward! Your dad wasn't in the War of Independence, we all know. Your mom sells things on the black market, we all know. "Your mom, your dad", barely an hour before the battle. What are we, the Egyptian army? At last. - Knew you'd come. Where from? - Ocean hideout. Alone, at night? I'll go back after the war. Your dad came over, looking for you. They found out in the morning, he's at the kibbutz now. Why'd you run, did they smack you around? My dad, and how. And my mom, with her charades... I'll show them! The're looking for you like crazy - That oughta teach 'em! Come on, we're short on time, we'll talk later. Shmulik, tell Yoni the plan on the way to the play. I'm not going there, I'll get caught. So you'll wait in the street? You'll get nabbed for sure. Come to the play and hide, then, strike when we do. Take these rifles, form a line in front of the target. Ok, look, during the play, 'Schwein'll get the principal to go through Adi's pockets, even though we know he gave the knife back already. Then we run to the shack and get the rifles prepped. The moment they leave, they blunder into our ambush. What if Adi comes after us? He can't, he's in the play. It's not much of a plan. Load rifles. Take aim... Fire! Very good, very good, Yoni! I see Adi's in for a surprise today. "The Jewish Question exists, whether recognized or not." "It is neither a religious problem, nor a social one," "but a national one, with but one solution:" "a return to Israel, to our homeland of youre." "Throughout our history," "we have not ceased to dream: Next year in Jerusalem." "Now is the time to fulfill this dream and found a nation," "the Jewish state." "Uproarious was the response to the call of the visionary," "Benjamin ze'ev Herzl. Echoed the world over," "from the futhest reaches of the earth..." "the people responded with one..." - voice... "Never again!" What gives? Let go! Kauffman, this is your end! Hey, kid, kid, where to? Leave the door that way, leave it open for Tzvika. Where are you going, kids? What is all this? Where are you going, kids? What is all this? Wait for me here, I'll go get my knife. My gun's here, I left yours at home, to be safe. Now we'll show 'em what we're made of. I'm going up, to get the guns. Wait for me here. Damn... Bastard! - Fatty! Meanie! - Moron! - Ox! Einschwein, I found ammo! On them! I'll kill you. Kill him, shoot him! Shoot him, for all he's done to us! Shoot him, Don't be scared, shoot, shoot! Kill him! Kill him! It's against the rules. - Don't be scared! Shoot him! - It's not fair. - Shoot him! He broke your arm! No mercy! Don't be scared! Shoot him! Break his head! Shoot him! Don't be scared! What happend? You killed him! Education's to blame, it's as though they were gentiles! No good! No good! Sand. Palestina fix wound. My... ...little boy. My little boy. Why? Why? Come. Don't be afraid, boy. Palestina likes boy. Go. Sit. Palestina fix wound, yes? Sand. No good. Hurts? Is that you? These are your kids. You had kids. Where is this? Who are they? Did they shoot them? The Nazis shot them. Everyone will come. Everyone is coming. Mother, father, grandfather, grandmother, they're all coming. Son, daughter, cat. Everyone's coming. Palestina is waiting. Here, by the sea. "Shoot him! Kill him!" "Kill him! Break his head! Don't be scared" "For everything he's done to us! Break his head!" Why? Why, boy? No crying, no, big boy, hero soldier boy. Hero soldier boy, in land of Palestina! No crying. "This is not your last trek, you must never say die," "though clouds banish the sun from the sky," "The time for which we've longed draws ever more near," "our footfalls shall sound, we are here, we are here!" "Palestina's nuts as can be and pissed into the sea," "Palestina's nuts as can be and pissed into the sea," "Palestina, give a fig, the consul dines on pig," "Palestina, give a fig, the consul dines on pig," Forget her, let's go see Yoni, at the hideout! Let's handle her first, then Yoni! Get out! - Get out! Get out, Palestina! Get out! - Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Come out, already! What are you doing there, Yoni? What happend? Yoni, we brought food and blankets, since you'll have to hide. Come on, Yoni! - Come on! Is Adi alive? He is. They took him to Hadassa hospital. He won't show his face in the neighborhood again! Hear that? He's alive! Adi's grandma was at your parents' shop, she talked to your mother, maybe you should just set sail for Europe. You're a hero! Three cheers for Yoni, the heroic victor. Hip, hip! - Hurrah! Hip, hip! - Hurrah! Hip, hip! - Hurrah! Yoni, what is it? What did she do to you? Come on Yoni! - She enchanted him! Yoni, come on! Come check out all the fish. - Yoni From hardcoded subs made by dhigmoore
