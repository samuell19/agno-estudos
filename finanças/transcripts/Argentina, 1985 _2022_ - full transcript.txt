INSPIRED BY TRUE EVENTS On December of 1983, Argentina recovers its democracy after seven years of military dictatorship. Alfonsín orders to take the former commanders to trial for crimes against humanity. The commanders feel like winners in a war against subversion, only accepting to be tried by a military court. It's been seven months since the new government took office, and the trial hasn't moved forward. The rumor that the trial could be taken by the civil justice spreads fast. If that were to happen, the Federal Court of Appeals would have to take the trial. The accusation responsibility would fall on its sole prosecutor: Julio Strassera. - So? - She came and locked herself in her room. - Locked the door? - Yes. She just got here. Come. Go on, talk. He picked her up at Bettina's. They went to a bar and stayed there for a while. - What bar? - Plus Ultra. Libertad and Arenales Street. And then? Then, I left. - How come you left? - Yes, I stayed out there for an hour. - I don't like that guy. - Me neither. What are you up to? What are you whispering about? - Nothing. - Nothing. We're worried about Vero. Why? Her new boyfriend is very strange. - Strange? How do you know he's strange? - Yeah. How'd you get to that conclusion? I have the suspicion he might be a mole. They might be trying to get to me through her. A mole? It means a spy, Mom. I know what a mole is, honey. Javi, go to bed. Go. - Put your pajamas on. - Okay. Don't sleep in your joggers! I'm waiting for an explanation. They meet at Plus Ultra. Doesn't that tell you anything? No. On the corner of the Secretariat of Intelligence. Are you kidding me? Are you following our daughter? - No. - Julio. - Are you having your daughter followed? - Javier ran into her in the street. Julio! Are you making your son follow your daughter? I just told you I didn't. You're sick. We know he's the cousin of that girl from school. - Granddaughter of a pilot. - A civilian. - Civilian pilot! - At LADE. LADE. They're all kind of military. They volunteered for war. Her grandfather and her father! Do you realize you're raising a lunatic? - What? - Why are you putting makeup on? Because I want to, and I can. We live in democracy, right? My school forbids it. How do you know? You never wore makeup to school. - Yet. - No, no! - Stop it! - Come on, Javier, you'll look so pretty! - Idiot! - Let's go. Enough, just stop it. I'll go this way. - Can I have one, Dad? - Sure. - Want to have lunch? - I can't today. I didn't say when. I thought you meant today. - Whenever you can. - I'd love to. Whenever you can. - Bye, see you tonight. - Okay. Bye. Good morning. Bruzzo called. Sir, Mr. Bruzzo called. He said it was urgent. I heard you. And if I don't want to talk to him? - Can you do that? - Of course I can. - What should I do if he calls again? - You hang up. - I can't, sir. - Yes, you can. You can and you must. It's an order. You hang up on Bruzzo. - Remember, you work for me. - No, sir, I'm permanent staff. You can't fire me. Susana. Please. Hang up on Bruzzo. Thanks. - Sir. - I beg you not to ruin this moment for me. - Bruzzo. - What? He's on his way. - You despise me, don't you? - If I did, I wouldn't be warning you. You're right. Listen. I'm not here, I left. Tell him I had a lunch with my daughter. - I'll handle it. - Thanks. JULY 4TH, 1984, "NEVER AGAIN:" CONADEP SPECIAL BROADCAST You'll witness a report by the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons Wounds that will obviously be reflected in the testimonies... How much longer? No more than five seconds. Listen. What you're about to watch is just one side of the drama and the violence in Argentina. There he goes. The other side, the other aspect of it started when subversion and terror docked on Argentina's shores, ANTONIO TRÓCCOLI SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY supported by distant places... Why didn't they put Massera to speak? - It's over. That's it. - No! Javi, can you turn it on, please? This subversive strategy... - What is he saying? - What did you expect? Complex situation for our country. I'll get it. A weakened society that didn't have... What is he saying? This is a dictatorship announcement. Nor the political maturity... I'll be right back! You were supposed to talk about the disappeared ones! See what I mean now? Into the diabolical spiral of death and terror. Our society has been moved and shocked, and demanded to put an end to this subversive attack... No, no, you're blaming the victims! - Hey, what's up? - How are you? - Fine, and you? - Fine too. The disappeared ones. A condition that affected several Argentinians, a tragic and unprecedented situation that stabbed our history in the back and moved the whole world. Many saw how their loved ones... were taken from their homes to remain disappeared since then. My daughter, Laura Estela Carlotto, was kidnapped along with her partner. She was 21 years old. She was 10 weeks pregnant. We heard about her during her kidnap, through an anonymous letter, saying she was still pregnant, that she was sending me and her dad a message, so that we were on the lookout for when she gave birth. During that time, as any mother would, I looked for her, gathered information. Our daily hope was... that she would show up at home one day. I've filed petitions for habeas corpus. I've filed lawsuits... Bruzzo is in there. Man, can you get in, please? Yes, sure. Here. Thank you. Sit down, please. Listen, Bruzzo, I won't argue with you. I respect and esteem you. I'm grateful for my appointment and all, but there's something I'm not willing to be. You know? You know what I'm not willing to be? - I can imagine, Julio. - A moron. Is that what you were thinking? I won't be the moron who has to defend something the government doesn't believe in. - Julio. - What? Are we suddenly living in Wonderland? All of a sudden, all dictators will go to jail. Who will put them in jail? Martín Karadagian? Do you really think the military court will put General Videla in jail? They were part of it, Bruzzo. What if the civilian court handles the trial? I'm called Madman, but I'm not. That won't happen. Who'll allow that? Tróccoli? Did you listen to him last night? Give me a break. Are you done? Sit down, please. Sit, Julio! You realize that if the judges agree to take the trial, you can't decline? I know perfectly well what my job entails. I'm a prosecutor. Can you tell me how it was? I'd rather not talk about it, Silvia. - They're doing it, right? - I don't want to talk about it, Silvia. So they will. They can't do it. Yes, they can. You know that if the judges want a trial, it'll happen. They won't let them. You don't know that. Can we not talk about that? - What do you want to talk about? - Nothing. There's something I don't get. Please, don't put me in a bad mood. - I don't get if you're like this... - Silvia. - Because you're afraid... - Please. - That this thing won't happen. - Silvia. Or you're afraid it will happen. Sometimes, I feel like you're scared shitless. Of course I'm scared shitless. Of course. - What are you afraid of? - Everything, Silvia! Everything! Of this being a trap, of me being used for some kind of negotiation. Of something happening to you guys. And not being able to do anything? Again? You can do this, Julio. You can. SEPTEMBER 25TH, 1984 ARMED FORCES COUNCIL - Submit it. - Yes, sir. Well, thank you, gentlemen. ARMED FORCES COUNCIL Morning. This ruling is from the Armed Forces Council. "This Council informs that according to its investigation, "the decrees, directives, orders and military procedures "which were issued to combat the stateless subversion," "were in content and form, unobjectionable." - Unobjectionable. - As you heard. Keep reading. "The excesses were committed by the subordinates." "The court should investigate the offenses of the alleged victims..." Offenses of the victims? COURT OF APPEALS Are we taking this trial? Excuse me, but we should stay objective, think about the risks, and if we can guarantee the trial will follow procedure. You think we can leave it like this? They're blaming the victims. We mustn't act blindly. If we don't act blindly, and now, this trial might not happen. Let's give them what they didn't give their victims. A fair trial. - And the evidence? - Up to the prosecutor. And if they can't get them? If they don't, we'll have to absolve. Shall we notify the prosecutor? Let him know. - Excuse me, sir. - Yes. - This has just arrived. - Yes. Let me see. Thank you. - Hi. - Hello. - Dad. - What's up? Did something happen? - Yes. - What? Mr. Strassera is busy. The trial will happen. You're putting Videla in jail. I'll try. And Massera. Everyone who's responsible. Isn't that dangerous? I guess it's a little dangerous. Well, they can kill you. Can't you say no? No. It is hereby informed that the prosecution has been notified... DR. ALBERTO MUCHNIK ATTORNEY Mr. Prosecutor. Poor Schubert. Hey. - How are you? - Fine, I'll spare you the details. They screwed you big time, man. You thought they appointed you to sweep the dance floor, and now you'll have to dance. What are you laughing about? This is serious. Very serious. - I can't do this. Think about it. - You had to start eventually. But now? Right at this moment? Everyone knows they negotiate with the military. - Did you listen to Tróccoli? - Yes, Tróccoli. You're right. I agree with you, I do. I've been telling you this will go to shit for 50 years. New government says they'll change things, and then appoints the same assholes as always. Well... I'll tell you something. Listen. Something can go wrong. Someone gets distracted, right? And there's a gap, a thin one. A crack. That's it. It opens and closes quickly. When it opens, you have to be in there, and then, yes... Then you can do something. The things we couldn't do during the dictatorship, Julio. That's how important things were done. They were done with intelligence, with boldness, with wit, to get in there. You're talking about history? Yes. History... - wasn't made by guys like me. - No? You don't say. However, you'll be the prosecutor on the most important trial of Argentina's history. Own up to it. Julio, Julio, Julio! I like seeing you laugh. Come on. Someone get the phone, please! God, it's driving me crazy! Javi, can you pick up? - Hello? - Julio Strassera? Is that you? Yes, who is this? Are you Javier and Verónica's father? - Who is this? - The guy who will kill you. - You know what? - What? First, we'll go after your son. But we'll keep your daughter, who's quite the looker. - Fuck you, motherfucker. - So we can entertain ourselves. - Why don't you say it to my face? - Be careful, asshole. You don't want to mess with this. You don't want any regrets. Okay, I'll keep that in mind. Thanks. - Who was that? - A friend. Dad? - Silvia! - Who was it? From now on, only you and me get the phone, okay? The threats guy again? He's been calling all day. I'm sick of him. Seems he has nothing else to do. Wait. What? I don't know. - Let's take the subway. - Okay. Bye. Have a nice day. - Dad. - Yes? Take care of yourself. Mr. Strassera, sorry to interrupt. I was appointed as your security chief. I don't need security. I heard you and your family were threatened. I won't accept any security. I understand. Threats aren't important. The ones who harm don't give warnings. - That's why... - Look, man, I don't want the services nor the police near me or my family. Respectfully, I went to your house to see your wife and daughter. I'm in charge of their security too. - Your name? - Antz, sir. - Your name, Officer. - Antz, sir. Your last name is Ants? Yes, my family name. With a Z. - This is Romero. - Nice to meet you, sir. Forgive me, Antz. You've met my daughter. I must warn you. - My daughter is a very private person. - I'm aware, sir. - Of what? - Your family's safety. How can I put this? - We had to make some inquiries. - What did you find out? Nothing to worry about, sir. - Nothing? - Well... - No threats to your safety. - Tell me what you know, please. Spit it. Mr. Padilla is married. - Does my daughter know? - We believe she doesn't. I'm sure she doesn't. Mrs. Padilla doesn't either. I'm off. What's up, Bruzzo? Thanks for the visit, but I'm about to have the most important trial since Nürnberg, so let's not waste time. I came to offer help. Yes, got it, Atom Ant. Thanks. Not the security. When I need other type of help, I'll call you. Don't be stubborn. - You can't do this alone. - I won't. I'll have my team. I can create a team, right? Yes, but it won't be easy. Not many at the court agree with what we'll... First, there's no "we." Me, I'm doing it. Second, I have people working with me. - So... - There isn't much time. You can't do it alone. By alone, I also mean your theater friend. My theater friend has more experience in trials than you and me both. He's been an attorney for 30 years. Bruzzo, I'll do this, but I'll do it my way. You won't make it in time. Listen to me. - The attorney general will send someone. - Don't! I'll do it with my people. I'll call Telechea, Salvador and Sturla. Sturla said no? Yes, he said no. He doesn't want to be part of this. He's too old for these things. - Old? Why? How old is he? - He's 78. - Already? - He's old. - Telechea? - He said no. Did he say why? He laughed. "Strassera wants to put the military in jail?" "Why doesn't he box against Durán too?" Funny guy, Telechea. Asshole. - Telechea never liked trouble. - No. - And Salvador? - Didn't even call him. He signed a petition against the trial. - Seriously? What a fascist! - He slowly became one. Classic. - Carrizo? - No. - He was Manrique's candidate. - No. Remember? - Girardi? - No. No, he's a fascist. His kids go to military school. - Really? - Yes. I didn't know. Bruni? Super fascist. Héctor Alcides? What? He died last year. You don't say! I didn't know. What a pity. Major heart attack. He would have said no. He was super fascist. - Wait. - What? - No, a fascist. - Who? No, he's super fascist. Fuck me! There's no one. OCTOBER 25TH, 1984 PRELIMINARY HEARINGS Madman Strassera in the flesh. - National Prosecutor. - How are you, Basile? Here I am, making a living. Like you, I guess. Let's say there are different ways of making a living. If it's about my client, I was appointed by the court as public defender. Doesn't seem to bother you. One would say you hit the jackpot. Does it bother me? No. Not at all. What honestly shocks me is you defending guerrillas. I don't defend anyone. - I'm a prosecutor. My job is to accuse. - Morning, Basile. You mean accusing those who defended our land from guerrillas. - See you. - Go, sit. This won't take long. At 5:00, sharp. Good morning. All rise. I hereby declare the preliminary hearings of case 13/84 open, prosecuting the following officers of the Armed Forces. Lieutenant General Jorge Rafael Videla... Excuse me, young man. - Who are you? - Luis Moreno Ocampo. - El Mono Campo? - Luis Moreno Ocampo. - I'm here at your service. - No one informed me. I'm the deputy prosecutor. - What? - I'm your deputy prosecutor, sir. Bring the defendants in. Good morning. State your name, please. Jorge Rafael Videla, and let me add, Lieutenant General of the Argentinian Army. Your Honors, with all due respect, I do not recognize the legitimacy of this court. The defense reaffirms the alleged crimes correspond to the military jurisdiction, and as such, should be judged by the military court. The military court had its chance. You perfectly know this court's authority to investigate and judge these crimes. State your full name. Orlando Ramón Agosti. I don't recognize the legitimacy of this court. - Full name, please. - Roberto Eduardo Viola, and I don't recognize the legitimacy of this court. Omar Domingo Rubens Graffigna. I don't recognize... - Jorge Isaac Anaya. - Basilio Arturo Lami Dozo. - Admiral Armando Lambruschini. - Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri. Admiral Emilio Eduardo Massera. I don't recognize the legitimacy of this court. Tell me. Videla's much shorter than I thought. A dwarf. With the hat and the boots, he looks taller. - Who's this guy? - The help we were expecting. Tell me, Luis María Campos. How will you help us? How many trials have you been in? Moreno Ocampo. No trials. How many prosecutions? - None. - For God's sake. What do you do, then? I work for the attorney general. I'm a professor. - You make a living, Molina Campos? - Moreno. Sort of. Does your mom help you? Mom hates the fact that I'll work for this trial. - Why do it, then? - Maybe that's why. - Do you really want to know why me? - Sure. My family's in the military. My uncle's a colonel. That doesn't help you. My mom goes to church every Sunday with Videla. To her, he did the right thing. - I won't hear another word. - Let's go. Sir. Sir! Sir, let me finish, please. Think about it. This government just took office. A weak government, with the military breathing down its neck. - Yes. - They took a dangerous, but correct decision to bring them to court. That's why I think it's a good idea to have young lawyers, instead of lawyers committed to human right causes, who could be discredited as communists. Not only by the military, but also by the middle class, whom we have to convince for this trial to have the legitimacy it needs, taking into account the tendency of the middle class to justify any military coup. The Trojan horse. Get it? We have five months to submit irrefutable evidence against nine commanders. On homicides, unlawful deprivation of liberty, torture and aggravated larceny. - We need a team right away. - Exactly, Molina Campos. Moreno Ocampo. We can't trust the police. Around 90% of the judiciary staff doesn't want to get involved in the trial. More like 99%. - We need to look elsewhere. - Where? Law school? Not exactly, but close. At the attorney general's there's kids willing to work with us. - Kids? - Yes. In every court. We need younger people with less experience. Less than you? - If the experienced won't do it... - Then, we bring the inexperienced. Okay. I'm starting to like you, Moreno Ocampo. - Did I say that right? - Yes. Full name? - Lucas Palacios. - Judith König. Federico Corrales. Occupation? Administrative duties at the attorney general's office. - Profession? - I'm a lawyer. I'm currently unemployed. - What did you do before? - I was in the military. - Which branch? - The Navy. At the ESMA, School of Mechanics. Come on, Fede. - You're joking. - Yes. I work at the attorney general's. Who did you vote for on the last election? Should I say Alfonsín? Or the truth? I didn't vote. - You didn't? Why? - I was 17. Your thoughts on Balbín? No thoughts. He was an important politician. Political preferences, Eduardo? Now? No. None, zero. - Thoughts on Perón? - He was an important politician. What about Winston Churchill? - What? - Napoleon Bonaparte? Jesus Christ? Do I have to answer? Can you name five members of the current cabinet? Yes. There is... Grispun. - Grinspun. - That one. - Who did you vote for? - Peronism. - Why? - I'm a Peronist. You don't say. Why? It's the only movement that stood against all dictatorships since 1955, and will always fight for social justice. Okay. Thank you. - Thank you. - You asked. But not for you to repeat the same bullshit I hear you say at home. Don't be aggressive, Dad. You get me like this, Maco. Why do you want to work with us? I have an uncle who was abducted for six months and barely made it. I work at the reception desk on Court 14. Nobody there cares about what you'll do. I do. I have two kids, a mortgage, and I heard you pay overtime here. We will inherit this country, and this can't happen again. You pay overtime, right? Want me here or not? I'm fine where I am. - I don't like being around anti-Peronists. - Welcome, Maco. Your dad spoke highly of you. I'm Luis Moreno Ocampo, Deputy Prosecutor. Deputy Prosecutor? Is that a thing? Can you name four guests at the Badía show last week? - Yes, Los Abuelos played. - Los Abuelos? Los Abuelos de la Nada. Was great. - Haven't you heard of them? - No. Sing a song. - Now? - Yes. FEBRUARY Okay, first problem. Time. We have to conduct the most important trial in our history in less time than it takes to judge a chicken thief. We're here now. Everything must be ready by this day. FEBRUARY 1985 We only have those days. What should we do? What prisoners do. Okay. Second problem. We need to prove it was a systematic plan. That is, they all knew what was happening, and how it was happening. And it was across the country, during the administrations of all commanders. They are responsible. We can't work with the police, because they were involved too. Another problem. Courts won't share information. When they do, it's late. - Don't forget... - Less than the thief. - Yes, funny guy. - Let's get organized. First, let's pin the secret detention centers in the map. - La Perla was in Córdoba. - What else? - The ESMA. - Yes, the ESMA. - The ESMA, the Navy. - What else? - El Vesubio. - What else? - Campo de Mayo. - What do you think? - How much time left? - Four months and two weeks. Is that a joke? That's impossible. Just withdraw. That's not an option. What else can you think of? Talk to María Eugenia. She runs the Commission's archives. Knows the ropes there. She'll help you. The prosecution said to review all cases. - All? Do you know how many there are? - No. - You'll have to choose. - Just keep them coming. Have you made a pre-selection? Watts, Meijide, Dalego, Avellaneda, Valenzi... We'll read all of them. All of them? - Prosecutor Strassera's assistants? - Yes. We'll provide all the information you need. MOTHERS OF PLAZA DE MAYO Hope the prosecutor behaves better than in the dictatorship. But during the dictatorship, he didn't do... Anything. Nothing. "'Mom, tell him Dad ran away, please, ' he said. "It was the last time I heard his voice." "Then they took him away." DECEMBER The responsibility of command lies in the Juntas. They were in charge, that part is clear. - But it's the hardest to prove. - Why is it hard? The kidnappings, tortures and killings have been or can be proved. How can we prove they knew? - They couldn't not know. - They'll say they didn't know. "They were excessive actions by subordinates." "I can't watch over each of them in the middle of a war." - Yes, but 30,000 excessive actions? - Yes, he's right. They can say, "I didn't kill anyone. I didn't torture anyone." - "I didn't order disappearances." - "Can't use a stun gun." We need witnesses that saw them at the centers. What if nobody saw them? That was part of the plan, right? Not to be linked with the killings and disappearances. - Someone must've seen them. - No. Let's focus on the plan. Prove they did the same thing all over the country. They abducted people everywhere. Held them in secret detention centers. Tortured them during interrogations. People disappeared all over the country. Guys, if we can prove that, we can prove this was coordinated. - That's what we need. - So, we take the cases, and organize them by branch, year, detention center... - By region. - By region? - Will we travel? - Yes. Where would you like to go? Thank you. - They're waiting for us. - Did you see the mountain? I knew it. This city's full of fascists. Do you know this guy? - Two blocks that way. - That way. Come. Are you sure? I'll go that way. Meet you later. Hi. Hi, excuse me. Good morning. I'm looking for Juan Pablo Noriega... Nothing here. Okay, thank you. Ask that guy. Excuse me, sir? We can't work here. - Fascists, I told you. - What should we do? Gather everyone, we're going somewhere else. What should we do? Hold this. THE PROSECUTORS VISIT THE PROVINCE This can be very important, because they can bring... tools to bring more cases. These people come from the prosecution. We're looking for those who have information about crimes committed during the dictatorship for the trial led by Prosecutor Strassera in Buenos Aires. Any information, name or data... Police, open the door! Open the door! Go to the Department of Justice on 2800 Mitre Street, or call 524096... Three people took me from my cell. I was blindfolded. They stripped me naked. They did what they call "the submarine." Put your head in a bucket full of water until you can't take it. They asked absurd things. "What is communism?" I had no idea. Then, they asked if I knew where Firmenich lived or other names I didn't know. That made them furious. Chains on your ankles and give you numbers. X-96. From that moment, I wasn't Mario Valle anymore. - I'm blindfolded. They hit me with a gun. - They open the trunk... - with a stun gun. - I started vomiting. I couldn't drink water. I was charged with electricity. Do you know if your neighbors saw the people who took you? How did you know they were from the army? Hi, honey. What's up? - I was waiting for you. - I see. Did something happen? Sit down, please. Sure. - Abel and I are done. - Who? Dad. I'm sorry, I don't like this guy. I don't know if you know... - He's married. - Yes. I'm not dumb, Dad. I always knew he was. And he never asked about you. I don't think he knows about your work. Don't spy on me, okay? And don't send Javier. - You scare him. - Okay. You have more important things to worry about. I'm sorry. DECEMBER JANUARY FEBRUARY 15TH SUBMISSION OF EVIDENCE Quilmes, Avellaneda. FEBRUARY Where? On the third shelf. One, two... - Is this okay? - The ESMA is on that shelf. Has anyone seen... Here are three from the ESMA. - Mr. Prosecutor. - Yes? Here's your evidence. There are 16 volumes, 4,000 pages, 709 cases and over 800 witnesses. Great job. Congratulations. - Submit it. - What? You're coming with us! - Come on. - Where? - To submit it! - Come on! Submit it alone? No. Together. Yes, come with us. What's going on? Prosecutor Strassera, leader of the case. - My pleasure. - A pleasure. Congratulations, man. Where did you find them? The Scouts? I suggest you pay more attention to the eloquence of the evidence, than the youth of my team. Mark my words. I know what I'm saying. Good luck. Shall we? Everything. Sir! There he is. Sir, please. One question, sir! Do you think the amount of evidence will be enough? The quantity and quality of the evidence is overwhelming. Let me tell you, we achieved this in record time. Thanks to all these young people and Mr. Moreno Ocampo, my work partner. - Were you threatened? - I prefer to ignore that. If you'll excuse me. Sir, excuse me. Is it true you were threatened? THE GREAT TRIAL WHO IS STRASSERA STRASSERA'S KIDS STRASSERA'S SECOND-IN-COMMAND - Hi, how are you? - Good evening. Sorry. - Nice article in the magazine. - Thanks. I was being ironic. - You didn't like it? - No. Everyone up there read it. - And that's bad? - Terrible. - Shall I leave? - Don't even think about it. These are your great-uncles. Last thing we need is for you to be a wuss. Let's have a drink. - Champagne? - Yes. That guy recognized you. Another one. Thank God your uncle hasn't seen you yet. - Where is he? - I won't tell you. Is that true? A lot? Don't look. - Don't look! - You told him it's not against him, right? - No. - Why? He doesn't think it's against him. He thinks it's against him, the family and the country. Perla? - Colonel! - It's you. How are you? It's been ages! - And your wife? - Travelling. - Again? - Yes. - Where? - Milan. Thank you. Uncle. Sorry to interrupt. May I speak to you for a moment? I am Major General Ocampo to you. I'm sorry, General. - Can we speak? - A question, Counselor. Do you think you will win that trial? I don't know. Do you think the military did the right thing? - It was a war, Counselor. - A war of the state against society? Against armed groups that threatened... Which should have been tried for their hypothetical crimes. Not kidnapped, tortured, murdered and disappeared. Well, what's going on here? What did we say? We don't talk politics in this family. - Luis, come with me. - Excuse me. Everyone here needs to know... All good, sir? Yes. I'm fine. Do you need a ride? No. No, thank you. APRIL 22ND, 1985 BEGINNING OF PUBLIC HEARINGS The Foreign Office says Clyde Snow arrives tomorrow. He'll be protected. The embassy is collaborating. Yes. - We'll be fine. - Yes. - Okay. - Yes. Hear me out. Let's not push it. - It's the first week, okay? - Yes, yes. - Will you only say yes? - No. - Loza, a minute. - Strassera. Sir. - Excuse me. - Yes, tell me. Is that man with you? No. He can't be here. Go check who he is. Okay. - Gentleman, please. - Sorry, I was just leaving. So? You'll just let him go? Relax, young man. Everything's under control. - No, no, I didn't... - We'll delay it... - No, I don't want to change anything. - Julio. - Julio. - One second. What? There was a man there. - He may be a mole. - How do you know? Second time I see him. Can someone please pick up that phone? It's been ringing for five minutes. - Please! - Pick it up, please. Hello? With all due respect, I can assure there's no bomb. How can you guarantee that? It's obvious. It's an operation to terrorize society. This is an insult, Your Honor. This chamber's duty is to carry a safe procedure, for defendants and witnesses. A safe procedure? Is that a joke? The witnesses and us have been threatened for six months! The defense claims the safety of the defendants can't be guaranteed. Your Honor, this is a ploy by the defendants. It's obvious. All we're asking is to postpone the start of the trial. Indefinitely. - Until the conditions are right. - Indefinitely. It's the first day! You can't adjourn on the first day! If you adjourn today, if there's no trial, this will never happen! All they need is to have a bomb threat a day. Strassera, can you shut up? We will continue. - What? - Yes. We will proceed as usual. This court guarantees the safety of the trial. The trial's happening and starts today. - What about the bomb? - Let it blow up. - You do realize this decision... - I'm very aware. You heard him. He's very aware. One more thing. The women can't wear scarves. They're the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo. Political emblems are not allowed. Of no color, type or ideology. - The court is well aware... - Anything else? No, Your Honor. - Secretary, prepare the hearing. - Yes, sir. If you may. Excuse me for bothering you. I don't need to explain the importance of the trial, even less to you. There's a lunatic trying to stop it... unless you remove your scarves. It's a difficult decision, I know. It's not our choice to make, but yours. I'm sorry. - I beg you pardon. - Yes, yes. - What should we do? - Let's do it. Don't worry. I hereby declare the proceedings open for the trial of case 13/1984, pertaining the following officers of the Armed Forces. Lieutenant General Jorge Rafael Videla, Admiral Emilio Eduardo Massera, Brigadier General Orlando Ramón Agosti, Lieutenant General Roberto... - Are you okay? - Yes. Don't be afraid. There really is no bomb. - I know. I know. - Okay. Lieutenant General Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri, Admiral Jorge Isaac Anaya, Brigadier General Arturo Basilio Ignacio Lami Dozo. We now call to the stand Dr. Ítalo Argentino Lúder. Dr. Lúder, your testimony will be taken under oath. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? I do. You may sit. Dr. Lúder, during the time in which you were president of the executive branch, these decrees were issued. 2770, 2771... - The guy I told you about is there. - And 2772. The question is the following. What were the arguments that led to those decrees? In February, 1975... for the intervention of the Argentinian Military in the fight against subversion. I extended the intervention of the Armed Forces to the whole country. We should highlight that the annihilation order was issued during the democratic government of María Estela Martínez de Perón, requesting the help of the Armed Forces, since we were on the verge of a civil war. - Right, sir? - I never said "civil war." How would you define it, then? I never talked about a war. But it's clear there was an enemy compromising national security. - Right? You just said so, Dr. Lúder. - Yes, that's true. Let the witness explain his understanding of this word so important to the defense, "annihilating." Does it mean to obtain information at any cost? Torturing, kidnapping, and physically eliminating a helpless individual? You shall answer. In no way does it mean a physical annihilation. The decrees in no way imply repression outside of the law. The witness acknowledges the enemy existed and had to be annihilated. April 23rd This slide shows a skull with a hole in its frontal area. A circular hole that corresponds to the bullet that penetrated the head. TRIAL OF THE JUNTAS FOREIGN WITNESSES Among foreign envoys, Antoine Sanguinetti stated that, during his visit to our country in 1978, APRIL, 25TH he gathered numerous complaints of the families... and international organizations regarding the alleged disappearances? Luis. APRIL 26TH The complaints presented by the UN and Amnesty International. Nor by the Human Rights organizations, OAS, or United Nations, against the government... Your Honor, the prosecution has the numerous reports and complaints that have been received, which is clear evidence that the witness is committing perjury. Mr. Strassera, wait for your turn, please. Proceed, Vice Admiral. I have no knowledge of what you mentioned. As I was saying, these were general questions about Argentina's political situation. So? What? - How are we doing? - I'd say we're doing well. What are your doubts? I didn't say anything. I said we're good. What are you thinking? - Nothing. - Nothing good, you mean. What do you want me to say, Julio? - Why aren't we doing well? - I didn't say that. But you think that. - We're doing well. - But? I spoke to my mom. - What did she say? - Nothing. - Nothing. The usual. - What's the usual? The usual, Julio. She thinks foreign experts are like the subversives. - The anti-Argentina campaign. - Luis. We can't take your mom as a parameter. She went to church with Videla. - We'll never convince her. - No, right. If convincing her is our mission, we're screwed. We'll never do it. - Never. - You think we can? We can't. We'll never convince people like your mom. - Never. - Okay, Julio. Okay. You're right. You're so stubborn. I can't argue with you. - Julio. - What? - I need you. - For what? Tomorrow's testimony. - Now? - Yes. Okay. There's a waiting room. APRIL 29TH - Can she stay with me? - No. Witnesses only. - You must stay until the deposition. - In isolation? You can't talk to anyone. So alone? The court established that you can't see anyone. - Here. - Will you cover my face too? It's for your safety. Sure, thanks. I've been getting threats for a month. - And your security detail? - A man came one day, and then disappeared. It's best to keep away from the police. - And her? - She stays with me. All day. Don't worry. The court calls Mrs. Adriana Calvo de Laborde. Ma'am, the present court will receive your testimony in the process against the commanders of the military Juntas in the so-called "Process of National Reorganization." Your testimony... On February 4th, 1977, I was abducted from my home. They put me in a car. As the car turned around the corner, they put a sweater over my head, threw me on the car's floor, and stepped on me. Then, they started threatening to kill me. They took me out, took the sweater, they blindfolded me tightly with a rag, and cuffed my hands on my back. At the time, I was six and a half months pregnant, so quite into my pregnancy. They tortured me, in spite of my condition. They had me locked up for months. The tortures were systematic, constant, of all kind... The court calls Mrs. María Kubik. Good evening, Juan Carlos. On the seventh day of the trial to the former commanders, the court opened with Kubik's heartbreaking testimony, mother of the disappeared María Cristina Lefteroff. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? I do. María Cristina Lefteroff was kidnapped and taken to Quilmes Brigade. Hours later, the mother, wanting to find her daughter, was also kidnapped and taken to a secret detention center. And my brothers were 13, 11, 10, and the youngest, 8. We were forced to get off the plane, and were taken through the airport, to a vehicle, where they covered our faces. MAY 9TH We were told our mother would be sent to Tucumán. She's still missing. Did you learn about what happened to your son? I left determined to do whatever, go to Campo de Mayo, wherever. And a friend told me, "Iris, don't look for him, they killed him." In a hallway, along with other people, including my wife, who was tortured in front of me, and I could hear all of her painful screams. No one knew anything. "Why are they taking her? Where?" This is the case of someone I didn't know. Someone who was tortured for days. The gang tortured him day and night, mercilessly, with all the methods I've explained, and many more. When the gang left, Your Honor, the guards started a barbecue. Started drinking wine and getting drunk. One had the idea to torture him, and they started torturing him again. This time, they weren't after any information, Your Honor. The only purpose of this torture that lasted for hours... was for this prisoner to say, "I eat dick and my mother is a bitch." They tortured him for hours trying to make him say it. And he didn't say it, Your Honor. He didn't say it. I'm sorry to have said it, but I think it's important, because they mentioned excessive actions, and supposedly, for the defendants, these are the excessive actions. The rest is fine. Just regular cold and cruel torture. Please, describe facts without judgements. This is a fact, Your Honor. Once I asked a guard that was a bit more humane, to let me talk to her. He takes me, puts me in Claudia's cell, I take my blindfold off... Claudia says, "Pablo, thanks for the strength you give me." MAY 20TH I had told her that when we got out, we'd start a relationship. A couple, you could say. Then, at a certain point, she tells me, "Don't touch me, because I've been raped." "When they were torturing me, they turned me over," "and raped me from the front and the back." The court calls Alejandra Naftal. I was taken to another place and the girls knew I was raped. They told me they were raped too, repeatedly. It wasn't hard for some people there to take advantage of us, women, in that brutal way. An intention to psychologically destroy the person. The first day they tortured me, the day I was kidnapped, and this made me feel horrible, there was a woman pouring mate for them, as if it were an everyday thing. JUNE 21ST We'll report this and escort you to a new hotel. I'm going back, sir. We've been followed for months. - Your deposition is very important. - I won't testify. Zelaya, let's sit down. Calm down. You have to testify. People need to know. Or you'll miss the chance to have the country hear what those criminals did... Those criminals? One of the torturers works for the mayor. The doctor who checked if I could handle more shocks is chief doctor at a hospital. I have to live among them. What am I doing here? Zelaya, we can request security. We can protect you. No, we can't. That's the truth. While these guys are free, we can't protect anyone. Sad but true. News today is that, as requested by the witnesses, the prosecution's office stopped releasing the daily list of witnesses. This, in view of the repeated threats suffered by the witnesses who testify every day. JULY 17TH Hello? A Tricolor Command member told someone in the prosecution that in less than 48 hours... - Who? - the prosecutor would die. PROSECUTOR THREATENED We've also been threatened. The prosecution should file a formal report, - or provide more details... - Details? Judith, come, please. Could you please give any information to the call you received earlier? He called before noon, said he was part of Tricolor Command. There's no such Command. Could you be more specific? A name? Any traits? Of course, since it was an anonymous call, I can't provide any names or physical traits. What was his voice like? It was a strange and rough voice. A bit ridiculous. - Like a fascist's voice. - A fascist's? What do you mean? Like yours, Mr. Counselor. - This is an absolute lack of respect. - Enough. Let's end this recess and continue with the hearings. Either the military... the defendant's aggressive strategy is repeated over and over. For the witness to say he had... JULY 20TH STOP THIS SHIT! The bomb forced them to double the security in the trial, due to repeated threats to President Alfonsín and Prosecutor Strassera. When they released my siblings and me, they told us not to take our blindfolds, that they'd be watching. We spent 15 minutes like that on the street. My siblings cried, asked for my mother. I saw a restaurant across the street. It was full. People were watching. No one helped us. How can someone believe a group of kids could be dangerous? I went into labor on April 15th. It was my third child, I knew it'd be quick. A patrol came, they got me in, and we left the fifth precinct. I was blindfolded and lying down in the car. My hands tied behind my back. They insulted me. I told them my baby was coming, told them to stop, that this wasn't my first, it was time. They didn't do anything. The driver and the other guy kept laughing. They told me it made no difference, because... they were going to kill me and the baby. I shouldn't care. I don't know how I managed to take off my underwear to push the baby out. I don't remember. I screamed, "It's coming, I can't hold it in. Stop!" And, indeed, my baby girl was born. They stopped on the side of the road. My baby was healthy. She was very small. She fell off the seat, was hanging from the umbilical cord on the floor. I begged for them to give her to me, to let me hold her, but they didn't. They tied the cord and kept driving. Three minutes later, my baby was crying. I was still tied down and blindfolded. They wouldn't give her to me. We got to another place, a large building with marble countertops. They put my baby on a countertop. She was cold, dirty, crying. They made me go in, brought a bucket, and made me mop the floor, and clean all countertops. I had to do that, naked, in front of the officer. In front of the guards, who were laughing. Only after that, I could hold my baby. The night before my release, Claudia said one thing that I'll never forget. Every December 31st, on New Year's Eve, I should raise a glass for her and everyone else. Because she was already dead. Would you like to add anything else? Your Honor, all I want to know is if my daughter is dead or alive. Unfortunately, this court cannot answer that. A month later, I was released. We lost our jobs, we lost our home, we lost our friends, we lost everything. We had to flee the country. They managed to terrorize me, Your Honor. Luckily, they didn't terrorize everyone. There were relatives, mothers and grandmothers who faced them. And I'm here today, demanding justice, thanks to them. I have nothing else to add. Prosecutor, any questions? No questions, Your Honor. Will the defense ask any questions? No questions. Your deposition is over, ma'am. Thank you. I'm already gone. Hello? Yes, I'll put you through. They have to be there. - Luis. - Look. - It's your mom. - Thanks. Let's see. Hello? I'm okay, Mom. Thanks. We had a good hearing today. You heard it on the radio? Of course I knew, I didn't know you were listening. Really? What do you think? Adriana Calvo de Laborde. Did she tell the truth? Of course she did. How can someone be so cruel? Being so cruel to a pregnant woman? Not even caring about a baby. Dreadful, honestly. Dreadful. I never thought I would hear something... so dreadful. Me neither. I know I said ugly things, and that we argue a lot. It's not easy for me to see my son do something I strongly disagree with. - Well... - That's what I always thought. Because of my education, religion, the people I know... I always respected the army, but now... Now I think you're right. - You think I'm right? - Yes, Luis, you're right. Videla should go to prison. - Luis. - Yes, Mom. He should go to prison. I don't know how many people are hearing the trial. Yes, everybody should listen to it. Yes, we're working now. We're preparing tomorrow's hearing. It's clear the forces are interconnected. The Bettini case. All the crimes in a single family. They murder the son, kidnap the father, then mess with the grandmother. Relax, we're doing well. - What's the matter? - I don't like you saying that. - That we're well? - I don't like that. Why? You're doing well, but if you think you're doing well, it can all go to shit, understand? - I'm just trying to stay positive. - You must be sharper than ever. It's true, up to now, you've managed... to get attention. You got emotion. Yes, sure. Hey, are you okay? Hey, are you okay or not? - Answer me. - No! - Are you okay? - No, but neither are you! It's the ESMA's turn. The ESMA is tough. I know. I know. You know. Be careful, Julio. Be careful. - Mom? - Yes. There's a letter here. From the Argentinian Navy. With a bullet. Give it to me. Someone left it here. MR. STRASSERA WE WILL EXECUTE YOU IN 48 HOURS Two weeks, that's all. - You said one. - Vero, it doesn't matter. I'm not scared. The ones who kill don't threaten. It's a known fact. They broke into our home, and the hearing's in an hour. Please, I beg you. - It's the most important day. - Okay. I just don't want anything to happen to you. Two weeks, until we're done with the ESMA. That's all! - Until we're done with the ESMA. - Okay. - Let's go, kids. Quickly. - Good. Good. Until you're done with the ESMA. Sir. Sir. The media is talking about a new threat. That you received a letter in your residence. It's a meaningless thing. I believe they're trying to intimidate witnesses more than me. And it's very clumsy. If they did something to me, I will always have a replacement. So you believe the threats. Have you reported this? It's being investigated accordingly. Our sources say it was a letter by the Argentinian Navy. Is it true? It's time for the hearing. Thank you for your concern. That was Prosecutor Julio Strassera. Today, he faces the hardest moment of the trial to the former commanders. All you contributed is very important. No doubt about that. The risks you took, the evidence you brought. You're a hero. But your situation is different. - The defense will... - Why is it different? Let me be clear, we're trying to help you. - I'm trying... - I don't understand why I'm different. You know what? They'll try to prove you weren't a victim, but an employee at the ESMA. But it's the truth. I worked for them because they made me. - Yes, we know. - Not only the truth matters. - It's about risks. - I've already taken risks. I risked myself gathering all these for the trial. Look, sir, I was tortured, kidnapped... They forced me to rat out my comrades. Some may have disappeared because of me. No, no. I'm a victim, and I must be heard. Let the witness answer if that compensation he just described could be considered as a reward for his work at the ESMA. Sir, I was forced to work there. I was forced to use my knowledge for a task I knew to be illegal. - That is, the forgery of IDs. - I understand. I told you he would crush him. At the ESMA, they were forced to do tasks. Your Honor. The evidence shared by the witness is eloquent enough to put a stop to this incredible harassment the defense is undertaking to prove if he was a slave or not. The defense has the right to ask the questions it deems necessary. The court will decide if they're appropriate or not. - That's what I'm saying. - Mr. Prosecutor, please. Thank you, Your Honor. Answer then. Did you exit and enter in a similar manner to the rest of the staff? Such as NCOs or troops? Once I got the pass, it was quite similar. Therefore, it's proven that the structure of entries and exits had the same manners as the rest of the staff. They made him look like a suspect. If you heard the trial today, it's like the ESMA was a club, where detainees were strolling around. Look, Luis. If I had to cry over every testimony that gets complicated, for every question from the judges... Or the defendants' pressure, I'd have to retire, change jobs. - Because that's exactly their job. - And ours is to win the trial, Julio! To win it in the closing arguments, at the sentencing, in the streets. Which street? Lavalle or Paraná? - Don't patronize me. - What happened? - Listen. - Try to understand the limits of our job. The witnesses are heroes. We must take care of them. We are officials of the judiciary. Officials. We don't get involved with witnesses or judges. Or let anyone pressure us. Is that clear? Officials. You know that some officials washed their hands, and played dumb during the dictatorship! Who played dumb, for instance? You know what I mean. No, I don't. Care to explain? - Being an official means nothing if... - Don't beat around the bush. What are you talking about? About taking risks being an official, and not being condescending. I don't take risks? I am condescending? - I'm not talking about you. - You just said I am. That I'm useful to the reigning power, and played dumb during the dictatorship. No! This is something else. You're about to rub in my face the disappearances I couldn't investigate. I mean something else, Strassera. No, you're not. I know what you're talking about. What do you think we did during the dictatorship? Make shitloads of money? Party in Punta del Este? Enjoy the privileges of being part of a noble family? With a colonel uncle? And a mother who went to church with Videla? I can't answer for my family. But I can for myself. Fuck you, Moreno Ocampo. - Fuck you, Strassera! - Fine. I can also answer for myself. Hello? Strassera, yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Tomorrow. Okay. Agreed. Bruzzo. - What? - I don't know. I don't know. Julio. Sorry. - First thing is congratulations. - Thanks. What you did has brought hope to many. Sit. Not just me, everyone's proud of the work you're doing. Thank you. The president himself said it was an example, something historical. I appreciate it. Why have you called me? Coffee? A nice, warm cup of coffee? What is Secretary Tróccoli asking for? Well... I'm worried about something, and you have to help me. Help you? Yes, it's delicate. There's heavy unrest in the forces. They think this is the beginning, and the trials will go on. We must be responsible. - Justice must be responsible. - Responsible? On whose behalf are you telling me this? On behalf of the country, Julio. The country. If there's a military uprising, and you know very well it can happen, who will count the dead? You, me? The judges? Julio. Julio. Julio. I can't believe this. What are you doing here, Luis? - Can you tell me exactly what Bruzzo said? - I'm in the toilet. Maybe you're assuming he said something, but no. Please. Please, tell me what Bruzzo said! I repeated it three times. He... He asked us to be careful... with our conviction requests. C-A-R-E-F-U-L. What does it mean? For instance, I've just wiped my ass, carefully. Unbelievable. You're not okay. And what did you tell him? I told him that... he would learn about the conviction requests at the closing argument. - That the judiciary is independent. - What did he say? He said... If the judiciary doesn't act right, it could be worse for democracy. The Air Force must come out clean. - He told you that? - Give or take a word. - Wait, how so? Did he say "Air Force"? - No, he didn't, but he implied it. So "careful" and "Air Force" weren't in the same sentence? Trust me, Luis. We're on our own. Alone. Can't you see? We tried. Let's go. - Thanks. - Go, Julio. Look at those Air Force fuckers. They laugh on our faces. Assholes! All right. Julio! Julio! Julio, stop! Mr. Secretary. - Stop! - Could you request the prosecutor to refrain from making insulting gestures to the defense? - Please. - Julio! Julio! Mr. Strassera, please strictly abide by the code of procedures. Can you calm down? Easy. I am calm. - Doesn't look like it. - I'll calm down. All rise. Tiempo Nuevo. Mr. Gonzaga, Defense Attorney to Admiral Massera. What would you tell someone who is following the trial, and who hears on a daily basis that Admiral Massera is a murderer? I'd tell them to think about how Argentina was 10 years ago. The Argentina of guerrillas and Isabel. I'd ask that person, what if the admiral had lost the war? Where would President Alfonsín be? And the judges? In jail, or executed. No, no. - Why? - Because no. - That's not enough. - How come? I'm saying no. At least give me a reason. He was the dictatorship's minister of propaganda. That enough now? - Okay. - It's important... You're a big boy, do as you wish. - We have to explain... - Okay, okay. Bye. We have to... What? Moreno Ocampo wants me on TV. On Neustadt's show. What did you say? No. I'd never do it. He can do whatever he wants. - Hello? - They'd destroy you. That's what they do. Yes. What? Should I explain to him again? 20 times? Yes. - It's his choice. - Dad. - The phone. - No. - No, it's not Moreno Ocampo. - Who is it? Do you know where we're going? It's not my place to know. But you do know. Fine. - Thank you. - Counselor. How are you? Apologies for the inconvenience, but this couldn't be done in the president's office. I understand. - I'll let the president know. - Yes, sure. - The prosecutor's here. - Have him come in. Please. The man of the hour. You look exhausted. - Julio. - Good evening, Mr. President. You know what's being done is very important for the Argentinian justice. Yes, thank you. We're very proud. It lasted 15 minutes or less. - And Bruzzo was there. - Yes, but he didn't speak. Why was he there, then? I really don't know. To show unity with the president? Maybe Tróccoli asked him. - And what did the president say? - He told me that... he was up to date with the testimonies. That he was moved. And that... he met some witnesses. He did all the talking. You didn't say anything? I did. I asked... - what he expected from the trial. - Good. That's good. Good. What did he say? That's when he said, "I have no indications for you." That's it. That's strange, right? Nothing else? Something. He must have said something else. Well, yes. Yes. He said something as I left. There it is. What did he say? He said, "Looking forward to hearing your closing argument." - He said that? - Yes. Okay, it's crystal clear. What? Separation of powers. It's perfect. Julio, you'll have to write a great closing argument. One hell of a closing argument. And it needs to be striking, because evidently a lot depends on it. Maybe everything depends on it. Okay, I get it. Don't make me even more nervous. Julio. I'll tell you something I've never said before. And the fact I never told you this says a lot. - And I want to tell you now. - Come on, Silvia. I'm proud of you. You know what it is? I always thought I was married to... a grumpy non-believer, and now you're a national hero. - Who says that? - It doesn't matter. You're a national hero. Leave the nation out of it. Well, as you wish. And heroes don't exist, Silvia. Perhaps they do, Julio. Perhaps... - Okay. - This will dull the shine. Coming, coming. Let's go. On air in three, two, one. Luis Moreno Ocampo, tell me. Do you hate the military? No, not at all. I respect the institution. - Doesn't look like it. - That's a shame. I feel part of the military family. You don't say. Do you know you're hated by most of the military? Well, I don't know if most. Some of them don't like what we're doing, but I deem others do. Do you think there are some who do? Let me ask you something, Bernardo. Do you know who Francisco Ortiz de Ocampo was? - A relative of yours? - My great-great grandfather. The first general commander in Argentinian history. The very first one. Do you think I could be against the military institution? The thing is I'm a lawyer. Law is my obsession. I can't allow those who break it to get away with it. What Mr. Strassera and I want, besides justice for the victims, is to end the use of death as a political tool. Isn't that what everyone wants? - Yes. Of course. - This is about what the country needs. Respect and justice. "The Argentinian society and the law have entrusted us the mission "to come to you to claim for justice. "At the same time, "it's impossible to talk about the thousands of cases," "and the chosen cases cannot represent the magnitude of..." - The genocide. - Genocide, yes. What do you think? Tell me. I'm listening carefully to the innocuous prose of a court clerk. Picturing thousands of people yawning in Argentina and the world, while listening to you live. This is not a play, Somigliana. Neither a case file, Strassera! Calm down, you two. - Yes, let's calm down. - Okay. What Julio started saying is good. Sure, it's formal, but solid. Right? - Start by talking about the violence. - Yes, the violence. No. About the history of violence in Argentina. And then, the reaction of the military government. - A vicious response. - Yes. Clandestine. - And cowardly. - Yes, cowardly. - I love it. - Me too. - Go. - A vicious response... Look. Tell me. Give me. The only ones capable of authorizing the detention of a person first, by the Army, then taken to a Navy secret center and transferred on an Air Force aircraft were the Military Juntas. "Official reports were replaced by accusations. "Questionings by torture, and reasoned sentencing with the... "Neronian gesture"? Yes, what? - Neronian gesture? - Emperor Nero. As in thumbs down. Okay. - But it's not clear. - No? What about... "The Neronian thumbs-down gesture?" No? - Yes. - Here you go. Go on. Let me see. "Now that the Argentinian people has recovered the government, "and control of its institutions, "I take responsibility to declare in its name "that sadism is not a political ideology," "nor a war strategy, but a moral perversion." - "Moral perversion"? - "Moral perversion." No? - Did we go off the rails? - Impeccable. - Yes? - Yes. Good evening. - The celebrity's here! - You are... - May I? - Sure, Mr. Fame. What do you think? Sorry. What's this? To dull the shine, they said. They didn't achieve it. You did shine. Right? Today, the trial enters a crucial stage. Prosecutor Julio Cesar Strassera will issue in the presence of the nine former commanders the argument where he will substantiate the charges of homicide and other serious crimes of which the former Juntas are accused of. Specialized media... SEPTEMBER 18TH, 1985 THE CLOSING ARGUMENT Bring the defendants in. All rise. You may sit. The hearing is declared reopened for the prosecutor to present his closing arguments. We inform the parties that, during the argument, this court shall admit no interruptions nor interventions other than by the person speaking. Furthermore, it is suggested to all attendants to strictly abide by the rules of behavior, timely established by this court and duly informed. Mr. Strassera, the prosecution has the floor. Please. Your Honors, the Argentinian community, but also the universal juridical conscience, have entrusted me with the dignified mission of standing before this court to demand justice. Technical and factual reasons, such as the absence of a specific definition in domestic law that could accurately describe the type of crime that is on trial today, and the impossibility to consider the thousands of cases one by one, have led me to exhibit through 17 dramatic weeks of hearings, only 709 cases that, by the way, do not cover... the chilling number of victims caused by what we could describe as the greatest genocide in our country's young history. Violence ruled throughout the country, when three of the defendants decided, once again, on behalf of the Armed Forces, to take the government by force, paying no heed to the people's will. And what was the state's response after this coup, to the subversive guerrilla? To describe it, Your Honors, I only need three words. Vicious, clandestine and cowardly. The guerrillas kidnapped and killed. And what did the state do to fight them? Kidnap, torture and kill on an infinitely larger scale. And, what is even worse, outside of any legal system. And from then onwards, Your Honors, much more serious consequences emerged. How many victims of the repression were guilty of illegal activities? How many were innocent? We'll never know, and that's not the victims' fault. When due process was eliminated, a true juridical subversion occurred. Official reports were replaced by accusations. Questioning, by torture. And sentence reasoned by the Neronian thumbs-down gesture. Among the many debts this coward system has incurred with the Argentinian society, there is one... which cannot be repaid. I'd like to repeat that. The lack of judicial sentence is not the omission of a formality. It's a vital issue concerning the dignity of humankind. For instance, its abandonment led to the following. A person was kidnapped for being part of the PAF. Peronist Armed Forces. But they belonged to the AFP, Argentinian Federation of Psychiatrists. Does anyone have the right to let Adriana Calvo de Laborde give birth in cuffs, blindfolded, in the back seat of a patrol car, lying on the floor, and not being able... to hold her baby? "We will not tolerate death roaming free in Argentina. "Slowly, so that we wouldn't notice, "a machinery of horror unleashed its iniquity over the unaware" "and the innocent." This was the statement of Admiral Emilio Eduardo Massera on November 2nd, 1976, at the Navy School of Mechanics. Right then, in the ESMA officer's quarters, Cecilia Inés Cacabelos was lying on a mat. She was 16 years old. She had been blindfolded, her hands tied and cuffed. She had been captured thanks to the information provided by her sister, who was assured they would just interrogate her. She thought she was saving her life. Cecilia Inés Cacabelos is, still today, disappeared. But let us now adopt the theory of war that the defendants like so much. Can we consider the kidnapping of defenseless at the break of dawn by anonymous gangs an act of war? Is it an act of war to torture and kill them, when they couldn't put up resistance? Is it an act of war to occupy homes and hold relatives as hostages? Are newborn babies... military targets? This process has meant, for those who've had the painful privilege of knowing it deeply a sort of descent to dark areas of the human soul, where misery, abjection and horror reach depths hard to imagine in advance, and to understand afterwards. Dante Alighieri, in The Divine Comedy, saved the seventh circle of hell for the violent ones. For all of those who hurt others through the use of force. And in that same hell, he submerged in a river of boiling and nauseating blood, a specific type of doomed, which the poet described as follows, "Tyrants are these who dealt in bloodshed and pillaging." "Here, they lament their pitiless mischiefs." For all this, Your Honor, this trial and its conviction are important and necessary for the Argentinian Nation, which has been offended by atrocious crimes. Their very atrocity turns the hypothesis of impunity into a monstruous one. Unless the moral sense of the Argentinians has descended to tribal levels, nobody can allow that kidnapping, torture and murder become political incidents. Or "collateral damage in combat." Now that the Argentinian people have recovered the government and control of its institutions, I take the responsibility of stating on its behalf that sadism is neither a political ideology, nor a war strategy, but a moral perversion. This trial and the sentence I am advocating for, we're responsible for setting a peace based not in oblivion, but in memory. Not in violence, but in justice. This is our opportunity. It might be the last one. Your Honors, I wish to waive any claim to originality in concluding this argument. I want to use... a quote that doesn't belong to me, because it already belongs to the entire Argentinian people. Your Honors, "Never Again." Excellent. Well done, Julio. Quiet in the courtroom. Motherfuckers! You bunch of motherfuckers! DECEMBER 8TH, 1985 THE SENTENCE THE SENTENCE Good afternoon. No, sir, no news yet. As soon as we do, we'll let you know. Any news? Nothing. I have news. - I ran into them. - The judges? Yes. They're at a pizza place. - What? You followed them? - Yes. - So? - So what? - What's the news? - I was outside, I couldn't hear. But you saw something. Were they happy, worried? - Could you be more specific? - Okay. Okay, they got there at 2:00 p.m. They sat down. Mustache and Dark Hair in the ends. Young and Glasses on one side, facing Short and Skinny. They ordered beer, a pint each. Except Mustache, who ordered wine. Maybe it was a soft drink. They got two pizzas. Onion and chorizo. Okay, not that specific. - You told me to. - Get to the point. Fine. Suddenly, Young has an idea. Everyone listened. At first, Mustache kept shaking his head. When he stopped, he lit a cigarette and listened with a serious look on his face. Glasses looked at him. At one point, he winked at him. So, Dark Hair wrote something on a napkin. Signed it, passed it to everyone, and they all signed. The convictions are there. On a napkin. That's all. Glasses said something that they felt was important, put the napkin away, and I left. - You left? - Yeah, I left. - To judge what must be judged. - Okay. Trials should go on... - I'll be right back. - Tell me how. Strassera Jr., why are you here? - Just buying something. - Want a lollipop? Okay. Two of these and a lollipop for the kid. Spies don't eat lollipops. Hear me out. I have relevant last minute information. - They reached an agreement. - On a napkin. - They signed. - He told us. You already knew. - To sum up, we know nothing. - We do. - They made a decision. - And the sentences? I don't know. Hello? Yes, it's me. The nation wants to know this. What do you think the sentence will be? This trial cannot become a theater play. The witnesses can't be afraid to testify. Please, cough. Okay, good. You'll have to spend the night here. Look who came to visit. The national hero. - Sorry I can't stand up. - You look good. As good as new. It's the morphine. You have no idea... what we've been missing out all these years. - What? - Go on, tell me. - Did you come to give your condolences? - I don't know what you mean. Come on. The sentences. Come on, cheer me up a little. I just came from there. I don't know them yet. Listen, I might die tonight. I can't tell anyone. Come on. Okay, what do you want to know? Everything. Did we win or not? Yes, we won. Everyone in jail? Right? Life sentences for all of them? Life for all of them. - Air Force too? - Air Force too. Of course! Who could possibly think they were killing half the country, and they didn't have a clue? - Right? - Yes, it's ridiculous. Hold my hand. Thank you, man. Thank you. TRIAL OF THE JUNTAS WE'LL KNOW THE SENTENCES IN A FEW HOURS - How are you? - Fine. Here. You pick it up. Hello? Yes. - No, no, he's up. - Who is it? Really? Really? I'll put him through. The convictions are out. Hello. I have information on the sentences. Okay, tell me. Do not to interrupt me until I've finished. I'll read them. - There's nothing else to say! - Julio, let's wait for the argument. What for? I know what they'll say. - You don't know. - I know. - There must be a reason. - There is no reason! I swear. The evidence is there. All together. They saw it and read it. There's no way they interpreted something different. I don't know. Let's wait. - Hey, Dad. - Hi, son. How did it go? Badly, son. Badly. - How come badly? - Badly. Badly means badly. - Are you being serious? - Yes. What happened? Graffigna, Anaya, Lami Dozo and Galtieri acquitted. - Acquitted? - You heard me. And the rest? Agosti, four years and six months. It's the same. Lambruschini, eight. And Viola? - Viola, 17 years. - 17? That old man won't last 17 years. Massera? - Life sentence. - Life sentence? Perfect, Dad! - And Videla? - Life. - You sent Videla to jail? - Yes. - For life? - That's a life sentence. - And Massera too? - Yes. That's awesome, Dad! Yes. Can't you do anything with the others? Yes. - We can appeal. - You have to put them all in jail! Mom! Vero! He put Videla in jail! - Julio? - What? What are you doing? Go to sleep. No, I have work to do. COMPLYING WITH THE LEGAL DUTY... APPEAL THE RULING... The Trial of the Juntas was the first time in history that civil justice convicted a military dictatorship. Despite the impunity acts that followed the 1985 trial, the claim for memory, truth and justice never stopped. Since the reopening of the Trials, over 1,000 people have been convicted for crimes against humanity, and thousands of cases are still being tried. Since 1983, Argentina has lived uninterruptedly in a democracy.
