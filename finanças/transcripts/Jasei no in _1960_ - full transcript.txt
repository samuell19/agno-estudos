When was it? This happened when a monk was still young and travelling around the country. The story starts when a young man called Minokichi... from the village of Hida, walked the trail of this mountain. Hey! Hey! Hey! Forgive me! Help! Forgive me! What's wrong? Hey! You must be the village headman's daughter! What happened to your clothes? Since you can't move, I will carry you to your house. Hold on tight. I don't want to touch it! Well, it's fine now. Lady! Lady! Oh, Gen! Come with me! - Hey, go to Shobei's place. - Shobei's place? Alright! How did it go? Did you find her? She isn't at her uncle's place either. I see. Hello. What happened? The lady is missing. Oh? - Did you find her? - Well... They have searched places she visited often, including Hideko's place... the opposite side of the river and uncle Tame's place in Bunkyo... but they couldn't find her. Keep searching! Ask anyone who is available to search for her! Yes. What happened this time? Lady! Lady! Lady! Lady... Why are you deep inside the mountains? I was sleeping... but someone called me. And then... Ms. Sakurako! Ms. Kinu is here. Your husband will come soon. Please wait. Who the hell are you? What are you going to do? Help me! Anyone! When I woke up, I was in this lonely place. Somebody squeezed me hard and it was painful. It must be a snake's trick. The village headman must be worried. I will carry you to your house. Hurry! But this mountain trail is not an easy one... That's alright! I have been raised in a mountain village. This is nothing! Come on. Really? Hey, I found our lady! Lady! Lady! - I'm glad! - Hurry! - Lady! - Idiot! What are you doing? Was it you? What did you do to our lady? It's not like that, Sakuzo! No, I'll punish this bastard! He's a pervert who shouldn't live in this village! Take her home now! - Minokichi! - Lady! What, you bastard? I was just walking the mountain trail and found her. I won't let a commoner like you spoil our dignified lady's body. I'll punish you so that you'll never again try to touch her body! Bastard! What are you doing? Bastard! Bastard! You made everyone worried! That's enough. Never ever approach our lady! Minokichi! Minokichi! Are you alright? Mother... Are you hurt? I'm fine. Don't worry. I told you about this. Did you forget? Even if you try to interact with them, they won't treat you as a equal. This is our fate. Let's go. - What happened? - Master, whose scream was that? Kinu! What happened? Lady! Minokichi. Minokichi. What's wrong, Kinu? Out of the way! Lady! Lady! Calm down! Is there anyone? Help us calm her down! Lady! Lady! This way! Come! Lady! Lady! Lady! Lady! Lady! Lady! - Lady! - Let go of me! - Take her inside! - Yes! - Hurry! - Yes! Inside! - You! - Yes! - Go fetch the doctor! - Yes! You're dead! Hey! Wanna eat this? Idiot! Throw that away! If you eat a snake, you'll get sick! I don't think so. You're just scared of it, aren't you? Ridiculous! Fine... I'll give it to Kinu. Hey! If you do that, Kinu will hate you. Come back! I guess Kinu will hate my son. No way. I don't think... I guess nobody can save my idiotic son. However, if Kinu marries my son... you will become a prefectural councilman after me. I guess Kinu can endure the hardship for that. Kinu? What are you doing? Kinu... I caught this. You're hurting the snake! You're hurting the snake! Help! - Help... - You're hurting the snake! - Help! - Hey, Kinu! What happened? What are you doing to your future husband? He is not my husband! My husband is Minokichi! What are you talking about? You are sick. Come here and sleep. If I can't marry Minokichi, I will die! Hey, Kinu! Sakuzo! Lady! Lady... Come on... Let's go back... Come on... Leave me alone! Lady... Lady... People are watching us... Lady... Poor girl... The village headman's daughter has lost her mind... I guess so. - Lady... - Minokichi! Leave me alone! - Lady... - Minokichi! Minokichi... Here! Wow, the grapes are good. Kiyo, thank you for everything. Tell your parents thank you. It's nothing. Minokichi, do you want me to help you? I'm good. Well, we can finish it soon. Thank you for saying that. Alright, visit our house tonight then. Thank you. Kiyo is a proper woman now. She will become your wife next year. You are happy, aren't you? What's wrong, Mino? Do you like the village headman's daughter? Do you? You have been weird recently. I have already told you... You are not supposed to like her. If you are found to like the headman's daughter, you will get punished. And not just you. Every commoner in our village will get punished. Understood? Commoners should marry each other. Just marry Kiyo. Alright? - Hello there. - Officer? What's the occasion? Today, I am here on behalf of the headman. I am here to ask Minokichi a favor on behalf of the headman. I see. Please come inside. Thanks. Minokichi, hurry! Hurry! The headman's daughter is extremely attracted to you and wants to marry you. But a commoner like me can't become her husband. True. Usually, it's not allowed. But the headman thinks his daughter's life is more important than anything. So, he had no other choice but to ask you to marry her. For commoners, no offer is more honorable than this. Am I right? Yes. Minokichi... I have told you that commoners can't interact with the village people... but you have to choose between living a pathetic life as a commoner... and living a proper life as the husband of the headman's daughter. I don't know whether I should approve or disapprove. This offer is good for Minokichi personally and other commoners as well. Minokichi... If you become the husband of the headman's daughter... other commoners won't get disrespected anymore. The hardship that has existed for so long will disappear forever. Maybe you are right. If you like the headman's daughter, you should marry her. Kiyo! Kiyo! I won't marry the headman's daughter. We promised to marry each other when we were kids. - You should go. - Huh? She has money and is also a cute girl. You don't have to care about me. But... If you and other commoners can become happy, I will give up. Father! What happened? Kiyo! It's already been three days, but tonight is our first time alone. Yes. I am so happy that this feels like a dream. I can't believe this. Why would a cute girl like you marry a commoner like me? Stop, don't say that. But it's true. Because of the marriage, my dream has come true. I have been your wife for a long time. Huh? Have you forgotten about Sakurako, who you pledged to love forever? - Sakurako? - Yes. So, are you Sakurako? The feelings just didn't disappear. So, I got into Kinu's body to follow you. I am Sakurako, a white snake's incarnation. Right; it was a year ago... Are you hurt? Easy, easy. Alright. My body's warmth will heal you. I never forgot the warmth of your body... and I decided to make you mine no matter what. And not long after that... We have been waiting for you. I am not a dangerous person. My name is Sakurako and I have been waiting for you. Finally, today is the day. Please come on in. Matsu, what are you looking at? Guide him inside. Yes. Please come in. Here. Please have a drink. Any hesitation will disappear. This house and my body are all yours. Minokichi... Please adore me forever. Please... Please make my dream come true. But I don't even know your real name... I am a poor girl who has no one to turn to. My background doesn't matter, does it? Please adore me until you die. Minokichi... My heart and body are all yours now. If you leave me, I will hate you. The same goes for you. Cheating on me with someone else is not allowed. No way! I love you so much. I'm leaving. Come again tonight, alright? If you are late, Matsu will come for you. Yes. Minokichi! I have to go! No way! It's a snake's trick! A snake's trick? Yes! This kind of thing happened when I was young as well. The guy died after the snake drained him of all his energy! That's ridiculous! There is a legend that the snake spirit is a scary thing. Listen! Never go to the mountain again! Get inside! Listen, Minokichi! But I... Idiot! If you keep interacting with that woman... she will kill you by draining your energy! No, I don't believe it! I don't believe it! I don't care she is a snake! I will marry her! Minokichi! I have been waiting for you. Ms. Sakurako is waiting for you. Please come in. Sakurako. Thank you for coming. I will never forget about you. I feel lonely when you are not with me. Sakurako... You monster! What are you doing to my son? Damn you! - Bitch! - Mother! Damn you! Mother! It's dangerous! You monster! Mother! It's dangerous! Bitch! - Mother! No! - Out of my way! Out of my way! I will kill it! Get out of the way! - Mother! - Let go of me! - Mother! - Let go of me! Let me go! - Let me go! - Mother! Stop it, mother! What's wrong? Mino! Let me go! Let me go! Wait! - Minokichi! - Mother! It's dangerous! Mino! Let me go! Let me go, Mino! Let me go! Mother, wait! - It's dangerous! - Mino! Wake up! Mother, wait! Let go! Let go! Sakurako! Sakurako! Come, Lady Sakurako! Quickly! - Let me go! - Wait! Sakurako! Wait... Let go! - Sakurako! - Wait! - Sakurako! - Mino! Wake up! Mino! Look at that! They're not human! They're snakes! This way! - Mother! - Look at that! You were holding the snake there! Help! Mino! I couldn't trick your mother in Sakurako's appearance. So I got into Kinu's body and became your wife. I will never leave you! I will be your wife in the future too. Master, they are such a cute couple. Right. I am glad she didn't marry the retarded son of the prefectural councilman. Anyway, I want to have a grandchild as soon as possible. Help me! She's a snake! This woman is the incarnation of a snake! Don't talk nonsense! Kinu! Hey! - Kinu! - Father! I'm not lying! Kinu is possessed by a snake! - Let go of me! - What are you doing? Let him go! Let go! - Hey, what are you doing? - Yes. Let him go! - Lady! - Anyone! Help me! - Lady! - Sakuzo! Let go! Let him go! Kinu! She's a snake! Kinu! Kinu! Kinu! Sakuzo! Pull! Everyone! - Kinu! - Lady! Lady! Kinu! Let go! Let go! Lady! Let me go! Lady! Minokichi! Minokichi! Lady! Calm down! As her husband said, she is possessed by a snake. That's ridiculous! - But... - Master... Let's have a shrine maiden from the Mizuname Shrine check her first. She will tell us whether she is actually possessed by a snake. It's a white snake! She is possessed by a white snake. I heard that white snakes desire men during the full moon. God's creation is scary. I have heard about many monsters, but I have never heard about a white snake. Apparently, Kinu was raped by a white snake in the mountains. It wasn't in the mountains. The husband ran away from the mountains, but the snake followed him. The snake snuck into Kinu's bed and possessed her. In that case, somebody has to sleep with Kinu to confirm... whether she is actually possessed by a snake. Alright! You do it! Ridiculous! My wife keeps me busy! That's it! How about the horny doctor? - That weirdo? - Yes! Sorry for being horny. Let me go! Minokichi! Minokichi! Help! Let me go! We have to follow the master's orders. Don't take it personally. Open up! Help! Minokichi! Minokichi! Minokichi! Minokichi! Minokichi! How is Kinu? She isn't getting better. I think she is really possessed by a snake. Don't worry too much. I can fix her right away. Really? Yes, of course. A human being possessed by a snake? That's ridiculous. You don't have to worry about it. Just don't. I think her marriage just made her horny. Really? Then I'm relieved. Alright... I will check her. Don't let anyone come in. Don't do that, doctor! You surprised me! Don't do that, doctor! Hey! Open the storage. Yes. Kinu... Mino! No! You aren't Mino! Unfortunately, I'm not Minokichi. No! I only want Mino! Do you really like Minokichi that much? Fine. I will let you meet Minokichi. What are you looking at? - Leave now! - Yes! Are you really going to let me meet Mino? Yes, I am! I don't lie. I will do it for you. No! Don't! Quiet! Just listen to me. So, you can do it, right? What are you doing? - Let go of me! Let go! - Quiet! Quiet! I only want Minokichi! No! I am going to fix your sickness. Kinu! You can do it, right? - Let go of me! - It's alright! Kinu... No! What are you doing? Be a good girl! Be a good girl! No! How is it? I am gentler than Minokichi, am I not? Now you desire me more than Minokichi... and will never forget about me. What are you doing? Help! Emergency! Emergency! What happened? Dr. Murai got killed by our lady. Killed? Kinu... Why did he die? Move aside! Officer, something serious happened. The doctor must have raped Kinu. Huh? I don't care what the doctor said! I know the truth. So, what should we do? The snake will kill any guy who rapes her... if he is not the guy she is attracted to. So he was... killed by her. Let's run away. Minokichi! What's wrong? I can't. I don't want to leave her. What? I just don't want to leave Kinu. Did you fall in love with that snake? Mother... I will stay here. Kinu will get better sooner or later. Idiot! If you stay here, you will get killed too! Hurry! This way! Come! Hurry! Come! There is no evidence showing that she intended to kill him with a deadly weapon. It's hard to determine the cause of death. The police consider it a heart attack. Don't worry. It's definitely not your daughter's fault. She said she strangled him. That's ridiculous! Murai died of a heart attack. Thank you, officer. Hurry! Hurry! - Hurry! - Wait! Mother! Hurry! Mother... It was very short, but I enjoyed a happiness that I will never experience again. Idiot! Nothing is more important than life! - Hurry! - Wait! Kinu... Minokichi... You have to stop thinking about it. You can't wait here forever. Lady Sakurako! Lady Sakurako! Matsu. Lady Sakurako! I can't open this door, but I can save you. - Really? - Yes. I will use my tricks to confuse the villagers. They will try to move you. I will bring Minokichi here. Just run away with him into the mountains. Thank you. Please do it for me. Yes. It's interesting that everyone sees the white snake's face. My mom got sick too. What? Maybe it's the white snake's curse! We have to ask Kinu. Right! This is because the headman's daughter is possessed by a white snake. Hey, everyone! Hurry! Let's go! Once you leave us, you are not supposed to come back to live with us. Listen. It might sound too harsh... but this strict rule has been kept since our ancestors' generations. Minokichi was just tricked by a white snake. In other words, it was an accident. Can you allow him to live here again? I don't care what the reason is. He left us. I will never allow him to live here again! Kiyo! Minokichi! Did you really run away from the headman's daughter? Do you really not love her? I have been waiting for you. I knew you would definitely come back to me. It was hard. Sorry, Kiyo. Forgive me. I won't go anywhere anymore. Promise! Promise! Minokichi! Don't go! If you do, you'll get killed. You are being tricked by the snake. Let me go! Let me go! No, I won't! I won't! I am going to protect you! Let's go back! No! No! Minokichi! Minokichi! Minokichi! Hurry, let's go to Sakurako's place. Kiyo... What's wrong? Minokichi is... Huh? Minokichi? Kiyo! Minokichi is being tricked by the snake. I have to do something or he'll be killed. Let's find him together. Yes. Minokichi went that way. Brewery We can't help it anymore. Please move her before the curse gets stronger. - I said I can't do it! - What? You can't run this business without us! He's right. Moving her will save everyone in the village! No way! She is my precious daughter! I will never move her! Greetings. I heard everything. Apparently, this village is cursed by a snake. Yes. My daughter, Kinu, is possessed by a white snake. Don't worry. I will save your daughter from the curse. The snake has a strong spirit. I will have to remove it from your daughter's body with supernatural power. - Is that alright? - Yes. I have to do it now. Otherwise, your daughter will go to animal hell. No, she might be already there. Huh? The life of an animal is cheap. It can go to Shangri-La, but even a small mistake... and it will face eternal damnation. I just want to save her from animal hell. Is that alright? Yes. Lady Sakurako! I brought Minokichi here. Huh? Minokichi? Kinu! Minokichi! I missed you! I missed you too. I won't let you go. I won't leave you even if I have to die. Mino, I am happy! I will be with you forever. Really? Yes. - Kinu! - Minokichi! Please escape into the mountains before anyone sees you. Yes. Let's go. Mino! Kinu! I'm happy! I am so happy! Mino! Mother! Come, Kiyo has been worried about you too. She came here with me to save you. No! I won't leave her no matter what! You can consider me dead. Please give up. Are you still talking nonsense? Come home! I won't. I am going to live with her no matter what. Mino! Where are you going? Minokichi! - Kiyo, let's follow him. - Yes! - Hurry! - Mino! Mino! Emergency! My mother is here! Let's run away! Don't separate from me! Lady Sakurako, I wish you a happy life. I will protect you until the end. Kinu! That's the place. I see. Be careful, everyone. - Alright. - Alright. - Let's go. - Alright. The stronger ones climb first. - Climb first. - Yes. Don't slip. Be careful. Are you alright? Don't slip. Shoo! Go away! Go away! Shoo! Go away! Go away! Shoo! Go away! Go away! Shoo! Go away! Go away! Go away! Help! What's wrong? Mister! The snakes... Please help! Minokichi! We can't escape now. Let's die. Die? If they catch us, we will have to break up. I can't take it. Minokichi, let's die! If we die, we can go to a place... where nobody can catch us and live there happily. Kinu! Minokichi! SnakeGrave Minokichi! Kinu! Strangle me with your body. Ah! What's wrong! It hurts! It hurts! Let go of me! Kinu! Let me go! Let go of me! Let me die with Kinu! Please! Let me die with her! Kinu! Monk! What are you going to do to Kinu? Stop! She is possessed by the snake. She is controlled by the snake's spirit. So what? Intimacy with an animal is non-Buddhistic behavior. Let her go! Break up with her! No! Idiot! You were tricked by the snake and are voluntarily ruining your own life! How stupid! It's none of your business! Abandon your desire and save her. That's real love. Real love? Yes. Save her from animal hell and guide her to a human life. That's real love. Minokichi! Kinu! Mino! Kinu! Mino! Kinu! Begone! The snake spirit disappeared! The white snake died! Kinu has died. Minokichi! The snake spirit that once was Sakurako... got into Kinu's body and drained her life. A snake spirit is a scary thing. Monk! I'm scared! I want to atone for my sins. Please make me your pupil. Please! Would you renounce the world and come with me? Yes. Let's go. Yes. The End
