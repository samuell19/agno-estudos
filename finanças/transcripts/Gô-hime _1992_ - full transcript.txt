BASARA - THE PRINCESS GOH Directed by Hiroshi TESHIGAHARA Rikyu's tea ceremony... was truly visionary, wasn't it? What a precious person to have killed. But even though he's dead... he'll always be my best teacher. Whenever I perform the tea ceremony... I feel Rikyu's guidance in my hands. He didn't have to die... he chose to. In the afterlife I'll make it my business to haunt him. Lord Oribe... You have a smile on your face... but inside you feel like weeping. I can tell. You and Tadaoki... went to see Rikyu off in Yodo. I know you and Tadaoki openly bade him farewell... knowing I might disapprove. It's true I didn't approve of it. Why do you keep silent? Say something. Well... could you tell me... why you ordered Rikyu's death? Rikyu . .. was guilty of insolence. - Insolence? - Right. Everyone was talking about it... Rikyu's insolent misbehavior. But was it true or only gossip. I'm asking your Lordship directly... convince me that he deserved to die. Why should I convince you? Rikyu's insolence... all the rumors going around... tell me you didn't know. They had a wooden statue of him dedicated in the temple. What of it? The priests were simply flattering Rikyu. But having to pass under him to enter... your highness would have felt slighted... It must have made you angry. I don't know. Some claimed that Rikyu was after money... that he sold inferior tea utensils to the Lords at greatly inflated prices. This further angered your highness. Absurd! Rikyu knew the value of everything. Anyway... Sakai people are all merchants. Merchants sell to make a profit. What's wrong with that? Anything else to add? I hesitate to say, my lord. You're referring to his daughter, Ogin? Well then... his daughter has lovely big hips and breasts... therefore... I thought she'd be able to bear me healthy children. However... Rikyu put himself in my way. Maybe getting a daughter when so old made him love her more. Is that all? I'll make bold to speak, my lord. I'd heard that Rikyu refused to obey your order... to poison Lord Ieyasu. There are some things that must never be mentioned... Oribe. Personally, the idea of poisoning anyone disgusts me. I prefer whenever possible... to turn poison into medicine... and thus make friends of my enemies... no? What I wanted to say... I've said. How it must trouble you... since all this means... I ordered Rikyu's death... without needing any real reason at all. Well, Lord Oribe... I want you to create a proper tea ceremony for the Lords. Rikyu's ceremony was of no use to me. Even knowing that, Rikyu wouldn't change. Inflexible men... fight to the bitter end. Fight to the bitter end... though they lose everything. They won't surrender. Some may consider... such actions as noble. Unless a man lives... he has no future. Matters of politics... I, Hideyoshi, take care of. Matters of the tea ceremony... Oribe... I leave that to you. Try to perform your duties... better than Rikyu. Understood? Did I surprise you, Uncle Oribe? You're doing it again... behaving most unlike a princess. You're a naughty girl... one day you'll be the wife of someone important. Your father will scold you. Even if he scolds me, I'll never change. His highness says... Goh's perfect as she is. That can't be right... he'll surely be cross. No way. "Why weren't you born a boy... "so that you could have succeeded me as ruler." That's what he said. What Uncle... leaving already? Take me with you, if you're going home. It's been a while. You wait. I'll talk to my father. - Promise? - Yes. Uncle... smell this and then tell me... what you think it is? Look‚Äù. Ohh... how lovely. It's the first one this spring. I love it when the dandelions are blooming everywhere. What about you, Uncle? This is for you. Thank you very much. I appreciate it deeply. "The nazuna blossoms of Cho-an... fully bloomed nazuna... (Cho-an = ancient Kyoto) (nazuna = Shepherd's Purse) "Popping up through the snow... "until all picked out... "in the cold of early spring." I'm here! Usu... that's interesting... Could I have it? His lordship told me that I am his new tea master. However... that means you're the best in the land. You don't seem very happy. He gave me a warning... "do better than Rikyu." What...? Rikyu...!? Hello...! Bring some sake! Here it is. From now on... you'd best... not be too rigid. Hideyoshi doesn't like men who're too honourable. The minds of rulers are hard to understand. To those below them they can seem like madmen. All rulers become like that. As for myself... maybe I seem like a madman to my retainers. Uncle Oribe... open the door. My hands are full. Who's that? A very formidable person... the daughter of Lord Maeda, Princess Goh. Princess Goh? I attend! You brought all this by yourself... thank you. I wanted to drink with you... so I brought three cups. Princess... do you know this gentleman? Yes, of course I do... the honourable Lord Gamo. He looks as strong... as people say he is. In your province... I've heard it snows heavily. Does it really? Princess Goh madam... you are most correct. Is that so? I saw something strange today... it's about Rikyu. What did you see? You don't know? Rikyu's head. What? It was absolute madness. They put his head... at the foot of his wooden statue. What? It made me so angry... it was such disgusting behaviour. The kind of thing only Kyoto people would do. Probably someone trying to curry favour. As much as Hideyoshi may be a sly fox... he'd never have done something so low. I'm... going- It's gone! The head's gone! She's Maeda's daughter, you say? Yes, as soon as she was born... Hideyoshi adopted her. Being a girl... eventually... she'll have to marry a feudal lord. I feel... very sorry for her. You old man... you're in love, eh? Look closely at their swords! There's no telling... what the old man's up to. Enough! Stop! Let's go! Goh... shooting your bow at Oribe was bad enough. Today you went too far! Next time this sort of thing happens, I may have to punish you. I'm afraid young virgins... tend to be thoughtless. You're angry? Your anger makes your cheeks... look like plum blossoms. As your father, I love you. Do I have to see him here? Call that servant here. He's an insolent fellow. This one? What's he called? Usu - it means "mortar". Mortar? But he isn't that round. How true! He does have a curious name. Lord Oribe... Ask him the reason... why he chased and harassed my retainers like that? This is Lord Oribe's mansion... That samurai was jumping over our wall... I should be asking you why. What? What an impertinent way to speak! Usu... careful. Tell his lordship truthfully... what happened. Well... Lord Oribe found me and raised me. I owe him everything. I work as his gardener. Throw him over the wall...? He was an intruder... I threw him out. What else should I have done? What an amazing creature! Like in Kyogen. He makes me laugh! (Kyogen = traditional comic theater) "Genji, Genji... annoying, annoying servant. "Oh Genji, damn Genji... annoying, annoying servant... "most annoying of man servants." Goh... Bad woman... very cunning. About Rikyu... sincerely it wasn't my wish. I know, my lord. Yesterday I heard for the first time... that Rikyu's head was being displayed. It was an attempt... by someone to show their loyalty. But what a mess! I had intended... to have Rikyu's head re-interred. I had thought... it would ease the minds... of those close to him. But then that basara girl... snatched the head away, together with that peculiar Usu. (basara = the challenge of traditional ideals) I followed them and found myself... Lord Oribe... outside the wall of your mansion. What do you think? Interesting, no? I suspect your man Usu... knows where Rikyu's head is now. Lord Oribe... take care of it... discreetly. I'd like to have a word with you. Ah... Lord Hosokawa. That's typical... of the princess. You must have had a difficult time yesterday. Not all that hard. But yes, a bit difficult. Ujisato came to stay at my place. He was all excited. I can only imagine. He's moody and unpredictable... dealing with him gets harder and harder. But the officials made things even more difficult... displaying Rikyu's head in such an unseemly manner. Did you see it? I avoided the place. Being inflexible isn't good... being hot-tempered isn't good. Being stubborn can lead to a short life. Do be careful. I apologize for causing so much trouble. Ujisato's a real hero... he didn't even come to help. Doesn't look it... but he's a coward. Oribe here was no different. When I was in danger... he didn't even lift a finger. He just stood there watching. But Usu was with you, wasn't he? Why are you turning away? Why did you hit the brazier? A zen dialogue! Give Usu to me. What? If Usu agrees... will you let me have him? Is that what he wants too? I don't know... Well... if you told him to... he'd definitely serve me. I doubt it, but then you know what they say... even a tiny insect has a soul. However, the insect Usu... has a much greater soul than that. It's not likely then... that he'll serve me. Not necessarily. Why not ask him first? I wonder how he'll answer. No...he won't come... that's clear. He's like a dog. He obeys only one master. He'd only serve me... because you told him to. His master is you after all... not me. Your highness... evidently you want Usu very much. Where did you hide him? What? Hasn't he returned yet? You sent Usu off, right? I was told... to deliver this to Lady Ogin. By whom? I'm not a liberty to say. Excuse me. Wait please... who sent you here? It was someone... to whom Rikyu was very dear. Don't... put it out. I'm... not Rikyu's own daughter. I'm happy... turning to ashes... together with him. Please... just stay... until I die. Who is it? Stay away! (Both kanji together = "Self knowledge by identity in silence") NOTHINGNESS - SOUL (This kanji always hung in Rikyu's tea room.) NOTHINGNESS Come... Where have you been? Please... send me away. What about Rikyu's head...? - All that... it's all my fault. - I don't think so. Where did you take it? And then what...? Lady Ogin... To Lady Ogin? Lady Ogin... - Lady Ogin killed herself. - What?! Get ahold of yourself. This isn't like you. Breathe slowly... Exhale... Inhale. She wasn't Rikyu's own daughter. What? Usu... who told you that? Lady Ogin herself... as she was dying. Did you meet anyone... on your way back here? I met no one... except for... The Princess Goh... Where did you meet her? Only Princess G-oh? That's good. My lord, please... send me away. Worried I'm going to fall out of favour? I just want to be dismissed. You'd rather serve Princess Goh... than serve Lord Oribe? I don't mind... It's only... Kyoto frightens me. Any complaints against me? No, sire! Never... never. Usu... you're ready now. Become one of my samurai... if you wish. I appreciate your generous offer. But... I don't want to be a samurai. Stop! I'm Oribe Furuta... En guard! You say you're Lord Furuta. Maybe... but we don't want you here. I regard you merely... as an old man using that name. Interfere here and we'll kill you! Uncle...! Go! Leave the rest to Usu! But he's wounded... No, he isn't. You think... I'd let any man I love be shot? Love? How did you know Usu would come this way? Usu himself told me. When was that? Last night. Where was that? Must I tell you every detail? I'm sorry. Please spare me! Calm your heart... or it'll bleed more. It hurts. I know it hurts. Let it hurt. This is to return your kindness. Tell me... did you really come here to see him off? No... I didn't even know he'd pass this way. If I'd known... I would've sent archers. Usu sneaked into my bedroom... and forced himself on me. I changed my mind... when I discovered Mitsunari had sent assassins... to kill Usu so he wouldn't talk... especially about Rikyu's head. Moreover... Mitsunari was to kill me too. And so... I decided not to kill Usu. I decided to let him live. I felt sorry for him. I felt as if I were in love with him. Ahh... when that princess isn't around... you sure groan a lot. But groaning won't... stop the pain. - Old bastard! - What...? I just saved your life... and you call me a bastard? I found you... all but frozen out in the snow. I... I don't mind dying. Is that so? Is love so painful? - It's not that. - Eh? - Don't blame it on that. - Course not. I'd be... better off dead... - ...better off dead. - Whatever you say. But this thing here... says you want to live. You'll catch cold. What's wrong? The cloth... the cloth that was on my head? It was so dirty... I threw it away... in the stream. Right... right. I didn't know it was so important to you. I'm sorry. Old man... what's your name? My name...? Well... just call me Junsai. Junsai? If you master everything I know... you could live here for a century. But then... there's one thing that I just can't deal with. - So what's that? - Ah? - What is it? Women. I don't like them. Don't talk like that! Live all alone by yourself for too long... and even monkeys start looking good. Not so easy, eh? Don't just stand there! He's alive! Merciful Buddha... Hurry! Junsaisku. I can't go on doing this. Like you did, I'll live by myself, hidden in the mountains. You're being selfish! Now that you've seen all this... I can't let you stay alive. - But I'm already dead. - No! You're still alive. Listen... leave me alone and don't come back... go! That's enough! I came to thank you for the fish. Sit down. You live in a nice home. The fish were delicious. I suppose... you know that Hideyoshi died. On the other hand... your Oribe has been excluded from court by Ieyasu. Poor man! But I'm not interested in feudal lords. Ieyasu is afraid of the Christians. The Christians in Japan are becoming a major force... so Ieyasu fears them. Certainly is a nice day. Drink this. Thank you. Usu... do you know what happened to that princess of yours? I'm no longer concerned. As it happens... she's in the custody of her father Lord Maeda, in Kaga. Junsaisku. How much armor have you got in that cave? Princess Goh's husband Hideie Ukita... was defeated at Sekigahara. He was exiled to Hachijo Island. So... What do you intend to do with all that armor in the cave? Do you have plans for it or is it... just to look at it? You make lots of useless stuff you just like to look at. I like useless stuff better. It's more interesting. But you... in fact... are interested only in collecting things? You'll never know how I feel. Which lumber do you plan to use? White cedar from Hida. Some old man has come. He's asking to see you. His name is Junsai. Junsai? Junsai? It can't be! Junsai KITA! Yes... I'm so happy to see you again! So it's you, you old fool. Good to see you! Come here. Come in. I consider it a great honor to be granted an audience with you. How have you been? It's seventeen years since I left you. I've managed to stay alive. So then... Your former retainers who dispersed into the mountains... are waiting for you to rise and take action. For me to rise? Exactly. We lost the battle at Sekigahara... but the country's still in turmoil... and needs you. Now's the time for you to seize the rulership of Japan. Before Tokugawa Ieyasu can strengthen his position... please hurry and take your decision. Your retainers are ready to fight... you just have to give the order. Dying in battle beside his Lord... is a warrior's duty and greatest honour. But I've already... renounced weapons. JunsaL_ try to understand my decision. I'm sorry... JunsaL_ It's the will of God that I don't fight. God simply doesn't want me to fight. Go away!.. Go away!.. Is he saying... that Christians will no longer fight? Or... just making a fool of me because I'm old! Uncle... you sure you're up to it? Let's do it again... okay? - What? One more time? - Sure... sure. All right. Wait... just a minute. What's this? No good. Just a... give me that. Is it all right...? Taking such a strong, strong medicine? It's bad for your health. Who cares? We all die anyway. Now, look at that... Good medicine! I'm strong enough now! Uncle...? Uncle! Old man! Are you all right? - That you, Usu? - Yes... yes. I'm... I'm... done for. It's the end of me. Junsai, don't die. Hang on. Be brave. "To Sir Ukon Takayama From Junsai" You knew I was once a Christian. You insisted on bringing me here. You paid my release. You said of all the women... I was the one you wanted to die with... didn't you. Step aside. What do you want?! I'm obliged... for your help. Women really are too weak. I almost couldn't get angry enough to resist them. Maybe I'm starting to become an older woman. You... Come with me... let me give you some new clothes. If it weren't for you, who knows what would have happened? Nothing, your mistress is very strong. Still, it taught me a good lesson. Come this way. It's quiet here. My lady lives here alone. Her husband and sons were banished to Hachijo island. Her family's been dispersed. She's all alone. So... this will be your castle. It's a little small... but they say you can stay as long as you like. The lord is here! You're too careless! Careless about what? Going out with no thought... all by yourself. With no thought? I like that. Go to bed, with no thought... isn't that right? I live that way. Day after day, with no thought. What else can I do? Today those men wanted me... I enjoyed an afternoon to remember. Anyway, dear sister... please be more careful. The Tokugawas are all around. You can't be too careful. You must be always on your guard. The Tokugawas again! My husband exiled... my mother gone as hostage... The Tokugawa's should be thankful they're even alive! Now they expect me to humble myself to them!? You must do it for the Maedas. I know that. I was just saying. Thank you kindly, but... The cottage isn't comfortable enough? Sorry, but no thanks. I'm telling you to stay! Please! For warriors health is important. Yes. When people are ill they imagine things. Lord Oribe, are you in good health? I don't have any physical problems. Having no physical problems isn't enough. Ukon Takayama contracted this disease called "Christianity". He's staying with the Maedas... and, so I hear... working as hard as any soldier. You have so many medicines... but none of them will work for him. The Maeda's only build castles. People who try too hard often succumb to fevers. I'm also a bit like that... I keep firing new ceramic bowls. True artisans are forced to concentrate intensely... it can cause them to become stubborn and sometimes selfish. Tea-masters should be careful not to be like that. Rikyu was like that. What do you think, Oribe sir? If I may speak frankly my Lord... The joy of creating things... lies in revealing something new in the world. It's difficult to know the value of something new... it's beyond estimation. Thus sometimes, creators may indeed appear selfish. Rikyu was an example of this. What did you just say? ...reveal new things? Yes. - That's not necessary. - Yes. Lord Oribe, you're the Tea Master to the Shogun. The finest utensils are at your disposal. Isn't it your duty to make the best use of these very fine utensils? You're absolutely right, Lord Ogosho. However... though I admit that these fine utensils have their own value... I cannot deny the joy... that comes with creating something truly new. Don't you agree that it's nature's providence that we do so? Christians like to use this word "providence"... what do they mean? Something beyond human wisdom... Divine will... but I'm not sure. Are you a Christian? - No. - Then forget about providence. Yes. Human wisdom has made this unhappy world. It's not the way of the Buddha. - You sister married Ukon, right? - Yes. So you must know something about Christianity. I know nothing. I've been shocked by ltakura's report... that this fever prevails in my fief, too. 14 of my retainers and 3 of my ladies are now Christians. It's a disgrace. It's becoming an epidemic. An absolute prohibition of Christianity... doesn't work either. Lord Oribe... warriors must remain healthy. They say there are 750,000 Christians in Japan. Well... actually the figure might be only half that. But if a general like Ukon now confined in Kaga, unites them... then their war-potential might exceed... even that of the Tokugawas. What if Christianity were banned now? It would have no effect on foreign trade. Then... it's time to get Ukon on the move. Right. What should we do about Oribe? He's Ukon's brother-in-law... and one of his sons is in the enemy force. He may be a great artisan... but he's no threat to us as a warrior. But he likes the Christians... and it's catching. Oribe's tea ceremony... tends to ideal beauty... no strength of spirit... no worldly practicality. It doesn't suit my world... wouldn't you agree? This has just arrived from Hachijo Island from your exiled husband. Oh... really? It's been exactly one year. There we go. These must be from your sons. This seems to be some sort of tree fruit. I see it's called a "coconut". "To Mother. Aug. 16. Magokuro and Koheiji" "I found this on the beach and thought to send it to you." Ahh... They're good in writing and drawing. They must be very grown up now. Why don't you chop more? There's no need. I've already chopped enough. Chop more! I told you to chop more wood. Living here is getting tiresome. It's time I was moving on. You'll go when I tell you to go. Why do you treat me this way? Listen to me. You're stubborn... but I can't seem to forget about you! Still you insist on ignoring me. Don't you scorn me? - You don't even call me by name. - Stupid! I took you in didn't I?! I'll perform a tea-ceremony here. I'll invite Uncle Oribe... Ukon Takayama... and Tadaoki Hosokawa. People always seem to grow apart. You must miss Uncle Oribe, no? - But I left. I owe him so much... - That's in the past now. We'll go see Ukon tomorrow. Oh... it's you is it? I haven't visited you in a long time. Please forgive me. Why should you apologize? I am the one at fault. It's my wish to perform a tea ceremony. Inviting... you, Lord Oribe and Tadaoki Hosokawa. I would host it... if that's acceptable. Superb... When would it be? When the cherry trees are in full bloom. How about... the twenty-eighth of next month? That day... what is it? Rikyu's death anniversary. Ah yes... of course. Then let's do that. It's a good idea. Unfortunately for me... I'll be unable to attend. Why not? Ieyasu has ordered me to move to Nagasaki. What? When must you go? Very soon, I believe. Ieyasu! So he's after you. How can you sit here playing the organ knowing this? I've only just recently begun to enjoy it. But is there nothing you can do? What about Oribe? Yes... I've already informed him. There's no time for that now. Maybe I came here by intuition today. This is very good. Is everything ready? Yes, it's all set. No peaceful settlement? Unlikely... I doubt Ieyasu will compromise. He's getting old... and feels compelled... to hurry everything. He must get rid of all obstacles. After having done that... he'll be ready to play absolute tyrant. As a natural consequence... I will lose my position. Lord Nobunaga and Lord Hideyoshi lit the flames of change... by elevating worthy commoners... No way will I be the one to dampen them. Usu sir has arrived. - Nao... - Yes. Will you take this to Lord Oribe? Oribe's home is well known to you. As for Lord Tadaoki... Oribe will tell you where he lives. You're the only one I can ask to do this. USU? Come in. Where have you been managing to survive? Well... I was travelling. What are you doing now? Well... I once nearly died in the mountains. I'm surviving as an empty shell of a man. You haven't changed. You look strong. Perhaps... you've grown a little older. Not really... you haven't changed a bit. So... where have you come from today? - I've come from Kaga. - What? - To deliver this. - From Kaga? This handwriting... - It's Princess Goh's? - Yes... Usu... is it perchance... at Princess G-oh's that you are 'surviving'? Well... before I realized... it just happened. Just... by chance... sort of. Same as always. It's just like the Princess. I wonder how she is? She looks... as young now as in her twenties. But now it's becoming very hard to know what she's thinking... at least for me. She married a feudal lord, but he was exiled, wasn't he? Princess Goh is a Maeda woman... The Odas, Toyotomis and the Tokugawas... hated them but had to respect their nobility, so they've survived. The clan leader has decided to die at difficult times... Toshiie and his son Toshinaga. Lady 'Mother' Matsu has shouldered clan leadership at great sacrifice to herself. A strong willed woman, that one. And then Goh is her daughter. So it's no wonder she keeps her thoughts to herself. What shall I say is your answer? You should have no doubt... of course I'll attend Princess Goh's tea ceremony. Lord Oribe Furuta... has arrived! Open the gate! As the Shogun's master of the tea-ceremony, Lord Oribe... you must act very carefully. You mean I shouldn't go? No... Absolutely not! Think about it. On Hideyori Uchida's intercession, Goh was returned to her family. Toshiie Maeda is dead, but the Maeda power hasn't been quenched. The heir, Toshitsune, is very young, but within him are the embers of the old fire. Old rulers can be very unpredictable... you surely remember Hideyoshi well enough. And that's not all... The tradition of Rikyu's tea-ceremony is in one man's hands... ...yours, Lord Oribe. I advise you, as his disciple... do not accept Goh's invitation. What about Ukon...? He already fled Nagasaki for Luzon. They tried to sink his ship while it was sailing out of the harbor. If he had died in Japan, the Christians would have risen in rebellion. But he's out of Japan... and that's good for us. What's so good about it? - He might join our foreign enemies. - Right. By the way... next spring Lord Oribe Furuta will go to Kaga... to attend a tea-ceremony being performed by Princess Goh. To Kaga of the Maedas? Yes. What on earth's he thinking? Stop. They're finally in full bloom. In the distance, your head seemed... like a white dandelion seed-puff. Dandelion blooms everywhere... Do you remember when "I" said that, Uncle? (ore- women generally use watashi) (ore- women generally use watashi) Still using the masculine pronoun, eh? (ore- women generally use watashi) Your tea was most delicious. Oh yes... I remember this bowl. So... you do. It carries the mark of your prank. You made it when you were quite young, didn't you? Young or not... I never made another after I married. So it's one of my last. Do you remember back then... the silly argument we had? Oh... you mean about Usu. That's the one. You may have heard... that I ran into him again by chance. We really have no idea at all... what God's conspiring for us. - So then Uncle... - Yes. Aren't you curious what happened to me... these last 20 years? Well you see... listening to unhappy stories... doesn't suit my nature. That gilded thing in the alcove... is a coconut sent from my husband. It was filled with sand from Hachijo Island. It pleased me greatly. It shows his regard, no? You arranged your alcove so beautifully. It truly impressed me. What you do shines like a light, encouraging all those who come to you. You think so? Truly? Yes. Then, being alive isn't so bad, is it then? With Ujisato and Ukon gone, I feel... Now, now, Uncle Oribe... unhappy stories aren't in your nature. Oh no, no... I walked right into that! But... how is it that... all this happiness falls to me alone? Is it right... to monopolize it? Goodness... I'm completely bewildered. I sincerely hope... that we might meet in your tea room next. It holds some fond memories. I made tea for Hideyoshi there. I met Ujisato for the first time... in that room. We'll meet there on Rikyu's next death anniversary. Agreed. Then Uncle Oribe... 'til that day take very good care. My princess be always more and more well. Take up pottery again. I expect great things. Farewell. I presume that you are the Lord Oribe Furuta. I, who serve the Governor of Kyoto, the honorable Lord Itakura... am known as Terasaki. I'm under his direct orders to escort you to him now. Please come with us peacefully. What kind of order is this? I, Lord Oribe, cannot accept it. I understand how you feel. However, Governor Itakura will explain his true intentions... directly to you. For the trip to Nagata... we've prepared a palanquin for you. Bring it here! Remove their swords! I have something to tell you. The fact is... one Soki Kimura has attempted... to assassinate Shogun Hidetada and his wife. He's been arrested. The ringleader's still unknown. But this Soki Kimura is Oribe Furuta's chief vassal. So Oribe is the prime suspect. Oribe was one of the Shogun's advisers... The Shogun's wife is very upset. Oribe's being held... under house arrest. Are you a Tokugawa spy? So you are. You told the governor about my tea-ceremony. Get out of here... this instant! Be sure to tell him... that I've just performed the finest tea-ceremony ever. My lady... Usu sir is here as requested. Go to Kyoto... get as close to Oribe as you can. It won't be easy to approach him. But you can do it. This time you could die. I'm asking you to risk your life for my sake. What's my life... what does it matter. You're saying you won't go? Who says I won't? If you find yourself facing death, remember this moment... when you gave your life to Goh. I said I didn't care about my life. Oribe is certain to die. They are sure to kill him. He went against the Shogun... by abetting the Christians' doomed cause. For what he's done, they have to execute him. Do you think he really intended betrayal? I don't know. I'll... go. You always were headstrong. Usu... give this tea cup to Uncle Oribe. Give a dandelion with it. Yes. ...if you're lucky enough to meet him. - The Fushimi house in Kyoto? - I don't know. Anyway, go to the Maeda mansion in Kyoto. Ask Towa. Hurry. To physically meet with Lord Oribe, Princess Goh actually ordered you to try and do that? Enough Grandma. F at chance. He's being closely guarded by the governor's samurai. Itakura's guards are tougher than tough. No matter how tough the guards... it's still Lord Oribe's house and I'll find a way in. You're not half confident. Usu... Don't worry. Who'd kill a minor servant like you? I don't care if they tear you limb from limb... nothing must be traced to Princess Goh. If they catch you... use this dagger. Be sure... no mistakes. I won't get caught. I'll make it back... and give her my report. Fool! Seeing I'm under house arrest... I won't invite you in. You're safer there. Princess Goh sent you? Yes, my lord. You say that just like a samurai. I remember when you said... you didn't want to be a samurai. My second son, Sakon died in the battle for Osaka Castle... My fourth son, Kuhachiro, also fought in that castle. There was nothing remarkable about their deaths. But, I felt sorry for them. I'm really lonely. Ujisato died... Ukon's gone too. Neither will I... ever see... Princess Goh again. It's his Lordship who arrives. No need for alarm. Here they come. Open the gate... open up. Usu... you've come all this way to say farewell... just as this life of mine is coming to an end. I appreciate that. Usu... For her dandelion... give Princess G-oh my heartfelt thanks. So... get home safely. At the battle for Osaka... you knowingly conspired to assist the enemy force. You then lead your men in an attack to set fire to Nijo Castle. For these grievous crimes... you are ordered to commit seppuku. (seppuku = ritual suicide) On this eleventh day of June, in this year Keicho 20 (1615). So... at this final moment... Final moment? Would you like to compose... your death poem? Oh... that's what you're talking about? It is the accepted custom... before one takes one's life. Please... You mean that, before committing seppuku, I must chirp a few words? What then shall I chirp? Well then... it's an odd custom, isn't it? If I don't chirp something... it might be seen as a failing on your part. I'll chirp like this... I am fallen into the depths of the abyss. Between the nobles and the commoners... no difference do I see. I am fallen into the depths of the abyss. Could you repeat the last part? Between the nobles and the commoners... no difference do I see. Is that enough? That's all then. Your death poem... is duly recorded. Then... I refuse to commit seppuku. What? Were I a mere commoner... I would accept an order of death... and commit seppuku. Rikyu's was just such a case. But at this final moment... I have decided otherwise. I am fallen into the depths of the abyss. Between the nobles and the commoners, no difference do I see. As I see it now from the depths of the abyss... the order from Ieyasu, a nobleman to commit seppuku... I cannot accept! Lord Oribe...! You've gone mad. I heard that Lord Oribe has committed seppuku. You've already heard? I'm tired. Let me sleep for a while. I'll see my lady after I've had some sleep. Very well. In Kyoto, you came into my bedroom... so tonight I'll do likewise and come into yours. Then it was after Rikyu's mistress... Ogin had died. This time, it's Uncle Oribe who has died. Each time we've come together to talk of someone's death. As a reason for a man and woman to come together... it's so prosaic! Don't worry about it... leave it as it is. Did you actually see... how Uncle Oribe met his death? I couldn't actually see... I heard. Odd... thing to say. I had to hide under the house... and listen. There was no way to get to see what happened. Is that so? What a pity you had no chance... to meet Uncle Oribe... or even speak with him. No... we met... and I spoke with him. Where then? In his sitting room. That dear place! Reminds me of Rikyu's head... when you took it away with you. A dear place. And Uncle Oribe... how was he then...? Calm, poised, proud... as usual? I felt no change in him. But... I didn't show myself... I merely... put the cup on his veranda. Your sudden arrival... did it surprise him? He sent his heartfelt thanks for your dandelion. Do obstinate men have no fear because of their obstinacy? No... it's the fear of death that gives them such obstinacy? He moved against the wind. He dashed against the rocks. Did he realize the "essence of the Way of Tea"? I wish I'd been born a man... and could lose my life in the "essence of the Way of Tea". Usu... what are you going to do? Go home to my pottery in Mino. You great big fool... what are you saying? I asked you what you're going to do... right now. Who cares where you want to go or with whom? Right this instant, Usu... will you hold me like you did that night... on the other hand... shall I hold you? Directed by Hiroshi TESHIGAHARA
