Get out! Hey! Did you eat the last creamfilled? Yeah, I left you a glazed one. I don't know how you can eat those things every day like that. They don't even seem to do anything to you. Yeah, I guess I'm just blessed like that. I guess. Hey, you see this? See what? That Cincinnati baseball team made the front page again. This player right here? He's gonna be in the Hall of Fame before it's all over. You mark my words. Oh, yeah, no, he's a great player. Ike! You need to come in here and take a look at this. Got a new APB today. Looks like he resurfaced. I tell you, this guy is bad news. Seems like every time something crazy goes down, somebody has a description that fits this clown. Now, today we have a sketch, but all we know is that he goes by the name of Luc. Yeah, he is a shadylookin' character. To say the least. The guy came outta nowhere, I don't know about Who's that? I don't know, but the door's unlocked. Gabe! Gabe, it's a baby. I'll wager I save that soul. What was that? Nothing. Nothing at all. So, what're you gonna do? What am I gonna do? What're you gonna do? What do you mean, what am I gonna do? Don't stress it, kid, I'm gonna walk you through it. The first thing you're gonna do is contact Children Services and I wouldn't waste any time, 'cause it's gettin' a little late. Unless you don't mind babysitting all night? It's a tough break, kid. And you know, since you found the baby, you have to do the report, too. Look, I gotta break you in right. One day, you're gonna be running this place. Yeah, how do you know that? I know stuff. Hi, this is the 32nd Precinct. We, uh... We have an abandoned baby. Yes, he was left on the front steps of the station. Yeah, in the rain. Okay. All right. Thank you very much. So, how long, Ike? Well, that was the case worker on call. It's gonna be at least an hour or two. With it being so late, they don't know if they're gonna have a home for him tonight or not. How does someone do that? How can you do that to your own kid? There are plenty of reasons. None of them right, though. I mean, they might be devoid of moral foundation or, down and out, strung out, drug addict, you get the picture. Whatever their frame of mind, man, it's always sad. But you are going to be all right. Yes, you are. Yes, you are, you gonna be all right, yes, you are. Hold on, man, what's this? What is it? Baby has a tag tied to his wrist. What's it say? It says Brucie. His name is Bruce. You gonna be just fine. I mean, is she coming or not? It's been a while. Calm down, Ike. These things take time, she'll be here. I know, but we're not, we're not equipped to... Yeah, I know what you mean. But everything's gonna be all right, now that you found the lad. Now, if you hadn't had found him, that would've been a different story. He could've been out there, laying around, hour after hour in the cold rain and then hypothermia sets I don't even wanna think about that. I mean, Gabe, you know how I feel. You know. Hey, I do. I know you were raised... Look, at least you were adopted. Think of it this way, at least we heard the knock at the door and you found him the way that you did. You know, that, that could've been me. I mean, that was me, really. It's not you, kid. You did good, look at you. It's gonna be all right with him, too. You may wanna put him on your prayer list. Yeah. Of course I will. Hi. I'm so glad you're here. I'm Ike Ramsey, that's Chief Angelus down the hall. So, this is the little guy. Someone actually left him here at the precinct, huh? Yeah. His name's Brucie. There's a tag tied around his wrist. So they did. Well, Little Brucie, let's get you out of here. What's, uh, I'm sorry, what's going to happen to him? Foster care's already lined up. I have preliminary supplies with me. I'll be dropping him off tonight. So, he's gonna a foster home? Yes. In fact, they're waiting on him now. Oh, by the way, I'll need a copy of the report tomorrow. Of course. But, uh, before you go. This was given to me on the day I was adopted by my mom. It says, "I will always watch over you," and it has my name, Ike. I guess it kinda reads like, "I'll be the one watching over you now." I hope that's what my prayers do. It's yours now. Good luck. Hey. Hi. It smells good. It's almost finished. Thanks. How was your night? Ike? Someone left a baby at the precinct. A baby? I was the one who found him. Are you all right? Yeah, it just... Just brought a lot back, you know? Just stuff I kinda buried. Yeah. I remember you talking about some of those things. His name was Bruce. They left a name tag tied around his wrist. I just hate to think about him having to go through the same thing. And they just left him on the steps? Yeah. They didn't even hang around to see if we'd find him. I can't even imagine what was going through your head. I didn't know what to think. Even Gabe was shaken up, and he doesn't get excited about anything. Are you done? Yeah, I'm sorry, I just... Guess I don't really have much of an appetite. It's okay. Hey, buddy. How's my little man? Lord. Please watch over my son. Steer him clear of things that may cause pain, or misfortune or death. Please keep him in your grace should he stray. Please help lead him back to you. And please watch over on Brucie, too. Let him find a home and love and care. Amen. He's so peaceful. Yeah, he is. Oh, God, what a night. Yeah. Let's not think about that for a bit. Yeah. Okay. Dagnabit Brucie, you won again. Who's next? I am. Bring it. Oh, trust me. I am. I got this one. I beat you last week. I'll be spending your lunch money this week. In your dreams. Yeah. I got next. All right. All right, what is this? Should've known it was you. I wasn't the only one, did you see them? No, no, you weren't, but since you like betting so much, I bet you're the ringleader. Now, get to class! Do you know what we're doing in science today? I have no clue. I guess we'll find out soon. Yeah, I guess so. I'll see you later, okay? Bye. Hey, Brucie. Oh, hey, Suzy, what's up? What's up with you? I haven't seen you all summer. Well, you know, little bit of this and a little bit of that. Yep, so, up to no good then? Aw, come on, Suzy, you know me. I ain't no trouble. That is, as long as I don't get caught. Yeah, that's exactly what I mean. You're such a cutup. You need to stop, you know? You don't have to act like that. Why don't you let other people see you the way I see you? Yeah, right. You know I can't do that. Yes, you can. I know I believe in you. I know you have your troubles, but I know you. No, you don't. That's just how I act around you. I don't, I don't think you know. Just stop! I know what you're trying to do. You're just trying to make excuses instead of accepting yourself for who you really are, and you know where that starts. Yeah, yeah, I know what you're trying to say. It starts with me going to church with you. Yeah, I know you've heard it before, but you need to hear it again. You need to know it's the truth. Look, I told you before, I'll go. I just don't know when. Yeah. Heard that before. I know. Well, you need to decide when and let me know. Well, saved by the bell. We gotta hurry. Lisa, can you lead the Pledge for us today? I pledge allegiance To the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Thank you. Brucie? Lunch money then. Thank you. Good morning, Lincoln Valley Middle School students. This is Mrs. Moore with the morning announcements. The PTA meeting is this week, so your teacher will be sending home a reminder for your parents. Remember, this Friday is the Sweetheart Dance at seven o'clock. Gentlemen, you must wear a shirt and tie, and young ladies, you must wear a dress or a skirt. Please, no sneakers or blue jeans. For today's lunch, we're having hamburger, french fries, pears, and a chocolate chip cookie. Have a great day. Cafeteria, please. Brucie, what are you doing? Brucie, stop! Suzy, come here! Take this to the office, please. You wait right here, young man, till I decide what I'm going to do with you. What are you laughing at? No, no, no, no, you are not touching me with that thing. What did you think was going to happen, Brucie? First, the incident from earlier. Now, you insist on disturbing the class. I have tried and tried, but you won't listen. Now turn around and put your hands on the wall. No, no, you can't make me! Let's go to the office. This isn't fair. Boy, you really did it today. Did what? Got caught. I don't know about you sometimes. You don't need to rub it in. So what're you gonna do? I'm gonna become president. No, silly. That's not what I meant. But you could, you know. You could, if you really wanted. I mean, you would have to work at it. My parents told me you can do anything, if you put your mind to it, and you're no different. Well, I don't know about that. Pat, my foster mom for a couple of years said that everyone has a different purpose and a different path, and everyone has different genes. The necessary genes to do what they're destined to do. Wow, I never thought about it like that. Well, it makes sense. If someone's no good at math, it isn't likely that they'll grow up to be an accountant, but everyone has to learn what they're equipped to do or what they can do and that's what they can grow up to be. See, you are smart, Brucie. So, what is it you think can do or wanna be? I told you already, president. Boy. You must really think you have some good genes. Yeah, I do have some good jeans. That has to be the least funny joke I've ever. I'm still holding you to your promise. Promise, what promise? Yeah, I wonder. You know exactly what promise I'm talking about. Why don't you go to church with me on Sunday? Fine, I'll go. Really? I'm holding you to it. See ya. Bye. Tiberius, that's him, right over there. Man, touch me again! Anyway. So that's the one you picked out, huh? We've been watching him for a while. We think he's a good fit. All right, same background as the others? Oh, yeah. He's been in and out of more foster homes than I can count. Yeah, but that don't necessarily mean nothin'. In and out a few you say, huh? Quite a few. Yeah, that's what's up. There ain't gonna be no man hunt, 'cause ain't nobody gonna even miss him. Yeah. We still need somebody to cut and run the product, though. But him? Yeah, he gonna work out just fine. All right, make it happen. You bet. Suzy, how are you today? I'm fine, thank you. Hi. Hey. Hey. You made it. Well, I said I would, didn't I? Yeah, I know you did. Well, we have a few minutes before we start and I wanted to show you around. I'm good with that. Cool. Hi, Suzy. Hi. How are you? Good to see you. I'm good. Excellent, who's this? This is Brucie, he goes to school with me. Hi, welcome, glad to have you here today. Thank you. Have a seat. Okay, guys, today we're gonna start off with just a short lesson. From there we're gonna move into the trivia contest that we talked about last week. You'll catch up, don't worry. Who remembers what we were talking about? Jimmy? David and Goliath. David, that's excellent, very good. So if you remember, David's father Jesse sent him to be with his brothers who were preparing to do battle with the Philistines. Anybody remember what he took with him? Suzy? Bread and cheese. Yes, that's it. So when David got there, Goliath came out and challenged David's people. And David, who was but a youth, a young boy, he said The President of the United States of America! I would like to welcome everyone who came out today, and those of you who are watching by television. I wish to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who has supported us in the midst of what you know is a heated campaign, which is ultimately why we won the election is because of your vote. Now, you know it has been our promise all along that the great country that we live in shall realize its full potential, but in order to do that we must empower the people. Now, homelessness and unemployment shall be a thing of the past and division in the workplace shall be nonexistent. It took Goliath's own sword and he takes the victory. Okay, well that's it. Time for church, you guys have a great day. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Thank you for coming. Trust is the cornerstone of every successful relationship. Proverbs chapter three verses five and six say, "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart." "Lean not unto thine own understanding." "In all thy ways, acknowledge him" "and he will direct thy paths." It is our great hope that God is who he says he is. We often hold fast to this hope when we're anticipating the life to come, but we also hold fast to this hope when we're talking about things that deal with this life as well. In this life, we have the same hope, that God is exactly who he says he is. We often put our hope and trust in God with the anticipation that he won't fail us. When we fail, we cry out for him because we have hope that he will hear, that he will answer, that he will rescue, that he will provide. Why do we call on God? Because we know he is always faithful. We know that our God is trustworthy. We know that we can trust him because he will not betray us, he will not lie to us, he will not leave us, and he will not forsake us, and we know that he never changes. We all have that friend that we know is trustworthy. And we know that if we go to them, will be there for us. If we need something, they'll help us. They won't betray us, they won't lie to us. These are the attributes that we expect from God and depend on from God. But the question I wanna ask you today is, what does God say when he sees you? How do you become a person that is absolutely trustworthy and reliable, dependable? How do you get to be a person that God can trust? It takes a step of faith, and in a moment, I'm going to open this altar to everyone who would like to put your faith and trust in Jesus Christ as savior, not just for this lifetime, but for eternity. I'm going to invite everyone here in this congregation that would like to receive Jesus as their savior to make your way to this altar. We'll pray, God will hear, God will answer, and your life will be changed. Wanna go down, Brucie? I don't know, people are watching. Since when do you care what other people think? I don't know. I can tell you want to, come on, I'll go with you. Okay. God, I come to you, a sinner in need of a savior. I believe Jesus is the son of God and died on the cross for the forgiveness of sins. I've committed sins and I ask your forgiveness. I declare and decree that I will live for you as you show me how. In Jesus' name, I pray. Amen. Hey, kid! Can you tell me how to get to. Herb's garage on Livingston, I think? Yeah, sure, that's easy, you've just gotta head down Get in. Now. Get in the car, man. You heard him, get in. Man, Ti, we pulled that off like a boss, baby, we pulled Man, get him put away. Come on, young Bruce. Hey, we're your family now. All right, check it out. This was your predecessor's, now it's all yours. We'd like to file a missing persons report. Of course. Please, sit down. I know you. Yeah, I remember you from the night we found Brucie. The baby we found on the steps. Yeah, believe me, I remember. I've dealt with Brucie on and off over the years. He's been in about 17 foster homes. I believe that may be a record. In fact, that's why we're here. He's the one that's missing. Oh, no, you're kidding. I hate to hear that. You know, I've been hoping and praying things would've turned out differently for him. No, unfortunately not. In fact, we don't know where he is, if he's run off or what. Either way, we have to assume the worst, and that's why we're here. Of course. Is Chief Angelus still here? Oh, Gabe? No, he's been gone for some time. No, he left for some kind of special assignment. I have no idea what that was about, but uh, he acted like it was some kind of top secret thing. Haven't seen him since. So, Brucie, when was he last seen? This morning, when he left for church. He's been missing since this morning, and you're just now reporting? Well, you need to know Brucie. He, uh, isn't one to come straight home, and, well, for all it takes to get him to stay there, he's always on the go. So does he just kind of do as he pleases? No, no, we let him have freedoms. He's 14, and he can go visit his friends, and as long as he checks in before supper and is home... So when he didn't check in after church, we called our caseworker and she suggested waiting to see if he came home for supper, but he didn't. So, I called her back and I just knew something is wrong. Who was he last seen with? Suzy, he went to church with her. It's a girl he goes to school with. Does he go to church often? No, this was his first time. Suzy had been asking him for a long time to go to church. He was just so happy and he was nice this morning, and it doesn't make sense, you know? Suzy brings out the best in him. Do you know how I can get a hold of Suzy? Yes, Brucie had her number written down and I already called her house and talked to her parents today. They asked Suzy if she knew where Brucie was, but um, she last seen him leaving church. You don't have that number on you, do you? Yes, I do. Great, thank you. So, Brucie. Was he given a last name? Yes, the state gave him the name Bruce Stern. Kind of appropriate. Hmm. I suppose. It could be assumed that he's been through a lot. You know, it's hard on a kid, being moved from one environment to another, from one influence to another, and it's not always the best influence. Do you have a recent photo? Yes. Here you go. Well, I'll put out an all points bulletin. If he shows up or if you hear anything, contact me immediately. Will do. Yes, sir. All right, listen up! Anybody seen Reggie? Oh, so ain't nobody seen him? Well, look, if y'all see Reggie, tell him to come see me. Y'all got that? Good. Hey, let's go, young Bruce. Where are we going? We've got some work to do. All right, little Brucie. Shut up, do exactly what I tell you, and you might not get hurt. Now, you're gonna get out the car, and walk over to that corner over there. A guy gonna come over to you and he gonna say, "Look like a nice night." You gonna say, "No, it look like snow." He gonna hand you a package and you gonna hand him this, and then you gonna walk back over to the car. That's it. You got it? Yeah, I think so. Man, do you or don't you? Bruce, you have to be sure. You can't mess this up. Remember, "No, it looks like snow." It rhymes. Man, get him out of my car and put him to work. Hey, remember, "No, it looks like snow." It looks like a nice night. Man, don't give it to me, give it to him! Good job, Bruce. Oh, yeah, we good. Good job. Hey. Hey. Do you want something to eat before we go to bed? No, no, thank you. Okay, well, um, if you don't want something to eat, we should probably gets some sleep. We've got Taylor's game later today, remember? I remember. Hey, um... Do you remember about 14 years ago when I found the baby outside the precinct? Yeah. Yeah, um, what was his name, it was, uh... Bruce? Yeah, it was Bruce. Bruce. Well, he's resurfaced. Resurfaced? Yeah, the same caseworker came in tonight with a foster mom to file a missing persons report, and it's Bruce. Oh, my gosh. Yeah, apparently he's been in and out of 17 different foster homes. Some kind of record. So, I guess he's a bit of a problem. Probably easily influenced to being in that kind of environment. You know, that, that sounds a lot like being in jail. You've got these people in there for minor offenses and they end up so much worse off because of the influences they encounter there. Yeah. Some of those places are, yeah, they're pretty awful. Yeah, I know. There's good ones too, like the Ramsey's, and I guess he didn't get that lucky. Poor kid didn't even stand a chance. So are there any leads on where he could be or anything like that? No, no, we don't have that. We don't have anything solid, but I've put an APB out. Hopefully he turns up. Listen. I know how much stuff like this affects you and I know that you get attached. Hey. I need you to not take it personally, okay? I know. With Bruce it's... You know, I was there from the beginning, you know? I know. Let's go to bed, okay? You're gonna need your energy if you wanna keep up with Taylor and the team tomorrow, okay? Yeah. Come on. What's up, Reggie? Hey, Boss. You kick it at the crib today? Boss, I was at the bone yard looking at these rides. Okay, all right, so they have any? Huh? Cars, man, rides! At the bone yard! Man, what's up with you, where your head at? You know what, they have a red TBird, and they got a Chevy. All right, TBird and a Chevy, huh? Yeah. Well, they've been there for three days. I know what they just got in. Well, I mean Let's just cut to the chase! If you was at the bone yard, then why we see you on the corner of Third and Main? Third and Main? Yeah, yeah, yeah! You been made, stool pigeon! Now what? Look, Boss, I didn't tell them nothin' about this place. See, that's good, that's real good. Listen, the cars is one thing, the drugs is another. But Brucie? Man, we're crossing the line. Somebody has to make a stand, and you know what? I ain't standing for it. You ain't gonna stand for nothin' ever again. What, come on, man, really? Come on. It's me. Hey, let's just get this money and get outta here real quick. Here he is right here. Hey, what up, Brucie? What's up, Bruce? Got that for you. You didn't get that from me. You didn't see us. Have a good night. Ty, it don't matter what we do, man. We ain't making no money off these pills. Man, 'cause I keep telling you, man, them pills is for little girls. What's moving out there on the block is that hard right there, all right? That's what we need to focus on. You right on that. Good job, young Bruce. Mommy's home! Troy, you okay? No, he's good! Seth, come on, come on, come on! Don't shoot, man. Shut up! I'm not with them! God, I wanna shoot you so bad, but I don't need excess baggage. Seth, let's go, the cops are coming, man! You're lucky the hit was for Tiberius, John, and his goons outside. I suggest you get out of town, and you never let me see you again, you got me? Let's go, come on! I know you. I know you. I see you, Satan. This one does not belong to you. He's ours. He's mine. No, you are the lie. I know you. I know you. I know you. You look like him. You look like him. Inside. That stuff you put in your veins, that's not you! That's the lie. No, you look like him, that's the lie! He take a piece of himself and put it inside you! Yes, inside. Inside, yes. You look like him. You look like him. You look like him. Inside, inside. You look like him. Yes, please, breathe with him. Breathe, breathe with him. Breathe with him, breathe with him. Yes, breathe with him. You look like him. You look like him. I know you. I wanna talk to you guys about choices today. Life is about choices. I want you to think about the choice that the Father made for you and I, to send the son, Jesus Christ, to die for us. And I also want you to think about the choice that Jesus had to make in going to Calvary and shedding his blood for you and I. Life is about choices, but none greater than the choice you and I have to make today. Will we make Jesus our master? And now it's your turn. You have a choice to make. Hey, buddy, you up? You up, buddy? Do you have any guns, do ya? Nice painting. Yes, it is. What do you think? I'll take it. Thank you. What can I do for you? How much for the painting? Hey, Bruce, how's your week been? Imagine seeing you here. Yeah, blackjack table's calling my name. Well, please don't let me hold you up. Hey, tonight's my night. You know that guy? Bruce? Yeah, he's a regular here. Bruce, you say? Mmhm. Thank you. Brucie? It's Bruce. Suzy? I can't believe this. Aren't you a sight for sore eyes? Hey, where did you go? I mean, nobody knew if you'd been taken or even if you were alive. All the above, I believe. Brucie. I mean, Bruce. Sorry. You can call me Brucie. Man, it seems like only yesterday. Yeah. Takes you back. Yeah, it does. I can, I can still remember my mom yelling upstairs to me that day. Hey, Suzy? Yeah? Do you know where Brucie is? I just got a call that he didn't come home after church today. I don't know. Suzy! Suzy! I remember running out there, looking for you, but I couldn't find you. You were really gone. Bruce, I never thought I would see you again. So what's going on with you? I mean, this is the last place I would expect to see you, out of all people. It's funny you should ask. I actually worked here. It was then that I saw firsthand what addiction does, whether it be drugs, alcohol, or gambling. So I started an outreach called No Excuses. It helps people get free and take authority over their situation. So you actually worked here? Yeah, I mean I had to survive, and this was the only place hiring at the time. Gosh, I prayed every day that I wouldn't have to do anything that went against my faith and God made a way. So you don't work here anymore, then? No, no, it was my mission field and it still is, but, you know, after starting the ministry, it just, I don't know, I didn't feel good about it. It just wasn't sending the right message to those I was helping. So what's your mission tonight, then? Well, I was looking for a girl named Alicia who's in the program, I think she relapsed. She wasn't at home, so that pretty much leaves this place. You do realize it's not a coincidence we ran into each other tonight, don't you? Oh, boy, you haven't changed a bit, have ya? Well, it could be that you're my mission. Believe me, you don't wanna go down that road. Pretty rough, huh? Yeah, I was pulled from the street against my will and Bruce, how did it happen, I mean, I saw you at church, we said goodbye and that was it. Do you feel like talking about it? Well, let's just say I didn't get very far. Maybe a couple blocks, that was it. A car pulled up and, Tiberius, the leader, he was there. And he asked me for directions to Herb's Garage. Yeah, I remember that place. Yeah, we all did, and so I didn't expect a thing. I walked right into it. He flashed a gun and pulled me in and that night they showed me what they wanted with me. Made me make my first drop and... The things they made me do. Unspeakable things. And maybe I didn't have a choice, at the beginning. Later on? I'm not so sure. Brucie, you don't have to be a product of your past. That's quite the sentiment you have there. You'd have better luck selling that to the greeting card company than you would me. Actually, I've been down this rough road with other people and I've seen them get free from their past and find a hope then a future. It doesn't happen overnight, but with some help And what? And you wanna make me one of your pet projects? I don't think so. Okay, I'm not saying that your life has to be like a greeting card. Very few are, but you don't have to let your past dictate your future or who you are. Nature versus nurture would argue with that one, too. Wouldn't it? Still smart as ever, aren't you? Hey, who you talkin' to? Yeah, I know. Look, you can bring psychology or science into this, but I still know you and aside from whatever they made you do or whoever they tried to make you become, that's not who you are. There's so much more for your life, Brucie, and I know that with God Enough with the intervention, okay? I've been down that road. Twice I gave God a chance, and it didn't go anywhere. Well, I better see if I can find Alicia. You gonna be around? Yeah. I have some unfinished business. It's good to see you this evening, Bruce. You too, Candy. 180 in! Good evening, sir. Thank you for being here. Thank you. Yes! Woo! Hello. I'm Gabe. Yeah? So? Would you like to make a small wager? I don't have anything left to wager. Oh, but you do. If you lose, you'll see all the things you've ever done. I lived through everything I've done. I don't figure where seeing it again would hurt. What do I get if I win? Untold riches. Let's do this. A cut of the cards. Takes all. Agreed? Agreed. Would you like to go first? No. No. Very well, I'll go first. Are you ready? There was another shooting down on Livingston. It seem like shots happen all the time now. Sometimes it even keeps me up at night. I gotta get out of this place. Yeah, me too, I'm not too far from there. Anyway, be careful out there. Thank you, have a good night. Give me your money! Okay, okay, okay. Give me your money or I'll kill ya! I don't wanna die, please don't kill me! Give me your money! Okay, okay, okay. I wanna talk to you all about choices today. Already since you woke up this morning, you have made a lot of choices. You made the choice to be here today, right? And so, choices are a big part of everything that we do. I want you to think about the choice that the Father made for you and I to send the son, Jesus Christ, to die for us. What am I doing here? Besides, what has God done for me? Shedding his blood for you and I. Oh, no, no! Don't you give her that baby. Why you looking at me like that? I told you we can't afford another mouth to feed! Give it to me, I'll take care of it. I'll dispose of it just like I said. I'll take care of it. You can't even get out of bed! "Take care of it." Get out! Go get your dope! Go get your fix! Hey, let's just get this money and get outta here real quick. Hey, what up, Brucie? What's up, Bruce? I got that for you. You didn't get that from me. You didn't see us. Have a good night. Don't shoot, man. Shut up! I'm not with them! God, I wanna shoot you so bad. Where ya going? You're lucky the hit was for Tiberius, John, and his goons outside. I suggest you get out of town, and never let me see you again, you got me? Let's go, come on! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, God. I'm sorry, forgive me. Forgive me, God. Forgive me. The deuce. It was the two times I walked away from you. Everyone back up, please. Back up, go about your business. Get out of here. Excuse me, sir? You all right? You're Bruce. Yeah. But how do you know? Because I've been praying for you. I've been praying for you your whole life. What? I will always watch over you. I gave this to you on the day you were born. Hey, Brucie, is everything all right? Untold riches. Untold riches. Hey, um... You think I could buy you a cup of coffee or something? I have some things I'd really like to tell you. Boy, do I have a story to tell you. Gabriel. Lucifer! I have a message for you, from the most high. You've been defeated. You no longer matter.
