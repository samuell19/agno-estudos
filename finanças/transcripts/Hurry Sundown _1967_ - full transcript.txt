When are you gonna start over there ? We can't blast over there. That's not our land yet. I thought we bought the whole tract 15 months ago. No, we took an option on Mrs. Warren's land over there. But that doesn't include the center strip with the two farms. Henry, when we agreed to buy your wife's land, you guaranteed... I know it, Mr. Elwell. We just been held up a bit on account of both those farmer boys been off fighting a war. One's back already, another one's due any day now. And I arranged to hear about it just as soon as he sets foot off the bus. Why don't you talk to the other one in the meantime ? I can't do that, Mr. Elwell. We have to give Rad McDowell the first chance to sell out. - Why ? - 'Cause he's white. The other place belongs to colored. Supposing neither one of them wants to sell ? Don't you worry about that, Mr. Elwell. One of them places belongs to a cousin of mine, and the other one to my wife's old colored mammy and her son. So you see, in a manner of speaking, it's all in the family. We can't wait forever, Henry. If the deal isn't wrapped up by the end of the month, we'll just have to drop our option on your wife's property and expand in the other direction. Here is my wife now, Julie. - How do you do ? - Sheriff Coombs is been very helpful. - Mr. Elwell. - Elwell. So nice meeting you at last, Mrs. Warren. I'm glad to see it isn't just a legend what they say about southern beauty. It's both a pleasure and a revelation for me too, Mr. Elwell. You see, down here we're brought up believing that all Yankees have horns and a tail. - Is that so ? - Cross my heart. You know, I was 10 years old before I learned that "damn" and "Yankee" were two separate words. Now how about stopping by the house for a nice, long drink ? I'd love to, but we've got three other places to visit before we call it a day. - Good- bye. - Good- bye. - Sheriff. - Mr. Elwell. - Henry. - Mr. Elwell. Hey, Rad ? Rad. Over here. Let me be the first to welcome you home. - Somebody meeting you ? - No, I figured I'd surprise them. Get in, I'll run you home. Come on, you sure as hell ain't gonna walk it. How's it look to you ? It changed any ? Yes and no. It all seems smaller. Sure it does, now you've seen them famous European cities and all. You'd never been more than 20 miles away before the war. Must've been pretty exciting, huh ? Depends on where you're looking from. From over there or over here. You look good, Rad, real good. And you look prosperous, Cousin Henry. Mighty prosperous. This ? Why this ain't even the ribbon on the package. Can't hardly call it a beginning. Quicker than you can think about it, we'll be going all the way from land poor to money rich. Sounds like a nice trip. - Did you hear about Riverside ? - Lou wrote me some. It's already the biggest thing ever to hit Colfax County. And before we're through, gonna be the biggest thing to ever hit Georgia. Riverside. To be completed in October. They made me the local manager. I'm in charge of this whole district. A lot different than the old days on the shrimp boats, huh ? I've seen to it you're gonna get cut a piece of the pie, too. - What pie is that ? - Why, the money-pie. Hell, boy, don't bother to thank me. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx I was glad to do it. Maybe you and me didn't always hit it off. But say what you will, blood is thicker than water. So I'm making sure you get took care of real good. Why '2 Well, you think you're going to be happy sinking back into the same old rut? Breaking your back trying to scratch a living out that little farm of yours ? No, sir. You'll want more. For them kids of yours, too. Especially for that Charles. He's a real go-getter! Spitting image of me when I was his age. Seems more like my son than my cousin. - Thanks. - Anyways... I sold the powers that be on the idea of buying your place for the exact same price they paid for Julie's land. $100 an acre. Even for that parcel that's no more than swampland. How 'bout that for horse trading ? - Well, I don't know. - What do you mean, you don't know ? When else do you think you're gonna get the chance to even see $5,000 ? Never, I reckon. But it ain't the kind of thing you decide on just like that. - I'd have to think on it. - You do that. Only don't go letting them have second thoughts. I'd better be getting along, Rad, I'm already late for church. You at church ? Why, it ain't even Sunday. - Things have changed around here. - No, not that much. It's just that Julie's cousin, Clem, is getting ordained today. Gonna be the new minister. Opportunity's knocking, Rad. Don't wait too long to answer the door. I'll think on it. Hey, Lou '2 Lou '2 Lou '2 - Something's ailing you, Reeve. - No, Mama. Well, something happened to change your mood since breakfast. You better than any of that radar they had out in the South Pacific. I don't know nothing about radar, but I know when something's plaguing my child. Rad McDowell done come back. I seen him down by the road, talking with his cousin. Henry Warren ? I bet he's after Rad to sell his place, just like he been nagging us. Why don't you go over there ? Ask Rad about it. The two of you have always been friendly. - When we was kids, maybe, not since. - Suit yourself. But soon as I'm up and about, I'm gonna pay me a call on Miss Julie. She'll know how to handle Mr. Henry Warren. The wife always knows the best ways to get around her man. Mama, you living in a dream. You can't trust no Miss Julie or no other white folks to watch out for us. We gotta start watching out for ourselves. I don't know what they done to you in that there army. Seems like you ain't got a kind word to say about nobody since you got back. You go away, you get to take a good long look at yourself. Your life, everything. It ain't so easy, after that, to fall back into old ways. - How you been, Mr. Warren ? - Fine, thank you, Deputy. Can't be all over and done with already. Can it, Judge ? Excuse me. Rad ! Rad ! I'd like to have died when I heard in town that you was back, and us not here to greet you. Don't fret, honey, don't fret. Honey, when we didn't hear nothing this morning, we figured you wasn't coming today. I went into town to the beauty parlor, so as I'd look pretty for you. You are the prettiest sight I ever did see. I never even got to the beauty parlor. It don't matter, honey. It don't matter one bit. Come here ! I'm home. Great God Almighty, I'm really home. If you hadn't invited the negress to attend, the whole incident could have been avoided. I couldn't very well refuse to give her communion, could I? Until you get them a pastor of their own, I'm their priest, too. If God in his wisdom saw fit to separate the races, who are we to question him ? Clem, I think you ought to work out some means of mollifying Judge Purcell. It doesn't do to start out in the ministry with one of your most important parishioners at odds with you. There's a lot more to it, Bishop. After that woman received, I passed the communion cup to the Judge. He spit into it. I was standing right there, and I didn't see it. It happened. If I was you, Clem, I wouldn't challenge the Judge on it. Let him just come around to you in his own good time. Otherwise, he might just say he didn't do it. Then where would you be ? In almost as awkward a position as I'll be if he expects to receive communion without asking forgiveness. - Come in. - Clem, it was just lovely. - Thank you, Julie. - And terribly impressive. I feel like I should start calling you Mr. De Lavery. I'm the same man I always was. Whatever that's worth. Morning, miss. Yeah ! Run down that hen ! Giddy-up ! Yeah ! All right, Charles, supper's ready, get to the table. Come on. Charles. Charles. Lord, we thank thee for all thy bounty. And most especially, for bringing us together again safe and sound. Amen. Excuse me, I'd like to talk to the Sheriff. - Bishop. - Delighted to see you again, Judge. - Thank you kindly. - You too, Miss Purcell. The pleasure's mine, Bishop. And this here's our daughter, Sukie. Judge, it looks like you're simply surrounded by beauty. Thank you. Mrs. Coombs, you are a sight for sore eyes. Sheriff, you're a good boy, always a good boy. Yes. Miss Julie, it's a pleasure to see you. - Hello, Julie. - Mrs. Purcell. I'm so glad you all could come to greet my cousin, Clem. Oh, no. Just a second, Sukie, I want you to meet the guest of honor. Well, I was just fixing to get a glass of punch. All in good time, sugar. Clem, there's some folks over here you haven't met yet. - Miss Julie, if you'll excuse us. - Why, Judge, I wouldn't think of it. But you saw how we was insulted, me and my womenfolk, by this... - This hot-headed cousin of yours. - Well, what was it he did ? Well, I'll tell you what he did. He passed me a cup which had just been pressed to the mouth of an old nigger woman. Now I ask you how you'd feel if someone was to do a thing like that to you, Miss Julie. Well, seeing as how I was breast-fed by a colored wet nurse, one of the finest women ever wore shoe leather, I think I'd manage to survive. This wasn't anything like that, no, sir. Let me tell you, this was nothing less than the leavings of a drunken, syphilitic, old nigger woman. I can't rightly blame her. No, she's obviously too far gone to know what she's doing. But I can, and I do, blame the man who had the audacity to pass that very same cup on to me. Judge, do you know this woman ? - Do you know her? - Well, not by name. Then how come you're so sure she's drunken and syphilitic and all? Unless, of course, you are specially qualified in those fields. We are leaving. Judge, she don't know what she's saying. Well, I know what I'm saying. And I'll tell you right here and now, no member of my family will ever set foot in St. Paul's as long as that man is pastor. - Papa, what about my wedding ? - There are other churches. Don't you worry your pretty little head, Sukie. Come on. Cousin Henry says the real smart men was the ones who managed to stay out of the army. That's something Cousin Henry knows a lot about. He says with four kids and all, you didn't have to go, neither. Is that so, Daddy ? A man's got to do what his conscience says is right. Cousin Henry didn't feel like he ought to go. And he's only got one kid. How come is that ? It just might be that Cousin Henry don't know what a conscience is, son. I'm glad that's over with. Thought you might feel the need of a little restorative. I thought it went pretty well, all things considered. - That so ? - Meaning ? Well, if I was you, I'd make mighty sure I didn't go through no red lights or get me any parking tickets. Leastways, not for the next couple of years. He came here, to my home and my party, with the sole purpose of insulting my guest of honor. My own kin. I think he got just what he deserved. There's my angel. - There's my lamb. - It ain't my fault, Mr. Warren. - He just wouldn't stay in his room. - Course he wouldn't, why should he ? You've been just as good as gold all afternoon. Haven't you, precious ? You don't want Mama to carry you ? Okay. There you go, sweetheart. Come on, honey. Stop, Colie, come on, sweetheart. Stop it. Sugar. Sugar, I told you, that's a no-no. Give me that ! Come on, honey. What did you have to do that for ? You know he can't stand to be yelled at. Now, sugar. Kissie. Can you take Colie up ? It's way past his bedtime. - No. - It's all right, sweetheart. I'm sorry. I guess we're all a bit over-tired. I'm glad we got this minute to ourselves. There's something I've been wanting to talk over with you all day. Riverside ? Rad McDowell come home this morning. Julie. He didn't jump at the idea of selling like I thought he would. Lord Almighty, but I'm sick of hearing about Riverside. Seems like that's all anybody has ever talked to me about. First my mama and daddy and now you. That land is all we got. When I think I once looked upon you as a way out of Riverside and all. I can be, honey. I will. Only, right now, we walking on eggs. Until we get Rad and Rose to sell. Henry, I'm not going out there and worry Aunt Rose. Now I thought I made that more than clear. You ain't gonna be worrying her. You're gonna be showing her the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Henry. That old woman was my mammy. And she loved me. There was a time when she was the only one in this whole world I knew really loved me. And I can't go against her. I just... I can't. All right, all right. If that's the way you feel, ain't no sense harping on it. You do understand, don't you, Henry ? Sure I do, sugar. What I don't understand is you setting that old darkie and her few little acres against me and your son. - Did she awaken ? - Didn't budge. She's gonna holler blue murder in the morning when she finds out she ain't bunking in with me no more. Well, a husband's got to have some rights. It was mighty nice of you, Rad. Holding your tongue at supper with Charles, I mean. I know it wasn't easy for you. I figured I'd try it your way. For a spell, anyways. Only, I don't aim to let him keep hanging around Cousin Henry. I think Henry has a real affection for him. I think he wishes Charles was his own boy. He's got a kid of his own. What's he want with Charles ? Colie ain't normal. He's nearly six years old and he can't say a solitary word. Folks say Henry is to blame for that. That kind of thing ain't nobody's fault. Maybe, maybe not. All I know is what folks say. - What's that ? - Nearly four years ago... Didn't I write you about that ? When Julie's daddy was dying, and she had to go up to the hospital in Atlanta with him, there wasn't anybody to stay with little Colie except for Henry. This was just about the time the whole Riverside thing was getting started. Henry was always running after them, trying to make a deal for Julie's land. Then, this day I'm talking about, some of the top men come down from Atlanta and New York. Well, Henry wasn't about to miss out on that. The thing was, though, he couldn't find anybody to stay with little Colie. Although they say he did try. Anyhow, I guess he figured on only being gone an hour or two. So he took a length of clothesline and just tied that little feller into his crib. - Jesus. - That ain't the half of it. Instead of being an hour or two, he was gone for almost the whole day. And that child's been peculiar ever since. - What did Julie say ? - I don't know. I hear she don't admit anything's wrong with the boy. Certain things are just better left to experts. It's Colie. - I better tend to him. - Kissie's up there with him. It'll be done faster than we can talk about. You just hold on now, Rad. You wanna burn the place down ? Lou, you can stall all you want to. Only, I'm gonna be right here waiting. Darling, what's the matter? Did I say something ? Or do something ? What? What's eating you ? Here I had it all pictured, how it was gonna be when you come home. Me with a beauty parlor wave and all gussied up to kill. I even had it in mind to buy some brand-new sheets. You done dropped out of the blue, and nothing's the way I planned it. Honey, I wouldn't change a bit of it. I look like I'm still working as a welder. I do. Wait. Maybe I can help you out there. I brung you this, all the way from Paris, France. Well, I never... - But... ls it all right ? - Like it was made for you. I never had anything so pretty in all my born days. That oughtn't to be, Lou. We're still young, both of us. Now's the time we ought to be enjoying ourselves. Getting out and doing things, all of us. There's got to be more to life than just working a farm till you drop in your tracks. - Else nothing makes no sense. - What's biting you, Rad ? I don't know. Seems like I got me a fever. A yen to go places while there's still time. - What places ? - Lots of places. We got us a whole world to choose from. I knowed it. I felt it all along. - You ain't glad to be back. - Glad ? Well, that don't half describe it. Where are we gonna be while you're hightailing it off to them places ? Right there with me, Lou. We can get us a trailer until we settle on someplace permanent. No. Rad McDowell, you think I done broke my nails and stooped my back, working day and night keeping up this place, raising them kids in there, plus doing a full day's work at the plant just so as you could sashay back here and sell it? - Honey, if we got... - We got this land, Rad. Well, that's more than a start. It's all ours now, paid up free and clear. Land lasts. You take care of it, it'll take care of you. Besides, you ask around. Things is changed. They gonna be changing a lot more, too, before they're finished. It could be that this place is gonna be worth a lot more than $5,000. Now, do you think Henry Warren is studying how to do us a good turn ? Okay, Lou, I won't go doing nothing unless you agree with it. Deal ? Now, you put this damn thing on, will you ? You're the only one, Lou. The only one in the whole wide world for me. I ain't gonna ask you no questions, Rad. I just want you to know, there ain't never been nobody else. Darling, I... Look. There was times when I'd get to feeling so low, and I had started walking through some city, and meet some gal, and we'd start talking... I don't want to hear about it. Not now, not ever. One thing you got to hear. There ain't nobody nowhere meant a thing to me. It ain't never been good for me except with you, Lou. I mean that. You recollect that motto on my grandma's sampler? It said, "Actions speak louder than words." Rad... I missed you so. Just two minutes. Hotter than a two-dollar pistol, ain't ya ? Henry. What do we pay Kissie for if she can't keep him quiet? Henry, when he gets like this, I'm the only one he'll... Come on, Henry, let go. Henry, let go. - Let go ! - What about me ? If it weren't for you, he might not be crying. I'm through letting you wish it all off on me. You hear? Ain't never been nothing like that on my side of the family. You just take a look at Rad's kids. Any one of them. Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and smart as whips. Are you through ? Just don't think I'm gonna sit here like some piece of machinery waiting for you to come back and turn me on, you hear? Henry. Henry. There's Reeve Scott, Daddy. Hi, Rad. Can you give me a lift into town ? Sure. - How's it feel to be home ? - Okay, I guess. You selling out to your Cousin Henry ? What's it to you ? He's playing us off against each other. You sellout, he cuts me off from the river. I sell out, he cuts you off from the road. - There's another thing. - Yeah ? Ain't no sense in staying on here unless we can make it pay. That's for sure. I figure we must lose a third of what we plant each year on account of flooding or dry spells. At least. Why can't we blast out irrigation ditches and keep our whole crop ? That's what Riverside's done. Riverside's geared for that. We ain't. Know what they trained me for in the army ? Demolition work. Hell, man, I blasted roads through mountains and turned jungles into airfields. - What's a little ditching after that ? - You go ahead on and do it then. Are you kidding ? Ain't a storekeeper in all of Georgia would sell me as much as a firecracker. Suppose we team up, you do the buying, I'll do the blasting. - I'll think on it. - We ain't got much time. We ought to have them dug before we start planting. - I said I'd think on it. - Well, what's there to think about? Afraid of what folks might say ? - No. - Sure. - Look, I said no, didn't I ? - Sorry, I didn't mean to push you. My wife and kids got to live in this town. You better let me off here. I don't want to embarrass you none by having folks see you riding me through town. It just goes to show you, you can't be nice to a nigger, else he takes advantage. I don't like that kind of talk, Charles. But them things Reeve said, they don't mean we ain't moving to California. California ? Now, whatever gave you that idea ? It's just something Cousin Henry said. Well, the next time Cousin Henry comes snooping around, you just tell him to keep his nose out of our affairs, you hear? Well, Vivian, I didn't know you were back. I didn't know you were. If I come back to school, can I have you for my teacher? Sure, if you could make it into fourth grade. Forget the whole thing. - I'm looking for your grandpa. - He'll be back in a minute. - How's your mother, Reeve ? - She's pretty sick. I'm sorry to hear that. - When you get to be her age... - How old do you think she is ? Maybe 72, 73. She's gonna be 54, her next birthday. With the way she's been feeling lately, I don't think she's gonna make it. I don't know what I'm gonna do without her. Survive. People can survive anything. Isn't that awful hard, Vivian ? ls that what living in New York does to folk ? That's what living does to folks. New York or anyplace else. Reeve, why didn't you ever answer any of my letters ? All during the war I wondered about you. What was the use ? You wrote me you'd fallen for some guy in New York. Why, Reeve. - Good to see you, son. - Hi there, Professor. Maybe you can help me talk some sense into Vivian here. This innocent, old country teacher could outsmart any con man in Harlem. - Is that so ? - I came home for a short visit... And the next thing I knew, he had me teaching school again. And now he's asking me to sign up for next year. This is your home, this is where you belong. You never got sick when you were living here. I wasn't sick in New York. I just needed a change. But I can't see myself spending the rest of my life here. Somehow, Georgia isn't my idea of the promised land. - You talk to her, Reeve. - Why me ? Because she has answers to all of my arguments. Well, then I don't see how I can be a match for her. - Giving up without a fight ? - I figured that's what you're doing. I mean, just saying how tough things are down here ain't gonna cure them. If we want it better, we gotta make it better. Nobody's gonna do it for us. That's sort of what they had to do in the original promised land, wasn't it? He's got you there, Vivian. Anyway, what I came to see you about, Professor, was to ask your advice. Henry Warren's been after my mama to sell our place to Riverside. We don't aim to sell. This here's the original bill of sale my great-grandpa, Old Jonas B., got when he bought our place at auction. Have you checked to see if there's a copy of this on file in the courthouse ? - You know they wouldn't let me. - It's dated 1866. Maybe the file copy got lost when the old courthouse burned down in '76. If it did, this is the only copy. Would you mind if I kept this in my safe ? You must be reading my mind ! You think I ought to look for a lawyer ? That would take some doing. - I'd like to see you again. - I don't think we ought to, Reeve. - Why not? - It wouldn't be fair to you. I'm not even sure it would be fair to me. Well, you're the teacher. - Hello, Mr. Warren. - Hi there, Ada. - Why, Henry Warren. - Eula. Vernon is out tending to his roses. Don't you forget to say hello to Sukie before you leave. I won't. - Judge. - Henry ? I just come by to apologize for that little to-do over at my place. You don't owe me any apology, Henry. It's others in your family that do. Papa, have you forgotten you're driving me to Nancy Doakes' for the shower they're giving me ? - I can take her, Judge, if you like. - You're an angel, Henry. - Is Julie going ? - No, she ain't. Guess she's afraid you'd outshine her, you pretty thing, you. See, first she insults me, then my daughter. It don't seem to me to be such a great burden for her to attend a little shindig in Sukie's honor. Well, it's our boy, Judge, he ain't too well today. I think that your son's ailment is mighty convenient for Julie Ann. - That ain't like you, Judge. - Well, look at the facts, man. It keeps her from being Sukie's matron of honor, or attending any of our little festivities. But it don't stop her from giving parties and what all for that nigger-loving cousin of hers. Well, you see, Judge, it ain't just our boy. I thought as much. Now, on top of him, she's all upset these days on account of the trouble we've been having with Rose Scott. - With who ? - Rose Scott, her old colored mammy. She's a mighty sick old nigger, and my Julie, she takes these things pretty bad. Then, too, there's all this foolishness over her land. - What land ? - The land that she... Rose lives on. It's Colfax land, everybody knows that. Only Julie's family let old Rose live there free and clear. As long as she kept up the taxes. Now, with Rose fixing to die, Julie would like her to sell the land to Riverside. For how much ? I guess they might go as high as 2,000. High enough for the estate to pass through my court for probate. Yeah, come to think of it, I guess that it will. Then, with any kind of a title dispute in question, you know better than to come to my house, trying to prejudice my judgment. I may not have the same glorious family tree as your high and mighty wife, but one thing I do pride myself on, and that is my integrity. I'm truly sorry, Judge. I'd never have brought it up if I thought you'd take offense. Now, when this old nigger woman dies... What'd you say her name was ? - Rose Scott. - Yeah, Rose Scott. When she dies, if her kinfolk can prove title, and I very much doubt that they can... You have no idea what I have to put up against. No, these darkies never have any papers, no birth certificates, no deeds, no wills, nothing. Anyway, if they can prove title, there's nothing I can do about it. But if they can't... Henry, my little Sukie has got her heart set on having Julie Ann as her matron of honor. Yes, I do know that, Judge. And I got my heart set on giving her whatever she wants. Yeah, but with you moving the wedding off to Bay City... Julie sets a lot by her cousin, Clem. Well, that's your problem, isn't it, Henry ? So, let's see what you can do about it, huh ? - I'll do my best, Judge. - Do more than that, Henry. Do more than what? Just a little wedding present for you, dear. Something Henry's going to arrange. I'll see if I can't get it out of him on the way to the shower. - Bye- bye, Papa. - Bye, dear. - You have a good time. - I'll try. Yes, sir. Seems like old times, riding off with you, Henry. - You want somebody to hear? - They wouldn't believe it, darling. I hardly do myself. Let me, Henry. Been too long a time since I started your motor. Boy, you really are something, Sukie. Cut it out now. Sugar, we ain't never gonna get anywhere, lessen I start your motor. Isn't this a good place, Henry ? It's a good place, but is it a good idea ? My, you've gotten cautious of late. Didn't used to be this careful. You wasn't engaged then. I don't feel all that engaged. Besides, you always did make me feel funny. You sure you know what you're doing ? I ought to. Done it often enough before, haven't we ? What about Howard ? Howard's a nice, dull boy with lots of nice, dull money. And I aim to make him a nice, dull wife. Until the wedding, don't I have the right to take my fun while I can ? Welcome home, sugar. It's nice to be back. Julie, honey, open up. It's me. Julie, open this door, you hear? I know you're in there. You don't open this damn thing, I warn you, I'm gonna kick it down. Don't you come in here. Don't you touch me. No. Stop it. No. Stop it. Mama, what are you up to now ? You don't think I'm gonna let my Miss Julie find me in my nightgown ? - She coming here ? - Done sent me word this morning. Mama, Miss Julie's after something. You know Henry Warren put her up to coming out here. I ain't saying he didn't. But after I explains it to her, she's gonna fix things. Make him leave us alone. - And if she don't? - Then I'll say, we won't sell. Mama, in your whole life you ain't never said no to white folks. It won't come to that with my Julie Ann. You going to see that today. You gonna see how that child pay me heed. Lord Almighty. There she is. Shucks, and we thought it was white folks. Mind your manners, Reeve. Hello, Professor Thurlow. How you been keeping ? Tolerable, Rose, just tolerable. - And you ? - Right smart, thank you. - It's nice to see you again, Aunt Rose. - You married yet, Vivian ? You're wasting your time, Mama. She ain't studying to marry no farmer. - Is that so ? - Well, not this farmer anyway. Mama, she's here. I'd be obliged if the two of you would take this boy of mine out of here and keep him busy. We'll come back later. - Auntie Rose. - Julie Ann. - My Julie Ann. - Auntie Rose. And you done brought Colie. My, he's grown. Come along, Colie, say hello to Aunt Rose. Leave him be, child. Let him take his own time. Come on, let go, Colie. Come on, turn loose, precious. Turn loose. I better get these in water. I declare, Rose, I never saw Colie take to anyone like he does to you. Children know who loves them. Sometimes, Rose, I think you just about invented love. Least ways for me. Hush now, child, you'll be making me cry. Mind if I crochet while we talk ? Course not. What's that you're working ? It's an afghan. Like the one my Great Aunt Isabelle made, remember? Honey, why this afghan is elegant. I'm making it for you, Rose, with devotion in every stitch. For me ? Well, it's... It's only the tiniest little part of what I feel. - Hi there, Cousin Henry. - Hi. - Hi there, Lou. - Henry. - Rad home ? - No, he went into town. Charles. Mind if I wait for him ? - Suit yourself. - Hi there, Cousin Henry. - Look what I brought. - ls it for me ? Well, maybe. Let's see if you can use it. You and Rad made up your mind if you're gonna sell the place ? You're gonna have to talk to Rad about it, Henry. Okay. - I hope you folks don't wait too long. - What do you mean ? Something tells me our Reeve ain't gonna be so picky about making $5,000. You mean, you pay them as much as white folks ? I will if I have to. If you'll accept my deal real quick, I'll up my offer on your place to 7,000. - Rad will be right back, Henry. - Okay. Charles ? I kept meaning to come, Rose. You know that. - And Mr. Henry, how's he keeping ? - Fine, but always on the go. I never seem to see him anymore. - A man's got to work, child. - I know. Funny, isn't it? Papa nearly had a fit when I ran off and married Henry. Now it's Henry that's putting all the old Colfax land back together again. Doing what Papa dreamed of all his life. I'm happy things are working out for you. Did you hear Henry's made this marvelous deal with the Riverside people ? They're gonna buy up all the land Papa left me. Really '2 Henry's been working just as hard as can be to bring it about. And, well, just to show you how sweet he can be, just now he's got them to offer as much for your land as they're paying for mine. And he let me be the one to bring you the glad tidings. Is that why you called ? Aunt Rose, I was planning to come anyway. This week or next. I just couldn't wait to tell you. I mean, after all you've given me, finally I can give you something back. Honey, I got all I want. This is my home, this is our living. Tell that to Mr. Henry. You know how. Rose, you'd be much more comfortable in town. I know we can fix you up with Kissie's folks. And I'd be able to stop by and see you just any time I please. No. - What do you mean "no"? - We ain't selling. Now, Rose darling, now I know how you feel. But there's not a blessed thing you can do about it. This is progress, Rose. You think the 20th century can stand still just 'cause you wanna hang on to a few little acres ? That ain't my Julie talking. Sounds more like Henry Warren. Of course this is a big opportunity for Henry. But it's my one chance, too, Rose. If Henry can make good of this, maybe he'll settle down. We might even have more children. Aunt Rose, in a manner of speaking, it's my future I'm asking you for. - It's my life. - I ain't selling. I ain't selling our land, you hear? Rose darling, you know just as plain as plain, this here is Colfax land. This is my land, and it always has been. Now we made it over to your folks during the war. But that was just for appearance sake, to keep it out of Yankee hands. And, since then, we let you work it in exchange for your keeping up the taxes and all. But there hasn't ever been any question about who was the rightful owner. - That's a lie. - Rose. After the war was over, the Yankees seized all this land hereabouts. And my grandpa, after just getting freed, he done hired himself out as slave labor. Doing things you couldn't even get a chain gang for. And he put that money aside. And when this piece come up at public auction, he bid it in at $200. And that's the God's honest truth. And well you know it. Auntie Rose. Auntie Rose. Auntie Rose. Reeve ! Reeve ! Somebody, help ! Reeve, she's been taken real bad. Mama ? Mama ? It's Reeve, Mama. I'm here. I don't know, it just came over her, suddenly. Vivian, can you go for the doctor? Colie. Stop, Colie, stop it. Julie ? Make her leave. What? Get well real quick, Aunt Rose, you hear? Reeve, when she comes around, you tell her to forget what I said. You tell her she can stay on here in peace as long as she lives. You've got my sworn oath. Come on, Colie. Will you tell her she can stay ? Make her hear. Come on. Henry, Henry. - What's wrong, sugar? - Henry. Why are you crying ? You'll be all right. - Is there anything I can do ? - No, she'll be all right. Henry, it was just awful. Calm down, honey, let me drive you on home. I told her everything about Riverside, just like you said. But before we could settle anything she had a terrible attack. Hi, Rad. You gonna be home later ? I might stop by. Look what Cousin Henry got me. I don't know what my plans are, Henry, but they don't include you. Rad, you best hear what Henry has to say. We ain't selling out, and that's final. You just run along home. - Take your toys with you. - Those were a present for Charles. Charles got a ball and glove of his own. What'd you tell him that for ? I ain't got no ball and glove. Henry Warren ain't buying nothing for this family. Or from us neither. Don't cry, darling. Your lovely, pretty little face is gonna get all ugly. - It's just us now. - Now, now, now. You don't wanna be all puffy and everything, do you ? Sukie, honey. Honey, what's wrong ? Papa. Sukie, Sukie. Sukie, dear... Sukie, Sukie, lovey ? What in hell is going on around here ? Well, might you ask ? Well, lam asking. ls she sick or something ? Sick ? Heartbroken is more like it. At Howard ? Has Howard done something to her? Much, much closer to home. You done something to her. Now, Eula, don't try my patience. I've had me a hard day today. - I'm in no mood for playing games. - Very well. Very well. Well, now, it looks like there isn't gonna be a single, solitary person at Sukie's wedding outside of the immediate family. - What? - Well, now, what'd you expect? Getting on your high horse and threatening the minister. And moving the wedding to Bay City. You think that the folks in this town are gonna turn on a Colfax cousin ? - You mean they've been declining ? - No. But they have not been accepting neither. And Sukie's been getting some mighty evasive answers when she inquires. Nobody's accepting ? None of the quality folk. I never, darling Eula. - What can we do ? - What can we do ? Well now, there's nothing we can do. You made the trouble, now you find a cure! Eula, I can't just back out. The whole town heard me say it. What do you think is gonna happen come next election if I was to go back on my word ? I don't see why that should bother you. You never carried the town. And if it wasn't for the back country folk, you'd still be clerking in your uncle's store. Sukie, Sukie, sugar. Eula, it's gonna be fine. - Sukie ? - Eula, I'm gonna... Reeve ? Reeve ? Yes, Mama ? I was wrong. I was wrong. Mama, whatever you done, you did it because you thought it was right. Don't fret yourself about it, please. I was a... I was a white folks' nigger. I was. I was. You've got to learn from my mistakes. You've got to fight. You've got to. - I will, Mama. - You've got to. I will. Swear to me. Swear. I swear, Mama. Ain't gonna be easy. But you'll know, at the end. You won't have this agony. This taste of bitterness and gall. Easy, Mama, please. I'm passing out of this life, Reeve. In these last minutes, you know what I feel most of all ? Anger. Yes, anger and hatred. Not so much at them for what they done to me. But at myself for letting them. No, helping them do it. And I grieve. I truly grieve for this sorry thing that has been my life. Mama ? Mama ? Henry Warren, you are going to spoil me rotten. - I swear you will. - Yes, ma'am. I don't remember ever being so hungry. Promise you'll still love me when I'm big and fat? I can think of a few exercises to keep you in shape. Henry ! You are depraved. Making your own wife blush before 6:00 in the morning. Got some papers here for you to sign, honey. - Now ? - No time like the present. I declare, Henry, you are a pest when it comes to business. - What are they ? - Eviction notice for the Scott place. - I told you... - Slow down a bit. Look, they're not even dated, see ? They ain't been signed by the court or nothing. And I swear to you by everything holy, they ain't leaving my safe while Rose draws breath. Then I don't see why I have to sign them right this very night. Sugar, what kind of bastard are you gonna call me if I come running to you to sign these the day that old woman passes on ? I never thought of that. Here. All three copies. - This is the right thing to do, Henry ? - It's the only thing, honey. Hey, Reeve. Did I wake you ? Good. Listen, I've been thinking things over. About the other day, I think maybe you've got something there about us making our places pay. And to hell with what folks say. Improving our land's what counts. So, I brung you a loaf of Lou's bread and a jar of her damson plum jelly. If you'll go make us a pot of coffee, we can patch things up and get down to business. Here. And I hope you choke on it. You uppity black bastard. - Rad, wait. - What for ? More sass ? No, it's just... Rad, my mama just now died. She was a real good woman, your mama. If there's a heaven, she's there this very minute. I hope so, Rad, 'cause she had enough of hell right here. - Morning, Reeve. - Morning, Reverend. I wanted to give you this for the building fund. You don't have to. Maybe you'd rather wait a bit. No, sir. This is the way my mama wanted it to be. She's been putting money by for the new church ever since I can remember. - I'll announce it after the service. - She'd like that. - Morning, Reverend. - Sheriff. - Hi there, Reeve. - Morning, Sheriff. We sure gonna miss Aunt Rose around here. Why, you know, she used to bring me a bushel of new potatoes every spring, just like clockwork. Appreciate your coming, Sheriff. Mama would have, too. Yeah, well, you see, Reeve, I really come to bring you this. - What is it? - They didn't waste anytime, did they ? Now, no hard feelings, Reeve. I'm just doing my job. What is it, Reeve ? Mrs. Warren claims the farm ain't rightly ours. This is a notice telling me to get off the land. Couldn't you have waited until after the funeral ? Well, you know how it is, Reverend. I'm a busy man. I ain't got time to go all the way out there if I don't have to. - It's outrageous. - I've been expecting it. And bad news don't improve with waiting. - Morning, folks. - Morning, Sheriff. How are things coming ? - Good morning, Vivian. - Good morning, Mrs. Warren. This is my husband. Reeve, I can't tell you how sorry I am. Is that a fact ? I'd have done anything for Aunt Rose. Anything in this world. If you mean that, you can just take yourself on out of here. - Reeve ? - Listen here, boy. We know you're grieving. But that don't give you leave to insult my wife. This here nigger, he told Julie he don't want her at the funeral. And this here nigger meant what he said. You can't stop me. He's Rose's next of kin, his wishes ought to be respected. Come on, sugar, no skin off our noses. Just as you say, Cousin Clem. I can't expect any better from a field hand like Reeve. But Clem ? After all I did for him ? Taking his side against the Judge. Miss Sukie Purcell has just got herself a matron of honor. That ought to fix Clem's wagon. And just to make sure folks don't miss the point, I'm gonna offer Sukie the loan of my mama's lace wedding veil. Anybody here ? Good morning, Judge. Up. up! - Sir? - Up on your feet. - Miss Ada, come on in here! - You want me, Judge ? - Who let this gal in here ? - Why, where'd she come from ? Get the Sheriff. What has come over you people ? Have you no sense of decorum ? Isn't there a trace of respect left in any of you ? - You answer me. - I'd be glad to, Judge. Which question would you like me to start with ? Yes, sir? This gal wandered right into my private office. - Hi, Vivian. - Hello, Sheriff. How come you know her? ls she some kind of habitual criminal ? Hell no, Judge. This here's Vivian. Professor Thurlow's granddaughter. Yes ? Well, I just caught her red-handed. - Stealing ? - No, sitting. - Sitting ? - Yes, sitting. Now, Vivian, you know better than that. Suppose you tell the Judge why you come in here in the first place. I need permission to do some research in your records for a class I'm preparing on local history. Someone from your school board will have to get you an authorization from the county commission for that. Now, Judge, you're just being modest. We all know who has the last word around here. I don't know what harm it would do, Judge. And when we get to more modern times, I do hope you'll come and talk to my class. Well, I'm a mighty busy man. Still, I suppose I could spare a few minutes. It would be my duty... I can't possibly tell you what it would mean to them. - Miss Ada ? - Yes, sir? Will you take Vivian here down to records, give her whatever she wants. You're such a perfect example of everything southern. We have the Judge's permission. Sure enough. All the records are in chronological order. Starting at the very back and ending up in the front row here. - Thank you. - Better take one of these. Things can get a mite dusty back there. Wouldn't hurt if you was to give them a lick and a promise. - Here's the list and my share. - We'll settle up later. Okay, I'll wait here. - Hey, Ozzie, how are you ? - Afternoon, Mrs. McDowell. - Hi, Ozzie, how you been ? - Just fine and you ? - Never better. - Hi, Rad. Dolph. Got a big order for you, Ozzie. - That's what I like to hear. - First off, I want dynamite. One hundred and fifty pounds. Do you want black powder or cartridges ? I'm not sure, wait a minute. Reeve, come on in here a minute, will you ? Do we want black powder or cartridges ? - Cartridges, eight inches. - Cartridges, eight inches. Seems like black powder would be more natural. We don't have no 40% left, is 50 okay ? - Is it? - Yes. Yeah, 50's okay, Ozzie. What is this, "Amos 'n Andy" ? Reeve knows more about this sort of thing than I do. It is you that's buying it though, isn't it? - You wanna see the permit? - Yeah. No offense, Rad, just making sure. Kenny ? Kenny, come out here. Take that boy around back and fill his order. Rad, have you forgotten how we do things around here ? Hardly. You remember that little hunt club we all started a while back ? Well, it's coming along real fine. Got almost 200 members now. And we kept you on the active list. I ain't got much time for that sort of thing anymore. - Well, you'd better make time. - It ain't the time that's stopping him. He just don't have any clean sheets. Come on, kids, we'll wait outside. - Hey, Rad. - What's up ? They're trying to unload stuff on us that's two years old. Worse yet, it's been water-soaked, you can see the stains. - Ozzie, what is this ? - That's all we got. Take it or leave it. We'll leave it. Come on, Reeve, let's go over to Bay City. Hold your horses. Can't you take a little joke ? Kenny, show him the new stuff. What's come over you, Rad ? - How much is it gonna be ? - Well, let's see. Caps, a roll of wire, blasting box, and the dynamite. Comes to $97.50. - Use this. - Taking it with you ? Yeah. Except for the charges and the blasting box. - We'll come back for these. - No, we'll take it all in one trip. - You can't do that. - Don't you give me orders. I wonder if Lou is as friendly with that coon as Rad is ? Rad, we can't take dynamite and fuses in the same trip. - We're not coming back here. - It's crazy, I tell you. You think that was any picnic for me in there ? You go on, I'll take the fuses. Let's go. That's just gorgeous. Absolutely breathtaking. - Tell Mama good-bye, Colie. - What's he all dressed up for? Hi, Sukie, hi, Eula. I'm taking him out to Riverside with me. Today ? I thought you were gonna be so busy. It's about time he saw his old man in action. - So long, everybody. - So long. - Bye. - What a sweet little boy he is. - He's got such bright little eyes. - I'll be right back. Henry ? Henry, don't you think it might be better to wait for some other day ? You still don't trust me with him, do you ? - It's not that. - Yes, it is. I thought you'd gotten over that. All right. Have a good time. I sure wish I was going with you. Why don't you drive out to Riverside after Sukie's rehearsal ? All right. It's a date. It's ridiculous how she pretends there isn't a thing wrong with that boy. Why the whole town knows he's never even said... Well, don't stop on my account. Julie, honey, I hope you don't think that we would talk behind your back. - Unkindly, I mean. - God forbid. It was just that Mama noticed a resemblance between me and your Great Aunt Isabelle over here. Yes, and I was telling them how Vernon, that's the Judge, he says we're related to the Colfaxes. - Way, way back, mind you. - So were Adam and Eve. Sukie, you feel free to borrow as many of my ancestors as you need. They go along with the wedding veil. No extra charge. Miss Byrd, something seems to be climbing up in back there. Where the hell is everyone ? There now, there now. It's all right, Colie, it's all right. Daddy's here. Daddy's... Be quiet, will you ? Look here, look here. Sit. There you go. There you are. Ain't that great ? Look. Wait. Wait, Colie, look. Look what Daddy's got for you. Look here what Daddy's got. Look here. Look, look, Colie. Look, put your hand on there. There you go. Look. Ain't that something ? Two hands. Go on, go on. Stop it, you two. Stop it. Have you gone crazy or something ? - Good morning, Cousin Henry. - I'll have the law on you for this. Got a permit, Henry. All we doing is blasting out some irrigation ditches like y'all did. - All set, Rad ? - All set. No offense, Cousin Henry, but we're about to blast. Go right ahead. Okay, Reeve, let her rip. I'll get you for this! Okay, everybody, back on the job, you hear? Well, we done it. What the hell kind of sheriff are you anyway, letting a nigger run loose with dynamite ? Of course I'm sure. He set that charge off without any warning. With my little boy right in the line of fire. Sure he saw him, you think he's blind ? Now you listen, Chalmer, they got Colie in the emergency room this very minute. So if you know what's good for you, you'll round up a posse, go out there and arrest that nigger right now. - How is he, Doctor? - He's got a nasty crack on the head. All we can do for now is put him under sedation. Tomorrow we'll start tests. Now take it easy, they got dynamite. - Now fan out there, boys. - You going in there alone, Chalmer ? I'll yell if I need help. Okay, Reeve, come on out of there, and don't try no funny business. Go on, go on. Nice of you to drop by, Sheriff. Well, this ain't no social call. I come to get Reeve. He's in there somewhere. Help yourself, Sheriff, it's right out of the pan. Here, Sheriff. Chicken can be mighty dry eating. Thanks... Hey, Reeve. Hello, honey, how are you ? - Not now, Clara. Reeve ! - Wonderful, isn't it, Sheriff ? The way Rad and Reeve are fixing their places over, just like Riverside did. Here, Sheriff, let me put a stick in that for you. - I got to take you in, Reeve. - What for ? Perhaps you could be good enough to state the charge. Now you know good and well what he did. Now, I'm warning you, Reeve, either you come along nice and peaceful-like, or I'm gonna have to call in the rest of my boys to help me. - What's wrong, Sheriff ? - Good evening, Reverend. I didn't expect to see you here. I got to arrest Reeve. Henry Warren's proffering charges against him on account of the dynamiting he done today. Do you have a warrant? I can't wait for a warrant every time a law gets broke. Especially not in an emergency. Sheriff, those men out there, they say they waiting on you. Well, you go on back and tell them to hold their water. I'm conducting an investigation in here. I'm sorry about all this, Professor. You know I like you people, I like being with you. I like all the joshing and jiving and jostling that goes on. And I like your little gals, too. You know what we say, "The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice." Hell, ain't I always treated you folks better than a daddy would ? I wouldn't know about that, Sheriff. It's been a long time since I've had need for a daddy. - Chalmer! - Chalmer ? Chalmer, you all right in there ? Now, hush up, y'all, I'm talking business. - What's there to talk about? - Shut up ! When I need you, I'll call. Okay, Reeve, come on, let's go. We wouldn't want to see you get into any trouble over a false arrest, Sheriff. Maybe you ought to get a warrant first ? Now I can get me a warrant just like that. Reeve has been blasting on land that's under a court order. - You've got to taste my cake, honey. - I'm full to bursting, Clara. There wasn't any blasting done on Reeve's land, Sheriff. - Only on Rad McDowell's. - That ain't what Henry Warren said. Why don't we let the court settle it tomorrow ? I'll guarantee Reeve's appearance there, and if it turns out that he's done anything illegal, you can arrest him then. Well, I guess your word's good enough for me, Reverend. Here, take this along with you for the ride back, honey. - Eat this in good health. - Why, thank you. - Good night, y'all. - Good night. Where's the nigger? What's going on, Chalmer, they stampede you ? Did he take it on the run ? Now mind your own business, all of you ! There's been a little misunderstanding, we nearly made us a big mistake. - You mean we ain't taking him in ? - Just let me run my own office, Dolph. Anytime I want him, I know just where he is. Right in the palm of my hand. - Sheriff. - Rad. - Hi, Chalmer. - Henry. Good luck, Henry. Stand up, please. The honorable 20th judicial court holding in and for the County of Colfax, State of Georgia, the Honorable Judge Vernon Purcell presiding. Peace, honor, and quiet are hereby commanded. God save our state and this honorable court. Be seated. I will now pick up the matter of the estate of Rose Scott, recently deceased, of this county. What is it, Henry ? Your Honor, I would like to present Mr. Lars Finchley from Atlanta. Mr. Finchley, you represent Riverside in this matter? No, Your Honor, I'm attorney for Mrs. Julie Ann Colfax Warren, interested party in the disposition of the estate. Fine, fine. What is it? Judge, could we wait a few minutes, please ? My lawyer must've been held up a little. - You went and got yourself a lawyer? - Yes, sir. I must say, I'm surprised. You folks don't generally come to court with lawyers. That's why we generally lose. It's a shame you had to go and squander your money that way. You don't need a lawyer. Now, this court is your lawyer. - Fair and impartial. - Yes, sir. Now, then, I can't delay the business of this court. But if, as we go along, you have any questions, if you don't understand some of our two-dollar words, if you're not exactly sure what your rights are, you just speak up and ask me. That's all, you may sit down. - Sorry I'm late, Your Honor. - Now who's that ? Carter Sillens, Bay City. I'm here to represent the Rose Scott estate. Approach the bench. Are you aware, sir, how extraordinary it is for a white man to come into my court and represent a black boy ? No more than it was for my daddy to present me with a negro half-brother. Don't you rattle your skeleton in my court there, sir. Your being here at all constitutes a treachery to the entire white community that's too colossal to be believed. Well, it makes my half-brother very proud. You know, I would like to state at the outset, that I object to the irregularities of these proceedings. They were called illegally, and they are being conducted illegally. We have our own way of doing things in this county, Mr. Sillens. And we don't hesitate to cut through red tape for the benefit of our citizens. And we don't need any advice from Bay City on how to run our judicial system. This is a simple, informal parlay. If it's so simple and informal, why the high-priced legal talent ? Because this here estate is disputed, and Rose Scott died intestate. Rose Scott did not die intestate, and I am here to file her will. Your Honor, if it pleases the court, I suggest the whole question of a will is immaterial. How's that ? Because there's a prior claim to the property. My client, Mrs. Warren, informed the deceased and her son of that claim. And an eviction notice was issued to Reeve Scott only a few days ago. Yes, I know all that. Get to the point. Well, it's simply that if my client's claim is upheld, then Rose Scott had no right to leave the land in question to anyone. But I have here a photostatic copy of a deed of sale that was issued in this county to Jonas B. Scott. October 16th, 1866. Who's making all that racket? - Vivian Thurlow. - And those pickaninnies with you ? My history class. I wanted them to get a look at democracy in action. See they keep quiet, you hear? - Where were we ? - The Scott deed. Yes. Now this can't be accepted in evidence as a true copy, this is just a reproduction. It's kind of blurred, too. As you wish. Here's the original. Well, this looks genuine. Of course we'll have to send it along to Atlanta to be authenticated. Judge ? Your Honor? I think I can be of help. Speak up then. Well, the other day, when you were kind enough to let me do research in the old records, I happened to run across the registration of this deed. - What? - Yes, Miss Hemmings was good enough to show me where to look. Naturally, being a friend of the Scott's, it just caught my eye. As I recall, I gave you a duster and asked you to tidy up a bit. I didn't give you leave to go snooping into county records. No, the Judge did that. Miss Ada, did you see this purported registration ? - No, Judge. - Page 136, volume 10. - We only have your word for that. - Why don't we examine the book itself? That's an excellent idea, sir. Miss Ada, can we entrust this little mission to you ? I'll have it up here in no time. - Judge, what is all this rigmarole ? - Let me do things my way, Henry. We didn't figure on Reeve's having a lawyer. Now, I want to make sure that he won't have any grounds for an appeal. Or would you prefer having my decision reversed in a higher court ? - I understand. - Right. Here it is, Judge. Volume 10. Now then, what page did you say this was ? - 136. - 136. 1154.135... Wait a minute! Wait a minute ! There isn't even such a page as 136 here, let alone a registration of your deed. - There must be, Judge. - See for yourself here. There's 135, and it goes to 138. Look here, Mr. Sillens, there's something funny going on. There's nothing unusual about that. These old records have been through a lot. You can't expect them to be perfect. Well, you've got to admit, that's a very convenient accident, Your Honor. Explain yourself, sir. Your Honor, I would like to put Vivian Thurlow on the stand to testify under oath that she saw that deed on the files just a few days ago. You know better than that, Mr. Sillens. Anything she said would be unsubstantiated and therefore inadmissible. I would still like it on the record. Your Honor, I'm afraid I would have to object. Sustained. Now then, lam not disallowing this so-called deed of yours. But until we can get a verification from Atlanta, it seems only fair we should let Mrs. Warren present her case. Your Honor, I call Mrs. Henry Warren to the stand. Yes, please. Raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God ? I do. Please be seated. Now then, Mrs. Warren, did you personally speak to Rose Scott and tell her about your claim to this land ? Yes. I needed it back to complete the Riverside package. Not that I wanted the money. I told Rose she could keep that for herself. What'd she say ? What could she say ? She knew it was my land. In other words, she admitted the land belonged to you. Yes. You tell the court why Rose Scott didn't quit this place. Well, she was very sick. This was near the end. And I knew she wanted to die in the house she'd lived in all her life. So I let her stay on. That was the least I could do. And folks say we don't take care of our own. Thank you, Mrs. Warren. That's all. One moment, Mrs. Warren. I have a few questions I'd like to ask. How long did Rose Scott live on this particular piece of land ? Always. She was born there. And her father ? He was born there, too ? - So far as I know. - Her grandfather ? He was one of our slaves. Naturally, he was born on our land. - Is it over already ? - It will be if I don't hurry. Where's the deed ? The deed to this place, where is it? - Right where it's always been. - They're really giving it to Reeve. Twisting every little thing to Henry's advantage. They even got somebody to go into the records and tear out the registration of his deed. You didn't expect no different, did you ? What do you want with this ? It's the only thing that can help Reeve. Our deed confirms his. Have you gone plumb out of your head ? You can't take this into court. Got to. They get rid of him, how do we know we ain't next? - Because we're white. - This ain't about black and white. You think everybody feels like that ? Look, who cares what they feel ? Give me the damn thing, will you ? - I'm not gonna let you do it. No. - Give it to me. No, Rad ! Rad ! No further questions. Now, I'd like to clear up one point, Mrs. Warren. - These taxes the Scotts paid... - Telephone call, Mr. Warren. Why did they pay taxes on your land ? Well my family felt they ought to pay something, you know, in lieu of rent. Taxes was what they agreed on, and I went along with that. Thank you. You may stand down. Hello, Cousin Henry ? It's me, Charles. Now listen, my daddy's fixing to do something terrible, and Mama can't stop him. Okay, Charles, I'll attend to it. You just go back home as if nothing had happened. In other words, Your Honor, the land in question was only loaned to Reeve Scott's forbearers by the Colfax family during the war to keep it out of Yankee hands. Now, this loan, under a verbal contract, has continued in effect up to the present day. The Scott family has been permitted to work it... Rad will be outside in two minutes. I want you to go out there and stop him. You must stop him before he gets inside the building. Let's get cracking. Doctor, it didn't hurt him any, did it? When are we gonna get the results on all those tests ? Yes, all right. Thank you, Doctor. Vivian, you know you're not allowed in here. - I have to talk to you, Mrs. Warren. - What about ? Won't you please give up your claim to that land ? Why should I ? That little bit of land can't mean that much to you, but it's all Reeve has, that farm is his whole life. Don't ask me to shed any tears for Reeve Scott. - He nearly killed my boy. - What? Yes, he set off dynamite while Colie was in the line of fire. That's not true. Your little boy wasn't anywhere near that place. Lying for Reeve isn't going to help him, Vivian. lam not lying. I was there. Please, Vivian, get out of here. If your husband told you that, then he's lying. I don't know why I did that. It doesn't matter. Please forgive me. I understand, believe me, Mrs. Warren. I know exactly how you feel. You see, I've been where you're going. What are you talking about? What you said in court this morning, and the way you acted just now. It's all a part of the same thing, he's turning you into something just as bad as he is. - That's enough. - All right. - But let me thank you first. - What? You saved me from a big mistake. I was hooked on a guy in New York, a guy exactly like your husband. - A white man ? - No. You whites don't have a monopoly on that kind of man. But in every other way, they're like twins. Ambitious and ruthless. Corrupting everyone... I won't let you talk about Henry like that. Don't take my word for what happened to your little boy. There were a hundred other people out there, and you ask any one of them. Excuse me. I'm in the wrong place. No, I'm not! You are! - Now what are you doing here ? - Cleaning up. I swear to God I wish I'd let you sell that place to Henry. I wish you'd given it away. I can just see all of us out in the cold. I can see Dolph and his hunt club burning the roof over our heads. You know what happens to white men who take up for colored. Think of the kids. What's it gonna be like for them, growing up with all the other kids at school hating them because of you ? Don't any of us matter? Don't you care what happens to us ? Rad, please ! You ain't going in there, Rad. Get out of my way, Dolph. Stop him! Stop him! Stop him! Son of a... Sheriff! Do something ! Sheriff, please ! I move that the claim of Mrs. Julie Ann Colfax Warren to this property be set aside. Motion denied. I move that the claim of Reeve Scott for the property bequeathed him by his mother be upheld by this court. Denied. I move the true copy of the deed of sale dated October 16th, 1866, be recognized. - Motion denied. - On what grounds, Your Honor? On what grounds ? Because the scallywag who made out this document disgraced the flag and obviously worked for the Yankees. And he barely knew the first thing about writing. You can't even make out the name. I mean, you call that a signature ? Looks like a whole lot of chicken tracks to me. Now, despite the innuendos of Mr. Sillens, we're still gonna send this deed along to Atlanta and see if they can verify it. But that may take a couple of months. And during that time, the court shall appoint an administrator for the land in question. Mr. Henry Warren, would you be willing to accept that job ? - Yes, Judge. - Just a minute, Judge. - Who's that ? - Rad McDowell, Judge. Have you something to add to Mrs. Warren's case, Rad ? - Yes, sir. - Why don't you step on up here then ? My own deed here proves that the Scott deed is genuine. - What? - See ? It says my place is bounded by the river on one side, and by that certain tract belonging to J.B. Scott on the other. - You sure this deed is correct? - Positive. And see, on mine, you can make out that scallywag's signature. Purcell, Vernon C. Purcell. Same as your own name, Judge. Your granddaddy maybe ? Seems like I'm not the only one with a family skeleton, Your Honor. Quiet. Quiet, or I'll throw every last one of you in jail. This document doesn't change a thing. It's entirely outside the relevant issues of this case. - Judge ? - Yes, Miss Julie ? I'm withdrawing my claim to that land. - It's Reeve's place, free and clear. - Julie ! Mr. Finchley, would you please have the necessary papers drawn up for me to sign ? Quiet ! Quiet ! Quiet in here! Order in the courtroom! Julie! Julie! I want you to go home, and pack my overnight bag, and bring it back here. What in the hell do you think you were up to in court ? - Now you listen here... - Keep your voice down. Sorry. Just bring me what I need for tonight. I'll be around for the rest tomorrow. - Wait a minute, Kissie. What is this ? - Go on. I asked you a question. - I'm moving in here with Colie. - Why ? He ain't any worse, is he ? It's no use, Henry. I know what really happened yesterday. I can explain all that. No more lies, Henry. Just leave me alone. Now you wait a minute... You'll wake him up. I ain't leaving here till we've had this thing out. - Now listen... - No. You listen. The doctor just told me there's still a chance that Colie can be cured. Soon as he's fit to travel, I'm gonna take him to the Menninger Clinic in Topeka. And if they can't help him, I'm gonna keep going until he's well. Or until there aren't any more specialists to see. We ain't got the money for that. Now that you've handed that place to Reeve on a silver platter, the whole deal with Riverside will fall through. Including my job. I'm gonna put the house on the market. And I'll sell my land to the first bidder. Where we gonna live ? "We" aren't gonna live anywhere. - But we're married. - For the moment. It can't end like this. Please. This is too important a thing to decide in the heat of an argument. I love you, Julie. I need you. I can't make it without you. Please. Don't throw away six years of our lives for one moment of anger. I'm not angry, Henry. If I were, there might be some hope for us. I love you. And I know you love me. Just give us a few minutes alone. - We'll have those fires blazing again. - It won't work, Henry. It won't work ? You're feeling something right now. That same old itch we always give each other. Don't. It makes my skin crawl. You snotty bitch. Where do you get off being so goddamned high and mighty ? I want you moved out by the end of the week. So they can start showing the house. And where am I supposed to go ? Back to the shrimp boats. Or anywhere you like. Open this door. You got the keys to my car. Cousin Henry ? What you doing here this time of night ? I'm running away. Just go on home. Act like nothing happened. They don't know you tipped me off. Don't make me go back. Please. - Who's there ? - It's me. Miss your train to New York ? I changed my mind about going. May I come in ? I decided to stick around. Protect my investment. I stuck my neck out at least three miles to help you save this place. Why should I run off and let it all fall into some other girl's lap ? I'm moving in. Reeve, I can't think of any more clever things to say. I love you. Only you. - Hi, what's up ? - Charles is missing. Lou and I are going to look for him. Will you take care of the others ? - Sure. Come on, boys. - Have they had supper yet ? - Yes, they have. - Well, don't worry about them. Thank you. If I'd have stuck with this instead of letting myself get sidetracked, I'd have been right on top by now. Have my own band... Everything. I could still do it. Nothing to keep me here. Maybe I'll just take off. Head for California. You know, Charles... There ain't a dream been dreamed can't come true out there. I tell you, California is the coming thing. A man can make whatever he wants of himself out there. God damn it ! I'll do it. I wish I was your son. - Why ? - So's I could go with you. Couldn't you, maybe, take me anyway ? Please. I don't cost too much to feed. Never worry about money. I can always get money. You mean you'll take me ? Why not? Sheriff? Sorry to interrupt you here, but your office was closed. - Something wrong ? - It's my boy, Charles. He's missing. - What you mean "missing"? - Just that. Nobody's seen him since early this afternoon. He'll turn up. Chalmer, the boy is missing. Now I expect you to do something about it. It's your job. Don't you preach to me about law and order. - Not after what you've done. - Sheriff, please. Maybe something happened to him. Maybe somebody... Maybe you should've thought about that a little sooner. - Please, Mr. Coombs. - Okay, okay, don't get excited. Nobody gonna do anything to him. Why should they ? He's the one that told us what you was aiming to do. I'll show you, boy. Wonderful, honey. - See if the house doesn't get him. - One more ? Yeah. Hi, Henry. Just hanging around. What? Yeah. Yeah. Sure thing. Sounds like fun. I'll meet you out at Riverside. - Mr. Warren ain't home. - We're looking for our little boy. Charles. Charles. You scared us half to death. - Where's Cousin Henry ? - What have you been up to, Charles ? Running away from home. Because you told Cousin Henry I was fixing to help Reeve. Don't hit me. I ain't gonna hit you. Don't be afraid of me, Charles. Whatever you do, I'll try to understand. Try to help you. - Can't we talk this out at home ? - No! I wish you'd never come back! I wish you'd have got killed in the war, you goddamned nigger-lover! Don't, Rad, please ! Now, I don't care what you think of me, I'm still your father, and I aim to see that you do what's right. Good night and thank you. What time you want it to go off? - An hour from now it'd be all right. - No, make it 5:00. Okay, we all wanna be home in bed when things start to pop. Charles ? You up there ? Wake up, damn it. - Something wrong ? - Where's Charles ? Charles McDowell ? Guess he went back home with his mom and daddy. - What are you talking about? - His mom and daddy came for him. - Yeah ? - Dolph, it's me, Henry. We've gotta stop this thing right away. - The hell you say ? - No, listen, listen. Charles ain't here like I thought! He's out there. He went back home. Good. The more the merrier. No, it's too late to do anything now except get ourselves blown up, Henry. - Good night. - No, no... Cousin Henry ! Come on, Charles, run like hell! Come on ! - Come on, Charles. - No ! - All hell's gonna... - No ! Outside, everybody ! Quick! Come on, now ! Head for Reeve's place ! Run as fast as you can ! Don't stop for nothing ! Come on, now, move! - Charles ! Where's Charles ? - I'll find him ! You go on! Charles, all hell's gonna break loose in a minute ! Do you want to get killed ? Charles ! Charles ? He got hit running back to Rad. No. I killed him. Just as much as if I'd put a bullet in his head. - No. - If I hadn't gone into court, he'd still be alive. - They was only getting even with me. - No. - Just like you said they would. - No, you done right. I understand that now. The last thing I ever done for Charles was to hit him. He was running to you, not away. So he must've known how you really felt. Lou. I know, I know. Come on, boys. Looks like Henry's won after all. Only if we let him. We can still hold on. You can, maybe. My place is gone. Well, we got this place. We can work it together. And we'll work to get your place back in shape. That's a couple of years away. So what? We're young, we got time. I'm sorry, Rad. We've all come to help you. Come on. Don't give her this stuff. That Henry Warren, already on the job. That mess is sure gonna cost Riverside a pretty penny. I will never again sell dynamite to a man that don't know how to handle it. Or a nigger. There ought to be a law against it.
