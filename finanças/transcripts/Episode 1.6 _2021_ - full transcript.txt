Previously on "The Lost Symbol"... Put aside regrets and do what you do best. MAL'AKH: This belonged to his son. NUÑEZ: My friends are gonna give your boss everything he wants. They get Peter Solomon back, and everybody wins. He can't go back. -No! -(groaning) KNOPP: Leviathan exists to protect a secret. We must ensure the mystery remains unsolved. Freeze right now! -Hands on your head! -(gun fires) (grunts) You seemed real eager to tell Blake. MAL'AKH: Here, you will solve the great mystery. If you don't, you will die. (deep breathing) * * (echoing gunshot) * * (sharp breathing) (grunting) (sharp breathing) (sharp breathing continues) (breathing deeply) * * (breathing deeply) (bullet drops to floor) (inhales deeply) (exhales) * * BLAKE: I don't know where this falls, exactly-- between insubordination and treason-- but suffice it to say I could have you charged. Maybe that's what you want. Maybe this is some guilt-fueled, self-fulfilling prophecy that you wind up in a cell just like Zachary Solomon. I'm not gonna apologize for trying to do the right thing. We're not in the "right thing" business. We are in the geopolitical life support business, and we are pulling our own plug if we don't do everything possible to stay one step ahead. And some ancient myth is gonna do that? Last year, pharmaceutical companies spent over $90 billion searching for a new molecule so someone's grandpa could have a softer stool. So I think, relatively speaking, our search for this thing is time and energy well spent. I'm revoking your clearance. You're no longer part of this operation, because you're gonna take an early retirement. Second prize was federal time, so consider yourself lucky. Rookie move, by the way-- the security cameras. NSA captures that entire system. Your hack trigged red flags within seconds. How do you think I found out about your little operation? * * I'm sorry. * * (line ringing) ISABEL (recorded): Hello. It's Isabel. I'm away from the phone. -Please leave a message. -(beep) Mom, it's me. I need to talk to you, um... I don't have my phone, so I, um... I'll try in a bit. Any word? Is she alive? I don't know. There's no listing of a Sophie Bastin at any D.C. hospital, and there's no record of the 911 call I placed. -How is that possible? -It's not, unless someone's trying to make it disappear. And you know who's really good at making shit disappear? The CIA. Well, then she must be alive. Why make her disappear if she's dead? They'd just call it a suicide or something, right? You're getting really good at this cloak-and-dagger stuff. The one person who might know where Dad and Robert are, and she's gone. He always taught me that when you hit a dead end, you go backwards, look for the path you missed. You think we missed something? Maybe. I need to get to my lab. KATHERINE: What happened to you? Got any new leads? NUÑEZ: What about Sophie Bastin? SATO: The janitor's wife? We think your people have her holed up somewhere. If they do, you can find out where. Maybe I could if I still had clearance. I'm out. -Out? -For all intents and purposes, my CIA career is over. -Sorry. -It's okay. I can't be who they want me to be anymore. I have something for you-- Zachary's letters. (car door opens) (car door closes) Here. Did they help? SATO: They confirm Zach had contact with that other inmate, but I can't go much further with it. 'Cause you can't investigate now. Not without the international resources I'd need. KATHERINE: But you still think they're the same person? Mal'akh and this other prisoner that Zach was with? I don't know. I'm going to help you get your dad and Robert back. -How? You've been benched. -Right. So if you think about it, I kind of have nothing to lose. What'd you have in mind? Your wife called, said it's important. But if you don't leave now, you'll be late for Bristol Myers Squibb. -I'll call Emily from the car. -(cell phone vibrates) Wait. Actually, I'm gonna need you to reschedule. Now? But the meeting's in 20 minutes. SATO: So who is the widow's son, anyway? Sorry to use your Masonic Bat-Signal when I'm not part of the brotherhood, but it was urgent. Who are you? This is a CIA file on the Leviathan Group. Diplomats, defense contractors, Nobel scientists. It's a real who's who. Ever read Hanan Mansour's "Times" series on the Arab Spring? No? Won a Pulitzer. There was a podcast, too. Really good. That reporting wouldn't exist without my intel. If you know half as much as you claim, then you know how far our reach extends. Your "Times" exposé would be buried, and you with it. I'm already buried. I want to locate someone, and your reach is what I need to do it. -(scoffs) -What about protecting the wisdom? Assuming that's still your prime directive, I could help. You get me what I need, I'll get you your pyramid back and the capstone. You find a new hiding place for them, it'll be like all this never happened. If you don't deliver, there will be consequences. * * * * * * Circumpunct. Eyeball carving in the box. It's a symbol, a circumpunct. Suspect it's another clue. A circumpunct symbolizes many things, most commonly, uh, the eye of God. It's a symbol for the Egyptian sun deity, Ra. Sun is... light. It's-it's, uh... it's enlightenment, spiritual insight. The sun. In kabbalah, the circumpunct is the Keter, the divine superconsciousness. In the Hindu tradition, it's the Ajna chakra, second sight, third eye. The ancient mantra says true enlightenment is gained by looking through the third eye. "Omnia revelantur gradu 33." "Omnia revelantur gradu..." -"Omnia revelantur gradu 33." -(writing with pencil) "All will be revealed at the 33rd degree." * * Hey. Hey. You want this to go any further, I'm gonna need something from you. Robert, my time is running out. This software is used in assessing instrumental transcommunication, EVP analysis. Uh, electronic voice phenomenon. EVP, yeah, like in "Ghost Hunters." So that's real-- getting messages from dead people through toasters and shit? KATHERINE: I didn't say that. It's a subject we're trying to better understand with noetics. -Right. -(video rewinding) -Ness no... -(taps keys) Onsen. -"Onsen"? -Yeah, apparently it means "hot springs" in Japanese, which helps us not at all. Wait, but he said something before that. (video rewinding) (garbled phrases) Pruk... "Pruk"? (video rewinding) Corp. -"Corp." -Onsen Corp? Some element containing water. An element containing water. -What? -A tank. -I don't understand. -Onsen. -I didn't even think of it. -I'm confused. They make water tanks. Pods for floatation, sensory deprivation. (sighs) The skin on his hands and neck is inflamed, which could be from prolonged exposure to moisture, and his bloodshot eyes, cracked lips-- if they weren't -properly protected in the water... -Hey, hey. Hang on. S-Slow... slow down. So you're saying this guy... had your dad floating in a tank? Yeah. But why? What was he doing to him? (door opens) (door closes) PETER: Where is Robert? MAL'AKH: Your concern for him-- it's touching. He has nothing to do with this. He's been locked up for one day. Zachary was confined for months before he died. Where was your concern then? He says he requires you for the task. (keypad beeps) (door opens) MAL'AKH: Let's hope this reunion is productive. If not, I have ways to motivate you. Just ask Peter. I'll be watching. (lock clicks) Robert. (sighs) It's okay. No, it's not okay. The only reason you're here is 'cause of me. We're together. We're alive. -That's what's important. -He knows we have a bond. He knows other things, too. Peter. Oh, God. Are you in pain? A little. He had me under some kind of sedation. So... He says he killed Zachary. He says he knew him. Is it possible? What? Tell me. We think he was in that prison with him. (sighs) Peter. We're gonna get out of this. With these. You found them. With some help from Warren Bellamy. He took some convincing. And Katherine helped, as well. Kate? She's okay. Did she see the video he sent? Yes, she did. There's a lot to catch you up on, starting with this. "All will be revealed at the 33rd degree." Look through the iris into the light. It's a clue. It's how I got him to agree to put us together. You're a 33rd-degree Mason. I think it means I need you to help me solve this. Solve it? No. We have to figure out the remaining clues, -give him what he wants. -No, I can't. -Peter, if this is about your oath... -It's about more than that. The wisdom must be protected. I can never... -(groaning) -(electrical crackling) -PETER: No, no! -Oh! Oh! (screams) Stop! Stop! All right. All right. We will give him what he wants. (indistinct announcement over P.A.) This city's a damn puzzle. Can't solve it to save my life. Tell me what you're looking for. Maybe I can help. Needle in a haystack. What kind of needle? Very old. Very sharp. Gonna need half up front. (phone beeps) -(phone chimes) -Done. * * Using Dürer's magic square, I unscrambled the letters on the pyramid. "Jeova Sanctus Unus." "The One True God." And then there's this. You have cracked riddles that few people alive could. Warren said it was a map. Mal'akh thinks it will lead him to apotheosis. He thinks the myth is real. What if it is? Not relevant. "Not relevant" isn't the same as "not real." Something has changed in you. Katherine and I, we found this old film-- a hundred years old, maybe-- it had a murmuration of birds and a man standing beneath them. The Teldar starlings? (sighs) It is part of the lore, but to have actually laid eyes upon on it... You know, Peter, I-I actually have some other theories on this -I'd love to get your eyes on. -Oh? It's... complicated. There's a school of thought in hermeneutic philosophy which says that any text or message, like this one, has multiple interpretations. So, to fully grasp it, you have to see all the layers, not just one. Are you familiar with that theory? I-I can't say that I am. I'm still thinking that even the clues we've already used, there might still be some hidden meaning left in them. Do you have any idea what that hidden meaning might be? No. It's okay. We are gonna solve this, you and I. Together. NUÑEZ: So people buy these tanks? Why? Essentially, it stimulates theta waves. A theta state can increase creativity, memory recall, insight. Augmented with certain drugs, those states can be enhanced. Drugs like ketamine? Possibly. Yes, Nuñez. Yep. I need someone to dig up some stuff on a company called Onsen. Yeah. If you could do it within the next hour? Yeah. At this number, yep. Okay. * * (door opens, closes) KATHERINE: He always dotted his "I" like that-- a slash. I remember telling him once that, um, graphologists say a slash to the right indicates irritation. That irritated him. (soft chuckle) How'd it go with that Leviathan guy? Are they gonna help us find Sophie Bastin? They agreed to my terms. We'll see what comes of it. PETER: "All will be revealed." "All will be revealed." There must be something you know that I don't know. Knowledge that-that only a 33rd-degree Mason would possess. Think. I am trying to think, but I cannot focus. My mind is full of... There's too much noise. Katherine. I was having trouble with my recall, and she "elicited my frequency-following response." And despite your skepticism, it worked. The ring. Custom-forged for the conferring of the 33rd degree. With a pi cipher, yeah. PETER: Not only that. It had a very special construction. * * That's it. Now, I had always thought the symbol was for use with wax seals. Now I'm not so sure. (sighs) "All will be revealed at the 33rd degree." 33 degrees is the measure of an angle. -So turn to the 33rd degree. -(clicking) (click) * * This will take us to the final stage. A dagger touched by the heavens. All that is required is blood from the instrument. -(beep) -(door buzzes, lock clicks) (sighs) I'm here to visit the patient. ID, please. What, no gift shop? I forgot flowers. Funny. Has anyone spoken to her yet? No. She was in pretty bad shape. Hasn't said a word since she regained consciousness. (monitor beeping steadily) Ms. Bastin. I'm Larry Carter. I work in Operations. You're in a secure CIA medical facility. (groans softly) Now, I know you don't want to talk, so I brought this-- amobarbital. Indicated for anxiety, epilepsy, insomnia. You're a pharmacist. You know that. (Sophie groans softly) What you may not know is that it has a potent off-label use. (Sophie groaning) The right amount of this in your IV, and you'll tell me everything. (exhales slowly) CARTER: Sophie? Now... Where's Mal'akh? (grunts softly) I don't know. I don't believe you. Are you lying to me? No. (Sophie's breath trembling) (shakily): He's careful. Only m-my husband-- he knows. What about other names? Aliases he uses? -Christopher. -Christopher. -Christopher what? -(exhales) (rapid beeping) Sophie? Stay with me. Abaddon. It doesn't matter... what you know. The CIA can't stop him. You don't have to worry. The CIA will never know what you just told me. That or anything else. (computer beeping) (monitor beeping rapidly) (monitor flatlines) SATO: Every tank Onsen ships to the eastern U.S. comes in through the Port of Savannah. From there, they're farmed out to various trucking outfits. We'll start within the DMV. You get D.C. You get Maryland. I'll take Virginia. Wait, I have a shipping address here in Georgetown to a company called Somafree Inc. Right. We're gonna see a lot of that. We'll have to run down who owns any of these companies or shell corporations. Why are you here? You've already lost your career over this. I told you, I want to help. But why? -Langdon is being held... -Wasn't your fault. That was your boss. And I get it-- he's CIA. He's not supposed to give a shit about my family. And neither are you, and yet here you are. Why? Did you know my brother? You said something before about how he was someone trying to do the right thing in his own way. You knew him. In Turkey. I was stationed there. He got in some trouble. The drugs. SATO: No. Before that. He was running with some young, rich, politically connected people. In some cases, very connected. One of them died in a car crash. There were drugs involved. Zach's drugs. I used it to recruit him. Recruit him? I-I... I don't understand. She flipped him. Made him an asset. Right? So you're telling me... what, that he was a spy? No, he would just keep tabs on some of those people he was hanging out with and report back. He was good at getting invited into things. He could be very winning. And he was smart. Really smart. He was a Solomon. But he was also an addict. And I put him in an environment where there was a reasonable expectation that he'd be tempted. And he was. And this was your job? Blackmailing people. Praying on them. Sometimes. I'm sorry. You're sorry? If everything that is happening now goes back to that prison... ...then all of this is because of you. Zachary, my dad, Robert. He was just a kid. (phone vibrates) That's my Leviathan contact. Hello. How's it spelled? As agreed, when I find them, they're yours. Christopher Abaddon. Got him. * * (high-pitched tone reverberating) (tone fades) The Rose Cross, symbol of the Rosicrucians, Ancient and Mystical Order, the Rosae Crucis. "The secret hides within The Order." -The Order of the Rose Cross? -Perhaps. -What's "the secret?" -Rosicrucian doctrine says The Order came from "truths of the ancient past," which offer great insight into a "spiritual realm." Descartes, Pascal, Spinoza. -Luminaries of the Renaissance. -All Rosicrucians. As was Albrecht Dürer. -Scientists, artists. -Alchemists. The Rosicrucian founder was a German mystic and alchemist, uh, Christian Rosenkreuz. Later revealed to be Francis Bacon. Possibly Bacon. His actual identity-- still in question. But yes, ei-either way, "Rosenkreuz" was a pseudonym. Another thing these Rosicrucians had in common: big egos. Who else would call themselves "One True God"? Jeova Sanctus Unus-- is that a name? A pseudonym hiding in a Latin anagram. "Isaacus Neutonuus." Latin interchanges the letters "J" for "I"... "V" for "U." Isaac Newton, who was also Rosicrucian and an alchemist, as were the others. -Now what? -Now what? You've summarized this perfectly. I don't follow. LANGDON: Been asking the same question over and over again ever since this whole thing started. It's just-it's just one cryptic clue after another, after another, after another, after another. -Robert. -It always comes back to the same question: just, "Now what?" I've been chased. I've been gassed. I almost died twice trying to get that pyramid. He took my hand. He put me in a coma. Maybe you should've just told him what he wanted to know instead of honoring your ridiculous oath! Right, because far be it from you to believe in anything greater than yourself. People have been killed! Well, why don't we just take all these and destroy them? LANGDON: Because then we wouldn't be able to get out of here! -(clattering) -(Langdon and Peter grunting) * * * * This is as far as you go. You need Peter for your ritual. Right? He's "the instrument." If he dies, your whole plan unravels. MAL'AKH: You won't hurt Peter Solomon. No? He's been like a father to you, more than he ever was to his own son. You've always been sharp, Robert, but you're in my world now. Raw intellect can only get you so far. Raw intellect can only get you so far. MAL'AKH: Hopefully he's not a disappointment like your son. Oh, God. It can't be. SATO: Let's try this again. Stay where you are. (yells) SATO: Stop! Wait, no. No, it's Zachary. He's Zachary. Let's just stay put, okay? Let these guys do their thing. OFFICER: Copy that. They've got them at the rear of the property. Uh, I got her. KATHERINE: Dad. Katherine. Thank you. Oh, thank you. (indistinct radio chatter) PETER: You watched the video. -You watched it. -(Katherine crying) My little sundial. * * (panting) OFFICER: Stop! Don't shoot! OFFICER: Get down on the ground. -Get down on the ground. -SATO: Get down, now. Do what they say. Zachary. There is only Mal'akh. SATO: No! * * (indistinct chatter) PETER: It is him, Kate. It is. -I don't know how, but it is true. -Dad, you've been through a trauma, and your perception is clouded. PETER: And oftentimes, to win us to our harm, the instruments of darkness tell us truths. We should get him to the hospital. All right, watch your feet. You're gonna step up now. Watch your head. -Careful, careful. -(grunts) -NUÑEZ: All right. -Oh. I won't let him out of my sight. I promise. I love you. (siren chirps) It's not true. Robert. No. No. -Katherine. -No. * * * * (sniffles) * * (sniffles) How? I don't know. (crying) * * (birds chirping) * * I need your clothes.
