I am Professor James, allow me to tell you a little bit about myself. I was born and raised right here in Houston, Texas. I left here and went to Howard University where I received a double major in English and in business. And then I left Howard and came back here to Texas right here to this school, Texas Central where I got my master's and my doctorate. I put a lot into my education so I expect nothing less from none of you. I only have two rules in my room, make that three. [book thuds] First there is no sleeping in my classroom. Secondly respect each other. Third don't ask for extra credit this is not high school. The young man to my immediate right is now passing out the syllabus for this semester. So next Wednesday I expect each and every last one of you to have your books, no excuses. You will see this young man periodically in my classroom because he's my graduate student. - Hey. - [Stacey] Benjamin Williams. - [Stacey] Stacey Atwater. - Yeah. You was at the step show last night, right? - [Stacey] Are you following me. [laughing] - No, I just never forget a pretty face. - Before you look inside of your syllabus I'd like to inform you that this is gonna be the only short day of the semester so enjoy it. Class dismissed. - So where you heading next? - Biology. Biology, do you mind if I walk you to class? - [Stacy] Sure, why not. - Let me grab this bag for you. - Thank you. So do you give all the freshmen girls this special treatment? - What? [laughing] See that's messed up. What a guy just can't be nice and have no motives? - No. [laughing] I'm just kidding. [laughing] - Uh-huh. Okay. So I'm pretty sure you had a lot of schools to choose from why Texas Central? - Family tradition. I had two cousins who went here in the 90s, I really just couldn't see myself going anywhere else. What about you? - Well, I mean this school it has, it's great for TV and film so that's why I'm here how to learn how to write and direct films. - Oh, so I might be walking with the next Tyler Perry. - Hey, hey now you might be. So you might wanna be nice. - I will do my best. [laughing] - Well, thank you for letting me keep you company. - Well thank you, it was very kind of you. And I appreciate it. - Here's my card, give me a call sometime. - What? - Ooh fancy. - Oh, okay. [laughing] Robert Rodriguez said, "Every filmmaker should "have a business card." - [Stacey] Who? - The director from "Desperado". "Dust till Dawn". Look don't worry about it, we'll talk about filmmaking another time if you have time to fit me in your schedule. - I might can squeeze you in for a few minutes tomorrow. - Okay, that's what I like to hear. - Bye. - Bye. [gentle music] - Hey Jas. - What it do? Ain't that how y'all say it down here in Texas? [laughing] - So funny. Now all you need is Paul Wall grill and [mumbles] cap and you'll fit right in. - How was your first day of classes, your professors cool? - Well yeah, first day was pretty decent. My professors were nice, they were cool for the most part. - Yeah, they all seem nice till they drop a pop quiz on us. - You know what? That's why mam, we gotta stay ready. Already bought all my books from the bookstore. - Yep, let's go ahead get to it. - I did meet a guy. - Only one. Girl, I got about four hounding me already. - Girl, that's because you fast. But I mean anyway he was different. - Stacey, don't fall for the game. They all seem so different and deep at first. - No, he's a older guy. He's a grad student. I met him at my English class. - [Jasmine] Older guy. - [Stacey] Yeah. - That might work. Is he cute? - You saw him at the step show. - Who? That guy you was staring at all night. - Stop it. I was not staring I was just. - Staring. - No I was just... - Staring. - Looking. But he gave me his card and told me to call 'em. - What he gave you his card? - Yeah, what's wrong with that? - He must of been watching that Milton Brothers movie "Do's and Don'ts of Dating". I know the game. - Girl open these books. [light music] ♪ Staring at the head of these blank page ♪ I have to admit this is the first time I have ever been taken to a bookstore for a date. - Oh, we never stop learning, right. - Well, I guess. So what do you have me reading? - Well, I noticed you like to wear African [mumbles] garment so I grabbed you a couple African history books. - How observant, thank you. And what are you reading? - Oh, books on filmmaking. So if you're nice to me I might put you in one of my films. - Whatever. I'll make sure to keep you in line. - Mm-hmm, okay. So three weeks huh. - What about three weeks? - Well for the past three weeks every night you kept me on the phone before you agreed to go out with me. - Well, I couldn't make all of my availability easy, right. - I mean you have good conversation that's why I was interesting or I'd been gone a long time ago. - Oh, really. We'll I guess I'll take that as a compliment. - You should. - My mom always did say, "I could talk a lot "when I wanted to." - Ha, yeah I believe her. - Hey. [laughing] - So did you date a lot when you was in high school? - So that's where this conversation is going. - Inquiring minds wanna know. - I dated a couple of guys in high school. - Anyone serious? - Not really. There was one guy that I was serious with. I was serious with him junior year but we broke up right before prom night. - Wait, what happened? - Basically in a nutshell I wasn't ready to do the things that teens do on prom night. - Wow. So he left you because of that. - Yep. - Well, that's his loss because I'd never do that to you. - We shall see. - Well, enough of the 21 questions. Let's get outta here. - All right. [group chattering] - I noticed. Hey Stacey. Wake up. Stacey, wake up. Hey wake up. - Oh, hey Jas, what's up girl? - Just getting in from soccer practice. I know you not slacking already in these classes. - [Stacey] Oh, girl I'm up. Okay, I was just resting my eyes. - Yeah, sure. - Hey this is my teammate Tiffany. - Hey, nice to meet you. - Hi, nice to meet you as well, Tiffany. - Stacey, you look wore out, you need that rest. - Girl, I'm fine. I was just on the phone all night with Benjamin. You know how that goes. - And I also know your daddy's gonna lay the smack down on you for that cell phone bill. - Ah, Stacey y'all must be in the honeymoon phase, huh? - Yeah, that's what they call it. [laughing] - Well, you know if you need help staying up I know a guy with some pills. I mean it's better than No-Doz. - Thank you but I think I'm gonna take a raincheck on that one. - All right. - Hello. - Yeah. - Oh, I've been thinking about you all day too. - She's already hooked. [laughing] But anyways did you talk about coach? - Hey. - Hi. - Come on in. - Thank you. - Wow, you look great. - Thanks. Jasmine helped me pick this out. - I see she have an eye for fashion. - Yes, she does. - Oh, I hope you don't mind taking off your shoes. I'm trying to keep this place clean here. - Yeah, it's okay, I don't mind. Where should I put them. - [Benjamin] Right there by the door is fine. - [Stacey] Okay. - Right this way. - Thank you. So have you made any films? - Yeah, yeah, I made a couple short films here on campus. You know creating art is fun. - Well thank you for doing that because we need more people that look like us creating content for us. - Indeed, thank you. - [Stacey] You're welcome. - Power to the people. - Right back at ya. [laughing] - So are you close to your family? - Yeah, we are real close. We pretty much do everything together. Come and think of it this is the longest time that we have ever been away from each other. - Really. - Yeah. So what about you, are you close with your family? - Nah, not so much. You know my dad he ran out on us when I was about two-years-old. - [Stacey] What? - Yeah, so I reached out to him about a couple years ago but he kept his distance. Let my mom tell he's a no good player. - What, damn. I'm sorry to hear that you had to go through that Ben. Well, how are things between you and mom? - My mom, my mom still tryin' to get over my dad. You know she raised me to the best of her ability but I look so much like my dad she take all her frustration out on me. So you know when I finally see something that's worth having I try my best to keep and sometimes to a default. - Well, you don't have to worry about any of that with me. - If you don't like the grades you receive then that means you need to step it up. You can make the grades up during midterms. Class dismissed. Except for you Stacey. I said class dismissed. How do you make a C- in my class when I know you can do better? - I'm sorry Professor James... - Sorry is a game made by Parker Brothers, it's a game board do you like being played? - No sir. - Then why this, huh? What's going on with you? - I just gotta get my focus, I been so tired lately. - I'm sure that your parents don't wanna hear any excuses, they didn't send you here to make any either. You tired, what's the difference between the Stacey now and the Stacey that was here at the start of the semester? - I can handle it Professor James. I just didn't think. I... - You didn't think. You didn't think. You didn't even think! Do you know what it took for you to get into this classroom? Stacey, do you know what your people had to go through, what our people had to go through? Do you know what our ancestors had to deal with just to get us here? Do you know the bodies that were severed? The backs that were beaten? Do you know the ones that didn't make it just so you could get here in my classroom? Stacey, let me give you a little bit of history when God made man and called him Adam but he put Adam asleep and make him a helpmate because Adam didn't even know he needed help! You understand me? Eve was her name but I'm gonna treat you like Adam should've treated Eve when she got tricked by the Devil because somebody's tricking you. Do I make myself clear? - [Stacey] Yes sir, Professor James. - Get out of my presence. - [Stacey] Yes sir. - And Stacey. - [Stacey] Yes sir. - Have a good evening. - Hey what was that all about between you and Professor James? - Oh, my grades are slipping so he just wanted to give me a pep talk. - [Benjamin] That's all. - What do you mean? - He wasn't brushin' up on you, was he? I mean you'd tell me. - No, of course not. He was just concerned about my grades that's it. - Okay. - But I'm gonna have to double down on my studies for midterms so I won't be able to see you as much. But I promise to call. - I understand. Let's just make it count next time, deal. - Deal. [upbeat music] - Hey you tryin' to warn me about something. You got me watching this crazy movie. [laughing] - No, I just like thriller films. - What's this called anyways? - "The Perfect Wife". - "The Perfect Wife" what a cliche. - Shh, this is the good part. [phone ringing] - Let it ring. You always jumping as soon as your phone rings, there somebody more important than me? - No, there's not. But you know it might be Jasmine. - So. - So me, Jasmine, and Tiffany are supposed to be hanging out today. I mean you know they're my girls, I'll always be with them. - And what about me? - What about you? I spend all of my time with you. I barely even get to see them. Lately it's just been you and these classes. - Okay, well what's wrong with that? - What do you mean? Boy, don't make me hurt you. Over there being greedy. - Look you don't need to hang out with your friends. - Wait, what? Are you joking right now? - Look at me, I'm all the friends you need. - Okay, so what about you, don't you have friends? - I'm like that rapper Z-Ro, I only hang one. - Oh my goodness what am I gonna do with you? - You almost there. - Dang Stacey you look good. Girl, where you going? - Well thank you girl. Benjamin is taking me out tonight but he didn't say where he just said, "That it's a surprise." - Now Jasmine is gonna expect the same thing. Thanks a lot Stacey. - Oh, no, no, no, do not put me in the middle of y'all two situation. But step it up bro. - Don't look at me you seeing a grad student, I'm just a freshman. Holla me in five years. - So is Benjamin coming over? - Yeah. - Oh, great. So we finally get to meet him. - Yeah, you've been hiding him all semester. - He's just a loner, okay. He just likes to be by himself. [door knocking] Hello. - Hey. You look great. - [Stacey] Thank you. - Oh, I didn't know you was gonna have a packed house tonight. - Stop being so nervous these are just my friends. And this is my roommate Jasmine and her friend Anthony. - Yo, what's up bro? - Hey, how you doing? - And this is my friend Tiffany and her friend Eric? - What's poppin'? - Hey Benjamin, I mean it's nice to meet you. We've heard a lot about you. - Well I hope it was good. - For the most part. - You ready to go babe. - Yeah. I thought you was gonna wear your hair down? You know I like it like that. - Oh, yeah I know but I just wanted to go ahead and put it up so it won't be in face. - You know don't worry about it. What was I thinking? Maybe I was asking to much. - No, no, no, it's okay. Look I'll go change it real quick. I'll be right back. [light music] - [Jasmine] So how are things going with you and Benjamin? - It's good, I can't complain. - You don't think things are moving a little too fast? - No, I think we're at a good pace. - Does he have a temper? I've seen him snap on you a little bit a few weeks back. - I mean I can tell that he likes things his way but it's nothing I can't handle. - Well, you know I'm here for you. I got your back, right. - Yeah girl, thanks. - Oh by the way Tiffany's having a party next weekend, can you come? - Yes girl, you know I'm there. Oh, and can Benjamin come? - Yes, Benjamin can come. - Thank you. [laughing] Oh and one more thing? - [Jasmine] What's that? - I'm taking Ben to meet my parents next weekend. - What? Wow, it's getting serious. Do you think your family will like him? - Yeah, I think so. I mean it's not like I bring boys home all the time to meet them. - I guess. Like I said, I'm here for you, you just let me know how it goes. - Thank you girl, you know I will. So you ready for this next 200. Come on. [laughing] - [Jasmine] All right. - Ah, look who finally came home to visit her family. - Mom, most you be so dramatic. - You knew that was coming. Who is this you got with you? - Mom, this is my boyfriend Benjamin. - Hi, nice to meet you. - [Gladys] Boyfriend. - Yes. - You and I got a lot to talk about missy. - [Stacey] Okay mom. - This is for you Mrs. Gladys. - Oh. - Did you hear someone say boyfriend? - Yes Dad, this is my boyfriend Benjamin. - Nice to meet ya Benjamin. - It's a pleasure sir. - Well, we gonna take this party on into the dining room where my beautiful wife Gladys has prepared a delicious lunch. After you. - So Dad, what do you think? - Fetch me a slice of pie. Is that how he talks to you? What the hell was that? - Yes Dad, that's just they way he talks he doesn't mean anything by it. - Stacey, I have to be honest I don't like it, okay. I think you should focus more on school. This relationship thing just seems too serious right now. I'm afraid it's gonna distract you and your grades are gonna drop. You got the rest of your life, okay. - Okay Dad, I got it. - [Winston] Stacey, I'm serious. - I know. - [Winston] Stay focused. - All right. - Fetch you a slap.

Look I didn't know she was gonna be there. - Why didn't you just tell me that when I asked you the first time? - I don't know I was just acting stupid and selfish. - Well, from where I was standing it looked like something's going on between the two of you. - I know how it most of looked to you but there's nothing going on between her and I. You have to believe me. - Why should I? - Look I want you to meet my mother. I mean she's the only person that means a lot to me in my family. I mean I must warn you she can get a bit harsh at times. - Your mother. I don't, I don't know what to say. - Say yes, please. - Yes. - You wanna go to the student center. - Yeah, let me just get my purse. Okay. [dramatic music] You have a lovely home. - Do I? - Yes, you do. - Thanks for noticing. - [Stacey] Your welcome. - Benjamin where'd you find her? She's cute. - I told you momma, we go to school together. - Boy don't get smart with me! Now you watch your tone in my house. - Benjamin is the professor's aid in my class, English literature advanced. - Advanced. So you one of those smart girls. What you doing with my son? [laughing] I'm just kidding. Yeah, you always did like I'm young and smart though just like his daddy. - Momma. - What? - That's enough. - Benjamin is also smart and kind. He took me out for our first date to the bookstore. Now how many girls can say that? - Not many. It sounds like a cheap date. - Well no, we also go to parties and step shows together. As a matter of fact we're going to another step show this Friday. - Well, hopefully he'll keep up the good work with you. I'm sure you'll keep him in line. - Will do Ms. Williams. What kinda spices did you put in this gumbo, this taste so good? - That's just a old family recipe. Boy get that food off your face! You don't feel that right there! And put the cloth around your shirt like I showed you. - Yes, Momma. - Godliness is next to cleanliness. - Cleanliness next to Godliness Momma. - I told you don't get smart with me. Like I was saying, hopefully he'll keep up the good work with you. Looking for somebody to pass this recipe down to. Seriously though how's my son treating you? - I mean we have our ups and downs just like everyone else. - Are you sure he's not kicking you down. - You know what that's it. - What? - We gotta go. - Benjamin, what is going on? - You have a good night Momma. - [Stacey] Benjamin. - Well I guess y'all don't want the peach cobbler than. [upbeat music] - So how was dinner last night with Benjamin and his mom? - Let's just say I see where he gets some of best personality from. - She was crazier than Benjamin. Glad I wasn't there. - Girl she was just so negative. I mean not towards me, mostly towards Benjamin her only son. - Look, hurt people hurt people. - What do you mean? - I never told you this but I was a victim of domestic violence in high school. - What? Jasmine I don't understand you're so strong. I can't imagine somebody putting their hands on you. - Honestly I didn't see it either till it happened. - I mean if you don't mind telling me what happened? - I had a boyfriend in high school, we were so in love. In my eyes he could no wrong. My friends would tell me he had a drinking problem 'cause his dad not being there for him and he could be violent at times. - Jeez I mean did you even believe them? - I mean maybe but I didn't see any of that when he was with me. Till this one day we were at a party I was talking to one of my homeboys, we were laughing and joking. My boyfriend was drinking of course and he took the situation the wrong way and he beat up my friend really bad. - What did you do? - What could I do? I yelled, I screamed, I begged for him to stop but he didn't. Then he took me in the backroom called me a whore. I told him, "I wanted to go home." But I guess out of frustration he slapped me. Of course he said, "He was sorry, he'd never do it again." - Jasmine did you take him back? - I loved him. What could I do? I couldn't see myself with anyone else but him until it happened again. After that I told my dad and my brothers and they went to pay him a visit. After that he literally wouldn't look my way at school. - Wow Jasmine. - Look I'm not telling you to get some goons if these happens to you but at least seek help of some sort. - Thank you for sharing that with me. - Of course. - Babe. You got a text message from Tiffany. - Oh, okay thank you. Get my phone. - I got it. What's your code? - Why do you wanna know my code can I just please have my phone? - What we hiding things from each other now? - I'm not hiding anything from you. - Okay, so why you got a code on your phone? I don't have one on mine. You know why? Because I trust you. I'm not hiding anything. - Tweety108. - Your kid sister. - Yes. - Man don't Tiffany got anything better than do, she got some studying or something? Man she all hyped about this step show tonight. - You'd be surprised she studies hard. She made the Dean's List. She just party's harder. - If you say so. Who is Simon Taylor? - My math tutor, why? - Because he called you yesterday at noon. - Yeah, he was trying to see which part of the library to meet up at. - Who's Kevin Smith? He called you a couple times on Monday. - He is just my friend. - Friend. - Yes, we are just friends. - He is just a friend that I don't know about. - Look he's in psych class and he helps me with my work and sometimes he just makes jokes. - Jokes, what kinda jokes? - I don't know just jokes. - Oh, so he's a funny guy. And you like funny guys? - Look I don't know where you're going with this but I'm not cheating, that's not me. [dramatic music] - Listen to me, you don't need no male friends. Man, man I tell you made me forget what I need to write. - I'm sorry. - Make yourself useful, go fix me somethin' to eat. I got a lot of errands to run. - Okay. - And hurry up. - Hey babe. - Hey. - Why weren't you at the step show everyone was there. - I had a paper that was due. Where you been? - Just around the campus with the girls. - Did you forget? Cleanliness is next to godliness. Why you always hanging with them hood rats? - Jasmine is the furthest from a hood rat. - And Tiffany? - She's just likes to have fun. - Get up. Turn around for me. What are you wearing? You look like you like to have fun too. Am I right? - No, I'm not like that. - You know I love you right? You know that right? Okay. Good. - I love you too. You can finish getting ready, I'm gonna go ahead and fix your noodles. - Yeah, you do that. [upbeat music] [vocalizing] [vocalizing] [vocalizing] - Hey. - Hey. - Is he putting his hands on you? - He's not hitting me if that's what you're asking. - No yet but it's coming. - [Stacey] You don't know that. - Stacey, I told you about my situation, physical abuse is most likely the next step. - He has a good side to him you just haven't seen it yet. - And you haven't seen it in while. Look, I'm here to help you but you have to help yourself. I can change him. I can let him know that the relationship isn't working out how I want it to. - He's a man. - He's understanding... - He's gonna be who he is. - Well I have faith in him. [vocalizing] [vocalizing] [door knocking] [vocalizing] - What you doing in my house? - No, you don't get to ask the questions now. I'm gonna talk and you're gonna listen. - Really. - What are you doing putting your hands on her? She's scared of you now. This whole relationship ends today. - Whoa, whoa, it ends when I say it ends. And besides whatever she told you I didn't do it. The only thing I did was talk to her and that was it. - We both know that's a lie. - Prove it. - I will. - What a minute, what are you gonna do, huh? Because I don't see her going to no cops on me. You know why? Because she loves me. - I don't think she loves coward Benjamin 'cause that's what you are, a weak sorry spineless coward that picks on young girls. - Wow, what a big mouth you have. Someone should teach you how to shut it. - And who gonna teach me, you? Is that how you plan on teaching my friend Stacey? Look, I don't care about you. I'll put them laws in your life. - Tell 'em what you wanna tell 'em you have no proof. It's your word against ours. I'm her man, I know what's best for her and don't you ever forget it. - If you knew what's best for you, you would stay out of her life. - What'd you say to me? - You heard me. - Are you threatening me? - I'm just telling like it is boo. Karma don't play no games. - Let me explain something to you, when I lay hands on Stacey she understands. Yeah, she understands that I have to teach her. Yeah, yeah, she understands I have to teach her wrong from right. Teach her how to respect and treat her man. You see I can tell your man haven't been treating you right. See you got your head held way to high baby girl. You should bump it down a taste. - Man, you a man, I don't think so. You're a little boy pretending to be a man. You probably never even grew up with a man inside the house. You're a little boy who likes to throw temper tantrums on young girls. Isn't that right Benjamin? Let me ask you something where's your mother? Yeah, that would explain a lot. Yeah, you got the right one 'cause if you put your hands on me you better kill me. - Get out of my house. Get out of my house. - Or what? [laughing] - Benjamin. - Hey, how you doing Stacey? - Good. - Can I speak with you for a moment? - Kevin this is boyfriend Benjamin. - Oh, Benjamin man, look pleasure to meet you man, heard a lot about you. - How you doing brother? - [Kevin] I'm doing all right, yourself. - All right. - All right. - Let me talk to Benjamin, I'll catch up with you later Kevin. - Okay, I'll see you in class. - Okay. - And Benjamin, nice to meet you man. - Must you continue to embarrass me. Now who the hell was that? - That's Kevin. - Who? - Kevin the funny guy I told you about that's in one of my classes. - Well, it looked like you just broadcasting your relationship to the public with this dude. - I told you he is just my friend. - Friend. - Yes, yes. [groaning] - Get up. You okay? - What? - Look now I told you I'm your only friend. Now let's go. - I don't know what I wanna listen to. - [Jasmine] What the heck happened to your arm? - Look it's nothing, it's my fault. - You better tell me what happened before I go to the cops. - Ben asked me very nicely to stop talking to other guys on campus and I didn't listen. - So what? That's called manipulative and being controlling. - I know. - Come on Stacey. - I know. I'm gonna go talk to the professor, I promise. - You better 'cause if you don't I will. And I mean that. I can't believe him. - Well good morning, this is a pleasant surprise. - Good morning, Professor James. I was wondering if I could talk to you about something. Sure but if this is about your last grade I'm sorry I can't change that. You had quite a few grammatical errors. - No sir, it's not about that. It's about Benjamin and I. I've been dating your graduate assistant Benjamin Williams. - Yeah, I'm aware. - Well, we've been having a few problems in our relationship and I just wanted your advice on it. - What kind of problems Stacey? - Well, Benjamin and I have fun for the most part we have a great time together but when things just don't go right and everything's not going well it just gets so bad so fast. And I guess what I'm trying to say is that I think he has anger issues but something he just can't control it. - Stop. Is he putting his hands on you? - Yes. - Are you afraid of him? - Professor James I don't wanna get him in trouble. - Listen, if he's putting his hands on you and causing you bodily harm you know things can progress worse than that, right? And you shouldn't be with him. - No. - Stacey, I'm gonna give you a number to a very good friend of my across the hall in the next building. You call her, okay. And she can give you the next step that you need to take. I really appreciate you bringing this information to me. - Thank you so much Professor James. - Thank you. You gonna be okay I promise you that. - Okay. - Call her now. - I will. - Okay. - [Benjamin] You wanted to see me sir. - Oh, yeah. First you are no longer my graduate assistant, do you understand? I don't wanna see you in my class. I don't wanna see you on this campus. And I definitely don't wanna see you around any of my students anymore, you understand me? - What, what, what, where's this coming from? - Mr. Benjamin, you put your hands on any young girls lately? - Look, look Professor whatever she told you look I can explain. - Whoa, ain't no need. I'm sure if pick up my phone right now and call any of your ex-girlfriends they all have very similar stories. Do you catch where I'm coming from? Look Benjamin, listen to me carefully dog go get you some help but get out of my class. - You don't want me to get the laws involved. Do I make myself clear? Do I make myself clear? - Got it. - Good. And leave my credentials at my door. - I'm about to hang up. For real I am. Why didn't you hang up? Why didn't you hang up? No babe, you. - Girl if you don't get off that phone. - Okay babe I gotta go for real. Yes. I love you too. I love you, I love you, I love you. [lips smacking] Excuse me somebody's a hater. - Please, do you wanna see my phone? I keep a rotation. - Whatever. What's up Stac? How are you and Benji? - Girl not good right now. [door knocking] - Speak of the devil. It's Benjamin at the door. Should I answer it? All right. - [Benjamin] What's up Tiff? - [Tiffany] Hey. - Jas. Hello Stacey. - Hello. - Can we talk alone? - Whatever you have to say to me you can say in front... - Man, you haven't answered my calls or texts. - So what does that tell you? - And I have somethin' important to talk to you about. Can we talk in private please? - Look you have five minutes. - I'm so sick of him. - He's so fucking rude. [groans] - What the hell you doing going to Professor James? Don't you know I lost my [mumbles] 'cause of you. Huh? Shut up. Now you listen to me. Listen to me. Snitches get stitches, you understand me? Huh? Don't nobody love you like I do. Look at you. You're fat, you're ugly, and you ain't that smart. Come here. This is your fault, not mine. [crying] - Oh my God. Everything's gonna be okay. Wait, just try not to move. Call the police. - [Tiffany] Okay. - [mumbles]. - [mumbles]. - That's him right there. Excuse me. Runner. Are you Benjamin Williams? - Yes. - This is Officer Smith, I'm Officer Johnson, we're from the Texas Central Campus Police. Show me some ID. - May I ask why? - You don't know. Didn't do your best impression of Ike Turner on your girlfriend just yesterday? - Man I don't know what you're talking about. [laughing] - Yeah. - Let me see your hand. - Look is this really necessary? - From the looks of your girlfriend it's necessary. Now show me your right hand. I won't ask again. What happened to your right hand? - I don't remember. - He don't remember Smith. - So you don't remember boxing your girlfriend? - Man, look whatever she told you. - What? - I ain't do nothing. - Yeah get him down, get him down. Put your hands behind your back. You're being arrested for assault and battery. - Really. - Yep. - What, come on man really? - [Officer Johnson] Oh, yeah really. - That's all right I'll be out in the morning. - Yeah right, well tell it to the judge. - Pretty boy think you gonna be out in the morning. - Right. - That's funny. [laughing] - Got me up that this jail early this morning. What if I had warrants? I tell yam you don't think about no one but yourself just like your daddy. - Mom, I didn't do it. - Yes you did! Now you just cut out all this foolishness and control your temper. You gonna touch the wrong girl somethin' gonna happen to you. Go on get in this car. - Would you like some coffee or water? - I'm okay. - So tell me, how you feeling dear? - I'm just trying to get through it. - Have you gone through domestic violence before? - No. And I never thought that I would have to because I'm smarter than that. - You are, you are a smart strong woman. - It doesn't feel like it. - Stacey, a lot of women don't tell anyone for months or even years. This is why I'm really happy that you did go to the professor. Have you told anyone else? - No one else knows besides my two friends at school Jasmine and Tiffany. - Why haven't you told your parents? - I can't tell them. My parents won't understand and they would never let me out of their sight. - You have absolutely nothing to be embarrassed about. - But I do feel embarrassed. - I mean after all that is what family is for. I'm sure that they love you and care about you very much. And I would encourage you to talk to them. - But what about my little sister, she's only 16-years-old and she look up to me, what is she gonna think? - She'll probably think I'm really proud of my big sister for one. And she may feel anger or sadness but mostly she would probably be relieved. - Relieved. - Yes, relieved. You see I don't know if you realize this or not but you are teaching her a very valuable lesson. Your courage is showing her what to look for in men like that in any relationship. - I never thought of it like that. - Stacey, do you think it was your fault that he put his hands on you? - Sometimes yes. Sometimes I believe that if I would just wear what he wants me to wear everything would be okay. If I just bend to his will that everything will be okay. - Stacey, as a survivor of domestic violence I'm here to tell you right now that everyone and I mean every single person is responsible for their own behavior. They're accountable for their own actions and reactions. Especially men like Benjamin. I know his kind very well. But I want you to walk away today, I want you to know, I need you to know that this is not your fault. It is not your fault, okay. - Okay. - Say it, it is not my fault. - This is not my fault. - Say it again Stacey. - This is not my fault. - [Counselor] Again, Stacey. - This is not my fault. - And it's not baby girl, it is not your fault, okay. Listen I have card I wanna give you there's some information on here about a group for victims of domestic violence I think it would help with your healing. - Thank you. - Your welcome. It'll be better, I promise. [dramatic music] [group chattering] - Sweetheart, what's wrong. I can tell something's bothering you, is it school? What's going on? - It's about Benjamin. - Benjamin and you are not getting along. Couples do argue from time to time baby. - It's grown to much more than that Mom. He used to be so nice and considerate then he started to get upset and possessive and he even wanted to know who, where, when or why I need to hang out with my own friends. - Wait, has he started putting his hands on you? - I'm going to kill him. - Nah, baby girl you not gonna do anything because I'm going to kill him. - Wait, we don't need any family members in jail. We're gonna let the police deal with this misguided soul. - Why didn't you come to us? - I thought I could handle it. I thought I could change him. - You don't have to handle these things by yourself. That's what family is for. - I'm so sorry I let you down little sis. - I'm learning just like you. You never let me down. You're so brave. You're my hero. - We're gonna get through this together as a family. And I want you to know that you wasn't dealing with a man that's a boy, a damn coward. I don't care how old you are anyone who prays on the defenseless is a coward. - I'm just glad that you found out about him now rather than years later after a baby and after he stole your youth. - [Stacey] Right Mom. - We're here for you baby. Your family is here for you. It's gonna be okay. - Good evening ladies, thank you for coming out. We have a new member with us today, her name is Stacey. - [Group] Hi, Stacey. - Hi. - Thank you for coming out Stacey. Who wants to share first? Demetria. - How could someone that I love beat me? He was my husband. I cooked, cleaned, ironed his clothes, and I even stayed with him after he had a baby outside of our marriage. He had my mind and my heart and he purposely [mumbles]. [crying] - Thank you for sharing Demetria. - Hi. - Hi. - I hope being here today helped you. - It did but I kinda feel bad 'cause I didn't get a chance to tell my story. - Everyone doesn't tell their story on the first day. And Mrs. Rose doesn't push you to. I was here about a week before I told my story. I guess it's similar to yours. - Why would you say something like that. - I dated Benjamin last semester. And I've seen you two hanging around campus and I can only imagine what he's done to you. - Did you go to the police? - No, I was embarrassed to tell anybody. My family and friends they all loved him. He was so charming. But I had this one close cousin she knew the truth and she saw right through him. - How did you get him to stop? - The last time I saw him he beat me so bad. - Answer me when I'm talking to you! - I just stopped answer the phone, text messages but it took him about a month to get the point. - In time do you think we will ever be able to heal from this situation? - I think so as long as we learn from this relationship we'll be all right. - You're right. - Hey, here's my card whenever you wanna talk just hit me up. - Thank you. - So I'll be seeing you again next Thursday. - Yeah. - And don't think I ain't see you talk to that dude in the cafeteria. - Who David? I told you he's dating one of my line sisters. Babe you really gotta chill. - Watch your tongue when you're talking to me. And slow down that walk. You walking too fast. Stay on my hip. And stop poppin' that gum. It's disrespectful. Give it here. [crying] Now you quit all that crying and go in there and clean yourself up. And you better be here when I get back. [crying] [dramatic music] [blooping] [blooping] [blooping] - I'm about to go to my car to get my biology book. - Hurry up. - What you want it for? Look you get caught with this you don't know me. Hey, this is what you load it. [gun bangs] [gun bangs]
