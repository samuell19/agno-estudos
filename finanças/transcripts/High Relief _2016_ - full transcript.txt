[Breathing] My whole life, I always thought Cannabis was an illegal drug. It was something people did illegally. It was not something That you were supposed to do. It was against the law. It was frowned upon by society. There were no benefits to it. It was really just going to destroy your life. It was going to make you lazy. It was going to make you eat too much. It was going to make you stupid and not be able to remember anything. It stimulating. Mind expanding. Safer to use than alcohol. It's the in thing. The hula hoop of the jet generation. And a much a part of growing up As smoking corn silk behind the back fence. But I want to tell you about something, that has everyone buzzing. Something that concerns mature boys and girls just like you. Something called grass. [Music] Theres a lot of abuses, a lot of loopholes. There's a lot of vaugness in there. AS a result, it's not something that we should put in our constitution. [Music] So I researched it and low and behold. It was a medicine in this country. From 1850 to 1937 Manufactured by Merck, Elli and lilly. All the major pharmaceutical companies. And it was used for different disorders. prevalently for muscle relaxing, anti-inflammatory and pain. And I went Whala, that's what it's doing for me. I gotta try this! [Music] We have known there are anticonvulsant properties in this plant for 40 years. The federal government is standing in the way of scientific progress that could save our children. It's unbelievable. The fact that we still don't know how to use it effectively, is unpardonable. This issue, whether it be amendment 2 or senate bill 1030 is about parents having options. Not everyone is going to sign that waiver and allow their kids to be put on veterinary medications. Truth is, there's a million things that are more fun than sitting around getting stoned. Yeah! We like to party! [Music] Losing all motivation, It's likely that you will drop out of school. Take a sudden liking to sitar music and maybe even get felt up by a cop or two So why smoke grass? I took it on a dare. I am Mike Tyson a professional fighter You can keep drugs out of your life and knock them out of society, by saying no Say no to drugs! You there. Stop laughing! Laughing is a sympton caused by blowing pot. Take a good look at yourself. Are you addicted? Are your eyes half shut and bloodshot? Do you recognize that person in the mirror? Then blame it all on marijuana [Screaming] Florida is known as a swing state. It's known as a gateway state, once Florida goes The rest of the south will go. Georgia will become medically legal, Tennessee will become medically legal, and all the states around. We've collected a million signatures to get this on the ballot. We're fighting to make sure we get 60% of the votes we need to pass this constitutional amendment. To allow for medical marijuana in this state. Well just in a few month you and Florida voters will get the chance. to vote on amendment 2, which would legalize medical marijuana. Well tonight the group "No on 2" is saying that is it passes, something as simple as a cookie. When mixed with pot could "Be the new face of date rape." Amendment 2 caregivers can't be arrested or sued If their pot hurts someone. They don't call it the drug dealer protection act But they should. Yes on 2 allows medical marijuana use Under the strict supervision of a doctor. Only for debilitating conditions and diseases, Such as cancer and M.S. As a sherriff I'm worried about amendment 2 But as a father I'm angry amendment 2 is a scam It preys on compassionate Floridians And gives teens legal access to pot Make no mistake Teen drug use will rise. They don't call amendment 2 the pot for teens amendment, but they should. There's polling that says it will, that says it won't. Look, 60% is a landslide in Florida Those who cover politics, it's a landslide. If it doesn't get there then my effort failed, but look I'll tell you this. I would much rather, Greg, Try and fail, then to never try at all. What is on the ballot? The ballot summary, [Speaking text on screen] That again is what voters will see when they vote. And it says "other conditions." I think the other conditions, what other conditions? Debilitaing diseases or other conditions. What's another condition? I don't sleep well at night. My legs hurt. The problem that exists is that Because there's an existing CBD law in Florida There is a possibility that the voters will become apathetic Meaning they will think "Oh, the laws already there. Why do we need to change it?" and not vote. So what is the difference between the statute that was passed that takes effect in January. "The charlotte's web act." what is the difference. between what they passed in January and what might come on amendment 2? charlotte's web will only help a small number of Floridians with a certain segment of debilitating conditions. They have estimated 100K patients under charlotte's web. The department of health is estimating 400K under amendment 2. and I don't believe that charlotte's web will help the vast majority of Floridians. It's very clear to know that charlotte's web is Marijuana in the form of a pill or an oil. And there have already been legislators looking at expanding the scope of that bill. cause it's very tightly regulated. It's the big scam of 2014 To get the compassionate people of Florida, which we all are. To vote and legalize marijuana It's about money, It's about greed. I think this is a good chance for Florida to step up. Stop being the last leg to kick in. And as far as current polls, Florida is 90% in. On one hand yes, Florida is taking the right step towards legalization. On the other hand they didn't produce any of the rules. and the way they took that step, was not the best in my opinion. It's called "Senate Bill .1030" Under 1030, the way the rules are setup. There are only 41 nurseries in the state of Florida that would qualify, for a license. And of those 41, they are only going to give out 5. and they are estimating there are about 40-50K patients that could benefit. From this low THC marijuana You've got 5 dispensaries catering to 40K potential patients It's not enough. Most states that have medical marijuana laws have done it, the route of their state legislative bodies. Which means that in those states that have had issues, have had loopholes, seen abuse in the law. The legistlature in that respective state, has been able to go back and amend the law. Unfortunately, This is an amendment to our state constitution. This is not a bill. There's no way to amend this, this is what it is. I'm standing behind amendment 2 because, I've seen people that I know and love. Members of my family, close friends. Lose their lives, or lose big chunks of time in their lives, as a result of addiction. And most of that addiction has started with the legal prescriptions of narcotics like percocet, clonapine, xanax. As a result of depression anxiety, car accidents, so to the extent that people can be recommended to use marijuana versus these dangerous, highly addictive, potentially lethal narcotics. I think that's a good thing. Good for the state of Florida, and good for the public health. I'm not arguing, that People that are severely sick, and no traditional medicine works Shouldn't have a pill that has the cannabanoids of marijuana in that I support that, but that's not what we are debating here today. We are debating an intoxicant that is going to be abused, because there have been intentional loopholes written into the law. Aparently in California, and some other states. 27 States and the district of Columbia have approved medical marijuana. But in California, some doctors are apparently Skyping with patients and you have a brief conversation with the doctor and then he writes you a script. Now is that possible in Florida, under this? I don't believe that it is. California is not a representative example. California was the first state to pass a medical marijuana law is 1996, it is largely the example of how not to do this. There have been 22 other states plus D.C. that have passed medical marijuana laws since then. In drafting our law, we were able to take examples from each state. and take the best parts from each, and leave out the worst from others. Largely what we have tried is not be like California, and I think we have acomplished that with Amendment 2. The languange in this bill is nearly identical to that, citizens in California currently have. [Ben Pollara shouting that is false] and we've seen what happened with the pill mills. In the past where We had fake doctors all over town, handing out How is that comparable? I don't understand. We had all these clinics and stores, people were walking in and getting recommendations for prescription medications for very vague conditions. This is exactly what's going to happen if voters approve this amendment. We are going to have marijauana stores all over town. I think the polls have changed so much since I started working on this. Even just a few years ago. I think the older generation has been able to see this it hasn't just been what they perceived. They've been able to look things up on the internet, see the videos, see the children with epilepsy in Colorado. and everyone else that's been having to move from one place to another. I think we have gotten to where we are because of that, I think we have a good chance. The problem is in non presidential year elections You don't see the same voter turnout, and that's our job to get voters to the polls. It's certainly a challenge to get to 60% in Florida or in any state. We're one of the only states where you need 60% to pass, most states are 50% plus 1 This should be put into law, where we can change it. as things change, as we understand, what the impact is going to be on dosage On Strength We can change a law, we just can't change a constitutional amendment very easiliy. It's really not a controversial proposition to most people that If a doctor recommends some sort of treatment to a sick patient, whether it's Whether it's exercise, a change of diet, a multi-vitamin or the use of marijuana. That patient should be able to follow their doctors recommendation, without fearing arrest. I don't think that's a controversial position. I don't think it will be going into election day, which is why I think we'll win. We started this documentary... In a lot of ways, we didn't know where it was going to go. Me personally, I never thought that weed could be used medically. I thought my whole life, that it was fake, not true. These were lies people were giving That weed could actually be used as a medicine. I always thought it was people trying to get around the system, around the laws. To make it so that they could smoke weed legally. I thought it was all a big trick. [Music] Studio A64 is here, we call it liberty hall. It looks like a ship, we call it the buffalo ship. Because our founding fathers threw tea into the harbor. Then went out to a bar and got drunk, look it up. Look it up, our founding fathers. All those guys we worship. They pirated a ship, threw in the tea in the harbor, went to a bar and celebrated their rights as Americans to do so. So studio A64 is just that. We're not George Washington, not Thomas Jefferson. We're just two veterans who believe in our country and we are going to fight for that damn right. [Music] It's kinda like in the very beginning, with the end of prohibition. You tried to regulate and criminalize this, and all it did was ruin your society. And Colorado, Washington Alaska, all across this country 23 states and the district of Columbia have legalized it for medical or recreational use. So the question is, where do American's go where they can express their rights and liberties that we're founded on. We have coffee shops, we have bars, we have cocktails. Cannabis is the same thing, we must be equals as artists and individuals. Because we are Americans. [Music] So why is our federal government not allowing it to be legal? Money, that's the only reason anything happens in this country is because of money. If they can make more money off of marijuana than prescription pills, Marijuana will be legal. And that's the main reason marijuana is becoming legal right now, they figured out they can make Money. We have a blue-print on what to do, and what not to do. And I think this is going to push the federal government in a direction as more states adopt policies as it relates to marijuana use and revenue streams The federal government has to ease up on the reins and allow for fair and free trade to exist, because right now it's a cash only business. Yes, I'm the Wolf of Weed street. How's that? I guess I would consider myself a marijuana stock analyst. Basically I have created a community of investors to capatilize on the green rush or the .bong era So to speak A small group of investors who wanted to take part of this company public. The issue was, I didn't know anything about stocks he didn't know anything about stocks. We didn't know how to plan it out. However he came up with a very interesting way to seperate the public entity from the growing. The problem is when you grow marijuana it's federally illegal. It's a schedule 1 drug. Because it's a schedule 1 drug, how can you have a public company that is illegal federally. So he devised a plan to seperate out all the other, what they call the picks and shovels, all other products except for the growing He seperated it out, and it was ingenius. and I helped him with putting all that together and I helped with one of the first companies that went public It had a tremendous surge in price because of the way it was structured. It did very well, that was my exposure to this. I learned a lot. My father accidentally fell into this industry after taking to companies public. So I sort of piggy backed onto that as an attorney as well. I was already an attorney before we got into the industry. However what I did was, instead of being just a Florida attorney which is what I was originally Once I realized there was a market for this industry not so much in Florida back then, this was a year and a half ago there was not really anything going on in Florida back then. What I ended up doing was going out to states where marijuana was legal right now and I went and took those bars. So that I could get barred in as many states as possible with regards to marijuana. A lot of people anticipate that this should be like any other business, but There's nothing about this business or industry that is typical. Just when you think you have it figured out somebody throws you another curveball. We were very fortunate to make some good friends early on that allowed us to share a license. Which was the easier way for us to get up and going. We were able to purchase a small percentage instead of starting from scratch. One of the challenges here in Colorado to aquire a license to produce, is you have to have a facility. and your facility has to be within zone. and then you can apply for a license. So that means people end up taking a huge financial risk by acquiring an overpriced property on the hopes of getting a license. and there's no guarantee. In this industry I have noticed that you have two groups of people. You have the businessmen in the suits, and then you have the lifestylers or people in it for the good of marijuana. and to succeed in this business, you need both. The hardest part right now is trying to get the two parties to work together so that they can actually produce something that'll work. It's like, we've done this by our boostraps you know, using sales to evolve the product line and build up my studio. Stuff like that, its been a huge challenge. Shifting from being an artist to a businessman, but its been great everyday is exciting and crazy I wouldn't trade it for anything. This is the future right here. I think it's incredible. It's a really good time to be in the business. It's very beneficial to our community. That much money going into Denver Colorado. New jobs, new packaging jobs. Obviously the direct relation to the cannabis industry. It's just more tax dollars for our schools our roads, and it gives people like me who are new college graduates a chance to show our own in a brand new industry, that got pulled out of the black market. and pulled out of the hands of drug dealers. Because the truth of the matter is, no one on the business side who's ever done cannabis. There's nobody on the cannabis side who's ever really done big business because you couldn't do it. So to meet cannabis with big business, or big business might be an innapropriate term but business professionalism. It's really a unique item, and interesting how it's working to get to that point. When we all first started this, most of us when we first started was about 5 years ago. and when amendment 20 passed for the state, back in 2000 it was pretty much open. When president Obama said we are not going to prosecute people for medical marijuana is basically what he said. Everyone decided to open up shops here and see what happens. You've got people with no business experience at all trying to do this. There were no rules, no rules at all yet. We finally got rules July 2011 and they are very strict. All the felons had to be out of this. Once we got in, new regulations continue to come down the pike all the time. Packaging was a new one and you'll see the state continue to come down on edible and milligram dosing. and what not We had all our process and procedure and everything in play and then they say now we need single use, child resistant, tamper evident, batch numbered packaging, and you have to have it by the first of January. And the states making millions of dollars. Millions and Millions. Although not as much as originally anticipated. Some people seem to feel that if marijuana is legalized We're going to be able to pay off the national debt. No, it's not going to do that. It's going to make a lot of money, no doubt about that. But that's not why you want to legalize marijuana. You want to legalize marijuana because it would be beneficial to our communities. Number 1 reduction in alcohol consumption. It's amazing when you think about it. So this, I came from a medical background with cannabis. I joined the military, and swore it off during that time because that was our oath. But when I left the military and had a chance to live my life and come to Colorado. Experience the revolution. It really is a social, economical medical, recreational, industrial revolution. You can not over-estimate this. Cannabis touches every aspect of our lives. The clothing we wear, the lotions we use the medicine we prescribe to ourselves. Those who think that legalization is a panacea, I think they need to ask themselves some tough questions too. because if we start having a situation where big corporations, with a lot of resources and distribution and marketing arms are suddenly going out there and pedaling marijuana then the levels of abuse that are going to take place are going to be higher. [Music] If you learn anything tonight it should be that marijuana is not marijuana, is not marjuana. Marijuana is um... can vary widely in composition between strains, and it's very important to keep that in mind. One marijuana strain can be very rich in the cannabinoid cannabidiol and very low in the cannabinoid THC. and have very little psychoactive effect. Another strain could be very high in the cannabinoid THC and low in the cannabinoid cannabidiol and have a very strong psychoactive effect So when people say CBD The only pure CBD that exists right now That is safe and okay to use is produced by GW pharma and it's called epidiolex. and it is currently in clinical trials. Anything else out there that you see called CBD it's not CBD it's some form of whole plant material that contains everything else including CBD. Cannabis, it's something that effects everyones life. Its been illegal so long, everyong thinks its a dangerous drug. Everyone thinks it's harmful, something to get addicted to. and it can destroy your life. But the truth it, for many people it's the reason that they have life. It's the reason they can live a normal life. And it saves, it's a life saver. Marijuana as a schedule 1 drug is asinine scheduling. whoever does the scheduling, is a moron. How you can put cocaine, heroin and marijuana into the same category is beyond me. You're saying there are no medical benefits to marijuana. Yet, you don't want to test it and see if there are medical benefit to marijuana. The proof is in the pudding, so to speak. I understand the need and urgency to find better medications for our children. I have personally in California experienced going to drug dealers. to try and get medication to treat my son. These are drug dealers that know nothing about epilepsy. They know nothing about how fragile my son is. They give me something that they call CBD rich. Now, in their opinion CBD rich means something that doesn't get them very high. In my opinion, CBD rich is something that has little to no THC in it. Well my name is David, I am a little person. My type of dwarfism, is call SED congenita. Which means I have skeletal dysplasia and I was born with it. This has caused me to have sever limitations in my mobility. which got progressively worse as I got older. It wasn't your normal back twinge, where a lot of people go to Chiropractors for. is was a pain that has me curling up into a fetal ball. I was hyperventilating to the point I thought I was going to have a cardiac arrest it was so painful. I can't carry a coversation, I can hardely see straight. It's unbelievable. I've had it looked at by my orthopedic specialist at John's Hopkins who know dwarfism. I've had it looked at by orthopedic specialists down here. I've had it looked at by pain specialists. I've had it looked at by my regular GP I've had it looked at by my chiropractor. No one can figure out exactly what it is they don't see anything wrong, I've had MRI's. It's a mystery to everyone, they think it's a side effect of having all those surgeries as a child. My name is Irvine Rosenfeld and I am the longest survivor of the final two federal medical cannabis patients in the United States. So about the tenth time I did it, I played a game of chess. and I hate chess. and it took me thirty minutes to lose. Then it dawned on me, I sat for the entire 30 minutes. Now up to this point, over the last 5 years I was able to sit for ten minutes and then stand for ten minutes. Sit stand, sit stand. So in what way had I taken the narcotics that allowed me to sit. Then it dawn on me, I hadn't taken a pill for six hours. Then how was I able to sit? Just then the person next to me handed me to joint, it was my turn. and I thought, this is the only thing I have done differently, I smoked this garbage. I wonder if there is any medical benefit to this garbage. And that's how it all began. My introduction to all of this was through the viewpoint, because I don't smoke because I don't ingest it. The person who got me into this industry asked me, do you have any pains? I said yeah sometimes my leg it pains. So he took out a cream. It was not this but a similar cream. and it was a cannabis infused cream or a salve. He said, where does it hurt? I said here under my knee. He said, okay let me put some on you. He put some on one knee, I said, what about the other one? He was a little pissed off I was having him put a salve, just below my knee. So he put it on and he asked me then we started talking, he asked me after 4-5 minutes. So how's the pain? I said, what pain? It had actually just, I don't want to say magic, but it disapeared. The truth is cannabis is a it's like the fountain of youth. it stops oxidation, it stops aging processes. In the future people will be using cannabis in their diet. If you eat cannabis raw, it doesn't get you high. Most people don't know that. Since it doesn't get you high. You can eat a fairly large amount of it. The more you eat, the more antioxidant properties it has. It will protect the beta cells of the pancreas. Those are the cells that produce insulin. The opponent to medicinal cannabis, focus on the guy with the surf board. I focus more on the child with epilepsy, or the mother with M.S. or the grandmother with cancer, or the father with cancer. You know like, this is real. And if it were my daughter, my father my child or my grandparents I would want them to have access to all treatment options that might work for them. To me, it's insane that people don't have that. So I went back to Port Smith, and knowing that the federal government would probably stonewall me, it would take me about a year to write this up. I needed a supply of marijuana. So I went to the chief of police in my hometown in 1972 and told him what I was planning to do. I asked him to give me confiscated marijuana so I wouldn't have to deal with the criminal element. and I explained to him and said check with the school board and ask them about me. Check with the top doctors in the community, ask them about me. Top lawyers and business people, ask them about myself and my family. and see what comes back. So I gave them a week and they came back, and said number 1 we asked the school board and they said you're one of the best students they have ever had. They said I was an advocate against marijuana in high school, and if I say it works medically then it must. They should give it to me. They checked with the doctors in the community and they said he's lucky to be alive. and if marijuana works for him, them you should give it to him. So I said, so you're going to give it to me? and he said No. I said why? He said for several reasons, number you would be breaking federal law. I said F federal law, they don't have to know about it, I am not going to be bragging that I am getting it from you. He said the second thing is, that if you caught something from the confiscated marijuana, then the city would be liable. I said I would indemnify the city. He said, I suggested that and the city manager said no. You see this was 1972 and they were starting to use paraquat and all that stuff. So the city was worried. So the chief of police , chief boone, said to me. Irvine look You're not a criminal you are a patient. He said, promise me you'll never sell it and if anything happens to you. You have them call me. When I discovered this benign substance was the best medicine for me I went about trying to educate the federal government. I was going to school at the University of Miami. He was picking up his tin of medical marijuana joint there every month from the university of miami bausch and palmer hospital. It didn't make sense to me how this stock broker in Fort Lauderdale was able to have medical marijuana, but the rest of the Floridians in this state were not able to have medical marijuana. and there were all these other states around the country where people are able to get medical marijuana. It didn't seem right, it didn't seem just, and it didn't seem possible. I was living in portland oregon. In 1995 I became a caregiver for a close friend of mine who had contracted AIDS. He was a roley poley of a guy that had wasted away to next to nothing. I saw that his use of marijuana, cannabis restored his appetite so he'd eat, keep his weight on, stay alive. Back in 1995 people were taking a cocktail of drugs and a lot of them if not all of them, had very negative side effects. The cannabis helped mitigate the side effects The nausea and all this kind of stuff, so he would stay faily compliant with his medication. In 1995 AIDS was a terminal disease you got AIDS and you died. So it was kinda depressing. So the cannabis did what? It helped him feel better and lift his spirits. So here was this medicine that made him feel better helped him stay compliant with his medicine, helped him eat so he would stay alive and I had to go out, or friends of his had to go out on the streets to deal with criminals to get him this life saving medication That's the time that I recognized cannabis had health benefits. I've read bit and pieces about it helping people at NORML rally's and stuff when I used to go as a college kid. In the Grateful Dead shows I would hear about it helping people eat. That are dealing with chemotherapy and helping people with AIDS. That are dealing with wasting away and losing their appetite. but I've never really heard about it helping with pain until I figured out that it was really helping me. Seeing what the FDA has approved in the last 15 years as it relates to medicine for various ailments. The greater likelyhood of opiate addiction as it relates to substances like oxycodone or oxi-cotton. and those being legal market drugs. You really run out of excuses as to why marijuana. is still being put into this box. We have endocannabinoid systems in our body. We are biologically designed by the God you believe in, for this. Whether it's medical or recreational. Our bodies are by design are for it. It's quite all natural really. When you're born, everybody has endocannabinoid receptors. But a perculiar thing happens when you first use cannabis. Something happens where they don't exactly know what it is, but you up-regulate additional cannabinoid receptors. And all of a sudden you have multitudes more endocannabinoid receptors, once you use cannabis. What this does is that it allows the user to have neuroplasticity. It allows you to inhibit certain parts of your brain that you were not able to inhibit before. And so you can inhibit the amygdala and when you turn the amygdala off you turn off the fear, and the anxiety, that's why when you eat cannabis. When you eat cannabis, it gives you a feeling of well being. Like there is no danger around you. I never thought that it could help me until I needed it medically. At the age of 28 I was diagnosed with epilepsy, I had my first seizure. I had to go to the hospital, I was in the hospital for a few days. And what did they do? I was put on a prescription pill. That's what our system does. We are put on pills, that's the way the medical system works. There's no options, that's all they have. Surgery or pills. [Seizure sounds] Who am I? What am I? [Incoherent gibberish] Am I your girlfriend? Yes So I started to do my own research and learning about CBD oil and how it can help with epilepsy. I decided to not listen to the doctors. Because doctors did not care. That's the one biggest thing about the medical industry today. They don't care, they just want to make their money. I decided to take the risk and start taking CBD oil everyday Since then, it has been six months and I have not had one seizure. People use it for pain, they use it for depression, they us it for glacoma. They use it to get a good nights sleep, they use it to combat and it does more movement disorders, how could one one plant have such an incredible and broad array of effects. It's because it interacts, it's the only thing out there that interacts properly with our endocannabiniod system. And this endocannabiniod system is a very mysterious thing. We only learned about it 25 years ago. because we didn't have the technology to see it, but once we found it. But it turns out the endocannabiniod system is our largest neuro transmitting system in our body. It is part of what keeps us in balance, it is a very old system. A very old system, it dates back 650 million years. When cells were just beginning to talk to each other practically. That's how old it is. And what happened, and why it is so important to us and why cannabis is so important. Is that as our organism became more complex, our muscles became more complex, our nervous system became more complex, our digestive systems became more complex, the endocannabinoid system evolved with these changes to act as the balancing mechanism. It is the endocannabinoid system that keeps us in balance. We have an endocannabinoid system. And we need to feed deficiencies for some people. The plant has been around for 34 million years and it treats all 210 cell types. It's magnificent, it's evolved. And we've evolved, and what we need to do it start to isolate the different molecules of the plant and implement them dietary suppliments for some people and dietary essentials for some people. This state is full of sick and dying patients They've tried a variety of pharmacuetical drugs that have not been helpful or have been terrible for them with all the side effects. They need to at least have the option to try medical marijuana if their doctor thinks it could be helpful for them. The benefits I've seen are unbelievable in some circumstance, and we need to study this and research it more. and allow patients to have safe access in this state, without fearing being arrested or having their home raided. [Music] most people as you know, smoke the bud, take the bud, and medicate that way. But there's a lot other concentrates, or pills where people can put these in a purse go to work, and go to the mall. Where nobody knows what they are doing, so they can medicate. You've got shatter, which is like liquid gold. A lot of people use the shatter when the bud doesn't work for them anymore. They've become resistant to the bud and they need something a little stronger, so they use the shatter. We also have tinctures, basically an alcohol based oil, they can put in liquids and food A different way to take it, more stealth. You have edibles you can take with you wherever you need to go, the whole point of this is to medicate without people knowing what you're doing. You're not pulling out and smoking a joint. Creams for aches and pains, which help a lot of people. Basically, this is what you'll see out on the market on average. There's a lot more, but this is the majority of what you'll see. Most people think bud is the most popular product, but it's coming back to more of concentrates, people are really getting into the dabbing and the concentrates, it's a smaller container to carry around with you. It's more concentrated in itself. There just getting away from the bud. It's a something we're seeing, we never thought we would see. This is all over Colorado, and if it's happening here eventually it will happen in other places. Bud is becoming the least that we sell It's gonna be edibles and concentrates that we sell more of. [Music] Prohibition cannot be enforced for the simple reason that a majority of American people do not want it enforced, and are resisting its enforcement. That being so, the orderly thing to do under our form of government, is to abolish a law which cannot be enforced. A law the people of this country do not want enforced. Let me give you some history first. Harry Anslinger was married to the daughter of the director of the treasury. What happened was they passed the marijuana tax stamp, which made marijuana illegal. And apparently Mayor Laguardia, or governor Laguardia, decided to trick Henry Anslinger. What he did was He started a study on marijuana and asked Anslinger for permission to get marijuana for his study. And Henry Anslinger was the head of the government basically so he was the only person that could allow anyone to have marijuana. So, Anslinger agreed to provide, marijuana for this six year study. And there was like 35 scientists and doctors conducting this study, it was a six year study. At the end of this study, they disproved all of the governments negative claims about marijuana. It upset Henry Anslinger so bad, that he decided well first off he destoyed as many of those copies as he could get. And then he said if any doctor practiced, or did any experiments on cannabis without his specific written consent that he would make sure that doctor did jail time. Well I think that's a conversation changer too when you talk to people about reefer madness and why marijuana or even hemp, right, is illegal. People tend to go, really? I had no idea. I had no idea that people lobbied for and were successful in a propaganda movement that banned a plant. Why are you locking up someone for having a joint. There's no point, who is he harming? I mean the crime associated with marijuana just personally seeing it What's the worst that's going to happen from someone that's high? They are going to raid a vending machine or something? You're not really looking at violent crimes when it comes to marijuana. Now there is some violence around it because it's illegal. But once you sort of get rid of that illegality around it, any violence around marijuana should go away. Well if you understand the history of prohibition and what caused it to become illegal you'll realize that tobacco doesn't threaten the timber industry. tobacco doesn't threaten the pharmacuetical industry. tobacco doesn't threaten the prison guard union. tobacco doesn't threaten any of the lobbying efforts for cannabis to remain illegal. I mean if you look at the history of it. It had something to do with the Nixon administration and it was probably backed by big pharma coming in and saying let's crush this drug, because they realize that there probably is a legitimate medical benefit that you can recieve from marijuana. We need to have more medical studies out there showing the reality. This is what is does for people and then teach them that in school. Right now it's seen as this drug it's dangerous, it's evil you have to go out and do it only because it's forbidden by your parents. Well if they were educated on what it will do, then it's not that thing that you have to go out and do. Like drinking alcohol. Look at all the studies they haven't done, and all the studies they have done. We don't hear about, they don't tell us what the good and the bad is. Well the government has been lying to us for 70 years. I remember going to school, and seeing these black and white films One of them in particular, a group of kids go out and smoke marijuana, break a bottle and drink the broken bottle. You know This is what we were all filled with, the horrors of marijuana. You're told it day after day after day, you're going to believe it. You tell a lie often enough and it becomes the truth as far as people are concerned. They've got this saturated in their brains. And on top of that, on top of that, we had the sixties, where a lot of people my generation, started smoking marijuana. and yet, so you know the older people saw and said Oh My God, these kids are smoking marijuana and their having free sex, and their saying what they want to do, and they are against us going to war. So marijuana not only got a bad rap from the government lying about it for so long but it also got a bad rap because they associated it with a major social change in the country. The lies that the government has told about marijuana has hurt them more than they understand. If the government is willing to lie about this then can they be trusted on any other level. So what this means is that people don't trust their government because they know this is such a lie. and so it hurts them in their taxes it hurts them in respect. We used to be a land where we respected the police. Where we respected our rights. Where we had a may berry mentality. But maybe that was always a fiction. [Music] So the first question that I think we need to ask is do we have data from scientifically conducted, um studies in a very rigorous manner. Where you compare the safety and efficacy of the various components of the marijuana leaf in people with epilepsy. And when we are talking about people with epilepsy, we have to be very careful because we have different types of epilepsies. We have certain anti-epileptic drugs, for example, that work for certain types of epilepsies and don't work for other types. Have we proven safety? Because that's a very important issue. And at this moment, the answer is no. I order for use to capture this information Dr. Canter is talking about This critical information that we need, in order to go out and treat our children. With a medication that might help them instead of harm them. Either the same person, the specialist, the epileptologist, who understands the condition of epilepsy, also understand marijuana. And be comfortable prescribing it, or know how to prescribe it. Understanding how to treat with it. Only for, double blind, placebo controlled trials, where the drug was tested, and the total about of patients in the trial was 48. So you realize it's not a large amount of individuals where this drug has been tested. I am a desperate parent. There are other desperate parents in this room. We have no alternatives We can't wait three or four years for FDA studies. The big problem is, and doctor you're saying the importance of studies. I agree I would love to see studies of the whole cannabis plant. But the problem is, the reason we can't do studies is because marijuana is a schedule 1 drug and no one can study it. Over a hundred thousand people die every year from FDA approved drugs. A hundred thousand. Not one person to date has ever been documented from the use of marijuana. This is not a drug we can willy nilly use because we don't know that it hasn't killed somebody. That is not necessarily true. Guys, when people because toxic with these agents people can commit suicide. The problem is, how many doctors do we know that have the education and the knowledge about the use of medical cannabis. I personally know 4 or 5 and I know a lot of doctors in this state. The problem is that the doctors here are not educated. And basically what we saw from senate bill .1030, the doctors would go online, and take an 8 hour class online. And that's how they would learn about it. Is that enough? So you know who know's the most? The passionate parents, the parents like me. The people who care about their loved one. They'll study it, they'll learn as much as they can. We have known that there are anti-convulsant properties in this plant for 40 years. The fact that we still don't know how to use it effectively is unpardonable in my opinion. The fact that federal government is standing in the way of scientific progress, that could save our children, is unbelievable. My alternative is, going to the nuerologist, and this is a true story and they said to me, Mr. Hyman, your daughter has intractable epilepsy. A third of all epilepsy patients have intractable epilepsy. Meaning, traditional medications do not work in any shape or form. So i would think that 33% of patients, their desperate, they would try anything. So we go to the doctor, and he says look, we are at the end of the line here there's really no other options. But, here's an option, we want you to sign this waiver. This waiver states that your daughter might die from taking this FDA approved medication. Sign it, oh your daughter may go blind from taking this "FDA approved" medication. So do we do that? The answer is, I didn't. We didn't. So here you have a medicine that could potentially give relief. And we do know, I don't think that the thousand of parents in the other legal states Colorado, California, and the other 27 something states I don't think these parent's are hallucinating when saying their childs seizures went from hundreds a day to 2. This is factual, these parents are telling the truth. A caregiver can be anybody that wants to sign up with the department of health and to get a card that says you can give out marijuana. And that card, is going to limit your ability to give marijuana to only 5 people. How many of you in this room think that if you get a card That everybody is only going to give it to five people. That somebody's not gonna give it to 6 or 56 , or a thousand and 6. There's not enough cops in the state of Florida to keep the bad actor from doing the bad thing. I'm not talking about epilepsy, I'm not talking about people that are going to do it the right way. I'm talking about people that abuse the system. Let's assume the state persues no additional regulations when it comes to who can be a caregivers under amendment 2. Which no one actually thinks will happen, but let's just assume that for the sake of argument. Under the abuser scenarios of the caregiver The drug dealer protection act, as the advertisements from the other side like to call amenment 2. This drug dealer, is assigned by a patient somehow. Um, registers themselves with the state of Florida. Recieves an identification card from the state of Florida. This drug dealer. Goes to a government regulates facility, where purchases are tracked, where security cameras are all over the place. Purchases marijuana there. And then goes on to sell that marijuana to 6 or 7 patients or however many. It is an absolutely false, ludicrous argument. It's intentially vague, because it's left up to the department of health of Florida, to make all these rules and regulations. So if the department of health wants a marijuana treatment center on every corner, they'll allow it. If they want a certain type of caregiver to have a background check they'll make sure that caregivers have background checks. This is about providing an option to doctors. This is about providing an option to very sick and suffering Floridians. This is about providing relief and compassion to the sickest and most desperate amongst us as Floridians. I had a fair number of patients who realized that when they were smoking marijuana their seizure frequency decreased. And I had a few patients that became seizure free. But, I had four patients that became severely psychotic. Senate bill .1030, people refer to it as the charlotte's web bill. Charlotte's web is a brand, it's now a trademark. So, everytime we say it. We're putting money into the pockets of those who own that trademark. They'll be many different strains out there with many different properties of the charlotte's web strain, and basically the Senate Bill .1030 calls for a minimum of 10% CBD and no more than .8% of THC. It's really important to note that there's nothing inherently special about charlotte's web that any strain that is CBD rich um, may have the same effects as what people are calling charlotte's web. and that we have yet to define what CBD rich marijuana actually is. Rather than talk about high THC and low CBD let's just talk about whether you're going to get high off marijuana or you're not going to get high off marijuana. It's either euphoric, you get high or non-euphoric, you don't get high. charlotte's web is designed to be non-euphoric, and that's what the parents asked for, and that's what the legislature gave them. Didn't give them everything they wanted, but that's the way the legislative process works in our country from washington DC down to every state in our country. We should not have limitations. Our government should not dicate to us as a patient and get between me and my doctor, by saying, well you can have this medicine but you can only have .8% THC and a minimum of 10% CBD. We know that children in other states who are having success, with a high CBD low THC oil, their using THC that's above the .8% that's allowed in Florida. So my point is, what happens if my daughter is one of those children who needs 1.5% THC. She won't be able to get it here in Florida, with Senate bill .1030. My daughter should have all options, and the only way she'll get all options is from amendment 2. If you were sick and perhaps dying of cancer, the high itself which you get from THC in and of itself has a medicinal benefit. Having cancer, staring down the barrel of death is a depressing, anxiety ridden process. And part of the medicinal benefit for cancer patients with the use of marijuana is that little moment of euphoria during their day. and the relief from the anxiety that accompanies suffering from a horrible debilitating disease. But if we're going to be able to know what the effect of charlotte's web We're going to need it to be given in the same dosage, in the same manner, to patients. We need to have control groups. We need to have a double-blind study. That's going to take money, and it's going to take time to do it. We need to get started now, Because in 3,4,or 5 years when results start to come in. Doctors like on the either side of me, are going to be able to look at that research data and understand how it helps people. Even if people with epilepsy can benefit from this particular configuration of chemical composition under Charlotte's web or senate bill .1030. It doesn't help everyone. People with cancer, will not be helped by this bill. People with ALS, lou gehrig's disease, parkinsons, multiple sclerosis, H.I.V. A.I.D.S. will not be helped by this bill. We're not concerned with good parents getting, um getting medicinal marijuana from good doctors. Let me make that clear, we're not against that. Because there's are going to be good doctors and there's going to be parents just like you, just like my family, who has people with seizures, and who have cancer. That have all of these other things, and they need this. And there's no problem with that, what we are concerned with are the abuses. How could people sit on these panels, and oppose something that may save my daughters life. I just don't get it, they'd rather me give my daughter a veterinary drug, that could cause brain damage and kill her. I agree that as parents, we should stand up and demand that that change. That's the crux of the problem is that we don't have the information that we need right now, in order to treat our children. And to know whether this is an effective treatment for our children we don't know what the risks are, we really don't know what the risks are. Not everyone is going to sign that waiver, to allow their children to be put on veterinary medications. Not every parent, is going to want to treat their child with a CBD enriched oil, but the passage of amendment 2 in particular is about providing those options. To you as parents, and to your physicians. [Music] So what they wanted to do was test the difference, what's the difference between a mouse with cannabinoid receptors, a normal mouse and one of these knockout mice, without cannabinoid receptors. And they developed this test called the Morse Water Maze. And what happened is there's a big four foot tank. They fill it with water. They have a TV camera overhead. They have directional markers on the inside of the tank. And they place a subsurface stage, somewhere in the tank, you can't see it. And what they do is, they throw the mice in there and they swim around. And eventually they run into the stage and they can stand up and save themselves, holding their head up above water without swimming. Well they train these mice, and they do this repeatedly over a week or two. And after a while, you throw a mice in and they swim right to the thing, because they know where it is. What they do is they repeat that experiment, what they do is move that subsurface stage, over to a different location. And they throw regular mice, and the regular mice swim to where it used to be, they test the enviroment, they swim around and around, and they can't find it. And they do what everybody would do, they look somewhere else. So they swim around, and eventually find it, saving themselves. But the knockout mice are perculiar. They will swim continuously where it used to be until they drown. Even if you pick them up and put them on the stage at the new location, they deny reality, and jump off the stage, and swim where it used to be until they drown. And, so they do repetitive negative behavior despite having feedback that it's not working. And they continue doing this negative behavior until they kill themselves. And they deny reality when it's shown to them. [Music] I was following California law, I had a collective in california and I was doing everything by the book and I got arrested. And I didn't think that could happen. I thought we had passed a law and I was following it. So everything was okay, and I come to find out that not only was nothing okay, but when I reached out to activist organizations for help they didn't know what to do. In 2004, there was a gamechanger. That was called Senate Bill .420. We finally got, 8 years after it passed, we finally got enabling legislation enacted. And the distribution method that this legislation setup was collectives and cooperatives. It says that patients may assemble collectively and cooperatively to cultivate their own medicine. Now, just what does that mean I'm not sure, no one really knows. But it at least was something. And so we started forming these collectives. Where patients would come together and we would grow our marijuana someplace and distribute it to the members of the collectives. Well some of these collectives started growing pretty big. One thousand, two thousand, three thousand, four thousand five thousand members or more. And when you are going to be distributing something to five thousand people you're going to have to have something called a distribution center. And in this country, we call distribution centers that provide things to people, stores. Wallmart is a distribution center. And so stores, operated by these collectives, started opening up on mainstreet, in cities throughout California, and the cops went nuts. I had a very serious case in mississippi, charges about Cannabis crimes. And I reached out to every national organization that I could to try and get help with my plight, being charged with cannabis. It turns out very few people fight their cases. And there wasn't anyone to stand up for those that did. And so I went at it, and started fighting my case and I asked people for help and it came together, and I sort of built this little group. I was in jail pre-trail. Denied bail, they came to get me and put me in a red jumpsuit. Signifying the dangerous nature of my cannabis crime. And they took me to court in pascagoula, mississippi. It was a very bad storm coming through pascagoula, mississippi at that time. And they hauled me into the court in that red jumpsuit and chains. And I was sitting there, listening to the thunder and the lightning. And the head narc, jackie trussell was put on the stand to testify. And all this time, I'm praying that I was going to have some sort of intervention, because I was in that courtroom alone. With nobody on my side. Many of the cases involve transportation, where somebody got pulled over and they had medicine that the law enforcement determined was for sale. And how they do that, is they look for anything they can make it look like it's for sale. So if they find any money, or if your medicine is in more than one container. Or there's more than a little bit. Um, they look for anything that says you were just selling it you were't using it for your own personal, there's no legitimate use. You know when proposition 216 passed in 1996 patients did absolutely nothing with this grounbreaking piece of legislation. They just, they just sort of took this polly otta pollyanna attitude. That our elected officials and the police would say well look, the voters of california have passed this measure to allow doctors to prescribe medical marijuana Let's see what we can do to implement the will of the voters. No, that's not what happened. We should have been on the steps of the state legislature the day after that initiative was voted on and passed, demanding that the legislature, enact enabling legislation. But we didn't, we didn't do anything. But the cops, nuh uh. They started working against it right away. And no matter what the law says, people are still getting arrested. More people are getting arrested in California, to date, 18 years after we passed our law, then ever before we had a law. So legalisation, is not necessarily the answer. [Laughing] This is not an issue that the public really cares about. They try to make it look like, oh the public is all incensed about these collectives opening up. No their not. No, they don't want them across the street from schools. And they don't want to have five of them on one block and stuff. But having them licensed, and regulated and orderly The public's not opposed to that. Prohibition exists because of a policy of deceit and misinformation, and hiding the truth. So the difference, really is the truth. People that don't know the truth, tend to be more against it. People that know the truth tend to be more for it. [Music] We're going to change the law here in Florida. We have more sick and dying people that any other state, I think, in the country we need to make sure that they have access to the healthcare that they need. We need to step back, we need to take a very serious look at this. And what we need to do is fund research. Get the data that these doctors were talking about, that we are supportive of. So we can say a year, two years, three years down the road from now But if you take X, for this many days it will have this impact on a patient. And that's where we need to get to. This amendment won't drive that kind of data or research. I'm nervous because the anti- marijuana advocates are very well organized, they're very well funded. While we have been at it trying to get patient access for about a year and a half to two years now They are just starting, with a fresh bank roll. United for Care polling says 70% of Floridian's want medical marijuana in Florida. And we're pretty confident that it is going to pass. Right now, the polls are looking good I believe some of the latest polls are saying 70 or 80 percent approve of marijuana. Now don't forget that in Florida it is a constitutional amendment that is proposed, so we do need a 60% vote for it to pass. So the numbers are good at the moment. There's a lot of people behind this industry. You know, when we do a lot of our speaking arrangments at the seminars and business summits that go on in south florida. There's a lot of activity. People are excited. It's coming, at the end of the day it's honestly coming. I hope that Florida does things the right way. I hope Florida takes a different approach than everybody else. We have a few other states that we can at least take a small blueprint from and run from. This should be put into a law, so we can change it when things change. As we understand what the impact could be on dosage on strength all of those things. We can change a law, we just can't change a constitutional amendment that easily. There's issues, you know, there is a Ben Franklin to this. There's some positives and there's some negatives. You know, and the positives just far outweight the negative. And it any decision in life, when you have overwhelmingly positive you know, influence and impact on society it's something that you go with. We've got 37 states right now, that's a vast majority of the country in some way shape or form are pro marijuana. And I think that the federal government needs to step in and say okay, we need to think about taking it off that schedule 1 list. When it's schedule 1, it's automatically default under the law there are no medicinal purposes, and I think there's been proven that there are medicinal purposes now. I think it's going to be a groundbreaking year, I think we're going to get turnout that we've never seen. I think that we're going to have people from all walks, from all ages, from all political parties all voting for this issue. I think it's really changed, I think we're really seeing people in favor of this. They weren't sure they've heard all the negatives and now they've been able to hear the positives, to hear the stories. And we need to get them out and make sure that we pass. And I think that's what's going to happen. And I think it's going to be a great year for Florida. And we gotta make sure that we get the medicine to the patients are quickly as possible thereafter. [Music] So right now, there are a lot of issues that come into play. One thing you need to realize is that you have the federal government, where it's illegal. It's a schedule 1 drug. And then you have the state government. And of course anything federal trumps state. So now you have all these states, where now they yeah, they have it on their laws where you can use marijuana whether it's recreational or medical but at the end of the day every single person that is touching the plant is breaking a federal law. So it's tough, sorta, to figure out exactly what to do. You know, there are memos from the U.S. Attorney General saying there not going to touch marijuana in states where they have regulations. But, still at the end of the day you're breaking a federal law. You know, if you have a new administration coming in they could just come in and say, you know, no more marijuana and cut it completely out, and start to enforce it. Now of course, the other thing you'll see is right now, there are actually 37 states that have marijuana which can be used in some way shape or form. There are only 13 states at the moment that have a full prohibition on marijuana. There are 37 states that have some sort of low THC such as in Florida right now we have a low THC before the amendment 2 Right now, you can actually get it as long as it's below .8% THC charlotte's web, which is a typical strain that they use is legal right now in Florida. So there are actually 37 states that have marijuana that can be used legally in some way shape or form, at least within that state at the moment. So that's the other issues that will sort of be, um, might have to be addressed, is that if you have the federal government come in and shutting it down you've got 37 states that are going to come in and say, hey, you're going to destroy our marijuana industry, you're going to take away our tax money. It's going to cause a problem. You basically don't want to start another civil war is what it comes down to. So it's getting to the point where the federal government basically needs to do something. Cannabis had just become legal, in the first state ever, in the United States, Colorado. We heard about it, heard all the things on the news but we really wanted to see for ourselves. So the Cannabis Cup was coming up we got some press passes and decided, we're gonna go. Not knowing what we were going to find. Not knowing where it was going to take us. [Music] Happy 420! [Cheering] [Music] They don't want to abandon their place in line, but they see the fun Do we have any dabstars in the crowd? Come on get loud! [Cheering] [Music] I'm here at the Denver Cannabis Cup, for High Times. 420, 2014. What a beautiful day. [Music] Look at this place, these are all weed people. All of them. This guy, that guy, this guy. We are all weed people. See we all come together for a purpose that marijuana should be legalized. First of all in California. Let's get that set and done. Then we would like to talk about it getting legalized, federally. Recreational use, all 50 states. Tax it, do what Colorado has done so well. Places like The Clinic. Companies like WeedMaps, helping it grow in a positive light. I'm going to be leading a yoga class, it's called moving prana hatha yoga and cannabis. When we are looking at the idea of the yoga practice, it can be considered a spiritual practice. A practice that gives you a mystical experience so to speak. And cannabis has always been hand in hand with that. So, allowing cannabis to be recreational, allows it to be used in a more spiritual context. Not necessarily religious either, just with the spirit. I come from the military, and I'm probably the last person you would expect to see at this event. But, I truly believe in this plant, I think it's a great product. I think that, if we do it the right way, we educate people and be responsible then cannabis is going to be around for a long time. We came from a very far away country. We are the first country in the world that legalized marijuana. And for us it is a very important responsibility to show the world, what Uraguay has been doing. To learn from Colorado and let Colorado learn from us also. [Music] We've got some really good flower strains. The cool thing is that our flower comes straight from production So the same thing we pull that we put in this cup, the same thing that's here today, is giong to be the same thing that's on our shelves. Well, eat to treat. And do it responsibly people. You know, and last but not least, cheers to goodness man. Whenever you're cooking THC there's a certain level of heat you can release onto it. The cleanest level is going to be at 7 minutes at 145 degrees celsius. and this is the only machine that let's you do that for the exact 7 minutes. [Music] I'm actually very proud of the progession of marijuana over the last couple of years. Uh, especially in the Colorado model. Obviously I'm a little particular or biased towards Colorado, because I'm here. But I do follow the news fairly closely in the other states. In my opinion I really feel like Colorado's got it right. So we had a very progressive model, in the case that we started slow with medical. Uh, allowing the companies to grow six plants per patient. Which only allowed the companies to grow so fast. That gave the state the time to really build the laws up and regulate the industry slowly and patch the holes as we went along. And then, we did recreational and they already had a good look at how the industry worked to get to this point Because there's a ton of regulation and I don't think a lot of people understand how hard it is to write regulation and how many people are actually involved in that. I feel the recreational taxes that have been imposed upon cannabis are extremely high. Right now, what I think they should have done is some sort of pilot program to introduce people to the legal market of cannabis. Right now, I worry that some people who don't qualify for a Red card in any of the other legal states they might think I can get it cheaper from a friend or unfortunately a dealer. The other thing is it allowed us as companies to grow slowly and shirley and no one really got out of control because at this point and time the big money comes in from these other states and it gets really hard to grow slow when you have these big zero's behind you that are offering to do this and they just want you to continue to grow as fast as possible so. It really takes a lot of discipline to be able to grow slowly. And not get ahead of yourself. Now the state kinda forced us to do that so nobody got too outa control. [Music] [Blow torch sound] You gotta work the crowd, you gotta work the crowd. [Music] The movement of marijuana is just part of the trailblazing that is taking place and it's part of history. So, everyday that we are out here doing this, I know that we are changing people perceptions and minds. on the positive effects of cannabis and I see this as a social policy movement. It is so awesome to be back in the cannabis capital of the world for this epic 420 weekend. Thank you. There's a question on the November ballot you may be puzzled over It's amendment 2 and it asks it medical marijuana should be legal in Florida. Supporters and detractors are spending millions of dollars on ads to win your vote. If amendment 2 on the ballot passes, the state house and senate will write the rules and regulations. News 4 jax investigator vic micolucci has been digging deeper talking with legislators on both sides of the debate about the job they could face next spring. [Music] You know, it's time for change. This needs to be changed. We go 23 , 24 states it's already legal in. Medically. And that's all we want here. This isn't for kids, it's not to be abused, it's for the people that need it. And there's a lot of them, thousands and thousands of them out there that need it. But I'll say this, being born in 1971 I never thought I would see it in my lifetime to be honest with you. Um, So I am just super excited to be a part of it In any small way I can, waving the sign. Talking to people who are coming to vote, who may have questions. Um, thrilled to be a part of it. [Music] This is election night, we are watching the results come in for amendment 2 tonight my feelings are, there are still quite a few votes to be counted but as of right now, we have about 57% of the vote. Which is a larger share of the vote than the last 6 governors in the state of Florida have been elected with. So a huge majority of Florida voters have voted yes on amendment 2, yes on medical marijuana. And clearly the people of Florida want a medical marijuana law. Veterans for cannabis is an organization I started because what we are finding is that 22 veterans a day are commiting suicide with post dramatic stress disorder. And what's happening is I can tell you personally from my personal experience, because I had PTSD from vietnam the anti-psychotics they gave me, definitely made me suicidal. I wanted to end my own life, I couldn't take it anymore. I got off all drugs, and every once in a while I use a little cannabis, not everyday. But I use it, and I'm just like, [Breathing] It's not that bad man. So to feel a little better, oh, God forbid I get high. There's no euphoria for me, it's just the relief of pain. Tom, behind me is the campaign headquarters for Yes on 2. A lot of people upset, some emotional. I talked to a couple of women who actually cried when they heard that it did not get the 60% to pass. I've given a lot of thought, I've had the opportunity to speak to a lot of people. Who have, you know, said no. There's actually a significant percentage of them tonight saying no. And I have put a lot of time trying to figure out why. Why would somebody say no, to an issue, that is an issue of compassion. Because I don't want to be the only patient in Florida using this medicine. That's legal. I want patients to have the right, I want doctors to have the right to take care of patients in this state. That's what we send them to school for. That's what they pay to go to school for. They've become doctors, they should make this decision. And the opposition says, gee, they can recommend it for anything. Because any debilitating disorder. Well guess what the doctor can recommend oxycontin for any debilitating disorder they deem necessary. What's the difference. It's a medicine. Treat it like one. The amendment was written to establish basic rights and principles. Because you don't want all the regulations in an amendment. You have to realize, that everytime you change or want to change one of those regulations you need a 60% vote again. So the amendment limited itself to the basic rights and principles. And then allow the department of health to come in and write regulations. That's exactly the way it should be done. That's the responsible way to write an amendment. Only in Florida do you get 58% and not win. Alright we have won. We have sent a huge message to the policitians in tallahassee that this is not a poll this is not a bill filed by and activist or legislature. This is a huge majority of Florida voters who want medical marijuana. And their gonna get it whether the politicians and legislature in tallahassee give it to them or that we have to go back to the ballot in 2016. Medical marijuana is coming to the state of Florida because the people of Floridawant a medical marijuana law. See to us, we've already won. Because, to have this in a public place. Okay, talking about medical marijuana. I've been doing this for 20 years, My wife has been sick for 28 with ALS Okay, we've been screaming , screaming for something like this to happen. Okay, nobody paid attention. My home got raided. John Morgan jumped in got the money got the seniors, now this. So we've already won. We've won as far as I'm concerned. They can't put the cat back in the bag. If it don't happen this year, it'll come out in 2016. I guarentee you one thing when we go back to tallahassee and talk to the legislators They will pay attention, they will. They won't have a choice. People are always going to medicate themselves. Nothing is going to change. I mean because, again, their breaking the law, which is sad. But, when you have a devastating disorder like I do and other people do. Hey, look, all you care about is getting the best medicine possible. If somebody says that this best medicine is illegal They're not a criminal. But they are going to take care of their medical needs. Okay. And I don't think there's anything wrong with that. And thank got in the state of Florida we do have a medical necessity defense. Which we still will have no matter what happens tonight. So if, the 63 sheriffs want to go after all these patients and arrest them for using their medicine go right ahead. Because I'm prepared as a federal patient, to be at each and every one of those trials, to say hey look, the federal government has been giving me this medicine for 32 years, and you're trying to arrest this patient for using the same medicine the federal government is giving me? This is one battle, this is not the war. We feel very strongly that this movement will continue just as strong. We know that the people of Florida agree with medical marijuana. In this particular case, due to A lot of disingenuous messaging and a lot of money from out of state it did not pass, but we feel that the people of Florida do certainly support the concept. And we believe that this will eventually be a reality here in Florida. It must, we have 23 states and the district of Columbia We have 5 recreational states. We are almost at an absolute majority. I think acceptance continues to grow, and as acceptance continues to grow again, you know, it's back towards natural solutions. And I can't see it any clearer than, we have to get to the point where we use sythetic substances as the second step but first we try to do it naturally. The biggest problem we have it apathy, we don't vote, we don't get out. We like to smoke our pot but we don't like doing much else. We like to show up as a concert, we like to come to party, but we don't like to get out there and make a difference. So, It's all on us we just have to change it. I think the states one by one are going to go. I think Florida is the biggest state right now. Um, because that will be the domino for the south. And we're going national now. how Florida goes, the rest of the south is going to go and when the rest of the south goes the rest of the country goes. You're seeing this drug war in the dying days. People are waking up to it. It does have a huge place in the world medicinally, a huge place in the world economically, and a huge place in the world recreationally. I guess I never thought that cannabis could actually be legal. Going to Colorado really opens your mind into the future is what it really is, the future where humans are going back to our roots. Going away from these prescription drugs and going back to natural remedies going back to the things we were given by nature. Instead of, always using science to out trick nature, we use nature to fix nature. Right now, the federal government has taken a back seat. So long as the state has it's own regulations. Now of course, in states that don't have regulations California poses a little bit of a problem here because, their regulations are not tight enough in the industry they might get in trouble. Once these things start, they may get bumps in the road and slow down, but they more or less keep rolling down the hill. By ten years, I bet at least half the states have it legalized total recreational legalized. Um, I see maybe medical even thought I'm in the medical, I see it maybe going by the wayside. Because once you legalize it, you don't need the medical aspect of it. I think that it's going to continue to legalize in states, um, I think that it's going to continue to be an uphill battle for a long time, I don't see federal legalization in our future. There's a lot of folks that talk about the possibility of rescheduling cannabis I think at some point we are going to see a very crippling federal tax applied. Um, Everybody has to make their money somehow in the government. Look at Colorado. Look at Washington. Now these are two states that legalized marijuana. And, January 1st of the first stores opened up in the state of Colorado selling recreational marijuana to anybody over the age of 21. And for years, the anti-marijuana people. The, professional drug warriors if you will. Have been saying, all, and for years they've been doing this , these stories of the sky will fall in if marijuana became legal. You would have children smoking all over the place. There would be a blood bath on our nations highways from all the stoned drivers. People, our emergency rooms in our hospitals would be overflowing with people. We would have maniacs running down the streets. And what's happened in Colorado? Nothing! [Music] Medical marijuana got the thumbs up from voters here in the sunshine state amendment 2 passed after a narrow defeat two years ago, Take a look at the final results. 71% of voters said yes. It needed at least 60% to become law. A group of supporters erupted in cheers after hearing the outcome. Amendment 2 expands the conditions eligible for medical marijuana use. Including PTSD, crohn's disease, parkinsons, and AIDS. Moving forward the department of health will continue to monitor the list of Floridians who are eligible They still would have to get approval from a doctor certified through the states department of compassionate use. There are only 180 in this state, but that number may increase. Supporters say this decision, will change their lives. [Music] We want to turn to the historic night, here in california what effects you the most. Voters legalized the recreational use of marijuana. Here's a look at the prop 64 results, with 38% of precincts reporting, the yes's have it with 56%, no's 44%. [Music]
