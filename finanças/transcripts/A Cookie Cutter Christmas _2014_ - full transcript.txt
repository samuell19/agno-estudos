NOT ONLY DID SHE SING MY VERSES, BUT SHE ALSO PURPOSELY SANG LOUDER THAN ME SO THAT NO ONE ELSE COULD HEAR ME. WELL, I COULD HEAR YOU. WELL, YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE.

WHY DO YOU HAVE TO MAKE EVERYTHING A COMPETITION WITH ME? OH, PLEASE. I THINK YOU ARE THE ONE WHO STARTED THAT WITH THE WHOLE SILENT NIGHT THING? IF YOU REMEMBER, IT WAS MY SOLO, CHRISTIE. THE CHOIR TEACHER ONLY GAVE YOU THOSE LINES SO YOU'D STOP COMPLAINING. APPARENTLY, THAT DIDN'T REALLY WORK OUT. YOU'RE JUST MAD BECAUSE SOPHIE NAILED HER AUDITION TODAY. OH, PLEASE. WELL, DON'T YOU LOOK NICE. HEADING OVER TO THE FESTIVAL? NOT TODAY. I'VE GOT TO GO TUTOR LILY, A NEW STUDENT IN MY CLASS, THEN I HAVE TO COME UP WITH A COOKIE FOR THE FIRST ROUND TOMORROW. IS LILY'S FATHER THE ONE THAT OWNS THE DONATION CENTER? MM-HMM, THAT'S THE ONE. HMM. NO WONDER YOU LOOK SO NICE. MOM... [CHUCKLING] WHAT? IS IT CRAZY FOR A MOTHER TO WISH HER DAUGHTER WOULD GET SETTLED? LOOK, I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT TEACHING IS TO YOU, BUT TRUST ME WHEN I SAY YOUR LIFE WOULD BE EVEN MORE FULFILLED IF YOU HAD A PARTNER TO SHARE IT WITH. LOOK AT ME AND YOUR FATHER. HE LOST HIS WIFE, MOM. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE. I DO. BUT I CAN ALSO SAY THAT IF I WERE STILL YOUNG WHEN I LOST YOUR FATHER, I'D WANT TO FIND HAPPINESS AGAIN. YOU ARE STILL YOUNG, MOM. [GRUMBLES] WHAT ABOUT YOUR HAPPINESS NOW? YOU KNOW, I'D BETTER GO. I PROMISED I WOULD HELP OUT AT THE BAKING TABLE. ENJOY YOUR DAY. [CHRISTIE]: ALL RIGHT, HERE IS THE PROBLEM. SOMEONE HAS GIVEN YOU $50 AS A GIFT. HOW MANY OF THOSE ITEMS WOULD YOU NEED TO BUY IN ORDER TO SPEND ALL OF THAT MONEY? DONE. LET ME SEE. THAT LOOKS GREAT, AND I LOVE THAT YOU SHOWED YOUR WORK, BUT YOU STILL HAVE $10 WITH WHICH YOU COULD BUY ANOTHER ITEM. I KNOW, BUT I DON'T WANT TO. IF I HAD $50, I WOULD WANT TO AT LEAST GIVE SOME TO CHARITY. THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, IF YOU'D SHOWN ME THAT IN YOUR WORK, I WOULD HAVE GIVEN YOU AN "A." HOW'S THE TUTORING GOING? GREAT. REALLY GOOD. UNFORTUNATELY, I HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE. THE OFFICIAL BAKE-OFF STARTS TOMORROW, AND I STILL HAVE TO COME UP WITH A COOKIE. I THINK A CHOCOLATE COOKIE WOULD WIN. REALLY? AND HOW DO YOU FIGURE THAT? BECAUSE EVERYBODY LOVES CHOCOLATE. [LAUGHS] THAT'S A GOOD POINT. WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT? ALL RIGHT, WELL, WISH ME LUCK.

YES, SOPHIE? WHY AREN'T WE GIVING THE MONEY FROM THE BAKE CONTEST TO CHARITY? OH, UM... [BELL RINGS] OKAY, GUYS, UM, YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY. -GREAT JOB TODAY. -YOU TOO. I'LL SEE YOU SOON. AND YOU TOO. THANK YOU. [JAMES]: WHICH ONE IS MINE? I DON'T KNOW. THERE SHE IS. GO GET YOUR JACKET. BYE. WELL, THAT'S A... SERIOUS LOOK. SORRY, I'M JUST... TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ANSWER A QUESTION. WELL-- YOO-HOO! THIS IS FOR YOU. IT'S AN INVITE TO A CHRISTMAS GATHERING THAT I HOST FOR ALL OF THE FESTIVAL VOLUNTEERS AND RECIPIENTS. OH. SINCE WHEN? SINCE THIS YEAR. WELL, THANK YOU, MS. MILLER. CHRISTIE, I ASSUME YOU'LL BE GOING, TOO? OF COURSE. I AM A VOLUNTEER AFTER ALL. WELL, GREAT. I'LL SEE YOU BOTH AT THE FESTIVAL ON SATURDAY, THEN? GREAT, AND SEEING AS HOW OUR VERY OWN CHEF KRUEGER HAS OFFERED TO DO A PRESENTATION OF HIS COOKING SKILLS, COMPLIMENTS OF YOURS TRULY. WELL, EXCELLENT. I WILL MAKE SURE NOT TO MISS THAT. SO I'LL SEE YOU, LADIES. OKAY. YEAH. [CLEARS THROAT AWKWARDLY] SO... DO I GET AN INVITATION? I'LL BE SURE TO STUFF IT IN YOUR INBOX. BYE, MS. REYNOLDS. SO, ANOTHER DAY DONE. GREAT. SO... HOW'S SHE DOING? SHE'S DOING GREAT, AND I THINK SHE'LL BE ALL CAUGHT UP BY CHRISTMAS. AMAZING. THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME. UM, SHE'S-SHE'S VERY BRIGHT. YEAH. ANYWAY, UM, I SHOULD... I SHOULD PROBABLY GET HOME AND GET STARTED ON MY NEXT COOKIE. OH... HOW'S THAT GOING? HONESTLY, I'M NOT THE MASTER CHEF I THOUGHT I WAS. OH, I'M SURE IT'S NOT THAT BAD. MY COOKIES DEFLATED BEFORE MY EYES. WELL, WHY DON'T YOU LET ME HELP YOU OUT? I MEAN, AFTER ALL YOU'VE DONE FOR LILY? IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO. REALLY? LIKE, YOU WOULD... YOU WOULD TEACH ME? YEAH. IF YOU'RE FREE, WHY DON'T YOU COME OVER, LIKE SATURDAY AFTERNOON, AND, YEAH, WE'LL START BAKING 101. THAT WOULD BE AMAZING. I WILL BE THERE. WELL, PERFECT, YEAH. GREAT. I SWEAR, EVERY YEAR IT GETS HARDER AND HARDER TO FIND A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR ROY. I MEAN, WHAT DOES THE MAN NEED? NOTHING! HE HAS ENOUGH COFFEE MUGS AND TIES TO LAST A LIFETIME. [LAUGHING] OH, HEY, I KNOW, WHY DON'T WE GO TO THAT NEW MALL THIS SATURDAY? I CAN'T, ACTUALLY. I, UM, I HAVE A BAKING LESSON. FROM WHO? UM... JAMES. THE NEW HOT DAD? SO, WHAT IS THIS LESSON ALL ABOUT? [CHUCKLING] NOTHING. BAKING, I DON'T KNOW. MM-HMM. LILY, HIS DAUGHTER, TOLD ME THAT I MIGHT WANT TO ASK HER DAD FOR HELP, BECAUSE HE'S APPARENTLY AN INCREDIBLE COOK. MM-HMM, MM-HMM, AND YOU WOULDN'T HAVE ANY ULTERIOR MOTIVES FOR THIS, WOULD YOU? NO, I WOULDN'T. I TOLD YOU, I WANT TO WIN, AND IT WOULDN'T BE CHEATING, BECAUSE I'D STILL COME UP WITH MY OWN RECIPE. HE WOULD JUST TEACH ME THAT... JE NE SAIS QUOI. I'M SURE HE COULD. [LAUGHING] LET'S GO OVER THERE. SO, WHAT I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU NOW IS WHAT EVERY CHEF KNOWS IS THE SECRET TO WINNING OVER TASTE BUDS-- SWEET AND SALTY-- THE BEST FLAVOR COMBINATION EVER. REALLY? I THOUGHT IT WAS ALWAYS ONE OR THE OTHER. WELL, THAT IS WHY I'M THE MASTER CHEF. OH, PERFECT. THE SUGAR IS JUST ABOUT TO MELT. NOW, DID YOU NOTICE BEFORE WE SET UP, I HAD ALL THE INGREDIENTS, THE UTENSILS AND THE BAKE TRAY ALL OUT AT ROOM TEMPERATURE? A LITTLE BAKER'S SECRET. OH. NOW LET'S SEE HOW FAR YOU'VE COME WITH YOUR COOKIE BASE THERE. COME OVER HERE SO I CAN SEE IT, AND THAT WAY, YOU CAN ALSO HELP ME WITH THE SAUCE. OKAY, NOT BAD. YEAH, MAYBE A LITTLE LESS BUTTER NEXT TIME. THAT COULD BE WHY YOUR COOKIES ARE DEFLATING, AND JUST-- HERE. HOLD IT LIKE THIS... THERE YOU GO. SHAKE HANDS WITH THE SPOON, AND JUST GENTLY FOLD. YEAH, YOU DON'T WANT TO OVER-MIX. EASY. THERE WE GO. GOOD. SO, HAVE YOU, UM, HAVE YOU EVER ENTERED ANY COOKING OR BAKING CONTESTS? NO, NO, NOT FOR ME. WHY NOT? YOU'RE SUCH A GREAT COOK, AND YOU OBVIOUSLY LOVE IT. WELL, THAT'S EXACTLY WHY. I DON'T WANT TO RUIN IT WITH COMPETITION. I'VE DONE ALL THAT FOR 10 YEARS IN CORPORATE AMERICA. WAIT. WAIT, REALLY? YOU WERE A CORPORATE MAN? HOW COME I CAN'T PICTURE THAT? HEY, I LOOKED PRETTY SHARP IN A SUIT. [TIMER BEEPS] OH, AND... OUR CARAMEL IS DONE. WE MADE CARAMEL? WE DID. NOW, SO TECHNICALLY, I SHOULD LET THIS COOL DOWN A LITTLE BIT, BUT, UH, IT'S SO GOOD. IT'S A LITTLE HOT, SO... THIS IS THE SWEET. AND THIS IS THE SALTY. THAT WAS... SO... GOOD. SO GOOD, I TOLD YOU. WE SHOULD FINISH YOUR DOUGH, AND, UH, GET YOUR COOKIES GOING. GREAT. GOOD JOB. THANKS. YOU TOO. YEAH, THANK YOU. SO, THE SWEET SPOT ON BAKING COOKIES IS YOU WANT TO BAKE THEM UNTIL THEY GET THAT NICE BROWN EDGE AROUND THEM. THAT WILL GIVE YOU THAT CRISPY, BUT, YOU KNOW, MELT-IN-YOUR-MOUTH TEXTURE YOU WANT. SO JUDGING BY THESE, I'M SAYING TWO MORE MINUTES. GREAT. SO, IS THIS YOUR SACRED COOKBOOK THAT LILY WAS TELLING ME ABOUT? UM, YEAH, WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO KNOW? [LAUGHING] EXCUSE ME. NO, IT'S FINE, I DON'T NEED TO LOOK AT IT. IT'S PROBABLY JUST FULL OF OLD, CRUMB-FILLED RECIPE CARDS. OH... [LAUGHING] WELL, HARDLY. I SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE. NO, THESE... THESE RECIPES ARE ALL MINE. I'VE WORKED FOR EVEN YEARS ON THEM TRYING TO PERFECT THEM, SO... MM-HMM. BE GENTLE. ALL RIGHT. OKAY, WHAT HAVE WE HERE? OOH, PEPPERMINT DROPS. THESE ARE ONE OF MY FAVORITES. SO, YOU, WHAT ABOUT YOU? WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE TO GO INTO TEACHING? THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT BEING ABLE TO MOLD THE MINDS OF KIDS THAT'S JUST REALLY EXCITING TO ME. YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT. I MEAN, WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH LILY ALONE, ALREADY. I MEAN, YOU'VE REALLY... YOU'VE REALLY HELPED HER. IT'S MEANT A LOT TO HER. AND ME. FUNNY, I EXPECTED YOU TO MAKE THESE HOT CHOCOLATES FROM SCRATCH. WELL, I CAN'T GIVE AWAY ALL MY SECRETS IN ONE GO. ALL RIGHT. SO HOW DID YOU BECOME SUCH A GOOD COOK, THEN? OH, MY MOM, YEAH. SHE LOVED TO COOK, YOU KNOW, SHE WAS ALWAYS IN THE KITCHEN, AND, YOU KNOW, AS AN ONLY CHILD, I FIGURED I'D HELP HER OUT INSTEAD OF DOING NOTHING. AND, YEAH, IT TURNED OUT I LIKED IT. AND ARE ANY OF THOSE RECIPES IN YOUR BOOK HERS? NO, NO HERS ARE WAY TOO GOOD FOR MY BOOK. STOP IT. I'M SURE SHE'S VERY PROUD OF YOU. YEAH, WELL... SHE DOES TELL ME AS MUCH. [CHUCKLING] HEY, THANKS AGAIN FOR TODAY. NO, IT'S MY PLEASURE, NO PROBLEM AT ALL. UNLESS WE'RE BREAKING ANY OF THE BAKE-OFF RULES. NO. NO, WE'RE NOT. IF WE WERE, PENNY WOULD HAVE ME ELIMINATED IMMEDIATELY. YOU KNOW, I'M GETTING THE SENSE THAT YOU TWO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A RIVALRY GOING ON. NOT REALLY, NO. DADDY... LOOK AT THE PUPPIES. OH, MY. CAN WE GET ONE? UH, GET ONE? I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT, WE'LL HAVE TO ASK SANTA, BUT YOU CAN ASK IF YOU CAN PET THEM. UH-HUH. [GASPING AND GIGGLING] [♪♪] GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE! AND WELCOME TO THE SEMI-FINAL ROUND OF THE CHRISTMAS COOKIE BAKE-OFF! [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] NOW, CHEF KRUEGER, IN LIGHT OF WHAT HAPPENED THE LAST ROUND... [CLEARING THROAT AWKWARDLY] EACH COOKIE WILL NOW BE SERVED WITH WHAT ELSE, A GLASS OF MILK. COMPLIMENTS OF YOURS TRULY. NOW, I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY STARTING OFF WITH MR. PETERS AND HIS SANTA HATS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] VERY DECORATIVE. MM-HMM. THANK YOU. AND NOW FOR MY VERY OWN SNOW GLOBES. [APPLAUSE] AH, LET'S SEE. MM. [SIGHS HEAVILY] WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY ANOTHER BITE?

[GASPING IN DISMAY] OH, I'M SO SORRY. I'M SO SORRY. I AM SO, SO SORRY. YES... OH, CHRISTIE, I AM SO SORRY. I GUESS THIS MEANS YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO QUALIFY? I GUESS NOT. [MUMBLES IN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT] THERE YOU GO. WELL, IT SEEMS THAT WE STILL HAVE THREE QUALIFYING CONTESTANTS. AND THE TWO WHO WILL BE ADVANCING TO THE FINAL ROUND ARE... GO, MS. REYNOLDS! MYSELF, AND... MS. REYNOLDS. [CROWD SCREAMS] [CHEERING AND APPLAUDING] [♪♪] [KNOCK ON DOOR] [GASPS] WOW, DON'T YOU LOOK FESTIVE. REALLY? -IS IT TOO MUCH? -NO. I MEAN, WHAT IF PENNY'S JUST WEARING A SKIRT? IT'S BETTER TO BE OVER-DRESSED THAN UNDER-DRESSED IS WHAT I ALWAYS SAY. NOW, JUST GO, HAVE FUN. WHY DON'T YOU JUST COME? IT'LL BE FUN. AND SO MUCH BETTER THAN SITTING HOME ALONE. HONEY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. BESIDES, BEING ALONE IS SOMETHING I HAVE TO GET USED TO. DON'T SAY THAT. WELL, IT'S TRUE. FINE. THEN YOU WILL DEFINITELY HAVE TO MOVE BACK HOME WITH ME. CHRISTIE, I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU. I MEAN, NOT THAT MANY MEN WANT A WOMAN WHO LIVES WITH HER MOTHER. IF I MOVE BACK, I'LL FIND MY OWN PLACE. FINE, BUT I WILL BE OVER THERE ALL THE TIME. [CHUCKLING] NOW, COME ON, WHY DON'T YOU PUT ON THAT CUTE LITTLE RED DRESS YOU ALWAYS WEAR, AND LET'S GO. [MUMBLES NONCOMMITTALLY] COME ON. OKAY. [LAUGHING] CHEF KRUEGER. HOW MUCH FUN DID WE HAVE THE OTHER DAY! WE DID, YES. YES... I WANTED YOU TO TRY ONE OF MY SHRIMP LOLLIPOPS WHILE THEY'RE STILL HOT FROM THE OVEN. MM! OH, WOW, THIS IS REALLY GOOD. WHY THANK YOU, JAMES. THEY HAPPEN TO BE MY OWN RECIPE. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO SHARE IT, IF YOU'D LIKE. AS I WAS SAYING, THE TEST OF A REAL WORLD-CLASS RESTAURANT NOWADAYS IS NOT SO MUCH THE RECIPE OR THE FOOD ITSELF, IT'S THE "IT" FACTOR THAT EVERYBODY LOOKS FOR. TOTALLY, LIKE, CELEBRITY CACHE.. OH, CHRISTIE. I WAS BEGINNING TO THINK YOU WEREN'T GOING TO MAKE IT. SORRY TO DISAPPOINT. PENNY, YOU KNOW MY MOM. YES, HELLO, MRS. REYNOLDS. IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU.

NOW, IT JUST CAME TO MY ATTENTION RECENTLY THAT JAMES HERE IS NOT ONLY A FANTASTIC CHEF, BUT HE IS ALSO QUITE THE MUSICIAN. OH, NO, NO, NO, THAT'S GOING A LITTLE FAR. OH, DON'T BE SO MODEST.

THE LESSONS, THE HELP, MY RECIPE. ALL JUST SO YOU COULD WIN? JAMES, I DIDN'T... I PROMISE, I DIDN'T USE YOUR RECIPE. I CALLED THEM "PEPPERMINT DROPS" BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE, BUT I...

HOW YOU DOING, HONEY? HUH? I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. EVERYTHING WAS GOING SO WELL. HE ASKED ME TO DINNER, AND THEN-- OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT, SWEETIE. NO, IT ISN'T. IF I HADN'T ENTERED THAT STUPID CONTEST, NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED. AND ALL BECAUSE I WAS UPSET THAT PENNY MILLER SANG MY VERSES WHEN WE WERE EIGHT YEARS OLD. SHE WAS RIGHT, TOO, IT WAS HER SOLO. I JUST... I JUST COMPLAINED ENOUGH TO THE TEACHER THAT SHE GAVE ME THOSE VERSES. I SHOULD HAVE JUST LEFT IT ALONE. INSTEAD, I GOT MAD AND LOST A FRIEND. I THINK I MIGHT HAVE LOST JAMES, TOO. [DOORBELL RINGS] THAT'S CHEF KRUEGER. HE'S ASKED ME OUT TO DINNER. I'LL STAY IF YOU WANT. NO, NO, IT'S OKAY. YOU SHOULD GO, REALLY. ARE YOU SURE? PLEASE, IT'LL MAKE ME HAPPY. I WON'T BE GONE LONG. PROMISE. [♪♪] OKAY. NOW, KIDS, WE ARE NO LONGER GOING TO KEEP TRACK OF THE NUMBER OF RAFFLE TICKETS WE'VE SOLD, OR ANYTHING ELSE, FOR THAT MATTER.

DADDY, I THINK YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT MS. REYNOLDS. SHE WOULDN'T CHEAT TO WIN. I KNOW SHE WOULDN'T. WHEN SHE FOUND CONNOR DOUGLAS TRYING TO CHEAT IN CLASS, SHE CALLED HIS PARENTS. TRUST ME. I THINK YOU SHOULD GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE. LILY, IT WAS THE EXACT CARD, OKAY? ...BECAUSE OF YOUR GENEROSITY, WE HAVE ALMOST REACHED OUR FUNDRAISING GOAL OF $10,000. [CHEERING] NOW, BEFORE WE CLOSE THE FESTIVAL, I WOULD LIKE TO AWARD OUR VERY OWN MS. REYNOLDS WITH A CHECK FOR HER WINNING PEPPERMINT DROP COOKIES. [APPLAUSE] WOW. UM... WOW, THANK YOU, EVERYONE. THANK YOU, EVERYONE, FOR YOUR INCREDIBLE SUPPORT. YOU KNOW, CHRISTMAS IS A TIME WHEN WE'RE REMINDED TO GIVE THANKS FOR ALL THAT WE HAVE, AND TO GIVE BACK TO THOSE IN NEED. IT'S ALSO A TIME WHEN WE'RE REMINDED OF WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND WHAT ISN'T. YOU KNOW, WHEN I FIRST ENTERED THIS CONTEST, IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT I WIN. UM, BUT SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY, SOMETHING HAPPENED. I MET SOMEONE WHO TAUGHT ME THAT WINNING ISN'T EVERYTHING. AND THAT SOMETIMES, IN OUR PURSUIT OF WINNING, WE FORGET WHAT'S IMPORTANT. [SNIFFLES] LIKE FRIENDSHIP. I FORGOT A LONG TIME AGO, AND I LOST SOMEONE WHO WAS A REALLY GOOD FRIEND. AM I GLAD THAT I WON? YES, I AM. BECAUSE NOW MY CLASS AND I CAN GIVE THIS CHECK TO THE GREENVILLE CENTER OF HOPE. AN INCREDIBLE CHARITY RUN BY A REALLY INCREDIBLE MAN. AND HIS LITTLE GIRL. SO, THANK YOU.

BUT I'M STILL GOING TO STEAL THAT LAST RECIPE FROM YOU. OF COURSE. I'LL SEE YOU LATER. CHRISTIE? I'M SORRY I STOLE YOUR VERSES. I'M SORRY I TOOK YOUR SOLO. [CHUCKLES] IT'S OKAY. IT PROBABLY SOUNDED BETTER WITH BOTH OF US ANYWAY. PROBABLY. ONE MORE THING. MERRY CHRISTMAS, CHRISTIE. PENNY, SHE... YEAH, SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE TOOK THE RECIPE TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE... YOU TOOK IT. SHE DID? YEAH, BUT PLEASE, DON'T BE ANGRY WITH HER, PLEASE, BECAUSE-- NO, I WON'T. I TOLD YOU, I'M OVER IT. GOOD. I KNOW YOU ARE, AND I AM SO SORRY FOR ASSUMING THE WORST AND NOT BELIEVING IN YOU. I MEAN, YOU'RE THE REASON THAT THE CENTER IS GOING TO HAVE AN INCREDIBLE CHRISTMAS. SO WILL I, IF... YOU FORGIVE ME, AND MAYBE AGREE TO HAVE DINNER WITH ME, AGAIN? SO IT WOULD BE... LIKE A DATE? OH, YEAH, IT WOULD... DEFINITELY A DATE. AND YOU'RE SURE? BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT WOULD... IT WOULD BE OKAY IF YOU WEREN'T READY. I'M READY. OKAY. THEN I WOULD REALLY LOVE THAT...
