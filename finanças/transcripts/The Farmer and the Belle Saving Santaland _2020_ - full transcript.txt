Oh, but I want you to. To read it, to take its words to your heart, that true beauty is here. I'm gonna write to Josh and tell him what you gave me. You'll see him soon enough at Santaland. Your mother's letting me take you this year. I wanna write him. I owe him a letter. "Dear pen pal, "I can't wait 'til I see you at Santaland this year. "It's the only place that really "feels like Christmas, besides Grammy's. "I love the Santaland games, "the Christmas trees, the animals, "and especially all the Christmas treats. "It always feels like magic. "Mom says that Christmas is not important, "I think it is. "Grammy gave me a bracelet that's so pretty. "I can't wait to show you. "I hope it snows this year. "Your pen pal forever, Belle." "Dear pen pal, "This is gonna be the best Santaland ever, "the moment you get here. "I can't wait to see your new bracelet.

It's true. All of it. So, what do you want to be when you grow up? I'm going to own this farm, like my father. Raise hogs. Really? Aren't they really stinky? No, they're not that bad. You're just saying that. No, really. So what do you want to be? My mother says I could be a fashion model, but I don't know. Maybe I could be a farmer, too. A fashion model farmer? Sounds good to me. I'm not sure about the pigs, though. I'll take you to see 'em right now. You'll see. They're great. I could take your picture with them. Fashion model farmer? You're beautiful, Belle. Give me another pose. Great. Get up on the fence. Is this good? Yeah, get up higher. I'll shoot you from down here. Do another pose. I'm so sorry, let me help you up! This is all your fault. I wanna go home. Please, Belle, it's just mud. I'm so sorry, Josh. She wants to go home and I can't change her mind. You have a nice Christmas and tell your father goodbye for me. Please Belle, don't go. We still have to be Joseph and Mary in the nativity. I'm sorry. I can't. Not like this. They laughed at me. Bye, Belle. Don't forget to write. Pen pals forever. Merry Christmas. Why'd you send Grammy home? Because. She brought you home like this. I'm sorry. Josh wanted me to see the pigs. What did I tell you about farms? You were right. It was horrible. The pigs. The people laughed at me. No one will be laughing at you anymore. I don't wanna be a farmer. Good. Give me your shirt. Ugh. Ugh. My bracelet. It's gone. No! I loved that bracelet. Grammy gave it to me. I know which one it was. Costume jewelry. Don't worry about it, Belle. One day, these wrists will have diamonds on them. Just you watch. See how beautiful you are? Your hair.

Wait, hold that. I'm just kidding. Listen, Speaking of swine, that onesie company is starting a brand new marketing campaign: pigs. No pigs, no pigs, no pigs. No, please, please, no pigs. I hate pigs. Belle, baby. Pigs. That's your future. I am not doing pigs! I'm not a pig. No pigs. Hashtag Christmas pigs and Belle. I hate you. I expect to get another angle or two. Belle, Belle, Belle. Hello? Hey, we've got a big problem. I'm sorry. Could you say that again? Just let me talk to Belle. You're so beautiful. It's Vinnie again, urgent. Vinnie, this better not be about pigs. Look, don't hang up. Is there a jumbotron anywhere near you? Looks like Rico has been having too much fun in the sun without you. Looks like the real swine is your fiance. I'm so sorry, Belle. Hey Belle, why can't you be enough for your fiance? A real woman would never get dumped. Come on, let's go. Let's go. Belle. Belle, can I have an autograph? Thank you. Belle, is it true that Rico dumped you? Taxi. It's all on the jumbotron. Have you heard anything new, Belle? How do you feel about that Belle? - Over here. - Over here, come on Belle. You're my favorite. Quack, quack, quack, quack. Now. What else do we do before we go to bed? We like to sing songs, right?

Aww. When I grow up, I wanna marry a farmer. You do? And what kind of farmer are you going to marry? Um, a farmer. He's gonna make me laugh just like you do. Hm, that's very sweet. You make me smile and laugh, too. You know that, kiddo? Where is that smile of yours, little Belle? Did you find anything else for me? Yes. And no. Look, what can I tell you? They want you for the pig thing. They think you're great with animals. Gee, thanks. But listen, I am not doing pigs. That's final. All right, that's fine. Whatever you want. But I also have some good news and it has nothing to do with pigs. - Your smoothie. - Thank you. I have just received a firm offer for you to become the official spokesperson for nature's beauty. Adult diapers. Great pay, and you're perfect for the role. I'm sorry, what? What can I tell you, baby? You're aging out. I thought you told me that I wasn't aging out. I lied, because I love you. Look, Belle, these are good offers. You should think about 'em. I'm not getting any phone calls and believe me, I've been trying. You know you're still my favorite, right? I'm sorry, Vinnie. I gotta go. How is it that you know exactly when I need you? I was hungry. Thought you'd like to go out for dinner. I just got off phone with Vinnie, and he told me I am aging out. I just got offered an adult diaper job. - Adult diapers. - Oh, yuck. - What are you gonna do? - Adult diapers. Am I really getting that old? Well, you're not 21 anymore. You're supposed to help me feel better. Who's gonna love me when my beauty's gone? It's not about looks. Beauty is what's on the inside. I'm sorry. What did you say? Beauty is what's on the inside. Yeah. That was on a bracelet that I lost. What bracelet? You lost a bracelet and you didn't tell me? No, I lost it when I was 10 at Santaland. My Grammy gave it to me and it had inscriptions on it that have a pathway to true beauty and real love. It's got sayings on it. "I am valuable. "Magnificent masterpiece." Maybe it really does have the answers. What answers? Santaland? You're not making sense. Are you okay? No, I'm not. I need to find that bracelet. I'm going to Georgia. Georgia? You realize this is crazy. Yes. You need to stay here and focus on your career in New York. Going anywhere else would be a mistake. I don't make mistakes. You won't believe this, but the airline lost my luggage. It's a complete disaster. Anyways, do you have any better luck for me? Santaland? Nope. I mean, I couldn't find anything online. It's like Santaland doesn't exist. Are you sure you didn't dream it? And if Josh, my pen pal didn't stop writing me, we would at least have his last name and then we could search for that. But my rideshare driver says he thinks he knows where it is. You're trusting a ride share driver to drive you in the country at night? Yeah. It's Georgia. It's fine. Isn't it? Yeah. I'll put my GPS on. Hey Josh, hand me a couple more red bows. We got it. Oh we're making some good progress. I just really hope that this year isn't the last year. 87 years is a good run. I am grateful for all the years we did have. Well I just don't understand, why can't we keep Santaland open? That's pretty simple Rowdy. We just aint makin' enough money to support the farm and Santaland. - Well it's not a done deal. - Yeah. Just gotta have a little faith. Yeah, well, I do. I do too. Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt. You look like a Christmas tree ornament. Who me? Actually, I'm looking for Santaland. Well, you found it. Hey, Rowdy's the name. But Santaland doesn't open 'til Saturday so uh, you're gonna have to wait. Is there something we can help you with? Maybe. I lost something a long time ago and I, this might sound really weird, but I wanted to look for it to see if I could find it? It's really important to me. Did you not understand me? I know who you are. You're that model. Jubilee Cosmetics. Belle Winters. Yes. And you are? You don't look like a model. You look regular. Well, I like regular. Regular's good. Nice to have you here, Ms. Winters. I hope you can find what you're looking for. Thank you. But it's dark. Do you have a place to stay? You know, I didn't even think about lodging or food or... Lucky for you, we have both. So you don't have to worry. Thanks. Follow me. Okay. How'd the cold miss you? It's snowing like crazy in New York. Yeah, it looks like it's going to be another short sleeve Christmas for us. So what did you lose? Are you sure it was here? Yeah, it was my bracelet, and yes, I am sure. Bracelet? How long ago? Wow, I remember this. I was about 10 or so. 25 years. Josh. Is that you? Yep. How could you do that? You knew it was me back there by the fire. Why didn't you tell me it was you? You didn't seem to know and, with as famous as you are, you've met thousands of people since and I didn't wanna embarrass myself in case you forgot me. Forgot you? - We were pen pals. - Until we weren't. Do you have any luggage? No, the airline lost it all. Well, I have guests. The light doesn't work inside, but you can use my flashlight. It's good to see you too, Belle. I'm so sorry I stopped writing, Belle.

No. All right, come on. What's that smell? I'm coming. Wait. Those boots are filthy. Wait here. My favorite boots. Joshua Carpenter! What are you doing? There we go, all clean. You did that on purpose. Well, it certainly wasn't an accident. I mean just because we live in a farm house, doesn't mean we want the farm inside the house. Okay, so you can clean up through there. You'll sleep in here and there's some clothes in the closet that should fit you. That's convenient. Convenient for you, maybe. Goodnight, Belle. Goodnight, Josh. It's good to see you again.

Well 25 years is a long time to catch up on, and last night didn't feel like the right time. How does my Poppy know you? Oh, we know each other from a long time ago. From Santaland. I love Santaland. I don't want it to go away. Well it's not going anywhere, honey. - Not if I have a say, okay? - Okay. So Adele, how old are you? Seven, almost eight, next month. Adele, why don't you go get changed? I'll clean up after you. Okay. You look like a robber to me, but I'm glad you're not. Does she have a mom? She did. Mandy. My wife. She passed away a few years back. I'm sorry. Yeah, it's been really hard on Adele not having a mother. You know, she said something about Santaland going away? That's the second time I heard that. What's going on? Well, what she means is that if we don't raise 75,000, this year will be the last year. Are people not coming? Well, fewer and fewer. I guess they're just looking for something more modern. And that's just something we don't offer. Did you really come back here after all this time to search for a bracelet? I have to. Why? I really don't know. Honestly, I, it just hit me after all these years that I really need its message. And I know I need to find it if I can. It does, did, have a good message. You remember that? Hard to forget. Excuse me, I have some things to tend to. Wow. She's pretty. We'll go get a tree. But first, don't you wanna get cleaned up so that you can be beautiful when we go shopping? But you said I'm always beautiful. And you are always beautiful. But, you've got so much mud on your face, I can barely see you. Hi. What? Nothing. We need to go change. Wait, what's the matter? You look like my mommy, except she has black hair. That's not at all what I'm trying to do. It's okay. They look good on you. So, do you wanna go Christmas tree shopping with us? Oh no. I don't want to impose on family time. Plus, I really need to find my- - You should come, it's lots of fun. The last thing we do is decorate the tree. Okay. Yay! Thanks. I really enjoy seeing her happy. This place is so busy. I can't believe how many people are out here, even in the rain. They're really doing some good business. Yeah, they are.

We didn't officially meet the other night. I'm Josh's friend, Kathie. Going to the annual Christmas tree farm? Yes. Apparently so. Adele invited me and Josh should be over- Oh! I'm so sorry. It's okay. I shouldn't sneak up on you like that. Uh, you all find a tree yet? Adele found one that she liked, I just have to pay for it. Excuse us. Okay. Are you lookin' for a tree too? Yes, for the front of the church, uh, barn. But don't tell Josh. It's a surprise. Wait, Josh? Why would a tree in front of a church be a surprise to Josh? Okay. Pastor Josh, but he really doesn't like it when we call him that. Pastor? Josh? Oh, he didn't tell you. No. He neglected to mention that. I'm sure he would've gotten around to it. Gran Poppy told me you two had a history. - Yeah, we were pen pals. - Oh. And then for whatever reason, he stopped writing and he didn't answer any more of my letters, but that was over 20 years ago.

Amen. - Amen. - Amen. Amen. Josh. I think it's time that I, I pass on this lighter to you. Really? Yeah.

I can't say I've been the best judge of character when it comes to men. Well our judge of character is often influenced by the way we see ourselves. Do you know why we light the Christmas candle? Uh uh. It symbolizes the light of our savior, welcoming his presence into our hearts, no matter what we look like. Look like? Well people are what's on the inside, not what's on the outside. Why would you say that? Oh sweetheart, because it's true. And I think you need to hear it and know it for yourself. I'm gonna go see if I can help them in the kitchen. Wow. That's really good.

She's going to help me make Christmas cookies, just like you used to. I hope you don't mind. Uh huh. We're gonna make Christmas cookies and they're gonna be sugar cookies and gingerbread cookies.

"Your beauty is not just how you look on the outside, "but by the things you do and who you are on the inside. "And above all these things, "you are beautiful because God made you special, "unique, one of a kind, that no one else can compare to. "You, Mabel, are..." Beautiful. The end. - Well, I guess- - Yeah big day tomorrow. I spent a lot of time praying. We need a miracle to save Santaland. Well miracles do happen. They sure do. You came back. Do you mean that? I never say anything I don't mean. I owe you big apology. You do? For what? The last box in the attic. I found all the pen pal letters you sent me that I never got. You did? But, that doesn't make any sense. Sure it does. My mother sent them back without letting me know about them. And I guess your mom didn't want you to get hurt. I can understand that. No, I don't. Why would my mom do that? Because she loved you. My mom loved me, too. She was just trying to protect me. She had ideas about beauty and love that I bought into. Life is nothing without love and forgiveness. Forgiveness truly lifts all of that weight. Is that the pastor in you speaking? That's the friend who cares deeply about you speaking. And a little pastor. Thank you. For so much. - Well, I think- - Yeah, well... Goodnight, Belle.

So glad to have everybody here. A big round of applause for John Schneider and Beckah Shae! Remember, give big. Give big. Thank you so much for coming out to save Santaland. Thank you, Belle Winters. Make sure you guys come back tonight, right here, in the barn, for the dance and thank you so much for coming. Oh, and come back tomorrow for our annual nativity pageant right here when we turn this thing into a cowboy church. Thank you guys so much. The band, you were amazing. Thank you guys. Oh. So, will you be my date to the dance? Like this? I think I need to clean up a little. No, like this is just fine. No, I really need to go change- - No. Clothes only. I'm beginning to like this new Belle a lot. Clothes only. I thought you might like it. I think like is a massive understatement. Shall we? Where's Adele? Oh, I gave her and Gran Poppy the evening together. Smart man. May I? I'd love to. Josh, this is amazing. No one had ever treated me like this before. No way. You? Everyone must love you. I am a meal ticket to most of them, or a way for them to advance their own careers. ♪ I've already tried to give up ♪ ♪ To run, but there's nowhere to hide ♪ You know, I thought that if I could be physically beautiful enough, everyone would love me. And? Well, my career's only as good as my looks, and that's not good enough anymore. That's why I came here, hoping that if I could find that bracelet, it would make me beautiful again. But you are beautiful in every way, inside and out. You don't need a bracelet for that. Maybe... Maybe the bracelet was needed elsewhere. Hey. - I want to show you something. - Okay. Come with me. I remember this. Hold on. Oh, it's so beautiful. Josh, it's snowing. This is the best night ever. I agree with that. So, what are your plans? What's next for you? Oh, I have to go back to Manhattan. Why? Well, it's where I live and where I work. Why? Are you asking me to stay? I'm asking to see where this goes. Well, I came here looking for something I haven't found yet. Well, maybe you found it and you just don't know it. It's probably all a dream anyways. All of this. Are you sure you want this? You have a family, a daughter, a church you're responsible for, Santaland. I mean, you have a lot on your plate. And I'm also a man. Alright, I'll come back. I promise. Oh. Hi, Cass. I just had the best night of my life. Yeah, I know. You're burning up the internet. What? How? Social media postings of all kinds of photos and comments of you saving Santaland. I couldn't believe what I saw. Up to your rear in mud, Christmas gifts on your head, dancing with the very good looking man getting celebrities there with no publicity for yourself. The media is all over it tonight. Oh, you're kidding. Someone opened a crowdfunding page for Santaland and it's going crazy. That is fantastic. It's amazing. Everyone loves you. No, I'm not doing this so people will love me. Okay. Oh and that guy I was dancing with? That was Josh. The pen pal? Yes. The pen pal. My mother sent back all the letters. The letters, oh, I haven't even read the letters. I'm gonna call you back. Bye. What's that? Aww. A note for his wife. "Mandy, I thought you can use the message here." Oh. "I pray for your healing every day. "I love. Josh." I don't believe this. Are you okay? No. You lied to me. - I thought- - I can explain. It wasn't personal. It's something I've been struggling with. Been praying about it. Everything except for being straight with the one person you needed to. You. Take this. I'm taking my bracelet and I am leaving tomorrow. You don't have to go. I can explain. Honest. The bracelet is what kept Mandy alive longer. I found it years ago. And when I never heard from you... Mandy got sick. I thought giving it to her would have been the right thing to do. I'm glad that it helped Mandy, I'm really glad. But you broke my trust in you. You knew it was there this entire time. All you had to do was give it to me. Then you would've left. Well I have it now and I am leaving. So it looks like you were right. Can't we just talk about this some more? It wasn't just about Mandy. It was for Adele, too. Oh, wow. You're bringing Adele into this? I love her, but bringing her into this, that's low, Josh. Leave me alone and don't talk to me until I go. Poppy, Belle's door is locked and she won't answer when I knock. Honey, you need to leave Belle alone right now. Is she not coming to church with us today? No. Not today. Come on, let's finish getting ready. Hi Cass. Yeah. Meet me at the entrance in an hour. I'll be there. Well, I hope you stay for the nativity service. After all, it is the reason for the season. I have a confession to make. I deliberately misled someone that I care about in order to protect the memory of another who's gone. Not forgotten. But gone. "I am generous. "Joyful giver. "True beauty is serving others. "Make yourself attractive by doing acts of love. "Use whatever gift you've received to serve others." To read it, to take its words to your heart that true beauty is here. Hi, this is Belle winters again. Can I uncancel my cancellation for the deal? I know, I was rash and wrong to cancel it. Forgive me, but I, I still wanna buy it, if that's okay. Thank you. That's good. I'll meet you there as planned. Okay, bye. Josh, if it's you, please just let me be. It's Adele. Belle, please, I need you. Aren't you just so adorable? If your father sent you... We don't have a donkey for the nativity. Could you do it please? - Um... - We had a no show. If you don't wanna do it, it's okay. I just wanted it to be you. You're a real model. You don't waste much time, do you? I just read some good advice, to use whatever gift you have to serve others. My mommy used to say that, from her bracelet. Let me get changed. Yeah. God sent the Angel Gabriel, to tell a Virgin, Mary- - That's our cue. - "You're highly favored, "and you'll give birth to a son, "and you will call him Jesus." Mary, betrothed to Joseph, and with child, went to his hometown of Bethlehem, but there was no room at the inn. So they found space in a nearby manger. Beautiful isn't she? Oh, absolutely. I just wish Belle was here to see it. See it? She's up there. What? Gifts of gold and frankincense. - The donkey. - Mhm. - No way. - She volunteered. On that night, that silent night. ♪ Silent night ♪ Holy night ♪ All is calm ♪ All is bright ♪ Round young virgin mother and child ♪ ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace Yeehaw! You're Josh, right? Yeah. Hi. Can this wait? I need to go see someone. I've got some papers for you to sign, to make it legal. She said it had to be done right away. She? Who? Uh, the lady. Belle. Belle Winters. What's this about? Belle, Belle, Belle. Why do you have to leave? Honey, my time here is done. I'm gonna miss you, but I have to go. No, you have to stay. Honey, if it was remotely possible, I would. She bought the Christmas tree farm? And put it in your name so that the income from it could be used to save Santaland. I'm speechless. I want you to remember me. I'm gonna go get Poppy. He'll stop you. Adele, no. I'm speechless. I can't believe this. Thank you. - Thank you so much. - Don't thank me. - It's a great deal. - Poppy, Poppy, Poppy. Belle's leaving. You have to get her back. All right, well let's go get her back. ♪ I've had it, I'm out of this town ♪ Thank you for coming, Cassidy. - I know you didn't have to. - What? And miss being with the hottest celebrity on the planet? I don't want to be the hottest celebrity. I just wanna go home. ♪ I'm never, ever, ever comin' back ♪ Oh, please, no autographs. This is her private space. I brought you some reading material for your flight home. I like you, Belle. Josh likes you a lot more. I think deep down, you like him. Read that. Maybe it'll open your eyes to what he was going through. It doesn't excuse what he did by any means, but it'd shed some much needed light as to why. And I mean this: it was a genuine pleasure getting to know the real you. ♪ I can't wait to leave you in the dust ♪ Okay, we're ready to go now. ♪ The makeup, the Botox, the runways ♪ She's gone. I'll pack your bag. If you want her, you need to tell her. I don't want her. Do you want her, Poppy? I do, sweetheart. I do. ♪ Ever comin' back ♪ 'Cause I'm never, ever, ever comin' back ♪ I'm worried about you. You didn't want any publicity? Thank goodness for social media. I did what I did because it was the right thing to do. Privately. I'm kind of sorry that it even got out. I have a good therapist. You better think carefully before you say anything else. Okay, now I'm really worried. Are you okay? I've never been better in my life, and no, I'm not, okay. - That makes zero sense. - Does to me. "Today was a good day. "Josh is so loving and supportive. "I know his heart is breaking and Adele "doesn't seem to understand that I'll be gone soon. "I just pray she'll be okay. "The charm bracelet Josh gave me "has helped me more than I can ever say. "The words on the charm are like a roadmap to true beauty. "When she's old enough, I want Adele to have it "and understand its meaning. "If I can leave her that, I've done my job as a mother." I made a mistake. What? You? You made a mistake? No, I didn't make a mistake. Okay, that's the Belle I know. I made a huge mistake. Turn this thing around. Please take me back to Santaland. Shh. They're in Josh's room right now packing these bags to go and find you. Come on. It's all you, buddy. We're looking for socks. He doesn't have enough socks. Hurry, get your daddy. I think I heard a robber in your mama's room. A robber? You bet Mandy. I'll make sure Adele gets the bracelet. Belle? Yes, Josh is wonderful. Sometimes he's not so smart, though. Belle. Shh. Can't you see I'm on the phone? I promise I'll take very good care of both of them. Bye, Mandy. You gonna help me out of here or what? Come on. I owe Aunt Kathie a huge thank you. Oh yes. I did a lot of dumb things. Oh yes. But Mandy made me understand them. You also did a lot of good things, too. I meant everything I said last time we were here. So did I.
