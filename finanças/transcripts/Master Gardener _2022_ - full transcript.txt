The formal garden imposes geometric strictures on plants. Circles, squares, triangles. These are also known as French gardens. Informal gardens, also known as British gardens, were popularized in the 18th century and adhere to the shapes and contours of nature. A third type, the wild garden, only appears to be wild. It contains a seemingly random variety of plants and shrubs which supports insects and wildlife. Gardening is a belief in the future. A belief that things will happen according to plan. That change will come in its due time. Okay. We have officially begun the timeline for this year's Spring Charity Auction. Charles Grow and Company have begun the event logistics. No doubt you've been following the design schema. I don't envisage there's going to be any changes, so we're locked and loaded. Xavier and I are going through the assignments and after this, Maggie and Xavier will head over to the main greenhouse. Last year's Charity Auction, uh, collected 150,000 for Meals on Wheels. This year, I would like to exceed that. Not just for the community, but for... Ms. Haverhill herself. When you're ready. The angel wings have recovered. Mm, that was quite a scorching. I don't know what I was thinking. You can't spreadsheet nature. It'll only surprise you. They'll recover in the gate garden. Mm, more beautiful than ever. For the visitors, they'll be "a moment." Mr. Roth? We got a message from the Gracewood house. Ms. Haverhill would like you to drop by. - When? - Whenever you have a chance. Nothing urgent. Well, we all know what that means. - Janine. - Narvel. Take a seat on the porch. Ms. Norma will be out in a moment. Hello, hello. Narv. Sweet Pea. - Shall I go and change? - No, porch is just fine. I love the early morning rain. It's very, uh... What's the word? Nitrogen oxide. Soulful. Yes, that's it. Move over. You know I named him Porch Dog when he was just a pup. I knew that was all he'd ever be good for. Now, how's the event coming? Oh, very good. I'll walk you through the garden preparations. Thanks, Ronnie. Last year's show had a wonderful reception. - Hmm. - This year, we're going to ramp up the auction a bit. A dozen variegated monstera cuttings, our crème de la crème Princess Irene bulbs, and this year, thanks to Yong Nursery, - a slipper orchid. - Hmm. It's always fun to watch grown men in pastel pants outbid each other over a flower. But that's not the reason why you asked me to join you. What is it, Norma? - I have a favor to ask. - What is it? My sister Betty's daughter had a daughter. That makes her my grandniece. Well, my sister's been long gone and last year, her daughter died. And it's been hard on my grandniece, so I hear. She's mixed blood. When she was a child, she would come to Gracewood with her mother. One summer, they came every week. And Maya, that's her name, was enchanted. Enchanting... just to see her play in the gardens. Here's a picture. When her parents broke up... He was a bum... ...they moved away. You know, how she ended up with him. No accounting for people's taste. It was okay with me, of course. And then she got cancer. Like my sister before her. Tit cancer. Well, Maya's life apparently hasn't turned out so well. She got in a funk, dropped out of school, and then lifestyle choices, I believe they call them. A bad crowd. It was only a matter of time. I felt I should do something. I would like you to take Maya on as an apprentice. I will provide transportation and minimum wage with adjustments. You will teach her how to tend a garden as well as classes in horticulture and so forth. What age is she? I'm not sure. Twenty? No, more. How long has it been since you've seen her? I haven't. That's your job. She's family. Gracewood is family. And you would like me to respond how? I was hoping you'd say, "Norma, it would be a pleasure to be of assistance to your grandniece." Norma, it would be a pleasure to be of assistance to your grandniece. Good. Now, let's see about that garden. Hmm. Come on, boy. Come on. There's a few variations this year, some practical, some seasonal. You know what they say, Narv? Money is the best manure. - Hmm. - The better the money, the better the manure. She went on to explain that aesthetic gardens were a recent development. In colonial times, gardens were utilitarian. A cross between a grocery store and a pharmacy. In the Gilded Age, they became an entrance to high society, a place of conspicuous display. At Gracewood, we have the best of both worlds. Four generations of curated botany, horticulture, and display. Now... where were we, Sweet Pea? You were wondering which color dress would be best. You wore the emerald green last year. With white frill on the sleeves and neck. That's right. I looked pretty good. Yes, you did. Porch Dog, come. You silly. The soft yellow autumn minaret daylilies begin their long season first, the second week of July. A week later, a profusion of sunset cosmos follows. Their sulfur petals overshadow the daylilies. Then, just before high summer, the color wheel comes alive. Toward the end of the month, overnight, the purple and pink perennial asters burst into bloom and for 38 hours they are all glowing. We're gardeners. We pull out the weeds. Hello. - I'm Narvel Roth. - Narvel? What kind of name is that? What kind of name is Maya? Well, that is my name. Where's Norma? Ms. Haverhill thought she'd give you a little time to get settled in. When was the last time you saw her? Oh, have a seat. Uh... I don't know. Years. She said that you used to come here with your mother. - Do you remember that? - Of course. It looks the same. Mostly. Ex... except for that. - Magenta garden. - Mm-hmm. What did Ms. Haverhill say to you? - When she called? - Uh... I can't remember. Um... Yeah, she said she had a job. Like an apprenticeship. Do I get paid? Well, you started getting paid the moment you stepped out of the car. Minimum wage. It goes up every month. Car service included. You provide your own lunch. And I pull the weeds? Well, that's part of it. It's also an education. You'll learn how to garden and you'll also have classes in the history of gardens and horticulture, botany. - Seriously? - Seriously. And I'll be your teacher. One hour a day. There'll be assignments and quizzes. Does that interest you? Uh... Do you hope to someday work in a garden? Good. Well, let's get you changed, and... I'll introduce you to some of the folk that work here. Okay. There's the grand house. This is the main potting shed. Part of it is being converted into a common room. Uh, spare overalls and gloves. Oh, do you have a pair of boots? - Uh, these. - We'll see what we can find. Isobel, this is Maya. I told you about her, she'll be training with us. - Maya, Isobel. - Hi. Waters and soda in the cooler. Uh, Browns Bakery delivers sandwiches. Put money in the honor jar and... Oh, if you want anything special they can make it for you. Oh, here's Xavier for his sugar hit. Xavier, this is Maya. Welcome aboard. Uh... this is Maggie. Oh, at the end of the day if you need to clean up, there's a washroom. This is a tool rack. Oh, we have a few cultural differences that may take you a little while to get used to. For example, this is a riddle. Oh, this is a hoe and there are in fact 38 different kinds of hoes. And how many kinds of riddles? Well, that is what we're about to find out. Why don't you get changed and... I'll see you in a bit. Now, all of these plants here are raised on an organic mix of elements like perlite, coconut coir, sphagnum moss. But when combined with soil it creates loam, and loam is the best kind of growing soil. Now, I have a sample. Uh, take your gloves off. And I want you to pick it up. Grab a handful and squeeze it. And smell it. And really smell it, come on. Kiss it. Really smell it. Oh! And what do you smell? Animal? Mineral? Vegetable? Hmm. All three. Now, 70 years ago the soil in this area was depleted by industrial farming and in order to fix it, they added fertilizer. And guess what? It made it worse. Come on, smell it again. Get in there. Come on, don't be afraid. That's a filthy habit, Mr. Roth. I allow myself one per day. - See you tomorrow. - Yep. What is it? She's doing okay, isn't she? Seems to be. Young people, who knows? Has Norma met her? Why not? Doesn't that seem strange? It's her land. Her garden. Her grandniece. You know, people used to walk on the soil. Now they just walk on tar and concrete... wearing rubber soles. They used to sleep on the land... and there was an exchange... and that was a healing process. You amaze me when you get romantic like this. The nandina is a species of flowering plant native to Eastern Asia. The smell at certain times of the year is minty, with a hint of almond. It gives you a real buzz. Like the buzz you get just before pulling the trigger. Gardening is the most accessible of the arts. It's already there. Every seed is a plant, waiting to be unlocked. It was commonly thought that 150 years was the lifetime of a seed. In the 1950s, a Japanese botanist discovered viable lotus seeds in an Ice Age lakebed. A substantial portion were germinated. It is now believed that the lifetime of a seed is between 850 and 1,250 years. Given the right conditions, seeds can last indefinitely. I wear mine on my skin every day. All right, special announcement. Listen up, I would like to raise a cup... to Maya. - Maya! - Two weeks in our... ...special little community. To Maya. I hope we haven't made - life too hard on you. - Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Ow! Then she gave me a book. It was about gardens. "What am I supposed to do with this?" I said. "Read it," she said. - Thank you, Janine. - Narvel. Thank you. Would you like a water or tea? - I'll tell Ronnie. - Oh, I'm not... How about a Manhattan? Ronnie makes one where he gets a syringe and shoots a little cherry Cointreau into the maraschino. The Missus loves it. Oh, that sounds like just the ticket. Mr. Roth. Ronnie. You clean up real nice, Sweet Pea. I've always said that. Thank you. Ronnie uses a syringe to shoot the maraschinos with Cointreau. It's delicious. Janine said that. So, how is she doing? Uh, who? Who do you think? It took you long enough to ask. So, how is she doing? Quite well. I think she's surprised that you haven't come to visit her yet. Sometimes you have to wait them out. Well, perhaps you could reconsider. How much research did you do before you took her on? Huh. As I thought. I didn't do much on you, either. Hmm. She's an apprentice. You were an apprentice once. Is she smart? Yes. More than I could say about her mother. Dinner is ready. I had something on my mind when I invited you. I imagined. That was delicious. This year's Charity Auction. - I want it to be special. - It will be. It may be the last. I'm having some... health issues. Oh, I'm... I'm sorry. No, no, it's not like that, but... the effort it takes, it's... Perhaps next year, I might not be up to it. Well, you're strong. And if I'm not? Well, Norma, then it will be the darndest Charity Gala you've ever thrown. I've made some preparations. - Yeah? - Sweet Pea... are you listening? I don't want to repeat myself. I get... forgetful. That is not true. I'm listening, go ahead. Some preparations with the estate managers and legal team. The main house and some ancillary properties will be sold off. The Trust will ensure the gardens in perpetuity and you will have a yearly income and control of the gardens. And when the time comes, you will designate your successor. I leave this thing I have inherited and maintained, I leave it in your hands. I'm honored, but I think that I will beat you out the door. It would be nice if the gardens remained in the family. Do you think she's up to it? That is a question only you can ask. I think that you should meet with her. - Set that up. - Hmm. Now... take me to bed. You first. Let me see it. Fire! What happened to Johnny Boy? Was like a son to me. He's been talking to the Feds. Trust me on this one. I want you to handle it. Uh-huh. Now we're just looking for a good spot... - Mm-hmm. - ...with the shovel. - Can I get a pansy? - Yeah. Here you go. And you just mix it with the new soil... and... Nice. That's easy enough. - Oh, here comes Ms. Haverhill. - Okay. Maya. - I'm Norma Haverhill. - Hi. I like your outfit. I was wondering if you needed any help. We were, um... It's under control. Well, it's lunchtime. Perhaps we could get a snack. I don't have anything prepared. We'll use the lunch room. Narvel mentioned that you had expected me to come by. That's on me. I apologize. I'm an old woman and sometimes I forget what's proper. Did you order this? No. It is less than suitable. Hmm... We could go to the main house and Ronnie could whip us up a... Oh, no, it's okay, thank you. I'm a very simple person. There's a lot to be said for that. In the greenhouses, we're working with Cleome Senorita Rosalitas. - Already? - Mm-hmm. Such a beautiful flower. And when the white sheds to purple... It needs to be deadheaded. It channels the energy to the flowers instead of the seeds. Do you remember me? Yeah, of course. And your mother? Um, yeah. Yes. Did she talk about me? Yeah. Do you wanna hear this? - Sorry? - Do you wanna hear this? Um... I got dressed for garden work, walked over here, I invited you to lunch, I trusted you to Narvel. Of course I want to hear what you have to say. There's nothing I want to hear more. Hmm. Well, she was conflicted. She felt that you thought she was... um... inadequate. She thought that? Yes. You need to remember she wasn't my child. She was my sister's child. But her name was Norma. Her mother named her after you. Betty, my sister, didn't ask my permission to do that. I thought it was... presumptuous. Or maybe she wanted to obligate you. I believe that was her point. Because she was inadequate. I'm not sure I like that tone. I gave your mother everything I could. My sister couldn't give her enough. Whatever it was, it wasn't enough. She couldn't weed her garden. And how could you have known that? There are things you know in your flesh, your nostrils, your eyes... Listen to me. I came here for a pleasant lunch and here we are in the muck of the past. It is a muck farm. And I'm sorry if I offended you. But I'm not inadequate. No, of course you're not. You are impertinent. And don't think for a second about leaving Gracewood Gardens. Overnight, black aphids appeared growing on the tips of the Dropmore scarlet. It was all hands on board to spray a mix of neem oil, karanja oil, and pure soap to stop the outbreak in its tracks. I've never thought too much about women, other than as women. I'm not sure what it is about these two women, Norma and her grandniece. I'm not sure I want to know. Binomial nomenclature. Each country, culture, has thousands of plants. And all those plants have multiple names in multiple languages. How were horticulturists supposed to agree on the name for a tree or a flower? Uh, 1700s, Carl Linné had an idea. Why not use a dead language, Latin, that everybody could agree upon? As a result, he changed his name to Carl... Linnaeus. Now binomial is two words, just like human names. So, Rosa rubiginosa, that's a rose. Uh, sweet briar rose. Take me, for example. Roth is my genus, or category, and Narvel is my specific name. Now Roth means red, or Rothum. So, if I were a Rothum, people might say, "Well, which of the reds is he?" And somebody might say, "Well, he's the one who stinks," and then I would be... Rothum foetidum or Stinking Red. So, if you heard Rothum foetidum you would know that people were talking about me. That is, if people were thinking about me. And what makes you so sure people aren't thinking about you? I heard that Norma stopped by for lunch. Word travels fast. That kind of word does. Uh, what did she say? She gave me a raise. She walked out on you. And she gave me a raise. You walk a line, Maya. I walk a line. Norma walks a line. And you walk a line. Be careful. Hmm. Mr. Roth? - What's up? - Maya's injured. She said not to tell you, but I think you should come. Yeah. H... hold on. I'm... I'm sorry, I shouldn't have come. No, nonsense. Should I call 911? Janine, I leave that up to you. Yeah, I'm not sure. If she does go, she'll have a drug test. We could take care of her here. Maya. We're going to clean you up here, fix you up. Get you some rest and see how you feel in a few hours. I'm really sorry. I shouldn't have come. Hey, we're your family now. You did the right thing to come. You're safe, all right? You're safe here. Well, frankly, I think Norma's a little tickled by it. Not much happens at Gracewood Gardens. Well, it's a little too much drama for me. How are you feeling? Good. Better, really. Come tomorrow morning, it's going to hurt. Well, I'm ready to get back to work. Want to give us a minute? Xavier, I need some help with the replanting. Maya, I'm not a man to pry into other people's lives. I'm certainly not a man to want people to pry into mine. The situation here is a little different. We take pride in our young staff at Gracewood. When they succeed, we feel good. And when they get drunk or post a sexist meme, well, that hurts us. But when they get beat up... that really bothers us. So, you wanna get rid of me? Absolutely not. No, we want to be of help. Are you satisfied with the life that you have? Who did this to you? Your boyfriend? He's not my boyfriend. RG. - Oh, he tells you what to do? - Oh, he's a dealer. RG what? He was my mom's dealer. After she died, I ran errands for him. He liked the fact that I could pass in fancy hotels. And what happened? He didn't like my attitude. He'd been up all night, didn't like the way that I smelled. He said he knew where I was going and he'd beat me if I came back. And then what happened? He did. I think it best if you stay at Gracewood tonight. I'm going to talk to Isobel. Yeah. Gomez. Robbie Gomez. All right. Wait here. I'll, uh, go check on it. Ms. H? Maya was injured. I noticed. I get reports. She's okay now, but I think it best if she stayed at Gracewood tonight. Why doesn't she ask? Because I'm asking. Did you hear about the way she talked to me? I'm asking. She'll figure it out. We all have to make our own way. You figured it out. You were patient with me. Sweet Pea. I have to catch up on things tonight. Next week, then. This is really sweet. Thanks, Janine. I have created this life. Filled it with rules. Now seems the time to break one. Deputy Marshal Neruda? Narvel Roth. - Were we meeting in... - Three months. Hey, what's going on? Well, something's come up and... I wanted to meet in person, if possible. The same place? Tots is still standing. They put a Starbucks down the block, but yeah. Yeah. Uh, 9:00 a.m.? That works. - Early as usual. - Force of habit. Sit. It's good to see you. Want anything? - Uh... - Over here. Uh, coffee. Yeah, and I'll have a toasted bran muffin with butter. Same. So, how's my old crowd? Dead, mostly. Yeah, prison will do that to a person. Old Man finally croaked last year. A couple still hanging by their diapers. Potty Patlo's got dementia. Johnny Boy. Fucking Jeremiah. Reverend Charles. Reverend Charles Avery. Oh, that nigger has it out for me. He needs to vanish. Don't leave any witnesses. Wait, wait, wait. Yeah, I remember. Thought you would. So much for... memory lane. Lot of hits. Fourteen indictments. Two years in court. You flipped. You broke up the band. So, am I in the clear? That's never going to happen. You're a known guy. You put the deep six on nine bad guys. I mean, even if they're dead, you're not forgotten. Every skinhead punk wants to make a name for himself, move up, just gotta say, "I found Norton Rupplea, and I took him out." Instant cred. No, my friend. You're never going to be Norton Rupplea again. My driver's license expires in a few months. I'll take care of it. Uh, you got something on your mind? It concerns where I work. You've done a terrific job. Actually, I'm impressed. You know, I wish for both of our sakes we can go public. You're a WITSEC poster boy. If I had a little gold star, I'd put it on your fucking forehead right now. There's a young woman. Works as an apprentice at the gardens. And the owner feels an obligation to her. She took a beating. She was involved in drugs, maybe a mule. So, where do I come in? - Uh, she has a boyfriend. - Hmm. Robbie Gomez, birthname. Piece of shit. His crew work out of the 9th Street Projects. I was wondering if you could pull up his name on that databank of yours and see. There's gotta... gotta be a rap sheet. All right. Oh, yeah. Here we go. - Oh, he's been busy. - Hmm. So, what's going on? I would like someone, not me of course, uh, it's too risky, but someone from law enforcement to pay RG a knock and talk. Tell him they heard stories about the way he treats women, one case in particular. Tell him they got their eye on him and if they hear any more such stories, he's going to be the first person they visit. And obviously they've got more reasons to visit him. You asking me a favor? I guess so, yeah. Well, I think you've earned it. I'll take care of it. Great, thank you. All right. So what, you're retiring? When are you retiring? Hundred and two days. You'll be assigned a new case agent. Hmm. All right, maybe we could meet up after that. No, Narvel. That's just not possible. Yeah. All right. Good morning. Hmm, very good. Coming along nicely. Hey. - How's it going? - Good. You all right? Oh. Uh... Norma has invited you to lunch at the house, tomorrow. Uh, I thought she didn't like me. Oh, she has her own things going on. Hmm. And what will I wear? Uh, that is a question for Isobel. I'm looking into this situation with RG. I left a message with someone. - Who? - Someone I know. Someone you know? Someone I used to know. She talked about her life. There's something missing in her. Something vital fell out and something took its place. Maya, do you take drugs? - Why would you ask that? - It's a simple question. Yeah. So what? Often? No, I don't have a drug problem. But somebody does. When did you shoot up? - You're reaching now. - You started it. Let's go back. It's so simple when it begins. You don't ask why. You forget how it started. One day leads to the next. The seeds of love grow, like the seeds of hate. Maya? Come in. - Hey. - Hey. Everything all right? Yeah, good. Uh... So, I spoke to a couple of people, and... it should be safe for you to go back to your place in a couple of days. Uh, and... this is for you to wear to lunch tomorrow. - You all right? - Uh, yeah. Sorry. Isobel got me this? Uh, Norma wanted to pick something out for you. Oh. Um... Thank you. Thank Norma. Hey, hey. Sorry. Uh, no, no. Sorry. Uh, don't do that. It looks good. - Charles did a good job. - He always does. - Has he sent it out? - Waiting on your approval. He has it. You're looking stunning in that dress. Did I say that? Uh, yes. Thank you. Good enough to be on television. You know, I was on television. Did you know that? Well, you're too young to remember, but Westerns were all the craze. The Rifleman. It was a father and son show, was on the same time every week. Tuesday, nine o'clock. And, um... Oh, God, Johnny Crawford was the cutest boy I'd ever seen. He was once a Mouseketeer. I bet you don't know what that is. Oh... Father had taken me to Los Angeles on business. He knew the people who did the show and they needed a little girl to give Johnny a flower. Do you know who that little girl was? - You. - Right. They filmed it three times. Father had all his friends come to the house to see the show when it aired. Right here. Oh, I'm sure you can see it somewhere. Probably on the internet. I hate the internet. Yeah, you hardly use it. Before cell phone cameras, if you did something, it was your word against theirs. Now if you do something, your friends just record it and put it on the internet. Oh, I bet there's some juicy pictures of you on the web. Norma, stop that. - Stop what? - You know what. I hear things. What? What things? Is that you talking, or your dick? You don't think I see? You think you can run around the backyard in the middle of the night pulling your pants up, after paying a little visit to this one here? Ah. Well, guess it runs in the blood. Just like her mother. Norma, you asked me to look out for her. Yeah, but I didn't think you were going to be Humbert Humbert in your own production of Lolita. Maya's just finding her own way. And I'm the fucking Queen of Scotland! - You should apologize. - To the slut? - Janine! Ronnie! - You, too. - For what? - I want you gone. I warned you. I don't want you around here anymore. Just calm down. Tonight. I want you out tonight. We'll talk tomorrow. Mr. Oscar Neruda. That's who I'll talk to. I remember when he asked me to help. He said you were a special case. As you wish. Norma, I want to thank you. For what? For having faith in me. I thought you had a green thumb. I didn't know it was a green middle finger. This was the time. The time I had been waiting for. Just give me a second. It's Narvel, Maya. Yeah, okay. Come in. She, uh, wants you to leave. In fact, she wants us both to leave. Now. Is she serious? Oh, yeah, I think so. - Can she even do that? - It's her estate. The gardens belong to her. So, we're leaving. So, do I have to go back? Uh, well... Uh... You're welcome to stick with me. If you trust me. Can you do that? I have to grab a few things from my place. Yeah. Fuck! That's him, that's RG. - Where? - Just... The one in the red. The other one's Sissy. I'm just here on the left, just one block. Wait, I'll come with you. No, it's okay, I'm good. I'll wait. Yeah? - Yeah, who's this? - Where are you? Hold your fucking horses! I'm coming. Hey. I'm looking for someone. Are you the one they call Frito the Beaner? - That what they say? - Now, what the fuck? Oh, must have got the wrong information. You I know. You're the one they call RG. You're the one that got some good advice the other day. Yeah. And you must be Farmer John. I'm a gardener. That's why I wear these funny clothes and carry these pruning shears as part of my job. You know, pruning shears, they can snap off a branch or a plant bulb just like that. Same time it takes to snap off a finger or some testicles. Hey, Sissy, think twice before you move. I've done a lot of pruning in my life. RG? You got a visit from the police. I'm the second warning. Hey, chill, Proud Boy! How are you feeling? Good. Pretty high, huh? All right, whatever it is, take it out and put it on the ground. Check your socks, your waistband, and your duffel. What, you want me to do it? Huh? Fucking Christ! The lavender sage and plum poppies bloom the same time every year but never quite the same way. Some years they are in giddy harmony, other years they barely tolerate each other. Let me tell you how this is going to work, Maya. Fuck you. You're feeling bad now, but your system will adjust. Piece of shit. I would like you to go to the bathroom now and shower and change. It's... it's very important that you stay hydrated. Narcotics Anonymous is a fellowship of men and women who are learning to live without drugs. We are a nonprofit society and have no dues or fees of any kind. I'm Narvel, I'm a drug addict. - Welcome, Narvel. - Thank you. I'm Maya, I'm a drug addict. Welcome, Maya. I found a life in flowers. How unlikely is that? I'm not leaving until I say goodbye to my daughter. Now where are they? She doesn't want to talk to you. She's had time to think about your beliefs. She doesn't share them. Yeah, all right. What about Annie? You know, she's five years old. Your wife told her that you were killed in an accident. Hey. I... I did everything that you asked me to do. And now you've testified, you'll be relocated. Time to start a new life, pal. How are you feeling? I'm shaky. But pretty good. You know I wasn't really a drug addict, right? Oh, no, no, I didn't think you were. But if you know any and they come along, there's a barf bag in the back. 'Cause... Yeah. Go on and smirk, Mr. Smirk. But if I needed a barf bag, I would have brought my own, and that's not the case. So, thank you but no thank you. My daughter's 13 now. You know, if... if at any point that she wanted to see me, - reach out, can she do that? - Doesn't work that way. And if you attempt to go around the Marshals Service and... contact her directly, you'll only endanger her. Where are they? I don't know. I don't want to know. Have you ever been to Great Dixter? - Great Dixter? - Yeah, I've been reading. Dixter is... is a long way from here. London. England. Whatever. Someday, maybe. You could take me. I thought you already had one today. Well... you get a second if you go to a meeting. - That's the 13th step. - Right. You know you talk a lot of shit, but... there's one thing you don't talk about. What's that? Yourself. Well, there's not much to know. Were you ever married? I was, a long time ago. What happened? Didn't work. Any kids? I had a girl. She died, and that was the end of the marriage. Your pops? - Yeah, he's dead, too. - Hmm. How? - Drugs. - Huh. What was his name? - Maladi. - Maladi. It's an African name. When did he come here? - About 200 years ago. - Uh-huh. Say there's about 300 botanical gardens in the United States. And most of them are pretty good, some are great. But they all owe a debt to this guy, John Bartram. His garden in 1728, in Philadelphia, it was the model for gardens that came after. And this guy was generous to a fault. I mean, so he collected seeds from all over the Northeast and he'd send them to botanists all over the world. They call them "Bartram's boxes." The Japanese garden's that way... and the tropical pavilion's this way. I saw your tattoos last night. Did you want me to? That must have taken a long time. It did, yeah. Do you have anything to say about it? Not at the moment. You should have them removed. I looked into it and I decided not to. Well, that's really fucked. This way. Are you going to say anything? I saw what I saw, right? Mm-hmm. So, can you imagine what I'm feeling right now? How much of a mind fuck all of this is? No, of course you can't. I thought you should know I was once someone else. I was raised to hate people that were different than me. And I did. And I was good at it. And what did you do to the people you hated? Did you... beat them? Kill them? What? I hate Robbie and Sissy. Are you going to kill them for me? - I hate... - No, don't fucking talk to me about hate. I have enough hate for the both of us. - Sorry... - Don't touch me! So, who are you right now? I'm just a gardener... who used to be someone else. But now I'm your friend. No, I cannot even be in the same room as you. No, stop! Fuck! I drove her to the motel. Got two rooms. She did not say a word. This journal was so helpful to me when I was under house arrest and for many years after. Now, I just find it a burden. - Deputy Marshal Neruda? - Yes. - Narvel Roth. - Hey. We need to meet again. Tomorrow? Saturday? Uh, things have been a bit hectic around here, but everybody's got the day off tomorrow, so that works for me. All right, 3:00 p.m. See you there. Narvel? It's Maya. Can you open the door? I'd like to come in. Is that okay? Yeah, okay. Anything to drink? Well, I... I got a soda from the machine. That's okay. I really want to take off my clothes. Is that okay? I want to take off my clothes so bad. I would like nothing more. Take your clothes off. Take off your shirt. Turn around. And you'll have them removed? Yes. Continue. Narvel? Whoo! Yeah! Whoo! Yeah! Uh... Yeah, excuse me? Sit down, Mr. Roth. - Can I get you something? - No. Where's Oscar? Deputy Marshal Neruda is less than three months from retirement. He felt this would be a good occasion to introduce his replacement. I'm Stephen Collins, though folks call me Stick. Nice to meet you. Oscar has briefed me. Your confidentiality has been in no way breached. Thank you. I'm aware of your exemplary record over the last decade. Hey, congratulations. Oscar and I met several weeks ago, here and... we made an agreement. And I just wanted an update before I go back. And what sort of agreement was that? It was about a drug crew working in the 9th Street Projects. Oh, he... he never said anything about that. Uh... Do you think we can get him on the phone? I'm your handler now. Deputy Marshal Neruda has handed over your case. Just like that? - Yeah, that's how it works. - Yeah. What was the problem on the 9th Street Projects? - It was about a drug crew. - W... what type of drug crew? Nice to meet you, Stick. And I'm sure you're pretty good at your job, but I just don't think that you can help me in this situation. Hey, try me. I just did. - Here. - Thanks. Yeah? Yeah. Was anybody hurt? Did you call the police? Where... Where are you now? Is Norma okay? All right, I'm on my way. Huh? Yeah, yeah. Go, go. There was an incident at Gracewood Gardens. - What? - Vandalism. Nobody was hurt. It's Robbie. It's an hour-and-a-half. Grab your stuff. The police left. What did you tell them? I didn't really see anything. Where's Norma? In the sitting room. Janine's with her. Look who's back. The bad penny. - How are you? - All right. No one came in. Porch Dog got kicked. Oh. I had this. Father's trophy Luger. - Let me take that. - They might come back. They were in your cabin. Uh, are the police coming back? We don't know. Well, I'd rather not be here if they do. Janine, look after her. I can call them and find out where they are. What are you going to do? You wait here, I'm gonna tie up some loose ends. No, these aren't your loose ends. They are now. Well, you can't find them without me. I'm coming with you. You'll do as I say? Yeah. All right. We wait until dark. All right, they just left. They're headed there now. It's the house, I've been there before. What goes on? It's just a party house. Video games, music, dope, fucking. It's just a regular house, so people can dip out the back. Well, all the better. What'd he say? "Come over any time. All is forgiven." Once we're inside, you step back. I'll take it from there. Okay? Craig! Yo, Maya, wassup, wassup, wassup, wassup? - What's going on? - How are you? - I've been good. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I hit up RG. He told us to come through so... Oh. Wait, wait, wait. Everybody out! No, nope, not you two. Get up, get over by the wall. Turn around, sit down. Down, down, down, down, get down. Maya? Come here. You wanted them dead, now here they are. All right, come here. Now you're gonna shoot them right in the head. Maya, please, we didn't mean any harm. You decide. Who do you want to shoot first? You can take whatever you want. We know we messed up. Concentrate. It's your move. Maya, please. Stretch your legs out. - You'll never see us. - Hey. - You'll never see us... - Stretch 'em out! Come on, out, out. Stretch 'em out! I need you to remember. How's it going? They should be done by today. Ronnie made some tea. How's Porch Dog? He's gonna be all right. I thought I'd have to pay the vet a fortune, but he just... up and recovered on his own. - Hmm. - Some men are like that. I have three matters to discuss with you. Firstly... there is your father's Luger. It's an heirloom. You should have it. Secondly, I'd like to discuss the restoration of Gracewood Gardens. And the damage seems irreparable now, but... plants rejuvenate, that's what they do. Like us. Give yourself another year and help me or... help us and next year's Spring Gala will be an achievement for Gracewood. And your other point? That's the us part. Maya and I will be living together in the cabin as husband and wife. That is... obscene. No, it's not. I've seen obscene. Have you lost your goddamn mind? Go ahead, pull the trigger. Go ahead, I deserve it. And there is a justice in it. But I have to warn you. The gun is not working, and it's not loaded. Goddamn you, Sweet Pea. Let's talk tomorrow. I should go. A garden job well done is a visual pleasure. Where there was an unsightly tangle, there is a display of what should be there instead of what should not be. Gardening is the manipulation of the natural world. A creation of order, where order is appropriate. The subtle adjustments of disorder where that would be effective.
