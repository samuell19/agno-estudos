Honey, I put your meds in here. Will the sunblock fit in there, too? And some pills, in case I get a headache from the sun. Thanks. -I should have said no. -No to what? -Going on this trip. -Why not? Because I don't like leaving you alone. Honey, I can manage on my own. Just go with your buddies and have some fun. Relax, lay out in the sun... But not the 2 o'clock sun, it's bad for you. You're so good. -Here. -What are these for? Your flatulence. I don't know what I'd do without you. Will you bless me? May God be with you. That girl, Pola-- She's Eduardo Gurrea's cousin, remember? Of course. Eduardo owned a grocery store called "La Giralda." Oh, Pola... I was in love with Pola. Antolín, look, if someone dressed Frankenstein like a bride, you'd ask for her hand in marriage. -Please, pull over, I need to get out. -Again? I need to pee, what can I do? It's the second time you're making me stop. -I can either pee in here or out there-- -Yeah, yeah, yeah. We can go. We can go. Hey, do you usually pee in the middle of the night? -I do. -How many times? I don't know. Two or three. Is it a heavy stream or a low stream? I don't know. I'm not totally awake when I get up. I don't know if it is a heavy stream, a low stream or a few drops... -Do you remember Lola Cantú? -Oh, man. Those big green eyes. What a hottie. The only thing I didn't like was that she salivated too much when she talked. Little bubbles would gather in the corner of her mouth. How picky. Mariano, not so fast. -Don't speed. -Don't piss me off, Antolín. Boys, there's a cop hot on our tail. I told you. Damn it, you are speeding. Fine. Let's pull over. Stop. And miss the thrill of a life time? No way. This is my first time being chased by a cop. And they won't get us. Antolín is right, damn it. Pull over. Leave me alone. Damn it. Pull over. Stop fooling around. Antolín is right. Pull over, damn it. Don't piss me off. Come on, they'll think we're with a cartel. -Hit the brakes, man. -Pretend you're sick. Squirm like you're suffering with acute appendicitis. Get out slowly with your hands up. Hurry. Don't shoot. Don't shoot. We're innocent people. I'm Engineer Mariano Montero. I'm taking a sick friend to the hospital. License and registration, please. -Hey, my friend is sick and you want-- -License and registration, please. And you, show me your ID, please. Sure. Of course. I'm sick! I'm sick! I'm very sick! Why did you try to escape, sir? I wasn't. I'm telling you, I'm taking a sick friend to the hospital. -Where are you coming from? -Mexico City. -We're on our way to Acapulco. -Is that right? What's in your trunk, sir? In the trunk? Nothing. Nothing. -Hey! Help me! -Open the trunk. -I'm telling you, my friend... -Please open the trunk, sir. Open it, it's okay. Please, help! -Help! Please! -But this doesn't end here. I'm going to file a complaint with Human Rights. -International Human Rights. -It's only clothes. You're gonna regret this. I'm going to die. Fine. We'll escort you to the exit. -Drive carefully, use your headlights. -Thank you, Officer. -Good morning. -Good morning. I have a reservation. Mariano Montero. Mariano Montero. Yes, sir. Just a moment. Can you fill out these registration forms, please? If you would, please. Could you fill it out for me? I didn't bring my glasses. -Of course, sir. -Thank you. Your name? Justo Monroy. Profession? Joker. Thank you. Yes? Thank you. Hello? Viviana. It's me, honey. How was your trip? Great, great. Very uneventful. We just arrived. I'm talking from my room that has an ocean view. Don't go for a swim in the ocean. You know how polluted it is. Don't worry. You know I don't like the sea. Hey, I wish you were here with me. Just imagine we're together. Don't forget to take your blood pressure pills. I just took them. -Hey, Vivi, you know something? -What, honey? I wish I could make love to you right now. You're crazy. You are so crazy. Have fun with your friends. But stay away from those bad women. Please, don't say that. I love you. And I love you. Bye. Oh, Viviana. -Hey! -Howdy! How are you feeling? A little tired, but I'm fine. Good, good. I just talked to Viviana. She told me to say hi. Does she still call you "honey"? Yes. Ever since we got married. What do you want to drink? I don't know. What are you drinking? Planter's Punch. It's what the three of us used to drink. Waiter! One non-alcoholic Planter's Punch. What do you mean, non-alcoholic? That's just plain orange juice. I just took my blood pressure medication. They may not mix well. Thank you. What are you thinking about? That the best way to throw away your youth is being young. You are so deep... that you are bottomless. Look at those two steaks with onions over there. If we were 50 years younger, we'd be chatting them up. Right. That brunette reminds me of that friend we had. Her name was Zoila Contreras, remember? I remember a girl... whose waist was wide enough to shelter 12 to 13 people. You are as crude as crude can be. You should've said she was wide at the encounter point. Those are two stupendous steaks. Let's talk to them. Come on, Justo. Get real. Can't you see we're a couple of old grumpy men? No, you and Mariano are grumpy old men... Well, I am too. But I am an old grumpy man who's gonna hit on those girls. Go ahead. I'll catch up with you later. And fix your rug! I'm sorry, we don't speak English. Yeah, neither do I. I was just fooling around. My name is Justo Monroy. And I'm willing to buy you whatever you want to drink. Nice to meet you, Justo. I'm Miriam and this is my friend Sandy. -Sandy, nice to meet you. -Likewise. What would you like to drink? I'll have a Clamato with a lot of vodka. And you? I'll have a Clamato, too. No. No, I changed my mind. Do you have champagne? Can I have a glass, please? Yeah, that's better. Make it two. Oh, that's great. Where are you from? Monterrey. We're just visiting for a few days. I'm from Mexico City. The much hated chilangos. I don't know why, but you remind me of someone that I really loved. A former boyfriend? A loved one? Who? My grandfather, may he rest in peace. Your grandfather... -Hello. -Dad? Rafaela, sweetheart. How's your trip? It's great. Great. Very peaceful. How are your friends? Older, but happy. How's the weather? It's insanely hot. And how are my grandkids? They're great. They're wondering where you are. Tell them grandpa sends many kisses. I will, Dad. Well, enjoy yourself. Have fun. Send Justo and Antolín kisses for me. Of course. You know you're the most important thing in the world to me, don't you? Yes, I know, Dad. I love you very much, honey. Love you forever. -Justo. -Hey, Mariano. Come on. Let me introduce you to Miriam and Sandy. Nice to meet you, ladies. The girls will be joining us for dinner tonight. Oh, that's great. It'll be a pleasure. -Great. Thank you. -Yeah. -See you later. -See you. -See you later. -See you later. Look. It's just like when I was in my prime. What do you think about those two hotties? Justo are you insane or something? Why? You think I want to look like a fool by asking some teenagers for dinner? -Why not? -They'll accuse us of sexual harassment! Sexual decline would be more like it. Look, those girls could be your daughters. Can't you see that? What I see is that they're both amazingly hot. So hot, they might burst into flames. And besides, I don't have any daughters. He's a pervert, Mariano. Okay, I am. But don't let me die alone. -Enough. Let's get something to eat. -Let's see what we find at the beach. -The redhead is mine. -Yeah, right. So, what's up? Why did you ask us to come back to Acapulco? For three reasons. First, because you were my best friends in high school. Second... because I'm seriously considering seeing Carmen Madrigal again. And the third reason... to screw up your trip back. How are you going to screw up our trip back? Forget it. I didn't say anything. Carmen Madrigal. She was such a beautiful girl. But it's been 50 years. She must have a bunch of children. Why look for her? I have my reasons. Oh, sweet Lord. Hey, don't you think Mariano is being weird? -I don't know. Why? -He didn't eat anything. He didn't even touch his food. And he's pale and doesn't look so great. Look, you're a hypochondriac. You think everyone is sick. -Where are you going? -To take a leak. And then I'm gonna lie down for a minute. Well, I'll be in my room. Call me if there are any plans. -Sure. -And you should see a urologist. You're Cheetah. And my Tarzan will be here any minute. What's with the suit? What about it? Pink panther? It's linen. I know it's linen, but... This is the kind of suit being worn in every cosmopolitan city, like Acapulco. Or do I also have to explain what Acapulco is? The redhead is mine. Shameless chicks. They have no consideration. No, really. they have no shame. A suitable punishment for your perversity. I invested a fortune on them this morning, and she couldn't even wave. No, "Hi, Justo." Nothing. Shameless chicks. Come on, now. You made a bad investment, that's all. Well, what are we gonna do? What can I get you? Whiskey. The whole bottle? The whole bottle. I ordered whiskey for the three of us. No, I wanted to drink whiskey. This is too loud. I'm gonna lose my hearing. No, you'll get used to it. What did he say? He told you to shut up! Mariano! Mariano! Mariano! -Are you feeling better? -Yes, I'm feeling better. Everything just started spinning, but I'm fine now. You should get checked by the hotel doctor. Why don't you let a doctor examine you? I'm fine. I'm good. I don't need a doctor to examine me. You look pale, and you know what? I've noticed that you're not eating, Mariano. Fainting is a sign that something is wrong with your body. -You shouldn't ignore this. -Listen, listen... Why don't you two go to your rooms? Tomorrow at 5 a.m., a boat will be waiting to take us fishing. -At 5 a.m. -That's right. Hey, what if I gave you one of my blood pressure pills? -Maybe it's your pressure and-- -Please leave. Hey, calm down. We're leaving now. We'll be nearby, in case you need us. -You know that. -Get out. The Doctor's extension is 302. -I said get out. -Three, zero, two. Leave. Three hundred and two. The first to catch a fish will be buying the beer. Smile, guys. Don't look so worried. This one is perfect. I'm going to zoom in. I'm going to pee. I can't hold it any longer. -Let me help you, man. -Yes. I'll take you there. -Just leave me outside. -Sure, man. I'm telling you, something's wrong with Justo's prostate. You should get a check-up, too. You're fainting the other day... your pale complexion, and your lack of appetite.... -It's no use, Antolín. -Why do you say that? -Because I'm going to die. -Please. We are all going to die. That's why you should prepare. I have everything prepared. My will is ready. -Let's change the subject. -Why? You know? Life is a bad joke. That's right. Life's a joke. Why do you say that life is a bad joke? We didn't ask to be born. And we leave without wanting to. Don't you think that's not fair? Well, you know, I never thought about it that way. I think that life is beautiful. So beautiful that it should be enjoyed until the last minute. You know, I have something to do. I'll see you at the hotel. I took while because... I was peeing... a very, very small stream. I'm telling you, it's your prostate. Who the fuck said that old age is the golden age? Old age is the golden age? Old age is the age of aches and pains. That's what they should have said. It's like my grandma used to say. Oral sex is a matter of conversation. -What's up? -Hey. What did you buy? Tamarind sweets, for my wife. Aren't you going to buy something? I don't have a wife. -Your life is so sad. -Oh, fuck off. Here it comes. I'll have the same, but with less ice. -Cheers. -Cheers. Why do you think my life is sad? Because you never married, you never had a house. You didn't have any children. Look, first of all... I don't think I'm a man who can only be with one woman. Second, I have an apartment that I really like. I fixed it up. It is my home. And third, I never wanted to have children. What you're saying is right, but... you're going to die alone, with no wife by your side. Is that why you got married? So you wouldn't die alone? -Your drink. -Thank you. -Cheers. -Cheers. To the old times. Lighten up. Look at the girls. Look how pretty they are. Jeez. Justo... Don't you see that we're old? No. Don't forget that the old oak gives good shade. No, no, no. Besides... I'm not old. Then why do you use that toupee? I don't know. I was going bald and someone said, "Try this." I thought I looked good. I don't know. I just kept on using it. I feel... I feel tired. That's because you take so many pills. Finish your drink and get some rest. Take it with you. -You're right. I'll see you later. -Cheers. -Bye. -Yeah. Welcome, sir. What can I do for you? I want to see Mrs. Carmen Madrigal. She's out on a delivery. You can tell me what you need. -We have gorgeous flowers. -Oh, no. Thank you. I just wanted to see Mrs. Madrigal. She's my mom. Are you her daughter? You look surprised. Well, no... I am. Look, the thing is... I knew your mom many years ago. And I came back hoping to say hi, but... I bet your dad won't like that. Oh, don't worry about that. My mom's been divorced for years. -I'm sorry, what's your name? -Micaela. -You're a very beautiful woman, Micaela. -Thank you, Mister...? Mariano. Mariano Montero. -Thank you, Mr. Mariano. -Please, drop the "mister." -Thank you, Mariano. -That's better. Tell me, how long have you known my mother? Oh, well... over 50 years now. In that case, she'll be thrilled to hear from you. Hey, do you have a pen I can use? Thank you. I just want to leave... this card for her... saying what hotel I'm staying in... and my room number. Please give it to her with the prettiest bouquet you have. -Of course, Mariano. -Thank you. Of course. Send the bill to my hotel, please. Okay. Well... -It was great meeting you, Micaela. -Likewise, Mariano. -See you later. -Okay. She got married. Now she's divorced and has a daughter who must be... at least 30 years old. I remember how she used to give herself to me. She made me feel safe. Fulfilled. I married Emilia, she gave me a wonderful daughter who gave me two amazing grandchildren. But I never stopped thinking about her. Maybe I betrayed myself. Or maybe I didn't. I was too young. I feel... nostalgic, but I ask myself... why? Why nostalgic? I don't have a precise moment. However, I met a woman... and she kissed me, and I kissed her. And she made me... She made me change my perspective. Maybe I'll look for her. Maybe... Maybe I'm just an old man... who's growing cornier by the minute. What are you talking about? Myself. Didn't you hear what I just said about Carmen? What did you say? You should learn how to listen to people. Well, I was listening to myself. Yes, hello. Carmen. Mariano. Where were we? You told me you'd come back and marry me. Are you here to keep your promise? What I would really like to do is turn back time. It's been many years. I thought you'd forgotten me. I never stopped thinking about you. What about you? You were my first love. When... When you called and Micaela gave me your message, I couldn't help but feel butterflies in my stomach. Have a seat. Thank you. So? What's going on in your life? How are you? Well... I got my degree in Engineering. I got married. I have a daughter, Rafaela, who's given me two wonderful grandkids. What about your wife? Tell me about her. She died three years ago. I'm very sorry. Well, now tell me about yourself. I got married two years after my father died. I married the wrong man. At first, there were ups and downs, but we managed. When my daughter was born... he started drinking because he was frustrated for being the father of a girl. He would get drunk and hit me in front of my daughter. What a jerk. This hell continued until I managed to get a divorce. And it's been 10 wonderful years since we last heard from him. Hey, your daughter is gorgeous. I suppose she's married. She's not attracted to men. Do you remember when we used to skinny dip on this beach? How could I forget? Why did you come back? For two reasons. The first one is that I really wanted to see you again. -What's the second? -Later. So, how are Justo and Antolín? Justo is a confirmed bachelor. He never married. And, well, he's in the car business. Antolín did get married. He has two children and three grandkids. He always worked for the government. Now he lives off his retirement and has bakery with his wife. Say hi to them for me. You'll be able to say hi to them personally. They're here, too, and can't wait to see you. I would love to see them. Hey, want to have lunch with me? I can't make it today. I have to go back to the flower shop, but... how about dinner? -Las Brisas? -At 8:30 pm? Perfect. Would you like to skinny dip with me again? Of course, in a heartbeat. I'll see you tonight. -What are you doing here? -Waiting for you. They just kicked us out of the hotel. What do you mean they kicked you out? Yeah, they said we only had a reservation for two nights. Soon, they'll be kicking you out of your suite. I'll take care of this. This is a sign that we should go back to Mexico City. -A sign? -Yeah, it's a sign that if we stay something wrong may happen. Hey, what do you mean, we have to leave the hotel? Sir, you only booked rooms for two nights. No, no. I told my secretary to leave the checkout date open. But your secretary only booked the rooms for two nights. Okay, but... you could at least help us find another hotel. -I'll do our best, sir. -Thank you. -We'll be at the bar. -Go ahead. -I propose a toast to Carmen. -Good, good. Are you not feeling well? Are you sick? Yes, I have a sharp pain in my chest. Hey, does she still remember us? I'm telling you, she still keeps pictures of the three of us together. I don't know why I feel so tired. Look, if you feel sick... have a drink, something dry. No, no. I took two blood pressure pills when I left the room. You should have taken just one, damn it. How is she? I mean, her body and all that. Time has been good to her. She's very attractive. -What about her daughter? -She's very attractive, too. She's 30 and single. I'm certain you will flirt with her. No. You think? Well, do you have any plans with Carmen? Well, we're going out for dinner... and since she wants to see you, we'll probably make plans for tomorrow. Tomorrow? What do you mean? How long are we staying in Acapulco? As long as it takes. Sir, I'm sorry, I couldn't find you any rooms. -No, no, this can't be happening. -It can. I'm telling you, it's a sign. I'm going to call Delfín. Here it is. Cincho will help us out. That's a good idea. Of course. -Are you Delfín's friends? -Yes, we are. We want the three best rooms in this hotel. I have one room with three beds. Oh, well... if there's no other choice... We don't allow prostitutes, alcohol or parties of any kind. My friends are good men, as you can see. Beach towels are 30 pesos per person. I'll take them to their room. Well, boys, get some rest and get ready... because I'm taking you to La Quebrada. -We'll have lots of fun. -Thank you. Yeah, thanks. -Thank you, Delfín. -I want the bed by the window. What a depressing place. God. When you were young, you didn't complain about the rooms we shared. He would stay anywhere. When I was young, I'd even stay with ugly women. When you're young, ugly women are pretty. And after a couple of drinks, they're even more stunning. That's true. Mariano. What's with the gun? You have never used a gun. Yes, I know, I brought it... just in case. I'm going to take a bath and go have dinner with Carmen. Do you remember that diver we knew? -That we knew? -Right. Yeah, he was a good diver, but he told us that he swam among sharks and he slapped them. They used to call him "Chupetas." Oh, yeah. Right. The "Chupetas." Right. But I think he was just bluffing. Damn it. When are you going to stop being so skeptical? I only believe in what I see. You don't believe in God, then. -Hail Mary, man. -Of course I believe in God. Imagine if you didn't. But you said you only believe in what you see. I'm not going to have this discussion with you. -Why not? -Because you're an atheist, and we would never agree. Well, what happened with last evening's date? Well... she had to leave this morning. She took the first flight out and must be getting to Mexico City right now. I have to call her. So, did you two go all the way? Delfín, come here. I'm going to teach you something. Gentlemen never kiss and tell. And they never wear a toupee. Mariano. Sorry I'm late. You look great. -So do you. -Thank you. Allow me. Thank you. What do you want to drink? Whatever you're drinking. Bring another one of these for the lady, please. Meanwhile, you can try mine. I will find out all your secrets. There aren't many. It's delicious. Mariano, I can't believe it. What? That after so many years without seeing each other, we're here in this place, you and I, holding hands. You know? You brought many things in me back to life. Like what? Well... memories. Feelings. The passion of a first love. Thank you. To the past. To the future. I don't have much of that left, Carmen. Why do you say that? Because... life is slipping through my fingers. At some point, we all have felt what you're describing. -Cheers. -Cheers. Anyway, life goes on. Now can you tell me the second reason why you came back? You'll find out soon enough. Mariano, don't be mean. I'm intrigued. Tell me. Here, we should check the menu and order dinner. You're mean. What were we a hundred years ago? Nothing. Something. I don't know. I have no idea. What will we be in a hundred years? Dust. I guess we will be dust. Dust, right. Dust... in love. That sounds very nice. I borrowed it from Quevedo. What's wrong, Mariano? -What's going on with you? -Why do you ask? Because you didn't touch your food. And you look so sad. Well... I can't be hungry when I'm with a woman like you. I think... you should take me home. Are you scared? Yes. Did you know that Johnny Weissmuller, Tarzan in the American films, had a house here? -Here? -Here in Acapulco. And he died here. When they were burying him, they played a record with his yell... And the guy was being buried. -That's not true. -It is. Cheetah told me. No, but a man who came here all the time was Frank Sinatra, "The Voice." Sinatra was such a great singer. Acapulco, Acapulco. You sing just like him. Just like Blue Eyes. I should have married Sophia Loren. It wasn't Sophia Loren, it was Sofía Quiñones. You just ruined my poetic moment. Besides, both Sofías looked alike. When you're drunk, you always say the same things. No, no, no, no. No. I don't know why I didn't marry her. -Because you're a misogynist. -Oh, really? You like women very much, but deep down you hate them. Because... because you see your mother in them. Leave my mom out of this. -Why? -She's sacred. -Besides, I don't know why you'd say that. -Tell me... Tell me why, even though you've met many women, you never had a serious relationship with any of them. Why? -Why? -I can't answer that. -Why not? -I need to pee. The police. -Oh, too late. -The police. Hey. What are you doing? I am peeing, officer. That's what I am doing. I can see that. The street is not a public bathroom. Forgive him, sir. My friend has prostate problems. That's why he needs to pee constantly. Right. But your friend just committed a felony. No, no. I'm sorry, Officer, but no. The law states that when someone urinates on the street they're breaking the law, but not committing a felony. Come on. Forgive him this one time. We're having such a great time here, -in Acapulco. -Right. Please. -It's nothing to you. -Give us a break. -Come on. -Okay. I'll let you go this time. But next time, I'm warning you, -I'll arrest you. Is that clear? -Thank you, officer. I really appreciate your empathy... Come on. Let's go back to the hotel. Tell me the truth. Do I look like Frank Sinatra? You're a dead ringer. Be quiet. You're snoring very loudly. Seriously? You'll see... Gentlemen, you're disturbing everyone's sleep. -You started it. -Stop it, man. -Let's go to sleep. -Okay. Good night, fuckers. Good night. Good night. That's enough. Fold your arm, please. Thank you, sir. Mariano, I don't have very good news. Tell me everything, Jorge. Don't hide anything from me. Mariano, there's nothing we can do. The tumor is located in an area impossible to access without any damage. How long? Three or four months. Five at most. I'm sorry, Mariano. They're here. Welcome! Justo. Antolín. -Mariano. -You look beautiful. Welcome. -Hi, Antolín. -How are you? -It's been so many years. -Let's not count. -Justo. -Carmen. -You look exactly the same. -Thank you. You're very pretty. Gorgeous. Thank you. This is my daughter, Micaela. -How are you? -I could hardly wait to meet you. Me, too. Hi. Hi. This is Mónica, my partner. Hi, Mónica. -Sir. -Hello. Look at this. -You still had hair. -Right. Look at this. Here you are, standing on your head. I'm not standing on my head. I can't do that. I'd scratch my head, or my toupee would fall off. But look at this. Look. That's a beautiful picture. You look gorgeous. Don't you have any more pictures? No, look, this is... This is it. Look at this one. Remember we were a little drunk? The paella is ready. Let's eat. Let's eat. You're going to try Acapulco's best paella. And it's my daughter Mica's recipe. Here, baby, give me a hand. I feel... -What is it, Antolín? -Oh. I feel... I'm not well. Oh, God. -Call an ambulance. Hurry. -He's having a heart attack. -Antolín. -Let me put... Antolín. Oh, God. Antolín, what's wrong? It's a heart attack, Justo. I can't believe this. I can't believe this. Somehow, I did know, but... He told me, but I wouldn't listen. He was always tired, so... -He never said anything to me. -He did tell me. But I didn't understand. Besides, he was adamant about going back to Mexico City. -Really? -Yes. Good afternoon. -Good afternoon. -I'm Dr. Guzmán. Good afternoon, doctor. How's our friend? He had a heart attack, but we got him through. Can we see him? No, not now. He's in the ICU. Well, then... all we can do is wait. That's right, gentlemen. If he's better tomorrow, you may be able to see him then. Thank you. You're very kind. -Thank you. -Excuse me. Go ahead. We should tell Viviana everything. -Justo... -What? I think we should wait. Okay? If you call her now and say Antolín had a heart attack, she'll be really upset. Who's Viviana? Viviana is Antolín's wife. They really love each other... Tell her. Right. They've loved and taken care of each other all their lives. But Viviana suffers from anxiety. That's why I don't think we should tell her right now. Look, I don't know. I don't know what to do. I can't think of anything. You two should do it. Forgive me, I better leave. I'll take a walk and see if I can think of something. Everything's going to be all right. We must not lose our faith. I lost it a long time ago. Why do you say that? Because... I'm the one who's dying. Oh, Mariano. Don't say that. It's true, Carmen. I have... three or four months left to live. I have a cancerous brain tumor. It's inoperable. That's why I'm here. I really wanted to see you again, before I... You shouldn't have come looking for me. Why not? Do you really need to ask? Can't you see I'm going to lose you again? I was selfish. Seeing you again has been so wonderful. But the ending... I don't even want to think about it. I don't want you to say goodbye to me. I don't want you to say goodbye. I want... to live this moment like this. Always. Until we are... dust in love. Just a few minutes, please. You need to hold on, Antolín. You need to hold on. -I don't want to die, Mariano. -No, no. Not here. Viviana would never forgive me for this. I... I want to keep on living. I want to go home. You're not going to die, Antolín. -Not now, at least. -Please... -Don't call Viviana. -We won't. -Don't tell her anything. -We won't, don't worry. Don't worry. Antolín? Can you hear me? I want to say you've been a wonderful friend. Careful. Be careful. I feel good now. Don't worry. Aren't you going to pack your bag? No, I'm too tired. I'll pack tomorrow before we leave. We need enough time to have breakfast with Carmen and Delfín.
