SMOKING IS HARMFUL TO YOUR HEALTH, DO NOT IMITATE WHAT YOU SEE ON SCREEN Honey! Mom, after you died, I tried to hold us together… But nothing I did could fill the void you left. Tenchi, be patient… Damn, this goalie's a beast! Right side. I'm open. Rise and shine, Dad. Shoot! Dad! Sorry Tenchi, be right back! Nice try, sensei. Sun's out. Seize the day. Hurry up! Twenty-eight minutes and 35 seconds until departure! These last few years, I've cooked and eaten on my own. With you gone, it's like Dad forgot how to be a father. - Dad! - I'm ready sweetie! Let me just throw my pants on... You're wearing two. It's okay. KHAI MINH HIGH SCHOOL Coming! Let's go. Say goodbye to Mom. Goodbye, Mom. Wish me luck, Mom. Oh my… Don't you two look cute today. Tonight, I'm gonna come make spring rolls for us. Hai, I'm dying to show you… My special secret rolling technique. Thanks, Miss Lien. But we're in a rush. Let's go. - Miss Lien… - No "miss," just call me Lien. You know how much we love living here. But… she still misses her mom. Dad, you don't want to miss your meeting this morning. That's why she needs someone to take care of her. And that way her dad won't be so lonely either. Turn right, it's faster. Remember you have a call with the CEO at nine. And at five we're observing the anniversary of Mom's death. I'll text you what dishes to pick up. Mom's foundation again? I'm doing her ballet solo for the talent show. Let me grab a coffee. I'm gonna be late. I have a test today. Relax, we'll make it. Iced coffee, please! Why not try some other colors? You don't have to be like Mom all the time. - Fifteen-thousand. - Keep the change. Wait… Dad, I'm gonna be late. Relax. Do you know how many times you've made me late? If I fail this test, my grade drops. Bad grades mean bad college. Bad college means bad job. Hurry or it's gonna be bad. This is a business, not a charity. Just need five… Oops! - Dad! - That's his fault. First you make me late and now this! Have fun at school sweetie! It's been so long but she still can't let you go. When you left, you took our carefree little girl with you. Help me with this. I'll get you! Check out the new model. Later. Don't forget the game tonight. For sure! Here's the cosmetics poster. Let me see. Just finished. Wow… Do it all over. Hey! Sorry. How many times have I told you? No soccer in the office. Hurry up. He's starting. Belie is forging a new strategy for DHC in Vietnam. To grab hold of the growing market… I've decided to shift the cosmetic brand's focus from skincare for working women to make-up for teen girls... Too close! To help, I've flown in DHC's top brand manager from Tokyo. My mom loved him with all her heart. I need you to present the creative marketing ideas. We need a hot new brand image to grab the next generation. It must be so amaz... Enough! It must be so amazing that it will take their parent's money and give it all to us. Good luck. This was your eighth truancy. It's thanks to my dad, miss. Look at my dress. If he hadn't been up all night, we wouldn't need to stop for coffee. How do you think I get here? By bike. I cycle here! But I'm never late. Even when I pop my tires. You'll stay after class to clean up. But miss… I have a ballet audition. Can we reschedule? Ballet? I love ballet. But I can't dance ballet. I don't care. Ladies and gentleman, our new marketing idea. WINNING - Winning? - Exactly. It represents the ideal modern woman. Sophisticated, smart and beautiful. And she owes it all to DHC. What do high school girls want? High grades and a lot of… Likes. Everything's a competition. But winning isn't everything. - That's right. - Right? But winning… is winning. Hai, any ideas? Let me clear my head. Five minutes. He'll have something. Definitely. THE GREAT THING - KHANH NGUYEN Excuse me. Youth all want to win. But they are easily led astray. Everyone has heroes. But is it good to always live in someone else's shadow? We should help them find their own path. Whether they're the beauty queen or bookworm. Our make-up should be a canvas to express yourself. It's not about "Winning." It's about discovering your… TRUE TRUE COLOR True Color. That's it! You're a genius! Why does every angle make me look fat? Viri, what's the best selfie angle to distort your body? The best way to distort yourself is… Eat less. Ignore her. You're already on the cucumber diet. Can you fit into your mom's tutu yet? It's still tight. But it won't matter if I miss my audition. You should ditch Miss Phuong's detention. This is your big chance! You want to be stuck taking care of your dad forever? Viri, what's the prize this year for Miss Talented Saigon? Miss Talented Saigon top prize to the college of your choice. See? What if we ask Coach Hoang to put you last? He already refused. What if we give him mangos mixed with laxatives? Dad, write this down. Okay, sweetie, I'm writing. Spring rolls, ham, boiled chicken, sticky rice. Oh, and egg tarts. Almost in! What's in? Sorry. I was just telling them to come in and work. Okay, soccer tarts. What else? Soccer tarts? I said egg tarts! Right, I meant egg tarts. Goal! Don't forget, they're Mom's favorite. I know. Penalty kicks, Mom's favorite. Did you hear a word I just said?! - Oops, I know. - Code red! Code red! Sorry, I gotta go. I'll handle everything. …so in the presentation, we'll have photos of all kinds of girls… Come, join in. The girls don't all have to be tall. Fifty-percent. You answered correctly, but only finished half the test. You did great. If I hadn't been late, I would've gotten 100. Has your dad signed your release to study abroad yet? Isn't this important to you? I'll give it to him tonight. Next. KHAI MINH MISS TALENT COTEST That's it? Next. At least that was a bit creative. Vu, clean the stage. Next. Who's next? Pham Ngoc Chau. YOU'RE UP, HURRY! - Miss… - What? Talking to you was super fun. But can I leave just a bit early? No. Chau, you're up! - Chau! - Coach, have some mangos. My stomach's weak. Eating street food is dangerous. It's okay my mom made them. If Chau's not here, she's disqualified. HOPE THE MANGOS WORK, JUST GET HERE BY FOUR! Miss… Please let me go. It's just five more minutes. I've learned my lesson. Please… Thank you! Hello? Boiled chicken, sticky rice-what else? Didn't you write it down? I can't talk now, Dad! I think the juggling girl was cool. The karate girl was better. - Sorry, I'm not feeling well. - Coach Hoang… - Coach Hoang. - Please wait. Let go. Chau, why were you late? But I'm here now. Auditions are over. Now it's time for… The fireworks. But Miss Phuong gave me detention. That's your business. - Coach… - Yen, stop packing up. - I said don't pack up. I need to audition! - What are you doing? Don't touch my headphones. Get off! Coach… Slow down, please. Get off. I'm gonna explode! How about tomorrow? After class, just ten minutes. Tomorrow? Those mangos are so evil. Do you want us to win? I practiced more than anyone. You'll love my dance. One more word and I'll blow! - But this is important… - Just this time, please. I'm begging you! Out of my way! - This is really important to me! - I am begging you. - Please help us! - Just this time. Okay, fine! Tomorrow! - Thank you, coach. - Move! Chau… Why didn't you answer my text? If you still don't know… Then dumping you was the right choice. Viri, how many chances does a guy have to get back with his ex? If she dumped him, then it's a locked door. Hear that? Zidane… Zidane… - Dad, watch out! - It's fine. Uncle! If the girl wants to play then let's fly! Just like you… Grandpa… Can you sign this? What's this? Parental Release… You should really have your dad sign this. You can't hide this from him forever. You know, being on his own can help him grow up too. Hello? Everyone had to audition today, so it's unfair to let you go tomorrow. But you wouldn't let me go today. Wasn't it because you were late? I had detention! I can't let the others say I'm giving you special treatment. - But coach… - Not another word. It's your fault you were late. In! Go inside! Okay, I'm hanging up. But this is my best shot at... I've made up my mind. Do you know how hard it is to study abroad? How can you do this to me? No auditioning tomorrow. That's final! Coach… I'm sorry, Mom. Dad. What's up? What do you see? - The altar? - Mom's egg tarts? Crap. - Let me go get some. - It's too late now! It's okay. Are you worried offerings at night will make mom fat? How can you joke about this? I asked you so many times. How could you forget? It's just this one time. You know how important this is? Let's talk at home. It's no big deal. Nothing to you is a big deal. Not my studies. Not my ballet audition. Not even my future. You know what really is a big deal? Mom died so long ago, but she still understands me more than you. He knows he messed up. Go talk to him. I hope he falls down a hill. How can she say that to me? MRS. LE MY TAM I understand her better than anyone. Did you apologize to Mom? I'm not a kid! You see? She thinks she's you. How come you always run away? Grow up! So I can be miserable like you? Better miserable than a pushover. You know why you're miserable? Because you can't admit Mom's dead! No, it's because of you! Don't point that in my face! Thank god I'm not you, otherwise I'd be a total loser! Go ahead. Be a dad for once! Bugs! It's just a few bugs. Chau… Chau! Chau! Dad… Chau! Chau! Chau… - Are you okay? - How could you hit me? Are you okay?! I said I'm fine. Sorry, I almost had a heart attack. Dad. Storm's coming. Chau. Sweetie? Chau? What's wrong? Chau! Chau, wake up! Chau… Chau… Chau! You can't leave me! Don't leave me on my own! Chau… I was choking, and you ignored me. I'm sorry sweetie. Are you okay? You are me? You are me? This is all your fault! My fault? I saved your life! I gave you CPR! Where's my vape? How can I do ballet with these two logs? Your body's stiff as a rock. Don't smoke in my body! Can you try choking again? I just choked. You choke. You choked in your body. Try it in mine. Stop joking around! God, I'm so strong. How dare you push a girl! You're not a girl! How dare you push your dad! Look again, do you look like my dad? Why are your lips so big? What are you doing? Shove it down your throat. You want to kill me? It's too big. How about this? This one's so tiny! Just a little bigger, okay? Open up… You want to do ballet or not? It's not sashimi, Dad! Open wide! Just let it crawl in. Just go slow. Push it in for me! What? It's in my stomach. Let's find another. CHAU AROUND THE GLOBE Chau, dear! "Chau dear"? Have some breakfast. Oh no, I forgot the chili. I don't want breakfast. I know you still miss your mom. But you two can't keep living like this. Let me take care of you both. Okay? - Dad! - That's him! He'll flip if he sees me here! Dad, I'm still you. Who's that? Lien? Hai… Don't be mad. I can explain. What are you doing in my body? I was just fooling around with Lien. How can you joke right now? Calm down. I know what to do. Let's just tell her the truth. Who's gonna believe us? You haven't even tried. What's going on? The truth is, I'm not really the daughter of… My daughter. It's true. What kind of game is this? See, you're freaking her out. Who's this? My wife. Back then, I was still a man. But now we've swapped bodies so… Okay, this is creepy. I'm going. Wait! Lien… I can prove to you I'm Hai. Something only you and I know. You took some selfies for me. You got a tattoo… A heart… right on your ass! What? No! It's up here! That was our little secret! How could you tell her that? Why? Lien… Dad's telling the truth. Last month… You came over asking for tampons. I offered you one, but you took my whole box! Oh my god. You still haven't returned them. You… I'm leaving. What kind of messed up family shares such private details?! See? Who's gonna believe us? Chau… Slow down. You don't have your license. Relax and let me drive. Sit up straight. I look like a dwarf. Remember… No smoking. No carbs. No ditching class. My attendance is perfect. When you see Khanh ask her to help me get another audition. But if I'm you, how can I do ballet? I don't know ballet. You messed up so you have to fix this. Find Coach Hoang and get me an audition. Got it? Yes, I got it. At noon sharp, you have to post a selfie. You know how to? Above the head. Soft lighting. Whose make-up is that? It's a new color. Not Mom's. See how pretty you are when you match your own skin tone? Whatever. In the photo, make sure to pout your lips like a fish. Hey, gorgeous! Hey, Vu! What's up? I'm good. What's so funny? Stay away from my daughter! I thought you were friends? Please don't talk to Vu. Just focus on ballet and studying. And let me worry about your job. Okay. But you need to be careful of Nhung. She wants to sabotage your pitch. And if she wins over the CEO you're all screwed. All you need to remember is Nhung, no! Binh, yes! Got it? I know. Hurry or you'll be late. What the hell? Wow. The big boss from Japan is coming, so now you're Mr. Serious. Greetings, Mr. Miyamoto. I am Miyamoto from the Tokyo headquarters. Please allow me to enter. You know Japanese. Go ahead, translate. A pleasure to meet you. A pleasure to meet you. Pardon me. I arrived earlier than expected, so I came to meet the creative team. I'm glad someone here speaks Japanese. He says, he is really sorry. But he only has one business card left. That's all he said? Japanese sounds long, but the meaning is short. Please, sir. This layout is so creative. No division between individual and communal workspace. So… Individualism and conformity go hand in hand. This is an ideal atmosphere that maximizes individual and team efficiency. These monstrous decorations look like they were stolen from a kindergarten. He hates them. Throw them out. Bring desks and chairs in and line them up neatly. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hey, this isn't Japan! - We are having fun. - Does he know anything about creativity? I've arrived in… An outdated library. Avant-garde museum. This belongs to an exemplary worker. And this is a pigsty. He's beyond disappointed. An office must have a desk. I'm ashamed I was enslaved to such a shallow notion. This person not only enjoys life, but also takes pride in their work. Unfettered by convention… This worker soars like a white crane. Without a doubt, an amazing creator. This person refuses to grow up. Get your act together… Or I'll fire you! On behalf of the creative team, I will note down your critiques. And fix them immediately. Hai, translate. Translate my ass! Tell him our job requires creativity. Our style is to work hard, play hard. Sorry, I need to go look up work hard, play hard in the dictionary. Dad, there's a Japanese man here! He's talking all crazy. What should I do? I'm in class, can't talk. Wait, help me get him out of here so I don't need to translate. Today, we're going to review yesterday's exam. Starting with question 19. Crap, he's coming! Put your earpiece in. Put your earpiece in. They seem to have something important to tell me. Okay, who needs to translate? Speak up loudly, slowly and clearly. Thank you. Okay… No one got this question right… Except one student. Me? Really? Who else? You're the only one that knows Japanese. Please come up. Translate what I just said. Make sure you use polite words. Sweetie pie… This is question 19… It comes right after 18. Of course, 19 comes after 18. Why are there so many numbers? Okay, I'll translate for Nhung first. Nhung! No! I mean… Don't look at this and get intimidated. It seems hard, but it's actually super easy. Listen and learn kids. The lady said, "Please stay away from me. My mouth smells like fish." This is question 19, and I have to teach it so everyone understands! Hurry up, Chau! There's a zero, and a squiggly line leading up to a one. The whole class is waiting. Then xdx, divided by x plus one, to the third power. Hai, tell him… If he wants to change things, we're quitting! I didn't hear clearly! Then don't translate. There's a zero, then a squiggly line leading to one. Then xdx, divided by x plus one, to the third power. Everyone knows the equation. Tell us how to do it already! Quiet please, Khanh. Don't push her. Chau, hurry up! Calm down, miss, I'm trying to remember how I did it yesterday. Crap, I forgot work hard, play hard already. Let me think. When I learned "work hard, play hard"… I was playing and working hard on a math problem. That's right. And that problem was… Oh, I got it! Definite integral from zero to one. Open bracket, open parenthesis, x plus one, close parenthesis… Negative two power, subtract open parenthesis, x plus one, close parenthesis… To the negative third power, close bracket, dx. There, that's the math problem. Now, I'll translate for you. What next? Chau, can you please do it faster? Wait miss, give me some time to think. Oh, I've got a good one! This lady said, "Thank you so much for visiting. It's an honor to meet you." Thank you for the warm welcome. May I ask who the creative office belongs to? Did you hear all that? Heard it all and know it's Japanese. I only heard something about a "creative office." Chau! There's no creativity in math. Just apply the formula to get the answer. - One-eighth, one-eighth, one-eighth! - Do it quickly! One-quarter minus one-eighth equals one-eighth! That's the answer to the problem I was playing and working hard on. One-four minus one-eight equals one-eight? How can 14 minus 18 be 18? Are you high, Chau? Enough! Chau, if you can't solve this problem. You're staying after class to clean up! Sir, please tell me whose office that is. Chau. Chau… Chau! In my humble opinion! A creative soul… Doesn't need praise for their work. They just need their creation… To be cherished! I apologize. I was being shallow. Do it! Do it! Do it now! One-quarter minus one-eighth… The answer is one-eighth. Exactly! I learned a valuable lesson today. Thank you. Were you just speaking Japanese? When I do math… I do it using the Japanese method. You use Japanese method? Teach me sometime. Didn't we agree to ignore the Japanese boss? I didn't agree to that. I liked his ideas. You're spineless. He's right. What's the point of being stubborn? We have to know what the boss wants… In order to present a good idea. Like "Winning"… Not that "True Color" nonsense. Right? Say what you want. But I should have done this long ago. My daughter's been telling me I need to get serious. She wants you to be a winner. A dozen signatures! With so many supporters, there's no way coach can refuse you now. Khanh? You're trying to help me get back in the talent show? Not trying. It's done. You just need to sign. Thank you. But I don't need to audition anymore. I don't even like ballet. What?! I thought you wanted to make your mom proud? I'd rather make my dad proud. What? What's so funny? I see now… You're the one pushing her. Bad friend! Life's not a contest. You should enjoy yourself. Go take a selfie! Viri, what's wrong with Chau? It's that time of month. This angle's bad. But she's hot right? Just like her mom. Top of her class. Great at ballet. Plans to study abroad. A human encyclopedia. Math prodigy. Make-up pro. Insta-famous. Chess club treasurer. And a great chef too. You're really proud of her. She's the best thing that ever happened to me. I wish I had a dad like you. Wow… There must be a dung heap nearby. Hai, come with me. Come on! Don't just sit there. Nhung's idea is so superficial. Every girl wants to be pretty. There's nothing wrong with that. But being pretty doesn't mean you have to change who you are. Is that what you want to teach young girls? That to be a "winner," they have to be like Nhung? She's gonna kill me… Soft light. Let me… It's alright. I took a selfie last week and fell down the stairs. It's lucky I ran into you. Did your dad sign the release form? What release form? The parental release form. Release for what? To study abroad. My dad just found out. Oh, almost forgot… Without that release, you can't apply for scholarships. Got it. Get to class. Everyone, get to class! Hey, Vu! - You. - What's up? Got any cigs? Huh? Since when do you smoke? Give me a cig and I'll show you. For real? If not, then give me some booze. You asked the right guy. Come on. The reason I called this meeting… Is because I have an important announcement. Hai has changed his mind. What? He wants to present "Winning" to the CEO. Actually, she's right. Did you forget what we talked about at lunch? Why are you so upset? I don't want to change the world. I just want to be a winner. You're gonna ruin the whole company! Don't you mean… Lift up the whole company! You know nothing about girls! I am a girl! Hello, boss. Hello, CEO. I just met Mr. Miyamoto. He said that someone in this department… is a genius. I want this genius to lead our new marketing campaign. Don't worry, sir. You'll know who the genius is once you see our presentation. I already have an office waiting for them on the management floor. Sit… I'm glad I came up here. For sure. This is what school should be like. If I were principal, I'd make every day a party. What's the point of stressing? Can't we just live life? Right? You took the words right out of my mouth. Exactly. Okay, drink! Careful, it's strong. You know… My old man's planning on moving abroad. What? You kidding? Our house is gonna feel so empty. So who's gonna take care of you? Wow… Teach me. Purse your lips. Then puff, like you're coughing. Wrong. Look. Purse your lips. What are you doing, bro? Bro? Come on, stop messing around. I know you want to get back together. Back together? When were we ever together? Or do you have a new Japanese boyfriend? What Japanese boyfriend? Or is it your dad? What if I talk to him? He used to love playing games with me. Because you're just like me. That's why we make the perfect couple! I mean, you're just like my dad. Chau, you alright? - You swallow something? - Chau, what are you doing? Sorry, coach. Wontons? Gross! Detention! You broke all my rules. You smoked. You drank. You ate carbs too, didn't you? No… Okay, a little. But I threw it all up! And see, I remembered to take a selfie. What the hell is this? Delete that right now! Eh? Why is Nhung following you? Did you show her your Instagram? She liked it. She said I was pretty! Don't let her seduce you! I just like her idea for "Winning." Don't joke about that. She's smart and cute. And she likes you too. Are you nuts? I already have your mom! Hello, coach. Coach… Is there any way to let Chau audition? She was late and got detention… Because of me. And that day you were too busy… Lighting fireworks. Chau… You told him that? Coach… I just want it to be fair. Coach, our top girl was injured smashing watermelons. That's right. Please send our condolences. Why am I only hearing this now? Okay. If that's the case, we'll let Chau audition. Thank you. - Don't make me audition! - What? Are you still drunk? Sober up! Sir, calm down! How can she audition if you hurt her? He beats me! Domestic abuse! Is that true? When she's sober, she'll audition. Quiet. Let her speak. Fine. If you don't want to audition… I won't pressure you. I'm sorry, sweetie. Give me a hug. Stop messing around. If you don't audition, I'll disown you! You know just what to say, Dad. Thank you! And you… Drop this "Winning" crap. True Color. Coach… I've decided to audition. My dad's kindness has changed my mind. Next Monday, okay? 1 CONFIDENCE - 2 CHARM 3 SMARTNESS - 4 VIGOROUSNESS BE YOURSELF EXPRESS YOURSELF EMAIL: PPT RECEIVED FROM NHUNG DO - OPEN WINNING Dad, are you ready? Are you? I'm gonna pitch so eloquently, the CEO will think I'm Obama. I'm gonna pirouette so high, coach will think I'm Anna Pavlova. Dad… Say, bye. Goodbye, Mom. Wish us luck, Mom. TRUE COLOR You got my email? Yes. Good. Make sure you mention whose idea this is in your introduction. Remember, if we win, your daughter wins too. Are you ready? Hey, DJ… - Which file? - Tchaikovsky. Boring… I would like to thank the CEO and esteemed managers for joining us. TRUE COLOR - WINNING WINNING First, I would like to tell you a story. My mom is a ballerina. When I was a kid, I would watch her practice. In ballet, there is a famous technique where you step up onto your tiptoes. It appears graceful and effortless. Like a fairy dancing. But to master this skill requires years of practice. As a kid, I saw her injured countless times performing this move. WINNING For my mom, ballet was a constant struggle for perfection. She had a fire burning inside her. And I believe that fire burns inside every young girl. Overcoming obstacles, reaching higher… Put on our make-up and see a goddess staring back at you. A "winner" their mother's would be proud of. Make-up can be washed off. Tones and trends come and go. But "Winning" is a way of life. An emotional connection. A philosophy girls can hold onto as they venture into the world. That kind of connection lasts forever. It can be passed on to their children. Just like my mother did with me. Whether spinning on stage as a swan… Or facing her final days without a hint of fear. This was the last lesson she taught me… Live a life you would be proud of. Because you never know when your life will end. So did my mom. She's always been an inspiration. Chau! Ballet from Shaolin Temple? Duck, swan or dinosaur? Even her hands can dance… Chau! I can't even express how unique and creative that was! Dad! Dad. I can't believe you did it. Did you forget anything? You knew it from top to bottom? Not one missed step. Yeah! And you? Maybe you should sit down. The CEO… Wholeheartedly approved… And absolutely loved… The new marketing idea. I knew you could do it! Do you realize how important this is? We're redefining make-up for millions of girls with… Winning. What? Winning. I went with "Winning"… And "Winning" won. Dad. But he loved it. Your salary's gonna be higher. We'll get you some new suits. And an alarm clock. Because you're now… on the top floor. I'm off the creative team? Dad… He promoted you. You're a manager. Forget the creative team... I love the creative team! Everyone's a zombie up there. That's not me. Aren't you glad you got a raise? Why are you so concerned with my salary? Money can expand your horizons. With more responsibility, you can help people grow. But I love my job. - Don't you want… - What's wrong with that? - Don't you want to realize your potential? - No! Fine. Mom wouldn't have been so selfish. Nothing you do will bring her back, Chau. APPOINTMENT LETTER Something wrong? Sorry, I'm a slow reader. While you've been reading… My assistant's filed all the way from my right pinky to my left. You don't want the job? - I do… - Yes. But I need some time to talk it over with my daughter. Do you think she'll object if your salary is twice as high? Sign it by ten tonight or I'll rip it up. Everyone! Chau's coming. Congratulations. I'm glad you got this chance. I'm sorry I threw up on you. Just come back with the grand prize. If you can throw up on me, you can do anything! Coming through! Amazing! Where did you learn that drunken monkey dance? It just came out. Yeah right! I knew you had tricks up your sleeve. You're getting that fixed? Let me. Tonight, we're making banners for you. I'll fix it and bring it to school. You're coming right? Come on, Chau! Come on, Chau! It smells delicious, sweetie. It's so cute she calls you 'sweetie'. And flowers too! Welcome home, 'sweetie'! Yummy! Chau, you are so lucky your dad's such a great chef. What grade are you in now? One grade higher than last year. She's going to college next year. Any plans for school? Planning is overrated. But you have to prepare for college. I take things one day at a time. Well, someone took the time to prepare this hotpot. That's why it's so tasty. Cheers. My dad doesn't like to drink. You have to treat yourself once in a while. I'd rather sit in my undies and play video games. What? - Nothing. - Why did you kick me? Give me some ice. Why didn't you just say so? So I heard you're gonna perform in a big talent show. My dad's making me do it. You should let him help you. Everyone adored his presentation at work. What's there to adore? Your idea wasn't anything special. The hotpot's boiling. I'll get some ice. Don't move a muscle, Dad. You always get what you want, right? You're just a spoiled brat. I'd rather be spoiled than a bloodsucking vampire. You just want your dad's money to buy fancy toys and show off on Instagram. Well, now he's getting promoted. So you can relax. Congratulations. Actually, I don't need fancy toys or hot Instagram photos. My dad can keep his dream job. But more responsibility… will make me more mature. Hey! CHAU'S GONNA EMBARRASS OUR WHOLE SCHOOL! I THINK IT'S DOPE AND CREATIVE SHE LOOKS FUN YA'LL IS SHE HIGH? What is this nonsense? What? I still made the cut. I look like an idiot! Well, did you turn down the job or not? Dad, if you care about me at all… You're gonna practice that solo until it's perfect. But I have to go to school... No buts! Who uploaded that clip? She drinks every night and has the nerve to say I can't? You did the right thing. If you're not strict… You'll spoil her. You are so right. If you want something… Just take it. If you want it, take it. That was the first time I've kissed a girl. Don't fight it. Let's share our real selves with each other. We're making all these for you. Try it on. See if it fits. Chau! I learned to blow rings. Want to see? Forget it. Do it at your house. It's okay. I love all my fans. Let's go. Hello there, naughty schoolgirl. You like to role play, don't you? What? Remember, we're on the… Winning team! Hai dear, mama's home! I thought your wife was dead? I brought some sweets! Hai… What kind of kinky game are you playing? Gross! You freak! I have to tell you though… I'm not this kind of girl! But for you, I'll bite the bullet and become this kind of girl. Where… should I start? We got back together. We puffed each other's cigs. Got wasted and wild. Bullshit. Relax. We'll make sure to invite you and Viri to our wedding. Are you nuts? We're in school! - Okay, granny. - Enough. You look amazing! Better than amazing. Fire… Fire! - It's burning! - Fire… Fire! Oh god, my tutu! - What? - Your hair! Let's snuggle after… Not hard enough? You love it hard, don't you?! Even harder? God, you really are degenerate. From your butt? Hai… I've thought it over. I don't want us to start off like this. We have to start like a real family. I want you to officially introduce me to Chau. After that, we can do whatever you want. Not good enough? But the most I'll do is a sexy striptease. Wait one sec. You're into older chicks? Untie me and I'll tell you. You're on your own. Hai dear. Are you ready? I'm coming! Hai? Dad! Hai! You're making me run around like crazy. How am I gonna strip for you later? Are we playing hide and seek? It's not mine. Coach, can I go to the hospital? My follicles are fried. Let her go, coach. Quiet! No one's leaving until I get to the bottom of this. It's all my fault. They had nothing to do with it. Throwing up on me wasn't enough? How can you be so depraved? Honestly, I really liked your ballet kung-fu. But I have no choice… You're out of the talent show. Disqualified. Go home! Coach… Chau? What happened? Wait, Chau! I gave it my all. But it got me nowhere. MRS. LE MY TAM I'm sorry, Mom. I met Khanh to get your tutu. But things got crazy and it caught on fire. I know you're mad. Why don't you yell at me? What's the point? It's never your fault. Come on, I'm sorry. Life is so short. I just wanted to do as much as I could. But ballet? Trying to be this perfect dancer? That's not you. You don't get it. It wasn't just the talent show. It was about studying abroad, right? Why did you hide that from me? Were you just going to graduate and disappear? What's wrong with Vietnam? Mom and I turned out okay. Besides, what would I do without you? You did this… On purpose. All that crap about "True Color," and refusing the job. You didn't let me go so that you won't have to be an adult anymore. Chau! You can't just leave like this! It was never about going abroad. It was about escaping you. If Mom were alive instead of you… My life wouldn't be such a disaster! Goodbye, Dad. Chau? Chau, where's your dad? What happened? We got in a fight. He and I also just… Got into it. I should have whipped him harder to knock some sense into him. What? - What? - What happened? Nothing, never mind. Never mind. You two will find a way to make peace. What if I don't want to make peace? What if I just want to run away? You can't avoid him forever. I can if I go abroad. Chau. You hate your dad that much? I just want to be like my mom. Did you ever think that going abroad… Is the best way to discover who you really are? I know you want your dad to be more responsible. But trying to change a man is nearly impossible. At least he's fun, right? Being fun means you don't have to do the dishes or clean the house? Every night… I've seen you practicing that ballet solo. I practiced every night? Of course! We even had to ice your ankle. He was too busy playing games. I can't be my own person because my dad won't grow up. DEAR CEO, IT IS WITH IMMENSE GRATITUDE… - How's your hair? - It's fine. It just feels like bugs are crawling on my scalp. I came to say sorry. - This late? - Actually, that's only part of it. I came to ask you… What are you thinking? You're disqualified. I already made Vu confess. So now you just have to win the talent show to go abroad. Looks like you're our new boss. I'm a manager? A manager that sells out his friends. Actually, I'm not mad. It's just a shame it took me so long to see who you really are. No smoking on the management floor. RE: PROMOTION Dear CEO, it is with immense gratitude and an open heart… that I accept your job offer. I know that to be a manager… I will have to give up my old life. A life I loved. To enter a new world. Where I'll feel out of place and completely alone. But I have to do this for my daughter. She's always inspired me and made me smile through the ups and downs of life. These last few years, I tried to help her rediscover her old self… To overcome her mother's death by embracing a life full of joy. But I forgot that what she needed most from me was… a father. Sir… The meeting's starting. Grandpa? I'm in the back. Are you here yet? You're at my office? No, the talent show! Hai… He completely ignored my deadline. But after I read his email last night… It made me totally soaking wet! I mean my eyes. If you were me, I'm sure you'd have been smitten as well. Let's all welcome him. A man who knows exactly who he is and where he's going. READY A leader with a vision for success! Hai? Hai? I'm sorry. I'm not the person you think I am. I turned down the job. I'm sorry. You were right. Are you nuts? What about the marketing idea? We're all gonna have a lot of work to do. Hey, stop right there! You want me to expose your perverted true colors to the whole company? If you want everyone to know your freaky fetish too… then be my guest. But now… I need to watch my dad do ballet with a bunch of schoolgirls. Hai! NGUYEN HA HIEN HIGH SCHOOL BEAT THE COMPETITORS So is the tutu okay? I had to go off photos I found on Pinterest. It looks great. Thank you. Then why do you look so down? What? I just hope my body remembers what to do. Don't worry. You practiced all night. Chau… Can I talk to you? It's been eating me up inside. I want to say sorry. The one who uploaded your clip… - It was me. - What? At first, I just wanted to mess with your audition. But after I saw your dance, I was blown away. It was so creative! I'm not the only one that loved your ballet kung-fu. When you get out there, give it your all. Good luck! Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the annual Miss Talented Saigon! We got the best and brightest girls from all over the city competing here tonight. Including the brainy girls from the magnet schools! The buff girls from the sports academies! And speaking of talent… Let's give it up for the hottest DJ under 18… DJ Hoang Yen! Now, to introduce our judges. Who will determine the fate of our contestants. Let's give it up for… Phuong Anh Dao! Jun Pham! And the dancing queen herself, Khanh Thi! First contestant, show us what you got! Give her a big hand! One ticket. No tickets. Do you have an invite? I don't have one. But one of the contestants… Is my dad. Sir, take mine. But what about you? Don't worry. Go ahead. Did you apologize to coach? Suspended for two weeks. But it's cool, I'm used to it. Let's jump the gate. No. I shouldn't. But you're good at this kind of thing. Sir, do you know why Chau dumped me? Because I was too busy playing around. I never took anything seriously. Or cared about what was important to Chau. Right now, Chau needs you in there. Go ahead. I think… Chau needs you in there too. Now, representing Khai Minh High School… Let's welcome Pham Ngoc Chau! What's taking so long? Let's do kung-fu! Dad! Sweetie? What's wrong? Sir, get back. True color! What's going on? My daughter's out there. I have to stay. Wow, what's this? On three, hit the lights. Wow, look at her smoke! Don't worry people, that's not a cigarette, that's a vape. Ballet and vape! Amazing! Wow and now there's… kung-fu! It's like drunken boxing! It's… a butterfly! Dad! Sweetie. Watch out! Dad! Dad! Chau! - Dad… - I'm okay. I'm okay. Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad… Dad… Dad… Dad, please…. Wake up. - Sweetie… - Dad! - Dad! - Sweetie! Dad! Lien! It's me, Hai! It's really Hai now! My body feels so great. Touch it. It's okay, I'll touch it back home. Dad! Listen to me, sweetie. You can't find out who you really are if you're always trying to be someone else. You have to discover that on your own. Dad, hurry up! We're gonna be late! Dad! Dad, you promised you wouldn't be sad. Relax, even if I were sad, I wouldn't let you see. I'd wait until you take off, then start crying. Dad… Are you alright? Goodbye, Mom. I'm going to school, Mom. Wish me luck. Thank you, dear. Even though our girl's gone, it feels like we're all finally back together.
