Get out of the car! I told you to get out! What's going on? Moving violation. The driver won't get out. Sir, please cooperate and get out of the car. Get out of the car! Get up! Get up! Stand up straight! - Senior. - Get in! Come check this out. Get in. DIVORCE AGREEMENT That guy yesterday swallowed a handful of amphetamines before we caught him. Just died at the hospital. Go get the victim's autopsy report first. That scumbag was actually a teacher. The victim was his student. Height, 130 cm. 130 cm. Chest width, 20 cm. 20 cm. Chest thickness, 12 cm. 12 cm. Left forehead laceration, three by one. Three by one. Senior, I'll go get coffee. I'm here for the autopsy report. The blood analysis isn't done yet. You'll have to wait. Got a light? Thanks. Pineapple cake. Who's so ignorant to send this? Captain Wen, here. You have it. You're not superstitious. You forget we're partners. Do I have options? Ah-Sheng. Ah-Sheng! Chief is asking for you. Wen Tzu-Sheng, this is attorney Chiu. I'll cut to the chase. I know what happened. You kept the suspect cuffed in the car for two hours, delaying his treatment. Now he's dead. His family wants to know the truth, so they've hired me to investigate. We need an explanation. Take a look at this. The victim was nine. More than ten fractures on her body. She was molested, then suffocated with a plastic bag. The body was mutilated after death. - Who will give her family an explanation? - Officer Wen. These are two separate matters. - The law states... - 72 hours. From the time she went missing till found. This animal tortured her for 72 hours. I cuffed him for two hours, so he'll receive treatment after the autopsy is completed. That's my explanation. That's all. Hey, Officer Wen. Hey! SIDE DISH PLATTER What do you think of Hsueh-Ning? What about her? Don't you think she's hot? Do you ever wonder what it would be like to bang a coroner? Ah-Tao. Do you know what this dish is made of? No. Excuse me. What's this made of? Pig's uterus. Uterus? I'm leaving. No need to see me off. You pay. Hsueh-Ning is behind us. - Morning. - Morning. Captain Wen, the body was found here. Judging by the extent of the bloating, time of death was in the last two days. Cause of death? Can't be sure until the autopsy. Reporters are here. We have breaking news. A headless female corpse was found at Riverside Park this morning. Time of death was in the last two days. The head has not yet been found. Police are treating this as a homicide. The victim's identity is currently being investigated. Mechanical asphyxia confirmed. Death by strangulation. The head was severed with a saw post-mortem. Evidence of sexual assault? There's vaginal tearing, but the area has been washed. No residue. The body has bruising in multiple areas. But judging by the state of healing, these are previous injuries. Probably not inflicted when she was killed. Fingertips were burned, so fingerprints couldn't be collected. Hence, the deceased currently remains unidentified. But there are other clues. The victim had breast augmentation surgery. These new implants all have serial numbers. My classmate sells these. I should be able to find out which clinic did the operation. Let's have a meal together? I'm a little tired. I want to go home and rest. Besides, I can't go to restaurants, because I smell like formaldehyde. Hello? Hsueh-Ning? Yes. I found the information. That batch of implants went to the Jun Ming Clinic. It's owned by Kao Chun-Wei. You know Kao Chun-Wei, right? He went to our med school. Today, we have skincare and Botox. - Sure, no problem. - Please come this way. - Thank you. - Thank you. Can I help you? Police investigation. Is the manager here? Please wait. - Abby, someone's asking for you. - Okay. Hi! We're the police. We need some client information. You should have the files. Please wait. Doctor Lin, two cops are asking for client information. They've got official papers. Excuse me. Anesthetic. Found it. She only left the alias "Hsin-yu." And a contact number. Darn it. She used an alias, so people wouldn't know those things are fake, right? Want to ask her yourself? Hello? Hello? I'm looking for Hsin-yu. Who the fuck are you? I've got nothing to do with that bitch. His name is Tu-yong. He's got a record for assault and narcotics. The number we found from the clinic was his. We accessed his call records. A third of his calls were to her. Lin Hsiao-yu. She should be Tu-yong's girlfriend. Her phone is off. Judging by her age, she could be the victim. No criminal record. Household registration down south. Still looking for details. - Ting. - Yes, sir. You've checked the security cameras? Yes, no suspicious vehicles. - Ming is waiting. - Okay. Chairman Tung, long time no see. This is Lily. She lives with Lin Hsiao-yu. This is Officer Wen. He's looking for Hsiao-yu. This is her room. How long have you lived here? About a year. My room's next door. This is her boyfriend? Yeah. But they're on and off. How did they meet? Why don't they live together? Tu-yong worked as a bouncer at the club. Hsiao-yu lived with him for a while. But he's on drugs. He beats her when he has no money. We found Tu-yong. Which room? The drug dealer said No. 603. Want to call for backup, just in case? It's Ting's daughter's birthday today. Did you check your gun? Who are you? Where's Tu-yong? No such person here. Open the door. Shit. Go inside. Squat over there. Hands on your head. Squat down! Who's inside? My girlfriend. Get over there. Stay down! What's so funny? I told you it's my girlfriend. Who said you could move? - Want to cuff them back? - Ah-Tao. Hands on your head! Stand against the wall! Stay down! Screw you! Senior! Don't move! Ah-Tao! He's dead. Put your gun down. Ah-Tao! Colleagues will now pay respects. Please take your positions for the incense offering. Captain Wang Kuo-chiang and colleagues offer their prayers to the late Mr. Chen. Please bow. Second bow. Third bow. Family members return the courtesy. Whose grave is this? WU WEN-HSIN'S GRAVE DIED - APRIL 4, 2010 This was the day... I started dating my college boyfriend. He was my senior. It was really late that night, when he asked me out. He suddenly confessed to me, asking me to be his girlfriend. I said yes. He was the school hotshot. Who could refuse him? The next day, they found a dead woman on school grounds. She was his classmate. Before the cops questioned me, he asked me to make up a story to avoid trouble, by saying we went night viewing at Yangmingshan until late night that day, and that he took me home. Stupid, right? I was a woman in love. Didn't even realize how serious it was. I naively thought we could just go on being happily together. Until one day, I had a nightmare. I can't remember what it was about, but the terror I felt has never been forgotten. Then I suddenly remembered the victim of that murder. I don't know why, but I really wanted to see her. So, I came to her grave, and I found solace. He used you as an alibi. We broke up after I got sick. Why are you telling me this? Wu Wen-hsin's case was never solved. I accessed her autopsy report after I became a coroner. Like Lin Hsiao-yu, she was strangled to death. Her crotch was washed after she was raped. It's been so many years... You think these two cases are linked? I don't know. But I know these two cases are linked to the same person. EYEBAGS AND EYELID SURGERY JUN MING CLINIC Doctor Kao. Let's talk. This way, please. Officer Wen. I saw the news. You guys killed the killer. Yes. But the motive requires further investigation. Did you operate on Lin Hsiao-yu yourself? Yes. Did you have any special impressions of her? Special impressions? What kind of impressions? What do you remember about her? Lin Hsiao-yu's surgery was in the second week of last month. Height, 165 cm. Weight, 45 kg. Age, 21. Pre-op chest measurement, 81 cm, post-op, 90 cm. She had delicate features with perfect proportions. So, I didn't advise any facial enhancements. So she's more perfect after the breast implants. Was the operation a success? We have pre-op and post-op photos. I can find them for you if you want. Sure. You have cameras in your office? To protect the clients and myself. There are a lot of disputes in this industry. Can I get access to your surveillance footage? Sure. If you have a warrant. These artworks are unique. They are imitations of Francis Bacon. Do you like or dislike them? I can't tell what they are. Body without organs. Body without organs? It portrays the spirituality of the body. It's only when our body and spirit meet that we become configured the way we are. My job is, in essence, to change this configuration. Doctor Kao, please prepare for surgery. Excuse me. That's okay. If there's a need, I'll be back. No problem. Let's talk in the car. I aggravated my old injury. Standing hurts my back. Can you still smoke? I'm not an invalid. Why are you asking me about a seven year old case? It's linked to the Riverside case. Didn't the precinct chief say it was solved? So? You want to stir up trouble? Don't drag me down with you. Liu. Yeah? I won't tell anyone. That's why I asked to speak outside. That case was indeed handled by our precinct. The victim's name was Wu, a med student. I was involved in the investigation. - Wu Wen-hsin? - Yes. I want to know why it was never solved. Keep going. We investigated all suspects at the school. No good matches. Plus, we found, at the scene, there were two sets of suspect footprints. We deduced there were two perpetrators. And most likely, not in the school, but outside the school. You know how it is. As we kept inferring, it became like finding a needle in a haystack. Did you know about Lin Hsiao-yu's cosmetic surgery? Yes. Has she ever mentioned Kao Chun-Wei? The owner of the cosmetic clinic. Or anything else about the clinic. No, but there was one thing I forgot to tell you the other day. On Hsiao-yu's last day of work, she left the venue with a client. Do you know the client's name? He's Korean, but I don't remember his name. We were sitting together at the time. He showed Hsiao-yu a photo on his phone, and kept laughing like a dick. It was really gross. Photo? What kind of photo? I had a lot to drink. I didn't see it clearly. But it looked like a painting. Not drinking? I quit drinking two years ago. The case seven years ago may have two perpetrators. Do you remember anyone that looked suspicious around Kao Chun-Wei? No. Have a drink with me. Doctor Kao, we're heading off now. Hello? I want to make an appointment with Doctor Kao next week. Doctor Kao isn't in next week. We can arrange another doctor for you. It's okay, thanks. Okay, thanks. I saw your car outside. Officer Wen, if you want to ask about Lin Hsiao-yu... Wu Wen-hsin. I want to ask about Wu Wen-hsin. Han Hsueh-Ning already told me. Let's talk in my office. Wait a minute. Hello? Tell me the address, I'll head over. He's inside. Passed out drunk. I'm leaving now. Thanks. Hey. Hey! Where's the painting from? Fuck! Who are you? Who are you? Fuck! Where's the painting from? Hello? It's been a while. This is Kao Chun-Wei. Can I meet you alone tomorrow night? SIDE DISH PLATTER Why didn't Officer Chen come today? Come in. You don't have a bed? I just moved in. The good news is... I found a fresh clue. Lin Hsiao-yu's death is linked to an artwork. It was sold by a place called Empty Gallery. I asked Ting to check it out. What's the bad news? Chun-Wei is going overseas next week. It's a one-way ticket. That's not a bad thing. I'm sorry. Can you take me home? Okay. NT$500 for ten hours. Did a guy with long hair just go in? Are you bathing or not? If you are, it's NT$500. Hey. - Is that black car outside yours? - Yeah. Go check on it. It's been smashed. Captain Wen's car is here. I'll go help out. Ah-Sheng. Where's Han Hsueh-Ning? In the car. I'll have a word with her. Get out of the car. Why did you do it? I should have done it long ago. It wasn't for Lin Hsiao-yu, or for Wu Wen-hsin. It was for me. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT He deceived me. I want to start over. If I didn't do it, I couldn't... Truly break free from the past. I was pregnant with Kao Chun-Wei's child. But I miscarried. Ah-Sheng. We're taking her to the precinct. How are Kao Chun-Wei's injuries? Stabbed with a surgical knife. Missed the vital organs. Nothing serious, but it should hurt when he wakes up. Only a coroner could stab this expertly. - It's likely retribution. - Who called it in? Han Hsueh-Ning herself. The security cameras in this room recorded everything. She first knocked out Kao Chun-Wei with a Taser, then stabbed him with a surgical knife. It was premeditated. Wait. What was that? - Rewind it. - Okay. Ah-Cheng, get Fat Cat for me. Captain Wen? Captain Wen. Here's what you asked for. This gallery is low-profile and by reservation only. The artworks are sold on a specific website. Buyers need to pre-register. The registered owner is Hsiao I-ming. He was badly scarred in a fire when he was young. Quite gruesome. I'm in. PAINTING MATERIALS This guy's a real deviant. Lin Hsiao-yu. Stop watching. Notify the prosecutor. Get ready to arrest. - Where are you going? - The hospital. Where's Kao Chun-Wei? I'm looking for him, too. EMPTY GALLERY Hold on. Remember, it's all Han Hsueh-Ning's fault. There has been a major development in the shocking Riverside corpse case. The police have arrested Hsiao I-ming, suspected of multiple sexual assaults, along with his brother, Kao Chun-Wei. Kao was shot dead by police during the attempted arrest. It's reported that Kao was a cosmetic surgeon who ran his own clinic. Police investigations found that he prolonged surgical anesthesia to commit sexual assaults on victims. Estimated victims are as high as 30 people. The police have already shut down the clinic. We'll keep you informed of any new developments in this case. No one seems to be on level 5. Do you want to call and check? Who are you looking for? Level 5. I'm delivering a bed to Mr. Wen. I didn't order a bed. - Are you Mr. Wen? - Yes. It was ordered by Miss Han. How did you kill Lin Hsiao-yu? That's enough. What did you do after killing her? Kao Chun-Wei is dead. I saw the news. He had a younger brother, Kao I-ming. Seven years ago, he changed his surname to Hsiao. He's the one who killed Lin Hsiao-yu. He pleaded guilty. Was Kao Chun-Wei involved? Only Hsiao I-ming was involved. That's why the implant clue was left behind. Two months ago, they raped Lin Hsiao-yu at the clinic. Kao Chun-Wei used video footage of the rapes to inspire his artworks. He set up Empty Gallery with an alias. By curious coincidence, Hsiao-yu's client bought an artwork. Who are you looking for? Your gallery sold this painting, right? I want to know who painted it. He's inside. He killed Hsiao-yu. He also raped and killed Wen-hsin seven years ago. They sedated her, but she suddenly woke up. How about the other victims? All the victims were the clinic's clients. Their identities were verified. Thank you. What for? The bed. This case is hereby closed. As of 2:40 p.m. today, the accused, Han Hsueh-Ning, is sentenced to one year of imprisonment for wounding with intent. Court is adjourned. I think everybody knows that Hsueh-Ning's novel is based on a real case. And that she was a key figure in the case, who had to bear legal responsibility. The novel is very entertaining. Though I had seen the news report about the case, I still find the novel suspenseful and hard to put down. Her descriptions of the killer's psychological state are exquisite. It's a very chilling read, but satisfying and enjoyable. I believe it's because she actually experienced it. Let's now invite Hsueh-Ning to tell us how she felt during the creative process. Hsueh-Ning. Actually, this book talks about my thoughts. The plot might be fictional, but the characters and emotions are real. Officer Wen, I am Kao Chun-Wei's fiancée. I know a novel doesn't need to be completely truthful, but I think there are factual inconsistencies that you as a policeman should know. Tell me more. In the novel, Chun-Wei impregnated the victim. That's impossible. He's not capable of impregnating any woman. If he were healthy, those videos would not exist. Kao Chun-Wei's hard drive contained a video I didn't hand in. Watch it and tell me how to handle it. This is just a novel. I used to be a professional coroner. I faced dead people every day. But the dead cannot speak, so I could only guess what happened when they were alive. I could feel their pain. That's why I turned their stories into a novel. Okay, I'm going to head off first. - Okay, bye. - Bye. Have you read the book? Yes, I did. Sorry. I used your surname for the police character. You portrayed me too well. There's something I've never told anyone. It wasn't an accident. That night, three years ago, I should have been at home, taking care of my daughter. But I secretly went out to go drinking with some mates. I heard someone misfired at your precinct. Is that real? It wasn't a misfire. The gun exploded. A rookie was nearly killed. Poor bastard. You haven't told me what you do for a living. I'm a cop. A detective. You don't look like one. What about now? I slept with a woman I picked up at the bar, even though I knew it was very late. My daughter waited alone at home for me. She must have waited a very long time, and climbed up the balcony when she heard me returning. She fell from the building. Right in front of my eyes. I know it was all because of my selfishness. I can't forgive myself. I kept lying to myself that it was just an accident. I never told anyone the truth. I'm an asshole. I'm not that hero in your novel. No matter what you've been through, you should fight for a chance to start over. DIVORCE AGREEMENT
