EASY SEX, SAD MOVIES This is lovely, isn't it? - Will we hear them? - What? The chimes. I don't know. I've always seen it at home, on the TV. It's gone 11:40 already. Less than 17 minutes to go, we can see it on the clock that our cameras are showing us from the mobile unit down in the square. - Once again, the square is packed... - It's incredible! GALAXY STORES WISHES YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS - I'm leaving. - What? - I'm sorry, I have to go. - Victor. Victor! The last scene of a romantic comedy is always the easiest to write. A great declaration of love in which the two protagonists manage to overcome all the obstacles and decide to be together forever. Then comes the kiss, logically. That's essential. The start of the story isn't too complicated either: in a bookstore like those that always appear in romantic comedies. Marina and Victor could meet in that place. In any romantic comedy, the hero always has a friend, fatter or shyer than he is, in whom he confides. - You're not helping me. - Yes, I am. What I'm not doing is fuelling the drama. God, I'd really love some new friends. The heroine must have a friend too, someone who always has very difficult love affairs and seems unable to talk about anything else. The thing doesn't last more than 5 or 7 minutes. Amazing! Suddenly he does this to me... A signal for me to go! And it wouldn't be unusual that in a romantic comedy the protagonists' friends end up falling in love... and their wedding could be the perfect excuse for Victor and Marina to meet again after being apart for a while. Those are the essential moments in the story. Now... I just have to write it. Your teeth will fall out if you brush like that. Scalp massage? Why not use the helmet I gave you? Are you having a shower? - You could've got up earlier. - Oh, please... Well, hurry up. I was throwing up all night. I feel awful. I'm not pregnant, don't worry. It must have been that shit we ate last night. Why didn't you tell me? What for? I don't know, I've got no idea. I lost it. Did you call the camera guys? Don't tell him you're calling for me, I owe him a fortune. OK, love, a big kiss. I don't know where I left mine. - "Love"? Who was that? - Didn't I tell you? She's worked with me for ages. Don't come crying to me afterwards. I know you. - Or have an eighth child... - No, the ninth. Claudita, the one I had with the Brazilian girl. I lived in Madrid for ages. I know the city, how they talk, everything. Don't worry about that. - Do you hear me? - Yes, yes. It has to be light-hearted, people don't want to be depressed. And the city has to look like Paris, New York... Wait! - Here. - Thanks. This is the advance. Any time now I'll give you the rest. - "Any time now"? - Are you hard up? No, but "without a fish, the seal doesn't clap", Andr√©s. - Don't you like what I gave you? - Yes, it's fine. It's work. - Are you writing anything? - Something. Maybe you'll finish it some day. Come on, don't get annoyed. And stop worrying about money because a guy wants to bring a group to buy the production company. He's Turkish. He's not going to get involved, or... - do anything. - That's good. - Have you got Spanish citizenship? - No. - Why not? - They never gave it to me. It has to be a co-production. We have to contract Argentinean actors, - Spanish actors... - That's fine. For the Argentinians, we can talk to Daniel and to Peretti. The Spanish love them. - When will you finish the script? - Any time now. As soon as you can, hurry up. It's a romantic comedy. It shouldn't be hard. INTERIOR. BOOKSTORE. DAY Valeria! Valeria! - Can't you stop? - No, I can't. Don't you see? Carry on. Use a gentler touch. It's 15 minutes over the hour. - I teach a kids' dance class. - That's neat. Yeah, but I'm hoping for something better. Of course. - What do you do? - Web sites. - I'm a designer. - That's great! All day in front of a computer. A bit of a pain, but it's not bad. - My car's over there. - I live near here, I can walk. - But we can have one more. - I have to dance tomorrow. - You have my number, right? - Yes, but, not even one more? One can't harm you. Yeah, but not tonight. That's because you don't know me. I'm Victor Montero, 32 years old. At 5, I broke this finger and bent it forever. My brother sells cars in Germany. My parents live in Barcelona. Every Sunday they eat paella. They like it. You know what I like? Gin and tonic. Another thing we have in common. If you want to know anything else about me, you'll find out later. What a pity. You were doing really well. Yes, you're a dickhead. It's no big deal. I was pleasant, but it didn't work. It's OK. You can't force relationships. You know why? One day you get up and, somehow, you have a girlfriend. At first, we get on really well. We screw every day, we try weird positions. We do it in the park, the supermarket. The usual. After 6 months, one says: "Why pay two rents?" "Why pay more? Let's live together." And you fall for it. A year later, your girlfriend has become your roommate. You're dying to screw, yes. With everyone except her. You don't want to hear her problems, she complicates your life... - Stop, stop. - You hang on another six months. Then you separate and you've lost 18 months. For forcing things. Why are you so scared to fall in love? - I'm not scared. - Do you know what I'd give to... Shit, and as well, with a dancer. Look, call her. That way, you see her at least once more. We'll go see her dance one day. Maybe she has a friend for me. We might fall in love. If I have kids with her best friend my kids will play with yours. We'd collect them from school. - Yeah, sure. - In my Audi. On Sundays you'd all come to our house. Well, I've got your essays. Weak, guys, eh? Anyone who didn't read the classics is just lazy. Well, a few are good. Who is... - Camila...? - Kander? Me. - Hello. - I was delighted about the essay. - It's very good. - I'm so proud that you say that. In High School, I always read Pablo Diuk's columns. My friends and I would wait for Fridays to read them. They were great. Why did you stop? It was a supplement for young people... Right. And I loved your novel. It really affected me. The characters, the dialogue... Are you writing now? You haven't published in ages. - Yes, various things. - That's good. Different things in different areas. A movie script too. That's really good. Well, it's more of an assignment. I'm doing a favor for a friend, a producer. - Well... - Well... At least you'll be able to change your car. Yes. Where are you going? - To Colegiales. - If you want... It's on my way. It is? Great. - I studied cinema too. - Excuse me, Cristina, put on... Camila. Actually, I studied a load of other things too, but... I gave them all up. And I'm going to give this one up too, I want to live abroad and do other things. I might make a movie first. - That's good. - Yes, next year. I want to show the life of the super in my building. A guy who sits there quietly watching people passing by, hurrying, coming and going... Everyone is so busy and he is just sitting there, quietly, as if he were a buddha. Yes, yes, like a totem. Yes, something like that. Well... Well... Let me make you some tea. I don't take coffee, It gives me a headache. Come on, and you can sign your novel for me. You still have it? I told you I'm a big fan. Your class was exhausting. I love them, but... - Yes, intense. - Yes. I'm dying for a joint. Will you roll it? I'm peeing myself. You want to watch? Fuck, this is paradise. Just as well I insisted you come. You were on the phone the whole time. It was just for a minute. It's full of hot girls and faggots. We're going to get interested in dancing. We'll get a season ticket or whatever. We'll come more often. I really liked the one who did the splits. Yeah? You know what you can do with a girl like that? A lot of things. Don't laugh, I fall in love over silly things. - I know, for your lifetime. - For my lifetime. - Victor. - Hello. This is a surprise - How are you? - Fine, and you? Great. Well... I loved it. - You did? - Seriously. When you danced, it was as if... you were kind of floating. And then, I don't really understand this... You moved a hand or a foot and I felt all sorts of things. Really, you're incredible, I mean it. That's great. It knocked me out a bit. Thank you. Hi! - Hello. - This is Luis, he's a friend of mine. - You were great. - Thank you. - We're going for a beer. - OK. This is Victor... Hello. - And you're... - Luis. I've just set up your fan club. - Thank you. - I'm serious. Well, I'm Clara. - What'll we do? Let's... - We're going for a beer. Want to come? - Sure. - That's great. - Did you tell the others? - Yes. What tonic do you have? OK, let the ice cubes chill it. Then take those out and put in fresh ones. One quarter of gin, three of tonic. What ice cubes do you have? OK, two of those. What do you want? I'll have the same. If the tonic is cold from the start, it has no taste. And with more than three ice cubes, it's too watery. All right. And one question: after you have 4 or 5, do you still notice all that? I never drink more than two. Five points. Four. He forgot to remove the lemon pips. How are you? - Very well, and you? - I'm well. I'm... half dating someone. Best to clarify things now, isn't it? Yes, of course. It's much better. We can... I don't really believe in friendship in these cases. I think... it doesn't work. I agree. I don't know why I said it. Something we have in common. I loved "Flashdance" when I was a kid. - What? - I learned all the choreography. As soon as any neighbors or relatives came to the house, I'd put a band on my hair and start dancing. And I wasn't bad. I think I'd have been a great dancer, but... - my parents didn't support me. - That's adorable! - You could start dancing again. - I haven't ruled it out. Taxi! I think I'm leaving now. Hey, weren't you and I going the same way? - Yes! We'll talk. - OK. Your poor friend. - No, your poor friend. - No, no, your poor friend. How long has it been? With that guy. A week, six days. Six days? Yes. I see things or I don't see them, And with him... I saw it. Don't you imagine things? Yes, at times, but in general I prefer living in reality. I don't, I need to imagine things. How can you always live in reality, without imagining anything? Do you ever surprise anyone with anything? Sometimes. Sometimes I do imagine. I'm going that way. OK. But we'll talk, OK? Victor. Thanks for coming. OK, but when do they kiss? That'll take a while, Andr√©s. It can't be so easy, so... immediate. Really? Well, you know best. What are you taking? Are you all right? Yes, I'll tell you now. I take it because after the second whiskey my pressure goes up. 170, 180. This brings it down a bit. They changed the medication. I was taking one and I never came. I was screwing and screwing and I never came. So your girlfriend's happy. You don't know all I do to keep in shape, so I can be with someone young. And I still get a hard on. - I don't use Viagra, they forbade it. - Without it. Yes. You want another? Wait a minute, Andr√©s. Are you sure you can? Look, 130-80. I'm fighting fit. And the truth is, I know that everything is up here. I'm not well. - What's wrong? - Adriana. I feel that she's not committed to the relationship. She's not... - I see. - She's... not there... I feel that she's always uncertain and that makes me... - She's never really... - She's not... and that makes me... - It makes me sad. - Yeah. It's unbelievable. - What's so funny, asshole? - This always happens to you. It's the same speech, word for word, almost with the same commas I need to be loved, looked after. Yeah, right. How are you and Valeria? Good, we're good. It's a good moment. A lovely moment. What are you doing here? I didn't have a class, The university was closed, there was a strike... about I don't know what. Can you turn that off, please? What'll we do? I don't know, I'm stuck right now. Yes, I know. It's a bit harder than I expected. Have a bit of patience. Give me a fucking break, Andr√©s. Nothing, nothing. I don't feel like talking now. I'll tell you later. I don't know, a week or so. I don't know how long I'll take. And pay me the rest of the fucking advance. No. They didn't send me anything. How? What? Nothing like this has ever happened to me. What happened? You know what she said to me last week? That what she liked most about me was my big cock. But she's obsessed about it. - But that's not so bad. - I don't know how to use it. And she's right. - If I'm not comfortable... - What? I come very quickly. Fuck. I told her I was starting to feel something for her and she comes out with that. She asked why I don't start seeing other girls, she doesn't mind. She wants to start screwing other guys. She even said she wanted to do a "gangbang". - You know what a "gangbang" is? - What is it? Could I have two, please? Your problem is you're obsessed with what you feel. Enjoy your freedom, look at me. Marina didn't work out. Do I stay at home? No, I'm ready for anything. Look, no one wants to be alone. Neither do you. Look at me. I'm good fun. - I'm not Brad Pitt. - No. - I'm likable. - Yes. - I'm not the typical gym guy. - No, for sure. - I have an attribute that is... - Spectacular, I know. Yet all I want is a girl who has fun with me and loves me. You realize? What's wrong? I start talking about this and I get upset. I want to go home. There are things I have to do. It's 5:00 a.m., what are you going to do? It's very late. I've got lots to do. Finish your beer. Relax, don't go. No, I'm going. I have things to do. Excuse me, do you know where Calle de la Reina is? I think it's that way, but I'm not sure. - Thanks, I've just arrived here. - I see. Welcome. Yes? - Marina? - Yes. You're right. I'm predictable. Very. At times I'm so predictable I bore myself. It's normal that you'd think: "He'll never surprise me". - You hear me? - Yes, yes. I want to invite you to breakfast. - But what time is it? - I don't know. Let me bring you breakfast in bed and then, if you want, I'll leave. And another thing. don't comb your hair, OK? Don't shower, or brush your teeth, or anything. I'd like to see how you are in the morning. - Fuck. - What? You're really pretty. - Come in. - I'm serious. Is someone here? Yes, come on, I'll introduce you. - Gustavo, Victor. Victor, Gustavo. - Hello, Gustavo. - Don't worry, he doesn't like anyone. - Really? I'm the same. So, is he the man of your life, or what happened? Yeah, kind of. You smell great. Yeah. I doubt it. Yesterday I was so tired after rehearsal I didn't shower. - Even better, I love it. - What a pig. - Coffee? - Yes. Blue, red? Blue. I'll tell you the plan. We have breakfast now, we tell each other a bit about ourselves. You can shower if you want, or not. You know I like it. - Have you anything to do later? - No, not much. Good, we're going to the beach. - To the beach? - Yes, it's 7:00 a.m. Do you drive? - Yes. - Good. - Do you like the beach when it's cold? - I love it. Even better. If we survive our first day together we'll spend the night there, but without forcing things. If we spend the night there and get on well, I think we can start thinking about a life together. - Admit I've surprised you. - You have. Has it ever happened to you that you look at people and imagine how they'll be when they're old. - No, not a lot. - No? - I left a guy for that. - Really? I met his father, and then I looked at him and I saw that man of seventy. It was horrible. Really, it was my paranoia that killed us. I hope you never meet my father. He's completely bald. No, you'll be a very attractive grandfather. Maybe a bit bald. Around here. - Seriously? - Yes. You never know with hair. One day it just falls out. - Yes. - You know what I do? - What? - My weird fixation? I've never told anyone this. I imagine geometric figures with syllables. For example: "Hi, how are you?" That's a square. Hi-how-are-you, four syllables. Seriously. I'm really imaginative. Yes, and that was really personal. It's not bad. I notice something like... the bubbles. And... But it's a gin and tonic, right? - Like any gin and tonic? - No, no! This gin and tonic is... different. - Fuck it. - It's... The difference is in the tiny details. Some day you'll understand. - Can you see the details? - Yes. I'm looking and I can't find them. I love this song. Don't make me dance, I can't dance. Yes, come on, just a bit. Everyone has seen me. Good morning. Good morning. Shall we live here, in this room, forever? Something to eat, a few movies... All day in bed. Tell me it'll always be like this. Just say yes. I promise. - Hello. - Hello. How about a kiss? Am I distracting you? Stop, stop. Unsettling you? - What? - We're going to crash. - Hello. - My love. Talk dirty to me. Look, I know that... at the end, the situation was really blocked, things were complicated. - We both really screwed up. - I know. But I was also thinking about lots of beautiful things that we did, moments... I don't know. These days I couldn't stop producing images of us. Like the first time we went to the beach, remember? Do you remember? Well, and... And also the things that could have happened. Yes, but they didn't happen. - It's not like that. - Well... It's not that the girl is this way and the boy is that way. Then one day both realize they have to change, they marry and live happily ever after. It's not like that. One day, I'm one way, the next day, I'm another. - One day I love you... - Fluctuating... Yes, one day I can't stand you, the next, I think you're great. One day I know what I want, another day, I don't. It's confusing. It's not like those stories you write. It's a matter of statistics: the days you get on well, the days you don't. And we, statistically, get on like shit. What part won't you understand? If there's anything I could've done so we don't end like this... I don't know. And we should have had kids. That's what people do. We'd stop thinking about us and focus on something else. - You didn't want kids. - But if we'd had them, this... - No, wait... - I don't know why you rang me. - I was feeling better. - So we could talk. Sit down, don't make a fuss. What's wrong? Do you feel alone now? Is that it? Why not think before you talk? In romantic comedies, the couples are happy, at least when everything is going right for them. A moment when, if the movie ended there, we'd feel they'd be happy for the rest of their lives. Forever, for all of eternity. Hey, one thing. What? Are you sure about what we're doing? No. But you gave up your apartment, so we've got no choice. With no crisis, no problems, financial, sexual, family or otherwise. - Darling, I love them. - Really? They're wonderful. You can't find them anymore. There are no arguments, no conflicts, no infidelity, no illnesses... Absolute understanding and total union. And, just to emphasize how well they get on, how much in love they can be, their friends are always in a mess. she felt too young for such a serious, stable relationship. She wanted to be with other people she wasn't sure about her feelings, blah blah. - Yeah, but how are you? - To be honest, I want to die, You're not serious! I only have the strength to watch series, any shit will do. I sit at home all day. - See what I left you the other day? - Yeah, I couldn't get into it. The sixth season is the good one, have a bit of patience. OK. I mean, it's not... The sixth is good. I liked the supporting actors. The stupid brother, who did this... The one with glasses? He dies. Fuck, the one I thought was funny. Third episode, second season. The way he talks, he must be sick. - No, he's run over by a truck. - Fuck. He leaves the court, kaput. They're all very happy. It's a romantic comedy, asshole. You want me to kill the mother? So, they're together now, And things are good, and... what's going to happen? You'll see at the end. Something will happen. - All right, then... - Yes, yes. Cheer up, I'm going to pay you. I'm working hard to sell the production company and I rang you because I need you to do me a favor. No, no, don't worry, It's nothing odd, it's just... Remember the Turk I told you about? He met some French people who are going to put in money, a small production company, it all adds up, and that's where you come in. The idea is that you write something, something that happens there. In France? Every romantic comedy has got Paris in it. - But... - Just a little scene, something stupid... You can easily do it, you're so talented. Look, look, look... Before you go, check out that girl. Every time you come, she asks about you. She's Adriana, my girlfriend. I told you about her. - Didn't I? I told you. She... - What are you trying to say? She just suggested that we could say to Valeria that the four of us could spend a day at my house or at an hotel... - Are you crazy? - It was her idea. Shall we try it? No, I've left Valeria. It's all over. - You didn't say anything... - Yeah, well... - How are you? - I'm fine... Fine? Well, you're a writer and writers are odd, they're people who can be alone. My apartment is always there for you. I'd die before I shut myself in an apartment with you. Listen to me, talk to Valeria, mention the idea to her. Maybe she'll accept - and things will work out. - Son of a bitch! Don't touch me! - To Paris? - Yes. But, why? Aren't you happy here with me? Of course, but it's an incredible opportunity. It's one of the best companies in the world. - But what do I do? - You come with me. Rehearsals finish at midday. Then we can explore the city, visit museums, you can learn French, get another job... - And give up my job here? - You always complain about it. Yeah, but it's not that bad. But you could get something better. You like designing. What's here? A magazine with cars and girls. All day removing stretch marks with Photoshop. - And it could close any time. - That's not definite. Let's go, Victor. Let's go! I need this. Being a dancer here is like being a bullfighter in Japan. Come on. You wanted to live abroad some day, learn a language. You wanted to edit a music magazine. This is the time. If not now, when? True. Promise you'll think about it. I promise. I'll think it over. - You hear me? - Yes. And you've got nothing to say? What do you want me to say? Something. Did you like it or not? You saw the rehearsal. We open in 3 days. Of course I liked it. It's very good. - I don't know what else you want. - You don't know... Don't keep on, don't pressure me. I'm not a dancer. - What's wrong with you? - Nothing. What's wrong with you? Have you thought about Paris? Yes, but I'm still not certain. It isn't an easy decision. Fuck it, Victor. Pablo. Luc√≠a! What are you...? No! What are you doing here? I can't believe it, after all this time... You're still the same. - Yes. - It's been so long... - Are you still in Montevideo? - Yes. - It's lovely, peaceful... - That's good. But I still come here, - looking for the noise in Buenos Aires. - A bit of chaos. Chaos, yes. - I thought you were in Spain. - No, I was, for quite some time, but I came back a while ago. And you buy your own books? Yes... Well, They're things that... - we writers do. - We can't help it. - Inevitable. - No! I don't believe it! I found it in a bookstore near here. - Shall we swap? - Yes, how could we not? - Are you writing? - Well... - Something. - Something? It's not coming out. Some things are, but it's not... They're stages. It happens, don't worry. And if it doesn't, come visit me in Montevideo. Yes? All right. - Tell me about yourself. - What do you want to know? - Did you get married? - No. Did you have children? No. Well, I was with someone until... until a few months ago. And, well, maybe we'll sort it out. We talk on the phone. I separated too. Three years ago. Couples are complicated. They're complicated, yes. What's up, man? - I don't... - Do you remember me? You're the first person I spoke to when I arrived in Madrid. I remember you very well, I asked you about a street. Remember? - I'm Camila. - Victor. Pleased to meet you. - What are you doing? - Coming out of work. That's great. Spring in Madrid is incredible. I love it. Everything is kind of exultant, I don't know, exotic. I feel... It's fantastic. - What are you doing here? - Directing a play - that I wrote... - Careful. I had some ideas but I didn't really know where they were going. A lecturer said: "Write it down". He insisted and, I swear, he saved my life. - That's good. - Yes, it is. - What's it about? - A girl who falls in love with the super of her building, and he with her. It's very intense, he leaves his family, his job, - and they go off traveling. - They go off. Yes, it's a love story with autobiographical touches. Not everything, but some things. It's not all autobiographical, but a bit. It's great. I thought it was no use, and now it seems... We're going on tour to Paris, Rome... - Really? - Yes, it's great. Canada... I can stop working as a waitress. What are you doing now? I was going home. I won't be opening for another hour. You want to come in? - Well... - Well... This... I'm staying a few more days here in Buenos Aires. If you want to... - All right. - There's time... And if not, in Montevideo. - All right. - What? - Where is it? - It's here. We'll talk? OK. Thanks. - For the book, I mean! - Oh, same here. Wait, one more thing. You can't open my book until you finish writing what you're writing. - All right. - It might help you... - Yes? - OK. - It's a deal? - It's a deal. Ciao. Hi, this is Valeria. Leave your message. Fucking say something! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. And she's stupid, because she's stupid. Did you see what she wrote? She's stupid! You son of a bitch! - Who else do you write to? - No, no... Who? I'm fine. I'm sure we'll get over this, I guess. You know what the problem is? We haven't been able to find a solution. As human beings, I mean. - Mind the shit. - Christ! For everything else, yes. but not for this. You don't like your partner? Separate. You like people of your own sex? Get married. But for sex in a couple, there's no good solution. Some married people spend their lives wanting to screw someone else. Do they screw? No. They repress it and suffer. Others do it. Yippee, let's screw! But they have to cheat, lie, hide to do it, and they suffer too. Others say: "I don't want to cheat, I'll tell my partner". So they have group sex. And that must be neat at first. But one day, they see the other and start suffering like hell. There's no good solution. - Are you listening? - Yes, there's no good solution. - Why should there be a solution? - Give me the water. Just because... Can you simplify everything in your life? I can't. Maybe we should separate for a while to see what we feel. You still don't know what you feel? Yes, but distance helps you see things more clearly. You're a dickhead, I told you already. You'll screw with two, three, twenty, whatever, but you'll end up on your own again, in the shit. You'll be sorry, you'll see. Right, If they get over the first crisis, - if they can carry on. - That's it. - We're at that point. - They're both doing OK. - Do you want anything, love? - No. Mom will be here any minute. Now, tell me... Answer that. - No, go on. - Answer it. I'll call her later, don't worry. - What did you say? - I'll call her later. - "Her"? - Luc√≠a. - Remember? - You talked a lot about Luc√≠a. - You did nothing with her. - She had a boyfriend. After that, we didn't coincide. We met by chance the other day and ended up at my place. - She lives in Montevideo. - How long is she staying? For a week, I think. Call her. Don't be... What's wrong with you? - I've got other things on my mind. - Listen to me, call her. I'm thinking about things... Valeria is still there. - You and Valeria are finished. - Stop. Remember the excuses you gave for leaving her. Stop. - Or all the lovers that... - That's enough. That's lovely! There's mom. We'll put this away. A big kiss for uncle Pablo. - Ciao, Pablo. - Ciao. Well... Big hug. Here. And tell mom that I'll give her the money soon. OK. - Ciao, dad. - Ciao, sweetheart. Getting back to... Have they made up or not? Are they going to France? I've got no idea. I don't like goodbyes, You know that. I'll be back in six months, I think. Look after the cat and the apartment. In almost all romantic comedies there's a moment when the couple separate. Taxi! At times it's a trip one of them has to make or, for some reason, given the imminent arrival of solitude each has to consider what's happened to date and what they want to happen from now on. See if the love that worked for a period of time was something that, after a while, can be forgotten as easily as it sprang it up. Or not. Thanks. Maybe they have to realize they're made for each other. Forever. Lucas is away on a trip, so don't worry. - Lucas? - Yes. Didn't you know? Yes, I knew something, but I didn't... Then you didn't know this either. I wanted to show you because I'm not inviting you. We're not that modern. Cheer up! - Have you gone mad? - Why? You? You're getting married? Yes. He proposed and I thought it would be fun. Come on, have fun with me! It's over, it's finished. Come on! Are you sure about this? No. But I told him yes so I can't back out. Let's be friends. Let's not hate each other. And we have to celebrate it, don't we? I think... You and I? I don't know. You want to fuck. - Why do you say "fuck"? - What? Have you got sensitive? Do I have to say "make love"? Do you prefer that? - Well... - Well... - Good luck and all that. - Thank you. - I love you very much. - Me too. - How are you? - Fine. - And you? - Great, really good. That's nice. I took my stuff out of the apartment. Yeah, thanks. I'm moving out too. It's senseless keeping it on. And thanks for looking after the cat. I missed him. That's OK. I'd give this one three points, right? It's a gin and tonic. - I'm going out to smoke. Coming? - You're smoking again? Just so as to fuck up all the French. A nonagon. Count: Just-so-as... - When do you leave? - In two weeks. I'm here for Christmas and then... What are you up to? You were right. The magazine closed and I lost my job. - I'm sorry. - No, it worked out well. I got a good settlement and I used it to start - that magazine I talked about. - Yes? It's got a section called "How to be a bullfighter in Japan". - It's a dance section. - Really? That's great! We started on Internet and we might move on to paper. But I don't care. I'm designing my own things. I'm happy, I don't spend the day removing stretch marks. - I'm delighted. - So am I. Listen, forgive me. You and I haven't had much luck, have we? Maybe if you were here, or I was there, whichever, it would be different. But like this... I didn't want to change your life, or change mine either. Right. So... We'll talk before you leave, won't we? Yes, of course. Ciao. No... You're completely crazy. I didn't want to worry you. Did you believe I had a new office? Come on, sit down. I didn't lie to you, I do have an office. - Quite nice, isn't it? - Are you OK? I'm getting out in two days. I know, you're going to tell me it's my own fault... I know all you're going to say, but it's not that. Adriana left me. What happened? We did a swap with the Turk and they fell in love. The guy left his wife. You're a moron, Andr√©s. Yes, but every cloud has a silver lining. The guy bought the production company, all the movies He bought everything, so I'll have money again. - And I can pay you for the script. - At last! And I told him that our financial agreement was double what I'd told you, so you'll get a hell of check. - No! You're a genius. - Yes. - You're a genius. - We can toast if you like. With what? Saline solution? I don't believe it! We're going to drink to life. We're going to drink to the script. It's almost finished. It seems I'm finally finishing something I write. Congratulations. Now what are you going to do? Rest. Spend time with my children, my grandchildren... You have to look after the people you love, you know? What about you? I want to keep writing, finish some of the novels. Now that I'll have money, it'll be easier. And? The other is harder for me than for you. I don't fall in love so easily. - So I can call her now, can't I? - Call who? Valeria. - She's gorgeous. - I'm going to unplug you. Hello! What a lovely surprise! - Hi, dad. - Hello, sweetheart. - Careful, I can't get up. - Hi, grandpa, what happened you? - Nothing, darling. - What happened you? Nothing... Something silly. Don't worry, everything's fine. And so that is where... you can think of the writer as... someone who is mid-way between life... and his work. Well, I've got the essays. Weak, guys, eh? Anyone who didn't read the classics is just lazy. All romantic comedies always end with a great declaration of love. And with a kiss. I said that was essential. What comes after, fortunately, we can't know. We only know what happened before. What those characters had to go through to become who they are now and forever. Because the characters, after that ending, can't change anymore. They will remain unalterable in the best moment of their lives. Just before the moment when the real problems should begin and when movies would start to seem too much like life. Full of conflicts that can't be solved, of doubts, of deaths, of illnesses, of lies, of deceit... And I don't want movies to seem like life. At least, not for now. - I'm leaving. - What? - I'm sorry, I have to go. - Victor! What do you want? I want to be with you today. This year, and all the ones coming afterwards too, because, whatever comes, I want to do it with you. And if I have to change my life, I'll do it. I don't care. And if you have to change yours a bit too, do it. But we'll be together, agreed? Wherever. There'll be other women in my life and probably other men in yours, better looking ones. But this is like gin and tonic: The importance is in the details. And I like your details. The smell of your sweaty clothes when you've been dancing. How you imagine a different life very day. I like listening to you tell me things, even though I don't really understand what you're saying. I like that you imagine how you'll be in 60 years and that you imagine how I'll be. And I love your gin and tonic, the passion with which you make them. Because I want that passion in my life. And the things I don't like about you are like... the lemon pips that you spit out and the gin and tonic is still good. When you discover that you love someone, you can't waste time. And I don't want to waste time, I want to look after you. THE END For Pablo: for everything that is in these pages, which are also partly yours. Translation: Lindsay Moxham Subtitles: LASERFILM
