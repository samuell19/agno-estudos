'What stands between the ordinary public and this outbreak of crime? 'What protection has the man in the street against this armed threat to his life? 'At the Old Bailey Mr Justice Finnemore, 'in passing sentence for a crime of robbery with violence, 'gave this plain answer.' (Judge) 'This is perhaps another illustration of the disaster 'caused by insufficient numbers of police. 'I have no doubt that one of the best preventives of crime 'is the regular uniformed police officer on the beat.' (Narrator) 'Veterans like George Dixon with 25 years' service, 'now Police Constable 693 attached to Paddington Green.' Excuse me. Can you direct me to Paddington Station? Yes, sir. Straight across the green, left over the iron bridge and you're there. Thank you very much. 'And young men like Andy Mitchell who has just completed his training.' - Kid's lost, doesn't even know his name. - No? Now look, Monty Green, try this on again and you'll get into trouble. Go on, get off home. He knows he gets a jam bun every time he's taken to the station. Saucy little devil. That's one thing they couldn't teach you at Peel House. I suppose not. It won't be the only thing either. You can bet your beat boots on that. - Isn't that one of our CID fellas? - Yes, Jock Campbell. Come on, son. Move on. You ought to know better than that. Buy a barrow and see the world. Ripe cherries! Cherries, all ripe! (Drunken singing) Fourpence bronze, glasses, three cigarettes, season ticket to the Temple, one teaspoon marked LMS. Edward Alexander Wainwright. That's me. Edward Alexander Wainwright, you're charged with being guilty of disorderly behaviour at Spring Street, Paddington, at 6:40pm on 2 July 1949, contrary to the Licensing Act of 1872, Section 12. Stewed rhubarb. When charged, prisoner made no reply. Evening, Jim. Evening, Fred. - Game of lines? - Yeah, I don't mind if I do. Well, I'd better go and make up my log books. Shuffle 'em up. - Come on, sit down. - Thank you. - How's it going? - Not at all bad. I'm finding my way around the manor. That's something. First time I went out, I had to get a drunken Irishman to direct me back to the station. Look, chummy, don't take this wrong, now. You're new and you can't be expected to know everything. But when you meet any of us CID chaps in the street, just don't show you know us, see? If we happen to be watching a suspect... - I'm sorry. I should have known better. - Och, it's just one of these things. - Where are you from? - Maidstone in Kent. What made you go and change that for the Edgware Road, then? I don't know, really. I don't know either. Hyde Park's all right, very nice indeed. But no mountains. I miss the mountains, man. Hey, who's pinched my baked beans? Send for a copper. Taff's been robbed. A chap can't leave a thing for two minutes without somebody knocking it off. - Here they are, Taff. - Oh, sorry, Lucy. And you haven't paid for them yet. - Living in the section house? - No, they're full. I'm in digs. - Are they OK? - A bit crummy. (Singing in Welsh) Oh, for heaven's sake, Taff! The choir ought to sing that, only you infidels can't talk Welsh. Can't we have any peace? What with drunks and choir rehearsals! - 12 beat. - And sergeants. 12 beat? That's me. - Anyone else round that way? - I'm on ten, sarge. You'd best take this on, Dixon. 7, Westlow Buildings. - Alf Lewis again, eh? - Yes, his wife sent round. - Go with him, Mitchell. - Yes, sergeant. All right, boy, don't rush it. This is a regular customer. He don't kill his old woman off too quick as a rule. Give them a bow. They've all been waiting to see you. Take your hands off me. - Van's on its way. - Stay and take particulars from his wife. Now, move along, please. Move along. - All right, guv'nor. - Boy copper! (Sobbing) I'll kill him one of these days. What seems to be the trouble, madam? I tells him I'm going to set the police after our daughter, Diana. She's the eldest. She left home two nights ago. Well, um... May I have her full name, please? - (Kids all shout at once) - Oh, shut up! Can't you see I'm busy? Marlene, take them out of here. And get that baby out. And bring his wind up. - You can see I've got my hands full. - I want her back, mister. Yes, quite. Well, may I have her full name and a detailed description, please? - I've got a photo of her. - Yes, but I... It's ever such a pretty one. Took it down at Clacton last summer. (Narrator) 'The case of Diana Lewis is typical of many: 'a young girl showing the effects 'of a childhood spent in a home broken and demoralised by war. 'These restless youngsters have produced a type of delinquent 'which is partly responsible for the post-war increase in crime. 'Some are content with pilfering and petty theft. 'Others with more bravado graduate to serious offences. 'Youths with brain enough to plan and organise criminal adventures 'and yet who lack the code, experience and discipline of the professional thief 'which sets them as a class apart, 'all the more dangerous because of their immaturity.' 'Young men such as these two present a new problem to the police, 'men as yet without records, 'for natural cunning and a ruthless use of violence 'has so far kept them out of trouble. 'The small circle which represents the underworld does not accept them 'and they are avoided by the regular criminals, 'for they are a liability even to their associates.' We got the place eyed. Looks like the right stuff. - I don't want to know. - You don't have to do nothing. We only want someone to help us get rid of the gear. What happens if you get done? You little layabouts is all the same. You'd scream your heads off. Then the bogies get onto me. Stick to gas meters, sonny. Where you been? I've been waiting hours for you. Two teas. I seen Maisie, Tom, Jordan's bit. Jordan's going to her place tomorrow. You didn't tell her anything? Of course not. What do you think I am? Soft or something? Yeah. Tomorrow? What's the use? We ain't ready yet. Why not? If Randall's windy, we can do it ourselves. He ain't the only one. As soon as we got the stuff they'll fall over themselves to handle it. - Mary Bertha Lewis. - No, that's the mother. - The girl's Diana Lewis. - All right, I got it. (Knocking) Here, see what chummy wants. - Right, sergeant. - 709, short report, skip. - Alleged cruelty to a horse. - Right. 849, sarge. - (Knocking continues) - What do you want? How long is it before a fella can get a cup of tea? - I'll see what I can do. - Not too strong and two lumps. - How do. Any customers? - One drunk, one assault. - The drunk wants some tea. - (Knocking) Woodpecker, eh? I'll deal with him. Well, that seems all right. We'll get the women police to make the necessary inquiries. Right, you're off. - Good night. - Good night. - That smells good. - Canadian bacon from Elsie's parcel. Enough for an extra one? Now, George, don't tell me you've asked someone again without telling me. I did sort of mention we had that parcel. - Who to? - Young Mitchell. - I told you about him. - Oh, George. I'm not got up for meeting strangers. He won't look at you once he gets a load of that. He's on a starvation diet at his lodgings. Well, why can't he find somewhere else? Well, rooms aren't so easy to come by these days. Very few folks with a room going begging. Bert's old room? Well, why not? No, George. It's bad enough having one policeman without having to do for another. - Be company for you. - I'm set in my ways now. Besides, I don't want strangers clumping up and down the stairs, - spilling ash on the carpet. - It's one lad and he don't smoke. No, George. It's only six months before you retire. Then we have to move out. It wouldn't be worth it. Well, I want to talk to you about that. The chief's been asking if there's any chance of me stopping on. - What did you tell him? - Well, I said I'd think it over. How do you feel about it, Em? I don't know. Five more years of it? No, dear. You've earned your rest. - (Knock at door) - That's him. Come on in, Andy. Give us your hat. - Found your way all right? - Yeah. - Have any trouble with Lewis? - Who? Oh, him! No. - Andy, meet the missus. - How do. - Pleased to meet you. - Make yourself at home. Don't just stand there, George. Fetch me another knife and fork. Come and sit down. How do you like being a policeman? Mustn't grumble. If you're a real copper, you'll never stop. Leastways, George hasn't for the last 20 years. Now, come on, ma. Get a move on. I want to water my begonias before midnight. Here, don't you move me on. I'm not one of your barrow boys. Now, you tuck into that. - What about the washing up? - All done. Andy gave me a hand with it. - I bet that makes you feel different. - I liked him from the start. It will be nice having a boy round the place again. I thought you'd think that way once you'd met him. No more than a kid, really. How old is he, George? 25. Same age Bert would have been. Just about. Oh, well. ♪ Oh, it's my delight on a Friday night ♪ In the season of the year ♪ Yes, it's my delight on a Friday night ♪ In the season of the year (Coughing) You came in a bar too early, George. If you watched my hand instead of looking up, you wouldn't do it. - I was watching. I'm sorry, Taff. - Put him on the report. Come on, the canaries. Let's hear from you. - Nymphs and Shepherds. - (Tuning fork pings) (All tune their voices) Sh, sh, sh, sh. One, two, three, four. ♪ Nymphs and shepherds come away - ♪ Come away - ♪ Nymphs and shepherds - ♪ Come away - ♪ Come, come, come... No. There's a death rattle in that back row. I don't know who's doing it but it doesn't sound very nice. I think it's me. I've got a frog in my throat. If I was you, I'd let the frog do the singing. - (Laughter) - One, two, three, four. Fall in, the night duty. No respect for music or anything else with their old parades. Same time tomorrow night, boys. (Girl giggling) Oi. - All correct, sarge. - All right, Taff. - Nice night. - Aye, it is. - All correct, sarge. - Another nice night for your stars. Aye, Venus is moving into her third phase. Oh, is she? Good night. Good night, sarge. (Squealing) (Squealing continues) - Any trouble. - No, dead easy. - Where did you get it? - Up the Dilly. How long has Jordan been there? Long enough. Scared? Who, me? Let's go. Know where you're going, Andy? Hello, George. You gave me a start. Getting you down, eh, this night lark? Bores me stiff. You want something to think about. - And miss a good job that comes along? - You won't. Soon as you've been on a few nights, you find one part of your mind keeps on the alert automatic, like. And the rest of it? Well, take old nutty Cox, 689 He tries to find out ways of beating the football pool. Wal Tovey studies the stars. Wish I could think of something to think about. - What do you think about? - Me? Oh, I just make up little verses about the job. - Do you? - Like this "all correct" business. They cracked a safe at number eight They've robbed the local bank The kids have smashed the fire alarm It's just their jolly prank You've found a headless torso and it's foul play you suspect... Here's the funny bit. But when the sergeant comes along you must tell him, "All correct" Oh, when the sergeant comes along you must tell him... All correct, sergeant. - All correct. - What do you mean, "all correct"? Standing here gossiping like old women. You're supposed to be on your own. How long do you want to be wet-nursed? - Go on, break it up. - Very good, sergeant. Next time you'll both be writing a 728. Looks as if we'll have a drop more rain. Do my geraniums a bit of good. I hear you're not stopping on with us. I'd like to, but it wouldn't be fair on the missus. (Woman screams) Help! Help! (Screaming) Fred! Police! Police! What is it, madam? - He's dead. It's murder. - Oh, dear. He hit him on the head. There were two of them. Fred! Oh, thank goodness. - (Crying) - Pull yourself together. - Are you all right, sir? - What? Oh, yes, officer, it's nothing. It's... Oh, Maisie, for goodness sake! There's no need to shout the place down. No, no, officer. Don't phone. It's quite all right. - This line's been cut. - There's a phone in my flat. Thank you, Mr Williams. It's quite all right. Just a minute, sir. Oh! My pearls! They've taken my pearls. - Quick, get on the blower. - Shut up! It's my flat. I'm the one that's been robbed. I'll use this gentleman's phone. No, no, officer. I've got my reputation to think of. - I've dialed 999. - Thank you, madam. Who asked you to interfere? Get out of here! She's only trying to help. (All shout at once) Now, now, now. What's all this about? I dialed 999. (All shout at once) That's better. Now, all you good people get off to bed. We'll take care of this, thank you. All right. Good night, officer. - I dialed 999. - Thank you very much, lady. Now, one at a time, please. They've taken my pearls. - They weren't valuable. - What? They were cultured pearls, not worth making a fuss about. But... but you told me that... Yes, yes, I know but I exaggerated. You dirty, filthy old liar! Oh, shut up! Now, look, Maisie, I think we could all do with a nice cup of tea. How about it, eh? Cultured! Now, sir, let's have this from the start. First, your full name. Um... Frederick Richard Evans. Now look, Mr Jordan, I know you. I've been a long time round this part. (Buzzing) That's the wireless car. Let 'em in, Andy. Righto, George. Frederick Jordan, isn't it? Frederick Percival Jordan. We'll do our best not to make things embarrassing. We all slip up occasionally. Now, as to what really happened... There were two of them. One of them had a cosh. He said, "You pipe down or you'll get a load of this." - All right, Dixon? - Yes, sarge. Creeper job. Got disturbed and used violence. - What's missing? - String of pearls. - Value? - Couple of pounds. - A couple of... - Anything else? My keys. They've gone. The keys to my shop. Jordan's the jewellers, Edgware Road. All clear. Hey! - He seen us. - Nah, he didn't have time. (Tyres screeching) It's Taff Hughes. - Are you all right, Taff? - Come on, get him inside. Get him a chair. Grant, find the lights. - Come on, Taff. - Thank you. - Well, Brooks? - All correct, sir. - Too late, eh? - Afraid so, sir. - Mugs' job. - Hm. - Are you all right? - Not too bad, sir. - Get a look at them? - No, sir. He managed to grab this belt. - Get him along to Dr Forbes. - Righto. Come on, mate. - Did you see them, 814? - No, sir. They'd gone when I arrived. You'd better get back on your beat. Oh, very good, sergeant. You'll get used to it. CID gets all the fun. Fun? Right, off you go. This is Mr Jordan, sergeant. I'm afraid he's had a bit of a disturbed night. Oh, dear! - Oh, dear! - All right, Dixon. Still here, Andy? - Did you hear about Taffy Hughes? - Charlie's just told me. - He got badly done up down here. - He's got a good hard head. - Need one on this job. - But... You'd better get back on your beat, son. I've got to ring in. So long. So long, George. 693 Dixon returning to five beat. No, we just missed them. Oh, you think so, eh? You ought to talk, sitting there all night on your... (Scoffs) (Clock chiming) I got the job, start tomorrow. - You didn't give your right name? - Called myself Daphne Morris. Tom, that copper. - What about him? - He's watching you. Act natural. Excuse me. - Are you talking to me? - I'd like a word with the young lady. - Me? - Is your name Diana Lewis? - No, it's not. - What's the trouble? The young lady's been reported missing. - Your mother's worried, Miss Lewis. - That's not my name, I tell you. - May I see your identity card, please? - No, you can't. Then you'd better come with me to the station. Station? I ain't done nothing. Just a little talk. We won't keep you long. Go on, do as he asks. I'll join you later. I ain't walking with you. I don't want all my friends to see me. All right, I'll walk along behind. Paddington Green. You know the way. (George) You last saw him two days ago? No, Thursday. Or was it Friday? Er, what age is the dog, madam? Five... no, six months. Wait a minute, though. Let me see. We had him at the children's party because he was afraid of the crackers. He'd be about three weeks, then, I suppose. Well, have you got a licence for him? You need one if he's six months. Well, no, as a matter of fact I haven't. I've been meaning to but I wasn't quite sure whether... We'd better make him five months, hadn't we? Perhaps it would be as well. - And the name, please? - Waterbourne, W-A... I see, and did he say anything? Nothing she could repeat. Very well. I'll have his description circulated. - Thank you very much. - Come on, Penelope. Yes, Mitchell? I have reason to believe this young lady has run away. - He believes wrong. - Take her out to the women police. Very good, sergeant. This way, please. Treating me like a convict! Does he answer to any name? Baloo. He'll come to anyone. He's very intelligent. "Answers to the name of Baloo." B-A-L double O. Kipling, you know. Of course, the original Baloo was a bear. My husband said it was wrong calling him Baloo. He wanted him called Mischief because he grabbed our Sunday joint. You ought to call him Strachey. Yes. Don't send me back home, miss. Please don't send me back. I'd sooner kill myself than live there again. I won't do it, I won't go! All right. I can't send you home if you don't want to go. - You can't? - Not now you're 17. - Why didn't you tell me that before? - Now, listen. Suppose I try and get you a job and put you onto a hostel where you can live with girls your own age? A hostel? Next thing I know I'll be in the Band of Hope. - And I've got a job, thank you very much. - Where? - That's my affair. - Well, if you won't be helped. - I won't. - Anything I should tell your mother? Ask her whether she likes doing a bit of work herself for a change. All right, constable. Show this young lady out. - Thank you for nothing. - This way, please. When I'm ready. - Hiya, Smoocher. How's business? - Mustn't grumble. - DDI in? - Yes, sergeant. Now this forefinger. Come on, hurry it up. That compact from the Jordan robbery, could I have a look at it, sir? The things people expect us to believe! - Are you onto something? - One of the men just brought a girl in. - Yes. She was using a compact like this. - Who had her in? - PC Mitchell. - (Phone rings) I'd better see him. DDI. Tucker? Keep him waiting for a bit. - See if PC Mitchell's still here. - Very good, sarge. He might have gone back on his beat, sir. Unless we've produced a new breed, he'll be in the canteen. - Do you think there's anything in it? - I've given up guessing. There was a time when I acted on hunches. They retarded my promotion by about five years. Here, catch. Thank you, sir. - Wish I had your strength of mind. - Wait till you've got three kids. - (Knock at door) - Come in. Who's this girl you brought in? Diana Lewis. She'd run away from home. Do you know what she does, who she goes around with? There was a man with her when I picked her up. - There was, eh? - Yes, sir. Roberts, give him the album, just on the off-chance. Have a look through this. You'll find most local celebrities in it. See if you can spot this man. - Very good, sir. - Right, off you go. Roberts, phone the labs, see if they got anything from that belt. - Right, sir. - And send Tucker in. All right, Sophie, in you go. On the night of the 15th I was down in Brighton. You can verify that from Alec Ward at the Angel. I went there with his brother Charlie what had a dog in the second race. Made myself a nice little crust too. You know better, Mr Roberts. That Jordan job doesn't carry my autograph. You're suffering, Charlie. Couldn't really call it a job, could you? Call it what you like. Who did it? Fine as a lady's breath. I couldn't tell you. Small fry. Local lads, I'd say. Very untidy. Double the pink. Ah, you're losing your touch, Mike. I'm sorry, Mr Roberts. - I'd tell you if I could, but... - Oh, sure. Do you a bit of good, though. Royal Lady, fourth race tomorrow, White City. - Worth a bit, is she? - I'm having 100 on her. Well, I'll risk a dollar. Thanks, Mike. - Turn it up, Spud. - Yeah, but I... There's nothing to worry about. I've told you. OK. Give us that knife, come on. You didn't tell that blue bag where you was working? What do you think I am? Soft or something? Yeah. Hey, Spud. How much ammo did you get? Ten rounds. - That all? - You planning to start a war? Yeah. You want to take it easy. These things ain't pea shooters. Ah, shut up, Spud. Why don't you blow? - Did she get the dope from the cinema? - Who, Di? Yeah. Yeah, well, how long is she going to be in with us? - Why? - It ain't safe, that's why. One silly crack out of that little cow and they can put us all inside. You leave her to me. Give me the ammo. And now blow. Where's Spud gone? I thought you were going to... Come here, Di. Where did you get that? Bought it. What for? I said come here, Di. You see? When you got one of these in your hands, people listen to you. Don't, Tom. It makes me nervous. That's what I mean. That's what it's for. No, Tom, I don't like it. Tom, please, it might go off. It doesn't make a lot of noise. No, Tom, don't. Tom! Scare easy, don't you? - What do you want to frighten me for? - So that you remember what I tell you. When we get there, act like you've never seen us. And afterwards, keep your mouth shut. You don't know nothing. You understand? Yes. You thought I was going to do you in. - No, I didn't. - Oh, yes, you did. What was you yelling for? Feel your ticker. You don't trust me, do you? I don't know. - That's the way I like it. - That your idea of a good time? - Frightening the life out of people? - A bit of a scare's good for your insides. Do you ever get scared? Yeah, course I do. It's a... Well, it's a kind of excitement. You mean, you like it? Makes you think quicker. You're all keyed up and then... afterwards you feel terrific, like you... (Train passing) You got to lime-wash on both sides. I got that tip from Ginger Bourne last time I knocked him off. Here you are, Taff. Sit down, all of you. Everyone take milk? Taff reckons my begonias are good enough for Chelsea. So they should be, the time you spend on them. - What compost are you using, George? - Ah, compost. Now you've put your finger right on it. That's the secret, mixing your manures right. George! We're having our tea. I reckon the best proportion is three parts cow manure. - The best product of Kent. - I was that ashamed. Andy takes us down for the day to see his folks in Kent and what do you think George does, if you please? Goes out into the field with a little cardboard box. I was that ashamed I'll never be able to show my face there again. - Ooh, those look good. - You've found a soft number here. Aye, do yourself all right here, I can see. Yes, but they've no heart. No sooner settle in and they kick you out. - You can't blame us for that. - Certainly I blame you. What's that? If George wasn't so lazy we could stay five years. - See here, Andy... - That's a fine thing to say! Look, it's about time you two got wise to each other. George, ma doesn't want you to retire. She's breaking her heart at the idea of moving out. - I really must ask you... - George is the same, ma. He's only thinking of you. He hates the idea of turning his job in. Is that true? - Well, I... - Quite so. He's just been telling us. Well, why couldn't you tell me that? Haven't you got a tongue in your head? You might have wagged yours. You know how to most times. Here, here, here, here, here! Cup of tea, please. - Did you get it? - Yeah. OK. Let's check your end. Big picture comes on at half past nine. The manager goes to the office. Cashier starts making out the money. How long before she takes it to the office? - About 20 minutes. - OK. Give us the programme. Half past nine. Number eight. Tessie O'Shea. - Second turn after the interval. - She's on for 25 minutes. 25 minutes. Ah, we could do it in half the time. No, we need the extra in case you're unlucky with a car. Don't worry, I won't be. Now, then, George. Show them what you can do, boy. 16. - Seven. - Take it easy, George. Don't let them get you rattled, boy. I knew you'd do it!

Hello all cars from M2GW. 'Message number 92 from information room begins. 'Harrow Road, Coliseum Cinema. 'Two men in grey Nash, DXD 931 .' (Message coming through) - George Dixon shot. - What? DDI.

Yes, go on, go on. ♪ Oh, I want a little bit of love ♪ I've never been this way before ♪ And I've had my picture taken in a bathing suit ♪ Cos I'm looking for a lad ♪ Any kind of lad ♪ Looking for a lad once more - Got our drinks? - Sure. Now, pull yourself together. - Have one yourself. - Ta. I'll have a gin. You've done it this time. This time you've really done it. I didn't kill him. I was shooting at his legs. Let's hope it was his legs. (Cheering and applause) Nearly an hour since they started. It won't be much longer, ma. Thought you might like a cup of tea. We're just having one. Thank you. They're very kind, you know. I remember when I was a kid in a hospital in Maidstone... He stood it very well, Mrs Dixon. A fine constitution. And he's going to be all right? I'll answer that when we've got him off the danger list. Please, may I see him? Well, just for a moment. He's not conscious again yet, mind you. Doctor, what... He's got a 50-50 chance. Oh, George. (Men chatting) I think that's the best thing to do, don't you,? I think so, sir. Goodbye, Cherry. Are you going back to Paddington Green? - Yes, unless... - I think that's best. By the time we've seen those witnesses we should know the result. They're at work on the car now. Unless we get some extra help, it's going to be difficult. Well, you'll have to get cracking now. Got any other outstanding jobs? Robbery with violence, sir. Jordan's jeweler's. I've got Roberts working on it. - Any prints? - Plenty. Far too many for my liking. Keep moving. Move along there, please. All right, now take that back wall over there. Right. Six, eight. Now take from the wall to the feet. Twelve, nine. - You've never seen this man before? - Not that I know of. I don't look at their faces, only their money. Quite. Well, that's all. Thank you for coming. And don't talk about this more than you can help, will you? Oh, you can trust me. I shan't say a word to anyone. - Not much she won't! - Cigarette? - No, I'm trying to cut them out. - I wish I could. - Carry on. I'll ring the hospital again. - Very good, sir. - Oh, excuse me, sir. - That's quite all right. - About that Jordan job, sir. - Well? This mackintosh was supplied by H. Barker and Sons, Manchester. Nice work. Get a list of the shops they supply in this area. - I've got Manchester working on it. - Good. - Will one of you come in? - Go on, in you go. No, you first. - Go on! - No, you. Don't keep the gentleman waiting. - (Girl) I'll follow you. - Oh, well, you'd better come in together. Bow Street? Paddington Green here. I've got the answer to your bail enquiry. Ready? What do you do with all your pencils? St Mary's Hospital on the line, sir. This is Detective Superintendent Harwood. Can you give me the latest news on PC Dixon, please? You'll have to wait now. Yes. Yes. I see. Of course. Thank you. Condition's a little better. That's as far as they'll go. I shall be in my office for the next half hour. - Right, sir. - Hello? All right, DP to ED. Eh? Yes, he's a little better, mate. Hello. PC 814 Mitchell, five beat, ringing in. That you, Taffy? What's the news? He is? Oh, good. Bye. Hey, tosh! How's that copper doing? - Holding his own. - Good for him, not as I've got much use for coppers, but I don't hold with having them shot. That's very decent of you. Come on, keep moving. Look what Queenie's got. Look out, coppers! - Are you hiding something? - No. - Let me see. - No. - What have you got behind your back? - Nothing. - Where did you get this? - Nowhere. - Did you find it? - No. What's your name? - You've got a name, haven't you? - No. - Her name's Queenie Edwards, mister. - (All) Shut up! Big mouth! Queenie, we've been looking for this, I think. I want you to come and tell us where you found it. - No. - (All chant) He's going to lock her up! Hey, mister, leave her alone. She ain't done nothing. - (All chant) He's going to lock her up! - Get moving. He's going to lock her up! I happened to turn round and there he was, gun in hand... I turned before you did. I saw him first. - Oh, no, you didn't. - Oh, yes, I did. That point isn't of vast importance. - I turned round the minute I noticed... - Always has to contradict! Me contradict? That's good. Right, you two. I shan't keep you any longer. Thank you for coming along. You know the way out. - No, I don't. - Oh, yes, you do. - I tell you I don't. - You do. Stop pushing me. Sorry. Report's come through about the car used on the Dixon case. - No prints, of course. - Only the owner's. Yes, it was too much to expect. (Phone rings) DDI. Oh, yes, sir? Oh, I see. Yes, of course, sir. This is a murder case. Come on in. Don't be frightened. Any CID in? I've picked up something. - You'd better go through. - Come on. (Phone rings) Station officer. Oh, hello, Bill. Yeah, that's right, that's the one. Yeah, no rear light. OK. Yes, it's a rotten business. - Yes, madam? - I've lost my little girl's ration book. Name, please, madam. (Knock at door) Come in. - What is it, Mitchell? - I want to report the finding of this. - Where did you get this? - I saw a child with it. I've got her outside now. - Could be the one. - It's the right type. - Good work, Mitchell. - Thank you, sir. - Roberts, get this along to the lab. - Right, sir. (Phone rings) DDI. Yes, he's here now. Right, I'll send him along. Mitchell, the Chief Inspector wants to see you at once. Very good, sir. (Knock at door) Come in. Oh, come in, Mitchell. Stand easy. I'm afraid I've got rather an unpleasant job for you. Yes, sir? You lodge at PC Dixon's house. Yes, that's quite right, sir. You've heard the news of course. No, sir. You mean, there's... been a change, sir? Dixon died 20 minutes ago. Died? I want you to break the news to his wife. I'm going round there myself but I think it'd be kinder if it came from a friend. Yes, sir. Then you'll do it? Yes, sir. We'll go right away. I shouldn't like her to hear the news from anyone else. No, sir. Andy, you're early. I'm just off to St Mary's. I want these to be the first thing he sets eyes on when he comes round. Oh, Mr Hammond, I... He's dead. It was all of a sudden, Mrs Dixon. His heart. They had no time to get through to you. No, sir. There couldn't have been any pain, the doctor said. I'd better put these in water. We'll get him, ma, whoever did it. We'll get him. I expect you will. She only seems to know one word. Queenie, do you like sweets? No. What, not even chocolate? No. - Are you sure? - Here, put that away. Can't have you bribing a witness. Oh, well, you've done it now. You mean, you don't like that stuff? No. Don't you say anything except no? No. Why not, Queenie? - My dad says I mustn't talk to coppers. - He doesn't like policemen, eh? - My dad says all coppers... - All right, we know. Let's forget what he said for a minute, shall we? Look, Queenie, we think you can help us. Do you know what a murderer is? Someone what gets hung? That's it. We think you can help us to catch one. We want you to show us where you found that revolver. Will you take us there? We'll give you a nice ride in the car, Queenie. Will you come? Here. I caught it fishing. - Good girl, Queenie. - Roberts, you'd better get to work. Ring up Thames Division, have them drag the canal. It's a long shot but something might turn up. Will you be able to hang him now? We'll see, Queenie. We'll see. All right, the copper's dead. So what? They was down at the cinema today. I don't want to go back. They haven't asked you questions? They don't know your real name? - No, but... - Then stay there! - I can't. - You'll do what I tell you! Take it easy, Tom. Maybe she's right. - Who asked your opinion? - The bogies will get onto her. She ain't fit to be left on her own. She's only a kid. Yeah? And what's it to you? Well, just look at her. If she loses her head, we're all for it. I think she ought to lie low for a bit. Where? Your place? - That the idea? - Have you gone crazy or something? We got enough trouble without you dreaming up more. I don't want your girl. - No? - No, you're nuts. I'm thinking of my own neck, that's all. (Sobbing) All right, I'll keep her here. - And now blow. - OK. See you later. Stay away from him. - Tom, I never... - I never said you did. Hey! Remember any bag-snatching jobs? Not off-hand, sergeant. This mackintosh was stuffed up the chimney in a bombed-out house. Neither of them had coats according to the witnesses. Dump it. And hang onto this for the time being. Just a minute, sergeant. That mac used in the Jordan job. - Who supplied it? - H. Barker and Sons, Manchester. Why? Well, what do you know! Follow this up, Campbell. Take it round to all the shops on that list. - See if you can trace it. - OK. Just had a report on the gun. It's the one they used all right. - Any luck? - No, sir. We've got a lead on the Jordan job. Campbell's following it up now. You know about the funeral, two o'clock tomorrow? Yes, I've been warned. They're at their best just now. I'll, erm... I'll take 'em with me, ma. (Organ music playing) I'm sorry, chum. I can't help you. Uh-huh. - There it is. Thanks all the same. - That's all right. - Hello, Andy? - Any luck? Not a sausage. How do all these places keep going? 1 1 shops in this street alone. They're all selling Barker's raincoats. Still, nearly at the end now. (Brakes squeal) I'll be seeing you. - Have you read the Highway Code? - Certainly. Then you know to pull up at crossings. - I did pull up. - Not soon enough. May I see your driving licence? Haven't you anything better to do? One of your own men shot down in cold blood and all you do is waste your time pestering innocent, respectable people. I'm not surprised all these murderers get away with it. I'm just warning you to drive more carefully in future. Thank you. Here it is. Alfred Lewis. 7, Westlow Buildings. Thanks, mate. Mind if I use your telephone? (Phone rings) DDI. Yes, Campbell? You have? Good. 7, Westlow Buildings. Right, get along there now and wait for Sergeant Roberts. Campbell's found the owner of the mackintosh. Yes, guv'nor. It's my old nanny all right. Where did you find it? We'll ask the questions. How did you come to lose it? My girl Diana loaned it to a boy of hers what brought her home one night. - What's his name? - Couldn't tell you. Know the names of any of her boyfriends? - Couldn't tell you one. - All right, well, that's all for now. Wait a minute. Don't I get my coat back? - You'll have to wait a bit. - Here, not so fast. It's my property, ain't it? I got a right to know. You'll have to find that girl now. There's a photo in the missing persons file. What is it? What's the matter? - Police are out looking for you. - (Gasps) What does it mean? Tom! Does it mean they know? I don't know. Tom, give me some money. I got to get away. I never done nothing. - I never knew you was going to... - Shut up! (Sobbing) (Train passing) (Still sobbing) What are you going to do? I'm going to put us in the clear. That's what. (Knock at door) (Diana) Spud! Spud! Spud! Spud! Oh, Spud, you got to help me. - You've got to! You've got to! - Where's Tom? - I don't know. He's gone. - Gone where? - The police, he said. - What for? - I don't know. I don't know. - He's out of his mind. - Spud, you got to help me! - You stupid cow. Why'd you come here? Don't you know every bogie in the town is out looking for you. I see. Thanks. Sergeant, there's a man here called Riley, Tom Riley. Says he's a friend of Diana Lewis. Well, bring him in. This way, please. Well, come in, Mr Riley. I'm Detective Sergeant Roberts. Sit down. Ta. Well, what can we do for you, eh? I thought you might be looking for me. Oh? What about? The shooting of that copper. I see. - Did you do it? - Me? Catch me coming here if I had? Cigarette? Ta. Ta. - What is it, Campbell? - Sir. The man next door, we thought he'd come in over the Jordan job. He started giving the lead on the Dixon murder. - He did, eh? - Uh-huh. No, you can't pin that job on me. I was up at the Met the night they did it. I was just coming out after the second house and I hear a bloke say they'd shot a copper up at the Coliseum. And? Well, you can check at the Met. Ask the barmaid, Doris. She'll know me. - So you're a friend of Diana Lewis? - Yeah, that's what I've come about. I happened to hear one of your blokes was looking for her. Well, I... I used my loaf, see? I said to myself, "They know she works at the Coliseum and now they want her. "They must reckon she's working in with the bloke what did it, right?" Go on. I've been around a bit with Diana so it just struck me that you might think I was the bloke she was working in with. And you weren't? Come off it, guv'nor. I've just told you. Did Diana ever lend you a raincoat? - A raincoat? - Belonging to her father. Yeah. As a matter of fact, she did. - I took her home and it came on to rain. - What happened to it? I had it pinched. Where from? The Lord Nelson. I went in there one night for some grub before the theatre. Come to think of it, it was the same night I went to the Met. We have that raincoat here. You have? And the belt that was taken from it the night the Jordan shop was robbed. I lost it before then. You said just now you lost it the night PC Dixon was shot. Yeah, I was wrong. That was another one. I'm putting you up for identification in connection with the robbery at the premises of Frederick Jordan, 928 Edgware road, on the night of 14 July. Excuse me, sir. We're putting a man up for identification. - I wonder if you'd mind helping us. - Oh, yes? Identification parade? Oh, righto, I'd love to. Excuse me, sir. We're putting up a man for identification. I wonder if you'd help us. I'm rather late. I hope it won't take long. Excuse me. We're putting a man up for identification. - I wonder if you'd mind helping us. - Me? Why? - You happen to be the type. - Oh, am I? - No funny business? - No, you'll be all right, sir. No, I couldn't swear to any of them. I see. All right, thank you, sir. - Thanks. - Next. - Jordan's girlfriend. - Yes, they'll all look the same to her. Still, we may be lucky. - Oh, she's passed him. - No, she's going back. The silly so and so has picked up one of the men off the street. Thank you, miss. That'll do. - But I... - Don't worry. This happens now and again. We won't lock you up just yet. Right, that's all, thank you, gentlemen. - Well? - Neither Jordan nor the girl picked him. And CRO have no record of him. We haven't got enough evidence for the Jordan job and we certainly can't prove he killed Dixon. - We'll have to let him go. Pity. - Maybe it's not such a pity. - Well, gents, satisfied? - Yes, sorry it was necessary. - Seeing you once owned that raincoat... - Say no more about it. So long, inspector. - Keep after him. - Very good. Have someone ready to relieve Campbell. - I want Riley tailed day and night. - Right, sir. Di? Di? Di, where are you? (Train passing) Di! Di. (Kids shouting) (Barrow boy) I'll buy any old rags. Old rags and lumber! Old rags and lumber! - So you are here. - Tom, I can explain. You thought I was for it. Well, you're wrong. I'm in the clear. Get this packed and hurry up about it. No! I'm not going with you again, never. - I couldn't! I couldn't! - Why not? I'm scared. - Yeah? - It ain't Spud, I swear. It's just... Oh, give me some money, Tom. I got to get away. I'm scared. Oh! You're dangerous. Oh, no! No! Tom, wait! Tom, please! Tom! - You're under arrest. - You've got nothing on me. Murder, that's what you've got on him. - Murder! - Shut up! He shot that copper. He was the one. He killed him. Tom Riley killed him. (Wailing) (Campbell) Hey, Mitchell! Get the wireless car, quick. Come in. Door's open. Who is it? - May I use your phone? It's urgent. - Yes, it's there. What's happened? Oh, did Mummy get the soap in his poor little eyesie? - There! - Police, Scotland Yard. Bizzy! Get into him! Over there, Jock Campbell, look after him. (Siren ringing) Turn left, a red Buick. Hello M2GW from 5D for David. Urgent message for you. '5D over.' Hello 5D from M2GW. Go ahead.
