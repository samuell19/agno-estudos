What was that? We're out in the woods. It's probably just a woodsy animal. It sounded a little scary to me. Oh come on, you're not spooked by what that guy at the gas station said, are you? "People go up there to camp don't come down." That guys has to come down off of tequila. Sarah, we're om the Mexican jungle. Not Transylvania. Besides, Eric and Lori, they came up here and they had a great time and so will we. "People go up there to camp don't come down." They had a great time and we will too. Now start having fun. Roll over. Roll over? Sounds like your idea of a good time. Si. What? That sounded really close. Where are you going? Look, it's probably just a hungry coyote. I'm gonna go find some food, throw it to him and it'll eat and leave. That doesn't really sound like such a good idea. Relax. Her little doggy. Got some bologna for you. All right, that's all you're getting. Go away and be a nice little doggy. Jack? Jack? Jack? Jack, where are you? I hope you don't think this is funny. Jack? Jack? Get out here! This isn't funny! I'm getting pissed! Stop! Sarah, it's me. It's Jack. Asshole! Where the hell did you go? After I threw the food out I had to take a dump. I just wanted to make sure I was out of smelling range. You shit! Yes I did. Not funny. Sarah. It was just a joke. Look, I love you sweetie. Yes I do. You know it. Besides, you don't wanna waste this. This is very expensive vodka. It's got real silver flakes in it. I was saving it for tonight. I don't like to be scared, Jack. Do you forgive me? You sorry? I'm sorry. I don't believe you. Why not? Jack! Jack! Wild animal! Yeah, I know, you do that to me baby. No! Jack, behind you! Wild animal! Jack! Jack? Wake up. Don't die on me, Jack! Jack! Get help. What do I do? Cellphone. My pocket. Shit! Jack, it doesn't work! What do I do? Go. Get help. I can't leave you here. Go get help. I can't leave you here with that thing! I'll be okay. Go. Jack! Jack! Oh my God! What do I do? Jack?! Jack! Jack! Jack! Oh yeah. Oh, that's good, my lolita. You still owe me for that tequila. Where you going? It's laced with opium. You want any more favors, you're gonna do what I want. You know I'm innocent. They totally planted those drugs on me. I didn't have them. Oh yeah, you're all innocent, aren't you? What the? Where am I? Who are you? Why am I tied up? Where's Jack? Where is Jack?! Stop your silly crying! Or I'll have to ball-gag you. Which I may do anyway. If the feeling strikes me. Who are you? Rita. But for you, it's Mistress Rita. Where am I? You are in the Great Republic of Canpuna. In a state prison for the criminally insane. Insane? I'm not crazy. Really? Do you expect the judge to believe your story? Werewolves do no exist, Miss Ragdoll. It's Ragdale. Well maybe I'll just call you Rag for short. I don't believe this is happening. I'm an American citizen. You can't treat me like this. I want to see someone in charge! As you wish. But first, I must inspect you for diseases. Let's take a look at your little American cootchy. Stop! Stop it! Get off me! Get off me you damn, filthy dyke! I give a clean bill of health, my little Rag. Now, we can see the warden of this great facility. Rita, is that any way to treat our new American friend? She would not shut up. Remove the ball gag. Do I have to? Si. This one will make us a lot of money, huh, Rita? Yep. She sure will. You bastard! Miss Ragdale, do you know why you're here? You bastards think I killed Jack. I told you, I'm innocent. Oh yes, that's right. A werewolf killed your boyfriend. I know it sounds crazy, but it's true. Some kind of creature attacked us. Look at my shoulder. When we found you, dogs were eating what you left of your boyfriend and they were about to eat you when we arrived. It's nothing more than a bite from a dog. I want a lawyer. Oh. What's so funny? I want a lawyer. You have to let me speak to a lawyer. I have rights. Oh, Miss Ragdale, you're not in America. Then I want to make a phone call! I do no think you understand the severity of your situation. We found drugs in your tent. Your boyfriend was torn to pieces and scattered all over the camp ground. You're being held in a woman's prison for the criminally insane. You are a danger to society. Oh my God! This isn't happening. There must be an embassy. Oh yes, the American embassy has been notified of your situation and I'm sure they will do whatever they can for you. When they get around to it. Then how about some fucking clothes?! Now I want my phone call. Here's the direct line to your precious American Embassy. Please, help yourself, gringo. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello?! Oh, so sorry. My American se√±orita. We've been having mucho problemas with that phone. We'll have that phone fixed. In the meantime, Rita, here, will make sure your needs are fulfilled. You can't do this! I'm an American citizen! I have rights! You know, you may be here for a very long time. Some of our girls have certain benefits. Life here is much easier for them and it can be for you too. Or it can be hard. Personally, I would prefer if you make it hard. Very hard. Face front. Hold it up. Turn to the side. Take your shirt off and pick the change off the floor. What kind of prison photos are these? It's for a website. Fuck you! That's it, my little gringo. Look at the camera. That's it. Now, look sad and heartbroken, but sexy. Stick your tits out. Press them towards the camera. Come on, baby. Do you expect the judge to believe your story? Werewolves do not exist, Ragdoll. Your boyfriend, dogs were eating off of him. It's nothing more than a bite from a dog! Your boyfriend.. Scattered... You're being held in a woman's prison for the criminally insane. Here. Drink this. What is it? It's tequila. Trust me, you'll need it. Ugh. Didn't say it was good tequila. My name's Rachel. Sarah. So, Sarah, what brings you into this fine establishment? They think I killed my boyfriend. Well did you? No. There was... Oh, I don't know anymore. I thought there was... I remember fighting some kind of animal. Have some more tequila. Ugh. You know what mamma wants. Turn. Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh, Rita, that's it. Oh. Oh yeah. Oh, oh. Oh, yeah. Oh. Oh, that's it. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh. Oh Rita, you're the best. What is she doing? Angel's probably low on cigarettes. So she lets Rita feel her up and Rita gives her cigarettes. That's awful. It's better than being felt up and no cigarettes. Lolita, yeah. Every time I want a cigarette I get fucked. Seems like a lot of work for some cigarettes. You should see what we gotta do to get a chocolate bar. Or a tampon. The tequila? Don't even ask. How long have you been here? Four months and some. What did you... I mean, what did they say you did? Blew up a building and, oops, all of a sudden my handbag was full of cocaine. I was there taking pictures. They planted the drugs. What about the American Embassy? The building, you see, I blew up was the American Embassy. I think I need another drink. Lights out, mamacitas. Hey, Angel. You look like you just got finger fucked, huh? The new fresh little pussy. You know, if you are nice to Garcia, Garcia will be very nice to you. Isn't that right, mamacita? Dog bite, my ass. Hey, pumpkin head. Relax, Sarah. It's just me, Jack. Can't be. Well, a little worse from wear and tear, but yes, it is I. Well. Oh well, a lot worse. I told you it was a stupid idea to come to Canpuna. Can we not talk about bad vacation plans right now? Besides, we have a more pressing issue at hand. We don't have to talk about anything because you don't exist. I'm dreaming. Ow. Sarah, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Yeah? I'm stuck in prison and you're dead. I'm afraid it gets much worse than that. You see, we were attacked by a werewolf. It was just a wild animal. You know that's not true. I don't know what to believe. You know it was a werewolf and the one thing, the only thing, that can kill a werewolf is silver. Fortunately, the werewolf died from the silver flakes that were in the vodka, well, you know, catching on fire and falling off a cliff didn't help either. But you see, Sarah, a werewolf is not just a creature. It's a curse. And this curse has been passed on to you. To me? What're you talking about? You sound like a bad movie or something. Tomorrow night the moon turns full again and you will become a werewolf. You're gonna be like Hannibal Lecter, just without the cooking part. I'm not going to eat people. Yes you will. No I won't. Will too. Will not! Sarah, look at your shoulder. Surely you've noticed. No normal person heals that fast. That's only the beginning. You're gonna become exactly like that creature you killed. What am I gonna do? Get a sliver blade and gut yourself, Harry Caray style. Jack! Look, sweetie, you don't really wanna go around killing people, do you? Ugh. Look, I gotta go. You know, before I lose face. Jack! Great. Another day in hell. Fresh meat. Keep moving. Come here. Popi needs attention. Leave those prison girls alone. Hey, bitch, why don't you come with me for a little party? Screw you, dyke! That's what I had in mind. Leave me alone! Slut! Why don't you go and pick on somebody your own size? Oh, I forgot. Nobody here is flat as you are, huh? You fucking bitch! Get off me, you bitch! I'm gonna sit on your face a suffocate you, bitch! No bitch messes with Crystal! This is my yard! Yeah. Kill her! There's a fight in the prison yard. Want me to take care of it? Si. My lucky day. Get her! You have the devil in you, so I'll kill Satan's mistress. Damn. Three darts? Must be on PCP. A werewolf is not just a creature. It's a curse. And this curse has been passed on to you. Take her to the desert. No! Leave her alone. She was only protecting me. Then you can go with her. Hey. Didn't expect you to wake so soon. How long have I been out? Maybe an hour? Would've been better if you never woke. Where are we? They call this place "The Toaster." Only a few girls I know came out here. None of them made it back. Most of the time you end up toast. The hot wind cuts through you like a knife. Look Rachel, water. Fuck! Left out like we're fucking dogs. Guess we are. Damn. Bastards! They did it on purpose. They're probably watching and laughing. Making bets whether we survive or not. Now that's what I call a couple of hot chicks. What do we do? What are you doing? Your sweat. It's like water. It might be the only way for us to survive. Very hot American chicks. Damn! Yeah. Muy caliente. I think it might be true. What? Last night. I saw Jack. Your dead boyfriend? Yeah. He told me we were attacked by a werewolf and that I would become one tonight when the moon is full. I think the sun's really getting to you. I broke that girl's arm like it was a twig. It took me three darts to put me down and in less than an hour I'm up again? It was a freak adrenaline rush, Sarah. There are no werewolves. Tonight we shall see. Where's Rachel? The warden thought it's best to separate you love birds. But don't worry, you can always lick the sweat off my ass. We're gonna get that bitch. That bitch broke Serina's arm. I'm gonna break that bitch's neck. Is this all you got? She looks a little beat up and tired. You can have her for a discount. This will liven her up a bit and make her more compliant. Here is the key for the handcuffs. Use it at your own discretion, man. I will not be responsible is she tears your eyes out. Ow, that hurt. It's okay. Mommy will make it feel better for you. You know what I want. Does it hurt anywhere else? Ow, right there. Hey, hey, hey, mamacita. Garcia. I need some cigarettes. That girl, she kicked your ass and made you look like shit, huh? Fuck up and give me a cigarette! It ain't that easy, mamacita. You know what Garcia wants. You have such a pretty little mouth. Oh fuck no. Oh yeah. You better have a whole fucking carton of cigarettes. And some mouthwash. Wait. I got a better idea. Keep your cigarettes and rat poison. I'll do this for free. Yes. If. If what? What's the catch? If the captain knows I let you out. Come on, it's this way. This is the cell. You make it quick, mamacita. Give me your weapon. A weapon? Yes. Give me your flashlight. I don't know about this. Come on, Garcia. You don't like her either. Look at her. Passed out. Probably drunk. You make it quick. No bitch messes with my Serina! What is it? Oh my God, it's her skin, Garcia! It's her goddamn skin! Garcia! Garcia, let me out! There they go again. Grab the M-16. No, wait. The tranquilizer darts. If it is what I think it is, this could be a tremendous opportunity. What the fuck is going on? Hide! Hide! El Diablo! Is it gone? Which way did it go? This way! Noisiest prison I've ever been in. Doctor! I need more morphine. The pain is killing me! Wait until I get my hands on that American slut. I will rip her heart out and feed it to the dogs. Doctor! I need morphine! I'm dying! Dios m√≠o. Where is it? This way! Come on! Fuck me! Oh yeah! Where's that stupid butcher of a doctor? It hurts. That American bitch! I will separate her tits from her body! Doctor? It's about fucking time. Kelly? What happened? It's horrible, Serina, just horrible. You kill that bitch? Please tell me that's the blood of that slut. It's BB's blood. BB's? What? A monster ripped her in two. Smashed through her bars like they were toothpicks. Warden and Rita are chasing it. I slipped through the bars and came here. I bet that bitch Sarah had something to do with this. We must try to escape. I'm in no condition to escape. Then stay here and die. I'm leaving! It's here! Ow! Let of of my arm, you're hurting me! It's only the rats. Oh my God! This is the noisiest goddamn prison around. God, is that all you got? Sarah? Sarah, it's me. Rachel. Stop! I want her alive. At all costs. I want her alive. Those darts won't... These darts are three times more powerful than the ones we used this morning. Don't worry, pumpkin head. It's just me. Good old Jack. Jack. Now do you believe me? Jack, I don't wanna live like this. I killed people. What can I do? Shoulda killed yourself. You know, like I told you. I thought you were a dream. Yeah? Well now you're a nightmare. What can I do? Now that you've tasted human flesh, you won't be able to kill yourself. And that full moon thing, forget about it. What do you mean? Well that's only good for the first time. Now you'll be able to mutate anytime, full moon or not. When the moon is full, you won't be able to help yourself. And the hunger for blood, unstoppable. This is bad. Can't say that I didn't warn you. I gotta go. Go where? Well, I'd like to say to the happy hunting ground, but I can't go anywhere. Why not? Until the curse of the werewolf is lifted, I'm trapped in this limbo. I'm stuck helping psychics and making lame appearances at people's seances. You know, "Help my daddy." I did my best to warn you. Will I see you again? Jack? All the bodies have been disposed of and the prison has been cleaned. Good. Are you going to shoot her with silver bullets? Only if I have to. Think of the money we can charge? "Come and see the innocent, stupid American" "turn into the ferocious beast." "A real life werewolf." I'll be... We'll be rich, Rita. Yeah. That would bring in a lot of money. We start tonight. Rita, I need you and Marcus to round up some new prisoners. It seems we're a little low and have some empty cages. Yes, sir. So tired of all these women here. I need a man. A real man. A man like you. Why don't you come in here and show me what a real man can do? Rachel. Come on, let's get you out of here! Rachel, you have to kill me. I'm not gonna kill you. You're my only friend. You have to. You saw what I did to those people. Yeah and they deserved to die. No one deserves to die. Not like that anyhow. Look, you could've killed me and you didn't. I would've killed you but they shot me. I'm an uncontrollable monster. When I looked into the eyes of the beast, I saw you, Sarah. To me that means that there is still hope. Come on, we can fight this thing together. You have all been charged with very serious crimes. You may be here awhile. You have to wait for the judge to sober up. You can make things easy on yourselves or you can make it hard. I prefer you make it hard. Very hard. Sir, Sarah and Rachel have escaped. Idiot! You and Marcus go after her. I want Sarah alive! I don't care what you do with the other one. Go! Yes, sir! Call the Badger. Do you think that's necessary? Don't you ever, ever question my judgment again! Now go! Do not think any of you can escape. If my guards don't get them, the desert heat, rattle snakes, and poisonous giant tarantula spiders will! There is no escape! I'm having a few guests over this evening. You treat them well and I will treat you well. Very well. Where we going? There's a mission nearby. We can hide there. We're close. We should wait for the Badger. Badger. We don't need no stinking Badger. This way. I gotta a rest. I can't. Let's go. I can't. Sarah! That was easy. Sarah! Hold her! I'm gonna have a little fun with this one. I don't need no stinking sliver bullets. Rachel. They call me Badger. Dead or alive, you come with me. Where's your friend? I don't know. Juan, it's Badger, come in. Juan, it's Badger, over. Juan, come on in, it's Badger. Juan, come on in, it's Badger. Did you find her? Not yet. One of your boys has been disarmed. I think it's Marcus. She can change without the moon. Yeah. She showed superhuman skills in the prison fight. Find the girl. This is gonna cost you extra. A lot extra. Not now, Rita. We gotta get that Yankee bitch back! We go this way, bitch! See what your girlfriend is capable of? What do you think would happen if she changed while she was eating your pussy? She would never do that to me! You are dead! And you are bait. Let me go, you pig! I see why she likes you. Maybe Badger likes you more. Let's see a little more of you. Come on, you gringo bitch! Come out or I'll kill your little girlfriend. Shut the fuck up. Sarah. Sarah, no. No. No, Sarah. I'm your friend. No, don't! What did I do? You don't wanna know. I think I can control it. At least in the daylight. You didn't harm me. Yet, but I will. The lust for blood is uncontrollable when the moon is full. That's what Jack told me. You know, we better go. Yeah. Let's get to that... Sarah! Sarah! Sarah! Sarah, no! You bastard! The name's Badger. Hi, pumpkin head. Gnaw anyone to death lately? Not funny, Jack. I know. But you know what they say. "A little levity goes a long way." Why do you keep showing up if there's nothing you can do to help me? You're coming to the end and I'll be waiting for you on the other side. I'm just here to let you know that it'll be okay. Okay? I've killed a dozen people. Oh yeah. But they were a bunch of assholes. Besides, you know what they say. "What happens in Canpuna stays in Canpuna." I'm going to hell. Sarah, I'm afraid that this is as close to hell as you get. Only death can send you to a better place. Tonight is the last full moon of this month. In a few hours you go completely berserk. The warden's made silver bullets. Get him to use them on you. Yipe! Uh. Ew. I better go before I blow my head off. Why are you doing this? The warden's having a party tonight and he wants you to be there. Then tell the warden that I have different plans. Your friend, Sarah, is the guest of honor. Girls, now! I said it's a party. Swallow it! Swallow it! Just a little something to put you in a party mood. After all, what would the beast be without her beauty? Robin, Fellicia, Maria. Here you go. And a lot extra, as I promised. What're you going to do with her? I'm gonna put her on display and charge lots and lots and lots of money for people to watch her change. I think you should kill her. Take you silver bullets and shoot her in the heart. Oh come on. There's no money in that. She's a person suffering from a disease. She wants to die. Let the show begin. You're making a big mistake. I'll stick around and see what happens. Pole! Dance! Yeah! Yeah! Woo! Woo! Man, this better be worth it. I paid a bundle of money for this. Captain Juan knows we're good customers. He will not screw us. Good. Woo, yeah! Shake that ass, bitch! Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I hope you are enjoying the pre-show activities. And now the moment you have all been waiting for. She's killed my men and prisoners alike. Part-woman, part-monster. Badder than old King Kong. Meaner than Godzilla. Gentlemen, I give Sarah, the wolf creature! All right, we've been screwed. Juan, my little sister is scary than that. Yeah, come on Juan, what're you trying to pull? Yeah! I demand refund if this is all we're gonna get. Gentlemen, calm down. The point is to see her change. Transform from this vision of beauty into that of the beast. Okay, I'll see that. Yeah, let's get on with it. Rachel. This is promising. It's getting good. Oh yeah. But I still don't see no monster. I know. Fuck you! No! No! Stop! Stop it! No! Is this gonna happen to us? Stop it! No! Yeah! Woo! It's a trick. It's gotta be a trick. Disgusting. She's coming apart. So gross. Fuck! Do not worry. These chains are made of the finest steel the great Republic of Canpuna has to offer. Relax. Relax everybody. Just in case, I have made silver bullets also. Rita, release Rachel. Si? Si! Shoot her! Shoot her! Shoot her! Spoiled my shot. It won't open! Go this way! Give it to me! Give me that! Give it back! Get back here! Get back here with them silver bullets, pendejo! You and me, puta! Mano a mano! It's open, come on! Hide! Hey, save some for me. We may be here until the next full moon. Rachel! Rachel, Rachel, Rachel! Oh my God, Angel. Where have you been? Solitary confinement. Rita's been photographing me for her prison Girls Gone Wild website. What is going on in here? The story's true. About the Chupacabra? No, no, no, forget about the stupid Chupacabra. There's no goat sucker. It's Sarah. Sarah is a she-wolf. Sarah did all this? Yes and she need help. I don't think she needs help. I think we should get out of here when we have the chance. Come with me. How many bullets did you make? Six. How many do you have left? Four. Three. Fuck this shit. I think she's gone. Look what that puta did to my stomach! Am I gonna be like her now? I think you gotta be bit. It's a whole saliva thing. Exchange of bodily fluids and stuff. I could shoot you if you wanna be safe. Just kidding. What is it? She's in the crawlspace. Idiot! Don't shoot what you can't see! You don't have enough bullets for that. Two. Two is enough. She can't get through the ceiling. Can she? Shoot it! Shoot it! Stick that on your website, bitch! No! No! No! No! Sarah. It's me. It's Rachel. It's Rachel. I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm not gonna hurt you. I love you, Sarah! Rachel. Save the last bullet for yourself. You've been cursed. I'm sorry. Here, take this. Why do you want me to have this? You'll find out the next full moon.
