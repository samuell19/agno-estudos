Based on Rolli character and songs created by Allu Tuppurainen Malcolm! Malcolm, listen. Don't try to hide. I don't like it when you... Listen, if you don't show yourself right now... Malcolm! I've been looking for you all over for two days now. Malcolm the Maggot has vanished! I'm singing... Children, time for school! To school now, quickly! Juniper! - Rolli! Don't scare people like that! Malcolm the Maggot has vanished. ROLLI AND THE SECRET OF ALL TIME Help! I'm going to be fish food! I told you not to mess with me! You were lucky not to get into a fight with me! Malcolm the Maggot's great adventure will remain in history books! Hey! Whoa! Time to make a U-turn! Stooooop! Fly for your life! Otherwise we are former maggot and crow! Take the straightest route to Rolli Village! La-la-la I'm singing La-la-la I'm singing Rolli! You just ogle there while others are making art! I trust you have an explanation? Well... Malcolm the Maggot has vanished. We haven't seen him for two days. His hole is near the brook. Rolli fears he has fallen in and become fish food. What are you talking about? Malcolm who? What maggot? I remember Rolli talking about him. The small, green... Ah, Malcolm the Great! That tiny worm Rolli thought was a dragon! Worm! - Don't make fun of him. You must speak of Malcolm the Great with respect. And now Malcolm the Maggot is gone. Hey! - Malcolm! Holy smokes! The end of the world is near! Come quickly! If news of this spreads, there'll be mass hysteria! It's important to keep this within the headquarters for now. Within the executive team! Executive team? - That's us! Stay back! We have an emergency. Everything will be fine as long as you stay calm and avoid mass hysteria! Mass hysteria! Is there cause for concern? A-at l-least I'm not afraid! The sun is setting and the day is coming to an end. Evening chores, everyone, and then it's bedtime! Step on it! Get ready for bed, everyone! You heard it. Move it! And then I saw it. Luckily the old, loyal crow had followed me... Hold on, Malcolm... What did you see? I'm not sure what it was. Some sort of reptile, I guess. Perhaps even my cousin, except it was humongously bigger than me. How much bigger? - I can't say an exact figure, but I would estimate... I'd say... A hundred... two hundred... three hundred million times my size. Maybe even bigger. - So, tell us... Where did you see this big cousin of yours? At the Beginning of All Time. The place where the storks come from. Storks? I fell from a stork's beak in a small bundle. So did you, Rolli. I fell from an old crow's beak. I had no first class flight, you know. The Beginning of All Time! That's where we came from! We have to get ready for the trip! Tomorrow we head for the Beginning of All Time! No, juniper. Malcolm might have been hallucinating. I don't hallucinate! But the journey is dangerous. You'd have to cross Eternal Mountains and Eternal Desert, go through Eternal Forest, and cross the Endless Sea. Come on, now. I'm staying in Rolli Village. This is my home. It's good to be inside these walls. When I was just a tiny bundle, I lived and hid in this box all summer and all winter. I peeked at others from here. Without even knowing who I am. But you have a home now! And we're all one big family. One big family! That's right. Rolli Village finally became my home and I couldn't have a better one. And I couldn't have a better friend than you, Rolli. But still I... If only you understood me. - I do understand you. The stork whose beak I fell from... Where was she coming from? I'm sure the answer awaits at the Beginning of All Time. I must know where I came from. We can make the journey. We all wonder where we come from and what the meaning of everything is. Yes, but... - Everybody wonders what life has in store Some feel down and blue Others like to laugh more Some have pretty songs to sing Others make nice paintings And others just chuckle away Yeah yeah, I see Uh huh... - That's the purpose of it all Yeah yeah, I see Uh huh... - That's the purpose of it all Listen,juniper. We can't embark on such a journey. I'm not a young boy any more. The whole thing sounds... You're afraid! - Now listen... You sure talk the talk. Telling tales at campfire. When push comes to shove, you want to hide. Wha... what... You don't dare face that big reptile! I don't fear anything! - You do! No! - Do too! I am the terrible Rolli! Prove it! Come with me to look for the Beginning of All Time. Listen,juniper. I hate to make you sad, but... There's no point in looking for something we can never find. That's right! - All your questions have no answer. No matter how hard you look. You won't find the Beginning of All Time. Fine. I'll go alone. See you when I get back. Unless I stay where I came from. I guess there's nothing else to do. Don't do anything reckless, Rolli! You can't intervene with this, Malcolm. Juniper! Juniper! We'll start travel preparations straightaway. And at the break of dawn we'll embark on an exploration. And you, Malcolm, can tell us the route. You say we have to climb over the Eternal Mountains? Over Eternal Mountains, across the desert, too Through Eternal Forest, that's the route I'm Malcolm the Maggot, follow me if you dare I'm a brave adventurer Bring your map and your compass Your ice pick, too Don't forget to bring enough food Take enough to drink or you'll dry up and shrink Hear what I say and you'll be on your way That monster is gigantic Guzzling water like he's frantic But it never touches stronger stuff He inspires fear and terror With his mighty fangs His skin on my wall would be enough Rolli! What on earth are you looking for? Good thing you woke up. Listen, I need mountaineering gear. You know, wedges and hooks and that kind of stuff. What do you need them for? - Mountain climbing. I have a new hobby. I plan to climb... My plan is to climb on top of that boulder. And further on to the roof of my hut. I don't quite get it. - Uh-huh? Don't you know how to make the necessary gear? I know how, alright. Wedges... Juniper! This early in the morning? Is everything OK? Yes. I just want some fishing hooks. I heard you have some. Yes... - And some fishing line. And spices. At least Rolli pepper and salt. And a few apples. - We'll have breakfast soon. Yes, but Rolli and I are taking a trip. We are terribly hungry and have no time for breakfast. A trip, you say? Can I make soup with this then? I'll tell Blacksmith this will be the last time he starts so early... The clothesline! Where has it gone? Thieves, maybe? I... I took the rope. I needed it because... Rolli has taken up mountaineering. These are all ready. That was fast. That's good because we're pressed for time. Rolli, tell us what you're up to. - Count on me and juniper. Juniper! juniper, it's time to go! I demand to know where you are going. You could tell us a little more about your intentions. We'll warm up by climbing to the peak of Eternal Mountain. We might see Malcolm the Maggot's big cousin up there. I thought Malcolm would have come to bid us farewell. I guess he's sleeping in his hole. Maybe you should reconsider? - Why not use the gate? It's open. Great adventurers never take the easy way. When I was younger, I always took off with this catapult. So, Big Rolli. Pull the lever when I say, "Go!" Eternal Mountains should be somewhere... over there. Take a look. There they are! Let's make camp here and continue in the morning. Take my knapsack... If you cross that unknown mountain You may enter a frightening world Even if your past is new to you The future's more important still The future's more important still The future's more important still More important still It's not enough just to be brave You're on your way to the unknown You can't just walk to the beginning of time Turn back while you can Turn back while you can Turn back while you can While you can Tiny bugs like that don't scare me. I won't give up. Maybe we have to find another route. - There is no other route. We just have to keep pushing on. Perhaps... a little rest will do you good. You seem out of breath. Juniper... We can't do this. We have to go back. - You can't be serious! What other choice do we have? At least we tried, juniper. Sometimes you have to give in to the impossible. I shouldn't put you to peril, anyway. You're still young and... Malcolm the Maggot! - I knew you'd need me. This is exactly that sort of a moment. You won't take me... I'll tame you! Take the rope in your beak. We'll help those two up. Hold on tight! We'll be crushed! That was some stunt you pulled, Maggot. Is that how you thank me for the ride? You should get to the other side of the mountain through that rain. To the Eternal Desert. What about you? - I won't go any further. I'm freezing and dizzy. I'm flying home. Cross your fingers my ride doesn't get hungry. It's snowing! Rolli! Rolli? Juniper? Juniper! juniper! Where did you... Juniper! My hat! Sand? Sudden changes in temperature are tough on someone my age. I wonder which way we should go? Juniper! _ Yes? We made it over the mountain. We can congratulate ourselves for that. But I don't think we'll make it any further. What are you saying? - If we try to cross that desert without knowing the way... - We'll try as long as we find it. It can't be done! We'll be parched and baked to crackers. I don't like crackers. juniper! Drink sparingly. The last drop will be the end of us. What's that? I am Ca MÃ©l, ship of the desert. Your connecting transport across the desert. Good of you to come, for you are my first passengers in a long, long time. Hop on, and I'll take you to the other edge of the desert. I guess that will... - ...be alright. My knee is a bit sore, and this kneeling is not... Everything good up there? Dilly-be-dabby-dibby-dabby... Land ho! - I know where we are. It's a forest! And where there is forest... ...there are cones, too! - Water. Yes. All right, then. Here we are. So you're heading for the Endless Sea? Yes. My friend Malcolm the Maggot told us the Beginning of All Time is on the other side of it. Maggot? - juniper believes we could get there. Continue along that path and you will get to the Eternal River. There you'll meet the Bridgekeeper. - Wait. Who's the Bridgekeeper? Adios. Look at that! Oh, how beautiful! We can't eat it. I get so sentimental in your company. Go on, then! Phew, how ugly! That we can eat. I didn't know you choose your food by its face. Yuck! This tastes horrible. You mustn't say that about food. One must be honest, after all. What if someone said you taste horrible? Tangy Rolli. What...? Maybe we should move along? - No! If we stay close to the fire, that stalking beast won't attack. I hope you're right. - So do I. Let's try to get some sleep in spite of it. I guess the nightly beast has gone. Otherwise it would've eaten us up while we were sleeping. But I am terrifying also in my sleep. My snoring is spine-chilling. Listen! Like giants walking. I wouldn't mind even if it was a giant. Let him come here if he dares. The nightly beast is back! A hedgehog? Hello, wanderers. And who might you be? - I'm Henry the Hedgehog. The bridgekeeper. We humbly ask permission to cross your bridge. I will give permission when I know who you are... I am juniper and I want to see the Beginning of All Time. The place where the storks come from. I am the terrible Rolli and... He wants to see the giant reptile Malcolm the Maggot talked about. Yes... the... Yes, the lizard. Donnysau... Dannysau... - Dinosaur. Yes, the kind of a creature who is approximately... ...one hundred million times bigger than my friend Malcolm the Maggot. And he is the size of my index finger. To be perfectly honest, I can tell you I don't believe in the Last Dinosaur. I don't believe he actually exists. What are those noises then? Ah, that noise? It comes from the Floating Rocks. On that side of the forest there is nothing but the Endless Sea. There is a column of rocks that bang against each other. How can rocks float? - That's right. Fairytales! - What's behind those rocks? There is nothing after them. Besides, the journey from here on is very dangerous. Why don't you just return home? Juniper, I think Henry the Hedgehog is right. Perhaps we... - How can you say that? Fine! I'll travel faster without you, anyway. You go back to Rolli Village and I'll carry on. That girl will be the death of me! Juniper! I really hope you'll find what you're looking for. But what if there's nothing there? Behind the floating rocks, I mean. Or there is something, after all. I couldn't very well encourage her to keep going. But I couldn't forbid her, either. And who knows? You might see your terrible reptile, too. Just a few important things more. Very, very important ones. Quickly then! I'm in a hurry! Is there room on your vessel? I would like to see the Beginning of All Time. This is just a piece of bark and wood. If there's room or not depends on how sturdy this will be. Could I help you? The Floating Rocks! - The ones Henry the Hedgehog mentioned. Juniper, sit down! You are my best friend! - And you are mine! We made it, juniper! We really made it. Look! The water is different colour than before the rocks. And look there! That must be the Beginning of All Time. Now all we must do is sail straight toward the horizon. We must not deviate from our course. Where could we deviate to? I don't know, but that's what Henry the Hedgehog said. "If you make it through the Floating Rocks, you're on the final stretch toward the Beginning of All Time." "just don't deviate from your course." "No matter what happens, you must continue straight toward the horizon." So he knew more than he wanted to say? He just wanted to protect us. He thought we should have turned around. He called you raving mad for crossing the gorge. You came across, too! - Yes. Well, he called me raving mad as well. What's so mad about raving? The Beginning of All Time, here we come! Rolli... Rolli! Come here! Rolli, come. It's coming from that islet. Rolli, deviate from your course. Rolli, what is it? - Deviate from your course. What are you doing? I'm steering a bit closer. - You said we mustn't deviate. Of course not. I'm just steering closer. Deviate from your course, Rolli. She's... just like... ...an elf maiden! Just like Millie the Elf. I'm a prisoner of Misty Island Forever shall I remain here Even though I don't like this place at all I'd like to get away from here anywhere else would be prettier... - Rolli! Hello? But I'm afraid I'll never find the way Oh, can no one think beautiful thoughts anymore? That's the only way you could save us If you could try to do it anyhow You'd make me so happy And our land would turn pretty and lush We have to go and help them! Don't worry, we come as friends! We'll take you with us. Our raft is small, but there's always room for one. Well, two. Where...? Where did they go? Wait! Stop! As truly as my name is Rolli, - I say we've done enough climbing! Don't get agitated. - We demand an explanation! Travellers... Look, the Beginning of All Time is over there. Of course we know that. - Yes, that's where we were heading. But still you stopped. You knew you mustn't deviate from your course. By my dirty... ...clean toes... You seemed nice. We just wanted to help you. I don't think that was the reason you steered toward the island. Listen, you must understand this: You are real. You are responsible for your decisions. We don't even exist. You're standing right there! - No. The Eternal Islet itself makes travellers change their course. Some see this as gold and diamonds and others as various figures. The islet is a mirror of your soul. It shows the true meaning of your trip. It determines if your journey can continue. But we just wanted to help... Yes. Honestly we did. Well, perhaps your help is needed. Perhaps that's the actual purpose of your journey. Where did they...? We're too tired, juniper. They were just a mirage. Hallucinations. Whose hallucinations are they? Hey. don't go! How can there be children here? Listen, tell us if you're real or an illusion? Who are you? I asked you who you were. Would you have the courtesy to answer, please? We don't know. How come you don't know? We fell from the sky in small bundles. The storks were caught in a storm. Some made it but others dropped their bundles. We're the ones who fell here. - That's all we know about ourselves. But... where is your home? This is our home. - Though it wasn't meant to be. We cannot get away. Do you have names? - Who could I be. I asked if you have names. - You heard them already. When we were younger, we kept asking ourselves and each other, "Who could I be?" And named ourselves accordingly. - I am Who. I am Could. - I am I. Hello, strangers! I am Be. Hello, Who, Could, I and Be. Now you know our names and our story. It's your turn to tell us who you are, where you come from and where you are going. I am Juniper. - And I am I. I am I! I am Rolli. We come from Rolli Village. It's our home. And now we're on our way to the Beginning of All Time. You're lucky to have a real home. Rolli Village sounds like one. It is. It's a wonderful place to live. You can take us there! I want to see the Beginning of All Time! - It's not possible. No one has managed to pass the Guardian of All Time. Who's he, then? - A huge lizard. So you believe the lizard actually exists? We've seen it many times. - The giant thing rises from the sea to threaten those who try to travel across the sea. He calls himself the Last Dinosaur. I know! I'm sure we'll get there in your company. What do you mean? Let's all leave the islet and travel there together. You don't get it. If there's a real home for us somewhere, that's where we want to go. Now listen, everybody. Not one of us is sailing anywhere today. The sun is setting and we can't go out on the dark sea. Let's sleep on it. In the morning juniper and I will continue to the Beginning of All Time. Once we've seen it, we'll come back and take you with us. Would that be OK? - We think it's a very good idea. You can sleep in our camp. just follow us. This is where we live. How nice! Yes... At least it's a lot nicer than the wooden box I lived in. Actually we would get along just fine. The sea is full of fish and up there is a spring with fresh water. But the nights are terribly cold. It's getting cold already. I guess it's best to make a fire. I don't mind if my tail catches fire... Where on earth could Could be? - Hey, come quickly! Come on! This is fun! Come and see, quickly! I can sail! I don't know how to steer this! Help me! Jump, Could! - No! He's a good swimmer. - Then we'll lose our boat! We'll stay here forever! -jump! Listen, Could! Turn the sail! Half a turn that way... No! The other way! -jump! Listen! Concentrate! Jump! - Otherwise you can't swim to shore! Jump! No! I ruined everything. I couldn't help trying it out. I didn't mean it. - The main thing is you're OK. That was excellent swimming. Rolli and I will figure... Rolli! Rolli! - Everything under control! I'll bring the boat back. Watch out! Watch out! Rolli, watch out! BY my dirty toes! You are real, really! Turn back quickly! - No! I must encounter him face to face! Now, listen. We have come here as friends. Actually I came here just to meet you. Let's chitchat. Rolli! Listen! You scared the living daylights out of my friend Malcolm, but you won't scare me! Rolli! I was only kidding with you! Save yourselves, if you can! Go, go! Rolli! Look! Juniper, get back! Never! I'll help you tame him. No! It will take tough measures to tame this guy. Stay farther back, that's an order! I know how to handle big blokes. I am the terrible Rolli. Juniper! - Come at me if you dare! No, juniper! Stay... No! Blooming blue blisters! No! Rolli! Yee-haa! Here I come! Malcolm! You were going home. What are you flying there for? The Old Crow came to me and said you really were crossing the sea. It wasn't hard to guess you'd be in trouble once again. But let's talk later. Now I must take care of a dinosaur! Do it quickly. - Hold on tight in the meantime! That's my intention. The Last of the Dinosaurs, I surely know him well The size of this islet of ours, the Last of the Dinosaurs Rolli! His legs are like columns and he's got a scaly skin Each eye is like a saucer but the size of a wash basin Sometimes this huge dinosaur can be lonesome, too That's why I sure hope he would make friends with me and you You'll be alright! I promise! I'm losing my hold! - No! Yes! _ You made it! Malcolm the Maggot and the Dinosaur rescued you! I could have made it myself. No, you wouldn't have. - Yes, I would. No way you would have. - Yes way I would've. No, I wouldn't. Hey! Over here! Is everything OK, Rolli? - Yes! And thank you. You saved me. My friend and I did it together. And now... may I offer you a ride? You? - Or actually him. He happens to be the fore-grandfather of my grandfathers, and we get along just fine. He's just performing his duty by protecting the Beginning of All Time. Would he really give us a ride? Of course! - What about us? My friend is strong enough to carry the whole team, if necessary. We wouldn't leave you behind at any price. Where are we going? Isn't this the wrong way? We're heading for the Beginning of All Time. The Dinosaur said he can let us all in because your minds are clearly pure. I'm not sure if he remembered to peek into my mind... But we thought... We'll pay a quick visit and then go to Rolli Village. Bu Juniper... - We're so close! Why shouldn't we go? What if something happens? If a storm rises or we get lost? I want to go to the home we were promised! We know where we came from and want to go where we are going! Calm down! Be quiet for one second! Malcolm? Tell your friend... ...we're going home. If we saw the Beginning of All Time, we would no longer have a mystery to ponder over. And we would no longer have anything to seek. I don't want to know everything after all. And children... for us to take you home was surely the purpose of our journey. We are all family now, and it's time for us to go to our home! You have made your choice! Rolli and juniper! Rolli brought a whole team with him! And if I may ask... Who might you be? What Could I Be? Yes... See, I have no clue. Ah! You have very pretty names. And tomorrow you get to go to school! School? I'm not even going to ask you what you were doing or where you were, because I wouldn't believe a word of it, anyway. Singing Teacher was worried for you. - Me? I wasn't... Well... Perhaps a little. The main thing is you made it back from your adventure... ...in one piece. We always make it. Yes, Rolli. So you do. So, good morning to you all. Good morning! Whenever we get new pupils, we start with Rolli Village history. Sounds boring. That's what everyone thinks at first but I can assure the history of this village is far from boring. A long time ago, no one but rolli folk lived in this village. Then later, Rolli arrived. He fell from the sky in a tiny bundle. And then we... ...rode the Last Dinosaur back home. Over the Floating Rocks and the Eternal Forest. Over the Eternal Desert and the Eternal Mountains! A wonderful adventure! And such a beautiful story. - Exactly! It's just a story. It's fun, for sure, but don't imagine it is true. Malcolm the Maggot just scared Rolli once again! Bye bye! Bye! ROLLI AND THE SECRET OF ALL TIME
