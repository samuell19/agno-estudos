That was an evil demon fish, very very big. When the couple bought it home, no one could control it. The fish got them all wet. Finally, they chopped off the fish's head, but the fish's body was still alive and jumping. After they were finished preparing the fish, they wanted to take a break. - The man hugged the woman from her back. - Haha. - Listen! When they were making out, the woman's eyes suddenly stared at the fish's head without moving. The man asked her what's wrong. She said: "The fish's eyes just blinked". No way! Fish don't blink eyes, not to mention it's a dead one. - I'll stop talking if you are not interested. - I'm listening. Then she took the fish head with her hand. When she was about to reach the head, the fish suddenly jumped up, higher than one foot. Then it bit her hand. - Don't touch me. - Yanzi. - Let go! Actually, I'm feeling bad too. You are a good man. - Can you tell me the truth? - I'm telling the truth. You are a good man. However I don't see a future with you. What do you mean? Are you afraid to be dumped by me? Humph?! You dump me? I know you too well. You are not brave, and too weak. Never mind, it's too late to talk about this. Let's just be friends. Hey, are you alright? I'm leaving. What happened to you? The fish eyes seems to blink. Haha, look at you! You actually believed this. Ugh, I'm so tired. Hey, truck driver. Can you make a stop? Can I get a ride? - Sure, get on the truck. - Thank you. The bus runs every two hours, it's very suffering. Looking for a job in Beijing? Yes, what about you? I just quit my job. - Why? It's not easy to find one. - True, but I have made my decision. I want to start my own business, these are what I plan to sell. - What kind of job are you looking for? - I don't know... Maybe I should do whatever I can to support myself. Do you agree? I agree. Do your family reassure you came to the city alone? My family didn't know that I came out to work. Wow, that's a bold decision. Your lipstick make you look flirty, that might cause you trouble. Don't you dare! I dare not to do such a thing. Are you alright? Motion sickness. Be careful, don't fall off the truck. Come over here, be careful. - Do you feel better? - I get car sick all the time. I'll be fine. It is too bumpy here, I'm going to tell the drivers to let you go to the cab. Sir, sir! please make a stop. What happened? Can you let her go to your cab? She has motion sickness. - Sure, hurry up. - Thank you. He said fine, can you move? Watch your step. Be careful. Be careful. Thank you, sir. (Girl screaming.) (Man's voice: fuck!) What are you doing! Hey! Hey, you woke up. Why did you park here? Little problems, easy to repair. Hand me the wrench on the floor. Where are the others? Ha? Who are you talking about? (Girl screaming.) What's wrong? Where are you going? Come back! He is not in the woods. - The guy got away? - Yeah, he got away. - He's gone? - Yeah. - Hurry up, we can't keep her alive. - What should we do to her? - Take her? - Take her with us. - Put this on. Get up. Hurry. (Short breath.) Hello, this is 110 call center. I'd like to report a crime. - Can you tell me your name and address? - Can I stay anonymous? Sure, please keep going. It happened at noon on the 17th, about 12:30pm. Hum, I was on highway 103... trying to get a ride. A big truck came, and I got on the truck. There were 2 drivers on the truck. There was a girl on the trunk. We both stayed on the Ba-... back trunk. The girl got car sickness, then she went to cab. I fell asleep. When I woke up, I didn't know what was going on. The truck stopped...I..I.. Don't panic, coward. Who are you telling stories to? You're acting like a joke. You fucking freaked me out! Guilty conscience. Here, I came to return your keys, and take my clothes. May I? What's wrong, are you upset again? What is the matter? Hum... What does it feel like for a girl get raped. I have not been raped, how do I know? Are you crazy? I have to go now. Coming. You're back? Your boss is over there. - Boss. - Who is there? - Boss. - Why are you coming back? Aren't you going to start your own business? Forget about it, I lost all the goods. - Lost? - Yes. - Where did you lose them? - On a truck. It didn't matter. Check these out, this is your favorite liquor. Come on. Boss, can I come back to work? Please. To be honest, I was thinking of you these days. Repairing this car is your job now. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!! This furniture worth 200RMB. - Hey, second-hand dealer. - Yes? - Do you take used television? - Sure. What's your apartment numbers? - Hello, I'm the dealer. - Hold on, who is there? - I'm the dealer. - Come in. No sound? Try this. The connection port is loose. - It's working. - A female body was found in the woods near the highway. The police department confirmed after forensic appraisal: The deceased was violently raped and strangled, which caused her suffocation. The police department has launched an investigation into the case. In order to provide justice and fight crime, the police department calls on citizens to take active actions and cooperate closely with them. Please contact the police department if you have a clue. (Unrelated news) There are all kinds of people these days. Today is so hot. Get me some tea. - Get me some tea. - Ohh, o...okay. Hey, hey, kid! Come here! Come, kid! Come here!! (Sport game sound.) - Here? - Yes, it's here. Why didn't you report the crime at that time? Are you sure that the dealer was the short guy? I'm sure! Otherwise he would not slip away from my home. You just said you were asleep at that time, how did you know what happened? - I heard it after waking up. - What did you hear? I heard the girl was screaming. Right here, in the woods, very heartbreaking. Did you see it? Are you sure they took the girl with them? Why it sounds like I did the crime to her. I'm leaving if you don't need me. I hope so. However, young man, you can't leave now. I'm sorry you have to see that. Those bastards. - I never knew they torture her like that. - So, she is the girl you saw. - She looked like her. - Do you confirm that? I can't really see her face after what they have done to her. - Where did you find the body? - 6 miles away from the woods, next to a river. Check this out. It was right next to the corpse. This might belongs to the victim. Those bastards... Those bastards! Fucking those bastards! I have something to do, I'm leaving now. It's been a week since you were leaving at this time. That car, you have been repairing it for three days. It's even worse now. You couldn't even start the car. Anyone here? Someone is here, go take his case. - Please, I really need to go. - Where are you going? Dating? Excuse me, sir. Please check out my car. Go check the car. Go ahead. Check it out. What's wrong with the car? Front? Not there, sir. It's here. That's really rare. - What kind of car is this?! - Sir, it's a decent car. Hey. He wanted to go to other place to repair the car, but I just brought him here. Every miller draws water to his own mill. Who is he? - How does he look like? - He's okay. He looks like a good man. Are you teasing me? Believe it or not, he is a real somebody. He has his own business. Should I introduce you to him? Maybe next time. (Next stop is Yong He Gong.) (Newspapers, newspapers.) Hey! Hey! Hey! Hello? Don't you know me? I don't remember. That's not possible. You got the wrong person. Hey, take it easy, I'm not a bad person. I mean, your hair looks pretty, is that a wig? You are annoying, stop following me! I'm begging you, please tell me if you were the girl. I don't care how you see me, I just want to confirm you are alive. - You are crazy! I don't know you, get lost! - Wait! I don't believe there are people who look the same except twins. I'll follow you until you tell me the truth. I'll call for help if you keep following me! Sure, do it. What's wrong with your people? Why isn't anyone helping her? Yeah, just like me. Let me ask you one more time: was that you? Otherwise it must have been your twin sister. Yes, I have a younger sister. Are you lying? Do you know her? What's her name? I don't know. Liar. Why do you need to find her? What's your relationship with her? - Who are you referring to? - Aren't you looking for my sister? - I owe her. - What do you owe her? She saved me once. If it's like this, you should stop looking for her. She's dead. Wait. The guy is stalking me, don't let him in. - Sir, it's member only. - Member only? - You have to be a member to enter. - No, I'm not a member. - Sir, you need vip membership first. - You just don't want me in! Sure, I'd like to register now. This way, please. Hello, sir. - I'd like to be a vip member. - Sure. - How much does it cost? - 2000RMB. Fuck you. Hello, sir. Please check on the car door: it can't be fully closed. - What's wrong? - Can't close the car door. Sir, for someone rich as you, why not get a new one? Boss, it's a decent car. Yo, looks like you are doing good. What? The trash car is not working, again? Yeah, all the time. He's more thoughtful than he looks like. - I'm actually looking for you. - For what? - Can I borrow some money from you? - Money? For what? For call girls? I'll take that as compliment. But no, I need money for some emergency. How much do you need? About 2000 RMB. What about the money you showed me last time? - What money? - The money you saved for our wedding. I lost all in my business. I'm telling you, even you are... but you never lied to me. - Even what? Say it out. What was it? - What are you doing? I don't have that much money. I have to say, your self-esteem is a lot higher than it should be. You weren't like this before. Hey Yanzi, who is that guy? Not your business! Why aren't you stopping me this time? Didn't you said I need a membership? I'm getting membership now. It's fine. Stay here. So I was right. Close the door. I don't get it, why are you so stubborn about it? I couldn't fall asleep. - You were in my mind all the time. - Me? Were you thinking of me being raped? I freaked out and peed on my pants. Now I felt it was my fault getting someone killed. Don't think that way. It's normal to act that way in that situation. Since then... my hands were always trembling. If there is a cup of water on the table, I will definitely splash it. If there are two thermos in the kitchen, I will definitely pick the empty one. You will be fine. I recently found that human is the most tenacious creature. Would you get panic sometimes? Panic? Do you mean worry? Not worry, it's panic. People worry about getting fat, or too much rain, things like these. Panic is different. It makes you feel nauseous, scared, and sweaty. You don't know exactly what you are afraid of. You have feeling that something unlucky is going to happen. But you don't know what is going to happen. Do you know hat did I mean? I had this feeling on the day when we first met. Really. Fuck you. I'm done! We need to bury her in the woods when we make the next turn. Say something! No, we should wait till the night. - I don't want to lose my life in here. - Stop talking. ??? Screaming? No one will hear you here. Hey, are you fucking crazy? Get up. Up, up, up. Get up! Captain Liu, Lei Haiyang is here. Please come in. Have a Sit. Yangzi, get him some water. Gao, take care of the case with Han. - Let's go, Han. - Sure. - I actually want to talk with you. - Me too. This wasn't the girl I met. You know this too? But this girl was also on the truck. But she was dead at that time, and was stored in a safe. That's right, I was sitting on the safe. But I had no idea there was a corpse inside. How did you find out? I'm a detective. Come here. Check out those people, is there anyone looks familiar? Yes, I see him He's the short man on the truck. The second one from the left. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. Double-check your choice. You two, switch. - Double-check your choice. - Yes, that's him! I wish him dead. Get up, up! They worked together to rape and kill girls. - They are psychos. - Serial killers? Wow, you know a lot from films. I didn't know if they were real. It's my first time dealing with something like this. They started in Urumqi and later went to Shijiazhuang. For this case, we have not slept well for several months. Now we have some clues, you helped a lot. When will he be executed? It's not that easy. We don't have enough evidence at this moment. No to mention the big man was still out there. Not enough evidence? I saw it with my eyes. - What did you see? - I saw them raped the girl. Until now, we didn't found the her body, nor did she report the crime. You never mentioned you sat on a safe when you reported. I didn't know at that time. How did you find out? Did you see the girl? Why you didn't mention it? (Singing.) Let's do something else, you're not a good singer. I'd like to be alone for a while. Is there anything I can do for you? We are done, thank you. - Don't you want to report the crime? - No. Since I have no courage to die, I should live my life. Well, I need to work now. Let's not meet again in the future. Wait, you don't want the criminals to be executed? Do you want everyone to know that I was fucked by the bastards?! What will other people think of me?! Would you feel better if you tell the cops the body wasn't me?! How do you see me? Why do you care about this? Do you think I was a coward? Yes. When you said that, I feel more reliable. - It's on the list but you don't have it?! - I'm sure we have it. Go find it now. You see, if guests want the disc, we should find it, otherwise they will be unhappy. Hurry, go find it. Wait, wait, wait! Which song? - Distance makes beauty! - What a good song! We definitely have it! Find this song for us: 55013A. I'm just a waitress. I don't know how so find a song. Stay there! - I need to talk to her boss. - Take it easy. Those guys are only looking for trouble, asking you to serve them. We can't afford losing guests. Maybe you should leave today, I'll tell them you are off work. If they make trouble, what are you going to do? I don't care. I'm so sick of this. I'll just find another place. I think I should do it, I'll just serve the food. Ok, just leave when you are done. It happened before. Usually nothing terrible happened. Be smart. Where is the music disc? - You’re a joke! Do you think she really likes you? - Come here! - Drink! - Did you bring room 6 their fruits? - Come back! - Sir, sir, please have a sit. What the fuck are you doing? Please watch your tongue. You paid to drink and sing here. You can let me know if you have any dissatisfaction. - You shouldn't treat us like this, we are also human. - Screw it! Being rich doesn't mean you can insult us. I have a lot of people like you. I'm telling you, the Karaoke owner is a big deal, you can't afford to piss him off. Hurry, hurry up. Go! Leave! Now! Don't ever come back. - Shut down the Karaoke tomorrow! - Yes, sir! You are crazy! What's wrong with you? Stop it, stop! Bro, I'm so sorry about your car. He was testing the car and lost his mind. Don't blame him. Aren't you here to repair the car? I'll take care of it. Boss, I didn't come to repair my car. The door was good. Wipers work well. This is a decent car. I came to see him today. We'll talk about the car door later. How much money did you get from Yanzi? You must return them all today, I have an emergency. Calm down, bro, calm. Here. Fuck you! Kill me, otherwise you will never get rid of me!! Try this. - Son of bitch! - Bro, calm down, take it easy. Get up, get up! You bastard! - Get up! - You get up!!! Are you going to get up or not?! It doesn't matter if you don't say it, we have plenty of time. What happened? He still didn't say anything? He'll start to talk soon. Go get some rest. Captain Liu. He confessed. Can I get a cigarette? Who is there? Anything wrong? What the fuck... What happened? Where is she? (Girl crying) (Girl crying) (Man shouting) Who is there? It's not easy to find your place. You surprised me. Do you eat it everyday? Yeah. Come in. I have been looking for you these days. What makes you so thirsty? Walking all day. Where did you go? With luggage. Nowhere. Walking around in city, I have no where to go. You are the only one I know, so I came to rest for a while. Anything happened at work? I slashed a man's face with a knife. Why? I didn't know. It was a mess in my head at that time. Now thinking of it, I am a bit scared. Are you afraid being retaliated? Yes. Recently, I have been followed by someone. I think they are from the Karaoke. Could he be the big guy on the truck? The big guy is dead. Dead? Drowned. Why am I crying? I dreamed about my mother. I need to go home. Where are you going? - Where are you going at midnight? - I'm going home! Listen to me, the police will help you if you need. Who are you? Why should I follow your words? Calm down! Would you? I dreamed my mom. She missed me. I want to go home! I think, your hair looks better than the wig. I think the wig is pretty. Actually, I wasn't wearing it for prettiness, it made me feel safe. The day I saw you on street, you really fooled me. You were a good actress. I felt uncomfortable. How should I say it? You saw the part that I don't want others to see. - Do you understand? - Yes, yes. To be honest, I feel the same way. I felt embarrassed to ask you. On that day, when we were in the woods, face to face. What did I look like? You don't need to blame yourself. In this kind of thing, no one would be much better than you. Let me go! Let go! Fuck you report to the police! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck! This is for my pal! Damn you! What the fuck! Asshole! Dumbass, why didn't you escape? Where is she? You can't even save your own fucking life now! Back trunk. What did you do to her! I'm going to drown her. I let you go this time. Get out off my face. Release her. - Get lost! - Otherwise you can't leave! You chose this. - Wanna hit by car? - I'd rather die that way than escape! How about this: I'll open the trunk, and you take the girl. What?! Hey, wake up! - What? - You haven't put the door back yet? Tell your boyfriend, it's better to smash this car. What happened to your eyes? Forget it. He has neurological disorder, but kept a secret from me. What is it? Let me put it this way. Do you know epilepsy? He has epilepsy. He was crazy when he had a stroke. Forget about him. Hey, you are on newspaper. - I just bought it. Check it out. - Really? - It’s better for you to be with me than him. - Stop it! Look at what they say about me. He reached his bloody hands out of the car. They were found by the police. A felony criminal was arrested. It's raining. Wake up. Wake up. Don't cry. It's me. Where are we? In a car trunk. On the way. Help me untie the rope. I can't see it. What is it? Seems to be an emergency light Maybe I turned it on by accident. I can't breath. I want to sleep. Don't sleep, don't. Open your eyes. Look at me. If you fall asleep now, you will never wake up again. Let's say something. Like what? That day, in the woods, we were this close. You must imitate what I was like. Even I'm gonna die, I want to know that. (Man singing) Let me tell you a story. A couple bought a fish home. That was a demon fish, very, very big. It took them a lot effort to chop off the fish's head. But the body was still jumping. Suddenly, the girl pointed to the fish's head on the ground and said: "Its eyes just blinked." I got this! I have repaired this type of car before. There are four screws behind the taillight. As long as the four screws are unscrewed, the taillight can fall off. She pointed to the fish head on the ground and said: "The fish's eyes the blinked again." The man said: "Fish don't blink eyes, not to mention it's a dead one." There's only one screw left. My story is almost finished. Why your story is such long? I had no idea what you were talking about. Actually, neither did I. When I heard the story, I was thinking, Anything could happen in one's life. Like, I never know that, we could be trapped in a car trunk. It was meant to happen. Yes, as long as I can breathe, I should find a way out.
