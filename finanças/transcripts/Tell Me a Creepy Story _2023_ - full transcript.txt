I'm just not in a good place to be in a relationship, I know what I said. I'm just too busy right now. I'm sorry Jane. - Hello, you've reached Jessica Ross. I can't get to the phone right now, so if you could leave-- - Hi, you've reached Ben Ross. - Hi, you called about your water. What seems to be the problem? - Hi, yeah, come in. I tried turning on the water and it wouldn't turn on anywhere in the house. My parents said their bathtub wasn't draining last week. I don't know if that has anything to do with it. - Probably not, but I'll check that first. Where's their room? - It's the one right there. - Perfect, thanks. This will only take a minute. - Okay, thank you. - Hello, I'm Levi, I'm from Blue House Plumbing Services, here to check the drain. - No, someone already came, he's upstairs. - That's not right. I'm the only one they sent out. - But someone's already upstairs. - Can't be from our company. I'm the only one that works night shifts. Did you call another company? - No, no, just you guys. - Do you want me to check upstairs? Probably just a misunderstanding. - Okay. He went in that room. - Hello? - Hello? no one's here. - But it wasn't working before. - Maybe he just fixed it and left. - He didn't say anything to me though. - Listen, I've got another house to get to. It's probably just a misunderstanding. - At least it's working. But wait, he was here. He walked. - Probably just fixed the faucets and left. Trust me, it happens all the time. No one's here anymore. - Hey, call me if the water goes out, all right. - Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane. Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane. - Who's that? - Hello? Da's in the big shed if you're looking something. We've no beef left, but we've pig and chucks. - Hello. - There's no beef left. Only pig and chucks. Go on over to the big shed, Da'll sort you out. - Hello? - I don't need any beef. - We have no beef left, pig and chucks and maybe a of eggs, but that's all. - I don't want any food. - What do you want? - I want one thing and one thing only, to share the good word. The word laid down by our father, the gospel according to my Lord and saviour Jesus Christ. Tell me Mrs. - Taggart. - Mrs. Taggart. Tell me Mrs Taggart, are you a believer? Have you accepted the Lord Jesus as your savior? - Long ago, but I'm no one for talking about our savior on doorsteps. You better come in. - Thank you Mrs. Taggart. - You can call me Ma, everyone else does. - And is there a Mr. Taggart? - Da, he's in the big shed. - Your father? - Dear bless us no, my father's dead this 20 years, my husband, we've called each other ma and da since I don't know when. - My grandparents used to do the same thing. - Aye, I suppose it's old fashioned nowadays. - Well, sometimes the old ways are the best. - That's what I keep saying. They wanted us to put the electric here in the house. But I says no, I'm not having them wires in my walls. I stick with my oil lamps. No one knows what that electric does to you. There's wee, Mrs. Convoy down the road. She got the electric in. Next thing you know, she has the cancer in her tits. - Get away with you. - I'm telling you, been buried a year now. - Well, I hope she knew the Lord Jesus. - She did. - Well, isn't that a mercy? - Hey, it is. You take a wee cup of tea? - I couldn't put you to the trouble. - Sure it's made. Sit down. - Thank you. - So what do you do for your living? - I spread the good word. - A minister or a pastor or something? - No, no, a missionary. - What, you mean going to Africa? Preaching to the darkies? - Every man, woman and child deserves to hear the good word. Do you not think? - I know but Africa? - And India and South America. And China and Korea. I have brought the good word to black men, brown men, yellow men, red men. Any shade of man you care to imagine. - My goodness, all them places. Me and Da went to Blackpool once on our honeymoon. We had to get the boat. One thing you won't find in this house is a blunt knife. Da keeps them all like razors. You could shave with that there. - Is that right? - He earns his living from his knives, just like his father did and his father before that. They're all butchers. - It's a good trade. - Keeps us going. We raised a few animals ourselves and some of the local farmers bring their animals to us for butchering. Keeps him busy, milk? - Yes, please. Aye. People will always want their beef. - Aye. - So you sell the meat from here, like a shop? - Sort of, Da works in the big shed. You'll have saw that when you drove up. That's where he sells the beef from. That's where he does the butchering too. - All by himself? - Wee Danny lends a hand the odd time. He's the other sort. But he's a decent enough young fellow. - Is he there today? - No, not today, he's in school today. - So it's just you and your husband then? - Aye. - You haven't been blessed with children is all I'm asking. I didn't want to come right out and say it in case I upset you. - No, no, we weren't blessed. I did pray for things to be different and so did Da, but the Lord had his own plans for us. What about yourself? - No, my wife and I did intend to start a family, but she-- - She what? - She perished. - How? - Malaria, when we were in India. - I'm awful sorry. - She gave her life to the Lord Jesus Christ. She died spreading the good word for him. I will see her by his side when the time comes. - Aye, you will, you will You'll stay for a bit of dinner, won't you? - I couldn't impose on you. - You're imposing nothing. You're staying and that's that. We're having veal. - Veal? - Aye, that's not something you get every day, is it? You'll stay for a bit of veal, won't you? - Well it does sound lovely. - What's that you finished? - Aye. - What's this? - We have a visitor. Mr., you didn't tell me your name. - Ivan, Ivan Cutler, please to meet you Mr. Taggart. - I near caught you red handed. - Should've told you about Da, he's a one. - Look, the red hand of Ulster. - Don't get him started, he'll have you in fits. - Is there tea? - Aye, I'll get you wee cup now. Sit down Ivan. He's a missionary. - That right? - That's right. - So where've you been? - Africa, south America, India, China. You name a place, I've been there. - Borneo. - I spent a month in continental Malaysia. Didn't make it to the island. - Timbuktu. - I actually spent a few days in Mali. Didn't get as far as-- - Phoenix, Arizona. - Do you know I've never been to the United States. - That's three places. - Sorry? - You says name a place, I named three places, you've been to none of them. - Well I was speaking figuratively. I mean obviously there are places I haven't been to. - You were playing the smart man and I caught you out. Isn't that right? - Well, I don't know if I would put it exactly. - You were playing the smart man. - I wouldn't. - You were playing the smart man. - What about yourself, Mr. Taggart? Where have you been? - A few places, but I don't crow about it. - Neither do I but you asked. - It's getting late. You have a bit of a drive to Colraine, if that's where you're for. - Mrs. Taggert asked me to stay for dinner. - Has she now? - That's right. - Is that right, ma? Did you ask this young fellow to stay for his dinner? - Aye. - You sure? - Aye. - Are you absolutely sure? - Aye, I'm sure. - Right, so you're staying then. - If it's not too much trouble? - Oh, it's no trouble for me. - Good. - So what church are you with? - Oh, I'm not with any church in particular. I believe the Lord has many houses. - What were you reared as? - Presbyterian. - We're Church of Ireland, but we don't make any odds between the one or the other, except the payments of course. - Course. - So you're not drumming up business for any church in particular? - No, I'm not working for any one church. I'm a freelancer, as they say. Which brings me to why I am calling on you today. - All right? - Because I'm not affiliated with any one particular church, I'm beholden to good people such as yourselves to fund my expeditions. - Right, so you're looking for money. - For the Lord's work, yes. - We give our tithes to the Church of Ireland every week. There are some weeks we can afford it. There are some weeks we can't afford it, but we give it just the same. - I understand. Well, you've already been more than generous with your hospitality, I don't want to be. What the? I know you're there. What do you want, Taggart? Whatever it is you want, we can talk it through. You want money? I've got money. There's three rolls of it there. I don't even know how much there is there. 150, probably more. It's yours. You can have it all, just tell me what you want. Let me go now, well forget about it, all right? If you don't let me go, I swear to you, I am going to skin you and your bitch wife alive, you hear me? You fucking hear me Taggart, Taggart I know you're there, Taggart, Taggart, let me outta here. Taggart, let me the fuck outta here, I'll fucking kill you, you're a fucking dead man, you're a dead man, you and your fucking wife, are both fucking dead. - So? - So what? - So why him? - I liked the cut of him. - I suppose that's as good a reason as any. Dear Father, we thank you for this blessing, for this bounteous gift today, we eat with gratitude in our hearts. Thank you oh Lord for what we are about to receive, our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory, forever and ever, Amen.
