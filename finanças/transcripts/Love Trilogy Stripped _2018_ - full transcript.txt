My darling. Do you know what time it is? What are dogs doing in the bathroom? Hello you. Everything is fine ? How are you. I feel like a weight on my shoulders. Was anyone here when you went to sleep? Was anyone here when you went to sleep? No, I was working. I worked, then I went to sleep. Do you know you slept with the door open? Yes, sorry. I never liked ’like that STRIPPED Work on the colors, the textures, to decorate the background. Work on the colors, the textures, to decorate the background. - Can we mix it up? - Sure. Make a collage from the photo you have chosen. Assemble your "me" with elements foreign to you. Let's talk about positive things. No serious matters, please. Ok, but I heard earlier on the radio that a rapist entered an apartment and raped a 50-year-old woman. - A 50-year-old woman? - Yes. He came in and he raped her. - I'm worried about my daughter - It's scary. It scares me. - I listened to you, Alice. - Truly ? - Can we finish earlier tonight? - Yes. OK. You do not feel well ? - We'll only pay you 75 ° / o. - No. What is it, Alice? I'm just tired. It was a long day. Hard day '? No, leave, it's better like that, that will give me... - Like that ? - Are you sure ? - Yes. OK. - Good evening, girls. - Have a good evening. Last night, a man breaks into a house and hits a woman. unconscious, he rapes her. I worry about you. I worry about you. - What's the matter ? - That hurts me. You have a big bump. What is that ? - Darling ? - It's me. How is it going ? It's hot. Wait a second. Just a second. - What is happening ? - Nothing, I just wanted... take a shower. - What's the matter with you, sweetheart? - I think it's just... an accumulation of things. You are distant. Is there... Something that you are going through on your own? Do not worry. It has nothing to do with us. There is something, right? Like what ? I don't know, I don't wanna stress you out I am not used to that... It is probably overwork. Sometimes the pressure rises and suddenly knocks you down. - I'm fine. - I care for you. I know. Me too. You are tired ? Sleep. It is the hour of our meeting with an author. She wrote shake the bars of the cage, which one could define as a sensational novel. This book is even more successful abroad than in Israel. This book is even more successful abroad than in Israel. - Hello, Alioe Turgeman. - Hello. - How are you doing ? - Thanks very much. We could explain the success of your book by the daring descriptions you make human relationships, sex, passion. In your opinion, is it this sensationalism that appeals to Europe? Would the book appeal to European readers more? It's possible. I do not know, maybe. I mainly think that it is of a love story between two people. of a love story between two people. That's what hits the readers, I think. "I'm leaving so as not to see the lump in your throat grow bigger, "your hands crushing the grass, in despair, "and the bonfire goes out in your eyes. "Why did you come, Amalia? "I didn't ask you to come, "to spare you the heroic stories "and not to dictate who to sleep with. "Not with me." At the beginning of the book, Alon poses nude in a drawing studio. He is naked, exposed to the eyes of others. This reversal is interesting. Explain to us how the model can also embody a strong figure. From my own experience of drawing lessons, the model is the most powerful. It exerts a visual hold on the pupils. He is the focal point, the cause. To quote the book, it is there to give shape to their ambitions. He helps them become the artists they dream of being. He helps them become the artists they dream of being. When he spots Amalia among the students, it passes from the status of an object to that of its own subject, and that seduces Amalia. In a glance, he pulls her towards him and she is immediately grabbed. In addition to being a novelist, you are a visual artist and director, isn't she? I am in the process of making my first film. It's a documentary on the suction of young men to serve in combat units. We are still in the writing phase. Could you sign my copy? I have a writing project. I would like to see you again to talk about it. A moment. Do you want some water? Just a second. ‘You î Ye. _ ‘Ez de | water ’_> It's OK’ _> We're going to give it some air. Are we calling for help? Tell me if you want me to call an ambulance. - Just a minute. - OK. Do you want to sit down? I can make it slow down a bit, postpone the interviews until later. Maybe it bothers you to tell me about what's happening to you but I'll make sure to... I do not know. Maybe we should go to the emergency room, right? I'm fine. It was a beautiful evening. The public was won over. You really touched people. You can start. Good luck-. Absolute silence from now on. Absolute silence. Come on, big betas. I had a driving lesson today. It was horrible. I was wearing those shoes. - I can't drive with it. - Why ? They are good. No, I can't feel the clutch. I kept stalling. I cannot do military service. I can't give up music for three years. - Are you afraid of joining the army? - No, to have a negative answer. I must get the title of "exceptional musician" to serve as a musician. I do not want... What will you do if you are never recognized exceptional musician? Then I will have a problem. My mom will never let me falsify my medical profile. If I am not taken as a musician, I will have to serve as an officer. She doesn't understand my passion for music. It's beautiful, this love you have for music. I didn't tell you, I had sort of a panic attack the other day. - It's true '? - Yes. I was in my bed, I had trouble breathing. In my head I was ruminating the scariest scenarios. Tell me. You really never had a history with a girl? Not even the beginning of a story? Cluoi ’_> What was that desperate sigh? I can't think about it all the time. Don't think about it, then. But we talk about it all the time. - I never told you. - We're talking about it now. - We talked about music. - It's true. I try not to think about it too much. No problem. But imagine, for example, that a girl tries to hit on you. - I do not know. - She's cute, nice... There is a good feeling between you. Think about that thrill you feel when you're scared that your heart beats at 200 an hour and suddenly you jump into the water. So I rephrase: what do you do if a girl flirt with you? I don't know what to answer you. It doesn't happen every day. - If she's really cute. - It depends, it's... I do not know. These are not things that happen to me. Maybe it's happening to you without you knowing it. That is to say '? Don't you realize the train has arrived. What '? Maybe some girls are hitting on you and you don't realize it. What does it mean ? Ziv, I've been telling you the same thing for a while now. - It's because I... - We always talk like that. As if there was a wall between us. Normally, people look at each other when they talk to each other. Not that close. Here. Don't be so nervous. Stop saying that. Does that make you nervous? Yes, the more I'm told to calm down, the more nervous I get. So I am silent. Very well. I do not talk anymore. We walked away, but you still don't look at me. - You want me to stay like this? - Exactly. - Let's talk about something. - OK. - Yours. It is always me who speaks. - I have no idea. I'm sick of all this exam bullshit. See, I'm throwing a topic, but it's still not okay. This is a bogus subject. I do not know. Cluoi? You do not want '? Good... I'd better go. OK. Do you want a glass of water or something? No, it's okay. Thank you. I am sorry. Do not be sorry. How are you. See you in high school. The world is full of talented people who practice fiercely, day and night. But all that matters is your military service. You're wrong. What matters is luck. So if I don't get the status of an exceptional musician, I will never be a professional musician. No, it just means you don't play for three years. It's the same, if I don't play for three years... - I can not. - It's a whim. - With you, it's all or nothing. - That's bullshit. Bullshit. You're kidding ? Let's try to be polite. I have a little more experience than you, I'll call you back. That does not concern me. Do you think you're above all this? There is God, you, and the world? Do you really think you're on top of it all? The army will decide whether you play music or not. I will refuse. - You know why ? - Tell me. Because I was simply not made to be a soldier. - I am a musician. - What do you know about that ? I know it. Looks like a five-year-old. "I know", you only have that in your mouth. This is childishness. Ziv, we're trying to open your eyes to other possibilities. Don't be stuck, try to consider other options. Can you admit that I am a terminal when it comes to music? No? - Listen to me... - You took too long to answer. It's my role to open you up to other things. No one can put out this fire. I am proud that it is burning and no one can put it out. And it is wonderful. You have a gift, it's precious, but the competition is enormous, especially in music. You need to have a wider range of “Skills. - And good grades. - It's the case. Does having skills mean having good grades? You must understand the importance of... I have validated 10 credits in music, 100 credits for the recital, but you only think about math. Math and English matter, you can't deny it. Come on, let's eat. Most of your friends in the army are not exceptional musicians. - It's true. - So how do they do it? - They're not all fighters. - I ask, that's all. They have no choice, they do what they can. The soldiers are submissive... - In the Army. - They are the property of the army. How do you feel about being in the army? You cannot kill yourself, because you are a good of the army. 'Are your friends talking about it? ' Enough to ? Suicide. Many become depressed. They are trying to get sent back to civilian life. You wanted to change the subject and we are talking about suicide? No it's not that. Man in his thirties tried to break into through a window. No eye contact. To you. Can you give me your number if we need to call you back? - I do not prefer. - OK. Please be aware that we do not disclose anything- C 'is for strictly internal use- Yes, but I told you everything I know. - If you don't have to... - Understood. What is your name ? - I do not prefer. - Alright I understand. - Thank you. - Thank you.

I prefer that we stop seeing each other. Leave me, please. City style Hi Mom. Where are you ? - Home. - I'm calling you, you don't answer. - Why are you taking this tragic tone? - You laugh ? How can you say that after all this time? I'm fine, mom. I was at home, I was working. - Is that all you have to tell me? - Sorry you worried. I was immersed in a project, I couldn't speak. Good. So how are you ? It's okay, I'm fine. Well Î? That's all. 7 Yes I work. You have disappeared. I thought that something didn't // have. - I always imagine the worst, you know - I understand. I watch television, [hear what happens to women. - These things happen... - You're dramatizing, mom. I'm fine, I'm working. Sorry to worry like that. What can I do about it, 7 You have to put it into perspective, you can't let yourself be dominated by your fears. I can not help it. I see. You leave me in doubt. Once again, we don't really get through. It's like that, I do with it. CDK- q. - See you more. - See you soon, my Honey. You know those kind of canker sores in the mouth? Yes. Like after eating hot. I got it all over my mouth and throat. I couldn't swallow anything. Do you still have some? It's better. I hardly feel them anymore. But it will surely come back. It's been a horrible month. I can not do anything. You can jerk off as much as you want. You have a room all to yourself. Think about it. But if a doctor comes in at that time... - Preferably a woman. - Are there cute nurses? -No. - Stopped ! Have you seen any cool videos lately? - Videos '? - Yes, I have one to show you. My video library contains exclusively videos of naked women. - He's even more obsessed than you. - Serious! Do you know there is a category of porn with nurses? - It is understandable. - Yes, it is very relevant. You‘and‘your porn! You think with your cock. A little. Does it make you laugh ? Come on, a blues. I do the theme... It works. I'm afraid she'll do this because she thinks I'm going to die. a 933G She is kind, for the last moments of the dying. - You shouldn't see it like that. - Yeah, that sucks. - Do not even think about it. - You are right. I'm afraid to miss this, to never kiss a girl. Did you have an exam? - In Civic education, it was. - Cool. I have a meeting for the promo album. Weren't you at the photoshoot? '- “-,‘ an; '"’ Ê ÿ É q L. i -—..._' It's okay ’_> You have taken part in the competition for an exceptional musician. Unfortunately, your application was not accepted Good military service to you. I go up, 0k? - Everything is fine ? - Yes, see you later. Here you are again ? - You don't have the key? - No, not on me. it's okay ’_> - Yes, but... - What's going on? You know when I read a message and you look at me? I did not have the competition of exceptional musician. Ziv, I know you are extremely disappointed, but it's not the end of the world. - Believe me. - I know, but it's hard to swallow. I really deserved it. I do not deserve it ? Am I not good enough? I told you, it's a question of talent, work and luck. - I don't care, I fucking deserve it. - You weren't lucky. It does not make sense. Any sense. Tell me why. Why ? Am I not playing well enough? You're great, but one juror said "great", another said "bad". He's a jerk! - But he's the one who decides. - I do not care. - He's the one who decides. - It doesn't make sense, it's unfair. Come and sit down. No, I want to stay up. I need to move. I bet it didn't play out on the candidates' real talent. Do you want to talk to the principal tomorrow? I don't want to tell anyone about it. I don't want to shout it from the rooftops. - It will eventually know. - Ok, but not by me. - It's difficult for me. - I understand. Maybe I don't have the level. - It's wrong. - I do not deserve it. - Maybe it is. - I do not think so. Do they give a reason? - No. - Nothing '? Just "not held back", thank you and go and show yourself. I have an idea so that, tomorrow, you start the day on the right foot. You could... Don't laugh. My idea will please you. What's this '? I suggest you go with your dad for his jogging and swimming. I don't want to wake up, I don't want to do anything. Stop, I'm hot. Sport can calm your nerves. When you exercise, your body produces lots of hormones that make you feel good. - That would relax you. - I do not want. You will always amaze me. - It's not a good idea ? - No. Not at all. I think we should swallow the pill. It sucks, it's depressing, but it's a fact: you didn't get what you deserved. - Let's swallow the pill, then. - Here is. 'Î _. =:;: 5> E; iîfi. - 'f i î î t.

You should consult that / one as soon as possible. I don't feel able to get out. You can take a taxi and go to the emergency room. There are psychologists there, that's a possibility.

You can tell the girls that there won't be classes today either? Of course, if you're not feeling well. - Thank you. - Are you sure you're okay? I have the impression that something is wrong.

Come with me. - You want something to drink '? - I'll take care of it after. - Soft. - Jack, stop! - Are you doing well ? - Yes, I am fine. What is that smell? Can I ventilate? Just a little bit, to bring in some fresh air. He doesn't want me to move. Why don't you let me move? What's your problem '? Good dog. A real bodyguard. They did not go out for the week. You want to take a shower '? You ate ? How are you feeling ? You slept here. Obviously. - What ? - It's not that obvious. I told you I wouldn't leave you. Hello. - Hello. - You slept well ? - A lot. - You find ? You needed it. Did you sleep well? A lot. I have slept enough. I took care of putting some order. My beautiful. It's okay ’_> We can go to the beach. To take some fresh air. - Shall I take another one? - Its good. Come on, Jack, that's enough. You exaggerate. We know you're all excited to be at the beach, but today, we are here for A | ice. Including ? Calm down. Seated. - Soft. - Sit down. Shall we lie down? Take a deep breath. Its good ! You surprise me. Not at all ? Alma? I'm here, I didn't want to wake you up. What is happening ? What's the matter '? You are not alone, it will be fine. Don't worry, I'm here. I'm here. I am here with you. I'm here. Alice, you'll be fine. I've been there, I know what it is. The treatment has started ’, you will feel better. The treatment will take effect soon, you'll see. I know what it is. It takes a little while. How is it going ? I'm fine. - You feel better '? - Yes. It depends on your state of mind and your outlook on life. - There was something positive at work... -Amen. My patients are making great progress, which makes me very happy. A woman finally sees the light at the end of the tunnel, another sees a ray of hope. It's like, you know... - Are they getting there? - Sure. - Are they getting there? - Sure. - Are they really doing? - Absoutely. It's a long process. - What is the success rate? - I can't answer that. Success is when they know they are not alone, that they can get help without having to pay or be judged. So they realize that another destiny is possible, that they are not obliged to prostitute themselves, but it's a long process. I am not a victim. Victim yourself! I am not the same in my work and in my personal life. In my professional life, I make things happen, I take action. - You are dissonance embodied. - That's it. It's like that. - I don't want to cry. - No, come on. Maybe you just need to vent it all. It's nothing, it's just tears. It's the wine. Tomorrow is another day. Goodbye.

I got your number from RellyAm / r. To PVOPOS of what? I'm making a documentary on young army recruits and she told me you were an interesting boy. I would love to meet you and hear what you have to say on the subject. - OK. - But first, you have to tell me... if you are up for taking part in a documentary film. I believe. Great. What are your availability? I am rather available. I finish classes around 3 or 4 p.m. Sunday would suit you. 7 Sunday, at 5 p.m. 7 OK. Perfect. Where do you live ? 7 Bialik Street, Tel Aviv.

I do not care. let's have the first interview at my place It works. Maybe I'll film you. Your parents must agree. I think they will, I will ask them. - Cool. We do that. - Noted. - Sajut, neighbor. - See you later. Great, see you on Sunday. Good bye and thank you. You're welcome. Do not move. They don't bother you? No problem. - Alice. - Nice to meet you, Ziv. Enough, Nelsie. - Welcome. - I can enter? Sure. Come on, Snow. Come on, get down. - Am I sitting down?% I "here? - Yes. I'm sorry. - You want something to drink ? - Yes, thank you - Water is all I have. - Perfect. Jack, don't move. What were you doing on the roof? - A party with friends. - Nice. You are well surrounded. This is Nelson. There is Jack. And Snow. Come g ‘ - How are you ? - Great. - Are you sure? - Yes. This first meeting does not commit him to anything, like I told you on the phone. Jîgl Maybe I'll turn on the camera, if that's okay with you. No worries, it's up to you. So can I turn it on? Yes. Ok, it ends. Tell me a bit about yourself. _ Qäûrnuçî i '_> OK. My name is Ziv Zuckerman. I live right across the street. I have a rooftop apartment and my parents live below. It's a great arrangement. I play classical guitar. Music is very important in my life. I wanted to serve as an exceptional musician, but I wasn't caught, so... I'm not sure what I'm going to do. How long have you been playing? Since elementary school. I started playing the piano at six years old. - Are your parents proud of you? - Yes, I'm not complaining. - Was that their idea or yours? - Mine. I wanted it much more than them. Nelsie, are you there? - Is that Nelsie? - Nelson. He adopted you. Looks like, Yes. - Thanks, have a good day. - Did they hang out? - Yes. They have been wise. He started to growl. - Who, Nelson? - Yes. - What have you bought '? - A holiday souvenir. I wanted a bottle, but he sold me two. It's a subject that worries me a lot, romantic relationships. Why I don't have one. Are you disturbed ? It's part of life, the relationships. Sure. Have you never had a serious girlfriend? - No never. - Or a friend? - No, I'm straight. - OK. You play guitar. I want to give you something. Nice. - That's great. - Read it. I will read it. - Thank you. - Thanks for reading it. And thank you for coming. So you tell me when... Hi, Jack. - Thank you goodbye. - You're welcome. Your hands are taken, we kiss. shake the bars of the cage I just got home with the dogs. l / s are fine. Big pile. I miss my darlings. Back in two days. Thanks again. A / ice. Î. - I'm calling to thank you. - With pleasure. I wanted to see if you will agree to meet the producer of the film. Tuesday, at 3:30 p.m., was it okay? - OK. - Great. ædäzäwævääaÿy ﬁ ïî? ‘Z t __ \; KŸÀ... '_ It's okay' _> - Good, and you '> - You found 'easily' .7 - Yes, rather. Move in. Shall I get Nitzan? Yes I am ready. - Everything is fine ? - Yes. Hello, Ziv. Delighted. Hello. How are you ? Where do I sit? Here ’_> I want to get involved, but I don't want it to compromise my ambitions. Not playing music for three years... - It is not an option. - I see. I want to hear your point of view, I'm a little puzzled. Yes, you're right. Ziv is not quite what we were looking for at the start. This is not the young recruit with dreams of a soldier in her head that we were trying to study. But he has his own "army". He is in his world of music. - It's true, you are very disciplined. - I must be, yes, otherwise... They are two distinct frameworks, governed by strict rules, which will confront each other. Eventually, maybe he'll really become a soldier. Maybe I was made to fight. I have yet to find out. The question is whether it is a categorical "no" or... What is important is that you know what you want. I don't want to influence him impose my point of view on you, but I feel like you need to refocus. I wouldn't have turned to him first. In Ziv's case, don't take it personally, but I wouldn't bet on him. - Given our intentions... - Yes, we talked about it earlier. You have to find your angle of attack. Being a director is knowing how to feel... It's knowing how to focus on what really matters. - I'm not a director yet. - No that's not it. You know how much I believe in you and in this project. - Are you playing something to us? - I am really sorry... - But no. - He refused at my house too. I'm sorry, really, but... The use, in classical music, wants us to play a concert when we're 100% ready. Play now without having practiced all day, it would be difficult for me. - You understand ? - Yes of course. He's a lovely boy, but I don't feel him enough... - It is serious. - It's true. But it is not interesting enough for a film subject. He's not charismatic enough. Where did this masculine / you go that you were looking for? Yes, he lacks enthusiasm. // is shy. I find it a bit stuck. // couldn't even play that / that thing to us. Exactly, I found it a bit old fashioned. Where is the ardor of youth in all this? shake the bars of the cage Œ-ili! Where's Gili? Stand aside guys, our man is weak. Did you know about it, fagot! It's extra here. It's super high. Come on guys. Everyone seated. This chair is the property of this young man. It's your birthday ! Gili's gift is on the way. A gift he has long deserved because it is serious. He assures, he assures! All we have to do now it's bringing in our surprise, the highlight of the evening. Can someone whistle? I can not. You are the best, man! He was stuck, like, "My God, boobs!" Now that Gili is having fun, know that for the modest sum of 400 shekels, you can do the same and throw yourself in the air. Couldn't the masseuse jerk us off at the end? We can share: 200 each ’? - One in each hole. - No one touches my wife. You first, me next. h Who (ÿaütre ’> - Ziv! ' - You want ? - I do not know. Come on, Ziv! I do not believe it. Dror, me, Ziv... And you. I'm hallucinating, mate. Balance the sauce. Then ? It doesn't happen every day. - What ? - It doesn't happen every day. It's for money, you can pay yourself a whore whenever you want. Why not take the opportunity? I am a virgin, for how long? I don't want to be a sissy. When you think about it you'll regret not having done it with someone you love. You're right. - Give me the money. - Already ? I will go get him. May I... take a whiff? Health !
