Dragged away and forced to sexual slavery, 3 comfort women and 7 other victims, who were mobilized to work at Japanese female labor camps, battled against the Japanese government for many years in the Shimonoseki Trials. This film is based on those true events. You really are amazing. I didn't do anything! I'm lucky to have bright men around. My cook said there are pizza buffets but why aren't there any meat buffets? Then it hit me! So my husband got people together and started the franchise. I didn't do anything! Geeze! KIM Hae-sook KIM Hee-ae That's the problem with women. KIM Hae-sook KIM Hee-ae KIM Hae-sook KIM Hee-ae Why's it all thanks to others? What about you? Why's it all thanks to others? What about you? That's why only men are presidents! And tycoons are all men with loud voices!! Why can't you say you made it and brag? Why are there no new members in our Women's Association? Look! Why are we the only female CEOs in all of Busan! - I'm right, aren't I? - Yes ma'am! Lunch is on me today. You can thank me. Fine, I'll speak up. I'm a woman, hear me roar! - How's that? - Is Ms. MOON Jung-sook here? Your company has violated the Prevention of Prostitution Act. What? - Let go! - Sit there, please. Mr. CHOI? What happened? Be quiet, please. A man died here! A Japanese man! I'd say if I knew, but I didn't know. How can the CEO not know? We can track your accounts. You want me to lie and say that I knew? Keep your voice down! I don't believe this! Go inside. Ms. MOON! You're pretty brave for a new worker. I'm sorry... We're very sorry, sir. We apologize, sir. We'll compensate for losses. We're very sorry. Please calm down, sir. We'll call again with more details, sir. Ms. MOON... It's my fault. I got shocked and reported it without thinking. I'm so sorry. I'll resign, ma'am. Stop crying. See to the bereaved family! Go apologize to the complaining customers. Hello? - Thank you. - What is it? Hello, ma'am. She's inside. Procuring prostitution? And a man died while doing it? How'd you get charged with something so nasty? I got stabbed in the back by a trusted employee. God is just. The Bible says, 'Boughs that bear most hang lowest. ' No, that's a proverb. Wanna die? Still feisty after serving time in jail, huh? - I'll let you off this time. - From what? - Thank you. - Have a nice day! Come soon! Not again. You always forget donation time. We 're donating to single mothers this month. Why leave me out? With your business suspended and compensations, you'll go broke. I own the top travel agency in Busan. I'll donate for sure! Bye. Wait! Don't hang up! How's Hye-Su? I went by the school and heard she was absent for 3 days. Did you know? I gotta go. You didn't, did you? Hello? - Why'd you skip school? - Who cares! I'm homeschooling! Why won't you go to school? Explain! I won't get mad. - There's no reason! - Get the key, please. - Why do you care all of a sudden!? - Throwing a tantrum won't help! If she hates it that much, just let her be. I'm her mom. The key, please! Open the door! COMFORT WOMEN VICTIM A woman revealed her ordeals as a comfort woman for the first time. COMFORT WOMEN VICTIM COMFORT WOMEN VICTIM Granny? More watermelon, please. Granny? More watermelon, please. Get it yourself. Don't trouble granny. Who cares! - Hye-Su! - What! It's okay. Stay there. What made you decide to reveal your story? I always thought it was unfair and wanted to seek justice. We had to follow the soldiers... Look at that granny. Bad things at your age ruined her whole life. This is an important time in your life. One false move could ruin your whole life. Stop whining and be thankful for what you have now. You're one fearsome person, Ms. MOON. Pardon? 'Children are gifts. I'm sorry, I quit. ' 'I don't need money. Thanks for everything. ' - Were you being rude again? - It's been 16 years. She saw everything. She cleaned and left without a word? She's scary. She just left a note and said she didn't need money. I'll find a new housekeeper for you. Words can't express everything. That granny's on again. It didn't matter if we were menstruating. Oh dear. They treated us like... Thank you! Come again! Our Women's Association should do something! Right? Whatever. Is anyone home? Hello? Ma'am? Oh my. Are you okay? Can you sit up? - What are you doing here? - What happened to your face? Why'd you come... Get up. Let's get you treated. Don't mind me. Who are you? Go Ms MOON! I'm fine. I'm taking her to the hospital. What? Why? Look at her face! Move over. - Just go! - What? Go before something happens! Hurry! Go! Stop it! Hello, police? Don't report my son! Get out! What in the world? Just go! Stop it. Calm down. Get lost! Get your dirty hands off me! Why aren't you eating? You don't like it? What do you like? I'll make it for dinner. Where's granny? She's not feeling well. Not feeling well? So suddenly? You can have it all by yourself. Oh my. Let's take a picture of us donating, please. Ready? One, two! That's good. We're sorry to make a racket, but we're happy to help. It's just the tip of the iceberg. With all these living victims, how can Japan keep denying it? That's why these testimonies are important. Most of them came from Seoul? From the countryside, too. But there's not enough people to visit everyone. Not enough volunteers? Busan is the second biggest city! Why can't Busan have a help center? There must be some grannies who can't go because Seoul is too far. That's right. - We should help out. - Why not? What's with you! Your agency's closed for 3 months. Let's open a call center there. I donated the most! Why should I? What's with you today? Where's your Joan of Arc attitude? It's just so unrelatable. Your agency is about to go under. So instead, open a call center for the victimized grannies there. - The publicity will help you! - Right! Then the prostitution ordeal will be wiped off clean! Great idea, huh? Fine. But just 3 months. Of course! We're busy too! My head! My head! There are bugs in my head! No! There are no bugs! It's okay! Stop it! Please! Stop! Stop it! COMFORT WOMEN & LABOR CAMP VICTIMS' CALL CENTER - Mister! - Yes? A little to the right, please! Be careful, sir! Neurosyphilis cannot be easily treated. And it's unfortunate that it developed past his 40s. It's amazing that you don't have it. Let's wait and see. What's my son watching? I love you more than anything in the world, you know? Try this. Come on. Eat it. Don't cry, son. Comfort Women Victims Call Center - Our ad is the biggest. - It's huge! Any calls? Not yet. It's only been a week. - Don't work too hard. - It's our job, ma'am. You really are amazing for doing something this meaningful. Really! - This huge ad, too. - I'm just offering the space. - Let's close up. - Yes, ma'am. Answer the phone. Hurry! Hello? Busan Women's Association Comfort Women Victims' Call Center... Yes. Hold please. Hello? It's over there. Granny SEO Gwi-soon? Yes? How much is all this? All of this? Looks so fresh! I'll tell you everything, but will my name be revealed? No need to worry about that. You have a bad cough. Maybe you should stop. I'd rather die than quit smoking. Oh my... Could you reconsider it? I can't. I'm sorry. Take care. Ow, my legs! Hello, Comfort Women... A call center at a place that ran prostitution tours? Shut up and stay low! We planned some new tours for next year. How about foreign language training and family tours? Ma'am! How've you been? Ms. MOON is in a meeting. Please wait. I heard that it will be anonymous. No one can ever know that I was here. Is that right? Yes, of course. What I'm most curious about is how much money I can get. I need money for surgery. That's my first priority... Go away, Ms. MOON. I'm not saying anything in front of you. They said I could become a nurse, so I wanted to go. I wanted to return home smarter. I wanted to become someone who can help out society. Why didn't you tell me? - We lived together for years... - Don't say anything. Ma'am! Just go, Ms. MOON. Leave me alone. Please. Leave me alone. I'll get you a taxi. Wait here. Leave me alone. After KIM's comfort women testimonies shocked the nation, the Busan Women's Association led by Ms. MOON, CEO of Daehan Travel Agency set up a call center in Busan for... What crazy woman would do such a thing? Pardon? And the grannies should be ashamed, too. How can they go on TV and say they sold their bodies? How can you say that? It's obvious they're just lying to get paid. Why would they lie about something like that? They're doing it to make money. It happened decades ago. Why bring it up now? Look. They hid in fear of being judged. What if she was your mom? How can you be so rude! What the hell! - Get out. - Are you insane! Get off now! Fine! You bastard! Damn bitch! So I bit his ear hard! Then he got mad and twisted my arm so hard! I bit down harder and blood gushed down his ear! Then he... he broke my arm! I screamed... Why is this month's donation so low? Most businesses in Busan deal with the Japanese. They heard about the donations. Business went down. How can the president say that? You'll be the same when you're back in business next month. This is serious. It's not like we can't live without their money! Business is all about expanding clients. And the call center is staying even after I reopen. Why? If our association doesn't help who would? If my business flops, will you feed my family? Yes, it's hurting our businesses! If you're scared, donate anonymously! The grannies need our help. Let's not be cheap, ladies. Are you okay? Yes, ma'am. Granny LEE Ok-joo? How've you been? - My daughter is here! - It's me, MOON Jung-sook. I bought you new shoes. Hello, Ms. MOON. Aunt Ok-joo? Remember them? I'm sorry she's always like this... It's okay. She can tell us another time. So pretty! - What's with you today? - Are you okay? How many panties are there, ma'am? Are they all yours? Your mother agreed to testify. Forget it! just go! Such an embarrassment! Mrs. HONG, I'm sorry about your struggles. It's amazing how you lived on. I have nothing more to say. Then I'll come next time. Take care, ma'am. This herbal medicine is for you, ma'am. Don't come again. Pardon? Don't come back! I'm not like the others. I became an owner later. Of a comfort station? I did what I could to survive the damn war. I lost all the money I made after liberation. As a woman too, didn't you feel sorry? You weren't born during the war and have never known hunger! How do you sleep after what you did? Let's go. Why you! Who reported me and brought back my damn past! Damn shitty bitches! Help me... Please! Mr. Mayor? What's taking so long? They qualify for welfare benefits. They need that to live and... Please stop asking me. It's being processed. Get the car. - You can't go till it's processed! - Damn. And the Comfort Women Memorial? Has that been approved? Please go. You promised you'd see to it! War Veterans' Widows Association are against the filthy women's statue. My hands are tied! Filthy women? - I mean... That's the public sentiment. - How can you say that! Oh my! Mr. Mayor! Settle down. - She's smoking! - Come back ma'am! Granny Soon-nyeo? Why do you smoke so often? - I'm frustrated. - Why? Word must've gotten out. The men at the senior home mumbled about me. So I flipped the game board over and left. I heard all kinds of things, too. That I'm yapping away with no fear of heaven. It scares me to hear that. Horrible people. But I'm not a comfort woman. Just because you went to the labor camp? Still, it's different. Ms. LEE Ok-joo, please. Are you okay? Why do you look so pale? You're so weak. Stop troubling Ms. MOON. Stop it! Are you okay? Granny can't come back. Things are hard for her, and she's sick. What are you doing? I'm not cut out to be a mom. But you said, it's irresponsible to say I'm not cut out to study. Right. It's all my fault. I didn't know it'd be so hard for you with granny gone. I'll try to do better. But the Japanese consulate dealt with us for 20 years! Many vendors are cancelling with us, too. They say you're anti-Japanese and won't work with us. Mr. ABE. How could you cancel 120 reservations with just a week left? I'll have no choice but to demand the cancellation fees. Let's just go on with it. We'll meet your demands. I saw the newspapers. I can't accept you blaming Japan without evidence. I'll pay the full cancellation fees. What about the grannies? Their testimonies are the proof! You trust what those old women say? They chose to sell their bodies when they were young. Now they're blaming us to get some pocket money! What? The war was a tragedy for the Japanese too. Not to mention the atomic bombs. What's more, we compensated the Korean government years ago. When will you people stop? What kind of shit is this? - Are you okay? - I'm fine. Shut down your damn call center! Go to hell, bitch! You're ruined! That bastard! I'm exhausted. What more do I have to do? No idea... Don't sleep here! Go home! How'd you know to run away from the start? You're so dang smart! You've done more than enough! . It's not like you'll sue Japan and get their apologies. The grannies should get $10 million each at the least! Just forget it. - It came. - Yes, yes. - Hold please. - It's from the Japanese lawyer. Hello? Yes. We will be landing in Fukuoka in about 30 minutes. LEE Sang-Il, A Lawyer Who Defends Pacific War Victims Pro Bono - Please calm down. - Pardon? You're too excited. Excitement doesn't last long. Time will tell if I'm excited or persistent. Are you rich? Don't you work pro Bono for war victims? Yes, but there's more to consider. The trial will be in Japan. The costs will be high. The grannies must come and go. Money problem is the easiest to solve. Money likes me. Don't worry. All I want is to win. Take a look. This matter has to be dealt with international law. But domestic law comes first in Japan. The problem is that there are no relevant laws within Japan. You mean we could lose? There's meaning in taking this to court. That's not enough! The grannies deserve to get apologies and compensations! Our goal should be raising international awareness. No! I must win! Fine. Even if we lose, I won't say anything. Please help us. I'll decide after meeting the grannies. It's a lawsuit without evidence. Their testimonies must be credible. What if we go to court then they make us pay for it later? People are good at betraying people. Right. Don't worry about money. The lawyers agreed to work for free and there is a support group. I'll cover all the traveling, food, and accommodations. Will we get some money if we win? Of course you will. But more than compensation... Imagine them kneeling before you! Wouldn't that be a sight? Those damn samurais won't say, it was their fault. Never. Someone I know sued someone once. It was so hard! She had to go to court for years. Then we have to go to a Japanese court ourselves? Yes! I don't even want to think about that. And everyone will know who we are if we testify in court. What if people point fingers? Right! The president should step up and do it. Not old grannies. - We can't do it. - Right! If I find a bug in my soup, I can't even complain. If they take my money, I just sulk. If people step on my foot, I apologize instead. But you're not like that, grannies! You were so brave to testify! You're way smarter than me. But if you don't go and sue them, it's so unfair. Win or lose, we should fight back! Right! Point fingers and ask them why they did that to you! You said you died back then. - Why are you scared? - Right! Right! Right! Right! I'm YAMAGUCHI Kenji. I'm HASHIMOTO Shinobu. I'm LEE Sang-Il. I'm LEE Ok-joo. Now, shall we begin? Only 3 ladies agreed to go to court. We won't blame you if you won't. But please take my calls. We're all worried. Read that for me? What is it? A DOLL IN THE FRONTLINES, TRAMPLED AT AGE 17 'I have nothing but the skin on my back.' 'If I die, who'd take interest in my miserable life?' 'Why couldn't I live life like everyone else?' 'I'm the victim and the witness.' KIM Hak-soon looks a lot like my friend. Who? Geum-bok. If she were alive, she would've stood up like that, too. She was a brave girl. But... Could I be brave like her? I'm not sure. It wasn't a house. Just a tent. Made of plastic. It was so cold. Many girls coughed up blood. You were in Nanjing for 5 years? Maybe 5 or 7 years... No one really knew what was going on there. Tell us more about how Col. MIYAZAKI helped you and your friend escape. I came back alone. But you said your friend came out, too. That's not what you said before. No, I didn't say that. You heard wrong. This is not good. - Shall we stop for today? - Yes. Thank you, ma'am. Ma'am? They came all the way from Japan to help us. - Could you... - Why should I be questioned? And by Japanese men? As the trial will be in Japan, we must work with Japanese lawyers. And Mr. LEE is an ethnic Korean. Seeing Japanese men disgusts me. Ma'am! - See you tomorrow. - Bye. Why aren't you eating? How can you eat? Why didn't you persuade her? Are you doing your job right? You need to relax. These trials take time. How can I when you're like this! Mr. CHOI... What? I worked half my life here! You call that severance pay? You got my agency suspended! I could sue you for damages. Be thankful you got paid at all! Besides the prostitution tour, why else would they visit Busan? Didn't you scout me knowing that? You were happy to earn more thanks to Mel . Let's go. I worked hard to revive your dying company! Now you treat me like shit? I trusted you! Is that a sin? You betrayed me! I didn't know! Even so, it's your responsibility. What? That's what CEOs must do. To hold legal and moral responsibilities. But he stained our reputation... - I didn't... - Wait. I'll be in touch. Ms. MOON? Please keep the prostitution tour a secret from the grannies. Wait! We need to talk. We've been struggling to find grounds to file suit. But we found it. Like you, it's about moral responsibility. What? May I? The preamble of the Japanese Constitution states the regrets in starting wars, and Japan's 'moral duty' to repair the damages. Compensating the grannies falls under here. But you said there was no relevant law. Right. But there's a precedent. From 1 978, Korean A-bomb survivors received free medical care from Japan. Although the case was before the Constitution was enacted, they accepted it under the 'duty of a moral nation.' So we can sue them within the Japanese Constitution? Yes! Also, it's important to note there is no 'current law' on this. The government did not legislate for apology, compensation, or indemnity. As such neglect constitutes a legislative omission, we seek an apology from the government, and compensation of $5.5 million. - Question! - Yes? Where are you going all dressed up, ma'ams? Your attention please. The temperature is 22 C and we 're travelling at 12 knots. We 'Il stop for 4 hours at Shimonoseki for immigrations. Take deep breaths. Oh dear. I'm okay. When will the announcements end? It's okay. You're so weak. Stop troubling Ms. MOON. Right. Wish I was too seasick and died on the ship to Saipan. Is that really Shimonoseki? It changed so much. I was dragged here at 14. Now I'm back as a granny. Oh dear. Hello, grannies. How are you? Hello, I'm HANABUSA Emiko. Greet our trusty supporters from Fukuoka. Welcome to... It's okay. Thank you. - Let me get that for you. - Let's go. - Let's go! Let's go! - Watch your step. Here they come! How do you feel now? Cheer up grannies! They all came to see us? Yes. With more spectators, it puts pressure on the court. It's important to have many people out here. See? We're not alone. Do you expect to win against the Japanese government? THE 1st HEARING All rise! Be seated! Comfort women and labor camp victims of Busan versus Japan case. The first hearing will now commence. Your Honor? Before we begin, I have an objection. Before we even begin? I object to the dismissal of the plaintiffs' supporter. The plaintiffs need help in moving and don't speak Japanese. As it is their first trial, I reapply for the supporter to stay. The supporter's interpretation may interfere with the trial. There is a court interpreter for the proceedings. Your request is denied. - What the hell are they saying? - I'm not sure... Plaintiffs, please remain quiet. It's contempt of court. Gwi-soon, you know Japanese. But this is hard. Silence now. Or court will be adjourned. How frustrating! Isn't this our trial? Ms. MOON? Come quick! Please stay seated! Is the supporter here? Yes. Please come forward. The judge asks you to remain quiet. Let's be quiet to speed things up. Okay. Plaintiffs' counsel, make your opening statement. Where we stand now, many Japanese who have died for our country lay asleep. But we must remember that there are also others who died wrongfully and unjustly. Although Japan should first give apology and compensate, victims have been neglected and ignored for half a century. This trial is the result of the great divide that has formed. The plaintiffs revealed themselves and have come here to appeal. What does that mean? As they have broken their silence and stepped forward, history must not be overlooked or forgotten. Thus, to expedite the recognition of facts in this lawsuit, we request the defendant government to promptly submit the evidence and seek to find the legislation that should exist. Yes! Hear! Hear! That's right! What a fine young man. I wish he was my son. No way. He's my son. It must be nice for you, Jung-Gil. You have a grown son. Order in the court. Defense, make your statement. The defendant, Japanese government, greatly regrets the plaintiffs' hardships. However, this issue was finalized in the Korea-Japan Treaty of 1965. There is no legal basis for individuals to claim post-war compensation against the state. Thus, this case should not be dealt with in court. In 1 965, Japan hid its involvement in the provisions of 'comfort women.' Also, it was an economic treaty, and human rights issues were excluded. Though there was no contention to compensate victims, individuals' claims can be made! Defense? Do you wish to comment? No, Your Honor. The next hearing will be on December 13th at 1:30 pm. The plaintiffs should prepare to testify. It's over already? After pushing the trial off for months, they just make us sit here? - I'm hungry. Let's eat. - Not now. Can I just rest and not take a bath? The hot spring will help relieve stress and tension. I've never been to a public bath. Don't be shy. It's just us. - But... - Let's go in. You almost gave me a heart attack, girlie. JOSEON PUSSY What's JOSEON pussy? Forget it. Let's go! What's the matter? Of course, they're shocked. Where else would they see this? What happened to your stomach? The assholes did it, of course. I got pregnant and didn't know. When my stomach got bigger, they cut it open. Then they took the fetus out and threw it on the ground. I fainted on the spot. If they just took out the baby, I would've had kids and lived well. But they took out my womb, too. I didn't know and tried everything to have a baby. That's my biggest regret. Those shitty bastards! Ms. MOON? You know how to curse? Do it again. You motherfuckers! Cut the bullshit you dumb shits! I'll pull your tongues out, you good for nothing losers! Or I'll pull your heads off and stick 'em on a watermill! Go dizzy and die! How dare you strike stakes on the grannies' hearts? If I catch you, I'll kick your badass to hell! You dickheads! That felt good! I'm so sorry. We can't have you stay tonight. Was there a mistake in our reservation? Something came up. Please understand. Is there another place? It'll probably be the same elsewhere. Is there a problem? I'm very sorry. Our guests say they do not want to share the baths or the blankets they've used... What? I'm sorry, but it's for the business. Please understand. What in the world? Ms. MOON. Calm down, please. Mr. LEE! I can't just go like this! We can't keep the grannies waiting. Grannies? There's no room here. Let's go somewhere else. Welcome. Good evening. She's my mother. Thank you for your help. Welcome. Are you okay? Stick 'em on the watermill! Don't sleep! May I? You smoke, Ms. MOON? I haven't smoked in a while. I thought it'd be over soon, but it's been a year. It's physically challenging. The grannies' testimonies will be important from now on. - Welcome back, ma'am. - Hi. Here's the press kit sample. - The visas? - Not yet, ma'am. Still? It should only take a week. The trial is coming up. Get them now. Yes, ma'am. Your company is a mess! You wanna ruin it? It won't be ruined as long as I'm here. Once the trial is over, we can recover. When will it end? Ever seen me fail at anything? It'll be over soon. Is Hye-Su really quitting school? You call yourself a mom? Don't lecture me! Just because your kid tops in school! You think Hye-Su really wants to quit school? She's doing it to get attention from her workaholic mom! But that's who I am. I love working. I can't pretend to be someone I'm not. I'm so dizzy! Why do they call us over once every six months? They're waiting for us to die, aren't they? They must not know how tenacious we are. Let's show them. It's better than a ship, isn't it? Try the free drinks. - I'm getting off to smoke. - No! You can't! Okay, okay. Stop with your filthy lies! Don't anger our great Emperor! The Japanese Empire has no time to listen to your lies! - Shame on you! - Where's your conscience! The media should report on their lies! What is the context of your testimony today? Go home, filthy grannies! - Please move! - Stop asking for money! Get off our land, you prostitutes! Speak calmly as you practiced. And no swearing, okay? Don't worry. THE 3rd HEARING Rotten bastards! I was mutilated down there from all the attacks! You hear me? Are you listening? When I was too swollen to even poke a needle in, they shouted, 'Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!' then stabbed nails in me! Damn samurai bastards! They couldn't have done that if they thought of us as humans! Trapped in a room like a pigsty, I faced dozens of soldiers a day. I couldn't even go out because they always stood guard. They threw in tiny rice balls for food. They violated me even as I ate. I almost starved to death! We had to use cans as toilets. We were treated worse than insects! They couldn't have done that if they thought of us as humans! Even if I kill all you damn samurais, I won't forgive! You assholes! Even if I kill all you Japanese, I won't forgive! You fucking assholes. Please control your emotions in interpreting. All I did was convey the plaintiff's statement vividly! The plaintiff's emotions are getting across. Defense, examine the witness. - We have no questions, Your Honor. - Very well. The next hearing will be on June 24th at 3:30 pm. You bastards! I, PARK Soon-nyeo, survived that hell! You're scared I'm alive, aren't you! With cigarettes, I can last 100 years! You Samurai fuckers! Right! I practiced so hard, but didn't get to say much at all. How can the prosecutors not say a word? I just wanted to twist their necks and yank 'em off! How can it be just 8 minutes! I'm so mad I can't breathe! Damn it! They'll continue to make no action. Still, you yelled your head off at them. I felt so relieved! Really? But Ms. MOON was louder than me! Was I? That's right! She looks happy too. - Someone sing a tune. - Yes! Our collar badges are like cherry blossoms in full bloom Blossoms that encounter storms in Yoshino mountaintops If you were born a Japanese man, it's your destiny to fall like blossoms in the FRONTLINES Isn't that a military song? Who cares as long as the grannies are happy. We can't win by cursing at them. The judge is a man too. He won't like being cursed at. Didn't you say the trial itself is meaningful? Blossoms that encounter storms in Yoshino mountaintops If you were born a Japanese man, it's your destiny to fall like blossoms in the FRONTLINES What is this? We brought blankets! Now, give us our rooms. Blankets? This is my favorite blanket. It's so nice and fluffy. Ma'am? What? Nothing. Why you... It's amazing how you handle everything on your own. Though my husband beat me, I couldn't think of leaving him. I thought how could a dumb, unlucky girl like me live alone? I couldn't have lived without you. How's Hye-Su doing? - She's all grown up now. - No way. I was her age when I was dragged off. I was just a kid who knew nothing. She always says she'll quit school and stuff. Did you tell her about me? No. She's still young. You said she's grown up. Quiet down! Go see her if you miss her. Yes, go! Right! I wanna go too! Good night! Girls! Quiet down! Attention! As I mentioned before, we have a special guest today. Give her a big hand! Comfort Women Victim Guest Speaker I... I thought I didn't have any tears left in me... But seeing you girls, it reminds me of when I was young. It hurts so much. - Granny! You're pretty! - You're beautiful! Granny, you're pretty! You're beautiful! Thank you very much. You're all pretty too. It's true! Don't cry, granny! What about me? You're beautiful too! Where are you going all dressed up, ma'ams? To Japan. Really? To see the Sakura? For a trial. What trial is that? Comfort women trial. Comfort women trial? Right! Comfort women trial. Labor camp trial for me. What? - Stop staring fool! - Ma'am! Watch the road! Yes, ma'am. Don't get us killed! I'm sorry, ma'am. We're representatives of a national team. - Understood? - That's right. - Yes, I won't forget it. - Right! Let's go. Everyone's waiting. Officer! What's with you? I'm not going! I want to go home! You must testify! I didn't do anything wrong! I don't want to go! You didn't do anything wrong. Let's go punish those who hurt you. I know you'll take me far away and abandon me! Is something wrong? It's okay. Ok-joo! Wanna go see the flowers? Your favorite peach blossoms are in full bloom there. You look so pretty today, Ok-joo! - Flowers? - Come with us! Where was your hometown? THE 6th HEARING Where was your hometown? THE 6th HEARING THE 6th HEARING It was Dohwa village where pretty peach blossoms grew. It was Dohwa village where pretty peach blossoms grew. People said I was pretty like a peach blossom. What were you doing when you were dragged away? What happened before you were dragged away? Dragged away? About the new shoes, remember? New shoes! Dad bought me new shoes with blossoms on them. He put them in my hands. Then he said my brother must stay to carry on the family line. He said sorry and cried. I said it was okay. I said sorry for not making feed for our cow before I go. I followed officers on a train and ship. I got sick and threw up everything. What happened when you arrived? What happened when... Wait! Where am I? Granny? Ma'am? Granny! Stop it! Stop! Plaintiff! Take your seat! Granny! Will I get smart by getting the compensation? Still, I want to get it and buy pretty clothes. And I want to buy pills to fix my brain! Compensate me or I'll die! I'll cut my neck right in front of you! Compensate me or I'll die! I'll cut my neck in front of you! Return to your seats! - I'm so sorry sir. - Granny. Don't hit me! - My head hurts! It hurts! - Help? Anybody! Don't hit me! Stop! - Don't hit my head! - Call the ambulance! Dad! Ok-joo! Someone call a doctor! Objection! The plaintiff has dementia. Her testimony is not credible. She is just confused sir! Supporter! Just translate! She's right! Though she suffers from the effects of assault at the comfort station, her memories from then are intact. Rather, she remembers it more clearly than anyone. Please refer to a specialist's assessment. I will, but can the plaintiff continue to testify? Not today, Your Honor. The protest continued today. The Pacific War victims' bereaved families demonstrated outside the Japanese embassy in Seoul for the immediate dismissal of Minister NA GANO for... That's because NAGANO said comfort women were prostitutes. Aren't you going to fight back? Damn asshole. Virgins were victims, but prostitutes weren't? No, they suffered the same. Still, how can I go to the trial? I was ignorant before. I'm very sorry. Nonsense. So with all your help, did the world change? The world may not, but we will. It's good. We got a reply from the defense. As the grannies' statements were inconsistent and with no evidence, it says they have no value. Those bastards! After being silent in court? This is the cold, hard truth. We've had social repercussions, but no legal evidence. We'll file a suit against Nagano for libel. But I'm worried that it’ll just end as a political gesture, too. How about appealing to people's consciences? Advertise in Japanese newspapers that we need people to testify? Great idea! But that's incredibly expensive. Come on. I can afford that! Another $10,000? Again? I'm sorry, but help me! I really can't this time. I'm under audit. We're about to flop tool ,. Now we have 10 grannies who want to file suit. You'll look after all 10? Are you out of your mind? How much is feeding 10 people one meal in Japan? You're renting your house now! What if you end up on the streets? Stop shoveling sand against the tide! This is hopeless! - Just go! - What's with you! Why are you so obsessed with the grannies? Wanna run for mayor? I'm ashamed! That I lived well when they didn't! Or rather... We didn't win yet. We have to keep fighting. Right? You're deranged. You can't be fixed. You're out of your mind. Gross! You crazy? You're insane! Stay back! - I love you! - You lost your mind! Get away from Mel . Stop crying! It won't do anything good! I know, but if I think about then... Ms. MOON? It's the lawyer. The money paid off! We got a Japanese witness! Really? Who? The teacher who sent granny SEO to labor camp. Could you come here? How about a massage? Would you reconsider? I'm sorry. I don't want to make a fuss by testifying. I just want to apologize to SEO Gwi-soon. I'm sorry. Will you at least come to the hearing? I'm sorry. Ms. SUGIMURA. I beg you. I'm sorry. THE 11th HEARING I went on a train from Seoul to Busan, then got on a ferry. When I arrived in Shimonoseki, they put me on a truck. It took me to Fujikoshi Factory in Toyama. What did you do at the factory? I cut 6,000 bullets a day with a lathe. Later, I put filaments in light bulbs. Was life at labor camp difficult? It was hell. Working day and night, I was sleepy and hungry. Once, I got caught and beaten for eating parsley from the yard. How much were you paid? They said they'd pay me later, but I didn't see a penny. Besides that... Plaintiff! What are you doing? One day, they called out a dozen of us and took us away on a truck. We were so happy to get an outing. They put us in a big hall. Then soldiers came in. They chose a girl each and left. That happened again and again. What happened? Because I wouldn't listen, they cut me up and played with me. Even as blood gushed out... They spread my legs and shoved it in. My back still hurts from that. - Cover your filthy body! - She's just a prostitute! - Don't you have hearts? - Order in the court! Your Honor! Take a look, sir. The plaintiffs still feel the pain. Please heal their 50 year-long pain through this court! I will reveal everything. Gwi-soon. On July 2nd, 1944, you sent 5 out of 70 of your grade 6 students, and another student on February 25th to the labor camp. Is that true? Yes. As the vice-principal said, I advised smart students to go. A child going far away alone to a factory like Toyama, didn't you think it was harsh? Well, the film showed it had a library, cafeteria, and hospital. You thought the factory was good after watching its propaganda film? That is what I thought. That's a lie! She knew! Silence! Did you think the film was real? So! Did you persuade the parents who begged their children to stay at least till their graduation? It is not to punish the witness. Please answer honestly. I found out later that the factory was a lie and how horrible it was. What did you do then? I argued that the children should be brought back. But it was too late. I didn't know how to bring them back. The only thing I could do was quitting the school. Is it true that you weren't active in trying to bring them back? Over the course of 50 years, I felt guilty. So guilty that I couldn't even look west towards Korea. Did you know that the plaintiff had to work as a comfort woman? I swear I didn't know that. If I knew, I couldn't have lived on. I want to apologize even if it's too late. Gwi-soon, I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. That is all. - You're a shame to Japan! - How much did they pay you! - Stop it! - How can you say that? I'm so sorry. You knew that about granny SEO and didn't tell me? And why did you make her testify like that? They reconciled and we presented a decisive testimony. What's the problem? The process can hurt! You're no different from them! Is winning all you care about? We must win. Or else why go through all this trouble? Is winning everything? Is the winner always right? That means our grannies were taken because they're weak? The bastards were winners then! Then why the trial? They just lost to the winners. You disgust me, Ms. MOON. The Japanese government should apologize at once! The Japanese government should accept the fault! You're amazing, Gwi-soon. I'd rather die than to forgive. If they apologize like that, I'd be happy too. Living with hatred is hard. What do you think you're doing here? There's a school here! What's wrong with a peaceful protest! Shut up and leave! You whores! JOSEON fools! Get him! Stupid bastards! Move! I'LL KILL YOU! I'm hungry. Welcome back. - What's that? - Mom, I'll do it. It happens often. Go inside and rest. - Sang-Il! Here. - Thanks Mom. I'm a woman with money, but why are you doing this for free? My elementary school report card graded me on 'patriotism.' - Patriotism? - Yes. Mom protested and eventually had it deleted. I realized life wasn't going to be easy like this. We had to fight for our rights. But I never blamed my parents for being born an ethnic Korean. I just hated the discrimination and injustice. So, here I am. Did you describe the brothel as your lawyer had submitted? I'm not sure. Just say 'yes' to things like that. Okay. Tell me about Mr. MIYAZAKI. MIYAZAKI... He was a three-star colonel. Did he send you home? I was sick and dying... So he wrote a permit for me. Were you and MIYAZAKI lovers? Can we not talk about that? Why? You talked about it before. That was between you and me. I can't talk about that in the trial. But stating special details is most important in testifying. Come on! Take a break. Mom, stop cramming her. Go easy on her. Aren't you late for work? We won't starve because I'm off one day. Granny? Wanna practice with me? Let's see. MIYAZAKI? Was he nice to you? Maybe you were right, Ms. MOON. Repercussions of the last trial have raised our position. Maybe that's why the government is pushing hard for private funds. Trying to play down the testimonies? How about visiting the comfort stations? For granny BAE's testimony? Well... It will definitely help our case. Are you still against it? NANJING, CHINA The granny from Tongyeong would've loved a visitor from home. She missed Tongyeong till the day she died. There weren't many girls who came from Tongyeong. She loved singing 'Hakata Night Boat.' 'Hakata Night Boat?' Don't you sing that all the time? Right? Really? Maybe you know her. Geum-bok... Not many people know that song. I think it was a restaurant. It was empty and in ruins when we arrived. It was all covered in blood. They told us to wash off the bloodstains. There were corpses at the back. If we didn't remove them, we'd get no food. So, Geum-bok and I grabbed the corpses and moved them. That's how we met. Then the soldiers made stalls. Here... There were rooms for us. We moved from place to place with the soldiers. We don't know how many years went by. But Geum-bok and I stuck together. If we didn't, I would've died long ago. Once, we hoped soldiers won't touch us if we got sick. So Geum-bok and I didn't put condoms on them. But then, some pest-like discharge came out. Then they struck us with Salvarsan needles for syphilis. It left an awful taste in our mouths! If injected wrong, it rotted the veins! I was fine, but Geum-bok... Geum-bok's arm rotted black. If you can't be cured, you'd get shot. To survive... she... She asked me to cut off her rotten flesh. She was desperate to live. THE 15th HEARING What were you called at the comfort station? They called us 'JOSEON Pussy.' I couldn't stand it. I hated hearing that more than death. I hated hearing 'JOSEON Pussy' more than death. What else would they call them! Stop it! - JOSEON Pussy! Chinese Pussy! - Order in the court! How did you get married? As I struggled to live on, someone introduced me to an elderly man and we got married. Could you explain further? Is that when you had your son? Yes. Heaven helped me have a beautiful baby. I was so happy. But... A terrible germ was passed on to him. Are you referring to syphilis? Yes. That is all. Defense? Your witness? I received the plaintiff's medical files. However, I found some discrepancies with her testimony. There are some differences with your testimony? Seeing this will prove that the plaintiff is a shameless liar. Your Honor, he is insulting the plaintiff! Defense, adhere to your statement. According to this record the plaintiff has never given birth. Thus, he is not her real son. Koreans are good at lying! Fools! It's over for you now! What happened, supporters? Silence! Soon-mo is not your son? How could you do this? Why didn't you tell us? I didn't lie. It's all true. You ruined everything! Everything we've done for 4 years is ruined because you lied! The Asian Women's Fund was established last year. The officials stated that they had compensated $20, 000 each for Filipino comfort women victims. Way to go mom. We're not bums! The damn samurai fools didn't kneel! Think we'd settle for peanuts? - They're crazy! - Right. Still, we worked hard for it. I'm going to take it to get my knee surgery. Are you out of your mind? Stupid! What? I'm not taking it either. How long will we live? I'm not dying till I get their apologies. Are you sick, Ms. MOON? Why are you quiet? She even sold women for money. Why ask her? Right. What do you mean? Didn't you hear about the prostitution tour? I heard she'll do anything for money. What? Is that true? She didn't know. A manager did it. Yes, it was a shame. I didn't know, but I'm still responsible. I think the compensation is entirely up to you to decide. Though it has political and historical significance, your happiness means more to us than anything. I'll wait for you to decide. - Right! - I'm taking the money. Where's her victim certificate? She'll take the compensation? Who cares? Just give me her certificate. I'm asking if that's what your mother wants! I'm a victim too you know! Let's cancel the hearing. She wants the money, and has no will to sue. In things like this, a step forward means success. It's a very slow and long process. I guess I put my foot in the wrong place. Cheer up, Ms. MOON. The next report is on a terribly sad loss. Another granny with a tragically hard life has passed away. Until recently, she battled the Japanese government... It's my fault. I told her it'll help the case if she revealed everything. I pushed her to bring up old wounds. She died early because of me. I'm sorry to you, too. I was wrong. Take the money. Forget the trial. Move on and be happy. Stop sulking. Move over. You're all grown up. Yes, I grew up well by myself. Hye-Su? Forget it. Don't ever regret it. No! I don't regret it Good! That's my mom! I brought bread from work. Want some? Sure! Let's eat. What should we eat? Write your name under 'proxy' then stamp it, please. When will the money come in? When will he be paid? It will be paid by the end of August. I'll get the money for sure? Yes, of course. Forget this damn paper! I want my apology! What damn apology! It won't change anything! Please stop! Nothing will change! I got donations for the grannies who didn't take the compensation. The funeral must have cost a lot, too. Cheer up, Jung-sook! Let's see if you're still kicking. What's with you! Your mother decided to testify. So? Won't you come with us? Why would I? It's a lost cause. It'd be nice to win. But I learned that the world is not about winning and losing. You said you were a victim, too. This trial is not just for her, but for you, too. THE 20th HEARING Is it the friend with the same tattoo as yours? Yes. When Geum-bok was about to die after giving birth, MIYAZAKI said he'd send her back home. Then Geum-bok begged him to send me back, too. We swore to stay together no matter what. At last, we got the permit and got on a train. Travelling for days on the train, the baby couldn't sleep and kept crying. That night, I walked around the train to soothe him. When I came back, soldiers were dragging Geum-bok away. I was the one holding the baby, so they let me go. They arrested Geum-bok instead. I wanted to say the baby wasn't mine, but Geum-bok pretended not to know me. She wanted me to live. She didn't even look at the baby, then turned to go. I was so scared then. I couldn't even call after her. I was afraid to be dragged into that hell again. I felt so guilty towards her... So I decided to raise the baby well. But my son inherited a terrible disease. And if he found out who his father was, I thought he'd go crazy. That's why I kept it a secret until now. I blamed myself a million times. It should've been Geum-bok who survived and raised her son. But during the last 5 years of this trial, I realized it wasn't a sin. I just did what I could to survive in that hell. And I survived. That is all. What a terrible tragedy. When her friend was taken away, she took care of her son for life. She hid the truth for fear of hurting her son. But the defense used that against her and insulted her as a liar. However, what she concealed proves that she was a comfort woman! It is evidence that proves she was a victim! Right! Apologize to her! When this is all over, let's go eat noodles. Why pay when I can make 'em for you? I came all the way here and can't even eat out with my mom? Right. Looking back on your life, how do you feel? How do you feel now? I was taken away at 17 and lived in hell. I'm still living in that hell. Even if they give me all of Japan, I don't want it! There's only one thing I want. Me! Give me back my youth! Take me back to when I was 17! I know that can't be done, so apologize. You may try to hide it, but it shows. It's no use feeling sorry on the inside. Say you were wrong! Ask for forgiveness! Say you'll never do it again and act like humans! So there'll be no more war, and girls will not be trampled on! I'll give you a chance now to be humans. Seeing the grandmothers and their history, I feel like they're like walking museums. So we should make 'herstory' - instead of 'history' known. - I'm proud of Hye-Su! It's so hot! The sentencing hearing is coming up soon. Time flies. If we lose, I'll be so mad I could die. However, THE SENTENCING this took place before the Constitution was enacted. This took place before the Constitution was enacted. Also, from the preamble of the Constitution, the plaintiffs' claim of 'duty of a moral nation' does not include direct apology and compensation to victims of colonial rule. - That's right! - No way! They can't apologize and compensate. However, the comfort women system clearly discriminated against women and other races. It violated women's dignity and rights as well as their ethnic pride. Rather than a problem of the past, it's a human rights issue to overcome even today. It's an infringement of basic rights set in Article 1 3 of the Constitution. - We won! - That's unacceptable! He says they violated basic rights. That's good! A ruling that acknowledges the Japanese government's responsibility towards the comfort women has been made for the first time. Here's the report from Tokyo. The judge in the Shimonoseki Branch ruled partially in favor of the plaintiffs today. Nevertheless, the government did not fulfill obligations and the plaintiffs suffered harm. Therefore, the defendant nation shall pay $3,000 to each plaintiff. However, an official apology is deemed unnecessary. What? Right! No apology! It's a wrongful ruling! - Be quiet! - Stop avoiding responsibility! Look. I don't need $3,000. Go stuff yourselves! You fools will never understand human talk. Let's all go. It's not worth hearing. You can have it! $3, 000! That's too much for them! - You call yourselves humans? - Get lost! Also, compared to the comfort women, the labor plaintiffs' rights complaints are not serious human rights violations. Thus, no labor contract is constituted. There is no obligation to pay wages. Going to Japan 23 times over 6 years, I was able to continue on with the tedious trial thanks to the Fukuoka Supporters' Association and the 150 plus civic groups here. And if it weren't for our first 3 lawyers, we couldn't have started the lawsuit. I thank all of our 13 lawyers. I can't thank you enough. These great ladies gave me so much more than I could ever give. To granny BAE Jung-Gil, PARK Soon-nyeo, LEE Ok-joo, and SEO Gwi-soon who passed away... I love seeing our grannies' wrinkled, happy faces. To see them smile brightly, we came all this way... Grannies... I'm sorry we couldn't win completely. We are very sorry, grannies. Oh my! It's okay. If it wasn't for you, we'd never have met these people. Cut the chit-chat and sing a song! Sing a song! Sing a song! Cheer up everyone! Though we lost the lawsuit, I'm okay I may be trampled many times, but I will not break All of you here today Listen to me please! Don't start a war ever again Wake up you foolish leaders Though I die years from now or even tomorrow, I don't care! I'll say what I want! The plaintiffs' struggle for over 6 years shook the judges' conscience. It led to the first and only partial victory of compensation for the comfort women victims. However, the judges were soon replaced and the Japanese government appealed. After 5 years of trial in 2003, the Supreme Court dismissed the ruling. Come on in. Right this way. What are you up to this time? I'll make a museum to make your history known. Educate the world so it doesn't happen again. We didn't get an apology or win the case. Right. Still, we can't say we lost. Right. We didn't win or lose. Let's just say it's not over yet. Because it's not over till it's over. Right! On April 4th, 20 17, the last plaintiff passed away. Ready? One, two! The plaintiffs' representative is still working on registering the court records with UNESCO.
