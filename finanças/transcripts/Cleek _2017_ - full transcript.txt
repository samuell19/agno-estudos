- Police say they are becoming increasing concerned for the safety of a vulnerable missing woman from Latnum. - Three fire engines, police officers and even a water rescue team were called out to look. - Top story today, police and fire crews were called out to search for a missing person that in one report wore a pair of trainers and a backpack near Latnum graves. - Police are still searching for a student who sparked a missing person's inquiry when she failed to turn up at her parents on Christmas day. Joan Brice's worried mother booked her missing when she did not arrive at her family home on December the 23rd. - Detective inspector Allen from the Glasgow area said, "We're currently "liaising with the local community in attempt "to locate the missing youth, but anyone who "hasn't seen Stephanie or knows her whereabouts "to call us as soon as possible." - Did you know her, the missing woman? - Yes, not very well, but I'm doing my part. - Good, there's that many people going missing these days, and no one seems to really give a shit. - Humanity's in a rush. Nobody has any time for anyone except themselves. - Well I hope she shows up. - Good morning, I'm Jacob. I'm a friend of Sams. - Lisa. - Coffee? - No thanks. I've gotta go. - Ta-da. - Breakfast, the most important meal of the day. - It's not just any breakfast. This is a cowboy breakfast. I wolf down one of these every single day. - Too bad I've already eaten. - Aye well you need to bus soon. I've got company comin' over. - Didn't your company just leave? - What you think she's company? Wait till you see what I've got coming around later. - Maybe you ought to settle down. - Fuck. Fuck, that's her. You sure you don't want it in a wee doggie bag? - No, maybe your guest'll want it. - Come here. With a bit of luck, she'll be feasting on something else. - Charmin'. I'll use the back door. - We're all here because we have a problem, and we need to solve our problem before it drains the life out of us. You can call it what you want, an addiction, a fixation, a demon. But what it is is an enslavement, one of craving and compulsion. And if you let it, it'll drag you even deeper into despair. Let's open up to you. Scott please. - My name's Scott, and I'm addict. I haven't had a drink for about five months. Who am I tryin' to kid, about five months? It's been four months and 26 days. I know this because like everyone else here I'll never forget my last drop. And thanks to the people in this very room and the support of my loving wife, I'm gonna stay clean. Thanks. - Jacob. - My name's Jacob, and I'm an addict. That's all I have to say. - You've been coming here awhile now, maybe give it some push. - Some push? - Just a wee bit. I'm your sponsor. You need to trust me. - My name is Jacob, and I'm an addict. I know that when I let it take over I become powerless. And like our great speaker said, we have a problem. But that problem binds us, brings us together. That problem gives us a place to tell the tales that make us who we are. - Not bad. - Thank you Russell. - My name is Rodger, and I'm an alcoholic. - Do you mind if I ask you a couple questions? - Not at all. - When was the last time you saw healthy Jackie. - At the last meeting. - Thank you. - The night before she went missing. - That's what Raymond said. - Hi my name's Frank. I'm an alcoholic. - It just doesn't make sense. She wouldn't just up and disappear like that. - Russell, do you mind if I say something without you taking offense? - Called me a drunk, and said I needed help. - You didn't really know Jackie that well. She'd only been coming here a couple of months, and the last time she was seen she was in a pub. What does that tell you? - It tells me nothing. Lots of alcoholics go in pubs and clubs, it doesn't mean they're drinking. You run that bar for Christ's sake. - But I'm going to prove 'em wrong. - Russell you're not a policeman anymore. This isn't your case. All we can do is hand out fliers and help with the search. - Ridiculous. Somebody must know something. - Russell, you became an alcoholic because of your job. - So? - Forgive me for only thinking about myself, but I don't want my sponsor, my support to be delving into bad habits and old lifestyles. It could be bad for both of us. - A search has been launched for a woman who's been reported missing from her home on the South side of Glasgow. 32 year old Jacqueline Crawford was last seen outside Murray's Bar on Shuttle Lane at around two p.m. on Tuesday the third of January. Miss Crawford's colleagues raised the alarm-- - Tell me something. - When she failed to turn up at work the following day. - What kind of a man does not drink, works in a pub, huh? - The family who live on the same street as Jacqueline. - Who says I don't drink? - Don't talk pish. I've seen you at those AA meetings. - Funny, I've not seen you there. - Aye, well I've seen you leaving them. - Just because I attend those meetings doesn't mean I don't drink. Just means I don't like drinking problem unlike yourself. - Oh, touche barman. - Her friend Antony spoke about the search. - Paul, Tuesday? - On you go? - Warn somebody, anybody, we're just all worried. - Jacqueline Carwford is described and being-- - Oh and by the way, I do not have a drinking problem. That's why you don't see me at those daft meetings you go to, huh? - I guess you won't want another then? - Don't be daft. Fill 'er up. - You look like a man that could afford this. - Excuse me? - I'll make it worth your while. - Don't you mean you'll make it worth my money? - Aye, that too. - Maybe some other time. Are you hungry? - Why are you helping me? - Helping others gives me peace. - Jacob, let me in. I need to talk to you. - Do you want me to leave? - Not at all. - Good evening, Russell. Please come in. - Strange company to be keeping this time of night. She's a mess. - You don't exactly look great yourself. - Do you recognize this woman? Her name's Debra Allen. She went missing three years ago. This was the last case I was working when things went bad, and I turned to drink. I lost my partner and my job. - Can't say that I do. Look Russell, why are you telling me this? - I was thinking about what you said the other day. And I don't think I can be your sponsor. Look every time there's a serious crime in this town, it brings me right back to this. And now that Jackie's been AWOL, my mind's just not in it. - I understand. You know we all lose it from time to time. - I don't know. Look Bill, just let me step up to the plate, maybe he can be your sponsor. - Maybe. - Glad to see there's only one glass of wine poured. That better be for your guest. - Of course. You need to leave, now! What's your name? - Teresa. - Okay Teresa, I'm interested to see what you can do for me. - I can do a lot of things. - I bet you can, but not here, at my house. Meet me around the corner in five minutes, understood? - Okay. So what's first bed, floor, couch? - How 'bout a drink? - Oh wine, fancy. - Nothing but the best. - Tough day? - Pour one. - Sam? Work or the miss, hmm? - Family. I've worked my balls off all day just so I could see the kids tonight. Do you know what she's doing? She's taking them curling. Curling. What do you need that do you know's out there curling? I swear she's doing all she can to stop me seeing those kids. - Surely if you want to spend time with them, and she's taking them out tonight, the wise thing would be for you to buy a ticket. - You're a genius. - I can nip back and get changed and make it in an hour. - Come on. - Tell me is it a curling game or a curling match. Do you know? - Match I believe, but don't quote me. - Stacy, Stacy, what's the matter with you? You're not fun to be around like last night. - Oh don't act like the big man, Richard. It's not my fault you couldn't get it up last night. - Oh, you! What do you think you're doing hitting a woman, huh? - Fuck off, or I'll do worse to you. - Aye, well come ahead then. Fucking hell! Fuck! - I'll see you again. - Fuck. Thanks for the backup. - I don't have the stomach for violence. What could that have possibly achieved? - Aye well, so where can I get a curling ticket around here then eh? - Police have made a brand new appeal for help in locating Jacqueline Crawford who has been missing for two weeks. Jacqueline, 32, has not been seen since Tuesday the third of January when she left the bar on Shuttle Lane. The latest appeal came when family and friends sent out search parties and asked for support in finding their loved one. Jacqueline Crawford is described as slim build, five foot six, and she's tall with long brown hair. - It's been great seeing you. - Take whatever you want. - Oh, no, no, no, it's not your money we want, love. - If it was, we wouldn't even be here with some sanky homeless bitch. - Oh mate, this is none of your business, so piss off. I mean it I'll fuck you up. - You're welcome to try, and you'll probably succeed, but one of you will end up with this across your face. The question is who will it be. - Come on. It's not worth it. Come on, I've dealt with this asshole before. Let's go. - Jacob? Jacob Cleek? It's me, Norma. - Feel better? - Yeah, thanks for the shower. I hope I'm not keeping you from anything. - No. I usually have an art thing on a Tuesday, but it's nothing. So how did you become-- - Homeless? - Unsettled. - You know me, mom was a drunk, loved the men. - As did you. - Ouch. And when I'm told to do something, I do the opposite. So when she tried to ground me at 16, I left and went to Ireland. - Why Ireland? - Why not? Anyway, a guy become my boyfriend. Moved in with boyfriend. Boyfriend was a junkie. Junkie got jailed, now he's left paying less than them, ended up here. - Where's your mom? - If I knew that, I wouldn't be out in the cold. - Dad? - Which one? No, don't do that. - Do what? - That. Look I have been on the street for four years. I don't need your pity. So as soon as my clothes are dry, I'll get away, and you can get on with your project. - I don't pity you. I've not known you for the last 17 years, so I don't pity you at all. But what I do know is the only reason I got through high school was because of you. You helped me through it, so I owe you. - You don't own me anything. - Yes, I do. So you're welcome to stay here until you get back on your feet. - You said yourself, yo don't even know me. - And you don't know me. I think after high school, we both know we can trust each other. All I ask is on a Tuesday night I get it to myself to work on my project as you put it. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - Oh, well, well, well, you don't call, you don't write. - I was at your door last Wednesday morning, remember before your special guest arrived. - I'm talking about the pub, man, the pub. I mean Paul's got some big-titted darling go up behind the bar, his cousin or something like that. Not that I'm complaining about the view. But she can't pull a pint for shit. So what's the story, you quit? - No, I had a friend staying with me the last few days. I'm just helping her out. - Ooh, her, it's a bird, is it? So when do I get to meet her, eh? - Not anytime soon. Look I'll be back at work tomorrow, okay? I'll speak to you then. - Aye, no bother. Oh listen, I'll be out tomorrow during the day, all right? Going to try and see the kids, so no surprise coffee visits, huh? - Okay. Good to know. - Lisa, come on. This is just stupid. What are you doing? - Bugger off. - Lisa, I said I'm sorry. Just come back. - Piss off, May. - Walk away like you always do. Stupid Cow. - Who the fuck are you? - It's Jacob. Sam's friend, we met a couple weeks ago. Do you need any help? - No, I'm fine. - Are you here alone? - Aye, my mate's just pissed off and left me. Said I'm a pain in the arse when I'm drunk. They're the arse holes. I don't need some creep like you chasing after me. I just want to go home. - Well I've been sitting here all night. - And? - You still haven't bought me a drink. - Well, well, well, Jacob, I have to say it's good to have you back, pal. - I'm surprised Paul didn't get you to cover for me. You are here often enough. - You couldn't afford to lose me as a customer. This place would go bust without me. - Jacob. - Norma? - Guess what. - What? - I have got a job. - Congratulations, Norma. Doing what? - Cleaner, mopping, brushing out closets, stuff like that. - Cleaner? - Yeah. - You sure that's what you want to do? - Well it's not as if I can be fussy. And come on, you haven't really settled and made it yourself, mr. big shot. You work in a pub. - Well the hours are flexible for me. - For your painting, I know. Well your million pound model is right here. Hello again. - Again? - Aye, we've met. - We have. - And if I remember correctly, you owe me a few alcoholic beverages. - Well at least I know where my first wage is goin'. Look I've got to go and do some paperwork, but as soon as I have for a month's rent, I'll be going. - Norma, there's no rush. - Thank you. - Huh? - Sam. - Huh? - Is very expensive today costing $10,000 or $15,000 if your getting 15. You look at them now after it's done, and nothing's changed. - How you feeling? - I'll be okay. I think I'm just coming down with something. - Well it's Tuesday night, so if you don't mind I-- - I just lightened my load. I'm not going anywhere. - You're looking at his bags under his eyes. And now he's just got black-- - But I need to keep going with my work. I've got deadlines to meet. - Jacob, I really can't move. The way I'm feeling I'll probably just crash here in an hour, and you can get on with your project in peace. - Very embarrassing for you. - I mean can you no do it another night? Unless of course, you're kicking me out. - Of course not. I'll be back in a few hours, okay? - Okay. - Lousy, so he asked me was that stupid? - You're fuckin' joking man. - I know. - I fuckin' had it. Check it out, man. - All right, sweetheart? - Fuck off. - Oh, a dirty mouth. I like that. Let me show you how to use it. Cow. - I'm sorry. Am I interrupting? - So what you gonna do this time? - Hit call. Do you need walked home? - Please. - You all right? - I'm fine. - What's your name? - Agnes. Thanks for that. Those guys were fucking arse holes. You don't need to walk me home. - I insist. - Don't worry about it. Honestly, it's not even that far. - Shush. I'm sorry. It's not supposed to be like this. I'm usually a lot more elegant, shush, not like those putrid animals back there. - Please, you don't have to do this. - What do you have going on down there? - You're right. You saved me from those pigs, but you don't have to do this. - You have no idea what I have to do. - Look just go, and we'll take this as a misunderstanding, okay? I won't go to the police, I swear. - Fuck you. - Jacob, you okay? - I'm fine. - Jacob? - I said I'm fine! - God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change. Courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference, amen. - Amen. I feel like I have a bug, a bug that's crawling under my skin. A bug that's living, breathing, controlling me. I'm not scared of it. I actually, well I actually quite enjoy it. I crave it. - I'm sorry, mate, but you're talking shit, so stop. Bill Paten, I don't believe we've been properly introduced. - Don't. Just don't. There's a lot of people here trying hard to stay off the drink, and you, you're talking about craving it, letting it control you. You're giving people the wrong impression. - Right, okay, let's take five minutes, hey? Look, I know you didn't agree what Bill said, but he's right. What the hell was that all about? - Who's that woman? - Forget the woman. When was the last time you had a drink? - Last Tuesday. - Last Tuesday? - Uh hmm. - Are you trying to take the piss outta me? And when'd you start again? - I never stopped. - You never stopped? You know Jacob, you've been coming here a long time. So if this is just some joke to wind me and the group up, you better come clean now. - I have an addiction, Russell, but I have it under control. - How often? - Once a week, but like I said I have it under control. - Look drugs, sex, drink, it doesn't matter what the addiction is. If you're addicted, you're not in control, and that just leads to catastrophe. You have to ditch it. Do you understand? - Yes. Now Russell please, the woman, what's her story? - Name's Catherine Dolan Pool. She's been coming here for a few months now. She lost a daughter last year, but she'd been doing well. She got another one on the way, her partner, well he's got cancer. He wants to end it all to stop the suffering. She's having none of it. Why are you so interested in her? - Support and hope, Russell, isn't that why we're here? Any word on Jacqueline? - No, nothing. - Send her friends and family my best. - Jacob, are you in there? - I'll be out in a sec. - I need to get in. I'm bursting, come on open the door. - Norma, Norma, I need you to leave. - What, piss of and let me in. - I'm sorry. - Norma, I'm serious I need you to go. - You all right? - I just need you to go. - No, not until I know you're all right. - Is this to do with your art project? Is it stressing you out? Tell me what's up. - Tango. - Tango? - That's right. Tango. - What's a tango? - You, you're the definition of a tango. You take and borrow from me, lift and hawk until there's nothing left. How long are you gonna bleed me dry, hmm? I keep you here. I feed you. I give you money. You now make your own money, and all I ask for is a bit of privacy on a Tuesday. - I'm sorry. - But no, you keep coming back. I'm too ill to go out. I think I'm gonna be sick. I mean what's wrong with you, hmm? Why can't you leave me alone? Are you curious about me? Does my self sufficient and independent life attract you? Or is there something else? Is it sexual? - I have cancer! I have cancer, and now I know how you feel. But I want to thank you for your hospitality, but I want no more of it. - All right Jacob, what can I get you? - Hi Freddy, just to pick up the steaks I ordered. - Oh right. Special occasion? - Just a guest who's dissatisfied with my hospitality. - I'm sure these'll go down a treat. - Thank you, Freddy. - No bother. - Was your steak cooked okay? - It was magic, thanks. It's lung cancer. I know you're dying to ask, but you also know it's rude to ask. So instead you're just sitting there making small talk while your curiosity eats away at you. Anyway, I don't know how long I've got, but don't worry I'm not gonna drop dead on your bathroom floor or anything like that. - I've told you before, you're not for this neck of the woods. - We go to the same school. We live in the same area. - And what? What are you gonna do? - You don't have to do this. You saved me from those pigs, but you don't have to do this. I won't go to the police, I swear. - Come on. Here, drink this. - It's not drugged, is it? - Do you think I'd waste it on you? - Why'd you bring me here? - Firstly, here I can be your mate, not just your customer. And secondly, it's the only other bar where I can get tick. So what's up? You get your coffee fix this morning, huh? - It's been a long week. - Long week? That's fine. I've got nothing better to do all day today. - It's Norma. - What about her? You shagged her yet? Oh wait, is that it? She's not putting out, huh? All right, sorry right, go on. - I've got creative activity every Tuesday night, and in order to get it done I need to get my privacy. - What you can't work there? - Exactly. - I see. Well here's an idea for you. Why don't you make her your creative activity and get her done, huh? I mean come on. Look as far as I can see you're not making much money at this art thing, right? So why don't you take a break, man? Relax, chill out, huh. Spend some time getting tore at that bird living with you. - What's your arrangements on a Tuesday night? - No, no. No, no, no, no way, man, no, no, no. You're not dumping me with her, so you can go off and do you artist stuff. - Sam, I know you. Your Tuesday nights consist of slumping up a bar, drowning yourself in whiskey and waiting for some big breasted stranger to walk in. And if that doesn't happen, you'll phone up one of you many female companions who you used and abused, and they thought they were oh so special. - All right, all right, fuck's sake. - Technically I'm helping you. - Right, how'd you work that out? - I'm cutting out the bit where you drink alone. - Ah. It's been a long time since I had a proper date. I don't get this. How come I take you out for a drink to help you, and I end up taking your bird out? - You are helping me more than you'll ever know. Norma, I've got some good news. - What? - I've got you a date Tuesday night. - Jacob, I don't want a date. Oh wait a minute, is this because of the other night? - No, it's not. I just think you and Sam would get on quite well. - Sam? The drunk in the bar that's who you're setting me up with? - All right, he does drink a lot, but let's be honest you're gonna end up drinking wherever you go. - Fine I'll go, but I'm getting hammered before it. - I wouldn't expect anything less. And you never know, you might even enjoy yourself. - Aye, right. - Thank you. - So family or relationship troubles? - Relationship. Men. - We're not all that bad. - Any progress with the missing woman. - No, nothing yet. - I'm Susan by the way. - Jacob. - The last months have been difficult, but before that I was on the drink, and I hit it hard. But you helped me. You lot got me through. Fraser passed away four days ago, and it was tough. It was so bloody hard. I miss him so much. Sometimes I think I should just end it just to be with him again. But it's wrong. And now I've got this one on the way. And I crave the drink. - We got you through it once, Christine. We'll get you through it again. - Have you seen Jackie at all? Take this, just keep an eye out for her. Thanks very much. Have you seen Jackie at all? Just keep a hold of that.. Keep looking out for her. - I'll do. - Thank you. Have any of you see Jackie at all? Just keep out for her, hey? Thank you. Bill, have you not seen Jackie? Were you not quite close? - No, we weren't close. She was lost, and I tried to help her. Nobody's heard from her Russell. I'm sure if they did, you'd be the first to find out. - Coffee? - Cheers. - You know Russell, one minute you're my sponsor, and the next you're playing detective. Which is it, hmm? - You know it's true as a sponsor I've got a reputation for being pretty tough. I'm sure some would even say a bit of a prick. But you see, Jacob, that doesn't bother me as long as I do my job and keep you guys clean and healthy. - What's your point? - Well you told be you'd stopped drinking. Clearly that's not been the case. So clearly I've not been doing my job properly. So clearly I need to be on your back even more. I'll be there to keep you clean. Now what was it this Tuesday, beer, whiskey, a glass of wine? - I told you, Russell, you don't need to worry about me. - You ever notice that you answer me without actually answering me? - I'll take that as a compliment. - You take that any way you want. Just remember I'll be keeping an eye on you for your benefit. - Not like those putrid animals. - Yo mate, you need any eccies? - No. - You want some? - Do I look like a pill popper to you? - Do you want me to answer that one, mate? - Challenge my answers one more time, and I'll make sure your face is seen on every lamppost with the word missing above your fucking forehead. - You fucking threatening me, you dick? - I am. Now disappear. - What a crude, wee, filthy asshole. I swear is he came near me, I would beat him six ways to Sunday. - You wee, creepy junkie, bum pot. My name's Lucy by the way, Lucy Walker. What's your name? - It's Jacob. - Well Jacob, you look far too classy for this place. - Thanks. - You look like you could use a fix, so I'll go and get us a couple of coffees, and then maybe you could show my your feng shui. Sound good? - Yes. - All right, black or white? - Excuse me? - Your coffee. - White please. - Sugar? - No. - Me neither, we're both sweet enough, right. Back in two secs. Well this is nice. Oh you're an artist. See I knew there was something enticing about you. You know I used to do a bit or art in third year at school, but it wasn't for me. And then I started modeling for like naked paintings n'stuff, so I guess you could call that art. - Would you like a coffee or something stronger? - No, I don't drink. Have you seen the streets? Did you know that alcohol has made more people homeless than drugs, and I wouldn't touch either. No, coffees fine for me, thanks. - There are worse things to be addicted to, trust me. - So do you ever to naked painting? What's it called again-- - Life drawing. And yes, I did. But I've moved into unexplored art. - Oh, like what? - Hello? - What are you doing back? - We thought you could do with some company. - No, what I needed was the exact opposite of company. - Hi, I'm Lucy. I love the dress. - Thanks. - Look we'll just get our of your way, let you get on with your project. - No, no, no, it's fine. It's just mismanaged. - What's the project? - Lucy sweetheart, I think you are the project. - We've got a bottle of wine why don't we just turn this into a kind of double date? - Right, well I don't drink. Did you know that alcohol has made more people homeless than drugs? - Is that right? - So yeah, I tried some fashion modeling, but it wasn't for me. Did you know I was nearly on page three until the photographer wanted to closet shots. Sack that. I wanted to move like enter everything at once, you know, TV, books, film, fashion, but I could not decide. And then eventually decided singing. But I wasn't very good at it. Not even auto-tune could sort this voice. - Christ, I need another. - So to ask the question again, what do you do for a living, Lucy? - Honestly, I'm in between jobs at the minute. Can you believe that? Well that's the short version anyway. So I notice that I'm in a one bedroom apartment, and there's two people living in it, so are you two going at it, doing the naughty? - No, no, no, no, you may be in between jobs, but I'm in between homes. Jacob's just letting me crash here until I get back on my feet. - Ah, what a hero? See I knew there was something special about you. No offense, but I'm glad you two aren't together because I think I might want this one all to myself. - You need to leave. - What? - Now! - Jacob, don't be so bloody rude. - And your bang out of order. - Get your coat. - My problem started a long time ago when I was 17. I was against the world and everything in it especially those closest to me. But nothing came close to when I got some alone time to release that monster inside me. I'm not religious. I remember seeing a funeral. There was a boy, a boy who used to bully me. His dad crashed a car. The boy died. Before he died, I prayed for that boy's death. The week after, I turned to drink. So you see you're addiction might've made you do bad things, but that doesn't mean to say you're bad people. Thanks very much. - Do you know I think that's the first time somebody's actually stood up here and spoke, and you've paid attention to what they've said. - You should get him to speak more often maybe even run these groups. - Raymond's spoken here before, Jacob, a few times. Maybe his words are just having an impact on you 'cause you wanna give up your Tuesday sessions. Why a Tuesday anyway? What's so special about Tuesdays? - I'm trying to appreciate Raymond's words. - But what's so special about Raymond's words all of a sudden? - Being an addict isn't your fault no matter what the addiction is. - Why do I get the feeling you're talking about more than alcohol here? - That's because I am. Hey Russell, I'm no canary. But Bill was looking rather bug eyed. Keep him close. - Police have appealed for the public's help in tracing a missing 24 year old girl. Lisa Cane was last seen in the South side of Glasgow around 7:30 p.m. on the seventh of February. Her family has not heard from her since and are concerned for her wellbeing. Lisa left Vincent Bar after a falling out with friends. She is described as around five foot tall, of slim to medium build with long blonde hair, blue eyes, and a fair complexion. - You can stay with one of us tonight. We'll take care of you. - I don't need taking care of. I'm not a wean. I need Fraser. - Fraser's gone Christine. I'm sorry, but he is. And if you turn back to the booze, you won't last long either. - Bill, saying she won't last long either aren't exactly the best choices of words when she just wants to be with your husband. - How 'bout you drop the smart arse routine and offer up some help? - I can't bring up this baby on my own. What kind of life will it have? - Excuse me. Mr. Partlow, what are you doing here? I contact you, not the other way around. - So do you want them or not? - You brought them here to an addiction group? Are you that moronic? - Isn't it for alcoholics? - It doesn't matter what it's for. - Well right now, you're my customer. So you buying or not? What about the payment? - It will be in a birthday card as always. And it doesn't matter if it's five days, five months, or five years, I contact you, understand? How are you feeling, Christine? - Like shit. How do you think I feel? - I was listening to Raymond very carefully about what he said about good people and bad people, and he's right. Wanting to end your life doesn't make you a bad person. You miss your husband. I believe love is doing whatever you can to be with someone. Love isn't a bad thing. So don't let anyone get in the way of it, Christine. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Listen my Tuesday nights are usually quite free. If you need someone to talk to, you're more than welcome to come to mine. - Please. - Okay. But we'll keep it between us for now, all right? - Someone's birthday? - Just an art supplier's. - Haven't seen you since last Tuesday when you had your little outburst. - Different shift patterns. - Totally see you weren't really interested, but I think she got a message along for a tutor. - Thank you. - Figured you weren't really into her. - We have different tastes. - Right. My question is why'd you have her over here if you hate her that much? - Look can we just drop last Tuesday please? - Okay. Well one good thing did come out of it. I got another date with Sam. - Really? - Yeah, he was actually really nice. He made an effort not to get drunk well at least till we got back here, and he paid for the whole night. - Congratulations. - So when's date number two, hmm? - Well we decided to wait a week. I thought that I would let you have the privacy that I never gave you last week, or the week before last, or the week before last. - Stop. It's fine. We're fine. I have to go post this. - I had a miscarriage. And in a sick kind of way, I was grateful. If you ever needed anybody that much, don't you think you'd, would to do anything to be with them? - Jacob, I need to talk to you. Jacob, I know you're in there. Open the door. Jacob, I need to talk to you. - Good evening Russell. - Evening. What's with the boxes? - Art work. - This is a nice place. - Russell, why are you here? - I was just passing by. - At 10 o'clock at night? - Is that water in that glass? - Take a sip and find out, or will the taste of alcohol throw you over the edge again? Tell me Russell, how're the kids, hmm? - I lost my partner and then turned to drink. And no excuse is ever a good one. What's your story? - I simply have a taste for it, but I can assure you, Russell, there's just water in that glass. - Look let's say I believe you, and I do. But I'm your sponsor. I need to ask you these things. - No, you're only my sponsor when it suits you. - You told me about your wee drink on a Tuesday night, and yet for two weeks, you've not touched a drop. Why the change? - Let's say unexpected company. - Didn't appear to be any here when I arrived. - Unexpectedly. No Russell, are we done playing detective here? - Fair enough. May I use your toilet before I leave? - No, you may not. Now get out. - Jacob? Hello? Anybody home? Hello? Jacob? You in there, pal? - I would like to pay for two months rent on container one, one, two please. - Name? - Gary Lutz. - Cash or card? - Cash. - I'll leave it for the manager in the morning. - The person you are calling can't come to the phone right now. Please leave your message after the beep. - Jacob, how you doing? It's Sam. Listen me and Norma were just leaving the pub, right. But I thought I'd just swing by and get a quick chat with you. But that wee outburst you had with that Lucy girl, it got me thinking. I've got an idea that can help you relieve some of that stress. Listen I'll see you soon, mate okay? Oh, I'm getting away now. - It's not his usual seat. - It's not his usual drink either. He's been acting weird every since he got back. - Have you got any extra hours going? - Sure, when for? - Now. - Now? - Got your message. Where's Norma? - She's at home, my home actually. - Your home? - Well you've hardly been yourself lately, Jacob, have you? - I've had a lot on, Sam. - Well here's the deal. I like Norma. And despite my many faults which you were so kind as to point out, she likes me. - Have you got something you want to tell me, Sam? - I think Norma should pack up all her belongings and move in with me where she's safe. - Safe? I've seen the way you treat women. - Yeah pal, I don't think it's my bad habits that are the problem here. - You do what you have to, Sam. How 'bout I take him home? - You sure? - As long as you pay me for the rest of the shift. Nice and easy. Nice and easy. - What are you doing? - Nice and easy. - You taking us home? - Of course. - You're some man, Jacob, you know that? The best. - Thank you. Now get some rest, hey. - Hey you're going the wrong way. - Oh no, no, this way's a shortcut. - Oh my head's bouncing, man. - Here take one of these. - These air fresheners used to last for months. Not anymore. Everything is just so cheap and worthless nowadays. Everything is just copied, regurgitated, then just spat back out. There's no love for originality anymore. So how's the headache, hmm? I'm going to remove this piece of cloth. You're very quiet, Sam. It makes it difficult to tell what you're thinking. And for someone who's been left in the dark and constrained to a chair, you don't seem particularly perturbed. - This is a wind up or something. Some wind up or joke. - Tell me something, Sam, what day is today? - Wednesday. It's a Wednesday? - That's right. Wednesday. I don't particularly like to get myself into these circumstances on a Wednesday. - What is this place? - That's a story for another day. Now what did you see, and what did you tell Norma? - Nothing. - Tell me. - Nothing. - Tell me. - I don't know. - It's okay. - Look I saw the ribcage. - I wasn't hiding it. - I don't know what you've done, Jacob. Maybe you've hurt somebody accidentally-- - Ha, accidentally? Tell me something, Sam. What makes you think it was an accident, hmm? - What, no. No, I know you. You're an artist, and you've got your project that you work on. - Do you want to know what my project is? I eradicate people. That's right. Every Tuesday night, I find my insignificant victim, and I simply kill them. - No. We've been pals for years. - Ha pals? We're not pals. I used you, Sam. The pigs, your precious pigs. - Look, look Jacob, I don't know anything. I don't, plus I didn't tell anyone. I promise. I'm not getting out of here, am I? - I'm afraid not. - Sam, I don't know where you are, but your car's outside your house. Will you call me? - Hi, who are you? - Excuse me, you just knocked on my door. - Unless you're a friend of Jacob's. Is he in? - No, I've no idea where he is. - My friend just went missing. I was supposed to meet her tonight, but she stood me up. - You couldn't have made much of an impression, hey. - Yeah well she's been depressed, so I phoned a few of her friends. Apparently, she'd arranged to meet Jacob tonight. I just wondered if she showed up. - No, don't think so. I been staying with Jacob the last few weeks, and he's always got this art thing on a Tuesday. - He told me about his painting. He doodles. But see it was him that invited her round. You all right? - I'll tell Jacob you came round when he gets back, but that's the best I can do. - I appreciate it. Christine, the girl's who's missing, she's pregnant. - All the fuckin' time. All this fucking time I've known you, you've been some sort of funking Ian Brady, Mayra Hindley, Fred West motherfucker. - And don't forget good old Jack the Ripper although he never got caught. As for the rest of 'em, why would I idolize such pathetic scum? - You think you're better than them do you? - I'm a saint compared to those distasteful beasts. - You are going to get caught! - The only ones that get caught are the ones who make mistakes. Tuesday nights, I kill the same Brit on the same night. It's good to have stability. - Yes, yes. - Then you come along, and rattle much fucking cage! - Morning. - Morning. - Where were you? - Took a shift at the pub and as per usual, Sam surpassed his limits, so I took him home. - I was at Sam's I never saw you there. - I never went inside. - You're lying to me. - Good night, Norma. - What's the Tuesday project, Jacob? - What's with all the questions, Norma? - Sam's not answering his phone. You said you took him home, but he's not there. I mean we all have secrets, right? Things we want to keep you ourselves, but you are on a different level. - We all have things we want to keep to ourselves, Norma. It's not a crime. - Do you want to know what my secret is, do you? I don't have cancer. I made it up. - I watched you vomit. Christ, I had the flu. I've been living on the street for months. I'm bound to sick, am I not? I thought I needed you like when we were back in school. So happy to see you, Jacob, I used you. But you're not worth it. I mean your twisted mood swings, randoms showing up looking for missing women. - Missing woman, what missing woman? Norma, what's wrong with you? - I took a paracetamol from your bathroom. - Norma, what missing woman? He said her name was Christine. - He said? Who said that, Norma? - Your mystery friend Russell. - Russell was here? - What's your Tuesday project, Jacob? - My project? You want to know what my project is? - Hey Cleek, I've told you before your not for this neck of the woods, so stop cutting through it. - We go to the same school. We live in the same area. - And what? - Don't. - What are you going to do? - Leave him alone Kenneth. - Norma Bagwell, you know I don't get you. One minute you want me deep inside you, then you're hanging about with this retard. - So because I'm paying him some attention, you kick the shit out of him? Mature Kenneth, really mature. - Thought that beating I gave you last month was bad, just wait till you see what's coming next, you wee shit. - It's pretty dark in there. Nobody ever goes deep inside. - It wasn't what you did, it was how easy we got away with it. You carried on as if nothing happened. I couldn't do that. I had to try it again. - Right, let's go. - Pick someone at random, a stranger. It became my hobby, my pet project. And then you came back. And now you know too much. Good morning, could I please have a taxi? - When for? - Yes, for now. What's the address? - It's one, two, seven Renton Street. - The name? - Yeah, Cleek. - Okay as soon as we can. - Okay, thank you. Good morning Russell. - Morning. I was here a few hours ago. That girl said you were out. - Yes, Norma did say you were looking for me, hence the phone call. - Where is she this Norma girl? Did she mention Christine? - Christine? I'm afraid not. Norma's way back to Ireland some bother with an ex-junkie boyfriend. - Is she another one of your distant friends? - Russell, why do I get the impression you're not here to talk about Norma, hmm? - Because you arranged to meet Christine last night, and now nobody can get ahold of her. That's strange don't you think considering you were out all night? - It is strange. And that's what I thought when she didn't show up. As for me being out all night, after our conversation I took a shift at the pub, and then I met up with a friend, and I'm afraid to say it got rather messy. - And your friend, what's his name? - Sam McBride. - This Sam, he'll be able to corroborate this? - Corroborate? Yeah, he'll be able to corroborate it if you can get ahold of him. You see Sam and Norma became very close, so he left with her to protect her from this junkie. And I think it's time I found myself a new sponsor 'cause I've had quite enough of these harassments. Now if you'll excuse me? Shush. Shush. I wish I could make it more humane. Don't worry. They will find you. You will be my last ever victim here, and the only one ever to be found. I truly am sorry. Good morning Susan. - Morning. - Running late today? - Just a little. Jacob, I was wondering if you'd like to go out sometime for a coffee, lunch, even dinner. - Are you free Tuesday nights? - Afraid not, I work late on a Tuesday. Why Tuesdays? - No reason. Isn't that your bus coming? How 'bout Wednesday? - What you reading? - Do you remember that woman who was killed in an alley the week before we went on our first date? - Vaguely. - Well it seems that a tissue containing her saliva was found in a self storage park along with several other bodies. What did you see? It says that on the tissue there were specks of blood from a mechanic named Richard Foster, and he's the main suspect. The self storage container was opened when the rent on the property hadn't been paid for several months. The tenant paid in cash, and police believe the name used Gary Lutz is fake, and there might be a serial killer or killers targeting women. - Why are you so interested? - It's just scary. You could've been a victim. - Well I'm just glad we moved to the country where it's safe. I'll go fix us some lunch, hey? Jacob, that's lunch ready. There's actually something else I kinda wanted to talk to you about. It ties in with living in a safe place. - I look forward to it. - Anyway, I'll make up some tea. - I believe the next few months will be very interesting.
