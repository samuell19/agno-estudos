Hmm? You must help me. You must help me. In the few weeks that little boy was with me, I learned to love him very much. I learned to love him very much. It would break my heart if the society took him back to the orphanage. That we must prevent. That we must prevent. The boy's only trouble is his sensitivity, his feeling that he doesn't belong, his insecurity. his feeling that he doesn't belong, his insecurity. As long as he can avoid people, he's quite happy.

He never speaks a word in his native language now, He never speaks a word in his native language now, and he's so bright and quick to learn.

Thanks to that book you gave him, he'll soon be the slangiest young fellow in the valley. he'll soon be the slangiest young fellow in the valley. (chuckling) Oh, how my husband would have loved him. Ever since Fred didn't return from overseas, I've been very lonely. I've been very lonely. Paul's filled an emotional need, I suppose. I know.

And, please God, the dog may be your link back to reality. Can he stay in my room tonight? Can he stay in my room tonight? Please Father? Now, now, we've been over that so many times. Off with you. Off with you. Maybe if I leave the barn door open, Rin wouldn't feel like he's all alone. He wouldn't run off. No, I don't believe he would. He's too intelligent and well fed to run away. He's too intelligent and well fed to run away. All right, leave the barn door open. Thank you, Father. Thank you, Father. Come on, Rin! Come here, boy!

Thank you, son. "To Father Matthew, from Paul." I shall treasure it. I shall treasure it. I've been thinking you weren't too strong for religious symbols. I drew another in my bedroom. I see.

Do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that persecute and columniate, that you may be that persecute and columniate, that you may be the children of your Father who is in Heaven, the children of your Father who is in Heaven, who maketh His sun to rise upon the good and bad, and raineth upon the just and the unjust. and raineth upon the just and the unjust. For if you love them that love you, what reward shall you have? what reward shall you have? Do not even (mumbling)?

Father feels bad because I don't go to chapel. Father feels bad because I don't go to chapel. Father's a very good man, Rin. But I just can't go into the chapel But I just can't go into the chapel when all those people are there. He keeps saying have faith and love God, He keeps saying have faith and love God, and everything will be all right. I can't love God. I can't love nobody! I can't love nobody!

There was a lot of kids like me. There was a lot of kids like me. I fought with them for a bit of bread. Just a little bit of bread. Just a little bit of bread. And that's how it was. And that's how it was. I saw a lot of things Father Matthew doesn't know about. After, I don't dare love nobody. Something happens every time. It's me. It's something inside me. It's something inside me. (crying) But I love you, Rin. I love you. Father Matthew? Father Matthew? Yes? I'm Gordon Melrose from Santa Barbara. How do you do?

The boy's sensitive, fine, very intelligent, The boy's sensitive, fine, very intelligent, but he's suffered a great deal.

Not a chance, Father. Not a chance, Father. Rin cost me $2500, and plenty of sweat and trouble to train. But he's best dog I ever had. But he's best dog I ever had. How about getting this boy another dog? I'm afraid just any dog wouldn't do, sir. I'm afraid just any dog wouldn't do, sir. You see, it's, well, quite an involved matter of affection for a certain animal or being. of affection for a certain animal or being. Well, that's too bad, Father. Sorry, I can't help you.

Now, now, sir, let's have the dog. Now, now, sir, let's have the dog. Here, you tramp, you come out here. Rin belongs to Mr. Melrose, Paul. I'll send a check for a month's feed and keep. But at that, I wouldn't say he got much care here. But at that, I wouldn't say he got much care here. No. He's probably been leading a dog's life. (laughing) Well, so long, Father. (somber music) (somber music) Well, my son, we have quite a bit of reality to face. Well, my son, we have quite a bit of reality to face. Yes, Father. Now, about the dog. We may never see him again. But if he should come back, he's going to prove something. But if he should come back, he's going to prove something. It'll prove there's a bond between you and Rin.

Now, about these fears. Now, about these fears. We must learn to face them, Paul. We know their origin, and that's half the battle. We know their origin, and that's half the battle. No one in America is going to hurt you. We want to be your friends. We want to be your friends. I want always to be your friend. You like me, don't you? I daren't! I daren't! I daren't like you! Yes, Paul, go on. If I like somebody very much, it happens. If I like somebody very much, it happens. Something always happens. Like Rin, and people, too. Like Rin, and people, too. It's been that way a long, long time. This can't be so, my boy. This can't be so, my boy. Paul, we must read more together. Paul, we must read more together. In this book is all the wisdom, all that men have learned through the ages. God's own word is here, son. God's own word is here, son. It'll tell us that such a thing can't be so. Let Him prove it. Let Him prove it. Prove it? Let God show me this isn't always gonna happen. Paul, that's close to sacrilege. Paul, that's close to sacrilege. It's faith we need. Strong inner faith.

Rin must be made to remember where he belongs. Rin must be made to remember where he belongs. (engine rumbling) Why didn't God step in and do something? Why didn't God step in and do something? God has His own way of stepping in, Paul, and usually at the right time. and usually at the right time. But Father, it would've been better if the dog hadn't come to Paul in the first place. The boy improved a great deal after Rin came, Mrs. Graham. The boy improved a great deal after Rin came, Mrs. Graham. Yes, but he's gone now, and it seems to have Yes, but he's gone now, and it seems to have pushed the boy further back. He may become really bitter. No, not Paul. No, not Paul. Bitterness would have come to him in the first reaction after adversity, if it were coming it all. after adversity, if it were coming it all. But it seemed so perfect at first. Paul was beginning to believe that something, Paul was beginning to believe that something, even a dog, loved him. Then that man took Rin away. How can you see any good in that? How can you see any good in that? Well, the scriptures tell us, if ye have faith, Well, the scriptures tell us, if ye have faith, nothing shall be impossible unto you.
