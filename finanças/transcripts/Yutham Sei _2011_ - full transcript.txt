Is the auto for hire? - No. The auto has broken down. Who is that girl? - She is a passenger. What happened to her? Why is she sitting like this? I think she is ill. Hello? Excuse me. Are you alright? Hello? 'YUDDHAM SEI' Where's Alex? - Sir? - Where's Alex? He has gone to Vellore CMC. - Why? - We have got a lead. So he has gone to CMC Hospital. - Where's Pugazhenthi? He's on medical leave. - Go to hell! JK? Will you please come here? JK, Will you come in? What's this? - I need three months medical leave. JK, the Commissioner called me. He said it's a sensational case. Give it to somebody else. Alex is on Savita's case. Pugazhenthi is on leave. You are the only one who's left. I have got some work. It's been three months since case 56 was closed. I am going to reopen it. The Commissioner wants a right man for this job. - It isn't me. You are the best man in my team. - I need to go, sir. The CBCID cannot investigate a law and order case. - They can. What is this? - It's my resignation. Okay, let's have a deal. You start on this case. I'll request permission to investigate your sister's case. I give you my work. Please, JK. He is Mr. JK. He will be your superior. Follow him closely. You will learn a lot from him. Sir, I'm Prakash. - Where's the corpse? It is at Stanley. - Male or female? There were two severed hands in a cardboard box. JK, these are the profiles of these two. 'Smoking is injurious to health.' Oh, no! - Who's Narayanan? The body of Ekambaram has come. Judas.. J. Krishnamurti. - That isn't my name. But that name suits you. Are you new? - I have been SI for two years. I have been with corpses for 28 years. JK has been for nine years. Judas, the severed arms case has to be given to the CBCID. It has been transferred. - Show us the details. Whose corpse is this? Samantha. Suicide by hanging. Due to the neighbour's complaint, it has been brought for autopsy. Is it a murder? - No. Suicide. But she has been raped before that. Her parents were begging me. They wanted a certificate that there had been no rape. What are you going to report? JK.. Here, hold this. These belong to a male. By the decomposition rate, it has been cut 48 hours earlier. By bone ossification, the man's age would be around 28 to 36 years. What was the weapon used? There were chips of bone. It was surely an electric saw. How about this wound? The hands must have been tied up. There were some saw dust too. The arms must have been severed off while the person was alive. These were the wood splinters in the fingernails. Is there any chance that the person could be still alive? He has to find that out. The observer is being observed. J. Krishnamurti. Come.. Is this it? - No. - Go. Next! Is this it? - No. - Go. Is this it? - No. Next! Is this it? - No. Next.. Sir, what was your report about the dead girl? I wrote that there was no rape. - But it was a rape, wasn't it? I had a girl of her age. Had? - She is dead. Oh, no! You died! Stop crying. What's your husband's name? Murthy. Does this arm belong to your husband? - Yes, it is. The circlet on his hand is my 'Minji'. God! Why do I have to see the arm that beats me in such a state! When did you last see your husband? He went out for work. He didn't return after that. When? - Three days back. He didn't return. I even complained to the police. But now.. Is your husband's auto rickshaw's registration 3233? I don't know. - Is there a picture of Sachin Tendulkar in it? Yes. It was parked in a corner inside Chockalingam Colony. Who gave you information about the auto? The Ghurkha who patrols here at night. In which direction was the auto facing? Towards Thenampettai. Don't make me do such things. If this gets out, I'll lose my job. Did you get me all the records? The records are up to date from the month of February. Get me some booze on the way. There is money in that cover. Go and drink. Get out now. Drat! Pest! Why can't you remain silent if you see something? This has become a torture. Child, did you see the auto.. - Why are you disturbing me? I didn't see anybody. Only an auto was parked there. You told the police that someone was repairing the auto.. I have told everything to the police! Did you see this girl that day? No. I did not. Who's this? Is she your lover? - Hey, fool! That's his sister. Please, tell me. Did this girl hire an auto on 6th of September? Hey, didn't your wife elope with Ravi on that day? - Shut up! Please try to remember. Did my sister hire an auto? Buy us tea. There were no passengers that day. We went home early. Sir, didn't you go for the last hire at 8:20 PM? - Yes, I did. You saw an auto, didn't you? - Yes, I said so. Was the girl inside? - It was raining heavily. I couldn't see anything. Sir, please think again. I drive an auto because I am an illiterate. Just go. Who's Surendran? Who are you calling me by name? I am Policeman. - Which station do you belong? CBCID. - So what? Is the girl in it too? What was the quarrel between you and Murthy who worked for you? Why? What's the matter? - He has been murdered. Oh, is it so? Didn't he work here? What was the quarrel? He asked me a lot of questions. I gave him a tight slap. Hey, do you want to come to the police station and answer? Hey, look at this girl here! Hey, Surendran! - Hey, pour the tea. Hey, why are you showing off your CBCID authority? Not even one Policeman has come into my shed. Go, ask somebody else. Just push off! Surendran! - Who's that? Tell me. What was the quarrel between you and Murthy? He pawned my wife's jewels for Rs. 15,000 instead of 10,000. I asked him why. He started justifying himself. I beat him up with the guys. That was the quarrel. What did Murthy do then? He brought Rajamanickam and solved the issue. I told him that I don't want to see him again. He went off. Who's Rajamanickam? He is a graveyard keeper. What? - A graveyard keeper. Where does your son work? He was working at a courier office. But he dropped it. He has been unemployed for an year. What is your son's phone number? It's written on that calendar. When did you buy this TV? My son bought it last month. Didn't you ask him how he got the money? I asked him. But he said that he won at gambling. Has your son got any vehicle? - Yes, a motorbike. The call is going through. Okay, hang up. Prakash, enquire with the pawn broker mentioned by Surendran. Kittappa. - Sir? We have to enquire Murthy's house again. We have to check it too. See whether he has bought some other things besides the TV. Okay. We have identified only one victim. The other remains unidentified. Enquire whether any of Murthy's friends are missing. - Yes, I will. Kittappa, I don't think this case would end soon. Sir, this is just a quarrel between ruffians. They must have severed the arms to warn others. We'll solve it soon. No, ruffians won't use an electric saw. And the hand wasn't lying on the road. The new year was celebrated in the park where the AC jogs and the arm was thrown where the crowd gathered. Okay, what might be the motive? I don't understand. I don't understand anything. Stop the vehicle. His home isn't here, right? - The girl was lost here. Who's that? - His sister. How did she get lost? Don't know. We haven't got a clue. She came out of her friend's house at 8:30 PM. No one knows what happened after that. The police tried everything for three months. But no news of her. Poor man! He goes about half dead. Why is he standing there? - The girl's phone was lying there. Do you know him for long? - When he was a SI in Minjur I was a constable there. He kept me by his side till the end. Why did he move from law and enforcement to CBCID? He is honest. It is the price one has to pay for being honest. So he got himself transferred to CBCID. All these nine years, he worked without taking a day off. He keeps working all the time and never got married. Where are his parents? Sir, where are his parents? On the way back from Tirupathi, the taxi that they were travelling hit a lorry and they both died on the spot. Tell them to clear off. No photos allowed. Tell them to go back. Please come. Oh, no! Rajamanickam! Who has done this heinous deed! Oh, my dear! Rajamanickam! You left me. Sir, who do you think the arms that displayed first belong to? If you notice the records of the two victims the police have not given a clean status. So we believe that the remaining victim is also a criminal. What do you think is the motive? It is mysterious. Severed arms put in public places. Everything is a preplanned action. Why did they throw it on the streets? We haven't got a clear picture about that. Only the arms have been found. Could the victims be alive? We will be happy if they are alive. We are trying hard to find them. Will this continue? - I beg your pardon? Will these incidents continue? That's all for today. We have a lot to do. - Sir.. The Ladies hostel serial killing case which the police had dropped was solved by you when you found murderer, Arun Siddharth. Will you solve this case too? Mr. JK, do you think your missing sister is still alive? Are you out of your mind? Please leave. Are your facts right? - Yes, sir. - On the street? Same area? Are you sure? Listen, Rajamanickam's bike is parked at Triplicane. The area constable has seen it. He's still there. Is he in Mufti? - Yes. What shall we do now? Constable - Sir. - How did you find the bike? We received information from the Commissioner's office. Since it was a Yezdi, I found it easily. Murugesh! Have you seen this person in the photograph? Yes. He used to come here. Last night, this guy was here. I bought him booze. Which room? - 312. Hey, show him the room no. 312. - Come with me. This is room no. 312. Do you have the deceased's address? - Yes, I do. It is a small village near Pudukottai. Was anyone else staying with him? Three months back, he brought a friend and shared the room. Is it so? What is his name? His name is Jon Britto. - Where does he work? I don't know. He hasn't been here for a month and a half. Sir, from the missing people list for six months Jon Britto has been missing since the 8th of November. He left home last August. He went off to stay with Raghu. How does your brother and Raghu know each other? They studied diploma together at Chettinad Polytechnic. When did you last see your brother? He called my wife on the 5th of November asking for money. On 10th November, Raghu called and asked me where Britto was. I was confused. He went to Abhirami Theatre to watch a movie on the 8th but never returned. We gave a complaint on the 12th. But till now we don't know what happened to him. Why did he go out to stay in a mansion? He didn't. I sent him out. He was full of lies. He brought a man to humiliation. Who? - Dr. Purushothaman. What was the name again? Dr. Purushothaman, who was the dean at the GH. Sir, he committed suicide with his family in September. 'Sorry, no comments. I have told everything to the police.' 'Please! - One question please.' 'We found out a DD worth Rs. 60,000' 'in his wife, Annapoorani's name in Dr. Purushothaman's drawer.' 'He is a leading heart surgeon in our country.' 'But the police have found that he received bribes.' 'I don't have any comments on that. But I'll tell you this.' Purushothaman is my friend. He is very honest. What the hell? Who are you? What do you want? You could have called.. - What's happening? Please be seated. Can I have a smoke? - Sure. This is such a shame for the law enforcement to have given this case to the CBCID. This is very sensitive and sensational. That is why I gave it to you. We know, sir. - The CM is yelling over the phone. I need your help. - We are with you. We'll solve it. Drat! Tell me what the lead is. How are Rajamanickam and Raghu related? We aren't very clear about it. But Raghu has known something about Rajamanickam. Raghu has been murdered in order to cover that up. Who? Those who display those severed arms? We are still.. - No, sir. - What? Raghu was murdered by someone else. The ones who display the arms are somebody else. How? How can you be so certain? Raghu's murder was to silence him. But the arms were displayed to convey something. What? What's he saying? Sir. Both the vehicles of Rajamanickam and Murthy whose arms have been displayed were discarded on the road. They were both followed and kidnapped. There was wood splinters in their fingernails. The elbows bear marks of being bound. The victims have been tortured. The arms have been wrapped in similar plastic covers and put in similar cartons. These arms have been displayed in public places. For easy identification, the rings and circlets have been left. So everything is in the same pattern. It is well designed. But Raghu's murder was committed hastily. What's the next lead? Britto who was staying with Raghu, is the lead. How is Britto related to this case? Britto has complained that he has given Rs. 60,000 as bribe to late Dr. Purushothaman. Britto's brother has been supplying surgical instruments to Dr. Purushothaman for the past ten years. When enquired, he said that Dr. Purushothaman was very honest. So why did Britto lie? Is Rs. 60,000 really the reason for a family suicide? What do we do next? We need to reopen Dr. Purushothaman's case. Go ahead. I give you my permission. Thank you, sir. And you are doing a good job. - Thank you, sir. Dr. Purushothaman's suicide was our newspaper's exclusive news. The bribe was just an accusation. It was never proved. Why should he commit suicide? Didn't this question occur to you? There was a report on the doctor's wife too. What report? In the college in where she worked, a 19 year old lab assistant.. she.. - What? A report came in that she called him for sex. We never published that. It could have been a rumour. I didn't want her reputation to be spoiled. We have requested the files of accused who are over six feet. Murthy and Rajamanickam's houses are being watched by men in mufti. I enquired in the college in which the wife of the doctor had worked. Everyone spoke highly of her. The students too. The management, being a women's college had suspended her in order to avoid sex scandals. The peon, Manikantan was spoken ill of everywhere. He seems to have borrowed money from most of the students. Did you investigate him? - I went to his house. What did you get? - We got nothing. - What? He has been missing since the 8th of November. Hi. Ajay, I can spend only half an hour with you. What? You said we can go out, didn't you? I did, but I forgot that today's Friday. Our family is going to Kapaleeshwarar temple. I'm sorry. We'll go next week. Dad starts asking questions even if I'm a bit late. Here. Have some iced tea. - Thanks. Durga? What happened? What happened? - I don't know. I feel dizzy after drinking this. You said that you wanted to go home in half an hour, right? Oh, God! Stop. I'll get down. Bye. - Goodbye! Stop. Ma'am, I have given every file regarding the family. It's getting late. I have to go home. Read them and return it. - Okay, thanks. Sir! - What? The dead doctor had a daughter named Suja. And she has gone missing. When? - 6th of September, the day that your sister was lost. Tell me. - You handled Dr. Purushothaman's case, right? Hey, bring me some tea! Tell me. You handled Dr. Purushothaman's case, right? That fraudster! The accusations weren't proven. - He committed suicide fearing it. He committed suicide with the whole family. His wife is a bad egg. Why did the boy commit suicide? - I don't know. How can you close the file without finding the motive? What else could be the motive? He must have been ashamed. The man is a fraudster. The woman was lecherous. The girl eloped with someone. The girl was lost. Yes. But she must have eloped. She boarded an auto after her dance classes. But she never reached home. - I investigated too. Her brother usually picks her up from dance classes. His brother had an accident that day. So she took the chance and eloped. The neighbours spoke well of the girl. Why are you so innocent? Hey, bring the tea soon! The women are very cunning these days. Do you know who this is? Sir! Sir, you came to investigate the suicide case, right? I have got a lot of work to do. Mr. Isakkimuthu, the commissioner has given the CBCID special permission to investigate this case. Will you talk here? Or should we escort you to our office? Sit down. Tell me. - Do you know who this is? - Duraipandi. You closed Duraipandi's case.. - What? You handled the case against him by Purushothaman, right? Yes. - Tell me about it. I received a complaint last February. Hey, come in. - Come in and say that. How dare you do such a thing! - Come in! Who are you? Are you a Policeman? How dare you beat him! This guy was peeping at women changing in the trial rooms. Hey, file an FIR on these men for being a ruffian in the station. What did we do? He is the guilty one. - Take your hands off him! Complain to us if he has done something wrong. Why did you beating him up? Who gave you the authority to do that? Give me a written complaint of what he has done. I'll take him to the court and get him punished. Who are you to judge him? How dare you beat him! Please come. Sit down. Give this man some water. Someone tell me exactly what had happened. Sir, I work in a software company. - Cut to the point. My wife and I went to a shop to purchase clothes. This man was peeping at the women changing clothes in the trial room. Whose wife did he see? Yours? - No. - Who else? Yours? No. - Yours? - No. - Whom did he see then? They are outside. - Outside? Whom did he see? Whom did he see? I got the complaint. But Duraipandi was proved innocent at court. The manager of his shop accepted that he was guilty. Did he accept it or take the blame on himself? Ask the judge who gave the judgment. Mr. Duraipandi, regarding the case of you peeping at women.. Sorry. I didn't peep. There's a case against you filed by the doctor's family, right? Yes - You have long sight and can't see anything without glasses. So, the judge acquitted you, right? Yes. - How long had your manager been working for you? Nadhamani, was working in my mill for about 8 years. I thought him to be trustworthy and made him a manager here. I didn't expect that he would do such a thing. Your office room was exactly behind the dressing room, right? The office washroom was there. You used to be alone in the office, right? I used to go there twice a week. The manager would be there. And the washroom? - I have never used it. What did you do when the problem occurred? I was at the store, checking the Ludhiana stock files. Suddenly I heard some noise. The manager came running out of the washroom and started crying at my feet. I asked him what had happened. Break the glass! - There's a room in there. Hey, who's in there? Come out.. Who's there? Beat him up! Hey, who's the owner? Let's thrash him up. Did you see? Who was it? Check there. Hey, who was it? Hey, a guy is hiding here. A mob. It was such a rough mob. I was sitting down due to fear. They beat me up and never listened to me. They dragged me to the police station. All the respect, reputation and name I had in the society was ruined in a single day by the doctor's family.. My son! My own son! He slapped me with his slippers. The clothes shop which was turning profits up to Rs. 6 crores was forced to be closed in a day. Who is your ophthalmologist? I don't remember. The manager is in Puzhal jail. Should we enquire him? We won't get anything out of him. He'll say that he is guilty. Have you seen the film, Rashomon? - What film is that? English? Isakkimuthu and Duraipandi were telling their version of the story. But we don't know whether that is the truth. We'll get to know it gradually. Look. All charred bodies. How was it proved as suicide? The police say that the door was locked from the inside.. - No.. How did you prove it in your autopsy report? See. This is a male. And this is a female. By the growth of her thigh bones We can estimate this as above 40 and this as above 50. This belongs to the youth man. It must be their son. But this is completely charred! This a passport size photograph of Dr. Purushothaman. We have enlarged it. This is the skull dimension of the dead body. Both these images match. This is his wife. It was taken from her photograph. This skull dimension fits too. This is their son. This skull dimension matches too. But you know, the most important evidence is this. The boy had a fractured right ankle during the suicide. And this body has the fracture at the exact spot. So that's the whole story. Why can't this be a murder? - No. It can't be. There are no injuries on the head. And no other fractures on the body. What if someone had poisoned them? You know, J. Krishnamurti used to read a lot of novels. I think you read a lot of fiction too. Who called you saying that Suja had an accident? Someone. They called from her brother's mobile phone. I told her to confirm it by calling her home. She called home. Even her mother had got a call. Her dad had gone to the hospital and her mom told her to come home. So, I sent her immediately. Did the auto leave as soon as she got in? I remember that the auto had some trouble starting. Immediately a guy went to the rear and started repairing it. When the one in the front tried, the auto started. So were there two drivers in it? - Yes. Did you tell this to the police? - They didn't ask me anything. Mister, are you crazy? How many times have I told you! Why are you disturbing us? Shut your mouth! Go in. If you talk, I'll arrest you for prostitution. Go in! Only one man was sitting at the rear and was repairing. Sir, there was someone else in the driver's seat. I saw that. Thanks. Thank you so much. Kittappa, I have some faith. - Will your sister be found? If we find out what happened to the doctor's daughter we can find out what happened to Charu. How? There's some relationship between her disappearance and Charu's. This is the shortest route for the girl to go home. He didn't believe anything I said. He wheedled the truth out my own mouth. Why did you answer them in the first place? I couldn't help it. He was sitting right in front and staring at me. Like this. He was staring at me like this! Not only him. Two others too. With accusing eyes. And a girl too. She was very lovely. The case has been closed, right? Why do you worry now? Closed? JK is cunning. He'll probe at it again. Hey, Thirisangu! I'm very afraid. If JK comes again, I'll spill the beans. You realise it now, don't you? You should have stayed put. You shouldn't have peeped inside the dressing room. Sheriff, Inba. Don't do any shows till I tell you. Lay low for a few days. There have been no shows for almost a month. Our business is doing good. - You, fool! The show will go on only if Nagu, Murthy and Rajamanickam are here. They are missing and you say there's no trouble! Somebody is playing with us. It isn't a game. Some clever guy is opposing us. Thirisangu, help me escape. I'll go off on a pilgrimage. I am not brave enough to die. Hey, you go in. Kittappa. Who's it? - It's my son. Where's your son? - We don't allow him in. We know that there are cases registered against him. We have to think about our daughter's life. So I told him that I'll call the police if he returns home. He hasn't come here for almost a year. What did he do now? Father. - Go in, dear. I'll come. Does your son have any friends? - I don't know. Has he got a bike? - A black Yamaha. Tell me. Poonkundran.. Devarsangan. Sengundran. Sampath. Duraipandi. Singaram. Mister, what shall we do? - Let's go and surrender. Or else, let's shoot ourselves in the head and die. Here, shoot yourself. Sir! Our men who went to kill JK, got caught. Sheriff's house was raided. That rascal is missing. If Sheriff gets caught, we'll be ruined. Hey, shut your mouth! - How can I? JK has ruined us. He has found out our crimes. He'll hang us soon. I want to know what the girls we held shows are doing now. I need to know where Suja is. After that.. - What about JK? ...we'll take care of it. The club has totally 221 members. There are eight game divisions. Pokers, Swimming, Chess, Carom, Table Tennis, Football.. Are there divisions in tennis? Yes. - How many in total? 23 members. I need the address and phone number of all those 23 people immediately. Sure. I'll get it. Sir, greetings! "It is a letter that arrives quickly." Oh, no! Go! Go.. "It will run and follow you" "and say that I'm your trouble." "It will return.." "Your staff that brings the light." No! Please, no.. Please go away. Where's JK? Where's JK? Sir. - This time it's a head. Not an arm. Do you have anything to say? What theory do you have for this? - I have one. The head was not put out in a public place. It was put in front of the police station. That's obvious. I saw that. - Did you see the eyes? The eyelids have been cut off. So that the eyes remain open. Tell me clearly. This station has a lot of garbage. - Give me a straightforward answer. Those eyes are watching something. It's searching for someone. Somebody get some cigarettes. Please listen to me. Are you mad? I have power only in CBCID not in Law and Order. Get the Commissioner's permission. How? How can I ask him? How can I ask him permission to overhear phone calls of an AC and an Inspector in his department? The Commissioner would insult me. Already he is being shouted at by the CM. And if we blame his department.. JK, leave it. Ask me something else. Then we'll arrest the AC and the Inspector. What? What do you mean? On what grounds will you arrest them? The second arm was put out in the park where the AC Thirisangu goes for walks. All the other head and arms have been put in the same AC's area of jurisdiction. Dr. Purushothaman has complained in this station that his daughter was missing. Mr. Isakkimuthu, the SI has handled his case. The death of Dr. Purushothaman's family as suicide was filed there. Everything is connected to that station. So? So, what? One more thing. After the Commissioner's press meet when we got news from the constable at Triplicane that Rajamanickam's bike had been found there were eight people with us. And one among them was AC Thirisangu. Give me a cigarette! Sorry, JK. I can't do it. Ask me something else. Get me a weapons permit. What? - I need a gun from the armoury. Get me a letter. Eat. - Let me out. I want to go. Please. What did I do? Why have you locked me up? You should have gone home straight from your friend's house. Why did you ask who and why she was in the auto? Now you have been brought here. I didn't know what to do. Why did you kidnap her? That is my business. What happened to her? You are unharmed, right? Be grateful for that. How long will you keep me locked up like this? I don't know that. I can't let you go. And I don't wish to kill you. But I know one thing. I will need you someday. My brother will nab you. - I'm a Policeman. I won't lose to another Policeman. I'll be back in the morning. - Okay, sir. Who are you? Hey, who are you? Why are you sitting here? Hey, what do you want? What are you doing here? What is that? Sir. - Wait. Hey! Tamizh! Get in! Are you crazy? Who told you to go after them? - Sorry, sir. I lost them. Idiot. Tamizh? Tamizh? Tamizh.. Hey, what are you reading? Sleep. - Where are you going? I have got some work to do. I'll come soon. Dr. Wasim, here. - We are calling from Ashok Nagar police station. I need to clarify something. It's in our reports that you and Dr. Purushothaman studied MBBS in Vellore together. Yes. That's right. Is there anybody else who studied with you, in Chennai? The ones who studied with me? Yes. There is one. But he is not a doctor. What's his name? Thank you so much, Doctor. There were two people in the van. Yes. I saw that too. - One was a lady. - What? Her head was shaved. Sir, this was cut open. Sir, this is the youngest corpse in here. - Has it been claimed? No. - There is an unnamed 16 year old corpse in this list. Where's it? - What's the number? - 37. Come here. That's 37. But that's old. It has been here for five or six months. It is an orphaned corpse. The neck has been wrung. Hasn't the body been disposed yet? - The case wouldn't have ended yet. Next month all the corpses will be given to the graveyard. Open it up. It won't stink. You can look. Hey, the body is not here! - I don't know anything about it. Where's the corpse of the boy? - I don't know! Cunning idiot! The thing he sprayed is still making me dizzy! We know who it is. - Who's it? Dr. Purushothaman's family's alive. Where are we going now? To Duraipandi's house. - It's Saturday. He won't be there.

Hey, you know who we are, right? - Yes, I do. If what you have said isn't there, I'll bury you alive. Stop it. Did you shoot the video of us watching the show? Yes. - How much do you want? The price of the ticket you paid. - Rs. Five lakhs? With all seven in it, totally Rs. 35 lakhs. What's this smoke all about? Hey, who's that? Mister! Mister.. - Nishanth! Run! - Mister! Nishanth! Nishanth! - Run! Nishanth! Nishanth! Stop the vehicle.. Leave me.. Judas, listen to me. - JK, where's the kid? Where's the kid? He is safe. Take him to a safe place. Take care of Nishanth. - Let nobody else know of this. Take care of Nishanth. Judas.. Help me.. JK, save him. Save that kid. He'll be safe. - No. They'll die. After it is done, they'll commit suicide. After what? - Their work. The cleaning they're doing. Judas, don't talk. No, I must. The family won't talk. No one should talk ill of that family. Judas! Constable, get us an auto. What for? - Let's go to the hospital. No, I'm dying. A bullet has entered my pericardial sac. It will create a tamponade. Another bullet has blown my descending colon. Can't you smell it? And my blood group is AB negative. It is very rare. You can't get it easily. Don't try to save me. JK, I helped that family. I know. It's very late, right? Judas! I am indebted to them. For protecting my child for four years. When my child was buried Purushothaman gave Suja into my hands. He said, 'It is your child'. JK, wouldn't you be happy if you got back your sister? But when our child Suja came back, we couldn't be happy. We couldn't be happy! When Suja was lost, we searched for three days. And prayed to every God. And when we thought that all was lost.. Who's it? - Is this the Doctor's house? Yes. - While coming back from work I saw the girl near the railway crossing. I asked her where she wanted to go. Suja! Suja.. Suja.. God! The hands that touched dead women to see whether they were raped I touched a young child! I touched my own child! The mother asked me what had happened. I told her that her daughter's body has been ruined. My eyes got sore from shedding tears. Oh, no! Oh, no! Suja! For three days, the mother was looking at her dead girl. Mister, we need a help from you. Will you help us? What? - We should die. We can't live anymore. We want to join our child. Will you help us? We want to die. We need to die. We can't live anymore.. We need to die. Purosh! Purosh.. What are you doing? What are you doing? Y-You said that we should die, right? Yes. I did. But we must kill everyone who killed our child. We should die after killing every one of them.. Mister, will you help us? We need to kill them.. We need to kill everyone. Will you help us? - Help for death.. Will you help us? - ...help for murder. I understood what justice is. I brought three corpses from the mortuary. The family that had lived in a beautiful house buried its child in that disgusting place and stayed there. The peaceful family that don't understand violence and never harmed a person started preparing for a hunt. A man-hunt. First, Jon Britto who had falsely accused Purushothaman of bribery was kidnapped. Secondly, the lab attender, Manikantan who had falsely accused Annapoorani of sexual harassment. They both confessed that they were bribed by auto driver Nagu and Rajamanickam to lie. After investigating Nagu we learned that him and Murthy together had orchestrated Nishanth's accident with the auto and had called Suja from his phone and had made her come out of the dance class and had abducted her. They raped our child and threw her in the streets. Not only our child. We learnt that many girls were being kidnapped by Thirisangu, Inba and Isakkimuthu and put on peep shows in which they raped the girls for those old and withered men. Suja! Suja! The family that had been human until hearing about it became beasts. Judas.. Life is not a heaven, JK. It's a hell.. What would you have done? What would you have done if it were you? In every man's cage of conscience, there's a beast prowling about. This is what happens when it breaks out. Never do wrong. Do not hurt others. God is watching over us. Practice non-violence. People who live by these good acts are being chased by men with wealth, power, ruffians political power and police power. How long can you run? There's no way to run now. I turned back. I chase them now. Run now! I don't fear death. I died ages ago. Run as far as you can. I'll come for you. If it's possible to commit crimes with a tiny amount of intelligence just imagine what a person with immense knowledge can do. That's why we hacked them and put it in the streets. Your sister, your daughter.. If this happens to them.. Won't you.. Won't you do the same thing? Won't you kill them? Won't you hack the wrongdoer to pieces? Judas.. Judas.. Where is the doctor and his wife? You know, the Judas in the Bible was a betrayer. But I am the Judas Iscariot to those angels to the end. Judas.. Judas.. He is not saying anything. - There's nothing more to say. What? - Judas has told everything. Where's he? - He's dead. Did you record what he said? - No. Was there any doctor with you while Judas was speaking? I asked you. Did you have a doctor with you? No, sir. - What do you mean? Being a CBCID officer don't you know that a doctor should be present when a dying declaration is given? Charu! This is Kittappa speaking! Hello? Charu! Darling! W-Where are you? - I don't know, Brother. I don't know where I am. - Give it here. JK. Hey, listen to me first. Ask me what I need before returning your sister back. I need that boy with the shaved head. I need to know where his family is. Sir, Charu is alive! My sister is alive! My sister is alive. - Who's on the line? Charu? My sister's alive. Hello, this is the DSP. Who's speaking? Darn you! Who are you to give me orders? I'll twist your neck. Are you trying to blackmail me? I won't give you anyone. Please, sir. - Kittappa, trace out this number. Hello? Hello? Hello, this is JK here. Sir, please. Don't harm my sister. Please. Sir? Okay, sir.. Hello? Sir, I need my sister back. Please help me. What? Do you want me to give the boy to them? Sir, I have been searching for my sister everywhere. I need my sister back. I'll take the boy and bring him back safely. P-Please consider my request. Only our department knows that the boy is here. Will you shut your mouth? No, I meant.. - You are a police officer. Don't bend the law for your personal interests. Sir, I don't see anything else. I see only my sister. You can go. No more bull shitting!. Kittappa, guard the boy. - Okay, sir. We have to hand him over to the IG tomorrow. - Yes, sir. Sir? - You can go. I said, you can go! Trace out that number soon. Sir, here's your mobile phone. Sorry, sir. Did the boy eat anything? I asked him all night. But he never said anything. It's the DSP. Hello? Yes, it's me, JK. Yes. No, I don't know where his parents are. He hasn't answered anything. My parents are at Palaniappa Mills. Hello? My sister is coming along, right? Where? - Palaniappa Mills, Ennore. I'll bury the whole family today. I already have a gun. That is an official one. Use this instead. Mother! Hey, where are your parents? Hey, Inba! Don't let him go.. I'll kill him myself. Hold him tight. Don't let him go.. Hey, how dare you throw mud on my face! I'll kill you now. I'll kill you now. - Hey, Isakkimuthu! Where are you? - Duraipandi, what happened? What happened to your eyes? - What's happening here? Who did this to you? - I can't see anything. - Hey! Tell me.. - Save me. Father! - Old rascal! Father! - Will you stab me? I'll kill you. I'll bury you today. I'll bury you! Where's your wife? Where.. Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Charu! JK, come! Do you want your sister? Drop your guns and kneel before me. Come on! Drop them. Everyone! Mother! Suja! - Let my child go.. Brother! Brother! Suja! Mother.. Father.. Mother! Father! Mother! Father! Mother! 'Out of the seven men against whom the crimes have been proved' 'six are sentenced to seven year imprisonment' 'while Duraipandi, being the major criminal' 'is sentenced to 13 years of imprisonment.' 'Moreover, the false testifiers in this investigation' 'Jon Britto and Manikantan' 'are sentenced to three years of imprisonment' 'by this court.' 'CBCID Officer, J. Krishnamurti, who let the accused escape while being on duty, Sub Inspectors, Tamizhselvi Prakash and Head constable, Kittappa are ordered to be temporarily suspended from work by this court. Further, the CBCID has ordered to find out the missing convict, Nishanth by this court. Hello, Mister. Thanks for the book. Nishanth, you have suffered a lot in your young age. Man's life is full of sufferings. Even though it was known that Judas's daughter would die your father kept her alive for four years. Ask yourself why your father did it. You will find the answer. I don't know what else to say. Good luck. - Thank you, Mister. Bye. Your full name please. - Mahesh. Mahesh Muthuswamy. Happy journey. - Thanks.
