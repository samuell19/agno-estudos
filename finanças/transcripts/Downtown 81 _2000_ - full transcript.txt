Fairy tales can come true. Sometime it might happen to you. Especially when you're young in New York. But once upon a time this place was the wild frontier, and every youngster who was fast on the draw showed up on these streets to try his hand. Anyway, the story you are about to see isn't true, but it isn't false either. Any resemblance between the characters and events depicted here and reality is purely magical. I awoke. Had I been dreaming? I think so. I tried to remember, but it slipped away. But I remembered this place. Here I was again. Back where I started. How long had it been this time? Days, weeks, months, years? Hard to say. Time is different on the inside. It gets light, it gets dark. How many times? But somehow I knew this day would be different. It was the doctor. He examined me. He looked at me like I was a slide under a microscope. Like I was a germ. Dangerous. But he said that I was cured You're cured! He said that I was free to go. You're free to leave now. He said I was free. He was right, but he had no idea. Excuse me! Got my stuff? I was glad to say goodbye to that place. Sign here. - That is his paperwork. - Yes. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye-bye. - I won't see you! Yeah! I was free, but the city wasn't. The subway fare had gone up. But that was okay. I knew my way downtown, and walking was deluxe. It meant time was on my side. The streets looked really good to me. They looked like art. Marble and tar, oil and steel, chrome and glass. Money like fly paper. Solid gold tiles. Neon literature. Nature pushing through the concrete. I wanted to paint the town red. Paint the town black. And the earth was formless, void, darkness upon the face of the deep. The spirit moved across the water and there was light. It was good. It was good. And the earth was formless, void, darkness upon the face of the deep. The spirit moved across the water and there was light. It was good. New York is my kind of town If you can make it there, you can sell people your unwanted hair. There was a diamond brick road there and I could see it. I was off to be the Wizard. I felt like I didn't have a care in the world, 'cause I didn't. I had interests. Anatomy, plutonium, Lazarus. Sherlock Holmes, hieroglyphics, Popeye. Are not princes, kings ancient and honorable, neither sword nor spear dispersed into the four corners of the earth. For the sickles, for the mattocks, for the forks, for the axes. And the earth was formless, void, darkness upon the face of the deep. The spirit moved across the water and there was light. It was good. You gotta blow your own horn in this town. New York, New York. Gotham City, The Big Apple. - May I help you? - Apple, please! That's a quarter. Heads or tails? Ah, heads. Thanks. The city looked big and I felt big 'cause I was part of the landscape. I'm an artist. When you tell people that, they usually say: What's your medium? I usually say: Extra large. Then I met her. I had never seen her before. There was something I liked about her. I felt like I already knew her. Hi. Can I offer you a lift downtown? She knew I was on my way downtown Get in. That's so impolite. Her name is Beatrice. She's a model. She makes more money in one day than I made in the last year. Her job is standing still or walking. She had just arrived from Milan. I couldn't take my eyes off her. The feeling was mutual. I told her that she seemed really familiar. She said maybe I had seen her pictures in the magazines. I don't think so. Maybe a billboard, but... Maybe I had seen her picture. She had enough of them. There were hundreds of magazine pictures in her portfolio. Each one had been reproduced a million times. There were billions of Beatrice all over the world. So maybe that was how I knew her. But then she said she had the same feeling about me. You know, Jean, I have the same feeling about you. I feel that you're someone I already know. She hadn't seen me in the magazines. She figured maybe it was in another life. She told me that she knew I was a great artist. She said it was written all over my face. She said that I shouldn't have to struggle anymore. Why don't you let me take care of you for the rest of your life? I didn't even know I'd been struggling, but I guess that's what artists are supposed to do. And I didn't want to disappoint her. She was beautiful, she was rich, she wanted me! Hey, hope to see you later. Bye. Ciao. Hey, hey, hey, I caught you, little sneak! Come back here, man, come back here. Where do you think you're going? I'm going up to my apartment. It's not your apartment. It has never been, it is not now, and it will never be your apartment. - It's my apartment! - You can't evict me. I was in the hospital. You owe me $422.60, including legal. Right. Oh, kid! Hey, you locked me out. Come on, man, you can't do that. It's illegal. Let me in. You don't pay rent, you don't live here. Pay me and I'll let you in. How can I pay you if I can't get into my apartment, huh? You mean you have $420 in there? Oh, ho, ho. Then we can work it out. That's all you had to say. Just give me the cash. Cash! Money order, certified check. Cash is better. You got cash? Okay, if you don't have the money, you will be out on the street tomorrow. It's over there. Wait a second, wait a second. What is this? This thing is worth $420? This is it! - I have a buyer. - That's it. Get out! Out, out, out. What do you think I am, David Rockefeller? Leo Castelli or something? I want cash! Back on the street again. The Lower East Side. Looked like a war zone. Like we dropped the bomb on ourselves. But it was okay. I'd met a beautiful woman, and she'd pick me up for a night or two. I found enough money in my apartment to buy a joint. All I had to do was sell this painting for 500 bucks. Why not? You can get anything you want here if you try. And you can get plenty of what you don't want too. If you're not careful. Hey, brother, I got Dr. Nova, I got BT-82. One bag, it'll fuck you up, bro. I'm sure, all right? What do you want? I got the green, I got coke, I got gimmicks. Tell me what you need! A good question, but none of his business. If you wanna see something ugly, you never have too far to go. But if you wanna find something beautiful, well, that's not too hard either. In this town, anything is possible. Around here you have to think big just to survive. It can be a jungle and it can be a paradise too. And sometimes you can't tell the difference. - Boom. - Hey, my man! How you doing? I got the smoke. Weed that's guaranteed. Joints and bags. Check it out. See you around, you know where I'm at. Need a match? Okay, see you around. Hey, Joe, wanna go out? No, thanks, I'm already out. I'm known around here. People know my name. Hey, Jean. Hey, Jean, you know we're at the Mudd Club tonight! I'm loved. And I'm respected. But not everybody loves and respects me. Hey you! You wrote on my fan, man! I'm gonna get you, punk! Hey, sexy, you like it? It's art! Hey man, that's private property! Hey, my man! I'm a tax payer, I can paint anywhere I wanna paint. Besides it's legal. Another commission? Sort of a commission. We're doing it for some friends of ours. It's half commission, half donation. Who's inside? Yeah, this DJ from the Bronx, man. Any good? He's serious, man. You wanna check him out. You missed a spot.

This is really nice! Thanks! You wanna sell it? You wanna buy it? I'd like to buy one, but I can't even afford your paintings. I'd give it to you for free, if you'd take me with it. No, but I know someone who would wanna buy it, and she'd probably wanna take you with it. You know Mrs. Cavalcanti? I don't know. Do I? I'll give you her number. Just write it on the back.

They are multiplying. Cloning. Why, they don't even have different faces. And I say, if that's the face of the future, I don't want to have anything to do with it. Sounds like you've been to the future already. Well, we artists have managed to keep the last bit of intelligence and beauty going. And before they know what hit them, ugliness and stupidity will stamp themselves out. Don't you think they just might stamp out everything by accident? We certainly have our work cut out for us. You don't know how refreshing it is to find someone that understands the basics. Why, we'll turn this world around yet. ♪ He is so beautiful ♪ ♪ So intelligent, so humorous ♪ ♪ He is divine ♪♪ Oh, yeah, baby! Give it to me, give it to me. I'll have one of those.

Oh. You're so hot, you're on fire! Stupid asshole. My drink, my suit! God, I can't believe this thing. It's okay. Look, you're not going anywhere. Yes I am. I say you dance until the other chick shows! Look, buster, your time is up! Now, wait, hold it, okay? What are you going to do about it? - Expired. - This was made in Hong Kong. I didn't have anything to do with that, man. Just hold on a second, I'll be right with you. Hi, honey! I can't believe these animals! Sorry I'm late, Mac. - Hi. - Catherine, - this is. - You're all wet. Sir, I'm sorry about your suit. Let's get out of here. Creep! I should have been a waitress. I hate it when they undress you with their eyes. That's it. Never again. Never again! This time it's for sure. I'm done with it. It's all behind me now. I've broken my back carrying heavy amplifiers. People see me up on stage and think I'm trying to strike a sexy pose. Little do they know just getting there is a workout. I get to the club hours early so that my fans won't see me carrying my own equipment. And then I have to stay until the place closes just to get paid. Okay, so that's half the door up to 11:00. That's $300, and so then we take out $50 for the PA, $170 for the ads in the papers, $40 even for the drinks the band had at the bar. By the way, son, that beer is on you. In the beginning it was fun, but then the club owner sees you up on the stage having fun and says, "Well, you're having fun up there! Why should I pay you?" They'll do it every time. Did you take out social security and withholding? That's up to you. So you work two jobs just so you can have a little bit of time for rehearsal. You do a great concert, and the people come, the press comes, and they write about you. They say, "The band was unrehearsed, the personality was totally affected." Then, finally, the record people come. You know what? I think your act is really great and I like it very much, but I can't sign you! Not for now! Today I can only sign up acts that are proven formulas. I can see you have tremendous potential, but it's just like a gold mine. You take the raw ore, then you have to refine it and refine it and refine it. And then, after that, you know what you've got? A gold coke spoon? That's it, kid. You got the right attitude. Someday you and me are gonna go places together. So you keep playing and practicing, and a few smart people notice... and make you an offer. Not a great offer... but it's an offer. It's the standard contract. Nothing complicated about it. And all the usual clauses. Um, I'll take it home and read it. There's really no need to read it. It's the same contract the Bee Gees signed. Maybe I should get a lawyer to look at it. He'll tell you the same thing I'm telling you, and I already have a check drawn up. Okay, well... Well, let me just give it a quick read. Okay, but hurry up, the bank closes in eight minutes and Monday is a holiday. I'll be on the coast all next week. It was great in the beginning. Then it was fun. But now it takes up all my time. I could've been a great surgeon. Well, that's that. What a relief. Now maybe I'll have time to finish my painting. Never again. Never again. Hi. What's going on? Why are you just sitting here? I was going to do some painting. You can't do that! We have rehearsal time at the studio. Ten minutes to get there. Oh. Ten minutes? Oh, all right. Darling! Darling. Hello. Sit. It's good to see you again, Mrs. Cavalcanti. Call me Vanda, darling. Okay, Vanda, darling! You're so funny, Jean! The night we met you were absolutely hilarious. I was? I can't believe you've been such a stranger. Anything else, ma'am? Yeah, give me a double. What have you been doing? I want to hear everything about you. Well, I was in a hospital for a while, but I'm okay now. No, in the hospital? What happened to you? It was kind of weird, I mean, these doctors were coming with med students. I felt like a slide in a microscope. Oh, poor Jean! I can imagine. Well, it's good... It's good to be back at work again, I mean, painting and stuff. Even better than before. Oh, I can see. It's absolutely marvelous! So strong, so savage! Yeah, pretty raw, huh? I love these olives. You're so funny! Is everything okay? Great. So I ran into Claudia on the street. She said you wanted to buy one of my paintings. Oh, yes. I do. I need one of yours to hang in the dining room. It's a marvelous spot. Do you think you have a pink one? I'll have to take a look. Oh, you know what I should do? I should come to your studio and see everything. My place is kind of messed up right now. They're fixing it up a little bit. Oh, I know how artists are. I made that painting specially for you. It's one of my favorites. So, how much? $500. Ah, you know rich people... They never have cash on them. Take this, and I'll write you a check for the rest. Then when I come back you will make me a pink one perhaps? Yeah, okay. Che bello! Jean, I know you have to run, but I'll see you soon. Ciao, genio! I could see the handwriting on the wall. It was mine. I've made my mark in the world, and it's made its mark on me. I'm a writer. But sometimes I feel like I was written. "You see that guy," they say, "he's a real character." But maybe I wrote myself. That's life. Write, write, rewrite. You start writing. Maybe you only have one word. You don't know what's next. You don't know where it will end. But one thing leads to another. Hey, where are you going with our equipment? Where are you going? Hey, hey, wait! Hey, man, let's go! I hope you're not going uptown. I don't think so. Let's go! Where to? Follow that van! I need a destination. I don't know where, just follow the van. Look, I don't follow vans. You're yellow! Sonny, you have to be on your toes in this town.

He jumped me from behind, dragged me inside, tied me up. He took everything! Now who would do something like this? A thief, a thief would do something like this! Of course a thief, but why us? Come on, Jean, he wanted our stuff. Why not from someone who has it, like Kiss or The Ramones or something? 'Cause they have security, man! What do we have? Will you untie me? Mm, I think it was another band. Yeah? Somebody playing tomorrow night. Nah, come on. - Well, you let another band practice here. - Will you untie me? Or it was an inside job.

Not your own band! No. Like a rival band who's maybe playing tomorrow night. Tomorrow night? There's this punk rock band playing, The Felons. They're rehearsing right now down in the basement. You know the basement. The budget basement. - Okay. - You should check it out. Maybe it's one of them. - Thanks for the coffee. - Don't worry, it's safe. Don't mind me. I'm just looking for something. What is it? Hey, man, what are you doing here, man? - Somebody stole our equipment. - He's stealing our concept. You know anything about it?

What do you mean "small time"? Yeah, you know what I mean, lousy equipment. Who'd wanna steal your stuff? Who? At first I thought it was a maniac, but now I think it's a major record company. - How come? - They used to just not sign guys like you. Now they wanna destroy you. - A piece of chicken? - Yeah. Wanna come down and see The Plastics? - That's okay. - I'll see you later. Bye. Konichi wa! Hello! Hello! Hi, konichi wa.

But the only way to be is in the present. That's what my daddy always said to me. Hi, Jean! Where have you been all night, huh? Around. You just didn't see me. It was crowded. Yeah, your life looks pretty crowded. I think... I think I'm gonna take care of myself. Well, I got to go. Sometimes you feel like life is killing you. That's life. I thought I'd take a walk down a dark alley. Maybe I'd run into myself. Hey, sonny! Sonny! Sonny! Could you come a little bit closer? I want to ask you a favor. Yeah. What do you want? A kiss! You're a nice man. Would you kiss me goodnight? - What? - Just one... - Are you crazy? - little kiss. Please! I don't know if I'm really your type. There's something I want to tell you. - What? - Come a little closer, please. I'm a fairy princess and I'm under a spell. If you kiss me goodnight, then I'll grant you every wish. Just one, please! Hey, it was such a great kiss, I really thought you were a princess. Now watch this, baby! Oh! Thanks! I thought I'd never get out. You have no idea what a drag it is being a bag lady. You know, baby, it's really tough getting a decent kiss these days. I really can't thank you enough for getting me out of that mess. So I'll grant you your every wish. That's the least I could do. Boom. Boom for real! Was I dreaming? No. Maybe I was just waking up. Waking up to my own luck. Luck is where you find it. And the earth was formless and void, darkness upon the face of the deep. The spirit moved across the water and there was light. It was good. It was good. Most people don't know how to make a wish, nor what to wish for. - I wish they did. - And the earth was a formless void, darkness upon the face of the deep, and the spirit moved across the water and there was light. It was good. - Chesterfield Kings. - I got princes, kings, ancient and honorable, neither sword, nor spear, dispersed into the four corners of the earth. - Nice El Dorado. - Thanks, guy. - Want to sell it? - Nah.

Man, keep the change. Across the water and there was light. - That's a deal. - Bye! Bye! And the earth was formless and void, darkness upon the face of the deep.
