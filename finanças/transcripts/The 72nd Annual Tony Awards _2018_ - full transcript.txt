LIVE FROM DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES, IT'S THE 72nd EMMY AWARDS. PLEASE WELCOME YOUR HOST, JIMMY KIMMEL! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪ WELL, HELLO, AND WELCOME TO THE PANDEMMYS. IT'S GREAT TO FINALLY SEE PEOPLE AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR RISKING EVERYTHING TO BE HERE. THANK ME FOR RISKING EVERYTHING TO BE HERE. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, YOU CAN'T HAVE A VIRUS WITHOUT A HOST. THE BIG QUESTION I THINK WE SHOULD ANSWER IS WHY WOULD YOU HAVE AN AWARDS SHOW IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC? SERIOUSLY, I'M ASKING. WHY ARE WE HAVING AN AWARDS SHOW IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC? AND WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING HERE? THIS IS THE YEAR THEY DECIDE THEY HAVE TO HAVE A HOST? WHY IS A QUESTION I'VE BEEN ASKED A LOT THIS WEEK. AND I GET IT, IT MIGHT SEEM FRIVOLOUS AND UNNECESSARY, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE SEEMS FRIVOLOUS AND UNNECESSARY? DOING IT EVERY OTHER YEAR. WHAT IS HAPPENING TONIGHT IS NOT IMPORTANT. IT'S NOT GOING TO STOP COVID OR PUT OUT THE FIRES, BUT IT'S FUN. AND RIGHT NOW, WE NEED FUN. THIS HAS BEEN A MISERABLE YEAR. IT'S BEEN A YEAR OF DIVISION, INJUSTICE, DISEASE, ZOOM SCHOOL, DISASTER, AND DEATH. WE'VE BEEN QUARANTINED AND LOCKED DOWN, CONFINED TO OUR HOMES LIKE PRISONERS. WHAT DID WE FIND IN THAT DARK AND LONELY TUNNEL? WE FOUND A FRIEND WHO IS THERE FOR US 24 HOURS A DAY. OUR OLD PAL, TELEVISION. THAT'S RIGHT. TELEVISION IS YOUR FRIEND, IT'S YOUR BIG BROTHER, YOUR SISTER, YOUR MAMA'S FAMILY, YOUR TWO DADS, THREE SONS, CRAZY EX‐GIRLFRIEND, EVEN YOUR DOG, THE BOUNTY HUNTER. TELEVISION IS THERE FOR YOU, EVERY DAY OF YOUR 600‐POUND LIFE. THE WORLD MAY BE TERRIBLE, BUT TV HAS NEVER BEEN BETTER. AND TONIGHT, WE ARE PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE GREAT SHOWS AND THE HISTORY MAKING NOMINEES. HATS OFF TO THE TELEVISION VISIONARY NORMAN LEAR, THE OLDEST WINNER EVER AT AGE 98. NORMAN DIDN'T GROW UP DREAMING OF WINNING EMMYS. IN FACT, TELEVISION WASN'T SOMETHING PEOPLE HAD UNTIL HE WAS A TEENAGER. WHEN HE HWAS A BOY, HIS DREAM WS NOT TO GET KICKED TO DEATH BY A HORSE. NORMAN, YOU ARE A MIRACLE. THE ONLY THING I'LL BE PRODUCING WHEN I'M 98 IS PHLEGM. CONGRATULATIONS ARE ALSO IN ORDER FOR A YOUNG UPSTART NAMED QUIBI, WHICH HAS TEN NOMINATIONS THIS YEAR, INCLUDING DUMBEST THING TO EVER COST $1 BILLION. THERE WERE SO MANY GREAT DRAMAS THIS YEAR, AND COMEDIES, TOO. A LITTLE SHOW FROM OUR FRIENDLY NEIGHBORS UP NORTH IS UP FOR EVERY EMMY. 15 NOMINATIONS FOR "SCHITT'S CREEK." BY THE WAY, YOU'RE GOING TO BE SEEING THAT LOGO A LOT. IN ORDER TO MEET BROADCAST STANDARDS, THE SENSORS HAVE DECIDED EVERY TIME I SAY THAT, WE'RE REQUIRED TO PUT "SCHITT'S CREEK" ON THE SCREEN. HBO CAN SHOW YOU A BLUE PENIS, NO PROBLEM. I CAN'T SAY THAT WORD. AND SPEAKING OF BLUE PENISES, "WATCHMEN" HAS 26 NOMINATIONS. IT'S A SUPERHERO SHOW, VERY REALISTIC EXCEPT FOR THE PART WHERE ANYONE IN OKLAHOMA IS WEARING A MASK. ISN'T "WATCHMEN" ALSO WHAT JERRY FALWELL JR. WAS INTO? HEY, WAS THAT ME? WAIT. IF I'M DOWN THERE, HOW AM I UP HERE? THAT WOULD MEAN THAT NO ONE IS IN THE AUDIENCE. THAT WOULD MEAN THAT I'M UP HERE ALL ALONE. JUST LIKE PROM NIGHT. OF COURSE I'M HERE ALL ALONE. OF COURSE WE DON'T HAVE AN AUDIENCE. THIS ISN'T A MAGA RALLY, IT'S THE EMMYS. INSTEAD OF A LIVE AUDIENCE, WE TOOK A PAGE FROM BASEBALL AND FILLED THE SEATS WITH CARDBOARD CUTOUTS OF THE NOMINEES. WE HAVE REGINA, HUGH, JASON, MERYL ‐‐ WAIT A MINUTE. GO BACK ONE. JASON? JASON? I KNOW IT'S YOU. I SAW YOUR EYES MOVING. THEY DIDN'T MOVE. YES, THEY DID MOVE. MIND YOUR BUSINESS, KIMMEL. BIG NIGHT FOR ME. I KNOW IT'S A BIG NIGHT, BUT YOU CAN'T BE IN HERE. WE HAVE VERY STRICT SAFETY PROTOCOLS. I'M CLEAN, GUY. I'M A BIG WASHER‐UPPER. SMELL MY HANDS. THEY'RE LIKE A GARDEN. I'M SURE YOU'RE CLEAN. WE JUST HAVE A LIMIT ON HOW MANY PEOPLE WE CAN HAVE IN THE BUILDING. YOU NEED TO GO. NO, I DON'T. I HAVEN'T LEFT THE HOUSE FOR SIX MONTHS. I WANT TO BE HERE, I WANT TO EAT SHRIMP WITH THE CAST OF "THE CROWN." I WANT MARIO LOPEZ TO ASK ME ABOUT MY PANTS. LET'S GO. YOU CAN STAY, AS LONG AS YOU PROMISE TO LAUGH AT MY JOKES. HUH. I'M OUT. I'M GOING TO CALL A CAR. YOU'RE NOMINATED, YOU KNOW. I KNOW. IF I WIN, GIVE IT TO CHEADLE. WHEN WAS THAT PHOTO TAKEN? IT'S TOUGH. I DON'T AGE. LET'S GET GOING. BUT FIRST, LET'S HAVE A STANDING OVATION FOR ME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. IT'S TOO MUCH. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. HERE'S HOW THE SHOW WILL WORK. OR NOT. WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO DO SOMETHING THAT HAS NEVER BEEN ATTEMPTED BEFORE. AND FOR GOOD REASON. INSTEAD OF BRINGING THE NOMINEES TO US, WE WENT TO THEM. WE HAVE LIVE FEEDS TO AND FROM MORE THAN 100 LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD. YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO GET YOUR PAIRENTS TO FACETIME? MULTIPLY THAT A LOT. THIS IS WHERE THE MAGIC HAPPENS. THIS IS THE NERVE CENTER. WE'VE TAKEN EVERY SAFETY PRECAUTION, AND THESE ARE TONIGHT'S NOMINEES. HELLO, EVERYONE, AND CONGRATULATIONS. THEY'RE ALL STANDING BY. WE'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU FOR WEEKS NOW, WITH CAMERAS AND MICROPHONES IN YOUR HOMES. HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE ALREADY STARTED DRINKING? SHOW OF HANDS. VERY GOOD. I FEEL LIKE I'M IN A BEST BUY. THIS IS WONDERFUL. SO HERE'S HOW THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN. IF YOU WIN, WE'LL HAVE A GUY DRIVE TO YOUR HOUSE AND CHUCK THE EMMY THROUGH YOUR WINDOW. NO, WE WON'T DO THAT, BUT WE WILL BE CONNECTED TO EVERYONE THROUGHOUT THE SHOW, HOPEFULLY. THIS IS THE SHOW THAT WILL FINALLY ANSWER THE QUESTION, DOES ALAN ARKIN KNOW HOW TO USE A WEBCAM? WE DON'T HAVE AN ORCHESTRA THIS YEAR, BUT D‐NICE IS SPINNING THE HITS ALL NIGHT LONG. LET'S GIVE OUT SOME EMMY AWARDS. LET'S DO IT. YOU KNOW, NOT EVERYONE STAYED AT HOME TONIGHT.

WHAT? AT THEIR HOUSES? YEAH. BUT I'M HERE. OH. RIGHT. YOU SHOULDN'T BE, BECAUSE YOU'RE NOMINATED. BECAUSE YOU WON'T GET IT IF YOU'RE NOT AT HOME. JIMMY, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

[ APPLAUSE ] AND NOW, PLEASE WELCOME THE CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF THE TELEVISION ACADEMY, FRANK SHERMAN. GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE. TELEVISION AND ITS STORIES HAVE BECOME AN INTRICATE PART OF OUR LIVES. TELEVISION IS NO LONGER JUST A REFLECTION OF THE CULTURE, BUT AN INVALUABLE PART OF THE CULTURE. IN THE MIDST OF AN UNPRECEDENTED GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS, THE ENTIRE WORLD HAS BEEN FORCED TO SPEND MUCH MORE TIME AT HOME THAN EVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE, QUALITY TELEVISION SHOWS HAVE BECOME A FORM OF CURRENCY. WE'RE LOOKING FOR A NEW SHOW TO GET LOST IN OR TO LEARN FROM. AND WE CAN SHARE THE SHOWS AND CONNECT OVER THE STORIES. AND THAT CONNECTION IS PRICELESS TODAY. TELEVISION HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE MEDIUM THAT HELPED US UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER, THE STRUGGLES, THE JOYS, AND THE HEARTACHE. I SEE HOW THAT OPENS OUR EYES AND HOPEFULLY BRINGS US TOGETHER AS A PEOPLE. WE CAN OPEN PORTALS INTO EACH OTHER'S WORLDS, HEAR EACH OTHER'S VOICES, AND SEE OTHER PERSPECTIVES MORE CLEARLY. AND FEW HAVE DONE MORE TO WIDEN THE SCOPE OF TELEVISION THAN TYLER PERRY. THE GOVERNOR'S AWARD WAS CHOSEN BY THE TELEVISION ACADEMY BOARD, A GROUP OF INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS WHO DEDICATE THEIR TIME TO FOSTER EXCELLENCE IN TELEVISION. IT'S ONLY GIVEN OUT WHEN THERE IS A RECIPIENT WHO HAS EXCEEDED THE HIGH STANDARDS OF OUR MEDIUM. AND HONORING MR. PERRY ARE CHRIS ROCK AND OPRAH WINFREY. IN LIFE, WE ARE GIVEN NO GUARANTEES, AND IT TAKES EXTRAORDINARY GRIT AND DEDICATION TO NAVIGATE THE ROUGH TERRAIN THAT LIFE CAN GIVE YOU, AND STILL HAVE THE INTERNAL FORTITUDE TO BELIEVE IN YOURSELF. MY FRIEND, TYLER PERRY, HAS DONE JUST THAT, AGAINST ALL ODDS. HE'S A MAN OF DEEP FAITH. HE'S A VISIONARY WHO IS LED BY UNWAVERING PASSION, AND A BUSINESSMAN WHO BET ON HIMSELF, AND BY DOING SO SHOWED THE WORLD THERE'S A DIFFERENT PATH TO ULTIMATE SUCCESS. TYLER IS THIS YEAR'S RECIPIENT OF THE GOVERNOR'S AWARD, BECAUSE HE DREAMED THE IMPOSSIBLE DREAM. HE BEARED THE UNBEARABLE SORROW, AND FOUGHT THE UNBEATABLE FOE, TO RUN WHERE THE BRAVE DARE NOT GO. HE'S DONE WHAT NO ONE BEFORE HAS ACCOMPLISHED, TO MAKE IT IN HOLLYWOOD AS AN OUTSIDER. KNOWING THE TRADITIONAL HOLLYWOOD WAY WASN'T FOR HIM, HE CARVED HIS OWN PATH. HE WROTE A PLAY. INVESTED HIS OWN MONEY IN IT. AND IT FLOPPED, HARD. I THOUGHT 1,200 PEOPLE WOULD SHOW UP, AND ONLY 30 DID. IT LASTED A WEEKEND. THEN HE LIVED IN A CAR, WHICH SUCKS, BECAUSE TYLER IS 6'5", AND HIS CAR WAS A GEO METRO. LIVING THAT CAN BE A MIGHTY MOTIVATOR. AND A MOTIVATED TYLER PERRY WOULD SOON FIND SUCCESS ON HIS OWN TERMS. AND OF COURSE, HOLLYWOOD WELCOMED AN INDEPENDENT BLACK MAN WITH OPEN ARMS. WAIT, I MISREAD THAT. HOLLYWOOD SAW HIM AS A FAD AND DIDN'T DO [ BLEEP ] TO HELP HIM. HE IS BOTH TALENTED AND CRAZY, FINANCING HIS OWN FILMS, RACKING UP HIT AFTER HIT. IN THE HOOD, THEY SAY I GOT RECEIPTS. AND TYLER HAD RECEIPTS. AND WE DID A FILM, BECAUSE TYLER ENSURED THAT BLACK PEOPLE WOULD BE REPRESENTED IN FRONT OF AND BEHIND THE CAMERA. HIS SETS FELT LIKE WATCHING "BLACK PANTHER." THERE WERE BLACK PEOPLE EVERYWHERE. AND AFTER HE AMASSED $1 BILLION AT THE NORTH AMERICAN BOX OFFICE, HE TURNED HIS EYE TO TELEVISION. AND JUST LIKE HIS FILMS, TYLER PERRY DID TV HIS WAY. HE CREATED A WHOLE NEW BUSINESS MODEL, GETTING TBS TO PURCHASE 100 EPISODES OF "HOUSE OF PAYNE" IN A DEAL WORTH $200 MILLION. HE SHOT THREE TO FOUR EPISODES IN A WEEK. THE MAN THAT ALWAYS FOUND A WAY TO MAKE A WAY. FOREVER INNOVATING, HE DECIDED TO MAKE HIS OWN WAY IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA. HE PURCHASED 330 ACRES OF LAND AND CREATED TYLER PERRY STUDIOS. AND THE DUDE WHO WAS ONCE HOMELESS, ALWAYS KEPT THE TOUGH TIMES IN MIND AND REACHED BACK TO THOSE IN NEED. HIS PHILANTHROPY SAYS HE'S STILL CONNECTED TO HIS FELLOW MAN. HE'S A GAME CHANGER WHO BUILT A SUCCESSFUL EMPIRE WHILE IGNORING EVERY CONVENTIONAL NORM. HE IS A MAVERICK. AN INNOVATOR. HE'S MY BROTHER, AND THIS YEAR'S GOVERNOR'S AWARD RECIPIENT, TYLER PERRY. ♪ [ APPLAUSE ] I WANT TO SAY A VERY SPECIAL THANK YOU TO THE TELEVISION ACADEMY. TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS, TO TIM, ARI, MATT, TO EVERYBODY AT TYLER PERRY STUDIOS AND MY FOUNDATION. THIS IS AMAZING. I DIDN'T EXPECT TO FEEL THIS WAY. WHEN I WAS ABOUT 19, I LEFT HOME AND MY GRANDMOTHER GAVE ME A QUILT THAT SHE HAD MADE. AND THIS QUILT WAS SOMETHING THAT I DIDN'T REALLY CARE FOR. IT HAD ALL THESE DIFFERENT COLORS AND PATCHES IN IT. I WAS EMBARRASSED BY IT. I PUT NO VALUE IN IT AT ALL. WHEN THE DOG GOT WET, I DRIED HIM OFF WITH IT. WHEN I CHANGED THE CAR OIL, I LAID IT ON THE GROUND. I HAD NO RESPECT FOR THIS QUILT. MANY YEARS LATER, I WAS WALKING PAST A FANCY ANTIQUE STORE, AND THERE IN THE WINDOW WAS A QUILT. IT WAS JUST LIKE THE ONE SHE HAD GIVEN ME. AND AN ATTENDANT SAID, THIS WAS MADE BY AN AFRICAN‐AMERICAN WOMAN WHO WAS A FORMER SLAVE. EACH PATCH REPRESENTED A PART OF HER LIFE. ONE WAS FROM THE DRESS SHE WAS WEARING WHEN SHE FOUND OUT SHE WAS FREE, ANOTHER WAS FROM HER WEDDING DRESS WHEN SHE JUMPED THE BROOM. AND AS I WAS HEARING THIS STORY, I BECAME SO EMBARRASSED. HERE I WAS, A PERSON WHO PRIDES MYSELF ON CELEBRATING OUR HERITAGE AND CULTURE, AND I DIDN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE THE VALUE IN MY GRANDMOTHER'S QUILT. I DISMISSED HER WORK AND HER STORY BECAUSE IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE WHAT I THOUGHT IT SHOULD. NOW, WHETHER WE KNOW IT OR NOT, WE ARE ALL SEWING OUR OWN QUILTS WITH OUR THOUGHTS AND BEHAVIORS, OUR EXPERIENCES AND OUR MEMORIES. LIKE IN MY OWN QUILT, WHEN I WAS ABOUT 10 YEARS OLD, I REMEMBER MY FATHER STANDING AT THE DOOR. I WAS WONDERING WHY HE STOOD THERE SO LONG. HE WAS FRUSTRATED AND WALKED AWAY. MY MOTHER SAID HE WAS WAITING FOR THE MAN TO PAY HIM AND HE NEVER DID. THEY NEEDED THE MONEY AT THE TIME. SHE SAID, DON'T YOU EVER STAND BY A DOOR WAITING FOR WHITE FOLKS TO DO NOTHING FOR YOU. NOW, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND. MY MOTHER WASN'T A RACIST. BUT IN HER QUILT, SHE COULDN'T IMAGINE A WORLD WHERE HER SON WAS NOT WAITING BY THE DOOR FOR SOMEONE. SHE COULDN'T IMAGINE ME ACTUALLY BUILDING MY OWN DOOR AND HOLDING IT OPEN FOR THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. SHE COULDN'T IMAGINE ME OWNING LAND THAT WAS ONCE A CONFEDERATE ARMY BASE. WHERE THEY PLOTTED AND PLANNED ON HOW TO KEEP BLACKS ENSLAVED. NOW, ON THAT LAND, BLACK, WHITE, GAY, STRAIGHT, LESBIAN, TRANSGENDER, EX‐CONS, ALL COMING TOGETHER TO ADD PATCHES TO A QUILT THAT REPRESENTS DIVERSITY AT ITS BEST. I STAND HERE TONIGHT TO SAY THANK YOU TO ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CELEBRATING AND KNOW THE VALUE OF EVERY PATCH AND EVERY STORY AND EVERY COLOR THAT MAKES UP THIS QUILT THAT IS OUR BUSINESS. THIS QUILT THAT IS OUR LIVES. THIS QUILT THAT IS AMERICA. BECAUSE IN MY GRANDMOTHER'S QUILT, THERE WERE NO PATCHES THAT REPRESENTED BLACK PEOPLE ON TELEVISION. BUT IN MY QUILT, HER GRANDSON IS BEING CELEBRATED BY THE TELEVISION ACADEMY. I THANK YOU FOR THIS. GOD BLESS YOU. THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] ♪ ♪ WELCOME BACK TO THE EMMYS.
