[ Cheering ] Narrator: On "my big fat American gypsy wedding"... The wedding is off! [Bleep] This wedding. Told you he wasn't [Bleep] marrying Bridget. Well, I'm [bleep] Doing it, Amber. Narrator: ...Past relationships cause havoc for bride-to-be nukkie... I don't know what I want! This is what she's gonna have on. Narrator: ...And a dress creates a family war. Get the [bleep] camera out of my [bleep] face now! captions paid for by discovery communications narrator: High in the mountain state lives one of the most notorious gypsy families in America. Nukkie: My name is nukkie. I live in West Virginia and I'm a gypsy. My family is old-tradition gypsy. Gypsy women, we are very hard workers. We have to cook. We have to clean. We have to make sure our house looks good. We have to make sure everything is done for our husband. Narrator: Guiding her family in the strict gypsy traditions is nukkie's mom, nettie. All right, y'all. Start picking that mess up. Can't let the grass grow under your feet, girls. My name is nettie Stanley. I love that I had nine kids. I would do anything in the world for my family. We have a lot of ups and downs, but we also got one another's back, no matter what. Do you know if you'd listen to me, you'd have a very good life? That's how it works in our world. Do you understand anything I'm saying? - Hello? - I'm listening! Some people find our family fascinating. Some people find it tacky, and really, to be honest, none of us give a [bleep] what the other one thinks. [ Exhales slowly ] [ Cows moo ] Narrator: In just two weeks, nukkie is getting married to Jonas, a non-gypsy, or gorger. Oh, my god. I do love this place. Jonas and i's been together about two months now. I would have it right here, just me and you. We're both crazy about each other. I swear to god. I never knew I could like somebody that fast. I love this old thingy. I don't even know what it is. I think it's for horses. It's where you put the horse on the back, and then two people get in there -- so that's like me on the wedding day. Yeah. Jonas: I used to have attitudes all the time. I always used to be mad, and then when I started talking to her, all that's changed. I've just been calm, laid back. These barn doors can close, and then, like, ta-da. Ta-da! You know, like, "the Princess is here." Nukkie: I love him. I love how his ways, his actions. I love her because... You know how you get that feeling sometimes? It's, like, a weird feeling in your gut. I'm gonna get a tattoo tomorrow. I'm gonna make it about us. It's gonna be a poem thing on my forearm. I'm so excited about getting married because it's to the man of my dreams. Narrator: To help her with the wedding, nukkie has enlisted big sister Dallas as maid of honor. That's a good dad right there. Push him up the hill. Narrator: Dallas lives with her three kids and her gypsy sweetheart, Jay. Dallas: My name's Dallas. I'm a romany girl from West Virginia. My day-to-day job, like, period, is being a mom to three kids. I love my gypsy lifestyle. You used to be wild. - Wild? What do you mean wild? - Really wild. I was not wild. Adventurous. Me and Jay has been together for about seven years, since I was 15. We was, like, childhood sweethearts and we clicked. We gave each other some space to see if it was true love, and we came back and, you know, everything is good now. It's nice out here, but it's windy. - I'm cold. - Yeah, I know. Me and Jay are more of a power couple. We're stronger together. She's the mother of my kids. I love everything about Dallas. Narrator: But Dallas and Jay's romance hasn't always fired on all cylinders. They originally got together seven years ago, but after their first child together, Jay left Dallas and married her cousin, Annie. During his marriage with Annie, Dallas gave birth to two more children, which Dallas claims are Jay's. Now Jay's left Annie and gone back to Dallas. This resulted in a bitter feud between Dallas and Annie, which came to a head at nukkie's bridal shower. There's a girl fight [bleep]. - Oh, no. Oh, no. - What happened? Amanda, don't jump! Man: Calm down. Calm down. Stop. Get her off. - Get her off. - No! Man: Shut the door. Shut the door. They did. Look at my eye, Mellie. Hey, turn that off. Narrator: Now Annie's left town. Dallas and Jay are happier than ever, and nukkie's wedding can go ahead as planned. Next on the list is ordering the perfect gypsy dress, and she has a line to the best in the business. - Hey, sondra. - Hey! What's up? I need you to make me a dress. I made you a wedding dress. There's another wedding. Okay, didn't know that didn't work out. Narrator: Five years ago, nukkie thought she'd found true love with a gypsy boy called pookie, but her mother, nettie, didn't approve, and the young lovebirds ran away. They married and later had a son. Me and pookie really, really loved each other strongly, but after I had my boy, we went south from each other. He wanted to go party with the boys, never come home. I was all by myself, and one day, I just left. My son is 2 years old, and I don't see him. Man: Can you tell me about that? I don't want to talk about that. Man: Okay. Boy, have I been out of the loop. - Oh, you sure have. - So who's this? How did you meet him? His name is Jonas. I met him through my sister. It's country zing meets gypsy bling. - Okay. - My dress -- I want it to be a half top, and I want -- I'll have nothing but rhinestones and glitter all over it, and I want it to be all white with baby, baby pink diamonds, and I want the back of the train to be huge. Okay, I'll drop the schedule just for you, my love. All right. Thank you, sondra. Bye-bye. This dress -- I want to outdo my last dress. I want to make it 10 times better, 10 times sexier, because I got my dream guy, and that better be my dream dress. Narrator: The state of West Virginia has long been home to romanichal gypsies, including another family right across town, and its modern gypsy mom, Jett. Jett: I'm Jeanette small. I'm a romanichal gypsy. I was brought up traditional gypsy ways. We try to outdo everyone. We've got to look better, be better. It's just our way. Narrator: Jett lives with her daughters, Victoria and Scarlett, two gypsy princesses in the making. They know everything that there is to know about a romanichal girl. Victoria thinks she's a full-blown woman. She's the first one to pose for the camera. Your hair bow pretty. Scarlett, she's a miracle baby. She was premie. She was born three months early. I had to be in the hospital with her a lot. I'm very lucky Scarlett's alive, so I want to make everyday special for her, and her third birthday, it's very important to me. So I want to throw my Scarlett the biggest third birthday party you guys have ever seen. You're not going to get any better. Yay! Are you ready to go get your nails done? I want everything to be blinged out for this party. Bling is a must. You got to have bling. You see a romanichal, you see bling. All right. Here we go. Narrator: But there's one crucial item that's more important than anything else. Is you gonna be a Princess? I already know it. My idea for her dress at the moment, I'm not sure if I want to do pink or blue, but we do want a big fancy ball gown. I want it to be wow. I'd like for her to pull up in her horse and carriage. She definitely got to have red carpet when she gets out. She's just gonna be a Princess. Narrator: Jett may have clear visions on how she wants Scarlett's dress to be, but someone in this family has other ideas. Angie: I'm Angie. I'm Jett's mom, and I'm a romany gypsy. Do you know, let me tell you something, gypsy tradition is the most importantest thing in my life. I mean, it's everything. It's everything. Scarlett is my granddaughter. She is beautiful. She is so attached to me that it's unreal. I will go through hell to make sure that Scarlett does grow up knowing that she is what you call a pure romany. You ready to chow, mother? Yes, I'm starved. Let's go eat. I just want to get my mom's views for Scarlett's birthday because her and Scarlett are very close, but at the end of the day, my mother is a bitch. She can have a little say here and there, but when it comes down to it, it's my way or no way. All right. So have you picked out a dress or how you're gonna have it done, or what? I've looked at some big fluffy ones, pink. I don't want -- I don't like pink. I don't want pink for her dress. Well, we're doing cinderella themed, so it's got to be pink. I don't want cinderella theme. I'm gonna tell you that right now. I want her to go as a romany, and I want to her to be dressed as a romany that -- what she is. She's not a grown woman. She's gonna be dressed like a little girl. - Yes. - No. She's gonna have a white dress, and it's gonna be silver, and it's gonna be full of bling. - No, sorry, it's not. - Yes. Yeah. Yeah, it is. Narrator: Angie comes from a group of romanies who believe that girls must wear white on their birthday to signify their purity until their coming of age at 16. This is about Scarlett. It's not about you, okay? - This is about Scarlett -- - this is her religion. ...but I'm her mom, and I've got to do what I've got to do. So we need -- no. We need to discuss it because she's not being raised like that. I'm her grandmother. I have just as much say as you have with her. - No, you don't. - Oh, but I do. Oh, but I do. There's not too much you can do about it. You'll see. There's gonna be a lot I'm gonna do about it. This is my granddaughter. She's a gypsy, and it needs to be done the romany way. Get a white dress, blinged out to the Max. I just think she's gonna do crazy colors with the dress. That's not gonna happen. I'm not gonna let it happen. I'm Scarlett's mom. I don't care how she likes it, and I don't care if she likes it, but at the end of the day, it's gonna be the way I want it, and that's just that. My salad is... [ Laughs ] That didn't work. Narrator: News of nukkie's wedding has spread throughout the gypsy community, but not everybody is happy about the upcoming nuptials. Hello? Mnh-mnh. Uh... Narrator: Coming up... Where did you stay last night? Narrator: ...Nukkie is torn between lovers... I love Jonas and I love pookie. I can't help it. Are you [bleep] kidding me? Narrator: ...And Jett sends mom Angie over the edge. [Bleep] You and [bleep] that dress. Narrator: Nukkie's wedding to Jonas is just one week away, but news travels fast in the gypsy community, and nukkie's ex-husband, pookie, the father of her child, is back in town. So you know what this girl has been doing, right? Why she's -- you done got mixed emotions, and pookie's been calling her. Do you know she's thinking about going back to pookie? - No, I haven't. No. - Then what was about -- no. You're not understanding anything, girl. I will beat your brains out like I did to Annie. Do you understand that? That's evil. That's ignorant. Would you get dwarf out of here, telling somebody she's gonna beat their brains out. Mom, I'll beat your brains out. You know what's wrong with her head right now is that pookie's back in town, and she's got mixed emotions. It's what happens when exes -- he needs to stay six hours away. He's secretly manipulating her. I don't want this filmed. Well, too late. It's reality. This is a reality show. - We got to talk about reality. - I'm going to bed! You know, I'd pick Jonas over pookie any day. - I'm sorry to tell you that. - I would, too! But I don't know what I want! Do you want to come -- how about I have Jonas and pookie right here, the two together, and see what you want. No! I don't want nobody out here. Oh, god. You shriek like you're a [bleep] whale. [Bleep] [Bleep], bitch. No. Because you're really -- you're really [bleep] up. I'm confused about what I want. I love Jonas and I love pookie. I can't help it. If I go to pookie, I get my son. That's all that matters to me. I don't care about my feelings. I care just about my son. That's it. Pookie is a two-faced, backstabbing, manipulating person. Pookie put her self-esteem to the ground. I know she has a child there. He took custody, but being away from your kid and then saying that that's the reason why you're going back, that don't work with me. Come on, Scarlett. You excited to get your dress? Narrator: Across town, it's just days until Jett throws daughter Scarlett a third birthday party, gypsy style, but she's shopping for a colorful Princess dress, not a white one like gypsy grandma Angie insisted on. Wow, Scarlett. Look. - Hi. - Look at this dress. Scarlett, she's been through a lot, and I just think she's special, and she deserves to have a nice, special, big party, you know? She's a Princess. She deserves it. The dress, it's got to be perfect, got to be pink. It's got to be big. It's got to have a little bit of bling. I just want a big Princess gown. So these right here are really pretty. - I like these. Scarlett. - What? Which one of these dresses you like, ma? - That one. - You like that one? A lot of beads on it. Perfect for the party. Scarlett, you like that one? A Princess party, to me, is fairy tale, horse and carriage, Princess cake, big fancy dress. Why don't we go ahead and get started trying on? Jett: I'm so nervous. I got to have the best dress, the best look, the best for Scarlett. Here she is. [ Gasps ] I love that! - You can step off. - You look gorgeous! Let me see. Wow! Look at my gorgeous girl. When they open the curtains, and I see my Scarlett for the first time and her pink Princess dress, my heart hit the floor. She was so gorgeous. I could've cried. She was amazing. I looked at her, and I'm like, "man, I made that. That's from me." Now this is a Princess dress. Yes, this is the one. I love this. My mother is going to hate this dress... Wow. ...but I don't care. This is the dress for us. So I'm walking across the parking lot, taking this dress, gonna go hang it up, and who pulls up behind me but my mother, the crazy woman, thinking she looks hot in her Camaro. Are you [bleep] kidding me? That's Scarlett's dress? - You don't like this, mom? - Scarlett is not wearing that. Scarlett is not wearing that under no circumstances. I will not [bleep] have it. You're not gonna take my granddaughter around all my romany family into this party because I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do. So you can put her in it, but I'm taking it off. She -- I will not have it, will not. Don't bring that any closer to me because I will throw it that way. - What's wrong with it? - It's ugly. It's three or four different colors. It looks like it came from a dollar store or something. - You don't like this? - No, I do not. You shouldn't be making decisions without my consent. I have nothing left to say to you. I'm done. That is ugly. I will not have it. I will take care of Scarlett's dress. [Bleep] You and [bleep] that dress. Okay. That woman's crazy. She's absolutely crazy. I'm kind of worried she's gonna come to the party and throw a dramatic fit. [ Tires squeal ] Narrator: While Jett plows on with her plans for Scarlett's party, wedding plans in the Stanley household take an unexpected turn. Mom, nukkie didn't come in last night. - She's not in there? - No. - Yeah, no. - She's not downstairs? - No. - Nope. She doesn't listen. I bet you she won't even answer the phone because she knows I'm calling. Nukkie better have a good explanation why she wasn't home last night. [ Line ringing ] Hello? Where are you at? Getting out of the shower. Where did you stay last night? With pookie? Mom, I'm 20 years old. I don't need no lecture. Oh, you're 20 years old. I don't give a [bleep]. The point is you're not even supposed to be staying with pookie when you're not even with him. Are you out of your [bleep] mind, nukkie? Do you even know what you want? I do know what I want, mom. Leave me alone. Your games have got to stop. Well, leave me alone. You mean to tell me that you're gonna dump your gorger boyfriend, forget about the wedding and go back to pookie after everything pookie's put you through? Are you out of your mind? [ Dial tone ] - There you go. I can't even understand what would get into her mind, to get herself back in that situation. I know she has a child there. That's the only thing I can think of to know that she's there for. But still, it just completely blows my mind. I like being with Jonas, but since pookie got back in town, my mind has been going crazy for him. I want my family back. It's gonna break Jonas' heart, but the wedding is off. Narrator: Coming up... So I had a great idea. Narrator: ...Drastic times call for drastic measures... Oh, my god, mother. Narrator: ...And Scarlett's party leads to all-out war. - I will slap you with it. - [ Bleep ]. Narrator: Nukkie's ex-husband, pookie, has returned to martinsburg, and nukkie has made a rash decision. It's gonna break Jonas' heart, but the wedding is off. I've got something to tell you. Are you okay? No, I'm pretty pissed. Nukkie left. Left just like that? Yeah, she wanted pookie. And is this for real? She does not deserve you. To walk around and act like that and just leave you to go with the ex-husband, boom, just like that -- - okay. - ...That's not right. It's all done. I don't want to talk about it. You don't want to talk about it? Leave me alone. Susan: I'm absolutely furious that this girl did this to him. He adores her. For her to just tear him apart like this, I'm furious, and now I never want to see her again, ever. Jonas: It made me cry for days. I cried for five days straight, and I don't cry over no girl, never have. I did her. This is serious. I really cannot believe nukkie. She's gone back in the same boat she was in. It don't -- I just can't make sense of it. Maybe one day when you grow up and get married, you stay married and marry the right man. Nukkie is the most selfish person that I can think of right now. This wedding has cost thousands of dollars. But you know what? It's not nukkie's wedding to cancel. Dallas, it's your mom. How are you? I'm good. You know, I've been thinking. I have put so much time and effort into this wedding, and I don't want to have to cancel it. So I had a great idea. Jay has been asking you over and over to marry him, so why don't you get married? Really? If you think we can get this done in this amount of short of time, and you think that it's capable of being the way I like things and my type of style, then we can do it. You better have this wedding being the best for me and looking the best. I'm excited. I really want to do this. Jay has been dying to marry Dallas, and now that Jay and Annie's divorce is final, there's nothing gonna stop them from getting married now. I'm excited to do this. It's gonna be a blast, and I can't wait. All right, well, love you. All right. Bye. Solves that problem. Narrator: Not only has Dallas inherited her sister nukkie's wedding, she's also inherited her dress, and with sondra flying in from Boston to deliver it, there's no time like the present to try it on. Sondra: I've never made Dallas a wedding dress before, but I've made one for nukkie. Nukkie likes crazy, funky colors. Does Dallas? I don't know. I'm a nervous wreck. I'm just so afraid she's gonna walk through that door and absolutely hate it. Hey! Hi! How are you? - I haven't seen you in a while. - I know. I have no idea what this dress looks like because my sister, she has a child's mind. I can't imagine you not loving it because it's gorgeous. - It's pretty. - It's gorgeous. It's not too big because, you know, I'm little, and I like everything small. All right. Well, let's go up and see it. It's like two dresses in one, so you'll see. Okay. Okay, take a deep breath. Hang on. Three, two, one. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Oh, oh. Wow, wow. Have I ever seen anything like this? I don't even know what to say. Why did my sister choose pink? - I'm sorry. - What is she thinking? Oh, wow. I hate pink. The wedding is right around the corner. I don't wear hot pink like that. I am not a Barbie. I am not a toy. What do I do with this dress? Oh, my god. Narrator: It's the day of 3-year-old Scarlett's birthday party, and she's being transformed into a gypsy Princess. All right, look at mommy. So today is the day of the party. I'm very excited. A lot to do, but it's gonna be great. All right, now look at me. You're gonna be my little gypsy Princess? All right, let's do it. Close your eye. That looks beautiful. Are you ready to put your dress on? You ready? Ooh. Turn around. Gorgeous. Narrator: Just down the street, mom Angie is making her own preparations for the party. - Is that gorgeous? - That is. - Let me see this. - That is beautiful. Narrator: And she's bought a traditional white gypsy dress for Scarlett to wear. And this is what hers is supposed to look like. That's the romany way. It is the romany way, and that's what she's gonna wear. Hopefully I spot Scarlett when I walk through that door, and I just take her by her little hand and run right into the bathroom -- - and you change her. - ...And I throw that dress on her, and I walk her right back out the door. Scarlett's gonna come out of that bathroom totally dressed different. She should. And that's the way I want to do it. Scarlett loves the bling. When she sees the dress, she's gonna want to take the other one off right there. Jett may not like it, but surprise, surprise, mama's stepping in. You ready, Scarlett? Narrator: Waiting to whisk her away to the party is Jett's fiancé, bubba. There's my girl. You ready to get on the horsey? The horse and carriage, you know, that's romanichal tradition. Horses go back in our culture for a long, long time, as far as people can remember. Being in a carriage is gonna make her day. Bubba: Here we go. You like it? Wait for me, guys. [ Horse whinnies ] So we pull up to this venue. It's amazing. It looks gorgeous. We've got a red carpet, and I'm just ready to party. Bubba: Come on. You ready? Holy jeez. [ Cheers and applause ] Whoa! Say hi! Happy birthday! Jett: Scarlett looks great. The party looks great. She's gonna have the best birthday party ever. You look so pretty. - Thank you. - It's crazy. Jett: My mom was there. She's looking at Scarlett's dress. She hates it, but we're gonna have fun. We're gonna turn this party out. All eyes are on Scarlett. We're having a blast. Everything turned out the way it should be. This is the best gypsy-Princess birthday ever. This is ridiculous. My granddaughter is wearing crazy colors. She should be wearing white and big. [Bleep], man. My daughter has lost her [bleep] mind. Somebody has got to step in, and that somebody's gonna be me. Narrator: Gypsy toddler Scarlett's third birthday party is in full swing, but her colorful dress, chosen by mom Jett, goes against grandma Angie's fiercely traditional ways, and she plans to do something about it. I'm like, "[Bleep], this dress is horrible looking." To be honest with you, I was complete dumbfounded, and it's really shaming me. - I need to talk to you. - Okay. Well, hold your -- hold on a minute. Get up and come on. I need to speak with you now. This is a bunch of [Bleep] to you. What have you done to this baby's party? Well, it's not your party, and it don't matter what you want and what you like. You look like a clown walking up in here. You look like a hypocrite. For one thing, you don't even look like a romany, like a romany should be dressed. You've put yourself in another religion somewhere. You know what? I'm down to earth. My granddaughter is not gonna look like that. I'm down to earth. Bye. I am not gonna have it. - Get the hell out of here. - That's under no circumstances. This is what she's going to have on. - She's gonna have that on. - No. That's my granddaughter's dress. Get off. - It's hers. - Do you know what? - She's not wearing this. - This is her party, and she deserves to be the romany that she is. She is not wearing this! She isn't wearing it. Sorry. Nope. Yep, rip it because she isn't wearing it. I will slap you with it. She's not wearing that dress. - I am not -- - she is not wearing -- she might not wear it now because you done tore it up, but I will get her one. I promise you [bleep] that. And you're [bleep]. [ Indistinct conversations ] That woman's crazy. Where is bubba? My mother looked like a complete clown, but she wanted to tell me how to dress Scarlett? No, Scarlett looks like a 3-year-old should look. She doesn't look like she needs to be put on a mermaid gown and look like a flipping clown. I'll have her another party my [bleep] self, and they will not be invited to it! I am [bleep] done! Get the [bleep] camera out of my [bleep] face now! * happy birthday to you * Jett: The drama's gone. It's out the door. I took care of her. She left. This party is gonna go on. * happy birthday to you * yay! One, two, three, blow them! Blow your candle. - Yay! - Whoo-hoo! Yay! This birthday party turned out amazing, except for the little incident with mom, but we took care of that, got her out of here. Scarlett loved it. I know she truly felt like a Princess. I wanted to give my miracle baby the best birthday party ever. Just seeing her excited, I knew I had done something right. - Whoo-hoo! - Yay! Whoo! Narrator: Gypsy bride-to-be Dallas is struggling to come to terms with having to wear her sister's hand-me-down wedding dress. My man's gonna laugh at me. He's gonna tell me I look like a little Dolly coming up in here. [ Speaks indistinctly ] ...His wife. Yeah. I can fix it to fit, but I can't change the color in 24 hours. It's beautiful. It's a beautiful dress. I just wish it was white. What are we gonna do? [ Sighs ] The skirt is removable. You'll have a mini for the rest of the day. So why don't you just try it on? Maybe you'll like it. Let's just see. What have you got to lose? If you don't like it, you don't like it, but at least you tried it on. Yeah, let's try it on. All right. Laurie, get pins. So this would all fit, you know, and we would make this fit like this. Give me the pins. Let's make this skirt fit. Okay. So what do you think? I think I'm in love with it now that it's on, honestly. I was a nervous wreck there for a while. I was, too. Ooh, I'm going to fall in it. I love it. I think it's gorgeous. I'm so glad you love it now. Sondra, how am I gonna twerk in this? This was a complete turnaround, unbelievable. She puts this dress on and she loves it. I mean, now that it's on me, it's, like, I don't even want to take it off. Last week, I did not plan to get married. I did not want to. But now that I see me in this dress, I'm bridal material, and I'm ready to walk down the aisle. It's a beautiful dress. Pack me up and send me away now to the altar. [ Laughs ] Narrator: Coming up... Ah! Narrator: ...Dallas' dream wedding turns into a nightmare. Your outfit doesn't go with that. I'm not allowed to be happy by nobody! I'm not allowed to be happy! Narrator: It's the day of Dallas and Jay's wedding, and the Stanley household is getting ready to celebrate. I'm excited to doll myself up and feel good for a day. I'm gonna worry only about myself and my kids and, you know, how happy I am, and enjoy myself. - Turn that down. - Mom, I am the bride. I need to get ready. All right, mom, move. Let me get done. I'll stick this right up you. Come on. Try me. Move, Demi. No. You're gonna break it, daughter. - Mom. - What? You know where that rue21 bag went? Dallas, I am not looking for a rue21 bag. It's got my makeup brushes I just bought. [ Bleep ] When you have a day to get a wedding ready, that's when your mind goes crazy. Ah! Once I get the straps on, we'll tighten you up, so don't worry. Sis, are you okay? Do you like it? Do you want it? Want to wear this? Whoo! It looks great. All right. We take a picture now. That looks really, really good. - Right? - That is absolutely amazing. You need to change your lipstick. No. I don't want no pink. Well, you need something else then, maybe something like this. I don't wear lip gloss. Your outfit doesn't go with that. I didn't pick the outfit out to go with me. The outfit has got to go with me. - I don't go with the outfit. - All right. Well, you have to go with the outfit right now, okay? It's not about what she wants. It was about what I want. She isn't gonna ruin this wedding for me. I haven't even yelled at you. I've let you get ready up there. You have been upstairs getting ready. Bridezilla all day! It's not bridezilla! I'm not allowed to be happy! I'm not by nobody! I'm not allowed to be happy! She's only tended to herself! - Dallas -- - no! You tell her to leave me alone, and y'all leave me alone! I'm going to kill somebody. I will, and I am. You need to leave. - No. - Goodnight. See you later. [ Crying ] Jay: [ Humming the "wedding march" ] [ Beatboxing ] When is mommy coming, Richie? When's mommy coming? I have no idea what's happening right now. I'm just waiting on Dallas to get here. I don't know what's taking her so long, and I started to drink. This is classic Dallas. She's never on time, never. Oh, I can't get in here. This skirt's too tight. [ Grunts ] [Bleep] My mother. [Bleep] This car. [Bleep] This cold weather. This is [bleep]. This is [bleep] [bleep]. I do not want to deal with this. Ben, I do not want that camera in my face, please. I need to drive, and I can not take that light. Ben: Okay. Let me -- I'm driving now, so turn it off. Ben: Let me just get a quick shot of you -- - no, please. - Okay, okay. Dallas: I'm driving myself to my own wedding. I don't need no one's help. It breaks my heart that my mom is gonna argue with me on my wedding day, you know? I'm trying to, you know, be happy for once. I'm a woman now. Now, respect me like one, and act like I'm a -- you know, I'm a person to you, like, I'm a daughter. Great, I forgot my train. Great. Now I've got to walk right straight into the wedding like this. [ Speaks indistinctly ] It's that time of the month. It's not that time of the month. Everybody just seems to screw up everything, that I'm trying to put right. Mm. I was so angry. I walked myself down the aisle just to show everyone I did not need no one by my side, and I did not want no one by my side. - You look good. - Thank you. So do you. Dallas: When I got to the altar, I just calmed myself down and said, "let's do this." Jay and Dallas, marriage is the promise between two people who wish to spend the rest of their lives together. Jay, please take Dallas' hand and repeat after me. - Dallas... - Dallas... - I take you as you are... - I take you as you are... I promise from this day forward... I promise from this day forward... To fill our life with adventure and our home with laughter. To fill our life with adventure and our love with -- or home with happiness, whatever he just said. Dallas, would you please repeat after me. - Jay, I take you as you are... - Jay, I take you as you are... Loving you who you are now and who you are yet to become. Loving you now and who are you are yet to become. Jay, do you take Dallas to be your wife? I do. Dallas, do you take Jay to be your husband? I do. And by the power vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may now share your first kiss as husband and wife. [ Cheers and applause ] Congratulations. Now let's get out of here, honey. Narrator: After seven years of twists and turns in their relationship, these two lovebirds are finally married... It feels good to be married to Dallas, and I wouldn't change a thing. I'm extremely happy. This may not have been the wedding that I planned, but seeing Jay at the altar made it my best day of my life. Narrator: And luckily for the wedding guests, bride and mom's tempers have cooled. Me and my mom have, like, a hate-love relationship. We could kill each other one minute and then love each other the next. We have a lot of ups and downs, but we also have the love that overcomes everything, and always got one another's back no matter what.
