A Coup D'Etat in Libanie. Prince Jean, cousin of King Carol, has seized power. The coup has triumphed. Carol has fled the country. Combat has ceased. The hospitals are full... Partisans shot. Many others have been imprisoned." "In the Prisons of Libanie." My mother is sick. Can't you take her to a hospital? There is no evidence against you. You are free to go. The inquiry concerning your wife isn't finished. She and her mother will remain. I've been freed. And you... Soon... They don't release you until you denounce others... Your husband has betrayed the cause! We're doomed. Your husband betrayed us. Why has he alone gone free? He's bought his liberty at the cost of ours... A year later, near Paris. Pierre Vignal, the engineer who just flew away,... is preparing our new commercial line. The plane had soon crossed the border. Across the horizon, a sea of clouds that must be crossed. The fierce wind stands opposed to the plane's advance. Now he must land, at any cost... But everywhere, forests... In the woods, a castle... A garden appeared to be the only point where one could land. When Vignal regained consciousness... "Are you suffering?" - The Countess Elizabeth Doctor Massaski You're at Styannik Castle, in Slovakia... Guest of the Countess Catchiez... That is, I. My brother-in-law. The doctor has ordered you to rest. As we're secluded, you must stay until you're healed. Vignal's not in danger. He'll be back soon. A month later, Pierre Vignal is recuperating. ...but he's in no hurry to leave the castle. Each day, the Countess calls on her guest. For a few days, I will be your only company. My brother-in-law has left on a trip. It's nothing... Just repairs... I'll tell them to work more quietly. I've dropped my cigarette. Excuse me... Soon, Pierre was capable of going on outings. Have you always been prisoner in this forest? Where could I go? I have no more family. My mother... Only my brother-in-law, by chance, was able to go free... Since then, I've been exiled to this castle... Alone, but for my brother-in-law and Dr. Massaski And your sister? My sister is dead. Our torturers killed her. Have you never thought of starting a new life? Who says I've never thought of it? Will you join me for checkers after dinner? My brother has returned and is asking for me. Excuse me... That evening. "Something urgent keeps me with my brother-in-law tonight. I can't see you until tomorrow. Forgive me for leaving you alone. - Elizabeth." "Something urgent keeps me with my brother-in-law tonight..." "To Nanthiez-Aviation: Paris by week's end. - Vignal" Are you the pilot who crashed beneath my window a month ago? Since your arrival, my sister and husband have hidden me. He is planning something wicked... I am Helene, Elisabeth's sister. Come back tomorrow night. Only you can save me... Don't abandon me... Aren't you bothered by all that noise? The pleas of Helene, whose existence has been denied... A mystery gleamed, Vignal decides to stay. Forgive me. Since my brother's return, I've left you lonely. No matter... I'll be leaving soon... So there's nothing to keep you here? Forgive me... but there's something I must ask you... Tonight... I'll come see you. "I'm in danger... I beg you to come at midnight to the place of our first encounter." After dinner. Tonight... I'll come see you. I was able to escape... You can't stay here... What if someone comes? They won't look for me here... If someone knocks, leave through that door. My husband and sister are spies... They're traitors to our King's cause... They fear me, for I know everything... My presence disturbs them... They want me dead... Only you can save me! Sir, I will give you an explanation tomorrow. For now, let me worry about my wife. We must escape... Tomorrow, we'll be both be killed! But your husband told me. They know I told you everything. They'll kill you... and me as well... If we make it to the village, we'll be safe. Go the inn at the nearby village. I'll meet you there and explain everything... Pick him up. We'll take him to the hospital in town. At the castle, some days later. Vignal, now healed, finally makes it to the village inn... "I'm saddened not to find you at this inn. I have so many things to tell you before we leave. I hope you receive this letter. Not knowing where you are, I'll leave it here just in case. - Doctor C. Stassaski." "My friend, The doctor carrying this letter will explain everything. We have left the castle to return to our home country, where duty calls. I will no longer think of you. - Goodbye, Elisabeth." A year has passed. Vignal has not seen the Countess... But he can't forget her... He tries to distract himself, in vain... Which of the two sisters was telling the truth? She who is dead? Or she who Pierre will always love? He was unable to keep his thoughts from his lost love. Finally one day, Pierre summons with a letter. Poor Helene suffered too much in prison. When she was released, she'd gone mad... We hoped to hide this sad situation. Alas, this very ignorance was the source of the drama. After her death, we left to start a revolt. Surely, you know of it's failure, and the fate of all who took part. I needed to know if, after so much misfortune,... my memory was still dear to you... The End
