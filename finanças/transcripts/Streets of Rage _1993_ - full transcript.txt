[ Artillery ] [ Helicopters ] [ Panting ] >> Look, I don't care what you have to do. Gag orders don't mean crap half the time. We'll have legal take care of it. Yeah. Yeah, I know. Yeah. Look, I'll call you back. Melody, you're late. >> I'm sorry, sir. >> What did you find out? >> Well, apparently Manila had a rap back east in '82. His lawyers got the records expunged after. >> Okay. Good. Okay, guys, look, see if you can find anything that's useful out of this stuff. But get me a story by 8:00 A.M. tomorrow. >> Uh, may I suggest, sir, that if I went along with them and were right on hand with my own research, perhaps it might tie things up quicker. >> Not a bad idea, Harrison. She's got moxie. >> I don't have a problem with it, sir. >> Manila's lawyer, line one. [ Clearing throat ] >> Yeah, Harrison. Yeah, Robert, listen. How's that coming? >> Going on with you, Nick? I mean, what, all of a sudden my calls don't get returned? I just need to know what's going on. Okay? >> Look, I just need a little time. >> Time? You've had two weeks. How much more time do you need? >> I don't know. Time, you know, time to find myself, gonna do a little soul searching, I guess... >> Wait, this is good. Let me run and get my violin. >> Hey, Max, you want to stay out of this, please? >> Max, he's your partner. Maybe you can tell me why I waste so much damn time with him. >> I don't know what's your excuse. Me, he was assigned to me by Harrison. >> That's right, Max. Look, you got better things to do with a deadline breathing down our necks than to stand around bullshitting about who's sleeping with who. >> That's whom, Mr. Harrison. But, seriously, sir, I really I feel I could help if I... >> Forget it, melody. Look, you've been research assistant for less than a year. If you want to be a reporter on my staff, you're gonna have to pay some serious dues first. >> Look, sweetie, I've been in this business most of my life. Hell, I was a copy boy for six frickin' years before I got my credentials. But nobody gave me a break, so I started digging up stories so good they had to print them. There's a story on every corner, but it's not gonna come to you. You gotta go find it. And with your brains and that big heart of yours, it's a cinch. >> Look, baby, I gotta run now. I'll call you tonight. Okay? >> A.M. means before I get in. And the answer's still no. And I want all of that fire commission stuff on my desk before I get in tomorrow morning, young lady. >> Yes, sir. [ Knocking on door ] >> Hi, there. Is Josie Wilson here? >> Maybe in there. >> Thanks. [ Overlapping arguments ] >> Don't touch me. I don't need shit from you, so why don't you stop fuckin' following me around. >> Look, you two, it's your turn to clean the place. Everyone has to do it. If you want to stay here, you've gotta play by the rules. >> Hey, nobody told me to stay here. Okay? I was put here, and I ain't gonna clean no shit hole. >> You expect US to scrub the toilet and the floors where those slob guys pissed all over? >> Excuse me. Uh, is this the Hudson house? >> Yes, it is. I expect you to clean where everybody pissed all over. But I got good news, girls. You don't have to use your hands. We've got gloves and brushes and mops. You know what a mop is. What can I do for you? >> Even when I was living in the street, wasn't nobody making me mop up shit. >> Yeah, in the streets, nobody made US mop up nothing. >> You're both right. And we can discuss the profound spiritual and philosophical ramifications of such an irony right after your chores are complete. >> That's telling them. Hi. I'm melody sails. I was wondering if I could take a couple interviews with the kids, uh, for an article I'm doing. >> Article? >> Yeah. >> For who? >> For the post. >> Sure. We can use a little exposure from the post. >> Um, it's an article I hope the post will print. >> Oh. >> Knock, knock. >> How can I help you, son? >> Think I could crash here a while? >> I'm afraid not. We're all filled up for the moment. But I'll be happy to get some information on your situation and put you on the list. >> List? What list? >> State welfare agency. That's where we get our funding. >> Look, I just need a place to crash for a few days. >> I'm sorry. That's the rules. And we're filled up past the limit anyway. >> Screw the rules. And screw you. >> Doesn't it just break your heart to send them away with nothing? >> Look, miss reporter, or whatever you are, we get hundreds of kids that walk in here wanting something every day, more than we can possibly handle. Do you give to every homeless person you run across? Of course not. You'll be broke. >> But he was so young? >> Well, we try to give them an option to sign up. I didn't tell him to go running off and. >> I'm not mopping up shit. >> That's it, you two. I'm sorry. I really got work to attend to, but you can come back next week if you like. >> Okay. Thank you. [ Overlapping dialogue ] >> Man, you got two seconds before I tear that little pretty boy face of yours off. >> I don't have any money. >> Leave him alone, guys. He doesn't have anything. >> You think we're stupid? >> Look, what'd you say, huh? [ Shouting ] >> Hey, hey, hey! Cool it, guys. Don't be picking on a young boy. What's your problem? >> What you want, lady? >> What are you gonna do about it, lady? >> What you gonna do about it? >> Come on. >> You're history now, bitch. >> Jesus, who are you, wonder woman? >> Get the hell out of here! Didn't I just see you at the Hudson house? >> Yeah? >> You okay? Why'd you run off like that? >> 'Cause they don't do nothing for anyone. >> That's not so, lady. He ought to try to sign up there. >> You know, I'm doing interviews about all this stuff. >> You're not a social worker, are you? >> No, just a wannabe reporter. >> I can do an interview, I guess, as long as you call me by a different name. >> That's no problem. No problem at all. >> Business is off today anyway, at least for me, that is. >> What are you looking at, lady? >> Oh, shit. He's watching. My butt's back to work. >> We're not so bad. >> So what do you say? >> How old are you? >> I'm as old as you Want me to be. >> You don't do that, do you? >> Hell, no, lady! >> So you sit around on your ass, giving my money to some street hobo kid. Flash, haven't I always looked after you, hmm? When I first met you, you had nothing. You were nothing. Now, look at you in your clothes, money in your pocket, supply of anything you need, and someone who loves you. I think you've got the world at your feet, don't you? >> Name's melody sails. >> Steven bur-- I mean, Steven Jones. >> Hi. >> I just panhandle for spare change, but a lot of other kids around here do all kinds of other stuff. >> Think I could take you to dinner tonight and hear all about it? >> You saved my life, lady. I'll buy you dinner. >> Where will you be at around eight o'clock? >> A pizza place, right down the street. >> Okay. I'll be there. And we'll argue about the check later. Okay? >> Okay. >> Talk to you later. >> Come on. You can't turn me down. >> I--i don't know. It might be a little too... >> What'll it take? Anything you want. >> Flash, you have to go out there and work harder than you have been. And I don't want to see you giving my money to some despicable little tramp too lazy to work for a living. Do you understand? >> Okay, lunar. But I don't think I can do this much longer. >> Oh, really? Don't you? >> No. >> Jesus, you look like you've seen a ghost. >> Come on with me. >> What's the matter, honey? >> Oh, my god. Jesus. Steven! >> We don't have half enough cops in this city to stop all the rapings, muggings, and murders that go on round the clock, let alone worry about following up on some little hooker's o.D., an o.D. That Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer probably don't give a damn about. >> So you don't even want a description of the kid? >> No. >> How the hell can you rule out foul play? >> I never rule out foul play. >> But this girl couldn't have been more than 16 years old. For chrissake, officer, what the hell is it gonna take for you to give a damn? >> Personally speaking, I do give a damn. Right now, I've got other things on my mind. Thank you, young lady. >> Don't you young lady me. My name is melody sails, and I'm a reporter from the post. You haven't heard the last of me yet. >> Where the hell do you get off calling the police commissioner and telling him how to do his job? And then claiming to be a reporter from the post? All these years of gates stonewalling, this paper finally gets a little rapport with the new police chief. And what do you do? You screw it all up. Where the hell is all that fire commission stuff? And I need it today. Christ almighty, does the word deadline mean anything to you? I'd fire you today if I didn't need that fire commission stuff. >> But, Mr. Harrison-- >> get out! >> So what'd he say? [ Sobs ] >> What do you care anyway, Nick? >> Well, I care about you. >> No, you don't. >> Yes, I do. >> No, you don't. >> Won't this be easier if I just put you on his shoulder? >> Shit, I gotta run... >> Nick, we need to talk. >> I'm busy till tonight. Okay? >> Dinner at my place tonight. >> All right. Sounds great. I'll try and make it. I'll call you. Okay? >> Oh, Max, what am I gonna do? >> About Nick or about Harrison? >> I don't know, just about everything. >> Well, Nick, I think it's time the both of you sat down and had a talk. Uh, Harrison, that all depends. >> Depends on what? >> Depends on how much this street kids article means to you. >> Max, I feel like I'm learning from the best. >> Oh, heh heh. >> What was that old story again, the one where you and Harrison snuck into the function and went under the limo just to hear what the chauffeurs had to say? [ Laughs ] >> You do what you gotta do. You just be careful. Okay? >> Okay. [ Phone rings ] >> Hello? >> Hi. Is Nick Houston working tonight? >> Hold on. No, I'm sorry. He's not here. >> Okay. Thanks. >> Okay. >> Melody, huh? [ Laughs ] >. Nick... >> Steven. >> Who's that? >> Oh, um, has anybody seen a kid named Steven around here, about 12 years old, curly blondish hair? >> Sorry, lady. >> I know who he is. Think you could spare some change so I could get something to eat? >> Sure. You get right down to it, don't you? >> You have to be that way if you want to survive. >> You think you could help me out first, though? >> What do you want me to do? >> Uh, I'm looking for Steven. I really need to talk to him. >> Are you his mother? >> Get out of here, girl. No. I'm doing interviews for a newspaper article. >> Wow. Well, will you interview me? >> Yeah. I'd love to. Any idea where we can find Steven first, though? >> Maybe. I mean, I know some of the places he hangs out in sometimes. >> Here, kid, go get yourself something to eat. >> That's okay. I just ate. Thanks. >> You ever think about getting a job or something? >> Oh, I don't know. I don't have an I.D. And I don't have an address to put down in case anyone wants to contact me. >> Tell you what. Your job now is to find Steven. I'll meet you here tomorrow night, same time. Okay? >> Okay. >> Smile. >> Oh, what the fuck? >> Took our picture. >> I know she took our god damn picture. Give me that camera, bitch. [ Gunshots ] >> I can kill her with my bare hands, sir. Why do you want me to scare her off? >> Oh, I don't know, gokor. She fascinates me, an enchanting tigress. I suppose we'll have to murder her or marry her. Quite a trophy either way. >> You look like you could use a cocktail. My word. Ever consider a 12-step program, honey? >> Oh, you mean a one-step program. >> I'm terribly sorry. >> You always get this excited in the presence of art? >> No. It's just that I had to rush through some terrible traffic to get here. >> Oh, I flew in here myself this evening. >> Oh. Um, if you'd excuse me... >> Hey, Kevin and Debra, gee, it's been a while since I've seen you guys. John pochna, this is my gallery. >> Oh. >> Don't be silly. John, how you been? Me and Debra, well, we don't get out too much since the baby. >> Guess this beats going home to an empty apartment with a burned chicken. >> Burned chicken? >> Debra writes poetry. >> Oh, going home to an apartment with burned chicken. That's very nice. Well, I'll see you later. >> Yeah, bye. Heh heh. Quite a joker, aren't you, Kevin? >> It's Scott, Scott toe. Though joker might be more appropriate this evening. May I enquire as to your name, my lovely lady? >> It's melody, melody sails. >> Sailing, sailing, over the ocean's main. [ Laughs ] >> I really should be going before I get any more buzzed. >> Oh, but how may I contact you, melody, now that we're acquainted? >> Aren't we getting a little familiar? >> Honestly? >> Yeah. >> Uh, I feel as though we met before. >> Is this Scott talking, or is this the joker? >> Does it matter? >> I honestly don't know anymore. >> What does that mean? >> Here. That's my work number. You figure it out. >> Hi, honey. It's Nick. Sorry I couldn't show up for dinner tonight. I got wrapped up in this assignment. Time just seemed to slip by. You know how it is. Always have to be on top of that story. Take a rain check on dinner and, uh, dessert. I'll see you in the morning. Love you. So Tuesday night dinner's on me. >> No. Forget it, Nick. >> Come on, honey. You know as well as I do how this business is. >> They call this a business? You, young lady, call the police. >> Okay. >> So what do you say, Tuesday night, sweetheart? Hey, why should she call the police? >> Well, it's regarding this story I'm writing. >> You're writing a story? >> That's right, Nick. I mean, you don't care what's going on in my life anyway, just as long as I'm there when you whistle, right? >> Look, I know I've been a self-centered asshole. >> That's right. >> What can I say? I'm sorry. But I do care about you. Listen, I'm not ready to lose you yet. >> Phone, Mel. >> Uh, take a message. >> It's not over between US. >> Nick. >> Name's Scott talbert. >> Did he leave a number? >> No. He said he'd call back. >> Oh, shit. >> Who was that? >> Wouldn't you like to know? >> Yeah. As a matter of fact, I would like to know. >> Well, me and my cousin Emmanuel were driving on the 405, and this cop pulls US over. And he tries to make US get out of the car. So my cousin Emmanuel pulls his gun out, and he shoots his ass. The reason why I'm here and not in juvi is 'cause they let me off easy. The rap was pretty heavy. They were gonna try to charge me with manslaughter. But then they took it easy on me, so now I have to stay here till I turn 18. >> Bet your mom's hurting from all this, isn't she? >> My mom is dead. >> I'm sorry. >> Okay. She died from aids. Guess the drugs get to you after a while. >> How was your relationship with your parents? I mean, how was your home life? >> I didn't have no parents. I didn't have shit. Just me and my mom, if you can call her that. She would go out, pick up guys and bring them home. They would hang out for a few days and get fucked up. Then she would pass out, and they'd come into my room and try to make me do things I didn't want to do. >> I mean, I wouldn't say my life was, like, perfect, but, I mean, I wouldn't say it was too bad either. I mean, it's just it was awful. I just had to get out of there. >> Why did you run away? >> I didn't get the good treatment from my mom. I didn't get the good treatment from my step-dad. I mean, everything was just all piled into one. >> Okay. >> That alley is a notorious shooting gallery. Now, what did you expect junkies and drug dealers to do when you took their picture? >> Smile? >> Very funny. You should know better than to go wandering off alone in the dangerous neighborhoods. >> Look, I was doing an investigative story. >> The only story was the one you told about being a reporter. >> I know. I'm really sorry about that one. It's just that these street kids are so torn and abused. It just breaks my heart that more can't be done. And this is my only way I can help them out. >> Or is it the only way you can get your press credentials maybe? >> Look, that one was below the belt. >> But I'm trying to impress upon you how dangerous this whole thing is, dangerous not only to you but to the police officers who might have to save your naive skin one dark night. You're lucky, miss sails. Whoever took that shot at you was trying to warn you off rather than kill you. >> Yeah, I know. I can tell. >> Right. What do they teach you that in the girl scouts? >> No. I've had some military experience. >> Yeah, well, so have I. >> Special forces commando, prisoner retrieval unit, three purple hearts, five valors. >> RotC, claremont college. [ Laughs ] I guess I made a jackass out of myself over that one. >> Uh, that's okay, officer. I mean, it was me who made a jackass out of myself the other night. I really want to apologize for that. And I do appreciate you skipping your lunch break and taking my report here. >> No problem. Well, my name's Ryan. >> Officer Ryan, call me Mel. >> Mel. >> Hey, wonder woman. >> Looks like I did good first day on the job. >> How you doing, guys? Little hungry? >> I am. I must have had five candy bars today, and that's all I could afford. >> Oh, Jesus. Here. >> What did you say your name was again? >> Melody. >> Melody, why you so nice to US? >> Because I like you, and I very much want to be your friend. >> Well, will you be a real friend and let me stay at your place tonight? I could sleep on the floor. >> You want to stay at my house tonight? >> Could I stay, too? >> I don't know. I have to think about that one for a minute. >> We promise not to be a bother. It's just that it gets cold late at night after the hangouts close down. And it would be really great to sleep indoors for just one night. >> I don't even need a blanket, just a warm floor. >> Don't be silly. Of course I have space. Just for one night, right? >> Sure. >> Yeah. >> Okay. >> Cool. >> Hey, great place. >> Oh, hey, it's okay. I'm not touching anything. >> You can touch. Just don't break, dear. Um, candy, that couch there makes out into a bed, and a sleeping bag for you, young man. You guys can deal with that? >> Yeah. >> Is it okay if I have a drink? >> Yeah, the kitchen's right in there. Help yourself. >> Great. >> Sandwich okay? >> Okay. >> Here. Honey, it's getting late. You think we could do the interview in the morning. >> It's okay. We can do it now. I gotta get on the street early before lunar's girls. >> Okay then. Let's go over to the kitchen. So, uh, tell me. Who's lunar? >> So, uh, you make a lot of money on this job? >> You kidding? I'm lucky if I can pay my rent. Back to this lunar character, who is he? >> Flash's creep boyfriend. >> She thought. He had this smooth line, took her out to eat, bought her some terrific stuff. She was crazy about him. But you hear it from the other girls, you know. They all got the smooth talk, and they all ended up turning tricks on the street. >> How old are you, candy? Where you from and what brought you out to the coast? >> I'm just going on 19. >> Try 16 going on 19. >> I'm 12, going on 19. >> Twelve. God, what are you guys doing out in the streets? >> Well, I lived with my mom back in a small town in Texas. But she was out of work, drinking all the time. I mean, I was the one taking care of my brother. Then one day, we wake up, and she's gone. We get thrown into a foster home. He's in one. I'm in the other. I mean, I can't even find out where he is. What was I supposed to do? I hated it in that place. And so I hitched a ride out here. Flash wanted to take me to live at lunar's, but I didn't like what was happening to her. And I gotta be free, okay? So the streets are where I live. I never met lunar. He's got his eyes on those girls. I feel him staring at the back of my neck sometimes, makes my skin crawl. >> Well, it's late. Why don't we finish the interview in the morning? >> Okay. >> Hi, honey. It's Nicholas. I just want to say I really miss you. I'll come over and spend the night if you want. All you have to do is whistle. >> Ooh, baby. Heh heh heh. >> Melody, Scott talbert here. I got your number from work, and I hope I'm not being too forward. But I've been thinking about you and really love to see you again. I'll be settled in by tomorrow, and I'll give you a call then. >> Uh, number two. >> Ooh. >> Melody, this is Ryan mccain calling on totally unofficial business. I know you may think this is off the wall, but would you like to have lunch with me tomorrow? We could take a little picnic to Bronson park maybe. Give me a buzz in the morning. Bye. >> Damn, woman. What's your secret? >> I swear to you, my horoscope totally must have changed today. >> I know mine did. Hey, uh, which guy do you like best? >> You. Now go to sleep. Good night, guys. >> Are those the men that did it? Gokor, would you be so kind as to have a polite word with those two gentlemen regarding their recent lack of manners with my darling Billie? >> I will have a word with them, sir. >> Sweet baby doll, did they hurt you? There, there, darling sweetheart. Does baby need to feel better? >> What's up, man? What do you want? >> What's going on, man? >> Hey, what's that all about, man? >> I'm taking my little baby home to lunar's house to be my favorite sweetheart. Would you like that, darling, mm? >> Yeah, lunar. I'd like that. >> Gokor, can't you see that they're still moving? Now, go back there and cripple those heathen bastards so that they never walk again. >> Yes, sir. >> And he cooks, too. >> Hi-ya! [ Clearing throat ] >> Good morning. >> I wish I knew how you did it. >> Hey, where'd candy go? >> She left a note. She said thanks and you're real nice and stuff. You know, I think so, too. >> Thanks. So-- oh, my goodness. What happened to you? >> Oh, it's okay. It's nothing. >> Yeah, some big nothing. >> That was aunt Rosie. She was pretty big on discipline. >> What'd she do it with, a razor strap or something? >> Hey, you don't want to know. >> You bet I want to know. A lot of people want to know. They want to know what drives you kids to the streets. >> I didn't get driven. I ran. My folks are high most of the time or out trying to find the money to get a fix. My aunt really took care of me. You know, I was a smart mouth. I guess I still I am. And her arm wasn't strong enough, so she found something stronger. Look it, if you write this story and they find out how old I am, they'll send me back. >> They'd never do that. >> Lady, you don't know nothing. Anyhow, I was crazy about Clint Eastwood, you know. I figured I'd meet him or something. He'd let me work around the house. That guy is so cool. No one puts that man down, never. >> You know what? I'd never print anything that would get you into any kind of trouble. Tell me what you know about flash. >> What I know, you don't want to know. We both want to keep on breathing, right? >> You know what happened to her, don't you? >> She was so nice. She always gave me a couple bucks for dinner. But I saw this guy's car in the alley before I found flash. He's always around. Like, seems like everyone works for him. He's got them hypnotized or something. You know, I wish I could fight like you. Then no one would put anything over on me. >> I mean, what does he have on everybody? Is he some sort of drug dealer or something? What does he look like? >> He's always in the car, like, never gets out. He's got all these people around him do his dirty work. >> So nobody has ever seen him? He's just a voice? >> And he talks kind of funny. >> What do you mean? >> You know, la Dee da. He's got an accent. >> What kind of accent? >> I don't know, English, I guess. Look, I'm telling you, just stay away from this creep. >> You're scared, Steven. >> I don't know. I think he might have killed flash. >> Then let's go to the police. >> No way! Are you crazy? They'd have me back to aunt Rosie's in a minute. Or lunar will find out. Look, I got business to do, so you think I could stay over at your house again tonight? I'll do anything. I'll fix my own breakfast. I'll fix you breakfast, anything. >> Eight o'clock. You got a deal. [ Telephone rings ] >> Line one, Mr. Harrison. Will you take the call? >> Yeah, Harrison. Right. >> Will you excuse US for a minute? >> Yeah, John, uh, listen... >> Listen, about that night. >> You didn't even call. >> Yeah, I did call. >> Yeah, after midnight. >> I know. Listen, I get so overwhelmed in my work sometimes. You know, I was all the way across town on an assignment. And I didn't get back until well after midnight. >> Not a good enough excuse, Nick. >> Look, Mel, um, I've been going through some personal dilemmas the last few weeks. You know, but I'm starting to get things worked out. >> Yeah, who is she? >> Hey, you know how I feel about you. >> I know. I just can't go through that rollercoaster you're putting me through anymore. >> Well, why don't you cook me a chicken tonight and I'll bring over a bottle of dom perignon? >> That's not fair, Nick. >> Can't resist a good bottle of champagne, huh? I bet that's not all you can't resist. >> That guy talbert again, Mel. Want me to take a message? >> No. I'll take it. Hi, Scott. Uh, no, I seem to be a little bit tied up for dinner tonight. Oh, you know, just an old friend. Yeah. I'll tell you what. I'd love to have drinks with you before dinner. Oh, I know this great little cafe on sixth and la brea. You know it? Sounds good. I'll see you at 7:00. >> Harrison's off the phone. >> Bye. >> Tell you what. You be in front of your apartment at eight o'clock sharp. All right? Or it's finished between US. Okay? >> Finished between you? >> Did I miss anything good? >> Shut up, Max. >> Ow. >> Now, where's the rest of that stuff on the ex-fire commissioners? >> It's right here, sir. >> Oh. Oh, very good. I'm glad I didn't fire you the other day. >> A detective mccain on the phone for melody. >> Tell him I've already talked to his chief. Everything's okay. Not to worry. She's not gonna bother him anymore. >> No, you don't understand, sir. >> What don't I understand? >> Says it's his only day off, melody, and he spent all morning fixing lunch for a picnic. >> Dinner's off. >> The plot thickens. >> So my compliments to the chef. >> Thanks. I'm told I have a way with tuna fish sandwiches. So, melody, you're telling me this kid saw something? >> No. I'm telling you a 12-year-old boy might know something about a murder. A hooker's killed because she wants to leave the streets, and a creep named lunar may have done it. >> So did this kid see it? I mean, could he identify this lunar guy? >> No, he'd never do that. He's a runaway from a really abusive home, so he's probably better off on the streets. The authorities get a hold of him, they're just gonna send him right back home. >> You want to talk about authorities. The judge is gonna book you for contempt of court you withhold this kind of evidence. >> I'll tell you what. You don't seem like the kind of guy that would pull that over me. [ Chuckles ] >> All right. Let's get back to the kid. Now, he saw it or he thinks he saw it? What is it? >> Oh, well, he knows the car. And he may have seen a body dump from the car. >> But I'm not gonna know who this kid is, right? >> I have my journalistic ethics to uphold. >> And I have the god damn law to uphold. >> So what's next? >> This. >> Ryan. >> Sorry. Don't know what I was thinking. >> That's okay. You just kind of caught me by surprise. >> Did, um, did I blow it? >> No. It's just that I'm sort of maybe in the last stages of a yearlong relationship. >> Are you dating anyone yet? >> No, not really. >> Are you withholding evidence from me? >> No. It's just that I'm going out to drinks tonight with some guy I met at some wacky art opening. That's about it. >> Some underground hippy type? >> Texas oil millionaire. >> Ouch. Hard to compete on a cop's salary. >> I wouldn't count myself out so fast. >> I didn't. >> You know, you're kind of a hard guy to figure out, Ryan mccain. Ryan. >> God damn it. Oh, melody, melody, melody. >> Oh, Scott, you shouldn't have. Oh. >> Gorgeous. I bet he's quite a charmer. >> Two white wines, if that's all right with this lovely lady. >> That's okay. They are really beautiful. >> And so are you, melody. So are you. >> Well, I just don't know quite what to say. >> These are on me. >> Gee, thanks. You seem to do all the right things. Why don't you tell me something about yourself, Mr. Talbert? >> I will, over dinner tonight. >> I don't know. You've kind of popped into the scene in a pretty crazy week for me. >> Crazy from all the newspaper work or crazy from all the men who'd like to be in your life? >> And wouldn't you like to know? >> So how's your story coming along? >> Okay, Mr. Psychic. How do you know so much about me? >> Well, you work at the post. It doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to figure out you're a reporter. >> Mm-hmm. You're wrong about that one. >> Not a reporter. >> No, but I plan to be very, very soon. >> How's that? >> Well, I'm doing my first real story. And it kind of started out with some few simple interviews with some street kids. Now I'm on to something much, much bigger. You wouldn't believe me if I told you. >> Sounds fascinating. >> And very exhausting. I'm just a research assistant by day. >> Brenda starr by night. >> Which reminds me, I can't stay too much longer. >> What about dinner tonight? >> I'm gonna have to take a rain check on that one. >> Tomorrow night then, mm? >> I don't know. >> Now, hold on here. I won't take no for an answer. >> Uh, well, I guess if it's an early evening. I really do have to work on my story after dinner. >> To your story. >> To my story. >> Melody, listen, I have to tell you, I'm not sorry at all. Actually, I'm not sorry at all that I did what I did. Actually, I'm sorry what I did. I apologize for-- god. Melody, you're really blowing it, babe. You should be here right now with me. And instead you're out doing something you shouldn't be doing, and here I am sitting here waiting like a total schmuck. Shit! I'm sorry. >> So I guess i--oh, hey, Nick. >> Hey, thought we had a date tonight. >> Well, last I heard, it was called off. >> I didn't-- no, I really didn't mean-- >> which one is this one? >> Oh, Nick, this is candy and Steven. >> Hi. I'm melody's new boyfriend. >> Is he the cutest? Or are the others cuter? >> Um, I didn't really expect a party tonight. Well, I don't really know what to expect from you nowadays, melody. >> Well, that's right, Nicholas. Maybe you should start getting used to that. >> What's that supposed to mean? >> I believe she is inferring that your status as the one and only man in her life is undergoing, or perhaps has already undergone, a serious reevaluation. >> Can I date him if you guys are broken up? >> Listen, can you tell your little friends to run along so we can sit down and talk? >> Will everybody please come inside? >> Oh, shit. >> Here we are. >> Mm-mmm. >> You know, it's a little, um, it's a little difficult to talk in here. >> Candy and I did our research today, but, uh, you think we can talk around this guy? >> I don't know. >> All right. That's it. I'm outta here. Little shit. >> Oh, did I blow it? [ Door closing ] >> No. That's okay, honey. Seems like my life needs a little shake out right now, and gonna let the chips fall as they may. [ Shouting ] >> Can I get you anything else, sir? >> Mm, yes. My telephone, sweetheart, and a glass of chocolate milk for Billie here. I'm very proud of you, Billie darling, sweet little Billie. You've made a wonderful recovery, and wonderful contributions to the family funds this month, unlike that little bitch, flash. Thank you, sweetheart. Billie's going back to work tomorrow now that she's rested from her nasty little incident. >> Dinner was really great, melody. You're really cool for letting US hang out here. >> I hadn't had dinner like that in a long time. >> You're welcome. [ Phone rings ] >> You want me to get it? >> No. I'm exhausted. Let the machine pick it up. >> Okay. >> Hi. This is melody sails. Leave a message for me. Thanks. >> Melody, Scott here. I just wanted to say how lovely you were this evening. I do look forward to our dinner tomorrow. I'll be thinking of you 'til then. >> Wow. Is that the flower guy? >> That's him. >> So who's the lucky guy, uh, me, ahem, flower guy, or the cop? I already scratched Nick off the list. >> I don't know at this moment, you little rascal. A 12-year-old boy, beaten in body but not in spirit, runs to Hollywood seeking an impossible dream, only to find himself living on the streets, mean, inhospitable streets. A 15-year-old girl befriends him, gives him money for food when her jealous pimp isn't looking, not just any pimp but a slick, English-accented, chauffeured, Mercedes-riding man who the frightened street kids refer to as lunar. Very few actually get to see his face, but lunar's presence is felt nonetheless. He lords over his territory, gets kids hooked on heroin, prostituting their bodies to feed their expensive habits and lunar's expensive tastes. Escaping lunar isn't just difficult. It can be fatal as flash found out. Her semi-clad body was found in a dark Hollywood alley late Tuesday night, some say as a warning to others, a warning not to cross lunar's brutal path. >> Pretty good, Harrison. >> Yeah. Yeah, I really like this, melody. Why didn't you tell me you had reporter's blood in your veins? >> Well... >> But you're gonna have to dig a little deeper. Now, we're gonna have to substantiate most of this stuff before we can print it. >> Yeah, I'm working on it, sir. >> And you really think she's on to something? >> Oh, apparently so. She's opened up a line of communication with these kids that the cops never had. >> You don't say. Okay, melody. If this turns into anything, you can start calling yourself a reporter. >> Oh, thank you, Mr. Harrison. >> Go on. Get out of here. And, uh, thank you for coming by, detective. >> No problem. >> It was very kind of you to come along, Ryan. I really appreciate it. >> Don't worry about it. And if you're right about this lunar guy, you really help US crack the case in this neighborhood. >> I hope so. Well, hi, Nick. Uh, Nick, this is detective Ryan mccain. Ryan mccain, this is Nick mead. >> Glad to meet you. >> Nice to meet you. >> Mead! >> And although this has absolutely no bearing on our professional relationship, it'd be nice to see you on a more personal basis. >> Mead! >> All right already. >> Seem to be very uncommitted at the moment. >> Good. Then how about dinner tonight? >> Oh, god, I'd really love to, but I already have dinner plans. >> The competition. >> You know how late we are on this Manila story? You should have had a dozen interviews by now, and all I've got to work with is a rehash from last week's rehash. >> He's hard to pin down, sir. >> Pin down. The only thing you've been pinning down around here is half the secretarial staff. >> Wait, wait... >> Max, keep an eye on melody. She's digging into some dangerous stuff here, probably more dangerous than she realizes. Look, you know these girls. They get a b.A. From vassar. They think it gives them an automatic degree in street smarts. >> Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on her. >> She's more dangerous than she appears, sir. >> Yeah, you ought to know, Romeo. >> Damn, lady, who you gonna kill tonight? >> Some bozo from Texas who's crashing at his rich aunt's house who wants to get laid before she comes back. >> You are such a little dog. >> Ruff. >> Hey, does that Texas guy have any cute friends? >> Steven has quite a sense of humor. >> We've met. >> Look, I told you they don't want me to stay here. >> It's all right, dear, for a few nights at least. >> Well, okay. But I'm not signing any papers for the welfare people or anything. >> Don't worry. Your friend and I know someone in the police department. I'm letting you stay here unofficially as a favor to him. >> Oh, picnic cop. I get it now. >> The hell is a picnic cop? >> They're cops that patrol picnic areas and makes sure that everybody puts their litter in the proper recycling cans. >> Really? >> Yeah. >> Melody's got quite a sense of humor. >> Stupid girl, stupid picnic cop. >> Well, it's good for the recycling and the earth and ecology. [ Laughs ] [ Doorbell rings ] >> Hi. I'm melody sails here to see Mr. Talbert. >> Mr. Talbert will be with you in just a moment. >> Thank you. >> May I have the pleasure to bring you a glass of champagne perhaps? >> Actually, that would be quite nice. >> Some Henri reserve '68 Rose perhaps. >> Oh, yeah, that'll be fine. $2000 a bottle, you're damn right that'll be fine. >> Here you are, miss sails. >> Thank you. >> And that, my dear, is definitely what the wine connoisseurs refer to as the good stuff. Voila. My belle, my lady melody. >> Hi, Scott. Mmm. >> Mmm. Nectar of the gods. >> Yeah. >> To the goddess. >> To the joker. >> Are you sure you're for real, melody, not another joker spinning wild tales of murder and intrigue? >> You never know. I mean, these kids have really confided a lot in my interviews. And just a few more ends tied together, and my story gets published. And that crummy drug lord is history. >> Well, let's hope the blackguard is not an illusion, and you'll win a pulitzer prize. >> Pulitzer, that word kind of makes me warm and tingly inside. [ Laughs ] >> Pulitzer. Pulitzer. [ Laughs ] >> Pulitzer. Pulitzer. Pulitzer. Pulitzer. [ Laughs ] >> Mmm. >> Mmm. >> Are you trying to get me drunk? >> Mm-hmm. Well, have I? >> Yes. >> '45 lafite rothschild. Melody, you all know what winks and makes love like a tiger? >> No. Oh, Scott. What am I going to do with you? >> Oh, just relax and be admired. >> I don't think I'm ready to move that fast. >> Come on, melody. Let yourself go. >> Excuse me, sir. Your presence is requested. >> Oh, will y'all excuse me, melody? Edward here will show you to the den, and I'll join you there in a sec. >> Saved by the bell or into the frying pan. >> I beg your pardon? >> Oh, never mind me. I'm drunk. Or haven't you noticed after that third bottle you poured? >> Perhaps some coffee. >> No thanks. Everything's just perfect, just so perfect. >> What do you want me to do? >> Stay out of sight a while longer, at least until the bedroom lights are turned off. Poor dear is starved of love and physical attention. Oh, well, back to work. The goddess beckons for lunar. Melody? Are you sleeping, melody? Are you asleep, my darling? My little kitten, my little dove, my sweet little pussy cat. I'll take care of you tonight, darling. Edward is preparing our boudoir with 50 candles. You'll like that, my love. You're so-- your flesh yearning, yearning to be taken by the moon. Taken by your moon god perfect god incarnate, by lunar. >> Oh, my goodness. I must have had too much to drink. >> Don't worry, melody. I'll help you upstairs into something more comfortable. >> I really should be going. >> Oh, melody, you can't drive like this. You must stay here tonight. >> That sounds nice, but I have to be at work at 6:00 A.M. >> Shh. You must stay here tonight. >> Darling, don't rush a good thing. Tonight was magic. Something's opened up inside of me that makes me feel really wonderful. So if you mean what you say, you can wait for the weekend. >> Women. As much as we learn about you, the more your mysteries continue to confound US. [ Vomits ] >> Yum, yum. >> Do I know you? >> No. I'm sure that you heard all about me. >> Lunar? >> Mm-hmm. It's about time you accepted my invitation, candy. >> Look, please, let me out of here. >> Do you like giving interviews, candy? I'm sure that you do. I've heard that you like giving them about me. Now, I know that you're a busy girl, but would you like me to interview you, hmm? >> Look, please, I swear. I didn't say anything. I swear I didn't. >> Oh, thank you. Drive on, gokor. >> All right. I'm totally hung over. My soul has been violated, and my god damn feet hurt! So whoever the fuck is in there, you're really gonna get your ass kicked now. And next time you want to work out, make an appointment. [ Retches ] >> Are you sitting comfortably? Then I'll begin. Oh, I love texture of very young skin. It makes my fingertips tingle. Oh, I can see that great big heart of yours starting to pound against your oh so white, tender, young bosom. >> What do you want from me? >> What do you want from me? What I want, darling, is a little comfort and satisfaction, the comfort and satisfaction that your friend denied me. >> You mean flash? I hardly knew her. >> No, I don't mean that despicable little bitch whore, flash. I mean your dear, charming, new friend, melody. >> What does that have to do with me? >> Can you bark like a dog? Oh, what am I saying? Of course you can. >> Oh, please... Please... >> Tonight, you shall have the honor of giving your god, lunar, his satisfaction. Lunar, the moon god, should open your senses, exquisite. Oh, I'm not being a gentleman. Look how tense you are. Perhaps I should give you a back rub first. >> Ooh. >> Babykins, it's Nick-- >> I heard what happened to you last night. And it says that we're on to something. >> And I'm gonna keep a better watch on you, too, babe. We've got a big fish on the line now. >> Now I don't want you getting hurt either, sweetheart, story or no story. >> That's right. >> Well, now that I found lunar, you think you could help me out with some heavy-duty research tonight, Max? >> Aha. Now you're the reporter, and I'm the research assistant. Role reversal, I told you, Harrison. >> No. Honestly, Max, I really need your help. >> Seriously, I'm joking. Of course I'll help you, melody. >> Thanks. >> Oh, melody, and the way you infiltrated lunar's place, that was brilliant. I mean, pretending to be a dinner date pickup, ha ha ha, I love it. >> Yeah. I need to see Steven. Come on. Nobody knows where Steven's at? >> Apparently not. >> For chrissake. He was supposed to stay indoors after dark. I thought that was understood. >> This is a halfway house, not a prison. And we were only doing y'all a favor to begin with. Man. >> Look, I'm sorry. I mean, it's been a really tough week for me. My apartment was broken in last night, and the same people who did it might be looking for Steven. >> He went to get some pizza. >> Damn it, girl. Why didn't you say so? >> Shit, I ain't no snitch. >> Don't look at me. >> You should have dumped her a long time ago. What are you talking about, waiting this long for it? >> Excuse me. Has anybody seen a kid named Steven, about 12 years old, curly blondish hair, about this tall? >> Oh, yeah. The little twerp just left. God, but what's it worth to you to know where he went? >> Well, I just-- >> a blowjob? [ Laughs ] >> I should break your god damn neck. Now, where is he? >> He went to get his stuff where he crashes behind the laundromat. >> You little shit head. Hi, Steven. >> Hey, Mel. Didn't expect to see you here. This is my old sleeping place. >> Honey, the streets aren't safe for you anymore. >> Just a moment. I'll be through. So taking me home again tonight? >> Most definitely. >> Yes. >> Kid, come here, kid. >> Give US the kid. [ Shouting ] [ Shouting ] >> Come on. Let's go. Come on. >> It's all my fault. I never should have brought him into this. >> Well, prepare yourself for more bad news. >> Oh, my god. Don't tell me Steven. >> Candy. >> Shit. >> Her real name was Carol wolinski, drug overdose. We found her body this afternoon. We didn't make a positive ID until an hour ago. >> It had to have been lunar's work. I know it. The girl was not into drugs. >> Not so. Two priors, both drug related. >> It had to have been him. What about Steven? >> He had already disappeared and was listed as missing before he was kidnapped. I'll do what I can, Mel. It's gonna be next to impossible to get a search warrant without any tangible proof linking lunar to any of this. >> Ryan, you're not gonna stick to regulations on this, and let a 12-year-old boy die? >> Look, I'm a cop, Mel. If we don't uphold the law, we're no better off than lunar and his gang. >> Damn it. Where do you stand on this one? I'm just gonna have to take him out myself. >> Look, for chrissakes, Mel, you do that, you'll be the one behind bars, not lunar. Shit. Look, if you had just confided in me, Steven might not be in this mess. >> Oh, great. >> Look... I'm sorry. I'll do what I can. Okay? >> So help me god, I'll do what I can. >> You really haven't much of a sense of self-worth, have you? You despicable little shit. Yeah, but for once in your life, your miserable, lazy, little hide is actually worth something, the value of a poker chip, a poker chip in tonight's game of life. [ Speaking foreign language ] >> Thirty years ago, when I did this, they spoke English. [ Rattling ] >> Hi, uh, I'm the transmission inspector from the automobile club. >> Oh, Max. Shit. >> Well, have you ever had a woman, mm? Would you like one before you die? I have all the women I like, you know. And do you know why? Because I love them, and I hate them, love them, hate them. They quite like that, you know, gets their juices flowing. But you wouldn't understand that, would you, you sweet little virgin boy, you? You despicable little shit. [ Chuckles ] >> We found him snooping around, trying to spy on US. >> Is that true, dear fellow? >> Come on. Let the kid and me go. Don't make things worse for yourself. >> Worse for myself? Well, you, dear boy, seem to be the one who's in a bit of a pickle. >> What? You think you can put yourself above everything else just because you have a little power? >> Power is an attribute of god himself. And earthly power dost then show likest god's. >> You can spout Shakespeare all you want, pal, but the pen is still mightier than the sword. >> Richelieu, act two, very good. Take these two and throw them in some closet while I finish my game in peace. Damn fellow, trespassing, the nerve of him. I think a little of Napoleon's finest is quite in order. [ Speaking foreign language ] [ Shouting ] >> Melody, what are you doing here? >> Cut the crap, you son of a bitch, and tell me where they are. >> Why, who could you possibly be referring to? >> You have got two seconds to tell me where they are before I turn your face into hamburger meat, buddy. >> What is this, melody, foreplay? You really are quite a tease. Though I must confess, masochism is really not my cup of tea although I do like to see it in a woman as lunar thrusts into her pleading flesh. >> You don't seem to understand. I'm finished playing with you now. >> But I am not finished playing with you, my dear. Bloody her up. Make her hot for me. Gokor, get up! Dear melody, I'm very impressed. With gokor as my right arm for so long, I don't know if I remember how to use a gun. Like to see if I remember. Definitely not one of your better moves in the chess game of life. Checkmate. >> You bastard. [ Shouting ] >> Hi, Mel. Good thing I came along to keep you out of trouble. >> You guys okay? >> No. We've been listening to this stupid idiot's speeches all evening. >> I resent that. You'll regret that by the time this evening's over. >> Just let them go. I'll do anything you want. >> Oh, I shall have anything I want, darling. And I won't have to barter for it. >> You'll have to kill me first. >> Oh, really? Very well. Kneel! We're going to play a game called melody's choice. One of them lives, and one of them dies. One lives. One dies. One lives. Which one? Just like a woman. Can't make up your bloody mind. Well, I'll have to make it up for you. >> I'm begging you, for god's sake, don't. >> One lives. One dies. One lives. One dies! >> Freeze! You drop them. >> Thank god, Ryan. >> Guess I learned something at RotC. Lunar, if you're still alive, you're under arrest. >> Shit, Mel. I'm dying, Ryan. >> Oh, is this a good story. >> I told you you were going to go down in history with the rest of the scum. Now you can consider me a reporter now, right? >> Can I do your research? >> Is this the, uh, Texas millionaire, the competition?
