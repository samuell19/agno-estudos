You're serious! What about Hokkaido? Hokkaido... You kept bugging me about going someplace where there's snow, and I want to go back home, so I promised to show you around if you drove me. Take the last flight north. I remember that much clearly. Don't tell me you don't remember, 'cause I'm totally into it. You've got the wrong idea. What's with you? You're the worst when you're sober. But a completely adorable drunk. You shouldn't take advantage of inebriation. What! Get lost! I really don't get it... I'm so embarrassed by what you did,. 1 can't even open the store. Your mother's first memorial service is coming up, but you'd best stay away. But since I can't make any money by opening up the store, will you help me out with the service expenses? Welcome. Thief! Manager, help! Please pay! What the... Hey, you! Don't steal the merchandise. Police! Police! Hurry! Will I will die - Sawaki Go ahead and die. Oh, hi, Lemon? Kikuchi here. I need you here today. Won't see me for awhile. Listen, I'm expecting a lot of younger girls here. Keep that up, I won't ask you back. Fine, whatever. Hitched to another loser, huh. Just taking a trip home. You should see your folks too, once in awhile. That's beside the point. Listen, when can I expect you back? Your tank could use a cleaning, huh? I'm sorry. Hello. How dare you show up. Might be some reporters left. I'm sorry. How did the press get wind of it? I have no idea. Guess you don't have what they call luck. But the public's too dumb to remember for long. Just get lost for the duration. Go home to Karatsu and study those law books. Mommy, you're late! Hurry, we'll be late. Wanna go with papa. Let's go find papa. Wanna see a movie with papa... Listen, I really like you, so it's really OK. But I wonder why you couldn't... again. How many times now? Listen... You've changed since your mother died.

I've got my license, I just can't find my passport. I'm really sorry. Hokkaido's still Japan. Don't need one. That's right. Aren't you cold? Why don't you buy a jacket? Don't want to possess things. What an idiot. You'll just freeze. No need. For your opinions either. You are such a jerk when you're sober. Nor your impressions or evaluations. The opposite of an abusive drunk. I can pull off fitting in when I'm drunk. I'm a fool to have thought you were a nice guy for even a second. Unbelievable. Why my lousy luck with men. I've no luck with women either. What exactly is this beverage? 120 years of Innovation What a bunch of fools. 120 years for this? How should I know. What've they accomplished... Say, doesn't this guy look exactly like you? Privileged bureaucrat shoplifts! There's a resemblance. You've got your own troubles. Say, what's this? Sawaki what? Your first name. Sawaki Renji... A striking resemblance. A plain red handkerchief. No tricks. Really? Don't Miyo... OK. I'm stuffing the red handkerchief into my hand. Squeeze it in there, squeeze, squeeze. And in an instant, the handkerchief in my hand, moves. One, two, three! What's that suspicious bulge in Sawaki's crotch? What are you up to Sawaki, hey, Sawaki. Hello there, hello there Get it together, Sawaki. Had a date with the boss' kid sister? What are you talking about, let's go home, Miki. Who am I, then? You.“ why you're.“... She may be ugly but she's the boss' sister. You're the worst. What do you mean. You're only... What?

What... that's dangerous... I don't understand... What the... So dangerous... Impotent! Oedipal! Sure, sure... Isn't there another road? Why? The monotony makes me sleepy. It's like this everywhere. Don't fall asleep at the wheel. I don't want you to drag me with you. I've got places to go. Why should I die like a dog in this godforsaken place? I thought you wanted to die? What? What what? Why should I die? An accident here with some kind of babe and the press would go crazy. I can't do that to my father again. I can't believe no one's murdered you yet. Wakes you right up. Where did all the villagers go? To town. At least there are a few left. What a pathetic way to live. Because people like you, went “this land, that land" and carved it all up a long time ago. They all left because there's nothing left to fight for. Pathetic. That's enough. If you hate it so much, go home. If I had somewhere to go, I would. Hello. Renji? H's dad. Wait a sec. What you want? Didn't you get my message? Money I've got won't last. Listen, do you have any idea how embarrassing if is, to have the papers all over you! I'm askin' you not to get upset. They'll all forget. You fool! Your life's finished. If you think a public disgrace like yourself can show your face around here you've got another think canning. How do you think I feel! A little sympathy wouldn't hurt. Where are you from? Beats this place. Where? Saga. Saga... Where's Saga again? In Kyushu, of course. Kyushu, huh... Who's grave is that? Some drunk's. If he was a drunk, at least he wasn't evil. The idiot died half-buried in snow, right in front of the house. Yes, hello, hello... Kept you waiting. Why the sparklers? A present. Sparklers do for presents in Hokkaido, huh. Unbelievable. What's beyond 'those mountains? Hokkaido. I hate 'this landscape... Will you stop, please? Sure. Crow, why do you cry? Because crow has seven sweet babies in the mountains Sweet, sweet, cries the crow Sweet, sweet... I don't want this little one to grow up to be like us. Yuriko, Work hard, so you can send for her and raise her in Tokyo. Hey. Aren't you coming? I'm coming... It's just that I'm a bit scared. It's up there. A temple? Mom's new husband's a priest. Wait a little while, OK? I got it. I just remembered how we met. What an idiot... It's no use. Tm sorry.“... Tm sorry.“... I'm sorry to be so much trouble. Maybe it's my technique. I'm no good.

You work as an exotic hostess, huh. Hey... hey... What are you doing? I've nowhere left to go. Dummy. I can? answer the phone now' Leave a message at the tone. Is Tomita san there? Are you really not home? I bet you're just screening calls. I've really had it with you... You're awake. Such a good baby. You didn't even cry. If you don't pay me back I'll sue you...

So... You go alone. Don't want to. Bye bye. Don't bye bye me. You are a real jerk. And you are a real prince. I'll be waiting here. It's been awhile. Why are you here all of a sudden? I wanted to see Kaori. Well, come on in. First time in five years. Bearing a baby doesn't make you a mother. I know that. Where are you these days? Still in Tokyo? Doing what? I'm doing fine. I wonder... Kaori's ready for school now, and she needs real parents. We've just been talking about adopting her. My husband dotes on her so. How dare you! You can't go! Yuriko Yuri! No! Welcome, Yuriko san. I've been out of touch. If you're here to see Kaori, please go. She doesn't remember you. That may be so, but she's mine. It's not like I don't know what you're up to in Tokyo. Say you become her mother, what can you do for her? You'll only make her miserable. You should stay away, because you are her mother. But Yuriko san, If you leave Tokyo, and are willing to settle here to raise her, then that's a different story. We saved the money you were sending up until two years ago. Haven't touched it. There's decent work for you in this village, if you'd look. What do you say? Hello. Where are you? Oh, boss. I'm out here in self-imposed exile, trying to stay on my best behavior. I seem... Get a job there while you're at it. What? I told you to watch out for the professionals. Yes... Thai girl Miki is seeking damages against you. You believe that? Whatever the truth is, even I can't afford to protect you anymore. You'll get severance pay. That's the best 1 can do. He's made you a reasonable offer, Why not come back? Don't you want to see her? You're a grown up now. Time you thought about someone besides yourself. Don't hate me... It's really better for Kaori. Bet you already ate. Of course not. Really? You're the one who said you'd be home early. I got here as fast as I could. I went to the hospital, right? Yeah. And they told me the sex. So which is it? A girl. Oh, really. Disappointed? Sure? Positive. You said you wanted a boy. I did? You did. Eiiher's fine. Wow... The cake and stuffs in the fridge. Coming right up. Listen, Yuriko. I've been thinking I'll go out on my own. Out on your own? I won't get anywhere staying with my sales job We're having a baby, and it's 'time to make a move. I've got 30 million yen. Why can't you discuss these things with me first? That's what I'm doing right now. First of all, where'd you get 30 million? I'm good for some things, you know. It's just that I'm short 8 million. 8 million? You know that money you saved when you worked at that club? Won't you gamble on me? That was awful quick. Your mother still hate you? My mother told me to go have a good life. Some rain. You'll take care of the rest. Yes, travel safely. What's up? Huh? Forget it. What is it? I'm having a baby. A baby! We did it! A boy? You can't tell yet. Guess you're right! Good girl! Really good! Happy? Happy. That's dangerous, be careful. I'm sorry. Excuse him. No big deal. The toilets in Hokkaido... 120 years? Whatever, but the urinal's so tiny I pissed all over my hands. What? What are you doing? What am I doing? It took them all of 120 years to build absolutely nothing. Unbelievable. Give me 120 years here, and I'd turn this place into a real something. You really are impossible, aren't you. What kind of kid were you? Well when I was little, they said I was great. That I was the town's great shining hope. So you were smart. Yeah, well. 120 years here... Shut up will ya. After 120 years, this crap is the best they can do... All this guy can do after 120 years is trip me. What a laugh. Not so loud. Hey. What? Give me those. Don't bother... I have a great idea. Whatcha doing? The ink really sticks. What are you... Some people actually like this sort of thing. I've got to fill this in. Like one of my elder-classmen. What are you doing? No, don't touch it. Now you look really important. Well, of course. That's because I'm more important than you. Hey, mister. These aren't prescription glasses. They only work if your heart is pure. People who've only built a puny town, after 120 years of trying... I'm actually kind of jealous of them. This town... When are we going back to Tokyo? But even if we do go back to Tokyo, you've really got nowhere to go, right? You're right. Don't have the dough to go to the pink clubs. What's the point. And what'd they make, after 120 years of trying? 120 yen? 120 years. 120 yen will get you nothing. Nothing at all. You hate Hokkaido? Who's this guy? You went to a pink club? Let's go to a pink club. You're coming with me to a pink club... You hate this town that much! Huh! Huh! You hate it! You hate it... Pink clubs... pink clubs... What the... You started it, mister. What'd I do wrong... That guy... stank of clams. You're a loudmouth. That jerk, horse-face... He got upset because you kept insulting him. Ouch, ouch, that hurts. What is that stuff? You sure it's not pesticide... He was such a jerk... If we hadn't been inside... I'd have got him good... Forget it. I'm so tired... Sleep well. What's he got to complain about... What a jerk... I thought it would do me good to see my girl's face... I'd tried imagining what she looked like by now. I'm such an idiot... After 5 years without seeing her, I wouldn't know her if I saw her. She'll be fine without me... You're awful quiet. Guess I am. Driving fast, right? Where shall we go? Head back to Tokyo? You go ahead. Look, mountains... Where'd you get your license? Driving school. You've got the time. Get a license. Is it fun? No, it isn't. Life's about doing stuff that's no fun. Where'd the mountains go? I don't know. Where are we? I don't know. You don't know... We're lost, that's what we are... ...so exhausted... We're here, we're here... Hey, we're here. Hey, wake up, look! Look, we're here. Look what's here... A mountain cabin... We're here, hurry, hurry. Hey, there's even a hot spring. I'm glad I came. Excuse me“. Excuse me... Yes. Do you have any rooms? We don't take single women without reservations. We decide who gets to stay here. I'm not alone.

Take care, Tomita Yuriko Once upon a time, in a place far away, a little giri lived alone with her daddy in a little house in the snow. Her daddy loved Pride of the North sake and Hi Lite cigarettes, and he drank, all day, every day. It seemed that all he really wanted was to die.
