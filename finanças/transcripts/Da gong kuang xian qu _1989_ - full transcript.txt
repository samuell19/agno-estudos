I really can't endure it any more Don't you know you've done the Company an injustice? You're 10 minutes late Miss Wu, you're half right half wrong What do you mean? Do you mean your upper half are late and lower half are not or your left half are late and right half are not? You three have been late 17 days in a month You're averagely 10 minutes late every day, considering that your average wage is $5,0007? You are always late Do you know how much the Company has lost $200 Should be $211.05 Miss, you're a Cashier, you know better I have a pay rise only from the middle of this month Averagely the sum of wages of us is less than $5,000 I was 3 days late before the 15th. The average rate is $3.60 so it should be $200 I won't care to reckon with you now Anyway, it's wrong of you to enter the office before 9 o'clock Come in Why are you late again? In fact, I told them many times already Miss Wu, you shouldn't I concern yourself with such trifles Leave it to me to handle it Get away! Miss Wu, I clocked in only a bit late It's nice of you to know it And you, you always bring back comic books to read. Don't think I didn't know it How dare you say you're only a bit late? You're again half right half wrong Angie reads only during lunch intervals... You're making me mad. Anyway, with such wages You're sold to the company all 8 hours daily Morning, Auntie Am I interrupting you? You got into the lift when it was so crammed Sometimes I had to wait for over half an hour for the lift I want to consult you on something You go out to work Angie greet me Tell Kitty to type this 24 copies. I need it for the meeting day after tomorrow Okay Miss Wu wants you to type it in 24 copies They're required for the morning after tomorrow. Look at it! Miss Wu, this is Kitty. I just got a proposal and I'm not sure if I could make it day after tomorrow You know I'm terribly busy I've to charge O.T. if I get no help I see. Aren't you afraid it can't be kept confidential? Good, I'll have Angie type it Okay Damn, I got caught by Wu Tse-tien again today I confronted her so much, she might fire me If I got fired this time, it's be the 13th I've been out for work for less than 3 years I can't type or do steno with fluent English I thought this money-counting job would be suitable for me If I should lost it too Man might say I'm good for nothing What has it to do with Man? Yes, but... But what? We're not getting fired Who's got fired? What can you do for me? We were not late this morning, but we got a heck from Wu because I failed to cram into the lift It would be unfair if we got fired as a result You're half right half wrong Working outside is not always worthwhile Uncle Hsiu, you're in the same boat I'm not a redundant. We both are caged birds to be seen by others Uncle Hsiu Today's my first day. Let me make the introduction This is Candy She's Becky, he's the New Security Manager Albert ALBERT Hi, morning What a coincidence I'm sorry about what happened. Is your car alright? I crashed his car accidentally this morning and got a heck from Candy It was Becky that you hit, It's me, not her I won't talk with you now Uncle Hsiu, please take him away Albert, let's go over there. He was furious because he got cursed He damaged your car. Why don't you ask him for compensation? Nonsense, my car was in poor condition It's due for inspection next month. I can't afford to have it repaired Without a car, it saves money and trouble But you get more trouble fighting into buses and MTR packed like sardines And those lousy men took advantage once I got in Luckily you're tall Those men sweat like hell in summer I feel like nauseating once they raise their hands And some "Milanos" are cheap They read porno papers with pants unzipped It really is nauseating Right, it's better to drive your own car to work You won't get crammed nor meet these lousy men But it's costly to maintain a car Never. My dad's car is gas-saving I get a free car-park at my residence too The car-park in the office is free too How could it be costly? Didn't you say you'd let a room to others? I've thought it over. It's not too good Living with a good friend may spoil our friendship And it's inconvenient to let it to a bachelor Besides, mine is a government flat I might get evicted if the truth was known In this case, I've to return to Canada to join my dad You really are a nuisance "CLOSE" Wu Tse-tien's incorrigible. I really can't stand it Maybe she endured too much when she was a student She enjoys dictating things to others Hi, why are you taking so long doing it? Why are you so slow? Washed away? No, no tissue I really admire boys. They just finish and shake it What are you talking about? Well Did the teacher in your Commercial School teach you typing? Hey, why are you so late? Are you still mad at that? Well, it's not that Chi Mao-ying Chi Mao-ying Mao, Mao-ying Mao, good, good - Hey, there's no water - Use this He's given everything to you to do Nine o'clock sharp day after tomorrow, right? Forget it Why do we always get bullied? You can quit if only you get a windfall or go job-hopping I'll say the same thing too... Angie, there's a chicken feather in your lip Where? Where? Here. Let me flush it for you Have you watch TV last night? No, I haven't seen it as Lo Hoi Pang hasn't show up Yes, it isn't funny anymore We haven't played mahjong for a long time Yes, we can't find partners What? Maybe we can go the Macau next month after receiving the salary Great! Go for gambling I won't join you guys The ticket are so expensive You girls are really saving How's the weather these days? It's been raining here but Toronto is better. And don't forget Don't pile up used clothing, it gets stunk And boil some soup yourself, don't always eat Instant Noodles Take Cup Noodles then Hey, give my regards to Billy I give you my regards Sister, I'm entering University next month Hi, hi, hi, let me tell you a secret I've made a boyfriend Andrew He's nice to me, but he's a foreigner A foreigner?

If I won a Mark 6 lottery I'd change for a flat with 3 bed rooms and 2 living rooms I'll wall-paper it beautifully. This sofa has to be changed The whole flat will be carpeted The TV set has to be replaced for a 32" one It must have laser and surround sound And your room will be fitted with TV set and VTR too It should be smaller because you only have a dog with you But I'll hire a Filipino maid to serve us both Time is up Turn it on Lousy TV Hey, don't turn it off, just wait 41, 42... 42, oh, I'm rich! Take the noodles first If your work there very hard? I'll earn more so we can live more comfortably With whom? What did you say? May, don't eat noodles. It's time for dinner soon Dad, I'm talking.

We'll get our pay today Let's go out to eat That night, Man and I talked about emigration I was really excited but he wanted to bring his mom there too leaving me behind to take care of the child Don't ever commit yourself Why have I returned? It was stormy when I got there last year I didn't go out the whole week, I didn't eat well I don't know much English and can't understand what's on TV I did all I could to convince dad to let me come back If he prefers to emigrate, let him do it. I must stay in Hong Kong anyway Morning I want to get some petty cash Fill in this Form first Well, is your car alright? Yes, my car is shock-proof What about yours? It was only an accident. I was rushing to work Let me buy you Lunch to say "sorry" Okay. Have you filled it? Let me think it over first Okay, see you later Excuse me. Hey, are you going fishing tomorrow night?

It's me What's it? ...want to have dinner with you I'm not going Frankly, when I was a student I excelled in football, swimming, mountain-climbing and parachuting Isn't that a bluff? Strangely, I was a poor driver I failed up to 8 exams That's not strange Many people in HK won after many flops In Canada, that foreign examiner got fed up with me He insisted on giving me a licence on the 2nd exam I turned it down and insisted on wining it myself No wonder many want to apply for driving licences abroad Don't make fun of me I hit you because I'm a bad driver You're half right and half wrong I rushed to work that morning and took breakfast in the car Otherwise, you wouldn't have hit me so easily That's true too Wouldn't it be wonderful if Kitty and Wu were fired?

Albert's got no marks Look at his head and you know he's headless His long hands nearly touch the ground No wonder he flopped in over 10 driving tests What has he got in his face?

Quarrel again? Why do I cook and wash every time? And I've to serve his friends too I told you not to cohabit with him He's taking you for his wife and amah He said cohabitation is the vogue overseas And wife-swapping is popular too Sooner or later you'll be swapped So I insist on being single I've to take care of myself, but I get freedom People used to say "Love is valuable and freedom is more so There's much wisdom in it Oh, bad, I still I have something to do I've to hand it over to Wu Tse-tien tomorrow I had hunch earlier I told Man we were working overtime with you Never mind, let's not go to see a movie We'll stay to help you finish it. Okay? No problem. Anyway, I don't want to go home to see that creep That's a deal Yes I hear that you're going to the country to take a wife I went back several times a year. You know it What do you do? An OK Shop on, 24-hour business? No way Life is hard Have you eaten? Yes, thank you Goodbye! Goodbye! You girls are really trivial Just give you a touch To see whether it is real or not? Of course it's real You muscles are weak. You need more exercise Hurry up and you can see the 9:30 show on time Hey, I want to grow my hair long You want to imitate me? You can do it Don't ever do it, you'll regret Work, 24 copies each Hurry up! What's this? Are you playing Millionaire? No, it's real How come there's so much money here? Must be dirty money Guess how much it is? It mean's "flying a kite with foot hair" We must take chances Hey This must be dirty money Nobody's here Why take the goods lift? It's not so crammed Hey, miss You're office workers This way, please. No need to follow the queue I'm really happy today Nobody sees us No! How do we use the money? You like shopping best Police Don't worry. Smile, smile We've got a bargain today Yes, yes Stay calm. Smile... Don't look at them I really am scared Keep calm. Hold it. Get going Guess how much money there is here? Let me count it for you, I'm expert in that $10 million! Hey, not so loud! The whole Hong Kong can hear your voice! $10 million $3,333,333 each The odd balance is yours because you saw it first Holt it, could it be counterfeit notes? Don't scare me, I count over a million each day I note whether it's a real or counterfeit by touching it only $3,333,333 Why was such a big bag of money put in the street? Could it... Could the Company be selling heroin? Isn't that dangerous? We might be chopped to pieces or be spilt with acid You're half right, half wrong What if the Company really sells heroin? Nobody has seen us. If we don't expose it Who'd chop us? Well, could it be... Could the big boss be kidnapped? We would ruin things accidentally then This must be the ransom We still saw him in office safe and sound today Besides, the ransom is normally delivered through the telephone booth in the suburbs or in a warehouse, not in the office Could it be... Please be more optimistic, maybe the big boss will lose a amount of money, or maybe he wants to tip us for the decor Or he wants to subsidize you for a trip to Canada to see your boyfriend Or he wants to compensate you for your thrift No more nonsense. Anyway, let's keep calm and take things as they come Let's spend it as our own I've never seen so much money all my life Hold it, we mustn't spend it We all read in novels about that What then? We must attend office as usual as if nothing has happened When can we spend it them? We'll set one month as the deadline circumstances Whether or not to spend in then. Agreed? Do Besides, this is only between us three Don't ever tell others Not even to Man? Of course, or he may tell his mom and his mom may tell her neighbours, then the whole world knows it Maybe let's go abroad No, or people may suspect it Right How are we going to hide so much money then? Well, how? I have an idea Well, haven't you gone too far? You use it to store Martial Arts novels, don't you? What do you mean? My dad's former projector for storing blue movies and magazines Put it here then Don't worry My mom couldn't find it for half a century Let's all sit down To set your mind at ease, you two move in We'll have custody of the money together Tomorrow morning we'll each buy a lock to lock it Okay. Anything happens, we'll escape together I'm afraid Man may object It's serious business, not act of separation Right, it'll do you good to make him jealous A small parting is better than a new wedding And you can test out his sincerity too Right, let's hide the money first traveling, candle dinner We can say anything But coming to the club club girl girls are easy to handle By giving her some advantage she'd do anything you dictate her to Are you really doing what you said? Of course! Your wife's still not back Could she keep a beau outside? You can't trust women these days So much the better. I could save separation fees Don't be so cocky Little Chan in our office eloped with a shampoo boy this way Take care if she comes back to move things So much the better. You know my girlfriends line up from Tsimshatsui to Shatin Carol, Maggie, Do-do and Susan kept calling me and I haven't answered it yet A bevy of girls wait to be picked up by me Maggie and Carol?

The Company vied with the Japs for the Hokkaide Oilfield work but others have taken half of the business So the stocks have dropped and the boss in mad In fact, the Tangs can monopolize the business Right, I really don't understand Hey, the big boss Impossible. The Company... Quiet! Fish! Oh, a miss Right Well, my grandpa is not that cruel He was bandit chief but was beaten because he was not wicked enough However, he's horrible when he's in a huff The temperature may go up with a radius of 2 km Are you serious? No, I made an experiment and took the temperature What would he react if he got cheated out of his money I don't know My mom said someone stole his favorite Buddhist figure Has it been found? Yes, but the maid is missing So horrible? I'd rather believe it Don't ask me. I shouldn't have told you We've known each other for so long I promised not to reveal this I see. Who?

It should be safe now Candy's right. Let's spend it or not...

I have no more money in my bank I already said "no" People may suspect us when we spend it They may think we stole it We may get jailed for not reporting it I saw Albert whispering to a group of men in office Wonder what they were discussing Man may desert me if I don't tell him now Well, wait one week more, that's a deal agree You agree on anything Are you?

He's not worthy of you He plays ball Monday, poker Tuesday goes night horse-racing Wednesday, plays mahjong Thursday sappears Friday, goes horse-racing Saturday Ho goes out with you Sunday, but with his mom too Thank you very much indeed Sometimes he does care for me Everything is predestined. Don't worry Even if you get hold of him, he may slip away too Well, you alone are special Of course I've worked the whole night for nothing Well, let's get some old stuff to see This woman is disgusting Right Why has this man powered himself? Thank you for coming Thank you. Bye-bye What's on your mind? That blue movie you saw last night? Dreaming of Hawaiian beach in a week's time Hush! Uncle Hsiu wants you to go in What's it? Let's go together Go in and the ICAC will interrogate you like a prisoner You're finished Go now Where's Candy? Over here Come in and sit down I understand, Mr. Hu, I'll make a thorough probe I'll call you once I'm finished here Let me introduce: Candy, Becky, Mr. Lam of ICAC We've come to see the functions of each department and if there is any loophole of corruption No, no corruption Don't misunderstand! We're not suspecting anyone We only want to get acquainted with your functions They're the Company's cashiers, I only act according to normal procedures Could another department head ask you for money? No, we don't pay without Hsiu's signature What about collection? Does all cash pass through you? No, we don't collect freely Well, we don't collect or pay without bills If someone comes to pay without bills we won't collect without lettering him sign the bill We don't pay without receiving the bill Each bill is paid after the amount has been confirmed with Hsiu's signature We issue the bill with another signature by Hsiu We collect and pay against bills only Yes, yes Come in Pao Erh Hey, Albert, you're here too? Yes What's up? Are they collecting hush money? No! I was joking Don't scare them, they're timid I won't, it's only for fun You may leave. Thank you Go now This time it's "Abbot's handkerchief" What does that mean? We're finished for sure So serious? They came to get info only. Don't worry too much Don't worry too much Don't worry You're calm because you were not interrogated I've never been scared all my life When the ICAC men were here the air-conditioning was much colder Judging from the fact that they questioned you 2 only they must be suspecting us Right, luckily we were calm According to my analysis if they suspect you and have proof against you they wouldn't question you If they suspect you and have no proof against you they wouldn't question you to arouse your attention If they do not suspect you and have no proof against you they won't arrest you This is my logic Do you understand what she said? It means: Don't worry too much Keep checking how much they know Dad, you must help me this time You know how much is that gold mine worth? Tell him how much it's worth Around $8,000 million $8,000 million? You collected $200 million from that Jap and you gave him half of your shareholding! Dad, it was my fault. Auntie! You know? I was sweared by Chiu Sir today. I had to leave before that ball game was over Dad, it was my fault but you must help me, or I'll be in jail, you get jailed, and I lose face. I won't let you get jailed for that I'll confess it for you to ICAC I'll say I authorized you to collect the money As to yourself, go as far away as possible Sinking to grow honey dews or Hainan to chop bamboos, it's up to you What about Auntie? Dad Dad, give me another chance Me to forgive you to allow to perpetuate again? Bring back $20 million then Dad, I only have $19 million now Who put the blame on you or did you do it yourself? Dad, believe me, I'm speaking the truth Who know that you collected the money from the Jap? Only a friend I'm the more outraged then Why didn't you tell me that? ALBERT Yes Call Police Supt Chen. I want to talk to him Grandpa, that's unfair to Uncle Right We do business open and aboveboard but you the young generation has ruined us Albert, call him now Okay Mr. Chan, you know what's been going on Get out that spy as quickly as possible please I saw that night's hit book The signature was unclear because many passed What about the watchman? Watchman Ta is away in Sinkiang for a honeymoon Take him to see me when he returns and I'll have him identified Okay The money is of secondary importance It's crucial to get that suspect I've already brought those department managers concerned Go and meet them It's our duty to catch the thugs and get the money We'll do our best but whether there's the sum of $10 million and the blackmail remain a riddle What did you say? I can sue you for damaging my reputation. Who's your boss? Quiet Mr. Chen, this is our family affair I don't want to make it known, You know what I mean? Don't worry, we won't disclose it to the public Come in Uncle Granduncle Granduncle Three Uncle Grandpa Police Supt Chen. The managers who worked OT that might Sorry, gentlemen, something unpleasant has happened involving an extortion case You were on the spot that night so I want your presence I must take him to jail by every means Let me know if you go, I'll see you off at the airport Mr. Chen, did your security system record the looks of the suspects when the incident occurred? If we had the records, we wouldn't need your help We can arrest them ourselves Are you having a party now? Yes, but it was destroyed. The photos are unclear That's the crux We need these for powerful proof Never mind, that cassette can be reinstated Now let's see the first vision The vision you've seen shows 3 suspects then the second vision This is another vision. There's only 1 man on it We believe that man there is the bandit that night Quiet You must be one of them When do you think, Mr. Chen? A computer in Scotland Yard could turn the vision into digits rearrange them and bring back the vision We may take the cassette to Scotland Yard But this may take 2-3 months time Our computer has this device too I'm sure we can reinstate the vision in 3 days Okay. I'll put some men to watch it day and night There seems something wrong with the security system here Video tape Bang, bang. If your mom goes away she can't take care of you anymore Be nice Who didn't turn off the light after using the toilet? Damn, I'm damn scared I never had any sleepless night before Don't worry, it's going to be alright Yes, it's alright Nobody knows we did it. I'm not afraid Why can't you sleep? We didn't rob or blackmail We picked the money on the ground only No one wants to arrest you My dad used to say: HK is thrives because everyone's greedy We're now only doing our duty My dad worked like a slave all his life He didn't even buy lotteries He lived in a government low-cost flat Right.
