Couple days, maybe a week later, I went to a gay bar. One time turned into once in awhile, and once in awhile turned into every couple of weeks. Then, one night, bartender puts a beer down in front of me that I didn't order. - Looks like you have an admirer. No more cars. - So, why the waiter? He kept looking at me, and he would brush against me, and I was drunk. And I wanted him, and-- - Maybe this is who you are, Jack. You know, maybe you're a homosexual man, who's-- - Doctor, I don't wanna be a homosexual. - Uh, a bisexual man. - I don't wanna be a bisexual either, doctor. - Okay. All right. Couple of things right off the bat. First of all, you can call me Tracey. You don't have to call me doctor. For what you're paying, you can call me by my first name.

And I'm leaving Karla. - A letter, you, you can't write a letter. - That's just, that's just what I wanna say. I'm going to talk to her, face to face. I just needed to organize my thoughts. This is my fault, this is-- - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. - All my fault. - Don't be silly, don't be silly, it's not. It's gonna be okay. - Jack, I met someone. - What? - I met someone and I'm seeing him. It's not serious, yet, but it's going to be. Or, it can be.

You had a chance, and you didn't take it. I mean, if you really wanted out of your marriage, if you wanted out of that life, such as it was, that was a jumping point, but you didn't jump. - I had a chance, I didn't take it. ♪ Goodbye ♪ - I decided at a very early stage that we were going to do Christmas at least once on the East coast, bitter cold, bitter cold. But of course, that only means that we had to have a Christmas tree, right? You know, you can't have a real family Christmas without a Christmas tree, of course. So imagine it, my mom, fur coat, drunk to the tilt, we now know why. Dad's there bitching the entire time, but we get the real tree and we get it inside and we're happy, and we do what we can with decorating. It was our one and only, not a lot of experience in that market. And it's Christmas eve and we realize it doesn't have a star. So I tell my dad, "We need a star on the Christmas tree." He says, "Star, you're lucky we got the fucker in here." So, you can imagine how that Christmas went. First, last, and only East coast Christmas for us. Come on, we're going. - Why don't we have any black friends? Why don't I have any black friends? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Come here. Why do you put up with me? - Because you're mine. Doesn't mean I don't wanna throw you down those stairs every now and then. - Excuse me, Mrs. Armitage, can we smoke in here? - That's not funny, and no you cannot. - Someone's in a mood. - What do people say about me and John? - All right, they hate you. Come on, Pete, what's not to hate? You're perfect, you both are. I mean, look at that ass, perfect. You have the perfect apartment in the perfect neighborhood. You're interracial. - Sh. - Perfect, and politically correct. And the real tragedy is, even with all of this, you're still not happy, are you? - What makes you think I'm not happy? - If you were, you wouldn't give a shit about what any of us think.

Why are you here? - I do Pamela's hair, remember? - Looks great. - Thank you. So, where's your husband? - If you mean John, he was called away by his mommy for some family business this morning, but we're not, we're not married. - And why's that? - I don't see why we need to be. He did ask me. - Did he? - Yeah, last night, at the rehearsal dinner in front of my whole family. - On his knees, I bet. Congratulations. - Fuck you. I don't see why we need to get married. Why do we have to do everything the way they do it? - No, we don't, we uh, we make our own rules, Pete. - You're touching my dick. - I am, and I'm just making a point. - The requirements. - Hello How are you?

What, come on, Pete. - Oh! - Was that the first time? Why do you get caught up in all this fly-by-night shit? It's not love, it's chaos. Why can't you just be happy? - If Bruce comes tonight, which he probably will, please don't get into it with him, especially if he brings the new guy. Oh, what's his face? I know I know his name. Nevermind. But, supposedly he's been with this guy a little bit before him and Patrick were over. Michael Smith said we all met him that weekend in Rehoboth. Do you remember that? I didn't. I asked you a question. - Why are we discussing this? - Why not, it's just news. - No, it's not. - Are you gonna get ready tonight? - I don't think I wanna go. - Fine, you cancel, he's your friend. - I thought he was our friend. - Whatever, I'll do it. - No, wait.

David yes, yes, yes. - Well I run the gallery, Karla. - Oh, I'm just getting over a flu, and you are-- Oh, yes, I am. - Pete Logsdon, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - How much is this one? - 4.500, but if you're a friend of David's I'm sure we can come down. - Hey. - John, this is Karla, Karla, John.

Fiance. - Oh, fiance, Pete. Pete is thinking about taking your favorite piece home. - Really? - So. - So buttons. - Karla. - Yes? Can I see you just a second? - Oh yeah, excuse me just a second, I'll be right back, enjoy. - Mm, mm-hmm. - Would you get me a glass of wine, please? Oh, thank you. - And, don't say yes to anything while I'm gone. - How are you? - Incredibly uncomfortable, you? - Same. - You look-- - Yeah, so do you. - He's quite handsome. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. - I'm sorry about a lotta things, you know, the way I handled it, you, us. I've been meaning to call, I just-- - I wish you had. I miss you. Do you think we could uh-- - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm with John, we live together, I'm engaged. It's a bad idea. - I was just gonna say have lunch. - That's how it starts, right? Bye, Jack. - Gross, when? - John, can we head out? - Uh, this morning. - What? - They found Chris Randolph this morning. - He yeah, overdosed. - What? - Tina will take you down, child, it is messy, messy. - Well you seem to know an awfully lot about him. Did you two? - Uck, not me. - What? - David. - Peter. - What? - When? - Never. - Oh my god. What? - Guess who's here. - Who? - I know. - Who? - Nevermind, bye. David is just, wow. - I wasn't-- - I guess we're leaving. - Bye. - Hey mama, am I rich yet? - Well, I think I just sold another one for you. - Oh, all right. - Mm-hmm. - Mwha, that's awesome. To who? - Whom. - Yes, whom. - Whom. Pete Logsdon. - Oh, no. - Yeah. - No, Karla, he left. - Oh, shit. - That's all right, I'll call him. I have to anyway, he wasn't having a good night. - Oh. - Plus he looks like shit. He left because he ran into some ex-trick. Well not really trick, boyfriend with a lotta baggage. They were together for what, like a year and some change, which is like 10 years to the gays. And I'm sure they ran into each other, I'm sure about Pete, and I'm sure he was trying to avoid any sort of conflict with the ex and the current, who is smokin' hot, by the way, with control issues. - Uh-huh. - I think the uh, ex is probably worse though, he's married, to a woman, with a vagina. I know, people have told me about that crazy stuff. I don't even know what that is. - What is wrong with you? - But they're, they're frightening. Oh, there's married guy now. - Where? - Oh, okay, you want drama? - Yes, I do. - Okay. - I may need a little drama. - Stay, stay there then. - Okay, okay, okay, we'll don't-- - I won't be surprised. - Oh. - What is it, honey? What the hell? What, stop. Stop. - Fuck. I'm sorry, I just, I, I, I had to. I need to ask you something and it's very, very important that you tell me the truth. - Okay. No more hitting. I heard, this is, this is almost funny. I, I heard you're having an affair. Or had one, with a man. - Karla. - I shouldn't, I shouldn't a hit ya. - No, Karla. - No, no, I don't wanna hear this. Just shut up, just shut up. Oh my god, I need to think. I gotta think, I need, oh, I, I need, I need to think, I can't think. I need to think. Were you safe, did you use condoms? - For god sakes. - Answer me! - Yes, always. - Thank you. - It was just Pete. It was only a year, I promise you. - Did you love him, Pete? Yes. - Oh. Well. All these months, I mean, I knew something. I just, I, I, I really thought it was a woman. You knew? - I'm not stupid, Jack. - Why didn't you say anything? You came home, every night! I should've known, I, I, I should've known it was gonna. Miles told me about you two in school. Little more than a kiss, wasn't it, Jack? - When? - I don't know, sophomore year, I think. - So you knew before we were married. - Way before. What? I thought you knew I knew. - Do you know how long I've struggled with this? Do you have any idea, any idea what it's like to struggle with this? Why did you not ever think to help me? - Help you? I married you! I have your fucking children! - What? - No, it, it kicked, that's all. Oh fuck, it has, it has my temper. - The baby, we're having a baby. And then. - We'll raise him, we'll love him, and we go on. What do you think? - I love you. I gotta go. - Jack. Jack! - Can you sign those, so we can get outta here. Here's to your first time. Trust me, it never gets easier, just more expensive. - Well I'm not getting married again. - Oh, you never know. It's legal now. Don't look at me like that, I'm on your side. Marriage equality, fuck yeah. - Hot towels, too, classy dude, Pete. Where you want this? - On the floor, I'm gonna do laundry. Gotta clean up the evidence? - No, just doing laundry. - Uh-huh, this a big-ass loft. About twice the size of your old place. - At least. - You like living up here? - Yes. It's so white though. - What does that mean? - You know, across from Liberty Hall and shit. - There's an African-American exhibit right down the street on the corner-- - You sound white when you say African American. Why'd you call me, Pete? It's been three years, thought you were married. - Not yet, June. - I wanted to date you back then. - I-- - Couldn't date a black dude? - That's not true at all. - I didn't say "fuck," I said "date." Get to know, settle down with. Nevermind. You wanna do this again? - Yes. - I would, probably, maybe. - Don't forget your sweater. What you covering for? - I wouldn't bother, they're just gonna go in the trash. Do you want a glass of wine, or are you against day drinking? You should at least have some water, you must be thirsty. - How long-- - That was an arch conversation, after the hot, odd sex. - I'm, I'm sorry. - Do you need one of your little pills, or you all prepped up? Found 'em in your gym bag three weeks ago. Do you have anything to say? - Would you believe me? - That's a good question. No. Ah, I feel like my mother, that sucks. Say something, goddammit. - I fucked up. - Oh, big time, mister. Why? - I-- - Why, why would you cheat on me? Am I not enough? Is my cock too small, is it too big? Am I not here enough? Am I too close? I'm too wild. Too much vanilla. - I'm sorry, I, I really-- - You don't get to be sorry, asshole. We're getting married in six weeks, 200 people. In the fucking ballroom at the Bellevue. Do you have any idea how many times I could've fucked around on you and I did not? It's been going on for awhile, yes? Did you fuck any of my friends, our friends? - No. - Who knows about this, does David know? - Maybe. David knows I'm not happy though. - Then why the fuck stay? - Because I know I should be. It's insane that I'm not, I know that. You are everything to me, John, and I, I-- - Apparently not. I thought we were perfect, well not perfect, no one's perfect, but, ooh we were good together. We looked good together. Oh, shit. I am my mother. - No, you're not your mother, she's-- Cold and bitter, I know. But that's how I feel. - How can I make it up to you? What do you need from me right now? - Well, you can start by showering what's his name off of you. Then get dressed. And pack. And get the fuck outta my house. I'm going to get more pinot, this one sucks. When I get back you better be fucking gone or your shit's going in the alley. - Oh. Hey. Karla's here. - Picking the girls up. - Oh. - I appreciate that. - Is, is Michael sleeping? - He is sleeping. He was, he was up, I got him to sleep about six hours the other night. - Good job. - Yes. I'm really gonna have to use the Preparation H. Thank you. Oh, listen, um, Miles had a really, really bad episode. He's in the hospital. - What's this? - Go ahead. - Fairy dust. - Fairy dust. When they brought him into the emergency room he had some in his fist. He started throwing it around, albeit weakly, yeah. - Oh! - There was much more, but you know, if he was goin' out, it was gonna be festive. One had to pin his arm down to get the catheter in. He was fighting and, pulls his oxygen mask off. Then he yells at me, "Lighten up, bitch!" He's better. Still in the hospital but um, he asked me to give that to you. You should go see him. - I will. - He'd like that. - Thank you. - You got it? Are you ever gonna let me paint you nude? - No. Definitely not anywhere as cold as this, fuck David. - This building is 175 years old. The cold is part of its charm. No, it's not. - So, New York, huh? - Yep. - It's gonna be a lot more expensive. - I know, I don't care. Well, that's a lie. I'm terrified, but, I found a six month sublet and it's actually got a terrace. - Don't go. Please. - I can't stay here, David. I burned this place to the ground. It's not that bad. Yes, it is. - I'm gonna miss you. - It's 45 minutes by Amtrak. - I hate trains. So, it's good, right? It's beautiful. - Mm. You ever think about calling Jack? - Why would I do that, god no. - Well, why not? I mean, his wife knows now. I still can't believe you did that. - I wanted to die. - Yeah, join the club. - Oh my god, I'm so sorry. Oh. You should call him. I mean, they probably broke up already, right? I mean, how could she stay with him? - Please stop, you're just compounding the guilt. Which is why I'm moving to New York. - Running away. - As far as I can. At least I'll have a decent magazine job. - There you go, judge. - Thank you. Where the hell is she? - Just calm down, she'll be here. No, that's okay, it's fine. You go ahead. Ah, Mr. DuPont. - My apologies to the court, Your Honor. Uh, my client, Mrs. Washington and I, had to confer. We were as quick as we could be. - Your Honor, if Mr. DuPont is finished conferring, can we proceed? - Wait for me-- - What're you gonna do, what're you gonna do, huh? Oh that, that punk that's a lawyer? - Well, that went well. - At minimum, you put your foot in that. - Wasn't my foot. Want some lunch? You buying? - That judge hates me. The feeling is mutual, he presided over two of my divorces. Asshole. You married? - Yeah, second time, recently. - You get burned too? - My first wife died. - I'm sorry. Kids? - Yeah, a son, Pete. Thank you. - I like kids, I wish I had 'em. - Well, they don't always turn out the way you expect 'em, but you have to deal with what you get. - Sounds like you're disappointed in your son. - I didn't say that. I love my son, a lot, I just don't always like the things that he does. - Drugs, jail? - Fucked up relationships. He's in New York right now, starting over again. - Baby mama drama. He's gay, no baby mama. - My best friend just turned gay. - I think he was born like that. - Married the hottest girl in our class. Had two beautiful kids. One day it's like, he just fell on a dick, and liked it. Well I'll be goddamn. - What's that, you know Jack? - Yeah, my son introduced us. They were together. - No way. - Yeah, I feel really embarrassed about the way that we acted in public, I really went after him about it. - You know that he was gonna leave his wife for your son, right? - What? - I got an idea. I got a terrible idea. Hey Jackie. - Hey Eric, kinda got my hands full right now, what's up? You didn't tell me Pete was black. - Just tell me, is this nuts? - Well, nuts isn't exactly the word I'd use but um-- Tracey, please. - I mean, it is kinda nuts. But you're gonna do it anyway, right? Yeah, I am. - Well good luck, Jack. - This is so nuts. - And uh, yeah, it's more expensive to live out here. What're you grinning at? He's kinda cute, huh? You never give up, do you? I don't understand these people. - I hate cats on the counter. Jesus Christ, I mean how do people eat and, you know, mess with cat hair and fur balls, and. - I don't know. You want somethin' to drink? Uh, water's good. I bought beer. - Oh, okay, that's cool. Hey, girl. Not a day goes by that I don't think about her. - Me too. - You know, after your mother died and I started seeing Pamela, I took her to see your grandfather. - Ooh, how did that go? - Oh, he had a fit. I don't see why you gotta be takin' up with that white woman. - That sounds like granddad. - Wasn't prejudice. It was fear. When he was young he had to step off the sidewalk whenever a white woman walked by. Till the day he died, he, he carried the fear that I was gonna get hit in the head because I was an uppity nigger. He never understood the choices that I made. Be a lawyer, leave Louisiana. How could I allow myself to fall in love with Pamela? Most parents are terrified at the choices their children make. Deep down inside, all we want is just to, is for you to be happy. I'm sorry if I ever got in the way of that. - You aren't so bad. To being happy. - To being happy. Oh, shit. - What, what's wrong? Forgot to stop by the dry cleaners. I don't have a clean shirt for Monday. - Oh, hey well, damn. - No it's cool, I can make it. I'll be right back. 15 minutes, 20 tops.
