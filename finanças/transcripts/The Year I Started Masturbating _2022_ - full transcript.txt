[woman sighs] [phone buzzes] - [man] Hanna? - [Hanna] Mm? - You leaving right now? - [Hanna] Yeah. I was thinking about the completion of the vision statement. Gotta be finished before the board meeting. Totally. I'll even work late tomorrow then. I can work late on it all week. That's great. Uh, Ola and I are just eating popcorn and making up quiz questions for Friday's party. Okay. ["Jeg Kommer" by Daimi plays] [sighs] ["Jeg Kommer" by Daimi continues] [automated voice] You are ovulating. THE YEAR I STARTED MASTURBATING [song ends abruptly] Hello! What the hell are you doing? Hey! Just drive. - We're having dinner. What's happening? - [driver] The door is open. Yeah, what time were we having dinner? Seven? What time is it now? Well, it's not 7:00. I've got, uh, five to 8:00. Yeah, but we have a babysitter. - Yeah. - Damn it. Come on. Yeah, but I don't feel like it. - Feel like it? We had plans. - [driver] Hey, man. You coming? Guess not. Sorry. What? [Morten] You also got a parking ticket. I had to move the car. - Here you are. - Thank you. Can I get you two a drink to start off with? Yeah, a bottle of Moët. - Or is it pronounced Moét? I'm no sure. - [waitress] Lovely. - [phone buzzes] - [chuckles] [chuckles] [Morten] What are we celebrating? Us. Our bright future. Maybe. - Okay. - [chuckles] And so does that mean you've done what we had discussed? Okay. [sighs] Is that really what you want me to do? Wasn't it six months ago here you said something to me like that you would quit your job next month and you'd start working out and stop stressing yourself and everything? Yeah, but now it's more fun, my work is fun and it's nice to be able to afford stuff too. Mm. Oh, hey, and I have something for you. Or well, for us. - What's this? - It arrives in two weeks, so… Are you joking? [waitress] A bottle of champagne, similar to Moët. You bought a couch that cost more than a fucking Tesla without talking to me? It was a surprise for you and I know you love surprises. Breakfast in bed, that's a nice surprise. A gigantic couch called The Swan is not really a nice surprise. Hey, I bought it with my own money. - Have you had a look at the menu? - Yeah. I was about to do that. Thanks. [waitress] Yeah. Ah, so because you make more money than me then what I think doesn't matter to you. - Hey. - Is that what you think? Oh, God, no. That's really not the case. - Look, I'm sorry. - [waitress] Are we ready? I would really like to recommend our climate-smart pilgrim scallops. - Yeah, we'll have them. - Yeah? - You're doing it. - Doing what? Deciding what I'm gonna eat. What if I want something else? - [waitress] Something else? - Yeah. We do have a runner-up on the menu right now. It's Rocky Mountain Oysters. - Thanks. I'll have that. - [waitress] That's a go? That's animal testicles. But you knew that, right? [waitress] We also recommend that you order seven or eight different dishes. If you are a party of two, you can share, pick some, bicker a bit. Yeah, okay, but he'll be picking here. [waitress] Choose. Go ahead. Yeah. [clears throat] So… [smacks lips] Some herring. Herring might, uh… A third option of course is I bring out a whole selection of all my favorites. - Yes, let's do that then. - Thanks. Yeah. Thank you. [chuckles] - What? - No, it's nothing. I decided that she should decide. - It's different. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Absolutely. Exactly. - Morten! Hey. - Hey! I was in the neighborhood and I remembered you said you were coming here tonight. I thought, "I'll pop in for a beer," but it's crowded. Couldn't get service. Yeah, what the hell. [Ali] Do you know who I saw outside? - No. - Oscar. With the pageboy haircut and sweatband, my old PT. - Oh, yeah. - That man was completely ripped. Now, poof, the bastard lost all of it. - [laughs] - I was like, "Whoa!" He said he was on the keto diet and I was like, "You shouldn't be." That's what I thought. I didn't say anything. He didn't look good at all. - Yeah. - Anyway, uh… Hey. - Hmm. - Damn, I gotta pee, so… - [Morten] Yeah. - Yeah. - [Morten] See ya. - [sighs] Did you tell him we were having a date night? No, but he's allowed to be here if he wants to. What's the problem? No. No problem. - Good. - Like I said… [clears throat] I am going to start making an effort so you and I have more nights out like this. - Mm. - Okay, so, our… Oh, my God. We're in the middle of a sensitive conversation here. I mean, I'm sorry, but… Thanks. - Everyone's after the money. - [laughs] Am I right? - Yeah. - Seriously. - Mm. - [phone rings and buzzes] You gonna pick up? No. No, 'cause I'm with you. What if it's about Eli? - [phone continues ringing] - [sighs] Hello? [babysitter] Hi, Hanna. You need to come home right away. What? Did something happen? No, but Eli wants you to come home. What do you mean "Eli wants"? We haven't even been here for an hour. Whatever it is, it's fine. But his bond to you… It's critical for the child's sense of safety. It's important for him not to feel abandoned. - To be able to regulate your emotions… - Hey, we're heading home. Here's some bread made with black oats for you to try. [Morten] Can we get the check, please? Of course. I hope you both have a good rest of your night. Thank you, guys. Hope to see you again. - [laughing] Yeah. Thank you so much. - Take care. Well, come on then. [Hanna] Are you eating yogurt? Yeah. You coming? Uh, yeah. I'm just going to clean up a bit. [clatters] [exhales] [Morten] Hey, Hanna, did you pick up the hemorrhoid cream? - No, uh, I will tomorrow. - What? - [indistinct dialogue over TV] - [Hanna] Shh. Come on, I just got him down. [Eli] Mommy, I'm thirsty. [sighs] Okay. Here. We'll put it down here. There you go. [kisses] [gentle music playing] Why don't you put your bowl down there and instead eat me? What? Oh, Mr. Hansen. Mister Yogurt Man. Do you want to eat my yogurt? I'm taking off my shirt for you. Enough with this "vroom-vroom". I'm very tired. Can't we do this tomorrow? I want to see the "vroom-vroom-vroom" in your… [kisses] …underwear. [moans] Yeah, come here, my darling. Ow. Oh, I want you to kiss me all… [kissing, moaning] - Ow! - [laughs] - Be careful. - Sorry. Wait. You told me to eat you. Yeah, but, can you come in me so we can have a little mini me? I'm ovulating. Or, um… a mini you. I gotta be up tomorrow at 6:00. I don't have the energy. You don't have the... what? - [Morten exhales] - Huh? The restaurant? The Swan? - What's The Swan? - The couch. Hey, you know I can't come on my own. Right now talking about having a baby doesn't make me that horny, Hanna. You don't have the time for the family you have right now. I don't know why you want all this. [Hanna sighs] Okay, well, then… I'll do it. Do what? I'll quit my job for us then. If that's what you want, go and quit your job then. [Hanna sighs] [desk whirring] - Yeah, I wanted to… - Wait, hang on. - Oops, Obama. - Um… - [mystical music playing] - There was actually a thing I… I forgot the music. [music stops] [clears throat] I've been, uh, wanting to bring up something. It's not easy, but I thought… I've noticed you haven't been doing that well lately. All I can say is that you are not alone. My sister-in-law went through the same thing several years ago. Here. - What... What's this? - It's the women's shelter phone number. - Call and ask for Sofia. Great girl. - What? And if you ask me, I really do think it's time you leave the damn bastard. - No… [laughs] - You can do so much better. Yeah, but that's not it. He's not like that. - I said that before you... - You are a strong woman. You're smart, you're skilled, you're nice, and most of all, you're really fucking great. What... What's this? You are now our representative in all international matters. I thought you said that couldn't be worked out. Nice work. [exhales sharply] - Uh… Okay… - You're going to go to festivals. Cannes, Venice, Berlinale, San Sebastián, Gothenburg… Yeah, I know, uh, but I mean, that's not the reason I came in here. I wanted to talk to you about, uh… I'm not sure if you've noticed, but I've been stressed out and to be honest, I'm not always that great at showing it. Okay, yeah, that's fine. You don't have to give me excuses. It can happen to anyone. Strong women, weak women. It can happen to men. But help is available to you, Hanna. - Alcoholics Anonymous. - No… Google it. The thing is all this job would do is just increase my stresses. Okay, but I know you can handle it. If there's anyone out there who can do it, it's you. Hanna, you're the brightest person we have here. You're the absolute best employee we've ever had. You're fantastic. You're irreplaceable. I can't think of anyone better. You're well liked. You're good with people. You speak many languages. - You're just like, wow. - Yeah, but… Or what did you want to talk about? Yeah, well, I just wanted... I came here to... I just wanted to, um… to ask for a raise. - Uh… - [phone rings] - Is he calling? - Yeah. - Uh… Sorry, but I… - He knows you're at work right now, right? He doesn't respect you, huh? No, uh… - Well, uh, I'll think about this and… - A thousand more a month. - Well, but I… - Two thousand. You can't say anything to anyone! Especially not Ola. - [Hanna] Bye. - Bye. Anybody can do my job. Like pretty much. I'm grateful, um, I really am. [elevator beeps] Uh… [clears throat] What? I was wondering what floor you're going to. [chuckles] Just going up and down. Ah. Got it. So, anyone can do my job. - I mean, anyone. Anyone. - [elevator door opens] No… So, down again? Or up? [chuckles] No, um, just press six. I'm, um, going up. Good for you. - Hey. - Hey. Hey, I just want to talk about something. It'll have to be a walk-and-talk. I need to get home. - Lasse threw up. - Okay. La... What's Lasse? Yeah, the kids' goldendoo… Our goldendoodle. - It's chaos at home. - Shit. Okay, listen. I was just... I was going to… If we could… Just I'm quitting my job. - [boom] - [yelps] - [beeping] - God. Are you okay? - Fine! - Shit. Three thousand, then. I'm sorry, I can't do more. That's it. Uh, it actually has nothing to do with money, but thanks, really. You need to think this over, okay? Just go home. - Just think. - No, I made my decision. I, uh… Okay, okay. But what about the report you're working on? - What about, uh, festivals, you know? - I… - The Christmas party? - Yeah, you're right. You're right. Hey, I know this must sound so stupid, but my job's not that hard. Right, I mean, like anyone could do it. Even Asrin. - Asrin, who's she? - You know, Golnaz' niece? The intern? I think she would do a really good job. I'm gonna prioritize uh… other things. I'm sorry. Is this one of those Machu Picchu things? No. Uh… I just need to put Eli first here. That's it. I'm a mother first. Yeah. Fuck it. I hear ya. - Yeah, I, uh, just... - I'm sorry. But I'll comp off my overtime so we can... No need to drag it out. Yeah. Sorry. - [line calling] - Stop. [automated voice] You've reached Morten. Leave a message after the beep. [beep] - [child whining] - [sighs] [techno music playing over speakers] Oh! Hey! I didn't think you could make the Wednesday sessions. - I just did it. - You did what? You broke up with Morten? No, God. I quit my job. Whoa. Why? You know, it's just stressful lately and I promised Morten that I would do it. But Hanna... Wait, you promised Morten? What does that even mean? This isn't the 50s. You're allowed to have a boyfriend and a family and a career. All that. That's what you think. Well whatever. It's done either way. No, not whatever. It's gonna look bad on your resume. What are you thinking, Hanna? Really? After all the time we spent on your LinkedIn profile. Oh. Fuck. - What is it? - Ugh. Fucking milk ducts are blocked. [exhales] My whole fucking body. Everything hurts and leaks and sweats. [whispers] My cunt feels like sandpaper. Come on now, girls. Let's go! No resting here, right? - Let's go! Come on. - [chuckles] Gave birth three months ago so… Just go for it! Show me! - Sandpaper, really? - Sandpaper. Petter's dick is super chaffed right now. Oh, can you check out party venues with me this week? - My 40th birthday party. - Ugh, I won't be able to. I'm sorry. - I have much to take care of for Saturday. - Girls, is resting all you do? - Let's work as hard as the others. - Yes! - Just get to work! - She's gonna be 40 soon, this one! More reason to work hard! - Come on! - [man laughing] Forty. That's when doors really start closing, Hanna. [groans] You know the risk of a miscarriage increases by 50 percent. - Hey. - And birth defects. Petter also wanted to come and workout. You got a babysitter? No, Ebbe's asleep right over there. He's at Mini-Wellness. - What? - [grunts] But Petter! Fucking hell. He's three months old! It's a baby! You can't just put a... You can't just hang him up like a coat! [exhales] - Ebbe! Ebbe my darling! - [cooing] Oh! - Damn it! - What? - You're out of your mind! - [scoffs] What? A kettle bell could fall on top him. [cooing] Yes, I gotta go. I really gotta get going. I have to pick up some rain pants and a photo book and get some stuff done. - Yeah. - [blows raspberries] - Bye. - Bye. Don't forget. Naming ceremony Saturday. - Absolutely. - I was supposed to be working out. - Seriously. - [man] What? Okay. Let go then. I QUIT MY JOB [laughing] Do you think daddy will be happy now? Can you paint me like a zombie? A zombie? I can do that. Want me to paint some brains here? Like that? - Yeah, right here. - Here we go. [gentle music playing] [chuckles] You're... [laughing] It's wonderful. Hold your arms out like this. [zombie gasp] [laughing] [phone ringing] [sighs] [phone continues ringing] [sighs] Hello? What? Hey. I'm sorry. We came as fast as we could. Is that the Hulk? He's the Hulk. - What happened? - Uh… He was on a scooter and some dude came up. Tried to pick his pocket. So intense. I was going to register my scooter and I noticed someone grabbing for my pocket. I hopped on and tried to drive after him but then my front wheel got stuck in the NK Express rail and I fell off the scooter and I sprained my knee. And my Airpods were wrecked. - Oh God, wha... - Yeah. And then you ended up here in the hospital? Yeah. Eh, uh… Eli. Would you like to go get some ice cream with Ali? - Oh, what? No. Shit. - [Eli] I want ice cream. Yeah, I don't know, man. Well I was gonna get some coffee anyway. Oat milk? - Yeah, thanks. - Okay. Excuse me. How are you feeling? What do you think? Did you even listen to what just I said? Here you go. Here's one small paracetamol. Oh. Thanks. - Water. - You're sweet. Thanks. [giggles] You think so? Well, sweet means nice. In Denmark, where he's from. Let's see. It's crazy you fell off a scooter. I've done that as well. - You've done it too? No! - Yeah. [laughing] - Yeah. - [chuckling] No. Yeah, I fell too one time but it was on a bicycle, so yeah. I wasn't really that hurt actually. Right? [baumanometer pumping] [Morten] I keep wondering if this will change me. - Yeah, you believe the best about others. - Exactly. - Yeah. - You spend a lot of time with people. [nurse] I know exactly what you mean. I'm the same. - That's why I chose to become a nurse. - Really? - [nurse] Yeah. - Yeah. I work with people too actually. - Oh yeah? - [beeping] - Yeah, more creatively. - [nurse sighs] - I'm afraid I have to go. - Okay. - I'll be back okay? - Okay. - You go ahead and rest. - Okay. Thanks. See you. Yeah, I'll see you! You don't work with people. There are people where you work but that's not what me and Louise were talking about. You and Louise? Yeah. Yeah, okay, I get that I haven't really… been the best in the world at uh, managing all this home stuff, but things are gonna change. - Ow! Damn it! - Sorry. Jeez, sorry. - Why you gotta press so hard? - I don... [sighs] - [Morten] Ah, thank you. - Here. Where's Eli? Uh, he's over there. He found an airplane, I think in the play room. Mm-hm. Okay, uh, but… we still need a minute, so if you could just wait outside for us, all right? He might need a little peace and quiet. What about that? Or you could just stop hanging around like you're Morten's side piece. Hanna, cut it out. Sorry. When we get home I'll make you that cream cake you like. How's that? Man, cream cake? With his milk allergy? - Do you even know what he needs? - [Hannah scoffs] Seriously? Hey, my guy's pretty upset right now, Hanna. He's gotta go to the hospital just to get kindness? That nurse is way better than you. [laughing] Yeah, but she does that all day. She took courses in it and everything. - So? - It's her job! - I'm kind. I'm kind, right? - Uh… Hanna, you are many things but you're not kind and you're not chill. - No. [chuckles] - Okay but, who's more chill than I, then? - [chuckles] - Oh. Like everybody I know. - Alexander? - Chill. Chill. - Uh, Anton? - Chill. - Mega chill, right? - Chill. - Too chill even. - Definitely. - Ariana? - Eh… - Same as her, I mean... - She's like Hanna. Yeah, but you won't even let me near you. You get annoyed when I try to cuddle. - Why do you think that is? - [coughs] I only matter when you want something. [man coughs] - Can you get him water or something? - [coughing] He's choking, obviously. [coughing] Hey buddy. You want some water? Know how hard it is to live with somebody who always gets upset over everything? Who's never happy and always blames me for everything? Yeah, maybe it's better if you're not with me then. What? Uh… I could have died today. I, uh… Hanna, I don't want this anymore. We're not good for each other. Are you dumping me? Well, I did my absolute best to make this work. [cart approaching] [Hannah] Yeah, but... [sighs] Hey. I just quit my goddamn job. For you. Or for us. You quit your job? Why the hell did you decide to quit your job? What? That's the only thing you ever wanted! That's all you complain about! That I work too much! But it won't change anything. Right, Hanna? So, uh… You can obviously stay in the apartment until you find somewhere else. If you don't have anywhere… Of course I can find some place to go. I, uh… - But... - I know it sounds harsh. But I have to do this. You've given me nothing but stress and hemorrhoids. I'll stay at Ali's this weekend so you can have time to pack your stuff. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. I'll move out. On one condition. That we see a therapist. We have a damn child together. Oh. Fucking immature! [Ali] That was weird. [line calling] [Carolin] Hi, you've reached Carolin. I can't answer the phone right now but if you leave your name and number, I'll get back to you as soon as I can. [beep] [Eli] Why are you crying, mommy? Just glad I'm your mama. Okay. Honey, I'm sleeping at Carolin's a couple days. Why, mommy? [sighs] Well, 'cause… Uh, she's a little sad. And she needs my help. Yeah. okay. But hey, you and me will still… see each other and talk together on the phone…anytime. Mm-hm. [sniffles] [sighs] MORTEN - MOBILE 070-174 06 05 ASSHOLE [bittersweet music playing] [doorbell rings] Hey. - Hey, Hanna. - I'm sorry. It's just so stressful right now everything at home with Morten. I mean, it's just chaos. - I just need some place to, um... - [baby crying] To stay maybe for a couple of days. I got you. Yeah, okay. There you go. [sighs] Well I've been waiting for you to try to get in touch. [sigh] - Yeah, uh... - What the hell, Hanna? What about Ebbe's naming party? Fuck. [Ebbe whines] And you were supposed to be his godmother! - [crying] - [kissing] So, we have thought a lot about our relationship over the weekend, and we feel that we have had enough. Mm. - [Ebbe whines softly] - Mm. What do you mean, "we feel", huh? You're just gonna have to respect what we're saying. Okay, um… [sighs] Well I'm sorry for not… well... I'm not. You've just been all baby crazy lately, Carolin. It's like I never see you anymore. I'm sure you can afford a hotel room, okay? I can't, actually. I blew all of it on The Swan and so… It's a giant fucking sofa, but that doesn't even matter. I don't want to be alone right now. That's all. Sorry, Hanna, I just... I can't be the friend you need me to be right now. We'll be in touch. [bittersweet music playing] [door closes] [line calling] [Eva] Hey, Hanna! - Hey mama. - Is everything okay? - Yeah, I'll be right there. - Well, I'm not, really. - I'm not doing very well, actually. - I can barely hear you. Damn phone. And I can't really talk right now. Can I...? Hey, can I call you back later? - Okay, but I just want, um... - Okay. Sounds good. Bye! LOOKING (FOR A FRIEND) FOR TEMPORARY ACCOMMODATION IN STOCKHOLM. [sighs] [phone ringing] Hey, this is Beata Franzén. I'm calling about the venue for your 40th birthday party that you were supposed to check out today. Hey, uh… I'm sorry. I mean, my life has really been chaotic lately. Oh, no problem. I'll reschedule the viewing for you. - Tuesday at 7:00 p.m.? - Oh, yeah. That'd be super. Thanks. Uh, hey there. We're closed now. Okay, um… Do you mind if I use the restroom first? No drugs in there, okay? It's the policy we have. [sighs] No. - Absolutely not. - Don't you have anywhere to go? Yeah. Of course I do. My stuff, uh, can I just leave it here or… Uh, I don't think anyone will take it. CONTACTS LEYLA - CALLING MOBILE [line calling] [Leyla] Hello? Hey, Leyla. It's Hanna. Hanna? Hanna who? Hanna. Ninth grade? [car door closes] Nah! [laughing] I mean, you've got to be kidding me. - Ah, well. [chuckles] - You're kidding! - How are you? - Did you miss me or…? - Are you moving in? What's happening? - [door closes] Hey! [kissing] - Hey! [giggling] - I mean, look at you! Let me see you. No. You still don't have a backside! [laughs] - No. No backside. - [laughing] Damn, look at your home. It's so nice. You got your life together. Finally, finally, and I'll tell you it wasn't easy. - Oh. [chuckle] - So that's the little one's room there. - She is… - Super spoiled. And here's the kitchen. The upstairs. Living room right there. The fireplace. It's not on right now. There's a pool. And here's Emir's room. He's 17 now. You can sleep in here. [sighs] Teenagers. Oh, man. [sighs] Damn I don't get it. They're so damn greasy. So where is everybody now? They're visiting Micke's mom in Dalarna. Driving home tonight. I had a meeting. Don't worry, I put clean sheets on the bottom bunk. He can sneak in when he gets home. You could have had the guest room but we're renovating it now, so... No this is fine. I'm good. [Leyla] Okay. Yeah. It beats sleeping on the street at least. [bed squeaking] [squeaking rhythmically] ♪ Touch me now ♪ ♪ I close my eyes ♪ ♪ And dream away ♪ ♪ It must have been love ♪ ♪ But it's over now ♪ ♪ It must have been good But I lost it somehow ♪ [birds chirping] Hey. Hmm, good morning. Did everyone already eat or…? [Leyla] Please, Hanna. It's 10:30. They all left for work and school. - I'm working from home today. - Yeah. This is all bringing out my wild teenage self as usual, I guess. Yeah, 14 is different from 40, though, right? Double espresso. Thank you. - I know someone who can fix that. - Mm. Uh, fix what? Mm-hmm. Okay. [chuckles] Is it noticeable? Mm. Really noticeable. But, hey. What's going on? We're just taking a… a break, you know? A pause. So… I've got a couples therapist you can go to. He likes God and all that stuff. No regular Swede. Family values, etcetera. God's unity. - He'll get you two back together again. - You think so? I'm sure of it. Wait, I'll send you his number. I'll get you the girls number too, for… Hmm. [therapist] For it to be meaningful for us to work together, I think you both need to think very carefully about if you two want to stay together as a couple. Uh, well, I mean, I want to. Um… [clears throat] I guess, if he can change. You know? How do you feel about that, Morten? Do you also want a change from her? Um, no, it's just... I can't do this anymore. I'm done deep down, okay? Oh my god. Get a grip. Jesus. Women have done it for generations. [therapist] It sounds like you want to assign blame, Hanna. Huh? What? Most couples have things they need to work on in their relationship. But it won't necessarily work. And in those cases you have to be able to face the other scenario as well. Otherwise, things can become very deadlocked. [Hanna] This feels very inconclusive. I mean, can't we just make some sort of deal that... that I start prioritizing you and you stop whining? Hanna, you need someone you can't boss around. Or someone who's a pushover. Or a person who likes… pain. Hey, why don't we sit down and talk this out? Yeah, I gotta get back to work. Um… Can you look after Eli on Thursday? Yeah. Okay. Why? What are you doing? Uh… I have a… meeting. A meeting, Morten? What? You mean like a date? You met someone? [cheering] [indistinct chatter] Hanna, damn it, I've fought for this relationship for two years. You've just been too busy to notice how poorly I was doing. And now this is what it's come to. I want a quality life every day. Not just when your damn schedule allows for it. But I'm the one working like hell to get the money so we can make it. And you have this idiotic fantasy of what real life is. Yeah, because I want to feel good now. Don't forget we're meeting Eli's teacher tomorrow morning at 8:00. Oh my God. Are you serious, Morten? And do you even know how Eli got his damn waterproof pants in the right size? Why are you bringing up pants now? - What did Eli get Hampus for his birthday? - I don't know. - Because I buy all that stuff. - Whatever. I make sure that gets done. I get all of that stuff done every time. I do the shopping! I do the cooking! I do all that for you. And you don't even notice it! Damn it, it's you who must be reminded of Eli's stuff! Don't come at me with that! You'll be out buying your own damn toilet paper from now on! Quality life? We had a fucking baby together! ["It Must Have Been Love" by Roxette playing] Excuse me. The card was declined. Do you have another one you could try? Um, is there anyone you could call? Hey, I wasn't done. Hey, can I...? Ah, what? - Hey. - Yeah? - Financial yuppie dudes, in the corner. - Yeah. They still haven't gotten their drinks. - I'll take care of it. - You will? Yeah. I got it. God, this guy's so uncool. He thinks he fucking owns me and shit. Know what? Don't you worry. I'm gonna put your whole bill on him. Yeah let's do that. By the way, did you find somewhere to live or…? Yeah. I, um… Damn, that's great. Congrats. There you go. Great! And here are your drinks. [phone ringing] - You forgot your phone. - [phone continues ringing] Had a missed call from The Asshole? Oh, boy. [phone ringing] It's my ex. [chuckles] - Mm. - [phone stops ringing] [humming] Don't you have to serve the yuppie guys? 'Cause your boss, uh… Those guys kinda seemed mad. Yeah, I should. I don't know. But like his chi is all, ya know, fucked up, I mean. I don't know, I mean, it's like his energy it's… It's all over the damn place and like it's really fucking toxic. - That's what I think. - [manager] Liv. Hey. What are you doing? You can't just sit here and not work at all. I'm sorry, but I… I see that you're angry here. And I'm sensing a lot of negativity. He gets flustered easily, you see? I mean, it seems like… He is not at all receptive to an adult conversation. I mean, if I'm a 1,000% honest, this job wasn't a great fit anyway. You know what? I'm done. I quit. My bag. Ah, fuck it. I'll get it myself. Come on. Let's go get the litty in the titty. Don't look so scared. - It'll be fun. - [Hanna] I mean, where are we going? [Liv] Shot race. You look great. - But I think you should change your top. - Uh, what? - Just try it on. - What is this? Wait. Stand there. I'll give you some eyeshadow. - I mean, is this like for a baby? - You're going to look great in that. ["Leva livet" by Lill-Babs playing] [Liv] Are you watching this? [giggling] Stop worrying about a job. Just get a new one Well. And besides, you're the one choosing them, right? It's not the other way around. So hey. How are you doing really? You seem a little… blocked. What? What's your pussy say? Is it disappointed? What? I don't know. What things does it say? You have to listen to it. I think you need to let your pussy free. Otherwise, you'll be dead before you're 40. I turn 40 in a couple weeks actually. Right then. Guess you'll have to hurry. Close your eyes. And think about your pussy. Do you feel it throbbing? See this? That's all your unused life energy in there, Hanna. Like, that's where your life engine is. And it needs to be liberated. - I don't know. What? Why? Should I, um... - Stop being such a dork. Just open up a little. Check out someone you think is hot, and do the thinking with the inside of your vagina. Then look away for four seconds okay? Then look back. Sometimes you need something like that to get the system going. Prioritize your pussy. [beating heart] ["Leva livet" continues playing] - Yeah. Check it out. - Shh! You need to be quiet and leave before they wake up. [toy squeaks] Nice. A tribal. Damn, that's retro. When did you get it? - '98. - '98? Mm-hm. That's the year I was born. - [Leyla] Hanna. - [gasps] [exhales] [playful screaming] [girl] I'm driving. [groan] [girl] Yeah, mama! - [playful screaming] - [grunts] Hi, uh... - [girl] Yeah yeah! - [clears throat] Oh shit. I am so sorry. I'm sorry. I mean I… Oh my God. - [playful screaming] - Jesus! [playful screaming] - [Josef] Here's your top. - [Hanna] You were supposed to leave. - I don't know. - [playful screaming] - [sighs] - [girl] Daddy. Oh shit. [closes door] Fuck, I forgot my phone. [Josef] Hey, um, I'll uh… I'll see ya around. Yeah… [exhales] [doorbell rings] - Hey. - Hey. Yeah. Sorry, I forgot my phone. - Can I…? - Okay. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. One second. - [phone chimes] - Right. Here it is, yeah. [door closes] Do you want my shoes? Uh, no, thank you. I'm okay. I recognize you. Do you go to Maria too? Ya know, for addiction treatment? No. No. [phone ringing] - Hello? - [Morten] Hey! You on your way? No. Yeah. Yeah, uh, I'm on my way. A little problem earlier. All good. But yeah. I'll be there. Okay. Uh. Hey you know what? Uh… could I… Hey! God, I'm sorry I'm late. This day is just, ugh. Insanely stressful morning. Sorry. Thanks for waiting. [sighs] Really. [clears throat] [clears throat] Um… Have I missed anything or...? [clears throat] We're a… I thought maybe we could... We could maybe get a coffee or... What the hell is wrong with you, Hanna? There's children out here, Morten. You pulled out a used condom in front of the preschool teacher. - Yeah. - And Jesus, what the hell are you wearing? Wow, what's wrong with you Hanna? Where…? Where is Eli? Leave him alone. You'll freak him out, I'm sure. Hey! Hi sweetie! Hi, my love. Hi. I've missed you. Are you coming home? Not yet buddy. Okay? Remember we talked about it. It's gonna be awhile for that. But we'll get ice cream on Thursday when we see each other. How's that sound? [Eli] I have something for you. You do? Thank you! [Morten] Now mommy has to go. [clears throat] Okay. Hey. Morten. Wait! Wha... [exhales] Hello! Morten! [phone ringing] Shit. [exhales] The most hated woman in Sweden after the Bride of Christ. [Liv] Sure babe. Uh, Quattro Stagioni? I mean, shit, it was just chaos with that dude. You know? And jeez, my back is killing me. Never mind him. He is not important. This is about you and your life energy. That's what you should be focusing on. Like masturbating. - How often are you doing it? - [chuckling] Never. I mean, come on now, Liv. - Wait, what do you mean? Why not? - Well I get bored. Just laying there and thinking about like, buying stuff or everything I have to do… Take care of, clean. Shit, if I ever have the time then I'm just tired, not horny. You know, masturbation, according to research, releases like these crazy amounts of powerful endorphins. - Great for a backaches, for instance. - Gonna drink your cola? Oxytocin, dopamine. It strengthens your immune system makes cortisone levels go down, you sleep better. Hmm, how weird is it that I've survived this number of years. But that's like the thing. You are a prime example of how worn your hair and skin can get if you don't masturbate enough. I'm gonna show you something. Vital information, so pay attention. - Okay. - Jesus, what are you doing? This is your vagine. See here? This is the mons veneris. These are the labia, this is the vagina, and this, this is the clitoris. - Are you getting this? - Yeah. You're talking so loud. Your vagina is the only part of your whole anatomy that actually is made specifically for providing pleasure for you, Hanna. There are eight fucking thousand nerve endings in there and you've been missing out on all of them. Anyway, here, about three to five centimeters up is the G-spot. That's what makes you able to get lovely fountain orgasms or like squirt. That's the G-spot. Then in between the anus and the vagina, that's your M-spot. With some light pressure, you can have the greatest orgasm in the world. Below that, if you rotate, imagine that you're turning like this. So that you're against the anus. This back wall is soft and nice towards the anus. That's your O-spot. - The shrimp? - The shrimp. - Okay. - Obviously. Easy to stimulate during anal sex. Then there's the P-spot. On the urethral orifice. If you stimulate it right, you can come like a man is able to come. You're wasting your wonderful woman's body. You should have been born a man. You've been given a total amusement park and you've been wasting it. [laughing] Thanks. Great. What're ya waiting for, Hanna? Go ahead and masturbate! Yeah, but where? I'm like homeless. Buy the thing I'm texting you and then go find a corner to masturbate in. Okay, sending it now and then I gotta go. I wanna hear everything about the masturbation thing later. - Yeah. - Yeah. Prioritize the pussy. - Okay, babe. Goodbye. - Everything good? - Yeah. K, bye. I'll pay for us. - [man] Yeah. [door opens] Oh, my! Hanna! I've called you but you haven't picked up. Is, uh… is everything alright? Yeah, Mom. Everything's okay. Just hoping I'd be able to stay here for now. Right now it's just too chaotic at home for me to be able to work, you know? Um… - Of course you can stay here. - You were on your way somewhere. Oh, Hanna, it's fine. We can cancel. We're always here for you. You know that. I'll call Gunilla. I'm gonna tell her we're not coming. New shoes? - Yeah. - Chic. Yeah. No. Tell me how you are. - No, I'm fine. - [Eva] Mm-hm? - Just been, uh… pretty stressed. - Mm. Did Morten leave you? [exhales] Why would you assume he was the one who left? Yeah. Uh, yeah. Yeah. - Oh my goodness. - [sighs] - Oh, honey. I'm sorry. - That's awful. Well, then I think you are really lucky that you have a good paying job right now. If you're going to be on your own, I mean. Mm. I, uh, just quit my job too, actually. Oh, well, uh… Eva, don't worry. It's okay. People freelance a lot these days. Yeah, I was thinking about freelance work. - [Eva] Yeah. - [Marco] Mm. [intriguing music playing] TORCH MARCH AGAINST NUCLEAR WEAPONS WOMEN FOR PEACE [intriguing music continues] [phone rings, buzzes] [sighs] Hello? [Beata] Hey, Hanna! It's Beata. You had an appointment for viewing our party venue yesterday. Mm. The party's not happening now. No, wait, we can easily... [sighs] [Hanna] Good morning. Oh, good morning sweetie. - Did you sleep well? - Absolutely. Or well, not really. - Coffee? - Yes, please. Mm. - Ah, here you go. - [Hanna] Thank you. [sighs] - What is it? - No, it's nothing. I was just thinking that it might be good for you to take it easy for a bit. - You've been working so much. - Mm? But work is the only place where I'm not criticized for who I am. But maybe Morten will come back to you if you work a little less. I know it's been tough, but I didn't think that this would happen. I didn't either. [sighs] [Eva] In that case, it'd be great if you could work it out. Hanna! [Hanna] Yeah, but I need to get a job. [sighs] [seat bumping] [sighs] Honestly, there's really nothing more I want than for you to be here. Seriously. But I already hired somebody for your job. Oh, yeah? Okay. [chuckles] - That was quick. - Yeah. Asrin. I gave it to her. - Asrin? - Good idea, by the way. Thank you. That was something I just said that day. - I didn't really... - But she needs an assistant. Ah. My God. [giggles] Hanna! [Asrin] Hey! I didn't understand. Why'd you quit all of a sudden? Come on! - Let's get a soda. - No. Yeah. Alright. So, tell me, you got the Netflix job. - Uh, well no, I just... - That's so amazing! And finally! It's so great that the job goes to a woman and someone your age! Congratulations. Fucking Netflix! Yeah. Uh… - We deserve sugar, don't we? - Yeah. - Yeah, thank you. - [giggles] No, no. I… I didn't get that job, so, I actually don't have a job now. [Hanna] I talked to Staffan and he said that you needed an assistant or help with some things and I thought… Yeah. Hmm. Okay, let me just check the calendar. Yeah, it's a little tight, but you know what? Come on in. We'll do the interview right here. Interview? Okay, I… I mean, I… Yeah, I used to have your job. You… Uh, you worked here as an intern. Yeah, but it's very important to do everything correctly, so that there's no talk of bias or anything. And that you possess the right motivation. - Mm. - That's super important. So, um, what is your timetable experience? - Can you do scheduling? - Um… Yeah. - Sure, yeah. - Mm. Good. That'll be helpful and, um… Which word describes you the best? Goal-oriented, individualistic, or are you cooperative? Well, I guess I am goal-oriented. [clears throat] And, uh, cooperative. And all of it really. - That's what I would say. - Yeah. Classic response. [chuckles] Perfect. Uh… Do you have a basic understanding of the Microsoft suite, Hanna? Like Excel and Keynote? I know you did that course, but I had to help you last time, so… Yeah, you did that and that was because I gave you… gave you assignments and stuff. Being an intern. Yeah, okay. Alright. I was just... I was just checking. - Um… - Yep, exactly. Okay. You know what? Uh, let's do this one instead. Can you describe one instance in your career where you did actually exceed expectations? [elevator rumble] - [man] Oh. - [exhales] Well. [chuckles] Hey. Hi. [chuckles] Just riding the elevator up and down again? - [laughing] - No. [chuckles] [clicks button] Take me wherever you're going. Absolutely. Adam. Hanna. Yeah, my buddies gave me a singing course as a gift. An experiential gift package. - Go ahead. We're here. - [Marie] …all the way to the head voice. [Marie vocalizes high-pitched note] - Hi! Welcome. Hi. - [Hanna] Hi. [Marie] Drop in. Great. You can just keep on breathing. Breathe in. [inhales] And then out. [exhaling] And just breathe a couple of times. [inhaling] Let out all the stress. [Marie exhales] Yeah. Babies have the ability to scream and scream and scream. Why is that? Hm? Oh, and dogs can bark as much as they want… - Sorry for squeezing in here. - …without getting a sore throat. Why? - [Hanna] I'll stand here. - They use the power of the womb. - [clears throat] - Let's do barking. Let's try it from the ground. Get down on all fours. - [chuckles] - And start in your pelvis. And everyone, let's bark like a big brown Labrador. [barking] - [Adam] Woof! - [laughing] - [Marie] Thank you. Fantastic. - [laughs] And now we're gonna try barking… Ooh, like a Cocker Spaniel? [Marie] Yeah, a Cocker Spaniel. - [chuckles] - Be my guest. [barking] Ruff! Ruff! [barking] Arf! Arf! - [barking continues] - [Marie] Well done! - Thank you, thank you. - [laughing] Out with all the negative energy and in with the good. [breathing deeply] [Marie] Hi. What's your name? Hann... Hanna. [Marie] Hey, Hanna. I think we should start with you. - Okay. - Come. - What do I do? - Come. Come. - Relax. - [clears throat] Okay. Yep. [Marie] Our voice reflects our inner power. - Okay. - Its vibrations can heal lots of things. Like negative energy. - And physical problems. - [chuckles nervously] The vagus nerve… [inhales] a… a very important part of our internal system, is stimulated by singing. Go ahead now. Sing a song. - What? - Sing a song. - Sing a song? - Mm. Uh, I really can't sing at all, though. I can't sing at all. [laughs] [Marie] I'll count to three. Just go with whatever comes to mind first. - [Hanna] No, I mean, I'm not at all... - Yeah. One… two… three. ♪ On my pillow ♪ ♪ Leave the winter ♪ [Marie] Sing from the womb. [Hanna] ♪ On the ground ♪ ♪ I wake up lonely ♪ - ♪ There's air of silence ♪ - [farts] - [Marie] Whoops! - Can you... Can you just... - Can you let me go? - [Marie] Absolutely. - Can you please stop? - Absolutely. [Hanna] It was just a little, uh… I need to go to the restroom. - And then I have this thing. - [Marie] Yeah. You're very welcome back. - Thanks. - Whenever you want. Let's say bye to Hanna. Shit, my life is just… [sighs] At least you sang from your womb. Yeah, but I quit my job in favor of the relationship and now we're not even together anymore. I have no job right now. Well, they offered me the position of an assistant for the thing I did before. Mm-hm. And you? What's your impression? Hm… Well, you have a mom who adores you. Ouch. I wouldn't say that. You probably have at least one child who can sleep a full night. You have a girlfriend from… Nyköping, who is about to get a doctorate. - Wow. - [laughs] Good guess, but you're wrong. [chuckles] - It may be time for that soon, though. - What? - The girl from Nyköping? - Mm. [smacks lips] Unfortunately, she doesn't exist either. Okay. So, you're a guy who's emotionally open to being interrupted every night for four years? Yeah. Correct. Hey, I wanted to ask if I could take you to dinner. Unless you're scared of heights, but you seem brave. - [both laugh] - [gentle music plays] - [Adam] Here, let me help you. - [Hanna] Oh, thank you. [gentle music playing] [inaudible] - Okay. - [laughing] - Yeah. - [laughing] [phone buzzes] THE ASSHOLE CAN YOU COME BY WITH ELI'S HARMONICA? [gentle music continues] [Hanna] Oh, my God, that kiss was amazing. [chuckles] It was completely different than Morten's. We're going hang-gliding tomorrow. - Hand-gliding? - Hang-gliding. - Some experiential thing. - Okay. But you don't know him that well yet. I mean, it's kinda fast. Yeah, but I don't know. - He's so special. Know what I mean? - Okay. Hey you. Let's go. - Shit. I'm sorry. I'm coming, I'm coming. - [sighs] No, fuck it. Now I'm feeling anxious. I'm not doing it. Bad idea. What's your pussy say? - My pussy's going gliding. - Good. Okay, now look. This is the crossbar, which holds the wing in place right here, right? And here we have the rigging with the wires. And it's very important that you check that these are in order, so that they're not screwed in crooked. Then you attach the hook. There you go. Now you can try to lie down. [woman] Like this? [instructor] Yeah. Yeah. Then we'll hang the harness like that. Let's see. There you go. Looks good. Yeah, just like that. Be careful of this part over here. There you go. Nice. [sighs] [bittersweet music playing] [line calling] [sighs] [line calling] - [phone ringing] - Oh, hey. [Hanna] Yeah, hi. How are you guys doing? [Morten] Good. How are you? I'm alright. [sighs] So… So I got this new job and it's… it's not at all demanding, so that's… That's good. That's good. I've also started learning how to destress and all that. And I've been singing. Just did that once. So… And I did one of those hang-gliding things. And that was pretty fun. It's like when you fly around. Starting to feel more like myself. Now. [Morten] Okay. So, how is it going with, you know, finding your own place? Well, yeah, I think it's getting there. I've been looking at places for a while, but, um… I did feel a little bit bad about putting you in that situation. Um… But it is my apartment, so, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You wanted to talk to Eli? Yeah, and I thought you and I'd be able to like, uh… - You can talk to mommy. - [Eli] Hi. I love you. I love you too.

Mm. Thank you. And here's half a balcony. A nice French balcony. Really nice furniture too. - [Hanna] Seventeen thousand, right? - [realtor] Nice wallpaper. Mm-hm. Mm. Fridge, freezer, stove, microwave. Ah, you name it. Huh? It doesn't get any better. No. Perfect. And look at this. The bedroom. Nice view of the courtyard. Bathroom. Shower. What... What's in there, then? [realtor sighs] It's rented out. - Mm. - Oh. But I think you should go for it. You know, the rent is actually really competitive for Södermalm/City, and so it doesn't get any better than this. [line calling] [Carolin] Hey, Hanna. Listen, I'm sorry I can't talk right now because Petter has a cold, but I'll call you later, okay? Kisses. [phone buzzes] THE RASPBERRY CAVE - A BOOK ON VAGINAL SEX LIV: DID YOU LISTEN? I'VE RENTED AN UGLY APARTMENT AND ADAM HAS GHOSTED ME! WHO'S ADAM? BUY THE STIMULATOR LIKE I SAID [Sandra Dahlén] The vagina can be a good gauge of life and how we are feeling. Seeing the vagina like a person, who keeps everything on track for you… [buzzing] …can be a tool to get a sense of well-being. [buzzer pulsing] What does the vagina want you to do? Will the vagina be happy if you cut down on expenses so that you can work less? - [buzzing] - [exhales] If you plan in some free time, start dancing, take a bubble bath, read comics, short porn stories. - Take up horse back riding. - [moaning] - [buzzing] - [moans] The vagina want you to let out your inner slut?

[chuckle] Yeah. Yeah, yeah. [sighs] ["Ave Maria" continues playing] [Sandra] The important thing is to care about others, but to not forget about yourself. When does the vagina say no? Hanna? Hey. You know you're late right? Hmm? I had to take all the notes at the meeting. - It was super stressful. - [Hanna] Yeah. I'm sorry. BE ON TIME! IMPORTANT - Hanna. - [gasps] Hi. - Hi. - Everything okay? - Mm-hmm. - Mm. Well yeah, I was, uh, talking to Asrin and we felt it would be great if you could, um, empty the, uh, office storeroom. We need the space and stuff. Uh… yeah. Okay, that's great. Uh… I'd like to help you right now, but I've got a full plate. So, I can't. - Now or? Yeah? Okay. - Yeah, please. Please. Uh… one more thing. Uh, so about the vision document I'm working on something that's… Well, it's... it's based on the old one that you wrote. - It's really well written, so I thought… - Mm-hmm. Uh, I was thinking you could just keep on… doing it? - [phone ringing] - Yeah, like finish it later. - Hm? Uh… - [phone continues ringing] [Hanna] Let me see who's calling and I'll take care of it. [phone continues ringing] Okay. [sighs] - Hello? - [Morten] Hi, Hanna. I'm standing here with your gigantic sofa and I almost broke my back carrying the parts up to the apartment. Tell me you're going to rent a van and come pick it up. Yeah, but uh… It was... It was a gift for you so what do I… Yeah, but it takes up all the space in the apartment so it can't stay here. Come get it. [sighs] [line calling] [Petter] Hey. Carolin can't talk now. She's resting. I can't either. Bye.

You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Where's…? - [clears throat] - Where's Eli? He's playing with Legos. - Hi! - Louise. Uh… you two've met. - Yeah. - Hey. And you usually check out my Insta stories, right? [Hanna] Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's right. Oh, yeah, you look like a cool girl so, that's good. [forced chuckle] A girl who doesn't have anything of their own to… you know? Who only thinks of you. Pillows, food, all that. Yeah, so about the sofa… - You probably want these. - Yeah. [chuckle] Thanks. And also I was gonna take that painting now too, if that's okay. - Already? - Mm-hmm. But that one's ours. Yeah, but I got a van here and I was the one who paid for it, right? So maybe it's a little bit, uh… more mine? [playful music playing] Shh. Ebbe's sleeping so… Oh sorry, I don't wanna bother you guys, but I need to speak to my friend. She feels really let down by you right now, Hanna. And she's very tired. All the hormones and stuff. - It's a special thing to become a mother. - Yeah. I know it is. - I... I'm a mother. - [scoffs] Yeah, but you're more of a mother on the side, right? - No. - Wait. - Move. - Wait, don't make a scene, okay? - Move over. - Hanna, no, wait. [high-pitched sounds] [Hanna] What the hell are you listening to? [Carolin] Our fucking anxiety aquarium. [Hanna sighs] - I mean, I'm sorry. - Hey. - I've been a pain in the ass to you… - Shh. Come on, Hanna. And I know that lately I've really gotten wrapped up in my own stuff. But I'm struggling here. I'm going through the worst crisis in my life and you're not fucking there for me. Just 'cause I didn't show up to your bougie fucking naming thing for Ebbe! All the two of us have gone through, I thought that'd mean more than any of that. So you know what? Fuck you too! - Shh… - I'm the... - Who was there to help with the... - Hanna, really. - The whole... - You gotta go. - Stop it! - Hey. Shh. - You're going to wake him up. - Shut up a sec. You needed me, and... And I did it all. This "get pregnant on your own" thing before you met this idiot, with his Joe Rogan and Jordan Peterson quotes. All our trips to Denmark. You and I go back for so long. For the last 20 years, I've been there for you, girl. And then at the moment when I really need you, you immediately dump me. Like suddenly I'm the one who's been the bad friend. We don't want this negative energy. Can you... Can you hear all that mansplaining fucking know it all, talking for you? - [baby crying] - Can you? Really? Is the fucking echo in here loud enough for you? Huh? - Call me when you wake from the psychosis. - [Petter] It's okay. Shh, shh. [baby crying] [Petter] Okay, sweetie. [Hanna] Well that was liberating, but honestly it was all a bit Agatha Christie-ish. There's no one left now. No Morten. No Carolin. - No Adam! - Oh, chill out! They seem really uncool, anyway. Damn it, come on. Chin up. You know I usually think all the love songs are about me? Like, "You are the most beautiful thing I know." "Nothing compares to me." And that V is singing to me. ♪ Lean on me ♪ ♪ When you're not strong ♪ - [giggling] - We need to change your track. No, I don't like this music. Pick something else. Start with a little sage cleanse. - It like removes all the bad energies. - [giggling] - It gives you some good vibes. - Hey, we've gotta get going now. Sweetie, come here. Yeah, I'll take the twig. It's fine. - I'll try it, I promise. - [Liv] Good. - [chuckle] Did you have fun? - Mm-hm. - Good. - [Liv] Later, Eli! [Eli] Bye. [chuckling] [gentle music playing] God you're jumping so far! I can't jump that far. Oh! [laughing] If you could choose any apartment Eli, which one would you... - None! They're all so crappy. - None at all? - [giggling] Come on. They are not. - Yeah, they are. - Exactly none. - [Hanna] None? - Ah, none. - [Hanna] Meh. Why? That one! [Hanna] Yeah, that one's pretty. Don't you like the brown one with the round windows? - Nah. - [Hanna giggles] - [Eli] Mommy? - [Hanna] it's really nice here. Yeah, isn't it? [gentle music continues playing] [sniffs] [breathing heavily] [exhales] [groaning] [inhales] [groans] [Sandra] Keeping your pussy in mind, you can make decisions that make you feel good. - Hi. - [Sandra] Not just in the moment. But in the long run. Then you have to ask yourself, "What makes my vagina feel good?" "When is my vagina happy?" Hi. [Sandra] Does your vagina think you should quit working, and start studying? Uh, hey, I emailed you a link to an audiobook. If you could, um, maybe listen when you get a chance. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, fine. - It's no Gunilla Bergström but... - Uh, no problem. Super. Thank you. [Sandra, over speaker] It can be extra exciting to masturbate and watch yourself in the mirror at the same time. You can also try to photograph yourself. Or maybe you want to read or watch something before or during masturbation. As a starter or as an enhancement to the sensation. Spread the inner labia. Lift the clitoral hood. Spread your pubic hair so that you can see your perineum. All of these things, all of these amazing, weird or goofy or beautiful parts, are there for you to enjoy and explore yourself. [audiobook narration stops] What? Huh? Was that really so horrible? Huh? Is there no one here that knows that masturbation makes you happier? That it's good for stress, back problems and things? Yeah, it reduces stress. Which in turn makes you way more productive at work, you guys. Thirty-nine percent of men masturbate at work and only six percent of women do. I'd say men all know what I'm talking about, right? Ola? People who masturbate are generally better at leading. Staffan? How about a masturbation break at work or something like that? Vibrators instead of stress balls. That's an idea to put in the bags at the office socials. - Uh, that... that's... that's an idea. - [Hanna] Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm gonna uh, I'm actually going to finish listening to this chapter. - If that's okay. - Uh, okay. Can we fix this Bluetooth thing too, Staffan? - I mean, it was weird for all of us. - [Staffan] Mm-hm. I… think you need to log out. Yeah, I'll... I'll have a look at it so… [upbeat music playing] Stop, look and listen. Stop, look and listen. [Adam] Hanna! Wait. [clears throat] I've been thinking about you. Uh, did you go hang gliding? I'm sorry. I really wanted to go, but everything got messed up. I tried to get in touch but I didn't have your number so I couldn't call you. - Sorry. - I didn't even notice you weren't there. So how was it? Fantastic. Life-changing. You know? What about you? Are you still in the group-singing class? No. No, no, I mean, uh… Uh, my mother was put into hospice that same day we were supposed to meet, so I was with her. Oh. God, I'm so sorry. How is she? Uh, she has cancer. Uh, so yeah. She only has a few weeks left. Life, you know? But, uh… [inhales] It feels good to think about other things. Yeah, I get it if you don't want to make any plans with me now. But if you're free on Saturday, maybe you can give me another shot. I'll take what I can get. And damn it, this time we have to exchange numbers. Okay. Nothing outside the city center. Okay. [exhales] [gentle music playing] - Hi. - Hi. Thanks. Yeah, Eli's harmonica. Why did it take so long? Oh, did it? Oh. - No uh, I've just been a little busy. - You look… different. - You look good. - Thanks. I don't know. I mean, I guess I'm less stressed lately. [Morten] Okay. - So, uh, you wanna come in? - No, I can't, actually. So… Thanks for this. It's beautiful. The photos of that trip. That was great. - You know? - Mm-hm. - Is Louise not here? - So, um… huh? Louise isn't here? [Morten] Oh, no, uh… That… didn't really work out. - It… - [tsk] Well I... I was thinking, I have an extra ticket to this concert on Saturday if you're not busy. Do you wanna come along? And maybe we could talk about us and… you know, all this. Yeah. I'm actually not free on Saturday. I'm sorry, I'm busy. - Another day, though? - Okay. Well, what are you doing? - A big date? [chuckles] - [nervous chuckle] Well, hug him for me when he wakes up, okay? - Okay. - Bye. [gentle music playing] [sighs] There's something… Something special about Adam. [Liv] Okay. He's, he's so… mature. Damn, that's nice. Damn, I'm so happy for you. Don't forget that what's important is you. Prioritize the pussy. So what are you wearing? Uh, well, I'm wearing like a, uh, a leopard dress. A leopard dress? - [Hanna] With like a T-shirt underneath. - You have a T-shirt underneath? - Hmm. Fashionista. - [Hanna] Yeah, well I, uh… - [doorbell buzzing] - Oh, wait. - I think that's him at the door. - Okay, but prioritize the pussy! - Yeah, yeah, come on. [kissing sounds] - [dogs whimpering] [gentle music continues] Hi. Hey. Uh… [sighs] Hi, sweetie! Hey, shouldn't you be in bed? It's eight o'clock. Yeah, but, uh, he wanted his raincoat. Okay, but, uh… it's not raining now, is it? No, but it was just in case. What's that look? I'll, uh… [sighs] I'll just go get it. [footsteps approaching] - Hi. - Uh, hey. Hey. Uh… So sorry. Morten. Adam. Eli. - Adam. - Hi. Morten. - Adam. - Yeah. - Adam. - Mm. Mm. You still want this? Nah, it's not raining now. Come on, bud. Bye, sweetie. I'm sorry. That maybe was a bit weird. [chuckles] - [exhaling] - Didn't know he was coming. He showed up. - Hey. - [Adam] Hi. Hey. [sighs] [sobbing] Adam's been with his mother in hospice for three days. - He looks all worn out. - [Liv] Shit. It doesn't make me any less horny, you know, but… I mean, shit, should I take the T-shirt off? [Liv] No, take your panties off. Then the T-shirt. Am I allowed to sleep with a guy so fucking sad? - Just take them off. Jesus. - Okay, but… - [door opens] - Oh, wait. He's coming out of the shower. [bathroom door closes] - Hey. - Hey. Can I help you out? No, it's fine. I've got it. - Alright? - Yeah. Go relax on the couch. - I'll be right there. - Okay. [Liv] Go in there, be sexy. Stop the crying, make him horny. Make your pussy happy, Hanna. ["Someone's Dog" by Jelly Crystal playing] ♪ Bad, bad ♪ ♪ That goes alone ♪ [breathing heavily] ♪ And step right down on the ground ♪ [reader on cell phone] Hi!

[cries, groans] [Adam screaming] [sobbing] [whimper] [groans] [groan] [Adam crying] LIV: DID HE MAKE THE PUSSY HAPPY? [Adam] She wasn't exactly a great mother. [sniffles] But I still wanted to give her the chance to become a good grandmother. [sniffles] I know she would have wanted that. I want to become a father. I've felt that way for a long time now. You would make a great dad. [exhales] Yeah. It feels so good to talk to you. I feel like you really can… can understand me. I think we have a lot in common. At times like this, you really feel how short life can be. Mm. It's not good to put stuff off, you know that? No. You're right. A few years ago, I promised myself that I would find someone who likes and understands me to start a family with. That's good. And you are so lovely. [chuckles] You're taking this so well. If you could be a few years younger, it would have been perfect, but children are the deciding factor for me. - What? - Me and my ex did IVF for a long time. I can't go through that again. I hope that we can still be friends? Yeah, yeah. [Adam exhales] Now let's all move into the deep frog. Lift your palms up and we'll be present. And then down. Womb to the floor.

He wanted just some fertile uterus or something. - Yeah. - It's… I mean, I feel fucking stupid. Don't focus on men right now, Hanna. You need to just be focused on yourself and not these fucking dudes. We talked about that. Girl, you know what body part you should be listening to. [phone buzzing] Don't do that. Put it away. It's the middle of class right now. - I actually kind of have to go. - Yeah? Where? [Hanna] I need to go home and see my mom. Sorry. - Call me later. - Yeah. This week's mantra, it's nice when easy, but it's better when it's hard. [playing "It Must Have Been Love" on accordion] Oh! Hanna! [Eli] Hi mommy. [chuckling] Mommy is here. - [Morten] Hey! - Hey. - [Hanna] Hi, sweetie. - [Eva] Mommy. [Hanna] How are you? [Eli] Fine. - What are you guys doing here? - Um, well… Eva and I are just catching up, so… - Hey. So glad that you could make it. - [Hanna] Yeah. [Eli] I need to go to the bathroom. [Eva] You gotta go potty? Yeah, of course. I can take you. - We'll be right back. - [Morten] Okay. You know, I think he misses this. Being a family. I know that I've, uh… hurt you and… upset you. But, uh… I really needed time to think about all this. And, uh… And I think we should do it. Have another baby. And be a family. [giggles] A real family. [both chuckling] For real, Hanna. [Eva] You sit down, Eli. I'm just going to get a refill. - [growl] - Strongest in the world. Come on then! No, not that hard! Ow, ow, ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! [Morten and Eli giggling] - He is a big strong boy. - Mm. Should mommy try now? [Eli] I'm stronger. - I want you to try now. Yeah? - Yeah. [kisses] [gentle music playing] [Staffan] I have some great news. Well, your old job is available. What? Uh-huh. Uh, okay. What about Asrin, though? No, I want you. Yeah. And she's doing a study program in California too so, there's an opening. - Okay. - But really. The main reason, honestly, is that you're the best. And you know it. - Yeah. - Mm-hmm. So you can move over there today. - Yeah. - That's the way it is. [chuckle] Great! Hey wait. Uh… Sorry. Wait. I, uh… I'm actually going to have to… decline. I see. But, uh, I mean, uh… - Is that bastard still making... - No! I mean, I'm just so tired of being good. I just wanna be like, you know, just sort of like, mediocre. Like Ola, kind of. Hand in half-assed reports and go home early and just feel perfectly happy with all of that. - Guy-sufficient. That's what I want. - Okay but, uh… The thing is, you have such an enormous potential. No. I need to be able to live a little outside of this. - This is some oppor... - Do you want me to stay on? Then I wanna be at his level. Huh? If that's what you want, then we'll, we will find a way. We'll make it work. Okay. - What do you think, Ola? - Yeah. That's fine, or, uh… Sorry about that. It was positive like in a good way. - It wasn't… - Yeah. She meant that in a good way, obviously. - Obviously. - [Hanna] Exactly. - It's decided. - So can I work over there now? Yeah, yeah. [exhales] SURROUNDED BY BAD BOSSES THE RASPBERRY CAVE Hanna. - Hi. - Hey. I just wanted to say, it feels dang great that you're back. Oh? I mean, I do like Asrin, but she was so quick all the time. Just… [exhales] Uh, she had a hand cream, too, that was so strong. I mean I got this crazy rash like all over my chin. I had a bit of an allergy to it. Did she rub your chin? No, I don't think so. I think that… I think she must have used my keyboard at some point, and then I used it, and probably touched my face. - Oh, no. - I just wanted to say it's great as heck. Uh, with the old… team back and everything. [chuckle] [gentle music playing] - [Eli] Hi, mommy. - Hi, sweetie. [Morten] Hey! Hey! Mm… [kiss] How are you? - Hi. - Hi. [sighs] - So did you get up late or what? - It was just a couple of minutes. - [chuckle] - Come on. Let's check out the animals. - [Morten] Come on, sweetie. - [Hanna] Are you excited? - [Eli] Yeah. - [Hanna] Come on. Let's go have a look. They have a ton of birds here. - [Morten] Hey. - [gasps] [Hanna] Look, have you seen the wolves? Eli! Look! There! - [Eli] Wow. - [Morten] Do you see the arctic fox? [Hanna] Isn't that a lynx? - Yeah. - [Eli] Wow, look at that. It looks like you when you get your tenth parking ticket in a week. [gasps] [chuckle] Listen I... I... I really do want this. But we're, um, going back to where we started. Yeah.. And you were right. [sighs] I have prioritized wrong. I have lived according to other people's expectations and I've not listened to myself. - Is baseball hat guy the reason? - Mm. No. It's his mom, it's just... It's just... No, it's not about him at all. This is about me. I don't know, I… I need to be able to be who I am and... If you can't handle that then... then that's okay. Prioritize the pussy. Okay.
