This could've happened just yesterday But it happened a long time ago. So long that names of the characters and dates have been forgotten. Also in oblivion is the name of the place where what happened happened. But there is no doubt that the facts are true. That's what the person who told me the story told me. Someone of great reputation and even better memory. This person heard the story from his great-grandfathers and these from their great-great-grandfathers. People that never knew how to tell a lie. Not a single lie. Well then Once upon a time there was a happy island surrounded by a serene and blue sea and covered by a serene and blue sky. And every day of the week... Samana! Wake up, it's late! Rosa [unintelligible] Agustiana! Throw yourself down from the hammock now! Caridad! Go get me some water, I'm so thirsty I'm drying! Soledad Pass me the goad that I must go. Mmmmodesta! Oh! But Sunday! Sunday was different. Modesta! What is it, Love. "Love", my ass! Ow! Mari My body is killing me! I can't move with this belly. Ugh! Don't make a fuss and get up. Always complaining. Always with their stories and songs. Look Mommy, Pedrito broke my doll! Lies Mommy, I didn't break anything. Shut up! Why don't you take care of these kids for once. Quiet, Daddy is angry and might scold you So go play there. OK? Well, I'm going. Mari, won't you wait for the coffee? Ugh. Tired of waiting for it. Besides I have some important things to do and I'm running late. One more thing. Prepare that chicken that's running around and make a stew for when I come back. Well, now you know. What is it? My little precious. You want your milk? Uh? Your milk? Want to go for a walk? My precious. Come with mommy. Let's prepare your milk. Let me see if the chicken is there. Where the hell is that chicken. Uh-huh!, there it is. Hey Severo, what did you do with the chicken from the other day? Can't do nothing with it, I left it at home for my woman to cook it for when I come back. Hi comadre, how are you? So so, as usual. With these men that have no compassion for one. This morning he didn’t drink the coffee because he was in a rush. Then told me to kill a chicken to cook for lunch. But look at this belly of mine I can't do nothing, I went to catch it and it flew away. So I cooked some cassava, he'll have to settle for that. Ha, men are all the same they think one has nothing to do in the house. And we have to put up with this since waking up till going to sleep. Ha! yeah. There they come. I'm off comadre my house is alone, and mine is surely coming too. -Bye comadre -Bye comadre Well Negra, is the chicken I told you too cook ready? We are so hungry we could eat a cow. So, is it ready? It's not ready yet because... What are you saying? Is not ready cause... as you told me, I went to catch the chicken but it flew away and I couldn't catch it And with my belly I can't run around What kind of woman is this this that tells me she can't catch the sad little chicken because of the belly? Looking for excuses for not doing the work. Women make up stuff so they don't have to do the things we tell them to. Women are useless. They are only good for that, for breeding. Don't you dare to come here with a sandal, or else I'll beat you Look, now your big belly is not a bother, right? Leave you scumbag!, I'm tired of you and your mistreatment! Good afternoon! We heard about the stick! Ha ha! The stick you hit your husband with. Look, there they come too. The stick, yeah! ♪A woman in my life♪ ♪is committed to destroying me♪ ♪God will punish her♪ ♪For her malice, before I die♪ ♪She answers with disaffection♪ ♪Any favor I do to her♪ ♪Oh heartless woman♪ ♪Evil is punished just as good♪ ♪I almost can't sleep at night♪ ♪Thinking what could be the cause♪ ♪And as I can't find any♪ ♪Only revenge comes to mind♪ ♪A woman in my life♪ ♪is committed to destroying me♪ ♪God will punish her♪ ♪For her malice, before I die♪ IF YOU DRINK TO FORGET, PAY BEFORE DRINKING Thanks comrades Thank you very much I feel very happy to have been elected president of our LWL Association Liberated Women's League And following the resolution by our comrade Emeteria We will use this wood stick as a symbol. Since we've given our first step towards emancipation We must become the watch women for the defense of our rights. Therefore we must unite our efforts for that purpose Yeah! Hey Modesta. It think the first thing to do is to make a law so that our rights are protected That's what we'll do. Go girl, get some pen and paper. I propose that no man has the right to beat his wife. Unless it's necessary! You keep it and prepare, you're gonna write. I think our comrade Caridad has just said something very good. I've said that since we are not our husband's slaves we need more cooperation in the household duties. They're all the same Mine once had me a full month with a bump bigger than a anvil Women? Uh! That's was Adam's biggest mistake. Sadly, with them is bad, but without them is worse. Well, I believe they also have the right to enjoy life. You know, even animals get tired of it, how are they not going to get tired too? I don't know but things aren't the same anymore. Guys, the thing is, sometimes we cross the line. Come on, tell him! What's the matter, a cat got your tongue? Don't be afraid, we are here! Well, misters. We've been talking about our problems as housewives And...uh Come on Woman, say it already What the hell is going on with all of you? Well, we've decided that we also have rights as mothers and wives So we've all agreed to place some conditions on you First that since we are not slaves we demand more participation from the husbands in the matters of the household and marriage. Second that the husbands have no right to beat their wives. Third that the husbands have responsibilities in taking care and educating the children. Ha, including changing and washing their underpants? And why not? You didn't have your underpants washed when you were little? Well...uh...this is getting ugly. Fourth Oh God! There's more? That the man, as long as they can, must do the heavy work in the house, such as carrying water and chopping wood. Therefore it is just to demand that men become more tolerant and understanding in all matters that are important to the peace and happiness in the household. Also, we want to state that we're not rebelling against our responsibilities as mothers and wives what we ask is fair treatment the same thing that men are always asking, we are asking it now for us. Fair treatment in the household work and fairness in the relationship between husband and wive. That is all. Well. What do you say? Let's talk about it. Quiet, they must not listen It's better if... Written too. Wait a moment, I'll get a paper. He'll get a paper for us to write. We say what we demand and... There he comes. Let's start the same way as them Solutions as well, what do you think? That's what we should do... Write everything We agree about the fair treatment to women. Well... We've decided that this matter is of the utmost importance and can't be solved so quickly We've decided to leave it for tomorrow. Today has been too much. Besides, we're hungry and we want to rest, we'll talk tomorrow. No no, right now! No sir, you want to fool us! If we wait till tomorrow we're back to square one. We're also hungry and tired! But there is a saying that goes: "Never leave that till tomorrow which you can do today" So, no dinner! We won't move till this issue is addressed. Moreover, we will sit here. Severo, let's meet again. OK, let's go. What a drag. It looks like you've decided something. Here we are to tell you what we've agreed. The thing is... well... thing is... we've decided to accept in part your petitions. Hold on! Hold on! But... But, we also have some clarifications to make, and some conditions. First we recognize the right of women to a fair treatment We recognize that often we husbands forget to consider and understand our women better. Second we accept, that a man should not beat his wife but a woman also must not beat her husband. So man, as well as woman must now forget about the "stick law". Third we recognize that women have a high burden with the house and the children but women must also accept that we work as animals for the family's livelihood. Fourth we're willing to be better fathers, being more concerned about the children's education and care but we're not willing to wash underpants. It's out of the question! Fifth and last we recognize the right of woman to ask us to make them happy but since we also want to be happy we tell you please, more caressing and less talking That is all And this is how the story that I was told ends. The story that happened during a time in which man and women didn't understand each other well. Today, thanks to civilization things don't happen this way. Man treat women very, very well And women, clearly don't use wood sticks to convince their husbands anymore They don't, right? THE END
