My mother raised me, but didn't choose my in-laws well... Mama, you hurt me... Mama, you hurt me... The clear river water flows without end... My lover is forever in my heart, in my heart... I choose the seeds from among a half pint of soybeans... My mother raised me, but didn't choose my in-laws well... Mama, you hurt me... Mama, Mama, you hurt me, you hurt me... Director: Xie Jin Sister Hibiscus... add a little more hot pepper to my bowl! - I want vinegar in mine! - Coming up! Sister Hibiscus, give me some more green onion, hurry! - Guigui... - Hurry up... Sister Hibiscus, I've been waiting all day, hurry! Coming right up! - Did you add more hot pepper? - Of course... It's so hot your belly button will catch fire... If my belly button catches fire, you have to come put it out! Hey miss, one bowl of rice tofu, with extra soup! It's hot today, so I'll give you a bowl of kun soup... Whoa, Sister Hibiscus' hands are whiter than the rice tofu! You pig! Your wife must have not have punished you lately by pulling your ears... My ears have been waiting for you to pull them... Go ahead, have a tug... Get out of here, you brute! Big Momma's here? Come sit here... Make room, make room... Are you well? Business has been great lately, eh? - Yeah... Yours has extra peppers - Oh, great... - Leaving? Take care... - See you next time... Hi, Sister Mangeng... - Hi, Secretary Li... - Pick a big one... Brother Mangeng is here... Eh, Secretary Li is here? Eating tofu, eh? Have a seat... - You want a bowl? - Yeah, I'll have a bowl... - Sister Hibiscus, bring me a bowl, too! - Yeah, I heard you... - Sister Hibiscus, here's the money... - I'll collect it for you... Yuyin, how much have you made today? Mom! Keep going! - Sister Hibiscus, hand me another bowl... - Here you go! Wang Qiushe, are you up yet? Coming... Have you publicized tonight's meeting? I'll do it right away... - What do you think you're doing? - Where's Director Li? You think Director Li is in the pot? I've got some important town business to announce. If I'm delayed, it'll be on you! Ha, you think your bullshit duties are so important? Even at the government shops an official like me can't get a cup of hot water... Don't touch! The world has taken a turn for the worst! You'd think the people in this town had never had rice tofu before! What do you know? Look closer... Those men are acting like hungry cats circling a dead fish! Director, we should set up a food stall. We'd definitely make money, you think? Nonsense! We're a state-run business. Our salary is dependable, but theirs? Director Li, there's a town meeting with the cadres tonight... I know, I know... The "Four Freedoms" policy is getting abused more and more... Old Gu, what are you busy with now? - Nothing! - I'd like a word with you... You want to get dibs on grain again? With such fine grain, you should be able to cook up some pretty decent meals... Whenever the grain distribution director opens his mouth, its about grain... The shop got some Wuling Yeast Liquor, I want to give you two bottles special... Come on, let me fry up a couple dishes for you... Forget about it, people say your state-run shop serves up mouse shit in everything! Watch your mouth! Would I give you mouse shit? Why don't you let me wash the collar of your jacket then? Old Gu, in the cities now everybody is wearing fake collars... OK, that's enough... Old Gu, show up a little early to tonight's meeting! One bowl, please! Fuck off! - Hi, Director Gu! - Hi! I'm here... Guigui, Director Gu is here! - Old Gu is here... - Hey Mangeng... Hey, Director Gu, have a smoke... Qiushe, you're not paying again? Look at Qin Shutian, he eats, pays, and still lends a hand... But you're just a freeloader! This piece of land is still under my name... If I sold it to Hu Yuyin... ...it'd be worth at least two or three thousand bowls of rice tofu! You cheapskate! He's always looking for a handout, what a bum! Using his position to get the good stuff, and still not paying! - That would be wonderful... - Do you have a permit? - Oh, Sister Official, do you want to eat... - Business permit! What's the matter? We're a small stall that pays our taxes... Business permit! Everybody and their kids know me... I'm here to check your permit! If you don't have one, my staff will requisition your stall! Another bowl... another bowl! Hey, shouldn't you say something? OK OK, forget about it! We're all fellow townsfolk, and see each other all the time! If there's a problem, go to the municipal tax office to sort it out! - Sister Hibiscus makes delicious rice tofu! - That's right! Guoxiang, there's a cadre meeting tonight, were you notified? You assume I don't know anything because I'm not a local... - Give me another bowl! - She should feel dumb... Uncle... - Crazy Qin! - Here, here... Tell your fellow Five Categories Elements to gather in the town square after supper! - OK, right away... - Why is there so much smoke? - I just had my lunch... - Give me one! - Um, this is my last one... - Hurry up and tell them! Attention Brigade Cadres... Here on the border of three districts, your situation is complicated... Many farmers have abandoned the communes to do trading instead... ...which wreaks havoc on the local markets... ...and sabotages the collective economy of the People's Communes. Rice Tofu Queen: Hu Yuyin Colluders: Li Mangeng & Gu Yanshan For us cadres, how do we deal with this problem? Even though Hibiscus Town hasn't been touched by many political campaigns... The County Party Committee has handed down its strictest resolution yet! Guoxiang, you've been in Hibiscus Town for some time now... Do you have any plans to marry? Not a single one of the men here meet my standards... Secretary Li, they are all assembled! - Crazy Qin! - Here! Let's hurry it up! Everyone at attention! Sir, the Five Categories Elements of Hibiscus Town have finished assembling! - Everyone is here? - Yes, Sir! - Rollcall! - Yes, Sir! The Rightist Qin Shutian?... Here! - The Landlord Zhang Hongde? - Here! - The Landlord Zhang Yaozhong? - Here! - The Bad Element Tian Zhifen? - Here! - The Rich Peasant Liu Deqi? - Here! - The Anti-revolutionary Wang Jincheng? - Here! - The Rich Peasant... Li Fugui? - Here! What's with Li Fugui? Sir, the Rich Peasant Li Fugui... ...suddenly began coughing blood uncontrollably at 3:29 this afternoon... Since he could not be here himself, his grandson is here to replace him... ...and can pass on any further instructions! Ai, such wickedness! Is this class struggle? Hmph! I guess now it has to be passed on to three generations... Everyone go back to work, act conscientiously, and don't make trouble... - Dismissed! - Let's go! Everyone back to work! - Crazy Qin! - Here! Do you have supplies leftover for painting slogans? Sir, I still have some... Paint another slogan on that wall over there. Write... I'lll have a look at some reports... Wait a bit and come by to transcribe it. Yes, Sir! Sir, should today's slogan be painted in Song-style font, or another kind? Whatever you used last time will be fine. Yes, Sir... I guarantee completion of this task! Never forget... ...class struggle! How's it look? Director Gu... Wang Qiushe agreed to sell this part of his land to us... - We want to build a small house here... - Oh... Use this to clean your face... - OK, then... - Take care... Uncle, why was my request to transfer denied? You're the County Party Secretary, can't you help it along? Your transfer order is coming down soon... You are to become Section Chief for the County Commerce Department. - Wow, great! - Have some tea! - Eat some candy, give some to the child! - This house is so bright and merry! After we finish taking down the old house, Guigui and I want to adopt a child... We will call on you for the brigade's support at that time... OK, I'll support you... Director Gu, when the time comes, will you be the child's godfather? Me, godfather? The one who sells you rice chaff? People will talk... Ha ha, I'm just joking, of course I'll be godfather... We'll all prosper! Hey, Li... Manager Li... I mean, Section Chief Li... You've been gone for more than a year, eh? After you get settled, I want to apply for Branch Secretary... - You're Wang Qiushe, right? - Yes... - Wang was a Land Reform activist... - Hi, Old Wang! We'll be coming to your house soon... Huh? My place is a filthy wreck, you don't want to see that... We're looking for someone who has borne a heavy resentment... Take care, watch your step! You officials are really tireless... Comrades, it's already been 14 or 15 years since liberation... Yet Land Reform activists like Wang Qiushe... ...have not yet been fully emancipated! How do we solve this problem? If we don't seize class struggle and launch movements, what else can we do? What's going on in the town? Oh, Hu Yuyin is celebrating her new house, its really lively... They have wine and meat, we should go. Chief Li, let's go over there! Hu Yuyin? The one who sells rice tofu? That's her. If I didn't run into you, I would have already gone over there... - Come on, drink up! Give her a full cup! - It's a special occasion! Drink it dry! - Come help me drink this! - OK, I'll help her drink! Open wide and drink it down! - Punish her by making her sing! - Make a speech! I'm no good at speaking... But I'll bow before all of you! Hey, over here! Bow for us, too! OK, over here! Brother Mangeng, help me! OK, OK! Let's ask Old Gu to say a few words... Never forget class struggle! The rich get richer, and the poor get poorer... That's the cause of this polarization we have in the villages... - Comrades, our task here is momentous! - Yes... Qiushe, why didn't you come over and drink yesterday? The rich get richer, the poor get poorer... It's time for a movement... Chief Li, is this movement going to be like during Land Reform? Right, like a second land reform? A second land reform? Should we redraw the class lines? Correct, we are overhauling the class ranks and alignments... ...to make a clear demarcation between left, right and center! Old Wang, you've got quite a few ideas, eh? That's good... Are we going to split up everybody's property and wealth? - Something like that... - Now this is a movement I can support! Old Wang, you are from this place, so tell us... Which cadres in this town are reactionary? And who are the newly rich? Townsfolk Add to the Glory of the People's Commune The Hardworking Couple Receives the Bounties of Socialism Is Hu Yuyin here? Here! Oh, Section Chief Li... I heard you had returned, but I haven't had any time to come by to see you... Come in and have a seat... Guigui! Section Chief Li is here, get some tea ready! - Come in, sit here... - That's OK, I can do it... Go boil some more water... Have some melon seeds... He's still so shy... I should have come here earlier... I came here on behalf of the Work Section to have a look at your new place here... There are a couple matters I'd like to discuss with you... - Have a seat... - Yes... - No market day today? - No... Our County Work Section Committee is in town, you must have heard? We're launching a movement... We're inquiring into each household's political and economic situation... You need to be completely honest with the Work Section, just as with the Party... Do you understand what I mean? - Have some water... - Yes... I have here the basic information of your accounts... Have a look to make sure they are correct... Every market day you sell approximately 500 bowls of rice tofu... And take in about 50 yuan... There's six market days a month, so you make about 300 yuan in that time... About 100 is deducted from the net, which leaves 200 yuan... Hu Yuyin... Your income is the same as what a upper-level provincial official makes! We're just a small enterprise... Usually we pass the days in such a muddle, we've never added it up... Section Chief Li, we have a business permit! I never said for certain you broke the law or exploited anyone... OK, we'll leave it here for now... This house is built on land... ...given to the peasant Wang Qiushe during Land Reform, right? And these matching couplets hanging by your door... ...were written by the reactionary Rightist Qin Shutian, right? There's also... ...the matter of Grain Distribution Director Gu Yanshan... ...giving you 60 pounds of white rice every market day... B- b-but... That can't be considered white rice, it's just powdered rice chaff... A lot of Work Units and families alike buy it to feed their pigs... Other people feed it to their pigs that are then sold to the state... But you? Your powdered rice chaff... ...is turned into a commodity to fatten yourself, right? In total, Grain Distribution Manager Gu Yanshan sold you... 11,880 pounds of white rice! What? No! Section Chief Li... That's correct? Isn't it? Don't be nervous! I'm just trying to get to the bottom of this... I've got things to do, so I can't stay any longer... The reports from the provincial, county, and municipal Party Committees... The reports from the provincial, county, and municipal Party Committees... ...on class struggle in the Four Cleanups Movement are now concluded... We now move to the second item on the meeting agenda... Is the Capitalist Rightist Qin Shutian present? Here! Come up here! Get up there! Stand here! This here is... Hibiscus Town's own, the famous Qin Shutian... - Also known as Crazy Qin! - Yes, yes, that's me... - Be serious! Stand still! - Yes, sir... Looking at this class enemy, do you really feel hate for him? I especially want to ask the Party Cadres present here... Do you consider Qin Shutian ... fragrant... or foul? This man made a name for himself in 1957... ...collecting folksongs and rewriting them into antifeudal plays... Then he launched a ferocious attack on socialism and the Party... He is a Rightist who has committed grave criminal acts... ...and was sent back to his hometown to reform himself through labor... But the strange thing about this class enemy is... ...he actually possesses authority over the entire town's propaganda program! On the streets, on the walls, in the market... All those revolutionary slogans come from the brush of this reactionary Rightist! Qin Shutian, tell us... These glorious and privleged tasks... who delegated them to you? Glorious tasks? Privleged tasks? Crazy Qin, speak honestly! It was... um... Oh, it was the superiors, the superiors... Look at your stammering! You're hiding the truth! - Step down! - Go! There are cadres among us... who cannot tell friend from enemy... They have forfeited their class standing! We want to ask those cadres... On which side are you going to put your ass? Huh? Comrades, low and middle-class peasant comrades... It gets even stranger... Not long ago there was a small food stall vendor that erected a brand-new house... Some people have noticed... ...that compared to the two biggest stores in town before the Liberation... ...theirs is even grander! Speaking of which... In the past 2 years and 9 months, this small food stall vendor... ...has accumulated an income of 6,600 yuan! Six thousand six hundred! Some of our own cadres have supported her on this road toward capitalism! Quiet down! Everyone quiet down! Quiet quiet quiet! Time to visit the toilet! We need to think of a way to get rid of the new house... No matter if we have to sell it for only a couple hundred kuai... Who has fated us to live in this tumbledown shack? Nonsense! You spineless good-for-nothing! From morning til night, we work ourselves to death... Wearing down the pot handle to a nub, til it has a hole in the bottom... Who are we exploiting? What crime have we committed? And you're already talking about selling the house! Yuyin... I was just thinking out loud... Our family affairs... are still yours to decide... Whatever you think, we'll do... Oh my heavens! You stupid thing... You don't even know to say something when you're hurt? Yuyin... With you by my side, I'm not afraid of anything! Even if I have to beg for food, I'm not afraid! Yuyin, don't think I have the courage of a mouse... To keep our new house... ...I'll even kill someone if you tell me to! Do you have a death wish? Don't talk such crazy foolishness! Listen to what have to tell you... There really isn't any way out of this! Oh you... We could sell the new house, or we could fight them to the death... But look how scared you are after just having a meeting tonight... If something more serious happens in the days to come, how could you bear it? All they can do is kill me! You! Hey Branch Secretary... Tonight half of what that County Section Chief said was meant to attack you... I'm not sure if you were clever enough to pick up on that... She's wondering just what you and your tofu-peddling "sister" are up to... Did you throw away your class postion for that Crazy Qin? The woman Section Chief came this close to saying your name... That tofu woman doesn't act like she's single or married... How about you stop your mouth from farting? You?! I've had quite enough of the stink in the air tonight! Don't try to act like a hero now in front of me! If you got the ability, why don't you throw your weight around out there? - You itching for a beating, eh? - What can you do? - You bitch! I didn't even hit you! - Serves you right! - Bitch! I'm not through with you! - You try it! You're the one who put your ass on that side... Hey! Come over here... We can't keep this 1500 kuai here... I'll see if I can give it to Brother Mangeng to hold it for us... If we keep it here, it will only cause trouble... Mangeng? Did you not hear that woman Section Chief? She was attacking him... Don't be scared... He's in the Party, and he is a veteran... What can she do to him? Besides... he's my sworn brother. OK... Yuyin... I think you'd better go away until this blows over... I've got some distant relatives in Guangxi... Be quiet! Brother Mangeng, help us... Fifth Sister... You are all Five Categories Elements... Targets of the dictatorship of the proletariat... Be conscientious, and don't make trouble... This week you should think about how you can improve... Then come back next week to make your reports, understand? Yes, Sir! What are you looking at, huh? Hmph, look at her! Hey! Hey... What are you doing, huh? Listen up, you'd better not see that Sister Hibiscus so much... The day will come when she'll make a criminal of you! Are you finished? Eating, sleeping, these are the important things... These days will pass... Movements! Movements... Movements are just temporary... What the hell do you know about it? Sleep, sleep... Quit smoking out the mosquitos... The life of a mosquito is not easy, either... Aiyo, what's the matter with you? Tell me what's on your mind... - You know... Yuyin is my sworn sister... - You mean? Hmph! She and Guigui are honest folk... You heard Li Guoxiang's implications... They are targets of this campaign. Hu Yuyin is still holding onto 1500 kuai... How do you know about your sworn sister's secret money? She's afraid it will be confiscated... - What does that have to with us? Hmph! - Hey, listen to me... After the meeting Hu Yuyin entrusted that 1500 kuai to me... ...and asked me to hide it for her. Did you take it? Where did you put it? Upstairs in the regular place... Oh great! You're just going to let disaster into this house! Ruin has struck this family! You're such an ingrate! I've always treated you well! - You're completely taken in by that vixen! - What are you shouting for? Stop wailing! Then explain things to me clearly... Just what kind of relationship is there between you and that fox spirit? Am I your wife, or is she? I'm gonna beat that stinking mouth of yours! Quit spewing such rubbish! Fine! Hit me! Go ahead! I've given you three daughters, and you want to get rid of me, right? You wanted to ditch me long ago... Mine can't compare with her fresh, white skin! You ingrate! Hit me! Beat me to death and be done with me! Go be with your fresh wife! You heard what that woman Section Chief said at the meeting... You could go down! You don't want this family anymore, right? You still want to bring your sweetheart's illicit money here, you ingrate... Fine, you want to drag me and the kids down with you when you drown... Make me your scapegoat to go sit in a prison cell! That's not going to happen! - What are you doing? - Don't mind me! You can't stop me! If you don't turn it in... If you don't... I will... - Where are going to go? - If you turn it in, if you won't, I'll do it... Turn it in? Turn it in? Give it back! You won't do it, will you? If you don't, I'll report it to the Work Section Chief! You wouldn't dare! You bitch! Like a dog on the fucking street, I'll beat you to death! Anay, I don't want to fucking live anymore, I... Mangeng! Mangeng! Mangeng! I'm begging you! Mangeng! If you won't do it for my sake, think about your three daughters! You need to turn that money in, Mangeng... I'm begging you... Oh god... Nowadays unless you trample on others, they'll trample on you! I can't take it! My sister was born with skin like white silver... Her melon seed-shaped face is loved to death... Oh, loved to death... As she walks down the road, they all fall in love... When she sits at home, they all come over... Oh, they all come over... You need to consider this very seriously... Either you keep your Party membership... Or you take that girl who opened a food stall as your wife... My sister was born with skin like white silver... Her melon seed-shaped face is loved to death... Oh, loved to death... As she walks down the road, they all fall in love... When she sits at home, they all come over... Oh, they all come over... Old Gu! How is your thinking coming along? You will be suspended from your position and must confess your crime... This is the decision of the County Party Committee and the County Grain Bureau... You're an old comrade... I used to respect you so deeply... I never thought the problem could be this serious... It's very possible that you will be made an example of in this campaign... Hmph! No matter how serious the problem, as long as you come clean to the Party... ...it shouldn't be difficult to resolve... As for me... I have no prejudice against Hibiscus Town... Nor do I have any prejudice against you... You see... I made a point of talking to you alone today... ...with no other comrades present... Gu Yanshan... I've got some numbers I want you to listen to... According to our examination of your accounts... Since the second half of 1961, over the next two years and nine months... You sold to that New Bourgeois Element Hu Yuyin a total of... 11,880 pounds of white rice... Is this accurate? More than ten thousand pounds? Not a small amount... That was just powdered rice chaff, not rice from the state storehouse! No matter if it was powdered rice chaff or white rice... As Grain Distribution Director you issued more than ten thousand pounds, right? - When did you go work in the paddies? - Hey... If it wasn't the state storehouse where did it come from? Didn't you make the report to the Bureau? Who gave you so much authority? It wasn't just her I sold to... It's all in the official accounts! - I didn't profit one extra cent! - It was that clean, huh? You didn't profit one extra cent... This I can perhaps believe... However... a bachelor like yourself... ...should at least make a bachelor's profit... What bachelor's profit? Don't act so naive... What cat doesn't want to eat raw fish? That rice tofu beauty... she's the Xi Shi of Hibiscus Town! You!? You mean to say... I had relations with her? Wouldn't this kind of thing be right up her alley? Wasn't her mother a prostitute? Section Chief Li... How could I have had relations with her? How could I have? How could I have? Me? Me? Li Guoxiang! You! You... you... Go tell your Work Team to all come in here! I... I'll face all of you! I'll take my pants off for you to see! Gu Yanshan! What kind of pervert are you? You dirty old bachelor... Now you want to take off your pants? Fine! I'll allow this! I'll convene a meeting of the whole village for you! You can face the whole crowd and take your pants off! I... You have forced me to this! You... you... I was wounded in the war! You... I'm impotent... I'm impotent... Old Gu... Sit... Have a seat... You and Hu Yuyin may not have carried on an affair... But Li Mangeng isn't impotent, is he? They have passionately sworn loyalty to each other, ever wonder why that is? You... Hu Yuyin... Li Mangeng ... and that Qin Shutian... Economically, politically, ideologically... You want me to ignore the countless links between you all? Your little group here... Collaborating both within and outside the Party! You're running the whole politcs and economy of Hibiscus Town! It's become a counter-ideology! What? Actually, it is a... ...a clique! A clique? What are you doing? Just a cough... it itches... You still want to kill the Work Unit Chief? Where is that young girl from? She's married to my relative, she's just visiting... What class is her family? Low, definitely low... Does she have papers from her commune or work unit? Did you... for her... have her residency transferred? She's a relative, what papers does she need just to visit? Well... without papers she cannot stay here for very long, OK? Exhibition of Class Education in Hibiscus Town Posted by the Work Unit of Hibiscus Town May, 196 Uncle! Aiya, you're back looking for Old Gu? He got caught up in their investigation of you and now he's locked up! Sister, sister... Is Brother Mangeng home? I'm begging you, don't come here looking for him again... You've brought trouble on him... and trouble on this home! The bosses sent him to the county seat for self-criticism and reeducation... He left with just his bedding roll... What about my husband?

You've already been labelled as a New Rich Peasant... I'm the wife of a Rich Peasant? A tofu peddler is the wife of a New Rich Peasant? Qin... This is all your fault! When I was married... ...you came with those raunchy songs of yours! You spoiled our good fortune! The candles are lit... and the grass is green... The girl by my side... sings a few verses... She sings her grief... and her heart shudders... Her eyes are piercing... their waters run deep... Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Resolutely Attack the New Rich Peasant Hu Yuyin!

All the ox ghosts and snake spirits together! Look, they're still not coming clean... I'm not a Five Categories Element or Ox Ghost and Snake Sprit! - I've never ever been a Rightist! - Come clean! Revolutionary little generals! Comrades! I was a Party Committee member! A Commune Secretary... What kind of trash are you talking! Give me that! I always worked to carry out campaigns in Hibiscus Town to their success! What? You mean the campaigns that happened in your bed with all those men? I... I'm a Leftist, a Leftist... Have a seat inside, sit and rest a bit... A Leftist... Branch Secretary Wang... The Great Cultural Revolution has blown the lid off Hibiscus Town... In the future it will belong to you lower and middle-class peasants... I was a hired farmhand... In the old society, we hired farmhands were the most exploited by capitalism... What? Capitalism? Before liberation, China hadn't yet reached the capitalist stage... They're all reactionaries, and they were all oppressing me! That's all I know... Hey, the rain stopped! - Chief, shouldn't we get going? - Let's go... - You want to change clothes first? - No need... Hey, Li Guoxiang! For the time being you are part of the Rich Peasant Wife Hu Yuyin's work unit... Be diligent! Carry out the campaign! This you know how to do... Crazy!

Branch Secretary Wang! - Branch Secretary Wang! - Come in... What did you need to see me about? Those Red Guards from Beijing told me to read this paper... It's about the situation with the campaign... This is information about the overthrow of Liu Shaoqi... Paint a large slogan... Write... "Overthrow Li Guoxiang"! She's done for after this... She relied on her uncle in the county office... ...to get her appointment as Chair of the People's Commune! You think I did the same to get to be Branch Secretary? Hard to say... You are a good guy... You turned in that 1500 kuai of Hu Yuyin's and secured your Party membership... Look at Gu Yanshan, just a washed-up drunk now... This clerk's position of yours... You've been at it for two years now? Movements, campaigns... you don't understand these... Movements are great... In the future when I'm a County Committee Secretary... I'll promote you to the town's Branch Secretary! And when I come around on an inspection, don't try to fool me! I know what's good to eat in this town and what it's specialties are... Believe me, I know it well! Time to get up... OK, let me do the sweeping... Clerk Li, what instructions do you have now? Branch Secretary Wang is back! So he's back... I thought you were going to announce we couldn't buy liquor... Huh? We can't buy liquor? That's right, no more liquor sales...
