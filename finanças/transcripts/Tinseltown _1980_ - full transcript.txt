New York, the Big Apple. Lots of bustle and lots of people. They say there are eight million stories in the naked city. Well, this isn't one of them. This story is about Hollywood, California. Tinseltown USA. Well, let me tell you a story. It's about three girls I met at a party once. It's also about what this town can do to a woman. Tell me. I'm tougher than I look. And besides, I'm here to be a reporter, not an actress. It's funny you should say that. Two of the girls came here to be actresses. The other one, well, let me start at the beginning. The first one's name was Mary Jo Harmon. The only word to describe her was sweet. She was a farm girl, came from some hick town in middle America. Good, middle-class family, brought up to believe in all the old-fashioned virtues like honesty, thrift, loyalty. Big girl, farm fed, natural blue eyes and built like a brick outhouse. She was a normal, healthy American girl. And from what I understand, she didn't mind spending some time in bed with her normal, everyday boyfriend. She welcomed it. She had a dream about becoming a movie star. The second one's name was Dominique Allwin. That wasn't the name she was born with. Most of the girls in her business used more glamorous names. She was somewhat more sophisticated than Mary Jo. She came from New York, or at least she lived there long enough to consider herself a New Yorker. She didn't share Mary Jo's dream. In fact, Dominique wasn't much of a dreamer. She was very happy just the way she was, thank you. I also have it on good authority that Dominique was one hell of a piece in bed. And one of the top people in her line of work. Oh come on, Mary Jo. Settle, Billy. - It could take forever for you to become a big star, and I don't wanna wait that long for us to get married. So why don't you just stay here and help me down on the farm? That's all you really know how to do anyway. - You don't think that I've got what it takes? - Oh, come on, baby, of course I do. But what about acting? And what do you know about getting started in Hollywood? You know that's a big city, ain't at all like Wetonka. Besides, there's a lotta good looking me out there. You might meet someone else that you like, and you ain't never gonna come back to me. Silly. I won't even look at another man while I'm gone. After all, we're engaged, aren't we? - Yeah, but I hear women have to some pretty funny things to get jobs out there. I heard about the casting couch and all that. - Those are just stories, don't worry about me, Billy. I'll come back a star. - Thank you for a lovely evening, Dominique. My pleasure. - I'll have the usual amount transferred to your account, hon. That'll be fine. - It's a pleasure doing business with you. Same time next week? Oh, I'm sorry. I'll be in Los Angeles next week. How about the week after? Yeah, okay, fine. Okay, bye-bye. Bye, hon, take care. You too. - The last girl was named Pat Norman. Shoulda been Pat Normal. She was a local girl, raised right here in LA. A freshman at UCLA studying drama. She did share Mary Jo's dream. She too wanted to be a movie star. - It really upsets you, doesn't it? You waited 30 years to find the right girl to withdraw from. You know what your problem is? The only woman you really ever loved was your mother. That was very good, Pam. Thanks. - You need to work on your enunciation a little better, but I think you're really getting the hang of it. - Unlike a lotta girls in Nowheresville, once Mary Jo made up her mind to go to Hollywood, she kissed her boyfriend goodbye and caught a bus headed west. So it was goodbye, Oklahoma, and hello, Hollywood and stardom. There's a broken heart for every light on Old Broadway. There's a busted cherry for ever star on the sidewalk outside. I know what I'm talking about. I've worked the Hollywood beat for a lot of years. And I've seen them come and seen them go, mostly come. Of course, in real life, nobody comes to Hollywood and becomes a star right away. Hardly anyone even finds work. And in Hollywood, if you wanna meet someone who can introduce you to someone who knows someone who can help you, you need an agent. Hi, I'm an actress. - I'm sorry, we're not taking any resumes right now. Oh, okay, thank you. - Some agents are better than others, more honest, harder working, harder to talk to. Morty Green is easy to get to see. You just have to remember to wash your hands when you leave. What do you want? Uh, I'm an actress. Oh yeah, you and my aunt Tillie. Got any credits? - Well I did the lead in East Lynn back home. East Lynn? Jesus. All right, come on in, I'll take a look at you. Turn around. No, no, put the bag down first. Now turn around. Try and make you look a little glamorous. Stick your chest out. Suck your stomach in. Show me some leg. Hmm, all right, go take a seat over there. Now, as you can see, I'm a very busy man, but you look like you have potential. I think I can find something for you. - Oh really, you really think that I've got potential? Sure, kid, sure. Got good looks, talent, I'll find you some work. How do you know I have talent? You've never seen me act. Kid, everyone acts. We act all the time. I just gotta find the right thing to place you in. - Oh, how do we do that, Mr. Green? Call me Morty, doll. We're gonna have to work closely together, very closely, right? And we're gonna have to get to know each other, much better, right? I guess so. - So, tell me something about yourself. Well there's not much to tell. I'm from Oklahoma, and I'm engaged to Billy Martin back there. - Really? Oh, that's very interesting. Tell you what, doll, I want you to go to this party this afternoon at 1100 Coldwater. Go home, get yourself dolled up, here, kid. - Wow, I'll see you a little later. I really appreciate this. Yeah, sure. Fiance, huh? Well, that isn't much of a problem. - Dominique settled right into the California life. Now when Iaconda hits 75, sell. Right. I'm gonna be working on this business deal all morning. Think you can amuse yourself? - Yeah, I'm just gonna go lay in the sun. - I'll pick you up later for lunch. Okay. You better dress for it. We're going to a very important party afterward. Oh. It might even be fun. How's this? Perfect. Okay. All right, well. We'll catch you later. - Okay. - Pat's life was typical of most starstruck college students, going to school, classes in drama and speech, hoping for that one big break, never believing for even a moment she wouldn't make it. Well of course, uh, you know that talent isn't enough to make in this business. You need to have the right connections. - Well isn't that what agents are for? - Sure, but do you think Sue Mangross is really gonna sign you right out of acting school? You need to know the right people just to talk to a good agent. - Well how do I make the right connections? - Well, I could help you for instance. There's a little party this afternoon, a cocktail party, and there will be executives, studio heads, agents. Why don't you come along with me? - I'd love to, what time should I be ready? - Well, the party's at two, but I thought beforehand we could, uh- - Okay, I'll be ready at 1:30, bye, thanks. - All three girls were excited about going to a real Hollywood party. Strangely enough, all three chose the same method to help themselves relax. - There you go, I'll catch you later. I got some business to talk. Okay. - There's no such thing as a private party in Hollywood. Some of these people invite the press on their honeymoons. So we were all out in force for this one. The biggies figured to get some business done, meaning publicity of course. I didn't bother to take notes. I could make it all up later anyway. As long as I spelled the names write. Oh, seafood, where'd you get it? - Haven't you seen the waiters going around? - No, I don't think I've gotten the chance. Oh, there he is, waiter. Aw, good. Thank you. So, do you belong here? - Let's just say it's part of my job. But I'm not personally a celebrity. Oh, are you an actress? No. - Did I hear you say that you're an actress? No. - I am, at least I'm studying acting anyway. - Yeah, I've never ever wanted to be anything else. That's why I'm here from Oklahoma, I'm gonna be a star. - I'll be glad if I can get a job without having to fuck everybody in Southern California for it. What do you mean? - Yeah, that's how all the big stars got their start. Everybody knows that. - At least I'm straightforward about it. I'm a hooker, darlings, a whore? I'm very good, very expensive, but that's still the word for it. The only difference between me and an actress is, I admit what I am. Is that really how it works? I don't know if I could do that. It's just business, dear. - Yeah, and it's pretty hard to do it on just talent alone. Do you have an agent or something? Yes, Morty Green. Oh, here he is, hi, Morty. - Come on, sweetie, got somebody for you to meet. Geez. Mary Jo, this is Jack Warren, he's the head of Magnum Productions. Jack, this is the actress I was telling you about. - Yeah, Morty tells me you've got a lot of talent. - Yeah, well, I did the lead in East Lynn back home. Oh yeah, Morty mentioned that. Oh, well, we might be able to use you in something. Hey, make the arrangements, Morty. It was nice meeting you, kid. Yeah, it's nice to meet you too. What do you think of him? He's not very comforting. - He's not supposed to be, he's a producer. You know, sweetie, you're not really burdened down with credentials or anything. You're not a Broadway star. No, I guess not. - Right, and that man can cut through a lot of the bullshit and get you a screen test real fast. But you may have to do a couple of favors for him. Follow me? What kinda favors? - Whatever he wants, now do you follow me? - Yeah, but I told Billy Martin I'd be faithful to him. - Yeah, and you told Billy Martin you'd return home a star, right? You do wanna be a star, don't you? In order to be a star, you need a screen test, right? Look, you got a terrific bod. A lotta people in this town are gonna wanna get in your pants. Now Jack Warren is probably the biggest man in this town at this point, a real go-getter. If he wants to make you a star, you're a star. Now don't be dumb, do it. Isn't there any other way? - Oh yeah, you can wait a couple of years, and try a lot of bit parts, and then maybe you'll get a test. But this way you'll do it fast. You understand what I'm saying, right? You've got it, baby, do it. - Rudy used to, he was one of my students before he went into directing. Yeah, he's done pretty well. Joe, can we leave now, please? Yeah, sure. Um, it was good to meet you. We'll see you again sometime. Give me a call at the office. Okay, come on, let's go. - Poor Pat, she finally discovered love. It hit her like a thunderbolt. One look from Steve Ransom, and her panties were dripping. Too bad he was such a louse. You coming? Hey, I thought you wanted to leave. Well, fuck it, I'm leaving. - My place tomorrow night at 7:30 sharp. Be there. Okay. Nice meeting you. Morty Green, how's Hollywood's pimp to the stars? - Hi ya, Fred, I'm an agent, you know that. Oh yeah right. - It's a tough world out there, you gotta make deals. - Yeah, but do the girls know that? What's the difference? Fuck off, sweetie. 75 million? - Well I don't know, I think we do a little more maybe. - It's a possibility, but I don't know. I don't wanna overdo that price. - Well, the budget has gotta be there. Hello, darling. Dominique, Jerry Cominsky. Jerry, Dominique. - Dominique, Michael's been telling me a lot about you. He says you're an artist. Ah, he's too kind. I'm just a working girl who's good at her job. Well, he says you're the best. That's possible, even likely. Well, talk's cheap. I'm not. But it's taken care of. I see. Excuse me. Have a seat. - One thing you have to give Morty Green, when he made a deal, he stuck to it. Would you care for a drink? Yes please. - He promised to deliver Mary Jo, and he did. Of course, he hadn't promised Mary Jo anything. There you go. Thank you. - Why don't you make yourself comfortable? In the bedroom, down at the end of the hall. Okay. Mrs. Warren. You startled me, I wasn't expecting you. I live here. Of course, of course, but Mr. Warren told me that, uh, I mean, Mr. Warren and I were supposed to, but Morty told me. - I'm afraid you misunderstood Mr. Green. - I'm the Warren that checks out all the new girls. But. Are you shocked? No, not shocked. The idea sort of excites me. I just never done it with a woman before. Well you just relax and follow my lead. - Gee, that's really sweet of you, Jerry, but I won't be here. - What do you mean you won't be here? You've gotta be here. - Well, Michael's traveling back to New York after his business is finished, and I'm gonna go with him. I think we're going in the morning. - Well I can't get everything set up for today. Can't you stay on? It just doesn't interest me. Besides, this isn't your business sense talking. It's your cock. - Look, I know that you're good enough to persuade me, but that's not it. Any film executive gets laid a lot. You learn to keep that separate from your judgment. Do you think it's easy or cheap to set up a full screen test? No, but it's ridiculous. I'm not an actress, I'm a whore. - Well you could say that about half the female stars in the business. But look, I'm really serious. I don't care if you don't have experience. You've got something better than that. Call it magnetism, charisma, whatever, it. You have got it, believe me. It's not that common either. You shouldn't let it go to waste. - Look, Jerry, it just isn't my line of work, okay? What's your day rate? My what? - Your day rate, what you get paid by the day or night or whatever. Oh, yeah, $500. - Well I think I can scrape that together. Look, suppose I pay you for a week? Now are you willing to stay here and do a screen test? Expenses, too, and hotel. - Well, I did promise Michael I'd be traveling with him. - And if I can square it with him? - You're really determined, aren't you? Completely. - Okay, if you can get the studio to pay for a whore for a week to take a screen test, and square it with Michael, I'll do it. But I'm warning you, Jerry, you're wasting your time and your money. Don't worry about that. And it won't be the studio's money, it'll be mine. With your money? I thought this was a studio deal. Now wait a minute, I don't wanna- - Look, doll, this is strictly legit. I'm laying out my money because I'm a gambler. You got what it takes to be a star, and if you come across on this screen test the way I think you will, I'm signing you to a personal management contract. I'm gonna handle you personally. - I don't think I like the sound of that. Don't worry, you will. - Okay, okay, I'll do it, if you can square it with Michael. No sweat, talk to you soon. Okay, bye-bye. Hi, good, come in. Pat was drawn to her fate like a moth to a flame. With just about the same consequences. Take your clothes off. Come on, come on, move it, I haven't got all day. On your knees, bitch. Here. Good, I'm reasonably well satisfied. What about me? - I have no objections if you're also satisfied. I'll make no effort to arrange it. However, it's a matter of total indifference to me. Oh. - Your object here is not to be pleased, but to please. As long as you fulfill your function, you may do as you wish. You may live in this house. Anything you wear will be my decision, and anything you do will be up to me. Correct? Yes. - At my whim, you will service me sexually. Yes. Yes, master. Yes, master. - If I wish to loan you to any of my friends, you'll service them also. Yes, master. - You'll do anything that's asked of you. Anything. Yes, master. Good. - Hey, isn't it time for your coffee break? I don't drink coffee. Well maybe something to eat? Like what? Well how about me? Right here? - You're paying for it, so why not? - No no, too many people come in through the office. - There must be a quiet place around here somewhere. - Okay, you talked me into it, you silver-tongued fox. Here's an empty one. Oh, this is fine. The couch is even comfy. - Mary Jo's little session with Mrs. Warren did pay off, she got her screen test. But like everything else connected with Morty Green, even the screen test had strings attached. - Okay, sweetie, this is it, you all ready? I guess so. But isn't there a script or something. Nah, don't worry about it, you wanna be spontaneous, right? Looking good is what's important. If you look good, you got it made. Well, do I look all right? You look terrific. But the camera may see you a little different than I do. The cameraman is very important. He can make you look good or bad. - Well he'll do his best, won't he? - I'm sure he will, but I can't guarantee it. I don't wanna take any chances. Hi. Mary Jo, this is Curtis, the director of this scene. Hello. Hello. Oh, uh, here's your script. Oh, gee, I hope I can do well. - Hey, I'm sure you'll do just fine. But you know, there is a lotta stuff I can do to help you out. Do you think that you could? - Well, I'm really not supposed to. - Come on, I know Mary Jo can so something to convince you. You know, make it worth your while. Morty, I couldn't afford it. Oh, no money, sweetheart. I'm sure you got something a lot better than that to offer. Oh, Morty. - That's the way it's done, sweetie. Just come right on over here. Bruce, you wanna? Yeah, boss. - All right, why don't you just lay right down here and we'll get you ready? - Dominique got her screen test too. - I'm the first woman he's ever met who's as interesting as one of his men friends. Now that's love. Cut. Okay, Dominique, let's try it a little differently this time. I want you to rearrange this line here. I want you to project more, and I want you to look into the camera, okay? All right. Well hot damn. I was right. - Picked a good one, Jer, she's got it. - Mm-hmm, a star is born, as we say. - She can't act worth a damn, but she'll learn. And it won't matter, she'll be a smash. If the film picks up half of it, she's got it made. Yep. Where'd you find her? Well, uh, I don't know yet. The PR boys'll think of something. Let's do it again. - I talk too much, I'm quite bright, but nevertheless, I talk too much. You see, already I'm saying more than I should. Now, men hate it for women to blurt out, I'm bright. In fact, that's what I'm saying, I'm brighter than even the brightest men I know. That's why it's a mistake to take too much. - My lawn furniture has more talent than that. Yep. - Of course, if my lawn furniture had that kinda magnetism, I could open a scrapyard without moving. Yep. Can she learn? Yep. - Is there anything in that girl's background that's gonna be a problem? Yep. Shit, what? She's a hooker. Oh, that's a PR problem. Yep. No sweat, when can you sign her? I already have. Without the old man's okay? Not to a studio contract, to a personal management contract. - The old man is gonna have a hemorrhage. - Fuck the old man, this girl's gonna be bigger than this whole fuckin' operation. Well, hello. Hi, I'm Sem. I'll be producing this epic. You look good, very good. Good enough to eat. So why don't you? I think I will. - Hey, wait a minute, where do you think you're going? Don't mess up the makeup. - Steve Ransom did make some movie connections for Sue. Of course, they weren't the type of films she spent all that time in drama school studying for. But it turned out okay, since she discovered she liked sex more than acting anyway. - Hey, hey come on, let's save that for the picture. We got a picture to make, let's go. Hey, come on! Let's go, we got a picture to make! Get outta here! What the hell's wrong with you people? Get going. Come on, we got a hit to make. Okay, Mike, roll it. I talk to much. I'm quite bright, so isn't it interesting? But nevertheless, I talk too much. You see I already am saying more than I should. Men hate me for, women to blurt out, I'm bright. They think they, think she's really saying I'm brighter than you are. What do you think? Well, I can't use her. I know Jeff wouldn't want her. I could use her. Yeah? - I'm going to Vegas next week to try and sign Mel Carter for a film. He likes that type. Well, put in a call to Morty. - So, while they're deciding whether or not to offer you a contract, we do have that offer from Las Vegas. And he could help me? I'm sure he could. - Oh, yeah, and I should screw him too. - That'd be interesting, but no, he's a faggot. Just needs an escort, you got clothes? Yeah, when do I go? - Monday, have a good time, sweetie. All right, bye-bye, Morty. - So I put on my pants and get the hell outta there before her husband came home. I love it. - Excuse me, I have to go to the little girls' room. Of course. Don't be long, sweetheart. No. - Well, what do you think, should we have a contract drawn? I'm leaning in that direction. Of course, you haven't made your final offer yet. What do you mean? - You don't expect me to believe you brought that young lady along for your own amusement, do you? Can't fool you, can I? Shall I have her delivered to your room? Yes. 11, and you can call your lawyers in the morning. You got a deal. Good night now. Sorry I took so long. That's all right, darling. To your success. Oh yeah. - Well, what did you think of the famous Mel Carter? - He's very attractive, and he's awfully charming. - I think you should know that the attraction is mutual. In fact, he expects you in his room at 11. - Oh, but, I just, I don't know if I could. I've just met the man and all. Yeah, but you see, if you're not at his room at 11 tonight, he won't sign the contract. Oh. - And the studio doesn't forget people who help it. - But what Mel Carter really wanted wasn't exactly what Mary Jo was expecting. Mary Jo, this is my wife, Susan. Susan, Mary Jo. How do you do, Mary Jo? How do you do? - I suppose Mel's explained our little quirk to you. Yes, ma'am. - Why don't you have a seat, Mary Jo? Thank you. - So we discovered many years ago that sex was so much better for us whenever we had someone watching. Yes, Mel gets so much harder and fucks me so much longer when we have an audience, and I come so much better. Script, script? We don't need no stinkin' script. No no. If they miss a cue, then I'll give them one. It's in and out, in and out. Come on, get off of it. Dave? Pete here. Yeah, I wanna talk to you about that girl you sent. No, no, no, no no. No, there's no problems, man, no problems at all. No no no, you won't have to discipline her. Believe you me, you won't have to discipline her. No no, she's uh, she's, she's just great. She is just absolutely great. - Really, Jerry, we've played this farce long enough. Now you've had your fun, and it's time for me to go back to New York. Look, how can I convince you? The contract is sitting right out here in front of you. All it needs is your signature. And you still think this is a game. Do you think the studio would go this far as a joke? - Well I don't know about that, but I do know that I'm no actress. I can't memorize my lines, I can't move, out of bed, anyway. I haven't got a trained voice. I just don't know the first thing about acting. You don't have to. That's what we're here for, to make you look like you know what you're doing. But I don't understand. Now why would the studio wanna go to all the trouble for someone with no talent? - Look, I've told you before, you've got something more than talent. When the public sees you up there on the screen, they're gonna love you, no matter what you do. Because you've got magnetism. And that's worth a lot more than talent. You won't have to rely on a good script or a good performance. Your fans are gonna love you, just seeing you in the movies. Look at Raquel Welch, I mean, she can't act as well as you can, and she's a top star. - So the studio is willing to pay me to stand in front of a camera and make a fool of myself? More than you make now. That's an awful lot, you know. Yes, we know. - Suppose my first film is terrible. It probably will be. But it'll make money. And don't forget, it's a three-film contract, so you can always go back to New York when it's over. - You're not leaving me any way out of this, are you? Nope, that's the idea. Will you sign? Can I think about it? Sure, I'll give you 15 seconds. - So have you heard from the studio yet? - Yeah, sweetie, and, sorry to tell you. Although I've pulled every string I could, they won't sign you. But in Las Vegas they said- - Not everybody in this business is as honest as I am. Quite frankly, I don't know what I'm gonna be able to do with you. The other studios aren't signing people at this time. - But there must be something. Well, there is one possibility. Yeah? I can't guarantee it. And I'd have to call in a lotta favors for you to get a shot at it, but. Yeah? - And, you're gonna have to make it worth my while. Oh, you'll get your 30%. No, I want more than that. - Mr. Green, what kind of girl do you think I am? A whore, what else? - Mary Jo may have been slow to learn, but she finally figured out that she just wasn't gonna make it in Hollywood, and that she was better off back in Oklahoma. So she headed back to the arms and the bed of her boyfriend. Lucky for him, he was smart enough to overlook her little escapade in the big city. Sue's slide downhill continued, with some help from Steve Ransom. She became overwhelmed in sex. Porn movies and prostitution became her whole life. - Ladies and gentlemen of the press, the studio is proud to present our newest star, Miss Dominique Allwin. So that's it. The two girls who came to town to become stars struck out. Instead, a high-priced hooker from New York took the town by storm. But I don't get the point. What's the point of the story? There is no point. Look, it's just like the rest of this town. Everything is glitter and tinsel and tits and ass. And everybody's a whore, male and female alike. There is no point. That's the point. - Wait a minute, I don't understand. - He he, don't worry, kid, you will. Welcome to Tinseltown USA.
