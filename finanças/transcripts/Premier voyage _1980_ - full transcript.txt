Marie, dear, I've told your aunt. She's coming. TELEGRAM: COME DAD. MOM DIED. Oh! Orion! Mom! Mom. Mom, the dog bit me. Can I punish him? Look. Why are you sleeping too much? You forget he's not been seen for four years. If he were truly interested in his kids, wouldn't he have seen them from time to time? They had their mom. We'll see. We'll see if he's there first, and then we can check if he intends to take them. When did you tell him? Yesterday morning. I sent a telegram. I hope he's not at sea. The sea, always the sea. The perfect excuse. He doesn't even know his son. Orion! KITTY FOR M'S BIKE Aunty, that's Mom's record. Poor little thing. Hello kiddo. Hello Vincent. Did you see Mom? Yes, she's asleep. Marie, we came as soon as we could. Poor things. Come on kids. Where? -To say farewell to your mom. -No. -What do you mean "no"? -No! But why? What's going on Marie? You can't let your mom go without a final farewell. Come with me Vincent. What's wrong with her? Sadness. No, it's because she's stubborn like her father. What on earth… My Christmas tree. Keeping a Christmas tree up all year is definitely something your Mom would do. You're mean! There are lots of trees in the forest. Yes but I wanted that one. Thanks. Here. No news, of course? -He'll never change. -He isn't going to write. He'll come straight here to fetch us. I'm hungry. Anyhow you can't stay in this house all by yourselves. And it's also not yours. And we can't wait forever for your father to make a decision. We're all leaving after the funeral tomorrow. Vincent will go to Louis's and you can come with me to do the bookkeeping. She knows nothing about bookkeeping. Oh, because you're a bookkeeping expert, are you? He'll come here to fetch us. If he comes. He'll come. Why are you so sure? I know it. That's all. Listen, Marie. You are 16 years old and you don't get to decide. You're leaving with us tomorrow. Because your father… I'd warned your mom. Where are you going? To fetch the dog. No. I'm allergic to dogs. -Ow! Ow! -Sit down. Your dog will give me spots. This is for you. I'm giving it to you. It may be a bit big but you can't wander around like that. Mom made me this dress. For tomorrow, do you have a suitable suit for Vincent? Tomorrow? Yes. For the funeral. SLEEPER CAR 5 NICE, MARSEILLE, AVIGNON, PARIS Listen, Marie. Be reasonable. If your dad finally decides to look after you, she won't prevent it, I assure you. Why do you say "finally"? Because he hasn't really been present much until now. It's because he didn't get my telegram. You have a lot of faith in him. Yes, of course. Last time I saw him, he said he liked it as it is rather than seeing us on the fly. For the time being, let Jeanne organize your lives. Your brother is only five. I don't want them to separate us, Uncle Louis. You can't really stop them. Will you help me? Breathe. Please, Mom. Breathe. Mom. They won't separate us. I promise you. Vincent and I are going to leave tomorrow. No, this evening. We'll go to join Dad. Do you want that? Do you, Mom? It's night-time, so why aren't we sleeping? Because we're playing at hiding. Give me your hand. Marie. DEAR UNCLE LOUIS. I'M LEAVING WITH VINCENT. YOU CAN HELP ME BY NOT TELLING THE POLICE. WILL YOU HAVE THE STRENGTH TO DO THAT? I'D BE HAPPY IF YOU DID BECAUSE I LIKE YOU A LOT. BE SO KIND AND STAY QUIET. LOTS OF LOVE. No one believed that Marie was ill. Still not want to report it? Don't insist, I'm telling you. I'm their lawful guardian, so it's up to me to decide. Yes, it's crazy. Two kids lost alone in the wild. Anything could happen. Marie is not a kid anymore. She's 16 years old. And I'm sure she's going to her father's. Exactly, we know what Yan's like. Be quiet. You've not changed your mind? No. Do you have the papers? I've lost my wallet. Paul, have you not seen it? No. You should have it. Someone has taken it. It's Marie, I'm sure. Ladies and gentlemen. Sir. -Come on. -Where are we going? To see Dad. Why didn't we see him before? You're too little to understand. No, I'm big. Orion! Orion! Why are we hiding from Pierrot? Who does that knife belong to? It's mine. Dad gave it to me. Can you see? He engraved my name on it. Why did we leave Mom while she was asleep? What did you say? I saw. Mom was asleep. She didn't reply, so… Why are we afraid? Since we don't know what they're looking for. Do you think they hunt kids? No, my love. Do kid hunters exist? Ow, you're hurting me. My backpack is hurting me. -Do you want us to leave? -Yes. They've gone. We can go now. I don't want to. Wait. I've had enough. Oh! Look at that pretty bird. You didn't look at the bird. You never look at anything. You're no fun! Come here, Orion. We're not actually going to sleep, are we? Listen, Vincent. I didn't sleep at all. Personally, I'm not tired. Are you asleep, Marie? It's the last time. Oh I've gone all floppy. Cluck, cluck. Not outside! The cockerel. Oh dear. It's not easy to catch. I want Mom. Marie! Marie! Vincent. Vincent? Orion? Marie! Vincent, reply! Vincent! Vincent! Vincent! Vincent, my love, did you hurt yourself? Vincent, my baby. Are you hurt? Where does it hurt? You're nice, even so. Did you say "even so"? Don't you think that's a bit cheeky? Why can't we go back to see Mom? Because Dad is waiting for us. Does he have a car? Yes. Do you think he'll teach me to drive? Yes. Marie, wake up. It's daytime and I'm hungry. Listen, Vincent. I didn't sleep again last night and I've had enough. I've had enough too. Are you asleep? Are you asleep, Marie? It's not funny, she's always sleeping. Are you a good swimmer? Yes, a very good one. Why do you know how to swim? Because Mom taught me. Mom's nice, isn't she? What's she going to say when she finds out we left? She won't say anything, because I left a note. I told her we are going to see Dad. Look. We're here and we're going there. The blue there is the sea so we're going to go along these plateaux. And then along the lakes towards Saint Martin de Vésubie. What's Saint Martin de Vésubie? Saint Martin de Vésubie is a village. Come on. Orion! Come here, doggie. -Doggie. -Doggie! Come on! -After that, we'll get back to Mom? -Yes, yes. Why do you have to walk so much in the mountains? Is Dad's place a long way? Is Dad's place far from here? He lives in a harbor, on a boat. A real one? Yes, a real one. I even slept on it once. A long time ago. We went fishing. With me? No, you weren't born yet. Why wasn't I born yet? I don't know, my love. Because you weren't born. We'll go buy some food and you won't say a word to anyone, okay? -Why? -Because. -Because what? -Shit, just listen to me! Back at you. I want to go back to Mom's. I don't want to have fun anymore, I'm going to tell Mom. -Are you hungry? Yes or no? -Yes. We'll go the village and buy food, but don't tell anyone. I won't say anything, as I don't know anyone. -Is anyone there? -It smells of candy. Is anyone there? Have you been here long? No, we just arrived. I'd like a pound of oranges, please. And popsicles. -Yes, popsicles, four apples… -And toffee. Popsicles, four apples, toffee, one goat's cheese licorice sticks, matches and batteries for my torch please. You're speeding ahead. Chocolate and Biscrok cookies. I worry I may forget something. I bet you're here on vacation. No. Yes, he doesn't know what he's saying. Where are you staying? At André's. André's the stonemason? Yes, ma'am. Thanks ma'am. How much do I owe you? Vincent? I scared you. Are you hitchhiking? You dislike parties and you're off. We have to. We're going to Antibes. I'll take you. Let's go! How fast does your car go? 110 mph, no problem, kiddo. -Well I never! -So have you decided? Let's go, then! There. You're not sitting in the back, there's a seat in the front. No, I'm getting in with him. You're a pain in the ass. It's my lucky day. Is the dog clean? Can I have one? Yes. Just one though. Why? They aren't mine. Why do you have them in your car then? Do you want one or not? Is he your son? Who is your son? Of course he's my son. Why did you do that? They are all bastards. Stop it, you're ruining the leather! He didn't damage anything at all! Anyway, it's not leather. It's fake leather. Yes, it's fake leather. It's not fake, it's real leather. My car cost eight million. Eight million! There's a noise coming from the engine. What are you doing? Nothing. There's a noise coming from the engine. Do you not want to drop us off? We'll carry on on foot. Stay there. Run away Vincent. Stay there. Stay there. Don't move. Run away Vincent. Run! Stop moving! Vincent, go! Go! Is he dead? Is he dead? I'm hungry. Do you want some? It would be great if we had fries and chocolate. And steak. Don't you think? Why aren't you saying anything? You're tired, aren't you? You're tired, aren't you? I'm going for a swim. It's probably too cold. Come on, let's get in the water! -There. -In the water. Come, Orion. -Do you know where we are? -No. Are we lost? Mom has got maps. Is he dead? Who? The man with the car. Mom. I can remember it really well. Dad took me on his boat so I could watch him fish for spring rats. They are very pink. They drool and are very hard to catch because they jump. Do you know spring rats? Listen, Vincent. If you had been on his boat I would remember it. You were still very small. You've either forgotten or you weren't there. Maybe you were at school. Where are stars? In the sky. They aren't there now. -Are you okay? -Yes. -Let's go, okay? -Where? To the gas station to pick up a map. Why? Are we still lost? No. Come on. Let's go but don't say a word, okay? I won't say a word, since you always say that to me. -Promise? -Yes. Good. Let's go, Orion. Who are you? A boy. I can see you're a boy, stupid. Do you have a dog? Yes, he wants milk. Do you have some? Your dog drinks milk? Yes he loves it. Come with me. I can't. My sister doesn't want me to. I've checked but I can't find an Alpes-Maritimes map. We're out of stock. Don't you have any left? Are you drinking his milk? I'm checking if it's good. Orion. Orion. Can I borrow it for two minutes, please? Thanks. Look, the man. He's not dead. That's a good thing. Orion! -What an earth is that? -It's a dog. No animals in the coach. There are ducks there, so… A duck is not a dog. Yes, but it's an animal. It's not the same thing at all. Let's get off, it smells too bad here. He doesn't want my dog. Loser. A duck and a dog are as similar as a driver and a moron. The bikes aren't ours! Never mind, let's go. Come quickly Vincent. Orion, come. I'm cold! I said I'm cold. Can't you hear? Why aren't we going further with the bike? I'm fed up, I'm tired. When will we stop? What are you doing? We're locking ourselves in. Why are we locking ourselves in? -Oh look! -Hush, Vincent. Stop talking loudly in here. It's Jesus. What? I'm not sure, as you know. Oh, hush Vincent. Oh shit. Did you say a rude word? -Here? -Yes. My stomach hurts. What? Mom would massage me like this and the pain would go away. Come here. The pain doesn't go away when you do it. It doesn't go away when you do it. I'm sleepy. -Are you comfy? -No, I want Mom. Yes. Will she come to fetch me? Yes. Come now. Go to sleep. Is anyone there? Is anyone there? Is anyone there? Quick, wake up. Steady. What's going on? My little brother is in danger. Come quickly. Steady. -Is that your little brother? -Yes. He seems okay, no? No, there's a crazy guy. Who's your crazy guy? He's here. He's following us everywhere. Everywhere we go. He's even got a Range Rover. I'm scared. Do you know him? He took us as hitchhikers. He was being a pest with me so I knocked him out. I can join you for some of the way if you want. Listen, I know what we'll do. The train stops for ten minutes in Puget-Théniers. I'll take you to the coach and you can go to a friend's. I don't want to bother anyone. Yes, yes. It will do him some good. He's quite a solitary guy. Right. -Thanks. -You're welcome. What a stupid life. There are loads of cars like that. Stop looking. Do you not get that that's what he wants? It's over now. I'll take you to coach and that'll be it. Hello. Can you drop them at Platanes junction? -What? -Me. Thanks. -See you, buddy. Take care. -See you. Thanks for everything. No worries. Is that her mom? Yes. God, what's he doing with a car like that? FAST FRENCH RIVIERA Look. Shit. What now? What do you want? Your friend Charles sent us. The door is open. Come in. What's going on now? Sorry if I'm disturbing you. Did Charles send you? Yes. Could you put us up for one night? We're getting a coach to Antibes tomorrow. Right. Come with me. Do you think he'll give us a bed? Yes, most likely. There. You can stay here if you want. Thanks. Where's Orion? What? The dog. Under the bed. Orion? Orion! He's a bit quiet, isn't he? I'll go get some water. Wait here. No, Marie. I don't want to be alone. I'm scared. Not anymore. I don't know where we are. We're at a friend of Charles's house. I don't even know his name. His name is Jean Decaze. Come on, be nice. Wait here, okay? I don't want to stay alone. I'd rather sort it out alone. Don't worry, I can pay you for it. I have money. It's an old pitcher. I didn't like it anyway. It was ugly. I'll wash it. Yes, the dish towel will need washing. I'll wash it. What are you doing in my office? What's got into you? The man knocked us out, he wants revenge so… And also because we hurt him. Wait, I don't understand anything. Can you explain what's going on? I would have told you, but you left. You left us both alone. I know we're bothering you. We won't bother you for long. Just tell me what's going on. You always tell me not to say anything to anyone and then… It's not the same with him. He's Charles's friend and we had to. I can't get through to your Dad. I don't think he's got a phone. How do you know? I called the post office. Who told you to call the post office? You. I never said to call the post office! Yes. You, your brother and your dog. Your fear of the guy who you claim is following you. He was following me, I'm telling you. I tell you everything, I tell you about my mom, about my dad, about our journey and you… Charles would never have made a secret phone call like that. -Never! -It was to help you. We can do without your help! For God's sake! You show up here, you lock up, you use my kitchen, you break a pitcher, you dirty my dish towels and now you're yelling at me. Stop shouting, both of you! We're not shouting! Yes, you're shouting. We'll go see Dad tomorrow. I'm sure he's waiting for us. We'll leave at 7 a.m. Okay. I made an omelet, if you want some. No thanks. I'm not hungry. Enjoy. He's angry. Do you think he wants to see us? Of course he wants to see us. Has he seen me before? Yes, but you were tiny. Why don't I know him? Because you were little. Where is his boat? In Antibes. And if he's not there, what do we do? It doesn't matter if we can't find him. We'll go home. Which home? Mom's home. Listen Vincent. There were three of us before. There was Mom, you and me. Now just the two of us will get by. And Mom? Mom is dead. Are you okay? It's me. What are you doing here? I'm sorry about earlier. I wanted to ask you to forgive me. I really don't know what got into me. I shouldn't have called. No, don't be silly. We're the ones disturbing you. No, it's true. You really are disturbing me but that's a good thing. I mean, it's good that you came. I'm pleased. I'm very pleased. I also wanted to tell you that you can sleep peacefully. I did a lap outside and I couldn't see anyone. That guy of yours must have given up. Right. Goodnight. Goodnight. Orion. Orion. Do you know what time it is? Aren't you tired anymore? It's 5 a.m. I'm not tired, I'm hungry. Don't you have any milk? No, I don't have any milk. Here. Don't you have any butter either? Nor any butter. Do you have jam then? No. -So you don't have anything? -Not much. -Can I take some sugar? -Yes. Go on. -Do you know what time it is? -5 a.m. Would you like tea or coffee? Coffee please. That's lucky, because I don't have any tea either. Eat. No, I don't want any anymore. -Just a little. -No. What's wrong? No, nothing. It's nice to see you laughing, that's all. I'm laughing because I know I'm right. Right about what? That Dad is waiting for us. We'll see, won't we? We? Surely you don't think I'm going to let you go alone? We don't need anyone. Well now! Right. We meet in half an hour. Why? There comes a time when kids must let the grown-ups take charge. Hurry up. We're going. -Are we not waiting for Jean? -No. Why didn't we take Jean's car? Don't you like this? Yes but Jean is kind and I prefer cars to coaches. COACH STOP There. Is that the sea? Yes, it's the sea. Orion. Where are you going? To Mr. Lambert's. He's not lived here for a long time. Do you have his new address? I never had it. Does he live in Antibes though? I told you, I've no idea. Vincent! Come, he's here! Is that Dad's boat? Yes. Well, it's the one he works on. Shall we go to it? What if I've made a mistake? What do we do then? Listen, let's sit and wait until he comes. If you have made a mistake and it is Dad's boat, there's no point in waiting. It's Dad's boat but he's not on it now. Look. They must know Dad so why don't you ask them? No, I don't think so. Where are we going to sleep? If you don't want to go to the boat. We'll sleep here. That way, we won't miss Dad. -Where, here? -Here. -But where, here? -Here, in the cave. It's not a cave. It's an archway. Here. Thanks. Wait. Come here. Come closer to me. You're on the ground there. Is that okay? We're comfy here, right? Yes. When is Dad going to come back? Tomorrow. Tomorrow. You always say tomorrow. -Hello. -Hello. Well? What are you doing here? Me? I'm watching you. Yes. I can see, yes. Are you alone? Yeah. That bridge is handy for getting on to your boat. Don't you find? Yes. Can I come? Yes. Take your shoes off. -Why? -What? -Why? -Why what? Why do I need to take my shoes off? So as not to damage the boat, of course. Is it possible to sleep on the boat? Yes. You can sleep anywhere, you know. I know. Really? I'm going to put this… I can help you, if you want. No thanks. I do this stuff alone. Don't you ever get bored alone? Never. Never. -What's that? -What? -That. -That's a… I don't know. It's a thingy. Why? Can I have it? If you want. Thanks. You're welcome. If I ever manage to get it off. There. Wait, we'll put it here. It's pretty, isn't it? How old are you? Five years old. Five years old? -There. -Can you take my sweater off? You want me to take your sweater off? First we need to undo the straps. Are you okay? The straps. There. Can you take my sweater off? Lift your arms. Let's keep the T-shirt on. There, sir. Thanks. Can you put my straps back on? Anything else? Do you also want me to wash your feet? Or cut your hair, or… And you think it's funny too, do you? I'll put the straps back on with the badge, okay? They need telling their fasteners aren't great. -There, sir. -Thanks, You're welcome. So? How come you're wandering about alone? It's because I wake up early. Really? Are your parents on a boat here? No. Mom is dead. My sister and I came to look for our Dad. He's got a boat here. That's good. Very good. Maybe we shouldn't have come. But we had to because my aunt didn't like Orion. Orion? -Who is that? -My dog. Right. There they are. -Who? -My bosses. I must go. I need to raise the anchor. Can I come? -Are you going for long? -Yes. Two months. Can I come? What do you want to come as? As a cook? As a cabin boy? Ow! Holy cow! What are you doing here? Come on. Skedaddle! Come on. Anyway, I prefer sailing boats. They are much more beautiful. Really? Go see them. You never know, maybe they'll hire you. This boat here, it's a boat for grown-ups. And this thing still doesn't work. Marie, are you asleep? Marie? Did you see it go? Who? Dad's boat. We're not sure if it is Dad's boat. Did you see it go? No. Who gave you that? I found it on the ground. Are you hungry? No, I found some bread in a trash can up there. You haven't seen my knife, have you? Subtitle translation by: Ginger Clark
