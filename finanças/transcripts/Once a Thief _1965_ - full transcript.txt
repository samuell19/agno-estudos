Let me hear you say, "Oh, yeah!" - "Oh, yeah!" - "Oh, yeah!" Let me hear you say, "Oh, yeah!" - "Oh, yeah!" - "Oh, yeah!" There aren't very many real people left. The only real people I know are dead. Pushed into nut houses, lobotomy, junk, suicide. Or really cooling it and saying nothing to nobody. I got a great deal. Amphetamine, caps, crystals. Anything you want. No? Keep your trip. You don't need nothin'. I'll see you later. Don't look at me like that. I can read your head. Dolly and Patty have nothing to do with thee and me. I don't, I don't wanna hear anymore about them dykes, Lana. And if you don't cool this lickety-split talk-talk jazz you're gonna get my paranoia goin'. I'll tell you that. Come on, Eddie, let's go. What'd he say? Two men, couldn't see one guy but he got a good look at the killer. About 30, six-foot tall, dark-haired wearin' a sheep skin coat. Drove away in an old car. Sounds like a Model A. - Carl. - 'Yes?' Let me have the ballistics on that as quick as you can. - Okay, inspector. - Go on. Well, the killer's name was mentioned but the Chinaman's not sure. Said the other guy called him "Freddie" or something like that. He finally goofed. You know who it was? Pedak. Bella, Edward. There's an immigration notice here. Is he a citizen? He's from Trieste. Isn't that your hometown? Inspector Vido. No, no, don't pick him up yet. Just hang with him. At the right time I'll pick him up. That's right. Okay. Unless you got something specific don't pull in Pedak. I'm waiting for ballistics, lieutenant. That'll be specific. It better be airtight this time. The department wants no complaints about police brutality. Proof, Vido. Sheepskin coat a Model A Ford, a man named Eddie. The report said "Freddie." The Chinaman heard wrong. It was "Eddie." You better be right. Served 18 months in San Quentin for armed robbery. Been out about six years now. He's going back. Bang. Bang, bang. Kristine! Kristine! Are you ready? Okay, okay. What's it all about? Daddy, daddy. Can I sit in the rumble seat? I won't bounce, I promise. Sure. Come on. - Are you going to tell me? - No. Tell me. Tell me. 'Oh, you're impossible.' Oh, big mystery. You should wear a trench coat. Oh, Eddie. Some men came by a little while ago asking for you. - Who were they? - I don't know. Vido. 'Roger 28. Proceed with surveillance.' 'Pedak vehicle. Keep HQ informed. Over.' - Come on, kid. - On your shoulders, daddy. Will you tell me what's going on? That's my business. See? My own business. Down we go. What do you think? - How did you buy it? - Five hundred down. When I come up with another grand, it's mine. Where'd you get the 500 in the first place? Well, I, uh, I've been holding out on my paychecks. Fifty bucks a month. And you thought I wouldn't approve? Yeah, in a way. Is it really ours, daddy? - Yes! - And it's green. Yes. Tell her your father's story. Tell me. Well, the owl and the pussycat went to sea in a beautiful, pea-green boat. They took some honey and plenty money wrapped up in a five-pound note. Did your daddy really talk that funny? Almost as funny as your daddy talks. My daddy doesn't talk funny. Mm, you're used to him. - I'm gonna go play. - Alright. - Squarehead. - Lop Slav. - Honey. - Hmm? Honey, what about the other $1,000? Oh, no sweat. I've got it all figured. At the end of 30 days I'd have been workin' at O'Hare's for a year. - Mm-hmm. - I'll get a salary loan. Nothing to it. So, now you got a boat and I'm a fish wife, right? - Yeah. - Hmm. Ooh, Kathy. Kathy! Come on. When I was a kid, in Trieste I used to go out on the boats and I liked it. I want to go out there and watch the land disappear. Be free and when I come back home with the land coming back to me I'll be clean. Then we can move out of that dump and get a new place. Trying to tame me? You? Man, I need a chair and a long whip. Oh, I want you the way you are. - Wild! - Oh! Yeah. The doll's eyes close when she lays back. Oh, the doll's playing a game with you. Will you play a game with me? Sure. You have to close your eyes. No, you have to close them for me. 'The bullet on the right was taken' from the body of Lisa Wing. Smith & Wesson, caliber 38. Both bullets were fired from the same gun. The bullet on the left was filed September 1956 taken from the person, of Michael Vido. That's about it. You? Now, you know why I'm bugged on Eddie Pedak. - Inspector. - Hmm? Thank you. He went to Fisherman's Wharf and put a $500 down payment on a boat. He's on his way home now. - I'll put a pick up on him-- - No, not yet. He's not goin' anywhere. I'll let him get a good night's sleep first. Mike, I don't get it. If Pedak put that slug into you then why isn't he doin' time right now? Well, I was a damn fool. I charged in on the job without help and busted right into a tear gas bomb from the vault. Eddie's brother and the rest of the mob were looting the place. Eddie was on the door. And he shot me in the gut. You didn't answer my question. After I got it, I had just enough left in me to reach up and pull his gas mask down. All I saw were his eyes. Court ruled that insufficient evidence. Have you ever been shot in the gut with a 38? No, but how can you be sure it was Pedak? I remember his eyes. Police? Cops don't drive Imperials. Hey, Eddie! He wants to talk to ya. Meow. Kris, I want you to meet my brother, Walter. What does your brother want? I don't know. Sargatanas.. ...couldn't you try to act a little human? I'd never dog your brother. But I'm still the boss of this corporation remember that, huh? You're breaking parole just having him here. I want you to stay out of it. I want them out. You stay out of it, no matter what. Sure, I love to play games with little girls. Would you play a game with me sometime? Kathy? It's your bedtime. Kris. You got a goodnight kiss for Uncle Walter, Kathy? - Oh. - Come on, baby. Read to me, mommy, all about the beautiful, pea-green boat. Uncle Walter and me and mommy and daddy are gonna take some honey and plenty of money and go off in a beautiful pea-green boat. Oh, bravo, Kathy. Goodnight, little girl. Bravo. Goodnight. Eddie. You need that to come to my house? Ah...you used to do better than this when we were together, Eddie. That was the best. The best. What are you here for? Uh, where you workin' these days, huh? I'm getting along fine. Oh, yes, I can see that. Alright, Walter. I'm convinced. You're a big shot. Now, don't knock it, Eddie. You think drivin' a truck is better? How'd you know that? Like I know where you live. Eddie.. ...now, brothers are supposed to help each other. We're even, Walter. I paid you. I paid the state. Almost two years. So, what am I, Mr. Crime? You think I come here to make waves? I don't like to see you have to live like this. Eddie, there's so much money in this world. There's so much money. And there're so many different ways to get it. Stealing? Yes, stealing. But everybody in this whole stinking world is a thief. The prez, the priest, the whole public! Eddie, you know the one thing we have in common with the kings and the lions of the whole world? We're all thieves. I'm retired, Walter. Clean. I figure on stayin' that way. Eddie, how old is the little sprout? Shut up! 'Just so that--' 'I told you to shut up!' Alright, Walter. Out with it. And forget the snow job. - I have an offer. - 'Make it.' You're kidding. No. El vero,the truth. Upfront, $50,000. 'For what?' 'You want me to jump off the world?' Oh, no, no, Eddie. One night's work, that's all. One night! With that kind of bread you can buy ten super cannons. Oh, I want Eddie. Okay, you've made the offer. My answer is no. 'Now, you can leave.' Well, what kind of rudeness is this in my own brother's house? Did I bring you to this country no questions asked when mama died? Brothers never stop owing brothers! Get out of my house. Get out! Oh, well. Never thought I'd live to see the day. You've lived it. I need you, Eddie. I don't need you. You heard? I heard. Let's go. Say, Eddie, uh, if you got a hard-boiled egg in your lunch I'll trade it for some celery with cheese in it. - I got a cavity. - Yeah? Freeze. Squeeze him down. He's clean. Okay, Pedak, get in the car. - You're the boss man? - Yeah. Jack, call my wife. Just say one word. Vido. Alright, break it up, you guys, come on. Come on, let's go. Knock off the goofball talk, Pedak. - Speak Gringo. - Alright. How can you justify this one? Planning on losing me another job, is that it? No. No, this time it's different. This time I'm gonna shove you into the gas chamber. We shall overcome.. Cell number one. Hey, Luke! Eddie, baby. What's happenin', man? Last time I saw you, you were playing basketball on the San Quentin team, right? I've been clean. How long you been out? Four months, barely enough time to get a good high, you know. - Are you holding any straights? - Yeah. They burned me for my Zig-Zags at the gate. Gracias,baby, gracias. Mm...it really is a straight. - What'd they get you for? - Ah.. Phony roust. 48-hour hold. Ain't that a wiggy charge? - Yeah. - Hey, you guys in number one. - You got any butts? - No! - 'What about your partner?' - He ain't got nothin', man. I hear that murderers toss around at night. That true, Luke? I wouldn't know, Mr. Vido. Tell me about your pad, Luke. It's just a pad. You were there last night? - Yeah. - And what about this girl? Is she shacked up with you? No, she was just like a twitch. Like, she just hung around a lot, you know. Hmm. Did she scream? Well, it's on paper, the twitch was gagged. 'How could she scream?' How do you know she was gagged? I saw it on television. You are a liar. You are a sick liar. Your place, a shooting gallery. Oh, if they wanna shoot a bit.. ...that's their bag, not mine. I'm clean. Check my lines. Just boo, grass, juice, straight.. You know? And what about your legs? Well, what about 'em? They got hits and your pins look IBN cards. You haven't got a vein in your frame. That is a nice line, Mr. Vido. Do I qualify then? Ah, yeah, you do. Now, tell me about the women in your pad. Uh, a twitch cacks in my pad, it don't make me responsible. I make the rent upfront. What the dykes do, uh that's their bag, not mine. A girl died in your gallery last night. She was tied down and gagged and overshot. Now, I say you're responsible. What do you say? C'est la vie,Mr. Vido. And you're a killer, Luke.. '...with intent!' Go on, get him outta here. They might abolish extreme penalty, Mr. Vido. Lots of heavy cats are workin' on it, you know? Out. Jack Parr is workin' on it too. 'Get him out.' How long you been working at O'Hare's, Pedak? Ten months, ever since my last roust when you had a talk with my other boss. Was that an accusation, Eddie? No, just the truth. Well, that's a tough break, huh? Yeah. When was the last time you saw your brother, Eddie? Hmm? About five years ago. How about, uh, Cleveland Shoenstein? James Arthur Sargatanas? The same. About five years. Which one was with you during that grocery stick-up? I don't know what you're talkin' about. You don't? Two men stuck-up Wing's grocery store. One of 'em was wearing a sheepskin coat. Described as six feet tall and dark and his name was Eddie. You. And you shot and killed a woman. - It's a frame! - You're nailed, kid! It's a frame! We've got a finger. 'The one you missed.' Go ahead, Charlie. Okay, did you get a good look at him? - Sure, okay. - Good. Now, which man was it? No. What do you mean "No?" No. You mean the man isn't there? No, not there. Well, look at 'em. Take another look. The man is not those. Uh, man number four. Step forward! Look at him. - Go on, look at him. - That's enough, Vido. A man named Eddie drives a Model A Ford was wearing a sheepskin coat. Are you gonna sit there and tell me that that isn't the man-- I saw the man who killed my wife and not him. You made it. 'Step off.' Pedak! Out of the line! Your witness had no make. What's holding me now? Your arresting officer I'm gonna hold you the full 48 hours. - Release the prisoner. - As his-- I said release the prisoner. That's an order. Release him. - I warned you, Vido. - I was sure that I had a-- You were sure the other time you hounded Pedak, you were sure. Don't ever let this happen again. Yes, sir. What are you thinking? You, me.. ...a lot of things. You know, in Mexico they allow the wives to visit their men in jail. Jail. It's another world. A world I almost forgot. Vido tried to frame me. It was a hell of a job. Almost perfect. The witness, everything. Come on, don't be so gloomy. So, O'Hare's won't take you back. You can get another job, baby. Yeah, and another and another and Vido will come and blow each one. Just like always. - Maybe if, if I get a job-- - No. But, if you don't start work right away.. I'll get the money. It's my job, not yours. Don't do that. Just stop it. Like me? I hate you. I hate you too. 'Mommy.' What is it, honey? 'I want a drink of water, please.' Your little girl wants water. - I'd better get her some. - Ah, yeah, you'd better. - I'll be right back. - Oh, yeah. Daddy, I don't like you going fishing. Daddy, I miss you. Mm, I missed him too. In a minute. You think Kathy is asleep? You want a cigarette? You know what I want. Mm-hmm. Kathy is still awake. That man I told you about. Luke, back in jail. What about him? I could be right where he is now waitin' in a cell. Waiting for Vido to come and get me to shove me into the gas chamber. I was just like Luke once.. ...before I met you. Are you glad you met me? Miss Hampton, will you giftwrap those tackle boxes? I'll make out the cards myself. - Who's the guy waitin'? - Pedak. Came over to us in the Paintbrush Makers Union about a year ago. Hi. 'O'Hare doesn't want him back.' 'All these come under the $25 gift deductibles.' - Great, isn't it? - Yeah. He's got a record. Oh, he's not bonded then, huh? No. All we've got now is for bonded men only. You know, how tight things are right now. Senator Fox isn't a fisherman. I gotta find somethin' else for him. This is very difficult, George. We've got four and five-year men out of work. Talk to him, smooth it over, you know the routine. Yeah. Come on in, Eddie. Right over here. Hi, Eddie. What's new? Not much. I'm lookin' for some work. Can you help me? I can't use another man. Have you tried any of the big boats? Yeah. They have full crews. Yeah, we're all into getting on a big boat havin' a small of your own. I'll be through in a minute, stick around and I'll pop the beers. No, thanks. I have to get home. My wife starts a job tonight. I'm sorry I have to leave the dishes, honey. Eddie. It won't be for long. You're pretty, mommy. Now, you be a good little girl and you take good care of your daddy, alright? You never went to work before. Things are different now. Eddie? I have to go. Then go. Don't forget to get Kathy in bed by00. How long is your vacation, daddy? I don't know, why? - Can I help? - No! Mommy always lets me help. She lets me stand on the chair and wipe the dishes. I'm not your mommy! Oh, come on. A lotta little things that have bein' tossed into the pot tonight. I can smell it. It-it stinks in my brain, my intuition. Here, look at this. Report from the tale of the night of the Wing killing. I had an Imperial sedan stopped at Pedak's house. First report from DMV in Sacramento. - New registration filing. - Walter Pedak. Eddie lied about not seeing his brother. Ah, there were three men in that car that night and I'll bet you anything that the three were Shoenstein, Sargatanas, and brother Walter. Mike, if the lieutenant knew about this he'd blow a gasket. Well, this doesn't mean anything right now but it will and it's gonna be baitin'. Walter and his boys don't fool around with any penny ante stickups. 'Mike, you're never gonna get departmental cooperation' on a thing like this. You know what I'd like to do? I'd like to get that whole damn bunch put 'em into a room, one by one.. Vido? Dan. Couldn't you sleep? It's30. The girl that brought me home wanted to stop for coffee. I couldn't tell her not to, could I? No. I guess not. Oh, Eddie, please. Please. Let's not fight, alright? Where's your ring? They don't want me to wear it. It's for tips, look. Look, I got $20 tonight. For pushin' hamburgers? Well, you don't like the money? What about the $1,000 due on the boat? And the other $500 you might lose? All of a sudden you don't like money? You're gonna quit that job. And do what? Sit around and watch you stalk around the house? Honey, what are we supposed to use for money? I'll get it! And when I do, you're gonna quit that stupid job. You're gonna stay home and wear the ring. - You understand that? - Eddie, I was only trying-- Now let me sleep. I have to get up early for Kathy and for my household duties. You tryin' to get on the rocking chair? - Mm? - Unemployment! Yeah, I've been here since 10 o'clock. Mm. You think we got troubles. Look at this poor dude. He'll get the chair. 'Yeah, he killed some woman.' 'Did you read the story?' Yeah, I remember it on TV. He'll get the chair for sure 'cause he's a broker. Loser. 'A nobody.' 'It's guys like him and you and me.' 'We get the chair.' Now, the guys who run the game.. ...they only do a couple years. Pedak! Edward Pedak. - Fred, lunch? - Yes. Ron! Sorry to have kept you waiting. Then why did you keep me waiting? A question has come up about your eligibility for payments, Mr. Pedak. I had to do a little checking. You understand, of course. Now, in order for you to become eligible for unemployment compensation, you have to have been laid off. But according to your boss, Mr. Olden you quit your job at O'Hare's. Now, you're eligible, but not immediately. you'll have to file. I quit? Uh, reason for severance employee walked off job without notice. Where does it say that? That isn't true. I was fired. I'm telling you, I was fired. Look, Mr. Pedak. This is a problem between you and your former employer. If you like, we can call in and you'll have an opportunity to discuss it. Listen to me. I was fired. Why do you believe them, not me? Just a minute. Mr. Pedak, if you like, you may have the opportunity of discussing your problems with my supervisor. I have the opportunity to discuss it with you, now! - Oh, look here-- - No, you look. I came here cleanly dressed, ready for work. Just like it says in the rules. I filled out all the papers just like it says in the rules. I don't want your money. I want a job. But if you can't give me a job then I want my check. Just like it says in the rules. There's nothing more I can do, Mr. Pedak. - You don't seem to understand. - I do understand! That's the trouble. I've put my money into this organization every week I ever worked. You took it from me. And now I want what's coming to me. Yeah, but if you quit your job-- I didn't, damn it! I didn't! Will you listen to me? Believe me. Just look at me once. The next time you draw your paycheck I want you to think about the poor slobs that you keep waiting and give the run around to. I want you to think about it. Mr. Pedak. Is this me? Are all these papers supposed to be me? See, it's that easy. I'm no longer there. I no longer exist. So go eat your lunch. Hey, wait a minute. Sorry, sir, but you do show a violation. You can mail-in the two dollars, sir. Good day. No wonder I couldn't see it. - Eddie! - Yeah. I'm supposed to be babysitting. Then why aren't you? Well, he told me it was okay to leave. Hey, you! Babysitter! I got too much brain workin' best and this time you punks blow it. Oh, dear. Oh, hey, hey, here. Here, here, hold it there, hold it. Let me see. Put it inside here against the gum like this. Now, bite down with your teeth. Bite. Hard! Bite! Hey, you know, with-with all the dough you're gonna get you know what, you can buy yourself a new set of teeth. Platinum teeth. - Are you alright? - Mm. What did you do? Why did you jump on Sargatanas for? I was just watching the little sprout dance. What did we come back here for anyway? Yeah, why don't you get off my back, huh? Like I told you, I need you. I got a job, a big one. Why don't you just loan me two grand, brother? I'm a businessman. You gimme one-night's work, I'll give you 50 grand. Why him? We're gonna hit O'Hare's.. ...for one million bucks. Huh? And you know the layout, the vault, the guards and everything in there. - You're out of your mind. - No, I'm not. In O'Hare's vault.. ...they got a million bucks of platinum in wire under the spools and this whole thing fits into a couple little suitcases. It's there right now but in a few days they're gonna piece it-- Forget it. Forget it, forget it. Forget it! Fifty grand, Eddie. Fifty grand for one night's work. That's more than your wife can make.. ...hustlin' in that joint she's in now. Is Kristine here? Kristine? - Oh, you mean, Kitty? - Yeah, Kitty. She's over there. Hello, Kitty. Hey, now, what's the idea-- Don't cheat the customers, Kitty. Let them see it all. - Please stop. - Get out! Oh, no! Get out! No, no, please stop. - Why.. - No! Please, no! - Why you.. - No! No! No! - Get in! - Oh. Market District. I'm in. I want money now. Drive. Are you coming to bed? Eddie, how many times do you want me to say it? I'm sorry about tonight. Aren't you gonna talk to me? There's nothing to talk about. I'm working now. Oh, Eddie, I don't like it. Then why don't you call a cop? Oh, Eddie, let's leave town. Go to another state, change our name. Huh, you want me to break parole? Well, anything's better than what you're planning to do. Honey, you can get another job. And then what? Vido comes and throws me in the slam again and it'll go on. Just like it has for the past six years. I've had it. All of it! Oh, it's all my fault. It's everybody's fault. Now, go to bed. Eddie, I'm sorry about tonight. Sorry doesn't help! Doesn't change anything! Doesn't get me a job and doesn't get us out of here. Well, then I'm not sorry about tonight. I was only doing my best to help. - You sure were. - You won't let me help! You don't even let me be your wife! What do you want me to do, Eddie? Just let me alone. Okay! Okay! You're alone! Get out! A friend of the deceased, sir? You're John Ling? I'm Eddie Pedak. Oh, yes, sir. Your group is in the rear. Eddie. Eddie, meet the pitman. You bring the stuff? It's all there. All that I know. We go tonight. You have the equipment? It's at the Chinese cemetery in my family vault. You think there's a bomber in the vault? The moment I blow the gate, poof! Gas. I've got enough masks. What about the hook up? Direct to the Atlas Protection Agency and the guard gate has a direct hotline. That's the tricky part. Yeah, but I have some tricks too. Here, here's the terminal box right here in the yard. Eddie, you take that first. Cleve, you used to be a signal-call man, huh? You teach Eddie how to splice. I'll teach you lotsa things. - 'How many guards are there?' - Two. How long before the heat arrives? I figure, uh, maybe, three, four minutes after the blow. The heat gets there before the three minutes the O'Hare yard's gonna look like the O.K. Corral. Then we move faster! Push, pull, click, click, man, that big. That's my old gun. That's right. Now, here's where we park the panel truck, here. This is where the gate is. I park my car outside, across the street. The Atlas car comes behind me. Ling, you ride in the panel. Now, let's go over this step by step. There isn't gonna be any time to make mistakes. That car, wha.. What's on it? Oh, stolen vehicle, been here, oh, coup-three days. And then Ling says to this man, he says "Now, what do you mean, am I Italian when you just hear me talkin'?" And this old guy, he says, "Well, yeah but that's why I thought you were Chinese." I'll go check on the equipment. - I'll see you later. - See you. Bon bene, huh? I want to talk to you. Alright. I'll be back, huh? Hey, wasn't.. Eddie? It's gonna go good tonight. Yeah, at least with the planning you haven't lost your touch. Eddie, what is that supposed to mean? Shh. Come on. Eddie. You know when you were busted, sent up.. ...they were the only family I had for eight years. They're like vultures, Walter. Sittin' on your shoulder and waiting for you to make one slip. There's not gonna be a slip. You know.. ...this is the last job I'm gonna do. I'm tired. I wanna retire. Eddie. I'm gonna go home, back to Trieste. What're you gonna do? It's a big ocean.. ...and I've got a fishing boat. I thought we could be together. The vultures are beginning to smell blood. I want you to think about it. 'I'm almost done with Snoopy.' 'He got blue eyes.' 'Now, I'm drawing his tail.' - 'He got a green tail.' - Vido. 'Snoopy is always sleeping on top of the house.' 'I can draw houses' 'but I can't draw doghouses.' Hello, Eddie. You got a warrant? No. Then get out of my house. Yeah, that's Snoopy. And this the way he looks-- Don't bother Mr. Vido right now, honey. Daddy has to talk business. Here, draw over here. Can you draw me a, umm.. ...horse now? Sure. A red one. Oh, don't let me hold up your dinner, Missus, uh, Pedak. You didn't come here to admire my daughter's drawings. No. That's right I didn't. You remember the Legno job? Ha, you back on that one? Eddie, I want you to cop-out to me. I promise you there won't be any roust. No fireworks. Just a simple cop-out. The courts ruled I didn't do it. Now, say what you came here to say. This was taken from me. Mmm? And this was taken from the body of Lisa Wing. They match perfectly, Eddie. Both bullets were fired from the same gun. Here.. ...read this. I marked the spot. What is it? It's a hot-car sheet. A Model-A like yours was stolen in Marin County the morning before the Wing hold-up and killing. 'And there was a sheepskin coat on the front seat.' I told you I was framed for it! I know, and I think you know who it was. - I don't know nothing. - Eddie, talk! I told you, I don't know nothing. You're lying, and you lied when you said you hadn't seen your brother. Walter was here that night and so was Sargatanas 'and Shoenstein.' Here's your horse, Mr. Vido. It's for you. That's great. You're not as smart as I gave you credit for. Something's happening, something big and you're right in the middle of it. But I don't think you really know where you are. Thanks for your time, tough guy. Ah, if you change your mind-- I'll call you. Yeah, do that. Goodnight, Mrs. Pedak. For God's sake, tell him, he's trying to give you a chance. Shut up. Give me that gun. Your brother gave you that, didn't he? - Answer me! - I don't want to talk about it. Oh, Vido's right. You are too stupid for words. Your own brother tries to frame you for a murder and you just sit there, and you say nothing. - What do you think of it? - Out! I can see that, but I wanna know where. I told you I am going out. That's all, period. Eddie? This isn't like you. How would you know? You've only known me six years. So, don't say what's like me and what isn't. Vido knows me. Walter knows me. And that poor character waiting to die, Luke he knows me, and I know me. I'm a thief, so I'm going out. To steal? Isn't that what thieves do? I'll call you tonight. It'll be late. Pack what you want and bring Kathy down to the boat. After tonight we won't have to stay in this town anymore. Suppose we don't come? You're a little late. Ever heard of Lisa Wing? Eh? I've heard of her. I buried her. Well, who's Lisa Wing? A women killed in a hold-up. Two guys pulled the job. 'One was wearing a sheepskin coat..' Like mine. They made off in a Model A.. Like mine. Someone tried to frame me for murder. Eddie, you got a dirty mind. You geezed up zombie. Don't trigger anything now. Not now! Come on, it's time. The Atlas guards are making their early check. - We've got one hour now. - I mean it! What luck! We got one million bucks at stake. That's all that counts. Nothing else. You don't know if they did it. You know they framed me-- So what you want me to do right now? What do you want? Bang, bang, bang. Hey! Hey, Benny. What was that? Bottle crashing, sounded like. Hey, Benny. What'd you do that for? I better call. Yeah! 'Hello, Mort?' Is Artie beatin' you at Gin? You better shoot Bill and Al out here. There's trouble in the yard. Well, I will do it, Jack. Al's in the neighborhood right now. I'll telephone him. It won't take a minute. Okay. See you later. They're on their way. Ah, they're here. Better heat up the coffee, for those two java hounds. Heh-heh-heh. 'I'm coming.' Hold your horses. - Don't move. - Now, listen, man-- Shut up, in the office, make it fast. No sugar. Move. On your bellies. Hands behind your back. Walter. One less split. You drive. Turn left here. Turn right at the next alley. Go on up. Ditch the truck and contact me at Ling's. Stay away from them. Now, relax, Eddie. I just pulled the biggest gig on the coast. I won, eh? Hey! I can still take care of myself, huh. Okay, okay, you win. Hey, call me as soon as you can. Walter? 'Estimates losses at over one million dollars.' 'The gang concentrated on light white spools of platinum wire..' 'Nothing was stolen, but the platinum.' Kris? Meet me at the boat right away. No. I won't. Be there. '...explode teargas' 'in the event of robbery.' 'and its doors broken open' 'by nitroglycerin.' 'The gang left behind gas masks' 'which they had apparently used during the--' Anything? Not a mark. I wasn't expecting any breaks. - 'It was Pedak.' - Oh, come on, Vido. Lieutenant, both guards gave positive identification. They remembered him, he worked here. The second man they saw fits the description of James Sargatanas. I figure the other two to be Walter Pedak and Cleve Shoenstein. Who's that guy on the ground? That, I don't know. Put it out for the Pedaks, Sargatanas, and Shoenstein. Mike? Where are you two going? - Pedak. - No, you're not. You're way over your shift already, both of you. - 'I'll take it from here.' - Uh, lieutenant-- Mike, I mean it. Check-in in the morning. Go home. Get some sleep. Now, how stupid can a guy be. 'See any persons fitting the descriptions' 'contact the San Francisco Police Department.' 'All men are armed and considered dangerous.' 'Walter Pedak..' 'And now the news.' 'At the top of tonight's headlines is the daring robbery' 'of an estimated one million dollars' 'worth of platinum. From the..' 'Eddie.' You cheap crook! Use a gun! Kill me, will you? You rotten bastard! Kill me! Kill me! - Kill me! - Kris. What's happened? - They took Kathy-- - What's happened? - They took Kathy. - Who? - Who was it? - Sargatanas. Listen, listen. - He say anything to you? - No! - Anything at all? - No! - She's alright. - No. She's alright, I know what he wants. - She's alright. - Why should I believe you? Listen. I'll get her back. - I promise you. - I don't want any promises! - Listen! - I want my baby. I want her back. Listen! Listen to me! Don't, don't move. No! Stay here. Stay near the phone. I'll call you, I promise. I'll do everything right. I promise. I promise. No! - Yeah. - You've seen the papers? Your brother's wanted for snuffin' the gook. Where's my kid? Is she alright? She's here. I would've called you sooner but I wanted her to have her Z's. Growing sprout needs plenty of Z's, heh? I want to talk to her. Hmm. Cleve. Kid, you wanna talk to your daddy? - Yes. - Uh-huh. Playing a game you see. Here, speak at ease. Hello, daddy? Hello, kitten. Are you playing a game with Uncle Jimmy? Sure. A-a game. That's enough for now, we'll play the game some more later. - Oh, boy. - Let's finish your cornflakes. You think I'm a bad guy. What I think is.. ...you're valuable. Hard to replace. I've got the platinum you wanted. - I want my kid. - Hmm. You're a reasonable dude. Give me a number where I can reach you. Why not now? Listen, I-- Oh, no. You're gonna have to sweat a bit, Charlie. Give me your number. Wait a minute. Contact me at Mission 71999. I'll call you in half an hour. Eddie! It's alright, I just talked with Kathy on the phone. But I want her now. I want Kathy back. Why doesn't he give her back to me? - Well, take it easy, I-- - I can't wait any longer. Well, I mean it, Eddie, if-if you don't get her back to me you're gonna regret it, all of it. I mean it, Eddie. I told you, I'll get her back. I'm not gonna wait forever. Where will you be? Where they'll never think of looking for me. Si? Oh, is your son there? Uh, uh, sorry. I-I no speak English. It's loaded. You got a warrant? Come on in and sit in that chair. And move slow. Oh, mama, cappuccino. Grazie. Would you mind not blasting me while my mother's in the room? Are you always so funny in the morning? You really think that you can walk into my house carrying a gun and get to walk out again? I hope to. Uh-huh. Well, kid, I never said you didn't have guts. Where are the rest of the boys? Where are your playmates? My brother's dead. Sargatanas killed him. You're worried you're next on his list? No. I've got the platinum. All of it. And you crossed Sargatanas? You know, you do have a right to look worried. Not for myself. Sargatanas kidnapped my daughter last night. Has he made contact? Yes. This morning. He's going to call me again. I can't deal, Eddie. I don't want a deal. I'm asking you.. ...to help me get my kid back. I'll give you everything. The loot, Sargatanas and Shoenstein. - And you? - And you get me too. So you want police protection while you swap-- No! No cops. Just you. Why me? I trust you. Alright. I'll do it, on one condition. Name it. Uh, no, I'm, uh, I'm clean. The Legno job. It was you that shot me that night, wasn't it? Yeah. It was me. And it's funny I think about this for years it eats at me inside. And, now, it's silly. So, now, I know! Big deal, huh? I was a nervous kid. Yeah, and I guess I was.. Thanks. I guess I was tryin' to be some kind of a hero or something. I better get dressed. Sargatanas. It's for me. - Yeah? - 'Okay, daddy.' - 'Where's the stuff?' - Alright. Fisherman's Wharf. - 'Wong restaurant--' - No. In front of the Sausalito Cafe. - 'Good place for a million--' - That's right. The stuff is close by. The wharf, where your boat is? You know everything I do, don't you? Listen, if there's any cops crawlin' around-- Don't worry. I'll stick to my end of the deal. We don't have much time. Hello? Yes, I'd like to speak to.. I'd like to speak to Inspector Vido, please. Inspector Vido's desk. No, ma'am, he isn't here right now. This is his partner, Inspector Kane. May I help you? Who? It's Pedak's wife. No! No, I don't know where Eddie is. Listen, look! Will you listen to me? You don't understand! All I want is my daughter back. Now, don't worry, Mrs. Pedak, You've done the right thing. I want my daughter back! I've been waiting all night! Please? I don't know where he is. Please? Now, you stay there. Yes, I'll come myself. There's my daddy! There's my daddy! Daddy, look what Uncle Jimmy gave me. Do we start the game now? In a minute, honey. Where's the stuff? Let her go first. Mm, why should I? Let her go. And you've still got me. Kitten. Do you know where daddy's boat is from here? Yes, down there. Alright, so you go and run down there. Mommy's there. She wants to see you. She's waiting for you. Okay? Now, do as daddy told you. - Will you be long? - No. As soon as you get to mommy daddy'll start the game, okay? Take the gun out, toss it in the car. Lead the way. - Mrs. Pedak? - Yes. Mommy, mommy, mommy! Mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy! - Uh, oh, baby! - Mommy, mommy, mommy! - See what Uncle Jimmy gave me-- - Baby! Mrs. Pedak, let me talk to the baby. No, leave us alone. Mrs. Pedak, please? - Leave us alone! - I have to find out-- All I wanted was my daughter back! - Mrs. Pedak, please-- - Leave us alone! - Let me talk to the baby. - Baby! No! No, Kathy, don't tell.. Where is it? In the truck. Now, where's your daddy, huh? They're-they're playin' a game with Uncle Jimmy. And daddy said I could play too. Well, I'd like to play a game too. Why don't you show me where they are and we'll all play together? Okay, go ahead. Pedak's around here somewhere.. It's there. The end of the rainbow. Long cars, and, and beautiful women. I don't dig women. It's your turn. Sargatanas! I fixed it. Eddie! Frank, no! Eddie! No! Daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy! You're supposed to close them, daddy. Oh, no! You alright? Why in the hell did.. Stand back, everybody. Stand back. Make way, please. Stand back. 'Get back.' Mrs. Pedak..
