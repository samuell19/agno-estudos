CHAPTER ONE: MAN You... Do you understand what I'm doing? Be quiet... Please...help me... Hey! Keep still. Please...don't...please... Fuck me if that's what you want. I'll do whatever you want. I won't say anything about this to anyone. Do you... ...understand what I'm doing? I understand that you are strong. I like a guy like you. Do you want me? Yes, I want you to fuck me. You're a strong guy. I want it now. Please come... ...inside me. I... I won't come inside you. What a filthy mouth. I'll shut your mouth up. Fucking bitch. Nobody... Understands... How can he do such a thing anyways? I kinda understand him. Really? I can't believe it. Isn't he so creepy? You think so? You just don't understand a man's heart. No I don't. - Oh, yeah? No, tell me about it. Well... Men are not that strong. I know you think they are... And sometimes you can lean on them. That's what girls think. Exactly. -Yep. And that's what we want. -Yep. But, the truth is...the complete opposite. Men are weak. Even Pro Wrestlers. Pro Wrestlers? -Boxers and Martial arts fighters... Them too. -What do you mean? They turn into little kitty cats when they are with girls. Kitty cats? -Exactly. Men are weak, but you expect us to be strong. So, we keep pretending we are. Am I making you tired? Good evening. Would you like some hot Oden? HELL Hey...Look at me. Hey...Come on turn around. What are you watching? Please, don't ignore me. What's wrong? Why are you watching this? One of the bitches I killed today... Asked me to fuck her. What a nasty bitch. But, she was saved by you. So, she's fine now. Well... Where is she now? I dumped her. That's... Too bad. Do I really want to fuck? Don't even say that. You know the answer. Did you forget what you taught us? What's that? You taught us how to find what true love is. You are the one who guided us. So we will keep our eyes only on you. We will love only you. Right... You all will love only me. That's right. Only you. Only me... You must let many more bitches know that you're... Hey... I'm what? Come on. That I'm what? Hey! Say it! Hey! Answer me! What am I! What must I let them know!? Tell me! I... What am I? Do you understand what I'm doing? Shut up American bitch! Don't touch me, you fucking freak! Nobody understands. I'll fucking kill you! Do you feel my power? Do you feel my pain? Do you feel my anger? Do you feel me, you fucking bitch!? Nobody... Understands... CHAPTER TWO: WOMAN It's OK... ...isn't it? HELL Hey, hey, hey... Nice. Aloha, hello there. Well, well... Found a cutie at last. It's so cool getting to know each other. I like the fresh feelings. Allow me to sit here and please listen. I'm getting high now... You're just my perfect woman. You're gorgeous even when you look unhappy. Let's do some love experiments together. A wonderful weekend with you. You're beautiful really. I'm really happy to meet a woman like you. I wish I could be that scarf. Wouldn't that be funny? So... I have a motorcycle. It's cold so I wore two leather jackets. And then my neck couldn't turn. It was kind of thrilling. Well, that's my presentation for now... Rei? Men and women are completely different living beings. Do you think they ever really understand each other? Well, maybe... Do you think it's the same with us? No way, we're alright. Because I understand you. Everything about you. What! Really? Are you sure? -Yes. I doubt it. -I do. You do? -Yes. Well...for instance... I know what's on your mind right now. Really? -Yeah. So what am I thinking? "This is a boring conversation". Right. You see? Told ya! -So let's talk about something funny. Yeah, I can do that. Am I the only one who wants to say "Bae Yong Joon" sometimes? I don't. -You don't? Bae Yong Joon. I see. The ocean is beautiful... Because it's blue. What? That drink. It looks like a beautiful ocean. This? What if the ocean wasn't blue... Maybe red instead... How would we feel? Red? Would we feel as relaxed as we do with a blue one? If not, it means we don't feel relaxed because of the ocean itself... But, it's the color I guess. But... If... The ocean was red... We would be wondering... About what? "If the ocean was blue... How would we feel?" Actually, I was just wondering what cocktail you were drinking. This one? Wanna try? No, no you don't have to do that. But... If you say so. Shit, I just did it. Did what? I, Ryuhei, just made the first sin ever in my life... What? Drunk driving... Actually... Not the first time. Thinking about myself, I've already been evil. I've betrayed many people... Made them sad... And made them cry. I've been selfish and... Lived my life the way I wanted to. I think... Everybody's like that. You tink so? You too? After being so selfish... Everyting comes back to me. That's life. Every time, I thought I could do better than the last time... I lost the energy to go on little by little. It's strange... What is? My words are coming out... Very naturally. Are you... Trying to make me the next person to cry for you? For now, I don't know. But, I just can't imagine you crying. There you go. I might not succeed this time. But... That's why I feel good. Maybe... Hey. What? Let's go somewhere. What? Where? Somewhere... ...I can completely disappear. I'm sorry. I just said something strange, too. I understand. It's the ocean. It's a great view in the daytime. But, not at night. It's dark. The ocean... It's black. Are you OK? I feel... A little strange. So do I. You do? When I look at you... I feel like I'm looking at myself. And I can't be calm. I don't know what to do. Take your time. I want you to accept me. I think... I can do the same for you. Listen... I... Actually... Actually I'm... What? Keep going. Let it all out. I'll accept it all. You don't want to have any regrets. It's all over now. You've been killing... Many men, so brutally. There are people who can't do their business. You know what that means? This color... Beautiful isn't it? This pure red... Is my color. Yours too. Right? I'll set you free. I'll accept all of you. So cute... Everybody's the same. Painful... Isn't it. It's painful, getting fucked. It's OK. It's OK. Right? Isn't it? CHAPTER THREE: MAN AND WOMAN What? Isn't that great? That's what I was about to say. Really? That's awesome! Our souls must be connected. Isn't that a bit creepy? -Don't say it like that. I believe that it is destiny. You do? Aren't we just two of a kind? For sure! We are meant to be together. -What makes you so sure? Tell me. -The answer to that... We just meet here, it's our destiny. Oh, it's that easy? -Believe me, I'm serious. You know that, right? No, you're not. That's not what she is saying. -You're so shallow and a playboy. Playboy? Yes, you are. Play... ...boy. You play with yourself? Fucking bitch... Do you... Understand what I am doing? You're... I'm... I'm just... I... I can't... Cum... Inside you... I know... I'm... Really... Wanting to... It's OK. Now you are... Inside me... I can feel you inside me. It's... It's OK... You will be... OK... It's OK... Right? Isn't it?
