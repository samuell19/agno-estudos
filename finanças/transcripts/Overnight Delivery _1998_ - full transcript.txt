I CAN DO THIS ON MY OWN! BECAUSE I'M A MAN, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE! NOT A BARE-ASSED BABY. TRIPS! TRIPS! GET LOST! TRIPS! BEAT IT! TRIPS, GET IN THE CAR. BUT IF I'M GOING TO CHAUFFEUR YOUR COOKIES TO DES MOINES SO WE CAN CATCH THAT PLANE, WE HAVE TO LEAVE NOW, ALL RIGHT? BESIDES, THE WHOLE IDEA IS TO KEEP YOUR PANTS ON UNTIL YOU SEE KIMBERLY. THEN YOU CAN TAKE THEM OFF. COME ON, HOP IN THE CAR. BACKSEAT MAKES A HELL OF A CHANGING ROOM. Sleeper: * JUSTIN, YOU * * SPARKLE LIKE A JEWEL * * TURN YOUR FACE TO ANOTHER FACE * * YOU STARTED OUT WITH ME AT SCHOOL * * WE MOVE AWAY * * 'CAUSE YOU'RE COMING THROUGH * * IS YOUR SKIN LIKE SOME OTHER SKIN? * * OR IS IT THIN AND NAVY BLUE? * * OH, PAINT ME * * LIKE SOMEBODY PAINTED YOU * DON'T--DON'T SAY A WORD. OK, ACCORDING TO THE MAP, WE JUST STAY ON 35 SOUTH. IT'LL TAKE US STRAIGHT INTO IOWA. Ivy: YOU'RE KIDDING? WHAT HAPPENED? Trips: WE DECIDED TO WAIT UNTIL WE GOT MARRIED. OH, WE DECIDED, OR SHE DECIDED? SHE DECIDED, BUT, YOU KNOW, I SUPPORTED THE DECISION. I BELIEVE IN A DEGREE OF CELIBACY. A DEGREE? LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. I AM DRIVING YOU 250 MILES TO STOP A LETTER TO A GIRL WHO YOU INTEND TO MARRY, BUT WHO YOU'VE NEVER SLEPT WITH? SEX ISN'T EVERYTHING. OK, BUT EVERYTHING ELSE ASIDE-- THE MAGNET, THE LOVE LETTER, AND THE FLOWERS... ROSES. A DOZEN RED ROSES. WITH BABY'S-BREATH? OH, THAT'S NOT PREDICTABLE. WHEN ARE MEN GONNA UNDERSTAND THAT A WOMAN WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE A BUNCH OF HANDPICKED DAISIES WRAPPED IN A NAPKIN, RATHER THAN A DOZEN COMMERCIAL, GENERIC ROSES THAT THEY RECEIVE ON EVERY HOLIDAY? MOTHER'S DAY--ROSES. IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY-- ROSES. VALENTINE'S DAY--HMM... ROSES. TRIPS, REALITY CHECK. YOU'RE NEVER GONNA HAVE SEX WITH THIS GIRL. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. YEAH, I THINK I DO. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. A WOMAN KNOWS WITHIN THE FIRST 5 MINUTES OF KNOWING A GUY WHETHER OR NOT SHE WANTS TO SLEEP WITH HIM OR NOT. OH, AND I SUPPOSE THIS COMES FROM YOUR VAST EXPERIENCE WITH, UH, MATURE RELATIONSHIPS. WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? NOTHING. LET IT SLIDE. NO. ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT MY PROFESSOR HARLAN? YOUR SEX LIFE IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS. EXACTLY. EVEN IF I DO THINK YOU'RE MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE. OH, REALLY? HOW, IN YOUR WHIPPED ESTIMATION, AM I MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE? THESE TEACHER-STUDENT AFFAIRS ALWAYS END IN DISASTER. BUT IF YOU FEEL THE NEED TO SLUT AROUND-- SLUT AROUND? OH, OH. [TIRES SCREECH] LISTEN HERE, IF I WANT TO BAG A PROFESSOR FROM ONE OF MY CLASSES, I WILL, BUT NOBODY-- AND I DO MEAN NOBODY-- CALLS ME A SLUT. SO THE NEXT TIME YOU FEEL LIKE CASTING ASPERSIONS ON MY CHARACTER, TRY REMEMBERING THAT THIS QUOTE-UNQUOTE SLUT IS DRIVING YOUR JUDGMENTAL ASS ALL THE WAY TO DES MOINES, SO A LITTLE DECENCY WOULD BE IN ORDER. GOT IT? GOOD. LOOK, I'M, UH... I'M NOT EVEN THREATENING YOUR AIRLINE WITH A LAWSUIT. I'M NOT EVEN ASKING FOR REIMBURSEMENT. I JUST WANT TO GET ON THAT FLIGHT TO MEMPHIS. I KNOW, BECAUSE YOU'RE WYATT TRIPS, THE YOUNG MAN THAT KILLER BEEZ TOOK HOSTAGE THIS MORNING. WELL, IF YOU KNOW THAT, WHY ARE YOU GIVING ME SUCH A HARD TIME? [WHISTLES] COME ON, THE FLIGHT LEAVES IN 5 MINUTES. YOU ARE THE 26th COLLEGE KID I'VE HAD IN HERE TODAY MAKING THAT SAME CLAIM TO FAME. I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH NOTHING BUT UNDERGRADS ALL MORNING, EVER SINCE THE AIRLINE OFFERED A FREE ROUND-TRIP TICKET TO WYATT TRIPS AS A REWARD. NOW, UNLESS YOU HAVE SOME POSITIVE I.D... MADONNA... I'VE GOT PAYING CUSTOMERS TO TAKE CARE OF. BUT I AM WYATT TRIPS! AND... YOUR FLIGHT JUST LEFT. NEXT. [TYPING] [SLAMMING KEYS] Man: HI. MY NAME IS WYATT TRIPS. [CHUCKLES] OH, ISN'T THAT JUST GREAT? THAT'S AWESOME! OH, GOD! WELL, THAT WAS IT. THE LAST STRAW. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW IT OVER THERE, BUT, HEY, CHECK IT OUT--BANG! THERE GOES MY RELATIONSHIP. GONE! SEE YA! IT'S OVER! MY RELATIONSHIP IS OVER! LOOK AT ME. I'M DRESSED LIKE A GIRL. WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT FOR? THERE'S ANOTHER FLIGHT TO MEMPHIS OUT OF ST. LOUIS AT MIDNIGHT. OH. AWESOME. ST. LOUIS-- ONLY 400 MILES AWAY. GREAT! HOW THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO GET TO ST. LOUIS? RENT A CAR? WITH WHAT, SHELLS AND BEADS? ARE YOU ENJOYING YOURSELF? MAYBE I SHOULD TRY IT AGAIN. LOOK, I'LL GIVE YOU $200 IF YOU DRIVE ME TO ST. LOUIS. NO. 300. NO! I'LL LET YOU HIT ME AGAIN. MMM...NO. MAKE IT $400 FOR MENTAL ANGUISH, AND THEN MAYBE I'LL DO IT. ALL RIGHT. JESUS! OK. IT'S A DEAL, DONE. BUT LET'S GET 3 THINGS STRAIGHT. ONE--I AM NOT WHIPPED. 2--YOU'RE NOT A SLUT. 3--YOU MAY BE CUTE WHEN YOU'RE ANGRY, BUT YOU STILL HIT LIKE A 9-YEAR-OLD, SO GIVE ME THE KEYS. I'M DRIVING. I WAS WONDERING WHEN YOU WERE GOING TO COME TO YOUR SENSES. I JUST DIDN'T REALIZE WHAT I HAD NEXT TO ME. RIGHT IN THE CAR. GIMME A "T"! GIMME AN "R"! GIMME AN I-P-S! WHAT'S IT SPELL? TRIPS! LOUDER!

WHO ARE YOU CALLING? TRIPS, WHICH ONE OF THESE IS YOURS? THE ONE WITH THE PIG. [SNORTING] Operator: CAN I HELP YOU? I'D LIKE TO MAKE A CREDIT CARD CALL. NO, A COLLECT CALL.

WYATT TRIPS, YOU ARE SO DELUDED IT'S NOT EVEN FEASIBLE. OH HO, I DON'T THINK SO. WELL, I KNOW SO, AND YOU BETTER SAY YOU'RE WRONG BEFORE I HAVE TO THROW YOU OUT OF THE CAR. OH, SEE, I DON'T THINK YOU WILL. OH, YEAH? WHY NOT? BECAUSE YOU'RE SECRETLY IN LOVE WITH ME.

ONE FOR YOU TO MEMPHIS AND ONE FOR ME BACK TO SCHOOL. IS HE GOING TO BE PISSED? US TRAIPSING ALL OVER THE WORLD LIKE THIS? IT'S NOT THAT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP. YEAH, HE'S PROBABLY MATURE. READS BOOKS AND SEES FOREIGN FILMS. STUFF US UNDERGRADS HAVE ZERO INTEREST IN. I KNOW, TRIPS. YOU'RE THE EXCEPTION. NO, REALLY, YOU'RE A GOOD GUY. COMPLETELY FAITHFUL.

MY ROOMMATE RADITCH SAYS HI. HE HAD SOME ROOM LEFT ON HIS CREDIT CARD. YOU KNOW, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 24 HOURS, IT'S QUIET? NO HANGING OFF OF MOVING TRUCKS, NO BICKERING, NO HOSTAGE SITUATIONS. I MUST SAY, I'M GLAD WE GOT ARRESTED. THE IDEA THAT WE COULD HAVE STOPPED THAT PACKAGE BEFORE IT REACHED ITS DESTINATION WAS JUST-- WITHIN OUR GRASP. NOT REALLY. EXCEPT THAT ONE TIME. OH, MY GOD. YOU EVER HAVE ONE OF THOSE DAYS? WELL, I'M HAVING ONE OF THOSE DAYS. I THINK THE WORLD DOESN'T KNOW JELL-O FROM JOHNNY CAKES. YOU KNOW, SHERMAN-- WILLIAM TECUMSEH SHERMAN-- HE SAID, "WAR IS HELL." I DON'T BELIEVE IT. HE IS ONE DEDICATED PROFESSIONAL. IT STARTED OUT FINE. IT STARTED OUT GOOD. SUNNY, READY TO GO, SMILING, FIRST DAY. NOW I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN PULLED THROUGH A KNOTHOLE. WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT SOME KIND OF DISTRACTION. LIKE WHAT? WELL...OH, THANK YOU. MISS? THIS IS COLD. THERE'S STEAM RISING OFF THE PLATE. IT'S COLD STEAM. [SUCKING NOISES] I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
