Everyone is heading home under the crimson red clouds. Children, birds, trees, and plants... ...they all have supper waiting at home. However, a lone girl stands and gazes upon the distant sky. Her name is Ruriko. Look how lonely she seems. Before long, the stars light up the night sky... ...and the people slumber peacefully until the morning comes. Yet Ruriko is staring up at the sky, sadly from her window. Why hasn't Father sent me any letters? Unable to contain her sadness... ...Ruriko takes out the green music box her father bought for her. When Ruriko hears this melody, her dreams always take her to the skies. Ruriko! Ruriko! Ruriko! Come, Ruriko. Come to the world of stars. Close your eyes. Let the music box show you the way. Welcome, Ruriko The Moon Queen awaits you Good evening, everyone I am the very sad Ruriko Won't you play with me? Your father is a scientist... ...and after he left for Hokkaido... ...he hasn't sent a single letter in over a year. I know, so that's why you're so... Ruriko is so cute. Ruriko is so sad We understand what you are feeling Ruriko is so cute Ruriko is so sad Let's all comfort her With our song and dance Let's all call out to your father together. Ruriko's father! Ruriko's father! Hurry up Hurry up And come home And come home Ruriko, Ruriko! - What is it, Mother? - Ruriko... Your father is ill! The research director came all the way from Hokkaido... ...and he wants us to come with him to see your father. We must get packed right away. This is our daughter, Ruriko. My... You are a very cute little girl, Ruriko. The professor suddenly fell ill. It is not terribly serious... ...but he said he would like you to come. If you could get your things together... Yes, please excuse us. What is that, young lady? It's a music box. My father bought it for me. Sir, what is my father ill with? It's just a little cold. Nothing you need to worry about. Oh, but the station is that way. No, this way is fine. Are we not going to go by train? This is fine! Where are you taking us?! Just shut your traps already. - Giant, hurry. - Yes, sir. Mother, where are we? I don't know. This seems like Okutama. Quiet! Keep it shut! All right. Steady. Keep it coming. Good. Good. All right. What are you going to do to us? Shut up and do as we say! Come on. Get in. Go on. Are you surprised? You haven't seen anything yet. We built this all for the professor. He completed some amazing research here. My husband is here? But what did he do? As soon as he finished, he burned it all. On top of that, he went and got himself sick. Please let us see my father. All right, we'll let you see him. But in exchange, I want you to ask him about his secret research. If you do, we will take you and the professor back to Tokyo safe and sound. Okay. I'll plead with my father. So please, let us see him. Okay, okay. I'm glad to see how understanding you are. I'm sure you have a lot to discuss as a family. - Darling! - Father! What are you...? Ruriko... Why are you here? I should ask you the same thing. I was transferred here from Hokkaido last summer. Father, please. You have to give that man your research. Then we can all go back home to Tokyo. So that means Tazawa must have brought you here. Yes! That man is a foreign spy. What?! I... He deceived me into doing this research for him. If used for peace... ...it would bring this world much happiness. But as soon as I completed my research... ...I found out that they were foreign spies. That's why I burned all the documents on my research. But, Father, at this rate we'll... They may kill us. My poor family... But Ruriko, I cannot tell them what I know... ...even if it means sacrificing you two. I have to do what's best for all of humanity. You understand, don't you, Ruriko? I admire your resolve, Professor. But I promise to make you talk, even if it means killing your wife and daughter. Now, ma'am, let's get you plenty of rest. Take our guests to their cells. Yes, sir. Come on! - Ruriko! - Father! Father! Stop hurting me! Father! Ruriko... The poor girl. Wouldn't you say, Professor? It would be in both of our interest if you reconsidered. Why don't you sleep on it? I bought this for Ruriko... - Mother, I'm scared. - You poor thing. But Ruriko, your father can't give those men what they want... ...no matter what happens to him or to us. - You understand, don't you? - I do. - I understand. - Ruriko. Oh? Mother! It's Mother! Mother, Mother! Take this! If you don't tell us what we want soon... ...your wife and beautiful daughter won't be long for this world. Father! If you don't tell us now, your wife and daughter are as good as dead. Is that what you want? Boss, she's going to die if we go any further. Professor, you really won't talk? Not even if you kill me. Okay. - Come. - Yes, sir. Ruriko. Ruriko. Father! Ruriko... I'm done for. I can't go on much longer. Father, don't say that! You have to take my research and run. You have to run. My research... My research is inside there. What? Where? Father, where is it? Where is it? Write it down! M... U... S... I... C... B... O... X... Oh, it's in the music box! Hurry... You... have... to... run... Father! Father! Father! She finally blacked out. Oh... boss! She's dead! Father. I'm going now. Good-bye. Good-bye. Oh, no! Boss! Boss! Boss! Boss, the Professor is dead! What?! Hey! Where's the girl? Where did she go? Music box... Blast! He hid his research inside the music box! - Hurry up and go after the girl! - Yes, sir! Hey, wake up! What's taking so long? Okay, finally.

My name is Ruriko. - I'm Shorty. - I'm Fatty. I'm Bean Pole.

Let's go explore the spies' hideout tomorrow. Don't you dare! They'll kill you! Aw, we'll be fine. We do this, and we'll be able to bring back a good story for the other kids. Hey, I'm getting excited! I'm getting nervous. Hey, don't cry. I'll give you this. - You can have this from me. - And from me. Here. - Here you go. - Here. - You can have this too. - This too.

Where did you go? Shut up. Stop your crying. Mommy! Mom! Daddy! Boys shouldn't be crying. Hey, it's because you cried first. I guess I'm not the only orphan here. I'm sorry. I apologize. I won't cry anymore. So please let's be friends. Of course. All orphans have to stick together. That's just how it's been. Okay, well, the four of us are family now. Okay? Let's promise.

Come on, Fatty! They're getting on the elevator! We have to stop them! Wait... wait... Oh, no. They're already gone. What? What's going on? What's going on? I guess those rats didn't know we could control it from here. The rats decided to corner themselves for us! You'd better start praying because you're coming right back up here. What are we going to do? I guess we're all dead. We need to escape. All right, here. Use the pipe. Almost there. Come on, Ruriko. Hurry! Are you okay? Careful. Be careful, it's dark.

We made it. That was scary. Boss, boss... All right! - Here. - Thanks. Go! After that box! Hey. This way, this way! Do you know how far the river goes? It goes to Tokyo. Tokyo? Far off in the green Someone is calling you, inviting you The trains will go, the horses will go Carrying with them the dreams Where can I find this happiness? The traveling pigeon injures its wings And rain falls like blue ribbons Where is father, where is mother? Sing, my precious music box Where can I find this happiness? The city of buildings may be cold But the kind, blue sky peeks from above Don't cry, let us go We will go pick for flowers again today Where can I find this happiness? Hey, Fatty. Look. Hey, Shorty. Somebody weird is following us. What do you want? What a weirdo. Let's go. - What do you want? - I'm Mami. I left the countryside to go to Tokyo. - By yourself? - Yes. Does that mean you ran away from home? I suppose you could say that. Why do you want to go to Tokyo? - I want to see my mother. - Your mother? My mother is a singer in Tokyo. It is just me and my grandmother out in the country... ...that's why I'm going to find her. You poor thing. Hey, everyone, let's take her with us. - What do you think? - Fine by me! Us kids need to stick together. - All right, let's go then. - Yay! Welcome everyone, one and all! Our circus has come From beyond the Seven Seas! The scary lion had this to say: "I'm Cooper the lion." "Me can speak English, but my Japanese is no good!" Welcome everyone, one and all! Our circus has come bearing Many gifts from around the world The dancing tiger had this to say: "I'm Hepburn the tiger!" "I'm so over jazz!" "Can someone teach me traditional Japanese Bon Festival dance?" "The Bon Festival dance?" "That dance?" Now, now, now, now, welcome everyone, One and all Our wonderful circus has visited The North and South Poles, The Himalayas, and the Amazon The singing monkey had this to say: "I'm Mon the monkey!" "Hey, you can't just pick all the fleas." "Hey, these fleas are imported, I'll have you know!" Now, now, welcome everyone, One and all If your jaw drops to the floor, Please forgive us This is a circus, a very joyful circus A showboat of laughs and thrills What? You don't know? It's not like it's disappeared from this world. "I don't know" doesn't cut it! Well, we took a group of people to search the river... ...but it's so big and long. - Then what about the children? - We don't know where they are. You are all so useless. Listen to me. The children have surely headed back to Tokyo. Turn over every rock if you must, find me that girl and music box! You got it? You understand? Blast it all. Where could they have gone? We can't find it anywhere. It's too early to give up yet. We know it's somewhere on this earth. - Stop being so optimistic. - Let's just look everywhere we can. Look, Fatty and I will earn some money polishing shoes. You don't need to worry about getting by. Where are you going today? If we stay by the mouth of the river, it might just turn up. But that river mouth is about 100 meters wide. I wonder where that green music box could've gone. - Oh, is the green box a music box? - Yes. I have a music box. What? Really? - It's about this big. - Yes, it's just that size. Where is it? Please show us already! See? I have two! Oh, a pink one and a yellow one. I just love music boxes. That's why my mother bought them for me last year. We're looking for a green music box. Yeah. That's disappointing. But what a nice song it's playing. Those were the good old days My father was there, And so was my mother As I embraced my French doll I looked upon the cherry blossom In our yard The piano was waiting for me as well Those were the good old days The blue sky beyond the window, The birds would all sing Everyone was so kind and loving The stars fill the night sky On this Christmas Eve I can hear the cheerful bells Ringing in the distance Hey. Don't cry, Mami. Everyone, let's all stop crying and get out of here. Yes. I'm sorry for crying. My precious music box full of memories Where are you hiding, my red box? I look around everywhere for you Somewhere on the small mountain path My silhouette continues to cry There's no way we'll find it here. You're right. How are we supposed to find it here? - Hey, let's go back. - Yeah. I hate all of this. - Let's go back. - Okay. There they are! It's them! Stop! Get back here! Stop! Take this! Take this! - You idiot, it's me! - Sorry! Sorry? What kind of idiot mixes me up with a small child?! Come on! And what about that 15 yen I lent you the other day? Why would you bring that up— Hey! Get back here! Stop! Stop right there! You idiot! Oh, no! It's Lame! Oh, no! Giant! What should we do? Ruriko, get inside here. Where'd they go? - Where did they go? - Hey, look. Inside there. Over here? You think they're here? Welcome. Welcome. Where could they be? - Hey, children! - Children? What do you think about this? Kids, kids! - Not what you're looking for? - We're talking about kids! Kids? Kids... - That's 5,000 yen. - 5,000 yen?! For this? This... no, I'm looking for kids. What was that all about? Kids! Why were you inside there? Huh? We're sorry. We were being chased by some bad guys. We're very sorry. What in the world? That music box... Let's check it out. What is it? Sir, that's a music box, isn't it? - Yeah, it is. - Could we take a look at it? This has a really nice sound to it. There is no mistake, this is it! What is it? Sir, this was originally Ruriko's. Please, would you return it to her? What? I can't do that. It doesn't matter whose it was originally, I paid money for it. Then please sell this to us. Yes, of course. That's my whole business after all. I'll happily sell it to you if you want to buy it. - How much? - Well... I'll give you a special deal. We'll say 1,500 yen. What? 1,500 yen? I can drop it down another 100 yen if that would help. How much do you have? - 50 yen. - Oh, oka— 50 yen?! You have to be joking. Are you kids trying to have fun with me? Now, go home. If you want it, come back with some money and buy it. Now get on out of here. Hey, don't be so down. 1,500 yen is nothing! Are you going to borrow it? Not borrow! I'm going to earn it! I mean, you know that the two of us are polishing shoes, right? We're making 300 to 400 yen a day to live off of already. But if the five of us polish shoes... ...we'll be able to save 300 yen a day. If we save 300 yen a day, in order to save up to 1,500 yen... Let me think... - It would take 5 days. - That's right. We'll be able to save 1,500 yen in five days. I see! You're so smart! I'm really impressed! Aw, it's nothing. All right, starting tomorrow, we're all going to polish shoes! - Okay? - Yeah! Welcome. Here you go. Thank you. Would you like your shoes polished? Shoe shine! Get your shoe shine! - Thanks. - Thank you! Welcome. We'll be able to save 350 yen from what we earned today. If all goes well, we might be able to save up 1,500 yen in 3 more days. Yeah! - Thank you. - Thank you. That will be 20 yen. Thank you very much. - Welcome. - Welcome. - We're up to 800 yen now! - Only two more days! Hey, I bet we can make the rest tomorrow! This rain is going to set us back. You're right about that. Thank you. Welcome. - Welcome. - Step right up. But business is good the day after it rains. It seems that at this rate, we're going to earn the rest today! Thank you very much. We have the 1,500 yen saved up now. Hey, now. This isn't a place for children. Go on home now. Sir, where's the music box? Oh, that? I sold it this morning. What? You sold it? Who did you sell it to? A young woman in her late twenties. - Do you know who she was? - Now why would I? What's wrong? We all worked really hard to save up this 1,500 yen. I see. You really wanted it that badly? I'm sorry about that. Come on, let's go. I would've given it to you for free if you only said something. It's Giant and Lame! - Hey, there. - Yes? I heard you had a green music box here. Give it to me. Unfortunately, I've already sold it. What?! You sold it? - Who did you sell it? - A young woman in her late twenties. She said she wanted to buy it for her daughter. Who is she? I don't know. It's not like I ask every customer for their name. We just missed it! Is there some story to that music box? Some children came by saying they saved up to buy it. - Did you say children? - It's them! They must be around here. - What do we do? - We should tell the boss. Hey. What? You just missed it? Yes, sir. He said some young woman bought it for her daughter. And he said those kids came to buy it as well. - Kids? - Yes, sir. All right, I have an idea! What is it, boss? We'll set a trap that will either get us the music box or Ruriko. You got it? The circus is here! The circus, the circus Now, now, listen up! I have wonderful news! Little girls, little boys, Mommies and daddies We're here to give them all A big surprise The circus is here! The circus, the circus! Now, now, listen up To our wonderful news! To anyone who comes to our circus with a green music box tomorrow, they will get a wonderful gift! Now, what could that be? Who shall we award This wonderful gift to? We are giving away a prize of 50,000 yen! What? 50,000 yen?! Good luck on winning the prize! Hey, everyone, I have big news! Big news! It's about the circus, right? Oh, you already heard. When I saw that advertisement... ...I snuck over to check out the circus and I saw Giant! That circus must be a front for the spies! Then if we don't do anything... ...the green music box might fall into their hands! Even so... They'll catch us if we're not careful. It could even be a trap to catch us. I see... What should we do? Okay. We'll tell our friends about our situation and ask for their help. - What friends? - The other orphans in the House of Light. I'll sneak in there tonight and ask them. - That's a great idea! - A really great one! I'm sure our friends will help us! House of Light Hey, it's Shorty! Shorty! - Hey, how was your adventure? - Was it great? Where did you go? Tell us! Keep it down. I don't want to get caught. Hey, that's not fair! Tell us about your adventure! Yeah, yeah! I will. I have a lot to tell you. But I need your help to finish our adventure. - What is it? - We'll help! Well, come inside and tell us about it. Everyone, make sure you wait for the signal. - Got it? - Yeah. Let's go. - Little girl, what's your name? - Mami Ogawa. Here you go. Huh? Hey. What is this? They're wearing masks. How're we going to know now? Why are you all wearing masks? Let me see, let me see. No. We managed to get so many. They're all fake. Some are made from cardboard or fruit boxes. Not a single one of them are real. Detective Hello, this is the police. What? The House of Light? Ah, the orphanage. What? They've all run away? They all went to the circus? Yes! We'll send men out right away! It's not here. - Hey, bring in the next batch. - Yes, sir. Boss, these are the last of them. It's not here. - This is it! - We found it! We got the real one finally! Go! Stop them! Get back here! I got it! - Ruriko, hurry! - Give us back that box! What are you doing?! Get out of the way! - Mamiko! - Mother! I'm so glad to see you! - Shorty, that way! - Yeah. Why you little...! Grownups shouldn't be picking on kids. You're right. I'm sorry about that. - I'm sorry. - Take this! Quiet down! Quiet down! What is going on here? Officers, these men are foreign spies! - It's true! - You must be joking. These children are all thieves and delinquents. Please have them return that music box, and then arrest them immediately! You kids are from the orphanage, aren't you? No! There is an important secret hidden inside here. These men really are spies! Merely the imagination of adventurous children. - Enough, just give it to me. - No, stop! - Give it back, now! - Captain! - We found Professor Kimura in the back! - Professor Kimura? - Oh, Ruriko. - Father! Ruriko! - Mother! - Ruriko. You must be Professor Kimura who was reported missing. Yes. Captain, arrest these men! Stop where you are! You're coming with us! They've finally been caught. Father, Mother... You're both alive! They tortured us every day to get me to talk. I really thought I was done for. You must be Ruriko's father. I'm Shorty. I'm good friends with Ruriko. I'm Fatty. I'm Bean Pole. Thank you. It seems that you took good care of Ruriko for us. Aw, it was nothing. We will tell you all about it some other time. Here's your music box. We did it. No! This isn't it! This is the wrong song. This one is a fake! Yes, this isn't the one. Really? Aw. It's a fake. What a disappointment. Oh? That music. That's the real music box! Mami! This is my mother. You're Mami's mother? Thank you for taking care of her. I received a letter saying Mamiko had come all the way to Tokyo alone. I would search for her every day in places children might gather. Then you were the one who bought that music box from the secondhand store? I bought it because Mamiko loves music boxes. Here. This is it! There's no mistake. You're right. Thank goodness. This is it. This is my secret research. Do you have a lighter? I do. - Here you go. - Thank you. - Father! - Professor! This is a secret that bad men will never stop pursuing. It is best that it is burned. Ah, thank goodness it didn't fall into evil hands. Ruriko, Shorty. It's all thanks to you. You have my gratitude. Captain, please tell them too. Good job, boys. The whole world thanks you for what you've done. Temple bells ring On the hillside marking end of day In the west the sun is setting With a reddish glow After a beautiful sunset, the sky turns dark as day becomes night. We can see many familiar faces by the window where Ruriko was so lonely. Ruriko's family has taken in Shorty, Bean Pole, and Fatty. Mami is staying with her mother now... ...but she's come to spend the night today. The beautiful sound of the music box. The children's dreams take them to the skies. Oh, Ruriko's here!
