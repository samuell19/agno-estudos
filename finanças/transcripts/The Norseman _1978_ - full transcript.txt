This movie is based on real events. As early as 793 AD, a vigorous horde of huge blondes descended from the frozen mountains of Norway, to sail bravely on the seas in their long ships called drakkare. Au fost numiþi "nordici". Without rest and blessed with great power, these "northerners" conquered much of what is now called "Europe". Facing the wild wind and the waves and the horrible death warnings, They turned their attention westward, beyond the setting sun, until they came across a new land. They called him Vinland. We call it America. Trage ! slow ! slow ! slow ! slow ! Eu sunt Eric Helge, prinþ din Helgeland. A kingdom by the sea, in the land of the Nordics. I was 12 when my brother took me on board, heading west, on the sea ​​... beyond where the sun sets. It was the year 1006 AD, according to the Roman calendar Less than a year before , our father, King Eurich, he had sailed west to discover new lands, where no one had come before. And he had never been seen again. Our whole kingdom mourns for my father and his people. When my brother Thorvald decided to go look for him, he spread joy throughout the land. Now we were sailing in the swirling sea, in our fastest drakkar, called "Raven". Our dreams and hopes were not just to find a new land, but let us see our father again, and let the people see their king again. His helper was Ragnar, a stubborn man known for his anger at the Saxons and the Celts. Ragnar's son Rauric was an experienced warrior. This is Olaf, my brother's most loyal man He can't talk. His tongue was cut off many years ago, in a raid on the African coast. El e cel care i-a tãiat-o. He was overwhelmed by Olaf. He now wears a severed tongue around his neck They were joined by other warriors, Ivar, Ode, Ubbi, and Björn. All the "living legends " of our country. Every man on board "Raven" was chosen by my brother for his courage in battle and his knowledge of navigation. The Wizard, "The Visionary of Death" he had a dark face and frightening, whose presence had provoked a slight uneasiness among the crew. No one had ever seen his face and he was always with his hawk. My brother, Thorvald the Bold. He was a feared and respected warrior among the Norse. It was my father's reliable support. Our country has been peaceful and prosperous for many years, because of its great power. Say the spells, wizard! Look in the darkness of the storm and tell me! Is there a danger on the horizon? The storm will stop. Tomorrow we will arrive in a new land. A new land? What do the stars tell you about this new land? A fertile ground awaits us. But in the days to come ... there will be dangers. So be it. Sit down, young Eric. We are in danger tonight. Glory be to the god Odin! I found a new land in the west. - For Odin! - For Odin! For Odin! NORDICUL Subtitles: Cristian 82 / d'Artagnan I was looking forward to hearing from you about the strange noises I heard on the beach. I heard some footsteps that I recognized immediately. I breathed a sigh of relief As I approached him that morning ... I will never forget him the look in his eyes ... from behind the sacred mother. You told me about the dangers in the days to come, wizard. If you disappoint me and my people again, I'll send you on the sea ​​on a raft. Praise be to Odin. Glorify that you allowed Björn to die as a Nordic should. Björn's body was sent by sea to Valhalla, because he died with a sword in his hand. Lord Ragnar, further on the beach, is a mouth of a large river. - Something else ? - No trace of crops. In the forest I came across a kind of grape, which I found very tasty. It will be written that this land ... will be called Vinland. Wizard ... what do you have to say? You know what we don't know. See what we don't see. Who killed Björn? Where am I ? How many are there? Have you lost your powers ... or have you never had them? It would have been a blessing if he had taken you Odin, not Björn. You will lose an arm ... And he won't have a head. That's enough ! This bastard and the miserable ... Tomorrow we will sail the river. Wine, Eric! Sailing on the river? I'll talk to them about it. And I predict you 'll be at the bow of the ship tomorrow. We've already had an unpleasant start in this new land. I already had a dead man ... and an unknown enemy. With each rowing race I began to doubt myself more and more, that my father was still alive. If his drakkar had even reached this new land, sure ... he would have met the same enemy. Any reason my brother had for sailing this narrow river, no one had any questions ... because he brought us here so far, across the swirling sea, in safety. The ship was tested. And he stayed there ... most of the day. His gaze was fixed on the shore. His face ... showed us his determination. We are in a vulnerable position. We were lured to this intended river, and now we stand here like women, waiting to be caught. We need the sea to secure our backs. The sea is our protector. From childhood, we defended our country by shedding the blood of our enemy. The shores of our country are strewn with the remains of our enemies, whose ambition was greater than their fighting skills. Not once have we turned our backs on an enemy. or a ship that threatened us. The day I turn my back and hide from a new enemy, it will be the day when I will be looked upon as a woman in my own country. I'm asking you now ... ... when did a Nordic turn his back on his peers? Never. Never. When the day comes for a Nordic to do so, We will all throw our swords into the deepest part of the sea. Lord Thorvald, we will anchor the ship and put guards. We all need to take risks to try to save our comrades. And we are with you. For Odin! Okay, Eric. It's good that you made that decision, But with this decision you have to deal with a terrible discovery. I saw King Eurich in my dreams. There is a great danger to him and to your people. Take care of your bird, wizard! I made up my mind. They haven't tied us up like this since the first day they captured us. They can be removed very easily. That doesn't bother me. They are afraid of something. What happened ? What is it ? I know you understand me. Did something happen ? Is anyone coming? Glory be to Odin. They came. They have finally come. They have come, my Lord. Finally. They crossed the sea ... to take us back home. It's time to dump her and move on. Will you let me go into the woods tomorrow ... explore the new land? Eric, if you came ashore with us, Who else would he trust to guard the ship? I was disappointed when he told me I couldn't go. But I knew ... this wasn't the right time for me, boy, to go down to land. Every day we recorded all the events of our trip. I was optimistic that I would finally record ... finding our father. Eric, I had a vision. I saw a blond boy turn into a frog, right in front of my eyes. Warriors. Olaf! Get ready, fast! The ship! Olaf ! My lord, Thorvald! When it is daylight, do we return to the sea to be protected? Now. Tomorrow we will look for my father and his faithful comrades. - Let's find out if I'm still alive. - After all the losses suffered today ... We can not. Get back to your people ! Don't forget the battle of Rodan. We Nordics were outnumbered and wounded ... and we retreated. Then we went back to kill the Saxons. I remember the battle of Rodan well. I was there. I also remember today's battle. I was there too. Wizard! Come on in, wizard! Come on in, wizard! What advice do you have for me? There are many. They are not like the other enemies you have faced. I live in this land the way animals live wild in our high mountains, from home. To go after them in the woods It's worse than crossing the high Alps, to kill the polar bear with your bare hands. Pleacã! I told you to leave. I'm ready ! - Ready for what? - Ready for battle. I want to fight with you. Eric, we need to talk. That's it, we're going to fight now! I 'm celebrating victory, my king. You are right. I only remember our capture ... and the death of our people. The night of the same ceremony ... and the betrayal of Kiwonga. Stop it! Even if I'm here ... Isn't the drakkar anchored on the coast? Or it's anchored on the river we sailed on. Choose me, my Lord. I will kill the guards with my bare hands. It is not over yet. At the right time, we will fight like Nordics, again, because Odin will be our eyes, the strength and soul that the Nordics have always had. We can only hope that the girl will help us. Perhaps because of the help provided, the fate of the battle has not yet been decided. No Nordics were brought into captivity tonight. I think they'll be back soon ... to take us home. The weapon! Olaf! The weapon! Jos! There ! "She's the same woman I've seen before." - I bet it's a trap. May be. We will make her come to us. - Take the crossbow! - Crossbow ! - We're too close to shore. - Prepare people. Archers, watch out for the forest. Now slow! He's coming on board. - Who is ? - I don't know. But he has our father's dagger. Get down, Eric! This dagger belonged to my father . Our King, Eurich. - She wants us to follow her. "In an ambush." Maybe ... but he risked his life to come here. Olaf, Thrall, Ivar and Ubbi! We'll go face to face. Olaf... If she's a trap ... kill her first! You led us to our king. We will come back. It's the right time. They're getting ready for battle again tonight. When they come, we will be ready. And mort. Rolf! Rolf! Rooolf ...! Hands. Give me your hands. For Odin. For Thor. For Rolf. A true Nordic. I think Drakkar "Raven" will be attacked on this river bank by the end of the day. With my sword and Odin's help, I will free the king and his men. You, Ragnar ... will be waiting for us on the coast ... ... at the end of the day. It took us two days to get here. Now you ask me the impossible. I saw. I saw. I saw the wizard's face. Brothers! When we see each other again on the coast, I hope to see a young Nordic, not an idiot frog. What does he look like, Eric? For Eric! For Eric! You better go and make peace with the wizard. I hope you know that if we don't come back by the end of the day, You will have to take the Drakkar "Raven" and these people into the country. Ragnar ... Wizard, I'll tell you a secret. I don't believe in your spells, magic, dreams, and prophecies. Today is your chance to prove me wrong. So cast your spells and show off your best magic. If my ship doesn't reach the shore to meet Lord Thorvald ... ... before the end of the day ... your head ... will float on the sea. Don't worry, Eric! They will return. - What if they don't come back? - Then we go after them. Eric, get down! Be careful, Ragnar! Be careful, the ship is approaching! Ragnar! Behind you ! We have to leave. There are too many. Shoot once more, and get to the oars! Sit down until we leave! slow ! slow ! slow ! slow ! I feel like they'll be there soon. Thorvald. Father. Sire, your eyes ... It is the will of the gods. As Odin was my strength ... ... you will be my eyes. Sire, we need to hurry. Lord Ragnar, what are we doing? This day is far from over. My brother and his warriors were gone for hours, And we had only traveled a short distance on the river. Lord Ragnar knew that without the help of the wind, It would be unlikely to reach the coast until sunset. Stay with only a few old people on board, I really needed a miracle. We only had a few hours of light left. Two other young people died. The wizard had fallen into thoughts Suddenly, it started. I felt it in front of me. He had finally come. The wind. The wind in the sky. Oh, cum mai sufla ! Lower the sail! Hold on tight, Eric! We are heading for the sea. Spread the sail! I am close. We have to hurry. Olaf, can you hear me? I order you, come on! It will be written ... that the name "Olaf", will remain in the land of the Nordics. Lord Thorvald ordered the dragon "Raven" to go home at sunset. I did it. Hurry up! Quick ! Quick ! Wine. Haideþi! Haideþi! Haideþi! Thrall, the man is dead. He was already dead when I left the cave, but he deserves to be buried like a Nordic. Haideþi! Help them! Help them get on board! - Tatã ! - Eric ! Eric ... my son ... Father... Olaf!? Olaf ! Haide! Haide ! Haide , Olaf ! Olaf ! Olaf ! Olaf ! OK friend ! Lower the sail! Lower the sail! Spread the sail! Get to the oars! All oars! slow ! slow !
