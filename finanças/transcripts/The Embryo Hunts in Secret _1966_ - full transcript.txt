"Let the day perish wherein I was born! Why did I not die in the womb? Why did I not come forth from the womb and expire?" From The Old Testament, Job Chapter 3 THE EMBRYO HUNTS IN SECRET Directed by KOJI WAKAMATSU Rain, rain even harder! - Not here! - Let's go to my place. Is this your apartment? It's empty! Does it surprise you? If I had such an apartment, I would furnish it. Do all single men apartments look like this? I don't always live here. - Can I take a bath? - I'll turn on the boiler. She's the living image of her, she's identical. You scared me! The boiler might take a while to be ready. - What's your name? - Yuka Cute name, isn't it? She will wear the white dress too, and will also want to make a baby soon. Honey, I'm done bathing! They're very much alike, they're as like as two peas. Does this turn you on? Stop it. With how many men have you gone so far? Silly. With how many men have you gone? I always ask the first time, with how many men have you gone? I don't remember, seven, eight... Like this every time? You're hurting me! I've asked you if it was like this every time. It depends... sometimes. - Fuck! - No! Easy. Come on... Faster. Women always say so. I hate you! I've sobered up. Here's your sleeping pill. I have to be out by nine. I'll wake you up. Let's do eleven and a half, I can't be late anyway. - You have a day off tomorrow, right? - No, I have a date. You can tell me everything. What? Are you kidding? Aren't we making love in this crummy apartment after all? Did you come to the wedding with a clerk of my department store? - No, with a customer. - You shouldn't date such bad lots. That guy has a vicious look, just thinking about him makes me sick. I know little about you. What do you know? What do you know about me? I know that you are our manager Marukido. That you're handsome. I'd heard people talk about you and I liked you already. I know that you don't like women, that you prefer teens instead. Come here. How cute, you look just like her. Do you lust for me? I'll make love to you till you cry. If you want to escape, you have to do it now. Women like you make me sick! You're just a snotty-nosed clerk, you're filthy, and yet you parade as a lady. I'll show you now that women like you are nothing but dogs. There are things I can forgive and others I can't. Turd brains like you can't tell the difference. What does making love mean to you? Do you understand at least what you do? You work at the men's clothing department, thus you know how to count pairs of socks, you know if they're many or few, if they're pricey or cheap. That's all you know, if something's stylish, gaudy or sober. Dogs are different, they know how to count only up to three. If they litter four pups and one of them's taken away, they don't care because there's three of them left, but if another is taken and there's only two left, they get mad and despair. Women like you are just like dogs, they know how to count, yet can't tell the difference between one and two, two less and it's over, but if there's only one less, all is fine. It's just like in the army once, it was exciting to gather the troops, lining them up from left to right. In the National Unity system, he who fell out could be left to die, and there would be nothing wrong about it after all. That's the rationalism embedded in your hearts. But there's something irrational about it haunting you from the day you were born: this body is your greatest irrationality. Because of this flesh, which is nothing but a shitbag, you call flesh "Nature" and forget about the rest. Am I wrong? For women who can't discern their parents from their brothers, who can't see flesh, love, piss, shit and humanity, I have this whip of love I received from the gods almighty. With my pure blood I will bring together again your flesh and soul. Look, this is your face. It looks like you, doesn't it? It's the mortuary mask of my wife, who ran away. She left one year ago, saying that she would give birth to her baby. Don't you understand? I don't want you to have children. Everybody make and raise kids, but I don't want. This is why I had this operation so I couldn't procreate. It would also be terrible for you and above all for our child. You've seen the medical certificate. It is unnatural! I wouldn't bear such a pain. I want a baby all mine! No. - Only one. - I said no! Liar! I went to the hospital. The doctor explained me that another operation could revert your state and make you fertile again. Idiot! I want a baby, I mean it! I said no! You do as you please. A baby all mine, only one. One or two, it wouldn't matter. - Egoist. - Knock it off. Whatever I do, you don't understand. Shut up. Then I... - I want to be a mother. - Cut it out. I want to change its diapers, wash its clothes, breast-feed it. Who are you? Whose baby do you want to breed? Making love to a man and growing a child, is that what you want? I won't let you do that! All right then. I agree to let something grow in the warmth of your belly, as those are moments of happiness. The warmth of the mother's womb is pure bliss, it is paradise. But there's more to it, too good a story if it ended all like that. When a baby is born, it comes out of her mother's womb into this world, from one happy world to this hell, to this valley of tears. Across a dark and narrow way out into this world full of wounds and blood. It is hell, it's the true hellish sufferings. And you think you could endure all that? That woman was also like you, she was a dog who knew nothing but numbers. I can't forgive women like you. Just like dogs, who only know how to count up to three, you know nothing about yourselves and you can't admit that giving birth is as divine as it is harrowing. You just can't believe it. You are smart, you should understand what I say. I don't want to kill you. I won't only wake up at 11:30, but every half-hour. I will slowly train you. I don't like cheap whores, I prefer nice girls, girls of a shining purity. - What time is it? - Ten o'clock. It hurts bad! My God, what have you done? Forget about it. You did this to me and I should forget? Don't get mad. Of course you're the manager, but you've passed the limit. Why did you do this to me? I wanted you to learn some womanly manners. This is awful! Shut up! - If you want to cry, do it quietly. - How can you cry quietly? Does this make you feel better? You kidding? You're a sleazy woman, don't give yourself airs. You're the butt of jokes at the department store. No more pretense. What do you mean by laughingstock? Do they laugh at me? I don't poke fun at you. You've done worse than that. You're not happy about it? It's for your own good. What at your talking about? Knock it off. I am a woman, don't you make fun of me! I'm being serious. You're nowhere near a single and handsome young manager, you're nothing but a rotten pervert! What? I gave you 30,000 yen and you're only slightly wounded. Now you think you can fool me with money. - I am evil and childish. - Let me go! Please! I swear I won't treat you bad anymore. You can have my apartment to yourself, I can also give it to you as a present. What? You're nothing but impotent, but you give yourself out as a great man. You're the kind of guy who'd leave your wife cuckold you. You think I look like your ex wife? Not in the least! Although I don't look like one, I am a modern girl. You think I can replace your ex wife? Don't count your chickens before they hatch! What can a loser who knows nothing about men and women do? Fuck you! Bitch! Let me go! You're crazy, let go of me! Stop it! Cry on as much as you like, I'm gonna fix you now. Listen to me carefully, you've been acting insolently. Are you disdaining my money? I'll rip that sickening pride out of you. You're a slut, a stinking dog. Until you obey me, your master, I won't neither feed you nor let you complain about it. I will train you back to purity. You can't leave this place, this is all the world you need. Will you obey my orders? I'll give you water if you comply, but if you don't, I'll shave your head, I'll tear out your nails and I'll choke you! My baby, breeding a baby of mine... It can't be my baby. I beg you to tell me. Whose baby is it? Tell me! At this rate you will learn to understand what you see. I am your master, I am angry, I don't like the way you show your affection. Go! Go and bring back the dead and tortured bodies of my mother and my wife. Whore! Dog! Make up for lost time, revenge me. What do you have in mind? Where's the woman of my dreams, you cheap hoe? I can't forgive. I've been deceived for a long time at this point. The head of Queen Marie Antoinette rolled on the block in front of the crowd. It was chopped by the guillotine which claimed the blood of thousands of people. After the war, my mother suffered hardship and committed suicide in the wake of a nervous breakdown by hanging herself down from the staircase at the store. Mother! You have to try harder! Faster. Keep going! Freeze. Here. Good girl. Help! Murderer! Stop it! Don't try to escape again, I'll kill you next time. The greatest absurdity for me lies in the fact that I was born. Why was I born? Mother, why did I come out of your womb? Why did you give birth to me? Why have I suffered so much? You are my wife, you belong to me. Yet you eloped with that dirtbag! It's not true! Whore! Why did you run away? It's not because of a man... ...but only because of a baby. A baby? I only wanted a baby! What is Nature? The rain falls and thunders roar, people are born, and then die. Mother, you were in heat... and this is natural too. Women love nature and surrender its laws. They imagine themselves free and turn into beasts, into beasts... Mother, you fed me in that stalactites cave which is your womb, you became aware of me. Mammals living deep inside a stalactites cave, wag their tails and rub their heads. What were you looking for? What were you afraid of? Just like a dog. I am what I am, I don't want anything. I just want to breathe, if I'm hungry I'll bite your throat and tear you to shreds. I'm not afraid. I was only scared at the beginning, I wanted you to love me. I only despise you now, you're a loser. Do you want me? What do you want from me? - Looking for mummy? - You stupid whore! I want a woman to myself, one who takes me as I am, and I will succeed if I make you my wife. You're nothing but a dog in front of me, you're a dog, that's what you are. - You will meet my mother. - No! I'll say it again, you're a dog! You're a dog! What are you? What are you? - I'm... - You what? I'm a dog. What are you? A dog. Whose dog? Yours. Good girl. Here's the man you were looking for. That's him, my baby's father! The doctor said: "If you really long to have a baby, resort to artificial insemination". Artificial insemination? You are my husband, my treasured husband, but I wanted a baby that only a perfect sperm cell could fecundate. You never got me pregnant, although you deeply loved me. A baby, I wanted a baby! That's not true! Having a baby... That's not true! That's not true! You behaved well. My magnificent dog, my untrained dog, my untrained slave. Such is my life, and the woman of my life, I have finally found her... I'll set you free if you behave. You're leaving me? I won't return, I will give birth to my baby. Take care. Please, come back! Don't bear your baby! If you swear not to escape, I will untie you. No, of course you'd run away. My wife wanted to do the same, such a bitch! Hold it! Here. It's a violation of human rights! You don't want children, but I want to be a mother. What are you afraid of? You are crazy. It's true... I did horrible things, but I will make you my wife. You are the only woman for me! Tell me it will be so. Sleep, fair child. In the garden and on the grass Little birds and sheep will all sleep... Damn you! Help! You've put on an act so far, haven't you? What's the matter? Nothing, it's the TV. Here's your bills, for gas and water consumption. Hold on a second. Why escaping? What for? To rub my sleepy eyes every morning, brush my teeth, then pull on my less run stockings and dash to the store. To hide yawns and be standing the whole day. This is what I am. And how will this man change me? He gives me money and tells me I can live in this apartment. What do you think will happen then? Nothing. Look! These hands, this chest, these legs all belong to my body, they're mine. Buying and selling is my own work. Bitch! I had thought about forgiving you. You've put on such a bad act. You damned whore! Forgive me! I forgive you, but first I'll turn you into a real stray dog. Whore! I am going to kill you, and hang you like my mother. Like my mother, my lover, who couldn't stand my eyes on her anymore, and hanged herself with the rope. Perfect, this is exactly what I needed. What are you doing? Who are you looking for? What are you looking for? What am I looking for? I'm looking for a woman, a woman to myself, as lovely and kind as my mother. - Your mother is only a woman. - That's not true. I want my mother! Yuka, you're going to fancy this. You want to escape, don't you? - If you do, say it. - I want to escape. Fuck, you can't! Here, the last drop of alcohol. Drink! Drink! You damned whore! Don't go, please. I'm going to... kill you! I'm gonna kill you! Mother! Fair child, fair child... may tomorrow be a brighter day... THE END
