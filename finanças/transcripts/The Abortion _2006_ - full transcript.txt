How do you feel? In limbo. All empty. It seems like touching down is easier. But how will we touch the sky? My feet are of the ground. I'm somewhere high. But I can't touch the sky either. Stuck somewhere in between. Today we'll start early. Come on girls, let's stretch. We are running out of time. We still have to work on choreography. Do like this. Do you understand? Now watch me. Do it like that. Not like that. Your make up will be like that for the show. OK. Cenk'll like it too. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Reach out and turn. 3, 4 and 1, 2, 3, 4. And 1 and 2 and 3 and 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. And 1, 2, 3, 4. - It still hurts? - Yes. Why don't you go and see a doctor? You're right. Bravo! This was much better. I'll go and get changed in a second. Alright! - How was it? - Show is great. No problem with it. - But it'll be better with costumes. - But what? - You were great, honey. - You too, sweetheart. It'll be much better with the costumes. - See you later. - See you. - Bye. - Bye. I see no problem. Everything is OK. How's the synchro with the music? If there is more rhythm... - Where is Eda? - She is out. Alright. They are a bit weird, right? Eda. Eda. Eda. - How are you? - Fine. You don't look fine. What happened? No, I am just tired. Do you work a lot? When is the show? Soon. Very soon... Why? Will you come? Should I? It's up to you. Do you have time? We are going too fast! I feel sick in the stomach... No we are not. You shouldn't eat too much candy. No harm, no joy. But what do you know about it? What should it be that I wouldn't know? Won't you stop? Won't you answer this? - Hello? - Hello? Where are you? On your way? I'm on the way. Are you? Is he the uncle, you mentioned? Yes. Are you going home? I don't know. OK. Shall we meet tonight? I call you later. OK? - OK then, I see you at school. - OK. Is there such a thing as to be in the right place on the right time? How do we know that the time is right? How do we know that the place is right? Is it the moment or a spot on the currency of time? If we can't interfere to the time and place then what is destiny? Everything is alright. Everything will be alright. I'm fine. I'm fine. Everything is alright. Everything will be alright. I'm fine. I'm fine. Congratulations. You are pregnant. It's the 16th week now. Everything seems alright. Anyway at this stage you can't have an abortion, even if you want to. After 3 months abortion is an option only for cases with anomalies. Come back next week for the routine control. As I said before at this stage abortion is not an option. Only babies with severe diseases can be aborted. Even in that case late abortions jeopardise the mother's life too. You wanna know which sex the baby is? Are you married? Am I pregnant? Is this why I feel so bad? Welcome. May I see Mr. Cihan? Mr. Cihan, you have a guest. - What can I get you? - Water please. - Sure. - Thank you. I told you not to come here. Why don't you ever listen to me? If anybody calls, I am busy. I have lots of things to do. Tell me why are you here? You have one minute! I've seen a doctor. You forgot this at my place. I thought you might need it. It's your wife's present, right? No it's my son's present. What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do all alone? God knows when we gonna see each other again. A fear that freezes my life, shivers my vanes. When the day comes you have to make your mind. I am not as strong as I thought. Life is really a two way street. The things that told to you when you are a little girl... ...you never understand till you live it by yourself. When the day comes you have to decide. I am not as strong as I thought. I'm alone. Life is really a two way street. This is the end of the road. - Hello? - I'm coming alright, alright. - Where is Eda? - I don't know. Then you are putting the costume on! Don't scream baby, nothing to worry about. Nurse, hand me the Kocher Forceps! It's always you who have the fun and we who have to deal with it. Don't scream baby, nothing to worry about. Sending messages, right? He does not reply, does he? 3 years later Do you want some more? No, it was enough. Thank you. How is the baby? Good, very good. Thank you. You have to be careful. - You're very active because of occupation. - Not that much. You would change the car. Couldn't decide yet? I couldn't decide yet, I think I'll wait for a while. I will wait for the new models. No need to hurry. The baby is on it's way. There will be expenses! Would you want some more? No thank you. OK, let me get the dessert. Don't trouble yourself. We won't be having any dessert. Then I'll get some for Cenk. Goodnight, papa. See you later. I thought they would never leave. Your mother gave me the face, again! - Eda! - Get off me! Careful! Are you OK sweetheart? Are you OK? Cenk! Cenk! Mom? Eda? What happened darling? You had a nightmare? - It's alright darling. - A nightmare. - Can I bring you anything? - OK, OK. I wanted to check if you are awake. What's up? A nightmare again? Wanna see a shrink? I know a very good one. Eda, who is it behind you? Is it Cenk? Cenk is asleep. We are alone in the house. Don't scare me. Eda? It's OK. It's me. It's OK. What are you doing up all night? OK, I'm with you, I'm near by you. Come on. Why don't you go sleeping? I'll be back as I shut it off. Hello. Eda? Is that you, Oya? Yes it's me. What happened? Nothing. I am tired because of this pregnancy I guess. Are you alright now? Yes I am. I am fine. I am waiting for dinner, alright? Sure. OK then, see you tonight. - Bye. - Bye. We are all hungry. - I'll get some more. - Everything is so delicious. - Have a nice meal. - It's enough thank you. Eda you didn't even touch your plate. - I am eating. - You have to eat, Eda. Yes, I will eat. But first I'll go to the bathroom. - Be careful! - Eda, are you OK? I am alright. - Are you hurt? - No, I just stumbled. I am fine. Mommy, be careful. We are working on a broom for your daughter. Mommy... Eda, Eda! Calm down, relax. It's over. Tell me. Where were you that day? I am so happy to have you. If I wouldn't tell this to anyone, I'd go mad. Of course you will tell me. I am your best friend. I don't know, it was terrifying. I don't know... Good bye, ma'am. Can I talk to you for a second? I couldn't finish the homework that... Mommy. Why did you kill me? Eda! Eda! Eda, we are with you. Just relax darling. Call an ambulance. It's alright. Just relax. My mommy used to love me. We went out every day and every night. She was the only star in the sky. Now she's gone. I wonder where she is. Cenk can you bring us two bottles of water? - Sure. - Thank you. Oya! Here it is. - Eda? - Cenk. What happened? - Eda? - What happened to me? Why are we here? Don't worry. You'll be fine. You'll recover. I am very cold. Don't worry. We are all here. Everything will be alright. How is my baby? Is she alright? Now you have to think about yourself first. - Darling... - Eda! - Eda! Call a doctor. Calm down. Step back! Prepare the injection. Could you please get away form the patient? The mother will be OK. It wasn't an easy case for us. She lost a great amount of blood. We couldn't save the baby. But the mother is just fine. She had a very bad abortion in the past. She won't be able to give birth to a baby. Her psychological situation is very important at this stage. There's not much for us to do. You can take her home. But I insist her to see a specialist. Is there anything that we can do to help? No, no, I am fine. You may go. - Give us a call tonight, OK? - OK. "She had a very bad abortion in the past." "She won't be able to give birth to a baby." Don't worry. Everything will be just fine. I don't feel OK, Cenk. You just got out of the hospital. You have to get some rest. Not like that. Then how? Take me... Take me to the doctor. Take me to the doctor. I am not sure but... ...I guess I am paying the price of my mistakes. Take me to the doctor. Take me to the doctor. Can you sleep well? No, I can't. I constantly have nightmares. I don't wanna sleep anyway. OK. I see. Did you experience some sort of trauma, lately? Can you remember anything? Yes, OK. Some of them are so terrifying. We are always together. Days and nights. In my dreams, everywhere. It feels so real. Sometimes I doubt which one is dream... ...and which one is my true life. Is it my childhood? Is it me? Since when are you having these nightmares? We are together for a very long while. We can not live free of space. Spaces are our irrevocable parts. Every new space is a new life. Either aparts us from our past... ...or pushes our past to deeper. Of course to resurrect in the future. - My love. - And the princess is here. Welcome. - How are you? - I'm fine. - Did you see the doctor today? - Yes I did, we talked. I am very relieved right now. - Good. We'd have a coffee, right? - Sure we would. It's busy. Alright then. I'll prepare coffee for my wife. We ran out of coffee. We'll have the coffee outside, OK? OK. Come on. - I'm so thirsty. - OK. - Are you alright, dear? - Yes I am fine. Honey you go home. I'll get the carry-bags and come right away. OK. - Hello? Honey, did you get my suitcase? Cenk, where are you? Eda are you there? Eda...Eda! Eda what's happening? Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! Goo! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! - Eda! - Go away! Go! Go! Go! - Eda, it's OK! Calm down, it's over! Go away, leave me! Leave me alone! Eda calm down honey. It will be all over. Eda, it's OK. It's over now. Don't leave me please. Don't leave me Cenk. - I'm with you darling. - Don't leave Cenk. Please don't leave me Cenk. Don't leave me! Are you sure? I'll tell you again. At this stage we can't be sure but... ...the symptoms that we observe suggest that... ...your wife might have schizophrenia. She has to stay here for a while in order to be sure. - Can I see her? - Of course. Visit her as much as possible. It would also help us a lot. Thank you. Cenk, why don't they let us see Eda? - OK sweetheart. - Is there anything we can do? No, thank you. Kaan, you can leave. - Let's know if anything happens. - Sure. - Cenk... - Come on honey, let's go. - It's me sweetheart. - Come, come, come. Did you bring my toys? Your toys? Promise, next time I'll bring your toys. You won't forget, will you? I won't forget, don't worry. Wait for me, I'll bring them now. Eda, honey. I brought your toys. So our toys are here. She'll be very happy. But she is not here now. When will she come? She will come, right? I understand that you are not alone here. How nice. Do you have any friends? My daughter. Your daughter? Cenk let's go home. Take us away. Of course dear. Let's just get some fresh air. Eda? Don't worry about me. I'm with my daughter. Edaaaaaaaaa!
