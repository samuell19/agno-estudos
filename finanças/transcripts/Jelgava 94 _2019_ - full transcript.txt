The snow will melt one day. But it hasn’t happened yet. The city looks white and cold. White noise on the TV. Dad trying to adjust the antenna. Mum making an omelette with leftovers from yesterday’s roast... It’s time to get up! I put on my blue pullover, the one whose collar is always a bit too tight. But the main thing is – not to get roughed up on the way to school. This is Jelgava. Year 1994. No matter how far I go, I can’t get away from this place. For as long as I’ve travelled, my memories bring me back here. I hear the silence at dad’s factory. The tramps getting high on eau de cologne. The nausea caused by the toxic aroma of change. My city waking up. That’s me. That’s me! - Happy birthday! - Candies! How many can I take? - One. - What if I take two? - No! - Welcome to our class! - Congrats! - Thanks. - What, what did you say? - What are you doing? - Good morning! - Good morning! - Sit down! What’s happened Jānis? - My bag fell apart. - Some interesting Latvian words have appeared in your essays. And some of you are using the word “terribly” wrongly. - Teacher! - Thanks! An essay is not a math test. It doesn’t have any right or wrong answers. An essay shows your thoughts. Feel free. I’d like Jānis to read a paragraph from his essay. Listen, please! - Duke Jacob’s bedroom had luxurious tapestry, made from woven wool. They released tiny wool particles, which the Duke inhaled and then coughed out together with pieces of his lungs. “Coughed out together with pieces of his lungs!” That’s funny. I asked him to read it out to inspire you. - I don't get it. How can you cough out pieces of your lungs? - From wallpaper. Worms took a liking to living in it. Later on, they relocated to the duke's lungs. - I thought the only place worms lived was in your ass. What was it with me and dukes back then? There was nothing to do in this city except train one’s imagination. - Where are you going? What is that? - What a smartass. - Yee, looks like a clever one. What are you reading? - Maybe he’s a faggot? - Give me some dough! What’s the matter? - Give it back, please? - What? - What’s the matter, Einstein? - Give me the dough, smartass! - I don’t have any. - Let’s beat him up. - Think we should? - I dunno. Today, on April 8, 1994, the news were spread about the fact that Kurt Cobain, the leader of the group “Nirvana” was found dead at his home in Seattle. The cause of the death is not clear yet, but it seems more like a suicide. “Nirvana” is a cult group, but Curt is a new generation musician that makes everyone crazy. Curt Kobein once said that the audience had misunderstood what he wanted to say with his songs. A bit from the history. On his 14th birthday, Cobain's uncle Chuck offered him - Coming! either a bike or a used guitar. Kurt chose the guitar... - Faster! - Jānis! Happy birthday! Happy birthday, son! - And now the fireworks! - Jānis, now your real life has begun! Now you need to figure out what you’re interested in? - A lawyer! - Jānis likes to keep his cards to himself. There’s always business. Yes, business. - No. Anything but that. He writes very well. His essays are very good. Yes, he could be a journalist. Or a lawyer. - A lawyer? - There’s always work for lawyers. He should study law! - Son, what do you want to do? - Have you ever heard of "Nirvana"? - Who? - "Nirvana". - That’s… Something like… Have some more salad! - Listen, Jānis! That’s when you realize that your whole life is pointless. Then you’ll have reached nirvana. - Now there’s just one truth. He who’s got the most money owns the truth. - Askold, that’s not true. - Yes, it is. - I disagree. - It’s true. - Where’s your uniform? What now? - Good afternoon! - Good afternoon! If I catch someone smoking in the toilets again, like this princess, I will personally... - Who did that? - Are you morons?! Go back to your place! Who did that? It looks like you think this is very funny! Uldis, see you in my office after class. No problem, there are other schools in Jelgava too. And you can always find some way to earn money. Or by begging! - You should be sent to fight in Afghanistan! - Hi! - Hi! - Kristīne! What are you listening to? - “Brainstorm”. - You don’t listen to “Nirvana”? - Why “Nirvana”? They... - Hey! - Hey! - They stink and puke, and sniff glue, and whatever else you all get up to. - Right. - Why would I want that? - How do you know all that? - I have an older brother. - I also have an older sister. - My brother listens to that music. - Ok. - Do you want to borrow some tapes? - Yes. - Let’s go then. - Now? - Now. - What’s this? - Yuppi. Just add this to water and you get a lemonade. Haven’t you tried it? - No, I haven’t. Are you sure your brother won’t mind if I borrow the tape? - Who cares what he’ll say? I’ll be right back. How is it? - Fine. - So! - That’s strange – sniffing glue. - Never tried it? - I don’t intend to. - Can’t really say it tastes good. What else can you tell me? - Well... Why did you come to our school? - I wanted you to tell me something. - What exactly? - See, that’s better. She was like a palace in this concrete town. A palace among apartment buildings. A milady among pretty girls. - What happened? - I’m fine. I’ve got to go. Sorry. - I’ll give you a tissue. - Hey, Jānis! What happened? - It’s fine. - Just press on it and go. Erection - Uterus. Cervix. Here we see the menstrual cycle day by day. And here is the middle phase. So, once again if anyone missed it. These are outer and inner labia. And the clitoris or love button. Why are you laughing now? At yourselves? Next, of course, we’ll talk about the male genitalia. Like women, men have both inner and outer organs. The outer are – testicles… - How about your nose? …scrotum and penis. As we also know, any other term for this organ is vulgarity. Right, Kārlis? - Yes. That’s right, teacher! The penis performs two important functions. First – it releases urine through the urethra. Second – it releases sperm. And, as Kārlis surely knows, these things can’t happen simultaneously. - I haven’t tried it. - And I’d be really happy if girls didn’t write that children are born through the anal opening. - I wouldn’t be surprised if Kārlis thinks that kids are born through the anal opening. - Hey, do you know which class is next? - Don’t forget to rewrite your test on Thursday! - I know, teacher! Chemistry I think. - Yes, chemistry. - You’re strange. - Why? - Do your really like this music? - Mum, what are you doing? Stop, what are you doing? Give it back! - What’s the matter with you? What was that? - That’s Kristīne’s tape. - Who’s Kristīne? - It’s not mine. Yahoo and Amazon were launched in 1994. But not in Jelgava. Someone had slipped some Polish grunge into the "Nirvana" casette case! - Hey! Hey! - Hey! - Let us in. - The window. - Let us in. Fuck, couldn’t you do that outside? - No. There were people there. - Hi! - Hi! - What are you doing here? Fuck, how’s he gonna get in? He’s got the drinks. How did you get in? - I’ve got a stamp. - Speak up! - I’ve got a stamp. - Really? - Yes. - Can you help our pal out? He hasn’t got the money for a ticket. - Can’t he climb in through the window? - No. He’s waiting by the entrance. - Come on, be our hero, our angel! Go! - I can try. - Don’t try. Do it! - Your stamp? Stamp! Go! - You’re the one who needs to get in? - Finally. Why are you just standing there? Show me the stamp! Hold it! - Wanna a drink! It’s a screwdriver. - What’s your name? - Jānis. - Jānis! - Jānis! - What’s going on here? What’s going on? - Commando camp. - Who are you? - I’m from School No.4. - Looks like it. Are you alone? - For now. But I’m open to a relationship. - Get out of here, now. Stupid teenagers! - Wanna swap? Go home! It’s all over now. - Jānis! Jānis! What’s wrong? Come inside! - Finally. Mum said she’d confiscate your guitar. I told mum that you’ drunk juice and that someone had spiked it with vodka or something like that. - Well! Can you pull yourself together? Hold on here. - Yes. - We’re about to visit grandma. We should've been there already. - I’ll be with you in a second. - Wait, wait, wait! You’re staying home. You have to clean up after yourself. Inga, let’s go! - Yes? - Hey, kid! Come to the Shittery. - I don’t know where that is. - By the Palace. - Who’s calling? - It’s me... Death. There’s an island and a palace on it. It was once home to French King Louis XVIII, and Cagliostro stayed there. Nowadays, the descendants of kings and dukes meet up at the Shittery. - To cut a long story short. There was once a kid in America. It happened recently. He took a shotgun, put the barrel in his mouth and said: “I can do the same as Cobain!” And it went off. - I’ll stuff something else in your mouth. - I can do it like Cobain! - Cobain sang all his life with the gun in his mouth. They didn’t fit in in the new, free and brave Latvia, where one and all measured youth, freedom and courage according to wealth. So I decided to be one one of them. One of the misfits in plaid shirts, who are society’s enemies. - You banged your head in the sink the moment you we’re born! - We have to show real “fuck you” to them all. - Horses! - They’ve got real dicks! - The old Opel seat. There’s always some spring sticking up your ass. - It would be better to kick the bucket than live in this shitty world. Beer “Good morning”, wine “Riddle”, “Holywood” – cigarettes, which cost thirty two santims a pack. If the sun shone too brightly, we got wasted. Pitch black was our favourite colour. - Kaspars, when are you finally going to take a look at that window? - It keeps on coming open. He has looked at it! Get it fixed! Listen, if you don’t show up for work one day, nobody will notice. Nobody pays you there anyway. - We were promised it. I already told you. - Promises, promises... Take Jānis and fix it. Teach him something! You saw for yourself the state he was in when he got back from the disco. That rug should go in the trash can. - What do you mean? Do you even know who he’s out on the streets with? What he listens to? What the heck is going on? - He’s at that age. - Age? Do you think it’s normal that he comes home drunk and listens to garbage. Do you want him to grow up to be a lush? You should have spoken to him man to man. You don’t know how to deal with it. You can’t raise your only son as a man. - Stop it! - Do you have dreams that repeat themselves? - Not really. - I’ve got one, where I’m walking along the school corridor and all the kids start laughing at me. They just go on laughing. And then the dream ends. - That’s strange. - Yes, and I’m over thirty years old in that dream. - I don’t have dreams like that. - Go home everybody! - Jānis, who’s the main character in the film? - The main character is... - Who? - Is... - Kurt Cobain? Is he going to help you pass your exams? - No. - The main character of the film is Kristīne. - Kristīne, we usually stand up when answering. - The main character is Kristīne. - Why? - Because she has to decide who to marry. - She has an inner conflict. Who did that? Kārlis, was that you? - No. - Jānis? - Idiot! - Go outside. - Why? I won’t. - Because. Out of the classroom! - Stay brutal! - We’ll continue watching the film. My God, how those hallways stank! Some completely horrid floor wax! The toilets stank too. But that’s fine. - Don’t throw it on the ground. - You’re wearing a really pretty skirt today. That was the stench of secrets. - Oh, right. You were with Žanis. - Yeah, we went to that party. I told you. The day before yesterday. It was cool. We danced, and I got completely wasted. - What did you drink? - The stuff they gave me. - Got you! - Hey! - Your hand’s wet, man. - Practicing? - What’re you talking about? - Why the hell is your hand wet? - Who do you like kissing better – your hand or a girl? But you’re right. You get some practice, otherwise you’ll meet a girl and won’t know what to do. - Yeah! You’re so skilled, man! - Wait, give me a beer! How many did you take? - If you had balls, you’d jump. - Want a beer? We could come back in twenty years to see what it’ll look like then. I reckon all those buildings will’ve been torn down. There’ll be skyscrapers here. - In twenty years we’ll all be dead. - Nothing’s going to get torn down. It will be the same old shit. - I don’t know about you, but I’ll live in London. - And I plan on drinking. - My life will be so cool. - Hey, look what shit I found on the street. - Play with it. Do some more handiwork. - Will you open it? - Go fuck yourselves! - Dude! - What was that sound? - You think we did that? - Go and have a look. - What is that, huh? What is that? Is this your shit? - No. - Hey! Butt fucker! Have you ever met any gays? Let’s get out of here! - What are you, complete faggots? - Pass me the tape! - Maybe you should create a band of your own? Think about it, Jelgava’s already got "Husqvarn"! - Yeah. I know a guy who lives next door. He’s a drummer, really good. He’s played in concerts in Riga. We talked about starting something together. Jānis, could you play the guitar? - He doesn’t know how. - He does. Jānis is cool. - I could, yeah. What are you gonna do? - Scream in the microphone. - You know, if we’re starting a band, I could design the logo. Some kind of a demon, a monster. Like "Cannibal Corpse". But what style? - Death metal, man. - Only death metal, man. - You can’t sing. - You’ve got to yell there. - You don’t know how to yell. - Yeah, but your mom does! - You know what the group could be called – "Slimy Udders"! - No, no, no way. - That’d be a funny, right? - Metal is no joke. The band. First, it’ll become the best known in Jelgava, then in Latvia and, later on, all over the world. We’ll strum guitars so our fingers bleed and our fans lick up our blood! - Out of tune? - I play metal. - Metal? This is guitar for metal! - Can I try? - Stay brutal! - Death! - Why aren’t we going up? - Why are you yelling? - Come down! - Not now. - Why? - Come on. - Later, dudes. - Let’s go up! - What’s going on? What do you want? - Why are you yelling? Go away. - What’s going on? - Why are you yelling? I’ve got visitors. - Are you pushing me? - Get back inside! - Watch it! - What do you want? - What, what? Let’s go to the Exchange. - Close the door, there’s a draught. - Wait! And stop yelling! Wait for me downstairs, I’ll be right down. - Finally. You OK? - Give me a smoke! - It’s ok, man. - Get lost. Let’s go hitchhiking. - Where the fuck you going? - To dig you a grave! - You come, leave and go away! - Fine, see you tomorrow! - What do you mean “fine”? Idiot. - Yes. - You have to be there. Do you like the car? - Yes, very much. - Yes. - Very elegant. - What are you, metalheads? - No. - What kind of music do you listen to? - "Cannibal Corpse". Translation – "Fairy Wings". - What makes you think I don’t know what that means? Why don’t you listen to normal music? I know why. You don’t want to be normal. - Stop it! - You think you are smarter than everyone else. - Perhaps we are? - If someone’s well-off , you reckon he’s either sold out or a thief. Let those idiots drive us. Let them buy us beers. We just want to listen to "Cannibals". That’s it. We have arrived. - But, but we’re not in Riga yet. - I said we’ve arrived! - Let’s walk back! We’ll go there another day. - The Exchange is only open on Sundays. - The Exchange! How do you know it even exists? - Somebody told me. - How do you know it even exists? - You shouldn’t listen to others so much. Look, there’s Ugo. - Good afternoon! - Hello! - Hey! - Can you take us to Jelgava? - Aren’t we going to the Exchange? - What Exchange? - Get in from another side. This door is not working. - Just move! - Come on, Death! - Are you coming? - No way. - Be careful with the money! Don’t lose it in Riga. - Bye, cowboy! - Excuse me! - What? - Is the Exchange at the end of this line? - We’re going to Mežciems. - Excuse me. How can I get to the Exchange? - Ask the driver. Fucked if I know! The Exchange. The meeting place of melomaniacs and metalomaniacs. In the forest. Beyonnd the last stop on Mežciems’ trolleybus line. Original tapes were either expensive or impossible to get hold of. But you could find all the best music at the Exchange, rerecorded onto ninety minute tapes. Here you got the feeling that you had the world at your feet no pine needles. The world didn’t know we were here. And we couldn’t care less about the world. They were there too. - What happened to him? - He was steeling?? - How can one just steal smokes like that? Just imagine. - Really? - And the next day there was another rock concert. - The same band? - Yeah. And all the young people who showed up at the train station were arrested. - Did they allow them to play after the first concert? - The next concert was very wooden. - I see. - What does the young man want? - Hello! - Hello! - Have you got the album “Last Man On Earth” by “Asphyx”? - I’ve got “Asphyx”. What d’you want on the other side? - I don’t know. - Here, take a look. “Kill The Bride Who Got Away”. - “My Dying Bride”, “Turn Loose the Swans”. - What’s your name? - Jānis. - One lat from you. I’ll record it, you’ll get it next week. - But I’m from Jelgava. - Well, congratulations! “The Grindmasters” are gonna play in that shithole of yours soon! I mean the Junkyard. This is the only thing I can give you today. - It’s good. - You bet. - And then those Australians, what were they called – “Destroyers 666”. They were cool. Their lead singer thought he was a vampire, but his girlfriend didn’t believe him. And so he really sunk his teeth into her. - Really? - Do you play anything? - Guitar. - Cool. Then we’ll hear about you soon. Ok, see you later! - Bye! We have received information from the Ministry of the Interior. Over eighty prisoners have escaped. - We have received a lot of calls. The Latvian people are frightened by the situation. - But are there any dangerous criminals among them? - There are rapists. There are some who have committed murders... - Give me back the player! - Wait. After this song. - I’m waiting. - Fuck you! - Leave the classroom! - Jānis! Come on, dear! We’ll walk. - Wait! Let’s push it! - One more? - Think about it, you invest two hundred lats in the starter kit. And in a week, you earn it back tenfold. - Come on! Let’s have a drink! - If we both got involved, the whole of Jelgava is gonna buy this shampoo. Here comes the younger generation! - Good afternoon! - Want a drink? - Dad, can I have one lat? - Forget it. Here, have two. - Wait. He doesn’t deserve it. - Why not? - That’s why. Get lost, Janis. - Come on, stop it. - Go on, get out! - Stop it! - Why do you keep pushing him around? He always doing that. What will become of him? You should have fixed the window in his room instead. - Lāsma, we’re talking business here. - Business? - Yes. - Are you gonna buy it? - Of course. - With what? How are you going to buy it? They’re no longer paying him wages! He’s going there to work for free, God knows why. Do you know what our boy did at school? - Mum! - What? - Can you give me one lat? - I’m broke. Ask the businessman. - I don’t. - I told you, get lost! - The only thing he knows how to say is “Get lost!”. - Yeah, I’m working on him too. - Yeah. I see. “Get lost!” What kind of language is that? His son told the teacher to fuck off. Can you imagine? - Stop it! - Just like that. But he doesn’t have the time to talk to him. And I’ve got to do everything myself. I’ll have to fix the window, too. He’s only got time for his Lada... - Why are you walking in the water? - Just for the sake of it. - Can someone open this? - Open it with a lighter. - We have a gift! Sit down! - What is that? - And then the solo. - You’ll have to play like this, dude! We can be better than them. - I want to drink! Give me something to drink! - Is everyone going to the Junkyard tomorrow? - Who’s not going? - Next time it’ll be us playing as well, right, Death? - Do you have a band? - Yeah, we’ve got a band. - Who is in it? - Since when? - Eva is our… what are you, Eva? - I’m the manager? - Do you have any songs? - Yeah. - Play something! - We’re still practicing. - Since when? Next time in Junkyard will be our first performance. - Stupid Zombie. - He’s a moron. - Did you know about the Junkyard? - Who didn’t? It’s gonna be the biggest metal event that’s ever happened in Jelgava. It’s gonna be wild! But what about your guitar? - Fine, I’m playing. - I meant the electric. - I don’t know yet. Haven’t found anyone who’s selling. - If you don’t get the guitar, we’ll have to look for someone else. - No. I’ll try to get it. Kristīne! Where are you going? - Hi! - Hi! - I’m going home. - Oh, I left the party to go to the Gypsies, to buy some weed. I just hope they don’t beat me up. I didn’t pay last time. - Cool. - We’ll see. I’ll get the weed; the party is pretty crazy. We’ve got drinks like “Mercury” and “Satan”. - Dude, what do you want from me? - What? Nothing. - Nothing, really? - I just thought maybe you’d like to have a smoke or something. - You know I don’t smoke. - I didn’t know. I share with everyone. With everyone. - You share. - Yes. - Why don’t you do anything? Are you ever capable of moving your mouth and talking? - Are you a fucking idiot? I’ll break your legs! - What is it? The hot water gets cut off at ten. Oh, blood! A real metalhead, huh? Come in my mum’s room. Just don’t break anything. Lie down. Don’t get it on anything! Mum’ll think that someone popped their cherry. - What’s going on? Did you hit him? - Almost killed him. - What’s with him? - Nothing. He’ll give birth. - Let’s have a drink! - Let’s go! - Girls, is Chemistry class there? - Where’s Chemistry? - What Chemistry? - We’ve got a test. - What test? Fuck off! - What are you laughing about? - Hey! - There’s Ugo. Yo! - Hey! - Fuck off! - Wanna fight? - What, huh! Come on! What? Is that funny, faggot? - You still mad at me? - Yeah. So what? Take it, punk! - Go off and die! - With pleasure! Hey. Are you going to the Junkyard? - Of course. - I’ll buy you a couple of beers. They’ll help you forget that stupid jacket. - I miss back when I didn’t know you. - Ladies, wanna eat some sunflower seeds? - You bald fuck, are you bald down there, too? - Want your teeth punched out? - Did you shave your twat, you pussy? - Fuck off, cocksucker! - Oh shit! Almost broke my leg. - I’ll be right back. Wait here. - Will you be long? - No, just a minute. - Where were you? - At school. - Why are you lying? - I’m not. - Where were you? My sweetheart! Where were you, sweetie? - Jānis, where did you spend the night? - Answer, when they ask you! - I was at Zomb... at Edgars’. - Jānis. I want you to understand something. Drinking and smoking with grown men is no joke. - You were the best in the class and part of the writer’s club. You were great at it. I’d really like you to, despite your teenage years, which is normal... - Let me speak... - ...To find new interests as a teenager. - I am very, very disappointed. - But you should... - Dear colleague, let me explain what we mean. We have had quite a few graduates, honour students, who I run into five years after graduation. They drift around Jelgava, get drunk behind the garages, peeing their pants and begging for money at the bus station. - And did you give him some money? - So! Jānis, I really hope... - I hope you’ll get out of this town, out of this province... - Wait. Listen, there’s nothing wrong with Jelgava. - Of course there isn’t. - This is not about that. - Jānis, Jānis! - What are the chances here? - Wait! - Where will he study? The Agricultural Academy? - Why did the poet Aspazia leave Jelgava? - Hey! - Hi! - Sorry, guys, wait a bit longer! I’ll be right down. - We’ve been waiting for twenty minutes. - I know, I’ll be right down. There’s a bit of a hitch here. - If you don’t fancy coming to the Junkyard, just say so. - I’m coming guys... - Why are you yelling? - Haven’t you had enough? Going somewhere? - No! - You’re not going anywhere for a long time, you understand? - Yes. - Close that window! Shut it! - You going somewhere? - Yes! To the Junkyard. - How are you gonna get out of the house? What are you going to do? Jānis! No! - Don’t move! I’ll be right there! - That was something! Did you see that? Listen! Are you alive? - Fuck, how are you, kid? - Let’s take him. - Why? Why the fuck? Leave him. - Come on, come on. Get up! - Are you an asshole? Fuck, leave him! - Let’s go. He’s broken his leg. Come on, take him! Take him, are you dumb? Help me! Let’s take him to the car. - Where are you taking me? I am fine. - Come on, come on! - Fuck! Shut up! - Where are you taking me? - Take your hand off. Sit quietly! - Where are we taking him? - Are you an idiot! Where? Let’s just drive. - Fuck! - Let’s get rid of him. - Why the fuck do you need this? - Please, just let me out! - Shut up! - What do you mean by “let me out”? You need help. - Where are we taking him? - Let’s take him to hospital and then we’re free. - Do you want to go back to jail? - Just calm down! - Fuck! - It’s fine, they’ve gone. - Hey, pretty girl! - Well... - We’re going to the river later. Come with us. Play some guitar, grill some meat. - We’re not taking her. - You fucker, I’ll show you. I’m sick of your shit. - I can’t tonight anyway, I’ve got plans. - She’s not only beautiful, but smart, too. Look at her! - No way! - Wait! Hey, watch it! Don’t spoil the car. Are you gonna make it? - It’s fine. Thanks. - Have fun, kids. - Happy? - Bye! - Kristīne, wait! - Why should I? - Come on, Kristīne! What are you doing today? - “Darrva” is gonna play. - Hey! - Hi! Hi! - Hey! - Hey! - What’s with your leg? Is it broken? - He jumped out of the fourth floor. - Third. - Third? He was picked up by a car. - Yeah. By two skinheads. - He broke his leg. - Some prisoners picked him up. - I swear on all that is evil in my soul. - Hi, guitarist! - Fuck off! - I swear on all that is evil in my soul. - What’s wrong, Janis! - Fuck off! - Stop it! Get in! - It is so heavy that I don’t understand a thing. - We could play like that, maybe even heavier. - Great, I found some meat! - If you played in a band, you’d get Kristīne. - I’m not interested in her. - Yeah, right! Hold it! - Let’s go up and talk. - Well. - I feel bad that we broke up like that. - We didn’t break up. - No? - Dude, we’ve never been an item. - Well, yeah. But it’s not fair. - What exactly isn’t fair? Me and you, us... Kristīne, we have something out of this time, out of this city. We, we are like Jelgava Palace, like an ugly baroque misunderstanding that’s fallen deep into a concrete whirlpool. - Do you even know how to talk? - This battle took place in 1236. “The Battle at Saule”. - Hello! Where’s Death? - I don’t know. With Zombie. - Have you seen Death? - Somewhere downstairs. - Let’s go look. I didn’t think that was growing up. But I definitely learned something. When you’ve got a broken heart and the world collapses around you, then your leg doesn’t hurt anymore. That’s when you hear the real sound of metal. - Mum, stay, I’ll go with Dad. - Yo, fuckwit! Do you wanna give head? - Those your friends? - With that leg – I doubt it. What’s going to happen now? - Some shit will happen. - I wish my folks had a Lada! - I wish I had parents. - Easy now, take it easy. - Slowly, slowly. He’s in pain. Stay. Stay in the car. - Stay brutal! - Yeah, man! - Show me! - Show me yours!
