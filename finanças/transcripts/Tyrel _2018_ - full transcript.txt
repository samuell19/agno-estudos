Oh, shit. Wait. Who you beeping at, dawg? Who you beeping at, son? Oh, man. Wait, can you live with no kidneys? I think you can. Nah, man, I don't think that's true. I think you need at least one. - Shit. - That's what dialysis is for, though, right? Yeah, man, but she doesn't want to live depending on that shit. - You know, like... - Yeah. She keeps pissing herself, she can't barely walk, not long ago, she couldn't even recognize Carmen. Her own fucking daughter. Whoa, wait, this is Carmen's mom? Yeah, what the fuck were you talking about? Nah, I thought it was her grandma. Exactly! She's not that old, man. - Shit. - But... old enough to make her own decisions, you know? Shit, is Carmen losing it? That's fucked up. She's broken, for sure, but I'm like "Baby, your mom has the right to decide... to do what she wants," you know? To be treated or not. I mean... Nobody wants to spend their last days locked in some hospital or... You know, if she doesn't want to go through dialysis then she shouldn't have to do it. Yeah, I know, but what if she lives like 10 more years? You know? And then her kids gotta take care of her, like that, for like 10 more years, and they're super stressed out, and Carmen gets more and more stressed out, and that makes you stressed out. You know what I mean? Yeah, I can't take no more of this shit either, man. - This entire fucking... - Man, this is so... - ...family's stressed out. - Yeah. Everybody's psycho. All she thinks about is her mom, like, kicking the bucket. - Yeah. - You know, we haven't had sex in like two months, my nuts are about to explode. Fucking crazy. - Oh, wait, wait, wait. - Uh-oh. - Yo, we low key. - We got roll, baby. We got roll. Right, you're gonna have to steer hard. Right. Well, hopefully the family can convince her now, right? Shit, good luck with that. She's just as stubborn as Carmen. Yo, she's coming towards us. Hey! Uh-oh, here she comes. - Hi! - Hi, how are you? What happened? Did you run out of gas? Yes, ma'am, my trusted co-pilot here thought we'd make it by now, but he got a little - turned around in the process. - It's my fault. My husband has the car or I'd help you, I'm so sorry. Oh, it's fine. It's okay, our friends are coming, they live nearby. - They're gonna be here any minute. - Where are you... - Where are you going? - Uh, 300 Peekamoose. Oh, that's just down the road. - Yeah, I know. - It's the two blue houses, - side by side. Yeah. - Exactly. You're visiting the Argentinean fellow? - Nico. - Nico, that's it. - Very nice! - Sweetheart. Yeah, wonderful guy. I hadn't had the chance to meet him yet. - Ah, good. - So yeah, we'll see how that goes. Yeah sure, sure. So where are you coming from? - Oh, just in the city. - New York City? Yes, ma'am. Yeah, good, good. - Yeah. - Not too far. - Yeah. - Just up for a weekend. - Right, right, right. - Good, I'm Silvia. - Oh, Tyler! - Ah, pleasure! - Pleasure to meet you. - Yeah, pleasure.

Yeah, for sure, for sure, for sure. - How the fuck you doing? - I'm good, man. - I'm good. Damn, you look good. - Good to see you. Good to finally meet you. We met at the restaurant, right? - Yeah, I think so. - Yeah, we met before. At Chivo's? So you met at Chivo's? What's he talking about, good to meet me? What's that shit? He don't remember me? - I don't know, dude. - You got it? Hey. You don't... you don't remember me? Pete, stop. - No, no I don't. - This face? I wasn't wearing the hat, I apologize. - No, I'm sorry, man. I don't. - Motherfucker. Can you shake it a little bit? Shake the car. Yeah. What's wrong with the car? - Is this your car? - Yeah, yeah. So you really don't remember me, huh? Over at Chivo's? Dude, you kidding me with this? Let it go. - No. - You got it wrong. First of all, it was Chilo's. Motherfucker, and I told you... I told you on the phone. Peach Pit, Peach Pit is our new place. It's a new place, new location, you know? Yeah. Peach Pit. Nah, it's actually Peach Pip. You see how much he loves me? Peach Pit, Your name's Peach, huh? - Peach, motherfucker. - Peach. Yeah, like the fruit. My grandmother's name was Peaches - and she, um... - Oh, yeah? Yeah, and she... she gave me all the recipes. You know? So it's kind of like a play on words what we did there, yeah. - Oh. That's cool. - Yeah, things are going pretty good. It's like our own spin on Southern cuisine, but... People, like, really love our famous meats. We smoke our meats for like 15 hours. - No shit. - Mm- hmm. - It's a recipe for Fabian, too. - Still. Fuck me, man. No shit, dude, like that 15- hour smoked. So when can I get a taste, huh? Hey, whenever you ready, man. I suggest you come down and get your life changed, you know? - - I'm sorry man, I didn't mean nothing. I thought I met you over there at the Chi... Chilo's. Chilo's. - No, man. - I'm sorry, man. - Well, actually... - You look familiar. So, how'd you get roped into this shit? Well, we had... my girl has some... some family driving - from Syracuse. - Uh-huh? My house is, like, full of people right now. I don't even have a bed to sleep in in my own apartment, so... - I really appreciate you having me. - No, man. A friend of Johnny's is a friend of mine. Figure it out? All right. Fuck. Hey, Max, can you get the dog? Yeah, I got the dog. Thanks, man. I like the dog better than you guys. Look at the white baby! This is my inflatable girlfriend. - You guys seen this? - Nico, why do you have this? I got it, I found it in the attic, okay? - You found it, it was here? - Yeah. - This was here? Just like that? - Yeah. It's so fucking big. But I don't know, I think it has a hole or something. - Let me try it out. - Oh, my God. I'm gonna try that again. Check it out. Yeah, I'm going to tie him up over here. Hey, can you, uh... - can you show them the rooms? - Yeah. Hey, take off your shoes! - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Take them off. - This is Nico's room. - Oh, wow! - He painted the floors white. - I know, - he hates it, though. - Looks really good. - It gets dirty too fast. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was Nina's idea, though. She likes everything white. And I'll be sleeping with him, so, uh... there's this blow up mattress. One of you guys can blow that up. Aw, we're not sharing a bed? - Baby, not this time. - No! - I know! - No! And then over here, this is Max's room, - but he snores like a motherfucker. - Right. And I don't know whose room this is, but just take it. - Okay. - And find out if someone, - you know... - So... are we sharing a bed? I'm not sharing a bed! Mm-mm. What do you mean you're not sharing a bed? Not with any straight dudes, anyway. What's wrong with us? The only man I'm going to sleep with is one I can - put my arms around... - I'd put my arms around you. ...and hump from behind. - I'd come from behind you. - Not a straight man is exactly what I'm saying. Back off! Maybe I'll wiggle a little less. The thingy is Netgear45 and the password's on the -- in the... on the fridge. - On top of the fridge. - Thank you. Yeah, dude. So basically, her hair is gone. - She's, it's not, like completely gone... - It's falling off - in clumps. - It's falling off slowly. - She's losing her hair? - But get this. Get this. - Why? - Tell him, tell him why. So Stella is this woman who is fucking every single married guy that she knows. She's been breaking every single home. And because of that, she's losing her hair? She's got the evil eye, and the evil eye is making her lose her hair. What is evil eye? What is evil eye? - It's like a curse. - Someone cursed her? So, Francesca... so she fucked Francesca's husband... Max, are you making hot toddies? Hottest toddies! Are you on Facebook again, motherfucker? I had to "like" some shit. Right, but you fucked Stella too? - Hmm? - You fucked Stella? - Nah, she only has this thing with married men. - Don't lie. - I just came here. - No, that's not true, she'd fuck anybody. She'd fuck him. I'm down. Can I get her number, man? You're down now... Toddy! You get a toddy, you get a toddy, and you get a toddy. I'm like the fucking Oprah of toddies over here, right? - Maxine, you're a doll. - These are famous. - Oh, yeah. - Mmm. Mm! Don't burn yourself. This is a fine fucking time to tell me. I'm sorry. No. I'm joking, man. I'm joking. You know, like, when people trip and you're like, "Watch out!" like, after the fact, like? Okay. - It's true. - I'll remember that. You good? Why Toddy, though? Who even is Toddy? Like, why? It's like some Irish faggot. Just look it up, - or something like that. - Hey! Hey! - What? - Who said faggot? Dude, I didn't mean it in, like, a derogatory sense. So, Roddy, what's the etymology of the word faggot? - What does it mean, exactly? - You know what? That's not your question. "It rubs the lotion on the skin, or else it gets the hose again." Shit, man, that's so fucking ignorant. - Chinese, Chinese... - So easy. Yes! Chinese! You guys are assholes, you know that? - Clearly. - Yeah! Let me go, let me go! I'll go, I'll go! Fuck you. - Yeah, fuck you too, motherfucker. - Go Max, go. All right, all right, c'mon. - Okay, all right. - What? Um... "It puts the lotion on its skin, or else it gets the hose again." - Nope. - A dead person. - Nope. - I want ano... Nobody knows what that is, that doesn't mean anything. - All right, all right. - It wasn't Canadian? - It's dead in the water. - It was Indian. It was Indian. For your information, in case you wanted to know. - Who's next? - Me? Yeah, you John. All right. Oh. What? "It rubs... it rubs lotion on its skin - or else it gets..." - Bjork! - Yeah! - That Bjork was so good. All right. - Not bad. - That was so good! Bro, I didn't know you could act! Yeah, you're good, man. - A'ight, a'ight. - Thanks, guys. - All right, Ty. - No, man. - Yo, just go. - I'm good, man. - Come on, man. - You know, it's not me. I was terrible, man. It'll be fine, go. Yo, I don't like games either, I get it. - Roddy, shut the fuck up! - Don't do it. You don't have to do it. - He doesn't have to do it. - Oh, my goodness. Okay. - This is so stupid. - You got it. Um... "It rubs the lotion on its skin, - or else it gets the ho-- " - Pete: British! Boom! Boom! There you go! - It's British! - I hear you. It was all right. Okay. All right, Roddy, you've gotta try it, man. You've gotta try it. Both of us hate games, it's only right. Okay, now this is ignorant. All right? "It rubs the lotion on its skin, or else it gets the hose again." - American accent. - What's that, a gay accent? Yeah. No, but that was yourself though, right? Black accent. What does that even mean? - You know what I mean, come on. - You wrote this? You have to be more specific than that. Are you kidding? All right, all right, my bad. My bad. Like a... Like an old black lady from, like, New Orleans or something, you know? - Mm, nuh-uh, no. - No? What do you mean, no? - It's a thing. - I don't know. - It's a valid accent. - I'm done. Sorry. Hey! Come on, come on, come on. I don't know. Pardon the... This is stupid. - It's stupid. - No, Roddy, come on. Just do the old black lady from New Orleans. - He approves. - It's cool. You know, it's not that. It's just, I don't act. - Okay? - Come on, Roddy. Yo, son, Ty, you show him how to do it. - Yo! Wassup! - Yeah, son! You teach him. You teach him how to do it. - You want me to do it? - Yeah, show us how it's all done. Damn, all right. "Rubs lotion on its skin, or else it gets the hose again. Shit." Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, man. - What the fuck? No. - Yeah, whoa, whoa, whoa. - No. - No? Then you fucking do it then, dude. Geez. I asked you first. Don't put me on the spot. I don't think Tyler approves. All right. No. I'm no... No! - Just do it! - What am I supposed to say? - Like a black accent? - Show them how to... Do us the fucking old black lady from New Orleans accent, man. - Just do it. Yeah. - With the black accent? Okay. It's dumb, come on. Tyler! Man. Don't be a pussy, motherfucker. You've got it! "All right, you put the lotion on your skin, look, baby. All right? On its skin, 'scuse me. All right? You rub it in real good. All over, you rub it in. Or else you're gonna get the hose again." It's just, you know, it's simple. You know? - That's good. - That was great, man. I like you. Okay. Okay, come on. Let's, uh... Let's play another fucking game, uh... Yes! Please. Can I...? Give me a beer. Yeah, yeah. Fuck that game. Let's play a new game. You, uh... What's that fucking, uh...? Oh, uh... Talk about nothing! - The Wikipedia game. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Talking without knowing! - Talk about knowing. - Talk without knowing! You ever played this game? Tyler. Basically, we give you a subject, something like that, and then you've got to bullshit it. But you've got to sound a professional as possible. Even if you don't know it, you've got to pretend - that you know your shit. - Okay! Roddy, sex change. Sex change? Sex change, sex change. So we're dealing with the clitoris, which is already engorged, because of the hormones, but we've further enhanced the new penis with a graft of skin taken from the body, preferably from a place with no hair. Make the bigger penis and then we take the labia and form it into a ball sack, if you will. And voilà. - A new penis. - You're a genius! - Bravo! - Thank you. - All right, all right. - Beautiful. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Did you cheat? Did you look it up on Wikipedia? I got you, I got you. Hey! Hey! Hey! Tyler! Tyler! Black holes. - Ooh! - Black holes. - This is good. This is good. - DeGrasse. - Who's his name? - I'm not... I don't even understand, man. - Neil DeGrasse Tyson, dude. - Neil DeGrasse Tyson! Sound like that motherfucker. You seen that shit? I'm good, man, I don't... I'm good. That's why I named my dog that shit. - I'm gonna sit this one out. - Come on! - Why can't I just sit this one out? - Tyler! - That's a fun one. - Come on, we all fucking, we all looking like jackasses, man. That's the whole fucking point. Come on, it's a fun subject. This is a fun one, just do it. Um, okay. Um... Black holes. Black holes are a... a place in... - in space... - Yeah? ...where space meets the next space of dark, and... It's good, keep going. Come on, come on, come on! As a spaceship, it... This is so s... I don't know No, you're doing good, man! You're doing really good! Keep going, - keep going! Come on! - Okay, chill out, dude. What if there was a spaceship? You got a bathroom?

Oh, shit, have you seen the... the movie? The version from the '80s? Nah, but don't... please don't tell me because it's starting off so good. All I can tell you, man, is that it's a rough movie. I think I saw it when I was too young. My dad brought me with my brother. And it was just... I just got traumatized, man. It scarred me, scarred me forever. For good. Sounds like you had a pretty rough fucking childhood. Yeah, motherfucker. It was a pretty fucking rough childhood, man. Fuck you, man. I tell you, man. It's not easy. What we eating? You got any grits or something? - I actually do. - A'ight, good, good, good. It's, uh... It's polenta, though. Need that little southern something so you don't have a little situation this morning. I don't know how to do that, man. Let me get rid of these for you. Don't worry, you have a master chef in the house. - Tell these motherfuckers, man. - Mm-mm. Morning, Papito. This looks great.

Whoa, happy birthday, you look like shit. Yeah, just... - Good morning, man. - How'd you sleep? - Good, man. How about you? - Pretty good. Pretty good. - Thank you. - All for you, all of it. Hey, Nico, is this expired? - What? What is it? - Whipped cream, - is it expired? - I don't know, check the expiration date. - Good morning, my man. - How you doing? I'm good, how about you? Not too tight, not too tight. - I'm doing okay. - Happy birthday, man. - Thank you. - I hope you enjoy. Did you, uh... Did you take part in this? I did! So you finally get to nourish yourself with some of my actual cuisine. You guys want Irish coffee? Irish coffee? - Yeah. - You want one? - Yeah. - Not going to put you to sleep? Not when there's coffee in it, man. Hey, there's no green tea... I'm not gonna tell you when. All right, all right. Nico, baby, you want some? - It's strong, it's very strong. - Nah? Can I get some of that whipped cream? - Can I see that sugar? - Oh, yeah. - Nico. - Tell me when to stop. Fuck man, you put sugar on your grits? - It's polenta. - Same shit! Yeah, you never seen nobody do this before? Yeah, I thought grits was, like, a savory, salt and pepper thing, no? I don't know, man, some people... Is it like a family thing? Nah, some people like it sweet, some people like it salty. I like both, me personally, but, you know, I guess it just depends on what I eat it with. - Right? - But like, it's a war, like, some people really take this serious. Yeah, like, sometimes my Facebook explodes about it. Like, it's super, super crazy. I'll see if I can find something. You wouldn't believe how far this goes. See? They got Angela and Rachel. What was that? Just keep swiping. What's that? What's that? - Oh, Rachel. - Let me see this. That's good. - Let me see that. - But it's an actual... Oh, no! That's funny. Oh, no! - Fucked with Michael. - They got Michael! Now that's funny. That's not really fair, though, is it, man? I mean, the guy's dead. He can't exactly call out on that, can he?

Every single fucking one of you. And that's what this is about, that's what it's all... that's what all of this shit is about. All right? So anyways, that's all I wanted to say. - To the women's march! - Happy birthday. - To the women's march. - You cynical motherfucker! Thank you, Pete, really funny speech!

I just need to take a shower, bro. You wanna take a shower? Come upstairs. It's all right, it's cool. We'll go upstairs and take a shower. Come on. I'll make you some coffee, okay? All right, all right. - You're my babies. - Yeah, go, go. - You're my babies. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go. Take care of yourself. Maybe we should've put some candy in that thing. Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Yo! Hey, my bad. Max is using the bathroom downstairs. Oh, and Nico says you gotta keep the showers short. There isn't much water in the tank, some shit like that, I don't fucking know. Oh, yo, we okay, right? I was just fucking around before, all right? Yeah, we're real. - Yep. - Okay! Shit. Fuck! Bitches! Fuck 'em! Cheap-ass motherfucker. He wrote this note to all these convents in Argentina, like, all these nuns, like, "We have to pray against gay marriage," like "This is the devil's work, this is evil, we have to pray against it," and then seven years later, it was like the church - should apologize to gay people. - Right, right. This is our Pope, he's like the fresh... It's horrible, it's horrible... - Like the fresh, young, cool new Pope... - My man... - You good? - ...like Rolling Stone magazine put him on. You know, just because you're not a Nazi doesn't mean you're a good person. He's going around giving an apology toward people who don't believe in Him and don't care. Ooh. You smell like almonds. You made that coffee? Oh, fuck, yo, I forgot to save you a cup. Oh, no shit. What do you mean, "no shit"? I was just going to make more coffee, man. - Here just, have mine. - Nah, I'm good. Dude, it's fine, here, I'll make a new pot of coffee. - I'm good. - I'll make a new pot of coffee. Would you just take that? Stop being a bitch and drink that, all right? I'll make another pot, don't worry. We got any more coffee? The imagery of it is all bloody. If Jesus were here, he would fucking be over it himself. Oh, my God, he would hate it! He would hate it! It's all just a bunch of rapey bullshit. If Jesus went into a church, he'd be like, "What the fuck are you doing? Why am I bleeding, with a thorny crown...?" Like, "Put me on rollerblades!" It's like a horror show! Absolutely, I know! Ty. Remember when we were all having fun? Now it's turned into a fucking fiasco. I know! It always does. That's where it always goes. It's like religion, politics, religion, politics. - This is what happens. - Yo Alan. What are you doing? Why do you have that? What is that? The fucking hoarders that lived here had it. - What are you doing, man? - They had like ten of them. - Here. - I can't with you guys. Why haven't you thrown it away? Okay, so, like, what is happening here? Like, why is it so scary? This baby's like a demon baby. He's, like, about to take a bite out of her face. No, you know what, come in the living room - if you want to have fun, okay? - What is this? Why is he about to take a bite out of her? And, like, the baby doesn't weigh anything. - It's like they're gonna make out or something. - Yeah! What about the Jesus? The unfuckable Jesus right there? Why is Jesus always with a lamb? Like, what does the lamb mean? It means nothing! It means its mother's missing. Like, Tyler, why... what is this? Is Jesus running a petting zoo? What are you supposed to think when you see this? Why, in 2017 are people, like, in love with this imagery? - Why is it 2017 in the first place? - Yeah! Like, why are people posting this to their wall and crying? Anyone who believes in this kind of Jesus must be, like, an inferior human. I don't want these people voting, or touching me... Let's hire an actor... Guys, why don't we go to the fire and burn all this shit? Please, can I just ask, no more Cuba stories? But still! I mean, I get you guys went to Cuba. Ty, Ty! Is he still going off in there? It's what he does. He just goes on and on and on... Burn! Burn! We brought the Jesus and we'll watch Him burn! Burn the witch! We're going to burn him! - No, no! - Yes! Burn! No, no. Not a good idea!

Come in, come in. - Are you sure? - Come on, come in, it's freezing. Come on. Thank you so much. So what... what happened? You found the house? Ye... Yeah. Well, I found the house, but... Nico had a bunch of people coming there and... Yeah. Just... people were sharing beds and I... I... I just couldn't find anywhere to sleep. Okay. Would you like some coffee? I think that would be a good idea. Right? So why don't you go sit down? - Right there. - Thank you so much. This is a nice house. You're so nice for this. Thank you so much. Yeah, I wanna hear... I wanna hear the rest of the story. So... Yeah, so I come outside, right? - Yeah. - And a bunch of people were there, so my car was blocked in... - Uh-huh. - So I was like... I... I... I don't know, I just came here... What is going on? - Oh, honey, this is... - Who's this? Oh, yeah, uh... What is your name? Do I know your name? - Tyler. Yes, Ma'am. - Oh, Tyler, Tyler! Of course. How you doing, sir? This is Nico's friend, the Argentinean fellow on the corner who bought the Jenkins' place. The Jenkins' place. Nico. Good, so, what are you doing here at 11 o'clock at night? - I'm sorry, I was... - No, honey, you don't have to stand up, sit down, sit down. - I'll get you some coffee... - He's drunk, and he needs to leave. All right, honey, let's just - let him have his coffee... - You know, maybe - this was a bad idea... - ...this is my guest. - I'm so sorry. - No, just sit down. - Sit down, sit down. - I'm so sorry, guys. Well I'm not going to leave you alone with some random drunk guy. Okay, I'm going to get your coffee. So, Tyler, are you the only one who couldn't sleep? Tyler, honey? - Tyler. - Huh? Were you the only one that wasn't able to sleep? Oh... Oh... Oh, thank you so much for this! - Careful. Don't burn yourself! - Mm! - Mom, what is going on? - Devon, honey, what are you doing up? I can't sleep when you play that dang thing. All right. Do you want to say hello to our friend here? - Who's he? - How you doing? I'm Tyler. - Hi. - Tyler. How you doing? - What's your name? - Devon. - Devon. - Nice fur. Oh, thank you, you want to touch it? Thank you. - It's not mine. - Let's go to sleep, - what do you figure? - Goodnight, Devon. - Nice to meet you. - Have a great night. And the "dang thing" is called a baritone saxophone, kiddo. - I thought you were reading? - I was... Um... Great kid. You know, maybe... maybe it's best I just go ahead. What, you don't like music? Music is... I just... Like, I was... I just really feel like maybe it's best I just go ahead and go, you know? I think that's a good idea, son. All right, thank you. Thank you for everything. I really appreciate it, brother. You're very welcome, Tyler. Okay. - Did he kick you out? - No! - No, no, no. - Nothing like that. Yeah, like he said, no, no. Would you like a ride home? Uh, no. No, I'm fine, I'm... - Are you sure? - Yeah, I probably need to walk it off. What's up? Yo! - Shit, son. - What are you doing? What are you doing, dude? Ty? Yo, what are you doing out here? I just couldn't sleep, John, I just needed some space. I was just trying to get some sleep, so... - What are you talking about? - I walked down to... to Silvia's... Who the fuck is Silvia? Who's Silvia? Ty? What's going on? Why do you have your shit? I pretended to be asleep. I don't know. Like... I don't know why I would pretend to be asleep... I really don't know. Is that what you're upset about? - Are you scared? - I'm not really sure. I fucking knew you weren't sleeping! I don't know what's going on. All right, yo, yo, yo! Okay. Are you okay? I'm fucking drunk. All right, here, come on, come to the car. It's all right. It's just not smart to do this when you're drunk, you know? Come on. All right, here we go. You good? Yeah. Yeah, we're good. Glad we fucking found you, man! I was fucking scared! Enough, dude. We knew you were out here calling, man, don't worry. A little walk, huh? Yeah, just looking for service. Hey, they're back! There he is. You guys all right? You good? Hey, motherfucker, I didn't say you could keep my coat! This one's not warm at all. He's just a little drunk. He was around the corner... Ty, I want my coat back, baby, I don't care if you're cranky. Ohh. No, no. You okay, Ty? - I think he's really upset. - Over what? Mad at what? I don't know. Johnny said he was drunk when they found him down the road. On foot? Put your shit down, take your jacket off, get some rest. I'll come check in on you, I'll make you breakfast, I'll do whatever you need me to do. - All right? - All right. - Thanks, John. - No worries, my man. I'm going to lock this shit. You look sleepy! What, you just woke up? You wanna say hello to Cosmo, huh? Oh! Don't worry about it, man. I got it. I gotta... I'm going to go, I'm going to say goodbye to my friends, okay? I'm going to say goodbye to my friends and then I'm gonna call you back, all right? Hey, Cosmo, come here! Okay, Cosmo, come here, boy! Come here! Now, tell Mom to answer the phone, okay? Please, yes, yes, okay, I love you more than ketchup. Charles, please, sit down. Take your backpack off. - Please, come on. - Don't have time, - Roddy, don't have time. - Eli! Take some time. - Can I sit down? - Please sit down. Eat. You need food. - I need food? - You. - Move, Cosmo. - So what's the deal? You gotta return the car or some shit? - We gotta get outta here, man. - Move that butt. Move that butt, dog. Where'd you rent it from this time? Oh, come on! I was Instagramming that, man. I know, but we got to go. But if I didn't Instagram it, then the whole weekend never happened, right? Hey! What's up with the hot water? - We're out! - What's this? I'm never coming back! - Gonna recycle it. - Oh, yeah. Compost, compost. - I like it. - Yo! - Yo, yo! - Oh, shit! How you feelin'? - Pretty shit. - Yeah. Do you wanna hair of the dog, or beer or anything? Just to balance you out? No, no, man, I need... Like, you got an Advil, or? I'm sure Nico has... Yeah, he's got something in the house, for sure. - Just ask him, it'll be cool. - All right, yo. - How'd you sleep? - Good. - Good. Can't complain. - How you feeling this morning? I'm good. Thank you. I told y'all, do the other half, you don't have to do that now. Nico, you got any, like... headache medicine, like Advil, Aleve? I don't know, man. Let me check. All right. Thank you. - Hey, Nico, where's... - It smells amazing! We got it, don't worry, we'll talk care of it. You did enough, Nico. Just don't let it go down your throat. Where's my fur, bitch? I like you in that do-rag, man. I used to have one of those things, you know? In high school? This kid Justin in my class had one, I was like "I'll give you 20 bucks right now, I want that." I wore that thing for like a year, I miss it, man. You can have this one for 20 bucks! - Yeah. - Give me that shit. - For real. - I'll keep that - and you'll keep the fur. - Yeah! Yeah, I'm down for that. Okay, one of us is getting a good deal here. You're just selling shit? - All right! - Fuck it! Hey, Tyler, if you want this back, for real, we gotta meet up in the city. - For sure - I'm kidnapping it until then. - Okay. - Or you just buy another one. Yo. Time out. Has anyone seen this, by the way? Does anyone think this is normal, is it appropriate? Look at him. Look at that. I'm gonna call you Kinder Bueno. - So, growing up in eight-Mile... - Kinder Bueno? ...did you know Marshall Mathers or... All right, all right, I love you beautiful fuckers, - but it is time to go. - You guys going? - You guys leaving now? - Yeah, we gotta go. We need to get one picture, one picture! Hey, Ty, give that to Nico. Nico, take the picture, baby. No, no, no, Nico, get in, get in. - I'll take it. - No, no, no, Tyler, fuck you, you get in the picture! - Come on, guys, get in. - Yeah, fuck you! Turn this shit around and hold it up. - All right.
