LOGAN: yöu know, the smallest thing can change yöur life. In the blink of an eye, something happens by chance, when yöu least expect it... ...sets yöu on a course that yöu never planned... ...into a future yöu never imagined. Where will it take yöu? That's the journey of our lives. Our search for the light. But sometimes... ...finding the light means yöu must pass through the deepest darkness. At least, that's how it was for me. [DOG BARKING AND HELICOPTER WHIRRING] [WHISPERING] Security team's ready to go. [WHISPERING] Move them. Ready? Move. [IN NORMAL VOICE] Ready? Go. [SOLDIERS SHOUTING] Don't move! SOLDIER 1: Three civilians! LOGAN: Check them! [MEN SHOUTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] LOGAN: Woman and child! SOLDIER 2: Stay left! Coming through! [SHOUTING CONTINUES] Three children, three children! SOLDIER 3: I'm chasing one to my left! VICTOR: Go. [BOTH PANTING] VICTOR: Shit. SOLDIER 4: Over here. - Castro! CASTRO: Right here. Bumping heads with third platoon. Get on the horn. CASTRO: I'm on it, Aces. - "Aces"? yöu guys came... [GUNFIRE AND SOLDIERS SHOUTING] I got a man down. Need Doc Sanders. First floor corridor. Secure the hallway! Move! Move, move, move! Talk to me, Castro. It's Aces. We're gonna get yöu out of here. [GRUNTING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER RADIO] [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] Roger. About 20 mikes. Helo is inbound. [LOGAN GRUNTS] Let's move out. VICTOR: Now just sit. [VICTOR TALKING INDISTINCTLY] Mortar. Right where yöu were sitting. Three other guys didn't make it. The corpsman found this in yöur SAW pouch. I saw yöu pick it up. Looks like it saved yöu. Got yöurself a guardian angel. She's not mine. [MAYFIELD PERFORMING "WASTED GENERATION"] [CROWD CHEERING] - Do yöu know whose picture that is? - No idea. - yöu know whose picture this is? - No. - No. Sorry. - No? No, I don't think so. We're the wasted generation I'm telling yöu, man, yöu gotta set eyes on that girl one day. yöu got to thank her. No question. She's the reason yöu're still breathing. Give her a kiss for me too. I'm only alive because I followed yöur crazy ass. LOGAN: We just got a couple breaks is all, man. No big deal. Bullshit. Things like this don't just happen. She's got yöu out of this mess. We're going home. God, yöu're full of shit, Victor. I say yöu owe her. Big time. [EXPLOSION] [GUNFIRE ON VIDEO GAME] BOY: yöu're doing good. Now look at my shot. [BARKING] LOGAN: Zeus! Buddy, hey. Come here. How yöu doing? Hi. How yöu doing? Hey, buddy. They look after yöu? [WHISPERING] Go on, ask her. [IN NORMAL VOICE] So, Mom, when do I get my room back? Honey, let's make Uncle Logan feel welcome. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON VIDEO GAME] [GUNFIRE & EXPLOSION ON TV] BOYS: Mom. SISTER: Go outside and play. - Come on, we were just about to win. - Go outside now. - Yes, ma'am. - Oh, fine. SISTER: Are yöu okay? - Yeah. [WHISPERING] He's gonna make it on yöuTube. Time to wake up! [BOTH GRUNT] Mom! Mom! [TIM WHIMPERING] Hey, sorry. Tim. Sorry. yöu know, the Corps can get yöu some help. [SIGHS] LOGAN: Why did I make it out when so many guys didn't? But I feel like there's this debt that I have to pay. I don't know where I belong. I guess I should figure that out. Um... I know there's no easy answer, sis... ...but maybe all I need is time. LOGAN: Any chance yöu recognize that girl? No, I'm sorry. Not in the boat region. Good luck. Thank yöu. [MAN SINGING OVER SPEAKERS] BARTENDER: Hey, Roger? Guy wants to know who this girl is. ROGER: Beth Green. Runs the pet motel just outside of town there. - Do yöu know her? - Ha-ha. Girl can't look like that in a town like this and not be known. Used to be married to a buddy of mine. What's it to yöu, anyway? Oh, I just owe her thanks is all. LOGAN: Hello? WOMAN: Hello. Can I help yöu? What a beautiful Shepherd. What's his name? Zeus. - Oh, he's a sweetheart. - He's good with people. Well, better than I am. BETH: Well, at least yöu don't introduce yöurself to the animals before their owners. - I'm Beth. - Logan. Um... So I, uh, came here... [CELL PHONE RINGS] Excuse me for a second. Hello? Oh, hi, Mrs. Jackson. Come on. I was just about to call yöu to confirm... ...that Selby is coming in today at 2 and he's gonna be with us for a week. [PHONE RINGING] Great. Excellent. No. No, Kevin doesn't work here anymore. Okay, see yöu then. Bye. It's Beth. Yes, we do train. We're full service. I'm so sorry. Just bring in Napoleon's papers and any dietary restrictions that he might have. - Monday is great. Bye. ELLIE: Oscar, get up here. Well, Zeus is way too well behaved to need training... ...so I'm guessing that yöu're here to board him? No, I'm not going anywhere. I just got off the road yesterday. Where from? Colorado. And what brings yöu to Hamden? It's kind of a long story. Actually, I don't really know where to begin. Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry. That's absolutely none of my business. Um... What can I do for yöu, Logan? I'm really here because I came to see yöu. yöu see, I found this. Oh. It was just... Oh, yöu saw the ad. Of course. Okay. So the job doesn't... It doesn't pay much. Um, mostly yöu'll just be walking... ...feeding, cleaning cages. It's six days a week. Zeus is welcome anytime. And help, Logan. That's the job. We just need some help. ELLIE: Oscar. Get up here. Up. Come on. Can I borrow yöur pen? So besides Zeus, do yöu have any experience with working with dogs? I worked with some bomb dogs. - Oh. So yöu were a cop... - A Marine. yöu know what? yöu don't need to finish filling that out. Just leave me a number where I can reach yöu and I will call and let yöu know. Sounds like yöu're having trouble finding someone for the job. Why does a person drive from Colorado to Louisiana to work in a dog kennel? I couldn't tell yöu. I walked. yöu walked? yöu walked here from Colorado? I like to walk. Would yöu excuse me for a minute, please? yöu are such a stubborn boy. Get up here. Come on. yöu can do this. There's a good... Unh! - Did yöu take yöur medication? - Oh. I'm still pumping on all cylinders. That's all that matters, so... What is it? There's a man here who came to apply for the job and I can't get rid of him. [ROOF CREAKS] He looks harmless. BETH: He walked here from Colorado. - Oh? Tell him yöu hired somebody else or something. Why do I have to tell him? yöu're the one that doesn't want him. Do yöu want to hire a crazy person? Are yöu crazy? I beg yöur pardon, ma'am? My granddaughter thinks yöu might be. No, ma'am. Yeah, well, yöu look like a sharp, capable yöung man. yöu tell me why there's a sharp, capable yöung man wanting a job cleaning cages. [ZEUS BARKS] Because it seems like peaceful work. My last job wasn't. Oh, where were yöu? Wall Street? No, ma'am. I was in the Marine Corps. [DOGS BARKING] Ah. Marine Corps. [ZEUS BARKING] LOGAN: Hey. Down. - Train him yöurself? - Yes, ma'am. Hmm. yöu're a good boy. How'd yöu get him to leave? - I gave him the job. - yöu what? Well, we gotta hire somebody. yöu don't know anything about him. Neither do yöu. MAN: Just needs a little tender loving care. I'll take it. MAN: I got tools and lumber and the like. yöu're welcome to them. LOGAN: Thanks. [CHUCKLES] BETH: Come on. yöu know, yöu don't need to be here until 7:30. I couldn't sleep. Figured I'd get an early start. ELLIE: Well, we had a whale of a storm. That lovely thing came down. That's where we store everything up there. - Teslin. Here's yöur new boss. LOGAN: Hey, boy. Hey, boy. BETH: yöu ready to go? - Who's that? That's just somebody that Nana hired. - Aren't yöu forgetting something? - Oh. BETH: Come on, baby, we don't want to be late. Dad doesn't like it when I practice in the house. BETH: So maybe yöu can practice on the porch. ELLIE: The little one. LOGAN: Hey. How yöu doing? BETH: I put Duckie in yöur backpack for tonight. [DOGS BARKING] [ENGINE SPUTTERING] BETH: What's he doing? Can yöu believe that he got that old thing going? Oh, good Lord. yöu know, I'm substituting for Julie next week. It's only a couple days, but... Why don't yöu go back full-time? It's been almost a year. I know how long it's been. [DOGS BARKING] Do yöu think that he has an off switch? I hope not. Ha-ha-ha. [DOGS BARKING] [CAR APPROACHING] Can I help yöu? The hell yöu doing around here? Is there a problem, officer? There will be, yöu don't answer my questions when I ask them. I work here. [SCOFFS] Put yöur hands on that bench. Ahem. Why? Boy, yöu wanna do this at the station? A soldier boy? "Sergeant Logan Thigh-bolt." It's Thibault. - And I'm a Marine. - Mm-hm. Well, where's everyone at, Thigh-bolt? They're all out. Do yöu want me to give Beth a message? Oh-ho. So it's Beth, is it? yöu just tell Beth I'll see her at 4. [KEITH WHISTLING] [VACUUM WHIRRING] yöu should come. yöu never know, yöu might have fun. yöu've always loved their house. - Save yöur breath. I'm not going. - Why not? ELLIE: yöu know I can't stand Judge Clayton and his fundraising extravaganzas. Mom, check it out. Hey. Oh, that looks great, sweets. yöu look very handsome. [TRUCK DOOR CLOSES] - Hey, Dad. - Ah! Hey, wait. What in the world is this mess here, now, huh? We gotta teach yöu how to tie a proper tie, boy. [KEITH CHUCKLES] Whoo-wee. I love yöu in that dress, huh? Makes me wish I never would have signed those papers. [BETH SQUEALS] Tell me about yöur new boyfriend. BETH: What? - Soldier boy, huh? BETH: Don't ask me about him. I didn't hire him. - He has nothing to do with me. - Okay. Okay. [KEITH CHUCKLES] KEITH: Hey, Mama. Place is looking great. CHARLOTTE: yöu look beautiful. BETH: Thank yöu. Thank yöu so much for coming. Really good to see yöu. Here yöu go. We've got the governor in our camp. I just heard. Benny. Wait a second, where's my grandson? - There he is. - Come here, Benny. How yöu doing, sweetie? He's fighting the good fight for Hamden's future. - Tell yöur mama how we gonna win. BEN: Vote Clayton. All right, and? - The name yöu trust. JUDGE: And yöu know. - The name yöu know. - Yep. - The judge yöu trust, the mayor we need. - Ha, ha, ha. This kid is sharp as a tack. He's gonna do great things. yöu mark my word. - Where did yöu dig up that jacket? - Oh. Oh, come on. It's just a garden party, Daddy. It's not just a garden party. MAN: How yöu doing, judge? - How are yöu? - Good to see y'all. Thank yöu so much. WOMAN: Nice to see yöu. [DOGS BARKING] BETH: Come on, Dexter, go get it. Go. Yeah. Yes. Whoo! Oh. That's it, boy, get it, get it. Pick it up. Come on. Oh! Whoa! [DOG WHIMPERS] [LAUGHING] BETH: That man is so irritating. Every time I turn around he's just... - Uh, uh, uh. - Good morning. ELLIE: Mm. So yöu were saying? LOGAN: We moved around a lot, so I kind of grew up everywhere, and nowhere. ELLIE: Oh, that must have been hard, huh? Changing schools, leaving friends. LOGAN: It was okay. It was all I knew. - Mm. But yöu went to college? Yes, ma'am. Just for a year. What'd yöu study? He didn't study much if it was just for a year. ELLIE: Elizabeth Green. - I liked philosophy. ELLIE: Really? Yeah, I like to read. Give us a quote of yöur favorite philosopher. "Sometimes the questions are complicated and the answers are simple." ELLIE: Hmm. - Don't tell me. Voltaire? It's Voltaire, isn't it? It's Dr. Seuss. [ELLIE CHUCKLES] Thank yöu very much the tea, Mrs. Green. I should get back to work. Will yöu call me "Ellie," for goodness sake? Voltaire. [ELLIE CHUCKLES] BETH: What sound does a tiger make? [ALL GROWLING] "This lazy ladybug didn't know how to fly." I wanna turn the page. yöu can turn the page next. "One day the lazy ladybug wanted to sleep somewhere else." Oh, this looks great, yöu guys. Ah. That's beautiful. Julie's not coming back after she has the baby. We'd really like to have yöu back full-time. I can't right now, Rhonda. I'm sorry. A violin? A violin? Only girls play violins. Don't yöu play, like, basketball or something? BOY 1: Oh, fine. The girl wants back his violin. BOY 2: It's his mom. Let's go. Let's go. Hey. yöu okay? [VIOLIN PLAYING] LOGAN: Not bad. BEN: I didn't think anyone was listening. Glad I was. BETH: That's perfect. [DOGS BARKING] LOGAN: Here she is. - Hi. LOGAN: Oh, she's happy to see yöu. WOMAN: How'd she do? LOGAN: She was great. - Make sure yöu bring her back soon. Cool. WOMAN: Thank yöu. ELLIE: Logan. Can yöu drive? Beth's out with a friend and my ride to choir practice just fell through. My bossy granddaughter won't let me drive since I... Well, yöu can hardly even call it a stroke. It's more like a tap, really. Heh. - Hasn't slowed me down in the slightest. - I can see that, ma'am. - How old are yöu, dear? - Twenty-five. How many tours? Three. My grandson never finished his second. Yeah. yöu would've liked him. yöu two, yöu were cut of the same cloth. yöu know, yöu live long enough, Logan, yöu lose enough people... ...yöu learn to appreciate the memories yöu have. Stop begrudging the ones yöu never got to make. Beth hasn't lived as long as I have. She isn't as bad as she seems. She doesn't seem so bad to me. LOGAN: Hello? [DOOR CLOSES] [PIANO PLAYING] [PIANO CONTINUES PLAYING] BETH: All right, thank yöu. I'll see yöu later. [DOGS BARKING] [TERRANCE SIMIEN'S "UNCLE BUD" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] BETH: Yeah. Whoo! Yes.

Do yöu? I can't remember the last time I had a plan. All right, man. yöu got dance moves? - Yeah. - Yeah? Yeah, what yöu got? Whoo-hoo. [BEN LAUGHS THEN WHOOPS] BEN: Mom ran track. She was super-fast. BETH: Cross-country, I wasn't that good. Is that why yöu got a scholarship to Tulane? Because yöu weren't any good? Okay. Once upon a time I was pretty good. Are yöu happy? LOGAN: yöu went to Tulane? No, State to be close to home. Had some personal stuff come up. She got pregnant. With me. BETH: Well, thank yöu, Benjamin. Isn't it yöur night for the dishes? Thank yöu. LOGAN: Do yöu still run competitively? Oh, no, no, no. Now I just do it to clear my head. It's a lot cheaper than therapy, so... So is walking. - Who plays chess? - Me. Me too. Bet I can beat yöu. - What's the bet? - Dishes tonight. Dishes tonight, against the pooper scooper tomorrow. Gotta warn yöu, I'm not bad. Check. [IMITATES ENGINE REVVING] Let's do a flip. Oh, that was cool. Wheelie. Somersault. Checkmate. Detergent is under the sink. LOGAN: What? Did I just get hustled? Have to admit, I played better the second time. BEN: Sure. Until yöur second move. yöu have any other secret talents I should know about? yöu're the one with the secret. I saw him playing the piano. Really? Yeah. I saw it when I put the keys back. He's really good. Hey, yöu're not too bad yöurself. - Why don't yöu play something for us? - How about a magic trick instead? Yeah, okay. He hates playing for people. He doesn't think that he's good enough. Hmm. Ordinary deck. Wow, okay, cool. - Oh. It's all right. - Ha-ha. Show me again. - Tell me when to stop. - Stop. Memorize the card, and I am not looking. Okay, I got it. Let me give it a little magic. LOGAN: Wow. - I didn't know yöu were a magician too. - Wait till yöu see this one. Ben, sweetie, it's past yöur bedtime. - Wait, this is the best one. - Show me tomorrow. Ben, say good night to Logan, now. - Come on. - No. I just wanted to show him a trick. I'm sorry. He's not usually... It's fine. It's fine. My brother taught him a few tricks. Magic was kind of their thing. We lost him last year. He was a Marine too. It's been hard on Ben. It's been hard on all of us. [DOGS BARKING] [GROUP SINGING IN DISTANCE] ELLIE: Thank yöu. GROUP & ELLIE [SINGING]: We share [SINGING INDISTINCTLY] Well, I'm glad yöu came. ELLIE: Oh! - Ho-ho. Whoo! Ha-ha. BETH: Oh... Aren't yöu helpful, dear, and chivalrous? yöu are so...? Isn't he chivalrous? Have yöu been drinking? I had a little something called a Moscow Mule. It sounds terrible, but it was so good. - I'll make yöu a cup of tea. - Oh, good. Okay. Look, there's something that I've been meaning to tell yöu. I never fully explained how... And I'm sorry, I can't find the right words. It's all right. Another time, maybe. After all, I'm not going anywhere. Okay. Good night, Logan. [DOOR CLOSES] [GRUNTS] [GASPING] [BETH GRUNTS] [DOGS BARKING] No. No! Jesus! No! [SOBS] LOGAN: Beth! Beth! No! Stop it! [SOBBING] No. LOGAN: It's okay. It's okay. BETH: At first they wouldn't tell us anything. Just that friendly fire was a possibility. So it's a year ago today... ...and the official investigation into the death of Sergeant... ...Drake... ...Green... ...is still ongoing. That's the worst part. Not knowing. I would give anything... I would give anything to know that he didn't die for nothing. We were inseparable as kids, yöu know? We did everything together. We even built that wall together. Well, Drake built the wall... ...and I supervised... ...which consisted mostly of drinking iced teas and reading the Brontës. [LAUGHS] Oh. This one day... ...I couldn't find my book anywhere. So I asked him about it. And he just pointed. Look. Look. God, I was so mad. I was so mad at him. And he just laughed. [LAUGHING] It was... [SOBS] BETH: I'm sorry. LOGAN: It's okay. yöu got a great laugh, yöu know that? I wish I could hear it more. Why don't yöu try telling me a joke? Because yöu're gonna have to get a few beers in me before I start telling yöu jokes. Okay. - Okay. - Okay. "...Except for Ron and Hermione's slow, deep breathing. Harry glanced over at the dark shapes they made on the floor beside him. Ron had had a fit of..." Mom. - Mom. - Yes. "On the sofa. Hermione's..." "...So that her silotee..." Silhouette. Come on, Brutus. Hi, buddy. [BRUTUS WHIMPERING] All right. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. Ha-ha. Oh, come on. What...? [LAUGHS] Shake. [GRUNTING] Wa-yaah! What's the black dog tag for? This one's mine, and the black one is in memory of my best buddy, Victor. So they're like friendship bracelets. Yeah. Yeah, yöu could say that. No... Oh, man, he's toast. - yöur turn. - Don't. No. LOGAN: Where yöu going? Hey. yöu can run, man, I'm gonna make a Marine out of yöu. [BOTH LAUGHING] [DOGS BARKING] [LAUGHS] [INDISTINCT DIALOGUE] [HORN HONKING] LOGAN: Get over. Go through. Up! See. I've been working on my pop-ups all week. KEITH: All right. That's my boy. BETH: There yöu go. Get in the car. LOGAN: See. - How's old Thigh-Bolt working out for yöu? - Do me a favor, okay? Try and remember this is a charity game. What the hell's that supposed to mean? Don't push him too hard, okay? Hey, yöu know what? When Benny's on yöur time, yöu guys do what yöu want. yöu can plant yöur flowers, yöu can do yöur crochet, play the fiddle, whatever. When he's with me we do it my way. - Have fun, sweetie. Seat belt. - Bye, Mom. - Need to give the kid some room to breathe. [WHISPERS] I'm okay. [DOGS BARKING] No. Cooper. Cooper, stop. [BAND PLAYING "DANCE EVERYDAY"] That's $9. Thank yöu. BETH: I'm gonna get going. I'll be back later to help yöu pack up. [DOGS BARKING] Hey. What's up? KEITH: Unh. There yöu go. BETH: Oh. - What happened? BEN: We won! Oh, he took his eye off a ground ball. It's not as bad as it looks. He just got a little nosebleed. I still stopped it. Got my glove down, kept my body in front. Only one run scored. Ha, ha. It was the play of the game. Tell yöu what, might make a man out of him yet. Why don't yöu go on inside? Take a shower. I'll be right there. - See yöu later, buddy. BEN: Bye, Dad. What? It was an accident. yöu really don't see it. See what? That boy would run through a brick wall for yöu. What does that gotta do with him not being able to field a ground ball? - Huh? - Okay. Don't worry about it. Please go home, Keith. Hey, wait a second. Hey. Who do yöu think yöu're talking to, huh? Keith, calm down. yöu calm down. Let me tell yöu something. That's my son in there too, and I can take that boy anytime I want. yöu got that? Let go of my arm. Let go of my arm. - What's the matter? LOGAN: yöu should do as she says. Let go of her arm. BETH: God! [DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES] [DOGS BARKING] Gosh, I hope that this heals up before yöur birthday. yöur friends' parents are going to think that I beat yöu. I don't have to have a party. Dad says I'm kind of getting old for them. That is ridiculous. Of course yöu're gonna have a party. yöu only turn 8 once. yöu only turn every age once. Shower. Now. [SHOWER RUNNING] [KNOCK ON DOOR] BETH: Thank yöu for that. He can't really take Ben away from yöu, can he? yöu haven't met Keith's father. Why don't yöu just leave? If I tried to take Ben out of Hamden, I could lose him altogether. LOGAN: It's none of my business, but how did yöu end up...? I mean, what... What possessed me to marry him? Picture this: Senior year, he was captain of the football team. I thought that I was in love. Then I got pregnant. He asked, I said yes. Only thing is, he didn't quite realize I expected him to stop dating. I don't want to go anywhere else. This is our home. Has been forever. Whatever else Keith may be, he'll always be Ben's dad. I just want to make sure yöu're okay. Thank yöu. See yöu in the morning. Come on, buddy. Come on. Hey! When are we gonna get those beers? I won't forget. BETH: It's just a casual beer between coworkers. Mm-hm. It's not a date. Oh. Did I say anything? [BEN MIMICS PLANE FLYING] - Do yöu think life has a plan for yöu? - Oh, jeez. Do yöu? If it does, it hasn't shared it with me. Why did yöu enlist? It was the family business. Oh, I had yöu figured for a military brat. yöur father was a Marine? And his dad before him. So yöu signed up for them? The first tour was for them. The second and third were for the guys that were still out there. What time do yöu think it is? Am I boring yöu? I want to show yöu something. Come on. We have to go now. BETH: This is where I come when I want to be alone. LOGAN: She's a beauty. BETH: Dad grew up around boats. He was a vet, but he loved to fish. Mom was a music teacher. She couldn't stand it. LOGAN: yöu've never mentioned yöur parents before. BETH: They died in a car accident when we were very yöung. LOGAN: Sorry, I was just... - It's a fair question. I guess that's why Drake and I were so close. We were so lucky to have Nana. Dad took Drake fishing all the time. When he taught him how to steer this thing, he couldn't have been more than 6 or 7. - What about yöu? - Oh. I love this boat. I know she doesn't look like much now, but she could really fly. - Well, we should take her out sometime. - Oh. Can't even get her started now. LOGAN: That's too bad. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [BETH LAUGHING] Are yöu sure yöu're okay to drive? I'm perfectly sober, thank yöu very much. Hold on. [LOGAN SIGHS] [LOGAN CLEARS THROAT] yöu do realize we're gonna have to do this all again? yöu never told me that joke. Is there any way I can make it up to yöu? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's been so long. - God. - It's all right. yöu should be kissed every day, every hour, every minute. Keith? Oh, Danny. What the hell do yöu think yöu're doing? Put that down. yöu know y'all were doing 50 through town? Oh, like hell we were. Keith put yöu up to this, didn't he? - Didn't he? - Beth, yöu need to go home. - Oh. - Let's just say it never happened. BETH: No. - Sorry. BETH: No, it's me that's sorry. [DOGS BARKING] [SIGHS] [GASPS] Well, that's as clean as it'll ever be. [POT BANGS] [SQUEALS] [MAYFIELD'S "WASTED GENERATION" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] [GRUNTS] Please go. [LIGHT BUZZING] [MUSIC STOPS] Oh, shit. [CLOCK CHIMING] [KNOCK ON DOOR] LOGAN: Ben. [DOGS BARKING] yöu know, yöu should read this when I'm done. I think it could really help yöu. Who says I need any help? My undefeated record. Oh, is that so? - Guess yöu're looking for Mom. - What makes yöu think that? She's in the barn. Ben? Light. What are yöu...? I just wanted to stop by and make sure yöu're okay. yöu just wanted to stop by? - How mysterious. - Okay. I wanted to see yöu. [BETH MOANS] BEN: Mom. What is it, sweetie? The ice cream is melting. Can I just eat it? Just put it in a bowl first. BEN: Okay. [BOTH PANTING AND MOANING] Feel like some ice cream? [DOGS BARKING] LOGAN: Come on. Yeah. Let's see what yöu got.

Oh, don't be shy. yöu know yöu want to. "I told yöu so." There. Feel better? So yöu were right. Only thing is, it's not gonna work out. No guy could ever be this good. They never are. Eventually, it will end. Things will get awkward. He'll quit, Ben will be heartbroken, it will be my fault. Yeah. And he'll grow up hating yöu. He'll move far away, he'll never call. I'll be dead and yöu'll be alone. Forever. [CHUCKLES] BEN: Pick a card, any card. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] BEN: Tell me when to stop. Stop. BETH: I know. Just the turkey things, right on the counter next to the fridge, I think. Impressive trick. I'm gonna grab this from yöu. Oh! Excuse me. KEITH: What the hell's he doing here? Ben invited him. It's his party. [BANGS BOTTLE ON TABLE] yöu think I don't know what's going on around here? Hmm? I don't think I like yöu seeing him. Well, yöu don't have a say in it. I certainly have a say in who my son sees. Hmm? And if I was to say that his mom's unhealthy relationship... ...with some crazy drifter... ...was creating an unstable environment for my boy... ...I don't think there's a judge in the world who'd disagree with me. Certainly not in this town. [INHALES DEEPLY] [EXHALES] [KEITH GRUNTS] [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR SLAMS] [GASPING] He wants yöu out of my life. I can't risk losing Ben. I'm sorry, Beth. I didn't come here to make things harder for yöu. yöu don't know what I'm dealing with. I do know that yöu deserve better than this. [KEITH WHISTLING] How yöu doing? yöu want a ride? What do yöu want? I wanna get yöu a job. yöu gotta be tired of cleaning up dog shit by now. Ha-ha-ha. I know some people. I could make a couple calls... ...and get yöu something worthy of a veteran. What do yöu think? yöu don't know who yöu're dealing with. I know exactly who I'm dealing with. I've known guys like yöu my whole life. yöu think a gun and a badge and a name make yöu something. - yöu better watch yöur mouth. - I'm done talking to yöu. [CLOCK CHIMING] ELLIE: So are yöu planning to let him bully yöu all yöur life? BETH: Excuse me? yöu heard me. yöu know, sacrificing everything in life for our children is... It's not selfless. It's... Well, it's ridiculous. I am doing the best that I can. Really? [SCRAPING] [GRUNTS] BEN: Ooh. The power of earth. [BEN IMITATES GUNFIRE & EXPLOSION NOISES] KEITH: Hey. BEN: yöu need some help? Yeah. Grab that rag and start at the back. I'll meet yöu in the middle. Hey. We're gonna have some pizza tonight if yöu wanna stay for dinner. yöu know what, Keith? That's not gonna work anymore. I figured it out. yöu don't want full custody any more than I want yöu to have it. yöu can try and take him, but I will fight yöu. I will fight yöu and yöur family's lawyers. - Okay, calm down. - I am a damn good mother. Okay, just... yöu know that. Everybody knows that. yöu wanna go back to court, yöu just tell me when. Otherwise, yöu stay the hell out of my life. [TIRES SQUEALING] [DOOR CREAKS] [LAUGHS] BETH: Why did yöu come here? To find yöu. LOGAN: Aah. Come on. [LOGAN YELLING INDISTINCTLY] [BEN LAUGHING] Oh, shit. Damn Mary Carlson fell and broke her wrist, bless her heart. Fifty cents to the swear jar, Nana. ELLIE: Who's gonna play for the choir now? - Probably sound better without her. - yöu could do it. - I could. - Could yöu? - Maybe. - Maybe? It's only a few hymns. - I'm gonna need yöur help. - No way. I can't do it alone, though. I said I don't wanna do it. [DOGS BARKING] [BRIDGE CREAKING] - Hey, can I join yöu? - Sure. What if I screw up? That's the best part about performing in a church. Forgiving audience. Right? I can't get up there alone. I need yöu to be the guy next to me. What do yöu mean? It's how Marines work. We watch each other's backs. yöu don't worry about yöurself. yöu think about the guy next to yöu. All right? All right. [MIMICS COCKING GUN] LOGAN: How many moves do I have left? BEN: yöu're done. [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] Let's move. Come on. Hey, hey. Give it. Come on, come on. Hey. CHOIR [SINGING]: And o'er Jesus, Jesus Precious Jesus Oh, for grace To trust Him more And now, we'll have a special musical offering. - He's so scared. BOY: He can't play that. [PIANO PLAYING HYMN] [VIOLIN & PIANO PLAYING HYMN] [PLAYS OFF-KEY] [CONTINUES PLAYING] [WHISPERS] He can play. JUDGE: yöu know, I had no idea he could play like that. I'm gonna have him play my victory song come November. - He'll be ready. - Thank yöu. I was wondering if yöu've found anybody to take over for Julie's class next semester. I don't know. Have I? BETH: I'll call yöu tomorrow. - Keith. Hey, Keith. - Hmm? Remember I told yöu about that guy showing Beth's picture around? - Yeah, so? - Yeah, so, that's the guy. BEN: I wanna run home with Zeus. [DOGS BARKING] What's up? [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [DOGS BARKING] - What do yöu want now, Keith? - I gotta talk to yöu. It's Sunday night. Can't this wait? No, Beth. Look, this is just strictly police business. Come on, Keith. Where did yöu get that? yöur boy Logan had it. I take it yöu didn't give it to him. This was Drake's. [KEITH SIGHS] He didn't wander into town by chance, Beth. He came here to find yöu. When he first got here, he was asking all around about yöu... ...showing that picture to everybody. yöu know what they said about friendly fire... No. I'm not accusing anyone. I'm just saying that a guy like that... No friends, no people, just shows up here with something so personal? I mean, now, that just don't smell right to me. I've seen stalkers, I've seen how they think. And once they fixate on somebody... ...they're capable of anything. [DOG BARKING] [KNOCK ON DOOR] - Where did yöu get this? - I found it. This was Drake's. He took it everywhere with him. He told me. LOGAN: Listen to me. BETH: No, yöu listen to me. [VOICE BREAKING] yöu didn't come here by accident. yöu came here to find me. I know I should have told yöu. I tried. I didn't know how. Try telling me now. [VOICES WHISPERING IN LOGAN'S MIND] [SIGHS] LOGAN: Move! Move, move, move! [SOLDIERS YELLING] It was in the morning... ...after a night raid. I just found it. In the middle of nowhere. I tried to find out who lost it. I never stopped trying, but nobody claimed it. Finding something like that... ...in a war... ...was like finding an angel in hell. So I kept it with me. Then I survived a lot of things. Things that I had no right to. I promised myself that if I made it out... ...I would find that girl... ...and thank her... ...for saving my life... ...when others weren't so lucky. But I couldn't find the words. How do yöu explain something that yöu can't even understand yöurself? Understand this: This was Drake's. It was meant to keep him alive. I wish it had. yöu should go. Now. BEN: Logan, wait. [DOGS BARKING] Oh, man. yöu sure? yöu need it more than I do. Take care of yöur mom, all right? BEN: I thought I was the guy next to yöu. LOGAN: yöu're my best buddy. I'll always be next to yöu. Tell Zeus I said bye. [ENGINE REVVING] - Here yöu go. - yöu're welcome. [OVER SPEAKERS] That's when yöu know KEITH: I tried to warn her. I tried to tell her he was no good. She didn't wanna listen to me. - About ready here, bud? KEITH: Mm. That's when yöu know Let's do it. MOORE: yöu ain't driving nowhere. KEITH: Oh. - And here's yöur change. KEITH: Yep. - Get yöur coat. - All right. Appreciate it, J.D. BARTENDER: Hey, no problem, man. - Thank yöu. KEITH: Whoo. [CHATTER OVER RADIO] Hey, hang on, man. Stop the car. - I think yöu need to let it go... - Hey, stop the goddamn car! MOORE: He ain't worth it. Shit. Hey. Hey, soldier boy. Don't yöu walk away from me when I talk to yöu. [ZEUS BARKING] Mm. MOORE: Keith, come on. yöu ain't got nothing to say for yöurself? [ZEUS BARKING] LOGAN: Zeus! - Jesus. - Easy, boy. Easy. MOORE: Stand back. Stand back. Man, easy. MAN: Are yöu crazy? - Easy. MOORE: Come on, Keith. Put it down. - Shut up. Ah! MOORE: Hey. Hang on, bud. Hang on. yöu're not a bad guy, Keith. Zeus. Okay, folks. Let's go, let's move along. Everything's fine. [THUNDER RUMBLING] Could have killed him. I talked to Sheriff Grey. He gonna look the other way. Now, come on, Keith. Hey. yöu pull yöurself together now, all right? Gonna be fine. Yep. It'll all blow over by the time the election rolls around. [DOGS BARKING] yöu're not the only one whose life got better when he came here. yöu might not believe it, but I think he was meant to find that photo. Right. Right. Of course. It was all part of a plan. None of us are in control of anything that happens. It's all down to fate. Well, yöu call it what yöu like, but I think it happened for a reason. [VOICE BREAKING] So yöu're saying... ...Drake died so that Logan could live? No. Honey. Oh, sweetheart. It's not Logan's fault that he survived. CASTRO: I'm on it, Aces. LOGAN: "Aces"? [GUNFIRE] LOGAN: Zeus, stay here. I'll be right back. [DOG BARKING] Keith? What are yöu doing? [DOOR CLOSES] [SIGHS] KEITH: I always loved these plates. What do yöu want, Keith? What do I want? I want... I just want us to be a family again. Please. Can we be a family again? I can change. I have, I've changed. I can make yöu happy, Beth. I can. I can make yöu happy again. Keith... I know yöu care about Ben... ...but it's not gonna happen for us. yöu have to let it go. Let it go. Why should I let it go? [FLOOR CREAKING] [SCOFFS] All right, maybe I should just go on and take Ben, now. Huh? Take him away for good. Can't say I didn't warn yöu. Why don't I just take him right now? Where's he at? Benny. - Ben? Ben. - Ben. BETH: Ben. [THUNDER RUMBLING] Benny! Hey! Come back! - He's heading for the tree house. KEITH: Ben! Come back here! Ben! Ben! Ben! Come back here! Benny! Come here! It's dangerous out there! LOGAN: Beth! ELLIE: Go with her, Logan! LOGAN: Beth! KEITH: Ben! Come on! Just walk back to me! Walk back to me right here! I can't, Dad. It's too shaky. Just wait right there, I'm coming to yöu. Dad, I'm scared. - Aah! Ben! BEN: Aah! Help! Help! Help me, Dad! - Aah! Hang on, Ben! BEN: Help! Help! - I can't... - I'm slipping! - Help! - Help me, Dad! Help! Dad! No! Hold on, Ben! [KEITH SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] Ben! Just stay there! I can't, Dad! Hang on, buddy, I'm coming! - Dad! KEITH: Hang on! - Just hang on, I'm coming! BEN: I can't hold on! [GRUNTING] KEITH: I got yöu. I got yöu. - I need yöu to let go and grab onto me. - I can't. I can't. Yeah, yöu can. Now come on. yöu can do it. Ben! Ben! KEITH: Keep yöur arm there. Just hold on tight. BETH: Ben! KEITH: Hold on tight and don't let go. yöu're gonna be all right. Logan! Logan, I need yöur help! Ben! Ben! Here comes Logan. LOGAN: I got yöu. KEITH: Come on. Take him. - My leg's caught. Take him. - I'll come back for yöu. - Dad! KEITH: It's okay. I'm fine. [BEN SCREAMING] [TREE HOUSE CREAKING] - Dad! Dad! LOGAN: Almost there. [GASPING] LOGAN: I'm gonna go back for Keith. No! BEN: Dad! No! [BETH SCREAMING] JUDGE: Here, I don't want any problems down there. So keep this road clear so we can get these vehicles out of here. Bring it. Get back to the bridge, and make sure it's secure, all right? EMT: yöu're all good. JUDGE: Thank yöu. JUDGE: Take him. Okay? Thank yöu for saving Benny. I didn't save him. yöur son did. All right. I'm sorry. [WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY] Did they find my dad yet? [KNOCK ON DOOR] LOGAN: How's Ben doing? - Does he know? - No. Poor Keith. I wish I could have done something more. yöu did a wonderful thing. yöu and Keith did a wonderful thing. I'll go get Beth. Thank yöu. I came back because I found this in the book that Ben gave me. That's yöur brother, Drake, isn't it? Yeah. I know what happened to him. I was there. What do yöu mean that yöu were there? Our platoons crossed paths during the night raid. We were ambushed. There was this sergeant that they called "Aces." One of his men got hit. He didn't think about himself for one second. He just took care of his man. And then I found yöur picture the next morning in the rubble outside. He must have lost it on the way in. I know I've made it hard for yöu to believe the truth. And I'm sorry for a lot of things, but nothing more than that. I just wanted yöu to know... ...he didn't die for nothing. [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] [DOGS BARKING] BETH: Logan, wait. Don't go. [BETH CRIES] yöu belong here. With us. LOGAN: Everyone has their own destiny. Not everyone makes the choice to follow it. And I'm lucky I did. LOGAN: Birthday boy, yöu old enough to steer? BEN: Yeah, I am 9, yöu know. LOGAN: Aye, aye, captain. Take it easy. - Little more left. - That way. That way. [BETH LAUGHS] "Hope You've Liked & Enjoyed The Movie"
