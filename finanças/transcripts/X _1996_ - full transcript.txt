Mother! Mother! Go to Tokyo, Kamui. Your destiny awaits. Mother! Where am I? Where... aml? That‘s... the Earth? Kamui. Two Kamuis? I‘ve come back to Tokyo, Mother. Kamui has returned. Kamui has returned. So it seems. For the ﬁnal battle to decide the fate ofthis planet. Ah, what an impressive shie id. Ofcourse, I‘d expect nothing less from the master ofthe Kimeragi Clan. Wouldn‘t want to endanger innocent bystanders, would we? After all, you‘re the only one iwish to kill. You‘re a ” Dragon ofthe Heavens”. I‘m a ”Dragon ofthe Earth”. It has been preordained that we ﬁght each other to the end. Haah-taah! [Telepathy] Kamui. It’s begun at last-- the ﬁnal battle. I had a dream last night, a dream about Kamui. I haven‘t seen him for six years, so how would I know he looks now, right? But there he was in my dream, all grown up. What‘s more, there were two ofhim. What a strange dream. Areyou listening to me, Fuma? Huh? What was that? What‘s wrong? Is something bothering you? No. It‘s nothing. It‘s late. I‘ll go turn the lights offin the shrine. I‘ll helpyou. It‘s been six years. What? Since Kamui went away. Ready? Not yet! Ready? Not yet! Ready? Ready! Ready! Are you all right? I‘m ﬁne. What is it, Satsuki? Well? is he ”Kamui”? According to my computer, he is the one. Then, it‘s starting at last-- the ﬁnal battle. Kamui? Kamui, it‘s you, isn‘t it? Kamui. [Telepathy] Kamui. How do you know my name? "Kamui " is the name given to the "Promised One. " The one who will determine the fate of the Earth. The fate... ofthe Earth? Please. 5a iie our Earth. Where-- Where is this? This is Tokyo. Tokyo? This city in ruins is Tokyo? What? This is all a dream. Adream? We are now traveling through a dream. We can watch, but we cannot change what happens in a dream. lam Hinoto, the "Dream Watcher. " My dreams forecast the future. Dream Watcher? My role is to tell others about the future lsee in my dreams. Are you trying to tell me that this is the future ofTokyo? You can prevent this from happening. You can sa iie the Earth. Save the Earth? Tokyo... as I know it. What was that? That dragon? You’ve just seen the "Dragons of the Earth. " The Seven Dragons will awal to destroy Tokyo, to destroy the Earth. The only force that can ﬁght the Dragon of the Earth... and sa iie the this planet is the Dragon of the Hea iiens. The Big Dipper? The seven stars of the Big Dipper-- The seven who can create po wer shields to protect the Earth. Do you know the true meaning of your name Kamui? It‘s the name my mother gave me. idon‘t care about its meaning. It means "God’s power. " it is the name given to the one who will act on behalf of God ”God‘s power”? idon‘t know anything about God‘s power. And the future ofthe Earth is none of my concern. Kamui-- I‘ve come back to Tokyo for my own reasons. Not for anyone else‘s. But soon that Tol I don‘t care about Tokyo! There are others that I need to protect! Kamui wait! Please. Save the Earth! Please, Kamui! Fuma! Fuma! -Areyou all right? -Yeah. Princess Hinoto! Are you all right, Princess? Hinoto. Kamui-- So, that boy is Kamui. You‘re... Kamui, aren‘tyou? Yes. Kamui! I‘m so happy to see you! Are you okay? Yes! Welcome back. So, there really is a ” Kamui.” It‘s sort of hard to believe that anyone could hold... the fate ofthe world in his hands. I know. I always thought that ” Kamui” was something more abstract. Like a huge power without a form? [Telepathy] No! He is Kamui Only man can decide the fate ofmanl - My mother... died. - No! Well, now, all seven Dragons of Heavens are here. -There‘s one missing. - Huh? We have lost Subaru, the leader of the Kimeragi Clan. He died ﬁghting a Dragon of the Earth sorcerer. What? Then-- One of the shields to protect Tol< yo has been destroyed Sorata Arisuga wa of the Holy [(0 ya Mountain. Arashi Kishi of the lse Shrine. Yuzuriha Nel the Mitsumine Shrine. Karen Kasumi And S eiichiro A ol Hurry, we must not let the Dragon of the Earth get Kamui! lt’s starting-- The bitter war to decide the future of our planet. Promise? You remember, on the day that you left... you promised us you‘d come here one day to protect Kotori. So I promised that ifyou protected Kotori... I would protect you. You‘ve come back to Tokyo. Now it‘s my turn to keep a promise. I‘ll protect you, Kamui! The end ofthe world is approaching. The end ofthe world? Is there something you wish to protect with your life? Is there someone you want to protect with your life? Kotori and Fuma. Ah. And you, Mother. I‘ll protect you. I promise. Thanks, Kamui. But I‘m going to die soon. It‘s my destiny. Destiny? The preordained future. No! How can the future be decided already? We can determine our own future! No, dear. Only the strong can change their future. Be strong, Kamui. So that you can protect Kotori and Fuma. So that you can protect those you love with your power. Rain? Ouch! Fuma! Take Kotori. My name is Nataku. Is this rain your doing? It‘s mine! You! I‘m Shougo Asagi. Please come with us. I‘ve been ordered to escort you. Yeah? Where to? You‘ll know when you get there. And if i refuse? Kamui! Myjob is to take you back with us. No! ididn‘t think it‘d be easy. Not bad, Kamui. But then, I wasjust warming up. idon‘t want to hurt you... but you leave me no choice. Hey, wait a minute! Two against one? That‘s not fair. Don‘t be mean to Kamui! ifyou like two against one... I bet you‘ll love two against ﬁve! Well. Now we can ﬁght fair and square. Um, I don‘t quite agree. Oh,you‘ll understand when you grow up. No, I‘m a grown up, but I don‘t agree, either. Hey, Sorata. We wouldn‘t want to disturb the nice people ofthe neighborhood. I know, I know. You‘re always thinking one step ahead ofme, babe. " Babe"? Don‘t you think you‘re overdoing it a bit? Sure, the shield will thrust the area inside it into another dimension. And no amount ofdamage which occurs within the shield... will have any effect on the real world. But once its creator dies, the shield loses its power. And all destruction inside the shield suddenly becomes very real! So, you‘ve done your homework. I‘ve seen it happen. The death ofa Dragon ofthe Heavens... and the crumbling ofthe shield! What a cute gimmick he‘s got there. Almost as good as yours, Karen. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Thanks, inuki. Listen, buddy, we‘re here to see Kamui, too. Why don‘t you just go home for today? Oops! Fuma-- Oh! Makeishibaraya! Sowaka! Hah! Sorry about the weather. Fuma. Kotori! Fuma! Kotori! What have you done with Fuma and Kotori? No. You‘ve got it all wrong! Listen. Bring them back! Bring them back! Whoa! You okay? Yeah. I‘ll live. What happened to the guys with their magic tricks? They took off. Probably thought you were too much for them to handle. How smart ofthem! Ouch-- But-- That‘s some power he‘s got. Like the name says, it‘s ”God‘s power.” Wait! We‘ve played no part in the abduction ofyour friends. It is probably the work ofthe Dragon ofthe Earth. Please come with us, Kamui. Come to me, pretty lady. Kamui‘s loved one. You‘re a pretty ﬂower to lure Kamui into my grasp. But how-- how did you come uninvited into my dream? Where is Kotori? Where have you taken her? Did you hear what I said? Where is she? What have you done with her? I‘ve found him, the other Kamui. Kamui‘s twin star. The ”other” to complement Kamui. No matter which dragon Kamui should become... this ”other” will ﬁll his place. Tokyo. This is... Tokyo. But what am I doing here? A minute ago, I was standing in Togakushi Shrine, and now-- This is a dream. Adream? Yes, a dream. It‘s no ordinary dream. This dream shows the future. The future? I am Kanoe, the Dream Watcher. My dreams reﬂect the future. Dream Watcher? My role is to tell others about the future i see in my dreams. We are now traveling through that dream. This is Tokyo ofthe future? Yes. Tokyo is now stagnant and foul. This is how itwill look... in the future, once everything has been cleansed and revived. But why is the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building still standing? Don‘t worry. That dragon is one of us. Why, it may even be you! The Dragon ofthe Earth will destroy all the power shields... in Tokyo and open the gateway to Earth‘s revival. Dragon ofthe Earth? Tokyo‘s power shields are a crucial force holding the world together. There are many shields here. The skyscrapers ofShinjuku form a huge power stone. The rails for the Yamanote train line run in the shape of Buddha‘s hand... to protect the Imperial Palace as well as all ofTokyo. The Sunshine 60 Building serves as a foundation... to support Tokyo‘s insecure ground. And there is Tokyo Tower. Destroy all ofthese shields, and Tokyo will fall. The obscene structures built by man, everything corrupt... and polluted will be annihilated. Nature will be revived, and Earth will return to its original state. The only force that might prevent this from happening is... the Dragon ofthe Heavens! You possess the same power as Kamui. You were born to be Kamui‘s twin star. No matter which dragon Kamui chooses to become... you will join the opposing side to take his place. You are ”The Other.” Kotori! - Kotori! - Fuma. Kamui? Noooo! Nooo! This isjusta dream! It‘s only a dream. Yes. It‘s only a dream. But it‘s also the future. The Earth is dying. ifsomething isn‘t done... to prevent it, the Earth will die, polluted and violated by man... and robbed ofany power to revive itself. Without mass destruction, Earth can no longer revive itself. Please. You can save the Earth! I don‘t have this poweryou say can save the Earth or destroy it. I‘mjust an ordinary high school student. The power is in you. Youjust don‘t realize ityet. Traveling through my dream was more than that girl could endure. Don‘t worry. She‘s now sleeping deep within my dream. Safe from Kamui. Kamui. Yes. Kamui. The name given to the one who will hunt down the forces... that control God‘s power is the Other Kamui. That is you! Please. You mustjoin Dragon ofthe Earth. Destroy Tokyo‘s power shields. That is the only way you can save your little sister. And Kamui, I‘m not going to let him... kill. That‘s foryou to decide. Kamui! [ Telepathy] i have been waiting i cannot talk. i cannot hear and i cannot see. Please excuse my speaking to you through your mind Come. You again. Forgive me if i have angered you b y pulling you into my dream... without any warning Our little Princess here tells the future for... the guys who run this country. The Final Battle has already begun, Kamui Please right with us to save Tol< yo. To save the Earth. I told you! The only reason I‘ve come back to Tokyo is... To protect the girl and her brother who run the Togakushi Shrine. Why do you say that? When we traveled through my dream, i sa w them. The people whom you care for-- - The two you love more than anyone. - No, Kamui! Shut up! - You took Kotori and Fuma? - No. Then, who did? Kanoe, m y younger sister. Your sister? I don‘t understand. Kanoe is m y younger sister. My only l She can travel through dreams, as i can. Kanoe is gathering the forces of the Dragon of the Earth... to destroy this planet. The Dragon ofthe Earth? The one you showed me in your dream? Hold my hand i will sho w you YOUR future. Kotori! Kotori! Are you saying that... I‘m going to kill Kotori? You can change this future by becoming a Dragon of the Heavens. Your dreams are in bad taste. Forlong time, I thought the same wayyou did. The future ofthe Earth was none of my concern. The story was too hard to believe, anyway. ididn‘t understand why i had this power, and I didn‘t want it. I started working in bars and brothels ‘cause there... nobody asks any questions. But I love this city. I really do. And I‘m not going to let anyone destroy it. My wife and daughter love Tokyo, just as Karen does. My wish is for the three of us to lead a simple... but peaceful life in this city. Listen, Kamui. This computer here is called the ” Beast.” Satsuki created it herself. She can break into any network and access... any kind ofinformation she needs. According to Satsuki, the ” Beast” loves her very much. It gets veryjealous when she puts her mind on other things. I guess you can call it a love affair between a computer... and the world‘s greatest cyber-girl. Are you surprised? Nobody would dream that something like this... exists underneath the Tokyo Government Metropolitan Building. How beautiful-- a glass Tokyo. I‘ll prove to you that my prophesy is true. Here. This... will fall. What‘s wrong, Princess Hinoto? Tol< yo S tation-- Tol< yo Station will fall! Let‘s take picture, guys! Take my great shot, Mom. Oh, don‘t worry! Hahahaha... Come on, Kotori. Get in the picture. Cut it out, guys! Say, ”Cheese.” Be strong, Kamui. So that you can protect Kotori and Fuma. So that you can protect those you love with your power. Listen, Kamui, you‘ve got the power. You decide how you‘re going to use it. Well. Shall we go? Yes. Yuzuriha. Yes, Karen? -You wait here. -What? ifanything should happen to us, you go tell the others. I‘ll ﬁght with you! They don‘t need me to report what happens here. Hinoto will know. There are many other shields that need to be protected. Please let us handle this one. Make sure you stay outside my power shield, okay? Hey, hey, hey! Wait up! Wait, I say! Wait for me! H ey! "Karen, please make the powershield " Haa! Ugh! Don‘t get carried away! Arrgh! Karen! Kamui Kamui Kamui Kamui Kamui.. something.. is... inside... me... Kamui. Something.. is gro wing.. inside me. It will... soon be born. Kotori? Ugh! No! Karen ’5! Yes. Where is Aoki? ican‘t ﬁnd him anywhere. That means he‘s moved to another shield. All right! No way! I‘m ﬁghting with you! Uh, oh-- [ Telepathy] Kamui has returned So. Now, you have Kamui Kanoe... you thinkyou‘ve won? Well, it happens that I‘ve found my own Kamui. What? The other Kamui-- the one who was born tojoin the opposing side... no matter which dragon Kamui chose to become-- The Other! Yes, and he‘s one of your Kamui‘s precious friends. It‘s the reason for his return to Tokyo. Sad, isn‘t it... that the two are destined to ﬁght each other to the death. Kanoe, howcouldyou-- How could I? You think I‘m cruel, Hinoto? ididn‘t wish for this. It‘s their destiny that‘s cruel. Stop this, Kanoe! Stop the Dragon of the Earth from destroying the po wer shields! I have the right to wish for the future of my desire. The destruction of the Earth? ls that your desire? The Earth? I don‘t care about the Earth. Kanoe! The battle hasjust begun, Hinoto. Let‘s see whether your Kamui can beat mine. This battle is meaningless! What does the Dragon ofthe Earth hope to achieve? It is not the Earth we wish to destroy. It‘s mankind. Men kill, they hate, they devastate this planet. What, then, is the reason for their existence? What the Earth needs now is tranquility. Maybe you‘re right. But there are people I need to protect! For those people, and for those who died ﬁghting for the Earth... ican‘t let you live! Aoki! How many shields still standing? Code i 095 from the Beast. The area within Sunshine 60 shield has been totally eliminated. The area within a ﬁve-kilometer radius has been destroyed. Code1096!Seiichiro Aoki ofthe Dragon ofthe Heavens is dead. We have lost Nataku in the battle. What a glorious sunrise. I can‘t believe I said that. I am... the other Kamui? Who decided that? What about Kotori? She‘s now making me a-- idon‘t care about the Earth or the fate ofthe world. I‘ve returned to protect those people I love... and I‘ll ﬁght for them! That‘s the best reason I‘ve heard yet, Kamui! Hey, Kamui! Take care onuzuriha, will ya! You don‘t have to worry about me! Nice dog. Good boy. What is it? A Dragon ofthe Earth. Have I got something on my face, kid? Wait! You can see inuki? inuki?Strange name. The only ones who can see inuki are... the people concerned with the end ofthe Earth. Which means? That you must be a Dragon ofthe Earth. A Dragon ofthe Heavens. Tell me. Where is Kotori? Hah! That‘s Yuzuriha‘s shield. It‘s started. Yuzuriha‘sjust what, i 4 years old now? I bet she‘s never even fallen in love. Maybe we should have left her with Hinoto. You‘re going soft. Let‘s lend them a helping hand then. ”A helping hand”? That‘s right. Why, he‘sjust like Kamui. - A Dragon ofthe Earth? - Yes. Strange, though. Whyis he so much like Kamui? Don‘t worry. Whatever happens, I‘ll protect you. I like you, babe. You‘re my type-- a real knockout. I bet you say that to all the girls. That‘s not true! You‘re the one I want to protect. Having someone to protect can make a guy strong. You just watch. Hah! Hah! Hey, Yuto! Are you going to just stand there and watch? Sorry. Your ﬁghting was so impressive... I thought it‘d be a shame to interfere. Cut the crap. This isn‘t a training exercise! Hah! What the-- Someone is controlling the underground cables! Wow. A work of art. Hah! Hahaha. That was close. Caught me looking the wrong way. Hah! Noooo! Hey, buddy! You‘re Kamui‘s friend, aren‘t you? Kamui‘s looking foryou! Kamui-- Kamui... is me! Fuma. Kamui! Yuzuriha! Say good-bye, kid. Ugh! I‘m sorry. I guess I didn‘t do much good, did I? You know, I‘ve never been in love with anyone. iwish I had someone to cry for me when I die. Hey, Kamui Promise me that you’ll protect the ones you love! Fuma!You‘re all right? Leave this to me. Ugh! Fuma? So, you‘ve chosen to become a Dragon ofthe Heavens. I‘m your twin star. ifyou‘re a Dragon ofthe Heavens, then I‘m a Dragon ofthe Earth. I was born to be your counterpart. Fuma. As a Dragon ofthe Earth, I must kill you. It‘s my destiny. Fuma. It‘s destiny, Kamui. [Telepathy] Kamui! Kamui How cruel that you must ﬁght the one you promised.. to protect with your life. Take me to Kotori. Take me... insideyour dream. Fuma? itis time. The sword which can be created only by those who love Kamui deeply-- The ﬁrst sword belongs to Kamui who is the Dragon ofthe Heavens. And... this belongs to Kamui who is... the Dragon ofthe Earth. Kotori. Kotori. Run, Kotori! Kamui! Kotori! This way! Kamui! Kotori! Fuma? Noooo... Kotori! Why? Ugh! Yuto! No! Beast! Help Yuto! Why? You killed Kusanagi, and now you‘re going to kill me? I thought we were on the same side... idon‘t remember taking sides. And I don‘t need your help. Beast, didn‘t you hear me? I said, help Yuto! Are you doing this for Kamui? I am Kamui! Argh! Ugh! "Satsuki is our property " "Nobody is going to take heraway " "Satsuki is our property-- " What‘s going on here? [Telepathy] That boy is the other Kamui One who lives only to kill and destroy One whose only goal is to strike down the Dragon of the Heavens... and annihilate the po wer shields protecting Tol< yo. The Dragon ofthe Earth has fallen. Ugh! Kanoe! Kanoe! H i noto-- Hah! Ugh! Hinoto, you‘ve lived here all your life... telling the future for the men who run the government. You predicted that, with Kamui on your side... Tokyo‘s power shields would be protected. But the Dragon ofthe Earth has risen. The Dragons ofthe Heavens will all be destroyed. Dragon ofthe Heavens, you‘ve got no chance against me. Your prophesy will have proved false, Hinoto... and who wants a Dream Watcher whose dreams don‘t come true? Kanoe, No. You didn’t! Then, you‘ll be free, Hinoto.. to win your freedom, I‘d do anything. Yourfreedom is all I ever wanted. Kanoe, Hah! Arashi! Are you okay? Yes. Why-- Why did you save me? I told you. You‘re my type. From the day i was born, I was destined to die ﬁghting for the Dragon ofthe Heavens. I thought, ifl‘m gonna die, I‘d die protecting a very pretty lady. i wish I could protect you to the very end... but, babe, I can‘t even see your pretty face... a nym ore. You know, I never got around to asking you... how you feel about me-- Sorata! Well, now you can ask her. Kamui.. all the members of the Dragon of the Heavens are dead except you. Fuma‘s killed them? The Kamui of the Earth has no memory of the past. He has no feeling All he has is the urge to kill the Dragon of the Heavens... and to destroy Tol< yo ’5 po wer shields. i will send you to Tol< yo Tower, the ﬁnal shield Please choose the end of your desire... Kanoe, Fuma, don‘t you remember anything? Have you forgotten Kotori? Have you forgotten me? That girl loved Kamui from the heart. inside her, she grew a sword which only Kamui could use. So i pulled it out. It‘s simple as that. Fuma. There is only one member ofthe Dragon ofthe Heavens remaining... Your death will mark the ending. Fuma, I‘ve come back to protect you, not to-- Hah! I didn‘t return to Tokyo to ﬁght you! I am Kamui. Destiny has so decided. From the moment you chose to become a Dragon ofthe Heavens... I was destined to become a Dragon ofthe Earth. You‘re Fuma! You‘re not me! I am Kamui! Man cannot ﬁght his destiny! We were destined for this battle. And in the end, mankind will be destroyed. That has also been preordained. No. We can choose our own destiny. Aaaaaaah! Fuma! Fuma. You are Fuma, aren‘t you? Yeah. You promised us... you’d come back to protect Kotori So i promised you that... if you protected Kotori, i ’d protect you. - Hurry up, Kotori! -Wait for me. Why? Why did this have to happen? Tell me? Fuma!
