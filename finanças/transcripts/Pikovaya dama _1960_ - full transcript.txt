THE QUEEN OF SPADES based on opera by P. Tchaikovsky "The Queen of Spades denotes secret ill-will" The latest Fortune-Teller, A. Pushkin How did the play end yesterday? Needless to say, I lost badly! I have no luck. Did you play all night again? Yes, I was so bored... Devil take it! Can't a man win once in a way? - Was Herman there? - He was. From eight in the evening until eight the next morning, riveted to the gaming table, as always, - Drinking silently. - Is that all? He watched the others play. What a strange man he is! As though he had at least three crimes on his conscience! I am told that he is very poor. He is certainly not rich. Look, there he is. Gloomy as a devil out of hell, so pale . Tell me, Herman, what is wrong with you? With me? Nothing. Are you ill? No, perfectly well. You have changed somehow... Are you puzzled with something? Yes, I no longer feel able to continue My determined course to my goal, I do not know myself what has come over me, I seem to have lost myself. Indignant with my own weakness, I am no longer my own master, I am in love! In love! What? You're in love? With whom? I do not know her name and may never learn it. It is not by the world's name for her That I wish to call her. It beggars all comparison, I do not know its like... My love's a state of heavenly bliss That I must never lose! But the jealous thought that she might be another's, When I dare not even kiss her footprints, tortures me. I curse myself but to calm My earthly passion, And still I long to clasp her then, To clasp the one I worship. To clasp the one I worship. I do not know her name And do not wish to know it! If that is the case, we must get to work! Learn who she is, Make a bold proposal for her hand, and it's done... Oh no, alas! She is of noble birth and can never be mine! That is what riles and gnaws my heart! We will find you another... She is not the only girl in the world. You do not know me! No, I can never forget her! Ah! Tomsky, you do not understand! I could only live peacefully, While my passions slumbered, Then I was master of myself; Now, when I am in the power Of a single dream, farewell, peace of mind! Farewell, peace of mind! I am poisoned, as though I were drunk, I am sick! Sick! I am in love! But are you sure that she's not noticed you? I am prepared to bet That she's in love and pining for you. Without that comforting hope, Do you suppose I could bear my misery? You can see that now I am alive and suffering, But when the terrible moment comes And I realise that she will never be mine, Then I shall have only one thing left... What? Death! May I offer you my congratulations? You're engaged to marry, I hear. Yes, gentlemen, I am marrying. A bright angel has consented To unite her fate With mine for ever. I am delighted to hear it. And I too, from the bottom of my heart. Be happy, Prince! Yeletsky, my congratulations! Thank you, my friends! Tell us, whom are you marrying? Yes, Prince, who is your bride-to-be? There she is! She? She to be his bride? O God! He is here again! So that is your Bella Incognita! Countess, allow me to offer you my congratulations... Tell me, - Who is that officer there? - Which? That one? That is Herman, a friend of mine. Where does he come from? What a fearful-looking man! The bewitching beauty of the day, The spring, the whisper of the light breezes, The gaiety of the throng, My friends' kind wishes - All promise us a long And happy future together! Take heart, my friend, Do not forget that after a calm day comes the storm, And that the Creator mingled tears and happiness, sunshine and storm! What an old witch, that Countess! A scarecrow! Yes, it was not for nothing that she was nicknamed the Queen of Spades! I can't make out why she has given up gaming. What? That old thing? What do you mean? An old hag of eighty! So you do not know her story? - I know nothing! - Nor I! Then listen to me! Many years ago in Paris the Countess was a famous beauty. All the young men were mad about her And she was known as "the Moscow Venus". Count Saint Germain, who was then still a Handsome man, Was one of her admirers, But his sighs for the Countess were unavailing! The beauty spent her whole nights gaming And alas! Preferred Pharaon to love. Once at Versailles at the "Jeu de la Reine" The Moscow Venus had lost her last sou. Count Saint Germain was among the guests; Following her from the tables, he heard her murmur in despair. "O heaven! O heaven! O heaven. I could recoup all my losses If I could only have once morethose three cards, Three cards, three cards"! The Count, choosing cleverly his moment, When, as she left unnoticed the crowded hall, The beauty was sitting silent and alone, Whispered amorously into her ear Words sweeter than the sweetest Mozart: "Countess, Countess! "Countess, in return for a single rendez-vous, I am ready, f you will, to name you Those three cards, three cards, three cards"! The Countess blazed "how dare you?" But the Count was no coward. And when a day later The beauty was seen once again, alas! Without a sou in her pocket at the "Jeu dc la Reine" She already knew the three cards... Playing them boldly, one after the other, She won back her fortune, But at what a price! O cards, cards, cards! Once she told her husband those cards, On another occasion a handsome boy learned them, But on that very night, no sooner was she alone Than an apparition warned her threateningly - "You will receive your death-blow From the third who, impelled by burning passion, Comes to force from you the knowledge Of those three cards, those three dread cards! Three cards!" Se non e ver' e ben trovato. Delightful! but the Countess can sleep quietly; It would not be easy to find her a passionate lover now. Listen, Herman! There's a perfect opportunity for you To gamble without any money! Just think of it! From the third who, impelled by burning passion, Comes to force from you the knowledge Of three cards, three cards, three cards! "You will receive your death-blow from the third Who, impelled by burning passion Comes to force from you the knowledge of Three cards, three cards, three cards!" What use are they to me, Even supposing that I knew them! My life is ruined now... And I stand alone. The storm has no fears for me! In me all the passionsare aroused with such murderous force That this storm is nothing in comparison! No, Prince! While I live I will not surrender her; By what means I do not know, but have her I will! Storm, lightning, wind! I give my solemn oath before you - She shall be mine, mine, Or I will die! Tis evening... The cloudy spaces darken, The last ray, of sunset fades on the towers The stream's last glittering wavelet dies Beneath the darkened sky. The darkened sky. Now you sing, Polya - by yourself! By, myself? But what shall I sing? Oh! please sing, anything you know, Ma ch?re, darling, Do sing us something! I'll sing you a favourite song of Liza's. Wait, How does it go? Yes, that's it... "My darling friends, My darling friends, playful and free from care With dance and song you gambol in the fields! Love, seen in golden dreams, Promised me happiness, But what was tobe my portion in those happy spots? in those happy spots? in those happy spots? A grave, a grave, a grave..." It is time now to break up your party. I was sent to tell you to make your adieux. Liza, why do you look so downcast? Downcast, I? Not at all, Just look what a Beautiful night it is, And how everything seems new and fresh after the storm. Now I warn you, I shall complain about you to the Count And tell him that on your engagement-day You were depressed.... I beg of you, don't do that! That's better. And now, good-bye! That's better. And now, good-bye! I will take you down! What am I crying for, What is it? My girlhood dreams, you have deceived me! My girlhood dreams, you have deceived me! You have deceived me! It is scary, it is hard! Why should I lie? I am alone here, all around me lie sleeping... Oh! Hear me, night! To you alone can I confide the secret of my heart! It is as dark as a dream, Dark as the melancholy look of those eyes That rob me of my happiness and peace of mind... Queen Night! Like you, great beauty, Like a fallen angel He is handsome, In his eyes is the fire of glowing passion. He beckons to me like some wonderful dream And all my soul is in his power! O night . . . night! - Stay, I beg of you! - Why are you here, mad man? What do you want? To say farewell! Do not go! Stay! I myself am going in a moment, Never to return here One moment! What can it cost you? A dying man implores you. Why, why are you here? Go! No! I'll scream! Wait! I am past caring whether I die alone, My life has no value to me! But if, pround beauty, You possess but a spark of compassion, - Then stay and do not go! - Oh! heavens above! My last hour has come, the hour of my death! I learned today my sentence - you are giving your heart to another, cruel one! Let me die with blessings on my tongue for you, Not curses. How can I live a day longer When son belong to Another? I lived for you: A single feeling And a single never flinching thought governed my being! Ms life is finished, but before I bid It a last farewell, let me spend just one moment Alone with you. In the silence of the night and drink a deep draught of your peerless beauty! And with death, peace of mind No, do not move! Oh How lovely you are! You must go! You must go! My beauty, my goddess! Angel of heaven! Forgive me, loveliest of creatures, For disturbing your peace, Forgive me! But do not spurn My passionate confession, Do not spurn it with indifference! Oh! Grant me leave, as I die, to utter a prayer to you: Look down from your heavenly heights Upon the mortal struggle Of a spirit tortured With love for ou, have pity, And warm my heart with kindness, with a compassionate tear! You are weeping? You? What do these tears mean? You do not spurn me, you have pity? I bless you for it! My beauty, my, goddess! Angel of heaven! Liza! Open the door. The Countess ! Merciful heavens! This is the end! Too late! This way! Why are you not asleep? Still dressed? - And what was all that noise? - I was walking up and down my room, grandmamma.. I can't sleep... Why is the balcony-door open? Look at me! No more nonsense, now. Go to bed at once! - At once, do you hear? - Yes, grandmamma, I'm just going. Can't sleep indeed! Did you ever hear such nonsense? What times we live in! Can't sleep', indeed! Go to bed at once! Yes, grandmamma - please don't be angry! All this noise, Disturbing your grandmother! Enough! And don't ou dare to start any more nonsense! "...he who, impelled by burning passion, Comes to force from you the knowledge of Those three cards, those three dread cards!" A tomb like chill breathes in the air! O fearful apparition! Death, I'll have none of you! O spare me! A moment ago death seemed to me Salvation, almost happiness! But now no longer, it is a horror to me You have opened to me a dawn of happiness, I wish to live and die with you! Madman, what do on want from me, What can I do? Decide my fate! Have pity on me, ou are driving me to distraction! Go, I beseech you, I command you! So You pronounce sentence of death upon me? Merciful heaven! My resolution slips... Go, I beseech you! Then say it clearly, - "die!" - O God in Heaven! - Farewell! Wait! Live! Mv beauty, my goddess! Angel of heaven! Together forever! Our Herman once again looks glum. I wager you that he is in love, One moment gloomy and the next merry. No, gentlemen, he is under the spell Of - guess, what! - The hope of discovering those three cards. - He really is an odd fellow! I don't believe it, such a hope implies an ignoramus! Herman is no fool. - I have it from his own mouth. - In fun! Let's go and bait him! All the same he is one of those men Who will stick at nothing Once his mind is made up. Poor devil! poor devil! You are so downcast, my dear, As though you had some grief... Confide in me! No, later, Prince, another time ... I beg you! Wait one moment! I simply must speak to you! I love you, love ou beyond all measure, I cannot conceive a day without you, I am ready to accomplish for our sake A heroic task requiring matchless strength. Yet I see clearly and feel it now How I allowed myself to be misled by my dreams, How little trust you have in me, How alien and How remote I seem to you. Oh! I am tormented by this remoteness, All my soul shares in your suffering, Your sadness is mine. Your tears, I weep them too! Oh! I am tormented by this remoteness. All my soul shares in your suffering! I love you, love ou beyond all measure, I cannot conceive a day without you, I am ready to accomplish for our sake A heroic task requiring matchless strength. My dear, confide in me! "Alter the pertormance wait for me in the hall. I must see you!" The sooner I see her and renounce this idea... Three cards! Learn the three cards and I am a rich man! Then fly with her, away from all these people... Hell and damnation! This idea will drive me mad! Are not you the third who, impelled by Burning passion Comes to learn from her the knowledge of three cards, Three cards, three cards? Three cards, three cards, three cards! What? Am I delirious or are they making fun of me? No! And yet... Mad, I must be mad! "He who is impelled by burning passion..." Well, and am I not in love? Why of course ... I am! Look, your lady-love! Again . . . again I feel afraid! And the same voice Who is it? A demon or a mortal? Why. do they, follow me? Hell and damnation! Oh! what a petty, laughable creature am I! - Herman, listen! - It is you at last! How happy I am that you have come! I love you, I love you! This is no place for such talk... It was not for this that I asked you to come here! Listen! Here is the key to the secret door into The garden ... there you will find the staircase... And by it you go up to my grandmother's bedroom . What? Into her bedroom? She will not be there. In the bedroom by The portrait is the door to my room... I shall be waiting for you! Oh! It is yours and yours alone I would be! We must plan everything! And now farewell until to-morrow, My darling, my beloved! No, not tomorrow, No, tonight I shall be there! - No, darling... - It must be so! So be it then! I am your slave! Farewell. Now not I, but fate decides, And I shall learn the three cards! Yes, everything is just as she said... Well, then? Am I perhaps afraid? No! No, my, mind is made up, And I will learn the old woman's secret! And what if there is no secret? And all this is but the vain delirium of my sick spirit? So, there she stands - la Venus Moseovite! Some secret force Binds our destinies together. Which of us is the victim, you or I? All I know is, one of us Will be the other's doom! I may stare at you and stare in hatred, But mv eyes can never feast their fill! I would escape, but do not have the power... My searching gaze cannot tear itself away From that terrible and fascinating face! No, we can never part without a fateful meeting. Yes! It's all decided! Yes! Then come what may! The light of our eyes, she is, the little lady, And rest she surely must. Lie down, then, and to-morrow once again You will be fairer than the dawn itself! Lie down, then! Rest, rest! Enough of your lying flatteries! I am tired . . . tired out. No, I will not sleep in the bed! Oh! I hate the world to-day! What times we live in! People simply do not know how to enjoy Themselves any more. What manners! What a tone! Better not to watch them... They don't know how to dance or to sing! Who are the dancers to-day? Who sings? A lot of hoydens! But in those days, who were the singers? Le duc d'Orlean, la duc d'Ayen, de Coigni,.. la comtesse d'Estrades, La duchnesse de Brancas... What names! And even, on occasions, The Pompadour herself! I sang too in their company... Le duc de la Valliere praised me! Once, I remember, at the Prince of Cond?'s at Chantilly The king heard me! I can see it all as though it were to-day... Je crains de lui parler la nuit J'ecoute trop tout ce qu'il dit, Il me dit: "je vois fime" Et je sens malgre moi Mon Coeur qui bat. Je ne sais pas porqoui. What are you doing standing there? Go away! Je crains de lui parler la nuit J'ecoute trop tout ce qu'il dit, Il me dit: "je vois fime" Et je sens malgre moi Mon Coeur qui bat. Don't be frightened! For God's sake don't be frightened! I won't hurt you! I have come to ask you for a single favour! You can make the happiness of my whole life! And it will not cost you anything! You know three cards... For whom are you guarding this secret? If you ever knew love's emotion, If you remember the ardours And raptures of young blood, If you smiled even once at a child's caress, If a heart ever beat in your breast, Then I beseech you by the feelings of a wife, A lover, a mother! By everything in life that you hold sacred, Tell me, reveal to me your secret! What benefit is it to you? Perhaps it is linked with some terrible misdeed, With the loss of eternal salvation, With some diabolical pact? Think well, you are old and have not long to live, And I am ready to take your guilt upon me! Confide in me! Speak! You old witch! I will force you to answer then! Enough of these games! Are you willing to name the three cards to me? Yes or no? She's dead! It's all over and I never learned her secret. Dead! Dead! It's all over and I never learned her secret. What is all this noise? You, you, here? Hush! Hush! She is dead. And I never learned her secret! Who is dead? What are you talking about? It's all over! She is dead, ?nd I never learned her secret! Yes! She is dead. O God! And it was you who did it? I did not wish her death, I only wanted to know the three cards! So that is why you are here! Not for me! You wanted to know the three cards! It was not I you needed, but the three cards . . O God, O God! And I loved him and was ready, to ruin Myself for his sake! Monster! Murderer! Hellhound! Go! - Out of my sight! - She's dead! "I do not believe that you intended the Countess' Death. I am tortured by the conscience of my guilt before you! Set my mind at rest! I shall wait for you this evening on the embankment When we shall be seen by no one. If you are not there before midnight, I shall be Forced to admit the terrible thought that I try to drive from my mind. Forgive me, I beg of you, but I am in Such agony of mind!..." Poor creature! Into what an abyss I have dragged you with me! Oh! If I could only forget it all and sleep! Always the same thoughts, The same terrible dream and dark visions of the funeral rise before me as real as life . What is that? Chanting, or the wind's bowling? I cannot make out... Just as there... yes, yes, they are singing! And there are the church, the congregation, The candles and the incense, and the sobbing... There is the bier and the coffin... And in that coffin the old woman, motionless, lifeless... Drawn by an unknown force I enter by the black-shrouded steps! I tremble, but have not the power to turn back!... I look on the dead woman's face... And suddenly, with a mocking grin, It winks at me! Away, terrifying vision! Away! It is terrifying! Terrifying! First, steps out there.... then the door opening... No. No, I can't bear it! I have come to you against my will, But ordered to fulfil your request. Save Liza, marry her And three cards, three cards, three cards In succession will win. Remember! Three... seven... ace! Three, seven, ace! Three, seven, ace! Three, seven, ace! It is close on midnight already, But still no sign of Herman, no sign! I know that he will come and clear away my suspicion. He is the victim of circumstance And could never, never commit a crime! Oh! I am weary and worn out with suffering! Ah! I am weary with sorrow... Night and day only of him I think and I worry... Joy, where have you gone! Oh! I am weary and worn! Night and day only of him I think and I worry... Joy, where have you gone! Life promised me nothing but happiness, Then came a cloud bringing the storm. Oh! I am weary! Oh! I am worn! Anguish gnaws and consumes me... And what if the midnight chimes answer That he is a murderer, a seducer? Oh, I am afraid, afraid! O time, wait but a moment and he will be here . Ah! darling heart, come to me, have pity, pity on me, My husband, my, lord and master! You have come, you have come And you are not a criminal! My agonies are over And once again I am yours! No more of tears, cares and doubts! Once more you are mine and I am yours! But, darling, we must not delay, Time flies... are you ready? - Let's go! - Go where? To the ends of the world with you! Go where? Where? - To the gaming-tables! - O heaven, what is the matter with you, Herman? Piles of gold are waiting there for me, And for me alone! O grief! What are you saying, Herman? Think again! Ah! I forgot, of course you are still in the dark! There were three cards, do you remember, That I still wanted to know from the old witch! O grief! He is out of his mind! Obstinate old rag, she would not tell me them! Well! today she paid me a visit And named the three cards without any pressing. That means that you killed her? Oh no! Why should I? I merely raised my revolver And the old hag suddenly toppled over! Then it was true, then, true! Go away! Who are you? I do not know you! Away! Away! Oh! He is lost! Lost! And I with him! Drink and make merry! Life is a game! Youth passes quickly, Age hurries on! Youth passes quickly, Age hurries on! Tomsky's health! hurrah! If darling girls could fly, like birds And perch upon the boughs, I'd like to be a little bough, Where myriad girls could find a perch Among my twigs. Among my twigs. Bravo! bravo! That's what I call a song! Marvellous! I'd like to be a little bough, Where myriad girls could find a perch Among my twigs. Among my twigs. Ha-ha-ha! Wait, my friends! I think it's time, to the tables! And now, gentlemen, to business - to the tables! - Nine! - I double. - No go! - I bid on the same again. - Good! - Transfer me to ten! My foreboding did not deceive me. I may be needing a second. You will not refuse? Rely on me! Well, friend Herman! You are very late. Where have you been? Come and sit here. You will bring me luck. Where have you been? Where do you come from? Could it be hell, perhaps? But what a sight you are? Couldn't look more awful! Are you ill? I want to make a bid. Wonders will never cease, Our Herman has started punting! I congratulate you, my friend, On breaking your long fast! - How much? - Forty thousand! Forty thousand! That's some stake! You must be mad! Perhaps you learned the Countess's secret of The three cards? Well, do you accept my bet or not? - Certainly! What card? - A three! - A three it is! - He's won! Lucky beggar! There's something wrong here! The wild look in his eye bodes nothing good. - Will you take up your winnings? - No! I am still bidding! He's like the Devil! He scores like a madman! Look, he is not himself! - Does the game go on? - It does. And the card? A seven! - I've von! - He's won again. There's something suspicious about all this! Why, do you look so glum? Are you frightened? Frightened? - Heigh there, wine! - Herman, what's up with you? What is our life? A game! Good and evil - no more than dreams! Work and honour - old wives' tales! Which of you here, my friends, is right or happy? To-day it's you, to-morrow I! So leave your struggles, and seize upon The moment of success! Let the loser weep, cursing his fate! What is true? Death alone, The shore of life's vain sea, Has one single refuge for us all. Which of us is love's favoured one, my friends? To-day it's you, to-morrow I! So leave your struggles, and seize upon The moment of success! Let the loser weep, Cursing his fate! No more play? No, take up your winnings! You seem to have the devil himself on your side! If that's the case, what a pity! - No takers-on? All this on a single card? Well? - I'll take you on! Prince, what's wrong with you? Stop! This is not play, but lunacy! Wait! I know what I am doing! He and I have an account to settle! - You! You take me on? - I do! Deal, Chekalinsky! - My ace! - No, your queen is covered! - What queen? - The one you are holding in your hand - the Queen of Spades! Old witch! You! You here! What are you laughing for? You drove me out of my mind. A curse upon you! What's that? What do you want? A life? My, life? Take it, then, take it! Liza? Are you here? Oh God! Why? Why? And you forgive! Yes? And do not curse me? Ah! How I love you, My angel! My beauty! My Goddess!
