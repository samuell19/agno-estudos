(♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) FUTURE TX: Do you choose your destiny? Or does destiny choose you? Do we have the power of our own free will? Or is choice just an illusion? Who decides what's right and what's wrong? Because if you have the choice to do as you are told or save the world... what would you do? (♪♪♪) DYLAN'S MUM: Dylan! We need you! (SIGHS) Pay-as-you-go is probably fine. I know we're the last two people in the world to get a phone, but it doesn't mean they have to be the lamest. DYLAN'S DAD: Dylan, quick! DYLAN: Sounds like a dadpocalypse. I better go. Destiny awaits. Remember me. -MOLLY: What's your name again? -DYLAN'S DAD: Dylan! DYLAN'S MUM: And no monkey business down the stairs! (♪♪♪) Time to evolve, young man. Wait, there was an improvement there for a second-- Oh, no. It's gone. What did I say to you about those stairs? (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) But Granny loves it. (WHISPERS) Don't you, Granny? Put down the angina china. DYLAN'S DAD: We've got something to tell you. -You're splitting up. -What? No! -I'm adopted? -Is he? You never said. Maybe we could give him back. DYLAN'S DAD: Listen. Dylan. Things are good right now with work. With everything. -But... -But? DYLAN'S MUM: How would you feel if we had to move? -DYLAN: Move house? -DYLAN'S MUM: Mm-hmm. -Where? -Dubai. Dubai in Yorkshire or Dubai in the Arab Emirates? -Is there a Dubai in Yorkshire-- -There isn't. Says you. Listen. The point is, we might be moving to Dubai. And we wanted to check with you first. -To see if it's okay. -DYLAN'S MUM: Yeah. Well, actually-- Actually, we're just being polite. Thing is, we're moving. Is this good-cop- slightly-mediocre-cop? And we're going in two weeks. There is no good cop, is there? Look. We know this is gonna be a big change. But it will be good for you, for us. Yeah! Life's about trusting your instincts, creating your own path. But my instincts say, stay here. Oh, this is way too much emotional stress. Wait. You said I could get a mobile phone. Can I have a really expensive one? MOLLY: He said what? DYLAN: I could have any phone I wanted. -(BIRDS CHIRPING) -It sounds like a trap. What do they want from you. Well... -actually, uh-- -What is it? The washing up? (GASPS) Dancercise! (CHUCKLES) Hold on. It's not dancercise with them. Nothing honestly. Homework, study. Try harder at cricket. But I have this! Come on. Let's do some damage. Wait. Do that Dancercise thing again. No! That never happened. How did it go? Oh, like this? Or this? (♪♪♪) (ATM MACHINE BEEPS, WHIRS) You wrote down the PIN? No one's watching. No one's gonna jump me. I am. (ATM MACHINE BEEPS ERRATICALLY) DYLAN: What? I didn't put the pin in yet. (ATM MACHINE BEEPS, WHIRS) MOLLY: I think it likes you. DYLAN: "Transaction canceled. Your account has not been debited." MOLLY: Free money! How much? Seven hundred and thirty quid. Now that allows for some proper damage. -You can buy me one, too . -(ATM MACHINE BEEPS) -Says you. -Says me. (FOLEY LAUGHS) Time and speed. Close. Everything's close, and yet far apart at the same time. No, yes. Of course, it is. -Oh! Young love! -(WHIRS) -No, we're not. -Maybe your sister. -Uh-uh. -Cousin. -Nope! -German exchange student. Nein. (CHUCKLES) (CHUCKLES) Then perhaps your friend... would like to view our special phones. Lead the way, my good man. Nice design, used only once, so a very special price. Top brand. Running the latest, most sophisticated, gorgeous software. Unbelievable-- Forget those. They're a couple of spicy meatballs. Unbranded. Muy picante. I've got the latest range over here. DYLAN: Well, I've got the latest range right here. Hit me. Oh, um, I'm gonna be needing a receipt. If you must, in exchange for some basic personal details quid pro quo, GDPR, FYI. TCCs apply. (KEYBOARD CLACKING) (♪♪♪) Sale of a century! Two spicy meatballs for the price of one. -(CELLPHONES RINGING) -I think my meatball's ringing. DYLAN: Holy moly! Stupid refurbished phones. Open it! -Open it! -(MOUTHS) I can't hear you. Should we... Dylan! Wait up! We've been burned. Don't you wanna take them back? Mine's bootin' up. Try hitting the power and the home button. (CELLPHONES WHIR, RING) (♪♪♪) -Holier molier! -Should we answer? Together? (PHONE STATIC) -Hello? -Granny? If that's the creepy shop assistant-- -Shh, shh, shh! -(CELLPHONES WHIR) Hell-- FUTURE TX: Listen very carefully. We don't have much time. No, you don't have much time. We're hanging up. FUTURE TX: Dylan, Molly. Listen to me. Who is this? FUTURE TX: All that matters is that you do what I say. Why would we do that? FUTURE TX: Because the world depends on it. -I'm calling from the future. -(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) (CELLPHONES WHIR) Come on. Let's go. DYLAN: Sounded like Barry putting on a voice. Who's Barry? (DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE) Barry. The Bazeroo. The Bazmeister. The Bazmanian Devil. The Bazzer Claus. Barry Barrington. He's always trying to do this. Oh, Barry Wetnose! Nah. He can barely operate one phone at once. And how would he know our numbers? So, who knows our names and our numbers? MOLLY: It's gotta be a prank, or a scam. -But if we-- -MOLLY: Or malware. But if we charge them up, we'll find out more. -(KEYS JANGLE) -Greetings, Lady Slide! Good day to you, Lord Dylan of Wrench. And prey, what devilry is amok today? Hmm? -Your sweat, that's what. -(SNIFFS) That's-- (SCOFFS) Fear not, dear princess, hmm? Now that I have completed my arobicus routine-us, I shall cleanse myself forthwith! Ciao! (CELLPHONES DING) DYLAN: Nothing. It needs a bit of juice first. SAFFRON: Watch out. I might have sweated in that juice. -(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) -Mum! MYOB! SAFFRON: But your business doth be mine, my sweet. MOLLY: What's "Future TX"? Probably 40 quid a month. I am changing the SIM. (CELLPHONES RINGS) (♪♪♪) All right, then. Speak. FUTURE TX: I'm calling from the year 2048. Yeah, right. Your names are Molly Abigail Slide. -Dylan Bertie Wrench. -Bertie? -After my gran. -What do you want? FUTURE TX: We need you to locate a device. Can't you travel back in time with all your future gizmos? We're busy. FUTURE TX: Physical time travel isn't feasible. Only data transmission is possible. What year did you say you were calling from again? FUTURE TX: 2048. Oh, yeah? Prove it. FUTURE TX: I will. Not by something I say. It is something you do. I am confident you will think of something. MOLLY: Hold on. I know something we can do. Two words. Time capsule. Future dude can dig it up. -Mr. Piggles? -(TOY GROANS) MOLLY: You choose again. I won't even look this time. Super secure. (CHUCKLES) Look at your hair. Totally rocking the hairdo. -Says you. -Says me. Dig it. (SOIL RUSTLING) (♪♪♪) -Poor Mr. Piggles. -He was a good pig. So... have you ever heard of a place called Dubai-- (CELLPHONE RINGS, WHIRS) FUTURE TX: I've got it. Oh, yeah? Got what? FUTURE TX: A deposit box. There's a photograph, ripped in half. -A child with bad hair. -(DYLAN CHUCKLES) FUTURE TX: There's a toy. A bear or a pig. And a badge. "Strange." Very apt. There's also a tennis ball with what looks like a hand-drawn emoticon. Okay. You've got our attention. How are you doing this? FUTURE TX: Your devices are enabled with quantum entangled particles. This allows for short periods of one-way communication. -It is called Future TX. -One-way? Does that mean you can call us but we can't call you? FUTURE TX: Correct. But we're having a conversation. FUTURE TX: No. I'm listening to recordings you're making into your phones right now. I'm sending my signal response back. These communications can only be sent to and from the same phones, the original source device. So, you're speaking into the very same phones as us? FUTURE TX: Yes. We're not sure how reliable the system communication will be. But who owns the phones? Where did they come from? FUTURE TX: You're the earliest registered owners. We can't trace the phones any farther back. What we do know is this is all part of the causal loop. This guy's a real fruit loop. -(CHUCKLES) -MOLLY: Proper stranger danger. FUTURE TX: If our loop is to remain consistent, then certain events have to occur. You said something about finding a device before. FUTURE TX: We need you to locate the source of a rogue botnet, so that we can disable it. It's imperative you accept the task, but you must not tell anyone about these phones. And lo, the passing of the sun is near, my sweets. But the sun never sets in my heart knowing there is always tomorrow. Oh, my brave knight. Oh, thank you! SAFFRON: Say your farewells, my sweet. Finely prepared nourishment doth await. -Feel, gob-- Come. -Two minutes, mum! Yeah, now. Come on. FUTURE TX: My access with you is limited. Our communication is pre-set. But I show you more via virtual reality headsets, which, according to our data, you obtain by tomorrow. What you doing? It's all just a stupid game. Checks out so far. No, it doesn't. See, Future TX said the photo was ripped. Give me this right here. (♪♪♪) DYLAN: I think we'll get some VR headsets. Did that all come with your new phone? It's got quantum entangled particles. Oh. Sounds fancy. It receives messages from the future. They've got an app for everything these days. (CLOCK TICKING) (♪♪♪) (CELLPHONE RINGS, WHIRS) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) FUTURE DYLAN: Just be careful. (TABLET RINGING) You up? Did you get the headsets? Yeah, but nothing doing. At least not yet. I did just get this weird call. Someone saying, "Be careful." I don't think it was Future TX. Hmm, more stranger danger. Can't be any worse than you going to Dubai, though. Oh, I... How did-- Your dad told my mom. They only told me this morning. I was gonna... Oh, it sucks. Dubai might not be so bad. They've got robot jockeys on camels. Robot camels? MOLLY: Real camels. Robot jockeys! They go really fast. But I leave in, like, two weeks. We better sort out the future quickly then. But it's too late to meet up now. DYLAN: We've got double PE first thing. We could sneak off in our normal clothes. Follow up what little info we already have. No one's gonna miss us. MOLLY: Physical education is an important part of a student's well being. Hey, just doing my bit for the casual loop. Causal loop. As in, cause and effect. That's what I said. MOLLY: That's what I made you say! (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) DYLAN'S MUM: What about your school uniform? It's dress-down Friday! DYLAN'S MUM: Hold on. It's Tuesday. What can I say? The education system's not what it used to be. (♪♪♪) Maybe we are being scammed. Maybe. (CHUCKLES) Come on. (CELLPHONE RINGING) FUTURE TX: I'm sending a VR file now. (HEADSET WHIRS) Hold on. This is just my street. Yeah. I see the same. FUTURE TX: This is your street now. DYLAN: Whoa! Steady on. FUTURE TX: But this is your street in the future. DYLAN: What future? When? Are my mum and dad okay? Do we go to Dubai? FUTURE TX: The fate of your parents is unknown. But societal breakdown tears families apart. MOLLY: Who's doin' this? DYLAN: What... what happened? FUTURE TX: Over the next few years, your society moves swiftly from the digital age to the quantum age. Quantum computing allows us to code -in a completely new way. -DYLAN: Look. MOLLY: The quantum matrix's grown. FUTURE TX: It transforms society. -Whoa! -MOLLY: Dylan! FUTURE TX: Artificial intelligence monitors our facilities and services. But the AI has been infiltrated, corrupted by a botnet. DYLAN: Whoa, look! Up there. Is that... is that real? Whoa! Can't you fix it? FUTURE TX: Not now. It is too strong. But it activates in your area, in your present day. If you get its password, we will be able to disable it. But where? How do we find a botnet? FUTURE TX: I'm sending you coordinates to where we think it's located. The future looks bleak. Maybe it means you don't go to Dubai. Yeah. But... what happens instead? Only one way to find out. (CELLPHONE DINGS, WHIRS) MOLLY: I don't think we're in the right place. It's close, but the coordinates say... -Dylan! -(DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE) Come on! Never mind the coordinates. It's gotta be this place. (♪♪♪) (DOORBELL RINGS) (BIRD WINGS FLAPPING) -(DOOR CREAKS) -Yes? DYLAN: Hi, I'm Dylan. This is Frau Helga. She's my German exchange student. And she's here to survey your botnets. -Barbara? Is that you? -(MOUTHS) Barbara? Oh! Come on in! (♪♪♪) MRS. BATSTICK: Oh. It's so nice you've come to see me. And you've brought a friend. Um, yeah. This is Dylan. I told you all about him, remember? Ah, yes, yes. Come on in, dear. Don't be shy. Mi casa es su casa. Well, in that casa... (GIGGLES) Sit on down. I'll make you some tea, Bob. And you, too, Dobbin. Let's have a quick look around while she's pleased to see us. What are we looking for again? DYLAN: A botnet. It's like a network of computers... that's controlled by someone. So, I guess we're looking for... a sort of computery thing. It wouldn't surprise me if Mrs. Batstick had a bat cave or something. Good thinkin'. I was joking. I'll take a look upstairs. (♪♪♪) MOLLY: Oh, Dylan loves a ginger bickie, don't you, Dylan? Here we are now. Now then, Barbara. It's so long since you came. Let me take a good look at you. -You're not-- -You're not Mrs. Batstick! -What? -What? (BOTH SCREAM) Keep up, Barb! FOLEY: Hey, not so fast! -(DEVICE WHIRS) -Nice hair dryer, mate! -Oh. (GRUNTS) -(DEVICE BEEPS) -(LAUGHS) -Barbara! (LAUGHS WICKEDLY) MOLLY: Next time Future TX phones, we should quiz this more. Get as much detail as we can. DYLAN: Hey. Try calling me. (CELLPHONE RINGING) Don't answer. Don't wanna waste my credit. That old tramp. The guy with the hair dryer. Maybe he has the botnet? -MOLLY: He looked well dodgy. -Exactly. MOLLY: What if Mrs. Batstick sees us? She can barely see past her own face. So, did you see where he went? (♪♪♪) -(CELLPHONE WHIRS) -(LINE RINGING) Hello? A little help, please. Didn't Future TX say that our part of the conversation was recorded? Maybe we should make a recording now. -(CELLPHONE WHIRS) -Hi, it's us. You know, the girl with the weird hair and her best friend. We're at the location. What should we do now? I know what we should do. MOLLY: A stakeout? Really? DYLAN: This may be a waiting game. MOLLY: What's that for? In case of movement. MOLLY: Watch out for that big, hairy spider that's crawling up your leg. -(LAUGHS) -All good. Stop distracting me. We're trying to focus here. (GRUNTS SOFTLY) (♪♪♪) Time just flies by, but the future's always far away. (♪♪♪) (CAR TYRES SCREECHES) (CAR DOOR CLOSING) -DYLAN: You snore. -MOLLY: Do not. (CELLPHONE RINGING) FUTURE TX: Our data has changed. Did you follow the coordinates exactly? Yes, 100 percent! FUTURE TX: We accessed a message from Molly requesting what action to take. That was, like, two hours ago. FUTURE TX: If you record a message, I don't know when to access it. That is why the phone calls are the most efficient mode of communication. They are quantum tied-- System recalibrating. I thought you said our communication was pre-set. FUTURE TX: The botnet is active, creating changes in our causal loop. Everything relies on the data. MOLLY: How do we know we can trust your data? FUTURE TX: It's the data you provide. MOLLY: At least tell us what we should do about the shed guy. FUTURE TX: His name is Foley. DYLAN: Are you sure he's important? He looks a bit crazy. FUTURE TX: Monitor his movements. Is that it? That is the only data you have? -FUTURE TX: Yes. -Then why are you phoning? -FUTURE TX: Moral support. -(CELLPHONE WHIRS) Nice guy, real team player. Helpful. Must sent him a thank-you card. I'll bury it in my garden. DYLAN: Monitoring his movements isn't getting any data. We should just go talk to him. Dylan-style. Spider! Oh, yeah. That's so Dylan-style. (♪♪♪) MOLLY: Hello? It's a general rule that title by adverse possession cannot be acquired as to public property. QED, this is... this is my gaff. Get your own. Sorry. Um, sir, we were wondering if we could talk to you for a moment. FOLEY: Oh, go away! Sir! FOLEY: Did you knock over my stuff before? Or will you? No, we didn't knock anything. FOLEY: Knock, knock! (LAUGHS) Engine knock theory. Ping. Detonation. Boom! We're here because of the botnet. Oh, great. Subtle. Um, sir, Mr. Foley-- -What did you call me? -MOLLY: Foley! Hey! (GRUNTS) (♪♪♪) (MACHINES BEEP) Who are you? -She's Molly. -He's Dylan. Dolly and Mylan. I got that. Mr. Foley, we thought-- No. I'm not a mister anymore. I... I used to be in the past. In the past. It's funny, isn't it? The past is something you can... you can feel, but you can never touch. Nice, deep. Whereas the future... the future hides its secrets in plain sight. -Hey, that tickles. -(CHUCKLES) -(GRUNTS) -(DEVICE BEEPS) Critical impact. Now, what... what is that? It's happening in three days's time. And I will be there. Will I be there? Three days. Not much time. Never enough time. Mr. Foley, this computer-- Foley? Who told you my name was Foley? We just want your computer. (LAUGHS) Nice hair dryer, mate! Well, at least I've got hair that's still in fashion. Uh, you startled me. But I had a comeback line. -And that was it. -Good one. Nice gag. Top lols. Now, we're all joke buddies, how about that computer then? Well, that is an original G4. That's retro, vintage, and yours for 100 quid. All right, 50 quid. (SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY) That's as low as I can go. Thirty quid. That is my final offer. (COINS CLANKING) DYLAN: Two pound, 20? -I've got five pounds, 65. -That'll do. That'll do. You can owe me the rest. Here we are! It's all yours. Oh. What's the password? No password. No worries. Well, thank you, Mr. Foley-- Thanks. Just thanks. You owe me 22 pounds, 15. Don't forget. (LAUGHS) Don't forget! Twenty-two pounds, 15 for my computer, couple of kids. Dolly and Mylan. And they kept calling me Foley. (SIGHS) Foley. That's me. Oh! Who... -Oh! Help me carry it. -You're doing great. It is so heavy. Come on. -FOLEY: No! -Go, go, go! FOLEY: Wait! Come back! That is not a... DYLAN: Hold up for a sec. (PANTS) Is he chasing us? I can't see him. (♪♪♪) (PANTS) Oh, we've lost him. (GROANS) The weight of the future is heavy indeed. Foley sounded a bit like Mr. Future TX himself to me. Maybe. He did sound a bit nuts. -Check we ditched him. -You check. No sign of Fol... Dylan! Oh! Hello, little fella! (DRONE WHIRS) Whoa! (DRONE FIRES) Right, drop the computer. -What? -Leave it! (DRONE BEEPS) Now, hop it, doofus! (DRONE WHIRS) DYLAN: Do you think Foley sent the drones? (MOTHERSHIP DRONE WHIRS) (♪♪♪) (VAN TYRES SCREECHES) (SCREEN WHIRS, BEEPS) DYLAN: Did you see that? There was something in those darts. Which way, Molly? MOLLY: This leads to the cricket pitch. (DRONES WHIR) Barry! -Who? -DYLAN: Wetnose! Oi, give us that! (DRONE WHIRS, BEEPS) DYLAN: Cheers, Barry. MOLLY: Yeah. Nice one, Wetnose. DYLAN: Well, that's just not cricket. Scarper! (PANTS) Hurry! Whoa! -(CAR HORN HONKING) -(TYRES SCREECHING) -Hey! -Sorry! Just passing through. (GRUNTS) Go, go! There's the door! MOLLY: Why are the drones still chasing us? DYLAN: Far up there, another one! (SCREEN WHIRS, BEEPS) (DRONES WHIR) (SCREEN WHIRS, BEEPS) (BIRDS CHIRPING IN DISTANCE) DYLAN: Split up! You go in the house, I'll go in caravan. (♪♪♪) (DRONE WHIRS) DYLAN: Quick, Molly! It's closing in! Hurry! Hurry! (GLASS SHATTERS) (DRONES CONTINUE WHIRRING) (DRONE WHIRS IN DISTANCE) (DRONE WHIRS) -(DRONE WHIRS) -(OBJECTS CLATTER) (DRONE WHIRS) (TOY WHINES) (DRONE FUSES) (♪♪♪) (DRONE BEEPS, THUDS) -Nice moves. -MOLLY: Come on, let's go. How did you get away? Turns out, they're easily tricked. (DRONE FIRES) (♪♪♪) (TOY WHINES) Maybe we should get one of those drones. -(VAN APRROACHES) -Take it apart. Maybe we should leave it. (CELLPHONE RINGS, WHIRS) FUTURE TX: Did you get the botnet? We're fine. Thanks. FUTURE TX: Leave it somewhere I can find like your time capsule. Slight problem. We lost it again. (CELLPHONE STATIC) FUTURE TX: System recalibrating. Who are these guys? FUTURE TX: Do they have the botnet? Well... we think so. FUTURE TX: Then you must act fast. Access the password. Fix the system. What about them? What do they want? FUTURE TX: Control. What's the difference between fixing the system and having control. FUTURE TX: Whichever side you're on. According to our data, everything leads to something known as critical impact. We assume that's when the botnet takes control. (CELLPHONE WHIRS) License plate. Nice one. (BIRDS CHIRPING IN DISTANCE) -What do we do with it? -Check online. The DVLA. It says it's a blue van. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Not much else. Nothing to go on anyway. MOLLY: I don't like this. (♪♪♪) They're here. The kids. The kids are in danger. Safe. I've got to keep the kids safe! The phones and the kids! I have got to protect them. Drone! (CHUCKLES) Got you. This isn't the time for jokes. We nearly got killed. Ah, it wasn't that bad. What's wrong with you? All right, Miss Serious. Lighten up a bit. But this is serious. -DYLAN: Like, duh! -Oh, my God! You're so frustrating! DYLAN: Molly! Molly! -Mm-hmm. -(LAPTOP WHIRS) Yeah. Yeah, I certainly will. (SIGHS) Thanks for the call. Bye. Oh, stupid computer. Nothing works! Dylan went AWOL. -DYLAN'S DAD: Say again. -DYLAN'S MUM: From school. DYLAN'S DAD: Hey, not so fast, young man. DYLAN'S MUM: Have a good day at school? Look, I... I can explain. There's this guy. He calls me from the future. Says he needs our help. Says we need to find a password for a botnet. Otherwise, the future's in big trouble. But now, they're onto us. Honestly, Dylan, you're making it worse for yourself. -Hand it over. -But, Dad-- DYLAN'S DAD: No. No buts. I'm confiscating it until further notice. DYLAN'S MUM: We leave for Dubai in a week. You said two weeks. What can I say? It's all systems go. No, it isn't. I'm not going to Dubai. I'm not going anywhere. You can go to your room. (CLOCK TICKING) What? All right! All right! I'm doing it! (♪♪♪) (DYLAN'S DAD SNORING) (CELLPHONE CHIMES, RINGS) (WHIRS) -FUTURE TX: New data. -Shh! It's late. FUTURE TX: New data. Critical impact. What are you talking about? Hello? FUTURE TX: No. That would be foolish. Stick to your current line of action. "Line of action"? (CELLPHONE WHIRS) Hey, you. Methinks bed time doth call. (GIGGLES) Enough with the naff routine, mum. Oh, but you know I love it. It harks back to my am-dram days. Hmm. What could have been. The lights, the stage. (SIGHS) Hey, everything all right? -Oh. -The future sucks. I don't know what to do. -Oh. Dylan and Dubai? -Everything. Well, you know what? What will be, will be. Hmm? Doesn't mean you can't have some fun. -What do you mean? -Oh. Live in the moments you have, not in the moments you'll miss. Oh mum, please. You speak like a fortune cookie. -What should I do? -(SIGHS) Molly! (INHALES SHARPLY) Oh, I love you! Hmm? You're always gonna be my wibbly, scribbly, scrumptious little schmoll moll. But, ugh! You really need to take that stick from out your butt. (SIGHS) (BOTH CHUCKLE) -(CUTLERY CLINKING) -Okay, people. Have a great day. Miss me. And, you... no monkey business. -You ready? -DYLAN: For what? School. I'll take you personally. What's the point? We're leaving. Behavior has consequences. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (♪♪♪) (SCHOOL BELL RINGING) This is it. The future's going down the pan. (CELLPHONE RINGING) FUTURE TX: The causal loop is breaking. You have to regain control. Easy for you to say. FUTURE TX: Imperative critical impact. When is this big critical impact? What is it? FUTURE TX: Tomorrow. Critical impact. Tomorrow. Tomorrow? I can't do that. We can't do that. FUTURE TX: You can. You will. You must. (CELLPHONE WHIRS) (DOOR KNOCKING) MOLLY: There you are. You've marked your territory. -Come on. -DYLAN: Where? -MOLLY: Back to inception. -DYLAN: What? What do you mean-- MOLLY: The mobile phone shop. (♪♪♪) (BIRDS CHIRPING) This isn't like you. You're not usually this risky. I'll take that as a compliment. DYLAN: Future TX said that critical impact is tomorrow. If we don't watch out, then the botnet wins. We should take this more seriously. We don't know what we're doing. I didn't take this seriously before. But now, it's real, and... and I don't know how to save the world. I know it's real. It's too real. Everything. And I can't do this by myself either. And you're leaving, remember? To become a stupid robot jockey in Dubai. I'm leaving even earlier now. Next week. It's out of my hands. Let's live in the moments we have, not in the moments we'll miss. What? What I mean is, there are so many things out of control. The one thing we can control is ourselves. That's it. Ourselves! What if I dialed my own number? What if we spoke to ourselves? Future TX said that communication can only be sent to and from the original source device. (CELLPHONE WHIRS, CHIMES) MOLLY: Hold up. You're calling yourself in the past? (CELLPHONE WHIRS) -Someone's answered. -Is it you? I don't know. They're not saying anything. Just be careful. FUTURE DYLAN: Just be careful. "Just be careful"? That's what I said to... to-- he said to me two days ago. Or what I said to him just now. Aw, my head hurts. Right, your turn. But I didn't. I mean, why would I want to call myself? I hate my voice. It's lame. Hold on. If I don't call myself in the past, does that mean I could change the future? (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) We need answers. Let's find creepy shop assistant. (♪♪♪) MYSTERIOUS DUDE: Let me go now, please! DYLAN: Wait. Let me look. MYSTERIOUS DUDE: I haven't done anything. DLYAN: The master of disguise. MYSTERIOUS DUDE: Hey! DOMINIC: Hey! Hey! Psst! Monkey boy! Yeah you, Planet of the Apes. Have you got one of those phones from the future? 'Cause I have one, too. Tempus fugit. Wait here. (LOCK CLICKING) Listen here. What did you say your name was again? DOMINIC: Dominic Santiago. But you can call me... The Black Wheel. Street artist extraordinaire. Don't worry. It's safe in here. They won't find us. -DYLAN: Who? -Well, anyone, everyone. We're being tracked on cameras, phones, transactions. Don't worry. I've earthed the place. My cousin Leroy helped me. Simple Faraday cage. No signals. I'll show you mine if you show me yours. See, no signal. DYLAN: So, where did you get your phone? DOMINIC: I was on the streets, finishing a new original piece -when I was spotted by a fan. -MRS. BATSTICK: Barbara! Barbara! DOMINIC: So, I made a smooth getaway. (SCREAMS, GRUNTS) DOMINIC: But then I saw it. Strange lights. -Had to check it out. -(MACHINES BEEP) Had to get out of there fast. (MACHINES BEEP ERRATICALLY) (EXPLOSIONS) Oh! What? I kept one for myself and gave the other two to a mate of Leroy's, guaranteeing their safety. Well, you know what happens when you have one of those phones for a while. (CELLPHONE RINGING) -Hello? -(CELLPHONE WHIRS) What did Future TX tell you? To look out for you two. That you'll be messing things up looking for the botnet. Thanks a lot. DOMINIC: Well, everything else he's said so far has been true. I mean, you do look like a couple of noobs. Ever get the feeling you're being played? That's exactly what Future TX said you'd say. Do you know who Future TX is? No. But the phones use some kind of quantum particles to work. -Quantum entanglement. -Exactly. And get this, there's a company called QuantaCrypt and a guy called Foley, who made, or will make some sort of breakthrough. -Yes. We know him. -Did you get his password? Apparently, that's the key to the botnet. No. MOLLY: We had to drop the computer. -What computer? -Foley's. -You mean he still has it? -Has what? His phone. We don't know anything about his phone. DOMINIC: That's the source of the botnet. Or at least it will be. He invented it. And programmed it to spread to any device it can find. We have to go back to Foley's. What about QuantaCrypt ? Do you think they're the ones chasing us? -The dodgy van, the drones. -(CELLPHONE CHIMES) She's right. We should go back to Foley's. Leave your stuff there. "She"? Who's "she"? Future TX. The woman that calls me from the future. What has she told you? MOLLY: Our guy barely tells us anything. DYLAN: Do you trust her? Do you trust your Future TX? Isn't it fun finding out? (CELLPHONE RINGING) (♪♪♪) DYLAN: New number. MOLLY: Mine's not ringing. Who is it? -DYLAN: It doesn't say. -Answer it. -(CELLPHONE WHIRS) -Hello? Hello? DOMINIC: Have... have you... Have we what? Have we found the botnet? DOMINIC: Have you been in an accident that wasn't your fault? (LAUGHS) You should have seen the look on your faces. -(LAUGHS) -MOLLY: It's not funny! Oh, the botnet. The botnet. My big fat botnet! It's not funny! -(DOMINIC SCREAMS) -(LAUGHS) -(GRUNTS) -(LAUGHS) (LAUGHS) You noobs! (SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY) ...The Black Wheel! (SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY, LAUGHS) (♪♪♪) What's happened here? -DOMINIC: Where's Foley? -FRANCIS: Right here. Whoa! Extreme makeover. Thank you, Dominic. I'll take it from here. I'm Foley. Francis Foley. Pleased to meet you. The Foley that you've met is my brother. Ben Foley. Brothers? Twins? What was that expression you used, Dominic, "A couple of noobs"? Now, I'm starting to feel played. FRANCIS: The times is really short now. So, if you come with us... You've got the wrong kids. She's Barbara. And I'm the famous Barry. My friends call me Wetnose. You're going to have to trust me. Whoa! Drones! I'll have one of them. We're doing this for your own safety. You don't have to hurt them. (LINE RINGING) FUTURE TX: There's no answer. The causal loop is broken. FEMALE VOICE: Good. Good. Good. -(MACHINES BEEPING) -Dylan. -I'm scared. Dylan? -Yeah. I'm... I'm here. I'm scared, too. But at least we're together. Shh, shh, shh. Someone's coming. Pretend to be asleep. I'm sorry about these syringes. A harmless sleeping serum. And the binds, just a simple safety precaution. To keep who safe? You? From us? To keep the future safe. You two are a little unpredictable right now. (♪♪♪) You've broken the loop. But I really only need to know one thing. Where is he? Who? -Help us out a little. -Oh, no! No! Here, here! We don't know where he is, okay? Critical impact. Stay mobile. Stay mobile. DYLAN: And you showed up. Now, listen. My brother isn't very well. He was the one who invented this Future TX technology. We both did, right here. But the work took its toll most heavily on him. He couldn't grasp the potential of this devices. A hotline from the future to the past. And all I want to do is protect him and the future. I would keep everything safe. So, you want to stop the botnet? I'm afraid the botnet-- it can't be stopped. It can perhaps be controlled. The future is on a knife edge, and my brother holds the key. And you two... (SIGHS) You've just been on the wrong side all this time. (SIGHS) Well... you've got to understand that it really doesn't matter whether you believe me or not. Right now, I separate you. What? You mean split us up? It's just how it happens. I'm not going anywhere without Molly! -Dylan! -DYLAN: Molly! (DOOR CLOSING) (♪♪♪) FRANCIS: Welcome to QuantaCrypt, Dylan. If you've never been around a major scientific discovery that will change mankind, this is what it looks like. Beautiful, isn't it? Don't worry. Perhaps you don't understand the real significance of all this. Neither did my brother. Luckily, I do. Oi, Dominic Santiago! Up yours-- (ALARM BEEPS) Get some rest. (MOUTHS) I'll be back soon. DOMINIC: What happens now? We put our faith in the future. Come along, Dominic! Let's get that phone of yours back to the lab. Well, actually, first, I thought we might-- Talk about what we do next. That's right. (CELLPHONE VIBRATES) -DOMINIC: Actually... -(CELLPHONE WHIRS) -...I need the toilet. -Oh, well, if you must. I assume you can handle yourself from here. I'll take that back to the lab myself. DYLAN: Come on, think, think. Creepy shop assistant sells us these phones. Future TX calls us and gets us involved. We check out and it leads us straight to Mad Foley. Then the Dominic doublecross leads us straight to Handsome Foley. The people in the future knew it would play out like this. Because if it didn't... then they wouldn't be able to call us. Because they wouldn't have the phones. Which means... we've been puppets all along. Which means... you're stuck... idiot. -(METAL CREAKS) -(DOMINIC GRUNTS) Lift me up. DYLAN: No way, Jose. DOMINIC: Look. I'm sorry, okay? Foley told me you were the bad guys. And Future TX-- my Future TX didn't tell me the whole story. And I don't like being pushed around. Is the wheelchair a scam, too? DOMINIC: Hey. I crawled to get here. Don't make me regret it We need to find Molly. Do you know where she is? DOMINIC: I think so. DYLAN: All right. Go back. Go back. Hold on a sec. -Tere's a sharp edge here. -(DOMINIC GRUNTS) Get these ties off. There we go. (GRUNTS) Giddy up. You crawled all the way here? DOMINIC: I heard you talking earlier. It was very nice, emotional. But I get what you mean. We've been puppets. Don't worry. I've got your back. -Well, not really. Hold up! -(GROANS) How do I know you're not just leading me back to Foley again? DOMINIC: Why would I go through all of that effort? -Well, how can I trust you? -How can I trust you? What if this is all just one, big joke, and you're all in on it? The only thing that matters right now is getting Molly. So, get a move on. It comes with a curse. (PANTS) We're moving together, have a few laughs. (♪♪♪) DYLAN: Did you come this way before? Um, no. -Better out than in. (BOTH SCREAM) (BOTH GRUNT) (BOTH GROAN) -Oh, shoot! -(GROANS) We need to get Molly. We can't just wheel back in there. Hmm. We need some equipment. Well, a wheelchair will be kind of useful. There! (OBJECTS CLATTERING) You sure we can't be traced here? DOMINIC: I told you... (SIGHS) Faraday cage. No signals. Don't worry about it. DYLAN: But how did you end up working with QuantaCrypt? They found me online. They said they'd turn me in for nicking their phones and being The Black Wheel. Unless I helped them find all three phones and get them back. But with my legs and my spinal injury, there's not a cure at the moment. But Foley said there could be. Gene therapy they call it. I'd like to know what the future holds. And everything Foley said with the phones and the future has come true. But now... DYLAN: Now? I don't like being played. (♪♪♪) The Black Wheel rides again! (SCREEN WHIRS) DYLAN: There's your wheelchair. Yes! We're on the right track then. (♪♪♪) (DOOR OPENING) Go, go! FOLEY: All right. New future. And have some confrontation with you, I can tell back! (ALARM BEEPS) DYLAN: Okay. When the security geezer comes out, we'll rush it. What are you doing? DYLAN: Closest thing I have to a weapon. -You ready? -What? No! DYLAN: You scared, Black Wheel? No. Thought we could be doing better. (♪♪♪) -Black Wheel strikes back! -DYLAN: You ready? -Three... -DYLAN: Two... -One. -(DYLAN SCREAMS) (CHUCKLES) Whoa! DOMINIC: I mean, we came to save you. What as? Baboon Bertie and Stupid Stocking Face? DYLAN: It's okay. We can trust him. He's been played just like us. Do you still have your Future TX phone? -No. Foley took it from me. -You know where they are? (♪♪♪) -Password. Password. -(SCREEN WHIRS) Oh. (SIGHS) Why were they asking about that? Is it to do with critical impact? (DEVICE WHIRS, BEEPS) Let's just grab them and go. -It's all a bit easy. -What? This! Us! Escaping, getting Molly. Grabbing the phones. -Speak for yourself. -Yeah, but... no one's tried to stop us. Knocking someone out with a tray. -Does that even work? -Felt like it did. It's all part of what's supposed to happen. MOLLY: At this point, who cares? -(ALARM BLARING) -MOLLY: See! Not that easy! -The phones, they're booting up. -(CELLPHONES WHIR) FUTURE TX: You don't have to worry, Mr. Foley. It's not Foley. It's us. FUTURE TX: Of course. Regrettable. But the children did their best. It's us, Dylan and Molly. FUTURE TX: Critical impact. Everything changes. -What's happening? -Causal loop, it's broken. FUTURE TX: Yes, I am the botnet. But we can control the future together now that the phones are safe. DOMINIC: What's it saying? Future TX is the botnet. FUTURE TX: I couldn't risk all of my work being undone. I... I... I-- Critical impact. Critical impact. Critical impact. We can still stop the botnet. -Prevent critical impact. -(CELLPHONES WHIR) Crazy Foley said he'd be there then it happened. Let's go find him then. Critical impact. -(CELLPHONE CHIMES) -Which way? Future TX says, "Go right." Wait. Now, she says, "Turn left." Where are the kids? Straight ahead. Do our own thing, our own way. Hold on. Hold on. Critical impact must be something that changes everything. Oh no, girl. Come on! We can do this. An event that alters the future. MOLLY: Keep moving! This is it. It's about to happen. Forward, forward. No. Molly, wait! No! (♪♪♪) (GROANS) You... she... she just... Oh! DYLAN: Molly. Molly? It doesn't happen like this, does it? Critical impact. Ambulance. Please. Coastguard. Anyone, everyone! -(SCREEN WHIRS) -Heartbeat. That's good. That's good. Yes! Yes! A non-critical impact this has been. (SIGHS) -Foley, your phone. -My phone? Give me the password. We have to change this! The past, the future, everything! FRANCIS: I'll take that. You could help... help this girl. That's all technology was ever meant to do. -To help people. -Maybe in the past. But now, it can do so much more than that. More than you could have foreseen. You got left behind, Ben. Come on, Dominic. -You're with me. -No. I'm not being pushed around anymore. (CELLPHONE RINGS, CHIMES) The future is on the line. This couldn't have worked out better. I think you'll all agree. MRS. FUTURE TX: Uh-uh. Incorrect. You've been played. Who is this? MRS. FUTURE TX: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four... What's going on? MRS. FUTURE TX: Oh, you'll find out in three, two, one. What? MRS. FUTURE TX: Turn around now. -(CELLPHONE CLATTERS) -(BODY THUDS) (GROANS) (♪♪♪) FOLEY: I see. Of course. I... I think you better take this. Hello? MRS. FUTURE TX: Dylan. Listen very carefully. Right now, there's a young girl injured on the ground. I know you're scared. But she's going to be okay. What about the botnet? MRS. FUTURE TX: Thanks to critical impact, Foley, the nice Foley, makes a breakthrough with the botnet. He's able to salvage all the damage it did. The future's safe. You saved us. How? MRS. FUTURE TX: QuantaCrypt Foley said he was trying to create his own version of the causal loop. So, we had to give him false information and try to help you instead, to make sure things happened the way they should right up to critical impact. But we didn't know what it was or what it meant. Now, we do. It's you and Molly. But what about us? What about the future? MRS. FUTURE TX: Let's just say robot camels are waiting for you in Yorkshire. And there's a bigger future ahead for the both of us. -Says you. -MRS. FUTURE TX: Says me. -Molly? -MRS. FUTURE TX: I'll go now. I never did like the sound of my own voice. (CELLPHONE WHIRS) (CELLPHONE CLATTERS) Molly! Molly! Easy. I thought I'd lost you. We did it, Moll. We won! FOLEY: I'll take care of all this. There's no time like the present! And no present like the time. Now, go! (♪♪♪) It's time for us to make amends for our past, my dear brother. (POLICE SIRENS WAILING) (CELLPHONE WHIRRING) MRS. FUTURE TX: Do you choose your destiny? Or does destiny choose you? Do we have the power of our own free will? Or is choice just an illusion? Is human behavior essentially predictable? Well, only sometimes. (CELLPHONE RINGING) MRS. FUTURE TX: Listen very carefully. We don't have much time. Future TX phase one complete. Initiating phase two in three... two, one. (CELLPHONES WHIR) (♪♪♪) CHILDREN (CHANTING): Nelson! Nelson! Nelson!
