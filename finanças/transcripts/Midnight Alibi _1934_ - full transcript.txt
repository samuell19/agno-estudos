Alderman shot. Get the paper. Read about it. Alderman shot. Paper! Good morning, Senator. - Good morning, Charles. Well, what's new in the journalistic world? Oh, nothing much. Someone plugged an alderman. But he lived. That's too bad. I hear Lance gets in on the boat this morning. He's stopping at The Manton. Just charge this to my account, Charles. - Sure. Read all about it. Alderman shot. And what do you think the Doc says is the matter with me? I give up. - My blood pressure. What's wrong with it? It's higher than a cat's back. And the Doc says I got to be awful careful what I eat. And to watch my emotions. Or I might pop off all of a sudden. Say, I just heard Lance gets in this noon on the boat. He's going to stop at The Manton. - Yeah? Don't die. What do you want, Louis? Have you seen Babe the Butcher around? - In back. Thanks. Ah, sure I can. I've busted tougher ones than that. Hey, wait a minute. I'll give you ten that you can't. 0kay, I'll take that. - It's a bet. Now look at this you mugs. Keep your eye right on that spot right there. See, didn't I tell you I could do it? You sure did, Butch. Alright, pay him off that bet. It was worth ten bucks to see you put your head through that door. Hello Babe. Hello, Louis. What you looking for? - My hat. I'll find it. Here it is. I hear Lance gets in on the boat this noon. Alright. Thanks. Oh Maria, do you suppose we've missed him? I don't know. But I'm doing an awful lot of hoping. [ Ship's horn ] [ Ship's horn ] There he is. Hello, Charlie. Oh, hello. For a minute I got a chill, thinking you'd ducked out not saying goodbye. Well I was so excited I nearly rushed off. But Maria wanted to see the passengers disembark. Didn't you, Maria? Oh yes. I've never seen them do it before. I want you to know it's been swell knowing you. Even if it only has been for the last two days. Young man, next time don't spend so much time in the card room. You bet your life I won't. If we are going to get through the customs I suggest .. Oh yes, Maria. I nearly forgot about that. Here, you can start with the trunks. Now that old frozen-pan has gone .. Tell me this "goodbye" business is a lot of hooey. I'm afraid it isn't. What are you holding on to me for, baby? Can't you even tell me where you live? Well, let's end it this way. It's much more exciting. You tell me your name's Johnson, yet the Purser has your ticket. It's: "Morley". You said you were Eddie Kay but you're on the passenger list as Lance McGowan. I know, but .. You must come and declare some stuff. The young man says that .. Alright, Maria. I'll be right with you. It's been awfully nice knowing you. Goodbye, Lance. - Oh, wait a minute. Pardon me. [ Door knocks ] Oh, it's you. Forty-six years old and he still doesn't know how to turn a doorknob. Where is the boss? He is just finishing his ablutions. - Oh. Why don't you put the red 9 on the black 10? Hello, Hughie. - Hello boss. Great to see you back. Say, I don't guess you heard about my blood pressure? Lay off. It's 8-3. He heard it by wireless on the boat. Well. How did the pasteboards work for you on the water? Rotten. The only nibble I get is I give a fish a 200 buck win for a come-on .. So I can knock him off the next night. The following day he's seasick and there is no more play. I knew you were wrong trying to work them boats in a card game. Will you shut your trap before something gets caught in it. And who busted you on the noggin? Nobody. I busted myself. On a bet. How much did you win? - Ten bucks. What did the doctor charge? Ten bucks. You must be getting a sense of humor. Well, to get down to the facts. Any of you birds got any mackerel? I ain't had more than a dime at one time since you went away. Things have been tough, Lance. The town ain't the same since repeal knocked joy water into soda fountains. Well, who has all the potatoes anyway? And how did he get them? Angie the Ox has just about collected all the stray dollars in town. One way or another. Angie the Ox? Yeah. He's made himself head man. I remember him when. He used to be in Brooklyn. Well, well. So Angie is head man, eh? What's his angle? Well, it seems that gambling is still against the law. So there is lots of dough in it. He's running a joint, eh? All kinds of them. Got them all over town. From small crap games to the big Hummingbird Club. That's his hangout. That gives me a swell idea. We'll take a gander at one of their games. Listen boss, I got blood pressure. The Doc says I can't have no excitement. Call a taxi. Hey, Sam. Hello Rusty. What's the score? Why everything .. Everything is about even. Who's shooting? - You. You are, Lance. Thanks. That's nice of you. Who's backing the game? I .. I am. And he threw ten. Five hundred to a thousand I could make the ten. Right. Eight. Five. Ha! Ten. I guess that will be all for tonight. Thanks. In case you're interested, I made it the hard way. Two fives. Say, he didn't shoot a ten. Hey, you mugs! Shut up. Go on with the game. - Place your bets. I'm telling you Angie. How can I tell if throws a ten or not? When he don't let nobody see in the hat. Yeah, he plays black and red on my wheel for a half hour and I never see his bet. Thanks to Hughie for knocking over my markers every time I spin the ball. And you should see the way him and the Senator take me on Blackjack. By making me deal their own deck. Where is Lance hanging out? - At The Manton. Let's go and see him. Keep your eyes open, Nick. You guys wait here. I'll talk to you later. [ Door knocks ] It seems we've got callers. I've got a suspicion I know who it is. - Who? 0pen it up. My blood pressure is going up and up. Well, hello Lance. When did you get back in town? Yesterday. Put it down on that, Angie. Oh. Thanks. Did you have a nice trip? - Not much excitement. Looks like you stepped out last night to find some. I thought I'd hit a few of the spots. The trouble is you happened to hit the wrong spots. This ain't a warning, is it? Or .. is it? More than that. You've been away for some time, Lance. I took over while you were gone. Things have been nice and quiet. Now, I ain't expecting any volcano but I'm ready for one, see. You keep out of my hair. Or they'll be asking what's become of Lance McGowan. Did you get that? That's what I call "getting told." Yeah? You fellows get in your evening clothes. Meet me back here at 9 o'clock tonight. Why, where are we going? - Right up to his main joint. The Hummingbird Club. Good evening, Angie. Good evening. Good evening, sir. Good evening, Angie. - Hello, Nick. Thank you. Will you wait up the mezzanine for me? I have to see a guy here about business. You look awfully nice. - Thank you, Angie. Open it up. - You got a card? Yeah, but I don't feel like showing it. Sure Lance. Come in. What's the matter with you, Lance? You jumped like someone hit you with a peashooter. I see someone I know. You boys wait here. I'll be right back. Hello beautiful. Why, hello mister .. What is out there? - A balcony. Good. I see the way this evening is starting out, we'll all end up in caskets. What a fine thing to say to a guy having a tough time controlling his emotions. What are you doing here? When you look at me like that I don't even know what country I'm in. If you keep saying words like that you make me feel you're in love with me. In love with you? Why, this morning at breakfast I saw you sitting across the table from me. And at lunch you were sitting right beside me. How was I for dinner? Baby, after that I was so excited I couldn't eat for the rest of the day. You are flattering me. And I love it. Did you miss me? - Maybe. Did you think about me? Maybe. Well, are you glad to see me? You're darn tooting, mister. What are you thinking of? I was looking at that old house over there. That old place? There's something strange and mysterious about it. Yeah. Boris Karloff is probably wandering around inside making strange noises. Who lives there? You don't know much about this town do you. - Why? Everybody knows that house. An old doll by the name of Abigail Ardsley lives there. It doesn't look much like a doll's house. Who is Abigail Ardsley? - The richest old lady in the world. Her father left her all kinds of potatoes. Very thoughtful of him. Yeah, you see he bought up real estate very cheap .. Before people saw it would be valuable later for fruit stands and cigar stores. Nick. What? Lance McGowan has come in with the boys. - Lance McGowan? You're kidding? - No. That ain't the half of it. Where are they? - The boys are in the lounge. Lance is on the balcony with Joan making a play for her. Is that straight? - Just as straight as that. Tell Herman to meet me in the office right away. - 0kay. Herman. Place your bets. Can you keep a secret? Sure. You are a very interesting young man. Are you sure that sprinkling can is in the car? - Right, Chief. Herman. Lance McGowan is looking for a showdown. This time he is going to get it. He'll be leaving pretty soon. I can't keep up the kidding. What do you mean? - I've been kidding on the level. I said a couple of things to you on the boat that I meant. I said some nice things to you too. And you meant them? Yes. But you walked out on me. I didn't want to. Joan. Hello, Angie. Hello. You're coming along with me. Goodnight, Mr McGowan. Goodnight. Now please don't be angry, Angie. I met him on the boat. Yeah? Well, we'll talk about that later. I'm taking you home now. Oh, but Angie. - Come along. Of course it's not my business, Lance. But that's the same as asking for it. What is? Playing around with Angie's kid sister. His sister? That is Angie's sister? - I should say. And Angie he watches her like an owl. He had her in Europe just to keep her away from mugs like you. Where does she live? - How should I know. Well find out. Well. If I'm not being too inquisitive. What do you we do now? You do what you like. I'm off home. I thought we came here to do business. Not tonight. I changed my mind. You fellows go ahead. I'm going to walk. Walk? - Yes, I got some thinking to do. Perfect. You take him. [ Gunshot! ] [ Gunshot! ] We missed the mug! - Where'd he go? He must have hopped that truck. - Beat it, Eddie. Good evening. I said, good evening. Yeah. Good evening. Won't you sit down? Sit down? - Yes. It is many years since a young man came into my living room. So, you're the "old doll"? I mean .. you're Abigail Ardsley? Yes .. how did you know me? The papers. This is your house, isn't it? - Yes. I'm sorry I busted in on you this way, but I .. Did you know that door was open? It has been unlocked for a great many years now. Forty-five years to be exact. It's lucky a lot of guys in this town didn't know that. Oh, you look so like him. It's as if you had stepped out from the past. What do you mean? Many years ago a young man came through that same door. He looked like you. He was dark, as you are. So young. So handsome. And so good. Look. Yeah. He does kind of look like me. But then a lot of people look like a lot of other people. I was young then too. Yeah, and I'll be good looking. Why should I trouble you with a foolish old lady's memories. Lady, I got lots of time to kill. Go on, who was this guy? His name was Robert Anders. What's your name? - Lance McGowan. From an old New York family? - No. No, my folks all came from Ireland so you can't connect me up. What did this guy do to you? We were very much in love. Miss Abigail is eighteen today. Here we are. Thank you. Mrs Hancock. It is so nice to be here. - Delighted to have you. Colonel. - Thank you. - Glad you could come. Oh, Anders. I suppose you call to pay your respects? Why, I .. Miss Ardsley was good enough to invite me, sir. Oh, I see. Miss Ardsley, permit me to offer my .. - Watts. You may take Mr Anders wraps. Will you come with me, sir. I'd rather you wouldn't invite my clerks to your parties, Abigail. Please do me the courtesy of asking my advice after this. Yes, father. These young upstarts are hard enough to handle as it is. Mr Ardsley - my daughter. How do you do. Mr Anders, it is so nice of you to come. It's a very great honor, Miss Ardsley. I wish you every happiness on your birthday. Thank you. Abi. May I have this waltz? I've been saving it just for you. Darling. I love you. Shush. Someone may hear you. I don't care. I've looked all over for you. I thought you'd never come. I walked around the square six times. Afraid to come in. Afraid? Afraid I couldn't stand sharing you with all these people. I hate parties. Too many people come to them. We could come into the garden. - They'd find us. We'd have until they did. You're lovely tonight, Abigail. Lovelier than I've ever seen you. I hoped you'd think that. And you look very elegant in your new suit. It's lucky I have a friend my size. Abi. How long can we keep it up? This deception, I mean. - When you touched my hand and I .. I thought they all must know. I could hardly keep from shouting out loud that I loved you. Father wondered why I was so nervous. I should never have made love to you. You couldn't help yourself. I encouraged you. I should have remembered the difference between us. Please don't say that. I have nothing to offer you. I don't want anything. Your father will never consent to your marrying one of his clerks. He'll have to. I'll never marry anyone else. It's a pity I'm so poor. Don't think of that. Not now. We have so few moments together. Let's not spoil this one. Watts. Have you seen Miss Abigail? - A few moments ago. She was dancing. It's too beautiful here isn't it. Much too beautiful. If this garden had been made for nothing else. It would have been well worthwhile. Abigail. I think you had better go into the house. Please father, I .. - Come along. Please let me explain, sir. I don't care to hear any explanations. Don't you think it's presumptuous .. For a low clerk to take advantage of my hospitality this way? We had hoped that you might consent to our marriage. We didn't ask to fall in love but we did. - Ridiculous! I don't want any of your money. Anders, you are probably a very nice young fellow. But my daughter is an Ardsley. And you are a clerk. But I don't intend to remain a clerk. That's a matter that concerns only yourself. Also I am sorry, but your connection with the firm is a thing of the past. Very well, sir. Then I shall marry Abigail without your consent. I have stood as much of your impertinence as I intend to. Leave at once. And I warn you. Never let me see you again. My hat and coat please. - Very good, sir. Robert. - We had it out. I shouldn't have left you. - It's better that you did. Goodnight. - Goodnight. After he's gone to bed. Yes. The house is filled with your guests. It might be well if you helped entertain them. I'll speak to you about this matter later. That's the last of the guests, Watts. You may now lock up and turn out the lights. Yes, sir. Darling. There are tears in your eyes. I know. I am sorry. Do you really love me? With all my heart. Will you come away with me? You mean .. run away with you? I'll work my fingers to the bone for you. Do anything, everything for you. But father? Then he'd never forgive us. Can't we wait, Robert? Let me talk to him. Maybe I can make him understand. You'll never make him understand. Darling .. it is tonight or never. Don't say that. - Then you'll come away with me? Now? I am so afraid, Robert. Please give me time to think. Tomorrow perhaps. Then you don't love me enough to come away with me. I love you enough, Robert. But I can't. Not tonight. Not like this. I'll tell you in the morning. Goodnight, darling. Yes, sir? A trespasser in my garden. I want you to arrest him. There he goes. Abi. Abi. Abi! Abi. Open the door. [ Gunshot! ] Robert. Robert, darling. Please don't cry, dear. Oh my dear. Hold me closer. Isn't he one of your guests, sir? If it had to be. I'm glad it's like this. It's probably best. I might have ruined your life. It's ending while it's beautiful. Too beautiful. I never spoke to my father again as long as he lived. No man ever came in or out of that door or any other door in this house. Until your appearance tonight. But the door has always remained open. In case some young man came. Seeking shelter. Shelter is right. What did your Papa have against this young guy? My father considered him beneath me. He was a clerk and poor. I'm in a fix like that myself. It seems a guy always gets into trouble the minute he falls for a doll. You are in trouble? Plenty. My girl has got a brother. And he objects to you? Well, we don't just laugh at each other's jokes. He don't like to see her run around with a mug like me. And he ordered you out? - Something like that. Oh, my boy. Love is the most beautiful thing in the world. When that is gone. There is nothing else to live for. I have found that out. Lady. You took a tough rap, sweetheart. I mean. That's tough, kid. I'm sorry I wept. Robert always hated to see tears in my eyes. Listen sweetheart, I know what you need. You got a little drink in the joint? I should have thought to offer you something. Will you ring? Gee. If I had known there was an old doll .. An old lady like you living here alone and the door was wide open .. I'd have paid you a visit many a time. That's very nice of you. You rang, Miss Abigail? Watts. You may bring us some wine and a biscuit or so. Yes, Miss. I'd like to have had one poke at that Papa of yours. It seems to me that your young lady has a brother that needs a little .. poking. You said it. I don't like to think that both of your lives might be ruined as mine was. I'm in a tough spot. You see, she's kind of out of my class. That should make no difference. Not if she loves you. That's something I don't know. - You should find out. - How? Talk with the girl. Ask her. Well, maybe you're right. Of course I am. Thanks. To romance. - Yeah. To romance. If your girl has courage and she loves you .. That's all you need. You're a good sport, sweetheart. You're not half as crazy as they think. Thank you. You will go to the girl? Sure I will. First thing in the morning. Now I guess I'd better be running along. There's lots of people may be worried where I am. I will see you to the door. You will let me know? - Sure. Well, thanks. You'd better stay here, sweetheart. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Hey, wait a minute. I know what I want to say but I just can't get the right words. I keep my fingers crossed hoping you express yourself better than you draw. To put it in a nutshell, I guess you know I'm poison to your brother. I gathered that. I suppose I'm not much of a guy. I guess I'm about as bad as a guy can be, but .. If it makes a difference to you, I can start playing it straight from now on. I admire you for saying that, Lance. See, I'm daffy about you. Lance, are you really trying to tell me that you're really in love with me? That's the general idea. If you'll give me a tip off on how I stand then I'll know what to do. Do? Oh, you're thinking of Angie? That's why I've got to know how you feel. If you're as daffy about me as me about you .. Oh Lance, I'm so sorry. But I'm afraid we've drifted into something that is all my fault. I like you very much. But can't you see that it wouldn't work out? Yeah. I get it. I'm sorry. - Oh, forget it. Can't we shake hands and be friends? Sure. Anyhow, you are one of the best things that ever happened to me. So long. Lance! I thought I could let you go. But I couldn't. Don't you ever scare me again like that. Don't talk any more, darling. Going down? - Cancel it. I beg your pardon, Miss. There is a man to see you. A man? Possibly a gentleman. Has the gentleman a name? He undoubtedly has, Miss. But I couldn't quite catch it. It sounded something like .. "MacTabbert". Was it "McGowan"? Quite possibly, Miss. Please show Mr McGowan in. But Miss, there is likely to be damage done. He has a .. - And Watts. Please show Mr McGowan in. Very well, Miss. What on earth have you there? - A dog. And rather a large one. - I brought him for you. For me? Yes. I got to think about the door of yours being open and .. Knowing what I do about the guys in this town I felt maybe you need a watchdog. Anyway, I had to bring you something. - I appreciate the thoughtfulness but .. But don't you think he's just a bit .. Well .. too large for me? Yeah, I thought of that too. But then I didn't know what kind you'd like. Come here. Looks like the last round-up. - Very funny. It's a hound round-up. I started out with Prince Albert and now I end up with a fur coat. Take your pick. I think I can be quite content with that little wire-haired terrier. You mean the little white one? - Yes. Alright. Come on, Baron. Come on, boy. Do you think you can manage the Baron? Manage him? If he were saddled, I could ride him. She wants the little white one. They are some watchdogs. Here's her pedigree. - Take the rest of them back. Take them back. Come along you. Come on, come on. Ooh, how lovely. What's his name? Miss Skippy. Come here, Miss Skippy. Come here. Oh, you little rascal. Her father's name was "Percy the 3rd" and her dame was "Little Patty". It's quite the nicest gift I ever received. Well, I wanted to bring you something. You did me such a good turn. That sounds like the visit to your young lady had been successful. Yeah. And you found she returned your admiration? Well I don't like to boast, but I think I am head man. When will you be married? Well, I don't know. There is still Joan's brother. - Joan? That's a pretty name. Her brother is not so pretty. - He still objects? He don't know. Oh, I'm sure you'll be able to explain it to him. You don't know that guy. You'll not let him come between you? I haven't figured it out yet. If you allow anyone to come between you and your Miss Joan .. You will both regret it until your dying day. I know. He's a pretty tough egg. Nonsense. Why, you young men are just a lot of bad little boys. That's all he is. Plenty bad. There is only one thing for you to do. Go to him. Talk to him gently. If you are sincere and tell him you really love his sister .. And that you are going to try to make her very, very happy. I'm sure he'll withdraw his objections. Sweetheart, you got me sold. You were right the first time. I will keep my money on you. Well. He won't be there for 2 or 3 hours, but I'll see him later tonight. You are a fine young man. You know. From now on I'm going to try to be. Here. - Thank you. I'll let you know how it goes if you're interested. Why, of course I am. Goodnight, sweetheart. Goodnight, Mr McGowan. - Call me Lance. Good luck, Lance. Hello, McGowan. - Hello. Hey Lance, you'd better take this rod with you. You know I never carry a gat. It makes my Tux bulge. You ain't going in without your jewellery are you? Why, not? This ain't a war talk. Hello pal. Open up. Sure. How are you tonight, Lance? Hello Nick. Where's Angie? Up in his office? I think so yes, Lance. Why? Come in. Hello. I thought I told you to keep your nose out of my face. Take it easy, Angie. I just came here to have a talk with you. My blood pressure is doing loo-de-loops. I don't like the looks of it, Babe. You got his rods. You'd better go and keep an eye on him. Sure. And you've got the nerve to think I'd let you marry my sister? Listen, Angie. I thought maybe we could wash it all out and start in again. I thought maybe you and me could get together. Get out of here. - Wait a minute. Let's talk this out. I don't want any trouble. I promised Joan I wouldn't. Why can't you see it our way? I love that kid and she loves me. I'm going to do everything I can for her. If I make her unhappy for even a second you can plug me. I won't raise a hand. That's just about your last speech. What's that? - Nothing. A backfire. A backfire. Give me that rod. Come on. I guess I should thank you but I don't. I had to do it, Lance. It was you or him. - Shut up. The Crossland Apartments. - That's where Angie lives. Yeah, I know. You can't go there. You'll get nicked sure. - I got to go. Can't you forget that dame and beat it? - No, I can't. Homicide Squad. Sergeant McRae. Yes? Hummingbird Club? Angie Morley dead? Riley. There's been a murder at the Hummingbird club. Send a squad. Calling car 172. Car 172 Go to the Hummingbird Club. I guess that about finishes everything. Oh Lance, why did you do it? I didn't do it. I don't suppose you believe that but that's not important for the moment. You must get out of here and stay out. I've done enough to you already. I won't see you dragged into any more dirt. I could have known it would turn out this way. I guess you've been playing with the wrong guy, but listen Joan. I love you. - Don't. Please. Whether you believe I killed Angie or not, I still love you. Enough to put you back into circulation. I want you to get out of here and forget all about me, will you. Oh, I don't know. I don't know. And try to forgive me. Please go, will you. Alright. Goodbye. [ Police siren ] [ Police siren ] Okay boys, let's go. Come on, McGowan. Slip me a couple of cigarettes, will you. Hiya, boy. How do you feel, Lance? I'll be out of here just as fast as my lawyer can see the right people. Listen, Lance. It isn't as easy as it used to be during prohibition. It's always easy if you know the ropes. Have you seen Joan? - No. Do you want me to? No. No, that's all washed up. Just help her get out of town if she wants to. A tough break, Lance. Forget it. I'll be having dinner with you tonight at 9 o'clock at Mindy's. How is the Babe? - That's what I wanted to tell you. He got bumped off hopping a freight. Bumped off? Gee. That means there won't be anybody to tell who did it but you. They won't believe you. Five minutes, McGowan. Hello Lance. - Hello. What kind of a mouthpiece are you? I'm here a week and you ain't done a thing about it. Well Lance, you've got to admit it's a pretty tough rap. What's tough about it? - $50,000 bail. Things aren't like they were, Lance. We had an election while you were away. Where's this pull you're meant to have? - But nobody will touch your bail. What's wrong with this town? Listen, my boy. You're water over the wheel. The administration is out to make a clean sweep. You happen to be the example. The newspapers will cheer. - And I'll burn. No, I hope not. - You and me both. What about self-defence? - Too risky. If they convince them you planted the gun, you're gone. Well, what else? - I don't know. That's a help. Just sit tight. I'll think of something. - Oh, you'll think of something? But times have changed, Lance. I didn't bump him off you know. Yeah, I know. But we've got to make a jury believe that. You're my attorney. At least you can believe it. Oh I do, my boy. I do. Isn't there someone you can get to? I've made the rounds. There isn't a soul that will even discuss it. But I'm still trying. Listen, Wilson. Do you realize I've not been in here more than 24 hours before? Get going. Marty, you've never refused me before. What's the idea? Fifty grand is too much. Besides, I hear they are going to give him the smooth end of the stick. Uhuh. I don't want any part of it. But you can speak to the D.A. can't you? Not on this. The word is out to keep hands off. Reformers are in the saddle and they're out to clean up the town. Sorry Wilson, can't do a thing. I've been all over town. The answer is just the same. There's nothing doing. Well, I spoke to the editor and he said he wouldn't touch it. They got to support the new administration. It looks like your boyfriend is going to be the horrible example. Do you recognise the defendant? Yes. He is Lance McGowan. When did you see the defendant last? - Tuesday night. March 10th. What time? - About midnight. Where? In the lounge of the Hummingbird Club. Did he speak to you? - Yep. Tell the court what transpired between you. Well, Lance came in and asked if Angie was in his office. I said yes and then Lance beat it into the office. Had you previously seen Angie Morley enter the office? I object. That's a leading question, Your Honor. - Overruled. Proceed. Sure. He came in about ten minutes ahead of Lance. Was he alone? Yep. - How do you know? I looked in to speak to him. What tone did the defendant use when he spoke to you? Well, he seemed nervous. Lance and Angie were always fighting. They had quarrelled before? - Yes. The night before Angie was shot. Then what happened? I was at the club. Lance was out on the balcony with Angie's sister. He was making a play for her. Angie got sore and went out to get her. I didn't get the low-down on what happened on the balcony. But in a minute, Angie came back and took his kid sister home. Then McGowan and Morley weren't exactly friends? Is that it? Well, Lance and Angie are sore at each other on account of .. Lance knocked off that crap game like I was telling you. Angie warned him about it. What are the odds? Senator. The kid will give you 500 to a 100 he gets life. I'll take it. - Check. We heard shots and beat it out of the lounge. Lance was coming downstairs with a rod in his hand. Well, we don't want any truck with Lance when he's rodded, so we lets him go. You mean he had a revolver in his hand? Yes. Sure. What was the exact time that the defendant left the office? Just 12 o'clock. - How do you know? The band had started on the air. And that's the time they go on. - You heard the band? When he had that rod on us, they had just finished their theme song. I'm paying you ten grand. Do something. This trial is kind of important to me. Well, I'm doing everything I can. Look at that jury. There is as much sympathy in those pans as there is in a pile of bricks. Senator. The kid says he'll give you 3-1 he gets the electric chair. For another hundred. I'll take it. - Check. Well, it was just 12 o'clock when Lance came downstairs. Was the revolver in his hand? I object. - Overruled. Yeah, he had a gun. - Then what happened? Then he scrams. - He left? Yeah. Your witness. Did you have a gun in your hand too when Lance came out? I object. - Sustained. I accept. Could you identify the gun you say Lance had in his hand? No. Then you don't know that the gun had ever been fired, do you? Well, Angie was upstairs dead with slugs in him and Lance with a gun in his hand. That is all. The people rest, Your Honor. Your Honor. Each and every witness that the prosecution has introduced .. Either has a criminal record .. Or he is known to be a person of bad morals. The prosecution has failed to prove a case. I move that this case be dismissed. Motion is denied. Proceed with your case. I say, isn't that Abigail Ardsley? - It is unless I've just lost my mind. Say, you. Get to the phone and hold the line open. Get ready. She's to testify that Lance McGowan was in her house. On March 10th at 12 o'clock. What? Miss Ardsley, will you please take the stand. Raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, so help you God? I do. - State your name. - Abigail Ardsley. Take the stand, please. Good morning, Chester. Good morning. Yes. She's going to be a witness. Abigail Ardsley. Holy cow! Mademoiselle of Armenti?res. She hasn't been out in forty years. Miss Ardsley. I'm going to ask you just two or three questions. Will you kindly look at the defendant. Do you recognise the defendant? Yes .. it is Mr McGowan. When did you see him last? He called at my house at .. Let me see. The night of March 10th. Did you notice and do you now recall the hour the defendant left your house? Yes, I did happen to notice. There is a large grandfather clock in my living room. It was just 12 o'clock when he left. Exactly 12 o'clock. Thank you, Miss Ardsley. Do you want to question the witness? No questions. Your Honor. In view of Miss Ardsley's testimony. And the fact that the prosecution has failed to prove a case .. I move that this case be dismissed. Case is dismissed. Just a moment. Let's collect our little bets. There you are, Senator. Skippy. Skippy. Look what I've brought you. I came to tell you I've got a job. I'm making a clean start. Splendid. I don't know how to say it. But I must get over to you how grateful I am. Let's say nothing more about it, Lance. Except that you've been rather inconsiderate. Me, how? In your troubles, it seems you've almost entirely forgot the girl who loved you. No, listen, sweetheart. I mean, Miss Ardsley. I didn't forget her. But I doubt she wants to see me with guys figuring I bumped off her brother. But you didn't. She don't believe that. Why don't you tell her? Joan, you don't think that I .. - I know you didn't. Thanks for everything. I'm only sorry that you had to lie for me. But I didn't. But you said in court .. - I know. That clock did indicate 12 o'clock when you left. When Robert died in my arms, I stopped all the clocks. So, for forty-five years .. It has always been m?dnight in this house. Gee. The moonlight is beautiful in the garden. I know. # s d o?o
