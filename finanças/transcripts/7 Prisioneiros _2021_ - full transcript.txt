Here. - That's enough. - A little bit more. I'm not that hungry. - They're hiding. - No, they're running. They're running from you. Prrr! Huh! Huh! Well, hey there! Ha! - What's up, Mateus? - Gilson. - Ready, man? - Ready. Fantastic. - This is my mom and my sisters. Gilson. - Mrs. Ana, pleasure to meet you. - Mateus speaks fondly of you. - Nice to meet you. I'll have to come by sometime for coffee. - Of course. - You'll see how things can change. Thank the Lord, my mother's never had to work a field ever again. Oh, here. This is for you, Mrs. Ana. To show you how things are going to be better. This is just the beginning, okay? Please, take this, Mrs. Ana. Your boy is going to make you proud. - Ready, Mateus? We're running late. - Let's go. São Paulo waits for no man. - Go in. - What's up? Hey. Bye. How's Julia? She must be going crazy, man. You know. She's blowing up my phone already. But I won't be gone for long. I'm gonna make enough cash to build us a nice place here. - You're nuts. - Ain't a woman holding me back. I'm never gonna come back to this place anymore. Family is everything to me. They're here. All the money is going to them. What you can't do is miss the opportunity to get out of here. To get rich and prosper. Look at me. I go to the barber shop once a week. - That's nice. - Get some nice cologne... I'm ugly, I have to do something to get the ladies. Sit tight, boys. It's five hours to São Paulo. Samuel. Welcome to the big city, boys. Ha, ha! I've never seen so many cars. São Paulo is pretty cool, huh? Whoa! Buildings as far as the eye can see! Hey, Mr. Luca! How have you been? I can't complain. These are the boys. They're eager to get working. Did you have a good trip? This is Samuel. Ezequiel. - Isaque and Mateus. - Hi. Nice to meet you. - Where are you guys from? - They're all from Catanduva. You worked the fields? - We do a bit of everything. - There are no slackers here. Good. Anything else, Mr. Luca? - That'll be all, Gilson. Thanks. - Cool. I better go. Busy day. - Be well, boys. - Thanks, Gilson. Come. Lunchroom's over there. This is the workshop. This is all scrap metal. Leave your things on the beds. I need your documents. Did you bring IDs? May I ask why. Mr. Luca? For the paperwork. Here, Mr. Luca. - Thanks. - Here, Mr. Luca. Mr. Luca, what about our contracts? We'll look into it this week. Uh, Mr. Luca, with all due respect, we're here for honest work with proper contracts. I'll speak with HR. For tomorrow, we have to finish seven deliveries. - We start at 5:00 a.m. - Yes, sir. Mr. Luca, what about dinner? Gilson said that every day we get three meals. They have great food at the corner bar. Here, 20 bucks. - We begin early. - You bet, Mr. Luca. We'll be ready. Check those tall-ass buildings. I'm definitely gonna get a condo here. - I call dibs on that one. I bought it. - I'd get sick being that high. I wanna be so high up people look like ants, you know? I liked that one there. - Wow. - Looks beautiful. - It all looks good. - You ready or do you need a second? - Not yet. - Thanks. Holler when you're ready. I... I want a big steak. That looks good. - What's it come with? - It's written here. This one. Steak sounds good. Let's order two meals and then split it? Whatever, I came here to eat, not to read. Hey, here. Two steak specials, please. Two steak specials it is. Coming right up. Did you see enrollment for night school started? - Maybe when I get back. - Did you graduate? I finished eight grade. Didn't you have anything better to do than study? My choices were farm work or farm work. I met this guy there. - Worked our asses off. - Really? We worked? Or did it take forever to do anything because you wouldn't shut up? Oh wait, I never shut up? - You were yapping all day. - Ooh. So how is your "Princess Mattress", huh? - Sure beats the one at home. - I've never slept in a bed. - Where did you? - Hammock. - I hate hammocks. - I don't like them either. Bed's way better. - Do you live with your parents? - With Grandma. And Mr. Reginaldo. I'm working for him. - Where are you from? - Like, far away. How old are you? You don't know how old you are? You're for real a hick, man. Am I right? What kind of magazine is that? Uh, aviation. Must be nice being able to read. Ever thought about going to college? College... You think I'll die in this junkyard? - College ain't for us. - For you. Look, we just got a half ton of copper wire. This is to be peeled. So, pay attention. Hold it tight... Like this. Remove all the rubber casing. Pure copper. We make a ton of money from this. Copper goes here, rubber in there. Let's sort the stainless steel. Over here. Take the magnet. It didn't stick? It's worth more. Toss it in here. Hard to understand? - No, sir. - Let's get to work? - Ready, let's do it. - Yup. Split up and pick a task. Hurry up. First truck is on the way. Come unload the truck. After that, you can load the ones you've already sorted. Hi, Mom. - Hi. Did you get there okay? - Yes, I made it safe, thanks. - How do you like it so far? - It's a big junkyard, that's for sure. - Lots of work for us. - No, I mean the city. Oh, I haven't gone out yet. We might do something next week. Well, you must be tired. I miss you, son and... YOUR CREDIT IS OVER PRESS 1 TO RECHARGE All right. Sort all of it. Let's go. Let's strip the cars down. It's been over a week without pay. If he gets paid, we should too. If I was gonna work for free, I'd have stayed. I didn't come here for nothing. Don't get all worked up. If we do our jobs, we'll get paid. I understand. I'm on it. Yes, sir. Hey. We've got two more deliveries today. Hurry up. Our lunch break isn't over, Mr. Luca. Oh yeah? The work isn't either. We're behind. What do we do? We made over 30 deliveries this week with no pay. Forgive me but I'm gonna finish my lunch. We really appreciate the work, but we... When we agreed to come, Gilson said we'd get paid per delivery. - We work overtime with no pay. - You haven't been paid? Really? Who paid the advance to your families? Who's paying the rent for your room? The food, transportation, all your expenses? You think that's cheap? You will be paid. Once you work off what's owed. - I'm taking it from your pay until then. - No one mentioned any debts. Not my problem, is it? Then fuck yourself and your debts! Nando. Son of a bitch! Easy, Nando. He understands. You're lucky I keep track of everything. Just work and pay it off. Give me your cell. - Now, fucker. - Let's go. Don't have one. Give it to me. I'll keep them as collateral. 1,000 in advance for each of us. 5,000 for recruiter's fees. 3,000 per month for lodging. 2,000 for transportation to here. 700 a month for food. 200 a month for equipment and tools. He even counted the 20 he gave us the first day. That fucking thief and son of a bitch! If he spent that on us, then we have to pay. You think this shithole is worth 3,000 a month? Three thousand gets you a mansion back home. I won't run away from my debts. It's more than we make. We're telling the police. I can't. Come on, Ezequiel. I ain't going back without money for Mr. Reginaldo. Don't go back there, then. Come stay with me. Let's go. Pack your things. It's locked. I'll check the back gate. Did you lose something, kid? Where's the key, motherfucker? Going for a stroll? Let me make this perfectly clear. You got a free ride here. I did you all a favor, and now you owe me. What do you do with a debt? Hmm? - You pay it. - Pay it. Back to the fucking dorm. There's work tomorrow. Move it! Motherfucker! How could Gilson do us like this? - He didn't know. - Yes, he did. He said he knew them and everything was fine. - I'll kill that piece of shit. - We have to get out of here. Let's fuck'em up. When Luca comes in tomorrow, we'll jump his ass. He'll expect that. We'll do it when the gate is open. - When the delivery truck arrives. - He's got a gun. Can we do something that'll distract him? Enough of this bullshit. Let's jump him in the morning. This guy knows what he's doing, Isaque. We have to be smarter than that. Mr. Luca! Samuel! Samuel! He's right here, Mr. Luca! Call an ambulance. He's dying. Samuel! You're fucking kidding me. Go get some water. Stop! Hey, stop! Stop, dammit! Get back! Get back inside! Are you crazy? One of them got away, Mr. Luca. Back in Ariranha, there's an isolated house on the edge of the town. It belongs to Mrs. Ana. She lives there with her three children. Odete, Cirlene, and you, Mateus. And Samuel. Your family lives in an elevated house, right by Mr. Geraldo's farm. You're in house number two, right by the highway. Do you know what I hate the most about the countryside? The smallest things make the news. I don't want anyone's mother making the headlines. If you so much as look at Mr. Luca, we'll pay your families a visit. Toothpaste! Your idea, right? Against the wall! Now! Move it! - Spread your legs! - You want to act like animals? We'll treat you like animals. No more showers. No toothpaste. No dinner. What's wrong? Wanna eat? You have to earn it. Instead of trying to run away! Do your fucking job and get the deliveries done. - How we're doing? - We're late. - How late? - Six deliveries behind, Mr. Luca. Let's get to work! Yes. "Yes, Mr. Luca." "Thank you, Mr. Luca." "Please, Mr. Luca." Show some respect, dammit! Yes, Mr. Luca. You guys have a good day. Let's go! Move! Faster! Move it, fuckers! Hurry up! Hold up! Hold up, stop! Help! Over here! Help! Go ahead. Scream all you want. No one will hear you. And if they do, my friends will be sure to pay your families a visit. Now get to work. Go on! Move it! Let's go. - Shut up, you fucking dumbass. - Stop it, Isaque. That hick's gonna fuck everything up. Stop whining, pussy or I'll bash your face in! Leave him be. You missed his head because this moron chickened out. If it wasn't for him, Luca would have been fucked up real good. You better watch your back, you hick motherfucker. Idiot! What the fuck, Isaque? - You're gonna back that loser? - Do you want to fuck everything up, man? Who did it? Alright, you'll make up for this shit. You're all doing overtime. Easy, man. I have to clean it. I didn't mean to screw it up. Are you missing your grandmother? Yeah. How about Mr. Reginaldo? Only my grandma likes me. Do you think she'll come here? ♪ Sakafunã, Sakafunã ♪ ♪ And Omolu, how handsome, handsome ♪ ♪ My friend, Sakafunã ♪ ♪ Sakafunã, Sakafunã ♪ ♪ And Omolu, how handsome, handsome ♪ ♪ My friend, Sakafunã ♪ Lord Omolu, for the living and the dead, please, Lord, allow no evil to enter his body.

You guys taking a break? Back to work! Move! Move it, boys! Goddammit. Hey, are you bailing on me? You got this. Good luck. Look at these. I'll be faster without you. I'm stressing thinking about someone hurting my family. Luca best be far away when my wife finds out. She'll come guns blazing. Julia's badass. She's the one. I wanna have three kids with her. They better take after her. If they take after their dad, they're screwed. For you. We had a good week. We need to shower, Mr. Luca. Go then. You're going or not? Let's slash his ass and bust out of here. You know what happens if we do that. If he's dead, then our families are safe. - He's not in this alone. - We're not alone. It's four against one. Right? Bunch of pawn bitches. I'll do it myself. - You'll kill him yourself. - Yeah. And you can get out without help. What happens next? What's your plan? You don't think they'll come for your family? Your mother, your sister? - Don't talk about my sister! - You don't have a plan but I do! Let's make a deal with him. To save ourselves and save our families. I ain't making any deals. You're all selling out for a shower. You're all cowards. I can improve production. And you won't have any more problems with us. I can make you more money, sir. Yeah? I want eight deliveries a day. I can get you more. We'll pay our debt in six months. Ten deliveries... six months... If any of your pals blow this, it's your ass on the line. Go tell them. Fuck that shit! In six months we'll be dead! You won't ruin the only good thing I got for us. Do your job. If not, I'll fuck you up. We've got ten deliveries. Let's go! Now, fucker! Go, Isaque. Split up so we can work faster. Let's go. Hurry up, guys. Let's finish early to get out of here faster. Twenty-seven. It's all there. - Already? - We're running ahead. When you're done, strip the doors. Mateus. Yeah, I'm looking at the fucking contract. I see it. Yeah. In theory, everything works. Hmm. Ah, fuck their inspection, okay? Not worth it for 800 grand. Yeah. Fine. Go to Shirley's. Get me some smokes. So, if you're missing home and want to see your mother, then go. Just have her make a pot of coffee for when I arrive. Ma'am. Yeah? A pack of cigarettes, please. No, the ones with the red filter. Okay. Hang on a sec. Here. It's on the house. And tell Luca that if he needs anything, he can count on us. All right? I'm fine, thanks. Mr. Luca? It'd be better to write, "During the agreed time, the company will distribute." Instead of, "there, in this time, the company could distribute." Then fix it. Go ahead. - Are you reading my contract? - No, Mr. Luca. - Think I can't write? - No, sir, I just glanced at it. Don't ever again read my fucking contract. What day is it? The 22nd or 23rd. Maybe. The 23rd is my third anniversary with Julia. - Congratulations. - Three years. You here while she's fucking around. Your mom is. I hear she fucks everybody, yo. She sucks on bartenders to get free drinks. You keep on yapping about family, but just like me, you were were sold. An advance? That's what they said, right? You are all sold, like little assholes. You think that's true? My mom wanted me to stay. Come on, think your mom would do that to you, Samuel? Not a chance. Stop with the nonsense. Pass it. I've got this. Go, Isaque. You're gonna try to play big? Over here, Samuel. Pass it, bro. Come on. Whoa, baby. Go, Nando. Go, go! - Goal! - Hey, come back. Now! Back away. Nice try. Goal! What? When? Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop it. Get in the van! No, go, go, go! Into the van, dammit. Drive around. I'll call you. With me. Look, some people are coming. They'll ask a shitload of questions. You'll tell them things run by the book here. - Are we clear? - Yeah, Mr. Luca. Come on. INSPECTION - Good afternoon. - Afternoon. Is a Mr. Luiz Carlos de Almeida here? - Who wants to know? - Labor Prosecutor's office. - Is there a problem? - It's routine. - Oliveira, let's start with the staff. - Okay. Come here, buddy. This is Mateus. - Hello. - Good afternoon, Mateus. - Good afternoon. - So, do you work here? - Yes, sir. - How long have you been working here? - Uh, about six weeks. - Mm-hmm. - Can I see your employment card? - Mr. Luca has it... Documents are on the office there. You know you have to keep those documents with you, right? - Yes, ma'am. - How many staff? - They're four. - And where are they now? They're gone, making a delivery. - Do they all sleep here? - Yup. - There. - I'd like to see it, please. Of course. About how many hours do you work, Mateus? - Eight. - That was a question for Mateus. - I work eight hours. - How often do you work overtime? We never work overtime. Pretty filthy in here. You're right. It needs to be cleaned. This mattress... is disgusting. This is degrading. We asked him not to replace it, to give us the cash instead because it really helps back home. Can I get you a coffee? No, I appreciate it. Did you bring an umbrella? It's supposed to rain later this afternoon. Thanks, but we'll be fine. We drove here. - When it starts raining, we move inside. - Really? Yes. Thank God we have a lot of work to do. That's good. Thank you. Hey, boss. Gum? No, thanks. Thanks. Any issues? Eh, it's missing some paperwork, but... What do you mean you didn't tell them? He was by my side every second. There was no way. They weren't strapped. He was. You don't know what I went through. What about us, locked in a fucking van? Two hours, we don't know where we were, if we're gonna live or die. Huh? I do as I'm told, like everyone else. That were me, we'd be out of here. Then do it. You're a big shot? So you wanna kill? Then go kill. Kill Luca, kill Nando, kill the lady from the bar. The police officers. But you have to kill them all. So? Who'll be the first? Okay. Marked it off. Take it away. Go on! Look alive, let's go. Take a shower. We're going out. Let's go! Psst. Aren't you forgetting something? Hurry up! Come on. - Hey, Luca. - You good? All good, yeah. Okay. De pie. Vamos. ¡Vamos! These here are Bolivians. Haitian. Venezuelan. They're all healthy. You wanted strong men, right? Mm? Pick three of them. It's up to you. - Those three. - Okay. ¡Viene, viene, viene! ¡Vamos, vamos! ¡Vamos, vamos, vamos! Let's go. Right this way. This way. S'il vous plaît, Monsieur. You shut up, boy. Here are their passports. Let's go. There, yes. What's up, Luca? All good. Holy shit. You guys aren't messing around. How we're doing? Two thousand pieces a day. - So, what can I do for you? - Well... - looking for... - Fine. I thought you were gonna call me. Let me see what I've got. Right this way. They're here. Wake up. You two, come on. Get up. Come on. Back. Get up and grab your things. Let's go. You two, go. Up. On your feet. You two. Go. Hurry. Move. Go! Help! Help! Help! Go get him! Get him over here. Come here. Watch this. If you try to run away, the police will kill you. If you try to run away, the police will kill you. Now he understands. Luca, always great to see you. - Let's go. - You're a good kid, you know that? Real good. Take them in. Ten grand each. Don't fuck around. Don't let me see you again without that money. Who's this? Where is he? Where's Luca? He's in the van. Come. On the ground. Stay. Where's the money? Tell him to come and get it. I know he wants it. If Luca wants it, he can get it himself. Now get lost, kid. They're ten grand each. I need the money. Are you fucking crazy? You wanna die today, bitch? Are you insane? Take him out. Now! Fucking crazy little shit He's telling me to shoot you. You wanna die here, fucker? Go ahead. Luca will shoot me if I come back empty handed. And he'll kill all of you. You hear me? Luca will kill the both of us. Tell Luca to go fuck himself, little shit! Huh? Get out, boy! Show some fucking respect! Get out, now! Beat it! Yeah, I'm listening. Okay. Who's gonna pay? Who pays for that? Huh? Come on. I said I'm alright. All right. - Yeah. - Mr. Luca. What's your cut? Name it. Give me half. Ten grand? Most of this goes to my boss. - Five-hundred. - A grand. How did they get here? By plane, bus, shipping containers. Like everything else we buy. And how many? Enough to keep everything running. Do you see that? All that copper wire is from us. Your work powers the whole city. Get out. Drag him out of there. Sir, please, don't hurt him. He's just scared. Go. You're sleeping in here now. I don't need to. He'll stab you in the eye while you're sleeping. I know what I'm talking about. How long have you been doing this? Long enough. Has anyone escaped? Not from me. Let's see how you handle it. Mr. Luca, I appreciate all you've done for me, but I can't. And why not? Because I won't. I won't keep them caged or hurt them. All right. Go in there, then. Go. Go join your buddies. I'll find someone else to do it. How can you justify doing this? Same way you do. I'm not doing this because I want to. We have a deal. After that, I'm free. You're free? To do what? Free to starve? Till your family suffer? I saw your magazines. You want to be a pilot? - An engineer. - Nice. That's a fine profession. I wanted to be that once. So why don't you do something else? I came from a shithole like you, kid. Raised in a shack next to an open sewer. My mother worked herself sick to raise four of us. On her own. And her boss, he was a really nice guy. Treated us like family. Except he made her work 12 hours every day for 600 a month. The shoes that fucker wore cost more than that. Is that the freedom you want? There's the door. Go be free. I wondered if you'd show up. You're here to let us out, bro? Open the fucking door! You choosing them now? Which is it? Yes, he brought me here. You're so badass now, huh? - Do you even know how to shoot? - Back up, Isaque. Come here, Samuel. He's right over there. Make sure they're cool. I'm doing everything I can to get us out of here. Out. Open the door and come out. Come on. Pick up the pace. That's pure copper. Copper goes here, rubber there. Got it? It's not my job to move all this shit, it's yours. Better move your asses now. Do you guys need anything? Yo, Isaque was right about you. I didn't ask for this. What am I supposed to say? That I won't do it? Yeah. You'd rather have that prick watching you? I'm still one of us. I can talk to your family. I can call your mom. Or Julia. - I gotta go talk to the others. - With who? Isaque? Forget that asshole. He'll make things worse. We're from the same town. Yeah, bro. What of our deal? I can get us out of here earlier. You'll need this. I added my number, plus Nando's and Batista's. And you can call your mom now. Go ahead. - Hello? - Mom? Mateus? Where are you? I've been calling you but you never answer. This is my new number, Mom. I should have told you. How can you disappear on me like that? You just send money but you never call. What money, Mom? The money you sent me, honey. But how did you make so much? Uh, I've just been working more hours. And the other boys? How are they? - They're fine, thank God. - Call more often. We all miss you so much. I will, Mom. - Bye. - Call me soon. I sent her four grand. Your cut, kid. And it's just the beginning. Fuck yeah. - Drink up. - I think this calls for a whiskey. - Fun days. - Look. - Hey! - Oh, I'm sorry, sir. - Do you make him call you "sir"? - That a problem? Is that how you talk to people? You have control him, you see? Understood. Will do. What do you do back in the country to pass the time? - Give me a smoke. - Here you go. I wanna see this. Here. He smokes, huh? I'll have a beer, please. Come with me! I'll be right back. So, you should bring your mom to meet her daughter-in-law. - My mom wouldn't get used to São Paulo. - Really? - Are you gonna leave her there? - She'll want to stay. But working so hard is going to kill her. - I don't know how she does it. - And your dad? What dad? When I have kids, I'll be a father to them. Do you want kids? Four. Two girls, two boys. So you'll take care of your mom, kids, and everything else. Get us some beers, will you? Mr. Luca... Mr. Luca? Mr. Luca? Eat it before he sees it. Did you have fun tonight? So where's Luca? Now you go in and out whenever you want? Where the fuck is Luca? Answer me, asshole! Right there. - In his office. - That asshole is out cold, yo. You walked out of here as a free man and came back as a free man. Is what he said true? Tell us, Mateus. Hurry up and eat. We have deliveries. Hurry. Okay. - Sing something. - Go, Samuel. BIANCHI = FUTURE Luca, my man. Hey. Need to take a look. Okay. Spread your legs. - Excuse me. - Oh, look who it is. - How are you? - Hello there, Luca. - You've been good? - Yes, very good. A gift for your daughter, Mr. Bianchi. You shouldn't have. Thank you. - Take this for me. Sit down. - Thank you. Get Rodiney over here. Here's the deal. I have to focus on my campaign. I'll give you the keys to the office. You're leaving the junkyard. I need you on the front lines of the business. It entails making the daily rounds, checking productivity, overseeing the work schedule. Then reporting back to me. Consider it done. Mm? There he is. Rodiney. He will take over the junkyard. Cool. - It's a hard business. - Hmm. All right, now go and enjoy yourself. - How's everything? - So great. - Very good. Who's this? - Hello there. The "Yellow Ribbon" song. Remember? You know it? - Let's hear it... - ♪ Yellow ribbon... ♪ Good times. Don't move. Stay there. Hey, what are you doing? - No one else here. - Mm-hmm. Got you. Now go play with your friends. Go play hide and seek with Cida. Kids... - Is that your daughter? - Mm, yeah. - You like kids? - Yes, I do, sir. I got into politics because of them. I want to leave them a better country. - You're with Luca, right? - I am, yes. - How long have you known each other? - Hmm. My father had businesses in Itaquera. I ended up inheriting everything after he passed and I needed a personal assistant to grab me me food, you know? I took one look at this guy and immediately saw he stood out. All I had to do was whistle, like this... He's been with me ever since. Do those people we bought work for him? Any of them get the deal we got? You got lucky, buddy. I'm talking about the other guys. There's no deal? Are they free when the debt is paid? Next week, the junkyard is behind me. If you wanna move up, I have a job for you. Or you stay there. Your choice. Thank you. You look at this beard. It's getting grayer by the minute. And who is this? He works with me. Mateus. - He's so young. - Not as young as you, ma'am. - Pleasure to meet you. - Oh, he's a smooth talker. - No need to call me ma'am. - I wanna use the restroom. Your brother and sisters are coming. This is a miracle to have him here. It's hard on me. He's always working. But once in a purple, he shows up out of nowhere. The famous lady killer, huh? - Well, look who's coming. - Good afternoon. Well, hello. - Oh, yeah! - Please enjoy. No, no. I taught you better than that now. Guests first. You go. You're about to eat the best coxinha ever. This keeps the doors open. Enjoy. All right! Did I lie? He keeps this running. He got the bakery and gifted it to me. How many mothers can say that? Hey. How are things with Ana? Tell him, honey. She doesn't want to have kids. Just let him be, Mom. Let's not get into it, please. - It's not my fault but... - Plenty of grandkids to look after. - Yeah? Plenty of grandkids? - Yeah. Where are they then? Bring them to me. - Are they're hiding? - Around. I'll check there. Moms say this 'cause we want the best for our kids. The best for all of them. Really. Doesn't your mother? See? What does she do? Farmwork, mostly. Me too, for far too many years. - Are you from the countryside? - No, no. We lived just outside of Rio, in the middle of nowhere. A dump by the sewer. We moved to São Paulo when Luca was becoming a man. He was maybe 13 or 14. Did you worry about him a lot back then? No, not my Luca, no. My Luca was afraid of nothing. He would steal the boss's horses... ...and he would gallop away in the dead of night to sell away his chickens but he's never tried to lie to me. Never. He would always bring the money home. He's my pride and joy. Mm-hmm. A born leader. You should follow his every word. Keep him close and you'll go far. Hmm? You were a hick? That's not what I... No, please, I didn't say you were a hick, I promise. - One beer and you're already tipsy. - No, he was joking... - I didn't say it. I didn't. - Oh, really? Oh, so nice! Next week's shipment is copper, wire and stainless steel. - Sounds good. - I'll put you down for it. Shit. Get him, get him! - Keep them back! - Come on! - Luca! - What are you doing? After him! Luca! Get him! Call Batista. We gotta do something about him. Teach him a lesson. That's not necessary. It's us or them. Call him. - Who is this? - Mateus. - What do you want? - We had a worker trying to escape. Who? Samuel. What should I do? Go to his house. Send a permanent message? No. Just give them a scare. TELL SAMUEL HIS MOTHER SAYS HI Say "Portuguese". "Portuguese." I never wanted this. The truck comes five times a day. We're making 15 deliveries. Probably more. Which one here tried to escape? That one. Weren't they seven? No. That's all of them. Tuesdays and Thursdays get busy. You gotta do inventory. Take your lunch break. Got a cigarette? Can you give me a light? Thanks. See you. - Got everything? - Yeah, all set.
