Night Baby Moon On this day, space travel has become a real possibility. Sputnik means Baby Moon in Russian, and this name resounds like a promise. Soon, atomic propulsion rockets will bring back photos of the dark side of the moon. Then, will come the moment when man sets foot on the planet of which poets have long dreamed. Tens of millions of solar batteries made of lunar sand will produce energy. Do you want me to stop, Grandma? The moon makes so many things move. The sea... sap... blood... It affects my pulse. What's your pulse? Do you want to feel it? Give me your hand. Come on dear, you have to go home and let Great Gran sleep. Put a little perfume on the pillow. Today, 107 men were killed in an aerial attack. A total of 650 rebels were neutralised in the last 3 days. This is the estimation of enemy losses. Rocket launchers were seized as well as machine guns. The quality and quantity of these weapons explain the considerable means used on the French side. Don't be afraid. I'm here. Why? Grandma, I want to go now. Only fools never change their mind. Catch up with them! Go on! Will you come back or sleep at home? I'll come back. Let's go! Lights off! It upsets me when you don't tell the truth. You never liked fireworks. You didn't go for that. You went back to see that beast. How do you know? You smell of rot! Now listen to me. Don't go back again. You'll catch a disease! In the cemetery can you catch diseases too? Don't be silly! You know, you can make candles from a whale. How do you mean, candles? Look! Material extracted from the head is used in candle-making. You see, nature is well-made. That way, nothing is wasted. Why do you light candles when someone dies? I don't know, dear. It's always been like that. But why, Grandma? Because it's pretty. Because it's comforting. Don't you feel those tiny flames are alive? I've seen so many people die. Believe me... Life is much bigger than us. We are just passing through. But why? Do you like it? Remember this forever. This is the loveliest music in the world. If you go South you get to Cape Creus lighthouse. That one goes: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven... light. One, two... light. Here is the Cape of Sant Sebastia. It flashes every five seconds. Like this! One, two, three, four, five... flash. One, two, three, four, five... another flash. I know how our one goes. And how does it go? Light! Light! Light! That's right! Look! Since we're here and you know so many things... Explain to them how the Sputnik flies. I couldn't explain it myself. What do you want to know? How does it fly with no one in it? Look, it's the same as the moon. It moves around us and it doesn't fall. But why? Do you know what this is? Yes. Everything metal sticks to it. It's the same for all things. There are forces we cannot see, but they do exist. A Decision A Decision The plants were thirsty. We went to water them. We took the old road. Then we cut across the reeds. The big gate was closed. Dad let me open the small one. It was as hard as stone. I've never seen water move so fast. On the way back, we met Mr Palat. - Coming back from the garden? - Yes. - Did you water it a bit? - Yes. It was really dry. Did you help your Dad? He always does. He talked about Mum's health. How is she? Not very well. What did the doctor say? That it could come back. He asked Dad if they'd decided. Dad said, "It's difficult." Mr Palat said, "Do it!" "You have to stop. The work will kill you." Speaking of work... I have to go. Goodbye. Hello Josep! Go on. Go home. I asked Dad if we're going to live in another country. Boys! Coming! What did he say? He said, "Mum and I are thinking about it." Now listen to me! I've got a plan. Homework done? Not yet. Do it and I'll eat with you. Dad said you mustn't get up. I'll be alright now. It's almost over. Are we going to another country? Who told you that? Dad. The cheek of you! Dad never said any such thing. Go on and be good! We're not going there. Dad's going to be a nurse. Is he going back to school? The army's going to pay for his studies. Dad's going to be a soldier. Goodbye. It's my turn now. What's he up to? - Can we throw streamers? - Yes. Are you sure you found her here? Yes. I recognize the stones. You see, she's at home here. Another Country Go ahead. Come in. I'll show you around. - Is the water on? - Yes. Everything works. We've put up camp beds. OK? Fine. It's just for one night. Can we eat somewhere? There's a little restaurant not far. Our mess is closed but they're still serving. Are you coming or what? Good evening. Are you still serving? Yes. Come in. Sit down! Can they wash their hands? No problem. This way! There's soap and everything. Mum, Dad, come and see! Come on! Look! Have you never seen any? We don't have them at home. What are they, Dad? They're glow-worms but these ones fly. I'll show you! A Long Night Mum's been crying. A long night of waiting in Alger around the entrenched camp of the insurgents, despite the curfew now in operation from 7 pm. The generals are meeting to decide what to do. Small groups are gathering near the barricades. Are they the generals who command Dad? I don't know. Turn that back on! Do what I tell you! Mum, Dad's in the desert. He's not in Alger. Mum, do you want a blanket? I'll be alright. Put on your pyjamas and I'll be in. Can I look for something else? I can't figure out what's going on. Can we play a game? Not tonight, dear. I'm tired. Please! Let's play Little Horses. No, I've had enough of that. Let's play Mikado! One game and then bed. Everything's Fine Your father's waiting for you at the infirmary. Sit down. Dad, they've already done all the tests. Sit down! I want to see for myself. Please Dad, it's not necessary. Don't make me shout. I'm ashamed as it is. Everyone knows my son cracked his skull in class. Stay still! Tell me what's going on in your head? It was an accident. Things happen. The whole class was messing around. Now everything's fine. No, things are not fine. You insist on doing what's forbidden! You're always looking for trouble! You're always digging up shit! Dad, when you're over there... Well what, when I'm over there? Do you kill people? Who told you that? My classmates. What did you tell them? That you looked after the wounded. That's why you were fighting? Are you going back there again? Now listen carefully. If you want a different life, you have to read, study. Stop acting the fool! Do you get that? Your life is in your hands. Can I read for a while? Five minutes then lights out. Go to sleep now. Don't leave me alone. Get the matches from the kitchen. Go on, get them. Don't be afraid. I'm here.
