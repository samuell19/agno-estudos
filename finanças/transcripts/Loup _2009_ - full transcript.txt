In far north-eastern Siberia, in the Verkhoyansk mountains, I met the Eveny... a small nomadic tribe of reindeer breeders. Free men who have no material goods, yet who are immensely rich for they are skilled at living in harmony with nature. In clans of four to six families, they drive a large, half-wild herd of reindeer handed down through the generations over thousands of years. To the Eveny who revealed their incredible lifestyle to me, I dedicate my film. WOLF Serguei, don't move! Here, take it. My first memory of your father is the day he put this tunic on. He was barely 15. The sleeves came to his knees. It will fit you better. Come on, put it on. Stop dreaming now. Are you scared? No, I'm ok. I've been up there alone before. This is different, Serguei. I know you. Always daydreaming... Mum, I'm not a child anymore. You are, for five more minutes. Serguei, are you coming? My name is Nicolai, head of the Batagai clan, which roams the Kharanga mountain pastures. Today, I'm hunting mouflon. Our people always offer this meat at the first summer moon ceremony. During the feast, we designate the one who will keep the reindeer until winter. And my son, Serguei, has been chosen. Vladim, we need you. No one needs me. Stop it. Come on... Too bad my father isn't here anymore. It wouldn't change things. Serguei's a year older than you. He has to keep the herd. Who says he'll succeed? It'll be your turn next year. Come on! Serguei, the clan has chosen you to watch over our most precious asset, the great herd. We follow it. It gives us everything we need. Will you serve it? Yes. Defend it? Yes. I'm blind now so I'll give you my rifle, Serguei. It now becomes yours. May the spirit of our mountains be with you. Long live Serguei! You'll be ok? Put it in the bag, not on your back. I'd rather carry it. You never know. What are you afraid of? Nothing. Nothing. - You understood everything? - Yes, Dad. The herd is on the Jana plateau. You know it? Yes, don't worry. Get going then. Don't leave the herd alone too long. Those damn wolves are around. Off you go. That's good. That's Mouriak! Look, it's Mouriak! Hail, Moujouk, your spirit has guided our journeys. I'm glad to know you're here, Mouriak. These encounters must feed our two clans. Mouriak! Nicolai! Go on. Moujouk! Can you stay a while? Until the winter count. I'll take 20 of the large males. You've grown to be a pretty girl Naztazia. Your parents aren't here? No, they're with the herd, near Sebyan. We were getting worried. I thought we'd never get here. Is Serguei here? He's the herd-keeper now. Where is he? Up there, with the herd. Serguei was sorry that he had to miss you. Two years is a long time. - He must be taller than me now. - Almost. A real young man. Couldn't the young man come back sooner? What are you two plotting? I've brought a stove. The nights are cold. Tell me... Could Serguei come back sooner? No one's taking over for a week. Nicolai! I'm backing away, ok. I'll stay here, don't worry. You're beautiful. You're magnificent. I'll call you Voulka. Do you like it? Bye, Voulka! I'll leave you in peace while your cubs grow a bit. Who's that? We're here to replace you. - Your dad sent us. Mouriak's here. - You get a few days off. Right now? No, next summer! I want to move them. There's still lichen here. They're uneasy. They head towards the Ouchka. Nicolai is going to move the camp. You'll meet them in the valley. He wants to move to the Ouchaka to fish. You're not cold? Look, it's Serguei! Up there. Naztazia! Yes... Serguei. Look, Mum, Naztazia and Serguei have stopped. You've changed. So have you. Come on. Too bad I missed the ceremony. Will you show me? Stop it! Nicolai said we'd pitch camp on the Kalanka pasture by the river. We could go to the Pulka Pass. Do you remember? I won't have time. I must return to the herd. Nicolai is hunting tomorrow. He said you can wait until he returns. Isn't Vladim up there? I have to watch them, not Vladim. He can fill in for you. I can't stay, Naztazia. My place is there, understand? Yes, I understand. I understand all too well. Don't be upset. The herd up there is important. So go back up! Naztazia! Is it much further? Alexeiv, come and see! Hard to tell. It's not a wolverine. A wolf? It looks like it. We follow its tracks? They're not attacking the deer. We should find it though. Yeah. A dead wolf is better than a live one. Serguei, everything's going well up there? Yeah... Are you sure? Yes, nothing to report. Everything's fine. The lichen is good up there? Yes, but I'll bring them down. The lichen seems thicker. They keep heading there. Where's Naztazia? She's tired. Want to hunt tomorrow? No, I'm going back up. But Vladim can stay up there! - Naztazia asked... - I watch the herd. The rest is my business too. Alexeiv, don't go so far. There's wood right here. Already back? Where were you? Why didn't you take them to the Ouchka? We were busy. - We can do it now. - I don't need help. There's a wolf around here. You saw its tracks? - So what? - I'm not the herd-keeper... Enough! I know what I have to do! Who do you think you are? Watch your tone with me! Cut it out! Come on. All this is going to your head. - Hello. - Hello. Maybe you shouldn't go. He's weird. Weird? He's hiding something. I'd take the job more seriously. Is it far? His tent is down by the lake. Travel safely. Come on. Gently... Don't worry, it's all right. Come on, you pretty one. Come on. Come on. Come on, you. Come on... Yes, that's it... That's good, you're not scared. Gently... Gently... That's it Voulka. You can keep your cub. Just a second, Voulka, these aren't your tracks. Have you got a lover? You're the bravest one. A real chief. I'll call you Kamar. Come on. You're the shyest one. Come on, don't be afraid. Naztazia! You're sick! Totally sick, Serguei! This will surprise people. Don't tell anyone or I'll have had it. You'll lose everything! What's wrong with you? Why did you do it? I don't know, Naztazia. I couldn't kill them. You've nothing to say? - Where are you going? - To the camp. Stop! Look... You can't go now. There's a storm. You can't cross the pass. You'd be mad to go tonight. This won't change anything. You'd have done the same. You'd better find a solution. Serguei! There you are. And Naztazia? I'm here. We were worried about you. No one should have been out in that storm last night. It's good you're here together. This wood's good and dry. The weather's clearing up. How's it going with the herd? I'm managing. You're not sure? I'm fine, believe me. Vladim saw wolf tracks. Well? Yes, maybe there's one around here. Maybe one? One isn't enough? How come you didn't notice? - Vladim comes and... - I saw tracks but... You saw them, yes or no? Tell me! They keep away from the deer in summer. A good job they keep away from them! Wolves can attack from early autumn! What's going on? Don't worry, Nicolai, he's doing a good job. You can count on him. He even left me behind to join his herd. Right... I'm sorry, Naztazia. I should have told you right away. I was stupid. It's madness, Serguei. They'll never know about it. - How's it going over there? - Fine. And Naztazia? She's staying with Serguei. Good. I was starting to worry about her. Where else would she be? You seem a bit odd. No, I'm fine. They get along well in any case. So what's wrong? I don't know. Serguei is odd. Shifty. That's because Vladim told you about finding wolves. Since his father died, he'd invent anything to get your attention. I don't need Vladim to form an opinion. You should try trusting your son. Voulka! Voulka! I've brought someone. Voulka's your girlfriend? Stay here. Don't be afraid. Gently, Voulka. Gently. Kamar... Little Kitnic... And Baikal. Kitnic, are you ok? It's all right. You have to back away. She doesn't know you. - You understand wolves now? - I have to. You should move the camp. It's too close to the lair. We'll leave for a more open area. We'll move the herd and shift the tent. We? - This should do it. - It's no use. They'll eat the deer once winter's here. At least they'll follow us now. Why don't you explain everything to your father? Stop it, you don't know him. Last winter, they slaughtered 17 wolves. You didn't try to talk to him. Talking to him means handing our wolves over. You have no choice. Want us to kill them ourselves? Voulka! Come on, Voulka. Don't be scared. Come on. Come on, Voulka. Come closer. That's it... Come closer, Voulka. There... That's it. Go away! Go away! It's crazy how fast they grow. I saw them two days ago, on that hillside. I think they've settled there. They're not far from the herd but it's ok for now. Sure! That big male's starting to take an interest. Don't worry. The wolf's at the door! They're here? Wait. Stay here. Come on. Come over here. Come on. Yes, that's it. Who's he? Kamar, the bravest one. Say hello to Naztazia. Come on. He was the first to come to me. Where's Kitnic? Come over here. This is Voulka. It's ok, she won't hurt you. She's a little wary for now. Baikal! Come on, Baikal! Ever got close to him? 50 metres or so. He keeps away. He's mistrustful. He scares me. Think the snow will stay? Not in the lower valleys. But up here, yes. Know what it means? No. We'll corral the deer for winter, far from the wolves. And we'll be leaving soon. I want you to stay, Naztazia. You know what that means? Yes, I know. Are you sure? Naztazia, come and see! There are tracks everywhere! It's not just one wolf, it's a pack! A pack roaming here! No, just two or three. I'm not stupid! They won't attack the herd. They eat partridge. They eat partridge! Partridge! They devour our reindeer! We're leaving. So what? You think they can't follow? Pack your tent and come to the camp. Tomorrow, we gather the herd to go to the corral. Mouriak will help. We follow the valley? Yes. We'll go over the mountains with the herd. Is the corral far from the camp? 15 minutes or so. We'll join you after we finish. Serguei will stay to watch them. Hurry up! Don't waste any time! Let's go. Hurry up! Come on! Let's go! Get them in! Let's start sorting them. Who's guarding them? That's Serguei's job. The wolves followed us. You saw their tracks? We all did. Now the deer are here, Alexeiv and I could hunt them down. Yes. Go on. Head back to the camp after. I heard. I know what you're doing. I'm coming too. You stay here and guard the deer. We'll see to the wolves. Your father said so. We each have a job to do. Wait for me! Stop! We don't need you! Where are you going? No sense in looking together. We're going to Ouchnaka. Look somewhere else. I'll leave you. I'm going to the foot of the pass. Go on then! Voulka! No! Come back! - Well? - The tracks had been erased by the wind. Serguei joined us at the river. We split up. He headed for the pass. What? He isn't with the deer? He went back? I guess. He wouldn't leave them alone. Check he's at the corral. I'll go. I'll stay at the hut with him. It's what we planned. Isn't it odd that he went off alone? He's taunting me. I told him to stay. What if he's still out? We'd know by now. Naztazia would have come back. Are you ok? Where are your deer? Talk to me! - Did Vladim find them? - No. He's back. He found no tracks because of the wind. Who's watching the herd? We have to go! Serguei, look! They're wolves, Serguei! Wolves! I wish I could have changed things. Change nature? What do you want? Stop wolves eating deer so we wouldn't kill them? What planet do you live on? I can't hate them even now. Your family hates them? No, just as a wolf doesn't hate its prey. We're all fighting to survive. Accept that. We breed reindeer. I'm scared, Serguei. You lied to us, Serguei! From the beginning! What are you up to? What are you hiding, dammit? Vladim is right. You're too young to care for the herd. If you're not a man for us, how can you be one for a woman? Get the deer ready. Go with Andrei. This time, we'll get them. We'll follow every track to the wolves. I have to settle this. Me and no one else! I've heard that before. It's between them and me. Give me a chance. It's the last one. The very last. Take care. It was good to see you. Going via Rhandiga? I'll never go that way again. They've cut down everything. All the trees have gone. The autumn rain washed away the soil. Nothing's left. We'll try to stop them. I know I can count on you. I'll watch over Naztazia. Tell her parents. And you, take care of your son... Next summer, we'll visit them. Having regrets? It's not that! It's Serguei. He's been gone too long. He let us all down. You still count on him? I don't care what the clan thinks. Can't you see? All I want to know is where he is what he's doing, if he's well. A wolf. Serguei. Death. Death? The wolf. A wolf, death. A wolf? And Serguei? Serguei... Serguei? I don't know. Let's go! Good, good. Gently... Gently... Why did you do it? It was wrong. No! Not again! Stop! Baikal... Baikal, I didn't mean to do it. I didn't. Are you ok? You don't look too good. Alexeiv, see to the deer. I'll handle this. Look, Serguei isn't a child. He's used to this. He knows about storms. - He has no shelter. - He has to find his wolves! That's what matters. He has to prove himself. He broke our rules. - He thought... - Our rules? Our rules. Your rules that you want us all to follow. Not my rules, the clan's. The rules that govern our lives. And keep us alive. Nicolai, a chief has to be able to change. Your son may not be following the wrong path. You should find him. I have a bad feeling. Kamar, Anouska, Kitnic! Come on! Don't go, it's me! Come on! My beautiful Anouska... Handsome Kamar... Come on. It's me, look, I don't have a rifle. Anouska! Don't be afraid. It's me, Anouska. Come here, beauty. It's me. Come on. It's me, Kitnic. Don't be afraid. Voulka, it's me. Don't be afraid. Come to me. I saw smoke. I guessed it was you. Checking up on me? A wolf? - That's good. - The others are far ahead. I'm not checking on you. We were worried. I'll go and reassure your mother. I'll let you do what you have to do. Join me at Ozala Lake. We've moved the camp. You remember, we caught that huge trout there. You nearly fell in the hole. Don't be afraid. Yes, that's good. Come here. Give me warmth. You're kind. Come on. This warms me up. Come on. Careful, that's fire. No! Don't touch the deer! I said no! I said no! That's all over now. Kamar! Look at you! That's good! There. That's good, come on. Look, we're here. See that? All that land? You can hunt there. Anouska! Come on... Listen to me, Torok. You mustn't cross this river again. Don't follow me. You have to stay here. You have all you need here. I'll be back with Naztazia next summer. No! It's over. Go away! Go on! Go away! Stay there! That's good! That's it! Stay there! There... It's Serguei! Nicolai, it's Serguei! Serguei... Are you ok? Come on. Let him get warm. I'll see to the deer. It's madness what you did. How far did you go? Let him speak. Well? There were six of them. I killed that young wolf first. The others fled. I caught up but I couldn't get close to them. Ever. They were always ahead. It could have gone on for weeks. But in a valley they didn't know, I cornered them near a cliff. One wolf killed itself. A 100-metre fall. I saw to the others. They're dead. Got the skins? I ask the questions. They're in the ravine. Fetch them if you want. Look at this herd. I've seen it grow. I'm fond of it. And I hate it being attacked. You know, Serguei... Your wolves... I don't want to see them come back. The lichen is sprouting here. We'll move soon. Naztazia will join her clan before the wind moon. I'll go with her. Nicolai wants you. Catch deer for the feast. Coming. There. - Are you ok? - Yes. I don't know what secret you two share. And I don't want to know. But I hope it's a good secret. What's a good secret? One that causes no harm if others find out. Serguei and I are strong enough for that. It's a good one then. It's a secret. Your fiancee is beautiful. They must be big now. Kamar will be laying down the law. He wouldn't leave the deer alone. He kept biting them. And Anouska? Anouska and Kitnic? They're glued to their mother. We'll go to see them next summer. Will we take the same path? If the rivers are in flood, we'll take the high plateaux. Think they've stayed? I hope so. It's a good place. They have all they need. It's the same every year. We never kill them all. It will never end. Why should it? We share the mountains with the wolves. We tend to forget. The wolves aren't our problem. The men down in Maska are. They think this land is theirs. They'll destroy us. They won't come this far. They're building a road to Rhandiga. Mouriak told me. The land is devastated. But with a road, we know what happens. Nothing is left. Rhandiga is far away. It's far away but it will be close soon. Calm down. Really? Why? Because I could see them too. What are your 5 wolves called? Anouska and Kitnic? Is that it? - What did he say? - Nothing. I'll explain. Yeah, sure. Explain well. - Is he ok? - I don't know. It's just a slight sprain. I'll imprison the pain in clay. It's nothing. There. Serguei, warn the clan. A blizzard is coming. The one marking the end of winter. But the wind's not all I hear. That's not good. Not good at all. Listen. Take your rifle. Right... I'll head right with Serguei. Vladim, head left. Take three or four men with you. Take the sleigh. The others follow on foot, ok? There's no time to lose. No need to wait. You'll see them soon. But not in the same state. Well? I got one, maybe two. Head left. We'll surround them. Go on! Leave it. See to the herd, I'll deal with the wolves. It's you. My foot got caught in a strap. They thought you were a deer and attacked. Here, I picked up your rifle. You did what you could. It had to end like this. You know that. Good, Vladim. You'll make a good keeper next summer. Serguei? Get lost! - Take a look outside. - Get lost! If I were you, I'd go. There are six of them. Six! Six? We killed six of them. Six... There were five of your wolves left. They weren't our wolves, Naztazia! They aren't our wolves. I'm happy too. But you won't spend your life with the wolves, will you? Thanks to this story and my son Serguei, I saw the wolves aren't our enemies when they don't attack our deer. Now, I have to teach Serguei that wolves must remain wolves and not become our friends. That's what dogs are for. And we Eveny, we must remain nomads, defending our reindeer forever. This balance is called harmony. The harmony we wish to live in, among our mountains with the deer and with the wolves. Subtitles: Ian Burley Subtitling: C.M.C.
