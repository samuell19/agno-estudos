I know clubs, I Wanted to open a restaurant... Yeah, I know. Maybe it would be good for me. It would be good to leave. When I left, you made fun of me. You said it was a shit country. And now you're interested? What are you thinking? You think things just fall into your lap? You find some friendly, helpful guy and it all works out? You must be dreaming. I don't know if I can trust you. And my partners... are tough. Tell them I'm tough too. You're going to need cash too. L-low much'? We're all putting 15 grand into it. If you want in too, I'll need that up front before I leave. You'll need to make aliyah. What, “okay”? - Know What aliyah means? - Yeah. Some sudden urge, is it? If you like. Yeah. You won't do it.

I have to pick up a client at the airport! What's up? What's so urgent? I need 15 grand. 15 grand's a lot! - Only coke can get you that. - I know. Okay... Why do you need that much? My cousin has a deal in Israel. Where they Wear pancakes on their heads? What the fuck'll you do there? They're yarmulkes, asshole. You're abandoning me then? What are you talking about? Great idea, selling dope to get to the Holy Land. You lecture me for years and now you Want in. Lend me a hand here. Keep still. I won't tell my cousin. I'm pressed for time, that's all. I'll quit dealing after. Okay, don't move. Thanks. And your brother? - He knows you're going? - He doesn’t need to. Right, your brother's bad luck. - And you're good luck? - You bet! I can't drop you. Use your moped. I don't have time. Call me tonight. - Call me. - I will. I'm looking for the mosque. - I think I'm lost. - Hi, Alex. - How's it going? - Fine. And you? I Wanted to catch up. We didn't talk at Aline's. I'm okay. What are you doing here? I need you. Last time you said that, you left me. I need Hebrew lessons. You're really going to Israel? You? To Israel? With Nathan. But... the place is full of Jews. It is? Got many Jewish friends? Not many. Not many... A lot of Jews together can be a real drag. Look at our families. Stop being like this. You've been to Israel a lot. Not to settle there. But I Want to. Will you do it? I don't see why I Would. - Because you're a saint. - Don't blaspheme. Saturday at 8:00. 8100? In the morning, stupid. I have to get back in there. Thank you. You can go in. Hold your arms out, please. Can you name the Jewish holidays? - The Jewish holidays? - Yes, go on. Pessah, Hanukah, Shabbat... All right. Step through the security gate. Come with me, please. I'm David Meyer, your shaliah. I'm Franco-Israeli and I'm here for three years to help French Jews make aliyah. That's also lsrael's desire as I'm sure you know. You must go as ifs the land of all Jews. You don't Want a new life by chance. You don't Want to go there by chance. Look at this portrait. This is Theodore Herzl. The inventor of Zionism. 720g okay? He saw it as the best way to fight anti-Semitism and for the Jews to take control of their destiny. Isn't that a fine idea? Don't think life is easy in the Promised Land. You'll leave the comfort of France for Israel, a land on the verge of war, constantly at war, some say. It's an important act, a decisive one and you must remember that at all times. Do you all understand? Questions now. I'll hand out programs and then we'll begin. Are you nervous? No. It's just an interview. Don't worry, you're not there yet. Do you know Israel Well? I Went once as a kid. What? Applicants who don't really know Israel are rare. What does that change? Nothing at all. Why do you Want to go? I can have a job there in a restaurant. I need to see to the renovation. It's an opportunity. You Want to leave totally unprepared? I just don't Want to do military service. You want the advantages without the drawbacks? How old are you? Twenty-seven. Too old for military service. But you can be a reservist in wartime. You realize that? So What do I have to do? You'll need a certificate of Jewishness. That's what we call it. The consistory can help you. Fill out the form, then come back to see me. One last thing, Mr. Raphaelson. Any prior convictions? No. Say so if you have any. Someone kept his criminal record from me once. On landing in Israel, they sent him back. He may not be able to return. I have no record. - Here to see Polo? - Yeah. Alex, a pal. A pal? Go on in. You're like David Piggy. Remember him? He dealt with me when we sold on the street. When we did hash, he'd come every day... And every day, he'd ask to sell on the streets. He'd say, “I Want a bite of the apple too.” We didn't Want a new guy, especially a Jew, around here. Then he started buying his own goods and came to sell on our turf. We'd smashed his teeth in and he'd come back. A whole month like that! After a month, we saw how stubborn he was. He wasn't giving up. So we let him sell. I think we called him David Piggy after that. I don't know why. Maybe the jerk ate pork. You Wanted 40g? - 40g, right? - As usual. Can we try it'? I'm looking for... Where is there... How do i get to... Which bus goes to... Drive me to please. Where can buy... Fuck off! He has problems with his girl. With Anaélle. He wants to save their relationship. He couldn't tell me himself? He thought you'd suffer less if you didn't see him. So you're his messenger? In ancient times they used to burn bearers of bad tidings! You and your brother are cowards! Pigs! I'll drag you through the dirt. He lied to me... He said we'd go to Venice but I never saw a gondola. He said he'd leave Anaelle too! He even wrote me poems. No guy wrote me poems before. I know ifs sad but you mustn't call him. He'll soon come back. - You'll be okay? - Piss off! He's bad news and now he writes poems! Keep well away! Jeanne! Recognize me? Yes, of course. You were busy. I didn't Want to disturb you. It's not a problem. It's not What you think. I know What I saw. You were making a girl cry. I don't know her. It's because of my brother. Want to have coffee? I don't drink the stuff myself but will you have one with me? People like you drink coffee. Really? What kind of people? Students. You're a student? I'll have a beer if that's okay. So you know Esther. We met in Oriental Languages. I do Japanese, not Hebrew. What use is Japanese? I can open a sushi bar. I Want to translate. You know Esther's my ex? Ex how'? Exceptional? Exasperating. What do you do now? N ow'? I'm opening a restaurant in Israel. When? Why do you Want to know? You're right, I don't need to know. I like clumsy guys. They move me. They move you? You move me anyhow. You're beautiful today. The light was bad last time. Or maybe I don't see things. That's possible too. Excuse me. Give me two minutes. I'll call you back. Let me out, please. Sorry. Got anything? Come on, stay! I have to work. Having a good time? Yeah, ace. And you? What did you do yesterday? Take your time. Speak clearly. Yesterday? You do remember? Yes. I got up, Went to the café, had a smoke, read the paper... In Hebrew, stupid. I don't know “read the paper.” I know “smoke”... Go on then. The time? What time was it? I forget how to say the time. No, try to remember! Twelve... And “o'clock”... - Then I saw a friend. - Who'? You won't be pleased. Mathias! You still see that jerk? He's my best pal. In Hebrew. I don't know how. He's never let me down. You never liked him? What's “demanding”? You're too demanding. Only with those I love. This is hopeless. You remember nothing. I'll give you a book. The one my primary school class uses. - So you're getting married? - Yes, I am. Before the rabbi, then a party at your parents'... At his parents'. - Do I know him? - I don't think so. No one knows him. The invisible man. No, he's a Mossad agent. The Mossad... I imagined a fat guy in import-export. You jerk! He's skinny and teaches biology. Biology? Fascinating! If you wear a wig, I'll trash your place. A wigs not you. I won't Wear a wig. I'm not marrying a bearded guy. In Israel, you'll see plenty of girls with pretty wigs and nylon tights... when ifs 120 in the shade! Not in Tel Aviv. Will you fight if you have to? Will you do that if there's a war? No. Wait a second. Will you kill people? Palestinians if you have to? For your country? I told you no. I'm too old for the army and I told them I won't fight. I'll vote left-wing. If it makes you feel better... I just don't get it. We agreed, right? When we saw them leave, even Nathan, we said our life was here. Jews but Parisian Jews. That place wasn't for us. If you have to leave, go to Canada or Australia. I'm not into kangaroos. Why am I so mad you're leaving? At the worst time too. Everyone's coming back. Maybe the country's as screwed up as I am. Your future was so bright. You could have done anything. But you deal and now you're off to Israel. I quit dealing. Come on, Esther... Look at yourself! You teach in our old school, you're marrying a Jew, you've never moved from here. You think you're liberated? Come on, tell me. I'm very happy with him. Great. Good morning. Follow me, please. L-low can I help you'? I need to see a rabbi. Which one? We have several here. It's for a certificate of Jewishness. You're an aliyah applicant? You need Rabbi Schulmann but he's away this week. Is it urgent? Yes. I don't have my parents' ketubah. You'll need to prove they're Jewish with their family records book, say. A Jewish name will work. That's all? A Jewish name is enough? We can complicate things if you want... What are their surnames? Katz and Raphaelson. Raphaelson and Katz should work. Someone's at the door! I'm late. Sorry. That's okay. I have some of your mom's boxes. They're full of junk. Come on. The family records book should be here. I'll let you look. Found it. Lucky I kept it. I don't need it now that she's dead. They're curious. You remember him? He's Alex, my son. You were too little last time you saw him. L-low about a hello'? Set the table. Want to eat? There may not be enough... No. I can't. I'm leaving for Israel. Really? You know the place? No. What'll you do there? Work with Nathan. You're going to Work? Thaw do you good. And your brother? How'll he manage Without you? He doesn't know. Of course, he doesn't know. If he did, he'd stop you. He thinks you owe him everything. He even used to say he was your true father, right? Not asking about him? And Gabriel? L-low is he'? - He's doing well at school. - That's good. Need anything else? Got 5,000 euros to spare? My hands are full. I won't show you out. Have a safe trip then. And keep in touch. Bye. Who is it? It's Jeanne. I got here early. Can you let me in? Just a second! Just a second! How's it going? So this is your cavern? May I? Go on. - You deal? - What? You deal. I know you do. No, I don't deal. I don't mind. I'm flattered you're denying it. I said I don't deal. Is that you? “Hebrew conversation kit.” it's serious then. “Israel, rediscover happiness and serenity.” “Israel, a successful journey, joy for life.” “Three steps to obtain a certificate of Jewishness.” Well? What? You're a certified Jew now'? I'm working on it. You have family in Israel? My cousin. And? That's all. Nothings really planned. “Delivery of single ticket.” Not a return one? What are you thinking? Nothing at all. So you're leaving. My turn. Are you looking for God in Israel? No. I'm going because... no one's asking me to stay. Not even my father. He doesn't care. What if I ask you? Stay. My brother sucks at football. Isaac! Seen who's here? Let's tell them. You're here. And with company too. This is Jeanne. We have some big news. I've proposed to Anaélle. Know What I did? I got clown on my knees. I gave her a ring and I said, “I love you, will you be my wife?” And this crazy Woman accepted! Show them the ring to prove it. Be my best man. You'll be great. Let's open the champagne. A drop more? Please. Been with Alex long? You're curious. No, but my brother's love life is a mystery for me. Maybe we aren't technically together. Technically... If he brought you here, ifs serious. He keeps me hidden. You're so irresistible? No, I'm the shame of the family, the ugly duckling. Meeting the ugly duckling is a good sign? Yes. Why not? I think it means I can't stop him. Hes going anyway. Going where? To Israel. To Tel Aviv. You didn't know? You're not going too? Why not? I wouldn't worry. He never does What he says he will. You'll see, he won't go. Tell them to wait. No, they needn’t bother. What do you need? 40g. Business is good for you. It's okay. Seen my earrings? Try the bathroom. Here. Watch out, hide it carefully. I'm trusting you. Isaac? Are you okay? What the hell happened? Come on. Shit, that stings! Got no normal stuff? Look at me. Where were you? Around, hunting clown cash. And? I saw the Sarcelles guys. Four of them laid into me. They'll do worse if I don't pay them back. What do you owe them'? Four. Four grand. I can't help. I need the money. What for? To live, asshole! I don't know. To live... Can you put me up till I heal? So Ana won't see this. What'll you tell her? That I'm in Bordeaux or something. She'll buy that? No, but she can't see me like this. You really need the money? What for? You have plans? Big plans? His lordship has big plans? That's it. Fuck... I should shoot myself. Get a gun, stick it here and shoot. Just like that. Ana... it's me. I have to go to Bordeaux to see a guy about some watches. No, two days at the most. Then I'll stay put. No, I'm fine, don't worry. Yeah, me too. I'll call you. Two grand but I come with you. No, keep away from those shits. It's my money. If you take it, I come too. What now? I'm coming with you. You're here. What more do you Want? If I'm not back in 'lo minutes, it's the 3rd floor, left door. Alex, you awake? All set? Yeah, thanks. You thank me now? Yeah. Why not? When it suits you, huh? Otherwise, its “Gimme cash, I'm in the shit, I'm getting married.” Not for the wedding. No, I had to deal with your pharmacist. And I do it! My little brother takes care of me. Think that's funny? I'd like to visit Mom's grave. Right now? Esther's getting married. I know. How do you know'? I see her. Meaning? - What? - You fool around? Fool around? The Words you use! I like it. Know What it means? Yes, I do. So do you fool around? No, we don't. it's over. You were mad about her. You jumped in that shallow pond at camp because of her. That was a suicide attempt. I don't believe you. You're a romantic. Maybe more romantic than me. And Jeanne? What about her? You love her? All these big Words. Love! I don't know. Love... it's simple. - You love her, you don't... - I ddon't know. - She loves you. - She does? You're a real Casanova. That's your problem. I'm not like you. I've had more girls than you think. Not that many passable ones. You mean Anaélle isn't pretty'? She's good, yeah. You see. Is her eyesight okay? You're jealous. So jealous ifs crazy! In fact, I've just realized that you're really jealous of me. It's crazy. You can't deny my son's good-looking? Very good-looking. How's it going? Come in. - The usual? - 40. Your pal Mathias is here. - He's here? - Yeah, come on. How's it going, pal? L-low are you'? Everyone, look at this guy. He's my best pal. I'd do anything for him. Anything. You know that? What you don't know is he's smart. This guy's a fox. When we're behind bars, he'll feed our families. You won't dump me when I'm in trouble. You won't, huh? No. Come and talk. Hold on... Listen to me, pal. Listen... You have to listen to me. Listen to me, okay! You're my brother. I'm your brother too. We'll go to Rotterdam, buy dope and make ourselves a fortune. Tomorrow night, you and me, we go to Rotterdam. We load up the trunk. It can be done in one night. That's What you wanted? A lot of money fast. - It's not that. - It is. It's all set up. Lucie's coming. Three business students visiting Holland. I'll use one of the oars. Don't worry, it's all set up. It won't work, Mathias. His ambition... This guy's sole fucking ambition... is to open a fucking pancake house in Israel! Piss off, loser! - Calm clown, Mathias. - I'm okay. Go on, piss off! I have the cash. Know What? You're nothing, nothing at all. Fuck! Fuck! Relax. If customs see your sour mug, we've had it. Okay back there, Lucie? Cool? Talk to me. What's up? Nothing. Just drive, okay. I won't be long! Thanks. Listen to me carefully. I've never been this serious. I'll join Lucie at the coffee machine. I'll go in now. I'll forget the keys in the ignition. Once I'm inside, I'll take my time. Maybe I'll chat with her or try to get a kiss. Or two. And, While I do that... you'll calm your nerves, slap your face the Way you do to wake yourself up... You'll look at the bag of cash and realize you need it. That it'd be dumb to get stopped and lose that much dough. So you'll start the car, think of your pal Mathias who's actually a great guy, and then head back to Paris. Get it? What about Polo? I'll say I never saw it coming. Lucie can back me up. If he blows a fuse, I'll do a run to pay him back. And you can pay me back in kosher pancakes. I can go with you. I don't Want you to. I'm doing this for my own sake. I need to. And you have to get away from Isaac. I'll take this. For the trip back. May I? Here. They belong to my dad. Boxers, socks, a sweater, jeans. What you asked me for. Your flight's this evening? I land in Tel Aviv at 4:00 am. tomorrow. I have time to tell you a story. Interested? To say good-bye- Let's say... J is me and A is you. J... loves A. But... A... is more complicated than expected, meaning that J, who loves complications, loves him even more. A, meanwhile... You're following? He's caught up in What we'll call EP for existential problems. And that touches J even more but she won't show it. But he has a brother... I... who makes his life hell. And he also has an ex, E, that he loved a lot. So, to sum things up... Move. A is surrounded by... I, E and EP'. And J... would like to have her place. You see? Shed love to break the other bonds because J is unique and, moreover, A knows it. The trouble is, since A thinks that Israel will bring him serenity, the love... between J and A... is impossible. I think that A adores J. Once he has done something good in his life... then he can be loved. But A will miss sleeping with J because J is a good lay even if she dozes off too soon. True, J is a very good lay. As for J, she'll miss the little hatless dick that A has. I don't understand. Subtitles: Ian Burley Subtitled by L.V.T. - Paris
