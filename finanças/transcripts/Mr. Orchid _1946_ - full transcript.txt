Old Peace-and-Quiet The life of a French family during the Occupation You're looking over my little bottles. We must thank Mrs. Renault, she's brought us some good coffee How nice! It's a very good recipe I've been given. A mixture of crushed peas and horse chestnuts. It's excellent. Thank you. These cuttings must take a lot of time. He spends all his time at it. My orchids are my sole passion. Are they fragile? It's the germination in the bottle which is - oh, give that to me, dear! It's not a toy. The bottle's the least expensive thing about them. Have you ever seen a passion that was free? You'd see if I kept a dancing girl. Look how beautiful it is. Have you seen that factory they're building next door? I'd be scared! Me too. As soon as it's done the English will bomb it. When will these dirty Boche leave, Mr. Martin? - Is that eleven o'clock? - Yes. I'm going to be late! - Where are you going? - To see a client about a policy. - At the cafe? - Of course. My wife doesn't see that for me, the cafe is like an office. She doesn't understand; she never will. In my opinion, you're the world's bravest man. When he claims he has only one weakness, it's his beloved card game. Don't be late. I'm in no hurry, with what we'll be eating. The kids will be home from school, we have to be on time. Goodbye, neighbor, and thanks again for the coffee. Goodbye, Colette. You're not young anymore, wear your scarf. And go by Laprade's to pick up your medicine. - I'm not coughing anymore. - With all this April rain you will. - Off you go. - Goodbye! Men! Drinking, always drinking. My poor husband's getting old. Sit down a bit, and have a drop. Yes, he's in a rut, becoming a homebody. His little corner by the fire, playing cards with his friends at the cafe... ...that's enough for him. Cheers. Diamonds! Diamonds are my suit! I'm out. - What time is it? - Nearly noon. My wife'll kill me! See you later, boys. I'd like to speak to the owner. I'll see. Who should I say? Mr. Jourdan - he won't know me. I'll check. Mr. Charles! - Mr. Charles Janvier? - Yes? Could I speak to you in private? This way. Mr. Janvier, I'll come straight to the point. You've expressed some opinions in your cafe that could cause you problems. - Me? - Yes, you. I know all about you. Don't be afraid. Here are my papers. I'm Captain Jourdan; I've escaped from Germany for the second time. Look these over, then we can talk more freely. - You've come from London? - Yes. Three days ago. I parachuted in south of Poitiers Saturday night. It's bad timing for you; the Gestapo is here. You don't have to tell me. - What do you want? - Not much. I know the town's best patriots meet in your cafe every night. Who told you that? Introduce me discreetly, and under my direction, without much danger... ...they can render a great service to our cause. So you want to stir up trouble here. I can't hide a thing from you. I don't know what you mean, Captain. I don't get involved in such things. One can never be too careful, but just look at these papers. Papers... papers... Last time, they gave me 5 ice-cold baths in half an hour. The fifth one, I passed out. Saved my life; they thought I was dead. It's incredible these bastards... I have the impression Moissan agrees with me. Isn't this where Beckmann disappeared? - Beckmann? - A Gestapo man. It's possible. Animals! - I'd like to— - Careful! You're late. Wait, something's trailing behind you. Just look at that. So depressing. See you later. - Hello children. - Hello, Mr. Martin. - Hello, Mr. Martin. - Hello. It's cold this morning. That was my fourth parachute jump. It was still dark. Last time, I landed in the garden of a funeral chapel. It brought you luck. Say, those guys playing cards. Do you think they'd be interested? No, they're all old duffers. You see the one blowing his nose? They call him Old Peace-and-Quiet. Says it all, right? They wouldn't be interested. Prepare for a beating, gentlemen. For our job, it's agreed for tomorrow. You and you will be in the first wave. - And us? - Your turn will be next Saturday. Be careful, don't be hasty. I'll wait for you tomorrow at Angoulême station, when the 4:00 train gets in. You'll carry guns, papers and money. - You're Boiron; and you? - Lemoine. You understand my instructions? Piece of cake. And each one carrying money. Maybe to buy groceries? Don't play games with us. We're very well informed. You came here to Angoulême, carrying money and papers to the terrorists... ...on behalf of an escaped officer named Jourdan. If you thought that, you wouldn't have arrested us at the station. You'd have followed us to see where we went. And these bullets. What's that all about? Don't get cute. And this. No need to follow you. We know how to make you talk. Out! Well, you got them. Did it work? Yes. But all the guys you've rustled up - nicht gut. They're small fry who need to be crushed. But we want the men at the top. I'll get them. Good. Still nothing on Beckmann? No. But I already told you he didn't disappear in Moissan. Moisson is a quiet, commonplace little town. - You know better than our police, eh? - I didn't say that. Well, look for your leads in Moissan. That's the source. Your quiet, commonplace little town. This is no time for jokes! The general is furious. For such a calm little town, there's a bomb nearly every night. - Right? - Yes. Well, then. I haven't found anything. Another one! All of Moissan will be blown up if this goes on. I think it's the Carnot garage. Halt! - What is it? - The Carnot garage. - Is it bad? - Up in flames. Come in. Good morning Madame. Good morning, Marie. You can open the curtains. Breakfast, Edouard. Monsieur is still asleep. Did Pierre and Mademoiselle leave on time? Mr. Pierre will be late. - Did you hear it last night? - No. You're lucky you sleep so well. An awful explosion; it made me jump up in bed. They blew up a Boche garage. Don't say Boche in front of me. Say a German garage. They blew up a German garage with 50 Boche inside. Breakfast. A good piece of work; the 5th bomb to go off in Moissan. No, the fourth. The terrorists and their plots will end up blowing us all up if this goes on. - Did you hear it? - Did I! Were you home? Yes, I'd just taken off my trousers. Then Boom! Very scary. - You're always scared. - It was a surprise. Mr. Pelletier is waiting for you downstairs. - About an insurance policy. - I'm coming - But your breakfast! - I'm not hungry. - It'll get cold. - I'll have something later. This is how you look after yourself. Business comes first. When people come to see me, it's not to play games. I don't have time to wait around. Sir says he was home but it's not true. He wasn't here during the explosion. He came in after; quite a bit after. One day he'll come a cropper; those Germans are bad right now. When he's playing cards at the cafe, he loses track of the time. Can't say precisely, the police are everywhere. But everything inside went up. Well, I came along with Simon— Come into my office, we'll see. - I hope we're not disturbing you. - Never, when it's business. You're just mad because I said your dad talked to the Germans. So maybe they asked for his papers; what do you expect him to do? No, they had a nice little chat. Well, what does it have to do with you? Pierre, we're late! Why are you butting in? Enjoy your lunch all the same. You see what trouble Dad causes us. It's not much fun. In 1914 he was a sergeant; 7 citations by 1918. He wasn't chatting nicely with the Germans then! - He's older and calmer. - Not calm enough to like Krauts! - Dad, did you see the Carnot garage? - No. Turn that down, please. Will you turn that off? You're always scared, Dad. If someone outside hears, you won't be in trouble, I will. It's fantastic! I'll get the salt. I was talking about the bombed garage. Have you seen it, Dad? - I said no. - They sure showed your Krauts! You want a smack? What do you mean 'my Krauts'? Oh, don't start! If you keep arguing, I'm going to eat in the kitchen. I'm not arguing, just talking. Go on, talk then. Why did you say MY Krauts? Because... nothing. - Go on! - Because it's like you're on their side. You won't even listen to London. I do what everyone does. I'm careful. - What do you want your father to do? - Join the Resistance? Well, I can't stand it. Oh, poor dear. You're a nervous wreck. - What was that about the garage? - The Boche got it good. Wrecked? There's nothing left. They knew what they were doing. I really admire those guys. Two German colonels arrived yesterday. They were blown up with all the cars. How horrible! - Who told you that? - The mayor. - Was he sure? - He saw the bodies. Those guys were well informed. Well, it could have just been luck. You always minimize things. I think those guys are ace. What a way to talk! They're ACES. - What's so funny? - You just said they're aces. Incurable. Hey! There's something wrong with my bike. It's nothing at all, Captain. Quite a score last night, eh? Yes, 30 cars and 2 colonels. I hope things don't get worse. - I tip my hat to the guys who did it. - Me too. You know any patriots? - Oh well, there are a few. - You know any? Big Lemoine at the cafe the other night. He left suddenly for Angoulême. It wasn't to buy a new suit. I'm sure of it. It seems the Resistance are all youngsters. Flavigny Crossroads, Mazère Spring, Lavillatte Cross. The first one's tonight, pass the word. - Flavigny Crossroads? - Right. Code name Raymond? Edouard! What is it? Don't close it. Hold my bike, I'll be right back. Be proud - holding the bike for your secret love. Quiet! You look a proper fool. - I'll be off. - See you at noon. - What are you looking for in here? - Scissors - I broke a nail. - Next time ask before coming in here. - You have no secrets from your daughter! Yes indeed, my girl, and I'd like to keep them. - Flavigny Crossroads— - Give me that! Mazère Spring, Lavillatte Cross— secrets? Tree insurance. Give it back, and don't mess with my papers. Flavigny Crossroads, Mazère Spring, Lavillatte Cross - I know them by heart. Be off with you. - Alright, I'm off. - Get out! That'll teach me. I'm here for my piano lesson. B flat! That's enough for tonight. Goodnight, sir. So, Flavigny Crossroads? Near Pléville, tonight. - Tonight. - Yes. 150 grams for Madame. - Hello, you have my order? - Sent to your house. - You've been paid? - Yes. Did you get my fishing lines in? - Yes. - Could I see them? Hello, Mr. Caille. - Do you have my papers? - Everything's fine. - It's on for tonight. - Parachute drop? Yes, tonight, tomorrow and the next day. A different target each night. Tonight, Flavigny Crossroads. - Tomorrow night? - We'll know soon. Tonight, Flavigny Crossroads, 11 PM, code Raymond. 11 PM, code word Raymond. Halt! Oh, it's you, I didn't recognize you. There they are. Come in. - Goodnight, Mom. - Do you hear those planes? Yes. That's twice in a row. I'm afraid they're coming for the factory next door. Not in a good spot. You hear them? The Boche are screwed. Dad'll be sorry, they're screwed. Pierre! Isn't Dad here? No, he's in the greenhouse with his orchids. Don't go down there, he's locked the door. He always locks the door now. Dad's a character. Did you hear that bust-up last night? They must have been aiming for factory - Were they parachutists? - Maybe. I hope the Boche get it good, the bastards. Yup. You don't seem too fond of them either. Didn't a guy named Beckmann vanish from here? Beckmann the Gestapo guy? I don't know; probably liquidated. That would be great. He interrogated me at Angoulême. A real bastard; I remember. He disappeared a year ago, they never found him. I know, I work at city hall. Did folks from Moissan do it? If you ever see them, tell them I'd like to shake their hands. Goodbye. - Who's that? - A captain escaped from Germany. Nice guy. What was in the container last night? Just tommy guns. What we need is plastic explosives. I'll ask for it next time I radio them. What do they do with it, eat it? We've gotten 70 rolls since the start of January. That would surprise me, Chief. Fortunately, I've kept records. - Keep watch in the garden, Jean. - Got it. Help me move this, will you? Nice desk! Yes, it's top-notch. But the wood's starting to warp. With rascals like you involved, things have to be organized. Here it is. (Seed orders) Jean, come see. Pink pompom carnations; those are carnations. - Twenty feet of carnations on the 5th. - What are pink pompoms? Grenades. Another 20 on the 15th: 20 plus 20 = 40 30 feet on the 25th, that makes 70. 70 rolls of plastic, I was right. - We need twice as much. - I'll tell them. What's so funny? I didn't know those were pink pompoms we were shoving down the Boche's throats. I thought you were never coming to bed. Are the kids asleep? Yes. With your orchids we never see you anymore. Good night little dumpling. Don't call me that! It's nice and all but... I called you that when we were first engaged. One day you called me that in front of a plumber working in the kitchen. So? I heard him say to his partner, 'Did you see the little dumpling's face?' You're never happy. Goodnight old grumbler. That's better. Goodnight, dear. You hear those planes? It's the English, right? Yes. That makes 3 nights in a row. They might be going for the factory next door. It's not finished. They're not interested in it. Not yet. Lovely. Those are parachute drops. How do you know? They radioed me specially to warn me. Silly! I've been put in charge of the whole district. You'll each deliver 20,000 francs and tell them the rest will come next week. I'll give you your papers tomorrow at Angoulême station. Who's that guy? I don't know. He's not from here. He's been here a week. - What's he doing? - Ask the boss. Mr. Georges wants to know about Mr. Jourdan. Quiet! I know, you like to talk. You can't blab to just anyone. Keep your mouth shut. - But Mr. Georges... - Leave it to me. Go remove the doorknob, it's almost closing time. - He's an escaped officer. - From Germany? And I can tell you, but don't repeat this. His name's Jourdan, Captain Jourdan. He's just been made head of the Resistance for the whole district. He's come from London. You'll be gone for at least 4 days. Your friends aren't back yet. I've already told them at home I don't know when I'll be back. Perfect. - Mr. Jourdan! - Yes? I want to introduce 2 friends who'd like to meet you. Great! The more the merrier. Mr. Pelletier is keeping Sir from his breakfast. I'll be interrupting them but too bad. His bronchitis pills, quick. He's got no more sense than the children. Why's this always locked? What's with this new fad? Hiding secrets? Hello, Simon. Hello, Mrs. Martin. Eat, and take your pill. You come at breakfast time, so he doesn't eat. - How's your mother? - Much better, thanks. - Is Pierre doing well? - Yes, he's at school. And Miss Monique? She has exams at the end of June; she has a lot of work. What's the matter with you? Nothing, I was just thinking about a court case. We have to act very quickly on that. Do as I told you, then come straight back and we'll decide what to do. And don't let the two travellers see you, of course. What's going on? Nothing, some folks from a competing firm are trying to steal customers away. To get the premium. Will you let them? I don't think so. - What do you want? - Your ration card. It's in the chest in the hall. Do you know if a D ticket is good for jam? - No. - You don't know? They don't know. No one cares about the poor housewives. No one tells us anything. It's a crying shame. Once we get the proof, when will we settle this business?. Right away. We'll cancel his life insurance immediately. He must be the guy who was operating in Nerval; a dangerous bastard. - You're sitting down? - Am I in the way? No, but I don't think you'll find insurance business very exciting. Don't you have anything else to do? I thought I'd warm up in here while Marie makes the beds. It's nicer in your room. Marie told me D tickets are good for jam, but only on Day 3. Could you just keep quiet about your jam? You're happy to eat it. Yes, but we're trying to conduct important business, dear. I need a little peace and quiet. So, if the answer is affirmative... ...we'll handle this life insurance business... ...the way we did in that other case a little while back. What was the client's name? Oh, yes. The name's on the tip of my tongue. I can't quite remember. You need to take some phosphorous. Goodbye, then. They say that jam is very good. - See him? - Yes. You see those 3 guys behind him? - They're with him. - You think so? Don't lose him. He's waving. Now he's handed over papers. The guys are following them. Well, that's it. What a piece of shit. The job's going well right now. - When will it be? - Saturday, probably. Our comrades have reached their destination. Don't you want to hear about it? Did it go well? Yes, they've met up with— - Your contacts. - Right. They'll be back day after tomorrow at the latest. Are we going to Angoulême too? We can talk in front of this gentleman? Yes, I can vouch for Mr. Martin. My friend Pelletier wanted me to join your group... ...but I'm afraid I'm too old to take part. Are you afraid? Not afraid, but anyone's nervous the first time. No, but I can help you with my experience. I know the area, the people. I can give you advice, but I'm too old for conspiracy. So you say, but if you love your country we'll have you in the end. That would surprise me. So, Saturday? Yes, but I'd like to meet tomorrow night 8 o'clock. - You're going back to your hotel? - Yes, in Pléville, but I'm walking. - What about your motorbike? - It's broken down. A long time ago? No, just now, must be the battery. Cars, they work, they don't work. Don't worry, I'll drop you off. My truck's here, I go right by Pléville. I've got five minutes. I'm going to give everyone plastic explosives. What? Plastics? It's an explosive material made of nitroglycerine and clay. Say, Simon, start the motor so we don't have to wait. Got the keys? Cigarette? Now we can talk. You suspect him? No, but for important things watch out, he talks a bit too much. These are the important outposts we have to resupply. 10 minutes, in the Nassau woods, we'll pull over. - I know. - Got your car? - It's by the bridge. - Off you go then. Why are you carrying a gun? It's compromising. Oh, it's just to reassure the gentleman. OK, then. - OK? - Everything's ready. Let's go then. The back door - it's safer. Meet here to confirm. Get in. I'll take you home. No, I'll just slow you down. Of course I'll drop you off, we're going by the Nassau woods, it's on the way. There's enough room; let's go. - I'm in a hurry, let me off first. - Oh, you'll be first. - Cigarette? - Thanks. - It's the last one. - Thanks. What is it? Something sticking at the back. I'll take a look. Maybe I should have gone alone on foot. Yes, it might have been better. - What is it? - Flat tire. Come and help me. It's not completely flat, but it's going to slow us down. So you're head of the Resistance for the whole district? In charge of the whole region. - General Koenig appointed you? - Yes. Do you know him personally? Yes, I was with him a week ago in London. So you know Colonel Rouleau then? - Colonel Rouleau? - His chief of staff. Oh yes. You know him? Yes, he's an old friend. He was very sick last year. - Yes, he was. - Is he better? Yes, quite out of danger. Unlike you. Liar. You never met Colonel Rouleau. He never was sick. Because he never existed. Out of luck. An ambush. No; a just punishment. Get out. You're crazy! I'm head of the Resistance for the whole region. Take a look at my papers. Head of the Resistance for the region? You're looking at him. Simon, go to his hotel room and go through all his papers. Got it; the hotel manager is one of ours. Goodnight Chief. Let's go, Pelletier, it's late. My wife will give me what for. - It's you? - Yes, it's me. - I was wondering what was wrong. - What do you suppose could be wrong? - We've already started. - Good. I brought Pelletier for dinner. I'm sorry, Mr. Martin insisted. Quite right. Well, what have you been up to? What do you think? Cards! One hand, then a second and a third... Hello, Dad. Dad's in a bad mood. - Hello, Monique. - Hello. - You're mad? - I don't like barflies. She's giving you a scolding. Come check this out. Did you lose your game? No, I won, and won big. Never mind, come to the table. What is that ear-splitting music? A new record; did you know I collect fanfares? This is the march Napoleon's Guard played the night of the battle of Marengo. It's called "Victory is Ours". You picked a great moment. I traded my sister's tennis racquet for it. - Which racquet? - The one you said you'd give me. Why, of all the nerve! You must have noticed— Come on, no more noise, that's enough. Come to the table, Jean. Look at your shoes! Playing cards gets your shoes in such a state? Monique, bring a towel. What's for dinner? Leek soup, rabbit with carrots. Ruddy carrots. It's burnt by now. All the better. What? The longer it cooks, the softer they'll be. Dad, when are you going to get rid of that sweater? It's awful. When you find me another one. - You don't think my sweater looks good? - It'd look good in a museum. Your card partners are married men too. You should think of their wives. Lemaire isn't married. Neither is Popineau. Captain Jourdan neither. You know Jourdan, Pierre? Captain Jourdan, yes. - Since when? - Three days ago. Come to the table! Just in time. - You've already eaten. - Yes, but thought I'd just— The way these boys eat. Come, Jean, sit next to Monique. - She's happy. - Idiot! - So you know Jourdan? - Yes. - Who introduced you? - Roger. Your cousin. They're going to do a bunch of stuff together. I'd like to help. He's crazy. Dummy. Associating with shady types can have terrible consequences! You don't like him because he's a Gaullist. - Listen to your father, he's right. - Look at you, 25 and just playing cards! - Pierre! - What's got into him? Go to your room. You've finished your dinner, so go to your room. Once and for all, I forbid you to concern yourself with the war! Your job is studying; this isn't something for someone your age. And never you mind what other people don't do; just what they do. He should stay here, his room isn't heated. Then you can sit in a corner with your textbooks, and keep quiet. And just what is that? "Ravagers of the Alaric Isles" I said textbooks! - What were you this week? - 37th - Are you done, Monique? - I'm finished. Let's have some music; it'll change the subject. Yes, Monique, play that banned tune I like so much. - We'd enjoy that. - And you take your drops. Play, Monique. - Someone's at the door. - I said play. It's Mr. Simon. What is it? It's this policy you haven't signed yet. You didn't need to bother about it tonight. Come along for a moment. I had to bother you because it's urgent. - As bad as that? - Yes. Simon looks a bit crazy. You think so? - When did it happen? - He was arrested just now. He's my direct contact. If he talks, I'm done for. What do we do? - Have the others been warned? - Yes. We have to wait. Lie low. You disappear for a few days, Simon. Take a trip. OK. Did you go through Jourdan's room? Yes, I found this. It's a letter, but I don't know German. You're fluent in German, Chief? Nothing interesting. Pretty poor German. No, nothing of interest. This looks like a list in code. This must be the copy of a list in code. The Germans must have the original. It's annoying. "Full moon"; what does that mean? Maybe Lemoine? Florus, Morganaise, Malacéine, Old Crock... Malacéine... is that me? Crème Malacéine, Crème Simon? Calm down. This could be a list from last year, in another town. "Old Crock" - that could be me, if it comes to that. Come on, have a glass of wine, you'll feel better. I had the impression— What is it? Nothing, dear; go on playing. Time for bed soon, kids, it's late. - You're not eating any more? - No, that's enough. - You didn't have a thing. - I'm not hungry anymore. - How about you, Jean? - No thanks, Madame. It's not reasonable. I'm going to give you a tonic tomorrow. You have to eat, what's wrong with you? Nothing, I don't feel like it. Too busy. Could you bring us a drop to drink? I'm tired tonight, excuse me. - Go quickly, my friend. - I'm off to bed. Don't disturb yourself, Miss Monique. Goodnight. Goodnight, Mr. Simon. Did you have something to drink? Yes, thank you Mrs. Martin. By the way, in the gas line I heard there were 3 parachute drops last week. Boussereau's wife told me. She saw the report. She said they were at the something-or-other Crossroads... - The Four-Way Crossroads? - No, the Flavigny Crossroads. Then at the Mazère Spring and the last one at Lavillatte Cross. What's that, Mom? I was saying... I'm happy to hear that. There were 3 parachute drops: at the Flavigny Crossroads... ...the Mazère Spring and Lavillatte Cross. Mazère Spring? I know it. Why are you looking at me like that? Nothing. You're my father's main assistant, aren't you? Yes, why? I just never really understood... Mr. Martin? That's us. We'd like to see him. Yes, sir. The Boche are here! The Boche! Will you be quiet! I've told you not to say Boche; people are deported for less. All I hear is the Boche, the dirty Boche, the lousy Bo— - Gentlemen. - Madame. Some German officers asking for you, sir. - What's happened? - I don't know anything about it. What's wrong, Dad? - Calm down. - I'm so scared, sir! - Where are they? - In the hall. - Show them to the parlor. - What'll you do? - I'll think of something. - What'll happen? Make yourselves scarce. Disappear! - Mr. Martin? - Yes, sir. Do you speak German? No, I don't, I'm sorry. I am Lieutenant Fleischer. This is Colonel Müller, director-general of the regional police force... ...and Grossweiser, attaché to the Propaganda Staffel. We'd like to have a few minutes of your time, if your schedule would permit. I'm listening, gentlemen. What can the Germans want with Old Peace-and-Quiet? - I want to hear what they're saying. - Come back! - I'll do my own bit of espionage. - Stay here! You don't understand anything; stay quiet. That boy will get himself killed! Grossweiser is a horticulturalist from Dresden. We're interested in seeing your orchid collection. Everyone says it's a very rare and remarkable collection. Of course, gentlemen. But my orchid collection is not that interesting... ...and they've just started to flower. You've come a little early. It doesn't matter; we'd like to see your method. Please follow me. This is the first year I've produced flowers. And you started them from seed? Yes, I chose certain varieties, and had to obtain pollen from abroad. This way. It was rather difficult to obtain the pollen. I'm afraid I had to order it from London. - Was that long ago? - About 7 1/2 years ago. - Really? - Orchids take 8 years to flower. They've come to see the orchids. 'I'd be delighted, gentlemen, this way, please follow me.' He makes my blood boil! If it were me, I'd take them to the cellar. Slippery steps— they'd break their necks. Don't worry, Mom, they're just after the flowers. - Where's Monique? - I don't know. It doesn't make money for me. This represents 8 years of effort, disappointments, failures and emotion... ...due to the fragility of the plant. What does he say? He says you have a great deal of patience. Yes, it's necessary. You don't know anything about growing orchids? Then I'll explain. Orchids must always face the same way. Continually moving it this way and that will kill the plant. So naturally, no one is allowed to touch this shelf. No one! Not even to clean behind. This row of pots hasn't been moved more than 10 centimeters for 26 months. What does he say? He says this flower is a living pastel. With a delicate and sensitive color. I thought he was scolding me! If you come back in 2 months, you'll see fireworks, the grand finale. We only came by today for a short visit, but we will certainly come back. But now duty calls, and we will take our leave. Feel free to come back in August, if you're still here. If we're still here? Yes, you could be reassigned to Poland or Russia. I hope not. Yes, France is nicer. It's very interesting, sir. Any news of this landing in Normandy? A flop. They're going. I want to play a little tune for their departure. It all went well, but I was scared. Why? So you ran and hid... Shut up, cretinus! The French didn't used to be so indifferent to the problems of Europe. They're a close second in combat, but they don't understand their own interests. No, they don't understand. Throughout history, they've been considered good and brave soldiers. I don't understand their apathy today. Have you been in France long? Since November 14, 1940. Three and a half years. Don't judge the French too quickly. It takes time to understand them. It might take 4 or 5 years, but in time you'll understand them. - I hope so. - So do I. Who is playing that music? It's my son's record. - He likes military music? - Yes, unfortunately. Goodbye for now, sir. What did they come for? Nothing. For my orchids. What's wrong? You look very odd. I've got a confounded daughter as curious as an old cat! Always pestering her poor old father with silly questions. And a son who makes me deaf with his trumpets. Grumpy old Dad, I love you so much! These French; in the middle of a war, they're planting flowers! Unfortunately, in Moissan, some are also planting bombs. Go ahead, Chief. - No, stop! - Again? - Nothing there? - Yes, there's a cart. This is a bad spot. We have to find a new one. He's crazy, it's a donkey cart! I heard that at Tours they camouflaged their detector in a hay wagon. When they come we have to advise them to attack that way... ...over the buildings to the north. That'll put them over our neighborhood. You'll evacuate your family? - I don't know. - You have to, Chief! It's OK. Go ahead. "Suspicious activity Moissan factory... ...5 days ago... ...hoist cranes on site... 50-tonne cranes... ...electrical devices installed great haste... ...loading bays north of factory." Stop. Go ahead. No, no, stop Chief. I was just fixing my motor. Food delivery. Din-din truck. Yum yum. They won't bother us for a bit. - OK? - OK. "Enemy seems to expect arrival of heavy guns... ...tanks or plane fuselages. Will keep you informed - out." Done. Tell Simon he can go. What about the danger to your family? - Could you get me a drink? - Of course. Thanks for your concern. - I'm very fond of you, Chief. - Same here. - My family's very fond of you too. - What? I said my family is very fond of you too. My wife, my son... everyone. Move that. - And a glass for Simon? - Yes, I forgot. He'll be straight up when he smells the bottle. That's a nice photo of Monique back there. Yes, it's nice. Monique gave it to me last week for my birthday. I understand. I'm getting a little idea. You know what I think? No, what? I think we'll give them a knockout blow. Yes, I hope so. But if you call in the attack, won't your family get caught? I don't know. Moissan itself has nothing to fear, the fairgrounds are in between. But us? How many are near the factory? Four houses. Us, Renault, Vimont, Charrat. All friends. And I'm the one who has to give the signal. There are times in this job... Fighting! Idiot. So the grown-ups' war isn't enough? - You'll be punished. - He said my father is a collaborator! I'll show you I'm no chicken! Mr. Martin, I had you come here... you don't speak German, I believe? No, as I said before, I'm afraid not. I had you come to ask if you knew this Jourdan, who has disappeared. I do know Mr. Jourdan, but I haven't seen him for some time. I didn't know he'd disappeared. Did you know him well? No, but enough to conclude that he's a scoundrel. What do you mean by that? - He's a real scoundrel. - Explain. - He's a Gaullist. - No. No? I can confide in you, knowing your character as a good Frenchman. He was one of our agents. Come in. Excuse me for a moment. The commander of the convoy of 20 fuel trucks we expected tonight... ...telegraphed that he's late, and won't reach Moissan before midnight. He got a flat tire outside Poitiers. Are we still delivering it to the barracks at Marmont? What's wrong, Dad, are you hurt? It's nothing, it's over. I fell over the garbage can. The moon's bright tonight. I guess your old Dad's going gaga. No, Dad, you're not gaga. You do the bravest things, and nobody knows. Except your daughter who's as curious as an old cat. What are you talking about? Don't bother, I understand everything. - Understand what? - Everything. I hope you'll keep your crazy notions to yourself. I'm too proud of knowing your secret to want to share it. I hope you won't tell your mother about this. Or your brother. That nut! All your lives are at stake. Back to bed. Is Jean your right hand man? You seem to like the idea. Why? So he can watch over your father? Dad, I'm so proud of you. Off to bed. If I could... I'm so worried for you. Don't. Go to bed. Soon... in fact, any moment now... Don't be scared, you're going to hear a big boom. Twenty fuel trucks are going to be blown up at the barracks. That's what they tell me. For Old Peace-and-Quiet, you know a lot of things. - Come with me. - Where? To the attic. The Marmont barracks garage is the big black square next to the buildings. Yes, I think so. That's where the explosion will be. How did you do it? I'll explain it to you. If I could tell... It's past time. - If Pelletier— - What did you say? What's happening? - You're cold. - It's nothing, Dad. Poor thing; I've gotten you mixed up in things not meant for you. Let's go back downstairs, you're frozen. - Something's gone wrong. - What are you afraid of? I don't know. Everything. War is terrible. Yes it is. But the men blown up there could have stayed home. We didn't ask them to come here. Who is this woman? The cleaning lady, she just broke a bottle of ink. He said to hurry, we need to use the office right away. German Police Moissan Factory Special shipment Sunday, June 20 Sunday, June 20 Sunday, June 20 Sunday, June 20 Hello. So, you're loading up? Got a big shipment yesterday. You're up early today! I was looking for you last night. - Why? - Oh, just to visit. Sunday, June 20 Sunday, June 20 Looks like your information was right. They're really gearing up there. - It's all for Sunday. - Sounds impossible. Yes, but it's true. You see? They're building a sort of raised dock. - Is it for trans-shipment? - You can see the plan. From Germany to here by train, then move them by truck west to the beaches. I read a report on it. It's a sort of big torpedo with a cabin in the middle. A sort of Nautilus, with 2 men inside. A dirty trick! It'll badly affect the Normandy operation. They'll put hundreds of them in the water. If we can't slow them down a bit. They'll need a ton of trucks to move that. Yes, probably. It's as big as a pocket submarine? Or a dozen— OH! - What is it? - I see it. They've already got one. That's it! A pocket submarine. That pipeline of yours is the best! Take a look, quick, on the left. They're moving it on a rail. See it? Nice cigar! You can see the glass cupola on top for the pilot for diving. Is it glass? It's a sort of plexiglass. Go back to your source. See if it's really Sunday the cigar box will be full. If it is, we'll tell London right away? Of course. You called me, Dad? Yes, close the door. I got a reply from London. And? They're bombing the factory Sunday night at 10 PM. We have to save our neighbors no matter what. We've racked our brains, and I have an idea. It's not great, but we have no choice. We're going to fake a family celebration. We're going to fake your engagement. Sunday night we'll invite all our neighbors to the Coq Hardi 4 km away. You won't be compromised; when it's all over, we'll explain it to everyone. But will they all come? They all love a party, they'll all come, I'm sure of that. Charrat won't; you're fighting with him. Charrat will be fine. So, you can be engaged to one of them, maybe Simon? It's a sudden engagement because your fiancé has to leave, etc. Whatever you say, Dad. No objections, Simon, Pelletier? I'm afraid some people in town know I'm already married. My wife's in Dakar, but still— Well, it doesn't matter; how about you, Pelletier? Maybe it would be better for me to play the role. - You can make the sacrifice. - I wouldn't say that. So it doesn't bother you? Whatever you say, Chief. You're not already engaged? No. Didn't you tell me you already had 2 children out of wedlock? No, I didn't. Sorry, I must have mixed you up with someone else. And that's not a problem with you, dear? No, since it's to save our neighbors. You also make the sacrifice. Then I'll go tell your mother. You watch, she'll say we should hold it here, nice and comfy! Madeleine! I've got the feeling he's pulling your leg. - Well, let me wish you joy. - Thank you! The play's about to start. I have some good news to tell you. I'm coming. What's wrong, Mom? "I'm joining the underground..." It's Pierre. "At least there will be one family member in the Resistance." Silly lad! What did you want to tell me? Jean and I are engaged. You're in love? I never know what's going on. You said it! No. Sorry, but I refuse. Come on, Charrat, you're not going to treat my daughter like that. I like a quiet life. Sunday it'll be quieter there than... Don't talk nonsense. And it's not just that. Have you forgotten we're fighting? No, no, my neighbors are all my friends. - They're all coming, I'm inviting you. - I refuse. You cheat me of my rights, and now— Hang on, the surveyor said I was right. That piece of land is mine! You can have it then, as long as you come to Monique's engagement party. Really? You give in? Yes, but I want everyone at my daughter's engagement. - Grandma too. - Why, she's over 82! Why not? What an idea! Yes, I'm coming! Your apprentice too. I want everyone. Everyone's coming from the Vimonts and the Renaults. The maid, the grandpa, everyone. Grandpa? That old fool? Yes, I want everyone. Martin, you're a good fellow. I'm not so bad. Thank you for your sense of duty in carrying out your mission. - Dad? - Yes, dear? I want to ask you something. Could our engagement be more than make-believe? Silly. It never was make-believe for me. Where do you think you are? At our engagement party! - Not a very good dinner, eh? - It's all your fault. It's far away and it's bad. He wanted us all to come here? Yes. We could have sat under the chestnut tree in the garden. Have you had any news of your son? No. I think of him all the time, I'm very worried. It's odd that Simon isn't here. He's late; he's very busy these days with insurance. He's very busy with Martin and Pelletier. Yes, they have a lot of work. - Where's Simon? - Here he is. You made it at last! The last German train arrived at 9:00 exactly. I hope our friends will hurry tonight. It's almost 10:00; I hope they're not late. That box has a good 30 cigars in it. Simon! A song! Here they come again. If only they get the Boche! Look, there are the others. It's terrifying. Down into the cellar, folks. This way. Edouard! - They're dropping bombs! - It's the factory. I've lost him! - Who have you lost? - My cat. Hurry. We have to go down, Simon, it's getting serious. Help Pelletier look after the women. My poor orchids! Right on time? Oh, it's you! Are you coming? They're hitting the factory; lucky we're not there. But I'm fine with it. How's that? I've got a sharp nose. It picks up a lot. I said last week that you're a good fellow. You're a lot more than that. And I'm an old scoundrel to accept your piece of land. It's OK, I'm giving it back. I'm your old friend. It's OK, I may seem like an old lunatic. We'll talk about it after the war. Thank you for telling me that. Thank you. It's the factory, eh? Bullseye. All the affected buildings... these lightly damaged, here completely destroyed. Not many French houses struck. Just Martin's greenhouse... you know, the orchids. Kaput! These'll take a bit longer than 8 years to grow. Concerning that gentleman, I have a few words to say. No victims in the general population? That's what I want to focus on. The locals were warned because no one was in those homes. They were at the engagement party. Whose engagement? Miss Martin's. Martin, strike one. - It could be a coincidence. - I don't believe it! Martin was with Jourdan the night he disappeared. Martin, strike two. Martin, strike three. He was in my office when that fool came to tell me the fuel trucks were delayed. Now? I'm off, they're coming to arrest me. Warn Pelletier as soon as you can. Meet tomorrow at the usual place. Take this to your room quickly and burn it. - You're leaving like this? - I have to. Go back to your mother. Good evening, Mr. Martin. You're taking a little walk? We'll go together, to the Commandant's office. Edouard, where are you? I told you, I don't have the key! Let me out! No need to shout like that. The Americans are at Maintenon. Will you let me out before they get to Paris? - I don't have the key. - Who does? The Lieutenant. He's not back from the Beaurepaire raid. And they left me out! Come on, it's for your own good. You'd want to go, and you don't know how to fight. Oh yeah? Last Tuesday, who blew up the munitions truck? Yeah, and you almost took the rest of us with it! I didn't come here to get stuck with these pigs. Shut up! What are they doing at Beaurepaire? Attacking a convey to rescue some parachutists who might be shot. I hear a car. They're here! Quick! Are they hurt bad? We'll see. Take him in. You were a long time; we were worried. We attacked at 11:30 and were still there at 12. Did you get the men at least? Yes, but when we surrounded them the Boche tried to kill them. They got one; the other 2 are breathing. We brought them all. One guy isn't a parachutist; he's about 60. So you don't have the key, eh? Jerk! Nothing I can do, he's got 3 bullets in the stomach. Dead? That makes 2 out of 3. He's coming through. English. He parachuted in day before yesterday. What about the other one? Will the old guy make it? It's touch and go with him. He took the full blast in his leg. His heart's a bit weak. Bring him out. Find a room. At the baker's? The old guy wasn't a parachutist. - He's the head of a cell. - You're sure? Yes, I know him, he's from Moissan, his name's... I'm from Moissan. Move aside, give him air! Keep the sun off. What did you say his name was? Dupont, or Dubois, I think. Martin? Yes, Martin. You said he's a leader? Yes, the top leader for everyone. What's wrong? You're crying? He's my father. He's my father! So you don't want to be mayor? Not a chance! Berlin has fallen! Yes, I know. It's all over! Why don't you want to be mayor? I didn't fight to score points. We fought to kick them out. Not to have them on our backs any more. And now the French will all come together. - You think so? - Let's hope so. At our last card game people were almost at each other's throats. - Already? - It caused a rift. Pierre, Mom doesn't have your ration card. Give it to her. What's all this fuss? In a week we won't be using cards anymore. The Allies will send us boatloads of provisions. Here's your mail. Do I give her the card or not? Give it to her, sometimes the seas are rough. Tax bill... I'll look at that later. Now this is what I've been waiting for. Go get my glasses, I want to read this right away. "Next season's flowers" Edouard! Come take your pill!
