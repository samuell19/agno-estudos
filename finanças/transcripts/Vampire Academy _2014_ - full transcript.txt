(M.I.A. "BAD GIRLS") - (SONG CONTINUING OVER STEREO) - GIRL: Oh, Father, turn it up. Please, Mr. Dragomir, I love this song. This song is sick... the traditional "vomit" definition of the word. Shut up, Andre. Me and Rose want to hear it. "Rose and I," Lissa, "Rose and I." - I think the tune is rather catchy. - (TIRES SCREECHING) (GASPS, SIGHS) - (MUFFLED CRYING) - Lissa? - (CRYING) - Lissa. Hey, Lissa, wake up. - yöu're having a bad dream. - (SIGHS) It wasn't a dream. I know. The accident. Sorry. Not again. yöu know, ever since that night, I still can't get used to it. yöu being in my head, it's so weird. yöu should know by now, with us, "weird" doesn't begin to cover it. Why can't yöu be like a normal teenage girl and dream about hot, naked guys on unicorns? Does it have to be unicorns? Of course not. It could be Jet Skis, mechanical bulls or... Why do yöu have a scary poster of an American ex-president? Well, yöu told me I needed to blend more into Oregano society. We're in Oregon. yöu know yöu're completely hopeless as a human being, right? I'm still adjusting, Rose. It's been less than a year since we ran away from the academy, two years since the crash. Don't yöu ever stop to think about everything that we've gone through? Stopping is for losers. I only think about keeping us moving and keeping yöu safe. Does anyone even remember us? yöu really think the academy's still trying to hunt us down? Absolutely. I think we may have to get plastic surgery. No, don't, please. - Yes? No? - (LAUGHING) No. - Just like this? yöu like it? - Rose, no. - Whoa. When was the last time yöu...? - I'm not hungry. Is exactly what yöu say every time yöu're hungry. Come to the kitchen. I'll make yöur favorite. Are yöu... are yöu sure about this? Bon appétit. - Thanks. - What are friends for? - (CAT MEOWS) - yöu jealous, Oscar? What are yöu looking at? Do I still have anything on my...? Lissa, smile. They're watching. Not a drill. - What's out there? Not Strigoi? - No, not Strigoi, thank God. Guardians. Keep close, just like we practiced. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (WHISPERS) Lissa, go. - (MOTOR REVVING) - (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (SHOUTING) (GRUNTING) (ALARM CHIRPS) - Did yöu have to hurt them? - Did I have to hurt them? yöu're welcome. Get out the map, Gandhi. We'll head north into Canada. - (OSCAR MEOWS) - Did yöu really bring that fur ball? I couldn't just abandon him. (GASPS) (GRUNTING) Hells, yes. Rose. Princess Vasilisa Dragomir. My name is Dimitri Belikov. I've come to take yöu back to St. Vladimir's Academy. Listen, comrade, to get to her, yöu're gonna have to go through me. ROSE: Like I said, "weird" doesn't begin to cover it. My best friend Lissa Dragomir is a royal member of a magical, ancient "Race" the Moroi. The Moroi don't wear black capes, turn into bats or sleep in coffins. Daylight annoys yet doesn't kill them, and they don't sparkle, either. But, yes, like most creatures with fangs, the Moroi live off blood. But they don't live forever, that's why they need us. (GASPS) My name is Rose Hathaway and like these other guys, I'm a Dhampir. We're the protectors, the guardians. Only half Moroi, I can eat a bacon cheeseburger or whatever else I want. Dhampir lives are dedicated to protecting the Moroi. We live by one simple "Expression" they come first. Only nothing's ever simple. Handcuffs? There's got to be a compliment in there somewhere. So yöu're taking us back to the academy. Tell me, how bad is it gonna be? Nothing? yöu know, I kept the princess safe and hidden for an entire year before yöu got lucky. - Congratulations. - It speaks. Wow, that's a lot of molnija marks yöu got there. yöu've killed six Strigoi? We were afraid that we'd run into one of them back there. If yöu had run into a Strigoi, we wouldn't be having this conversation. This is yöur idea of a conversation? (LAUGHS) Exactly. (ROSE AND LISSA LAUGHING) DIMITRI: We are here. Open the gate. Anyone there? (RADIO CRACKLING) Where is everyone? - (LISSA SCREAMS) - (GRUNTING) (SNARLS, SCREAMS) - Let's go! - Lissa! Move, move! (GRUNTING AND SNARLING) Stay in the car. - (SNARLS) - (MAN SCREAMS) - (GRUNTING AND SNARLING) - (MAN SCREAMING) No! (MAN SCREAMING) (GRUNTING) DIMITRI: I've got this one. Stay here. What's going on out there? Stay here. (RUSTLING) (SNARLING) (GRUNTING) - (GASPS) - (SNARLS) (GRUNTING) - (BONES CRACK) - (GROANS) (SNARLING) (SCREAMING) (GRUNTING) (SCREAMING) (GASPS) DIMITRI: Spiridon. Welcome back, Dimitri. ROSE: And then there's group number "Three" the bad vampires, the Strigoi. Evil bloodsuckers that only come out at night and can only be killed by a silver stake. It takes five of our best to kill one of their worst. If yöu're lucky, they'll just rip yöu apart, but they can also turn yöu into one of them. Strigoi were the true monsters of our nightmares. For all the stories, the warnings, and the training films, I had never seen one up close. - (HISSES) - (GASPS) I told yöu to stay in the car. We're clear. ROSE: And there it was. Goodbye, Facebook. Goodbye, iPhone 5. Hello, St. Vladimir's. It is not just another school. It's another universe. Moroi and Dhampir students come from all over the world to study history, science, math, and all the other boring stuff, but around fourth period, we Dhampir go off and learn fun new ways to maim and kill, while, for the Moroi, it's magic time. Water, earth, fire, air. yöu see, it's not just their diet that makes the Moroi special, and some are more special than others. Our secret society has its own government that alternates leaders from 12 royal families. That's Queen Tatiana up top, but my girl Lissa is in the mix. yöu can see why the princess leaving the academy was such a scandal, and me helping her was worse. Damn, back to Vampire Academy. Please don't say Vampire Academy. yöu know how I feel about the "V" word. Sorry. It's not like the drinking of blood is yöur main source of sustenance. No, wait, that's exactly what it is. - (LAUGHS) - (SCHOOL BELL RINGS) They just had to bring us back in the middle of the night. So not cool... 1:00 a.m., end of fifth period. Ew, it looks like Aaron's tried to replace yöu with a little keychain version. God, I hate high school. Princess. Headmistress Kirova is ready for yöu. Come on. It's all so unprecedented. I'm at a loss coming up with proper punishment. As Lissa's guardian... yöu're not an official guardian, Hathaway. yöu are a novice. yöu put Vasilisa at the mercy of the Strigoi, who would love to destroy, or even worse, transform... It was my idea to leave. Rose only did what... KIROVA: A trained guardian knows... - (DOOR OPENS) - MAN: Ellen, please. - Victor. - Lissa. VICTOR: Ah. ROSE: Prince Dashkov, yöu look so... Yes. My Sandovsky's syndrome has gotten worse. Oh, Victor, we never meant to worry yöu. Headmistress, these girls have been through so much. As provost of this school and Lissa's father's oldest friend, I beg yöu, look into yöur heart. Vasilisa, I have the utmost sympathy for the loss of yöur parents and yöur brother, Andre. But why did yöu flee a heavily guarded compound of Moroi students from all over the world? It's not easy to explain. Lissa felt more in danger here in yöur secure environment than on the outside as an anonymous teenager. Fascinating. This is where yöu give me specifics. Where's Ms. Karp? She should be here. She can maybe shed some light onto the situation. Ms. Karp is no longer part of this institution. I... This is where yöu give me specifics. What do yöu mean? It's not important! Vasilisa Dragomir is from one of the 12 royal families. She's the last of the Dragomir line. With my condition taking the Dashkov family out of contention, Lissa is a possible successor to the throne. But yöu, Hathaway, a Dhampir girl cut off from the community, out on civilian streets without a dime or a Social Security number? "Blood whore" is such an ugly term, but I'm sure Moroi men on business trips would pay a lot for the especially sweet taste. Headmistress Kirova. - They have the bond. - That's... that's impossible. In my brief observation period, Rose could tell what Lissa was thinking or feeling, sometimes without being in the same place. What a rare and wonderful gift. This doesn't take away from the fact that Rose Hathaway is wild, dangerous... - insubordinate, vulgar. - Right here, folks. Right here. But the number of female Dhampir guardians has gone down way too much to risk losing one with such potential. Ellen, what this impressive new guardian says seems reasonable. We're so sorry, Headmistress. After the crash, I lacked a strong parental figure to confide in. I'm afraid Rose and I got in way over our heads. Two crazy kids. Hathaway can stay, but no extracurricular activities, no parties, no socializing, nothing resembling fun. Take the princess to her royal quarters and find a broom closet for... Oh, Rose, I almost forgot. A telegram. From Mom. ROSE: Kirova flipping out and Lissa using compulsion to save my ass, just another night at St. Vladimir's. Wow. This place definitely brought back memories. Come on, over here. LISSA: Before the accident, my father used to say that for a Moroi not declaring a magic is like not going through puberty. Yeah, and he also used to say practice during the day while the world, yöur world, is sleeping. Let's make some magic. Perfect. Fire and water. That's my Moroi. - Rose... - Don't leave me hanging. Rose, yöu know how I feel about high-fives. Ladies. It's after 11:00 a.m., girls. yöu should be in bed. The sun has cleared the trees, and it won't be kind, yöur Highness. I never got a chance to express my condolences at the funeral. But I am so heartened by the extraordinary recovery yöu've both made. (LAUGHS) And don't worry, Princess. I never officially declared a magic, either. And look how I turned out. Ms. Karp's so different from the other instructors. It's really refreshing. The thing that I like the most about her is she's not strange or creepy at all. (CROW CAWING) (GASPS) - It's hurt. - It's more than hurt. It's done. Leave it. Come on, let... (CAWING) That was unique. Lissa. Lissa? (CROWD CHATTERING) (SCHOOL BELL RINGING) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (GASPS, COUGHS) (LAUGHTER) Hey, Liss. - It's good to see yöu. - Aaron. Guessing yöur new girlfriend practices water magic. Classy. Yeah. Hey, I'm sorry. Mia gets jealous, but deep down, she's sweet. Back off, bitch. He's mine now. Very deep down, apparently. How does it feel to leave at the top and come back at the bottom? Don't like what I'm saying? What are yöu gonna do about it? Thanks for asking. I'm gonna go to a quiet place and be very depressed that this is my new life. (GRUNTING) MAN OVER SPEAKER: All Dhampir novices transfer to the next training station. Everyone transfer to their next training station. BOY: Dimitri is a God. I hear he tracked them down to Oregon, and when Rose tried to put up a fight, he handed her her ass. And what was left of that ass got chewed up by Headmistress Kirova. Surely, yöu have something more interesting to discuss than my ass. - yöur boobies? - Quit while yöu're alive, Mason. What up, baby? BOTH: Ooh. Forgot the secret handshake. That hurts. yöu know, I'm gonna make yöu pay for yöur booby comment. Old Rose maybe, but yöu've missed a year of training. Yeah, yöu needed that year to catch up with what I was born with. Prepare to... Ow! (GROANS) Sorry, Rose. Don't hate me. I'd hate yöu more if yöu held back. They have these things in the outside world... Pinkberry and mini taquitos, Toaster Strudel... (SIGHS) Oh, no. Not this again. (PANTING) (RAPID FOOTSTEPS) - (DOOR CLOSES) - (GASPS) Don't worry. I don't bite. Well... only literally. What are yöu doing here? This is where I come to get away. Hey, this was my... special place before it was yöur special place. What do yöu have to get away from, Princess? What do yöu know about pain? Break a nail off in yöur tiara? - Excuse me, after a car crash... - yöu got off easy. How dare yöu! Do yöu have any idea what it's like to lose yöur family? (SOFTLY) Oh. Sorry. yöu know yöu're talking to Christian Ozera, right? Parents transformed themselves into Strigoi... When yöur folks died, there was a pretty funeral, and everybody cried. When my mother and father were hunted down, everybody cheered. I hate what they chose to become... but they were still my parents. A Strigoi can't enter holy ground. Is that why yöu come to the church? To prove to everyone yöu haven't turned? Get away from that freak. (FRUSTRATED GRUNT) Maybe I just like the way the moonlight hits this spot. It's as if yöu're on another planet. What was it like... outside the academy? It was kind of scary, just the two of us out there, but... it was also kind of great. No one knew who I was. It does sound kind of great. But what did yöu do for blood? I mean, it's not like yöu can pick it up at 7-Eleven. Or so I've read. Don't yöu say anything, girl. People will get the wrong idea. yöu and Rose, all alone on the road. I have my theories. Promise me yöu won't tell yöur friends these theories. I promise yöu I have no friends to tell. ROSE: Stop staring at each other all... - ...gooey like. (GASPS) - Hathaway! Look alive! Comrade Belikov. They ran me ragged. What do yöu say we go easy today? - Perhaps discuss a bit of theory. - Of course, Rose. I understand. (ROSE GRUNTS) How do yöu say "what a dick" in Russian? Did yöu even go to a gym out there? I took a couple of spinning classes. Do yöu really think beating me up is gonna help me face a live Strigoi? After yöur performance last night, if yöu see a Strigoi, I recommend running. Now, give me ten sets of lines. yöu know, this country has a concept called "positive reinforcement." Rose, yöur bond is special. yöu're an ideal choice to guard Vasilisa when yöu both graduate. But if yöu want to be with her, yöu need to be ready for anything. (ROSE YELLS) - Ow! - Wow. yöu look how I feel. I look how I feel. How's that "under the radar" plan working out, Highness? Not so much. If yöu need a shoulder to cry on, use mine, not Christian Ozera's. - Who told yöu? - I was sort of... yöu know, there. Oh, not again. That's so gross. I know, and it was, like, the longest one yet. - yöu seriously can't turn it off? - I don't know. Have yöu ever seen me go to the bathroom? No, but thank yöu for giving me something to look forward to. - Oh, shut up. Oh! - (ALARM VIBRATES) No wonder I'm so cranky. I'm starving. ROSE: And now, for the obligatory cafeteria scene, sort of. Ever wonder what happened to that friend of yöurs, obsessed with vampire books and shows? It's called the human feeder program. Human civilians systematically giving their blood. I forgot how much I did not miss this. LISSA: Hey, no feeder is brought here against their will. They can leave any time that they want to. Yeah, it's just a one-year service limit, and their memories are officially compulsed upon departure. That's completely normal. LISSA: Don't feel too sorry for the feeders. If yöu recall, the bitee does get something out of the process. - (GASPS) Oh, there's Norrine. Here. - Hey! Look at yöu! - How are yöu? - Yeah, good. - (YOWLING) - Here. (SIGHS) OK. Rose! Come and keep a decrepit man company. Decrepit? yöu're just saying that so I won't kick yöur ass in five-card draw. Tell me, my darling, while yöu were gone, did Lissa get any closer to declaring? There's not a lot of places to practice magic in Portland. Oh, true, true. On the subject of non-declarers, I want to know why, when I brought up Ms. Karp's name yesterday, yöu all acted like I put a porcupine in a hot tub. Karp has always been a few corpuscles shy of a full artery. She didn't have a Dhampir to look after her. I know yöu have yöur special bond with Lissa, but it makes yöur escape that much more alarming. I'm on yöur side, Rose, but we live in a world where the bogeymen are real. I know. I'm still a little freaked-out. I was there last night when that Strigoi attacked, and I just... I totally choked. Don't be so down on yöurself, Rose. - Why are yöu... - (CLATTERING) I know yöu have yöur life mission to protect Lissa, but would yöu now and again look out for my Natalie? ROSE: Mm... She's a goofball, but I do cherish her. Yes. Well, she worships her father. She would do anything for yöu. I must go to her. - Hey. - (OSCAR MEOWS) (SIGHS) Hi. - Do I have anything... - (GROANS) Just fat-lady feeder breath. Here. So, do yöu even know yöur feeders? Norrine's recently divorced, and she's catching up on some me-time. She writes Twilight fan-fiction. - Have yöu read any of it? - Oh, God, no. Rose, Princess Vasilisa. I mean, Lissa. yöu said I could call yöu Lissa, but if I can't anymore, - that's totally fine. - Hello, Natalie. By the soul of St. Vlad's, so much has happened. Nothing bigger than yöur escape, of course. Why did yöu escape? Did yöu hear Sheila Flight and Bruce Bugsburger broke up? Apparently, Bruce still has his baby fangs, and it freaks Sheila out. And yöu know about Tess and Jackson? Each was afraid that they're gonna be the ones to get dumped, so they started this really weird rumor. I can't really remember... Natalie? Do yöu take gossip requests? Mia Rinaldi over there, is she new? Well, she's been around, but new haircut, new fangs, and now she's hanging out with all the royals. Rose Hathaway, what are yöu doing here? Surely yöu would not deprive a girl of her religious needs? Just get inside. The debate team, and I don't really know if I... Speaking of extracurricular activities that I miss, is that Jesse? The hot get hotter. Yeah, Jesse's still the academy's number one wet dreamboat. (SCOFFS) He has a terrible personality. Jesse has a personality? I didn't know. Don't judge a book by its content. yöu know this is a church, right? Gosh, if only there was a way that we could set up a double date with Ray over there. yöu can't tell me that there's no inbreeding amongst yöu royals. Exhibit Ray. Ray just doesn't know how to express his feelings. yöu know, when a boy throws sand in a girl's face, it really means that... Never mind. Yeah. - yöur friend's a tool. - Don't change the subject. yöu, me... yöu and me. Yeah, but don't yöu have a girlfriend? - Probably. - Oh, yöu are bad. What's so bad about bad? (CHURCH BELLS TOLLING) (CHUCKLES) yöu do understand, Rose, that even the walls of a church can't protect a true sinner from a good lightning bolt? Save a seat for me in the Dhampir section, yöu dork. Mason likes yöu so much. Why can't yöu go outwith a nice, funny guy like him? I know. If only I could put Mason into Jesse's body. God can be cruel. Yes. That's true. Come on. Let's go. MAN: Following God's path is never easy. Even St. Vladimir had difficulty controlling and understanding his powers. But he was bound to a loving Dhampir guardian who always knew what was in his heart and mind. Shadow-kissed Anna. Shadow-kissed Rose, yöu're bound to Lissa, and it's up to yöu to help her. (EXPLOSION) (CONGREGATION GASPING) (GASPS) (LAUGHTER) What's so funny? Did yöu write that? Down, Dhampir, yöu saw me in church. Listen, Gap Kids, if I find out that yöu had anything to do with that, I will rip yöur... yöu'll what? yöu're on lockdown. yöu breathe the wrong way and yöu're out on the pavement doing amateur blood whore porn. Listen up, that's enough excitement for a Sunday night. Everyone back to yöur dorms until further notice. Royal rec room, high noon. I've changed my mind. I'm feeling bad. Good. (GOLDFRAPP "THEA") (SIGHS) We Moroi may not burst into flames like Strigoi, but daylight still stings. Poor thing. (CHUCKLES) Did yöu have jobs out in the world? What about an iPhone? - What's a hashtag? - Please, stop talking. Whoa, horsey, what do yöu think yöu're doing? Come on, Rose. A bite while yöu're going at it is the best. Stop it! Oh... I know that look. yöu've done it before. I would never let a guy degrade me like that. Not a guy, of course. Lissa. We've all been wondering how she fed. Once yöu've had fang, Rose, yöu never go... Daytime fraternization. Forbidden. I get it. Chill, chill. Again, Jesse? Back to yöur room! What? (GASPS) (CREAKING) Lissa, what are yöu doing? (GASPS) - (LISSA SCREAMING) - (GASPS) - Rose? - Lissa's in trouble. (CRYING) (STAMMERS) I heard... I heard a noise. (WHISPERING) Lissa... There's so much blood. It's starting again, isn't it? I tried, Rose, I tried to bring it back, but... it was too late. - Get over here and comfort her, jerk. - (MEOWS) It's gonna be OK. - What the hell is Kirova doing? - She's giving Vasilisa a sedative, and we are increasing her guardian detail. Our security system is geared to keeping Strigoi out, not dealing with teenage bullying within. Bullying? yöu really think that's all this is? - Rose... - Sorry. Thank yöu for not saying anything to Kirova about... it was foolish of me to assume yöu'd be above such 17-year-old silliness. Hmm. Hmm... (INHALING) The sunlight, it's nice. I miss it. Stupid vampire timetable. The little sacrifices we make. And the big ones. My 17-year-old silliness, that was the past. That was an hour ago. Are yöu trying to tell me yöu're suddenly mature and responsible? I'm trying to tell yöu that I want to be, I have to be. Teach me something more than doing laps. I know enough about running away. And next time we meet, teach me how to fight. (SCHOOL BELL RINGING) (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Pipe down. Let's pick up where we left off. After the tribunals in Romania... Mia! yöu're usually a lot better at passing on notes. - Having an off-day? - Oh, no, Mr. Meisner, please don't read this note out loud, I beg of yöu. "I'll bet that drama queen..." "I mean, drama princess, killed that fox herself" "to distract the school from her real secret." Don't go on. Mr. Meisner, yöu're being used as a tool to broadcast Mia's vile propaganda. Are yöu calling me a tool? - If she's not, I will. - What was that, Hathaway? Now I'm curious. "So, it turns out the reason" "that Lissa survived so long on the outside" "is she used Rose as a personal feed bag." - (STUDENTS MURMURING) - Settle down! Dhampir-Moroi mastication is a very serious allegation. I'm gonna pretend I never read this. Everyone turn to page three of yöur handout. RAY: But, Mr. Meisner, yöu left out the best part. About me and my boy, Jesse, and that Dhamp tramp last night. - What? - Truth hurts, blood whore. (STUDENTS MURMURING) (SHRIEKING, GASPING) Christian, cut it out! Kindly report to Headmistress Kirova's office, Mr. Ozera. - Down the hall, turn left. - Like I need directions. - (SCHOOL BELL RINGING) - Lissa, Lissa, wait up. Not here, not in front of everyone. What was that back there? Fire magic in class? - Uh..oh. Lovers' quarrel. - Rose, I bleed for yöu. No, it's Rose who does the bleeding. (GRUNTING) yöu can't beat up everyone we have a problem with! - Well, I can try. - What is going on? I told yöu, Jesse and I barely even made out, and Ray wasn't even there, so I don't even know what he's talking about. OK, yes. Teenage boys are weak and sweaty piglets. It is our covenant... I'm talking about yöu and me. How did they find out about the feeding? yöu know, when Jesse's fangs came poking out, did yöu... No, not even. But... he did kind of suspect. Lissa, let me explain, please! Let me talk... Is it true? yöu're gonna have to be more specific, Mason. Jesse and Ray, and not just hooking up, fanging up. - They claim they fed while... - Absolutely not... Well, actually, Jesse and I did make out a little, but... - Where there's smoke, there's fire. - Leave fire out of this. yöu girls throw yöurselves at any douche bag who happens to be Moroi and royal. Whoa, Duckie. I do not have time to deal with yöur feelings right now. - OK. - (STAMMERING) Oh, God, come on, Lissa-vision. Where are yöu when I need yöu? yöu should thank me for changing the news cycle. It took something epic to take animal death and blood whoring off the Vampire Academy front page. Please don't say "Vampire Academy." I find the term to be quite... yöu set someone on fire! Come on. Did yöu see any burn marks on him? Now whoever killed that fox is going to feel the real heat. Is this yöur idea of chivalry? yöu did not just flip yöur hair back. That's yöur move. She's flirting, folks. If we used our magic as a weapon, instead of just for warm and fuzzy classroom exercises, the Strigoi wouldn't be picking us off. - Yes, but the rules forbid... - The rules? Lissa, I've seen the way yöu tilt yöur head from time to time. I'm very sure I don't know what yöu're talking about. Hey, compulsion must have been a necessity in the outside world. yöu can't know all my secrets. Yet. - (FANFARE PLAYING) - Queen Tatiana? (APPLAUSE) I hope I did not take yöu too much by surprise, but sometimes yöur queen awakens with a need to look upon her lovelies. Where's Vasilisa? Vasilisa Dragomir? Please come up and let me see the princess. Not a day goes by where we don't lament the loss of yöur parents and yöur brother. The Dragomir name represents the finest of Moroi qualities. While yöu, Vasilisa Dragomir, the last of the Dragomir line... if yöu are our future, I am less than impressed. The power that comes from royal blood must be used responsibly. While yöu... yöu give us dead animals, blood games, escapes to Oregon. Shameful! - Queen Tatiana, I can explain. - Shh, shh, shh. Not now, dear. However, I have every confidence that our dear Vasilisa will turn things around. Now, let us adjourn to the banquet hall. NATALIE: My father would never have done something like that. After all that Lissa has been through, to be shamed by our queen bee? Don't yöu mean queen bee-etch? yöu don't talk to Lissa like that. So much for round-the-clock guardians. Lissa? Oh, my God. - NATALIE: By the soul of St. Vladimir. - Who would do something like this? Why? Go to the wall, Nat. Talk to me. - What? - (GRUNTS) Yeah, OK. (WHISPERING) Oh, God. - It's fresh, and it's Moroi. - OK, can yöu tell me if it's royal? - (SCOFFS) Don't be absurd. - Said the girl licking the wall. I can tell yöu it's more than one person's blood. - (DOOR SLAMS) - They misspelled "beware." Lissa, I can clean it up. I'm sorry. Leave it. The misspelling shows it was just a bunch of stupid teenagers. OK, yöu know what, I'm gonna go start packing. I'm really... No, Rose. We can't just keep running away, at least until we know what we're running away from. Ooh! A mystery, how exciting. We can be like three Nancy Drews trying... I hate mysteries. I would prefer a good Strigoi attack at this point because at least I'd know what those homicidal bloodsuckers want. No more. I am taking our dear beloved queen's advice, and I'm turning things around. Jesse and Ray are pawns. Mia is the mastermind. Yeah, but we didn't even really know Mini-Mia when we were compelled to leave for the first time. Ms. Karp is the one that we should be focused on. Do what yöu have to do, Dhampir. I am done trying to crawl under the radar. It's not possible, and... it's not effective. (OSCAR MEOWS) Besides, I have a way of getting people to see my side of the story. Don't worry, Natalie knows of my skills. It was too exhausting keeping it from her. Are yöu going to use compulsion on Mia? Where's the fun in that? I'm going to use compulsion on everyone but Mia. But compulsion on such a large scale... Magic should be used for something more than warm and fuzzy classroom exercises. Oh, God, and now yöu're quoting Christian? - What? - Yeah, I was there. And the poison that that freak is pumping into yöur brain makes me want to vomit. Lissa, I'm the reckless, and yöu're the cautious, remember? yöu've already taken too many hits for me, Rose. Look, it's yöur turn to have a little cry, and it's my turn to kick a little ass. Whoa! yöu do not jump out at a guardian like that. I think yöu mean novice. Just wanted to know if Lissa was all right. Queen Tatiana had no right to bring up family. - I should go and talk to Lissa. - Oh, don't worry about it. But I do. Lissa and I have a bond. A bond? Listen, Chris, just stay away from her. She's had her little flirtation with the dark side, and she's done. Lissa used to like Hot Topic, too, and then she turned 12. I was only concerned. There's a fine line between concerned and stalker. Seriously, Christian, go away. It's what Lissa wants. (BIRDS TWITTERING) OK. I thought we'd practice out here, away from there. Dimitri, I know yöu must have heard some rumors. All that high-school der'mo stays back there, not here. This is life and death. The silver. Don't be afraid of it. Besides the sun, this stake is yöur only friend against the Strigoi. But yöu must subdue the monster and bring yöurself to kill. Yeah, killing Strigoi is what it's all about, right? Most Strigoi were once Moroi. Some turn themselves Strigoi by killing during the feeding process. But many are turned by force. If yöu are going to thrust, thrust. My point is yöu might have known one personally, as a friend. Can yöu kill someone yöu used to know? I... If it was them or me or Lissa... yöu hesitate, and that hesitation could kill yöu. yöu have to keep telling yöurself that they aren't the same people yöu knew. Good. Very good. I don't mean to belittle what yöu are going through. The queen crossed a line. But the Dhampir must always bow down. I get it. The Moroi come first. Not always. My father was a Moroi. He visited Russia once a year. He liked to hit my mother. When I was old enough, I liked to hit him. He stopped visiting. - How old is old enough? - Ten. (CHUCKLES) The only parent I've ever really had is the academy. yöur mother is one of the most feared and respected Dhampir guardians in the world. I see yöu finally read her telegram. yöu want to know what it said? "Glad yöu're alive. What yöu did was inexcusable. Mom." Aw. What do yöu know of yöur Moroi father? That he must have had dark eyes and amazing hair. When I start killing Strigoi left and right, I'm gonna have to cut it all off, won't I? Sorry. That sounded really girly. yöu can wear it up. Doesn't a Dhampir need to keep their molnija marks exposed? Don't ever cut yöur hair. Wear it up. yöu have to admire our queen. Her elegance, her dignity, her ability to recognize trash. And my good mood is over. yöu know, "beware" isn't spelled with an "H" in it. - Hey. - Where's Lissa? I haven't seen her, but guess what? I heard that Mia and Aaron are going on that field trip to the hemoglobin factory. I figured it gives us a chance to raid their rooms... - Pretend to be talking to me. - But I am talking to yöu. It's nasty. If yöu guys were doing it, I'm not surprised Rose got addicted and necked with Jesse. She didn't do it with Jesse. And it's not like we fornicated. We just didn't have any feeders. It's no big deal, Camilla. Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, Jesse's a liar. What are yöu guys doing tonight? Shannon and I are going to her room to study for Meisner's test. Invite me. Lissa, yöu want to study with us tonight? LISSA: Sure. Oh, look. It's the queen's court jester. yöu can't talk to me like that. The queen treats me like a daughter, so yöu should be envious. yöu're buds with Mia. What secrets are yöu keeping? - I like to wear my mommy's knick... - Not about yöu. Secrets about Mia. - LISSA: Busted. - Ow. Did yöu witness how amazing I was? I felt it. Using the power has an effect, a cost, on both of us. Look at yöu, yöu're shaking. I'm shaking. Three cups of coffee shaking. More like 18 cups, dark roast, no room. - I got it, the computer. - What? I told yöu. Mia's on a field trip... Hey, yöu. I'm sorry I haven't been to church in a while, but... It's OK. yöu don't have to pretend anymore. yöu've had yöur little flirtation with the dark side. - Check that box and move on. - What are yöu talking about? But, hey, nice hypocrisy on the magic use. - (POP MUSIC PLAYING) - LISSA: So what? A stolen laptop. Kirova strangled Internet access years ago. Yeah, St. Vlad's operates on a closed network, but there is more to a person than status updates. There's photos, receipts, inter-academy e-mails. (GROANS) yöu're making my brain bleed. But yöu were sure right about cuckoo Christian. What a whack job. Are yöu seriously going to that study group with Camilla? yöu know, yöu don't have to use compulsion to be popular. yöu may not recall, but yöu can be quite charming on yöur own. Who has the time? Natalie, return that computer. Later, losers. (GROANS) Gosh. I wish Lissa could compulse Ray into being nicer. And taking my virginity. No one has ever really seen me naked. - Moroi, Dhampir, human, mineral. - Uh..huh. I once turned a plant around because I was too shy to change in front of it. yöu know I can't un-hear this, right? - Sorry. Yeah, I... - It's OK. Though I'm not much better. I'm crushing on my mentor, Dimitri, who's, like, old enough to be my... Not my father... like an uncle. Like a disturbingly sexy uncle. Andre? What the hell is this? NATALIE: Goodness gracious. Andre, Andre? That's Lissa's brother, isn't it? ROSE: Andre could have, like, any girl he wanted, and he usually did. Most of the girls knew the drill. It was down low, no commitments and... This is the face of a girl who did not know the drill. NATALIE: Holy moly. Mia's not just angry at Lissa. She despises the whole Dragomir line. Right, which makes her someone willing to take things to a whole other level. OK, all right. Take this back to Mia's room. - Yeah? - OK. See ya. - (SIGHS) - (OSCAR MEOWS) Hey. To what do I owe this honor? Can we talk, Oscar? ROSE: I'm worried about Lissa. I love that our princess is learning that the best defense is a good offense, and believe me, I am all for putting mad munchkin Mia in her place, but this Operation Brainwash is turning Lissa into something she's not. She can't see that. I can. It's like I feel Lissa's feelings more than she does. I need to put on my game face. Can't wait around for my next psychedelic flashback. The stakes are too high. - (GRUNTING) - Get it? Dhampir? Fight with stakes? Best defense, good offense. (GRUNTING CONTINUES) I knew yöu'd improve. No fair learning from a god. I heard yöu were good at taking on two guys at once. (GROANS, COUGHS) (CHUCKLES) Rose, uh, about Jesse and Ray... - Mason... - No, not that. In the locker room, it was weird. They had these bandages on their wrists. I don't know if it means anything. ROSE: Covered wrists? - Is that some new Moroi thing? - Check out Mia. (CHUCKLES) - She's getting away. - Let her. Kirova's the one I should be tracking. I need to break into Kirova's office today when the fang gang is asleep, OK? There's a file in there that could be the key to my past, my present and my future. That's it? Sounds cool. (GRUNTING) Forty-five minutes of silence. It has to be a Rose Hathaway record. OK. What do yöu know about Ms. Karp? Karp? She retired before I even arrived. Kirova, Victor, yöu. I ask about Karp, and it's no eye contact and a subject change. Enough. yöur training of late has been quite... - ...fine. - Fine? That's it? What do yöu want me to say? That yöu are a remarkable quick study? That yöu bring originality to classic moves? Yeah, I want yöu to say all those things. Good night, Rose. (ROSE SHOUTING) What did I do wrong? I had yöu. (LAUGHS) The battle cry was yöur first mistake. I like yöur laugh. Singular, not plural. It's the first time I've heard it. So even if I wouldn't have screamed, yöu still would have stopped me, right? Probably, but nice initiative. Keep trying those surprise attacks. It's good training for both of us. So, uh... yöu have any other moves yöu want to show me? (DOOR CLOSES) (CLATTERING) (SIGHS) I give it and they take it, but when it comes back, it's not the same, is it? I give it and they take it, but when it comes back, it's not the same, is it? They're coming to get me. But they want something that I can't give them. Those of us who never declared, those of us who have powers that have no name, there's only so much we can do, only so much we can handle. I should have gone with Vasilisa. I should have. I'm so alone. The clarity of the darkness beckons. I just want it to go away, the shaking, the scratching, nightmares, all go away. Lissa. The king and queen of the school together again, - the way it should be. - CHRISTIAN: Lissa! It's yöu and I who are destined to be together. Let me handle this. Look at what yöu made me do to myself, just like my damn parents. (SNARLS) (GASPS) Lissa! - (STUDENTS SCREAMING) - (GLASS BREAKING) I have a new family now. Strigoi brothers and sisters, attack! - (SNARLING) - (STUDENTS SCREAMING) (GRUNTING) (YELLING) - Rose, what's happening? - Stay close, right behind me, just like we practiced. (GRUNTING) OK. It's not looking great, but we will get through this, Lissa, we always do. Dimitri? Oh, Rose, yöu worry too much. Lissa, no. What are friends for? (WHIMPERING) No. No! Rose, are yöu there? Did yöu feel that one? What a weird dream. Yeah. Yeah, Liss, weird dream. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) Don't yöu dare feel sorry for me. Feel sorry for her, for the princess. (ROSE WHISPERING) I lied. Lissa doesn't think that yöu're a creepy stalker. She actually likes yöu. Then why did yöu...? Because I think that yöu're a creepy stalker, and I actually don't like yöu, but... I like the way that Lissa feels when she's around yöu. So what? Look at her. She's back on top. She's not happy. She's not herself, not as she wants to be. Trust me, I know, Christian. - I can f... - (ORGAN PLAYING) Shadow-kissed Anna did all she could, but on some days, Satan's darkness seeped into St. Vladimir, weakening his health and mind. See, Christian, I don't want that to be Lissa. yöu are the phantom here. yöu must know where they keep the books and scrolls and whatnot, and I need to figure out what her abilities... yöu sabotaged the first good thing to happen to me in a long time, and now yöu want me to help yöu? Ugh. God. Princess party in the royal rec room. - (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) - (CHEERING) There's my blood bitch. What took yöu so long? - (MOCK GROWLING) - (LAUGHING) It's great that yöu can joke about it. Lissa, listen. A lot has happened. We have to sit down and have a real conversation. Stop being so serious, Rose. It's a party. - Hey, Natalie. - Hi. (SIGHING) Awesome party, huh? Check this. (ALL GASPING) Can yöu say "keg magic"? Wow, Lissa, yöu can really do it all. Well, of course I can. I'm the princess. But doing it all is wrong, right? Fire, air, fire, air, fire, air, fire, air, - fire... - AARON: Hey. Aaron. (CHUCKLES) Rose! Where are yöu going? yöu weren't just going to bail without saying goodbye. I need to go home and sleep yöu off. Oh, is the bond making yöu as buzzed as I am? God, yöu are burning us both out on magic. Stop worrying. It's working. Weeks have gone by, and Mia is toast. No threats, no notes, no foxes. yöu're just bummed that I, not yöu, have neutralized the threat. yöu neutralized a threat, not "the" threat. And Aaron, seriously, yöu really want to show up to the Equinox Dance with that? He's... cute. And incredibly boring. yöu think everyone's boring. Christian's not. No, yöu were right about him. (STAMMERS) I knew "little flirtation with the dark side" sounded like one of yöur lines. - Sorry. - yöu know what? yöu can have Christian. yöu're both savages. Lissa, what I've been trying to tell yöu is that yöu're making this about high school, and it's about something more. (CLATTERING) - (GRUNTS) - (GASPS) Natalie... Are yöu nuts? What are yöu thinking? Trust me, yöu do not want to have to get a nose job in Montana! Sorry. I'm sorry. It's... When yöu both left the party, I had no one to... Everyone kept staring at me, so I left, and on my way back to the dorms, I swear, someone... more like something, started to follow me. I just... I don't know. I'm probably just being paranoid. - (DISTANT HOWLING) - (GASPS) That's not paranoia. - That's a psi-hound. - Rose thinks everything is a psi-hound. What's a psi-hound? - (GROWLING) - (NATALIE YELPS) (GROWLING CONTINUES) (DISTANT HOWLING) - What's my backpack doing over there? - Lissa, no. Lissa! (LISSA GASPS) Oscar! Oh, my God. (GASPS) Oscar. - Lissa, just... - No, Rose! (SIGHS) (THUD) Shadow-kissed Rose, yöu're bound to Lissa, and it's up to yöu to help her. Don't yöu understand? The more that Lissa uses her powers, the worse it'll get. The more dangerous it will be. They came for me. They'll come for her. What are yöu talking about? Is it the Strigoi? (LAUGHS) This isn't about Strigoi. Not everything to be feared roams outside the gates of St. Vladimir's. - I don't understand. - Oh, yöu couldn't understand it. yöu don't have to understand. Look at me. No, please, Ms. Karp, not compulsion, please. - I beg of yöu, please! - I'm not taking yöur memories away. Just hiding them for a bit. (ECHOING) Lissa's life is in peril. yöu only need to know yöu have to get her away from the academy. Forget everything I've said until it's time not to forget. (AIR BRAKES HISSING) ROSE: I guess yöu could say that it was half-repression and half-compulsion, and when yöu asked me why we left the academy in the first place, a part of me couldn't remember. I just knew that we had to get out. Outrageous. What Headmistress Kirova means to say is that it was brave of yöu to come forward, Rose. Well, I'm doing it for Lissa. She needs help. But is it really true she can bring the dead to life? Dead's dead... but from the brink of death. Not since St. Vladimir, and he never declared a magic, either. But there is no actual proof to anything yöu're saying. We found no cameras, and the compulsion alone can only be done in specific environments by trained professionals. Well, Lissa had no problem doing it to yöu, right in yöur own office. Surely, yöu had to wonder why yöu didn't just throw me out of school. It's outrageous. Enough, please. Ms. Sonya Karp. I want to see the Day Six footage. I've had a rough night. Don't make me crawl through a ventilator shaft and lower myself down into the security center on a wire. Headmistress, we have no right to keep Rose in the dark for as long as we have. All right. All right. Take her downstairs. Show her everything. Show us Karp Day Six, please. Thank yöu. (COMPUTER KEYS TAPPING) (COMPUTER CHIMES) I knew this is what yöu were looking for. Couple months after yöu left, Ms. Karp had a complete breakdown. And did the doctors find a way to help her? She found a way to help herself. Karp was not like the others. She didn't become Strigoi for the power or the immortality. She just... wanted the pain to go away. Nobody likes to talk about it, but the most effective way for the undeclared to take away their special anxiety is for them to take a life and become Strigoi. Strigoi have an inner clarity. No feelings. No worries. - No weakness. - (GASPS) DIMITRI: She got away. We don't know where she is now. (GASPS) Roza? Roza, calm down. - I'll protect yöu. - (LAUGHS) Roza? It's not Karp. It's Lissa. She's upstairs, and she's... she's pissed. LISSA: Cuts on my arm? Is that what she said? And without the use of a blade, no less. I know I've been having trouble declaring a magic, but that seems a pretty pointless skill. Allow me to put yöur mind at ease. Rose is a dear friend, but she has a talent for tall tales. Kirova's letting herself be compulsed even after I gave the compulsion speech! It's classic! Ever since the accident, it's like my life has been on autopilot. I guess in Ms. Karp's own spooky way, she was trying to help me figure it all out, but who do I have now? There is another person who can help yöu. He is on our flags, posters, uniforms and the statue in the middle of the school. St. Vladimir? OK. I'm on it. So, is this where the outcast losers hang out? - How did yöu know...? - Books on St. Vladimir. Now. Before, I was asking. This is me telling. - God, yöu're annoying. - I'm right that this could help Lissa. Yeah. That's what's so annoying. Come on. God, what's a girl got to do to get a definition - of "shadow-kissed" up in this... - Check this out. "Vladimir had mastered a very rare magic, and this magic had a "Name" Spirit." All this time, Lissa's been beating herself up about not being able to declare a magic. Oh, my God, if she only knew. This makes Lissa more special and valuable than I ever even imagined. I guess I should be happy that the bad guys aren't trying to kill Lissa, but it kind of just makes things more sick and disgusting. What do they want from Lissa? What is the point of killing her cat and setting up cameras? - Who could be that cruel? - Headmistress Kirova could be. And Mia likes to film her pranks. - That... - I know. Both a little on the nose, but... No, maybe they're so obvious that they're not obvious. I did see Kirova with Mia the other night. OK, my conspiracy theory of choice is that someone might be trying to drive Lissa mad, to take her out of throne contention. I mean, we all know Queen Tatiana has her issues. All three witches could be working together. I like the way yöur mind works. Just hold that thought. "At times, after the expense of power and in times of trauma, Vladimir's agony would manifest directly onto his skin." So this proves that Lissa's not a freak. Sort of. I mean, it shows that she could be rehabilitated. Wait. Lissa does something like that to herself? - Cuts and scars and... - Yes. Christian, she really could have used yöur support these past few weeks. yöu agreed Lissa hasn't been herself. It's her fault we're not together. God, the female, especially one who lives off of blood and magic, is going to have her mood swings. It is never the girl's fault, even when it is the girl's fault. No one ever explained that to yöu? yöu know, if yöu weren't so psychotic, yöu'd be fun to hang outwith. Same to yöu, creep. Thank yöu. - OK, bye. - (CHRISTIAN LAUGHS) - OK. - See ya. What were yöu doing with Rose? yöu were fornicating, weren't yöu? Fornicat... We were reading. We discovered a magic called Spirit. yöu have it. Ms. Karp had it, and so did St. Vladimir. - He used to cut himself, too. - Rose told yöu that? - I'm gonna kill her. - Look, stop it, Lissa. We're trying to help yöu. I know now if yöu don't have any family, yöu need as many friends as yöu possibly... I don't need friends or family or pets or... (SCREAMS) I hate yöu! (LISSA CRYING) yöu liar. - Lissa, listen... - Don't "Lissa, listen" me. - yöu've ruined my life. - Oh, bite me. - yöu wish, blood whore. - Wow. OK, Lissa, I need yöu to understand. We can learn how St. Vladimir used Spirit... - Did yöu kill my cat? - Hey, Oscar and I's relationship was on the mend. Lissa, this is important. Ms. Karp turned herself Strigoi. She didn't do it to become evil. She did it to take away from the scratching and the shaking. I mean... which future do yöu want, a sick and soulless one like Karp's or an epic one like Vladimir's? Stop talking to me about the past and the future, because I only care about the present. yöu know, if yöu have to choose one, pick the one that's happening right now. I am Princess Vasilisa Dragomir. I'm the last of the Dragomir line. If they see I'm weak, they'll attack. This isn't about a "they" anymore. This is about yöu! This is... - (SCREAMS) - (GASPS) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) yöu're awake, finally. The princess has been going through feeders all morning. How are yöu? I don't know. yöu tell me. I'm afraid to even look. I can move it, that's a good sign, right? Rose, I don't know how to say this, but... yöu are not injured. That's easy for yöu to say, comrade. I heard the crack. I saw the bone... Sorry to interrupt. - Hey. - Hi. - Here. - Thanks. So, I saw Aaron go by. - I kicked him to the curb. - Mmm. When I saw yöur leg, I got everything out of my system. - Everything. - Thanks for that, by the way. - (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) - Ugh. I'm so glad yöu're both alive and not at each other's throats. This whole matter of Spirit has taken us by surprise. Until the advisers arrive from Romania, we'll be sequestering yöu both into a bunker, away from any excitement. No classes, and obviously yöu will not be attending - the Equinox Dance tonight. - Oh, nonsense. Please, yöu have to come. I'm gonna go with the headmistress on this one, Prince Dashkov. Besides, we're all forgetting the most important thing. - We have nothing to wear. - There the gods have smiled upon us. Today is an overcast day, and I have engineered a little shopping expedition. Please? yöu know how much I need yöur help. And plus, when has shopping ever not cheered yöu up, Lissa? Where is Rose? (ROSE SHOUTS, GRUNTS) (DIMITRI AND ROSE CHUCKLE) (GROANS) OK. What was that about? It's just a little something Dimitri and I do to keep each other on our toes. Wow, that was weak. How long have yöu been in crush with him? I am... very sure that I don't know what yöu're talking about. - (ENGINE STARTS) - (POP MUSIC PLAYING) - So, do I get a silver stake? - That would be a... no. But remember, today yöu are not just Lissa's friend. Spiridon. Ain't likely any Strigoi is gonna make a play in a public place in broad daylight, but if Dimitri ain't giving yöu a stake, missy, yöu should have one of these bad boys. 'Causes a blinding flash of UV light. Buy yöu some time. Well, at least someone thinks I'm worth a weapon. So, my superpower turned out to also be my Kryptonite. Wow, yöur Highness with the pop culture reference. yöu know, I... I confused power with popularity. (LOUD SHRIEKING) (EXCITED CHATTER) Ever wonder what it'd be like to be like that? It's not our destiny. Destiny? I hate that word. yöu know, "royal responsibility," "the Moroi come first," it's all so twisted. It's not twisted. I'm yöur Dhampir and yöu're my Moroi. Done. Some days we're kooky teenagers, and other days I'm risking my neck to protect yöu from an ancient race of predatory vampires... or whoever else, and that's life. At least until they come up with a better word for it. Somebody looks tense. Free massage? (GROANING) I'm really sorry. I'm so sorry, OK? Run. Ms. Karp, I understand all that, but Mia and my brother... don't think so. Andre was generous and funny and amazing, but... he could kind of be a player. Lissa, don't look like yöu don't know what I'm talking about, 'cause I can feel yöu, OK? yöu know, I hate having a best friend I can't lie to. Do yöu really think Mini-Mia's behind everything? No, not exactly. But I think we'll find out tonight. Tomorrow yöu're getting sequestered away by Spirit advisers, so the dance is the last chance for anybody to try to get to yöu. Look, if yöu could put a pin in all that, we have more vital matters. Finding yöu a dress. (SINGSONGY) I can go into my trust fund. I could not possibly accept that. That's yöur dress. That's the dress yöu were born to wear. Lissa, we have more important things to do than sh... That is my dress. Thank yöu, sir, and if yöu could just sign here? And that is yöur necklace. ROSE: That is my necklace. That's not yöur necklace. So not my necklace. Did yöu take my lip gloss? Corpse Number Five? Like I'd wear yöur pale-ass lip gloss. No way. Natalie, yöu look gorgeous. Rose... this is for yöu, from my father. That's my necklace. Daddy saw yöu looking at it. Here. - How does it look? - Beautiful. (METAL MUSIC PLAYS ON COMPUTER) All right, ladies. I don't know what's gonna happen tonight. At this point, I can't remember who loves us and who hates us... but I do know that we are going to own this dance. Let's make tonight our bitch. (BEAR IN HEAVEN "SINFUL NATURE") (HISSING) Not much of a reaction from yöur boyfriend. He's not my boyfriend, but... grading on the Dimitri curve, a huge reaction... mammoth, gargantuan. Come here. Genuinely un-small. Christian Ozera. At a school dance. After this week, I thought I'd lost the ability to be surprised. I'm sorry about that kiss the other day. What about the one right now? (KATY PERRY "SPIRITUAL") - Rose. - Hey, what's up? - (SIGHING) OK. - Rose, yöu look... No, yöu don't get to stare at her. I took it upon myself to talk to these royal pains in the butt. ROSE: Hmm. Don't yöu have something to say? - We're sorry. - Hmm. We didn't do anything to yöu that we said we did. yöu're telling something that never happened actually never happened? Thanks. Mia let us have sex with her if we obeyed her. I tagged the note at the church and air-blasted the memorial. What did yöu think of the scary screen saver? We actually put a lot of work into that. And the bloody one just happened. We thought it'd be fun to all hook up in the princess's room, and things got out of hand, literally. It's called blood splash. It's a new Moroi fad, where when things get hot and sticky, yöu fang open yöur wrist and spray. Ew! Stop. I nap on that couch. OK, what about the cat? We thought it was a fox. Hurting animals... that's disgusting. Said the creepy blood splasher. Please, Rose, don't kick my ass. ROSE: Go dance with Natalie. Go, now. (SIGHS) Oh, Jesse. - Who's the man? - yöu are so the man. Break the case wide open and I still only get the cheek. Ouch. Ever feel like yöu're being watched? Can we pretend the past month never happened? Why were yöu in the hospital? Pregnant? - I guess not. - Herpes? Maybe yöur baby has herpes. I don't care if it's true. I'll tell... - Go away, Mia. - Why are yöu Dragomirs such drags? First Andre, then yöu steal Aaron from me and don't even keep him. - I don't need this. - I vow to take down the entire... I'll fire-magic yöu into ash. I'll just water-magic myself before yöu can... Gosh, yöu two are a riot. Allow me, Mr. Ozera. Rose, I hear yöu and the princess are friends again. Too bad... could have made a great team. Oh, nice wrist corsage, Splashy. yöur sex slaves told me everything, and poor Aaron had no idea what a sociopath yöu really are. - I'll bet yöu did off Lissa's cat. - Oscar? I gave him treats. I would never hurt a kitty. Oh, my God, yöu poor little... All this time, me thinking that yöu're a villain when yöu're really just... yöu're just an insecure little girl in desperate need of attention. - (SHRIEKS) - (CROWD GASPS) Everyone saw that I tried to take the high road there. - CHRISTIAN: Rose. - Sort of. If Mia didn't do it, that means there's a bigger threat still out there. - Hathaway, yöu're out of here. - Lissa's run off. I didn't see where. Oh, God, if only there was a secret place that she went to when she was sad. - Right. - Genius. (GROANS) OK, OK. OK. (SIGHS, WHISPERS) Please, please, please, please. - LISSA: Christian. - We need to get yöu somewhere safe. - Just a little longer in the moonlight. - No, no. Our moonlight. OK, now we need to go. - (CHRISTIAN GRUNTS) - (LISSA SCREAMS) Lissa. Headmistress Kirova, we need to get Dimitri. - The princess is in trouble. - She's not the only one. - yöu don't understand. - I do understand, Rose. I understand more than yöu'll ever... (GASPS) I could have been a model. A man in Milan gave me his card when I was 16. (KNOCKING) Dimitri? Dimitri, open up. Dimitri, something has happened. Rose, what's wrong? What's right? Sweet sassy molassey. What do yöu want, Rose? Some of that. This is insane. What are we doing? Everything. I love yöur dress. Let's burn it. (ROSE GASPS) Love charms... hypnotic, dangerous, put over jewelry... Forget about it. Lissa's been kidnapped. We have to hurry. Report from the gate. Nothing's come in or out. They're still on academy ground... Have yöu cleared this with Kirova? Better to beg forgiveness than ask permission. Yeah, and I put a sedative in her ass. Let me concentrate. yöu've got to be kidding me. - DIMITRI: What is it? - Nothing. Hold on. OK. SPIRIDON: He's coming in. Check the blindfold. No compulsion tonight. I can't make out anything through the blindfold, but I know that voice. It's... that guardian. - Oh, no. - DIMITRI: "Oh, no," what? "Oh, no," who. The bad guy's Victor Dashkov. Welcome, Vasilisa. How was the dance? It's officially tomorrow, and, as promised, we have much to talk about. Forgive me if I don't make eye contact. - I've seen yöu in action. - Why are yöu doing this? My dear, the simple truth is, I need yöu to heal me. Testing yöu with the animals was misguided, but earth-magicking the cement and shattering Rose's ankle was supremely clarifying. yöu're forgetting something. My bond with Rose is practically a psychic GPS. Ah, yes, but the necklace gift that I gave to Rose is bathed in a very expensive love charm, and she is a little too preoccupied to be of much use to yöu. That's what yöu think, mother... Victor wants her to heal him. yöu were my family's most cherished friend. Why didn't yöu just ask me? How touching... genuinely, my darling, but a chronic disease like my Sandovsky's needs continual healings, and then there is the other matter. The physical toll on me. Yes, Spirit users take their power from their own essence. To heal another requires giving part of oneself, and it can destroy one over time. yöu want me to give up my life for yöurs. Basically. But, yöu see, my dear, I am much more important than yöu, and the Moroi need a strong leader, but my disease means that I cannot occupy my rightful place upon the throne. But yöu shouldn't bother yöur pretty little head about all this royal intrigue. Guess what, Victor. The spirit in this pretty little head isn't going to heal yöu. - yöu can't make me. - (GROANS) Bring in Kenneth. Do yöu know somebody named Kenneth? yöur compulsion won't work on Kenneth. He's blind, but he's one of the Moroi's most ingenious air users. - Shall we begin? Heal me. - Go to hell. yöu're up, Kenneth. (GASPS) - (BLOWING) - (GASPS, SCREAMS) - (GASPS, SCREAMS) - Rose? ROSE: Don't stop. They're torturing her. Heal me. - (INHALING) - (LISSA GASPS) (GASPS) Now he's... (CHOKING) (GASPS) (GASPS) Ah, Lissa. Heal me. (CANE CLATTERS) My... this really worked out. Take the girl upstairs till departure. Rose, stay here. It's too dangerous, yöu'll just get in the way. - But... - Do I really need to remind yöu the last time I said "stay in the car" and was disobeyed? No, I totally understand. Good luck. - yöu're not really staying, are yöu? - What do yöu think? But what did Dimitri mean by "last time I said 'stay in the car" '? He was talking about another girl from another time. She was a novice. I'm a guardian. Let's roll, fire magic. I need a seeing-eye dog. (GRUNTING) Take my arm. The princess is upstairs. (GRUNTING) No, no, not this way. - Rose. - Keep going. - It's right up there. - Rose! What?! - (YELLS) (SCREAMS) (THUD) (BUZZING) (GRUNTING) Spiridon, send for the girl. We're ready now. I believe yöu can fly. (GRUNTING) Feel free to chime in at any time with some fire magic. Maybe a ring of flame around the knob? I've never really worked outside a classroom setting before. Forget it, she's gone. Stop trying to save yöurself, Liss. Stupid one-way bond. (GASPS) (SNARLING) - (LOUD GROWL) - (GASPS) (HOWLS) Psi-bounds. (BOTH GROWLING) Expensive to breed, difficult to train, but there is no denying the brilliance of the psi-hounds. They will stalk the princess, maneuver her, but they won't attack unless I say the word. (SNARLING) (HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING) (GRUNTS) (BANGING AND GRUNTING) I presume yöu can deal with that? They say Dimitri is a god. Well, I'm an atheist... an atheist with a big gun. (SCREAMS) (GRUNTING) (GRUNTING CONTINUES) (SNARLS) (GRUNTING) That's it? Seriously? (GRUNTS) I've waited for this moment. Do yöu know what it's like to always be referred to as the second best guardian? No. (SPIRIDON SCREAMS) Are yöu OK? - Did yöu see what Victor did? - I know. What an asshole. I hate to interrupt, but unless either of yöu can fly a chopper, - maybe we should get going. - (GUNSHOT) - (LISSA SCREAMS) - Lissa, get back. Rose, be a dear and step away from the princess. I don't want to accidentally shoot her when I'm shooting yöu. yöu heard him, he won't shoot me. - I am yöur guardian. - No, Rose, yöu can't do this. ROSE: Lissa, don't yöu dare fight. Lissa. - yöu're worse than a Strigoi. - Christian! Do yöu know what I like most about the psi-hounds? They're wonderful at tracking. They're even better at killing. - Attack! - (SNARLS) (BARKS) No. (GASPS) (SCREAMS) (PSI-HOUNDS YELPING) Now, that's some freaking fire magic. Rose, I need to save him, but I can't. Victor took everything, all my energy. Power up, Princess. (SIGHING) - (THUD) - (SIGHS) (GASPS) KIROVA: This has been a night that St. Vladimir's will never forget. We have extra guardians manning the academy perimeter. Nothing can get in. Victor Dashkov will be confined to a holding cell downstairs until he can be transferred to the Royal Court Prison to await trial. How's Natalie? She worshipped her father. She must be devastated. The other members of the Dashkov family are removing her from school. For the best. Uh..oh, Rose. This came for yöu. Oh, great. KIROVA: Uh, Dimitri, one last thing... The time gap after Rose so dramatically burst out of my office... DIMITRI: It should all be explained in the other file. A Nobu charm was put on a necklace Rose had been wearing. The spell caused Rose to attack me and me to attack her. I disengaged the necklace before critical... violence could occur. Mmm. Hey, we should probably talk about what happened earlier. I just want yöu to know I would never use the words "sweet sassy molassey" unless under the influence. It is not a matter of amusement or discussion. - It was horrific. - Horrific... isn't really the first adjective that comes to mind. Don't make light of this. It's one thing if I were 36 and yöu were 28, or me 28 and yöu 20. That's a lot of math for someone who's not interested. yöur life is about homework, dances, parties. How can yöu say that after what happened? It's what it should be about. I'm not interested in yöu in that way. - OK. - It was... - ...just a spell. - (DOOR OPENS) - Let it go. - Got it. - Rose? - Yeah? yöu're still here? I'm not sure how I feel about this, but Victor has requested a moment of yöur time. Yeah, no, that's not gonna happen. He said something about yöu being "shadow-kissed"? She's not going. That's final. Don't tell me what to do. ROSE: yöu look good, Vic. Which is ironic, considering it means more time rotting in jail. Don't take this the wrong way, Rose, but... I probably should have killed yöu. There's a compliment in there somewhere. I spent a lot of money on that charm. It didn't quite work out the way I wanted. Mmm. It worked out well enough. Caused a man with no interest in me to burn off my dress, so... yöu're so tough, so one-of-a-kind. But yöu're still a girl. All this has happened, and what yöu want to know is, "Does Dimitri really like me?" It's a powerful charm, Rose, but it's not that powerful. There has to be a degree of affection and attraction already in place. Happy? - Shadow-kissed? - Ah, yes. I owe yöu that. yöu see, I didn't begin to track Vasilisa with some silly old raven. My eye was on her long before. I've seen the accident report. And there's absolutely no way that either of yöu should have survived. The accident was what woke her spirit in the first place. The fear of seeing yöu dead made it burst out, allowing her to heal, made yöu form yöur bond. Rose... yöu've been kissed by shadows. yöu've crossed over into death, into the other side, and returned. Don't yöu think that leaves a mark on the soul... somewhere? That's why yöu're not afraid to show yöur feelings, Rose, yöur passion, yöur anger. That's what makes yöu remarkable. Yes. But it's ironic... considering. Considering what? (CHOKES) (CHOKING) Considering I'll have to kill yöu. Natalie. yöu made yöur own daughter turn Strigoi? And how do yöu think I can circumvent the outside security? I'd do anything for my daddy. (ROSE GRUNTING) All that training, and yet, I'm going to obliterate yöu. VICTOR: yöu see, Natalie was not the innocent yöu thought she was. In fact, she was the one who provided me with the intel regarding yöu, Dimitri and Vasilisa. The cat was my idea. Daddy wanted to do another fox. (MOCK GASP) Father, look. Rose does choke before Strigoi. (GROANING) I don't understand. To become a Strigoi, don't yöu have to... Yes. I chose Ray to be my first. Killing him was a lot more fun than losing my virginity to him would've been. And with a lot more blood. - (HISSING) - Too soon? (GRUNTING) - (HISSES) - (GRUNTING) (SPITS) Hey, Victor? Aren't yöu afraid yöur new Strigoi daughter won't be able to resist yöur Moroi veins? Don't be ludicrous. I'm gonna wait outside, Natalie. Finish her off. yöu don't know what high school is like for a loser like me. I was so scared all the time... so weak, so sad, so lame. Now my eyesight is perfect, my skin is clear, and so is my mind. I may be dead, but I have never felt so alive. How awesome for yöu. Say cheese. - (SCREAMING) - (GRUNTS) (WEAKLY) Rose? Oh. (GRUNTS) (BEEPS) (DOOR HISSING) (CRUMBLING) Maybe I won't kill yöu. Maybe I'll make yöu just like me. That way, we can be friends forever and ever. BFF! (HISSES) (GRUNTING) (YELLS) (GROWLING) (CHOKING) Who's choking now? Roza, Roza. Oh, my Roza. Lissa, yöu're gonna want to see this. I don't believe my eyes. yöu got him wearing a color other than black. LISSA: Baby steps. Oh, Rose, wait. There's so much to read here. Apparently, Vladimir and Anna almost drowned in this flood, but he saved them from certain death, and listen to this. "It took many years for Vladimir to master the power of his Spirit." "Despite his sufferings and delusions," "he never contemplated the way of the Strigoi," "because he always had the strength" "of his shadow-kissed guardian, Anna, to see him through." Similarities. Weird. Well, Christian, for us, weird... Doesn't begin to cover it. (SIGHS) Do I have to? It's time. (LAUGHTER) - (FANFARE PLAYING) - God, not her. Not now. And once again, this grotesque maelstrom of indecency seems centered on one royal individual. - Where's Vasilisa Drag... - Thank yöu, yöur Majesty, for allowing me to clear the air. I finally declared a magic, and it's called Spirit. It may take years to get a handle on it, but I have a bunch of wise men in robes to help me out. And yes, that was not a mirage yöu saw on the dance floor. My boyfriend is Christian Ozera, and his parents were Strigoi. Get over it. He has. I'm not quite sure what yöu think... - Shh! Not now, dear. - (CROWD MURMURS) Blood. Blood is what connects us all. Blood is sustenance. Blood is family. Blood is pain, and blood is death, be it the fang of the Strigoi or a drunk driver on the wrong side of the road. (CRYING) Blood is many things, and sometimes it gets so crazy and confusing that yöu need a best friend to tell yöu, "it's OK." "It's all life, at least until they come up with a better word for it." Unfortunately, yöu can't all have a Rose Hathaway. (CHUCKLES) I'm very lucky that she's mine, but if yöu don't have a soul mate, by Vlad, the least yöu deserve is kindness and dignity and something more original than gossip, snobbiness, slut-shaming and bullying. Let's prove that Moroi blood is worth protecting. What do yöu say, everyone? No more bad blood. (APPLAUSE) (APPLAUSE CONTINUES) ROSE: So, that's Natalie, huh? Looks... fresh. I'm sorry. I had to. I'm sorry. - I hesitated. - Rose... yöu're so brave and strong and bold. Sadly, yöu'll have many other opportunities to kill Strigoi. yöu lied about yöur feelings for me. Yes. I did. Why would yöu do that? It's more than my age and my position at the academy. Our allegiance is to the Moroi. If I let myself love, I wouldn't throw myself in front of the princess. I would throw myself in front of yöu. It's funny. yöur reasons for not loving me just... make me love yöu more. I want yöu to kiss me without a magic charm forcing yöu to do it. That's not a great idea. Please. Everyone's at the banquet. Just... one last kiss. Yes! Yes, yes! Yes! Are yöu not entertained?! (ROSE GIGGLES) (ROSE GIGGLES) ROSE: My name is Rose Hathaway, and I'm not yöur normal teenage girl, but I guess, is there really such a thing? Every life has rules, traditions, friends and enemies, sheer terror and incredible joy, - but I've learned... - (CAWS) Whoa! Watch where yöu're going there, bird. Are yöu kidding me? - It's yöu, isn't it? - (CAWS) - Come... - (CAWS) my shadow-kissed soul mate. (CAWING) Well, same to yöu, buddy! (CAWING CONTINUES) Now! Soon.
