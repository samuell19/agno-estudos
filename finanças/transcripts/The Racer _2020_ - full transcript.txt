Please, Tartare, just a few questions? 5 minutes, Tartare. Any chance of an autograph? They say it is the most grueling sporting event in the world. Do you think you have a chance of winning? Should I put me money on ya? No, I'm a domestique. A what? I'm a domestique. I'm a support rider. I'm not supposed to win. See that guy over there? That's Tartare. That's our lead rider. He's gonna win. You're gonna wanna get his autograph. Okay? - Have you got another one? It doesn't work. - Don't worry about it. Two weeks ago I was nobody, right now I'm famous in Ireland. - Who wants a look? - I'll take a wee nosy, boss! Now gentlemen, five plates of plain pasta? - That's us, darlin'. - Yeah. A steak tartare with a raw egg? - And a double cheeseburger with extra chips. - The cheeseburger's mine. Hmm. Hmm. Mm. I go. I go. I cannot sit here with this, uh, fat burger face. I'm on a pasta-free diet. What's funny? No, what's funny? Why do you laughing? You remember when seeing your name in the paper was enough to power you through the whole tour. Look at you. Your first tour. 1979. I forgot you were a young bastard once. Dom! Dom! - He wants some water. - Just keep the pace, eh? Julio,? Okay. Kids are hungry. How are you doing, Sonny, are you good? See you're smoking all the time again, eh? Alright, Tone, you good? Oh, Jesus! Who knocked the froth off his cappuccino? I should not do, I know. Hey. It's important job, you know. Hey, look, I think my saddle is little high, huh. It's important. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I make a joke, so he was like serious, like, losing his mind, so I tried to go. You did a good job. When you're in finish line... - I go, I go. - Okay. I will wear the other shoes, okay? Yeah, take the other ones. They'll be better. Viking. Viking. - I need to know about next year. My contract. - Yeah. Let's just see how you get on this year. Fuck him. He's just playing hardball. You're part of the furniture for fucks sake! Ah, hello, hey, Brad, how's it going? Listen, I have a question for you about, um... about next year and... Hello? I'm, uh... I'm thinking about leaving Austrange. Yeah. No, I'm not gonna bother you too long. I just wanted to, uh... Yeah, no, Tartare... He's good. He's, uh... Yeah, he's in shape, he's in shape. Well, I don't know what he's gonna do next year, um... Alright, big man. - Hey, guys. - Hey mate. - What's your blood tag, Kiwi? - Um, Madame Foo-Foo. Madame Foo-Foo. Was your pet a fuckin' drag queen? Shut the fuck up, mate! Was my sister's Pekinese. Here you go, Madame Foo-Foo. - It's cold. - All the better for boosting your blood, son. - Enzo. - Milou. - Who's Milou when he's at home? - You know, it's the dog from Tintin. Excuse me. Tintin's dog was called Snowy. Well, in Portugal it was Milou. Hang on. I've got two bags tagged with Milou here. - No, my dog was Milou. - What? - It's my dog too. - Are you after my blood, Enzo? - My dog was Milou. - Oh, bloody hell. So, what do we do now? What's the worst that can happen if we take the wrong blood? Let me see. You're the same blood type, so small chance of complications. - Yeah, like what? - Well, there's always a possibility - of an allergic reaction. - And that's it? Like no other possible side effects? No, the other possible side effect is, if you don't take it, you won't win. Ah give me, give me, give me. So, oof... This is me. - This is me, this is me. - What if it's not you? This is me, Enzo. I can feel myself inside this bag. This is me. Think it's safer if I don't. Okay? Go sit down and you take the blood. What's the worst that can happen? Please! Well, I guess that's settled then. - Now, Dom. - Do you know, Sonny, that I'm Belgian. Tintin's dog's actually called Bobby. Fascinating. Absolutely, fucking fascinating. That should do ya. Thanks. How ya feeling? I need to see a doctor. Give Strocatti a call. He's probably in his room. Sonny, not the team doctor. Are you okay? Just wanna get it checked. I don't want the whole team to know about it. - Especially not Viking with the way he's been lately. - Sure. I just wanna be 100% fit, okay? Leave it with me. Thanks. One more time. Okay. Okay. Ah. Ah... Okay. You can relax. Well, your chest sounds clear. Your heartrate is pretty low but you are an athlete. How long have you had it? Um, for about a week. I wake up coughing and then feel like I'm choking. Any other symptoms? Uh, dizziness. Uh, shivering. Sweat when I wake up. That's strange 'cause they're all flu symptoms but I don't think it's the flu. Can I ask you about your diet? Um, it's limited. Protein and carbs on races. Well your immune system may be low. It's hard to fight infection with an imbalanced diet. You might have caught a little virus here in Ireland. With a virus you just have to ride it out, if you'll excuse the pun. Uh, the UCI gave me one of these while I'm working for them. So I'll give you my number. If things get bad, just, um... just give me a call. - Thanks. - And, uh, be no harm to see a nutritionist after the race. Just help build you up. Listen, um... Dr. Lynn Brennan, would you mind not telling anybody about this meeting please? I just don't want the team to know. Patient doctor confidentiality prevents that Mr... - Dom. - Mr. Dom. - Dominique Chabol. - Okay. Sonny. - Thanks for doing that, Lynn. - Sure, no problem. - See you around. - See ya. Thanks. All good? - Where'd you find her? - Nice, eh? Medical graduate. Placement with the UCI for the Irish leg of the tour. Message from Viking. Good news? It's from my sister. Your sister? Yeah, yeah. She wants me to call her. Don't talk to me about families. - Yeah? - Dom? - Yeah? - Please come to my room. I cannot breathe. No, just relax, relax. Okay. Yeah, keep breathing, Tar. Okay, see you in a bit. The pressure's too much. I could not sleep. I need to see the road, Dom. - Okay, I know but you gotta relax. Open up, open up. - No. I was laying in that bed for two hours and I couldn't sleep, Dom! I couldn't sleep. - You know as I said I need to see the finish line. - You get this every time. Okay? It's always before a stage you get this. No, Dom, I need... The finish line, I cannot do anything, okay? Okay, can you breathe? Can you breathe? Just breathe in. You know the routine. The routine. Put your hand on your nose. I was laying in my bed and I did not see, I could not see the road. You focus, okay? You listen to me. Close your eyes. Put your hand on your nose. You see the road. You see the road. You see the finish. Okay, calm down. Relax. Calm, calm down. Hand on your nose. Alright. Alright. Alright. And deep. Never stand up when you can sit down. Never sit down when you can lie down. I told you he has a big arm, didn't I? Good work, son. Very good. I need this power for the mountain. Have you tried sit up explodes? - What? - They're the best exercise that maximize power. Lie back, stretch your arms out like you're Christ on the cross. Dom, you grab hold of his ankles. I'm gonna lay this towel across your head and shoulders. When I pull it away you sit up as fast as you can. - Okay. - Ready? Here we go. And up. Can you feel the power it gives ya? Come on, one more time. And up. One last time. Really fast now and up. Team meeting. Let's go. I don't know. He has no idea. Okay, ladies. I want to give you your race numbers for tomorrow, but first some news. Last night I heard Team Settosa selected a new young domestique, Jan Mertens. He's very fast and very strong. This has forced me to rethink strategy. - Erik Schultz. - Yeah? You will replace Dom Chabol for the tour. Quiet! Quiet please. I want to take this opportunity to say, thank you Dom for being there when we needed you. We couldn't have done it without you. To Dom... For the rest of you... Dom, Dom, Dom. My friend. If this was my decision, you're riding tomorrow. Believe me. Dom. Erik fucking Schultz! Erik is younger, lighter, faster and stronger. He's not a lead out man! Does he know I have to put Tartare to sleep like a little baby every night? Look at yourself, Dom. You're nearly 39 years old. - What do you want me to say? - The team needs experience. - My experience! - The wheels spin, spins again, then spins again. That's all the fucking experience you need. The tour starts tomorrow, 10am. After the Grand Départ, you're out of contract. Free to go. - That's it? - That's it. Fuck! You alright, big man? I just heard the news. What a cunt! Dom, open up. We can get a bevy. Open up! I'll see ya later, okay? - What can I get ya? - You have a wine list? Wine list? There you go, sir. That's it? That's it.

I'm a support rider. I'm not supposed to win. - You're not supposed to win? - No. It's not my job. The lead rider wins. So I set the pace. He's close behind me in the wheel and I push the air. Push the air? What, like a slipstream? Yeah, I block the wind. When the sprint comes, I move over so he flies out of my wheel towards the finish line. So I use my energy for him to use it at that moment. You're not supposed to win? No. But don't you ever wanna win yourself? Yeah, of course every rider wants to win a stage but... it's a dream. ♪ I feel the night ♪ ♪ I feel the night Is creepin' in ♪ ♪ I feel the night ♪ ♪ I feel the night Is movin' in ♪ ♪ And there's a time ♪ ♪ There's a time I need to face you ♪ - Dom.

He's in hospital. We registered you. Look, Dom... I know I said a lot of shit in the gym. But now I need you. The team needs you. And what about next year? I haven't got time for this, Dom. The fact is, you're still under contract. So get your shit together. Yes! Lazarus is raised. Yes, and here we are on an unusually sunny day in Dublin, the capital city of the Emerald Isle where the Grand Départ is not far off. Today there's a carnival atmosphere. And Irish eyes are smiling. Welcome to the official start of the Tour de France 1998. Please join me for the countdown. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. There they go, all 164 riders roll through the ceremonial zone neutral. A parade for the fans before the actual race starts on the outskirts of the city. At the head of the peloton are tour favorites Team Settosa and Team Austrange. On the left is Luxembourg rider Stefano Drago, who was disqualified last year for throwing his water bottle at Flemish domestique Dom Chabol. Interesting to see how they'll get along this year. Commencing in the center of Dublin city, the route takes the riders out to Bray, County Wicklow and concludes back in Dublin, for the sprint finish in the Phoenix Park. Come on! Come on! Watch out for the turn, guys. Watch out the turn! - Go! - Go! Go! Watch the turn, watch the turn. This is classic Dom Chabol. Forging ahead. Setting the pace at the head of the peloton. Being jostled for prime position by fellow Flemish rider Jan Mertens. Both domestiques trying to clear the way for their lead riders Drago and Tartare as they enter the final 5K of the stage. Ladies and gentlemen, here we go Tartare and Chabol. Tartare fights it out with Drago in the final 100 meters of the stage. Sprinting for the finish line. He's passing, he's passing. Surely. Yes, he has it! The Italian takes the yellow jersey. Narrow... And Tartare wins! Tartare! The winner of the yellow jersey. Team Austrange does it again! Winners of the first stage of the 1998 Tour de France. That was pure fucking poetry! Hey, Dardonne, you won the Maillot Blanc. The white jersey. You won it! Belgian rider Lionel Dardonne. Winner of the white jersey. The young rider classification for the first stage of this year's tour. Hey, where's Settosa? Where's Settosa? Big congratulations to Tartare! Bravo! Bravo, Dardonne for the white jersey. Good on ya, mate! I want to say something straight from my heart. Great teams work like... like machines. You know, you've got all different parts and they work alone. But it's better all together as one. And today we showed that we're a great team! And you are my family. And to win, I need you. But, Dom... You're the great domestique, the best lead out man on the road. So to Dom. Back where he belongs! - Good on you, mate! - To Dom, yeah. Dom, cheers. Sonny, the guys you rode with back in the '70s. What do they do now? Well, lemme see. You know what happened to Jacamo? He landed on his feet, the jammy bastard. Marco B, he became a sports coach in his hometown. Who else was there? Jannis. - Ah, no, Eddie, What's his name? No, no, Jeff or some... - Eddie de Cavort. Aye. De Cavort. He became a taxi driver man. Owns his own business now by the way. Yeah, some didn't make it. Johannes, Drier, Bert, Uster, Bosh. Went to bed and never woke up. Right. Over you go. I'll finish you off so to speak. What about you, Sonny? You still happy here at Austrange? Well, I don't know about Austrange, but I love this circus. I fucking love it. I couldn't do anything else anyway. My heart was fucked. Doctors advised me to pack it in. I didn't mind. I'd had enough. Enough of the bike that is. - And then? - Well, you know Bonheur? - The Director of Sportif of Settosa? - Aye. One day he gave me a box of oil and tells me to rub down one of the guys. And I've been doing that ever since. Happy as a pig in shite. Dom? Two minutes in, two minutes out. - Do you want me to get that? - No, it's probably Tar or my sister. Leave it. What is this, Glasgow Central? - Oh, hello. - Is Dom there? We had an arrangement to meet in the bar at 8. Just gimme a wee second there. That young doctor. Did you arrange to meet her? Yeah, I forgot. No bother. Aye, he's, uh... he's coming now. Sorry. I told Sonny to come down and tell you that I was gonna be late. - 'Cause of the race and... - Slipped my mind. The madness of the first day and everything. I'm sorry. You wanna come in? Isn't this lovely? I'll see you later, okay? - Yeah, I'm really sorry. Um... - Okay. How was your first day on the Tour? Well, my medical training wasn't exactly put to the test. Zero action. Praying for a big pile up tomorrow. Lots of nasty gashes and concussions so I can get my hands dirty. I'll see what I can do to help. What's with all the ice? I mean, I can't believe it. Here I am on work placement with the Tour de France and I get to stay in a hotel. What a buzz. And I tell you what. I am fucking lucky to be doing that rather than interning at some shitty hospital. I mean, to my mind, to do anything well, I mean, to be really fucking good at it you've got to feel it. Especially, when you're dealing with people's lives. Yeah. I mean, it must be the same with you guys, all or nothing. - How long have you been cycling? - Since I could walk. Been competing for, um... for 25 years. Yeah. That's probably longer than you've been alive. Well, I wasn't gonna say that but, um, but yeah. Well, I mean, you must have been to some amazing places. Seen some incredible sights. Seen a lot of bad hotels and a lot of macadam. Do you mean tarmacadam? Yeah, macadam.. . Uh, you know, I've probably raced on every continent in the world. Like, I go to Rome for a race and then, you know, we're in the city and I'm there with 150 other guys on a bike. And all I see is men's asses. Well, I can think of worse things to be looking at. - Hello? - Dom. Tartare. Yeah, no, no, relax. Relax. - Yeah. Breathe. - No, man. I cannot breathe. Breathe, Tar. I'll be there in five minutes. Okay, yeah, bye.. He does not sound very happy. No, he's, um... That's my lead rider and he's a bit, um... Look, do you wanna stay here? - I'll be back in five minutes. - Mm-hmm. Okay, so... Not the second time. No, I promise you, I cannot. I stop. I fucking stop. - Tar. - I fucking stop riding the bike. Every single night you get this. You know the routine, can you just please think about it. - Just put your... - Yeah, but why? Why? Why am I doing this? Why? He asked me? Jesus Christ. Okay. It's good, that's good, that's good. Dom? Dom! Dom. Dom! Wake up. I don't know. He can't catch his breath. Jesus! We need to get him moving. - I'll call an ambulance. - Come on, up you come. - Okay. - Come here! Come here! Keep walking him up and down. I'll be back in a sec. Keep walking him! Hey, hey. Dom, Dom. It's okay. It's okay, just walk. Walk. Just keep walking. Here we go.. Just keep walking. Just keep walking. - Dom! Dom! Come on. Come on. - Right, here we go. What are you doing? Fuck. Dom, Dom. What are you doing with that, Sonny? What's going on? Okay. Dom? - Dom? Hey, Dom? - Alright, big man. You know the drill. Come on, up ya come. Unless you wanna die in some grubby hotel on the arse end of... What are you trying to do with him? - Just get him on the bike. - No, no. - He's got to go to the fucking hospital! - Do as I ask! - God! - After three. - What? - Help me with his leg. - No, no, no. He needs to go to fucking hospital. - One, two, three. - Okay. - That's it. Come on, Dom. Now push down. That's it. Push down. - Come on now. - Are you okay, Dom? Push down, that's it, son. - Where's his monitor? - Huh? His heart monitor! Where is it? - It's in the bathroom. - Get it! Okay. That's it, Dom. That's it. You're doing good. You're doing great. Come on, son. Help me put it on him, eh? Give it to me. Come on, Dom. Keep going. Keep going. - This is insane. - That's it, keep going. - He's on something, isn't he? - You're coming up, Dom! You're coming up. I can't watch this. I'm calling an ambulance. I've got this from here, darling. That's it Dom. Come on now. You keep going. 37.. 38. 39. Come on now, you push down. That's it, Dom, you're, you're doing great. Come on, son. Come on. Alright, big man? Lynn. Listen, about last night, I'm just, please, I'll try and explain. You don't need to explain anything to me. I've actually learned quite a lot in the last few hours and realized you guys are all off your heads on EPO. EPO. You... you might as well be putting fucking glue in your veins. It's amazing you ever wake up. How do you think that made me feel? As a doctor? Do you know what I cannot wrap my head around is why risk your life like that? Everybody does it. You're not even allowed to win, Dom. You're a professional loser. Professional fucking loser. I didn't shit myself, did I? No. No, you didn't shit yourself. Dom, that was a close fucking call. If it wasn't for her, you wouldn't have forgotten to wear your monitor. The team needs your focus now. Nothing to distract you. Dom! Sonny! We need to get you watered down. The Settosa team car was stopped and searched by French police at a border crossing in the early hours of this morning. Authorities say the haul of 160 capsules of testosterone, 82 vials of human growth hormone and 234 doses of EPO was unlikely for personal consumption. As a result, the UCI will now carry out random mandatory drug testing before every stage. Keep munching those pills and drinking that water. - What the... - Who's this? Alright, alright. I'm coming. There's a doctor from the UCI downstairs. He wants to test some of the team. - Okay, stall him as long as you can. - Sonny, we'd better be okay. - What is it, mate? - UCI are downstairs. - They're here now? - Fuck! Come on, get that stuff into ya. I'm good. Meanwhile, the team soigneur and doctor have been suspended and charged with drug offences. Their solicitor has admitted that drugs were supplied to cyclists. How does it look? Still over 50%. Kiwi, you're fine. You two won't pass. Come in please. Do you see who I see? Hello, gentlemen. My name is Dr. Dirk Foegol. I'm here officially on the 12th of July 1998 at the behest of the Union of Cyclists International Blood Screening Programme. We are here to perform mandatory random testing for banned substances. This will entail extracting blood samples from three members of team Austrange. Fucking vampires! The competitors who have been randomly selected for testing here today are... Mr. Lionel Dardonne. Make your way to the testing table. Mr. Erik Schultz. And finally, Mr. Dominique Chabol. Fuck. - Mr. Chabol, are you here? - Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chabol. If you could please approach the testing table. Thank you, Mr. Dardonne. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Schultz. Arm please. You said you'd be helping us if we'd fall off our bikes. He's the boss. I do what he asks. Hold out your arm please. Okay. - . - Shit! Oh, my God! I'm so sorry. Should I...? Just leave it. Prepare another sample. - Okay. - Mr. Chabol. Foegol. One rider, one sample. Your rules. He's correct. Each rider is obliged to provide only one sample. Let's go, Dom. This is the steepest climb of the Irish leg of the tour, with only 50 kilometers to go, the gradient has split the peloton. Team Austrange at its head, protecting yellow jersey winner Tartare Marino as they make the climb up the Wicklow gap. Tar, you okay? You need to help me. I need to make pee pee. - Now? - Yeah, now. - Kiwi. - Yeah, coming. On the way. - Help me, okay? - Yeah, we got you. - Yeah. - Ah! He's pissing like a bloody racehorse. Great to see the fans out here today. Some of them in fancy dress. And keenly watching and waiting to see who will break away and take this second stage. What the fuck? Sonny, Sonny, catch up with Dom! Alright, will do. Dom! What's with Dardonne? - What? - He's bonking back there! - Who? - Dardonne! He's... he's like a fucking donkey! I'll go check. It's an attack from Stefano Drago of Settosa. He's determined to redeem himself after last year's disqualification. Dom, it's an attack! Dom! Austrange have got some work to do to catch him on the downhill slope. Ladies and gentlemen, from Luxembourg, Stefano Drago! You shit, you think about yourself! I lost because of you. And it's about the victory of the team. About my victory. Calm the fuck down, okay, he had a bad day. And where were you? I didn't see you. I lost 50 seconds because of you. You left me with the. - . I didn't see you okay? That's all... - You didn't see me? - No. - Then you go to the doctor and get eyes tested. - Okay, let's, let's go. - No, we need to resolve this. - And because of Stevie Wonder here, I lost 50 seconds! - Get in the fucking bus! - Fucking Stevie Wonder! - It's okay. It's okay. Go. Go and talk to him. -What? What? Sonny? Sonny! Sonny! Hey! Hey, Sonny! Sonny, hey! Okay, breathing. Okay, okay, okay. You're okay. Shit! Yes, emergency. There's a man on the floor. - Is he breathing? - Um, yes, he's breathing. I'm calling from the Slaney Hotel. Lynn! Lynn, it's Dom. Please open up. Lynn. Er, it's Sonny. Sorry to bother you. He's on the floor. He's sick. I don't know why. I think it's his heart. - Did you call an ambulance? - Yeah, yeah, they're on their way. Sonny? Hey? - Get some aspirin. - What? Aspirin! Surely you have aspirin? You have every other fucking drug. - I've just known him for such a long time. - How long? Thirteen, fourteen years. You know he's given up everything for cycling. His family, his friends. He's... he's so passionate about it. Like, um, I was riding up L'Alpe d'Huez this one time in the tour and... I'm in so much pain. Like... and team car pulls up to me. And Sonny pops out his head and he gives me a sandwich and... and I take out the sandwich and it's, it's wrapped in a porno mag. And... and just for this one second I forget about the pain. And he knows me so well, you know? - How is he? Can I go in? - There's not much more we can do. I'm sorry. You should spend some time with him. Thank you, Doctor. Uh, he's... Yeah. You go. I'll see you back at the hotel. Alright, big man. Thank you. I'm so sorry, Dom. I know you guys were close. He always said you'd do something special. You remember that time in Grenoble, years ago? That time you came close to winning the stage? He was hanging out the team car window, screaming and banging on the door during the race. He was heartbroken when you lost. I had to get the car doors fixed after that race. Cost me a fucking fortune. Is that for Sonny? Yeah. Hey. Got you something. - What's that? - Open it. It's a little mini you. No, no, no, he's like James Dean. You know James Dean? That's you. - From me, that's you. - You know James Dean. The batteries are in the saddle bags. It's his, uh... it's his EPO stash. - What would you like to drink? - Coffee. - Coffee. - Three coffee, one water. Hey, Dom. Sorry to break up your little party. I need to talk to you. It's important, it's about today. - Actually, we're in the middle of something. - I'm sorry, who are you? Oh, wait, the spatter. Yes, I know you. You're the doctor. No, the vampire lady. Ooh, what's going on? - Dom, are you with the enemy now, hmm? - The enemy? Excuse me. Do you love him? I mean, do you love this guy? 'Cause I'm gonna tell you this. A lot of women, they love riders. We got women everywhere. So don't let this Casanova break your balls. You remember the time that we fucked that same lady, Dom? Hmm? I mean, not together. - I was first but we did. - That's enough, Tar. It was a small race in a small town. It was a nice lady. Like a big nice lady, you know. I wink. She smiles. - We make like eye contact and it keeps on going, lap after lap. - Tar. Lap 50, I thought there was one button open here. At 51 there was another button open. I saw like a small titty coming out. I was going crazy, you know? Lap 60, I was way out in front. So think, oh, let's do something. I was alone. So I will stop beside her. We went behind some bush and I fucked her. And guess what? I still managed to win the race. You mustn't last very long. Now why don't you just fuck off! Stop! What are you doing? Is your hand okay? Such a prick. I don't know how you put up with him. What's that one from? Um, that was in the La Vuelta 1994. I smashed my shoulder. And this one? What's that from? Uh, reconstructed my shoulder blade after, um, a fall in the descent... And that? Uh, bunch sprint in the Giro. I have another scar here. It's from '78 at Antwerp. It's, um... That's your appendix. I did study medicine. You really need to start looking after yourself, Dom. Get out of this fucking circus! Lynn, I'm a domestique, okay? That's what I do. Without a bike, I'm nobody. And I'm fucking nobody. Do you want me to get that? No, it's, uh... probably my sister. - My father died four days ago and she was calling me. - Oh, my God! Dom... why didn't you say? 'Cause... I haven't spoken to my father in many years and not to my mother either. And it's not like we had a bad relationship or anything. It's just that... It's not like your family, you know? Like everybody goes to the pub together and tells their stories. And they're all together and you're all having fun. It's... it's not like that with us. So... so my sister, she calls me when we land here in Ireland. And she says, you gotta come to the funeral. I'm like, but... Aren't you going? He's your father, Dom. You need to go home. - Are you going? - Yep. I... I need to go. Lynn. That blood sample. Did you drop it on purpose? I'm sorry. It was wrong what I did, what I say, I... you know, how I am under pressure, no? Are you okay? Yeah. um... Made these armbands, you know, as a memory to Sonny. Maybe we can wear them during the race like this? Give it to me. Excuse me. Sorry, Sir! Sir. You can't wear that without prior permission of the Tour de France Executive Committee. Yeah, our soigneur died yesterday so I'd like to wear it as a tribute. Is that okay? I am sorry about your soigneur but we can't allow teams to change their uniforms without... - Viking! Viking! - What is it, Dom? Listen, there's a problem with the armband. It's just an armband. Come on. - What's the problem? - He's making a problem of the armband. Well, what happened? Unless I receive official clearance, there is no way anyone can wear armbands in any capacity. - Your team could face disqualification. - It's just a fucking armband! What if he wears it underneath his jersey as a compromise? That could work. What? Under? It's the fucking Tour de France, Dom! Our riders are ready. Let's start the countdown. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Go! The peloton departs Enniscorthy on the 200th anniversary of the 1798 rebellion in the final Irish stage of this year's Tour de France. Just turn around. Hey, guys, stay with Tar, okay? Come on, come on, come on. And Settosa have attacked, making a break from the peloton. And, oh, my goodness, Stefano Drago has just crashed. What a disaster for the current yellow jersey holder, Stefano Drago. Come on, Drago. Oh, a spectator has run onto the road, causing utter chaos. Four riders left in this incredible stage. Headed up by Dom Chabol. Tartare pulling up at the rear. Chabol glances around to make way for Tartare to sprint over the line. Don't fuck with me, Dom! But what's happening? I've never seen anything like this. Chabol is actually racing against his own team leader. Oh, and Chabol wins the stage for the first time. Dominique Chabol wins. He wins the yellow jersey! And after an amazing stage win, donning the Maillot Jaune, the yellow jersey for the first time in his long and illustrious career as a domestique, Dom Chabol revels in the glory of the winner's podium. Sporting a black armband in memory of his soigneur, Sonny McElhone, who unfortunately died of a heart attack yesterday. Sonny, an ex-rider himself, will be sorely missed by team Austrange. But today it's all about Chabol and his extraordinary victory over his own team leader. Hello? Dom? - I'm going home. - What? - I'm out. - Why? This is about you and Tartare? All families have their ups and downs. Don't quit on me now. You won a fucking stage. - I have a taxi waiting. - Dom, Dom, Dom, talk to me. I was gonna renew your contract. Take you past your 40th birthday. Not many riders get that kind of security, my friend. Not at your age. Have a think about it. What are you saying? What's the difference? Dom Chabol This is something else. Viking, what did he say? You won. You won the yellow jersey, no? We are a great team you and me, no? We're the best, simply the best. Like the song. I can't go on the bus without you. - I gotta go home. - What do you mean, go home? To do what? Like are you gonna work in a bar? Drive a taxi like that guy? Let's go to France. I'm fucking sick of this Irish place and the shit coffee. Let's go to France and win. ♪ I was blind, now I can see ♪ ♪ You made a believer Out of me ♪ ♪ I was blind, now I can see ♪ ♪ You made a believer Out of me ♪ ♪ I'm moving on up now ♪ ♪ Getting out of the darkness ♪ ♪ My light shines on My light shines on ♪ ♪ My light shines on ♪ ♪ I was lost, now I'm found ♪ ♪ I believe in you I've got no bounds ♪ ♪ I was lost, now I'm found ♪ ♪ I believe in you I've got no bounds ♪ ♪ I'm moving on up now ♪ ♪ Getting out of the darkness ♪ ♪ My light shines on My light shines on ♪ ♪ My light shines on My light shines on ♪ ♪ My light shines on My light shines on ♪ ♪ My light shines on ♪ ♪ My light shines on ♪ ♪ My light shines on ♪ ♪ My light shines on ♪ ♪ My light shines on ♪ ♪ I'm getting out of darkness ♪ ♪ My light shines on I'm getting out of darkness ♪ ♪ My light shines on I'm getting out of darkness ♪ ♪ My light shines on I'm getting out of darkness ♪ ♪ My light shines on I'm getting out of darkness ♪ ♪ My light shines on I'm getting out of darkness ♪ ♪ My light shines on I'm getting out of darkness ♪ ♪ My light shines on I'm getting out of darkness ♪ ♪ My light shines on I'm getting out of darkness ♪ ♪ My light shines on I'm getting out of darkness ♪ ♪ My light shines on I'm getting out of darkness ♪ ♪ My light shines on I'm getting out of darkness ♪ ♪ My light shines on I'm getting out of darkness ♪ ♪ My light shines on I'm getting out of darkness ♪ ♪
