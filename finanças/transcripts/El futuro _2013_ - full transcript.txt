Whispers of love, whi…, whi…, whispers… Whispers of love, whi…, whi…, whispers… Gentlemen, we have to interrupt Juan Pardo's performance because there is breaking news. Alfonso Guerra at the socialist party press conference. We must change the winds of this mistreated land. Open the windows for a new day, Spain deserves our hope. Felipe Gonzalez, general secretary, is welcomed with the socialist party's song “We must change,” the slogan of the socialist party in this campaign. “At this point of the night, according to the data it is clear that the Spanish Socialist Labor Party has obtained the support of the majority of the Spanish people in these elections. From this very moment, I want to appeal to the political forces, the institutions, the autonomous regions, provincial and local councils, unions, business corporations, the media and to every sector of national daily life so they feel integrated and support this collective mission: to consolidate democracy in Spain to overcome the economic crisis, and to build the State of the autonomous regions. No citizen should feel alienated by this beautiful mission of modernization, progress, and solidarity that we should achieve amongst us all. The collaboration of every Spaniard is essential to achieve the objective of making Spain succeed.” THE FUTURE When I'm really... I always tend to slip, I can't even articulate a word. In your look I see, ...nuclear... I stay in shape, in formalin... ...try to stimulate... When I'm really sad, I always tend to slip, I can't even articulate a word. In your look I see, a nuclear attack, I stay in shape, in formalin, behind a glass. So empty, every time that... I stay in shape, in formalin, behind a glass. So empty, every time that those lights try to stimulate love in me. So empty, every time that those lights try to stimulate love in me. -What do you want? -Beer? Yeah… My mom is a shit-scared. I'm fucking fed up of my daughter's posh school, because they're retrograde snobs… I'm fucking fed up. …a rash, or you're gonna die. That thing can't be good.” And I say: “Oh, no grandma. That can't be bad, those are improvements and all improvements are good”. The day your grandma heats a glass of milk in the microwave, that day will change her life. Oh you, you should learn, oh you, the rules of the game. Oh, oh, they didn't find the solution in the end. Oh, oh, it's not easy to be, don't you think?, a loser. Oh, oh, the clock struck the time for goodbye. Oh, oh, the end is here, with no winner. Oh you, you should learn, oh you, the rules of the game. Well, I was hospitalized, imagine, all those days… With the Americans. Let's see if they finally leave. They never leave. It's a post-coital drug, like when you cum and you... And then you grab your pillow and it's like, ahhh. And at the end you say… fuck, let's do some coke to take it up a bit. The problem is that people end up mixing everything, ecstasy makes you... ...and then your friends want to keep the party going… I'm the first to say, you shouldn't mix, you have to be careful… and I end up mixing everything. I've spent two days doing it… ...it's shit girl, don't do it, it's some liquid stuff… A friend of mine took it and I told him to tell me about it. And he got pissed off. “Why do you want me to tell you?” To know about it, I wanna know. I'm not gonna take it because I know I'll get hooked… Because if there's that many people hooked, it's gotta have something. Don't take anything but a little pill does wonders. I've been there, but since I live in Valdemorillo, I have to spend the night at my friends flat… I make plans to stay there, so my parents don't find out. It's fine, because if things don't work out with photography... Right now I'm interning, I don't know if they're gonna hire me... I don't know what's gonna happen. From Nigeria feeling hot and surrounded by mosquitoes, my transistor's out of batteries, send me lots of records. From Nigeria feeling hot, there's no bathroom in this hut. From Nigeria feeling hot I'm getting tan, It might because of the sun or it's that they've put a spell on me. From Nigeria feeling hot… I'd prefer a cold bath. From Nigeria feeling hot, there's no bathroom in this hut. Stanislavsky realized… I mean, you don't truly empathize. You empathize because you understand your character… You don't really empathize because you become that person. Listen, the mustache is the trendiest thing out there. One technique is like psychoanalysis... Girls, you have no idea of what's in and what's out. Why don't we put lipstick on that cop over there? I go out in the street with my rifle, I'm going determined to hunt a bird, I climb up to the rooftop and I start to shoot. Terrified people start to yell: Sniper! Sniper! Lemon blue vomit. The stomach wants a revenge... -Parties, organizing parties... -But what kind of job it is? The bloody bean stew relates its interference with strange convulsive contractions. In the stomach thousand battles are fought with the victorious nausea, in the large intestine a particle has been housed that ejaculates certain overripe emulsions. A corrupted smelly gas ladens my forehead with cold sweat, the inevitable is happening, repetitions in my throat, repetitions in my throat. Blue lemon vomit. Blue lemon vomit. ...and then later displaying it in cultural centers to give it some… status. And we were running but, what's going on? So, we went back there. Another crowd. Suddenly we left and we were at Neptuno but next to the Palace Hotel… Yeah, when you start running… We go to the Paseo del Prado and another wave of people… I feel a sense of movement, my body swinging in the night. Thirsty to forget my worries... We run and run... Everything was blocked off… We get to Atocha and it was cut off… No problems, just going with it. They stayed at the entrance. Nobody could leave. I saw a kid, about twenty years old, that was carrying his dad… ...bleeding all over his face, he looked terrified. Did they grab him? They had already beat him, his dad was lying there bloody as hell, the son picked him up… No problems, just going with it. We saw the cops at the door and then we started hearing... Well dude, it's that ETA also fights for our cause. -I mean, a dead cop… -They're done, they're done. No, they're not out. Listen, a fucking construction worker falls off a scaffolding and nobody cares… A fucking cop dies and everybody…, protests, prayer services, whatever. It's a fucking labor accident, you chose to be a cop. ETA is fighting for the same thing as us, you could argue with other means… But that's where the difference is, not everything goes… Right now we're arguing and I shoot you and then what? Cause' I don't like what you say. They aren't shooting “cause' I don't like what you say”. They shoot because they were shot at! They're done. The second ETA represents the majority of Basque society they can't be back-end. Majority? Why do you say majority? Well, I'm not saying it, History says it. ETA is the military vanguard of working-class struggle. What are we? The political vanguard of working-class struggle. We are at the same level. I don't know if I belong to the working-class struggle… Well, vote for the socialists, vote the socialists! …or I should dance with these… animals. Family, school, religion… I just ask one thing, if you ever see me like them, shoot me please. She's flirting with me! I thought she was talking to you, and I didn't know what to do. Should I kill her or should I let her do it? Let her do it! I like men but I do it all. Sometimes you have to take what it comes. It's just that to go down already… What a weird lighter… A granny just spoke! Susana, what horoscope sign were you? Me? Aquarius always. Read it, read it! Aquarius. Love… Awful. Well, acceptable. You mean, zero. Yeah, yeah. And what about Gemini? Love: acceptable. Health: good. Job: awful. What about Sagittarius? Read it, read it! I am the darkness around you, I am the chair you sit on, I am the eyes that look at you, and when I articulate sounds in your ear, I'm an undefined cry, a vague form. Here and there, here and there. On the wall of the universe. What about Sagittarius? I am the darkness around you, I am the chair you sit on, I am the eyes that look at you, and when I articulate sounds in your ear, I am the void that you fall into, I am the darkness. I am the void that you fall into, I am the darkness. She's from Chamberi. From Chamberi! This must be a phase because that's not flattering. Flashes in my eyes, words and words on my lips. I know you well. Suspicious situation after false information. Footsteps, footsteps behind me. People, streets, museums, galleries at night. I know you well. Secret drawings in a kaleidoscope. Voices, voices within me. We talk about us, we talk about us... ...voices talking about you. Hotels and theaters, highways, palaces at night. You know me well. My life is information, my life is information. Voices, voices talking about me. We talk about us we talk about us... Rumors about rumors, are just words. We talk about us... we talk about us... Rumors about rumors, are just words. We need more old-fashioned relationships like in the sixties. So you know who's your boyfriend. Nowadays you don't even know... Do you know who your boyfriend is? I bet you don't. Do you girls know who your boyfriend is? It's a mess, no one knows anything. You get involved with somebody and you don't know... if you're kissing a woman, or a man... YES TO NUCLEAR, OF COURSE YES TO NUCLEAR, WHY NOT! I want to bathe in seas of radium with clouds of strontium, cobalt and plutonium I want to have lead jumpsuits and mutated children riding their motorbikes. Deserted ruins with beautiful swimming pools dried out women with vampire voices starving mutants forging in the streets fresh corpses that soothe their hunger. YES TO NUCLEAR, OF COURSE YES TO NUCLEAR, WHY NOT! Burning hills of sun scorched earth and forests of light of burned skin monstrous serpents devouring houses and vast deserts covered with coals. Roaring volcanoes spewing lava and completely annihilated hotspots hidden caverns in deep beaches and valleys covered by winged flowers. YES TO NUCLEAR, OF COURSE YES TO NUCLEAR, WHY NOT! I enjoy whatever I can get, all right? I enjoy anybody that listens… I'm stupid, you're patronizing me. It's human, it's human to feel superior to others and it's OK. It's OK, Luis! I'm not ashamed of having done it with people, Luis, it's nothing bad. It's nothing bad because it's just comfortable. What's bad is what I've used against you. That's really bad! But if you've done it, in case you really have done it, it's not that bad. Cries in the jungle, dilated pupils, silent spears, simulated birds, cries in the jungle, with never-ending echoes, cries with no throat, ominously isolated. Jungle, with granite clouds, diamonds, evil spirits. Cries in the jungle, moist and dark, resonant voices, howl at the moon. Cries in the jungle. ...cries in the jungle, with never-ending echoes, cries with no throat, ominously isolated. Jungle, with granite clouds, diamonds, evil spirits. Cries in the jungle, moist and dark, resonant voices, howl at the moon. Cries in the jungle. -It doesn't taste very much, not very much. -Tastes like vanilla. Tastes a bit insipid. Not much for milk, huh? No, excuse me. I'm all for her milk. I support her milk! I'm all about her milk. I don't want you to think that I'm not, but... Excuse me honey, you sprinkled my face. Your glasses, everything… Have you done this before? You mean, sprinkle people with milk? Of course dude. -They were coming from the game... -You had a gay boyfriend I can tell! Do you remember, that thing in Malasaña? When they called all those cops, the barricades, and they kicked people out of the square. Now they've changed the closing time, bars can only open until 2 am… I wish I could swim, swim under the sea. And nothing, nothing will keep us apart. Be like dolphins forever and ever. We can be heroes just for one day. I would be... ...just for one day. I would be king and you would be the queen. And nothing would separate us, we can be us just for one day. We can be heroes just for one day. I, I can remember being with you in Berlin, and nothing, nothing would separate us. We can be us, just for one day. We can be heroes just for one day. We can be heroes just for one day. We can be heroes just for one day. We can be heroes, heroes, heroes. We can be heroes, heroes, heroes. -You're a motherfucker. -Bitch. I wish you would die and blow up… And suffer... Just like that. -Do you want more? -Me? Yeah, whatever. The shops of the future are full of micro-visible grids even though you passed by without looking. The visionary products of night of oriental acetate recover the sound of the tam-tam emerging from a mellifluous sound... Let's talk about the quaternary reptile emerging from a mellifluous sound but we won't remember the reflection of our shadow in the mirror. I want to bathe in seas of radium, with clouds of strontium, cobalt and plutonium. I want to have lead jumpsuits and mutated children riding their motorbikes. Deserted ruins with beautiful swimming pools, dried out women with vampire voices. Starving mutants forging in the streets fresh corpses that soothe their hunger. Burning hills of sun scorched earth and forests of light of burned skin. Monstrous serpents devouring houses and vast deserts covered with coals.
