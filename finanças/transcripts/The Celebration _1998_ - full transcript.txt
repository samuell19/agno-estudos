I need to borrow your bath. I mean: May I borrow your bath, please? And the sound of the sea... I'll put them down here - The main course is a secret - A secret? - You have been hunting today? - Of course Are you listening? Good It was the third time we were going to move to Copenhagen, right? But Bettina moved in with him instead - Bettina? - Yes Anyway, I'm still here, right? We went to the park yesterday I've been given the room where my sister died Well, it's better than giving it to Christian They were twins It's one thing not wanting to talk about it... but covering it all up is just silly Look... it's spooky Yes, I can see that Like a haunted home I don't think she'd like it either If we take the covers off and move the furniture a bit... Then I'll stay with her I don't mind at all - Certainly - OK This is where it happened. The bathroom Maybe I should have another room Yes, would you rather? It's just that... I'm getting really bad vibes Did you hear that? She's in the bathroom No, she's... she's dead We'll just have a look No, I think we should go No, we must look Hey, Mette, I can't find them Have you checked the suitcases? I can't find my shoes They should be in a suitcase I've looked in that one Keep your shirt on I can't go to dinner in brown shoes. Dad will go crazy! They must be somewhere I've looked everywhere I think I left them behind You didn't say that. Get it? Go back and get them. You've got two hours Take the car Stop this shit, Michael I can't see my dad in socks You expect me to go home now? What would your mother and father say? I can't go to dinner in these shoes! - Are you insane? - You could just pack your own stuff! I've packed for you, me, and the kids and you want everything to be just so If you don't like it, pack your own shit! I've got fucking news for you! You're the one who does the packing! And every single time you lose my shoes! You're the one who wanted to visit your fucking parents! I worked for a while at a cake shop Actually, I'm doing the dessert tonight What does it mean? An upward arrow? Up, up, up? If you lie in the bath, maybe you can see if there's something there The bath? You want me to lie in the bath? Shall I lie down? See if you can spot anything A sign or another arrow A wave or a fish or a bird. Kind of like Getting Warmer - It's just not good enough - I'm sorry I'd just ironed this I said I was sorry Shall we... shall we lie down for five minutes? What about the party? We'll just lie down for five minutes, right? There's a fish! It means flat, which means down I'm not sure I understand this game Oh dear... How strange! We always played it. Getting Warmer Come on... Sit down Check next to the other leg How sweet of her to have done this... I can hardly bear it I'm the only one still stuck here The rest of you go swanning off to Paris and... You can't sit here crying I'm sorry Have one of these Just say if you want me to go Didn't you want a bath? An arrow again And another arrow Will you... - Will I what? - Undo me Look, I've still got a good ass. Is a bath all it's going to get? Up there, look! - On the other side - Where? Next to the bulb "To whoever finds this letter. You are probably..." - Bloody hell! - It doesn't say anything Mette, damn it! Did you leave this soap here? This pisses me off! - Michael - Why did you leave the soap here? You're the one who used it, prick Shit! - Did you hurt yourself? - I certainly fucking did! There have always been ghosts in this house It doesn't say anything I'll happily stay here. Thanks for your help You were really frightened? Not at all A bit? I'm sorry. Thanks for your help Why the hell did you leave the soap there? I didn't, you did - I didn't - You're the one who used it last - Where are my pants? - I don't know. Over there! You should take care of your things - I'm not your babysitter - Shut up! Jesus! Oh, for God's sake! The fucking thing's fallen down now. Shit! - You'd better put it up again - Bollocks! It's weird. You were always the wild one, getting into fights Now it's your brother You can't even be bothered to look at a pretty girl any more Maybe you think I'm too skinny Christian? I'll put it in here. They mustn't find it... Done Where have you gone, lovely Christian? It's six o'clock. Time to get up! Cards, please! Tickets, please! Or other proof of travel... My trousers! - Hi, Grandpa! - Hi, Dad I'll see you in the lounge in five minutes! These fucking shoes... Hi, Bent! Be cool Hi, Poul, how's tricks, you old bastard? Hi, Dad Later, my boy... we're going in now It's about... I've been asked to inquire whether you are interested in the Lodge I don't see you as one of the brethren, I must say But Christian has told Preben you're doing well And as Christian is not interested you may expect to be invited to join the Freemasons Strike while the iron is hot. This may be your only... He could make something of himself... We have to help you get on But try to behave like a normal human being tonight, alright? Keep your hands off what's-her-name... Michelle? I'd like you to hover about, keep things running smoothly Can you manage that? You, you're supposed to serve drinks. Get a move on, will you? Go on, move! Have you got a drink? We need to talk I can't right now You do remember something, don't you? - Yes, certainly - Jolly good I was thinking of saying a word or two this evening I thought as much It won't be anything fit for little girls I bet it won't You fell asleep Aren't you sleeping properly? Only with you It's a great honour for me to act as toastmaster this evening for the Klingenfeldt-Hansen family My name is Helmuth Von Sachs Yes, I am from Deutschland Cologne, the Ruhr, the steelworks And also Helge is a man of steel. Still going strong Helge, mein Freund, mein danishes Vater, over to you Seeing you all reminds me so clearly of the years gone by... and of all that's happened to us There's nothing special about turning sixty It's not a big deal It seems like yesterday when we concluded the final negotiations for the take-over of this unique place Yet it was way back in the summer of 1971 when my young family walked up these steps My dear wife, Helene, Michael, and the twins... The twins... Ready to move into this beautiful estate We were so... We were so full of expectations I'll stop there I'll stop there and hope that we will have a lovely party together Let's eat! First course. Ready... Go! Over and out - Did you enjoy the drive? - No, it was very hot in the car You've got air conditioning, Bent Yes, but it dries your mouth up - It really is most unpleasant - Really? The kids are here too Give me some water! May I have some water, please? I'm all wet... - What's your name, lass? - My name is Mette - M. E. T. T. E. Mette - That's right, yes, Mette I said it's lobster soup... lovely! No, it's salmon soup Salmon? I think it tends more towards lobster - It's delicious, this soup - Yes. Tomato soup No, definitely not tomato. It's lobster soup - Yes - Yes, lobster soup... cheers! "Eldest son's speech"... Ready, Morten? It's nearly seven o'clock and I should like to propose the first toast, it being my duty as the eldest son - Correct, Helmuth? - Absolutely But first, a speech I've written two, Father One is green, the other is yellow. You choose - Green? Yellow? - I'll take the green The green is an interesting choice, it's a kind of home truth speech I've called it "When Dad had his bath" I was very young when we moved here Things changed completely for us We had all the space we wanted and we filled it with as much trouble as we could cause This room was a restaurant then I can't count the times my sister Linda, who is now dead and I played in here She would put things in people's food without their noticing We would hide and watch. Then she would begin to laugh She had the most infectious laugh you can imagine In no time at all we'd both be howling with laughter and we'd get caught But nothing ever happened to us It was much more dangerous when Dad had his bath I don't know if you remember, but Dad was always having baths He'd take Linda and me into the study... as there was something he had to do first Then he'd lock the door and roll down the blinds Then he'd take his shirt off and his trousers and make us do likewise He'd lie us across the green couch that's been thrown out now... and abuse us sexually. He raped us. Had sex with his little ones Christian! A couple of months ago, when my sister died I realised that Helge was a very clean man, with all those baths I thought I'd share it with the rest of the family Baths. Summer, winter, spring, autumn, morning, evening... Really, Helge's a very clean man I just wanted you to know that seeing as we're celebrating his sixtieth What a guy! Imagine living a long life and watching your children grow up! And grandchildren! But you didn't come to listen to me We've come to celebrate Helge's sixtieth, so let's do so Thank you for all those wonderful years Happy Birthday! I have nothing to drink. Fill our glasses! Christian, you were the first but now it's my tum Elsie, it is your birthday It's Helge's! What did he say? He said it's Helge's birthday, Grandad Helge, it's your birthday, and that's good You're a big boy now. Your ears can take a story from across the seven seas Nice one, Grandad! I have to go When Helge was a young lad he told me he had trouble finding ladyfriends - Hello, Christian - Kim... I've got a plane to catch Stop, everybody! May I introduce my boyhood buddy, Christian You know most of them Christian, how are you? - I'm fine - You're fine? Well done, Christian You've made your speech and now you're going home The battle's lost. Nothing's changed Over Are you drunk? How else could I cook? - How long have we known each other? - A long time Since Year One? We scrumped apples together I've been waiting for this ever since, and you just run away From your father, who drew lots for you and your sister A brilliant start to your speech. Drawing lots like your father What do you want, Kim? Sorry to interrupt, Grandad I just want to say that I hope none of you took Christian seriously He is my brother and I love him dearly But what he said wasn't true. And I should know, right? Sorry for interrupting. I'm a little shocked At 7.15 your father'll come down to give me a time for the main course "I think they like the food", he'll say, as usual And he'll have his usual glass Just give me two minutes I thought you'd gone Come here! Bring a schnapps for me and my son - That was splendid - Thank you I think they like the food Have some schnapps - No, thanks - Really? That tastes good. Damned good! I do believe it's damned good Have one yourself Come with me Alone Off we go! Well, how are you? I'm fine Are you? Are you sure? Well, I don't understand this My memory must be failing me. Age, probably What do you mean? What you talked about I don't recall any of it. You'll have to help me What happened exactly? Sorry it's probably me who got it wrong Don't apologise or you'll really have me worried I'm just a bit stressed out at the moment with work... and my sister Forget it What you were telling us is a crime. I think we should call the police No, don't do that Just forget it I'm not sleeping well. I'm feeling a bit weird. Sorry Are things going well upstairs? Yes, fine, fine It takes more than that to shake them Have a good trip home. It was nice seeing you They're waiting for me - Helge, it's your birthday - Grandad, not again! You're a big boy now Your ears can take a story from across the seven seas When Helge was a young lad he told me he had trouble finding ladyfriends I told him, "Listen, lad!" "Just buy a big potato and stuff it down your swimming trunks Go down to the lake and they'll come running!" Anyway, summer came... - What do you think? - Me? I don't know what he's planning He came back in despair and told me things were far worse now Nobody would talk to him "No wonder", I said. "You should have put the potato down the front of your trunks" For he's a jolly good fellow! Michelle! Pia! A word Michelle come here, Pia come here. A word We'll steal their car keys. Over - What? - Us? It's Christian's turn tonight. People mustn't go home yet. Over I don't think he intends to say any more. He apologised Let's wait and see. Don't tell the old waiters They need their pensions Off you go. Now! We mustn't leave any traces No, no, we'll be careful I've got it! Next room ls everything OK? There aren't any problems? No, no. Everything is OK ls my brother staying the night? I don't really know A taxi? I'll check it out Hey, Charlie Brown! You've come to the wrong place Can I go? Just a moment Listen, Sambo. I don't know where you met my sister... - Michael, what are you doing? - What the hell do you mean? What the hell are you doing? Mind your fucking manners! How dare you drag some monkey to Dad's party? - Are you calling Gbatokai a monkey? How dare you? - Chill out You Nazi bastard! OK. Push off! Mum, hang on. This is my boyfriend, Gbatokai Mum, you haven't met him before. That was someone else Forgive me for disturbing you again. But I forgot the most important bit We're here for my father's birthday, not anything else If I led you up the wrong track earlier, I'd like to make amends by proposing a toast to my father - Please stand - Well done, Christian Raise your glasses! Here's to the man who killed my sister. To a murderer I'd like to propose an interval Cigarettes! Quick! Play something Nice and quiet Play something No, let's stay a while. We can't just leave Christian, are you crazy? Christian, can you hear me? Are you crazy, Christian? Make sure nobody goes home He's sick... sick, damn it! For the last time! I have phoned... - Get me a taxi - Just a moment I can't take it. I already suffer from depression We can't leave! There are no taxis here - Fine, then I'll walk - Alright, let's walk! "Here comes the Danish summer". I've had it with these gatherings - Bent, have you seen the car keys? - No, I haven't We're leaving but I can't find our car keys - Problems? - I can't take it The number you're calling is still engaged - There is an eleven month wait - May I speak to Kim? Lars, just take it easy, OK? Hide those car keys! In the oven In the fridge All gone! Where the hell is Michelle? Come in, damn it Michael, I want a word with you, too You must leave No. We're going to talk now - Mette, you must hear that too - We're going to talk, come on! In here. Come on - Let go of me - Calm down, alright? - OK, what do you want? - Last year... You came on to me and now you won't even give me the time of day I'm sorry, right? Damn it... I've got my wife here It's funny, she's never been that important before You know I got pregnant? Don't worry, I got rid of it. I just thought you should know Listen, it's my old man's 60th and things are going crazy Hi, Bent. Bloody hell. Is this your room? I was just leaving. Seen my car keys? I'll have a quick look, OK? Sure you haven't seen them? I'll get really depressed if I don't find them I know, I know. Bent, run along downstairs Pack up your stuff and get out, right? Here's your wages. Now just fuck off, understand? You're as fucked up as your Dad Don't ever talk about my family! What if I got up and said a couple of words instead? About you? About how sick you were as a child? About the way you always spoiled things for the other children? Making them watch as you burnt their toys The warped character you've always been? About how we had to go to France to rescue you from that sanatorium where you lay sick in the head, as ever, pumped full of drugs to your mother's despair I could also mention your lack of talent with women Lovely women you let go by, year after year because there is so little man in you. Christian I could also make a speech about you and your sister What do you say to that? Did she ever say goodbye to you? No. Was there a card? A letter? No. Nothing There was for the rest of us And maybe there was a reason why Because you just left as usual Abandoned your sick sister She kept asking for you Rushing to the phone every time it rang. But it was never you As ever, you were only interested in yourself and your sick mind Now you sling mud at the family that only ever wanted the best for you Your mother wants you to go and never come back But I think you should stay right here Feel what it means to spit in your family's face After... After that little intermezzo pianissimo I think we should return to the dinner table lch Haber Hunger Ladies and gentlemen... They're back! Christian isn't very happy Right! Venison and cranberry, go! Cheers, Grandad! It was a superduper speech You keep yelling into my ear Grandad, cheers again Salt and pepper! Cheers! Champagne! We must have Champagne! And caviar! If the birthday boy is my danishes Vater, Elsie is my danishes Mutter Everyone's Mother! Elsie, over to you Give her a hand! Thank you, Helmuth. Thank you all I want to say how much I appreciate your coming today I also want to say a word or two to thank my husband, my Helge Though it may be hard to find the words to describe what you have meant and still mean to me But with your appetite for life and infinite love for your family, you have given me everything a wife could wish for We've had thirty wonderful years. Thank you! I think I'll take the opportunity to say a word or two to my children I think it is fantastic to see how well you have done, especially when I consider how little you once were Michael, You are our youngest, our little baby Not that we've seen that much of you You were away from home from an early age First, boarding school Then away at sea Then catering college in Switzerland You never became a chef but who knows? At any rate you have given us three splendid grandchildren for whom your father and I are so grateful And of course we thank your little Mette Helene, the family loner You really are, Helene Ever since you informed us that you'd decided to become a singer and had joined the Trotsk... the Young Socialists, I think it was... We always knew you would choose your own path And you certainly have In life as well as your studies You've ended up in anthropology Most interesting. Though your father and I always hoped you'd chose Law But goodness, I can't begin to count the number of foreign countries and their unfortunate inhabitants with whom you've had contacts Speaking of which, I'd like to extend a warm welcome to Gonzales Mummy, his name is Gbatokai Welcome, Kai! Then there is you, Christian You have always been quite special A creative child The stories Christian could tell when he was small! I always thought you'd make a really good author one day When Christian was small, for all of you who don't know, he had a loyal companion called Snoot who didn't exist But Snoot and Christian were inseparable If Snoot didn't like something, neither did Christian If you were the one at the receiving end, there was nothing you could do about it But dear Christian... It is so important to be able to distinguish fact from fiction I think you've always had trouble doing so Of course you can be angry with your father I am sometimes, too But it has to be sorted out in private Telling stories like those you've told this evening however exciting they may be... and they were exciting... is going a bit too far Christian, I think that Snoot has been with you today and I think you both rather upset your father So I think it would be appropriate if you stood up, leaving Snoot in his seat, and gave your father an apology It won't belittle you in any way to say you're sorry It would be quite alright Christian, you may stand up now Come on, Christian. Get your fucking act together! - He's sick in the head, Mum - Christian? I'm sorry to disturb you again In 1974 you, my mother, came into the study to see your son on all fours and your husband with no pants on I'm sorry you saw me like that Yet you left the room when your husband ordered you out I'm sorry you're so hypocritical and corrupt that I hope you die I'm sorry that you're all such cunts that you believe her I'm sorry that for thirty years, Your husband Let me finish! I haven't finished! Christian, cool it. Come on. Out! - I want my coat - You can have your coat You were away at boarding school. What the fuck do you know? But you know anyway! - You're way out of line! - You know anyway! - Don't you? - You've gone too far! Out of my way! Lock the door! Is it locked? I think so In the deep, deep forest peace Where songsters dwell Where my soul did hearken many a time To the birds' happy song Where was I? Mother, my loyal witness! In 1974 you entered the study... - and saw my father's stiff dick rubbing my hair - You bastard! You bastard! He is not well It's very sad... Mother, please continue There is such an idyll, such peace and calm in the sylvan solitude That all sorrows are stilled Where peace and rest do reign Get out of here, you bastard! Fuck off! Leif, stop that, damn it! He's my brother Christian, come here! The game's over, get it? Have you had enough, man? Not that! He's my brother - Come on, get rid of him - Where? - In the woods - We've got to stop this shit! - How far? - Just get rid of him - What do you mean, "get rid of him"? - Shut up! Over here We'll leave him by that tree That's the way. Come on Do we really have to tie you to a tree, Christian? What the hell made you talk such shit? - Is he tied up? - I'm through now Calm down now Easy does it Take it easy, Christian Leif, have you got a cigarette? I dropped mine I'll check all the doors I don't want to talk to him What have you done to him? Relax I talked to him. He's gone home. He's very sorry So let's take it easy. We'll talk about it later You want trouble? Stop it, Michael! Michael, stop it! That's enough! Back off! - Hi there, Kim - Hi, Leif We need to lock the back door - Where is it? - Right over here - A bad business - Yes You didn't kill him, or anything? He won't be back - This way? - In here - This is the wine cellar. - Yes. Over Cut it out, Kim What the hell is this? - You locked him in? - Yes We can't have his type running around Hands off! - Kim, where's Christian? - No idea Stop drinking, Michael What did you say? Why don't you make a speech? Right, let's get things swinging! A little sing-song I saw a real Black Sambo His face was black as pitch He spoke all funny And had a ring in his nose I asked him: "What are you?" "Why are your legs covered in tar?" He just laughed and said: Tomrassi gassi bom! I saw a little Indian His face was as red as fire. He spoke all funny I can't stand this! They'll kill each other! I'm going crazy! I've got such a headache Will you get my tablets? - Have you seen Christian? - No, he's gone home It's for the best I'll get your tablets You're all crazy - You're still capable... - Oh yes For longer than you think, Helge It's nearly 10 o'clock and something exciting is about to happen As Alfred Hitchcock suggested for his gravestone: "This is what happens to naughty little boys" Helge, you're not getting out of the family tradition The grand finale! It's Daddy's birthday! It really is today Daddy's birthday today! Now listen to the way we blow the trumpet! It's Daddy's birthday today! Listen to the way we play the flute! You dropped something! You should be more careful Helene... you're not going already? So soon? - I want to go home now - Don't be silly It's time for dessert I love these family traditions After the dance around the house a note appears on the toastmaster's glass and here is what it says: "A certain man urges his sister to read letter to his father" A letter I think Helene is too shy. Right, Helene? In any case... it is kind of your brother to help you get started And it seems that there is peace in the family again So let's give Helene a hand - Come on - Come on, Helene Don't be shy! Michael, ignore him! It's... It's from my sister "To whoever finds this letter..." "ou are probably my sister or one of my brothers" "Because you can play Getting Warmer" "Nudge, nudge!" "I know you will be sad to find me" "in a bath full of water" "But it isn't so sad for me" "I know my brothers and sister" "are happy, radiant people," "and that I love you" "And I think you should just forget me" "Christian, my beloved!" "Who has always been with me! Thank you for everything" "I don't want to mix you up in this. I love you too much for that" "And you, Helene.
