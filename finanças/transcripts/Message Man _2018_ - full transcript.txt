We need more workers and they want more money. You know the one thing that I hate most in this world? Waiting. I understand, sir. But they need more time... It's unfortunate that what they want and what they get is two different things. Cut all their wages in half. Cut in half, sir... As I just said, everyone gets half. With all due respect... Then, next week, and they all have quit, they will come begging for work. We'll give them a raise. I say, what, 25 percent? You... need to give yourself an opportunity to be a nice guy for once.

I'm sick of this little game. You will not waste my chance. I need you to be a smart man now and seep these next word to your fucking tiny, little skull, you fucking wait 'til I say! Is everything alright? I found something. Something... I've wanted for a very long time. How long you look? Many... ...many years. What is this thing? A man. A murderer. And why you want him so bad? He killed my parents. How did he do it? This had to happen. I've killed too many. Their bodies were on the floor. Blood everywhere. They call him the "Message Man." I thought he was going to kill me too. It's my time now. We'll see how he likes losing things. Tom. Why? The money. I needed the money. It's been quiet out there. Kids are getting married. My goddamned mortgage. The kids. All grown up. Trish is married now for god's sakes. Got a granddaughter. And Lucy? We're divorced. Hey, 20 good years out of it. All good things come to an end, right? So... where does that leave us, friend? Tell me about Lee. He got wind you were here. He's like a kid with a fucking toy now. And how many? Jesus Christ, it's fucking hot here. What are you doing out here anyways? This fucking place is a shithole. It stinks, mosquitoes, bad water, thousand fucking islands. Wait, wait. Please. The other players. Uri? We just met. Third guy is a Jap. Chinese or some shit like that. He's been getting all the big gigs over the last couple years. Listen, this guy doesn't play by the same set of rules. And he's here now. Yeah. And the pirates, the work for Lee? Yeah. Hey... I can walk away. Disappear. Completely off the grid. I tried that. What was it like being alone for so long? Lonely. I'll keep an eye on them for you. Thanks. Do they know about the family? Yeah. Something tells me I'm just the distraction now. What's your granddaughter's name? Suzie. She's the most beautiful thing... Send them now. Okay. Oh, shit! Jenti? Jenti. Why are they here, Mr. Ryan? Why they take my babies away? Why me? Ryan, welcome back. Did you like my gift? I asked them to be creative and I hope they did their job well. You know what I want. I will give you one chance, to bring them back to me unharmed. See you in Jakarta. Two hours or I kill them both. Just sleep. It's okay. I'm gonna get your kids. I'll get 'em back. Yes? Lee! Why the fuck is this here? To kill you, I suggest. You said that he will come for you. Well I say he come for all of us. No, no, fucking game. I will kill him myself. Then I will kill your girls, then I will kill you. You fucking with me? Good luck with that. Lee? Lee? Fuck! Due to time constraints, I won't be able to stay very long. That being said, I feel under the circumstances, I owe it to some people I've become very close to. To give you my fullest attention. Please, don't kill me. This is not an exercise in torture. Nor is it a lesson.
