- Hello dori? - Hi mom! - Aunt Sophie's back home! - Hey that's great, I'm really glad to know aunt Sophie's out of that hospital. Even though she lives in Florida and I've only met her twice. - Don't you care about your family? - Of course I care about the family. - Well what are you gonna do tonight? - Uh, I guess I'm just gonna stay home tonight. Yeah, you know, watch some TV and rest. - Alone? - Yeah alone! - Well I'm alone too. - Yeah we're two lonely people. - I'll come right over. - Um, not tonight mom. I'll see you tomorrow. - You never want to see me. Don't you care about your mother anymore? - Of course I do! - I love you! - Well I love you too, mom! And I'll see you tomorrow, okay? - I coming up tomorrow and I'm - uh huh. - Gonna rearrange your life. - Yeah. - I have a lot - yes. - Of ideas that I think I should throw against the wall. - Yeah. Look mom we'll talk about it tomorrow, okay? Okay, 'night. - The city's fifth rape-murder victim of the month was just found this morning, leading police to speculate that we may have a mad killer-rapist prowling our streets. Each of the victims has been strangled to death and there have been similarities of sexual abuse and disposition of the bodies. Women in the Los Angeles area are urged to use caution when venturing outside, most especially after dark. Now on a somewhat more positive note, the weatherman has promised another beautiful day today with a civic center high of 82, dipping down to an overnight low of 66. - Pardon me, I'm a photographer scouting for new models... - And that's it for another edition of kvla news. What's up doc? - Yeah did you put 'em to sleep again? - You bet I did. Hang on, coming up. Good morning, welcome to the last segment of kvla's dayline, hosted by Dr. Lindsay Gale. Dr. Gale is a practicing psychologist licensed by the state board of medicine. - Here's my card if you'd like to have me take your photographs. - Hey what do you think you're doing? I've been sitting around the corner in the car waiting for half an hour. - Okay I was standing here waiting for you. - Yeah talking to some creep. Come on, let's go. - She's authored two books on abnormal psychology. In keeping with station policy, we ask callers not to disclose their personal identities. And now, Dr. Gale. - Thank you and good morning out there. Before we begin again I'd like to remind you that this program is not designed to treat people with serious mental illnesses. I can't provide in-depth therapy over-the-air so, in these few short hours I try to deal with people who are facing a temporary problem or two. And remember, any subject is fair game, sex, marriage, children, whatever. Good morning you're on-the-air with Lindsay Gale! - My name is Cathy. My little boy ties up his toys in ropes and chains and throws them against the wall. - Sounds like a very angry young man. - He also cut up his goldfish with scissors and he threatened to do the same thing to his little sister. Do you think I should do something about his behavior? - I'm going to put you with Fred and he will refer you to a therapy group who can help you. Thank you. Good morning you're on-the-air with Dr. Lindsay Gale. - Hello Dr. Gale! '(O soy Ramona! How are you! I called you last week! - Of course the man with the headaches. How are you feeling today? - I feel real good. - Fine. Did you see a doctor about those tests we talked about? Ramona'? - I mean it's all right, 'cause, I'm-a lots better now! - I'd like to believe that, but you don't sound better to me. Please consider what we discussed last week, will you do that for me ramone? - But I do feel better! I have found the answer to my problems! Ptha! A nurse, you know, a real good woman. - That's very fortunate for you ramone. However I don't think that a relationship with a woman is exactly what you're needing right now. Tell me how does she feel about the problem? Ramona'? Hello ramone? Ramona! - Carter? - Yes sir! - Get me a shot of this. - Yes sir. - Did you get a shot of that breast? - Which one? She's got two you know. - The one that was nearly bitten off, god-dammit. Give me a mold of that breast, 'cause I want to take some tooth impressions. - Hey, I already have. Very healthy lady. - Hey you're a very funny man but the last thing I need in my life right now is a comedian, okay? Now was she sexually assaulted? - Whoo, every orifice she's got. - Anything else? - Well I got a sperm sample, I got a sample of his skin that was underneath her fingernails. And I got six pieces of hair, it looks like four from his head and I got a couple of pubics. - Pubic hairs. Hey McCabe. That candy wrapper that was found, is that the same brand kogen and mcclosky found at the first murders? What do you got babe? - A piece of burnt cardboard from a film box. In the ashtray here. Carter? - Yes sir! - Look around for a camera, will you? - Yes sir! - Hey, make a note on those stockings, see if it's the same brand found at the first murders. The knot looks the same. - Oh... What's with this hatch? - Oriental style, popular with the viet cong. But what I can't figure out, is why bother with the coin. - Hatch the coin's obvious. The girl's response is probably simulated sexual excitement, so he just twists the stocking, on and off, back and forth like a water faucet. He must have kept her squirming for several minutes. - That sick son of a bitch. Maybe we're looking for a Vietnam vet? - Could be. - Great, we got his pubic hairs, now we can match them with every known vet in L.A. and get our man. - I want this bastard. - Hello Carl. - Hi Dr. Gale. Can I see you today? - Uh, I have someone coming in right now, can you wait? - Okay- - okay great, come on in. - At uh, at night he'd hang around, and watch me undress, and, and then he'd touch me. - And you let him? Do you always, did you always let your father have his way even though you felt it was wrong? Yes. I'm sorry. He'd yell at me, you know... And I, and I, I couldn't stand to have him get mad at me and yell, , I couldn't stand it. - Do you still give in and go out of your way to avoid conflicts and arguments? - Mm hmm, yeah, I uh, I can't uh, yeah I can't, yeah I get nervous. And, uh, I can't stand it when somebody gets angry with me, I just get very frightened. - It's the problem area you have to work on. You must learn to assert yourself. You have to believe that your feelings do count, and that what you feel does matter, and that you have a right to express what you feel. - I'm trying. - No trying's not good enough, you have to really truly care about yourself Carol. You should learn to do good things for yourself. You deserve it. - I think I deserve you. Assert myself, yeah. - Our time's up for today. - Okay- - will you set up your next appointment with sue? - For next week? - Yeah. - Same time? Okay. - Okay? And have a good day. - Oh I will. - All right. Assert yourself! Right. - You know, now is a really good time to have a strangler on the streets. I can really use the money this month. Only you know what, I bet the guy lives in Fresno. I bet he's out of town. I bet he just comes in oh maybe a couple of times a week to have a good time, get drunk, kill a couple of people , you know what I mean? - Would you take your feet off of my desk? - In a minute Gladys. You probably haven't noticed, but I'm resting. - In two minutes I'm gonna break both your legs! The way I have it figured, he knocked somebody off last night, and so the city's safe for three, four, five days. They can sleep well tonight Gladys. Tonight there is no problem. - No-o-o-o... - It's all right, don't be scared. - No-o-o-o, no... - You're daddy's little girl. - Yeah don't hurt me... - And daddy loves his little girl. - Don't hurt me. Do-o-o-o-n't... - Shhh! Daddy wants his girl. - Nooooo... You're gonna hurt me... - Nobody's gonna hurt you. I'm not gonna hurt you. Why I love you. It's all right. - I'll do anything! - I know you will, you'll do everything. - Noooo! - Oh, you're so pretty. Oh, it's all right, it's all right. It's all right. Your skin has gotten so, so white, and beautiful. You're just so lovely, you're just so lovely. Oh, ooo, you're so beautiful. - Not that! - No no no no, it's all right, daddy's here, daddy's here, daddy's here to protect you. Daddy loves his little baby. Daddy wants his little baby. - Daddy. - Oh yeah, oh yes. Oh yeah. - Shhh... - What are you doing! - In honor of the father. - Nooooo! Nooooo! Nooooooo! - From the murder last night we have even more reason to believe the killer may have a confused sense of religious values, may see himself as acting out certain purifying, and cleansing rituals, with the victim. Now a scientific description of the strangler's type behavior would be paranoid, obsessive, compulsive, psychotic, schizophrenic. This can probably be attributed to an important early figure in his life, most likely a dominant female. - Excuse me doctor. We can't rely on all this mumbo-jumbo psycho crap! - Well excuse me, am I boring you? - No of course not. Do you have anything else you'd like to say? - Eh, no, that's all, for now. - We'll continue these meetings at a later date. Thank you. Welcome to the strangler task force. I want you all to pay attention, the chief has arranged for the top people in our departments to be here today. Sargent hatcher and I have been to these murder sites and they are gruesome. We've been appointed as number one team. Hatch? - Smith, compile a complete list of all the murder victims. Their employment history and where they banked. Castle, check out all store billings, dental and medical. Williamson, I want you to read everything the news media prints or has printed regarding this case. And Clark, check out cab pick up and drop lists. Sherman, you and your partner follow up thoroughly on all imitators and confessors. Tarino, follow up on laundry dry cleaning marks and labels. Green, set up a 24-hour hotline. If there are any questions regarding this meeting, you bring them to sargent hatcher's attention or mine. Now let's go get him! Now let's go hutch. More late hours. - There goes my date this Saturday night. Huh! - Recognize this young lady? ~ oh! It's Carol ridulch. It's quite a shock you brought me today, how can I help? How can I help you? - Well I'd like to know a little more about her. Her, uh, men friends, family, what kind of job she had. Living pattern. Do you have a file that I could see? - A therapeutic file is out of your province. - Even if I have a court order? - You'll have to. I can tell you that she was a shy, withdrawn girl. She was alone, no family or nuptial ties. - Don't you give a shit about getting this strangler off the streets? - What would you prescribe for the man, a firing squad? - That's not a bad idea. Mainly I don't want him back on the streets in a few years, or sooner, if some misguided shrink discovers he can find his ass in the dark with both hands. - Lieutenant, truthfully, I think it's people with the mentality like yours that are responsible for creating troubled people like the strangler. - Truthfully doctor, I was hoping for more cooperation. Here's a show cause writ, from judge silverman, notarized this morning. Keep it, it belongs to you. I'll need those files, now. - Fuck off! - Bitch! - Wow, so this is what a photography studio really looks like. - More coffee? - No thanks. I can't believe I'm this lucky. I'm in L.A. two weeks and I get picked up hitchhiking by a photographer who needs a model. My friends back in Indiana are gonna be knocked out when they see me on the cover of a magazine. It's all like a dream to me, really. - Yes, it is like a dream. You know, sue Ellen, hitchhiking in California can be very dangerous. I think you should be careful, honey. - You're telling me! One guy stopped and asked if I'd give him head. Imagine, I mean, that would never happen back in Indiana. But I can trust you, huh? - Of course you can. Now, why don't you go in there and get dressed, and I'll fix up the studio. There are a few things I have to take care of, then, then we'll get started. - All right! - That's good, enjoy it, enjoy it, oh yeah, oh yeah, beautiful. Honey you're a natural. You are a natural. I love it, I love it. Easy, good good, good, good, wet your lips. Wet 'em, wet 'em, wet 'em, wet 'em, wet 'em... Good. Down, chin down. That's right. Wet your lips a little more. Okay... Now, okay take a break. Good sue Ellen, good girl. Good girl, I'm proud of you, you are a natural. Let me see, hair looks good, okay, let's do the part when your caught, all right? - What's that for? - Oh, this is how they transport prisoners. I'm just gonna pull these down, nothing's gonna show, nothing's gonna show. Gang girl always wears her leather jacket out, and this, goes under there. - You must do a lot of research for this kind of thing. - My dear, sue Ellen, this is the secret to my success. Lots and lots of research. Okay... Let me get those handcuffs for you, I don't want you to be hurt now, okay? This goes in here, okay? Gonna go real easy. - No, I'm okay. This is gonna be wild. - For real, that's what they want, they want the most bizarre shots in the whole world. I can't believe it. Okay let me back you up under the light honey. - Is this spot good? - Oh yeah, oh that's perfect, that is perfect. Hair's good, all right. Okay. - What's that all about? - Oh this project asks for a religious motif. It's really not... - Um, I think you better give me the keys, for these okay? - The keys? - Yeah, where are the keys for these? - Oh here if you want 'em! Oh, lovely... Oh... Oh I like you. Oh I love you. Oh I love it! I love it! - This one's enough to make me vomit. - They all are. It's the stranglers m.O. All right. But now we know that he uses a stocking from the previous victim. - Hey that's great, now we got him on petty theft, along with murder. - No attempt to conceal the body. It's almost like he wanted her to be discovered. Well we'll get a recognizable picture of her face and get it to McCabe and hatcher for a quick ID on the street. - McCabe and hatch. Those bozos. If it was up to me, I'd fire 'em. - You're gonna have to come to terms with your drug problem, Lisa, that's real important. - I just can't help that. That's... It's a vicious circle. - Look Lisa, um, there's a lot more to it than that, okay? I want you to try something for me. I want you to close your eyes. Come on just close your eyes. Okay, good, now, um, I know that you care for me, but I want you to tell me that the drugs are more important than me. - Oh come on I really don't feel that way. - I want you to say it anyway. And I want you to tell your boyfriend, I want you to tell him that you love the drugs more than you love him. Now go ahead. Try it. - Doctor Gale, the drugs are more important than you. - All right now tell you boyfriend, go ahead, louder. - Marty, the drugs are more important than you. - All right try it again, louder, I want you to tell me again. - Dr. Gale, the drugs are more important than you. - Now your parents, much louder. - Mom, dad, the drugs are more important than you! - All right we're starting to get there. Tell your boyfriend. - Marty, the drugs are more important than you! - All right Lisa now I want you to tell me again, I want you to say it louder. - Dr. Gale, the drugs are more important than you! - All right, now tell your parents, louder! - Mom, dad, the drugs are more important than you! - All right get it out again, louder! - Mommy, daddy, the drugs are more important than you! - Louder Lisa! - Oh, Marty, the drugs are more important than you! The more... They're more important than everything. They are. - Okay, that's pretty good Lisa. Okay now you know that you can help yourself. Because you do know now that the drugs are much more important than anything. Okay? Lisa you should feel good about yourself, that's a major breakthrough. - Yes sir, yes sir! McCabe, I got a deal for you. I just talked to daley. He's sending us a psychic. - Come on! - I mean it, a real psychic. I mean, this guy's supposed to be good. He senses magnetic vibrations, and he can see things in places he's never been. - McCabe here. - I am Mr. Demetrius. - Hatchet. - Good afternoon detectives. - That's one for one. - I sense you are not happy with this meeting, that you think nothing will come of it. - Two for two. - We shall see what we shall see. Your ex-wife, Kathleen, didn't like your sense of humor either. Would you please give me the photograph of the victim. In your desk drawer. I must have something to touch from the scene of the crime. - This is a photograph of the strangler's last victim. - I see... A woman, trying to get away. A man grabs her, he's, he's a big man. He has short curly hair, like little wires. He has big lips, and big arms, he's a very big man. He hits her. He, he tears off her underwear and stuffs it in her mouth. He's taking a stocking from his pocket, the stocking is from another victim. Now he puts, he puts a coin on her throat, he wraps the stocking around her neck, and he's choking her while he enters her. Now he, now he caresses her. He has, he has an orgasm, on her stomach, now he's taking off her stocking, now he's pushes her legs very wide apart. And he's, he's photographing her. He's photographing her again. Now he's leaving. She's dead. - Hatch. - Huh? - Read him his rights and book him. He knows too much. - Boy you sure made an asshole of yourself when you busted that psychic. I thought daley was gonna have a heart attack when you told him. Imagine, busting his wife's psychic! Hey, how were you supposed to know that he was on world tour and 7000 miles away when the murders happened, huh? - Very nice. Good stuff and good taste. You know you do good work kid. I mean it, nice lighting, nice props, hen. Brass lamp, hair dryers, baseball bats, really phallic. Very classy. Jesus, what the hell's this? The kid with dog teeth, candle stuck in her mouth and up her pants? That's a little kinky isn't it? - Not for publication, private stock. - Hey! Let me have another look. It might be okay, I might be able to use it. - No! - That's the way you want it kid, okay. Okay listen, I want you to get me some more tasty stuff, some pretty girls huh, you understand? No fuckin' amputees, okay? Here's your check, I'll see you a little while. Okay? This stuff is great. Hey the dyke shots are good too. - Hey man how you doing? - How you doing? - Waiting for school to let out? - Those kids are my best customers. What do you need? - A spoon of smack, two grams of coke. - It's gonna cost 'ya. - Hey man I've got the bread. - Hey handsome, enjoy the show? Want some of the real thing. Hey we'll just walk along together. Listen, I teach French real cheap, huh? Give you a good deal on some half-and-half. - How much? - I don't talk price on the street, but look, there's a pad across the street. Room 214. We can talk inside. - What are you shooting, horse? Hey, I know a mainliner when I see one. - What's it to you, fucker? - Want to do some speed ball? - You shitting me honey? - Listen, like you wouldn't believe. If I like what I see, you get some, okay? - Let's go. - I'll be all right in a couple of minutes. - That's all right baby. - Something you can do for me. - Anything at all. - I want you to make a phone call. - Good morning, you're on-the-air with Dr. Lindsay Gale. - Hello Dr. Gale. Uh, my, my name's Denise, and I wanted to talk to you about my profession. See, I'm, I'm a, a, I'm a hoo... Prostitute, and I ain't happy with how I make my living, um, or my lack of education. See I have never, I've never done any other kind of work. My mother got me into this, um... - And you want to try something else now? Maybe train for some kind of career? - Yeah, yeah I'd like to do that. But, but see doc, I got another problem, uh, I'm, I'm kind of into drugs, you know, and... - Yes that doesn't help. You're high on something now aren't you Denise? - Yeah. Matter of fact I am. Um, one of my John's, he asked me to call you. He's sitting here with me right now. - Well that's a programming first I must say. - Yeah, he says he's a regular caller. Let, he's got headache problems. But that ain't his only problem, see, he can't... - Denise? Hello? Denise? Denise, are you there? Denise? My god! Are you there? - You hear that Dr. Gale? - Oh my god! - This is for your troubles. - Dr. Gale! You asked for me? - No, captain daley referred me to you. It's about the strangler. - Yeah, our man is good as caught. In a moment we'll have a complete profile courtesy of Dr. Gale. - Excuse me, I am not here to be the target of your half-assed sarcasm. Captain daley thinks I have something to contribute, are you interested or not? - Yes, uh, we're a little tired, so will you please sit down and continue? - Thank you. Today a prostitute named Denise called my radio show. I think she was the strangler's last victim. The call was taped, here's a copy. - Why was it taped? - All calls are in case of alleged libel or public misinformation, it's just station policy. - What makes you suspect foul play? - It's a terrifying tape. The call ends abruptly with Denise screaming her head off. There's a man's voice on that tape also. Now, I have another call that was taped with that same man's voice on it. The caller's name is ramone, and I really do think that he was with her today. He has a frightening background. On his first two calls he complains of severe headaches, brief blackouts and other symptoms of someone who has scar tissue on the brain. This could cause uncontrollable urges to kill. - Well doctor, are seizures like that easily triggered? - It wouldn't be unusual. Bright lights and flickering images, loud noises, sometimes seemingly nothing at all. - Great. We can run a voice print on those tapes, see if they match. - Okay hatch. Doctor, it, uh, might be a good idea if we kept close tabs on you. Let's, uh, put a stakeout at the clinic. - I appreciate that you care. But do keep in mind that some of those people that I help are not going to be coming around with police outside the door. - I'm aware of that Dr. Gale, we'll still have a squad car cruise the radio station and your house. - Well I'm flattered that you care. - Well that's what you pay your taxes for. - I'm all man. I killed and raped 'em all. And no one can stop me, 'cause I'm too strong, too smart, and too good. - Hatch, you're wearing a hole in the floor! Why don't you go home and chant? - Hey this case is making me nuts. I can't sleep at night, huh? - Well neither can I! All right I'm sorry, let's go through it again. - Okay- we know from the sperm cell type, blood type, position of the body, the whole m.O., that our strangler killed Denise, now that's for sure. Hmm? Okay, two, a new wrinkle. Heroin and cocaine were found on the premises. So I figure our strangler is a drug user. No works were found, but the autopsy report says that Denise was full of heroin and cocaine, so she had to shoot herself up with something right? Okay, so that means that our strangler took the hypo kit with him. Now, this is the thing that really bugs me man! Somebody else was there! We got three different blood types! - I know that hatch. - Yeah... Maybe it was her pimp! Darnell adkins! - Aww, that shit ass bag man for Bobby hammer? - Maybe, adkins tried to rob the strangler, and got busted up instead, huh? Now we've got enough snitches to put us onto adkins, 'cause with his habit he can't burrow too deep. - Maybe the works belong to adkins? It's more logical to me. - Yeah, maybe they had a Daisy chain and held a shooting party, how the hell do I know? All I know is, is that if we find the works, we either find the strangler or somebody that's seen him. - Well, let's go find Darnell adkins. - Hey fella, police department. Do you recognize this person? - No. - Here, here. - Hey hey, winky, what's happening? - Hey I hear you guys are looking for Darnell? - Yeah that's right. - Well? - Well what? - 50 bucks! - 50 bucks? - Come on winky, nobody's worth 50 bucks. - 20 bucks! 10 bucks? - What do you think hatch? - Well, the last time this guy gave us a tip, he told us that the Boston strangler was Tony Curtis. - You mean he wasn't? Well nobody's perfect! - Hey winky, now you give me the info, and I'll decide what it's worth. - Well he hangs outwith this chick named hotpants, and she works down at the hard times massage parlor. - That's Johnny ventura's place. - Oh, goody, a real den of vice. - Let's get out of here. - Aaah! Five? - That beats a blank, winky. Hi! - Oooh, hi! - Hello boys! This is a private health club and we do have a renewable initiation fee of $20. - That sounds fair. - Is there anything else we should know? - The only other charge is for the shower and the sauna. $30 a half hour, $50 an hour, and any agreement that you make between the girls is absolutely private and personal, and works on a gratuity basis. - Uh hmm, beautiful... Yeah I bet you have the ring in the trunk, hatch. - Oh I'm thinking about it. - Is hotpants around? - Yeah as a matter of fact I think she is available, hold on. Ricky, will you please go to room 127? Yeah. We also accept all major credit cards and we do take cash, and the shower is mandatory. - Relax, we're homicide. Vice is beneath us. - What's this about, I mean, you guy's got a warrant? - No we just want to ask a few questions, you got nothing to worry about. - Yeah, I kind of like the place. - Yeah I'm sure. - Now which way is 127? - Across the hall. - It's about time my man! It is about time, that is good shit! - Yeah I know that man. Yeah. Now where's my damn money, so I can get out of here? - You got it, hold on. - It's a bust! - What? Shit! Shit! If they pin this one on me, I'll be in the slammer forever! - Hey where you going with that stuff? - I am gonna flush this! - Hey man are you crazy that's good shit, what you doing? Shit! - The cops probably followed you up here! You dumb nigger you! - Hey who the fuck you calling dumb, asshole breath? Why in hell she call the cops? The girl's just coked up anyway, and can't flush a fucking toilet, and who's she call, the cops! Here! - Recognize this man? - No. - You sure you haven't seen him before? - No I haven't. - Well this is Darnell adkins... - It won't flush! - What the fuck, once it hits that water it's no good to snort anymore! - How long you been working here rikki? - About six months. - You like your job? - No. - Well it looks like you lost five bucks McCabe. Another dead end. - I am leaving, babe! - Hey, do you want to live to be able to fuck again? - Eh? - C-o-o-o-o-ps! - Oh my god it's a bust! - Bye, bye! - I want my 20 bucks back! - Give me back my underwear! - The key, god dammit, gimmee the key! - Let go of my change! - My husband will kill me! - Get off of me you sucka! - Don't stop now! - That rikki's a nice kid. - Yeah. - It's a bust! - Do you have an extra ring? I didn't know vice was called in? - Oooo, neither did I. - Why all those rumors get started? - Nah, I don't know, shall we look in the back? - Well there's no one to stop us. - Mm hmm. - Let's go. " Hi!" How you doing, huh? Everything okay, huh? - Oh, hi! Whoo! - Halt, police! Freeze! Ah, we know who this is. - Adkins. God dammit! - He was our only lead. - Shit! - And it's all over this shit. Now we got to stay up all night and make out police forms. - What do you mean we? I missed. - Well dad, are you proud of me now? Do I measure up? Huh? Did you see how I took care of that nigger? That nigger drew a knife on me. That mother fucker drew a knife on me! He thought he could kill this white mother fucking honky! But you made a big fucking mistake! 'Cause I broke your mother fucking head, pimp! You thought you was cute with all your white girls from Hollywood boulevard and Van nuys boulevard, didn't you mother fucker? You thought you could beat the shit out of this white mother fucker? Big mistake. No, fuck you! See what I did to him dad? 'Cause I'm the best there is. - Yeah, McCabe here. Who? Sure I know her. Where is she? All right I'll be there in 10 minutes. Shit! - Lisa! Don't do this to yourself. I know we can work things out. - I don't care. I don't care about any of it. - You've got your whole life ahead of you! - All right sargent, how are things going? - Yeah not too bad lieutenant, we got the street blocked off, we've been here about an hour. - How long has Dr. Gale been here? - Black and white unit brought her up about 15 minutes ago. - She doing any good? - No, why don't you give it a try. - I sure will. Excuse me Dr. Gale, this is a police matter. - Fine lieutenant. - Hey Lisa. - Hey Chris. - What kind of stunt is this? - My last one. - What's the matter honey? - Everything, that's all. - Come on in and we'll talk it over. - No. - The lights bother you? It doesn't matter. - Want me to call your old man? - Don't bother, I already called him. Told him what I was gonna do and, he just laughed. He said go ahead and do it. - What do you want, attention? Now come on, forget it, you'll be a four-line blurb on page 20. - I get the picture. No one gives a shit. - I'm here. You know it's the first night I've had off in two weeks. Now come on we all have our losing streaks, give it a shot. - Go to hell. - You know something? That fall's not gonna hurt you one bit. It's just the sudden stop. Besides, it's against the law to commit suicide. Now get your ass in here before you catch a cold. ~ oh! - Come on! - Oh Lisa! Listen, I want you to go to the hospital in the ambulance. And I'll stop by tomorrow to see you, and we're gonna have a talk tomorrow after you feel better. I think maybe you need a little bit more help than I can give you. - I'll talk to you later. Sargent would you take over? - Good work lieutenant. - Thanks. - I'm real proud of you Lisa. Oh! - Well, how about a drink, doc? - You know you were great? I'd like to join you for a drink. Right now I think I need a good drink, more than I need good company, let's go. - Come on. - Why are you out all night chasing killers, why aren't you staying home doing something decent like raising a family? - Well cops and killers, don't keep regular hours. Besides now, my wife ran off with a guy that she could find at night. - The department must mean a lot to you. - Putting away the guy that mutilated your friend Carol means a hell of a lot to me. - You're okay McCabe. - You mean for a cop? - I mean for anybody. - Hey... You're Dr. Lindsay Gale, ain't 'ya? You look just like your picture in people magazine. I got this brother-in-law, see, and he's staying with me and the wife this one time, and I come home, I come home from work, the wife's out you know, and he's wearing the little lady's girdle. Which he don't look so bad in, but I don't know what... - hey pal. L.A.P.D. Homicide. Do you hang around with your brother-in-law? You been seen with him lately? - No, no... - You sure about that? - Hold on, I think he moved to Minneapolis years ago. We never hear from him anymore. Never see him. - Okay, thanks, the next round's on me. - I'll hold 'ya to that. - You know you weren't real nice to me when we first met? - I was only doing my job. - So was I. - No kidding. - I think it maybe all has to do with loneliness. - Are you lonely? - Yes, aren't you? - Not now. (My m)'- - you're an easy man to be intimate with McCabe. - You tell all the guys that. Now don't be so serious. - I am serious. - Come here. - Oh, oh... Oh so good! 30 good! - I don't now which side of the street they live on. - The house with the green door. - The green door? - The green door. - Thank you ma'am. - Glad I could be of service. - Just a minute! Hello! - Hello, I'm kirk Smith. I'm here for the photo session. - What session? - I was sent over by loyd Weston to do your portfolio. - But I just had my composite shot.
