They keep telling me about the dead people that he turns into pigs. Really? Well that's not so strange. What isn't strange? The story about people being turned into pigs. It was claimed that people would turn into pigs. Then into gods and goddesses. The ancient Egyptians believed that you know? Yeah. That's right. They didn't eat pigs because they worshiped them. Well I tell you something. There's no gods and goddesses around here and the Macy sisters aren't Egyptian. Yeah. Yeah well, you're right about that. Lynn is there anything that you can tell me about Ben Sharp? What? Did you hear anything? Any kind of uh strange noises? Pigs? Pigs always make noises. Oh I know, I know.
