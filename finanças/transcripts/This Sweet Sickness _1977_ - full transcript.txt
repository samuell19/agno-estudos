TELL HER THAT I LOVE HER From the novel "This Sweet Sickness" by Patricia Highsmith Our kite is called Fergus. Yes, it's true. Did you want something, Madam? I wanted to go in but your stupid concierge wouldn't let me. - You didn't wake him up? - Yes, a little bit. What's going on, Martinaud? Mardi Gras? No, it's nothing, Mr. Chouin. A festival at 1 am? Tell your friend he lacks upbringing. He called me an old turd just now. You misunderstood. It was perfectly clear and distinct. You're rude, sir... I don't know your name or I'd given you an earful. Go back in, you'll catch cold. Sure, I'm going but be more careful about your friends, David. I made some kidneys and left them in front of your door. - They just need to be reheated. - Thank you. - Not at all. Good night, David. - Good night, Mr. Chouin. Can you drive me home? - At this hour? - Well, yes. - Good evening. - Good evening. Who's that girl? She looks familiar. She works at the office next door. She's a real dish. You didn't tell me you had neighbors like that. Is she single? She's only been here for two weeks. I'll take you home but I'm not coming in. But you have to come in! Nicole is waiting for me with a kitchen knife! That big sharp one! - Hello. - Hello. Thank you. Goodbye, Madam. - Reval-France. - Let me see. File these under last year. Sandy okayed it. We gain three months. A call from Marsat, Mr. Martinaud. I'll take it. - Hello? - Hello, is that you, Martinaud? Yes. Hello? - It's Dutilleux. - I don't know you. What you mean, you don't know me? Dutilleux, Lise's husband. Listen, you're pissing us off with your letters, understand? Get this place cleaned up! I'll go outside. There's nothing. - The postman already came? - Yes, but there's no mail. But come see, I have something for you. I'm running late. Come on, your parents have plenty of time. And they'll really like this. You told me the other day they were crazy about paella. Look at this! Isn't it lovely? Juliette helped me. Splendid. Thank you. Not at all. Last Friday I made Mussels Marinière but he said his mother didn't like mussels. Right, David? So I didn't put mussels in this. It won't be easy to carry. It'll never fit in my bag. Put it on the floor in your car. I'll wrap it up. What is she doing? Wait! Here you are! You can go now. A treat for your parents. Better than the crap they serve in hospitals. Rest home, Mr. Chouin. Sure, but it's the same slop. And this is real Valencian paella. Wait. I'll help you. Here you are. - How are you, Raymond? - Fine, Mr. Fergus. I cleared the snow from your driveway. - I'll pay you tomorrow. - There's no hurry. - Thanks. - Not at all. Bye, Mr. Fergus. Bye, Raymond. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2... We weren't doing anything bad, sir. Yes, you were. Get out of here! This is private property. No one enters! No one! - Hello. - Hello. Excuse me. Would you be free tonight? Why, would you like to take me out? No, but your pal, François has invited me to dinner and then to a club. That sounds very nice. No, it annoys me. He calls me, he's married, he really bugs me, your pal. I've got a lot of work to do, you know? Excuse me. Let her tell me my breath stinks! Slow dancing is for body contact... with a handsome guy like me. You aren't dancing? Last time my glasses fell off and someone stomped on them. Check out François. He's not exactly world-class. Did you like that old movie the other night at the ABC? I've seen you there twice. It wasn't bad... a bit old-fashioned. Old-fashioned? You mean silly? She must be pretty, your girlfriend. You spend every weekend with her. I take care of my parents on the weekends. Your parents have been dead for a long time. I saw it in your file at the office. It's part of my job, you know. It's a mistake. You got mixed up. Anyway, I have a feeling it's a married woman on the weekends. Am I wrong? It happens a lot in provinces. You must be mistaken about that file. No, it was yours. I take care of my parents. They are old and sick and in a rest home. I spend every Sunday with them, and that's where all my money goes. Don't get upset. Maybe it was a mistake. I'm not upset. I'm just setting the matter straight. Thank you. Good night. Good night. You aren't too mad at me? It's no big deal. Sometimes I get out of line. People always say I'm too direct. What I'm trying to say is... that I'd be really happy if you weren't so shy with me. I'm shy enough as it is. Good night. "Dear David, "I haven't written since my return to Marsat - please, forgive me. "But I think I have a valid excuse... "I just had a baby, a boy... They say he looks a lot like me. "This made me terribly happy... at least, for the moment. "And though sometimes I think I could have been as happy with you, or even happier, my life took a different turn." "You must stop dreaming about us." You aren't a bit queer by any chance? Oh, "queer" isn't used anymore? Really, I don't know what you are waiting for with Juliette... "Never say no, never say no, never, never say no to me..." "Just say yes." I bet this Juliette is great in bed. I even think both of us could screw her, don't you agree? What's wrong? What? You're getting to be a drag, David... Hey, it hurts! This guy is completely crazy! Go back to your little wife! Go back to your shit hole! - What is it? - It's me, David Martinaud. Just a second. I love Lise. I've always loved her. And I intend to marry her. - Listen, old man... - Don't "old man" me! Now you're giving lessons in manners? In a way, I'm glad you came. I'm even delighted. I don't like your letters, Martinaud. I don't want to receive them anymore. - I'm writing to Lise! - Lise is my wife. You have no right to read my letters! Let me in. I want to see Lise. It's out of the question. She's very tired. You'd better scram. You're exactly what I thought - a maniac. You're completely cracked. Is she your prisoner or what? Lise, tell him to let me in! For God's sake! You'll wake up the whole neighborhood! I want you to understand... - Get lost. - No. Lise and I have known each other far longer than you. So much happened between Lise and me... Why am I listening to this crap? Wait, don't go, listen to me! Do you even know how to take care of a woman like that? Lise! I want to see Lise! "I had so many things to tell you but there was no way. "The revelation of your husband surprised me, even struck me. "This marriage must be undone. "Be reasonable, try to see things my way. Like no one else can see them." PRIVATE PROPERTY. NO TRESSPASSING. It'll be good in a minute. Anybody home? - What name, sir? - Fergus. Here you are, sir. The chalet. The living room. The fireplace. The piano. Our room. Lise! Did I scare you? No, but I wasn't expecting you. It's been so long... I want to spend the rest of my life with you. You're completely crazy. I don't know... - Are you feeling better? - I'm just fine. Is that your car? Yes, I thought about buying a convertible... I don't know... I'd like... Do you want to come in for a second? It's hard to talk here. I'd prefer if we walked a little. You don't use the same perfume? No more "Je reviens"? No, it's new. I've brought the photos of the house. What house? Yes, don't you want to see them? It's the house for you. You'll come to see it soon? When? Are you alone here in Boissy? I mean, you aren't with someone? Don't stay alone too long. It's not good. Now you're making fun of me. You know I only want you. The problem is I have a husband and a baby. It wouldn't have been so hard to wait two years for me. I wasn't sure. Why? I wasn't sure. In those days you never said anything. But you aren't in love with him? It's never easy at first. - But you aren't in love with him? - We haven't been married very long. I'll get you out of it. - Here's my bus. - No. I'll take you home. No, no. But you must tell him you saw me! Don't be afraid. "Why not love me... for you were happiness itself? "You must think of all the love I dream for you. "Why not love me... "I'm dying for your love." Come on, a song, Mr. Chouin... I will recite an ode. Why not? An ode. "Let's drink a glass... let's drink a pair! "Let's drink to lovers everywhere. "To all those under under Cupid's spell "I bless their union, I wish them well." He's a real poet... Attention! The solemn moment has arrived. Happy New Year! Happy New Year! - Happy New Year! - Happy New Year, David! Happy New Year, Mr. Chouin! For me? That is so nice. This is for you. You shouldn't have... "The French Culinary Art" by our great masters of cuisine. FERGUS, KING OF SCOTLAND What do you want? Not very nice to walk out on François. François doesn't care. Well, it's not nice to me. May I come in? I won't stay long. Excuse me, but this is really intolerable. You spy on me. You follow me everywhere. I can't stand it! What's in this girl that makes you like this? What? Makes me like what? So... so unhappy, so pathetic. I'm not unhappy. I'm thirsty. You've got anything to drink? Beer. I'd like some. I'd like to sleep here tonight. The girl who's never here doesn't bother me. Don't feel like it? Yes, I do. The bed is too small. It doesn't matter. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Why are you staring at me like that? Don't look at me like that. I'm not staring at you. You women, you think you know everything! With your narrow little minds and your tongues are always wagging! "Shall we take a little walk, David? Let's go to the movies... "Take my hand... Say something sweet to me..." And all that time, you're almost coming in your pants! A call from Marsat, Mr. Martinaud. - Hello? - Hello! Yes, hello! Listen, Lise told me she saw you the other day. Are you following her now? You accost her on the street? It's no good. I'll tell you something, Martinaud... Disappear! It's in your own interests! Hello? - Hello? - Give me Lise, I want to talk to her. I've just explained, don't you get it? Is that you, my Lise? I'm coming back to Marsat, this time to take you away. I should've done it the first time. - It's not possible. - Yes, it is, you'll see, Lise. The baby is no problem, we'll have our own. After the divorce, you can make a present of this one to Dutilleux. Are you done, Martinaud? Listen you, Mr. Kitchen Appliances... Listen carefully... I've furnished a home for two... Just for Lise and myself... Nothing like your dump. I won't tell you where it is so you can't come and soil her with your greasy paws. - Shit! - Shut up! Shut up! I'm sick of your shit! You meddle in everything! I can't stand your cretinous voice! I feel good, understand? I'm 27 and in perfect shape. And soon Lise will be in my house. Do you like hearing that? She'll hang her dresses in my closet, she'll eat off my plates... And I'll take her in my arms. Martinaud? Martinaud? Are you there? Anybody home? Don't be a jerk, Martinaud. I know you're in there. Are you afraid to open up? Get lost! I'm not leaving until we've talked. Listen, Martinaud, it's cold... We could... Don't be a jerk. Hey, that's enough! - I just brought it along for protection... - Get lost! Can't you see it's locked? I have the key in my pocket. Come and get it! Listen, Martinaud. I've come to say I'm sick and tired of you. Understand? And Lise is even more than me! I didn't understand a word. What did you say? I said I've had it up to here with your letters, with your threats... So I'm here. Explain it to me. I can't seem to follow it. What do you want exactly? Look at you! Are you hurt? Nothing's broken, eh? Don't touch me, damn it! You touch Lise, I touch you. Look, Martinaud... I touch you. It bothers you, right? Now it's me who fucks Lise! Hands up, you little piece of shit! That's what happens... Go! Go! Ignition! Starter, go! What is it now? It's the fucking parking brake... Wait! Now get out of here! For good! - Did your friend find you? - Who? "I want ot see Martinaud! I know he lives here!" He was obviously drunk, that guy... Luckily, Juliette was here. She told him where I was? I don't know. I didn't hear. She walked him to his car. You and Juliette have little secrets you don't share with me now. I'm not trusted anymore. And a lady called from Marsat. I said you'd gone to your parents. "I absolutely must speak to you." - Juliette There's a Juliette on the phone for you. I'm not here. Hello. Yes, David. I just saw in the paper. It seems he came to Boissy yesterday, he was in a rage. He wanted to kill me or what? - And how are you? - I'm alive, I guess... I don't know. Hang in there, Lise. Chin up. Do you want me to come by? Do you want me to come by? Hello? I was talking to Lise. Leave her alone. She doesn't want to talk to anyone. Tell her it's David. Hello? Mr. Martinaud? It's that Juliette again. I'm not here! You won't kiss me? Someone's coming. - Who? - A neighbor, she won't be late. You're always waiting for someone. Take off your coat. It's nice in here. Come in. Sit down. Would you like a drink? No, no. I could make some tea. No, don't bother. So how are you, Lise? Fine. You're going to come with me now. Do you think it's too abrupt? Why won't you sit down? I never get any time with you. You're always expecting someone. Do you need a little time to think? Is that it? We'll bring the little girl with us. It's not a problem. It's a boy. Right. In the meantime, do you want to stay here? I'll look for work... I don't know. I could give piano lessons. I earn a good living, I've told you. What's all this money for me alone? Where is this house of yours, in Savoie? I saw no one that Sunday. My house is in the opposite direction. Where? The other way. No one knows about my house. I said I was visiting my parents. - They are dead. - I lied to have peace. The house was only for us. If he had an accident, it wasn't my fault. You talk like a policeman or an insurance agent. No one is to blame for an accident. - You must leave now. - I'll wait outside if you'd like. And then I'll come back. Do you think I'm going to put you up for the night? What's going on, Lise? It's Madam Barbet, do you recall? You went to school with her son. - Hello, Madam. - It's David Martinaud. He's leaving. But we haven't finished talking. I don't see what could possibly be left to say. Is the show for her? What's gotten into you? Let go. Leave her alone. Are you finished? You pig! You know what you are? - What do you want? - I'm not afraid of you. Go, you asshole! She's as stupid as a donkey. When will we see each other? I'm going away to Sanary. I'm going to my parents' house to rest. I need it, you know. Are you going to stay long? A month... maybe... A month? And then? I don't really know, David. I'll be thinking of you... I've just come back from seeing Lise. Really? She's gone to Sanary. She just left my office. She came to see me. - I'll call her. - I just left her. She won't be home yet. She wanted to know why I sent her husband down there. I told her that I sent him away, anywhere, because he was drunk, to get rid of him. Did I do well? - I told her I was in love with you... - And then? Then? What did you say afterwards? Then I told her I was in love with you... because it's true. Then we talked a lot about you. You'll never have her, David. That's for sure. She thinks you're to blame for her husband... He had an accident... It's not just that. What? You disgust her. You disgust her physically. She can't stand you, you scare her. When I told her I was in love with you, she laughed at me. She had a good laugh. Excuse me, I'm feeling sick. Stay here. She knows you live in that chalet, now she wants proof. Of course, if you dropped a few hints... like you gave her husband. I'm going to throw up, let me go. I don't care what you tell her, I'm above all that... And Lise too, she knows you don't want to believe me. Sorry. May I use the phone? We say "good evening" when we enter someone's home. Good evening. May I call now? Hold this for a second. Stir gently in a figure 8. Good evening. I don't want your phone calls anymore. No matter who spits in the receiver, it's always Chouin who gets the germs! Yes, but I must use the phone. The little lady from Marsat came to see me. She told me the whole story. You're the one who caused this scandal? Your poor parents, the rest home, the visits... ...all that crap. You told us a pack of lies, David. You're a big disappointment to me, Martinaud. What's that? What's this ruckus? What are you talking about? You are, I'm telling you, real shit, my man. Shit! Did I hurt you? Leave me alone! Wait! But it's nothing... Bastard! Bastard! You shouldn't get yourself in such a state. - It's nothing, Mr. Chouin, let me see... - Shut up! Shut up! You bitch. You tease, you slut. - Easy, Mr. Chouin, easy. - You shut up too! You filthy, disgusting liar, seducer of widows! Everybody wants to screw everybody. You turned my house... into a bordello. That's it! I swear! I'll tell the landlord and he'll throw you out! He says not to bother to come in. She is really tough, really tough. Have a seat. And thank you. I have to make another call. - Stay here, what's the hurry? - I have to make that call. Who are you calling, the Merry Widow? You know that song, "The Merry Widow"? "Merry Widow, on my pillow, just the two us... "How she sighs, when I caress her thighs..." You're flipping out, you can't take it anymore. Are you going to get it on with that girl or what? Go fuck a duck. David, are you going to screw that chick or not? - Hello? - Lise? It's David. So you didn't leave? - No. - I wrote to you at Sanary. Excuse me, I'm out of breath, I was outside. I see. You came to Boissy and you didn't even visit me? Sorry, I can't talk now. Is someone there with you? - Yes. - Who is it? If you want we can get together on Saturday. Saturday? Wonderful! At noon or earlier? Noon is fine. I have to go, the baby's crying. See you on Saturday. Kisses. Kisses. See you on Saturday. So when is the wedding? Pretty soon. I'm going to need a best man... - Have a good day. - Thank you. Bye! Mommy's going out. Thanks. Here - I didn't want to do it in front of that girl. What is it? OK. What's your favorite restaurant? Take me... you know where. We could get there in 2 hours. We'll go to see the chalet now - it's a little further up. It's locked. There's another entrance round back. It would be easy to force it. I can't see anything. Wait. It's nice. Don't you think? It's very nice. Let's see. It's out of tune. One should never leave a piano open. You shouldn't touch anything. You're smoking now? Sometimes. Won't you take them off? You're right. Will you help me? Come. Did you see - there's upstairs? You're messing up my hair. Will you marry me? You can't say my question is unexpected. No. There's no problem... I can come to Marsat every night if you want. When would you like? Monday? Tuesday? Look, tomorrow is Sunday. You know, from now on you must forget about me. Completely. Do you understand? Am I being clear enough? - What's come over you? - Nothing. Don't write to me, don't call me anymore - that's all. Maybe I'll remarry someday. But one thing is certain - I'll never marry you. Maybe I'm wrong, but that's how it is. Who is it? A neighbor, Michel Bardet. You know him. Is he that woman's son? Yes. What does he do? What does it matter? We see each other often. That's all. This door will need fixing. ONE MONTH LATER - Good evening. David. - Good evening. You're already home? I didn't go to work today. Well? I didn't feel like it. Don't forget we're invited to François and Nicole's tonight. Shouldn't you bring her a book? Thank you. Goodbye, Madam. You could've told me, it's all cold now. I had to work late. Anyway, I'm not hungry. Why are you looking at that? Does it shock you? For the people who do graffiti... it's meaningful. It's like messages. Messages of what? Of love. I prefer to send flowers as a message of love. Like this rose? Look at this disgusting rose. It's still a rose. Sure it's a rose. It's a tuft with a hole in the middle. Drop it. We've all got one between our legs. It doesn't interest me. I wonder if you've ever really been laid, if you've ever really fucked, stuck it up in the ass... - I'm not interested. - Really? I'm not interested in caca and snot. You're lying! She shits too, your Lise! She shits, she wipes her ass! I just don't know how to be with you. It's not you. It's not your fault. - Shall we go for a drink? - OK. Where? I came to get you. But I want a few words with this guy first. Do you recognize me? Martinaud. If you don't leave us alone. we're calling the cops, I'm warning you. Did you have a good time? It's your last time with Lise - did you enjoy it? What a jerk! Get lost. Scram. Hey! You'd better listen to me... It's unbelievable - everyone's telling me to get lost! Listen carefully: soon Lise will be my wife, and I don't like her going out with some random guys. Should I call the cops? Calm down! OK, that's enough. Let's go. Pick up your things. Can't you understand that she doesn't want to see you? He's completely crazy! I'm calling the cops. You're a real pain! It's so simple - I just want you to come with me. Hey you, leave these people alone! Now I'm going to call the cops. Go ahead, call them! I'd be very happy to get rid of these two. Haven't you upset them enough? My whole life has been upset and so was hers. I know what to do with my life! I do! I'm sick of you! I'm sick, sick of this guy! Leave her alone! Get out of here, I don't want to see you! Hey, you two over there - life really sucks. - Stop, it's out of tune. - Sure is. Like everything. I told you to stop! Well, that's it. OK, I'll put on a record. You're hitting the bottle now? That's new. Do you have anything besides classical? Something more upbeat? OK, that will do. That's right, make yourself useful. That will do! Shall we dance? That's enough, damn it! Listen to you... Why watch it if it doesn't interest you? I'm going to make some coffee. - That black girl is hot. - Shut up. You can't stand us anymore? You think you're better than him? You think you respect women? You're the worst of all. Asshole, you've hurt me, look at this. I'm sorry. No, you're not. You're never sorry. You live in your dream world. You don't know the people around you, you don't even see them. It's not true. Are we having fun yet? Why don't you leave? This place has turned shitty since you came! Lise is the one who should be here. I did all this for her... ...not for you! He's completely gone... You're crazy! Wherever and whenever you want. If you think you can scare me... I'm getting out of here. Great! And take her with you. I don't take orders from you, Martinaud. Only idiots never change their mind. I'm just fine here. Would it bother you if I stay? No! Oh Lise, what a mess. Juliette. I'm Juliette. Are you ready? Lise? - Have you seen Lise? - No, I thought she was with you. No. I'll wait downstairs. Lise! Come on. To the pool and fast! Lise! TELL HER THAT I LOVE HER
