[Film projector sound FX] [VO] Nothing greater than being chosen. One day you'll understand. [Ghostly music - whispery] [Car revs] [Crying] This is what kind of god you are? This is what kind of god I've put my trust into? Trust. I'll show you trust. I'm rejecting you, the same way you rejected me! [Crying] Do you goennounce your god? You pledge to me I'll make you strong. And get them back for treating you so badly. Yes. Paster Frank, Why did you call us here? Is everything OK? At ease gentlemen at ease! Everything's just fine. I thought Jack and I were being called to be told off or something. Me to. No nothing like that at all. I just thought you gentlemen would like to know that... I spoke with Reeno today. You talked to him? When? Right before you came in here. I also thought you'd like to know that, Reeno's back. [Dark bass music] So Reeno's back. Well I'll be damned. Reeno's back. The days of him running from who he is, are over. My uncle Rick, he raised me, he had the gift. Demon's are no serial killers. Find a new container, shit head. [Gun shot] We call them containers. [Mumbles] He died of old age. [Engine revs] [Monster, growling sounds] [Growls] We'll never leave. You have no power over me. Maggots! [Growls] [Growling continues] Well what do we do know? I know a man, he's not a Catholic but, we use him when things get out of hand. I don't get it, is he an infidel. No. He's a man of God. He's just a different type. [Car skidding] We must never, ever lose faith. Where's the girl? She's in the room down the hall. It's the worst case I've seen in years. Tell Mas everything will be alright. Who was that man? He's... he's God's gun. [Growling] Can you hear me? I know that's you in there. I served the most thy God and I'm here to help you. [Grows - mumbles] Luthien, is that you? I thought I saw the last of your sorry ass when I cast you out of that philippino ten years ago. Fuck you. That's no way to greet an old friend. That's OK you'll be screaming in a few seconds. Do you want to be free? [Growls] The choice is yours. Help. Help me. I see you learnt some new tricks Luthien. Almost a pitty to watch you get beat down. Again. Screw you Reeno. You know what people age. You know that God hates you. You got yourself a judge man. I know about your... New house in Mexico. That was Columbia jack ass. You want me in Mexico. You're the one to blames for your wife leaving you. We can do this the easy way. Or if you like, I would gladly use his name. You you're God is so strong, why do they need your gun? I didn't need a gun 10 years ago, in Saboo. Until you're screaming like a little bitch, I'll use the name Jesus on you. [Screaming] What's the matter Luthien? It burns, stop it you moron. Enough is enough. Come out in the name if Jesus. [disturbing roaring and growling] Thank you. Thank you sir. You don't have to thank me. Thank the one that died. Doing their roles again. [Kids screaming/ playing] My god it's Saton. It's what? It's the Devil. It's Saton put here on Earth to remind us he's still around. Aren't you being a little over dramatic? It's disgusting. It's a Jerusalem beetle. Just finish it, I need you, You'll be there, right? Of course, another weekend chasing a myth. She's an urban legend, it's a good project. It's cool I'll be there it'll be fine. Thanks, I knew I could count on you. Unlike Joey. Is he still going? He's a jerk, I can't reach him. - Some boyfriend. - Money said he'll go with is. Maybe I'll call Reeno, he'll go with us too. Is that the guy that knew your brother? The one that's a bad ass? Yeah! He's definitely a bad ass. What are you thinking about? I think you need to go. What? What's your problem? My girlfriend's blowing up my phone, so you gotta get out of here. Ass hole. Uncle rick. How did you do it? You kept things together. [Voice echos] It's what we do Reeno. All I wanted was to be normal. To walk away. The God won't let me go. Free will. Is it really? Demon hunting is like breathing. I knew I'd find you here. Why was he buried so far out of the way? Aunt Jane and uncle Rick, this is where they had their first kiss. Speaking of women, were you with that girl you were telling me about? Tanya... yeah. She's the one Sam. Why do you keep saying that? How do you know? The same way I knew that Catherine was the woman for me. I know what you're thinking Sam. No you don't. Look, two people may be right for one another but we can still screw things up. Free will, right? Free will. Joey's my friend, she's untouchable. You're a standup guy, you're like your brother. Anyway you'll ring your mojo if it wasn't for Tanya. No I do. Joey's a prick, but he's still my friend. What am I supposed to do, what would you do? Wait? Their relationship's over, they just don't know it yet. I'm not a home wrecker. No no, you're not, and you're not doing the wrecking. God is. Hey we're going out of town to do a story on some urban legend can you roll with us? You can meet my friends. I wish I could but... I have to meet up with Jack tomorrow. Another case? I don't know but... Something's up. Self control Reeno. You're a demon hunter. Not a civilian, no need to give the Devil and opportunity. [Whispery ghostly voice] [Monstrous sounds] [Plucky music] [Speaks French] You speak English? A little. I'm looking for the one they call (speaks a foreign name) Ay... Are you working for (says foreign name)? Yes. Where is he? Come with me Bobbie. He will be here shortly. [Monstrous sound] What's the matter baby I'm not your type? No you are absolutely hot but...I love my wife. It's all fine baby. My wife won't think so. [Monstrous voice] You dumb mother fucker! [Rants on monstrous voice] So you're the one they call (speaks foreign name)? [Speaks foreign with monstrous sound] Why don't you come at me with a real gun? You haven't been shot with this gone yet. I use this gun because God told me to. Don't you have a copy? [Loud gun shot with splatter and growl] [Gun shot again] Alright, what's wrong, you're not eating or sleeping. It's Reeno. Seperating is never easy. Yeah. Did you file the papers yet? No. Not yet. I just don't know I... God he drives me crazy sometimes you know and... I can't stand living with him but... But you can't live without him? So did you talk to Tanya? Yeah. It's cool Sam. It is? Yeah she's gonna meet us out there tomorrow. Well why don't we all go out there tomorrow? Yeah why take two cars? She's got some stupid shit, some last minute crap, typical shit I swear. Alright Jack what's going on? That hark, he has another case from... I knew it. Sorry bro. This aint no social call. I sensed it. It's bad isn't it? It is. The Maria Cruise case. Maria Cruise? She's a myth. No. She is definitely real. She is pissed, and the body count is rising. Sounds like bogatile, all over again. Let's put it this way Reeno, the shit may hit the fan. And when it does, you know what to do. I'll be ready! That's the photo of her inside. Place is out in the middle of nowhere. And it's in there. Are you sure? It's been confirmed. I'll leave first thing in the morning. Have a good day. [Tense music] [Screaming] Please. No one has to know. [Laughs] [Monstrous voice] No one has to know what? That you're out here, that you're real. [Laughs] No one needs to know. Oh Love, you're right. No one needs to know. So gorgeous. Don't you think? Please. Oh...sweet little girl, we're only going to beat you to death. No cuddling afterwards. That shit is over rated. No, no! [Yelping] [Smack - SCREAMS] [Heavy beating sounds] What's up bro? Did you talk to Jeff Yeah, I did, they gave me the Maria Cruise case. Shit, the Maria Cruise Case? Yeah. Isn't that that chick that sold her soul to the Devil? Yeah. It's pretty serious this one Steve. Aren't they all. Mexico. Columbia. China. Even Africa. Let's face it Reeno, you're God's gun. And besides, we had to terminate containers in the past. Yeah, I'd rather the person be free. Freedom. You going soft on me bro? You know better than that. I don't know if this is a good time. But I need to talk to you about something. What is it? It's Catherine your ex. She came by earlier. What did she say now? Is she still working with that Bishop brettmore? I don't know about all of that. The due is trying to steal my lady Steve. Look all I know, she want's to talk to you, she want's to see you. Alright. Joey where are you guys? I've been waiting here for over two hours. Just hurry up! Idiot I swear! [Dark music] Maria Cruise, what a crock! [Whispery music] [Screams] [Slapping and beating sounds] [Screaming] OK here's her car. Where is she? I don't know Stan she said she's here so, gotta be here somewhere. Here were you guys gone? I'm gonna take a piss. Man what you doing? I'm taking a piss. [general muttering and banter] [Creepy music] Hurry up we gotta fund Tanya. You got control of that thing? Hello guys? What's going on? I'm Tina. Reeno I still love you. You what? I said I still love you. Just that the things you do are crazy. Even if it's in God's name it's still crazy! Who have you been talking now? Bishop Brett told me you killed someone in South America. Bishop? What a doosh bag. Reeno! Look guys went down but I didn't kill them, they were already dead. It's still wrong. It's God that chose them not us. If you stay just this once, I'll come home to you. You can come home. I have to do something first. Another case, I know I heard. My friends really do talk too much. Things can be good between us again. We definitely had something good between us but... But what? I have a job to do. Look Catherine, I do love you, you're gonna have to follow me, you're gonna have to trust me. We can't be devided. [Music] The past comes back, I remember you Catherine, I can't forget the day that we say goodbye. Catherine, no I think that I can understand, Catherine, I can never ever be your man. I can erase the memories that come into my mind, I really would like to see you and hope that you're doing fine. The things I want to say I can't put into words, but I can change a thing no matter how it hurts, the past comes back I remember you Catherine, I can't forget the day that we said goodbye Catherine. Now I think, that I can understand, Catherine. I could never ever be your man. I could never hold your hand again. Maybe down the line, we could meet again, now I realise I'd rather be your friend, but it's OK, it's alright, now I understand. [lyrics fade, Catherine's voice over speaks] Just the things that you do are crazy. Even if its in God's name it's still crazy. [Music lyrics come in] The things I want to say, I can't put into words. But I can change a thing no matter how it hurts. The past comes back, I remember you Catherine. I can't forget the day that we said goodbye, Catherine. Now I think that I can understand, Catherine, I could never ever be your man. The past comes back, I remember you Catherine, Oh I can't forget the day that we said goodbye, Catherine. Now I think, I can understand, Catherine, I could never ever be your man, Catherine. The past comes back, I remember you Catherine. Oh yeah. I just can't forget the day we said goodbye, Catherine. Now I think I can understand, Catherine, I could never ever be your man. Oh Catherine, ohhhhh yeah.... Catherine. It's starting to get dark. You guys can crash here tonight, we'll look for your friend in the morning. I'm sure she's fine, probably just fucking with us, trying to scare us. [Echo - voice] There is one that got away. It was a bad one, when the time comes, you'll know. Someone must die tonight. They all must die. Just like he did. Let him sleep it out. I'm worried about Tanya Joey. I'm not, she's just jerking us around man. I don't know, we should go look for her. Have fun with that. She might be in trouble, something might have happened to her. Like I said, have fun with that. I'm gonna stay right here. Hey guys. I made you some tea, it will help calm your nerves. Oh, it's bitter but kinda soothing. Oh yeah it's pretty good. [Laughter] [Evil laughs] Wake. My child. [Monstrous sound] Hi who are you? I'm Tina's friend, she said I'd like you Lennie. Lennie, why would you do that to me? You like me don't you? Of course I like you, I really really like you. That why would you do that? Why pee on me? [Monstrous voice] Why did you piss on my leg? [Guts being crushed] [Screams in pain] [Laughter] It's not crazy! It's necessary. Hi it's Catherine. We need to talk. Glad you stopped by Catherine. What's so urgent? Where have you been anyway? I've been doing a lot of thinking. I know things must be difficult with the divorce and everything. I'm not getting a divorce. Why not? Didn't Reeno sign the divorce papers? No I never asked him to. What the hell has gotten into you? I'm resigning Brett. Just where are you going? Look I love Reeno. I always have. I'm gonna follow him. I can always trust him. Trust him? You sure about that? What do you mean by that? I mean Reeno Penn is a fucking murderer. Just as AI thought. You hate Reeno for no cause. Who's a real murderer? Bitch. [Struggle] I'll come back for you guys. I just need to find help. [Engine revving] Come on! No! [Screams] I am not dying here. [Gun shot] [Growling] Ahhh...mother fucker! He's here. Are you OK? I'm OK. I just felt a little dizzy. Steve, it's me, Catherine, I need to know where Reeno is. Have you guys seen Lennie? No I haven't. He's gotta be around here somewhere. He's probably hung over he was totally shit faced last night. I was gonna go look for Tanya last night but... the next thing I knew I was out. Yeah. I slept pretty hard too man. We should go find them. Alright. [Scream] Look what the hell happened here? Someone's killed him. [Heavy breathing] Come. Now. [Monster voices] [Engine revving] - Shit man. - What? I told Catherine where Reeno was. Fuck man. We got a problem. Yeah we do. [Monster voices] [Action music] Oh god! I just don't want to have to be the one to ask Reeno. Coz if something happened to Catherine, no, not me. Catherine is a tough girl. She'll be OK until we get there. [Screaming] Stop screaming. Stop screaming. I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm here to help. I'm going to take my hand of you now. OK? Who are you? Reeno. You're Reeno? Sam talks about you with the things you've done all the time. I just thought they were told tails but Sam doesn't lie. Sometimes I wish they were told tails. What's your name? Tanya. Come on. [Monster voices] Wow let's get out and take care of this shit. No forget that man, we gotta find Reeno and Catherine What's wrong? Do you think they heard us? No they didn't hear us. Then what's wrong? Sam talks about you a lot. How long have you been with Joey? What difference does that make? Well it's a simple question. How long? Is he a good boyfriend? Two years. You're miserable Tanya. He's a terrible boyfriend. You brought him here because you were gonna breakup with him. No I needed his help? He cheats on me all the time. He thinks I don't know but I do. You'll have luck with Sam. How do you know that? You wouldn't believe me even if I told you Sam and I are really close. It's meant to be. You know it and so does he. [Reading from board] We have to find Maria Cruise's layer. That's where we'll find Sam and the others. I hope Sam's alright. I'm like Sam's brother, I'm not losing him too. He's good Tanya, but we need to find him ASAP. I tried to go for help but my car wouldn't start. Yeah it doesn't surprise me. You do know what's going on here don't you? It's the end of the word. Hardly. What is going on, is only going on here. What happens, depends on us. Us? [Growl] Shh. There is only two of them, it's OK. Hold this, don't fire unless you have too. We don't want them all coming at us. [Growling] [Splatter] You alright? OK let's go find Sam and that jack ass soon to be ex boyfriend of yours. [Smack] No sense of getting noisy about this. [Skull cracking] You're right man. There's a shit load of them out there. That's Maria Cruise for you darl. She's a much stronger demon. Much stronger. And a lot more contained. She's alive. It's OK. It's gonna be alright. What's your name. Amber. [Coughs] I saw her. I saw her. Maria Cruise. We know. It's OK honey, because we're here to stop her. Thank you. We gonna get you outta here. It's OK.

Let's get these mother fuckers. We should do something about Lennie's body. Like what exactly? I don't know what do you think we should do Joey? Leave it here for vultures? The vultures. I like the vultures. Seriously? What is wrong with the both of you? What is wrong with you? Come here Sam so I can snap your silly little neck. [Gun shot] Reeno! Tanya! Tanya you're still alive. Tina. I wouldn't do that if I were you. You're not me. I'm glad we found you. You're friend Joey is asking to get himself killed Sam. Yeah, don't I know it. Was this the school project you were telling me about? I'm afraid it is. I promised your brother I'd keep you safe. It's no accident you ended up here. That we all ended up here. What do you mean? You're chosen, like I was. Like your brother was. So why are you here? My case. Your case is here? It's Maria Cruise isn't it? Yes. You mean Maria Cruise is not a myth? Afraid not. We need to go find Tina and Joey. That chick that ran out, is not Tina. What? That woman is... That's Maria Cruise. Are you sure Tina? Yes I'm sure. What do you want me to do? Take the guy out with a stick? You sure this Reeno guys is the killer? Yes why would I lie to you? I know him, that's why I ran. There's no way out of here, we're stranded, you have to kill Reeno before he kills us all. Or...we can run away together. I don't know Tina. We can just walk out of here. You were ready to bail on Tanya. You know if they survive, Sam and Tanya will hook up. What do you know? I saw the way they looked at each other. So it's come to this eh? Yeah there's something there. But they are both loyal to me. Besides if they hooked up, it's long over due. I'm a shit of a boyfriend. Let's go then. I can make you forget all about her. I'm not leaving without them. Then you know what you must do. Kill Reeno, or he will kill Sam and Tanya. Fine. Where are you gonna be? Close by. Reeno. Demon hunters! How, did, they, find, me!!! It's not my fault! You're part of the clurgie, how can you do this to me? Because you are a damn worthless woman! Obviously cursed by God he has sewed up your womb. I'm sorry. My mistress could get pregnant but not you! It's not my fault. Silence. I don't want to hear anymore excuses. You'll be banished from a community as well as our ways. So you can marry your mistress? I said be silent! [Screams] [Choking] Your mistress is next. [Voice echos] Pledge to me and I'll make you strong. And get them back for treating you so badly. Joey! I'm glad you're still alive. Yeah, hey look man erm... Tina took off. They found a body down by the tree line. A body? Yeah, it's a little girl. - What little girl? - I've never seen her before. Show us! Right down here. Here? Yeah. [Crack] Ouch!! What the hell? Joey stop! You're gonna kill him. Get the fuck off me Sam. I had to kill him or he's gonna kill us all. [Laughter] Well done. I've been waiting for one of you fleshy fools to kill him for years. He's a noted warrior. You fool. Joey, he was your last hope. [Monster voice] Now I get to tare you apart! Run guys, run! Stop, let him go. Run for it. You! No! [Grunts - guts splatter] [Juicy ripping sounds] Run! [Laughter] God my kidney! [Laughter] Where's my brother Doug. Without Reeno? I didn't think anybody was ever going to stop him. And now Joey's gone too. We're going to die. No we're not! My brother and Reeno taught me how to fight. We are not dying. [Monster voices] [Crack] [Scream] Sam, Sam SAM!! [Screaming] [Gun shot] Tanya [Gun shot] - Did you hear that man? - Yeah. I heard it. I think it came from the North East. [Action music] Catherine! Are you two alright? We are now. Where's Reeno. Dead. No, no... he... not. It's true. Joey killed him. Reeno went down hard, we saw it. No, he isn't dead. I would know if he was. [Laughing] What? He went down? He's gonna be super pissed! I hope you are right. He's alright, I know he is, just believe. You believe too? God has plans for you. God has plans for both of you that is. You're such a strong woman. You're bad ass. You have to be married to Reeno. You'll be just like me some day. You just gotta trust God. All this very god mother bull shit about faith. Hey Reeno. Doug! What are you doing here man? Doug youâ€™re alive I... How? I don't understand No I'm not down there with you anymore. What? Where am I? What are you doing here man? You don't belong here. You gave me your word that you'll look after Sam. He's been my brother since the foster home. I have been looking out after Sam. You don't belong here. Doug? Come back man. Uncle Rick? Reeno. It's not your time yet. Remember what I taught you. It's just a container. Catherine! Steve. Jack! Where's Reeno? Reeno was attacked. We had to leave him. Reeno attacked by a container? No, no way. That's impossible. Not a container. Our friend killed him. He thought that he killed Lennie, so, he hit Reeno with a Log and Maria Cruise thanked him, then killed him. Catherine, do you think that our Reeno has gone? Not a chance. So you don't feel anything? I'm not a wizard. I know he's OK. Guys, look! [Monster sounds] Do you guys see anything? Yeah, looks like they're backing off now. They're what? Why are they doing something like that? Because they are a bunch of chicken shits. Nice of you to join the party! I wouldn't miss it! Joey? He didn't make it. Sorry guys. What are you doing here? You told me to follow you I didn't mean here. [Soft Piano and strings music takes over - dialogue goes quiet] Hey we have a little issue here. There's a shit load of them! [Gun shot] They're gonna rush us! Do you see Maria Cruise? No, just a lot of zombies. No she's not with them. She knows I'm not dead and she's getting desperate. Finish it Reeno. Take her out. Stay on guard right here. Alright then. Point that thing there, and squeeze the fucking trigger. Alright captain, are you ready to get this container? [Gun shots - struggle - monster sounds] [Gun shot] Reeno wait. We can't just leave them. Babe, Jackie is right, once we take out Maria Cruise the rest of the containers go down with her, now. We don't have a lot of time let's go. [Growling] Shut up! [Voices in her head] [VO] You are done bitch! Just stop talking. Shut up! She's close. I can feel her. I can feel you too. It's over. [Laughs] for your friends maybe. My slaves are taring them apart right now. She's lying. I know she is. [Gun shots - monster sounds] Jack look out. Oh shit. Oh god!!! Do you want to be free? I am free. I will never bow down to your Savior. NEVER!!! Have it your way. [Gun shots] [Roaring] Catherine give me your rifle. Find a new container, ass hole. [Screaming] Did you hear that scream? Yeah. Yeah I heard it. He got her. Damn right he did. So what do you wanna do now? We have to train up Sam and Tanya. Yeah I saw that too. She's his rep alright. Yeah she will be. We should get that. Why you think your friends are afraid of the dark? My friends aren't afraid of anything. [Piano music] [Music - fade in] Remember, remember. Here I am tonight with a million reasons why. I shouldn't write this song but you always come to mind. I can't think of one reason why. So I just turn the lights off, then I cry. The past comes back, I remember you Catherine. I can't forget, the day that we said Goodbye, Catherine. Now I think, I cannot understand, Catherine. I can never ever be your man. I can't erase the memories hat come into my mind. I really would like to see you and hope that you're doing fine. The things I want to say I can't put into words. But I can't change a thing no matter how it hurts. The past comes back, I remember you Catherine. I can't forget, the day that we said Goodbye, Catherine. Now I think, I cannot understand, Catherine. I can never ever be your man. I could never, hold your hand again, baby.... [Fade out]
