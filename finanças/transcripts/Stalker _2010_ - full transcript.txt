Honey, all I'm asking you to do. Is change his name. No. No, no, no, no, you don't understand. We'll be in so much trouble if you don't. I swear to God, we'll be hit by lawsuits. From every angle possible. Thank you, sweetheart. Okay. Well, I'll give it to the legals, But if they say it's a no, then it's a no. Okay, yeah, well, I've got to go. See you soon. Sorry about that. No, that's okay. Ah, Paula, how have you been? Fine. Yeah. Getting there. And how's the work coming on? Um, you know. It'll come. Yeah, well, I know it will. You're too good a writer. For that talent just to disappear. It just doesn't happen. Now, I don't want to put any more pressure on you, But we do have responsibilities, And ours is our deadline. I've got the printers and the whole shebang. Primed and ready to roll. Yeah, I know you have. You know what's funny? Most... most writers come to see me. Chomping at the bit for attention, Almost willing to get themselves into a lawsuit. To get a piece of the action... A piece of success, but... But you... I do want success. Oh, it's just... Come with me. Look at that. All those people. All that noise. How can you think, let alone write in this? Get away for a while. Go back home and get some rest, And try and get back in touch with your writing. I can't just leave. Trust me! Just go. It'll do you the wealth of good. Sync and corrections by R3V0LV3R. Thank you. "House is old, as you know, "and needs lots of care. "Please take your shoes off so you don't ruin the carpets. "If you have a problem with the lights, "the fuse box is in the cellar, "and I've left a bottle of wine in the fridge! Hope you drink white." "have a nice stay." Ooh. Deal with you later. Oi. Gonna give me a heart attack? Precious. Mm? Yeah. Oh, you're gorgeous, aren't you? Excuse me. Sara. Sara Phillips. Hmm? Robert Gainer. Book review. Yeah. Yeah, I know who you are. Ahh. Of course you do. I just wondered if I could ask you a couple of questions. About Paula Martin. Look, I'm... I'm sorry. I'm kind of busy at the moment. Um... Could you call the office in the morning? And we'll deal with it then. I'm sure it can wait. Ah, yes, well, I've been trying to contact you via the office. For over a month now. I'm just getting the runaround, you know? "She's not in today. "She's at lunch. She's away from her desk. She'll call you tomorrow." Not avoiding my calls, are you, Sara? 'Cause that's what it's starting to feel like. This conversation should not be happening here, Robert. All I want is an interview with your client Paula Martin. That's all. Paula is busy, I'm afraid. Ah, yes. Writing her second novel. Yeah, exactly. That's not what I heard, Sara. Oh? And what did you hear? Well, a little bird told me. That Paula Martin had a breakdown. Just after her last book went number one. Now, that's not unusual. There's a lot of it about. Just let her talk to me. Get it out in the open. Might free her up. It's a win-win situation, Sara. Listen, Mr. Gainer. There's nothing wrong with my client. She's in the country as we speak, Working quite happily on her next book, Away from... from people like you. She doesn't do interviews. You should know that, And if I read in your magazine gossip column. That Paula Martin had a breakdown, I'll use every penny we have taking you to court. Do you understand me? Now, before you say anything else, Go back to where you came from and sit down. You're embarrassing me and yourself. Okay. But I will get that interview, Sara, believe me. And gossip isn't really gossip. If the story's correct, right? Just tell her I'd like to talk to her, If you don't mind. Thank you very much. Excuse me. You are kidding me! Oh, God. Hello? Hello, Leo. It's Paula. Are you all right? Everything's confusing me. I mean, this fucking house. I haven't been here for years. Just calm down. I'm sure Sara will help you. Mm, yeah. Yeah, you're right. I'll call Sara. She could rent me a place in London or something, Couldn't she? Exactly. I just knew it was a stupid idea. Coming back here. Uh, look, Leo, I've really got to go. No. No, no, no. I'll call you when I get out of this place. Yeah. Bye. Just wanted to check if there's anything special. You need doing. Uh, no, that's okay. I was just on the phone. The room should be clean enough. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm Mrs. Brown, the housekeeper. Two days a week, mondays and thursdays, 9:00 till 5:00. Mondays is my wash day. Two days a week. Ooh, that looks nasty, dear. What happened to you? Oh, it's nothing. I just caught it on a nail. Stupid. Oh, well, I'll be down in the kitchen. Why don't I have a look at it for you? I can clean it up. You know, you really should get to a hospital with that. Why don't I clean it up for you, And you get yourself down there in a taxi? It's not far. In fact, I could come with you. I need a couple of things in town. Ah, I can't, really. I'm meant to be writing. Really, dear? Writing what? A book. Really? With a hand like this? Do you ever hear from my uncle? No. I haven't heard from him in years. Well, he was traveling the far east, Last thing we knew. Still, pays the wages, Pays the bills, Keeps this place going, So we carry on as normal, And when he gets back, It'll all be just as he left it. When was the last time you were here? Oh, must be... Oh, I don't know. Um, I can't remember. Well, I've been here nine. Really? Is it that long? Gosh. Last few years have been a bit of a blur. Look, I do know how this is gonna sound, But do you ever think this place is haunted? Haunted? What makes you say that, dear? Well, it's just... Just what? It's just me. Well, this is a very old house, And old houses have lots of secrets. Yeah. I know I'm just being a bit silly. You know where I am if you need me. Oh, and there's Joshua, the young gardener. Ah, yes, I heard him. - Two days a week, - 9:00 till 5:00. Got his work cut out keeping this place together. So have I. Now, look, I'm gonna give you a couple of painkillers. They might make you a bit drowsy, But from the looks of you, I don't think a few hours' sleep would go amiss. I have Robert Gainer on the line. Said he wants to make an apology for last night. And to see if you've changed your mind. He's on line one. Tell him I'm out at lunch. All day. Paula. Paula. I have something for you. Sara sent me. She said you were having trouble concentrating, And I was to help take the pressure off. Help speed up the writing process. And get you out of this place as quickly as we can. She said that's what you wanted... And by the looks of things, you could use the help. Are you okay? Oh, yeah, yeah. It's nothing. Yeah, she's right. It's... It's been a struggle, what with one thing and another. It's like this house doesn't want me to work. It doesn't want me to write this book. Sorry, I know how stupid that must sound. No. No, you're an artist. You're sensitive to your surroundings. And what beautiful surroundings. Oh, yes. It, um... it belongs to my uncle. He could be dead for all they know. They just keep it running for him. I spent quite a lot of time here when I was a kid... Summer holidays, a few christmases. How wonderful. Yeah. Distractions? How am I supposed to work with constant noise like that? Well, I wasn't really thinking about the noise. Just going into town to get those few bits. I'll see you later. Don't hurry back. Do you fancy a glass of wine? I'd love one. Come on. I'll get it. So tell me about the book. To be honest with you, There's not much to tell at the moment. Inspiration hasn't been exactly forthcoming. The last book that I wrote. Has been like a millstone. I mean, maybe... who knows? Maybe that was it. No, no. Come on, I read your last book. I know it well. It was controversial. It made people think. That's why it was such a success. Definitely not the work of a one-hit wonder. Can I be honest with you? Hmm? You need to have more faith in yourself. You just have a touch of anxiety. Little bit of writer's block? They say write about what you know. That's always a good place to start. You must have the beginnings of an idea to come out here. Kind of. Well, I thought I did. It's just... It's my head. It's not been in the right place. For a couple of years. I was sick, and I had to go into recovery for a while. That's great. No, I... I didn't mean that. I meant... Well, that would make a great book. Well, there isn't really that much. That I can remember about the whole thing, But who knows? Tomorrow is another day. Yeah. And this has been a long one. Now, where do I sleep? Come on. I'll show you to your room. I hope you're warm enough. It does get cold here at night. I put an extra blanket on the end of your bed. Oh, I used to stay in a house the same as this. Creaking floors, Plumbing, always cold at night, Even in the naves. Oh, I'm just in here. You know, you're prettier than your picture. Oh, thank you. Should we make a start first thing? Mm, bright and early. Morning's my favorite time of day. I never miss it. Oh, we'll get on just fine then. Um, you're in here. Hope that's okay. It's perfect. Night, then. Night. Sleep tight. Night. Paula? Paula. It's okay. It's okay. It's just a dream. It's just a nightmare. It's okay. It's just a dream. How are you this morning? Oh, fine. - You sure? - Yeah. I'm sorry if I frightened you last night. Oh, don't be silly. I'm all right. It was you I was worried about. I'm just a bit stretched at the moment, What with one thing and another. Can I give you some advice? Everyone else does. I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. Go on. Well, sometimes you're better off dealing with things. Than leaving it till tomorrow to sort out. Should we have a go at doing some work today? I thought we could make a start on something. If you're up for that. I suppose we got to start sometime. Well, I'll tell you what. If you could harness those dreams. You were having last night, You've got yourself your second best seller. Straight to number one. Selling books. It's all that anyone's interested in. It's as if it's the most important thing on the planet. My agent, Sara... She talks about a number one book. As though it's the holy grail. She's obsessed. Hmm. Sounds like someone's mistaken their agent for their friend. Of course she wants a best seller. Anyway, she's probably a frustrated writer. They're all the same. Always ready to tell you how to do it. But can't do it themselves. Yeah. Look, should we finish in here and make a start? I did have some stuff. I was just getting it down. When it got swallowed up in the computer. Okay, well, let's see if any of that comes back. I'll set up in the study if that's all right with you. Yeah, sure. Okay. Love. What is love? Is love an emotion, A feeling, or just a state of mind? Is it a way of life for some people? Just a dream for others? An unreachable dream. It was unclear to me, But I knew that I felt something... Something that made me feel uneasy; Something I couldn't quite relate to. Up until now, Everything that made me laugh, Cry, even lose my temper, Had been my personal secret. This was first time that I'd ever allowed... This was the first time I'd ever considered. Allowing to really get to know me properly. I'd never allowed anyone to get this close before... To explore my mind, Body, and soul... But the more secure I became, The more my insecurities. Found a way through. "The more secure I became, The more my insecurities found a way through." Yeah, I know what I wrote! And it is rubbish! Ah, it's like those crap novels. You find in the Oxfam shop! The dog-eared, yellow ones. That stink of old women. You might as well just pack up and go. I can't do this! Oh, for Christ's sake, what's wrong with me? Hello? Hello? Wait! Wait! Hello? Who's there? Like I said, Thanks again for seeing me so quickly. Not at all. Please. So how can I help you, Mr. Gainer? Please call me Robert. Robert. It's about one of your clients. Paula Martin. - Paula? - Yes, the author. Yeah, I know who she is. She's not just a client. She's a very good friend of mine. What is it, exactly, that you do? Well, I'll be straight with you. I'm a journalist, And I work for a magazine, The Book Review, And, well, I'd like a little bit of information. She's doing her second book, And we would like to help her publicize. Get behind her on this. You know that it's really tough out there. For writers these days, And they can do with all the help they can get. I can't discuss clients or friends. With anyone from a magazine. I'm sure you already know that. I'm sorry, Mr. Gainer. You've wasted your time. Personally speaking, I think it was a bit harsh, What they did to you. I mean, after all, You were just looking out for your client, weren't you? Woman had a bad reaction to a simple antidepressant. Clashed with another medication which I knew nothing about. I didn't see it 'cause she didn't put it on the form. You know, in situations like this, I usually find that a small fee helps. I've got 1,000 pounds here. I know you could do with it. Just tell me where she's staying. It's yours. Simple as that. What on earth do you think you're doing? Nothing. I just thought I'd help tidy it up a bit for you. Tidy it up? You saying there was something wrong with it? No, I didn't say it. You said it. You said it yesterday. You said it was rubbish. You said it was like one of those books. You find in Oxfam that nobody wants, Not me. I just thought I'd help you out. Yeah, well, don't. If I'd wanted to hire somebody to write my own book for me, Then I would have done it! Oh, my God! This has been a bloody joke! How dare you! You're my P.A., Not a bloody ghostwriter! Do you understand? I mean, look at it! There's bloody pages of it. You never, ever do this again! Never! Is that clear? Perfectly. Perfectly clear. I'll leave it to you. Hi. You okay? Yeah, I think so. What is it? Bad dreams? No. It's just me being stupid. Must have fallen asleep in the bath. And freaked myself out. Come in. Come in. Sit down. It was just really weird. I thought that... Look, Do you want to stay in here tonight? Oh, could I? Would you mind? Come on. You just need to get some sleep. You're getting yourself all stressed out. It won't do you any favors. Positive mental energy. That's what you need. Brings good things to you: Good health, good thoughts, And more importantly, good ideas. If you can do that, The book will take care of itself. Trust me. You know I'm right? Yeah, I do. Thank you. Don't worry about it. You just need a good night's sleep. I mean for the words. Just read it. It's fantastic. It's... It's so much darker, But it's everything that I wanted to write. It's everything that was in my head. But I couldn't get it out. Why don't you stay in bed tomorrow? Take it easy for the day. Let me do the worrying for you. That's why I'm here. Take the pressure off. Yeah, that would be nice. Try and get some sleep. What the hell is going on down there? I can't hear myself think, Let alone work! I didn't know Mrs. Brown was coming in today. It's not just that woman. It's the fucking gardener as well! What on earth do they think they're up to? I was on a roll down there, And if you could still remember what that feels like, Then you'd be kind enough to sort it out. Sort it out? What can I say? I don't care what you fucking say. Just get rid of them. Get them the fuck out of this house! It's either me or them... And without me, we're both fucked. Did they go? Oh, uh, yes, But I told them they could come back tomorrow. Said what? That they could come back tomorrow. Well, don't expect any work to happen tomorrow. And I'll have some coffee when you're ready. Sara. Hello. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'm feeling fine. Yeah, things are really starting to happen. I've hit a good vein. Yep. Yeah, yeah. I'd like to get on, though. All right... Thanks for calling. Bye. Paula! Paula! Oh. Paula Martin? Yes. The author? Yes. Can I help you? I'm rather busy. I I'm sorry. I didn't recognize you straight off. You look kind of... What? Well, different to your picture... But in a better sort of way, If you don't mind me saying so. Well, a little bit of makeup does wonders to you. Hey, uh, nice house. Is it yours? Mm. Yes. Um, what is it you want? I'm Robert Gainer. You might have heard of me. I'm a writer. I'm not in your category, But I work for a magazine. The Book? I thought you could fill me in on a few blanks. We could have a talk. Talk... Of course. Of course. Why don't you come in? Join me for a glass of wine. I think it's that time of day. Oh, and I think there's some cheese and biscuits. In the kitchen. All right. Thanks. That sounds great. Thank you very much. You know, If I'd known. That getting to talk to you. Was gonna be this pleasant, Would have caused me a lot less stress. Well, stress is the one thing I don't believe in. Anything to relieve stress is good in my book. What do you think, Robert? Hmm, yeah. So Paula, How's the book coming along? Fine. Why wouldn't it be? Well, I don't have to tell you. That there were some rumors floating around out there. About how you, uh... Running into difficulties. Had a little bit of a breakdown. So much so that you, um, Employed the services of a ghostwriter. Now, I don't believe a word of that. I know you're too much of a pro. But you wouldn't mind too much. If we talked a little bit. About the "breakdown," would you? Look, I know it's a sensitive subject, But sometimes it's good to talk... Get it out there in the open, And, well, Show the public the real Paula Martin. And you know something? I've got a sneaking suspicion. That it won't harm the sales of your new book either. I see. Let me get you some more wine. Thank you. So when did it all start? I mean, was it the, uh... Pressures of writing? Everyday life? I mean, look, there's no embarrassment in it either. You know that. It's all too common out there. Oh, no, you've got me wrong. I've no embarrassment. I'm happy to tell you what happened. - Oh, you are? - Mm. Where do I start? Would you mind very much. If I recorded this? You see, I don't want to misquote you, Paula, And I really would like to get it all down. Entirely in your own words. There you go. Let's go. We're ready. So... You want everything? Yeah, everything. My brother was fucking my brains out. From the age of 13, So I killed him! I ripped his fucking spleen out. While he was on top of me. Now you know everything. Thought you might like some cheese and biscuits. Oh, thank you. And how are you feeling? Any better? Yeah, a lot better. Thank you. Yeah, I think I'll get up tomorrow and do some work. - Do you, now? - Yeah, you were right. A day in bed has done me a barrel of good. I'll be the judge of that. There's nothing for you to worry about. That reporter that came this afternoon... It was Robert Gainer, wasn't it? What did he want? Oh, he just wanted a quick chat... A few words for the magazine. Don't worry. I was very polite. I gave him a drink, something to eat, And told him you couldn't see him. Because you didn't want to be disturbed. You were too busy hitting that deadline. Oh, thank you. Do you think he'll be coming back? Like I said, There's nothing for you to worry about. Are you comfortable? Yeah, thank you. Good. Just for the record, This is the 4th of February, 1997. Now, after "three," I want you to take a deep breath in. And breathe out slowly, okay? One... Two... Three. Paula, Tell me about your childhood. Tell me about your summer holidays. They were hot. So hot... Sometimes I could hardly breathe, As if there wasn't enough air. I know how stupid that sounds. Were you alone there? Hate. What is hate? An emotion that eats away at your soul. Until there's nothing left. Burns a hole in your heart. That seeps poison into your veins. Self-loathing is the most painful addiction... Disrespect for all that we are. Who am I? A soul waiting to escape the confines of her cell. Waiting to be set free from this world of torment... Until this world drips... Of blood. Paula, what on earth has happened? Oh, my poor thing. Come on. Sit down. Let me sort this out for you. I was just making some breakfast. I thought you'd be hungry. You hardly ate yesterday at all. Now, then, let's have a look at this. You see, you have to be very careful with open wounds. They get very messy if you don't look after them. Now, you need to take better care of this. And if it starts to give you any trouble, You just let me know, okay? What is it? Well? The book. The book. Don't you worry yourself about the book. I told you, I'm taking care of everything. Look at you. Just leave the mess to me. It's Mrs. Brown. I'll talk to her this time. Where's that bloody mop? Mrs. Brown. Hello? Leo. How you doing? Well, yeah, It has been a while, to say the least. What can I do for you? Listen, Leo, Why don't I come and see you? Get me out of the office for a while. Make this conversation a bit more private. It'll be nice to see you anyway. Mrs. Brown? Did you say you wanted Mrs. Brown? That's what I said. Look, I don't know if you heard me or not, But I've got to go, and she's supposed to come with me. Oh, Mrs. Brown... she's just down in the basement. Well, can you tell her I'm waiting for her? I've just got to get off sharpish. Why don't you tell her yourself? What, down the basement? Yeah, yeah, She's down there somewhere. Mrs. Brown? Mrs. Brown, are you down there? Well, when you see her, Can you tell her I'm leaving. And she'll have to get a taxi home tonight? Stupid fucking bitch. Ahh! You stupid fucking bitch! What do you want this time, huh? Never know how well off you are, Even when someone's trying to help you! Go away. Oh, please leave me alone, for God's sake! Leave me alone! Where's Mrs. Brown? She's in the cellar, You fucking whore! Can't take your call right now, So please leave a message. Leo. Leo! It's me. Oh, help me. She's trying to kill me! The girl that Sara hired. She's... You really didn't need to do that. Thanks very much. It's been a long time. Since a woman's bought me dinner, Especially one as beautiful as you. Listen, don't ruin it. But it was lovely. - Do you mind if I... - No. Well, cheers. You miss Paula, don't you? Yeah, of course I do. She was... she is... Still a major part of my life. But our relationship was never physical. We... We didn't want that. Of course, after the breakdown, well... So what was it you wanted to show me? Fucking bastard, you've been treating me like a fool. I should tear your fucking heart out. And ride the fucker out. You're the fucking devil himself, You fucking bastard! Who was that? Mrs. Brown? Mrs. Brown. Help me. Help me. Paula, please. Leo. It's the P.A. - She's after me. - Calm down. Paula. Who is she? A woman called Linda. I don't know her second name. She's already killed two people. Calm down. Voice on the tape. It's a woman called Linda. She's been stalking Paula since she was a little girl. She's back. Thought I heard you down there. Come on! Fuck you! Go on! My brother was fucking my brains out. From the age of 13, so I killed him! I ripped out his fucking spleen. While he was on top of me! Fucking my brains out from the age of 13, So I killed him! I ripped out his fucking spleen. While he was on top of... Fucking my brains out from the age of 13, So I killed him! I ripped out his fucking spleen. While he was on top of me. Fucking my brains out... You're telling me that this Linda. And Paula are the same person. How? Dissociative identity disorder. She's been coming to see me for nearly ten years. Some days were good, And that's when Paula would come through the door. Other days were bad. That's when Linda would show up. That's the voice you heard on the tape. What are you talking about? Paula and her brother. Spent all of their holidays here. He began to rape her at a young age. The older she got, the more she blocked it out, Till in the end, She created a separate person: Linda. She has absolutely no recollection. Of her brother at all. With a split personality. That could cope with the trauma. Whenever Paula's under stress, Linda shows up. That's right. Paula stabbed her brother when he was raping her. Tipped her over the edge. She was put under my supervision. Oh, my God, I sent Robert Gainer down there. You sent the reporter to the house? We thought it would help with publicity. Aw, Christ. What are you doing? You wanted to come. Linda? Where are you? I know you're here. Christ, what's that smell? Linda! Paula? Linda, it's Leo. All right, you stay here. Really? Linda, don't worry. Just want to talk to you. Linda? Paula, is that you? It's all right. I told you I'd come. Hey. Hey. I told you I'd come for you. You're safe now. This is brilliant. Absolutely bloody brilliant. It's okay. You're all right. It's over. You're right. It is over. Leo? Leo? Paula? Linda. Where do you think you're going with my work? Your biography. It's incredible. I've never read anything like it... Do you really think I am gonna let you walk out of here. With all my work? Where's Leo? Where is he? Oh, he's up in the bedroom. Do you want to see him? Sara. Get out of here. Get out of here while you can! Paula, please! This isn't you! Sara, please get out of here. I can't! Where's Leo? He's dead. I killed him. Where the fuck... Shit. Yeah. Hey. Yeah, police. I'm at Crow's... Crow's Hall! I don't know what the fuck is happening, But you have to get here quick! What? Oh, fuck! Shit. No! Ahh! So what was your relationship. To the party? What were your reasons. For coming out here in the first place? Miss. Miss, are you okay? Yeah. Everything is just. Perfect.
