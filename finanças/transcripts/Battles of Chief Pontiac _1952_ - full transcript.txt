(dramatic music) (tense drum music) (lighthearted music) (suspenseful music) - [Narrator] This is the city of Detroit. Where this teeming industrial metropolis now stands, there was some 200 years back, a small, guarded fort, protecting a handful of white settlers. (upbeat horn and drum music) Fort Detroit was surrounded by many Indian tribes. The most prominent of these was the Ottawas, a proud people who in the period from 1753 to 1769 was ruled over by Chief Pontiac. Pontiac was a great warrior. A man of faith who believed the Indian and white man could live together. The English, who controlled this territory, hired professional German soldiers known as Hessians to help patrol the area. One of the Hessian officers, a Colonel von Weber, did not share Pontiac's point of view. He was ambitious, ruthless, and greedy for power. (dramatic music) (warriors yelling) - As you predicted, sir, the attack did come as a complete surprise. - These Indians are fools and stupid. - What about the prisoners, sir? - There ought to be no prisoners. These are dangerous animals. - But what about the women and children, sir? - I said no prisoners. I meant no prisoners. Relay that as an order. - Yes, sir. - And set the village on fire! (dramatic music) (gunshots booming) (fire blazes) (men chattering) (men hollering) - My brothers. These are dangerous times. There is blood upon our land. I have hoped for peace. I've prayed for peace. I have even signed treaties that say we can live in peace. - Their treaties are words that lie. - [Man] When a white man wants more land, they break their treaties. - [Man] We want war! (men chattering) - Yes, but some of the white people are our friends. - The French are our friends. The red coats are our enemies. - They have killed out of women and children, and we want war. (men chattering) - The great spirit has shown me what is to come. Now that the moon is thin and new, return to your villages. Prepare well. For when the moon is full, rise and strike. (dramatic music) - General Amherst. - Ah, Colonel von Weber. Your tactics are proving most successful. After replenishing supplies, you'll advance by lake and river to Fort Detroit. - Very good, sir. Once we have eliminated all the natives in that territory, you will have control of the entire Great lakes region. - A most difficult mission, von Weber, but we have the utmost confidence in you. - Thank you, sir. - A Lieutenant Kent McIntire to see you, sir. - The ranger? - [Man] Yes, sir. Says it's a matter of greatest importance. - Send him in. Pray, excuse us. - Certainly. - Weren't you ordered to Buffalo? - Yes, sir. But I encountered a most serious situation. - Yes? - May I speak frankly, sir? - By all means, come to the point. - Well, sir, the point is, someone must order this Colonel von Weber to stop his butchery. - Colonel has heard your report at first hand. Colonel von Weber, Lieutenant Kent McIntire. - You are satisfied with my results, sir? - [Amherst] Most satisfied. However, these rangers have lived among the Indians for years, and we regard them highly. - I too understand the value of these rangers. But with your permission, sir, I shall continue to use my "abominable tactics" at my own discretion. - By all means, pray be seated. - Thank you, sir. Now, at Fort Detroit, am I to place my troops under Major Gladwin's command? - Well, that's customary. If the garrison's established, you're the reinforcements. - Yes, sir, but there's a question of rank. Gladwin's and mine. - Oh, I'm sure you and Gladwin will hit it off. Naturally in a crisis, you as a superior would assume command. - Thank you, sir. - Sir. Major Gladwin is respected by the Indians. - You shall see, McIntire. After another skirmish or two, there will be plenty of respect for von Weber. - Respect, Colonel? Never. You're already hated. Your methods are regarded with contempt. - Do you presume to criticize my methods? - Yes, sir. War is war. But there have always been some rules that have been respected by both sides. - Enough, gentlemen. Our goal is clearly defined. How we attain it is unimportant. - I came back here to warn you, sir. But thanks to this Colonel von Weber, the woods are full of angry whispers. Chief Pontiac believes in an eye for an eye. This means our women and children will not be spared. - Pontiac is the devil in warpaint, sir. A treacherous beast, with the brains of a fox and the fangs of a wolf. - Chief Pontiac is honest and generous with those he trusts. He believes this country is big enough for Indians and whites to live side by side in peace. So do I. - Sentiment such as yours is naive, Mr. McIntire. - However, as you have an excellent reputation, I have an assignment worthy of you. - You're aware I have previous orders, sir? - They're countermanded. Now, you will proceed as soon as possible to Fort Detroit. You will deliver certain dispatches to Major Gladwin. Inform him that reinforcements are on the way. If attacked, he is to hold the fort at all costs. - Yes, sir. (dramatic music) (lighthearted music) (Kent speaks in foreign language) (woman speaks in foreign language) (lighthearted music continues) (Indian tribal drum music) (calming music) (dramatic music) (men hollering) (suspenseful music) (gunshots booming) (tense music) (lighthearted music) (tense music) - Can't you understand? We must have water. (Pontiac speaks in foreign language) (dramatic music) Do you want to starve us? We must have food. Can't you leave us alone for a while? There's no place where we can run. (Pontiac speaks in foreign language) (dramatic music) (men chattering) - Don't look around. How long have you been a captive? - Three days. - Where are they taking you? - I don't know. - Where were you captured? - Fort Sandusky. - Any prisoners? - Us. - Any men? - Not that I know of. I saw them kill my father. Can you rescue us? - I'm alone. - Do you have a gun? - They have many guns. - Coward. - Are you married? - Do you think I'm in the mood for a proposal? - I'm not proposing. I'm only trying to help. Here, take this. - Why? - Indians respect marriage. What's your name? - Winifred Lancaster. - Related to Sir John? - My father. - Oh. (men chattering) (tense music) - Stay away. Stay away! - Come. Eat now. (tense music) - White Dog, drop gun. - I am friend of Ottawa people. Pontiac. - White Dog lies. (tense music) Here's proof. Take me to Pontiac. - You're my prisoner. Go! (dramatic music) (tense music) (men chattering in foreign language) - When do I see Pontiac? - Right now. - Chief Pontiac. My brother. - Great Chief, we bring pale face. Not French. Wear otter sign on wampum belt. - Welcome, my white brother. Do you come to speak or to listen? - I have words for Chief Pontiac alone. - This is my brother as is my son. I have not heard his voice in council for many moons. We will speak alone. - Great Chief. I do not trust this white man. - Do you come from the fort? - I have come on a long journey from the east. - Do you bring word of war or peace? - I've come to council peace. - My white brother has never spoken with a double tongue. I will listen. The war hatchet is buried between us. - Will my brother answer a question with a truth? - Chief Pontiac lies only to his enemies, not to his friends. - Do you expect help from the French in this war? - They've promised to help, but it has not come. - It will never come, my brother. The French and the English are at peace. - At peace? - They've signed treaties and sworn brotherhood. I've seen these treaties. - This is grave news, my brother. - I have still graver news. Many soldiers are coming by ship to reinforce the garrison at Fort Detroit. This ship is strong, and war canoes can do nothing against it. - We do not fear the red coats. My braves have held Fort Detroit under siege for one full moon past. - Nevertheless, my brother. It would be wise to consider. Their numbers are endless as the sands of the great water. If these armies fail, others and still greater ones will follow. - Yes, they will come. - [Kent] My brother once said that the Indian and the white man can live side by side. - That is my hope. But the white man must show that he has peace in his heart. He must prove this to us. Util then, there will be war. - Friend Pontiac. May I tell Major Gladwin that you will talk terms with him? He is a man with peace in his heart. - My brother. Go to the fort. Speak with your great white chief, Major Gladwin. If it is right, I will come there with my war chiefs to make a treaty, and the evil birds will fly no more, and peace will come to this land. Until then, my braves will hold siege on the fort, but will not attack again unless this peace talk fails. That is the agreement that I will make. (woman screams) A white captive held as hostage. - Sounds like she's being mistreated. - She is being courted by one of the braves. - Well, then she is in trouble. - The braves obey my laws when they're in my village. She will become his squaw only if she agrees. - May I see this woman? - Chia! Bring white woman. Woman be here soon. (Hawkbill yells) - Hawkbill. Make Indian chief. (Hawkbill stomps) Hawkbill kill many white men. (Hawkbill stomps) Hawkbill many scalped. (Winifred groans) Hawkbill kill many, many white man. (Hawkbill stomps) Hawkbill make good husband for white squaw. (Winifred groans) (kids laughing) - You come with me now. - I'll see you all hang for this. - My woman. - The white man lies. Me want woman. Take. - My white brother does not speak with a double tongue. - Here's proof. She wears the matching circle to my ring. My white brother does not lie. By the word of Pontiac, this is your woman. So long as she remains with the Indian people, your footsteps will follow in his trail. And may the fires of burn bright in your heart, for this, my white brother. - May evil follow you. - Hawkbill. Go in peace. This woman has been returned to her own man. She will live with us as one of my family. Squaw, follow me. Head down. - What? - Do as you're told, two paces behind. Quickly. Squaw make fire, cook food. - I will not! - Do as you're told, quickly. (kid speaks in foreign language) - Use Chia's tipi for bride's tent. - Bride? - Would you rather have Hawkbill? (calming music) - When we get back to civilization, I'll repay you for this. - And you want to stay mad all the time. It's very becoming. - I ought to throw this in your face. - Go ahead. Only if the squaw happens to see you, I have to beat you. It's an old Indian custom. - You wouldn't dare. - I'd have to. Otherwise they'd call me "squaw man". I'm no squaw man. - Sooner or later I'll have you court marshaled and shot. - Naughty kid. - The squaw can cook, but slow. - Need more furs for marriage bed? - No thanks, Chia. Nice, soft bed. - Nice, soft squaw. (Chia speaks in foreign language) (lighthearted music) - Well, little bride. I'm sleepy. - I'm glad. - I'll feel better in the morning. - You're not sleeping in here? - We'll talk about it at breakfast, huh? - You're not sleeping in here! (whimsical music) (Winifred groans) - Now... Will you be a good little bride and do as you're told? - I am not your bride, and I don't take orders! - You're my bride as long as you're in Indian Territory. And you'll learn to take orders. - Well, not from you. - Well, from somebody else then. I'm leaving. - Leaving? Why? - I'm going to Fort Detroit. - Please take me with you. - I can't. You're still Pontiac's hostage. He can exchange you for some Indian braves. - You mean I have to stay here alone? - You won't be alone, and you'll be safe. - But I want to go! Even if it is with you. - Well, thanks. But you're staying. - Oh, you're horrible! - You're right. (dramatic music) Chia. Take care of her while I'm gone. - Chia take care. She like you better when you come back. - Hey, see him! - If it's a rotten Indian, it's my shot. - It's a white man! A scout. Open the gate. (people chattering) - Where'd you come? - Any word of the ranger? - Where's the regulars? - When's the relief coming? - Ranger McIntire reporting to Major Gladwin. - Glad you got through. How ever did you do it? We're under siege here. - All quiet for the moment, isn't it? Thanks to me and my brother, Pontiac. - Brother? This way, sir. - Major, how are you? - Well, McIntire! How nice to see you. - General Amherst asked me to tell you that reinforcements are on the way. - Oh, at last. - Under command of Colonel von Weber. - Von Weber? Oh no! - You know him, sir? - Unfortunately, yes. - I understand. Mercenaries who fight for money instead of principle. - No, it's more than that. Von Weber, ever since he was captured and tortured by the Arapahos has been like a madman. His personal vengeance would shame the army. However, did you have much trouble getting here? - No, sir. Thanks to my friend, Pontiac. - You're a friend of Pontiac's? - Practically a member of his family, sir. He calls me his "little white brother". Now he's willing to come to the fort to discuss terms for peace. - Do you mean to say that Pontiac- - It's all very unofficial, sir. I hadn't the authority. I hope you won't give me away. - Give you away? My dear McIntire. Why, if there's any question, I'll say that I authorized you. - Then you'll talk with him? - Talk with him? I'll roll out the red carpet. But are you sure that this isn't a trick? Remember, he's a wily old fox. - He sure is. He'll lie and cheat and fox an enemy. But he'll be honest with me, sir. Because I'm his friend. You can count on that. - Oh, by the stroke of providence. My garrison besieged, almost out of rations, 10 men down with smallpox. - Smallpox? - Yes, we had a minor plague. 16 dead. But the doctor feels that he has it under control now. The news you bring more than offsets what we've been through. Do you know, McIntire, we can make history here in the next few days if we can just find the right formula for peace. Do you know what it is? - No, sir. I wish I did. - So do I. No, this is the time for men to get down upon their knees and pray for guidance. - Pontiac is praying for guidance too, sir. I guess it's all up to the great spirit now. - Are you trying to cook me? - Sweat house good. - I had a bath! - Bath? - Bath. Lake, water. Me clean. - Sweat house good for new squaw. Make ready for marriage night. White chief say take care of little white squaw. I take. - Oh, Mr. McIntire ordered this, did he? In England they treat lobsters like this. - Lobsters? - Oh, of course. You wouldn't know what a lobster is. Lobster is a fish, you eat. - Fish. I eat. (Winifred yells) (kids laughing) (water splashes) (Chia yells in foreign language) White skin. They think big magic. - That's it! Mr. McIntire must think redskin is big magic too. - Over. (horse gallops) White chief see new squaw. Fix. Happy. - Do you have a mirror? - Mirror? - Mirror. Look. - See self in water. - White chief not come back. Why? - Old squaw, him maybe forget. New squaw, him never forget. - You pretty. - Thank you, Lightfoot. - You pretty, pretty, pretty. - Oh, I like you too. - Go, squaw man, go. I-ya-ya. Wear every day. Wear marriage night. Keep magic. - I like your magic. - Big magic. Many papoose. 6, 9, 10. - Is this your idea or Mr. McIntire's? (Chia laughs) - There are only few men in fort. We kill some. Soon, others starve. We want war. (men speaking in foreign language) - A great ship is coming with food, and many soldiers. - The French leader say their great white father will send army to help Indian tribe. - This is a lie. The French canoes are gone from the lakes. Their army has sailed across the great waters. My white brother has read their treaties. - Maybe white brother lie. - My white brother does not lie. - White chief at the fort. Peace. (men speaking in foreign language) - Then major Gladwin will talk with me? - He will talk. - This is good. - Maybe this is trick. Maybe white man is spy. - Don't try so hard, Hawkbill. - If we go to fort, they take us prisoners and put us in jail. - White chief at the fort is a fine man. He does not want war. He wants to live in peace as brothers. - That is the way men should do. We will go to the fort. If your white chief has peace in his heart, I will know. And then we will end war. (men speaking in foreign language) - I am glad, my brother. - Maybe peace with big white chief, but no peace with you and me. - You can have many squaws, Hawkbill. - Saw white squaw first. With you and me, always war. - All right, then. If you want it that way. May the bridegroom come in? - You come. - You're lovely. - She little white swan, all ready for marriage night. - Thanks, Chia. - For your information and pleasure, I have been steamed. - Well, I wish I had been around to watch. - The day I find you in an English fort, I'll see to it the steaming is returned, to lobster color. Believe me, I will watch. - Out, Chia. The bride and groom are about to quarrel. - Chia, please stay. - Out. - I go. - I stay! - You squaw man for sure! I-ya-ya. - Isn't little white swan glad to see me back? - The other prisoners have been exchanged. - I know, I helped arrange for that. - Why wasn't I? - Before our honeymoon? (people chattering) (Chia speaking in foreign language) She says a messenger has just arrived from the braves around the fort. Let's see what he has to say. Squaw, stay behind (people murmuring) Schooner has arrived from the fort with reinforcements. - The army. That's wonderful. - I'm not so sure. - Good old English regulars, bless them. - They're not English regulars. They're Hessians. They couldn't have come at a worse time. - You must get right to the fort and tell them how many Indians are here and whether- - And ruin everything we've tried to do? - Which side are you on anyway? - I'm for peace. - Peace? You turncoat renegade! - Can't you get this through your head? If the peace plans work, we can walk out of here, and I don't care where you go. If they don't, and this village is attacked, all white prisoners will be killed. This includes you. (tense music) - It's reinforcements! (horn and drum music) (man speaks) (tense music) - Major Gladwin. General Amherst sends you greetings. - Thank you, sir. (man shouts) - Congratulations for holding on, Major. - Well, we've been scraping the bottom of the barrel for supplies, sir. - The schooner is loaded above the blimps of dry rations, and of course barreled meat, and plenty of ammunition. - Well, there may not be any more fighting. - I've arranged to discuss a peace treaty with Pontiac. - A treaty, sir? - Yes. They haven't fired a shot at us in days. The Indians have held us to a siege. - You will please to read the orders, Major. One does not treat with wild beasts, one destroys them. - General Amherst instructs me to turn over my command to you, sir. This is most unusual. - It is my rank, sir. I've got a troop of men afoot, an armed crew aboard the schooner, and I intend to use them. - Well, respecting your rank, sir, the leader of the Indians, Chief Pontiac, has been led to expect a peace conference here. - Oh? And how does one confer with a savage? - To his people, Pontiac is a great general, sir. He is in fact, a brilliant strategist, a man of stature and great dignity. But more important, he is the spiritual and religious leader of many tribes, sir. - Oh. A redskin messiah. Oh, Gladwin, my man. This siege has softened you. I'll show you how to deal with wild pigs. - I'm sorry you feel that way about it, sir, - For your information, Major, as soon as my men are rested, whether your peace conference has matured or not, I am moving against the enemy. - Well, I suggest we consolidate and hold the fort. We are surrounded by 2,000 picked braves, sir. - You didn't see them attack my schooner and cannon when I came in, did you? - I explained there was a truce. - In open combat, 100 of my soldiers are the equal of a thousand sneaking Indian swine who can't stand up against a bayonet. - This is not open country, sir, this is a forest. You will not see them, but they will be all around you. You will never have a chance to use a bayonet. - Are you disputing my authority, Major? - No, sir. But I should like to inform you that the responsibility will be all yours. - Quite. If you obstruct me in any way, I shall be forced to place you under arrest. Now, I should like to inspect the rest of the fort. Doctor. Doctor, what is the situation? - Well, sir, we're in luck. No new cases in the past four days. - Oh, that's good. How are the sick ones getting along? - Getting better. Slowly, of course, slowly. I'm a great believer in heat to destroy the smallpox pest. - Yes, of course. Of course. - Naturally we boil everything. Clothing, blankets, everything. - Yes. Yes, Doctor. Be so kind, follow me to Major Gladwin's office. Doctor. About these contaminated blankets and clothing. These articles would spread the disease, no? - Certainly, sir. The pox is highly contagious, that's why we boil everything. - Major Gladwin. How about you would like to send some gifts to the Indians? - Gifts, sir? - Yes, as a token of my friendship. - Well, it's an excellent idea. There's no better way to obtain an Indian's friendship than with gifts, sir. - I wish to send the blankets and clothing to Chief Pontiac's village. - Why, it'll poison them like flies, sir. - More potent than gunpowder, don't you think? - In all humanity, sir! - By humanity you refer of course, to my soldiers. It is my duty to protect their lives. - I refuse to be a party to it, sir. - You will do as you're told. Insubordination in the face of the enemy is a capital offense. You understand that. You have your orders. You respect my rank? - The offense is rank. It offends my soul. (tense music) - Compliments of Colonel von Weber, sir. Round about! Ho! (dramatic music) (people chattering) - Token of the white man's hope for peace. - Von Weber? - How many sons do your chiefs assemble at the fort? - Six. (people chattering) (lighthearted music) (man shouts) - Gentlemen. Colonel von Weber, Major Gladwin, Chief Pontiac. - It is an honor to have you here, sir. - I came here to speak for my people, and give their thanks for your generous gifts. But greater are their thanks for the high purpose of this peace meeting. - So this savage has come to beg for peace. - Chief Pontiac did not come to beg for peace, sir. He expected to be received as the head of an army. To state his terms and ask for ours. - Ridiculous, is it not? This creature comes here to state his terms and to ask ours, is that not ridiculous? - You're insulting him, sir. You're making a very grave mistake. - Major. It is my experience that an Indian does not understand the meaning of a treaty. I allowed you to come here out of courtesy to my junior officer, Major Gladwin, and out of curiosity. Now my curiosity is satisfied, I see no reason to continue this interview any further. Come back here! (von Weber yells) - They came under a flag of truth. - [Gladwin] Colonel von Weber, this is a matter of honor. Chief Pontiac came here as an ambassador of his people. - Are you instructing me on a point of honor, Major? - Yes. And on a matter of international law. I warn you, sir. General Amherst will have a complete report, and he will not approve of your actions. - Very well. Let them go. My action was intended only as a warning. - You destroyed everything we tried to do and started a war which I doubt any of us will survive. - We have already doomed Pontiac to defeat without placing one white life in jeopardy. What is the incubation period of the smallpox? 9 or 10 days, yes? He's had those blankets now 7 days. We shall attack Pontiac's village in full force four days from now. - With the compliments of Colonel von Weber. You monster. - I find you intolerably insulting. Arrest this man. - You are exceeding your authority, sir. Lieutenant McIntire is a free ranger, and is not technically under your command. - Every man in this fort is under my command, Major Gladwin. Including you. Take this man to the guardhouse! - Right, McIntire. - Count your mercies, me old mother used to say. When you're in trouble, count your mercies. - And I'll count them if you tell me what they are. - Well now, it's a merciful death is what is offered for you. A nice, clean death. Not messy like. - So it is. - Would you rather have an Indian's tomahawk splashing your brains about? - Why not? - Well now, that's important, that is. A man should be all present and accounted for, to make a proper funeral. When I'm buried, I intend to have me scalp on me head. If an Indian ever draws his scalping knife on me, I'll just says to him, "Ah, old brother. Look, soldier." Then I'll hand him me scalp, like this. He thinks it's magic, see? And it's painted red inside to look like blood. I'll bet you a month's pay it lets me off. - Yeah, you're a smart fella all right, Limey. - When me time comes, I aim to be a proper corpse, I do. - Thanks for brightening my last hours, Limey. - That's all right, mate. (tense music) (Kurt grunts) Here, here! I never said nothing about hanging! I talked him into this I did, and I scream death, I say... (tense music) (tools clanging) (dramatic music) Help! Call out the guards, me prisoner's gone! Help, help, help! - There he goes! - [Man] There he goes! - Sergeant! - What is it? - The prisoner, sir. - Hold on now. - There he goes! (gunshot booms) - Why, are you sure it's the prisoner? - Yes, sir. (gunshot booms) - Oh, he seems to have escaped. Why, it's unbelievable. And do of course notify the guard, will you? - Yes, sir. - Good day. (dramatic music) - White Dog. We finish private war. Now. - Forget it, Hawkbill. I have to get to the village. - Me want white squaw. Man who lives takes it. (dramatic music) (Hawkbill grunts) (people chattering) - Nobody make fool of Hawkbill. (women chattering) (melancholic music) - Chia. Chia! Chia! - All is not good. There's a great sickness upon my people. (people chanting) - The white man's disease. Rotten with pestilence. Straight from the isolation wards. - What? - Believe me, my brother. I did not know this. And this is not Major Gladwin's doing, I swear it. It's that von Weber. He was gonna have me shot. I had to break out of jail. - So that is why you came here. - Yes. - Go. Go now. For when the braves find out about this, even I may not be able to save you. - But I want to stay here. Keep the disease from the spreading to the other villagers. - Go! I fear for you and your little white squaw. (tense music) - Pontiac says we better get out of here quickly. What's the matter? - Chia. And Lightfoot. How did it happen? - Von Weber. - I'm so ashamed of my people. - Now, pay attention. I'm gonna draw you a map. How to get to the fort. If you follow it carefully, you may be able to get there alone. - What are you going to do? - Stay here and fight the pest. - It's too late. - No, it isn't. If all the blankets and clothing are boiled and burned, the disease can't spread. But the Indians would never do that. They wouldn't understand. They just die. - I'm going to stay too. - This may be your only chance to get away. - I'll stay. (woman sobs) (Winifred speaks in foreign language) (tense music) - Tired? - Not as tired as you. (people chattering) - I'm afraid those braves are blaming us for all this. - I think I know. I've seen them watching us. It frightened me. - Little bride, I think we'd better get out of here. (mysterious music) - Very much farther? - We can rest a while. - If we do get back to the fort, what will you do? - Well, the way I feel right now, I'd like to join Pontiac and fight von Weber. - I don't blame you. But can't that- - What is it, bride? - Oh, I hate the thought of you in danger. I don't want anything to happen to you. I don't want you hurt or court marshaled. - Or steamed like a lobster. (people chattering) (tense music) You must be in good standing with the great spirit. - Not me, you. - I will never settle that. - The great spirit has spoken. There is war. (tense music) War! (suspenseful music) (Indians shouting) (man shouts orders) - That's how we shall meet them. Indians never could stand cold steel. - It's your tactics, sir. It's useless for me to protest. - Quite. We will attack in formation, destroy the enemy, and march back in formation. - I can only hope some of you will get back, sir. We'll need you. - We will, I assure you. Until then, you are in command of the fort. - Very good, sir. (dramatic music) - Right face! - Open the gate! (von Weber shouts) (gate creaks) (dramatic music) (tense music) - We can both go into the fort now. - Are you sure you'll be safe? - For a while, anyway. With von Weber gone, Gladwin will be in command. (dramatic music) (gate creaks) Hold the gate! Coming through! - Who's that? - General Amherst! - General Amherst! Blimey, if it ain't me ruddy prisoner. - Sir! - Oh, McIntire. What are you doing here? - Well, I brought you back my squaw, sir. - Squaw? - I'm Winifred Lancaster. - Sir John's daughter? Oh. Well, how did you get through? - Well, it was as the saying goes, sir. Nip and tuck. We saw von Weber march out in parade, so I thought I'd pay you a visit while he's gone. - He isn't on parade, he's out to burn Indian villages. To destroy the enemy. He thinks he's gonna catch them all asleep. - He must be out of his mind, sir! - He expects to meet them in formation and with cold steel. - Thanks to those infected blankets, every tribe within a hundred miles of here is on the warpath. - Well, he doesn't know that. He's counting on catching them all unprepared. - That's suicide, sir. - Well, he must be warned, Lieutenant. - Is that an order, sir? - Oh, you can't make him go. Surely von Weber deserves whatever happens to him. - Yes, he does. But my concern is for the rank and file. The men, their wives. - What trail did he take, sir? - Through the French village and across the bridge. - Well, little squaw. Use your influence with the great spirit. Take care of her, sir. (dramatic music) - All woods from here? - Yes, sir. - How far is the village? - About half a mile, sir. - Good. From here, I go on foot. On foot! (tense music) (dramatic music) (Pontiac speaks in foreign language) (arrows firing) (suspenseful music) (gunshots booming) Form up! - Colonel, please sir. Let the men take cover. - Cover? The enemy has fled! Cover! - That's the way they fight, sir. They'll be back at us in a minute. - That's right, sir. - Fight? There's no fight, your action is a madness. The Indians are 20 to your 1. Disperse the men and retreat now. - We will not retreat! - Disperse, men, and look out for yourselves! (gunshot booms) (dramatic music) - Come back here! Come back! - That man is von Weber. I want him alive. - On your feet! Men, your last fight! Come on! Get up! Get up! (tense music) (people hollering) (Pontiac speaks in foreign language) (dramatic music) - I'm sorry, my dear. - We walked into a trap, sir. - Colonel von Weber? - Taken alive by the Indians, sir. - What about Lieutenant McIntire? - He tried to save us, ma'am. When von Weber... Von Weber shot him. The Indians took him with them too. - Alive? - I don't know. (dramatic music) (von Weber speaks in foreign language) (von Weber grunts) - I have experienced Indian torture before. - White man's torture. (Pontiac speaks in foreign language) - No! No! No! (von Weber speaks in foreign language) (von Weber screams) (dramatic music) (people speaking in foreign language) (tense music) Help me! (von Weber grunts) - Lieutenant. Have four horses saddled immediately. Also arrange a color guard and a white flag. - Yes, sir. Come on, my dear. We're going for a ride. (dramatic music) (inspiring music) (lighthearted music) I want to thank you, sir, for honoring our flag of truce. There is no longer any reason why we can't make peace. So I've come to discuss a treaty, sir, on your own terms. - No. Treaties are made with the lips and the sign. But peace comes only through our hearts. - I agree with you, sir. - The great spirit has spoken to my heart. Yes. The red coats will remain here for a time, but men like you who pour across the sea... The great spirit has shown me that these people will come in peace. The forest will be their home, and my people will no longer be. The Indian will disappear from this. This beloved land. (Pontiac speaks in foreign language) (lighthearted music)
