[Music] - They're brothers. They need to be raised together! My ex husband won't give me back my son. I have full legal custody. Cody! - Get in here. That's it, this is the last time. You know, you're already on probation for stealing. I'm tired of looking the other way. [Phone rings] - Hello? - You already have an important job. You report directly to some big wig v. P., and yet you want more? - I've been controller for a long time. I need a new challenge. - You said that you'd retire as soon as you qualify for a pension. Now, isn't that like less than a year away? Hey, get away from there! I just hung those feeders yesterday, and they already have it figured out. Great! They're not happy just eating the bird food, they ruin my dinner, too. Oh, look at this. I got this camera. I want to see what's going on when I'm not around. - I don't know what to do. Will you help me? Allan is never going to go for this. I just know it. Please show me the answer. Here's your breakfast. I hope you like it. - Pam, you're such a dear coming here and taking care of me. To think we hardly knew each other before my accident. - I know what it's like to be alone. After my divorce, raising two boys by myself with no one to help me, it was so hard. I promised myself if I got the chance to help someone, I would. - But you're so busy. You have a full-time job, and you have a family of your own. - My prayer group really wanted to help. We're all working together, so it's really not too much. - Thank you so much for all of your help. I'd really like to visit your prayer group if that's possible. The doctor did say that I can finally get out in a couple of weeks. - Oh, that's great. Absolutely, we would love to have you. You're welcome any time. - Thank you. - I do have to go, though, but I'll be back in a few days, okay? - Thank you so much. - In the meantime, if you need anything, please call, okay? - Hi. - Good morning Pam, how are you today? - Good morning, is Paul in? - Yes, he's expecting you, go on in. - I'm glad I caught you. - No problem, but I don't have long. I have an important meeting that I've got to get ready for. - I have a proposal for you. - Oh? - It's a cost savings idea. I want Keith's job. - Why, aren't you happy? - I still want to be controller. I just want to absorb his area. I can manage both departments. - I'm not sure that's such a good idea. - Why not? You're always saying you have too many direct reports. - They're both full-time positions. - Finance is humming. They barely need me. That frees me up to take on more responsibility. - I'm not sure. - You know how closely the two departments already work. We integrated that computer system together. - This is a senior level position we're talking about. I have to get corporate approval before I can make such a major decision. - Think of how much money the company will save. Give me a generous and fair increase, but the rest of the salary drops right to the bottom line. - I have to think about it. I'll let you know. - I love you. - You must be careful. I leave Russia and change our name to protect you. - Allan? Allan, can I talk with you a minute please? - Sure. - And before you say anything, would you just let me finish? - Okay. - My ex called earlier in the week, and he wants to send Cody up here. And I think it's the right thing to do. He needs a change, and his probation officer said he could be monitored in Michigan. - I don't know. - Maybe we can help him. He's my son. - I know he's your son. I just don't know if I can do this again. You do realize you're trying to fix your son, don't you? - That's what I do. I fix things. - That's what I love about you. But you can't fix this. - Why not? - Because we can fix things, but only god can fix people. - Oh, hey, mom. - Hi, how's it going? - Good, sorry we haven't called. - Yeah. Hi, how's our little Austin? How you doing? How you doing? - Your baby is beautiful. Your mom is always showing us pictures. - Thanks. Oh, Susan, this is my girlfriend Mandy. - Hi, Mandy, nice to meet you. This is my daughter Sarah. - Hi, we go to church with Pam. - Oh, I've been there once or twice. I liked it. - Yeah, I love it, the pastor's great, and there's something for everybody, you know? - In fact, Pam and I just started a prayer group. - Yeah, it's great, you should come some time. - Can I let you know? - Yeah. - Okay, well, it was nice seeing you guys. We gotta go meet some girlfriends for lunch. - Bye, mom. - Okay, see you. - I'll call you. - Bye, baby. - It's nice to meet you. - Your baby's beautiful. - Thanks. - Sorry, that was awkward. - Dustin, you should be nicer to your mom. - I just can't take it sometimes. - I like her. She just wants to be part of Austin's life. You can't blame her. - It's one thing to be part of our life, but she's always in our business telling us what to do. - At least you have a mother. - What about her always getting on our case about getting married? Doesn't that bother you? It drives me crazy. - Well, maybe we should get married. - What, are you serious? Since when do you want to get married? - I just found out I'm pregnant. - Keith's going to be here for another few weeks, so I need you to spend as much time as possible with him before he leaves. - Of course. - I got a meeting that I have to get to, but I did want to give you the good news. Kathleen will fill you in on the salary details. - Great. - One more thing. You're moving upstairs to a bigger office down the hall from me. It will get you closer to the action. - Thanks, Paul. - Congratulations. - Appreciate it, really. - Unfortunately, I have to leave soon. I have my daughter's birthday party to go to. - Oh, I understand. Family is important. - Salary details are all spelled out. - We need to discuss this. - What's to discuss? It's all there. - I'm not sure I want the job if you guys are only willing to give me a 5% increase. - What? Um, can we make this quick? I'm really in a hurry. - Why should I take on all of that responsibility for almost nothing? I know Keith made more than I did. - You asked for this job. You can't turn it down now. - Why not? I was expecting a generous increase, not this small amount. It's not worth it. - Paul is not going to be happy. He went to bat with corporate for you. - I don't care. I'm the controller. I know he has discretion over salaries. This is all you guys think I'm worth, then... I don't want the job. - I don't have time for this right now. I'll talk to Paul tomorrow. You can let yourself out. - It says in proverbs, "trust in the lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will direct your paths." What does it really mean to live this out in real life, to practice it? Especially when we know in reality, god rarely, if ever, speaks out loud to us. I tell you what I do. I get before the lord, I quiet myself before him, and I ask him to speak to me through his word and to reveal the path that he wants me to take. Father, thank you for being with us today teaching us in your word how to trust you more. We pray it all in Jesus' name, amen. God bless you and thank you. You're dismissed. - I'm going to go talk to the pastor. - All right. - Pam, hi. - Hi. How are things going at home? - Oh, about the same. Mark doesn't mind if I come out to church or not, but you know, it's just not for him. - Well, that is why we started the prayer group, to pray for our loved ones. - What about Mandy? Do you think she'll come out to our prayer group? - No, not really. Mandy wasn't raised in church, and I think since her mother died, she's really bitter towards god. - You know, she seemed really interested to me. - I don't know. - I spoke with pastor Ben about Cody. - Why did you do that? If I wanted him to know, I would have told him myself. - You might be interested to know he took your side. He told me I need to understand your point of view and how much you love your sons. He also told me that if I refused, it may really hurt our relationship. But just so it's clear, I would want to set down some guidelines so Cody understands our expectations while living in our home. - Of course? So if you still want him to come, it's okay with me. - Yes, thanks. - Pastor Ben was wondering if you'd be willing to talk to him about some of the struggles you're having with your sons. - No, I'm not willing to do that. - Why not? - I don't want him knowing our family's issues. The next thing you know, he'd want me to speak in church and tell my story. - Well, I told him I didn't you'd go for it. - I'd never be willing to share this in public. - Thanks for having us over, this was really great. - It was delicious. - Really enjoyed it. - It's an old family recipe. - Oh, yeah? I didn't know your last name was stouffers. [All laughing] - Too funny. I got a promotion at work earlier this week. I move into my new office on Monday. - Oh, great. - That's nice, honey. - I had to lobby for what I thought was a fair increase, but they ended up giving me what I asked for. So I'm pretty happy. - Good. - Thanks. - Hey, guys, come on over here. You gotta see this video of the squirrels that I took. It's great. - He's not overly supportive of my work career. I can't believe how much energy he spends on those squirrels. - It keeps him busy, doesn't it? - Good point. - Okay, I'm going to start clearing dishes. - You want some help in the kitchen? - Sure, thanks. [Laughing] - I can't believe you got that on film. - I know. And I got some great ideas on how to keep them off the feeder, too. - How? - Well, come on outside and I'll show you. - Did I mention that Cody's moving back home? - No. What does Allan think about it? - I really don't think he likes the idea. - I have to agree with him. - Well, it's settled, he's coming back. I just hope we can help him get back on track. - Security announcer: Please observe the no parking regulations for the upper and lower roadways. All unattended vehicles will be ticketed and towed at the owner's expense. Your cooperation is appreciated. - Wait, wait, I'm here, I'm here! You don't have to give me a ticket! - You're not supposed to leave your vehicle unattended, ma'am. - I just went inside for a minute. - You're not supposed to leave your car, and you're not supposed to park or stand either. So have a nice day. - Oh, come on. - It will be fine. - Come on, get in. Things need to be different this time. - We're home. - Hi, Cody. - Hey. - How was the flight? - It was good. I'm going to take my bags upstairs. I'll see you later. - Okay. - Pam? While you were gone, I wrote down some rules for Cody. Can we discuss them now so we're on the same page? You can add more to the list if you want. - These are fine. - I expect him to follow them. If not, he needs to leave. Agreed? - Yes. - Where is it? Forget it. - What happened in here? You just got home, and look at this place. - It's my room, isn't it? - Anyways, I'm glad you're home, son. - Thanks. - I thought tomorrow we could get up early, go to the bank, open an account, get a driver's license and then if there's time, I thought we could look for a job, okay? - I just got home. Don't I have one day to relax? - No. And clean up this room. By the way, these are the rules you need to follow while living in this home. - Where are you going? - I'm going to say goodbye to Pam. Where are you going? - Oh, no you don't dare. - You know, try and remember us little people as you move up the ladder. - You know I will. - We'll see. Hey, can I have you extra file cabinet? Whoever gets this office will never miss it. - Sure. - Hey, forget him. I need it more. - I thought you two were here to wish me well, not to try and scavenge my office. What are you doing? It's really not a good time, either. Maybe you guys can come back. - Who gets the file cabinet? - Why don't you two decide? - Hey, forget him. I need it more. - You know it's mine. - I'm next in line. - I need it more. - No, I was actually next in line. - So do you like your new office? - I do. - Off the record, I really admired the way you stood up to Paul. You drive a hard bargain. I'm glad it all worked out for you. - Yeah, I am, too. - Lunch next week? - Sure, you pick the place, and I'll be there. - Okay. - You'll never guess where I am. Yeah, I'm in my new office. - This is dawn, ladies. She's joining us today for the first time. - Hey, dawn. - We're really glad to have you. - Thank you for inviting me. - We're started this prayer group so we could pray for our loved ones that are struggling. - Many people don't understand what prayer is, but it's really not complicated. It's just talking to god. - Yes, god encourages us to bring our requests to him, but he's not Santa clause in the sky. He's more like a very close friends who's very dear to us. - Yeah, I just love spending time with him. It's my favorite time of day when I get to just sit and hear what he has to say to me. - Well, I'd like to pray for my husband Mark who's not a believer. And for my father Bob. He's really been struggling with his health lately. - And I'd like prayer for my sons Dustin and Cody. Neither one of them want anything to do with god. - I just want to praise god. I've been a year clean and sober today, so thank god for that. - Congratulations. - I try not to get overwhelmed, but since Ted died, it's been really hard. - Will be open us in prayer, Susan? - Uh-huh. Let's start with a little bit of music first. In psalms it says that god inhabits our praises, and then I'll pray. [Praise music] - Heavenly father, we thank you for being here today. Thank you for pouring out your presence on us. - What are you doing? - Oh, I'm rigging the feeder to keep the squirrels off it. You want to help? - Sure. - Why don't you go grab that line. Okay, let's do this together. - You want me to untie this? - Yeah, all the way out. Let me know what you're ready. - All right, I'm good. - Okay. Ready, go ahead. [Wood banging together] - You want me to tie it back up? - Yeah, just the way you saw it, okay. - Yep. - So, now that you're back in Michigan, what are your plans? - Um, not sure. I need a job and a car. - Yeah, I guess it doesn't help that we live so far from town. - Yeah, really. - You want a beer? - Last time I drank, I got arrested. - Yeah, that figures. You can't even have a drink without getting in trouble. - Give me a break, you do things, too. You just haven't got caught yet. - Hey, how are things going with mom and Allan? - Not too bad. They just want to drag me to church. - Oh, that can't be that bad. - The place is full of hypocrites. Dad never made me go. - That's just an hour. Just do it if it makes them happy. - I don't see you going. - Yeah, I don't live at their house anymore. - Whatever. - Hey, Dustin, could you give me a beer? - Yeah. - Thanks. - Uh-huh. - So Cody, I heard you were on probation. What for? - Breaking into cars mostly, and selling the stuff. - Why would you do that? - Seemed exciting at the time. - Yeah, until you got caught. - You got a girlfriend and a kid. How's that working out for you? - Whatever, dude, it's not so bad. Mandy's pregnant again. - Wow. Two kids? Congratulations, I guess. - Any advice on what to tell mom? - You're on your own there, bro. - Yeah, thanks a lot. - Hey, all right. - Good job. - So did Cody tell you he got a job? - No, where at? - The park in milford as a grounds keeper. I start Wednesday. - Nice. - Okay, time for presents. Yeah, it's really nice that you guys have birthdays two days apart. - Thank you. Oh, it's a gift card. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Oh, it's a journal. - When I read the Bible, I like to write down what I think god's saying to me. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Another gift card. Thanks, Cody. - No problem. I also got one for Austin. Here you go, buddy. - Yeah! - You like that? - My turn. A gift card to my favorite restaurant. Thanks, Dustin and Mandy. And now... What is this, Cody? - It's so you can shoot the squirrels. I bought it online. - Hey, let's go outside and check it out. - All right, sweet, let's go. - Is it okay if I come to one of your prayer meetings? - Sure. - I can't believe it. Are you serious? - Yeah, I'm interested in learning about god. Maybe I'll even pray for you. - Oh, thanks. No, I don't need prayer. - Everybody could use prayer, son. - I'll be right back. [Austin crying] - Grandma loves you. Yeah, here. - All right, we'll be right back. Thank you. - So how's work going? - It's slowing down, so I get a chance to relax now. - That's good. - Yeah. Hey, I've got something to tell you about Mandy and I. - Really? Hey, wait, wait, let me guess. You and her are going to get married finally. - Mom, no. Listen, we're not going to get married, all right? And if we do, it will be our decision. - So what's your news? - You know what? Never mind. - Why don't you go get your brother and the others, and we can cut the cake. - What was wrong with Larry today? - The boss, get used to it. You want a hit? - Sure. - So did you grow up around here? - No, I lived in Texas until my parents split up. Then we moved to Michigan with my grandma. - How old were you? - I don't know, 8 or 9. Later when I was in 6th grade, my mom sent me back down to San Antonio to live with my dad. - So you went to high school in Texas? - It's complicated. I lived in Texas. Then back to Michigan, and then I went to military school in Indiana and three different wilderness schools out west, and then back to Texas for the past three years. Oh, and I spent some time in Florida. - How many schools did you go to? - I lost count after ten. - And to think I used to complain about how I grew up. - It wasn't that bad. I have a brother, Dustin. We have some good times. Unfortunately, they kept us separate. I guess they found it was easier that way. - So you've been arrested? - That's a different story. It's starting to rain. Give me a lift? - Sure. - All right. - Thank you for your faithfulness. - Are you looking for something? - Where are the glasses? - The same place they've always been. In a cupboard over there. - Okay, thank you. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. I'm just a little tired. I'm going to go to bed, though. Is that all right? - Sure. - All right, good night. - Good night. - It was a really nice idea getting to the for lunch. Thanks for suggesting it. - No problem, every once in a while I have a good idea. - And I appreciate it. - Hey, um... Mandy's pregnant again. - What? How are you going to make it with another baby? - Mom, we both have jobs. We'll be fine. - Are you going to get married? - Oh, brother. Will you get off my back about that? - How are they going to feel when they get older and find out their parents aren't even married? - It's not that big a deal. You know what? Us staying together isn't the issue. We love each other. Why is it so important to you that we get married? - I raised you all those years going to church, and you don't know the answer to that? - You know what? That's it, isn't it? You just care what your friends at church think. - No, that's not it. Sometimes you just need to do the right thing. - Yeah, but why do you get to be the one who decides what's right? - I'll tell you what, I'll give you $5,000 cash if you marry Mandy. - What? - I'm serious. I'll give you $5,000 cash. You have 30 days to decide, and you can't tell anyone, especially Allan. - I can't believe you're serious. You know, I'm not one of your problems that needs fixing, mom. - Can I get you to shut the door, please? - Okay. Is something wrong? - We got a problem. Cody's tested positive for marijuana. - What? - I got the results back a few days ago. - Cody? - I didn't smoke anything, I swear. You know the concert I was at with Dustin? There was people smoking all over. It's got to be from that. - That's not the way it works. The results are 99% accurate. You don't test positive just because you breathe it. You have to smoke it. - I didn't smoke anything. There's something wrong with your test. - What does this mean? - This is a big deal. We monitor his probation for Texas, and I'm not sure what they'll do. - Is it possible he's telling the truth? - Yeah, I guess anything's possible, but not likely. - Since Cody's been back, he's done everything we've asked. He's been following all of our rules and hasn't caused any trouble. He's got a job, and does whatever we ask around the house. I'd like to give him the benefit of the doubt. - That's not for me to say. We'll have to see what Texas says. Cody, you need to be sure that you stay away from drugs and everyone who's smoking them. Understand? - Yeah. - So what happens next? - We'll have to wait and see. He's violated probation. Technically, his p. O. In Texas can have him extradited and sent to jail. - Oh, hey Alan, this is Jason. I'll be right back. - Nice to meet you. - Hey. What are you making? - Oh, a cross for the children's department at our church. - Cool. It's big. - Yeah. I guess they wanted to make an impact. Do you go to church? - No. Well, I mean I used to. My grandma used to take me. - Hmmm. Why'd you stop? - I don't know. I guess I just grew out of it. - Yeah. I used to think there wasn't much reason to go to church. I even became an atheist. - Really? - Yeah, for a while. I grew up going to church every week as a kid, but after I got older and moved out on my own, I figured I didn't need god. - How come? - A friend of mine said if there really was a god, there wouldn't be so many bad things happening in the world. I thought about it and decided he was right. - What changed your mind? - Well, I realized that just because I didn't understand who god was didn't mean he didn't exist. And I thought what if there's really a god. Well, I didn't want to miss out on heaven, and worse yet I certainly didn't want to go to hell. - It's a good point. - Let me show you a squirrel trap I'm working on. - Cool. - See, when the squirrel gets close enough, this will trip and the lid that I put on it, it's gonna slam right down and will trap-- - Jason, you ready to go? - Yeah. Nice talking to you. Good luck with your squirrels. - Ready? - Hi, Mandy. - Hi. - Mandy, we're so glad you could join us today. - Thanks for inviting me. I, um, I've never been to anything like this before. - It can feel weird at first, but just relax and listen. Do you have any prayer requests that you'd like to share? - Well, I don't really know how this prayer thing or any of this god stuff works. If I had to say I had a prayer, it would probably be to get married to my boyfriend. But he doesn't want to get married, so-- - you know, that's okay Mandy. We will all pray together for that. - Thank you. - And you know, god does work in ways that we just don't understand. - Before we start, let's talk about journaling. It's something I started recently and it's really helped. - I never really know what to write down. It just seems like a really difficult thing for me. - Well, all I do is write down the scriptures that are meaningful to me, then I journal how it applies to my life. I don't think god wants us to be totally passive. I don't think he wants us to just pray. I think he wants us to do more. - Uh-huh. - What do you mean? - Well, if we're just praying, it feels like we're being lazy. - You know, it's really not being lazy waiting on the lord. - Maybe you're right. It's an area I really struggle with. I'm used to taking charge at work, getting things done, and I'm just not good at waiting for god. - Uh-huh. - No, not always. - You know what? Before we start praying, I want to give this to Mandy. It was my mother's, and I just want to give you this necklace. You know, I don't have a daughter but maybe one day you'll be my daughter. - Thank you. - Oh, you're welcome, honey. - Well, why don't we pray. Heavenly father, we just thank you for being here amongst us today. Your presence is so sweet. We love you so much. - Yes, god. And we just lift up Mandy and Dustin and-- - come on. - I'm coming. - Surprise. It's an early birthday gift. It was Alan's idea. - Wow. - You've been doing good, you've got a job. This will give you some independence. - Yeah, he's gotta have wheels. Why don't you take it for a test drive. [Revving engine] - Didn't even say thank you. - You know he was grateful. He was overwhelmed. It was his way of saying thanks. - Maybe you're right. But it would have been nice to hear it. - I'm gonna miss you. - It's only a three day conference. - It always seems so long. - Well, I'm excited. I'll get to meet other logistics managers and do some networking. - That's good. - Face time at corporate can really help my career. - Didn't you just get a promotion? Did you forget you're gonna retire soon? - I want to see how far up the ladder I can go before I actually stop working. - What about Cody while you're gone? - It will be good for the two of you to spend some time together. - Yeah, maybe. [Piano music] - Hey. - Hey, how's it going? - Good. Jason and I are hanging out tonight. He's gonna drop me off at Dustin's afterwards. - Oh, okay. - Yep. I'll be right back. - Hey, want to have a seat? Good to see you. - So you making any progress on your squirrel catcher? - It's a squirrel deterrent device. Or s.D.D. For short. - You gonna patent that thing? - Maybe. - So I was thinking about what you said last time. - About what? - You know, when you said, what if there really is a god. I've just been thinking about it, a lot actually. - Oh, at this point, I'm firmly convinced it is true. - But what makes you so sure? - When given the facts, most people will admit that Jesus truly lived. But they don't want to acknowledge that he was the son of god. They just want to label him like a good person or a wise teacher. The truth is there's only two ways to look at Jesus. Either he's who he said he was, or he's a liar. - I'm not sure I follow you. - Oh, people like to say he was a good person, yet at the same time, they don't want to believe he was god. But that's exactly who he claimed he was. As for me, I've made mistakes. I've got regrets. But what changed my life was I went to church and listened with an open mind and really tried to understand all about Jesus and about god. - So what happened? - Well, I slowly realized it's about relationship. I started reading the Bible for myself and it started making more sense. It was like a great burden was lifted. - Kind of sounds like something my grandma would tell me. - She sounds like a wise woman. One of the biggest blessings that happened since-- - ready? - Yeah. We'll see you. - Oh, all right. See you later. - Sorry he was harassing you about god. - It's all right. I kind of like talking to him. - Better you than me. - Oh! No way. - Yeah! - Come on. Jump! - No, are you gonna let me in or no! - No. I'm coming out here. - Here we go. - Oh, no! Turn it off. I'm done. - It's just a game! - Turn it off! - Why are you getting so mad? You can't let your brother win? - I'm not mad. Stupid game. - How many controllers have you broken? - I remember you getting mad at military camp. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Remember you freaked out? Yeah, you know what I'm talking about. The camp counselor woke us all up. We were out looking for you at 1:00 in the morning. You're hiding in the corn field. - I was trying to break free. - Break free? - Yeah! - What a loser. - Speak for yourself. I want something to drink. You want anything? - No, I'm good. - All right. - I told mom Mandy's pregnant. - Did she freak out? - Yeah. She offered me $5,000 dollars if I'd get married to her. - Did you take it? - No, I didn't take it. - Why not? It's $5,000 dollars! I'd marry Mandy for $5,000 dollars. - I don't know. Just seems like she tries to control everything. - I think you should take it. - Well, we'll see. All right, rematch. We'll do it again. - You gonna calm down for this one? - Yeah, I'll be fine. I got 30 days to do it. - Well, at least for those 30 days, she'll focus on you. And she'll back out of my life. So it's a win win for me. Take your time. - Yeah. - Oh, I'm a different guy now. - Got a light? - Yeah. - So do you ever think about god? - No. Why? - I don't know. Thinking. Maybe there's more to life than getting high. - I like getting high. It's just one way for me to feel normal. It sounds like Alan's getting to you. - Why are you so against what he says? - He's trying to run my life. - Your parents don't seem so bad to me. - You don't get it. My mom is so controlling. She even offered my brother money to get married. - That's a bit much. - You think? Her marriage didn't even work. Who does she think she is? My mom drove my dad away. She packed us up in the middle of the night and hauled us up here to live. She didn't even tell us they were getting a divorce until a week before it was final. She didn't care what me or my brother thought. - What about your dad? - He's not much better. When I was fourteen, they sent me to juvie. He could have got me out. But instead he went on vacation. I couldn't leave unless he was in the state. He left anyways. - Wow. - Yeah. - Sorry. - It's all right. Wanna get going? - Yeah. Wanna crash at my house? - Sure. It's better than mine. - Yeah, I just got back from my business trip. Have you seen Cody? - He was here one night, but I thought he went home. Sorry, I don't know where he is. - Okay. Listen, if you hear from him, will you give me a call, please? - All right. Okay. - Thanks. Bye. [Sighing] - What are you doing? - Oh, nothing. Hey, I'm just tired. It was a long trip. - You seem tense. - Well, I'm not. - You wanted to see me? - Yeah. Would you shut the door, please? - Woe. This must be serious. - Have a seat. - So, what's up? - I need to talk to you about the sales forecast you submitted. It's too high based on what you said at the last staff meeting. - That was three weeks ago. Things change. - Come on, Jack. You're padding the sales forecast. There's no way they're gonna use all that up and we're gonna be stuck with all that inventory. You know corporate changed the guidelines. We're being watched much more closely on absolute inventory levels. You can't inflate the numbers just in case. - They're not inflated. There's a very real possibility that those projections are gonna move upward. - When and if they do, that's the time to change the schedule. - Don't you get it? Good customer service is about having the product ready when the customer wants it. - Jack is being impossible. He refuses to put a realistic billed forecast into the system. - You need to challenge him then and get to the bottom of it. You're in charge of inventory. - I can only order what your sales department puts in the system. - That's all part of the job you signed up for. - I willingly accept responsibility for ordering and stocking material, but you can't expect me to control your sales department. - You need to take this up with Jack. - Jack won't budge on this. I need your help and support. - You two will just have to figure something out. Your time's up. - Since when am I the only one responsible for absolute inventory levels? - It wasn't my idea for you to take on two jobs. - Where have you been? Why haven't you called? I've been worried sick about you. I can't do my job and be thinking about you at the same time. - Would you just listen. My car ran out of gas, and before I was able to get it back, the cops towed it away. - What? - Yeah. I need you to take me over there to get it. - Where is it? - Near Jason's grandma's house. - That's over an hour away. - Are you gonna help me or not? - I have a job. I have an important meeting I cannot miss this afternoon. I have some time this morning. If we go right now I can take you. - Can I get changed first? - I'll give you ten minutes. Then we have to go. - Cody, what's going on? - He's just having a bad morning. Go. [Bell ringing] - Yeah. - My son's car was impounded yesterday. How do I get it back? - Do you have any paperwork? Here, fill that out. [Bell ringing] - I need a pen, please. - Um, it shows here the police department has a hold on your car. - What police department? - You need to go there and get a release. - Do you have a phone number for it? - Here you go. That don't work, try 911. - Hi, I'm detective middleton. - Hi. Pam Carlson. - I understand you've been inquiring about the vehicle that's been impounded. - That's my son's car. We're trying to get it back. - It's not gonna happen. It's evidence for an investigation. - What investigation? - The police searched his car. They found baggies with pills in there, the pills look like they're ready to be delivered on the street. We sent the pills to our lab in Lansing for analysis. If they come back illegal drugs or controlled substance, then we're gonna have to charge your son with intent to deliver drugs, which is a felony. - They searched my car illegally. They had no right. - What's going on, Cody? - Those are my ritalin pills from when I was a kid. The police had no right to take them. - Like I said, ma'am, they were in baggies, not in any legal prescription bottle. If it's ritalin, that's an amphetamine. It's sold on the streets all day long illegally. - What about his car. - Well, the lab's backed up right now. But you can't recover the vehicle until the case is settled. It could be months. - It won't be very long before the impound fees are greater than the car's worth. Is there anything else we can do? - Well, there is one other option. You can donate the car to a police charity. It's then sold at auction. The money pays for the impound fees. Otherwise Cody is liable for all the cost of the car. - I did bring the title to get the car back. If he endorses it over, would that be good enough? - Yes. That would be fine. - Well it doesn't seem like you have much of a choice. - Here. - Nothing's gonna happen for a while. Once we get the lab results back then the district attorney is gonna decide whether or not he's gonna charge Cody. - Okay. Thanks for your help. - Not a problem. Good luck to you. - Well, you better not say anything until I figure out how to tell Alan. I tell you what, he's not gonna be very happy about this either. [Knock at door] - Cody! Wake up! You're going to be late for work. Cody. Cody, wake up. You're gonna be late for work. - No problem. I don't work there anymore. [Door slams] - You need to give me Cody back. I already missed my flight. - He's staying with me. - You know what? That's not the way it works. - You keep one, I'll keep one. - They're brothers, they need to be raised together. - What's going on here? - My ex husband won't give me back my son. I have full legal custody. - Do you have your custody paperwork? - Ma'am, this paperwork is from Michigan. I can't enforce this. - It's legal and binding. - You two will have to work this out amongst yourself or go to court in Texas, but I can't enforce this. I'm sorry. - Cody... Cody... [Whispering] Cody. Cody. Cody, I need you. I know you're tired. Oh, honey, get your shoes. Get your shoes. Get your jacket. Hurry, honey. Honey, don't worry about anything else. We'll get everything else. We'll buy you new stuff. Don't worry. Shhh, quiet. Quiet. Don't fall. Oh, good job. Good job. Come on. - Oh, lord, I need your help. I need you to watch over Cody. I've lost him somewhere along the way. I just don't know what to do. Oh, lord, I need you to save him, protect him, and watch over him, lord. Please, god. Please be with him. - That doesn't make any sense. Are you sure that's right? - It looks right. - Where did you get the schedule from? - Jack gave it to me himself. - That's just great! You know, we're the ones who are gonna get blamed for this, not sales. [Recorded message] - Hi, Pam. This is Jack. I checked the projections and they look good to me. I'm leaving them where they are. - Great. You do that. [Recorded message] - Hi, mom. Dustin. Hey, if your deal is still good, um, Mandy and I will get married in the next couple of weeks. Okay? - Wow. - But you can't tell her about it, all right mom? Talk to you later. - It's about time. - How's it going? - Hey, Jason. How have you been? - Pretty good. Just thought I'd stop by on my way home from work and see what Cody's been up to. Is he here? - I don't think so. His car's gone. Don't you see him at work? - Um, not lately. Just let him know I stopped by. Oh, I went to church with my grandma last week. I really liked it. - Oh, that's great. - Hi guys. - Hi. I gotta run. See ya. - See ya. - Why hasn't Jason seen Cody at work? - I don't know. I've gotta go start dinner. - What is wrong with you? - I'm sorry I'm late. - Hi, Mandy. - How are things with Cody, Pam? - Not good. He lost his job. - What happened? - I don't really know. Either he wasn't showing up or he was doing a poor job. But I'm gonna help him find another job next week. - Pam, don't you think you might be enabling Cody? I mean, shouldn't he find his own job? - I'm his mother and I feel like I need to help him. - Well ladies, I think we should pray now. We'll ask god to give Pam direction and to lead her steps and just to give her wisdom and discernment. - Before we pray, can I tell you all a big praise I have? Dustin wants to get married. - Oh! - I'm so happy for you! - In fact, it's in two weeks and you all are invited to the reception. - Oh, of course! - That's great news, Mandy. We do need to get started. Linda, will you open us in prayer, please? - Sure, I would love to. Dear father, we so thank you that we could come before you. Father god, we just pray right now for Pam, that you will come alongside of her and lead her and guide her. [Alarm beeping] - At least you're safe. I love you, Austin. - Cody, wake up! [Siren blaring] [Phone ringing] - Hello? - Are you the parent of Cody farmer? - Yes. - We have your son Cody, and your car's been impounded. - What? - Your car is at the tri city impound. Tell me when you have a pencil and paper and I'll give you the telephone number. - Okay. Okay, thank you. - What's going on? - That was the police. Our car's been impounded and Cody's at the police station. - You got the title? - It's in my purse. - It's nice somebody can get some sleep. It's time to go. Get up right now. - Hey, buddy. How's it going? - Cody, come back here. You need to leave this house today. Do you understand? - I love you. Grandma's sad right now. - Pam, come here. What else aren't you telling me? I asked you a question. You need to answer me. - What do you want me to say? That my son's a screw up? That his car was impounded by the police? That he got fired from his job? That he's a drug addict? Is that what you want to hear? [Music] - Pam. - You know, inventory has climbed $300,000 and it's all because of your sales forecast. - Ok. That's fine. - I just don't want you to be surprised at the next staff meeting. - Ok. No surprises. Whatever. - You know, there's still time to reduce the forecast. - No. I like the numbers just the way they are. - They're too high. - Ok. If you think so, that's fine. Thanks for the warning. Appreciate it. See ya. [Music] - What are you doing? - I was just straightening up a little bit. - Pam, there's no quota here. Just sit down and relax. - I don't know if I can relax. Straightening up helps me. It just seems like it's the one thing I can control. I don't like clutter. It bothers me. I grew up in a messy home. I wouldn't even let me friends come in the house. - Your home is immaculate. You should see mine some days. It's a disaster today. What's really bothering you? - I just feel like my world is falling apart. Things aren't good with Cody, and I'm having issues at work. I just don't think I can take it any longer. - Don't worry. I'm going to call the prayer group and we're going to get praying, ok? Don't worry. Just don't give up. - Thanks. I don't know what I would do without you guys. - You'd do the same for us. - What's up? - Why wasn't Mandy's car here last night? - Huh? - She wakes up in the morning and her gas is on empty. - What are you talking about? - You know what I'm talking about. Don't be dumb. - All right. Maybe I got a pack of cigarettes. - You better not take her car again, all right? - Fine. - I got you a job. - What? - 6:30 tomorrow. It's where I work. They need someone to do odd jobs. - Thanks, I guess. - Look, just --just be ready. [Music] - I think I might have made mistake by taking on logistics. - What's going on? - I feel like I'm fighting an uphill battle. Jack, the sales director, won't put in a realistic forecast and my boss won't support me. - That's not fair. Isn't there anything else you can do about it? - I've done everything I know to do. I hate having to fight like this. - I got those tickets to the play you've been wanting to see downtown. - When is it? I don't know if I can go. - Why not? - I was planning on working this weekend, and next weekend Mandy and Dustin are having their wedding reception here. - We need to make time for ourselves, too. I feel like we're just drifting apart. There's just so much going on with Cody and at work. [Music] - Hey. Come on. We gotta go to work. - I --i can't go. I don't feel good. - What do you mean you don't feel good? What, have you been out here all night? - Yeah. I was fishing. - You were fishing all night? - Yeah. - Listen, just get your clothes on. I'll wait for ten more minutes, all right? - I'm not going. I don't feel good. I already told you. - Hey, I went through a lot to get you this job. You could at least show up for the first day. - It's not my problem. I didn't ask you to get me the job. And I don't need your help. - This is your problem. All right? I'm not putting up with this anymore. - Deal with it. - Deal with it? - Yeah. - Why don't you find another place to stay? I'm doing a favor, you staying at my house, finding you a job! - I don't like living with you anyway. [Birds chirping] - Hey, I asked you to get these hot dogs on like ten minutes ago. What are you doing? - Oh. [Music] - No wonder you're acting like an idiot. - What do you want me to do? - They're hot dogs, ok? Just don't burn them. - Just get out of here. - Are you going to be ok? - Just give me --leave me alone. Get out of here. - Hey, Zac, get me a beer? - You know there's no alcohol at this reception, right? - I know you'll find a way. Just get me a beer. - All right. Use this glass, and I'll hide the evidence when you're done. - All right. Thank you. - So how's living with Dustin and Mandy going? - Uh, all right. Gotta find another place to crash now though. - Yeah. I would too, before their second kid arrives. - Yeah -- - Cody, watch out! [Table crashes to the ground] - Hey, whoa! What are you doing? - Uh -- - come on. I asked you to do the hot dogs. Look, you're making a scene, dude. Just get out of here. - It's not my fault! - Will you get out of here? [Music] [Spoon clinks on glass repeatedly] - Thank you. I have known Dustin ever since middle school. He used to hang around me so he cool and get girls like I would. [Laughing] And it looks like it worked because now he's a married man. I'd like to offer a toast to the happy couple. Long life, health and happiness. [Glasses clank together] [Spoon clinks on glass] - Mandy has been my best friend since grade school. She has always been there for me, and I'm so happy for her and Dustin. Cheers! - [All) Cheers! [Glasses clink together] - Can I get a smile from the happy couple? [Music] - What are you doing? - I'm resting! - This is your brother's wedding. You're embarrassing him. - What you really mean is I'm embarrassing you. - Why are you acting like that? Why can't you just enjoy yourself? - I was enjoying myself. As a matter of fact, I was enjoying myself so much it wore me out. - Stop it. Settle down right now. - Don't try to control me like you control Dustin. - What are you talking about? - I know you bribed Dustin marry Mandy. That's pathetic! - I can't believe you said that. - Well, it's true. Leave me alone. - I'm sorry you heard that. I was just trying to get Dustin to do the right thing. That's all. - We're done. Did you seriously just marry me for money? - Look, we got married, all right? You wanted to get married and we got married. - Do you even want to be married to me? - If I didn't to be married to you, I wouldn't have just done all that, all right? - You are ridiculous! [Music] - What's wrong? - I'm fine, mom, ok? I'm fine. - Here's your money. Plus a little extra. Congratulations. - Thanks. Hey, mom. Cody has got to go. We can't have him in the house anymore. - Can you give me a couple weeks? - I guess so, but hurry up. Mandy doesn't want him there. And you know what? I can't blame her. Hey, he's got to get out of here. [Music] - I'm writing you as a good performer this year. - That's lower than the excellent from last year. - The inventory levels have gone up the past three months during your watch. - I warned you this would happen if a realistic billed forecast wasn't put into the system. - Why didn't you get them reduced then? - Did you forget? Sales is the one who determines the forecast level. We just order based on what they put into the system. - You need work with the team to get the levels down. You know that. - Only my individual performance review is based on absolute levels of inventory. Why is that? - Because you're the logistics manager. You're the one responsible for the level of inventory. - Great. - This isn't the end of the world, you know? Just come up with a game plan to reduce it. I'll be able to write you excellent again just like all the other years. - You know what? I think today would be a good day to quit. - What? You can't be serious. - Why not? I'm tired of being the scapegoat for sales. I don't need this aggravation. - Ah. Let's end our discussion. You go back to your office and cool down. I'm sure we can work through this without you quitting, can't we? Just go back to your office and settle down! We can finish your performance reviewing some other -- [music] - What are you doing? - I give up. I'm just going to start feeding the squirrels. - Why? - I'm just done with it. It's not worth it. Honey, what's wrong? What's wrong? - I had my performance review today. It didn't go well. I might quit my job. Are you really ok if I don't work any longer? - You shouldn't have brought all this on yourself. You already had a great job. You really need to think it through though because you might regret quitting. [Crickets chirping] - You know, those pills aren't going to help you, right? - You wouldn't understand. - You're not the only kid who had problems growing up. - Did your mom abandon you? - No. But I didn't get to see my dad. So I kind of understand. - No, you don't. Every time I had a problem my mom couldn't cope with, he she just shipped me away. She put me in all those programs because she couldn't deal with me. - She always brought you back, didn't she? What? - I don't know. Maybe these pills are getting to my head. Right before I gotta rested, I could have swore there was someone in the car with me. I was starting to nod off. Then a voice came over me saying, wake up! And I look over and there was no one there. It was the strangest thing. - My grandma would say maybe it was god sending you an angel, to wake you up, helping you before it was too late. I went to church with my grandma on Sunday. A lot of things the pastor said really made me think. [Music] - Why don't you take a seat? - I don't want to sit down. - Are you sure this is what you want to do? - Yes. I've thought about it and I decided it's just not worth it anymore. - Uh, you know, we could go back to the way things were. You could just handle the finance area. - That's not what I want. - I could probably even arrange to keep your salary at the higher level. You'd just have to give up your new office. - No. I'm tired of fighting. I'm leaving. [Pencil snaps] - Hi, Pam. - Hi. - You look tired. Long day? - Yeah, you could say that. - Hmm, what's going on? - Cody is gone. No one has seen him since the wedding reception. - Oh. I'm so sorry. Does Alan know? - No. I don't want to tell him. He doesn't really have good feelings towards Cody. I'm just so upset. Do you think we can go in the prayer room afterwards and pray? - Absolutely. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Oh, I quit my job today. I'm just so angry. - I understand. - I've tried to follow god my entire life. I haven't been perfect, but I've tried. I went to a Christian college. The guy I met there ends up being unfaithful. Then I have these two children. One of them is doing who knows what. The other one I have to bribe to get married. Things are falling apart at work. I quit my job today. - Oh, Pam! - And Alan is upset with me. - It's ok to be honest with god. He knows how you feel. - What does he want me to do? Does he want me to give up? - Of course not, Pam. - You know what? I'm tired of reading my Bible. I'm sick of praying. God isn't answering my prayers! - But this is the time to remember the verses that he said he gave you. Those will be your comfort now. - I don't care about that. I'm tired of being in pain. [Sobbing] - Oh, heavenly father, we just come to you today. We just ask that you pour out your mercies on Pam. [Music] [Garage door slides open] [Car starts] [Car stalls] [Car door slams closed] [Music] [Front door opens and closes] [Music] [Cocks shotgun] [Music] - I'm not sure if anybody's in the house. Let me check. [Music] - Yes. Definitely. Someone's in there. - Who are you? Hey? Who are you? What are you doing in my house? All right. All right. Yes, I went in the house. It's my house. I was in the army for 20 years. I'm not going to let some punk stay in my house like that! Oh. Ok. I'll wait for the officer in my car. - Hi. - Hello, officer. - Did you call, sir? - Yes, sir. - Ok. You're the homeowner, correct? - Yes. There's a man in my house. - Ok. Do you know him? - I do not know him. - Can you just wait here, please? I'm going to go into the house. - Ok. Thank you. [Music] Hey, hey. Wake up. Turn around. Roll around. Get your arms behind your back for me. - What's going on? - There you go. Put your palms together. [Handcuffs click closed] - Let's go outside and talk, ok? - Ok. - We'll just go out here and talk. Good. [Music] [Phone rings] - This call is from the Livingston county jail. If you do not wish to receive any calls from our facility, then call our office at 800-233 -- - hello. Hello? - Mom. - Cody? Is that you? - Yeah. Uh, I --I've been arrested. And I'm in jail. I've really messed up this time. - What happened? - I'm not sure of the charges yet, but they say that the bail is $100,000. - What did you do? - I broke into a house. I fell asleep. [Sobbing] - They found me with a shotgun. - A gun? You have a gun? - No. It wasn't mine. It was the homeowner's. [Sobbing] Mom, please don't cry. - Your time is up. You have 20 seconds before this call will be disconnected. - Mom? Mom? - What? - I'm really sorry. - I am, too. [Sobbing] [Music] - Oh dear lord, will you please forgive me for trying to take matters into my own hands? Help me to turn Cody completely over to you. Help me to trust you more. [Sobbing] [Music] - Hey. What's wrong? [Sobbing] I know something is wrong. - It's --it's Cody. - What? What's happened? - He's been arrested. He's in jail. [Sobbing] - Will you forgive me? - What? - I'm sorry. - What for? - For not being honest with you. For not telling you everything about what was going on with Cody. Will you forgive me? - Oh honey, of course I will. [Sobbing] - Hey. I love you. And I always will. [Sobbing] [Music] - I think you need to share what's going on with Cody. - Cody has been arrested. [Women gasp] - Is he ok? - You know what? It's really hard for me to talk about the details. It just it seems so hopeless. [Sobbing] - It's all right, Pam. - Mandy, what's wrong? - It's Austin. He's really sick. - Oh, the baby. - What's going on? - He's had a fever for a couple of days and I don't know what happened. It spiked. The doctor had given him medicine but they said they're doing tests tomorrow if it doesn't go down, and I don't know what to do. - Where is he? - He's with Dustin. I knew you all were meeting today so -- - yeah. - Would you pray for him? - Mandy, you're always welcome here. - What's wrong with you? - Cody has been arrested. I didn't tell you because I knew that you and Dustin were so angry with me. - Is everything ok? - No. No, it's not. Everything is a mess. - Don't worry. God's going to help you through it. - You hate me. - I don't hate you. You're not perfect. You're human. - I'm sorry I hurt you. I'm sorry that I tried to bribe Dustin. I'm sorry about Austin. Can you forgive me? [Sobbing] - Yeah. I love you. [Sobbing] - Oh, thank you. - Ladies, let's pray. - Oh father god, Pam's heart is so broken right now, father. So we ask you to look down on her. Comfort her. Give her that peace and understanding. And father, be with her Cody. Touch him, father. Whisper into his ear right now. Tell him that it's --it's not too late. Tell him he can still come to you. [Music] - Can you show me that verse that one chaplain was talking about? - You mean the one where it says god will forgive us our sins? - Yeah. - Yeah. Let me see if I can find it. - It was in John, I think. Something like god will forgive us and clean us if we believe. - 1 John 1:9, if we confess our sins he's faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. - Yeah, that's it. Are you a Christian? - No. - How did you know the verse? - Sunday school. [Music] - Hey, do you think you could help us with this stuff? - No. [Music] - He's faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us. [Music] - God, I know I can't take away everything I've done. I know I've sinned a lot. But I can't do this anymore without your help. Please save me. And show me the way. I really need you. [Music] [Music] [Soft sobs] - Honey? [Music] - Hi, Pam. Hi, Alan. How you doing tonight? - Good. How are you? - Good to see you. What's going on? Oh. What's this? This is fantastic! Pam, would you care if I shared this in church tonight? - You know what? It's too soon. - Ok. Listen, when you're ready let me know, all right. - Ok. - Thanks. Thanks for sharing it with me. [Music] - I thought it would be a good thing tonight to take a little time for testimonies. Does anybody have anything they'd like to share? [Music] - Pam has received a letter from Cody, her son. And she has given me permission to read it tonight. Dear mom and Alan, this might sound like a lie, but I've decided to change my life around. I accepted Jesus into my heart, and I pray for his guidance often. I feel stupid for waiting until now, but I finally feel at peace with myself. And for the first time in my life, I am sure I will go to heaven. I want to thank you for all your support and help in my life. [Applause] I really and truly do plan to change 100% for myself and also for you. Thanks for not giving up on me. I love you very much. Please pray for me. Love, Cody.
