MEANWHILE, MEDI-CORPS WILL HAVE WORKED OUT A DEAL WITH THE FDA, WHO, IN TURN, AUTHORIZE A CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT, COSTING OUR REPENTANT PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY FAR LESS THAN PAYING OUT INDIVIDUAL FAMILIES FOR THEIR LOSSES. AND AT THE SAME TIME, MEDI-CORPS HAS THE HARVARD GEEK SQUAD LOCKED IN A DUNGEON SOMEWHERE UNTIL THEY CAN WHIP UP A NEW FORMULA THAT DOESN'TKILL PATIENTS. AND AT THIS POINT, PRICES GO UP. WAY UP. AND YOU KNOW WHO GETS RICH? PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE WAS SCARED. NOW, ARE WE SCARED? No, Miranda, we're not scared. I DIDN'T THINK SO. HEY. OH, REALLY?
