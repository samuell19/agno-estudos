Has our town become so heartless? Are rich men of this country free to wreck other lives? I have prayed to every God in this town They have all abandoned us You are our final hope What's his name? One who raped is Munna Deivam came in to quash this case for money Hey, who here is Deivam? Who is Deivam, here? Tell me I said, who here is Deivam? Here, I am Kaali Everything's up for sale Has made you think you can sell women's honour Right? You'll try minting money out of ruined lives Did you think we will look the other way? What was that? Something about brats going mad over lust and anger So, we the commoners are at the mercy of their madness? Kangaroo courts are illegal And you had the cheek to solicit an Inspector Listen... You will make him surrender in the court of law, or you will surrender to death Because ...this land belongs to the Sons of Kannagi (a demi-god) not to the Sons of Kaantha Who is Kaantha? You, dear daughter of a harlot! Go on now I'm dying here and... ...you are off to see other men. curse you, Vixen Shut up Oh... Kaantha! Such nerve to insult you... to your face Yes! How dare he insults you, Sir? Shut up. He only said it once. You all keep repeating it. What do we do now, Deivam? Your father is not around Why do we need him? Can I not kill? When is coming to the court tomorrow? Did I not tell you Madani? Do you know who he has told off? He's confronted the son of Ganesan I fear for what might happen next All your love has spoiled him Vetri, why should we get into trouble for others? How can you say that? This wasn't other's trouble This was our trouble, Sister You all feared I might hurt him for what he did to Thamizh Now, the brute has messed up her life Had I knew of this back then, we could have saved that girl She got into trouble for our Thamizh, Sister So callous we don't want to help the people who tried helping us Has our education pushed us into indifference? The men who go along with injustice, or shrink away, should be rid of this place A spear held in self-defense is not thuggery, Sister Men who derive sadistic pleasure, should be shown pain Battle injuries are nothing new to us, Sister When I saw her parents sobbing helplessly, I thought of... We get degrees, upgrade our lifestyle, only to live in insecurity? I cannot live with such indignity Spared him, out of respect for you Let's see whether your Police and Law can handle this If, he gets away in court tomorrow, Madurai will witness unexpected things Vetri...

The men who raised my son want to kill you Can you imagine my rage? I've killed men who barely confronted my son, but I'm taking a pause with you Why? Your death wouldn't just be an incident, it'll become history in Madurai The Gods will shudder Who do you think my son was? My identity. My authority. I lost my dignity begging for him Gave up this district That's the guy you murdered, in broad daylight How should I slaughter you? All this while, I was looking at his bloodstained shirt It wasn't anger, you killed out of rage Where you killed my son, I'll sever your head in the same place Right on the 16th day As an offering to my son Survival is the ultimate stuggle in this world "Why did I kill Ganesan's son?" Will be your regret every day I'll make sure of it You can leave now Take him away Can we file case? After I've killed him, you can dump it on me I have nothing to live for Sir, he's refusing to file case What do we do now? Forget that idiot We showed our loyalty Can't be listening to him anymore We'll end up paying for it Doesn't matter if he is unwilling... All we need is a case MKS has already filed one We'll produce him in court Then its their tussle Under the jurisdiction of Madurai Anna Nagar Police Station, with regards to the Maatuthavani Double Murder Case, the accused Vetri from Sellur who is charged under IPC Section 302, should be in custody in Madurai Central Jail for 15 days, should be produced here for re-investigation on 23rd of next month. (Court Order Concludes) Sir, even Ganesan did not file case, why did you? We might get into trouble, Sir He can spare him for any number of days I cannot He killed my only son I can't be patient any longer I don't care what you would do, I want him dead in 10 minutes An eye for an eye Here... This is why we warned you all the time Did we make you a lawyer, to see you soaked in blood? Pechi... Mapla... Our Sellur Ranjith and Zinda are in there They'll look after you I have given them dresses for you Get rid of this shirt first Devoid of love, the world never revolves, True Blood never dissolves. Devoid of love, the world never revolves, True Blood never dissolves. The sea never leaves the shore, Kin clings to you like an endearing lore. Without light, shadows can't exit, Without Kin, life can't exist Blood heals, like a boon, surreal. Blood heals, like a boon, surreal. Sisters being affectionate is quite common They are your blood But their husbands caring for you... You are lucky But you have earned the enemity of men who kill for business, and the men whose business is killing It wouldn't go away easily, brother Be alert here Why did you send men to kill him? Why the hell am I here for? Brother... He's slaughtered my son, how can I be passive? I cannot I'll keep sending in men, till he is killed I miss my son, brother I see You cannot live without him If you miss him so much, then go meet him Hubby, Oh No... Come see this! Please some one come here Someone's stabbed here - Hubby, come soon - Pechi, what happened? Pechi, What's wrong? What happened brother? (Cacophony) Who is he? Who is he bleeding here? Take a closer look You'll soon need posters for your brother Madam, because he tried to kill your brother, you lot have killed MKS overnight, displaying his body on your doorstep How dare you? What? He tried to kill my brother? What else did you expect for murdering his son? Sir, don't you know who did it? Of course I know But what can I do? Your Machinan has touched the untouchable, Did the unspeakable The worst is yet to come Brace for it We warned him fearing exactly these sort of consequences He did not pay heed Now we all have lost our peace, including him The Police has started to meddle now Sister, can we all ask Ganesan's forgiveness? Try to make peace Why should we meet him? Yes, I agree brother We don't need to beg him Listen brother, we need to do save Vetri from any harm This is not the way to do it This temperament is doing us no good At least now listen to us Don't we want Vetri to be free? Where is his home brother? I'm not a noble man to forgive when asked for it You are here fearing you would lose him But I have lost my son Whose pain is greater? Mine or yours? My son is no more I couldn't care less for your brother Oh Lord... We told you so To beg this forgiveness from a fiend... We tried making peace but he is full of rage Jail is safer for our brother now He can't harm him for a while Look there, idiot He's out Why is here, sister? I'm thinking the same How did you get out before got bail? After killing the guy who filed the case, Kodumbavi Ganesan bailed Vetri Please listen to us this time, Mapla He wants revenge for his son You leave Madurai for a while My brother is in Kodaikanal, you can go there We'll do our best to make peace So it's for your best that you leave Madurai Why should I leave, Mama? The 16 day deadline is for him. Not me. Say it sister and I'll have his head at your feet How many can you kill? How many can you kill? You'll kill him today Tomorrow you'll kill his brother And go on a killing spree? Is this why we educated you? They have killed a man on our doorstep, and warned us off You are being childish Mapla, are you more hot-headed than us? Born in the lineage of warriors, sporting a mustache, why do you think I work in a Public Toilet? I'd visit my father in jail for 15 years, in my childhood I don't wish that for my son But you don't seem to care Don't you know better? So you want me to run away? Not run away Be tactful I don't know whether you reciprocate our love, but think of your sisters who raised you as a son if you still don't want to heed us, and go your own way, then so be it We are done explaining Vetri... Thought I kept hunger away from you, but seems like I have kept fear away too Mapla, Listen to their goodwill Why don't you leave this place? What do you think, brother? Ok Vetri Listen to your loved ones - Kaalai Sir - Huh? Knowing that we would kill him, they have sent him to Kodaikanal Kodaikanal? I don't care if he hides in the hills, He should be back before the 16th day The heart desires to narrate (to you) The heart desires to berate (you) Desire to tell, retell to the heart's fill A glance to keep still, tongue draws a nil Nights to kill, Words to distill where words fail, eyes do refill (Have you seen him?)

My mother... Oh my mother... Mama, -Yep - You are combative with everyone But you are unassuming with my sister Why Mama? I'll confess, why not? When my brother was in his 20s, he lost both his kidneys, my father pleaded many men, but they turned him away with disdain I donated one of mine, to save my brother Knowing this people were reluctant to accept me as a groom But when your sister came to know that, she was stubborn on marrying me I'll love her to my grave You raised us like parents Now we have families of our own, but you have left us Shouldn't spare...
