(birds singing) (hammering) (leaves rustling) (hammering) (calm music) - Lily. (indistinct TV voice) - [Reporter] The highest casualty rate in the British forces. More than 1 in 10 killed or wounded. They called it the Heart of Darkness. Taliban country along the river... (birds singing) - Dad was wondering if you were gonna help while you're back. - Did he ask that or are you? - I just thought he'd appreciate the gesture that you could try working together again. - Smoking now? (coughs) (laughs) (calm music) - [Sue] Say hello to him from me. (knocking on door) - Where is he? - He said to give you this. What does it mean? (calm music) - Sam? Sam! Did you think about me? - All the time. - Liar. (calm music) (upbeat music) - What is it? (upbeat music) - (muffled voice) Sam! Sam! Sam? Hey. What's wrong? - Are you happy? - What? - With me. What I do. - Of course I am. I couldn't be more proud. - I lost a mate a few weeks ago. Adam, a lad from Stoke. We were on patrol and we started taking fire. So we took cover in a drainage ditch. This boy appeared out of nowhere, couldn't have been more than about 10. There was a moment when we just stared at each other. And then he fired. Adam returned and I watched this boy's chest explode. Surrounded by this red mist. And then he dropped. But so did Adam. I tried calling for help. I tried to apply some pressure. I'm not sure I can do it anymore. (heavy breathing) - You looking for something? - No. - You're Brookwell's lad. The soldier. Must be an interesting profession, shooting ragheads out in the desert. Suppose you do a lot poking around out there, snooping around, sniffing out muzzies in whatever holes they've crawled into but it doesn't work like that back here. You ought to remember that. The road is that way. - Got some post for you. (discordant music) - Do you think he's killed anyone? Because it's likely, isn't it? I mean that's what they do. - Most combat happens from a distance. - Did he tell you that? - I read it. - It would change you though, wouldn't it? - What? - Killing someone. (sombre music) (fire crackling) - That heifer's due tonight. I want you checking her every 20 minutes. (cows mooing) - Let's do something. - I have to work. - All day? Other thing? What other thing? Tell me! I wish you didn't have to go back. I worry. - You shouldn't. I should go back. - Not yet. Stay a bit longer. Please? - [Brookwell] Don't you turn your back on me. If you don't give a damn then what are you doing back here? I didn't ask for your help! - [Sam] I'm sorry. - [Brookwell] You're not sorry. You know what your problem is? You're selfish. That's right, go on. Back to the army. - Sam, stop. He doesn't mean it. - Sam. Sam, wait! Talk to me! - Get off. (knocks) (door opens) (discordant music) - You okay? - A nice little project for me, you know, something to keep me busy. Never thought it'd be this difficult. If I come and have a look at the options laid out before me here I can get some ideas, refocus and make some firm decisions. - Well I think we can help. Have a look at that. - Get the fuck out of here. - I suppose this is why people get designers in. - I'm really sorry, could you hold on for just one minute? What's going on? - I should have you arrested. - Sure, you call the police. - Stewart, you're needed back inside. - What's going on? - Harlequin Jones. - I'm really sorry about that, Mr. Jones. Is there something I could help you with? What did he want? - Wanted to replace this. - Do you think he did it? - What? Shot his wife? - Everyone says he did. - Don't you think he would've been locked up by now? - But she used his gun. - I doubt she had her own. (knocking on door) - So, when will they let you know? - Thank you. I'm not sure. Whenever they make a decision I suppose. - And they pay you for that, do they? Sitting around doing nothing? Now I know where my tax is going. I mean, shouldn't you be training or something? - He's on mid-tour leave. Everyone's entitled to some time off, especially after what he's done. - Where was it you were fighting again? - Nahre Saraj, North district, Helmand Province. - Afghanistan? - Yeah. Afghanistan. - [Sue] Shall we change the subject? - Why don't you tell us a bit about your work, Stew? What is it you were doing before us? Plastics, wasn't it? - Yeah, injection moulding. At the unit just outside of town. - Yeah, that's it. Make all sorts of interesting things out there, don't they? Really useful Stuff, bottle tops and... - Lily... - What about Harlequin Jones, Stew? What's going on between you two? - Lily. - He tried to get me locked up once. I like do a bit of shooting, you know lamping. At night mainly. Old Jonesey got it into his head that I'd been poaching. - Poaching what? - Deer. Lot of money in it if you can get rid of it. - [Lily] And did you? - What? - Poach his deer. - That bloke is a murderer, shot his wife. - [Lily] It was suicide. - What, with his gun in the forest he manages? (scoffs) Did I say something funny? - You think he shot her? - Yeah, I do. Yeah, well, I suppose it's no big deal for you, is it? Must happen a few times a day out there, all part of the job, the routine. (ominous music) - A brand new fitted kitchen and bathroom with double glazing. Living area there, bedroom one, and bedroom two. I have had a few inquiries already about the property, so if you are serious I'd encourage you to put a deposit down as soon as possible. I'll give you a few minutes to have a look around. - [Lily] Thank you. - How much is the deposit? - Not too much. Don't you like it? - Nah, it's great. - I don't want you to worry about it. I'll sort it, okay? Rachel said your barracks called yesterday, Sergeant something or other. - What did he want? - Didn't say. Just that he wanted to speak to you. - Let's go upstairs. (ominous music) - Ow, Sam, what are you doing? (knocking on door) (ominous music) - Shh! (knocking on door) (ominous music) Lily! (sobs) - Lil, let me explain. Lily, talk to me. - I have nothing to say to you. - Please, Lily... Let me in. (Lily sobs) When I got back from tour I wasn't feeling great. Trouble sleeping and having nightmares. So I went to see a doctor and he gave me some pills and they helped calm me down. But I still didn't feel right. When I came home I stopped taking them. Something about being here and being with you, Felt normal again. Like it used to. But I know that if I'm here and I'm with you I can get better. But I won't to go back there Lil. - [Lily] And if they find you? - They'll send me to a corrective training facility or lock me up. Please Lil. (calm music) - Where is he? - At home. - You tell him that the police had been up at the farm. They want to know why his unit is back in Afghanistan and he's not. - Hello, Harry. Is everything okay? - It was your Tim that filled his head full of this army nonsense. You tell him that if doesn't give himself in I'll come and get him myself. - [Sue] You have to go speak to them, Sam. Get this mess cleared up. They must have made a mistake or something. - [Stew] He's a runaway. Deserter. - No. No, you've got a responsibility. You can't just run away. What is wrong with you? - She asked you a question. What is wrong with you? Can't you hack it? Easier to run away? Easier being a coward? (discordant music) - Lily, wait. Lily! - Get off of me. - Lily, talk to me! - I can't even look at you right now. - I'm sorry. - What were you thinking? What the fuck do we do now? - I could go away. Wait for things to blow over. - That's your plan? Run away again? - I'm sorry. I'll think of something. I'll figure it out. (rain pattering) - We can clear it out. Bring some stuff in. It's a stupid idea, isn't it? - Maybe. I have slept in it. We could go and get some tools and my stuff from the farm. - It'll have to do. (birds singing) When you went to the doctor, did you tell him that you were unhappy? That you were thinking of leaving? - People don't like you talking like that. - But what if you want to leave? - I can't. I still have at least another year left before I can give any notice. - There must be someone we can talk to. - My commanding officer maybe. But he's not gonna waste any time with me. If I lay low for long enough, it'll all blow over. They're not gonna spend much time looking for one soldier like me. Not that I don't enjoy them, but maybe tomorrow we could have something more nourishing for dinner. (screams) - I'm gonna head to the shop. Do you want anything? (ominous music) (muffled voices) Sam? Didn't you hear me? (fire crackling) - I can't sleep. What if they find me? - I won't let them. Are these even gonna work? You know, I can just buy us food. - That's not the point. Here we go. Easy. (groaning) - Sam, could you help me with this? Sam? Can you help? Harlequin's been removing the snares. - How do you know it's Harlequin? - [Sam] I've been watching him. - What if he sees you? - He won't. (engine revving) (ominous music) (knocking on door) - Harlequin? Harlequin. (siren wailing) (ominous music) (dogs barking) - What are you doing? - Where's your phone? - It's at home. - At home? Are you sure? - Yes. - Good. Because they can track us with us. They can triangulate the signal or something, so. - Where are you going? - To check if they've gone. - Who? (ominous music) (gun firing) - Hello? (cow mooing) (ominous music) - [Stewart] You're fuckin' insane, Jones! (gun fires) - [Harlequin] I can see you, you bastard. Run you coward. I'll find you and I'll fucking kill you. (gun fires) (muffled voices) - [Man] Shoot! Shoot him now! Shoot! Shoot him now! (rain pattering) - Sam? Sam? Hey. Hey Sam. Hey. Sam, wake up. Hey. Hey, you okay? (kettle whistling) Maybe you should see someone. - Who? - I was thinking maybe we could go to a walk in, somewhere they won't recognise you. What are you doing? - I need to check something. - No, you need to rest. - Stop it. - I'll come with you. - Stay here. (ominous music) (wings flapping) - Where'd you get that? - [Sam] Here. - What? - You do it. - No. - Push the blade in there. - No, I won't. - Go on. - Please, Sam. I don't want to. Do it! - [Sue] Lily, it's me. The police have been around again. I know you're just trying to do what's right but let me help. Stewart's gone. He's taken off. I wish you'd come home. - Just seen the work van hidden in the woods. Apparently Stewart took off with it. - I saw him the other day. Snooping around Harlequin's lorry. - Doing what? - I don't know. - What were you doing there? - Snooping. How did you know about Stewart. You just said Stewart took off with the work van. How did you know? Lily, the phone. Burn it. (dogs barking) (ominous music) Move. They're back. Don't light any fires. (ominous music) - Open it. Venison. Consider it your last meal. Police came to see me. I didn't tell 'em. You should get that lad home before he comes to some harm. I want you out of this forest by morning. Both of you. (sombre music) - I found him. - Whose blood is that? - What is that? Where did you get it? When was he here? - An hour ago. We need to go away, go some place new and start over. - Let's go home. - I need to show you something. - I don't understand. Sam, we need to go home. - He moved it when I came to fetch you. - Sam, stop. - He moved it so now you wouldn't believe me. - Stop! There's nothing here. Listen to me! We have to go home. - No! You're wrong. You're wrong. He's here, he's in here! (growling) - You're still here. Come on. I'll take you home. - Get away from her. Lily, come here. - It's over, lad. - Lily. Lily, look at me. Ask him about Stewart. Ask him about the van. - I hid it. He's been using it to cart away deer. Caught him the other night. - I saw you. I dug it up. What have you done with him? - With who? - Stewart. - I fired a few shots at him, scared him off. - What about the bag? You moved it. - Bag of offal lad. He was cutting up a young doe when I found him. What I could butcher I kept, the rest I buried. (ominous music) - He's lying to us Lil. He's manipulating you, can't you see that? I saw you the other night out in the forest arguing and the gunshots. - To scare him off. - You're lying. - I'm no liar. - Shut up! - That's enough. Put it down! (ominous music) - Come on then. Please. Shoot me. - Sam. - Shoot me! - I'm going back to the lorry. If you're not there in 15 minutes, I'm fetching the police. - I won't do this with you anymore. I won't do this with you anymore. (sombre music) - Just you? Jump in. I'll move this stuff and we can get you home. (sombre music) - Right, all set?
