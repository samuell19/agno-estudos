CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY VIDMARK ENTERTAINMENT FEELINGS... I DON'T KNOW. EVERYTHING'S... EVERYTHING'S NORMAL. THEN, OUT OF NOWHERE, SUDDENLY THEY'RE TEARING AT ME. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE PAST OR THE FUTURE, HEAVEN OR HELL. SCARED? YEAH... I'M SCARED. SOMETHING'S HAPPENING, AGAIN, AND I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS OR WHO'S RESPONSIBLE. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE TRUTH? THE TRUTH'S ALL TWISTED. GO BACK TO WHAT? THINK ABOUT IT. WHAT WOULD IT REALLY BE LIKE TO GO BACK AND TO KNOW THE FUTURE? EVERYONE I GREW UP WITH, EVERYONE I KNEW, THEY'RE DEAD, OR IN SOME RETIREMENT HOME. I GO VISIT THEM. THE KIDS I GREW UP WITH DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO I AM. WHY SHOULD THEY? I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO I AM. THESE FEELINGS-- HOW LONG HAVE THEY BEEN GOING ON? I DON'T KNOW. THREE MONTHS. THAT WAS WHEN YOU LOST YOUR BUSINESS. WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH ANYTHING? NOW THE BANK WANTS TO FORECLOSE ON YOUR HOUSE. I TOLD THOSE GUYS I JUST NEED A LITTLE TIME, THAT'S ALL. HOW'S BENJAMIN? HOW IS HE, DAVID? HE MISSES HIS MOTHER. SCHOOL? HE'S DOING FINE. MISSED FIVE DAYS LAST MONTH. YOU SEEM TO KNOW ALL THE ANSWERS, DOCTOR! WHY BOTHER ASKING THE QUESTIONS? ALL I WANT TO KNOW IS WHAT'S GOING ON. YOU OWE ME THAT! NOTHING. NOTHING'S GOING ON. THESE HALLUCINATIONS COINCIDE WITH HIGH-STRESS INCIDENTS-- THE DEATH OF YOUR WIFE, COLLAPSE OF YOUR BUSINESS. A PERIOD OF REMORSE, OF INTROSPECTION, EVEN RESENTMENT IS INEVITABLE. YOU HAVE TO COME TO TERMS, TO ACCEPT WHAT'S HAPPENED. YOU HAVE TO MOVE ON. ARE YOU FINISHED? DAVID. DAVID! THE NAVY WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU'LL CONSIDER COMING BACK. THEY'LL CLEAR THE SLATE, TAKE CARE OF THE MORTGAGE, SETTLE THE BILLS. I HAVE TO ASK. THEY HAVE MY BLOOD. TELL THEM I'LL HANG ON TO MY SOUL. THIS IS 1-1-7 ALPHA. BEARING 2-9-0. DESCENDING. 0-0-0. OVER. THE STEALTH FIGHTER, GENTLEMEN-- 100 MILLION TAX DOLLARS A POP. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE PONIED UP FOR ONE REASON. IT WAS THE FUTURE. IT WAS INVINCIBLE AND INVISIBLE. ENABLE SYSTEMS. ALPHA ROMEO, THIS IS TEST CONTROL. SERIES 4-- NEST TO ROGUE BIRD. YOU ARE CLEAR TO CLOAK. DECODE. CHARLIE, ROMEO. COMMENCE. 3...2... 1... PEACEFUL, ISN'T IT? SHE'S UP THERE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN EARTH AND HEAVEN, AND WE CAN'T SEE HER, RIGHT? WHEN YOU APPROVED PHASE ONE OF THIS PROJECT, I TOLD YOU THAT SCIENTIFIC INNOVATION WAS CONSTANT COMPETITION. IF WE BUILD A BETTER MOUSE, SOMEBODY WILL BUILD A BETTER TRAP. SHOW THEM, HANK. TRANSPONDERS ARE ON. COMMENCING ULTRASOUND EMISSIONS... NOW. OVERLAY...ON. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? IT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU THINK IT IS, SIR-- OUR INVISIBLE AIRCRAFT. IT'S AN ACOUSTICAL TRACKING SYSTEM. WE PICKED IT UP FROM A DISEMPLOYED SOVIET PHYSICIST. SOLD IT TO US CHEAP. WE'RE FAILING, GENTLEMEN. RADAR STEALTH IS DEAD. THE TRUTH IS THAT IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SOMETHING INVISIBLE, YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT DISAPPEAR. YEAH! WAY TO CONNECT, BENNY! THAT'S A DOUBLE! LET'S GO! COME ON! THROW IT! SAFE! WHAT? ALL RIGHT. NICE HUSTLE, BEN. SAVE SOME FOR THE OPENING GAME. DAD! SORRY, COACH. I GOT TO GO. BE ON TIME SATURDAY, BENNY. REMEMBER, THIS IS OPENING GAME THIS WEEKEND. LET'S GO. NEXT BATTER. COME ON, JOEY! YOU'RE UP! HEADS UP, GUYS. COME ON. LOOK ALIVE. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. SO MARK SAYS TERMINATOR KILLS PREDATOR, BUT I SAY NO WAY. PREDATOR'S COOL, RIGHT? THEN PAUL GOES, "NO. ROBOCOP KILLS THEM BOTH." WHAT DO YOU SAY? ABOUT WHAT? DAD! TERMINATOR AND PREDATOR AGAINST ROBOCOP. WHO WINS? I DON'T KNOW-- SUPERMAN. SUPERMAN? COME ON, DAD. HE'S A WIMP. SUPERMAN'S NOT A WIMP. THAT'S THE MAN OF STEEL. YEAH, WELL, ADAMANTIUM'S HARDER THAN STEEL. THAT'S WHY SUPERMAN RETIRED. ADA WHAT? ADAMANTIUM-- HARDEST METAL ON EARTH. LOOK, I GOT SOME. TRADED MY LUNCH FOR IT. SEE? YOU CAN'T BREAK IT. DON'T DO THAT. LET ME SEE THAT. THIS IS WHAT PUT SUPERMAN OUT OF BUSINESS? YEP. THINK IT'LL GO GOOD ON OLD BLUE? WELL, WE'LL GIVE IT A SHOT. REALLY? COOL! IT'S STILL ANOTHER SUNNY DAY IN SUNNY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ON 102.2 FM HERE IN SANTA PAULA. IT'S MAY 3, 1993, AND THE SECOND HAND IS TICKING ON TOWARDS 5:03 IN THE AFTERNOON. COMING UP, WE HAVE ANOTHER UNINTERRUPTED HOUR-- I'M ALREADY FAST AS TOMMY. MAYBE FASTER. BUT HE'S GOT BETTER STUFF. I GET MY CURVE BALL GOING, I KNOW I'LL START. COACH SAID SO. DON'T THROW THE BALL IN THE HOUSE. WOULDN'T THAT BE COOL-- ME WINNING THE OPENING GAME? I'LL HELP YOU, LATER! WHEN? THE GAME'S ON SATURDAY, AND I REALLY WANT TO-- I TOLD YOU NOT TO DO THAT! I'M WORKING! NOTHING'S BROKEN. GOOD. NOW, TAKE IT OUTSIDE, ALL RIGHT? WILL YOU COME WITH ME? NOT RIGHT NOW. BUT THE CURVE. YOU ALWAYS SAY-- DAMN IT! SORRY, DAD. THE CURVE. THE CURVE. YOU WANT TO SEE THE CURVE? YEAH. ALL RIGHT. I'LL SHOW YOU THE CURVE. REMEMBER, IT'S JUST A SWING OF THE ARM DOES IT, ALL RIGHT? ELBOW HIGH, WRIST RELAXED, JUST LIKE THAT. YOU SEE IT? KIND OF. GET YOUR BAT. SOME GUYS TRY AND FORCE IT WITH THE WRIST, BUT YOU CAN'T. WATCH THE BALL. SEE THE ACTION? YEAH! GIVE ME ANOTHER. HERE WE GO. LAST STRIKE. BOTTOM OF THE NINTH. BASES LOADED. CHECKS HIS MAN ON FIRST. THE PITCH. OH, AND HE'S OUT OF THERE! LUCKY CATCH. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH A LITTLE LUCK. COME ON, DAD. THROW ME ANOTHER. YOU GO ON OUTSIDE AND PRACTICE. I NEED SOMEONE TO CATCH THE BALL. GO ON. I'LL PLAY CATCH WITH YOU AFTER DINNER. O.K. AFTER DINNER. 1943, THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT. PROFESSOR JAMES LONGSTREET'S BABY-STEP ATTEMPTS TO CLOAK A U.S. NAVY DESTROYER FROM ENEMY RADAR. INSTEAD, THE ENTIRE SHIP VANISHES FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH FOR ALMOST ONE HOUR-- DISAPPEARS, GENTLEMEN. THE SAME YEAR BERLIN SCIENTIST FRIEDREICH MAILER, MY FATHER, INITIATES RADAR-JAMMING RESEARCH TO ASSIST IN DAYLIGHT BOMBING RAIDS. MARGINAL SUCCESS, ALTHOUGH ONE PROTOTYPE AIRCRAFT IS RUMORED TO HAVE ACHIEVED INVISIBILITY. 1984, NEVADA, SHORTLY AFTER MY FATHER'S DEATH, LONGSTREET INCORPORATES MAILER'S RESEARCH IN HIS OWN ENDEAVORS TO GENERATE AN ELECTROMAGNETIC MISSILE SHIELD OVER A SMALL TOWN NEAR A MILITARY BASE. THIS TIME, AN ENTIRE TOWN IS GONE FOR NEARLY ONE DAY. ANALYSES WERE DEBATED, REPORTS WRITTEN, FILED... FORGOTTEN. MAILER AND LONGSTREET'S RESEARCH WAS WRITTEN OFF AS FREAKISH ACTS OF NATURE UNTIL NOW. GENTLEMEN, FROM THE ASHES OF THESE MISFIRES, I AM HERE TO TELL YOU WILL RISE A TECHNOLOGY, A TOOL, A WEAPON THAT WILL BURN MOST BRIGHTLY IN THIS COUNTRY'S ARSENAL. FOLLOW ME... AND I WILL SHOW YOU THE FUTURE. IMAGINE BEING ABLE TO MOVE AN OBJECT FROM POINT A TO POINT B QUICKLY, SILENTLY, INVISIBLY. IMAGINE INSTANTANEOUS DEPLOYMENT WITH UNLIMITED RANGE. IMAGINE OMNIPRESENCE. IMAGINE NO MORE, GENTLEMEN, FOR I GIVE YOU SUPER STEALTH. THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT-- PERFECTED AT LAST. [SIZZLING] NEARING CRITICAL SPECTRUM. DAD! DAD, WHAT'S HAPPENING? WHAT'S GOING ON? GO TO YOUR ROOM. PLEASE. GO! NOT BAD, SIR. NOT BAD AT ALL. IT GETS EVEN BETTER. SUPER STEALTH IS THE WEAPON THAT WILL ENABLE US TO SEIZE THIS MOMENT OF DETENTE AND-- WHAT ABOUT HUMAN PAIN AND MISERY? WHAT ABOUT THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT, CHANGED INSTANTANEOUSLY? PROFESSOR LONGSTREET. THIS TECHNOLOGY IS YOUR VISION REALIZED. WE'VE DISCUSSED ITS POTENTIAL. [LONGSTREET] YES, BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED. YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR. THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT-- THAT SHIP DIDN'T DISAPPEAR INTO SOME DIMENSIONAL WAITING ROOM. WE CUT A HOLE THROUGH 40 YEARS OF TIME AND ALMOST SHATTERED THE CONTINUUM. BUT WE'VE REFINED THE PROCESS SO TIME ISN'T A VARIABLE. POTENTIAL FOR ERRORS IS VIRTUALLY NIL. TELL THEM ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO WENT THROUGH THE VORTEX. THE YOUNG MEN'S BODIES MELTED INTO THE HULL OF THAT SHIP. ONLY ONE MAN TRAVELED SUCCESSFULLY THROUGH THE VORTEX. HIS UNIQUE METABOLISM CREATED HIS OWN INDIVIDUAL CONTINUUM. THESE EXPERIMENTS ARE DESTABILIZING HIS DNA, LITERALLY TEARING HIM APART. IT MUST END NOW. THE INTRICATE WEAVE OF TIME IS NOT OURS TO UNRAVEL. WE'LL RECONVENE TOMORROW AT 0800 HOURS. YOU'LL HAVE OUR DECISION THEN. THANK YOU, PROFESSOR. YOU SWORE TO ME THEORETICAL RESEARCH STRICTLY. YOU OPENED PANDORA'S BOX, JAMES. THIS IS WHAT CAME OUT. ARROGANCE AND AMBITION-- IT'S A DANGEROUS MIX. FLY IN THE OINTMENT. YES, SIR. WELL, WHATEVER HAPPENS, SIR, IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE WORKING FOR YOU. GRATITUDE IS THE DISEASE OF DOGS. NIETZSCHE. NO. STALIN. [TELEPHONE RINGING] [RING] YEAH. DAVID. YOU SON OF A BITCH. YOU LIED TO ME. I DIDN'T KNOW THE EXTENT OF IT, HONESTLY. THEY'RE FURTHER ALONG THAN I THOUGHT. DANGEROUSLY SO. NO SHIT. YOU LISTEN TO ME. I'M GETTING THE HELL AWAY FROM YOU AND WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING. I NEED TO TALK TO YOU. YOU'VE GOT TO LISTEN TO ME. FORGET IT. NOT THIS TIME. YOU'RE NOT DRAGGING ME IN AGAIN. GO FIND SOMEONE ELSE. OH, BENNY. BENNY! WHERE YOU DRIVING TO, KID? NOWHERE. CAN I GET IN? ARE YOU DYING, LIKE MOM? NO. NO, I'M NOT DYING. WELL, SOMETHING HAPPENED, SON. IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN, BUT IT'S HURTING ME. IF I CAN GET AWAY FROM HERE, FROM THIS PLACE, MAYBE IT WILL STOP HURTING, THAT'S ALL. CAN I COME? OF COURSE YOU CAN. WHERE ARE WE GOING, DAD? I DON'T KNOW YET, SON. LOOK, I KNOW IT'S BEEN TOUGH. I KNOW YOU MISS YOUR MOM. I MISS HER, TOO. BUT YOU AND ME TOGETHER, WE'RE A TEAM, RIGHT? SOMETIMES I DON'T GET TO SPEND AS MUCH TIME WITH YOU AS I'D LIKE. AS LONG AS YOU AND I STICK TOGETHER, IT'LL GET BETTER, I PROMISE. NO MATTER WHERE WE GO, IT'LL GET BETTER. I KNOW WHAT WE COULD DO. WE'LL FIX OLD BLUE. THIS PIECE GOES HERE WHEN WE'RE DONE, AND WE'LL DRIVE SOMEPLACE WHERE YOU WON'T GET SICK ANYMORE. THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. WE BETTER GO INSIDE AND PACK. WE GOT TO GET GOING. O.K. COULD WE WAIT HERE A MINUTE, DAD? YOU BET WE COULD. WHAT'S THE FLIGHT PLAN? IT'S A ROUTINE SQUADRON REASSIGNMENT. NORTH ATLANTIC ROUTE TO WIESBADEN, GERMANY, NUKE PAYLOAD, ONE PILOT, UNINFORMED OF OUR PLANS. I'M AWARE OF THAT. THE DNA TESTING'S INCOMPLETE. WE HAVE YET TO DETERMINE HUMAN RESISTANCE-- I'M AWARE OF THAT! LOOK AROUND YOU, HANK. LOOK AT THE SCALE OF WHAT WE HAVE PUT TOGETHER ON A SLUSH FUND SHOESTRING. SUPER STEALTH IS TOO IMPORTANT TO BE HAMSTRUNG BY POLITICAL INDIFFERENCE. MY FATHER NEVER LET IDEOLOGY INTERFERE WITH HIS RESEARCH, NEVER LET RED TAPE STRANGLE HIS SCIENCE, AND I INTEND TO ABIDE BY THAT LEGACY. WHEN THAT PLANE DISAPPEARS OVER NEWFOUNDLAND AND INSTANTANEOUSLY REAPPEARS OVER WIESBADEN, WE WILL BE VINDICATED, AND NO ONE WILL WANT TO PULL THE PLUG. NOW, NO MIDDLE GROUND. YOU'RE IN, OR YOU'RE OUT. I'M IN, SIR. YOU CAN COUNT ON ME. GOOD. ...TO THE LEFT. THERE SHE IS. TARGET. LOCKED. LOCATION? NORTHEASTERN ZONE APPROACHING NEWFOUNDLAND. BRING UP THE NORAD STATUS MAP.

CONSIDER YOURSELF DELIVERED. HE'S OUT THERE. [HELICOPTER PASSES] STRENGTH. SECURITY. SUPREMACY. POWER. PRODUCTIVITY. PERPETUITY. HERDEG... DAVID HERDEG? YES. HEALTH. HYGIENE. HAPPINESS. PROCREATE. EDUCATE. REMEMBER PHILADELPHIA? LONGSTREET? AMAZING. 50 YEARS HAVE BEEN VERY KIND TO YOU, DAVID... OR ELSE INCREDIBLY CRUEL. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE A PART OF THIS. BODY, MIND, AND SOUL, I'M AFRAID. 50 YEARS. WE WERE ALL SO YOUNG. THERE WAS HOPE... SUCH FAITH IN OUR CAUSE, ENDLESS STRENGTH TO FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT. I KNOW. I WAS THERE. UNTIL '43, MAY 4th. I DISAPPEARED YOUR SHIP, AND YOU NEVER CAME BACK. THERE WERE STORIES YOU'D GONE FORWARD IN TIME. 24 HOURS LATER, IT DIDN'T MATTER. GO ON. 5th OF MAY, THE PHOENIX FLEW... DROPPED HER BOMBS ON WASHINGTON, D.C. 15 MILLION PEOPLE GONE. TOOK ME 20 YEARS TO FIGURE IT OUT-- WHY THE PHOENIX NEVER FLEW AGAIN, WHERE IT CAME FROM, AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DAMN THING. THEN ONE OF OUR OPERATIVES FOUND THIS. MY GOD, IT'S A STEALTH. NUCLEAR-ARMED. THEN IT ALL FELL TOGETHER. THE DOUBTS I HAD ABOUT YOU AND THE DAMN PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT BECAME NIGHTMARES. WE DID CUT A HOLE IN TIME. THE SAME WAY WE SENT YOU FORWARD FROM '43, THAT PLANE GOT SUCKED BACK THERE, LANDED IN THE HEART OF NAZI GERMANY. IT'S MY FAULT... ALL OF IT. A FOOLISH YOUNG MAN'S PRIDE OPENED PANDORA'S BOX. ALL THIS... EVERYTHING YOU SEE HERE CAME OUT OF IT. THIS MAN-- WHO IS HE? FRIEDREICH MAHLER. TOOK CREDIT FOR THE PLANE. CLAIMED HE BUILT IT. WAS A HERO WHEN THE PHOENIX STRUCK. TURNED SCAPEGOAT WHEN HE COULDN'T BUILD A REPLACEMENT. SEE, HE DIDN'T KNOW THE PLANE'S REAL POWER. HOW COULD HE? IT WAS LOST IN THE BLAST FROM ITS OWN BOMBS. MAHLER KILLED HIMSELF IN '65, UTTERLY DISGRACED. BUT LIKE ALL GOOD ARYANS, HE BROUGHT FORTH A SON WHO'S BECOME OBSESSED WITH THE PHOENIX, OBSESSED WITH TIME. HE STUDIED EVERYTHING WE DID IN '43-- THE SHIP, YOU, ALL OF IT. HE'S REOPENED THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT... CONVINCED HE CAN GO BACK 50 YEARS, WARN HIS FATHER AND CHANGE THE PHOENIX'S FLIGHT PATH SO IT SURVIVES THE BLAST. YOU MEAN... HE'S REBUILT IT? YOUR MACHINE? HE'S CLOSE. HE'S DEVELOPING A PLASMA THAT SIMULATES YOUR DNA SO HE, TOO, CAN SURVIVE THE VORTEX. TODAY MY VICTORIES ARE SMALL, SUCH AS FIGURING OUT WHICH MAY 4th YOU WOULD REAPPEAR OR WHERE SANTA PAULA USED TO BE. BUT TOMORROW NIGHT, WE DESTROY HIS MACHINE COMPLETELY. THEN WITH YOU SAFE IN FREE ALASKA, MAILER'S DREAMS WILL FINALLY PERISH. FREE ALASKA? YOU CAN'T STAY HERE. YOU'RE THE LAST PIECE TO MAILER'S PUZZLE. WAIT. LISTEN TO ME. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. YES...I DO. MAN WAS NOT MEANT TO PLAY WITH TIME. NO. MY SON... SON? DAVID, HERE YOU HAVE NO SON. COME SUNRISE, WE'RE PUTTING YOU ON THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD. THEY'LL TAKE YOU UP NORTH. AT LEAST YOU GET TO GET OUT OF THIS PLACE. AIN'T EXACTLY HOMEY, BUT THEN I WASN'T EXPECTING COMPANY. I HEAR ALASKA'S BEAUTIFUL. A LITTLE COLD. TAKES ABOUT A YEAR TO GET THERE, BUT IT'S WORTH IT, I GUESS. JUST THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING. YEAH. YOU'LL LOVE ALASKA, HERDEG. I DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT ALASKA. MY NAME IS DAVID. THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE CALL ME. ALL RIGHT. PLEASED TO MEET YOU, DAVID. CALIFORNIA? IS THIS AN ANTIQUE I.D.? NO. WELL, IT DIDN'T USED TO BE, ANYWAY. BAD PICTURE. THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE. WHAT'S THIS? WHAT? OH. IT'S A CREDIT CARD. IT'S A LEGAL WAY TO SUCKER THE MIDDLE CLASS. MIDDLE CLASS? CLINTON, BUSH, REAGAN... CARTER. DO ANY OF THESE NAMES MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU? NO. JOE DiMAGGIO... TED WILLIAMS... ELVIS. SINATRA? O.K., HOW ABOUT SUPERMAN? SUPERMAN. SOME KIND OF FAIRY TALE... FOR CHILDREN. WELL... CLOSE. BUT I HEAR SUPERMAN RETIRED, ANYWAY. THIS YOUR SON? THAT'S BENNY. HE'S A GREAT KID. IS HE WITH HIS MOTHER? NO. NO, HE'S NOT. DO YOU HAVE KIDS? NO. ATOMIC CONTAMINATION. WOMEN WITHOUT CHILDREN AIN'T WORTH TOO MUCH. [HELICOPTER APPROACHES] PROCESS INTO THE SUBJECT-- STANDARD PROCEDURE. HOW LONG? SIX MINUTES TO PARALYSIS. NOT BAD. DECREASE HEMOGLOBIN 10 P.P.M. YES, SIR. WE'RE GETTING CLOSER. PREPARE ANOTHER SUBJECT, PLEASE. ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL? YES, SIR. COMMENCE 24-HOUR STAND-BY. YES, SIR. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE? YOU'VE GOT TO LISTEN. YOU'RE JEOPARDIZING THE MISSION. HE'S OBSESSED. YOU SAID THAT YOURSELF. HE'S OBSESSED WITH ME. HE'S OBSESSED WITH TIME. NOW, WHAT IF WE COULD TURN THAT AROUND, USE IT AGAINST HIM, TEMPT HIM? WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? WE COULD USE THE MACHINE... SEND ME BACK TO '43-- STOP THE PLANE FROM EVER TAKING OFF. NO, NO. I TOLD YOU, NEVER AGAIN. WHAT'S DONE IS DONE. WE CAN'T CHANGE IT. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO TAMPER THIS WAY. THERE'S A DIFFERENT WORLD, LONGSTREET, WITH A DIFFERENT HISTORY. I WAS JUST THERE YESTERDAY. IT'S BETTER THAN IT IS HERE, MUCH BETTER. IT'S NOT PERFECT. IT'S GOT ITS PROBLEMS, BUT NOT LIKE THIS. IT'S A NIGHTMARE HERE BECAUSE HERE WAS NOT MEANT TO BE. BUT IT'S BEEN THIS WAY FOR 50 YEARS. NO. NO, IT'S BEEN THIS WAY FOR ONE DAY. I SWEAR. IT'S TRUE. DON'T YOU SEE? WE WON THE WAR. WE? WE WON THE WAR? YEAH. YES. THERE'S A CEMETERY IN OLD D.C. WHERE THEY LET US PUT OUT MARKERS FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE PHOENIX... STRETCHES FOR MILES. THIS COUNTRY WAS BURIED THERE... 6 FEET UNDER. GATHERING THE RIPENED FRUIT OF THEIR LABORS LIKE PLAYFUL CHILDREN. SAFE UNDER THEIR WATCHFUL FATHER'S EYE... LOOK AT ME, JESS. WE'VE GOT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. THERE'S TOO MUCH TALK, AND I KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. WE'LL FAIL, OR WE'LL SUCCEED. IF YOU DESTROY THE PHOENIX, WE WIN THE WAR. THERE'S MORE TO IT THAN THAT... A LOT MORE, I'M AFRAID. IF WE SUCCEED... I TAKE THAT PLANE OUT, THEN THIS WORLD... THIS PLACE... WILL NEVER HAVE EXISTED. NO PAST, NO PRESENT-- EVERYTHING THAT YOU KNOW-- IT WILL BE LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED. AND NO ONE WILL REMEMBER ANY OF IT? NO. NO. EXCEPT FOR ME. YOUR PAPERS. THIS IS TOO SMALL A LOAD FOR THE MILL. SPECIAL ORDER I-C-TWO. SUPREME COMMAND WANTS THESE STIFFS. VERIFY AN I-C-TWO. CHECK THE BACK OF THE TRUCK. YES, SIR. YOU'RE NOT ON THE SHEET. MUST BE A MISTAKE. ARE YOU QUESTIONING ME? WOULDN'T THINK OF IT... SIR. CHECKS OUT. HAVE A NICE DAY, BUB. BRING HER DOWN. [BELL RINGS] HERE'S YOUR STOP, BUB. GOOD LUCK. YEAH. GOOD LUCK. ENEMY ALERT. FIRST NAME--DAVID. FUGITIVE ALERT. FULFILL YOUR DUTY. FUGITIVE ALERT. LOOKS LIKE IT'S YOUR LUCKY DAY. POWER! WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, HOW COULD YOU REACH THAT CONCLUSION? HAND ME THAT, WOULD YOU? IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. THEY HIDE HIM. A DAY LATER, HE'S HERE ALONE. HE IS A THREAT. HE SHOULD BE ISOLATED, THOROUGHLY INTERROGATED, AND, IN MY ESTIMATION-- [DOOR OPENING] TERMINATED. QUIET. UNCUFF HIM. YOU'RE BLEEDING.
