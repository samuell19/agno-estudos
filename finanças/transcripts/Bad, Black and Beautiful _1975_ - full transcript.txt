[music playing] Yes, Mr. White. I'll have Ms. Turner call you as soon as she gets in. Thank you. Goodbye. [phone ringing] Eva Taylor. Attorney at Law. Yes, Snowball. Where have they got you? What's the charges? All right, Snowball. I'll tell Ms. Taylor as soon as she gets in. Bye. Good morning, Bee Bee. Good morning, Eva. Mr. White called and wants to know if you'd like to attend the governor's dinner Saturday evening? I'll check my calendar. Oh, and Snowball Jackson called. He's in jail and wants you to get him out. What's Snowball done this time? Possession. And here's another one of those notes. Bullshit. Call the bondsman and tell them to get him out, and then tell Snowball to come and see me. I'll call White myself. Oh, there's a young lady in your office with a problem. She's nervous as hell. Something about her boyfriend. OK. Maybe she's pregnant. Oh, don't let me think about that. Hello, Ms. um-- Paula Thomas. Are you Ms. Taylor? That's right. Now what might I do for you? Well, uh-- Hey, calm down, Paula. Whatever the trouble is, I'm sure we can work it out. Now, start from the beginning and tell me what has you so upset. Here, drink this. Mm. No, go ahead. It will help. Thank you. Now, start from the beginning and take your time. Well, you see, it's about my boyfriend Johnny, Johnny Boyles. We went together in high school, and like a lot of other boys, along came Uncle Sam. And they made him a demolition expert in Vietnam. And uh, all my letters I got from him said that how much he hated his work. And uh, I remember in one letter he said that he'd seen enough killing to last him a life time, and his only dream was to come back and to marry me. And-- [sniffing] I know it must have been pure hell for him over there. He was always so soft and kind. It was hard for me to imagine him in any kind of violence. Well, Johnny and I work for Mr. Springer and Company. And Mr Springer had promised Johnny that he'd have his job when he got back. Well, when Johnny got back, Mr. Springer had given his job to his son in law. He said that-- [sniffing] He could come back in about five or six months or so, and you know, then maybe he might see if he had another one. Well, he turned to his son and law and he said a lousy thing. He said that all men coming out of the army nowadays are-- uh, thinks the world owes them a living, and uh, he'd be damned if he get into his pocket book. Well, that did it. Johnny hit Mr, Springer and then he decked his son and law. Well, that, frankly, I was glad to see but, but if anyone had a free ride, he did. [knocking] Hi. Hi. That's a hell of a note, huh? Damn you, Johnny. I come up here planting a kiss on you and you call that a hell of a note? Oh, come on. You know what I mean. We're supposed to be thinking of our wedding day and I don't even have a job, that lousy Springer. Screw Springer. Springer and Company isn't the only place in the world to work. We can find new jobs tomorrow. JOHNNY: We? Yes, we. I can go to work for awhile. But honey-- I didn't come up here to discuss Springer and his company. Johnny, I waited a long time for this night. OK, what do you want me to do? Do? Oh brother. What did Nam do to you? Well, first of all, you can fix me a drink and then we can take it from there. You're right. I don't know what I'm so damned worried about anyway. [music playing on radio] Sure is a beautiful day. Yes. Have a seat Ms. uh-- Cohen. Faye Cohen. Well, Ms. Cohen, what can I do for you today? I won't beat around the bush, Mr. Jacobs. I'm not in the business that lets me call on the police too easily. Oh? What business is that? Are you kidding? Come on, Mr. Jacobs. I'm Faye Cohen. I'm in the flesh business, like they said in the newspapers not too long ago. I think they called me Madame Girls Incorporated. I heard you were a sharp investigator. Maybe I heard wrong. Easy, Faye. I learned a long time ago something that should apply in your business as well. I know nothing until I see the green light, and you didn't give me any green light. OK. You made your point. Now, what's the problem? About two years ago a young woman, Judy Adams, came to me wanting to get into the business. Not that I'm downing my business, mind you, but she was very young. Too young. So rather than line up tricks for her, I put her back in school and more or less looked after her. I couldn't help but remember that my own daughter would be about her age, had she lived. Go on. Well, it wasn't long and she was head over heels in love with some dude. She seemed very happy. I should have taken the time to meet him, but I never did. Anyway, about six months ago, something went wrong between them and they broke up. Then Judy started hooking. I tried to stop her, but she just laughed. She said she was a big girl now and I had no right to interfere. Well, things rocked along and she'd call or come by every day or so. And you know how it is, even though I didn't agree with the way she was living, and don't get me wrong, I've got some good girls, but Judy was more on the ball than to be a hooker. Faye, I'm not in the business of stopping girls from going straight. That's not what I came for. No? No. I want you to find her. She's been missing for about three weeks. Just about three weeks ago she called and said she needed to talk to me. She said she wanted some advice and wanted to have dinner with me. Well, she never showed. I wasn't worried at the time. I figured she'd scored a John or whatever. Maybe she'd even worked it out for herself. But now I'm worried. I haven't heard a thing from her since then. I wouldn't be too worried. How about the ex boyfriend? Maybe they ran off and got married. It's happened before. No, she wouldn't get married or do anything that would keep her from saying hello every no and then. Besides, she hasn't been in her apartment for three weeks. The newspapers are stacked up outside her front door. Her mailbox is overflowing. Now, that doesn't sound like someone that plans to be away for three weeks, does it? All right, Faye. I'll take the chase, but I'll need a picture if you have one and a look inside her apartment. Do you think you can arrange that? I'm way ahead of you. Here's a picture that was taken about a year ago. I have the key to her apartment. The address is 2121 South Parry in Cloverland. And here's a retainer. You've said the magic word. Find her, Rich. You'll hear from me soon. Damn it, Billy. I've been out chasing Mrs. Hoodfield's husband and his little playmate all over the town all night. And, hey baby, I'm a detective and I can't call you every five minutes. Hey, you just make sure that you don't have a little playmate of your own stashed out some place. Billy, prepare a file on this girl. She's a missing person. Right. You might want to take a look at this case yourself. OK. I'll see what I can do, but I'm due at headquarters on another case at this time. Hold down the fort and I'll check with you later. Yeah, I'll do that. Incidentally, how are you coming along with the Hoodfield case? Well, I've got most stuff on that case last night uh, wrapped up. And it's sad enough to say, she's going to be taken to the board, disciplined. Damn, I hate these divorce cases. Yeah. I do too but it pays, right? Right. So type the report and send with the yellow copy. Take care, now. Check with you later. Bye. Johnny Boyles? What the hell? Yeah. Police officers, you're under arrest. What the hell for? What have I done? You'll find out when you get downtown. PAULA: Two detectives came in and-- [phone ringing] Eva Taylor, Attorney at Law. Yes, Mr. Copeland. I'll ring her for you. [buzzing] Yes, Bee Bee? Mike Copeland on line one. Hello, Mike. I would love to. Hey, I can drive a race course as well as you, so why shouldn't I fly a plane as well as you? You're on for Sunday. Good bye, Mike, EVA TAYLOR [VOICEOVER]: Yes, Mike. You always seem to know when to call. [music playing] ANNOUNCER: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, race fans, boys and girls. Welcome to the Super Bowl. We've got some of the country's top-notch drivers. In addition to the prize money and trophies, the drivers are competing for those valuable points. Later tonight we'll 2, you a run down on how the drivers stand today. Tonight's feature race is worth 2,000 big ones, so stick around and let's see who's going to take that pot. 22 drivers off trying for that $2,000 pot. Mike Copeland off to a good start in pole position. There's "City Star" reporter Michael Copeland in car number five making his move up through the back. [car engine roaring] Number 15, Miss Eva Taylor, moving up on red car number five on the back stretch. There she goes. She's out in front going into turn number three. [car engines roaring] And there's number 15, Miss Eva Taylor, taking the checkered flag. Mike Copeland, coming in second. Luke Ward in car number 22 coming in third. [applause] All right, Miss Taylor. There you are. $2,000. That was one whale of a race and you are one hell of a driver. It got sort of hairy for the moment, but uh, I made it. [chuckling] That you did. Hi. I was looking for you. Wanted to congratulate the winner. Hi, Mike. I'm glad I finally got to race with you. You're a big name around the tracks. Uh, maybe, but not anymore. Oh Mike, just because I won one little old race? You are a groovy chick. How about a drink with the loser? Where can we go looking like this? Hm. How about my place? I sort of knew you'd say that. But uh, what about my place? I feel a lot safer there. MAN: Hey, I don't care where you car jockeys go, but get out of my office. I've got some work to do. The least I can do is carry the trophy. Thank you. MAN: Good race, kids. [music playing] [moaning] [music playing] Yes, sir. I'll take care of it. No sir. No way I'll let it connect to the company. Thank you. Well, what did he say? MAN: Eva Taylor taken the Boyles case. Oh shit. That's all I need. Eva Taylor gets Boyles off and then the cops are out looking around again. They pin this on me and I-- MAN: Hey, hey. Relax, Tony. Everything's going to be OK. I never should have been the one to knock off that old guy. I'm here at the company, Eva gets Boyles off, and then the cops are going to pin this thing on me. Now look, we made a deal. Yeah. You take the company, we get a piece of the action. You were the logical one that hit the old man. Besides, if he would have paid us the money he owed us, this wouldn't have had to happen. Nobody knows you hit him. Besides, we got Boyles. He's taking the fall for this. TONY: Yeah, Eva Taylor's not your typical run-of-the-mill lawyer. She gets Boyles off and then the cops are out looking for another patsy and-- MAN: Hey, relax. Mr. Boyles just had an accident. TONY: Yeah. Yeah, he was killed in uh, jail. Right. MAN: Fortunately for you, man, case is closed, Eva Taylor's got uh, no client, and the DA's happy. And what accident? The one I'm about to arrange. You two broads take him out there and kind of cool him off a little bit, will ya? Come on, baby, We'll take care of you. Hey, baby. What' going on? Hey, beat it. I'm busy. Blackie? Been looking all over town for you. Hey look, I'd like for you to make a hit for me. Yeah. Johnny Boyles. Yeah, he's in county jail. Hey, will you do me a favor? Get in a hurry on this one, will you? [buzzing] Andrew? Thank you. Well, hello, Bobby. And just what can I do for the DA's office today? Accident? What do you mean accident, Bobby? An inmate fight? You know that's a crock of shit. How bad was his face cut up? Now, you listen to me. I want my client protected. That's right. I don't care if it takes every damn cop in this city. And you tell that boss of yours if anything happens to Boyles, I'll spend the rest of my career nailing his damn ass to the wall. Bee Bee, get me Paula Thomas. And bring me everything on the Boyles file. So somebody's nervous, huh? Well, when I get through with this case, whoever it is, I'll have them shitting in their pants. MAN: Name? Full name. John Doe. MAN: Come on, turkey, let's cut out the jive. What's your name? John Williams. Address? 46 53rd. [tapping] Occupation? Oh, I do everything. We're going to find out who you are. Come on, let's go. [phone ringing] Hi, Randy. RANDY: What's going on, man? If you can give me a rundown on that other stuff, I'll probably treat you to a bottle of boon. Hey, that's going to cost you. I'm not going to give you information, but damn it, Rich. Tell me what in the hell you're working out. I don't know myself yet, but if my hunch is right, I'll let you know the biggest bust this town has ever seen. MAN: Well, hey-- Uh, that's all I know right now. OK. Hey, Mike, you son of a-- Watch out now. I might say something nasty in the press about Rich Jacobs, private detective or Tex bad boy with a badge. I've got to give you five for that one, man. Hey, you got a story for me? I could sure use one. Nothing now, Mike, but maybe in a few days. I heard they busted Wheeler with six pounds of uncut stuff. Small potatoes, Mike. For what I've got and what I plan to get, I'm going all the way upstairs to the big man. Stay on tap. You'll get the exclusive. Thanks, pal. Keep on trucking, Mike. You too, Rich. And uh, Rich, don't forget to duck Hey Mike. Mike, I don't want to seem nosy or anything like this, but you kind of dig Eva Taylor, don't you? Yeah. So what? Well, the word is out that she took on the Johnny Boyles case. There's some heavy people who don't like it. I thought you'd want to know. Hey, wait a minute, Rich. Eva's a good lawyer. And in fact, there's not anything I can think of she's not good at. That sort of thing doesn't frighten her. To tell the truth, Rich, it frightens me. How about taking this as a retainer and look after her, Aw, come on, man. It's only $100 bucks but I can get you a thou next week. Why is it friends always want to pay me? Yet [inaudible] selfish people want to beat me. Keep your money, Mike. This one's on the house. In fact, it's a part of the case that I'm working on anyway. Hey Rich, thanks. She'll be all right, Mike. Randy, I hear Wheeler got busted. You know about as much as I do about that probably. You think the big people were involved? Out in front of his house, man. After he got out of his Corvette, we popped him right then. We got tipped on the inside, man. It was beautiful. Can you give me any more information, Randy? I gotta make a living. Yeah, I know about you making a living. I'm still waiting on that bottle of scotch from the last time you were going to help me make a living, right? I never have seen that, have I? Huh? Thanks. MIKE COPELAND: It's coming. Is this is same thing that Rich Jacobs is working on? Rich Jacobs? I'm tired of hearing about Rich Jacobs, OK? Hey, didn't anyone ever tell you that it's the lady that's supposed to be late? I've been waiting almost half an hour. I'm sorry, honey, but the traffic on the southbound freeway was bumper to bumper. So what can I tell ya? EVA TAYLOR: I'll forgive you this time, but only this once. I've got the tanks topped off, flight plan filed, and we're ready for takeoff. MIKE COPELAND: Well, let's get it on. EVA TAYLOR: Redbird tower, this is Cherokee 864. Ready for take off. CONTROL TOWER: 864, taxi to runway 13. 864, roger. [engine roaring] EVA TAYLOR: Hold tight, Mike. I think you're in for quite a surprise. MIKE COPELAND: Oh really? EVA TAYLOR: Really. MIKE COPELAND: Just what do you have in mind? EVA TAYLOR: You'll see. [engine roaring] [music playing] Now zip down your fly and I'll introduce you to the mile-high club. MIKE COPELAND: Who's going to fly the plane? EVA TAYLOR: Automatic pilot, baby. MIKE COPELAND: Whoa, oh baby. I love sex but don't kill us doing it. EVA TAYLOR: Oh Mike, relax. MIKE COPELAND: Whoa. [music playing] [moaning] What time is it? 7:30. Mm. I've got to go. Uh uh. I've got a deadline. Oh, Mike. Eva, the editor won't wait. Oh, come on, Mike. I've got to go. I want you to stay with me. [sighing] Don't go anywhere until we've had a talk. Oh hell, Ginny. I mean it, Mike. Now you just sit there and hear me out. You owe me. What is it this time? Open bank book balance again? No. I'll tell you what's out of balance, it's us. And you know what's knocking us off balance? Eva Taylor. [inaudible] Come on, Mike. I know everything. Right down to the last sordid little detail. Oh hell, Ginny. How did you-- Never mind how. I just wonder what you're going to do about it. I don't know. I honestly don't know. Mike. I love you and I put up with your little flirtation for six years. But I don't think this is just a little flirtation. Right? Yeah. [sighing] What am I supposed to do? Just uh, pack up two kids and disappear? I need an answer, Mike. I don't have an answer right now, Ginny. OK. You've got one week to make up your mind. And I'll tell you one thing, if you decide to go with Eva, you're going to be giving up a hell of a lot of love. I don't think even your precious Eva Taylor would put up with your activities for very long. Me and the kids will. That is the difference that love makes, Mike. I'm sorry, Ginny. I still love you. But sorry, I'm not. You've got till next Tuesday. Let us know, Mike. [splashing] [exclaiming] [laughter] I don't mean to interrupt your screwing around but I thought we had a deal? Hey, Tony, relax. Come on in. Yeah, come on in, baby. Haven't you ever tried it in the water? How the hell do you expect me to relax? For Christ's sake, the Boyles case has been on for four days now and you haven't done a fucking thing about getting it fixed. Hey, there's nothing I can do. They got every cop in town guarding this guy. I don't give a shit. You're over here screwing around while Eva Taylor's getting this guy off. Hey, it kind of looks like Eva Taylor's your problem, right? Hey, how about getting Eva Taylor on the phone here, will ya? What have you got in mind? Hey, man, I say everybody's got their price. Let's see what price tags on this foxy female attorney, OK? Hello, may I please speak with Eva Taylor? Just a moment please. Hello, Miss Taylor, this is Elden Spencer. If you could meet me early in the morning at the skeet range, I got a proposition for you. How about 7:30? Fine. I'll see you then. Pull. [gunshot] Good morning, Miss Taylor. EVA TAYLOR: Good morning Mr. Spencer. Have you ever shot skeet before? Try me. Pull [gunshot] I hear you've been real busy here lately. Quite successful too. I've been pretty lucky, but you didn't ask me out here to discuss my success. Pull. [gunshot] That's where you're wrong, Miss Taylor. I'm very interested in your success. EVA TAYLOR: Get to the point, Mr. Spencer. Sir, I'm a very busy person. I hear you're defending a client by the name of Johnny Boyles. There's uh, certain people think he's guilty, strongly enough that he's guilty that they're willing to pay to see justice done. And just how much do they think justice is worth? About $10,000. These friends of your must not think a human life is worth very much. Pull [gunshot] Miss Taylor, I won't squabble over money. Johnny Boyles is guilty and it's worth $25,000 to see that you're not successful. Double. Pull. [gunshot] I thought youd' never shot skeet before. That didn't mean I'd never shot a gun. You have my answer. [ominous music] [music playing] Now, little baby, ain't I good to you? Yeah, I'm good to you all right. It's because I know you need it. I know you need to be loved. You need to get away. You need to feel free. See the colors, baby? See the colors? Red, blue, yellow, and gray. The little gray book, where did you put the little gray book, baby?

Don't look now but you've got two heavies keeping you company. I've noticed. But don't sweat it. I can lose them any time I get ready. Tell me, what do you know about a big man named Spencer? SLATS: You don't want much, do you pal? Come on, Slats. What do you hear about him? Heavy, heavy. He's a type of foreman from the boys in Chicago. He's the last word in this territory. Prostitution, narcotics, gambling, contract hits, all the organized stuff. Do you know what I mean? There's a little girl named Judy Adams. You know her? Yeah. Cute kid. Hooker, but nice. Seen her lately? No. She hasn't been around for awhile, but then she never did stay long when she did come around. She's a doll. She could get a trick in nothing, nothing flat. By the way, the dude that followed you in, they work for Spencer. Some kind of bad. He's got two broads working for him of the same caliber. Hey, Slats. Why don't you sing "Woman-Hater Blues" for me, man? SLATS: You got it, Rich. [music playing] [SINGING]She was pretty, she was fine. She had me going out of my mind. She had Satan in her eyes when she let my heart cry. Those women-hater blues. She wore satin, she wore lace. She had the cutest little angel face. She had Satan in her eyes when she let my heart cry. Those women-hater blues. Now every man in town looked her up and down. She put the girls to shame, yeah. She could turn me around with a smile or frown, hey. She really had my heart to play. She was so pretty. She was so fine. She had me going out of my mind. She had Satan in her eyes when she let my heart cry. Those women-hating blues. Talking 'bout those women-hating blues. Oh, get on out of here, women, 'cause I hate you. Women-hating blues. Yeah. Talking 'bout women-hating blues. [applause] [distant music] Easy now, Rich. There's someone who wants to talk to you.

And number two, I want you to stay away from Miss. Eva Taylor and Johnny Boyles. If you don't, again, you're getting in over your head. Mr. Spencer, you insult my intelligence. I'm an easy-going fellow. Here's five grand. If you're a nice boy, there's a lot more where that comes from. Damn, Mr. Spencer, you not only insult my intelligence, you've stepped on my integrity.

That is, if you're interested in making a few fast bucks. Yeah, we can dig some extra cash. You can say that again. OK, there's this black detective dude-- correction, private pig. Spencer wants him taken care of because he's getting too nosey. I hope you understand what I mean. Sure, baby. We get what you mean. You want us to do this dude's number. So what's in it for us? This dude's important. I pay five C-notes. Ooh, for that kind of money, I'd take on the president. Who is he and where do we find him? I'll make it easy for you. I'll even set him up. You know the old warehouse at the corner of Union and Pacific? Yeah, sure Blackie. We know the place. Be there at two o'clock because at 2:30 he'll snooping around. You make sure you have a good reception for him. Here. You'll get the rest tonight, that is if the uh, [inaudible] been taken care of. Don't worry. His shit's already cold. [indistinct conversation] [music playing] Rich, come over here to help me get drunk. I just came by to tell you-- To tell me she's dead? I know already. You're not as fast as television, Rich. Tina, don't be so rude. Get Mr. Jacobs a drink and get me a fresh one. What do you want, baby? I don't think so. Please, Rich, please? All right, anything with vodka. All right. Bloody Mary then. They say she committed suicide. Do you believe that? No way. She didn't, I know she didn't. But who would want her dead? I wish I knew, Faye. Rich, I hired you to find her. Now I want you to find out who killed her. Deal? It's a deal, but I think it's more than you know. FAYE: What do you mean? It wasn't suicide or a passion killing. It was a professional hit, and I think I know where the contract came from, but I can't prove it yet. Tina, take care of her. All right, boss man. Rich Jacob Detective Agency. Yeah, Billy, have you located Rich yet? I've called police headquarters and everywhere else I can think of. He's just out of pocket. Ah, hell. I guess I'll have to take this thing myself.

Check you later, babe.

One moment please. It's for you. Rich Jacobs. Rich, I've been trying to reach you all day. This is Faye Cohen. Sorry, Faye. I've been on the run. What's up? I was going through some of Judy's papers and I found a book with nothing but names and phone numbers in it. It's even got some kind of code. Do you think that could mean anything? Do you know some of the names? Are you kidding? Looks like a who's who of the racket. Do you find the name Eldon Spencer listed? Let's see. Yeah. Where are you? I'm in a phone booth on the corner of Main and Fifth. I can be at Charlie's Bar in two minutes. Charlie's at Main and Fifth, right? Right. I'll be there. Good. Take care and I'll check with you shortly. OK. [ominous music playing] [music playing in bar] Hi Faye, aren't you going to sit at the bar? Not right now, Charlie. I'm meeting someone in a few minutes. -Can I get you a drink? -Yeah. Scotch on the rocks. -Uh huh. How about you, sir? No drink, thanks. [ominous music playing] Here you go, Faye. Faye, Faye? Oh, shit. [music playing] WOMAN [SINGING]: Oh I look up to the sky, and see visions of you and I against a blanket of gold so sing me a rainbow. Now I look down lover's lane, at the blossoms blooming rain. Sends a thrill right to my soul and sings me a rainbow. No master painter will create a portrait of love he'll use a background of blue. With every color of the moon, every shade, every tune, then I find that portrait is you. Oh, I don't want to be free. Come fly away, just you and me. We'll find a lover's pot of gold and we'll sing the music of the rainbow. [music playing] No master painter will create a portrait of love. He'll use a background of blue. With every color, every note, every shade-- [doorbell chimes] [music playing] Well, hi, Ginny. I haven't seen you in two or three years. Come in. It's good to see you. It's been a long time. Don't just stand there, Ginny. Have a seat. I was about to fix myself a cocktail. Would you care for one? Sure, why not? EVA: What will it be? Oh, you know me. I'll go along with whatever you're having. Now, tell me, Ginny, you don't wait two or three years to visit an old friend. Is this business, social, or professional? Whatever it is, you came to the right person. Are you in some sort of trouble? You know, I'd do most anything for you. [music playing] Now relax. Wrap yourself around this. [music playing] Now, what can I do for you? Is it a loan? Name the amount. It doesn't concern money, Eva. It concerns you and Mike. Me and Mike? Come on, Eva. I've known for a long time that you and Mike have been seeing each other. It hasn't been a platonic or a business relationship. It's been a pretty torrid love affair. Now Ginny-- GINNY: Now let me finish. Now I don't mind if Mike wants to fool around once in awhile, but I'm afraid that he's really in love with you. I've been with Mike for six years. I love him. I love him very much, and our two kids love him too. All right. I'll lay it on the table. I love him too, much more than you ever could imagine. Don't do this to me. If our friendship ever meant anything, don't do this. Look Eva, I cannot compete with you. Mike loves sports. Aside from the newspaper, it's all he thinks about. It his whole life. And you can shoot guns and drag race cars. I can't do any of that. And airplanes scare me to death. Is that why you think Mike loves me? Just because I can do all those things? Or is it that I'm just a little more affectionate and I give them all the love he needs. Maybe you're just too damn cold. You listen to me, I am not cold. When you go to bed at night, do you just turn over and say good night or do you tell him and show him, I mean really show him, how much you love him and tell him he's wanted and needed-- Listen, I have spent many nights crying myself to sleep because he was out with you. Look, I'm not going to lose him, not to you or anybody. I wanted to come over here and tell you, woman to woman, that you are going to have a fight on your hands, a bigger fight than you ever seen in any courtroom or any racetrack or any of those damn place where you do so well. Oh Ginny. GINNY: Let me finish. You don't need to say a thing. We were friends once. But no more. [music playing] What am I going to do? [crying] Say, are you looking to bring home the money [inaudible]? Papa's girl or cold turkey? Um, papa's girl. Let me you get [inaudible]. [inaudible] [phone ringing] Hello? Hi. Is this Eva Taylor. Yes, this is Eva Taylor. Are you the famous attorney? Yes, the attorney. Are you the attorney for Johnny Boyles? Yes, Johnny Boyles is my client. Listen here, black girl. I want you to know what's coming down. Yeah. Boyles is guilty and if you don't help his getting convicted, baby, you may not be around to defend anyone else. Do you hear what I say? You might not even get to see the end of this case you're on. Get what I mean? Listen, you son of a bitch. I don't know who you are and furthermore, I don't give a damn. But you can bet your life my client is not guilty. After the trial, I intend to walk him straight out of that court room. Never mind, honey. You listen to what I say and understand. So don't send anymore of these threatening phone calls or anymore of those nasty notes. If you want to meet me in person, I'll be happy to shove them straight down your damn throat. Hey. Now, you heard what I said, so you can just kiss my black ass and that's the end of this conversation, mother. Well, uh, what's the scam? That's one tough broad. Hm. Ain't going for it, huh? I don't see why Spencer doesn't let us go ahead and hit that bitch. Come on, let's go. [music playing] [footsteps approaching] Therefore the State has every intention of proving that this is a case of premeditated murder, that Johnny Boyles willingly planned and executed the murder of one Joseph Springer on January the 17th of this year. Thank you very much. The defense? MIKE [VOICEOVER]: Defense attorney slowly we spoke in defense of her, stating that she would prove Boyles's innocence. [indistinct crowd chatter] -What will it be, Miss? -I'm looking for Willie. Could that be you? That's what my friends call me. Good to know you. My name's Cindy. I'll be your new waitress. Well, hell, it's about time. I mean, I've been on union's back for the past two weeks. I mean, you've got to have some consideration. I run a union house here. I play by their rules. What's with that cruddy outfit anyway? Hey man, don't climb on me. I don't run the union. And for your information, I just found out about this job 30 minutes ago. And another thing, I won't work for a bartender with a hot temper, so you can either be nice or find yourself another waitress. -OK, OK. I apologize. I do have to admit, your looks are an improvement over the last girl that worked here. And tell me this, are you pretty fast and uh, can you hustle? Fast, yes. The second item depends on what you mean. I'll hustle your drinks for you, but my bod I keep to myself. Now, if that's satisfactory, you've got yourself a waitress. OK, you're on. The house piano player starts at five. House buys the first drink, that's the Black Russian. Have it on the piano by five or I'll hear about it all night. Now, let's get a move on because in 10 or 15 minutes, this place is going to be loaded. Light up the candles and make sure you keep the drinks straight. Willie, baby, don't worry about me. Just make sure you mix them straight. WILLIE: Well, hello, Miss Taylor. Hello Willie. By the way, have you met Mike Copeland? Oh, sure. Willie and I are old friends. Yeah, I know Mr. Copeland. He only comes in when he's mad or wants to cry in his beer. Now, let's see if I remember correctly. Our council at law drinks rum and Coke. EVA: Right. WILLIE: And the newspaper reporter, scotch and soda when you made it. And boilermakers when you say it. What's it going to do today, Mr. Copeland? MIKE: I think I'll have a martini, just to blow your mind, boy. WILLIE: I was on kidding, Mr. Copeland. I was too. MIKE: Make it a scotch and soda. Two minutes to five. Where's the Black Russian? Oh yeah, thanks, kid. By the way, folks, I want you to meet our new waitress. Cindy, meet Eva Taylor and Mike Copeland, two of our very good customers. Make sure we treat them extra nice, you know what I mean? I try to be nice to everybody, but for a famous attorney and a newspaper man, we'll strain to be a little bit more nice. Rum and coke, scotch and soda, and the first one's on the house. Thank you, Willie. You keep an eye on that lawyer. I've got to go make a phone call. Gotcha. One Black Russian. [indistinct crowd chatter] Now that's what I call [inaudible]. Hey, I'm going to tell you something, honey, as week as Willie makes them, I could down an army. Go back and tell him to fix me one and make it right and I'll pay for it. It would be a pleasure. PIANO PLAYER: You're new here, aren't you? Yeah, I just started. Let me give you a tip. You've got some good spenders in this club, pretty much good joes. But when it comes to Willie, wear your brass knucks. He'll work you to death if you let him. Right on. [playing piano] [chuckling] Say, I know it's none of my business. You're right. But I heard it through the grapevine that you're not supposed to win this case. You're just there for a good show. Right or wrong? Wrong. I got it from a pretty good source, and $25,000 is nothing to laugh at. Well, let me give you some information, and this time from the horse's mouth. I'm a defense attorney. Maybe I'm not the best attorney in the world, I've seen and heard a lot worse. I've defended some good people and I've also been the defense of some scum. But to the best of my knowledge, I've never failed to get a man off when I knew him to be innocent. And I've lost damn few cases when I knew they were guilty, and that's battle enough for my conscience. But here's one for the record. I, Eva Taylor, have never, will never, deliberately lose any case when I know my client to be innocent. And that you can believe. OK, OK. Don't get excited. I just don't want to see my lady get messed up. Don't sweat it. How about another drink? Hm. Rain check. I got a go dance my readers around until after the verdict, remember? Rain check you got. And thank you. See you in court. [indistinct crowd chatter] EVA: Hey Willie, I'll have another. Right. Ladies and gentlemen, everybody quiet please. Quiet. There's a short story I'd like to tell you. A few years ago there was a girl that was a great entertainer, but her true love was to be an attorney. So her vocal chords sent her through college, and now she's a fantastic attorney. But I'll bet she's still a fantastic entertainer. Eva, how about it? One for old time sake? [applause] [piano playing] [SINGING]If I'm supposed to smile when you say we're through, that smile will be delayed for a tear or two. If I'm supposed to laugh when you say goodbye, that laugh will be delayed while I cry. This love affair was just for fun in the beginning. You even told me that you were only kidding. But if I'm supposed to smile and leave with a lie, I'll smile, I'll leave and then I'll cry. [applause] MIKE [VOICEOVER]: Eva Taylor shocked the court with a very abrupt end to the defense. She merely stated to the Honorable Judge Maynard, I don't feel the defense needs any more witnesses. Tomorrow Mr. Taylor and District Attorney Morrow will present their closing statement. [tapping] [indistinct crowd chattering] JUDGE: Foreman of the jury, has the jury reached a verdict? We have, Your Honor. JUDGE: Would you read the verdict please? We the members of the jury find the defendant not guilty. [screaming] He's got a gun. [gunshot] [gunshots] [screaming] [gunshots] [crowd murmuring] Well, Johnny, as far as I'm concerned, you're a free man. And as for me, I'm going to have a drink. Mr. Taylor, I don't know what to say. I don't know how to thank you. I, I told you I was innocent. That's OK, Johnny. But next time, just stay out of trouble. [music playing] You can't get away with this, Spencer. No, no, bitch. They'll nail you to the wall. This time you fucked up. You think so, huh? I know so. SPENCER: You should have listened to reason. If you had, you'd been $25,000 richer and everybody would've been happy. [music playing] Don't try anything. I'll blow your brains out right now. EVA: Go to hell, fart mouth. MAN: That damn private eye is right on our tail. SPENCER: Let him come. I want him too. [music playing] RICH: Hey, hold it right there. Hold it right there. Let me get this son of a bitch. [gunshot] Let her go, Spencer. Just you and me. Screw you. Get out of here or I'll blow her head off. Screw you. [gunshots] Thank you, friend. Come on, let's get you home. [music playing] OK, kitten. What's so urgent? I got your message. I've got an editor blowing his stack and a paperboy who won't even speak to me. Have you got a story for me? Yes, Mike. I do have a story for you. Maybe it won't make good copy but it will make a final edition. What do you mean? Well, Mike, it's like this. We've had a lot of fun together. The airplanes, the racing cars. It's been one thrill after another. But lately, it's become just a little too serious. Hey baby, this is crazy. What? It sounds like you're trying to tell me goodbye. I'm not trying to say goodbye, Mike. I am saying goodbye. And you don't know, you're a lucky man. You have your wife, family. And that's the type of man you are, domestic. And one day you'll be very happy that you are. [music playing] Baby, can't we talk this over? No, Mike. Let's end it as fast as we started it. One big zoom. [music playing] Good luck, Mike. [music playing] Are you ready to go home? Do you still want me? I'll always want you. Then let's go. [music playing] I know that that wasn't an easy thing to do. Well, at least it was the right thing to do, dammit. Tell you what? What do you say I treat you to the most fantastic dinner that you've probably had in the last 12 years? We'll go by my place for a little toddy by the fire and discuss whether or not you can break away for the next week or two to keep this very handsome and lonely private detective company on his next case. Well, Mr. Jacobs, that seems like a proposition to me. Well, this friend of mine had mentioned something about taking a jet setter to someplace-- oh, let's see, what did he say? Tiki Wiki, Waikiki? Waikiki? Hey, that's it. He really needs someone to pose as his wife for cover while he goes sailing, surfing, gambling. You know, all those things that [inaudible]. Well, it just occurred to me that I don't have a single thing that can't wait for the next two weeks on my calendar. So I just might be able to help those lonely private detective friend of yours out. Fantastic. We'll leave tomorrow at 3:00PM. Now how about that dinner? [music playing]
