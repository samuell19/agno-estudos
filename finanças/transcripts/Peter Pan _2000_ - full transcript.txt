- [Woman] Stars are beautiful, but they may not take an active part in anything. They must just look on forever. The older ones have become glossy-eyed and seldom speak, but the little ones still wonder. They are not really friendly to Peter Pan, who has a mischievous way of sneaking up behind them and trying to blow them out. But they are so fond of fun, but they were on his side tonight, and anxious to get the grown ups out of the way. As soon as Mr. and Mrs. Darling were out of the house, the smallest of the stars in the Milky Way screamed out, Now, Peter! - Mother! Mother. Oh, here you are, Mother. - Why, what's the matter, Father dear? - The matter? This tie! It will not tie. Not around my neck. Around the bed post, oh yes, but around my neck, no. It begs to be excused. - Say it again, Father. Say it again! - A little less noise there. A little less noise. Now, I warn you of this, Mother, that unless this goes around my neck, we don't go out to dinner tonight! And if we don't go out to dinner tonight, I never go to the office again. And if I never go to the office again, you and I will starve, and our children will be flung out into the streets! - Oh, Father! - Wait a minute. There. I've got it, Father dear. - What? Oh. We're alright for another day. (chuckles) - We're all right for another day! (dog barks) - I won't take my bath, Nana! - John, go and take your bath at once! Please, we're late. On your way, come on. - Yes, Father. - And you, my love. - At what time was I born, Mother? Why, you were born at two o'clock in the nighttime, dearest. - Oh, Mother, I hope I didn't wake you. - Oh. (audience laughs) They are rather sweet. Don't you think so, George? (laughs) - There is not their equal in the entire world, and they are ours. (chuckles) Ours. Oh, oh no, Mother, look here. I have hair all over my trousers! You, clumsy, clumsy! - I will brush you off, Father dear. - What? Oh, oh, thank you, Sylvia. You know, Sylvia, I think it's a mistake to have a dog for a nurse. She looks upon the children as her puppies. - George, we must keep Nana. - Why? - I'll tell you why. Tonight, I saw a face at the window. - A face at the window? Four floors up? - It was the face of a little boy. He was trying to get in. I was sitting here, by the fire, when suddenly I felt a draft, as though the windows were open. I looked, and I saw that boy in the room. - Well, I dare say, what do you mean he lept out the window? - But wait! He escaped. But his shadow hadn't time to get out. - His what? - His shadow. I hid it. I rolled it up, and here it is. - A ha! Well, I don't think it's anyone we know. - Oh, George. - Although he does look a scoundrel. - You know, George, I think he comes back trying to get his shadow. - Dear me. - Wait. I haven't told you all. The boy was not quite alone. He was accompanied by, well, I don't know how to describe it. - Accompanied by what, Sylvia? - By a ball of light, no bigger than my fist. But darted around the room like a living thing. - This is most unusual. - But George, what can all of this mean? - Well, what indeed? (Nana barks) (loud hooting) Oh, clumsy! Now I've got hair all over my trousers again! - [Sylvia] Nana. Nana. - Oh, go on, coddle her! No one ever coddles me, I'm only the breadwinner, why should I be coddled? Why, why, why? - George, not so loud. The neighbors will hear you. - Well, let the whole world hear. - Oh, for heaven's sake. - I refuse to allow that dog to loiter in my nursery for one hour longer. - Oh, father! - In vain, in vain. (dramatic music) Your place is in a yard! (Nana barks) - George. Remember what I told you. That boy-- - Am I master in this house, or is she? Come along, Nana. (Nana barks) (audience laughs) Come on, Nana! (Nana barks) (audience laughs) Kind Nana? (Nana barks) Good Nana. (Nana barks) Pretty Nana? (Nana barks) Yes, pretty, pretty. (audience laughs) (Nana whimpers) Fluffy, pretty, lovely Nana. Yes, come on. Yeah! (Nana hoots) Gotcha! Come on, let's go. Up the stairs now, I'm sorry. She's going to be chained up in the yard where she belongs. - Please don't take her, wait! - You're going to bed, we're leaving, and that is the end of it, I'm sorry, no! (Nana howls) - He's going to chain her up. She's awfully unhappy. - It's not Nana's unhappy bark, that's a bark when she smells danger. - Danger? Are you sure, Wendy? - Oh, yes. Is anything there, Mother? - Oh. No. (laughs) Nothing at all. It's all quiet and still. Oh, dear. I wish I weren't going out to dinner tonight. - Can anything harm us, Mother? After the night-lights are lit? - Oh, nothing, precious. They are the eyes a mother leaves behind to guard her children.

Come on, hurry up! This one! (Tinker Bell chimes) (Peter Pan laughs) My shadow! Oh. Stick! Shadow. Stick! Oh! Alright, shadow. I'll stick you on with soap! Here. (Peter Pan spits) (laughing) Shadow! Stick! Shadow. What's the matter with you? Come on, get up! Shadow! Stick! Oh, shadow, what's the matter with you? - Boy! Why are you crying? - What's your name? - Wendy Moira Angela Darling. What's your name? - Peter Pan? - Is that all? - Yes. - I'm so sorry. - Doesn't matter. - Where do you live? - Second star to the right, and straight on 'til morning. - What a funny address. - No, it isn't. - I mean, is that what they put on your letters? - I don't get any letters. - But your mother gets letters. - I don't have a mother. - Oh, Peter! - You mustn't touch me! - Why? - No one has ever touched me. - Why not? - I don't know. - Well, no wonder you were crying. - I wasn't crying about mothers, I just can't get my shadow to stick on. - Your shadow has come off? - It's dead. - Oh! How awful! - Yes, dead. - Peter, you've been trying to stick it on with soap. - Well, then? - Well, it must be sewn on. - Oh! What is sewn? - You're dreadfully ignorant. - No, I'm not! - I shall sew it on for you, my little man. - Alright. - But first we'll need a little more light. There. - Oh. Oh! Look at this! - [Wendy] Now, sit there. - Over there? - Yes. - Alright. - Oh, I daresay this will hurt a little. - I never cry. (Peter Pan shrieks) (laughing) - Oh! (loud fart) (whimsical music) - Well, it isn't quite itself yet. - Well, perhaps I should've ironed it. - Wendy, look! My shadow, my very own shadow! - It's only a shadow! - Yes, but it's all mine!

Now shall I give you a kiss? - If you please. - Alright. Oh, oh! Here. Here. There. - Oh, a button! - Yes. - Peter, I shall wear it on this chain round my neck. - Alright! (chuckles) Come on! - Peter! - What? - How old are you? - I don't know. Quite young, I guess. I ran away from home the day I was born. - You ran away? Why? - Because I heard my father and mother discussing what I was to be when I became a man. I want always to be a little boy, and have fun! So I ran away. And I've lived a long time among the faeries. - Peter, you really know faeries? - Yes. But they're nearly all dead now. - Dead? But why? - Children know such a lot now. Soon they don't believe. And every time a child says I don't believe in faeries, someplace, somewhere, a faerie falls down dead! Ah! (audience laughs) - Poor things! - Oh. I can't think of where she's gone. Tinker Bell. Tink! - Peter, you don't mean to tell me that there is a fairy right here in this room! - No! She came in with me. Shh, shh. You don't hear anything, do you? - No. The only sound I hear is like the tinkle of a bell. - That's Tink. That's a fairy language. - It seems to come from over there. - Wendy. I believe we shut her up in that drawer. (laughs) - Oh! (laughs) - Ah, you needn't say that, Tink. What? I'm very sorry. How was I supposed to know you were shut up in that drawer? (laughs) - What did she say? - Ah, she's not very polite. She says you are a great ugly girl, and she's mine. (audience laughs) (Tinker Bell chimes) Shh! Tinker Bell. You know, you can't be my fairy because, because I am a gentleman, and you're a lady. (Tinker Bell chimes) (laughing) She said you silly ass! (audience laughs) She's quite a common girl, you know. She's called Tinker because she mends all the fairy pots and kettles. (Nana barks) No! Oh, no! - It's alright. She's still chained up. - Who? - Come on out! - Right. - Peter, where do you live? - Way out there. - How do you find your way home? - Oh, you just follow all the golden arrows. - Where do they lead you? - It's a secret place. - Oh, please tell me. - Would you believe me?

Now, what do you see? - I see a pool of lovely, pale colors. - Squeeze them tighter. - Yes. - Tighter. - Yes. - And the pool will take on a shape. And the colors will become brighter. - Yes. - So bright that in a moment, they'll go on fire, and in that moment, just before they do-- - I see it, Peter! I see it! - That's it, Wendy!

If they are not claimed in seven days, they're sent far away to Neverland. I'm Captain, you know. - Oh, what fun it must be. - Yes. Well, we are rather lonely. - Oh? - You see, Wendy, we have no female companionship. - Are none of the others girls? - No. Girls, you know, are much too clever to fall out of their carriages. - Peter, it's perfectly lovely the way you talk about girls. Oh, John there just despises us. - Oh! He does, does he? - Yes. - Alright. There! - Oh, you're wicked. - But just-- - Well, you're not captain here. - Sorry.

(Tinker Bell chimes) She doesn't like it when you do that, so stop it. - What did she say? - Um, she said she's gonna do that every time you give me a thimble. - But why? - I don't know. Why, Tink? (Tinker Bell chimes) (laughing) She said you silly ass again. (audience laughs) - Well, she's very impediment. - I told you not to say, stop it! Go home. - Peter, why did you come to our nursery window? - To hear the stories. None of us knows any stories. - How perfectly awful. - Wendy. Wendy, your mother was telling you a really lovely story. - Oh? Which story is it? - Um, oh, about the Prince, and he couldn't find the lady who wore the glass slipper. - Peter, that's Cinderella. He found her! - And? - And they all lived happily ever after. - Oh, I am glad! - Oh, where are you going? - Oh, I'm going to tell the other boys. - Oh, don't go, Peter!

You could tuck us in at night, and make pockets for us. Wendy, none of us has any pockets. - Oh, it's awfully fascinating. - Yes. - Could you teach John and Michael to fly too? - Oh, if you like. - John, Michael, wake up, wake up! There's a boy here who's going to teach us to fly! (Nana barks) - Quick, someone's coming! Out with the lights, Wendy. - Hurry up, come on! Hurry! (Nana barks) - You see, Nana?

The Lost Boys were out looking for Peter, the pirates were out looking for the Lost Boys, and the Indians were out looking for the Pirates. (lighthearted drum music) - Lost Boys attack!

I could've shot him dead. - Aye, the first crack would bring Tiger Lily's Indians upon us. - No, that is true, that is true. Shall I after him, Captain? And tickle him with Johnny Corkscrew? Johnny's a silent fellow. - Not now, Smee. He's only one, and I want to mischief all the six. They must live around here somewhere. Scatter and look for them! - [Pirates] Ay, Captain! - Not you, Smee. - Not you, Smee. - Most of all, I want their Captain, Peter Pan! It was he who cut off me hand. Oh, I have waited long to shake hands with him with this. I'll tear him! - Yet I oft heard you say your hook was worth a score of hands, for combing the hair and other homely uses. (Smee exhales loudly) - Aye, Smee. If I were a mother, I shall pray to have me children with this, instead of that. But Peter threw me hand to a crocodile that happened to be passing by. - I have often noticed your strange dread of crocodiles. - Not of the crocodiles, but of that one crocodile! He liked me hand so much that he's followed me ever since! From land to land, from sea to sea, he follows the ship, licking his lips for the rest of me. - But in a way, it's a sort of compliment. (audience laughs) - Well, I want no such compliments! I want Peter Pan. Who first gave the brute his taste for me! Oh, Smee. (audience laughs) That croc would've got me long ere this if he could've crept upon me unawares. But by some lucky chance, he swallowed a clock. - A clock? - What? - A clock! - Aye, a clock! And it ticks on, tick, tock, tick within him. And before he can reach me, I hear the tick, and bolt! Once I heard it strike six inside of him. - Some day that clock will run down, and then he'll get you! - Aye, aye. That's the fear that haunts me. - It's alright, Captain. (loud steaming) - Oh. - What's that? - The seat is hot. Odds bods, hammer and tongs, I'm burning, Smee! Do something, do something! What are you doing? - Something. - Oh, shut up.

See, not knowing anything about my own mother, I'm fond of thinking that she was rather like Cinderella. - All I remember about my mother is that she often said to Father, oh, how I wish I had a checkbook of my own. I don't know what a checkbook is, but I'd sure just love to give my mother one. - Well, my mother was fonder of me than you mothers were of you! - No she wasn't, Slightly! - No she wasn't, Slightly! - Oh, yes she was!

Peter was bringing her to us! - Oh, no! To take care of us. - I did it! When ladies used to come to me in dreams, I'd say pretty mother, but when she really came, I shot her. Friends, goodbye!

I'll do my best. - [Lost Boys] I'll do my best! - Afterwards, before I put you to bed, I'll have just enough time to finish the story of Cinderella. - [Lost Boys] Cinderella? - Are you ready for today's lesson? - [Lost Boys] Yes sir! - Then listen to your father, and repeat after me. ♪ I won't grow up ♪ ♪ I won't grow up ♪ ♪ I don't want to go to school ♪ ♪ I don't want to go to school ♪ ♪ Just to learn to be a parrot ♪ ♪ Just to learn to be a parrot ♪ ♪ And recite a silly rule ♪ ♪ And recite a silly rule ♪ ♪ If growing up means it would be ♪ ♪ Beneath my dignity to climb a tree ♪ ♪ I'll never grow up, never grow up ♪ ♪ Never grow up, not me ♪ ♪ Not I ♪ ♪ Not me ♪ ♪ Not me ♪ ♪ I won't grow up ♪ ♪ I won't grow up ♪ ♪ I don't want to wear a tie ♪ ♪ I don't want to wear a tie ♪ ♪ Or a serious expression ♪ ♪ Or a serious expression ♪ ♪ In the middle of July ♪ ♪ In the middle of July ♪ ♪ And if it means I must prepare ♪ ♪ To shoulder burdens with a worried air ♪ ♪ I'll never grow up ♪ ♪ Never grow up ♪ ♪ Never grow up ♪ ♪ Not me ♪ ♪ Not I ♪ ♪ Not me ♪ ♪ So there ♪ ♪ Never gonna be a man ♪ ♪ I won't ♪ ♪ Like to see somebody try ♪ ♪ And make me ♪ ♪ Anyone who wants to try and make me ♪ ♪ Turn into a man ♪ ♪ Catch me if you can ♪ ♪ I won't grow up ♪ ♪ I won't grow up ♪ ♪ I will never even try ♪ ♪ I will never even try ♪ ♪ I will do what Peter tells me ♪ ♪ I will do what Peter tells me ♪ ♪ And I'll never ask him why ♪ ♪ And I'll never ask him why ♪ ♪ We won't grow up ♪ ♪ We won't grow up ♪ ♪ We will never grow a day ♪ ♪ We will never grow a day ♪ ♪ And if someone tries to make us ♪ ♪ And if someone tries to make us ♪ ♪ We will simply run away ♪ ♪ We will simply run away ♪ ♪ I won't grow up ♪ ♪ I won't grow up ♪ ♪ No, I promised I won't ♪ ♪ No, I promised I won't ♪ ♪ I will stay a boy forever ♪ ♪ I will stay a boy forever ♪ ♪ And be banished if I don't ♪ ♪ And be banished if I don't ♪ ♪ And Neverland will always be ♪ ♪ The home of youth and joy and liberty ♪ ♪ I'll never grow up ♪ ♪ Never grow up ♪ ♪ Never grow up ♪ ♪ Not me ♪ ♪ Not me ♪ ♪ Not I ♪ ♪ I won't ♪ ♪ No sir ♪ ♪ Not me ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ (audience claps) (suspenseful music) - The game is up!

(haunting singing) - Peter, look! A mermaid! - Wendy, watch out! Get away from her! No! - Oh, I did so want to catch a mermaid. - Wendy. Mermaids are such cruel creatures, that they try to pull boys and girls like you into the water, and drown them. - How hateful. - Yes. Now this, this is a fearfully important rock, Wendy. It's called Marooner's rock. Sailors are marooned, you know, when their evil captain leaves them on the rock and sails away. - Leaves them on this little rock to drown? - Nah, they don't live long. Their hands are tied, so they can't swim. When the tide is full, the rock is covered with water. And then the sailor drowns. - [Smee] Rock portside! - Pirates, come on, over there! Hurry. Come on! Follow me. (thunder rumbles) (ominous music) - Move, spalpeen, move! (ominous music) The Captain ordered us to hoist you to the rock, and leave you here to drown. - So, that's it! To the rocks with you, mate! - See here, Starkey. Starkey, not so rough. Roughish, not so rough. - No muling! This is your reward for prodding around the ship with a knife in your mouth. - Enough said! - Poor Tiger Lily! - Shh! - What's that? - Ahoy there, you lubbers! - Oh, it's the Captain. He must be close by. - We've put the Tiger Lily on the rock, Captain. - Set her free. - But Captain-- - Cut her bonds, or I'll plunge me hook in you. (hook clangs) - 'Tis queer. - Let's follow the Captain's orders. - Aye, aye! - [Man] Boat ahoy! - Shush! - [Starkey] It's the Captain! - Is all well, Captain? - Aye. Aye, all is very well. Where is Tiger Lily? - It's alright, Captain. We let her go. (audience laughs) - You let her go? - It was your own orders, Captain. - You called to us over the water to let her go! - Brimstone and gall, what rubbish is this? - Captain, we-- - Lads. I gave no such order. (haunting singing) - 'Tis passing queer. - Spirit that haunts this dark lagoon tonight, doest hear me? - Odds, bods, hammer and tongs, I hear you. - Who are you, stranger? Speak. - I am Jas Hook. Captain of the Jolly Roger. - No, no you're not! - Brimstone and gall, say it again and I shall cast anchor in you! (thunder rumbles) - Well, if you are Hook, come tell me, who am I? - A codfish! A stinking codfish! (audience laughs) - Stinking codfish? - Have we been captained all this time by a stinking codfish? - Oh, shut up! - That's lowering to our pride! - Don't desert me, bullies. (Peter mimics) Have you another name? - Aye, aye. - Vegetable? - No. - Mineral? - No. - Animal? - Yes! - Man? - Never! - Boy! - Yes! - Ordinary boy! - No! - Wonderful boy? - Yes! - Are you in England? - No. - Are you here? - Yes. - Smee, you ask him some questions. - Animal, mineral, veggie-- - [Captain Hook] Smee! - I can't think of a thing, Captain. - Can't guess, can't guess, do you give up? - Yes! - All of you? - [Pirates] Yes! - Well, then! I am Peter Pan! - Peter Pan! Smee, mind the boat. Boys, take care of him! (loud commotion) (loud yelling) (suspenseful music) (loud commotion) - Come on up! (grunting) You've lost your sword, sir, would you like it around your neck? (cheering) - Oh, Peter, you've saved my life. You are the bravest, most wonderful boy in the world. Is there anything you can't do? - Nothing! (loud cawing) - Peter, behind you! - No! - No! - Yes! - No! - Oh dear, your time seems to be up, doesn't it, boy in green? - Hook! - I'm coming for you, boy. Come on, Smee. - I'll save you, Captain. - Get in, get in! (gun fires) - No! - Peter. Are you alright? - Look how the water is rising. Soon it will be over us, listen. - We must go. - Yes. - Shall we swim or fly? - Wendy. Do you think you could fly to the underground without me? - I'm not sure. I am just a beginner. - Hook wounded me twice. I can neither fly nor swim. - You mean, we shall both be drowned? - Look how the water's rising. - Well, I won't go without you, Peter. I will stay. - And you a lady, never. Are you ready, Wendy? - No. - Go! - No, Peter! No, no! Don't make me go without you, Peter. No, please, no! - To die will be an awfully big adventure.

Right? - Right! - I can't be anything important. Would you like to see me do a trick? - Alright, Tootles. (loud commotion) - One, two, three! (audience claps) - [Wendy] The home underground was rough and simple. It was all especially entrancing to Wendy, because those rampageous boys of hers gave her so much to do. - Wendy. Now that we're finished, tell us a story. - Please. - Very well. (loud commotion) - Tell us the end of Cinderella. - Well, the Prince found her and-- - [Lost Boys] And? - And they all lived happily ever after! (cheering) - Yay! - Tell us the end of Sleeping Beauty! - The Prince awoke her and-- - [Lost Boys] And? - And they all lived happily ever after!

There's nothing nicer than sitting by the fireside with the little ones close by, Moher. (Wendy chuckles) - Peter, I'm too big for this cradle. - A little less noise there, please, a little less noi... - Peter, what is it? - I was just thinking. It's only pretend, isn't it? That I'm their father. - Oh, well, yes. But they are ours, Peter. Yours and mine. - Not really. - Well, no. Not if you don't wish it. - I don't. - Peter. What are your exact feelings for me? - Those of a devoted son, Wendy. - I thought so. - You are so strange. Tiger Lily is just the same. There's something she wants to be to me, but she says it's not my mother. - No, indeed it isn't! - Well, what is it, then? - It's not for a lady to tell. (Tinker Bell chimes) - Oh, I suppose she means she wants to be my mother! (Tinker Bell chimes) Tinker Bell, stop it! - I almost agree with her. (loud commotion) Then in you'll go. - Wendy. You promised to be my mother, remember? - No. Their mother. - Wendy. Do you know any lullabies to sing us to sleep? - A lullaby? - Yes. - A lullaby. - Yes, please. - Oh, I think so.

I'm homesick. I want to go home. - [John] So do I. - Yes, at once. Perhaps Mother is in half mourning by this time. - You're not leaving us, Wendy! - I must. Peter, I appeal to you to make the necessary arrangements. - If you like. Tinker Bell, you are to get up at once and take Wendy on a journey across the sea. (Tinker Bell chimes) - Dear ones. If you all come with me, I feel almost certain my mother and father would adopt you. - [Lost Boys] Peter, can we go? - Alright, go! - Then put your beds away quickly, and remember to bring the baby clothes you were lost in. (lost commotion) What is it, Peter? Is it pain? - No. - I'm going to get your medicine for you before your journey. Well, get your things, Peter. - I'm not going with you, Wendy. - Yes, Peter. - No. - But why not? - No! - Oh, where does it hurt? - It's not that kind of a pain, Wendy. You are wrong about mothers. Long ago I thought like you, that my mother would leave the window open. So I stayed away for moons and moons, and then I flew back, but the window was barred, for my mother forgot all about me, and there was another little boy sleeping in my bed. - Peter, are you sure all mothers are like that? - Yes. I don't want to grow up and learn about solemn things. I want always to be a little boy and have fun... No. No one's gonna catch me, and make me a man, Wendy. (loud commotion) No one! - It's time to leave! - Peter isn't going with us. - [Lost Boys] Peter's not coming? - We won't go without you, Peter. - Peter, what is she talking about? - If you find your mothers, I hope you like them. (loud commotion) (intense music) - Smee! - It's over. - But who won? - If Tiger Lily has won, she'll beat the tomtom. It's always her sign of victory. Listen. (tomtom drums) The tomtom, an Indian victory! (loud commotion) You are perfectly safe now, Wendy. Tiger Lily will escort you through the forest, since flying tires you so. Goodbye, boys. (somber music) - Peter. - Peter. - Go. Slightly. You are Captain now. Take them, safely go. - Peter. - John. - Goodbye. (somber music) - Tink, if you are ready, lead the way. (Tinker Bell chimes) - Well, that's your medicine, you know, Peter. - I won't forget it. - Peter. If you come for me, once a year, I'll do your spring cleaning for you. Will you come? - If you like. - Peter, if another little girl should come along, one younger than I, oh how I wish I could take you in my... Yes, I know. Goodbye. - Wendy. - Yes? (somber music) (loud commotion) - There we go. Take them all to the ship. The boys we will make walk the plank. (chuckling) And the Wendy will be our mother. - What about Peter? - This is for Peter. - Poison? - Aye! He's doomed. - No, no, shh, shh. Shh, shh. See here, I'll save you if you promise to be my mother. - I would almost rather have no children at all. (dramatic music) (chuckling) (dramatic music) (Captain Hook cackles) (Tinker Bell chimes) - Who's that? Is anyone there? Tinker Bell. What? Tiger Lily was defeated? Wendy and the boys have been captured by the pirates. I'll rescue her. (Tinker Bell chimes) Oh. That's just my medicine. (Tinker Bell chimes) Poison? Nonsense, who could've poisoned it? (Tinker Bell chimes) Tinker Bell! I promised Wendy I'd take it, and I'm going to. As soon as I sharpen my sword! (whimsical music) Hook! Tink, you've drunk my medicine. What's the matter with you? (Tinker Bell chimes) It was poison. You drank it to save my life? Tink! Dear Tink! You are dying. Your light is growing faint, and if it goes out, that means you're dead. (Tinker Bell chimes) Tinker Bell. Your voice is so low, I can barely hear what you're saying. (Tinker Bell chimes) You say you think you could get well again? If... Yes, if? Tink, Tink. Oh, Tinker Bell, if what, what Tink? Please, please tell me. (Tinker Bell chimes) If children believed in fairies? Children, wait, don't go! No! Oh! Do you believe? Say quickly, you believe! If you believe, could you clap your hands for her? Please don't let her die. Come on, let her hear you, please. (audience claps) Come on, come on, louder! Look. She's getting better, her light is getting brighter. That's it, louder! That's it, Tinker Bell, come on! (audience claps) She's alive! (audience claps) Oh, thank you, thank you! Come on, Tink.

(scared yelps) Jukes, fetch the lash. - Aye, Captain! - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. The cat, it's in the cabin. - Aye, Captain! - He's gone to fetch the cat. The grim and scratchety cat.

Perhaps it would be advisable to humor the hook, Starkey. - I'll swing before I go in there! - What? (chuckling) Well, well, well, well. Is it finally mutiny? Then Starkey is the ringleader, yes? Yes? Shake hands, Starkey! Did any other gentlemen say mutiny? - [Pirates] No, Captain! - No! (audience laughs) - I will fetch that doodle-doo myself! (dramatic music) Oh, something blew out the light! - Where's Cecco? - He is as dead as Bill Jukes. - What? - Cecco's dead? (loud commotion) - Lads, lads. Here's a notion. Drive them into the cabin.

Jane! - Peter, are you expecting me to fly away with you? - Of course, Wendy. That's why I came back. Have you forgotten? It's spring cleaning time. - I've forgotten how to fly. - Oh, but I'll soon teach you again. (chuckles) - No, Peter. Don't waste your fairy dust on me. - What is it, Wendy? - I'll turn up the lights, and you can see for yourself. - No, don't turn up the light. What is it? - I'm old, Peter. - Old? - I'm ever so much more than 20. I grew up a long time ago. - But Wendy, you promised not to. - Peter, I couldn't help it. I'm a married woman now. - No you're not! - And the little girl in that bed is my child. - No, she's not. No she's not, Wendy. You promised not, you promised to be my mother! No, go away, you promised me! (Peter sobs) - Boy. Why are you crying? - Hello? - Hello. - I'm Peter Pan. - Yes, I know. - I came to take my mother back to Neverland. - Yes, I know! I've been waiting for you. - For me? - Yes. Will you teach me how to fly? - Do you know any stories? - I know lots of stories. - Could you tuck me in at night? And mend my pockets for me? - Oh, yes! Peter, please take me with you. - Very well. But first, first I have to throw the fairy dust on you. (lighthearted music) Now, think lovely, wonderful thoughts. And up you go! - How sweet! - She's sweet! She's sweet! - Look at me, Mother, I'm flying! - She's my mother now. - He does so need a mother. - Yes, I know. No one knows it as well as I. - Come with me, Jane. - It's only for spring cleaning time. He wants me always to do his spring cleaning. - If only I could go with you. - You can't. You see, Wendy. You are just too grown up. Are you ready, Jane? - Ready. ♪ So come with me where dreams are born ♪ ♪ And time is never planned ♪ ♪ Just think of lovely things ♪ ♪ And your heart will fly on wings ♪ ♪ Forever ♪ ♪ In Never, Neverland ♪ Come on, Jane!
