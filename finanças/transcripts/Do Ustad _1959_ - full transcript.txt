You Tube - Video Running Time 02:27:11 You Tube search name - Do Ustad (1959) I Raj Kapoor I Madhubala (Full Movie with Subtitles) Captions by: Cinephile Media The witnesses' testimony, the evidence... and the public prosecutor's arguments have proven that... you, Jagannath... absconded from prison before the completion of your 10-year term. And you murdered Roshanlal too. The Court and the law have given you many opportunities to defend yourself. But you kept refusing. Your lips remain sealed. The Court gives you one last opportunity to offer the proof of your innocence. If you reject this offer... the Court will be compelled to pronounce its verdict. Speak! Do you have anything to say? In that case, the Court, in accordance with the jury's verdict... hold you responsible for the murder of the late Roshanlal... - and under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code... - Stop! I request the Court's mercy. I'm the younger brother of the accused. The law's discourse had no effect on the accused. Perhaps blood may speak to blood? Milord... please grant me an opportunity to reason with my brother. - Permission granted. - Thank you! Bhaiyya [brother], say something. Speak for our sake, if not for your own. Don't you remember? When we were young, you used to tell me... it's written that it's wrong to steal, it's a sin to lie? I used to steal... I lied... You used to say it's a grave sin to kill someone, to commit murder. I walked that sinful path. I should be standing in your place. Bhaiyya, what happened? How did this happen? I'll go crazy, wondering... how the man who showed me the way ended up on this destructive path. How? Say something... Please tell us... you won't speak? All right. I swear upon Munna that I'll break my promise. No! No. No... why is my soul being punished instead of my body? I will speak... I will speak. It is true that I was a brigand. It is true that I escaped from prison. My love for my child compelled me. It is also true that I committed a murder. I pronounced the verdict for all these crimes... on myself before coming here today. Other than the death penalty... the Law has no other punishment for my crimes. Now that I am being compelled to speak... I want to know... I want to ask... if the punishment for murder is death... how did these paths towards death come to be? How did a murderer reach this destination? I wasn't born a murderer. I don't know what blood [lineage] means. Nor am I aware of blood relationships. I haven't experienced a mother's love... or a father's guidance. But, yes... I know hatred and cruelty... and I know how to commit atrocities. Because I was brought up in this environment! As a child, I would hold my younger brother close to me... and beg for a few crumbs of affection and sympathy. But all we got was hatred, animosity and cruelty! We were given stones instead of food. We got deceit in return for our honesty. We were beaten for our hard work... Sorrows, troubles, humiliation, insults... You lazy good-for-nothing! You think it's your father's property? Seth... Why do you bring our father into this? You pipsqueak! How dare you argue with me? Get lost! Sethji... the fault was mine. - Beat me if you wish. Why are you beating my brother? - Shut up! What are you glaring for? Are you done?! Give us our month's pay. Pay? If you work without pay for a year... you still cannot compensate my loss. Get lost. Get lost! Get lost, you disloyal wretch. Dishonest fellows! Wonder where you come from! Get out. You goons! Raju, the Seth has deducted a whole month's salary. - Now what will we eat? - We can sell the seth's watch. Raju! You stole again! - Day by day, you're becoming a thief. - A mere thief, bhaiyya? - I'm going to be a master thief! Raju! The book says thieving is a sin. Burn that book! We lost our pay because of it! Impertinent wretch! I'll pull your tongue out if you criticise this book. - Give the watch here! - I won't give it. - I'll return it. - No, I won't. - I tell you... - Thief! Thief! Catch them, somebody! Thief, thief! Thief! - My watch! - Thanks to you, we lost the seth's watch too. The day is almost over and I am dying of hunger! Starving to death is preferable to living off stolen property. God, are you angry? Because Raju committed theft? He's ignorant, O Lord. Please forgive him. No one gave us anything. Now, please provide us with food. - We are very hungry. - He won't give us anything. Having lived with men, he's become stone-hearted too. - I'll give you food. - Where will you get it from? - We can sell mother's mangalsutra [wedding chain]. - No! It's all we have left to remember her by. It belongs... to both of us equally. Promise me... you will never part with this heirloom. I'll never part with it. - Are you going to fill your stomach with promises? - What do we do? No one will give us a single penny. A penny? Here, son, I'll give you plenty. Happy? And if you run an errand for me, I'll pay you Rs.10. - What's the job, sethji? - Go to the railway godown... - and bring back a small parcel. - Robbery? Robbery? No, my dear, where's the theft in this? - This is yours and mine. - What's that mean? - What's 'yours and mine' mean? - How do I explain to a child? Listen... suppose this book is in your hands. Whose is it? Yours. But if I snatch it, and it's in my hands, whose is it? Mine. If it's with you, it's yours, and if it's with me, it's mine. So how is this theft? Come on, bhaiyya... let's play yours and mine. Come on. - Why are you worried, son? - Come on, let's do it. - I'll pay you Rs.10. [Inaudible] [whispering] Meet me near the car. Look! Bhaiyya! Bhaiyya! We did pick up the parcel but the police came after us. My brother and I were separated. Then why have you come alone? Get lost, you scoundrel! Stop the car, driver! I say, driver, stop the car! Get out, you bastard. Get lost! Get lost, you scoundrel! For two pennies... for two bits... - honor can be bought and sold... - Raju! Raju... - Raju! Raju! - In these bazaars filled with hunger... - Raju... - men are bought and sold... - Raju! Raju... No! No... No! God! Now I can't be bought for two pennies, O Lord! Your hypocritical world looted me. I lost my father's guidance, my mother's embrace. That didn't satisfy you, so you took my brother away from me? For a fistful of gram? You're a lifeless stone idol. If a heart beat within your breast... then you wouldn't mock man's suffering. Snatching away every semblance of support, you wouldn't say... that when there's no one to depend on, there's always God. God, I've come here today, to tell you... that from now on, I'll be my own God. And I'll establish a world that will be better than yours. Hey! Hey, my wallet! Dear sirs, that had my entire month's pay in it. I've been robbed! My children will starve. What will I do now? Hey, look, there he is! Stop him! - Catch him! - Don't let him escape! - Get him! Where did he go? There's no road ahead. Come on, get in. [knocking the door] Click a photo. - Inform Patrol 2424. - Patrol 2424 speaking. We didn't find any trace of the thief. Nothing besides his footprints. We followed the car tracks, but even those disappeared suddenly. Make sure you don't suddenly disappear. Catching the Boss is no child's play. - Good day. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. - Understood? - It won't happen again, Boss. Babu... - What's today's takings? - All this loot, boss! Distribute it amongst yourselves. Because the loot that's come my way today... has confounded the whole world. It's worth millions. Look at it. I suspect Rajkumar had a hand in stealing this necklace. - Rajkumar [Prince]? Which Prince? - The Prince of pickpockets... Prince Abdul Karim, alias Rana Ramchander... alias His Highness Kartar Singh, alias Prince... etc., etc. He has had his share of big time thefts. Inspector saheb, this time he has stolen your intelligence! - What do you mean? - This Prince... alias etc., etc., etc. The one you suspect? - Yes? - He's scheduled to be released from this jail today. - Oh. - Look, there he is. - Saab, namaste! - Namaste, namaste. Arre, Mr. Chaubey? Good morning, Salam aleikum, Sat Sri Akal... tell me, what brings you here? You're a very fortunate man, Rajkumar. You haven't stepped out and Inspector Chaubey has come to arrest you again. - Jailor Saab? - Hmm? - Whenever Mr. Chaubey wants a raise... he can only think of me! But this time, he's mistaken. - Tell me, Mr. Chaubey, what's the matter? - The fact is that... a necklace worth Rs1.2 million has been stolen. Rs.1.2 million? Phew! This... was this shoe also stolen? This is a sample of the thief's shoe... size 12. - Size 12? - Yes. Mr. Chaubey, I used to be a Size 8. Languishing in prison has shrunk my feet to a 6.5. Take a look. Come on, have a look. Arre, saheb, this is a magnificent foot. It seems to be my big brother's. Here, have a look. Er, Rajkumar, your release orders have arrived. And here are your possessions. Tie this for me, Jailor saheb. Oh ho! Rajkumar, where did you steal these gold beads from? Mr. Chaubey, this is the only thing that isn't stolen. It's a memento of my late mother. A way to trace my missing brother. Rajkumar, I don't want you to come to this jail again. You know you have already served ten terms. But this time, Mr. Chaubey, forgive me, you were mistaken. I'm lucky that we met here. Would you have spared me otherwise? I won't spare any pains even now. I have to arrest that crook. The owner of the necklace has offered a reward of Rs.10,000. And you'll get a raise too, Mr. Chaubey! Yes? Hey, we're so glad you're out. - Where're the rest? - Julie has a cold, Boss... and JD has an upset stomach. So they couldn't come. - How's Worli junction? - Boss, you've been relaxing here... And we've landed in heaps of trouble. - Never mind. Let's start. - What? Iri Ra raka, aaka ka baaka, baaka ka taaka, Worli ka naaka The world is exploding, drop a firecracker every now and then Look at the poor, their plight lnflames my heart, that sight The work is done by poor, mute Kallu... while the rewards are enjoyed by Uncle Shambhu The world is exploding, drop a firecracker every now and then If you know how to make them bow The world, O Lala, will be at your feet The world is cruel, and will follow those whom the world deems worthy The world is exploding, drop a firecracker every now and then What a glance is yours, O infidel... that leaves a traveler bereft on the trail Things have been Topsy-turvy today The robber was being robbed The world is exploding, drop a firecracker at every step... Ha! I dance on the streets, singing Teaching beauty the art of love My song is rollicking So much better than Rock n' Roll The world is exploding, drop a firecracker at every step [Humming nonsense lyrics] Trying to steal the watch, huh? Go on, pull! Heh... No, Boss. I was just looking at the time. It's 12 o'clock. Trying to outsmart your Boss, Boss? You thought this was your older brother's? I did think so but you didn't give me the chance to realise... Why are you wasting time on small thefts? Try your hand at something big. You inserted your big feet; how will I try my hand... That's a magnificent foot! - You're a size 12, aren't you? - Huh? Get lost. Go about your work. Look what I've brought home. - What's all this? - Today, I've bought out the toy shop. - Put that here, Jugnu. - But, for whom? - For Munna, of course. Who else? - For our son? - Yes. He has to be born first. Then, he will play with these toys... and when he turns five, then he will sit in this car. No, my dear, you don't understand. You don't know anything. My son will be born driving a car. - What say, Jugnu? - Yes, sir! Hopes are indeed very pleasant... but don't tire yourself out chasing those dreams. My dear wife, I'm not chasing dreams. My hopes and dreams chase me. - What's so funny? - I didn't laugh at what you said... I was laughing at your shoes. My shoes? Why so? I heard the news on the radio that an expensive necklace was stolen. The thief's foot is as large as yours. - Size 12. - Look, my dear wife, right now, I'm very hungry. I want my food right away. How wonderful, my dear wife. You're amazing! You cook bitter gourd so well that I, who enslave the world... am enamored of this dish. As if you would starve without this bitter gourd if I were to die tomorrow. Firstly, you're mistaken that you will die tomorrow. And if you were to go, I'll have you write down the recipe first. There's nothing special about the recipe. I cook them in your presence daily. But... I add a special something before I serve you. What's the special ingredient, my dear? Your dear wife puts her love into it. You are amazing, my dear wife! Seems like Lord Indra's court has descended on Juhu. - Boss? - Yes? - You've been staring hard at the girl in the middle. - What's the matter? - She's an amazing chick. She's a golden goose. You will remain a goldsmith! Look at her through my eyes. I've a keen eye, Boss. Didn't you notice? She has two notes worth Rs.1,000 each. - How do you know? - Boss, Santa... Boss, at the Santa Cruz gas station... she bought 10 gallons of fuel. And she changed two 1000-rupee notes. We would have snatched it right there, Boss, but we didn't get a chance. - So what's the plan? - We'll assemble at Juhu tonight. And by morning we'll have the money. What say? Then we must lay a trap. - But how? - That's what I'm wondering. Do watch! Raj Kapoor's new film, Shree 420. Don't miss it. Please watch Raj Kapoor's amazing performance. Please come and watch. Don't miss it. - Don't miss the new film, Shree 420. - Raj Kapoor. - Don't miss it. - Shree 420. - Boss, the trap is laid! - How? The trap has been laid. Don't ask questions, just run. - Run, Boss! - Run! - Run, Boss. - Run! - Run! - Raj Kapoor! - Raj Kapoor! - Hey! Police! - Raj Kapoor! - [Muffled shouts of 'Raj Kapoor!'] - Where's Raj Kapoor? - Where are you going? - You have to go here, Boss. Go! [Muffled shouts and exclamations continue.] - Raj Kapoor! Meena, Raj Kapoor! - Listen... listen... - Yes, tell me. - Look, he's speaking to you. - Please, help me. - These people are chasing me thinking I'm Raj Kapoor. - Thinking? - You are Raj Kapoor. - Excuse me? - You put on an act in real life too. - Excuse me, what a strange thing to say. - You're Raj Kapoor, right? Not at all. Look, when I lie... - people believe me, but when I speak the truth, no one... - Well, never mind. This gave us a chance to meet you. You must attend our party this evening. - Your party? - Yes. - But... but... Why don't you call for a change of clothes? - The tele... telephone is out of order. - Never mind. We'll arrange something. Do come with us. Let's go. Please, come. Iri Ra raka, aka ka baka, baka ka taka... - How are the clothes? - They are alright. It seems like they were tailored just for me. It's fine. Raj Saab, how many awards have you won? I've had plenty of awards. So far, I've had ten opportunities. And if Mr. Chaubey comes along, then I'll get another one. But Raj Saab, you won an award at Karlovy Vary for Jagte Raho. - Who's this Chaubey from Mathura... - Mem saheb... Chaubeys aren't only from Mathura. Our 'Vary Karlovo' has the very best of Chaubeys. - 'Vary Karlova'? - Yes, of course. Huh? Never mind. Whatever be the name... - How was the place? - Oh, it has changed for the better. They have added a couple of dishes, the radio stays on, and... - there isn't a bedbug to be seen. - Bedbug? - Of course. Men and bedbugs stay together. But they have sprayed two rounds of DDT that... though humans survived, the bedbugs were bumped off. That's very good! Where else did you go? Where did we get a chance to roam around? During the day... we were restricted to the compound and locked up at night. Er... forgive me, but why are you whispering? Listen... you... did you go to Karlovy Vary? Or to prison? I've been to prison many times too. - You? Jail? - Yes, of course. Just yesterday, I went to jail for a film. And today, I enacted that scene for you. Too good! Raj Saab... - You... you are indeed a very good artiste. - There's no doubt about that. Raj saheb... give her a chance in your next film. - She can be a good actress. - Be quiet. - Yes, I had the same thought. - Huh? - So? Why don't you make a film with him? - How? - You are rich, aren't you? - Where do I have any control over it? My uncle is guarding it like a snake. - Snake? Miss, don't worry. I know how to catch snakes too. You must have a fair idea having watched Awara and Shree 420, right? Raj Saab, you sing very well. Please sing for us. Me? Actually, the fact is... film songs aren't any fun without other characters. If only there were boys and girls, costumes, sets... If you could make arrangements... Don't worry, sir, they're all here. Oh, you have all that? Then the song will be amazing! Only the boy and girl are missing. Dear sir, look over there. A girl... and a boy! Of course! And she's wealthy and I'm broke. You are a girl and I'm a boy My heart skips a beat when I look at you Under the coconut tree, stands a girl from Madras Like a delicate cotton bud Teasing me is a boy from Punjab Who looks like a rose in bloom You are a boy and I'm a girl My feelings flared when I saw you You are a girl and I'm a boy My heart skipped a beat when I saw you When tales of your beauty reached me in Punjab I have traveled to your threshold When I heard your name, dear sir, I left Madras behind And here I am standing beside you You are a boy and I'm a girl My feelings flared when I saw you You are a girl and I'm a boy My heart skipped a beat when I saw you Your eyes are intoxicating and your gait is that of a peahen And my heart said, 'This is amazing' You're no less, my beloved, you're like the full moon Even the moon fades before you You are a boy and I'm a girl The flames of desire blazed in my heart You are a girl and I'm a boy My heart skipped a beat when I saw you Watch out, my girl Be careful, my boy! Sir, I've stayed in hotels all over the world. But I've never witnessed such a theft. - It's never happened in our hotel before. - Then where did her money go? - First, ask her whether she even had any money. - How dare you! Write down my address. I'll send the money as soon as I reach. - Take this. - Why? - You may need it. - Thank you! 200... and 220... - 420. - Excuse me? Did you say something to me? I was counting the money. Raj Saab... I'll never ever forget your kindness. - You were inconvenienced because of us. - Not at all. Where's the inconvenience? It's your money, after all. - I beg your pardon? - Of course! Look, the more films you watch, the more money we get. Alright, Raj Saab, tell me, where do I return this money? Listen, don't send it to the studio. Then where do I send it? Er... that... let it be. I'll take it some other time. - But... Raj Saab, you... - Listen to me... - Hmm? - I'm not Raj Kapoor. - No? - No. Whoever you are, you are very nice. Iri Ra raka, aka ka baka... Baka ka tata, tata ka taka Iri Ra raka... aka ka baka Hey! Hey, once you reach Pune... your uncle will drive all this out of your mind. - Ara Ra Ra raka indeed... - Why did you have to remind me of him? This uncle has made my life a misery! My father earned all this wealth. He died... leaving this idiot as my trustee. By making you his trustee, my father left a snake to guard his wealth! I cannot allow you to decide my fate. I will not marry this donkey! It's a sin, my dear, to call your future husband names. She has my permission, uncle. In today's times, a woman should at least have this freedom. Shut up, idiot! Did you see how he kept quiet? My dear, you come from an affluent family. - You need a slave. Not a husband. - A chicken, at that. We can always get you an equal match, my dear... but they will never do your bidding. Do my bidding? Or yours? I don't want your wealth to be squandered. Your late father worked hard to accumulate this wealth. And you want to appropriate this wealth for free. My father willed... that when I marry, the wealth would belong to my husband and me. And you... you want me to marry this idiot, so that... - you continue to control this wealth. - Yes, that's what I want. If you refuse this alliance, I'll have to use force. Make arrangements for the wedding. Hey, photographer! Take a photo quickly. - I want proof of my child's wedding. - Yes, sir. - I am dead! - Shut up! She can run away from the wedding venue... but she can't escape my clutches. Advertise her photo in the newspapers and say she absconded with Rs.100,000. Announce a reward of Rs.10,000 for anyone who finds her. No, no, this is impossible. I can't believe it. Look... look at this... Can such an innocent girl abscond with Rs.100,000? The poor girl does look very innocent. Why, what's wrong? Just read this. Her uncle has given an advertisement... stating that she's absconded with Rs.100,000. And offering a reward of Rs.10,000 to the person who finds her. - Poor thing. She's in big trouble. - Trouble? Why? Of course! All the rogues in the city will be after her. And that man with the size 12 shoes? I wonder what schemes he must be plotting. - We have it made! - Why? What happened? Look... look at this. She's the same girl who disposed of Rs.2,000. But boss, you only gave us Rs.1,580. - You gave back Rs.420. - So what? - So what? Now she's played a hand for Rs.100,000. - What do you mean? It says here that this girl ran way with Rs.100,000. And there's a Rs.10,000 reward. Then our film's made! Ha! 'Film's made' indeed! That's all you care about! Dude, all the big-time rogues must be after her for the Rs.100,000. Porter! Porter! - Khan Saab, do you want a hotel? - No, sir. Porter! Khan, stay at our hotel. All the Pathans from Peshawar stay there. Sir, I said I don't want a hotel! - Porter! - Move it. Khan Saab doesn't require a hotel. - Khan Saab... Khan Saab, have you come from Pune? - Yes, sir. Khan Saab, you came from Pune. Was there a girl in your compartment? - What sort of girl? - This one, Khan Saab. This one. Oh, yes, yes... this girl got in at Pune. She spoke very politely, said she had no one in the world. You say you're her brother? You are lying! I swear upon God she's my sister, Khan Saab. Look... - She looks so beautiful. - So she's your biological sister? - If you do find her, give her Abdul Rehman's regards. - I will. Why are you drawing on your beard and mustache? Why don't you remove yours and stick it on, big brother? Who are you? Who? Hey, move it. Idiots! How are you, my dear Abdul Rehman? Khan, you've come to Bombay alone? Why didn't your father, Baba Khan, come with you? Hey, I don't know you, mister! Why are you calling me 'Mister'? Call me 'uncle'. I'm your father's friend, Badruddin Pitalwala. And you're my guest. Hey, I won't go with you, mister. What do you mean you won't go? I'll carry you home. Badruddin Seth, you can't take him, he's my guest. - Don't cry now. Come, my boy, let's go. - I won't go, uncle. Hey! - Hey, Badru, come on. - Shamshu's father! Hey... - What happened, Begum? - That wretch took my burqa. Go inside! Praise God that you didn't go along with the burqa. Get inside! That 'papadwala' is toast now. Boss has come out in a burqa. Now 'big brother' has had it. Don't waste time, my boy, get in. - You... - Time's... - Hey, Khan Saab, why are you leaving me behind? - I've no one to call my own. - Who's this woman? What's this, Khan Saab? Who's this woman? Why is she crying? What can I say? He's upset with me and is leaving the house. - What can I do? I've five kids... - But who are you? May God bless you. Marry ten times if you wish; when am I stopping you? - But why are you abandoning me? - Hey, begum... Hey... hey, begum! Why are you chasing him? My boy, Abdul Rehman isn't even married. If he's unmarried, where did these five children come from? My dear sir, this woman is lying. Blatantly lying. You've forgotten, uncle. Why don't you tell him, Khan Saab? You attended our wedding, uncle. Have you forgotten? What's this, my dear Abdul Rehman, why aren't you saying anything? That this is a fraud, a farce? Call the police! - Police! Police! - Heck, I'll call the police! He had five kids, married her, and now, he's abandoning her? A Pathan is abandoning his duty? Take the woman with you or we will force you. Thank you. May Allah protect you, Khan Saab. May Allah protect you. Now don't dishonor your name, Khan Saab... - let's go home to our children. - Come on, get in. - Go on. - Sit inside. - Sit. - Go on, mister. - Go on. Get going. - It's sheer fraud. - Drive on, cabbie. Go on, my dear. Allah be with you. You can't outsmart your boss, Boss. What sort of a woman are you? Men usually kidnap women; you're a woman kidnapping a man? Matters of the heart always run counter, Khan. What can I do? Remember this, whether you are a good woman or bad... you won't get anything from me. I'm an impecunious Pathan. I have nothing! Just leave me alone! I agree that you are a poor Pathan. I also agree that I should leave you alone. - But, my Khan, where will you go? - Arre, I'm a Pathan. I'll go somewhere, find a place... - You just leave me alone. - Oh, but what am I for, then? My dear Khan, I'll make room for you... in my heart. - Hey, driver, take us to Hotel Victory. - Go to hell! - Damn you! - May Allah protect you! Do go freshen up. - Why don't you bathe quickly? I'll just get a priest. - A priest? - Priest? - Yes. - Begum, you're thinking of getting married? You've trapped me! Hey, now go shower quickly. It's getting late. May Allah protect me. Now I'll have to take a bath, begum! You've trapped me, damn it! Begum, you really trapped me. What have you got yourself into, Madhu! Uff! Priest... girl... wedding... How can two girls get married? Uff! Begum! The water is freezing! I'm dead! Don't try to sneak a look. I swear upon God, begum, I didn't come to look at you. I came to get my clothes, my dear. May Allah protect me, Khan Saab... in my hurry, I brought your senior wife's clothes. She doesn't wear men's clothing. Oh dear! Then what will I... I... wear after my shower, begum? May Allah protect you. Here's your senior wife's coat... You can wear this to get married. Open the door and take it. All right, begum. I'll take it. Give it here, begum. Give it. Now will you come out, or shall I join you? No, no, no, don't come here, begum. What are you saying? You... I... I'm showering, begum. What sort of woman are you? Boss! - And the thing? - It's in here. [Singing] [Singing continues.] Oh, my dear! Begum! Snake! Snake! Help! Snake! Who's this, begum? Raj Kapoor? Didn't I tell you I know how to catch snakes? And don't you remember? I'd told you I'm not Raj Kapoor. - Then who are you? - Whoever I am, I'm very nice. Isn't that so? But... you... - Such deceit! - Even my heart had deceived me at Juhu. I was left gazing after you, while my heart traveled with you to Pune. So this charade was planned to take back your heart? - If you have no use for it, return it. - Whom do I address it to? His Highness Rajkumar, C/o any police station, Bombay. 'Raj Kapoor' at times... 'Rajkumar' at others... If you want to say my name with love... then, Rajan. - Rajan! - Again. - Say that once again. - Rajan. I wish... I wish... I could take your photograph. My photographs were published in the newspapers. Didn't you see them? - I saw them and thought... - What? All the world's rogues will be chasing you. - There's one right here. - You're right. - Then you tell me what I should do. - You fraud... Hey, listen! Hey, tarry awhile; where are you going, my crazy girl? - Won't someone stop her? - Okay Promise me that you will never... - deceive me. - Okay! You put on a show of being rich... but you really are Mr. Fraud I'm not like that at all... - so clean up your act when you visit. - Okay! Promise me... that you will never - deceive me - Okay! Your whimsies are rather attractive... and rip the strands of my heart Please warn your graces... - to stop this atom bomb, - Okay! Tarry awhile; where are you going, my crazy girl? - Won't someone stop her? - Okay! You're passionate, I'm carefree We're two birds of a feather If you consent, perhaps I can live... - for a couple of days loving you. - Okay Hey, Rajan, the lift isn't halting. Tarry awhile, where are you going, my crazy girl? - Won't someone stop her? - Okay Promise me that you will never... - deceive me. - Okay Got here, big brother? You won the gamble at the station, so you took her away. I'll handle it from here. Aren't you stretching a bit? How dare you try to abduct another's wife? I need the money, not a wife. Give me the Rs.100,000, you keep the wife. She's not my wife. She's the golden goose. A golden goose! I'd to use many a subterfuge to get her. Let's do one thing. Give me the gold... - and you keep the goose. Yes? - The problem is even I prefer the gold. - Isn't the game going too far, big brother? - The game can end too. - Can't we reach an agreement? - What do you want? The fruits of my labor, which I would have got from her uncle. You give me Rs.10,000 and I'll consider you her uncle. - What do you think? - Hmm, you seem to be an intelligent man. - Here. Take this. - That's more like it. Uncle Badruddin, you are very lucky. Uncle, one doesn't usually get something worth Rs.100,000 for just Rs.10,000. Forgive me, Khan Saab. I was broke, my friend. Sorry, huh... Bye. We've searched her, boss. We've searched her bags too. - We found nothing. - Then why was this fake advertisement published? - I'm asking you, girl! - My uncle... is the trustee of my wealth. It's worth millions. He wants to kill me to usurp that wealth. Hmm... I'll keep you alive to obtain that same wealth. I've already given away Rs.10,000 as reward. I'll have to recoup that from your dastardly uncle. I'm not a cheat! It's true... Have you begun to deceive yourself, Rajan? You? Gambling for big stakes? - Where did you get this from? - He must have ruined some innocent soul. You've strangled my hopes. You've auctioned my love for you. You've strangled me! - Why, had enough? - He's folded. - Can't you stop it? - Die, Rajan! - Die! And that's the end of that nuisance. If you thought me a nuisance, you should have killed me, torn me to pieces... - But... this betrayal? This deceit? Why? - Why? Why? Because this is what the world taught me. The years molded me. My principles are underlined by fraud; deceit governs my life. I'm what I am. I can't change. No one can make me change. And that's because you haven't known a mother's love... You do not recognise a sister's affection. Nor are you fated to realize a wife's ardor. You've never sought your life's goals in another's eyes. You have lost, Rajan. You haven't gained anything. You're an unfortunate man. You spurned me... Me! The person who could have given you the world. The one person who could have given you everything you wanted. The one who could have given you everything. You are right. You could have given me everything. I'll look for you. I'll look for you, Madhu. It would be great, my friend... if, at the New Year's party, this girl, Madhu Sharma... - Yes? - Would be present. - Word! - We have our little ways to bring her around, pal. - Really! - Really? - Yes. - Is that so? Then, get her into such a mood... such a mood that she gets flirty... and says, "I'm in love, I'm in love with you... Oh, my, what do I do?" I've fallen in love with you, oh, what do I do? My piercing gaze, babuji... has learned to cast hundreds of magic spells Stir this intoxicating gaze of mine into your goblet of wine Drink to your heart's content. Live to the fullest Go on, drink up! I've fallen in love with you, oh, what do I do? Everyone's crazy about my beauty, Mister John They flutter like moths around this flame, O Baba Khan You are a cartoon, you are a braggart Your moustache resembles the tail of a bear And here I go... Well, alright, bye-bye We've fallen in love with you, oh, what do we do? - Madhu's gone? - Gone. - Where did she go? - Come, let's look for her. Gopi! - Yes? Go look for her! I'll call Boss. Tell me... What?! But where were you? Go after them! They shouldn't be allowed to get away. I'm coming. What happened? Where are you going? Someone's broken into the safe and stolen the money. I'm going to the police. I don't understand your business. You have to get up at night to go to the police. - Let go. - I want to tell you something. - Let go, they're coming. - Listen! You dare come in between? Kick him! Teach him a lesson! Who's... Who is that? I... I'm not a thief. Those brigands are after me. They will kill me. - Please save me, my sister. - Who are they? - Why do they want to kill you? - Thieves... thieves... They want to stake my life for the money it will win them. Don't worry, my dear. No one can harm you here. - It won't take them long to get here. - I'll shut all the doors. Sit down and relax. Look, there's water there. Have some water, you'll feel better. Don't worry. Hey, what's this? Don't worry, my dear. I've closed all the doors. Open the doors, my sister. Fate has thrown me back into his snare. - Sister! - Whose snare? What do you mean? If this house... if this house belongs to the man... - whose portrait this is... - This is my husband's portrait. No! No! No... this portrait is that of the brigand... who's trying to kill me. You're lying! Your tears cannot besmirch my husband's honor. - The whole world knows him to be a good man. - No! No... you've mistaken the Devil for God. Open the door. If this girl escapes, the Boss will kill all of us. - Let go of me. - Boss... - Let go! - We've got the girl. - Let go of me! - Very good! Now she'll know the consequences of escaping from our custody. Remove the veil! The veil has fallen. You cannot fool me any more. - But... - Has the cat got your tongue? - Why don't you ask how I got here? - How? You went in search of a thief... and Fate brought her to your house. That innocent girl is not a thief. You are! - Kamala... Leave us alone! - No! Let them know who I am. Let them know your alternate reality. They should also know... that those who abduct women, can have their womenfolk abducted too. This is how they're abducted. Enough! Enough, Kamala! You haven't seen the world I have seen. The world of a brigand? One who has caused people immense pain! One who has murdered innocents. One who set others' peace and happiness ablaze... to illuminate his home. I saw you... - and thought you were God. - God?! God? God has no place in my life. How can God enter the Devil's domain? You lifeless stone idol, watch this if you can... Today, I've established a world where there is no place for you! This is my victory! This is my triumph! No! No! No... this is your downfall. Don't consider this your victory. Why? Because, today, I'm leaving you in a world of darkness. - My dear wife! - Don't you dare! Don't call me that! My child... will not be born to be called the child of a thief and a brigand. You won't be able to see your son! You won't be able to hear his voice! Even your shadow will not darken his life. You will look for us everywhere but will never find us. You've mistaken the Devil for God. My child will not be known as the child of a thief and brigand. Even your shadow will not darken my son's life. I had lost my senses, I was befuddled. But what were you all doing? Why didn't you stop her? Her tears left us stunned too, boss. This should not have happened. Go, look for her, all of you! And if you don't find her, I'll smash your heads! I took many blood samples, Mr. Rajkumar. But... only yours matched. Then, what's the problem, doctor? If my blood can save her, here it is. - Really? - My child... I... I don't want the blood of a thief. I don't want the blood of a thief. I don't want the blood of a thief. - I don't want it. - Are you ready, Rajkumar? No! No... What happened, Rajkumar? Didn't you hear, Doctor? "I don't want the blood of a thief." And you know, Doctor, that I am a thief. I'm not a good man. My blood will poison her. It will kill her. I don't wish to kill her. Don't give her my blood. But your blood will save her, Rajkumar. It's God's will. Or your blood would not have matched hers. These emotions wouldn't have made themselves felt. You have changed, Rajkumar. Come, don't waste time. It doesn't feel right, doctor... This is the first sign of humanity. Good has triumphed over evil. Congratulations. Congratulations. God... years ago, in front of you... at this very place, I'd spurned your world. I'd vowed I would create my own world. I did everything your world would consider disreputable. If you could, I'm sure you would have witnessed that... that today, your world bows to me. Yet, I continued to cling to the one good thing in your world. I loved my wife. And now, when that love was to bear another soul who would hate your world... you took that life itself from me. Remember this, O God... the flames of my vengeance will never be doused. If my wife doesn't return home by morning... I'll destroy everything that's beautiful in your world. And wherever I see another innocent soul... I'll silence it... like this! I... I... - I'm alive? - Yes... Far from death. You're in my house. But I wanted to die. - You saved me. - God did. - It's His will. - But I don't want to live. I don't want the shadow of a thief and brigand to fall upon my unborn child. The shadow of a thief and brigand... - Who's that brigand? - The father of the child I bear. Your husband? What's his name? I wouldn't speak his name then because I was his wife. And now I won't speak his name because it's disreputable. I want neither this child, nor this life. Let me die! I want no trace of this name to remain... Don't say that. You can destroy his lineage, but the stains will remain. Your child will be born, my sister. It'll definitely be born. A child... who doesn't know his father's name... who will never see his father's face... what will his life be like? His life will be what you wish it to be. I... I myself... am... this house... Please consider me your brother. I... I... I'll... I'll consider my sister's child dearer than my own. I swear... I swear that... even the shadow of a thief shall not fall upon your child. The rent has increased. And the doctor has asked you... to arrange for some money if possible. Earlier, we used to double our money, Boss. You decided to go straight, but our families are starving. Come back to our old business, Boss. - Drop this scourge! - Everything will be fine, Boss. Your boss is dead! Thieves and theft will not come near this house. My sister needed good food, milk, medicines... I couldn't give her anything, except my honesty, my friends. Everyone may die, but I'll never let her faith be extinguished. God! I want to sell this ring. It looks simple but I'll have to inquire about its value. Please wait. Look, you can't get more than Rs.25 for this. - Only Rs.25? - Yes. It's an expensive watch. Just Rs.25... Madhu... What? The girl is in the shop? Don't let her go. I'm coming. Believe me... I've changed. - Trust me. - I'd trusted you. But you sold me... you auctioned me off to the highest bidder. - I hate you! - Listen! I love you. I think about it day and night. I'm filled with regret. I go crazy wondering why I sold my beloved to that goon. - Trust me! - The man you call a goon? I can trust him. Not you. I know what will happen if he finds me. But with you... anything. You heard that? Between the two of us, the girl trusts me more... - than you. - Don't interfere. This is a personal matter. I have bought this personal matter for Rs.10,000. - Understand? - Rajan! - Learned your lesson? - Rajan! Look at this, Mr. Chaubey. Look... look at it carefully. The mark of that size 12 shoe is imprinted on my face. Trust me, Mr. Chaubey, I can catch him just like that! You mean to say such a big police department... runs on the help of pickpockets like you? Huh? Get lost! Wise guy. Mr. Chaubey, firstly, I'm no longer a thief. And that's why I starve, like any ordinary, respectable person. And secondly, the fact is I've taken on some responsibilities. Really? Congratulations! Have you got married? No, no... My respected elder sister has come to stay with me. That's why I've given up thieving. I want to live honestly. Mr. Chaubey, life has handed me a great opportunity. If you help me... I'll be successful too... and, Mr. Chaubey, you'll also get a raise. Arre, why are you always concerned about my salary? Huh? What's the matter? Do you think you can handle that brigand? Mr. Chaubey, absolutely! Absolutely! Just hear me out...[whispers] [Whispers] I have some good news, Boss. We have a buyer for our diamonds. - He offers hard cash. - You don't think it's a con, do you? When it's a matter of life and death, I'm never deceived, Boss. - Who is he? - He's the Prince of the underworld. Extremely wealthy, and deals in hard cash. Just a little bit of alcohol, and a comely young girl... and Boss, a little bit of music thrown in... and then listen to the joyous tinkle of money rolling in. Welcome, your highness. Please come in. [Speaking 'foreign' language.] [Speaking 'foreign' language.] - What did you say? - The arrangements are wonderful. I'm flattered. [Incomprehensible] Beautiful! What a sweet voice! Can I entertain some hopes? We don't disappoint our guests. But my heart is closed to men. Oh, I see you have been deceived in love. Hmm? - How can you say that? - My ancestors were astrologers. I'm an astrologer. I can tell you the secrets of your heart. - What can you tell me? - Ah... when you met him... neither you nor he were the same again. You were deceiving the world, and he was deceiving you. - You've thrown me into confusion. - How can I do that? You're still in love with him. You're bashful here; while over there, he is repentant. - He's repentant? - Very repentant. He loves you a lot, my dear. Will he... will he meet me once? Just once? - Do you love him too? - Very much. - Really? - I love and hate him equally. - Swear upon God, you love him? - Yes! You love him very much? O Gulan! Gulan!

By God! I thank you from the bottom of my heart. - Now tell me, how can I be of service? - Your highness...

Er... will your men wait here too? - Absolutely! Without a doubt. Please come this way. - Let's go. Show me the necklace. Look at this! Look at this, your highness. - Your eyes will be... - By God!

Don't you dare try escape! Listen... arrest everybody! Nobody should be allowed to escape! Come with me. Unlock it. Open the cell. Mr. Roshanlal Sharma... - Yes, tell me. - There are no charges against you. But you may be required as witness. You may leave now. You haven't filed any charges against that sweet-voiced beauty, have you? Unlock it. Er... Miss Madhu Sharma, you are free. There are no charges against you. Rajan Saab... My dear, if you want to marry Mr. Rajan... I'm very happy. But, come home. - I'll organise a grand wedding. - Please don't interfere in this matter. - Inspector saheb... - Hmm? - Please make her understand... - I'm her uncle, after all. - You are my enemy! - Oh! Brother! Come home quickly. Sister is very ill. Really? Madhu, I'll see you later. The midwife has also given up hope. What will happen now? If anything happens to sister, then God knows how Rajan will face it. He has pinned all his hopes on this unborn child. God forbid if anything happens to mother or child... Rajan will be shattered! Rajan... Child? Another deception? It's a baby boy! [Celebratory exclamations] Hence, the Court... sentences the accused, Mr. Jagannath, to ten years' imprisonment. Congratulations, Rajan! Come, collect your reward. - Let's go. - Come. Arre, what's this? - Have you... again... No. - Then? - This money? - Have you forgotten that I'd helped nab a thief? The thief is behind bars and I got the reward of Rs.10,000. God bless that brigand. The darkness of his fate has illuminated our home. Our home is illuminated. All our worries are over, my sister. The times have changed. This money will give us a new home, a fresh life and happiness. Boss! - Tell me! Do you have any news? - Yes, Boss. Madhu has joined a theater company. Theater company? Where? Which one? She has gone out of the country with the theater company. - She went out of the country? - Yes. She didn't even meet me? Did I commit an offence? What... what could have gone wrong? Forget the past, sister. I joined your theater so I could forget. With your help, I will go far away from his world. - Far, far away... - And after four years... - when you return to Bombay? - I'll never return to Bombay. Now I will never come to Bombay. Never! You will surely return, dear sister. As a big [theater] star. And the very people who hurt you will grovel before you. - Raja dear! - Yes, Baba? - Raja! Look... I take you to the movies every day, right? - Yes. - Right. Today I'll show you something new. - I'll take you to a play. - A play? What's that, Baba? - Er... - Are there fights in the play? Of course! There are fights; it has everything... - Come on, get dressed quickly. - Alright! - Run along now. What do you want? Whom do you want to meet? Er... I... I want to meet Madhu Sharma. Madhu Sharma? No one can meet her. Please tell her that Rajan wants to meet her. - So you are Mr. Rajan? - Yes. - You cannot meet her at all. Please go away from here. Get out! But... Boss... what will happen now? - Look... - Mm? - You take Raja to the hall. - Okay. - I'll think of something. - Alright. Come on. The world thinks I've come here inebriated... inebriated...

I'm hungry.. - Ln a moment. Go on, then. Go home. - Well done, well done! - The child is hungry! - What a performance, sir! His performance was all very well, sethji, but see what he's done to my face! It looks great. Your contract is canceled from today. You're the villain, and he's the hero. Throw this hero out! He's such a fine actor, gives a performance worth a lakh of rupees. It's either him or me, Seth saheb. What will I do without you? Heroes like him are a dime a dozen. Go on, get out! Go! - Hey, Raja, wait up! - Hurry up, mother. Oh ho! Where are you going, Raja Saab? - Arre! - Raja! - Raja Saab is... going to Ranibagh. A motor car is going with him. And it will race with me. - Here, boss. - Idiot!

Before Madhu can escape, kill her! - When? - Now! - But, Boss... - No ifs and buts! - Throw the ball! - Come on, come on! [Muffled shouts and exclamations.] - The child is all right. - What happened? - Let me assist you. - Leave it be. [Muffled conversation.] If the child's mother or any of his relatives inquire about him... - tell them Madhu Sharma has taken him. Come on, driver. - Yes, ma'am. - Arre, which Madhu Sharma? - She... - Raja! Don't worry, ma'am, your child is fine. He had fainted... The famous actress, Madhu Sharma, took him away. - Madhu Sharma? - Yes. She's Mr. Jagan's wife. Boss, that child must surely be his, too. - Bhabhi! [Sister-in-law] - How does it matter to you? Get in. - But Boss... - Come on! Driver! - He met with an accident, bhaiyya. - Accident? Yes. And some actress called Madhu Sharma took him away. - Madhu Sharma... where? Which hospital? - I don't know, bhaiya! People said he was slightly hurt. - Bhaiyya! Bhaiyya... - Don't worry, my sister. - Don't worry. I'll bring him back. - Bhaiyya! Why did you bring me here? My car hit you... - and you fell unconscious. - So you did me a favor? Yesterday, you threw my Baba out, and today you're doing me a favor? You love your Baba very much, don't you? Baba loves me too. - Really? - Yes. - Listen... - Mm? - Your Baba... does he love your mother very much? Why wouldn't he? Mother loves him a lot too. You're the only one who fights with him. What do you know... Anyway... alright, tell me... does your Baba love your other siblings too? My siblings? Where do I have any? Why? Your Baba didn't have any other children? - When did my Baba get married? - What? Not married? Then how's your mother related to your Baba? My mother is Baba's... Catch him! Catch him... Raja! My dear, you've saved my life! - Come on, Raja. - Rajan! - Take him. - Okay. Rajan! Rajan... - Let me go. - I've got you back with such difficulty. - How can I just let you go? - Then don't let me leave, Madhu. Have me thrown out. Call your men. - Won't you forgive me? - Why are you mocking me? I am an ordinary motor mechanic... and you... a world famous actress. Please don't shame me. I... I thought you were a married man... and so, left you, Rajan. Believe me, I love you more than I love myself. I've pined for you all these years. You punished both of us for such a tiny misunderstanding? I'm culpable. Punish me. - What punishment can I give you? - I'd you... thrown out; you... you can slap me. - How many? - One. - That won't do. - Two? All right then. Make it eight... nine... ten... Your eyes shoot darts as sharp as can be Not one or two but eight, nine, and ten My love, I admit defeat. Enough! Enough is enough O fair one, how are your wrists so delicate? I surrender to you, my dearest I haven't ever seen such beauty, slim as a sugarcane O how sweet you are... I've been ensared by your charming conversation Not once, not twice, but eight, nine, ten [times] O fair damsel, I admit defeat... Enough! Enough is enough Your eyes shoot darts, as sharp as can be Go on with you, don't flirt with me You have twisted my delicate wrist You not only stole my heart but also made a hue and cry about it Tell me, how do I not leave you? You cast taunts at me, laughing all the while Not one, not two, but eight, nine and ten My love, I admit defeat. Enough! Enough is enough Your eyes shoot darts as sharp as can be My dearest, tell me, where are you going... with that sparkle in your eyes? I'll love you, fair damsel, I'll love only you Even if they arrest me for loving you My veins have begun to tremble Not once, not twice, but eight, nine, and ten [times] Fair one, I admit defeat. Enough! Enough is enough Your eyes throw darts as sharp as can be... Stay away from me, my love Don't say I didn't warn you Keep your heart safe I may look innocent but I'm as deadly as a bullet I have kept snakes as pets Your snake-like tresses have already bitten me Not once, not twice but eight, nine and ten [times] Enough is enough Your eyes throw darts as sharp as can be Not one, not two, but eight, nine and ten My love, I admit defeat. Enough Enough is enough Your eyes throw darts as sharp can be - You're new here? - Yes. - Babu! - Boss! - How are you here? You had escaped, hadn't you? Thanks to your son, Boss! My son? I have no son. My son died, along with his mother, even before he was born. No, Boss. Your son is alive. - What are you saying? - It's the truth, Boss. Come here. I saw both your wife and your son. I wanted to speak to bhabhi, Boss... - but Roshanlal stopped me. - Roshanlal! - Is that wretch still involved in this story? - Yes, Boss. He wanted me to murder his niece Madhu. Trust me, Boss. I would have killed her... but your son saved her life. Your son's courage is amazing! So that means my son has taken after me. I'm so unfortunate that I cannot even see him. But you've seen him, how does my son look? His facial features resemble bhabhi's... and in courage, he could be your clone. A mixture of you both. That's your son. But I can't even see him once. Babu, can you tell me where to find him? Roshanlal can tell you where to find him, Boss. Roshanlal, Roshanlal! Roshanlal... But how do I leave here? How do I escape? No!...No! Such a huge defeat! Such a complete rout! Can't this... can't one put an end to this darkness? Can't these chains be broken?! I'll break these chains! I'll break these walls! I'll break them. He escaped! Mother... mother, look! This criminal broke out of jail! Jagannath, your life is over. No, there's a spark of hope. And I'll extinguish that spark like... I've come to you as a desperate father, Roshan. I am searching for my child, and you can help me. Roshanlal demands a price for any help he offers. - What's the price? - I'm willing to pay anything. You will have to commit two murders. Two. One for you. And one for me. I have failed to remove Madhu from my path. Now you have to murder her. - That's the first. - And the other? Rajan. Your old enemy... - and Madhu's lover. - No! I'll search for my son... on my own. And having met him once... having met him once, if I'm not yet arrested... then, Roshanlal, two murders will take place. One is you... and the other, Rajan! Jagan! Now you can't escape! Inspector, I came to meet my son... - Once I meet him, I'll surrender myself. - No! Inspector... Jagan! Wretch! Escaped again! Why are you staring at me? Follow him! - Found him? - No! Not there either. - Look there! - We did, sir. Ghost!...Ghost! - Ghost! - Where? How silly! Are you scared? 'Ghost, ghost' indeed! Let me see what a ghost looks like. Hey, where did the ghost go? Hey, ghost! Come out! - Are you in pain? - Yes. Then why don't you say that you need help? - But who will help me? - I will. There was a dialog in the film, Hunterwali... "The brave help the weak." And I'm brave. Give me your hand. Come with me. Of course, my friend! I've seen you somewhere before. He must be in one of these houses. Yes... I remember. Your photo was published... - saying you were a brigand? - Yes. You know that photo of yours? I showed it to my mother. Mother twisted the newspaper and... and handed me such a thrashing... that I began to see stars. If your mother came to know... that you helped a criminal... - then? - So what will happen? I'll get another thrashing. Have you seen the film, 'Hatimtai'? Remember that character who helped Hatimtai? I'll fetch you something to eat. It seems like you fill my thoughts You weren't there, but... it seems like you are ever present What will you do, tell me, if you fall in love with me? If I make you pine for me, tell me, what will you do? Crazily attracted to your divine beauty... I'll remove your veil with trembling hands And if you can't get your hands on it, tell me, what will you do? If I make you pine for me, tell me, what will you do? What will you do, tell me, if you fall in love with me? If I make you pine for me, tell me, what will you do? One day, you will be caught unawares And then I'll tarry awhile in the shadow of your tresses And if you don't find that shade, tell me, what will you do? If I make you pine for me, tell me, what will you do? What will you do, tell me, if you fall in love with me? If I make you pine for me, tell me, what will you do? Those nights that will be lonesome without you I will share my deepest feelings with you in my dreams What will you do, tell me, if you don't dream? If I make you pine for me, tell me, what will you do? What will you do, tell me, if you fall in love with me? If I make you pine for me, tell me, what will you do? - Now? - Hmm? - Now? I want to read your palm. - Why? I want to see how many children you will have. What happened? The only hope I have of finding my long-lost brother... - it can't be bought. Don't worry. I'll look for it too. We'll surely find it. Found it! Rajan, I found it! I found it! It's this, right? - Yes. - Here. You keep it. This is what I wanted to give you. - Rajan! - It's a memento of my mother. Keep it safe, Madhu. - What happened? - I've never known a mother's love. How nice it would have been, had your brother been found too... and if mother was around. I don't have a mother, Madhu. But, God gave me a sister instead. - She is mother, sister, everything... - You talk about her everyday... - but never take me to meet her. Hmm? - Shall we go today? - Let's meet her today? - Yes. - Now? There's a Diwali puja at home today. We'll assume Goddess Lakshmi has visited our humble abode. Come. Arre, I haven't even changed after the show. Let me change. You go on. - Hmm? - Please do come. My mother made my Baba give up all his crooked ways. Didn't your son's mother make you give up theft? Son, I wish I was your Baba. My father was a great thief too. But when mother came, he straightened up. Once he stopped thieving, we starved. Mother was ill and I was just about to be born. - There wasn't a penny at home. - Who told you all this, son? Baba, of course. Who else? - And yet he didn't steal? - Not at all. - Then what did he do? - He caught a big criminal. - Someone like you. - Then? - Then what? Just like a hero gets rewarded for catching a criminal... my Baba too got a reward. Rs.10,000! - Rs.10,000? - Yes. Then I was born and mother got well. Then we had a new home and everything was alright. Everything became all right. Everything became alright! Child of my enemy... your father built a new house; he began life anew! Why don't I just strangle you? Why? Have you stooped so low, Jagan? Avenging yourself on this innocent child? Shame on you! - What happened then? - Mother blessed the criminal... saying that he had done us many favors. Do you know, my son, who that thief was? Mother doesn't know and Baba doesn't tell me. That criminal... I was that criminal, son. You? You escaped from prison and found refuge in my home? Yes, in that house, which was built with the reward for my arrest. I had vowed not to allow even the shadow of a thief to fall on Raja. - Go downstairs, Raja! - No! Let the child remain here. - He sheltered me. - Sheltered? - Yes. I was hiding from the cops when this child brought me here. - I didn't know this was your home. - Come here, Raja! - Come here, Raja! - Why did you bring this man here? Why? Does your mother know you've given refuge to a criminal? No, Baba. - Mother hates thieves and rogues. - She hates them. - And you help them. - No, Baba... he too, has a child like me. - He's looking for him. - So how does that concern you? You lie to deceive even this innocent boy? - The times are bad. Even my truths are seen as lies.- Get lost! - I won't let you ruin this house. - My life is being ruined. If I go out of this house, they will catch me and hang me. Then I won't be able to see my son. - I have no sympathy for thieves. - I may be a thief... but I am also a father. Let me stay here tonight. I beg of you. You won't see my face in the morning. I don't want to see it even now. A thief in this house... Don't forget you were a thief, too! I used to be, but not any more. You could never know why I changed. Whose hard work and whose faith built this home. You must have had the support of a good person. Once, I had the support of a good person too. But you were fortunate that you reformed yourself. Whereas I remained who I was. Still... you and I share the same brotherhood. As a brother, give me sanctuary. Even if you had been my biological brother, I still wouldn't let you stay. - Get out! - One night, just one night. - Get out! - Let me stay for one night... - Get out! - No, Baba!, no! - Raja! I won't let him go. He has done us many favors. Raja! Move aside, Raja! You struck this innocent child! - Had you not been his father... - What are you saying? I would have broken your neck! Now you will leave here. Go on! Get out of here! Open the door! - Is there no one here? - Raja! My son! - It seems the rogue has taken Raja too. - Bhaiyya! - Find my Raja! Find my son, bhaiyya! - Don't worry. I'll definitely find Raja. Mr. Rajan... this way! This is the photo of the man who took Raja. He's the same rogue I helped nab, for which I was rewarded. - He's my husband. - What are you saying? - Yes... But Raja doesn't know he's his father. So he found out that we stay here. - That's why he's taken my Raja away. - No, my sister. - He doesn't know Raja is his son either. - No? No! Raja! Raja! - Have courage, sister. - How do I be brave, bhaiyya? He'll surely eke out his revenge on Raja. Trust me, I will bring Raja back. I'll stake my life to bring him back. - May I come in? - Madhu... our Diwali has been ruined. She is my older sister. This is Madhu. I'll meet you later. - I have seen you somewhere. - You look familiar, too. - This... is this yours? - Yes, Rajan gave it to me. It's a memento of his late mother and long-lost brother. Rajan? Long-lost brother? Then they are brothers! - This is a disaster, a disaster! - What happened? - No, not him. - This one? - Not this one. - Raja! Now nobody can harm you. God has offered us sanctuary. I don't want to face Him. Then why does he keep calling me? - Come let's leave. - Where will you go? - Where there is no God. - But God is everywhere. - Come on! Fold your hands. - No! I used to think you a good man, my friend. Son, you don't know the punishments he's inflicted upon me! What are you saying? Can God ever be harsh? Wasn't he harsh when he took my parents away in my childhood? I had a younger brother, he separated us. And soon, we were separated like a broken string of beads. Do you still expect me to pray to Him? I stopped praying to him. He must have been testing you. Mother used to say... that when God loves you, he also tests you. He gives you a few sorrows too. Didn't your mother teach you even this? He took my mother too. I made my own world. I had a wife... I was about to be a father. He snatched them away too. All my life, He's only taken from me... It's good that God didn't give you your son. Or you would have made him exactly like you! - Why? Why don't you speak? - What do I say? - Do you want your child? - Yes. - Do you want your child's mother? - Yes! - Do you want your brother? - Yes, yes. - Then, beg! Then beg. Beg for forgiveness, and he will grant you everything. - Forgiveness? - Why? Are you afraid? God... please forgive him. Give him back his child. - Please give him his child, God, please... - God! God... God, please forgive me. I was mistaken. No one can win against you. God... I committed an offence against you. I am guilty of offences against my wife, my child... my brother, against the whole world. I cannot face you. Won't you forgive me? There's no doubt that there's nothing good about me. And you are without sin. So if you do not forgive me... what's the difference between us? God, he should find his son by morning. Police... police... The voices were coming from here. Where did he disappear so quickly? Let's look elsewhere. - Arre... - I can't go any further. I want to quench my thirst... but there's no water. You're thirsty, aren't you? You want water, right? I'll get you water right away. Jagannath, there's water close by... but you don't know how to quench your thirst. I can quench your thirst. I can bring you your child. But the price remains the same. Two murders. Roshanlal, rather than be a murderer in my son's eyes... it's better I don't find my son at all. I can kill my lifelong hope... but I can't take a human life! - I can't! - You can't? Then I'll have to commit a murder, Jagannath. I regret that it will be yours. - Tell me, Jagannath, will you do as I say? - No! No! - No! - You won't?! [Sounds of fighting, muffled exclamations] - Hey, what're you doing? - What do you...? - Thief, thief! Scoundrel! You wretch! How dare you hit a child! Do as I say or I'll kill the child. When he raised his hand against you... I don't know what happened to me. I couldn't control myself, Raja. Forgive me, Raja. - Roshanlal! - He shot him! Jagan... Nath... - Any news, lnspector Saab? - No. - We got a message saying Jagan committed a murder. - Murder? Yes, murder. The Chief lnspector has ordered... that all police stations in the city be alerted... and all citizens warned. Okay, driver ready? Come on. The criminal Jagannath who has escaped from prison... whose photo has been published in the newpapers... has just committed a murder. He is absconding with an innocent child. That child's life is in danger. The police have requested... that he be watched for at every checkpoint, searched for. The person who nabs him will be rewarded. Look over there! Move! Move out of the way! Come down, Jagan! Move! Move! Out of the way! We can go up the stairs. But all the doors are shut. - Break the doors and go up! - Alright! - Jagan! Jagan, come back! - Don't shoot, lnspector Saab. The child will fall with him. It's his child! - Yes. - Jagan! Your child has been found! - Where's he? - He is with you! He doesn't believe you, lnspector Saab. I'll convince him. I have sworn I'll bring back the child. Wait! Take some help. - Take some men with you. - Then, he will never believe me. Let me go alone, lnspector Saab. Don't follow me! Jagan, don't risk the child's life. Trust me, he is your child. You can't cheat me anymore. Jagan! Why are you after me? I just want to see my child once. Trust me, Jagan, this child is yours. Don't try to deceive me. I am not a murderer anymore! I have accepted my defeat in front of God. God, why are your people following me... why do they want to kill me? Why won't you believe me? How do I believe that your son is mine? This is my sister's son, not mine. He's your child. My sister showed me your photo in the newspaper. She worshipped you. The day she learned that you are a criminal... she fled your life, your house, your world. She was pregnant then... and she didn't want you anywhere near him. This is the police speaking through you. If you need the reward money again... then I promise you, let me find my son. I'll let you catch me again, and you can claim the reward. - Police! - Jagan! - Jagan! - Don't follow me. I've vowed not to kill... My dear wife... - My dear son's mother! - Where's my child? Tell me where he is! Where is he? - Here you are, sister. - Munna! - Here he is. Don't worry. Raja is\n absolutely fine. - Shot? Where have you been shot? - Ln the arm, brother. - Brother? - If I were to die saving one brother from killing the other... - it would be too small a sacrifice. - Brother? Yes, bhaiyya. Bhaiyya! Bhaiyya... Brother! - Bhaiyya! - Bhaiyya... - Bhaiyya! - Promise me... you will never tell my son that I'm his father. Why? Why, bhaiyya, why? Once my fate has been decided... you, members of the respected jury... and you, Judge saheb... and all of you will return... to your homes, where you will hug your children to your bosom... and talk to them lovingly. I'm the only unfortunate person... who will go straight to the gallows. And even in my last moments... I will not be able to address my child as my own. I ask you all... tell me... can there be a greater punishment than this? It's okay. I'm a murderer in the eyes of the world. I've killed. But I'm not a murderer in God's eyes. Or my own. I've taken a life to save a life - of this innocent child... who transformed an atheist into a believer, and a devil into a human being. Today, you can sentence one Jagan to the gallows. Do so. But remember... as long as orphans are treated with hatred... as long as there are no arrangements for their education and upbringing... thousands of lives like mine will end up on the paths of crime... and be destroyed. If, being a good human being... isn't acceptable to my Destiny... I'm happy... to sacrifice my life for the sake of humanity. I am glad to sacrifice my life. I have nothing more to say. Accused Jagannath... the Court and the jury are sympathetic to your testimony. Therefore, on the charge of Roshanlal's murder... the Court acquits you. But on the charge of breaking out of jail... the Court sentences you to two years in prison... that you will serve along with your remaining five years. Sir! Forgive me, my friend. I couldn't find your son. But by the time you come out, I'll surely find your son. - Truly, my friend... - Raja... - call him 'Baba' [father] once. - Why? He didn't find his son, did he? So, you say it. Go on, son. - Baba! - My child! - My child! - Father! I'm handing you my dearest possession. Please forgive me. I've troubled you a lot. Right now, I can give you nothing but my blessings.
