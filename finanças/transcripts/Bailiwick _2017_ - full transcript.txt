You would like me to maybe read fortune? - Oh no, I don't have an-- - I see you have been given this gift. You don't need me to read fortune.

(carnival music) (alarm clock beeping) (light playful music) - Well your sister's fighting again. And I'm like, great, again? - [Young Woman] Of course you had to step in, you know. - Well, that's what little sisters do. They take care of like, the situation. - So did you hit her or? - I don't know. I was just throwing hands. (laughing) Whackin' my hands down whenever. Like, who cares? Like I don't have a day job or anything that's gonna like I have to worry about. - Yeah. - Sorry to keep you waiting. What can I do for ya? (light playful music) (scoffing) (elevator beeping) - So it was, we went to college. You know, you can spare a room and things, you know. - Oh, yeah. - But now he's calling me. - Oh, really? - Yeah, and I just find it weird that he's calling me for stuff like, ooh, donuts. Donuts, cool. I got you, bro. Whoa! Donuts! Donuts! Donuts! Get it, get it, get it! Woo-ho-ho-ho-ho! Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! Aw, man! - I knew I liked this guy. Oh, boy, I like this guy. - Yeah, of course, of course. Oh, that's so good. - You better get in there. - Carbs? No. - [Man] Who? This guy. - [Man] Hey, you want some donuts? Donut guy. - So have you ever tried vegan jerky? - Ooh, jerky. - Try some. - [Brett] Like brothers. - [Ricky] Yeah. - [Brett] The four brothers. - Any, any birthday joke or he was putting on white face paint. - Illuminati. - I've never trusted clowns anyway. - Exactly. And that's the point. You're not supposed to trust them because we know instinctively that they were probably the Illuminati. They're controlling the world. So whenever you hear that clowns are controlling the world, it's actually true. - You ah, you guys want to see a magic trick? - [Ricky] A what? - A what? - What? - Is he new? - Yup. - What? (laughing) - Oh. - Oh. - That's cool. (laughing) - Yes, every king needs his court jester. Take a bow. Really, take a bow. Now show Emily. - Hi, Emily. - Don't be shy, show Emily now. (sighing) (hand slapping) (coin jingling) (laughing) The real trick was making John disappear. (laughing) (playful carnival music) (speaking in foreign language) - [John] The intermediate. (dramatic carnival music) (alarm clock beeping) (light playful music) - Clients can see more of the color spectrons because... - Hey, new guy. - [Man] What are they talking about? Shaquille O'Neal's the only other person I said. Yeah, oh yeah. - So I think I'm gonna win the employee make out contest. I'm makin' out with Kylie. Hey, girl. - Kyle? - Ew, Kylie. Check your hearing aid. - Sorry, sorry, I'm supposed to get a new one next week. - You know about this contest between you and Derek. I'm sensin' a little sexual tension between you two. I think you're tryin' to, tryin' to drop that rainbow sweater and try the D, huh? No? Listen, if Derek's not available, I'm all for representing all the Ds if ah, I could just be there for you. - I too would like to offer up my services, you know, for science. - Aw, thank you, guys. But I've actually tried the D, and that's a hard no. - So wait, though, I just wanna know. The D is freely being given out here? Then is that what's going on? - Slut. - Okay. - [Brett] What's up, dude? - Nice shirt, new guy. - You guys want to see another trick? - [Haylee] Totally. - Sure. - Now, I'm gonna riffle through the cards like this. You tell me when to stop, okay? - Okay. Stop. - So there's your card. Don't show it to me. But you can show it to them. I'm gonna fan these out. You place it back in the deck. Now let's see if I can find her card. Now I'll bet you all anything the next card I turn over is gonna be your card. - I'll take that bet. (laughing) - Not bad. - That's awesome. - Hey, what are you doing tonight? - Going out with us. That's what you're doing. Yeah. - I don't know. - Ah, you'd hate it, anyway. It's gonna be loud and full of a bunch of cheap sluts and booze. Kind of like Billie over here. (laughing) - It's true, though. - It is. - All right, guys, it's that time to hit the grind again. Kyle will be pissed. - Why would Kylie be pissed? - [Co-Workers] Kyle! - [Ricky] Sorry, sorry. Seriously if it wasn't for that concession I would be a Kansas City Chief right now. - See you at the bar. (co-workers chatting in background) (pen scrapping) - [Woman] Melanie, let's go. - Coming.

All right. - [Woman] You have on a beautiful top. - Beautiful. - [Woman] You guys are beautiful. - [Man] You're beautiful people. - Can we keep her? Can I keep her? - I grew a mustache for you too, wanna see? What? Look what you did. You just chased her. - Hey, new guy, new guy! - [All] New guy! - It's ah, actually John. - New guy, actually John.

I hate to tell you this, but Kyle said he wants to see you in the board room. - Yeah, and he said right now, and that's never a good sign. Good luck. - [John] Kyle? - Come on in. Close the door on your way out, Emily. Did you get a call from me last night? - No. - No? You mean I didn't sleepwalk, stumble out of bed, walk over to my pants, grab my phone and call you? - Um... - Um... - No. - Maybe I was hallucinating. Is that what you're saying? - What? - Maybe I was trippin' my balls off. Yeah, I was tripping my balls off and I thought, I'll call that dumb motherfucker who works for me and tell him he can come in late. Is that what happened? (sighing) Is that what happened? - I'm sorry. - You're sorry? For what? It sounds like I had the night of my fucking life, except wait. No, none of that happened. Do you know what did happen, though? What did happen is I went home last night, went to bed early, had boring, obligatory sex with my wife, and then I drank myself to sleep. I did not, however, at any time call you and give you my permission to come in late. Did I? What's that? - No. - No, no. Then what possessed you to think you could come in late? (thudding) (dream-like carnival music) (coughing) - You've got to stop this. I told you no good would come of this. I told you! (coughing) Oh, God. You're killing yourself. Please just stop this. I can't take it anymore! (coughing) Please, just stop. Just, just make it all go away. I always thought you were perfect just the way you were. Please just stop. (coughing) You're sick now, but you'll be okay. (coughing) (dream-like carnival music) (whooshing) (dream-like carnival music) - You think this is about love, support, adoration for one's fellow man.

You can't even imagine yourself as someone who will ever have it. You now have everything you need to have all the power you could ever want. - But there are consequences. Hey. Hey! Hey. Hey, hey.

And all for the price of one of those gin and tonics. Seriously. I'm here if you want to vent. All right, a couple more gin and tonics, Dave.

Is there anyone you can tell? - Not really, no one I know. - Mmm. Can you tell this guy off? I mean, just tell 'em to leave you the hell alone. - No, I can't, I'm-- - Ah, not your style. I can see that. I can tell, you're a nice guy who just wants to keep to yourself, right? And here you got this loser breathing down your neck. Shit, man. That sucks. I'm sorry. You know what? Cheers.

(applauding) - Ah, hey, good job, man. You really knocked 'em dead. (laughing) - Go fly a kite. (slap smacking) - What's up, bro? - Hi. - I need you to fill all these out. - Thank you. - Super tedious, but, you know. - Why don't you do it for me? - New guy. - Hi, John. - So you do know my name. - Of course, you've worked here for like four years. Do you know my name? - Of course, Emily. - Okay. It would seem that some of you need a refresher course on our company's dating policy. Anyone who is employed by me is a no-no. That means to flirting. No to sex. No Netflix and chill. No massage circles. No bootie calls. I want to make sure there is no gray area here. Do we all understand what we can't do with each other? I will make one exception, however, and that's for John. I know you and your hand have been together a long time now and I would really hat to deny true love. (laughing) Am I right? (laughing) - So the way we look at it, if Rick would just stop going to this website, we could probably-- - No, this is the one he told me about, though. - Yeah, but we can-- - Hey, Billie. - Hey, guys.

Back me up on this.

And Emily you've been here for a year, right? - Yeah. - Okay. Well, let's get to it. John, how would you like to run this branch from this point forward? You've got the experience and you're a good, solid person. And I'd like Emily to work alongside you, as well, so that way you could teach her the ropes.

I'm really, really sorry, but the chef just informed me that they're running really low on the eggplant, so I was just wondering if by any chance we can substitute it with some mixed vegetables for your pasta? - [John] Oh, sure, that's fine. - Are you sure?
