SECRET NAME I'll complain to the home that sent you! She's back, that one. Been a long time. Missed streetwalking? Not at all. I was just passing by. Are you free? SEPTEMBER 1914 Join the Red Cross, 18 Rue François Miron! Come join the Red Cross, we need you. That's my spot. My spot, I said. Do you hear me? Move! Get up! Hands off! Leave me alone! We don't want your kind here. Tramp! My book! You're attached to it. Who gave it to you, a man? My mother. Sister, there's no future here. Join us. You'll start as a stretcher bearer or assistant. I'm a hard worker, madam. Don't call me madam. We're sisters. Come. EASTERN FRANCE Nurse! Let's go! Nurse! Over here! That side. My dear beloved, I don't know if my letter will find you. I don't know if you left with the displaced. How is your health? Did you receive the conserves? Mother made them special. I think of you constantly... We found another one. Heat some water for me. I'll stop the bleeding. When are they coming? I can't work without disinfectant. Go look in the other room. In the luggage. There's a dress that should fit you. Thank you. Who is this young person? A voyager, lost on her way. If I sit here, I'll fall asleep. Look. -Smells good. What is it? -I found some barley and an onion. My mother always put lard in her onion soup. Of course, lard... -And a bouquet garni. -Naturally. Where'd it go? -Got any tobacco left? -Let's see. Don't forget the cheese at the end. Get off me! Take that! That'll set you straight! Madwoman! He got me wrong. He took me for a trollop. Rose Juillet. Nélie Laborde. I was traveling with a friend of my father's. We tried to avoid the frontlines, but they moved. Suddenly the Germans appeared. They robbed us, then killed him. I don't know why. I thought they'd kill me. Where's your family? We buried my father two months ago. In Basel, Switzerland. He was all I had left. My only hope is to be taken in by a friend of my father's. An elderly woman. To keep her company and read to her. I have a letter of recommendation. She's a Protestant, like me. -Would you like a bowl of soup? -Yes, please. I've had nothing since morning. When we returned to Switzerland, I knew no one. My father was going to introduce me to polite society. But he soon fell ill. I keep him close always. When the war ends, I'll visit you. -I don't know where I'll be. -No place awaits me. A woman like you must have relations? You know, we're not from the same world. I had a mother. She died. When I was twelve, a childless woman took me in. Thanks to her, I received an education. I learned to read. I have nothing else. Did constant attention from men teach you to defend yourself? What about you? Are you fond of your father's friend? I've never met her. Old people can be cantankerous. But she'll introduce me to society. I hope to marry. If I don't find a new dress, I won't look like much. -What is it? -A warning. They're coming? Don't leave me! Hurry! Go down! -Where are the others? -Where were you? They tried to find you. The ambulance left? Nurse! Miss... Miss... My dear Eléonore, With this letter, I entrust my daughter to you. You alone can help her after I'm gone. I'm asking you to take her in, in remembrance of the friendship Felix and I shared. The thought of you doing this softens my passage to the other world. Where are the other French? I'm alone, with three gravely wounded. -One is your compatriot. -Why are you here? I'm Swiss. I'm on my way to Nancy. -And this young lady? -She's gone, sir. She was killed by one of your shells. Has she been examined by a doctor? The French Army doctor had already left. What will you do with the wounded? We're not barbarians. Was she traveling with you? She was a nurse with the regiment. I'm passing through. Is this your book? Victor Hugo. "Revolutions spring not from accidents but from necessity." You have no business here. We'll give you a transit pass. Name? Your name for the pass? -Rose Juillet. -Rose Juillet... You must make haste. Tomorrow morning, operations resume. He will escort you. Take the refugee route south of here. Come! He will escort you. Take the refugee road, south of here. Let's start with the Good Book. This bible was handed down to me by my father. Mr. André's invoice. Does it include the chestnut and the small pine grove? -Naturally. -That's a relief. Reminds you of your father? Yes. Did he suffer greatly? His body was in pain. But his mind was at peace. Do not be called leaders, for only one is your leader: Christ. The greatest among you shall be your servant. Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled. And whoever is humble shall be exalted. Come sit next to me. Here. Isn't it a bit cold, Massip? Madam doesn't eat enough. Why give all the eggs to the Goulots? They have five growing children. Have you ever tried fresh beef blood? We can get some at the new slaughterhouse. Near the train station. It will strengthen you. You must look after yourself, Madam. I was looking for the library. That way, Miss. Miss? If I may... PICTURESQUE SWITZERLAND... Your room is ready, Miss. -I'll put these away. -Let me, Miss. Mr. Massip wants us in bed early. I must shut the room. Very well. I didn't know. In this dark night which envelops us, the more the spectacle of current events hurts us, the more we must, internally, commit ourselves to justice. The more inhumanity we see around us, the more human we must be. We see nothing but hatred all around. So let us resist. Let us nourish within ourselves the divine that never surrenders. The great sweetness. And the great thirst to love. The more disorder we see, the more order we must create. Care, and scruples, in the smallest of things. As this arrogant brutality grows unabated and tramples on all that is venerable, we must be more respectful in our hearts. As this night of lies darkens around us, we must master the truth. And never surrender an inch of it. That wasn't very clear. In times of war, we mustn't confuse minds. We have to trust our government. Why speak of lies? He spoke well. He appealed to our better natures. He called for sweetness! We were attacked, were we not? Must we let ourselves be killed? No. That wouldn't be right. I think he wanted to tell us not to hate those on the other side. Why shouldn't we hate them? You have no opinion? Because... those fighting on the front are like our own. Reluctant to fight, and afraid. They pray every day to go home. For the war to end. I could be wrong. No need to blush. You have a very good mind. Julien often gets carried away. You know... he may be my nephew, but I remain critical. Perhaps you resemble him more than you think. Me, resemble that socialist? Well, you both have independent minds. Forks this way. Turned over. Turned over too. Your mother must've played this for you. It's a classic! Hello, Aunt. I'm hungry. Be seated. I'm so pleased to meet the reader my aunt raves about. Your sermons make me think. I try to provide food for thought. What does it mean when Jesus says, "I did not come to bring peace, but a sword." I don't know what to think of the woes of this war. We should be amazed that kindness still exists in this world. What is it? I'm sorry. It's almost ready. -Have you news from the front? -Alas, no. Official statements have replaced journalism. Imagine a retired officer amputating and sugarcoating texts to boost the morale of the population. If it weren't for the newspapers, the war would probably be long over. They alone are responsible for this carnage. You surprise me. Being in the newspaper makes people feel important. From simple subordinates to leaders of nations, they'll do anything to get in the newspaper. That would make an original article. So, Miss... tell us about your Swiss mountains. Are their eyes blue, as Lamartine said? I see the mountains as blind. All that whiteness. Could you see them from your window? What I saw... was the Rhine. Tell us about the Rhine. I love the great rivers. The Rhine... is impetuous, temperamental. It is swift. Difficult for fishermen. Its banks are unstable. Washerwomen must walk a long way to find the quieter coves. Do you miss your friends? Our neighbors were lovely. A woman and her husband. They were childless. Their door was always open to me. Do you know how they say "parasol" there? Julien's never been to Switzerland. Well... the word is the same, but they say "barisol." -And "burse" for "purse." -Yes. What are we having? A potage of carrot greens. A "botage," you mean. -Madam... -No, no. This. This we can eat. This? Common thistle. The leaf is remarkable, isn't it? We should draw it. I'll ask Honorine to pick some. How do you know all this? I learned from a countrywoman. When my father and I were in Sicily. Sicily? I didn't know your father was posted there. What a life you've had! They danceLa Tarantella . You know? I have a book of engravings that shows precisely that pose. Beautiful. Faraway places. Emilienne! Have you eaten? Oh yes! Are you pregnant? Miss, I beg you... Don't worry, I won't tell. It mustn't cost you your job. My sister told me to purge it. But I'm scared. I know a girl who died. You know, these people will run you off. Be wary of their kind faces. And I haven't been here long. Think it over. Count only on yourself. The knitting for our soldiers... -But I didn't do anything! -You didn't do anything? I trusted you. -I learned my lesson, Madam. -What lesson? Do you realize the situation you put yourself in? You pretend not to understand. I told you: no visitors in your room. Least of all your suitors. -I understand, Madam. -Apologize, Emilienne. -Madam, I will never... -It's too late. Once someone has lied, we never know where the lie ends. For us, once trust is broken, we can no longer live together. We simply can't. Whenever I looked at you, I'd wonder if you were hiding something. Do you understand? Honorine knows what I mean. I've looked her in the eyes for forty years. Never once have I felt she had something to hide. I'm worried about you. You're carrying a life. I'll tell my nephew at the church. He'll find you another position. Emilienne... Here. The address of a home for women. -They'll help you. -Even with your child. Thank you, Miss. I only hope it's not a girl. We're born to suffer. Come on, pick up the pace a bit! They'll be here any minute. Etienne, could you move the tray, please? Put it... on the chair where it was earlier. -I'll see you tomorrow. -What? The guests will soon arrive. Go get changed, hurry. If you don't mind, I'd rather exclude myself. I will not allow it. You are one of us. I want to introduce you. They're my friends. There's a surprise in your room. -Got you, dirty Boche! -Mercy! My Jojo! Take your seats. Séverine is about to sing. Children, go make war upstairs. Séverine is about to sing. Run along now. -Children, look what I brought you! -Madeleines! Thank you, my dear Séverine, for charming us with music. And thank you, Léon. My friends, I'd like to share the joy I've had lately, rereading Villiers de l'Isle Adam. If I dared, I'd ask Rose to give us the pleasure. Rose, would you? Please. Go on. "Tale of Love" Bedazzlement. Night, over the great mystery, unfurls its blue curtains. As many flowers on the Earth as stars in the heavens. I lost the gloomy ocean. Its grief, its waves, its echoes. Anything at all, do tell: Give me the rumor of a swell. Heavy with sorrow, bereft, I dream of suns long gone. O bury me in your pale breast! Give me a night of calm. Presence. If some evening you incite the secret of my heart forlorn, to please you, I will recite a very ancient poem. If you speak to me of torment, of hopes dashed, I will pick for you... What are you doing? You mustn't get up. Stay calm. Who is this woman, Rose? The nurse who took me in. She died before my eyes. She won't get near you. Now, be reasonable. I beg you. Get some rest. Madam. You're my only hope. On his deathbed, my father said you would give me kindness and protection. Who was your father? Captain Juillet, your husband's friend. Julien, I don't understand what this person is saying. Everything was stolen. My papers, his letter, my locket. I left the hospital and crossed the frontlines to get here. Only to find her in my place. This young lady, who is Swiss, tells me she came to France in autumn. Near the front, she was injured in a shelling. She says a nurse by the name of... Nélie Laborde stole her papers and clothing during a German attack. You will find no nurse here. Check with the Red Cross. -She's here, I saw her. -You must be mistaken. You surely need rest. You were gravely wounded. I woke up from a catalepsy. I was in a German hospital in Mulhouse. They treated me. What do you mean by "catalepsy?" When I was injured, I was alone with nurse Nélie Laborde. She must've thought I was dead. Nélie Laborde had nowhere to go. She took my papers and my locket. Now I have proof, for she is here. What are you saying? I'm telling you I'm Rose Juillet. Your wound must've altered your good sense. Or else you made it all up, to profit from Madam de Lengwil's generosity. Let's hear her out. Is there anyone in Nancy who could confirm your identity? I know no one here. I appeal to your Christian charity. Swiss acquaintances will vouch for me. -I know no one in Switzerland now. -Sir, help me. What would this Nélie Laborde have done with your papers? You know what she's done, she came here! I've heard enough. Julien. Madam de Lengwil! Please. The woman who was reading earlier. Did she come here with my father's letter? Do you realize your question is an affront to my judgement? -And an affront to Rose. -But I'm Rose! You owe respect to the mistress of the house. Let me see that nurse. Let her say her name to my face! Take her away! Where is she? Let me confront her! Madam de Lengwil! Let me go! Rose? Yes. Rose? Yes? Sleep well, my child. Julien? Coming, Aunt. So, what did you do with her? I put her in a room at the church. She's penniless. Is she still delusional? She asked for my help. And I agreed. You're sheltering a madwoman against my wishes? Listen to what I'm saying. We must understand before we condemn her. Your taste for paradox is getting absurd. There's just one missing link. The Red Cross will provide it. -Madam! -Yes. I'm looking for a woman Pastor Valence has taken in. She's upstairs. Prays there every morning. Thank you. Would you mind taking her this? The others are waiting. We're doing our rounds. I never meant you any harm. I saw a dead woman. But you're alive. Your suffering is unbearable to me. These are my savings. Since I began serving Madam de Lengwil. -They're yours. -Give me back my name. Wait. I promise to give you money every month. You'll find a good position. I'll recommend you. I know a woman who could help you. You, recommend me? A girl like you? If you wish to make amends, tell Madam de Lengwil everything. In front of everyone. Confess your vile act. Show your true face. -You know that means prison for me. -You deserve it. -And then the streets. -Your rightful place. In any case, you'll never be like us. And Madam de Lengwil would be heartbroken. She's fond of me. You prefer to fool her? Be quiet. I'm turning you in to the police. -You wouldn't. -I'll have a sergeant drag you out. I want my place. The one you took from me. Think you can abuse Madam de Lengwil and bewitch the local gentlemen? I'll open their eyes to the kind of woman they have under their roof. Sister, I must speak to you. -What's this? -Please. -Sister, listen... -No eating here. The service will soon begin. -I wanted to say... -Not now, my child. The choir is coming. There they are. Come with us. Music soothes the heart. We'll speak later. They will soon know who you are. And who are you? A madwoman from a German hospital. Come to create a scandal. I was taught one thing in life. Never bite the hand that feeds you. I simply took a path that opened to me. I'll write to the newspapers. -I'll tell them who Nélie Laborde is. -I know no Nélie Laborde. She exists only in your mind. This is my protégée. Rose. This is Captain Fontaine. May I ask you some questions, Miss? Can you tell us where, and how it happened? I was at church to give a reading lesson when she appeared. I had no time to react. How did she appear? I don't remember. Suddenly she was there. -No one else was there? -Not a soul. -Except for a deaconess. -Why did you go out alone? Massip or Etienne could've taken you. So, she appeared and then, she stood facing you? -Or attacked from the side? -From the front. It happened so fast. Strange she struck you on that side. It's not natural. What was her intention? To cut off your ear? Slit your throat? After she struck you, what did she do? Must she retell this painful story? I told you everything. Madam, I need the statement from her. I believe you took notes when you and I spoke. Have her read them and sign them. We must prevent that criminal from causing harm. Procedure requires me to hear both parties. Both parties? You equate Rose with that woman who made a scene in my home? Who attacked my reader at church? Must she kill her, for our complaint to be heard? In that case, I'll read out loud the notes I took. Correct me if need be, Miss. When were you named police chief in Nancy? Three months ago, Madam. You didn't answer me. How can we prevent that woman from causing more harm? According to procedure, first we'll interrogate her. She'll say whatever she likes. -Then she'll be taken into custody. -As she should. So a psychiatrist can examine her. From what you told me, she may be delusional. If proved insane, she will be committed. We will not let her run free, I assure you. Good. Have some more tea. No. Where do I sign? Please read it attentively before signing. Is everything accurate? Yes. Tell my why! -Is Miss Rose asleep yet? -No, Madam. -You wish to see her? -Yes. Come sit with me. Your mother never handed down any jewels? My mother had no jewels. True, some Protestants refuse jewels. That gives them too much importance. I got this from my mother. This way I'll always be near you. Would you love me if... my mother was a washerwoman? You have so much imagination! It makes you a precious reader. Could you please close the curtains? Yes. What is it? A bird. Silly me, I was frightened. I'll get it, Etienne. Hello. A letter for Madam de Lengwil. From the pastor. Marthe! Come see. My dear Aunt, good news. I learned that Nélie Laborde was working for Dr. Clarinval, head of ambulances for the 201st regiment until she disappeared. Marthe? Madam wants some water. Luck is with us. Apparently the good doctor, wounded at the front, has been transferred to a Paris hospital. I will go to Paris to meet him. Meanwhile, do not entrust important matters to your dear reader. Your devoted Julien. Monsieur the Director, since I arrived here, I can no longer sleep or eat. I fear I will let myself die if you do not come to my aid. I no longer have family to affirm I am neither a criminal nor insane. I implore you, on my honor, to believe me. I am the victim of a heinous identity theft. While I languish here, this woman, whose name is Nélie Laborde, is stealing my life. Each day, I draw on my waning strength to remain standing until justice is served. Sir, you are my last and only hope. Monsieur the Director of the Asylum. That's right. The chairs. I'll handle the geraniums. Careful. It's heavy. It's time for our reading. Careful of the orange tree. I don't like the arrival of winter. I usually spend August with cousins in the mountains, but... this year, perhaps the seaside. Would you come with me? That's why I mention it. August is far away. And with the war... You don't seem very enthused. It's just... I'm not sure I can remain in your service. Why not? If you have other plans, tell me. -I don't like being caught off guard. -I have no other plans. Aren't you happy here? Yes. Yes. -I'm not well... -Eléonore? Call a doctor. A doctor? I need a bleeding. Eléonore! Shall I call a doctor? She can't wait. She needs a bleeding. But... The doctor was reassuring. You'll be fine, Madam. I remember nothing. What happened? You were given a bleeding. It saved your life. He prescribed sugar to fortify you. And bouillon for three days. Miss Rose will give it to you. Let's take one more. Wait. Miss Rose? I've just seen my aunt. She's doing better. Thank God. That task requires strength. -You think we lack strength, Mr. Julien? -Certainly not. I said I'd dig up the leeks. Miss Rose insisted on helping me. I said I didn't want her wrecking her hands. It must be said, she has a good grip. There we go. Rose, can I see you in private? I found the major who Nélie Laborde assisted at the front. Doctor Clarinval. He's been seriously wounded. If it wasn't urgent, I wouldn't have bothered you, Dr. Clarinval. Could you describe Nélie Laborde, your nurse? Brunette, slim waist... a pleasant face. Very brave. I last saw her at the miller's house. What is it? She was hit by a shell, soon after you left. I thought she'd been killed. We saved the wounded who could travel. She survived. If she's alive, you must notify the Red Cross. And the woman who was traveling from Switzerland? Could you describe her? My memory of her isn't clear. A person of quality. She was slender and also a brunette. Could you hand me my pipe? And be so kind as to light it? And... did the nurse have a scar on her palm? What do you mean? My pipe. The nurse. Was her right palm scarred? Once I asked her to help me treat my foot. I saw her hands. They were perfect. The woman who kicked up a fuss is indeed Nélie Laborde. You're the last person she saw before the shelling. Her head injury made her lose her bearings. She's convinced her name is Rose Juillet. She believes she is you. And you are her. Poor woman. I owe you an apology. My aunt trusts you completely. Whereas I... wanted to be sure. Out of consideration for a lost soul, I wanted to keep a cool head. I don't know why. Will you forgive me? The director will see me? I've been waiting for days. Calm down. We're not seeing the director. Follow me. No. Come on. Rebelling? Robert! "Go away," said Jean Valjean. "Sir," said the child, "give me back my coin." Jean Valjean looked down and said nothing. The child said it again. "My coin, sir." Jean Valjean stared at the ground. "My coin!" cried the child. "My silver coin. My money." It seemed Jean Valjean couldn't hear. What's the matter? Tell me your sorrows. Don't keep them inside. Let your tears fall. -Heating more water? -For Miss Rose. -Still too hot. -We'll take the laundry down first. Marthe? Marthe? Marthe? Do you have the water? Help! Are you hurt? No, are you? Honorine! Here. Go to bed. You'll fetch the pastor in the morning. Very well. Hold this. Ever shot a rifle? We can't shoot a woman. We'll see. Move! I just caught her. Coming out of a thicket. -Where shall I put her? -In the kitchen. I'll awaken my aunt. Massip. Julien, Massip... -Hand her over to the police. -Madam! We found this cape in the cellar. That liar! Take her away. Let me go! I have rights! Come. Let me go! I have rights! -Come. -I have rights! Let her go! I can explain who Nélie Laborde is. Rose... I believed you were dead. I burnt my hand putting your locket in the fire. I'm the daughter of a washerwoman. Father unknown. My name is Nélie Laborde. Madam... Your trust in me was an honor. Sir... I will never forget your kindness. I come from the streets. I stole to eat, and I did worse. I simply wanted to change my life. I liked living with you. Madam wishes to see you. I'll take her. Be seated. Madam, are you quite sure? Miss, does your ankle hurt? No, Madam. The poultice helps me greatly. I'm glad. Can you walk? Very nearly, Madam. Do you now see that I was wronged? I see you as a person in difficulty. My father was Gustave Juillet. I was born on January 21, 1892 in Lausanne. No one will dispute that. But I no longer need a reader. And I wish to help you, within my means. I presume your financial situation is precarious. And that a little monetary aid, tactfully offered, would be welcome. Hush money? To set yourself up... you'll need more than the equivalent of a year's salary. You don't want justice done? Two years won't suffice either. -I cannot accept this. -So let's say... Five years' salary. And I won't press charges for last night's aggression. My father thought you were a friend. I understand your disappointment. For the first time in my life, perhaps, I lacked discernment. I thought my head was guiding me. But my heart held the reins. Where can I go? You'll find your way, I'm certain. You have the will. To the train station. I want to see Paris. My dear Aunt, I had no time to tell you. I'm leaving tonight to join the 52nd Infantry Regiment. I decided not to wait to be called up. Don't worry about me. Julien. 3rd Class Passage Le Havre-New York Where are you going? I'll take you. -I have a train for Le Havre. -Get in. Let's go, Massip. The car has been requisitioned. Massip will turn it over when we're back. The war affects everyone. I let you down, didn't I? There are blows we think we can't recover from. And then... comes the true blow. For me, it came when I realized you were gone. As a child, I'd have given anything for my mother to hold me. In her arms. As I saw other mothers do. And yet, I knew she loved me. One day, she looked at me in a special way. She looked at my dress, tattered and resewn, and said, "We'll get you a new dress made." She took the meager savings she kept in a box and took me to the department store. Maybe there is such a thing as fate. You can't change your life. Come back with me. You know I can no longer live with you. Your social circle would never forgive me. They'd cast you out, too. I've always dreamed of leaving the North. I could move to Italy, by the sea. There'd be a room for you. You'd be free to come and go. No one would know you. You could read to me from time to time. Once the war is over. Before you left... I had adoption papers drawn up. If you like, you could be my daughter. You'd bear my name. I understand your surprise. No need to decide now. You have the whole trip. Laborde was my mother's name. It's my name. I want to bear it. One can bear several names. Things are so fragile, we mustn't destroy them. Can't you see we're here, together? Nélie.
