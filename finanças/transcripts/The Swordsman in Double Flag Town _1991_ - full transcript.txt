What's the big deal? The art of your father's swordsmanship has never been seen in books In the past years he defeated countless famous swordsmen He was well recognized in the Northwest His swordart absorbed the essence of fist and palm boxing To laymen, his technique looked very simple It had neither fancy maneuvers nor a life-threatening whistle But a professional swordsman understand its deadly strokes Most important part is when he unsheathes his sword for his last deadly stroke The sword carries his breathing strength, which in turn pushes the sword You can't tell when the sword is out of the sheathe, and when its tip stabs into the enemy's flesh This swiftness all depends on one's breathing strength Without it, it is impossible to perform this maneuver Even if you want to learn, you are not able to Haomei, Haige.
