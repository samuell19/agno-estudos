[light classical music] [waves ebb and flow] [calm flute and harp music] To sing a song that old was sung, from ashes ancient Gower is come. Assuming man's infirmities, to glad your ear, and please your eyes. It hath been sung at festivals, on ember-eves and holidays And lords and ladies in their lives have read it for restoratives. The purchase is to make men glorious; Et bonum quo antiquius, eo melius. If you, born in these latter times, when wit's more ripe, accept my rhymes. And that to hear an old man sing will to your wishes pleasure bring, I, life would wish, and that I might waste it for you, like taper-light. This Antioch, then, Antiochus the Great built up, this city, for his chiefest seat, the fairest in all Syria, I tell you what mine authors say. This king unto him took a pere, who died and left a female heir, so buxom, blithe, and full of face, as heaven had lent her all his grace; With whom the father liking took, And her to incest did provoke. Bad child, worse father! To entice his own to evil should be done by none. But custom what they did begin was with long use accounted no sin. The beauty of this sinful dame made many princes thither frame, to seek her as a bed-fellow, in marriage, pleasures, play-fellow. Which to prevent he made a law to keep her still and men in awe, that who so asked her for his wife, his riddle told not, lost his life. So for her many a wight did die, as yon grim looks do testify. What now ensues, to the judgment of your eye I give, my cause who best can justify. Young prince of Tyre, you have at large received the danger of the task you undertake. I have, Antiochus, and, with a soul emboldened with the glory of her praise, think death no hazard in this enterprise. Music! Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride, for the embracements even of Jove himself, At whose conception, till Lucina reigned, nature this dowry gave, to glad her presence, the senate-house of planets all did sit, to knit in her their best perfections. -[arabic music] -See where she comes, appareled like the spring, graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king of every virtue gives renown to men! Her face, the book of praises, where is read nothing but curious pleasures, as from thence sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath could never be her mild companion. You gods that made me man, and sway in love, that have inflamed desire in my breast to taste the fruit of yon celestial tree, or die in the adventure, be my helps, as I am son and servant to your will, to compass such a boundless happiness! Prince Pericles, [chuckles] That would be son to great Antiochus. Before thee stands this fair Hesperides, with golden fruit, yet dangerous to be touched. For death-like dragons here affright thee hard. Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view her countless glory, which desert must gain. And which, without desert, because thine eye presumes to reach, all the whole heap must die. Yon sometime famous princes, like thyself, drawn by report, adventurous by desire, tell thee with speechless tongues and semblance pale, that without covering, save yon field of stars, here they stand, martyrs, slain in Cupid's wars. And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist for going on death's net, whom none resist. Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught my frail mortality to know itself. And by those fearful objects, to prepare this body, like to them, to what I must. For death remembered should be like a mirror, who tells us life's but breath, to trust it error. I'll make my will then, and as sick men do who know the world, see heaven, but, feeling woe, gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did. So I bequeath a happy peace to you and all good men, as every prince should do. My riches to the earth from whence they came. But my unspotted fire of love, to you. Thus ready for the way of life or death, I wait the sharpest blow, Antiochus. Scorning advice, read the conclusion then. Which read and not expounded, 'tis decreed, like these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed. Of all said yet, mayst thou prove prosperous! Of all said yet, I wish thee happiness! Like a bold champion, I assume the lists, nor ask advice of any other thought but faithfulness, and courage. I'm no viper, yet I feed on mother's flesh which did me breed. I sought a husband, in which labor I found that kindness in a father. He's father, son, and husband mild; I mother, wife, and yet his child. How this may be, and yet in two, as you will live, resolve it you. Sharp physic is the last, but, oh you powers that give heaven countless eyes to view men's acts, why cloud they not their sights perpetually if this be true which makes me pale to read it? [mystical music] Fair glass of light, I loved you, and could still were not this glorious casket stored with ill. But I must tell you now my thoughts revolt, for he's no man on whom perfections wait that knowing sin within, will touch the gate. You are a fair viol, and your sense the strings who fingered to make man his lawful music would draw heaven down and all the gods to hearken. But being played upon before your time, hell only danceth at so harsh a chime. Good sooth, I care not for you. Prince Pericles touch not upon my life for that's an article within our law as dangerous as the rest. Your time's expired. Either expound now, or receive your sentence. Great king, few love to hear the sins they love to act. It would braid yourself too near for me to tell it. Who has a book of all that monarchs do, he's more secure to keep it shut than shown. For vice repeated is like the wandering wind. Blows dust in other's eyes, to spread itself, and yet the end of all is bought thus dear. The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear to stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts Copped hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is thronged by man's oppression, and the poor worm doth die for it. Kings are earth's gods, in vice their law's their will, and if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill? It is enough you know, and it is fit, what being more known grows worse to smother it. All love the womb that their first being bred, then give my tongue like leave to love my head. Would that I had thy head, he hath found the meaning. I will gloze with him. Young prince of Tyre, though by the tenor of our strict edict, your exposition misinterpreting we might proceed to cancel of your days. Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a tree as your fair self, doth tune us otherwise. Forty days longer we do respite you, if by which time our secret be undone, this mercy shows we'll joy in such a son. And until then your entertain shall be as doth befit our honor and your worth. How courtesy would seem to cover sin, when what is done is like an hypocrite, the which is good in nothing but in sight! If it be true that I interpret false, then were it certain you were not so bad as with foul incest to abuse your soul. Where now, you're both a father and a son, by your uncomely claspings with your child, which pleasure fits a husband, not a father! And she, an eater of her mother's flesh by the defiling of her parent's bed. And both like serpents are, who though they feed on sweetest flowers yet they poison breed. Antioch, farewell! For wisdom sees, those men blush not in actions blacker than the night will shun no course to keep them from the light. One sin, I know, another doth provoke, murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke. Poison and treason are the hands of sin, aye and the targets, to put off the shame. Then lest my life be cropped to keep you clear, by flight I'll shun the danger which I fear. He hath found the meaning, for the which I mean to have his head. He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy, nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin, in such a loathed manner. And therefore instantly this prince must die. For by his fall, my honor must keep high. Who attends us there? Doth your highness call? Thaliard, you are of our chamber, Thaliard. And our mind partakes her private actions to your secrecy. And for your faithfulness we will advance you, Thaliard. Behold, here's poison, and here's gold. We hate the Prince of Tyre, and thou must kill him. It fits thee not to ask the reason why because we bid it, say, is it done? My lord, tis' done. -[door bangs] -Enough Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste. My Lord, Prince Pericles is fled. As thou wilt live, fly after! And like an arrow shot from a well-experienced archer hits the mark his eye doth level at, so thou never return unless thou say, Prince Pericles is dead. My lord, if I can get him within my pistol's length, I'll make him sure enough, so farewell to your highness. Thaliard, adieu. Till Pericles be dead, my heart can lend no succor to my head. [reedy classical music] Let none disturb us! [curtains swoosh] Why should this change of thoughts. The sad companion, dull-eyed melancholy, be my so used a guest as not an hour in the day's glorious walk, or peaceful night, the tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet! Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them. And danger, which I feared is at Antioch, whose arm seems far too short to hit me here. Yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits, nor yet the other's distance comfort me. Then it is thus, the passions of the mind that have their first conception by misdread, have after nourishment and life by care. And what was first but fear what might be done, grows elder now and cares it be not done. And so with me, the great Antiochus against whom I am too little to contend since he's so great can make his will his act. will think me speaking, though I swear to silence. Nor boots it me to say I honor him if he suspect I may dishonor him. And what may make him blush in being known, he'll stop the course by which it might be known. With hostile forces he'll overspread the land, And with the ostent of war will look so huge, amazement shall drive courage from the state, our men be vanquished ere they do resist, and subjects punished that ne'er thought offense. Which care of them, not pity of myself, who am no more but as the tops of trees, that fence the roots they grow by and defend them. Makes both my body pine and soul to languish. And punish that before, that he would punish. [curtains swoosh] Joy and all comfort in your sacred breast! And keep your mind peaceful and comfortable. Peace, peace, and give experience tongue. They do abuse the king that flatter him, for flattery is the bellows blows up sin whereas reproof, obedient and in order fits kings as they are men for they may err. When Signor Sooth here does proclaim a peace he flatters you, makes war upon your life. Prince pardon me or strike me if you please, I cannot be much lower than my knees. All leave us else, but let your cares overlook what shipping and what lading's in our haven and then return to us. Helicanus, thou hast moved us. What seest thou in our looks? An angry brow, dread lord. If there be such a dart in princes' frowns, how durst thy tongue move anger to our face? How dares the plants look up to heaven, from whence they have their nourishment? Thou know'st I have power to take thy life from thee. I have ground the Axe myself, do you but strike the blow. [Pericles chuckles] Rise, prithee, rise, sit down. Thou art no flatterer I thank thee for it. And heaven forbid that kings should let their ears hear their faults hid. Fit counselor and servant to a prince, who by thy wisdom makes a prince thy servant, what wouldst thou have me do? To bear with patience such griefs as you do lay upon yourself. Thou speaks like a physician Helicanus, that ministers a potion unto me that thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself. Attend me then, I went to Antioch, where as thou know'st against the face of death I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty. From whence an issue I might propagate her arms to princes, and bring joys to subjects. Her face was to mine eye, beyond all wonder. The rest, hark in thine ear, as black as incest. Which by my knowledge found the sinful father seemed not to strike but smooth, but thou know'st this. 'Tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss. Which fear so grew in me I hither fled under the covering of a careful night, who seemed my good protector, and being here, bethought me what was past what might succeed. I knew him tyrannous, and tyrants' fears decrease not but grow faster than the years. And should he doubt, as doubt no doubt he doth, that I should open to the listening air how many worthy princes' bloods were shed, to keep his bed of blackness unlaid open, to lop that doubt, he'll fill this land with arms, and make pretense of wrong that I have done him when all for mine, if I may call it offense, must feel war's blow, who spares not innocence. Which love to all, of which thyself art one who now -reproves me for it-- -Alas Sir! Drew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my cheeks, musings into my mind with thousand doubts how I might stop this tempest ere it came. And finding little comfort to relieve them I thought it princely charity to grieve for them. Well, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak, freely will I speak. Antiochus you fear, and justly too, I think you fear the tyrant, who either by public war or private treason will take away your life. Therefore my lord, go travel for a while, till that his rage and anger be forgot, or till the destinies do cut his thread of life. Your rule direct to any, if to me. Day serves not light more faithful than I'll be. I do not doubt thy faith, but should he wrong my liberties in my absence? We'll mingle our bloods together in the earth, from whence we had our being and our birth. Tyre, I now look from thee then, and towards Tarsus intend my travel, where I'll hear from thee and by whose letters I'll dispose myself. The care I had and have of subjects' good on thee I lay whose wisdom's strength can bear it. I'll take thy word for faith, not ask for oath. Who shuns not to break one will sure crack both. But in our orbs we'll live so round and safe. The time of both this truth shall ne'er convince, thou show'dst a subject's shine, I a true prince. [sweet classical music] [cymbals clang] So, this is Tyre, and this the court. [door creaks] Here must I kill King Pericles, and if I do it not, I am sure to be hanged at home. 'Tis dangerous. Well, I perceive he was a wise fellow, and had good discretion, being bid to ask what he would of the King, desired he might know none of his secrets. Now do I see he had some reason for it, for if a King bid a man be a villain, he's bound by the indenture of his oath to be one! Hush, here come the lords of Tyre. You shall not need, my fellow peers of Tyre further to question of your King's departure. His sealed commission left in trust with me doth speak sufficiently he's gone, to travel. How? The King gone? If further yet you will be satisfied, why as it were unlicensed of your loves he would depart, I'll give some light unto you. Being at Antioch, What from Antioch? Royal Antiochus, on what cause I know not took some displeasure at him, at least he judged so. And doubting lest that he had erred or sinned to show his sorrow, he'd correct himself. So puts himself unto the ship man's toil, with whom each minute threatens life or death. Well, I perceive I shall not be hanged now. But since he's gone, the King's ears it must please, He escaped the land, to perish at the seas, I'll present myself. Peace to the lords of Tyre! [shoes shuffle] Lord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome. From him I come, with message unto princely Pericles. But since my landing I have understood your lord has betook himself to unknown travels. My message must return from whence it came. We have no reason to desire it, commended to our master, not to us, yet, ere you shall return, this we desire. As friends to Antioch, we may feast in Tyre. [dissonant classical music] My Dionyza, shall we rest us here? And by relating tales of others' griefs, see if 'twill teach us to forget our own? That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it. For who digs hills because they do aspire throws down one mountain to cast up a higher. Oh my distressed lord, even such our griefs are, here they're but felt and seen with mischief's eyes, but like two groves being topped, they higher rise. Oh Dionyza, who wanteth food and will not say he wants it? Or can conceal his hunger till he famish? Our tongues and sorrows force us to sound deeper our woes into the air our eyes do weep! Till lungs fetch breath that may proclaim them louder, that if heaven slumber while their creatures want, they may awake their helps to comfort them. I'll then discourse our woes, felt several years, and wanting breath to speak, help me with tears. I'll do my best, sir. This Tarsus, o'er which I have the government, city on whom plenty held full hand, for riches strewed herself even in the streets. Whose towers bore heads so high they kissed the clouds. And strangers ne'er beheld but wondered at, whose men and dames so jetted and adorned like one another's glass to trim them by. Their tables were stored full to glad the sight, and not so much to feed on as delight! All poverty was scorned, and pride so great, the name of help grew odious to repeat. Oh, 'tis too true. But see what heavens can do by this our change. Those mouths, which would have laid, earth, sea, and air, were all too little to content and please, although they gave their creatures in abundance, as houses are defiled for want of use they are now starved for want of exercise. Those palates which were not yet two summers younger must have inventions to delight the taste, would now be glad of bread and beg for it! Those mothers who don nousle up their babes thought nought too curious, are ready now to eat those little darlings whom they loved. So sharp are hunger's teeth that man and wife draw lots, who first shall die to lengthen life. Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping. Here many sink, yet those which see them fall have scarce strength left to give them burial. Is not this true? Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it. Oh, let those cities that of plenty's cup and her prosperities so largely taste with their superfluous riots,[weeping] hear these tears! The misery of Tarsus may be theirs. Where's the lord governor? Here, speak out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste, for comfort is too far for us to expect. We have descried upon our neighboring shore, aportly sail of ships make hitherward. [chuckles] I thought as much. One sorrow never comes but brings an heir, that may succeed as his inheritor, and so in ours, some neighboring nation taking advantage of our misery, hath stuffed their hollow vessels with their powers, to beat us down, the which are down already. And make a, conquest of unhappy me [weeping]. That's the least fear for by the semblance of their white flags displayed, they bring us peace! And come to us as favorers, not as foes. Thou speaks like him so untutored to repeat, who makes the fairest show means most deceit. But bring they what they will and what they can, what need we fear? I'm ground's the lowest, and we are half way there. Go tell their general we await him here to know for what he comes, and whence he comes, and what he craves. I go, my lord. Welcome is peace, if he on peace consist, if wars, we are unable to resist. [jubilant trumpet] Lord governor, for so we hear you are. Let not our ships and number of our men be like a beacon fired to amaze your eyes. We've heard your miseries as far as Tyre, and seen the desolation of your streets. Nor come we to add sorrow to your hearts, but to relieve them of their heavy load. And these our ships, you happily may think are like the Trojan horse was stuffed within with bloody veins expecting overthrow, are stored with corn to make your needy bread, and give them life whom hunger starved half dead. The gods of Greece protect you! And we'll pray for you. Arise. I pray you, rise. We do not look for reverence, but for love, and harborage for ourself, our ships and men. The which when any shall not gratify, or pay you with unthankfulness in thought. Be it our wives, our children, or ourselves. The curse of heaven and men succeed their evils! Till when, the which I hope shall never be seen, your grace is welcome to our town and us. Which welcome we'll accept, feast here awhile, until our stars that frown lend us a smile. [joyous classical music] Here have you seen a mighty king, his child I wis to incest bring. A better prince and benign lord, who will prove awful both in deed and word. Be quiet then as men should be, till he hath passed necessity. I'll show you those in troubles reign, losing a mite, a mountain gain. The good in conversation to whom I give my benison, is still at Tarsus, where each man thinks all is writ he spoken can. And remember what he does build his statue, to make him glorious. But to tidings to the contrary are brought your eyes, -[somber classical music] -what need speak I? Good Helicane hath stayed at home, not to eat honey like a drone from others' labors, but doth strive to killen bad, keep good alive. And to fulfill his prince's desire, sends word of all that haps in Tyre. How Thaliard came full bent with sin and he'd intent to murder him. And that in Tarsus was not best, longer for him to make his rest. -He doing so, -[footsteps thumping] put forth to seas, where when men been, there's seldom ease. For now the wind begins to blow, thunder above and deeps below make such unquiet, that the ship should house him safe is wrecked and split. And he good prince, having all lost, by waves from coast to coast is tost, all perishen of man, of pelf, ne aught escapen, but himself. Till fortune, tired of doing bad, threw him ashore to give him glad. And here he come, what shall be next, pardon old Gower, this longs the text. [thunder rumbles] Et cease your ire you angry stars of heaven! Wind, rain, and thunder, remember, earthly man is but a substance that must yield to you. And I as fits my nature, do obey you. [thunder rumbles] Alas, the sea hath cast me on the rocks.[breathing heavily] Washed me from shore to shore, and left me breath nothing to think on but ensuing death. Let it suffice the greatness of your powers to have bereft a prince of all his fortunes. And having thrown him from your watery grave, here, to have death in peace, [breathing heavily] is all he'll crave. [man shouts] [First Fisherman] What, ho, Pilch! [ Second Fisherman] Ha! Come and bring away the nets! [First Fisherman] What, Patch-breech, I say! [Third Fisherman] What say you, master? Look how thou stirrest now! Come away, or I'll fetch for you the wanion. Faith, master! I am thinking of the poor men that were cast away before us even now. Well alas poor souls, it grieved my heart to hear what pitiest cries they made for us to help them when well-a-day we could scarce help ourselves. Nay master said not I as much when I saw the porpus how he bounced and tumbled? [fisherman with white grunts] They say they're half fish, half flesh, a plague on them, they ne'er come but I look to be washed. Master, I marvel how the fishes live in the sea. Why, as men do a-land. The great ones eat up the little ones. [fisherman with long hair grunts] I can compare your rich misers to nothing so fitly as to a whale. A' plays and tumbles, driving all the small fry before him, and at the last devours them all at a mouthful, such whales have I heard on of the land, who never leave gaping till they've swallowed the whole parish, church, steeple, bells and hook. A pretty moral. But master, if I had been the sexton, I would have been that day in the belfry. Why, man? Because he should have swallowed me too. And when I had been in his belly, I would have kept such a jangling of the bells, that he should never have left, till he cast bells, steeple, church, and parish up again. But if the good King Simonides were of my mind, Simonides! We would purge the land of these drones, that rob the bee of her honey. How from the finny subject of the sea these fishers tell the infirmities of men. And from their watery empire recollect all that may men approve or men detect! Peace be at your labors honest fishermen. Honest, good fellow, what's that?[chuckles] Let it be a day fits you, scratch out of the calendar, and nobody looks after it. [fishermen laugh] May see the sea hath cast upon your coast. What a drunken knave was the sea to cast thee in our way! A man whom both the waters and the wind in that, vast tennis court, have made the ball for them to play upon. Entreats you, pity him. He asks of you that never used to beg. Nay, friend, cannot you beg? [chuckles] Here's them in our land of Greece gets more with begging than we can get with working. [fishermen chuckle] Canst thou catch fishes then? I never practiced it. Nay, then thou wilt starve sure. For there's nothing to be got nowadays unless thou canst fish for it. [fishermen chuckle] What I've been I've forgot to know. But what I am, want teaches me to think on. A man, thronged up with cold,[breathing heavily] my veins are chill, [breathing heavily] and have no more of life than may suffice to give my tongue that heat to ask your help. Which if you shall refuse, when I'm dead, for that I am a man, pray see me buried. Die quoth-a? Nay god forbid, I have a coat here, come put it on, keep thee warm. Ah, ah, afore[chuckles] me a handsome fellow! [chuckles] Come thou shalt go home, and we'll have flesh for holidays, and fish for fasting days, and moreover puddings and flap-jacks and thou shalt be welcome![chuckles] Thank you sir. Hark you my friend, you said you could not beg! [chuckles] I did but crave. But crave, oh then I'll turn craver too, so I shall escape whipping. [fishermen giggle] Why are all your beggars whipped, then? Oh not all friend, no, not all. For if all your beggars were whipped, I would wish for no better office than to be beadle.[laughs heartily] But master, I'll go draw up the nets. How well this honest mirth becomes their labor! Hark you friend, do you know where ye are? Not well. Why I'll tell you,[grunts] this is called Pentapolis, and our king the good Simonides. The good Simonides, do you call him? Ay and he deserves so to be called, for his peaceable reign and good government. He is a happy king, since he gains from his subjects the name of good by his government. [fisherman chuckles] How far is his court distant from this shore? Oh marry sir, half a day's journey [laughs heartily] And I'll tell you, he hath a fair daughter, and tomorrow is her birthday, and there be knights and princes come from all parts of the world to joust and tourney for her love. Were my fortunes equal to my desires, I could wish to make one there. Oh sir, that must be as it may. What a man may not get, he may lawfully deal for his wife's soul! -Help, master! -[rumbling] Help! Here's a fish hangs in the net like a poor man's right in the law. 'Twill hardly come out. [fishermen grunt ] Ha, bots on't, 'tis come at last! And 'tis turned into a rusty armor! An armor friends, I pray you, let me see it. Thanks fortune, yet that after all thy crosses thou gives me somewhat to repair myself. And though it was mine own, part of my heritage which my dead father did bequeath to me. With this strict charge even as he left his life, keep it my Pericles, it hath been a shield twixt me and death, and pointed to this brace, For that it saved me, keep it, in like necessity the which the gods protect thee from, may defend thee. It kept where I kept I so dearly loved it. Till the rough seas, that spare not any man, took it in rage, though calmed hath given it again. I thank thee for it! My shipwreck now's no ill since I've here my father's gave in his will. What mean you, sir? To beg of you kind friends, this coat of worth. -[gray-hair fisherman exclaims] -For it was sometimes target to a king, I know it by this mark. He loved me dearly, and for his sake I wish the having of it, and that you'd guide me to your sovereign's court. Where with it I may appear a gentleman. And if that ever my low fortune's better I'll pay your bounties. [fishermen giggle] Till then rest your debtor. Why, wilt thou tourney for the lady? [fishermen laugh heartily] I'll show the virtue that I've borne in arms. Why, do 'e take it, and the gods give thee good on it! Hark you, my friend! 'Twas we that made up this garment through the rough seams of the waters and there are certain condolements, certain vails. I hope sir if you do thrive, you'll remember from whence you had them. Believe it I will. By your furtherance I'm clothed in steel. And in spite of all the rapture of the sea, this jewel holds his building on mine arm. Unto thy value will I mount myself upon a courser whose delightful steps shall make the gazer joy to see him tread. [fishermen chuckle] Only my friends I'm yet unprovided of a pair of bases. We'll sure provide, thou shalt have my best gown to make thee a pair. And I'll bring thee to the court myself. Then, honor be but equal to my will, -this day I'll rise, -[fishermen chuckle] or else add ill to ill. [waves ebbing and flowing] [drums banging] [trumpet blowing] Are the knights ready to begin the triumph? Ay they are my liege. And stay your coming to present themselves. Return them, we are ready. And our daughter, in honor of whose birth these triumphs are, sits here like beauty's child, who nature gat for men to see, and seeing wonder at. It pleaseth you my royal father to express my commendations great, whose merit's less. It's fit it should be so. For princes are a model which heaven makes like to itself. As jewels lose their glory, if neglected, princes their renowns if not respected. [light melodic trumpet] 'Tis now your honor daughter to entertain the labor of each knight in his device. Which to preserve mine honor, I'll perform. [trumpet blowing] Who is the first that doth prefer himself? A knight of Sparta, my renowned father. And the device he bears upon his shield is a black Ethiope, reaching at the sun. The word, Lux tua vita mihi. He loves you well that holds his life of you. [trumpet blowing] Who is the second that presents himself? A prince of Macedon, my royal father. And the device he bears upon his shield is an armed knight that's conquered by a lady. The motto thus, in Spanish, Piu por dulzura que por fuerza. May, gentleness not force win me the day. [men chuckle and clap] [trumpet blowing] And what's the third? The third of Antioch. And his device, a wreath of chivalry. The word, Me pompae provexit apex. Desire to gain renown hath set me on. [men clap] [trumpet blows ] A burning torch that's turned upside down. The word, Quod me alit, me extinguit. Which shows that beauty hath his power at will, It can as well inflame as it can kill[chuckles and claps]. [men clap] -[trumpet bellows] -The fifth, an hand environed with clouds, holding out gold that's by the touchstone tried. The motto thus, Sic spectanda fides. Thus can you try a lasting faithfuls. [Simonides claps] And what's the sixth and last, the which the knight himself with such a graceful courtesy delivered? He seems to be a stranger. But his present is a withered branch. It's only green at top. The motto, In hac spe vivo. A pretty moral. In this hope I live. [chuckles] From the dejected state wherein he is, he hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish. He had need mean better than his outward show can any way speak in his just commend. For by his rusty outside he appears to have practiced more the whipstock than the lance. [Simonides chuckles] He well may be a stranger, for he comes to an honored triumph strangely furnished. And on set purpose let his armor rust until this day, to scour it in the dust. Opinion's but a fool, that makes us scan the outward habit for the inward man. But stay the knights are coming, we will withdraw into the gallery. -[trumpet bellows melodically] -[repetitive drum beat] [crowd shouting] [trumpet blowing] [horses stomping] [Crowd] The mean knight! The mean knight! [crowd cheers] Knights, to say you're welcome were superfluous. To place upon the volume of your deeds, as in a title-page, your worth in arms, were more than you expect, or more than's fit, since every worth in show commends itself[chuckles]. Prepare for mirth, for mirth becomes a feast. You are princes and my guests. [crowd claps] But you, my knight and guest. To whom this wreath of victory I give and crown you king of this day's happiness. 'Tis more by fortune lady than my merit. Call it by what you will, the day is yours [chuckles]. And here I hope is none that envies it. [crowd claps] In framing an artist art hath thus decreed to make some good but others to exceed. And you are her labored scholar. Come, queen of the feast, for daughter so you are. [crowd claps] Here take your place. Marshal the rest as they deserve their grace. We are honored much by good Simonides. Your presence glads our days. Honor we love for who hates honor hates the gods above. Sir, yonder is your place. Some other is more fit. Contend not sir, for we are gentlemen that neither in our hearts nor outward eyes envy the great, nor shall a low despise. You're right courteous knights. Sit, sir, sit. [crowd claps] [light guitar music] By Jove I wonder that is king of thoughts. These cates resist me he but thought upon them. By Juno that is queen of marriage, all viands that I eat do seem unsavory. Wishing him my meat. Sure he's a gallant gentleman. He's but a country gentleman. Has done no more than other knights have done. Has broken a staff or so, so let it pass. To me he seems like diamond to glass. Yon king's to me like to my father's picture. Which tells me in that glory once he was, had princes sit like stars about his throne, and he the sun for them to reverence. None that beheld him but like lesser lights did vail their crowns to his supremacy. Where now his son is like a glow worm in the night, the which hath fire in darkness, none in light. Whereby I see that time's the king of men. He's both their parent and he is their grave, and gives them what he will, not what they crave. What are you merry knights? Who can be other in this royal presence? Here with a cup that's stored unto the brim as you do love fill to your mistress' lips. [chairs shuffle] We drink this health to you. [Crowd] We thank your grace. [Loud thumping on table] -[light guitar music] -Yet pause awhile. Yon knight doth sit too melancholy, as if the entertainment in our court had not a show might countervail his worth. Note it not you, Thaisa? What is it to me, my father? Oh attend my daughter, princes in this should live like gods above, who freely give to every one who comes to honor them. Therefore to make his entertain more sweet, here say we drink this standing bowl of wine to him. [gauntlet bangs on table] Alas my father it befits not me unto a stranger knight to be so bold. He may my proffer take for an offense, since men take women's gifts for impudence. How? Do as I bid you, or you'll move me else. Now by the gods he could not please me better. Furthermore, tell him we desire to know of whence he is, his name and parentage. The King my father, sir, has drunk to you. I thank him. Wishing it so much blood unto your life. I thank both him and you, and pledge him freely. And further he desires to know of you of whence you are, your name and parentage. A gentleman of Tyre; my name Pericles; my education been in arts and arms; who, looking for adventures in the world was by the rough seas reft of ships and men. And after shipwreck driven upon this shore. He thanks your grace, names himself Pericles, a gentleman of Tyre, who only by misfortune of the seas bereft of ships and men cast on this shore. Now by the gods I pity his misfortune. And will awake him from his melancholy. Come gentlemen, we sit too long on trifles and waste the time which looks for other revels. [crowd laughs] Even in your armors as you are addressed, will very well become a soldier's dance. -[music plays] -I will not have excuse, with saying this loud music is too harsh for ladies' heads, since they love men in arms as well as beds. [drums beating melodically] [knights make war sounds] [swords clanking] [man screams] [crowd claps] [crowd claps] This was well asked, 'twas so well performed. Come sir, there's a lady that wants breathing too. I have heard you knights of Tyre are excellent in making ladies trip [chuckles]. And that their measures are as excellent. In those that practice them they are, my lord. Oh, that's as much as you would be denied of your fair courtesy [chuckles]. [crowd claps] [romantic music] [dancers clap] [dancers exclaim] [crowd claps] [slow romantic classical music] [Pericles clicks fingers] [upbeat classical music] [crowd cheers and claps melodically] [crowd cheers loudly and claps] Unclasp, unclasp. Thanks gentlemen to all, all have done well. But you the best. Pages and lights, to conduct these knights unto their several lodgings! Yours sir we have given order to be next our own. I am at your grace's pleasure. Princes, it is too late to talk of love and that's the mark I know you level at [chuckles]. Therefore each one betake him to his rest, tomorrow all for speeding do their best. [somber music] No Escanes, know this of me, Antiochus from incest lived not free. For which the most high gods, not minding longer to withhold the vengeance that they had in store, due to this heinous capital offense. Even in the height and pride of all his glory. When he was seated in a chariot of an inestimable value, and his daughter with him, a fire from heaven came and shriveled up their bodies even to loathing, for they so stunk, that all those eyes adored them ere their fall scorn now their hand should give them burial. 'Twas very strange. And yet but justice, for though this king was great, his greatness was no guard to bar heaven's shaft, but sin had his reward. 'Tis very true. See, not a man in private conference or council has respect with him but he. It shall no longer grieve without reproof. And cursed be he that will not second it. Follow me, then. Lord Helicane, a word. With me? And welcome, happy day my lords. Know that our griefs are risen to the top, and now at length they overflow their banks. Your griefs? For what? Wrong not the prince you love. Wrong not yourself then noble Helicane. But if the Prince do live, let us salute him, or know what ground's made happy by his breath. If in the world he live, we'll seek him out. If in his grave he rest, we'll find him there, and be resolved he lives to govern us, or dead, gives cause to mourn his funeral and leave us to our free election. Whose death's indeed the strongest in our censure. And knowing this kingdom if without a head, like goodly buildings left without a roof soon fall to ruin, your noble self, who best know how to rule and how to reign, we thus submit unto, our sovereign. [The Lords] Live, noble Helicane! Live, noble Helicane! By honor's cause, forbear your suffrages. If that you love Prince Pericles forbear. Take I your wish I leap into the seas, where's hourly trouble for a minute's ease. A twelvemonth longer let me entreat you further to bear the absence of your king. If in which time expired he not return, I shall with aged patience bear your yoke. But, if I cannot win you to this love, go search like nobles, like noble subjects, and in your search spend your adventurous worth. Whom if you find, and win unto return, you shall like diamonds sit about his crown. To wisdom he's a fool that will not yield. And since Lord Helicane enjoineth us, we with our travels will endeavor it. Then you love us, we you, and we'll clasp hands. When peers thus knit, a kingdom ever stands. [paper ruffles] Good morrow to the good Simonides. Knights, from my daughter this I let you know, that for this twelvemonth she'll not undertake a married life. Her reason to herself is only known which yet from her by no means can I get. May we not get access to her, my lord? Faith by no means, she has so strictly tied her to her chamber, that 'tis impossible. One twelve moons more she'll wear Diana's livery, this by the eye of Cynthia hath she vowed and on her virgin honor will not break it. Loath to bid farewell, we take our leaves. So, they are well dispatched, now to my daughter's letter. She tells me here she'll wed the stranger knight, or never more to view nor day nor light. 'Tis well mistress your choice agrees with mine, I like that well. Nay, how absolute she's in't. Not minding whether I dislike or no! Well I do commend her choice, and will no longer have it be delayed. Soft here he comes I must dissemble it. [footsteps thumping] All fortune to the good Simonides! To you as much. Sir I'm beholding to you for your sweet music this last night. I do protest my ears were never better fed with such delightful pleasing harmony. It is your grace's pleasure to commend not my dessert. Sir, you are music's master. The worst of all her scholars, my good lord. Let me ask you one thing, what do you think of my daughter, sir? A most virtuous princess. And she is fair too, is she not? As a fair day in summer, wondrous fair. Sir, my daughter thinks very well of you. Ay so well that you must be her master and she will be your scholar, therefore look to it. I am unworthy for her schoolmaster. -She thinks not so. -[paper ruffles] Peruse this writing else. What's here? A letter that she loves the knight of Tyre. [paper ruffles] 'Tis the king's subtlety, to have my life. Oh seek not to entrap me, gracious lord, a stranger and distressed gentleman that never aimed so high to love your daughter, but bent all offices to honor her. Thou hast bewitched my daughter, and thou art a villain. By the gods, I've not! Never did thought of mine levy offense, nor never did my actions yet commence a deed might gain her love or your displeasure. Traitor, thou liest! Traitor? Ay, traitor. Even in his throat unless it be the king that calls me traitor, I return the lie. [Simonides bangs on the table] Now by the gods I do applaud his courage. My actions are as noble as my thoughts, that never relished of a base descent. I came unto your court for honor's cause and not to be a rebel to her state. And he that otherwise accounts of me this sword shall prove he's honor's enemy. No! Here comes my daughter, she can witness it. Then as you are as virtuous as fair, resolve your angry father, if my tongue did ere solicit, or my hand subscribe to any syllable that, made love to you. Why sir, say if you had, who takes offense at that would make me glad? Yay mistress, are you so peremptory? I am glad on't with all my heart. I'll tame you, I'll bring you in subjection. Will you not having my consent bestow your love and your affections upon a stranger? Who for aught I know may be nor can I think the contrary as great in blood as I myself. Therefore hear you mistress, either frame your will to mine and you sir, hear you, either be ruled by me or I will make you, man and wife. Nay come your hands and lips must seal it too. And being joined, I'll thus your hopes destroy and for further grief, God give you joy! [Simonides and Thaisa laugh] What are you both pleased? Yes, if you love me sir. Even as my life, my blood that fosters it. What, are you both agreed? Yes. If it please your majesty.[giggles] Oh It pleaseth me so well, that I will see you wed. And then with what haste you can get you to bed. [all laugh] [romantic classical music] Now sleep ye slaked hath the rout, no din but snores the house about, made louder by the o'er fed breast of this most pompous marriage feast. The cat, with eyne of burning coal, now crouches fore the mouse's hole, and crickets at the oven's mouth, sing the blither for their drouth. Hymen hath brought the bride to bed. Where, by the loss of maidenhead, a babe is molded. Be attent, and time that is so briefly spent with your fine fancies quaintly eche. What's dumb in show I'll plain with speech. -[light classical music] -By many a dern and painful perch of Pericles the careful search, by the four opposing coigns which the world together joins is made, with all due diligence that horse and sail and high expense can stead the quest. At last from Tyre, fame answering the most strange inquire to the court of King Simonides are letters brought, the tenor these. Antiochus and his daughter dead, the men of Tyrus on the head of Helicanus would set on the crown of Tyre, but he will none. The mutiny he there hastes to appease, says to 'em, if King Pericles come not home in twice six moons, he obedient to their dooms will take the crown. The sum of this, sent hither to Pentapolis, ye ravished the regions round and every one with claps can sound, our heir-apparent is a king! Who dreamed, who thought of such a thing? Breathe, we must hence depart to Tyre. His queen with child makes her desire, which who shall cross, along to go. Omit we all their dole and woe. Lychorida her nurse, she takes, and so to sea. Their vessel shakes on Neptune's billow, -[waves crashing] -Half the flood hath their keel cut, but fortune's mood varies again, the grisled north disgorges such a tempest forth, that as a duck for life that dives so up and down the poor ship drives. The lady shrieks and well-a-near does fall in travail with her fear. And what ensues in this fell storm, shall for itself, itself perform. I nil relate, action may conveniently the rest convey, which might not what by me is told. In your imagination hold this now the ship, -[thunder rumbles] -upon whose deck the sea-tost Pericles appears to speak. Thou god of this great vast, rebuke these surges which wash both heaven and hell! And thou, that hast upon the winds command, bind them in brass having called them -from the deep! -[thunder claps] Oh, still thy deafening, dreadful thunders, -[thunder claps] -gently quench thy nimble, sulfurous flashes! Oh, how Lychorida, how does my queen? Thou stormest venomously, wilt thou spit all thyself? The seaman's whistle is as a whisper in the ears of death, unheard. Lychorida! Lucina, oh divinest patroness and midwife gentle to those that cry by night, convey thy deity aboard our dancing boat. Make swift the pangs of our queen's travails! Now, Lychorida! Here's a thing too young for such a place. Who if it had conceit would die as I am like to do. Take in your arms this piece of your dead queen. How? How, Lychorida!? Patience, good sir do not assist the storm. Here's all that is left living of your queen, a little daughter, for the sake of it, be manly, and take comfort. Oh you gods![weeping] Why do you make us love your goodly gifts and snatch them straight away? We here below recall not what we give, and therein may use honor with you. Patience, good sir,[crying] even for this charge. [storm raging] Now mild may be thy life! For a more blusterous birth had never babe. Quiet and gentle thy conditions! For thou art the rudeliest welcome to this world that ever was prince's child. Happy what follows! Thou hast this chiding in nativity, as fire, air, water, earth and heaven can make to herald thee from the womb. Poor inch of nature, even at the first thy loss is more than can thy portage quit, with all thou canst find here. -[thunder rumbles] -Thou now good gods, throw their best eyes upon it! [footsteps thumping] What courage sir God save you! Courage enough, I do not fear the flaw that's done to me the worst. Yet, for the love of this poor infant, this fresh new seafarer, I would it would be quiet! [thunder rumbles] Slack the bolins there! Thou wilt not wilt thou blow and split thyself! Sea room, and the brine and cloudy billow kiss the moon, I care not! Sir, your queen must overboard. The sea works high and the wind is loud, and will not lie till the ship be cleared of the dead. That's your superstition! Pardon me sir, with us at sea it hath been still observed and we are strong in custom. Therefore briefly yield her for she must overboard straight! As you think meet. Most wretched queen! [thunder rumbles] -[raindrops fall on ship] -Here she lies [thunder rumbles] A terrible childbed hast thou had my dear. No light, no fire, the unfriendly elements forgot thee, utterly. Nor have I time to give thee hallowed to thy grave, but straight must cast thee scarcely coffined in the ooze. Where for a monument upon thy bones, and e'er remaining lamps, the belching whale and the water must o'erwhelm thy corpse, lying with simple shells. [inhales] Oh Lychorida, bid Nestor bring me spices, ink and paper, my casket and my jewels. And bid Nicander bring me the satin coffer. Lay the babe upon the pillow. Hie thee while I say a priestly farewell to her. Suddenly, woman! -[thunder rumbles] -Sir, we have a chest beneath the hatches, caulked and bitumed ready. I thank thee. Mariner, say what coast is this? We are near Tarsus. Thither, gentle mariner, alter thy course for Tyre. When canst thou reach it? By break of day, if the wind cease. Oh, make for Tarsus! There will I visit Cleon, for the babe cannot hold out to Tyrus. There I'll leave it at careful nursing. Go thy ways, good mariner. I'll bring the body presently. [storm rages] [ship creaks] [waves crashing gently] [man coughs] -Philemon, ho! -[man coughs] Doth my lord call? Get fire and meat for these poor men. It has been a turbulent and stormy night. [man coughs] I have been in many, but such a night as this till now, I ne'er endured. Your master will be dead ere you return. There's nothing can be ministered to nature that can recover him. [man coughs] [man coughs deeply] [man coughs deeply] Give this to the pothecary, there, and tell me how it works. Good morrow. Good morrow to your lordship. Gentlemen, why do you stir so early? Oh Sir, our lodgings standing bleak upon the sea, shook as the earth did quake. The very principals did seem to rend, and all to topple, pure surprise and fear made me to quit the house. That is the cause we trouble you so early, 'tis not our husbandry. Oh, you say well [chuckles]. Well I much marvel that your lordship, having rich tire about you should at these early hours shake off the golden slumber of repose. 'Tis most strange, nature should be so conversant with pain, being thereto not compelled. I hold it ever, virtue and cunning were endowments greater than nobleness and riches. Careless heirs may the two latter darken and expend, but immortality attends the former. Making a man, a god [chuckles]. 'Tis known, I ever have studied physic, through which secret art, by turning o'er authorities, I have, together with my practice, made familiar to me and to my aid, the best infusions that dwell in vegetives, in metals, stones. And can speak of the disturbances that nature works, and of her cures. Which doth give me a more content in course of true delight than to be thirsty after tottering honor, or tie my treasure up in silken bags to please the fool and death. Your honor has through Ephesus poured forth your charity, and hundreds call themselves your creatures, who by you have been restored. And not your knowledge, your personal pain, but even your purse, still open, hath built Lord Cerimon such strong renown as time shall never erase. So lift there. What's that? Sir, even now did the sea toss upon our shore this chest. 'Tis of some wreck. Well set it down, let's look upon it. 'Tis like a coffin, sir. Whate'er it be, 'tis wondrous heavy. Wrench it open straight! If the sea's stomach be o'ercharged with gold, 'tis a good constraint of fortune it belches upon us. [chuckles] 'Tis so, my lord. How close 'tis caulked and bitumed! Did the sea cast it up? I never saw so huge a billow sir as tossed it upon shore. Wrench it open. [tools clatter] [man hammers coffin] Soft, it smells most sweetly in my sense. A delicate odor. As ever hit my nostril so open it. [tools clatter] Oh you most potent gods, what's here? A corse. Most strange! Shrouded in cloth of state, balmed and entreasured with full bags of spices! Passport too! Apollo, perfect me in the characters. Here I give to understand, if e'er this coffin drive a-land, I, King Pericles, have lost this queen, worth all our mundane cost. Who finds her, give her burying; She was the daughter of a king. Besides this treasure for a fee, the gods requite his charity. Oh Pericles if thou livest, thou hast a heart that even cracks for woe! This chanced tonight. Most likely, sir. Nay, certainly tonight! For look how fresh she looks! They were too rough, that threw her in the sea. Make a fire within, fetch hither all my boxes in my closet. Death may usurp on nature many hours, and yet the fire of life kindle again the o'erpress'd spirits. I read of some Egyptians who after four hours death have raised impoverished spirits like this, unto their former health. Well said, well said, the fire and cloths. The still and woeful music that we have, cause it to sound beseech you. [somber classical music] The viol once more. [exclaims] Thou stirre't, thou block! The music there, I pray you, give her air. Gentlemen, this queen will live, -nature awakes, -[soft classical music] a warmth breathes out of her. She hath not been entranced above five hours. See how she gins to blow into life's flower again! The heavens through you increase our wonder and set up your fame forever! She is alive, behold her eyelids, cases to those heavenly jewels which Pericles hath lost, begin to part their fringes of bright gold. -[uplifting classical music] -The diamonds of a most praised water doth appear, to make the world twice rich. Live, and make us weep to hear your fate, fair creature rare as you seem to be. [uplifting music] Oh dear Diana where am I? Where's my lord? What world is this? Is not this strange? Most rare. Hush, my gentle neighbors! Lend me your hands, to the next chamber bear her. Get linen. Now this matter must be looked to for her relapse is mortal. Come, come. And Esculapius, guide us! [upbeat music] [man shouts] Most honored Cleon must needs be gone. My twelve months are expired and Tyrus stands in a litigious peace. You and your lady take from my heart all thankfulness! The gods make up the rest upon you! Your strikes a fortune, though they hurt you mortally, yet glance full woundingly on us. Oh your sweet queen! That the strict fates had pleased you had brought her hither to have blessed mine eyes with her! We cannot but obey the powers above us. Could I rage and roar as doth the sea she lies in, yet the end must be as 'tis. My gentle babe Marina, whom for she was born at sea, I've named so. Here I charge your charity withal, leaving her the infant of your care, beseeching you to give her princely training that she may be mannered as she is born. Fear not my lord but think, your grace that fed my country with your corn, for which the people's prayers still fall upon you, must in your child be thought on. If neglection therein should make me vile, the common body by you relieved would force me to my duty. But if to that my nature need a spur, the gods revenge it on me and mine, to the end of generation! I believe you, your honor and your goodness teach me to it without your vows. Till she be married madam, by bright Diana, whom we honor, all unscissored shall this hair of mine remain, though I show ill in it. So I take my leave. Good madam make me blessed in your care in bringing up my child. I have one myself, -who shall not be -[Marina cries] more dear to my respect than yours, my lord. Madam my thanks and prayers. We'll bring your grace even to the edge of the shore, then give you up to the masked Neptune, and the gentlest winds of heaven. I will embrace your offer. Come dearest madam. Oh no tears, Lychorida, no tears. Look to your little mistress, on whose grace you may depend hereafter. -[Marina cries louder] -Come, my lord. [sad classical music] [Marina cries] [waves crashing] Madam, this letter, and some certain jewels lay with you in your coffer which are at your command. Know you the character? It is my lord's. That I was shipped at sea, I well remember, even on my eaning time, but whether there delivered, by the holy gods I cannot rightly say. [waves crashing gently] But since King Pericles, my wedded lord I ne'er shall see again. A vestal livery will I take me to, and never more have joy. Madam, if this you purpose as ye speak, Diana's temple is not distant far, where you may abide till your date expire. Moreover, if you please, a niece of mine shall there attend you. My recompense is thanks, that's all. Yet my good will is great, though the gift small. [somber classical music] Imagine Pericles arrived at Tyre, welcomed and settled to his own desire. His woeful queen we leave at Ephesus, unto Diana there's a votarist. Now to Marina bend your mind, whom our fast-growing scene must find at Tarsus. And by Cleon trained in music's letters, who hath gained of education all the grace, that make her both the heart and place of general wonder. But alack, that monster envy, oft the wrack of earned praise, Marina's life seeks to take off by treason's knife. And in this kind our Cleon hath one daughter, and a wench full grown, even ripe for marriage rite, this maid Hight Philoten. And it is said for certain in our story, she would ever with Marina be. Be it when she weaved the sleided silk, with fingers, long, small, white as milk; or when she would with sharp needle wound the cambric, which she made more sound by hurting it; or when to the lute she sung and made the night bird mute, that still records with moan; or when she would with rich and constant pen, vail to her mistress Dian. Still, this Philoten contends in skill with absolute Marina. So, with dove of Paphos might the crow vie feathers white. Marina gets all praises, which are paid as debts, and not as given. This so darks in Philoten, all graceful marks, that Cleon's wife with envy rare, a present murderer does prepare for good Marina, that her daughter might stand peerless by this slaughter. The sooner her vile thoughts to stead, Lychorida, our nurse, is dead. And cursed Dionyza hath the pregnant instrument of wrath prest for this blow. The unborn event I do commend to your content. Only I carry winged time, post on the lame feet of my rhyme, which never could I so convey, unless your thoughts went on my way. Dionyza doth appear, with Leonine, a murderer. Thy oath remember. Thou hast sworn to do it, 'tis but a blow, which never shall be known. Thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon, to yield thee so much profit. Let not conscience, which is but cold, nor flaming love thy bosom in slave too nicely, nor let pity, which even women have cast off melt thee, but be a soldier to thy purpose. I will do it; but yet, she is a goodly creature. The fitter then the gods should have her. Here she comes weeping, for her nurse's death. Thou art resolved? I am resolved. No, [sighs] I will rob Tellus of her weed, to strew thy green with flowers. The yellows and blues, purple violets, and marigolds shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave. While summer days doth last. Ay me poor maid, born in a tempest when my mother died, this world to me is like a lasting storm, whirring me from my friends. How now, Marina! Why do you keep alone? How chance my daughter is not with you? Do not consume your blood with sorrowing, what, have you a nurse of me. Lord, how your favor's changed with this unprofitable woe. Come, give me your flowers, on the sea margin walk with Leonine; the air is quick there and it pierces and sharpens the stomach. Come, Leonine take her by the arm, walk with her. No, I pray you, I'll not bereave you of your servant. Come, come, I love the king your father, and yourself with more than foreign heart. We every day expect him here. When he shall come and see our paragon to all reports thus blasted, he will repent the breadth of his great voyage, blame both my lord and me, that we have taken no care to your best courses. Go, I pray you, walk, and be cheerful once again. Reserve that excellent complexion which did steal the eyes of young and old. Care not for me I can go home alone. Well, I will go, but yet I have no desire to it. Come, come, I know 'tis good for you. Walk half an hour Leonine, at the least. Remember what I have said. I warrant you, madam. I'll leave you my sweet lady, for a while. Pray walk softly, do not heat your blood. What, I must have a care of you. My thanks, sweet madam. Is this wind westerly that blows? South west. When I was born, the wind was north. Was it so? My father, as nurse said, did never fear, but cried good seaman to the sailors, galling his kingly hands, haling ropes, and clasping to the mast endured a sea that almost burst the deck. When was this? When I was born. Never was wind nor waves more violent, and from the ladder tackle washes off a canvas climber. Ha says one, 'wilt out? And with a dripping industry they skip from stern to stern the boatswain whistles and the master calls and trebles their confusion. Come, say your prayers. What mean you? If you require a little space for prayer, I grant it. Pray, but be not tedious for the gods are quick of ear and I am sworn to do my work with haste. Why will you kill me? To satisfy my lady. Why would she have me killed? Now as I can remember by my troth, I never did her hurt in all my life. I never spake bad word, nor did ill turn to any living creature, believe me la, I never killed a mouse, nor hurt a fly, nor trod upon a worm against my will, but I wept for it. How have I offended, wherein my death might yield her any profit, or my life imply her any danger? My commission is not to reason of the deed, but do it. You will not do it for all the world, I hope. You are well favored, and your looks foreshow you have a gentle heart. I saw you lately, when you caught hurt in parting two that fought, good sooth it showed well in you. Do so now. Your lady seeks my life, come you between, save poor me, the weaker. I am sworn, and will dispatch. Hold, villain! [Leonine grunts] A prize! A prize! Half part, half part mates. Come, let's have her aboard suddenly. These roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes and they have seized Marina. Let her go. There's no hope she will return. I'll swear she's dead, and thrown into the sea. But I'll see further. Perhaps they will but please themselves upon her, not carry her aboard. If she remain, whom they have ravished must, by me be slain. [upbeat classical music] Boult! [door bangs] Sir? Search the market narrowly, Mytilene is full of gallants, we lost too much money this mart by being too wenchless. We were never so much out of creatures. We have but poor three, and they can do no more than they can do, and they with continual action are even as good as rotten. Therefore let's have fresh ones, whate'er we pay for them. If there be not a conscience to be used in every trade, we shall never prosper. Thou sayest true, 'tis not our bringing up of poor bastards, as I think I have brought up some eleven. Ay, to eleven and brought them down again. But till I go search the market? What else, man? The stuff we have, a strong wind will blow it to pieces, they are so pitifully sodden! Thou sayest true, there's too unwholesome, o' conscience. The poor Transylvanian is dead, that lay with the little baggage. Ay, she quickly pooped him, she made him roast meat for worms. I'll go search the market. Three or four thousand chequins were as pretty a proportion to live quietly, and so give over. Why to give over, I pray you? Is it a shame to get when we are old? Oh, our credit comes not in like the commodity, nor the commodity wages not with the danger, therefore if in our youths we could pick up some pretty estate, 'twere not amiss to keep our door hatched. Besides, the sore terms we stand upon with the gods will be strong with us for giving over. Come, other sorts offend as well as we. As well as we ay, and better too; we offend worse. Neither is our profession any trade. It's no calling! [Boult] Come your ways, my masters. Here comes Boult. You say she is a virgin? Oh sir, we doubt it not. Master, I have gone through for this piece, you see. If you like her so, if not, I've lost my earnest. Boult, has she any qualities? She has a good face, speaks well, and has excellent good clothes. There's no further necessity of qualities can make her be refused. What's her price, Boult? They cannot be bated one doit of a thousand pieces. Well, follow me my masters, you shall have your money presently. Wife, take her in. Instruct her what she has to do that she may not be raw in her entertainment. [door bangs shut] Boult! Take there the marks of her, the color of her hair, complexion, height, her age, with warrant of her virginity, and cry he that gives most shall have her first. Such a maidenhead were no cheap thing, if men were as they have been [chuckles]. Get this done as I command you. Performance shall follow. Alack Leonine was so slack, so slow, he should have struck not spoke, [sighs] or that these pirates, not enough barbarous, had not o'erboard thrown me, to see my mother! Why lament you, pretty one? That I am pretty. Come, the gods have done their part in you. I accuse them not. You're light into my hands, where you are like to live. The more my fault to scape his hands where I was like to die. You shall live in pleasure. -No. -Oh yes indeed shall you, and taste gentlemen of all fashion. You shall fare well. You shall have the difference of all complexions. What! Do you stop your ears? Are you a woman? What would you have me be, an I be not a woman? An honest woman, or not a woman. [laughs heartily] Marry, whip thee, gosling. I think I shall have something to do with you. Come, you're a young foolish sapling, and must be bowed as I would have you. Oh the gods defend me! If it please the gods to defend you by men, then men must comfort you, men must feed you, men to stir you up [chuckles]. Boult's returned. Now now sir, hast thou cried her through the market? I have cried her almost to the number of her hairs, I have drawn her picture with my voice. And I pray you had how dost thou find the inclination of the people, especially of the younger sort? Faith, they listened to me as they would have hearkened to their father's testament. The Spaniard's mouth watered, that he went to bed to her very description [chuckles]. We shall have him here tomorrow with his best ruff on. Tonight, tonight. But mistress, do you know the french knight that cowers in the hams? Who, Monsieur Veroles? Ah, he, he offered to cut a caper at the proclamation, but he made a groan at it, and swore he would see her tomorrow. [Bawd and Boult laugh heartily] Well, well, as for him he brought his disease hither, here he does but repair it. I know he will come in our shadow, to scatter his crowns in the sun. Well, if we had of every nation a traveler, we should lodge them all with this sign. Pray you, come hither awhile. You have fortunes coming upon you. Mark me! You must seem to do that fearfully which you commit willingly, despise profit where there is have most gain. And to weep, that you live as ye do, makes pity in your lovers. Seldom but that pity begets you a good opinion, and that opinion a clear profit. I understand you not. Oh, take her home mistress, take her home. These blushes of hers must be quenched with some present practice. Thou sayest true in faith, for your bride goes to that with shame which is her way to go with warrant. Faith some do, and some do not. But mistress, if I have bargained for the joint-- Thou mayst cut a morsel off the spit. I may so. -Who should deny it? -[Boult giggles] Come, young one. I like the manner of your garments well. Ay, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet. Boult, spend thou that in the town. Report what a sojourner we have, you'll lose nothing by custom. When nature flamed this piece she meant thee a good turn, therefore say what a paragon she is, and that thou hast the harvest out of thine own report. I warrant thee mistress, thunder shall not so awake the beds of eels, as my giving out her beauty, stir up the lewdly inclined. I'll bring home some tonight. [Bawd chuckles] Come your way, follow me. If fires be hot, knives sharp, or waters deep, untied I still my virgin knot will keep. Diana, aid my purpose! What have we to do with Diana? Pray you, will you go with us? [somber classical music] Why, are you foolish? Can it be undone? Dionyza! Such a piece of slaughter the sun and moon ne'er looked upon! I think you'll turn child again. Were I chief lord of all this spacious world, I'd give it to undo the deed. Oh lady, much less in blood than virtue, yet a princess to equal any single crown of the earth if the justice of compare! O villain Leonine! Whom thou hast poisoned too. If thou hadst drunk to him it'd been a kindness becoming well thy lacked. What canst thou say when noble Pericles shall demand his child? That she is dead. Nurses are not the fates, to foster is not ever to preserve. She died at night, I'll say so. Who can cross it? Unless you play the pious innocent and for an honest attribute cry out she died by foul play. Oh, go to. Well, well. Of all the faults beneath the heavens the gods do like this worst. Be one that thinks the petty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence and open this to Pericles. I shame to think of what a noble strain you are and of how coward a spirit. To such proceeding who ever but his approbation gave and not his prime consent, he did not flow from honorable sources. Be it so then. Yet none but you does know how she came dead, nor none can know, Leonine being gone. She did disdain my child, stood between her and her fortunes, none would look on her but cast their gazes on Marina's face whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin not worth the time of day. It pierced me through, and though you call my course unnatural, you not your child well loving, yet I find it greets me as an enterprise of kindness performed to your sole daughter. Heavens forgive it! And as for Pericles, what should he say? We wept after her hearse, and yet we mourn. Her monument is almost finished. And her epitaphs in glittering golden characters express a general praise to her, and care in us at whose expense 'tis done. Thou art like the harpy, which to betray does with thine angel's face, seize with thine eagle's talons. You are like one that superstitiously do swear to the gods that winter kills the flies. But yet I know you'll do as I advise. Thus time we waste, and long leagues make short; Sail seas in cockles, have an wish but for it, making to take your imagination from bourn to bourn, region to region where our scenes seem to live. I do beseech you to learn of me, who stand in the gaps to teach you the stages of our story. Pericles is now again thwarting the wayward seas, attended on by many a lord and knight to see his daughter, all his life's delight. Old Helicanus goes along, behind he's left to govern if you bear in mind, old Escanus, whom Helicanus late advanced in Tyre to great and higher state. Well sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought this king to Tarsus. Think his pilot thought, so with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on, to fetch his daughter home, who first is gone. Like motes and shadows see them move awhile, your ears unto your eyes I'll reconcile. [brassy classical music] [loud brassy music] See how belief may suffer by foul show! This borrowed passion stands for true old woe. And Pericles, in sorrow all devoured, with sighs shot through and biggest tears o'ershower'd, leaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swears never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs. He puts on sackcloth and to sea. He bears a tempest, that his mortal vessel tears and yet, he rides it out. Now please you wit. The epitaph is for Marina writ, by wicked Dionyza. The fairest, sweet'st and best lies here, who withered in her spring of year. [Dionyza and Gower] She was of Tyrus the king's daughter, on whom foul death hath made this slaughter. -Marina was she called, -[light somber music] [Dionyza] And at her birth, the sea being proud, swallowed some part of the earth. Therefore the earth fearing to be o'erflow'd, hath the seas birth child on the heavens bestowed. Wherefore she does and swears she'll never stint, make raging battery upon shores of flint. No visor does become black villainy so well as soft and tender flattery. Let Pericles believe his daughter's dead, and bear his courses to be ordered by Lady Fortune. While our scene must play his daughter's woe and heavy well a day in her unholy service. Patience then, and think you all are now in Mytilene. [classical music] [door bangs] Did you ever hear the like? No, nor never shall do in such a place as this, she being once gone. But to have divinity preached there! Did you ever dream of such a thing? No, no. Come, I am for no more bawdy houses. Shall us go hear the vestals sing? [chuckles] I'll do any thing now that is virtuous, but I am out of the road of rutting for ever. [lively classical music] Well, I had rather than twice the worth of her she had ne'er come here. Fie, fie upon her! She's able to freeze the god Priapus, and undo a whole generation. We must either get her ravished, or be rid of her. When she should do for clients her fitment, and do me the kindness of our profession, she has me her quirks, her reasons, her master reasons, her prayers, her knees. She would make a puritan of the devil, if he would cheapen a kiss of her. Faith, I must ravish her, or she'll disfurnish us of all our cavalier, and make our swearers priests. Now, the pox upon her green sickness for me. Faith there's no way to be rid on it but by way to the pox. Here comes the Lord Lysimachus, disguised. [beads jingle] How now! -[Bawd exclaims] -[all laugh] How a dozen of virginities? Now the gods to bless your honor! I am glad to see your honor is in good health. You may so, 'tis well for you that your resorters stand upon sound legs. [all chuckle] How now, wholesome iniquity. Have you that a man may deal withal, and defy the surgeon? Well, we have here one sir, if she would but [laughs], but there never came her like in Mytilene. If she would but do the deed of darkness thou wouldst say. Your honor knows what 'tis to say well enough. Well, call forth, call forth. For flesh and blood sir, white and red, you shall see a rose, and she were a rose indeed, if she had but-- What, prithee? -Oh, sir, I can be modest. -[Pandar chuckles] That dignifies the renown of a bawd, no less than it gives a good report for a number to be chaste. [all laugh] Here comes that, which grows to the stalk, never plucked yet, I can assure you. [footsteps thump] [beads jingle] Is she not a fair creature? Faith, she would serve after a long voyage at sea. [Bawd exclaims] [all laugh heartily] Here's for you, leave us. I beseech your honor, give me leave a word, and I'll have done presently. I beseech you, do. First, I would have you note, this is an honorable man. I desire to find him so, that I may worthily note him. Next, he's the governor of this country and a man whom I am bound to. If he govern the country, you are bound to him indeed. How honorable he is in that, I know not. Pray you, without any more virginal fencing, will you use him kindly? He will line your apron with gold. What he will do graciously, I will thankfully receive. [Lysimachus and Boult laugh] Have you done? My lord, she's not paced yet. You must take some pains to work her to your manage. Come, we will leave his honor and her together. Go thy ways. [beads jingle] [mellow classical music] Now pretty one, how long have you been of this trade? What trade, sir? Why, I cannot name it but I'll offend. I cannot be offended with my trade. Please you to name it. How long have you been of this profession? E'er since I can remember. Did you go to it so young? Were you a gamester at five or at seven? Earlier too, sir, if now I be one. Why the house you dwell in proclaims you to be a creature of sale. Do you know this house to be a place of such resort and will come into it? I hear say you are of honorable parts, and are the governor of this place. Why hath your principal made known unto you who I am? Who is my principal? Why your herb woman, she that sets seeds and roots of shame and iniquity. Oh, you have heard something of my power, and so stand aloof for more serious wooing. But I protest unto thee pretty one. My authority shall not see thee, or else look friendly upon thee. Come, bring me to some private place, come, come. If you were born to honor, show it now. If put upon you, make the judgment good that thought you worthy of it. Is this how's this how's this some more be sage. Reason is there in your justice for just power over all to undo any. Take you mine honor, and you make a gap into forbidden ground, where after, all may tread. If then with violence you mare this workmanship of heaven you will abuse your justice, kill your honor, and leave me, impoverished to the world. Why this same house we're in thou livest is a receptacle of all men's sins. A nurse of wickedness. How canst thou be anything but nought, that dwells within? Know you the roof but still willing to hear? Oh my good lord, if there be fire before me must I straight way run to burn myself? Or if suppose this house, which two too many feels such houses are, should be the doctor's patrimony and the surgeon's feeding, follows it that I must needs infect myself to maintain them? Oh, my yet good lord. Make me your servant and I will obey you. Let me live honest, and I am content. For this, or now, now, even in this minute, let me die [crying]. Oh, that the gods would set me free from this unhallowed place, though they did change me to the meanest bird that flies in the purer air! Partially this is virtue's image, rather virtue's self, come down from heaven awhile, to reign on earth, to teach us what we should be. I did not think thou couldst have spoke so well, ne'er dreamed thou couldst. I hither came with thoughts intemperate, foul and deformed. The which your tears have washed, till they are white. Your speech has mended my corrupted mind. Hold, here's gold for thee. Persever in the clear way thou goest, and the gods strengthen thee! The good gods preserve you! Lady to me the very doors and windows savor vilely. Fare thee well. Thou art a piece of virtue, and I doubt not but thy training hath been noble. Hold, here's more gold for thee. [gold jingles] A curse upon him die he like a thief, that robs thee of thy goodness! If thou dost hear from me, it shall be for thy good. I beseech your honor, one piece for me. Avaunt, thou damned door keeper! Your house, but for this virgin that doth prop it, would sink and overwhelm you. Away! [beads jingle] How's this? We must take another course with you. If your peevish chastity, which is not worth a breakfast in the cheapest country under the cope, shall undo a whole household, let me be gelded like a spaniel. Come your ways. -Would you have me? -[beads jingle] How now! What's the matter? Worse and worse, mistress. She has here spoke holy words to the Lord Lysimachus. Oh abominable! She makes our profession as it were to stink afore the face of the gods. Marry, hang her up for ever! The nobleman would have dealt with her like a nobleman, she sends him away as cold as a snowball, saying his prayers too. Boult, take her away. Use her at thy pleasure. Crack the glass of her virginity, and make the rest malleable! An if she were a thornier ground than she is, she shall be ploughed. Hark, hark, you gods! She conjures, away with her! Would she had never come within my doors! Marry, hang you! She's born to undo us. Will you not go the way of women kind? Marry, come up my dish of chastity, with rosemary and bays! [beads jingle] Come, mistress. I must have your maidenhead taken off, or the common hangman shall execute it. Come your ways. We'll have no more gentlemen driven away. Come your ways, I say. [Marina exclaims] [door bangs] Whither wilt thou have me? To take from you the jewel you hold so dear. Prithee, tell me one thing first. Come now, your one thing. Who does thou think thine enemy to be? Why, I could wish him to be my master, or rather, my mistress. Neither of these are so bad as thou art since they do better thee in their command. Thou hold'st a place for which the pained'st fiend of hell would not in reputation change. Thou art the damned doorkeeper to every Coistrel that comes inquiring for his Tib. To the choleric fisting of every rogue thy ear is liable. Thy food is such as hath been belched on by infected lungs. What would you have me do? Go to the wars, would you? Where a man may serve seven years for the loss of a leg, and then have not money enough to buy him a wooden one? Do any thing but this thou doest. Empty old receptacles or common shores of filth serve by indenture to the common hangman, any of these ways are yet better than this. For what thou professest, a baboon could he speak, would own a name too dear. [keys clank] Oh that the gods would safely deliver me from this place! [footsteps thumping] [Marina screams] Here, here's gold for thee. If that thy master would gain by thee proclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance. With other virtues which I'll keep from boast and I will undertake all these to teach. I doubt not but this populous city will yield many scholars. But can you teach all this you speak of? Prove that I cannot, take me home again, and prostitute me to the basest groom that doth frequent your house. [gold clanking] Well, I will see what I can do for thee. If I can place thee, I will. But amongst honest women. Faith, my acquaintance lies little amongst them. But, since my master and mistress have bought you, there's no going but by their consent. Therefore I will make them acquainted with your purpose, and I doubt not, but I shall find them tractable enough. Come, I'll do for thee what I can. Come your ways. [light flute music] [rooster crows] [dog barks] Marina thus the brothel 'scapes, and enters into an honest house, our story says. She sings like one immortal, and she dances as goddess like to her admired lays. Deep clerks she dumbs, and with her needle composes nature's own shape, of bud, bird, branch, and berry. That even her art, sisters the natural roses, her inkle, silk, twin with the rubied cherry, that pupils lacks she none of noble race, who pour their bounty on her, and her gain she gives the cursed Bawd. Here we her place. And to her father turn our minds again, where we left him, on the sea. We there him lost, whence, driven before the winds, he is arrived, here where his daughter dwells. And on this coast suppose him now at anchor. The city strives God Neptune's annual feast to keep, from whence Lysimachus our Tyrian ship espies. His banners sable, trimmed with rich expense. And to him in his barge with fervor hies. [seagulls crying] Where is lord Helicanus? He can resolve you. Oh here he is. Sir, there's a barge put off from Mytilene, and in it is Lysimachus the governor, who craves to come aboard. What is your will? That he have his. Call up some gentlemen. Ho gentleman, my lord calls! [footsteps thumping] Gentlemen, there's some of worth would come aboard, I pray, greet them fairly. Sir, this is the man that can in aught you would resolve you. Hail, reverend sir! The gods preserve you! And you, to outlive the age I am, and die as I would do. You wish me well. Being on shore, honoring of Neptune's triumphs, seeing this goodly vessel ride before us, I made to it, to know of whence you are. First, what is your place? I am the governor of this place you lie before. Sir, our vessel is of Tyre, in it the king, a man who for this three months hath not spoken to any one, nor taken sustenance but to prorogue his grief. Upon what ground is his distemperature? 'Twould be too tedious to repeat; But the main grief springs from the loss of a beloved daughter and a wife. May we not see him? You may but bootless is your sight, he will not speak to any. Yet let me obtain my wish. Behold him. This was a goodly person, till the disaster that one mortal night drove him to this. Sir king, all hail! Hail, royal sir! The gods preserve you. It is in vain, he will not speak to you. Sir, we have a maid in Mytilene I durst wager, would win some words of him. 'Tis well bethought. She questionless with her sweet harmony and other chosen attractions would allure, and make a battery through his deafened ports which now are midway stopped. She is all happy as the fairest of all, and with her fellow maids is now upon the leafy shelter that abuts against the island's side. Sure, all's effectless yet nothing we'll omit that bears recovery's name. But, since your kindness we have stretched thus far, let us beseech you that for our gold we may provision have, wherein we are not destitute for want, but weary for the staleness. [all chuckle] Oh, sir, a courtesy which if we should deny, the most just gods for every graff would send a caterpillar, and so inflict our province. [all chuckle] Yet, once more let me entreat to know at large the cause of your king's sorrow. Sit, sir, I will recount it to you. [seagull crying] But, see, I am prevented. Ah, here is the lady that I sent for. Welcome, fair one! Is't not a goodly presence? She's a gallant lady. She's such a one that were I well assured came of a gentle kind and noble stock. I'd wish no better choice, and think me rarely wed. Fair one, all goodness that consists in bounty expect even here, where is a kingly patient. If that thy prosperous and artificial feat can draw him but to answer thee in aught, thy sacred physic shall receive such pay as thy desires can wish. Sir, I will use my utmost skill in his recovery, provided that none but I and my companion maid be suffered to come near him. Come, let us leave her and the gods make her prosperous! [soft harmonious music] [Marina sings] [ship creaks] Marked he your music? No, nor looked on us. See, she will speak to him. Hail, sir! My lord, -lend ear. -Hum, ha! [Marina stumbles] I am a maid my lord that ne'er before invited eyes, but have been gazed on like a comet. She speaks my lord that may be hath endured a grief might equal yours if both were justly weighed. Though wayward fortune did malign my state, my derivation was from ancestors who stood equivalent with mighty kings. But time hath rooted out my parentage, and to the world and awkward casualties bound me in servitude. I will desist. There is something glows upon my cheek, and whispers in mine ear, go not till he speak. My fortunes, parentage, good parentage to equal mine! Was it not thus? What say you? I said my lord, if you did know my parentage, you would not do me violence. I do think so. Pray turn your eyes upon me. You are like something that... what country woman? Here of these shores? No, nor of any shores. Yet I was mortally brought forth, and am no other than I appear. I am great with woe, and shall deliver weeping. My dearest wife was like this maid, and such a one my daughter might have been. My queen's square brows, her stature to an inch, as wand like straight, as silver-voiced, her eyes as jewel-like and cased as richly, in pace another Juno, Who starves the ears she feeds and makes them hungry the more she gives them speech. Where do you live? Where I am but a stranger, from the deck you may discern the place. Where were you bred? And how achieved you these endowments, which you make more rich to own? If I should tell my history, it would seem like lies, disdained in the reporting. Prithee, speak. Falseness cannot come from thee. For thou look'st modest as Justice, and thou seem'st a palace for the crowned truth to dwell in, I will believe thee. And make my senses credit thy relation to points that seem impossible. For thou look'st like, one I loved indeed. What were thy friends? Didst thou not say when I did push thee back which was when I perceived thee that thou camest of good descending? So indeed I did. Report thy parentage. I think thou said'st thou hadst been tossed from wrong to injury and that thou thought'st thy griefs might equal mine, if both were opened. Some such thing I said, and said no more but what my thoughts did warrant me was likely. Tell thy story. If thine considered prove the thousandth part of my endurance, thou art a man and I have suffered like a girl. Yet, thou dost look like patience, gazing on kings' graves, and smiling extremity out of act. What were thy friends? How lost thou them? Thy name, my most kind virgin? Recount, I do beseech you, come sit by me. My name is Marina. Oh, I am mocked, And thou by some incensed god sent hither to make the world to laugh at me. Patience, good sir, or here I'll cease. Nay, I'll be patient. Thou little know'st how thou dost startle me, to call thyself Marina. The name was given me by one who had some power, my father, and a king. How! A king's daughter and called Marina? You said you would believe me. But not to be a troubler of your peace, I will end here. But are you flesh and blood? Have you a working pulse and are no fairy? Motion. Well, speak on. Where were you born? And wherefore called Marina? Called Marina for I was born at sea. At sea! What mother? My mother was the daughter of a king, who died the minute I was born, as my good nurse Lychorida hath oft delivered weeping. Stop there a little! This is the rarest dream that e'er dull sleep did mock sad fools withal. [banging head] This cannot be my daughter, buried! [exhales] Well, where were you bred? I'll hear you more to the bottom of your story and never interrupt you. You scorn, believe me 'twere best I did give o'er. I will believe you by the syllable of what you shall deliver, yet, give me leave. How came you in these parts? Where were you bred? The king, my father did in Tarsus leave me. Till cruel Cleon with his wicked wife did seek to murder me. And having woo'd a villain to attempt it, who having drawn to do it, a crew of pirates came and rescued me, brought me to Mytilene. But, good sir, whither will you have me? Why do you weep? It may be, you think me an impostor. No, good faith, I am the daughter to King Pericles, if good King Pericles be. Ho, Helicanus! Calls my lord? Thou art a grave and noble counselor, most wise in general. Tell me, if thou canst, what this maid is, or what is like to be, that thus hath made me weep? I know not, but here is the regent sir, of Mytilene Speaks nobly of her. She would never tell her parentage, being demanded that, she would sit still and weep. [Pericles groans] Helicanus, strike me royal sir. Give me a gash, put me to present pain. Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me o'erbear the shores of my mortality, and drown me in their sweetness. Oh, come hither, thou that beget'st him that did thee beget, Thou, that wast born at sea, buried at Tarsus, found at sea again! Oh Helicanus, down on thy knees, thank the holy gods as loud as thunder threatens us. This is Marina. What was thy mother's name? Tell me but that, for truth can never be confirmed enough, though doubts did ever sleep. First, sir, I pray, what is your title? I am Pericles of Tyre, but tell me now, my drowned queen's name, as in the rest thou saidst thou hast been godlike perfect, and now the heir of kingdoms and another life to Pericles thy father. Is it no more to be your daughter than to say my mother's name was Thaisa? -[Pericles groans] -Thaisa was my mother, who did end the minute I began. Now, blessings on thee! Rise, [crying] thou art my child. [exclaims] Give me fresh garments. Mine own, Helicanus. She's not dead at Tarsus as she should have been by savage Cleon. She shall tell you, when thou shalt kneel and justify in knowledge she is thy very princess. Who's this? Sir, 'tis the governor of Mytilene who hearing of your melancholy state, did come to see you. I embrace you. Give me my robes! I am wild in my beholding. Heavens bless my girl! -Hark, what music? -[soft distance tune] Tell Helicanus my Marina, tell him o'er point by point, for yet he seems to doubt, how sure you are my daughter. But, what music? My lord, I hear none. None. The music of the spheres! List, my Marina. It is not good to cross him, give him way. Rarest sounds. Do you not hear? Music my lord, I hear. Most heavenly music! It nips me unto listening, and thick slumber hangs upon mine eyes, Let me rest. A pillow for his head. So leave him. [doors creak shut] Well, my companion friends, if this but answer to my just belief, I'll well remember you. [soothing classical music] My temple stands in Ephesus. Hie thee thither, and do upon mine altar sacrifice. There, when my maiden priests are met together, before the people all, reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife. To mourn thy crosses with thy daughter's, call, and give them repetition to the life. Perform my bidding, or thou livest in woe. Do it, and happy, by my silver bow! Awake, and tell thy dream. Celestial Dian, goddess argentine, I will obey thee. [ship creaks] Helicanus! Sir? My purpose was for Tarsus, there to strike the inhospitable Cleon, but I am for other service first. Toward Ephesus turn our blown sails. Eftsoons I'll tell thee why. Shall we refresh us sir, upon your shore, and give you gold for such provision as our intents shall need? Sir, with all my heart, and when you come ashore, I have another suit. You shall prevail. Were it to woo my daughter, for it seems you've been noble towards her. Sir, lend me your arm. Come, my Marina. [footsteps thumping] -[cheerful music] -[fireworks exploding] Now our sands are almost run; more a little, and then dumb. This, my last boon give me, for such kindness must relieve me. That you aptly will suppose, -[fireworks explode] -what pageantry, what feats, what shows, what minstrelsy, and pretty din the regent made in Mytilene to greet the king. So he thrived, that he is promised to be wived to fair Marina. But in no wise till he had done his sacrifice, as Dian bade. Whereto being bound, the interim pray you, all confound. In feathered briefness sails are filled, and wishes fall out as they're willed. -[lively music] -At Ephesus, the temple see, our king and all his company. That he can hither come so soon, is by your fancy's thankful doom. [harmonious singing] Hail, Dian! To perform thy just command, I here confess myself the king of Tyre; Who frighted from my country, did wed at Pentapolis the fair Thaisa. At sea in childbed died she, but brought forth a maid child called Marina, who, oh goddess, wears yet thy silver livery. She at Tarsus was nursed with Cleon. Who at 16 years he sought to murder. But her better stars brought her to Mytilene. 'Gainst whose shore riding, her fortunes brought the maid aboard us, where, by her own most clear remembrance, she made known herself, my daughter. Voice, and favor. You are, you are, Oh royal Pericles! What means the nun? She dies! -Help, gentlemen! -To the lady. Noble sir, if you have told Diana's altar true, this is your wife. Reverend appearer, no. I threw her overboard with these very arms. Upon this coast, I warrant you. 'Tis most certain. Oh, she's but o'erjoy'd. Early one blustering morn, this lady was thrown upon this shore. I oped the coffin, found there rich jewels, recovered her, and placed her here in Diana's temple. May we see them? Great sir, they shall be brought you to my house, whither I invite you. Look, Thaisa is recovered. Oh, let me look! If he be none of mine, my sanctity will to my sense bend no licentious ear, but curb it, spite of seeing. Oh, my lord! Are you not Pericles? Like him you spake, like him you are. Did you not name a tempest, a birth, and death? The voice, of dead Thaisa! -That Thaisa am I, -[uplifting music] supposed dead and drowned. Immortal Dian! Now I know you better. When we with tears parted Pentapolis, the king my father gave you such a ring. This, this. No more, you gods! Your present kindness makes my past miseries sports. You shall do well, that on the touching of her lips, I may melt and no more be seen. Oh, come, be buried a second time within these arms. [Thaisa gasps] My heart leaps to be gone into my mother's bosom. Look, who kneels here! Flesh of thy flesh, Thaisa. That burden at the sea and called, Marina for she was yielded there. Blest! [sniffles] And mine own! [Thaisa and Marina kiss] Hail, madam, and my queen! I know you not. [chuckles] You've heard me say, when I did fly from Tyre, I left behind an ancient substitute, can you remember what I called the man, I have named him oft. 'Twas Helicanus then. Still confirmation, embrace him dear Thaisa, this is he. [Thaisa and Helicanus kiss] Now do I long to hear how you were found, how possibly preserved, and who to thank besides the gods, for this great miracle. Lord Cerimon, my lord. This man, through whom the gods have shown their power, that can from first to last resolve you. Reverend sir, the gods can have no mortal officer more like a god than you. Will you deliver how this dead queen relives? I will, my lord. Beseech you, first go with me to my house, where shall be shown you all was found with her. How she came placed here in the temple, no needful thing omitted. Pure Dian, I bless thee for thy vision! And will offer night-oblations to thee. Thaisa, this prince, the fair-betrothed of your daughter, shall marry her at Pentapolis. And now, this ornament makes me look dismal will I clip to form. And what this many years no razor touched, to grace thy marriage day, I'll beautify. Lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit, sir, my father's dead. Heavens make a star of him! Yet there, my queen, we'll celebrate their nuptials, and ourselves will in that kingdom spend our following days. Our son and daughter shall in Tyrus reign. Lord Cerimon, we do our longing stay to hear the rest untold. Sir, lead us the way. [ceremonial music] In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard of monstrous lust the due and just reward. In Pericles, his queen and daughter seen, although assailed with fortune fierce and keen, virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast, led on by heaven, and crowned with joy at last. In Helicanus may you well descry a figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty. In reverend Cerimon there well appears the worth that learned charity aye wears. For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame had spread their cursed deed to the honored name of Pericles, to rage the city turn, that he and his, they in his palace burn. The gods for murder seemed so content to punish, although not done, but meant. So, on your patience evermore attending, -new joy wait on you! -[joyful music] Here our play hath ending. [joyful music]
