My name's Martin, what's yours? Um, My parents told me not to tell my name to strangers I'm not a stranger, I'm a little boy. Like you. I'm Martin. Oh. Okay, I'm Ethan. Hello Ethan. I'm eight. How old are you? Nine. Dad says I'm too young to be on the computer. So I'm being naughty. No, you're not. Dad says I need friends in the real world. Sometimes, my dad says that too. It's hard making friends. Will you be my friend? There are certain things that only adults do. It's hard making friends. Even clever adults pretend to be children. Ummm... Okay. Where do you live? Very few eight year old's refer to their parents As parents. Very few eight year old's know how to correctly use apostrophes. When I spell basic words. And almost none immediately volunteer To meet up with strangers. Very clever adults forget one thing. Children aren't stupid. I like to play in the park, Do you? I like to play in the woods, no I like to play By the lake near the woods. Somewhere quiet. Somewhere remote. Somewhere you have no place meeting a nine year old boy. Somewhere that proves exactly What you are. I'm going out to play this afternoon. Can I come? I could bring my comic books. Comic books? Jesus christ. Where do you live? I live near chapel woods. Fuck it. Come on man Run you fucking pedo! huh? You can't be too careful. I'm here. Where are you? *sent* I'm playing hide and seek in the woods. Come find me. I said Chapel wood. Shit. My name's Martin. What's yours? My parent's told me not to tell my name to strangers. I'm not a stranger, I'm a little boy. Like you. I'm Martin. Oh, okay. I'm Ethan. Hello Ethan. I'm eight, how old are you? Nine. Dad says I'm too young to be on the computer. So I'm being naughty. No, you're not. Dad says, I need friends in the real world. Sometimes, my dad says that too. It's hard making friends. Will you be my friend? Um, okay. Where do you live? I like to play in the park. Do you? I like to play by the lake, near the woods. I'm going out to play this afternoon. Can I come? I could bring my comic books. Where do you live? I live near Chapel wood. No way! Me too! I'm off to the office. *Dog whining* This is your golden ticket. This is what you wanted. This is better than what you wanted. *click* *click* *click* Oh! No! No! No! No! Oh no! no no no! Please! Sto- stop. Don't Move. Hahahaha! We met here. You can't Get away now you fucking pedophile! I knew straight away. Spotted you a mile How many did you get out here? You fucking monster! How's it feel? How do you like it? Now everyone will know what you've done. I would've liked to have lived longer Just to watch you die. No! Hey. Help! Okay. You've won. This doesn't have to be the end. I've been attacked by a pedophile. With a hunting knife. May be dying. Might have killed him in self defence. Okay. Now nobody is gonna know this guy isn't a pedophile. He had A terrifying Kill/Rape kit. Stalked me thru the woods. Thinking I was a child. He even covered me in petrol. Two. What this guy said doesn't necessarily mean he wasn't The child abuser. He came here to commit a crime. A rape, Arsen, a murder. Who really knows? May lose consciousness. But will continue reporting until I do. Three. This story is viable. and scale able. If you breath slowly, and stay afloat. You can survive. But if you Don't, You'll be the first to hear of all the live tweeters on death. From the scene of a crime. Okay. If I die. I died doing What I love. Uncovering the truth. Trying to make the world A better place. You should too. Either way. I'll be in every newspaper and website in the world tomorrow morning. I'm praying for you now. Stay brave. Please, don't die. P.S, Stab that piece of shit for me one more time. He deserves to burn in hell. Congratulations, dummy. You made it.
