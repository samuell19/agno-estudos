Man: His name is raun-- raun Kaufman. He's my son, and this is his story. It's a true story, and it begins as all stories-- at birth. Five years ago and what seemed like another lifetime, this was my office where I did advertising campaigns for movies. Most of the time it was challenging and creative - as it was that day... - What is it? ...the day raun was born. Suzi's having contractions! [ Gasps ] Oh god. - Uh, Jeanette--? - Here it is. - I called the garage. They're getting your car out. - You are a great woman. - Man: Barry! - What? - Luck luck! - Lots of it. [ Horn honks ] - Huh-uh. This one's on the house. - Aw, thanks, Larry! Good luck. - Woman: Okay, suzi. - [ Breathing ] Now take a deep breath. Okay, let it out. Suzi: They're closer together. - Where's-- - your husband's on his way. Mr. Kaufman, hurry! - How-- how-- - it's okay. It's okay. She's fine. - Good. - Get in there. Good! Good, suzi. Okay, now deep breathing, all right? And one two three four... [ Singing ] ♪ one two three four ♪ one two three four ♪ ♪ one two three four ♪ one two three four ♪ - Hi, Barry. - Hiya, doc. - Oh, bears, I was afraid you'd be late. - Not a chance. Just follow the music. Oh, I love his singing. Well, of course. Birth is a joy. That's why I became an obstetrician. Can you imagine a proctologist singing? [ Vocalizing ] Suze, three and four. One two three. - One two three four. - [ Doctor continues vocalizing ] [ Singing opera ] Barry: Push, honey, push. - Pant, honey, pant. - [ Panting ] Okay, babe, here we go. Push! - [ Grunting ] - A little more, honey. Come on. Yeah. One more time. That's it, suzi. Oh my god. It's coming. [ Suzi shouts ] Oh, babe. [ Baby crying ] Baby! Like all miracles, perfect. - Suzi: A boy. - A perfect baby boy. Doctor: A perfect baby boy. [ Laughing, shouting ] [ Raun crying ] Girl: There's mommy with raun! Barry: Our two daughters are Bryn and thea. Mommy, why does raun cry so much? Suzi: Oh, I don't know, baby. I guess because he's restless. Poor baby. Barry: Bryn at seven already feels motherly... He's noisy. ...and thea at four and a half... He's very noisy. ...is fully prepared to speak her mind. Nancy's 16. Originally, she came to US as a mother's helper from an unhappy home. Now she lives with US and she's a part of our family for as long as she needs US. And like all of US, she's worried about raun. Let me hold that little guy, suzi. Oh, come on, raunchie. What did the pediatrician say? Well, he changed the formula again. Said it was colic again. - Well, maybe he'll be better this time. - Yeah. - Barry: It wasn't. - [ Crying continues ] He had two ear infections, then became severely dehydrated. Our little boy almost died. Raun's retaining some fluids now, but he's still dehydrated. As for the ear infection, we'll just have to let it run its course. - Is he dying? - No, he's fighting. And I think he's winning, but... Well, both his eardrums have burst. I think you should both be prepared. He may be deaf. Barry: He recovered. He didn't seem deaf. We weren't sure, but the important thing is raun was back with US. We all gathered for raun's birthday party-- me, suzi, Nancy, the girls, my father and stepmother. Pop was recording it all for history. Suzi: Look at that, raun. There's your birthday cake. [ Camera shutter clicks ] Stepmother: Oh, that's a beautiful shot. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ happy birthday, dear raunchie ♪ ♪ happy birthday ♪ to you. [ Clapping ] Hey, raun, birthday boy. Suzi: Look at the cake, and then what do you do? Raun? Blow out the candles. [ Both blowing ] Barry: Suzi and I were concerned. He blanked out sometimes. As if... As if nobody else existed for him, but then he'd come back to US like a night rider. The doctors kept telling US he'd outgrow whatever it was, so we listened, at least for now, and watched and waited. Raun! Nancy: Raun! He heard me when I came out here before. - I was talking to him. I know he heard me. - Barry: Raun! - Nancy: Raun. - Stepmother: Baby, what's the matter, honey, huh? Sweetheart, raun? Barry: Raun! I gotta tell you, Barry-o, it's a knockout. - Thanks, Grady. - Your husband is outrageously expensive, suzi. Yeah, but he's so good, he's a bargain, right? He gives the picture a really classy look. I'm very proud of this campaign, Barry. Thanks, Grady. What did you think of the film? It'll make money. That's the big answer. Well, that's the big answer, Barry-o. Yeah, but what's the big question, huh? You know, it really is a terrific poster. Maybe we should distribute the advertising campaign and just forget the film. Maybe we should just forget the party and the screening and go home. That's a great idea. Come on. - Hey! - I gotta run, Grady. Got a hot call from coppola. Yeah, he's got redford, Newman, Hoffman and Streisand. And a big cameo for Gary Cooper. He's dead! That's why we gotta hurry. [ Thumping sound ] [ Thumping continues ] Raunchie. Sweet baby. Raun, we're here with you. Baby. Sweetheart. I suppose they'll say that this is just a normal phase that he'll grow out of. Well, I don't buy it. We've been through chickenpox, measles, strep throat with the girls. This just doesn't feel right. All right, we'll take him for a complete series of tests tomorrow. We'll take him to children's hospital. [ Electronic tones playing ] Well? Your son does not hear. Maybe he's too young to understand the test. There are involuntary reactions to sound: Pupils, eyelids, the skin. Now with your son, there weren't any. But he does respond to sound. I know he hears sometimes. Now I won't argue with you, Mrs. Kaufman, but right now, here today, your son does not hear. [ Sings tones ] ♪ da da da. Mommy, are you a sculptor or a sculptress? Well, I guess I'm neither one. I'm just me. Raunchie, do you like spinning the plate, watching it spin? Would you look at me if I took it away? He's inside of his head, mommy. Barry: I had to find out what was wrong with my son. It would take research, digging, probing, reading, searching for answers. Hiya. Hi, Barry, sorry to disturb you. Oh, that's all right. What's up? Daddy, I'm gonna sleep over at joanie's house, remember? Of course I remember, of course. I'll bring her back tomorrow. - Why can't I ever have a sleepover? - Oh! When you're a little more grown up. Goodbye, daddy. Goodbye, honey. You have a good time. - Okay, bye. - Bye, sweetheart. Barry, how's it going with raun? [ Sighs ] Sometimes I feel he's just... Slipping away. Raun, you can hear, but only sometimes. You can see, but only certain things. Nothing else. Raunchie... Where are you? Where do you go? Where? Suze, I think I've found something. - What? - I'm not sure. I picked this up from the university medical library. Who does this sound like? "Antisocial and aloof patterns of activity; no verbal communication; appears blind and deaf at times; hypnotic preoccupation with spinning, rocking and repetitive movements; the appearance of looking through people." What are you saying? Autism. All the descriptions fit. Brain damage? Is that what you mean? I mean all the descriptions fit raun as an autistic child. No no. You're just guessing, Barry. [ Plate rattles ] [ Sighs ] Autism, autistic... What does that mean? He's alone in his own world. - I know that. - Suze, I mean literally in his own world. He can't handle the input from ours-- all the colors, movements, sounds-- so he's blanked it out. In raun's world, the only living creature is raun. But he knows me, US. Suze, in his world, we're just objects. He literally doesn't know we're alive. But we feed him. We take care of him. Love him. Food comes from you or it comes from a refrigerator. He rocks in my arms or in a crib. It doesn't make any difference. He can't tell the difference. He hears sounds, engines, music, people talking, dogs barking. It's all the same. He can't tell the difference. Okay, so what else does the book say? Barry, I want to know. "Infantile autism... Considered the most irreversible of the profoundly disturbed and psychotic." Another book called it a brain disorder where thinking and perception never come together. Okay. But we don't really know that he's autistic. No, but we have to find out. Woman: Yes, he's a classic case of autism. Suzi: But why raun? We don't have any explanations as to why this happens to one child and not another. What we do have is a diagnostic list of autistic behaviors. And raun exhibits 12 out of the 13 key actions. I don't think we've ever had a positive diagnosis of autism in a child so young. It's remarkable. Is there any treatment? Oh, a complex of treatments. There's workshops and therapy sessions and modification techniques. It's a long, difficult process. Well, when do we start, doctor? Oh, but we don't take children until they're at least three years old and toilet trained. But by then raun will be 10 times harder to reach. Mrs. Kaufman, he is already almost impossible to reach and that will not change. There would be no difference if we were to begin now or two years from now. At best, raun will learn a few minimal tasks, if you're lucky. Wait a minute, wait a minute, Dr. Field. Are you saying that autism is not curable? It-it's not treatable? I'm saying that we can't offer you much hope. I'm sorry. Thank you. I'm sorry. [ Panting ] I hate that label, "autistic child"-- classifying him, putting him in a box and slamming the lid down. Raun isn't in a prison. He's at peace inside that world of his. We just have to show him a way out. Sometimes when i'm with him... It's like trying to find someone in a... A funhouse mirror maze. I see him. I try to touch him. But it's just a reflection. My hand doesn't reach him. But I know he's in there somewhere. But how do you reach through the glass without shattering it? There aren't any quick answers. I'm not looking for a miracle. Just a beginning. Just a place to start. So I've asked Dr. Ramsay to sit in on this one. He's our chief of psychiatric services with a specialty in pediatrics. Thank you. Now we would like to examine the boy alone, if you don't mind. Uh, uh, excu-- - Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Kaufman. - Yes. Hi, I'm Ms. Marcum, and I'll be the social worker assigned to your case. - Won't you sit down? - Thank you. Well, you know how it is. Always forms to fill out. Now father's name? Barry Neil Kaufman. - Place of birth? - New York City. Father's name, mother's maiden name? Ms. Marcum, we've done this. We've filled out forms. What does this have to do with raun? Well, I don't decide that, Mrs. Kaufman, but we do require this information. My father s name is Abe. Abraham. Did either of your parents have a history of mental illness? - No. - Has either of you had a nervous breakdown? No, but give US a few minutes. How did you meet? In the beginning? Yes, we'd like a-- well, a profile of your courtship, marriage, that sort of thing. Well, a friend introduced US. I was nervous. I was 17. As opposed to me, a sophisticated man of the world. After our first date, I couldn't stop thinking about him. I had this sense of inevitability. It was silly. But I put it down on paper. I wrote it down in a letter. "I don't know why, but I have this feeling that I'm gonna marry you, and I'm not all that sure that I'm delighted about the idea." - What a cunning ploy. - It was not! It was too, and it worked. In a way. My god, I was terrified. And I told you, "you can't marry me. I don't know who I am yet. I'm angry. I'm egotistical. I'm complicated. I'm trouble! - You don't want to get involved with me." - Right. - But then what happened? - What do you think? He kept telling me what a lousy risk he was until I married him and found out he was right. He's arrogant, egotistical, troublesome. But a fantastic lover. And we lived interestingly - ever after. - Yeah. Okay? Yes, there'll be just a few more questions. - "Autistic. No eye--" - [ Knocks ] "No eye contact. Language and socialization skills: Infantile." Your son functions at less than one-third his age level. We set his IQ at below 30. Barry: Okay. But can you help him in your program? Not a child this young. Perhaps in a year, year and a half. But why not try now? If we could just make contact. Mrs. Kaufman, at best raun will only function minimally. He probably will never talk. To hope for more is destructive fantasizing. Accept the truth. Perhaps later we can talk about placing him - in a facility. - Facility? You mean an institution? A psychiatric prison. That's very melodramatic, Mr. Kaufman. That's very clinical, Dr. Wills, and that's the problem here. You're discussing an intriguing case of infantile autism. I'm talking about our son. Mrs. Kaufman, surely you can't agree with this attitude. No, Dr. Ramsey, I don't. I think that my husband was unforgivably polite. Ooh, I hate them. I really do. So cold and unfeeling. I just can't stand it. [ Screams ] Feel better? Not yet. I just need something different. I need something to warm my soul. Coming up. This is really crazy. We've just been told our son's a basket case and we're sitting here drinking champagne. Isn't it better than getting angry or feeling guilty or asking why this is happening? Bears, it is happening. Yeah, but it's happening to US now. Suze, can you-- can you imagine trying to cope with this seven or eight years ago? I don't even want to think about it. We're different people now. We've chosen to live a certain way, with love. And acceptance. We can deal with this now. I know. And remember, we've just started to ask for help. We'll make lists. We'll check out every possibility. Somebody's gotta have some answers. Answers. Suzi: Yes, I see. And where is it in Baltimore exactly? Uh-huh. Could you give me that address just one more time, I'm sorry. Uh-huh. "1806." yes. Thank you. Thank you. I got that. [ Whispers ] Hi, honey. And I would appreciate anything you could send me specifically on autistic children. Yes yes, I've got it. Thank you. Bye-bye. Mommy, what did dody's mother mean when she said raun was a tragedy? Well, I guess that raun's different from other children, and she thought that was bad. Sometimes when people talk about a situation that they'd feel bad about if it ever happened to them, they call that a tragedy. Do you think it's bad or sad that your brother's different? No. I mean, is it that he can't talk? It's hard for him. Suzi: That's right. Raun's just sort of lost. He's inside himself. I guess because that's where he feels most comfortable. Is he sick? No, we don't like to think of him as sick. He just sort of has a lot of trouble understanding things. When will he get better? I don't know. That's the truth, Bryn. We're gonna try to help him, to reach him. We're gonna try. Can I help? Oh, baby. You know you're already helping. [ Knock on door ] Will you get that, honey? - [ Squeals ] - Hiya, pumpkin. Hey, what are you doing home so early? I wasn't doing much good at the office so I hit a few libraries-- research. Hiya. Daddy, daddy, daddy! Ooh, that's pretty. That's real pretty. Hi, raun. This is your father speaking. How's it going? Oh, terrific. There's a place that has sensory stimulation and patterning in Baltimore. And then in the midwest, there's a clinic that works almost entirely with autistic children, and I didn't get through to the institute in San Francisco. - Why not? - The line was busy. I'll get to it. Barry: Look at him. Serene. I wonder what's in his world that's so much more fascinating than ours. Maybe someday he'll tell US. [ Banging continues ] If I can just get through to him, just once make contact. What about the fredericks clinic, did you make the appointment with Dr. Danner? I forgot all about it. I was so busy talking to Baltimore. Suze, you know every lead is crucial. I know that. Well, maybe you should make a list. Barry, I don't need to make a list. It's important, suze. You read the article on Dr. Danner. I know how important it is, Barry. I know just how important it is. Now stop pushing at me. Just stop pushing! Okay, what is it? A peace offering. No jokes. Now you can't keep pushing at me, Barry. All these lists, research, phoning-- - I'm doing the best I can. - I know that. Bull! - You're running me like you run your business. - You're right. You're absolutely right. You are not my business. You are my wife, and I'm sorry I pushed you. I know. It's just that sometimes I'd like to forget I'm a grownup. Sometimes I think I'm responsible for the way raun is. Suzi, don't. You know how I have my conversations with god? Well, before the girls were born, all I asked was that they be healthy. It's all I could think about. And then when I got pregnant the third time, all I could think about was how much I wanted a boy. A son. I just asked for a son. I never once thought to ask that he be healthy. You think you did it? I don't know. [ Sighs ] Now, suze, you asked for what you thought was important. That didn't mean you didn't want a healthy boy. I think with all his brains, god knew that. Huh? Oh, baby. Everybody, can I have your attention, please? Pop, roz, herb-- everybody, please. Herb. You're being very formal tonight, Barry. What's up? We have a little favor to ask. Granted. Where's the liverwurst? Herb, suzi and I are gonna be visiting a number of clinics, special schools that treat autism and... Well, we're gonna be away from home for a while. And you're recruiting substitute mommies and daddies. What a way to put it. I'll be here, but we all thought-- you don't have to be scared. We'll show you where everything is. In that case, we've got a deal. Barry, suzi, I'm flattered you asked. Of course. Now wait a minute. I don't think you really understand what we're asking. We just answered. Now just one question. Name it. When do I get my liverwurst? - Coming up, herb. - Abraham: Barry. - Barry. - Yeah, pop. I want to tell you, I'm very impressed. You and suzi are handling this thing very sensibly. - Businesslike. - Thanks, pop. Well, now look here, if there's anything I can do. Thanks, I'll ask. I've got no shame. Good. Let's hope to god he can be helped. Barry: We headed out like explorers in a strange jungle. The first place was a special school. They used behavior modification and aversion therapy. Now this is one of our classrooms. - We have several. - Woman: No! No! The treatment is aimed at resocializing and discontinuing deviant and undesirable behavior. Don, eat the food with the spoon. Don, eat the food with the spoon. No no no no! Woman: I know it seems severe, but that child will eventually learn to eat with a spoon, although he'll probably never talk or relate to others. Don, eat the food with the spoon. The football helmet is to protect his skull if he slams it against a wall. Does he do it a lot? He's fractured his skull three times in the past two years. The abrasions on his scalp required 197 stitches. He's self-destructive. How old is your child? Raun's not quite two. Oh, well, then you probably have time before this sort of thing comes up. [ Girl shrieking ] What are they doing to that little girl? She's being timed out. When a child's behavior becomes disruptive, we remove them from the group and isolate them briefly. It's a disciplinary measure. Well, I'm happy to have been of help. The administrative offices and exit are right out this way. - Both: Thank you. - [ Shrieking continues ] [ Banging ] Our guidance techniques help children relive infancy. We're bringing that child through the crawling phase. [ Whimpering ] And with this one we're simulating the womb experience. [ Child shouts ] We'll be going this way next. I hope what you have seen is useful, Mr. Kaufman, Mrs. Kaufman. And when your child is one year older, we'd be happy to evaluate him. Well, thank you, Dr. Samms. We would have liked to have seen more than one child. I understand, but you see, we respect our patients' privacy. And besides, lay persons don't always understand the technical details. - Have a good trip. - Thank you. Thank you, doctor. What? Come on. - Bears! - Shh! - What are you doing? - Now, suze, I know a p.R. Job when it hits me. [ Girl whimpering ] [ Shouts ] [ Claps, shouts ] - Oh my god. - Come on. What is it? Electric shock equipment. Oh, god, bears, I've had enough. Let's get out of here. - [ Thumps ] - [ Child moans ] No. Just stay right there. - [ Machine whirring ] - [ Child moaning ] It's junk. It's garbage. It's cheap pornography. What's wrong with selling a movie? - The client wants to hype it up. - Ask the client if he realizes that a lying campaign isn't poor ethics. - It's dumb economics. - Barry, you know what he's gonna say. Okay, tell him to see me and we'll argue it out then. Okay, you're the boss. Talk about dumb economics. I was in business for 40 years. I learned you give the client what he's ready to pay for. Sure, except then he thinks he owns you. I don't intend to be owned. My son, the professional rebel-- business, lifestyle, even to getting medical help for raun. Pop, I told you what happened, what suzi and I saw. What you saw. Are you a doctor? How do you interpret what you saw? No, I'm not a doctor. I'm raun's father! I saw kids being manipulated, being coerced, being drugged, being shocked! There isn't a medical explanation good enough for me. What are you gonna do? Invent a magic serum? I don't know what we're gonna do, but I do know where we're gonna start. Raun's a baby. He's not violent. He's not self-destructive. We want to try to reach him now. We-- you and suzi. Obviously nobody else believes they can. How? How are you gonna do it, hmm? I don't know, pop. I don't know. But I do know one thing, we're not gonna judge his behavior as being good or bad. We're gonna start by watching the only expert we have-- raun. Barry: We're gonna follow him from the moment he wakes up till he goes to sleep. Suzi will take notes. I'll take pictures. We'll get a view from every side, how he plays, what he likes, dislikes, what he reacts to, what he reacts against... 'Cause only raun can give US the answers. [ Camera shutter clicking ] Look, in all these photos he's walking on his toes. Suzi: He's so beautiful. Over here and here, he seems to be moving away from the sounds instead of towards it. Barry: Those eyes, they just haunt me. We had begun to work with raun, studying him. As the first step to understanding him, we had to find a way of reaching him. Hey, raunch. - [ Bell ringing ] - Raunch. Raunchie? [ Musical toy playing ] [ Music stops ] Raunchie, hey. Look at this. [ Banging ] Raun, raunchie. Hey, raunchie, hey. Hey, raunchie. [ Telephone ringing ] [ Rings ] - Thanks, hon. - You're welcome. - Suze? - Yeah? I came down a while ago and I saw you. What were you doing? - You mean the rocking? - Yeah. Bears, it was so strange. I was sitting down there with him and I didn't know what to do. And I wanted to say to him, "listen, it's okay. I'm not judging you. I accept you," but I just didn't know how to do it. And then I sort of let myself go and you saw. It was like you were trying to be with him, where he is, wherever he is. I wanted him to know that whatever he does, wherever he is, it's okay. It feels good. It's good. It's good, suzi, I mean it. Maybe that's the way to get through to him. I just wish there weren't so many distractions. I know. Yesterday I noticed whenever anybody came into the room, he became even more withdrawn. Now if we could just find someplace else to work with him. With the door and the girls and the phone... - I've got just the place. - Where? - You're gonna laugh. Come on, come on. - What? - Come on, come on! - What? [ Suze laughing ] You see, it's small and quiet. No distractions. What do you think? I think it's crazy. You do? I think it'll work. Come on, lady, don't stand around. We gotta strip this. Barry: This was it. The beginning of we didn't know what-- an experiment, a mistake, a dream. Hello, raunchie. Welcome to your world. It's a nice room, raunchie. Yeah, look at that ceiling. Your mama loves you very very much. Know what i'm gonna do, raunchie? I'm gonna sit down real close, and I'm not gonna touch you. You're gonna sit down real close and i'm gonna rock too. Let's see what this feels like, okay? Barry: She was with him constantly. From his waking up to his bedtime, they were together in this quiet place. While suzi worked with him all day, I observed as much as possible, and each night, we'd share our observations, following his cues for direction, sometimes talking till 3:00 in the morning. And I spent special times with the girls, offsetting suzi's work with raun. We didn't know if it would work at all, but suzi knew she loved her son and she wanted to work with him. I knew the work was brutally hard for her, difficult for all of US. Here comes your food. Barry: As the therapy continued, we began to keep a record, a log-- the journey of raun. "Log, eighth week. Schedule: 75 hours per week. We note more facial expression. Raun pushes away from physical contact. He smiles but only to himself. Always self-stimulating, spinning, rocking, he stares constantly." It's okay. If you don't want me to touch you, I won't. ♪ It's okay ♪ it's okay ♪ raunchie doesn't want me to touch him ♪ ♪ so I won't. Good morning, raun. Happy anniversary. It's one month.

Barry: "Log, ninth week. Suzi's making some progress with eye contact and raun shows more interest in puzzles and games. We're starting to use music. I wanna do more with raun. I also wanna spend more time with the girls." Bryn! Bryn? Bryn! Hey. I'm not that late. No, daddy, I just-- I have my books right here. Now nobody just starts crying. What is it? Hmm? Well, come on, pumpkin, there's a reason. Tell me. Some of the other kids, did they say anything to upset you? Oh, no. I mean, some of them ask questions about raun, but I explain: It's just hard for him to talk to US or look at US, or play with thea and me. Mm-hmm. It's not that. It was just Karen Jacobson. Her mom came to pick her up, and brought her little brother. He was just like raun except-- well? We were playing with him and he was having a terrific time, but when I try to play with raun, he won't. Daddy, maybe it's me. Maybe I did something. [ Crying ] Oh no, it's not you. It's nobody's fault. Oh, pumpkin. Look, there is no reason to get upset with ourselves, or raun. He's doing the best he can. He loves US. He just doesn't know how to show it yet. Will he ever? I hope so. Hello, sweet baby. Raunchie. Here's some cottage cheese. Yeah, you love cottage cheese, don't you? That's good, raun. How about some music? Let's listen to some nice classical music. [ Music playing quietly ] Barry: "10th week, far more social interaction. Actually seems to seek out human contact. Still spinning but can move to music. We ran a language test. Raun now responds to a total of 21 words. A very positive sign." Do you wanna be a dancer? Barry: "Schedule, 75 hours per week. Suzi isn't getting enough sleep. She works with raun all day, and prepares and reviews for hours with me each night." You could be anything. Little raunchie can be any person he wants to be, any person in the whole world. Yes, he could. Barry: "Log, 11th week. Raun more socialized. Beginning to make more contact, but still inconsistent, an enigma." You know, raunchie, sometimes I have a feeling this is the world-- you and me. Do you know it's Sunday? It's the day of rest. Happy Sunday, raunchie. That's okay, baby. You don't want me to touch you, I won't touch you. You hungry? You hungry, raunchie baby? Here's some food. Okay. It's okay. We'll just rock some now. That's okay, raunchie. Barry: Trying to touch raun is like trying to find the most loving part within ourselves. Suzi's operating on Patience and love, but she's tired most of the time now and I want her to slow down, take some time off. Maybe Nancy could be trained to help. Suzi needs rest. I tried to reach him through food today. That seems to be the only thing he's interested in. Well, each time is the first time. No connections. He simply can't hold it in his mind. When it's out of sight, it's gone. It never happened. He's got to make connections. Would you like some help around here? I'm okay. I want to work with raun for a while, all right? Okay, raunchie. Here we go. Come on, we're gonna go to work. Okay, here we go. I can manage, Nance. Listen, finish your homework. No, I wanna help! Okay. What else is it? Nance, come on, tell me. It's just that... I know, suzi, you've got a whole lot to worry about with raun, you know, and... I know you don't need another problem. I'm a whole other problem for you. Nancy, no. I'm doing lousy in school and I don't know what to do about it. It just doesn't seem like anything goes real right for me, you know? And that's not real fair to you and Barry. I've been thinking, you know, and you ought to tell me to leave. It's just... I'm really scared. [ Sobbing ] Oh, Nancy. Listen, you have every right to decide what you wanna do with your life, okay? But we want you to stay, you hear? We love you, Nancy. Did you get it all out? Yeah, I'm sorry. Listen, Nance, would you be willing to help me out with raun? Oh, could I? You think I could? Yeah, I think so. You're part of the family, and god knows I could use the help. Oh, yeah yeah. Sure, I'd love to. Thank you. Okay. Now go finish your homework. Yeah, okay. Barry: "Log. Before Nancy began working with raun, I spent days talking to her about what we were doing and why; most important, about an accepting attitude." - Nancy's gonna help. - Hey, raunch. Wanna show Nancy how to do it? - Nancy's gonna spin with US, raunch. - I'm nervous. Good, terrific. That's it. Oh, you're a good boy. You're getting real good at this. Now watch, watch. Watch, darling. Can you do that? Barry: Raun was now actively involved in music, - more responsive. - Good boy. We've heard about some interesting work being done at the university research center on autism. I'm gonna follow it up. That was fun, huh? You wanna try that? Okay, raunchie, I'm gonna put these blocks up here. See? Look. Doesn't that look like fun? You see that? Do you wanna help, raunchie? Here, darling. Here. Okay. Okay, I'll rock with you then. I'll rock just like you do. I love you, raunchie. Look at me, daddy! Whoa! Waa! Oh! Are you hurt? No no, honey. Didn't you know bears like to sit on ice? Hey, Bryn, honey. What do you say we take a break, huh? - Okay. - Okay, let's go. [ Groaning ] - Oop, there. - Okay. Here we go. Did you know mommy let me put raun to sleep last night? Uh-huh, and I understand you did a terrific job too. Bryn, what do you think about you and thea helping out with raun? Really? Oh, daddy! I'd love to. - Daddy? - Hmm? Remember that day at school? Uh-huh. I didn't mean to cry. Really I didn't. I wanna be strong, strong like you and mommy. Crying doesn't mean you're not strong, baby. It's okay to cry. I just want him to get better. So do I. Okay, let's skate, huh? Whoa whoa! Barry: "Log, week 14. Raun and suzi are still spinning. Suzi's become an expert at his games. Still no verbal communication from raun, but now there's something very different about him." Raunchie? You're looking at me. Raunchie! Oh, dear god. Oh, baby. Sweet baby. You looked at me. Raunchie, you good little boy. Such a good little boy. Yes, you are. Mommy loves you so much, raunchie. Yes, you're so good. Yes, you are. Mommy loves you so much, raunchie. ♪ Patty cake, Patty cake, baker's man ♪ ♪ bake me a cake fast as you can ♪ ♪ bat it and roll it and put it in a pan ♪ ♪ Patty cake, Patty cake, baker's man ♪ Barry: "Log, week 15. It seems to US that raun's floodgates are open. The progress over this period is breathtaking." Which one? "Raun was willing to communicate with everyone. He still has no words but somehow that didn't seem to get in his way." Try it again. Put it back in. Oh, you're getting too smart. Hey, that's a good boy. Okay, now... Raunchie? Can you take this out? Good, raunchie, that's good. Put it down there. Right there. That's good, raunchie. That's very good. This is a circle, and there's a circle place in this puzzle. You try to fit it in there. Good, raunchie. You're looking at me. I love you. [ Blows notes ] Barry: We were feeling very good about his progress and wanted to share our knowledge. Suze, this is Dr. Clark. Hi, Bob Clark, university research center. We're all set and ready to go, Dr. Clark. - Bob. - Bob. I'm not sure what you expect. We sort of worked all this out as we went along. I mean, I don't know how you'll judge it, the idea of a parental therapy program. Mrs. Kaufman, I think the idea's fantastic. Great. Okay. Well, I'll go get raun. There's not much room in here. Where would you like to set up? This'll do. Oh. That's right, raun. There's a strange man in our bathtub. You see that? That's a camera. We're not gonna worry about any of that. We're gonna sit right here on the floor, just like we always do. Yeah, just sit here and we'll rock. Raun? Where's your nose? Can you touch your nose, raun? Not my nose, you little silly raunchie. Raunchie raun's nose. Let me see raunchie raun's nose. Yes, that's terrific! What a good little boy! Yes, what a good boy, raunchie. That's a duck, huh? Look at this little duck. [ Quacking ] Look at that duck, raunchie. Where do you suppose this guy goes? Where would you put this guy? No, you put-- yeah. Yeah, like turning it around and then there it goes. What a good try. That was a real good try, raunchie. That was great. See this little guy? What is this? [ Barks ] It's a dog, huh? [ Barks ] See this dog? Where would that go, raunchie? Where would you stick that dog? No, maybe it goes over here a little bit. [ Barks ] It goes right in there, yeah. Twist it around just a little, yeah. That's terrific, raunchie. What a good little boy. How come you're so good? See the ball? See the ball? Try to catch it. Catch the ball, raunchie. Catch the ball, raunchie. Catch it. See if you can catch it. Catch the ball, raunchie. Look at the ball, raunchie. Look at it. Look at the ball, raunchie. Look at the ball. Look at that ball. Try to catch it. Try to catch it. Catch the ball. That's terrific! - That was really good. - He did it. He really did it. That was really good, raunchie. Yes, that was good. It was real real good. Damn, I am impressed. And the really startling thing-- raun's a happy kid. I'm used to seeing a lot of anger, anxiety in these children. What about language development? I mean, right now, he makes noise but they're just noises, not words. Let me talk to Dr. Johnson. He's our head of service. He's done a lot of work in this area. I've seen the tapes and had several talks with Dr. Clark. We don't feel that your son is ready for language development at this time. But why? He understands me and he tries to speak. That's your interpretation, Mrs. Kaufman, as a layperson. That's also the conclusion of people who've worked intensively with raun for over three months, Dr. Johnson. Worked? Yes. By imitating his autistic behavior. I'm afraid we can't agree with that approach. It may well simply reinforce inappropriate behavior patterns. Doctor, why would you want to judge a child's behavior as inappropriate or bad just because it's different? What we're doing reaches raun. He responds. Dr. Clark: Suzi, Barry, please. We've had a whole series of discussions. I've been outvoted... So far. Maybe if you brought raun in when he's older. Thank you but we've been through that before. We'd like to try to reach raun now while he's still young. Six months or a year could make all the difference, and we don't want to take that chance. Yes, I see. Of course it is your child. That's right. No, wait a minute, that's not quite right. Raun's not an "it." He's our son, and that's why we'll do everything in our power to reach him. There you go. Use both hands. Good boy! Good boy. Okay. [ Dog whines ] [ Barks ] Suzi: Here it comes. Here it comes. Those are good bubbles, huh? Here it comes. Got it! That was good, raunch. ♪ Raunchie raun, raunchie raun ♪ ♪ gonna sit right here on the floor, little raunchie. ♪ You can play with these blocks, see? Mommy will fix you some lunch. Then we can play some ball. You like that, raunchie? Play some ball? Yeah. Yes, you're such a good boy, huh? Yes, that's my good sweet boy. [ Crying ] Raunchie! Baby, do you want some juice? Raunch? Do you want juice to drink? This? Yes. Get raunchie a glass. Juice? Juice? You want-- oh, raunchie, baby, you asked for juice, you good boy. - Fun? No. - Excuse me, I'm sorry. Keep talking. I see a campaign that links together - a sense of place with a sense of thrust. - Barry here. What? He did? Babes, I'll be right there! - What's wrong? - I'm sorry, my son just asked for juice. - He asked for what? - My son, he asked for juice! And youhave to get it for him? Okay, here's the car. Where's the car go? Figure it out. Where does the car go? Bears! - He did it! - He did it? - He did it. - Nancy: Here's the car. Where's the car go? - Let's try it. - Oh, bears, he did one thing. - That doesn't mean he can-- - suze, I'm not expecting any miracles. - Whatever he does is okay. Let's let him decide. - Okay, all right. - Nance? - Oh, of course he can do it. You can do anything you want, can't you? Go ahead. Well, he tried. Shoot. Suzi: Oh! He remembered! He made the connection! Raunchie, yay! You're a genius, my baby. There's an article. I think it's in the bedroom. All right, you stay right there now. That's you, raunchie.

Nancy: Look at how good your little brother's getting. Where's he going? Let's follow him. We've been playing ball. - Oh, yeah? - Oh yeah, he's getting real good too. You should see him. He can even roll a curve. - [ Crying ] - Suzi: Raunchie's terrific. Aren't you, raunch? Juice? - I'll get it. - Thanks. Coming up, coming up. Here I am. Juice? Juice? Huh? - Hmm, I don't think he wants it. - What do you want, raun? Oh, I see somebody here wants juice. No, we don't know what he wants. Not juice. You want a cookie? One cookie, coming up. Raun: Wuh-- wuh-- wuh-- Uhh-- ahh-- wah-- wah-- wah-- wah-- suzi: Water! - Oh my god! - Get him a glass of water! Water? Raunchie, water? Water? Did you say water? That was so good! That's water! Water! [ All talking excitedly ] Okay, here comes your water, raunchie. - Down! - Down? D-Down down! Raunchie! Water! [ Quacking ] - Duck. - A duck, that's right. Where would you put that duck? Yes! Push it, push it. That's right, raunchie. That was real good. Okay, what is this? - A duck. - [ Neighs ] No, listen to this. [ Neighs, sputters ] What is that? - Horse. - Yes, it's a horse. Where are you gonna put that horse, raunchie? Yes! How come you're such a smart raunchie? Let's see. This. [ Barking ] - Dog. - Yes, that's a doggie. Put him in. Where would you put him? Dog goes right there in his little house. Yes, raunchie's so good. What a little-- good raunchie! [ Laughing ] Wah. Coming up, raunchie. Down! You want down. Okay, big boy. He's demanding, isn't he? Oh, you're getting-- you're getting heavy. Okay. Oh, here you go, raunchie. Here's your water. Thattaboy. Ball. Okay, raun, you wanna play? - Come on. - It's my turn. - Okay. - Ball! - Here, we can both play. - Okay. Oh, pop and roz will be here in the morning. He's usually so laid-back. I don't think I've ever heard him so excited before. - What did he say? - I don't know. Some craziness about giving US a nobel prize. [ Plate spinning ] My god, what happened? Raunchie, baby. Barry: Raun had reverted quite unexpectedly-- no eye contact, no response, nothing. He pulled away from US back deep into himself. We'd have to start over again. "Log, 16th week. Raun is withdrawn as when we began. So we too begin at his beginning, where he was, rocking, spinning with him, letting him know that wherever he is, it's okay with US." That's my raunchie. I love you, raunchie. I don't understand it. The whole thing is crazy. - It is totally insane. - It's my business, Dan. Exactly, so how can you walk out on it? It's what I wanna do, Danny. I wanna be with raun even more than I am now. I don't understand how a guy can walk out on a growing, successful business. I've got enough money saved. Oh, for how long? Long enough. Enough to find out how long is enough. You mean it for real? Yes. - Okay. - No more arguments? What's the use? I keep arguing with you and I get scared. You begin to sound sensible. That frightens me. Hey, Barry, I hope you're right. You're doing a lot for that kid. No, I'm not. It's all for me. Really, it's all for me. Okay. Barry: "Log, in limbo. We're taking each day moment by moment, working with raun as we did before, letting him make the decisions, or not make them; letting him know we're with him." The ceiling? Think that's pretty up there. Dr. Clark: How long has it been? Suzi: Oh, two and a half weeks. 17 days. Approximately. There's no apparent change. But, Bob, he's different. - How? - He's more aware. Maybe he's taking it all in. He knows the way. He just has to decide. Dr. Clark: You both talk as if he's a mature adult, ready to make his own way in the world. Maybe he's testing US. Maybe if we allow him to be where he is, then he'll see that we really accept him. Raunie? Some water? - "R." - "r," very good. - Kuh... - [ Sniffling ] Nance? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I just can't stand to see him that way. I'm sorry. Nancy, there's nothing to be sorry about. All we can do is help him and hope that he'll find his way back to US. When will that be? When he's ready, kitten. We'll just have to wait then, won't we? Yeah, we're just gonna have to wait. Come here, give your daddy a big hug and a kiss. Barry: Suzi with raun, trying to make contact again. The rocking, the spinning, working with him and waiting, and waiting, and waiting. - [ Raun cries ] - Oh! Mama nose. Yes, raunchie, that's my nose. - You're back. - Back! - Yes! - Yes. Oh, my son is back. You're back, you're back. Down! He said he wanted down. Well, if down's where you wanna go, down you go. Barry. Oh god. It's nice you came back, raunchie. Come on. Nance. It's all right. It's okay. It's all right. Raun: Come on, wanna race with me? Barry: Oh, come on, raunchie, I'm too swift for you. Oh, all right, okay. All right, all right, I'll even give you a head start. Wait, you start here. All right, you got a head start. All right, babes, you call it. - On your Mark... - Right. ...get set, go! I'm gonna get you, raunie! I'm coming! Oh, I'm gonna beat you, raunchie! I'm gonna win! Here I come! Aahhh! Whoa, you won! That's 10¢ I owe you. Hi, my name's raun. We're going to go to the zoo. Wanna come with US? Oh, he doesn't talk, little boy. Oh, why not? Well, he can't, because he wasn't born perfect, like you.
