(Laughing) Yeah, and I actually have them here in this folder. Hey, a few of us are gonna hang out tonight, pizza and a movie, wanna come? Oh that sounds great, but I actually have to work tonight. Oh bummer. Yeah, I'm babysitting for professor Torres. No way, really? Yeah, I've been babysitting her kiddos a few times a month. Since when? Uh, since freshman year. Oh, I wouldn't do that whole babysitting thing. Really, it's not so bad. I was always stuck babysitting my younger siblings so I realized early on, I don't like kids very much. (Laughs) Well, professor Torres' kids are really sweet. They're no trouble at all. Plus, once they go off to bed, I'm able to study. So it's a win win. Oh, here they are. Great, thanks. I'll walk you to your car. Sure, let's go.

Okay guys, go outside so Amber can come inside. Mr. Torres is picking me up. He says he's just a few minutes away. My sister will be here in the morning to take over and stay further, through the weekend. Okay. [Mrs. Torres] I left all the emergency numbers on the fridge and of course, you have mine already. Yeah. (Phone buzzes) Hi honey. Will you play hide and seek with us later? That's why I brought my flashlight for that very reason. (Mrs. Torres chattering) (Distant horn honking) Okay kids, time to say goodbye. Oh, I'm gonna miss my babies. Thank you, Amber, talk with you when we land. [Amber] Bye Mrs. Torres. - Bye! - Bye. (Door creaks) (Clatters) All right, who's ready to have some fun? [Katie] Me! Me too. Let's play some games. (Crickets chirping) (Die rattles) One, two, three, four, I win, I win!

Oh that's right. We'll play hide and seek after you go brush your teeth. Sis, I wanna go and brush my teeth first. Okay, go brush your teeth. Don't forget to floss. Are you okay, Katie? Yeah, I'm just a little sad. What's the matter? I just miss my mom and dad. It's okay to miss them, but you know what? What? You'll see them again in a couple of days. In the meantime, you get to hang out with me and tomorrow you get to hang out with your auntie. Yeah, I guess so. So try not to think about the sad part too much. Just think about all the fun we've been having. [Katie] Okay. Oh, and think of a good hiding place where Sammy and I won't be able to find you. Okay. So go brush your teeth, I'll clean up the mess we made. [Katie] Sounds good. (Crickets chirping) - One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, nine and a half, and 10, ready or not, here I come. Where are you? Coming to find you. Are you here?

Horn went, beep beep. Engine purrs, friendliest sounds you've ever heard. Little blue truck came down the road. "Beep beep," said blue to a big, green toad. Toad said, "croak," and winked an eye when little blue truck went rolling by. [Bethany] Don't forget to lock the doors. - Okay. - And keep your phone handy in case of an emergency. - I will. - Okay.

I even had to call the police to come check it out, which is why I got home so late. Did they find anything? No, nothing.

I would definitely love to make some money this summer. Trust me, I know what you mean. Yeah, I'm sure. Hey um, maybe we can hang by the pool this weekend? Yeah, uh yeah, that sounds cool. Let's do it. Cool. Anyways, it was good seeing you. Yeah, you too. I uh, gotta keep putting these books back. Oh yeah, sure, of course. Okay, bye. Bye. Hey um, I'll call you about setting up a time?

I don't know, I was hoping you knew. I've never had to deal with something like this. This is ed and Lorraine Warren kind of stuff. Yeah well they're both dead so that's not going to help us. Well maybe you can try to make contact with whatever this thing is, to see what it wants? No. Didn't you learn anything from the horror movies? You never try to communicate, it only leads to somebody getting possessed. But we can't just pretend like this isn't happening. No, of course not. Maybe grandma will know what to do? Grandma? Got any better ideas? No, I guess not. (Dramatic, suspenseful music) (Birds chirping) Thank you so much for meeting me, grandma. Aye baby, you know I'm always here to talk, except Wednesday nights after 6:00. That's bingo night. (Amber chuckles) How's your mother doing? I haven't seen much of her, since your father left. You know mom, always working hard. Yeah, that's always been your mother. Ever since I can remember, she was making her own money, always working, even when she was in school. You remind me so much of her. Unfortunately, not all men can handle strong women with Patience. Do you think that's why dad left? Your father has always been battling his demons. I don't think his leaving had anything to do with anybody, but himself. Have you heard from him? No. So angry at him, I wouldn't wanna talk to him anyway. It's okay to be angry. Just don't let that lead to bitterness sentiment, okay? So, about this thing that you were telling me about over the phone. (Upbeat, cheery music) (Water swishing) Man, that was fun. I just need to catch my breath for a second. Yeah, me too. Man, I just wish I could lay out here all day and not go into work, just work on my tan. Can't you call it off? No, I really wanna start earning as much money as I can this summer so that maybe I can afford to go abroad during the winter break. Really? Yeah, I mean, I would just love to see the world, you know, even if it's just for a week or two. That sounds exciting, definitely would put something like that on my bucket list. You should. There's a whole world outside of the valley that I've never experienced. Yeah, I hear ya. Last year I went to the east coast and I loved the winter experience there. But my favorite seasonal experience, Autumn in the midwest. It's not too cold, it's not too hot, and the leaves turn into this beautiful color. It's really an amazing sight to see. It sounds like it. Anyway, back to reality. Yeah. Wanna do a few more laps? Let's do it. All right, sounds good. (Water gurgling) (Upbeat, cheery music) (Birds chirping) (Lemonade burbling) So what do you think of all the strange things that have been happening to us? I am an old lady and I have seen a lot of strange things in my lifetime, especially here, in this region. This, this is a haunted valley. Spirits constantly roam through the roads, the streets, and the alleyways, looking for a dwelling place. What do you mean, grandma? The ancient scriptures tells us to stay alert for our great enemy, the devil. He's prowling around, like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour. The devil? And his demons. I just thought the devil is supposed to be in hell. Then you'd be wrong. Hell was created for him, sure, but he and his angels dwell amongst us and they are trying to lure as many souls to hell with them. Jesus himself dealt with demons all the time in the scriptures. He was even tempted by the devil. Well, we're all seeing some kind of human-like entity, not some kind of devil or demon. The devil can take any form he wants. Couldn't it just be the restless spirit of a woman who passed here in the area? Baby, our souls are designed to sleep when we die until awakened by god himself when the day of judgment arrives. When a demon attaches, that demonic force continues to impersonate that person long after they've passed. It wanders the streets, looking for someone else to attach itself to. How do you know if you have an attachment? Many people don't realize it. They go through an entire lifetime without ever knowing. Yet, this entity influences many choices they make. Does this mean we're gonna become possessed or something? Attachment sometimes leads to possession, but not always. If you are seeing a physical manifestation of the spirit, then it's a good sign because it means it is still prowling around. However, it is also very dangerous because it means it has targeted you, that it has targeted your family. What? You must remain vigilant. How? The enemy tries to find ways to gain access into your home and ultimately your heart, as it is this way that it can also draw you away from the love and protection of god. See, we are empty vessels. We can choose to fill our heart with bitterness, greed, hate, anger, lust, which are open invitations to unclean spirits of the world. Or, we can choose to be filled with the presence of god. The choice is ours to make. Remain vigilant. You know, I don't think I've ever taken this path home before. Yeah, it's a bit faster. You just have to pass by the old Miller house. The what? The old Miller house? You've never heard of the old Miller house? (Laughs) No. Well, it's only supposed to be one of the most haunted places in the valley. What? Yeah. Why? Well, I mean, I don't know if it's true or not, but as the legend has it, Mrs. Miller became very depressed after suffering the loss of a child. Her husband, Mr. Miller, tried to get her help. She was inconsolable. (Mrs. Miller crying) (Dramatic, ominous music) She began to hear voices that were telling her to hurt herself. (Water hissing) (Disembodied whispers) (Water hissing) (Dramatic, ominous music) (Flesh squelching) (Dramatic, ominous music) Unfortunately, her husband wasn't able to help her. She became lost in her loneliness. (Dark, eerie music) After that, Mr. Miller was never the same again. People said that he still talked to his wife. They even saw her on the property at times. Eventually he moved and no one's lived there ever again. (Birds chirping) (Dramatic, ominous music) Anyway, it's just a ghost legend. Yeah. (Dramatic, ominous music) (Cheerful, rhythmic music) (Phone ringing) What do you want? Bethany. I really wasn't expecting for you to pick up. I was just gonna leave a message. How are you doing? Just get to the point. Uh, I'm not uh, quite sure what the best way to uh, say this is, so, I'm just gonna go right ahead and say it. Um, I've met someone, Bethany, and um, we uh, we'd like to get married. Well I hope she knows what she's getting into. Yeah. So I'm just gonna go right ahead and uh, send you the uh, divorce papers. That way we can finalize this thing and uh, we can both move on with our lives. Listen, I was hoping you could do me a favor and uh, share the news with the kids for me? Let 'em know yourself. (Sighs) (Heavy machinery humming) (Dramatic, foreboding music) (Leaves rustling) (Gentle, cheery music) So um, do you believe any of that? What, the stories? Yeah. Sure, I believe miss Miller killed herself. How about the ghost part? I don't know, I'm sure there's some truth to the stories. Have you ever experienced anything paranormal before? I don't know. I can't say I have. Have you? Uh... oh my goodness, you have, haven't you? I'd rather you not think I'm some kind of nut job or something. No, I think that's so cool. I envy you. Trust me, you do not wanna experience anything paranormal. Well, maybe just a little. Well, this is where we split up. Yeah, I had a really nice time. Me too. Um, call me? Yeah, of course. Cool. I'll see you soon. - Bye. - Bye. ♪ Everything you feel ♪ (Birds chirping) (Grass rustling) (Birds chirping) (Eerie, humming music) (Rustling grass) (Woman screams) (Dark, ominous music) Maybe he's right, I don't wanna experience anything paranormal. (Distant traffic humming) (Birds chirping) So, apparently we live down the street from a haunted house. What, how do you know? My friend Mayra just told me. Apparently some lady committed suicide there after having suffered from depression. When was this? I don't know, exactly. It sounds like quite a few years ago. Mayra says people claim to have seen her on the property long after she died. That's it. What? Grandma was telling me that demonic spirits attach themselves to people when they see an opportunity. What? She was telling me that what we think are human spirits or ghosts are actually demonic spirits impersonating the person that they were attached to until they can find someone else they can attach themselves to. Okay. Don't you see? This entity is probably the same spirit that attached itself to this poor woman, due to her state of depression. Might have been what led her to commit suicide in the first place, taking advantage of her poor mental health. Now, it's trying to find someone else to attach itself to. What? So the spirit wants to attach itself to one of us? I think so. How do we stop it? I don't know, she didn't say. What? Okay okay, I probably should've asked. You think?

(Mayra laughs) (People chattering) So, I'm sorry to hear things aren't going great with your dad. Yeah, thanks. I just don't like feeling anger all the time, you know? It's exhausting. I bet. I know it's easier said than done, but you just have to forgive your dad for putting you through this. It's just so hard, you know? Well, look at it this way, just because you love and forgive someone doesn't mean you always have to agree with their choices or even like them for that matter. You just have to release someone that you've been holding captive. My dad? No, you Aaron, you need to release what you've been holding in. Be free. What do you mean? Well, while your dad made his choices and they have consequences, so do yours. So, I wouldn't let anger in. Bitterness will just eat you up inside. It'll eat you alive. Maybe you're right. Of course I am. Be the Aaron I've come to know. Which Aaron's that? The nice Aaron. The nice Aaron? Stop. Can I be bad? Stop.

Yes mom, I know. We're just trying to figure out why this thing is following us. You cannot deal with this alone. (Distant phone rings) Listen mom, I'm gonna have to let you go. I've gotta get back to work. Yeah, I know. I love you too. (Birds chirping) (Quiet music) Lord, please help my daughter and my grandchildren. Illuminate their paths and deliver them from evil. Let your spirit fill them with wisdom and power. Free them from oppression. In the name of your son, I pray. (Mutters) Prays for church, huh? Come on. [Speaker] I haven't seen you in church lately. (Laughs) Well, not much sense in my going to church. Do you remember one time when we were small, and we were out here, it was from right over there, I jumped out at you from behind the tree. Greg walked out, got all excited, he shook his fist at me, and he said, "boy, you're (Mutters) For help." (Chuckles) Remember that, right over there? We used to really be scared. [Speaker] Johnny. [Johnny] You're still afraid. [Speaker] Stop it now, I mean it! Oh mom, I didn't hear you come in. Must have dosed off while watching the TV. Is Amber back as well? She mentioned going out with some friends. [Speaker] Stop it, you're acting like a child! (Phone ringing) (Deep, ominous music) (Phone ringing) Hello? I should be home in about 20 minutes or so. Is your sister home from the Torres' yet? Mom? I'm headed home now. Shouldn't be long. (Dark, menacing music) Aaron. Aaron? (Dark, menacing music) (Bethany gasps) (Dramatic, jarring music) (Dark, menacing music) (Ghost crackling) You leave us alone! (Door clatters) Leave my family alone! Stop following us. You can't have us. You can't have my children! (Dark, menacing music) (Door clatters) (Engine hums) That thing, grandma, it's taunting us all the time, and I'm sick of being scared. I know this is difficult, but there is only one way to be set free from the grips of demonic oppression. Christ told his disciples that sometimes malignant spirits can be fought with prayer and fasting. So I have been praying and fasting for you and your family. Now is the time for us to fight. (Engine humming) (Quiet, eerie music) (Keys clink) (Door clatters) (Quiet, eerie music) (Rustling grass) (Quiet, eerie music) (Quiet, shuffling footsteps) (Quiet, eerie music) What are you doing? I'm anointing this house. What's that? It's an old biblical practice used to consecrate something or someone to Christ. Consecrate? To set apart. It's not some kind of mystical thing that I'm doing here. (Quiet, eerie music) Lord, I anoint this house so that no ungodly spirit may enter. (Disembodied whispering) (Quiet, eerie music) That your angels stand guard on each side of the property and all of its corners. (Disembodied whispering) (Quiet, eerie music) In the name of your son, I pray. (Disembodied whispering) (Quiet, eerie music) Now it's time to anoint you. What? Lord, I anoint Aaron as a vessel to be used solely for you. Protect him from the evil one and all his demons. Fill him with your love and compassion, your kindness, your mercy, your grace. Peace and forgiveness. Now, repeat after me. I renounce evil. (Lights buzz) I renounce evil. I renounce hate. (Dark, ominous music) I renounce hate. I renounce bitterness. (Lights buzzing) I renounce bitterness. I renounce sin. (Dark, ominous music) I renounce sin. I renounce the devil. (Lights buzzing) I renounce the devil. (Dramatic, jarring music) (Disembodied whispers) (Dark, menacing music) (Door slams) (Dark, menacing music) (Baby crying) (Dark, menacing music) (Debris clattering) (Baby crying) [Disembodied voice] Please help me. Please help me, help. (Baby crying) (Dark, menacing music) (Dark, menacing music) (Door clatters) (Engine hums) Are you all right? Yeah, I think so. That is good, (speaks Spanish) (Knocking at the door) (Dark, menacing music) (Door clatters) Bethany. - Mom. - Come in, (speaks Spanish) Come in. (Dark, foreboding music) You know what, mom, I think I'm just gonna head home. I've had a rough day. Nonsense, I'll make you some tea. No mom, I'm just gonna head home. I just came to pick up Aaron. How'd you know I was here, mom? Hey uh, GPS tracking app on your phone. Let's go. (Fly buzzing) Come on, you're letting the flies in, come on. The flies are coming in. (Bethany sighs) (Dark, foreboding music) Come on. You okay, mom? Yeah, I'm all right, I just, I don't know what came over me, I started feeling so strange. (Door clatters) Come on, mom, take a seat, you don't look so good. [Grandmother] Yeah, he's right. I don't know what's happening to me, I just, oh, I feel faint. I'll get you some water. I think, I think that entity is trying to take over you. What? I saw it again, mom, but this time it took your appearance. Wait, wait what? I thought it was you, it was in the house and I thought it was you. You know what? I saw it too, on my way over here. What? I have never felt so afraid in my life. I just... [grandmother] Here you go, sweetie. Thank you, mom. Grandma, bring the oil. What? I think what she's experiencing is a spiritual attack. (Dark, foreboding music) Oh. Wait, oil, what oil? You'll see. (Dark, foreboding music) That spirit cannot get a hold of you if you surrender yourself to god. You must lay your sorrows by his feet. (Bethany growling) Look to god, let go of that resentment... - die, die! - You've been holding on to. Don't let it eat you... (Bethany screams) Don't let it consume you. (Engine humming) (Quiet, menacing music) (Door clatters) (Bethany growling) Let go of... (Bethany growling) Let go of that resentment that you've been holding on to. Don't let it eat you alive. Don't let it consume you... no! (Grandmother continues) (Bethany growling) It cannot get a hold of you if you surrender yourself to god. Lay your sorrows at his feet, (speaks Spanish) That spirit of sadness.
