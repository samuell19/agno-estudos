Well that's how it came. How it came? Was it delivered? Alright. Your know what Dad... It....its really just a dumb thing I did.

Oh man that is some mixed up shit you talkin' Is it? All right, so I'm not all sugar and spice if that's what you mean. But it ain't like I'm walkin' around all day thinkin' about how I can chop up my mom and pops. Oh you see right there. See what? I didn't say chop up. I asked if you're ever angry enough to kill 'em right and I said no I don't wanna chop 'em up and. So you must have been thinking pretty specifically about it 'cause I didn't ever say it.
