A thousand years ago, Princess Jingjue created a cruel punishment to subjugate her people. Anyone who tried to oppose her or approach her would be cursed with this Mark on their shoulders. In the end, they would die in terror. And what's even crueler, the curse is passed from one generation to the next. So, over the next thousand years, everyone who is cursed has been looking for two things. The dragon bone celestial Tome and the Mu Chen Orb. According to the legend, when these two items are combined into one, the curse will be lifted. The second half of the dragon bone celestial Tome describes how to find the Mu Chen Orb. Under the vault of heaven. South to the iridescent clouds. A peak where dragons hide. A mountain where snakes coil. A crystal path to a hidden place. The tomb with a water cave. Under the vault of heaven. South to the iridescent clouds. It means Yunnan. A peak where dragons hide. A mountain where snakes coil. Those are referring to specific locations. A crystal path to a hidden place, the spring where all life returns. It's better for you to confirm these scenery descriptions when you get to Yunnan. Where are gold tooth and fatty? Both of them? They are trying to hawk antiques. Everyone, please be quiet! Listen to me! We definitely have the dragon bone celestial Tome. That's right. It's just not convenient for us to show it to you today. Got it? Why isn't it convenient? Am I right? - That's right! - That's right! Son of a bitch! If you don't show us the dragon bone celestial Tome, I'll kick up a stink. Believe it or not? Try it and see. Fuck you! Fuck! I'll kill you! Who? Make way! Hey, fatty! - Fuck you! - Who dares to move? Nobody moves! Stop! Mr. zhou is here! Who? Mr. zhou. Mr. zhou. Mr. zhou. Dad. - Fatty. - Yes? Gold tooth. Yes? Show them your backs. This Mark is called the ghost eye curse. It's like a cancer. Anyone who gets it... Won't live past 40. A couple of youngsters who initially had nothing to do with it. But they wanted to help a friend to lift the pain of the curse. So, they gathered their courage and went to the dragon Ridge. While they were there, they faced hundreds of human-faced spiders and thousands of red-eye wolves. Kill them! Kill! Besides the two of them, hu Bayi was with them too. Professor. Shirley Yang. Including my daughter, linglong. None was spared. So, do you understand it now? The value of dragon bone celestial Tome doesn't lie in the trade itself. It's for saving lives. There are eight sentences in total. I've only translated the first five. The last three sentences need to be solved by a master. Besides you, I can't think of anyone else. Maybe, there's someone who can help us. Shirley. I have good news. Mr. zhou found someone. His name is Chen yulou. Everyone calls him blind Chen. Thirty years ago, he led a group of men into the tomb of emperor Xian in Yunnan. We don't know why, but only blind Chen made it back. He was blinded in both eyes and became insane. Since then, he was sent to the mental hospital. Baby, you're so beautiful. Mommy loves you so much. The most eye-catching to mum Stay still. This is Chen Yulou. You're here. Is he really blind? Yes. Hello, sir. I've heard a lot about you. We are friends of Mr. zhou. We came to visit you today to... No need to be so formal. Hello... Young lady. Your heartbeat feels smooth. You're dutiful and measured. You must be... A descendant of the banshan sect. Young man. Excellent. You're very virile. Connected to heaven and earth. I like your personality. But if I'm not wrong, you must be a descendant of the legendary mojin. You're right. I'm sorry. These two gentlemen, please get out. Today... I only want to speak with the girl. Young lady, I like touching your hands. I hope you don't mind. What is the meaning of, south of the iridescent clouds. A peak where dragons hide? You know it. What about, a crystal path to a hidden place? Do you have a boyfriend? That guy who was just here, he's nice. The two of you seem to be kindred spirits. But because of your personalities, you haven't made love. Such a shame! Sir, please stay on track. I am. What does the spring where all life returns mean? That guy makes you feel overwhelmed by emotions. And he makes you feel like you're floating in the air. I'm asking you a question. That feeling will spread to every inch of your body. Only then, your life will finally have meaning. How do I find the Mu Chen Orb? You'll never find the Mu Chen Orb! Because you'll never be able to cross that mountain! Which mountain? You're just a human. Humans just see a mountain. But the mountain is the same as us. It's alive. A human life lasts for only 80 years. But the mountain lives 100,000 years. Sleep takes 2,000 years. It takes 800 years just to turn over. How can normal people like us see through the changes of the world? No matter what, we must find the Mu Chen Orb. That's enough. I'm tired. I need to rest. But before you go, I have to tell you one thing. Please do. You should make love to that guy soon. Then, your life will be more interesting. That's the last thing that I wanted to tell you. Young lady. When you're overwhelmed by emotions and full of desire... You'll know I mean well. You bravely sought out the Mu Chen Orb once too. But now you're here, hiding in the mental hospital because you're scared and hopeless. You're afraid of the orb, aren't you? No matter what... We'll find it. Even if we die in the flames, or turn blind like you, we'll stop at nothing. Do you want to see my eyes? Look! Never look into its eyes. Never look into its eyes. Let me see. Go another ten kilometers from here, it should be the hidden dragon mountain. - Linglong, take a picture of us. - All right. Look at me. One, two, three. Go away. Is everyone all right? What happened? Just half a meter away. This is the ancient kingdom's worm witchcraft. It uses the corpses of people and animals to feed the insects. That's disgusting! There's a very strong magnetic field here. We must be close to the tomb of emperor Xian. Bayi. Caiyun. What is this? I spent a few years in Yunnan when I was in the army. I got to know caiyun. You were so young then. Bayi. Have some tea. All right. - Here. Have some tea. - Thank you. I grew it myself. Have a taste. Please help yourselves. Caiyun. Are there any waterways that go through hidden dragon mountain? Only a hidden path nearby which has been deserted for a long time. Do you know the way? Kongque can lead you there. But it's very dangerous in hidden dragon mountain. You must be careful. Don't worry. Bayi! You lied to me. It took you so long to come back. Kongque, don't be rude. You need to be their guide tomorrow. Don't get lost. No problem. Let me introduce everyone. This is kongque, caiyun's daughter. - She is my... - Bayi! The little tree we planted has grown up. Let me show you! Come on. The little tree we planted has grown up. Let me show you! Who's there? It's me, Bayi. What is it? I brought you some mosquito repellent. There are so many mosquitoes here. Put some on. You'll sleep better. Thank you. Actually... Hurry up, fatty! W ait for me! - It's so beautiful! - Slow down, linglong! Slow down! Hi! Ongque! Hi! Linglong, let me catch one for you. Can you? My goodness. Professor, come check this out! Be careful! It isn't a firefly. It's a flamefly. Whoever touches it, whether a human or an animal, will immediately burn to death. What is it? This is the flamefly king. The leader of all the flameflies. No matter when, as soon as the they smell the king, they will come to him immediately. Fatty, look! Flameflies have no eyes, just the sense of smell. If the bottle is closed, they won't know where the king is. Shirley. If one day, the king burns to death, all flameflies will come to his side and burn with him. They're even more loyal than dogs. Here. Linglong, over there. Thank you! W ait for me! Faster, fatty! Slow down. Wait for me, linglong! Fatty, let's go that way. It's so beautiful! Shirley! Fatty, you try it! Slow down. Wait for me! Fatty! Fatty! - Give it to me! - What are you doing? It's my turn! Here. Incredible. So amazing! Where are you going? In the snake coil mountain, a god of a thousand feet tall, protecting the king's crown. My lover enters the mountain to drive out the demon. I accompany my lover to the river's edge. He never looked back since we parted ways. It's difficult to meet again. I want to make my lover a pair of shoes so that he can walk a thousand miles. The raindrops are warm. The moonbeams are cold. But I will never again see... My lover's white shirt. Under the mountain where snakes coil I keep watch for my lover's return. The river water is babbling like the years flowing by. Cheer Bayi on! Kiss! Bayi, that way. Harder! These bamboo rafts have been around for several years. I don't know if they can still float. No worries. They just need to be tightened up. Bayi. Come back safely. Don't worry. Quickly go back. Remember! There's poisonous gas in the canyon at night. You need to find the highest place you can to spend the night. I've heard that deep in the canyon there's an island floating high in the air. If you're lucky enough to find it that will be the safest place to spend the night. Got it. You talk more than your mother. I couldn't bear to leave the hotel. Those flameflies were so fun. I can't believe you stole that! I didn't steal it. I'm just borrowing it for a few days. I'll return it to her when we get back to the hotel. Besides, I did it to make you happy. Give it to me. Give it to me! Listen, I'll keep it for now. When you want to play with it I'll give it to you. Hey, do these bright stones worth a lot? They aren't stones but light moss. A type of fluorescent micro-lizard that lives in the river bottom. Professor, the magnetic field is really strong. We couldn't determine the direction. Just keep going straight. Little fish. Little fish. Be careful! That's a blade-toothed viperfish. A type of man-eating fish. They will become violent when they smell blood. - Are you all right? - I'm fine. - Everyone, be careful. - You be careful! Duck! Linglong! Fatty! - Fatty! - Fatty! Hurry! Hurry! Are you stupid? Why are there so many of them? Bayi, quickly think of a way! Professor! Gold tooth! Bayi, we're almost out of oil! Linglong, give me the bomb! Fatty! Everyone, get down! Hold on tight! Linglong, hold on tight! Come on, gold tooth! Where are we flushed to? Don't be afraid, linglong. Slow down. Are those three going to be all right? I think they'll be all right. We need to find them soon. I think these were the workers who built the tomb of emperor Xian. They were going to use the chains to escape but they couldn't escape emperor Xian's treachery. Isn't this the guidong language? It seems like emperor Xian was a disciple of Princess jingjue. The builders begged for their lives but entered the abyss instead. It's not working. Get ready to fire the signal! If they've left the cave they would be able to see it. Run! Linglong! Linglong - fatty. Run! Quickly get up! Bayi! Fire the signal gun! Shirley miss! Bayi! Where are they? Shirley, go and find the professor! Hurry! Professor! - Bayi! - Professor. - Are you all right? - I'm fine. Is it a lizard? I've never seen it before. I know it has a strong sense of hearing but it can't see anything past three meters. You scared the shit out of me! Where the hell did you go? Cut it out. - Are you all right? - I'm fine. Run! Jump! Linglong, come. I'm so sorry! Quickly, move. They're afraid of the sound of thunder. Follow me. Bayi! - Gold tooth! - Look over there. The floating island is real! Let's go! How do we get across? We'll use the sound of thunder to get past the lizards. Professor, what should we do? The average speed of sound is 340 meters per second. Based on the height of the clouds and the estimated distance and humidity of the air, there will be about three to seven seconds between the lightning and the sound of thunder. And the sound of thunder lasts about 5 to 12 seconds. = = = m= or = =o = or ci = ae Ty tatret seis ce ir tes ses ste a te la se sss tt a le te tas sets = ee seiarsrerrees er sr I ans ar esr rr ee er ie nnr ss oresexgs eere ee rrs rears arne e Teri sers es aas iasnses = professor, this is a life-threatening situation! Can't you be more exact? What is the exact figure? All right. Don't cause more trouble. How long before sunset? Another 40 minutes. Start the countdown timer. After 40 minutes, poisonous gas will fill the canyon. It's the only chance we have. The visual range of the lizards is only three meters. We'll be safe if we keep quiet. Get ready when you see the lightning. Run when you hear the sound of thunder. We must reach cover before the thunder stops. Remember. We're not up against the poisonous gas or the lizards but time. Run! Hurry. Hurry. Shirley, follow me! Quickly leave! Cut the crap! Run away! Shirley, I'm leaving it to you. Shirley! Be careful. Hurry! Quickly run! Get on the floating island! Hurry! Quickly run! Quickly run! Run! Shirley, hurry! Bayi! Quickly leave. - Shirley, hurry! - Hurry! Hurry! Shirley! Hurry! Bayi, hurry up! Bayi! Bayi! - Bayi, hurry up! - Hurry! Hurry! Bayi! Hurry! Hurry! Bayi, hurry up! Bayi! Bayi! Wow, it's so beautiful! Nice view, right? What's the deal with the island? The magnetic rocks in the canyon create a circular magnetic field. This mountain is a huge magnet itself. Amazing! The temperature drops at sunset which causes the water in the clouds to turn into rain. So, this island has appeared. Guys! This is the floating island that kongque told us about. All four seasons happen in a day. In the morning, the spring breeze blows. At midday, the summer heat rises. At sunset, you get the crisp Autumn air. At midnight, it freezes and snows. We should come here for our honeymoon next time. Get lost. My friends hail from all corners of the country disobey the god climb a mountain of swords and plunge into a sea of flames hardships and dangers bring it on! You can't extinguish our heroic spirit inside demons and ghosts bring it on! You are just a dish that goes with wine never be parted my friends walk our dogs together when we get old never be parted my friends hold our hands for generations Hu, it's been a crazy day. Let's go and swim. It's so tiring. Do you actually want to swim or just to look at the pretty girls? Hu, let me tell you. - Don't come with us then. - Don't come. - Let's go. - Let's go. Professor, we're waiting for you. It's pricking me. This place is amazing. If 1 could live longer, it would be even better. Why did you say that? Look. Fatty truly loves linglong. And linglong is gradually accepting fatty. It seems so casual between you and Shirley. But the truth is you treasure each other a lot. You have your tongue in your cheek. As for me... I really don't wish to go on anymore. Why not? Every step ahead is dangerous. We could die any second. It's fine for old guys like me and gold tooth. But you're still young. You should Cherish your life. I do Cherish it. That's why I want to live longer. I must try my best to go on to get our rightful lives back. But it's just a hope. Hope is hope. It doesn't matter if there is no chance or there's a hundred percent chance. Bayi. Bayi! Come here! Professor, come and join us! - Professor, come on! - Come on! - Hurry! - Bayi! It's so comfortable. I'm coming! Come on, Bayi! Come on, professor! Professor. Cheer up. I believe that we'll have good luck tomorrow. Come on, Bayi! I hope so. It's so cold. It will be winter after midnight. Hurry. Let's get out. It's so beautiful! A sea of flowers. It stretches for dozens of kilometers. How do we get down? Just slide down the cane. What kind of flowers are these? Fatty, look! They're transparent. Don't touch them. Why? These are called skull flowers. They are transparent when they blossom. The color fades off when they dry up. Mr. liu. Mr. zhou. I'm going to meet someone. Run! This is the deathless crab of the hua clan. It can't feel pain because its nervous system is detached from its body. The lake water heals it. No matter how bad it's hurt, if it returns to the lake, it will heal instantly. Any ideas? Let me think. Stay in a five-star shape! Draw its attention. Spread out! Its belly is its weakness. Attack it! Gold tooth! I'll handle it! Fatty! Now, Bayi! Bayi! Fatty! Run! Linglong. Linglong, are you all right? Linglong. I'm fine. Quickly go and help them. W ait for me. Gold tooth! Take this. Don't let it get back to the lake! Bayi! - Bayi! - Bayi! Harder! Linglong! Linglong! - Linglong! - Linglong! - Linglong! - Linglong! Linglong, wake up! Linglong! Wake up, linglong! Linglong! Wake up, linglong! Are you all right? Linglong. Since I was little... I've always wanted to marry... A good-looking, tall man. But after going through this I discovered that... A fat guy who can tell jokes is not that bad too. Although he's not handsome, he always dotes on me. It's a shame... I won't live to see that day. That won't happen. Fatty. If there's another lifetime, continue to come after me. All right? Linglong! - Linglong! - Linglong! Linglong! Linglong! Linglong! Linglong. Beifu city mental hospital Mr. chen. How are you doing lately? How are they? Let me tell you the meaning of the seventh line. Those who submit will survive. Give up and you will live. Can they make it back? Are they willing to come back? The water circulates. This coffin... Will take her back to the opening of the cave. Perhaps, she's not the only one. I've decrypted the seventh line. Those who submit will survive. Give up and you will live. It means we should go back? We've made it this far. But we're at the end of our rope. One more step forward and we'll fall into the abyss. Human beings can't defeat a god. Go back. Those coffins are the last chance that the gods have given us. If we go back, will the curse be lifted? Our parents raised us. All of us have families. We have brothers and sisters. Why don't we go back to have a drink with our family and have a good rest? That's right. We have a short lifespan. But in this world, nobody can escape death. At least, we could enjoy the years we have left. Take linglong for an instance. If she had gone back sooner, she could at least have gotten married. I'm the one who led all of you here. Let's take a vote. Whoever wants to quit... Can leave now. I quit. Birds can't fly over oceans. It's not because they lack courage. It's because there's no more waiting on the other side. Everyone. I want to take linglong home. Why don't we just go back? Instead of dying a graveless death, at least back at home, we could have a grand funeral. I don't know why I want to keep going forward. The only thing I know is that... If 1 quit today, I'll still come back someday. For no reason, all of us have this curse on us. It's like a virus. It's also a disaster. But why can't we reject it? I just want to meet the person who created the curse. I want to talk to her. Ask her to remove it. That's all. He's right. Our parents raised us. So, we should have the right to live freely and the courage to protect our own lives. I understand. If I continue., I could die at any second. But I would rather it end like this. I want the woman who cursed us to see that there is finally someone on this earth who dares to stand up to her! Everyone. Throughout this quest, we have become like blood brothers. L, hu Bayi, can die without regrets knowing I have friends like you. Tell blind Chen when you get back. There's nothing special with this hidden dragon mountain. Fuck the hidden dragon mountain. Bayi! Take care, everyone. I've changed my mind. I want to enter the mountain with my lover. Hold on. Hu. I don't believe what you said. But I can't help it. I've trusted you since I was a child. Professor. Everything you've said makes sense. But for uncultured people like us, we don't always believe in what makes sense. We believe in our brothers. Take care of yourself. All I wanted was for everyone to live longer. But in the end, I'm all by myself. I won't go with you. I'll wait for you at the cave entrance. We are friends after all. I won't just sit here and watch all of you become lost souls. I'll be at the cave entrance... To take your bodies back home. Get lost! The bone ladder leads to the golden palace. Wind shakes the immortal tower of the mysterious ninth heaven. The wonder of the sky palace is more than anyone could imagine. But actually, it's an entrance to hell! Cross the three centuries bridge which symbolizes emperor Xian's three centuries of suffering. Then, open the gate of immortality. The moment one touches the Mu Chen Orb, it's the beginning of eternal damnation. Hu, hurry! Don't ever touch it! Humans just see a mountain. But the mountain is the same as us. It's alive. Human life lasts only 80 years. But the mountain... Lives 100,000 years. Sleep... Takes 2,000 years. It takes 800 years... Just to turn over. How can normal people like us see through the changes of the world? Run! Don't look into its eyes. Don't look into its eyes! Don't look into its eyes. Now, they only have one way left. Those who submit will survive. Those who submit will survive. Those who submit will survive. Those who submit will survive. Those who submit will survive. I will not submit! We're only humans. But in all our lives, we only kneel to our parents. You're so ugly. And you have a bad breath. - Fatty! - Fatty! Where's the bottle of flamefly? It's over there! If one day, the king burns to death, all flameflies will come to its side and burn with it. They're even more loyal than dogs. A million ants can swallow an elephant. Bayi! Professor! Professor! Professor! Professor, drop it! It will burn you! If I'm not going to hell, then who will go there? - Professor! - Professor! Snake king! I'm coming! - Professor! - Professor! Professor! Professor! Professor! Let's go. Fatty, let's go! Bayi, let's go! Let's go! Let's go! - Let's go! - Let's go! Hurry! In the snake coil mountain a god of a thousand feet tall protecting the king's crown my lover enters the mountain to drive out the demon I accompany my lover to the river's edge don't look back don't forget me I want to make my lover a pair of shoes so that he can walk a thousand miles Zhou linglong sun xuewu professor. Linglong. Rest in peace. Guys. Let's set out tomorrow morning.
