Hello? Good morning! Just a second. Who is it? Hello? Hi, Virgil! Yes. What do you want? You called to ask me if I drank last night? Ah yes, the talk show... Listen, who else is coming? OK. Anything else? All right, honk and I'll come out. Bye. Rodica! Where's the dictionary? What dictionary? -Of Mythology! -In the bookcase. -Where in the bookcase? -With the dictionaries. And where are the dictionaries? On the bottom shelf, up top. Where? -Did you find it? -No. Look behind the bearded guy. Which one? Aristotle or Plato? Hold on... There it is! Why don't you keep it up top? Here! Your suit's ready. Your socks and underwear are out. I'm ironing your shirt. And, before I forget... -Liliana called. -She wants money? No, she wanted to say good luck with the show. Thanks. I found these papers in your suit pocket. -Do you need them? -Ah yes, well done. Mr. Vasilache, it's Mr. Jderescu. I need to know if you'll make it to the show, as promised. I can be reached at home at 32-16-66, or at my office at 32-17-47. I repeat, 32-17-47. 50% off Tutova wine at Racova Supermarket. The Tutova Vineyards... Bunch of drunks! Come on! Today we celebrate the 16th anniversary of our revolution that... Let's go back in time to December 22nd 1989. This afternoon, our show "Issue of the Day", will feature a debate on the events of December 1989, events which changed the course of our lives. Our star presenter Virgil Jderescu, will talk to two guests who witnessed the events. Watch "Issue of the Day" at 3 p.m. to find out more... Find out what? Damn TV... Hooligans! Bunch of thugs! What's that ugly thing? That's what I thought when I saw you with it last night. Did I bring it in? -Don't you remember? -No. You even sang the national anthem. That wasn't me... Right, Manescu, you sang Beethoven's 5th Symphony... Was I loud? Enough to wake half the neighbourhood. Listen... You bring your wages straight home to me today. I won't be scrimping at Christmas. I'll bring it to you, don't worry. If you don't give me all of it, every last cent... -Is this coat okay? -Don't change the subject. I know how much you make. You sure do... You know better than me! -What was that? -I'll bring it to you... -Or you won't be let in. -I have the key. And I'll tell Ana you drink all day long. I'll bring it, I swear to God. But don't tell Ana... What should I wear? Your black suit. Black and white? I don't want to look like Laurel and Hardy. Wear whatever you want, just bring me the money. I have to change the flowerpots. Hello, is this the Grigoriu residence? Can I speak to Mr. Grigoriu? Virgil Jderescu here, from the TV station. Do you know where I can reach him? Could you ask him to call me back? I invited him on my talk show, and I'd like to know if he's coming. Thank you, goodbye. Stop eating your bread plain. Mr. Vasilache, it's Virgil again. You have to let me know if you're coming to my show or not. You were supposed to call by 9 a.m., it's 9:30. Call me back, please. Asshole! They'll call back. Everybody wants to be on television. -Did I mention Liliana called? -Yes. She needs another 500 lei... For what? To go to Sinaia for New Year's. I gave her money for that last week. Yes, but now she wants to buy skis. Tell her to go sledding. Enough of the high life! All her colleagues have them... You won't get me again with your firecrackers. -Come on in! -Good morning, old man Piscoci. -Come in, Petrica. -We're in a hurry. Come in. Don't stand outside, people talk... Good morning. -Come in, come in! -Come on, Petrica. -Stay here, we're in a hurry. -Sit down. I really can't. I have a favour to ask you. Can you be Santa Claus this Saturday? He doesn't understand. My brother-in-law broke his leg playing football yesterday, I remembered you used to do Santa. -Ten years ago. -Do you have the costume? It was eaten by moths. -I have one, but it needs adjusting. -Bring it. I'll be back in half an hour, OK? I have nothing else to do. Petrica, hurry up. Look at what old man Piscoci has for you. Let's go! I'm bringing Rico his lunch and I'll be back. -What did you cook for him? -Soup and meatballs... -Have a quince fruit! -Thank you. Let's go Petrica, we're in a hurry. Don't forget your bell, and sing some Christmas carols. Let me know how much I owe you. I don't want any money. How much do I owe? For last night, or the total? The total. Let me see... That's for Alecu... Cornel, Sofronea... Manescu. 192 plus 48 times 2... 6, then for last night... 326 lei. That much? Let me see. You spent 100 lei last night. It wasn't champagne, for Christ's sake! No vodka, but you bought everybody drinks. Hand me the broom. Gigi, I told you to stop serving me when I'm drunk. I tried, but it was impossible. All right... Here's how we'll do it... Give me a bottle now, I'll get my pay from school, and be back. Manescu, I'm not serving you anymore. Come on, Gigi. I have a talk show later. I'm nervous. What's the show about? -The revolution. -What revolution? You're not going to start in now too, Gigi... You'll drive me crazy. Want a cigarette? I should've failed you way back when. OK, we can do it that way. I'll give you the bottle... But if I don't have my money tonight, I'll be knocking at your door. -Did I insult the Chinese guy again? -Yes. -A lot? -No, the usual. What an idiot! You owe me 340 lei. I don't like this girl at all. She exaggerates too much. -Couldn't you find another one? -Wait... Grigoriu residence? You recognize me? Well where is he? Tell him to keep his promise next time, for Christ's sake! Tell him he's an imbecile, and he can piss off with his political remarks. -Virgil... -I sent him packing! -Look at this picture I found. -What picture? It's Liliana, at Christmas. Look how plumpish she was! How old was she then, four... -And who's he? -That's you. No, the other guy... That's Santa Claus. -Who was it? -I can't remember. Look how happy she was! Will you hand me that jacket? Here. -I have no more money. -500, dear... -Will you stop? -Yes. Bring me the phone book. -It's red! -Red? If this is red, I'll kill myself. Then what is it, old man Piscoci? -It's got stains all over! -Where? There, everywhere. It looks like a dirty dishcloth. And this? If you say this is white, I'll kill myself again. What can we do? If we had the money, we could buy another one. -Do you have a sack? -What for? What do you mean? For the presents! -You can carry them. -In my arms? -In your arms. -Yes... Speaking. Hello, Mr. Virgil! What a surprise! Yes, I know, I watch your show often. Yeah, I was there. So what? Why not? But how can I be of help? All right. I'll be there. I'll be waiting for you at a quarter to two. Next to the milk factory. At a quarter to two then. Why do you have to honk? Very well, I'll be there. Merry Christmas! -Here. -In conclusion: this costume is shit! Teacher's here! Good afternoon! This is a big group for a re-sit. So, you all failed the Ottoman Empire exam? What am I supposed to do, if you can't even cheat properly! You haven't fixed this chair yet... Everybody, get out a piece of paper and write. I don't even know what subject to give you. And it's Christmas... -What do you know? -The French Revolution. -What? -The French Revolution! -Do you all agree? -Yes! OK, start writing... "The French Revolution." Move over! Strange. Why are you all thinking about the French Revolution? Move over! Hi there! You have a class today? They're doing a re-sit, they were all failed. Why don't you just make up some marks? -I'm trying to scare them. -What for? All they think about is lighting firecrackers! What do you want? What can I do? I want you to pay me back my money. -What money? -Manescu... The 200 lei? 270, plus the 70 from last month. -Have we been paid yet? -You kidding? You know we're paid before 9 a.m. I'll finish up with them and be right down. Hurry up, I'm going to the countryside. We'll meet downstairs in half an hour. 15 minutes. Don't keep me waiting. The French Revolution... Give me break! Fucking elevator! -When are we seeing cartoons? -Tomorrow! What the hell are you doing? Get outta here! Go to hell! What's going on? Damn kids, punish them once and for all! Bunch of hooligans! What the hell are you doing? Hear the rhythm, feel its sway It keeps calling me your way Dance to the dream, the heavenly steam Latino music is my life... Stop it! Professor, what is that? A Latino tune. Play a Romanian tune! It's Christmas! -What are you doing? -I'm filming. -Holding the camera? -It's the new thing! Put it on the tripod, before I whop you with it! -And what are you doing? -I broke... I broke... -What? -My instrument. Broke his instrument... Hurry up, show starts at 3. What are we playing? "The Deleni Ring Dance", OK guys? We should play something fun... You'll do as I say. We have no choice, he broke his instrument. You don't have an instrument, so sit down. -Can we begin? -Yes. Places everyone! 5, 4, 3, 2, 1... Don't you have anything else? You've seen everything. Really? Well, it's better than this old rag. -How much? -40 lei. -That's expensive! -I'm the cheapest. I know you're the cheapest. But it's still too expensive for what it is, it won't last two years. Look at this, it's already fraying! Look at it! It's fraying, look! If you pull at it, of course it frays! Wait till the kids pull at it! 10... 20... 40. 40 lei. Perfect. -Shall I wrap it? -No, I'll keep it on. To get used to it. It looks good, in any case. Hello! Do you have firecrackers? -How much for a box? -2 lei. What's bothering you, Fanica? Leave me alone, I'm in a hurry. -Where will you be for New Year's? -At home. -I'll be in Dubai.. -Ah, Dubai.... I'm going to Busteni with friends. -What about you Mr. Principal? -What do you care? He's coming with me to Dubai. -May I? -Of course. 270. -270. -Thanks. -You owe me 130! -Yes, madam. Manescu! 60. Hello, Vasilache? I'm calling to say fuck your answering machine. Goodbye! -Son of a bitch! -I don't get it. What's all the fuss about the revolution? No one could care less anymore. What do you want me to do? Programmes on inflation? Or films about gypsy music? I'm going to my sister's, in Bucharest, for New Year's. What? You'll be with your wife, right? What about my show on New Year's Eve? I leave the 30th, in the evening. -You can't. -Why not? Who'll do the interviews for the evening news? The boys. What do you mean "the boys"? I'll edit the Christmas show, with the interviews, as usual. Costel can read the news, it won't hurt him. And at midnight? What, at midnight? Who's going to film? Well it won't be me. Who does the interviews? Costel. You won't hear a thing, anyway, with the firecrackers going off. -You're not leaving. -Yes, I am. If you leave, you're fired. Go ahead. Vali, I'm not kidding you. Neither am I. I'm going to Bucharest for New Year's and that's that! Vali! New Year's in Bucharest is crap. And it's ugly. Even when it snows, it's muddy. And it's so crowded... You won't like it. You'll be back. -200? -Yup. Where? Wherever you want, if there are no radars. -Hey, old man Piscoci! -Hello, Eugen. Christmas is three days away. What am I getting into? Does it have music? Yeah, I changed the condensers, the radio... Even the headlights adjust for curves. -Eugen! -What? Gimme a light. Come on, give him a light. -Give it back to me. -Right away. Start it with the remote. It's got heated seats... Heated seats? Cool. It's not bad. It's got chrome rims. In the winter, I use these ones. -The winter ones. -Yup! What're you doing? What's up with him? It's my money I put down. -What are you doing, old man Piscoci? -Who, me? It was them. I didn't do it, it was them. I told you he's crazy... Life is too short. I'm sorry about yesterday, really. At the bar... I'm really sorry. What do you want? -I came to apologize. -Apology accepted. Listen, Chen... I'm listening. I wanted to ask you... You need money? Yeah. It's the last time, I promise you. I just paid up all my debts, and I don't have a penny. Last time. I don't know what else to do, you're my only friend. And when you drink, I'm not your friend? When I drink, I don't remember what I say. I'll tell you what you say. "I should just go back to my country, "I'm worse than the gypsies, I'm little and mean, and that I'm yellow inside." "Yellow inside"? I don't even know what that means. Me neither, but that's what you said. If you don't help me, my wife will kick me out. How much do you want? 600. How much? 600, please. I'll give it back beginning of January... I don't have that kind of money. The whole town buys your firecrackers and you don't have 600 lei? Promise to stop saying that shit? I promise. Do you give me your word? Yes. Word of honour. OK. 100, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400... It might snow in January. What's happened to the seasons? Before, at Christmas, the snow so high we couldn't leave the house. That's true... Do you know how long I've known you? How long? Since primary school. You used to be Santa Claus. -They called me Father Frost. -Yeah, Father Frost... What school did you go to? Number 3. How did you know it was me? One year, you gave me a teddy bear, instead of a toy gun. When my mum saw that, she followed you out to tell you off. I followed her, and saw you getting changed. What year was that? '65 or '66... It's been ages... -I was so mad! -Why? -I cursed you. -Why? You never gave me the toy gun. I got stuck with the teddy bear. Everyone makes mistakes. To err is human. I'm sorry to say it, but your car stinks of gas. -It's the diesel. -Diesel? It's an old thing, but it runs well. It doesn't let the rain in... -Or snow. -Or snow. Hello, madam. Professor? -How are you? -Hello, Tibi! -Got a tree? -For the house. -When did you get back? -Last night. -When do you leave? -In 2 days. -It's been a long time. -I don't come home often. Stop by and visit me. I'll try. Try! Here they are. I must go. Happy holidays! -Come visit me. -I'll try. Don't try, come! Do you still play the guitar? Do you still play? No, it's been a long time. What's going on, old man Piscoci? Just stretching my legs. What a nice tree! Come on, let's go! How much time till the show? About an hour, let's go! Can we buy a tree at the market? It's easier with a car. Come on, let's go! Good idea. Are you sitting in the front? -No, why? -Are you on the show too? -Yeah, you? -Yeah. Take off your hat. When we're on the air, don't look at the monitors, talk nonsense, or use bad language... You know we're not like that, for Christ's sake! I've had to deal with so many morons on my show... You think people will watch? No one gives a shit. You'd be surprised. I get good ratings. Especially in winter. -Piscoci! What's going on? -My hat! Come here, we're starting! -Where do I put my hat? -Fuck your hat! Fucking hat! -What are you doing? -I'm nervous. You always do that! You want me to be mute? -Give me some too... -Cut it out! This is my first time on TV. I thought I could count on you, old man Piscoci. -Boss! -What now? -The nose signal still on? -Yes. What nose signal? If an idiot calls, I scratch and he cuts the line. -How do you scratch it? -Normally. -What if you really need to? -Never happens. -What if it did? -I'd control myself. All this stuff must cost a bundle in electricity. -Yeah. -How much per month? 1000, 100... I've no idea. We're starting boss. -Positions... -1000, that's huge. Where do I look? Into the camera! Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Today is a very important day for our country. Sixteen years ago, in December 1989, the revolution broke out in Bucharest. A new era dawned in Romanian history. Let's go back in time, in order to examine whether we, the citizens of this town, took part in this moment in history. Together with our guests, and phone-in viewers... Dial: 32-17-47. I repeat: 32-17-47. We will try to answer a question... that's been on my mind for a long time. The question I would like... to clarify today is: Was there a revolution or not in our town? Allow me to introduce our guests, Professor Tiberiu Manescu... Hello. And Mr. Emil Piscoci. Emanoil. -Emanoil Piscoci. -Hello. Many of you will probably wonder... why take on a topic like this, after such a long time? Well, I think that... as in Plato's "Myth of the Cave", when people mistook a fire for the sun, it is my duty as a journalist to ask if we haven't left one cave for another, bigger cave, and if we, in turn, are not mistaking, a straw fire for the sun. I believe there is no present without the past and no future without the present. The clearer the past, the clearer the future will be. On the other hand, Heraclitus said, you can't step into the same river twice. But let's try to go back in time, to 16 years ago, for the sake of truth and a better future. Mr. Manescu, in your opinion, was there or wasn't there a revolution in our town? Hello. Firstly, Mr. Jderescu, I'd like to thank you for giving us this opportunity to share out thoughts, on the dramatic events of December 22nd 1989. Was there a revolution, yes or no? I'd like to add that as time goes by, people forget and it's a shame. A great shame. I absolutely agree. From December 17th we knew, along with the rest of the country, that what was happening in Timisoara spelled the end of the communist nightmare. All it took was one spark to light the fire, and wake us from the bad dream haunting our country. That spark came from the capital, Bucharest. Yes, from Bucharest. But do you believe there was a revolution here too? -Certainly. -Mr. Piscoci, what do you think? I agree with Manescu, there was a revolution. Mr. Manescu, can you tell us... what you did on December 22nd 1989? Yes, of course. The night before, I was with some colleagues listening to Free Europe's coverage of Timisoara. We felt it was time to put an end to the communist nightmare, so we decided to go protest in the town square. Sorry to interrupt. Which colleagues? I was with Mr. Bastina, the Math teacher. -Who died, if I'm not mistaken. -He did. And the Romanian teacher, Mr. Vlad Petrescu. An extraordinary man. And poet in his time. Also dead. God rest their souls! -And Professor Haidu. -The chemistry teacher... Who emigrated to Canada with his son. Together we decided to protest in the town square. Weren't you afraid? Of course we were afraid. But we felt we had to do something. You went to town square? Where were you before? At school. -You spent the night there? -No. We went to collect our wages, then we went to the town square. But you said you spent the night together. No. After the radio show we all went home. The next morning, we collected our wages, and went to the square. Do you remember what the time was? They pay us at 10. We had to wait a little, 10:30... The time to get to the town square... At 11:30, we were in the square. -So, 11:30. -Yes. What did you do in the square? First of all, the square was completely empty. There wasn't a soul. Everything seemed frozen, like in the picture behind us. But with my colleagues, we started to protest. And what did you shout? What everybody else was shouting: "Communism is dead", "Down with Ceausescu" "Down with the dictator", "Timisoara, Timisoara"... "Olé! Olé! Ceausescu's gone!" Then what happened? Nothing really... I remember, at one point, we... threw rocks at the Central Committee windows. No one came out of the town hall? No. Not a single soul. Unbelievable. Then what? Keep going... We tried to break in through the main doors, but of course, they were locked, so we went around back, but it was locked too. When we came back, the Securitate agents were there. How did you know they were Securitate agents? I recognized one of them. Wait... who was it? -Is that relevant? -Very relevant. A certain Bejan, who worked for the Securitate. How did you know that? Everybody knew. His son, Sorinel, was at our school. I saw him at Parent-Teacher meetings. He has a farm "Bejan and Sons". -A firm. -Firm, farm... Let's recap. There were 3 of you. No, 4 of us. There were 3 of them. And only 2 of you? -No. -Sorry, 2 of them! There were 4 of us, 3 of them. Did you know the other 2? -No. -Were you there, too? No, I arrived later. So? So what? -What did you do then? -When they threatened us? There was a dispute. Did you fight? That's not the issue, but yes we fought. Who won? We did. When people saw what was happening, they forgot their fears, and came out into the streets. They came from all over: from the factories, downtown, the hotel... From that side, you see? From the park... In ten minutes the square was full. "Olé! Olé! Ceausescu's gone!" that's where we shouted. That's where we cried "Liberty!" for the first time and the agents ran off... Just a moment, do we have a caller? Hello, Mr. Jderescu. Who's calling? Maricica. I live across from town hall where Mr. Manescu says he was in '89. -Maricica who? -Maricica Dima. Mrs. Maricica, over to you! I want people to know that this Manescu and the others, God rest their souls... were drinking like pigs. They spent the entire night in the corner bar. They're drunks. The whole town knows it. Some revolutionaries! From the 21st to the 22nd they did nothing but drink. So stop playing the hero, for Christ's sake! Mrs. Maricica, mind your language. Excuse me, I lost my temper... -Anything you'd like to add? -No. Goodbye. What do you have to say to that? What do you want me to say? Is what Mrs. Dima said true? What do you mean? This bar where you were drinking all night... It's not true. We drank on the 22nd, but on not the 21st. We were celebrating. Do we have another caller? A serious caller this time, I hope. Hello. Who's on the line? -Vasile Rebegea. -Hello, Mr. Vasile. Hello! And congratulations on the excellent idea of having this show. It's good to clarify this business of the revolution in our town. Thank you. How can you help us? At the time, I was working as a guard at our town hall. All right, and? Early on the 22nd, I was at my post in the sentry box, which isn't there anymore. Please continue! It was right by the stairs, like in the picture behind you. By the elderly gentleman. -Near you, Manescu. -No, right there. My name is Piscoci! Now I remember. It was right there! I was in the square and I didn't see anyone, like Manescu says. People started coming around 12:30 p.m. Then they came in droves, from all over, it was chaos. You say you didn't see the four teachers in the square? Nor heard talk of them. You were in the sentry box all morning? I was away just for a moment, but I was there all day. You left your post? For half an hour, to run an errand. Give me that. It's mine. What time was that? I don't know. 10:00, 10:30. I don't know. Maybe 11. Could you be more precise? I couldn't say exactly. Let's say 11 o'clock. What did you buy at the market? Who cares? -I'm trying to calculate... -What for? To know how long it took you. Fuck your calculation! -Mr. Vasile! -I'm sorry. Why did you go to the market? To buy a tree, like all Christians. -Of course. -Did you walk? No, I took a helicopter! Mr. Vasile... Of course I walked. 15 minutes there, 10 to buy the tree, 15 minutes back... You were gone for at least 40 minutes. So what? Did you come back with the tree? What fucking business is it of yours? How can you say I wasn't there, neither were you! I was there. You were buying a tree. But I came back. When? A week later? Did you bring the tree home or did you bring it back with you? Mr. Virgil, it doesn't matter! When the crowd came, I was there. I saw Ceausescu get in the helicopter on my TV in the sentry box, people started coming en masse five minutes later. But before the chicken flew the coop, there was nobody. When we were in your sentry box, you weren't there! Chased by the Securitate? He's lying! Four people can't fit in there! When you're getting beaten, believe me, you fit. The Securitate hit you? -No, they kissed us.. -He's lying! -You're the one who's lying! -OK, hold it! You took refuge in the sentry box. -We locked ourselves in. -At what time? -I don't know, around noon. -Around noon. Mr. Vasile says he was in the sentry box at 12:08 p.m., when Ceausescu flew off. -There was nobody there. -Not a soul! What did you do in this space of ten minutes? I don't know if it was exactly noon. We hid in the sentry box. They hit us and left. We stayed there. -Did you protest? -Of course. -You're a dirty liar! -You're the liar! Gentlemen, please. Gentlemen, what? This dirty liar better just piss off and leave us in peace. There was no revolution. It was better under Ceausescu. Go fuck yourself with your revolution! What can I... Stupid Communist! Mr. Vasile has raised a major issue that can be of help to us. Did people start coming before Ceausescu's departure or after? His departure is very significant because it spells the end of communism. The Central Committee is to our revolution what the Bastille is to the French. So, if people took to the streets after 12:08 p.m., then there wasn't a revolution in our town. What do you think? I still maintain that we were in the square before 12:08! OK, but everyone contests your claims. -You're calling me a liar? -No, but... if we are to believe our viewers, there are some grey areas. Which ones? Mr. Vasile, for example, never saw you. I'll tell you how it happened, OK? Wait a minute, Piscoci. His sentry box was there, right? And where were you? I don't know, by the statue. Weren't you in front of the statue? Yeah. So? If his box was there and you were in front of the statue, he couldn't have seen you. Look... Let's say Mr. Jderescu is the statue. Can you see me? Of course not! Don't you understand he was at the market! Not in his box! We have a call. Incredible. Who's calling? Costica Bejan speaking. Hello, Mr. Bejan! How can you talk about our dear revolution, with this idiotic individual? A little respect, Mr. Bejan. You're one to talk about respect, Mr. Jderescu! You the one who invited a drunk who soils the reputations of respectable people? Tell me Bejan, where were you on December 22nd 1989? It's Mister Bejan to you. We'll have a chance to discuss this face to face, some other place. -Is that a threat? -Mr. Jderescu, are you still there? Yes. With all due respect, if you say my name one more time, I'll sue you. Where were you on the 22nd? I'm going to sue you and you'll pay through the nose! I won't let anybody soil my name and reputation. I have 3 prospering factories... -Tell us what you were doing... -Shut up... -Mr. Jderescu, may I continue? -By all means. I have three factories and 154 employees, I've been working hard since '89, and I won't let anybody make a laughing stock of me. Under no circumstances, Mr. Bejan. We're just trying to piece together certain fundamental events. So, what were you doing on December 22nd? Mr. Jderescu, please control your guest. Gentlemen, please try to understand... That's why I called. According to Mr. Manescu, on December 22nd 1989, you threatened him in the square. Not true! On December 22nd I was in my home town, near Buzau. I was looking after my sick mother. And when you hit me, you were in Buzau? This isn't a drunken tale. I have witnesses. -Don't you always! -One minute! You weren't in town that day, Mr. Bejan? That's right! OK. Where were you working in '89? All right, Mr. Jderescu, I'll tell you. I worked for the Securitate. As an accountant. Accounting is a respectable profession, regardless of the political system. It's true he was the accountant. Accountant or not, he worked for the Securitate. Yes, because I graduated top of my class. Congratulations! I was very good at what I did and I'm not ashamed to admit it. But to say I was in the town square that day, would be libel and punishable by law. Mr. Bejan, you maintain you weren't in the square on December 22nd. Mr. Jderescu, I won't waste time repeating myself. One last thing however... If you say my name one more time without proof, you'll be very sorry. Try to show a little more professionalism. And stop telling all these tall tales! Goodbye! Goodbye! These Securitate guys. Mr. Manescu, stop accusing Mr. Bejan without proof. You're afraid he'll sue you, right? Not at all, as a good journalist, I know not to accuse someone without proof. Journalist? Aren't you a textile engineer? No. Weren't you in the textile industry? That was a long time ago. Now I'm in journalism and... That's it! Journalism... One was an accountant for the Securitate and now he owns factories, the other was a textile engineer, who now owns a TV station... I should've become an astronaut. Stop being so ironic. Why did you bring me here anyway? I beg your pardon. If you two have things to straighten out, I can go. It seems our discussion has reached a rather sensitive point. It's time for a summary of our debate thus far. So far, the presence of Mr. Manescu, in the square the morning of December 22nd 1989, has not been confirmed by any of our viewers. Nobody knows whether he and his colleagues were present before the crowds at 12:08. Where was I then? On the Moon? Without proof, we cannot confirm your presence in the square. -Is it important? -It's very important! If people started gathering after Ceausescu fled, it means there was no revolution here. -What was it then? -I have no idea, but... Allow me to explain. The revolution started in Timisoara, right? Then it spread across the country, all the way out to our town in the middle of nowhere. -Yes, so what? -So what? Look. Do you know how they turn the streetlights off and on? Have you ever noticed? I don't see the connection. That's how the revolution started. First Timisoara, then Bucharest, then little by little the whole country. What's the connection? The revolution, is like the streetlights: They light up in the centre first, then they spread all over town. Piscoci, you're full of nonsense sometimes. Nonsense? How is electricity linked? In one way. People here are cowards, they're scared. They stormed the square when Ceausescu left Bucharest. -Is that what you did? -Yes. When I saw things had exploded in Bucharest, I went out too. Mr. Manescu claims he went out before. I was there after. Is it a revolution if people took to the streets after the fact? One makes whatever revolution one can, each in their own way. I think we'll have a commercial break now. Then we'll answer the question of the day: Was there, or was there not, a revolution in our town? Let's go to commercial now. Commercial break! How dare you call me a textile engineer on the air, on my show? How dare you say I wasn't there? Do you have any idea how hard it is to set up a TV station? And you come here and talk shit! -What are you doing? -Going to the men's room. We're back on in 5 minutes. -Where is it? -Down the hall, on your right. -Now what? -I'm leaving. -You can't just up! -You keep saying I'm a liar, I'm out! I didn't say you were a liar, I just repeated what the others said! If you leave now, it's obvious you're lying! Boss? Are we finishing the show or... Who taught you to film like that? If you move the camera again, I'll throw it in your face! The tripods don't work! "The tripods don't work?" You come here, I teach you everything, and then you all go to Bucharest! What a bunch of morons. 5...4...3...2...1... Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Heraclitus said you can't step in the same river twice, but let us jump back to 16 years ago, because we love the truth, it's healthy. The theme of our show today is: Was there a revolution in our town or not? You can call in at: 32-17-47. I repeat: 32-17-47. I'm here with Mr. Emanoil Piscoci Hello. A shot of our guests now would be perfect. Thank you. On my right Mr. Emanoil Piscoci, On my left, Professor Tiberiu Manescu, Good afternoon. We have a call. As they say, "Vox populi, vox dei!" Let's get to business. -Good afternoon! -Gelu Isarescu speaking. -Hi Gelu, how are you? -Good evening, it's dark already. Why are you calling? To talk about the revolution, Mr. Jderescu. I'm listening. Mr. Jderescu, I've worked in sales my whole life, I'm a respectable man. I know both you and Mr. Manescu. I've known old man Piscoci since he was doing Santa for the kids. Hi, Gelu! Go on. As I said, I know all of you and Mr. Bejan too. I have no reason to lie to you. I think there was no revolution in our town. Mr. Gelu, have you been watching the show? No, why? We're we disconnected? What a pity. Do we have another caller? Good evening. Hello. My name is Ion Costachescu. We're listening, Mr. Costachescu. Mr. Jderescu, this is how it happened. On December 22nd 1989, I was driving back from the countryside. It's pig slaughter season. As I was leaving my native village, Munteni de Jos, I saw my back tire was almost flat, but I told myself it would hold for 7 km. But it didn't. Because the trunk full with the pig, the wine, the Christmas tree... Go on, we're listening. To cut it short, I made it as far as the town square. -What time was it? -12:03 p.m. -Exactly? -Exactly, I remember well. I saw the clock in the square. Did you see anybody at that time? There was nobody there. I must have been there half an hour before people started arriving. The guard was right, they all came at the same time. The square was full in 10 minutes. You didn't see Mr. Manescu and the others in the square? No, there was nobody there. I'd left my jack at home, so there'd be more room in the trunk. I see... Once in a while, I'd see someone walk by, but they were all in a hurry... What did you do then? -About the flat tire? -Yes. I had a colleague who lived close by, he lent me his jack. So you left the square? No, I didn't leave. His windows overlook the street, so I called up. How could I leave my car with a full trunk! I see. Thank you. Anything else? That's all. If it's of any help... -Thank you. -No, thank you. Happy Holidays. Happy Holidays. Happy Holidays! Mr. Manescu, for the last time, were you in the town square on December 22nd 1989, yes or no? I was. But everyone says you weren't. -I'm telling you I was there. -Mr. Manescu. One, two, three, four television viewers say they didn't see you there. The first lady didn't say I wasn't there, she said I was in the bar. -The other three... -The Securitate agent? Let's not say his name again. Of course he denies it, he wasn't there! What about Vasile Rebegea? We don't even know if he came back from the market. And Costachescu? Gentlemen, who gives a fuck about all those idiots! God forgive my foul language at this holy time. That town clock has been slow ever since they put it up. Why split hairs over such stupidity? Is there still a cameraman on this show? A close-up, for once. Thank you. Do we have a caller? Good evening, who's calling? Chen Xiao Chuan. -The Chinese guy? -Yeah, that's me. Don't tell me you joined the revolution. I didn't join your revolution, I was on Egypt at the time. -Where? -On Egypt. In Egypt. All right, why are you calling? Because I know Mr. Manescu very well. He is not a liar. You can count on him. -That's why you called? -Yes. And I'd like to add that Mr. Manescu is the kindest man I know in this town. Like everyone, he has his faults, but that's no reason for people to have a go at him, just because he drinks. Chen, I don't think the Romanian revolution is any of your business. But would you mind telling me why you're selling the kids firecrackers? Supply and demand. Anything to add? No. I've said what I have to say about Mr. Manescu. I didn't ask you to repeat yourself. -No. -Goodbye. Goodbye, but it's a shame you drag someone as honest and intelligent as Mr. Manescu through the mud. Are you giving us a sermon? No, but I don't like the way you Romanians treat each other. If you don't like it, go back to China and leave us alone. You come here, sell your knick-knacks, take our money, and now you're cocky? I'm not being cocky, I say what I see. He's ashamed of nothing! I can see I'm talking to myself here, goodbye. He hung up on me! I don't believe it! -No, he said goodbye. -He hung up! Were you in the square the morning of December 22nd 1989, yes or no? I was. Everyone says you weren't there. I'm saying I was there. Then they're all lying? Who cares what people say, I was there. Before 12:08? Before. And you carried on protesting? Yes, we did. Is there a caller? Mr. Manescu. You were there... before 12? Yes. Were you? Congratulations! Mr. Piscoci, what did you do on December 22nd? From the beginning, or after my arrival in the square? Start with the beginning... I woke up in the morning at 7. No, sorry, back then I was still getting up at 6:30. I shaved... And... For the boss. Go on... Anyway, I quarrelled with my wife. I was crazy back then! I went to work, but I didn't feel like staying. I was sorry I'd fought with Maria. I had overreacted a bit. I was always too jealous, even at 60 years of age, I was jealous. Sometimes, I have this feeling, that it's what killed her. I asked permission to leave early. I wanted to buy her flowers. There was nobody at the market, actually, everywhere I went was deserted. But I couldn't go home empty handed, I felt ashamed. Thank God, I had the idea to pass by the botanical gardens. I broke a window pane and stole three splendid magnolias. Then I returned home. Maria was doing the housework. I gave her the flowers, but she didn't say anything. She kept on working. I glanced in the mirror, and I saw she was smiling. I liked her smile. That made me happy. It meant she liked the flowers. But she wanted me to know she was still angry, I wanted to show her that it was all the same to me. So, I turned on the TV. At that hour, we often got "Laurel and Hardy" or "Tom and Jerry". Am I boring you? No, continue. I always liked the Laurel and Hardy and Tom and Jerry shows. But at that moment, Ceaucescu appeared, making a speech. He promised he would give us all 100 lei. I told Maria that with the 100 lei from Ceausescu, we would go for a holiday by the sea, in Mangalia, but she said she couldn't trust me or Ceausescu... And the transmission suddenly stopped. We carried on planning... we thought that if we went to Mangalia, we could still keep enough money to visit the monument at Adamclisi... She asked me to promise that, I gave her my word. The transmission resumed and all kinds of people appeared on the screen, saying the revolution had been won. Maria burst out with joy, but... I regretted the 100 lei Ceausescu had promised. Mr. Piscoci... so you went out after you saw it on TV? -I'm boring you, right? -No. Yes. I went to the square to show Maria that I could be a hero. That I wasn't afraid of the Communists. You went out after 12:08. I went out after 12:08. Our show is coming to an end... Do we have another phone call? My name is Tina, my son died on December 23rd, in Otopeni, Bucharest. We're very sorry, madam. But we want to know what happened in our town. I'm not about to reproach you, Mr. Jderescu. I'm just calling to let you know it's snowing outside. -It's snowing? -Yes. It's snowing. Big white flakes. Enjoy it now, tomorrow it will be mud... Merry Christmas everybody! Merry Christmas. Our show has come to an end. Anything else you'd like to add? Dear viewers, thank you for watching. Goodbye. -Shall I bring you home? -No. -I'll walk. -Me too. Boss, it's from Vali. I should've let the old man make his paper boats, and the other choke on his paper shreds. But I stepped in front of the camera like a fool... From now on, I won't budge from behind the camera. I'll watch them elbow each other to be in the frame. Come on, man... I'm freezing to death. The old man was wrong, they all turn on at once since they invented photo-electric cells. You messing with me? Anyone else would've already broken you in two! Well done, boy. It's calm... and beautiful. Like my memory of the revolution. It was calm and beautiful.
