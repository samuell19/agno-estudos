THE GUEST subs transleted from Bulgarian version Careful, it hurts so much. - Don't move. Did you find it? - No. Have you found it yet? - I told you not to move, Chiara. Here it is. - Be careful. What's up? Is it torn? - No, but it's half empty. God, Guido! - It's not my fault, Chiara. We will not look for whose fault it is. What are we going to do? What should we do? We need to take a pill. Will we go home, or will we go straight to Lucia? What if we don't go to Lucia's? - They're already prepared. We'll call and say I don't feel well. Dario will introduce us to his girlfriend. - He has introduced us to thousands of girlfriends. Honey, are you angry? - A little. Are we sure about that? - In what sense? Is it mandatory to drink it? Maybe it is a sign of destiny. The torn condom? - Signs are signs ... What do you mean? We've had thousands of conversations, and then you change your mind. I'm not changing it, I'm saying that ... - Do you want a child? No, that is ... Maybe. - What does "maybe" mean? One speaks in theory, but in practice it becomes different. Yes, but we've already talked about that. I know. Want to watch a little TV? A little animation? Come here. The monkey movie? Roberta, how long have you been in Rome? - For 2 months. And how did you meet? - At an exhibition. Not true: on Tinder. I'm trying to look for romance, you kill it like that. Guido, how's the book going? - I keep going. A little slower. Are you writing a novel? No, an essay on Calvino. - I like Calvino. My parents insisted on medicine, but I wanted to study philology. They did well. - No, why not? Because yes, trust me. Let's not start with the complaints. You didn't say you wanted me to take your Pearl Jam tickets. Yes, take it, we will come. - But in a month I will give birth. Okay, we'll be organized. - Enough ... Guido, Chiara? - I didn't, you took me 3 times. Eventually I will go alone. Roberta, aren't you going? - No, these things make me sad. This type of student gathering ... - "Pearl Jam" has not been separated. Grunge bands get up, when you're 20, I'm 35. Anyway. - I'm going to get the format. I'll help you. - I'll handle it. Would you like some tea? - Yes, thank you. From chamomile or from fennel? - From chamomile. Have you seen my yoga pants? Which ones? - Black with a purple edge. I thought I put them in the laundry, but I think I left them at your parents. When? On Sunday, when I took a shower with them after yoga. Come on, it's ready. - I'm coming. I'll check tomorrow because I have to go get the sauces. Are we getting sauces again? Didn't we decide your parents to stop sending us food? Honey, only two jars. - But that annoys me. As if we can't take care of ourselves. You know what my mother is. - Yes, I know what she is. Why do you say that? That's enough, Guido. - What? She started to buy you pants from the market again. She likes to give me presents. When we make love, I imagine your mother choosing them. Honey, are you angry because of the pill? - Yes. Because I didn't tell you anything. - What? Rebecca told me that she could get me a job. In Canada? - Yes, but calm down, I refused. Why didn't you tell me right away? - I didn't want to worry you unnecessarily. And what is the job? - Educational activity in the museum. They offered me a lot of money. - It must be fucking special. I, with 2 master's degrees, I am a tour guide here, and she is the director there. It is not an important museum. - But she is still a director. Is this related to the pill? Yes, because when we went to the pharmacy, I said to myself: "One moment is enough, and goodbye to all plans." What plans? We haven't decided to move. No, but we decided, before we had a child, we want to feel we accomplished something. One can realize that when one has a child, right? It seems to me that we are moving away. - In what sense? Enough, Guido, do you not see what kind of life we lead? We can't afford a trip, we go around with this wrecked car, we don't even have the money to buy a new sofa. I'll take the car to the service tomorrow, but what is this conversation about? It is financially difficult, but the work inspires us. Does your work inspire you? - Yes, why? That fool treats you like a postman. Why are you speaking like that? You've wanted to publish this essay for 2 years. Chiara, is there another man? - Are you crazy? Everything seems disgusting to you - the pants, the sauces, the work, the couch. Nothing disgusts me. - But? But nothing, Guido. Come on, good night. - How so "good night"? We're having an important conversation. - We'll talk tomorrow. Tomorrow morning I have 3 groups and 1 tour that I have not done yet. Okay, I'm going to sleep elsewhere. - Why? I'll be a class tomorrow, I have to work. I like the couch. You're the one who wants to change it. "And so I found that my feelings to him, whom I believed, I have suffocated and almost extinguished, they became bitter, bitter, and almost terrifying again. " Okay, why is this discovery so important? Someone? How does Arturo feel about his father? Sadness. - No, why sadness? No... Sympathy. - That's right, sympathy. Arturo feels sympathy for his father for the first time. To this man who prefers the unreality of staging in the face of the complexity of reality. What does it reach To maturity. - That's right. Compassion becomes a tool that understands the other in depth. It grows through that. We continue. "A hateful shadow. It's been 2 more months ..." Are you sure there is no one else? - I asked her, she denied. Do you want to check her out? Do you have the password for her email? Why me? - To find out if there is another. Behind all these conversations is a banal reality. Do you think I'll go to her mail? I'm just worried at the thought. Are you and Roberta okay? - Yes ... No? - No, just ... I think I like another one. - Then why did you introduce us to her? Because we had to see each other, to talk, and we slept together. I didn't want to leave her alone on Sunday. She doesn't know many people here. Why, what's the difference, if you break up with her on Monday? She will be distracted at work. Look, that's right. I'll see you one of these days and talk to her for good. And who is the other one? - You don't know her, her name is Tanya. She is divorced and has a daughter. Daughter? - Yes, this is a big step. But we are almost 40 years old What more to wait for? Start a family with Roberta. - Not with Roberta! But why? - Because we met at Tinder. This saddens me. She only wanted to find a man. And what were you doing there? - I'm not judging her. But to fall in love, I don't need magic. How did you meet Tanya? - In the supermarket. Dario, get well. - Of course. These? Hello. - Hello. Stupid! Are these okay? - Yes. I took 7 pairs. - Okay. Shall we eat together? - No, I'm going to work. I took the car to a service station. - All right. Thanks. What's up? - Nothing, I'm a little nervous. Is that because of yesterday? Yes, but not only ... Because of a set of things. I feel confused. Confused for both of us? - And for that. Guido? I'm sorry. Sorry, I've been asking many questions since yesterday. What? - I don't know. Have you ever wondered if we are happy or just calm? No, but what does that mean? - That we no longer have enthusiasm. Didn't we make love yesterday? What does this have to do with anything? We did it because we wanted to. Why do you want to pass on your own problems to me? So the problems are just mine? - Yes. And this bag? Alessia leaves in a few days and asks me to stay with Max. Who is Max? - How who? The dog! How could I know? So you're leaving? No, I just need to stay alone and think. I was waiting for you to tell you. - With a packed suitcase? It's not ready, I just took it out. Can we talk later, without taking offense? What else do I have to do? - Try to understand me. You're packing and you want me to understand you? I will leave. Don't act like a child. I asked you only for a little space. And I give it to you. I have to go now. Shall we talk calmly then? No, damn it. - Then do what you want. So do you need to go home tonight? - I don't think so. She didn't even call me. I'll turn on the phone to find out. And what to do with the sauce? - Who cares about the sauce? And the fact that you're giving us food ... - Is it my fault now? You break the nerves of the whole family. Yes, because I'm the typical Italian mother, right? No, Mom, you're a big Swede. And you asked me to make your grandmother's sauce for you. Dad, write bigger, she trusts nothing. What a nuisance, you do it. And I keep telling her: "Joyeta, look after your work." Because you know a lot, you've been silent for an hour! When I speak, we think of the superficial. Well done, you're pretending to be a victim now. Better to lose one like her than to find her. Women of this age should create security, not problems. You can't make comparisons, this is another generation. They throw things away, We fix them. Apparently, in your quest to fix it, Fill the house with garbage. Can I borrow your car tomorrow? - Yes, but be careful not to damage it. Won't you go swimming tomorrow? - No, I'm getting tired. Well done, keep it up. Shee buys books and doesn't read them, she signs up for swimming and doesn't go, and there is no money to waste! Okay, I'll go to bed. Mom, do you happen to have a sleeping pill? Yes, there are some drops in the bathroom. I'll sleep on the couch, you go to sleep in your room. No, there is no need. Yes, just so you don't sleep with me, you'll even go to the couch. Hello? Chiara, is that you? Hello? Chiara, answer! Dad, what are you doing? This hand tingles from time to time. Are you still awake? - I can't sleep. 3 p.m. I can't sleep, what can I do? - Good night. Who's calling? - I don't know, they didn't answer. Okay, it must be a mistake, shut up. And close your mother's door. Do you hear her snoring? Good night. She asked for space, give it to her. - What space? Don't do something you don't understand. You had your moments. When? - In Paris. Paris was something completely different. Why is it different, sorry? Because you're a man? No, because the moment was different. Were you serious about this with the child? - Yes, why? Having a baby is a wonderful thing, but it's very complicated I didn't think you ... You make children and I don't. Which "you"? - All of you. Good day. How are you? - More or less ... What's happening? The bank did not give us money for the congress we are organizing. So, suddenly? The management changed and the sponsorship was blocked. And it won't take place? - It will take place, but only for one day - this way we save on hotels. Then we'll come up with something about catering. And will we bring our lunch in a box? - Don't pretend to be witty. I thought each of us could cook something. At this point, I can't even cook for my family. Grow up! Other women have also become pregnant and it seems the world is not over because of that. For me it is no option ... I can go buy something, but I don't have time to cook. I'm sorry, but I have to go to pick up my son from kindergarten. All right, go to the garden. - All right. God, I'm sorry. Will you call me later? I'll call you and tell you. - All right. Goodbye, sorry. - Goodbye. Already with he first child she freaked out. What will she do with the second? Grandparents are far away. Yesterday I was given the green light for a 2-year research fellowship and I was told that I would be the chairman of the commission. In your opinion, between you and Mrs. Kreshi who should I focus on? Madam Professor, I do not know what to say in this situation. There is nothing to say, I have already made my choice. But I'm not comfortable with that. - There's work to be done here. Who are the other members of the commission? - Perone and Chiminieri. They will come to Congress we have to perform well. Isn't Chiminieri very strict? - Stay calmi, I'm the chairman ... Are you cooking, or are you one of those men who can't do anything? No, I'm cooking. - What could you cook? Parmesan with eggplant? - Well done, good idea. Make 2 trays, and everything is fine. I can't give the lecture tomorrow. Replace me as usual. With pleasure. The education of young boys was entrusted to male teachers, because they thought that women were not capable of teaching. However, Maria managed to raise her son Cosimo alone and as a ruler, he became famous with his abilities in politics and his sense of art. Will you go to the next room? I'll be back soon. I have to tell you something. - What happened? They have awarded the scientific scholarship and they want to give it to me. I am glad. You see, things are moving. - Yes. Let's go out to eat tonight - we'll celebrate and talk. I am very busy. Then I have a private tour of Villa Torlonia, then I have a group here, and then I'll go to Alesia's house to pick up Max. We'll take him after dinner. - He'll be alone all day. I'll wait. - Okay, I'll try. I'll call you when I'm done. - All right, bye. Now we will do as in "Roman vacation". We will ride a motorcycle on the streets of Rome. - This one? Yes, this one. - All right. Have you never ridden a motorcycle? - No, never with a girl. Maybe it's small, I don't know. Damn it! Is this a private tour? - What, are you following me? Can't I follow you? - He's just a customer! Are you fucking with this one? - What? Is everything okay? - Yes, please wait for me inside. Will you explain to me what's going on? - Nothing. How so "nothing"? Who is this? Nobody, Guido. Will you stop this paranoia? What's wrong with you? - I'm sick. Calm down, breathe. How can I be calm? Guido! You will see, you will sleep well. Do you think I overdid it? - Did you overdo it? You were too good, I was going to hit him. Who, excuse me? - That fool. The warrior of the night arrived. For these things I become a beast. This is her. Hello, mom? No, I'm not going home. No, I'm with Pietro and Lucia. I came home once you called me all the time. Yes, I'll get you the car. Okay, bye. Calm down, there's nothing between them. I think he's just trying. Do you think so? - Yes, Chiara is not that type of woman. What does "not this type of woman" mean? - It's just said. Are we still types of women? - No ... I want to know what kind of woman I am, for example. You, darling, are a mother. You're beautiful. - Fuck! You're a terrible whore! Is it better? - Quieter, Jacopo sleeps. Did you prepare the clothes for tomorrow for kindergarten? I am going right now. You'll take him to the park tomorrow, because I promised him. I'll just take him tomorrow, that's all. I've been asking you for a week. - The Koreans are in the company. Tomorrow I'll go get it, don't worry. No, I always go anyway, I just asked you once ... Sorry, I don't feel much ... I'm tired, I'm going to bed. Sorry, Guido. Good night. Do you need anything? - Yes, a T-shirt. I'll get it for you. - Thanks. Will you tell me what are you going to do tomorrow morning? Besides everything else, I work too, don't make me angry. You're always angry. - What are you talking about? You don't even realize You're constantly correcting me - the t-shirt is too small, the socks are not suitable, the pot is not washed ... I'm sorry. Good morning. - Good morning. Do you want coffee? - Yes, thank you. Shall I bring it to you? - No, I will come. Do you want me to take Jacopo today? - Don't worry, I'll go. I was thinking about the convention - \ If you go shopping, we can cook something here together. - From now on? At least we'll take advantage, because I think ... I can handle that. - Yes, but that's how I feel guilty. If we do it together, I think I can help. Anikini told me that the scholarship announcement would be published. Okay. - And she wants to give it to me. I told her it wasn't right that we worked together. Don't worry, I'm glad for you. - Submit documents, we'll share it. It's not who knows what. - I know, but I feel guilty. Don't worry, I have bigger problems during this period. With pregnancy? - No, that's not it. Is anyone sick? - No. Because you're arguing with Pietro? - That's not it. And what's up? What's wrong? I think that... ... I'm in love. In what sense? In another man? - Yes. With whom? Corso. Is that the 'Corso' Corso? It's probably been 10 years. - Seven. Okay, seven, but you're married, you're a mother, you're pregnant. Do you think I don't know? What should I do? How so "what to do"? Isn't he in Chile? - He's back. I can not explain it to you... As if time has not passed, the feeling is so ... Maybe it's because you're pregnant ... - And my hormones are crazy? No, maybe it's because of nostalgia, that you're wrong ... No. - No? You shouldn't tell me things like that. In what sense? - You don't have to, because I'm worried. Are you worried? - Yes. Are you worried? - You're all crazy. Excuse me, but what do you mean with "everyone"? - All of you - you, Dario, Chiara. You make and break relationships with ease, think only of yourself. Thank you very much. I'm telling you something no one knows, I'm in pain you can't even imagine, and you're judging me. Well sorry. But the baby is from Pietro, isn't it? - Of course it's from Pietro. I didn't do anything with Corso. Then what are you doing? - We're talking, that's all. And what are you going to do? - I don't know. For now, I live like this - for the moment. In a month you will give birth, and live for the moment? Look, I'm thinking of telling everything to Pietro, but then I tell myself, that he wouldn't understand me. I don't understand, let alone him. Now is not the time to separate, you will tell him after the birth. It's not a movie to pause. - But you have to give up something. Is this a whim to you? - No, it's not. I didn't say that, sorry. I'm sorry. When I think of happy people, I think of the two of you. I think you're wrong. Guido Botay, born in Florence on July 5, 1980 No, Rome, 2 Adriatico Blvd. Mom went to the market, then she will come to pick you up at the park. Okay. - Got it? Yes. - What do you eat today? Pasta with cucumbers, pasta with sauce and pasta with fish. Have you eaten all this pasta? - Yes. And a tangerine, a kiwi, an apple and a banana. Hi, how did it go? - Okay, everything is fine. With you? Better. It's stupid, but only after talking for half an hour, and I calm down. Listen, I have give your phone number to Corso. - Why? Because he's afraid that he will call me, when I give birth, and since only you know about it, I thought that ... Do you mind? - Look, a little ... Is there a problem if ... I will feel uncomfortable in front of Pietro. Because you're with us? - And because of that. You're right, yes. You will sleep very well here. It's quiet, you can work. Guys, it's ready, come to the table. Let's go eat. Here we are. Anita, turn off the phone. - She's with the phone all the time. What if your mother didn't give birth to you with a phone in her hand? Last video, now it's enough. If she just accidentally found this one, she could stay, right? What are you going to do - an open relationship? Let's not overdo it. But I could forgive her, right? What if you make her jealous? - What does that mean? Go out with someone else ... Dario, we're not in high school. - No, that always works. Are you doing that? - No, I'm out of the game. Ever since I met you. - Right? Of course! - What love! I don't want to bother you. Should I leave you alone? No, Anita and I are coming home after dinner. Tomorrow the workmen come. Are you making repairs? Yes, another bathroom, to rent it out to tourists. I convinced her to live here. Yes, so we'll see now. - Okay, we'll see. Dario, can you borrow me your car? Yes, but not to go to Chiara. No, I forgot some books in the faculty. Chiara? Chiara? Chiara? What are you doing? - I came to get clothes. Overnight? On my computer? Hello, Max. I knocked, saw that the lamp was on, and I was worried. The dog is afraid to stay alone. There were fireworks near Alessia's house, and I had to bring him here. Is that a trick? - No, I told you I was at Alessia. Strange, she has the same hair. - Stop it! If you're attracted to him, tell me. Everyone can stumble on someone. Guido, I already told you - I'm not attracted to anyone. Don't you like me physically anymore? - Don't talk nonsense. I don't understand anything anymore. two days ago we made love, and now I don't live at home. I thought we were happy. I told you how I felt. Where were you now? - By the pharmacy, my cycle came. Won't you say anything? - What can I say? Should I open champagne? What a fool you are! - Sorry. What did you do on my computer? - You're copying my disks. No, I'm just archiving them. These are my memories, too. What memories? - What did I say? Will you stop clinging to every word I say? I've been collecting them for years, do you suck them up in one night? Get them, then. No, this one doesn't. This is ours. - Exactly what will happen now? I do not know. See ... I was thinking ... Shouldn't we go to a psychologist? But why? I was wrong to say that the problem is only yours. If it's yours, then it's mine. - Okay, but why go to a psychologist? Everyone does it, what's wrong? - Married people with children do that. Are those without children less important? I don't want to tell other people about my problems. If we split up now, we will never get together again. How is it possible that only I care about us? Not just you, stop it. I'm just experiencing a moment of confusion. Then let's do it like everyone else. - Like who else? Those who separate and discard everything without effort. We don't throw anything away, \ I really care about us, but I need a few days to find out what's going on with me. I may be overworked and doubt everything. Okay, but what can I do? Will you give me some time? Can you? Okay. Are you leaving immediately? - I'm late. Are you sure? Do you want coffee? - I don't want coffee, Dario. See ... Shall we call? - We will calld. Bye. - Bye. Good morning. - Good morning. Do you want coffee? - Yes, thank you. Do you want sugar? - No. Did you know that Roberta would come? No, she called me - she was sad, she was coming home from work. She came out of here and did the stupid thing to tell her to get on. Did you fuck? - What was I supposed to do? This is not an obligation. - And what should I do? I am 40 years old. Again with those 40 years, Dario. - You'll see, that's right. You use one friend for family, the other for fucking. Guido, are you reading my morals? I'm just saying you've been with Tanya recently, invite her to live here. I know, and this was the last time Roberta was there. We talked and I explained everything to her, I told her about Tanya ... And about her daughter ... How did she take it? - Bad. Of course. I have to get ready. Roberta is a cardiologist, isn't she? - Yes, why? I've had a fast pulse for a few days, and my arm is tingling. Go and see her. I'll give you her number. Wouldn't she mind? - Why? Given the situation ... - Are you kidding? That's her job, she's a professional. I have to go. If you want, I'll take you. No, I will stay and continue my work. It may be stressful. I know the moment is delicate. Do you think it's because of that? - It's possible. Okay, we'll see now. I will increase the pace a little. Dario told me that you two ... Let's not take up the subject, because I'm angry. How do you get along in Rome? Okay. I don't know many people, I only know colleagues. So you don't go out much. - I go out, I go to concerts. Maybe I have not yet found many places that I like. Okay, I'm almost done. Okay, over. Will you remove these? - Yes. I think your heart is fine. I would say everything is fine. Very good. Then what could it be? Maybe the accelerated heart rate is only due to stress, and the tingling to be neuralgia. To be safe, I ordered an echocardiogram. These are yours. Call me later when you know. How much do I owe you? - Nothing. How so? - Really. No, I'm sorry. - You'll buy me a beer. Okay, when? - When you want. Okay, thanks. - No reason. Well done, Botay. I liked it, very interesting. But I would deepen a little the part about "Mr. Test". I think you can write more. Can't we publish it like this? - Are you in a hurry? We waited long enough. - Exactly. Tully's essay on Calvino will be published, and we can't help but quote him. Yes, but if we wait for everyone's sketches to come out ... Botay, let's not go into depth, it's stupid. Listen to me, a few more months of effort, and it will get better. If this happens with the scholarship, Is it possible to do research abroad for a while? Where abroad? Depends on the project. I was thinking about the USA, Canada ... I would say yes, you can go in a few weeks. And for a longer period? - But how? The other day we talked about Kreshi, now you want to leave? No, I just asked. - Let's not take things for granted. Let's focus on Congress and make a good impression, because nothing is certain yet. I dream of being invisible. When I'm in a situation in which I can imagine being invisible, I feel good. Just the opposite of the way I feel now with this camera pointed at me, to my physique, to my face. I don't think it's useful for writers to be seen live. There are many popular writers, of which nothing was known, they were only the names of the covers. Who were Gaston Leroy or Maurice LeBlanc? They created the myth of Paris to stay in Paris. There are writers of whom didn't even know their first name, and yet they were popular among millions of readers. We don't even have a portrait of Shakespeare, from which to understand what was his face, his biographical data not tell us much, but now the writer to borrow so much, that the world he represents is emptied ... Hello? - I'll kill you, you bastard! Who is it? - You know who it is, I will kill you! Fool! Is this one for you? - I said I'd kill you, asshole! Guido, disconnect it! Who are you? Can you hear me? What are you doing? - Who is this idiot? No, it's been going one for 3 years. - This one won't bother me because I stopped it. I'm telling you, it's him. She left him, when he's drunk, he calls once every few months. He said he wanted to kill me. - It's not for you, it's for your father. So we are ok then? What's up? - Marco was on the phone. What should I do? - It wasn't me who created this mess. I told you a hundred times - let's go to file a complaint, you refuse. Don't you understand he has a reason? - Please don't start again. Look, it's 2 o'clock at night, turn off the phone and go to bed. I'll take you to the pool tomorrow. - I'm not going! Didn't you say you wanted to lose weight? - I'll lose weight when I decide. Enough! - Do what you want. Good night. For all the sacrifices I make, see how they treat me. You know what it's like. - Yes, it's disgusting. Won't you go to bed? - No, I have to get the job done. Is there any news about Chiara? If I tell you something, will you be angry? I don't know, Mom, tell me. - I was thinking about what she told you. As a mother, I don't want you to suffer, but as a woman I understand her. What do you understand? - How does it feel. To be with your father, I came to Rome, I gave up my job ... She hasn't moved. - I know. If she feels dissatisfied, try to understand her. Before giving up a man, a woman must think carefully. Thanks for your concern. - Good night, treasure. What are my underpants doing here? They belong to Chiara, she left them in the bathroom, I have to give them back to her. I returned them a long time ago. And didn't you see their size? Goodnight. Sorry, I went to get aubergines. What happened? - Pietro has gone away. Did he discover what happend? - No, I have told him. What? I didn't want to, but we started talking. I couldn't stop. And where is he now? - I don't know, he turned off his phone. Didi he go to Corso? - He doesn't know where he is. And does he know that I know? - Can we not talk about you? And does Corso know? - No, I didn't mean to disturb him. But when you had to fuck ... - We didn't fuck! God! - What's up? I think I broke my water. - How come "maybe"? I'm not sure. - What else do you think it is? Pee. Why do you need to pee? - Don't you know anything about women? This is the heartbeat, this is the normal rhythm. We will pass by from time to time, but if you see any change, call us. But how will I know? - Don't worry, you'll find out. If you don't see anything, so the cable is disconnected. Better someone else come, I don't understand anything from computers. From computers ... You don't understand anything. What do you say, ma'am? - Yes. Can I get you some water? - Yes, thank you. Lucia, I don't know if I can. - You wanted kids, didn't you? If I'd known you'd give birth I would have stayed. - God, don't make me laugh, please. And Jacopo? - She's with Stella, sending you greetings. I'm fine, calm down. I called your parents, they're on their way. - And yours? They will leave tomorrow morning. I leave it to you. - Thanks. I'll be out for a moment. - Guido? Thanks. Yes. Here, I'm outside. Hello ... Hello, Corso. The birth has begun. We have to wait a while, yes. No, Pietro is here, stay calm. I understand you ... I know you love her. I'm here at the hospital. How are you? Do you think that this is crazy between me and Lucia? I do not know what to think anymore. Because sometimes I think about it. This is something that worries me a lot. Does Lucia know? - Yes, of course, and she's scared. Doesn't the fact that you're both afraid scare you? Yes, it's normal, isn't it? Why don't you go home? That way you will get some sleep. Even without that, you have to wait here for hours. I can't - once I'm alone, I feel this anguish. Do you want sedatives? Are they natural? - No. No, I prefer to wait with a clear mind. Is she sleeping here with you? - Where else to sleep? It will be so now and next week the new crib will come. I do not know... Will more things arrive? - Yes. Come on, you can wake up, let's go. How's it going? - More or less ... Why? You look good. - Yes, but ... What's up? - No, just ... I shouldn't have invited her here. - Why? When I saw the boxes, I panicked. This is normal. This moment will pass. Do you think so? - Yes. Don't worry, you'll see it pass. - Yes, but if it doesn't? If it doesn't work out, you'll talk to her. You didn't go to get married, did you? I miss Roberta a little. - I know, Dario. Roberta left. On the day of the examination, did she ask anything about me? No, but she told me she was ok if we drank a beer. Just a beer to fuck? - What a fuck? Only beer, Dario. Maybe she wanted to tell you something about me. I do not know maybe. Do you mind? - No, do what you want. Are you sure? If there is something ... - Do what you want. Hello, darling. - Hello. Hello, Guido. - Hello. She's asleep. - I went home to get my clothes. You did well. - How did it go with the little one? Okay. He ate everything. - Well done! Hello, Guido. - Hello. Will you stay for dinner? - No, thank you, I was just leaving. Come on, we'll be happy to stay. - No, thank you very much. Are you sure? - I told our parents I was going home. Shal we swim the last lap? Again? - Come on! No, I'm very cold. - Come on, let's swim. Why don't you teach at school? I think it suits you. Is that right? - I signed up for the list and they call me from time to time to replace someone, but I always refuse. The school has become very bad. If the best teachers don't go there, it will be bad. Thank you for the rating, but I don't think I'm appropriate. And it takes a lot of patience. - Do you think it's a job for women? Why are you speaking like that? Because now the upbringing and education of children are delegated to women, because they have a lot of time to lose. Leaving aside the summaries, I don't teach at school, because after so many years of studying my ambition is not to talk to children who don't listen to me. Do they listen at university? - No, but at least they pretend. If one of your colleagues teaches in school, will be less scandalous? This is not true. Pick it up, calm down. - She's my mother, then I'll call her. Your mother at this time? - Yes. Whatever. Let's not argue, but would you work as a nurse? That is a different education. - With us too. The story is full of writers who taught at school. How is this relevant? Is everything OK? No, my father is ill. My hand is sweaty. Try to call. We called 2 minutes ago - And why doesn't he pick up? It may have been muted, to view it ... I parked incorrectly. Will I be fined? Enough, Mom, what fine? - Come on, try again. Dad, hello. How are you? I'll give you mom. How are you? Are you okay? Father? Be calm, yes. We are here. Bye. Mom, if you call, to bother him ... Chiara is here. Hello. - Hello. How is it? - There is tremor. Yes, he told me, but did it pass? - They are considering whether to operate on him. Thanks for coming. - No reason. Go see him. - I'm going. Father! Guido ... How are you? - More or less. And your mother? - She's out here with Chiara. Who called Chiara? - Me. Do you think this is the time? Look, I was immediately picked up. My phone is home. Delete all messages. - What are you talking about? Delete them. Do you think now is the time? Sit down if you like. You can't stay here. Excuse me, I'm his son. Any news? It seems the heart is in rhythm and there is no need to interfere. We'll watch him for another hour, then he can go home. And what should we do? - He just needs lots of rest. Thanks. - I noticed stiffness in my movements and I was wondering if you noticed any delay, limited expressiveness, tremor ... Sometimes people start to write smaller. In fact, he writes more finely, why? Don't worry, but just in case, I would recommend a visit to a neurologist. Is it serious? I don't know, it needs to be reviewed, but we will remove the doubt. Doctor, two persons arrived with many injuries. I have to go. Wait for him outside. Goodbye. Hello. - Hello. You didn't pick up the phone. I thought I could help you, and I came. I gave my phone to my father. So, how's it going? - Okay, he'll go home. I'm going to the cafe. Do you want something? - No, thank you. If you don't need me, I'll leave. Goodbye. - I'll come with you. I'm sorry, I panicked and called Chiara. Calm down, Guido. It's normal, bye. Don't you want me to accompany you? - Go easy. Be careful with the bike. - Let's go home, I'm tired. Bye. - Bye. What's wrong? Did you ask Roberta for advice? We went for a beer. And since when do you go to drink beer with Roberta? Since she broke up with Dario, I asked her for advice. Enough, Guido, fuck you! - What's up? First you tell me, that we shouldn't do like everyone else, but at the first opportunity drink beer with another. It's not what you think. - Then why did you know about your father? Did you fuck her? - What are you talking about ... Are you jealous? - Yes, why? Can't you? Of course you can. Did you put cream inside? Did you notice if my father's handwriting was larger before? Maybe you're just suggesting. What's wrong? I do not know. Isn't it working? Not much. Look ... - Tell me. Yesterday I spoke with Rebecca and we made an appointment on Skype. So you're leaving? I think so. And the two of us? Why did we make love? Because I'm scared. - But why? Because I don't know what's right. What if I come with you? - Enough, Guido ... Really, I'll come. - And your job? I'll always come up with something. I can teach Italian. And then? - I don't know. I think I want to go alone. Do not you love me anymore? Enough... Do not... And the entrance fee? - Included. Given the prices in the area, ot a very good offer. The kitchen ... Do you plan to live here alone? Yes, it will also serve as an office for me, because I work a lot from home. You can use this room to the office, it is very quiet. Here is the bathroom ... The bedroom ... And this is the living room. When could I apply? - Immediately. Aren't you sure? No, it's nice, but I want to think a little. No problem, call me whenever you want. Thanks. - No reason. Sorry, but there are more customers. - Of course. Goodbye and have a nice day. Welcome, follow me. Did you find the house easily? Okay. Yes. Open your arms and clench them into a fist as fast as possible. Okay. Stand up and walk back and forth. Come. It may be the initial form of Parkinson's. Sorry, I didn't get it right ... I said it could be the initial form of Parkinson's, but we will do more research. If it's in the early stages, I'm hopeful. In what sense "hopeful"? In the sense that it is a disease that cannot be cured, but caught in time with appropriate treatment, can be kept under control and progress very slowly. Don't make them too salty. - Don't you trust me? I have you, but ... I made a little more sauce, it will stay that way for you. For which of us, Mom? - I know - for you and your friends. Okay, I'll freeze it, it can always come in handy. Do you remember how I taught you to cook? Yes. - How fast time passes. It's like yesterday. - Enough, Mom, don't cry. Why are you crying? - Because I'm scared. Stay calm. - I won't be able to do it alone. I'm here. - Yes, well ... People, aren't we going to eat? - I'm almost done, I'll set the table. What's up? - Nothing. Come on! Today you will sleep in your room, \ I will sleep with your mother. And what are you going to do with ... - I solved the problem. I bought the earplugs used by the drillprobe workers. That's enough, Alberto, I'll give you some probes! I took advantage of my mother and made her cook. Me too. - How are you at home? Okay. And the little one? - It's okay, she's with my mother. Did Pietro accompany you? - Yes. How's it going? - More or less ... Chiminieri is over and so are you. - Isn't there a lunch break first? You better talk first. People are always asleep afterwards. Well done, you did it. - Right? Let's go. Good day. The topic of my participation, as the title suggests, is the predecessor in literature of Calvino's novel "Palomar". We'll see Valerie's "Mr. Test" and Brecht's "Stories of Mr. Koiner." Palomar approaches the things that surround him, questions the perspective, that makes it look like us, especially when our usual view of things becomes more insecure than usual ... But at the same time Palomar, in search for the generally accepted ideal, in the end it always remains in anticipation. Ironically, I started thinking about these topics at a very delicate moment of my life, in which I was forced to change my perspective for things and pass this test ... Can you wait 10 minutes for me to finish? Parmesan is delicious even when eaten colder. I know this, because I made it yesterday with my mother. I think I deserve a little attention, don't I? So, we were talking about ... Botay, what did you do? - I know, Professor. Did you know that you insulted the members of the commission? I'm sorry, excuse me. He was great. - Yes, great fool. But he did well. Do you want me to take you? - No, thank you, I'll go alone. Hello? How did she kick you out of the house? I'm still in our house. Thank you. - No reason. Are you sure you don't want to sleep here? Don't worry, I'll sleep on the couch. You don't know what it was - she was screaming, the little one was crying. You'll see that tomorrow will be better. - I hope because it could also be worse ... So she'll stay with you? - Yes, until I find her a place to live. Do you have to move out? - She says I created the problem. I'll get you a towel. - Thanks. And the echocardiogram is fine. Do you have any more symptoms? In recent weeks - no. - Okay. Is your father better? - More or less. I'm here - if there's anything, you can call me. Thanks. Can I pay you this time? - No. How so? I am uncomfortable. Since you don't want me to pay you, Can I invite you to a concert? At the place I told you about. - Who will play? I don't remember his name, but I was told he was good. We'll see. - Okay. Bye, Guido. - Bye. Thanks, you are very kind. The song I'm going to play for you now, Dear viewers, is written at a time when I only wanted the pain of abandonment to leave me. Then, when he leaves you, you start to regret it or you write a song - so you can always experience it again. Because, as the poet says, who in this case is me, pain benefits as well as joy. One day you will find out there was nothing to change, there was nothing to fix, it was just patience and to wait for things, everything, to be fixed by itself. This day you will understand that passion has an expiration date and that it's just nonsense to look for the sky in a room. You like fairy tales, I know, is stronger than you. And your iron alibi rusts with tears to this fool in love with you, who even wrote a song, maybeing some illusion, that there is in your eyes that which does not actually exist. But this is just one moment, a mistake of the heart, which is always careful not to take the wrong step and never convinced of anything. It's just a moment, I swear, slight indecision on this heart of a fool, a servant to only one master, who is never convinced of anything, never convinced of ... And one day, I already know, we'll meet at a restaurant or in a store with vegetables to measure. We will say to ourselves: "How are you? How long has it been? Are you married?" And then, I know, we'll want to run, to undress and make love on that seafront. And the fear that they might see us, excites us, is stronger than me. And my cardboard dreams burned in the station cafe between a cappuccino and a cup of coffee, looking at an intercity train, it's like a spaceship, which in a minute will take you away from me. But is this just a moment? What's up? - I don't know. Is something bothering you? - No. You can tell me. Maybe the pictures in the living room. Why, are they ugly? - No. No, for a moment I felt like I had to start all over again. I told you you needed time. I know, I'm sorry. Do you want me to go? Where are you going? - I don't know, home. You don't even have a home. - Yes, it's true, I hadn't thought about it. Listen I am hungry. Let's make pasta? At 2 p.m.? - Okay. What if we try it again? No, I'm hungry now. Is pasta with garlic and olive oil fine? - Yes, of course, thank you. Do you want help? - No, I'm ready. You have nice pants. Yes, I know, I live with our people and I wear whatever I find. Seriously, they're cute. - Namely, they're not the best. Why? What do you think? 5, 4, 3 ... ... 2, 1, 1 ... Come on! Change hands! Come on! Joyeta, raise your hands nicely! Come on! This is the class diary. By the way, there is a note which the previous teacher left. This is the anthology they use. I don't think so. Thanks. - No reason. Have a nice day. - And to you. Good day. Shall we sit down? - Yes. How are you? - Okay. I am Guido and I will replace your literature teacher. We'll see for how long. So who are you studying for? - For Hugo Foscolo. Hugo Foscolo, good. Which work? - His sonnets. The sonnets. And more precisely? "In the evening". - "In the evening", very good. Do you want to read it? Let's open the textbooks. On which page? Please? 206th, very good. Who will read? What is your name? - Fatima. Fatima, let's read "In the evening". "Maybe because of the fatal silence your image is so dear to me. Oh, evening! And when the clouds are summer and the clear sapphires happy they court, and when the sky is snowy, you lead long above the earth, you keep coming down called and on the secret paths you take my heart and make me wander in my thoughts from the footsteps of eternal infinity, at this point this wrong time is slipping away. " Hello. Sorry, there was no end to the meeting. - No, they did it all. Did I leave anything upstairs? - No, there's nothing left. Will the sofa stay here? Yes, the cleaning company will take it, thanks. So we're done? Yes, I'm coming. - Thanks. Anna will come on Monday for the key and return the deposit. I told her you were here. In the afternoon? - Yes. Yes of course. Well, bye. Thanks. For what? No, please. - Sorry. I was in yoga all morning, to come here and ... Will you call me when you arrive? - Of course. I'll call you tonight if you want. - As you see fit. I have to go. Bye.
