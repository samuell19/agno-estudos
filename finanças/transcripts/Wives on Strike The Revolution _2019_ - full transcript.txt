Baba Beatrice, pull yourself together. You're a man! You need to be strong, okay? If you are crying, what do you expect the kids to do? Mama Beatrice is gone! Just like that. Julie! This was not the plan. It is God who gives and takes. We cannot question Him. Death! Is that how easy death is? Are there any of your relatives present here? -No, they are our neighbors. -Who will look after them? Will you be able to look after them? I'm coming. I'm coming. What exactly happened to her? Where was her body found? Baba Beatrice said they had a misunderstanding last night, so she angrily left the house. It was this morning, he said, that they called to tell him her body was found by the junction. I don't know... Is it just her body that was found there? Iya Bola, maybe you can go check there, I don't know. You know there are a lot of people here, and the kids need to eat and rest. So, Madam 12:30 and I were considering if we should take them to my house. When all is settled and calm, we will bring them back. -Please, it's okay. -Thank you. Iya Beatrice! It hurts deeply! Let's go with them. Iya Bola, come. -I'm coming, I'm coming. This time... -Iya Bola! I'm coming. But the time she was taken to the hospital, - is it only the person... - I don't know. Come and let's see how we can carry them. -You know they said... -Nobody asked you! Carry her and let's go. Carry her. Can't you see what is happening? They carried her to... It's not here. It's okay, take his slippers along. What I'm trying to explain is she's been dead since yesterday. -Iya bola! -Well done. Madam, I'll be back. How is your husband? -Can you see? My friend, help her with it. -I'm watching you. My friend, quickly help her and get back on board so I can win the game. -I'll teach you a lesson today. -I can see you're running your mouth. When I won the bet yesterday, you almost cried, right? It's my turn to win the bet today. It's the money I won playing draughts that paid my school fees back in the village. School fees? Are you educated? Dullard! You asking if I'm educated? I'm educated. I attended a very good school in the village. If indeed you were educated, you wouldn't be working in the garage. Do you know if that's my destiny? If that's how destiny works, for you to be a bus driver, then I don't want destiny. -I don't want it. -I forbid it! Let me tell you, I believe in destiny. Watch out, watch out. Can you see it? Was I not the one winning a few minutes ago? When you're drunk, why would you be smart? Baba Dammy! -Where's your phone? -My phone? Ah! Thirty-two! Oh, sorry. -I didn't know... -Okay, don't worry. I asked you to drop the money at home before leaving the house. Where did you put it? - The money? - Yes! Okay, the money. Actually... I don't have it. -What did you say? -I don't have the money. You don't have the money? Baba Dammy, how will you get money? Your mates are working to earn money, while you sit here playing draughts. Well, I just thought to rest for a while. -You want to rest? -Yes... - How much have you made today? - For today? -For today. Yes. -For today? -Eh, I haven't made anything. -I'm dead! I'm done for! You haven't made any money today, and you sit here playing draughts. I thought I'd rest a bit. In fact, I'm not feeling well. God knows you aren't well! If you were well, you wouldn't be here playing draughts. - Ah! My mother did me wrong. - Bunmi, Bunmi... -Yes? -This is a garage, please don't shout. I will shout! I will scream! -No... -Help me! Help me! -Hello... -What is it? If you touch me again-- If you touch me, I'll bite you. I will bite you. -Easy, take it easy. -Baba Damilola! -Sir, ma... -Baba Damilola! -Ma, sir... -It's not your fault. My mother is responsible. When my mother asked me to marry you, if I hadn't listened to her, my life wouldn't have turned out like this. You're lucky you got married to me. -You see? -You'll meet me at home. -See why I won't get married? -You sit here playing draughts! How long have you known? Two years. I have cooked your meals. I've picked up after you. I've warmed your bed. Yet you chose to lie to me for two whole years! -No wonder-- -Look, I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Vera! I wish I could take it back. No wonder you stopped supporting my quest for a child. That is not fair. What is not fair is that my husband has a child by another woman and has known for two years, yet mentioned nothing about it. Knowing fully well that I have no child of my own. That, Aniete, is unfair. In short, it is downright wicked. I don't know what to say to make it better! Why didn't you come to me? Why? I stuck by you through thick and thin. You should've just come to me. You should've told me. Because of this. That's why I didn't tell you. I didn't want you to have to go through what you're going through right now. Because I didn't want you to stop loving me. I'm your wife. I'm your wife, you idiot! But right now, you disgust me. I can't even bear to look at you right now. -I'm sorry-- -Don't you dare touch me! Don't touch me. Don't... Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Why? Why? I know that we will all die someday. But the way Mama Beatrice died... Ah! Mama Amina, this is an abomination. I blame her husband. Because you know what happened? You know, whenever we close for the day in the evening, there is no escaping being tired. So, when Mama Beatrice got home, she was tired, so she couldn't make food for Baba Beatrice. When Baba Beatrice got home and was hungry, there was no food. As a result, they had a misunderstanding and started insulting each other. So, Mama Beatrice didn't want to get in a fight. So she walked back to the market-- No, I meant road. You know what she went to do along the road? She went to buy suya. -So on her way back from buying suya-- -Oh! Wait a minute, Iya Bola, didn't they tell us all what happened? You remember when we got to the house? You know she turned right, while you guys went straight and I was investigating. You better not tell such a story out there. And we shouldn't blame the husband. Is the husband one of the evil guys who murdered her along the road? When I was called earlier this morning, I didn't eat anything before leaving. You know, hunger leaves no room for other activities. Ask them to bring me moin-moin wrapped in leaf. Iya Bola, I'm fed up with you not eating and being hungry when you come here. My credit book is filled up with only your name. No, hold on. Have I ever owed you? Do you want me to show you my book? Your name is everywhere on it. So you understand that? If I was telling you about Christ, you'd claim not to understand Yoruba. Go ahead and eat, let me see. No problem, I'm not interested. Let me be on my way, because I don't... You see, we all know you're not going anywhere. - I'm not going. - Go then. We know! -Please, give Iya Bola... -Two moin-moin. Wrapped in leaf. I don't like the one in nylon, I'm told it's cancerous. The one wrapped in leaf. Beatrice, please eat. Please eat. Okay? After working hard, all that's left is to eat. Please move your legs. That's okay, the place looks tidy enough. It's okay, it's okay. -Where's the food? -Which food? -Am I not eating today? -Have you forgotten what the Bible said? -What did the Bible say? -He that will not work, should not eat. Did I not just return from work? -Where's the money you came with? -Okay. So, is that the determining factor? -Yes! -Okay, let me give you... -What? -Thank you. Okay then, bring my food. There's no more food. The food is finished. What? Didn't I just give you money for food? The money you gave me is for tomorrow. The food I prepared today is for just me, and I already ate it all. So won't I eat today? -I have to wait till tomorrow? -Wait till then! Ah! Is it till tomorrow... The money you collected from me now, is it not for today, tomorrow and next year? Beatrice! What is it? -What is it? What is it? -I'm scared. Don't be scared. It was a dream. It's a nightmare. Don't be scared. It's not a dream, ma. My daddy killed my mommy. I'm talking and you're talking. What's wrong with you? - What's wrong with you? - I'm sorry. -You won't listen, right? -I'm sorry! You won't listen, right? What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you? You won't listen, right? You won't take corrections, right? You won't listen? I'm sorry! All the time, I talk and talk to you, but you won't listen. Nonsense! I'll teach you a lesson today! Before you send for your father and other family members, I'll have taught you a lesson. Come here and raise your hands. Am I not talking to you? My friend, come here! Mama Beatrice? Mama Beatrice? Can't you take a joke? Come here! Mama Beatrice? Pius, what have you done? It's obvious you want me to give you a slap in the face. My friend, will you stand up from there? Stand up from there! Everyone's already asleep and you're still awake. You're watching TV. Hello, Mama Ngozi... Now? What is it? Are you sleeping in the guest room, or I am? I am. Mama Ngozi, what are you telling us? -So, how did her body get to the road? -Exactly! -What? I'm gonna kill him! -Come back! -Do you want to kill me? -What's wrong with you? -It can kill me. -What's wrong with you? A man that killed his wife, you think he'll hesitate to kill you? Please, let's think about this matter. This is a matter for the police. This is not a matter for police. We can all go together to the police station, and then the man may claim he didn't kill his wife. Then how do we prove that he actually killed her? Do you know the painful part of this thing? We may succeed in having him arrested and taken to the police station. What if he has connections there? It will then be his word against his daughter's word. Before you know it, they will conspire and claim that the girl is mentally deranged. Or maybe she was talking in her sleep. People can say anything! But wait, please wait a minute. So, is that how this man will go scot-free? -God forbid! -Who said he'll go scot-free? -I thought... -Madam 12:30... Who? I only said it's not a police matter. I didn't say he'd go scot-free. Uh-uh! Mama Ngozi, don't you know what you are supposed to do? This is Operation Gbomo Gbomo. That's it! That's it! Mama Ngozi knows who we should call. What is it? -Baba Amina. -You're not the only one with a husband. Hello? Shaka, we need you. Nothing hurts more than when a woman dies leaving her children behind. So, Mama Ngozi... you have done well by taking the children with you. - May God bless you. - Amen! Thank you, Mama Ngozi. Thank you very much! My fellow women! Yes, ma. Mama Beatrice's death is so painful. Which means that this life we are living, it is very short. Let's be very careful, especially at night. Mama Beatrice is gone and will not come back. She left her kids behind. We must render our help. Iyawo Prince will go around to everyone's shop to collect one thousand naira each. May we not have such a bad experience again. Amen! Iya Bola, keep quiet! Iya Bola? What is it? You're just trying to spoil things... Well done, ma. Thank you, ma. I was thinking that... even the Bible says that prayer is the master key. Yes? Jesus started with prayer and ended with prayer. - Yes. - Just as everybody, the lady in question, her death hurts deeply. It hurts me deeply! But if we move ahead to contribute money, it will appear as if we are begging. It's kind of... It's not good. We would appear as beggars. Or what do you think? I... Iya Bola? - One thousand naira! - Iya Bola? -Yes, ma. -We see what others are going through. Yes, ma. We pray so nothing bad happens to any one of us. Amen! That one thousand naira, not to worry. I will come and collect it myself. -Mama Ngozi... -Yes, ma? I salute you! Thank you very much. You're a role model to every woman present here. Including me! May God reward you. Amen! Okay then, pray for us, so we can go to our shops. Excuse me, ma, you know Mama Ngozi likes to pray gently. We need a firebrand prayer. - By fire, by force. - Yes! Let's close our eyes, so I can pray. Okay? This contribution of a thousand naira, it's to give to Mama Beatrice's kids. - We will provide it! - Yes! God, anyone who doesn't want to contribute, where they keep their money, their black purse, - let it go missing! - Amen! Also, God, let them know you're responsible for the missing purse. Amen! So they'll realize that, in this world, we're supposed to support one another. Yes! Why can a man not keep his manhood in one place? But he said it was just once. And he was drunk! You see, this is the devil's handwork. What is Mama Amina saying? May God punish the devil! Which handwork of the devil? Then let's go get our revenge! On our way, we will say we are going to be used by the devil. The devil is instigating us. Right? I'm at a loss, I don't know what to do. Hmph! Me too! - Do you want to leave him? - Leave him for who? Do you know what we've been through together to get to this level? Then you can't keep being angry at him. You have to forgive him. Mama Amina, she cannot just stop being angry with him yet. She has to teach him a lesson! Keep up with the anger, stay angry! But... Madam Vera, I was thinking of something. Why don't you adopt the child as yours? We all know you don't have a-- Shh! You know I don't have a-- I don't have a child of my own, right? If I bring that child into this house, don't you think that child will be a constant reminder of how my unfaithful my husband was to me? Ah... I'm thinking... Let's look into it together. You know, now that you've caught him red-handed, -that "sorroga"... -"Sorrogaty thing." - Yes, he'll agree to it. - It's surrogacy! That's what I said, Mama Amina. Correct somebody else. -He'll agree to surrogacy! Think about it. -You're right! Mm-hmm. At least I have something against him, because... He has no choice. I will use it. I will use it against him. -Yes! I just thought of it. -And it's very good. Madam Vera, now that we have concluded to know that you are happy, and everybody is happy with you, ask your maid to give us something to eat. I'm hungry. They're all hungry as well. I'm asking on their behalf. Oh, that's not a problem. Grace! -Grace! -Iya Bola! Don't worry, it's all right. Grace! -Grace! -Shut up! -Ha! -I wanted to help her. -It's okay! -Grace... Hello. I learned you dated this guy in the past. I hope it will not affect your work? No, boss. No feelings for him. Mm-hmm. No problem then. You know what to do. Deploy Operation 222. Yes, boss! You're the only one with a husband who doesn't stay out late, right? There she is. Shh. Well done. Madam Shaka. We thought we'd come inquire about the status of things. Has he confessed? -Give me some time, he will confess. -I trust Shaka 100 percent! -She's good at what she does. -You've told me that before. Shaka, let me ask. -Did you torture him a little? -Iya Bola! What do you know? They're supposed to torture him. They should beat him. He should be tortured a little. We know how to handle it. There's no problem. He'll confess! Like when exactly? Don't worry. He'll confess. - He'll confess. - I'll meet up with you ladies later. -Thank you! -Wow! Shaka, Shaka. Shakademus. Shakabomb. The only Shaka in Africa! Always on point, yes? - It hasn't been made public knowledge yet. - Really? -What? -What's wrong with you? What is it? -I should remove it? -Yes! Look here, if I untie it, you have to promise not to shout. I won't shout. There is no need to shout, because where we are is in the middle of nowhere. No one will hear you. But if you shout, you will be dealt with. Okay. T.J.? Why? Why what? -Why are you in this kind of job? -Times are hard. I'm tired of struggling. Is that why you joined a criminal gang? Can you imagine? Look who's calling me a criminal. I'm not a criminal. I'm not anything like a criminal. But you assist kidnappers to kidnap others. Right? Look here, we are a vigilante group. We don't kidnap for ransom. We only catch criminals. You know why you're here. Here's your food. Eat. When you're done eating, I'll be back to tie your mouth. How do I eat the food? Who are you asking? Ask Google. T.J.? -Baba Ngozi. -Yes? There's something I want us to talk about. What is it? Go on. Since that incident, Madam 12:30 has refused to have sex with me. Shh! It's not a laughing matter. How can a man last without having sex for a long time, huh? If I go ahead and cheat, I'll be blamed. But I'm sex starved! Calistus, stop that kind of talk now. Don't try that nonsense again. We won't plead on your behalf again. But why would she refuse to have sex with me? She's still upset. She caught you sleeping with another woman! You're lucky she's still talking to you. My friend, exercise patience. Okay? Take it easy with her. She insists I go for a medical check-up to be sure I'm not infected with an STD. I didn't know Madam 12:30 was as smart as that. Really? -You're in support of that? -My friend, go and get tested. I'm scared. Don't be scared. I'm not saying you're infected. But, assuming you are infected, you'd then transmit it to your wife. If both of you get sick, who will then take care of your kids? Think about it, think about it. Remember that one year we spent together? T.J. It was the best year of my life! Then my wife came back... And then family pressure, that's why I stopped seeing you. Please, I'm sorry. If you can forgive me, I promise I will be a changed man. And I will be able to marry you. Marry me? God forbid! I can't get married to a murderer! I can't! T.J.! Who told you that kind of thing? Where did you hear it from? You killed your wife. Or you think I don't know? I love you too, Pius. -But I don't want you to kill me. -T.J.! I can't kill you. And I didn't kill my wife. She was murdered on the street. Evil people are responsible for her death. Someone saw you when you carried her dead body from the house, and went to dump it at the junction around 2:00 a.m. So, do not lie to me. Tell me the truth, so I can know how to help you. T.J. Why don't you want to believe me? I didn't kill my wife. You're still not telling the truth, right? Okay. -T.J., please don't go. -You're not ready to confess. T.J. Um, Vera... If it will make you happy, I'm willing for us to try surrogacy. I will submit myself to the doctors for all the tests. And everything it takes. Vera, you cant keep shutting me out like this. I don't know how else to say I'm sorry, but I truly am. I'm willing to do whatever you want. - Shut up! Who's your daddy? - Daddy, please. Daddy! -Are you? I said-- -Please, I won't do it again! - Keep quiet! - Daddy. -Who's your daddy? -Daddy. You've been in this house without giving birth, and you call me "Daddy." - Daddy, please... - Never in your life! Don't ever call me Daddy again! Think I'm like your father in the village who didn't have time to train you well? Daddy, Daddy! Listen, look at me. My friend, look at me! How many times have I told you to keep quiet when I'm talking? Please, I'll be quiet, Daddy. -How many times? -Daddy, I'll be quiet, I'll be quiet! No, you never answered my question I've been asking. You never answered. How many times have I told you to keep quiet when I'm talking? How many times have I told you to keep quiet when I'm talking? You're crazy! Unfortunate being! I will kill you in this house! T.J. Please help me, I don't want to die here. -It's in your hands. -I'm pleading with you. I may be able to help you. You know. Please, help me. If I stay here, I will die. You see, if you help me, I promise you... I'll marry you. -And I won't deceive you again. -But you aren't being sincere with me, eh? The problem I have with you now is that you don't trust me. How can we get married if you don't trust me? If you tell me the truth, I'll help you escape. You could leave Nigeria for Cotonou. Because if you stay in Nigeria, my boss will kidnap you again. -Cotonou? -Yes! Okay then, I like the idea. Cotonou is okay. I thought you said you didn't kill your wife. Then why do you want to run? Huh? If you don't tell me the truth, I can't help you then. T.J. It was a mistake! We had a misunderstanding. She started insulting me, so I pushed her a little. She then fell on the ground and hit her head. I thought she was joking. I held her hands, but there was no movement. If I left her in the house, or if the police showed up, I would be accused of murder. I would be imprisoned! Who would look after my children? You could've taken her to the hospital. Maybe the doctors would have been able to save her life. Can't I tell when someone is dead? Look, Pius, I'll help you. But you know my boss. My boss is very strict. Just give me a few days. Let me prepare myself. Okay? -Don't cry again. -T.J., my wife is dead! Hold yourself together! Ah! T.J.? Please don't leave me here. I don't want to die here, T.J. The police has apprehended the man in question. Yes! Very good! And we must allow the law to take its full course. Yes! -Mr. Akpokiniovo! -Yes, ma? -Thank you very much! -Thank you, ma. We know you are solidly behind us! - Yes! - And you support us. That's why you came to give us the good news of Baba Beatrice's arrest. -He's in police custody. -Thank you very much! Stupid man! Now, listen to me, everybody. -We must act fast. -Yes, we must! -It must stop! -Yes. Mama Bukky was physically abused by her husband until she had a miscarriage. What about my neighbor? She lost one of her eyes to blindness because of domestic violence. What I have to say is that we can't sit back and watch these men treat us inappropriately. - Yes! - We are not drums. - Yes! - As for me, nobody can touch me. - Yes! - I will beat him mercilessly! That's it, Iya David. Sit down. We are not gathered here for your type. So it's better for me to be the victim? It's a lie, that cannot happen! -Yes! -Just sit down. Iya Loja, you know this domestic violence we are addressing. -Yes. -It's not particular to one gender. -Yes! -Men are guilty of it, as well as women. -And they are all wrong! -Thank you very much. -Iya David! -Yes, ma? With your Goliath-looking stature... Change your ways! It won't do you any good! You hear? Because you're the one giving us a bad name as women. So, change your ways! I knew it would work! Madam Vera, your husband is a good man. Yes. Really good. -Yes. -A good man? Oh, please. A good husband is not sold in the market! Can't you see how my own husband is far from good? -Okay, let me be quiet. -Ah! All right. So, well, that aside. Any news with the bird? Ah! The bird has sung. The bird sang very loud! In fact, it was so loud that everyone heard it. - So where is he now? - Ah! He is in police custody. He is going to get the full wrath of the law. -I pray he gets the death sentence. -Amen! That man is such an animal. Women need to be more aware. This is becoming unbearable. Thank you, God bless you. You see, that "wareness" is what we need. - "Aware." - Aware. Because you know what, some women think it's because they offend their husbands, that that's why their husbands physically abuse them. -False! -When she isn't his child... The most annoying are the women who claim their husbands abuse them out of love. - That is silly! - Yes! -Arrant nonsense! -Yes! The Bible says, "Spare the rod and spoil the--" -Spare the rod and-- -Shh! You don't know what she wants to say, so keep quiet! The Bible says, "Spare the rod and spoil the child," not "spare the rod and spoil the wife." That is rubbish! Our voices aren't enough, we need to do something. Yes! How can a man kill his wife? I heard he'd been physically abusing her for a long time. But why should a man abuse a woman in the first place? Women are foul-mouthed. Hmm! If that's the case, I would've killed my wife a long time ago. Before I say one word, Iya Bola has finished a sentence. As for me, whenever Mama Ngozi is trying to create a misunderstanding, I just tell her I have a headache, then I leave her and go to sleep. Or I come to the bar to drink. I'm not saying it's good for a man to kill his wife, but some women push you to the limit. Before you know it, you hit her in the face. And then you'll be accused of murder. What rubbish are you saying? It appears that's how you physically abuse Madam 12:30. If I try that, my corpse will be taken to the village. But you see, there's no problem without a solution. But physical abuse is not an option. Just like my wife, Mama Amina, her skin is spotless. I couldn't put a mark on that skin. So whose wife's skin is not spotless? Can't you see how my Iya Bola's skin glows? Let me tell you, it's the money from my bus driving that makes her glow. Which money? Please, stop bragging. It's possible that evil spirits influence men to abuse their wives. My husband, he beats me. You see this scar on my neck? It was one of those times he nearly killed me. I'm dead! I'm dead! Iyawo Prince, how could you not tell? You chose to cover it up. We've been considering a strike for a long time. - It's time to go on the strike. - Yes! - Iya Loja? Strike? - Huh? Yes. Let us look for another way to resolve this matter. -Which other way? -Because... Cutting off the head is not a remedy for a headache. Please, let's consider other... This last strike-- -Mr. "Akpofororo"-- -Akpokiniovo! That's what I said! We did not ask for your advice. - Yes! - It's our business, and we will handle it. Government officials. Where is the camera? - This strike won't be like the last one. - Yes! - You have to quickly respond to us. - Yes! - We will not succumb to any plea. - Yes! - We will not succumb to any plea. - Yes! - It is time to fight for every woman. - Yes! We will not take sides with any form of female discrimination or use it as an excuse not to fight for this cause. -No! -Thank you. What is it? Give it to me. I'll hold it myself. There's nothing wrong with my hand. Where are the press men? Government officials! We're giving the government a deadline of one week. If the government doesn't put a stop to domestic violence, we go on strike. And this strike will entail total abstinence from sex. - No more sex! - Yes! - No more up and down. - Yes! - No more sideways. - Yes! - No more! - No more! - We are locking up! - Yes! Take your microphone! Where are the government officials? Come and cover this. Where are they? Come and see! Raise your neck, so they can see it properly. Where are they? - A man did this. - Look. Wow! Let me speak Yoruba. Governor, the men are destroying us with violence and it's not good. -Do you see what I'm seeing? -I see it. Wow. Is that how another strike will begin while we watch? Let's be calm. They haven't said they're embarking on another strike. While we sit and do nothing, these women will proceed with the strike. Let me tell you, I can't survive another strike! You're right. I nearly died of sex starvation the last time. What kind of smart women are these? Can you imagine? If I'd known, I would've married a girl from the village. They're the worst. I'll give my wife a stern warning this time around. She cannot! If you refuse to listen to us, then we have no choice but to strike. Yes. So you... Before you say anything... please remember that a woman was murdered, killed by her husband, whom she loved and trusted. How long are we going to sit while our sisters and our mothers are being abused? And another thing I want to ask for, Father Lord... is that Mama Caro in the market, who's a pain in my neck, let her move out from that line-- Oh, Baba Ngozi! Baba Ngozi, can't you see I'm praying? Can't you see I was praying? I've been telling you to stop calling me "Baba Ngozi." You should make an effort to be romantic. Oh, yeah, sorry. My king. Now you're talking. Let's go into the bedroom, so I can show you I love you. Ah! Baba Ngozi... - I have severe body pains. - What? You can't have body pains now. You should have seen how stressful today was for me. - You can't have body pains now. - My head aches. -Hey! I have enough medicine. -I'm tired. -Ngozi, medicine won't cure this pain. -You can't be tired! -I'm tired! -We're going three rounds. -What? What is it? -Aren't you going on strike? Let me tell you, I will keep collecting until my storage is full before the strike. No, no. Please, that's no excuse for you to exhaust my body. -Okay. -Baba Ngozi, stop... Jemima! Jemima! -So you're still sexually active? -Why won't I be sexually active? Okay, come and show me how sexually active you are. Calistus, leave me alone. I've told you I won't have sex with you. It's possible you're infected with an STD and you don't know it. -It doesn't show on the face. -All right, have this. Have it. What is this? Look at it. I hope you can read what the doctor wrote. Look, the ones indicated with a minus sign shows I'm negative. You see, I'm clean! I'll still take it to the market to show Mama Amina. So she can help me with the ones I don't understand. Okay, then have this. -Take this. -What is this? I used all my money to buy land for you. -This has Jemima Njoku written on it? Wow! -Yes, of course. Good land in a good location. With government consent. In fact, you can start building a house there now. -So I'm now a landlord. -That is it! Cali, Cali... Jemima! Since you have acted right, I will have sex with you. -Really? -But you have to take it easy. Don't moan, you know the kids are asleep. No way! I can't promise you that. As far as we're concerned, it's till dawn. Anyway, that's even better. So you can quickly collect all you need. -You know we're going on strike again. -No way! Don't say such a thing. You see? Just because you've bought me some land, you now want to control me, Jemima. Uh-uh, Cali. Wait! I said you will take all you need now. Instead you're complaining of how I've been on strike since-- -Why have I been on strike with you? -It's okay. You've been cheating on me with every woman you can lay your hands on. -Why wouldn't I be on strike? -Let's go inside already. Hold on, what is this? What is this? Take this away from me and bring me the big Coke! Stella! Take that gum out of your mouth before I hit your head. Get out of my face before I hit you hard in the face. I don't know how my niece got this bad. What is it? Do you want to poke my mouth with it? Iya Bola, I'm sure you know the price of this is different. - Do I owe you? - Iya Bola! -Let me be on my way. -Sit down, I'll pay for it. Just let her go one day! What is it? Look who's here! -Mr. "Akpoforovo"! -It's Akpokiniovo! That's what I said. -I greet you. -You met us well. Please sit. How are you? Well done, well done! Please come. Tell me what you want, and I'll tell them. What do you want? Give me, two moin-moin. With a large-sized beef with side mirror. Please bring two moin-moin, and beef with side mirror. Did you come here because of moin-moin? Don't harass my customer. Besides, he always pays for his food. -His name is not on my debtor list. -Welcome, sir! Oh, wow! Standard Sandra! Please, don't address me as "sir." Just call me Akpos, okay? - I've heard you, sir. - Standard Sandra! -Don't address him as sir again. -Standard Sandra. Akpokiniovo! Don't tell me you're interested in this girl. I beg you in God's name, okay? As for this Sandra girl, leave her alone! This girl's trying to change her life. Please leave her alone! Madam 12:30, I'm not corrupting anyone. Have you heard? I'm not corrupting anyone's life. Meanwhile, I have good news for you ladies. Okay then. I knew something else brought you here. -As you know, the other time... -Yes. The police were investigating... -Mama Beatrice's house. -Uh-huh. On getting there, they see blood. -So, she died at home? -Yes. -I said it! -No, you said she died on the road. So they took the blood sample to the lab for testing. After running the test, they discovered it's the same as Mama Beatrice's. Hey! Let me tell you something. -Madam 12:30! -Yes? If you want us to celebrate this good news, as a good person, you see all this food we have eaten, you won't charge us. You will then order more moin-moin and beef with side mirror for free. So we can celebrate with... ♪ He has given us victory I will lift Him higher ♪ Vera? I just want you to know that... I completely support what it is you are doing with the market women. I do not care what the party thinks or how it makes me look. I also want you to know that I stand against domestic violence in any form whatsoever. So if there's anything you want me to do to help, behind the scenes, of course, all you have to do is ask. Thank you, Aniete. You're a good man. We'll be fine. Okay? Time, they say, heals all wounds. But that doesn't mean I will not join the strike. Drat. And here was me hoping my speech would help. Give it to me, let me hold it. What are you saying? That it's up to the law to do what? Didn't you hear that he willingly confessed in front of a camera -how he killed his wife? -A confession. -Which court? -No, no, I'm fed up! Nigerians, you've seen that we're serious about this issue we're addressing. -This domestic... "vance" of a thing... -Domestic violence. Domestic violence. -You heard what she said. It's serious. -Yes! If the government refuses to listen to us, I trust my fellow Nigerian women. When we talk to them, they listen to us. No sex, means we have locked up! -Women! -Power! -This is our strike sign. -Yes. Mama Ngozi, look, she did it with us. I told you! When I saw her approach us, I knew she was a good woman. -What did you say? -I'm woman too. Exactly! Good girl. -Are you sure they're looking at us? -Yes, they're looking at us. Then don't laugh. Let's frown so they know we're serious. Here... - My brother! - What is it? Hey, the government has let us down. -What happened? -What happened? It's evening already and they have yet to answer our wives. Oh! That means these women will begin the strike tomorrow. What kind of temptation is this? We won't sit and fold our hands. We must do something. There's nothing we can do about it. These women are not backing out. If you saw the way Mama Amina talked to me yesterday, I was weak. I know Mama Ngozi will be the cheerleader. She doesn't listen to me. I'll call Mr. Akpokiniovo. -Yes. -Yes. My wife, there's a new bar around this neighborhood. I want to take you there to eat "point and kill." -Point and kill? -Yes. Be it point-and-kill fish, point-and-kill goat meat, or point-and-kill pork, you're in for enjoyment. That is, pork meat. When we're done eating the point and kill, I'll take you home. So when we get home, -you'll show me your special skills. -That's what you're all about. That shows you're still the young lady I married years ago. That's what you're all about. My husband, if that's the case, we need to go home quickly. Because by 12:00 midnight, the strike begins. As soon as it's a minute past 12:00, all the women agreed at the meeting, a curse will be placed on any woman who has sex with her husband. Where? What-- Uh-uh. Help me! Help me! Help me! Stop! Stop! Ah! What is all this? Do you want to hit the fence with the car? Okay, don't worry. It's 6:30 p.m. now, right? Let me just take you home now to have sex, and have as much as I can before the strike commences. Not to worry. Next time, we'll go for the point and kill. Baba Dammy. Baba Dammy. Baba Dammy! Get up! Stand up! -My dear. -Yes. It's morning already? It's morning already! Get up and have your bath so you can go to work. But before we go, let's have one round of sex for the day. What do you want to have? -One round. -You've played yourself already! The strike commences today. -What? The strike has commenced? -Yes, it has. -Strike? -Yes! Okay, we could do this one last round before the strike begins. Did I make you miss out? Who made you sleep here? Is it not alcohol? -Did I force it in your mouth? -Just one! Just one! Really? What about ten? Okay, it won't get to one. -Half! A half round. -Why not take five? -Five is too much. -Get out of here with your nonsense. Come here, it won't be long. Just 20 minutes. No, no, no! Baba Dammy, leave me alone. Let go of me. I'll bite you! I'll bite you, I'll bite you! Come here. I've told you, look at this restaurant. If anything happens to my auntie, I'm inheriting this place. What is it? By that time, you'll be a cleaner here. You see that last statement you made, you lie. God has the final say! If you don't work hard to have your own business, you'll be broke. -You'll also be broke! -Let's bet on it. -You'll be broke! -Let's bet on it. Today's not the first time I've told you this. Get out! Richard, my lover! Baby! - Toothpick! - You know, there's no one like you. I swear it, I can die for you! -What's up? -See how you're flattering me with words. Sit down, what do you want to eat? Baby, you know how it goes, serve me my favorite, eh? I know. Then after you close for today, we'll go where isi ewu is sold. Then, when we're done having isi ewu, we'll go home and have sex. Well, as for the isi ewu outing, I'll meet you up there. -Good girl. -But as for sex, it won't be possible. Baby, why is that? Are you having your period? -Aren't you aware the women are on strike? -And so? Are you a woman? Hey, you. Hold it. What is she then? Hermaphrodite? Mary Magdalene! Please mind your business, so you don't meet bad luck. -You'll meet bad luck. -You see, my dear, you won't join in the strike. Baby, don't mind those irresponsible women! What did you say? What? You know what? Leave! What did you say? My boss and her friends are irresponsible? -And so? -Are you raising your fists at me? Stella, brief him. I'll give you ten seconds to get out of this shop. -I'm waiting for you. -All right, off you go. I'll meet you for the isi ewu, but... as for sex, it has to be after the strike. Baby, don't worry. I'm not buying the isi ewu again. Don't bother yourself! What? Richie, so because I'm refusing you sex, you don't want to buy me isi ewu again? -I'll see you later, baby. I'm leaving. -My friend, get lost. We know your type. I'm going to bed. Okay, good night. -I said I'm going to bed. -My husband, I heard you. -Aren't you joining me? -No, not now. Okay, I'm hungry. My husband, you just ate a few minutes ago. The other hunger. -Baba Amina, we're on strike. -You-- What? Don't tell me that. The women are on strike, but you are not! Don't join bad gang, huh? I have to finish stitching this dress. The owner is coming for it first thing tomorrow morning. See, my wife, this is no big deal. We will stitch together in the other room. Huh? Please. Mama Amina! I can't let my sisters down. Dear women of Lagos State, I've taken notice of all your grievances. First of all, I would like to applaud your strength and your zeal in fighting for what is right. The issues of domestic violence against women is dear to my heart and my government is committed to doing everything within our purview to fight this menace. Lagos as a state already has a dedicated team to handle all issues of domestic violence, especially against women and children. The domestic and social violence response team, already set up, is a collection of professional service providers and officials that respond as a group, and in a timely fashion, to all complaints of domestic and sexual violence from survivors or would-be victims. And they do this by providing legal, medical, emergency assistance, counseling, psychological and psycho-social support. We frown on domestic violence, and it will not be condoned in this state in any form or fashion. We urge women who are experiencing any form of violence to speak out and seek for help. Believe me, this help is available to you. I will also bring up this issue at the next council of governors meeting. And encourage all governors in every other state to adopt the same level of response to domestic and gender based violence. In light of this, I would like to use this medium to implore all of you, our dear women, to please, now, call off the strike. God bless you all, women. Thank you very much. My husband, good evening. ♪ My sweet wife ♪ ♪ My darling ♪ -Welcome, my wife. How are you? -Thank you, Baba Dammy. I'm fine. What is the matter? You came back early today. What is wrong? How was work? Work is okay. Nothing is wrong. Work is all good. My wife-- My wife, just take a look. I have plenty of money in my wallet. It is because of you I made this much, it's all for you. Hey! It's a lie! -It is not! -It's a lie! I'm glad to see you're happy. -It's a lie! -It is not a lie. -My husband, this is the change I wanted. -Mm-hmm. You're my husband. You're supposed take charge. All those irresponsible ways of living I've been involved in, I've stopped them. -You see, it lets me make you happy. -Okay. Just go into the room with me now, so I can make you very happy. Baba Dammy... -Yes? -We're still on strike. Strike? What type of strike? Didn't I see the governor addressing you women on television a while ago? That's the governor of Lagos State! Don't you women have respect? Why would you say such a thing? We're not talking about respect! We'll do things at the right time, and in the right place. This money you were about to give me, don't give me again. I'll go in now and prepare you a delicious soup with seven lives. After eating it, you'll give me the money from the bottom of your heart. I'll still give you the money? Yes, of course. Okay, then give me a hug. Let me hug you. My husband, let me hug you. Hey! What? Let me go make your food. My husband! Ladies, we cannot ignore the governor. It doesn't look good. And let's not forget, we're not here to fight the men. We're all married women and we love our husbands. So this is not to punish them. Madam Vera, how about the women who do not live in Lagos? Exactly! It will appear as if we're betraying those women. They have not addressed the issue of women in governance, handling women affairs. - God bless you, Iya Bola! - And you too! Iya Bola, it is left for us women to clamor for it. "Clamofor"? Who is "Clamofor"? It means, as women, it's our responsibility to make it happen. Yes. It's the truth. Because during elections, women don't contest. Because they always feel they won't win. - Yes! - But if women come out, and we as women come together for support, why would they not win? Exactly! You're making a lot of sense, because according to statistics women are more than men. A campaign is a brilliant idea! That's what I'm saying. Yes! That means the strike is over. Keep quiet! So that means all this while, you've been craving sex. Oh, my goodness! I have good news, ladies. - Please tell us. - What is the good news? Our campaign for the girl child didn't go unnoticed. So we've been invited by two organizations, one in France, and the other one in London. So pack your bags... You don't believe me? -Stop that! -You know Madam Vera is pulling our legs. -Would I joke with a thing like this? -What? Pack your bags! Passports and visas will be expedited, and we will travel very soon. -Mama Ngozi! -♪ Thank you, Lord ♪ -Is it me that wants to travel? -I'm traveling abroad? You know, I have said it, it's at this juncture we'll know who's the boss amongst us. As I am, I have six passports. Two of which have a black background, while the other four have red. Shut up! You think that's what she's referring to? -Isn't the one taken as a close-up shot? -Keep quiet! She's talking about a photo! She's referring to the booklet type, it's a traveling passport. - Is that true? - Six passports indeed! -Yes, Iya Bola. -Really? Don't worry, you'll have your own. It'll be taken care of. Wow! The women who embarked on a nationwide strike have now officially called off the strike. The governor responded to them in a statewide broadcast... These women, who are already very smart, have now traveled abroad. Mama Ngozi was already too much before. Now that she's traveled abroad, when she returns... she'll just be showing off. Her feet won't be on the floor. Like this. I know my wife. When Madam 12:30 returns, as for me, I won't give her attention. How will that help you? If I give her attention, she'll show off. -Is that right? -Yes, of course. -That's a good strategy. -Yes! Let me tell you guys, Mama Ngozi called me. Hello... Baba Ngozi, can you hear me? I'm calling from London... They already have a British accent. When did they get to London? I told her to keep quiet! -Don't you know who you're talking to? -That's something Madam 12:30 can do. Madam 12:30! I miss her troubles. It is times like this that we appreciate the work that our organization puts in to reach out to men and women across the world, and educate them on the rights of women and children, especially women of color in the diaspora. Today, we celebrate this group of women who stood their ground against child marriage. Their stance has been heard across the world and even pierced the ears of African leaders. Their message was clear. Stop the menace, and stop it now! The catalyst for this message and this stance is a little girl called Amina, who thankfully is in a boarding school back in Nigeria. Please welcome her mother, Amina Musa. Thank you. Thank you. Um... Honestly, I would not be here today if it was not for my friends. Mama Ngozi, Madam 12:30, and Iya Bola. Let me also thank the very gracious, Vera Isong. When I learned Amina was to be married off, my heart broke. Yes, she had been betrothed almost at birth. But I thought she would at least get to age 18. I know the problems associated with early marriages. I know young girls who have struggled with childbirth due to the immaturity of their cervixes and have either lost their lives, lost their child, or both. I've seen firsthand vesicovaginal fistula ravage young girls, leaving them unable to control waste passage. I've heard of young girls who commit suicide after being forced out of their parents' houses into a husband's house. I would've failed Amina, but for these wonderful friends. They stood up against it. Let us come together and say, "No," to child marriage. Thank you! Ms. Vera Isong, any words? Sure, thank you very much. Thank you, everyone, for having us here today. Societal issues like this prevail because the most affected do absolutely nothing and let the bad people in government make rules and laws to suit them only. For how long we will continue to strike and protest? It is only a woman that can feel what the other woman feels. -Yes. -We need more women in government. Yes! Women, we need to wake up and take our future! Thank you. Madam Vera! My brother, let me be on my way. Dupe! Dupe! Thank you so much. As for me, I appreciate you. -Aw, thank you. -Thank you. I have a little something for you. -For me? -Yes. Wow! -What is this? -It's money, of course. -Money? -Yes! Dupe! So you are now an adult. Where did you get this money from? It's the Tony Elumelu Foundation grant. You know, it really helped my business. -And my farming business is booming now. -That's good. Iyawo, I have something for you too. Yes, for taking care of my brother. - Sister Dupe, thank you. - You're welcome. - Thank you! - You're welcome. Sorry, Dupe, do you think that is necessary? Of course, it is necessary. Is she not taking very good care of you? Look at how you're looking good. Please let me be on my way. No problem! All right then, be on your way. Bye, take care. Yeah! Okay, Dupe. Give my regards to Mama Kudi. - Okay. - Okay? Tell her I will come by to see her. Three... where is the money? I think I'm here talking to someone. I said, where's the money? -Daddy, it's here. -No problem. How much is this? Five thousand naira, sir. Do you think I'm blind? Where's the rest of the money? It was 5,000 naira she gave me, 5,000 naira only. Have I ever lied to you? I go to the market and return to show you all the money I make. -I've never lied to you before, Daddy. -Forget that! What's the meaning of that to me? Give me the rest of the money! Okay. As a matter of fact, remove your clothes. I want to search you right here. I want to search every-- Daddy, she gave me only 5,000 naira. That's the money there! Believe it or not, that's your business! Please, I'm fed up! Wow! Remove your clothes! I want to see what is inside there. I say no! She gave me 5,000. That's all she gave me. That's what I gave you. I'll deal with you today! Don't worry. Leave me! ♪ He has failed ♪ ♪ He has failed ♪ What happened? What happened to me? You fell. Me? Prince... Adebanjo Omoboriowo? I fell? I said you fell. That's what you'll say when you're asked. Prince, you abused me to the point that I had three miscarriages. Three miscarriages! My children, all gone! This is the last time you'll touch me! Because the next time, if you try it, I will kill you! And that's a promise! As soon as we arrive in Nigeria, I'm going to court. What? Mama Ngozi, what are you gonna do in court? Baba Ngozi called me in regards to Baba Beatrice's case. -The case is now in court! -I'm happy! -Yes! -I'm very, very happy. You see the court? I can't wait for us to get there. -Yes! -So I can spit on Baba Beatrice's face. Ew, why do you sound so disgusting? -Who sounds disgusting? -It's okay. -Is it me? -Sorry. I don't have your time, devil's advocate. You know what we discussed about this "dodo"... -Domestic violence? -Mm-hmm! What we talked about. They didn't address it in the conference we came to London in the first place for, and we're leaving already. But you know Madam Vera mentioned that this conference -is about the girl child. -Yes. The one for domestic violence is the one held in France next month. Ha! I'm now an "overs" lady. That's what we all are now. It's "overseas." Going forward, we will be engaging in woman "empowernes." No, it's "woman empowerment." Do you ladies know that, finally, it's here in London, that Mama Amina and I will engage in our final fight! -I agree with you! -Whenever I'm discussing with my friends, you've made a habit of correcting me. Did I ask for your correction? What kind of nonsense is that? -Are you going down? -Are we? Going down? -Please come to my aid. -But we are going down. We are going up! By the grace of God, we won't go down. -I'm not... -He was referring to the elevator. -He was referring to the elevator. -I will not go down. When we were going to meet Madam Vera, we were asked the same question. Wow! Don't be in a hurry, don't rush it. It's done gently. Okay, then. You can hug me now. Let me show you how it's done, then you give another one. That's how they greet each other over there. The London we visited is extraordinary. -Hey! -Welcome! You will see husbands when they go shopping, their wives just walk behind them. -Really? -When I saw it, I was amazed. I said to myself, I have to teach my Cali this type of lifestyle. Please, Nigeria is hot, or are you not hot? It is hot indeed! As soon as I landed, I started feeling hot. But you know, I'm only here physically. My spirit is back there in London. -Your spirit is still there? -Cali, Cali! -I missed you very much. -I missed you too! How are the kids? In there. They are fine. -What did you bring back? -Cali, it's as though you've lived abroad. This is how husbands carry bags for their wives. Take these along with you too. That's how they carry everything. If you will learn it, then learn it all. Carry them! -Hey! -You-- You have to stop this. Just look at my husband, he's learning fast. All right, come with them. Follow me! -Why has Bosco been sleeping here? -Ah! He said Iya Bola didn't let him sleep last night. She kept talking about her trip to London up until this morning. -What kind of talk is that? -It's all about their travel experience. Yesterday, Mama Amina was sharing all she bought from London. Really? She kept talking about London Bridge and the London Eye, London... -Seriously? London has eyes? -London has many eyes. Mama Ngozi kept showing me different pictures of London. I'm fed up with all this talk about London! What is it? -Calistus. -Bosco! Bosco! What is it, Iya Bola? I don't want to go see London Bridge. Is it by force? Good morning! You're sitting on a bench. It's okay. But wait, let me tell you, I missed you ladies. -Aw, we missed you too. -Thank you. But when we got to London, then I knew communicating in English is not so simple. -So now I can speak it very well. -Very good. - Quim! - Really? Yes! You know, they don't talk with their mouth open. Quim! Innit? What did she say? Iya Bola, you forgot how they-- They say it this way: It's a beautiful day, innit? Wow! Madam Vera! Wow! See how sweet it sounds, hearing you speak with an accent. You know, when wealthy people speak, their English sounds better. Yes! Okay. You've spoken and every other person has also spoken. Since you're back, we already had a meeting while you were away. What did you learn there that will be of benefit to us here in Nigeria? -Plenty of things. -Many things. Iya Loja, a lot of things. But the most important is, women over there are influential in government. -Yes. -And over there, issues that affect women, -the government takes them very seriously. -Yes. Then what are we doing here? That's not all, Iya. If a "mans" fight a "womans," -the "mans" will... -Women. She's telling the story! Mm-mmm. She thinks I'm talking about one. I'm not talking about one, I'm talking about-- general language, all "womans." Like we are all "womans." -So if a "womans"-- -Women. When you cover your hair, you must have covered your brain. -What is this madness? -Well done, Wole Soyinka! -She doesn't listen. -Pardon me. - You still listening, ma? - I'm listening. So if a "mans" do something to a "womans," -the man will be arrested. -Instantly! -What? -Yes. - Madam Vera, is that so? - Yes! That means, any woman who is bold enough to contest for office, - we will fully support her. - Yes! So, that is our responsibility from now on? Very good! - Well, mama... - Yes? -I want to run. -I'm finished! Run? Where to? Mama, no, I... I want to run for the office of a local government councillor. What? Mama Ngozi has ruined my life. What you mean by that? -Oh, my dear friend! -Mama Ngozi wants to run! - You're not qualified. - Why not? Because all she needs is standard six, -and standard six is primary school. -I checked. Mama Ngozi is more than qualified! - I checked. - Ha! Mama Ngozi! -Yes, ma. -Take a look at me. Take a very good look at me. Wow! Iya Loja! I'm solidly behind you! I was here when Tinubu contested. I influenced his win. Yes! What about Fashola? I also influenced his win. Yes! And Ambode? A responsible, and intelligent man! He also came, and I influenced his win. What about local government chairmen, how many can I recount? And now you tell me you want to run for councillor. You don't have an issue! You're in already. You're a winner! Never! Baba Ngozi, why? Because I'm the man of the house! And I say no! No is no! My husband, please think it over. Mama Ngozi, you might as well wear my trousers for me. Baba Ngozi? You want to be the man of the house? -Baba Ngozi, it hasn't gotten to this. -Just wear my trousers for me. -My husband... -Just forget about it. My husband, don't act like that! Don't be so adamant. You're the husband. If you ask her not to do it, she won't. Until you permit her! You see, this issue we are addressing... we want you to rethink it. If we don't come together, how do we bring about change? -Exactly! -I will be sincere with you. I like how quiet and peaceful my family is right now. I don't want my wife to be exposed to politicians, and then begin rubbing shoulders. -I don't want that. I don't want stress. -Not at all! Rubbing shoulders? Is this the same Mama Ngozi we're talking about? Politicians are good at corrupting others. No! Mama Ngozi is a good woman! You know your wife. Because any woman who is successful knows her home comes first. We as women, we respect our husbands! What? -Why did you make a face? -I'm agreeing with what you said. Indeed, you respect your husband. I'm not offended by that, because I know what you mean. My case is different. Baba Ngozi, you do take alcoholic drinks, right? But you are responsible. You don't get drunk into a stupor. My husband drinks until he's wasted and they pull him out of the gutter. If I'm not strict with him, he won't behave himself. I'm thankful to God, my husband has changed his ways. All we are saying, in essence, is that you give it a second thought. Please! He has thought it through. He has accepted! Joy! Joy! What is it? You're supposed to understand what I'm trying to say, it's been two weeks already. What is it? Drop the tray, I'll take it to the kitchen for you. I thought you were angry with me. As beautiful as you are, why would I be angry with you? With this beautiful shape of yours! Put this tray down. I'll take it to the kitchen. No! I cannot, I'm not interested. I have a headache! My friend, come back! What is all this rubbish? Imagine! I'm flattering you and you're letting it go to your head. My friend, will you drop the rubbish in your hands and let's go inside! What did you say? What did you say? I said... I said you should come back, so I can go get medicine for your headache. Please don't do this. Don't treat me like this. Take my phone, call Mr. Lomilopoto. Tell him to come here. Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! -Thank you! -Have you called him? This is our campaign office. Who placed this poster like this? It's not properly done. You're supposed to calculate, and arrange it properly. -How do you know it's not straight? -It's geometric! Geometric progression! Please let's share the food. Wow! Madam 12:30! Let me serve the food. It's okay to cry, Beatrice. -Let it all out. -It's okay, darling. What you did is very brave. Not very many young women your age could've done the same. I understand how you feel. It's not easy to testify against a man you love and call father. But the truth is, he murdered your mother, who you also love, in cold blood. So as much as you should forgive him for your own peace, he must pay. So, my darling, you've done well. The nightmares will stop with time. I just want you to know that you will be okay. But if you ever need to talk at any time, your auntie has got my number. Call me, okay? Your auntie also has my number, okay? You're not alone. I and the other women are here for you. - Ejiro! - Whose picture am I holding up? Ejiro! Whose picture am I holding up? Ejiro! Mama Ngozi! Well, this is a new development for us. A development that we welcome greatly. Yes! You're very bold for taking this step. - And you will not regret it. - Amen! So I'm going to warn everyone, I don't want to discriminate between political parties. This is not about a particular political party. - It's about Mama Ngozi. - Yes! So everybody should come out, and vote for Mama Ngozi. - We will support her, and she must win. - Yes! By God's grace. If she goes into office, it is for our betterment. Yes, that is it! - That's how it will turn out! - Amen! She is my wife, and I always show her support. As soon as she told me of her intentions to run, I gave her the go ahead. That is amazing! In fact, we need more men like you in Nigeria. Men who are not afraid to support their wives. And push them forward to excel. You're a hero! Thank you! So, tell me, Baba Ngozi. If your wife wins now, which I believe she will, considering all the support she's getting, both locally and internationally, are you prepared to take the back seat? Back seat? I don't believe in taking the back seat. She is my wife. And the man is the head of the family! What I mean is, if she'll be more out there than you, probably even run for governorship in the nearest future, is that going to be a problem? When we reach that river, we will cross it. Evil people are responsible for me being here. They accuse me of killing my wife, your mother. But you know me, I can't do such a thing. They just want to destroy our family. I saw you. You killed mama. -Beatrice. -You killed my mother! For all of those years, I blamed myself... for not being able to help her. All the time you were beating her, and she was too weak to defend herself from you. In the end, I know I did the right thing. It was right of me to tell them what you did. You reported me? You're responsible for me being in prison. Beatrice! Why? Will I die here? Beatrice, will I die here? Why? I'm sorry, Baba! But you have to pay! I did not mean to kill your mother. It was a mistake. It is wrong to beat a woman, Baba. I know! You don't know! If you knew, she wouldn't be dead! Now listen, I'm going, I will never come back here to see you again. Forget about me and my siblings. Don't say that! I want to see you grow up, I want to see your brother grow up. I want to see your sister grow up, Beatrice. You don't deserve it. Beatrice! Beatrice! Please don't go, Beatrice! Beatrice! Beatrice! Councillor! - My honorable! - God made it possible! I want to also say a special thank you to my husband. -My husband, you've done well! -Please give him a round of applause. Baba Ngozi, if you hadn't given consent, I wouldn't have run for office. I gave consent! But since you gave consent, my husband, you're a hero! And then, Iya Loja! Mama! Wow! You made me win. Yes! You know when she was mentioning politicians she has helped in the past, some of us doubted it. -But we believed! -Both of us didn't doubt her. We know that without your influence in Lagos, nobody can win a government office. Yes! A round of applause for her. And my fellow market women, you all are amazing. -Yes! -Three loud praises for yourselves! Okay, thank you.
