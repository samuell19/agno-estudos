(bright music) (wind blowing) - [Mel] All right, check this right here. - It's nice, it's good. All right, looks pretty good. - Okay, tight enough? - Yeah, that's good. - You okay? - Yeah. All right, feels good. Yeah. - Everything's right here? - Yeah. - [Mel] All right, Larry, can you hear me now? - Yeah, dad. - [Mel] You get me loud and clear? - Yes sir, loud and clear. You about ready? - All right, guys, here we go. Let's bring it up. Okay. All right, honey, just straight. There's the 60 foot mark, right there. - Yeah. - There's 40 foot. - Okay. - Okay. Five, four, three, two, one, lift off, lift off! - Whoa! - All right, honey, beautiful. Okay, take that big breath now. - Yeah. (uplifting music) (Karin laughing) This is great! Larry, you see me? - Okay, Karin! You look great, Karin. Real good now. Now just keep your arms bent. - Okay, I'm doing it. - All right, all right. (people chattering) - [Karin] Yeah. - You look great. (Karin laughs) - [Karin] This is just terrific! Oh! - Okay, now look, you're starting to drift out over the water now, a little bit, so we need a right hand turn to get you back towards the beach. Honey. - What? - Honey, you're not responding. - Dad, what's going on? - [Karin] Larry? - [Mel] Karin, honey. All right, look, look, I think you're gonna take a swim, now. - [Karin] What? - When I tell you, you take a big breath and push out, and then grab that D-ring when you hit the water and cut yourself loose. All right, you ready? Here you go, honey. All right, push out! (ominous music) (Karin whimpering) (people chattering) (Karin panting) - You okay? - Yes. Forget it, I'm fine. I'm fine. - Just take it easy. Well, you were doing okay for a minute. - Why were you watching me? - I always keep my eye on a pretty girl in a kite. Just in case I gotta save her life. - You didn't save my life. - Maybe not. Guess you're lucky I was watching. - Karin, are you okay? - Aw, yeah, I'm fine. - Are you sure? - Yes, stop fussing over me. - Here, get this off. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm okay. - Okay, all right. Yeah, looks like you're fine. Thanks. - Yeah. - Mel Nichols. - Richie Valente. - My son, Larry, Richie. - Dad, I'm really cold. Can we go? - Yeah, here honey. Larry, take her out to get a, get a blanket on her. - [Karin] Hey, thanks. - Yeah. Hey, what's your name? - Mel, food's here! - [Mel] Okay, Joanie, be there in a minute. - Come on, Lar. (doorbell ringing) Coming! (doorbell ringing) - Karin, dinner! - Hi. - Larry, let's eat. - Okay. And keep the change. - Thank you. - Thank you. - All right, let's get into this. - Okay, what did you get there? What's the surprise this time? - Did you get egg rolls? - Just look and see. - Yeah, he got egg rolls. Hey, there's my girl. Hi, baby. - Hi. - How you doing? - Oh, fine. - You feel okay? - Yeah, considering I made a fool out of myself on the beach. - And not to mention almost wasting her hang glider. - Tried to get my bearings there, I just couldn't. - Look, it was your first time up. You did okay. It'll be fine next time. - Next time? Mel, are you crazy? - Just take it easy, Joan. She got caught in a cross current, that's all. I mean, it can happen to anybody. - Got your egg roll at 12 o'clock, your vegetables at three, your fried rice at six. Next time she might not be so lucky. - Mom, come on, lighten up. - Here we go again, huh? - Joanie, you know how much she wants to do this. We've been over it and over it. We gotta let her take her knocks. - This is more than just taking knocks, Mel. We have been over this and over this. It's real dangerous, not that many sighted people go hang gliding. - Mom, it's not that dangerous. The worst thing that could happen, happened. I got wet, so what? - That is not the worst thing that could have happened. What if that boy hadn't been there? - I can swim, mom, I'm not helpless. - You're not exactly Superwoman either. - Okay, guys, um, let's uh, let's just drop it until we've eaten, all right? We'll talk about it tomorrow or something. - Yeah, sure, so you can avoid the subject? - [Karin] You mean I got in? - We just received the letter today. - Oh, I can't believe it. I'm going to college in New York, this is fantastic. - Of course an out of town school will cost more. - Well, my parents have been counting on putting me through for a while now. - That's wonderful. Now you should really think seriously about the daily living skills class. - Yeah, I'm planning to look into it. (car horn honking) - Want me to sign you up? - Oh, that's my brother, I'd better go now. I'll see you later, Barbara. - Now think about that class, Karin. - I will! (sticks pattering) Larry. - Yeah. - Do you have to be such a jerk honking your horn like that? - Watch out. Yeah, well when you drag me away from band practice you don't even have the courtesy to wait outside. - Wait a minute, I called mom, not you. I didn't know you were practicing. - Watch your stick. Yeah, well not that there's anyone else around here. Where to? - To the shop. Enrique called, he said he had a surprise for me. Wouldn't tell me what it was. - That's the emergency? - I'll make it worth your while. - Translation? - I won't ask for another ride for a week, okay? - Yeah, just put it in writing. Here we go. - [Karin] So you're having fun with the band, huh? - [Larry] Yeah. I just wrote a new song. It's called "Chauffeur Blues." - [Karin] Well, it's kind of apropos, I guess. - [Larry] Yeah. We're here. - [Karin] Okay. Thanks, Larry. - Yeah, see you later. Don't, don't slam it. - Okay. Bye. - I told you, the cut is still too dark. Oye, Karin. - Hi. - I'm mad at you. - Why? - I've known you since you were a ticky thing this high, and you don't even let me know when you get a boyfriend? Hm. - What? - This guy named Richie. - Who? - Richie. He's called a half a dozen times. He sent you these beautiful roses. This guy's in love. - I, I don't know anyone named Richie. - Karin, come on. - No, really. - Oye, Karin, don't fool a fooler, you know. - Enrique. - Yeah. - Hi. You gotta do it again. The color is off. - Dad, did you see my flowers. - Um, yeah, I did, honey. Uh, something a pretty girl like you has got to get used to. Honey, you don't need this in here. I don't want to see it. - Hey, Mel, um, Tyson Pharmaceuticals called up, they have a rush job. They want to know if we can handle it. - Okay, I'll talk to them. Then they gotta talk to you. You got a ride? - Uh, can I wait for you? - No, uh, call Larry, he'll come and get you. Okay? - Dad, I want- - Honey, I'll talk to you tonight, all right. Take care of that. - Don't mind him, it's just that a new printing firm has just moved into the territory and he's gotta keep our regular customers happy. Okay? - Yeah. (phone ringing) - Telephone, hang on. Mel Nichols Printing. - [Richie] Hi, this is Richie. - Oh, hello, Richie. Just a minute. - Oye, Karin, it's the boyfriend you don't have. - Hello? - [Richie] Hi, Karin. This is Richie Valente. - Do I know you? - Yeah, the guy that didn't save your life, remember? - How'd you get my number? - [Richie] Well, that's a trade secret. You like the flowers? - They're beautiful. - Great. Listen, um, I was hoping maybe tonight we could have dinner, see a movie. - I'm sorry, I'm busy. - [Richie] What about lunch tomorrow? - I, I can't. Um, thanks for the flowers, but I'm, I gotta get off this phone. I can't tie up this line. - She's crazy about me. (calming music) (water flowing) - Bye, everybody. - [Kids] Bye, Miss Nichols. - Karin. - Huh? - Hi, it's Richie. That was great with the kids. - Um, you were watching? - How come you didn't tell me that you were blind? - How'd you know where to find me? - They told me at the print shop. It doesn't matter, I would really like to take you out. Truth is, I haven't stopped thinking about you since we met. - Sure. - Here, I brought this for you. - Oh. - Anyway, I would really like to take you out. - Um, no I, um, I don't think it's a good idea. - Hey, Karin, I don't have anything against people who can't see. You got something against people who can? - No. - Well then, what are we talking about? Seven o'clock, okay? - Um. - Tonight. - Fine. - Fine. - Okay. - Do you want me to walk with you a little bit. - Um, okay. - [Joan] Larry, let's go. He's here. - [Larry] What, oh, come on, mom. - Larry. - Oh, wait, wait, wait. I think Karin can handle herself tonight. - Mel, he may have saved her life. We don't know anything about this guy. (doorbell ringing) I want Larry to go with her. - He seems like a nice kid. Now what are you worried about? - I'm worried that we're sending our daughter out with a total stranger. - I'll talk to him, all right? Hi, Rich. - Hi. - Mel Nichols. - I remember. - Yeah, this is my wife, Joan. - Hello, ma'am. - Hi, Richie. - And Larry you met. - Hi, Larry. - Look um, Karin's not ready yet. Why don't we go in the living room and sit down. - Okay. - Richie, I want to thank you for saving Karin's life. - Oh, it wasn't all that serious. - [Joan] Can I get you a drink? - [Richie] No thanks. Great house. - [Mel] Karin, Richie's here. - Richie, I hope you don't think I'm being too direct, but have you ever dated a blind girl before? - No, ma'am. - Do you realize that there are special circumstances that have to be taken into account? - Well yeah, Karin did mention a few. - Did she mention that she's never been out with a sighted boy before? - No, ma'am. - And that when she has gone out with unsighted boys, she always has a sighted escort. - But I'm sighted, so that would kill two birds with one stone. - Which is very true. - Just for this first date, I would like Larry to go along with you. Just so he can show you some of the things you have to do for Karin. I'm sure you can understand my concern. - [Richie] It's no problem, ma'am, if that's what Karin wants. - [Mel] Well good then, 'cause that's what we're gonna do. - Well here I am, ready or not. - Hi, Karin. - Hi. - You look gorgeous. - Oh, thank you. - Well, what are you kids up to tonight? - Gonna check out a concert. - Oh great. - Like that classical music, huh? - Dad. - Nice to see you again, Mel. - All right. - Nice to meet you, ma'am. - Nice to meet you. - All right, bye. - You have a good time. - Okay. - [Joan] Have fun. - Bye. - Come on, come on. - Bye honey. - Bye. - Thank you. (Joan sighs) - [Karin] Um, Larry. I think we can handle it from here. - Wait for me! - Look, I don't want to be here either, but mom insisted. - I know, but tell her I checked him out and he knows what he's doing and you didn't see any reason to be here. - You realize, of course, you're asking me to risk life and limb. Not to mention the keys to my car. - I'm the one she'll come down on, not you. Please? - Well, okay. What the hell? I'll see you later. - Wait, Larry. Is he cute? - Yeah, he's cute. Just like me. Come here. Rich, I gotta take off. - All right. - You guys have fun. - You're leaving? - Yeah. - Oh. - Take it easy. - Okay. Let's go. - What? - I said you look beautiful. - Oh. Um, you too. - Thanks. Stay close to me. - What? - Nevermind, we're gonna get closer. - I'm sorry, I can't hear you. - It's all right, nevermind. ♪ And I hear the night ♪ ♪ Ah, hear the night ♪ - I told you not to talk to her! None of your business! - Richie! Richie! Richie! Richie. Richie! Richie! Richie! - Karin! Karin, are you okay? - How could you have let go of me in there? - Karin, I didn't let go of you. - Don't you realize that when I can't hear, I'm lost. - Karin, I'm sorry, I really am. But the crowd was impossible. There was nothing I could do. - Look, it doesn't matter. I just want to go home now, all right? - Look, come here. Can we just try this again? - No. - Karin, I will be more careful next time, I promise. (Karin sniffling) - No. - Karin, trust me. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. - You already did. I just want to go home, okay Richie? - Okay. Yeah. Come on, let's go home. Except you better realize something. That you just can't run home to mother every time something like this happens. - This has nothing to do with my mother. I was depending on you. - I am doing the best that I can. It's just gonna take a little time, okay? I really want this to work out. Please don't give up on me yet. - If it happens again, I'm going to sick Larry on you. (Richie laughs lightly) - Okay. - Okay. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - Okay. - Come on. Want to go get something to drink? - Yeah. (Karin laughing) - I guess I should have told you it wasn't a classical concert, but. - Well, I had my doubts. - Well, next time we'll go to a symphony, all right? - Oh fun. - Here, step. - Okay. Thanks. - I got you. Well, all in all, it was just a moderate disaster, right? - No, I had a good time. Really, it was all right. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Well then, let's do it again sometime. - Yeah. I'd like that. - Karin, do you want to feel my face to know what I look- (Karin laughs) - Oh, sorry, no, I don't. - Can't believe I just said that. - It's not necessary. - Well, is it okay if I kiss a blind girl on a first date then? - Um, yeah, I guess so. - Come on, I'll walk you in the rest of the way. - No, that's all right, I'm fine. - Yeah, you sure? - Yeah. Um. - Okay. - Uh, Richie. Larry, Larry told me you were cute. (Richie chuckles) - He said that, huh? - Yeah. I'll see you later. So to speak. - Goodnight, Karin. (endearing music) - I know, I know. I'm just trying to tell you what I think. - Well why should I date someone because he's blind or not date someone because he isn't? Mom, the important thing is that I like him and he likes me. - Well, that's great, but I think it's possible he gets some ego satisfaction out of helping you, and then what happens if the novelty wears off? No, honey, honey, I don't want the marigolds there. I want the periwinkles. - [Karin] You don't even know Richie. - Well, Karin, neither do you. I just think you have to realize it's not as easy for a sighted boy to understand what you go through, and he may not want the responsibility in the long run. - Well how are we gonna be able to find out unless we get to know each other better? - Karin, I just don't want you to be disappointed, that's all. (phone ringing) I'll be right back. - [Karin] Come on, tell me where we're going. - [Richie] I can't tell you that, this is a surprise. - [Karin] It's a pier. - [Richie] How did you know that? - [Karin] Well, I can hear the shooting gallery and the carousel. I can smell the fish frying, and I can hear the waves hitting the pier. - Karin, that's incredible. I mean that's really incredible. Karin, how long you been blind? - I've never seen anything. - Never? - No. - Well, would you like to show me around then? - Yeah. I can do that. - All right. Here we go. (Karin screaming) Oh, no! - Did you make it? - Close. One more, yeah. - Come on, the wet ones are the lucky ones. Get 'em on there. - Okay, give me a kiss for good luck. - No. - Ah! - Oh! - All right, let the lady try, let the lady try. - No, I don't want to. - Yeah, yeah, you gotta try, come on. Okay, two tries for the lady. - I can't aim. - Yes, of course you can. Here, come on. Hand on the hammer. Okay, take your other hand, that's what you gotta hit, right, right there. - Okay. - Okay? And you're trying to put it in a little thing. Just hit it. Okay, foot forward. - Okay. - Okay, one for practice, two, three! Oh, so close! - Oh, it was? - So close! Okay. I feel it, I feel it. You loose? - Yeah. - You ready? Okay, here we go. All right, hand around it. - Okay. - Feel it again. Okay. Practice. - Okay. - Okay, one. - Yes. - Two. Whap it, three! Oh! - I did it? - You did it! Champion! - Another one. - Do I win something? - Oh my God, look what you're winning here. - What? - It's huge. - Right over here. You got it, you got it. That's good, baby. - Look what you won? - Oh my God. - Chocolate. Mm. Oh, sit down, chair. - Would you draw her picture? Get your picture drawn. - All right. Are you gonna be in this, too? - Yeah. Woo, an opening! (Richie screaming) - Oh no! - Straight ahead, we'll ram it. (endearing music) (Karin laughing) You're ready for the freeway, Karin. - It doesn't matter! Oh. (Karin laughs) - Look who's here. - Hey. - I'm home. - Hi. - Hi, sweetheart. - Hi. I smell barbecue. - [Mel] Yeah, your timing's perfect. - Yeah? - Look at this. - Oh, hi. I went to the pier and I won this stuffed animal and I found these seashells. And, oh, you'd never guess. I drove Richie's car. - Oh, great. - Great. - Um, I have a surprise for you guys. I was waiting for the right moment, and this, I guess this is it. I got my college acceptance letter. - Aye! - Oh! Honey, that's wonderful. (kisses smacking) - All right, which is it? UCLA or State? - Uh, Whitfield University. - What do you mean? The one where Christine's going? The one in New York? - [Mel] Boy, that's a hard school to get into. - Yeah. Yes it is, you should be real proud of yourself. How come you didn't tell us you were applying? - Uh, well, you knew I wanted to go to Whitfield. - We hadn't planned on you going to an eastern college. - Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. You're not really thinking about going there? Oh, Karin. Do you realize what you would be up against going to a school 3000 miles from home? - Um, yes. Christine is gonna be my roommate and she's been there for a year, so. - I've talked to Christine's mom, she's not having an easy time of it. - No, oh, that's not true. Mom, it's, it's not true. - I thought we had agreed. You know that we think that a local college is the only logical place for you to go. - I can't believe I'm hearing this. I mean, I should be able to pick the college I want to go to, and Whitfield's where I want to go. - How are you planning to pay for it? - Well, I, what is that supposed to mean? Mom. - It means, how are you planning to pay for it? - You won't pay for my education unless I go to the school you pick? - I can't agree to your going to New York, no. - Dad. - Hey Richie. - Yo, Eddie. - Hey Richie, what do ya know, what do ya say? - Nothing much, nothing good. Eddie, this is Karin. Karin, this is my buddy, Eddie. - Hey, he's been talking about you all the time. Now I see why. - Thanks. - Sit down, sit down. What'll ya have? - Um, I'll have a Coke. - You got it. - I'll have what he drinks. - [Sports Announcer] Gonna go to the bullpen. - Aw, come on. - Poor Lasdale's having trouble with his change-ups. - You're into baseball? - Eh, sorta. My dad and I watch it all the time. - Hey, she's okay. - I know. - Hey, she's terrific. - Hey, are you flirting with my girl? - Yeah. - This guy's unbelievable. (Karin chuckles) - Here. - Thanks. - So tell me something. What's so special about this college in New York? - There's this blind professor named McManus. I have read all her books, she's really terrific. I want to study with her. - So what's the problem? - Well, my parents won't help with money if I go to Whitfield. - Why? - They don't want me to leave home. - I can understand that. - This is serious. - Yes, I know. It's very, very serious. You want to dance? Come on, let's dance. - No, I don't dance. - Of course you do, everyone dances. - Not without radar. - Come on, come on. ♪ Slow dance all night long ♪ ♪ I wanna hold your hand ♪ Give me your hand. - Ah. - Come on. ♪ I want to hear your heart beating ♪ ♪ Know your body's speaking ♪ - No, look, let's stop. - Look, come here, come here, just. - [Karin] Wait. - On top of my feet, okay? ♪ I want to slow dance, cheek to cheek ♪ ♪ Slow dancin', we'll be slow dancin' ♪ ♪ Slow dancin', we'll be slow dancin' ♪ You okay? - Fine. ♪ Cheek to cheek ♪ ♪ Slow dancin', we'll be slow dancin' ♪ ♪ Slow dancin', we'll be slow dancin' ♪ ♪ Slow dancin' ♪ ♪ Feel your heart beating ♪ ♪ Know you why you're speaking ♪ ♪ Slow, slow, slow ♪ ♪ Slow dancin', we'll be slow dancin' ♪ ♪ Slow dancin', we'll be slow dancin' ♪ ♪ I wanna hear your heart beating ♪ - Thank you, that was wonderful. - I told you you could dance.

Could you teach me how to dance like that, on my own feet? - Why not? - I mean not with, well not with anyone watching. Just by ourselves, okay? - Okay. (drums beating) - Larry! Larry! - What? - What are you doing? It's seven o'clock in the morning. - Well it's the only time I have to practice. See, starting today I have to spend the rest of my time down at the shop with mom and dad. - Why? - Well, business is bad. Dad had to lay everyone off. So goodbye summer. (drum beating) Goodbye music. (drum beating) And goodbye girls. (drum beating) - I'm sorry. - Yeah right, well, at least you don't have anything to worry about except dating Mr Gorgeous, right? - Larry, nobody told me dad was having trouble with the business. - Yeah, well you never hear the bad stuff. Look, this is my rehearsal time, so you're just gonna have to get used to it. Bye. (drums beating) - And to the left we have the bathtub, the shower, dirty laundry. - Okay. - And through these doors, like the old west, ma'am, we have home. - Sounds like a big place. - Yeah, it is. - Uh, you reach down her to your right. - Oh. - It's a couch. - Put my bag there. - And, just pair of glides. Bend down and that's your table. - Uh-huh. - And over here to the left, just sit down. - Whoa! Oh, it's a swing. - A basic swinging chair. - That's great. - You like that, huh? - Yeah. - Okay, rise up. - Oh. - Alrighty, and straight ahead have the television. - Oh, color or black and white? - Black and white. - Good. - And there's a table to your left, and keep going straight, ta-da! - Oh, wow. Are these oranges. - Yeah, it's my jungle. And here's an orange for you. - Oh, thank you. - And straight ahead we have my work table. - Oh, it's a drafting table. - Yeah, that's very good. Hang on, I got one thing. - Okay. How long have you lived here? - Oh, a couple of years. Found the table. - Yeah. - Want to show you something. - Huh? - This was my mother's dancing trophy. - These figures are dancing, right? Like we were. - She was a ballroom dancer. After she married, she quit it to have me. And then later on she used to give lessons in the neighborhood, you know, to make extra money. - And that's how you learned how to dance? - Yup. She would dance with the male students and I would dance with all the female students. - I bet you liked that. - Oh, none of them were like you, Karin. (Karin chuckles) So, what kind of dancing would you like to learn? - Uh, I don't know, what's popular? - Well, what's popular is dancing by yourself, but that won't really work in this case, so we'll start with something simpler, okay. - No, I want to dance like everybody else. - You will dance like everyone else, but you gotta start somewhere. Come on. - Okay. - Okay. All right, put your hands up here. - Up where? - Oh, sorry. Up here. - Is something wrong? - No, nothing's wrong. Okay, now just move with me. Remember that dancing is just walking to music. Like you walk across the street, you walk across the dance floor. Relax. - Okay. - Breathe. Good. Now the first thing I want you to do is step with your right foot. Step. No, not quite. Try it again. And step. Good, bring that foot in, touch. - Okay. - Other way. Now step, touch. Keep your hands up. Step. - Okay. - Step, touch. Okay, you got that. Now, this is the important step. We go step, step, step. - Okay. - Step, step, step. Step, step, step. Keep your hands up. Keep going. Step, step, step. Step, step, step, good. Step, step, step. Step, step, step. Step, step. You're a natural. - It can't be this easy. - Oh, all right. Don't get too excited here. You're hot, mama. (Karin chuckles) - [Larry] What's the matter, no date tonight? - No, I thought I'd help out. I brought some dinner. - Oh yeah, you sure did. - Larry, Larry. - Yeah? - The order's all ready yet? - Yeah, I'm working on it. - Well, they're gonna be here in half an hour. - Hi dad. - Hi honey, where's your mom? - Uh, she went to drop off the Walden job. Um, seems like you're having trouble with the business. - Nah, nothing but the usual summer madness. - Dad, Larry told me you had to lay everyone off. - Honey. (phone ringing) Nothing you gotta worry about. I'm gonna get the phone. - Mel Nichols Printing. Yeah, no, it's on its way over. Thank you, bye. Larry, you want to watch the phones? I gotta drop off this order. - I'll come with you. - Okay, here, you take this. Bring some food, okay? All right, here I am, right here. Okay and watch the front door, too. - [Karin] Dad, how bout putting me to work at the shop? - Doing what, honey? - I, I could, there must be something I can do down there. - Sweetheart, I really appreciate the offer. - Look, dad, if you need Larry, you must need me. It's a family business. I'm part of this family. - Karin, I don't have the time to teach you what you need to know right now. My back's against the wall as it is. - Dad, you never have the time when it comes to my working there. - Oh- - Why is that? - Come on, Karin. - Dad you, you say I can anything I set my mind to. I went water skiing and hang gliding with you. - I know. - Then why can't I do this with you. - Because this is too important. - Then the other things weren't important? - Yes, they were important and I was proud of you, but this is different. Now will you wait here. I'll be back in a minute. - No. Dad, look, let me walk with you. - Karin, would you please wait for me here. It'll be faster. - My dad's fine when I'm roller skating or water skiing or hang gliding, but he can't stand it when I use my cane. My brother Larry hates me 'cause he thinks I get all the attention. I'd trade places with him in a second. I'm sorry, I don't mean to be unloading all this on you. - Karin, I want to hear it. - I'd be going crazy without you right now. - Richie dear. - Oh, hi, Mrs Macklin, how are you? - Fine, thank you. Did I ever show you my picture album. - Um, only about a thousand times, ma'am. - But your little girlfriend hasn't seen it. - No. Mrs Macklin, this is Karin. Karin, this is Mrs Macklin. She lives in the building. - Hi. - How do you do, Karin? I'm happy to know you. Ooh, ooh. Here's a picture of my granddaughter, she's eight years old. Funny name for a girl, don't you think? Jamie. - Uh, Mrs Macklin, Karin. - She's very pretty. She looks every bit like you. - Oh, do you think so? I think so, too. Look at this. These are my niece's wedding pictures. - They're great. - Yeah. (upbeat music) - Five, six, seven. Straight, back, two, three. Take a turn.

I think we should just do simpler steps because they're just as much fun as, you know. - No, listen Richie, please. Just try and figure out a way to explain it 'cause I really want to learn how to dance. Please just do this for me. Please. - All right, look.

Huh? Let's go. Here's my hand. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Two. Yes, yes! All right. You like that, huh? - You're lucky you were there. - With music, come on.

We'll talk to her together. - No, I gotta do this on my own. - Can I talk to my daughter by myself, please? - Uh, yes. - I hope you're not gonna tell me you were taking a dancing lesson all night. - No, mom, I'm sorry. - I don't like tracking you down, Karin, but your father and I were up half the night worried sick about you. - I know I should have called. - Yeah, you certainly should have. And you're lucky your father isn't here. - Why didn't you try me at Richie's? - Oh, come off it, Karin. We did try you. The line was busy all night. You obviously had it off the hook. - Mom, I said- - No matter how grown up you think you are, you have a responsibility- - Stop it! - To let us know where you are! - Stop it! I said I was sorry, okay? I should have called. It just felt good not to ask anyone permission, you know? Finally make a decision on my own. - You don't live on your own, young lady. - Well this is not gonna happen again, mom. I didn't want to tell you and dad this way, but Richie's asked me to move in with him and I'm gonna do it. Richie! - Yeah? Let's get in the car. Is that everything? - Um, there's one more bag, I'll get it. - Oh, I've got it, honey. - Oh. - Are you sure you won't change your mind? - Mom, would you try to stop me if I weren't blind? - Hello, Richie. - Sir. - Thanks. - She won't change her mind. (Mel sighs) - Karin, you really sure that this is what you want to do? - Yes. - Really? - Yes. - Don't you know how much this is hurting your mother? - Dad, what about you? Am I hurting you, too? I mean you never said anything about how you feel about my leaving. (dramatic music) - Well of course I don't want you to go. - I know. I still love you both. (dramatic music continues) - Karin. - Hi. - So this is it, huh? - Uh, yeah. Kinda good to get me outta your hair, huh? - Well, yeah, in a way. Listen Karin, I hope everything works out for you. - Thanks. Bye Larry. - You okay? - I don't know. (dramatic music continues) - Okay, sweaters here. One more bag. - Uh, it's my regular stuff. - Regular stuff. Up in the bedroom. Come with me. - Richie, you're gonna have to move things out of the way so I don't worry about falling over something every time I come in the front door. - It's no problem. Now you know, of course, that you're asking me to ruin the charm of my apartment. But I guess in this case I could make an exception. - Thanks. Keep telling me I did the right thing. - Karin, you did the wrong thing. You're the has-been girlfriend of a has-been landscape artist washed up at 19. - Disaster. - Remember, the kitchen is downstairs. The bedroom is behind you. I'm right here and I love you. - I love you. - Morning. - Morning. - Morning. - When's breakfast? - About two minutes. You know, I still think one of us should call her. - Honey, I'm sure she's fine. She'll call us if she really needs us. - Yeah, but we've been looking after her all her life. He doesn't know how to do that. - No, but she left home to make her own rules. Now how's it gonna look if we're calling her every five minutes? - Dad. - Yeah? - Um, how much longer you think you might need me down at the shop? - I gotta see how this month's receipts look. - Oh, can't get used to her not being her. I keep expecting her to walk through the door any minute. - Here. If it bothers you that much, give her a call. - See, the thing is is that the band still hasn't found a good drummer, and if I could give them, you know, just a reasonable date, they'd probably wait for me. - I can't give you a reasonable date. Believe me, the sooner things are back to normal, the happier I'm gonna be, too. - Oh, I think maybe you're right. She's gonna call us when she needs us. - Yeah. - She's not too proud. - When are you two gonna stop talking about her? You know, she has been the center of attention my entire life. Has it ever occurred to you that I might do something interesting, too? I thought it would just get a little bit better, you know, once she moved out. But she is still all you two can talk about. What do I have to do to get some attention around here? Go blind? Would that do it? - Good morning. - [Richie] Hi. - What's this? - Oh, that's so you don't take an unexpected trip. - Well that was nice. - You sleep good? - Yeah, I slept great. - [Richie] Good. - Am I mistaken, or did you clear the stairs? - No, I'm glad you noticed. - It's a lot easier to get down these stairs now. - Okay, stay on the carpet. Follow it to happiness. Hi. - Hi. - You have a good sleep, yes? - Yeah. - Come around. - Okay. - And breakfast is served, madam. - Oh, that was nice. Oh, it smells good. What is it? - Its' um, it's different. Try it. Scalpel. - I love you. - I love you, too. - Aren't you gonna eat with me? - No. I'm late for work. I got a job way out in the boonies. And I'll come home at six, we'll have dinner. You know, we'll go out or something. - No, wait, Richie. I told you I had that appointment at the rehab center about my scholarship today. You have to give me a ride. - Karin, I can't give you a ride to work. I'm late and you haven't even gotten dressed or anything. - Well how else am I gonna get there? - I don't know, take the bus. Bus stop's on the corner. - No, the center's on the other side of town. I can't just take the bus. - Okay, all right. I'll give you a ride, but can you eat a little faster or something? Here. - Yes. Yes, how's this? - Faster. Faster. Karin, I know that when this rehab counselor hears about all the things that you've done, he's gonna hand you this scholarship, no problem. - I hope so. - Look, it's all in your attitude and how you present yourself. You just be positive and don't mumble and knock over the guy's coat rack. - I know. - You can do it, baby. - I hope so. It's the only way I'm gonna get into Whitfield. I really want to go to that school, even if it is in New York. - Yeah, but it's not the only school you can get into. - No, I can go to a local college, but I'm just gonna cross that bridge when I get to it. I wonder what this rehab counselor will be like. - Probably some jerk bureaucrat who doesn't know the first thing about blind people. Like me. - Will your family be helping you with any expenses? - Um, their business is in trouble and it's gonna take all the extra money to keep it going. It's kind of a problem right now. - Karin, the rehabilitation department doesn't normally give scholarships for out of state colleges, but when they do, we have to feel confident that you're not going to give up half way through. - Yes, of course. - To be honest, Karin, there's nothing here that convinces me you can it. - No, I know I can. - So does everybody, in the beginning. - Um, I just need a chance. I've taken in all kinds of challenges before. I went ice skating and roller skating. I even went hang gliding. - And how did you manage your day to day mobility? - My brother. - Is he going to college with you? - No. My friend, Christine's, gonna be there. - And she's sighted? - No. - Then you will be totally alone for the first time in your life. Do you understand what a challenge that is? - Yes, but I've done all those other things. Don't they count? - Karin, I'm talking about the real everyday world. How can I take you seriously when you've always lived at home, your brother's taken you everywhere, and you've been totally dependent on your family for your entire life. - No, that's all changed. - Has it? Even since you moved out, you haven't looked into a guide dog or even taken a bus by yourself. I'm sorry, Karin, but can you see any reason to justify that we should take this big a risk on you? (Karin crying) - Karin? - Yes. - What happened? - Um, I didn't get the scholarship. Um, I left the rehab office and I tried to take the bus. She said I couldn't handle myself, that I couldn't make it on my own, and I told her she was wrong, and um, I got lost and confused, and I asked the bus driver to let me off and I called you. I can't do anything right. - Oh Karin, stop crying. I'll take care of you. - I want to be able to take care of myself. - Come on, come on. Let's go home, let's go home. Step. Be careful. - I want to welcome you to the daily living skills class. This is where we're going to learn to run our lives independently. Now are there any questions before we begin the class? - What about money? How do I know what's what? - You fold it different sizes for ones, fives, 10's, and so on. - What about laundry? How do you know which clothes are colored and which are white? - You have to tag all your clothes. You know you'll get all the answers to these questions as we go along. - Oh I know, I'm just curious. - And maybe a little scared. - Uh, just a little bit. - I'm sure you were all scared. Let's get on our feet and learn to love our microwave. - Sorry. - Sorry. - Um, Barbara, you know, I never realized how much I made my parents and my boyfriend do things for me. I never even learned how to make myself dinner. - Well, pretty soon you will, and without any burned fingers, Karin. - Okay. - Now, let's all get to work. (microwave dinging) (doorbell buzzing) - Who is it? - Karin, it's me. It's mom. - Mom, hi. - Hi. Can I come in? - Uh yes, of course. (microwave dinging) Uh, that's the microwave. I've got a, a stew in the microwave. - Oh. Well I just thought I'd drop by and bring you a care package of groceries. - That was nice of you. You didn't have to do that. - I know I didn't have to, I wanted to. It's a nice place, Karin. - Thank you. - Why here, let me help you put these things away. - No I got it, I can get it. Uh, how's dad and Larry? - Oh, they're fine. They're busy. Hard at work. They miss you. This coffee fresh? - Uh yeah, help yourself. - Thanks. Oh my God, Karin. You call this coffee? - Uh, sorry, I guess I'm used to the way Richie makes it. He calls it atomic. (Joan laughs) - [Joan] I can see why. - I can make you another pot if you want. - No, no, no, it's fine. How are you and Richie getting along? - Fine. Um, he's at work right now. - Do you think that the two of you might like to come over for dinner sometime next week? - Uh, I don't think I'm ready for that yet. - Okay. - Do you want to tell me what's in these cans so I can put some brail labels on them? - Look at that, yeah. - Yeah, when I finish, you know, whatever this is, this kind of makes the shopping list for me. - I see. Okay, a couple cans of green beans. - All right. - Oh, they're like little magnets. - Yeah. - And a can of sweet corn. Here's something you can feel. - Asparagus. - Yeah, your favorite. - That's really expensive. - No, not for a special occasion. - You know, I went to the market the other day, and I never realized how much food costs. Really have to budget our money. I think I blew the scholarship. - Oh, honey. Oh, I'm so sorry. What happened? - Um, they didn't think I could handle it. They felt I'd been too dependent on my family. - Well I guess that's my fault. It was so painful watching you struggle to grow up, you know? I wanted to do so much for you and I think I did too much. But, your dad and I want you to know that if you want to go to Whitfield, we'll do everything we can to help you. - Thanks. Um, I think I'm gonna go for that scholarship again, though. - I'm gonna get it this time. - Yeah, I bet you will. - Okay. - Oh. I've missed you. - I missed you, too. You know, something I need help with is the stew. It doesn't smell right. (Joan laughs) - I noticed that. - Oh, thanks. - Let's see. - Okay, it's in here. Oops. - Oh honey, where's the tomato sauce? - I don't know, did you bring me some? - Oh dear. Oh, let's see. Well you've got some. - I guess I didn't see it. - You sure you want to do this? - No, but it's my assignment. I have to take the bus by myself. - Are you getting on the bus, ma'am? - Yeah, she wants to- - Oh. I don't know. Can you take me to the blind center on Vermont? - That's no problem. I can take you to Sepulveda. And then you switch to the 45 bus, and that'll take you to Vermont. Then you catch the 61 bus and ask the driver to tell you where to get off. It shouldn't take you more than a couple of hours. - I had no idea it was so complicated. - I'm sorry. Are you getting on the bus or not? - Come on, Karin, I'll just take you. - No, yes. But I'll see you tonight. - Step. - Okay. - That band of yours find a drummer yet? - Uh, no. Not one that they're happy with. - So you could still get the job if you got time enough to get ready for the audition? - Yeah. - Would three or four days be enough? - Dad, you give me three days I'll make it enough. - All right, you got it. - Yeah? - Yeah. - All right! - Just no more practice at 7:00 AM, all right? - All right, it's a deal.

We just started talking over old times, and we used to drink a lot. I forgot, I'm sorry. - Uh-huh.

You have to go to work. - Okay, but I want a phone call at work telling me you're okay. - I said I would and I will. You have to stop worrying. - Stop worrying? Karin, don't tell me to stop worrying. I love you and you do not realize how vulnerable you are out here. - Of course I do. I just have to find a way to protect myself. - How? - I'll find a way. - You gotta turn your hips, you gotta turn your hips.

I'm really proud of you, Karin. You're really doing good. - Oh, thanks. No matter how much you flatter me though, I'm not gonna let up on you. - Okay, I'll see you Wednesday. - All right. - [Instructor] Just be careful not to scratch the floor. See you tomorrow. - Well, I guess I better watch myself around you from now on, huh? - Larry, what are you doing here? - I just stopped by to see how you're doing. - Translation? - I guess I miss you. - Well what have you been doing? - Well dad finally gave me a couple of nights off next week and I got a job. It's at the Pink & Blues Club. - That's great, Larry. That's really terrific. - Wait, what happened? What happened to your face? - I bumped into a tree. - Translation? - I got mugged. - What? - Look, don't tell mom and dad, all right? - Oh, so that explains the judo lessons. Wait, where was Richie? - He's not my keeper. - Yeah, but Karin, you can't go around roaming the streets just because you take a couple of judo lessons. - Look, can it, Larry. That's all I've heard from Richie ever since this happened. - Yeah? Well what happens if someone comes up and pushes you like that, huh? - Don't. - Huh, is that what you're gonna say? "Don't, I'm just a poor blind girl." Ooh! Ah. - It works. - Certainly does. - I'm sorry, you okay? - Yeah. Need a ride? - Um, no, Richie's picking me up. In fact, I'd better go. If I'm five minutes late he panics. - Hi baby. - Hi. - How you doing? - Sorry I'm late, Larry stopped by. - Is everything okay? - Oh yeah. - I missed you. - Yeah, I missed you, too. - I really missed you. So, you learn how to take care of yourself? Huh? - Yes. - Go see ZZ Top. - What in the hell are you doing? - Richie! - I could have been anybody sneaking up on you. - I was going to the laundry to do the wash. - Well why didn't you tell me? - You were taking a nap. - Well why the hell didn't you wake me up? - Look, the laundry is too blocks away. Every time I go out of the house I'm not gonna get mugged. Why don't you just lay off of me? - I will not lay off of you! Listen to me, I do not want you hurt ever again! - That's fine, all right, but you are not gonna be there when I go to Whitfield. - Well maybe you're not ready to go to Whitfield. - Of course I am. - Why, 'cause you can handle yourself around the apartment? It's a little different in New York, Karin. - I can handle it. - How? - I will handle it. - How are you gonna handle it with people you don't even know? - Why are you trying to tear me down? - I'm not trying to tear you down.

Yeah! Woo! Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet. Okay, let's see what the judges have said. Okay, the tension is mounting! Give me a big round of applause for the winners, which is couple number, four! Yeah! (audience applauding) - That's us, we won. - What? - We won. - Congratulations. Wait. (shushing) Congrats, you guys were terrif. What's your name? - Richie Valente, Karin Nichols. - God, I haven't seen you around before. Is this your first time? - Uh, it's not mine but it is for Karin. - Well, I hope it's not her last. She's got a little mover and shaker! (audience applauding) - Um, there's something that makes winning tonight even more special for Karin. She's had to work extra hard to learn to dance. A lot harder than anyone else because she's blind. - That's incredible. And you taught her to dance like that? - Well, I just taught her a few moves. She did all the hard work herself. - Fantastic! Let's hear it for Richie and Karin, yeah! (audience applauding) - Richie, I'm leaving you. - Slow down. Karin, will you slow down? - Why did you have to tell them I was blind? - What difference does it make if they know you're blind? - What difference does it make? We were supposed to be dancing and have a little fun, Richie. You turned the whole thing into something else. - That is not true. I just wanted them to know how proud I was of you, Karin. - No, how proud you were of yourself. I mean, for a few minutes I was dancing free. I was on my own, it felt wonderful. You had to come in and stop it. Just think about it. - Think about what? - God, you don't get it, you don't get it. - Get what? - That I am myself. I am just me! I cannot be who you want me to be! - Don't you realize how much I love you? Doesn't that count for anything? What the hell am I to you, Karin? Just another achievement? Another challenge for Karin, the blind girl? - You don't understand. - You're right, I don't understand. I don't understand you, me, us, anything! (dramatic music) Don't leave, Karin. I know we can work it out. We just need more time. - Richie, I don't have any more time. I love you, and I want you to try and understand that. Rich, please don't. Hello. - Hello, Karin. - Hi. Is mom around? - She went to pick up some stock. Are you okay? - Oh, good. You? - Surviving. - I'm gonna go now. - Oh wait, come on, Karin. What's going on? - Uh, I left Richie. - Uh-huh. - And I'm going to go to school in New York. - Did you get the scholarship? - I will. Uh, would it be all right if I moved back home? Um, just, to like reapply? It won't be for a long time. If I don't get it in a month, I'll move out. - You don't have to move out. - No, I do, for me. - Okay. - I'm gonna come back later. - No wait, honey. Why don't you wait for her here, okay? - Okay. - Here, give me this. - No. - You don't need that in here. - Yes dad, I do. It's part of me, all right? Are you afraid somebody's gonna see it or something? - There's no one else here. - Well then what is it? - What is what? - What is this thing with you and my cane? I need it, dad, I can't see. - Well, you think I don't know that? - It helps me, and with it I can help you. - Karin, you cannot help me in here. This is not school. This is not, not play, this is the real world in here. - Don't you tell me about the real world. I have been outside looking into the real world for so long! Just let me come and do it. Damn it, I'm here. Let me be in your world. Please dad, just let me help you. - Come here. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Uh, you know how to work one of these things? - Yes. - All right, now this is the top page, the middle page, and the bottom page, okay? They gotta be done half hour ago. - All right. - They, they um, give you any spending money with that scholarship? - Not much. - Well I pay five dollars an hour and all the paper you'd need. - I'll take it. - Hey Richie, there's a visitor here to see you. - I hear you're looking for somebody. - Hi. - Hi. - You look good. (Richie chuckles) - So do you. - Six weeks is a long time. - Yeah. Who's your new friend? - Oh, this is Andy. I didn't want to leave without saying goodbye. I leave for New York tomorrow. - You got the scholarship, huh? That's great, Karin, congratulations. - Thanks. - Well, I never thought I'd be jealous of a dog. - He can't dance. - Karin, I don't know what to say. - You don't have to say anything. - Don't go fall for any of those Ivy League guys, huh. - You get the first dance when I come home. Thank you. - Thank you. - Come on, Andy. (hopeful music) (dramatic music) (bright music)
