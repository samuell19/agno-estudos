How you doing, Portland? Please welcome to the stage Adam Carolla! Yeah! Oh. God, that felt good. Thank you so much, thank you so much. Love you, Portland, this is why we came to Portland. Evidently, a few homeless folks have come to Portland as well. Jesus Christ, it's tent city. Hey, I'm from L.A. We have homeless, but we don't do it in lanes on the freeway. You guys are on the freeway. I was driving here from the airport. I passed a homeless encampment right on the freeway, right on that little vagina wedge there, there's like... I just... by the way, it is one square foot of sod and someone put a tent up on it. Like, I just feel like if I carried one of those patches of grass they use at the driving range and just threw it down anywhere in Portland, some guy with a beard who smelled like jizz would just land on it and go, "I'm... I'm puttin' my stakes down here." I, uh... I had this thought, 'cause see, in L.A., the homeless guys are constantly going up and down the canyon and the boulevard and they're going up Laurel Canyon and up Coldwater Canyon, and I've seen like 130-pound homeless dude pulling a wagon train of shopping carts like 18 long, and I started thinking about it. I started thinking, like, listen, we get our asses kicked in the bobsled competition every single year in the Olympics, and it's all about the start, right? It's just this move and 15 steps, you jump in, and we get professional athletes and football players and Herschel Walker and sprinters and we always get our asses kicked by some spindly Swedes. What if we took the homeless guys and sent 'em to the Olympic Training Village. Just pulled 13 shopping carts filled with shit up a hill for a living. You don't think you could slide this tub on a sheet of ice for 14 feet? Also, just out of curiosity, in the four-man bobsled team, I know what the guy in front is doing, he's steering, and then the dude in the back, that's like the brake man. What are the two dudes in the middle doing? As far as I can tell, their entire job is run like hell, jump in, and then attempt to suck your own dick for 61 seconds. Like this, chug, chug, chug, suck, suck, suck. How'd we do? I've had this thought for a million years, and people think I'm kidding, but I'm really not. L.A. has a lot of crime, we don't have a police force, everyone is scared shitless, all the cops don't wanna get out of their cars anymore with all the Black Lives Matter shit and everything that's going on out there. They don't need Kaepernick showing up at their house and taking a knee. "Who's on the front porch?" "That's Kaepernick, he's taking a knee. Mark Geragos is with him, he's fucking pissed." "What the fuck, I just got out of my car. I didn't mean anything." The cops are scared, they're not out on the street, the crime's going through the roof, there's no police presence anymore, but we have homeless people up the wazoo. What if we just gave every homeless person a cop uniform. You could sleep with your front doors unlocked, you could leave your laptops on top of your car. It'd be the safest place and everyone would be scared shitless to commit crime. It would be a little confusing, though. It'd be like, "What's that cop doing over there?" "He's throwing up into a dumpster." I got my eyebrows waxed before the show. And the lady said, "How do you want me to shape 'em?" And I said, "I don't know, I don't have thoughts about that." And she said, "I can shape 'em any way you want," and I said, "Um... shape them so I look interested." At some point, my kids are gonna wanna share their day with me, and I wanna be ready. Uh, I've got twins, boy-girl twins, Sonny and Natalia. Cheer for one of 'em. Sonny! Sonny! I don't... Obviously, I can't say which one I love more, but he knows who he is. Look... everyone says to me, "What's it like raising a boy and a girl, twins?" I go, "Raising a girl is like raising three kids, raising my son is like raising one old cat." I literally... twice a week, you just kick a pizza under his closed door and he's... bang on it, "Good, I'm good!" "You playing Fortnite?" "Yeah, I'm playing Fortnite." "All right, good. I'll get another pizza in four days." "Yeah, we're good." "Oh, I've got some full urine jars for you to collect." "Just put 'em by the door, have the nanny collect 'em." I, uh... he's a little bit soft. He actually... My wife was doing yoga in the house and my son decided to join in and then announce yoga was too dangerous for him. And I understand, he's gonna be gay, like I get it. No, that's cool. I live in L.A. If you're not gay in high school in L.A., you're gonna get your ass kicked. My son's gonna be 17 in the hall with a bunch of bullies going, "What do you mean? I'm just tired of sucking cock, that's all! That's why... I've fucking worn out my jeans, that's why I'm not sucking cock, I'm taking a cock break. Please, I love cock." Look, he's gonna be gay, I've made my peace with it as a father, I'm moving on. I... I just hope he's a top. I just... You know, a dad can dream, right? Can't a dad dream? Let's see, so we're here in Portland. I just got out of L.A. I hate goddamn Los Angeles. I left this pint-sized airport this morning. This is Burbank Airport. The first thing you see when you walk into the terminal at the Burbank Airport is this gal. Now, anyone over 40 knows this gal and anyone under 40 may not know this dude. Uh, this is Amelia Earhart, famous lesbian aviator. Pretty much known for two things: eating pussy... and crashing airplanes. And a lot of times people say, "Not in that order." Oh, no, in that order, definitely. Definitely that order. In this particular case, for sure in that order. Uh, I'm not a nervous flyer, but walking into an airport to see a three-ton bronze statue of an aviator who's leaning against a part of her airplane that broke off upon impact does not have me brimming with confidence as I climb onto my Alaska Airline flight. Burbank Airport, why don't we just go all the way as long as we're freaking people out. Why don't we just take the metal detectors and shape them like the Twin Towers. Too soon? Now, first off, how many people, like under 40, said, "Hey, man. Oh, you're gonna pick me up at the Burbank Airport? Uh, let's see... Oh, I'll meet you by the dude leaning against the oar." And another thing I noticed when I was walking past this is the placement of the velvet rope. Now, I don't claim to be an expert in the placement of velvet rope, but if I was tasked to do this job, here would be my policy: If you can stand outside of the velvet rope and lean against whatever it's protecting, I don't care if it's a bronze lesbian or the Batmobile, you've done a piss-poor job in your placement of the velvet rope, yes? Yes! Thank you. It's 7,000 pounds worth of bronze lesbian. Do you think someone's gonna make off with it? Couple of troubled teens, commandeered Mama's minivan, they were like, "Hey, let's go down to Burbank Airport and steal a lesbian!" They got there and were like, "Oh, shit, there's a velvet rope." "What the... goddamnit, aw, shit! Let's go the park and light a bum on fire. I'm out of... I'm out of ideas!" This next thing is an L.A. thing. It drives me a little insane. This shit... This is 200 feet from where I do my podcast. I pass this goddamn manhole cover every single day when I go to work. I have to shove my wallet in my mouth so I won't swallow my tongue when I'm having a seizure... because the world's worst city employee decided to replace the manhole cover in such a fashion! How disgruntled must you be as a city employee to go, "Ah, you guys go on ahead. I'll handle the manhole cover. Let's see, we have these two bright yellow stripes that go off until the Earth curves. Fuck you, Mayor. Fucking three percent cost of living increase, kiss my balls." When I'm in charge, I'm gonna find out who did this shit. First order of business. It'd be like, "Mr. Mayor Carolla, the school system, infrastructure, taxes, homeless..." "Fuck that, I've gotta find this asshole. We're taking care of business." I'll pull some DNA off that manhole cover, I'll get this guy, we declare it a holiday, all the kids are bussed into the Staples Center, we put this guy down right where they tipoff there, and I leave two seats open for his children so they can sit front row, and we cane this motherfucker. And when I'm done, I yell, "Any questions?" I know, by the way, I've realized this is how I'm gonna die because I'm gonna wake up one night at like 4 A.M. covered with sweat and I'm just gonna yell, "I can't take it anymore!" And I'm gonna get my hoodie on and my flashlight and my pry bar and I'm gonna scurry out there in the middle of the night and get run over by a bakery truck. And my wife is gonna have to explain to my kids, "Your dad died doing what he loved. Being an asshole." Every time I see this, it makes me think of another place, which is Guantanamo Bay, and the reason it reminds me of Guantanamo Bay is Guantanamo Bay has a stenciled arrow that faces toward Mecca so that all the gents that are shacked up at Guantanamo Bay, five times a day, they know what direction to pray. So, they have an arrow, they face it east, they face it toward Mecca, and all the good folks go out on a handball court five times a day and they put down their festive beach towels, and they all pray. If I were the guard in charge of stenciling the Mecca arrow, I would have a little fun. I'd be like, "Hey, Bob, which direction is Mecca?" And he'd go, "I think it's toward the east." And I'd go, "Mm, good. Um, what direction is Vegas?" And then every day for lunch, I'd sit back eating a pulled pork sandwich, watching these assholes in their bathrobes pray to some bitch on a pole at Star Garden. Thank you. Let's make America great again. This is not Photoshopped, ladies and gentlemen. This is my mailbox, and when I say "my mailbox," I mean the mailbox down the hill from where I live. You all have your mailbox down the street. This is my mailbox. And my wife was driving me to the airport at Burbank Airport, and we stopped at the light. I said, "Pull over. Somebody drew a cock on our mailbox." And she said, "Yeah, so what?" And I said, "So what? Take a picture!" And she said, "Why?" And I said, "Just take the picture!" And she said, "How come?" And I said, "Would you take the picture of the cock on the mailbox?" And she said, "What kind of scrapbooking you into?" Now, at the time, Kimmel, Jimmy Kimmel lived up the hill right next to me. So I'm over at Kimmel's house on a football Sunday and everyone's hanging out, drinking beer, and we're having a good time. And I say, "Hey, Jimmy, when they graffiti a cock in Europe, do you think they leave it uncut?" Jimmy doesn't hesitate. Jimmy says, "No, in Europe, they draw their cocks the same way we draw our cocks." I said, "First off, who died and made you a foremost expert in European cock graffiti? Secondly, I've known you for 25 years. When did you go on the world's worst bike tour of Europe?" He said, "No, they draw 'em the same way we draw our cocks." I said, "How come? How do you know all this?" He said, "I'll tell you why. Because when a cock gets hard, the head pops out, and you don't draw soft cocks, you only draw hard cocks, so they draw 'em the same, all right?" I was like, "Holy shit, were you planning for this conversation? Was this something you'd been nursing in your head on the off chance somebody stumbles into your house and confronts you about cocks?" Oh, we had a cock-frontation, I'll tell you that right now. But I didn't give an inch. I was like... By the way, you guys know the scientific way to measure your cock? Center of the anus to just past the tip. Just past, don't get greedy. Center of the anus, no cheating. Oh, here's a sign of the apocalypse. Do you guys have this at... Couple of things, couple things, couple things. Um, okay, where to start. First off, as a city, these are on every municipal vehicle, all the street sweepers and the cop cars and the meter maids and everything else. By the way, if any of the meter maids out there don't wanna be called "meter maids" and instead would like to be called "parking enforcement personnel" and they don't like the moniker "meter maid," blow me. I have an alternative suggestion for you not being called "meter maids." You get a job that has a shred of dignity attached to it and stop fucking ruining everyone's day for a goddamn living, and then we wouldn't have to call you "meter maids," bitch. Sorry, tangent. This is on every municipal vehicle in Los Angeles, and I got this kind of thing, it's like these are tells, these are signs. When you live in a city where all the freeway signs have barbed wire around them and all the cop cars have stickers saying, "Please, don't beat the shit outta your grandparents," that's gut check time for a city. Uh, I don't know that this little swatch of vinyl has ever prevented senior abuse. It's not like someone is, like, going, "Oh, I've gotta get down to Shady Acres to open a can of whoop-ass on Nana." "What does that bumper sticker say? Wow, that's... I just took a look in the rearview mirror. I didn't like what was staring back at me." I would bet, if anything, it reminded more people to abuse seniors. Like, "Geez, what's it been? Seven weeks, Jesus Christ, yeah, no. Yeah, I'm gonna be late for work, gotta beat the shit outta my grandma. Yeah, I didn't... Thanks for the heads-up, Los Angeles." Let's just say this is an effective modality to get people to stop doing heinous things. How about some other bumper stickers? "Hey, serial rapists, knock it off!" You guys got a river out here? You guys got, what, you've got the Willamette? Yeah! Columbia. You've got two rivers. We've got one kickass river, man. Aw, man, you're wearing a cap. You into sport fishing? You like to take a ride on the back of my Sea-Doo? Or maybe you just wanna get in a houseboat and do a little easy, a little cruisin', maybe a little trollin' or something like that? Aw, man, me and my son, we were at the L.A. River the other week, pulled up a 40-pound Amberjack, man, it was... it's majestic, it really is. It's unbelievable. It's... Basically, if this is a river, my fucking toilet's a lake. "Hey, somebody shit in the lake again, Dad." Well... "Put the cover down on the lake." This is essentially a chute that takes poop to the Santa Monica Bay. It is not a river. This is the saddest tableau of all, the Easter, like... Yeah, I can see the homicide cops there like, "Well, we found your daughter's Easter basket." "It was in the 'river.'" "Well, that looks like one of her shoes. Maybe we can pull some DNA off that cigarette butt or something." I figured out why that bird... Now, I used to think, when I'd see the picture of the bird, I thought it was a heron or a crane or something or a bird that just stood that way and then I realized, oh, no, that bird's standing that way for a reason. That bird's like... "Oh, there's a syringe. That's a syringe." "That's... that's hobo shit over there and I wanna... ooh, tampon, tampon, tampon." Gross! Ah, gross, all right, I won't be gross, I'm gonna get... I... I won't get gross. I'm gonna get... I'm gonna get racially offensive here. We got any Mexicans here? Good, all right, we've got 'em here, all here. It's good, I like it. You guys, it's good, you've come a long way. You're wearing funky frames, you've got a hipster beard. Everyone's Mexican here, right? That's good, that's good. All right, you're gonna like this next one. It involves your people. Um... Now, judging by your carriage, it doesn't seem like you guys do a lot of fleeing. I feel like your fleeing days are behind you, right? Those were your formative fleeing years. But there's still a lot of folks from Mexico who like to flee, and this is another super important and expensive sign that Los Angeles has put up, because they wanna give us a little heads-up about not running over families of Mexicans. 'Cause that's what I need, I need a fucking sign, right? So if I'm pulling out of the theater tonight and I see you guys walking across the street, I'm gonna be like, "Fuck, should I run 'em over or..." "Well, how could I possibly know? There's no sign!" My thing is this: I don't need a sign to tell me not to run Mexicans over. That's... that's built in. That's built in. I don't even like Mexicans, I just... I have a high deductible. So, you know, I don't... Either way, you're not getting run over, is what I'm saying. It's kinda hardwired not to run folks over, you know, when you're driving. Much like, uh, señor abuse. See the way I brought that one around? Uh, I feel like this sign has caused more Mexican families to be run over than it has saved. Here's my logic. I figure there's some old-timers, probably got cataracts, probably been driving from like L.A. to San Diego, he's probably an old Navy guy, he's got his Oldsmobile, he's been going back and forth for 45 years, and at some point, he's cruising down the 5 freeway and he looks up and he's like, "What is that sign? Huh. I don't remember seeing that sign before. I've been driving these parts for years. What do they want... "ka-chunk. "What the hell did I just hit?" Horchata's all over the windshield. Here's how you know you people are taking over. I do that joke a few years ago and I say, "horchata," and everyone's like, "What the fuck is horchata?" Now it's like... You're taking over. Using my horchata measuring stick, you guys are kicking ass. Now... I like the sign, but it's not quite accurate. You're just bringing the one kid with ya? 'Cause I... I'm not saving for private school because you're just bringing the one. Oh, no, I... Oh, yeah. Much more realistic depiction of what's going on. And by the way, the third one? Pregnant. With twins! Oh, my favorite, my favorite is this next one, the rolling memorial. This is all over L.A. Again, I'm seeing the senior abuse things, I'm seeing the fleeing Mexicans, we've got the barbed wire around the freeway signs, and then I gotta pull up behind this asshole at the signal and then do the math, like, aw, shit, how old was that guy? 23, 24, what? And let me tell you Mexicans something. Couple things, couple things. Now, this is wildly depressing to the blue-eyed devil, number one. Number two, when my grandpa died, I didn't duct tape his urn to the roof of my BMW and circle your fucking apartment. You should know we never do a flattering math. Like, whitey never does a flattering math when we see the young guy dead on the window. Like, we don't go, like, "Oh, war hero!" We go, "Huh. Gangbanger." "Probably a mule and drug den, yeah. Tunnel collapse, yeah. Mhm." Just so you know how whitey grieves, by the way, I'll give you a page from whitey's grieving playbook. And here's how to do it. We, uh... we shed a few tears, uh, then we eat, then we talk shit about the person that's dead. That's how we grieve, you understand? We don't put a fucking mural up in the back of our truck. Also, not sure what I'm supposed to do with this information. Like we're just gonna get off the freeway and be waiting at a red light, and I'm gonna go, "Hey, man." And by the way, when are we gonna stop doing this? I've not owned a car with cranks in it in 23 years, but I still do this one. "Hey, man!" I realize we're gonna have to do this for the next thousand years, this move, like my kids are gonna be driving around in the Jetson Mobile going, "Hey, man!" Because the alternative is this: "Hey, man." "Let's go. Light's gonna change." "Carolla wants his cock sucked." "Come on, man, let's do it! Hey, don't be uptight, let's go! I've got kids in the car, too, let's do it. Let's go." So this is how it's gonna work, so I'm gonna pull up and I'm gonna go, "Hey, man." And I'm gonna lean out and go, "Hey, uh, listen, I didn't know Chuy personally, but judging from the rear window of your Ford F-150, he seemed like a hell of a cat. Please accept this floral arrangement I bought from Chuy's cousin when I was getting on the freeway. There you go, godspeed. Godspeed. Godspeed, thank you." Whew, Not Taco Bell Material, people, yeah. Uh, I figured we could give a... We could power through the wreckage of my life here one photo at a time. Uh, what's up first here? Ah, there we go. Always loved wheels, man, always loved those race cars. I miss that little jet sweeper there. That was my first car, I lost my virginity in that car. Got my first DUI in that bad boy. Eventually just wrapped it around a telephone pole and walked away. What the fuck's wrong with my parents? Look at this picture! There's a hose thrown out, there's a garden chair waiting to die, everything's dead. Could you guys stage it just a little bit? God, I wish I had two gay dads. Oh, there'd be a fucking Tahitian backdrop going on there. There's like a sock over here that's doing nothing. We, uh... we didn't do a lot of celebrating, but we took a Christmas photo. This is my fam... now, you're gonna notice that my family starts to come unraveled in the '70s. They were holding it together now. My dad's over there, he's looking like Sal Mineo with a pleather vest on. Oh, he's gonna change his look dramatically, so look forward to that. My mom's still kinda holding it together, and boy, could she cook. I mean, nobody put out a spread like my mom. You guys, with your baked potatoes and your chives and your sour cream, oh, you've never had a baked potato until you've had a plain baked potato. Making up a big kettle of air, putting out her finest mismatched china and her... her sumptuous paper napkins. I, evidently, was home that weekend from the Merchant Marines, so I... I love my grandma. You gotta... you gotta follow my grandmother's look. My grandmother looks like she should be playing keyboards for the Partridge Family. But then it dawned on me, wait a minute, she even looks more like this other dude named Austin Powers. The guy I wanna introduce you to is my grandfather, his name is Laszlo Gorog, yeah. I didn't... I didn't know any one of my... Either one of my biological grandfathers, so Laszlo was my step-grandfather. He's a Hungarian Jew, he's from Budapest, and he was a good dude, and everyone else was a scattered piece of shit. And he cooked and he took care of us and he made us goulash and paprikash and nokedli and all the good stuff, and you can see, there'll be a theme here, he and I kind of being aware that someone busted out a camera and said, "One, two, three, cheese." Look at my super passive-aggressive bitch of a mom over here. Now that's her mom taking the picture. So, Helen went, "One, two, three," and my mom went, "Fuck you, bitch." And my dad doesn't even know what to do with his face. Just look at the 2,000-yard stare that my dad has on his face. And look how in love these two are, oh. Oh, we have married couples here tonight? Well, I hate to say it, but if these two could get divorced, it could happen to any of us. Look at them, you guys gotta get a room. Come on, you kids, you're so deeply in love! Here's how goddamn depressed my family was. This is what they look like when the camera was out. This wasn't a bunch of people and their fucking iPhones shooting everything away. This was like, "Go get the case, open the case, get the batteries, wind it up. One, two, three, fuck you." Speaking of pictures, this next picture, I didn't even know... It doesn't even make sense. It's just the greatest picture ever and I have to show it to you. Um... Laszlo had a nephew. Latzi, Laszlo... Grandpa Latzi. His nephew was named Gobbi, and Gobbi yelled a lot. He was a bald dude back when bald meant scary. Remember when bald dudes were scary? Remember when guys with tattoos were scary? Remember when guys who rode hogs were scary and not just a bunch of poser pussies now? Like, "Hey, look at me, everybody. I got saddlebags with fringes." "I took the baffles out of the exhaust so I can wake up the fucking neighborhood so everyone can know I'm a douchebag every time I come home." Ugh. I hate those fuckers. This guy was a probation officer. He was bald, he was Hungarian, and he yelled a lot. So, these are his kids. That's Kim, his daughter. She looks like she just plotzed in her Underoos. Then you got his son David. David looks like he's just gonna make a run for the Mexican border, like, he's outta there. Then there's me. I am literally clutching pearls, invisible pearls. Like, I'm Scarlett O'Hara going, "Oh my goodness gracious, I have the vapors." Like, I'm reaching for pearls. Look at my sister. My sister was sitting closest to the guy who was yelling, and was completely dead. Just sawdust. My parents sucked every ounce of life out of this poor woman. She looked like she just got home from the methadone clinic. She was 10 years old and was like, "Oh, fuck life." The next picture... Now you're gonna get to see what Gobbi actually looked like. This is, this is the Gobbster over there. I told ya, bald, bald and scary. You'll see the transformation going on. This is one the front porch of the house I grew up into... grew up in. My dad has turned himself into the lead singer from Boston. Hey, what happened to Sal Mineo? Well, it's 1974, he's divorced, and he wants to talk a dumb person into sucking his dick, and the only way he's gonna do that is with that fucking look. My mom is rocking the lesbian Moe Howard look, so she was pretty much off the market. You know your life's bad as a child when your cousin Dave shows up with a Nerf football and you're like, "Where the fuck did you get that? You'll notice one thing about this house I grew up in. Two front doors, two front doors. Um... One bedroom, one bathroom. Zero hope. Two front doors. Nobody was ever sufficiently able to explain to me why we lived in a house with two front doors and one bathroom. I would've gladly traded a door for another commode to shit in, but hindsight 20/20. I used to think about the poor Jehovah's witnesses that would show up at our house. Like, uh, "Hey, just wanna share some good news. Wait a minute. We gotta put the Watchtower somewhere. What the... Shit, I'm defeated, I'm getting back on my bicycle." I give you a quick, quick shot of the inside of the house. That's the kitchen, that's the spacious and lovely kitchen. It's a galley kitchen. Galley kitchens are awesome when you're on a fucking boat. But when you're on land, they suck. The bathroom was another thing of beauty. Um, now look. I was looking at this picture and I was like, "How much caulking can you put on?" Like... at a certain point, you gotta get out a hairdryer and a box cutter and go to town, right? We can't just keep slathering on the caulking like... When your finger ain't cutting it, and you're using a flip-flop instead, that means you probably overdid it a little bit in the caulking department, yeah? I'm no caulking... oh no, wait, I am a caulking expert! And that's way too fucking much. All right, let's see. This was my school. All right, this is not summer camp for flunky hippies. This is not like extras from Billy Jack. This, this is my school. This is where I didn't learn to read and write from zero to the fifth grade. This is why I still cannot spell. This is why I can only, with confidence, spell one of the "theres." I know there's three, I stick with the one. One I can handle, the other ones, they are a Rubik's cube to me. I was trying to write the word "eulogy" the other day. Eulogy. And my phone just kept going like, "We haven't found any substitutes. Like, we don't... We don't know what you mean. Are you from this country? What's going on?" Spell-check was like going... Like it was a picture of a guy with his pockets pulled out, going, "I don't know, I... I'm a computer, I'm not a fucking magician. Like, you're spelling it Y-O-U or U-L-E. We don't know." Okay. A little theme here, little theme. That's me knowing there was a goddamn picture being taken. Once again, being aware that someone had gotten a camera out. The two folks who didn't seem to be aware that we were taking a picture are the two adults who arranged a picture. Cat Stevens over here, and Mama Cass Elliot arranged a class picture, but then decided to look the other way. I know they're probably saying to each other, "Hey, if we're gonna do this picture right we need more trash cans." Every picture needs trash cans. All right, so I thought maybe the best way to approach the rest of my life would be just to comb through my social security statement. This is every penny I've ever earned every year I earned it in. And they sent it to me one year. I just opened the mail, and it was my social security statement. It had like every year and every nickel I made at the end of the year, and I was like, "Oh my God." Like, I wept. So, I figure we can just go through it. Let me talk to my Mexican friends for a second. See, I just wanna explain for this part of the show. When you pay taxes, they give you... Hold on, let me finish... They give you a piece of paper that tells you, you know, what you pay... if you paid, you know. But don't get caught up in that, it's a fool's errand. Smart, smart, better your way, better your way. So, I thought we could just comb through the wreckage of my life a year at a time, shall we? All right, we shall start with 1980, I believe. All right, now, wait a minute. It's not fucking funny. I was in high school, I was going to North Hollywood High. I was in the tenth grade. I was working at a little out-of-the-way burger joint. I don't think they have 'em out here. They're called McDonald's. No? Yeah? You guys have 'em? I worked at McDonald's, and the reason I had to work at McDonald's is because I put in an application at the Taco Bell down the street from my house and they were like, "No." Like, "We have some standards, and you're sort of no standards, so, you're not Taco Bell material." So I got the... I got the gig at the McDonald's and I was fine. The next year, I started delivering booze for a liquor store called The Flask Liquor. I'm no math major, but you can see there, I almost doubled the amount from the previous tax year. Now, I'm in the eleventh grade, and the next year is my senior year. And that's... I'm gonna graduate in 1982. Not... yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, by this time, I'll be making $10,000 a year when I'm 150 years old. So, I'm supposed to graduate from North Hollywood High, but when I got up to the podium, they did not hand me a diploma. And I said, "Where's my diploma?" And they said, "You don't get your diploma." And I said, "Why? I passed Miss Valdivia's Spanish final." And they said, "Yeah, but you owe the bookroom $19.95 for We The People, and you don't get your diploma until you pay the bookroom." And here's how low my self esteem was, and here's how bad my family is. I was like, "So I can just leave now? I can skate out on this $19.95 bar tab I've run up at North Hollywood High and never have to pay it back?" And they're like, "Yeah, but not with a diploma." And I was like, "See ya, suckers. I'm out." Has anyone ever asked for your high school diploma? Has this ever happened like, "Hey, buddy where's your..." "Oh, shit, it's in the car, let me go... Honey, get the diploma!" No one's ever asked. This, by the way... I'll give you my ranking. I think I have my ranking here. 1.75 GPA. 497 out of 570 is not a good ranking. The only thing worse is if you're trying to set the gangbang record and you pull that number. If that's your bakery ticket in a gangbang record attempt, 497 out of 570, that's a tough draw. Be honest, gents, anyone ever seen a gangbang video where they're trying to go for the record? I don't focus on the dude who's on top of the chick. I like to look down the line about 12 or 13 dudes. You know why? 'Cause those guys are doing my favorite move, which is, "I'm sort of jacking off, but not really. I mean, shit, I got my dignity, don't I? I'm just kinda self fluffing. I'm basically doing the version of what a jogger does when he hits a red light. Like, I'm..." "I'm not, not really running. Just kinda staying loose until it's go time." My kids love that joke. Now, I get out of high school. I enter the fast-paced, lucrative world of carpet cleaning where a diploma will only slow down your progress. Oh, you'll be the source of much ridicule on the jobsite with that diploma. "Hey, hey, poindexter. Why don't you bring that giant brain over here and see if you can clean up this gravy stain?" The next year, I got into construction. I was a carpenter, just like Jesus. Except I didn't gouge the elderly. Thank you. That's me and my Honda 404 and my pussy wagon over there, because, uh, women love late '70s Japanese pickup trucks. By the way, this bathrobe was not mine. Somebody gave it to me and I didn't have a sash. So, I had to hold it shut with my hand or my balls would fall out. I literally couldn't afford a piece of terrycloth. I oftentimes wore a dress belt with this bathrobe, which was a very casual yet formal look. All right, pressing on here. Uh, '84... Yeah, you know, you feel me, right? Look at this. Now, how did I support myself on zero dollars a year? Under the table! Under the table, that's right. Ten bucks an hour. Spent one year building a kitchen onto my grandmother's house. That's the kitchen. That's my contractor saw. That' all the... I built the entire thing on my grandma's house. And at some point, I was getting near the end and I was in the kitchen one morning, and I was in there painting primer on the walls, and she comes in and she's wearing nothing but shoes, blouse, and underpants, with the big, billowy grandma bush back then, you know? Big, fluffy... grandma... pincushion of gray down there bush. And she came in, and I said, "Ah, Jesus Christ. I was planning on beating off at lunch. Like, what the... forget it now. I guess I'll just have to eat at lunch." I was like, "Come on, grandma, what's up?" And she's like, "I'm here to help." And I said, "Help, how are you gonna help?" "I wanna paint." I said, "You're gonna paint? You're in your underpants!" She says, "Yeah, so what?" I said, "Well, put some pants on. Put some painters pants on." And she said, "I'm a grandma. I have skirts with sunflowers on them, and I don't wanna get paint on my skirts, and I don't have painters pants. So I'm gonna paint in my underpants." And I said, "Fine. But for Christ's sake, stay off the ladder." I gotta beat off some time before Halley's Comet comes again. All right, this year, woo, yeah. 1986. 1986, doing earthquake rehab work for the city. $19.55 an hour and I'm rich. I'm like, "This is the greatest thing, and by the way, this party just started. Who wants a Pegasus? Who wants an eightball? I'm going out whoring. This is a rocket sled ride to the moon that's never gonna end! Never!" Shit. All right, now listen. I'm no financial planner. But I'm gonna call this a lateral move. All right, now you gotta understand, I graduated high school in '82. My 10-year reunion is coming up in '92. So, no one wants to be a loser at their 10-year reunion, right? So, I got that to look forward to. Then, I'm gonna turn 30 in 1994, and I always planned it that I'd be doing something by the time I was 30. I didn't need to be on TV or syndicated radio, anything. Writing greeting cards or anything. Anything creative. Anything but being on a construction site, because every construction site in L.A. was the same. It was 15 Mexicans and 3 racists named Mike, and I wanted the fuck off of that. All right, so I wanted out. So, keep those two dates in mind as we push forward. Oh, and by the way, hold on a second. It sucks making that little money and living in L.A. Like, I was the guy at the supermarket going, "Hey, is it just the Top Ramen? Do you have a bottom ramen or... Are you out of bottom or middle ramen? The Top Ramen's a little rich for my blood." All right, 1988. That's a zero. That can't be good. All right, let's see how the run toward the class reunion works. Aha! All right. Now, I got my truck, I got my bed box, I got my lumber rack, I got some business going, I got some jobs going, and everyone is saying to me, "Get your contractor's license and start making some real money." And I said, "I don't wanna do it." And they said, "Why not?" And I said, "If I get my contractor's license, I'm gonna end up living in Simi Valley with a fat wife and two ugly kids, and I don't wanna do that. I wanna live the dream, man." And they said, "Get it," and I said, "No. I'm not getting my contractor's license. I'm gonna pursue my dream." Woo! Now, the only problem with pulling down this kinda coin... is you don't know if the ladies love you for you... or we got a gold-digger on our hands. All right, now I'm gonna turn 30 in '94, and my reunion's in '92, and here we go... agh. I remember sitting around my apartment with no air conditioning in North Hollywood going, "When is that fucking white privilege gonna kick in? Jesus, what time is it? That shit's gotta kick in any day now, right?" I love it when some asshole from the Huffington Post gives me a fucking lecture about white privilege. Oh God, do I fucking love it. Oh, it's so great, so great. Some chick went to Yale and Cambridge and shit, and she's going, "Well, you don't know it..." Yeah, yeah, come live in my world, bitch. Jesus Christ. Thank you, White Brotherhood. All right, 10-year reunion. Oh, that was awesome, man. I went to The Old Spaghetti Factory in Van Nuys like MacArthur returning to the Philippines. "Oh, you guys said Carolla wouldn't amount to anything. Well, I think my $3,500 begs to differ with you all. Okay, ladies, how are we gonna do this whole blowjob thing? We going by height? We gonna go alphabetically? I'll tell you what, I'm gonna wait in the bathroom stall. You guys surprise me, thank you." Fucking awesome high school reunion. "Hey, Adam, how's it going?" "Not well! Not well, not well. Fucking took the bus here." But remember, I'm gonna turn 30 soon. And the plan was to always do something. Let's see how it worked. Now I'm turning 30, agh. But, three weeks before my 30th birthday, I meet this dude. That's right. We just did a Google image search and this popped up. It's a... I think he's doing... He was doing a photo shoot for a magazine. Doing a cover shoot actually for a magazine that I'd not heard of, but it's like a big hunting magazine. It's called Bear, and he... No, they love him, they love him. And he's not even a hunter. He never even hunts, and these guys just love him. So, he's on the covers all the time. He's got a better publicist than me. How do I meet Jimmy Kimmel? I am working as a boxing instructor at Bodies In Motion. I am teaching slow white people how to box at 7 A.M. I'm teaching classes in the morning, and then in the afternoons, I'm doing carpentry. And I'm driving my truck over the hill one day, and I hear the radio show. Jimmy's on KROQ morning radio. Jimmy the Sports Guy. Not Jimmy the guy who hosts the Oscars two years in a row. Just Jimmy the Sports Guy is gonna fight Michael the Maintenance Man. This is me walking Jimmy into the ring in 1994. He's wearing... He's borrowed my shorts, although I didn't tell him to pull 'em up to his fucking nipples. That was, that was his decision. This is him being punished and me being delighted. The thing that was funny is I remember in the second round, I was like cheering Jimmy on and I was like, "Hey, what's in my left hand?" I was like, "Oh, it's a mouth piece, huh." So, he did the second round with no mouth piece. The other thing... the very first joke I ever told on the radio, I remember it was about a week before the fight. Kevin and Bean called me up as his trainer. Now, I worked at a place called Bodies in Motion as a boxing trainer. I taught a 7 A.M. class and then I did carpentry all day. So, that's all I was, and that's all they knew. And they wanted to talk to not Adam Carolla. They wanted to talk to Jimmy the Sports Guy's boxing trainer. And I told my very first joke I ever told on the radio. They called in, they said, "What do you think about Jimmy?" I said, "Well, you know, we're working on a few things, and we're working on a nickname. 'Cause if you're gonna be a boxer, you gotta have a nickname, and I know he's from Brooklyn, so we're thinking maybe Brooklyn Assassin, something like that. And then he's also Italian. So we're thinking maybe something with Italian flair. Like, Italian Tornado. But after watching him spar, we just went with Jim." The judges were Adam Sandler, John Wayne Bobbitt, and Pat O'Brien. Yes, John Wayne Bobbitt. There's Sandler. John Wayne Bobbitt. John Wayne Bobbitt was a bigger star than all of us back then. He was a much bigger star than Jimmy, me. Probably tied with Pat O'Brien. I don't like John Wayne, but John Wayne Bobbitt is the guy who... he battered his wife. He was physically abusive to his wife, and in return, she cut his dick off and got in a car, and drove down a road, and threw it into a field. Absolutely. I'm sure he deserved it. Now, here's the thing. He got divorced from Lorena Bobbitt, and then he remarried, and guess who physically abused his next wife? Jimmy Kimmel. Jimmy Kimmel. That is right. Thank you, you guys have been wonderful, good night. Remember, Jimmy Kimmel's an abuser, all right. John Wayne Bobbitt put his hands on his first wife and got his dick cut off in his sleep. But that did not prevent him from assaulting his second wife, and being convicted four more times of assault for the thing that got his cock cut off for in the first place. Now, listen. I'm not a fan, but that's a guy who's focused. He's got a little something called grit. Because if I fucked up and like left the garage door open overnight, and Lynette cut my cock off, guess who wouldn't have to be asked again not to leave the garage door open? Whatever the activity is, you cut my dick off, I stop almost immediately. "Are these your socks sitting outside the hamp..." "Don't cut my dick off! I will..." Bobbitt got his dick cut off and kept doing the activity that got his dick cut off. Maybe he figured, "I already got my cock cut off once. What are the chances it would happen again?" And by the way, how pissed off would his surgeon be? Like, "What the fuck?" Like Bobbitt comes running in, there's blood all over his sweatpants, he's got a cup of milk with his cock in it. The surgeon's like, "Are you kidding me? That was fucking 11 hours of microsurgery!" I don't even know what I was talking about. Oh, Jimmy, yeah, boxing, yeah. All right, Jimmy got me into KROQ over here, and the next year, I'm now officially the richest Carolla of all time. I was like, "Shit, man." So, I told Jimmy, "That's it, man. I'm growing my beard out. I'm gonna learn to play the acoustic guitar. I'm gonna buy some land in Plentywood, Montana. And I'm gonna fuck runaways. I'm starting a cult with all this cash." And he's like, "No, stay with it." I stayed with it, and the next year, I met Dr. Drew and pow! I didn't even know they had that digit. I thought it just went to five digits. Once you got to five nines it just rolled around to zero again. I didn't know they had that one. I went on a "kiss my ass" tour of North Hollywood that lasted almost nine months. "Did we go to high school..." "Kiss my ass! I'm a rich man!" Well, the next year came around, and more money rolled in. And then the next year came around and... And it was this point I thought to myself, I thought... I started thinking about old grandpa. Laszlo Gorog, Latzi Gorog. I said, "That guy loved me, was a good dude, and he's getting old now." Now he was in his nineties, and his health was failing, and I thought, "He's gonna die not knowing what I do for a living," because no one in my family knew what I was doing. They didn't have basic cable. Bad sign financially when you can't afford something that starts with the word "basic." "Hey, Mom, how about some basic..." "That's too rich for my blood." So, my... I go to my grandfather. I go down the hill, I go to his house. He's laying down, he's getting real old, and I say, "Hey, Grandpa," he says, "Yeah?" I said, "I don't know if you know this, but I'm rich." He said, "Rich, what are you talking about?" I said, "I'm in show business, I'm making a lot of money. Radio, TV, I'm doing all kinds of stuff and I'm doing good, I'm doing good for myself. Don't worry about me, I've made it." And he said, "Really, you're rich?" And I said, "Yeah, I'm rich, I make a ton of money." And he said, "Do you make a million dollars a year?" I said, "No, you old fuck, I don't make a million dollars a year." He did what the Jews do so well. They use your own personal momentum against you. That's what the Jews do. He gave me the Jew Jitsu. Took my personal momentum, and threw me on the ground, and choked me out with my own Well, the next year rolled around. Oh, yeah. Oh, yes, I did. I had such great affection for this man who molded my childhood, and loved me when no one else would, and cooked for me, and took care of me, and I had such great affection and love and admiration for this man that I realized, I gotta run down and rub this shit in his face before he dies. So, I go down to his house, and he's laying there, and he's getting real old now. And I said, "You know, Grandpa," he said, "Yeah." I said, "Remember last year I was telling you I made a lot of money?" And he said, "Yeah." I said, "Well, you wanna know if I made a million dollars?" And he said, "Yeah." I said, "Well, guess what. This year I made over a million dollars!" And he paused, and he looked up at me, and he said, "Money doesn't buy happiness." Yeah! Thank you, Portland! Thank you so much for coming out. Thank you! You guys have been wonderful. Thank you so much.
