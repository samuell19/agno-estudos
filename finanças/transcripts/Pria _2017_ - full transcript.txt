Patience, mom. Sir, we apologize for our tardiness. Are you our officiator? Yes, I'm Haji Jaelani. I'll be officiating the ceremony. They've been waiting for awhile. Please do come in quickly. Yes, yes, thank you, sir! Apologies everyone! We're very sorry for being late, Mr. Fausi... Gita... Friends and family, please come in! Please do make yourselves at home! Let's all thank the grace of God... ...for providing us with this joyous day, full of much anticipation... ...especially for the family members of the groom and also for Mr Fausi.

We will plan to conduct the wedding ceremony... ...for you... too... Now! These are photos I took... when I was on a trip in New York about Lima, five years ago. A question. Can anyone... -you can use your "altamus"- "Tamus". Sinonim... for "cadum"... "Building". Anyone? Yeah, Aris. It's skyscraper? Yeah, good! Ok... Can we spell it? "Skyscraper"... See you all tomorrow. Can you give the pictures on the desk, please? - Mr. Beard? - Yeah? Can I keep these books? Of course. - Okay. Thank you. - Okay. - Aris? - Yeah? Hi. Hi. - Can I see your photo? - Okay. This is my favourite photo, so... just look after it. I'll see you tomorrow. What's up, mom? Why so serious, Aris... They just gave us a crap ton of homework today. What's going on? I'd like you to... ...draw. Okay, I'm gonna continue with my stuff. Stop harassing me... ...or they'll never get done. Come, let me take a look at you. Your hair is getting way too long... ...especially the sides. We'll ask the barber to come and cut it, okay? For your big day next week... Okay? It's pouring quite hard, sir. There's a scripture study tonight at my guest house. If it's not raining too hard, you will be there, right? I'll try my best, sir. I have to help my mom first. Oh... Your neck looks very weak. Do you ever exercise? I try to, sir... at home... I try to. Okay, we will definitely find time to exercise with me. It has to be taut. I'll see you later, okay? - Morning! - Morning, sir! Morning! Morning, Mister! Your main responsibility is to make your wife happy. Do you know the key to a successful marriage? It's right here... The horse's tail... The horse's hair. Do you know how to use it? Here, take a few strands and slowly wrap it. Your "thing" right here has to be taut. Can't be too soft. And remember... The most important thing before inserting... ...is this. Your "thing" has to be... ...hard! Hard! Now, touch it. Touch it! Come on! Come on! Great! Like a real man! Gita? You're okay right? I'm fine... Are you sure? Yeah... This horse hair stinks. So, your dad ordered me to come over here. Oh... You didn't come here by choice? Just now inside your house, I felt that something's not right. What do you mean? Yeah, there was a very nasty "stench" that just wasn't normal. Oh yeah! That's the smell of the horse hair! Oh, I guarantee that's not it. So then? You. What, mom? What else do you want? Aren't you satisfied? I just want to talk to you. This is your chance. What chance? What are you on about? You're going to have a family. And I'm going to be suddenly happy? Is that what you think? That easy? I'm sure. I'm so sure this is the answer. You don't know what I'm feeling. I know... I know this whole thing is very hard for you. But you're... Did you see what they did to me? They humiliated me. - This will make everything better. - Red rice again? You're really insane. Try it! Mom! - Try it, Aris! - Stop, please! Aris? Can I come in? Yeah. Thank you. I like your hair. - This place is mixed up. - Yeah! I'm sorry. I will clean it. So... What's going on? I don't want to get married. Ok... ok... Please... MAN Subtitles ripped by Leonnos (2019)
