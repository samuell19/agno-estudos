After a relatively quick court hearing Daniel Amos is moving to his final location, having appealed and lost three previous attempts to change his sentence. This comes as no surprise to those who have been following this case over the last 16 months. As you will recall, Amos was responsible for the deaths of 11 people. The states highest body count in nearly 42 years. When asked for clarification on his next move, Amos' attorney declined to comm. He is scheduled to receive the lethal injection on the 27th of this month. Live with breaking news coverag. You're dead anyw! There he is! Smoke any granni? I'll cut you goo! I got a rope for! Yeah he just a Greenie that's what he is! Hey can I borrowe when they're done with it? Right before the bulls do it to you first! I'll keep you company. Okay back up.

Your sentence end with your heart stopping too? I'm sorry. If I had it my way, I'd have 'em do it tonight, I s. Hey I'm Daniel. Amos. Maybe you've heard of me. If you've been in here long eno, maybe you haven't. Hey, can you hear me man? Hey pal. Hey! Hello?! You gotta be kidding me. This is solitary, you done put me in jail with a deaf man?

Hey man I'm talking to you! Lights out! Hey brother. You scared? I am. Still at it huh? Let me guess, you don't sleep, you don't talk, you're just the. DANIEL V.O. - So this is how it's gonna be huh? Sitting here, counting down the, the minutes, the seconds. It's torture. The heartbeat thumping in my eas are the only way I can keep time in a place like this. 60 beats a minute. As I get closer to the day it'le like speeding up time, 80 beats. 100, 200, 'til eventually. That's it, time runs out. Hey buddy you know what time it? Not that it matters but, it matters. Can you at least look at me? You can do that much friend. Please? Come on please man. Don't do this, just talk to me. Hey. Come on I don't ask for much. Just, just talk to me please. I need you. Both your names are Biblical. Did you know that? I'm guessing a felon like you d. The name Daniel translates to God is my judge. Amos means bearer of burden. It's a little ironic don't you? A man sentenced to prison and d. Almost like it was your destiny. Oh I get it. This meditation helps you forget about what's gonna happe? What can I say? The only one who could ever rea, was the son of a preacher man. Nice tats. Must have gone through something pretty profound to take on ink like that. I got these the first time I was put away. What are you? You some kind of Bible thumper that found his way to Jesus beh? Pretty cliche don't you think? But those tattoos last forever. Just like the mark we all leave on this world no matter how stupid or ugly. What's your story? Where's your mark? You a little young to spend time in Auschwitz. No, that's an old girlfriend's phone number. Let the one with understanding calculate the number of the beat for that is the number of a man! And his number is... [laughinge 440-944-1... I can't read the rest if you co. You funny man. You know you quote the Bible like a kid I used to know. Except he didn't know nothing about the Bible. But he could tell you every epie of Star Trek word for word. Well if you expecting to get beamed up out of here and get yourself off the hook, I got some bad news for you sun. Yeah I know rap. What's your name. People in here just call me F. You new too. I guess this is the last stop for the lot of us. Halfway house to hell huh? Well, it's gonna be over soon. At least we don't have to spends sitting like some low lives hav. Man there are 18 states that t have the death penalty. I could of told you this was a dumb place to commit a crime. Yeah thanks your eminence. Where was you when I was about to down 11 people? The same place as I am now. Right. Now what? You slept through breakfast. Not a lot of sleeping happening back here now. Well, well, well, Sleeping Be. Finally awake. You know when I see a perp sleep as soundly as I just watched you sleep, I just know he's guilty. You know why? I think this place gives you a sense of relief. Now an innocent man, oh I watchp he tosses and turns all night l. He fidgets, why? Because he's wondering why they're gonna kill him for something he didn't do. Yeah I had my time to come tos with what happened out there. Really? I would think that that would give you nightmares. Somebody's signing in for you n. Who? The only person allowed to visit you back here. What, my attorney? Who do you think? Your eggs are getting cold. Hey. You want seconds? Mmm mmm! I'll pass. Oh Fish, you got a date for when you che? No date. Just an eternity of waiting to e how this all turns out. Yeah, my time in court was nog short of swift justice. They got me in here on death ro. For my protection of course. Keeping me safe while they waiting to kill me. It's like a Three Stooges bid. Man, a lot of people want me de. Why they got you in the hole? 'Cause they think I'm dangero. Are you? Yeah. Everyone in the cage is an anim. I'll let you know when I need. I didn't expect to see you so soon. You got dibs on my appeal? They're still waiting to see if they accept it. Listen, in the event that this doesn't go your way, there's an issue with your execution that we, my firm thinks that you need to know about. What's to know? I get a shot, I go to sleep, and I never wake up. No, it isn't like putting dow. You might wanna sit down for th. Back in January of 2011 the State Department of Criminal Ju, they changed the drugs they used for lethal injections. They changed it from sodium thil to pentobarbital. Now, unfortunately the pharmaceutical company that manufactures this pentobar, their distributors are telling them they are gonna deny the drug to any US ps who carry out the death penalty using lethal injection. At the same time, the state, they've run out of this pentoba. Meaning? Meaning the injection formula that you're gonna get is a combination of Midazolam and hydromorphone. And this matters to me why? It matters because the last guy they put down with this cocktail, took him 25 minutes to die. The effect on the body of this combination of drugs, it's controversial and potentia. 25 minutes can be an eternity. My firm believes that's the equt of human experimentation. This is what they're gonna use on me? 'Til it's reverse by the cour. And that's not gonna happen before my time comes? It could take years to repeal. That's right. So you're not here to help me. You're just here to let me know what to expect when it happens. It's our obligation to let yo. Yeah I'd rather you didn't. By law, if there's anything you wanna ask me, anything you need. Whether it's help filling out yr last will and testament or get you spiritual counsel, they have to accommodate. Is there anything you need? You alright? Yeah. Just peachy. I really am sorry about this. I'll let you know how the appea. Hey, wait! You think if I want to look up some of this information I could get internet access bac? The internet in here? No. Well sometimes they allow inmates to have some limited computer access for comg with their relatives through em, but going online that is, you know, surfing the web, that's prohibited in just about every prison both state and federal. Just about? They don't want inmates carrying out illegal activities inside these walls. Look, I might be dead by your next bowling night. What possible harm could I cause by looking up some medical info? I will ask, I will see what t. What harm can it do right? I can't guarantee anything. Alright? But in your case maybe they'll make an exception because of all this. Please. Try. I will. If I do you know that you're gonna be monitored? 24/7, you're gonna have very limited access. Yeah, I get it. I'm only concerned about by fin. I've accepted my sentence. That's what it comes down to. I just need to know how to make it go smoother. I get it. May God have mercy on you. May God have mercy on you. If God had mercy on you, wouldn't you be outside these walls right now? I don't believe in none of that either way. I'm here 'cause of my own doing. Yep, didn't you day right nowe to find Christ, behind bars. Or what did you say earlier? Cliche? Well you just live a criminal le right up until the moment you gt and then you find Jesus to save! Man I can't save nothing righ! The balls in his court now. For real. There's not gonna be no parole, the governor hates me! Ain't gonna be no last minute p. Ain't nobody outside these walls championing for my life! Except for my court appointed s! I just gotta know it's gonna en. You know that's there a lot of girls out there that love 'em some convicts. You might wanna find one and see if she'll protest your. Any weirdo outside of here looking for a friend on death row, needs help themselves. This coming from a guy looking for a friend on death row. Mmm. You know a lot of people before us took matters into their own hands to avoid their sentence. What you talking about? What do I mean? I mean there's more than one wat beamed up off this planet. Man I'm not hanging myself! That's what you mean? I'm not saying you should do. That's not who I am. No, you're afraid you're gonna go to hell if you kill yourself. Yeah if you believe in hell ya believe in heaven right? If you believe in heaven then ya believe in God right? I don't believe in anything. I believe you. Come on man, don't look so glum. You know there's states that still have hangings? Firing squads, gas chambers, they still have the electric ch. I'd say a shot in the arm is getting off pretty easy. I just wasted my life. Man, wasting your life. That assumes you were here for some greater purpose. There's people who believe thate lucky to even be here. The fact that you were born with a heartbeat is a miracle! Science teaches us that every lg thing on this earth is only here by a highly unlikely set of coincidences and accidents. I wasn't put on this planet to die in prison. Put on this planet. That assumes there's some great. No, the more prevailing thoughts is one of happenstance. A series of cosmic anomalies that created life. Became man. Says the guy who bears the syl of a man who preached just the. You know earlier I said you muse gone through something pretty po take on ink like that. You must of gone through something far worse to go against it. You got me all figured out don't you friend? Hey, Superstar! Front and center. Your mouthpiece. I mean, he talked m allowing internet back here. Who are you? Warden Dallas. This is my castle you're living. You'll be allowed one battery charge a day. Make it count. Thank you. Why? I reviewed your jacket. I've witnessed far more sinisten leave my gates when they've done their time. The reason they got back into sy was because it was their ruling. You won't. You know I'm waiting for an appeal right? All these years I've never sen step away from a death sentence. Pray. Miracle. My figure, a little distraction might make your final week a little less taxing. Now you'll be limited to the links you can access. Now we're gonna monitor every search engine you go onto through the main computer in the guard room. So, Superstar, keep it clean. My boys around here don't need anymore distractions. Seek. And you shall find. Hey. Superstar! What could you possibly find ong 'at'll help you cross over without incident? I don't know. Maybe if I'm on an empty stomach or something it'll take quicker. I don't know, that's why I'm lo. I just wanna see what the last guy did and do the opposite. Wait, what do you mean? You said crossing over. If you're a non-believer where d I be crossing over to? It's just an expression. You really believe that we'rel here just by an accident? Well what do you think? If there is a God or in fact a, why is there so much bad stuff happening to good people? Why would He let His son be exe? Having all the power in the wor, except the will to act upon it. What were the names of the drt they used for the lethal inject? Don't ask me. You're the one with the ability to find the truth. I'll bet you 10 bucks that he types escape from jail t search engine within the first two minutes. I'll take that bet. Yeah? Alright, get the money ready. You wasting your time. This connection is blocking the exact stuff I'm trying to look up. Man, if it takes six minutes e or six hours, in the end what's it really matter? When you exist on this earth, death does not. When death exists, you do not. Come...! What's the point if I can't even use the thing?! I can't imagine why they woult a convicted murderer to have acs to stuff that kills people. What'd you say? Oh nothing important. It's just why worry. What's it matter. Name me one thing in your life that got better because you worried about it. So sure that nothing's after this life huh? Do you see evidence to prove me otherwise? Yeah I'm looking at you. You must of believed in eternal life at some point. That's before I realized the Jesus Christ myth was based on Hercules. Hercules? Or more specifically Dionysus, Osiris, Attis. Who? They're all God like figures of Greek mythology. They all predate Jesus of Nazar. They all have a resurrection st, and they all died excruciating. I never heard that before. Ah it's just an old story reh, handed down through antiquity. Time and time again. If everybody knows that then why is it not common knowl? Because most people only hear what they wanna hear. I was like you once. Searching for answers. But, now thanks I know the trut. Truth is you're just a guy onw whose preacherman father forced his faith on you. A lot of good that did you. Hey! Don't take my word for it, look it up for yourself Einstei! I'm sure the Bible and Greek mythology ain't gonna be blocked off for some knuckled who's gonna take the deep six! It's either that, or going backo staring at a blank page or a bl! Well why should I care either! It depends, you wanna just believe that that's the end when you die? Or do you wanna believe in some fantastical, this beautiful salvation everla? And all you have to do is hit ys and say I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah. I don't know. I thought they didn't let criminals in heaven anyway? Yeah there's always the penit. Did you say something? Your theory was wrong. What theory? Greek mythology. Couldn't have served as the insn for the resurrection of Jesus. And why is that? Greek God's like Adonis were way before Jesus' time. Yeah, but what if I'm reading was accurate, there are only four accounts ths was raised from the dead. The earliest being from the 2nd century AD. Looks like you had it backwards Why don't you look up Attis. Yeah, I already did. Says here, the earliest evidenct isn't found until the 3rd centu. Well then Osiris, as a religion that definitely predates Christianity. Mmm hmm, but there's no resurrection in that story. That's because you're only reg the written material. Before writing we had mythic ims found on ancient reliefs and po. These stories were all handed dn by word of mouth. Yeah but there's no evidence of a resurrected God to have influenced the story ofs before the 2nd century. That's a couple hundred years t. What you're reading is wrong! If the story of Christ were tru, wouldn't everyone recognize it? Hey hey, don't shoot the mess. Don't have no three headed dog in this fight. Why is there so much found on the internet and so little of it true? Every theory a distraction. It's just like the Shroud of Tu. Just another old relic used to sustain a belief. You so sure you heard the rigo that made you lose your way? Maybe what you believe is wrong. It wasn't what I found about, it's what happened to me that me me who I am today. What happened? Where did it all go wrong? I woke up one day and I saw the world as it truly. That's what happened. You see the world these days. It thrives on one lie told after another. Yeah if truth and honesty wer, would either of us be here? Who cares anyway. It's funny isn't it? Something as small as a little d just flap its wings and fly on out of here. Yeah. What I wouldn't give to have wi. You were talking in your sleep last night. Didn't sound good either. Just reliving my past I guess. Sounded like regret to me. What happened out there man, co. I got greedy. That happens to all of us man. I wasn't a total loser either. Man I had a job. I was working a senior care fac. I was, you know, mopping floors and changing sheets. Watching people reach the end of their days. It didn't pay much but it was s. Jobs usually don't. You don't know how many times I saw folks file in there only to die and ld things that they cherished. They'd have wedding rings and retirement watches and money. You didn't take those poor peoples money did ya? It wasn't like anybody was gonna miss it! And the real crime would have bo just let it sit there right? Yeah. Uh huh. Man don't look at me like tha. It's not like I took the medica. I could have took that and sold it but I didn't. I knew people needed that to li, so I'm not a maniac. Man, they don't put you on dew for swapping rings and watches. They do for taking lives. I started a fire just to distract the night guard so I could get like four or fivs just to get in and get out. The fire got out of control. Before I knew it, the place went up like a tinder box. Night shift was completely over. They couldn't get everybody out in time so, so 11 people died. Three from the smoke and the rest got burned. But I got the gold. Look I'm saying man, they ain't nobody outside this wall fighting for me. Well that sounds all accident. They putting you down for that? I panicked. I ran. I could have gone in and helped some people. I could have gone in and saved! But I didn't. I'll never get that back. What do you think that guard right there would do if I just started climbing this fence right now? I think he'd take your guilt. One round at a time! You're not gonna do it are ya? No, that'd be stupid as what I did to get in here. No, I think there's something I still need to do before this is all over. Oh yeah, like what? I don't know man. I don't know. Times up. Hey, that Shroud of Turin thing, I looked it up. I think that's real. This thing right? The supposed burial cloth of Je. Yup, just another momento to give people hope. They declared that a medieval f. Said some artist painted that. Actually they didn't. IN the 70's they tested it. They said there were no signs of any ink, paint, or dye. Just an image faded slightly into the top fibers. Said that to this day they don't know how it got there. You said no paint? No, just blood. Male human blood. There were people carbon dating this thing in the 1980's. They said it was no older than! That would make it a fake! Says here it was the outside r that they carbon tested. It was a medieval repair woven into the edge. Expert says it was that patchwork that they tested. Wait experts, you can't rely on someones opinion. This is an artifact that a lot e hang their religious beliefs on! Man I'm gonna need some scientis before I believe that it's olde. Or that it's real. Yeah, check this out. The Hungarian pray manuscript. Wait, a Hungarian what? This is a picture of what Jess actually looked like in the shr. So? Look at these pictures. The one on the right is the rea. And on the left is a drawing. And the holes match. Whoever drew this must have seen the real Shroud of Turin. And? These marks are holes found in the real shroud. This is a picture of the real Shroud of Turin. Man what's your point? My point is, the pray manuscript is from 1191. That's way older than the carbo. Alright, alright, so the dating was a bit off! Check this out. In the Gospel there were two clothes linked to his death. The shroud and the facial cloth which they wrapped around his fr they took him off the cross. I got it I got it. They call it the Sudarium of Oviedo. Look you can see it's much bloo. And what's this have to do with the shroud? Look when you overlay 'em. It lines up like a fingerprint. Blood patterns on the shroud and face match. Both of these were on the same e at the same time. This cloth has been in Oviedo Spain since 616. That proves the carbon dating w. Science got it wrong. Man that don't prove a thing. That's still 600 years after the man supposedly died. Then there's this one last th. The cloth from Turin Italy and the one from Oviedo Spain both contain traces of pollen in their fibers that are from a plant exclusive. And found within a 50 mile radius of Jerusalem. That does not make it fact. That does not associate it with the crucifixion of Christ! It could be anyone's shroud! People didn't save their shro. What about the scourge marks and the blood on the forehead, hands, and the feet? The wound on the side. That's unique to the Passion. If I had evidence of my innocence as strong as this, I wouldn't be in jail right now. Well, the jury's still out on. You don't find this at all in? What? That Atheists keep arguing thn that inspired a religion of more than two billion people is phony. And the more I keep looking int, the more evidence I find that h. You're finding Jesus behind b. I told you! Nah it's not like that but, it occupies my mind. Otherwise I just be sitting here staring at you waiting to die. I'll give you something to do then Sherlock since you're so good at looking. Why don't you tell me why it tog for somebody to write about Jes! Earliest estimate say it's half a century later, doesn't that strike you as a little bit odd? I mean how reliable could that! Relax dude. I'm not here to argue with you. Maybe you should go do some yoga and lighten up. Okay Superstar. What is this? Don't get excited. He's just here to check your blood pressure and take your temperature. Now every inmate that has a ticket to ride, that's in his jacket. Just wanna prove you're alive. Before you need to prove I'm. Give me your right arm please. You a doctor? I do work here for my elective medical residency. You gonna be the one that... Shh. Hey I'm asking you a question, you gonna be the one? Afraid not. Lean in please. So who does that honor go to? In some states, the guards do, in others, it's the inmates job. You gotta be kidding. What do ya mean, they don't have a doctor do it? Doctors are subjected to cens, so some states are trying to trn either inmates or guards to do. You're lucky. You'll have no track marks so id be easier to find a vein. Should I be worried about how long it's gonna take to die? If you need to worry about an, worry about waking up during th. What'd you say? Warden. Seriously? Is he telling the truth, that can happen? You can wake up, that can happe! Warden! What you can wake up?! Warden! Hey man I'm talking to you! Warden, what happens to my body after I die! Warden, Warden! Man, waking up mid-execution. Phew, that is a brutal one. Stop it. Eh your body will end up in a state owned graveyard somewhere. What? Either that or your ashes aree spread into the weeds out back unceremoniously... Shut up! I'm not talking to you right no! You wanted to know. Oh you wanted to know. I didn't wanna hear it! No, you only wanted to hear that everything was gonna be alright. I don't know what I wanna hea. I'll tell you what you wanna. You wanna hear that after you d, you're gonna get a clean slate. Become the spirit you were meant to be right? Most people nowadays, the acceps nothing after this. Heaven, paradise. Whatever you wanna call it. It's being discredited as a man made invention to keep people on the straight and narrow... Please. I mean, if the populatt scared to death of going to Hele world would be in prison right now wouldn't it? That's enough, that's enough! Wouldn't it? Oh! You know you were wrong right? You were mentioning how late its that people started recording the life of Jesus. Not this again. It wasn't as late as you thin. These scholars say that these stories started to show up... Not stories, the Gospels. Yeah, those. They said popular belief is thay were written decades later. Like 40 to 60 years after by this guy named Mark for one. But it seems he was just passinn what he heard from these other. Like this guy named Paul. And Paul started to preach about the Christ like 25 years after the cross. Only 25 years? Just a quarter century later. And it seems he had gotten what he learned from these other guys, Peter, John, and James. John, James, these stories change from each telling. Who knows where this came from. This could be about King Tut for all we know! No Paul preached. He said, "I give you what I was" Meaning? Meaning that he got the wordsy from these other guys! Not guys, apostles. These guys were the firsthand account of Jesus. They knew him! They saw him rise from the dead. They say that the guy James, that's supposed to be Jesus' br. I didn't even know he had a bro. He had brothers and sisters. Yeah it's amazing! I never heard this stuff in det. They say now they can trace it o one or two years after the cros. That's unbelievalble! That's like 2,000 years. That's insane! Yeah but what they're talkingt is a paranormal world! Miracles, death, resurrection. It reads like an ancient comic! As a child he was born of a vir. Come on. You believe in Alexander The? Of course, he was a real man. No one disputes that. Man earliest accounts we have of Alexander say that he was born of a virgir and had a Greek God for a fathe. And we don't hear those storiesl 300 or 450 years after his deat. So how come it's okay to believe and not the other? I know what you're doing. I see it, it's all good. You know that to avoid your fate to believe in a miracle. You know that's the only way out of this situation you're in. Belief in miracle. Right? Other people believe in miracles, how come I can't? 'Cause! You're street smart! Deep down, you know it's all made up right? Walking on water, raising the d, making a blind man see! Water into wine?! It's Harry Potter of his day is? Fewer and fewer people buy into this stuff anymore. The world's gotten too smart. Or you mean too cynical. Tomato tomato. You just believe in the truth. Believing in much fairy tales won't do you any good, I can promise you that. Hanging in there? No I'm not hanging in here. You know what I meant. I see you got your laptop. Yeah, thanks for that. Helping you find some kind of? It's definitely opening my mi. You here to give me some good n? We'll see, I'm gonna sit down with the judge tomorrow, hopefully we can try to make him see it our way. Get you another appeal. That's something, right? Yeah. What? There's a writer who wants to do an interview with you. Do a story on somebody who might be facing their final days. And they need my permission be they let them back here? That's part of it. But they also would like to inte to get a legal perspective. Now I didn't say yes until you - In other words you wanna get your face in the paper. It doesn't hurt to expand the. A little publicity never hurt r? Thoughtful of you to ask firs. Who knows, maybe one day theye a book about this thing. Yeah I'm sure I'll pick up a. You gonna be gone. He's gonna be collecting royalties off your death. Yeah, the hits keep coming. Alright look, I gotta go. Next time I show up here, hopefully I'll have a good word about that final appeal huh? Typical parasite. It's ironic isn't it? You gotta die to become the subject of a book. Let me ask you something. Before the fire, were you ever a good thief? Man I couldn't steal my mama'. Ain't nothing for free. Some things are. If you know where to look. That's the trick isn't it? Knowing where to look. Oh. That's too bad. What was that? Nothing, nothing. Hey you awake? I need to ask you something. It better be good. You said there's no life after this world right? So say the masses. But you can't prove that can? You know that there's people that have been there? They've seen it. You found near death experien. A lot of what they describe, matches what I'm reading here in the Bible. Oh they can't prove it either. That's the trick of it all. Then why did the study of 100f near death cases, half of them saw themselves from outside their body. Just before reaching the edge o. Only to be brought back before crossing over. It doesn't make sense. People on drugs have had the same experience. I'm sure they thought it was ma. What about all the proven case people have died on the table only to come back to describe ts that they couldn't possibly kno? Or the people blind since birth, that upon dying had visions of s they couldn't possibly have see? Books my friend, books. Just like the money your attorns gonna make off your wonderful s. People will write anything for k if they think some suckers willing to buy it. I might believe that but, in order to get in that book clb you gotta die and come back. That's a pretty exclusive club. You ever think that all this comes from a distressed mind? Why do you keep doing that?! Every time I raise the possibile you gotta drag me back down aga! Look, just because you lost youh doesn't mean you're right! What if there's something to al? And what if there's not? Times have changed. People are losing their religio. Spirituality. What's the difference? If you believed that God holds you to a higher standard, as articulated in the Bible, well then you're religious. But if you believe those standards hinder your life, then you might be spiritual. So you might pray to a cow as od to an invisible man in the sky. And that difference is why peope turn away from God all the time. I just thought that if no one had an answer one way or another by now then t it'd never be solved. So why question it? That makes you agnostic. You just don't know what to bel. Yeah but now, looking through the eyes of a dead man, I don't know what to believe. Make up your mind! You know the difference between fact and fiction. I don't wanna see someone on tht sway your opinion unless you can prove it to yourself! Why do you even care? Because I've been there. I know what it's like to believe in something, to have hope. To believe in the people that ae around you are true and just. Only to have them disappoint and let you down time and time. This prison's full of it. You okay an interview? Yeah. You want me to stay? No it's okay, thank you. Now don't get too close. And if you need anything, I'm right outside the door. They didn't say you'd be a wo. Is that a problem for you? No. I just hadn't seen one in a whi. What would you like to know? You look healthier than I thought you would. Do they take good care of you I? No better than the state pen. Is that good or bad or... It isn't good, it isn't bad. How's the food? About what you'd expect. But you didn't come here to ask me questions that you already know the answe. So go ahead. Alright. How do you feel knowing you're? Well there's a possibility th. I'm still waiting on an appeal. So you don't think you deserve your sentence? I didn't cause suffering for suffering's sake. It just happened that way. It just happened. You should try telling that to e who burned in their beds that it just happened. Look at my trial, I said I was sorry, I meant it. And that makes it better? What kind of interview is thi? Are you, are you evil or are you sick in the head? Evil is a choice. Sickness is the absence of choice and I ain't neither. Do you have any idea the damae done to those families? You got a question about life behind bars, then ask it. Okay. How do you feel knowing people g to enjoy watching you die? I guess it'll bring some closure to some people. Closure. And that's supposed to make it. That's not what I said. But, if I die then maybe that'lp ease the pain that I caused. You know, 2014 was the worst r for capital punishment by lethal injection. What? Yeah, prisoners they died ter. Yeah. I heard about a guy who took 25s for him to die. 25 minutes? In Arizona, there was one guy who lasted from 1:57 until 4:39. He was gasping for air like a fish out of water over 600 times before his heart. And this one guy in Oklahoma, he said that his whole body was, he was screaming. Yeah body burning, yeah I kno. And there was another guy who they took his IV catheter and they shoved it so hard it wt right through his vein and right into his groin. And they injected him into his e instead of his blood stream. The guards tried to stop it but they couldn't and he was just writhing in agony for hours. Why you telling me this for?! Because, my grandmother was one of your victims. And I just want you to burn in. Get out of here! Get out! Guards! Get her out of here! Get her out of there. Now, come on. - Guards! - Burn in hell. Guards come and get he! - Die a humane death - Guards! - but it won't be. - This ain't no interview! Burn in hell. She's not a reporter! It's not gonna be humane! She's crazy! It's not gonna be... Get out of her! It's not, you're going to be in so much pain you animal! I want you to know that! Like I told you, people falter and disappoint, time and time again. Open six I got a stringer! Oh no no no, not on my watch! You idiot! Gotcha gotcha. Why would you go and do something like this? You know why. Every one of you guys in here put a rope around your neck, you're gonna put us out of a jo. It's all about you isn't it? Just because you messed up yoe doesn't mean I have to let you mess up mine. I ever catch you trying something like that again I'm gonna bust you... That's enough! That's enough. Come on. What are you doing? Daniel, you know this would never be the right way out. You know how I know that? These last few days I've been looking at the same thing you've been looking at. I've been learning everything you've been learning. Now you know you can't focus on. Not this. You gotta think about what's ne. It's better. Here. Get some sleep. Close six. Are you that anxious to have a near death experience? I wasn't aiming for near. Well, I guess that's one way to look for God. I thought you said there wasn't one? Hence look, not find. He's back at it. Hey! Why are you so delighted sitting over there? I'm just looking at stuff. What stuff? Stuff about science and scientists don't want you to kn. Here we go again. You know science is defined as the systematic knowledge of the physical material world gained through observation and experimentation. Observation, to observe. Observation of what? I was reading about natural s. Darwin! The man with all the answers. It's interesting. You know they call it the theory of evolution. And not the fact of evolution. Oh don't tell me you don't believe in evolution because you read somebody's opit the world started 10,000 years! No, not at all. But just the same reason that yu don't believe in evolution becae catchy sitcom about the Bing Bag explains it at the beginning of every show. I just find it odd that in schol it's taught as absolute fact. But more and more scientists toe having problems with it. Darwin himself had problems with his own conclusion. What? Every thinking man accepts that life started from a single cell. And then branched out like a tre to become all modern born animals that we see today. Not every. Don't tell me you don't believe in evolution! Do certain fish lose their eyt when adapting to a cave so dark they don't need to see? Of course. But for countless species to wie with no common ancestor? That's a completely different thing altogether. You know about this? The Cambrian explosion? Please. Enlighten me. Okay according to Darwin, all the different lifeforms camy of evolving from one common anc. That's what we just discussed. The issue Darwin found with the Cambrian explosion is that all these major differences in lifeforms appeared overnight in evolution. There's no fossil record to shot they descended from an immediat. So a laptop makes you an inte? Look, for Darwin's theory to, it would require new forms to ee in tiny gradual changes over long periods of time. Yeah, listen to this. If it could be demonstrated that any complex organism existd which could not possibly have bd by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely brea. Those are Darwin's own words ma. A century after he wrote this, there's still no observable proof that true evolution ever occurred. If you start talking about intelligent design I am out of here! Darwin knew about the gap. He was hoping that fossils would eventually show up to prove him right. And?! They never did. Well maybe those other lifeforms are too soft or small to fossilize! Then why do we have fossils of pre-Cambrian sponge embryos? Man they're soft, they're small. I don't know! I'm not a geologist! Neither am I! But it's interesting that sciend a gap in evolution but you won't hear about that in science clas. Yeah well they don't have to g for the missing link, he's standing right in front of me. I'm not standing here because of some undirected process. I'm beginning to think that we're here for a reason. Yeah, we're in jail because of natural selection. The lethal injection prevents our descendants from doing the same. You see how that works? But the two dominant lifeforms on this planet, plants and animals. Plants are here to offer food an for intelligent man. But intelligent man offers no benefit to those plants. It's like it was designed that. You are reaching. Explain this to me. How do you get life from non-li? How can you just get something out of nothing? I don't know! Maybe lightening struck a pile f ooze and some gas and whammo we have life?! Man with all we know about bi, chemistry, physics, we can't replicate that or prove that. We can't even account for the dy between you and the Ebola virus. Between a cactus and a butterfl. So how did all that come from one spark of life Dr. Fran? Why do we have inner species br? Alligators and crocodiles can't. Humans and apes can't. Lions and tigers can, horses and donkeys too. They share a common genus. But when they do, their offspring is sterile. Tell me that's not intentional. If it's all just evolution, what started it? If it's just life trying to betf through necessity then why do we free thought or the ability to? What survival instinct drove us to appreciate da Vinci or Mozart? What necessity forced us to impe and evolve and ask the question, why are we here? There is no reason. Unless someone put us here to a. If our DNA is encoded like a cor then who is the programmer? I'm sorry. Is there anything I can do? I'm sorry. Wait! Will you be there? Would you like me to? Yeah. You did your best on my behalf, it'd be nice to have at least one in my corner. There will be. It was a long shot anyway. Now what? Now I pray. I thought we talked about thi. I thought you accepted that there is no one to pray to? That's what you decided. I don't believe that to be true. You said something about us beie by a series of cosmic anomalies that created life and became ma. Yeah, have you ever seen God? No. But you can't see the air eithe. But when the wind blows on a grd you know it's there. So maybe the mysteries of the universe are like that? Just God's fingerprints hidden in plain sight. That's your proof? That's what you're going on? What's your proof that he's n? 'Cause some people find religion in a textbook instead of the Bi? Well, are you saying that scientists aren't smart? 'Cause there's some wise peopleV who know about the cosmos, who might challenge you on that. There's a difference between being smart and being wise. A smart man knows that a tomato is a fruit. But a wise man knows not to puta tomato into a fruit salad. Ahhh, I know that every atom y they're made up of stars. Everybody knows that. So that's the end of the story. I didn't say they didn't. But who created the stars? Look if you're gonna put everytg into the hands of celebrity atheist scientists, then let me ask you something. There's 100 billion galaxies oue Countless planets and stars. Next time you're in the yard, I want you to pick up a handful. Ask yourself, where did all that matter come from? Think of all the gases, all the, imagine the water on our own pl, the power of our sun. Look in one second it produces y that keeps us alive than mankind has ever produced. And in our own Milky Way there's that are 1500 times the radius. So where did all that come from! The Big Bang! 13 billion years ago. Okay but I'll say it again. Something doesn't come from not. What caused the Big Bang? If the universe didn't exist ban it had no reason to exist at al. So?! So for it to exist something o cause it to exist. What caused it to exist? If there's a reason for the Bigg then who was the Big Banger? I don't know, maybe the univee created itself. That's not observable science. Look we know that the universe is expanding. That the galaxies are moving. That the earth is spinning arou. That the moon is traveling around the earth. Nothing moves without a reason. So what was the immovable object that started it all in motion? You've been reading Thomas Aquinas haven't you?! If something is caused it hade caused by something else. That's your science! You're causing me to have a h. It's funny huh? When it comes to the important, it takes as much faith to believe in a Darwin or a Big Bang as it does to believe in a creator. Well, well, well. Ain't you precious. You found God in jail after all? It seems to be the most obvious observable answer to all these questions. But you won't hear a peep about that in public school. But you might in prison. So that's it? Made your decision. Yeah! I found enough holes, poked ints of non-believers that I have no other choice but to believe in God. Well. Clock just about done. Time on this earth's not eterna. I wish you'd see it. You're right. But I now believe that in the ee when every bit of energy in thec universe has died out, as every living thing must do. When the last star fades and the light goes out forever, it'll be then that the echoing s of every living thing that's evn will ask the question, what was it all for? Why did something so great exist only to fade like a dying thoug? Then what will the answer be? For the man whose soul belief is in science, there will be no answer. But for the man of faith, he already knows. Here's the meal you ordered. My last supper. You know most people request something special for their last meal. I'm no different. Get your. I thought this would go good with your last supper. Mums the word. Thank you. Would you like some? Today is the day. Today is the day of al. You scared? Not as much as before. I wanna thank you. For what? You know why. Open six! How was that meal son? You gotta put these on. You okay? Yeah I'm alright. We have a spiritual adviser o. Do you want to talk to him? No. I think I found what I was look. Thanks to Fish. It's time. It is almost time. What? This is your face? Only the face you needed to s. Why didn't you just tell me? Why challenge me on everything? Because no one could force yo. You needed to find this on your. Why me? Why not you? The one question you asked, I never got an answer. Why would God allow his son to be executed having all the power in the word except the will to act upon it. Yes. You know the answer. He did it for love. To pardon the sins of all mankid so that we may be forgiven and live again with the Lord. Daniel, it's time. You got th! Keep your! Keep your. Are there any last words you wish to say son? I'm sorry for everything. And I'm sorry I didn't see the promise sooner. Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom. Are you gonna do it? I thought this moment would br with another new believer. Thank you Daniel. Amen, I say unto you. Today, you will be with me in p. You know your name's Biblical?
