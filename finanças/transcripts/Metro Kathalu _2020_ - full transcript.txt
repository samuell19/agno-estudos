Frankly speaking, i did not understand a single word in that mail, except the last line asking me to marry you. That's the reason i told you to get me a print out, did you get it ? Yeah i got it but tell me something, why is it so difficult to understand this ? [Smiles] I can't read or write in Telugu, i opted for Hindi while in school. We used to stay in Rourkela when i was a kid. Oh okay So should i be reading this out to you now ? It's so embarassing, isn't this why i mailed it to you ? [ Crickets Chirping ] Am curious about what you wrote in it. Relax and read it, we will talk later. We need a place to sit and talk...shall we have coffee ? Okay. Dear Abhirami, I love you the way you are, I love your smile. I have been observing you since 4 years and am in love with you since 2 years. I want to be with you every second i breathe. Twinkle in your eyes makes me to stare into your eyes forever I dream of waking up next to you everyday... i want to grow old with you. [ Smiles Shyly ] I told about my decision to my parents even before discussing it with you. If you are okay with these..i want to make you my life partner . [ Smiles ] Sounds nice. Why don't you try as a poet ? Stop pulling my leg Abhi, these are my feelings that i have for you. So...do you like me ..... Will you marry me ? I like you....it's your decision which has to be finalised . Are you kidding ? I love you which is why i proposed you, isn't it ? [ Sighs ] Have coffee...i will talk about it. [ cutlery clanking ] So, tell me... [ Sighs ] We hail from Amalapuram My father just had basic education.. He works as grade 4 employee in Rourkela We had a small coconut orchard in our hometown. We lost it because of Hurricane. And that's when we shifted to Rourkela. Even after me and my brother was born my father's income was just 1800rs . I don't know if you can understand how difficult it would be to run a family of four with that salary... He used to work over time so that he can send us to good schools and get us well edcuated. He used to get paid 15Rs. for an hour He worked extra 5 -6 hours a day He developed acidity because of that . When he used to return from work, we didn't use to have delicious food to satisfy his hunger pangs. My mom was helpless too, she used to cook with whatever we had in the house. My father used to get angry .. He used to throw away the plates... He used to hit my mom very badly.... and used to cry after a while. My mom also used to cry [ Wipes Tears ] We went through so many such rough nights... My father will be retiring next month.. He earns 42,000 Rs. now..he bought a flat in Hyderabad, my brother pays EMI for it. All we want from him is to retire happily, cook and eat whatever they want and be happy with my mom. The reason i am telling you all these is, after we get married ..i will spend my money for you and our kids.... ..at the same time, i will spend my money for my parents too. Most important thing is.... My debit card will be with me. Now you should be telling me...do you like this or not ? As i mentioned , I am from a middle class family... ...all my life i wanted to study well and get a good paying job. I was mostly on scholarships based on my merit , i never went on any Picnics or Tours. Travelling from Rourkela to Amalapuram was a big deal for us. - Can i get one more coffee, please ? - Sure, Ma'am. So..after i got a job, all i wanted was to roam around the world. If you noticed me..you should have seen that sometime I come to office with a backpack on Friday. Weekend i keep going around places. I visit places around Hyderabad. I visited Karnataka, Maharashtra and many more. I will travel even after getting married. So it's your turn to tell me if you like it or not. [ Man ] Ma'am here is your coffee. I love Coffee.... Shall i tell you something else ? That's okay...I don't want to hear anythingelse. Oh..i should tell you this thing too. When i was in Grade 10, there was this boy who liked me He expressed his feelings when we were in Grade 12. He was a smart and intelligent boy. we were together for about 6 months after he proposed me. He kissed me once....It felt good at that moment... we broke up after that .... Now i can't even recognise him. I was never in a relationship after that . Do you have anything else to say ? I mean any more terms and conditions ? - Excuse me, Bill please. -Sure Ma'am. I have nothing else to say. All i want to say is, I don't see a reason to say no to you. You are a nice, well behaved person. As i mentioned how much i want to care and respect my parents in future, i would like to know about your parents too and would sincerely try to respect and care them too. I will also make sure my family would respect you too. Also, I don't have any underlying medical conditions..all i have is minor eyesight, which i think wouldn't be much issue. So i think our journey together will be a good one. I think my libido is good too [ Smiles ] Hold on...let me pay for this. Let's go. I think we will make a good couple. I hope we will grow together successfully in terms of Society and Career. Am sure we can educate poor kids and help them in having a good life. I can see all these in you. So think about it. Will you be able to put up with all these ? Can you make your parents understand all these and handle them ? Think about it, if you would be able to handle all these or not . I think we can do this. Thank you for this. My first love letter with a decent proposal. Shall we leave ? - Hold on .. - what is it ? [ bells ringing ] You told me about the boy who kissed you when you were in Grade 12... Where did he kiss you ? [ laughs ] Talk to your parents first and find out if they are okay with whatever i told you....afterthat i will tell you where he kissed me. Bye... see you tomorrow. ♫♫ Ghatana [ Man ] Tell me Baby.... Sorry i missed your call. Movie was so boring....i wish you were next to me .... I miss you so much, Babe. All our weekend plans were cancelled only because of you... [ Sighs ] Anyways...how's the trip going ? [ Giggles ] So...are you having fun ? Good..... looks like you are enjoying leaving me alone here. Hey...watch out.. [ Tires screeching ] [ people talking ] [ Footsteps approaching ] [ tires screeching ] [engine halts ] [ car door opens ] [ Woman ] Excuse me, Can you tell me which room is Patient Satyanarayana in ? [ Nurse ] Please wait Ma'am. [ Man] Ma'am i am the one who called you. Are you the one who did this accident ? [ Nods ] [ Slaps ] Can't you watch out while driving, You bastard . - Ma'am please listen to me... - Where is Satyanarayana ? He is in Emergency ward Ma'am. It's that way. Ma'am please listen to me once... Ma'am..... [ Door opens and closes ] He is on that corner bed Ma'am. [ Sighs ] [ Man ] Don't worry Madam, it's a small injury. Nothing to worry. They took him for a CT scan. Can't you guys let me live in peace ? Such a terrible family this is....Drunken bastards. Why doesn't he understand and divorce me ? [ Monitor beeps ] We know that you would be worried and did not wanted to tell you . That man called you, it is a minor injury . Who is that asshole who has been selling drinks at such an odd hour in the night ? Why don't guys just leave me alone ? [ Nurse ] Please stop yelling and using flithy language. This is a hospital . [Man] Sorry [ Breathes heavily ] [ Sighs ] Don't worry, Sister. We are sorry. I tried to stop him . He did not listen and had too many drinks today. There was a small issue with new business venture a small fight took place in the afternoon. [ footsteps receding ] What really happened ? what happened was.... Ma'am they were fully drunk and not in senses. I tried my best to avoid the hit but i couldn't do it because of them. You should have hit him hard to death. It would all have been done for once and ever. Atleast i wouldn't have to face this hell everyday . Let me explain.... Shut up...don't say a word. Why the hell were you roaming on the roads this time of the night ? Oh wait, what ?? what the hell ? I was just trying to help out. These people did not want me to inform you but still i did . Look Keshava Rao, I am fed up with all these. It's time i get rid of all these. I don't want him in my life anymore. I and my daughter will be happy without him. Incase he comes out alive of this situation, i am not going to let him into the house. I can't accept him anymore. You and your brother can do whatever you want. Good bye. [ weeping ] Ma'am..... Ma'am.....you are under tremendous stress and you will not be able to drive safely in such a situation. Please come inside and sit for a while. Just shut up... I will not come inside. Do you think i can get a taxi here ? I don't think you can get a taxi at this time . Shall i drop you ? Where do you stay ? Kondapur. That's okay. I'll manage myself. You go ahead . Don't worry, it's not a big deal. It's on my way ...let me drop you. Give me a minute.. [ Runs towards the vehicle ] [ engine halts ] Ma'am.... Ma'am.... You still look angry and restless . Please think once again.... I feel you should have stayed back in the hospital . [ cries ] I hate men... I hate him . I hate escapists . Not all business ventures will be successfull, so what ? Is that the end of life ? Things don't always happen the way we want them to be . Shouldn't we fight against out failures ? People look down upon us, they will hate us, ignore us..so what ? We tend to fall sick ..fall down, so what ? Shouldn't we fight back ? How can you leave your family behind and run away for years and years ? How can you escape like that ? Life is a struggle. That should be enjoyed too. A person who cannot enjoy struggles cannot do anything in life. Such people are better off dead. Such kind of people ...such bastards ... they weaken themselves.. they weaken the family...they weaken others...they weaken the entire planet. I should do something about this. They will harass me till my death. I am struggling to stay alive. Being with a person like this for 20 years... [ engine halts ] [ Door opens and shuts ] Ma'am.... - You shouldn't have done like that ? - like what ? I mean...you shouldn't have left your husband like that in the hospital . You came to drop me , right...just get lost . Instead of fleeing from the scene, i took them to the hospital...You are his wife... I am asking you to leave...just get lost -please understand Ma'am... - Just leave, Bastard What the hell ? Can't you talk nicely to people ? Forget about me...he is your husband....Don't you have minimum respect towards him ? [ breathing heavily ] [ dogs barking distantly ] He is my aunt's son. He was my first friend, lover and now my husband. He is like the bad luck in my life. Okay..He might be wrong, he might have done mistakes. So, won't you support him ?Atleast have some humanity towards.... I don't have patience to argue with you. I am sorry. Please leave . [ sighs ] It's okay . I understand this is your personal issue. I am too tired. I didn't have my dinner too. I skipped it while waiting at hospital and waiting for his treatment. I was returning home for Inorbit mall and got struck in this. I am very hungry and i don't think i can get to eat anything at this hour. Can you make some coffee for me please ? [ clock chimes ] Thank you . Ma'am...please listen to me once They need you there. That old man can't handle all this alone. Though your husband is out of danger, he will need to stay in the hospital for 5-6 days. Nothing to worry about him, but i am unable to see you like this, in such a restless situation. I am little worried about you. I can't leave you like this, go home and sleep peacefully. Please calm down . [ breathing heavily ] I am unable to take this anymore. I am fed up and too tired to fight. I don't have the energy to fight with men around me at home, office, neighbourhood. This is a fight i have to go through the day and at night.... i am tired fighting against the women inside me longing for a touch . [ weeps ] Ma'am....please control Ma'am. [ cries loudly ] Ma'am... Ma'am... Ma'am.....please... Ma'am...please control yourself Ma'am...please [ wails ] Ma'am... Ma'am...things will be okay...please calm down. Ma'am...

How many days would it take to get the reports, doctor ? There's nothing to worry, this is common now a days. It's just like fever. There are so many people who survived this and are happy. We will meet next week. You will be fine. Don't worry . Can't we have the reports earlier. I am very tensed to wait for a week There's nothing to be tensed about. Reports will be coming from Mumbai, so will take time. Do you have any health issues like BP, Sugar ? I was diagonised with BP 8 months ago, am taking medicines for that . okay Bring your husband along next time, let us discuss in detail. He....he works in Bangalore. And you ? I work with the Income Tax department. How many kids do you have ? We don't have kids. Since how many years have you been married ? Did you think it's early to have kids ? - It's been 4 years - okay It's not that we did not wanted kids..it's just that pregnancy didn't happen. Do you have any fertlitiy issues like PCOD ? No.... We both stay in different cities.. Our's is a love marriage He is very much career oriented...he is always hopping from city to city He shifts to wherever he gets better package and better position. Earlier he used to visit me every weekend, then he started coming twice a month and then monthly ...now a days he rarely visits me. He comes whenever he gets free time and he prefers to meet his friends when he is here. It's all like a chaos..... I don't know somehow kids didn't happen to us. [ sighs ] We even stopped talking about having kids . Am sorry to ask personal things...Is he into extra-marital affair or something ? I don't know...i don't think he has any affair.... I don't know he might be having, am not sure. See, technically speaking cancer is a physical disease, however all diseases occur from brain. Talk to your husband. Don't neglect this. ♫♫♫ [ phone rings ] Hello, tell me.... Looks like you are so busy that you don't even pick my calls. I have been meaning to tell you something since morning.... yeah, tell me.... My company is starting a new branch in Gauhati okay... Guess what i got promoted, they are sending me there as branch head.

Hello.... hello.... [ vehicles honking ] [ door opens ] [ Turns on the lights ] [ sighs ] [ breathes heavily] [ cries out loud ] ♫♫♫♫ [ phone rings ] ♫♫♫ [ sighs ] [ phone rings ] ♫♫♫ [ phone rings ] [ Breathing heavily ] ♫♫♫ [ cries ] [ Phone rings ] [ camera clicks ] [ cries loudly ] [ Phone rings ] Hello ... Why aren't you answering calls and what's that selfie ? So strange....were you missing me? Since when did you start this new habit ? Hello..... Why are you quiet ? Next week is our Anniversary, so to keep you reminded.... [ laughs loudly over the phone ] You have become very naughty [ Phone rings ] Hey...what happened ? What happened ? I sense something wrong ...what happened ? Surpriya, what happened ? - I might have cancer .. - what ? Results will come in a week . Why didn't you tell me before ? Don't get worried. It's very common itseems. 1 day for surgery and 2 days of hospitalisation and i will be back on feet. There is no need for bedrest too. Why did you get Cancer ? How would i know ? Do you know why animals don't get diseases like BP, Sugar just like we have ? They act acoording to Nature. Mating, reproduction happens according to the nature. Animals don't have career goals...comparisons. Female and Male animals don't live in seperate jungles. So, nothing new happens in their system. Listen to me Surpriya....let's consult another doctor...let's take a second opinion. Remember, before marriage in our courtship days....you used to sit next to me and talk to me every alternate day. I guess i wouldn't have got cancer, if that continued. If you would have held me closely...i probably wouldn't have got this, i guess. I wouldn't have probably got this...had you kissed me frequently . Supriya...i am coming there. Relax, don't worry..i can manage this. Please don't waste your leaves for me. Let me complete...listen to me and understand.... I will leave all this and come there forever no.. what's wrong with you..i am telling you i will come - i said no [ Man crying over the phone ] Don't cry.... I said you don't need to come...stop crying. Tell me something.....

Looks like it's about to rain...let's go [Man] Did you sit properly? [ Bike starts ] [ motor whirring] [ Sirens ] Yesterday Dileep's wife called me, today is their daughter's birthday itseems. She called to invite us. His parents came from hometown for the birthday. She invited us to come with family. Shall we go ? I can't come, i have work...You guys go to the party. What work do you have on Sunday? They called you twice yesterday Because you didn't answer them ..they called me. They invited us...let's go, please. I told you, i have work...you guys go ahead. Dileep's father wants to meet you . What i don't understand is...you will always be ready to go out anywhere except here. What is the issue here ? You are overthinking about this. Dileep called me yesterday and told about his parents too. I am really busy , you guys go ahead. [ Vehicles honking ] Dileep's father likes you a lot. You two get along well with each other. Instead of sitting at home and watching those stupid daily soaps on TV, we can go to their house and have fun. It's sunday anyway. We can go with kids and have fun. Please let's go.

Baba, i don't even like the smell of these. Why did yo get them again ? [ sighs ] Eat them Your father usually doesn't remember if i ask him to get something but he remembers to buy these palm sprouts the moment he sees them. And he irritates us to eat them. We have to go the party in the evening....go and sleep for sometime now. ♫♫♫ Mom...remember, we told Dad to take us to KFC. Every wednesday they have offers too. Forget about KFC, there is a very nice party in the evening... your dad doesn't want to come. go and convince him. okay [ prayers chanting over speakers ] - You want these ? -No Why don't you join us for the party ?

You don't remember anything else ? No Dad. - But you should remember, isn't it ? - what should we remember ? You and your mom don't remember anything but I remember everything. If you want ask me anything about food except about today morning's breakfast..i will tell you everything. - we ate kova - the one you got last time. - is it ? - yeah Okay say Kova then....ready...1..2..3 [ both kids ]Kova Kova.... When i hear this word...i remember Vanajamma, who used to bring us milk when we were kids. She was as thin as a pencil lead. [ all laugh ] She used to have milk and sell all day but never drank that milk. She was very stingy. In the mornings she used to sell raw milk for a bit higher price and evenings she used to boil the leftover milk and sell it for a cheaper price. My mom....your grandmother who did not have much money used to buy the boiled milk in the evening. One day Vanajamma forced her to buy the excess milk she had for lower price. My mom took advantage of this situation and got 2 lts milk for just 1 Rs. 50paise. She took it for throw away price. - she took it for such less money ? - you wait...you continue dad You know what my mom did with that milk.... She called me, my brother and sisters and made us sit near the stove. She boiled the milk slowly and adding sugar little by little she made yummy Kova from it for that night. We had dried coconut shells which were used for cooking ...she cleaned them and gave us Kova in them, little by little to all four of us. That night we slowly ate that yummy Kova fearing that it would be finished...we ate till we fell asleep. Whenever i hear Kova...that's what i would remember. - are you done ? -yeah - Ask me anything else I will ask you this time. Apple ? Apple is very costly. We never used to have apples in our house. I used to have a mud piggy bank and used to save money my mom or relatives gave me ,in that. On Dec 31st i used to break it and buy an apple with that money on Jan 1st early morning.. I used to get that apple wrapped in in a pink paper and tie it with a thread. I used to make my sister write in the card with her beautiful handwriting. I used to take that apple , card and give it to my favourite teacher Rama devi, wish her a happy new year. She used to wish me back, take me closer like this and used to caress me. Once she gave me a dictionary...that's still with me. So whenever i see apple or eat it...all i remember is my Teacher Rama devi. [ laughs] You can me anything else if you want - i will ask - this time i will ask you [ sighs ] ask me Sweety, pass them to me please. Tell me, what do you remember when you see these palm sprouts ? Come on ! tell us the story behind why you keep buying them whenever you see them. palm sprouts....They remind me of my father, Salma. My father is from a village. The never had Pizza and burgers like now. So all they had was seasonal fruits to eat Mango, Guava, Black Jamun..Muntamamidi.. what is Muntamamidi ? Cashew fruit Oh okay But he used to love these palm sprouts since his childhood He always used to cry for them when he was a kid itseems...Once they stopped buying just to make him get rid of that habit . Do you what your grandfather did then ? -what did he do ? He stealed a penny from his father's pocket A penny was a huge amount at that time...he got scared and wrapped that penny in a paper, kept it on the attic and did not sleep the entire night itseems. With that penny, he bought palm sprouts and ate entire week itseems. [ all laugh ] My father used to tell us this story and make us all laugh..even after we grew up...he used to buy whenever he saw Palm sprouts, bring them home and made us eat them Since then i started liking them....it's not that i like them personally...i like them because my father liked them I always had a dream that after i grow up, i will earn a lot of money..buy so many Palm sprouts and make my father eat them Did you buy him Palm sprouts then..after you grew up ? He isn't alive anymore He went to god when i was studying in school and never came back. He left us even before seeing us settle down in marriage and careers One afternoon, he came home...threw his bag aside washed his legs and sat down in a chair... He died just like that sitting on that chair After that someone saw in the bag and told us that he had Palm sprouts in that bag ... My father loved me a lot... When he loved me so much... i wonder how much he would have loved you guys if he was alive... If he was alive and saw that i shout at you at time ...i guess he would have yelled at me [ cries] i never listen to anyone...isn't it ? Not even your mom's But i used to listen to him....I always thought if there was a situation where he would yell at me for shouting on you guys.... i thought i would go inside and hide behind your mother I thought about many things like that ... ...Now i have Palm roots but i don't have my father to eat them [ cries loudly ] How was the Party? Did the kids enjoy it? I now understand why wouldn't come to Dileep's house Dileep's father reminds you of your own father, isn't it ? Isn't this why you did not come to their house Get Palm sprouts tomorrow...i will eat them too. Bring them daily..okay [Both smile ] ♫♫♫ THE END
