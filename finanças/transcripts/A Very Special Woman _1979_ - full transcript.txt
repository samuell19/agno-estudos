A VERY SPECIAL WOMAN Don't worry, Francois. I will do better than Jasmin. Jasmin is smart. He will manage to cross any border. And if they get hold of her? But you ? Don't worry about it anymore. Consider Jasmin's drug addiction. He will manage. Everything is okay. Thank you. It goes hand in hand with hashish. We will make 500 million old francs. 500 million old francs? I get in too. You can get more hash and 800 kilograms of heroin? I have to ask my friends first. - Okay. See you soon. Hi ! Here you were! Hi ! The hash is in the bag. I'm glad to see you ! Hi Jasmin. - Nice to see you, Francois. One day the customs officers will strip me in the bare ass, at least with the look. You will get what you deserve. Look at this. Here it is. What was Stanley talking about? Heroine. 500 million old francs. 2. 3 00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,720 It would be better not to get involved in such a thing! I think I live a pleasant life. I like. To get my hands on 500 million... risk-free. You do not want ? Tell me how to do this. Jasmin... - What's up with Jasmin? Instead of hashish, heroin will pass. Not. - What you said ? Not ? Remember the organization. You got it ? It is not as easy as you think. - You should know me better. Hashish is a pleasant pastime. Heroin will destroy you. Don't get involved in this. - You think so ? No, Jasmine. Don't do that. Heroin is very bad for you. No one can help you. In six months you will look 20 years older. I know many women who have done this. Finished women. You are talking nonsense! 500 million old francs. Are you not interested? You're kidding. Hashish means money. They are dead after him. They only want hash, nothing else. It's like a dream for them. See you later. Are you feeling better now? Supervise it! - Leave the jealousy aside. You know you're the only person he wants to have sex with. You are small, my dear. Nice of you to be here. - What happened ? Any problem ? tell me Tell me... Problems? - Yes. I don't have any vials left. - Are you out of ampoules? Do you want to kill me? I want to know the truth. tell me What to do ? We don't really have any reserves left. All our goods were confiscated by the police. But if you could take a trip yourself... for another group... You can take the last flight. And you will have the goods. Why would I do that? Why don't we both go? Far away. Let's look at the sky. And what should we do? Shall we drink rainwater? What should we live for? I think I made enough money. I made some money. But I want more. A lot more. For me and for you. For both. I love you. I want to feel good. OK. Agree. I will fly. - Stanley's offer is extraordinary. What is it ? Merchandise? tell me I don't know for sure. I think it should be some kind of hashish. Something special. Let's go to the room. - We can do this together. Four of us. - Will be fine. It's weird like Jasmin he trusts you. He really believes in you. It's worth playing this game for 500 million. Fuck ! My passport. If I knew where it could be. Of course... at home. It is so wonderful. Your goods... Your money 500 million... You can take them from the bottom of the ocean. You and this damn whore. It seems you've known her for a while. But you should have known her better. She is a bad girl. There is no one here who did not have sex with her. You're a bastard, Francois. For you... For me... For both of us. Sounds very good, little one. But you don't really know me yet, Francois. Fantastic. Can't you drive otherwise? Drive back. come on Move. All the tourists went crazy. come on Drive your car. OK. i'm trying Kick it. Oh no. What a sound. Impossible. An orchestra. I like the great classics. Fantastic. come on I will push the car. Give it gas. Fuck. Are you crazy? - Yes. I went crazy. Leaves ! Don't talk to me like that. The same is true for you. You bastard. Stop talking. OK. Let me drive your car. I just need a minute. come on Let me in. Watch me drive. Who gave you your driving license? Stop it! What are these ? Drugs. Can't you do that somewhere else? Not true. He has a lot more in his bag. I'm going crazy. - Give them to me. Not ! Don't do that! Can I help you with something ? Hey! What are you doing ? What got into you? - You are a big bastard! Your wife is missing. You should have been smarter. What this means ? are you crazy Very easy. I get a million dollars from you. I will call Jasmin and she will come back. As do dogs. Of course he will be back. With flowers and fish Idiot. What do you want to say ? - One of my men saw his car on the fence. She met a man who was waiting for her there. He took her by the arm and led her to him in the boat. Romantic, isn't it. The temples. You were hot and you raped her. Go away. Calm down. Enough. Finish. Do not forget. A million dollars. You have gorgeous skin. Do not touch me. I want to go. Not. Impossible. We have to wait for Jean-Louis. And you also have wet clothes. What beautiful legs you have. Where is Jean-Louis? - At his brother's. He is a pharmacist. He thought you needed medicine. Someone so special. I don't understand him. Someone as special as you. Take these. Get dressed. What medicines are we talking about? I don't know. I didn't understand very well. I only know that he took his bicycle to reach the village. Why ? - He was talking about an emergency. In any case, we have to wait for it. Hi. She is Yvonne. - Hi. This child is Edward. - Hi. I hope the pants fit you. I didn't find anything else. Thank you. I think the pants suit me. Don't be afraid of George. It won't eat you. You must know this. If you had told me I would have looked for other pants. It could have been very funny. I think you are very beautiful. Very pretty. Come on kids. Get out of here. Play outside. come on Move. Hurry up. - Hi. Hurry up. - Just a second. This is my brother, Andr. You already know my uncle. And you met my children. Am I here to meet your family? We play Zorro. He arrested a woman to help him. What this means ? Tell me. You must take this medicine every 15 minutes. Even at night. It is very important. Of course. How much do I have to pay for this? I want to pay for it. You have to stay here for a few hours. I can't let you go. This is just a joke. - It's no joke. That's right. It's no joke. Are you crazy? I want to go home. Don't you understand? Why can't you leave me alone? Tell her. - We know your husband. - And how do you know him? - Because of your driver's license. I saw it in your bag. - Why did you marry this bastard? Yes, a bastard. If a man has a wife like you, he shouldn't sleep with others. Interesting. Why do you know all this? Stop bragging. I'm not interested in your husband. We all know him. He is arrogant and relentless. We also know what he does. He is a criminal. You can't get to a hospital. You would be lost. You shouldn't leave here. I think your husband keeps you locked up in the house. He gets you high on drugs. What a beautiful future. What can I do ? Stay here until you dare. Do you know this woman? - Not. are you sure Mike, let's search on the boat. Mike. You found it ? - Not. Go to the left, I'll take the right. Do you know this girl? - Not. Listen. I want to go. I feel good. You must be patient. Only Jesus can perform miracles. But I'm not a believer. You are on an island. Our island. You can leave. But I don't want to be guilty of your loss. You can take my boat. But be careful. Very nice. come on Just breathe. You have to move more flexibly. Up with your elbows. You can breathe better that way. Stay calm. come on Let's go. Try to run a few more meters. Shoulders... up. Just breathe. And now we will do a short sprint. two hundred 00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,952 You'll see. No problem. Two or three more runs on the beach and you will feel much better. Believe me. I already tried to stop. But my husband gives me some drugs. He is crazy. It corrupts me. Even here I have drugs. - I don't understand. If he really loved you, he wouldn't give you drugs. He thought he was doing something good. He was talking about our future. But I don't believe him anymore. About the future? Future... We live in the present. All you have to do is take care. You have to take your luck with your own hands. Is strange. Sometimes before I used to tell him things like that. But ignore me. More. He told me to think about the future. Forget the present. To the future and nothing else. You just don't want to tell me that a beautiful woman like you... You really are beautiful. I would have thought only of the present if you were with me You are beautiful. Very pretty. Maybe these could be the last days of our vacation. You know I have a husband. This is the truth. He exists. And your children need the mother they want. My wife fell from the boat. It was stormy. I looked for it but couldn't find it. And the ocean would never give it back to me. I like to chat with you. About the present and the future. And about everything else. However, there are also other things: The sun, the beach, the ocean. Let's enjoy life. - Yes. Hello. I am friends with Jasmin. I would like to visit her. I'm sure you can tell us where your sister is. Well, you look magnificent. Where can we find Jasmin? I haven't seen her in a very long time. Please, get out of here. My husband will arrive soon. Mike. Bad luck! Come on. Let's get out of here. What's going on ? Mike! It's not here. We are wasting our time. What do you think ? are you sure Don't you want to stay a few more days? You'd better make a phone call. No, Jean-Louis. That is the reality. My holidays are over. Yes you are right. Goodbye. See you. - Goodbye. Pleasant trip. Say hello to the children from me. A cold coke, please. Hello? Yes... It's me, Paul. He took the ferry. And now he drives to the city. Without that guy. A second. I call Stanley. Paul is on the phone. He wants to talk to you. Excuse me. I'll be back in a minute. Hello? Here comes Stanley... It seems that Francois' wife is coming home. Good Francois gave a fright. Not for nothing. It was true that he did not kill him. Just enough to bring her back. Hello? Listen to me, Paul. Stay where you are. Of course, boss. I'm sending Gordon and Mike to you. They will solve the problem. Gordon and Mike? Be better ? - It is none of your business. OK? I hope you understood. We should not lose sight of Francois. Maybe he is her accomplice. And if he doesn't have the drugs? We'll find the drugs. Must... If not... If not ? If not Francois and Jasmin they will bite the dirt. I forgot to tell you. I have a new assistant. You're crazy. We don't have enough money. How to pay for an assistant? But we need it. More... Moreover, I love the wind, the rain, the sea and the sun. Try to grab the rope. Attention! Damn... It's not that easy. But it's fun. Let's go. Do not worry.. We will win the cause in the end. Jean-Louis! Jean-Louis! I love you. I think we are not on the right track. - No, we are on the right track. I can't understand how anyone that Stanley... ... he can trust this woman. This business involves enormous risks. You can be arrested and convicted. He has nothing to risk. I don't know. I wouldn't do anything before to have an advantage from this job. And Jasmin is not a bad girl. You never know what will happen. Mike. Sometimes I don't understand you. 500 million. I wouldn't have any more problems. But this woman... Trust me... You will pay for this... What happened here? What happened ? Just wait a moment. Believe me. Please tell me, George. What does it mean ? Well... I was sleeping when he came in. Like a tornado... Why are you laughing ? Not ! Jasmin. Finish. Straight ahead. This means war. You can do the work around the house. You can start right now. A declaration of war. - Not. It's too hard for me. come on Get up. Clean the floor. How can you live in this awkward house? Stop it!... Not the coffee pot! Jasmine! Let's make peace. OK? What is her problem? You wanted a woman in this house. This is the result. Let me show you, old whiner. Look here! It doesn't do anything. Do not answer. But I think that in the end there will be nothing safe and sound in this house. Do you think it's clean? I'll show you. Look at this pan. Is it really clean? Look at my fingers. Clean? Clean on your face? Not. Do not touch me. What do you think of this awkward thing? Made in the past century. What about the cat here? Stupid cat! What did we do to you? Not ! Stop this! They will tear down our house. Take care of her! How funny! No, dear. I surrender. I love you darling. Daddy. I have to pee. It's always the same. Can't do this at home? tell me where In bed ? I didn't have enough time for breakfast. OK. Hurry up. We are not at the Olympics. - Hurry up. Stop talking so much. It's terrible. Every morning the same thing. We fight every time. We will miss the ship and wait for 2 hours. Yvonne is right. For my part, the ship can go to hell. Do you think the teachers will visit us at home? Ask George. It's not very pleasant for me to leave you every morning. If you want... We don't have to go to my school. It would be nice to hang out with you. - I would agree. What do you think George would say? You are full of nerves lately. It would be better if you married her. What the ? Mary? Who is it about? Stop playing with us. I saw you and Jasmin on the beach. It will surely make your bed and make your eyes open. come on Marry her. Listen to your brother. - Listen, dad. If you will marry her she will sew my sweater too. Look here. Good. Let's get back to ours. But I am very happy to be your father. OK. Ready. Let's hurry to catch the ferry. Go to the beach. I have to make a phone call. It will only take a few minutes. But don't go too far. OK? I'll see you right away. Hello? Tu eti, trfa dracului ? Call him. You are in a hurry. Of course. Give me Francois. If I don't close. You can talk to him. I'm Jasmin. Jasmin, my dear. where are you What's going on with you? I'm waiting for you. You always lie. Nothing has changed. My dear, what's going on? where are you I will take you to dinner. Only the two of us. Believe me. And with those two boys as a bonus. No, believe me. Only the two of us. I promise you. Don't promise me anything. I dont believe you anymore. I believed in you too many times in the past. tell me where are the drugs I need them. You mean heroin? At the bottom of the ocean I fed the fish in the ocean. Go fishing. She's crazy. That is why he will die. Stop pushing me. Will your father also come to this port? - Yes. He comes every evening, before sunset. Maybe he won't come tonight. - Stop the jokes. If I'm done, you'll go home. Who will help you tonight? - Andre. - He is a bachelor. Look at them. - Hi. - Hi. Tonight you will sit next to George. And treat him well. Good evening, Jasmin. - Hi. Ok, I will leave you. - I'm happy that the day is over. Well. Let's go. - Hurry up. Jasmin is impatient. Daddy. Will Jasmin stay at home? - I hope so. I would be lucky. Let's go. - See you later. Let's go. Follow me. I want to show you something. No no. - Come on. Finish. You have gone crazy. Not here. - I want you now. - But if someone comes over us? - No one will discover us. You want that too, don't you? - Yes. Oh, my dear! It wasn't bad. - Not. It was really good. Let's go to the beach. I like it when you're excited. You are such a natural. Oh, my leg! It hurts !
