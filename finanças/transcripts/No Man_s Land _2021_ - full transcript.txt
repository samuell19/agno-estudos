(FILM PROJECTOR ROLLING) (SMOOTH GUITAR MUSIC) (ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC) (WIND BLOWING) (GENTLE MUSIC) Come on, here we go. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Your boy gives 110% of everything he does. I don't need to tell you what a spot on the Yankees AA club would mean for Jackson. Nope, no, no. We are very well aware. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Woo! Woo! Ya-hoo! (COWS MOOING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) - Whoa, here boy! - There you go, Jackson. Just like old times. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Goddammit, Lucas! (HORSE NEIGHING) Hey, come on, come on, come on! Let's get him! Let's get him, Sundance! Woohoo! What the heck? Hey man. Been waiting so long, thought I'd take a swim over to Mexico. You cut me off. It ain't my fault Rooster's a faster horse. Yeah right. You had him and he knows it, Sundance. All right big brother, double or nothing back to the house. Woo! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Eat my dust, boy! So you're really staying here all summer? Couldn't wait to get home and shovel shit with you. Come on, you know you can't run this place without me. I just figured you'd be off training somewhere. Got the big Yankees tryout next week, better be ready. Rather train with you. Good luck telling mom that. She won't shut up about it. Oh, my baby in New York. Boy's going all the way. GAME ANNOUNCER: Hammers the plate in. When you go into the Yanks system, you're set for life. Come on man, it takes years to make it to the bigs. We've got so much to do right here, right pop? Well you don't want trade that for this. Come on, dang piece of crap. Dad. DAD: What? Come on, use my computer. Set up a spreadsheet on Excel. I'll tell you something, why don't you just worry about that arm? Dad, I like the ranch. Well, then when you get your big signing bonus from the New York Yankees you can pay off our mortgage. Right darlin'? (DOGS BARKING) Oh shit. What is that? Stay here. Just stay here. (DOGS BARKING) (COWS MOOING) No way. Jackson. Jackson. I'm going mom. (COWS MOOING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) LUCAS: Hey dad, they cut the fence! Dad! You seeing this? Keep them away from the house! Get out of here! Go on, git! Get the hell outta here! Git! (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Get the hell off our land! - Go on, get outta here! - Go back in the house. Go on. Go on. - LUCAS: Dad, you all right? - MR GREER: Yup. (HORSE NEIGHING) Whoa, whoa, Sundance. Whoa Sundance, it's okay. Whoa, Sunny. (ROOSTER CLUCKING) LUCAS: Jackson! You seen anybody in here? No. LUCAS: Shit! God damn cattle are everywhere! Dad, you going after them? I'm coming with you. (SOMBER MUSIC) You're up early. JACKSON: How'd it go? Got a couple. Dad's handing them over to border patrol. How's it feel when you catch them? Remember we used to go fishing out at Robbins Pond? Yeah? Remember how I used to always catch that same bass? Over and over again. Sure, it was catch and release. Right right right. But you think that after getting the hook in them and ripping themselves up all bloody that the fish would wise up. But they just kept coming on back. You know why? Why? 'Cause they're hungry. (CAR ENGINE HUMMING) (ENGINE STOPS) (SPEAKING SPANISH) It's like Dad said it would be... just great! He never said it would be this cold. I never knew my grandkids could be so whiny. Silly little boys! (SPEAKING SPANISH) Dad said we should wait for him here. Doesn't matter. He's not "The Shepherd" anymore. We need a real coyote. Real coyotes will rob you and leave you to die. Shut up and sit down. I'll be right back. How much? 35 for the rabbit. 20 for the fruit and 20 for the water. Dad said we shouldn't buy anything here. You'll need more than agua, (SPEAKING IN SPANISH). Check this out. You can drill those Texans a new asshole with this. How much for that? I can loan it to you. Then maybe you help me out out there, you know. Just have to carry one of those with you, huh. So? GUSTAVO: Enrique! Ah shit. Papa? The Shepherd! Damn ninos, why didn't you tell me you was with the Shepherd? But Gustavo, we need it to defend against the Minutemen. A bunch of fat guys drinking beer in lawn chairs? What a joke! Your pops helped me cross when I was your age. Said he'd protect me and my mama, get us a better life. It's kind of funny you know 'cause, I don't really remember you after that, Gustavo. We do the same thing, padre. We can even do it, (SPEAKING IN SPANISH). (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) I do it for the church. So that no coyote can mess with my people. See you on the other side, Shepherd! Put that dirt in the back. Watch your hand. You put your hand there again I'm gonna hit it. All right. How many you think we lost? Counted about 10 this morning. 10. Prime heifers. Two grand a head. What you want to do, dad? We're going to Mexico and get our property back. That's what I'm gonna do. Ooh, that's what I'm talking about. Not you. Just me and Lucas. Come on dad, it's gonna be dark out there. Not you. What, you're gonna need my help. I said, ah! God! JACKSON: You all right? Yeah, I'm okay, I'm just sick of this shit. Grab that real quick. Jackson, Lucas, keep working. (LUCAS SCOFFS) You gonna leave me here? All right. MAN ON RADIO: Y'all hear about them coyotes in Laredo? MAN ON RADIO: No, what happened? MAN ON RADIO: Well they've been poisoning ranch dogs to shut them up when they cross. MAN ON RADIO: Oh man, that, that's not gonna work. I'll be ready with a load of buckshot for them beaners they try that bullshit... Move on, let's go. Let's go. Listen to me. Me and your mom, we're trapped here, we're stuck. Not you, you got college, baseball. You have a gift. I like ranching. (DAD SCOFFS) Ranching. Don't know if you notice but we're on the wrong side of the fence. I don't know how long we're gonna have a ranch. And all you want to talk to me about is baseball. - Who gives a shit? - Hey hey hey, language. You gonna give it a shot. You knock them Yankees on their asses. It don't work out, don't work out. Who gives a shit? Watch your language. (DAD LAUGHS) Come on, Tanner. Bad enough I gotta show my passport to go to the hardware store. Go ahead Mr Greer. Thank you. Here's the water, guys! Pass it around. Rest for a little. Come on, son. Let's climb up together. You'll see how beautiful it is. (SERENE MUSIC) (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) You see that hill over there? Well, a little bit closer to us is Texas. Texas looks just like Mexico. Yeah, it really does. Will you still be "The Shepherd" in Texas? Well, someone else has to do it. I missed you so much. Me too, son. We're gonna go get those cows across the river. Be back by morning. Come help your momma out. Oh. (MOM SIGHS) This looks like fun. (MOM LAUGHS) Ya ya! Come on fatty, come on! Getting back to cross. Still missing three. Dad, I can't see. Count to ten. How about now? Better. See? It's all good now. Sometimes you have to close your eyes and start over to see things clearly. Let's go. Fernando, wait for me. I got a little gift for you. I'm gonna keep this forever. You're just like your mother. She used to keep every penny. Always saving up. You remind me of her in every way. What happened? That's what "real" coyotes do. Not like your father. Let's go, let's go. Keep moving. You know it's just gonna get dirty again. Then I'll wash it again. (LAUGHS) Now there's your baseball smile. I've been missing that lately. This is our home, ma. I don't want to lose it. Saving the ranch is not your job. Come on, you're going to New York. Aren't you excited? Yeah. But you know AA pitchers, they throw an average of like 92 MPH. Do you remember that church league game? Y'all were getting whooped. Half of the parents packed up by the fifth. Yeah the other half were yelling to yank me off the mound. I didn't want to make you more nervous, so I started waiting - from the snack bar. - From the snack bar. Yes! The more they scored the harder you threw. We lost that game. By one run. And I swear that kid, he was out at the plate. - He was out. - Yeah, that's what I said. The point is, you played it out, Jacks. You didn't give up. What, where are you going? Jacks, where are you going? Got me a game to finish. (MELANCHOLY MUSIC) (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) TEACHER RECORDING: I'm going to my friend's house. (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) Let's do it one more time. (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) If we go back now we look like idiots, all right. We're not going back. Just gotta find... (GUNSHOT FIRING) Ya! (GUNSHOT FIRING) Don't move! Don't move. Hey dad, I got three of them over there. Hey man, we want no trouble. Stop moving! - GUSTAVO: Miguel! - Stay there, don't move. No, stay back, hey! - Back up! - Take it easy. - Wait, wait. - Don't you move. - Don't you move. - We're passing by, man. Don't you move. Get down. GUSTAVO: We want no trouble. I don't know what she's saying, dad! What you want me to do? I got you, I got you. Don't move. Don't you move. Down on your knees, everybody down, down. GUSTAVO: Sir, we're just passing by. MR GREER: You down, down, get down. - You two, down. - Take easy. LUCAS: Get back! Get back right now! Go on, back up! Get down on your knees, now! GUSTAVO: We don't want trouble. DAD: I told you to sit down. I said get back. - Don't move. - Get down. Ya ya, ho! MR GREER: I said get down. Dad I'm here, what do you need? Down down down, I said get down. Keep your arms there. - Are you armed? - GUSTAVO: No sir, no sir. - You sure. - Yes. Dad! GUSTAVO: We want no trouble. I got you dad! - I'm here! - Jack, what are you? Oh! GUSTAVO: We want no trouble man. (INTENSE MUSIC) JACKSON: Dad. Dad move out of the way! LUCAS: Jackson! What the hell are you doing here? (GUNSHOT FIRING) No! Papa! (GUNSHOT FIRING) (FERNANDO GASPING) Move! Fernando! (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) Fernando! (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) Get away. Get away Jackson. Dad. Luke! Luke! Luke! Lucas! Hey, hey! Let me see it, let me see. Oh Jesus. GUSTAVO: Fernando! (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) What do I do? Tell me what you want me to do. MR GREER: Look at me, look at me. Hold him, hold him! JACKSON: Okay okay okay. (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) (SIRENS BLARING) MR GREER: Stay here, stay here. I got him, I got him, I got him. Dad where are you going? (GUNSHOT FIRING) Go! Move! Please. MR GREER: Policia. Go go. GUSTAVO: Come on man. - Please. - Tell him to go. He's my son! Dad, what are you doing? Move. Please. I swear to God I'll kill him! (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) - He's my son! - Policia, go! GUSTAVO: My son! Dad! (SIRENS BLARING) Dad. Hey, hey. The cops are here. JACKSON: They're gonna help you, hang on. Hey, we need help! - We need help! - Help! RAMIREZ: Freeze! - Don't shoot me. - Don't shoot him. - Don't move. - MR GREER: It's my son. JACKSON: We need help. RAMIREZ: So this coyote just pulls a knife and stabs you. MR GREER: Right. And then y'all started fighting for the rifle. Right. He stabbed me here. Yup. He grabbed my rifle and, and we were struggling for a bit. He got the best of me, he did knock me down. My boy Lucas was on the other side and, he took a shot and he hit him. (JACKSON CRYING) And then he turned around on me and uh, I had run back to my horse to grab my bolt action and, that's when the little boy jumped in front of me. Mm-hm, mm-hm. And I shot him. Makes me sick that this kid lost his life for the sins of this coyote. What did I do, God? I got narcos and smugglers on my property every dang day. Every dang day. I know you know that. Mm-hm. And if I gotta take, take this into my own hands to keep it in check then so be it. I understand. So, um, basically what you're saying is that it was all self defense. It's not basically, it's self defense. Yeah, a lot of wet cattle roaming around when I got there. Never seen steer move towards gunfire before. You know my boy is laying in there clinging to his life. Maybe it's time I go sit with my wife now. We're almost done sir. We're almost done. Now what were y'all doing out there so late? Some kind of minute man thing there, son? We take good care of our family. It's just something you do, you know? Well this boy you shot, he has family too. It was an accident. That how you saw it? It was hectic out there, son. Self defense. Just like my dad said. Y'all couldn't just run them off? We tried. We don't speak Spanish, Officer Ramirez. I don't speak Spanish either sir, and it's Ranger. You work horses, Ranger? No sir, I never have. You learn early on not to walk behind horses 'cause they kick you in the head. You see, long time ago they used to be chased down by wolves, so, as time went on they stopped looking what was back there, they just kick. I'll have to remember that. Now don't leave town, Mr Greer. MR GREER: Don't leave town, Mr Greer. All stick together. Let's go see your mother. Dad, you and Lucas didn't do anything... I fired the shot. You hear me boy? I took the shot. You took the shot. Yes sir. Shall we go to the church, son? Aren't you going to talk to me? Talk to me. Don't hold it inside. Gustavo, you're a man of faith. I'm nothing. I'm not a husband. I'm not a father. I'm nothing. Fernando is with his mother now. They're happy... They're not suffering anymore. Let's go pray. Don't turn your back on God. Who turned their back on whom? I always followed him and adored him. Now look what that asshole did! Forgive me, son. Forgive me! (SOMBER MUSIC) My dad didn't do nothing. I know. This ain't fair. They were on our land. Well, come with me and we'll work it out. You're not listening. This is their fault. You shot a boy in the back. You weren't there. Well I'm here now. Come with me, Jackson. Hey! Hey! Son of a! (TENSE MUSIC) Come on! Shit. Where do you think you're going? There's no where to go! There's no where to go. (TENSE MUSIC) (INTENSE MUSIC) Jackson! You got no where to go! Ya, come on boy! Go go! Come on boy. Good job Sundance, come on. Come on Sundance. Come on. Yeah, yeah, yeah. God damn. Good job Sundance, come on. Come on Sunny. Ya! (SOMBER MUSIC) How's he doing? How dare you chase our son off to Mexico like he's some criminal. Call your son, Mr Greer. Tell him to come home. I told you before, Jackson had nothing to do with this. That's all I'm gonna say about it. Ma'am, he is not safe out there. Things could get a lot worse. Worse? They gut shot our son right in our front 40. With your husband's rifle. A child died too. I suggest you both start helping me before you run out of sons. Call your son, Mr Greer. Ma'am. (JACKSON PANTING) (JACKSON SIPPING WATER) Come on, it's all we got. Suit yourself. (COW MOOING) Yeah, I thought I recognized you. (SHUSHING) Easy, easy easy easy. Easy girl, easy. Easy, easy. (SHUSHING LIGHTLY) (COW MOOING) You're all right. There you go. Go on. Go, go on, you're free. Go! Go on! God. Come on, go. Go boy, run you dumb cow! Go on, go! Go on! (COW MOOING) What you looking at? (JACKSON GAGGING) (JACKSON VOMITING) You made your point. Ah. (PHONE RINGING) VOICEMAIL RECORDING: Hey, this is Jackson Greer. Leave a message and I'll call you back. Gig 'em. Jackson, I need you to come home son. Call me.

You think you can help me find a ride? Sure. How much you got? Not much. Relax, just leave the horse with me. (TENSE MUSIC) (JACKSON GRUNTING) So how you like Mexico, huh? (JACKSON GRUNTING) Back! Back God damn it! Get back! Back up. Back! Back! (ROPE WHIPPING) (INTENSE MUSIC) (GUNSHOTS FIRING) Ya, ya! Mr Almeida? Sorry for your loss, sir. Thank you. I do need to see some ID before you can see him. I'm not concerned with your immigration status, that's not why I'm here. Thank you, sir. You got a green card. Why was your son crossing illegally? I filed an I-130 petition to bring him. He was denied. I'm sorry. Uh, you want him buried in Mexico? Guanajuato, our hometown. Of course. Truly again, I'm sorry sir. May I go see my son? Absolutely, follow me. (GUSTAVO CRYING) (EMOTIONAL MUSIC) (DARK MUSIC) (GUSTAVO CRYING) Hold it please. Thanks. (SOMBER MUSIC) (JACKSON WINCING) Stop stop stop. Stop, I gotta get off. Stop, stop. (JACKSON GRUNTING) (JACKSON WINCING) You're not alone. No father should bury his son. So, how are we gonna handle this kid? He's headed south on a (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) horse. I'm going to do this alone. And he's not a kid. Padre, I liked your hijo. Strong. Come on. (TENSE MUSIC) Do you have water?

(MELANCHOLY MUSIC) And sure enough, there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me. I sat still and listened. Directly I could just barely hear a meow, meow down there. Says I, meow, meow, as soft as I could, and then I put out the light and scrambled out the window onto the shed. Then I slipped down to the ground and crawled in amongst the trees, and sure enough. You wanna trade? Sorry. No, it's okay. It's okay. Uh, (SPEAKING IN SPANISH). (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) Gracias senor. What kind of weird fruit it this? Prickly pear. Try it. All right.

We went tip-toeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of the widow's garden. Stooping down so as the branches wouldn't scrape our heads. When we was passing by the kitchen, I fell over a root and made a noise. Ms Watson's big, friend, named Jim, was sitting in the kitchen door. (SERENE MUSIC) We could see him pretty clear because there was a light behind him. He got up and stretched his neck out about a minute, listening. Then he says, who there? He listened some more. Then he come tip-toeing down and stood right between us. We could have touched him, nearly. Well, likely it was minutes and minutes that there weren't a sound. And we all there so close together. (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) Sir. Senor, I've been waiting here for hours, now come on. My counselor called your boss, okay? Jackson Greer's murder case. (SHUSHING) It's a murder case senor.

We're just going home for break? So it's that easy? I mean y'all can just go back and forth? (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) Huh? We're not all immigrants, you know. I just figured 'cause you were teaching him English, you'd be coming from America. We are in America right now, you know? Latin America. Right. I'm an English teacher in Tamaulipas. But we're headed home to Leon. You know, it's funny what you just said about America and all. My, my dad says we don't live in America. We live in Texas. And what, what does that mean? I don't know. (WOMAN LAUGHS) Now I will admit, I, I didn't know how big Mexico was. And where are you going? Ganajato. Where? Ganajato. (WOMAN LAUGHS) You're going somewhere and you don't even know how to pronounce it. I think you mean Guanajuato, right? Guanajuato. Guanajuato Perfect. Remember when we used to drop off water and blankets and jerky down by the river? I do. What happened to us? You know, they just kept coming and coming. I was just trying to protect us. And it's not like they're little kids anymore looking for farm jobs. They're in our backyards every week. And dealing with coyotes and drugs and guns and cartels, in our backyard. I don't know what to do. It's different now. Yeah. But we're different. I know. I'm gonna make it right. I'll make it right. (TIRES SCREECHING) Why'd we stop? I don't know. There's no bus stop here.
