Hail Lord Ram! What are you up to? I'm trying to lift your veil. Please don't. Mom said not to be hasty. She also told you to be a good wife, right? Very funny. Men know of nothing else! Siring kids is no less than an achievement. As if it requires wit! You're right. No point having many kids. It's the age of family planning. I think 3 are fine. One will be an army officer. The second will be a naval officer and the third will be in air force. They will serve our country. Okay? You're building castles in the air. Trust me, more will be risky. Imagine if the fourth becomes a lawyer, he'll manipulate things. If the fifth becomes a tout, the government will raid our house and humiliate us. If the sixth... - Stop it. I'm okay with three. How do we beget kids until you lift your veil? Come on, now. - At home. Why wait that long? Ashu! Buds unveil into bloom and bees dance around flowers. Buds unveil into bloom and bees dance around flowers. It's the season of love and romance. Buds unveil into bloom and bees dance around flowers. When you walk in the garden, every flowers smile. When you walk in the garden, every flowers smile. When I see your veil fall off, I go crazy! It's the season of love and adoration. Buds unveil into bloom and bees dance around flowers. Your mesmerising ways cast a spell all around. Your mesmerising ways cast a spell all around. You equal the sun's brilliance and sweetness of wine. It's the season of love and adulation." Buds unveil into bloom and bees dance around flowers. Come, sweetheart. You bring peace to my aching heart. Come, sweetheart. You bring peace to my aching heart. Your enchanting beauty makes me yearn for you. It's the season of love and passion. Buds unveil into bloom and bees dance around flowers. It's the season of love and romance. Buds unveil into bloom and bees dance around flowers. Ashu! - Let me go. Ashu! - What are you doing? What insolent behaviour! - I won't leave you tonight. I'm not Ashu! I'm Amjad! What's wrong? I was hugging Ashu. I didn't realise it was you! Amjad, you spoilt the fun. This is no fun at all. If you keep doing this, my bones will crack someday! You're angry? You're as important as Ashu to me. Really? Come, hug me! I too miss Shabnam. I would fall for a beautiful face. I miss those days filled with love. It was all in the past, Amjad. I think we'll die bachelors. You're right. My mother won't let me marry Shabnam. Shabnam is educated and sings on the radio. She dances in clubs and is modern. My mother believes such a girl won't make a faithful wife. Hence... I left my home and wealth for Shabnam's sake. Now I work with you as a salesman. My problems are different. I have no parents. All I have is a step brother, Bhagat who eyes Ashu. He's the village rogue. All villagers fear him. No priest dares to get me married to Ashu. He has threatened me. If I enter the village, he'll kill Ashu. - Really? Amjad, I'm in exile like lord Ram. The only difference is Ram was accompanied by Sita, while I have you with me. If you truly love Ashu, why don't you get her here? I want to but where do I keep her? We live here as paying guests who never pay! If it were your house, I'd surely get her. What do we do? I'll be Shabnam for you and you be Ashu for me. Ashu! - Shabnam! My eyes weep endlessly. Ashu, where did you learn that song? Heard it on the radio my brother got. How was it? - Nice. Oh dear! Be careful lest you sprain your back. Ashok isn't here. How will you manage? What do you want Ashok for? Your devotee Bhagat is here! Bhagat is here! Run! Sir, look how everyone fled on seeing you! Let them go. I just want Asha to be here. Let go off me. Why? No man would do that. Ashok alone can hold my hand. You're mistaken. Ashok dare not enter this village. Or I'll set him right. Indeed, you can do that. Do as he says else... - I said leave me. My bangle will break. I'll get you another one. Really? - Absolutely. I too shall give you something. What? Tell me. Tell him. First leave my wrist. Here you go. Tell me what you'll give me. I'll tie you a 'rakhi'. - Shut up! This is what you deserve to get. How dare you! I'll teach you a lesson for sure. Sir... Get up, sir. Forget making her your wife. She's already stubborn. What will she do after marriage? Who's in need of a wife? I'm interested in the land her brother owns. Brother, where are you? I'm mad! I'm mad. I'll break your head. I'm mad. I'll break your head. I'm mad. I'm mad! I'm mad. I'll break your head. I'm mad. Move aside! I'm mad! Asha, what's wrong? Why are you crying? Brother, have you truly lost it? Look how well I act! I was rehearsing for the drama tonight. Please don't partake such dramas. Who will if I don't? Dad is no more. If you go mad, what will I do? Dad died, I won't. Why are you scared? Brother, Bhagat... - Did he die? No! - How sad he didn't! He troubled me again. Troubled again? Yes. I was filling water in the pots when he held my wrist. Then he started calling names to Ashok. I slapped him. Slapped hard? - Yes, then I fled. Very good. Who does he think he is? He thinks I'm your step sister. How dare he! How do I get water now? Go to the other well till I settle this matter with Bhagat. Make sure you cover your face. But Bhagat is cunning. You can't trap him. My name is Bhagwan. I'll teach him a lesson. He'll never again hold any woman's hand! This is the limit, sir. Ashu is headed this way. Don't let her go. Wait till she comes. I'll take her along like a caged bird. Sir, there she is. I'm no bird, but a beast! Sir, she's alone. - Quiet! I too shall go alone. Wait right here. But sir, be loving to her. Asha, my dear! Speak lovingly to me. I've been eagerly waiting for you. Why have you covered your face? You think I wouldn't recognise you? I'd find you no matter how hard you try to hide. You got slapped, yet you won't give up. Your hand felt like a rose petal to me! Idiot, after I slapped you I couldn't sleep all night. Really? What a waist! Don't walk so gracefully. My heart goes berserk. Don't walk so gracefully. My heart goes berserk. You're glide like a snake when you... When you glide mystically! Don't walk so gracefully. Listen to me. It's very hot. What do I do about it? Let your hair loose. It's a hot afternoon. Let your hair loose. It's a hot afternoon. The gleaming sun shall be subdued under the shadow of... Under the shadow of your tresses. Don't walk so gracefully. My heart goes berserk. Don't walk so gracefully. What lies! Don't make fun of me. Lest the world envies us. Don't make fun of me. Lest the world envies us. One might kiss your smiling face for it is... For it is pretty as a flower. Don't walk so gracefully. My heart goes berserk. Don't walk so gracefully. All right, I won't laugh at you! Don't just say you're in love. Don't just say you're in love. The word love is powerful It brings peace... It brings peace to the heart. Don't walk so gracefully. My heart goes berserk. You're glide like a snake when you... When you glide mystically! Don't walk so gracefully. Yes, the sale is on. You're welcome. Thank you. Amjad, look at this! Awesome! Who is it for? For Ashu! She wanted me to buy her beautiful bangles. I bought them for Rs 300! You know how difficult it was to arrange for the money. How did you like them? - Beautiful! May god keep her safe from evil eyes. Customer! - Thank you, darling. Good morning, ma'am. - Good morning. Show me a toy for her. - Yes, ma'am. Here you go. It's a new toy. You too can play with it. It's just a monkey. What are you saying? The Animal Association has awarded him the best musician award! How so? He copies music very well. You're interesting! Pack this. - Right away. This is the last piece. You might not get it later. You're the first customer of the day. Hope it won't break. - It won't. It's a sturdy toy. Let alone your child, even your grandchild can play with it. I'm unmarried! What did you think? Tell me, what do you think? Forgive me. You might be unmarried. But I am like your son! What non sense! Allah, what a woman! Amjad! Sir! - Come to the office. Why are you worried? - I'm in trouble. I'll come along. Ashok, why have you come? Please leave. I will, sir. First tell me what the matter is. He broke the showcase worth Rs 200! I'm sorry, sir. I didn't break it deliberately. Shut up. Why be rude, sir? Because we're your employees? Times have changed, sir. India is a free country. Amjad broke the showcase and you're arguing his case. What's that supposed to mean? Amjad is my friend. I won't hear a thing against him. Keep mum, Ashok. - Be quiet, Amjad. In that case, ask him to pay up for the showcase. Deduct the amount from my next salary. Next salary? I'm sacking you right away. If you do that, I'll resign too! Let's go, Amjad. - Wait! Pay up before you leave or I'll call the police. Sir, we have worked here for years. You'll hand us over to the police for a broken showcase? I don't care. Forgive us, sir. Why do you plead? I'm still alive. Keep these gold bangles. They're worth Rs 300. What are you doing? I've done the right thing. My friend is more valuable than my girlfriend and her gift. Let's go. Take the balance amount. Consider it a donation for your poor kids. Let's go, Amjad. What arrogance! He called my kids poor! Shameless! Amjad, see if there's some vacancy. I'm ready to work as a peon! There are no vacancies. Amjad and Ashok have been evading me for days. They haven't paid the rent for last month. I'm here to throw them out. They haven't paid for the ration as well. I too won't leave. Knock on the door. Amjad! Amjad! - Landlord! He's here for the rent. Amjad! Do something. He's not home. Who's that? Who are you? - I'm his wife. Ma'am, is Ashok home? He isn't home either. When they come, tell them I was here for the rent. I will. Tell them about the bill for ration too. I will. What do we tell a woman? Let's go. - Okay. Amjad, see how talented I am. I agree. I made them go away... Be quiet. They're back. Why are you troubling a woman? Shameless people! I told you there's no man at home. Postman! - It's the postman. We're home! Amjad, it's for you. Open it. I'm sure it's a bill. I'll open but you pay it, okay? - Fine. Open it. It's not a bill. Read it. Ashok, it's good news! What is it? Mom has agreed. - Really? Here's what she says. - Read it quick. 'Dear Amjad, be happy.' 'You won, I lost.' 'I have fixed your marriage with Shabnam.' My friend is getting married! 'You'll marry on 30th March.' 'I shall leave for Hajj that very night.' 'Come back as soon as you receive this letter.' Mom is great! Finally mom gave into my desires. Nothing compares to a mother's love. May everyone be blessed with mother's love. What happened to you? Nothing, Amjad. I miss my mom. Anyway, you're leaving. What will I do here all alone? You think I'll leave you alone? I can leave my wife, not you! Don't say that, pal. I can't give you what your wife can! Won't you come? Not just you, Ashu too shall come. You wanted a house, right? We have a house now. You know I have no sister. Ashu will be like a sister to me. I don't mind getting her. But I fear lest Bhagat wreaks havoc in your life. Don't worry about that. Bhagat can't harm anyone in my house. If you still refuse to come along, it'll imply that you care not for my wedding. You want me to die. Don't say that, dear friend. I will surely come come what may. Hello, sir. Who are you? - Your servant. What's your name? My name is Ashique. But hunger compelled me to love food above all else. You write verse? - Yes. Please carry the luggage inside. How much? - Rs 7.50. Ashique, whose luggage is this? Looks don't matter, ma'am. He seems a gentleman. Who is it? - See for yourself. Mom, hello. Amjad! Yes, it's me! You're so cruel. You got angry and left your mother! A son has all the rights to be angry with his mom. That's not fair. You never even wrote to me. You considered me dead. God forbid! Please don't say that. I swear by the almighty, I never stopped thinking of you. I'm sure you cursed me for separating you and Shabnam. - No, mom. In fact, I prayed for your wellbeing all along. I was sure you'd come around. Finally, I had to relent. Ma'am, a bough full of fruits always bends. My mother would always relent. She was too generous for my father to handle. No wonder he paid for it! See you. He speaks in verse! Forget about the dead. How long will you grieve? You're behind this. You killed my brother! How's that possible? Why will I kill my brother-in-law? Idiot! Shameless! Ashok is your younger brother, yet you woo me! May you rot in hell. You don't deserve to be alive. Only cowards die. I'm not one of them. Don't forget, there's an end to all evil. How disheartening! Talk about marriage instead. Marry you? Who else can you marry? Ashok has forgotten you. Trust me, he's already married. So, he never returned. You too should forget him. I'd rather bury you alive! I curse you, may you get some disease and die a miserable death. Enough, don't tire yourself. You can curse me all your life. Come to me now. Don't you dare come closer. Or I'll jump off this window. No! I won't let you die like this. You're the best jewel in my crown. May you live a long life. Sooner or later, we'll surely get married. Where else will you go? Get out of here! This should happen after marriage! Brother! Brother! Who is it? Ashok? Yes, it's me. Ashok! You've come after many years. Hope you're fine. - I am. Are you angry with me? - Why? You should've informed of your arrival. I would've sent a car to receive you. You consider me a step brother. Don't say that. You're all I have in this world. After dad's demise, you looked after me. You remember? - Indeed. Brother, how's Ashu? What do I tell you? Some rogue murdered her brother. And Ashu... - What about her? I'll tell you later. First eat something. No, tell me where Ashu is. Sit down. Lote! - Yes, sir? Sir, it's you! Hello. Lote. - Yes? Get him a glass of milk. Make sure it's full of cream. Absolutely. Tell me where Ashu is. Brother, I want to meet her. What do I tell you about Ashu? I feel ashamed to say this. After her brother's death, her flirting knew no bounds. She'd woo and flirt with many. She had relations with every young man in the village. Finally, she eloped with some rogue. Brother, you know all goons in the village. Who was he? I'll spank him to death. Why blame anyone? It's difficult to control a loose woman. It's rightly said, god help an immoral woman! Sir, milk. Ashok, have the milk. No, I'll look for Ashu. I won't let you just go. I insist. Please sit. All right. I'll have it for your sake. Give me. Brother, I listened to you. Now you do as I say. - What is it? Have the first sip. No, after you. After all, you're my elder brother. No, you go first. Please have it or I'll force it down. Have it! - No! You cheat! You're my enemy. Where is Ashu? I don't know. - Tell me! Get out of here. I will. I will surely find Ashu and teach you a lesson. Get lost! Lote! - Yes? Move Ashu from that place lest he learns the truth. Okay. I'll set him right for sure. Please come. Please come. Please come. Please come soon. Please come, my love calls out to you. My eyes weep endlessly. No one knows my pain. No one knows my pain. Please come, my love calls out to you. My eyes weep endlessly. No one knows my pain. No one knows my pain. Please come. Your love gave me strength then failed me. Your love killed me. Your love gave me strength then failed me. Your love killed me. I cry thinking of you. I can't express my woes. Please come, my love calls out to you. My eyes weep endlessly. No one knows my pain. No one knows my pain. Please come. The moon is dull without love. Come, lest you get separated from your love. The moon is dull without love. Come, lest you get separated from your love. Call out to me for my heart is filled with fear. Please come, my love calls out to you. My eyes weep endlessly. No one knows my pain. No one knows my pain. Please come. Please come. Where are you going? Take her away. - Leave me! Take her! Leave me! Wait... Hurry up! Asha! Leave her or I'll kill you all. Oh come on! - Catch him. Shut him up. You'll have to cross the river. How will you do that? I'll inform sir right away. Go ahead and inform him. We'll cross the river. Ashu, let's hide in that mosque. Okay. Truth shall prevail. - Liars shall perish. Truth shall prevail. Wait! Who are you? We're god's servants, child. We fulfil people's wishes. We make separated lovers unite. Did you see a girl on your way? I never saw a girl when I was young. I'm too old now! God bless my beloved. I need see no other girl. You got me wrong. The thing is... A rogue has kidnapped my girlfriend. I'm looking for him. Liars shall perish. Truth shall prevail. Son, if I get that girl here, what will you give us? I'll be your servant! Be ready. I'll look where she is. On one condition. What is it? Mother, tell me. Son, we want to go to a shrine on the other side of the river. Our followers await us. This old man can't row the boat. Doesn't matter if I'm old. I can beat such young men any day. Be quiet. Listen son, take us on the other side of the river. Okay. - Yes. We will sing along the way. That will motivate us. Consider yourself blessed if we slap you while singing. Then you shut your eyes and say, 'My love, one more.' Then your girlfriend will emerge and slap you. She'll lie unconscious at your feet. - I see. This is the best chance you'll ever get. Why wait? Let's go. Come, young man. Come, darling. Please sit. Come, mother. Bless you, son. Please begin. Here you go, son. Darling, show us your spark. Here you go. You'll get engulfed... On seeing my spark, you'll get engulfed. On seeing my spark, you'll get engulfed. If I lift my veil, you'll faint! If I lift my veil... The veil is a facade. It's just a guise. The veil is a facade. It's just a guise. Son, it's all about hiding the spark! If I lift my veil, you'll faint! On seeing my spark, you'll get engulfed. An angel called out to me from afar. Oh yes. He begged me to descend from heaven. I told him... I told him it's a curse for me. I pleaded him to leave me alone. On seeing my spark, you'll get engulfed. I'm no angel to faint on seeing you. I'm no angel to faint on seeing you. I'm willing to die for you! - Come on! I shall die with your name on my lips. I shall die with your name on my lips. Even as I die... - Awesome! Even as I die, I'll do this for you. Don't test my ability lest you regret it. Don't test my ability lest you regret it. On seeing my spark, you'll get engulfed. It's said judgement day will be tumultuous.' As long as you live, people will die of adoration!" You're insolent! You're depraved and vile. Who knew you'd fall for a vile man! How will you leave me and go? How will you leave me and go? If I lift my veil, you'll faint! On seeing my spark, you'll get engulfed. One more! Truth shall prevail. Liars shall perish. Truth shall prevail. Where will you go? I rule this place. I'll set you right or I'll eat my words! Hello. Who are you? I'm the tailor. I want to speak to your ma'am. Only sir is available. Who am I? I'm Ashique. Ashique who? Now what do I say? You talk too much. You need to be taught a lesson. Don't flirt over the phone. Meet me in person. Ashique, who was it? There was some woman. - Woman? Yes. Hello. Who's this? This is Shabnam's dad. Hello, dad. Just a moment. Silly fellow! You said it's a woman. Who is it then? This is your ma'am's dad. How did she turn into a man? - Get out. I'm sorry, dad. Tell me. Well, we want Shabnam to get married in our village. You see, all our relatives live there. We wanted to know if you or your mother would mind. Why would we? All right, son. Should I call Shabnam? Right away. Shabnam! Shabnam, how are you? I can't wait for you to come here and fill this house with cheer. Yes, Ashok and Ashu will be here. You will be with Ashu forever. How's that possible? Wait till I show you. Who? Mom? Okay. Ashok. What is it? I'm very thirsty. I can't go any further. They're here, Ashu. Get off the horse. They're hiding somewhere close. How far will they go? I can't see anyone here. God, you reside up above while devils rule the world below. Who's that? That's my uncle, Bhanwra. He's the watchman here. God, you reside up above while devils rule the world below. God help us all. Hello, my great uncle. Sing praise of the one above, not mine. The one above? Who's that? - The almighty God. Oh! Won't you come home? Home? I will. But you got to help me. What's the matter? I'll kill anyone for your sake. What's the matter? Uncle, my master's fiancé eloped with a rogue. Eloped? Oh dear lord! - The horses headed that way! That's where they must've gone. Let's follow them. Come along, uncle. - Yes. God, you reside up above They're gone. Let's get you some water. Happy now? - Yes. Let's go. - Okay. Come on! Hurry up lest they catch us. What've you been up to in the city? I kept thinking of you. Really? - Yes. What this? - What? I can smell another girl on you. Sharp sense of smell! Have you been sniffing for men in my absence? I wasn't. You were sniffing for women. Who's that girl you married? Married? Who told you that? Bhagat did. I see. You know everything. That's good. I was about to tell you to be good to the other woman. Here's her photo. Feels so good. Here, take a good look. I hate her! I'll kick her face. That wasn't the only photo. I have another one. Leave that witch. Don't you dare call her a witch. I won't spare you. If you don't throw her out, I won't spare you. That's not possible. I'm in love with her completely. All right, keep loving that witch. Again? Don't call her a witch. I will keep calling her a witch. Look at your anger! Your eyes are mesmerising. Your face is scarlet like wine. Your eyes weep like the endless sea. Your face is scarlet like wine. Your eyes weep like the endless sea. Oh my! Look at your anger! It makes you attractive! Your face is scarlet like wine. Oh those glaring looks can set stones on fire! Oh those glaring looks can set stones on fire! God help lovers like me who stare into your deep eyes. Oh my! Look at your anger! It makes you attractive! Your face is scarlet like wine. Why do you boil with rage? Please let go of this rage. Why do you boil with rage? Please let go of this rage. These passionate lips glimmer with fury! Oh my! Look at your anger! It makes you attractive! Your face is scarlet like wine. Your eyes weep like the endless sea. Oh my! Look at your anger! It makes you attractive! Your face is scarlet like wine. Where are you going? Don't stop me. Ashu, I'm a man. You know how angry men get. I wish you were a man. What? Yes. If you were, you wouldn't be with another woman. What's done is done. Come along, else I'll leave. I didn't ask you to wait. Okay, I won't come back even if you call me. Snake! Ashu, what happened? Ashu! What happened? - A snake bit me. Where? - On my thumb. Let me suck out the venom. Ashu! - Ashok! Yes, Ashu? - Ashok, forgive me. I'm leaving you forever. No, Ashu. I won't let you die alone. I'll die too. No, Ashok. Don't do that. Ashu! - Promise me you won't. Never. Ashu! Ashu, you can't leave me. I couldn't even tell you that photo was yours. Ashu, how do I tell you I thought of no woman but you? Ashu, you won't go alone. I'll drown in the water. God, forgive us. I'll drown! - You're alive? Take me home. I'll be good to the other woman. Really? God, no matter how many births I take, I'll never understand a woman. Because I'll be with you in every birth! Really? Let's go. Ashu, one is Amjad's and other is ours. I have no brother. But my friend Amjad is dearer than a brother. Who are you? - What are you looking at? Tie him up and catch her. How dare you elope! Take this axe and chop off his hands. Don't do that. Stop him. I'll marry Bhagat. No, Ashu. Don't do that. Let him go. I'm willing to marry. Take her to sir and prepare for the wedding. Take her. Where are you going? Uncle, kill him. Inform sir at his wedding. He'll load you with wealth. This is Rs 10 from sir. Get drunk. Don't worry, I'll end his life. Do that. Brother! Yes? Where are you from? Ayodhya. Lord Ram's land? Good lord! Lord, help me. That demon Ravan has kidnapped Sita. Let me go. Lord Ram will bless you. No, I can't cheat my master. My beloved! Where are you, darling? I'm here, sweetheart. Come in. Why don't you come all night? Doesn't love interest you anymore? What are you saying? I work as a watchman all night. Sit down, darling. Hope you aren't lying. - No. Men can't be trusted. They have fun and leave. No, Premkali. No girl is as lovely as you are. So you know how other girls are! Dear lord! Why will I leave you and go to others? - Let it be. Have this holy offering with Lord Shiva's blessings. Hail Lord Shiva. One more. Hail Lord Shiva. One more? - Of course. Premkali! Honest to God, I'm high. Believe me, if he weren't here, I'd have loved you tonight! Why are you grinning? I'm admiring your beauty. 'Beedi'? - 'Beedi'! Here. Lose woman, you're wooing him? Oldie, don't blabber. If you talk too much, I'll slit your tongue! Lord Ram! No woman can be trusted. Nothing but deception. Get lost. Stop crying and enjoy. Begin. Look how devious men are! When they see a woman, they begin to woo her. They make do with any pretty face. Our eyes met and I got defamed. Our eyes met and I got defamed. May no woman lose her heart to a heartless, unfeeling man. Our eyes met and I got defamed. Our eyes met and I got defamed. When I turned 16, he said he fell for me. Then he forgot all about me and got another woman. I had no idea he'd ditch me. I had no idea he'd ditch me. I won't marry you. Our eyes met and I got defamed. Our eyes met and I got defamed. I'm prettier than the moon. There's no match for my brilliance. My anklets jingle with the rhythm of the dancing rain. What did I do? I gave you my heart! What did I do? I gave you my heart! You know not what love is. Our eyes met and I got defamed. Our eyes met and I got defamed. I'll see how they marry! Open it or I'll die. Shut up, oldie. Hail Lord Hanuman. May Lord Ram bless you with success and prosperity. Hear me say this. Offer me something in charity and listen to me. Give me your hand and I'll get you married. I was a free bird. The world would sing my praises. Everyone wooed me but I lost my heart to you. You never could be loyal to me. You never could be loyal to me. I'd rather stay away from you. Our eyes met and I got defamed. Our eyes met and I got defamed. May no woman lose her heart to a heartless, unfeeling man. Our eyes met and I got defamed. Our eyes met and I got defamed. Sir, it's time to get married. The priest is calling you. All right. - Come, Ashu. Go ahead, sir. Get up, bride. Sir awaits you. Why are you crying? It's time to unite with your beloved. Smile and go ahead. - Move away. Your mate is dangerous. Beware and go ahead. Bhanwra, you've turned into a singer! I had to. It's your wedding after all. That's great, uncle. You're amazing! I'm not your uncle, but your father. It's getting late. - Get up, Ashu. I won't. Why refuse now? Once you marry him, you'll live in luxury. Shut up! You're stubborn. May I say something, sir? Leave her with me for 2 days. I promise you she'll mend her ways. Then I'll bring her to you. - What non sense! You're a servant. How dare you say that about my fiancé! You're mistaken. I'm trying to help you. Don't forget I'm your master. You rascal! You abused me! You... What are you doing, uncle? Catch him. Beat him up. I dare you... Hail lord Hanuman. Where will you hide? Who wants to fight me now? Very good, Bhanwra. You saved my honour. Else I'd have killed myself. - Dear lord! You better elope with me. Bhanwra, you're like a father to me. Don't touch me. - I'm not your father. Call me your husband. Come, embrace me. I'll feel better. Go embrace your wife. Look who's standing there. Look at you! She's the other woman! - Catch her. Oldie, look at your age. - Forgive me. Shut up. You have no loving words for me. You're singing love ballads for her! She's angry! - Let's go home. Come on! Catch him! Let me go! Wait till we get home. Come on! I beg you. - No! Let me go. - No. Why leave you? Lie down. My name is Premkali. Help! I said lie down. Let me go, mother. Am I your wife or mother? Wait rascal, I'll show you... I'll hammer you. Wait! - Save me from this, mother. I won't spare you. I said come out. Out! What are you doing? Where are you going? Lie down. Leave me. I'll die! I will kill you. I beg you, let me go. I'm a poor man. - Really? Am I not young? Am I not pretty? What's lacking in me? Why do you woo her? You have everything. But I have nothing. You have nothing, is it? I know you well. Lie down. - No. No, I'll die. Lie down. - Fever! I'll treat you right away. Lord! - What? Lord! - Lord! Lord! - What are you doing? Lord! Don't hit me, sir! Spare me. Sir... - You cheat! You're Bhanwar's accomplice. I'll break your other leg too. Leave me! I'm dead! You may go. I'll set him right. Sir! Sir, forgive me. Sir! - Shut up! Rascal! Do I pay you to hit me? Sir, I made a mistake. Hit me if you like. You gave me that intoxicating drink. It made me hit you! Chop off these hands! Punish me severely. I'll go jump in the river. Wait. Where are you going? - Where else, sir? I can't face you anymore. Let me go and die, sir. Where are you going? Listen. I'll forgive you on one condition. - What? Come with me. Don't hit me. No. Come on! Don't push me. - Apologise to Ashu. If she forgives you, I will too. How can a man apologise to a woman? You're a man. Men should never be dishonoured. I can't do this. You will have to, else... I'll do anything for you. Apologise. - Okay, sir. Ma'am! Please forgive me. First say I'm like a daughter to you. How do I explain? Ma'am, understand my plight. Will you forgive me now? Yes. Not like this. Say it with a big smile. I forgive you. Happy, sir? - Very good. Did Ashok say anything before dying? Yes. - What did he say? He said, he'll change his garb and teach Bhagat a lesson! He said that? Sir! - What? There's a ghost in the sack! I told you so. How does he look? He looks like Ashok. See it for yourself. - Go ahead. Go, sir. Let's go, Lote! - Go, Lote! Let's go! Oh dear! - I'm not a ghost! You're a ghost. - I'm not. Trust me, I'm not a ghost. Help me, God. I'll go out! I'm not a ghost. You're a ghost! - I'm not. Ghost! I'm not a ghost, but your husband. My husband? Let me see. Wife! You're not my husband. You're a ghost! - I'm Bhanwra. It's me, your husband! My husband was with me last night. That was Ashok. Did he do things with you? Help me, God. What's wrong, Premkali? Quiet! Where is he? - There. Who are you? - I'm Bhanwra, sir. I was high. Ashok cut my hair and tied me up. That was Ashok? - Yes, sir. That drink got me into trouble. I beg you, sir. I won't drink again. What difference will that make? Lote! - Yes, sir? Don't look at him. Stop them from eloping. Go now! I'm the sun, you're my light. May we be together. I wish your brilliance engulfs me. I'm the sun, you're my light. May we be together. I wish your brilliance engulfs me. My sweetheart is as pretty as the moon. Your path is strewn with stars aplenty. When our eyes met, I lost myself completely. We move away to forget this world. I'm the sun, you're my light. May we be together. I wish your brilliance engulfs me. You're the groom and I'm your bride. I found happiness when I found you. Your love mesmerises me. My life is meaningless without you. We move away to be with each other forever. I'm the sun, you're my light. May we be together. I wish your brilliance engulfs me. Love is in the air and you're a beautiful partner. Take me where you like for I trust you entirely. Any place feels like heaven when you're with me. These joys can't be found in heaven. We move away to live in a world full of love. I'm the sun, you're my light. May we be together. I wish your brilliance engulfs me. Son, people are waiting for you. It's time. We're yet to tie the headdress. What are you wondering? Come on! I'm wondering why Ashok hasn't come yet. He should've come by now. Sir, a letter. It's from Ashok, mom. He's coming with Ashu by Mount Express. That's good. Now you're tension free. Mom, is it okay if we wait for them? Absolutely. Rituals can wait. Shut up! Stop blabbering. Come, Amjad. She doesn't know Allah hasn't made any woman for me. I'm sure about that. Show us your face. Lift your veil. Show us your face. It's your wedding night. Show us your pretty face. Your husband will be thrilled! You can't see her face so easily. Offer her a gift. For now, please go out. She's feeling shy. You're sending me out on my wedding night! All right. Amjad must've gotten married. We're still on the train. What will my friend think of me? Don't worry. He won't think of you with a new wife around. My friend isn't like that. He'll forget his wife, but not me. Yes. Things were different when he wasn't married. He won't be the same now. Want to bet on that? Sir! Disaster has struck. - What? What happened? - I just heard on the radio that Mount Express met with an accident. What non sense? - It's the truth. Ashok! Allah! Nurse. - Yes, sir? It's sinking. Call Dr Joshi. I'll take you to the patient. - Thank you. Excuse me, sir. DrLal wants you immediately. DrLal, you wanted me? Yes, doctor. But it's too late. The patient is no more. Don't worry. Your patient is that way. Sister! Sister! Here he is. Ashok! Ashok! Dr? - He's unconscious. We've operated on him. He hasn't regained consciousness yet. There was a girl with him. Come with me to the office. Don't move this hand a lot. When will I recover? It hurts a lot. Be thankful that you're alive. Many died while others drowned in this accident. Many people are missing. Get some rest. Thank you. Hello, this is DrFarouqi's clinic. What? The doctor has gone to Amjad's place to attend to a serious patient. I don't know when he'll return. Ever since the accident, he's unconscious. Please save him. I'll be grateful for life. You needn't be. A doctor ought to save patients. Come with me. He's in deep shock. When he comes to, don't tell him Asha is no more. Or he'll die. Have faith in Allah. If Asha were alive, he'd have survived. But now... What are you saying, doctor? Have faith in Allah. No! No! This can't be true. This can't be true. God, please save my friend. Kill me in his stead. Kill me! Allah! I'm sure they're here. Think of a way to kill Ashok! Yes. Wait and watch what I do. Let him come. What's the matter? - Is Amjad home? Who are you? - Me? Your name. - I see. My name is Bhagat. Bhagat as in a dubious devotee! What non sense! I was praising you. Don't bother. Inform Amjad I'm Ashok's brother, Bhagat. Ashique, who is this man? It's Bhagat, sir. So, you are Bhagat! Yes. - I'm his assistant. I know that. Ashique. - Yes? I'll call the police. Make sure they don't flee. - Okay. Sir, we're in trouble. Stop him. Wait. Why are you calling the police? Really? If you weren't Ashok's brother, I'd have killed you. You'd better leave from here. Don't ever come back here. I know all about you. You know nothing yet. I'll teach you a lesson too. Let's go. Get lost! If you trouble him, I won't spare you! Please come. Please come. Please come. Please come soon. Please come, my love calls out to you. No one knows my pain. No one knows my pain. Please come. The moon is dull without love. Come, lest you get separated from your love. The moon is dull without love. Come, lest you get separated from your love. Call out to me for my heart is filled with fear. Please come, my love calls out to you. My eyes weep endlessly. No one knows my pain. Ashok! What's this? Amjad, Asha is calling me. Ashu? - Yes, she was singing. Amjad, Ashu is surely in this city. Here's her photo. Where is it? Where's Ashu's photo? Where is it? Amjad, that's her photo. That's her. This is Ashu? - Yes. Why are you amazed? Who wouldn't be? Let's go to your room. Where were you? - My friend was here. Your friend is more important than the patient? You don't deserve to be a nurse. Sorry, sir. - I don't trust you. Collect your dues and leave. - Sorry, sir. Sir. Has ma'am returned from the radio station? I'll check. I'm here. Come, Shabnam. I was waiting for you. Your eyes are deep and misty. Wish I could see them forever. Why were you so eager? I came a little late so you're crying? Shabnam, I love you. I'm sure you love me too. God granted me the greatest joys by sending you in my life. I wish for nothing anymore. Shabnam, people do things for love. If I ask you for a favour, will you agree? I'm willing to die for you. Look at this photo. She looks just like me, except for this mole. Who is she? This is Ashu who died in the accident. Ashok is in a critical state. Doctors opine that he won't survive without Ashu. What do you want? Shabnam, I want you to sport a mole and look after Ashok posing as Ashu. That will save his life. Pose as Ashu? No! I can't do that. You just said you'd die for me. Kill me if you will. You want me to be another man's girlfriend. I'd rather die. You don't have to be his girlfriend. You just have to be a nurse. In doing so, I'll have to befriend a stranger. I can't bear to do that. I'm your wife. - Ashok is my friend. I can't bear to see my friend die in my house. Understand this. If anything happens to Ashok in this house, I won't stay here. You may do as you like. You haven't eaten since morning. I'm not hungry. How long will this go on? I'm not hungry, Shabnam. Until Ashok recovers... - Ashok! Why don't you understand? You have others in your life too. There's someone who left her parents and the whole world for you. What will I do lest something happens to you? I understand everything. Buy you don't understand my pain. People die for their friends. I'm just asking you to be his nurse for a few days, until he's out of danger. Shabnam, I beg you for Ashok's recovery. Say yes and win me forever. I have to serve a stranger to win my husband? Loyal wives do anything for their husbands. Please agree, Shabnam. Do it if you want me to be happy. If your happiness lies in your friend's recovery, I'll try my best to save him. I was sure you'd agree. Allah, what strong friendship! I wish I had such a friend. I guess my prayers are answered. Allah, am I dreaming? Mister! - That voice is familiar. Yes? - Tell ma'am her tailor's here for payment. You don't look like a tailor. What is your name? Honey. - Honey? What a sweet name! I've never tasted pure honey. Don't talk non sense. Convey my message, else I'll hit you! Do you think you'll be the first to hit me? I've been hit many times. Darling, please go. That's like it. Actually, ma'am is unwell. I'll come to Lovers' Park on Sunday and pay your bill. What if you don't turn up? How can I do that? If you don't, I'll come back here. Tata. - Ta-ta. Ta-ta! What more could I ask for in life? A priest has predicted a good year ahead. Awesome! Asha! Ashu! Ashu! Have your medicine. Ashu! Amjad! Amjad! Ashok! What happened? Look, Ashu is here! I'd told you Ashu would never leave me. Never! Give him medicine. I've a call to make. Hello, doctor? Ashok has suffered at attack again. Come soon. - Yes, I'm coming. Chart please? Thank you. Very good. Sit with me. Leave me. - Ashu, sit with me. Oh no! Honey, dear! Where are you going? Where are you going, Honey? Ashique is going crazy! Why sniff the flowers when I am here? - You... Oh my! Don't be so heartless, my dear, lest, I suffer eternally. Shut up, you idiot! Don't abuse, Honey. You're positive, I'm negative. When we unite, we'll ignite a spark and fall in love! Don't come near me. I'll strike you like lightening! Even better. You'll lighten up my world with love. Why do you love me? I'm not that beautiful! That's good. You're like 14 karat gold. If you were prettier, I'd have no chance! Oh you're wonderful! - Really? Dear Honey, I want to marry you. - Why? Dear Honey! Honey darling! Who's that? - That's my husband. Oh no! A lover has been struck down! There's a villain in my love story. Don't bark! - Thank you. What's the matter, darling? Darling, he's in love with me. I'm not! She's lying! - Wait right here. Let me go or my master will scold me. Wait, have some sweets. I'm not hungry. Give them to him! Good bye! Ashu, I'm much better now. That's good. All thanks to you! I've done nothing. Don't say that, Ashu. If it weren't for you, I'd have died long ago. May you face no trouble ever. Why do you seem distant? Talk like you used to earlier. I'm yours, Ashu. All right, have this medicine and rest a while. Rest? I'll feel better if I embrace you. Do you know what I'd do without you? - What? I'd bang my head on the walls and kill myself. Now... What now? - Now, I want to hug you and love you to make up for lost time! Ashu, my heart beats for you. My eyes revere your face. Come, hug me! - Never! I'm leaving. Ashu! Ashu, if you leave, I'll die right here. No! My heart is thirsty for love. How do I explain my heartache? My heart is thirsty for love. How do I explain my heartache? I'm sad and you're aloof. Yet, I yearn for you! My heart is thirsty for love. How do I explain my heartache? I long to embrace you. And you keep shying away. I long to embrace you. And you keep shying away. And you keep shying away. How do I explain my yearning and you're shyness? My heart is thirsty for love. How do I explain my heartache? What do you keep thinking of? What is it that scares you? What do you keep thinking of? What is it that scares you? What is it that scares you? How do I understand why you come close then go away from me? My heart is thirsty for love. How do I explain my heartache? Come into my arms. What is holding you back? Come into my arms. What is holding you back? What is holding you back? How do I bear this apathy? My heart is thirsty for love. How do I explain my heartache? I'm sad and you're aloof. Yet, I yearn for you! My heart is... Is this why you married me? Had you been here, you'd have doubted my character and defamed me! This is too much. I will tell your friend the truth. I will. - You'll say nothing, come hell or high water! You will keep this secret. That's an order. I know it is. Else I would've gouged the eyes of that stranger trying to woo me! I would've chopped the arms of that stranger trying to touch me. You have no idea what I'm going through! I know everything. I've seen your plight. Shabnam, these are testing times for you. If you wish to test me, thrust me into a pit of fire. I won't mind. I can't tolerate any man, other than you, touching me. Shabnam, Ashok doesn't realise what he's doing. But you know everything. It's your duty to handle the situation. I'm going to the doctor. Look after your patient. Yes? Come in, please. Come, Amjad. Please sit. - Thank you. How's Ashok doing? He's better. I thank Allah for saving him. I wanted to know if telling Ashok the truth or if he learns... - Have the fits stopped entirely? No, he gets them sometimes. Then you need to be cautious. These fits can kill him. Don't tell him anything now. Continue with the medicines. All right. Thank you, doctor. Hello? Yes? DrFarouque speaking. Yes, I see. Ashok! The doctor has asked you to eat well so... What's wrong? You better not ask, Amjad. Tell me. What's the matter? What do I say? Wonder what's wrong with Ashu. She doesn't look at me lovingly anymore. My heart aches thinking about the past. I'm yearning to embrace her. She might've forgotten things after the accident. Or she may be worried given your illness. Recover soon. Things will be fine. Let's go out. You'll feel better in fresh air. Amjad, let's take Ashu along. Of course. Get up. Amjad, who's prettier? Ashu or Shabnam? Let me take a look. Hey, look away. Don't stare at my love. Nothing will happen to her beauty. The mole will ward off all evil. Amjad, it makes me go crazy. She'd get angry and I'd appease her. The promises we made to each other... We promised to live and die together. Ashu, do you remember? How long will I keep talking? Say something. Amjad, I don't like this city of yours. Why? Ashu has gone silent here. Ashu, say something. Else, my friend will think you're mute. Look, he's laughing. Ashu, say something. Forgive me. - Done. At last she spoke. Now you ought to sing. No! Not done, Ashok. You begin singing. Ashu will follow you. Okay, Ashu? Darling, look around. The nature reminds us of our love. My heart reminisces watching the snow around. My heart reminisces while it snows. Old wounds of love have been reopened. Old wounds of love have been reopened. My heart reminisces... Those were beautiful days when I lived in your heart. Those were beautiful days when I lived in your heart. And you'd embrace me lovingly. These games you play seem to be killing me. Old wounds of love have been reopened. My heart reminisces while it snows. Such is the fate of hearts aching with love. Such is the fate of hearts aching with love. Love is about burning with melancholy. It's a world full of woes. Old wounds of love have been reopened. My heart reminisces while it snows. I'm the forlorn lover yearning for my beloved. I'm the forlorn lover yearning for my beloved. I weep silently for my sweetheart. I fear lest I hurt my love. Old wounds of love have been reopened. My heart reminisces while it snows. My heart reminisces... Why did you keep quiet? Smile. We're here for your sake. Indeed, you are. But... What? I am expecting love from a soul who knows not love. This is the limit! You're so lost you're lighting a cigarette that is lit! Useless things should be burnt. What do you mean? I'm simply adding to your troubles while you're being a true friend. The one with a friend like you is the most blessed soul. Very nice. Where did you learn those lines? Are you mad at me? - Yes. Say it directly. Why talk in riddles? What's the matter? Depends how serious you think the matter is. Riddles again! You'll surely kill me. What's the matter? Why did you send Shabnam away? Oh dear! Such a silly matter. I forgot to tell you that her mother is ill. She has gone to check on her. She doesn't have much to do here anyway. I know that. Tomorrow's your birthday. Shabnam ought to be here. If I knew her place, I'd go fetch her. Why should you? I'll ask Ashique to fetch her. Don't you trust me? Perhaps. How do I trust a friend like you? Doubting your friend's character is like doubting a brother and sister! I was kidding. Shabnam will be here. No, Amjad can't do that. Never. Ashok, you mustn't think he'll take advantage of your illness. You're wrong. May I say something? - What? Tomorrow's your birthday and no preparations are made. I'd heard you begin your birthday celebrations a week in advance. As if you take birth every day for 8 days! Forgive me, have you changed the schedule this year? Meaning. - It' simple. No sweets have... I won't celebrate this year. - Why? This is your first birthday after our marriage. We'll celebrate for your sake. Ashique, order for double the amounts of sweets. We'll celebrate my friend's recovery too. We won't get such a chance again. - Okay, sir. I'll make such arrangements that you'll be thrilled with joy! When will the programme begin? Amjad is missing! Ashu. Hurry up, Ashu. You too are calling me Ashu? You go. I won't come. Don't get angry, darling. One gets angry only with near and dear ones. Am I a stranger to you? You're not. But I am forlorn. Don't say that, Shabnam. Why not? I am a woman. How long can I stay away from you? We're physically apart. But our hearts are one. My heart aches. I alone know what I am going through. Shabnam, I'm also helpless. But I don't complain. I face tribulations with a smile. While I cry for love. You're like dew drops that comfort a soul. Come along. Today I won't be Ashu, but Shabnam. I'll wish you as Shabnam. If you want to wish me as Shabnam, you'd better not come. Friends, I'm saddened to say this. There will be no music today. - Why? Music will surely be played. Ashu, what's this? It's my friend's birthday and you're still here! I'm not feeling well. What's wrong? I feel dizzy. I'll faint. All our friends are waiting. Come on! Listen up, Ashu will sing for us all. In fact, she will dance as well. I've no complaints that you left me forlorn. I was fated to be lost in love. I'm happy I gave you my heart. I gave you my heart. I got rewarded for being in love. I got rewarded for being in love. I'm happy I gave you my heart. I gave you my heart. I got rewarded for being in love. I got rewarded for being in love. Forget me if you will. But please smile today. Forget me if you will. But please smile today. Fill my path with stars aplenty and brighten my nights. My heart has blossomed with love. My heart has blossomed. I got rewarded for being in love. I got rewarded for being in love. I'm happy... I'm eternally grateful that I can be around you. I'm eternally grateful that I can be around you. I couldn't win your heart. I've lost in this game of love.' All I pray is for your wellbeing. I pray. I got rewarded for being in love. I got rewarded for being in love. I'm happy... All I wish is for passion to rise. May our lips meet and all talking cease. All I wish is for passion to rise. May our lips meet and all talking cease. May no one come between us today. May we revel in deep love. Hold me in your arms... I won't hear a thing. You shouldn't have done that. Forgive me. I made a mistake. I was lost in your love when I fell in your lap. Your emotions have spoilt everything. You think I don't love you? I swear upon God, you're dearer than life. My heart beats for you. You alone live in my heart. Darling, I'm doing this for friendship's sake. What a great friend you are! Shameless rascal! No man would do this to a friend. You'd said you'd leave your wife but not your friend. Now I know you were lying. Don't you dare touch him! What do you know about friendship? Depraved, vile woman! If I knew you'd change colours on coming here, I'd have killed you long ago. If I knew you'd come between us, I'd have given you poison, not medicines! - Quiet! Don't say that to my friend. I'm guilty, Ashok. Punish me as you like. But don't say that I'm not your friend. You still call yourself my friend? You've tarnished the pure relation of friendship. I'm leaving. I pray, may you live long and burn in the fire of guilt. May the world curse you and may you die lonely. No, Ashok. Don't go... - Go away! Shabnam! Shabnam! Daddy! - My dear! Shabnam! - Daddy! Shabnam! Why are you crying? Why are you in this state? What do I tell you, daddy? Is she Shabnam? What are you looking at? This is my daughter, Shabnam. She's Shabnam! Where is Ashu? How do you know Ashu? I'll tell you later. Where is Ashu? I had twins, Ashu and Shabnam. Shabnam doesn't know about this. 20 years ago, I was a forest officer. One day, Ashu wandered off in the jungle. We still haven't found her. Have you seen her? Where is she? I too am looking for her. Shabnam, where is Ashu? Ashu died in the train accident. She died? Why did you pose as Ashu? To save your life. The doctor said if you learn of her death, you'll surely die. Amjad couldn't bear it. He compelled me to pose as Ashu. Oh God! Oh God! What have I done? I wish I'd died before accusing Amjad! Why didn't I die? What are you doing? Amjad! Where's Amjad? - Amjad! Amjad! Where is he? 'Shabnam, if Ashok learns of Ashu's death,' 'he'll surely die.' 'Before my dear friend dies,' 'I want to end my life.' - Amjad! Lote, look! - Yes? Ashok and Ashu are coming. Our target is here. Amjad is there! Wait, Amjad! Wait here. I'll go there. Hold this. Amjad! Amjad! Ashok! Where will you go? Get in. - Leave me. Get in. - Let me go. Let me go. - Get in. Ashok! Leave me. Leave me. Leave me. Leave me. - Sit quietly. Leave me. Sit. Let me go. Leave me. Let me go. Let me go. Leave me. Leave me. Leave me. How will you flee? Let me go. Leave me. Leave me. - Come on! Where are you taking me? Leave me. Come with me. Leave me. Leave me. Let me go. - Come on! Let me go. Leave me. Let me go. Lote, tie him up. You wanted to call the police, right? Let's see if the police can save you - Amjad! Leave me. Where are you going? Come with me. - I won't. Let her go. I said leave her. Wait right there. If you come closer, I'll jump and take her along. Wait! Let her go. Leave her or I'll chop you into pieces. I won't. I'll die with her in tow. I'll kill you both. Move, Amjad! Ashok, what did you do? My end is near. Be with me, Amjad. With my friend beside me, I'll die in peace. Don't say that, Ashok. Why would God snatch my dear friend from me? I'm going, Amjad. If you do, my world will be dark. I can't live without you. Amjad, a million like me will be born. But an angel like you and a pious woman like Shabnam are rare. Shabnam, forgive me. Amjad, forgive me. - No... No, Ashok. I won't let you go. Amjad... Amjad, Ashu is calling me. Ashu! I'm coming, Ashu! Please come, my love calls out to you. My eyes weep endlessly. Ashu!I’m coming, Ashu! – No one knows my pain. No one knows my pain. Please come, my love calls out to you. My eyes weep endlessly. No one knows my pain.
