Women in love are ugly. Actually, I'm a "Hello! Project" geek! I've bought a breast massager! But it's useless! Before I turn 30, I found the way not to hurt myself. Being thought of as a nuisance was easier. To be honest, like a child, I wish I could be with you. "Rent a Friend" Eri Tokunaga Atsushi Hashimoto Sumire Ashina Tomoko Nozaki Kana Yamada Ms. Mochizuki! - Finally! - Sorry for being late. - You are late. - Thank you for waiting. Let's go. I'm getting nervous. We can't go home before some rich men hit on us. - Now I feel like going home. - You can't. I helped you with your news coverage, right? Our website really likes such an event. - I wanna go home! - Follow me." - Is your office near here? - Yes. I'm a regular here. - Me too. - So we may have already met here. - What is your job? - I'll leave you to wonder. - Here's your drink. - Thank you. That's "Ginza's Corridor Gai"! Many guys speak to me. How about that guy? He is a hottie. What's important is not looks but social status. The two of them you introduced me to... had made love on impulse. So they are disqualified. But they say they are just friends. No! I'm searching... more pure friendship between a man and a woman. But sex doesn't matter to young people today. It matters to your generation only, doesn't it? My generation... I lost one of my playing cards. Did you see near here? No, I didn't. I'm not sure, but I think... it is in here, right? I can't believe it! See? Thank you. Let me return the favor, please draw a card. Draw the one and I'll buy you a drink. Try it! Komoto CPA Office? I'm Komoto. Thanks for a drink! Thanks for a drink... Yuri! For example, a sudden call from someone... - Mr. Komoto, let's get a drink. - Get a drink... it's a good idea. We'll be right back. You have no need to be nice to me like her. You don't want chatting up. You think so? Do you like cherries? - Yes. - Take this. Do you think... men and women can be friends? That's sudden. Well, I think they can be. - Really? - Yes. Because I have the switch. - Switch? - I use it to remain just a friend. So I think men and women can be friends. What is it? Excuse me. Oh, I got it. No problem. Have a good night. What's wrong? They went to one more place. Really? What is she doing... And I'll go home soon. - Really? - Thanks for tonight. I'm Nasa Mochizuki. May I have your... - I'm Yanase. - Mr. Yanase. Wanna know more about the switch. May I have your phone number? Sure. I'm going this way. - Good night. - You too. I really wanted to know you more. I can't come up with anything more. May I have some? Sure. The switch to remain just a friend. Say what? How do you feel about a man who has it? It's boring. What? Because you can't control who you get a crush on. That's the crush, isn't it? If we can control, that is... real love? That's so cheesy! Here you are. Cheers! Not enough. I need to make my planning paper catchier. Don't be so serious. As I'm a working adult. Working adult... That sounds tough. So are you? I said goodbye, though, my tears never stop. Memories of when I hurt you come back to me. Nights without you. If it's a dream, I wanna awake right now. If I forget you someday, I wish I'd never met you. Good morning... hey! I'm sorry for last night. That's ok. So what happened after that? - It's a long story. - What? Listen please. What happened? After we're alone, our conversation didn't become lively. So... I asked him many questions and he had a sinking. Finally, he confessed that his companion was a Rental Friend to hit on women. Rental Friend? He's just a nerd. That turned me off. Anyway, that's crazy! Actually, he seemed to serve as a foil. "Yanase left the chat." Where did he rent a friend? - I don't know. - Ask Komoto! - Are you fascinated by him? - I wanna cover his activity. I'm Kandagawa. I emailed you just before. Mr. Yanase works for your company, doesn't he? I wanna rent him this time too. So I'll pay for that by bank transfer today. Thanks for your time. Ms. Abe. I have an idea that you'll like. - Tell me. - "Rental Friend is just a friend?" - By Shizuka Kandagawa. - Rental... You're catching on. Rent him and verify... It's a running story. Before in serial form... Just this once, give it a try. Thank you. Good afternoon. - Thank you for your time. - Not at all. Are you Nasa? You have a good memory. - Sorry to surprise you. - It's ok. You already knew my business. I found out later. As you left the chat. Sorry. It's the rule. No problem at all. I'd like to know more about your job as well as the switch. Why? I wanna become a novelist and write about the friendship between a man and a woman. Can I interview you? In that case, you can. I'm so glad. What should we do today? In such a residential area? I've wanted to go there. You always go alone? I have no one to go with. I see. That's it! It'd be nicer to look at from far away. - Can I go there? - Sure. Here is the best place. I've seen an old water-tower in Kagoshima before. Near Chiran Peace Museum? You're well informed. It was leaning. Leaning? How much? It's about this? You're tall, so you look like a water-tower. I've never been told that. Say. Let's go out together again, shall we? Of course. I also work as a Freelance Friend, so you can make a contract with me. Freelance Friend? Tell me more about it. You have two options. One is the One-Day Contract. The other is the Monthly Contract, which means 15 hours to use. Monthly... The Monthly is a better deal than the One-Day. It depends on what you want. There're many places I wanna go... No rush. Sorry for talking about that. Not at all. - Could you do me a favor? - Sure. If you could be just my friend like today, I choose the Monthly Contract. If you are ok with me. Rental Friend is just a friend? By Shizuka Kandagawa. One day, the man who was just my friend said "All female friends are potential girlfriends." Have you ever been confessed his love by just your male friend? In today's world, there is such a job. Rental Friend. And I found a suitable man who said he has the switch to remain just a friend. I rent him and verify... Can a man and a woman be just friends? Rental Friend is a real professional. The basics of contact are "defense," but he is good at "offence" too. So I named him "Libero." I was mistaken about Rental Friend. Like how? It's not for only someone who is alone. Feeling accepted unconditionally... That's nice. That's helpful for me, too. So cool! Great! I'm glad you liked it. Now I remember. Before I forget... - Here you are. - Ok, two hours. If your client is a woman, does she wanna act like a real couple? It happens sometimes. You have mixed feelings? I avoid being alone with in the room and never come to love my clients. Because it's my job. - Professional! - No need to praise me. If either of the two has feelings, they are not friends. But with a Rental Friend, it's never gonna happen. Never gonna lead to trouble. Awesome! - Guess what? - Are you already drunk? Do I have to be a success? Pouring too much! Anyone wanna be popular? That's not what I want. I know how you feel. What's up? One of my former students showed up at today's party. She said she'll make her debut soon. She was surrounded by her entourages and followers and seemed to live in a shining world. I see. That's all. I drank too much. You can not sleep here. Tamaki. You must not sleep here. Go to bed. Take off your jacket. Good night. You will catch a cold. How long are we going to continue like this? We'll be turning 30 soon anyway. The more I look at, the more you look like that. What do you mean? It's the utmost praise. Let's get a picture! Say cheese! - Gimme a smile! - This is my utmost smile. Say cheese! What's up? Very much alike. Especially the curves of your neck? The No.1 article of last week is "Rental Friend is just a friend?" Well done. And it received 20 comments. "Can't wait to read the next!" Anyone wanna know if money can buy friendships? - Let's keep moving on. - Yes. - I have a suggestion. - Which is?" Change his name "Libero" into "Rental-kun" in order to be simpler. - Sounds good. So cute. - It is! So proceed with it. Let me think about it, will you? Sorry for that... Our relationship is very systematic. Choose where to go, meet up there and part there. My monthly card is a token of friendship! But "Done" is just not ok... "Done" Lastly, "I hope to hear from you soon." I hope to hear from you soon. If I don't call "Rental-kun," our relationship will end. The more I rent him, the more memories memories memories we make. Only I wanna see him again? Don't throw a wet blanket. No worries. If only I have the card, we could be just friends! "Nicer to look at from far away" That's how I make the best use of my Rental Friend. Just this once. I never usually do. "1. Women-only" "2. Don't eat without asking" Let me use your kitchen knife. Go ahead. Is that your roommate's piano? Yes. When she and her ex-boyfriend lived together here, they made songs with that. I finally got it. So you sleep on futon. Just I'm a futon person. Eat this, take medicine, and sleep. Thank you. Eat this and sleep. Honestly, I'm making songs, too. So do you? Can I play now? Sure, go ahead. This apple is good. Repetitively I start dancing day by day. And I start singing. Nice to meet you. Here is women-only, you know? Because Nasa said she is sick in bed with cold... Just kidding! You are the Friend, right? Now you're playing ad-lib? Because I'm making songs, too. I'm Sota Yanase. Tamaki Ono. Nice to meet you. It's time. Sorry for playing without leave. Never mind. It was... fun. Nasa. Did you fall asleep? Give me a sec. This is my CD. Just try when you have time. Thank you. Please take care of Nasa. Sure. What's up? Sleep more. I'm afraid of making you have a cold. It's not a big deal. But I'm afraid. Before Mr. Yanase went home, he told you to get well soon. I got it. I thought your performance was pretty good. Why don't you ask him to make your song? You think so? It depends on him. But I hope he will. Good night. You too. I just wanna keep gazing at that stack. Nasa is short. So you love something tall. It doesn't matter, does it? Actually, I'm thinking of asking Ms. Ono to sing my song. Sounds good. Let her do. I thought you'd be more surprised. She's too truthful despite her talent. Talent is one thing and popularity is another. I think making songs alone is not for her. Now I hold a ceremony to keep us being friends. Please listen. Sure, but what? Actually, I'm a "Hello! Project" geek! I've bought a breast massager! But it's useless! Most of my seasonings are expired! Always I kill my plants! I've checked my boyfriend's phone twice! Good at unlocking! I wanna get married someday. But... what a pain! That's all! My secrets I can never tell someone I love! No problem. That's rather cute. My sister is more terrible. Is she? Why you said "what a pain"? I was thinking about marrying at 26. But I realized only love wasn't enough to marry. You checked his phone? That's right. Finally, he demanded that I pay him for the wedding rings. Good thing, you didn't marry him. Actually... my sister rented a Father to walk the aisle with. - Rented a Father? - My parents got divorced and her in-lows knew that. So they must have got confused. They got divorced soon after all. She is something. Despite a Rental Father, I was glad that our Father was there. Because of that, I knew this job. Your job is helpful for people. You may be right. I've never told about this. How can I say... Thank you. What? You're good! In elementary school, everyday I played soccer with boys. There were girls like that. So I'm confident of playing better than ordinary men! Deprive me of the ball! Alright! Excuse me, but that ball is... - I'm sorry. - Never mind. - You're good. - Thank you. - He was staring at us? - I don't know. It smells! Oh, my bad. Who is calling? Hello? Yes, I'm Ono. Oh, it's you. Thank you for the other day. You listened to my CD? I'm so glad. But I've not been able to play lately. My schedule? From the day after tomorrow I'm free. We can use a music studio in my school. See you then. Nasa! Listen! Yanase? How do you know? Listen. He seems to like my demo and wanna make songs with me. That's great. As you can't work hard when you're alone. Good luck. Thanks. "I've seen it in the film" "Let's go there" This is the song which I hummed before, isn't it? That's right. - Now, sing it. - Sure. Day after day, repetitively I play a role. Now I remember my lines. Hurry to speak those. I'm feeling rushed. I take a look back on songs, mistakes I've made, and changing cities. But now I start dancing, somehow. Thank you. How do you like it? Naturally, it's better than my demo version. I'm confident of only singing. Your article's getting more page views. - And it's gone viral in social media. - Exactly. I'm gonna finish writing the next post soon. You can expand the topic more. How about staying overnight together in a hotel? What?? If we spend a whole night, nothing gonna happen? That must be the core of your article. I can't. - You're 30. Don't play innocent. - I'm 29! Our sales in this term depend on you. I'm counting on you. Seriously? Why don't we take a break there? Something wrong. Golly, I've never been to a place like that. You wanna pop into? It doesn't feel right. Just for once! No worries! I won't do anything you don't like! No way! My feet ache! I'm feeling very weak. Let's take a break there... What the hell I'm doing. - Sorry for asking too much. - I'm used to it now. - Come in. - Thank you for having me. I was just making a song. What do you wanna see? Please make a song as usual. Have a seat here. Thank you. Before we start. Two hours. Have you heard about us from Tamaki? Yes. So I thought I had to cover this story, too. I want two of you to do your best. I see. That's fine. Now in progress. I press this key and it makes a bass sound. And beats are made in the same way. Now you can hear like this. - Does that make sense to you? - Yes. For example, now I add an organ line to this track. And a Synth. If I delete these beats and add another beats, it sounds bit different. What time is the last train? It's about time. I'd better go now. Thanks for going over time. - I'll walk you to the station? - No thanks. I learned a lot today. - Thank you so much. - Take care. Good night. - Hello? - It's me. - What's up? - Maybe I left my cellphone. - Come on! Just a sec. - I'm so sorry. - Let's look for it. - Sure. Thanks for having me. I hope it's here. Where is it... I found it! You missed the last train? Oh, indeed... what should I do? If possible... So sorry, but just this time! Can I stay at your place? I know it's impossible. Sure. - Are you sure? - Then, you can sleep in bed. Never mind! I'm a futon person! Take a shower if you want. Shower... thank you. Use these. Just this hoodie is enough. The bath felt so good. You have work tomorrow, too. Sleep early. How can I pay for tonight? Well, you don't have to. - Are you sure? - Yes. This zipper always gets stuck. Can I turn off the light? Sure. Yanase. - What? - About the switch. Have you... ever turned the switch off? That's how it is with switches. It happens, you know. I see. Nasa. I have a question for you. What? Will you write about tonight? On your website "Rental-kun" is about me? You had a reservation under "Shizuka Kandagawa." It's not a novel, isn't it? No, it is not. His sister taught him "what a woman is." Thanks to that, he is a Siscon! That's novelist! Great insight! Because my boss always tells me to exaggerate the story... That's all there is to it. - And she told you to come here. - No, I mean... What do you wanna do? What do you mean? If Romantic Relationship fits better with it, I don't mind. If you are ok with me. - Are you kidding? - No. I see. Ok. Let's give it a shot to know what we can do and can't. What will we do? Hold hands and kiss... Then, have sex. How far can we stay friends? Alright. Let's hold hands. How do you feel? It doesn't bother me Then let me kiss you. Sure. How do you feel? Then, have sex? If you wanna do so. You must be stupid! Sorry. How stupid can I be... So sorry for lying. I'm going home for today. But how? I'll manage to. Though I like, I say "dislike." Though I feel sad, I say "fine." Words are not just Symbols. "Words are pretending to be Symbols" I should not rent him for a while. Clean up the meeting room. What's going on with him? I don't write about him anymore. What the hell? I'm just so tired of writing in an amusing way. Please ask someone else to write. Come on. It's not your self-chosen study. It's your job. Be professional. Finish the job by next week. Men and women might not be able to be friends. Just a normal conclusion. It's boring. Everybody feels the same anyway. Everybody feels the same? If so, everbody can write the same story, right? You said you wanted to write this. Take your responsibilities seriously. If you're not desperate to find something, it's good for nothing. Tamaki Ono "Somehow" Day after day, repetitively I play a role. Now I remember my lines. Hurry to speak those. I'm feeling rushed. "NOW PLAYING" "Tamaki Ono Somehow" I take a look back on songs, mistakes I've made, and changing cities. But now I start dancing, somehow. Somehow I start dancing... I bet. Somehow I start dancing... I bet. Excuse me. Pardon me. I'm Yanase. - Nice to meet you. - You, too. What should we do today There's a spot I wanted to go. Where is it? - That way. - Fine. Here we go. Is Nasa busy recently? I don't think so. - Is that so? - Yeah. Will you still continue your current work? For a while. I can't make a living as a musician. But there are many other jobs only to earn money, right? Rental Friend is not only that. Is that so? - I'm home. - Welcome back. Listened to the radio and felt somewhat uncomfortable. Absolutely. This is for you. From Sota. Thank you. Nasa. What do you think of Sota? I make nothing of him. Just a person to be covered. What's going on? Perhaps, I might love him. That's unexpected. Is he your type? Maybe it's because we're making songs together. I never learn, right? "Monthly" "It's about time to renew the contract" "Call me soon" Sweet snacks? - Don't open! - Let me try some. Give it back! Don't get excited. That's so scary! I kissed Yanase. Say what? By accident. We tried it to know how far we can stay friends. What's that? He can do anything to make clients happy. Still, you love him? Why did you have to say that? It doesn't make sense. You love Sota, don't you? - No, I don't. - How come? Because he's a Rental Friend? He's just my friend. What's the difference to you? Is it because you are making songs with him together? Are you mocking me? You said "I regret" "having made songs with my boyfriend." You haven't changed a bit! I just said - "I 'might' love him." - What makes you say that!? At least, you have Music. I love both music and him! About music, I want to aim higher. I'm not satisfied with where I am! "Though words are intended for use," "it's hard to use them properly" You look older, right? Are you serious? Your hormones are making you so. Have "Rental-kun" calm you down. That's all his fault anyway. I can't think of any good sentences! Any other episode? Another side of him, not as a Rental Friend... He's making songs with my friend. With your real-life friend? Write about it! I'll help you. - No thank you. - You're not interested? I think every woman is attracted by the different side of a man. Please make an appointment with him. Does he still remember me? I couldn't talk with him much then. - "Yanase" "Words are not Symbols, similar, though" "There are different ways to interpret a word" What genre of song does he make? "Similar to music" May I come in? Come on in. - Go on playing. - Sorry. Thanks for waiting. Sorry to interrupt you. Is this a good time to interview? What would you like to know? Didn't she tell you? For the extra story of her article... I haven't heard anything. You know what she's writing, right? Now we wanna cover your music activities. I wish you'd not write about it. What should we do? Could you tell me why? You think my article is too vulgar? I didn't mean that. What's the difference between music and Rental Friend? A little difference. Could you be more specific? About music, songs are made by me. Rental Friend is made by others. Which means, "Rental-kun" is made by her, right? Sorry, I'm leaving now. - Come on! - That may be true. "Adjust oneself to each client." That's my rule. Then, what made you start making songs? Because I wanted to know myself. Why did you want to know yourself? I hated myself for pretending to care what others thought. But clients admired my work. So I think Rental Friend matches me. I got it. Which means, when I was with you that's not just the way you were, was it? If so, why did you kiss me then? Did you take my words literally? Even if it's not true I wanted you to make me think we're friends. Then, Sota. If I ask you to kiss me, will you really do? I won't kiss you. How come you won't kiss her? She sings a song on the stage. I just make a song for her. So I won't... stand on the same stage. Making songs together... it's similar to being in love in terms of showing true colors. Needless to say, I respect Sota. And I like him for sure. But that's not Love. I just... I just sing a song made by him. That's all. I see. That sounds great. On the other hand, I have nothing going for me. That's not true, Nasa. You have... You have Words. Though anybody can use words, I believe that there are words which only you can use. Words which only I can use... "Words are not" "Symbols, similar, though" "There are different ways" "to interpret a word" If that is similar to music... now I want... I want to understand two of you properly. So Could you write the lyrics to the song which we're making now? Though I said "I'll try", that's not an easy task. I work day and night and write the lyrics after work. What's my own self-expression? Something I know and wanna know more... I may change "give it a try" to "trying our best." "Trying our best"... Thank you for waiting. Thanks. I wanna see only the upside of it. I wanna know, I don't wanna know... So selfish. I intend to listen to you but always I only care about myself. That is enough. I don't wish for anything more. I gaze at you from far away. Just because I wanna join you. You're busy turning the switch on and off. Both you and I are trying our best. That is enough. That is enough. Thus I could share Music with them by writing the lyrics. I thought finally I would come to be like they were. But actually, I don't know yet. But I know... I'll never forget her singing voice. "Try to find my own answer." That came to mind. Here you are. This is the last time I rent you. Won't you renew the contract? No, I won't. I see. To be honest, seriously, I want to write a novel. What is it about? How to surpass feelings of love. Surpass... Not just friends or lovers. But it's an ever-lasting relationship. Kind of that? I wanna write a novel. So can I interview you? Of course. In that case, you can. As the rental period is over, please return to your real self. I was not always pretending. Listen. What? Can I test you one last time? Will you be my girlfriend? I never ever say "Yes." That's fine.
