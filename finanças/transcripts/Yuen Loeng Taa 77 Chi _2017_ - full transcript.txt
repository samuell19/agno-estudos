Hi! This is Eva, I'm not available to answer your call right now. Leave a message if you like. - Move! - No. - Move! - No! - C'mon! - Back off! C'mon, man! Back off! Go back! Hi! This is Eva, I'm not available to answer your call right now. Leave a message if you like. Go, yeah, right! Cheating! Great! He scored? Bribery! He scored? He really scored! It's got to be fixed! Fxxk, got to take a leak, man! Been holding it for too long. Don't piss all over the place. My wife freaked out for days because you did last time. - How about I piss on you? - Stop that! Where's your girlfriend? Dunno! "Gone Girl"? My wife's favourite, it's mine! It's better that she's not home. Otherwise she'd keep nagging me for ignoring her because of the game. Actually Eva... is not bad at all. She always makes us something to eat when we're here. I got it now, there's also Manchester United... What's wrong with this chesterfield, man? It's sticking out. Shorten it, man! Why don't you watch it instead. Manchester United versus Arsenal is next. Let's stay for that, too. You must be kidding. I'm starving. Eva's isn't in, there's nothing to eat here. Dude. No more beer. I'll go get some. You don't say, man! Hurry, Adam! It's on very soon. Hi! This is Eva, I'm not available to answer your call right now. Leave a message if you like. Hello? The voicemail is full, Please call again later. Do you know about Eva? They broke up! What? They really did? Is it official? I helped her to move out. She's staying with me now. Quiet. Hello! What're we gonna eat? I've booked the Rooftop, it's serving a Financial Set Lunch. Wait! Ladies and gentlemen! Do you have a minute? You girls go first. Let's go. Do you really want to break up with me? Well, my closet is empty, where do you think my clothes are? We're grown-ups. Can you make it clear if you really want to break up with me? Yes! We're grown-ups, so there's no need to spell everything out. I don't understand Check your Whatsapp! "We're finished." Your husband made a will before his death, listing all the inheritors of his properties, but... he didn't... put you or your dog on it. I beg your pardon? I'm telling you, we got married in Las Vegas. See. My husband is dead, why isn't his stuff all mine now? It depends on whether he has a will and where he got married. First, marriage laws in Las Vegas aren't the same as in Hong Kong. Second, there's no guarantee for a divorcee to inherit anything. What? So the old fart lied to me? Ms Lui, you must help me to get justice! In fact, it's hard to define justice when it comes to love. But when we face the law, the family doing what the deceased wanted is most appropriate. What kind of lawyer are you? I hired you to help me fight for the estate, and this is what you suggest? You're fired! Save it! Leave it to the part-time maid. All right! I don't want to take advantage of you. Why didn't you move back 10 your mom's? I don't want her to worry. Anyhow, I have to be able to control my own feelings first... before hers. One at a time, I'll move back when I'm ready. OK! OK! What happened? It can't be anything good. Take a look for yourself. He changes partners... more often than you get a new phone. He also gets a new phone more often than you change your partners. See how fast he has recovered. C'mon, take a look! No! Take it away. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to Mandy! Happy birthday to you! Coach! Have a piece of cake! Thanks. A new phone. It's your birthday, you should eat it. I'd like you to eat. Thanks. "LI... am SINGLE now." Wait... What the fxxk... Shit! I get it. How long do you want to stay here? I do the cooking and the dishes here. That saves you from hiring a maid. I heard that you were a lawyer, why... are you here teaching kick-boxing? OK! Another drink! Eggs Benedict... is what you like. How do you know? I have followed you in facebook. Is that right? My birthday wish came true! Well... good for you! You didn't add me on facebook. I don't add my students. I can quit immediately. I used to be a dental assistant. One of those standing beside the dentist? One of those who helps to suck patients' saliva day and night. I grew up in public housing with my parents. Ain't rich. Didn't do well in school. But I know what I want in life. You have a better life than me then. Actually, you already seemed to be a very cool guy to me before I found out you were a lawyer. I believe in love at first sight. Sorry about last night. Do you regret it? Do you know why I went to bed with you? Because I knew you were unhappy. I hope to make you happy. I have classes today. Aren't you going to work? I quit my job. I don't want to look into patients' mouths every day. Your eyes are red. I forgot to take my lenses out! "How many heartbreaks until you know love is really over?" "The First Time: I hate people being late," "especially for a movie." Where are you? You know I hate people being late, and you're late for a movie! Sorry, its raining. There is traffic jam. Hurry! Take your time. Different notebooks are designed for different people. Our idea is to guide people to truly face themselves. On every page, there's a quotation inspired by our heartbeats as well as a photo taken with a shutter. Plus your experience from time to time. It's a notebook for listening to your heart. But where would I find time to write Haven't you ever written down what you feel? Sometimes I type a line or two to post on facebook. Writing isn't the same as typing. Handwriting is unique for everyone. Writing with your hand is unique and organic. I don't think I'm the artistic type. Thanks. By the way, why 77 times? Why not 33 or 99 times? A short version is that forgiving him 7 times is far from enough, 70 x 7 times is too much. I think a normal patient person is able to forgive someone for hurting him 77 times. Is there a long version? 18:22, Gospel of Matthew... OK, I get it, I get it. Since you're so inquisitive, this is free for you. You can't do that! I'll buy it. Will you? You're my first customer then. Really? I'll buy it for sure. I'll wrap it for you. No, no need! When you write down what you feel, sometimes it can really help you to make important decisions. Sorry! You don't know how bad the traffic is over there. Still writing? Let's go! Go where? We've missed half of the movie already. Watch the next show then. That's the only show for today. I bought the tickets last week! Check out on other movies then. No! Standing here makes me very tired. I want to go home. What? Didn't I say sorry? Why aren't you ever late for a football game? You never change. Don't be like that! The traffic is always bad in the rain. I always ask you to leave home early, but you never leave until the very last minute. You never make plans for anything. Are you OK? OK! Isn't this chesterfield too long? How's this? Is it OK? I know you like white I went to many places before I found this Do you like it? Yes! It's hard to keep clean though. What? You don't like it then? No, I do! Who says I don't? I know you want to please me. Give me a cheerful smile. Is that all? It can go in a little more. That's it? It's sticking out so much. Didn't you make measurements first? Well, it's a bit too long. Not just a bit. We'll bump into it. You're always like that. Big deal! Just go buy another one. It'd be a waste of money. What do you want me to do then? I want you to be a bit more practical. It's not just this couch, I'm talking about the way you live your life! You've often avoided your law firm in the past 6 months. My parents forced me to study law. You know how much I hate my dad, don't you? But you must grow up. Can't you be a bit more mature? Alright! I promise you I'll take life seriously. I'll take my work seriously, too. But, I must enjoy what I'm doing first, OK? Before you begin a job you'd enjoy, you must let me know first. OK. Not here! Why not? This is a white chesterfield. We'll stain it. Can't you wait? Shit! OK, good! One, two. Strike! OK, breathe in, breathe out! Breathe out, breathe out! "I'm waiting for you." "Be home as soon as I can." "Supper?” “"I'll cook.” Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to my dear. Happy birthday to you. Happy Birthday! Thank you. Hold on a second! Make a wish first. Yeah, right! I forgot about it. One second, OK. OK. Take the candles away. OK. One moment. For you. Do you want me to open it now? Yes! What is this? My heart! Thank you! Won't you open it? More? Of course! I designed it. C'mon! It's so... neatly folded. I'm pretty sure you'll be touched. You've always said I'm impractical. This present is for your future. No... for our future. It's... really practical. 1 TB icloud storage. I think... the way I feel now... is as excited as walking in a cloud... Really? Yes! This package is so worthwhile. It's only $78 per Tb a month. So one big payment gets us 10 worry-free years. We can store a lot of photos, too. Raisin cookies? You know I don't like raisins. Don't you know that by now? That's easy! I'll take the raisins out. Don't bother. I do remember you like grapes. I like grapes, but not raisins. Same as I like apples, but not apple pies. It's really hard to remember... such logic. You studied law, you were trained to remember things. I eat fruit, but not processed fruit. Then why do you eat chocolate? Why not just cocoa beans? There's no point in talking to you. What do you feel like eating? I'll go get it! Happy Anniversary! Sorry! I really forgot the anniversary of our first date was today. It's alright, I didn't expect you to. Your mom just passed away, you must be very sad. You're the best girlfriend in the world. Now you know? I've got something to tell you. I have a feeling that I won't like it. I quit. Quit what? My job. Have changed to teaching... kick-boxing. What? Kick-boxing? I really can't take this. I'm not freaking out, I'm not freaking out, I'm not freaking out. Don't say that! I'm not freaking out, but your dad will. I told him two weeks ago. Two weeks ago? So again, you didn't discuss it with me first. Would you let me quit if I did? Yes, I would, if you did! But you wouldn't let me scold my dad. Scolding your dad and quitting your job are two different things. But how could I work with a man I hate so much? Your dad divorced your mom, but he still loves you a lot. He wouldn't have divorced Mom if he loved me. No job will suit someone like you for too long. I don't want to talk to you any more. My parents forced me to study law. Now that Mom is gone, I don't want to feel wronged any more. On top of that, there are so many hypocritical things going on in the firm. So many of them, so many unjust things. All those people care about is money. But not me, I just can't. Mr. Chang! You always get very upset when you have a row with your dad. I don't know why you still want to do that. Adam is staying out late again. He drinks with his friends day and night, and drives drunk. It's raining out there now. "The Sixteenth Time" How can I not worry? How hard could it be to call you or send a message? Yeah, how hard could it be? Do you expect him to call and lie to you while he's fooling around in Ian Kwai Fong? No! That's not it. Don't you understand? I'm upset not because of he makes me worry. It's because I can't help him with his problems. Apparently he's trying to run away from his problems. What can you do to help him? I just want him to be safe and happy, that's all. What if... he's in bed with another girl now? Well... it's still better than getting killed in a drunk-driving crash. OMG! Why must you be so high-minded? I wouldn't say a word if he came in the door now. Who are you? Are you OK? Eva. Eva. My headache is killing me! Mr. NT Tang was born here, he's an indigenous resident of Hong Kong. He enrolled in an international baccalaureate diploma program in Holland at 16... and brought back a university degree. At 25, he inherited a piece of land in the northeast New Territories. According to the Land Registry, it's about 20 hectares. Also, this is his fourth divorce. Something to drink? What do I need to know? Mr. Tang has always had a Marital Settlement Agreement. But for this marriage, Mrs. Tang has hired the lawyer who prepared the Agreement for their divorce. So Mr. Tang must hire Hong Kong's most capable divorce barrister to handle his case, that's... you, boss. Mr. Tang has arrived. Mr. Pak, my boss, Mr. NT Tang. Please take a seat, Mr. Tang. Eva Lui, Mr. Tang, how do you do? How do you do? Call me NT. It so happens that Eva and I went to the same law school. Fate... it's fate. Cat was my classmate in university, too. OK, shall we start? Time is precious. First of all, I want to make sure that... you signed a prenuptial agreement with your wife. Is that correct, Mr. Tang? Yes! I signed one for every marriage. But I made 10 times more... after I married this woman, which means she'll ask for more. I mean my present wife will soon become my ex-wife. By law, she is still your wife at this moment. Yes! Under the same roof. Big house, you know! I don't want to give too much to my present wife. Because if I do, all my ex-wives will come back for more. I don't want to set a bad example. Do you understand? But I am not at all stingy. I'm willing to give plenty to my wife. Your wife's appetite is... pretty big, Mr. Tang. The amount she's asking for is enough for you to divorce 4 more times. Getting a prenuptial agreement is like getting a vaccination. It costs some money. But prevention is better than cure. Our clauses are known to be flawless, they don't allow the receiving party to play any tricks at all. So please come back to us for your next divorce. I certainly will! Give me a discount, won't you? Professional service means you get what you pay for. Do you know... she really looks like my... First love? like my mom. As thin as her. She died of cervical cancer. Didn't she get a vaccination for cervical cancer? Men can get one, too. Eva! Yes, Mr. Tang? I said call me NT! New Territories. I love Hong Kong. I love my motherland. OK, NT. What don't you eat? I beg your pardon? There's always something that women don't like to eat. All my wives are like that. Raisins! OK, I'll make a reservation. Go make a reservation. Lunch with Bondy, I'll see my boss off first. Your boyfriend spent 10 grand to get you cloud storage. Buy me one, too. For that price I can get a 1 karat or a 1½ karat cubic zirconia. Well, we should get real diamond rings, man! For my engagement. Enough! Must you rub salt and pepper into my wound, girls! OK, no joking, serious. After our wedding banquet in Hong Kong, Benjamin and I will go look for a beautiful castle in the UK... to have another party for his family and Cambridge classmates As for you girls, you'll all be invited, too. Plane tickets and accommodation are on me! Thank you! Is your break-up for real? Then I won't invite that Adam, whoever he is. Stop pushing her. She might ask us for compensation. No, no! Anyway, from this moment on, I have no feelings for him. Hope you mean what you say. Let me tell you what. Adam approached me... before he got you. But there were so many men chasing me back then. And I knew you were interested in him. So I just shut him out. Save it, man! You thought all the boys at the university were going after you. It's my turn now. You, too? Your Adam was definitely not a gentleman. He never offered to drive me home whenever I visited you. She lives just across the street. Get up! It's so late now. She's by herself. By the time I start my car, she could've walked home already. Forget it then! I'll take her home myself. OK, OK! I'll take her home, but don't make me drive. That ain't enough to disqualify him. In fact... One floor up. Welcome! I saw Adam with a girl last year. What? On their way to a movie. What girl? Why didn't you tell me? They weren't hand in hand. Benefit of the doubt attributable to the defendant. Besides, I did tell them about that. You two knew about that? What are friends for, eh? You didn't tell me about it. Cut the crap! Love is already gone. Let the new replace the old. Moreover, my boss likes you so much. Don't talk about him. It's not possible. OK, back to business. Eat less and keep yourself fit in the next few days. Because the bridesmaid and maid of honor dresses arrive tomorrow. Can I not wear a dress? You can wear nothing! Stop that! People are watching. Good news! The opposite party has promised... to let you have half of the house. I sacrificed so much in the last 30 years to get him where he is now. We started our business on the street with no license. Then we moved to Mongkok, somewhere upstairs. Here, there, everywhere, now we end up in IFC. It ain't easy at all. Your husband's solicitor has an offer for you. You can be the sole owner of the house. He wants to compensate me. Oh no! Does he want me to forgive him? There's one proviso with this offer. You are not to mention that female artist's name to anyone anymore. Especially to the media. It's her again! It's always about her. Ms Lui, I have suffered for 30 years, 30 years isn't a short time. That woman... It isn't the house that I want. I want a family! I know, I know. But there's no promise for love. But I think one must work hard seeking true love to make his life worthwhile. Hello? I'll be 15 minutes late, sorry! It's alright, hurry up! OK, bye! "Keep searching, you'll find the person you are looking for." Thank God, there you are. Sorry! I'm not that late, am I? It's OK! Let me take a pee first. I can't believe I found it. Found what? That shop folded, but I found it on line. I don't know what you're talking about! C'mon, I'm bursting. OK, OK! Good evening! Welcome! Thank you. Chang, please! Mr. Chang has arrived. Let's go! Are we meeting someone here? You should've told me to dress up. It's just my dad's birthday. I nearly forgot it myself. May I help you? They're here already. Thank you. Happy Birthday! Thank you! Why are you so late? My time management is always bad. Mandy, my girlfriend. Uncle, auntie. But this woman isn't my biological mother. Cheers! Cheers! - Happy Birthday. - Thank you. Enjoy. Thanks. What do you do for a living, Mandy? I worked in a dental clinic... Are you a dentist? She sits beside the dentist to suck out patients' saliva. The dentist can't do anything without her, she's very important. Where's Eva? We broke up. Why's that? Do you really want to mention my ex-girlfriend in front of my new girlfriend? You want to embarrass me, don't you? Your dad is just concerned about you, Adam. Then I'm concerned why you divorced Mom and married this woman! Adam! Also, I've always wanted to know what made my Mom so depressed and got cancer? Don't say that! You planned to ruin our birthday gathering, didn't you? I don't think I could. I'd need to be really selfish to do so. Enough! I've got good news for you. I'm planning to marry this lady, Mandy, who I met just 3 days ago. Take your time! You've wanted to provoke your dad for a long time, right? Yes! So do you feel relieved and happy now? Yes! How happy? Actually, I'm not as happy as expected. Your ex-girlfriend was right. You shouldn't have provoked your dad like that. Even you want to mention her? How do you know what she said to me? I just guessed. Your dad likes her a lot. Well, I couldn't have graduated... without her. You like her a lot, too. That's why you couldn't provoke your dad like that before. Because she didn't let you. She's gone. Are you really gonna marry me? Why not? These letters are for Eva. I found them when cleaning up the room. It's all junk mail. Shall I write "No such person” and throw them back in a mailbox? I'll forward them to her tomorrow! Thanks. "When you don't care if your lover is at the dining table,” "your love is just leftover."” Yes? Daisy wants to remind you about tonight. 7-30 at the Panorama, a surprise will be waiting for you. She surprises me every day. A job promotion, purchase of a new car or a condo... or a celebration for her new cool guy. Whatever, don't be late, and dress up. Still writing? Let's go in! Chinese lettuce... Beef... pork... Are you nuts or what! Moron! Don't get irritated! I have the right of way, don't I? Why do you get so annoyed whenever we go to my parents' for supper? I'm not. I know you don't like my family. I don't dislike your family. I just don't know what to say to them. Well, learn about them. Listen to what they say! What difference would it make? We still have to spend the Winter Solstice with your family. Don't forget we spent the Winter Solstice with your mom twice. I didn't complain about that. I have a mother, too. My mom was all alone by herself. That's why I compromised with you. You compromised with me? My mom had cancer, shouldn't we have spent more time with her? Now that your mom is gone. That's why I suggested we turn around to visit my mom. I don't understand why you look so annoyed? I'm not! Aren't you? If I was, you would only see it when your dad was boasting. Your mom said that about him, too, remember? Why don't you just listen to him a bit? There's freedom of speech in Hong Kong! He has a history of heart trouble and high blood-pressure! Don't provoke him! OK, OK! When I look agitated, just kick me under the table to remind me, OK? Mom! Auntie. There you are. C'mon in! Dad. Uncle. Keep dozing! OK, I can help. I'll get them, OK. Sit! Ok. The water is boiling. More water. Mom. Not again! I have enough! Lunar New Year is coming, you need money for food and red packets. I still have the red packet you gave me last year. Go get yourself some new clothes then. I'm old, my clothes are all over the place. Then go to a beauty parlour or join a tour. I'll save it for you, let me know when you need it back. The BMC television station has owed its employees their pay cheques for more than 20 days. That's the case, that's the case! I got a fare from IFC to the airport today. The passenger was amazed by what I said about that. He said I was insightful, didn't really want me to stop. How can such a big corporation be short of cash to pay its employees? Something must be going on. What kind of social group is that, man! Getting paid for doing nothing! Are they out of their mind or what? Do your job but don't drag us in, for heaven's sake! A taxi driver like me is always most clear. What do we civilians want? A secure and steady life! Most Hong Kongers agree with that, don't you think? No, I don't, and I disagree. Why did you change the channel? Those people keep reporting the same news, and you keep commenting on the same news. I have to listen to you boasting all night. Good shot! Offside! Offside! Offside! No, how could he be offside? The guy in red, anyone could see that. The ball wasn't passed to the forward. And the forward wanted to turn back anyway, how could he go offside? I ain't talking about the forward... What? He doesn't know what offside means. This player was offside! According to Wikipedia, whether a player is in an offside position is contingent upon 2 conditions. First is the position of the ball, second, the position of the striker. When a striker controlling the ball is closer to the goal line than a defender, you can call him offside. Wikipedia says so. You can't live without Wikipedia and your mobile, can you? But I live with my eyes open, my eyes told me he was offside. The referee just missed it, period! The referee's decision is always final. There were so many fans in the ground, if the referee was wrong, they would've complained, wouldn't they? Did anybody in the ground jeer at him, nobody! Why did you turn it off? We seldom get together for supper. Can't we just chat a little? You can chat with your daughter every night if she moves back home. The radish is delicious, Auntie. I didn't see you eat any radish. Don't be so phony, for god's sake! Even if I am, it's because I care about how people feel. Unlike those male chauvinist pigs, patronizing because they are old, headstrong and pervasive. Eva, tell your boyfriend that the word should be "perverse". Improve your vocabulary first! Why can't you just save your mouth for eating? Shall I get some herbal rubbing alcohol? No, you know I hate the smell. Why didn't you save your breath at supper, then? I'm a professional lawyer. Refuting bullshit is instinctive. May I ask where you practice your instinct? It's perfectly all right to have supper with your mom. I just can't stand your dad. You know that's the way he is. It wasn't the first time you met him. Where are you going? To get something to eat! I only had a slice of radish for supper. It's so late now, where can you go? "Love is journey you frequently get lost." The GPS is not responding. Isn't my phone working? Use the map! What's the name of the inn where that... Yasujiro Ozu stayed before? Chigasaki-Kan. Well... what is it in Chinese? Let me see! Alleyways and back lanes are all over the place in this neighbourhood. I don't know which way to go. Where are we? This is a residential area. Is that "Kan" something really somewhere here? Go that way! No! We must go the right way, we can't guess our way. We can't find our way by instinct. No! I asked the man at the gas station. He said it's by the seaside. When did you ask him? When you were in the washroom. Let's go! What now? You never planned for our trip, you never change. You leave everything to me, I make mistakes sometimes. But that man said so! Is he right for sure? Why don't you trust me? Because you're not a dependable witness! What's the matter with you, for god's sake? You're always late, forgetful. No plan, no sense of security. Why do you still stick around if I'm so bad? I'm going my way now! Go! Which way did you say? That way! Hey! Hey! Is Eva here? Eva? My girlfriend is lost, her name is Eva. I'm sorry, I don't know. Is he your boyfriend? Thank you! Thank you! I was worried about you. Your phone wasn't on, and there was only 1 tick on your Whatsapp. Sorry, my phone batteries are low. Why didn't you come and find me? I did! I turned around to look for you right away. But you were gone already. I nearly got lost myself. Finally, Adam and I managed to check into the room where Yasujiro Ozu created his work. My wish of all those years came true. It's too early to get up! Get some more sleep. I am worried you might disappear again. What are writing so early in the morning? I'm not telling you. - Please... - You must be Ms Eva? Yes! Hello! I must've come to the wrong place, sorry! No, no! You're in the right place, the place I booked for our date. It's good to see you're punctual, it's not 8 pm yet. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, sit down. 8 pm? What is it? ? Well, you don't love Hong Kong enough. Is most enjoyable when watched crossing the harbour from the Kowloon side. We are now on Hong Kong Island. That's right! So what is there to watch? I've made it ready. 54,3, 2,1 Eva, I've been waiting... I've been waiting for a girl like you. I really love Hong Kong. But honestly, I'm a Dutch passport holder. I love the English language, too. I used to know only the past, present, and future tenses. Not until after I met you, did I learn what the "present perfect continuous tense" is. Together, I hope our future will be perfect and continuous. Mr. Kwok is on the line! Hi, Kwok! Very successful, indeed! Very beautiful! Quite beautiful! OK, OK! Thank you! OK, OK, OK... Well, , shall we? Didn't you say it's best to watch it from the Kowloon side? Well, you don't love Kowloon enough. My helicopter is standing by to take us to the Peninsula. How about returning here for dinner after ? You really love Hong Kong, don't you? But I love you even more. My dress got caught. Actually... I'm not ready. Not ready? We're gonna miss the show. No! I've just broken up with my boyfriend. That means you're available now. But... my boyfriend and I were together for more than 10 years. I mean the way I am now isn't fit to start a new relationship. I don't mind, I haven't got divorced yet. That's right, so you aren't ready either. I see, so you do mind. OK! Why don't you process my divorce quickly. And I'll ask you to marry me as soon as it's done. There you are! C'mon in, good girl! I'll take them in. It's OK! Let me do it! Go in! Supper is ready. In fact, married or not, a relationship will work out as long as the couple are frank and patient with each other. Well then, do you remember how many times you've been patient with Dad? It's too long ago to remember. But I don't want a relationship like yours. Crying in the kitchen day and night. Women are born to suffer. A woman can suffer alone and stay with her mother. A woman unable to marry is to be pitied. How could I have you if I didn't get married? Let's eat! Sorry! I still love her. So what? We can still get married. I really love you. Marriage isn't a plaything. We marry first, and then divorce when we're tired of each other. I'm serious. I've been wasting quite a bit of your time. I want to stop. Do you understand? I asked to join you in your life. I'll try my best to make it up to you. Your ex-girlfriend was right. A man like you, the more generous you seem, the more selfish you are. Are you OK? Go in! Be careful! Don't puke, please! Get him a cup of green tea. OK, OK, you guys get going, leave him to me. - Are you OK or not? - OK! - We're leaving! - OK. Bye! Hello? Mom? What happened? Don't cry, what's wrong? Adam. Hey! Wake up! Wake up! My dad has had an accident! Hey! What am I to do? What am I to do? What am I gonna do? I want you to know that Eva's dad always hoped his daughter would meet a good man. He wanted grandchildren. I always reminded him that it's all predestined. We must respect our daughter. Let her make the choice. I knew he disliked me. No, he didn't. I only worry who will take care of Eva when I am gone, too. I have plans, Auntie. I'll count on you then. My daughter is a good girl. Cherish the girl you love. A girl's youth is limited. Please take good care of her. I beg you. No need, please! I'll take good care of her, I promise you. Don't worry. "The Seventy-seventh (Time)" Hello? Hello? Who's this? This is Adam, Mandy I have nothing to say to you! Please don't hang up on me. What have we got left to talk about? I just want to ask you one thing. That notebook. Do you have the last page. It was gone when I turned to it. Why don't you just ask Eva? Give her a call, coward! To someone who cares, a free copy of 77 Heartbreaks sent to you by mail. Until we meet again. I can explain further if you wish, Mr. Lai. Listen! At first that woman and I agreed just to love but not to marry each other. Then she forced me to. I said getting married is OK, but no kids. Again, she forced me to. All right, having kids is OK, but I hate bringing up kids. This time, she's forcing me to support the kid until he turns 18. Why don't you just tell the judge that she has been forcing me in all circumstances. Don't hold me accountable for anything. In that case, may I ask what a woman must do to force a man to marry her and have kids? She threatened to break up with me if there was no marriage. No kids, no sex. The judge might say no one could stop you from breaking up or having no sex! How is it possible? I'm a man! The paternity report confirms that you are the father of that child. So you must accept your responsibility. Then why must I support his mother, too? You have to look after the 9 children from your 3 previous marriages already. Do you think you still have time for this one? As a matter of fact, the alimony your wife is asking is very reasonable. Do you understand how hard it is for a man to bring up 9 children? Well, it isn't part of the law whether a couple should use birth control though. "Arrived." Macaroons. Thanks. "I've arrived, too." "Where?" "At the table next to yours." I hope you don't mind. Because I think I should record this moment. Where's Heartbeat Shutter? She can't come. I'm Shutter! Heartbeat and Shutter are 2 people? Heartbeat is my sister, she wrote the quotes. I take photos, so I'm Shutter. Thanks so much for being Heartbeat Shutter's first customer. Thank you. The photos you took are full of emotion. Thank you. I've got something for your sister, too. I saw her riding a motorbike on facebook. "I've got you a little gift, you helped me to make a very important decision.” Thank you. But I can't send it to her for you. "I broke up with my boyfriend." "A person must work hard seeking true love to make his life worthwhile." "I used this gqoute, too."” But we chatted on-line all day today. It was me, sorry. Actually, I was going to go back to the shop to close the "Heartbeart Shutter" account on facebook. And you message came at the moment I wanted to click that button. It was natural to reply, I don't know why. "7:00 pm tonight?" After that I began to think. "Be there or be square.” It should stay that way. "Heartbeat Shutter” was my sister's idea. It's part of our creative lives. It's also a proof that she once existed in this world. Therefore I decided to keep the account. But I didn't expect that someone would need a listener so much. I also thought what will happen to my facebook account when I die? I don't think my family would know how to handle it. It could get screwed up by strangers. Other than existing on facebook, a person lives in many people's minds, too. You're right, I guess. Like I will always remember my dad. I remember while my sister and I were designing there was one thing we argued a lot about. I never thought it was decent to record unpleasant experiences. Because they are already written in here! Put it in a tissue before you throw it away. What? Didn't you wear one? There's none left! I can't believe you! Don't you know that this will make me worry for quite some time. Haven't you just finished your period? It's been a week, for heaven's sake! I'll marry you if you get pregnant. You behave like a child, how could I marry you? Let's watch this one tonight, OK? It's crap, the female lead is a joke. Did you watch it? No! No? Where did you get that comment from then? My friend watched it. Which one? What? It was Francis! A relationship comes to a halt without trust, I think. But saying goodbye is very difficult. Especially when forgiving him has become a habit. Auntie. There you are, finally! May I see Eva? Yes! One moment. By the way, where are you going next? We're not going the same way. So where are you going? I'm taking a night flight back to the States. We are going the same way. Cos our planet is round! I can't believe there's still traffic jam at this time of the evening. You should've left earlier. I wanted to know the end of your story first. I really did. See how cute Daisy's wedding invitation is! Didn't you say 60% of cases are divorces in your law firm? Look at my parents. Getting married is the first step to getting a divorce. Yes! Yes! Yes! Why did you pursue me then? Because I love you! And will for as long as 50 years. Oh, boy! Oh, boy! That means I can't get married for the next 50 years. Do you really want to discuss our 50-year plan in a traffic jam like this? I'm sorry! It's all right, I'll take the next flight. There's always a next flight. Do you want anything to drink? So, what's happening to them? Not much. How much is not much? Why does the good couple hate each other's guts now? I don't know, I can't quite follow the story. Then why were you grinning? What are you talking about? What message amused you so much? What message? I said something to you from the kitchen, you didn't hear me. A student notified me of the time, that's all. I haven't seen you so amused for ages. Stop imagining things, OK? Why don't you read the message yourself? No! What do you want? Why must you get me wrong? I wanted to show you the message, you refused! A student's birthday is coming, his friends are holding a party for him. One of them notified me of the time. It has got to be a she, younger than me, sweeter than me, bigger boobs than me. You're crazy! Why don't you believe me? I wish I could! That means there's nothing more I can say, right? - Eva? - Yes? You stayed out all night last night, where were you? I'll tell you later, I'm a bridesmaid today, in a rush! Hey! Do you know who was here yesterday? Who? It was Adam! What did he want? OK! OK! Thank you, Auntie. What happened to your head? Sorry, I... You jerk! Don't think you can get away with what you did to my daughter. Leave! How dare you push my daughter around! I married a low-class husband. But I gave birth to a high-calibre daughter. All right! Aren't you going to the wedding? Remember, you'll be the prettiest. As pretty as you! Certainly! Now I pronounce you husband and wife. Congratulations! The kiss is too long! Time to toss the bouquet. It's a chance of a lifetime to kiss your love in front of so many people... and hear so much applause. Hey, remember! Give me the bouquet once you grab it, 500 bucks! A thousand! Two thousand. What's all this about? I'm not the one to toss it! Have 2 pieces of music ready, fade in and out. OK! Hey! Bouquet toss. Girls at that table, move to the front. Eva, Cat, Bondy, c'mon! Hurry! Ready to toss! Is everybody here? Everybody? Over here! Over here! Here it goes! OK! One, two! Wait! There's one thing I forgot. Before I toss my bouquet, I want to tell all my besties that in the past year, and for many years in the past, we forged a profound friendship. Although I'm the lucky one, none of you is jealous of me. At least you haven't let it out, which proves my world is full of true love. Only the female lead in a Harlequin romance novel or in a film deserves such a perfect wedding. Thank you! OK! OK! Ready! One! Two! Three! Sell it to me, $2000. $2000, man! Why does he want it? Boss! I'd like to bridge the gap between us. What are you doing? Put me down! Help! What's all this about? What's going on, Mr. Tang? Eva. You were really efficient. I am divorced now, and eligible to ask you to marry me. Is this so romantic that you don't know what to say? OK, make it more romantic! Will you marry me? You're crazy! Love drives me crazy. Will you marry me? Let go of my dress! What's this? It isn't on the rundown for Mr. Tang. Today is the annual Talent Quest of the University of Hong Kong. Standing on the stage here, at this moment, whether or not I lose isn't important. I just want to take this opportunity to make the following song a gift to a woman who is of the utmost importance to me. She knows what she means to me. She is among you. "Once upon a time, there was a girl." "The girl was Eva, the boy was Adam." "Little did they know, when they met," "They" changed into "We". What are you doing? Photo taking! For future use. "The first time we held hands." "The first time I sent her flowers." For you! "The first time we took the ferry." "The first time she spent her birthday with me."” Bye! Be careful! "The first time we went to work." "The first time I met her parents.” Come stand behind me, Dad! This is awesome, man! "Our first car." "First X'mas at home." Stop that for now, get this done first! It's not finished yet! Go away! Go away! "Our recent photo... what comes after that?" Eva. Sorry! I don't know how to take care of you. I don't deserve your love either. Because I don't even know how to love myself. One day I read a love story. The boyfriend in the story was selfish, spoiled, childish, lacked discipline, and was irresponsible. He was nothing but a villain. And I never realized that I was the villain. I read this story a million times. Yet something I still don't understand. How could the girl manage to love the villain for so many years? Why did the girl shed so many tears for the villain? The villain hurt the girl many times, why did the girl forgive him many times in return? I thought about it for a very long time. A very long time. Finally, I had an epiphany. It was because the girl couldn't bear to leave him. She knew that if she did, the villain's world would fall apart. And now, I, Adam Cheung Chi Si, wish to tell the whole world that it was you, Eva Lui Wai Sum, who taught me... Just the word "love"! What makes it so hard for you to say it? "Love", man! What love is! Eva. I swear to God, the love I'm going to give you will be more than enough to mend the 77 heartbreaks of yours. I hope you can forgive me for the very last time. Forgive him! Be good! Get up first! Not if you don't forgive me. Get up! Hey! What about me? I knelt first! I knelt longer! Buy up his whole family! (Fix him!) Just a second. What? One second! Welcome home! Where's the white chesterfield? I'm going back to the firm on Monday. My dad was very happy. Actually, whether or not you're a lawyer makes no difference. I just don't want you to make your dad angry. OK, I'll be nicer to your mom each day. I won't be late for movies. I won't drink and drive, or buy raisin cookies. I won't do anything recorded in this notebook. Please believe me. Is this hurting you a lot? I'll go get a towel, you get the ice. You closed the file. Now you have re-opened it. You asked for it! What's the matter? I left the notebook on purpose for you to read. I think that girl left this thing on purpose for me, too. No! I was very confused back then. - I never felt for her. - Stop following me! My wife wants a divorce. Lawyers out there must've prepared her for an estate fight. As the top barrister for divorce in town, how can I lose this court battle? What would my clients think of me if I lost? Neither can I appoint myself to file a lawsuit. I know, one doctor only makes work for another. Damn right! I'm skilled at my profession, but I'm not a vegetable, I have feelings like anybody. We met in high school. We went through a lot together. It really hurts! I remember she was in her uniform in school. What a Tinker Bell she was! The worst thing that happened to me was that... prenuptial agreements weren't in yet when we got married. If you want, I could be your solicitor. I still love her a lot I remember the first time I held her hand, the first time I kissed her. And then our first son was born. All right, you are my solicitor, I trust you. You were my student, my student is saving my ass now. May I ask you a question, Master? 20%, that's my best offer to her. 20% of something is better than 100% of nothing. No! I meant to ask you if you still love your wife, why did you send so many messages to those... To whom? To those women! I didn't! You men always grin when answering that kind of message. I can tell right away. I am telling you, spying on someone sending messages is unethical. Ethical! That's not why we're getting divorced. What's the reason then? She found another man! She said she hadn't loved me for years. She said she couldn't stand me any longer. Another man! It wasn't because of those messages. What're you talking about? Bondy! Bondy! Where are you? I'm here already. "Lovers are like macaroons," "no matter what flavour, they are all sweet." "I'll never forget the warmth of your laughter and tears.” "Forgive him/her, 77 times."
