Dentist. Sandra? Could you come in for a moment, please? I just wanted to check where the windows in my schedule were today. - Windows? - And? With the exception of the wrinklies... - Sandra. - Senior-citizens. Your day is a huge vista of wraparound glass. Oh, right! Hang on, though, and this is exciting. - Two o'clock, Gorgeous George. - No, you canceled him. He canceled the cancellation. No, I'm too busy, the wrinklies... You didn't put the dentist off. - I like my dentist. - Why don't you like George? He's got a degree in arts administration, which is on a par with media studies and dog walking. What are they doing in there? Rehearsing a new number for the Best of Broadway routine. Well they shouldn't be, we can't afford it.

Perhaps a little more heartfelt in the last chorus? - Yeah. - Yeah, okay. Boys, I know it's early, but don't you feel the backing is a bit, how shall we say? Undercharged? A bit like we don't really care? But we don't really care, the song is drivel. The song, Larry, you cynical oaf, is not drivel. It happens to be first act closer of Cleopatra, which happens to be the hottest ticket on the Great White Way. Does the audience bother coming back for act two? Oh, for God's sake. Julian, can I have a word? All right, darlings, take five. Take 15! The season finishes this week. Why are we rehearsing new songs? Well, the kids are fed up with Rogers and Hammerstein. I suspect the audience is, too. Some of them come back three or four times, and The Farmer and the Cowman with four girls, two boys and a comedy magician is short changing them. All very noble, but the overtime? - The kids won't charge any. - Well, the band will. Well, if it's that desperate, I'll pay the band myself! Don't worry, I'll raid the pensioner's lunch club. Good afternoon, Mr. Grey. - Hi, how are ya, how's the family? - Fine, thank you. Good, good. All right, girls? Behaving yourselves? That makes a change. Hi, Norman! Come and take the weight off your feet, Norman. Norman: No thanks, Mrs. Craske. Just checking that you're being looked after. Oh, of course. We might as well move in here! Do you know, we've seen the show three times, and we're coming again on Saturday. - Not bored with it, then? - No fear. It's a treat, every time. Not too much Rogers and Hammerstein? Hey, you can never have too much Rogers and Hammerstein. Mrs. Craske: He's right. So you wouldn't want anything new? - Modern musicals, poppy stuff? - Oh, I didn't say that. You've gotta keep up with the times, I say. You're never too old, eh, girls? Shall we? You'll need another drink, if you're meeting young George, from the council. Cedric, can you explain to me how it is that every bugger in this town seems to know what I'm doing before I do? Because you're a public figure, Norman. And there's not a lot else to talk about. Mind you, if there was anything else to talk about, I doubt you'd get a second thought.

Where have you been? George is here. Have you been drinking? What a ridiculous suggestion. Sorry to keep you, George. Affairs of state. What are you gonna do with that thing, film me, tape me, or fumigate the office? I finally managed to decipher the returns for the last three years. Your box office staff have no idea how to use a computer. How on earth do you keep track of year on statistics? All up here, George, all up here. That's not protocol, Norman, you can't be held accountable if the correct systems aren't in place. The girls in the box office... Now know how to prepare a proper spreadsheet. - Hoorah, so I won't have to. - On the contrary... Look, I can work my mobile phone, I can program the video, I can operate my washing machine, that's quite enough technical achievement for a man of my age. That's something else we need to talk about. - What, my washing machine? - Your age. Oh, putting me out to grass, are ya? No, I mean... No, but if you can't, or won't embrace the 21st century, the council are under no obligation to continue supporting you indefinitely. I rather assumed it was the theater, and the people who enjoy using it that the council was supporting. You know, those pesky ratepayers? - Oh, yes, of course. - I'm just the manager. Although, of course, if it would be nice to think that after 43 years of loyal service... You're deliberately misunderstanding me. I understand you only too well. Please take a look at these figures. Perhaps then you'll understand why there are certain factions in the council who are gravely concerned. George, we should all be gravely concerned about global warming, international terrorism, third world starvation, but grave concern about the Pavilion Theater? Let's keep this in perspective, shall we? As you wish. Goodbye, Norman. Sandra. You have been drinking. I had a couple of beers, it's not against the law. Anyway, you shouldn't have been listening. You were broadcasting to the nation. What was all that toffee about global warming? I was making a simple, rational point. And I shall do the same. I'm taking the rest of the day off.

But I'll have a coffee. How was the meeting, then? Apparently, I'm senile and computer illiterate. Oh, he's a perceptive chap. Well, that does that make you, then? I admit my age and I can work a computer. It's all right for you, you've got nothing else to do. Oh, hoity toity! You won't have anything else to do, if they get rid of ya. No, it's, it's just gossip. What's gossip? You know, about these commercial producers coming in to run the theater. Oh that, no, Laura wouldn't allow it. Hey, never trust an attractive menopausal woman. - You old chauvinist. - I'm proud of it. You watch yourself, because I reckon that she and young Comerford are plotting something. Cedric, you could spin a conspiracy theory out of a church picnic. Laura's a chum. And, to be fair, George is only doing his job. You're getting more and more like your father. He couldn't bear to think the worst of anybody. Fat lot of good it did him. Well done! Good initiative! How did you persuade Mr. Whipit? I simply explained that an organic fair trade operation was benefiting customer choice. They were happy with that? - Perfectly. - Good! No more ice cream wars, then. I hardly think... When Fresh Farm Ices tried to muscle in on Mr. Whipit's patch, they ended up with their tires slashed, the van sprayed with slurry and a dead seagull in the freezer. Then there was the healthy smoothie incident. Still, I'm sure you've got it all under control. Now, was there anything else? Yes. The theater. We have a problem. Strictly speaking, of course, you have a problem. What's happened? Well, that's the problem, nothing's happened. Rome wasn't built in a day. Rome... Never mind. Presumably you haven't raised the question - of an outside producer, then? - I've tried! But it's useless talking to the man. He doesn't understand the principles of good governance. Well, they sold out again this summer. That's pretty good governance. He refuses to accept that, despite selling out, the theater is in trouble. He won't even learn how to use a computer. Says "it's all up here." Well, it probably is! Doesn't want to be bothered with computers at his age. - Exactly. - What? His age. If he won't comply with standard accounting procedures, perhaps it's time to find someone who will. I'm not having you shove Norman out before he's ready. You can't have it both ways, Laura. Do you want to bring in a commercial producer, or don't you? Well, that's what the council intends to do. But we have to tread carefully. Why? Why is everyone so keen to protect poor Norman? Because he's one of the good guys, so was his father, and I dare say his grandfather, too. Look, maybe you can find a way to ease this in gradually. Have a think about the winter. The place hardly functions then. Now, I must fly. It's time for me to bring some good governance to the wheelie bin deficit. So, he says, "I've just run over this rabbit." He says, "That's not a rabbit, that's a hare!" Takes an aerosol can out of his bag and he sprays it all over the hare, and it jumps straight up. And runs down the road, turns round and waves to them. Runs a bit more, turns round and waves. Runs a bit further, again it waves. The driver says, "Well, it's a good job you're a vet." He says, "I'm not a vet, I'm a hairdresser." He says, "What's that you sprayed it with?" He said, "Oh, that was a hair revitalizer", "with a permanent wave!" All right. Larry, take it away! And now, ladies and gentlemen, we come to the moment that we've all been dreading. This, the very last spectacular of the season, must end. I'd like to arrange a meeting, at your earliest convenience. Splendid idea. All those involved in making this the most successful show to date! Are you coming to the party? Our wonderful backstage staff! Party? Larry and his scintillating band! Cast and crew. Come and meet everyone, let your hair down. The boys and girls of the ensemble who worked so hard and so cheerfully. Thank you, but I don't really think that's appropriate. - Shh! - Our star guest... It doesn't have to be appropriate, it's a party. - I'm inviting ya. - And of course, me. Yes, well, perhaps for a short time. I'm only joking, but don't let's forget the man who makes it all possible. Ladies and gentlemen, your very special theater manager, Norman! Come on up, Norman! Take a bow! Don't be shy. So, finally, ladies and gentlemen, from all of us to all of you, our lovely audience, thanks a million and see you all next year! And remember, folks, we don't do it for us.

Mr. Comerford, are you enjoying yourself? Yes, yes, thanks. You should be dancing. I'm sure the girls will appreciate it. Oh, no, I mean, no, I don't really do dancing and things like that. I hope you do some things like that. Life would be awfully boring if you didn't. Everybody seems so... Jolly? Jolly! Yes. They're quite normal, you know, they're just young people having a few drinks and a good time. Tomorrow they'll be off and they probably won't work again till Christmas panto, if they're lucky. So, it's nice that they can be jolly, don't you think? Yes, I hadn't really thought about it like that. Is Sandra looking after you, George? Oh yes, she's been very... I must say, I am concerned about who's paying for all of this. I don't think that's really very... No, he's quite right. These are questions that need to be asked. Mrs. Craske. - Mrs. Craske? - Yes. I hung her upside-down by her bloomers from the end of the pier and I told her, unless she paid for tonight's party, we'd never perform any Rogers and Hammerstein ever again. - Norman... - That seemed to do the trick. The only reason I ask is because, well, since you have all the figures up there, you'll know that income from the venue has remained static, for the past three years. Which means, of course, an actual revenue drop of 8.4%. The income from this theater has indeed remained static despite the last three seasons selling out. So have the wages, apart from mine, but then, of course, you know that I took a wage cut this year. Laura: Is this really the time? Which I'm record as objecting to. It's not good business. If you can't balance the books, you should put up the price of the tickets or make internal economies, or... Or? Nothing. Norman: Tell me, George, where do you live? I live over towards... Towards the rich people, well, I live here. And I can tell you without the aid of computer analysis that people in this town don't have a lot of money. Look at the unemployment figures, go down to pubs, hang out by the chippies, and you'll very quickly come to the conclusion that raising the ticket prices is a no-no. So, onto rescue plan number two. What was it you called it, "internal economies?" The reason, George, that this unique institution functions as well as it does is due to these people. Some of whom have been here since you were playing naughty games with the other boys in the shower rooms at Harrow. Damn it, Norman, I went to a mixed state school, actually! Well, whatever, the point is, I am not prepared to sacrifice any of my staff in order to make your department look lean and mean. I lived through the miner's strike, Mr. Comerford, and you're not employing any of those tactics on my pier. Bravo! The miner's strike? Have you gone mad? We haven't discussed option three!

Cedric? Sorry, have you seen Norman? He didn't come into work yesterday. - Yes, he's upstairs. - Oh, thanks. And we get about 20 in a year. What are you sulking about? I'm not sulking, I'm brooding. Sulking, brooding, what's the difference? George is only trying to do his job. It's not his fault that he's... That he's a self-satisfied graduate with a laptop? Just 'cause you didn't go to university. I went to the university of life. - It's nice, isn't it? - Nice? She's beautiful. The most advanced boat of its kind in the world. - Have you been out on it? - No. You have to stop when you're 55, they won't insure you. - That's age discrimination. - No, it's good sense. Can you imagine someone like Cedric let loose on her? Or me? Or you. Your father was a lifeboatman, wasn't he? He was a coxswain. Evening, Mom. Is Dad back? I saw the boat go out. Norman, love. Your dad, he's... A couple of silly, stupid kids in a dinghy, fancy going out in this weather. And now he's gone. He saved the kids. Should we go out for lunch? We're supposed to be working. We can call it a lunch meeting. I do love lunch meetings. They're so delightfully decadent. I hardly think that this... Lobster and a nice dry Chablis might have been a bit more enticing. And hardly justifiable in these times of financial constraint. No. Now, you've had two months on this theater business. Any progress? Blue Skies Productions from London think they may have time to take on the project. They're coming up tomorrow to formulate a strategy. I see. Gently, tiger. Have you told Norman yet? Ah, yes. No. I was hoping you... Do your dirty work for you? Well there's no point in me trying to talk to him. - But he likes you. - I'm sure he likes you. It's your... he has an aversion to. All right, I'll had a word. But you owe me a proper lunch next time. Coping without you, then? Just wait till they hit real trouble. Did you ever hit real trouble? Honestly? No. I'd have been more at risk on the children's boating lake. - Shall I take those? - Thank you. Sandra, I've known you all these years, but, tell me, what do you do, socially, I mean, when you're not at the theater? Friends. Some very amateur life drawing, and lots of singing. I'm in three choirs and I'm quite good, actually. And looking after Mother, of course. Boyfriends? A fiancée, a long time ago. He died. Oh, I'm sorry, that's awful. Other boyfriends over the years. But nothing ever really worked out. They were probably frightened off by Mother, or I was frightened off by them. - Is your mother a monster? - No, she's very frail. But she's a demanding old bag. I love her. I can't decide whether I need her more than she needs me. If things had gone differently, I'm sure I wouldn't have felt any qualms about bunging her in a home years ago, but, as it is, I stayed where I am because I never had the courage to take flight. I never had the courage, either. Where would you have flown to? Who with? Oh, no one. Nowhere. Maybe I'll tell you sometime. It's all right, really. Why do you think it doesn't happen for people like us? Taking flight. Maybe it just wasn't supposed to happen. It's not a wasted life, you know. Look around you. Lunch meeting? Well, we had a few things to discuss. So we thought we'd, you know, take a... Of course! Mind if I join you? Please do. Now, Norman. I want to put a proposition to you, and I want you to promise not to go on the defensive. I promise. I want to bring someone in to help you with the winter programming. - What? - Norman. George has found a company, Blue Skies Productions, that think they can increase the off-season revenue. So the council are putting the theater up for tender? Absolutely not, there'll be no decision on an outside producer for the time being. Pardon my naivety, but since we're supposed to be in a parlous financial state, how are you gonna pay for this? Oh, we'll judiciously tweak the folk dance grant. And George has sold promenade franchise to an organic ice cream business. So, that should just about do it. Mr. Whipit isn't gonna like the organic competition. He doesn't sell much at this time of year as it is. George assures me it's all agreed. It was all agreed with the healthy smoothie stall and look what happened to that. I've never seen flames shoot so high. Well, that'll be George's problem. Your problem is whether you're prepared to give this a try. Oh, I'll give it a try. But I reserve the right to be sulky and difficult. You are neither of those things. Now, the Blue Skies people are arriving tomorrow, so it might be as well to stay in for lunch. No doubt this bloke will have a nuclear-powered laptop and a doctorate in artspeak. Norman, don't whinge. I'm not, I'm just saying... You are whinging and I won't have it. You're still the boss of the theater, so kindly start being, bossy. - Cheers, Cedric. - Oh, cheers. - Cheers. - Bottoms up. So, when is the new chap arriving? Bloody hell. What time did I go to the toilet this morning? Hey, I only repeat information that's in the public interest. The public is not interested in who runs the theater. But we are, Norman. We don't want things changing. Except for that arty-farty stuff you do. What was that thing you put on last winter, Pig whatsit? I believe you are referring to Pygmalion, by George Bernard Shaw. That's the one. I had to leave at the interval. All those words. Mrs. Craske, you like My Fair Lady, don't you? Oh, yes. It's my favorite musical. Which is closely based on Pygmalion. Cedric: Oh, so what's that Marriage of Figaro based on, then? The Marriage of Figaro, by Beaumarchais. And is the play as long as the opera? Only, half the audience missed their last bus that night. Although strictly speaking they'd all have fitted in a taxi. Well I can't help it if the people of this town are frightened by a little dose of culture. Little dose? You mean like a social disease? Well, I should keep on trying. You carry on, son, and we'll support you. Only, don't expect us to come to your culture bashes. No, only joking. Look, you give us something we know, and we'll come along to something we don't know. Now, what could be fairer than that? Well I'm sure Mr. Blue Skies will give you plenty of stuff that you know. - It's Eddie Richards. - Well who's Eddie Richards? Mr. Blue Skies, I Googled him. And didn't there used to be a Richards at the theater - when you were a lad? - No, that was Richardson. Teddy Richardson. Teddy Richardson? Teddy Richardson. Eddie Richards. Look, it's complicated, I'll explain later. Well, that would be nice. So, Mr. Richards, you two know each other? In a manner of speaking. So, why didn't you talk to Norman after we'd spoken? - Well, it's been a while. - 40 years! 42. I thought it was more appropriate to go through the proper channels. - Do it official, like. - Oh, very appropriate. Well, you two must have lots of catching up to do. Let's leave them to it, George. George: We'll pick this up tomorrow, then, yeah? Eddie: So, how's it goin' then, Norman, old mate? Yeah, don't "old mate" me, what are you doing here? I'm here to help you spice up the winter season. Lend you a hand. Norman: And worm your way into getting the contract to run this place? No, that's not the idea at all. No, but the thought must have crossed your mind. Oh, when George first called, yeah. But when he said you were running the gaff, I thought no more about it. Besides which, I'm pretty busy. I can't imagine I'd have time to be more than a sort of consultant. You know, I can't really imagine you in the role of consultant, Teddy. Eddie. - Troubleshooter, then. - Trouble? Oh, yeah, you were always that. Eddie: Oh, come on. We were mates. That was a long time ago. A man with a past, eh? Richards, Richardson, it's all very intriguing. Well everybody has a past. I agree. Some more colorful than others. There was a very odd vibe between him and Norman. It will be fine, just trust my judgment, please. Laura: It's my judgment I'm concerned about. Nothing to do with me, Norman. A lot of dodgy characters around here at the moment. I reckon that was someone from London. We need to talk, Norman. Ice cream? - What, in this weather? - Test of character. Two large ones, please. Actually, you have to talk. Why didn't you stay in touch when you moved to London - all those years ago? - I know, I'm sorry. You were gonna get me to join you, it was all organized. I know, I know and I'm sorry, I really am! I was fast-tracked into theater management. Who's he? I'd never even met the Richardson gang. Just my luck, having the same name. But I knew who Jack the Hat McVitie was. - Who are ya? - Teddy. - Teddy who? - Teddy Richardson. Well you tell your uncles, or your cousins, or whoever the fuck they are, that Ronnie is disappointed! Do you know what that means? - I think so. - "I think so." You tell 'em, or I'll be back for you! What a dump. And why I had to change my name and lie low, which is why you never heard from me. I mean, you've heard about the Richardsons and the Krays? Yeah, I was living in Norfolk, Eddie, not Outer Mongolia. Not exactly gangland, but we do our best. Hey. There you go. I know, and we're dealing with it. We can't go any faster. Man: I'm sure you can. Look, I don't have to do this job, you know. Man: Well, I do have to do this job. I actually earn my living from it and I need to be in the know. When Mr. Richards has something to report, you'll be the first to know. Arsehole. Poor old Norman. - Where's Mr. Richards? - I threw him off the pier. Well, kindly go and rescue him. You owe it to yourself to give him a chance. Yeah, it's not that easy. Yes, it is! Oh, is this a reprimand? Um... Yes. Well, in that case, I shall overcome childish animosity and embrace Mr. Richards as the prodigal returned. Saint Norman. And smugly smile as he cons the lot of you and make a dog's dinner of the whole thing. That was great. Same time tomorrow, guys. Larry, this is Eddie Richards, who's gonna help me plan the winter season. Pleased to meet you, Eddie. What's the band still doing here? The season's finished. Oh, I let them rehearse here when we're dark. I hope you charge 'em. Of course you don't. They're good! - Where are they from? - All over. Musical misfits who find this place congenial. Blimey. - Are they union members? - Yes. Pity. That Eddie Richards. - What about him? - Interesting character. - In what way? - "Eddie Richards." "Trading as Blue Skies Productions. "Blue Sea Cruises, Blue Ribbon Entertainments, "Blue Sound Records. "Contact Central London branch before accepting engagements" "from any of the above companies." Musicians Union mag. Enjoy. - Man: Hello. - Musicians Union? Eddie: What other music do you get here? A lot of tribute bands. - They can do well. - Some do, some don't. We've had four different ABBAs with musical talent in inverse proportion to the height of their platform boots. We've had an Elvis who sounded like Liza Minnelli and a Liza Minnelli who looked like Alice Cooper. - And the audience? - They don't like it. They might have an average age of 80, but they're not idiots. Why can't you get a better act? Because... Because you don't pay guarantees. A good act won't go for a split of the box office. It's a vicious circle. What else have you tried? I've tried to raise the stakes from time to time, small-scale opera, the odd play, ballet. And? I see, the turns outnumber the audience? Not sure I can help too much with the cultural bit. You surprise me. I worked with him. Rhodes, summer season. He booked four boy dancers. - And he didn't pay you? - Oh, he paid us, in drachma. Which was a restricted currency. So we had to wrap the notes in carbon paper and send them home, then cash them for fourpence when we got back. But that isn't the worst of it. Well, sounds pretty bad to me. Drag. What? That creep Eddie Richards didn't tell us we'd be in drag. Sequins, bloody ostrich feathers, the lot. I have my pride, you know. Oh, I know. Four months. Four months of shaving my body, crushing my credentials and dancing behind Chantal, a Moroccan boy who'd had a sex change. He did a tassel dance and Eartha Kitt impressions. Thanks for this, Julian. You won't mention me, but one of the other boys in Rhodes is now a tax inspector, and I bet he'd love to have a go at Mr. Richards. - Hello. - Laura, it's Sandra. I'm sorry to bother you at home, have you got a moment? I'm a bit tied up right now, but go on. You know I've been trying to encourage Norman to cooperate with Eddie Richards? Well, now I'm having second thoughts. Such as? I've heard this rather worrying story about drag acts. Drag acts? Yes, you know, sequins and ostrich feathers. Ostrich feathers? Sandra, do you think your feelings for Norman are biasing your judgment about Mr. Richards? I don't have feelings for Norman. I'm sorry, my misunderstanding. But things are moving rather rapidly. The council are determined to tackle the theater deficit now so if Mr. Richards can come up with a plan, I can calm things down. If not... Anyway, tell me your concerns. It's nothing, you're probably right. I'm being overprotective of Norman. Sorry to disturb you. Bye bye. Bye! Carry on. Excuse me. You're the new theater chappy, then? Word gets about. - Where's Norman? - Gone home, I think. - Are you friends of his? - Friends and admirers. We're his loyal audience. Well in that case, would you like a drink? - Don't mind if I do. - Thought you'd never ask. Eddie Richards. Pleased to meet you, Miss? Mrs. Craske. And this is Cedric. You be nice to him, he gets dangerous when he's had a few. Eddie: Thanks, I'll bear that in mind. I do remember you. You were young Teddy. You used to flog those pheasants. Always used to wonder where you'd got 'em from. I don't remember that. It was all perfectly legal. It's Eddie now. Eddie, Teddy, Neddy, whoever you are. I ought to tell you that we're very loyal to Norman, and his theater. Well, it's not actually Norman's theater. You know what I mean. We're not keen on change, are we, ladies? Not at all. That's a relief, neither am I. I'm just here to look at the winter programming. Nothing's gonna happen overnight. Tell me. What would you like to see in the winter season? - No plays. - No opera. No ABBA. So, we know what you don't want. What do you want? - I don't know. - A bit of fun. - A bit of fun? - Yes, fun. I've got lots of ideas. I don't suppose you'd like to share those ideas with me? I might. Same again. On my tab. Man: Mrs. Craske, do you want the prize or the question? Oh, I'll take the question. Right! George Michael is straight, gay, bisexual, or... What in God's name is going on? Eddie: Morning, Norman! Do you know Andy Tarrant, from Eastern Television? - I said, what's going on? - A little experiment. Can't call it Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, 'cause they'll sue us. Besides, we haven't got that kind of dosh. So, we'll offer dinner-for-two somewhere. I'm thinkin' of callin' it Meal Or No Meal. - And what's she doing here? - I'm the guinea pig! A lamb to the slaughter, more like. Mr. Tarrant, I'm afraid you're here under false pretenses. I suggest you go back to reading the weather forecast and forget this ever happened! - Bloody Norman. - What's wrong with him? I set him up a brilliant idea that he immediately rubbished. Well, if at first you don't succeed... Oh, I will try again. The next one is a sure-fire winner. This "sure-fire winner." Does it involve musicians? - Yes. - But not paying them? What are you trying to get at? Boy dancers, will you be using any? Sort of boy dancers, yes. And only telling them they have to be in drag, - after they have signed up. - Drag? Do you know a lot of people in our business? Not really. Information is easy to come by. The drag thing was a mistake. It was a long time ago. - And the Musicians Union? - What about them? You said yourself, you don't many people in our business, so you probably wouldn't understand that a successful project takes a while to develop. It has to be nurtured, budgets have to be triple-checked, artists have to be chosen carefully. You've got a week. Right. And if you do anything to upset Norman, you'll regret it. Right. Right, well I'm off back to the hotel to do some work. If Norman wants to talk in a civilized manner, that's where I'll be, in the Alma Cogan Suite. I used to know her. Nice girl. Not my type. It's a nice place you've got here. Your husband must do well. A true voice of feminism. Actually, all my husbands did well. - Particularly the last one. - Oh, what did he do, then? - He was in oil. - Oh, what was he, a sardine? Anyway. Tell me, how are things progressing? - Steaming along. - Good. Time is of the essence. It always is in our business, George, mate, it always is. Of course, shows have to be planned. I'm sure they do, but George is right. Things need to happen fast. Any hint as to when you'll be presenting your initial proposal? Any day now. I'm working on this idea, it's a corker. Now, you must have seen that film... Excuse me. With pleasure. Do keep us posted. - Richards, where are you? - Siberia. Funny. You can run, you piece of shit, but you can't hide. Sort it. - Laura. - Laura: Sandra. I used to have a dress exactly like that. Where did you get it? - A charity shop. - Oh. Right. Well, you look fantastic. I try to make an effort. Is Norman coming tonight? He was invited. Did he not say anything to you? I've not seen a lot of him in the past few days. Perhaps it's best he's not here. I haven't told anyone else yet, but it's official now. Unless he can clear the deficit by Christmas, it'll be curtains, as they say. The theater will be closed and put out to tender. I'm really sorry. Oh, this is great, boys, this is great! Get ready, get ready, twirl and twirl and twirl! And go! Keep the line, keep the line! Let go! That's it! Oh, morning, Norman. Brilliant idea, eh? Despite the tourists guzzling most of the crab, these gentlemen are still employed fishermen, not unemployed steelworkers. Robbie Craske, does your mother know about this? Well, it's her idea, Norman. Ah, well I might have known it. Daniel. Does your father approve of you getting your kit off? He ought to, he's here himself. Won't be much crabbing happening from now on, will there, Paul? What's the missus gonna think about that? Well, she'll like the money from this, Norman. - Paying you well, is he? - We're on a percentage. Oh, well that's all right, then. You, Mark, your girlfriend happy about you displaying the ol' meat and veg in public? I ain't got nothin' to be ashamed of, Norman. I'm sure you haven't, but you know what it's like on the boat when it gets very cold, how everything seems to shrivel? Yeah. Well, it's just like that on stage. Very drafty places, stages. Especially those perched above the North Sea. Don't you listen to him, son, the lights are warm... Would you like to go to my office, Mr. Richards? We need to have a little chat. Traitor. Only trying to help. Well help these poor saps into their coats, then, and back into the boats. Thank you, gentlemen. The audition is now over. Generous supplies of crab and lobster throughout next season might just persuade me to keep my mouth shut about today. God. What the bloody hell was that farrago all about? I was just humoring Mrs. Craske. Keeping the regulars happy, all that. You rotten sod. You won't even take responsibility for the ideas that you steal. I would have done if you'd liked it. That was a joke. Look, I'm here to do a job. It's not easy if you won't get involved! We live in different worlds. I suspect we always did. What do we do, then? You carry on making an arse of yourself. I'm off for a few days. Bloody hell, Norman. Of course. Double Take Agency! - Barry? - Richards. You got my money? - Not exactly. - You toerag. I told you... But, I have had an idea that will make us both a lot of money. Piss off. Barry, trust me. Oh, well, at least you started my day with a laugh. You've got one minute. What do you want? Alma Cogan. A bit late, she's been dead 40 years. Yeah, ha ha. I want an Alma Cogan tribute artist. Try Madame Tussauds. Seriously, Barry, I'm doing a bit of consultancy work at this funny little place up on the East Coast. Now I tell you, the audience here is old enough to remember her mother. Consultancy work? You tosser. Still, it's not a bad idea. Alma was bloody good. It's a tragedy she popped off so young. Exactly. So, I need you to organize a cattle call. Find me Alma Cogan, you know, aged about 30, the real deal. Think about it, Barry, all those geriatric audiences that think that civilization died when rock and roll was born. I have thought about it. You get me my money and quick. You're quick, or you're dead. Do you get it? Double Take Agency! Just putting you through. Sandra, what are you doing here? What are you doing here, are you ill? Won't you sit down? Look, I'm sorry for banging on your door, but you weren't at the party last night and, and then you disappeared this morning, are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine! I just don't think me and Eddie being in the same place is a very good idea. He's trying to save the theater. Norman: He's trying to run the theater. If someone doesn't do something, there won't be a theater to run. What do you mean? If you'd been at the party, Laura would have told you herself. The deficit has to be cleared by Christmas or the council will close us down. Ah, they wouldn't do that. Get your bloody head out of the sand, Norman. I'm sorry, I'm just concerned. And I appreciate your concern. It's just that I know how this is gonna play. George thinks that Eddie is some kind of Cecil B. DeMille, so I'm gonna take some of the holiday I'm owed, and leave him to it. You're not listening. Laura was serious last night. It's political scaremongering. Why don't you take a few days off as well? Why? No particular reason. I could teach you to shoot duck.

Although, I would have preferred... - Have you enjoyed your, um... - Non-break? It's been fine, thank you. Any chance of you popping back to the theater sometime? Next week, definitely. Good. And you'll try to be reasonable with Eddie Richards? - He's working very hard. - Absolutely. Look, I'll see you Monday. Would you like to stay for the concert? Richards! I've got something for you. Barry. No, I don't have your money. I don't have my Alma. Just do whatever you have to do. It couldn't make things any worse. Where is he, then? Oh, I'm sure he'll be here soon. I can't wait to see what he's got lined up for us. Well, I'm giving him five minutes. Oh relax, George, you can't rush these things. Indeed, you can't. Sorry to keep you waiting, folks. We're on the edge of our seats. What's it to be today, Eddie, wife-swapping? Nude fishermen wrestling in the mud? I admit the male strippers may have been - a bit of a mistake. - Oh, surely not. But, I have really got a treat for you today. The audience is fed up with the same old tribute acts. And let's not beat about the bush. Your core punters are somewhat on the elderly side. So, I got my old mate, Barry Bates there, find me the most successful British female pop star of the 50s and early 60s. And given that I've been sleeping in her bed, as it were, I'm surprised I didn't think of her before. Anyway. I guarantee that 99% of your winter audience will be bathed in a warm glow of reminiscence when they see this young lady.

Come on down, Alma. You might call her by her real name. Believe it or not, that is her real name. Alma Collins. My mom was nuts about Alma Cogan. My dad loved Alma Cogan, too. So, I remember her. You're uncannily like her. And she knows all the old songs, too. I never thought I'd get to use them professionally though. Oh, you will. All over the country, starting here. And we've lined up Cathy Kirby, Lita Roza, Ann Shelton. We'll have a season, then a national tour of pre rock and roll stars, and the theater gets a percentage. Ridiculous! Does anybody else think that? Get down off your artsy pedestal, mate. You're no different from the rest of us. You shit in the morning, don't you? Mind you, since you're so full of shit, maybe you don't. Why can't you leave the past alone? Bloody hell. No pleasing some people. Anyway, let's get busy, I wanna cover the town with posters, I want local radio, newspapers. I want to open in a week. Norman. What's the matter? I know that you and Eddie don't exactly see eye-to-eye, but that girl seemed very good. Mind you, I don't really remember Alma Cogan. Well, I do. She ruined my life. What do you mean? Alma Cogan played here one night at this theater in 1964. She was amazing. Glamorous, sexy, funny. And with that wonderful voice. "The girl with the laugh in her voice." That's what she was known as. And she seemed to be laughing 'cause she was having such a good time on that stage, and she wanted to share it with every one of us. ♪ When all is said and done ♪ We've got twice the blessings and we've got twice the fun ♪ ♪ 20 tiny fingers ♪ 20 tiny toes ♪ Two angel faces ♪ Each with a turned up nose ♪ One looks like Mommy ♪ With a cute little curl on top ♪ ♪ And the other one's got a big bald spot ♪ After the show, we went round to her dressing room to ask for her autograph. Come in, mind the frocks. Miss Cogan, I'm sorry to disturb, I just want to tell you I thought you were wonderful tonight. Thank you. What a sweet thing to say. Would you, would you mind signing this for me? I could do better than that. What's your name? Norman. There you are. Now perhaps you could do me a favor. - Are you leaving now? - Oh yes, yes, sorry. No, silly. I didn't mean go away, it's just that my lot have all gone off to catch last orders at the pub. Would you mind walking me back to my hotel? Oh, yes, I'd be delighted. Give me two minutes, then. I thought there would be fans waiting at the stage door, but it was deserted. We walked along the pier and chatted. It was all very natural. Me, with the biggest female star of the day. I've never done an end of the pier show before. My agent said the Pavilion Theater. He didn't mention I'd be halfway to Siberia. You must feel a bit let down. I don't allow things like that to worry me. - The audience was happy. - They were thrilled! I don't remember anyone getting such a good reception. How long have you worked at the theater? Five years, since I left school. - I lived here my whole life. - With your parents? Unfortunately, yes. There's nothing wrong with living with your family. I live with my mom's sister, it's fun. Maybe, but at least you know you don't have to. I haven't got an option. You've got a point. Norman: When we got to the hotel, she invited me in for a drink. Do you enjoy touring? Coming to funny little places like this? I'd sooner be playing the Talk of the Town, if I'm honest. But you can't do that 52 weeks a year. A girl has to work. But you must have earned loads from all your records. Oh, sorry, that was a bit rude, wasn't it? No, it's all right. The thing is, Norman. I haven't had a hit record for, well, a while. And the money soon goes. Anyway, I love performing and I'll do it as long as they want me. And then? I don't know. Settle down? Get married. Have children. I don't know. Let's have another drink. Norman: I was very naive. But I got the sense that she was rather lonely and sad. She weren't bubbly anymore. Perhaps performing in a place that she probably wouldn't have played a few years previously was the fact that her career might be finite. Anyway, as I said, I was naive, and when she asked me up to her room, the Alma Cogan Suite, as it is now... Did you? I've never told a living soul what happened that night. I'm very honored. You mustn't think that she was some sort of nymphomaniac devouring lusty young bits of rough. For a start, I wasn't exactly Marlon Brando. It's just that she was lonely and I was sympathetic. So? Get onto the interesting bit. Sorry, sorry. It's just you as a toyboy. You have to admit, it's a bit unexpected. What happened next was pretty unexpected, I can tell you. Go on. - I can't! - You can't stop now! - I couldn't stop then! - You don't mean... Yes! - It's all right. - No, it's not all right! I'm really, really sorry about that. That's never happened to me before. - Well, actually... - It's all right. I'm sure it hasn't. And I'm flattered. Come and sit down. Norman, I think you're a really nice young man. I'm going to suggest that you go now, not because I don't like you, but because I'm really quite tired and I have to leave early tomorrow. Take this. If you're ever in London, I want you to promise that you'll call. - Promise. - I promise. We can go out somewhere nice and get to know each other a little better. I'd like that very much. Good. And I'll write to you at the theater. Norman: And she did. A few weeks later, I got a postcard. She was on tour in Germany. - So did you go and see her? - I was too scared. You see, there was always stories in the papers about the parties that Alma threw. She knew everyone, The Beatles, Lionel Bart, Noel Coward. I knew I'd be hopelessly out of my depth. A sort of country bumpkin mascot. So, I decided that I would do something about that. I did what I'd never had a chance to do at school. I read the classics, I went to plays, concerts, art galleries, anything I could. It wasn't easy, living up here, but I soon to came to see that my life had become immeasurably richer. I was like Eliza Doolittle. I started out wanting the flower shop, and now I was ready for the ball. But you still didn't go to London? I was all set to go and then my dad got killed in the lifeboat and that was that. I couldn't leave Mom, she was in deep shock. So was I, I suppose. And then, one morning, about a year later, I came to realize that all this self-improvement was a complete waste of time. - Well, I never. - What? - It's young Teddy Richardson. - Where? In the paper! "Alma Cogan records Beatles hits. "Alma, pictured at Abbey Road Studios with John and Paul" "and Paul's girlfriend Jane Asher." And there's Teddy. He's a bit young for Alma Cogan, isn't he? - Oh, the rotten bastard! - Norman! He's your friend. He was my friend. But the thought of him with Alma... You were in love with her. In love with Alma Cogan? Was I? I don't know. She was kind to me. And I know I was obsessed with her, but in love? I think I was in love with what she represented. A girl from a very ordinary background who took flight. Not in the sense of running away, but doing what she felt passionate about. And then Teddy sneaked in there. And 40 years later, returns to the theater and brings her back to life. To rub salt in the wound, ends up staying in the bloody Alma Cogan Suite. Wait a minute, Norman. When Eddie told me that that was where he was staying, he said he'd known Alma Cogan, and that she wasn't his type at all. She never had an affair with Eddie Richards. What do I do now? Your job?

Well, it's difficult to remember after all these years. No, it isn't. Oh, yeah. No! I was nuts about Jane Asher! I chased her all over town. For some reason, she preferred that Paul McCartney bloke. Well, in that case, I've decided to take early retirement. I'm burying the hatchet, Eddie. If you want the job, I'll support you. What in God's name has this got to do with Alma Cogan? Nothing, really, and everything. The point is, it's time to go. George: Eddie? Well, I'll have to consult with my... When do I start? Well, now, I suppose. But Norman, is this what you really want? I've never been more sure of anything. I'm handing my notice in as well. I'll wait till after the funeral, but then I'll be off. George: What will you do? I'm thinking of traveling. Going on a cruise. Then, we'll see. Now, I'd like to go and see how they're getting on at the boathouse. And I've got a tour to book. All right, probably won't see me for a while. Okay. You kept pretty quiet about your travel plans. I've been thinking about it for a while. Probably took Mother passing on to prod me into action. But you'll come back? I don't know. You could come with me. Oh, I don't know. You're taking flight. I'd just be running away. You really don't remember me? I don't. What? Loretta? The Revuebar? The routine with the ostrich feathers. Oh, my God. You married that agent, the one who, uh... Preferred boys. I did better subsequently. Obviously. I'm in shock. When did you recognize me? As soon as I saw you. All the girls used to fancy you, you know? Oh, well... Back then. Have I changed that much? I have. Does anybody up here know that you were a... Dancer? No. I shall have to rely on your discretion. Mum's the word. Loretta, I think you and I are gonna get along famously. Norman: George! You've been disconnected. How are you functioning? It's all up here, Norman. Bye. See? Even George has it worked out. - It's all up here. - Yeah. You can do anything you want to now. That's just the problem. Thank you. I'd like to finish by thanking my wonderful band who bravely elected to forego the joys of the East Coast of England in winter for cruising on the Caribbean.
