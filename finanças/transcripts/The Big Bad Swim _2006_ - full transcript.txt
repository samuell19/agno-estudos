Hi, I'm Noah Owens. I'm a personal trainer here at the rec center. I'm also the adult swim instructor. Welcome all of you to my class. I know how hard it was for you all to come here. Everything you're feeling is valid. My job here is to get you comfortable in the water, but I won't push it. You have to go at your own pace. So, if you feel like you've had enough, just come and tell me and we'll stop. How I wanna start off, and I want you to be honest... who here is afraid of the water? Or, who would say that they're anxious being submerged underwater? OK. We're going to start with the basics today. We're gonna blow bubbles underwater. So, for those of you who are comfortable, let's make our way down to the pool and we'll get in. I have never wanted anyone to see me in my bathing suit, so I have always avoided swimming situations. I sort of put off the whole idea of swimming for both of us for quite some time. I did have a negative experience with water at one time. It was a long time ago, when I was much younger. I am so afraid of the water, I can't even begin to tell you. I am petrified. Anyway, I just built a big pool and it's time to learn how to swim. My name is Carl Oakley, and, um, I'm a patrolman over at the Old Saybrook Police Department. I'm sorry. I think I better go, because there is no way I'm getting in that water. I'm Jordan. I didn't have any negative experiences really. I just didn't have access to any beaches or pools where I grew up, so here I am. I fucking hate to swim. Wow! I'm beginning to see that I'm probably a much better swimmer than most of you, all of you, whatever. That's fine, because I purposely wanted to take a slower class. This is my birthday present. Hi! My name is Amy Pierson. And I also don't know how to swim. Um, when I was six, my cousin Lori drowned and that was pretty much all it took for me to never-- Um... anyway, lately, I've been thinking, at this point in my life, I would like to conquer something I've always been afraid of. You guys have until the end of the period. When you finish and you hand your tests in to me, you may sit quietly in your seats or you may leave, which is preferable to me. Mrs. Pierson? I was wondering if you wanted us to show our work. Oh, David, that is a great question. Hunter, could you please read the first line written at the top of your test? "Name: Hunter McCarthy." Julia. "Students must show all work." OK, uh, I hadn't read that yet. You have 45 minutes. Please show all of your work. And remember, you guys, most importantly, have fun. Uggh. I want to go off my meds. I don't think it's the worst idea. - So I just go cold turkey? - Mm-hmm. If you want. I'm gonna quit my job too, after this next course, six weeks. A lot of big decisions lately. Damn right. Damn right. What do you mean? Leaving your job, going off disability, and last week you were talking about... ...getting a new dog. Eyes on your own papers, please. Whoop! That's five points off your test. - Oh, come on-- - You wanna make it ten? During class? They're testing. What is it? OK. Um... What is it? What is it? Tom would like to see us both. - Can you do it after eighth? - No, I can't. Why does he want to see us, Paul? I'm fairly sure that he's going to tell us that one of us has to leave. People are starting to get uncomfortable. OK, then that's you. So you go talk to him. I don't know which one of us should leave. I don't want to leave, so I think this is something that you and I need to discuss tonight. You coming home tonight? I will be home after my swim class. Then I'll tell Tom that we'll have an answer for him in the morning, OK? That's fine. And now the jackpot question. Which NFL team has lost the most Super Bowl games? - Walter. - The Buffa-- OK, last week we started with blowing bubbles, which we all survived. This week we're going to incorporate the buddy system, which means you are now responsible for yourself and your buddy. So let's split off into pairs. Rosy and Efram, you guys look great together. You're a pair. Good, yeah, spread out over here a little bit. Great. Amy and Jordan, you guys want to work together? Marybeth and Paula, you two are a pair. Uhhh... Carl? You wanna get in the pool today, buddy? No. Maybe later, man. - You don't want to get in the shallow end? - No, Noah, maybe later! OK, OK. You don't have to kick hard. Don't worry about making a big splash or moving at the speed of light. We want firm, steady kicks that flow. One, two. One, two. One, two. That's good, Paula. Good. OK, everyone. Relax. Take a break. Yeah! Ow, my arms. Seems like you got it. Yeah, I can kick off a kickboard, I'm amazing. Yeah, well, we gotta go through some basics. And then what? It will get really, really hard? God, he is great looking, isn't he? He's fine. Eh... Yeah, fine. Efram? You all right? I fucking hate swim! Good, everyone. Very good. We are made in such a way that we naturally float. Now I want you all to take a deep breath and hold it. Feel the difference? You become more buoyant with air in your lungs. You can control yourself in the water, and that's what we're here to learn. OK, good class tonight, everybody. You guys did a great job. See you Thursday night. Bye, Jordan. Bye, Amy. Bye. What is her name? No idea. - I'll see you next time. - OK, good night. Umm, this is gonna sound pathetic. I'm sorry. What? Ahh, I said this is going to sound kind of pathetic. Umm... What is? Well, I just decided that I wanna try and make some new friends, and I was wondering if maybe sometime you'd like to go and get a drink or see a movie or something. Really? Feel free to say no. I mean, you know, we can just stay buddies, keep it professional. No. Yeah, I'd like that. Great. OK. - I'll see you here next week. - OK. Would you, uh, would you like to, um, do something now? - That sounds horrible. - Doesn't it? And everybody knows. I don't even know how. Thank you. Like they published it in the school newspaper or something. The students, the teachers, the whole staff. Do they know he's seeing the other teacher? To be honest, I'm not entirely sure he is. My husband is a very convincing liar. So, Jordan, what is it that you do? You must have a very exciting, young life to brag about. Hmm, no. Uh, I work at Mohegan Sun, the casino. Oh, uh-huh. Uh, blackjack, roulette, three card poker. See, that sounds like fun. Yeah, It's OK. Umm... I'm also a dancer, at a club called Juicees in Groton. I mean that I strip. I wasn't lying before. I deal also, but... Oh, no, no. I understand. Just wanted to get that out there. Wait. I'm sorry. So, do you get naked? Yeah, I'm a stripper. I strip off the clothes that I'm wearing. Right, right. Excuse me. I'm sorry to bother you, but those gentlemen over there would like to buy you two some drinks. Oh, please tell them no thank you. OK. Did... Did you wanna? No, no, no. Definitely not. No. It's just, it's been a little while since someone offered. Now, Amy, I think it's only fair that you and I get a chance to talk privately before we make any decisions, because Paul and I have already spoken. I didn't know that. Yeah, Paul and I briefly discussed the, you know, obvious uncomfortable tension that now exists between the two of you and by extension, your students and the remainder of the staff. Well, I understand that, but-- I've received numerous complaints from parents, whose children have overheard the two of you arguing. The two of you have started taking personal meetings with one another during classes. I'm sorry, Tom, I have to stop you there. OK, if you have to. Never, ever have I fought with my husband in front of another teacher or a student. And, as for this mysterious staff member who has come forward expressing their concerns, - I have a pretty good idea who it is... - Amy, look-- ...and what her concerns are, and it has absolutely nothing to do with my job or my performance as a teacher. Look, uh, we could sit here and argue all day, right? But what we should be doing is looking to forge solutions. Um, what we have here is a complicated situation, and sometimes when students are involved, you have to take things like fairness and, and, and equal rights and things of that nature and just throw them out the window and... and replace them with... responsibility. - Dealer has 17. Nice job. - Thank you. So, where are you from, Princess? I live in the area. Your tag says you are from Jordan. I am from Israel. So, uh... My name is Jordan. Oh, I see. Well, can... dealers named Jordan have drinks with customers like me? Sadly, no. It's forbidden. It's a bummer. Hello there. You look really hot. Well, my gosh, thank you. - You have time for a dance? - For you, Kenny, I got all the time in the world. Give me one second. ♪ I count the cases piled up high ♪ I can't believe he did that. Jerry, flex those thighs. Live in the studio-- In New London-- I lost so much weight. On the Slimphedra plan. ♪ For platform and for passerby ♪ ♪ It's the same routine ♪ ♪ I'm ranting while I'm raving ♪ ♪ There's nothing here worth saving ♪ ♪ Tell me now what more do you need ♪ ♪ Take me to Walter Reed tonight ♪ ♪ Baby, I lost the will for fighting ♪ ♪ Over everything... ♪ Good, you guys. - Amy? - Uh-huh? - Keep her a little higher? - Oh. I'm sorry. No. Let her breathe. Jordan, keep your hand in more of a tightly-cupped paddle. You don't want too much water slipping through. Good. That's good. Do you feel more resistance? - Yeah. - Yeah? Excellent. Here you go. Carl. What's going on, buddy? No, man, I'm done for the night, all right. My boy's coming to spend the summer with me, man. He wants to go to one of those water theme parks. If you want to stay in, we'll work something out. I've seen worse cases. Well, how did they work out, Noah? They quit. - Do you want to quit? - No. Hell, no. No. I need to learn how to swim, Noah. Well, then we'll work something out. All right, man. All right. What do you do for a living again, before I forget to ask? I'm a teacher. No, you're not. I am. A teacher. That's noble. So, how often do you come here? Every day. How do you survive, financially, I mean? I count cards. - You do not. - I sure do. You wouldn't say it out loud like that if you did. I do. Look, there's, uh, uh, six decks in a shoe. That's 312 cards, 24 tens, 72 face cards, 24 aces. So far, this guy right here has dealt 244-245 cards, which leaves, um... Sixty-seven. Wow. Welcome to the game. Well, I know how to subtract. I teach calculus. Calculus? Well, that's something I haven't used enough of since high school. Oh, yeah. And how long ago was that? Six years ago. How about you? So, you know how many aces are left in the shoe? Get the camera off me, Hunter. - Good evening, Jordan. - Where is my brother? He's downstairs right now, getting the mic. Let me ask you, though, have you seen any interesting wildlife in your room lately? I don't want you to buy me things like that, Hunter. It's really nice of you, but I... I want you to turn the camera off! OK. Don't buy me things. It's a waste of your money. Oh... I just, I thought you'd like it, so... Well, I'm not interested in dating anyone right now. Why not? And I'm not gonna date my brother's friends, so you can leave my bathroom. Why aren't you interested in dating anyone? Because I like being single. What about just casually sleeping together? - David! - Are you interested in that? David! - I'm serious. - Jordan! David, no. I said I'm not in the mood right now and your friend has gotten on my last nerve. Turn the camera off, Hunter. Come on. It'll take five minutes. Come on. Can we do this really quickly? - Can we do it tomorrow? - You promised you would do this. You said... it's for school. Why can't we do it tomorrow? Because I have to show it tomorrow. I have to show part of it, the beginning. All right, question number one. Are you ready? - Yes, I'm ready. - Is the...? Yes, he's ready! Question number one. "What does he/she do for a living?" Wow. Come on, they really give you this room for nothing? Yep. Well, if you include all the money I lose, no. But I don't pay rent, if that's what you mean. Right. But, you know, I got my utilities and that stuff adds up. You know, I think you're being purposely mysterious about your source of wealth. Really? I don't mean to be. I just don't see what's so exciting about being an astronaut. But, you know, everyone always wants to know what it's like. Right. You're probably a dot-commer or something, some kind of glorified computer guy. You know, you seem... kinda, I don't know, nervous. Do I? Thank you. Oh. How romantic. Oh, yeah. Oh, it's in the shoulders, I think. It's very tense. Oh yeah? What are you looking at down there? Umm... the view, I guess. It's pretty. It's a parking lot. Well, yeah, but... you've got a river and... some trees. Really? That's boring. See this thing that's over here behind me? It's really cool. Oh no, wait, don't, don't do that. Do what? You came here to get fucked tonight, didn't you? Didn't you come here to get fucked tonight? Yes. Hi, you've reached Paul and Amy. We're either not here or we're screening your call, so leave a message and we'll call you back. Paul? Are you there? Where are you? It's three in the morning. Where are you? Hey. Hey there. How you doing? Come here. Hi. Hi there. Hello? - Yes? - Hi. I was wondering if I could take a look at that shepherd out front. - How old is he? - He's spoken for. Would you like to come inside? We have more inside. The Keeshond and the Bassett are spoken for and so is the Golden. Down here we have a Yorkie-Shih Tzu mix that's been with us over a month. Um, no one's claimed him yet. Would you like to look at him? - Is he full grown? - Yes, he is. How often do you clean these cages? I clean them about twice a day. No one wants this one? No one yet. Um, we also have cats. Playing all the hits, all the time! - KCD 107.7, who is this? - Hi, this is Jennifer. Here you go. You have no messages. So, what's the problem? We were wondering if we could maybe change the assignment just a little bit? We wanted to do a documentary on the entire swim class... Oh, that your wife is enrolled in, even. So... OK, so... so instead of writing a biography, which was the original assignment, you guys want to do a documentary? Although not about a family member, now about a group of strangers learning to swim. Right. Because it will be funny. And, you know, my sister's all about it. She's all about it. I'm already allowing you to submit a video for your family biography assignment. But, but it'll be a biography in so many ways. OK, uh, the answer is no. The assignment is a family biography. It has to be a biography about your sister. Due in two weeks. On my desk. Or you both fail. OK, perfect, yeah. Hunter, what is your relationship to this person? Remind me again why you're working on this. Because I'm in love with her. OK, let's go. Everyone out of the pool. Michael, let's go. So, it doesn't seem like Efram's coming back. And Norah. Jamie, where's your mom? She decided she'd rather quit the class, Noah, but I'd like to stay on if that's all right with you. No, no, that's great, Jamie. I'm glad to hear it. Oh, who doesn't have a buddy? Rose? You want to buddy up with Jamie? OK. So, I'm gonna teach you some new strokes tonight. They're all pretty easy. We're gonna continue with the buddy assist method, before you're ready to free-swim on your own. Is that your dog? Yeah. All right, so I want to start with something that's-- What's its name? I don't have a name. But I'm open to ideas. How about Biscuit? Our dog's name is Biscuit. Well, that doesn't sound very original, but... I'll give it some thought, OK? How about Buddy? Like the buddy system? - Yeah. I guess that's OK. - Hell no. That's a shitty name for that dog, Noah. - I like it. - What's wrong with Biscuit? Your dog's name is Biscuit. I know. That's where I got the idea. Call him Bobby, call him Butt Nose. Who gives a crap? Thank you, Martin. I can't have a cute little doggy like you because my husband's allergic. Mwah! Imagine if you was allergic to dogs. Why, you would just be sneezing all the livelong day. Yes, you would, little one. Mwah! Oh, such a good girl. You want to go swimming, little one? You want to go in that pool? Yeah, you're a good doggy. Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14... 15, 16... Twenty-seven years. That's a long time. Yeah, you're telling me. That pot smells good. It gives me sea legs. You want a hit? - No, I better not. - You sure? - Yeah. - OK. Do you like being married? You want the truth or you want some bullshit? Truth. The truth, huh? Well, all things considered... love, sex... security, insecurities, and a lot of compromising... Yeah. I guess it beats being alone by about... oh... that much. OK, pay attention, everybody. Go on. Holy cow! From the Noah school of foot modeling. Let's hear it... Yee-ha! ...for the amazing Jamie! Yay! Outstanding, outstanding. Congratulations! Now you lift me. Come on. Hey, Jordan. - Hey. - You got a ride? Yeah, I got my car. Did you have an OK time in class? Yeah, I'm learning... slowly. Great. Well, you're doing a really good job. OK. Good night. I like your dog. Yeah? "Buddy." What do you think? Ehh... I don't know. You got one? It's also stupid. Well, this isn't the smartest dog. I don't know. He looks pretty smart to me. I was thinking that "Danger" might be a cute name. Danger! Danger. All right. To hell with "Buddy." Have a good night. - OK. Yeah, you too. - I'll see you Tuesday. You don't have to take that name. I'll see you Tuesday. Because women don't want to be degraded. They want respect. - I took her to dinner. - You took her to Sizzle. How is that degrading? I paid. I even ordered for her. I wonder who that could be. I'll get it. Trust me, Cody, you are never seeing that girl again. - No, trust me. - Hello! You look tired. Everything OK? Lately I've been sleeping in. And if I didn't have to work or take that dog for walks, I, uhh... I don't even know if I'd get out of bed. I'll be outside with this dog, 15, 20 minutes at a time. Nothing, won't go. Then, as soon as we go back inside, he squats somewhere and he shits and pisses on my floor. Yesterday, oh my God, yesterday he sees a deer in the woods behind my house and takes off deep into the woods. And five minutes pass. Ten minutes pass. Half-hour goes by. I can't see the dog. Screaming his name over and over. I thought that was it, I'd lost the dog forever, that it was just lost in the woods and was going to starve to death. Then, eventually, for whatever reason, he just came back to me. But... I just keep thinking, how can this be me on my own? I'm not like this. I swear I was never like this before. OK, everybody. Looking good. It's in two motions. It's feet then arms. Feet then arms. Two separate motions, OK? Noah, would you tell her she's doing it wrong? - She won't use her breasts. - Oh, really mature. You're doing very good. - Well, thank you, Noah. - You're welcome. All right, everyone, take a break. Relax. Hey, are you all right? - I'm fine. - No, he's not. He's gassed and it's not even break. I'm in better shape than this kid. Who would you like to see naked every night, me or him? Well, give me a minute to think about that. Hey! I don't know if I'm ready to move on and swim alone. I just need more time. Yeah, no, no, uh... I think you're right. We'll talk about it more after the break. I'm gonna make a quick phone call. No big deal. It's just that I really think I need more time. No, no, I think you're right. Absolutely. OK? I'm gonna get myself something to drink. - Can I get you something? - No, no, I'm fine. Thank you, though. It's combining it, 'cause... I can kick and I can do the scissor kick and I can do the reach and pull. But when I put them all together without you supporting me, I... Wait. You had the breaststroke down. Well, that's easy, you got that too. - Hey, guys. - Hey, Paula. You know, you guys are like the cool kids in the class. I think we are. How's Marybeth? Oh, God! She's so totally fucking boring. Because she's at this point in her life where all she can do is like yap about her kid like all day. Don't say anything, but this just happened and it's totally cool. I just asked Noah for his number and he gave it to me. Great. I was hoping there would be some single guys in the class, but, no, apparently I'm supposed to be dating the teacher. The fucking hot teacher. I mean, right? You just asked for his number and he gave it to you? Yeah. Oh, if he has a hesitation dating one of his students, I'll play Lolita. Well, let us know how that works out for you. I will. I'll see you later, guys. Wow. This is my time, too. If you're not ready, that's fine, but tonight... Maybe we can just go over the basics tonight? That's not your problem. You've watched me go over the basics with the entire class. You're my teacher, man, and I'm telling you the basics is what I need tonight! Keep stalling if you want. Keep giving me excuses. It's gonna go down one way or another. You're either gonna get in this water and face your fear or you're going to walk out the door like Norah and Efram. Guys, you're gonna do chapter 18, questions 1 through 9, and chapter 19, 1 through 11. A bonus question at the end of chapter 18, if anybody wants to... You better do it. See you tomorrow. Seniors. What are you gonna do? Yeah. So, how long is this going to take? Uh... Well, it's fifth period now, so maybe like an hour. - Hour and a half. - You can have ten minutes. Ten minutes, OK. - Yeah. - Perfect. Don't wanna hit you. You gotta kinda make it so it goes above her head, like that. Right there. I don't think that's right. Now, I'm curious. Was it humiliating for you to admit that you didn't know how to swim at such an old age? - Turn the camera off. - Why? OK. I get one question? Uh-huh. I would make it a really good one. OK. Um... What is your... What is your impression of my sister Jordan? Umm, well, uh... Jordan, Jordan, to me, is... and honestly I don't know her very well... but, umm... OK, let me just say this. If I were ever abandoned on a deserted island, I would want to bring Jordan with me. Because I would probably spend half the day trying to crack open a coconut or something and meanwhile Jordan would have built an entire bamboo hut complete with running water. Umm, what I mean is... I think that Jordan is an extremely strong and independent woman, and I hope that we will remain friends. So, this guy... - Yeah? - ...came in two nights ago, Bought like three dances from me. Not too gross. Not too touchy. I made a lot off him. That's cool. Anyway, he calls Allen yesterday, said he wants me and another girl for a bachelor party he's putting together for some killer guy. I'm not into going off-site. I'm not gonna beg, because every girl in here would jump at the opportunity. The girls that work here, in my opinion, are skanks, and I think you're cool. That's awesome. I'm gonna make six months' rent in one night and I'm not talking about doing anything but dancing. I wouldn't ask you to do that. Unless you're doing that, which is your business. I'm coming to you because if I'm going to go for it and "lez out" in front of a bunch of suits, then it should be with you. - Elyse, I'm not into-- - All I'm saying is this place is full of loose skanks and you're cool. If you don't need the money, well then, come on, why are you working here, right? Yeah. Let me know soon. OK. Later. Hi, my name is Desiree. Mmm, I know I'm hot, but wait till you see me... - Good girl. - ...with my three friends. Get out of here, Danger. We're looking to party, but we need one more. Think you can handle it? - Go on, get out of here. - Then come on and call me. Get out of here. It feels so good. Hi. You know, you were a little... perverted. Perverted? OK, first of all, I don't think anybody should be held responsible for anything that they say before or during sex. Second, I asked you if you came to get laid, and you said yes. Oh, now suddenly it's all coming back to me. Uh, oh, next time, less dirty talk. - Oh, next time? - Yeah. Amy? Diane! How are you? Where have you been? I've been calling incessantly. I know. I'm sorry. I just haven't been returning any of my messages lately. I really don't have any good excuse at the moment. Uh, where's Paul? Paul is in L.A. Really? Why? He went out there about a month ago. I haven't really talked to him since he left. Um, from what I understand, he met someone over the Internet who lives over there in California. He's an actor or an artist, apparently, I don't remember which. Um... So, yeah, I don't really know what to think. God! I can't believe I haven't called you back. That's so rude of me. No, God, no. Please forget it. You know, um... if we don't go now, now, right now, we're going to miss the... The buffet. - She's right. - Sorry. OK, well, call me at least, Amy, OK? God, this is so crazy. I'm so sorry. Oh, hey, don't be. Love fades. And you two look like a beautiful couple. It's a pleasure to meet you both. You have a good night, OK. - Hey. - Hi. What can I get you? May I have a gin and tonic, please? And I'm going to need some singles. Mm-hmm. Hi there. I... I'm really sorry. - I didn't know you worked here. - It's OK. You come in here often? No. I mean, but I... I drive by it a lot. So, uh, you got time for a dance, or are you busy with this guy now? I'll be with you in just a few, OK? Bye, sweetie. So I hear there's a little love blossoming in our swim class. Love? Yeah, Paula and Noah sittin' in a tree, - K-I-S-- - Hmm. Hmm. I mean that's what they're saying. That's not very professional of you. Oh, yeah, OK, no. She asked me for a private swim lesson. I'm just fucking around with you. You look really great tonight, Noah. That's a cool shirt. Thank you. Would you like a private dance? Are you acting right now? Do you want to dance with me? ♪ You can fly ♪ ♪ For the eagle's land ♪ ♪ Half an hour ♪ ♪ Before the dawning of the sun ♪ ♪ If and only ♪ ♪ You come back for me ♪ I think, uh, Jordan, in particular, had the added benefit of not exactly being afraid of the water originally. Umm... And actually she's very eager to get in and learn. She's a quick learner, too. She, uh... She easily breaks bad habits and I think she could've been a really great swimmer if... I mean, I think she could still be a great swimmer. She could be a great swimmer... swimmer still. Yeah. Good. Good. I'm sorry. I don't know what I'm supposed to be saying right now. - It's the camera and... - No, it's good stuff. Great, really. You have a dynamic screen presence. So, so, Noah, umm... How old are you? I'm 29... years old. - Wow. - Wow. I don't know if this would interest you guys, but the rec center's spending some money to shoot a commercial here for local TV. Go on. Well, if you have some film, something that I could show my boss. Are you... are you serious? Yeah. I can't promise anything. Well, wow, we have some films, yes. Well, for how much? How much would you pay? Some of the films are in the early post-production phase, but if you give us some time-- Yeah, I mean obviously, for our expenses, cameras and lights and sound and labor, obviously, we'd have to get paid for that. By you. There are some sound and some technical issues with a few of the films. I hope you don't mind. We can fix it. Yeah, look, I think we can get something to you for let's say about $4,000. I think I can... we can show you some stuff. - It's not just, you know-- - Look-- It sounds good, it sounds good. Walk to me. Let go of the side and walk to me. I can't. I can't, Noah. My legs are shaking. I'm gonna fall in, man. You will not fall in. Good. Good. It's real good. OK? Now you've seen this before. We're going to blow bubbles. Nice and slow. Breathe in through your nose, blow out through your mouth. Let's try it again. Would you put this on 32 and 36, please? Uh-huh. No more bets. Nineteen. Red and odd. Don't be so surprised. It's depressing though, isn"t it? Been together for 27 years she said and they seem happy, right? I'm sorry, this is so not what you want to hear right now, is it? I met a guy. Sort of. Who? This guy, the other night at the casino. I didn't know you went there. Why didn't you come see me? I'm always afraid that you're gonna see me with this young guy and think I'm some divorcing middle-aged, ugh, I don't know. Anyway. He's nice. The guy. I mean, he's... Well, I don't know if "nice" is the right word, 'cause... he is kind of an asshole. But he's interesting. Well, I think that"s really great. Umm, the other night at my club, I gave... you know, Noah... a lap dance. Teacher Noah?! Yeah. I... Well... Did he like it? I think so. No. I mean, yeah, of course, he liked it. Wow. Wow. Well... jeez. Why are we here so early? We have to make an introduction... Huh? I'd just like to know who put that on the wall. OK. Here's what we're going to do today. I want you to grab your buddy and start at this end of the wall. Two, four, six. Paula, where's Marybeth at? She didn't show. OK. I, uh... I guess I'll partner up with you. - OK. - Unless... Carl, you want to give this a shot? No, man. I'm fine. I'm just gonna watch for a little bit, OK? OK. OK, let's go, everybody. You didn't call me back, buddy. I'm sorry, I, uh... I've just been really busy. Let's talk about this after class. OK? Now, um, let me see your breaststroke. - Right here? - Yeah. You know, you can see anything you want. That's great. Don't give up. Come on. Do it all the way back. I keep getting water up my nose. - What are you doing? - What? Stop. For today, please. Hey, Jordan? Ah, I hope it's all right with... me inviting your brother to class. The rec center was thinking about spending some money - on advertising so-- - Yeah, it's fine. Hello? Is anyone in here? Hey. Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh, God, no! Oh, no, I'm sorry! What the fuck?! Oww! - I am so sorry, Noah. - It's OK. Can you see anything? It really burns without the towel on, so I don't know. - Is your knee bleeding? - Probably. - Oh, man. - Yep. Yeah, my knee's bleeding. That's your bad knee too, isn't it? We should put some ice on that. Do you have any painkillers? No. I think I have some of my mom's Xanax. That can't hurt. Yeah, OK. You don't have to stay. No. I feel too guilty. I'm taking care of you. What did you want anyway? Sneaking up on me in the parking lot. Nothing. Oh. Nothing. To apologize. For coming into your club. So, what happened to your knee? Originally? I was doing this... cocky little jog that I did. My mind was on people watching me and... the next dive. I didn't see this little kid laying on the side of the pool and I tripped over him. I fractured my skull and detached my kneecap. Did you like lose a scholarship or something? No. No. I was out of college already. And you were still diving? I was training for the Olympics. So... You don't know if you would have made it into the Olympics or not? That must be unbearable. No. It's unbearable knowing I would have made it for sure. Good morning. Good morning. How are your eyes? I can see. Good. Uh, I slept on your couch. - Sorry, I just passed out. - You could have slept in here. Can you walk my dog? I hate to ask, but I... Yeah.

Look, do I have a chance of keeping my job here? Because I would really like to. I've actually given a lot of thought to leaving my position here, and my life here, for you. And I have come to this conclusion. I have been here a lot longer than you have. I have been here almost 15 years. You've been here three. And I'm sorry, I... I just won't do it. OK. Did you tell Scott and Diane Bergman that I was sleeping with somebody? A man in California? Here you go. Where you been? Uh, at home, sleeping mostly. Good for you, man. Yeah. Have a good one. I am going to resign right after graduation. Thank you, Amy. I think you've made the right decision. In fact, I've already spoken to the superintendent about you and as soon as a position becomes available at another school, you'll be first in line with my highest recommendation. OK. You know, I, uh... I think you're a class act, Amy. I just want you to know that I'm, I'm very impressed. Well, that means the world to me.

Well, you have my email, so just keep in touch, right? Great. - Who was that? - Ah, I don't know. You just wave around here. That's what you do. - Oh. - Oh! I'm sorry. I got to stop. - Oh, that's OK. - I'm out of shape. You all right? Ohh! Yeah. You remember my sister I was telling you about? The one with diabetes? She's going to open her own restaurant. Yeah. Sure. Well, they're opening soon and they don't have a, um, you know... Name for the restaurant? No. A hostess. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. And I told her about you. You know, that we're friends and that you look the part and you're a reliable person. It's going to be a pretty fancy place. With, you know... - Food? - Right. Well, anyway, I don"t know if you're interested, but the job pays terrifically. What? Nothing. I said something wrong. Yeah. What, now you have a problem with what I do? It... Look. It just came out wrong. No. You don"t even have a job. You be a goddamn hostess, or don't you need the money? OK, wait. Let's just take a moment and calm down. I'm not one of your students.

Really? How many guys spanked your ass tonight? Apparently not enough. 'Cause I'm still in a pretty shitty mood. Fuck you and everybody else that's in a bad mood all the time. Where is your dog? That dog is staying upstairs tonight. Leave him alone. Do you have a phone? What? Do you have a telephone? I'd like to call my mom. Tell her I'm staying out tonight, so she doesn't worry. 'Cause she worries all the time. About nothing. She's nuts. No. You don"t have a phone? It's broken. OK. Do you have a cell phone? I'll get it. Don't you want to fuck me or something?

This is the last time you're gonna see me before the final. Julia? What time is the final? Friday at 1:00. Ahem! Ah, look out. Big news. Uh... No, this is... Oh, well, announcement coming at end of next period. Thank you. OK. Goodbye. Good luck. Hey, email me if you have any questions. Who are you? Substitute. Ah, way to do something with your life. Tell me about it. Hi. Um... Thank you. That's very sweet. Um... I'm sorry I haven't been returning any of your calls lately. What happened to, uh, blackboards? Ah, we don't use them anymore. It's all dry erase now. Wacky. So, listen, um... It's weird that I came here. No, no. It's not that, it's, uh... It's that... This is just all a little weird for me right now. Well, this, um, makes it easier because I was actually coming here to tell you... it's all over, you know, between us. With the flowers. Well... To ease your pain. Well... Thanks anyway. Is it 'cause I came here? No. Um... I... I want... to be alone right now. I think it's a really important step. I agree. And like I said, You know, I hope the flowers help you in this time of, um... transition. I didn't come here to break up with you. That was a lie. OK. OK. And I'm not an astronaut. Hi. Hi. OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry... I was a jerk. No, no. I'm sorry. I... Good intentions or not, that was, yeah, that was me being judgmental. OK. Cool. So are we OK? I feel better. Time, everybody. Since this is our last swim class, I want to invite everybody-- Excuse me? I'm sorry. My lovely wife and I want to take this opportunity-- - Your who? Your wife? - Joanna. She's trying to get me involved. Joanna wants to invite you people to come to our first big bad summer pool party. - That's right. - This Thursday at our place. We got a new pool; that's why we're taking the class. Anyway, we want you all to come, and it's been a real pleasure taking the class with all of you. Well, with some of you. Um... Like Martin said, it's been an absolute pleasure for me as well. You guys are my last class here and it's been my honor to teach you all. Aww! Umm... And since this is your last class as well, is there anything else you want to learn? I have some crappy prizes. Some gift certificates from the gym. We could... we could run relay races. We wanna see you dive. Yeah. Dive. - Dive. - Dive, dive. Come on. This is gonna hurt. Do it again. Yeah! Do it again! You know, it took them a month before they even put those posters up. Are you sure these people are gonna be better pet owners than you? I agree. Screw them. Let's just go to the pool party. Guys, the dog belongs to a kid. Oh... Oh, no. Noah, I'm sorry. Bye, Danger. Noah. Stinky. Mr. Douglass. You want a drink? Sure. You want a beer? Uh, yeah. I'll have whatever you're having. - There you go. - Thank you. You, uhh, got a new dog. Not my idea. I was glad when the first fucking dog was gone. Jason, my son, he really wanted to put those signs up. I said, "Look at it this way. If the dog was happy here with you, it wouldn't have run off in the first place." Quiet, Peanut! But he's a kid, you know, pretty fond of animals. So, my wife... well, my ex-wife now, convinced me to buy a new dog. And that was the last we heard of Stinky around here. Pffft! So, was that guy at school the other day your son, Mrs. Pierson? You know what, Hunter? I'm not a teacher anymore, so screw you. Well, I'm not a student anymore, Amy, so why don't you go-- Hey! Jason must have been happy to hear about Stinky. I haven't told him yet about you and your call. You haven't? Noah, I'm a writer. I am home all the time. So, it's pretty much my responsibility to take care of this fucking dog. And I don't want another dog. OK? Really? So, I was hoping, if you wouldn't mind holding onto that little shit for us. Maybe bring him around sometime? No, I wouldn't mind. Not at all. - Hey, what happened? - I don't know. - Do you get to keep him? - Yes. Awesome! Danger! - Honey, they brought something. - Get me a beer. Whoa! Maestro, good to see you. Welcome. Hey, welcome to my dirty little secret. Officer, keep this guy off my coconuts. I got him. Hi there. - Hey, how are you? - How old are you? Me? Yeah, I'm, uh... 20... 24. Uh-huh. And you are? - I'm 31 years old. - Thirty-one years old. - Every year after that... - Yeah. - We can win any time. - Yeah, I love this. The curse is broken. Eighty-six consecutive losing years and they got a curse, instead of they suck. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Jordan's your sister? - Excuse me? Isn't Jordan your sister, and you're making that documentary about her? Yeah, yeah. Exactly. That's really cool. Jordan's really tall. Yep. You coming? Uh, go ahead, I'll catch you up. All right. Yeah. Uh, yeah, yeah, she's, uh... she's pretty tall. Oh, please. Fucking, please. All right. Um... Really, I don't know where it stands right now. Jordan, you're healthy, you're smart, and look at you, you're a knockout. Unfortunately, um, I am currently unemployed. Me, too. You are gonna love it. Hey, this is my kid. Can you say hello? Hi. Hey, I'm Noah. I'm Martin. This is my house. Don't wreck it. So, I heard you're gonna go swimming. - Dad, can we go swimming? - In a few minutes, OK, buddy? It's this really good documentary. It's about this guy named Robert Crumb. He's an artist and... I just saw it for the first time the other day. That's... That's just so weird that you would recommend that. I'm sorry, how old are you? Hey. Hey. Noah. Noah! Noah, you better watch this, baby. - I'm watching. - Catch it. This is for you, for teaching me how to swim, buddy. - Yeah! But most of all, guys, listen, most of all this is for my son. - Hey! - All right! This is for my son. This is for you, buddy. Ten-point-0, right here. Go, buddy. Come on guys, let me hear it. Yeah! He actually did it! That's really good, pal. Oh, my God, Karen? You look great! Thanks. Jennifer, how's it going? You lost so much of that weight. Yes. I started working out here at the New London Rec Center. Hi. I'm Noah Owens. Are you tired of just sitting at home, watching bad TV? How about an exciting game of basketball? Or a challenging game of squash? Or, take a relaxing dip in our indoor pool and meet some interesting people. It doesn't matter if you're young and energetic... or old.
