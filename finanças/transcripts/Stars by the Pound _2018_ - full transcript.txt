The universe is big, ﻿super big. ﻿Our solar system alone is 9.09 billion kilometers. ﻿And the planets in it aren't all the same size. ﻿For instance, the biggest is Jupiter. ﻿But no one bothers big, old Jupiter. ﻿There's tons of space in the universe. ﻿It's totally obese though. ﻿It would take 1,321 Earth-sized bodies to fill up the volume of Jupiter. ﻿The inhabitants of Jupiter are Jovians. ﻿Their problem is room. ﻿Coming through! ﻿Jovians love Earthlings' food so much ﻿that their bodies store it all. ﻿That's why they're this shape. ﻿Earthlings shack up with Jovians sometimes. ﻿That's what's called not seeing shit! ﻿I'm Lois, like Superman's girlfriend. ﻿He isn't an Earthling either. ﻿Come eat! ﻿No thanks! ﻿Next to Jupiter, his planet Krypton is like a luxury hotel. ﻿COMPETITION ﻿WIN A ZERO-G FLIGHT ﻿On Jupiter, all specular reflection is banned. ﻿That's when an object appears in a reflective surface ﻿and reflects the exact same light to the observer. ﻿The only thing worth remembering is... life ﻿on Jupiter basically isn't an option. ﻿STARS BY THE POUND ﻿I was a student here 10 years ago and I had your teacher. ﻿Proof it’ll get you somewhere! ﻿For sure! It certainly did me. ﻿I'm now an engineer at the CNES, ﻿the National Center for Space Studies. ﻿Our job is to plan space missions. ﻿We not only send machines ﻿but spacecraft with astronauts inside them too. ﻿Lois, let me introduce you to Mathieu. ﻿Hello, Lois. ﻿Hello. ﻿Lois is my best student. ﻿She's passionate, hard-working... ﻿A bit reserved too. ﻿She's entering the CNES junior competition. ﻿Could you take a look at her project? ﻿- Sure, no problem. - Show him. ﻿- Do you have it here? - She's really into it. ﻿The aim of my project is to collect air in space. ﻿OK, all right. ﻿I figure I need a helium balloon probe to reach the stratosphere. ﻿All right. ﻿In the gondola, ﻿I’ve created a syringe system to collect the air. ﻿I've added a GPS unit too to locate it when it comes back. ﻿All right. ﻿- The transponder is the GPS? - That's right. ﻿OK. ﻿It's pretty good. ﻿Not bad, huh? ﻿Do you think I can win with this? ﻿I really couldn't say. ﻿There are going to be all sorts of different projects. ﻿But what I can say is, yours is really, really good. ﻿I can see you've worked hard and you know your stuff. ﻿Thank you. ﻿The thing is... Just so that you... ﻿It's an opportunity to realize you don't need to go into space ﻿to discover the universe. ﻿The thing is... ﻿I've discussed this with Mathieu. ﻿How many spacemen did the European Space Agency select last year? ﻿Six. ﻿- Out of 8,400 applicants... - 8,420 applicants. ﻿8,420. ﻿Yes. They were really... ﻿sporty, like top athletes. ﻿You have to be.. ﻿Physically, it's... ﻿Not everyone can be an astronaut. ﻿You see? ﻿I was thinking the other day... ﻿Stephen Hawking... ﻿Everyone's heard of him. He's handicapped ﻿but he's taught us much more ﻿than Neil Armstrong, say. ﻿- Sure. - Ever thought about that? ﻿Mathieu... it's the same thing. ﻿Planning space missions is fascinating. ﻿No, er, yes, sorry. ﻿That's right, it's fascinating. In ﻿any case, if you like space.. ﻿It's great he's here, you two can talk about it. ﻿- Did you do a prep class? - Yes. There are loads. ﻿You'll have to choose so it'd be good to chat ﻿about which direction to take. ﻿I don't need you! ﻿I've chosen my prep class. ﻿All right. ﻿What's wrong? ﻿Hang on, I've got something ﻿that'll make you feel better. ﻿I brought... It isn't much. ﻿Just a small gift. It's a parachute for your probe. ﻿- Awesome! - The literature... ﻿Are you OK? ﻿Lois! ﻿90/60. ﻿The school nurse says it's the 3rd time in a month. ﻿If you don't eat, you'll damage your body. ﻿You'll be sick, you'll keep fainting. ﻿- I'm not sick. - Sure! ﻿I'm not sick, I don't faint. ﻿If you don't eat, there'll be no competition in Toulouse. ﻿Leave this to me. ﻿What's this? ﻿You have to stop, Lois. ﻿You can't have what you want. ﻿Just look. ﻿Go on. ﻿When I was 20, I had a gastric ring fitted. ﻿It didn't work. ﻿So for my 25th birthday, I had a gastrectomy. ﻿Do you know what that is, Lois? ﻿Look at me. ﻿It's when this is removed. ﻿Then I had a bypass. ﻿I almost died. Your dad saved me. ﻿Don't make the same mistakes as me. ﻿Dad and I are here. ﻿Hello, my girl. Hello, honey. How are you? ﻿We're here, sweetie. ﻿Hello. ﻿Easy. ﻿Stay still, sweetie. ﻿Be calm. ﻿Where are we? ﻿At the hospital. ﻿You gave us such a scare. ﻿Just stay in bed, honey. ﻿No! I have to go to Toulouse. ﻿You almost died, Lois. ﻿Why did you have kids with a fatso? ﻿I'll wait outside. ﻿I wanna go to the competition. ﻿Are you gonna take me? ﻿What's got into you? ﻿This isn't like you, honey. ﻿It isn't like you at all. ﻿Upsetting your mom, hurting yourself. What is this? ﻿We're your parents. You can't speak to us like that! Honey... ﻿Come on, Lois. ﻿I'll go see Mom. Get some rest. ﻿You OK? ﻿Parents are meant to take a hit. ﻿Or what's the point? ﻿Do you have a tissue? ﻿Use the sheet. They'll get changed. ﻿No way. ﻿- That's gross. - You're gross, Stannah. - How long have I been here? - I don't work here! ﻿You got here the day before yesterday. ﻿They thought you were dead. ﻿I knew you weren't. ﻿Know why? ﻿I've already seen a corpse. ﻿When you die, ﻿the blood rushes down. ﻿So you look like a popsicle. ﻿Blueberry and vanilla. ﻿Get the picture? ﻿Ending up like a popsicle sucks. ﻿Would you like to see that? ﻿We could try it out here. ﻿Breathe out slowly. ﻿All the way. ﻿Now breathe normally. ﻿I see what you're trying to do, ﻿but it isn't that simple. ﻿Some folk are tall, others short. Same with weight. ﻿It's a question of metabolism. ﻿One thing's for certain, stopping eating is pointless. ﻿In fact, ﻿you should start eating again. ﻿That way, we can remove your feeding tube. ﻿Sound good? ﻿What do you think? ﻿POLYSTYRENE SHEETS ﻿SURVIVAL BLANKET ﻿Hurry up, I have to take you back. ﻿Other girls are waiting. ﻿You've got 2 minutes. ﻿They're watching us. ﻿They're scared we'll puke our guts out. ﻿You eating the ceiling? ﻿Feeling peckish? ﻿I need a favor. I got my camera back. ﻿But the nurses are on to me. ﻿You gotta hide it. ﻿I don't give a shit. ﻿- You don't? - Give me a break. ﻿You're so fucking mean. ﻿They don't know you. ﻿What d'you want? Smokes? ﻿Booze? ﻿I want to go into space. ﻿Can you fix that? ﻿No. ﻿No one can. ﻿I know a way. ﻿We jack a few bags of Jerome's white powder. ﻿You'll be in space in no time! ﻿Don't talk crap. I'm ﻿opening the door now. ﻿Unbelievable! ﻿- Give us some privacy. - Come out. - It's been an hour! - I'm really constipated. ﻿Open this door. Now. ﻿You're 19 and you're acting like you're 5. ﻿Come out now! ﻿Sure, come on in. You gonna wipe me too? ﻿Stand on here. ﻿I'm no pro but it's kinda like this. ﻿What you doing, dancing? ﻿What? ﻿How is it then? ﻿Oh yeah, hang on, on the moon, they do this. ﻿That isn't it! ﻿You're not even trying. Show me. ﻿- I bet you know. - No way. ﻿This isn't space. ﻿You suck! ﻿When you see me in the video, you're gonna regret it. ﻿Everyone'll think I was in space. ﻿How do astronauts move on the moon? ﻿There's less gravity for starters. ﻿Because it's the moon... ﻿it's easier. ﻿I dunno... ﻿like this. ﻿Go on, I'll follow you. ﻿Next. ﻿I said no. ﻿Next. ﻿I don't want you to push me! ﻿Suit yourself. ﻿About fucking time. ﻿I hate her damn lapdog. ﻿Is Stannah her first name? ﻿No! Stannah's a stairlift brand. ﻿That thing for oldies. ﻿It's me who came up with it. Cool, huh? ﻿She took to it right away. ﻿Why did it hurt less when I didn't eat? ﻿When you don't eat, your body makes hormones ﻿so you don't feel tired and stuff. ﻿Hormones are like drugs, girl. ﻿They make you high. ﻿Check this out. ﻿Please stop, it hurts. ﻿- Ah, that's better! - It hurts. ﻿It stinks. ﻿Tell me again about what we'll win at that competition. ﻿The zero-G flight. ﻿Sure you want to go? ﻿What about your folks? ﻿I don't give a crap. They're assholes. ﻿They don't even come visit anymore. ﻿It suits me fine. I don't wanna see them either. ﻿Come on, tell me about this zero-G. ﻿You're on a plane, ﻿and it goes really high. ﻿You're inside, ﻿and when it drops, ﻿you drop too. ﻿For 20 seconds, ﻿it's like you're in space. ﻿You're weightless. ﻿For 20 seconds, ﻿you don't feel your weight, ﻿you don't feel your body. ﻿Wicked. ﻿But how high is 45-km altitude? ﻿It's the beginning of space. Only spacemen go up there. ﻿How will we sneak out? ﻿That's super easy. It's the rest that'll be tough. ﻿Even so though. ﻿You watch too many movies. ﻿Everyone's here voluntarily. ﻿Really? ﻿No one asked me about it. ﻿There are emergency cases too. ﻿What about you? ﻿I did it for my folks. ﻿Have you already run away then? ﻿Not from here but from other centers. ﻿Fuck! That bitch is at it again. ﻿It wasn't me. ﻿You're a pain! ﻿To work out which color will enhance you, ﻿you have to know one thing... ﻿your skin's undertones. ﻿In other words, we're going to see which colors ﻿make you look beautiful. ﻿So when would we go? ﻿Wearing colors that suit you... ﻿Toulouse is an 8-hour drive. ﻿So if we leave tomorrow, ﻿we'll be there in two days. ﻿The simplest way is to look at the veins on your wrists. ﻿If they're green, you have a warm skin tone. ﻿If they're blue, you have a cold skin tone. ﻿If they're not blue or green, ﻿you have a neutral skin tone. ﻿Your skin's undertones... We want to come with you. We ain't taking that baggage. ﻿It isn't out of your way. ﻿We drop Justine in the Limousin. I just want out. - What the fuck's she gonna do there? - Live in a cave. ﻿With no electromagnetic waves... ﻿Right, girls... ﻿could you please stop talking? ﻿This could actually be useful. ﻿But, miss, I was just explaining to her ﻿about the tone's underskins. - The skin's undertones. - Precisely. ﻿She gets it now. ﻿Don't you? ﻿She does. ﻿Right, colors... ﻿They give you energy and a real radiance... ﻿- I just want out of here. - Dream on! ﻿We're going to do an exercise. ﻿I have a clothes rack... - We have a competition. - Who gives a crap? ﻿Find another babysitter! ﻿I can take care of Justine. We just want to go with you. ﻿Give me a break! ﻿- What's the problem? - We don't want you. - Stop busting my balls! - What's the problem? ﻿Quiet. Right... - Damn! What's going on? - It wasn't me. ﻿What's going on? ﻿Will this convince you? - It doesn't work. - Hang on. ﻿Why doesn't it work? ﻿The pass doesn't work. - Stannah, it doesn't work. - Just a second. ﻿What the fuck is this? ﻿Your canteen pass? You've fucking screwed us! ﻿No way! I stole it, OK? ﻿I don't know what's wrong. ﻿You're such a jerk. ﻿Let's go. We'll try tomorrow, OK? ﻿No. We've gotta leave tonight. ﻿- We leave tomorrow. - No! ﻿We won't get there in time. ﻿- Fucking come on! - We've gotta open this door. ﻿- Drop it, Lois. - No fucking way! ﻿I want out! I'm going to the competition. ﻿I wanna go to the competition! ﻿What the fuck? ﻿- What are you doing? - I wanna get out. ﻿You're nuts. ﻿Get a move on. Justine, hurry! ﻿Hurry the fuck up! ﻿Shut up! ﻿I'm gonna kill you! ﻿Folks don't even feel sorry for the disabled. ﻿You're useless! ﻿And you're a sorry sight. ﻿Fucking weirdo! ﻿I should've told you to go back to your room. ﻿-Why didn’t I? - We'd be fine without you. ﻿Now we're on a shitty road ﻿with a fucking dumbass! ﻿That's fucking all! ﻿We’re just... ﻿Thanks a lot. The train was too expensive. ﻿Yeah, the train's a rip-off. ﻿Your funeral is in Toulouse, huh? ﻿That's right, Toulouse. ﻿Could we stop here first? ﻿- What the fuck's this? - My cave. ﻿Not going to the funeral? ﻿Yes. We all are. ﻿Don't touch that. ﻿- You OK in the back? - Justine, stop. ﻿Are you OK? ﻿Fine. Stop that. ﻿Whose funeral is it? ﻿- My grandma's. - A friend's. ﻿A friend's grandma's. ﻿Where d'you meet? ﻿We're at college. ﻿Studying what? ﻿Psych. ﻿I'm not going to Toulouse. ﻿I'll drop you somewhere. ﻿I'll be right back. ﻿How are you? Is everything OK? ﻿Yes, fine. Dad, you've got to take me to Toulouse ﻿for the competition. It's in two days. Please. ﻿OK. But where are you? Who are you with? ﻿The other girls from the center. ﻿We're in a hotel somewhere. ﻿See if there's a brochure. ﻿It'll say at the bottom the name of the town or... ﻿The other girls are a bit crazy. ﻿I want to apologize for what I said to Mom. ﻿I need to know where you are so we can come get you. ﻿The police are here... Hang on! ﻿- The police are here. It's a mess. - The police? ﻿Actually, forget it. ﻿I can manage. It's OK. ﻿- Don't tell Mom. - She wants a word. ﻿No. I'm going to the competition. ﻿OK, but don't hang up. ﻿Talk to me. ﻿Bitch! ﻿Get lost, fatso. ﻿Jean-Luc? ﻿- What? - Let's go. ﻿- Where? - Toulouse! ﻿Why go to Toulouse? ﻿- It's pointless. - What? ﻿- It's pointless to go to Toulouse. -Why? ﻿- Because she isn't there. - What? ﻿Because she isn't there. ﻿Where is she? ﻿She's on the way to Guiana. ﻿She wants to go in a rocket so she's... ﻿Don't worry, I'll call the airports. ﻿Why aren't you in bed? ﻿Why isn't she in bed? It's 1 AM and she's still up. ﻿Of course! ﻿Amelie's locked herself in the bathroom. ﻿She's making herself sick. ﻿Afraid you won't get to Toulouse in time? ﻿Yes. ﻿What happened earlier was normal. ﻿We're at the center for a reason. ﻿That's why they lock us in. We're a bit different, see? ﻿Amelie, let me in. ﻿Come on. ﻿Go away! ﻿I'm sorry, OK. ﻿You're a jerk. ﻿Go home to your fatso family! ﻿I need to pee. ﻿Amelie? ﻿Heard of Buzz Aldrin? ﻿I don't give a fuck! ﻿You haven't? ﻿Apollo 11? ﻿The first moon landing? ﻿Neil Armstrong? ﻿I bet you know him. ﻿The first man to walk on the moon. ﻿Buzz Aldrin was the second. ﻿He did a crazy thing up there. ﻿Imagine... ﻿the first moon landing. ﻿It's barren, gray. ﻿Buzz Aldrin was bummed. ﻿He was stuck in the module, Armstrong was walking on the moon. ﻿But that was the flight plan. ﻿He had to wait 20 seconds. ﻿As he's second, no one will remember him. ﻿See? So... ﻿he thinks, "What can I do ﻿"while he's living his dream and I'm stuck in here?" ﻿Do you know what he did? ﻿What? ﻿The guy ﻿was balancing, ﻿one leg inside, one on the ladder. ﻿He did something no one had ever done before. ﻿He peed in his urine pouch. ﻿Imagine that. ﻿He wasn't the first man on the moon ﻿but he was the first to pee on it! ﻿It's wild. ﻿Cool. ﻿So basically my catheter's gross but Buzz Aldrin is stylin'? ﻿You'll always be gross! ﻿Here you go. ﻿That'll be 55 euros, please. ﻿Am I the only one with cash? ﻿Pains in the ass. ﻿Thank you. ﻿OK, thanks. ﻿Excuse me! ﻿You have to pay the deposit. ﻿The room has been damaged. ﻿- It's 300 euros. - 300? ﻿What's been damaged? ﻿If it's the radiator, it was making an odd noise anyway. ﻿We couldn't find you to tell you. ﻿I'm telling you, Muriel, ﻿it isn't personal ﻿but the service is substandard. ﻿It isn't just the radiator, there's the phone. ﻿Yes, the phone... ﻿It was broken. ﻿It was working fine yesterday. ﻿It wasn't. That's why we couldn't call you. ﻿That's right. And I must say I found it worrying. ﻿What if there's a fire? ﻿Yeah, imagine there's a fire. ﻿I mean, I'm sorry but I can't go down a fire escape. ﻿I depend on you, and if I can't reach you... ﻿It isn't normal. ﻿I'll speak to my manager. ﻿You do that. ﻿- Fuck! - I don't have 300 euros. ﻿Me neither. ﻿How about you? Seeing as you broke the radiator. ﻿- I didn't do anything. - Sure you didn't! ﻿Who's gonna pay? We don't have 300 euros. ﻿I don't either. ﻿- What are you doing? - Hang on. ﻿- Come here! - Fuck! ﻿Come here! ﻿You're a wheelchair delinquent! ﻿Shut up. ﻿What are you doing? ﻿Seeing if your office meets requirements. ﻿- What? - See this? I can't get through. ﻿I belong to an association, ﻿and what we do is check the facilities.. ﻿You OK? ﻿- Are you hurt? - ...designed for the disabled. ﻿I'm stuck now. ﻿- Excuse me. - No. Be careful. ﻿- I do this often. - We carry out checks all over. ﻿You can't imagine... ﻿Mind that. ﻿the number of violations there are. ﻿Be careful. ﻿I don't intend to report you but if you get a more difficult guest... ﻿you'll pay thousands in compensation. ﻿She's gonna cry all day. ﻿How come you can't drive? ﻿I can. I'm still learning. ﻿An astronaut who can't drive! ﻿We'll be at the cave in an hour. ﻿We'll drop Justine there. What about you? ﻿Toulouse is perfect. ﻿Put your cig out. It's going in Justine's face. ﻿What? ﻿- Your cig. - What's that? ﻿Put your cig out! ﻿Stop! ﻿It's beautiful. ﻿It isn't exactly cozy ﻿but it isn't bad for a cave. ﻿We'll be’off then. OK. ﻿Bye. ﻿- Coming? - In a minute. ﻿You can stay if you want. ﻿There are no waves here. ﻿No wifi, no cancer, no disease. ﻿Who had cancer? ﻿My little brother. ﻿When Dad put in wifi at home. ﻿It isn't just me, you know. ﻿Really? ﻿No. It's called electrosensitivity. ﻿It's peaceful. ﻿Lois! Move your fat ass or I'll sign up without you. ﻿Right. ﻿Bye. ﻿Let's get out of here. ﻿Wait for me! ﻿- There she is. - See you! ﻿Hey, stop! ﻿Wait for me. It isn't funny. ﻿Toulouse! ﻿How many can go on your zero-G flight? ﻿Two, tops! ﻿Your turn. ﻿I want to film the journey. ﻿We'll see the take-off, ﻿the clouds, ﻿the stars, ﻿like we're really there. ﻿Your turn. ﻿I want to fly away in it. ﻿Fuck other people! You're great as you are. ﻿That's easy for you to say. ﻿You're like a size-zero model. ﻿You weigh nothing, girl! ﻿You think I want to look like some dumbass model? ﻿My ass and breasts disgust me. ﻿You think I like my big ass and breasts? ﻿Or the stretch marks on my body? ﻿You two can't be serious! ﻿Look at me for a second. ﻿Talking about fat butts and tiny butts! ﻿When did you last see mine? ﻿No one sees mine, no one's looked at it in years. ﻿We can swap if you like. ﻿I'd happily have your fat ass or your tiny ass. ﻿Want my pressure relief cushion? ﻿You jerk! ﻿I'm keeping my ass. ﻿I don't want yours anyways. I prefer Lois's. ﻿I hate you. ﻿And you, Justine, which do you prefer? ﻿The flat ass or the big booty? ﻿I'm not sure. ﻿But... ﻿I've been thinking and... ﻿I figure the zero-G flight might rid me of my OCD. ﻿I can't help it! ﻿Here. ﻿We have something for you, Justine. ﻿It's a gift. ﻿Here. ﻿An anti-electromagnetic wave helmet. ﻿I saw it on TV. ﻿They said it was like ﻿a shield that stops waves within a 3-meter radius. ﻿- That's it, huh? - It's a cover like those ﻿you get on satellites. ﻿It works. ﻿It works! ﻿Hey girls, this is it. ﻿Cherry boy territory! ﻿So the CanSat has a greater mass. ﻿I'm going to work at NOMAC. ﻿I've been working a bit to earn money ﻿so my folks don't have to... ﻿The fact is, ﻿a supporting structure isn't a better idea. ﻿The CanSat was at this level, so it really tilted. ﻿\Ne managed though... ﻿How high does that go? ﻿You mean..., the altitude? ﻿Yeah, obviously. ﻿1,500 meters, with the drag. ﻿Fuck, did you hear that? ﻿It only reaches 1,500 meters. ﻿We'll crush them! ﻿Hello. ﻿The equipment you require... ﻿A balloon and some helium. ﻿You’ll need to do a pre-selection oral. ﻿Fucking hell! ﻿Quit it. ﻿So... tomorrow at 10:15 AM ﻿you present your project in front of the jury. ﻿The balloon probe is great ﻿but the syringe system isn't going to cut it. ﻿We need to think bigger and better. ﻿- Need something for your gears? - Yeah. ﻿- That lot have loads. Go ask them. ﻿-I checked. - It has to fit in the base. ﻿Give me the dimensions. ﻿OK, I get the picture... ﻿I have to go back to the store. Another 2 hours wasted! ﻿Just get up. ﻿- What for? - There's no need to go the store. ﻿There is. I don't have any. ﻿Put your head down. ﻿Do this. ﻿Er... what now? ﻿Go back. ﻿Go on. ﻿Excuse me. ﻿Do you have a spare gearwheel? ﻿Thanks. ﻿Thanks who? ﻿Thanks, Stannah. ﻿They're so predictable. ﻿This must've taken ages to learn. ﻿I have loads of time. I don't have internet or TV. ﻿So... ﻿It's wild. I couldn't do this with a needle and thread. ﻿Me neither. You need fabric too! ﻿Hi girls. ﻿Hey. ﻿I'm reminding you all what time your oral is. ﻿What’s your project number? ﻿I don't know. ﻿Me neither. ﻿You're an all-girl group, right? ﻿OK. You're the only one. ﻿We'd noticed! ﻿So you're... ﻿Lois, right? ﻿No. ﻿OK, then you must be Sarah? ﻿That's right. ﻿OK, Sarah. I actually knew that. ﻿You did? ﻿What if I try to guess your name? ﻿- Don't say anything, OK? - I won't. ﻿I'd say you look like... ﻿a Joachim. ﻿Yeah, but that's easy. ﻿I didn't see your badge. ﻿If I take this off... you don't know my name. ﻿I'd better put it back on. ﻿Right, so your time tomorrow... ﻿I just have to find it. ﻿It's OK, we know the time. 10:15. ﻿Right, well, work hard. ﻿Bye. ﻿Where are you going? ﻿- Fuck! -Wait. ﻿Hang on. ﻿- Fucking hell! - Wait. ﻿Hang on, it's stuck. Stop! ﻿Stop. ﻿Fuck. ﻿Why isn't it working? ﻿Shit! ﻿Maybe the battery's dead? ﻿God, I'm dumb! I didn't think of that. ﻿At this hour... ﻿it isn't easy to think. ﻿This is exactly like Martian soil. ﻿Exactly? ﻿So... ﻿what's your syringe for? ﻿Are you measuring particles? ﻿It isn't for particles. It's an air collector I'm testing. ﻿That's cool. ﻿What's your project then? ﻿I'm doing terraforming. ﻿Basically, we send up a CanSat. ﻿When it lands, it extends... ﻿a rod that makes a hole in the ground and... ﻿plants a seed. ﻿That's brilliant. ﻿Your probe looks great. ﻿Is this your first competition? ﻿Have you done others? ﻿This is my sixth. ﻿Last time I was in the top 15. ﻿Right. ﻿Which prep class will you do? ﻿I'm aiming for SUPAERO Toulouse. ﻿I'd love to be a flight director here. ﻿What do you want to do? ﻿I don't know. ﻿Should I have measured particles? ﻿What? ﻿Should I have measured cosmic rays with my probe? ﻿I was just saying that. ﻿What are you up to? ﻿- Sorry. - I couldn't find you. ﻿I'd better get back to work. ﻿Good luck. ﻿Thanks. ﻿Who was that guy? ﻿What were you talking about? ﻿Mind your own business. ﻿What are you doing? ﻿This air collector sucks! It's too simple. ﻿We need to measure cosmic rays. ﻿I'm chucking all this. The Geiger counter is bulky. ﻿What counter? ﻿We don't have one. ﻿We'll ask for one. ﻿Our probe is fine as it is! ﻿- Stop! You'll ruin it. - What about our air thing? ﻿It's crap! - It is? - ﻿Yeah. ﻿I liked it. ﻿It sucks! ﻿What did that guy say? ﻿Who? ﻿Drop it! ﻿Do you even know what a Geiger counter is? ﻿No! ﻿Or a cosmic ray either. ﻿So there! ﻿Not my camera. ﻿It's fucking mine! ﻿Hands off. - ﻿It's mine! - Let go! ﻿It's my probe, you ball-breaker! ﻿Why don't we ask her where her counter would go? ﻿So you'd put your counter here? ﻿All right. ﻿This is the parachute. ﻿How cute! It's embroidered. ﻿Hang on, I'm protecting myself! ﻿Nice helmet! ﻿Don't forget your gears. ﻿Not as cute as her. ﻿Which channel was it on? ﻿Was what on? ﻿The report on the helmet that stops waves. ﻿How did it work? ﻿I don't really remember. ﻿But I'm not sure... I don't think I saw it on TV. ﻿It must've been on the net. ﻿Your probe is really pretty good. ﻿It's well designed too. ﻿Using an iPhone as a transponder is clever. ﻿But... ﻿as for the experiment in your gondola... ﻿we think it's rather dull. ﻿You should've come up with something more creative like... ﻿measuring pressure and altitude. ﻿Or the volumetric mass of air. ﻿I had an air collector system with syringes at first. ﻿- There you go! - That was a great idea. ﻿It's a shame. You'd have passed easily. ﻿Why did you change? ﻿I don't know. ﻿Don’t worry, you can try again next year. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Goodbye. ﻿You lied to me. It's a skate helmet. ﻿Why did you bring me here? ﻿No one forced you to come. ﻿Well? ﻿It's screwed. ﻿Fuck! ﻿Fuck. ﻿We should've gone with the first idea. ﻿I fucking told you so. ﻿I can't stay here. ﻿What now? ﻿Get lost then! ﻿Don't talk to her like that. ﻿What did she imagine? ﻿A cave or a helmet would stop her getting sick? ﻿Magic doesn't exist! ﻿Don't talk to her like that! I'm sorry, OK? ﻿What are you doing? ﻿Stop it! We can launch it. ﻿Fucking stop it! ﻿I'll never go into space anyways. ﻿Don't talk shit. You don't know that! ﻿I do! Look at me. ﻿I am. What? ﻿Look at them then. ﻿I don't see any difference. ﻿Can't you see I'm fat? I'll never go into space. ﻿Don't give me a hard time. ﻿Some zero-G flight won't change our shitty lives. ﻿What are you doing? ﻿Amelie, what are you doing? ﻿Remember the probe? ﻿We made it together. ﻿Remember that? ﻿You might not remember but we put my camera in it. We put her photo in it too. ﻿And her poem. ﻿Well, I'm gonna launch it. ﻿We made it, and I'm gonna launch it. ﻿I don't care if you don't want to. Destroy that if you like. ﻿I don't give a shit! Because we're launching this, OK? ﻿We're gonna launch it into space! That's what's happening. ﻿End of story! ﻿She's woken up. ﻿Not eating? ﻿No. I'm not hungry. ﻿How about something else? ﻿Not even a Chocsy-Choco-Crepe? Hard to say, easy to eat! ﻿I'm gonna prove Check this out. ﻿Crazy, huh? ﻿Jean-Luc. ﻿What? ﻿Wasn't your Guiana spiel enough? ﻿Hey, I apologized. ﻿How about to the other parents? ﻿It's my fault you're like that. ﻿All I've given you is my fat-ass body. ﻿Give it a break. ﻿I love your fat-ass body. ﻿You love this? ﻿Sure. ﻿You love it? ﻿And this? ﻿And this? ﻿You think your girls are happy? ﻿Like themselves? ﻿You don't see it, Jean-Luc. ﻿- I don't? - No. ﻿I don't see it? ﻿Whose fault do you think this is? ﻿I'm sick of you not loving yourself! ﻿Maybe if you did she wouldn't want to go into space. ﻿Listen when I say you're beautiful. ﻿That you're gorgeous. ﻿You know I'm crazy about exploring your body. ﻿Your body is... I love hurtling down its slopes. ﻿Your body is a big sand dune. Don't you see? ﻿I snuggle up and roll around in you. ﻿I come, I go, I climb it, descend it, scale it, hurtle down it. ﻿I'm content, hot, cold... ﻿It smells of spray. I love it! ﻿Don't you get that? ﻿Look, I love your big arms, big breasts, big belly and big ass, Jocelyne! ﻿Got that? ﻿Sorry, folks. ﻿Enjoy your meal. ﻿Do you hear me? ﻿Do you hear when I talk to you? ﻿Do you hear me? ﻿I think you're beautiful. ﻿Do you hear when I love you? ﻿Yes. ﻿You're beautiful. ﻿Hello. How can I help you? ﻿A balloon probe and a bottle of helium, please. ﻿Are you a contestant? ﻿Yes, er, no, not anymore. ﻿The reception area for contestants is in the grounds, outside. ﻿Yes, I know but... ﻿I'm out of the contest and I need to launch my probe. ﻿That's why I'd like to have a balloon and some helium. ﻿What I suggest is, you make an official request. ﻿You fill in a form, send it to Planet Science ﻿and you'll receive your balloon. ﻿But I want it now. ﻿Those are the rules, young lady. ﻿Goodbye. ﻿- Excuse me. - I'm not moving. ﻿What are you doing, young lady? ﻿I won't move till I get my balloon and helium. ﻿If you don't move, I'll have to call security. ﻿I won't move till I get my balloon and helium. ﻿You're staying put? ﻿You're sure? ﻿I'll call security then. ﻿Very well. ﻿Take her arms. ﻿On Jupiter, the force of gravity is 24.7 meters per second squared. ﻿Or 2.5 times that of Earth. ﻿So on Jupiter, I weigh 250 kilos. ﻿I am Jupiter, I weigh 250 kilos. ﻿Hello, Lois. ﻿This is the command center. ﻿Recognize him? ﻿He's doing an experiment on fluids. ﻿Is this live? It ﻿sure is! We communicate regularly. ﻿It's awesome. ﻿You're interested now, eh? ﻿Still want your balloon? ﻿Yes. ﻿Hang on tight, girls! ﻿Lois, they're coming! ﻿We launch it at zero, OK? See ya! ﻿Bon voyage! ﻿Hey, space! ﻿For 20 seconds, ﻿it's like you're in space. ﻿You're weightless. ﻿You don't feel your weight. ﻿You don't feel your body. ﻿Hi, biatch! ﻿I'm writing you from the dorks center. I'm stuck here for now. ﻿We're gonna talk about my leaving, but they're taking me for a ride. ﻿There's a guy who's been here 3 years. ﻿They've put me on my own for busting my roommate's balls. ﻿But I'm easy to get along with, so I don't see why. ﻿I think of you lot sometimes and I miss you. ﻿You, obviously, but even those other two dorks. ﻿By the way, Stairlift Stannah wrote me. ﻿She's got herself a guy, who's into Untouchable too. ﻿Enjoy your cherry boys' class and don't forget me, ﻿or I'll kill you when I get out. ﻿In my cherry boys' class, I'm gonna write you. ﻿Make sure you get out soon, so we can meet up, OK? ﻿There's a surprise in the envelope. ﻿I bet you've guessed what it is. ﻿I miss you all too. ﻿It's kinda like gravity in physics. ﻿When objects attract each other. ﻿The force acts at a distance. ﻿The objects are affected without being touched. ﻿There's a really strong inner pressure. ﻿PURE AIR ﻿And it traces their path forever. ﻿And you'll see, ﻿at an altitude of 45 km, ﻿everything is clearer. ﻿At an altitude of 45 km, ﻿you can see how beautiful Earth is. ﻿Subtitles: hvq
