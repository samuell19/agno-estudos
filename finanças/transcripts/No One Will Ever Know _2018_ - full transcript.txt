Anything can happen. Everything is possible and likely. Time and space do not exist. On an insignificant basis of reality, the imagination spins and weaves new patterns. NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW Inside the kitchen of the S?nchez Hurtado residence, Susana's mother is almost done preparing the meal. She looks surprised at her daughter who greets her with a kiss on the cheek. What have you done to your hair? It was so beautiful! Come on, mom. I looked like a small-town girl! SOMEWHERE IN MEXICO. NOT SO LONG AGO. Mrs. Luc?a Rodr?guez de Mej?a. Known address. She's always telling me she doesn't want you near him. Mom! A letter arrived from my aunt! Susana understands her mother's words. And she can't help feeling happy. I talked to my husband about the commercial property. He thinks it's a great idea. We even saw one nearby. It's close to our place. He says that if you sell your truck and the mill, you could pay the transfer fee. In the meantime, you could live with us. Our place is small, but we'll figure it out. I'm sending you some postcards so Braulio can see the city. I hope we can visit you soon. "Say hello to everybody. Your sister who misses you, Sara." Are my cousins coming? Maybe. Oh! The break is over and you didn't have lunch. Come! I'll make you something, you can eat it on the way! Who gets off here? Be careful! Give me the chair, please. Thank you. Careful! -See you tomorrow, Sir. -Take care. Thank you. My sister says there's an available commercial property near her house. We could open an eatery, a restaurant, like they call it over there. This again? -We talked about it! -Her husband says... ...it's a great opportunity! I can't even eat a meal in peace. Look at your girlfriend! She went for a few days and came back all changed. You think you can get a haircut and hide where you're from. Mom, I'm going to school. You're still here? Hurry up or the teacher won't let you in. Wake up, you bum! Quiet! I told you to walk quietly! Morning. Morning, teacher. Hurry up, Braulio! It's late! Which is the number that if you add two equals nine? -Seven. -Seven. Two plus seven equals nine. Nine ninths make a whole. Now this one. Which is the number that if you add four equals ten? They're coming for you. You have to go! Those bastards won't stop until they make us all leave. I have to look after my parents. I'll wait for you here until you return. -Good morning. -Good morning, Luc?a. Can I have one kilo of rice, a liter of oil, and two cans of evaporated milk? I already gave all that to Braulio. -It's just that he movie started and-- -The movie! Every time he comes, please send him home right away. I can't send him anywhere because he takes forever. Thank you. When are you going to understand that TV is just a waste of time? The president of Mexico Jos? L?pez Portillo stated that we have enough oil to supply the nations that require it. Mom! Why don't you buy chopped firewood? Because it's more expensive! And I can do it myself! Besides it's not that hard. I brought you something. -You shouldn't have bothered. -Go see your grandpa. Leave them! I'm going to wash them later. Goddammit! The Governor of the State of Mexico, Carlos Hank Gonz?lez paid a visit to the president at the National Palace. He said that a thousand entities that lack public services will have them before his term ends. This confirms what the President said a few days ago "We will have to get used to prosperity." These men are doing things right. Finally, our country will rise like foam. Sara wrote me a letter. She says hi. -How is she doing? -Okay. Taking care of their children. You know, school, homework. I wish my children could go to that kind of school. We might move to Mexico City. To live there. They are finding a commercial property for us. If we do well, we could come back for you later. Why should I go there? To make people feel sorry for me? Your daughters are there. They still need you. There's no work here. They were always fighting with my dad. Why should they have stayed? What a nice job they got! Maids! There's not much you can do without an education. Whatever! We will never leave until we die. You're home already? How are your parents doing? They're okay. Pack me some clothes for tomorrow. I'm leaving early. Did you all write down your homework? If you don't bring it tomorrow, you won't be admitted to class. What's up, Braulio? D.G. BERLANGA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL MUNICIPAL COURT Braulio, you left your things upstairs. Was he rescued by his accomplices? No, of course not. Did he run away? I let him go. One more thief running free shouldn't be a big problem for this country. How many bandits have you killed? You certainly watch a lot of movies on TV. There are only petty thieves around here. You know? I've never had to use it. One day, I'm going to teach you how to use it. Just like a cowboy. Well, it's no wonder. This place is becoming like one of those in the movies. What do they call them? Ghost towns. How much could we get for the cows? Here? Nobody buys anything here. You see? That's why I say we should go somewhere else. Come here! Bring me my rifle. -I'll do it. He's leaving. -He's coming with me to the hill. -What about school? -He's not going to learn everything there. Be careful. I'm leaving. I'm going to make you a bigger lunch then. Let's go! You drive me crazy. I never thought I would fall in love like this. Every day it gets harder to hide my feelings. This is not okay. We can't. They will never let us. Susana tries to resist. But her will is as weak as a parapet on a swollen river. So, she gives in. Her pursed lips start opening against his lips. Bernardo closes his eyes and holds her body against his. Susana's happiness is so immense that she could cry. I don't care anymore. If we have to run away from everybody and everything, we will do so. You drive me crazy. Don't just stand there! Help! Little bastard! If all my kids turn out like you, what a nightmare it will be! Come on! Come on! Come on! -Don't touch! -Let her. It's okay. I didn't like any. We walked and walked. Until I saw this one. I immediately knew it was meant for me. It's pretty. Damn! You don't sound very enthusiastic! Get happy! At least your friend won't be left on the shelf! You should have heard the things they told me. And now I'll even have a fancy party! By the way, I hope you convinced Rigo to come. Why don't you tell me about your trip? Where did you go? Your song! In the middle of the night I dreamed of you I dreamed of you Holding me I dreamed of you Holding me What a sweet dream Love is You were so in love. I still remember. Both of you were. He seemed so in love too. If only good things lasted forever. It's just that-- I think one shouldn't have kids right away. So what should one do? Throw them away? My sister-in-law says that in Mexico City there are ways for not getting pregnant. Even doctors explain you all about them. Well, here I don't see how. Sometimes I imagine that things are different. That life is... How can I say? More like I would like it to be. It was very early. The six o' clock service. There was no party, no white dress or anything like that. Not even my mother was there. We could hardly get enough people to testify. Why didn't you have a party? You know your dad. Besides, back then it wasn't very common. We just left. Your grandpa got so mad! He didn't talk to me for a year. Until you were born. Where did you go? Somewhere! I don't even remember. If you're finished, go to the other room to play. Pick your plate and your brother's. We should at least go for a while. Teresa's father came in the morning to insist. Since when do you care so much about parties? We became a couple at a dance party. That's okay when you're young. Now, we would look ridiculous. Are you still up? What's going on? Shall we dance? Come. Very good. May I go to the bathroom? Yes. I'm watching you! Put away that notebook! What's up Braulio? Is your lesson finished? No. I'm on my way to the bathroom. You shouldn't play with that. Give it to me. Don't worry. I won't say a word. We're good friends. Aren't we? It's just getting used to it. It took us some time too. How do you say? Adapting. Adapting or resigning? Leave it there. I'll wash it later. Why do we accept everything just like that? Without any hesitation? Because it's easier to play by the rules. Sticking to what we know. And there we go like cows to the slaughterhouse. My mom thinks my marriage is some kind of miracle. She would tell me over and over again. "This is your last chance. No one else is going to take you." Can you believe it? Someone should warn us. Who? Our mothers? You can't learn from someone else's mistakes. Aren't you afraid of what people say about that plant? Those are just rumors from people with nothing better to do. They wish they had one. In the middle of the night I dreamed of you I dreamed of you Holding me I dreamed of you Holding me What a sweet dream Love is In the middle of the night I dreamed of you I dreamed of you Holding me I dreamed of you Holding me What a sweet dream... Lucha Villa is such a good singer, isn't she? I met her once! My son took me to a concert at the Mexico Arena. I still remember. Wake up From this seductive dream We'll drink from Our glasses full of liquor What a sweet dream Love is You're a coward! You'll join us soon. You'll see. -Do you need anything? -Gasoline for the mill. Send me a letter as soon as you can. Yes, as soon as I can. You'll see. Ready! Braulio! Goodbye! Films look better at the movie theater. -The movie theater? -Yes. Movie theaters! When I lived in the city, I went almost every Sunday. The first time I didn't like it. But it was a bad movie theater. I don't even remember where it was. They kept stopping the movie, asking us for money to keep watching it. I thought, fuck off! I won't keep paying! I won't pay a single cent. And I left! Braulio! It's late. Go home! Your mom is going to worry! -Can you watch the movies in color? -Yes. In color! At the City's movie theaters, they play American films in English! They use subtitles so we can understand. Otherwise, how could we? How are the movie theaters? They're huge! With a lot of seats. And every seat is occupied. Can you believe it? You pay just once at those theaters, but they're more expensive. They turn off the lights. Everyone is quiet. And then, a very strong light hits the white screen. And then it starts. Everything looks huge. It even seems like you're there. Inside the movie! Auntie! I'm so glad you brought her! Your wife never brings her. Come! I've got something for you! I can't stand these fucking flies! I'm going to feed you. I'm sure you haven't had lunch. You look so thin! And you work so hard! You didn't have to work today? No. Is it true what your wife's saying? That you're moving to Mexico City. -That's what she wants, but I-- -I'm sure it's because of her sisters. Or who knows, really. But why would you go? You hardly come to see me. If you move there, you won't even remember me. What are you talking about? You're the woman he's going to marry! He would never set his eyes on someone else, especially not on a maid's daughter! I saw them kissing in the garden. They live in this house but they're from a different social class. I'm going to stop this! What are you going to do? There's no doubt that Mrs. Rafaella feels she has been betrayed. She can't understand how the girl she helped so much could do that. Upon seeing her aunt so conflicted, Andrea smiles with malice. All of a sudden, Bernardo steps out of his bedroom. Andrea leaves without saying hello. Good morning, Mom. How are you doing? You're shameless! How am I doing? How can you even ask me that? This is for women! Why does it upset you? Why are you telling everybody we're moving to Mexico City? There's nothing to tell! You refuse to talk to me about it. We can't just leave! Don't you understand? I'm leaving. Rigo, wait! I cooked you something. You haven't opened the mill! Is that what you wanted it for? -I'll be back in two weeks. -Two weeks? Tell Braulio to clean the stable well. It's going to rain today. Mom. There's someone at the entrance. What's his name? Bernardo. He already told us. As soon as it stops raining, bring him some blankets to the stable. I hope you don't mind sleeping there. No, not at all. You can take care of the animals we have on the hill. -How are you doing? -Well. Your livestock is well nourished. Is it hard? If you want, I could try. Do you know how to do it? Not really. But I could try. Like you. Would you like some coffee, sir? I've been here for a while, and you still call me sir. I mean... you can call me by my name. I'm going to pour you a cup, sir. Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Ma'am... I mean don't worry. I will get you something to change into, sir. Bernardo, I'll get you something to change into. I'm sorry! You're a good observer, kid. Men who know how to observe get far in life. Come! Let's saddle the horse! They provide a great service. That's why we have to take good care of them. They are like us. Sometimes stubborn and rebellious. But from time to time, we need someone to take care of us. What is beyond those mountains? Even more mountains. And hills. And then the desert. You drive me crazy. Braulio! Let's go to the hill. Come. That's the way cowboys carry them. Put those cans on that trunk. Come on! Hurry up! Now it's your turn. You have to stare at your opponent without blinking. You have to think that only one of you will survive. And that must be you. Braulio! The horse! He almost got away, didn't he? I'm glad you stopped it. I didn't stop it. When they're afraid or when they're running away from something, no thing or person can stop them until they get what they want. Just like us. Braulio! What is that? Where did you get it from? Tomorrow, you're going to return it. Your dad is coming back soon, and you haven't cleaned this place. I don't want him to come back! Tomorrow morning, I'll help you clean. -What did you bring me? -Look! It doesn't need batteries. You came back. -Look! -We got bread. And there's no corner in The deepest part of the sea That I wouldn't find for you Every time I see the sun shine You shine with it And within the notes of any song I hear I find you wandering there Can't you see that I'm dying in this life Waiting for you? Even if you find yourself At the very edge of the world I will be by your side in a second Just close your lovely eyes And talk to me Talk to me, talk to me Every time I see the sun shine You shine with it And within the notes of any song I hear I find you wandering there Can't you see that I'm dying in this life Waiting for you? Even if you find yourself At the very edge of the world I will be by your side in a second Just close your lovely eyes And talk to me Talk to me... Get your household appliances in the new and modern San Jose Plaza... I'll be back later. I'm going to visit Berta. What's up with that? Who fixed it? I did. Who else? It's not that hard. The teacher makes an incision on the pallid skin of the cadaver. One of the students faints at the sight of the viscous entrails. Susana and her friend, with her white coats still on go out to the University yard. Finally! I thought this lesson was going to go on forever! You can't stand anything. I can't even stand the smell. Maybe I was not made for medicine. I have no vocation. Then why are you studying it? -What does having a vocation mean? -She doesn't know what to answer. -She just shrugs her shoulders. -I don't know. I think it means doing what you really like. The two friends get lost among the students that walk along the University hallways. Would you like to go to University when you grow up? -We would have to leave. -Of course! Let's wait for the story to play along, because destiny has some surprises for our main character. So you're defending these filthy people all by yourself? The law is on my side. Finally, there will be peace in this place. No one will ever know how long injustice will prevail in this town but as long as one of us is alive, we will fight for our land. Are you looking for a woman? Here I am! Nothing has changed here. This town is going nowhere. Kids, wake up! We're almost there. Where does my aunt Sara live? In Mexico City. Where's that? It's far from here. Mom! They're here. -Luc?a! -You came! Look! It's for your daughter. I hope it fits. You shouldn't have bothered. There was no need. She's going to love it. Javier is determined to convince your husband. I can see my dad is not doing well. It's so early and he's already at the tavern. It's okay. He is less annoying that way. Were you ever in love with my dad? Please. I hardly knew him when we got together. I think I had seen him two or three times before. So you tell me. I couldn't have married without being in love. We couldn't even think about that before. The only thing I wanted is to run away from my father's cruelty. He was teasing me all the time to get a husband! Get someone to support you! I'm not supporting any slackers! It wasn't that different with us. I never told you anything like that. My dad did. And you were his favorite. I was the one he pestered. Mom! Is it true that there's a gunman here who kills bandits? Braulio says so. We had to take out a loan from the bank, but the place is all ours. We don't pay rent or anything. Everybody's doing so. The commercial property negotiation is almost done. Well, nothing is without risks. But wouldn't you like to have your own place in Mexico City? And then maybe even your own car. Haven't you watched... I mean, haven't you heard on the radio? Our country is moving forward! And this is a very good time, school registrations are starting. There's not even a middle school here and they teach English over there. Look what I brought you! Braulio! Come here kid! Your parents tell me that you like school very much. Would you like to attend your cousins' school? Would you like to move to Mexico City with us? Yes, Braulio! Our school is awesome! Yes. Your brother-in-law thinks everything is easy. How are they going to take our son? Besides, you know Braulio well. He wouldn't be able to stand a week over there. He wants to go. And we're going to join him in a few months. You've been planning all this behind my back. I can see my opinion is not fucking important! What's his future here? If he's lucky, he'll be a rural teacher in a place even worse than here. How are we going to give our son away just like that? What kind of mother are you? -Let's go! -It's before dawn! Come on! Let's go! When are you going to join me? Soon, very soon. Why didn't you let me to say goodbye to my dad and sister? Obey your uncle and aunt. And keep being a good student. You'll meet a lot of people there. You have to be strong. Try not to miss us too much. I'd rather stay. Let's go! You stink. You smell like cigarettes. Be well, Dad. Take care. I know you love the bread from this town. -You shouldn't have bothered. -It's no bother. Please take him with you! But Rigo doesn't want to. He said no. Don't worry. I will take care of it. Braulio! Where's Braulio? Susana looks around. Their new place is quite different from the Sanchez Hurtado's mansion. Nothing is the way it used to be. Someone is knocking at the door now. Who could it possibly be at this hour? Susana walks to the door impatiently and opens it. Her heart beats faster when she sees who's at the door. -She is only able to whisper... -Bernardo. Who could possibly write these stories? And who could possibly believe them? Thank you for listening. Don't miss the next episode of ''I will never stop dreaming about you." Another passionate story from the acclaimed writer-- My mother would have never allowed me to waste my time with these things. Your mother didn't allow you to do many things. Are you going to help me or should I grind them myself? You know you don't have to pay. Do you have news from your son? Sara hasn't written. I can hardly believe it. How could you send him away like that with strangers? They are my family. I wasn't even able to say goodbye to him. Rigo hasn't visited me in a while, I heard the news by chance. It was a rushed decision. -We will join him later-- -Rigo has a lot of work here. And he makes good money. I can't understand why you're so ambitious. We'll see how they treat your son there. You know what they say, "Guests start to stink after three days." Would you like me to cut your hair? You would look even prettier. No. Should I turn the radio on? Not now. He had to take a test. He'll be admitted into the second grade. He'll have to repeat two grades. He didn't go to preschool so it's fine. This way he will be with kids his same age. Once, he wanted to go back, but his aunts took him to the movies, and he calmed down. Look, we couldn't get the commercial property. When we were about to get it, the rent was much higher. They say it's because prices are rising. We're looking for another one, but they're all very expensive. Things here are not going as well anymore. A lot of people are being fired at Javier's job. I'm sending you a picture of Braulio in his school uniform. There's your progress. He will lose years because of your stubbornness. I'm going to bring him back. My sister is right, he's better off here with us. Then go on and bring him back with us. To this place where he will end up like us. You won't believe it, but your dad was very happy to see you in your uniform. He even looked proud. I hope you're studying a lot. It's okay if you have to repeat two grades. I'm sure you're going to make it to college. We're doing everything we can to be with you soon. Your daughter is all grown up. Is she starting school soon? I'll be going to school in Mexico City! Right, mom? WE ARE ALL PART OF THE SOLUTION When I listen to the radio show, I think a lot about you. Susana is about to become a doctor. Bernardo did marry that other girl. But I think he's going to leave her sooner or later. Say hi to your uncle and aunt. Your mom, who misses you and loves you, Luc?a Rodr?guez de Mej?a. I'm sure you killed it so you could feed it to my dad's friends. It should be just for the two of you. You've been doing this ever since I was a child. What's wrong? When did you become so picky? Are you pregnant? Have you told your husband? I don't want to tell him. I don't want to have this baby. Children are born and that's that. You don't think about whether you want them or not. Seven of Europe's most important countries announced that they will import less oil. PEMEX's manager said Mexico has nothing to worry about that our country is ready to face any financial contingency. What's the deal, Rigo? When are you going to let me drive? You're dying to steal my job, aren't you? No, not at all. I just want to learn. So I can go to Mexico City and work as a taxi driver. Not you too. Luc?a! -Where's your mom? -In the bedroom. I didn't think you were coming. I had to run another errand. That's why I'm late again. Are you going on a trip? There's the key. You know how to do it. It's still hard for me. Just turn it on and I'll do the rest. Luc?a! You're imagining things. She would have never abandoned her children. She already let one go. Tomorrow I'm talking to the schoolteacher to see if he'll take your son back. Manuel couldn't make it? I haven't seen him in months. So it's true what they say. That plant brings bad luck. It spreads darkness. It was your fault, you wretch! Calm down, Sir. Don't talk bullshit. What's going on? Mom. I'm so sorry. Where are your sisters? They couldn't make it. Their bosses didn't give them permission. She was the only one who was worth anything. Braulio, greet your dad. Hail, Mary, full of grace the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God pray for us sinners now. And at the hour of our death. Amen. Hail, Mary, full of grace the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God pray for us sinners now. Don't let him see her that way. Hail, Mary, full of grace the Lord is with thee. Susana, determined, opens the door to her office. Bernardo sits inside waiting for her. She's not surprised. She shuts the door calmly behind her. -Turn that off. -I told you on the phone I was busy. I'm telling you to turn it off! I'm going to the operating room, today is not possible. I'm desperate, Susana. My life is hell! I'm getting divorced. Do you remember when I begged you not to get married? I wasn't able to stop loving you, to stop dreaming about you. You have to give me another chance. Susana opens the door with confidence. I'm sorry, but I have to go. Bernardo stands up and starts walking. He stops in front of her. He looks at her. Having him so close to her makes her feel weak. Her convictions seem meaningless now. Dad. I'm leaving. In case you need it.
