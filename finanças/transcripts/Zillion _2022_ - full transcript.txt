If you're stupid, then you can easily hide that. People can't tell by looking at your face. Well, not with most people then. But if you're small, like me, you can tell right away. So what could I do? I had to make sure that people could no longer look past me. He is our god. Frank is our god. Does it also have to do with being infamous, extravagant... a bit of the talk of the town? "Say, the Zillion..." The flamboyant and controversial club owner... Zillion boss Frank Verstraeten remains in custody. His mother was also questioned. Who is Frank Verstraeten? If you read the press, he's a gangster and a mafia figure. At 27 years old, I was the king of the nightlife. I had so much money that I couldn't spend it in this lifetime... and everyone knew my name. Frank Verstraeten, the little one from Meise... was the largest for a while. To really understand the whole Zillion story, we have to go back to the beginning. When I was still Frankske from Meise. A brat who had never set foot in a discotheque... and who was going to the conquer the world with his computers. What are those? - Trains. Yes, those are the train tracks. You have to envision the trains yourself. Those were the most advanced microchips you could find at the time. Imported directly from China. Everyone wanted it. And I had it. Yes, that looks like train tracks, yes. For morons then. You could call it smuggling, but mama had a much better word for it. Frankske. - Mom. 'Jackpot.' If you want to know who I am, you have to know who Marleen Verstraeten is. Don't you see anything about me? Oh, sorry, you got a new haircut, of course. Skin cancer, throat cancer, bladder cancer and breast cancer. Marleen Verstraeten had survived them all. Mama was a tough one, unbreakable. I got that from her. I was going to start my business, here in Meise. Web designers, graphic designers, even the butcher around the corner... everyone had to know who Frank Verstraeten was, what he sold... and especially under what conditions. Very important: invoice, import tax, VAT, all that nonsense, we don't participate in that. Like it or not. Thank you. - But isn't that illegal? Frank's dad used to say life's too short to pay taxes. Precisely. What I'm calling for... I have here... Patience, I never had that. And certainly not at that time. Computer chips and... Are you selling technology or are you calling to say he has AIDS? Yes, am I speaking with Clear Design Ruddervoorde? I have very good news for you. But also bad news. It couldn't go fast enough for me. I just saw things bigger. Whether it is software or hardware... our professionals are available day and night. By showing my face on TV, my company was immediately on the map. I could barely keep up with the orders. And because it was difficult for me to fly to China every week... I made China come to Meise. I really need those two. How are those things? This one was done, wasn't it? - Yes. Good day, sir. Please. INFOBrix became a household name. Open 24/7, door-to-door service and lifetime warranty. At the age of 24 I was the employer of 32 technicians... and I earned a million Belgian francs a week. In black of course. VIC 2000, MS-DOS or preferably Turbo Pascal... at INFOBrix we understand every language. But what I didn't know at the time was that my story had yet to begin. Cut, cut, cut. Stop. - What? Nadine, open up. How many times do I have to repeat it? Dennis, I'm open right? - I'm not talking about your cunt... but about your position. You cover everything. I don't see shit. And if I don't see anything, then the jerks at home don't see shit either. Claudio, come here. That pussy light a little bit closer to that cunt. No, not too close. I still have burns from last time. You can't see those blisters on the screen. Roeland, that microphone. You keep shadowing those tits. Hold it higher. It wasn't me. - Who else was it, idiot? What is with you guys today? I'm the boss here. Concentration. One, two, three... Dennis... - Ronny, hold on. It's not your turn yet. But that guy from those computers is here. - Then say so immediately. Ah brother, I thought you weren't coming. They say to Dennis, 'You have to go digital. Digital is the future.' But Dennis doesn't like digital. Dennis likes videos. Hoho, let me see. Stop, stop, stop. He wobbles a little. I would make it a little stiffer, otherwise it's not right. Dennis listen, and now you have to see what happened. Here, first half hour of Cover Story poof, up in smoke. Do you know what that means? That people can't follow along? - The man has humor. Your hard drives aren't compatible. Where did you buy that junk? Your CRT screens look shit as well. They just overheat your housing, so you better switch to LCD. They also consume less power, by the way. The question is: Can you help me, brother? With his 40,000 video films sold... Dennis Black Magic was the undisputed porn king of Belgium. And according to legend, born with a boner. Bravo. Hero of the day. Nadine, give that man a blowjob. Say, I'm not a whore, huh. - I'll film it, then you're an actress. Thanks, Frank. Who should I contact for my payment? - Payment... Listen. What would you think, instead of money, huh... VIP tickets for the Carré. That's what people fight for, trust me. What is that? - You don't know what the Carré is? That's the place to be, friend. Everyone's there. Anyone who matters is there. The prettiest chicks, the hottest bimbos. You have to see it for yourself to believe it. If there's anything like heaven, it's right there. Glamour, glitter, it's all there for the taking. If you would have told me that this fat guy with his blue glasses, was going to change my life... I would have never believed you. But yes, how do things go sometimes? Via a detour. Those are VIP tickets. Sorry but it will be very busy, so only regulars tonight. Ladies. What exactly is the problem? Fuck off, little one. What did you call me? And now to your mother. Losers. - Franky, everything okay? Hello, sir. Can I help you with anything? Are you his mother? - Yes. He's a smart one, isn't he. Did he get that from you? That would be too much honor. No, no, no. And you are? Nico Tackaert, Special Tax Inspectorate. Thank you, Madam. Is everything alright? Yes, I have a bit of eczema. - I mean, with his accounting. Yes, Mom, that's standard procedure. Ordinary routine check for starters. - It will show. It's not easy as a small self-employed person, Mr. Tackaert. And he works so hard. I always tell him to rest. But yeah, he doesn't want to listen. Sympathetic mother. - Yes. We're not done yet, are we? You can ask questions to my sympathetic mother. I have a question for you. Where's your real accounting? Where do you write down what we aren't allowed to know, but what you yourself shouldn't forget? I don't know what you're talking about. What? The BBI doesn't come to Meise for nothing, Frank. You stand out too much. He didn't find anything, did he? - Do you know what you earned this month? Yeah right. 6,325,700... - All black. And what do we do with that? We can use it to light the stove next winter. Those guys aren't stupid. Just make sure you stay ahead of them. Mom was right. As always. Having too little money is a problem, everyone knows that. But what no one realizes is that having too much money is also a problem. A problem I had to solve quickly... or that scabhead from taxes would show up at my door more often. The trick is to work with obscure companies from Moldova, Uzbekistan... from all those monkey countries, far from the eye of the Belgian tax authorities. Yes? We can switch to foreign currencies. That makes it even more difficult to trace. Important for you to know... - Missy, that ice cream, that's una bomba. It's better than sex, really. What's your secret? - Sorry, but that stays in the family. It's very simple, then you can marry me. Are you not interested? - Sorry, Frank, sorry. How does Dennis get his money? The 16th of every month, Mom comes to your place, delivering ice cream. This way you can release and sell your masterpieces in large quantities. This is how you make black money white. You understand? And then, not unimportantly, I will send you invoices from INFOBrix... for services I never provide. But that's how I get my money back... minus your commission of, say, ten percent. Listen, Frank, I'm going to be very honest with you. Chemistry has never been my strong suit. Numbers, algebra... Makes me go limp. Well, it doesn't matter. What do you expect from Dennis? Making movies. The more the better. I'll take care of the budget. Like a producer. Yes, if you want to call it that, yes, producer. One more thing Dennis. You have to promise me one thing. The day you make your first million... A million? - ... then you take me with you. Where to, Frank? - To the Carré. I'll show you the basement if I have to, brother. Definitely, deal. From the moment Dennis and I found each other... our business ran like a train. And the winner is... Dennis Black Magic. In less than half a year he made 27 porn films... giving me back all my pennies whiter than Michael Jackson. I remember telling my mother about my dream. She was shocked. "But, Dennis, you're not going to make porn, are you?" I said, 'No mom, I'm not going to make porn. I'm going to make porn beautiful. And that's something completely different.' Thank you. You couldn't tell by looking at my face... but believe me, deep down I was there enjoying it too. And I'll let you in on another secret. Porn is an illusion. Frank, come on in. Take a picture. That special feeling you get when all your plans come together nicely. I always say one thing: It shouldn't just be suggestively naked... the nude in itself should also be suggestive. That's the whole thing. That doesn't mean much to me. It would only be fair if everyone made the same porn movie. Do you understand? I'm making a movie right now... where you're the perfect girl for it. - What is that? What is that? - Mitsubishi. Ecstasy. Makes you big. - Figure of speech, brother. That's bitter. - That fucking asshole bit on it. He bit on it. - I just said that? Give that bottle. - Come and get it. Give that bottle. Give that bottle. Dennis is a man of honor, keeps his promises. good evening Franks. Franky, Franky, huh. Gino, I have some people with me. That's no problem Dennis. You are popular here. They see the porn king and think about the last time they came. Yes, Pavlov. - What? Pavlov. - He might come later. People are talking, there is backbiting. - Dennis, do you remember me? Do I remember you? You are the prettiest girl around here. Those PARs are behind. What? Those PARs, those tin boxes your grandma used to slow-dance under... they are not in sync with the beat. You see? You're a weirdo, Frank. Did you know? What's the pill saying? I don't feel anything. Calm down, Frank. I don't like it anymore. What are you doing, idiot? What are you doing? Dennis. - The grasshopper. Did you hurt yourself? Who is that? You need to get out more often, fratello. That's the new Miss Belgium. Vanessa Goossens, officially the hottest woman in the country. Miss Glamour, Miss Wellness, Miss Strawberry, Miss Diamond. All she had to do was register and she'd already won. Vanessa was like me. Someone with ambitions, someone with a dream. Honey, come on, it's time. Come on, come on. And her father would do anything for that. Vanessa. Mr Goossens. I saw that immediately. I the software, she the hardware. We, we were made for each other. And I had to let her know that as soon as possible. I'm willing to pay a lot of money to have you exclusively in the Carré. My own prison on the A12. - Listen to his proposal. All those girls here would like to be in your shoes. Yes? Until they have to put on my five-inch stilettos. Boss, that guy over there insists on talking to Vanessa. Do you know that guy? No. What is it? - I just want to say something, okay? Tell me, I'll tell her. Who are you? Boy, this is my club. Your club? That cafe with the lamps, you mean? I have bad news for you, but also good news. The bad news: You're basically already bankrupt. But we can do something about it. - I can get things done here in a week... - Go away, little one. What do you call me? Ouch, boy. He bites. - What do you call me? Franky? Everything fine? Franky? Are you out of your mind? Open the door. Frank Verstraeten. You're not setting foot in here ever again, understand? Is that funny or what? - Remember that name. Yes. Okay. Are you okay? Sit still, sit still. Do you need another aspirin later? You'll sleep better. Yes? By throwing me out they wanted to teach me a lesson. And they taught me a lesson. But not necessarily what they had in mind. There you go, triple A location. In other words: the center of the city, sufficient surface area and close to the access roads. And that's for sale? - Today it still is. Tomorrow it won't be. What do you want to say, brother? That I buy everything here. Is that a joke? That's what I asked, but I don't see him smiling. Excuse me, Frank, but what do you know about discotheques? Enough to know I want one myself. One that blows the Carré back to the Stone Age, where it belongs. Frank, with all due respect, that's beyond your hats. There's more to it than just spinning some records. Trust me, it's a hard world. You have to get the right people in and keep the wrong ones out. He needs you for that. - Me? You didn't think I was going to do all that alone, did you? I take care of the furniture and you take care of the invites. All the beautiful people, the hottest women, invite them already. Your own VIP room. What do you think of that? So the porn king and the disco king? Let's do it. Do you already have a name? No no. That's the only thing I don't have yet, no. What did you think about... The Gloryhole? I'll think about it. I say go for it. Buy it. Your father would have been proud, you know that? His son, an entrepreneur. Just like him. And me too. I am also very proud. Frank, what's that? - What is this? Goddamnit. poop. what is this now? Good evening. Yes, Frank... that doesn't look good, does it? How's your eczema, Nico? It's funny you ask. I recently went to the dermatologist. And you know how that goes, waiting... And then you start reading books that you normally never read. And then, suddenly I see Frank Verstraeten, the small business owner from Meise... in the picture drinking champagne with the greatest of the earth. Is that punishable? No. But I took the liberty of taking a closer look. We have raided Mr. Dennis Burkas... and we have all of his accounting records in our possession. Or rather, the lack of it. Never heard of him. - No? Better known as Dennis 'Black Magic'? So you want to tell us that this crap cost eight million francs? Watch what you say, huh. Dennis has won a lot of prizes with The Monaco Affair. You don't understand, Burkas. We know where that money came from and you know it too. I think you don't understand me. Dennis is a man of honor who does not betray his friends. Point. Look, Dennis, you write his name down or you go to jail. Choose. - And the problem is, Frank... we found a lot of incriminating invoices from Black Magic... that lead directly to INFOBrix. Invoices that you must declare. I must not to do anything. INFOBrix isn't even mine. F. Verstraeten, who is that? Yes... - Wrong. Ferdinand Verstraeten, my grandfather. 98 years old and respected CEO of INFOBrix. That moron couldn't wipe his own ass anymore... but unbeknownst to him, he was the one and only boss of INFOBrix. You didn't do your homework, did you Nico. Then prepare your grandfather for bankruptcy. I told you? I am a man of honor. Tackaert. - Yes, with me. He doesn't want to say anything. You can go. Who made that? - What? That painting. Your son? I made that. Art. - Pastime. I'd like to buy that from you. For my living room. What would that cost? - It's not for sale. Everything is for sale. Shut up, little one. Yes, that's what we call you here at the station. Meise's little one. Enjoy your weekend. INFOBrix was convicted and declared bankrupt. All movable and immovable property was worth nothing anymore... and my accounts frozen. That scabhead had taken everything from me. But none of that was anything compared to what they had done to Dennis. One year unconditional because he wouldn't say my name. If I ever had anything like a friend, it was him. For most people, prison would be torture... but for Dennis a way to make new friends. Do you know what I said? I swear on my mom. "Ask your wife for the address, I've fucked her there often enough." I've fucked her enough times. good guy Frank, do you have a moment? I'm busy. When I call you, you come. Come on. You take the other two. While you were playing the big man with your porn friend... did your mother put some of your money aside? What would you do without me? 1997 was the year... that Microsoft bought Apple shares for $150 million... the year the first Pentium II chip came off the production line... that the world found its way to Mars and two guys had a great idea. But make no mistake, 1997 was especially the year... of the Zillion. One needn't worry. The city council has made clear agreements with Mr Verstraeten. The permit only applies to a multifunctional space... with a focus on sports and culture. No one would be so crazy as to give me a permit... for a mega disco right in the city center. That would be political suicide. - Multifunctional. So I solved it creatively as always. Mayor Vanacker is right. The Zillion will be a nice gift for the neighborhood. That was the good thing about the 90s. You could fool people back then. You don't have to try that nowadays. Once I had my permits, the rest was child's play. I took out an interest-free loan with the largest brewery in the country... and the train had left. I had steel imported from Russia, robotics from Finland... and the rest I could find in China. The Zillion became a technological total concept... a life-size computer. Everything digital and synchronized. A look at the future. Nothing like this had ever been built. I want you to work with servo. Computer controlled. Panels that can move independently of each other, unmanned. Twelve in diameter. You see? Even if you could, you wouldn't get that fixed to the ceiling in 1,000 years. You didn't hear me say anything about a ceiling, did you? Four trusses, locally and visibly anchored. We make them part of the show. After less than half a year I had everything ready. As agreed, I took care of the furniture and Dennis took care of the invites. Thanks to his customer base, the entire jet set was invited to my opening. Anyone with name and fame, anyone who had ever had their head on TV... he knew them all. It will be magical, really. You have to be there. Sorry, Dennis unfortunately can't be there that evening. I have compulsory leave. Great that you're coming. I'm going to hang up, someone else has to call. Bye, pop. On October 16, 1997, the time had finally come. The Zillion opened. A guest list of 5000 people, but honestly? Only one person had to be there for me. And I had booked her, just to be sure. Vanessa. Photo please. - Vanessa, here. Hey, Vanessa. Look here. Full concentration, everyone. Check. - Yes, we are ready. Pyrotechniek stand-by. - Pyrotechniek stand-by. We switch to Zillion time. - Zillion time, check. Ten, nine, eight, seven... six, five, four... three, two, one... Who comes up with such a thing? Frank Verstraeten. Vanessa. - Goossens. I know that. Everyone here knows that. Where do you want me? - What? Normally we get a VIP stage, for autographs and photos and stuff. Herman. We spoke on the phone. Correct. The manager. - First of all, her father. Yes, Yes. Nothing is necessary. Just have fun, that's all. OK, fine. Here he is, the big man. Congratulations, good job. Did I invite you? I specifically closed the Carré, so as not to ruin your evening. Get used to it. Wesley? Wesley. Will you make sure that sir is paid? And do double. For the effort. - Very good. I don't want to have to come looking for you, do I? - No, Dad. What are we drinking? A coupe? - Yes here. Never mind, boy. Uncle Dimi's treat. Are you coming? - I'll wait here. How about a guided tour? By you? - Yes. By whom else? My father doesn't let me go with strange men. Didn't I just introduce myself? What's the worst that could happen? Can I have a bottle? - Do you know tonight's promotion? When you hand in your membership of the Carré, you get a free bottle. Excuse me? - Here, mine. Six rooms, six different concepts... an amusement park on beats with a new theme every weekend. The Zillion is much more than just a nightclub, it's a way of life. Most people just come here to find a sweetheart, you know. Is that why you go to discotheques? - I come because they pay me. Those bracelets let me know what they're drinking, when they're drinking... I even know their body temperature. Those parameters all come in here. I know you're thirsty before you even realize it. That's not just allowed? - What do you mean? Yes, privacy or something? - Customer service. Thank you Madam. Thank you. What is it? My father will go crazy if he doesn't find me, you don't want to see that. I'll handle that. Frank for Wesley. - Yes, chef. Wesley, keep that man busy for a while. Good? - What do you mean? Yes, make something up. - Okay. So, that's settled. Come on. Sir? Let me show you backstage. I don't have time for that, boy. Hey, but no... Hey, say. Goddamnit. Hey. So you own a discotheque and you don't dance? There are way too many people here. - Come on, don't be silly. Like this. Like this? - Yes like that. Calm down, boy, I'm coming down now. Excuse me. It all looks the same here, man. Say it if you hear me. Herman. - Here. Here. Where's Vanessa? - Upstairs, huh. Damn it. Vanessa. Come along, come. Dad, I'm dancing. - Come along. Thank you for booking. come. Sorry, dudes. Full is full. Full, what do you mean full? - You're just a racist. Now we're gonna get it. Sir, we just want to party. You understand that, don't you? What do we do with this, chief? Sir, why can't we go in? - Wrong shoes. Yes? Hé, fuck you. Hey. Say, where should I put that card? - You just have to scan, mom. Yes well done. many incidents and there is great concern among local residents. We spoke to mayor Kris Vanacker for a response. The relationship of trust between Verstraeten and the city council is extremely good. So I'm sure we won't break each other's trust. Verstraeten himself speaks of a huge success. How did you find me? - That is not important. The question is: Where are we going? Come on, get in. What now? I have a surprise. That's not possible, is it? I can't just leave here, can I? Why not? Just do what you feel like. I never listened to anyone and look at me now. I'm talking to the most beautiful woman in Belgium. Vanessa, can we? - Okay. Is this your idea of ​​a romantic date? So it's a date? - No, I didn't say that. Oh my gosh. I hate you, I hate you, I hate you. Are you doing it with Dimi? - What? Well, like I asked. No, he's not my type, if you must know. And I? am i your type? Oh my God. Hold me. Again. - No, not again. Are you coming to the Zillion this weekend? No, that won't work. And the weekend after that? I now work exclusively for the Carré. What? Dad thought that was a good idea... I don't care what your father thinks. What do you think? You and me. That's the future. If you were with me, you can do whatever you want... when you want, how you want, doesn't matter. Party every day. I'm not really sure what to think of you. Why? What am I doing wrong? - No nothing. Just. What then? - No, no, it... I just don't know anyone like you. Yes, I hear that often. You are so insecure and sure at the same time. But... But I still think you're cute. Really? Vanessa. Will you come in for a minute? come. Hurry up. - Yes. Eight or twelve? Eight... What? - Your motorcycle. Eight or twelve cylinders? I don't know. I liked that color, so I thought... Herman, listen. First of all I want to apologize... for what happened last time. If I'd known that Wesley was such an inept... No problem, dude. Was a misunderstanding. - Yes, exactly. You like my daughter, don't you. That's OK. You can say that. - Yes? If it wasn't my daughter, I would know too. Nice ass, eh. Beautiful breasts. Not too big, not too small. Just perfect. But the thing is: It is my daughter... so I make sure she doesn't end up in the paws of dudes like you. Herman... - Do you understand? Yeah, I just want... - Or I don't dick your balls, huh man. Huh? Like this? - Yes, Herman. Yes yes, I understand. Okay. I hope I never have to see your face again. Herman Goossens had no intention of handing over his daughter just like that. Never again, eh. And I wasn't about to give her up just like that. Because if I wanted something in life, only one thing mattered: Hold on until I got it. Fratello. Did you miss me? Did you miss me, that is the question. Every day, boy. Hey, bro. Hey? come on Zillion Gold Card. This allows you to go in and out anywhere, no matter when. Parking in front of the door, unlimited drinks. Are you serious, Frank? - In the toilet they even come and wipe your ass. And that is not all. You will be my PR manager. All media, promotional campaigns, magazines... You won't know where to start. I will not disappoint you, brother. Sorry, that's a little too fast, doll. You need to take that slower. And don't forget the shaft, that's half the magic. Welcome home, eh. Partner. One more thing. I'm having a problem. Something you will have to solve. 88 hp here. Everyone saw that Vanessa's dad was a horny goat. So me and Black Magic made good use of that. You'll be shocked. That car just shoots... In return, Dennis wanted me to get his Albanian friends from jail a job. What kind of experience do these guys have? - Experience, what do you mean? Yes, have they already been at the door somewhere else? They survived two wars. Keeping out a few drunks and Moroccans will also work. I am satisfied with Chico and his team. Why should I change that? Frank, don't change, complete. Boss, let me prove myself. I'm the boss here. It's okay, Dennis. You get your way. Put those Albanians at the door. Their whole family for all I care. Thanks, Frank, you won't regret this. Trust me. If you can crack skulls, you're still a good doorman, aren't you. You just have to teach them the rest, right? And, doll, everything worked out? - I need a shower. Be careful. Don't worry ma'am, she's in good hands. Vanessa. Have fun, enjoy. Frank? Be honest with me for a second. - What? What have you done to my father? - Nothing. Yes. Why is he suddenly so positive about you? And why did he cancel that deal with the Carré? You have to ask him that. I don't know that? No. Say first. - What? What you did to him. - Just, had a good chat. Chattered? - Yes. I'm not stupid, am I? You don't want to know. Trust me, you'll get mad. Yes, I do want to know. Yes? - Yeah. Okay. Stand up. I've never done this. Did you do that? Yes. Sorry. For me? Yes. You want to crawl into bed with that horrible sound next to you. You are prevented from sleeping four days a week. The neighborhood has bundled the complaints regarding nightclub Zillion... and expects a response from the mayor. Can you come back later? Can you come back this afternoon to clean? It's already noon, isn't it? In an hour or so? Frank is still asleep and I'm afraid you'll wake him up. Or do you need to clean somewhere else? No no, it's okay. I'll come back later. Thanks. The Zillion was in no time big business. From all over Europe they came to spend their money with me. Guilders, marks, pesetas, lira... They all ended up in my pocket. In a nightclub you can earn money in many ways. Above the line... and especially below the line. And those friends of Dennis understood that well. They provided coke from Colombia, speed from Holland, ecstasy from the Kempen... and whores from Poland and Moldova. As long as they respected my commission, it didn't matter to me. On the contrary. Hey, my brother. Come on in. Nadja. Those men drink for free, hé. Dennis felt like a fish in water in his own VIP room. A kingdom for the porn king. That is all right. baby. The Zillion a nice gift for the neighborhood? There were those who thought otherwise. But mayor Vanacker was powerless. My contract with the city was watertight. A multifunctional space, that is simply a multifunctional concept. In time, the Zillion turned gross national product... of a small African country. All my legal income went out the front door. And all black revenue through the back door. But as Mama had told me well: You can't do anything with black money. I created a web of shadow constructions that created a tax maze. My money was constantly traveling around the world. And when it came back home, I could spend it on fun things. But believe it or not, money has never interested me. It was the effect that I found interesting. My life then, that was something to be jealous of. I'm not going to lie about that. Everyone knew my name. Thanks to Vanessa, a whole new world opened up. Cool huh? - I like it. Do you have anything like that? - I will look. baby. I have something else for you. Shoes? - Not just any shoes. Buffalo's. I was finally where I wanted to be. Little van Meise had grown up. Damn. Don't record, eh. Mom, not now. What? Burnt where? And have you already called a doctor or an ambulance? come. - Immediately? Yes. And hurry up, huh. - Wait, I'm coming. Mama? Mom, are you okay? What are you wearing, boy? This is fashion. Because she says so. Say. She has a name, doesn't she? You're exactly Papa Chico. Didn't you get burned? - Yes. How did you do that? - Just, at the stove. Did you call the doctor? No, I put Flammazine on it. It is well. Supposedly unsinkable ship that was also made into a film. What is the Titanic? Marianne. - What is the Titanic? That is good. Good... Then rest. Hey? Ah yes, Frank... You shouldn't count on me in the Zillion anymore for a while, ok. Yes Yes. Sure. - Unless you need me. I can do without you. Until you're better, huh. Those shoes... What? - Did she buy those for you too? Yes why? Does she think you're not big enough? Take care of yourself. Hey? DJ Deca in the house. Here we go. Can we request a song? - I don't do requests, you know that right? But it's Nathalie's birthday. - It's my birthday. Please? Fine, it's okay. But you'll have to compensate me. What? You'll give me your number. Goddamnit. Shit. Razzia. No, this isn't a drill, idiot. I repeat: not a drill. Backwards. Backwards. Dirty cops. We take the main room, you take the VIP. Go, go, go. Fuck. By order of the mayor, we have the right to enter the premises. Don't confront us. That's the final warning. Hallo? It's not over yet, is it? All listen carefully, eh. Only one person decides whether the party ends here or not... and that's me. Come on. This is Zillion life. Come on. baby? What was all that? - Nothing bad. Where were you? Just downstairs. You know I'm crazy about you, don't you? Me too about you. Just tackle that asshole. Smash his head. Asshole. - No, stop. stop, stop. Stop. Four million DJs in the world and Vanessa had to choose just this one. DJ Deca was Frederik De Caluwé, grandson of Diederik De Caluwé... former Minister of Justice, current Minister of State. That had to happen to me again. You really think I'm stupid and naive. I know you have something to do with it. Why did you give your number to that guy? See, I knew it. Are you watching me? Yes, apparently that is necessary, isn't it? - That was Nathalie's number. What? That... How could I know? - You could have asked. Okay. Sorry. - Just leave me alone. Vanessa? Leave me. - Come on, Vanessa. Vanessa, open the door, come. Vanessa. - Privacy, do you actually know that word? Vanessa, open the goddamn door. I decide for myself what I do. Okay? OK, yes. I said sorry, didn't I? Those Albanians had done no half work. They had beaten that justice boy so hard... that he didn't remember a thing about it. The only thing he did remember was that he had been in the Zillion. Multiple infringements detected due to… The city, I could handle it. But the state, that became a different story. From now on I had to explain every fart in the Zillion. I had a permit for 3999 men. So what did they do? Count my customers every night. My emergency exits? Suddenly not big enough anymore. And my doormen were suddenly no longer allowed to have a criminal record. Marius, it's the law. Fuck the law. The door of the Zillion is mine. I understand that, but what can Dennis do? - Be creative. Give me the key. It's still cold. - Daddy's working on it, honey. Patience. Can't you just call a plumber? - Get out of here. Now. Now. Listen, Dennis, I promised my family never to go to war again... but if I don't get my job back, I'll make an exception. Understood? - Yes. Give me the hammer. Even a blind person could see that there would be problems with that. But I had other concerns at the time. Here, Frank. Sign that. Here. Better than my signature. My DNA. Just sign up. I had no time for anything else, let alone the important things. Because it just kept coming, one fine after the other. It was pure bullying. But I had been bullied enough in my life to know how to handle it. Bullying back. Zillion presents: every Sunday. -Zundays at Zillion. It's very simple, the show must go on. Soon you will be sitting next to him, that will be nice. I'm not gay. - Tonight you are. How hard is it to find a professional dwarf? And put on that hat. The Zundays were promoted as provocative evenings with an erotic edge. In fact? Pure porn. Black Magic was given carte blanche, with all its consequences. Gay trains, pisssex, threesomes, gangbangs, Brazilian fucking... it couldn't be crazy enough. As long as it shocked. And Vanessa? She happily participated. But what did I really care about? The Zundays were masked and anonymous. Lawyers, politicians, magistrates... The same men who blackmailed me during the day... were fucking in my Zillion at night. Listen, you can also put them at the door again, then we will get rid of all that nagging. Have you gone crazy? You don't think those thugs are still coming in here, do you? I am not the employment agency. Besides, it's your fault, dumbass. - Whoa, Frank. If you hadn't brought those vermin... It's okay, Dennis will sort it out before it gets out of hand. I understand that all your powers are transferred to the federal ones. So in concrete terms... I know what that means: search warrants, wiretaps... and my own detectives. And a hefty salary. Say, you're not in doubt, are you? I wanted that job four years ago. And then I wasn't good enough. You should ask Magistrate Van Hecke that. All I can say... Put your ego aside, Tackaert. You got the job now, that's all that matters. When do I start? No, Marius, please. Marius, please. The good news: You have one more hand to play with your dick. The bad news: Next time I'll put your dick in there. Do you understand, Dennis? Solve it. Who Ordered Hawaii? - Yes that was me. Of those things that I'm responsible for, but of which I have to say... Prosciutto. - Yes, it's mine. Damn, they forgot the spicy sauce. I always have to say to that judge: 'Possibly, I wasn't there. I only heard what happened from others.' Fifteen times this month alone I have to... Hey, honey. - Hey. Wait, let's make everything clear, because I can't see the wood for the trees anymore. Those construction and things... and the environment, that was with you, wasn't it? Say, can you turn it down a bit? We're busy here, hé. Just hold on. Here. I already ate. When? What does that matter? Are you actually eating enough? I'll put it here, you decide what you do with it. How was your shoot? Wasn't it good? Maybe with a little more smile? Honey, there's blood under your nose. Here, wipe. That might be some lipstick or something. Is something wrong? Vanessa, aren't you exaggerating a bit? Yes, Dad. Come on, let me. There you go, a little powdered. Crazy bitch. Act normal. Where were we? We're not going to turn it into nightwork, are we? No no no. I'm not moving at all. That Zillion looks good here and it stays here. Any more brilliant ideas or is that it? Do I really have to do everything alone here? Please. God damn it, Vanessa. What are you doing? I changed my mind. I do want a slice of pizza. Hello. Miss. Say, if we want to see a skeleton, we'll go to the cemetery. And I'm not paying you 15,000 balls to drool over my bitch. Okay? Men... So that short-term receivable was waived by the brewery on January 8... and it just so happens that tangible assets are sold on January 12... for bottom prices, free of tax. Can I find that strange? You can, Nico. - But you don't know anything about that? I don't work there anymore. You'd better ask Frank's bookkeepers. I'll see them tomorrow. But those documents are still signed by you. I do not know that anymore. Your dude... He hanged himself, didn't he? A lawsuit was also pending against him. Tax Fraud. That was dismissed. Due to lack of evidence. Isn't that in your file? It can't have been easy for you. Saving a business whilst raising your son. It worked anyway. We could argue that. If there's anything else... Then I will definitely call you, Nico. Say, that Vanessa Goossens, what is she really like? What does she have to do with this? - That's a really pretty girl. Now if I may say something positive about your son, he has good taste in women. And if I may believe the books, the woman of his life. That Tackaert is not tracking. You know that too, don't you? Is it funny? Do you think it's funny? We'll see if you're still smiling when they put you in jail. And that whore won't come to see you. - Stop that. With what? Hey? - Stop. With what? I just want you... - No, stop it. Stop it, yes? I know what you want. I don't want to hear it. I love Vanessa. There's nothing you can say that's going to change that. Yes? Sometimes I just think Frank hates me. Vanny, why do you think that? - Yes, I just do. You can't imagine how he treats me and what he says to me. Calm. I know that boy inside and out. He can drive you crazy sometimes, you know that too, but he really loves you. Me too, that's my problem. Really, sometimes I just wish he was a little less... That Frank was a little less Frank? - See, at least you understand me. You don't become the porn king if you don't understand the women. What do you think, Vanny? Have another try? Yes. Dennis? Do you think I'm a skeleton? Not at all. You are A+ material, top of the bill. What's the problem then? Does Frank know about this? Do you have to ask permission? Dennis doesn't have to do anything. This is of course not possible without the man it's all about: Frank Verstraeten. All understanding for sir's point of view, but my hands are also tied by the law. A catering business on an industrial estate is simply not allowed. This little guy has an explanation for everything. We have tried to contact you more than a dozen times, sir. Ma'am, I also have an agenda. If you would let me finish. I won't deny that this business comes with certain things... which sometimes take place on the margins of the law. I invest in keeping the parking lot clean myself. And everything that happens inside is, of course, my responsibility. And our right to a little night's sleep? And our right to party? Of course that doesn't matter. Boy, that Zillion is a neighborhood cancer. Thank you. You heard it, Mr. Verstraeten, the Zillion is compared to cancer. I take that as a compliment. Because no matter how hard you try, cancer cannot be eradicated. The Zillion will be a franchise and then I'll go public with it. I have plans so big they won't even fit in your head. From the moment you have a little bit of success in this country... they are ready to saw away the legs under your chair. Yes, I have money, I'm famous and I wake up every day... next to the most beautiful woman in Belgium. That makes people jealous, doesn't it? They used to do nothing but laugh at me all my life. I had to do everything alone. Tell me one thing: Who's laughing now? Frank, with all these problems, isn't this a battle you can never win? Ask me that again. - Isn't this a battle lost in advance? I can only say one thing to that. I'm a sore loser. Not your thing? You didn't think it was necessary to ask first? Honey, I really don't see the problem. Look what a nice coat I bought. - Was that your idea? Or from the fat fuck? That was my idea. That was my idea and those are my tits. Okay? I've long wondered what would happen if I did this. That is mine. Give that back. - Come here. Grab it. How did you know where that was? That is mine. You can't touch it. Listen Vanessa, I want you to stop. Yes? You'll destroy yourself. How did you know where that was? I know everything. Vanny? Goddamnit. Goddamnit. What? Frank, you need to know this. Your girlfriend came in here an hour ago drunk. You won't get in. - Yes? What are you going to do about that? Vanessa. Hey dude, are you okay? Vanessa, are you coming? - I will stay here. Okay, sorry I acted like that. Yes? Come on. You're not making fun of me here. - You really don't need me for that. That's weird, don't you think? - What? That we two are a couple. I really don't get what I ever saw in you, you know that? You're not even my type. Way too short. What about "come on" don't you understand? You're going to behave yourself, aren't you, Verstraeten. Hey? I'm still in charge here. Are you the boss, yes? I'm the boss here. The boss of your whole fucking café with lamps. We're gonna talk it out, come on. Honey, take it easy. Listen up. - Don't touch me. Say, act normal. You're not yourself. No? Then who am I? Huh? Okay sorry. I just love you. - Original way to show that. I love you too much. That's why I sometimes do stupid things. I will change. For you. - Yes. What's my favorite song, Frank? Huh? - What? What's my favourite food? Which color suits me best? Who is my best friend? What does that matter? - That's all that matters. I mean, what... What do you actually know about me? What's my dream? What keeps me awake? I'm more than just an accessory to show off sometimes. But that... You can't understand that. You are not capable of that. And I told you: I am not yours. I don't belong to anyone. You may not be mine, but all that junk is mine. That dress, I paid. Those shoes, I paid. That necklace, I paid. You know what? You can keep it. What are you going to do without me? Huh? Do you think anyone is waiting for Miss Belgium '97? Are you moving back home? I'll manage on my own. Yes? - As long as I get rid of you. You better kick the habit, stop shoving that shit up your nose. I don't know your dream, but I do know what keeps you awake at night. Do you know what you are? A pathetic, pathetic little boy. Me? - Yes you. Have a look here. Huh? Take a look in the mirror. Tell me who's pathetic. Have a look here. Huh? Your only merit in life is that you are beautiful. But believe me, it won't be long either. You know what? I'm locking you up. - Fuck you. You won't lock me up. You'll stay here until you can think straight again. What are you doing, brother? I have no lessons to learn from you. - Shut up, or I'll give you a beating. If you all think I need you, you're dead wrong. It's Frank and Black Magic, it's Frank and Vanessa. And not vice versa, yes? I don't have goddamn time for all this. Hey, Vanny. Oops, sorry. You are a godsend, girl. Svetlana. - Fuck. I know you're here. Open the door. Open the door. Dad, I... - Where is he? You're in trouble, boy. Where is he? Who are you talking about? - Dennis. Where is he? No idea. Find him and bring that bastard to me. Okay? Okay? - What did he do? Hey, fratello. Have you completely fallen on the back of your head now? The porn king needs a little love every now and then. She could be your fucking daughter. You stupid asshole. She looked good. Couldn't you just keep your pants closed? All right, Frank, how are we going to fix that? We? There is no "we". If you still want my advice: Get out of here. Where to, Frank? Guatemala, Jupiter, take your pick. Somewhere they won't find you. What about the Zillion? It will run without you. Are we going to play it like this? Then you have to buy me out. What? - A new life costs money. What do you want to buy out? Your dividends? Or rather your notarial shares? - The profit. The profit? You know... I don't have time for any of this. Then you make fucking time, sucker. What did you actually do here? Huh? Except for making trouble. Watch your words, fucking idiot. I spent 300 days in jail for you. 281. And you had better stayed there. You've forgotten who your real friends are, Frank. Friends? We're not friends, Dennis. A customer with some privileges, that was you. You must be taught a lesson. A lesson in respect. Dinah. Dina Tersago is the new Miss Belgium 2001. Is it tasty? If you want some tabasco or something... It's okay. Do you like them? Those are funeral flowers. Really? But I do like them. Hey, you, stay there. Stop, stop, stop. Where's that money, bitch? Can't hear well or something? He said: Where is that money? Upstairs. Get up, boy. Upstairs. Come on. Where's that fucking money, huh? Where's that fucking money? There, in that cupboard, in the cupboard. Come along. Pay, dude. Faster. Faster, faster. Game over, asshole. Come on, I've got the cash. Take those car keys with you too. baby. Darling. Help. Can you leave us alone for a moment? - Fine. Sorry. What happened? - I'm fine, calm down. A picture, ma'am? - A picture? I'm going to clean up here first, because this is not a good look. No, Mom, never mind. Show everyone who the victim is. How are you doing? They've got you pretty good too, haven't they, child. Marleen, that was really... That was not normal. Those were real beasts. How did they get here? Why are you asking me that? You have one of those keycards, don't you? - Mom, stop. Can't she just show her card? Or do you no longer have it? Mom, please. - What? You don't understand what we've been through, do you? I'm just asking the same questions as those cops? That's none of their business and none of yours. How many of those cards are there and who did you hand them all out to? Just go to sleep, mom. I'll fix this. Here. And where is yours? Mom, give us a minute, please. Good. I'll hear if there's anything. The robbers reportedly, together... entered Mr Verstraeten's loft... and have been extremely aggressive. The exact size of the loot is not yet known. What we do already know... is that they managed to take off with a Mercedes-Benz. Aren't you in too much pain? A little headache. You saved my life, hé. Do you know? Will you marry me? What are you saying? You heard me. Who is that? - Don't know. Chico. Scare someone else. Ludo from the garage called. They found your car. And Dennis? Mobile is off. Nobody knows where he is. Tell them to keep looking. I'll meet you downstairs in five minutes. Okay? Anything else. I also come to say that I quit. I submit my resignation. Why? Are you afraid? - It's getting a little too loco for me here. I have two little boys. - Hand in your badge at the office. Hurry up a bit. Soon the lab will be here. Here. What? - Yes, with me. I found him. Okay, call Marius. - Yes, it's okay. Come. I shouldn't have accused you. Sorry. Okay. Do you also want a cup of tea? - Yes, I would actually. Yes? - Frank, someone wants to see you. Who? Look at that. Now I see it with my own eyes. Impressive. You're lucky I'm in a good mood. You don't normally get in with such an ugly tail. My wife used to complain about that too. - Why are you here? I'd like to chat with you. I have nothing to say to you. Great, because you mainly have to listen. What are you reading? The Story, hé. It's a bit of a lurid picture, isn't it? Still romantic, I think. I really didn't know who to call. - That doesn't matter. You can count on me. I'm just really scared that Frank is going to hurt me. He needs to realize that he can't treat people like that, especially not you. Do you think you can make me jealous? - Wait a second. Now it comes. I... I know some folks who can make him understand that. What are you saying? Hey, Vanny. Are you alright? I just want to be alone for a while. - Certainly. Take your time, girl. Hello? How do you get in there? - Only with a keycard. Then you'll have to get me one. Is there a safe in that loft? Yes, in our bedroom. Why? To pay those men. But I don't want anything to happen to Frank. - No, me neither. I just want him to feel what I feel. May he experience that. What do I say now? I'm freaking out. It's Frank freaking out, not you. You just have to get out of there. But somehow I still love him. That's no reason to let yourself be treated like that, is it? No, but I still believe that we will be together forever. Don't be so naive, girl. - No, maybe not. Enough, surely? I'll keep it simple, okay? You submit the black bookkeeping to the BBI tomorrow. Let's say twelve o'clock. And I'll make that tape disappear. Another option is that the tape ends up with the investigating judge. And then your girlfriend goes to jail for about five or six years. Who is dearest to you, Verstraeten? Your Zillion or the woman of your life? That's not a dilemma, dumbass. Throw her in jail, throw away the key. What do I care? If you don't care, why are you crying? You bastard. To catch an asshole you have to become an asshole, right? Goddamn, fuck. Dennis. - Tomorrow at twelve o'clock, huh. It's not what you think. I can explain. Wait. Just explain it to the police. Get out of the way. Wait. Wait a minute. I love Frank and he loves me too. Don't touch me. Marleen? Marleen. Marleen? Your car keys. - What? Your car keys, come on. Now, faster. Marius, I was mistaken. Tell me he's not dead. Not yet. - I have millions, all for you. Just let him go, okay? Do you think it's about money? That's never... Marius. Frank, can I help? Can I bring you? - Shut up. Dennis? Shut up. Shut up. Give him a beating. Wait Shut up. Not yet. Do you think it's about money? That has never been the case. Drop dead. Drop dead. Where the hell is he? - No idea. You tell me. Go home, Frank. And if I find out you're helping him... then I'll beat you too. Drive, brother. Drive. Are you okay, Dennis? You're a cowardly dog, Frank. - Sorry. Really sorry. I'm fucking maimed. - Shoot. What happened there stays between us. Yes yes, sure. - No, I am serious. I have a reputation to uphold. If you want, you can have all that money. Then you can live like a king. Wherever you want. Listen, eh Frank. I've always had a lot of respect for you. You and me, the porn king and the disco king. The world was at our feet. And you screwed up. Do you know what the difference is between the two of us? You are not a man of honor. Dennis doesn't need your money. I know it doesn't seem like it... but you are my friend, Dennis. Maybe my only one. You don't know what friendship is, fratello. I need cigarettes. It was Vanessa. That homejacking, the bitch knew about it. That bitch is the only one you got left. What have you done? - Shut up, Ronny. Open that door. Are you OK? What? It's a very delicate operation, so we... Where is she? Honey, they're operating on her. - Operating? For a concussion? I'm afraid it's a bit more complicated than that. During the check we found suspicious cells. Since your mother already has a history... That fall saved her life, the doctor said. Because otherwise they would never have found out. Do you know I've only cried twice in my life? The first time was in 1988, on November 13. Do you know why? That was the first time a chess computer could beat a human. I had to cry... because it felt like I had won myself. I've always understood computers better than people. A computer, it... It doesn't spit on you. It doesn't laugh at you. And it does what you ask. Every time again. The second time I cried... was today. Because I realized... that you are more important... than all those computers together. Darling... Vanessa... you have to tell me something. And I want you to be honest. Please answer my question. Which question? Whether you want to get married. Are you serious? You heard me. Marry. You, me. Simple question. Simple answer. You're crazy. You know that right? That is why we fit well together. You're as crazy as I am. Five years in prison, that wasn't enough. Vanessa got life, with me. And that she made a mistake, I know that too, but... I hope you understand my choice... and that you respect it. And nothing or no one could change that. Are you OK? What is it? Can help come please? I think this is enough evidence to arrest Miss Goossens. Now you have to explain to me, Nico... how you obtained this material without my permission. What do you mean? I had it? - Oh yeah? Is that written on paper somewhere? Tackaert had made one big mistake. He had underestimated Frank Verstraeten. And to deal with those eastern blockers, I did something I had never done before. Police, hands up. - What is this, assholes? I called the police myself. Hands behind your back. Hands behind your back. And if it were up to me, my story would have ended here. With a happy ending. In the 'notorious and famous' category... the Flemish showbiz couple who just announced their engagement. Who are Frank Verstraeten and Vanessa Goossens? Correct. Hello? How did you get in? - Come with me. That's not allowed. - Let those people do their job. Miss Goossens. - Come with me. Marleen Verstraeten had her own way... to show she didn't understand my decision. With that black bookkeeping everything came to light. Large-scale fraud, bribery, extortion, prohibited weapons... The whole can of worms opened up. And the Zillion, it closed. I got two years unconditional, four years probation... and a 10-year profession ban. Plus a monster fine of 2.9 million euros for tax evasion. And that bothered me the most. Couldn't they just make that three million? a set of record players, Technics SL-1200. Yes, Madam. 20,000 francs, right here in the front of the room. Who offers more? And everyone went their separate ways. Yes, I see an offer. Mister in the middle, 40,000 francs. No one more than 40,000 francs? Up front, 40,000 francs. And we move on to perhaps the most exotic item of this auction... namely this albino tiger python. Yes, sir back there. 30,000 francs. No one more than 30,000 francs? Assigned to Mr. 30,000 francs. Congratulations. Mayor Vanacker was not re-elected. And honestly, I think he was happy about that. Have a nice trip, girl. Black Magic went to try his luck in Prague... in his own words the porn capital of Europe. The king went to reclaim his throne. To the ground. Unfortunately for him, messing with young girls was also illegal in the Czech Republic. I can't really have a conversation here... Mama was right, as always. Prison wasn't for Vanessa. I've talked to the lawyers. This isn't over yet. Wrap it up. Come on, back to the cell. Until next week? - Yes. That was the last time I saw her. Please, a coupe kiwi. And here, the bresilienne. Enjoy. How much is it? 360 francs. Or, well, 9 euros. Oh, Frank, don't you forget to take out the trash, boy. Yes, mom. After a few years in jail... Mama finally had me back where she loved me most. The little one was back in Meise. But if you remember one thing about my story, it's this. It's not because you're the smallest that you can't become the biggest.
