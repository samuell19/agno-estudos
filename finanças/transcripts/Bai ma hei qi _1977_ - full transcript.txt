You call him, bring out the phone, there, 266-366 and-- - Hey, no one ever gets through on that number. Now, now, the best solution is you resign and let me handle this. - Why should I? - Huh, he can explain that better than I can. - I have an idea, let Shu Fu be his deputy, what do you say? - Hmm? - I have no objections. So we have a new sheriff here at last. - Uh. - All right. (laughing) - I now confirm that you are sheriff of Wu Yu village with powers to enforce the law.

(wordless choral music) (blows thudding) (fighters exclaiming) (fighters groaning) (joints cracking) (blows thudding) (fighters exclaiming) (wordless choral music) (people murmuring) (people exclaiming) (people chattering) - That's called flicking tiger's whiskers. - Ah, you're wrong there, very wrong. Take off your trousers. - Bolo works for the people. And he's not interested in money. But nobody stands up to defend him. - Hey, well that's the way the world is, I'm afraid. Whenever there's any danger, everyone takes cover. - [Man] Oh, well done, well done. (people chattering) - Here you are. - oh, thank you. - [Man In Vest] Good. Now, now, here, come here. (man in vest laughing) (heroic string music) Please accept my confidence in you. - Bolo is innocent. I don't think he could fool everybody. Shu Fu is trading in girls, that's illegal. - You said Shu Fu is trading in girls, any witnesses? - Yes me. - But the law requires there be two witnesses. - I've got lots of 'em. Everyone knows Shu Fu is in the business of trading in girls. They know only too well, but they're scared of him. Why don't you come forward as witnesses? - Hey, stop tryin' to make trouble for us. - He's crazy, you go back home. - Now, go to the next village and borrow their scaffold from them. (Pao whimpering) (lively Asian music) - Hello. - Hi. Huh? - [Woman] Hey, let's go, let's go. (Pao sighing) - Hey mister, can you tell me who's the boss around here? - He is. - Oh. And your name sir? - I'm Shu. - Oh, my father asked me to borrow your scaffold for awhile. - But did I say you could? - Uh, not you, my father did. - You've come to the wrong place, we've got no scaffolds. - [Pao] Oh, oh. - Hey, do they want to execute Bolo? - Hey, hey, since your father went away, has he scolded anybody? - He hasn't. - But I sent a man to take him some food. Did your father get it? He's not come back. - Not yet, but thanks anyway. - If he's still to come, tell him to let me have it. I wanna eat it! - But what is it? - It's a rat. - A rat? - A rat? (men exclaiming) - Yeah, it's a rat! - Ah! (men exclaiming) - One scaffold will cost $100. - Huh, have you gone crazy? (slap resounds) Ow! - No, I've not, but maybe you have. - Huh, why'd you hit me? - Sh. (gentle music) (birds twittering) Lower your voice. - Oh, is that low enough? (smack resounds) - Huh? Now I get it, you must be the smiling killer, aren't you? - Mm-mm, no I'm not. I am known as the Grim Reaper. - Oh! - Grim Reaper! (swords clanking) (fighters exclaiming) (Ma groaning) (men exclaiming) (men chattering) (lively music) - [Man] No, no, uh. (thugs exclaiming) - Hmm? (blows thudding) (fighters exclaiming) (Ma yelling) Mm. Mm? (Ma yelling) (thugs exclaiming) (playful music) (all exclaiming dementedly) - He wants $100 for one scaffold? - What's the name of the guy you spoke to? - He's called Shu. - So, it's Shu, but he's not boss. - Why'd he do it? - He started goin' crazy two years ago, so they had to retire him. - Bao, where's Bolo? - Bolo? He's gonna stand trial. (man slurping) - Hey, Fatty. You've eaten all the rice, there's none left for Bolo. (man gulping) (wings flapping) (dramatic music) - Huh? Captain, they're coming now. - Get ready, you know what to do. I'm countin' on ya. (suspenseful music) - [Pao] Hey. - [Guard] Hey, what do you want? - The captain. See, I have a letter for him. - Let me see. (Ma chuckling) Wait here. - [Ma] Yeah. - Uh, I'm afraid you've just come too late. There's a new law startin' today. We only deal with strangers here. You deal with him yourself. - I see. Huh, so I've no choice. Go on, move, move! - Hold it. - Huh? (chuckling) - That'll be $50. - Huh, what for? - Regulations, a service charge. - Rats! (Ma grunting) (Bolo grunting) (china clattering) (Ma grunting) - Hold it. - Huh? What is it this time? - You have to pay 50 more. - Regulations? - No, charity. - What charity? - For the poor. The police administer a poor fund. (Ma grumbling) (coins clanking) - Hey, well I'm poor now, do I qualify? - Uh, I'll help ya out. (both men vocalizing) (Ma stuttering) - It's ridiculous, what are you thinking? - Put 20 more on her. - But what for? I've broken no law. - [Captain] Cruelty to animals. (workers grunting) - Hey, could you sign for it? - Price is right, please sign for it. That's six bags. Mm-hmm, right, thank you sir. - Right, thank you. - See you. Captain, how about Bolo? - Forget about him. - Wha? - Hey Fatty, I told you to deliver rice, but what are they doing here? - Huh, huh? (wordless choral music) (shirtless man groaning) What do you want? - See a prisoner. - [Shirtless Man] A prisoner? - Who the hell are you? - I'm Sweetie Pie. (wordless choral music) - (chuckling) And your sister's called Honey Child. - [Honey Child] Is there a wedding? - Hey, you're crazy, you just take it. I'm afraid you mustn't come here again, ever again. - All right, one condition. - What's that? - Give me a kiss. - Huh? (wordless choral music) (Bolo smooching) - I think she really fancies you. (wordless choral music) (chuckling) Sure she does, a lovely pair. And when are you gonna have a child? (Bolo growling) (Bolo snarling) (playful music) (crickets chirping) (owls hooting) (blows thudding) (fighters exclaiming) (bald man whimpering) (blows thudding) (fighters exclaiming) - No, please, please, please, please stop, please! No, no no, no, don't, oh! (yelling) Please, don't, help! (blow thudding) (Ma yelling) (blows thudding) (fighters exclaiming) (laughing) Thank you, Mr. Ma. (laughing) (blows thudding) (fighters exclaiming) - On one condition. - Huh? - What's that? (blows thudding) (blows thudding) (fighters exclaiming) - You're gonna have to tell me where the gold is hidden. (bald man stuttering) - [Bald Man] But I don't know what you're talking about. (bald man groaning) (blows thudding) - Do you know now? - Uh huh. (blows thudding) (bald man whimpering) - Yes, oh yes! (blows thudding) (fighters exclaiming) - Escape. - Oh, no, no! - Will you talk? - Yes, yes. (blows thudding) (fighters exclaiming) (bald man groaning) I'll talk, I promise. (blow thudding) (groaning) - All right, I won't ask you again. Where's the gold being hidden? - But I don't know! (blows thudding) (fighters exclaiming) All right, that's a fact! (weapon whooshing) (bald man groaning) (suspenseful music) (ominous music) - Presumably you know what happened last night. - Yes. - Well, there's no need to be nervous, now calm down. Bolo's been sentenced to jail for life. But I've been checkin' on the bill, which is gettin' too large. The prisoner's eaten far too much food. One bag of rice for three days. If Bolo carries on livin' for another 20 years, he's gonna reduce us all to being paupers. - I have an idea. Fatty eats almost as much food as Bolo does. If we fire Fatty, we can pay for Bolo's food. - If we fire Fatty, who's gonna watch Bolo? He might escape. - That'd be all right. We wouldn't have any expense then. Aren't I right? - Hmm. - Hey, and this is your share. (Bolo grunts) (playful music) - [Bolo] Isn't it time this whole crazy show stopped? - Don't worry, in a minute; we have to be more patient. - Huh? You'd better not double cross me. - How dare you say a think like that. Haven't we always been the best of friends, haven't we? - What is it? - Uh, he refuses to leave. - Hmm? - He's staying. - What? Hey, let's speak frankly together. Now why don't you want to leave prison, huh? - Well it's comfortable here. And if I do leave, where else am I gonna get food? - So you want to stay forever, huh? - He's even found a wife, he wants to settle here. - If you're trickin' me, I'll blow your cover! - Come on. - What's that? It's nothing, he's just sick. - Oh, but is it serious? Huh? Hey, where's he feeling sick? - Oh, first you pay me, then I'll tell you everything. - Oh, forget it, we'll leave it be, huh? Now, you tell me what's wrong with you. Hmm. Hmm. - Don't keep goin' on like that. You just pay me and I'll leave, I'll go somewhere else. - This is mine. This is yours. (gentle music) This is mine. This is yours. This is mine. And this is yours. This is mine. - All right. One, two, three, four, five. - One, two, three, four five. - That's right. - Bolo, you've been in jail too long. I'm sorry it had to happen. Take it, this is yours, take it. - Oh? I must say, you're right, all right. (coin clattering) And this is for you, 'cause you're such a good friend. - Oh, I shouldn't take this, thanks a lot. (gentle music) All right, now that we've divided up the money, we must get out of here before sunrise tomorrow. (Bolo grunting) Bolo, come here. Do you wanna make a fortune again? - What, are you kiddin' me? Where is it? - The bank, I've checked it already. - When do we go? - Tonight. (playful music) (Pao and woman gasping) - [Masked Man] Put your hands up, do as I tell ya. - Have a drink. - Huh? - [Pao] Here. Cheers. (Pao wheedling) (cups clinking) (Pao exhaling) (Pao awkwardly laughing) - Now open the safe. - Oh oh, yeah, yeah. (playful music) - Now take out all the money. - Yes. - It's all your fault, I said we should close out, but you didn't listen. - Take it easy! He's still got some gold left. (clattering) (woman exclaims) - Hey, I reckon Bolo's the only man in Wu Yu village with the strength to break a brick. - [Robber] Well I'm not Bolo. - [Pao] You hold it there. - [Robber] What for? - You drank from that cup I gave you, the one that I put into the safe. You can do what you want now, but the cops will have your fingerprints, and that'll prove that you're guilty. - [Robber] Ah, I see. (Bolo grunting) (weapons whooshing) (woman gasping) (Pao groaning) - Hey, uh, you hurry, you're in deep trouble this time, huh? - But the fingerprints will prove he tried to kill me. Oh, my aching, ouch. (groaning) - Here, here, you can take it. You'll have to calculate your own accounts, I'm afraid, okay? (Pao groaning) (woman exclaiming) (suspenseful music) (crickets chirping) (dramatic music) - Have you got it? - Here, it's all there. - [Ma] Oh. Hey, you're in deep trouble. - [Bolo] Why? - [Ma] Did you kill Fatty or didn't ya? - I did. - Well the cops are looking for you. - [Bolo] Oh, what shall I do? (birds twittering) (dramatic organ music) (rooster crowing) - [Ma] Now our task is completed, I've got the gold, and with this money we can build a hospital. I'll see you later. - Ha. Where the hell have you been? - Having a tinkle. - Why so long? - Huh? - Don't look around, but someone's coming, let's go. - Right. (gentle string music) (birds twittering) What are you doin' there? - Having a rest. - Why rest up there? - [Ma] So I can see if anyone is coming before they can see me. (branches rustling) (birds twittering) (bright synthesized music) (water splashing) - Here. - Thank you. Heh. - Huh? (blow thudding) - Hey. There's a shark. - Huh? Hey, hey, hey! - Huh? - The boat's gone. - A shark! - Where is it? - Use your left hand to hold onto my right foot, come on. Hurry up! (Ma yelling) (water splashing) (both vocalizing faintly) (dramatic music) - He looks like he's some kind of big shot. - Huh, I think he's the brother of Shu Fu. He runs a kung fu gym. He's nicknamed the Half Lotus in Canton. (dramatic music) - Yes, we are brothers, and we stick together. And his enemy is my enemy. - Hey, is he talkin' to us? - If you ask me, trouble's brewing. I'm gonna have to use force. - Ho. - Huh? Don't try to stop me, I'll do it, I can do it. (blows thudding) (fighters exclaiming) (fighters exclaiming) (blows thudding) - [Brother Of Shu] Strike lower! Strike lower! (fighters exclaiming) (fighters exclaiming) (blows thudding) - You heard him, strike lower. - [Bolo] Right. (blows thudding) (fighters exclaiming) - [Ma] Go for his left. (blows thudding) (fighters exclaiming) - The man's a cheat, go on, teach him. (blows thudding) (fighters exclaiming) - Get him. (blows thudding) (fighters exclaiming) - [Brother Of Shu] Get him! - Get in there! (blows thudding) (fighters exclaiming) Seems like your guy's lost. (blows thudding) (fighters exclaiming) - The snake! (blows thudding) (fighters exclaiming) - [Ma] Get him! (blows thudding) (fighters exclaiming) - [Brother Of Shu] Harder! (blows thudding) (fighters exclaiming) - Finish him off!

(fighters exclaiming) (blows thudding) (weapon clattering) (Bolo groaning) - This is called fire in the garden. - Ah? (blows thudding) (fighters exclaiming) (Bolo's body whistling like missile) (something reverberating) (man in pants groaning) - Huh, did I do that? - Yes, of course you did. (somber music) (somber string music) - Now what the hell do you think you're doing? How dare you try to cheat me and rob my bank, huh? - You're trading in girls and stealing from the people. You're the thief, and you killed the old sheriff. Everyone thought that there must be a bandit chief. But it was you all the time. - Huh, since you know so much, I'm gonna have to shut your mouth for good. - Well I reckon he's Japanese. - Huh, well I reckon he's really the brother of Pao. - You are right, Pao is my master, I'm the champion of Japan. - What, at cooking beef steak? - No, at judo, swordplay, karate. (body thudding) Master, I have learned from you, please let me get them.

(shield reverberating) (Pao grunting) - We're gonna have to find our own teacher to teach us kung fu before we can beat him. - I don't think we've got the time. - I see, then what can we do? - God is with us. - So he is! (blows clanging) (fighters exclaiming) (Ma yelling) (blows clanging) (fighters exclaiming) (attacker yelling) (wrench squeaking) What are you doin'? - It's all right. (blow thudding) (Bolo groaning) - (laughing) Huh? (blows thudding) (fighters exclaiming) - Huh? - The combined forces. (blows thudding) (gentle wordless vocal music) (jaunty whistling) (gentle wordless vocal music) (blows thudding) (joints cracking) - [Pao] Oh, please don't kill me. - We're gonna break both your legs. - I'm gonna smash your belly. (attacker groaning) - I'm gonna chop you down. (attacker groaning) - I'm gonna cut off your head. - Please don't do that, don't hit me where it hurts, please don't. I prefer you kill me instead. (blow thudding) (Pao groaning) - Finished? - Yeah, but not quite, let's go. (gentle guitar music) Better leave that there, come on. - [Bolo] Huh, huh, huh? (lively guitar music) Hey!
