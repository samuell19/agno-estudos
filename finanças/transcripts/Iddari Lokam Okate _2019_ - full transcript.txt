We don't know how, when and on whom love blooms No one knows how many twists and turns, halts and memories are there in that journey. Love is always a surprise. It is merely a coincidence. [thunder rumbles] [writhing in labour pain] NOVEMBER 16, 1993. OOTY. Could you please hurry? [writhing in labour pain] [tyre screeches] Please drive fast. We are almost there. Try to bear it for a while. Just another five minutes. Faster. Please hurry. We are almost there. [heart pounds] The baby's heartbeat appears to be normal. The baby wasn't moving since yesterday. We got here because we were scared. There is nothing to fear. It's quite common. Calm yourselves down. She isn't due for another ten days. Bring her at that time. Okay, doctor. Do you think the doctor examined properly? Why do you find it so hard to believe? Then, why can't I sense the baby's movements in my womb? Calm yourselves down. Wouldn't doctor's inform us if there is a problem? Careful. Please hurry. We are almost there. Bear for a while. Watch out! [tyres screech] Oh no! Hey! Valli... The amniotic fluid is leaking. Please call the doctor. Doctor... Oh no! We are almost there... [groans in labour pain] Please make it fast. [groans in labour pain] You wait here... [woman screams] [baby cries] -I'll give a copy to you. -Thank you. AFTER 7 DAYS Hasn't it been a week since your daughter's been born? Start using medication from now on. Please follow the vaccination chart. Thank you, doctor. Actually, I have to apologise to you. That day, when you told me that the baby wasn't moving... I've checked the heartbeat and thought that everything was alright with the baby. But we understood the situation only when we performed the caesarean, that the umbilical cord was tied around the baby's neck and every time she moved, it got tightened. If you had gone home that day, you would have lost your baby for sure. That accident was sheer luck and was what ultimately saved your daughter. IDDARI LOKAM OKATE AFTER 25 YEARS PRESENT DAY, HYDERABAD [birds chirp] "And just like that..." "the dreams have woven their web" "I am running towards you" "to make those dreams come true" "You are like a cloud that poured colour and like a melodious tune" -"Like a sprint that knows to take pause" -Wow! Very delicious! Taste it! -"Let's walk beside each other" -Bro! It's 'Babai Tiffin Centre', buddy. The fritters here are excellent. Pullover. Eating this kind of street food would give you diarrhoea, malaria, diphtheria, filaria, gonorrhoea... Tsk! The number of diseases you listed is longer than the items on their menu. I don't want them anymore... Move. [people sobbing] -Why are you bringing me here? -Come. How could you have left us this soon, mother-in-law? In unison: Mother-in-law... How could you have left without informing us, mother-in-law? In unison: Mother-in-law... Who is now going to obsessively watch TV serials, mother-in-law? In unison: Mother-in-law... Mother-in-law? Isn't it the father-in-law who passed away? Is this Bittiri Satti's house? No. This is Attili Satti's house. Do you call this acting? The appropriate term for it according to Hollywood is 'Character Study'. This is called insanity here. As if you would know. Sit down. -"And just like that..." -[camera clicks] "the dreams have woven their web " "I am running towards you" "to make those dreams come true " Hey! This is Varsha. My age is 25 years. I am from Coonoor. "A beautiful painting depicts emotions that cannot be expressed in words" "Heart can see the beauty that the eye cannot" "Those eyes spill beautiful secrets and are a picture in themselves," "so are those lips that spill beautiful words" "All these little games and little moments together make up a month" "Let's go on and do what we have decided and achieve our dreams" "Let's take a step towards the goals that our hearts have desired" "Hello... Hello... Hello, my love..." "Do something crazy to make me yours" My life would take a turn if I got selected in this audition, mom. All the best, dear. Hey, what are you doing here? Keep it there... Go. "Life remains delightful despite ups and downs" "A shining rain drop and a pouring light when combined, make the rainbow" "A laugh amongst friends has a different shade" "and the laugh in my heart has a different shade" "Be the colour that makes me smile a little and brings me ringing joy" "Life is so small wanna smile... want some memories the size of smile" "Every hour and every minute, wanna wanna give it my signature" "Hello... Hello... Hello, my love..." "Do something crazy to make me yours" "Hello... Hello... Hello, my joy..." "do something and rain your dreams all over me like a rainbow" They will give us a script. We have to prepare from it. -Hi... -Hi... Where is the director? He's over there. Thank you. Hi, sir. No need to be so formal. Just call me Mukhesh. Mukhi, I am here to audition for the role of the heroine. Mukhi? Haha... Sit down. -What's your name? -Varsha. It's for the role of the heroine, isn't it? Yes. What are your previous works? I've attended the auditions for roles in Arjun Reddy,118, Mahanati, Bahubali, Rangasthalam and many more films. Unfortunately, I wasn't selected. You seem very enthusiastic to become a Heroine. But the thing is... I don't take artists' auditions in a regular manner. Me too. I won't give routine performances. It would completely different. I'll give you a situation... I want you to call some stranger and convince them with your performance. Then, I will give you the role of a lead actress. That's a brilliant idea. What's the scene? -Some people have kidnapped you... -Help... Help... Somebody help me! Hold on. Hold on. Cooldown... Cooldown... I want you to act while you are on the phone with the stranger. -I will observe you. -Okay. I'm ready, sir. A group of people kidnapped you and stuffed you in the boot of a car. -What car is it? -It's a Skoda. Luckily, there is a phone in the car. Phone password? Don't worry about that. It doesn't have a password. They have taken you to a bungalow and tied you up. Where is that bungalow located? The kidnappers won't tell you their locations or even the Pincode. Are you here to give audition or on a police enquiry? -I was bothered about logics... -That's my problem. Just call the person and report the situation. Convince them, make them believe and break down in tears. And if possible, make them come all the way here. For the role of the heroine, right? Yes. Get started. Mom, I have been kidnapped. I am very scared. Please rescue me, mom. What? What are you saying? Kidnap? Mom... I don't know what to do... Please rescue me. How did it happen? Where are you? I don't know, mom. This looks to be an abandoned bungalow. They have tied my limbs up. They have even taken away my phone. Mom, they have even covered my mouth with tape. -I am bleeding from my nose. -Varsha... I have a lot of work to do now. Call me in the evening if you want to practice your acting skills. Bye. Mom... Mom... Please believe me... Please. With your hands tied and your phone snatched away, how are you able to call me? Oh man! They taped your mouth shut and and your nose is bleeding... Stop these shenanigans. Disconnect the call. She didn't believe you, right? Uhuh... One more call? Varsha, tell me. What's up? Someone kidnapped me... at least there is no water She surpasses the great actress Savithri. They covered my mouth with tape. I'm scared. -Please help me. -Enough. Hang up! Same reaction? Even if you have called the police and acted this way, they wouldn't believe either. Please leave. [laughs] How would I know that you were auditioning for a role? Never mind, mother. It was all because of you that I've lost the audition. Alright, dear. Don't behave this way in front of Rahul's parents. Moreover, it's your first time meeting with them. Rahul is the one who made the first move and asked for your hand. He has been waiting for you for three years. Varsha... Are you listening to me? Hmm... [car alarm blips] Oh no! Mom... No western clothes... No ripped jeans... No patchwork shirts... Wear a saree... Wear jewellery... Wear a bindi... Isn't that all? Yes. That's all. Where do you think I'm going, for a dinner or to a temple? Bye. [indistinct chatter] A very good thought, sir. -Thank you, sir. -Best of luck. Mahi... It's been a long time since I've seen you. My darling... How are you doing? I am good. Aunty, let's see the exhibition. Let's go. Okay. Mom, Varsha is here. I am telling you once again. Please don't discuss her profession. Please. You might have reminded me that for at least fifty times by now. -Hi. -Hi. Come on. Over there. -Hello, aunty. -Hello... Come, sit. -Hi, uncle. -Hello, dear. Sit down. You look very beautiful in a saree. Thanks, aunty. I love watching movies but I don't have a very good opinion on the movie artists. Ah! I am known to call a spade for what it is. Mom, what did I tell you? I mean... what did I tell? Say something... But I don't mince my words. Women should get married and look after the house. Is it necessary for women from our families to get into the movie business? Mom, we are here to have dinner. Your mother is already in the middle of having her full. I felt very happy after I heard about your decision. What are you talking about, aunty? I heard you have decided to quit acting. Mom, do you want me to order? Varsha... What about you? Father, would you like me to order something for you? Aunty, even I'm like you. I don't mince my words either. It's my life's ambition to become a heroine. Making things like getting married and taking care of the house were probably priorities in your generation. But for us, it's all about our dreams and making those come true. Women are in no way inferior to men, aunty. They are far superior to them in all the aspects. What do you say, uncle? That's true... That's true. Have you asked for the bill? -We haven't ordered yet. -Is it? [phone rings] Isn't it cold in here? [scoffs] Geeta, Rahul's mother words were very weird. This doesn't look like a family meeting. This looks like a plan hatched to make me quit acting. We heard you were auditioning for heroine roles and felt very upset! I don't mince my words. Women should get married and look after the house. Is it necessary or women from our families to get into the movie industry? I call a spade a spade. Ah! Hello? Varsha... Varsha... Hello. So, you want me to apologise to your mother? Never mind. Why would you tell them that I will quit acting? Why did you lie to them that I would quit acting? They came to meet you only when I told them like that. It's been three years. They kept nagging me with questions about quitting your profession. So... you decided that I would quit acting. I didn't decide for you. I just tried to manage the situation. If only you had been silent for two minutes, it would have all been fine. It wouldn't have been fine, Rahul. It's my life's ambition to become a heroine. It isn't just a silly little wish. What they think of me and my life is not of any concern for me. What do you think? How much longer, Varsha? You have been at it for three years now. Have you made any headway at all? Have you ever supported me? Whenever I did get an opportunity in a movie, you'd come up with some complaint citing problems with the role or company and held me back in every aspect. What is it that you are saying? That I am responsible for your failure? So, you have decided that I am a failure. So I should succumb to your decisions. -Is that so? -I didn't mean that, Varsha. Stop the car. Stop the car! [tyres screech] [vehicles honking] Varsha... -Varsha... Please stop. Listen to me. -Move the car... -Varsha... -What is it in the middle of the road? -Move your car... -Just wait, you guys! Ow! [groans] -Excuse me. -Yes. -Who is the organiser of this exhibition? -You will find them there. Oh! Okay. Thank you. [camera clicks] Hello... Everyone We are very thankful for accepting our invitation and coming here. [phone rings] Ever since the advent of the mobiles, there is a camera in everybody's hand. But if we go back to 20 years, we had only one photo studio per village. [phone rings] Rahul, I am very busy. -I'll call you later. Bye... -Varsha... Varsha... Tsk! All the photos that you see right now have been clicked in such a photo studio. There is a story behind every photo. There is life in these pictures. And the one to give life to these pictures is my father... Mr Anantha Murthy. [phone rings] He didn't just run the studio for the money What's your problem? Varsha, I've parked the vehicle in the wrong place. There is a heavy traffic. This will become a big problem. -Alright. I'll be there.-He never felt photography as profession. He considered it to be his life. He used to say one thing all the time. Only the camera has the power to capture the time. Dad had a small photo studio in Ooty. [camera clicks] In a day, he shot photos for at least ten clients... And he did that for forty years. Of the many photos that he took, there were the ones that were in displayable condition. Unfortunately, he passed away a year ago. I felt that the only way I could show my gratitude and respect for my father's work and talent... and the gratitude of all those in these photographs is to organize this exhibition Thanks a lot for being a part of this happy occasion. [applause] I am sorry, Varsha. I shouldn't have spoken to you like that. Varsha... It's quite common in every relationship to have these kind of minor misunderstandings. This might be a small issue for you, Rahul. But for me, it is a huge issue. You are asking me to give up on my life's ambition. Don't quit. Okay? No, Rahul. If you and your mom share the same opinion, I think we should give this relationship a second thought. Come on, Varsha. Think. It's just a bad day. It's really a bad day. Then, let's make it a good day. What is this? Car... Gift. If everything went smoothly, the car would have been delivered today. Bad luck... It got postponed for tomorrow. Go and pick it up from the showroom tomorrow. Varsha, I am leaving to the US tonight, on a business work. I will be back in three to four months. I don't want any gift, Rahul. There would be happiness in getting things that are earned from hard work, be it a car or a career. Please don't mind. And, it's me. Geeta! I told you I didn't want these darned heels. They are broken again. Alright, fine. I'll never order online again. Well... Why did you disconnect the call suddenly, a while ago? What would it be! When I was on the call with you, I saw Rahul's mother in the mirror. She looked as determined as Dhoni does in a cricket match. Was it a catch? Stumped! [laughs] Look at this. Hey, was this taken when you were a baby? I have a feeling that it is my photo. But, it's yet to be confirmed. Please, click it in this pose. It looks worst. Please try to understand. -Ok, let's try this pose... -I'll just go and ask him. You stay here. -Okay.-Smile a bit! Ee... -Excuse me. [camera clicks] -Yes. -The girl in that picture... -She is my girlfriend. Girlfriend? -Shouldn't I have one? -What's her name? -I don't know. -Where is she from? -I don't remember. -Do you at least know what she does? -Tsk! Huh! It's 10 am, right? She might be having breakfast. Why would you ask me that? Try to understand. Every photograph here has a story. Each of it has a life too. And so, they have a bit of love too, in them. This is my love story. -Hello. -What? That is the girl in your love story. -[gasps] She looks superb! -Hey! -You are superb too! -You... Mahi, one more family member is here. [laughs] Hi... Do you know whose photo this is? Why do you ask? I have a feeling that the girl in this photo is me. I wanted to know how this picture came into your possession. Don't you remember your own photo? I know it sounds funny when I say it but it's true. I don't have even a single childhood photo of mine. That's why I am unable to be so sure of it. You used to live in Ooty, weren't you? My grandfather used to live in Ooty. I am from Coonoor. -This photograph was clicked in Ooty. -In Ooty? Yes. It was your grandfather who got your photograph taken. I was there as well. -What? Really? -Yeah. We are friends. -Friends? -Yes, Varsha. Varsha? I am really shocked. -Stand here in front of the photo... -Why? -It's for the cover of the magazine. -Yeah! [camera clicks] I have no memory of this photo ever being taken. After you got your photo clicked, nobody came to collect it. Maybe that's why you don't remember it. [camera clicks] [phone vibrates] One second. Is it? Where is the audition? [camera clicks] At Puri sir's office? I am coming. Sorry. I have some work. I really have to go. I will meet you later. It's okay. If you come to the studio tomorrow, I will give you the originals of your photo. -We will talk then. -Yeah. Give her our card. Thank you -Bye. I will see you. -Bye. Let's go. He is really a good photographer. He has won so many awards too. Since when did you want to a photographer? My father is a photographer. I observed him very closely. But when I was eight, I had a bicycle accident due to a girl and from then, I've developed an interest in photography. Play it again. Play it again. But when I was eight, I had a bicycle accident due to a girl and from then, I've developed an interest in photography. 2001, OOTY Hey! -Grandpa... -Varsha, my angel! -How have you been, father? -I am good, dear. -Her holidays started from yesterday. -We're getting delayed to office. Hurry. -We will come on Sunday. -Alright. Bye, dear. -Bye, mom. -Bye, dad. Hahaha... [laughs] Very good! Grandpa, did you get all of these? Of course! What did you think your grandfather was? Your Grandpa was the crown prince of the theatre. When I grow up, I will also become a bigger actor than you ever were, Grandpa. Why not? Of course! You will become like the legendary actress Savitri. -Grandpa... -Yes. Where are the fishes? Oh no, dear. They are dead. The pet shop uncle said he would give us new ones. -I will go and get it. -Okay. [children chatter] -Out of the way! -Hey! Oh God! [crying] -Thank you. -You are welcome. -My name is Varsha. -My name is Mahi. -Friends? -Friends. -Bye. -Bye. Mahi... -Yes? I'll see you tomorrow, right? Done. "Once upon a time..." "the story began like this" "One was a raindrop and the other was the foliage..." "and they've become pair like this " "The friendship started" "they've called themselves to be half of each other" "And by and by," "their worlds merged" "Once upon a time..." "the story began thus" "One was a raindrop and the other was the foliage..." "and they've become pair like this " Varsha, this box is looks wonderful. My grandpa gifted me this for my birthday. I'd hide my favourite things in this box. This is my treasure box Can I see? It is just like you. [toy squeaks] [laughs] Bangles? These are my bangles. -What about this? -This is my favourite whistle. [whistles] [indistinct TV playing] Oh no! Grandpa... Is that girl dead? It's just acting. Nothing is going to happen to the girl. Watch... Watch... TV: Hey, mister! Can't you see? -Phew! So, she is fine?-That is called acting. To be called an actor, you should be able to evoke all the nine emotions. You have to breathe life into the roles you undertake. Then, I will do it too. Hey! Enough with the nonsense. Just eat. He is enough... to pamper her. [bicycle bell tinkles] -Hey... -Oh... -Ow! -Ouch! Are you badly hurt? -Nothing at all... -Tsk! Shh! -Do you know how to take a picture? -I do. -Will you take mine? -Hey! When? -Umm... After the wounds heal... -Okay. You have to be silent. -She isn't bruised much. -Okay, sir. You can take her home. -Grandpa. -Take care, dear. Come Varsha. Come. -Are you alright ? -Yes.. For the next two days, make sure that your boy doesn't ride the bicycle and indulge in any strenuous physical activity. -Okay, doctor. -You can go... -Slowly... -Slowly... What is this for, grandpa? Life is like a theatrical play. On this stage, one encounters unimagined experiences. If you write those memories in a book like this, from fading away with time, they will stay alive forever. Then, can I write about that boy who rides the bicycle? Yes. But he got bruised because of me. Do you think he will be friends with me? Why wouldn't he be friends with you? Friendship gets stronger when there are problems. [laughs] Father, I want to go out and play with my friends. No, son. Let's play chess. I don't like this game. At least give me my bicycle. Just be patient. Once you are healed, I will give it to you. -Mahi, take your medicine. -I don't want it. I will not take it. Hey.. Come, let's play. Uhuh! [indistinct children chatter] [fire crackling] Do you know how to take a picture? -I do. Will you take mine? Dad, will you teach me photography? Every photograph needs to have a story. There should be life in every photograph. Look there. Look at that on the tree... [camera clicks] As time passes, many things that have touched our heart are forgotten. [camera clicks] If those kind of beautiful memories aree captured in a photograph, they will remain with us forever. [camera clicks] Uhuh! Hey! What's up, my little darling? Why are you dull? The boy who rides the bicycle isn't coming. You have a lot of friends, don't you? He told me that he will take my photograph. Is that all? I will get the photo of my angel taken. -No, I don't want to come. -Why? What if the bicycle boy comes here, after we leave? -Listen to your grandpa, darling. Come. -Hmm... I will return after giving your father his lunch. You sit and watch TV. -I'll go and give him his lunch. -No, son. I'll go. I will not run. I will walk slowly. Please, mother. Please... Please... Okay, careful. Little girl, keep your head straight. Smile. Smile a little. Like this... Look at the camera lens. This side.. I will count one, two and three, you'll have to flash a beautiful smile. Okay? One... two... -Father... -Three. [gasps] [laughs] That's good. Look at me. [camera clicks] Sir, Photos will be ready in two days. Let me give you the receipt. I will come and click it. -Will you take my picture? -Yes. Mwah! -Hi. -Hi, please come. Yeah. You have such a nice place. Hey, isn't that you? Not bad. You did recognize me. The thing is that... This diary is the main reason for me to recognise you than that photograph. Look. Reading: Just as I saw the heroine on the TV yesterday, I jumped on the guy who rode a bicycle. It means you jumped on my bicycle intentionally? All these days, I was under the impression that I was responsible for that accident. -Sorry... Sorry... Sorry... -It's okay. Anyways, how can you not have a single photo of yours? I lost a few of them when we changed houses... and a few of them when we changed places. And also, I lost them from my memories as well. Thank you. As I didn't have photos, I have no memory of how I looked when I was younger. That was the reason why I had to ask if the girl in that photo was me. It's ok. Well, what do you do? Film heroine... I'm trying for that role. Oh yeah. You are fond of acting since childhood, right? Yeah. What's the status of your trails? I am attending auditions. It's a very competitive industry. Let's see. Your work is really superb. There is a mysterious beauty in these photographs. It's because of special people like you. Thank you. -Wow! How many years has it been? -Eighteen years. Thanks. I will leave now. We met after a very long time. Let's have dinner first. And then, I will drop you. What do you say? -Umm... Some other time. -When? After another eighteen years? Oh! No... No... No... Okay, let's go. "My lips found a smile..." "...when they thought of you" "I have lost myself" "when I saw real you" "Every moment..." "I saw myself as your shadow" "And just like that, I left the ground under my feet" "and walked on dreams" "That eyebrow of yours is like a crescent moon" "These lovely little walks on the evenings and nights" "Have turned the trails into" "flowery paths in my story" "The oldest memory of my heart" "leaps with renewed colors" -"My fluttering heart recognized you and" -Let's take a selfie. "turned into a parrot and flies away with you" -Isn't that my name spelt in reverse? -"My fluttering heart recognized you and" "turned into a parrot and flies away with you" You are the reason I became a photographer. That's why I've named my company after you. "With you..." "With you..." "My lips found a smile" "when they thought of you" "I have lost myself," [splatter] "when I saw real you" "Every moment I saw myself "as your shadow" "And just like that, I left the ground under my feet" "and walked in the dreams" [indistinct vehicle moves] I'll be back in one hour. Can you hold these things, please... Okay. [phone rings] [phone rings] Varsha... your phone is ringing. Answer the phone and tell that I'll call back in half an hour. I love you. And I miss you so much. Who are you? Hello, who is this? Isn't Varsha there? She is at the beauty parlour. Who are you? It's okay. Tell her that her fiance called. And also, tell her that I miss her. They have shortlisted six of us out of the 25 who have attended. Six heroines in this film? -No! The director is going to take the audition of six of us and select. One chance... Just one chance... to prove myself. Varsha? Hmm... That's me. The director has selected you. Narayana, take that girl with you, fix her make-up, give her a costume And get her ready for the test shoot. Madam, this is your dress. Have you got any sense? How can give the heroine's costume to her body double? Sorry madam, the dress isn't ready yet. Since the director said it was urgent... Do you even know how much that dress costs? Can't you differentiate between the heroine and her body double... who gets paid on daily basis? Sorry, madam. If that heroine finds out, would she wear this dress ever again? -Go and get another dress. -Okay, madam. [weeps] [knocking on door] So, you don't want to work as a body double? Sorry, sir. I came here to bag the role of the heroine. Everyone comes to this industry to become heroes and heroines. Do you expect a warm welcome with a garland upon your arrival and be declared as a heroine? Do you think having just right skin tone and shape would fetch you the role? Why don't you go and take a good long look at yourself in the mirror? Do you even know what acting means? Acting doesn't just mean using your words to express the emotion. You must use your body as well. For example, anger. Anger springs from the heart... but that emotion should be expressed through your entire body. That is when you can charm people with your acting skill. -You are Rudramadevi. -What about you? I am... the enemy king who declared war on your kingdom. -What will you do? -Hmm... Why do you need this? Who wastes time talking to the enemy? Let's go to war. Ah... come on... Rudrama... [groans] -Hey... -[groans] Varsha... Varsha... Varsha... Varsha... Grandpa, get up. You acted really well, Grandpa... Let's start again, Grandpa. Get up... Grandpa... Grandpa... [weeps] Mom, ask Grandpa to get up. Grandpa is no more. He is right here, isn't he? Grandpa went to the Gods. I want my grandpa. -If not, I will go to Grandpa as well. -Oh no! You shouldn't talk like that. If you do what Grandpa loves, Grandpa will be with you always. You like acting, right Grandpa? When I grow up, I will become an actress and take up many roles just like you. That way you would always stay with me, right? Save water. Thanks. How come you are here? Stalking you! I want to abduct you. [scoffs] That will be of no use. I am pretty much useless to everybody and it's a huge waste of time. Who said that? Does it matter? I have been auditioning for three years. Nobody selected me. Some people don't want me to act. Some people don't like my action. And, I don't want to quit acting. If we get sad just because it is nightfall, we will miss out on the stars. If you are in grief because you have lost, you will miss success. It's that simple. It can be called as your failure only if you don't try, Someones's rejection has nothing to do with it. Your eyes are enough, Varsha... to know that you can act. One thing is for sure. The earth is round... and so every rejection that you faced, will be turned into a welcome. Trust me. [water dripping] Why did you ask me to come here? Look there. Congratulations, Varsha! Hey... How did you know? Your ad has gone viral on YouTube. Oh! -I saw your ad. It's really good. -Thank you, sir. Very expressive eyes and natural performance. Thank you, sir. I think you are the right fit for my script. If you are okay with it, my co-directors will fill you in on the dates. We can go for shoot in one week. I am in it, sir. Mahi... Mahi... I had never felt this excitement that I felt today to meet you, for any others. I got an offer as a heroine. Such a great piece of news with this low tone? You should be so loud that the entire city hears it. Shouts: Varsha has become a heroine! "La... La... La... My dream has come true..." "La... La... La... I'm here because of you..." Action! "So many rays of light for the eyes!" "So many prances from those smiling lips!" "A new me is born..." "...from my past" "Two different dreams, two different thoughts have met" "Two different hearts, two different bonds" "are sprinting together" "Two different dreams, two different thoughts have met" "Two different hearts, two different bonds are running about" "are sprinting together" "La... La... La... My dream has come true..." "La... La... La... I'm here because of you..." "Are those the stars that have caught the wings?" "Are those untangled calculations?" "I am like the night that has caught the moonlight. " "Every minute is changing as drastically" "as the seasons" "I walk beside you and ask my heart" "who else can be above you?'

[phone rings] Hello, sir. Congratulations, Varsha. What happened, sir? I just saw the first copy of our movie. It came out really well. Really, sir? Just mark my words. You will become a very top heroine. Thank you, sir. Thank you so much. [aeroplane whizzing] Today, I am so happy! Everyone who has seen the first copy said that the movie was a great hit. Congratulations! Thank you. From the next week, Varsha's time will start on the silver screen. I am going to be a big star. -And this is all because of you, Mahi! -This is all your talent. -Don't say you didn't do anything, Mahi. -What did I do? I was right here before you came. I had the same amount of talent before as well. I have been trying since three years. It's the same dog and pony show. It was of no use. I used to feel so disgusted to even look at the mirror after going back home. And everyone's words 'you are a failure' echoed in my mind in Dolby Atmos sound. I laughed and it immediately followed it with tears and vice versa. And I was constantly scared that if I stopped laughing, I would start crying. You came into my life... [imitates gunfire sound] And my life changed overnight. Varsha, the heroine! If you had come into my life earlier, I would have had this happiness much earlier. See, I didn't remember you... But you remembered me, right? Didn't you ever feel like searching for me? Didn't you ever want to meet me once again? Why didn't you come earlier, Mahi? You could have come for me. When we were young, you were with me and it made me happy. And now you are with me and once again, I am very happy. This equation is very simple. When you are beside me, I will be very happy. That's it! Will you stay with me? Will you stay with me all my life? Huh? Promise me. Promise me that you will stay with me my entire life. Varsha... Varsha... [pants] [pants heavily] [pants heavily] [coughs] [phone rings] Oh, crap! 37 missed calls Hello... -Where are you? -Geetha... It's getting late to the flight time. Come fast to the airport. Sorry... Sorry... Sorry... I will be there in fifteen minutes. -Fine. Just get here quickly. -Hmm. Hey Geeta... Did you get my luggage? -Yes, I did. -Thank God! Well... Listen... -Would it be late? -No... No... No delay. I will be there in fifteen minutes. -Yeah. Okay, bye. -Okay, bye Mahi... Mahi... Mahi... Why did you sleep here? Get up... Get up. Tsk! Hey Mahi, are you okay? Varsha is here. She slept here last night. What? Varsha? [phone rings] Mahi... Hello... We are calling from Nova Hospital... Is this Mahi? No, I am Mahi's friend. Please tell me. His medical reports have come. The doctor has asked him to get admitted in the hospital immediately. Admit? Why? What happened to Mahi? We don't know those details, sir. Please inform Mahi when you see him. Well... Hello... Hello. Hey, give me the phone. Varsha is not over upstairs. -Dialer tone: The number you're calling... -What's with getting admitted in hospital? Dialer tone: ...is not reachable at the moment. -Dialer tone: Please call back in sometime -Mahi? It says Varsha's phone to be not reachable. Hey! Why are you talking about Varsha when I was asking you about the hospital? What is happening to you? Nothing. It's a regular checkup. Mahi, you are hiding something from me. Tell me what happened. Please. We performed all the tests. Your son has a heart problem. Heart problem? The nerves of your son's heart are very weak. The medical terminology for this condition is Atrial fibrillation. The symptoms include breathlessness, chest pains, dizziness, fainting spells. It doesn't matter how much the medical expenses cost. I would even sell my photo studio. But please save him. There is no solution to this problem. All that can be done is taking precautions. How could you state such a huge problem in a simple manner? It's not worrisome because I didn't get this problem recently. This has been with me right from my childhood. The only thing that I have to do is go for my monthly checkups and take regular meditation. Nothing more. [message notification tone] I will visit the hospital now. Hi Mahi... When I came to see you, you were asleep. That's why, I didn't wake you up. I am going to Ooty... I wanted to tell this to you yesterday. But I forgot... I visit that place every year for my birthday. That's my custom. But for the first time, I will be having the feeling of missing you, even with everyone around me. It's okay. Now, I will go to Ooty and revisit those old places where we had our childhood memories. I will find you in these memories. But, if you were here, this trip would have become a life-long memory. Anyhow, bye. I'll be back soon. Mahi... Where are you going with that bag instead of going to the hospital? I am going to Ooty. Hey! The doctor insisted that you go to the hospital immediately. I get the same kind of call every time from the hospital. Nothing has happened so far. -Alright. But still... -Hey... It doesn't matter how I am. But as long as I am with Varsha, I will be happy. Buddy, just give it another thought. Please. She wants me to be with her. -Bye... -Hey... Hey... Hey... -Has Mahi arrived? -He is not responding, sir. I informed his friend. Do you have any idea about the patient's condition? When I told you that it is urgent, it means he is in danger. Call him immediately. [phone rings] Dialer tone: The number you are calling is busy. Please try later. [phone rings] Dialer tone: The number you are calling is switched off. What happened? His mobile is switched off. -Sir, anything serious. -Yes He is an Atrial fibrillation patient. Almost all of his heart vessels are blocked. His blood circulation is irregular as well. We need to start his treatment immediately. With each delay, his condition becomes even more critical. Anything can happen at any moment. Varsha, are you okay? Hmm. Hey! You also come. I will go. My mother must be waiting for me at home. Call me after you finish your works. We will meet in the evening. -Okay, bye. -Okay, bye. [music mutes voice] [music mutes voice] MAHI Madam, you are... Are you Varsha, the heroine? -Yes, I am. -Heroine Varsha has come. Come you guys, come. Madam, we have all seen you on YouTube. You are very beautiful, madam. -Madam, can we get a selfie, please? -Okay. [camera clicks] It seems like someone has planned by his actions. [ritualistic bell ringing] Mahi... Mahi... Mahi... Why would Mahi be here? -Are you mad? -Mahi. -Varsha. -Mahi. Mahi, I know that you are here. Mahi, come out. Varsha, Varsha... Varsha... Listen to me. Varsha. [honks] Varsha, watch out the jeep. I didn't think that you would come. You came without informing me. I was scared if it may take another 18 years to meet you again. Which is why, I came. I want to see Ooty with you. Hmm. I was confused when I woke up in the morning. I didn't have a clue where I was. I got clarity only after seeing you downstairs. The flight was already late, mobile was switched off and I wasn't ready. One after the other... [sighs] Don't you remember anything about what had happened last night? Uh-huh! Did I beat up someone? Did I trouble you a lot? Mahi. Tell me, what happened? It's nothing. You were unconscious while you were in a conversation at the party. I thought what people might think if I take you to your flat in that situation. So, I brought you home and made you sleep there. That's all. Mahi. Thank you. Have you lost in your thoughts? This village, the air over here and the sand smell... All my childhood memories are here. How pure were those days! It was all play in the day time and nights were only for sleep. "It's the same village" "The same stream" "It's the same excitement in the air" "We remain silent before we come together" "It's the same you and the same me" -That is my school. "But our story has changed" -Is it? What a coincidence! This is my school. -"We are like rivers..." -Really? "...that merge into the ocean" "These moments of naughtiness have turned into" " lasting memories" "It's an abode of friendship beyond worldly things" "Let's relive the springs of our past" "It's an abode of friendship beyond wordly things" "Let's relive the springs of our past" "When the rain drizzles on the tiny lives," "The surprised heart holds a lot of tunes" "Those old memories greeting us" "Our meetings have led to realising new shades" "Has that friendship come to you" "And changed into love?" "If that dream becomes true..." "...then our worlds get united" Right from my childhood, I held the desire to climb that mountain. But that never happened. [birds chirping] Let's climb now. Now? No. By the time we return, it will be night. Why should we return? Let's stay there tonight. -Are you crazy? -Why? Are you scared? Varsha and fear? You have hurt my ego. I will stay over the entire night. Let's see who gets there first. [chuckles] [panting] [chuckles] Come on. [panting] Mahi, what happened? Are you okay? Hey... Catch me if you can. This is cheating. Wow. What an amazing place! Mahi... Thank you, Mahi... [reverberates] Did you hear my friends thanking? We love you, Varsha madam... [reverberates] See, how many fans of yours are expressing their love for you. "It's the same childhood we shared as individuals" "The paths that brought us together..." -"...are the same" -Mahi, let's dance. Varsha, I don't know how to dance. Tsk! I am with you, aren't I? Anyways, it's your luck that the heroine wants to dance with you. Don't confuse. Look into my eyes. Enjoy the breeze and the music. Come. "Has that friendship come to you" "And changed into love?" "If that dream becomes true..." "...then our worlds get united" "It's an abode of friendship beyond worldly things" "Let's relive the springs of our past" What are you thinking? If we stay here forever, we can be happy forever by counting the stars! -You might get bored. -Tsk! I will never be bored with you. By the way, what are you thinking? I'm wondering what the future would be like. I will think about it when I get married and become a mother but not now. -How many children do you want? -Two. How many do you want? Even I want two kids. Where would you settle down? I am not particular. I have my Photo studio. I will take photographs and live my life. -What about you? -I will stay where my husband wants to. What else? Life gives surprises to everyone at a moment. They would be the happiest people ever if one can identify those. You are the surprise in my life, Varsha. If I had known that I would be with you in a place like this, I would have travelled hundreds of kilometers. Do you know something? Every time that my heartbeat so fast... everyone scares that something terrible would happen to me. But when you expressed your love for me, my heart pounded so fast like never before. I understood the very moment, Varsha. That nothing will happen to me if you are by my side. I love you Varsha. I thought of proposing the very next day I met you, But I stopped after knowing that there is someone else in your life. It's just me who stopped! Both my heart and thoughts are travelling with you. I am unable to stay away from you even after being with you. You don't remember what you've told me on that night. And you haven't listened to what I said tonight. That's probably how life works. [door bell rings] Coming... -Who rang the bell? -No one is here. [birds chirping] Mahi? What is this? You didn't even tell me that you were coming. I wanted to surprise you. Stop it. I'm feeling dizzy. Stop. Mahi... -How are you, my son? - I am doing good, mother. You might be hungry. Come on, eat breakfast. Your smile makes you look handsome. You should always keep smiling. [sighs] Varsha, cool. You should tell mother about Mahi at any cost. Wow, mother! The saree is awesome. -Do you like it? -Yeah. I made this specially for your wedding. It was delivered today. -Mother. -See. You've become so thin after dieting so much. It's nice. Mother, what is the need of all these things now? When your father, who I loved so dearly, suddenly betrayed us and abandoned us, everyone pitied me. That is when I decided that I should bring you up very well and marry you off to a very nice guy. Mother, please. Varsha, Rahul isn't like your father. He has been waiting for you for three years. Isn't that enough... ...to know that he would never let you go if he holds your hand? Are you going to invite your father to the wedding? -Mom... -Don't invite him. I don't like to see him. I saw dad with another girl today. Dad hugged her. I got angry after seeing that. [thundering] How dare you question me all because she scribbled some nonsense? She write out of imagination. Or it isn't some nonsense either. She only wrote what she saw. -You are the one who betrayed. -Hey! -Why did you do so? -I will live the way that I want. There would be no relation to us from now. -Mind your bloody lives! -[groans] Do you think we cannot survive without you? Get lost. Mother. Don't cry, mother. Please mother, don't cry. I am there for you. Please, mother. [breathes heavily] [breathes heavily] In unison: Happy birthday to you... Every year it was my daughter who comes home. Now, it's a heroine. Happy Birthday! May you live a long-life, son. Tsk! I don't know what to do. I don't know how to convince my mother. And I don't know how to convey this to Rahul and when to tell this to Mahi. Don't worry so much about what they want. What is it that you want? Rahul has been waiting for me for the past three years. But now, if I tell him that I don't like him any more and that I no longer have feelings for him, isn't that betrayal? If that's the case, having Mahi in your heart and getting married to Rahul, what do you think that's called? Because of your father's betrayal, your mother is still suffering the consequences Don't repeat the same mistake. Even if you get married to Rahul and stay with him for a hundred years, you will not be able to make him happy for even a moment. And you will not be happy either. -Hello, Murthy sir. -Hello, sir. Come in. Please take a seat. Did you know that Rangarao sir is dead? Mr. Rangarao? The one who is a stage artist and stays in Gandhinagar. Hmm. He doesn't have any relatives here. That's why they are taking his dead body to their hometown. Oh no! Hey, where are you going? Mahi, don't run. Wait. Hey, Mahi. Mahi... I'll keep my favourite things in this box. This is my treasure box. [phone rings] -Tell me, Geeta. -Mahi, where are you? -I am in the studio. -You haven't started yet, did you? Uh-huh! Which pub is it? Sound and spirits. Both of us will be there in half an hour. You join us there. Hi, Varsha. Happy birthday. Thank you, sir. We would have had a grand celebration for your birthday if you were here. But, we missed it. But tomorrow, you shouldn't miss our movie's premiere show at any cost. Oh! Okay? Yeah, sir. I'll be there. Bye... Bye... Thank you, sir. Bye. [laughs] [phone ringing] You carry on. I'll join you. Hi, Rahul. -Happy birthday, Varsha.-Thanks. I am sorry that I've called you lately. I've severe workload. It's okay. [singing Bollywood song] We both learned guitar together. -He is my best friend. -Is it so? What is it, Varsha? You seem very distant. There is nothing as such. I came out with my friends as it's my birthday. Everyone is waiting for me. -So... -Oh! Okay, no problem. Have a great time, okay? Bye... Bye... Thanks... [applauding] It's okay. -Hey! Who is he? -They both are friends it seems. What I feel today... dates back to our student days. It's been years since I held a guitar. And it's been years since I met him. And most importantly, I met my childhood friend who gave many unforgettable memories in my life, after eighteen years. Happy birthday Varsha. Thank you. You are really special. This one is for you. "It's you... You are my companion" "We both have a story" "And it's called as love" "All my hopes and attention of the recent past..." "...I've been carrying them in my heart, do you know that?" "I wrote many words" "Looked towards you silently and hid them deep inside me" "You are my heartbeat..." "You are my heartbeat..." "You are my heartbeat..." "You are my heartbeat..." "You are my heartbeat..." "You are my heartbeat..." "Knowing that you are the outcome for many of my dreams" "my heart overflows with joy" "If you ask me who am I?" "Then I'll show you that it's you" "Even if the distance alienate us" "I have hidden you deep inside my heart" "To make me see you with my soul..." "You have put yourself in my eyelids" "You are my heartbeat..." "You are my heartbeat..." "You are my heartbeat..." "Like a small breeze that touched you" "has reached me as my life-breath" "You've shared every word on your lip..." "...to me in the form of love" "I cannot live without you" "I swear on your love, I will remain forever" "A world without you is emptiness" "I got no meaning without you" "You are my heartbeat..." "You are my heartbeat..." "You are my heartbeat..." "You are my heartbeat..." "You are my heartbeat..." "You are my heartbeat..." -Shall we sit here? -Yeah! [cicadas critter] I was apparently in an accident right before birth. And because of that my mother's amniotic fluid broke and she was immediately operated for delivery. That is when the doctors found out that, the umbilical cord was tied around my neck and acted like a hanging rope. If I hadn't been in that accident, I wouldn't have been born. I would have died in the womb. I keep remembering this on my every birthday. God gave me a second life even before I was born, so there must be a certain purpose for my life. That is the reason that drives me to achieve some form of success in life. I have become a little melodramatic. Sorry. It's okay. Friends are there for a reason to share. Right from sharing a room rent to sharing this kind of melodrama. When is your birthday? It's already past twelve, right? It was yesterday. -Yesterday? -Yeah. -Really? -Yes. Unbelievable. What a coincidence! Yeah! -Happy birthday. -Happy birthday to both of us. Mahi, why didn't you tell me this before? Your birthday seemed more important to me than mine. I wanted you to have all the attention. I didn't want even a tiny bit of attention taken away from you. That is why... Thanks. Where were you all these years, Varsha? I have to give you something. Come. -What is it? -Surprise. Why don't you tell me? Can't you come with me? Hmm. I sat here, didn't I? My grandfather sat there. And your father sat here, taking my photo. And you dlipped the lunch box there. Father... [gasps] [lunch box clunks] I saw you and laughed. Close your eyes. Huh? -Just close your eyes. -Hmm. I was sure you would come here one day and that's why I preserved it. [phone ringing] Hello, Varsha. Good morning. Did I disturb you? I will call you in ten minutes, Rahul. Okay. Take your time. Hello, Varsha...Do you know where I am right now? Where are you? 2,240 metres above the sea level. I'm at a place where there is a beautiful tea estate and my most beautiful Varsha. Did you come to Ooty? Yeah, surprise. I really missed you. I wanted to see you. Come soon. Mahi. I am going to take a very important decision. I have to go. Take care. [coughs] -Are you okay? -Yeah! [coughs] It's been so long since I saw you, Varsha. I missed you so much. I can't stay away from you anymore. Anyways, you have attained your goal. It makes no sense to waste any more time. Rahul, I have to tell you something. One minute. Will you marry me? I am talking to you. Will you marry me? Sorry, Rahul. I can't marry you. Are you joking? Uh-uh! I'm serious. What do you mean by that? I am in love with someone else. Don't be ridiculous. I don't believe you, Varsha. I know that you like me. It's the truth even if you believe it or not. Where did I go wrong, Varsha? I waited for you. I supported you when you were struggling. I stood by you even when my parents opposed our love. When I said I don't have feelings for you, I didn't mean that I don't like you. I mean I don't have enough feelings for you to continue my life's journey. Who is he? It's not necessary now. Give me one good reason for rejecting me but not for accepting him. We have met a lot of time in these three years, isn't it, Rahul? Tell me one memory that really stands out to you. Tell me one memory that made you want to cherish it for a lifetime? Tell me one memory where you felt beautiful to have me around. Did he give you that many memories? Mind your language, Rahul. Never mind me. Tell me. I can take it. That's it... That's it. Love will not survive in a place where you cannot express your likes and dislikes. Varsha... I am sorry. Varsha... Varsha please... I am sorry. Give me one more chance. -Please. -It's too late, Rahul. I am sorry. Tsk! [traffic] You are in a helpless situation Mahi. I have checked all the test reports conducted at Hyderabad recently. For the past five to six months, your condition has taken a turn for the worse. [phone ringing] It's okay. Attend the call if it's urgent. No, doctor. From the past week, you have slipped into a very dangerous condition. We have to start your treatment immediately. I need some time, doctor. If you delay it further... I am sorry. Hello. Did you start? No, not yet. Geeta, Mahi isn't answering my phone. I can't imagine watching the premiere show without him. He must be busy. He will call you back. No, find out his address. Let's meet up, go to him and remind him about the premier show. -I will see you there. Okay, bye. -Bye. Mother, I will pick up Geeta and come directly to the airport. -You come there directly. Okay? -Don't worry. She will come. Let it be, sister. She said she will come with her friend, didn't she? You always agree with what she says. Come back on time, dear. We will miss the premier show if we miss the flight. -Thank you, uncle. -Bye, mother. Bye. -Bye. -Come soon. This is the address given by Mahi's friend. -Just go and come back soon. -Hmm. -Don't be late. -Okay. [door bell ringing] -Hi, Aunty. -Who are you? Aunty, my name is Varsha. I am Mahi's friend. -Come inside. -Thanks, Aunty. Aunty, isn't Mahi around? Mahi has gone to his father's photo studio. I have been waiting for him as well. He isn't picking up his calls. Just take a seat. -I will get you some water. -Okay, Aunty. Here. Aunty, that photo... That was the first photo of Mahi, taken by his father. Who is the other one in that photo? That girl and Mahi were born at the same time in the hospital. Do you know them? No, I don't know. Aunty, the girl in that photo is me. Aren't you believing it, Aunty? Uncle was the one that caused the accident to our car, right? Hmm. And that is when my mother went into labour, didn't she? Hmm, yeah! So, are you that girl? I will immediately call Mahi and tell this to him. Please, Aunty... I will tell to Mahi. I will surprise him. Please Aunty, don't tell him. -Alright. -Promise me. I won't tell. Geetha, I am so happy. -Varsha, it's getting late. Come fast. -Hmm. Mahi... Mahi... Mahi... Mahi... Open the door. Mahi, I have to tell you something important. Open the door. [door knocking] Tsk! [phone rings] [dials] -The person you are dialing... -Come on, Mahi. Pick up the phone. Varsha, we'll miss the flight. Come. Just wait. Where did he go? Even his jeep is here. [door knocking] Mahi... -Varsha... -Mahi, open the door. Mahi may not be there inside. Where might have he gone? He must be in the middle of something important. -He will call you later. -It's not that. Please wait for some time. He said he would come to the preview show, didn't he? -Mahi... -Come, let's go. How can we go without him? -He will call you. Come, Varsha... -Mahi... I don't know what to do. How do I break this news to her? Can she bear the fact that I'm going to die? I made a huge mistake by entering into her life. How can loving someone be wrong? Nothing will happen to you. Come to Hyderabad immediately. Let's get you admitted into a very good hospital. I am not confident that I would come out alive if I admit into a hospital. Neither the doctors nor the medicines can lengthen my life-span. Hey! Stop talking that way. Ever since I was a kid, I have always liked her a lot. I wanted to spend my entire life with her. Hey Sanjay... I... I want to live. Hey! Nothing will happen to you. Don't get tensed. I'll come there. Bye. [no audio] [camera captures] Varsha madam, can I take a selfie, please? Yeah! -Thank you. -Welcome. Sit this side. OKARI KOSAM OKARU (Being there for each other) -Switch off the mobile and watch the film. -Mom... please... -Just two seconds... -Give it here. [aeroplane whooshing] Hello. Mahi, have you landed? I am sorry, buddy. I was delayed because of the traffic. I will be there in another fifteen minutes. I am already in the cab. I am going to premiere show. What do you think you are doing even after knowing your condition? How can you be so careless even at this time? I promised Varsha that I would attend the premiere show. I'll meet her and tell her the truth and come to you. Hey! Just do what I ask you to. Just go directly to the hospital. I will tell her the truth. In love, hiding the truth is as similar to lying. She shouldn't mistake my love for her as a lie. If I go to the hospital, I don't know if I will ever see her again. I will go and meet her once. Mahi, she doesn't mind all that... Hello... Hello... [thundering] [coughs] You are important in my life. But I'll be happy if you are beside me. Where are you? I'm searching for you though they are looking at me. You should see the happiness in my eyes while everyone is appreciating me. Please, come. [cough] No, Rajesh. You need a person to love and while I need a soul. You need marriage to stay together while I want love. Life doesn't meant to earn money but to gather memories. Is it fair to stay with you while I have my memories with him? Or do you want me to get marry to a boy of my parent's choice? Then I'll give my life to you and my love to him. Rajesh, it seems like a old saying. Though I'm saying it. My life and death are with him. My heart belongs to him. There is no change in this decision and no one can change it. We both know why you came. You've put the television on mute and... [coughs] [thundering] Hello, Mahi... Mahi... Can you hear me? Mahi... Mahi... Hello... Hello, Mahi... Mahi... Hey! Hello mister! Hey, come here. Hold him. Careful. Drive fast. Hello. Hello, Mahi. Mahi is unconscious here. He is not in a position to speak. Oh, my God! He is a heart patient. Bring him to Nova hospital immediately. Driver, drive to Nova hospital. [applauding] Mother, give me the phone. -Did Mahi call you? -No, he didn't. I need to speak to him urgently. Call him. Okay. -Mahi is here. -Varsha... -Congratulation. -Thank you. -Congrats. -Thanks. [phone ringing] Hello. Hello, Mahi... Mahi, where are you? Mahi... Hello... Varsha! Rahul, how is it that you are here? Where is Mahi? Mahi fainted in front of the premiere theatre. His condition is critical. I am taking him to the Nova Hospital. Varsha... Hello, Varsha... Driver... [music mutes audio] Sister... Yes, sir. This is his mobile. [device beeping] [collision] [groans] [glass shatters] [groans] [ambulance siren] Oh no! Where is it? There is the ICU. -Don't worry. -What happened to my daughter? -Did the doctors say anything? -Nurse. Madam, the patient is inside and is undergoing treatment. Doctor will come and talk to you. -How is she? -Please, don't worry. -What happened to her? -Just wait for ten minutes. [device beeping] -Doctor. -There is no hope. Heart transplantation is the only option left to save him. We are trying our best to find him a suitable heart. Are you Varsha's relatives? Yes, sir. We are Varsha's relatives. -You are...? -Mother. The brain scanning reports have come. But she isn't responding to the tests. Unfortunately, it's a brain death. Oh no! Oh God...! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! I am sorry. Oh no! My daughter! My daughter! [music mutes voice] Madam, this is the organ donation form. If you sign here... -Mr. Sanjay. -Yes, doctor. We are so lucky. We have found a suitable heart for the Mahi's heart transplantation. Thank you. Thank you, doctor. Thank you, doctor. "After an array of disturbed dreams," "has your story come to an end like this?" "Has your heart consider this..." "...as a ultimate boon?" "And in that way, has the memory of the heart," "given you a complete life?" "In this way, did your love..." "... win over your death?" Mahi, nothing will happen to you. I am here. I told you that my life had some purpose. Did you see? Maybe it's this. Isn't it a beautiful ending? I'm in you and you are with me. Distance fled away from us out of fear of our love. Your breathe is touching me. And you hear my heartbeat. With the inseparable love, we are closer than possible. And now, our world is the same.
