(eerie music) (hiss) (melodious, haunting music) - How's the second floor? - Everyone's asleep. Just another quiet night. (distant shriek) (rasping) What the hell? - I'll check outside. - I'll check the second floor. (water drips) (bestial moan) (low groan) (low rumble) (discordant music) - Who is that? (low rumble) (dramatic music) (choking) (growling and snorting) (squishing and tearing) (cackle) (bestial moan) (shriek) (ripping and growling) - What the hell is that? (roar) (growl) (scream) (crunch) (high-pitched keening) (distant screams and growls) (ominous music) - [Gruff Voice] From hell it came, born from darkness by the Old Ones, before the time of man. It is a traveler between the realms of this world and the next, used to protect the secrets of the Five that are One, the Lords of Darkness and Evil. The creature was first summoned by alchemists searching for these arcane secrets. They were unaware of the toll that they would have to pay. Those who call the beast must make an offering to it, five lives to appease its masters. Only then will it return to the shadowy world from which it came. The abomination can be controlled by the one who summoned it, only if he can bestow the mark of the beast to the five chosen. (primal shriek) For them, there is no salvation, for he who hears the creature's bloodcurdling shriek is doomed. (primal shriek) - [Zak] So, do you have a major? I mean, I know you can't pick one officially yet, but do you have one? - [Clark] Yeah. - [Zak] It's not something pointless like media studies or education, is it? - [Clark] No it's, it's math. - [Zak] You're a math major? - Yeah, and I've never even owned a pocket protector. - I don't believe all those cliches about math majors. - Yes you do. (laughs) - Okay, I do, but I'm working really hard not to. - Oh. - No glasses, huh? - No, better than 20/20 vision. Look... - Zak. - Zak, I appreciate you trying to be roommates or whatever-- - Oh, it's my pleasure. I was in the same bind when I was a freshman. - What I really need to know though is what it's gonna cost, because money-wise-- - It's free. - It's free? - And then again, it isn't. It's great housing for free, but you can never tell anybody about it, you can never give anyone your address, you can never bring anybody by there, all your mail goes to a P.O. box, no calls except through a cell phone. Now those are the absolute rules of the house. - Okay, I get it. You're squatting. - Some might call it that. - Well, what is it, and old house or a building? What? It's a hospital? - It's been empty for something like 50 years. The county owns it. It beats sleeping in the park. We took off their key and padlock and put on our own. You have to keep it locked at all times. We don't want anyone coming back and finding the gate open. Here, I made you a copy today. Your key to the merry kingdom. (Clark laughs) Come on. Hey look, everybody's here. - Hi. - Hey. - Okay, Clark, this is David. He started it all. He was here first. - David. - Clark, huh? - Yeah, it was my mother's family name. It's a Protestant thing. (Elaine chuckles) - David's in pre-law. Mike over here is in mechanical engineering, so whatever water and power we have, he's the man. - I'm not gay. - I'm sorry? - Just 'cause I have short hair and a great body, I don't want you to think I'm gay. - Okay. - I mean, I've slept with 17 different women, and not one of 'em was a man. - Fine. - I've got a girlfriend, two girlfriends. I'm obsessive compulsive, but I'm not gay. - This is Tanya. - Comrade. - I beg your pardon? - Tanya's not her real name. What is it, Tammy or something? She's into this whole anachronistic Red Army thing. - What David doesn't realize is when the revolution comes, the lawyers are gonna be first up against the wall. - I'm telling you, you need a beret. It'll make the whole image complete. - Keep laughing. Are you taking any poli sci courses? - No, not really. - Um, this is Elaine. - Hi. - Hi. - [Zak] She's a bit quiet. She's in pre-med. - So, what's the procedure? - Turn around. Any vetoes? You're in. Let's go. We've all staked out rooms on the second floor. - Why the second? - Well as you can see, the first floor's full of junk. There's some furniture in the basement if you want to look around down there. Do you have a thing about rats? - Um, yeah. - Then you might not want to go down to the basement. - Don't worry. Every Thursday's big garbage day. That's when people throw out their furniture. - A few rules. We got the windows on two blacked out. You can't have any light anywhere in the building where it could be seen from the outside. There's no smoking, no visitors. An open secret is no secret. You want to sleep with a guy, you go to his place. - So we're the only ones in the hospital? - Just us six. Nobody else lives here. Nobody else even knows we're here, and that's the way we want it. They had a kitchen back in the nurse's station. Electric range. You want to use it, you clean it up. These are all the old semi-private rooms up here. Zak's there, Tanya, Elaine, Mike. That side's ward B over there, and that's where I live. - You have a whole ward? - I've got a lot of stuff. I was also here first. You want a ward? There are four of them in the hospital, as well as three buildings in the compound. You clean one out, you can have one to yourself too. You can live anywhere you want. It's up to you. Lock your space up, don't, that's also up to you. Tanya here likes to keep her space locked. - So do you. - Yeah, but I believe in private property. - Then you shouldn't be living in someone else's building. These guys don't want to admit it, but this, this is communal living. - Yeah. Oh yeah. - This is urban pioneering, and we're staking out unwanted territory that's going to waste. - Actually, I think this is just a bunch of college kids who need a cheap place to live. (Clark laughs) Pick a room. - I'll take it. - [Zak] Clark, you realize you picked the best room in the house. (water dripping) I really hope that you like it. Seriously, it's so much better than living in a dorm. (distance obscures Zak's voice) (rattling) (eerie music) (shrieking) (bestial moan) (shriek) (bestial moan) (exerted breathing) - God, are you okay? - Yeah. - Do you want some water or something? - Yeah. - Here. - Thank you. Oof! - Look, um, Zak I really appreciate the help you've been giving me. - That's okay, but this is the last of it, right? - Yeah. - Okay. (laughs) Oof. - What do you think? - It's awesome. - Yeah. - Hey uh, do you want to go celebrate? You know, get a cocktail or something? - Oh-- - I mean, I have to catch my breath first. - Yeah. Well actually um, well I have some work I should do around here, and I actually, I should study, so-- - Oh hey, no problem. I'll um, I'll see you around. - But, but... Well Zak, I just meant not tonight. I mean, maybe later-- - Hi there. Oh, I'm sorry. - Did you see Zak? - Yeah, I think he just headed down the hall. Anyway, look. No pressure or anything. - What? - But these are some pamphlets, all right? Students For a Better World. - Oh. - And The Truth About Socialism. Now you don't have to read them, but if you do, and you want to talk. - Thanks. - We have meetings every Tuesdays and Thursdays, and if you'd like to come-- - Communism is dead! - Go tell that to Two Bang Red Chinese! Fuck off. So, if you want to just come hang out some night, we'd really like you to be there. It's not like a high pressure kind of thing, all right? - I'll look at them if I get a chance, okay? - Oh that's great! - Yeah. - That's great, all right! - Okay. - Okay, so, no hard sell or anything like that. - No, okay. - All right, okay, I'll talk to you later! - All right, great. (eerie music) (water dripping) (rasping) (distant groan) What the... (hiss) (soft rattle) (soft rattle) (distant shriek) Where's it coming from? (water drips) (distant scraping) (water spraying) (groaning) (water dripping) (distant scraping) (distant scraping) (soft rattle) (soft rattle) (soft rattle) (gasp) Who are you? (clapping) - Clapper. - What? - I got the lights rigged to a Clapper. Clap twice, they go on. Clap twice, and they go off. - What are you doing here? - I live here. You must be Clark. - How, how do you know my name? - The elevator shaft. You listen close, and you can hear what people are saying in some of the hallways and the rooms. - You're not supposed to be here without permission. - Whose permission? - Our permission, the permission of the people who live here. - Who gave them permission? Who gave you permission? - I was here before any of you. - And you've been down here this whole time and nobody ever found you? - I'm a quiet person. People don't come down here very often. And when they do, I hide. - Why didn't you hide just now? - My motives are varied and often obscure. So why are you here? - How do you mean? I'm in the basement because I smelled smoke. Somebody's been messing around up there. There were these marks on the ground and the center part was burning. I don't suppose you know anything about it. - That means you do suppose I know something about it. - Do you? - I didn't do it, if that's what you're asking. - Well, I'm in this building because I can't afford any place else to live. I'm at the university because I want to study math. As to why I'm here on earth, to learn maybe. - So you're here on earth to learn, huh? - I suppose. Good a reason as any. - You know what my father used to say? He said that fear is the place you go to learn. - I don't believe that. - I didn't for a long time either, but I'm starting to. I think what he meant to say is that fear is the place where you go to learn about yourself. - [Clark] What's this? - Actually, I'm not 100% sure. Somebody did this when I was out. And I do go out you know. I think it's some sort of an experiment, not a completely successful one. - What kind of experiment? These are just like the ones in the alley and the center part was burning. - Just like it? - No. These are smaller. What kind of experiment? - You see these marks? They're apostolic symbols, an old ancient script from around the first century. - So this is some sort of an occult thing? - Nobody's ever been able to translate them before. They say that that's because these symbols aren't a language at all, but they're actually equations. - That's an interesting coincidence. Somebody just happens to put these things down here and you just happen to know everything about them, but you didn't do it. - I'm a collector of facts. Facts are overrated, of course, just raw material until you organize them into theories. These aren't the first ones that I've found here. There's a few other on the far wall there. But this is the first one that resulted in a ignition. - But what's it for? - It may be some kind of lightning rod, or somebody wants it to be. - What kind of lightning? What are these? - Texts of apostolic symbols. Also some notes that I wrote. I've been trying to decode them, but I haven't had much luck. Did anyone ever tell you about the Shrieker? Someone has been messing around with some arcane stuff, which normally wouldn't matter because 99% of the occult is bullshit, and none of the people studying it are smart enough to recognize, never mind figure out the 1% that isn't. Somebody in this place has stumbled onto something. They're experimenting, and they're getting close. - To drawing lightning? - Find out about the Shrieker. - [Clark] What's the Shrieker? - What you need to know you can find out in the library. - Under what, occult studies, mythology, folklore? - Local history. - Local, you mean the town, the university? - I'm talking about this building. - I won't tell anybody you're here if you don't want me to. - I don't. Thanks. Hey. You should do something about that cut. On your back. - Oh. Thanks. So, um, what's the average yearly rainfall in Athens? (soft chuckle) - 15.8 inches a year. - What about Lima? - 1.6. (laughing) - [Zak] Jesus Christ. You could have been killed down there. - Hm? Okay. - Is it serious? - No. - What are you looking up? - Average yearly rainfall. Athens, 15.8. Lima, 1.6. Damn. - Is this a problem? - Hm? - Well, the burn in the alley's definitely cold. - Yeah, I'm gonna install some smoke detectors down there just to be on the safe side. You guys'll buy 'em, and I'll install 'em. - All right, listen up. I've chained up the door down to the basement. Whichever one of you was fucking around in there with that voodoo bullshit in the alley, there better not be a repeat, or somebody's gonna get their ass kicked out of here. - David, maybe it wasn't one of us. Maybe it was someone else, someone from the outside. - There isn't any other way into the compound without the keys, unless somebody around here gave copies to somebody. So it's one of us. I'm not gonna make some kind of issue out of it. Far be it from me to point the finger of guilt. This time. - Feel better. - Thanks. (Mike sighs) - Last booster shot? - Uh... Six months ago. - Okay. Done. - Thanks. - Do you want any painkillers? - No, I'm all right. - [Elaine] Bye. - Bye. (staticky grunge music) He thinks I did it. - Hm? - David. He thinks I did that thing in the alley. - Well, he's got no reason. You can just-- - No, it makes perfect sense. I mean, I'm new here and none of you really know me, and I was there. But I didn't do it. - I believe you. Well, I better go too. - No, no, you don't, you don't have to go. Do you, um, do you believe that fear is the place that you go to learn? I mean, when you confront your fear, do you think that you can turn it into wisdom? - I'd love to be able to respond appropriately, but I've got to be honest. I'm clueless. Appropriate response. (laughs) (dial-up beeping) (beep) (screech) (ominous music) - The Shrieker. (haunting choral music) (keystrokes) No, you're all wrong. (crickets chirp) (distant groans) (roar) (dramatic music) (hiss) - I think the building's on fire. - [Tanya] Can we turn on the lights? (clank) (coughing) - [Clark] Who the hell did this? - [Zak] All right, let's search the compound. (suspenseful music) (Elaine gasps) - Chain's still on the front gate. (exerted breathing) Gate's still locked. - Big surprise. - What's that supposed to mean? - I don't know what kind of Halloween bullshit you're pulling here, but I want you out of here. - Hey, who the hell put you in charge? - I was here first. I found this place. I staked it out. I'm trying to preserve it. You know Zak, you ought to try to think with your head instead of your dick. - Hey, fuck you. - You think I don't know what this is about? This is like some kinda fucked up Scooby-Doo episode. You're trying to scare us out. Maybe you and Zak worked the whole thing together. What's the matter, you want the whole fucking hospital for yourselves? - Fine, I'll leave. I'll find someplace else to stay. - No, no, you don't have to go anywhere. David is not the landlord around here. He is just a squatter like the rest of us. You don't give anybody orders! - Yeah, well you can get out too, Miss Daily Worker. You know something, comrade Tanya? You want to go help the workers, go fuck one. - All right, come on, come on, come on. - What's the title on your party anyway? Fag hag? - Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. What's that supposed to mean? - When was the last time you fucked someone without the express intention of trying to change his political views? - Fine, I'll leave! Anybody who does not wish to remain in the company of this oppressive fuckhead can come with me. - Didn't something like this happen in Reds? - All right guys, look. If we let this turn into open warfare, everything we've got going here's just gonna go up in smoke. - How ironically apt an analogy. I'm telling you guys, somebody isn't what they seem, and unless we rid ourselves of that person, or persons, there isn't going to be any peace around here. - What about the scream? What made the scream? I mean it wasn't human. Doesn't this bother anybody? - You said you're gonna go when? - No, I changed my mind. I'm not going anywhere. I'm gonna find out what's going on here. Unless you plan on kicking me out. - No, he isn't. - Oh really? Why not? - Because if you do I'll rat this whole thing out, and then we'll all be on the street. - That's great. Fucking great. Fucking surprise. - Hey, is Zak around? - No, it's just us. - Do you need help with that? - No thanks. You know Clark, if we would work together, we could really change some things around this place. - Look, Tanya, I think some really dangerous things are going on around here. - Tell me about it. You think I don't recognize the tactics of oppression? You need to wake up, Clark. The only safety is in sisterhood united under the banner of communism. Think about it. (Clark sighs) (crickets chirp) (ominous music) (guttural rasping) (snorting) (metallic thud) (clanging) - Hello? (snorting) Hey. Hey. (groan) (electric buzz) (shrieking) (hiss) (hiss) (hiss) (growl) (clink) (shriek) (shriek) (shrieking) (screaming) (distant shrieking) - What is it? - [Clark] I don't know. (distant shrieking) (moan) - Where is it? Where is it coming from? - [Clark] I don't know. I can't tell. Come on. - No, no. - Wait, Tanya, just stay here and be quiet and I'll go check outside. - No no, stay here! I mean, what are you gonna go do if you find it? What? Just, you stay here and just be quiet. - I think it's gone. - Back from Siberia? (knocking) - Heard any weird sounds tonight? - No, why? - (scoffs) Yeah right. (knocking) (Tanya sighs) Have you seen Mike around? He told me he'd turn the power on in my building. - I haven't seen him. Make sure you black out all the windows before you turn on any lights. - Don't think I don't know what you're doing. (door shuts) (knock) - Hold on. Come in. - Hey, how you doing? - Oh, hey. - Just wondering if you want some company. - Um, sure. Come in. - So, what are you working on? - This, oh. Well actually it's multidimensional topography. You see, it can describe a fourth dimensional object by-- - Please stop, oh. I'm sorry. It's just not my area. - Okay. - Look, I just want you to know that whatever's going on around here, I think David is way out of line. - Thanks. (phone rings) Hello? - It's Robert. - [Clark] Oh, hi. - [Robert] I've been hearing some weird noises lately. Last night and again this evening. Was I dreaming? - No, you weren't. - Well I guess the latest experiments were more successful than the previous ones. Have you had a chance to look at the notes I gave you? - Yeah, I was just... Hold on. Zak, actually this is a private call. Do you mind? - Oh no, no. Do you need these? - Oh yeah. Thanks. - See you later. - Okay, I've been looking over your notes and you're completely wrong. - Well that's progress at least. Why am I wrong? - You've been treating these symbols as if they were mathematical terms, but they're not. - Then what are they? - They're cross sections. Look, can I come down and see you? I have some things I want to show you. - I'm here. Come around the back. It's unlocked. - Right, right. (beep) - Hey. - Sorry, I gotta go. - At 11:30 at night? - School thing. See, the even symbols are two-dimensional cross sections of a three-dimensional shape. The odd symbols define the angle of a cross section. Watch. - This is what I think. There are higher dimensions, and things live in them. Sometimes there's weak spots between the higher ones and our own where they can break through, and I think sometimes these breakthroughs must happen spontaneously. Not often but, there have been other cases. - Like lightning. - That's right. And if you wanted to draw lightning on purpose, where would you go? Someplace you knew lightning had already struck on its own. - Maybe. But you wouldn't just go on a mountainside holding a lightning rod, would you? Whoever's doing this knows about the Shrieker. They know what it did. They wouldn't just conjure it up unless they had a death wish. - Not unless you had some means of controlling it, directing it. - You know, just listening to it, I'm scared to death. - Did you learn anything? - No, I was too petrified to think. - The problem was that you didn't go to it. You didn't face it. That's why you didn't learn anything. - Okay, I have to be honest with you. That sounds like a monumentally bad piece of advice. - Sometimes lies are more agreeable than the truth. Which do you prefer? - The truth. - What do you make of those? - Nothing yet. They're different than the others. - The mark of sending. You use this symbol to kill. Draw it on a piece of paper and hand it to a prospective victim. Once they've received it, they can only get rid of it by giving it to somebody else. Tearing it up and throwing it away won't work. The mark of binding. Once you have derived or invoked the demon, this symbol, this shape, makes it your slave in theory, but that symbol only works after you've given it to five victims. - You knew what these symbols meant all along? Those notes you gave me, they were bullshit. You knew what these meant. - Do you believe in it? - What? - Do you believe in it? - What? - Say it. Tell me that you believe that it's real. - I believe that it's real. - I think Mike is dead. He was the first victim and four other are gonna die too if this thing isn't stopped. And to be honest with you, I don't think this thing can be stopped. You've got a decision to make here. That door over there, it leads to the outside. You can go and you don't have to come back. - What about the others? - They won't believe you. And they're certainly not gonna believe me. - God Zak, I've got to talk to you. - We wanted to talk to you, Clark. - We? - Come on. - Have a seat, Clark. - To what do I owe the pleasure? That was in my room. - Well now it's in here. - You had no right. - We all have the right to self-protection. - Look, I was gonna tell you about this, okay? I didn't do those drawings. I got them from Robert. - Who's Robert? - Robert lives in the basement. He's been down there-- - Bullshit. There isn't anybody in the basement. I've been down there 20 times. - Oh really? And what were you doing down there all those times? - No no. Don't you try to turn this around. There's no bogeyman in the basement. There's just you. - No, I didn't. Zak? - You were hiding this stuff in your room. What do you want me to think? - I wasn't hiding. - Yes you were. I saw the way you closed that notebook when I came in the room. Don't tell me that. - Look Zak, you've gotta trust me. - No. You don't have the right to use me and lie to me and then ask me to trust you. - Okay, I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the drawings, but I never used you. - How can I believe you? - I don't know how, but you've gotta try, okay? Look, I think we're all in real danger here. Honest to God, I think Mike is dead. - Why? Because he hasn't come home? You know, he wasn't lying you know. He really does have two girlfriends and this whole gender thing he's always gotta constantly prove, him not being here isn't so unusual. - 50 years ago something happened here. Seven people were killed by something. - Yeah, probably by poor medical care. - Christ, don't you think I know how ridiculous this sounds? - Good, then we're in agreement on something. - Don't you see I'm trying to warn you? I'm trying to save your lives. - Go on, Clark. You want to tell us something, go ahead and tell us. - It isn't a joke. The newspapers reported it. They called it the Shrieker, and I believe that it came through here last night, right through that door. - Then why didn't anybody see it? - I don't know. It may be able to make itself invisible or move through solid matter. - Well that would explain it. (water dripping) - And this Robert, he told you about these, uh-- - Apostolic symbols. - And you believed him. - Yes. - Did you ever think he's the one who's doing this? - There's no way. With the first floor door locked off, the only way out of the basement is through a door to the outside, and the only way back in and up the stairs is through a side entrance that's been chained shut. - This is ridiculous. Who even says there is a Robert? - Well hell, that's easy enough to test. Either he's there or he isn't. Why don't we go check? Prove that much of the story anyway. - That's fine by me. Let's go. (bestial roar) Okay, fuck this. (click) - Hey man-- - Hey yourself. What are you do when you're a squatter and someone breaks in, call the police? Home defense, man. We're urban pioneers. - So I guess it's not Clark. - Maybe it's Clark. I'll take it further, maybe it's Clark and Robert. (roar) (clang) Okay, let's go. (hiss) (bestial roar) (dialing) (phone rings) (gasping) Hello? - Look David, you fascist fuckhead. I know what you're doing. - What am I doing, Tanya? - Knock of the noise. - Guess again, Tanya. We found the incriminating evidence in Clark's room. - Bullshit. - Hey, hurrah for solidarity. We're kinda busy here. (beep) All right, you say there's a Robert. Let's go find him. - Well maybe we should split up. - Is that supposed to be funny? Let's go, everybody! (suspenseful music) (roar) (electrical buzz) (screeching) (distant shriek) (distant growl) (distant growl) (screech) (crashing) (bestial roar) (dramatic music) (exerted breathing) Shit! - Is that the right key? - Let's see. It has a piece of tape on it that says facility two. Shit shit. - What? - What? - It's not the same lock. Somebody replaced it. Man, this is really fucked up. - What, it doesn't work? - Well duh, yes Zak. It's not the same lock. It's brand new. And don't tell me some thing from another world went to the Sandals Hardware Store. - It needs four more victims. There's five of us. - There's six. - Mike's dead. - I'm talking about Robert. (phone rings) - What! - Knock it off. - Knock what off? - Whoever is out in the hall, you better tell them to get the fuck out. - I hate to break this to you Tanya, but we're all out here. - Look David, this is not funny, all right? - You're doing this, aren't you? - What? - You've got tape recorders. You're orchestrating the whole goddamn thing. What's the plan, a little purge of the compound? (roaring) (screech) - Something is in the room. - Maybe it's the ghost of Lenin. - God, give me that! Tanya, can you hear me? Did you find a square of paper? (shrieking) - What? What do you mean? - Did you find a piece of paper with some markings on it? - (stammers) I don't understand. (roaring shriek) What the fuck? (shriek) - What, what's happening? - I don't know. (thud) (snorting) (shriek) (Tanya screams) Oh Jesus! (Elaine shouts) You've got to get it to work! Tanya! (snort) Something's in there. - No no. Hey, you want to pull that pistol out, now would be a pretty good time. - Okay, okay. - Come on. (water drips) (haunting ambient music) (hiss) (eerie echoes) (low growl in distance) (dramatic music) (hissing and screeching) (shouting) (roaring and shrieking) (bestial moan) (roar) - Hold up. - Where is it coming from? - Okay, let's go. (shrieking) How did it get in front of us? - The three-dimensional cross section. - So? - So it can move instantly from one place to the next, even move through walls. - That's fucking great. - It has to be solid to kill us. - Yes. - Okay then, when it's solid we kill it. - Where's my fuckin' phone. - Who are you calling? - Who do you think, National Enquirer? 911. - Well, tell them it's a maniac. Don't tell them it's a monster. They'll never believe you. - Thanks for the hint. Hello? Hello? (shrieking over phone) Shit! It's in the fucking phone! (gunshot) (soft gasp) (dramatic music) - [Clark] Robert! - What the fuck? - Clark! - [Clark] Oh... - [Elaine] Don't bother. - Oh my God. - Can't you give him CPR or something? - He's been shot through the heart. He's dead. - Way to go, David. One guy in the whole world who knows what's going on around here, and you just killed him. - Aren't you gonna cover him up or something? - Why? (click) - I don't suppose you have any more bullets for this gun? - No, I don't. - Well shit. When that thing comes walkin' through a wall, maybe we can throw it at it. - Why isn't it coming after us? Why doesn't it just come after us? - Somebody here knows why. It's killed twice. It'll kill three more times. Three of us have been given the mark, a square piece of paper with a symbol inscribed on it. That's what draws it. Once you've been given the mark, the only way to get rid of it is to give it to somebody else. It kills whoever's been given the mark. That's the price for binding it. Mike, Tanya, and three of us, five lives. That leaves one person left standing, the one person who's been doing all of this, and I know it isn't me. That means it's one of you. As far as I'm concerned, it could be any one of you. - (scoffs) Well I know it's not me. - I'm not so sure. You were here first. You waited until five other people were here. In the other building, when you had to shoot that thing, your aim wasn't so good but you didn't have any problem hitting Robert. Why is that? - Screw you, all right. You're the one who brought her in. Maybe you needed to finish the collection. History major, how about that. Who better set up to learn about all this arcane shit? - Christ, knock it off! - The marks, we should look for the marks. - What? - If you've been given one of those piece of paper, then you're not the one, right? - Right. - But it might not be on you. It could have been passed along in a book, anything. It doesn't have to be on you. - Jesus. What is this? Is this it? This is it. Who did this? Who put this in my wallet? Great. Great. Great. - It's not on me. I'm gonna go search my room. - Clark, (stammers) how do we know if... Fine, fine. You want to hear. You think I'm gonna come over there and force you to take it? Fine, keep your distance. Stay away from me. Go to your room. All of you can stay away from me. I found mine. You find yours! (bestial shrieking) (growl) (moan) (snorting breaths) (high-pitched shriek) (water drips) (shriek) (electric buzz) (shriek) (echoing moan) (hiss) (hiss) (hiss) (snarl) No! (shrieking) (screaming) (roar) (David screams) - Oh my God, David. (thwack) - Zak, no! Zak! - Use your head. If it's not you and it's not me, it's gotta be her. Haven't you noticed everyone else is dead? We'll make her tell us how to get rid of that thing. If worse comes to worst, we'll make her tell us where those damn marks are. We'll force her to take them back. We'll shove them down her throat if we have to! Whoa, hey. What? You think it's me? Is that it? Oh Christ, that's great. That's just great. You think I'm doing this. Why don't you use that? - I'm not sure. - You better get sure. Stay here, watch her. I'm gonna go find that mark while we still have some time. Watch her! - Clark. Where's Zak? - He went to his room. - You heard the Shrieker, right? It went around the stairs with Tanya. You heard him. - Yeah. - That's when it was killing Mike. - I guess. - Who else? Who else was in the damn building Clark, that's still alive? (dramatic music) - What is this? (distant growl) - Stop! - Shit. - Well in case you're wondering, these are symbols of power, protection. As long as you have these on, the Shrieker will leave you alone and can't hurt you. It's sort of like a vaccination. Oh, you don't have any. - Christ, why are you doing this? - Why am I doing this? You wouldn't understand. It's almost time. These things happen on a schedule. - Which one? Which one of us? - I'm not quite sure. (shriek) (electric buzz) (shriek) It's here. It should be reacting by now. - It was you all this time? All this time? - It's hard to explain, Clark. See, it's horrifying but thrilling, really. You should surrender to it. Just let it happen. Just... (crackling) ow. What the... Oh God. (loud crackling) Ow! Oh my God. (gasp) (shriek) (crunch) (gasp) - Come on! (high-pitched shrieking) What happens now? - What? - Well Elaine obviously didn't plan that, and she also didn't draw that mark on her own back. I'd say it came as a big surprise, so who set her up? - I don't-- - Well let's narrow the field a bit. I know it wasn't me. Who does that leave? - I don't know. - I'm doing my best, Clark. God knows I'm doing my best with this whole good guy routine. I want to trust you. I'm trying to, but you keep giving me reasons not to. - Let me go. - No! I'm not gonna let you go. I'm gonna hold on to you so tight that whatever happens to me, happens to you too. (thwack) (Zak gasps) (Zak groans) Jesus Clark. - Of course. Of course. - [Zak] Of course what? (whistling) - Come out, come out. All sorts of complications, but it's almost over. - You fucker. - Back a pace. Just who the hell do you think you are? Norman? Is that you, Norman? In case you're wondering, there are real bullets in this one, not like the one that Elaine loaded into David's gun. - Robert... - Clark, in a couple of minutes the Shrieker's gonna be coming out. Now it can take one of you, him, or the both of you. - What are you talking about? - Well, I hadn't originally planned on killing Elaine, but it became clear to me that her motives were conflicted. She wasn't serious. If she had been, she would have realized that the symbols of protection that I drew on her were phony. Not like these. These are real. Remember Clark, I gave you a choice. Don't ever say I didn't. I said you could leave, but you decided to stay. - I wanted to help the others. - Well now, that obviously didn't work, and I don't believe it. I think you stayed because you wanted to learn. You wanted to test your soul in the furnace. There's wisdom to be found here, dark wisdom. I'll teach you. I'll show you. (roar) (high-pitched shrieking) Well now, that must be the Shrieker. Clark, you might want to stand back. It won't hurt you, not yet, but it could get a little messy. Clark, you are rapidly approaching a moment of truth. You can't save him, but you can save yourself! I think it's a good idea, Clark. Zak, give me the mark. - [Zak] What? - Give me the mark. - No! - Trust me. - What are you doing? (snorting breaths) I am very disappointed in you, Clark. I think we have a lot in common. What the hell are you doing? - Fear is the place that you go to learn, right? Right? (low growl) I'll show you what it taught me. - Wait! (roaring) (buzzing) What are you doing? What are you doing? (shrieking) (gunshot) (shriek) (roar) (electric buzz) (snarl) (buzz) - Is that it? - I think so. - Why do I have the feeling either we should still be trying to kill something, or something should still be trying to kill us? I guess not. (soft laughter) - Come on. I'll get you to the hospital. - Thanks. Oh, wait. We'll need this to shoot the lock off. Somebody's gotta think of these things. (crickets chirp) You know I've been thinking. - About what? - Sleeping in the park. It's not that bad when you think about it. What'd you ever see in that guy anyway? (melodious haunting music) (dramatic symphonic music)
