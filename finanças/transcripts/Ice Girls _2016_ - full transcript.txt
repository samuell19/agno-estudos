Emma! Emma! Come on, Em. We got to get to the rink. You should've seen what happened today. Get the door. Twenty-two kids got sent home from school with lice. Benefits of tea tree oil. Ew! Would you rather get lice? What's with the boxes? Mind your own business, kiddo. Oh, really? Em, get in the driver's seat, key on, pedal to the metal when I say. Got it. Hit it! I know this hasn't been easy for you and how badly you need the funding, so skate clean, it's yours. I will. That was a great skate for Odessa Patterson. Here's her score... You see my mom yet? Stay focused, Mattie. You know what's at stake. This is your year. And don't overthink the triple lutz. You nailed it in warm-up. Don't rush the takeoff. And our next competitor, representing the Toronto Skating Club, is Mattie Dane. You've got this, girl. Hurry! Stay focused, Mattie. Here we go, Mattie. Mattie! Go! The poor kid had a shot at getting a free ride, a grant. She only needed to be in the top five. She was the best one on the ice. She's worked so hard. I've seen her land that jump a hundred times. So how bad is it? Torn meniscus. No skating for 12 weeks, then rehab. No, I-I mean your financial situation. Four months behind on rent. Is there any severance pay? From a used-car lot? Are you kidding? Bummer. Okay. Desperate times, desperate measures. Pack your bags, kiddo. You and the girls are moving in with me. We can't do that. The girls are in school. Our lives are here. Appreciate the offer. I'll make it work. I made the honor roll in high school. No. No college degree. Yes, I know I haven't worked in a medical office, but I'm real good with people. I'm real good with people. I'm real good with people. Okay. Okay, I-I understand. I did teach some fitness classes in my 20s, and actually I did fitness modeling. How old am I? Kelly Dane? Yeah. You've been served. "Seventy-two hours to vacate the premises"? Are you kidding me? Hey... Hey! I could use a little help out here! I thought Aunt Ginger lived in New York. She retired and moved back home. Yeah, she gave up her promising musical theater career. At least she gave it a shot. Forty years is more than a shot. How far is Sudbury? Four boring hours. There's a car dealership there I think I can get a job at. - What about my skating? - We're dealing with a serious injury here. I can still get better for nationals. Baby, we just can't afford skating right now. - Don't do this to me! - It's not all about you, Mattie. We're gonna have to pitch in and make compromises. Yeah, 'cause you can't keep a job. - That's not fair. - This isn't fair. Life is not fair, Mattie. Get used to it. Hey, check this out. Are you cold? Hey, hey. Emma, Mattie. Want anything? It's been a good month but not great, so I'm gonna do something to shake up the sales team. I got someone new coming in... Thanks for showing up, guys. Oh, no. You're giving her a job? A job here, with us? Yes. She's not a local, eh? She's got no customer base here. Yeah. Who's she gonna call? She's got, like, no customers. Zero. Actually, she's from here. She is? Yeah. Okay, but we've got a pretty tight team here. Yeah. You know what an import would do to this team? Yeah, make it better. Okay. Okay, look. I got an idea. She doesn't make a sale in 30 days, she gotta go. Give her 60 days. Thirty days. Bam. Thirty days, gone. She can do it. Okay. But if she doesn't, she's gone. Fair bet? Huh? - Huh? Huh? Huh? - Eh? Bet? - Bet. Bet. - Huh? Huh? - Uh... - Bet it. All right, all right. It's a bet. All right. All right. Jerry? What? Go. Just go. Meeting's over, guys. Wow. Look at the houses. Everyone must be rich on this street. Is everyone rich in Sudbury? Is Aunt Ginger rich? Hardly. I don't know. She did all right. - Better than we have. - Lighten up, Mattie. We've got our health and each other. That ain't bad. - Is this Aunt Ginger's? - Yeah. I love it. All right. Just leave the bags in the car, okay? We'll go in and say hi. Auntie Ginger? Auntie Ginger, are you here? She's not even home, Mom. Really nice welcome. Mattie give it a break. Geez. - Language! I said "geez." You girls hungry? - Girls, we've gotta go shopping. - Oh, crap! I wanted to be here when you got here. Auntie Ginger. Oh, hello! Thank you. Oh, don't mention it. Oh. This must be Emma. Oh, you're as pretty as your mom. Well, not as pretty as me at your age, but still. Very pretty. Oh! Oh, and is this Mattie? Holy mother of God, look at you. I remember when all you did was crap your pants and pick your nose. Oh, you poor thing. How are you feeling? Hello? Who's this? Emma. Who's this? It's Louis. Louis, the car guy? Yep. My mom can sell anything with four wheels and an engine. That's true. She can. Louis? Kelly? - Yes. - Oh, it's so good to hear your voice. You too. I hope you like your rooms. I've had so much fun fixing them up. Okay, we're gonna get you settled, and then... presents for all! Did she say presents? She's trying to buy us. I can be bought. It seems like yesterday we were in high school, right? When are we gonna see you down at the shop? I want to get you starting sales right away. You mean, I have the job? Uh, of course you have the job. Are you kidding me? - I'll see you Monday morning, then. - Oh, gosh, this is swell. I can't believe you're here. Okay, see you Monday. Ciao. Bye. Oh! She's back! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! And... this is your room. Really? This is for a four-year-old. Have you guys seen my room? Never mind. Yours is way worse. You can make it your own. Aunt Ginger just re-did it for me. You know what, Mom? This really sucks. We really didn't have a choice, Mattie Dane. You ruined my life. I did not. You were this close to being funded. You're the one that fell. - Mom! - I can't believe you just said that. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. Okay, very calm, very relaxed, okay? Be a good girl, Rose. And... frown. You would not believe who I just saw at the grocery store. Who? No, no. You can't move, Rose. Who? Can this wait? No. Kelly Dane. Rose! Kelly? Kelly Dane? Yeah. Give us a minute. Yes. At the grocery store here in town? Yes. She had two kids with her. How'd she look? Amazing. I-I mean, okay. Is she just visiting, or is she moving back? I don't know. Oh, forget it. I'll find out myself. Okay, Dr. Schacter, you can come back in now. I'll be a good girl. You got something? Yeah. Good, good. Kid's here. You want me to collect on the debt? Not yet. Now that we know he's at the rink, go see his old man first, if he's not in jail. ♪ We move blindly to the light ♪ ♪ Even though we don't know ♪ ♪ What's inside ♪ See? Easy as pie. Mercury? Mercury, that choreography was all off. You're showing her bad technique. The double axel was weak. The butterfly... eh. And the flying camel was way off. No, it wasn't. Yes, it was. Yes, it was, most definitely. - Can you do it again, please? - Rose... - Do it again. - I'm done. Sorry, kiddo. Good luck. Don't worry about it, Heather. We're better off without him.

Mercury? - It's okay. - Mercury? - Honey, it's okay. I have it. Mercury, this is private ice, is it not? I'll take care of this. Can you have that girl removed, please, and lock the door behind her? Can't do that, Rose. Fire regs. Plus, your hour's up. I'm sorry, but we lost four minutes because of this. You can pick it up on the next session. O-Okay, that's all right. Thank you, Mercury. It's not all right. What are you thanking him for? We paid for the ice. She's good. Okay. "Good's" relative. Haven't seen you before. Just moved here from Toronto. You skate? I did. Injury or money? - Both. - Yeah, figures. You have a coach in Toronto? Yeah, Pat Whillikey. Pat's not bad. You know her? Yeah, I worked with her a long time ago. You planning a comeback? Probably not. You shouldn't have come into this place. The smell gets you every time. Yeah, I should probably get going. - Hey, kid. - Mattie. If you coach, I got a tiny tykes program tomorrow. Regular coach is sick. Don't even need your skates. Thirty bucks an hour. 4:30, sharp. A minute late, you're fired. Okay. Thanks. Uh, I'll see you later. Are you lost? Yeah, first day. Do you know where 2C is? Heather. Mattie. Follow me, Mattie. So didn't I see you at the rink last night? Yeah. You're a great skater. Thanks. I know. So, this is it. All right. Here you go. Ah. Oh. Hi, guys. Uh, Kelly, this is Ben and Jerry, two of our key salesmen. Guys, this is Kelly. So, you're the import, huh? Oh, no, no, wait. You're from here. No, you were from here, but now you're not from here. We hear you think you're pretty hot. Well, so's you know, we're pretty hot too. Keep up the good work, there, boys. See ya. Wouldn't want to be ya. Oh, nice legs. Bros first, man! No, I get ya. No ups for her. Still, that's something. It's impressive, yes. They seem, uh, interesting. Well, appearances can be deceiving. This is a fabulous dealership. Oh, thanks a lot. And this... is yours. Oh, wow. Yeah, pretty good, right? Yeah. Spelled it okay? Uh, coffee? Tea? Me? That's a joke, right? No, thanks. I'm good. So, how are you? No doubt settled down, partnered up. Kids? No, no, no. No, no. I guess I never got over you breaking my heart. This is great. It is. Shall we get down to business? Uh, right, yeah. Your draw-down against sales will be 600 a week. Oh. Is that okay? Oh, yeah. And, um, there's no need to cause any trouble right off the bat, right? Excuse me? Your skirt. What about my skirt? It's a little short. You know, the four Ps? Sorry, the four Ps? "Prudent to appear as professional as possible." That's three Ps. No, it isn't. Yeah, "prudent," "professional," "possible." Three. Well, I always counted "appear" to be a P. You know, you're right. You're absolutely right. "Appear" is an A. So how long do I have? What? Before I have to make my first sale? Uh, well... It's okay. Louis, I'm a pro. Thirty days. No problem. - He's always looking at me. - Who? Him. Darcy. But he's trouble, as in, "stay away from." His dad is in and out of jail, and his mom disappeared a few years ago. Last year, he beat up this kid really bad... Like, really bad. So, what brought you to Sudbury? My mom got a job here. Here? Yeah, believe it or not. Are you getting ready for sectionals? Yeah. You skate? I did. Bombed out at regionals. Injured my knee. Sorry about your knee, but it is cool that you skated. We have a lot in common. Hi, I'm Portia. I'm the school social convener. Mattie. I have a couple questions to get you on the right track. "Track"? So do you qualify yourself as a jock, goth, emo, raver, motor-head, or a princess? Princess, right? Uh... I see it. Been a while, Mercury. You coaching? - No, but I ran into one of your skaters. - Let me guess. Mattie Dane. Yeah. Seems like a good kid. Oh, yeah. No, she's got it. I hated losing her. If she gets her knee back, she can go all the way. She's that good. Thanks. Okay, so let's make two lines. What we're gonna do... push once and glide on one foot. Okay? And under. Good job. Good work. Sadie, when you feel like you're off balance, don't go like this. That'll make you want to go like this or like that. So keep your feet straight and your knees over your toes. There you go. See? Good. Nice work. I'm here if you need me. That's a lot better. And then arms out for balance. Around. There you go. How'd you do that? Whoo. How'd your knee feel out there? Not bad. It hurt, didn't it? Yeah. Yeah, you're doing more than you should. So what are you doing for rehab? Cycling. No, that's not enough. It's free. Is that you? Yeah. Who's that with you? My wife. She was a skater? Yeah, she was great. - Are you guys still married? - No. I'm... sorry. Forty bucks. You were good with the kids today. Thank you. Are you available Thursday? - Yeah. - 4:30 sharp. Don't be late. Leave your skates here. There are lockers in the back. Thanks. I saw you set up to jump. You chickened out. Ugh. Crap. My mom's coming home. I love your house. Yeah, Mom had it custom built. Are you hungry? 'Cause I'm starving? Here, have some. Dig in. How often do you have private ice? Like, five days a week. Oh, sorry. And I do regular sessions too. It's Mercury's dinky rink, and he only offers three a week. Mostly intermediate girls. It's so annoying. I can trust you, right? Yeah. I'd love your opinion on some of my dresses. My mom and I are always fighting over what I should wear. She's burned through, like, four designers. Come on. Your room is really great. Thanks. What do you think? - Gorgeous. - I know, silly, but which one do you like? Heather? Oh. What are you doing? Uh, Mom, this is Mattie. Wait, didn't I see you at the rink? Sorry about that. - You must be new in town. - Yeah, but my mom's from here. - Oh. So it's Mattie... - Dane. Dane. I was getting Mattie's opinion on some of my dresses. - Do you think it really matters? - Well, Mattie skates... or she used to. She got injured at subsectionals. - So you skate. - I did. - Hello? - It's Mercury. Can you make it over to the rink? Now? Yeah. I've got some ice time. Okay, do you see the figure-eight tracings? Yeah. Good. You follow 'em. Why am I following them? Its called patch. Old-school exercises. It's all your knee can handle right now. Eyes on the tracing, arms checked, knees soft. Go ahead. Tighten up your center. You look like a Jell-o sandwich. How long do I have to keep on doing this? You got 40 minutes. Oh, great. If you don't like it, you can get off. Keep it going. I'll be back in a minute. Darcy, it's for you. Yeah. How are you? I'm okay. I was wondering if you could bring some money down to the jail tomorrow. Dad, I don't want to do this anymore, okay? I love you, but I just want you to leave me alone. I'm sorry. What, did you fall doing patch? No. Didn't think so. What happened? I lined up for a jump, and I just... I couldn't do it. I skated right through it, and... I was scared. No one said it would be easy. I don't think I can do it. There comes a time for everyone, no matter who they are, to quit. Maybe it's that time for you. Yeah, I... I think it is. It's okay. It's okay, kiddo. Come on. I'll give you a lift home. Surprise! Oh! For you. How thoughtful. I think so. - Would-Would you like to come in? - Yes. Gosh, yeah. Louis, I'm really so grateful for the job and everything you've done for me, but, Louis, this isn't working. Why not? We dated in grade 10. Best year of my life. We were 15. You were my first. Kiss. Yeah. Shucks, I'm sorry. You haven't changed a bit. The same spiky hair, the "aw, shucks" expressions. That's a good thing, right? Mm... Look, I can change. No. I like you. But... But friends. Can we just be friends? Sure. Excuse me. Sorry. I'd better go see what that is. I'd really like to keep on coaching the kids. Yeah, that would... that'd be fine. Your mom? Yeah. Mom, this is Mercury. He gave me the job at the rink. Kelly. That doesn't sound good. How old is this truck? Old. - Let's see if we can get it started. - Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. You should come down and see me. Palladino Honda? Great idea! We got a sale on! Okay, I can't breathe. Okay, pop the clutch. Ooh! I got to start working out. I got to start working out. Okay. Second string on the second fret. There you go. Now take your ring finger and put it on the third string, also on the second fret. Just like that. That's it. That's A-minor. So now the second chord, this one's really easy. It's literally only two strings. You did get it. There you go. Nice one. You're gonna take your ring finger... just one more up... there we go... to the D. There you go. Nice one. Hey, Mattie. Hey, Heather. Had private ice this morning. Nailed my triple lutz. Five in a row. I'm so happy. Want to come to my house after school? Darcy, good to see you. This thing ain't going away. Don't make it worse. Don't make it worse. Get off me, man. Hey, what's going on? - It's okay, Merc. - Is it? It doesn't look okay. Darcy here owes us money. That true, Darce? My father owes him. Twelve hundred. Dad's in jail again, debt goes to the kid. Merc. Seven hundred. You give it to Mo, you tell him it's square. I don't think so. This is my house. No one comes into my house and threatens anyone. Your move. Make it. You got lucky. Let's go. I'm sorry, Merc. Darce, you got any problems, you come to me. Yeah, yeah. Hey. Did you see the hair? Yeah. No, no. I don't want you to miss this opportunity. Great, yeah. See you then. Mercury just showed up. Wants to go for a test drive. I'm thinking the CR-V. Like it? Really, I'll-I'll get out and push. No, you're the client. I'll push. Well, you were the one that said it could handle it. Yep, I did say that. Yep. No problem. I hired the best choreographer in North America for you. Angel Stojko, an Olympic champion, is willing to work with you. It's exactly what you need to win the nationals. I still have to win my section first, Daddy. The sectionals is a shoo-in. We know that. This is your year to win the nationals. Honey, you're up from your nap. Of course I'm up. With this racket, I thought I was missing a party. Sorry, honey. Honey, are you putting on weight? Uh, no. No, you're... you're looking a little hippy there. - Rose, maybe you shouldn't... - Oh, hush, Henry. Her dress is custom-made. Her measurements can't change.

What do you think about going to nationals? I didn't even qualify for sectionals. I'll get you into sectionals. Is your mother there? Look, Louis, you're calling on the home phone and I'm trying to do my homework. Yes, sorry. It's just, she isn't answering her cell. - She's at work. - No, she isn't. Yes, she is. No, she isn't. Yes, she is. No, she isn't. I made my first sale! - I so want your job. - Whoo! She nailed a sale in 17 days. Ugh. I hate it when he does that. Yeah. He is getting better at it, though. Eh. Any pain? A little. MRI shows a longitudinal tear in the meniscus. Can you, uh, straighten your leg out for me? Not too bad. The doctor in Toronto said I couldn't skate for 12 weeks. It can get better, but it is vulnerable to further injury. We can do PRP. What's that? Platelet-rich plasma. Blood spinning. It speeds up the healing process. - Okay. - These treatments are expensive. Does the family have money? I'll cover the treatments. Then she must be good. More than good. She can go all the way.

Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Where are your arms, Heather? Up. Up. Ball of light in your chest. Beautiful swan, not sick, little duck. Use your arms. It's not Riverdance. Why do you live at the rink? Well, my dad's a drunk. He's in and out of jail. What about your mom? She took off. I guess she just couldn't stand him anymore. That's rough. It's okay. I was practicing at the rink a lot. Mercury kind of took me in. Gave me a job, let me sleep in the dressing rooms. It's okay. Heather said you got in a fight with someone and hurt him pretty bad. Yeah, it was a... it was a hockey fight. Is that why you can't play anymore? I can play. The guy I hurt, he was a friend, and he can't play anymore, so... I figured... I don't deserve to. I'm sorry. Think we're gonna need to get your hair highlighted before sectionals too. And I was thinking a little Botox wouldn't hurt. For who? You don't want to be frowning when you skate. The judges like a nice, calm, smooth face. You don't know what the judges like. Good taste is universal, dear. Besides, I'm just looking out for your best interests. Didn't I warn you about Mattie? Hey, Heather. Why did you lie to me? Was it all a con to see what I was planning? See what I was wearing, hear my music? I never lied to you. You said you weren't skating anymore, but you are. I even shared my secret potato chip stash with you. Hello? It's Mercury. I'm really liking the CR-V. Really? That's excellent news. Listen, if you're not busy tonight, I thought maybe you'd like to grab a bite to eat. You mean, like, a date? A date, date? Yeah, I guess, if you're not busy. - Well, actually I am busy. - Oh. I'm having dinner with you. Okay, so you take the outside edges and fold them in the middle to hide the edges, and then you break it in three, like this. Okay, we'll try that again. Aw. I never saw my mom do it like this. Well, now you know. Sort of. Aunt Ginger, can I ask you something? Well, I don't know if I can answer, but fire away. If you don't tell someone, like, exactly what you're doing, it's not lying, is it? Not that you're doing anything wrong, but... Well, that might depend on who you're not telling and what you're doing. In my books, lie to no one. I mean, if you love them, be honest with them. They deserve it, and so do you. And if you don't love them, why go to the trouble of lying, right? Okay, here. Try a bigger one. Try the biggest one. All right. Outside. Mattie, you can talk to me. Honey, what's the matter? I lost my only friend I had at school. What happened? I lied to her. I didn't mean to, but... I did. And I lied to you too. I think it's great that you gave Mattie a job and that you got her such a fantastic sports doctor. On top of that, apparently you're coaching her for free. Did you think she's an orphan? Or are you just trying to play hero? Well, guess what... I don't believe in heroes. She told me she told you. She told me she was coaching little kids. Do you even have kids? You don't, do you? It was your responsibility to make sure I knew. Parental consent... ever hear of it? I'm sorry. You shouldn't be filling her full of dreams that can't happen. That's what you think... that this can't happen for her? Not on my salary. I'll cover the cost. No. I've taken enough handouts. This is not a handout. Really? What is it, then? I want a champion, and I think Mattie's it. What about her knee? She's doing rehab. It's strong and getting stronger. Kelly, you've got to let her skate. You were a skater. You know exactly what this means. Look, I don't have a lot going on in my life. - That's obvious. - Not since my wife died. I'm sorry. Mattie needs this. Maybe I need this just as much. And maybe so do you. Maybe together, we have a shot. Okay, Mattie, let's do the whole program. Okay. Turns out Angel is available, so we're taking the ice after all. You canceled. Mattie has the ice. We paid for it, so we're un-canceling. Heather, go get your skates on, sweetie. Can you help her? It's okay. You stay with me, honey. Kelly, I heard you were back in town. We've missed you. I had no idea you were Heather's mother. Well, insight never was your strong suit. Heard the modeling thing didn't work out, huh? And you ended up hawking used cars. Oh, and Mickey left you? Not true, but this isn't about you and I, is it? No, this is about my daughter, and I'm not gonna let you mess with her. Look, you take half the ice, we'll take the other half. You want us to share the ice after we've paid for it? There's plenty of ice. It's that way or the highway. Well, look who's been making friends here already. That was very tense. I love drama. Mickey. Wild Mickey P. Yeah. Rose and I were 19, both skaters, and she fell hard for him. Let me guess... He fell for you. So Mattie is the daughter of two skaters. Yep. ♪ So it will be ♪ ♪ Another me ♪ ♪ If it comes to be ♪ You know, you don't have to do this. Are you gonna kick her off? No. Then I have to do it.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's this? Personal space, people! Heather! Enough! Get off the ice now! You can't blame Mercury for being mad at you. I mean, what if you hurt yourself doing something so stupid? And all the hard work that you've done, all the hard work he's done to get you into sectionals? He got me in? Yeah, he said he would. Wow! Heather, you can't let her beat you. You're better than she is. You are. Now, promise me that you're gonna win. Heather, are you listening? Promise me that you're gonna beat her. And how can I promise you that? It's called the law of intention, Heather. You just make the intention. It has to be crystal-clear. Your intention needs to be, "I'm gonna beat this girl." And, well, obviously, anybody else. Right, shouldn't her intention just be to be the best she can be? No. That's not a very worthwhile intention, Henry. Oh, sometimes you're so thick. No. Promise me that you're gonna beat her. Yes, Mom. "Yes, Mom" what? Promise I'll win. Honey, I think you've had enough, yeah? Mattie's gonna need an amazing costume. We'll be her official sponsor. I'll call Ross. Ross? He's my BFF. Works for the Ice Capades. He'll whip up a costume in, like, a week. Guarantee you it'll be stunning. Oh, my gosh! This is exciting! Palladino's first skater! Are you all right, honey? Are you eating something? No. Yes, you are. What are you eating? Uh, nothing. Give it to me. No! No! Potato chips? Really? Empty calories, full of fat, full of grease, bad for your skin, for your figure. Are you sabotaging yourself? No, you're sabotaging me. Did I raise a loser? No. I don't think so. Heather, I'm only thinking about you here, okay? You need to do whatever it is you need to win the competition, right? Okay. Failure's not an option. Potato chips are not part of that. Are you crying? No, I just got a little piece of potato... potato chip in my eye. Heather took them! Hey, you don't know that. Yes, I do! What matters is getting you another pair of skates. Even if Mercury finds some skates that fit, you won't have time to get used to them. And with the knee, maybe it's best we just sit this one out. Come on. You're young. There's plenty of competitions ahead for you. I'm competing, Mom. One way or another, I am competing. Look what I found in the garage. Clearly, I keep everything. All right, what size are you? Like, an eight and a half. Eight and a half. Let's see what we can find in here. Oh, my goodness. Oh, my God. Here are your skates. These were custom made for your mother. Oh, they need a little sharpening, but... Come on. Let's try them on. - Wouldn't it be great? - These might be magic. It's gonna work. I can loosen them a little bit more. Pull up on it. It's too tight. Let's just loosen... They won't fit! Forget it. I'm sorry I ever started skating again! I can't believe... Sorry about that. Heather, the fabric doesn't lie. - It's too tight. - You had them make it too tight. Don't be ridiculous. We're gonna have to let this out. Do you know what? I'm not competing. Do not... Do not pull this on me now, okay? Not after everything I've put out for you. What you've put out? What about what I've put out? The abuse I take from you. It's not abuse, Heather. It's guidance. I am trying to help you become a better person. You just want me to win. Of course I want you to win. I'm not competing. I'm not. It's my decision. No, it isn't. Not after everything I've sacrificed for you, the number of days I have spent in that cold arena drinking bad coffee. You'll compete, and you'll win. Do you understand me? You will compete, and you'll win. And this conversation's over. ♪ And the love will drown the pain ♪ ♪ Right in the world ♪ ♪ In my dreams ♪ ♪ And the promises ♪ ♪ Would carry us through ♪ ♪ In my dreams ♪ ♪ And the love will drown the pain ♪ ♪ Right in the world ♪ Hello? Wow. Really? Wow. You're kidding. I'll tell her. Honey, you're not gonna believe this... Your skates are back. Really? Yes. Oh, honey. Very sassy. Thank you, Palladinos. Oh, put it on, put it on. I want a fashion show. You okay? Yeah. Maybe a little nervous. Mattie, no matter what happens, I want you to know how very proud I am of you. Honey, and I want you to do one thing for me tomorrow. What's that? Go out there and have the time of your life. You're doing what you love, so go and skate your heart out. Good night, baby. Good night. Not bad. She was good. Better than I thought. Yeah. Wasn't that wonderful? We love you. We love you, Mattie! Yeah! Hey, kid. How you feeling? Good. Someone wants to meet you. Tessa Virtue. It's so nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I saw you win your gold medal. How's the knee feeling? A lot better, thanks. Good. You've earned this. You're gonna be great. Thank you. Well, I just wanted to wish you luck. Have fun. Thank you. Thanks. That was nice. You all set? Yeah. And up next, folks, from Parry Sound, Ontario, Suzie Kado, here competing for the regional championship title. Holy moly, these kids are good. Can Mattie top this? We'll see. And up next, folks, from Parry Sound, Ontario... Ronnie Daas, Dina Evangelisti, Lori Sawka. The mark for Lori is 89.97. Lori will be disappointed with that score. 148.23, the combined score for Ruth Webster. And up next, folks, is Mattie Dane. Go, Mattie! Mattie Dane is just back on the ice after a recent serious knee injury. Now, that's what we all call a true competitor. Oh, my God. I can't look.

Yay, Mattie! We knew you could do it! Love you! Mattie! You were amazing. Thank you. The score for Mattie Dane's long program is 102.30, giving her a total score of 158... What place? You're in... You're in first. First. You're in first! The next skater, from Lively, Ontario, representing the Sudbury Skating Club, is Heather Lear. She looks gorgeous. Quiet! Heather? Folks, there seems to be some problem. Let her go, kiddo. This is yours. She's my friend. Wow. Heather, what are you doing? I'm the one. I took your skates. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. But you brought them back. I'm sorry. You deserve to win, Mattie. I don't deserve to skate, not after what I did. You have to get back out there, Heather. It's not fair to anybody, especially yourself. Just look at me. I'm a mess. No. You're the black swan, and you look just how the black swan should... beautiful. Thank you. Heather! Thirty seconds to get back on the ice, or you're disqualified. Come on. Thirty seconds to rock and roll. Come on. Go. Go, Heather. Please? Do it for me. Yes! She's crying. Brilliant strategy. Adding drama to the moment... Look. The judges can't take their eyes off her. I didn't think she had it in her. Good girl. Shut up, Rose. Seriously, not another word. Sh... Not a word. Class move, kid. Class move. You would've done the same. Nope. Not a chance. Okay, Heather, let's do this. That's it. She only did a double. It was perfect, and so is she. Way past time you realized that, Rose. Our daughter is perfect just the way she is. It's too bad you can't see that. I feel sorry for you. She is perfect, isn't she? Oh, she's great. Thank you. I'm so proud of you, honey. Oh, Mom! 157.75. Our winner is... Mattie Dane! Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for the medals ceremony. What a competition. Three young ladies here on the podium, but many more that entertained us and gave us a fantastic day. And we have a special guest, an Olympic gold medalist, to present the medals herself... Tessa Virtue. If you would, please grab the bronze medal and present it to Suzie Kado! The silver medal to Heather Lear! And now, the winner, our gold medalist, Mattie Dane. - Way to go, Mattie. - Thank you. Mattie Dane will be representing us at the nationals. Thank you. Thank you.
