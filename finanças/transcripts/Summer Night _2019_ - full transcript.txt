I was supposed to text her before we came up here. - That's it? - And, um... I take it you got service. Wow! What did you do? Holy shit. Can I get you anything? Are you sure? What are we all doing in the bathroom? Oh, Mama. Yeah, bro, we have to get the cigarettes. Isn't that your English teacher? Yes, it is. - Mr. Ford! - Yo, what's up? Oh, hey, guys. How's your summer goin'? It's hot. Sucks. Can you buy us some cigarettes? - Yeah, bro'. - What? - No, you guys are kids, come on. - What? You smoke all the time. We've seen you. - Well, it's illegal, okay? - Are you serious? Lame. I'll steal them from my mom. Stay out of trouble, guys. You know, that was us once. Still is. If children are the future, we're fucked. You know what? I don't think I'm going back to that teaching job. Why, 'cause of that kid? No, man, I just don't really care, you know? So, like, what's the point? You gonna hang around and be an asshole like the rest of us? You sound like my dad. Hey, sweetie? How 'bout we just take a little break from texting for now, okay? This was not the plan. I still have three more years of grad school. I just don't even see how this can work. Okay, stop beating yourself up, for fuck's sake, Mel! You didn't do anything wrong. And, honestly, it's not like you have to make the decision right now. So, the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna get you out of the tub. - Out of the tub. - Oh, my god. We're gonna go downstairs, we're gonna watch a movie, and it's gonna be really fun. - I want my phone. - No. It's Jack. Oh, okay, that's it. I'm getting margarita stuff. Well, it's not really the time for margaritas-- I'll make hers a virgin. - Sorry. Can I--? - Go, go, go, go. Hi, Jack. No, I know I called, and I'm so sorry, but now's really not a good time. You said it was important. What's up? I know I said that, and it is, but it's really not a good time. So, can I just see you at the show? You're freaking me out. Just tell me what's going on. Okay, well, at my sister's wedding last weekend... Well, I, um... I met a guy. Jack? Are you still there? Hey, Rabbit! So, what's up with you and Mel? Can't tell you. What the fuck do you mean, you can't tell me? That's bullshit. Talk to me. Wish I could. All right, fine. I'll just drive over there myself, - and I'll fuckin' ask her. - No, come on, man. Yo, seriously. Don't do that. - Yo! - Here we go. Dude, just pull over! Jesus, man, what the fuck is wrong with you? You trying to kill us? Yo, can you please pull over, man? This is why you don't have a car. - Fuck, Christ, dude! - Fuck you. Dude, you have no fuckin' idea what you're doing. - Stop this shit, man! - Oh, hello, Vanessa. Wonder what she's doing? Oww! - Hey, buddy. - What's going on? Oh, you know, the usual disasters. - Yeah? - Hey, have you seen Seth? You know, I just saw him a second ago. Well, when you talk to him, tell him he needs to call Mel. Okay, I'll pass that along. What is the deal with them? I can't really say, but, um... just tell Seth to get his ass over here, okay? Hey, I'll see you later, right? - What's later? - Come on, you're going. Of course I'm going, dickhead. I'll see you at the Alamo. You happy? Fuck. I hate you. Sounds like you're really in for it. Yeah. Look, I'm sorry for hassling you, man. It sounds like it's bigger than I thought. Yeah, it fuckin' is. Well, whatever "it" is, you better just talk to her about it, right? You can't hide from it. Just let me out. No, I'll drive you over there. Just, seriously, dude, just pull over. Dude, it's like a thousand degrees out here. Yeah, no, I know. I gotta clear my head. All right, fine. Rraaaarrr! Oh, fuck, man, that hurt. - Stay down, bitch! - Fuck! Okay, get his wallet. And his phone. That's not his fuckin' phone. Give him your fuckin' phone - or I'll fuckin' cut your dick off! - Take the phone. - I'm attached to my dick. - Do it! We need to get outta here. All right. Wait, I want his shoes. Fuck off! Come on. My shoes, man. Are you serious? Call the cops, we'll murder you in your sleep! You assholes have my phone! Fuck! What's up there, Andy-boy? What are you getting up to today?

Mucho apreciado, brother. Pumped for the show tonight? Yeah. I got a date. Really? Nice one, Jammers. Who's the lucky lady? - This party girl, Harmony. - Okay. So Gatsby finally gave up the dream of the golden girl. I was not Gatsby over Corin. I'm gonna go inside and shower before you disprove that with written evidence.

How are you, old boy? Hey, Andy. I talked to Lexi. Lexi. I like her. She slept with some bro at her sister's wedding last weekend. I hate her. - Jameson, get out here! - What's up? Lexi got boinked by some dude at her sister's wedding. Shit. Not the groom, I hope. Groomsman. Some water polo player. I'm really sorry, man. I know you had your heart set on her. Well, it's all right. She's not my girlfriend. She never was. I guess Santa Barbara meatheads are her type. Jameson, get this man a beer. Have I gotta do everything around here? You got it. Why'd she tell you? I don't know. She probably feels weird. Maybe to see how I'd react. - How did you react? - About like this. She does understand that you don't express emotions - like a normal person, right? - Thanks. Was she apologizing? It was more like confessing? Sh-- She was a virgin. - Like you. - Yeah, let's not talk about it. Jack Rabbit, talk about it. It'd be good for you. It's fine. She didn't cheat on me. We're friends. Girls get drunk and screw at weddings. It happens. Not with me, but it happens. I'm very sorry, Jack Rabbit. I really gotta get ready. Are you sure you don't wanna talk about this? No, absolutely not. I regret saying anything already. You know what makes me feel better? Beer? No. Yes, but no. Yaaaah! Taylor? Hey, you're, uh... You're Wells' little sister, right? What happened to you? I was-- I was biking, and a couple of guys hit me. Is it bad? Yeah, you're bleeding. Yeah, I feel kinda crazy 'cause of all the adrenaline. I'm gonna-- I'm gonna sit down. I'm gonna sit down. Okay. I think you need stitches. I'm not gonna pay a doctor for stitches. I'll just-- I'll superglue it. - I gotta lie down. - Oh, no. No, no, no. I think you might have gotten a concussion. Okay. We are gonna get you some butterfly bandages. Wait here. Fuck! No, no, no. Come on. Super gluing your face together is, like, really white trash. Taste that, man? It's that blueberry shit, man. Blueberry antioxidants. Oh, shit, man. - This shit tastes like blueberries, Ricky. - Let me hit it. I wanna put that shit on my pancakes. Mm! That's my jam! Yo, it tastes like my grandma's blueberry cobbler. Oh, yeah! Oh, wait. Actually, this is strawberry. Classic. Yo! Seth! - Oh, shit! - What are you doing here, man? Come in here. - What's up, man? - Hit this shit. Yeah, it's blueberry. It's strawberry. - It's strawberry. - Yeah, man? Good shit, huh? Let's keep on that, brother. Come on. - Poor face. - Is it that bad? Now you're worried? You were gonna superglue yourself back together. It's real nice of you to buy all this stuff. - I'll pay you back. - Oh, no, no, don't mention it. You are all set. I don't know what to say. This is so nice of you. Look, there's a cop. Go talk to him. - They've gotta catch those guys. - Thanks. Um, my band's playing the Alamo tonight. You should come. Cool. Yeah, maybe. No, seriously, I mean it. Come to the show. All right. Thanks. Uh, excuse me, Officer. I just got jumped on the bike path. Shit. Another one. All right, hop in. I'll take you home and do a report. What the hell are you doing? They take your shoes? Just hop in the car. You're not in trouble. See you tonight. - Hey, can we use the sirens? - Sure. - Is that Seth? - Come in. Daughter, how was the moving picture tonight? Hey. Hey, Sethy. I didn't think you had it in ya. Oh, well, then I'll stick to these. These don't talk. That big buck Norman Maine was in the picture tonight. Never does anything but kiss a lot of girls. - Are you high right now? - No. I can't have this conversation if you're fucked up. I'm not, okay? I'm just, I'm freaked out. Yeah! Well. I feel like I just don't wanna do anything stupid. Oh, it's a little late for that. What's that supposed to mean? - You came inside of me, Seth. - You told me to. No, I know, but I didn't actually mean it. It was like a passion, heat-of-the-moment thing. I didn't... mean it. Mel, I just do what you say. No, I'm not blaming you. I just... I need to know what you think about it. I don't know what I'm supposed to say, all right? Like, you just seem really mad at me right now. What are you doing? It's Caleb, all right? I gotta hit Caleb back. I'm fucking pregnant, Seth. And you're texting Caleb? Are you telling him about this? Because you probably want me to get an abortion, but I have a fucking fetus growing - in fucking whatever this is. - Mel. Mel. I never said anything about you getting an abortion, okay? Whether you wanna keep the baby, that's not my call. And I'm not telling Caleb about anything, okay? I'm just saying that I'm gonna be late to sound check, and he's pissed 'cause I'm not telling him why. That's not your call? No. You should really figure out what's important to you, Seth. Just go. Okay. What I'm saying is that rock 'n' roll started going downhill when they stopped having saxophone players. I'm talking about Bobby Keys, Clarence Clemons. I'm talking about the time when rock 'n' roll used to stir positive emotions with big backing horns, dude. That's all gone now. Oh. I love nacho cheese so much. Mel's pregnant. What?! Yeah. What the fuck, dude? How the fuck do you get your girlfriend pregnant? This is isn't 1937. And weren't you using a condom? Isn't she on birth control? This is offensively irresponsible, okay? - Think about the band. - Can you please calm down? - I will not calm down! - I'm supposed to be the one freaking out right now. What's she wanna do? Fuck, man, I can't be a dad. - Shit. - Oh, shit, just act normal. And stay off the bike trail, please. - Thanks very much. - Have a good night. Taylor? Yo, what happened to your face, man? - I need a drink. - Get in a fight or something? Okay, let's do this. Alamo! - Hey, Corin. - Oh, hey, Taylor. - Can I have a beer? - Yeah, sure. - Thank you. - Hi, handsome. Oh, shit, what happened to your face? Ah, you know. - You fighting cheetahs again? - Yes, I was. - What's up, man? - You look like shit. Did you get attacked by a seagull? Your face looks wrecked. You think it'll ruin my modeling career? You okay, man? A couple of tweakers jumped me on the bike path. But this real nice cop took me home. Got my shoes, got my bass, so I'm all good. - Damn. - Hey, guys. - Man. - How much did they take? I think, just like 20 bucks, but, you know, they took my phone and my brother's bike, so there's that. Shit, dude. So some methhead is looking at your collection of dick pics. Well, I hope so. Hey, Smokey, can I have an E? Small collection. - Hi. I'm Jame-- - Harmony, your date's here! Okay! Justin Lerner, the vacuum cleaner repairing poet! You ever write poems about repairing vacuum cleaners, Justin? Uh, no, sir, I don't. All right, you ready to give this a shot? - Yes, I am. - Okay! Give her a whirl! Hey, Jameson. It's landed on 200! Very good. Now, Justin-- Hey. Who's this little cutie? You know I have a kid, right? No, I didn't. - You look freaked out. - No, I just didn't know. He'd like to solve the puzzle. Go ahead, Justin. "Be careful what you wish for"? I'm fucking with you. This is Annie. She's my sister's. All right. She's fed, she's clean, she's changed. She should really go to bed now. - Okay. - And turn off the TV. Read her a book, for fuck's sake. Let's go. I never wear a seatbelt, but I'm starting to feel like I should wear a seatbelt in your car. - Why, am I scaring you? - I don't know why. I'm just starting to realize how much I like being alive. Come on, this is being alive, Jameson! Yes. Ah! - You like Destroyer? - I love Destroyer. The horns in it remind me of Springsteen, which reminds me of my dad. He was a Springsteen guy, you know? The only thing he loved more than The Boss was me and my sister. Where's your dad now? He's dead. - God, I'm really sorry. - I was a kid. Work accident. He was a lineman. My parents were divorced when it happened. My mom's been married a bunch of times since then. Ooh, a spot. Hi, everyone. Thank you. We're Rain and Rivers, and we're stoked to be here.

The kids don't understand what's going on, and it's a terrible, terrible experience for the adults. It's probably for the photos, you know, so you can convince your kid you weren't such a shitty parent. Never get old, Seth. It's not worth it, man. All right. Good talking. Yeah, man, same, man.

I'll never forget the first time I saw 'em in the church basement. They should've been huge. The Plan was as good as any other band like them, but they were great 'cause they didn't give a shit. You gotta convince everybody how great you are just to believe it yourself. Does it even matter? Is this, like, all you guys do? Sit around and talk about bands nobody cares about? We have barbecues sometimes. You should come over. Don't. Savings Plan is on! Feels real good to be playing as a band again. But it's even better to be here with all of you.

I think everybody's going to LaSalles, if you're interested. Or we could just go to my place instead. Yeah, I mean, don't you wanna get a drink first? You're a good guy, Jameson. I'll see you later. Wait, why? Because when I ask if you wanna come over to my place, the answer needs to be a resounding yes. You need to finish up with that other girl. No, it's not like that. I don't date guys who are only sort of into me. It's one of those things I've learned after dating dirtbags for a long time. But call me when you figure your shit out. What the fuck am I doing? That's the answer full of love, man. You know what I mean? Seriously, man, it's like the ocean. You know how the waves come in. - Luke. What's up, man? - You heading out? - Where's everybody going? - LaSalles. It's gonna be a shit show. Ah, please, man. I'm a dad now. You know how many chores I had to trade in to get a night off? You goin'? Yeah. I've gotta figure something out first though. All right. Hey, you can't build a house using your head for a hammer. Yeah. Wait, what? All right, young bloods. Be safe, have fun. I'm off to the homestead. Vaya con Dios, Luke! There goes a real hero of the faith. They want us out. Go to LaSalles or go home. - You comin'? - To the bar? - Yeah. - Well, I'm not 21. It's fine. I've been going to LaSalles since I was 16. You're goin'. The night's not over yet. Hey, Taylor. Take a picture with me. Come on, what are you doin'? Who's driving me to LaSalles? Okay, come on. Hey. You going out after this? It depends how long it takes me to clean up this mess. Well, I'll be out, wherever we wind up. - On your date? - She went home. She's really cool though. You'd like her. Yeah, okay. Well, don't get too wild before I find you. I wanna talk to smart Jameson, not drunk and emotional Jameson. It's a little embarrassing. Actually I am drunk, emotional Jameson. Okay. Just remember, J, I like you better when you're you. Mel? No, no. Can we-- Can we please not do this right now? Why can't you just take me home? Let's just have one drink, and I'll take you home afterwards. I don't wanna go out, and I don't want you to stumble into my room at 3:00 a.m. like it's a romantic gesture. Seriously, you're gonna make me cry. And I fucking hate crying. - Seth, we are pregnant. - I know. - And you're acting like everything is fine. - I fucking know. I know nothing's fine, all right? I'm not stupid. I just wanna go to the bar with my friends and my band and have one drink. And I want you to be there. I don't see what the big deal is. Okay. You do whatever you wanna do. Rabbit, you wanna go to... You wanna get a drink? I'm walking Lexi home. ♪ And now I'm home and I'm all alone ♪ ♪ Wanna hit the road ♪ ♪ And make some stupid decisions ♪ ♪ And I don't want them back ♪ ♪ One, two, three, four ♪ ♪ One, two, ready, go ♪ Is there a password or something? Yeah, the emergency exit alarm is broken. It's kind of a secret. It's good to be out here though. In a dark alley? You should be more careful, Taylor Peters. You could get jumped again. I mean, it's nice to be out here with you. Oh, look, there's the guy that you love that doesn't want you. - Have I told you that I'm single right now? - Shit. Where are you goin'? I'll wait for you. What's up, gents? How's it going? So, I know you're bummed about Corin, and I know she's nice, yeah, but she's always fucking with your head, man. - I'm fine. - It's not even that. It's... If you quit teaching and you piss away your hard work for whatever reason, for Corin or whatever bullshit reason, man, I'm gonna hit you with my car. You don't have a car, Seth. Dude, I'll fucking hit you with your car. You gonna tell me what's up with Mel? She's pregnant. How are you feeling? Well, man, I feel like... I feel like no matter what we do, whether we keep the baby or not... Yeah, chug that shit! It's like none of this is gonna be the same. Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug! Man, you're drunk! Is it such a bad thing? Hey, Jameson. What's a girl gotta do to get a pitcher of gin and tonic around here, huh? Go be with her. What's good, amigo? Dude, I gotta get out of here before I end up old and alone. - Like me? - No, dude, you're cool. You got, like, four different girlfriends. Sometimes. What's up, girl? Get outta here. Go make love. But in the darkness, realize that in the grips of love that you are so close to death and that love is the only bulwark against death. Keep an eye on our boy. I hate my life. - Bye. - Bye, babe. She's not 21. She's wearing, like, a shit brown skirt and a white top. Are you listening? - Point her out to me. - Okay, look. I don't want her to know I told on her, okay? I just don't think it's cool for her to be here. All right. Shit brown skirt. Not 21. I'll take care of it. Thank you. When? Sometime after you stop bothering me. - Night, Rabbit. - Yeah. Thanks for taking care of me tonight. Good night, friend. Jack, you're acting like we don't even know each other. That's kinda how it feels. Are you dating this guy? No. That's why I wanted to talk to you. I mean, what happened? Did he...? No, it's not like that. I wanted it to happen. Okay? It was nice. Okay, I don't need to hear all this. Jack, I'm just trying to talk to you. I don't wanna hear about how nicely this guy screws. I think I was wrong about what was going on between us. No. I think I was. I was wrong about how I felt about you. But I'm not gonna beat myself up about it, okay? It happened. But it should have been... us together for the first time. What does that mean? It means I wanna be with you. If you can accept the fact that I'm not perfect and... Well, if you still wanna be with me, so... Wait, stop, stop. Hold on. Let's just slow down. You said you wanted it to be me. I know I did. And I do. Look, I'm here. And I just told you how I feel. But this is all new territory for me. So maybe tomorrow, or the next day, or the day after that, we'll see how it goes. But not here. Not in my kitchen. And not until after you've thought about it. You know, put a little effort into it. Okay. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Okay, good night. We look like a depressing version of a Norman Rockwell painting. You okay? I'm just-- I can't wait to move to New York next year. Yeah, I hear life in New York is really easy and convenient. I'm tired of this town, Jameson, and all the pathetic shit that goes on. Hey, you mind walking me home? Not at all. I'm gonna go hit the head, tell Andy I'm leaving. Well, I'll be here with this bucket of gin. All right, come on. - I wish we'd met before today. - We did. You know what I mean, I mean like this. - You wanna know something funny? - What? - Actually, never mind. - What? No, never mind. No, what is it? Tell me. - Tell me. - It's embarrassing. Well, embarrassing for you or embarrassing for me? - For me. - Well, then, you gotta tell me. You were the first boy I had a crush on. Really? Ha ha! Yeah. You'd come over to my brother's to play music, and I'd get so mad 'cause he wouldn't let me watch. I mean, we were just playing really bad covers of Ramones songs, so I don't think you were missing very much. Yeah, I know. I listened from my room. Handy Andy. I'm gonna go walk Corin home. Gonna be here for a while? Yeah, a few more. I'll catch you at the house. All right. Watch out, you old romantic. I know how moonbeams and gin get to you. Don't worry about me. I'm a big boy. It's a mother's job to worry. - Milady. - Thanks. Hey, let me see your I.D.? - Oh, um... - Is there a problem? Uh, I must have dropped it. If you don't have an I.D., I don't know how you got in here. It's all right, she's with me. You and your high school girlfriend are leaving before I call the cops. Wanna get out of here? Yeah, it's... it's kinda dead, right? Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Come on. - I'm so sorry. - No, it's fine. I'm so sick of this shit. Thanks for walking me home. Of course. It's finally starting to cool down. You said you wanted to talk. What did you wanna talk about? Why'd you get drunk at my birthday party, say all that stuff? It was nice how this was, being friends. Why'd you... mess it up? I didn't realize I was messing anything up by telling you how I feel. Okay. You just don't like hearing it. I mean, I'm-- I'm not gonna argue with you, Jameson. But I think if we were in a real city, you'd be over this by now. It's been such a strange summer. Ugly, smoky days and pretty nights. - Corin-- - You know what, Jameson, it's-- it's getting late, I should get to bed. Let's... Let's not do this tonight, okay? But you're always hiding from me. Just tell me what you want. I... I still don't know what to say. Look, J, like, you can go anywhere. You can do anything. You have all these plans and dreams for your life, and none of them include hanging around your deadbeat friends - and drinking beer. - Corin, I mean, I'm alive, and I'm sitting here on this porch swing with you. And I don't think it gets any better than this... you know. I'm sorry, Jameson. I've been such a bitch. And you're so sweet and... I just... I don't know why I... I can't do this. 'Cause you don't want to. I have this... idea in my head of what I want my life to be like and what it should be like, and then you just keep... messing it up. Good night, Corin. You know, I have lived in this town all my life, and I have never gone night swimming. You wanna go in? Oh, I'm not skinny-dipping, sorry. Well, that's fine, good. I'm incredibly modest. Just dive in. Uh, I don't wanna get my clothes wet. But I, uh... But I do wanna go swimming. - Is it cold? - Well, certainly. Are you gonna check the water? Nope. Oh! - How is it? - It's perfect. Oh, god. My pants came off. Come on. - Turn around? - Why? It's dark. I'm-- I'm shy. Oh! It's freezing! Oh! Oh, my god! It's fed by the river. It's always cold. Oh! - I think it's refreshing. - Then go back in! No! No! No! No! Oh, my god, no! No! Hey! You've reached Mel. You can-- Oh! Seth. Hey. How was the bar? It was all right. Mel, I was-- I was not a good boyfriend today. Yeah. Was that meant to be an apology? Yeah. It wasn't a very good one. I'm sorry. Like, all I wanted to do tonight was just, like, drink myself silly, but... but Mel I love you, so I'm here. But, like, if you, um... Fuck. If you're not, like, ready to talk about it or if, like, you're too tired, I get it. So I'll just, I'll, uh... Seth. Just take your shoes off. You gotta stop being a dickhead. It's genetic. Dad's a dickhead. Grandpa's a dickhead. There's no hope for me. So... So you're saying if we have this kid, it's just automatically gonna pop out a dickhead? - Little baby dickhead. - Awesome. I mean, that or it adopts your, uh... your dad's bad hair and Orange County fascist tendencies. My dad. I wouldn't be like him, you know. I know. Can I say something? Yeah. I, um... I'm gonna get a better job. You can stay in school. And then after... I'll stay at home and you can work. 'Cause, um...
