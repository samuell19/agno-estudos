This film is brought to you by the Los Angeles CineFest Film Festival, the Hollywood Screenings Film Festival and the Scares Award. Have you ever wondered what happened to Harry Pattern your favourite childhood Idol? Yes that's me. I played in a few other films like Averages A Hard Die remake. Or John Wig. Hollywood asked me to be in a reboot but I'm old and audiences is need young energetic actors to play the lead not a bum like me. Recently I lost my wand. So I use anything I can find to create magic. Well let's try this pen I need to take a break from acting for many years I followed each story every single script and nobody asked me "Hey Harry do you have any stories to tell?" Nope no one asked me that I didn't have a chance to tell my stories to express what was in my mind. So I started to write. And I write a lot. Jessie? Hey, you must be Drew You want sit down? Thank you. Lie. At Graceland. At Graceland I look like I was the world's youngest elves fan Cheers to that. Cheers. So Emerson said you go to a lot of concerts who's your favourite band? All time or like right now? Right now. Maybe "Wolf pack" I love them. Yeah? I just I just saw them when I was visiting friends in New York. No way where? Prospect Park I was at that show. What or the first or second night? It was it the one where the girl ran up on stage and she changed. Insecurity tackled her my God yes. Yeah. That was insane. So we go and ring the doorbell her parents let us in out of the pouring rain and then my brother sees a picture on the mantle with the little girl in it No. And he goes that's her that's the girl we picked up And then the wife the she starts sobbing uncontrollably the husband he the husband says she died 15 years ago then he takes his hand and puts it on my shoulder and he says this happens every year since My God. On the day she died. I have chills look I feel like Goosebumps. You feel cold? Here let me hear my sweater what what the shirt laundry day my orgasm donor shirts in the wash. So can I do this yet? Definitely I had such a good time. Same. Do me to walk you to car? I am okay thanks. Jesse. My God. Okay that's hilarious. I told you it was in the wash I thought was gonna be late. No it just got here. I can't believe you're wearing the shirt. I thing I love this shirt. I don't want to go home yet I'm having such a good time. Well I can eat I saw a dinner on the way over here you want to follow me take a lift Today have hash browns or home fries hash browns they look disgusting this whole place looks disgusting and the French toast is 19 dollars.

Master. Baiter. Morning wood. My God. I put the art in fart. What the ffff...? You found one? Jesse? I forgot everything at work I gotta go Every single one not even a plain white tea? I thought I found one and then I unfolded it and there were cartoon pubes drawn on the bottom. That's pretty funny. That’s not funny. It's insane. Why don't you just ask him about it? I panicked I just left. Are you sure this isn't another classic Jessie move where you you know find the flaw in an otherwise perfect guy? he had at least at least four shirts with the word suck on them. Okay I'm just saying you did dump a guy once because he wore cufflinks? they're strangely formal it's like wrist hearings didn't you say he was an ER doctor who helped uninsured children? yeah and after your first date you said you had never felt so close to another person so quickly. You said that. And wolf pack I know. Wolf pack. Maybe you're right just go talk to the guy I'm glad you called. I'm excited to finally be able to cook for you. Can I talk to you about something? Yeah what's up With all these dirty joke shirts? It's all you wear. Yeah they're hilarious are they? I don't know I spend my day in Scrub's operating on kids sometimes I have to tell their parents they didn't make it it's a lot so when I get a chance to wear some street clothes I guess I like to have a little fun with it that's actually so so sweet I'm an asshole. I'm glad we talked about this. I'm glad you're here. Bon appetite. I can't do this. Each day seems to be the same I wake up I drink some mushroom coffee and I go for a walk The only difference is that each day a different dog barks at me But I want to be remembered as a good guy I need to think about it Meanwhile let's finish this story Good evening do you have a reservation?

What got you hooked? The this might sound a little bit weird but when I was in kindergarten I was diagnosed with ADHD it's made me think and feel differently from the other kids in my grade this inspired me to sort of figure out why the world made me this way one of the benefits of having ADHD other than being really hyper is that you get fixated on these things small things I got fixed on reading books different books about different people's views on the world and it sort of made me realise like Jim Morrison would say that I was thrown into the world this way which made it my destiny to be a philosopher what about you Alex? What do you study? I'm sorry if I'm overwhelming you too much no um this kind of Energies Hot. I go to York for psych I guess to why I chose a screw path that's because you only needed to see in high school to get in but I'm in a sorority so that's kind of memories You know what I'm saying?

Children are probably going to watch this noooo... I need to write something else when you hear anorexic I know what you think young girl teens maybe early 20s definitely Rich parents that beg her to eat dinner and when she won't they cry and group hug and check her into a posh rehab where she meets other Rich Young equally dark and quirky people and they do shit like goat yoga and Equine Therapy all fucking day then she Instagrams her thigh gap and hashtags it with things like size double zero skinny fat Anna Mia thinspo ugly and self-hate maybe in a lifetime movie none of that's me Okay maybe the Instagram thing only when I need reassurance but otherwise not me your grateful narrator is definitely not rich in fact I'm super late on my rent right now which is really pathetic because I just live in a shitty room I found on Craigslist in this house owned by a creepy old dude who looks like he wants to rape me or eat me with a glass of Chianti I know what you're thinking she doesn't look anorexic she's way too fucking fat well I'm in recovery asshole so how about a little support but I am a starving artist pun intended so it's totally acceptable to be poor and spottily employed at 24 25. Okay 26 to 36 it's probably a good thing I've had to struggle so much you know it makes me a richer actor builds character it's going to happen for me soon though I know it I'm a very positive optimistic person and I'm not one of those actresses who's never done anything I was just on three episodes of a relatively successful web series it sucks because I'm five foot eight and a quarter so my weight never sounds skinny no matter what my best weight was 106 which was really an accomplishment but unfortunately it doesn't sound very dramatic everybody flipped when the Olsen twins got down to like 80 pounds but they're wet maybe five feet tall and it's five pounds for every inch so comparatively I'd be equivalent to their 80 pound alleged skinniness at 120 pounds so unfair why am I weighing myself if I'm supposed to be in recovery of course I weigh myself every day how else are you supposed to know how you're going to feel about yourself that day totally kidding I know my value is not a number on the scale blah blah mother fucking blah so anyway not to worry your big boned narrator has got her shit together that's Mandy she wanted to walk with me today should I wait? She'll catch up. So Mandy and our other friend Shelly and me were all best friends in high school but they were the popular cheerleaders National Honor Society life at the parties I was the third wheel who always got a little too drunk at the parties and everything that came with that they were supposed to have peaked in high school I believed those after school specials that told me things would get better after high school when I could be my real self but everything keeps working out for them Fuck. Maybe I'm the one who peaked in high school nope nope no more feeling sorry for myself I promise I already ate Lizzy you look great which obviously means I look fat I guess I don't really worry about it anymore 380 maybe 400 calories in a slice 200 for half wine 140 calories of glass there's vodka in my room 65 calories a shot You are so lucky to be single you don't have someone checking on you every five minutes yeah renting a room from creepy Chianti Craigslist's guys way better. So. Have you gotten a job yet? I know you're still doing the acting thing but I mean like a job job I'm sorry did I order judgment on my pizza? Yeah I have a lot of leads tell me about you what's it like being a mom just get past the pizza be stronger than the pizza another glass of wine is better it's in vodka if I need it not gonna lie but it is just so 400 plus one of the most amazing 270 or 280 plus BMR of about 13.50 so 2150 burned so um have you been on Instagram today? No. Why? Okay I'm gonna tell you something but I don't want you to go on one of your downward spirals then maybe you shouldn't say it like that Shelley booked a series regular on TV. No fucking way. Wow. You both have been doing this a really long time so you know how hard that is or that entitled lucky ass bitch can go fuck herself. Of course of course of course doesn't that give you some sort of Hope you guys have the same agent right Yes we have the same fucking agent. Why would he get Shelly that audition and not me? She's not fucking cankles he probably wants to fuck her or he wants to fuck with my head of course he's still mad at me from what I know showed that one audition that was totally not my fault he's a psychological ninja gaslighting narcissistic motherfucker. Elizabeth you're bloated struggling narrator is sick of everybody emotionally waterboarding her You might think I'm crazy for riding alone at 2:30 in the morning but I'm not what else am I supposed to do I'm not one of those people that says I'll start tomorrow that's how 70 percent of Americans got to be overweight or obese I know I'm not worried about anybody attacking me or anything I'm so fat and gross right now nobody's gonna try to rape me right now you're probably thinking I look like a hopeless whiny pitiful mess maybe you can't stand me right now maybe you're like can she fucking shut up. I get it I completely fucking agree you're worthless fat ass narrator knows exactly how shitty of a person she is You know how some time you have one bite and you just can't stop I guess that's kind of what happened last night but don't worry you're self-deprecating narrator has got it totally under control I just need to outrun my fuck up just not eat today then I will be healthy and optimistic and positive and shit. I will I'll I'll start tomorrow Yeah... Lord Voldemort on the toilet that could work but how am I going to hide his nose? Also he needs to be shaved anyway that was something I didn't know I could write so many stories in less than an hour it has the potential to be a nice pattern the brain not only receives information but also interprets and patterns it I can tell I'm pleased with myself shit. I knew I should have drunk five mushroom coffees in her own time will not slow down when something unpleasant lies at the bottom of your stomach. I'll finish the other characters some other time.
