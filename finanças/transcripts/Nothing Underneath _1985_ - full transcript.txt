(plaintive piano music) (hooves clopping) (soaring orchestral music) (car horn honks) - It's here! It's arrived! (paper rustling) - Oh, you open it, Mrs. Gordon. I can't, I'm too excited. Her first cover, isn't it great? - It certainly is, Bob. We haven't had anything happen around here like this since that 12 pound salmon Judge Thompson caught ended up on the cover of Fishing Magazine. Ms. Carpenter, Mr. Lewis, come have a look. It's Jessica, the Crane girl! Bob! - Sorry, folks, I gotta go. I'm late for work already. (engine rumbling) - [Jessica, V.O.] I love you, Jessica. P.S., I've changed hotels. I'm now at the Scala Hotel. Phone number 311-7842. Milan, Italy. (soft rock music) (camera shutter clicking) (wind whistling) (buzzer rings) - Yeah, what's up? - [Warren] Hey Bob, Warren here. Do me a favor, will you? On your way home, check those campers at Firehole. - What about Spencer? That's his area. - [Warren] Couldn't make it today. Had a little discussion with a grizzly. - Yeah, I'll bet. Female grizzly. Guy'll jump on anything. - [Warren] Hey, speaking of females, Mrs. Gordon told us you got some mail.

This is Bob. Tell her not to open the door. - Run that by again? - Call Jessica in Italy, she's in Milan. Her number is 311-7842. The hotel, ask for Jessica and tell her not to open the door! - What the hell are you talkin' about? - Just do it, man! Hurry! - Yeah, okay. (suspenseful music) (phone ringing) - May I help you, please? - Yeah, operator, I've got to make an overseas phone call to Italy, Milan. - Do you have the area code for Milan? - Operator, I don't have the area code. Just hurry, please. (dramatic orchestral music) - Warren, Warren, did you get through, yet? - She's still lookin' for the area code. Operator, have you found it, yet? - Just a moment. - Yes, I'm calling from the United States. Here, I think we got the desk clerk. It's night over there. - Look, I wanna talk to Jessica Crane. This is an emergency. - Just a minute. I'm calling her room. (phone ringing) No answer. She's probably asleep. - Look, can you go and check, please? - Her key's here. She hasn't come in yet. - Well, check anyway! Please, just to make sure. (suspenseful music) You're sure? You looked everywhere? You didn't see any signs of... - Signs of what? - Never mind, then she hasn't come in, yet. - That's right, I've still got the key. - Room 303, right? - Yes, 303. - 303, thanks. 303. (eerie music) (bell dings) - By the way, Barbara, what are you gonna be doing this afternoon? - I have a couple go-sees, that's all. Do you want to come to dinner tonight? - Yeah, that sounds like fun. - Wanna come along? - Fine, yeah. - What floor? What floor? - Oh, sorry, three. (ominous music) Buongiorno, signor. - Miss Crane? Miss Crane, you in there? Some asshole keeps calling from America. - Yeah, well the asshole's here, and Jessica still hasn't come back yet. - Who the hell are you? - I'm Jessica Crane's brother. - And who is Jessica Crane? - She's a model, an American model. I'm worried about her. I think she may have been murdered. - You're not sure. - I saw it. It happened two days ago at the Scala Hotel, room 303. - You were there? - No, I was in Wyoming. - Oh. If I'm not mistaken, Wyoming is a good distance from the Scala Hotel. - [Bob] Yes, about 15 hours by plane. - And yet, you saw the whole thing? - I saw the weapon, a pair of scissors, and I saw the blood, but I couldn't see the killer's face. - I'm not surprised, seeing that you were in Wyoming. - And the body's gone. - No body. Huh, no body. And yet, you say there's been a murder, and you saw it all. Well, almost all of it, from Wyoming. - I'll try to explain. Jessica is my twin sister. Stuff like this happens between some twins. Telepathy, a sixth sense, and it's happened before. - That somebody killed your sister? - Look, I know that this is hard to believe. But I just flew halfway around the world to tell you about something that I am sure has happened. I didn't just see it, I experienced it, sort of, as if I were Jessica. We've had this kind of connection ever since we were kids. Only this time, there wasn't anything I could do. - Of course, you've already been to the hotel. Did you find anything, bloodstains or signs of struggle? - No, nothing. - Did anyone else see anything? - What's the difference? I'm telling you that I saw it, I experienced it, whatever! (Bob sighs) But I guess that's not enough to open an investigation, is it? Well, if nothing else, at least I told somebody. Thanks, a lot. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Let me get this straight. Jessica Crane. US citizen, professional model, age... 21? - Yeah. Next month. - Missing for two days, Hotel Scala, room 303. - That's her picture. - Oh, by the way, your watch is still on Wyoming time. We are eight hours ahead here. (upbeat synth music) (phones ringing) - In this place, we got the 11th Commandment: Thou shall not miss a shoot. And if you do, you'll find yourself another agency. Modeling's for professionals only. Now, we keep a running report of every girl here. Jessica's missed four shoots, which means she's out on her ass, and don't come telling me she's fallen in love because if she has, then she's forgotten the 12th Commandment: Thou shall not give thy heart to other than thine art. That one I made up. - What was her last appointment? - A shoot with Kento Masayuki. - Motorcycle? - A photographer, real famous. (camera shutter clicking) - Karen, would you mind moving left, left, little bit more, that's good. (camera shutter clicking) All right. That's good. Would you mind moving? - Oh, sorry. Are you Kento Yugasama? - Masayuki. - That's real close. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've gotta talk to you. My name's Bob Crane. I'm Jessica Crane's brother. - Let's wrap it up and go home. (eerie music) That night at the disco, she seemed upset. I took her back to the hotel and that was the last time I saw your sister. - The last time I saw her was Christmas two years ago. Since then, I've only seen her in pictures. She's getting more and more beautiful, but different. You know, like she was changing. Was there a guy? An ex, maybe, who might've been mad at her? Well, what kind of life did she have? Who did she hang around with? Can you tell me anything? - A model, body, face. A little bit of makeup, a beautiful dress, and nothing underneath. That's all people ask of a model, nothing. But you want to know what's underneath the dress. What's underneath the exterior. And you think I know just because I took so many pictures of her. I can only tell you how to light her, how to accent her cheekbones, how to make her look lost, sweet, aggressive, provocative. I only know her through this eye here. (warm orchestral music) - You're Jessica's brother? - Yeah, you know her? - A little. I heard that you're staying in her room, and that you just arrived clear out of the blue from the States. Why? What happened? - Who told you all this? - The porter at the hotel. I'm staying at the Scala, too. Is it true that Jessica disappeared? - Yeah, yeah. But it might be worse than that. - What do you mean? - She might be dead. Murdered. (car horn honks) - Did you say murdered? - Yeah. (car horn honks) - Carrie, are you deaf? Are you coming or not? - My name is Carrie and I'm in room 207. (engine roaring) - Who is that guy? - Giorgio Paloni. He sells jewels and screws models. - [Bob] Any calls? - Lots of them, but none for you. - Is a Carrie in 207? - No, she's never in. - Wait! I'm coming up, too. - I pressed three. - I know. - Have we met before? - Yesterday, same elevator. - Really? - Yeah. I always notice people who don't notice me. - Oh, wait, I'll get it. I'll bet you're a model. - In this place, except for Porky Pig, the maids who'd like to be, and Terri's Yorkie, we all are. - Not me. - But you could be. - [Bob] You think so, huh? - Sure, you're sufficiently good-looking. (Bob chuckles) Whose floor is this, yours or mine? - Beats me. - Yours. - Well, goodnight. - Barbara. - Barb, see ya. ♪ When I'm lovin' my baby ♪ (dubbed voice actors speaking Italian) (gunshots on TV) (speaking Italian) (dramatic music) (Magnum, P.I. theme playing on TV) (boxing announcer speaking in Italian) (somber string music) (plaintive piano music) - Hey, Benji. - What's wrong? - I don't feel like it. - No woman has ever told me that. - Yeah, well, maybe they never experienced what I did. God, you know, every time I come into this house, I see it all over again. - Listen, baby. If you can't forget it, that is your problem, and it could be a serious one. - You mean I might end up like Jessica? - You believe some crazy cowboy? That guy's put out too many forest fires. He has smoke for brains. Here, baby. Snort your troubles away. Bitch! That was the last of it. Listen, Miss I Don't Feel Like It, I'm going out for some new supplies on both fronts, because Mister Was in the Mood doesn't like butts interruptus. When I come back, try not to be here, please. (eerie music) - Yes, I'd like a taxi at Villa Mozart Number 10, please. (Carrie snorts) Thank you. (engine roaring) Hey, wait a minute, that's my cab! (engine roaring) Shit. (eerie music) (phone ringing) Hello? Hello. Listen, you've gotta help me. I need a cab. (phone clicks) (can clatters) (footsteps tapping) (ominous music) (car alarm blaring) (car engine roaring) (Carrie panting) (Carrie laughing) (water running) (suspenseful music) (dramatic orchestral music) (Carrie screams) (intense orchestral music) (water splashing) (somber orchestral music) - Her last dress. (woman sobbing) Her last show. - Ah, Wyoming. This time, we have a body. (people chattering) I've been doing some research into telepathic phenomenon between twins. It's pretty interesting stuff. There's quite a lot of scientific documentation on the subject. They call it empathetic communication. So, I see what you saw from thousands of miles away may have really happened. By the way, did you know that Carrie was stabbed with a pair of scissors? - Well, that's what happened to Jessica. - Exactly. I'm gonna need about 10 napkins. I never get used to eating this way. They really like this stuff. - I was in a skiing accident a few years ago. A real bad one. I was buried under an avalanche. They had patrols out looking for me, Saint Bernards, you name it. My folks and Jessie got there as soon as they could. As soon as she got there, she went right to the spot and told them to start digging. There I was, out cold, so to speak. Later, she said she felt like an iron filing being drawn by a magnet. Somehow, we still managed to communicate. - Very interesting. You know, I've never much cared for sauces the color of blood. - The paper said that Carrie was at Giorgio Paloni's house before she was killed. - Right. He's pretty well known here in Milano, a jeweler. Lots of money, lots of girls, lots of parties. She went home with him last night, but somewhere or other, they had an argument and she went back to the hotel by herself. - So, you think he's clean? - No. But he has a cast iron alibi. At least 50 people saw him in a nightclub at the time of the murder. This killer could be some kind of nutcase who hates models, or it could be someone hired by someone or other in the fashion world. - Christ, I don't know. If you ask me, they're all crazy. The agencies, models, photographers, money, drugs. Another planet for me. - Wrong. It's the planet Earth, just another aspect. We work with photographs, too, you know? Identikits, mug shots, and our lineups are just a variation on a fashion parade. The only difference is fashions are seasonal, murder isn't. It's a year round occurrence. Oh, by the way, I didn't tell you I'm retiring in 15 days. This is my last case. I'm going to find your sister, dead or alive. Hopefully, the latter. (weights clacking) - Porky Pig told me I could find you here. - I'm surprised he didn't come with ya. (Bob chuckles) - Oh boy, I tell ya, I could use a workout myself. In the States, I never sit still, but here? Pasta's too good. - What do you do, still in school? - No, I work in a national park. Forest ranger. You know, like Smokey the Bear? It's a great job, though. I love it. Fresh air, beautiful animals. And when you're born in the mountains of Wyoming, there's not a whole lot else you can do. - Same goes if you were born on the island of Lolland. - What-land? - It's in Denmark, Falster. 5,000 inhabitants, including the livestock. I had two choices: work at the local supermarket, or shop at it, so I left. - Sounds like Jessie. She sent photos in to a New York modeling agency. They wrote back, and the next thing we knew, she was gone. Despite the fact our folks didn't approve. - Why not? - Dad used to say it was like putting a grizzly bear on Park Avenue. Doesn't work. - Let's go find you a sweatsuit. - Yeah. (computer beeping) (eerie music) (keyboard clacking) (computer beeping) (computer beeping rapidly) - You the vice squad? - Homicide. Does the name Cristina Landolfi ring any bells? - Well, it depends. - According to reports, Cristina Landolfi rented a room here. - That's right. - Then disappeared. - Without paying her bill. That's why I called you. But, what is it? Somebody do her in? - A colleague... A colleague of mine was here a couple of months ago. His report says he talked with a friend of hers. A Margaux Wilson. - Ah, the Black. They arrived together, but after the other one left, she paid up and moved out. I have the address around here somewhere. She left it in case there was mail for her. Hotel Scala. - Get my bill ready. - You're checking out, Margaux? - That's right. You'll have a change of scenery through the keyhole. (foreboding orchestral music) (doves cooing) (siren wailing) - Margaux Wilson checked out half an hour ago. - Do you have any idea where she went? - No, but when I was putting her bags in the cab, I heard her tell the driver the train station. - What's up? - Oh, Wyoming. I think we're onto something, come with me. (siren wailing) We're looking for a Black girl in a red dress with a metal suitcase. (intense music) We take platforms one to 10. The rest of you, cover the others. (intense music) - Barbara. - Ciao. - Hi! What are you doing here? - We all have to be somewhere. I'm working. - Where? - Out front.

(soft orchestral music) - We're being watched. No, leave them open. I'm sorry. - No, I'm the one that should be sorry. - It's probably better this way. - Yeah, probably is. Do me a favor, will ya? Lock the door. (ominous music) - What did you find? - Ah, Commissioner, we've discovered something very interesting. In the beauty kit. (ominous music) (dramatic orchestral music) Un telegramma per il signor Bob Crane. - The commissioner will see you now. - [Bob] Commissioner, I have some news. - [Interrogator] All right, Mr. Paloni. Is it true or not? - Yes, it's true. I am the one who gave those diamonds to Margaux. But I also gave some to Carrie and Jessica Crane. - In exchange for what? Silence. - It happened at my house about two months ago. I was giving one of my special parties. What made them special is that I only invite one man: me. - Giorgio, ciao. - Ciao. We brought friends, say hello. - [Giorgio, V.O.] That evening, Carrie and Margaux brought over a couple of new girlfriends. Ciao. (soft rock music) (Giorgio snorting) (Margaux snorting) (Carrie snorting) (woman snorting) (Jessica snorting) What are you doing over there by yourselves? Come and join us. - I'm leaving. You coming? - Okay, okay. If you're not having fun, I've got another idea. (eerie music) How about a little roulette? Sometimes, at a certain hour of the night, when I've tried everything else, you look for new kicks to liven up a slow party. - Come on, Giorgio, don't play around like that. - I'm not playing. (revolver clicks) Okay, your turn. Come on, $5,000 each, every time you pull the trigger. - Make it $10,000. - You got it. (tense music) (revolver clicks) (Margaux exhales) I owe you 10. (revolver clicks) That makes 20. - Me first. (suspenseful music) (gun fires) - Her name was Cristina Landolfi. There were about two minutes of absolute panic. None of us knew what to do. All I knew was that I was in deep shit. I'd no desire to be ruined by some crazy ass model who blew her brains out in my living room for 10,000 bucks. - Yes, but your only problem was three girls that might not keep their mouths shut. - Right, right. So, I decided to shut them up with diamonds. $100,000 worth each. They agreed, naturally. And the same night, the four of us got rid of Cristina's body. (eerie music) (water splashing) - [Commissioner] At this point, our random killer theory goes out of the window. - Well, were Carrie's diamonds ever recovered? - No. But neither were your sister's. - Well, so, the killer probably took them. - Someone who knew what happened that night. Or maybe someone who was there that night. A diamond thief. Or an executioner. - I know what you're thinking. You're thinking if Jessie weren't dead, only missing, she'd be the prime suspect. - Right, again. When you saw what you saw, are you sure that you didn't get your wires crossed? Are you sure the scissors weren't in your sister's hand? Tell me again, what exactly did you see? - I saw Jessica being murdered. - Commissioner? - Yes, I'm coming. Excuse me, I have to explore every possibility. That's what I am paid for. Oh, Bob. What was the news you had for me? - Oh, it was nothing. Not important, I'll see you. (train whistle blares) (train rattling) - [Jessica] Am alive, please go home. I'm in big trouble, must hide. Will explain someday. Please go. Don't stop loving me, your Jessie. (plaintive orchestral music) (ominous music) - That's right, it was sent from this office. - Do you maybe remember the person who sent it? - Sorry, but I can't remember everyone who sends a telegram. - Well... Excuse me, but could I see the original form? The one that was filled out by hand? - It's against the rules. - Please, it's very important. - I don't write the rules. (woman smooching) - What's the matter, won't he eat? - No, poor thing. I don't know what to do. - Well, try moving him away from the window. He's probably not eating because the traffic noises are scaring him. - Why not? I've tried everything else. - Thank you. - Actually, come to think of it, I think I do remember her. A pretty blonde girl, the type you see in magazines. - Is this her? - Yes, that's her. - Thank you, very much. (eerie music) - May I help you? - Interpol. The young man who just left, what did he want? - There is also your sister's bill. - So, what does that have to do with me? - Who's going to pay? - She will. Call me a cab. - You're leaving? - Yeah. Yeah, I've got a plane at two. - You're kidding, just like that? - Yeah, I've got to. - What about your sister? - I've decided to be realistic about it. Besides, my hanging around here is only gonna complicate things. - Maybe in other circumstances, things could've been different? - Yeah, maybe. Thing is, I'm starting to miss my bears. - Say hi to them for me. (eerie music) - Malpensa Airport, please. (car engine rumbling) - Orizio to headquarters. The American just left the hotel. - Don't let him out of your sight. He may lead us to his sister. (tense music) (tires screeching) (horn blaring) (tires screeching) - You okay, mister? - Orizio here, I have lost him, damn it. (intense orchestral music) (doorbell ringing) (window thudding) (eerie music) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) (Bob grunting) (Bob coughs) (intense music) - Aw, Jessie. (somber music) - Yes, Bob, where are you? You found, where? Where are you? - An apartment. I don't know the address. Somebody's coming. - Where are you! Tell me. Tell me where you are! - I don't know. A building. There's a thing outside, it's, I don't know, a sculpture, turns around. (suspenseful music) (locks clicking) - Sure is hot today. (intense music) I bought a bunch of stuff for the house. Giorgio's in jail. But I'm not gonna let him off that easy. Besides, he's the type to get out fast with his connections. Go on, read it. There's the whole story of what happened that night, but of course, you already know it, don't you? (eerie music) I haven't told you yet. Your little brother's left. He went back home. I kissed him, you know. I did. I couldn't help it. It was like kissing your lips, my love. (somber music) (soft orchestral music) I chose this for the curtains. What do you think? Nice, eh? Our little love nest is going to be beautiful. When I think you didn't wanna come over anymore... (intense cymbal crash, swelling horns and strings) Why did you have to go with Carrie and Margaux that night? Those bitches. They changed you. They changed what we had. You started to hate everything. Modeling, Milan, our love affair. It's their fault that you wanted to leave me and get out of Milan. But I didn't let you, did I? (ominous music) (ominous orchestral music builds) (flesh tears and blood squelches) Carrie and Margaux already paid for what they did. Giorgio's going to pay too, but it's better to let a little time pass first. No one knew about us. No one suspects me. You know what the police are going to think now, that it was you, so you could get all the diamonds. They'll be looking for you. I even made them think that you're still alive. (somber orchestral music) (intense orchestral music) (suspenseful music) It's too hot. I bet there's gonna be a thunderstorm. (drill whirring) (intense orchestral music) (siren wailing) (tires screech) - Now what? - I don't know. We certainly can't just wait for a scream. (drill whirring) (intense music) (dramatic, soaring string music)
