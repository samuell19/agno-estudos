Giblets, what's that like? Good morning, beautiful girl. Hi, mom. Merry almost Christmas. Do you need us to pick you up? I'm happy to do it. No, we're fine, we'll get a car. I'm sure your brother's available. Joe, it's Maya. Love you, miss you, can't do it. I can't wait to meet Trent. Hey, yeah, speaking of which... Vashy, Maya's calling from Boston. Do you want to say hi to your sister? Just so you know... Maya's got a boyfriend. What's the brother's name again? Trent. And I know it's no big deal, I'd just thought I'd mention... Flight 143 to Baton Rouge, boarding business class and Columbia. What was that, honey? It doesn't matter. Trent is psyched to meet y'all. Gotta go. Love you. I love you. Okay. I finally get to meet this Trent brother. I've been stalking her social. No pics. Maybe he's famous. I bet he plays for the Celtics. Or maybe Trent's a secret service man or something, like one of Obama's sons. That'd be tight. Maya dating some future president. Okay, A, Maya's going to be the first black female president all by herself. And... Obama's only got daughters, dummy. Whoever he is, he's got to be some black panther ranget to be with Maya. Okay, okay, let's go. Santa's going to be here in 48 hours. If you got 'em, wrap them. If not... Santa's going to put coals in our stockings? It's gonna be okay. We're safer up there, you know? What's that? I read somewhere you're safer in an airplane sitting in your own apartment. Have a scone, calm your nerves. I'm not nervous. I'm just excited. I'm a freaking wreck. It's my first time flying, you know. But I'm thinking there's no way that God's going to knock down a plane carrying someone as drop dead gorgeous as you on it. Did you read that, too, or did you just make it up on the spot? Well, that's the thing about romantic gestures, feels spontaneous, but they take a lot of work. It's just a big deal, you know, I'm taking my boyfriend home to meet my family. Flight 143 to Baton Rouge now boarding all rows. No sweat. They're going to love me. Damn straight. So, that was wicked cool. Yeah. Yeah, maybe I'll become a pilot. You'd miss too many Red Sox games. Stupid idea, flying sucks. Good, 'cause I like having you around. All right, here's the 411 on my family. Oh, no. I know. You took notes? It helps me remember. Plus, I write down everything you say. Kinda creepy. See, okay, "kinda creepy." Jerk. Ow. Seriously, you know, I think it's important. I don't take you to my uncle's pizza party once a week for the grinders. My family loves you, Maya. I kind of want the same thing. Well, all right, Mr. CIA, quiz time. Tell me about Vashy. Vashy, short for Navasha, some lake in East Africa you did a bunch of research at. Yeah. She's 16 going on 30, takes 100 selfies a day. Okay. Pretty good snapshot of the family narcissist. God bless her. What about Joe? Short for... no, Joe is named after Jomo Kenyatta, the George Washington of Kenya. Yeah. He's 22. Super cool, into music like your dad. Trying to get into hip hop. You forgot his stage name, OBG. OBG. Not bad, Mr. Thomas, not bad. Let's see, who we got next? Got your cranky, cute Grandma Hattie who lives with you guys in the house, owned by your uncle, the dentist. Doc, he loves to be called Doc. Doc, right. Who lives next door with your Aunt Dee for Deana. Basically a 1950's homemaker. There are two kids, Alyssa and Matthew. And she's, what, sophomore at the local HBCU college. Wardwell. Yes. All girls, good school, did two years there before I transferred to Brown. And it's HBCU. Good catch, good catch, yeah. That leaves us to your cousin Matthew. He's a high school senior computer geek. Little quiet, a bit awkward, wears mascara. I never said that. I know, I'm messing with you. How did I do? Okay, fine, you get an A-. A-. But here's what you don't know. There's a little tension between the families. My dad and his brother are always really tight, but very different. So, my dad was this liberal professor of Afrocentric music and he married a community activist. I thought your mom was a CPA? Only since my dad died. Then there's Doc and Dee. Conservative, kind of stuff. It's been a tough couple years with living right next door to Doc and Dee. Oh, Renee, I love your robe, so imaginative. Tea? No, thanks, just the pan, Dee. Kind of a constant reminder what she once had. All right. There. Wow, you've outdone yourself this Christmas. Thank you. Okay, thanks. Remember Maya's bringing her new boyfriend. So... Oh, would you like him to bunk upstairs with Matthew? They aren't married, are they? They're adults, so no, thank you. Well, at least come over for dinner tonight. We'd love to meet him. Yeah, okay, thank you. Great. And don't bring anything, I know cooking isn't really your thing. Bye-bye now. It never bothered us kids though, we were all really close. Things got kind of ugly when my dad got sick. See, we supported a liberal candidate for city council and my aunt and uncle supported and backed this republican, a white guy. No offense. So, of course it's fine. So, both sides kin of dug in. Now, five years later and they both refuse to take down those stupid signs. Families are complicated. Why should yours be any different? What? Something my dad would have said. I wish I could have met him. Me too. But you'll really like my mom. She's cool, super smart, kind of intense, but chill at the same time. Sounds like somebody I know. Who does that sound like? And there are the signs. Thank you. You too. Home sweet home. Don't be nervous, just be yourself, and don't mention you're a libertarian. What was that? Come on, oh, my God. Don't be surprised if they seem surprised. Why? No big deal, but I might have forgotten to tell them that you're whi... hi! HI. How much she pay you to play along? And what did you do to your hair? Everybody, this is Trent Thomas, my boyfriend. What? I'm Trent, how are you doing? Sure, okay, please come in? Can I offer you a beverage? A beer perhaps? I got it, I'm good. No worries. Okay. Hi, Trent, nice to meet you. Oh, you guys, this is just too kind. Trent was it? Merry Christmas, Maya. I love your home, Mrs. Greyson. Please, call me Renee. The apartment that I grew up in could literally fit inside this room. Oh, is that a... I know what that is, it's a kora from West Africa, your husband wrote about that, right? Are you musically inclined, Trent? No, God, I can't sing a note. Maya's got a sweet ole set of pipes though. Gran Hattie. Merry Christmas. You look great. Baby, you're here. Trent, this is my grandmother. So nice to meet you. Excuse me, son. I'm just wondering what the hell you're doing here. Gran, I invited him. I wanted him to meet y'all. You invited him? Yeah, and vice versa, I wanted to come and see how the other half lived. The other half lives? Oh, I meant Maya, my better half. Why don't you put down your book bag, Trent. Make yourself comfortable and we'll go see about that coke. Joe, Maya. That is a wicked festive scarf. Maya, why didn't you tell us? That was weird. I'll say. Offering him beer at 2:30 in the afternoon? Can I have a beer? No. Why you leaving him with gran? I was scared. What? Ever since I saw Get Out, I'm scared of white people. Next thing he's gonna say is his best friend is black. All of y'all stop it. Get out there and act normal. You hear that? She said get out, told y'all. When I was your age, black folks and white folks didn't date. Oh, my. Well, they did, but you know, it was on the side. Maybe it was because I married my husband when I was 20 and he was black. Gran. Cracker? Excuse me? That's what I was thinking. Joe? Just wanted to know if he would want a cracker. Oh. Yeah, sure. Thanks. You know, back then they used to call us colored instead of black. I learnt that in history class. Did you ever study history, Trent? Can we change the subject? Listen to y'alle I'm just babbling on and on and on. Trent, is Maya the first black girl you ever dated? Gran? Like it never crossed your mind at some point. It's fine, it's fine, Gran Hattie. Actually, when I look at Maya I don't see a black woman. I'm... I'm sorry, what? I see a brilliant woman with a beautiful soul. Isn't that sweet? You know what they say, honey, once you go black you never go back. Okay. Okay, let's get you settled. You can come with me upstairs? I think Trent might be more comfortable at Doc and Dee's. Momma, what? He is not staying here. Why? Because I don't know. Trent, why don't you follow me? I need to meet them anyways, right? Yes, you do. Please, come with me, Trent. Let's just... its' just over here. It's not far at all. See you guys later. Thanks for the coke. Cool. Maya, sweetheart, welcome home. Oh, pretty as ever. Thank you. And you must be her new beau. Mrs. Greyson, I'm Trent Thomas. Nice to meet you. Call me Auntie Dee. Everyone else does. Come in, come in. So, you changed your mind. I'm so glad you did. Go on you too, up the stairs, last door on your right. Maya knows. Go on, go on. Well, well, well, guess who's coming to Christmas dinner. Well, that wasn't weird at all. Yeah, I promise, they're not usually like that. That was wicked uncomfortable. I feel like a freaking tool. Did you tell them I was coming or exist? Yes, of course, sorta. I mean, I tried. No, I'm sorry. Get comfortable. It's going to be fine. Whew. I just think it's so mature of her, don't you? Yeah, uh huh. Something like that. To think, Maya, winner of the Rosa Parks Award, president of the Afro Am club. And didn't she quit vanilla ice cream because it was too white? Listen, I know Maya and this is just a phase. Trust me. It's good. Okay, this is a little more complicated than I figured. We're going to have to divide and conquer. What are we talking about? You ever go to the arcade and shoot the BB gun? Maya, can we just focus here? I'm saying we pick 'em off. It's like the shooting gallery. You get enough targets, you get the prize. I've got what, like, eight family members here. You're going to win them over. We're going to win them over one at a time. Do you trust me? I do. I do. Good. Take out your notebook. We're going to start with Auntie Dee. We're sunk if we can't get her. Okay, and then? We work our way up to my mom. Auntie Dee takes care of everybody else so often I think she's forgot who she is. Her one secret vice is sports. How you doing? Wow, oh, goodness. Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. You scared me half to death. I'm just not used to seeing strange people in the house. So, Dee, what's going on here? I hear you're quite the cook. Well, I'm making dinner for you and Maya. Maya was right about you, you're far too kind, as if letting me bunk here is not enough. Well, we're eager to get to know you. Well, tonight, okay, you take a load off. Please, you're a guest, I insist. You don't even have to worry, I was practically raised in a diner and I would consider it an honor if I can take this one little burden off your plate. All right, settled. Here you go. Madame. My, this is a treat. After you. Okay. And the clicker. Thank you. What channel is ESPN on down here? I think they got a Hurricane game starting up. I'm not much into hockey. If there's anything else you need. Not unless you've got 20 bucks to lose. Hey, momma. Hey, hon, what you doing? Oh, just packing up some goodies for the food drive tomorrow. Oh, just like old times. Just like old times. Want some help? Of course. So, only five more months until you're a lawyer, huh? How's that feel? I'm feelin pretty good, but I'm not actually going to be a lawyer until I pass the bar. Oh, I'm not worried about that. Found out where you want to work? I bet the Louisiana ACLU would want to hire you back in a second. Mom, they never worked there, I volunteered back in high school. Still. Well, there's always the Baton Rouge Coalition, the NAACP. And I still have my close connection in the United Way. Mom, you remember that law firm that I did my summer internship at last year in Boston? They made me an offer. What, Suffer, Shallow and Mean? Mom. Sanford, Shale and Maine, mom. As if Maya Greyson would ever go the corporate route. As if. All done. He really did love Christmas. Decorations, songs, presents, mostly just having time to spend with all of us, right? Give Trent a chance because he's really important to me. Of course, baby, of course. Thank you. First over to Wayne. Top of the circle, slap shot by Hosington. Picks it up for the Mountaineers. What in the world are you making? I've got pot roast, au gratin potatoes, string beans with pistachios and chives, and for dessert, cherries jubilee. Will you marry me? What? Crazy impressive, honey. And that apron is sexy, no matter what anybody else says. Oh, really? You know what we should do now? Forks on the left, spoons and knives on the right. Like I said, they are very formal. Sorry. Suppers at my house were more like, do you want cheese or pepperoni? Don't beat yourself up. Now, looks like we're one down, seven to go. You got this? You don't need my help? You go shower, I'll figure out who's next. Okay. Greetings, you must be Trent. That would make you Matthew. Indeed. Maya tells me you're into I-T. Say it. Say what? It, I... T, it. I know how to spell it, I don't know what it is. If it... You know what, let's just start over. Maya tells me you are into... Information technologies should be abbreviated to IT, not I-T. Saves a syllable, like ASAP instead of A-S-A-P, or RSVP, instead of R-S-V-P. If everybody calls I-T IT, we'll save thousands of man hours over the next century. Then again, think of all the man hours spent explaining it to chowderheads like me. Hey, this is a wicked cool room. Hey, are you into sailing? No, no, no, no. Water makes me seasick. Things aren't always what they seem. I'm getting that vibe. Lotus blossom, that sounds riveting. So, you're romantically tied to my cousin. Well, we met at the BC Library. That's short for Boston College, by the way. I get it. Well, we're having supper with your folks. Pot roast, are you hungry? I don't eat meat, plus I have to tend to my garden. Well, our loss and thanks for letting me crash in your place, by then way. That's... I figured it out. I'm rethinking the whole I-T, it thing. No, no, no, not that it, you it, the sand garden, the incense, the lotus blossom, the no-meat thing. And that is not a captains wheel. That's a... what do you call that? That's a dama wheel. You're a Buddhist. No, I'm not. And don't tell anybody. That's cool, man. And there's nothing wrong with being a Buddhist. Okay, okay, I'm a Buddhist, just keep your voice down before my mother hears. Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. Buddhist in Christian household would be wise to keep yin yang shut. It's not that I'm ashamed or anything, but... Hey, hey, hey, hey. You be you. I'll be quieter than the sound of one hand clapping. Okay. I'm gonna... I'm gonna freshen up. Thank you, roomie. ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas and a happy New Year. ♪ Whoa. What's that for? That's about two down and about six to go. Matthew seems shy, but he's actually got a lot of nirvana. Hmm, well, I'm glad you're feeling feisty because up next is my Uncle Doc and he's going to try to eat you for dinner. Come on. So, Trent, did you also study law school? No, sir. I'm in the production and distribution of protein bars. Trent started his own company. Well, I co-started. We're in supermarkets and packies and service stations from Providence to Benga. Service stations. So, did you study business in school? I went to Northeastern on a hockey scholarship. Ah, an athlete. Tomorrow is the beginning of our Reindeer Games, neighborhood touch football. Killer, yeah. So, I started as a business major. After two years I just thought, get out there and do it, right? I mean, it worked for Bill Gates. Yeah, it kind of did. I always thought about going back though. Maya, didn't you write about how business drove more people to poverty than it helps? That was in ninth grade, mom. Poverty sucks. The great thing about America is with hard work and a stick-to-it attitude, anybody can succeed. Dr. Greyson, you are a prime example. Well, Trent, it's just a bit more complicated than that. You do know that slavery was driven by capitalism, right? Yeah, of course, my Irish ancestors faced their... Trent, baby, it's not really the same thing. Well, God, no, no, I didn't mean it like that at all. Why don't we take our seats? Yeah, that's a good idea. It's okay, baby. My, oh my, Trent. This looks great. Please, it was nothing. Do you mind if I do the honors, sir? I'll never say no to a man who prays. Bless us, oh Lord, in these, thy gifts in which we are about to receive from thy bounty through Christ our Lord, amen. Amen. And, Lord, please bless this family with a very safe and very Merry Christmas. Amen. All righty then. Let's eat. So, how did you two meet? Last May... May 15th at 4:04 p.m., to be exact. You see, BC has got this wicked lecture series on business. So, I like to sneak in and just listen sometimes. I'm at the library, I'm sitting at the long table. At the side of the table. Uh huh. That's right, that's right. I see Maya, smoking hot. All of the sudden she starts crying. It's true. So, I'm feeling terrible. They call that white guilt. Hmm. So, I say, what's wrong? I had this product liability class that I hated, it was so stressful. So, I said, sometimes the best way to learn something is by teaching it. And we spend the night together. Studying. The whole syllabus. I'm learning about airbags and aspirin bottles, the whole thing. It was so sweet. She gets an A on the exam. Ooh, hoo. Bravo. And so, love blossomed in Boston. Well, that took some doing. I was starting my summer associates position. I take her to Fenway. I take her to Candle Pin Bowling, Cannoli's in Little Italy. I'm getting no where. Finally I pull out all the stops. I get tickets to Boston Pops. Fourth of July, orchestra, fireworks. Right, and afterwards we go dancing on the steps of the steps of the statehouse. No music, just her and I. That was it. I don't know if I'll be able to eat again before New Years. You know, Trent's family is in the restaurant business. Yes, my uncle owns a pizza joint and my dad runs a diner. Oh, what about your mom? My mom's a cop. Oh. And they just love Maya. They just love her. When I told my mom that she's taking that job at the fancy law firm and moving up permanently. God, she was just she flipped. I mean, over the moon. Flipped in a good way. Oh, my. Thank you for dinner. Trent spoke out of turn, mom. It's not a done deal. I'm just weighing my options. I'm looking for the girl your father and I raised. Let me know when she shows up. Momma? I'm saying you shouldn't have talked about the job. Why not? It's an awesome job. It's complicated. My mom has expectations, different expectations. She's harder than I thought. It's like your family's never seen a white guy before. My family's not racist. Look who's in town for the holidays. Hey. How are you? Good, how are you? Trent, this is Shaundra and Cubby. Are you psyched for Santa Claus? Will you be there tomorrow for Reindeer Games tomorrow? Oh, for sure. Okay. Polar Bears versus Reindeer, I wouldn't miss it. Ho, ho, ho. Good night. Good night. Good night, Cubby. You remember Maya. The kid's adorable. Yeah, she's been really good to my mom since my dad passed away. He really would have liked you. Oh, really? Professor of African music would be okay with white Trent Thomas from Boston, Mass, whose mom is a cop? When you put it that way? I'm sorry about the job thing. It's not your fault. Oh, boy, you're right, it's hard. My mom, I just don't understand her. Maybe I should talk to her? No, you worry about Vashy and Joe and talk to Alyssa when she gets home tomorrow. I'll worry about my mom. Goodnight, Miss Greyson. Hey, mom. What you doing? Working. If you're still angry about the job thing? You're a big girl, you can do whatever you like. Okay. It's just you've changed, Maya. If you mean I'm not the same little girl who used to do everything you told her, then yeah. It's this Trent fellow. He seems nice enough. Weren't you the one who told me to be bold, take some risks? For a few weeks, maybe. But this has been going on since last spring, Maya. You promised me you were going to give him a chance. He's amazing. He makes me feel... What? Happy. For the first time since daddy died. When I'm with him, it's it feels like I'm home. Like he's home. That's nice. Really. Just don't lead him on, okay. Lead him on? Don't let him think it's serious. Mom, it is serious. A man who says when he looks at you he doesn't see a black woman? And everything that means, I mean, Maya. He sees me. Me. He can't see you. Is it because he's white? No, no, Maya. Is that what you're worried about? I'm worried about you. Trent is... is a symptom. A symptom, that's really nice, a symptom. Nice job, Renee. I'm in trouble, aren't I? No, they're coming around. Your mom? Well... It's me isn't it? It's because I'm a JP rat who didn't go to an Ivy League school? It's not you. When my dad died, she had to take that CPA job and had to put all her community projects on hold. She put them on me. Apparently I'm the George Bear in this family. You're at the top of your class, job offers coming out the wazoo. I mean, if I had a daughter like you, I would be doing a freaking cartwheel. Thank you. But there's a difference between accolades and activism. Oh, no no no, I got it. It's heavy. My parents were married here. We'll be back. Wow, this is beautiful. Yeah, my mom really wasn't a church goer, but daddy was. You think if you ever got married that you would want a church wedding? You know, I never really gave it much thought. But who you marry is much more important than where. You're going to get through this. Somehow your family resists my good looks and charm? Well, I'll blow them away with my football skills. Even if I am white. It's not because he's white. I couldn't care less. Yet this is the third time you've mentioned it. Have you met my husband? About 6'1", kind of skinny, white. You know me better than that. I love him like a brother. Okay, what is it? I don't know. He's all Boston. Thinks everybody's his friend. Bouncing around all nice and smiley and happy and... Sounds like monster. He's just wrong for her. I just wish he was more like... Like Eli? Look, if you're sure he's wrong, speak now or forever hold your peace. You, you were a walk on at Northeastern hockey scholarship. What is this? It's touch football, this is nothing, this is nothing, it's great. Preser Freden Kay. You got this. Merry Christmas. You must be Alysssa. I'm Trent, Maya's boyfriend. Nice to meet you. Playing in the Reindeer Games, right? I got these for you. Let me get this Let's go, okay. All right. You know, I don't know where to put this. Just okay, hold tight. I'm going to put the cups down. I'll help you. Okay. Good morning Mr. Tracy. Hey, Joe, who's your friend? Eric. What are you doing here? Ah, Maya, I've missed you, too. And thanks, you're looking pretty fly yourself. Come on, Reindeer Games, my favorite holiday tradition. And I'm 3-0. Okay. Hey, hey, let's go over here. Who's that? Who, what? That tall one. Eric. Eric, as in your boyfriend Eric? As in my ex-boyfriend Eric. Yeah. I thought he was in England. Some Rhodes Scholarships only last a year. He's a Rhodes Scholar, too? I didn't know he was coming. Joe invited him. Eric St. John. Trent Thomas. Nice to meet you. Merry Christmas. Thanks, man. All that merry, merry stuff, that's tomorrow. Today, ah, we play football. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Full pat, full pat. Let's get this party started. It's nice to see Eric again, isn't it? As captain of the reindeer team, I pick first and I pick Joe. Come on. Polar Bears, first choice is Cubby. Wait, what? Why did he pick him? My money's on Eric's team. Okay. Okay, Reindeers. Hut. Touchdown. Oh! Sexy antlers on one. And hike. Yeah. That's like hit and run. Look at that. Yeah! Y'all don't want none of this. Oh! That's what I'm talking about. Why didn't he throw to you? Oh! Break it down, break it down. Yeah. What are the doing? They're losing. I'm proud of you guys. All right. You're mine. And hike. There he is. Yeah. Wait, what is going on wit the kid? He's going all the way. I'm celebrating, seriously. Maya, why are they celebrating? Let's go, hike. Trent, you're bleeding. Baby, are you okay? Maya. Uncle Doc, you're bleeding, baby. Oh, my God. Just lean back and relax. Open. Ah! What is that now? Sodium pentanol, some people call it truth serum. Now, I want you to relax and I want you to tell me what you really think about Maya? Seriously? No, boy, this is Novocaine. This is going to pinch. All right. I can't believe Joe invited Eric. He's practically family, Maya, and he loves Reindeer Games, you know. Just like dad. No, Eric likes to show off and be the center of attention and that is why we're not together anymore. I just mean he is a strong, smart, black man who nows who he is and knows who you are, a lot like your father. Daddy liked the Reindeer Games because it was time for the family to get together and have fun. The terrible win at all costs attitude that Eric had today. Dad would have hated that. You didn't always think Eric was so bad. Did you know that after England he went to Singapore to work as a liaison. Mom would you stop? I'm in love with Trent, why can't you understand that? How can you be sure, Maya? Hmm? After what, six months? I was sure the Fourth of July. So, you and Maya, huh? She's uh, I mean, she's amazing. She's not like any other girls I've dated before. Not that there's anything particularly wrong with most other women, but I just... I'm just saying... what was I saying? Maya, stay with me. This stuff works fast. Open your mouth. I think the world of her, sir. So do we, so you're in good company. I just want you to know it's not some... some passing fancy. We started spinning around to you, sir. I'm all ears. See, Maya's father is no longer is no longer around, Her father. I wanted to talk to you as head of the family. Head of the family. Because I got a really important question to ask you. I really appreciate that and I now this is hard for you to say. You can say that again. No, you can't. Yeah. Um. You know, I think relationships are worked best when you've got two strong people that are together. Like two pre-molar bicuspids. On the other hand if one is leaning on the other, then you're looking at a lateral expander. If not, an inter-proximal reduction. And you don't want that. No, I want you to understand something. Maya is one in a million. And this is going to take a very special guy to deal with her. Like Eric? No, Eric has nothing to do with it. What you have to concentrate on, are you that guy? Now, rinse. Am I that guy? Sorry, sorry. Hey, look what else your Rhodes Scholar boyfriend broke. Ex-boyfriend. Sorry. Come on, we gotta go. You can take your phone back. Such a gentleman. Oh, yeah. You ready? No, wait, wait, stop guys, wait a second. Come on, guys. No, Vashy, you can't go. You know the rules. Why, Maya, why not? It's the rules. Since when did you start following the rules, huh? Sorry, baby girl, you can't go. Bye. Maya. Love you. We out. You could have come to Boston. Look, don't sweat it. I doubt any of my girls are here, either. I have tons of friends at this school. Literally tons. Okay, just word of advice. Skip the whole I-T, IT speech. It'll be cool. Just seniors and grads kicking it old school at the old school. Cool, did you ever come out here with Eric? He doesn't compare to you. And I'll show you why. When is my birthday? June 16th, 6:02, p.m. Mmm, Edward forgot it twice. Eric. Ooh, see. I've already forgotten him. Maya, come here, girl. Hi, how you doing? Good to see you. You said you wanted to see her life. You know, I've been trying to imagine your life down here for so long, and now Better or worse? Awesome. I'm just another member of the Maya Greyson fan club. There's no such thing. Hey, guys, come with me. I want to show you something. My God. Yes, yes, this is where it all started. Welcome to the birth of DJ OBG. You're looking at the winner of the tenth grade talent competition. I still think that Olar should have won. I bet you would, R2D2. Y'all sit tight, I'm going to shed a little light on this situation right here. Cool, Joe. I mean, OBG. Yeah, that, right there. Ask not what your high school can do for you. So, Lyss, how's college? It's cool, just all girls. I'm trying to transfer to Georgia, but that's top secret, y'all. Yeah, y'all feeling that, ain't ya? Yes, sir. This is pretty good. It's a bold move with that name though. OBG? Like OBGYN. The doctor for pregnant ladies. That's good. Thank you very much, y'all like that one. Ooh, but wait until you hear my second jam. DJ OBGYN. You're a lady doctor. Trent says, OBG sounds like OBGYN, a physician specializing in the health and welfare of vajay jay's, women's vajay jay's. No, OBG stands for Original Black Genius. An obstetrician gynecologist, that's what it stands for. DJ OBGYN. You did say this place gave birth to you. Throw your legs in the air. And put your feet in the stirrups. Tough Room. Hey, look on the bright side, huh? At least women are going to have to see you. Hey, I have no problem seeing girls, okay? I'm messing with you, man. What do you even know about me, man? Or about any of us? Joe? How many black people do you know, Trent? I have some friends, but I don't see people that way. Okay, so you don't see us. Joe, that is enough. No, name them, Trent. Okay, this is getting weird. Let's just Joe, my best friend is black. I didn't see that one coming. My best friend is black. Typical. Let's go. Come on, who is this best friend, Trent? Maya. Oh, snap. Mic drop. You're lucky. Okay. All right, let's dance. Right. Oh, it's going to hurt tomorrow. I'm just a little bit surprised the way you've been treating Maya and Trent. When Eli died, I had to take that accounting job. What, you need money? No, all my work at the center, all my volunteering downtown. I had to give that up, for the kids. No, I don't regret it. I miss it, you know. And I feel like... Like I lost twice. First with Eli and then again with the people on the causes I really cared about. I feel like I sold out. What are you talking about? You've raised wonderful kids. What's the point of all that sacrifice if Maya sells out, too? Because she fell in love with a white guy? Do you even know how that sounds? It's not because he's white. Race has nothing to do with it, Doc. It would go against everything I believe and everything I've worked for. I... I'm just a mom who wants her daughter to have... To have what you had. More. Let me ask you something. How do you think Eli would feel about Trent? Do you think I'm doing this to spite Eli? I'm doing it because of Eli. He didn't leave us with a trust fund, your brother. He died and he left me alone. You're not alone. You've got me. You've got Dee. You'll never be alone. You've got each other. And you're our family, too. Don't do this, baby. We're family. I know. I got you no matter where you go. I know, I know. OBG. He's hopeless. You know, I think I like him more than Eric. Yeah, he's pretty all right. Oh, my God. I know why he's here. Certainly isn't his dancing. Some stereotypes are true. No, stupid. He is her to propose. Stop, I did not work this hard for you to mess it up. Ready? Come on, come on, five, six, seven, let's go. Yes, yes, yes. Shoulder, shoulder, shoulder. Are you happy? Happier than I've been in ages. Merry Christmas Mr. Tray. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Wake up, sleepy head. We got presents. We got breakfast. And three more people, oh, where is it? Here it is. Four, Vashy, Hattie, and your mom. Doc's still a maybe. Oh, you really are thorough, what's this anyway? No, that's your present. One of them. One of them? Wow! Score. Hey, uh, I was thinking. If you wanted to take a job down here, be closer to family. I love Boston. You freaking chowderhead, you Downey from Dorchester. Wicked. What? You don't want me in Boston? I want you to be happy. And if that means we're moving down here, or D.C., Nairobi, or Mars, I'm all in. And what, you think I can't do a southern accent? Merry Christmas, y'all. Let's go down to the river. Never ever do that accent again. God, that was awful. No problem, miss. Come on, it's Christmas. Come over. It's Christmas. No presents for you if you do not come. Thank you sir Oh, Santa. Santa Baby. Whoo. Ho, ho, ho. Hey, handsome Santa. Santa finally arrived. Merry Christmas, Vashy. Vashy, be nice. Hey, what do you got in the bag, Trent? I know I can't compete with your southern hospitality, but I got you all a few presents. Wow. My, my, my, Santa really is here. Thank you, darling. Mr. Matthew. Bringing them over. Yeah. Vasshy. I know you think it's Harvard, but it's an HBC share. I've got crabs. Nice. Gran Hattie. Oh, momma. She needs that. That got me through all of college. Thanks. Thank you. USS Constitution. What? What do I have? What is this? Oh, a leg massager, oh, you'll like that, Granny. And last but not least, for Renee. Thank you. Don't I get a present. You're later, if you're good. Okay. That is a first edition, excellent condition. I read the whole thing, but carefully not to bend the spine or nothing. I mean, it was way over my head. I can't play chopsticks. I sing like a dying animal. But... This is very kind of you, Trent. I hope everybody likes their present. Thank you, thank you. Well done, son. Speaking of Santa Claus, last night when I was home alone, I stumbled across this. Now, wait a minute, girl, the parade's about to come on. It'll only take a minute. No, no. Look at momma. Merry Christmas, you two. Letters to Santa staring Maya Greyson. Wait, that's me. Dear Santa, I want a football helmet and a water gun and a hippopotamus. Signed Benjamin. Benji, I'm down with the helmet and water gun, but hippos are on the endangered species list. And they're also quite mean. They're also really mean. Maybe we could hear what the other kids want? What a good idea. What about you, little boy? Who is she calling little? I want one of them iPods. You've been pretty good, but only good enough to get an iPod Mini. Wait, what? One last thing from Santa, until white folks see they got what they got because of the hard work of black folks, I'm putting all white people on the naughty list. Merry Christmas, y'all. - Merry Christmas. - Good job, Maya. Oh, my. Wow, I thought that the performances were top notch. Excuse me, guys. Merry Christmas. Vashy, really? Turns out I was on the naughty list the whole time. It's good to know. I was ten. I know, but I just liked it better when I didn't know about this stuff. I felt like I was color blind. I felt like it didn't matter. I like being color blind. Even color blind people, Trent, can see black and white. The day when I met in the library, when I was upset. Product liability. I wasn't crying because of my exam. I was crying because another student saw me reading in a lounge chair and called the cops. What? Why would you not tell me that, Maya? Those kinds of things happen all the time. If you are color blind, you're blind to my color. Which means you are blind to my experiences. Which means you're blind to me. That is crazy, Maya. Human beings, we're exactly the same. Biologically we are the same. Race is an illusion, okay. Somebody just invented it. Well, somebody invented it and now we're stuck with it. So... And what are you doing with me, Maya? I'm not a civil rights activist. The only protest I've ever been to is when they threatened to kick my frat off of campus for having a wrestling match against a sorority in chocolate pudding. Maya, you are... You are next level, okay. You are straight to the top. And I'm just a college dropout who sells candy bars. Do not do that. Do you not see what you do to people? The joy you bring? Ten more of you, there would be peace in the Middle East by New Years. But the lawyer who was going to go off and save the world? The girl who made that movie. Am I not holding her back? Can't she have both? Maybe you would be better off with someone else. It's your parents. I better take this. Hey, mom, Merry Christmas. No, I'm not avoiding you, I just... my phone broke. It was a haphazard game of touch football. If it happens. Hey, Gran, how's the parade? You know, same old, same old. Is it getting better out there, in general? Times change, people don't. I am 78 years old but on the inside I feel your age. You're as old as you feel. Girl, you're missing the whole point. All I'm saying is it goes by so quickly. You better grab your happiness while you can. Does he make you happy, baby? More than anybody else, but I don't know. But, but, but nothing. You better jump because tomorrow you'll turn around and you'll be me. Girl, it's my nap time. Oh, uh, trying to help your old Gran. You remember what I said, baby. I don't know. The timing feels off. Something like that. You know when you know. What the hell does that mean? We need to talk. We sure do, baby. You raised me to be an astute, loving, brave, black woman, and that's who I am. But I'm not you. Maybe I want to change the world by being a lawyer at a big Boston firm. That's what I want to do. Why Trent? I don't know who has the bigger blinders on, you, or him. You're disappointed. I get it. Maya, he compared his Irish ancestors to slavery. He doesn't see color. What happens if you have kids? Who's going to give them the talk? You don't know him. I don't know him, but I know you. And I know you're not seeing what I'm seeing. My eyes are wide open. Hey. What's wrong? I should have told you. And I should have seen you, all of you. You love me? I do. Do you love me? Is that enough? I sure hope so. I mean, what else is there? She's making a mistake, Eli. She's making a mistake. Hey, Gran, it's supper time. What you looking at? See that dog. Every year that Christmas dog is on that lawn from November through January. Some people think it's silly. Not me. I can't get enough of it. All holidays, really. Isn't that why we like them? It's like old friends coming home. I see it now. What's that? Why Maya likes you so much. You're the real deal, Trent Thomas. Thank you, Hattie. You have no idea how much I needed to hear that. Let's go get some turkey. Oh, thank you, baby. You can't have none of this wine. You know you can't have none of this wine. Merry Christmas, Trent. Are you good? Good, sir, yeah. At least I think I am. I was thinking about what you were telling me about being that guy. And yeah, I'm sure. Oh, good. Why, like 80, 80% sure. What about the other 20%, son? I'm thinking she's way out of my league. Yeah, well, son, that's the way every man should feel. Careful. I do, I really do. Shall we begin, everyone? Let's bow our heads. Oh, Heavenly Father, we thank you for this magnificent feast and for all the blessings that you've bestowed on this family. And we also thank you for the fellowship of good friends. And Father, we'd like to say a special prayer in remembrance of those who are no longer with us, as we reflect on your benevolence of this holiday season. Amen. I'm excited. I don't know why I don't have wine. I mean, all of the grownups... We'll get you something later, all right. I still think I can have me a little wine. Your mother really outdid herself this year. Did she really cook the turkey or did she order it? She cooked it. We helped her. Uh-oh now we bout to get into it. No, I just have an announcement to make. It's more like a question really. But first, I want to express my thanks for you all having me into your home, or should I say homes. You guys are wicked cool. And when I first met Maya, I'm thinking, no sir. Like me, no. And... and then coming down here and seeing all of you, I feel like this would be the perfect place, the perfect time to... I'm just rambling on like this. I'm usually more prepared than this. I'm a salesman. Maybe this will help. What is that? What's this? Is that my notebook? Yo, yo, who are you calling a narcissist? I take selfies a lot? Mom? Whoa. Mom? What are you doing? I'm a little ditzy. I tend to think whatever Doc tells me to. I don't do that, do I, honey? Let me see that book. You don't understand. You... this is not what it looks like. Since when did you start betting on sports? What's going on here, son? Oh, my God, what? So, you are transferring out of Wardwell. No, daddy, I was thinking it's a possibility. What's this? It's nothing. Since when are you a Buddhist? What? What? Uh, Matthew, I am... Conservative, paternalistic, stuffy. Just what kind of game are you playing here, boy? Just this is not what it seems. Renee, this was private. Why did you give that to them? I didn't write the words. You... this is not what it looks like. I'm gonna... How could you? Trent, Trent, Trent. Maya. I need you to listen to me. I didn't want it to go down like this. I don't believe you. You need someone like you. A champion, a fighter for the right causes. You never even gave him a chance. Trust me, as much as it hurts now, it's much better than. You know what Trent believes in? Me. The way daddy did and the way you used to. Why do you think I'm so upset, Maya? Because I believe in you. Talk about blind. Have you forgotten what he was like when he was alive? The same energy, the same love, kindness. What are you talking about? Trent, mom. I'm not the one who changed, you are. You are saying you want me to think for myself, but as soon as I do, somehow I'm wrong. Somehow I've failed. I know you gave up your dream and it sucks. I'm sorry. But it's like you're blaming me for how your life turned out. This... this is you failing. Trent, wait. Trent, wait. Trent. Just come back inside. Everything's okay. I'm sorry. I guess I was just soft in the head. I thought I could come down here and be a part of your family. Baby, let's just go inside. It's gonna be fine. She hate me, Maya. They all hate me. Trent, just come back inside. It's okay, baby. I love you, Maya. I'm sorry. What? Trent. Maya. Merry Christmas, mom. So, if you didn't say it, then who did. Oh, my God, would you two drop it? See, the fact that you can't just proves you're a narcissist. See, I knew it. May I suggest we just all calm down, take a beat and meditate? Oh, who cares what you think, you skinny, black Buddha. Spoken like a true narcissist. Hey, don't talk to my sister like that. Or what? You're gonna give me a mammogram? What the hell is this? Let me guess, a membership renewal to the NRA? Oh, an invitation to a George Bush fundraiser? Or a receipt to a box of Oreos? That is my farewell correspondence. I'm moving out, if there is one thing I cannot tolerate it's intolerance. What? What? My forwarding address is at the bottom. Boy, your forwarding address is the address of this house. That is correct. Here I feel accepted, even in the company of vengeful mothers, teenage narcissists and musical gynecologists. Two days ago we were fine, a normal, messed up family. What happened? Trent happened. And his stupid notebook. Why do you think he wrote those notes in the first place? Do you think it was all a part of his evil plan to spring it on you and ruin your holidays? To destroy what he has with Maya? So, you picked a stupid nickname, so what? And you, somebody said you were self involved. Well, show me a teenage girl on this planet who isn't? And honey, your problem ain't that you want to go to another college, your problem is you can't discuss it with your mother and father. Son, you're stuffy. Mom. And baby, I'm sorry, but you are ditzy, but I love you. And you, you, boy, you're going to hell, but that's your choice. Don't you see, he wrote those notes because he wanted to know us. He wanted to get y'all's blessings. But did you help? Or at least tend to your own methods? No, y'all figured you'd just pop his balloon. Oh, well, pop. He's gone. Happy now? Oh, look. Go on. Go on back to your squabbling. I'm through with all of y'all. You're not moving. I can't do it. Sorry for calling you a narcissist, Vash. That's cool. Matt, Lyss, I believe I owe you two an apology. I believe we can talk about this. We're better than this. You want to blame somebody. Blame me. I told him most of those things about you. I wanted him to love you for who you are, the way I do. And we love you, honey. I used to think that mattered more than him, more than us. But now if I have to choose. I ain't never said he was perfect. Yes, sometimes he sticks his foot in his mouth, but I have never met anybody who cares more, or who tries harder. Daddy used to say we are the most forgiving people, because we have to be. Well I want to be, too. So, I'm going to keep trying. Because bottom line, I love him. What else is there? There are 100 reasons why I did what I did. And every one of them was wrong. This was never about Trent, honey. This is all about you. Or maybe it was about me. I don't know. Maybe some day you'll forgive me. I know your dad would. But I am truly, truly sorry. I'm so sorry. We gonna save you, ain't we? Let's find him, okay. His phone is broken and I have no clue where he is. Maybe we can put our heads together and come up with something. Black Shout Out. Will that work? Vashy, you're a genius. What's that? A new rapper. Hashtag #BrothersWhoLoveBuddha. Renee, the rapper Black Shout Out, for what song is he famous? Honestly, Doc, give the 21st century a chance. You might like it. I found one, love this pic. Hashtag #ILostMyBoyfreind. Hashtag #FindAWhiteBoy. Hashtag #SomewherelnBatonRouge. Don't worry, sugar, we'll find him and then it'll be a white Christmas in Louisiana. No, mother, just no. Yo I thought that was on fleek. On fleek, now I know he's a rapper. Is it him? Maya, honey. We got him. Come on, kids. Dee, Dee, you follow me? Come on, baby. This way. I love you. Is this the fastest way there. The bridge, honey. It's Christmas Day. I'm just going to pull up, you jump out of the car. What if we miss him? Stop, stop, stop. Thanks. Go, go, go. Go get him. Hi. Hey. You missed something. Yeah, I missed a lot of things, didn't I? So much for seeing things better. What do you see now? I see the most beautiful woman in the world. And I see that she's black. And? And I see that I'm a big chowderhead. Anything else? Got a long way to go. What do you see? I see my family. There he is. Hold on. We're here. Really? No, really, I see my family. They're coming. She found him. Guys, guys, I just want to explain that that was not... I believe these are yours. I never should have taken them. What is this anyway? It was supposed to be the other half of your present. Go on, Maya. Why would you give me a kora. I wasn't going to give it to you. He was going to play it. I read it in your notebook. No, I was. Maya told me that mom and dad taught you all a Swahili song, so I just wanted to prove I wasn't just some guy. You know "Moja Mbili Tatu"? Now that's funny. Yeah, right. Go on. So, play it. Like right now? Yes. Show us what you got. Come on. Oh, uh, all right, okay. My God. Get on, boy. You can't sing and you can't dance. I hate to admit it, pretty awesome. Well done, son. Well done. This big romantic gestures, they just seem spontaneous but they really actually take a long time. This one about four months. Did you forget about your other present? You mean that? Okay. Maya Greyson, I love you with all my heart. Mmm hmm. Would you and your whole crazy family please marry me? Yes, yes, me and my whole crazy family would love to marry you. All right, get in. Group hug, group hug. Come on, let's go home, son. My purse. She wasn't that bad. You did it, you did it. She said yes, everybody! You're all right, man. Can you move in with us now?
