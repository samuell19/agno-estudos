[DRAMATIC THEME MUSIC PLAYING] - [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] - [CHUCKLING] [INO] Cobalt blue. Lemon yellow. Viridian. [FIDEL] Let's see if you know this one. [INO] That's, um... [FIDEL] Raw sienna. [INO] You haven't taught me that one. [FIDEL] I told you. There are so many other colors out there. [INO] And I'm going to memorize all of them! [FIDEL] I'm sure you will, son. [INO] I want to be like you. I will become a painter and marry the most beautiful woman. [FIDEL] Son, you marry not just because she's beautiful. You have to make sure that you love her too. [INO] How do you know it's love? [FIDEL] One day, you will know what love is when you see colors you've never seen before. [ALARM BLARING] [ALARM STOPS] [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] - [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] - [MUFFLED EXCITED CHATTERING] [CARA] Hey, roommate! So dirty again? And you crossed the line! The west is mine! [IN TAGLISH] The west is mine! [IN CHINESE] Shut up! [IN ENGLISH] You don't belong here. That's why I'm leaving. Goodbye! [GIRLS LAUGHING] [CARA] Dear Ino, happy third monthsary! It's been three months since you last responded to me. I even went as far as sending you an email since you're always offline on chat. What happened to you? [CLIENT 1] I think it's going to look better with color. Add some colors to it! [INO] Rigs. Man, I got this. Sir! [CARA] You might think I have no friends here since I always flood you with messages. Well, you're right. So don't tell me I'm losing one more friend when I go back there. My best friend, out of all people. [INO] Madam Chavez, here's your special VIP drink. Customized for you. But I ordered the strawberry one. Why is that caramel? Another wrong order, Domino? This is not the first time nor the second nor the fourth! Manager! Domino! You are fired! [CARA] I know you miss me, so I'm doing you a favor by going back there. Here's your certificate. Oh, by the way, I am so impressed with your story, that I wrote a recommendation letter to my Filipino friend who owns a media company. Just in case you want to work and stay here. [IN CHINESE] Thank you! [WOMAN 1] Good luck, Caramel! [IN ENGLISH] Flight a-tten-dant. Ryan, please repeat after me. Flight attendant. That's my girlfriend's job. Flight attendant. I miss my girlfriend. Ryan, she's living abroad. She's living a good life there. She's working. She's living a good life there. But I'm not living a good life here. Don't you know what I'm feeling? Don't you miss someone like me, Teacher Domino? Ryan, calm down. Take a deep breath. Just remember that sometimes, you have to let go of that person for their own good. Just give her space. [RYAN] Space? Space? [IN KOREAN] Am I an astronaut? Why would I give her space? Are you nuts? [CARA IN TAGLISH] I know you miss me, so I'm doing you a favor by going back there. Your future girlfriend, Cara. Sorry, I got carried away. Wait. Yours truly... and only yours, Caramel. I swear, big sis, Ino has gone off the grid. No posts, no comments, not even likes. Nothing. Zero. You just don't know how to stalk. Me? I can decode all those blind items online. It's just that there's no clue on Ino's whereabouts. [CANDY] Oh, please. What's the point of practicing distancing here if you can't even distance yourselves from Ino? Papa Bread. I missed you. [CARA] I just need a few more bucks for the renovation. I have so many plans for you. [STEPHI SNORING] [CARA] Hey, Stephi girl! Wake up! No wonder we're losing money. You're always asleep! Look at you. You're not even wearing your uniform. - And the bread! - What's up, Cousin Cara? [CARA] The bread should be here! Why are you already back? According to Madam Queen Aunt Vicky, - you'll be staying in Hong Kong. - So you could sleep all day here? Look at this! Why is this all messed up? [VICKY] Hey, Caramel! You're back! Yes. Oh, Aunt Vicky, I have something for you. Here! Try it. It will look good on you. See? It's really nice. [CARA] Here you go. You shouldn't have spent your money on this. And why are you already back? Didn't we agree that you'll apply for a job there? I wasn't able to land one. And I can't just leave Papa Bread behind. And it's also hard to be away from you. You might even get sick because you have no one to scold. Just try this out, Aunt Vicky! It will look good on you! [CARA] Look at this, Stephi girl. [STEPHI] It looks good, right? Wow, madam! Try it on. You'd look like a goddess. Really? Not really. [CACKLES] I guess I'll just keep this. [VICKY] You know, Caramel, your older sister put in a lot of overtime just to enroll you there in Hong Kong so you could get a good opportunity. You just wasted it. [CANDY] Auntie, it wasn't really a waste. She gained additional credentials. And she tried to apply for work there. She was just not lucky enough to get accepted. Not even as a domestic helper? Whatever, Caramel. Why aren't you like your older sister? She's always on her A-game. What will my Brother Ber think in heaven? I have this feeling he's going to show up... Hey! Caramel! Caramel! I hope your dad's ghost shows up while you choke on bread. [CARA PANTING] Thank you, sis. [CANDY] Cara, do you need anything else? - I'm good. - All your stuff is already here. Get some rest. Sis, how are you holding up? I could hear Auntie's voice from here. Huh? What did you say? Did you just become deaf after being shouted at? What are you up to, huh? You keep on making TikTok's. Don't you have school? We only have online classes every Friday. Really? Papa Ber, Mama Rhems, I'm back! I have something for you. My stay in Hong Kong was okay, but I prefer working here. And I can't leave the bakery. I love you. [KIMMI] At least Sky already messaged you. Any signs from Ino? Hold on. Still no reply? What's happening to you, Domino? Now I remember! He works in Ellaine's flower shop. Don't you remember? He gave a black rose to a customer instead of a red rose. I really don't get Ino. He keeps getting jobs but ends up getting fired. Oh! I just got word that he works at a coffee shop in San Gabriel. At least that's what Simon said. Huh? But Krizzy said Ino works at Rigs' tattoo shop. Then I'll go to both places! What's with the energy? Girl, relax. He might think you're very excited to see him. That's right. Just be cool about it. Let's plan your first meeting with Ino. [CARA WHISPERING] Kimmi, Nelly! I've been here a while. I don't think Ino is here. [NELLY] I think Ino is really hiding from you. - Are you sure Ino works here? - [MANAGER CLEARS THROAT] Excuse me. Ready to order? One Domino... Is Ino here? [MANAGER] The thing is... he's fired. I fired him yesterday. I'm sorry. It hurt, but I had to. [MANAGER BLOWS NOSE] Cancel order! [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] I don't see Ino here. Ma'am. Ma'am. [BEGGAR] Ma'am, can you spare me some change? I'm really hungry. [MUFFLED SCREAMING] Ino! [INO] Rigs. [RIGS] Later, man! [BREATHING HEAVILY] [BEGGAR] Go! [CARA] Domino! [ENCHANTING MUSIC PLAYING] Cara. I finally caught you. Cara? When did you arrive? [GRUNTS] Why are you hiding from me, huh? Huh? What hiding? Like this. Sir, are you still going to ride? Uh, let's just talk later. Hey! Didn't you miss me? No, I won't let you go. Cara, I have something to do. Take responsibility for what you did, Ino. Hey! There are so many people here. What are you saying? Take responsibility for not responding to any of my messages to you. So, no, I'm not going anywhere. I'll go wherever you go. [SIGHS] Come on. Let me come with you. Let me just get my shades. [SENSUAL MUSIC PLAYING] - [CARA] Ino, since when... - [INO] When did you... Ino, since when did you get into this kind of work? You know, I'm willing to help you. I'm willing to send money again. Huh? What are you saying? I came here for this. Oh my gosh. You even have props. [INO] Silly. I have a client. She wants to get tattooed here. [CARA] Ino. Will you please stop avoiding me? On chat, you told me you're okay. Hey! Are you sure you are? [DOOR CLICKS OPEN] Oh my gosh! Get a room! Oh, right. This is a room. [CARA] You're juggling jobs now and you just moved into a new place. Don't you get tired, Ino? You've got a lot on your plate. You might as well carry the whole Philippines! Stop exaggerating. I'm just really busy, that's why I couldn't reply. [CARA] Hmm. Did I offend you when I suggested that you approach your dad? Was it wrong for me to send you money? Ouch, ouch! - [CLIENT 2] It stings. - I'm sorry, ma'am. - [CLIENT 2] Ouch, ouch! - I'm sorry. Relax. Just relax. Cara, I get that you just want to help. Sorry if I did offend you. I just feel bad that you lost your house after it was foreclosed. Ma'am, sorry if we're too loud here. My best friend was gone for nine months, and here she is, acting like she was away for nine years. Best friend? So she's "frosted"? "Friend-zoned and ghosted"? About the house... Cara, it's no longer practical to stay there. So where do you stay now? That 2,000 pesos you sent me? I'll just give it back to you. Buy yourself someone to talk to. You won't stop nagging! [CARA] Blue? Red? Why don't you use it to buy socks instead? Get a pair that matches. It's called style. Ino. Why don't we add some colors? I saw your page. Your paintings are very colorful. [CLIENT 2] Color the tiger yellow. Ma'am, I don't think that's a good idea. Sorry, ma'am, but Ino doesn't really paint anymore. But don't worry, your butt looks fine. I mean the tattoo. It looks good even without any color, thanks to your impressive butt. How many squats do you do, ma'am? Do you do squats? [CARA] You know, Ino, I can't believe I lasted nine months there with that girl. She was unbearable! Ino, that's mustard. Here's the mayo. I eat mustard. Didn't you know? Let's make a toast first. Welcome home. Thanks for the treat, Domino. [INO] Just order whatever you want. I told you I'm okay. I was worried about you. That's why I couldn't return to Hong Kong right away after your accident. Do you remember that? I came here for a week. I came as soon as Jam called. I booked a flight right away. Man, Ino! I was so scared... Cara, stop it. I'm totally fine. I'm alive. It's your fault. You were such a jerk. [INO] Ouch. That hurts. You kept arguing with me when I told you I wanted to drop my course. Of course, Cara. We're talking about Hong Kong here. That was such a great opportunity. Then what? You'd drop it? You wouldn't even finish it? No wonder Ms. Vicky was fuming at you. How was she fuming? [INO] So you won't go back to Hong Kong? [CARA] It's so lonely there. [INO] Then what's your plan? [CARA] Same as before. Cara, don't tell me it's still Papa Bread? What's the problem? Aren't you guys losing so much money there since that huge bakeshop opened? We just need to do some makeover. I'll try to earn extra money... You know what? Just help me with the renovation, okay? I will help you, Cara. I'm just saying be practical. Focus on doing other things. Like finding a more stable job. Don't waste your talent. [INO] Tell me... What happened to your dream of becoming a best-selling author? Silly! That's just a dream. [SENTIMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [CARA] How are your eyes? [INO] Same. I still have two. [CARA] Obviously. You know, not much has changed. Cara, I still see everything in gray all the time. So there's no chance that it'll go back to normal? That's what the doctor said. Can I see your new house? [CARA] So aside from working here, you live here, too? That's convenient! Wow! You're so lucky to live in a penthouse! More like a semi-penthouse. It's still a penthouse. It's relatively small. Sorry for the mess. It's just right. Like a bachelor's pad. [PHONE RINGING] Mr. Gary? [INO] Mr. Gary? [GARY] They need the money as soon as possible, so you have to fast-track the opening of your mom's exhibit. I'm sorry, Mr. Gary. I promise to pay in installments. [GARY] I wouldn't mind if it were only me. But you owe money to the other collectors, and the worst part is, I'm the one dealing with them. I'm really sorry. I'll do everything to give you that money. I'll pay you back. [INO] I'm sorry. All right. Is everything okay? Nosey, aren't you? Any Hong Kong souvenirs? Me! Am I not enough? Looks expensive! Oh, please! Not only am I expensive, I am also exclusively yours! Kidding! [INO] Time to go home. Ouch! No need to send me off. You might end up missing me more. I don't plan to. Just leave. But you did miss me, right? [INHALES DEEPLY] Bye. Seriously? Last chance. Nothing? Okay. Cara. Yes? I missed you. I knew it. Goodnight! [STUDENT 1] Period stain! - [STUDENT 2] She has a period stain. - [STUDENT 3] Stop it! I feel bad for her. [STUDENT 2] Ew, period stain! [STUDENTS JEERING] [STUDENTS LAUGHING] You think it's disgusting? Is it your first time to see blood? Yuck! Fine! Since you guys are so noisy! Wait! Why is Ino included? He hasn't said a word. Well, he's always late! - [STUDENTS JEERING] - [STUDENT 1] The audacity! How did you know he's always late? You just transferred here in the star section. Just leave! You don't belong here! You deserve it. Goodbye! [INO] Enough! So what if she has a period stain? [SKY] Do you have pads? It was my first time to see blood. Sorry, I didn't speak sooner. See? You're even late about that. This one's late too. But thank you. To be fair, it's also my first time to see blood. Last month, when my father died in a plane crash, there was no blood. You know what I mean? I didn't even get to say goodbye to him properly because I didn't want to see him leave. I didn't even get to say, "I love you." Sorry. What for? Were you the airplane? No. How could I be the airplane? [CARA] Like this. [CARA SNIFFLES] [CARA MIMICS AIRPLANE NOISES] Up. Then down. Then around. [WHOOPING, CHUCKLING] [STIFLED SOB, CHUCKLES] - [MIMICS AIRPLANE NOISES] - [CHUCKLES] Then up? [FIDEL] You shouldn't have spent the down payment if you're not going to do the commission. [ELLA] Is that the advice of your special friend? What's her name again? Marie? Dad. - Ino. - [INO] Ma. [FIDEL] Why did you come home late? I was with my friend. My classmate, Cara. Actually, something very interesting happened today. I saw a new color because of her. Something close to red. Are you in love, son? Dad! I'm not. I just saw a new shade of red. Red is love. That's why it's the first color that we see. Red is so powerful, they say, that it can actually grant you a wish. - Stop it, Dad! - I'm serious. There's this saying that if you close your eyes and you make a wish, if red is the first color you see when you open your eyes, your wish will come true and your life will change. That's what they say. But you know what else they say about red, son? Red could also mean destruction... passion... anger... blood. So don't be deceived by red. [ALARM BLARING] [PHONE CHIMES] Yes, Ma. I won't forget. Let's proceed with Mom's exhibit. [GARY] We need to include that centerpiece. It will help reduce your mom's debts and interests. But an unfinished artwork has more novelty, Mr. Gary. Yes. It has cultural value if it is unfinished. But the collectors are thinking of another way. Another angle. [INO] What do you mean? You've been your mom's art apprentice for so long, Ino. So they all want to know... When will you finish that centerpiece? I can no longer paint. And as long as I can't see color, I won't be able to feel it. Then don't use color. It's art. There are no rules. Then it will no longer be my mom's centerpiece. I might just ruin it. Actually, they suggested another person should finish the centerpiece. [FIDEL] Son. What are you doing here? I just want to help. Or you just want to steal the spotlight? Okay, Sky. I'll call you again. Why will you paint again? Isn't advertising your world now? [INO] That's where you're famous, right? That's even where you had another family. [GARY] Ino! That centerpiece will be the selling factor of our... Then I'll do it! [INO] I'll finish that centerpiece. And I don't need your help! Ino, are you okay? Ino. Ino, wait! [EXHALES SHARPLY] [CARA] Ino! [ELLA SOBBING] No! Stop it, Dad! [INO] Ma, are you okay? I'm sorry, son. I can't take this anymore. [ELLA] Don't. [CARA] Ino! Ino, wait! Ino! [CAR HORN HONKING] [CARA] Ino! [BOTH PANTING] You son of a bitch! What were you thinking? I'm really sorry, Cara. Cara. Cara, I'm really sorry. Ino, I'm okay. [CARA] What's not okay is when you pretend that you're okay. Ino, I know you're not okay. I'm your best friend, Ino. Let me help you. Allow me to be your best friend. Ino. Can you paint, Cara? What? I'm so stupid! When I saw my dad, dammit, I'd rather do it. I'd rather do it instead. Now, I have to finish my mom's artwork. Oh? Then finish it. How? I don't know how to paint anymore. I haven't painted since Mom died. Cara, I tried, but I really can't. Ino. So what if you can't see colors? I can label each color for you. I can dictate each of them for you. Cara, it's not just about the colors! Then what? How will I paint if this doesn't want it? Most especially this one. But Ino. Do you not want to do it, or you just can't do it? [CARA] Because those are two different things. If you don't want to, there's nothing I can do about it. But if you say you just can't do it, I will help you do it. Ever since you stopped seeing colors, what's left in here? Sadness. I feel sad and dead. Then let's bring back the joy. Let's revive the dead! [WHOOPING] Why are we here, Cara? Does the guard know about this? Ino, you need to be confident for you to paint again. That's why I brought you here. We're going to time travel. Welcome back to year 2013! Here. No wonder you smell ancient. When did you last wear that? Excuse me! Come and smell me. [SNIFFING] Cara, what the hell? Your saliva! Saliva? I was just smelling you. I didn't kiss you! This is what we really came here for. Our Ecology Week Poster Making Champion is... Domino Urbano! [CARA] See? It's just like how you drew it before. Are those hands or feet? That's a far cry from my drawing. Come on! At least appreciate the effort. [CARA] You're so mean. Let's just go around the campus so you'll remember all your achievements from seventh grade. Huh? Seventh grade? Huh? We weren't classmates yet in seventh grade. [INO] I knew it. You've had a crush on me ever since. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [CARA] Excuse me. Where's the class... Excuse me. Where's the class... Excuse me. [INO] Dude! What time is our practice later? [STUDENT 4] It's at 6 p.m., after class. - [INO] At 6 p.m., not 5 p.m.? - [STUDENT 4] Yup. Excuse me. Where can I find classroom "Love"? Just go straight, then turn left at the end. Okay? "Love." [STUDENT 5] Hey, Ino! Ms. Ong is looking for you! [INO] Here goes Ms. Ong again. - All good? - Yeah. Ino! Please welcome our MVP, Domino Urbano! Give me a Do. Give me a Mi. Give me a No. Domino! [WHOOPING] Go, Domino! Go, Domino! Go, Domino! I don't think you saw our championship game. You were at the wedding booth. You were with pimple-faced Sky. Hey! Stop being a basher. Why? Is it my fault that I'm so lovable? Then why are you with me and not with your husband? Then marry me. [THUNDER RUMBLING] Stop the wedding! - [BALL DRIBBLING] - [AWKWARD SILENCE] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] [STUDENT 6] Sorry, Ino! The wedding's finished. Cara was in such a hurry. She wanted to catch your game. Can't you guys extend for a bit? Make my wedding with Cara happen. Please. - You're late again, Urbano. - [STUDENT 6] Sorry. Do you really like her, or you just don't want to lose to me? Oh my God! Sky versus Ino. [STUDENT 1] The first honor candidates. [INO] Sky. I won't be late next time. Ino? What? Such a coward. Don't tell me I should have been the one to propose to you. I do, Cara. I did. I mean... I mean, I've accepted you long ago. In sickness and in health, till death do us part, as a friend. As a best friend. Why take it back? I already caught you before you left for Hong Kong. [CARA] Ino, that's not true. The Illuminati just made that up. [INO] Really? Then why are you blushing all of a sudden? [INO] Remember the Halloween Ball that you missed? [CARA] Yes. What about it? You missed me so you brought the ball to my house, right? [SIGHS IN RELIEF] [FARTS] [STOMACH RUMBLING] [EXHALES] Okay. Domino? What's the pork for if there is no... - [INO] Tofu! - [CARA] Pork and tofu! Look at this, Ino. Hurry, hurry! - My collection is now complete. - [INO] What a collection! [CARA] Isn't it nice? Wait. Where's our photo from last year? Don't you think our costume this year is better? What's your costume again last year? Where's the photo? Did you see it? Can you check there? I can't see it. The dinosaur costume, remember? That looked nice, Ino. Hey, Ino. [GASPS, NERVOUS CHUCKLE] "Cara X Ino 5ever"? [CHUCKLES] That's old news. So it's true? Huh? Did you write that? [STAMMERING] [CARA FARTS] That's so gross, Cara! Sorry.

I saw red. What? Where? Ah! Ino, it's really red! [CARA] You can see colors again, Ino! [INO] It was just a few seconds, Doc. But I swear I saw it. Doc, will he see colors again? Like what I've said before, if the vision doesn't normalize a few days after the accident, then the colorblindness becomes permanent. It's been nine months since your accident, so... But Doc, the fact that I saw red, even just for a second, there might still be a chance. Let me run some tests so I can assess your case properly. We'll be observing you in these coming weeks. So if something like this ever happens again, please let me know. [NELLY] It's a miracle! Ino will be his usual self again. Your world will be colorful again, girl! Just relax, Nelly. Kimmi, you look unhappy. I am. I am happy for Ino. I'm just worried about what you said, that he saw red because of a girl in a red dress. What if Ino likes her and sees red because of it? Kimmi, don't jump to conclusions. We haven't even seen her face. But what if she's really pretty? Guys, our priority now is for Ino to paint the centerpiece. If that red lady is going to help Ino with that, why not? [PHONE CHIMES] Oh. Sky just texted. He wants to meet up for lunch. The writer and your high school batchmate? Go, girl! I like him. He doesn't beat around the bush. It's not what you think. He offered me a writing gig that he and I will work on together. Now, that's smooth. [PHONE CHIMES] Oh. Ino texted too. He's inviting me for coffee. Oh no! Who will it be then? [INO] Caramel. Good news. I have a surprise for you. What's the surprise, Ino? Um, sorry. We're not interested in multi-level marketing. [INO] Cara. She's the reason why I saw red. This is Iris. Hi, Cara! What an honor to have Ms. Ella's exhibit as my first project. - The Ella Villanueva-Urbano. - [SLURPING LOUDLY] Maybe it wasn't a coincidence that you saw red, Mr. Fine. [IRIS CHUCKLES] "Mr. Fine"? No, it's like this. Earlier today... I'm here. [INO] I'm fine. I'm fine. - [IRIS] Oh my gosh. - [INO] I'm fine. I'm fine. Iris. Hello, "Fine." - [MAN 1] You left this yesterday. - [IRIS] Thank you. [GARY] I see you finally found her. This is Iris, our new curator. And that's how I met her this morning. I see. [CARA] So you think Ino saw red because you're connected to Ms. Ella's paintings? I mean, of all people and places? There has to be a connection somewhere, somehow. Like when I saw your mom's painting in the gallery, it responded to me on such a personal level. Iris was just telling me about how she plans to mount the exhibit. It's brilliant! Hey, it's too early for praises. Don't pressure me. I still have research to do and we still have to discuss your mom's paintings. Also, I still have to do a studio visit because you haven't finished the centerpiece yet? Ino, I think, spending time with Iris might be a good idea. Wow. Eloquently spoken! Ouch. I was just thinking that if you stay close to Iris often, maybe you'll see colors again. Let's make a group chat! [PHONE CHIMES] FROM CARA HOW'S THE WORKSHOP? ANY UPDATES? [IRIS] Right away? We just got here. As you know, your mom's exhibit is arranged thematically to show the recurring elements of her vision as an artist. This centerpiece... conveys the same emotions as the rest. But it's so distinct. It connects to me differently. I also noticed the shift in her imagery. Her, using white lines like this? It's very unusual for her. Did she tell you anything? Nothing. I didn't even see the studies of her artworks. She said she lost them. [INO] But I think this one right here, I think it's a double rainbow. I remember when I first saw this. I was just so moved. [CLICKS TONGUE] Although... it doesn't look the same anymore now that all I see is gray. I'm sorry. I'm actually getting used to it. So... Why are you doing this exhibit? I just want to clear her name. I just want to show everyone, you know, how good she was. I don't want her to be remembered for all her debts. [IRIS] You know, I hold painting workshops. And I use less technical methods with my students. If you want to try, you can. [CARA] Hello, Ino? I thought you were going to help out... [YELPS] [PLAYFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Thank you. Anytime, Arevalo. Shall we discuss our article? Sky? [SKY] So after I came back from the US last year, I started working right away since I graduated early. Nice! You're still the smart guy I knew. By the way, that article that we're going to write is about pastries around the metro? Yeah. And how they're rising after the pandemic? I told my editor you can write it since you have your own bakery, right? You still remember that? Of course. I love your cheese bread. I'm sure you missed that when you were in Hong Kong. [CARA] Huh? How did you know I was in Hong Kong? You caught me. Of course, I'm still checking your posts from time to time. You're my wife, after all. [COUGHING] Miss. Water, please! [WAITRESSES SQUEALING, CLAMORING] - Here you go, sir. - [SKY] Thank you. Here. Are you okay? Wife, huh? [SKY] Why? We got married in the wedding booth. You were just in a hurry then because you were going to see Urbano. Wait. You're still best friends? Of course. Just best friends? [KEYPAD CLACKING] INO, WHERE ARE YOU? He's still late. So these two? You're going to get these two, then... [ENCHANTING MUSIC PLAYING] [PLAYFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Where do I put these, Arevalo? - Just put them here. - [STEPHI] Madam! Aunt Vicky! He looks like a celebrity. [VICKY] Finally, Cara did something right. Auntie, this is Sky, my friend. [SKY] Good afternoon, ma'am. Hello, Sky! - Caramel, offer him a seat. - Oh. Right, right. - Come here. - [VICKY] Give him snacks. [STEPHI] Yes, coming up. We will have a weekend workshop, but for now, we will observe how the lighting changes the colors. This will really help. But the depth... [PHONE VIBRATING] [IRIS] Ino? Aren't you going to answer that? [IRIS] Ino? Ino! - [PHONE VIBRATING] - Someone's calling you. [INO] Sorry. Excuse me. Hi, Caramel! - [SKY] It's good. - [SENSUAL MUSIC PLAYING] [CARA] You like it? [SKY] It's really good. Caramel? Don't rush it, okay? [YELPS] Caramel? [STEPHI] Oh! Cara, you're so wet. [CARA] I'm so wet. Caramel, who's that? Caramel, where are you? [CARA] Are you tired? [SKY] I won't get tired. Shit! Caramel, where are you? Caramel! Caramel! Is Cara okay? You can leave. I don't even know where she is. [VICKY] I like how Sky is so snappy. Sky, are you courting my niece? You guys look good together. She said they're just friends. Then trust that they're just friends. I trust my girlfriend. But how do I trust that guy? That guy is like... an animal. [RYAN] I hate that guy! [IRIS] Ino? What are we doing here? Iris, I thought you said senses will help me identify colors. The bread here smells great. Smell. Plus, the bread here is the best. Taste. [SKY] Hey, Domino! Cara, you have a visitor. The heck? Sky? I almost didn't recognize you. So you're a construction worker now? [SCOFFS] No. I'm just helping Cara. Because you're late. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] What if my girlfriend falls in love with that guy? Because that guy is very handsome, has very clear skin... and is very tall. Very big. He's all that! I hate him! [SKY] Oops! [SCOFFS] I'm fine. What if she forgets about me? What do I have to do, Teacher Domino? - Then fight! - [POUNDS THE TABLE] Fight for her! Your relationship is stronger! [INO] He's just a new guy. He doesn't know what she likes. He doesn't know her at all! [RYAN] Yes! Fight! Yes! [IRIS] That's yellow. This is white. [ROARING] I hate that guy! He's just rich, with a fancy car, and his skin just got smoother! But if you love someone, you'll fight for her. - [POUNDS THE TABLE] - Don't back off! Fight! Fight! Fight! Yes! Fight, fight, fight! Oh my God! Cockroach! - Cockroach! - [SKY] Cockroach? [STEPHI] There's a cockroach! [SKY] Relax, I got this. [IRIS] Cockroach! [MAN 2] Ouch. Do you still have bread? Finally, I've started with your renovation, Papa Bread. Okay. So yellow... Guys, I'll order some snacks. - Do you want anything? - I'll do it. I'll do it. I don't want anything. [SKY] Cara. Do you want some snacks? No, I'm okay. Guys, what do you want? Boba milk tea! With white cream cheese! [MAN 2] And pudding. Uh, I'll go ahead. [IRIS] Bye, Cara. I'll just see her out. [IRIS] Ino, I like you. And I know you like Cara. But since you weren't saying anything, I thought I might still have a chance. But... after today, I realized that it's hopeless. I just wanted to put it out there. So, I'm deciding for myself that... let's just be friends. Iris. I appreciate your honesty. I wish I could be like you. What is holding you back? [CARA] Ino, I know you're always late, but try to get here on time today. We have a major exam. Cara. I'm still sleepy. And don't worry, I can pass the make-up test. Chill. [CARA] If I need to pick you up, I'll do it! I'm still sleepy. Let me sleep first. Just focus on how you're going to pass, okay? Okay, goodnight. [SIGHS DEEPLY] [ELLA] It sucks! It sucks! It sucks! It sucks! It sucks! It sucks! - [GRUNTING] - [THUDS] [GRUNTS] It sucks! It sucks! It sucks! - Ma. - [ELLA CRYING] It sucks! Ma. [ELLA] What a failure. - It's okay, Ma. - [ELLA] What a failure. [SOBS, SNIFFLES] Ma. Ma. Ma. You're not a failure, okay? No. We'll get through this, Ma. - Ma... - No. - I'm here for you, okay? - No. - [SOBS] - [SHUSHES] Cara, what are you doing here? Oh! You're already wearing your uniform. Let's go! - Where's your bag? - Cara! Cara, stop. - [INO] Cara, wait. - [CARA] Why? Is that your mom? [INO] Cara. Cara. Hello, ma'am. Good morning. I'm Caramel, Ino's classmate. Ma'am, could you please tell Ino to man up? He's always late and he'd rather sleep today than take our major exam. Hi! Why don't you eat first? Oh, no need, ma'am. I'm good. Thank you. I'll go ahead. Ino. Don't worry. I'll back you up when you have to be late. Thank you, Cara. [INO] Good evening. Today's test was so easy. Cara was just exaggerating. As usual. [ELLA] I don't want anyone to get hurt, Ino. You mean Cara? Ma, she's my best friend. Not just her. You too. And then you'll end up hurting her too. [ELLA] Do me a favor. Don't fall in love with her. I will not hurt her, Ma. [PHONE CHIMES] [INO] Iris, I understand that this weekend is for our workshop. But Cara's presence will really help me focus. That's why I invited her. [IRIS] Focus? But you're going to book a tour? Tour? Tour? Did you say tour? Well! What tour do you want? [CARETAKER] We have a forest tour. Climbing tour. Walking tour. Mall tour. We also have a market tour here, especially if you're hungry. We have all sorts of tours here. Aside from being a caretaker, I'm also a certified tourist guide. Chief Pong at your service. We'll do it in our free time... Ino! Sky asked why I'm coming here. [CARA] He said we can write about your mom's exhibit, that's why I let him tag along. It's like the stars have aligned. This is a great opportunity! Urbano. Iris. By the way, where do we check in? [PONG] Check in? Perfect! We still have one more vacant room. Can you still focus? Excuse me? I'm the best friend! Kimmi, it was Ino who invited me, and I came here to show my support. [WHISPERING] Stop nagging me. I'll call you again later. Bye. I don't know Sky, so you know I can't stay with him. [CARA CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY] Whoa, one item in her skincare routine? The slower, the classier. Ino, you told me you can't feel anything when you paint because the colors are gone. So, our goal is to relate each color with feelings and emotions in hopes that it will help you finish your mom's artwork. - [INO] I know. - [PONG] I'm going to take you there. Close your eyes, Ino. Give me your hand. [IRIS] How do you feel? Warm. So this is how we'll do it. Feel colors and then you try to paint them. Yellow. Warmth. [CARA] Ouch! Are you okay? [PONG] Jesus, Mary, and Joseph! - First aid kit! - [CARA] Ouch! [PONG] Here, here, here! - [BELL RINGS] - [CLOCK TICKING] Get the yellow ointment! ["BLUE AND RED" BY SAB PLAYING] Do you feel better?

This is for Cara. This is hers. [SKY] Urbano. I am willing to write an article about your exhibit, but I really came here for Cara because I like her. But I never stood a chance with her. She actually inspired me to be better. I didn't want to be a loser anymore, so I studied hard. I learned how to take care of myself. I worked hard. And before I knew it, we're here. She's back in my life. You've been away for so long. And now that you're back, you think you can just get her like that? This isn't high school anymore, man. Exactly. You're right. So this time, I'm no longer just a second placer to you. There are no more rankings in the real world. Cara deserves someone who can take care of her. [SKY] Someone who can support her dreams, who will help her succeed. I am that person. And besides... she said she's single. [CARA EXHALES] [PONG] Hey, Cara! Let's drink! [CARA] Oh, I don't drink. What? It'll help you feel warm. Cara, do you feel cold? [PONG] Hey! - Can you start a fire? - [SKY] Here, wear my jacket. [IRIS] Uh, I'm trying to figure it out. [CHUCKLES] Here. Use a lighter. - Take it. - [IRIS] Oh. Okay. [SKY] Didn't you bring a jacket? - What do you want? - [CARA] Um... [IRIS] How do I do this? Is this right? - Ino, can you give me a hand? - Here. This is my favorite. [SKY] You don't like this? How about drinks? We have grapes. We have other flavors here. Green apple. Peach. We also have onion rings. Start the fire now so we can feel warm. [IRIS] Okay. Go on. Use the lighter. I know now. You want fruits. Wait here. Let me get you some. How do you expect that flame to blaze? You should blow it together. Blow together and closer. [PONG] There you go! Keep going. Get closer. Go on. [IRIS CHUCKLES] [PONG] That's it! Keep going. It's getting hot out here. The flame's getting bigger. [INO COUGHS] [PONG] Keep going! A little more.

Game, game! - [CARA WHOOPING] You! Truth! Is she your type? [PONG] Do you like her? The truth is, I'm very grateful for Iris. She's very patient with me. She's very generous to me, even if we just met recently. I even managed to paint because of the techniques that she shared with me. She is exactly the help I needed right now. Ouch! [CARA] Truth. That was smart! Do you like Ino? Yes. It's a yes! She said yes! And I already told him that. So you really like him. What did he tell you? Because I, myself, have been trying to tell him. But every time I try, he thinks I'm just joking. He thinks I'm not serious. Isn't it obvious, Ino? Isn't it obvious that I like you? How can I compete with you? You're pretty. You have everything, Iris. What do you lack? You're perfect. I'm nothing against you. [YAWNS] You're smart... - Let's call it a night. - successful. - [PONG] Yes. A night. - [SKY] Let's go. - You've got everything. - [PONG WRETCHES] - [IRIS GASPS] - [CARA SOBBING] - You have everything. - [SKY] Why did you throw up on me? [CARA] You have everything, Iris. You even took Ino from me, Iris. [SKY] Pong, get up. - [IRIS] Pong. - [INO] Cara, that's enough. - Cara. - [SKY, IRIS] One, two, three. - [INO] Cara, that's enough. - [PONG] Ouch! - [SKY] Sorry! - [CARA SOBBING] [PONG] I didn't know Cara's such a party pooper.

Coffee? Careful, It's hot. Thank you! Thank you, Sky. [CHUCKLES] I really appreciate this. Not only this... but all those times you offered me a ride, when you helped out at the bakery, and the work opportunities you've given. Thank you! Don't mention it. [SIGHS] Cara. I like you. You were my biggest "what if." That's why, when I found you again, I told myself that I was done with what-ifs. Sorry, Sky. I don't think I can entertain anyone right now. I think you can tell by what happened last night. [CHUCKLES] Are you asking for a divorce? [LAUGHS] [SIGHS DEEPLY] Thank you. [CHUCKLES] Why so serious? Are you saying goodbye? We're still friends, right? Of course. [IRIS] Pink. The sky is color pink, Ino. They say that a pink sky means better weather tomorrow. So what do you feel? Despite the sad colors, the darkness, the pain, there is pink. - There is... - Hope. Ino, whatever is holding you back, you need to face it... or you'll lose her. [IRIS] Ino, you've finished your painting. There's nothing you can't do. Hey, Jam! Just take pictures later. Give me a hand. And fix these balloons, please. I'll leave it to you. Thank you! - All set? - [CANDY] Yes. - [CARA] Is everything complete? - [CANDY] Yes. [CARA] Put the pork cracklings here. The eggs shouldn't be there! Is the speaker working?

Does Cara finally have a boyfriend? Maybe he's just pulling a prank on me. Respond to him, then. Hey, Ino! What's this about? - Get away from here! - We're curious! I'll turn the volume up. [INO] I'm serious. Sorry if this sounds strange and sudden, but tomorrow night, if you're free, I have to tell you something. This one or this one? I'm going with this! [CARA] What is it? You better be serious, Ino. ["FOR YOUR EYES ONLY" BY BELLE MARIANO PLAYING] ♪ I realized That I'm only looking on their eyes ♪ [INO] I am, I promise. See you at dinner tomorrow.

Do you love me or not? - Cara, you're my best friend. - I don't want to be just your best friend. I love you. Do you love me or not? Cara, please! Stop it, please! Jesus, Ino! It's either a yes or a no! I love you. Do you love me or not? I don't deserve your love, Cara. [SCREAMS] I said I love you! Do you love me or... Cara, I killed her! I killed her! I killed my mother! How can you love someone like me? [SIGHS DEEPLY] Ino. Your mom died in an accident, okay? Stop blaming yourself. But somehow I wanted it too, Cara. [ELLA] I feel nervous, son. I feel like a first-timer. [CHUCKLES] Mom, I'm so happy for you. I really am. Thank you, son. I just need to finish that centerpiece. But at least we secured an exhibit date with Mr. Gary. And I won't miss that. I'll fly back here to attend your exhibit. You'll still go to Hong Kong? Ma. We already agreed on this last month, remember? [ELLA] Why? Is it because of Cara? It's Cara, right? You're only going there because of her! Art residency my foot! That's bullshit, Ino! You're in love with that woman! She's the reason why you're leaving, right? Yes, it's because of Cara! She's the reason. [ELLA] See! I am right! You're in love with that girl! Yes, I'm in love with her! [ELLA] I told you not to fall in love with her! How many times do I have to tell you? Why wouldn't you listen to me? - Ma! - Look what happened? She's taking you away from me. She's not, Ma! Yes, she is! [SOBBING] I'm going to be alone. And you don't care. You're so selfish. You are just like your father! Eight years! For eight years, it's all you! All of me serving you, and I'm the one who's selfish? [ELLA] Then go ahead! Leave!

And I deserve all the shit that happened after. This is my punishment, Cara. It's not that I don't love you, Cara. It's just that every time I want to say "I love you", I wonder if you deserve the loser that I've become. [SNIFFLES] That's it. I'm done. I have nothing more to say. You have so many excuses about why I can't love you. Cara, God knows how much I love you. But Sky is... But Sky is right. You deserve someone better. I see. So it's a no. Okay. Finally, you gave an answer. And by the way... no one gets to say who deserves my love. Just me. [MELANCHOLIC MUSIC PLAYING] [SOBBING] [CARA CRYING] [WAILING] Queen.

I've been his number one supporter. His biggest fan. I always got his back. I always cover for him. I've done everything for Ino, Auntie. Everything. If you say you've done everything, what is all that's left to do? Nothing. You've done your part, Cara. [VICKY] Just give him space. Let him figure things out on his own for now. That's part of loving too. What do I do with all this love I have? [VICKY] Why? Is he the only person you can love? Maybe you're forgetting something. You guys? Aside from us. Who? You. Yourself. You end up getting hurt because you forget about yourself. [VICKY SIGHS] Caramel, please. Tell yourself, "I love you." [SCOFFS] But that would make me look so stupid. As if you weren't stupid before.

I'm so happy for you, Cara. I came here because I remembered Papa. I regret not talking to him before his flight. There were so many unspoken words, and I don't want to make that same mistake. Cara, I don't know what to do without you. All the more I have to leave. For us to figure things out. I'm sorry about your mom. I can't imagine what it's like to carry that guilt, knowing what happened between you and your mom. But is it really guilt? Or you just can't accept the person you've become? [SIGHS] Your mom is gone, Ino. But you? You have a lifetime ahead of you. Loving you made me see what I'm capable of as well as my limits. I realized that I cannot pick your life up. That I shouldn't. Only you can do that for yourself. I hope you see what we all see in you. [UPLIFTING MUSIC PLAYING] [FIDEL] Son. Son! I got here as soon as I could. Are you okay? I'm sorry, Dad.
