Monk Xuan Zang of Tang Dynasty China went west into India in search of Buddhist Sutras. His pilgrimage initiated the close ties between the two kingdoms. Later, Tang China sent his envoy Wang Xuance to India. He made a remarkable contribution to the development of relations and cultural exchanges between China and India. In AD 647, Arunasva, leader of Magadha Kingdom's elephant legion in India attempted to seize the throne and make himself king. On Wang's second mission to India, Arunasva led his army to waylay... I am General Bhima here to rescue you by the command of Her Highness Gitajali. Get on the horse. Ambassador, Arunasva has attacked Magadha and the City of Rajagaha has fallen. General Bhima shall escort you back to the Great Tang Empire to request military aid along with some valuables and treasures as tributes. General, the fate of Magadha is now in your hands. General, we have crossed the border of Tang Dynasty. Ahead of us lies a frozen lake. I am afraid it cannot support our weight. Please wait for me here. I'll go ahead to find a safe way to pass. Wang Xuance safely crossed the frozen lake. When he looked back, he saw only a vast expanse of whiteness. Bhima and his men had disappeared. Everything seemed like a dream. Later, Wang Xuance, aided by troops from Tibet returned to Magadha to defeat Arunasva and his 3,000-strong elephant legion creating the military miracle of defeating a country by one man. But, what about Bhima and the treasures of Magadha? Where had they gone? Till his death, Wang found no answer. Wang wrote a memoir titled "A journey to Central India" narrating the events during his mission to India. Later... In his next lecture, Professor will explain how Wang Xuance single-handily overturned a country. Roll-call will be taken. Please don't be tardy. TA, let me help you. No need. I manage. Thanks. Miss... We can pack these artifacts ourselves. You can leave now. Bye bye! You are more popular than these artifacts. Replica... just replicas. Pigments on the Terracotta warriors are mostly natural minerals. Red is cinnabar and green is malachite. Blue is azurite and purple is barium copper silicate. This reagent can accurately show the mineral's compositions and color and will not damage the Terracotta warrior. Come over here. This is the result of our latest research. You will find color restoration much easier. - Hello, director. - Hello, everyone. Jack's discovery is an enormous achievement for our institute. - Yeah! - You can get back to your work. Yes. What's up? Tell me. I just love your no-nonsense style. Let's go... to your studio. To my studio? Why to my studio? Let me tell you. From the Palace Museum Research Institute of Rajasthan, India, a lady PhD has come... Lady PhD from India? ...obviously to come after your color restoration technique. Jack. This is Dr. Ashmita from the Palace Museum Research Institute of Rajasthan, India. Nice to meet you, Professor Chen. Your reputation precedes you. Your continuing research about the Kingdom of Magadha has filled a gap between China and India. Thank you so much. Just call me Jack. Jack. Doctor, how are you? I'm good. Thank you. I'm Zhu Xiaoguang, Professor Chen's TA. You're Zhu Xiaoguang? Your thesis is absolutely brilliant. You've seen my thesis? We published it together. My name is Nuomin. Welcome to China. Hi, Nuomin. Welcome. Our work is nothing without Professor Chen. Of course. Professor, your research in Magadha is impeccable. However, I have an important clue that might help you. Please. Look at your ears! Very red! This is the map left behind by General Bhima. I believe that the lost army and the treasure they were protecting are somewhere on this map. Where did you get this? This was passed down in my family. This map is a thousand years old and is badly damaged. I can't tell anything. Let's give it a try. Xiaoguang, be careful with it. Yes. See if it can be restored. OK. The reason I came here is to invite you to explore and solve this thousand-year-old mystery with me. We could increase the cooperation in archaeological research between China and India. It would also be in line with the "One Belt, One Road" policy. So well said! Ashmita, your tremendous political awareness surprises me. Our professor Chen is the best archaeologist in our country... - So, regarding this exploration... - No, no, no, just one of them. ...it's him, or no one. I'm going to run along. Director! By the way, Ashmita, Jack's guest room here is very comfortable. Director! This thing... throw it away. I'll get you a new one. See you. Bye bye. Goodbye, Director. Nice guy. Let me show you to your room? Sure! These holes are caused by worms or they stand for lakes? We will find out in a minute. She seems to have known we possess this technology. And now, put your right leg up over your head... It's too hard for me. Xiaoguang, move over. Your turn. Cool! Can I join in? There are many Yoga fans in China. Good. Very good. So much. - Thank you, professor. - Good job, professor. This is nothing compared to yoga exercise. - I learn from her. - Enjoy it. You won't be joining us? No, I've been fasting lately. I'll just have some of this. So, you're into fasting over here as well. Yeah, Chinese fasting is very similar to Indian... Au revoid (French: Goodbye). You mean Upavase (Fasting)? Au revoid (Goodbye). Upavase (Fasting). Bon appetit (Enjoy your meal). So, does he always cook like this for you? First time. Xiaoguang, look. Is he always so energetic? First time. - Did you see that? - First time! Awesome! We need to find this chap first. He is the son of my good friend. My friend spent his life searching for the Magadha Treasures and had been for over 20 years. His son might have inherited those crucial findings after he died. Jones. Uncle Jack! Skip uncle, just call me Jack. Jack. Look at you. Haven't seen you all these years. Now you look just like your dad. When I was little, didn't you say I was better looking than my dad? You are a smart-aleck like your dad, for sure. No, I am not like him. You are both archaeologists. I am only a treasure hunter. Your dad also thought he was hunting for treasures. It seems you want to finish off what he started. On the phone, you said you have a nice surprise for me. What is it? Come with me. Jones, the son of a good friend. - Hello. - Hi! This is Dr. Ashmita. It's a real pleasure. Nice to meet you. - Jones, this is my... - Let me guess. You must be Dr. Ashmita's assistant? Teaching assistant. May I have the pleasure of knowing your name? I'm Kyra. It's a very pretty name. Thank you. Look at you. You face is turning red. Professor... My assistant. How are you? I am Nuomin. - Nice to meet you. - Hi! Where is Xiaoguang? Xiaoguang! Hi, I am Xiaoguang. Do you remember the treasure your father was searching for his entire life? Here is the treasure map. Doctor brought it from India. No. Really? Wait... If you want to have a good look at it, we can work together. Archaeology... Treasure hunting... That's not hunting treasures. You raid tombs, which is illegal. What did you guys just say? Think about it. This is the chance to prove that your father gave his life for something more than just a legend. Here we are. This gold coin was found by my father on these very river banks some 10 years ago. He led an exploration team down this river, but unfortunately, he was the only one who returned. My old man always believed this gold coin was somehow connected to the Magadha he tried to find. I've been doing years of research, and I still haven't found the missing link. May I have a look at it? Please. Thank you. It's not just a gold coin. This is Bhima's family emblem. You see these 3 holes? This is for attaching it to the armor. This must have belonged to General Bhima! When General Bhima and Wang Xuance got separated in the snowstorm, Bhima and his men took shelter in a cave. However, an avalanche hit and they all got trapped inside. General Bhima must have escaped and then drawn the map! If this is true, it should be upstream from here. Xiaoguang, you two go check the temperature of the water temperature. Yes, professor. OK. Let's go up to see which mountain is avalanche prone. - Okay? - OK. Let's go. Xiaoguang, scan the surrounding terrain. Well, according to your coordinates, it's just 3 hours upstream and you'll find the entrance to the Twin Dragon River, underwater passage. This is as far as the drone can go. You are on your own now. Keep it up! - And be safe. - Good luck! Xiaoguang, we are near the headstream of the Twin Dragon River. Got it. This is it. Xiaoguang, we arrived. Great! Little yellow fish, let's see what you can do. Here we go. Oh, my God! That is so cool! Yeah! Let's get her in the water. Okay. Professor. Here are images of the underground river sent back by Jones' robofish. Stop! Look. There's a space above the surface. Yeah! Can you find its location? Yes. Uncle Jack. Under the blue flag is the subterranean space I discovered. About 1 km away from the outlet of Twin Dragon River's underground water. If Bhima really came out from there, he must have been under the freezing water at least 7 minutes. It's impossible without diving gear. No. It's the Fetal Breath-Holding technique in yoga. Don't forget, before we were born, we all spent 9 months in our mothers' bellies. It's not that human beings can't survive under water, it's just that we've forgotten our ability to do so. World champion free divers can hold their breath for more than 8 minutes. They all practice yoga. Hi, Jack! Long time no see. What gives? Want to ask you for a favor. What is it? I am in the Kunlun Mountains... Near the border of China and India? Right. What do you need? Drill a hole. A hole for oil? Not a hole for oil. A hole in ice. Ice hole? We happen to have new equipment for that. I might have found some treasures. Treasure of what? Of ancient India's Magadha Kingdom. You wouldn't know about it. We'll talk when you get here. - OK, see you in 3 days. - Good. What else? Maybe a message. If only we could put in some chili pepper. Professor, this Tibetan tea smells really good. Try it. - Thanks. - You are welcome. Thanks. - It smells really good. - Thank you. Hey, can you hear it? The alpha wolf is calling his mates. Where? Don't move. Right behind you. I see them. Two over there. The rest are behind the glacier. Jones. Come. Where are we going? Meet the wolves. We must strike first. Xiaoguang... hold the fort. I am in charge now? It sounds like fun. I am going too. Remember... Wait up! We must be meaner than them. Where are they going? They are looking for wolves. We are on their turf now. Wolves' turf! We are here to kick ass! Kick ass! Kid... Remember the kung fu I taught you when you were little? Of course, even the mnemonic chant. Recite them to me. "Heart, mind, energy merge to become 3 internal unions." "Fist & foot, elbow & knee, shoulder & hip merge as 3 external unions." "Avoid long-range raids and attack only within striking distance." "Hit where needed without forewarning." Knowing the chant is not enough. Have you been practising? Sometimes. Sometimes means no. Why not? Couldn't find a worthy partner. Just listen to yourself. This is why I think you are like your dad. I'll practise with you. Showing off to the wolves. OK. I'm going to teach you another chant. "When upper body moves, the lower echoes." - "Upper body moves..." - Here it comes! Powerful grip! Impressive! Come! "When lower body moves, the upper leads." Also, "When upper and lower bodies move, waist moves forward." "When waist moves, the upper and lower bodies conform." "Let your body and the environment be one." "Strike with accuracy." "Move with swiftness." You kid! What was that move? Use your brain! Good. "Hit the throat above and the groin below." You did that in opposite order! Sorry, I got them mixed up. "Ten feet ahead is not too far to strike." "A close hit..." Loosen up. "...is within an inch." You say one thing and do another. I'd rather you just fight and say nothing. Hey, kid, you did okay. Get up. Get up. Chinese kung fu has it roots deep in the Chinese culture. There is a lot more for you to learn. When I go back, I should also read up. The wolf is eyeing me. You two come over and fight here. Never mind him. Let's go. Where are you going? Wait for me... Wait for me! Let's go. You leave him there? Don't worry. He will find a way down. Xiaoguang, I told you to keep an eye on them. Professor, since you went to catch the wolves, I had them make a few snowmen to scare off the wolves. Scare the wolves? - Yes. - Wolves are coming! Help! Quick! Grab snowballs! Go! The wolves are coming! Scare them away! Go! They are at my butt, hurry! One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. Your meaty thigh alone can feed the whole pack of wolves for 3 years! Ashmita's in China and it looks like they found the location. So, the men are keeping a very close eye on them. By the grace of God, we'll finally get that which is rightfully ours. And the honor of our ancestors will be restored... ...once and for all! Higher! It's incredible. Yeah. That's unbelievable. Amazing. Modern technology really rocks. Careful. Watch out. Good luck. I'll be fine. Watch your head. It's beautiful down here. Bring the equipment down. Yes, copy that. Right away. Found the vanished Magadha treasures for the Tang Dynasty in AD 647. The location is about 30 meters under the ice surface, inside a huge ice cave. Another tremendous discovery of yours. Congratulations. You are a part of it. Hands up! Stop! Move it! Get over there! Watch it. The water from the melted glaciers in the course of its movement creates an ice lake. This is an en-glacial river. Through this river, we found this site. General Bhima and his men must have found this cave while taking shelter from that snow storm. The avalanche hit, they all got trapped inside. With the clothes they were wearing, would have frozen to death in no time. What is this thing? I may have found the remains of the Magadha soldiers. Hold it for me. No. Take it. We are archaeologists, this is nothing to get scared of. No big deal! What do you see? The bodies are still intact because they are frozen. Are you scared? I am here. Nothing to be afraid of. It's real gold. This is Magadha gold coin. Kyra, what's that piece of ice you're trying to kill? It's just Bhima's... headrest. His headrest? Thirteen cases of gold. Don't move! Get down. No one fires! Get up! Come here! Easy. Some call it "destiny". Some may call it "meant to be". But I call it... I make it happen. Who's he? It's not important for you to know who I am. What's important is to know everything here belongs to my ancestors. Who's this guy? He's the 79th... Don't get into history. Get into the facts, and... Everything here belongs to the Gitanjali family. No! Everything here, according to the law, belongs to the government. In here, I'm the government. Bring all the treasure up. Tie them up and let them freeze to death. Yes, boss. Go! Go! Go! Jack! Put the gun away! He's just a professor. Go! Go! Come! What are you hiding? Nothing. - Check her out. - OK. Go! Go! Give it to me. - Go! Go! Go! - OK! Jones! Stop! Don't move! Oh my God! Thanks. - Come on. - OK. Stop right there! Make sure no one comes out alive. - Yes, boss! - Seal them off. Professor, we will freeze to death. Xiaoguang, there's a knife next to you. Grab it with your teeth. Toss it to me. Are... are you sure? Archaeologists often deal with human remains. What's to fear? He's been dead for 1,300 years. I am considering finding a new job. No need! Yoga. Can you do it? Of course! My arm... Don't do it. Jack. Yes. Let the breath move up the spine, from the perineum to the Third Eye. Let your lungs fill with air, but focus on the Third Eye. Now release the breath. Let it flow back down the spine. Feel the spine guide the body. Inhale... ...Exhale. Inhale... ...Exhale. Got it? Not really. I'll do it my own way. OK. After you. Come on, Jack. Just... just one more step. Jack. You okay? What? Jack! What? Your stomach? Jack! What? Yes, OK! OK! OK! OK! I'm going to look for help. Just stay. I'll be back. Professor Chen. The results indicate that your health is back to normal. But we recommend you stay in the hospital a few more days for observations. OK, thank you. You are welcome. Professor. Director Liu is here. - Professor Chen. - Director Liu, good to see you. Please sit. Professor Chen. You successfully found the Magadha treasures en route to the Tang Dynasty. Another feat for archaeology of China and the whole world! To unearth cultural relics and treasures is our job. Did you catch those raiders? Our police intercepted and arrested them on the highway. Look! Here are the greetings from leading officials. Take you time to read them. I have to hurry back to the location. I still have some urgent matters to take care of. Get some rest. Appreciate your hard work. OK! Goodbye! - OK. Thanks. - Take care of him. Thank you. Bye. Professor, so many high ranking officials sent you get-well-soon greetings, ah? That's not what matters. What matters is we have fulfilled Wang Xuance's wish. Found the soldiers who went through the ordeal with him. They are nameless fighters, but they are all witnesses to history. Professor! Look! What? Diamond of Magadha is to be auctioned in Dubai next week. Ashmita forwarded that to me. Professor, she left you a message. Jack, It's not just a diamond. It's the key that unlock the Magadha treasures. We must get it back. Ashmita. Jones has committed a crime of theft. We need to get back the diamond and return it before too late. Jack, see how well connected I am in the UAE? When I told the prince you were my buddy, then what happened? He immediately invited you to the camel races. He even personally drives us. Don't just staring out. Thank the Prince. Thank you Your Highness for your hospitality. You're welcome. Look, the one with a red tag is my dad's camel. The one with a black tag is the Prince's. What is the prize for winning the race? You see those cars? How much is one of those? The winner get to drive away one of those. You family must have won many cars before. My dad's camel has never won yet. Faster! Faster! Faster! What is the remote control for? For the whipping. You see? There's a whip. Hey pal, I'm not here for vacation. I know. Tomorrow, you must win the bid for the diamond for me. Go! Go! Don't worry. Everything is set. Guarantee to get it. It is speeding up! Your camel is foaming at the mouth and moving up. My camel is catching up! Faster! Red! Red! It's overtaking! Go! Faster! I finally won! Fantastic! I finally won! Xiaoguang, where are you? By the pool. I don't see him here. What about you? I found Jones. Come over quickly. Right away. This big? How do you wear it? It's not that big. The one recently mined is 2 times bigger. That's a rough stone. This way please. Thank you. Ladies and Gentlemen. Welcome to today's auction. The diamond that we are about to bid on today is a staggering 212-carat one-of-a-kind treasure. Do you have to wear so skimpy? Everyone wears swimsuit on the beach. What's wrong with mine? I don't care what other people wear. But I have a problem with what you're wearing. Why are you blushing again? 90 million dollars, lady in the corner. Thank you very much. - Raise it. - 90 million dollars. We are already to 100 million dollars to the young lady in white. One hundred and ten right here in the corner. 110 million dollars! Do I hear 120? 120 million dollars? - Again. - We've got 110 right now. 120 million dollars! Thank you very much! Just a second. What? Hope nobody bids again. I don't think so, already too high. 130 million dollars! It's the Prince, dad. The Prince? Dad's friend. We've got 130. Do I hear 140? The Prince is also here. Just tell him not to bid. He has more money than me. We don't have enough money in the account. I don't care! I want the diamond! No more bidding. 150 million dollars! Gentlemen in the corner. 150 million dollars. Dad, 150 now! We don't bid anymore. Consider it a favor to me. What favor? If it were 1.5 million, I can help you. Now, we are talking about 150 million. It's the key to the treasures... I know you are the best archaelogist. Can you guarantee that you will find the treasures? 160 million dollars! Lady in the white! Who told you to raise the placard? Just now, didn't you tell me to hold it up? I... Jack! No, listen to me. This is the diamond of Magadha Kingdom. It's also the key to the treasure. I don't want to hear it! Just wait. Maybe someone will make a bid. Sold! Dad, you are so posh! 160 million dollars! Oh my God! Everybody! Everybody! Party... on me! Tonight! Randall has been outbid. I'll keep an eye on him. OK. Sorry, sorry, sorry, everybody. The party is over. Why didn't you tell me you were coming? We finally found you! Sorry guys, party's over. See you guys tonight! Moon Island on me, yeah? Oh man! Sorry brother, I know. I'm sorry. Why did you steal the diamond? You said you only wanted to fulfill your dad's wish and nothing else? You archaeologists, don't you want an item from the past to see the light again, so people can treasure and preserve it? The present buyer will surely treasure it because he paid a huge price for it. Stop finding excuses. If we don't bring the diamond back, because of you, professor will have to take the blame for stealing cultural relics. Don't worry. Perhaps we will find the secret behind the diamond. Now you say "perhaps." That won't do. What are you guys doing here? None of your business! Listen to me... Why are you fighting? - You, come here! - What do you want! - What's going on? - What do you think? Hand... Dad! Jack! Jack! They are taking my stuff! Jack! Help! Watch out! My hand... Jack! Come on! Jack! Hit this low life! My hand... Go! Don't hit me! For you! For you! I'll get the key. - I'm unlocking it! Jack! - Shut up! - I'm opening it! - Just open it! - I'm opening it! - Shut up! - I'm opening it! It's opened! - Just open it! Girl, grab the box and run! Hurry! Dad! Don't give it to me! Take it! Run! - Give me that! - Don't hit me! For you. My heart! Dad! - How's your heart? - Dad! Go! How's your heart? You broke my heart! Take care of your father! Dad, you OK? My 160 million dollars! Stop! They took the diamond! Professor is chasing after them! - What? - They are at the lobby! - Let's go. Quick! - Come quickly to the entrance! Boss! Go! Go! Get in! Just go! Hold on please. Line up and follow each other. What's wrong with you! Excuse me. Sorry! Professor! What's wrong with you! Come back! - Where to find a car? - Find a car! Find a car... Park it well. Where did they go? We have a car! Quick! - You know how to drive it? - Go find your own car, quick! I have a car! - Great! Go! - That one! Calling station, two supercars are speeding in the wrong direction. You must be "kitty"... ["kidding" sound-alike] Do you understand Mandarin? Brother, what's your name? Patrol 511, multiple cars are speeding along Sheikh Zayed Road in the wrong direction. Head towards Abdullah Street to block them. Hold on! Just hit it! You okay? You speak English? Calling station, the Hummer is armed. We are heading towards Marina Bay. Xiaoguang, step on it! Be careful! Don't panic... Don't panic... What are you trying to do? My car... The door! Come help me step on the gas pedal. What else are you trying to do? To get back the diamond for your dad. OK! Take it easy brother. Peace be upon you. Don't get mad! No matter what! Jack! I got it. Good job! Patrol 511, road block has been setup at the intersection bridge. Shit! Professor! A big Tibetan Mastiff! Lion! - Is it a lion? - It's a lion! Nice kitty. Jackie? Same name as me? Little Jackie! Little Jackie! Little Jackie! Uncle Jack! Uncle Jackie... Little Jackie! Little Jackie! Little Jackie! Jackie! Where is the diamond? We lost it again! Don't get off the car. Little Jackie! How are you? A 160-million-dollar rock went up in smoke just like that. Look! Kid... When will you transfer the money back to my account? I saw the one on the motorbike who took the diamond. It was Ashmita! She set us all up. Never expected her to be a bad person. It's hard to say yet who is bad or good. A person must be responsible for his or her own action. Give the money back quickly. This is what I like to hear. You heard it? Even if you pay me back the 1.6 million, that auction still has a huge commission fee. I am still losing money. I'll go to India to find her. I need to report this to the police. No idea how much more to pay for damages. Any progress on Xiaoguang's and Jones' visas? They just got theirs. Will be here tomorrow. The hall is divided into 3 parts, and consists of 9 bold arches. They used red sandstone and is plastered with white shell plaster. - Jiang Wen, it's been awhile! - Nuomin! Professor, this is Jiang Wen. Professor, how are you? Hi, foreign student here? Yes, I'm from Beijing, doing postgraduate research in history. I'm also Professor Ashmita's Chinese tutor. Excuse me, Doctor. Professor Chen from China. Please to meet you. Honour to meet you. Nice meeting you! And you've come all the way from China. Yes. Is that you? Yes, that's very much me. But the one I met in China... I know who you're talking about! Class, dismissed! Thank you, Madam. Please come, come with me. This way, please. In order to find you, she had to pretend to be me. Truthfully, she is the 68th generation descendant of Princess Gitanjali of Magadha. Princess? This garden is really big. She lives here by herself? Wonderful! Here comes our Princess, Professor Chen. Professor. Say something. Welcome to India, Jack. There's no need for that, I've come for the diamond, Princess. Jack, thank you for helping me find it. I know what I did was wrong and I'm sorry. But I had no other way of making sure you'd come to India. After all, you're China's greatest archaeologist. Just one of them. Would you mind coming over? Sure. Please sit. Jack. Meet my sister. She's not your assistant? No. I'm the younger sister. - Hello. - Hello. Jack, we need you... Help us use the diamond to solve the mystery of the Magadha treasure. What's so special about this diamond? Jiang Wen, could you please explain it to him in Chinese? My pleasure. Eye of Shiva, whoever possesses it shall possess the entire world. After Shiva was reincarnated, her Third Eye remained in the mortal world. Legend has it that it is the key to Magadha imperial treasures. A thousand years ago, Arunasva mutinied and usurped the throne. What he was really after was the imperial treasures. This diamond was most vital to him. Who's that guy in the ice cave and Dubai? Why does he want the diamond too? That's Randall. The last descendant of Arunasva. Are there any other clues? Yes. Ever since this diamond was mined, it was set on the scepter that symbolized Magadha's supreme power. Diamond and scepter were one in unity. But, how does it open the door to the treasures? We're still trying to figure that out. Jack, do you like your outfit? Yes. Just... Just a little bit tight. Um... It's time to pick up Jones. Right, you'd better hurry. We'll contact each other later. OK. See you. This is the clue I was talking about. This is the Amala Temple. It was built during the Vedic period. Legend says that the Magadha treasure is somewhere inside one of the 27 temples. Every year during the festival of the Sun God, the "Path of the Light" is revealed. I'm sure if we could find the pathway, it will lead us to the treasure. The festival is tomorrow. Vedic designers made temples according to astronomical principles. There's a book about this. We can start from there. "Vastu Shastra". The oldest book ever written about architectural design. And I know where to find it. Strange. What? Why isn't it centered? In ancient India, people combined architecture and astronomy. What is King Harsha's zodiac sign? Gemini. Wait! Look! That's Amala Temple. Look! The lines match up with constellation Draco! See! So, it means it's not Gemini. "Thuban." What's that mean? It means the head of the serpent. The northern pole star of the constellation Draco. I think the path to the Magadha treasure is located at the temple that matches the star. But according to the map, it's the smallest temple. King Harsha might have done this to hide something. That's a good guess. But we still need to prove it. Wait, let me take a photo. OK. Ashmita and professor have found some clue and want us to meet them here. This is the most popular local bazaar with traditional performing artists. That dude will surely get a sore throat. I know about this one. That is the... Indian rope trick. You seem to know quite a lot. This is a traditional trick handed down from ancient India. When Wang Xuance served as an envoy to the western regions, his memoir "A Journey to Central India" also mentioned it. How did he do that? Indian magic. Bravo! He will climb up the rope? Come with me and you won't get hurt. Go! Go! Help! Stay away from Rope Trick. Help! Go. Snakes! I hate snakes! Got you! Hack! - Jack! - Professor! Jack! Jack! Help me! Jack! Move on! Come with me or I'll get you. You want it back? Throw at him! Jones! You okay? Don't move! Go! - Uncle Jack! Uncle Jack! - Stay right there. Kick! - Get in! - No! Come on! Let's go. Lucky that I got delayed by my visa. Or else, we'd all be snatched. Watch closely. Find out where they are taking them. Hello Jack. The boss is waiting for you. And you, you have to stay in the car. Please, come with me. Jack! Welcome to my humble oasis. Let me show you around. Actually, you look better without them. Ough... He saw through Professor's gadget. Let these guys play with your toys. Look! How noble they are! Aren't they so beautiful! Jack. People say the lion is the king of all beasts. I disagree. Jack, these small, ugly little creatures, there's something special about them, you know. They never lose their objectives. Jack! Help! They wait, hungry, and attack, when the time comes. A pack of them can take... any lion. What do you want? You know, our ancestors have sacrificed their lives collecting the treasures of Magadha. But her family has been hiding that from us for the past 1,000 years. I want it back, Jack. Take it. Let them go. I don't care about the diamond. I care about you... helping me, open that treasure. I don't know if I can. Aren't you the greatest archaeologist in China? Just one of them. The treasure belongs to the world, not to one man's life. "The origin is not destroyed. Everything is empty." "The material is not different from the immaterial." "The immaterial and the material are one and the same." Stop! Professor. Sorry for interrupting you. You know, Buddhism left India for China 2,000 years ago. And it's no longer in fashion here. Open it, or they die. No... no. I'm a bit worried. I'm going in to take a look. Be careful! I guess the professor's not going to save us now, huh? We'll find a way. How? I mean, I know you're smart, but how? I'm gonna die! Hey, come on. We're all going to die. Everybody dies. But I'm gonna die now! I don't wanna die now. Stop crying, come on. Hey, look. You have a running nose now, come on. - Yeah, I know. - Stop crying. - Help me! - Help you... ...with your nose? Make you feel better? Wait a minute... Jones! Xiaoguang? Come get us out! How? Come down, pull up the cage. I come down? Yes! OK, just a minute. Xiaoguang, what are you trying to do? I need to go down to rescue them. How are you going to get down there with that many hyenas? I think these are all she-hyenas. The females should love... tender fresh meat. [Also Chinese slang for "handsome young men"] Watch out! Xiaoguang, behind you... in front of you! This's for you. Brilliant, Xiaoguang. Come on, let's go! Don't let go! Guys, hurry up! Oh, no! No, no, no, no... Come on! I got you. Ouch! Easy! Good doggy. Jones. Jones! Jones! Bad dog! Bad dog! Really bad dog! So strong! She's so strong! Jones! Help me! Jones, help! Xiaoguang! Grab my hand! Help me! Hold on tight! - Don't let go! - She got a bite! She bit my tender fresh meat! Help! My tender fresh meat! Thanks! That way! What should we do? Ferocious! - Jump! - OK. Xiaoguang! Now what? How you got in, we would get out the same way. When Xiaoguang asks you to run to him, you run as fast as you can. Got it? OK. I'll distract them. Come here! Run! Run quickly to Xiaoguang! OK. Run! There you go! Quick! Hurry up! Jones, faster! Step on me! Look out! Xiaoguang, get up here! Watch out! Hold on tight! She bit me. Don't worry! Keep holding on tight! Give me you hand! It's fine now. - You OK? - I'm fine. OK. You're bleeding! It hurts! Is this poisonous? Can you suck the blood out for me? No way. You'd better go to the hospital. Don't bother to ask her either. - Let's go. - What? OK. Come, let's go. Go. Do we have a plan? Just figuring it out. Look. This is the Temple of Thuban. Can we go in? I don't think so. Yes, we can. Follow me. Come on, move. Please don't wear the shoes. Please go out. You're right. Take care of him. Get him out of here. You two, open the gate. Let's go. These are the constellation of the ancient India. Give me the sceptre. Give it. I love Indiana Jones! Are you kidding? Are we going to wait for the sunlight? Technology. Put the light up there. Turn on the light! Here, the 27 signs of the zodiac. Twenty seven? In ancient India, there were 27. You didn't know that? What's your sign? Aries. Ashwini, Bharani, Krittika... These 3 make up Aries. Stop boring me with your silly superstition. Just focus. - Gemini. - Gemini. Hold tight! Hold tight! Oh my God! Be quiet! OK, okay. Don't move. I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. Oh, shit! Don't move. Good! It's gone! Thanks. Jack! How could you do this to me? What? I promised that I'd return the diamond. Jack! Jack! Another one? It's the same one. Same one? Jack! Jack, do something! Sorry. Jack! Hold tight. I... I can't! Don't let go! OK, you're safe. Yeah, I'm OK. Don't worry. Did you see the cave? Where? OK, I count to three. OK. Go! - Three! - What? You okay? Just hold on. You okay? "I seek refuge in the Amitabha Buddha." [Buddhist prayer in Sanskrit] I think, maybe there's a way out. OK. Here, boss. Are you guys having fun? Yeah. I... I... We like rock climbing. You go first. Follow him. Yes, sir. Jack! Guys... Guys! Don't go... Don't go yet. Don't leave me up here. This is what really has value today! This is the passion, devotion, dedication. No one can do this anymore. Light it up! Right! Let's go! Guys, get the gear. Let's start. What are you doing? Stop! Please, respect history... Come on. Hey, Jack. Do you know how much the global gold reserve is? Is 32,000 tons. And this is much more than that! And of course, We have all these boxes full of treasure. Open the cases. Take it easy! Guys... Hey, guys. Can you help me down? Let me figure it out. We'll come back to you. Please don't go. Don't go, man! Don't leave me here. What is this stuff? Useless! No gold inside. What are you doing? This is about medicine. This one is Buddhism. You just don't get it. "He who possesses the Eye of Shiva possesses the whole world." But it never meant power and money. This is the knowledge and wisdom to help people live better lives. The modern world was built by these ideas. You're just too blind to see it! We are living in the modern world and this is all rubbish! This is a treasure. It has the power to transform all of us. Now, according to Indian law... Don't try to teach me the law of my country. I know better than you. And don't you forget, Jack, I follow the law of nature. Only the strong survive. Hey! Somebody's down there. We have companies, guys. Just take care of it. Let's go. You know why this bridge is broken? "The sea of bitterness has no bounds." "Turn you head to see the shore." Well, this's all bull... Go! No! Come on. Never touch a woman's hair! Come. This way. Go, go, go, go! Jack. Jack! Leave her alone! Really? You worry about yourself! "Eighteen strokes to subdue the dragon". "Eighteen kicks to tame the tiger". Bodhidharma, from India! "Mystical kicks in succession", Chinese Kung Fu! If you kick my legs again, the girl dies. Don't kick him. Gotcha! Good kick! Don't you dare! I told you the treasure doesn't belong to you. It belongs to the whole world. Belongs to the people. Perfect. Put it down. Honey! You okay? Yeah. You? I'm fine.
