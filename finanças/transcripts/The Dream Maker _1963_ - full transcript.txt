What's with you, then? I feel such a berk out here on my own, man. Well, you was marvellous at rehearsal. Yeah, but every time that little red light is on, I freeze Well, there's no need to, here, come here. All you gotta do is relax. Look. Forget about the people watching you, forget about the red light, just sing into the mic, right? I mean, sing to the wall or Mrs. Hackenschmidt who buys the record, anyone you like.

Well, and how did you like it, Mr. Magdeburg? Well, you know, it's an extraordinary thing. I put my hat down here five minutes ago and it's vanished. Oh, I put it up here, sir, so that it wouldn't get trodden on. What, who trod on it? Oh, no one sir, I put it there so that it wouldn't get trodden on. Oh, very thoughtful of you. My wife hates this hat, but I tell her that it's comfortable and I tend to wear it until it falls apart. That's very stylish. Mmm, like a hat, you know, never feel dressed without one. Well, of course, JB, you must realise, you know that is the boy's first disc. I mean, 10 days ago he was still working in a garage. You can't expect him to hit straight away. I don't agree at all, I think he has great talent. As a matter of fact, I think he's going to be something rather big, where did you find him? - Where? - Mmhmm. In a pub, we found him in a pub. Nice, light tone, infectious, the kids will go for him. - Agreed. - What's the time? It's half past five, Mr. Magdeburg. Of course, JB, the moment I spotted the boy I knew that he'd got what we're always looking for, that indefinable something, I think he'll be a very, very big performer. What's his name? Johnny De Little. Excuse me, De Little, Johnny De Little. Well, I've got a board meeting at six about the new studio, drive over with me and we'll discuss exploitation. I have a feeling about this boy. Aha, the young hopeful. Johnny, this is Mr. JB Magdeburg, our managing director. You should be very grateful to Mr. Catlin here, my boy. To his faith you owe your good fortune. Of course, but. Yes, well good luck, my boy, sing from the soul and do give a little credit. I'll do my best. Mmhmm. What ho, who's this? I'm... He works for KLO, like everyone else around here. One of the chief difficulties, JB, at A and R level is to find young executives with anything approaching flair. Why that no good jumped up two faced con man. Why didn't you speak up, you found Johnny. - That's right. - Look, if he feels... Waiting to see which way JB jumped and then claiming all the credit. Oh, I'd like to have seen him if JB had hated the boy. All right, love, that's enough. Look, I know you don't like Max, but I do owe him a lot, don't I? - Oh, rubbish. Johnny. Every success he's had, you brought to him. I started here as a tea boy earning 22 bob a week and glad to get it. - So? So I owe Max a lot for making me his assistant. I mean, I get a decent wage and I've got all the freedom I want, haven't I? - Yeah. - Yeah. Billy, could I have a word with you? - Yeah, all right. - I'll get my coat and see you in the car later. Oh, and could you get those tapes off me desk? 'Course. What's bothering you, then? I hate like hell to do this, Billy, but could you let me have another couple of quid? Oh, is that all, I thought it was serious. Just the rent and stuff, you know. Yeah, well, we call it an advance on royalties, then, eh? I'm really grateful, you know that? Ah, what's money? No, I mean, for pushing me, I mean, she's right, you know, it was you all along. Yeah, well, we'll look around tomorrow for another number then, eh? Yeah, that was marvellous today, it was real poster. Sorry! Okay, how much this time? Oh, he'll pay it back. Really, how 'bout all the ones that didn't? It's very tough for these kids, you know, Julie, I mean, if they believe in themselves, they gotta take risks. Shoulda seen old Johnny today, the way his knees were shaking before that take. I suppose if it's the difference between living your life on a factory bench or being a somebody, it really must be worth it. I put me foot in it again? No, come on, let's go. Oh, Billy, really. And what happened with Miss Thingamajig, you know? Oh, I had to get rid of her. Oh, I'll see if my mother's maid can help if you like. No, that's all right, love, I can manage thanks. Oh, I see, can't even afford a cleaning woman twice a week, now, I don't know what you do with your money. Well, there are better things to do with it, you know? Hey, I hadn't seen this before, is it new? Are these your parents? I got that frame in Portbella Road, you know. She's got a nice face, couldn't we go and see her sometime? Couldn't we? - What? Go and see them sometime? Yeah, sure, hey, is this trip still on tomorrow? Yes, Maureen phoned this morning. Oh, love, we've got to sing for our supper, I'm afraid. I told you'd mend her hifi for her. Oh, you did, did you? Well, you will, won't you? Well, I've got to take a bit of persuading, you know. Come here, then. - Mmm. - Persuaded? Mmm, yeah. Sorry. I've been going on at you all day haven't I, about Max and the parents and the money and. Oh, that's all right, at least you care. Yes, I do, I do. It's just that I don't understand how you let people trample all over you and why you're so ill at ease with people and that you're always coming out with all... Good heavens, did you fall asleep here last night? I happen to have been in this office since seven o'clock. I've already spoken to New York and Ram twice. You must have a very loud voice. The phones aren't switched through yet. And I can do without the funny dialogue this morning. Oh, feeling a bit liverish, darling? I'll give you some coffee. I have told you not so much of the darling in the office. Oh, beg your pardon, Mr. Catlin. Now don't start, Delia, I have a position to uphold here. I mean, you know how it is, you start people talking and the next thing my authority is entirely undermined. The office is the office and let's keep it that way. Until the next wet afternoon? Until always. Look, Delia, you are an extremely able bodied, you are an extremely able secretary but you are not irreplaceable. No, I had noticed that, Mr. Catlin. Good, well, get Billy Bowles in here right away, would you, oh, and put a line through, darling, I want to speak to Val Parnell about Sunday night at the Palladium. Yes sir, if you would just, thank you. Hello, Billy not in yet? Hello, no, shouldn't be a minute, though. Oh, Max wants to have a word with him. Okay, I'll tell him. By the way. There was a man outside just now asking a lot of questions about him. Such as? How long has he worked here, where his parents live. I wonder what it was all about. Obvious, isn't it, private detective hired by his wife. He's not married. How do you know? I just do, I just do. They are always married. Oh, sometimes it lies low out of sight like an infection but dig deep enough and you'll find some pudding faced little number who got her hooks into him in kindergarten. Hmmph, you sound bitter. No, just experienced. I don't believe it. Not about my Billy. You said yourself you didn't understand what he did with all his money. They're probably separated and he has to support the inevitable battalion of babies. He's as good as proposed. Good morning, sir. Don't I know you from somewhere? Bowles, sir, I work for Mr. Catlin, sir. - Who? - Max Catlin, sir. Yes, well, keep in touch, Catlin, keep in touch. Yes sir. Morning all. It's a lovely day for that drive, Julie. Mr. Catlin wants to see you in his office at once. What for? I haven't the faintest idea, but if you'll take my advice you'll swan along there at the double. Got out the wrong side of the bed, did he? Right side, wrong bed. Oh. Won't be long, love. Did you have to be so rude? Oh come off it, do you think he considered your feelings, stringing you along when all the time he had a stud farm down in Hatch End or somewhere? No proof of that at all? No, who are these for? Come in, you took your time. - I'm sorry, Max, but... - This boy De Little is very, very hot. JB has fixed him a spot on Sunday night at the Palladium. What tomorrow? Yeah, somebody's gone sick, so he's standing in for them. Hey, that's terrific. Now has he got an act or anything prepared? No, not really. Well, he can do Wind in the Rain. We'd need a new suit, though. Don't bother me with details. Draw some petty cash. The point is JB has flipped so we've got to get behind this boy and push. Now they'll want him early tomorrow at the Palladium for a camera rehearsal so you'd better work with the boy for the rest of the day. Today's a bit dodgy, Max. A bit what? I'm in a sort of a situation this afternoon I can't get out of. - You can't get out of? - Yeah. I've noticed a note of reckless independence in one or two things you've done lately. Don't you like it here anymore? Oh yes I do, honest, I promise, sir. Because if you think a man of your immense natural disadvantage can earn a living anywhere else Now are you gonna work with the boy or not? - Yes sir, but... - That's better. You can take your girl out tomorrow, she'll understand. More again. They're really sold on Johnny. - Good. - JB's fixed him a spot on the Palladium show. Super. Max wants me to rehearse him for it. Marvellous. 'Course, it means working this afternoon. Well, it is an important break for him, isn't it? It's terrific, but we won't be able to go and see your friends. That's all right. We can go tomorrow. I'm sorry, love, that's out too. Why, you don't have to be at the Palladium until evening. Well, that's it, I've got a longstanding engagement which I can't get out of. You have one with me too. I didn't mean to break it, love. But you did, and you intend to keep the other one? But it's not like that, Julie, really. Then what is it that's so much more important than being with me? Well, it's a private matter. It's something I can't talk about really. It's to do with me, with me family. All right. All right, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet! Quiet, shh. Now it's someone's birthday today, isn't it? Yes. Well, I can't for the life of me remember who. Me! No, no, no, it can't be all of you, can it? Now I think the first one is, and I'm not quite sure, is Penny. There's no one else, is there? - Me! - Oh, Herbert, I'm terribly sorry, there we are. And what do we usually say? Happy birthday! You missed. Is it anyone else's birthday? Me. It can't be yours, Pete, yours was last month. No it wasn't. Well, how old are you, then? 21. Now have I got a present for the rest of you? Listen, listen, listen, I'm gonna give 'em to Christine, now love, and she's gonna give out to you one at a time and I said one at a time, all right? Billy, I'd like to introduce Miss Venter, Mr. Bowles. - How do you do? - Hello. You seem to have quite a way with them. Oh, well, they're used to me really, I suppose. Miss Venter is from the variety club to see if they can help us with the new piano. Oh, we certainly need one. Excuse me. All right, quiet, quiet. Quiet, you have got a lot of energy today, haven't you? Well, I'll tell you what, we'll work it all of in the garden, all right, on your marks, get set, wait for it, not, last one there's a monkey, go go go! Billy, Billy, Billy! Ah, come on, titch, we'll go round the back way with you, mate. He's wonderful with them, isn't he? Billy's visit is the biggest thing in their lives. Does he come here regularly? He hasn't missed a Sunday in five years. He must be really devoted to those children. He was here himself from the age of two. His parents were killed in an air raid in 1944. He knows just how important outside contacts are for the children. For what we are about to receive, the Lord make us truly thankful, amen. It's a regular zoo, isn't it? I think they're all marvellous. Not a bit like I expected it to be here. Well, they're not too bad considering. You don't have any family of your own, Mr. Bowles? No, I'm not married. Well, you ought to be, you'd make a wonderful father. Don't put ideas into his head. We don't want to lose him to some glamour girl. There's not much danger of that, unless it's Penny. They're quick aren't they? They don't want to miss Dream Maker. Come on, then, usual positions at the double. Come on, titch, titch, lovely, lovely, lovely. You'd better take my chair. This is a little ritual we go through every Sunday afternoon Excuse me. Ready Billy? - Ready.

Come up with us, Billy, come up! All right, all right, come on, then, down you come, Penny love, that's it. Now the secret is silence, shh. Shh. Go go go go go, come on, come on, come on, come on, go! Go on, titch, go on, up you go. You too, Penny. Sorry I forgot the words. Oh that's all right, love. I'm sure all the big stars do too sometimes. I remembered them all week and then when you come, I forget. Aw, do you, oh, well, never mind, next Sunday when I come, we'll see if you've improved, all right, go on, off you go. You're not cross with me? No, of course I'm not but I will be if you don't get out of here. Penny for them? Oh. Wishing for the moon, I suppose. Come on, I'll help you clear up. Sally, are you there? Take 'em as we pass 'em through, love. Heard any more about that lease? Oh yes, we had another meeting last week, but they won't budge. Either we have to buy the place or pay three times the rent. Well, that's daft, don't they realise how important it is? Got to face facts, either we pay the increased rent or get out. How long have you got? A few months at the outside. What's it gonna cost? An extra thousand a year at least. A thousand, you'll never get that. Oh, if only we could raise the first quarter's payment, I'm sure something'll turn up. Yeah. I followed him to the orphanage again sir, but it's not like you thought at all. You mean he hasn't got a child in there? No sir. And he isn't even married? I don't think so, sir, but he is an orphan himself. He was brought up at the Ladywick Orphanage. Parsons, I don't mind if he was brought up in the middle of Clapham Common. Now sit down and try and get it into your thick skull what it is I want you to do. My daughter Julie is obviously determined to marry this fella. She's very attractive, and one day she's going This makes her a natural prey for playboys, penniless adventurers. I don't think Mr. Bowles is any of them, sir. I don't want to know what he isn't. I want to know what he is. Is he married and if he isn't, is he respectable? Now that's all I've asked you to find out and in four weeks, what have you brought me? Nothing. But I have, Mr. Singleton, I've brought this. - Some kind of a joke? - No, sir, it's Billy Bowles, I found it in his file at the orphanage. There are details of his parents there too, sir. Ah, then you know about his parents. No, I was disturbed before I could get that far. But I could go back there, sir. No, no point in running that risk. Til we know whether in fact this is a photo of Bowles. How do we find that out? By the birthmark, see if Bowles has one on his leg. Might I suggest, sir, that this is now a job for a female operative? That is an entirely improper suggestion with which I can in no way associate myself. Now you'll do the job, you'll start tonight. According to Julie, Bowles is backstage at the Palladium. You'll get in somewhere and find out. How do you propose that I obtain sight of this, sir, the blemish? You'll think of something. I already have, sir. And I don't like it. I don't like it at all. That was great, Johnny. No, that was a right mess. Oh don't be daft, listen to 'em. Well done, sir. Excuse me, haven't you a spot of paint on your trousers, there, sir, yes just a little spot. - Hello, Russ. - hello, Bill. Russ Conway, Johnny De Little. How do you do, John? I heard your song and it was good, very good. Thanks very much. I wonder whether you'd do me a favour. I'm gonna run a charity contest in about two weeks' time and I wonder whether you'd come in and sing a couple of songs for me, would you? - Would I. - Great, can I get your phone number off Billy? - Meet me at the office. - Right, and then I'll fix up the details. - Fine. It's your day, Mr. Conway. Just come on then, see you, John, night, Bill. - Bye bye. - Bye. I can't be as bad as I thought. I must be off my nut, with all the contacts I've got, why didn't I think of it before? What are you talking about? Where's the Clyde Valley Stompers appearing tonight? The Mocca Night Club, why? Thanks. You see, the main thing is this, I'm getting up a charity show for the Ladywick Orphanage in about three weeks' time and I wonder if you and the boys would like to come along and do the show, you know what I mean? I don't know what the theatre is, mind you, but as I soon as I hear, I'll let you know as soon as I can, is that all right? Okay. Thanks very much. Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention for a moment, please? In our Sunday night guest spot, we welcome to this club for the first time, the Clyde Valley Stompers. Scuse me, Billy. Talk to you later, all right? Sure. Oh, I'm terribly sorry, sir, that was a complete accident. If you'd come to the gentlemen's with me, and take your trousers off, I'll have them cleaned and pressed for you. Yes, thanks very much. Something wrong, sir? Oh, it was just an accident. I was just explaining it, sir, that if he takes his trousers off... I'll look after Mr. Bowles. Yes, but I want his trousers. You get this cleaned up, you've done enough damage. - Yes, but... - Thank you very much. Thank you. It's the Lambeth Theatre, yeah. It's eight o'clock on the evening of Sunday the 23rd. That's right, Russ, oh, we got the new fella, Johnny De Little, he's agreed to do it, yeah. You will, great, I'll send you a letter of confirmation later, okay, Russ, thanks again, bye bye. Hello, love. Good morning. What have I done now? Here, what's all this now you've done? I'm changing offices. You're what? Let go of me. Have you gone mad or something? On the contrary, I think I've just come to my senses, if you must know. You're not still on about Saturday, are you? That and other things. Well what other things? Your wife, your kids? Who let on, then? Delia spotted it. - Shrewd one, that. - Yes. How? Those children's toys you brought in, for a start. Very conclusive. Very funny, I don't think there's anything to laugh about. I don't think there's anything to laugh about either. I think that Delia wants a good spanking spreading silly rumours like that about everywhere. You mean it's not true? Of course it's not true. Oh you'd say that anyway. What'd you expect me to say? The truth, that's all? The truth? All right. The toys. Well, they're for some kids I visit every Sunday at an orphanage. An orphanage, why? 'Cause I come from there and it's like home to me, that's why. Your parents are still alive, so. I overstated that one a bit, love. What, why would I care? It's not you, it's your father asking me about my background and going on about badly brought up kids. What would have said if he knew the school I went to was an orphanage? You needn't have lied to me. Well, once I started, I got carried away. Oh. I care where you're brought up, was it a good orphanage? Great. Take me there Sunday. Do you mean you really want to go? Oh yes. Hey, I just thought of something. I've had a bit of a brain wave. I'm gonna have a charity show for 'em. - That's good. - That's Russ Conway I had on the phone just now, he said he's gonna do it. That's marvellous, what acts are we having? Well, I've jotted some names down here. Would you make a list? Oh. I'll send a note round to Dick Cowman, and I'll have a go round at the studio for his answer later. That's wonderful. Come in. I'm April Dotton from the pool. What pool? I'm your new secretary. I'm ever so sorry, love, didn't they tell you? It's all been changed. It's not fair, I've been in that horrible pool for six years and every time I get assigned to a man, something goes wrong. Well, never mind, Miss Drashwell will explain. It's all a mistake. But I am very musical. That's why I joined KLO in the first place. I've been trying to see Mr. Catlin for months about my voice and I thought working here I'd be able to meet him at last. I'm sorry. And I'd have liked working for you too. Cor blimey. Come in. Hello, Delia. Sorry, April, he's busy. He's always busy. Couldn't I? No, dear, you couldn't. Look, if you really have got a good voice, why don't you make a record of your own, give it to me and I'll make sure that he at least hears it. Oh, would you? Anything to oblige, now be a good girl and buzz off. I'm up to my eyes. Oh gee, Delia, thanks, you're ripping. Now what is it? I'm on the wrong end on number six going. Well, fix it, will you? We've been messing about here for one hour and no completed take yet. All right, Max. Max, I wondered if I... What are you doing here? Well, I wondered if I... Now what, hmm? It's nothing I can't locate with a couple of weeks' careful research. We don't only need new balance engineers, we need new jokes. You want four track, Max? Cyril, those trombones are all to cocking that in the middle eight, what are they, semi quavers or triplets? Quavers. Well, put them right, will you? Yes. Is it four track, Max? Since when has it been anything else? Some of the others prefer two. Trombones. - Max. - What are you doing here, anyway? Well, I wondered if I could have a quick word with Dick. Wants to have a quick work with Dick, now listen, Sir William, I'm halfway through a two hour session and so far the only thing I've got on tape is the squeal of a dying microphone. Now keep quiet or get out before I break your neck. Okay for a take, Max. Well, let's go then. Stand by for a take, here we go. Roll tapes. Okay, we're running.

We fixed the theatre, John Barry's taking care of the musicians, oh, and Jeff Mundy's coming over later about the posters. - Well, that's good. - Anything else? - Letters of confirmation. - Huh? - Letters of confirmation. - Oh yeah, good girl. Take this, dear blank, all right? Yeah. Dear blank, as I said before, this is to confirm your kind acceptance. - Hey. Well, you know what I mean. Listen, did you know Max was asking about another number from Johnny De Little? Oh it's all right, took care of that yesterday. Oh. Hello, thank you. Miss Marion Ryan, please. Mr. Billy Bowles. Just a minute, one minute. Hello? Hey, you've been busy today. Now look, I was phoning you about... Well, Billy, look, if it's about that PA, don't worry about it, it's all fixed. Well, actually, it's about a charity concert that... I'll have to call you back. Oh, so you do drop in here occasionally between private engagements. - Well, I'm sorry, Max... - I've been trying to contact you for two days. - I know, I... - Don't give me excuses. Just remember what I told you the other day. If ever a man was replaceable, it's you, my lad, so buckle down to it, now sit down and listen 'cause this is important. JB is giving a party for the city tycoons that own that land he wants to buy for the new extension. He's been working on it for some months now and I gather they're just about ready to sign so tomorrow he's going to give them a slap up luncheon, then show 'em the whole KLO operation. That's fine. The point is, we want a little light relief afterwards if you follow me. Not exactly. The most important of them is a 98 year old sex maniac called Lord Sweatstone, if we keep him happy, the deal's as good as fixed, now do you get the drift? No, not really. I want you to get the sexiest looking little number you've auditioned here recently, right? What about Sonia Delahaye? We can't have anyone under contract to the group. There's not much chance of that, she can't sing. Immaterial, Sweatstone is tone deaf. JB just wants something for him to drool over while he's signing, now is this, what's this, Sonia, she's good looking? All over, she's a stripper at the Chez May. That is the type we want, have her audition disc and picture on my desk this afternoon, right? Yeah, Max, sure. And mark the young lady's card, a great deal depends on Sweatstone's mood, so if you value your future here make sure there are no mistakes, got it? Yeah. That's show business. So what are we in now, white slave traffic? No mind that, get us Marion again, will you, love? Do you know, I thought this was a respectable firm. If anyone on the outside could hear what goes on here sometimes, I don't know what they'd say, do you want Marion? Luckily no one can hear. Oh, Mr. Catlin, somebody might come in! Never mind about that, come over here. Billy, you've got me out of the bath. I'm sorry I had to hang up, but it is important. I wonder if I could see you today. I'm dripping water all over the carpet. I'll tell you what, why don't you come round this afternoon, I'll be home all day. What about four o'clock, okay, all right, love, thank you, she wants me to pop round this afternoon. Oh, well, what do I do about the Sonia Delahaye audition disc? Oh, you take care of it for us, oh, and give him that photo she sent round. Fine. - Oh come on. - No. - Come on. - Oh, all right. What are we doing there? Oh, it's not what I'm doing here, it's what they're doing in there. Oh. Men really are quite vile aren't they? - Oh, come on. - What have you got there? The Sonia Delahaye audition disc. Any good? With a figure like hers, what does it matter? Sickening. Come in. Oh not now, April. But I've brought my record. I don't care what... Your what? The title is Call Me Kitten, You Big Cat You.

Yes, Russ Conway did mention it to me. Well, is there any chance at all of you? Well. Oh no. Oh yes, but just for you. Oh thanks, you know, you're a real pal. Yes, I know it, it's my problem. Hmm? Now that is what I call talent. This girl carries more freight than Carter Pattison. Where's her disc? - In front of you. What's the title? Call Me Kitten, You Big Cat You. That's good, that's very, very good, that has appeal. Here we are.

Hey, that's a much better layout, Jeff, let's have another look. Do you think you could make these names a bit bolder? - Yeah, sure, will do. - Great. Well, that's the letters of confirmation done. There's nothing else, is there? No thanks, love. Well, when the post boy comes, if I'm out, will you make sure he takes them? Will you? - Yes, all right, love. Now what about programmes? Oh, that's a straightforward layout, nothing fancy about that, here we are. Oh, that's great, Jeff, that's just what I wanted. Well, I'm off, then. Oh, switch me through, Delia, will you? Cheers, Billy. Thank you. Yes Mr. Catlin, did you want me? I thought I told you to lay on a PA for Debbie Lee this afternoon. Well, why not? This is the third time I've had to speak to you about incompetence, Bowles. Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Catlin, but you see... Come in. - Any letters? - Yeah, there. Well, and I said... Love, did you get the post from Mr. Bowles? - Yes miss. - Oh, jolly good. Fine, well, see you stick to it and you can start by double checking everything on this shindig tomorrow, we cannot afford slipups where JB is concerned. Yes, Mr. Catlin, I'll take care of everything meself, sir Yes sir. The great I am? Yeah, he only wants me to stage manage the Sweatstone affair as if I haven't got enough to do. He knows very well I've got to go to the film studios this afternoon to see Shane Fenton. And tomorrow morning I've got the theatre bookings about the charity show, where's the Debbie Lee card? Oh, Debbie Lee, next one down. Listen, you do enough wet nursing him, it'll be all right and I'll check with Delia if you like. Don't forget tonight. - What? You will be back in time for tonight, now won't you? Be back in time tonight for what? My mother's party. Oh look, don't get me wrong, but do you think she'd mind very much if I didn't go? Yes she would, and so would I. Look, Billy, you've got to get over this thing of yours sooner or later. My folks are really very nice people given half a chance. - I know, I'm sorry. - You great nit. Just relax and be yourself and everyone will see you just like I do. Well, I tell you what, as soon as I finish at the studio this afternoon, I'll get changed and come right over, all right?

I got your message, yeah, by the way, what date did you say it was? - The 23rd. - I think that'll be okay. I'll let you know tomorrow. - Oh, thanks. - Could we have you back for a moment, please, Shane? - Sure. I'll see you in a minute, Bill. - Ah, Bowles. - Hello, sir. - Enjoying yourself? - Yes, thank you, sir. Good, good, where's Julie? She's in the other room, I think. You know everybody, do you? - Not really. - Well, I say. We can't have that. Archie? - Excuse me. - Don't forget my letter. - Right. This is Bowles, works for Julie. - How do you do? - Pleased to meet you. Look after him, will you? I've got to play host. Do you come here often? Now and again. Friend of the family, I suppose? Hardly, I did have a bit of a ding with Julie once, though Ah. Archie, darling, where have you been? Oh, around, darling, around, look, I've been meaning to ask you. - Hello. - Hello. It's a bit hot, isn't it? - Not particularly. Oh. Would you like a smoke? I never touch the filthy things, thank you. What's your connection here, then? I'm a cousin, actually, and you? Oh, I'm, I'm having a bit of a ding with Julie. You disgusting little man. I'm most awfully sorry, sir, it was an accident. I'll get you a change of trousers, sir. - You're joking. - But sir, sir, come here, sir. - Waiter. Madam. Some ice, madam? - Yes, please. What on earth is that? Gin and mohair, madam. Your whiskey, Lord Sweatstone. Oh, thank you. - What kept her? - She couldn't get away. Damn, I wanted to talk to her first, still, there's no time now, how does she look, she's not overdressed, is she? No, I don't think you'd say that. Fine, fine, the old buzzard is practically in the bag so shop her up here as soon as the song is finished. - If you insist. - Don't be like that, dear. This is business. Whenever you're ready, JB. Excuse me. What? - The girl is here. - What girl? You know, sir, the one for him. Oh, good, good. Okay, Delia, right away. Right. Just one moment, gentlemen, if you please, I think you will all agree with me that you have heard some really great artists, all fabulous recording stars, well it is now KLO's pleasure to present to you a young lady who has not yet made her first record but in whom the company has really great faith, it is our pleasure to present to you London's sexiest singer, Ms. Sonia Delahaye in Call Me Kitten, You Big Cat, You. Oh, lovely girl, lovely. How did you get on? - Sacked. - No. - Yeah. - But I told him it was my fault. He said I should have been there to see it didn't happen anyway, and he was right. I don't understand the panic. I mean, the deal's gone through, hasn't it? Only 'cause the old fella was half blind. Otherwise we'd have lost it. - Oh, Billy, I am sorry. - That's all right, love. Something'll turn up. What about your charity show? Oh, I can still handle that. I don't get me cards for a couple of weeks. Billy, Lynn, Herbert, Godfrey, Jimmy, Hugh, Pete, William one, William two, Sarah, Sally, Joan, Linda, Norman, Brenda, David and Eileen, there. The bus is ready, Mrs. Openshaw. Right, now anyone want to take a trip before we go? No, Mrs. Openshaw. You sure, no moans on the way then, you've had your chance Oh, hold it. Children, come back here a minute, will you? Now look everyone, I know this is a party but you must remember that Uncle Billy will be depending on you not to let him down so no raspberries and bags of applause for everyone who comes on the stage, understand? Yes, Mrs. Openshaw. Sunday best behaviour all the way then, off you go. No no, I want all that stuff for the mystery show at the other side. Hey, they're coming in already. Have you got the running order, Billy? - Yeah. - It's getting a bit late, isn't it, where the devil are they all, ta. I've been looking for you, I can't contact any of the artists. Well, you sent the letters, didn't you? I didn't, you gave them to the post boy. But I didn't even see 'em. I left them on the desk. Well, look, don't worry about that now, just try and get in touch with them. Well, supposing they're not home. - Well, do the best you can. - In 10 minutes? 10 minutes? Hey Billy, do you want them to start the overture? No, I mean, yes, yes. Hey, Alec, look, get these covers off will you and for Pete's sake, see nobody puts a foot on the stage until we take the curtain up. Give Jeff Love the cue to start the orchestra. Right. Sit down all of you and be quiet. - When's it coming on? - Any minute now. Just be quiet. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, that's perfectly all right. Sit down, Pete, say you're sorry to the gentleman. Sorry, are you my daddy? No, little boy, I'm sorry, I'm not. I wish you were, you're lovely. What's your name? Pete. What a charming child, look here, do you think he can see all right behind there? Oh, yes. How would you like to come and sit on my knee, Pete? Yes please. There we are. I. I take it you're the people this show's for? - Yes we are. - It's a wonderful idea. Well there you are, my boy, now you can see everything, hmm I can't get hold of any of them. - Have you tried everywhere? - Everywhere. What are we gonna do? Oh. What are we gonna do? Whatever it is, we better do it now, otherwise we're gonna have a riot on our hands. Look, the only thing to do is go out there and explain to them. Oh, go on, there's nobody else to do it. Me? Go out there? When's it gonna start? Shh, look. Can I have your attention, please, ladies and gentlemen? Oh no, he's not gonna make a speech, that's all I'm short of. Now now, just relax, enjoy yourself. As you know, we had a tremendous array of talent lined up for you this evening. But I'm sorry to say none of 'em's turned up. That's my Uncle Billy. Well, I'm not his uncle really, you know. Sing us a song, Billy! Don't be silly, I can't. Perhaps I'd better introduce myself. My name is Billy Bowles and I make records. This is Jeff Love, we've done a few sessions together. Well, look, Jeff knows how to make a record but perhaps you don't, so if you don't mind, I'll explain it to you, now first and foremost we get a big orchestra into a big studio. Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you very much, thank you. And once they're all settled, we begin the balancing process which means each and every section of the orchestra starts to play and we make 'em sound just like we want 'em to. So Mr. Bass. Now is it possible that you could slap it a bit? That's lovely, on the drums. Trombones. That's lovely, now we prepare the singer, he's ready. A little bit of sweetness from the strings.

As I said, you can't watch me for three hours, but why not sit and back and watch and listen to the magic of Marion Ryan? Hey, how did Marion get here? Oh, Julie found her somehow, by the way, she told me to tell you she's gonna find the others now.

Well, he had the audience in the palm of his hand. They loved it. Yes, but he'd be no good on a record. Well, Norman Vincent at BMI didn't think so. I'd never seen him look so excited. He dashed backstage before the curtain was down. What? He's probably signing him right now. I discovered Bowles. Some people in this business have no ethics, no loyalties at all. What did I tell you? Yes, well, I'll very soon put a stop to that. Well, thanks very much, it's very kind of you. - Hello, Norman. - Oh, hello, mate. I hear that latest one of yours is doing nothing. Could I have a word with you? Yeah, why not? I'll phone you in the morning then, Billy. - Oh, and thanks again. - Thanks, thanks for what? Well, I don't see that it's any business of yours. Fred? - Yeah. Look, about these tables and chairs, do you think you can move them about three foot down towards the riser, they're too upstage. - Yeah, right away. - Okay. What do you think of the show? As a matter of fact, that's just what I wanted to speak to you about. That's a pretty fair voice you've got there. Needs a little polish but I think with some training we might be able to do something with it. Oh, well, that's a very funny thing, Max, but Norman Vincent thinks it's good enough for EMI just as it is. Jim! Get that stuff out of the corner there. - Have you signed? - No, not yet. Ah, now I'll give you double, now what do you say? Is Tony Mercer ready? Yes, he's just coming down. Now listen, Bill, now you're morally obligated, you're the man who gave you... - Ow! Never mind about Vincent. Not again. - I've got it. - You've got what? Proof, sir, I've seen it, I've seen the mark. Well done, Parsons, well done. Thank you, sir. Curtain up.
