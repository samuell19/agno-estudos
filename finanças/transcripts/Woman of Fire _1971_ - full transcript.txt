The maid and the landlord have been killed. Also, we heard that the murderer is a teenager What would you say about this? Wouldn’t the teenagers’ motives hinder the decision-making of the mass media? The media only reports the truth We are all victims of the Cold war for the past 25 years. And we know why teens are so aggressive nowadays. The police forces are trying hard to preserve the public order and lead the criminals on the right path. Which is equivalent to getting medicines prescribed after being sick. Who is responsible to educate them? There is a reason why they are so against the media. Wouldn't society be better if the media was brave enough to fight corruption? well, if you can excuse me now This young man claims that he picked it up from the floor This is not a joke! Two people were murdered because of a damn TV and a radio. The family of the victim lost their master and their life will no longer be the same. Now it's your turn to open your mouth, we have enough evidence. It was me. I killed them and stole their properties. I'm telling you what I did. What more do I need to say? Madam, is he the robber that broke into your house? (Silence with no answer) Get the written statement from him since he confessed. yes sir. A friend of the dead maid is here. Really? Let's talk to her! (Witness prospect steps in for questioning) Eh. Your occupation? A lounge girl How are you related to the dead maid? We ran away from the countryside together. I despise girls from the countryside like you. That's all you do! Dirty jobs! In the countryside, there are people waiting for money from girls like us. They need to buy lands and build new roofs. (She recalls her past) Look What do we do? Hurry, follow me. Take me with you! (They are running away from strangers) (Struggling to defend themselves) (On the way to Seoul) I made up my mind. Since we got kicked out of the countryside, I'm going to become a gold-digger. Teahouse, bars, anything I can do to make money I’m going to be a maid in a rightful household. That way I can learn their ways of living. I heard that there are 31 story buildings in Seoul. Let's continue with our lives by looking at those buildings even if we get separated from each other. 31 story building? Sounds like an easy way to die. (They are traveling to Seoul for job) (Waiting in the job market) Hey, any potential lounge girls here? Stay still I have high blood pressure which is why I'm annoyed all the time. It's a high-class lounge There is a guy who spends $10 daily What do you say? Must be crazy. Silent! Not everyone will be able to make money. You have to face the reality. -Anyone? -God, my head hurts. I will go Mm, do you know how to dance? Shake your butt or something. You have to learn how to dance first. Ok, follow me. Kyung-Hee! Go out there and make a lot of money. Remember "31 story building" is our code. Got it. Welcome, ma'am. I did get the call beforehand I'm not sure if you can find a dedicated maid. Unless you hire them for grocery shopping... Go ahead and start talking. How much do you spend on groceries? 50 cents. Oh my gosh, you are so cheap. We have our own chicken farm, so you will be able to see chicken and eggs daily. Wow, she wants us to be chicken slaves too I've raised chickens before. Follow me. How much do you want to be paid? The brokerage is pretty expensive too. My mother told me not to get paid but to use marriage as a condition. Marriage? I know that you are a frugal housewife Okay We will do it that way then First of all, can you write a postcard for me? I promised my mother (Myung-ja is happy to have a job) (Myung-ja starts working) - What the hell is that! - You can't do that Give me that! (Myung-ja learns to work at a large poultry farm) You have to knock before you enter the chicken coop They may not be able to lay eggs if they get scared. (Myung-ja learns how to do her job) You have to make the chicken feed with meat and calcium so they can lay big eggs. Meat is important. Like frogs, tadpoles, mudfish, and worms Anything that moves. Put the mudfish in here, please. Now. Watch your hands. Your hands become their feed too if your they get caught in the machine. Be careful. (She continues to learn new things) Come in. good. (Myung-ja arrives at her work place) I can add this to the chicken feed too right? Put that away! Aren't you scared of it? Back home, I was awarded for catching more than 80 of these. I see. You can catch all the rats because they steal food from the chickens. But you cannot use the rat poison. Because it's dangerous for the kids and the chickens. Oh love, Oh bread, I will never forget about you. I can't forget about you. Mom, Chang-Jun is singing dad's most popular song. Didn't we promise that you won't have interests in your dad's job? Why am I eating the egg that mom raised? I'm not going to raise chickens when I grow up. That's too embarrassing! I'm going to become a songwriter to embarrass everyone. I can already imagine. Your songs are going to sound like dog sound. Ouch. Ouch! Mom, look at Chang-Jun Get up. Get up! Oh my God, you! (Hye-Ok and Dong-sik are testing their new song) I wrote a new song and I'm confident about it Because the company said they will conduct intensive PR It will cost at least $500 This song would suit you, Hye-Ok but do you have that kind of money though? I will pay, let me just see it. Hm? (Hey-Ok takes a look at the song and sings) I usually take my husband's clothes to the cleaner but you can wash this one. Why are there so many food stains on his clothes? Honey Yes Honey, Hye-Ok wants to buy the song for $500. Wow. This song would become more popular if a top-class singer sings it though. What's thinking about it going to do Ah, Love, Ah, Love You are someone that I can never forget. Ah, Milk Ah, mommy, you are someone I can never forget. (Night at Seoul) This one is on me. Excuse us for a second. I'm sorry What the hell are you doing? He owes us $300. You have to do anything to make him pay. If you can't get that money, you and I will have to jump off the bridge Here What do you think? I won't be able to get married then. Even a maid is trying to get married nowadays. Here. I can't. Just give me some alcohol. I may not be able to think straight. I will take her home and pay off what I owe you. Thank you, sir Our bar provides top-class service. Mm. Honey, you must be tired too. It's a lot better because of the maid. Where'd you find that girl? Darling, Were you in a relationship before? What are you talking about? There wasn't a single rumor even when I was a middle school teacher. Maybe, I never met the one. Who cares about that these days. Things just ignite when touched. 30,000 volts, you know? But you didn't get electrocuted. I know you worked hard to buy this house You worked so hard in the pile of chicken shit I would never betray you. However, girls have high voltages these days. Now that I think about it. We sacrificed everything for this house. Yes. This alcohol is really expensive. It was as expensive as a sack of rice. I will make rice wine with the leftover cold rice tomorrow you should try it Is this alcohol? That's fine Honey. Here you go yes You only know how to write songs but you don't know how to play instruments. You should show me your instrument skills. Those sex journals are ruining housewives these days! Sometimes, I need to pretend to be someone else if I want to keep my husband happy, you know? How about a strange virgin? Come here. You smell like alcohol. Stop No No, don't You treat the maid unfairly. So unfair. (Myung-ja recalls her traumatic event and struggles with agony) She went to learn from a rightful household. I wanted her to be happy. 31 story building. That's the code we made to wish the best for each other. Look at the madam. She's dressed like a bride even though her husband is dead. She's keeping a straight face. It wasn't the robber who killed her but it was her. She is the evil one here! Watch your mouth! You may be charged with false accusations. The murderer has confessed already. And that's him. I have a letter from Myung-Ja, she told me to give it to the cops if she ever. She said that the madam is going to kill her and the husband too You have to get rid of the chickens that eat too little or are too fat. They lay fewer eggs. Here If they don't lay eggs for a day, that's a loss for us, ok? Make sure you take care of the chickens while I'm gone. They are really sensitive so you need to take good care of them. That's crazy. By the way, my husband A lot of the female singers will be seducing him while I'm gone. Do whatever to stop them. Drag them out if they try to use the same blanket. Kick them out naked when they bathe together! If things go wrong, you can kill both of them. Kill them? Eat this, and cheer up You are the only one I can trust. Oh yea, Eat it with salt. (Myung-ja accepts the bribe) It's so hard to visit my parents before I give birth to the new baby. Why don't you stay there for a few days? The maid should take care of everything. ok Take care guys. Have a safe trip ma'am. Have a nice trip. (Myung-ja sends away the family members) Try this rice wine. I made it with cold rice. I thought you wouldn't be home since the madam isn't here. I have never cheated before. My friend who works at a bar told me that men hate to lose and are very jealous. So what? So they always get into an eternal triangle. An eternal triangle? (The man gets confused and tries the drink) It tastes like cider. I left my book here, I remembered after taking a bath. The teacher is here right? (Hye-Ok tries to seduce a married man) I want to drink with you. Strange. You are saying things that would get you kicked out. Here. Sir, have you cheated before? No. And I'm proud of it. (Hye-Ok has a drink and gets depressed) Go back. Do not put me in a difficult position. I don't have the money to buy your song. A boss of a company offered me $500 to go to the hotel with him but I couldn't do it. I'd rather die. But I really do need your song. Do you really need that money? Doesn't it humiliate you? I am your student. I'd rather have you... My body is worth the song. What do I do now.. This must be the eternal triangle. This is making me crazy. Sir, I thought you'd be thirsty. Mmm. Leave it there and get out! Please Get out! Sir, I got a cramp on my hand... What? Cramp? Let's see Sir, I brought the candles. Looks like your room is out of power. (Dong-sik struggles rejecting the seduction) I'm too drunk. The rice wine was way too strong. I'm an exemplary husband. I never cheated. But being a close-minded person... I always refused to spend money and am scared of my wife at all times. I'm scared that the world would know... It's always the successful men with money and girls. Sir. (Hye-Ok tries to wake him up) The madam would've killed both of you if she saw this. How are you so lustful for a married man. You are a damn maid. Get out unless you are going to kill me. This is a direct order from the madam. Out, out, out, out! Hye-Ok, Hye-Ok! Don't go. Don't go to the boss. Hye-Ok. I'm not Hye-Ok. You aren't? Where is she? No, you can't go. Move! Hye-Ok! I'm right here. This eternal triangle thing is driving me crazy. You are mine. (Myung-ja's traumatic event is recalled and is in trouble) I don't want to do that with anyone else. I need to keep my chastity for him. What I'm worried about is.. how will I stay with him forever? That's my problem. What? You will teach me? I have to learn that. (Myung-ja tries to overcome her trauma) (The family comes back from the trip) (He doesn't greet his family) Honey, I'm home and you wouldn't even come out? Ah, a musical motif just came into my mind. As soon as you stepped in. Can you get me the matches? Thank you Thanks Stop Look at that bitch feeding the chickens just now. Honey, was that bitch able to serve you well? She didn't do anything bad or good. (She is worried about Myung-ja's actions) Why did you kill so many chickens? Are you trying to get rid of all of my chickens? They haven't laid eggs in three days. That's because you didn't feed them on time. Ma'am, I went to the market they gave me ginsengs this big for a good price. If you eat the hardboiled chicken with the ginseng it will strengthen your relationship with your husband. You bitch. That's not your business. Here is the ginseng stew. This will improve your health. Ginseng stew? Sure, thanks (The secret note is handed and he reads it) Try some ok. (Myung-ja and Dong-sik meet up outside secretly) Don't give me notes like that. You don't talk to me at all. I wanted to kill myself when I saw you sleeping next to your wife. Darling. Have you lost your mind? Eat some, darling. Don't ever call me that! You are so cruel. You need to stop this. I'm your concubine. Shut up! Don't get angry. I'm not a virgin anymore. I can't get married anymore. Just treat me like a concubine I will act like I don't even exist. Finish the chicken before you leave! You need to know how to sex chicks. What do I do with the male chicks? Get rid of them. Here. Do not disturb me when I'm working. I have something to tell you. Please leave! I was gagging and throwing up and madam told me that I'd be a cute wife if I was married. It's better not to give birth to a bastard. The baby is trying hard to survive. No one can do anything about the baby. Even God! What happened? You don't look too good. You'd promise that you'd always trust me and save me. Yes My body and life are yours, aren't they? Even if I become a robber? yes. Even if I murder someone? Of course! What if I committed adultery and impregnate... No! Everyone wanted my new song. But she's young. Hye-Ok wanted to pay me with her body. So that was true. How did you sleep with me after cheating on me. I feel disgusted. Huh? You said you'd save me. I'd rather hear that you are dead. I was happy even though I went through a lot because I trusted you. Now that I lost you... How am I supposed to live the rest of my life? Maybe I've spoiled you too much. I'm just trying to discuss with you I'm talking about it because I didn't cheat on you. If you are a housewife you just need to look the other way so your man can gain confidence! You need to reflect on yourself. Will the child be taken care of if I let myself look the other way? She won't listen. That would harm her career as a singer too. It's not Hye-Ok. She said you requested her to do so. Myung-Ja intensely stopped us. So who is it then? I am very embarrassed right now. Who is it? I was drunk and it was a mistake. It's not Myung-Ja is it? She's literally working for free so she can get married.. How could you..! Disgusting! You disgust me. (She leaves the room and looks for Myung-ja) Myung-Ja? I heard from my husband that you are pregnant. Go ahead. I also heard that you sacrificed yourself to stop Hye-Ok for me. I even wrote a postcard to your mom telling her that I'd make sure that you get married to a good husband. This is all my fault. People can make mistakes. But you don't have to hold onto it forever. Ma'am, I tried to be good. I kicked her out but your husband was too drunk and... I'm really sorry ma'am. I don't want to bother you. I will do whatever you tell me to do with the baby. (She tries to run away from the pain of losing her baby) Now that the baby is gone, they don't even care about me anymore. Water! Someone help me, please! Water! Water! Water! (Korea Exchange Bank) Girls think that they are dead when they give birth. Isn't it weird how they forget about the pain when they are done with the labor? That's why there is a saying like this. If men were to give birth most of them will kill themselves because they are too scared. That's true. Men are cowards! Anyways, you are so blessed. We only have one problem now. How can we kick that bitch out of the house without causing trouble? What the. Are you trying to starve me to death? I didn't even have water for the past three days. You really didn't give her anything? I will bring it to you. How can you live without food? Honey, how could you do that? (Myung-ja looks at baby that her master took away from her) (Myung-ja's master quickly covers up the baby) Your baby must be really cute. Would my baby be this cute too? Ok, that's enough. You killed my baby but you love yours. You must be crazy. I wasn't crazy when it happened! The man of this household impregnated me and the wife made me get rid of the baby. Is my body toy or something? Your baby has to die too because you killed mine. Did you lose your mind? Darling! Oh no. Hey! Get back here! Oh my God! Oh no! My baby! I've never seen a terrible bitch like you. Come here! I will take you to the police even if this ruins my life. Let's go! You bastard! Let's go! Go! Come here! Darling! Darling! There is no way the baby will come back alive. Let's just focus on those who are alive now. If the world finds out about this situation our family will be all dead. Darling, Just think about our family Make sure no one finds out about this Let's just do whatever she wants. Give her money and clothes if she asks for them.. I want your husband. So I can have another kid. Do whatever you want. Darling, you should sleep in my room tonight. (Myung-ja gets into the kitchen and finds herself pathetic) I'm too scared to sleep alone. Are you coming or not? Just go with her. Do whatever she asks you to do. Now! Let's go (Myung-ja drags Dong-sik to her room) -Darling - No (Myung-ja tries to seduce Dong-sik again) Here Darling. Kids, wake up! We are all going to die if we stay here. Get up now! Let's go to grandparent's place. This house is haunted! Hurry up! Fast! Hurry! Faster! (Present days) I found a driver that was transporting a TV, a record player and a female passenger this morning. (Another witness comes in and confirms Jeong-suk's face) (Phone ringing) What? Huh? They were already poisoned with rat poison before they were stabbed? Both of them? They didn't get murdered by a robber! You poisoned your husband and maid out of hatred and you stabbed your husband's back with a knife to make it seem like that they were murdered by a robber Is there someone that's listening to this in the other room? (Past days) (Myung-ja encounters the broker) Hey you, Come here! (The broker drags Myung-ja to an old building) How come you never visited me? Others usually give me their first two paychecks. I don't work for money, I work for marriage as a condition. Very well. You still have your body. Look, We strictly check everyone's background. No one would hire you if they find out about what you did back in the countryside. You may be able to threaten me but I'm not the same anymore! (She gets harassed and raped by the broker) (She un-clogs the bath tub and cries in pain) Water! Water! Water! Water.. (Myung-ja brings some water for Dong-sik) A man has to kill when his girl is in danger. I didn't kill him. My husband did. We are one body. Both of us should be responsible for this. No, I didn't kill him. (Dong-sik wakes up with blood on him) Blood.. What happened? Did you do something when you were drunk? Who the hell is this? It's a thief. Maybe a robber. Did you kill him? But with what? I can't even kill a rat! Should I call the police? No! Let's think first. If this is not a thief but someone we know, we could be charged with murder. We can't be blamed for this. Let's throw the body away. That's also a crime. Do we burn it in the house or bury it? Those are all crimes. We could be charged for doing those things. What do we do then? I think someone's trying to blame it on us. Your wife probably hates us more than anything right now. Do not drag my wife into this! Don't drag me into this either. You take care of the body. What?! You and I are accomplices. I don't know. I'm tired of everything. I'm tired of it! I don't care. (Dong-sik gets rid of the murder weapon) Are you.. (Dong-sik takes a bath to get rid of the blood stain) Get the body away as far as possible. (Dong-sik leaves to check up on the dead body) Who is it? Honey.. Why is there a dead body here? We just keep bodies here now? I was here since this afternoon. I've seen this man before but I can't remember. Who did this? We have to get rid of it first. Just leave it I will take care of it. We will get caught if you do it. I will do it. I heard a bitch in a house is a bad luck but that one is totally destroying it. Why would you take the responsibility? Because I can do anything and everything for you. I can take all the blames. Men can make one-time mistakes. Did you reflect on your relationship with her while I was gone? Or did you not care since it already happened? Men are easily tempted. That's such a coward thing to say! You think you are the same after having an affair with the maid? That's enough! Are you going to get rid of the body or call the cops on us? Everyone get out I will take care of the body I will carry the weight with you (Jeong-suk starts to get rid of the body as they leave) The eggs are significantly bigger today The feed must have been good last night. Meat is the best for them. What did you do with the body? (Jeong-suk shows where the dead body went) (Myung-ja meets her old friend outside) What happened to you? Looks like you are about to go crazy That bitch is going to kill me You are being too sensitive She's going to feed me to the chickens What? (Myung-ja tries to calm down and gives her friend a letter) Keep this letter and give it to the police if I ever die or disappear. You are being crazy. That bitch is definitely going to kill me. But she will fall into my trap (Myung-ja making rat poison) I can't sleep because of the rats and I wake up in the morning because of the roosters. One bottle can kill up to 100 chickens at once. He said he can't sleep So I gave him sleeping pills but I guess he took too much, he won't wake up. He could've died. I have some leftover rat poison. Maybe I should give it to the chickens. (Jeong-suk stops Myung-ja giving poison to chickens) Chickens aren't the only things that are going to die here. I will kill everyone before I become the chicken feed. (Jeong-suk gets ready for a meal) (She looks for the rat poison) Do I have anything to eat? Yes, we are going to share food Yeah but nothing else. My soup has sugar in it. Do you wanna switch? She fell for it. I knew this was gonna happen so I took action beforehand. I emptied the rat poison bottle and put sugar water in it. So it means she tried to poison my soup with rat poison. You dirty whore. Now you are trying to kill me. Both of you let go! Let go!! Move let go! What's wrong with you two! (Jeong-suk faints) Honey, wake up. (Dong-sik brings Jeong-suk to his room) I'm gonna call the cops on you. She attempted to kill me! You should go back to your parent's place for a bit. Kids must be waiting for you. I know you are fighting for your life but so is Myung-Ja Everyone is crazy now. I'm going to the police. I need you to be my witness. Let's just turn her in and end our relationship too. If I put everything back to normal, will you list my name on your family registry? Have a wedding with me. And give me this house Will you give me everything that you have? You can't? You can't right? I will do everything for you Just don't hurt my wife Your wife has to agree to it too She's a stranger now I didn't take you away from her She offered you to me. (Myung-ja takes Dong-sik away from Jeong-suk) (She brings Dong-sik to her room) Who killed him and why is the body here for everyone to see? The dead person is the manager of the employment agency. We investigated the maid list and your house is the closest. He is known for asking for sex and money from the ladies he found jobs for while holding onto their weakness. I never gave him money or had sex with him But you killed him instead? How can a weak lady break a man's skull? A man did it then! Was it you? The murderer's hand should be covered in blood right now. Let me see your bloody hands! What's wrong with you! Let's go! We have to go! Is there a bowl that you had but that disappeared? A red chinaware No. The piece of red chinaware that stuck on the head of the body. I will find it even if I have to dig everywhere. Where is the red chamber pot? I don't know Did my husband hit the guy with the red chamber pot? He doesn't use the chamber pot. Well, I use it. But he used it to kill the man. I don't believe you! You left the body out there for them to find it I thought you made your chickens eat it Because I had a weird feeling. I wanted the body to be identified, that's why I put it outside. Why are the cops digging in the ground? They are trying to find the piece of the bowl that was stuck on the head of the body. What do you mean? I buried the broken chamber pot. Where? Where? Did I hit a person with that? You didn't kill anyone! I put the body by the riverside so she could get caught! I'm done My life is over It wasn't you! Don't say anything. You can't even kill a chicken, mouse, or insects! I wanted to reveal the truth I want to reveal the truth by telling the detective. No. If not, I will take the blame. You aren't a murderer. No, stop, don't say anything This cannot be blamed on someone else No, no I'm the murderer I don't want to go to jail! I'd rather kill myself.. Let's go Honey. -Darling -What's wrong with you Darling I said move The chamber pot is right there on the side. We are done. They will come here in the morning with a warrant. It will be in the newspaper too. Muderers' faces are always covered though. Like this! Your wife will be handcuffed too. My wife is innocent Still.. I threw away the body. I might run my mouth. I will take responsibility. Your wife will be locked up too. Do not drag my wife into this! But I want to. You want me to take the blame? I'm not trying to say that I'm going to prison. I'm saying you and I are going to die together and go to heaven together. It will solve everything. If you die with me. You and I will be both happy. Who else in the world would die for each other. Your parents, siblings, wife, or girlfriend won't die with you. Let's end it. I forgot we had that choice. Death.. Let's end it. This is not the end. I will serve you forever. It's just I couldn't do it in this world. Did we really just lose the world? We still have each other in our final moments. We will enjoy it. No, you might change your mind after this. You are the only one I have. I should just run away and meet another man. Younger and more passionate What? I told you men go crazy over an eternal triangle. I will never forgive you. Everything happened because of you. Young man I will beat you. I'm a bitch, right? So you shouldn't let me go right? Please teach me to behave. Beat me. Then I will just forget about the young men and just take the rat poison. You bitch! Just take it... Your life is miserable too. You are going to drink it right? You don't sound too strange anymore. It doesn't taste too bad They made it taste good so rats would volunteer to eat it. Maybe I'm no different than a rat. We could be anything now. Dirt, water, wind, or sun. But I'm scared to die! Please let me not feel this moment. Please be with me in my last moment. I wanted to finish this knit. Water Water I have no positive words to put in my testament. I can't stop apologizing to my wife Water Water Where are you going..? I did everything that you asked for. But I want to spend my last moment next to my wife. No, you can't! You may have taken my life but my soul... I cannot give it to you. You can't run away from me even if you die. What are you doing to my testament? What the hell are you doing! You don't need to die next to your wife. Soon, she will be executed and follow us. What! I gave a letter to my friend. for her to give it to the police if I die. I wrote that your wife was the murderer and now she's trying to poison us to death. You are horrible! Die! H, honey! You can't go. You can't Honey H, honey! I was tricked by Myung-Ja and poisoned with rat poison. But if society finds out about me and the maid, I don't know what would happen to the kids. How would they be able to survive in this world? I... Wasn't wise enough.. There is one thing you can do to survive. Just make up a scene Tell them that there was a robber and killed me and the maid. Stab my back with this knife, so it looks like I got killed by a robber Save our honor. Save our kids' honor. Honor.. Save the honor! Here How can I stab my own husband? What do I even think about for me to that? When I got abused by you? or when you beat me? When you ignored me? No, no You were always nice to me. You are my one and only husband. She's lying! She's definitely lying! Go get some rest and come back tomorrow. (The End. Produced by Kim-kiyoung)
