I wanted to come into the garden this morning, I didn't feel like staying in the house. What's wrong? Nothing. - Excuse me. - Yes? I've dropped my lighter and I can't find it. - Can you come inside? - Yes, sir. I'm coming. Don't try anything funny! Just give me the money and you'll be fine. It didn't work this time, you smart-ass! Put it down. Lift your arms up slowly... Madam, call the police. Put the phone down! VIOLENT TURIN Idiot! You always have to shoot, don't you! It should have been simple... You don't know me, or us! You don't know who we are! You're lucky this time... I brought you the money you asked for. Wait... the negatives? Here are your negatives. What's wrong? This wasn't our deal... I brought the money, you must give me what's mine! Don't worry, you'll get what's yours! On a tip-off we went to Via Cossa by Pellerina Park and we found a young woman's body. Seems she was killed by stabs to the stomach. The documents refer to a Marta Serafini, married to Doctor Guido Borletti. Inspector Leoni asks that a car be sent to 28 Via Chiesa Della Salute to get Dr. Borletti. Message received, car 9. Dr. Borletti to be picked up as requested. Not bad for one night, eh? First the cinema, then the Pellerina woman. Think they're professionals? - Who? - The cinema robbers. It was well-organized, but the fact they used a gun unnecessarily makes you think they're amateurs. I know what some people deserve! Frizzieri, don't talk crap. We're not in the Wild West any more... and avenging angels are out of fashion. Back then they could be excused because there was no law. You're probably right, but since the arrival of this 'avenger', as the papers call him, some garbage has been swept away, right? Yes that's true, but that's no reason to tolerate it, my dear Frizzieri. What would happen if everyone did the same? We'd be out of a job, for a start. Let's go and find some coffee. Come on! Run! Run here, run there! There's no peace around here! Same thing every night. - Can't you go somewhere else to cause trouble? - Hi, Daniele. Always on the go, eh? Hey, you! For what! Some tarts and tramps?! Come here for a second... Brigadier, I'm going to work. Smooth clean hands, gabardine overcoat, smart face... Take him away. Let me go... Let me go. Take this gentleman away. A friend of yours? For a long time! Zebra 27, headquarters here. Zebra 27 here, over. Anything on Franco Solari? Nothing to report. Don't move! No... You can't... NIGHT MURDER IN THE PELLERINA Body of stabbed woman found Moron! Watch where you're going or next time I'll run you over! Have you seen today's paper? No, why? Don't you recognize her? Looks like the girl who was with us that day. Yes, it's her. And now she's dead. Do you think they killed her? You don't? Listen, I don't want to go on. Why not? Because of Marta? Whatever happened to her, she must have deserved it... How can you talk like that? And what have you got to complain about? Haven't you always agreed? You've even learned to talk like them... If I'm involved it's thanks to you. Anyway, I want you to be the first to know that I want nothing more to do with them. I want out while I still can. Are you mad? Do you want to end up the same way?! That's dangerous. Those people don't fool around... Hey, you two! Finished chatting? We're waiting for you. We're coming. We'll talk later. A waste of time: I won't change my mind. POLICE HEADQUARTERS 6 robberies, 10 assaults, plus 4 murders... two of which seem like executions. There's not much to be cheerful about... and there are still people who say that Turin's not the Italian crime capital. Gentlemen, I want results fast, and I expect the most from you, Moretti. Let me remind you of the Frenchman's case: As you'll recall, Pierre Simoni was forced to leave town when the Marseilles gang was put out of business. Simoni risked death by coming back to Turin. He'd had death threats, but it seems he didn't take them seriously, and now we have one more problem. Maybe Simoni thought he'd been forgotten. Colasanti, you should know the gang never makes empty threats, and Simoni must have known too, because he hid for two years, and then he returned secretly... It would be interesting to know why he risked his life. You think the French are trying to get back into the action here? Possibly. I smell drugs... Let's not forget that the hard drugs trade has often been based in Turin. And what about Franco Solari? It was an underworld execution, that's all! I don't want to hear anything about 'avengers', clear? Moretti's responsible for the Frenchman case and this case gets top priority! Gentlemen, I'm expecting results... positive results. This is headquarters. Robbery at the Big Supermarket. Beta 7 and Savona 2 go to zone 8 Beta 7: Message received. Go! Savona 2: Go to Corso Grosseto... Bloody hell, it's the pigs! Come on, you bastard! Come on! I've had enough of you! DELL' ORCO GALLERY - How's it going? - Fine. Read what they said about us in the papers. Yes, I think you're right. Rosi? Excuse me for a second. "Criminal's car crashes into petrol station which explodes. The tragic result: 6 dead". It's them... What a way to die. Well, it serves them right... they didn't want me any more. Yes, alright. Send two phonograms immediately. Yes... get the family to Turin as quickly as possible. The usual procedure. Okay, I'm counting on you. Goodbye. The same people who did the cinema? Yes, they've been identified. God knows how they were identified. I heard about the officers and the passerby. Don't talk about it, it was a bad morning. Calleri, the shop owner, and two men in the hospital. But there were three in the car. What happened to the fourth one? We'll catch him too, you'll see. If he's got a clean record it'll be hard to find him. Anything new on the Frenchman? Nothing yet. The usual checks. We're seeing loads of people, but... putting the screws on the underworld will bring something out. If that's what you think, I believe you. We've worked together for years, and you've kept all your promises till now. Your service record's an example to us all. There's just one small flaw in your glorious career... You know what I'm talking about? Yeah, that avenger son of a bitch. The press inflating it was all we needed... but let's forget it. You're right... he shouldn't be mentioned within these walls, the boss doesn't like it. I'm off duty tonight, but you know where to find me... but try not to! Bye. Just one thing: If Dr. Borletti's here, show him in. Sure. Dr. Borletti? In here please. Please make yourself comfortable, doctor. Good morning, inspector. Need some time to make up your mind? If you're not up to it today I can say you're sick. I don't need more time. When you see them tell them I want a meeting. I'll be at the usual place. Whatever. Sometimes you're as stubborn as a mule. To be honest, those people scare me. Why not say they're useful to you? And we both know why... Hello? Yes, it's me. Borletti, sir. Yes, I've just come out. Everything's fine. I did as you asked. Well done, Borletti. As I explained, it's pointless casting further doubts on events... Nobody can bring your wife back to life. But don't you think I should have mentioned the large bank withdrawal? No, they'd have jumped to conclusions. I'm thinking of your career... But I want my wife's murderer to pay the price. That's what we all want, but it might not happen, so don't you think it's pointless to risk it? Borletti, take my advice, it's in your best interests. You're right... And thanks. That'll be your father saying he'll be late again. Yes? Oh hi, Elena, how are things? No, Maria's here. Yes, she got home over two hours ago. Wait, I'll ask her. When did you leave Sandra? About 5. She says at about 5. Alright. No problem. Bye. Looks like Sandra hasn't gotten home yet, and Elena's starting to worry, of course. RYUGI GYM RYUGI TURIN Hi Lucia, how are you? Hi Ugo, good to see you. Actually, it's not good to see you. If you're here, it's because you need him, right? Right, but don't blame me. Sarti's ill, so... So it's down to me. Can't you tell them you couldn't find him? - No. - No... First the job, then training, then the job again... Our love's become purely platonic, and we only do it over the phone... Do you know what I'm thinking? That both of you can go to hell! Hi. They've found a murdered girl in Vallette, they need us. I'll have a shower and I'll be with you. Is Lucia in the bar? She left, after telling us exactly where we could go... Inspector. So, what have you got for me? A guard was doing the rounds before closing and found the girl's body. Hi Moretti. - Hi. - Nasty business, eh? Right, it always is when we meet. Well? She was strangled with wire after being raped. Know what I think? It shouldn't be us who catches the bastard... I mean he deserves a worse death than hers. Doctor, keep your opinions to yourself. You think so? Well, I've got a daughter of the same age. Well, well... Home already? On strike tonight, are we? I thought you'd already be asleep. Yeah, and I was stupid to wait up for you. You're stupid because you love me. Come on, you know what my job's like. Let's not argue tonight. I need you. I'm sorry love, I was too hard on you. Let's go up and you can tell me what happened. I should be used to it by now, but... if you'd have seen her... ...she was no more than 17 years old. If I ever get my hands on whoever killed her... Stop it. Don't think about it any more. I love you. I know, my love. And I know you pay the price. You hate my job, and I swear I do sometimes too. When you start out you have big ideas of the way things should be, but when you understand the reality, it's too late. Yes, I know, you'll say I should quit, but what else could I do? Sell insurance or be a traveling salesman? Start again from scratch? No, I don't want to. On the other hand, I don't like feeling what I feel. Whereas I'm happy. Happy? Why? Because you've just proved you've not become completely callous, and I hope you never do. There he is. Look! Go on, follow him! No. We'll take care of them later. I know them. Did they hurt you? - I saw it all. They're delinquents! - Scoundrels! Mr. Perrenne, I'm really sorry. Are you hurt? No, they hit me on the head so I've just got a headache. Come with me. We'll call the police. We'll see what we can do about your case. No thanks. It'll just be a waste of time and I can't delay my departure. But thanks for your concern, and goodbye. My pleasure, Mr. Perrenne, and have a good trip. Goodbye. Where to, sir? To the air club. TURIN AIR CLUB Good morning, Mr. Perrenne. No luggage this time? Unfortunately, but I'll explain when we're airborne. Let's go. 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... Now! Now let's take care of the other two. Jean Perrenne and Pierre Simoni were trying to find their place in the sun here in Turin. But, it seems, just for themselves, given that the French police have said that their gang fell apart over a year ago. That doesn't mean they couldn't have regrouped with new people. Moretti, you're the one who has to answer all the questions. How long was he in Turin? Where did he stay? You won't believe it, but Perrenne stayed in a hotel here for 4 days. Oh, but that's outrageous! Somebody will swing for this, for Christ's sake! Come in! I'm sorry, but the hotel manager's here. I thought you should see him too. Good idea. Show him in. Good morning, gentlemen. Take a seat, Mr. Carilli. What can you tell us about Perrenne? Oh, I see. So he made a charge? He said he was in a hurry to leave. What charge? Wasn't it you who worked on a bag-snatch a while ago by a pair of brothers with a big bike? One had a beard. Yeah, we let them go because there was no proof. I don't care about that. Get me names and addresses right now. Open up! Police! Come outside! We know you're in. Come on, lads... Over here, inspector. Bloody hell... Is it them, Daniele? I'm afraid so. Someone got here before us. You search the rest of the flat. You call the flying squad. Take a look around. We've got to find a brown briefcase. Did they know what they'd got hold of? Think it's drugs? Maybe. Come here for a minute. Seems like drugs. I think I know what happened. One of the people we're looking for was following Perrenne and saw these two make the snatch. Hey, take a look at these. Well, well... You and that shit Moretti are going to stop giving us grief... Give him this from me! And this is from me! It's incredible! Are you sure they're not fakes? Believe it. They're real. Aside from saddening me, these photos surprise me. I know... I knew my wife well, and you could define her as 'frigid' in the true sense of the word. Seeing her in these photos, you'd understand... Yes, of course. But, as I've already said, you mustn't forget that drugs are involved in this. As a doctor you know better than anyone the effects they can cause. Why didn't you tell me your wife made the withdrawal the day she was killed? How did you find out? It doesn't matter anyway. I didn't connect it to her death. Your wife was obviously being blackmailed using those photos. Why didn't you tell us? Marta's death upset me, and I followed my lawyer's advice. Oh, what a great lawyer! I want to meet him straight away. Don't jump to conclusions. I've known my lawyer for years. We've been friends a long time. And if he gave me that advice, it was to protect me. I'm sure you're right. But he definitely slowed down our investigation. And you can be sure that he'll have to explain himself. Hello? For a second I thought you weren't going to answer. No... I just got in. Did you hear what happened to the girl? Yes. If you don't want something to happen to you, behave yourself. It'll be better all round. And you can always count on getting your stuff. Understand? Yes. Sure. That sonofabitch lawyer. I'd like to have given him a hard time. Talking of lawyers, Loretta phoned me. She said she wants you to sign some papers. She can send them to my lawyer. That's what I pay him for. She wants to see you, you blockhead! That's what you think. And I don't have the time anyway. Yes you have. We'll do this: You drive there and I'll get her. You've got to eat, haven't you? Today you can make an effort and eat with her. Listen Cupid, why don't you mind your own business... Lets go into town and see what's happening. - Here you are. - Thanks. COSSOLO CAKES - Yes? - A Crodino and an Averna bitter. A Crodino and an Averna bitter. Well? Looks like there's going to be a big shots' meeting tonight. Think it's about the French? I hope so. We've made life difficult for them. Something's got to give. Talking of which, how are you getting on with that girl? Sandra's brother, Walter, is convinced that her schoolfriend, Maria, knows more than she's said so far. A tail should be put on her because she's our only lead. FURS by IDA BRERO Hi Daniele. Well? MULETTO'S RESTAURANT How are things, Ugo? You've already asked me. Sorry. It's always been hard for us to talk. - It's obvious we've got nothing to say. - That's not true! It wasn't always like that. If things changed it wasn't my fault. Let's not start again... I don't want to argue with you. You didn't want to forgive me, did you? I couldn't forgive you... which is different. And you know why. When I met him I didn't know he was a crook. It was you who found that out! It's my job. Your job, your job... I've heard you say that a million times! But you didn't kill him just because it was your job! I didn't meant to say that. Please don't be angry. Daniele's a good friend to you. He wants us to be together. If only I could be a part of your life, alongside your job, I would be contented. Let's not talk bollocks. For once, the police guessed right. And those Frenchies were trying to make monkeys out of us. Alright, yes, someone stopped them... But who, I ask myself? And why? Don Nicola, what makes you think we're involved? I'm not making any accusations, at least for now... But you must agree that if the Frenchies didn't have help in town they'd never have risked coming back. And you know exactly why... The only explanation is that someone from outside helped them. Who'd have risked it! I want to know! Right away! Let's be clear. We all agreed how to divide up the town, and since we got rid of the French and the Tunisians, things have gone smoothly. We've never trod on each others' toes, and I don't think anyone wants to start having problems now. Our business is being upset by the police, because of this thing. This mess has got to be sorted out as quickly as possible! - Good night Don Nicola. - Be good. Sons of bitches... if they're trying to take me for a ride I'll blow them all away! I hope you're wrong, Don Nicola. We don't need a gang war... we'd be playing into the police's hands. I know! Take me home. C.C.R. RIVOLESI CARAVAN CENTRE Please, try to understand... it's my job. It's important. Okay... Alright, we won't mention it again. What are you doing here? I was looking for you. How are you, inspector? Or should I call you 'avenger'? Shut up, you bastard. I'll take care of you too. I've been asking myself why you haven't already. You know who I am, what I do. But I thought you can't do it because the gang's protecting me and nobody can touch me. That's why. Lit won't always be that way. I can wait. Sooner or later they won't need you any more. Know what I think? What I do is, after all, specialized work. But what satisfaction do you get from yours? Not even fame because - obviously - nobody can know. That's a real shame. You're kidding yourself if you think you're a hero. Know why? Because you're not a hero, you're a bastard. More so than me. That's why you do it. - Have you finished? - No. You're looking for a fight. And I want the same thing. Maybe you won't have to wait long. - Really? - I'll catch you off-guard. Whatever, but it won't be easy to surprise me. The time will come. You can be sure of it... Sergio Donati? Hello, inspector. Are you looking for me? You know who I am? Sure. Don't you remember me? I was younger when we met in my father's house. Well, now you're going to pay for the Idea Cinema manager's death. Yes? Just a second. They want you. Yes? Alright, I'll be right there. What the fuck are you doing here this late? You're not even on duty. What was I supposed to do? They got me out of bed. What a shitty profession... Something strange has happened. They've killed the fourth cinema robber. A certain Donati, but he didn't die immediately. And here's the strange thing: He asked to talk to me. We both knew him, or at least we knew his parents. Don't tell me he's General Donati's son! That's him. And what did he want to tell you? I'll never know. He was dead when I got to the hospital. It's a real shame. I feel sorry for him. But I'm even sorrier for his parents. He was identified, right? Yes. There's no doubt. Hi Daniele. We're ready when you are, Moretti. I'm coming. Why don't you go back to bed? Ugo, who could have killed the boy? An accomplice, who else? But if they're all dead? There must have been others. Couldn't it have been the avenger? I see the stuff in the papers has got to you. But does the avenger exist or not? I'll believe it when I see him. Bye. Hey, you arrived at the right time! These packages are heavy. Give me a hand. ALCHOHOL-FREE CRODINO. THE LIGHT APERITIF I'm telling you they're out of control. If we don't stop them they'll slaughter each other, and our investigation won't gain anything either. Alright. Speak to you later. Bye. Walter, could I have a second, please? Good morning, Manfredi. What's up? I'm sorry to bother you, but please let me offer my condolences. Thank you. You're very kind. Can I help you in some way? I'm in a bit of a rush. I understand, but I wanted to talk about Sandra. I know this might not be the best time but, well... I need to recoup... Recoup? I don't understand. Can you explain? Well, the day of that disgraceful event I lent Sandra some money. And now I need to find some way of recouping it. Let's keep it brief. How much did you lend my sister? Well... I don't know how she managed to convince me... but Sandra said she really needed it, and I gave her... a million. What?! Yes, I know I shouldn't have, but... I did. You bastard! Assuming it's true, I want to know why you lent a million to a girl of 17! I tried to explain, I told him the truth. You must believe me. I didn't want to give her all that money but she was very convincing... You dirty bastard! - You can't talk about my sister like that! - Sit down! How can I make you believe that she seduced me?! She wasn't a little innocent... Take him away. How could anyone believe such a thing? He might have killed her to stop her reporting him. If only things were that simple... Unfortunately, I think his story's true. What do you mean? I would have called you in tomorrow to show you these, but you're here now... Look at them, then you'll understand. Oh, thanks. Don't think I don't understand you. Your sister couldn't have been killed just for the photos. She was obviously involved in something more dangerous, and the photos are just a part of the story. You can help us reconstruct your sister's life in her last months. If we get our hands on her killer this whole business can be closed. And what will happen to that pig, Manfredi? Unless you file a complaint - and what's the point? - I don't think we could prosecute him. I'm sorry, but that's how it is. I'll give you some advice: Forget him. In a certain sense, he was also the victim of circumstance. Think about helping me instead. MAURO & WALTER'S LONG PLAY BANK BLOCKHOUSE DANCE HALL Edgar Allan Poe, the great genius of both poetry and prose in the last century, knew how to create strange melodies with that ancient lute known as the English language. Yes? Hello? The newest and most fascinating melodies are in "Tales of Mystery and Imagination" by Alan Parsons, who being a clever businessman, realized the importance and sale ability of Poe's work. The public love horror stories and films like "King Kong", "Psycho" and "Earthquake". Anyway, it was worthwhile... Hey, didn't you say you wanted to have a chat? Listen, you stupid bitch, I'll kill you if you don't tell me what happened! What do you mean? What are you talking about?! I've seen the photos and I know everything! Everything, you whore! And I know it was your fault! You fool! I can't say anything, they'd kill me! They won't need to, because I'll kill you first. But if you're smart, you'll tell me what happened. If not, you'll just cause more trouble! - Come on! - No... Come on, talk! Talk, you whore! A year ago, before Christmas, Sandra and I went to a party. It was nothing unusual. There were lots of people. They gave us loads to drink. I don't know exactly what happened. I've never known. Then I found myself in a room with a man. Sandra was on the other side of the room. She was with a man too. They took advantage of us... At first I thought things would end there, but they turned up again a few days later. They'd taken photos while they took advantage of us, and that's how they forced us to meet others who were then secretly photographed too, and then... and then blackmailed. They did whatever they wanted with us. You swine! You'll pay! You'll all pay for this! That's enough, Walter. That's enough. You did a good job. Now it's our turn. Follow my car. ...is wanted by his office. Inspector Moretti is wanted by his office. I see. That's the outline of the story. Now you've got to fill in the details. Names, addresses, everything you know. They'll kill me, they'll kill me! That's true... Unless we catch them first, get it? I don't want to say anything else. They'll kill you anyway. You've said too much already. Don't you realize that if you'd have talked earlier Sandra would probably still be alive? No! Come in. Why are you here? I told you to avoid me! I don't want anyone to see you here! You have no idea how happy I am to see you again, my dear lawyer friend. We've got a lot to talk about, but this time at headquarters. Take her away. Don't be over-confident, inspector. You can only accuse me of having relations with a minor. - Look, I won't allow you... - Sir! Marta Borletti... Don't get any funny ideas... I loved that woman, and I'm not involved in her death. Who blackmailed her? We were both blackmail victims. - Yes. It's her. I'm certain. - Fine. Take her to the car. I'll be back in a minute. Damn! I've finished my cigarettes. I'll be right back. - Regina? - Yes? I've got to talk to you. I'm sorry, but If you want an appointment I'm very busy. I believe you. I'm with the police. I swear I don't know them. I know how it works, but nothing else. They have photos to blackmail us, but the worst thing is that they're the only people who can supply drugs at a good price. That they're the only people who can supply drugs at a good price. In exchange they organize meetings that are a bit... special. Most of the time we don't even know who we're dealing with. I know they make good money in two ways: From the meetings and from the drugs they sell. Because all our clients get a taste for drugs eventually. Could you show me one of the places where you meet? No, I couldn't. It's a different place every time. How's contact made? By phone. It's always them who calls us. They give you an address, that's all. You get there and your dope's ready and waiting for you. By the time you recover it's all over. Now, if you don't mind, I'll get my things and go. As I said earlier, I'm very busy. Are you hurt? It's nothing, I'm fine. Hey, what's wrong with you? Where the fuck have you been, you idiot? Maria's dead because of you! Come on, you jerk, get in! I've got to catch them! Hello? Daniele? Can you hear me? What's going on? Maria's been murdered while I was in the theater. Walter left her alone for a few minutes. They also tried to kill the dancer. I recognized one of them: Piero Bos?. Have they spotted you? No, at least not yet. I'll ask headquarters for reinforcements. Whatever, but it won't be easy to surprise me. The time will come. You can be sure of it... Is it really necessary to leave town? I told you, he saw my face. Do you prefer to wait here and see what happens? Why now, for Christ's sake, when things were working themselves out?! Who was that man with Maria? I don't know. Sandra's brother, I think. Calling all cars, this is Beta 5. I'm positioned in Via Pomba, on the corner of Via dei Mille. They've stopped at number 14. Received. On our way. Good. Over and out. We've got them in the palm of our hands! Where's he gone? See? You've given me my opportunity... Enjoying yourself? I'm a policeman, and I need your bike. - What?! - Since being nice hasn't worked... Stop thief! Policeman!? Send two cars and an ambulance, over. Understood. Will do. Over and out. Cars 2 and 27 go to 14 Via Pomba where you will rendezvous with Inspector Moretti. What a mess... Not only did we catch those two, but we got the others to kill each other. Amusing, don't you think? Obviously not... What's been eating you recently? I don't want to talk about it. The hospital doctor told me Sergio was still alive when you arrived. I know you know. And is that all you've got to say to me? Don't expect any explanations or excuses, I'm not the type. So what type are you, Ugo? I've known you for years, and I'd never have thought... Spare me your acts of friendship. See you tomorrow, bye. Where do you think you're going? How are you going to work this out? There's nothing to work out. Things will just go on as they have done, for everyone's good. And I'm sure you'll keep quiet because it's in your interests that someone cleans things up! It doesn't finish here, Ugo. So you can shoot as well... It was self-defense. That's how it started for me too... Hello headquarters? Inspector Daniele here...
