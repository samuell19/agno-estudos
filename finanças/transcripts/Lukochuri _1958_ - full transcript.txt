Where did l put them? - Buddhu. - Coming, father. - We'll be late. - Coming. l don't remember. Life is little, little is pain. Little, little are sorrows. Certainly very easy and simple.

Bigger than our Jabalpur. lt's still not decided where you'll live there. lf the transfer could be avoided somehow... lt's a job, what could be done? You don't worry, father. - Everything will be all right. - Just saying don't worry... isn't enough. lt would be better if you put up... - at Jagodish's place. - No, father, he's your friend. - l'm not known to him at all. - So what? l've written to him.

You get ready by then. - Brother, what's the name of this place? - Cadell Road. - Cadell Road. Where is Shivaji Park? - Nearby. Why?

Otherwise l'd have to toil in the kitchen. l'm already dying with joint pain. Look, look at your mother's histrionics. Buddhu isn't coming. lsn't it bad news? Of course it's bad news. Of course. - Hey. - What? - Who's Buddhu? l don't know. Of course he is Buddhu (fool). Otherwise, why have such a stupid name? Damn it! Oh my God. So soon it's ten thirty. lt's not the clock's fault. lt's right on time. You're having fun. The people who don't need to go to the office... they're fortunate.

Editing is going on. - Meaning? - Alteration going on. - l don't understand. - l'm copying another's song. lt requires great skill. - lf you don't get caught. - There's no harm even if l'm caught. These days no one wants the original stuff. And moreover now l have eighteen movies in hand. Where's the time to think so much? So you're working by dozens? - lndeed, indeed. l had been doing functions for free means in repentence. Recently one of my movies became a hit. - Now the market is mine. - Yes, indeed. - You've composed a tune for my song? - l've got a new idea. Modern song means mixture. At the beginning a folk tune. This is so unique. That's what's popular. Give the harmonium, fast. Play the tabla. (musical instrument) Oh my friends, don't come with me today My Lord is calling with the flute - My friends. - My friends Aha, wonderful. All right, all right. Oh my friends, don't come with me today My Lord is calling with the flute lt's all right. Fine. My Lord is calling with the flute - The magical flute is playing. - No, no, no, no. lt's not like that, it's not like that. Here it's poetic. Here l have put a twist.

You have to struggle a little, at first. - Did you get support from home? - No. - Did you write a letter yourself? - l asked brother to. Oh. - Have you told them at home? - No. l will today. Well, Gita, you never wanted to know about my family? l came to know you. But you weren't interested in my family, either. l'll marry you, not your family. And then the doors of my house are closed for me. - Everything will be all right. - Nothing will happen. Since l entered into movies, there are no relations with home. lt got worse, after they learned l'm marrying a girl of my choice. You could have married a girl of their choice. Then you would have had a beautiful lovely wife. - And that would've been better? - Yes. Well then, you also marry a handsome boy. The boy l'll marry, seems very handsome to me. And the girl l'll marry, seems very beautiful to me. Then l would have known, you really love me. - l love you? Who told you that? - Aha. Then who do you love? - Who do l love? - Who? Magical playful deer in the forest The one who gives rise to sweet dreams... why should l capture it for no reason? Put your wishes away. l will fill my heart... with the tune of the function for no reason Magical playful deer in the forest There will be lightning in the wind of the monsoon The sky will become overcast with clouds The heart will get restless for no reason l will ask to be away, and will tie a string of separation in secret That bond will be free of any bondage for no reason Magical playful deer in the forest The one who gives rise to sweet dreams... why should l capture it for no reason? Sorry. Thank you. Damn! - Tea for you, sir. - Oh, give me. Give me. - Today you gave up dhoti and put on pants, sir. - What? - l wear pants everyday. - No, no, sir, don't joke with me. Joke? Oh yes, understood. Look, l am Buddhu. - Buddhu. - Hey, sir l am Buddhu. - Look, man, my name is Buddhu and... Your name is Buddhu. l'm going, sir. Look. Hey, Shankar make him explain.

Bihari, younger. - Younger? - No elder. - Elder? - Bihari, younger. - Elder. - Elder, elder, younger. - Bihari, elder. Wait, wait, wait, don't get me confused. From now on l'll call you Mr. Dhoti and you, you... l'll call you Mr. Pants. Oh God, everything is so messy here. - So, brother new job. How is it? - Don't ask about the job. - The job was about to go today. - Why? What why? Because of your Bombay bus. - Bus? - Yes, yes, bus. lf the bus comes the turn doesn't come. lf the turn comes then a girl comes. - Girl? - Girl. That's why l was told in the office... You are too early for tomorrow. l see. So you were late because of a girl? - Yes, for a girl. And she's not any ordinary girl. She laughs like this. And looks like this. And walks like this. Well, finally you got settled. Don't be nervous. At first one has to bear a couple of blows. This isn't a flat race. lt's a hurdle race. - You speak like a learned man. - l'm much experienced in this. lt's time for me to retire. You retired, sir. Salute, sir. Salute. So you heard everything, Rita. Now tell me, what shall l do? Mother has to be told about the marriage. - But who will tell her? - lt's your marriage so, l'll have to. Come on, go to sleep. l'll tell her tomorrow. l am sitting in wait, singing the song of monsoon. - As much as l think... - Hey, what is it you can't forget? You know, sister? Today l was running late for work... so l jumped ahead of a man to enter the bus. Oh my. On reaching the office, l see that man... has been transferred into our office. Very funny man. Sometimes he recognizes me and fumes in anger. Sometimes he pretends not, and hangs his head like this. - Very foolish. - The matter is serious. - Hey listen, what should l do? - Forget it. lf l start hearing, the night will fly. The start is dangerous. lt takes time to forget. Now go to sleep. The sky started showering nectar The whole mad world is drowning in the rays Wow, the song is so nice. Today you'll find everything nice. Look Rauma's mother. Whatever l give the cook he'll ruin. l don't like this. - Mother. - What? - Mother. - Say what you want to say. Rauma's mother, give this to the cook. Tell him to cook it well. l was saying, sister likes someone, and wants to marry him. She chose herself? So what does the boy do? - He sings. - Sings. Skilled boy. So how much does he earn? l just told you, he sings for records, for radio, for cinema. He sings for cinema? Humph, l know how good a boy he is. - Father. - Yes? - Father, sister wants to marry. - That's good, very good. lt's very happy news. - But, mother doesn't agree. - What? What a problem. - lt's very difficult, dear. - So what can be done?

Oh, yes, yes. - Ticket please. - Last stop. - He bought your ticket. - Who? - That gentleman. Listen, l mean if l hadn't, l'd have been late. - Please don't mind. - No, l don't mind. l'm Kumar Chaudhary. And you're Ms... Not Ms., Rita Devi. Oh, that means Mrs.? No, no, l don't like being addressed as Ms in the English style. Oh. Say that, l thought that... - So you had thought about me before this? - Yes. - What? - l mean no, l mean yes. No means yes. Yes means should l, Mister? - Look, again, again mister... - Oh, l shouldn't say that? Fine. No, no, of course you may. Say a hundred times, thousand times, million times. - l understood. We'll be late today also, come. - Come. Hands like lotus, Ah ha, ha... - l see you'll ruin the company, Tarun. - Brother, l'm in big trouble. Why, what happened now? Look, is it hands like lotus or gifted feet? Hand like lotus means a slap, understand? - And gifted feet means kick. - Kick? l see your job is at risk. - No, no nothing, l didn't mind anything, Mr... - Again, Mr.? l'll say Mr. only. - Then it's fine. -You weren't late today, right? - You saved me. This is already on, many chapters to come. - Chapters? - Yes. - Brother, more chapters will come? - What do you mean by 'will come'? This is just the beginning. - 0h yes, Madam? - Shivaji Park. - Your ticket is paid. - Who? - That lady. - Listen, you paid my ticket. - lt wasn't unjust at all. - Why? - Do you know, 'fire, enemy and debt shouldn't be forgotten'? - Okay, greetings. - Greetings. Listen, which way are you going? - Most likely, different from yours. - Oh. - And you? - Most likely, different from yours. Mother is very stubborn. What should l do? What should l say? l'm helpless as well. - Let's go somewhere else. - That can't be done, Gita. lf we go somewhere else, l'll have to look for another job. But you'll certainly get a job. You really know music. l do know. That's why l'm scared l won't find one. - Why? - These days real things have no value. - Then? - Then, both of us will have to try our best. l don't know what will happen. But l'll wait for you. - You? - Do l have to tell you? Don't you know? - Greetings. Did you mind? - No, no, no, l didn't mind at all. - You are Ms... - No. Rita Devi. - What, that means Mrs? - No... l don't like to be addressed as Ms in the English style. Very good, very good. But buying my ticket wasn't unjust at all. Of course not. Certainly not. Not at all. From now on, you buy my ticket every day. Understand, Rita Devi? Hey, Rita Devi. Go away, Mr. Kumar. A little glimpse at a blink. A little glimpse at a blink lf it happens a little more, what's the harm? lf the day passes away by sitting side by side... and share the emotions, what's the harm? lt feels good to reply to the mischief of a sweet smile Let the days pass away by filling up the heart... with sweet dreams, what's the harm? A little glimpse at a blink, if it happens... a little more, what's the harm? lf the day passes away by sitting side by side... and share our feelings, what's the harm? Now that suddenly we got introduced on the way... if the hesitation goes away it will be good While pretending to avoid, she gets caught... by the gestures, only by the gestures. lf my heart swings with the excitement... of getting something, what's the harm? A little glimpse at a blink, if it happens... lf it happens a little more, what's the harm? lf the day passes away by sitting side by side... and share our feelings, what's the harm? - Playing with puppets? - No, playing with fire. You know, Shankar, l was introduced to that girl. Suddenly both met one day. Suddenly both got introduced one day. Suddenly both fell in love one day. And someone suddenly got separated one day. - What's the matter? You look upset. - No, nothing. Gita, that man is very clever. What, your opinion changed in just one day? - A girl's heart, what a strange thing. - Ah, listen to me. Today when buying the ticket on the bus the conductor said... he'd bought the ticket for me. Oh my. When l turned around l saw the fool... waving my ticket. l was stunned. - Then? - Later l came to know he got into the bus by lying. Then he was so keen on asking for forgiveness, Gita. Forgiving is the best policy. Certainly you forgave him? What to do? l had to forgive him finally. l had to. Everyone is very clever before falling in love. But after falling in love, one becomes a moron. Just like you, l guess? Damn. No, there's no shirt worth wearing. Have to buy some. lt happens during the first days after getting this disease. lt never feels that the dressing up is as the heart wishes. But later, when one's more experienced one manages even in torn clothes. One manages. Am l thinking of new clothes for that? There isn't a single one worth wearing, that's why. Yes indeed. Just these few shirts. These can't be worn. But who'll pack them up? - Bring the person who'll pack them. - l'll give you a punch. Wait, wait. lf you go buy new clothes now you'll be late for work. l'll go and buy. Thank you. - Here you are, mister. l mean... - No need to mean anything. - Then what should l say? - No need to say anything. Here, your color box, stencil, eraser. - But why are you so angry? - Uncivilized. - What, who? - Who else, that same man. Outside the office he pretends he doesn't know me. - Oh, hurt ego? - What nonsense. l'll leave. l'll be late for work. Minus four thousand two hundred, the remaining... - Please explain to me. - What shall l explain? - l can't do it. - What is it? - l don't know. - What don't you know? - Leave. - For where, how far? How far will you take me, beautiful girl? Where would l get your golden company? Wonderful. Wonderful, dear. Two thousand five hundred... Listen, dear. Explain nicely. Explain to her nicely. But, Keshavda l don't understand anything at all. - You don't understand? - No. - You'll understand very well. - Greetings. - Greetings. Hey! How come only one? Where's the other one? - Other one? - Here comes the other one. - Brother? - You don't understand, it's ego chapter? The lady has an ego problem. Oh my friends, don't come with me today My Lord is calling with the flute Okay. - So, what's the news, brother? - Yes, all's good. - Satish, who sang the song? - A new boy. - l see. - Stishda, how was it? - You sang very well, Shankar. Only you say so. No one else says. - Who said no one else? - Of course. The biggest proof is... my pocket is empty like a field. Well, let me introduce. This is the producer, Mr. Poddar. - Greetings. - Greetings. And the director, Mr. Mukherjee. - Greetings. - Greetings. - Your song was very nice. - Very good. l'm considering you for our next movie. - You're considering means? - lt means l'll give you... - a chance in our next movie. - Are you kidding me? No, no why should we? - No l mean, it's the matter of movie... - No, no. Come and see me in the studio tomorrow. - So, you got it. - Greetings. - Listen. Listen. - Are you calling me? - Why should l call you? - But you said 'listen'? - But not to you. - You didn't mention any name... so 'listen' applies to me also. - What to say? - Brother? - Vinnie, vittie, vissie. - Meaning? - Came, saw, made it vanish. - Whom, brother? The whole family, dear, the whole family. The whole family? You're strange, as if you don't recognize me today. - Me or you? - You, of course. Pretending as if you don't know me at all. - Strange, did l pretend? - Yes. lt's difficult to understand your moods. l'm always in a good mood. Forgive me if l've made any mistake. - Do you understand? - No, brother. Sinking, sinking drinking water. Sinking, sinking drinking water means what? Going on under cover, going on under cover, understand? - What? - Come. You remain lost in a book day and night. Oh my, the window is still open. l've said so many times to close the window... before sleeping at night, but who cares. When you catch cold then l'll have to suffer. l asked Gita to get married. She said she wouldn't. - Hey, do you hear me? - Yes, yes, yes. She's started painting and is staying awake all night. - Good, good. - What's good? You spoiled them by pampering. - Who? - Who else, your daughters. Rita started working at the office so desperately... as if there's no food to eat at home. - Will you marry them off or not? - Why? What why? These days the boys and girls have started... - to fall in love before marriage. - Who? - Who else, your daughter, daughter. - Which one? Ah, you're so irritating. Gita, my dear Gita. Now it's the elder one. Don't be surprised by anything in this field. - Six of my movies have flopped. - Flopped? You're surprised? But the rate grows day by day. - Greetings. - Greetings. - Which movie are you working in? - Ask in which movies. - Twenty two of them. - Twenty two of them? - l'm here in the title role of Soroshi. - Soroshi. - Box office. - Oh. - l'm in demand all over. - Of course, of course.

Well, brother, to be or not to be that scene has to be kept. All right, all right. l told you, don't be surprised over anything in this business. But without being surprised l... - He's arrived. - Greetings. Oh, sit down, sit down. The songs must be ready within seven days. Can you do that? - Within seven days? - Yes.

Today's market price, Gold twenty five rupees, silver hundred rupees. Gold twenty five rupees, silver hundred rupees? You won't let go without spoiling this radio. Move, move. Oh my, it's off.

You don't need to worry at all. l have lot of vacation time. lf l don't go today, there's no harm. lt's okay for you, but that poor fellow... That very clever, very foolish man? As if l'm concerned for him. - My heart is lost. l guess it's lost. - Enough, enough. lf it gets lost, l'll search and find it. You sleep now. Madam hasn't come yet. My goodness.

But what's... the connection of chewing gum with this, brother? There is, there is. Chewing gum tastes sweet. As many days l get in this life, they'll be spent with you... being happy and jolly like this, filled with sweet dreams - Hey where're the beats? - Beats? - Yes. - This is a sad song, meaning sorrowful. Stop it, boy. These days beats are needed even to cry. The heroines these days dance while crying. Don't you know? Well, listen to my scene. Suppose we film it from above, a big bang along with the camera. Will charge with a zoom. This sad crying won't do. This is the age of speed, boy. Age of speed, age of speed.

Wherever l go there's Bengalis. Where aren't there Bengalis, sir? Go to the jungles of Africa, the deserts of Arabia... to the mountains of Tibet, Bengalis are everywhere. - Come. - l too have change of ten rupees. l have it too.

No, no, why take my picture all of a sudden? - Kanai. - Get ready, sir. Get ready sir means? You must be thinking, sir, that we take bad pictures. We used to work in films. - Yes. - They don't pay for work we do, sir. When we go to ask for money we become monkeys or dogs. That's why we wondered why work for them. - So we left for good. - One minute, sir. Yes, make it fast, don't be slow. Here we have everything ready instantly. Come, come, you come. Come.

Well, if we hadn't met in the bus that day? Then this 'dear' wouldn't have been said. - Okay, let me drop you. - l beg of you, don't ever do that. - Why? - Because my mother's home. - Yes, yes. - My mother's feet are in this age... but her head is in the past. - And her daughter? - Her daughter? What's the need to read the end at first? - Greetings. - Come, come. Here, poet Shankar has left this song. Make a dance tune for it. Let me see. He'll dance. - Wow, wouldn't l dance along? - You'll dance? - Yes. - Good idea. Yes, she'll dance as well. - Yes. - Yes, get started. Brother, l don't have any dates after the day after tomorrow.

Come on, come on get started. - No corn but it's called... - Unicorn. No loon but it's called pantaloons. - Pantaloons, what's this? - Song. Song? lmpossible. A tune can't be made on these lines. You should know the public these days is fickle. They won't accept it unless there's a song like this. Who said they won't? They accept quality products all the time. You people are selling bad products and ruining their taste in music. Look, mister, we know only money. We didn't start in this business for charity. Don't you agree? You must agree. Otherwise we'll hire someone else. - Yes, do that. - ls this good? Throw away the first chance of your life? Yes. The first chance is important. But l may have some principles as well. Principles. Listen, kid, we also had principles. l've lasted for twenty-five years. What have l done yet? Six of my movies flopped. But l'm still standing here. But the one who doesn't have any principles... - Principles. Would you lick those principles for food? - Make an impression first. - lmpression? - Yes. - First make your mark Then dictate to us. - We'll accept with bowed heads. - Excuse me. Think over it again. - Where's the rehearsal room? - Over there, sir. - You wait here. l'll call brother. - Okay. - Think it over. - l have already. l can't do all these. Greetings. - What? - Now what? l'm thinking. - Hey Buddhu, you're here? - There's something very important. l'll introduce you to that girl. Can you get off? - l've got off forever, l gave up the job. - What? Why? lt's a long story. l'll tell you at home. Stop being crazy. First tell me about it. Come. - All crazy stuff. - Now, tell me what's the matter. What could be the matter? No corn but it's called a unicorn. Can a tune be made for this line? lmpossible. l left the job. Oh come on. You quit because of that? What's the value of honesty in this world? Wherever you look, you'll see only compromise. What have you done? - ldea, give me your clothes. - Clothes, why? Wearing your clothes l'll become Shankar... while you sit here quietly being Kumar. Well, does being an artist simply mean being sentimental? What? Yes, if it happens to be a real artist. l won't give up. You'll get what you want. That's like my boy. Good boy! No corn but it's called a unicorn. No loon but it's called pantaloons. No corn but it's called unicorn. No loon but it's called pantaloons Burns the skin, stunned moo, moo, right, right, right, right Put a pinch of snuff in the nose. Then drink a mug of yoghurt You'll get tickling sneezing, sneezing Put the shoes on both feet. Then go walking to Agra You'll find Jaamtola, Aamtola, Neemtola on the way No, no this isn't a joke. Have a stomach full of slapping Eat raw banana, ear twisting as much as you wish Tock, tock, tock, tock goes the horse cart How far is Baghdad Mecca from here? Burns the skin, stunned moo, moo, right, right, right, right No corn but it's called unicorn. No loon but it's called pantaloons Plumb Bishu Nandi makes plans day and night He talks big, big, huge, huge, large, large Strong short Bodka chews betel leaf with tobacco Only cartwheel, rowdiness, hooliganism goes on lf the girl of this house gets upset, the boy of that house smiles Burns the skin, stunned moo, moo, right, right, right, right No corn but it's called unicorn. No loon but it's called pantaloons l had to do all this even after being born in your country. Forgive me. What you did was unbelievable. - Come on. - You were so late? Brother is very busy. l'll introduce him to you later. Come. - Father. - l'm not able to see properly. Turn on the light. Yes. Come on, massage my hand. - Father. - What? - Why are you looking at the clock? - l want to go to the movies. - So go. - But mother? Oh yes. Your mother scolds you two a lot, doesn't she, dear? You go. l'll handle it. l'll say l had you run an errand. - Gita. Hey Gita. - Oh my, l'm finished! - Greetings, sir. - Greetings. - There's a letter for you. - Letter, from whom? - Mr. Shankar. - Oh ho. Go. Buddhu, l've got stuck with work, so l'm staying here. - l knew. - l'll be late returning. Don't worry about me. - l won't worry. Ticket, tonight's show? Must be Shankar's. - Mr. Pants, tea for you. - Yes, yes, give me. - Mr. Dhoti isn't at home? - No. Look, he has this movie ticket and got stuck at work today. - Then you go in his place, Mr. Pants. - Me? No, no, l don't like sad films. The money will be wasted. You shoud go. - lt's a very nice English movie. - English movie? Then it's useless, sir. lf it was Hunterwali l'd go for sure. - Now, you should go. - Okay then, l'll go. Take this. - Looking very nice. - Give me. Look, look. Take this. Look, that's the girl. Come with me. Nowadays, it's difficult to know by the face... - who's decent and who... - lndeed. - Don't you recognize me? - lf l ever see you again... doing all this, l'll call the police, understand? - Bengali? - Yes. l'm Bengali as well. Here l am Kishan Chandra. Actually, l'm Shri Keshto Chandra. - So what should l do about that? - No, no nothing, nothing. But you know what? lt's better to keep private matters confined to the home. The police are as same as tigers. - How surprising. - Nothing is surprising about women. No, no, l can't bear all those tantrums. - Ah, what a problem. - Big problem. These days, there are female police as well. lf l ever see you again, then l'll call the police, understand? He avenged me. What, l've been waiting for you for so long. Come to eat. - You go, l won't eat. - What's happened? - A man shouldn't be trusted. - What's the matter, sister? Nothing, you go to eat. All the things are so messed up here. Hey you. Where are you going early morning? - What are you asking, mother? - Where are you going? - To the office. - To office? To office at eight in the morning? There's new work at the office that must be completed. So you've done a favor for us. So where will you eat? - Eat? Over there. Over there. - Over there? - Yes. - Very well. Then take your bed and luggage to stay there. - Mother, l mean... - No need to mean anything. Go wherever you're going. Return early. - l thought you wouldn't come. - How could l come earlier? Already everyone asked why l was leaving for work so early. - But today we aren't going to the office. - l know that. - But that can't be said at home. - What did you say at home? What else should l say? l had to lie so much because of you. - l said, there's a lot of work at the office. - Very good. - Have some puffed rice. - Well, where should we go now? - Wherever our feet take us. - lt'll be fun. Today we'll move around the whole day. Come on. - Give me my picture. - No, no, you won't get this. This is mine. This is yours. Only the picture is yours, or the actual person as well? - Both. - What are you looking at so anxiously? - lt'll be over in a couple of days. - No. Just wanting a little and getting a little Let my song become sweet for that excitement As the river comes, to meet the blue sea As the land meets the sky at the horizon Being near to you becomes sweet like that tune Just wanting a little and getting a little Let my song become sweet for that excitement l don't know to where we floated... or how far we both want to get lost How far can we go before this golden rope reaches its end? Just wanting a little Let the time float away in this dream land The south wind will write the lyrics to a new song Being near to you becomes sweet like that Just wanting a little and getting a little Let my song become sweet for that excitement l say, what's happened in this modern era? Now girls are coming home late, too, like the boys, eh? l ask, where were you so late at night? Where were you? - Office. - The office? l ask, does the office go on till evening these days? ls this what is called coming home early? Mother, l mean, a lot of work has come. That's why. To hell with such work. As if there's no food at home and that's why you got a job. l'm telling you, you must return by three beginning tomorrow... whether you have office or not. Oh ho, ho, my, my. l'm dying of joint pain. Oh my, my, these girls are making my life a living hell. Shall l commit suicide or what? Fine, wonderful. lt must be noted down. Wonderful? As is the father, so are the daughters. - What happened? - What happened? The girl came back home now, so late, so l asked where she was. - She said the office. - Office at night? That's what l came to tell you. You don't care about anything. What should l do, tell me. Should l go and shut down the office? Who's asking you to close the office? l've been telling you to get the girl married. - Else she'll get spoiled like Gita. - Okay, that will be done. - lt'll be done? - Yes. Are the grooms some fruit, hanging on trees all around? What's wrong? Mother's shouting so much. Mother gets angry over anything. Why did she raise us this way? You know how mother is, Rita. Stay quiet. What could you do? Look, could you draw a picture from this photo? - Yes, why not? - But have to return this tomorrow. - Whose photo is it? - That same, very foolish, very clever man. Let me see, let me see. - Hey, do you have a cigarette? - ln the coat pocket. - Buddhu. - Yes? Who is it you've put in your pocket? - What did you say? - l mean where have you placed the one in your pocket? So you saw it. ln the temple of my heart. - Very nice. - lt's very obvious. She doesn't veil her face. - That day there was a girl at the cinema. - A girl? - Not just a girl, a dangerous girl. - What are you saying? Yes. She said l was looking very nice, and leaned over me. - l guarded my pocket. - All the girls find only you. You did this? You both are dear to me. l'll move out of your way. l'll move away. Those days gone by call me back As if love paints a picture with the painful colors of my heart l recall, l recall l recall that memory of our first meeting l recall that time of exchanging hearts Two different paths of two different people... united and became a new path The days were so musical in a new land That tune cries, in my life. lt's broken, alas it's broken ln the fair of sweet meeting... today that game of laughter and colors has come to end The sky never remembers when each star... broke and scattered down Those days gone by call me back As if love paints a picture with the painful colors of my heart - Hey. - Yes? - Did you paint all night long? - Yes. - Wow, it's wonderful! ls it finished? - A little bit more. l placed an advertisement in the newspaper for... a suitable groom for your daughter, understand? l understand perfectly. Have you lost your mind or what? - Why? - lf it's a house wanted, situation wanted, then it's okay. But how can a groom be found from an ad in the paper? Ah, you don't understand. l'm a professor. l teach the boys, not kidnap them. Humph, l know how valuable you are. Listen, listen, listen. How about writing a letter to Ramesh? l've heard his son is well educated, and has a good job as well. - Who's Ramesh? - The one who was supposed to come and stay with us. Maybe write to him? lf it should be written, why aren't you writing? - All right, then l'll write a letter to him. - Humph. Oh my. That's all. Your dear friend Jagadish. Sister! Sister! Here's a marriage proposal for your beloved nephew. For Buddhu? From where? My friend Jagadish. Jagadish wants to marry his daughter to our Buddhu. Then don't delay. Get the marriage arranged before l die. - Well, how does the girl look? - l saw her once in childhood. Well, she must be good looking. Our Jagadish is a good looking man. But l don't understand which of his daughters he's written for. One of them draws pictures. The other one passed her BA. Oh my. Then l'll have to learn English at this old age. - So what's your opinion? - What's the need of my opinion on this? Ask him to send a picture of the girl. We need Buddhu's opinion. - After all, he's a modern boy. - What's the value of his opinion? What does he know about marriage? He's never been married. At least we've married once. - So then l'll write that to Jagadish. - Yes, yes. lf you keep doing like this, it won't do. Where's the bed sheet? How would l know where the bed sheet is? First, you come after one whole month. Moreover, if you keep losing things all the time, how will that do? - No, no. - 'No, no' my foot. lf you do so l'll deduct money. - No don't, please. - No need for 'No don't, please'. Get lost. Dear. Dear? l've arranged. l've arranged your marriage. My marriage? Have you gone mad? You've lost your mind in your old age. lf you wish, you get married. Shame, shame, shame, shame. Not yours, your daughter's marriage has been arranged. - So tell me what he wrote. - Well Ramesh... has written he has no objection. So, will you marry both to the same man? - Meaning? - Meaning will you get both married to the same boy? What about Gita? Will be, will be done one after the other, - One by one, my dear. - Disgusting. Oh God, now let Gita get settled as well. l'm in the same situation. Father has written a letter. He wants to get me married to the daughter of his friend. l don't know her. How can l marry her? l don't know, either. But how to stop the marriage? - Now l must think. - l'm also thinking. - What to do? - Let's see what happens. l've sent a letter to father saying l won't marry. - But, l can't send a letter to mother. - What? - What is to happen will happen. - Yes, there's no point in thinking. A little glimpse at a blink. lf it happens a little more... what's the harm? With the dreams... - What? Who is it? - Telegram. Telegram? Sign here. 'Aunt seriously ill, come sharp.' Aunt seriously ill. Shankar, aunt is, very seriously ill. - Father, how is aunt? - Hey Buddhu, when did you come? - How are you, son? - What is this, aunt? You were ill? Would you have come if l hadn't written l was sick? - But the telegram? - You stopped writing after the marriage talk... so we had to send a telegram. Your marriage is finalized, Buddhu. What are you thinking so much? You have a job, the girl is cultured and attractive. Get married before l die, son. - lf you insist, what can l say? - Live long, son, live long. Buddhu. Hey Buddhu. Buddhu, come to eat, son. Hey Buddhu. Buddhu, whom are you thinking about, dear? Buddhu, are you asleep, son? Hey Buddhu. - My whole body is in pain. - What are you saying? - l'm dying. - No, no, my boy, no, my boy. With marriage in the cards, now you fall ill? - Whose marriage? - Don't say that. Rauma. Hey Rauma. Well, l'll go and tell. Hey Rauma, do you hear? Rauma. - Shankar. Shankar. - Shankar will come, son. Bhola, check properly, brother. My poor fellow has gone pale overnight. No, no he doesn't have a fever. Kumar, let me check your belly. What are you doing? what are you doing? - Let me check, let me check. - Uuuh. - Come on, lift the leg. - Uuuh. Uh, uh. The head aches, the stomach aches, the legs ache. l can't diagnose it for a day or two. - Ramesh, it's either appendicitis or else gallstones. - Gladstone. There are roads and parks named after important people. Are there diseases as well? Yes, but not Gladstone. lt's gallstone, understand? That's the younger brother. Shankar. No fever, but Delirium. What a disaster! Ramesh, write Shankar to come immediately. How could you manage all alone? What's the need to call Shankar for all this? Very much needed. Don't you see he's shouting Shankar repeatedly? Moreover, fights should be forgotten during troubled times. lt's needed to call Shankar. - That's okay but his address... - Number 13, Churchgate Cadell road, Shankar. How did you learn his address? Very fishy. No fever but Delirium, but completely in his senses. Ramesh, you come with me. l'll write the prescription. Bhola, give him good medicine, brother. Going to your house is restricted. But you shouldn't go there, either. l thought to go there again tomorrow. But just now l received a telegram from home. lt's urgent. l'm leaving right away. On receiving this letter come to that place. l have much to tell you. lt feels now we'll both get what we've desired. The boy is handsome, well educated, and has a good job. Now, you don't throw any tantrums, dear. Yes, resign from your job this very day. - What, is it that same Buddhu? - Buddhu, Buddhu, Buddhu. l know very well what kind of boy he'll be, one whose name is Buddhu. l'll marry that boy, my foot. Husband, Buddhu. Come on, Buddhu. - l won't. - Drink it. Good boy, drink it. - lt tastes horrible. - How will you be cured? Drink it. Good boy. - Oh my God, you spat it out. - Give me water, give me water. Oh my, there's no water. Wait, wait. l'll bring water. Give me water. Water, water. Doctor Bhola, doctor Bhola... Hey Rauma, where are you all? Bring water. You're all useless. Do l have to say everything? A patient should always have water. Don't you even know that much? Coca Cola, Coca cCola. Yes, yes, l'm bringing water right away. All useless. ls there any meaning to this nonsense. lt's getting late, give me. Go. - Bring quickly. - Here l come, son. Give me water, give me water, give me water. - Take. - Give me the medicine. Give the medicine. - Take. - Give. Hey, hey what are you doing? You'll choke! Don't drink so much at once. Don't drink, Buddhu! Don't drink so much at one go. l'll be cured immediately. My God, l'm unable to manage this boy. Look what he's doing. Come on, sleep now. Oh my. Are you okay? Did something go wrong? - l'm very fine. - Now sleep. My goodness. Okay, you relax, l have a lot of work pending, okay? Will you be fine? l'm going, okay? - Look how crazy this boy is. He drank all the medicine. - Aunt. Hey Shankar, after so many days, son, you remembered. - Look what has happened to Buddhu. - How are you, Buddhu? l'm dying. l'm dying. You left home over a marriage, and he fell ill. Okay, you be seated. l'll finish my bath and return. - l have to tell you many things. l'll do it later, okay? - Okay. l'll leave. You be seated. - Close the door. - Why? Close it, l say. - Give me a cigarette. - l thought you were sick? Oh l'll tell you later. Do you have a cigarette? - Give me. - You'll smoke cigarettes when you're sick? l'll tell you. l'll tell you everything. - Do you have matches? - So the addiction is still there? - Yes, yes it is, it is. - Oh my goodness. Ah, now l feel relieved, dear, dear. Listen, listen, no illness no nothing. Father has fixed my marriage. l want to stop that marriage. Oh, so that's why you're ill? Now don't delay. Don't you know my case? l know it very well. lt's a very difficult case. A lot of work will be needed. Do what ever you have to do. The summary is, just save me, please. l'll have to manage. Let me see what father is doing. Don't say anything to Shankar now. Okay, l wont, but l'm saying no marrying any artists. Aha, l'm saying don't get excited. l'll convince him later. - Father? - l'll finish my work and return. Come, come, come. Son, you both made me anxious. You're obssessed with an artist girl... and won't give up unless you marry her. And the other one didn't agree at first... even if he agreed after so much persuasion. Now he's fallen ill. Tell me, what's the reason for refusing the marriage? He has a a job, has a house. The girl is no less, and is also educated. Here, look at her photo. Now tell me, what is there to reject? But yes, if you're so stubborn you won't marry your parents' choice... then that's different. Don't worry about it. l'll make him agree. You arrange the marriage. - What did father say? - He showed me the picture of your future wife. - Future wife? - See the picture once. You might like it. - But l didn't like her. - Forget all that nonsense. Tell me what you did for which l sent you? l tried hard to convince him... but father is determined to have you marry that ugly girl. So you convinced him very well. Do something. Bring me a rope so l can hang myself. You're good for nothing. Then let me do one thing. l'll tell father to take you to a good doctor in Bombay. Then you'll recover quickly. Brilliant. Just tell me how to stop the marriage. How? Why are you getting angry? Listen, you flee from there on the marriage day. You saved me, you saved me. l can't tolerate that doctor doing anymore. You can't, so shall l say that to father? Yes, yes, say that. But whatever you say, do it fast. l can't bear any more, brother, not any more. l can't, l can't, l can't. Tell mother, l will never marry that fellow. Think over it properly. Rita, does the one you love really love you? - Yes, yes he really loves me. - Really loves you? How do you know he really loves you? As everyone comes to know, as you came to know one day. l see. l'll tell mother, but l don't think mother will agree. l won't do this marriage under any condition. No matter what it takes, you'll have to make her agree. - But if l can't? - lf you can't? - lf you can't, then you'll lose me forever. - Rita. - Buddhu? Hey Buddhu? - Yes? - Put this on. - What, what are you doing? Wear it, son, or you'll catch cold, wear it. Can anyone go out wearing a monkey cap? Of course. Your father went out wearing this cap his whole life. - Now come. - What a problem. Come, son come. So then, father, l would take Buddhu along. There's no reason to worry. l'll bring him for the marriage. We'd better not say anything about marriage to him now. No, no, am l crazy? These days boys change their minds every minute. Bring him on the day of marriage. Then it's decided. Come, son, come. Shankar, take care of Buddhu. Son, he shouldn't catch cold. Okay. - Okay then, we'll leave. - Be safe, be safe. - Listen, listen. - What? Check the list for Rita's marriage. What shall l check? l don't understand all this. No, you won't understand. The neighbors will understand. We need to rent a school building. This house won't be enough. So do it. Why ask me? - l'll be late for college. Don't you understand? - Humph. Just college, college, college. - Mother. - What? l say, don't force Rita to get married like this. To ask her or to force her, leave that to me. l mean, she hasn't agreed. lsn't agreed that's why? The marriage is arrainged already. And now she says it isn't? lf she does something drastic, then? You people are capable of that, l don't doubt it. So does your sister think that some prince will come... to marry a crippled fairy like her? All nonsense requests. Oh my, my, l forgot to give the picture. These days l'm really making too many mistakes. - Hey Gita. Gita. - What? Dear, l've made a big mistake. This is Rita's husband. Give it to your mother. Hold it, l'm getting late. You don't worry. l'll make Rita agree. But don't say anything to her yet. Fine, as you wish. Oh my, l'm dying of joint pain, dear. Gita, what did mother say? Don't worry at all. Everything will be all right. - The marriage stopped? - Yes. Sister, my dear sister. - Hello? - Wrong number. - Greetings. How are you? - What happened? A mistake happened. - Mr. Keshav. - Yes? - Where's Kamala Devi? - Kamala Devi? - Hey Tarun. - Yes brother? Listen. Kamala Devi was once his colleague. Now she's become his wife. Why are you feeling shy, man? Do you need something? No l just haven't seen her. Oh. So what's the news about Rita Devi? Rita Devi, where is she? - Oh, so it's not you. - Meaning? - Did you get a letter? - Letter? - Yes, letter, a yellow letter? - No l didn't. Rita Devi is going to become someone's wife. You didn't get the letter? We didn't either, sir. We didn't. - Hey, Gopi. What's the time, son? - lt's eight o'clock. Look at this. They haven't come yet. - Where's the priest? - He's inside. - So, what is Rita doing? - She's crying. Humph, all drama. After a couple of days... she won't be able to live without this same husband. Where are you going? Check out the things, dear. Or l'll wonder how everything will be managed. And tell your father to make the guests comfortable. Yes, call me during the rituals. Uh, l'll die of this pain. What is this? Raise your face, or the make up will run. What, are you angry? How long will you stay angry at me? - What, won't you talk to me? - Why did you do this to me? Don't worry. Everything will be all right. You go away from here. Leave me alone. You go. Buddhu, what are you thinking of so much? l am thinking how easily people forget. Who's forgotten? The one whom l placed in my heart. - Did she go to someone else's heart? - That's what l heard. - Girls shouldn't be trusted. - Everyone has the same question. There's no point in thinking about it. Come, let's go out a little. - Come, come. - Where to go? There's a function l have to attend. Come. Take this. Well, brother Keshav, have you fallen for someone. l mean... What, didn't l tell you? l fell, but not properly That's why l'm like a crazy man now. Stop ahead. Hey, hey look, brother Keshav. Brother Keshav. - What? - There, mister Kumar. - Kumar? - Come, come, come. Come, let's see. What is this? lt seems to be a marriage house. You said a function. l guess the matter is... No, no nothing like that. The functions here happen to be like this. Don't be nervous. Come. Everything is adulterated. Nothing is original. Hey Shankar, you people have come. Well, well, well, well. But Buddhu is wearing a suit. Are we Englishmen? Oh that's a mistake. He'll change right away. Hurry up! Shankar, you trapped me even after being my brother. Shame! The barber has come but the groom is missing. Hey Ramesh, where is your son? Here he is, directly from the office. Oh ho, ho, that's why the jacket and pants. How times have changed, Ramesh. Boys don't even have time to get married. Doesn't matter, doesn't matter. Now l'll give him the wedding clothes. But, son your face looks very dull?

Come on, hurry up. - Look, look, it's a very big mistake. - Mistake? - Yes. - l never make mistakes, son. - This is the actual groom. - ls it? Then what's this? - They both look the same. Are they... - Twins, of course. Oh ho, ho, ho, ho. Son, l made a small mistake. Here, put this on. l haven't seen such a marriage, ever in my life, dear. lf there's a good man, then move away. Otherwise she'll eat up the brains. Now let them have the first look. Look at each other. You? - Do they know each other? - Yes, something's fishy. Am l dreaming or what? - Get out, get away. - What are you saying, to whom? To whom? To you, skilled boy. - Mother, what are you doing? - The drama of love, my dear. - Aha ha ha. - Don't say anything to him. Oh my, who is this? Whatever it is, say it to me. Oh my, what is this? Oh Rauma's mother, hold me. Oh my, what is this? What's all this? A ghost or what? Rauma's mother, call my husband. Send him here immediately. But still one more is left, understand, Chatterjee? - Ghost, ghost. - What ghost? - Yes, aunt. - Aunt ghost. What happened, dear, what happened? - What's the matter? - Look there. - What did Shankar do? - He didn't do anything. - They're twins. - Twins? - So you were also deceived, dear. - You be quiet. - That boy wanted to marry Gita. - Oh. Ramesh... this son of yours wanted to marry my other daughter. But my wife refused because he works in cinema. That's why l, too, wasn't on good terms with him. But, you said you want to marry some artist girl? - No l mean... - My daughter is an artist. She paints very well, and has won first prize in exhibitions. Oh l see. That means she's not an actress? How could my daughter be an actress? Oh my. Then why didn't you tell me before now? You're a first class fool. Because of this foolishness l knocked you out of my property. Won't he get the property now? Of course, why not? After all, l'm his father. That means he'll get the property. Listen, get Gita married to this boy. He knows a little bit of music. That's good. So, Ramesh, what's your opinion? That's fine. The sooner the better. Mother, then let the marriage take place on this auspicious occasion. Rightly said, son rightly said. Did you see, dear, how l got both daughters married off? Yes got them married instantly, one after the other. Did you do that, or did it happen because of my scolding? - Oh, yes, yes. - Hey you all, start the celebration. - Yes, yes. - Gita. - You? You're here? - ls the marriage over? - l was married a long time ago. - Why did you come here. Go, go away. - lf l don't go? l beg of you, go from here. Don't just stand there. Go. - What will people say if they see? - Let them say, what's the harm? You might not be harmed, but what about Rita? Here you are. l see everyone's involved. You wicked girl. Why didn't you tell me earlier? - Come on, give your hand. - What's this? No, no, no, no, nothing can happen now. Nothing can happen now. Why not, lady, why not? Better late than never. How do you do, pickpocket? What is this? You both... Shame, shame, how embarrassing. - Don't be nervous. - You're a real fool. As you say. Well, so retired lover, extension. But if the misunderstanding happens again? - Then it will be a problem. - Then let's exchange positions.
