This is Jonathan Caouette again. I'm, uh, just calling to get the status on my mother, Renee LeBlanc. Is she still not talking? And they started the dialysis? And do you know... like, what the repercussions are of this? 'Cause I went on the internet earlier and it doesn't look too hot. Yeah. [coughing] Yeah, we could leave-- I could run a key over to you before I have to go to the train station. I feel like I'm gonna have an anxiety attack. [retching] Yeah, I'm really-- I'm sick on top of it, too. I've got, like, a 102 fever. I guess from all the stress. -[Renee] Go placidly amidst the noise and hate and remember what peace there may be in solace. As far as possible without surrender, be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly. Listen to others. Even the dull and ignorant too have their story to tell. Avoid [inaudible] and aggressive persons. They are vexations to the spirit.

Um... my testimony is about, um, me and my little baby... Caroline. I've b-- I've been through hell. I'm kind of nervous here in front of you all. What a year, you know? 1969. Just...[inaudible] housewife for me. Um, it all s-- started when, um... Jim-- Jimmy was coming home late at night. He was getting-- you know, getting into, um, alcohol. And I-- I was...pregnant with Caroline and... still gaining the pounds. She's only-- she's two years old now. Healthy baby. Um... s-- she-- he used to beat me... when he'd come home drunk at night. [starting to cry] He used to beat me. And... he used to, um... he...kicked me in the stomach while I was pregnant. And, um... he'd tie me up... when he was smoking that dope. That's what got to him...in the brain there. And, um... [cries] [inaudible]. This is really, um... hard for me. One night, he got out the gun. I was tied up on the bed. And he came and pointed it to my head. He said, "I'll kill you, bitch. I'll kill you!" It was the other way around. I-- I... I got out the gun one night.

Nicotine and the heat from the cigarettes still get on their lip no matter what side you put it on. Isn't that right, Jon? You make a testimony. And I'll tell you that's the honest truth. -Hi, [inaudible]. My name is Sharelle. Have you ever just sat down? You like my hair? It's done. It's done. My secret is egg. And my name is Sharelle.

I am emotionally disturbed right now, even though I wasn't brought up in a very neat and perfect environment. [inaudible] freaked me out. [laughs] I had a [inaudible] in another dimension and then I switched. See, um, I got a little of a drug. I'm not exactly sure what kind, but I believe it was either PCP or LSD, and it depersonalized my mind. Nobody else hears it, but I do. And I've been-- I've-- I've been to Maryland [inaudible]. I hope they don't die. I am depersonalized and I think it is from the brain damage. I feel like I'm in a dream all the time. I forgot how it was to be normal, you know? Sometimes, it freaks me out. And I think I'll-- I think that was the time I was talking about her and her pussy and all that stuff. I was making-- I don't usually talk dirty like that. [yawns] Oh, well. Life is a trip. It's like one big long dream. No, no gay person came up to me and brainwashed me. If anybody is listening, I am gay. I've always been gay. I don't know if it's from the molesting or not. I'm just lusty for everything. I don't-- I don't even like to suck on stuff like that. I just have the feelings of doing it. I don't like to do it. Seriously, I don't. I love my mother so much.

She kidnapped me, took me to Chicago, Illinois. She was raped in front of me. They were talking about these tunnels... these tunnels that were underground. These skeletons that were discovered. Nobody's supposed to know I'm gay. But I sort of wanted it in a way, because I do have gay feelings. But I don't know why. I guess I'm a silent faggot. Look at me. [whispering] [inaudible]. Do you think I'm crazy? I'm not crazy, I'm just stupid. [inaudible] I'm cracking up, I'm hearing things. There was a very big, fucked up mistake. There goes that noise. What the hell is it?

Now, let it down! Let it down, Jonathan! I told you to always open it by that stick! -[Jonathan] Hello? Talk into the video camera. Hang on.

You're making a sinner out of me! -Somewhere, my flower's up there! [inaudible]. -How do you get it with the face looking into the... The camera lens or somewhere else? -[Jonathan] Yeah, into the camera lens. -I would like to display my earrings, which are-- I bought them at Elizabeth Taylor's boutique in California. Yes, that's in San Francisco. And she also has this boutique in Houston. These are what she wore in her White Diamonds commercial. And, um... I've-- I've become, uh, overwhelmed by these earrings because they are white diamonds. And they are an authentic possession of-- that Elizabeth Taylor once wore. I gotta run over to my apartment in LA and pick up some items... and bring them to my son, who is in Houston. [laughing] It makes no sense, but that's all I could think of. Hey, momma's gotta go now. -[Jonathan] I have a crush on this guy in theater arts that looks just like Nick Drake. He lives out in the woods and he's a great musician. He carves [inaudible] and ZZ Top on his legs. -[Jonathan] [inaudible]. [laughing] Tell me where you are. -[Jonathan and Michael] I am Pazoozoo! [laughs] -That bitch. [pretends to cry] That bitch. [inaudible]. Fuck off, bitch! Fuck-- fuck the fuckers! Fuck you, bitch! -♪Sometimes, the wind blows♪ -Uh, what these kids are doing is, uh, using Marianne Faithful as, uh, in regard to her relationship with, uh, Mick Jagger as sort of a quasi-metaphor for the Dorothy Valance character. -You either rock out really crazily and get down-- -[woman] Yeah. -Or you could go very demure while everyone's rocking out behind you and just be like... you know, move your fingers, maybe hips, and bopping a little shoulder here or there. -[doll] I dig that crazy beat. Yeah. -[laughs] [inaudible]. -[doll] Like, you're way out. -[laughs] -[Jonathan] She's a beatnik. -[doll] Hey, sweetie!

There's nobody on the line. There's nobody on the line, but this is brand new. [laughs] -Hello. -Here I am in beautiful, sunny-- -[woman] Say something. Say "Hello, how are you?" How old are you, Jonathan? -20. -[woman] When will you be 21, soon? -Two months. -[woman] Two months? How old are you, David? -[laughing] 13. -[woman] When will you be 14? -In December. -[woman] Is that three months away? -I guess. -This is September 1993. -Yeah, three months. -And I'm still smoking. My own private Idaho. -[Renee] You wouldn't have a family if I die, Jon. You'll have no one. -[Jonathan] That's not true. -It is true. I'm all you've ever had. You never... you never really appreciated me for what I was. -Everybody has this mark right here. But before a person is born, God shows them everything. He shows them heaven and everything. But when they're getting ready to be born, God doesn't want them to remember any of that. So an angel touches-- touches... it touched me, it touches everybody before they're born. And everybody has this little mark. He says that's what it is. It's that angel touches your child before they're born so they won't remember. Yeah, Rosemary ha-- had a stroke, oh, uh, quite a few months ago. And, uh, we, uh, have a lot of hope and confidence that, uh, she will proceed in being well again. Diet very carefully. We think that's one of the keys to it. We're giving her low sodium and we give her a lot of fresh vegetables. Well, we're saying about another 30 to 60 days that she will... start and gradually get better and better. -[Jonathan] Do your Bette Davis imitation, Grandma. See how pretty? Pretty Grandma. Grandma, say hello, start talking. Look into the camera. -[Renee] She's really, really tired. -[Jonathan] Look right into the camera and start talking. -What do you want me to say? -[Jonathan] Just talk about stuff. -I don't feel like it. -[Jonathan] Take the wig off. Pull it off, Grandma. You can just pull it off. You don't have to do it from the top. -[Renee] Take it off. -[Jonathan] From the side. -Maybe [inaudible], one of the war songs that's stuck with me, "Coming In On a Wing and a Prayer," and they have a meaning to them, too. Every one of them. [inaudible] something to me that gives me hope. -We were all sleeping and they just woke us up and banged on our doors a couple of times and asked us to evacuate. -I want you to know that I-- I-- I really believe in you. And you have such good thoughts, such good deeds that you've done... that you've really impressed me and make me a happy guy. -I'm gonna help myself to some coffee. -[David] Sure, go ahead, please. -Really? What's your name? -David. You do not pay attention! You're not listening. -[inaudible]. Shiny? -[laughs] -♪Don't you forget the nest where you used to rest♪ ♪It wasn't the worst but among the best♪ -Would you like another donut? -Mm, it's good. Especially when we cause a riot, you know? Oh, my goodness! This is wonderful. -We're gonna blow up now. Happy new year! -[David] Happy new year, baby! -Happy new year! ...doing, David? -Angel. -[Jonathan] Now stand up. Let's see what it looks like. Wow. -[David] Wow. -[Jonathan] Looks like a-- a nuclear angel. Where are we? -Home. -[Jonathan] Where is home? -Where? -[Jonathan] Where do we live? -Greenpoint. -[Jonathan] It's our New York apartment! See how big it is? -They say in one of my books that Elizabeth Taylor was hamming it up for the camera at age three, so I inherited that. I was an extremely abused child. It was a-- an ongoing thing. There was no end to it. I never knew from one minute to the next when I was gonna be hit or slapped or drug by my hair... by my-- the people who raised me. Sick parents raise sick children. My children are Jonathan and David, and they are very special, wonderful children. When I was a little girl, the mother who raised me... would chase me through the house with a belt in her hand, and I would run to my bed and lie on my stomach, and she would whip me on my back. Rosemary was the woman who raised me. She was... schizophrenic, she was very neurotic, and she was very psychotic. She would hit me on my back, she would... hit me with her fist for no apparent reason. I was extremely abused and, uh... hopefully, I-- I didn't bring over any of the abuse to my children. I wanted to be the one to break the cycle. -[Jonathan] Tell me about the accident. What happened? -Nothing. I feel out the window. -[Jonathan] What was the accident? -I fell out.... -[Jonathan] What was your first memory of the first mental hospital that you went to. -Uh-uh-- -[Jonathan] Tell me! -This is way too much. -[Jonathan] No, tell me, tell me! Because it's not your fault, Renee. -No, it's not. -[Jonathan] It's not your fault! -No, it's not! -[Jonathan] You have nothing to run away from! -[Renee] I'm-- I'm sick, okay? -[Jonathan] You're not sick! -[Renee] Oh, yes, I am, now. -[Jonathan] Will you just please help me with my stupid film? -[Renee] My stomach can't take this. -[Jonathan] Talk to me! Mommy, this is the kind of shit that you talk to me about all day. You bring this up and you recycle these stories to me all the time about Rosemary and Adolph and your doctors and how fucked up they fucked you up. -Your father i-- of course is Steve, and he was a very good provider for us when he was married, when I was married to him. And, um, had a beautiful apartment home, had the finest furniture and the best food. And he was a good, loyal friend and husband to me for the length of time that we were married. Um... -[Jonathan] How did you guys meet? -[sighs] Oh, my God. I've got enough problems, honey, without bringing up the past, okay?! My therapist told me I don't have to bring up the past! -You know, I'd like to find out a few things about myself, too. -[Renee] We can talk, Jon. We don't need it on film. -[Renee] Hello, Jonathan. Adolph's going to have me committed. I can't take it anymore. Adolph screams and yells at me every day. I can't stand this. Hello, honey? Listen, please call your mom tonight. It's-- it's definitely an emergency. Jonathan, please call me! I think Adolph's gonna put me in the hospital to make it look like I'm the one that needs the help. They'll come to my door and put handcuffs on me and put me inside of a car and carry me to God-knows-where. Let me tell you, Jonathan, there should be a law against this. This is a call of desperation. I take Lithium like a good girl, but there's nothing wrong with me. Let me tell you, Jonathan, I'm getting out of Texas, and I'm... I'm coming to live with you. -[man] David or Jonathan, please call Renee. David or Jonathan, please call Renee. David or Jonathan, please call Renee... -All great. Everything's great. -Walking around. -I know. -It's crazy. -[inaudible]. Great, great, I-- and now, I know may never recover. My apartment became very dirty. -[Jonathan] Oh, I saw. [laughter] -And I fell out. [laughs] -[Jonathan] How are you feeling? -Fine. -[Jonathan] Good. You look beautiful. -One, two, three, four, five, six, seven and-- -Can't complain, everything is fine. -[Jonathan] Yeah? -[singing indistinctly] Okay. Mamma. Mamma! Mamma, don't do it to me. [singing indistinctly] Fixed and fast. Mommy loves you all the best. Film Michael. -Don't touch it. Don't drop it. -[Renee] Okay, I'm not doing nothing. Stay back. -You're shaking it, you're shaking it. -[Renee] No, no. -Okay, don't-- you have to-- you're shaking it. You're gonna drop my camera. -[inaudible]. [laughs] [inaudible]. [laughs] It ain't my fault. I talk funny 'cause, you know, [inaudible]. [laughs] [laughing] Okay. Oh, Lordy. It's a pumpkin. [inaudible] pumpkin. [inaudible] pumpkin, baby. [laughs] I swear to God, this is a pumpkin. Woohoo! [laughs] Smile, you're on candid camera today! [laughs] Ooh, smashing pumpkins. [laughs] I'm snowing. [inaudible] snowing. And it's...really stormy weather. [inaudible]. [laughs] This is little pumpkin, short and stout. Tip me over and pour me out. I'm the little pumpkin, short and stout. Tip me over and pour me out. It's a pumpkin. Do the pumpkin. [laughs] Do the pumpkin [inaudible]. [laughs] [inaudible]. [laughs] [inaudible] pumpkins. [laughs] [inaudible]. [laughs] [inaudible]. Do the pumpkin. [laughs] I know! [inaudible]. [laughs] [inaudible]. [laughs] I can get onstage and entertain. Do the pumpkin. [laughs] Do the pumpkin. [laughs] [inaudible]. Do the doll's head. [laughs] She's cute. Do the doll's head. [laughs] [inaudible]. Do the pumpkin. [laughs] It's mine. This is all I have for dinner [inaudible]. [laughs] That's why I'm so...interested in pumpkins. [laughs] Let's go upstairs [inaudible]. [inaudible]. -[Jonathan] What prompted you and Grandma to start administering shock treatments to her over and over again? What-- who talked you into that? -It was the doctors. -[Jonathan] Didn't you think that electricity on the brain at that time could have been harmful? -No. -[Jonathan] I'm wondering if Mommy would have never had the shock treatments, if she would have been normal, if she would have not had to deal with anything like this. -Well, she-- she-- -[Jonathan] Any illnesses. -She's normal, she gets depressed once in a while. -[Jonathan] She gets delusional. She tells me that you and Grandma used to lock her in closets. -No. -[Jonathan] That you would just lock her in closets and abuse her and... she's even told me things like... horrible things, Dad. Like your mother used to molest her and touch her on her vagina. And she thinks that you're not her real parents. -Sometimes, she thinks Elizabeth Taylor was her mother. -[Jonathan] That Elizabeth Taylor was? Do you know what she also told me? That she was born with four nipples. And that she was also born a hermaphrodite. A boy. She either is delusional and she completely believes what she's saying or there's maybe some truth to this. -We've got a happy family and a wonderful family and we love God. I know things a little more deeper than-- than you do. -Dad, the world is a hateful place. -No... -Yes, it is, Dad. -[Jonathan] Do you think this family has been a government experiment? -Yes, it has been. -I-- I-- I don't know what-- -[inaudible] your fucking memory is shot to hell! -[laughs] Now, honey-- -You can't remember shit in your own life-- -You're too pretty to talk like that. [laughs] -Fuck you! -[Jonathan] Dad, did you ever lock Renee up in closets? -No. -Jonathan, don't bring that up, damn you! -No, I-- -Adolph, don't bring that up. Jonathan, damn you. Stop it! -I'm out of it. Just-- I-- I-- -[Jonathan] Why are you so angry with me? -The questions you ask me and all of that, there's nothing the matter with-- with me. You're trying to-- you're trying to scheme something on me. -[Jonathan] I'm not trying to scheme anything on you! -Just leave me alone and you tend to your business! You understand? -[Jonathan] I'm not trying to scheme anything on you. -Well, just leave me alone! Police department, please. I'm on the phone. -Adolph, are you insane? -No, I want to call-- -Yes, you are! -I want to talk to [inaudible]. You can come over to my house. [inaudible] here is acting up and I want you to.... Take that away! Take that away! -[Renee] He's photographing-- -No, I don't want to be photographed by him! -More like yourself. -Can you see? -Yeah. -[Renee] Can I get my New York ID tomorrow? -Yeah, what time do you need to get there? -[Renee] [inaudible]. -Okay. You've gotta wake me up in the morning because I'm off my sleeping schedule right now. -[laughs] -What? -[inaudible]. -Oh, I know. [laughs] [laughs] -Filming on the toilet? -It's like five in the morning and I wanted this scene to kind of be in the dark like it was when I was younger with the light and... the sun's about to come up, so I have to hurry up and do this. My mother's up right now. She's-- she has insomnia. She's-- she's off her sleeping schedule. She's downstairs right now. She's just... turning the sink on, so I'm-- I'm really... I'm scared of letting myself go to, uh... talk about anything right now. [laughs] I don't know... if it's just because I'm a grown-up now, um... that people tell me things like "Why do you look so worried?" Or... [sighs] "Why do you have such stress in your face?" Or "How come you can't get a sentence out now?" Or "What the hell is wrong with you?" [laughs] We sat through Neil Simon's Seems Like Old Times with Goldie Hawn and Chevy Chase like three times in a row. That was back in the days when like people could do that. You could just like sit through a movie over and over again. Oh, fucking shit. I don't ever want to turn out like my mother. And I'm scared 'cause... um... when I was little and she was my age that I am now, which is 31, um... she seemed a lot better than she does now. I love my mother so much. As fucked up as it is... I can't escape her. She lives inside me. She's in my hair, she's behind my eyes. She's under my skin. She's... downstairs. [laughs] Uh, I can't do this. Here, sweetie. Take this. I love you. -[Renee] ...But do not distress yourself with imagining. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a [inaudible] discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars. You have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore, be at peace with God, whatever you conceive him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace with your soul. With all its [inaudible], drudgery, and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world.
