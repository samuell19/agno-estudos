Okay. - We've been camping. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - I don't see the point of camping, you're essentially having to pay to be homeless! - No it's called roughing it. It's getting out in the wilderness enjoying nature, being amongst good people, and... - Yeah, homeless, no home, living out, in the dirt, and the bugs. Some people like it. - Why are you looking at the negative points of all this? - Because there are no positive points. - I just said it. - Why can't we do that like at the mall. - At the mall? - Yes! - As in shopping? - I don't know if you guys sound that excited.

You brunch now? - Yes I brunch now. - Do you have mimosas? - Bloody Mary. Um, so I went to that brunch, um, a favorite place of me and my buddies, and I was looking at, across the way, and I saw her looking at me. Kind of had a little connection going on. And uh, anyways I finished my brunch, I got up, and I said you're beautiful and I walked out. And as I'm walking out she yelled something back, I didn't think of anything, anything of it, and uh, one of my buddies is like, she said you're beautiful too. I'm like what, who says that? So I was going out a revolving door, I go right around the revolving door right back into the restaurant, I sit down, and I get her number. And then we go on a date. - And the rest is history. - Wait, didn't you say you already knew her though? What? Didn't you say you already, like met her, or something like that? Just go ahead and tell him. - Yeah she used to be a student of mine. She just graduated, May-June. - From college? - No from - High school. high school. Finally made it through. - She's 18 guys. It's not a big deal. - We, we kind of did the math there. - It's not that, unusual. It's not all that strange. - It's really not. - I mean people have different ages all the time. And besides I mean, it's really only logical. Because like, when you think about it, I mean he taught me everything at school, history, economics everything, and I mean it only makes sense that he teaches me about life! Like, the other day, okay, so he and I were having sex, right, and he has me bent over the back of the couch, - Okay. - and he leaves for a minute, and he comes back and he starts working me, and he brings out a jar of mayonnaise-- - Is there anything else we can talk about right now? - No ok we can just stop, we can just stop now. - I can't let all your little secrets out can I?

I'm kidding. - Is that the Ripper? - Is that the Ripper? Is this the site? - I have no idea. Maybe we should just stay on this, because, it looks the most safe. - We've been on it for like an hour now. Keep going. - Keep going? - a well used road. I mean, all of the offshoots don't look like they have anything. - I really don't know how to turn around here. - We'll probably just run into them, don't you think? The thing is guys, to turn around is gonna be, longer than it is to-- - I know but turning around, at least we might go to where we're actually supposed to be. - But we won't be able to see anything. - I now but what, what's down this path? The trip time has doubled. Whose fault is that? - Uh, where's, where's the itinerary? - I don't know, you said it was in your head. I did say that didn't I? Um, hey Mr. Itinerary?

It's got to be like-- It's hard to believe, I know. - Because you never know what's gonna happen out here, so, yeah we got extra chairs, so remember if you need anything, just let us know, we probably got it in here. And, and don't worry about waking us up, we'll, we'll wake up, we love waking up to help you. We want you to be comfortable. And there's plenty of food. - Yeah! - Right, this is amazing, you guys are like-- Can we get a flashlight, we don't have one.

There's some in there too. - Yeah. - Is there anything you don't have in there? - You want my jacket, are you sure? - I'm fine. - Come closer to the fire. - Okay. - Yes Bo please. - But isn't it amazing how it was like raining non-stop and now boop, really nice? - Oh this weather's insane, this weather's schizophrenic. - It's convinced it's bipolar. - Yeah. - It's kind of nice 'cause you're gonna get like three or four seasons in one trip. - That's one way to look at it. But we have to pack for three or four seasons. The fire is fantastic. - Oh my god. - It really is, thank you. - When was the last time you guys got to do smores? I don't know, but I'm trying a new technique, I got a, I got the cracker on there too. - Who's counting? - 12. - Whoa, wow. - I have no idea, I'm sure. - That's very smart. - Why is your dog named Pickles? - She, you know what, she-- Excuse me. She really liked pickle juice, I had, I had dropped some pickle juice on, when we first got her a little baby, making a sandwich, and she was licking it like crazy, so I gave her a little piece of pickle. - I keep thinking about that guy we ran into. Oh my god! - Oh. - It was the, it was the creepiest thing. When our car broke down we were on the side of the road, this guy with an ax-- - What? - Yes! You guys were coming up today? - I meant, yes, like a few, what, six hours ago, it happened a while ago. He, he just came up to us at our, at our car, with an ax. - Was the car blue? - Yeah, it was like, can I ax you a question? - And he was wearing blue as well, ironically enough. - I think it was some sort of a joke, to be honest. But he's. - I don't know it was weird. He just kept saying - No he was creepy. - "you've been warned." He was challenging Asher. What did he say to you? I didn't even hear half of it. - Well he shook our hands. And he was trying to be friendly but, - No he was just. - I don't know there was something - He said his name was Ripper - not right about that guy. - because he likes to rip trees. He was bald, and he had tattoos on his arms. - Creepy. - Cut off sleeves, an ax. - That's just, weird a little bit. Hey that's real scary. - Have you seen anyone, do you know this person, does he, you know him. - No, I've never seen anyone like that in the area. - Nah, especially at night. - And we've stayed up here... - Are you all right? - Maisy what's wrong? - I just feel like I heard something, like a, like a car, drive... Maybe not. - You're just freaking yourself out. - Yeah. - We were just talking about-- - Listen we're talking about Ripper, and ghost stories and such. Don't worry, everything's all right. Still want to go? Explore? - Excuse me! - I don't know my fellow Warrior Falcons. You would pull that out right now. - It wasn't a joke. - Are we gonna rest on our laurels, or are we gonna venture out and fight something? - Fight what? I don't remember playing anything! You get your sword and you get to fight something. - No, uh... - I'll sit here and cheer you on, how about that? - I think, I think you guys lost your spirit. - Have good old times. - Don't, don't disappoint me. Go Falcons! - I'll help you with the cheer. - I believe in you, and you go, I'll be right here, waving the palms. - No, one go, we all go. - Just don't go so far. - Aren't falcons like solo birds, don't they got to travel alone? - Not this group of Warrior Falcons. - Sounds like a challenge. - Oh. - Yeah. - We want to see you at breakfast. - Yeah. - I would, I would have been, like that as well. - We got a great breakfast planned! - Aw, oh yeah! - Listen! You're either a Warrior Falcon, or you're a chicken! - Oh! - Which is it? - Don't want to be a chicken. - Fine I'll go. - I'm not. - You're going? I mean do you see this guy? I'm never gonna hear the - Let's go. end of this. - Plus we got to get stuff for the Bo-cam, right? One-two-three, Warrior Falcons! - I can see my breath. - Look at the stars.

I was just. You guys are crazy. - Oh, god, watch your step. Be careful. Looks like it was a path. To what? A broken path. I bet there's a McDonald's at the end of this. Listen to this echo! Oh! - All right, right or left? Whoo, whoo! Whoo! - Hello! Hello! - Whoo whoo! - Who! - Oh my god you're gonna attract a pack of wolves! - Asher, check this out.

Oh there's a - What are you doing? - knife in this thing. There's a knife? - That's so creepy. - This is weird you guys. - I don't think you should touch it, it looks like some sort of like ancient ruin or something. Why is it glowing?

Cool come on let's, come on Bo, let's go! - Okay we just need to calm down! - Just look at his hands. - There's a rational explanation for what we saw, all right, you know? - Is there, are you sure? Yeah it could have been, it could have been sap, you know, it could have been uh... - It wasn't sap. - There was nothing rational about that! - It wasn't sap! - It could have been, a reflection, of something, I don't know! - I-It's humid out, it's been raining, it's water, it's falling out. - Did you guys feel that though, did you feel that thing in your chest? - What with those rocks, I mean, - I don't like you guys, I, - rocks don't really-- - I really don't want to be out like this. I knew this was a bad idea.

This is, we're really safe. - Can we all agree that we're not going back there, and that we're gonna get up first thing in the morning and we're gonna - I think we should tell Dave and Stephanie. - I do to. - You guys are over-reacting here I think a little bit. - Don't even leave the-- - They can't know about that, they would have told us, like oh, by the way, don't explore to the left there's this creepy altar thing. - Tonight, okay tonight we'll just, we'll stay here, we'll go to sleep, we'll wake up in the morning, we'll go tell Dave and Stephanie, and we'll get out of here. We'll be fine. Should we put the fire out? - Let's just put it out. Let's just go to bed. - I think we should keep it on. it's fine. Let's just, we'll keep it on. - We'll keep the fire on, that way-- - It'll die off of its own. - It'll cool out by - I'm gonna kill - the time we're all asleep. - Patrick, I'm literally just gonna murder him. I'm gonna kill him! I really am! I hate him so much, I really do! I'm gonna shave his beard off his face, that's what I'm gonna do to him. Shave it right off! - While he's awake, and make him watch! - shave his beard! - All right, I think we're, I think we're okay. Yeah let's just go. - Let's just go to sleep. - Sound like a plan? - Yeah, sounds good. - Oh my god. - Yeah Bo? You can put the Bo-cam off. - Bo-cam off. - Bo-cam out. All right. - I'm tired.

I'll be honest with you Maisy I just want to go home. - I know this is kind of out of your comfort zone buddy, but your doing really good. Thank you. - Yeah? Hmm, what if Asher still wants to go back to that thing tomorrow? - Asher is an idiot, okay? What, I'm, ug... Haven't we watched like 100 scary movies together? What, what do you never do?

If you, if by awesome you mean going home or leaving this place or something I guess, I guess so. - We're not gonna go home, we're gonna meet up with the rest of the gang, and we're gonna have a great time. Are there gonna be public restrooms? - All right well let's shut that thing off and get some sleep. Okay. - Okay. Goodnight Bo. Goodnight Maisy - I love you. - I love you too. - Sh!

Maybe it's in one of those. - checked the tents! - Well check 'em again! - Check 'em again? What happened last night? What did you do with the keys? - I had 'em. - Where did you put them? Where was the last, think, when was the last time you had them? - Last time I gave them to you, 'cause I told you-- - You did not give them to me! - Stop! - I gave them to you! - Stop it, you guys stop! - No I, there was - When, when? - a hole in my pocket! - When did you give them to me? There was a hole in your pocket? - There is a hole, and then I pulled them out, and I gave them to you, I said "Here you go!" You went all right! - Ravi, Ravi, think just maybe where you saw them? - Maybe they just fell out of your pocket when you were doing something? - Okay, the campfire I had 'em. - Okay. - I had 'em at the campfire. - Okay. - Were you wearing this? - I was wearing that. - What else were you wearing? - These pants! - Where are they! - You guys! - I specifically remember giving them to Asher! - You did not give them to me! - Stop! - Stop fighting, you guys! - Stop it! - Stop yelling! Ravi, think! check the tent! Right, that's gonna solve everything! You guys! We, we were, we were at David and Stephanie's place last night for a little bit, maybe they're there! I'm not okay! We're gonna the campsite, all right? Ravi, Ravi think really hard. When was the last time you remember having them? - I had them at the campfire. - You had them at the campfire, and then, and then what did you do? - As we got up to go home, - Dave! - there was a hole in my pocket. - So maybe they fell maybe they fell, - Hey Dave! - Stephanie! - You guys! - What? - Maybe, maybe, - Dave! did we check around the campfire more, did we check - Dave! - the outskirt, area? Why is this out? Somethings wrong! What's wrong? - You guys. - What is it? Oh my god! - Is somebody in there? - Oh my god! - Oh! - Oh! - Pickles! Oh Pickles come here baby, oh my god! - Oh! - You okay, you okay? Stephanie, you over here? - Is anything? - Yeah I can't-can't get it, I can't get it open, I can't, maybe.

They were hurt! - We have to go find them and help them! Dave! Dave! Stephanie! - No we can't! - You guys, this isn't safe! We can't do this here! - This isn't funny, - Dave! - this is really sick! - Dave! Stephanie! - You guys don't go far, don't go far please. You guys, just come back! - You guys! What if it was Ripper? He followed us, he had to have followed us! That's the only thing it can be, that's the only logical explanation here. I knew something was wrong with him didn't I know something was wrong with him, we shouldn't have come here! I told you we shouldn't have come! - We have to get out of here! We have to get out of here! - We have to go, we have to-- - We have to leave! Maybe we can hotwire the car? Let's go to the car. Guys, guys, you guys let's just go back to the car. Maybe the keys to the cars? We have to get out of here! That's it, there's nowhere else we can look, it has to be there! - Dave! Stephanie! Stop yelling, it's not gonna help! Pam is right, we need to get to the car! We could-- - Okay, let's go. - Let's go, let's go! - Let's go to the car! Which way, which way? - Oh my god you're kidding me! - Grab a stick, everyone grab a stick. Grab something! - Where are we going? Maisy! Oh my god! - Do you have something? Maisy,! - Come on! - Guys, I think I found 'em! I found 'em! - Let's go, let's get out of here! - Go go go go go go go go go go! - Get in the car! Well what's wrong? It's not starting. - What? - What? - What are you? - There's no warning, no! Come on! No! Ah. What? The battery's missing. - Oh! - You got - What? - to be kidding me! What does that mean? - The battery's missing. - Come on! They cut out our battery! - That could be Dave! Let's go back! Let's go! - No! - He might be able to help us! Go back? What are you guys waiting for, let's go! What are you doing? - Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait! Hurry up, come on! - Close it, come on let's go! I told you guys I carry a gun. Come on, come on! - Come on Bo! Come on! Could have been Dave? It has to be! Hey. - Follow the trail of blood. - Let's uh, yeah, let's follow this, guys, let's follow, let's follow this blood. It could be him! No, no no no, we, we, everybody we've gotten lost, we got, we've-- - We have to. - No! - Bo you're not deciding this! - We have to! Dave's our only chance, he might have his keys, he might be able to get us to his car, he might be hoping we can help him. I'd just like to point out that I haven't been the one deciding, and look where it's got us! - Calm down, okay? We need to go and see if Dave, - We're going this way man. - can maybe help us, because right now that's our only option. - Bo come on! - All right? - Bo you're gonna be okay, I promise! - We have to stick together. - Let's go! - Come on! - You'll be all right! - Come on. - Now! - L-Look, we, we have a crowbar, we have a gun, we're gonna be okay, come on. - It'll be all right, don't worry! We're here with you. We're not gonna let anything happen to you! - Come on Bo. - Let's go! Come on, stick with me! - Guys? - Stick with me, okay? - Dave! - You really want to do this? Does anything look familiar to anyone? - This way! - Are you sure? - No. Come on Bo. Okay? Yes. Okay. Come on. Where's Dave? Do you know what you've done? You released her! She's gonna kill us all! Where's Stephanie? - I tried to warn you! - It's okay now. - I just shot somebody! I just shot somebody I just shot somebody! - It's okay, it's okay, it's okay! - He was gonna-- - He came at you. - He was gonna kill us okay? What are we gonna do? - I don't know. - Maisy, I knew we shouldn't have come here! - We can bury him. - Yeah, yeah, bury him. Chelsea's gun. , you know? You know? - It's the only thing we can do. - Guys, he killed David and Stephanie. Okay Chelsea, you did the right thing. It's okay, it was self defense. - Chels! - You didn't mean to. - Yeah no one comes back here. - Chels. - No one will ever find him. - Yeah. - No one, he was gonna kill us. - He was gonna kill us. - Okay. - I'll get the shovel. - Yeah? - Yeah I'll get the shovel. - Are you sure? - Yeah, yeah. Yeah. - Be careful okay? - Yeah. Um, I, oh... Is this way shorter? Wait, hold on a second. Okay. All right, so um, I just wanted to point out to anyone who finds this and is watching, it was self defense. Chelsea shot him out of self defense, and, I'm gonna protect them, but this is too much, I'm gonna protect Maisy. That's why I'm getting the shovel. I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna protect them. That's all I can say. - Let's get out of here. Maisy. What are you doing? - Let's go. - So there's no keys. - Nope. - We don't know where their bodies are. - No. - Even if we did, it doesn't matter, we don't know where their cars are. Ours is missing a battery, we're stuck here. - I think tomorrow we need to, we need to stick together and we need to walk down the mountain like, I don't know, a mile and see if we can get cell service and try and call someone because we're not gonna get found. Okay well Ripper's dead. - So you say. - Yeah Ripper's dead, right, so we don't have to worry about that. We'll wake up in the morning. - No no, we need, we need to stand guard.
