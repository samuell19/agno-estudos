"Not beforethe end of the season." "Not while Nicole'sback for homecoming." The season's over. Nicole gets home from schoolon Sunday. We'll have a family meeting. Tell them then. [♪♪] [church bell tolling] [indistinct exchanges] "All hailthe conquering heroes." They deserve it. They've donea great job all season. Oh, I am not complaining. Those two solda lot of newspapers for methis weekend. Which reminds me,you owe me a review. The new Thai place. All right, okay. How about a 1,200-word pitch for somethingthat combines food and travel? Abby, you knowI love your ideas, but if you can't actuallygo to the places-- Have you ever heard ofan armchair traveler? I've donethe food section. I've been to every restaurantin this town twice. -You owe me.-I know. I'm not some new mom with two kidsand a football coach husband anymore. I'm about to be an empty-nesterand I've got great ideas, and maybe some timeto travel places. Stan, I need a change. I'll read it. Thank you. As long as the Thai placehits my inbox... tonight. All right. All right. [sighs] Well, look, I hateto break it up, guys, but we gotta go. Yeah, Kade, your dad and Ihave an appointment in town. Why don't youtake Pops to lunch? Oh, you meanI take him and I pay for it? Exactly. You guys can goto that sports bar with the awfulburgers. And the greasy french fries. And the Bears game!Kick-off in 20. Thanks, Mom. Then come backto the house, Kade. When Nicole gets here, we're gonna havea family meeting. All right. Good thing I'm hungry,'cause you're buying. Cheeseburger, greasy fries,the Bears game... [John]: Thanks for seeingus on a Sunday, Sam. Are you kidding? After that collegerecommendation you wrote for my son? I owe you one. Sit, please. Abby wrote it. I just told herwhat a great kid he was. She did the rest. Thank you. So how can I help? Estate planning? Year-end tax advice? We're, uh... getting a divorce. Come on. You-- John? Abby? Well, I don't believe it. What about counseling? Yeah, we tried thata couple of years ago. It worked for awhile. Okay. Well, I should say first that you each should haveyour own lawyers. We don'twant that, Sam. Used to be the twoof us against the world, but... we've just both been livingparallel lives too long. John has his team and, uh, practices,coaching clinics, film night... And you used tobe there with me. I had a life, too,things I wanted to do. You stopped supporting thatso long ago. That's not true! Yes, it is! You don't even ask meabout my writing anymore. When we talk,it's about the kids. I unload to Beth,you have your... confidante. Whatever you wantto call her. Abby, there's nothing to that. I know what I saw, John. You've seen friendship! And if I do have a friendshipoutside of our marriage, it's becauseI can't talk to you anymore. Look, Sam. We don'tlove each other the way a marriedcouple should. We don't eventalk to each other the way married people should. Nicole's at collegeand Kade's a senior. So I guess... there's nothing elseis keeping us together. You don't want timeto think it over? We're telling the kidsthis afternoon. Okay. I'll draw up the papers. [♪♪] [woman]: One, two,three, four... five, six... and... work around. And through. And wraparound, and... through... Beth? Yeah?Wrap around... Do you rememberhow Dad used to mumble when he was reallyfocused on something? Yeah. Don't remind me. That drove me crazy. You're doing it.Right now. Oh, you've gotto be kidding me. No. Great. Like it's not bad enoughI inherit his thighs, I have to gethis annoying habits, too. When did you startknitting anyway? Seems a little domestic for you. Not anymore. I have sworn off datingto become a spinster. Yeah, right. You haven't spenta Friday night alone since college. Well, that isall gonna change. Besides, have you seen the poolof single men in this town? [scoffs] I might as welljoin a convent. There's somebodyout there for you. Well, I hate to break itto you, Big Sis, but not everyone's lifeturns out like yours. When is Nicolegetting here? I can't stop thinkingabout this family meeting. Uh, she should behere in a few minutes. Well, that is my cue. Don't want to interruptthe family meeting! When did youtake up knitting? Not a peep outof you, Mister. You're inthe doghouse. What'd I do? Something aboutmumbling and big thighs. [♪♪] Man, did you see that? No. Sorry.What'd I miss? Those eagles. The femaledove to the ground and the malechased after her, saved her life. I read about itin science. It's a ritual where the maleproves his devotion. Crazy, right? Yeah. Eagles mate for life,did you know that? For life? Didn't know that. [car horn honking] Hey, come on.Your sister's home. There she is! Mom! Oh! I missed you so much. -Hi, Grandpa!-Hey, sweetie. Oh! -[Nicole]: You look so good.-Hey! Is that my little girl? Daddy! Hi! Oh! Hey, little buddy! Heard about your big game. Way to go! You know I'm, like, a foottaller than you, right? Oh, you're stillmy little buddy. Hey, can you help us out? -Yeah.-Sweet. -Hey.-Hey. -How you doin'?-Hey, man. I knowI should've called first, but I thought it'd bea nice surprise to bring Matt! It's okay,right, Mom? Dad? Yeah. Hey. You, uh, you arealways welcome here. Oh, thank you, sir. I did tell Nicolethat we should call first. The more,the merrier. See? Told you! Best parents ever. Oh, I told Mattyou made lots of food. Tell me you made-- The famouschocolate cake? Oh, yeah! Alreadyin the kitchen! That's for dessert, you guys! And, besides... Uh, actually, we are havinga family meeting. Yeah, what's thatall about? Oh, it's not gonnatake too long, is it? I'm going fishingin, like, an hour. No. Won't take too long. Okay, well, let's go! -Come on in, you!-Get some of that cake! Oh, you look great. We can't tell themwith Matt here. I-- I'll take care of it. Hey. So, uh, Matt... we are very happyto have you here, but we did havethis family meeting planned. Would you mindgiving us a few minutes? Maybe check out the lake? Sure thing. I'll, uh,I'll step outside. Uh, wait.He should stay. He's...practically family. [Kade]:This sounds interesting. But sinceyou're all here... We're getting married! W-Wow! Wow. That is suchincredible news. -Congrats.-[Matt]: Thanks. I-I knowit seems fast, but after spending so much time togetherlast summer, all I could think was how much I loveyour daughter... and how much we wantexactly what you two have. Family. Faith. A love that lasts forever. [Kade]: I can't believe this! My sister is getting married. Now, this is so great. This callsfor a celebration! Unless the family'smeeting can top that, I say it's timefor cake. -Go, cake.-Yeah! Save me a piece. [exhales, stunned] Our daughter... I know. Did Matt call youor anything? No. No, he didn't. Um... ahem-- I'm happy for her, but-- No. I know. We can't tell them now. [knocking] -Hey.-Hey! You want some help? Oh... my little girl. Getting married. Wow. "Wow" as in happy? Or... "wow" as in-- Wow.[sighs] Both, maybe. I'm okay with that. I mean, Matt, he's... he seems great, you know? It's just... how long have you guysknown each other? Seven... eight months? Mom, first of all, we're not gettingmarried tomorrow. We're gonna waittill summer, after Matt graduates. Okay, so a June wedding? Do you rememberwhat you and Dad told me? How I should go for my dreams and how I coulddo anything I wanted? Yeah. Well... I did that. I'm on trackto graduate with honors, and... Matt is my future, Mom. I know it. Okay. I just needed to hear itfrom you. Just the two of us. You know? Yeah. Like allour late-night talks when I was growing up. Exactly. I couldn't have gotten throughhigh school without you. Now you're planning a wedding. We're planninga wedding! I have no ideawhere to begin. Well, you start with that crazy, wonderful loveyou're feeling right now. You hold onto it tight. And if you're lucky, that's where you'll end up. Everything I know about love... I learned from you and Daddy. [chuckles softly] [♪♪] What arewe going to do? I don't know. Nicole thinks we are the happiest coupleshe's ever met. Nearly everybody does. John? Can you do one last thingfor me, beforewe end this? Can we wait to tell themuntil after the wedding? [sighing] Abby... It's gonna ruin her wedding. I can't do it. Maybethey should know. Go into their weddingwith their eyes wide open. Don't say that. Just becausewe can't make it work doesn't meanI want our daughter to have a jaded viewof marriage. How can we fake itfor six more months? We've lived our whole lifefor those kids. We can do this. They'll figure it out. Okay, soit won't be easy. [exhales wearily] I guess...we can try. But if things between us,if they get too bad, we have to tell them. Okay. So... June? Yeah. June. Listen, I-I could unpack and you could turn intoa nine-year-old again. Dad... Next time you see me, it will be six weeksbefore the wedding. Thank you, Mr. Reynolds.This was a great vacation. You can call us"John" and "Abby" by now. John. Oh. No. "Mr. Reynolds." You're right. I'm just kidding!I'm kidding. I think there will bea lot of phone calls. Lots! Nothing but school worktill June. June. Thank you. Bye, guys.Love you. Okay. Bye. Bye! [♪♪] [♪♪] [Pastor]:There's the beautiful bride! Oh, Pastor Mike! I'm so glad you'redoing our wedding. Are you kidding?I wouldn't miss it. You must be Matt. Pastor, thank youfor meeting with us. Call me Mike.Please. Let's sit. College chorus,last year. Matt couldn't sing a note,but needed art credits. He even tried outfor a solo. He was awful! [laughing]But adorable. [Matt]: Why elsewould a tone-deaf guy like me join the choir? [Nicole laughs] Except... to get the most beautifulgirl in the world to notice me. That's veryromantic, Matt. Which is whywe're here, right? To talk about what happenswhen the romance wears thin? Daddy! [Pastor Mike]:Actually, he's not wrong. Romance does fade. That's why marriage is basedon commitment and not feelings. John, maybe you and Abbycould tell us how you've managed to keepyour commitment so fresh all these years. Well, three monthsafter we first married, your mother and Ihad a terrible fight. It got so bad,that she left the house, and she was gone so long,I was sure she left me. Well, what did you do? He made the worst browniesin the history of the world. [laughs] If something can be rawand burnt at the same time... But, after that, we just, uh, we sat downat the kitchen table and we talked. Yeah, we talked about how we had to give each otherthe benefit of the doubt and operate from kindness. And faith in each other. Oh! And dancing. You told me that, Mom. "Never stop dancing."Right? Yeah. That's great. Let me walk youthrough the ceremony. [Nicole]: Yeah. Hey, um, I'll makedinner tonight. You go relax, okay? With Dad at school,just-just go hang out. Are you sure? Yeah. You've doneso much already. Okay. Go on. Okay. Take a load off.Love you. [exhales heavily] [♪♪] [sighs] How did I end up with Martha Stewartas a defensive coordinator? Don't knock it. I'm saving youa ton of dough here, man. Do you have any idea how mucha good seamstress charges? I can't say that I do, no. Well, zigzag stitchingdoes not come cheap. How'd the churchmeeting go? Uh, you knowhow everyone says I'm so calm all the time? "Ice Man." No better coachwhen the game's on the line. Yeah, well, "Ice Man"nearly had a meltdown. Ooh. [exhales] Not surprised. Like, you lose a game,people hate you for a week. But, uh, daughter's wedding? Mess that up and... well, uh,you get the picture, right? Thanks.I feel so much better. Good talk, Sol. Any time, buddy. Laundry time. You will make somebodya fine wife someday, Sol. [Sol]: Hey, Charlene. Well, hey, heads up--he's a little twitchy. [whispers]:Wedding jitters. Let me guess-- you can't standyour future son-in-law? Uh, no, actually,he's, uh, he's a nice kid. He'll makea great husband for Nicole. Money?I mean, weddings can becrazy. True. I always thought if I spent half my salaryon something, it would be a bass boat... But no, that's--that's not it, and I really can'ttalk about it. Are you sure? I'm happy to bethe sounding board, like always. There's justsome personal stuff going on at home. I need your input on some of thesestudent council applications. Some of them put you downas a reference. Uh, yeah.I'll take a look. Oh, and I have a new number, so I will text itto you later, just in caseyou wanna talk. Okay. Thanks. Okay. [laughs] [♪♪] [laughter and chatter,overlapping] Those tulips are coming up,aren't they? Guys, that was great. You know, Nicolealways talks about these family dinnersby the lake. Yeah, we've had a lotof good times out here. Anniversaries,birthdays. And now this. But this isthe first time we've ever welcomedan in-law. Cheersto the new guy. New guy. To the new guy! [glasses clinking] Welcome. Oh, Mom and Dadeven got engaged out here on the dock. Go on, Dad. Tell him. Oh, that was a long time ago, back when it wasjust an old fishing dock. A lot's changed since then. Matt, tell usabout your parents. They must beso excited. Well, they can't believe I'm marrying the daughteroftheJohn Reynolds. They used to watchyour football games on TV all the time. I mean, this is, like,way before I was born. [groans] Oh! Wow. And you were doing so welluntil then. I'm sorry. Actually, my mom evenremembers you in the stands. Ahh! Like John said,that was a long time ago. Who wants dessert? Oh! Me, please. Yes! [Kade]: Thanks, Mom. Ah, there she is. Hey. Hey. Everything okay? Of course,why wouldn't it be? Well, you just... well, you seemeda little sensitive to all that talkabout you and John. [forced chuckle] It's not about us, it's a partyfor Matt and Nicole. Right, right. The fact thatyou and John have been sleeping inseparate beds for six months? That's ridiculous. Sweetheart,I might be getting old, but I'm not stupid. It's just a rough patch. Every marriage has them.It's no big deal. A rough patch is one thing, but when two peoplestart leading separate lives-- Dad! Seriously. It's okay. Okay. [weary sigh] I don't knowwhy I waited this long. Yeah, why did youwait so long? Well, there weren't any good boutiquesnear the school, and I wantedto do it with you, but six weeks out,no dress... We'll find it. There are 300,000for us to choose from here. Which meanswe'll find my dress after the wedding. Perfect. You could always go in... this direction. Thank you, Aunt Beth,but I think I'll pass. You wantcap sleeves, right? Okay, so let's juststart with that. We'll narrow it down. Wait. Mom! Yeah? I know. Why don't Iuse your wedding dress? It's beautifuland vintage, and available. No, it's all frayed. I don't even know where it is. But it's lucky? There has to be something here.Let's all take a rack. [phone buzzing] The caterer! I forgot I'm supposed tobe there in 15 minutes. I-I guess we'll try againtomorrow. Okay. Okay. Thanks, Mom.Love you. -Love you.-Thanks, Aunt Beth. These wedding boutiquesare going to kill me. If I hearone more "muzak" version of Pachelbel's "Canon" while I look at tulleand lace... Abby, what's going on? Nothing. I'm not supposedto talk about it. Let's just say... John and Ihave seen better days. Well, you've been marriedfor over 20 years. You're due for a dip. It's more than a dip. We talked to a lawyer. What? How come you didn't tell me? We wanted to keep it a secretuntil after the wedding. We decided, uh...a while ago, in December. No. No. No, no. Maybe I just need to gobe on my own for a while. Maybe I'm supposed to go and be that travel writerthat I always wanted to be. Maybe giving up on that dream is something that startedthis whole process. Do you think? Do you remember the plan? The plan was that I would be there for himduring the season, and he would be there for meoff-season. Well, maybe now,with the kids gone, you can reclaim that dreamtogether? How? A tripdown memory lane. Remind yourselveswhat you built. I don't knowhow to do that, Beth. I do. Sometimes, a picture reallyis worth a thousand words, especially whenthey're pictures of your life. Or your marriage. Step one... Pick out a scrapbook. Okay. Let's see... Mm. I can makea wedding present for Nicole. Perfect. I've been meaningto go through this jumbleof pictures. Let's see... Oh... Look. Oh! Well, that's your opener. The first pictureof our blushing bride. [take a deep breath] Okay. [♪♪] [thud] [footsteps] Oh, you're here. Good. I thoughtyou were with Matt today. Oh no, he's at the high school,working out with Dad. Mom... I can't do it. Honey. You can't-- What? Did something happenwith you and Matt? No, no. It's nothing like that. It's just... [sniffles]I've got a million things to do. The party favors,the centerpieces... My dress!I don't have a dress! How can I help you? Um, party favors,centerpieces, my dress? Mom, I was so busyat school. I bet, if we buckle down,we can get it all done, and have timeto treat ourselves. [deep breath] Okay. Yes. Oh, thank you so much. I love you. [exhales deeply] [weary groan] Oh. [door opens] [laughing] You look likeyou've been run over by a train. Worse. I just worked outwith my future son-in-law. I saw you guys. You didn't look like you hadtoo much trouble keeping up. Oh, I don't know. He wants to bein peak shape for the wedding. I just want to be ableto brush my teeth later. Sit up. Turn around. Really? Mm-hmm. You give the best back rubs.Have I told you that? A few times. Aw, you know, I don't--I don't get it. Abby and I used to belike them... always doing be our bestfor each other. [deep breath] I guesswe just stopped trying. Mm, sounds like my marriage, or what I rememberof it anyways. I guesseven the happiest couples start to take each otherfor granted. You know, rumor has it that Prince Charmingand Cinderella took separate vacationslater in life. [chuckles] Right. Thanks. Yeah. Much better. [exhales deeply] Oh. You and Abby are strong.You'll get through this. John? We have an attorney... drawing up papers. What? I'm not supposed tosay anything, but... I-- I had to tell someone,you know? Of course. Oh, John, I'm-- Yeah, we decidedfive months ago, but because ofall this wedding... You gotta promise meyou won't say anything. I-I mean it. Absolutely. Five months... Yeah. Must have beenreally hard for you. I'm glad that you havesomebody to talk to. And promise me you're not gonna tryto be Mr. Tough Guy. Since when do I tryto be Mr. Tough Guy? You were there for mefor my divorce, and I'd really liketo return the favor. You have my number. Bye. [♪♪] The fitting! Oh! Okay, right here. Selfie forthe wedding album! Ah, I hope we don'toutshine the bride. I don't thinkthat's going to be a problem. There he is. Hey, fellas. Sorry.I got hung up at the school. We're just finishing. He's all yours,my man. Thanks. 46-tall. And what should I do with this? Oh, I don't know.Burn it? What's wrongwith my sweatshirt? No offense, Dad, but it's allyou ever wear. With thosebaggy sweatpants... He's got a point. A little fashion makeoverwouldn't kill you. If you don'tdo it for yourself, do it for Mom. Have a little pride. Okay. I get it.Thanks, guys. We're gonnatake off. We'll see youback at the house. Thank you. [♪♪] What do you think? Hmm? Oh? "Princess Bride."I like it. Me too. Mom! What? [♪♪] It's perfect. It's the one. It is absolutelybeautiful. Check number one. [giddy chuckle] [♪♪] -Oh, Mom!-Yeah? Oh, hey. Maybe one of theseat each place setting, filled withsomething special. Um... oh! Matt'sfavorite jelly beans. Yeah, the sour ones that make your faceall puckered, and-- Yeah, that'll beperfect for pictures. Okay. Check number two. [♪♪] [in unison]:For the table! [both laugh] Little candleson both sides. Yeah, whatdo you think? I think the only thingmore beautiful will be you. Wait! Is thatcheck number three? It is. You knowwhat that means? [indistinct conversation] Thank you. [exhaling deeply] Best day ever. Oh! I so needed this. Me too. Are you feeling better? Oh! So much better. I think maybe I was freaking outabout getting married, like it's all happening so fast! [sighs deeply] Was it like thatfor you and Dad? Did you ever doubt yourself? I never did. No, I couldn't waitto marry your father. Mm. That's howI feel about Matt. Do you remember it, Mom?When you and Dad were engaged? Your dadwas very determined. He always tried hardat everything he did. That's why he'ssuch a good coach. Oh, and Dad. And Dad, yes.He is a wonderful dad. You and Kade arelucky to have him. Oh, no. You too. Dig in. [inhales sharply] Okay! Mm. What do Ifeel like today? [♪♪] Dad, you look amazing! Oh, that's whatI'm talking about, Dad. It's just a coat, guys. And Supermanjust wore a cape. Can I help you? You look nice. Thanks.The place looks incredible. Thank you. Are you readyfor the toast today? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Shower in T-minus-20! Ooh! Hey-hey. No.I'm not dressed yet. Go. I got this. Okay. Keep him away. Wait for it.Wait for it. [♪♪] [Matt]:Nicole doesn't know this, but I joined the chorus just-- Matt doesn't know it, but it wasn't chorus classwhere I fell in love. It was karaoke night. "Bohemian Rhapsody"? All 25 off-keyminutes of it. [laughing] Hi! Excuse me. How are you? Hey, guys.Are you having fun? Oh, the foodis incredible. I mean, you should startoffering your recipes up to the placesthat you review-- which reminds me... Already in your in-box.New Italian place. I love you. I senttwo more travel pieces to you. Just read them.That's all I ask. I still need you where you are. [laughing] Oh, what are some of the others? John, tell themsome of the others. What, Abby talkingin her sleep? Oh, they're legendary. Uh, "No, no,you wash the cat!" "Everyone,stop throwing houses!" [laughing] Every time she justsits straight up, and makes these proclamations, and them fall right back asleep. "We don't even have turtles!" Okay, Abby,is this story true? Beth will tell you that, yes,I do talk in my sleep, but John embellishes. Hey, Beth. Oh, hi. Not bigon crowds, huh? Nope. I never knewyou were a knitter. I'm boring like that. [chuckles] Kind of dabblein the yarn arts myself. You? A... A knitter? A lot of coaches are. Well, maybe not a lot. Probably just me,but they should be. It's a lotlike football. Really? How so? Well... a-a pulling guard,for example. It's a lot likeyour basic brioche stitch. May I? Sure. Thank you. So... Start with an edge stitch, slip one, purlwise together. And if everybodydoes their job... Touchdown! [laughing] Um, can-- can I get you a drink? Sure. [ring clinking glass] [crowd quiets down] Uh, everyone, if I couldhave your attention? Uh, we haven't hadthis many people in the house since I went 0 and 12in my first season. [laughter] Lots of good memories. Uh, you all seem happier now, but today is aboutour amazing daughter and her big day. And since Abby is the writer, I made her write the toast,so, Abby? [crowd chuckling] [deep breath] Nicole... since the momentyou came into this world, you have aimed for joy. You know how to grab it. You have brought so much of itinto our lives, every day-- still. We only hopethat this marriage feeds your contagious smile... and lifts your giant heart. May God smile on both of youforever. Cheers. [all]: Cheers. Now I'm gonna go in the kitchenand have a good cry. [laughs] Thank you, Mom. [crowd applauds] You always did havea way with words. Great speech. It was really-- Nicole's very happythat you're here. Aww. She was so goodin student council. This is just a wonderfultime in her life. Need some help? No. I'm good. Hey... John told me aboutwhat's going on, and if there'sanything that I can do... It's okay.I didn't say anything. He made me promise. What exactlydid he tell you? About the divorce. I understand whatyou're going through, believe me, so if I can helpin any way... [♪♪] Uh, excuse me. What is it?Did something happen? I'm leaving. Leaving?What are you talking about? [♪♪] I didn't invite her. You toldher? Our own kidsdon't even know, John! I'm sorry. Abby, I am. We were just talkingand it slipped out. Oh, just slipped out? How'd that happen, exactly? "Oh, how was your day? Oh, by the way, Abby and Iare getting a divorce?" You know that's nothow it happened. Like you said,I can't talk to anyone about it, I can't talk to you. Come on! What am I supposedto tell people? Tell them I went out for ice. I'll be back in half an hour. Abby... We were having a nice day.Things were-- Abby? [breath catches] I saw the texts, John. I saw all your texts with her. How she hasa "new number"? How she wantsto "help" you? How you're her hero?Sheowesyou? I was helping herwith kids at the school-- If you are falling for her, have the decency to wait until after the divorce. She was there for me.That's it! -She's "there" for you?-Yeah. How's that supposed tomake me feel? After over 20 years, and now she's the one that--after-- Let me tell you something. No matter what has happenedbetween us the last few years, I have been here. I have been the one. I can't do this. Abby, will you wait? Dad?Where's Mom going? She just went for ice. Back to the party.Let's go. All right, all right. Hey! Hi. Beautiful morning. You know, I always lovedthis time of day on the lake. Hey, um...you got a minute? Sure. Let's walk. So, Matt has left the honeymoon planningup to me. I found this amazingbed and breakfast three hours upstate. It's calledThe Sweet Dreams Inn. Ooh. That looks nice. Is there a problem? The host has calledand said they're doing some paintingwhile we're there. She promised me it's on the other sideof the suite I booked, but-- You want to drive upand check it out? That's just it. With the weddingless than three weeks away, I don't have a spare second, and I want it to bea surprise for Matt, so... I thought you and Dadcould take a quick trip. I know, I know it's a lot,but it would really help us. I could do it,but I don't think Dad can. No, no, I talked to him,he said it was fine, but just wanted meto check with you. Uh, well... Mom?Are you two okay? Like, you took offkind of suddenly from the shower and ever since then... No. We're fine. We're just focusedon you and Matt. You two havea wedding anniversary coming up and we've been monopolizingeverything. A three-hour drive upand back, a night alone, could give you twosome private time. Dad said he'd like that. Dad said that? Okay. We'll go. Oh, my goodness.Thank you so much. You're the best. That's a lotoff my plate! The wide-out'llbe open all day, no matter who we play, but if Sanders doesn't growsix inches over the summer, we don't have a chanceagainst Jefferson. Not for two years. Hi. [knocking on door] Hey, Abs.What brings you here? I brought Kade some lunch. Growing boy. Do you have a second? Yeah. I'll be right back. Uh, did you tell Nicole that we were gonna be goingon an overnight trip to a bed-and-breakfast? I did, yeah. We need to talk sometime. Sam's officecalled the other day. The papers are ready. Oh. Papers. No, it's just... [sighs] Look. We've been so wrappedup in this wedding, and miscommunicating, that we should talk. Just... talk to each other,you know? I'll bookseparate rooms, but if you'd justgive me a chance-- [Sol]: Hey. Just got an emailabout a prospect over at Mills, that-- No. Abby was just deciding if we were gonnago on a road trip. Cool.

And I'm sorry if... did I blow everything? I think we did this together. We both... accepted less from each otherthan we should have. I thinkwe both kind of blew it. [♪♪] [door opening] Ah. You're awake. You didn'thave to do that. I brought muffins, too,for the road. What's that? Scrapbook. Beth got me started. I'm makinga wedding present for Nicole. I haven't seenthese pictures in years. Yeah, I'd forgottenabout some of them, too. Look at this one.Remember that? That's your first yearat Langley High. That might bethe only good memory from that first season. [chuckles] You survived it. We survived. Look at this. I think the only personmore excited than me that day was your father. Mm. This one'smy favorite. Our little girl. She's so beautiful. Just like her mom. Nicole is gonna love this. [♪♪] [knocking] Come in. I'm sorry. Mrs. Reynolds' sister called. Beth? She couldn't reach youon your cell phone. It's your father. Beth! What happened?Is he okay? He had a stroke. Oh, no.This is terrible. It was minor, but he's notout of the woods yet. He's at riskat having another one. [♪♪] Dad. Hey! Did I hear that you twowent on a second honeymoon? You scared usto death. I told Beth not to call.I'm fine. Are you kidding me?A stroke is not "fine". What am I gonnado with you? Don't worry about me. You have a weddingto pull together. No, Pops, we canpush the date. Don't you change a thing. I'm fine. Okay, okay, look, I need everybodyto give me a minute. I want to speakto your dad in private. Kids. You too, Abby. Oh. Okay. I'll beright outside, okay? Fine. Hey, Pops.What's going on? [sighing] Come here. Look. In case this whole stroke thing goes sidewayson me-- You saidyou were doing fine. Right. But no matter how old she is,Abby is still my little girl. It's my jobto protect her. You don't just stopbeing a dad. I-I get that. Which is why I need youto make me a promise. Just in case. Yeah. Anything. I need you to love her. Dad? You heard me. Love... her. John, I know that thingsaren't right between you. I want to tell you something that neither Bethnor Abby knows. Her mother and Ialmost called it quits. You and Ellie? You know betterthan anybody-- what's on the outside can be differentthan the inside. But a marriageis a house. You invest in it, you make the repairs... and you love it... because inside is everything that ever meant somethingto you. Ellie and I never walked away from what we spenta lifetime building. I just wish... I wish we hadmore time together. This isyour house, John. This is your life. It's more complicatedthan that, Dad, I think. She stood by you. She madesacrifices for you. She didn'tdraw attention to it, and she never will, because she did it out of love. Now you have tolove her. All the way to the end. I'll try. I-I am trying. I'm a sick old man, John. [laughs] Promise me. I promise. That's my boy. [♪♪] [♪♪] Final count? Uh, 76, with two "regrets". That's what I got. Okay, I will email the caterer. Ooh. Two weeks. I can't believeit's already here. The wedding... or what happensafter it's over? Both. You know, I've beenmaking that scrapbook and looking through old photos, and I keep coming backto this one of when John and Iexchanged vows. We were so young. But so certain. I can't stop thinkingabout young Abby and John, at the end of the aisle... Those 22-year-olds trusted us. They believedthat we could go all the way. They'd be so disappointed. [Beth]: You don't have todisappoint them, you know. [doorbell chimes] I'll get it. [Abby sighing] Oh. Those are beautiful. Come on in. Put them over there,with the others. She's got a garden growing. Thank you. More flowers for the bride. [exhales wearily] There you go. We havea wedding in 10 days. I know. Okay. Take it.Take it, take it. Yeah. And... ah!Touchdown! Oh... Ahh... Good job. [exhales] Now it's your turn. What? Abby, John is trying. [groans] Dad. I've seen him. What about you? It's weird. Sometimes, we feel like"ourselves" again, but... I don't know. The last few years... I don't thinkwe're going to make it. How did it get so bad? Do you even know? I've been blaming himall this time, his football, Charlene... But I let it happen, too. I remember the month beforeyou walked down the aisle, how he brought youa dozen red roses every day. Every day, Abby! You remember? He worked all summerfor those roses. And when you werelaid up on bed-rest, pregnant with Kade? He went and got every kind of foodin this town for dinner... ...for you, for two months. It wasso long ago. Things change. People grow apart. All you ever wanted to dowas to marry that boy. It's latein the game... but there's still timeleft on the clock. You can stillchoose to stay. You can choose love. [♪♪] [♪♪] "Meet me at the pier." 6:00. [♪♪] [phone rings] Hello? Abby. It's Stan. Oh, hi, Stan. Can I call you back? I think you're gonna wannamake time for this. Can you be at the officein 10 minutes? Um... I'm meeting Johnin an hour. It won't take that long. Trust me. You'll be glad you came. Oh, Stan,why do you do this? See you soon. [beep] [indistinct exchange] Okay, what's so important? Did I win a Pulitzerfor my restaurant review? Actually... say helloto Gabrielle Pender. She owns a string of newspapershere in the Midwest. I am a big fan. Oh! Hi. You likemy food column? Actually,your travel pitches. Stan was kind enoughto forward me a few... dozen. You thoughtI threw them away. I knew you were good, and now Gabrielleknows how good. I'd like to offer youa trial spot in my papers. If it goes well, it could lead to a columnof your own in syndication. Can you join usfor a few minutes? Sure! Yeah. If the response is good,we'll expand the markets, help you buildan audience. If that goes well,down the line, we are lookingat sending you away five to six times a year. Do thinkyou can handle that? Sign me up! I told Gabrielleyou could do this. You've always beenmy ace reporter. "Ace Reynolds." That's my Abby. "Ace..." What time is it? [Gabrielle]: Almost 7:30. Oh, I can't believeI've done this. I'm so sorry. I have to go. [♪♪] [♪♪] John! I'm so sorry. Yeah. Me too. I'd offer you somecheese and crackers, but I gave it to the ducksabout an hour ago. Seemed only right,since they were here on time. Well, I'm here now, so we can still do this. Why? Why? Because we were-- I'm showing up, Abby. I'm doing thingsand I'm showing up. I'm showing up,too, John. I came to the school,like I used to, the bed and breakfast-- You know, maybewe're just fooling ourselves. Don't you even want to ask mewhy I was late? Does it matter? Maybe it does to me. I'm putting myself out there. I sent you the license plate-- Which I loved. [chuckles sadly] Yeah. Seems like that. Something goodhappened for me tonight. Me too. I got completely clear about howwe're fooling ourselves. I'm gonna sleepin the guest room. I don't want to pretend anymore. John! Oh, and, uh... here. These came in the mail. You invited me out here tonight so you could give methe divorce papers? Great. No. I was going to rip them up. I was gonna talk. But this is what it's come to. [♪♪] [footsteps] Hey. [exhales deeply] I heard about Pops. How is he? Determined to danceat the wedding this weekend. That man is a powerhouse. [chuckles] You don't look good. Here... This'll help. It's my guilt offering, 'cause I feel awful about what happenedat the shower. I-- Don't. Don't. I think it would'vehappened sooner or later. Abby and I justneed to figure out how to get onwith our lives. And the kids? We'll tell themafter the wedding. Nicole will be goneand Kade'll be off to school, and the kidsjust don't need us anymore. [scoffs] Who'd have seen thiscoming, huh? Me and you? Sitting here... broken marriages... crying on each others'shoulders? Well, I can think ofworse places to be. Uh, Charlene, if... you know,if I've given you the wrong ideaabout things... You didn't. It's just... no matter how bad things are, the truth is... I'm still in love with my wife. We're friends. I get it. [♪♪] A-Ab-- [quietly, pained]: No! Uh-- Abby! [♪♪] Abby-- Abby! Just stop! It wasn't what you think. It doesn't matterwhat I think. You made it very clear.You're moving on. Hey! No! That's not-- Can we please talk? We both did this, okay? We weren't therefor each other. We didn'ttake care of each other. We didn'tlove each other. All the way to the end. [♪♪] Sorry, Nicole. This is not muchof a bachelorette party. Chardonnay and a bucketof vanilla ice cream. Oh, no, no.It's perfect. I can't think of a better way to spend my last nightas a single lady than with you two. I love you both so much. Mm. We love you, too, baby. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go make a phone calland take a walk. Oh... [playfully]: M-a-t-t...Wherefore art thou? Oh! [both laughing] Leave her alone.She's in love. [♪♪] [line ringing] [ringing] Hello? Hey, Dad! Are you gonna be home soon? Yeah, almost, kiddo.Everything okay? Yeah, it's just it's kind of my last nightas your little girl. [chuckles] You'll never stopbeing my little girl, ever. Ever. Ever. Okay, okay. Hey, I know it sounds silly, but could we saybedtime prayers one more time? Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that a lot. Thank you, Lord, for a daughter betterthan I could ever imagine. Guide her on Your path to happiness, protect her heart, keep her safe and loved, all the days of her life. God in heaven, thank you for the blessingof loving parents and family who have guided me so well. I love you, Daddy. I love you, too, little one. Goodnight. [beep] [sniffles and sighs] [♪♪] [quiet chatter] [knocking] Mom! Come in. Oh... sweetie. How do I look? Like the most beautiful bridein the whole wide world. I mean it,you look stunning. Okay, okay, stop.You're gonna make me cry, and I workedreally hard on my makeup. [laughs] I made you something. What is this? Open it. [♪♪] Oh, Mom... [chuckles] Oh, this is amazing. When did you have time? Here and there. Do you like it? I love it! I don't know, I guessI just wanted to show you what love looks like, so that you and Mattcould have what we had. all these years. [sniffling] Okay, I should get downstairs. Guests are arriving. Mom? I love you. I love you too, baby. [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] Who gives this womanto be married? Her mother and I. I love you, baby. I love you, too, Dad. Matt and Nicole, you've chosen a beautiful placefor your wedding, but, apparently, we aren'tthe only ones who think so. This morning, your brother reminded me that a pair of eagleshave been living on this lake even longerthan your mom and dad. "Those who hope in the Lordwill renew their strength. "They will soar on wingslike eagles. "They will run "and not grow weary. They will walkand not grow faint." Matt and Nicole, our prayer is that you'll livelike eagles. Never grow weary,never grow faint, never lose heart, and never let go. The rings? [♪♪] And now, becauseyou've declared your love before Godand all of us here... I now pronounce youhusband and wife. You may nowkiss the bride.
