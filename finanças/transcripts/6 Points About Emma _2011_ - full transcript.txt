Wouldn't it be great if you could read a pregnancy test... one stripe, one bark... two stripes, two barks... eh, Rosca? So? ...one stripe. Okay... Sorry... So am l... Emma, wait! Listen, -listen to me for a minute please... -Don't follow me, please. Emma, come on, you're not going to dump me because l haven't been able to make you pregnant. lt's not just that. l'm not in love with you. Never have been. Even if you'd got me pregnant, l'd have left you anyway. SlX POlNTS ABOUT EMMA lntroduce yourself whenever you want. My name is Emma... Tell us something about yourself... Do l have to? l don't know what l'm doing here, really... l've come to listen to you. Nobody comes here just to listen. Okay... l'm twenty nine... l don't know if l look it or not. Cause l can't see shit. Anything else? What do you do? Yes, l work on the Telephone of Hope. l studied psychology, but never finished it. Telephone of Hope, good evening... Hi, Emma. Marcos, just as well, l need to talk to you... But don't think l'm Mother Teresa... l get paid for it... so l'm not deserving of admiration. Basically, l take calls and coordinate the service. l show the volunteers the right way... to give hope to the world. And if you know the secret of hope? Why do you think you've come here? 1. Starting point Well, because l suppose... now and again l need to be told everything will be all right too. l guess. Right, very good Emma, thanks... and now to work. Hi... Hi... l'm...from the therapy group. Lucia. Ah, l'm Emma Yeah, you said earlier. Pleased to meet you. Likewise. And what's wrong with you? Me? Nothing, why? You're not blind, are you? lf l was blind l wouldn't have recognized you, would l? Eh, no, sure, l'm so bright... No, mine is worse. l'm paraplegic. Worse, sure, right. Each with his own. Can l ask you something? What's the psychologist like? What? German... what's he like? l don't know, normal, why? Hey, don't spare any details. l don't know what somebody normal. Well... he's pretty tasty... Pretty tasty... that's what l imagined. Take my seat. No, thanks, l'm fine standing. Angela... What? Hi, l'm a nurse, can l help you? Yes. Room 357. Emma! Emma! Angela! l'm here. Thank goodness you came. You can't imagine the scene... my waters broke in the supermarket. Can you imagine? And... it hurts! Okay, deep breaths. Give me your hand! Breathe, breathe, like they showed you in class... l can't remember! l hardly went! Relax. Take deep breaths when you feel a contraction coming... and think of something that gives you peace... l don't know... your fingernails, your nails... Are you a relative of Angela? l'm a friend. lt's a boy. l know. What about the father? Bye then... Oh, okay, bye. What is it, Rosca? Shall we kidnap one? Are you a proud father? l'm a proud uncle. You're Emma, right? How do you know? Are you Diego? Yeah, l'm Diego. How did you know? Just come from Angela's room. She said you'd be here. She's talked so much about you, it's like l know you already. Same here... You here for a few days? A few months maybe, so we'll seeing each other quiet a bit. Well, not me. Relax, l like making you suffer What's he like? Who? The baby. You haven't told me what he's like. He's... l don't know. He's perfect. Perfect. And then suddenly l was introducing myself... to a bunch of complete strangers. Can you believe it? What kind of group is it? Therapy for people with a disability... what a bunch... a deaf girl, two in wheelchairs, a pain in the ass who l don't what her problems was, a mental retard, the only intelligent person there... along with me... all thinking they're the most unfortunate person in the universe, the usual. l don't think l'll go back. l haven't told anybody... only you. Why not? You must have gone for some reason. For somebody to comfort me. l thought that was my job. Problem is l don't even know where you live. Must be cause you never asked me. Must be because you don't want me to. Could be. By the way, the psychologist has a beautiful voice... Okay, it's official, l'm jealous. Yeah, sure... Ok, a deaf girl is walking down the street one day when she meets her friend. The girls says, ''Hi Lucia, how are you?'' and she says ''l'm really happy''. ''How come?'' she says. ''l bought a hearing aid'' ''Oh right, does it work well?'' ''Yeah, l can hear everything... l can hear a pin drop... l can hear the leaves in the tree, everything... ''How much did it cost you?'' ''Eh, at around 8.30 pm tonight...'' Right... Tono...what did you think? l was listening and l didn't think it was funny at all. l've got a much better joke than yours... A blind guy finds some sandpaper in the street... and he feels it for a good... while thinking it's written in Braille, until he can't read any more and... he screams out: ''Who wrote this shit!'' That's a terrible joke! l know a really good one. Did you hear the joke about the deaf guy? No Haven't you heard it? Well. Neither has he. He hasn't heard, cause he's deaf? Get it? Lidia, Tono, what do you think of these jokes? Do they bother you? Offend you? No, but sitting here talking about all this is a waste of time... but it depends on the joke, the content. Some are okay, and some are aren't. There are jokes about everything. You can't take them so personally. l... l have...one... What about terms? How do you prefer to be called? Disabled, handicapped? Sightless? Do you want to hear... my joke? l hate the word ''disabled''. lf l'm disabled, what are you? Abled? l... know a... joke... did you hear about the one about the blind guy? ''PFD'' l like to be called ''Person Functionally Diverse'' l don't want to be called that. Sounds like a computer file. l like to be called Emma, by itself. Emma. Didn't you say you weren't coming back? l want to hear the one about the blind guy. ln you come, Emma. Hi, Emma. -Hi. -Hi. look what l've brought you... Ohhh We're here... we've arrived. Hi, Emma. How's it going, Diego. What about you? How's it going with Jorge? Fine. l mean, no. l'll tell you later... oh, he's sleeping. Yes, but it's feeding time... Goodbye, Aniceto... l don't know if l'll get used to that name... l know it's after his grandad but... can l call him Ani? Ani is a girl's name. l can't stand either of you. l'm in love... l'm a lesbian... You're a lesbian? Not me! Her! Ricky, we're trying to listen to Lidia. Sorry. Sorry, l'm a bit daft today... Lidia, carry on... l'm lesbian, l've had a really bad pain here for ages. l have kept quiet for so long... l'm tired of hiding it. Don't your friends even know? You live it totally in silence? Co...course she lives with it in... silence, -she can't...speak! -Ricky... What? My family doesn't know either. lf l tell them, l think they'll throw me out. For sure. We get lots of calls at the helpline about this... My advice is the always the same. Relax, Lidia, lt's all right sooner or later, you'll be ready to tell them... You'll realise that things are really simple in love and sex. lt's about people, not gender. And if you love, if you have feelings, that's what's important. if you love somebody, you have to tell them. And if you don't love, you should tell them too. Are we talking about Lidia or you? We're talking about me too, yeah. l've decided. l'm going to find the right sperm. 2. Point of no return l'll look for the perfect candidate, but without falling in love. l'll look for the perfect candidate, but without falling in love. Without ties. Or feelings. Without anything. Like the saying, ''What the eyes don't see...'' ''... heart doesn't feel''. Exactly. l won't demand any responsibility from the father. lt would be best if he didn't even know l was pregnant. The child will be mine alone. lt's not so complicated, is it? Put like that... So this Marcos calls the Telephone of Hope but he ends up consoling you. No, not exactly... We've been talking for two years and a bit. He called because he was depressed after his girlfriend left him l assured him it would pass, he'd feel better slowly but surely. And that's the way it was. l know that l shouldn't use the phone for personal calls, but Marcos and me have become really good friends... for good. Why not just give him your mobile number? No, it wouldn't be the same... and why don't you go for a spin and leave me in peace... Cause my battery is flat... Are we going to be on TV? We're going to do something... l'm going to record you on video and we're going to watch it. -Why? -Why? Because when we talk, our bodies give out thousands of messages. Often those signs are the opposite to what our words are saying. lt's called body language. Very good, Reina. No doubt about that image of Ricky, for example. He's as bored as an oyster... And what about those of us who can't see ourselves? Don't worry, if your body betrays you, we'll let you know. l hope so. What's that? His name is Donatello. Last night... l plucked up courage and called him, but l hung up at once. Why do you want to call a gigolo? l guess cause l good really do with getting laid. Look, German. lt's really difficult to explain to somebody l wear nappies and l can't feel anything. Maybe that's why l want to call a gigolo. Do you think it's wrong? No, not at all. You're right. l think l'm going to call Donatello. Don't even think about it! Donatello is all mine! -Would you pay for sex too? -Me? No, l don't need to, l click my finger and l can have whoever l like. But l have a problem, German. l don't think l'm capable of loving anybody. What can l do about that? Emma, did you hear the joke about the blind guy? No. Eli... one question, what's wrong with you? What? Why do you come here, you're normal... not like us. What do you care? l do care. Eli... l drew a picture of you. Why not invite me to dinner every night. Angela only knows how to use the microwave. The last thing Emma needs... is a starving bohemian. How did you learn to cook? lt's not so complicated. l have a cookery book in braille. lt's called ''Cooking for the blind''. Page one it shows you... how to tell the difference between salt from sugar. How? Dipping and tasting... Talking about sugar... what's going on with Jorge? What Jorge? -Who is Jorge? -Who is Jorge? Emma changes boyfriend more than sunglasses... l don't change my sunglasses that often. Diego, if you have nothing better to do, would you mind coming round to read my mail? Of course l know your sister is tired of her role as the official reader of the blind... No problem. l'm bohemian and starving, but l can read. Love... want me to sing you something? No, l don't need to. l click my finger and l can have whoever l like. But l have a problem, German. l don't think l'm capable of loving anybody. What can l do about that? A few days ago l met a girl on chat. We talk every night... and l'm really into her. We've exchanged photos, webcammed. l can tell she likes me too. But the problem is l still haven't told her l'm deaf. l can't tell her, l just can't. The other day she suggested... we talk instead of chat, to hear each our voices. You can imagine, l made up excuses, said my microphone was broken. l can't carry on like this forever. Emma... What number do l have to call for you to give me hope? You can't fool me, you're up to something, right? Hi. Hi Emma. What are you doing? l'm going home. Do you want me to drop you somewhere? l'm going somewhere pretty ordinary. Sorry l was a bit distant today. Where were you? ln a dream l had last night. You remember your dreams? Yes, always. What did you dream? l can't tell you. Why not? Because you were in it. 3. The pleasure point. You could be a dog-washer in your double life. A change would do me good. lt wouldn't do you any harm. Are you tired? No. Do you want to come up for a drink? My balcony has spectacular views. No bad thing for somebody to enjoy them now and again. No, Emma. No. No. No... okay well, fine... what a shame... this hat really suits me. Wait, hold on... Don't worry, l'm on the pill. German? German? And if he's crazy, a maniac with a weird hereditary disease? No way. German is adorable. Adorable? What do you know about him? Nothing. l like his voice... l just need his... You know what l mean. You're incredible. And you let it show too much that you're in love with me. You wish... Daddy, daddy... Lucia, l think you wanted to start today? Yeah... well, l wanted to tell you something... l finally... l'plucked up courage, l did it, yesterday l contracted Donatello's services. And how was it? l think it was great... He was really sweet... and he gave me a discount. How much? Fifteen percent. And does he give a discount to all of his handicapped clients? Oh, Reina... What's the most positive thing you got out this experience? He treated me like just another customer. Who says you're just another customer? At the very least, you must be his youngest customer, old ladies must call him all the time. You're very brave, Lucia... Bravo! Bravo! How was he hung? We're finished... Has everybody gone? Yes. ls the door closed? No. l'm going to do it one more time with him. Just in case his sperm isn't agile. l don't believe you. All you do is talk about this German. You're falling in love. What? Stop No... it's just it's all so exciting. l envy you... or maybe l don't. l don't know. l think that what l miss has nothing to do with sex... it's hugging. l need to be hugged, to sleep next to somebody, to wake up beside somebody. Well l don't. -Know what? -What? Donatello isn't really his name. lt's just his artistic name. What's he called? You're not going to believe it. lndalecio! ln... lnda what? But... he told me l can call him lnda. l like the way he looks at me. He treats so well... Last time he didn't even charge me, and he told me... he never confesses his real name to anybody. Only because l'm special. My head is in the clouds. lt's absurd that a gigolo might like me. No it isn't at all. lndalecio has realised... What? How incredible you are. Thanks. Where are you? Come here... Do you like my legs? Yes. Are you coming up with me? l like your jacket. l'm going to keep it. You've already got one of mine. We'll now l have two. You're putting it on the wrong way around. No l'm not. You're trying to fool me... You're really funny, aren't you? Let's go... Hi. Who was it? l don't know, a neighbour of yours. What are you doing Rosca? Sorry. Come on... Do you like kids? Why? Just wondering. l have to go. Why not stay over with me tonight? l snore a lot. You never stay over. l have to go. Get some rest. Who is it? lt's Diego. -Hi. -Hi. l took your mail out of your mailbox, if you want me to read any important ones. Okay, thanks. Come in. What are they? -What? -The mail... Ah. There's two from the bank and this is probably your water bill. Okay. Leave them wherever. l'll work it out later. What are you doing today? Looking for a job. Ajob? l think l'm going to stay here for a while, help my sister with the kid. She could use it, and l can go back to college later. Nobody is going to miss me there. Don't be silly. How is it going with your boyfriend? What boyfriend? Well, he's not my boyfriend, but fine l suppose... What about you? ls there...somebody? No. l'll leave the letters here on the table. Okay. Thanks a lot. Last night l was talking to Elena, my friend from the chat, she suggested we meet. lt was a bit late l thought, but in the end, l thought l had to be brave and do it... We arranged to meet in a gay bar, a bit fancy really. l thought it would be better than an empty park... And...? l was full of anguish because l hadn't told her l was deaf and dumb. But l went to the bar, l didn't go in, l waited outside to see... her when she arrived. l was a bit surprised when she arrived because l thought she was taller, but no... she went straight in the bar. l wondered again whether to go in or not, or stay, but l didn't want to be a coward again. So l plucked up courage and went in. There weren't so many people in the bar, it was still early. She was looking for me. And when she looked at me she smiled. But l was silent of course, and she started talking to me, but as she wasn't looking at me, l couldn't understand what she was saying, the music must have been very loud. l tried to say something, to tell her l was deaf, but she didn't understand. So finally l pointed at my ears and she said, ''What, are you deaf?'' And l said yes. She looked at me like, and then she said ''Wait a minute'' and she went off, and l thought, she must have gone to the bathroom. l was waiting and waiting, a long time, and so finally decided to go to the bathroom. And when l went in there was nobody there. l went to the bar and she wasn't there either. l like you ln the end... l realised that when she had gone. When she said she had gone to the bathroom, she had left the bar. And what did you do? l went home. l put on my computer and deleted all her photos and chats, video everything. lt's all over... Emma sounds like she's having a party... Maybe she's gone deaf too... Don't be a jerk. l'm going out. Can l use your car? l've no choice. Sleep tight, babe. lf you can with that racket... This one? Out like a light. 4. The turning point Diego? Yeah, don't worry. Don't make a noise, the baby... Sorry. Hi, everyone. Sorry... but they've broken into my car and... l've spent all night at the police station making a complaint. -Four hours. -Are you okay? Yeah. l'm fine. What happened? They smashed on the side window right outside my house. Right... does anybody remember where we were yesterday? What was in your bag? The camera, the tapes, all the stuff from the therapy sessions. l'm just thinking... that thief is really going to have a great time at our expense, with the amount of rubbish we talk in the therapy sessions. l don't find it funny, really. Sorry. Sorry. German? ls that you? lt's Diego. Diego... l was just about to go to bed. Can l come in? Yes. l wish you could see them. Was it you who robbed his car? Something told me you had no idea about this. Can you leave on my own now? Please. No. There's something else. You have no idea what this guy is capable of... l don't want to hear. Please, leave me alone! German, l want to ask Tono... what ''Dublin'' means, if it had something to do with fucking or hookers or...? l don't think so. Who wants to start today? Me. Okay. On you go, Emma. l want to share something with you. Recently l've been fucking with German. Right here in the room, on the floor. Naked. And at my house too. Guess what l discovered... German is married and he has two children. And he's been cheating on his wife with me. What do you think? Didn't you know German is married? l bet you don't know the one about the blind person? Would you mind leaving us alone for a minute? Please. Please. You have no idea what's going on in my life. Tell me about it. You already have. l'm married. l have two kids. l don't have any feelings for my wife, and she doesn't have any for me. Have you done this with other women? No, no. Emma. What? Remember you said... you weren't capable of loving anybody. Well, l think you're capable of loving me... Leave me. Come on. Are you going to leave him? 5. Critical point Do you like singing? Sometimes. l love singing. know what? You and l are not so different. Give me your hand. l'm an expert at hiding it. Did a shark bite you? You're incredible, Ricky. No, you are. l'm going to therapy... Okay, see you in a minute. Hi guys. Hi, German. Hi l've just come to tell you... l've resigned as a therapist at this centre. l want to apologise for my behaviour... and, well, We all are what we do, and... l assure you l wish things had worked out differently. German, will you let me tell my joke? Did you hear the one about the blind guy? No! Tell us. He fell in love at first sight with l-SA BEL C Black... Didn't German like it? Hi. Hi. You've come. That's what we arranged, right? Yeah. Will you give me your hand? Sure. Hi. Hi. l'm sorry, Emma... l know you must think l'm a selfish bastard. But recently, l don't even know what's been happening to me, in the last month my life has fallen apart. And all l know for sure, is l want... l want to carry on with this madness... and for you to be with me. Remember when you asked me in the group for me... to say something about myself? Yes. My name is Emma, l can't bear being told what l can and can't do... and l want to be a mother. l want it 24 hours a day. And now all l have to do is wait. l don't know what you're saying, Emma. l didn't tell you when we met. All this time l've only been trying to get pregnant from you. Or whoever. What for? To love somebody... remember? l don't understand you. l've been blind in lots of ways. l'm sorry for not being straight with you. Sorry. This is yours. Goodbye. 6. Full stop No... sorry. Will you stay over with me? Yes. Just to sleep. Okay. Will you hug me? Of course. Please... please, hug me. ln braille you can write any letter using just six dots. lt's easier than it looks. Looks really complicated to me. No, man. You have to mark the right dots, from right to left. That's the key. That's the key. Well, you have to study the alphabet, the A is one dot, B is two dots... you mark away, with a piece of paper inside, from right to left. The T? Why the T? Cause l want to write something for you. Emma, it's me. Hi. Hi. Can l talk to you for a minute? l was just going out.. lt's just a minute... What is it. Diego told me about the psychologist. That's all over with. And now what? Are you after my brother? You want him to get you pregnant? What's all this about, Angela? l know you, Emma. l know what you're up to and l don't want you to use my brother. Get it? You're obsessed with having a kid, as if that was going to give your life meaning, and you haven't stopped to think for even a minute... if you're going to be able to look after it. You're blind, blind! Shit, you're not even going to be able to see your kid's face...get it? Get out my house, Angela. Sorry, l didn't mean... that. Just go. A kid isn't going to give meaning to your life. You're going to have one, but you're going to see that you're just as scaredand lost as your are now. l assure you... Get out! Get out! Diego will meet somebody soon enough... and he'll forget about me. l'm sure of it. And where will you go? l don't know... somewhere else. Everything is going to work out fine, Emma, you'll see... Yeah... SlX POlNTS ABOUT EMMA Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl? You most certainly can.
