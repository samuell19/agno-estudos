- Tick... Tock... Tick... Tock... Tick... Tock... Tick... How long do you think we've been here? - How much further, Margot? - I don't know. - You don't know? Didn't Gottfried show it to you on the map? That rest stop was unacceptable! - Did you see those kids next to us? - I thought they were cute. - Goddamn hippie parents couldn't keep them in check. - Please don't drive so fast. - They deserved a good slap in the face! - Dieter! - I'm glad we're never having kids. - As if we have a choice... - I've been on the road for hours now! - I'm tired. - I just want to inspect that castle, and then head back to the hotel! Is that too much to ask? - No, of course not. Dieter, what if there's someone inside? - Nonsense! Don't be absurd! - You never know. - A dump. No surprise there. You kept bragging about this castle, and now look what we have. A pigsty. What a shit show! There's no electricity. Your uncle said that this has been empty for how long? - I don't know. Seems like a while. - Well, your uncle was the one who inherited all the money. I bet he's having a good laugh about us getting this dump. I'm sick of it. Your family has all this money, and all we get is their garbage! Renovating this place will cost us a fortune. Nobody will want to buy it like this. - There's a market for everything. - So you're a real estate agent now? I'm going downstairs. - You have to do that now? Can't you wait until morning? During daylight? - Margot, "The thoughts are clearest at night." Your uncle kept going on about the wine cellar. I'll take a quick peek. Stop nagging. Why are we still here? - Just give me some time. - We have all the time in the world. I can already feel the fungus growing in my lungs! - Cheers! - Wine cellar... As if! Gottfried, you stingy bastard. Goddamnit! - Hello? "Silence is death." - Who said that again? - Nobody. - "And time keeps flowing persistently." - Margot? Margot! - Dieter... So did you manage to find anything? - In the cellar? - Mm-hm. - I think it's best to check it out during daylight. - During daylight? If you say so. - Yes, grab your things. We're going to the hotel. - You want to go now? - Now! Did you take my car keys? - Me? Is that a joke? You never trust me with them! - In the cellar. I must have dropped them. - Then go get them. - There's no way I'm going back down there. - You don't want to go? Are you scared? Alright, then I'll get them. - I can't let you go down there. - Good. Then we'll just have to spend the night here. That you always have to pressure me... - The perfect marriage... You, chained up in the basement... And I'll come visit you once a week. And while I'm cleaning my nails while going upstairs, I'll think, "No need for a divorce." - I never know what you're talking about. Margot? - Hmm? - You're a flower in the bushes. And that's all you'll ever be. Do you hear that? She's screaming for help! - Stop it, that's not funny! - She's saying that you locked her in here. - Why are you doing this? - Margot! Be sensitive. Please! Margot? - Entirely different during the day, right? - How long have you been awake? - Since dawn. - You could have woken me. - I wanted to let you sleep in. As a child I always woke up this early. I sat at my window and watched the sunrise. That always made me sad somehow. A bit silly, I know. - No, it's not silly at all. It's beautiful here, right? So different from last night. It will take a bit of work to restore this place. But... I'm sure we'll make a good profit when we sell it. What's wrong? - Nothing. - Something's up. Was it something I said? - No, everything's fine. - I'll go look for the car keys. You do what you want. Makes me want to throw up... Always the same. I've had it. Would you look at that! "Inferno at Film Shoot" - Deep down they are just like us. No beginning. No end. Only this moment exists for them. Do they know this? Do they remember how they got here? Do they communicate with each other? Are they trapped or free? Do they have a thousand thoughts? Or just one? Their last thought. - Who are you talking to? - Dieter? - Who else? - What are you carrying? Put that silly thing away! - I heard voices. Singular, my dear. Singular! You heard one voice, which was mine. I was talking to myself again. What else am I to do here? - Go downstairs. - What did you say? - I said... Go. Downstairs. I'm doing one final sweep here and then we'll finally drive to the hotel. Is that clear? - Alright, Dieter. As you wish. Stop! Halt, this is private property! Halt! - Margot? Open up, it's me, Dieter! Margot! What were you doing with that candle? - Dieter, what made us so toxic? - Don't know... We're so far apart. Was it always like this? - Only this one last project. Then we'll take a break. Take some time off. Just the two of us. - Or did it happen over time? - Let's go travel together, Margot. - The sun is almost setting. - Then let's finally go back to the hotel. We'll have champagne. What do you say? Hmm? We'll have a relaxing evening. - I don't want to leave. - Sweetie... Be sensible. - We could make this our home. There's so much space. Children could play here. I didn't mean it like that. - How else did you mean it? - I just thought, now that we have this castle... - Does it bring you so much joy to humiliate me? - Stop it, Dieter! - No, I've had it! It's emasculating enough that I have to rely on your family for money, but now you hide away somewhere to secretly fondle yourself! What am I to you? - A loser! You're a good-for-nothing. A leech! I don't need you. Nobody needs you! I'm keeping the castle. - - You can't do anything yourself. Oh, are you feeling sick? Goodbye, Dieter. - That's disgusting! And who's supposed to clean this up? You want me to clean this up for you? You pig! You filthy pig! I hate you! I hate you, get out! Leave! You can't even do that! You wimp. You've completely sucked me dry! All of my energy! My whole life! Get out! Get out! Leave! Have you gone completely insane? - Stop it! I'm serious! - You're not taking that away from me! - Stop it! - You'll never get rid of me. I'll be with you for eternity. - Dieter! Darling! - Margot? Honey pie? - I'm upstairs. - Good evening and good night, Margot's gonna die tonight. Make no fuss. Don't try to fight. You can scream all you like! Come on up, Dieter! - Then Dieter comes for you. And there's nothing you can do! Early tomorrow, if I get my will. You'll be forever stiff and still. One more time for old time's sake? - One more time for old time's sake. - Well? - Yes... Yes, yes, yes! Copy it! - Alright, guys. That's a wrap! - That was fantastic, Lilith! That's exactly what I wanted. You got it! Super! - The maestro at work, right? - Mm-hmm. - You can count yourself lucky. With such a genius... When Gregor first told me about this film, he said, "Klaus, you were born for this part!" Then I read the script and the rest is history. But I still don't get the ending. - It's about the fear personified by your character's impotence. - Yeah, yeah, impotence, I get that part. But why is she a vampire at the end? - Well, she sucks him dry. Robs his energy, like he did her. - Oooh, that's good. "She sucks me dry." Literally. So symbolic. Did you write that part? - Nope. - Ah, that's from Gregor. Of course! Genius! How does he come up with this stuff? Ah, isn't life beautiful? - I personally think the ending is a bit contrived. I had some other ideas about the ending... Well, it's too late now anyway. - Yeah, yeah, fantastic... Bernd, you little rascal! How was I? By the way, great job. Couldn't have done it without you. - No. No. No. - Eva! - In St. Moritz? - St. Moritz? That was a legendary shoot! - That "Heimatfilm"? That was amazing! - And that wrap party we had? With the main actress... The freaky one... - What was her name again? - Romy! - Romy! - Klaus, I do have one more question. - Sock it to me! - You're always so smooth with the ladies. - Ah, you little charmer! - What's your secret? Seriously, tell me. - Wouldn't you like to know... - So, did you enjoy the shoot? Working with us lunatics? - And such an intense shoot. - I didn't think it was that intense. It was a fun experience. I could feel the "peace & love" vibes on set. Gregor did a great job. Working with him is so inspiring! He made me do stuff I didn't know I was capable of. - Everything worked out fine, didn't it? - Well, we did have some problems. - Which you managed to fix, as always. - Gregor, we still need to plan those outside shots we didn't get. - Relax. "Today is today and tomorrow is tomorrow." - And I was thinking about the ending... - Can we please discuss this another time? There are so many nicer things we could be talking about. I was thinking that we could travel together. Just the two of us. What do you think? - I think that would be groovy. It feels like we haven't really had much time together lately. - Really? But we just spent three weeks together on set. - Sandwich, go check who's at the door. - Why don't you go check the door? Bit of exercise might do you good, you lard-ass! - Are we expecting anyone? - Sandwich, be a dear and check downstairs. Sandwich? - "Helter Skelter." - "Death... stands in darkness and silence. And the devil... plays violin under the high court." - Stop! Not a step further. Who are you? What do you want? - Guys, don't just sit there! Do something! - Sorry, man. They made me do it. If you knew how long we planned this! - This was all a prank? You pig! You filthy pig! Ha-ha-ha, very funny! - Alright, guys, these are our new guests! Make some space. - Gregor, why didn't you tell me you were bringing guests? - Bernd asked me, and I said sure. - We've finished shooting. - Everyone knew but me? - No, no. Klaus didn't know either. Come on, don't be a buzzkill. We're just having fun. It's nice. - It's not about that! We have the castle until tomorrow. If something happens now I am responsible for the damage. - I'll see to it, that we all behave. Right, guys? We'll all behave, right? Alright, now party, party, party! Here's to me. Cheers! - Some wine? - No, thanks. - I wanted to thank you. - Me? Why is that? - It was very refreshing not playing the role I usually play. The promiscuous mistress that gets punished in the end. - Punished? By whom? - Usually by the wife. Or by society. She always ends up alone. - Well, not this time. The only one who can punish you is yourself. - I agree. And loving someone should never be punished. - Gather round, people! I know I can count myself very lucky having you all in my inner circle. Old friends. And new ones. They're shooting at us. They call us "good for nothing." "Leeches"! But we will never stop. They want us to join them... Consumerism. Capitalism. But the truth is, they are afraid. Afraid of change. Afraid of freedom. Afraid of us! Those that don't share their fears. They want to stay slaves. Because they don't know any better. But us? We won't bow down. We'll create a new society. One without boundaries. But for this, we must support each other. Believe in ourselves! Especially then, when no one else will! To see yourself in everybody and everything. Because in the end, we're all a part of the Great Source. And everything is a spiral going upwards. Together, we created something beautiful. Something that nobody, nobody can take away from us! Let this be our final night in darkness! Yes! Yes. Guys, I want that we all go home tomorrow knowing that we've made our mark on history. We've become immortal! Immortal! Yeah? So... Brothers! Sisters! Take it. Take it, and share it. And enjoy the journey. Sandwich! Bernd. Marion. And Gregor Grause. - Bernd? - Yes? - Be a dear and bring me some sparkling wine. - Yes. - That's kind of you. Where is Eva? - Probably went to bed already. This isn't really her crowd. - How long have you been a couple? - An eternity. You guys are cute together. - So now I'm cute? - No. You are cute together. You are... - Yes? What am I? - Unfathomable. - "Unfathomable." I like that. - And what am I to you? - Give me a moment. - Oh, take your time. - I think you're very... accommodating. - "Accommodating"? - Blah, blah, blah. Forget it. So, is there a man in your life? - I have men all over the world. I don't really believe in having just one partner. Love is far too beautiful to be shared with just one person. Don't you think? - Possibly. - Anything else would just be egotistical. - Whoa, whoa, whoa... - How are you feeling? - Fabulous. I just need to rest a bit. - I think I'll go dance a bit. Then I'll see you later. - Whoo! - She's into you. - I'm the director. Of course she's nice to me. - Man, if not tonight, then when? Take a look around. You are the king. The genius. The great Gregor Grause! You can do whatever you want. - We'll see. I'm not sure about anything anymore, Klaus. - The movie will be amazing. A perfect masterpiece. - I don't know. We'll see. - Where are you going? Where did everybody go? - Are you asleep? - I'm too exhausted to sleep. - Tomorrow we'll finally leave this place. - Finally. This shoot feels like an eternity. - An eternity? In this castle. - You're still tripping a bit. - I'm seeing things differently. - I can tell. - Gregor? Everything alright? Gregor? Hmm? - It's not good. The movie isn't good. The ending... It doesn't fit. - Now you notice? Gregor, I've been trying to tell you this for weeks. I think we should have focused more on the relationship between Dieter and Margot. - So, you also think it's bad? Hmm? So, I'm a loser? - No, no no no. - You think I'm a loser? - No! All I'm saying is that we should have shifted our focus. But if we change the ending, then everything will work out. - You think I'm some kind of idiot? You don't even believe in this film! - Of course I believe in this film! And I believe in you. Otherwise I wouldn't be here! Gregor. The movie will be great. You're doing a great job. - Gregor, everyone loves you. They'll love you even more, once the movie gets released. You're great. I love you. I love you. - You're so beautiful. Try not to think about it. Tomorrow everything will be different. - Tomorrow everything will be different... - Gregor? Hello? Hello! Can anybody hear me? - Eva? I'm sorry, okay? Eva? Eva? That you always have to be so fucking dramatic! Eva! - Eva! And the fire? - Nobody noticed until it was too late. Like every time. - Eva! So, did we all? - Yes. - How long do you think we've been here? - I don't know. - But if you had to guess? Two weeks? Or five months? Or a hundred years? It's funny, isn't it? - What is? - How the mortals perceive time. One minute follows the next. - Sometimes it still feels like that. - It's absurd, right? Tick... Tock... Tick... Tock... Tick... Tock... Tick... Tock... Tick... Tock... Tick... Tock... Tick... Tock... Loving somebody should never be punished. - Today is today and tomorrow is tomorrow. Tomorrow everything will be different. The only one who can punish you is yourself. - Stop it! - I didn't mean it... - It repeats as many times as necessary until you learn. - I can't believe we managed to get this castle. Shooting here the next three weeks... That will be legendary! When is Bernd coming with the equipment? Bernd arrives at 12 am. We start building the set at 1pm. Dinner at 6 p.m., and we start shooting at 9:30 p.m. - I have a good feeling. Looking forward to it. You, too? What are you writing? - Only small changes. Except the ending. I don't think she should forgive him like that. - Of course she should! That's what the story is about. Love survives everything. - But not like this. I mean, what does he learn from all this? Nothing. And she only comes across as weak, and she's not weak. Now nothing he does has any consequences for him! - Not true. He goes after her. He shows remorse. He's only human after all. - And how does she know he won't make the same mistake again? - He won't. Because he learned what a great woman he has at his side. - And she learned what an idiot she has at her side. Why should she even take him back? Because he shows her that he has really changed this time. That he really loves her. And she knows that deep down, he's an intelligent, great guy. Who loves her more than anything. Just like she still loves him. A little slip-up like this only shows what's really important. That she can forgive him, makes her strong, dignified, sensible. So... How did you change the ending? - If everything you can imagine exists somewhere, is every story you make up true somewhere?
