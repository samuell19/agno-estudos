I treat you as my son! I want to work in town. Go all the way to England, you can do nothing. Except washing dishes in Chinatown. You can't compare with them, my brother is lazy bone. Don't say anything good words for him. We brought you up, only asking you to help in the family. After I came back and help you for two years already. Alright, if you like just let him go. And don't come back again. Auntie, I didn't say I want to move out. Doesn't matter, you are an adult. You can support yourself and leave us behind. You go and find a job, I can manage by myself.

Ah Wing. Come over! What's the matter? You are sleeping and he is gambling, what are you two doing? Mr. Chow, we have nothing to do. I have a lot of complaints about your attitudes. Ask them to park their cars somewhere else then. You are hopeless, change the uniform with Ah Man. Manager, the captain is looking for you. OK, Ah Man will show you what you should do. Thanks, Mr. Chow. Where can I change the uniform. What can I do now? The most important is keeping the key in good order. And have a clear mind and fast action. No need to count the tips, just put it here. Why? The clients are so stingy, they won't give a big tips. That's it. A Rolls Royce, how come he hasn't had a driver? May be he doesn't like that. It's better to drive it himself. Ah Man, let me part it. Ok, park it in the car park. Be careful. Alright. Having dinner, sir? He is simply a car enthusiast. What are you doing? You are looking the way. Start the engine. What are you doing? Sorry. - Are you new comer? - I'll leave a minute. Get away now. You are not riding a horse. He is so rough. What are we going to do?

He looks like not knowing to drive. He had a bump and crashed the bumper. And don't even bother. Mind your own business. The client will notice. He is not your client. What is his name? He is the big brother when he is rich and dummy when he is broke. He'll even steal the governor's car when he is the mood. Don't bother too much. You've to be smart working here. Being the big brother? Being a dummy. Ah Man, nice magazine. Who has spare money to lend me? And I will give back to you very soon. OK. Thanks, I haven't seen you before. Today is my first date here.

I want to buy you and Auntie a nice house. I know the house with iron bar all around. Secure. That will be the Hotel Prison. Do you want to put us to the jail for the rest of our life? Listen to me, you gotta to believe the fortunes wheel! Easy come easy go, if you want to be rich. You should use your brain and work hard. You can't just sit and wait for the money.
