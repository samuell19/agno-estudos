Look, it's an emergency. Beth, are you there? I guess not. Look, I know you told me not to call you, but somebody stole my damn wallet. Look, I'm sorry. I just--i didn't mean to-- [beep] Waitress: Coffee? Yeah. Unless you got a 31-cent dinner special. Coffee's 50 cents. Uh... Look, married is one thing, denis. That's bad enough. But pregnant? That's another. [With French accent] Listen, Eva. I'm sorry I didn't mention this baby business sooner, you know, but it changes nothing between US. Yes, it does. Mm-mm. No, Eva, no. What difference does it make to you if my wife is pregnant or not, huh? That's my car! She's stealing my car! Oh, I'm sorry, man. I didn't know. This is absurd! Bitch! She leaves me in the middle of fucking nowhere?! I have an audition to prepare for! Oh, you're an actor? Yes, of course. Dennis brabant? [With French accent] No. Denee brabant. Oh. Denee brabant. You know, I think I seen you in something. I'm Zac cross. Oh, now it's too late to call L.A. no, no. Keep it. Waitress: Well, about the nearest motel in these parts is back at El centro, but that's odey bigbey's. Nah, he'd be too tanked up to answer the night bell by now. You mean there is nothing around here? There's my place upstairs, over the kitchen. Hey, Dennis, you headed to L.A.? Uh, of course. Well, listen, I'm moving to L.A. from New York, and you're welcome to come with me. It's just the only thing is I'm a little short on gas money. Oh, this is no problem. Here. Thanks very much. Oh, this is perfect. Um, could I have a 6-pack? No, no. Make it 2. Yeah. What's the matter with you? Have a drink. I've had 4. You've had none. I don't drink. You don't drink? Oh, you should have warned me about this before I agreed to ride with you. I gave it up. Ah, yes. A.A. I am familiar with this cult. I'm doing the 12 steps right now. That is the first step towards giving up on life. What has possessed you? Look, I wasn't really a nice guy on booze, ok? So? Be a bad guy on booze. This is a constitutional freedom in this country. I am sure of it. It is a woman who has told you this. Am I right? Am I right? I thought so. My friend, you must never listen to women. They fall in love with you not because of what you are, but because of what they want to turn you into. I don't want to talk about it, ok? I had a really tough week. Tough week, tough night-- this could be a recurring theme with you. What happened tonight, hmm? You lost all your money? Yeah. A hooker ripped me off. Oh! Ha ha! Look, I didn't know she was a hooker, ok? I mean, she was beautiful and delicate. She could have only been, like, 16 years old. Don't tell me this. A child whore? My god, where is this woman? Calexico. Oh, my god, what luck! I can't believe it. Turn the car around at once. I never paid for a woman in my life, ok? I don't believe in that shit. This is all the more reason! Listen, I have bought women all over the world-- beautiful girls-- believe me, clean. You know, it's the best relationship you can have with a woman. Of course. No stupid scenes, no commitment, no brioche and coffee in the morning, and you know, in the long run, it's cheaper. Get out of here. Oh, let's go back. I do a deal with you. You got nowhere to stay in L.A. You drive me back, I put you up free, huh? Till you find your own place. Deal? All right, look. I'll take you back there, all right, but I don't want to buy any women, ok? You can do whatever the hell you want to do. Agreed. I buy 2 fucks for myself. Ha ha! [Mexican music playing] Man: Ok, who's got my keys? We're closed, buddy. Denis: Yes, of course. Just a quick beer and a Brandy and a pack of camels... Ooh, like a gazelle, no? Hey, Mr. Navigator, what's wrong with you? You drove north. You were supposed to drive south. Don't look now, but little Annie oakley and her siamese twins are getting off work. Shh! Hi, Beth. It's Zac. Listen, I know you don't want to talk to me, but I need to talk to you. I have to report my stolen credit cards, and I don't have the numbers. Eva, listen to me. Are you crazy? I have an audition. If I miss it, I'm going to report you for stealing the car, you understand? I'm telling you, kid, those two, they are very interested. Do you mind? Look, I regret what I did. I do what I have to do, and I apologize for nothing! But I totally stopped drinking. And now I'm going to get roaring drunk and forget I ever met you! Kid, I'm telling you, they're going. Hey, man, I'm trying to leave a message for my girlfriend. Don't be stupid. Beth, Beth, are you listening? Why you fuck up this kid, huh? Get out of his life and let him live, ok? Ok. Voila. I can't believe you did that. I'm telling you, trust me. It's the only way to handle the situation. Ok, I'm going now, but I tell you, if I don't hear from you-- why do you take this crap, huh? Why don't you forget about this guy? Get somebody who cares about you, somebody who respects you, and dump this creep. You know, I hate to spoil this wonderful moment for you, but that was really stupid advice. Why's that? Because anyone who shows any respect for Eva, she just walks all over this person. Hello. Que Paso? [Speaking Spanish] Zac: I know you're home today. [Bartender speaking Spanish] Zac: I'm not going to stop calling you until you talk to me. [Speaking Spanish] Thank you much. All righty. Who the hell was this guy? He's a cop. Border patrol? No. Mexican cop-- judicial. What's he doing on this side? He's looking for a guy they call "the surgeon." A cabron. What's that? A bad guy. Hmm. You know, we could still catch up with those 2 cowgirls, huh? Take a drive down to this place salton city... Do a little breaststroking. Huh? Listen, Dennis. D-Denee. I got to level with you, man. Last night, I pulled off in calexico on purpose. See, it's my girlfriend in New York... Actually, she's my ex-girlfriend. We broke up. I don't know, man. I've been going through this thing about women. I just--i just want to keep my distance right now. Ah, no, no, no. This is exactly the wrong idea. You know what you must do now? What? What you must do now is go out and fuck absolutely everybody. I don't think so, man. I really-- I screwed up. Just, I don't want to get involved right now, you know? Who says anything about getting involved? I'm just talking about going out and banging numerous bitches. This is good for you. Listen, there's only 2 things in life that matter, huh? One is the green, and the other is the pink. Huh? Now, the more of this you've got... The more of this you get. But this is the interesting quandary of man's existence because the more of this you get, the less of this you've got. Ha ha ha! It's true! Ha ha ha! You're sick, you know that? But seriously, didn't you ever love somebody? I mean, even you. Not even once in your whole life? Yes, once perhaps, when I was your age. What happened? I fucked her mother, and she found out. Ha ha! You're an asshole. Oh, what's the matter with you? What are you, some kind of depressive poof? Denis: You know, you and your sensitivity towards women, you know, is beginning to make me feel like shit. What's that? What? There. We've got to pull over. No, don't do that. No, there's probably some fat-farm, dude-rehab ranch thing somewhere around here. I know. I'm just coming from one of these places. You're what? What are you doing? They might need help. What's wrong with you? Ohh... You have water? I've got some ice in the car. Please. You seem to know your way around here. I come through every year for the work, no? In the orchards. You know, these people are illegals. We can't drive around with them. It's a serious crime. We can't just leave them here. That girl might need help. Look, I have a problem. I'm also illegal. My visa is expired. If the immigration people-- if they pull US over, I'm fucked. What do you want to do? Dump the girl on the side of the road? Make sure we get you to your audition? Senorita carne prima. You know, you're right. I'm beginning to feel like a good samaritan. I must get her food, compa. I think there's a store further back. No. Too many people. I know where we can go, no? Zac: Hey! Where are we going, man? Man: Aqui. We're here. Man: It's ok. They think maybe you are la migra-- immigration. Sit down. The cook, she's from the mission. The food is free for the pickers. The drinks they must pay for. I'm Zac, and this is Dennis. [With French accent] Denee. I am astor. This is my sister Nadia. Nadia. We are from Sinaloa. My, uh, my sister-- she only speaks Spanish. Do you speak Spanish? No. Pequeno. Poco. I'm sorry. Do I understand what? No, I say, um... Would you buy US a little to eat if it's not too much? Oh, no. Sure. Dennis, you have the money. Uh, excuse me. My sister, she has, uh... How do you say, uh... Allergies? Yes, allergies, si. Hey, what kind of meat is this? Oh, what are you, one of these insufferable vegetarians? Ha ha! [Crushes cigarette under foot] What do they want? He say 2 white fat asses like you shouldn't be in here, dirtying up the seats. Ah, ah. This is one of those differences of opinion that is never resolved by argument, so shall we leave? [Astor laughs] What's he saying? He said for bringing you here, he should kill the 3 of US and rape my sister. Sister? Denis: What did you do to this guy? He's ok. I just stick him here. This man, he was a coyote,no? A smuggler for migrant workers. He say me and my sister owe him money for bringing US to the other side, but they do a bad job. They lead US right to la migra, and my sister and I, we are pulled apart from our family. It's lucky I have this armador,no? Police radio: 186-16. Officer Hernandez reports suspicious activity in parking lot. [Woman speaking Spanish] Man: Woman: Hey, rawley. No need for the feds, Sam. This one is going back across in a bag. If it were up to you, there would never be a need for the feds. Yeah, they'd all go across in bags, and I appreciate the backup, too. Rawley: There he is. Yeah, he about emptied out enough blood for 3 fat men. [Fly buzzing] This guy is no fence-jumper. Them boots is a dead giveaway. 300 bucks right there. Drug runner-- maybe. What did he get it with? Well, it done a good, clean job, whatever it was. Any witnesses? Well, the cook claims that she did not see the fight. She said that a Mexican couple and 2 gavachosdid it. 2 white guys? What would they be doing here? What do white guys usually do when they're hiding near the border? I'm only border patrol. Someone ought to start employment sanctions against this place. Yeah, sure, if you want to get your ass transferred out of here quicker than shit. This is a company town, Sam. Big agriculture owns it. Always did, always will. Who the hell is that? Whoa. Looks like a border patrol job, Sam. Excuse me. Are you a citizen of the United States? Can I see some form of I.D., please? This is a crime scene-- only police allowed. I am police. I am comandante de federal judicial policia mexicana. What happened over here? Someone got killed. Stabbed? I'm still going to have to ask you to leave, sir. Only u.S. Authorities have jurisdiction here. I'm sure you understand. I understand nothing about the laws of this country, especially when they are applied to Mexicans. Well, take it from me, senor, right now you're violating one. Rawley: Problem? I'm only looking for a relative, unofficially. Unofficially. Your relative documented? Do documented workers break their backs in the orchards for $20 a day? Saragosa. Where you from? Uh-huh. How about you? You're from here, no? Yes, I'm from here. Cheap Mexican retread. He better do something about that soon. It's all arranged. One room in your name, one in mine. Zac: Great. I hope they got an ice machine. Ohh. Zac: I'm ok. Ow. Easy. Ow. Ow, ow, ow. Ow. Would you like a drink? Why not? You know what I say? There is only birth, death... And many hangovers in between. No hermana? No...soy... La...hermana. You're not--you're not the hermana. You're not the sister. No. Yo no soy elsister de astor. Um, the girlfriend? Um...gosh. Amigagirl de astor? Well, that's good. Um... I'll be your amigo. Si? So... Our little friend is feeling better, no? She's good, eh? Nadia--she knows what to do. We'll let you sleep, compa. You know, it's like costarring in some fucking weird movie with these 2 people. She just told me that she's not his sister. Would you claim a relationship with that lunatic? Listen, we wait till they fall asleep, then--ffft!-- we get the fuck out of here! No, I'm serious. I mean, why would she say that? It's clear. She wants a green card, and she's prepared to fuck you for it. Well, that's stupid. That doesn't make any sense. What difference would being his sister have to do with that? Come on, Zac. You question their reasoning? These are crazy, wetback types. They pay $1,000 just to cross the border into the u.S., and then they work for $1.00 a bushel picking your breakfast juice. You know something? You're a racist bastard. No, no, mon ami,no. I am an educated bastard. You Americans, you live next-door to these people. You know nothing about them. You ignore them as if they don't even exist unless they are mowing your lawn or pouring your drinks. Look, it doesn't make any difference, ok? Something's not right. I don't think we should ditch her. [Humming] Are you looking for me or for my sister? Uh... Uh, you, astor, actually. Uh, you see, I have a-- an appointment in Los Angeles, and, uh, Zac and I, we will be leaving early, so it's possible we don't see you in the morning. Oh... I see. My sister, she will be disappointed if she does not see you before you go, huh? Astor... Nadia tell Zac that she is not your sister. And how do you think, huh? I think she probably is not. Caray. I see I cannot hide anything from you, huh? Then she's not your sister? No. Who is she? She's just a whore, hermano. A whore? Si.i met her in mexicali. She had been whoring to make money to come across with her family, no? So you are the, uh, coyote,am I right? You are too clever for me. Si,i am the coyote. Her family, they cheated me. Yes. They were supposed to pay me once more when I get them across, but they said no, they have no money, and so now this coyote from the orchard-- he's with the mafiosos, the coyote-- he wants his money from me, so I take the girl and bring her to scorpion spring to meet the family. They pay me the money, or she must work the debt off. So you mean... Maybe you would like her, huh? She's young. Her skin is pretty, clean. It's good, huh? Well... How much? For you? Wait here. Come here. Get them drunk. Get them shelling out their pay on these bitches, que no? And let them know there's money for anybody with information on the cirujano. Go on. If we get him before he makes the drop house, there's going to be tripastew. I'd like to try some of that stew, cuate. Let's you and me go inside, have a drink. Come on. Muevete. I went shopping for you, amigo. See? Ah, so you know about that tehuacanazo. Like drowning in fire, que no? Now, my friend... I need you to tell me exactly where El cirujano'sgoing. Mm-hmm. Ha ha ha! No, no, no, no, no, my friend. You talk too soon. Makes me think that maybe you'll tell me a little lie. Uh-uh. So... I have to make sure that you do not even have the will to lie. You understand, hmm? [Man screaming] Zac: Where have you been? Ha ha ha! What's so funny? You. Ha ha ha! Why am I funny? Because that girl that you're so worried about, she's the biggest whore in mexicali. Ha ha ha! Who said that? Astor. He's, um... He's what you call a coyote. He smuggled her across the border, and, uh, she didn't pay him, so he cannot pay his end of the action to the other coyote in the orchard, so he's holding on to her, so she can fuck away the debt. Ha ha ha! I tell you, Zac, it's incredible. It's like a movie. That girl's not a whore, Dennis. Oh, you had trouble believing that about the other girl, too. I'm telling you, this girl's not a whore. I'm telling you, she is. I'm sorry to be the one to disillusion you, my friend. Yeah, well, how the hell do you know? How the hell do I know? Because they charged me 200 bucks! Ha ha ha! Can you believe that? 200 bucks? She would have to fuck 20 men in mexicali to make that kind of money. 200 bucks! Jesus! Ha ha ha! You telling me you fucked her? Of course I fucked her. What should I do, take a Spanish lesson? Ha ha ha! You're an asshole. Yeah. Ha ha ha! Shut up. I said shut up! What's the matter with you? What, do you think she's an animal? What, do you think I don't know what's going on? You want to fuck her as well, huh? But you're too politically correct to admit that you are jealous. Well, go ahead! Do it! I'll pay for you. You disgust me! She's poor and desperate, and you have everything! Wait, wait, wait, wait. They ripped meoff. 200 bucks. [Knock on door] Shh. [Whispering] That's probably astor. Oh, shit. It's a cop. Good. Turn them in. Are you crazy? You want to go to jail? I told you transporting illegals was a serious crime. You must hide under the bed. No. What for? Because look at you. They may be looking for 2 white guys from the orchard. You must hide, please. Morning. Bonjour. Sorry to disturb you, but the office was closed. Is this your vehicle here? Yes...no. No. It--it belongs to my friend, but he's hiking, so he left me, abandoned me here, so I'm alone for the moment. Which direction are you headed? Uh, east. We are coming from Los Angeles. Have you seen anyone else in any of these units? No. No. I've not seen anybody the entire time I've been here. It's-- it's the desert. Deserted. Police radio: Simon? Simon, this is rawley. Simon. This is Simon. Go ahead. Yeah. You better get down to the dunes pronto. We got 3 more bodies. I'm on it, rawley. Officer? Uh, i--I'm just being curious, but is everything all right? You keep your doors locked, don't pick up any hitchhikers, you'll be fine. It sounds very serious. No. A wet got stabbed to death over in salton city. Have a nice day. [Starts engine] No, listen. We go now, quickly. You killed that guy. Who? The coyote in the orchard. I just stab him here. Maybe it's somebody different, no? If I stab you here, will that kill you? Perhaps. Coyotesdie all the time, but you see, I don't give a shit about coyotes. Maybe they kill him. Hmm? Or maybe this dead body is somebody else, no? Entiendes?we go now. Listen, why don't you just--just take the car? In the car! Iandale! Sam: Hey, rawley. Heard the radio dispatch. Uh-huh. Well, it's the same weapon as back at the orchard, only not as clean a job this time. Looks like a coyote and 2 pollos. Doesn't make sense. Migrant workers don't get killed on this side of the border, only when they get ripped off trying to leave Mexico. Whoever took out that stiff with the fancy boots took out these boys, too. I don't know about this guy, but these two are farm boys. Who needs money more than 2 poor farm boys? Hell, Sam, this farming valley is second only to Florida for drug smuggling. You border patrol boys better stick to your dogcatching. These are not dogs! Jesus, Sam, don't go getting que viva Mexico on me. All I'm saying is that these 2 wets may be running drugs, and if they are, then that's my business. It's not yours. You got an I.D. On these guys? Can I see it, please? "Gavrillo portola." Mm-hmm. I'm running a check on all these boys. Did that cook at the orchard say if she got a good look at the girl? I see you're taking those 12 steps backwards now. Salut! Where are we going? A dry lake. There. Scorpion spring. It's in the middle of fucking nowhere. Zac: There's not even an access road. Don't worry, compa. I know the way. Hey, look, you can't take this car off-road. It won't make it. It's ok. It's not ok. Look, pull the car over. I'll drive. What are you doing? I said pull the car over. I'm driving. What? I think maybe you should rest a little longer, yes? Tell this asshole not to push the car. It'll overheat. It had radiator trouble 2 days ago. Fucking coyote. I told you to slow down. There's a vulcanizadora maybe one mile. Come on. Push, you lazy bastard. I am pushing! I have a bad back, you know. Astor: Come on! I am tired of coming on! Boy: How you doing? Howdy. Lem Wells. What seems to be the problem? Oh, man. It's overheating. I had the same problem the other day, but I just let it cool down for a little while, and it was ok. Now it won't turn over. Wells: Uh-huh. Looks like a black hole under this hood, my friend. Let me see here. Yep. Frozed up. You boys must have been getting things mighty hot. No. So, where you fellows headed, anyway? Well... We are just sightseeing. Ah, is that a fact? I think you knocked out the thermostat. I got to get off that old hose to get it off. Going to have to charge you for a new one, though. Yes. Go ahead. Yep. One thing you don't want to do in the desert, my friend, is get overheated. Fellows like you can end up in a lot of trouble. Don't take much, neither. It can get real rough down here. Hand me that blade, will you? Yep. I seen fellows come here from L.A. one night. They get lost down there. They ain't coming back, neither. Sheriff finds them months later all dried up like cornhusks. You could hear them from way off... Shh. That's what's wrong with this damn thing-- piece of shit is rusted shut. You fellows better hope like hell I got another one around here that'll fit. Elsewise, you could be waiting till tomorrow till I get one in from escondido. Where the hell you been? See if you can find them one of these thermostats around here. That looks like it hurts. Yeah, it does. Why don't you come into the other room, and I'll give you some ice for it? No. It's all right. Thanks. Wells: What the hell you talking about? Wells: Uh-huh. There's no need to get snappy. I found one already. Yep, you fellows are in luck. Now all we got to do is put a new hose on that mother. Shouldn't take too long. If we can find everything we need, that is. Wells: Yes, sir. You ought to put all new hoses on here, my friend. They're all about just dry-rotted. You're looking at more bad news down the road. I'm sorry, hermano. We don't have any ice in there. That's ok. I could have told you that. I don't know why you offered it in the first place. Maybe you could put the can against it, like that. It's cold. You mind if I just drink it? No. No, go ahead. Wells: All right. That'll do it. Now why don't you get in, see if it'll fire? You will drive. No, I drive. I will ride in the front. Wells: Uh-huh. He's driving now. How much do we owe you there, then? I don't know. Why don't you give me 2o bucks? Thanks. I appreciate it. Yeah. Don't mention it. [Car starts] Wells: There goes bad news on wheels, boy. I forget something, compa. Wait here, no? Oh, man. What the fuck? [Whispers] Go! Go! Look, we can't ditch her here. She needs him to help her find her family. Listen, that fucking lunatic, he killed the coyote in the orchard. Go! The cop told me. He killed him? Yes. Now let's get out of here, please! Get the bitch out of here! Wells: Yeah. This is Lem Wells over on s-3. Uh-huh. How are you? Listen, we had US a little visit here a minute ago that was kind of peculiar. Yeah. There were these 3 fellows-- um, hold on. Woman: What did they look like-- [connection breaks] Damn. Cut off. [Footsteps] What's the matter with you? She's just trying to find her family. Enough! You do not know what you play here, gavacho. Entiendes? Entiendes? [Starts engine] Howdy, rawley. Jo. Where's Sam? He's on a call. Take a seat. They're putting in a new sizzler down there by the interstate. Well, it's just getting real civilized around here, ain't it? Yeah. Sam. Rawley. I just thought I'd drop by and see how you federal folks are saving US all from the dark tide crossing the cactus curtain and all that. Well, I was just on my way out. Yeah, well, I'd like to talk to you for a minute if you don't mind. Sure. What's on your mind? I spoke to the cook. You went out there to see her on your own, didn't you? Yes, I did, and I think I know who's out there. Look, I know who it is, all right? Astor zapateco-- coyote drug runner, likes to stick folks in the neck with a screwdriver, likes his friends to call him El cirujano. El cirujano. It means "the surgeon." Because he's so neat and so precise in what he does. This isn't about a bunch of wets looking to pick grapefruit, you understand me? We've got US a real pancho villa here. That's where you're wrong. This guy is a cholo. All his activity is gang-related-- rivals, not innocent people, and this thing about the screwdriver-- we get it all the time-- screwdrivers, ice picks, scissors... We have all the wire reports on file. Look, I know all about your report. 3 days before El cirujano crossed the border, he was being sought for the murder of an old woman in mexicali. Did you know that? So? So the old woman was the mother of the comandante of the mexicali judiciales-- the guy we met at the orchard! Rawley, I'll back you up. I'm the fucking sheriff of imperial county. This falls under my jurisdiction, you understand? Not yours and not the comandante. But I'm going after that judicial son of a bitch because he is going to lead me to the surgeon. Those farm boys don't fit your drug angle, rawley. That's all I'm saying. Sam... I appreciate all your help. I really do, but it really doesn't matter why they was killed, now does it? Look, I know what they're going to say-- 2 more bad seed from south of the border, Gustavo and Gabriel portola, killed on a drug deal went sour, but that's not the way it happened. Sam, I've always appreciated the way you've kept everything in perspective, but you're letting the job get to you. You're listening to the Mexican inside you. It's a tough job. You send some kid across the border, he comes back, all in the same afternoon, all because he wants to bust his ass for less than the minimum wage, and there ain't no solution because you can't open the borders and you can't build up no Berlin wall, either, but if this El cirujanofuck gets into Mexico, he just going to come over here again, and we ain't going to know it because there ain't going to be any u.S. Criminal record to track him with, and his next victim is going to be some big shit orchard owner whose tax dollars is footing the social services for your fucking fruit-pickers. Then let's see how much sympathy you wets get then, huh? What did you say? "You wets"? I didn't say shit, all right? You calling me a wetback? Listen, Sam, old son, if I was going to call you a wetback, I'd have done that a long time ago. Jo: Freeze! Get off him, rawley! [Cough] Why are you waiting, Jo? Shoot the bastard! Ha ha ha! [Starts engine] What was that about? I don't know. I don't know. Look, Sam, I'm sorry, but cirujano'shit again out at Lem well's place. Lem well's? Yeah. It just came over the dispatch. Rawley's going to get the call again any minute. Damn it. Astor: Ay,the road. Zac: That's not a road, man. That's the road to the dry lake, hermano, to scorpion spring. Perhaps it's one of those invisible roads, you know, like a coyotetrack. Hey, you know what? I've had enough of the insights to the life of the coyote right now, all right? So I'm not taking my fucking car over that, so you can get out. I think you should get in the car and drive, compa. I like you. Nadia! She doesn't like gueros. Motherfucker! But if you wish to die today, it's as good a day as any. Astor! Zac: Son of a bitch! Denis: Would you like some mescal? I've had enough. Yes. I hear this before. Woman: ♪ there's an a-bomb ♪ ♪ h-bomb ♪ ♪ aids-bomb ♪ ♪ everyone please remain calm ♪ ♪ win a kilo and a box of Pandoras ♪ ♪ or choke on an order of mequiadoras♪ ♪ the u.S. Is bordering on depression ♪ ♪ keep those peasants guessing ♪ ♪ wrong numbers ♪ ♪ once a week... ♪ Denis: What is this place? We go past. Ique la chingada! Pull up to the houses. Zac: At your service. Woman: ♪ america tripping ♪ ♪ america tripping ♪ They're going to kill US. No. If so, why not yesterday? No. It's much better out here. There's nobody around here for miles. Listen, my friend, this time tomorrow, we'll be in L.A. Eating supper, drinking wine, fucking. You can phone your girlfriend, tell her what a hero you've been. She'll fall in love with you and beg you to come back. Big happy ending. Hollywood. No. I, uh... I doubt it, man. I, uh, I lied to you. I, uh... I didn't fuck around on Beth. It was her. She had the affair. You know, perhaps you expect too much from women. You shouldn't. They're all the same. You turn them over, they all look the same. What is it? It's from Nadia. The kid at the gas station wrote it for her. She wants me to know that she doesn't want to be left alone with astor and that, uh, nothing happened between you and her. Is that right? She's a liar. Well, she's lying, or you're lying. Which is it? Hmm? I hate to tell you, Zac, but of course I screwed her. She was standing naked in front of me. What was I supposed to do, the Mexican hat dance? Look, it doesn't matter what happened or what didn't happen. She needs help. Sam: Simon. We got him. Fingerprints is all over this thing. Lem: If you're going to be stealing my knife, you better bring me a new one. Hey, Lem. Everybody all right? Hell, yeah. He just tied US up and covered US with that tarp there. Funny thing was, though, that son of a bitch come back about an hour later, and he don't say or do nothin'. You're saying he came back after he tied you up? I reckon so. Who else would come in here and walk around the garage and not say shit? Where's sheriff Gill? Came and went already. Shit. Lem, what in hell are you looking for, boy? Goddamn it, Simon. I lost my goddamn cigarette case, goddamn it. You ain't done picked it up, now, have you, octavio? Octavio: I ain't seen your cigarette case, Lem. Lem: I'll tell you what happened... [Voices continue indistinctly] [Faint police radio] What is it? What's wrong with her? It must be something she ate, compa. Hey, help me get her inside. She needs some water, compa, from the cooler. [Nadia groaning] She's sick. Hey, I'm talking to you. Ooh la la. Oh, merde. Comandante: Iel cirujano! Aah! Zac: Nadia. Nadia. [Shouting in Spanish] [Gunshot] Hey... What happened? Denis. Ay...ay. Come on. Get up. Get up. Come on. You have to get up. Get her back to the house now. Who was that? An old friend from the other side. Like your friend from the orchard? Si.like him. Also dead soon. Like all of US, no? Yeah, well, I guess that's up to you, huh? You think I'm a killer, no? Pues es verdad, compa. I have killed... When I must, when they're trying to kill me, like in the orchard, eh? Entiendes? If you was in my position, you would have done exactly as I have done. Like back there when you hit me in the coronillas-- that is enough to kill a man for. You're very lucky, for the moment has passed. Yes. What has happened is between US. [Nadia cries out] [Groaning] Kind of across the line, ain't you? Iay! Looks like you found your boy. Where is he? Well, let's get something clear here. You got your badge, and I got mine, but he's come into my county, so he belongs to me. You think I come to arrest him? I come to kill him. No, no, no. That ain't gonna happen. Now, you can either talk to the feds and tell them how you're pursuing a suspect across an international border, or you can tell me where he's gone, and I'll cut you a little slack. Scorpion spring. Thank you, comandante, and I promise you, I'll save a little piece of him for you, something to put in your wallet. Sheriff, please. Help me to my truck. At least help me to my truck, please. [Groaning loudly] It's tough about your mama... But you'd best clear out of here now. [Coughing] Sheriff: Hey, you all right? Sam: Rawley... El cirujano... I know where he's going. I'm going to radio this in, and then you and me gonna have a talk. Sorry, cuate. Give me the gun, very slowly. You can't drive in this condition. I know. That's why you drive in my truck. The gun. 2 fingers. Ha ha! You look at me like I'm dirty, cuate. Huh? The corrupt judicial,no? I think you watched too many gringo movies. Let's go. Ah, bonjour. I hope you had a nice rest while you leave me to sleep outside like a dog. I can't believe you. Where's Nadia? You're asking me? I'm the one who slept in the fucking ditch, remember? Thank god they've gone and left the car, so we can go. Zac, what are you doing? [Sigh] [Coughing] [Speaking Spanish] Zac: What the hell are you doing? [Cocks gun] Nadia and me-- we had a deal, compa. She must bring the cocaall the way to scorpion spring, since she's the one who fucked everything up. Nadia... Well, now she says she doesn't want to carry it, so I must force her to keep her promise. Nadia... Denis: Zac! Wait! Jump. El cirujano. Are you going to let this cabronget away? I wonder who the cabronis here. We're losing time here, cuate. Youare losing time. Get up. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Yes, it is scorpion spring. Look. There is something over there. Yeah, look. See? There's some abandoned ranch houses or something up there. We'll find them. I can't believe we made it. Denis: There is no one near this place. Zac: One quick look, and we're out of here. [Tape playing Mexican music] Gabriel! Gustavo! Gabriel! Nadia, if they're not here, I'll help you find them. Gustavo! Denis: If you find them-- yes, well, very good. While you're at it, why don't you find a locksmith, too? My god, I can't believe this. Nadia! Wait, amigo, amigo. I'm just helping her look for her family. Really? Well, I'm looking for somebody, too, somebody I think you know-- El cirujano. Come on in. Join US. Zac: I-I don't know El cirujano. You don't know El cirujano? That's funny because I already know about you guys... From the orchard. Look, we had nothing to do with that, ok? We were just trying to help. Just tell US where her family is, and we'll pay you, and we will leave. Why don't you shut the fuck up and don't bullshit me, huh? I'm here for one reason. I want to know where El cirujanois because he has my coke and I want my coke. Denis: There is coke? Zac, we are driving around all this fucking time, and there is coke? Ha ha! Who the fuck is this? Where are you from, boy-- funny boy? I-I'm from France. From France. What the fuck is a frenchman doing out in the middle of the goddamn desert? Well, to be honest with you, I was drying out in a rehab clinic in Arizona-- shut the fuck up, all right? Goddamn. How about you? Where you from, boy? I'm, uh... I'm American. [Other man laughs] I'm going to ask you again, all right? Where you from? I'm--I'm American. I asked him twice. I asked him twice. Didn't I ask him twice? [Zac groaning, Nadia crying] Goddamn it, Arturo, you got a short wick. Goddamn it. That was real ethnocentristical of you. You should have said north American. Goddamn. I asked you twice. Now, Arturo here, he hates that shit. Sam: Stay right where you are! Don't move! You--release the girl. Put the gun down slowly. Comandante,step in and identify these men. None of these men is El cirujano. Close shot. Not really. I didn't give much of a shit about who I hit. I only told El cirujanothat she was a whore because he challenged my arrest. You dog. I'm beginning to get the picture, my friend. Oh, I bet you'd like that, huh? No! I don't want to hurt our business. I have the rest of the Coca safely in mexicali, but I want the girl. I understand that. But I'm afraid that's bad luck for you on both wishes, comandante. El cirujano. El rojo. You, amigo, you've made some very bad business for US in mexicali with your little screwdriver trick. You've heard what the son of a bitch has done? I've heard what you have done. I did not kill his mother. I sent someone to his house to get him, but the old woman was screaming. This boy was scared, so he stop her screaming the way I teach him. I did not want this. Well, seems this whole thing's been one big misunderstanding, huh? So now that we got that off our chest, let's talk about the fuckin' cocaine, huh? I got a third out, which you must pay me for. The rest, I will go back and bring across for you, but you must find another judicialto work with because this one I kill. Whoa, whoa, whoa, are you stupid, huh? Huh? You got it backwards, amigo. You got it backwards. There's dozens of cheap cholosaround, but a comandante is not so easy to come by. I sent my guys to settle this shit with you at the orchard, cool things down, but now we got the cops. We got the cops right here in the drop house. Hell, we've got the whole operation in one room. The left hand and the right hand are not supposed to come together. Got that? You got a job to do: Get the shit across, and you got a job to do: That's look the other way. The 2 of you should not even know the other exists. But instead, some stupid fuckin' blood feud between you 2 titty babies over some bitch has really fucked things up. El rojo: Shut the fuck up, would you two? Goddamn! I don't give a rat's ass whose sister she is, who fucked her how many times, or where they did it. I want to know one thing: Where are my kilos? Comprendes? With her. She's the mule. You are the mother of my babies? I knew I liked you. How do I know you got them? Are you going to shit them out for me, or am I going to have to perform a little caesarean? No joking. Oh, I'm not joking. I'll cut this bitch open from cunt to Adam's apple if she's carrying. Or better yet-- I'll watch you do it. You're El cirujano, right? Astor: Nadia. No! No, no, no. Please. Please. Don't-- don't shoot me, please, now that everything seems to be going so well for me. Sam: Imuchacha! [Sirens approaching] Zac: Nadia... Wait. Zac: Nadia, wait. Are you ok? Stay down. Simon: Sam. Did you get to rawley? Picked him up a few hours ago. I'm sorry, Sam. Wasn't there a girl in this group? Run a check on that guy over there: French actor, denis brabant or something. He says he was hitchhiking. He doesn't know anything about anything. I met that guy at the motel. Actor, huh? I'll give him a ride back. I-I'm very grateful for this ride, officer. It's all right, Mr. Barbant. I got to run a quick check on you, though, so I'll need to see some identification, like your passport or visa. Ha ha ha! Oh, shit.
