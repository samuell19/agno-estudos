HOLLAND. LATE 20th CENTURY 1st May. All the tables on the beach were booked By bribery, we got a table... ...only a kilometer from the official stand An excellent position to view the manoeuvres... ...of the Netherlands Soviet Republic... ...Democratic Federal Burgundy... ...and the Socialist United States of Ireland I saw Narcisso for the first time Look, he's got a better table than us He must be an official guest We're official guests, too He must be a guest of Workers' Philips That doesn't make him better than us I expected the worst I didn't know the day would be so surprising He wouldn't come to our table... ...so I decided to go to him Wonderful, isn't it? - What will you speak? - French My favourite language. A pity no one uses it I don't speak Dutch ON TOP OF THE WHALE A FILM ABOUT SURVIVAL I have a house just like on this postcard In Patagonia Isn't it wonderful? Just the same house as my grandparents' This was a coincidence That morning Eva had told me her dream She had returned to her grandfather's home... ...with me and a strange man who was her husband Even stranger, in fact we had planned a visit... ...to her grandfather's house, now a monument... ...after the Democratic Evangelicals' chairman... ...(the Dutch Communists) had stayed a night there Madam says you are an anthropologist What is your specialization? Collective telepathy... ...among primitive tribes in South America... ...and Workers' Philips staff - Does it exist? - Certainly It's bad? As a sociologist, I cannot make value judgments Sociometry identifies... ...four interlinked phenomena: the prophetic dreams of Indian tribes... ...weekend delirium of Workers' Philips staff... ...increased drug trafficking... ...and Leninist literature as a best-seller Very interesting Haven't you had contact with Indians? I spent four years with the Caonize Indians In my house in Patagonia... ...live the last two surviving Yachanes Indians My kid From then on we were inseparable We met daily in Haarlem at Hotel Malcolm X... ...or May Heroes Beach, or in nightclubs... ...named after Bloody Week in The Hague ...extinct in 1970 The last two? Are you sure they are Yachanes? Yes, I am certain, they are like family to me May I kiss him? Freely We eventually accepted the invitation... ...of Narcisso Cambos, communist millionaire Scenario and direction Don Narcisso What a mess here You should lock up the house Look at this mess, bastard I can't take it any more, do you hear me? Don't you understand what I say? Your shoes will get filthy in that shit Then your mother will be angry It's called The Gobbling Cat All he does is find everything amusing I knew you would say that I knew you would say you knew I know everything that's going to be said Anthropologist Don't look I'm going to stand up now... ...and look at them The moment I saw Eva, I said: "You're the man for her" I love her very much I really love her Why? Do you fancy her? You're jealous. Extremely jealous Nothing wrong with that. I am never jealous My God, not more suffering You mustn't confuse appearance with reality The relationship between myself and Eva... ...is more complicated than it appears I love her dearly... ...but in a completely negative way Eva is the opposite... ...of the woman I find most hateful So I love her I know. I envy you My God, the Virgin again She saved my life She saved me from the abyss I had plunged into She helps me find my work again She saved my life I have a cassette. Would you like to hear it? Paprika They are here Good evening These friends of mine have come to visit you "Good evening". How do you say that? What has your boss brought for you? A present If he eats that, he'll get Patagonian colic What do you say? Thank you Very good. You are very intelligent It takes intellectual labor... Sit down In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. Amen Good idea. Rather late, but very interesting Incredible. He doesn't trust anyone Ask why Indians must be beaten Ask him in English He's much more interesting than the Indians More dangerous But also more loyal You have to know him, then you realise I hope you know he's very dangerous Yes, but very loyal A pathological case He hasn't a clue 3rd April. Slept badly. Fighting in the night What is this? And this? Narcisso, I won't be a minute And what's this? Come on, it's nice outside We'll eat, so please leave that now To get to know them well, you mustn't go on too long But I must question them But you mustn't tire them out All right, never mind Ours... ...see the others... ...reincarnation, hunger, war, rain, summer... Walk in bad weather, freighter, dog... ...what others think of you... ...rock on your head if you insult an elder Beating a child to death on a rock Eclipse of the sun and moon, stars Sea, earth, mother... ...Republic of Chile, Argentina, canned fruit... ...son, dog, song sung by others Fatal conflict between two tribes, death... ...Puntanela hospital, river stones... ...light of the moon Sea of whales... ...woman, fire-water, sun, deaf... ...artillery fire Menstruation, walking with no sense of direction... ...thirst, endless... ...god of the mountain, raw meat Evenings alone Strong emotion at sunset Sheep... ...question and answer game... ...explanation of the meaning of life, violin Thirty glasses of fire-water in the morning A thirty-year hangover Stop it Hand me that My tongue... Dug, but found no trace of the many skeletons... ...Narcisso says are buried around the house Found many beer bottles, 3 radios, rabbit skulls The dictionary comprises sixty words... ...as does the Wilkins dictionary Both are in exactly the same order 7th April. Mistake; the skulls are not ritual... ...but rabbit stew has cannibal cult links 1st May. Workers' Day Early meditation on the Chicago martyrs Afternoon: reading from "State and Revolution" Evening: political talk. We fast until Monday Please go away 3rd May. Slept badly, due to an air-raid Adam and Eden have buried all our mirrors Luis lashed them, then all three of them cried Thomas Bridge's 300,000 word dictionary... ...is derived from 60 root words; metaphors... ...double and triple metaphors Don't go too close, they may be dangerous, strange Are proletarians always strange? Too much exploitation has made them strange The pain has turned them insane Do all proletarians of the world unite... ...because the pain has made them insane? No, that's something else Quiet, I understand - What did you do? - I don't now - In which language? - I don't know 5th May. Woken by whispering at 3 a.m. I heard a baby cry, then Adam and Eden laughed Now I understand everything The 60 Yagan words are an arithmetical system They add, subtract, multiply and divide... ...according to rules which clarify everything Shut up! I'll cut that tongue out now if you don't shut up 7th May. Each month Adam and Eden exchange names 9th May. Good They are telepathic, like Narcisso, I think So what? The terrible truth: one human exploits another Alphonso Alberquerque's commentaries... ...made Adam and Eden laugh incessantly 12th May. They continued taking photos... ...each having a different name Today's rain hasn't the same name as yesterday's There is no water, or fire, no whips... ...only situations, all different 14th May Double, triple metaphors are no coincidence They mean the intuition of 2 and 3 as spoken They are incapable of more modern thought... ...because conception of the singular eludes them They are convinced that 1 is an even number... ...so regression is infinite 20th May. They bury the mirrors again 21st May. Naval battle: Chile versus Argentina Heavy shelling at night 23rd May Every word or saying tacitly contains others Tacit metaphors speak between spoken metaphors Ignorant chatterboxes: silence means more said 24th May. I opened my heart to Eden I spoke German, so he wouldn't understand He placed my hand on his heart, speaking Italian: "Every heartbeat has a name" 27th May Every day they construct a different language... ...a Gothic cathedral Dreamt up at night, forgotten by morning Proof that too much culture... ...leads to barbarism and hinders development 2nd June. The world is contained in 60 words Each implies the whole in its own perspective Denying singularity, two things are said at once Each double reflection of the world... ...implies 59 second degree reflections The intelligent become increasingly silent 25th June. Illusion The Indians' language is non-existent I found the documents today They are recessives, not pure Indians Nothing they do or say has meaning The whole world deceives me I deserve a holiday in Romania And Eva has decided she doesn't love me I shall not return Things change sex in the mirror All things are divided into sexes So are all movements. This is male This is female The bet is over Not with the kitchen knife please don't cut out your tongue I must tell you something My life has changed... ...since that disastrous bet I discover a friend in you... ...and myself here When traveling, I always wonder: who am I? Where do I come from? Where is my fatherland? I was searching, but you found a new world for me I had violent tendencies, but a child's heart But now I am determined... ...to give up everything and write But not in Spanish I was always cynical. I laughed at everyone But now I feel responsible... ...for this country, these Indians in Patagonia... ...massacred by our ancestors In this novel I want to write about who I am... ...who you are... ...as homage to this noble race... ...which has seen so much bloodshed... ...that Patagonia resembled a battlefield It is delightful to meet the world's finest people People of the world The loneliness in this hole... ...would be unbearable Loneliness... unbearable Your visit today is deeply moving Deeply... visit Your visit moves my soul Soul... moves The daily conversations made apparent... A final judgment of the people will reveal... Mozart was a genius... ...but it came too easily to him His good fortune was his weakness Mozart was reactionary Beethoven revolutionary, because he showed... ...the desperate petit bourgeoisie But his music offered no way out But Beethoven sells more records Beethoven is played by musicians... ...closer to the people I have returned Eva and Narcisso have changed drastically The suicide of Luis must have shocked them deeply I forget everything when I set foot in the house Hours later I'll return to my hotel I can still view, review, hear, rehearse ...the images and words I no longer comprehend Greetings, friends How are you? Well? You have traveled widely You know Spinoza... ...who left Spain for Holland He had good ideas. What happened to them? You have been to Germany. You know Hegel A good man You have learned much How did you learn so many languages? You have a good memory What will you do with what I know... ...and what you said? What more than all those others we talked about? I am leaving
