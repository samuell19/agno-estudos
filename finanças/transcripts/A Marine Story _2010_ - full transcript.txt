- Hi. - Hi. So when did Frank's close down? Oh, two years, three years ago. - Oh? - Yeah. Is it OK if I stow this here while I shop? Uh, yeah, go ahead, honey. Can I get a pack of smokes? Um... sure. What kind do you want? What do those say right there? These are lights. What are those ones, those ones down there... Just those blue ones there. These are menthol flavored. The other ones there, to the right. $6.24 with tax. Um... You know what... I forgot my money at home. I'm gonna have to come back. Call 911! I will break this arm. I will break it! Hold still... Hold still! That boy is just swirlin' down the drain. Seems like they all are. Didn't have meth labs around when we were that age. Things don't always change for the better, I guess. No, they don't. I don't remember it being your job to do something about it. I wasn't looking for trouble, Max. That's not the way he tells it. Look, four deployments would make Gandhi trigger-happy, so I get you might be high-strung. But stand down, soldier. You gotta leave this stuff to me. I know, it was stupid, it won't happen again. You've got a more important fight. I'd give you a lift, but I'm a little short-handed. It's fine. - How long you in town? - Couple of weeks. Good. Say hi to the General when you speak to him. I will. Hey, Max. There was a girl. - Tall, brown hair? - Yeah. You carry any tequila? Not open yet. Holy crap! Is that an Everett? Hi, Shelly. Alexandra Everett, what the hell you doin' home? Don't you know there's a war on? How's your dad and your brother? Everybody still got all their pieces? Yeah, so far. We pray for that, yes, we do. You're lookin' marvelous as ever. Thanks. You, too. Oh, please. Marines aren't supposed to lie. Let me buy you a drink. No, thanks. I just stopped by to say hi and use the head. OK, you know where it is. You on foot? I can give you a ride to the house. No, thanks. I need to walk off that train ride. Ten miles ain't a walk, honey. That's a hike. Three new messages... Alexandra, hi, this is Tracy Flores from San Lucas Realty. Could you please call me back and just confirm that you are there and that I shouldn't book the house? Thanks. Alex, it's your father. Been trying to reach you on your cell, with no luck. The realtor said something about you staying at the house. If you are, call me. Hey, Alex, it's Joe. Just heard the news. Wow.. And we had a choice of our own - either take the word of a madman or take action to defend America and the world. Faced with that choice, I will defend America every time. It's generally believed there's been a let up in the violence of late in Iraq - that is until today... The car bomb ripped through the mostly Shiite area of North Baghdad, called Al Haria. The car, parked next to a bus stop at rush hour... The explosion in the mainly Shiite area engulfed shops and residential flats, causing chaos and confusion amidst the busy streets... The meth lab explosion in a Bear Valley home last night has left one person dead and another with severe burns. It's the third meth lab explosion this year... Hey! You bought this? She's still got some life in her. I see you put the flag up. An Everett is home. For now. Take a look in my back seat. Her name is Saffron - Saffron Snow. - You remember the Snows? - Yeah. You heard about the accident? Drunk driver ran a red light. Killed both her parents and her brother, but somehow she walked away, which is a friggin' miracle. This is her grandmother. Mrs. Snow. Alexandra, you remember me? Of course. You were friends with my mother. I haven't seen you since she passed. She'd be so proud of you. She had such plans for this place. So look... I was wondering if you could help us out. That stunt the other day was pretty much the last one for Saffron. The judge gave her a choice: go into the military or go to jail. With those friends she keeps, I'm afraid she'd choose going to jail. She's old enough we're not talking Juvee, either. She's got to the end of the month to get her act together and make a good impression on a recruiter, or else. We thought if you'd just have a few words with her, get her motivated. - I'm no recruiter, Max. - I know. But she's a good kid, Alex. Please... She's stopped listening to me. I just don't know what else to do. All right. Better get her out of that car before she cooks. Great. Thank you, thank you. I know you know how she must feel. Now you listen to that lady, you understand? Hey, Max, just leave her here. I'll run her back home later. There's water over there if you need it. You learn how to do that in the Army? Marine Corps. Ain't you supposed to give me some sort of pep talk about the military or something? I don't think so. Uh, OK. Why not? Your grandma said you don't listen much anymore... I don't think I'll waste my breath until I now I've got your full attention. I'm sorry, you say somethin'? I'll tell you what. Come back here tomorrow morning, on your own, and I'll help you out If you're interested. OK. Whatever. You got another car? Nope. But you said you'd drop me back! Oh, you heard that, did you? All right, then can I use your phone? Use your legs. I live like five miles from here! Shouldn't take you too long then. You know I didn't steal anything! You saw me, you know I didn't! I was just there! March back here tomorrow morning, early, without that stud in your nose, and we'll talk. Fuck you! Our message to the commanders in the field and to our leadership is that, based on our current deployment model, the troop levels associated with the surge cannot be sustained indefinitely. That said, I have heard... Here's your Pentagon Channel Report... Diplomatic commitments from Iran to help stabilize and improve the security situation in Iraq remain unfulfilled. That's according to Major General... Everybody offered me a lift but you. Looks like you need the exercise. Hey, girl. Get him another one, would you? I'll have the same. Will we be startin' a tab then? Yeah, why not. So what else is going on? You seen Holly? I think she's livin' up in Fresno now, but I haven't spoken to her since she went off to college and you went off to get the tattoo. Wow... That's been a while then. Strange how you just lose track of people. At least I see the flag up once in a while. That's a reminder. I should have stopped by to say hello a lot sooner. I'm sorry. Ah... You got married. I did too. You didn't miss much. So... When do you go back? I am planning my next move... I got my honorable discharge. I thought they weren't lettin' anyone out. They are. Yeah, but I thought you were in for life - family tradition and all. Listen, if it has anything to do with your marriage to what's-his-name... If he comes around here, I'm gonna knock him down for ya. He's a Navy SEAL, Leo. Be a friggin' walrus, I'll still knock him down. He's not comin' around. So you're out... What next? Exactly. We'll have to find something fun for you to do then. Leo, I- Hold that thought. - Boys! - Leo! Get down here. Somebody I want you to meet. All right, guys, let's go. To the troops! To the troops! - Ah! - Yeah! How would you even know there's a war on? They ain't raised taxes, they lowered 'em. Don't you read the bumper stickers? Yeah, and those yellow ribbons. Those help. So you lady Marines all really Semper Fi and shit? We're just called Marines. But you still do all that secretarial work, right? They fly jets, idiot, helicopters. The only thing they don't do is ground combat, but that's gonna change. Combat? No fuckin' way. No offense, honey. Try not to be a prick. What Turk is saying, in his graceful manner- Very graceful. ...the difference between men and women- A gun is a great equalizer. Yeah, yeah, but some jobs men are just better at, because of the muscle mass. Muscle mass, Stenny! It's not that women aren't part of the team, there's just the strength issue. He's right. There's that saying that the strongest woman is equal to the weakest man. What? It's true, so if we're talking about combat- What did you just say? I didn't saying anything, I'm just- You just said that the strongest woman is equal to the weakest man? Yeah. I'd take that bet. Dale, arm-wrestle her. - Yeah, buddy! - Yeah! I'm not the weakest. You want to go round robin on this? Cut to the chase. You're it. Woo! Come on! It'll be like a little science experiment. You got her, buddy. Come on, baby, make me proud. A good clean fight... No kicking, no biting, Dale. I got 20 on Alex. I got that bet. Good. Put your money on the table. - Here we go. - Ready? One, two, wrestle. Come on! Put her down! What the hell?! What happened? Well, we put that theory to rest, boys. Yeah, wait, wait! I get shot, she can't carry me off the field. I can't carry you off the field. All right, let's test this with a real man. A lefty! All right, hold on, hold on. You know what, guys? I think we proved the point. - Alex, my compliments. - Thank you. - I'm buying. - That's my money. Cool! The front line is just about anywhere you drive a HumVee, so women are in combat every day. But you can relax. It's not gonna be official policy any time soon. I had a buddy who was a Marine, and the women Marines... well, all the other grunts called them W.M.'s. Waste of money. - That's what he said. - Jesus, Turk. He's really not our friend. - That's what he said. - It's all right. We have an all-volunteer military that's stretched pretty thin and they'll take pretty much anyone they can get, so I'd say if you're not gonna join up, you can shut the fuck up. Well, she's got you there, bud. What'd I miss? Where are you going? There's your difference right there, boys... Bladder the size of an acorn. How's that? He just decked her! She shoved me! What's goin' on? All right, darlin', that's enough. They hand out balls to the lady Marines, too? Everybody calm the hell down! - Turk, stay away from her! - Screw that, I'm tired of this toy soldier bullshit! I said back off! Jesus! Just chill out! Go sit down. Now you can hit me. I said, sit down! I'm callin' the police! Turk! Hey, Turk! God! Sorry, Mom. What I'm about to say is extremely confusing to me, and I'm sure will come as a shock. You're being investigated for conduct unbecoming an officer. What? Specifically, homosexual conduct. That's absurd. Emails describing the nature of a relationship have been discovered. Sir, I have sent no emails. You received them - on a military email account. Junk mail, immediately deleted. - Apparently there's other evidence. - What evidence? That'll come out in the hearing. I'm just informing you that the process is in motion. But who put the process in motion? It doesn't matter. Sir, I have the right to know my accuser. Doesn't work that way, Alex. Look, hopefully we can clear this up when the board of inquiry is convened. But you should know, if they do find against you, you might end up with something worse than an honorable discharge, which you'd still get if you decide to separate before the hearing. So, just keep that in mind. Sir, with respect, this whole thing is ridiculous. I'm married. Yes, I know. It doesn't matter. What am I doing?! Dammit. God dammit. Anybody in there? Hello? Hey, Marine lady! You better be home after making me walk all this way. Did you walk? Or am I gonna find your car at the bottom of the hill? I walked! OK... Let's see if you're lying. OK, so I drove. I was gonna be late. All right, now you get to clean all the crap off the driveway from here to wherever your car is. Yeah, right. Listen, I'm here, OK? So just give me some talk or whatever. Talk is cheap, but it ain't free. Oh, my God... You're insane. No, I just know that talk ain't gonna work on a meth head with an attitude problem. I am not a meth head. Look, you're gonna wash out of bootcamp your very first day and end up in a prison cell, or worse. I can get you ready, but I told you I'm not gonna waste my time. So either give me total submission or get gone. There's a rake and garbage bags in the garage. What a major bitch. Punk. I got you water. Saffron? And breathe, ladies. Extend through the fingertips, lift the back thigh up, opening the hips and breathe. Strong pose, fire pose. Find some water in the pose, find some flexibility in the pose... Somebody smile, somebody smile... Extend and... reverse crescent and up over, reversing the palm.. and looking up... Breathe. Hold the position. The crazy thing is, I didn't realize until after I enlisted. At that point you kinda keep it to yourself if you like your job... I loved my job. God, I feel like we should go get a drink or something... I've got to go teach. I gotta head back anyway. I just thought I was gonna lose it if I didn't tell somebody the truth. You can keep it a secret, right? Yeah, yeah. What about your family? No, they don't need to know. Not while my brother's deployed. Not while my father's still alive. Leo? This needs to stay between us, OK? Of course. You know, I always thought you had a little crush on me in high school. Uh uh... Oh! Your crush on Leo didn't do you much good, either. No thanks to you. What a confused and frustrated little triangle that was. Yeah. Hey... You've got your ring on the wrong hand. Is that some kind of code? No... I just broke this finger. It won't fit anymore. Does your husband know? I'm just here to pay for the damages. It's been taken care of. Leo? What's he drinkin'? You rack. I get a little dizzy bending over. Garbage! Garbage... is gold! You ain't got a shot now. Hey! You forfeit the game that way. Shooting willy nilly is silly. Fine. Forfeit then. We don't train to shoot half-cocked. Half-crocked, you mean. You're fully crocked. I can't do it. I won't. So, I'm going home. And I'm not even gonna drive, because that's just a bigger bullet. I salute that wise decision. As you were. Hang a right out the door and keep walking until you see your mailbox. Night, Turk! W.M... stands for Walkin' Marine! Ooo-rah! I used to drive a Chevrolet... Now I'm walkin' everyday... I used to drive a Cadillac... Now I'm humpin' with my pack... If I die in a combat zone... Box me up and ship me home! Close Combat Instructor, Drill Sergeant, Amphibious Warfare School graduate... Top marks all around. And a Mustang to boot. Just so we're clear, I don't see how you being a lesbian makes a damn bit of difference. I am not a lesbian. And I didn't just ask you if you were. I'm just following the assumption. We fight side by side with the British and they let the gays in so, believe me, I know how stupid this is. Yes, sir. Certainly you've had to deal with this issue in your command, haven't you? I had two men tell me they were in love with each other right after September 11th. How did you handle it? I told them to kiss. They couldn't. And you left it there? They were just afraid of what was coming. They got over it. So they stayed in the fight. See, that's the issue, right there. If a homosexual is allowed to stay in the fight, maybe die in the fight, there's no way in hell some politician can tell 'em who they can or can't marry. You see what I mean? It's not a matter of unit cohesion or troop morale. It's about the damn marriage issue- Respectfully, I appreciate your insight, but I really, really don't care about this crap. At ease, Major. I just want to be free to do my job, sir. Now is not the time to be losing any Marine, that's certain. Is there a way to at least push this off until I'm eligible for my pension next year? I'll see if I can slow the wheels. I'd appreciate whatever you can do on my behalf, sir. Got your back. Dismissed. Corpsman up! Corpsman! You got a man down over here... Bone check. All good. Hotel, Echo, Lima, Papa! This is Devilfish 1-2 calling medevac. I'm hit! Anybody copy? I said I'm hit! Where is everybody? What a bender you're on. Well, come on in. The first thing you're gonna see when you get off the bus is a line of yellow footmarks. You put your feet on them. Stand at attention, like this. Eyes and head straight to the front. Don't look in my eyes. Look straight front. Do not ever make eye contact. It will be late in the evening. You will be tired and hungry and disoriented. And that's exactly the way they want you, because for the next few hours every manifestation of what you consider to be your identity will be stripped away. Your clothing, your hairstyle, your mannerisms, speech patterns, bad habits, everything. They get in your face and call you maggot even if you're a girl? Yes. - Show me. - No. Sheriff said you were a drill instructor once. Let's see it. No. Do it. Call me a maggot. You know you want to. Ever since you saw me you've had it out for me. So just do it. It's not like you haven't already been a major bitch anyway. I'm curious to see- Curious will get you killed, recruit! From now on, everything you need to know I will tell you! Everything you think you know, you will forget! Did I not just explain to you how to stand at attention? Shoulders back! How old are you, Snow? - Uh, 20. - Uh? Uh? We do not say 'uh' in the Marine Corps. Uh is something you hear from little lady meth-heads who sell their twats for a fix. You sell your twat for a fix, Snowblind? Uh, no- I mean no! You will answer me ma'am, yes ma'am. Do you understand me? - Ma'am, yes, ma'am. - Ma'am, yes, ma'am. Did it take you 20 years to get this stupid, Snowflake? - OK. - Hey! Did I tell you to step off your marks? Why are you not standing on your marks? Do you need your fix, Snowblind, or are you just ready to run home to grandma? All right, I get it, OK! Stop it, stop it! Holy shit! I am not a meth-head! I've never even tried it! I'm just being hard on you so you're not completely unprepared for boot camp. What I've been describing here is day one with the Marine Corps. The Marine Corps is the toughest, the elite. With you I think we try Air Force. Where you goin'? Aspirin. What's next, Major Bitch? That's not bad. Don't stop! You said a mile. Yeah, but we gotta time you for three. Keep goin'! Go, go, go! Move! Go! Come on, love it, do it... Just go until your body stops. Don't listen to your mind. Good. Come on, stay up there, stay. Come on, come on! Well, you didn't pass the minimum physical requirements, but you did better than I thought you would. Really? Rule number one... Never smile within sight of your drill Instructor. You have no right looking happy in boot camp. and if you do look happy, they'll remedy the situation. Used to be a beauty queen... Now I got my M-16... They're gonna hound you all day, make you make mistakes. You're gonna feel worthless sometimes, but that's the enemy you fight. You're not worthless, you're just learning. You OK? Get some rest, I'll see you tomorrow morning. - Leo. - Saff. What happened to your face? Managed to get hit with a razor this time. What are you doing with her? Little project. Well, I came over to offer another apology over the idiocy that happened the other night. This is the idiot maker. How 'bout some coffee? - If you say so. - C'mon. What? Just... memories. I got a shoebox full of those. C'mon. Hey, you wanna ride? No, thanks. Just go on. Don't slam the door. Food's on the counter. I spoke to your mother. She said don't worry, everyone is just fine. Said to make sure I told you that. Do you hear me? Yes. Saffron... Don't worry. Everyone is gonna be just fine. Help is comin'... Help is... There's no bikes in boot camp! Come on! My legs are toast! You will fall down, but you will get up. You will be pushed beyond your limits, but you will comply because you have no idea what your limits are. I'm at my limit. - Are you gonna puke? - No. Then you're nowhere near your limit. Come on, keep moving. Let's go! - I can't- - Can't? That's not a word. Seriously- Seriously, I will go full Drill Instructor on you. Oh, no, please don't. Then block the mind chatter. This is about willpower now. Are you listening? - Ears! - Open, ma'am. Then take your eyes, put them on the horizon and go there! Outstanding! You have been a zombie maggot your entire life, and now thanks to your country you're starting to wake up. - Say thank you! - Ma'am, thank you, ma'am. That's right! Ma'am, thank you, Ma'am. Don't let me get ahead of you. Stay in front of me or I will own this bike. This bike is mine! OK, I surrender. Can you swim? Captain of the swim team in high school. Maybe we'll ship you off to the Navy. So... You're friends with Leo? Yeah. Uh huh. Old boyfriend? High school. He shaved for you. Right. Is Burner your boyfriend? I guess he was. They're all just boys, you know. I don't know what they're doin' and I don't wanna take the time to figure it out. I just want a little squeeze here, a little massage there, a little exploration. Not all that jack-hammerin'! Is that too much to ask? Ahhh! And you brought civilization with you. How nice. - Should I open it? - Yes. Quickly. I'll get some glasses. You seem tense. What's up? I'm standing in your house... I got dressed up... I brought a gift. I hope you don't think I'm hitting on you. Are you? No... - Aww... - Oh, God, no. Am I? Girl, you're a hot mess. It's OK to cry. Marines don't cry; their eyeballs sweat. Is this a dance club? Can be. There aren't any men in here. I know... Every night is ladies night. - Someone might see us. - That's the whole idea. Let's go! You've never been in a gay bar before. Of course not. But you've mingled... with the ladies. Tequila! Whoa, sailor, relax. We're just here to meet a friend. I don't want to meet anybody. Let's just go. Relax. It's just someone I work with at the yoga studio. Oh! There she is. Then you became a what? A Deputy Provost Marshall. It's like a cop. Oh... Iraq is mostly about policing now. Seems like they had you doing a lot. A lot of opportunity there. You think? Two wars. I'm sorry. I gotta come right out and ask you something. What? Did you vote for George Bush? No. Good. There's really only one answer to that question. Actually, I don't vote for presidents. The Commander in Chief is the Commander in Chief. I find it's best not to get invested in outcomes. Is that answer still OK? Yes. You don't think Holly minded when we ditched her? No. And it didn't seem too obvious when we left together? Who cares? Mmm... You are hungry, aren't you? Where are you going? Alex, what's going on? Are you all right? It's just my roommate. Calm down. Come on, talk to me. Alex, come back to bed. - Sir. - Shut the door. When I said I had your back, I thought we understood each other. That's why your promotion was held up. The fact that your father retired with two stars probably kept anything else from happening. Sir, that person was a very close friend of mine. - Anybody can see that! - No, just a friend. I was shipping out the next morning, we were saying goodbye. You got caught, Alex. I was drunk. And that's what you're gonna tell the board of inquiry? Yes. OK... We'll say you were well hammered and taken advantage of, or some latent feelings were unlocked by the booze, but that you're straight. A bit confused, but straight. Yes, exactly. And those emails were a prank of some kind. Her fantasy, not mine. It would help if we had more proof. Proof, sir? The burden lies with you, Alex. Aside from my already being married, what exactly are we talking about here? Have you been faithful? Is there any man on base who can put this whole thing to rest? Adultery is also illegal, sir. How would that help me? Call it the lesser of two evils. Hey! Yeah, baby! Yeah! USA is number one! Hey, gorgeous... Wanna make some lunch money? Burner... You made bail. How about that? Thought you'd pitch in a buck. You didn't even come to visit. Yeah... Sorry. Where are you headed? Nowhere. Just around. I'm goin' that way. Hop in. I don't want any trouble. There's no trouble. Listen, I can't even be seen talking with you. I'm sorry. Cut her off! I must have been gone too long. Let me reintroduce myself. Hi. Whoaaa! That is way overdosin' on the Kool-Aid, yo. Don't say yo. Ma'am, yes, ma'am, but Jimmy. What happened to you? Nothin'. What did this? Tree branch. Tree branch with fingers? Think you can teach me some karate moves? Yeah. Wait. You leavin'? I don't know what I was doing. Pick that up. Put your hands on my shoulders. If someone's gonna grab your shoulders, first thing is you smack and grab here on the wrist... Put your arm on top of my arm. Yeah, that's it. If you're choking, the first thing is to turn your head so you can breathe... Put your hand down along this seam and fold it over... E-5, Sergeant; E-6, Staff Sergeant; E-7, Master Sergeant- No. E-7 is Gunnery Sergeant. Right. E-8, Master Sergeant and First Sergeant; E-9, Master Gunnery Sergeant and Sergeant Major... Give me 20 pushups. Oh, come on, all the way down. 57, 58, 59, 60... Yeah! Call me maggot now, bitch! Turn it, twist it, pop... I'll see you bright and early. Ma'am, yes, ma'am! So what's the deal with this house? Your dad doesn't seem to wanna live here... You don't wanna hang around. The General is happier in Florida with his cronies. And I'm not ready to settle down yet. Why don't you just sell it? My mom's ashes are here. - How many times have you gone? - Three. How many are you gonna do? One more than my body tells me I can. That was in the mailbox. Hey, don't wear your legs out! We're goin' to a party! It's a good idea you had. Thanks for goin' along with it. She's on my team. No arguments, birthday boy. I tried to invite Dale. I was hopin' we could make up and all be friends, but no one's seen him. Well, how about this for a replacement? Leo? Holly? Hey, you. Am I the only one gettin' older around here? - No. - You haven't changed a bit. Yes, she has. She never would have done something like this back in the day - our little granola girl. - What's up, Marine? - Hey! Ready to play? Green team get ready! Red team get ready! OK, everybody, don't bunch up, but always keep a teammate within eyesight. Let's paint these losers! Here we go... You might want to tuck your head down. Hey, beanpole. That came outta nowhere. Usually does. Get your hand up. That wasn't nice. Happy birthday, Leo. Hey, Stenny. Fuck! Stenny! I'm on your team! Oops! You're outta there! - Sorry, OK? - Fuck. That was quick. Friendly fire. Yellow... Looks like alien blood. Better than the red stuff. I don't know, you know... I mean, workin' out, makin' beds, gettin' yelled at - that's one thing. But killin' people, that's something else. I can't even get a spider out of the tub. The military is gonna train you to do lots of things. Non-killer stuff. I think there's only a week of rifle training in the Air Force. Still... I just don't think I have it in me. That impulse, or instinct, or whatever it is. Yeah, baby, eat paint! The green team is drunk drivers. The red team is your family... Alive. Damn! Bastard! I'm out! New game! Stenny, you head up the left flank. Everyone, if you stick in one spot too long you just broadcast your position. Turk? Turk?! Keep movin'... I got it. Let's go. Keep your head down and check your colors before you shoot. Don't shoot your teammate. Go, go! Yes. That's my girl. Saffron, keep moving! Move up! I'll cover you! Ow! Holly? That's for your next birthday, sunshine. Leo, you son of a bitch! Holly, we're on the same team! Get him! Try not to get paint everywhere! It's more like colored egg whites or something. Try not to get eggs everywhere. Stenny, which one is red? He can't tell you that. He's color blind, ain't you, Stenny? You shot me twice in the back! My aim just really sucks. Here you go. Wait, hold on. She's got a big day tomorrow. I'm taking her down to the recruiting station. - Excuse me? - It's time. You sure about that? Yep, you're strong enough now. Not quite as much of a punk as she used to be either. I don't know about that. Seriously, though... After everything you've been through, after all you've survived, that is saying a hell of a lot. To Saffron... I think you've already made a lot of people very proud. To Saffron! Hey, she's gotta have a beer now! Her eyeballs are sweating. Awwww... Girls are awesome. I'm gonna drop her at home. Save my chair for me. Gentlemen... Attention! Aw... At ease. I'll go with you, hold on. And leave Holly alone with this wolf pack? Mmmm... That girl was a train-wreck three weeks ago. Alex really shaped her up, didn't she? You shoulda married her, boss. It should be clear to all by now, Stenny, that I'm nowhere near worthy. Screw that. She never really liked you anyway. - True. - Thanks, Bill. Has anyone ever met her husband? Should I come in and talk to your grandma? No, she'll be way in her cups by now. I'll pick you up around ten then? I think I'll march up to your place. It'll help take the edge off. Just don't wear those clothes and everything will be fine. What if I'm not ready? They'll make you ready. That's their job. What if I don't make it? Well, as my mom used to say, "Failure ain't the falling down, it's the staying down." She died when I was around your age. I don't know if you knew that. I did. Heard she was a real beauty. She was. - Get some sleep. - I'll try. What the hell is this? I was waitin' around hoping you'd tell me. So... Tell me. Is all that true? What the fuck have you done? Come on. Flag's flyin'! We're home! Whoa! What's with all the carpeting? We'll take a tour tomorrow. Come on, you can sleep in Nicky's room. Nicky... How's he doing? He's giving 'em hell. I want to ask you abut Saffron. What? Why are you sending her away to them, after what they did to you? When somebody falls, somebody's gotta take their place. You didn't fall. I left them one short. Which one? C'mon, take those clothes off. They're filthy. I gotta pee. OK, c'mon, it's this way. Ahhh! What is it! You got shot. Oh, I thought I had measles... You're OK. Oooh, your neck... Yeah, I know. Let me see what you got. Damn, you're a leopard! Stenny fragged you good. He kissed my hand after you left. Leo? Yes. And now I kiss you. OK... Now everybody's happy... Everybody gets what they wanted. That's nice. - Come on. - Where you going? To bed. Oh, no. OK. Go to sleep. She late? Yeah. Why don't you go get her? No. Horse to water kind of thing? Basically. I think I drunk-dialed Leo last night. Uh, oh. And I offer a blanket mea culpa for any other stupidity that may have transpired. You didn't break anything. So, what's next for you? I gotta get a job. I was just short of my pension. God, those idiots. I wish ignorance was painful. Where are you? OK... Give me the address. I'll be there as soon as I can. By the airport? - Hi, Joe. - Hey. You wanna sit down? I, uh, pulled a few favors to get a flight routed through here. They actually gave me leave. Can you believe that? Just to come home and file for divorce. I could have done it. No... Something's up. I need to play this right. Go back to the base, raise a stink, file the papers. Let everybody see... I'm gonna have to put on a show, say some crappy things about you. I'm sorry. So... Tell me what happened. They had pictures. They were taken four years ago. The pictures were four years old? Yes. And they finally just got around to showing it to a review board? There were some harmless emails, too, recent ones - None that I sent. - Harmless? - Yes. You must have done somethin' else. Were you drinkin' again? No. Did you piss anybody off? Hit on the wrong girl? No. Maybe they were scrutinizing me because they caught wind of you. I wasn't with anyone the entire four years since those photos were taken. I knew it was getting risky, so I transferred to a new base, I severed all ties, and I have been immaculate, pristine, since. When you transferred, did you sleep around with any of the guys on the base? No. I thought marrying you covered that. Come on, that's no fail safe. You know you've got to feed the rumor mill. What about Pollard? He's not married. You could have broken a sweat on his back. I did. It didn't matter. He was just playing me. I'm sorry. It might not be worth it, Joe. It's got to be. Call me when you file the papers. I will. Be careful. Tequila, Shel. What? I'd like to say it's none of my business, except it was taped to the door of my business. And I have no idea who put it there. I run a business where judging people don't make a whole lot of sense. And? I don't think this is right. That girl is really screwed up enough as it is. OK, Shelly, thanks for everything. Say goodbye to the fellas for me. Calm down. No one's runnin' you out of town. - That should cover my tab. - Hey! Mind if we talk in your office, Shel? Go ahead. Somebody papered the town last night. I was able rip most of them down, I think. Got 'em in my truck. Oh, God... I know this is complete crap. I was here when this picture was taken, and nothing was going on. You can do anything with photos these days, manipulate 'em... But who would bother? This part is complete crap. Of course. This part is true. Since when? Since long after. Oh, man... That's funny. Wish you'd told me. I couldn't. So the million dollar question, of course, is... did I ruin things for you? No! Just a preference then? No. All right, let's just focus on who did this. I have no idea... But I really need to find Saffron. Mrs. Snow? Saffron? Saffron! Put that shit out! - Who is it? - Pizza. I want to talk to Saffron. Yeah, talk? That's it? Saffron. Go home! I'm fine! She don't wanna talk no more. Get her out here or I'll call the Sheriff. And say what? Whatever I need to to get him here. Look, I just want five minutes. Saffron, get out here! Tell her to go away! I'm talkin' to her. OK, we're marching out of here double time. Pull yourself together. There's no point. I went to the recruiter's office. They had the pictures. It's OK. I can take care of it. No, it's done! I can fix it- Listen, I'm not your toy soldier anymore! I'm not your girlfriend and you're not my mother, so just leave me alone. I'm your friend. And a soldier or sailor you can be. Well... I'm a meth head now, so... It's OK, come on. Come on... let's get out of here. Hey! Where do you think you're goin'?! You got her high, you son-of-a-bitch! Stop it! You're gonna regret those photos, I swear to God! You're being an idiot! Don't you get it?! They don't want me! They're gonna take a meth head instead of you? They're gonna take a worthless piece of shit like me instead of you? Saffron- Don't you understand I should be dead right now? I'm the last person who should have walked out of that car alive?! Dude, careful where you shoot that. You'll blow up the house. Tie her hands. Fuck this, man. We're outta here. I got this. OK? Bust into my house and toss me all around like that... Maybe I'll make the citizens arrest this time. Or maybe I just shoot you in self-defense. On the other hand, maybe you came here lookin' for somethin' else. You really screwed me in the store that day, you know that? Could it be you came by just to return the favor? Maybe you need to prove you're straight... Like Saff just did. You don't need pictures... 'cause I get it all on video. OK, maybe it's self-defense then! Burner! No! No! Why'd you fuckin' do that? Give me your cell phone. Give me your cell phone! I need two ambulances and fire response at 12 Stanton. Female, 20 years old, gunshot wound to the abdomen. Send HazMat, too. There's a meth lab here. It's not yellow. Help is coming, help is coming. It's OK. Anything we can do, just tell me. I can offer you that lift home. No, thanks. Come by the station tomorrow, if you're up to it. OK. It was good that you tried... Some of these kids are worth catching. Yeah. It's not your fault. It's gonna be OK. Thought you were takin' the day off. They're a little short-handed. What about the party? I'll be there. How you doin'? Are you happy? Sad? Are you pissed off? No, it's good. - Yeah? - Yeah. It just came a little late. Well, it's official, folks - the "Don'tAsk, Don't Tell" policy is history as the President just now signed into law a bill allowing gays to serve openly in the military. A lot of mixed reaction out there, which we will illustrate in song after this... - Freeze! - Stop! I got him! Get off me! Anything in your pockets gonna stick me? - Hi, Dale. - You're a cop?! Yeah, if I can't fight the War on Terror, there's always the War on Drugs! I'm arresting you for manufacturing crystal meth. Oh, and I'm also giving you a citation for a cracked sideview mirror. Nice pictures, by the way. Nice uniform. Same to you. Sorry I was late. I got a good story to tell you about my morning. - I got some stories for you, too. - I'll bet you do. 22-11 to county. All available units... Duty calls. I gotta march off that train ride anyway. Outstanding, Marine. I'll see you at your welcome home party tonight. - Don't be late. - M'am, yes, m'am. Mama, mama, can't you see... What the corps has done to me... 1, 2, 3, 4, United States Marine Corps!
