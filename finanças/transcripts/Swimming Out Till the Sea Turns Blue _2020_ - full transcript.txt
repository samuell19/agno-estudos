"One, Two, One" "Be united, alert..." "... earnest and lively" "Unite to win yet greater victories!" Back in 1949... Everyone called Jia Family Village a pit The place made people ill Alkaline soil and foul sewage There were just three treasured assets Sow thistles, willow shoots... ... and phragmites reeds Why were these assets? People could eat sow thistles They're an edible foodstuff That was one of them The reeds were also edible... They fed the livestock So these assets... ... were essentials for life in the village Nothing else would grow there It was desolate land We couldn't cultivate it The soil was too salty! I won't go into the history of it Let's jump ahead to when Ma Feng convened a meeting A general discussion That was the start of the big change One evening we talked with Ma Feng He asked us to gather twenty or so people Maybe thirty, people with skills Smart people with good memory To have a group discussion So we sent out a call And more than forty people showed up Ma Feng raised the issue of filtering water before irrigation We needed to treat the water first The water was causing the alkalinity of the soil It's like the clothes we wear When our clothes get soaked in sweat... ... it's harder to clean and dry them You end up with stains you can't get out Ma Feng was implementing... ... what Chairman Mao said about strength in unity If one family... ... tried to solve the problem of alkaline soil... ... it couldn't be done How to make it happen? We needed to mobilize everyone in the village We took Ma Feng's advice With three families, then five, then ten... ... we formed... ... what we called 'mutual aid groups' We mapped out a plan for the village When we'd figured it all out... ... there were thirty to forty people in each group And each group took about ten days... ... to finish the preparations We started by filtering the fresh water Then drained away the salty water And then let the sun do its work It was just like drying clothes outdoors, under the sun Bit by bit, the seeds took root They germinated Nothing died, the seedlings flourished They grew The mutual aid groups... ... speeded things up We went on to form a production team It was based on individual production units We were highly motivated As a result of all this hard work... ... Jia Family Village became quite famous Lots of people came to see our progress Other villages were still short of grain They couldn't feed themselves Relied on food coupons But we had plenty to eat We even had surpluses! In fact we had enough surplus... ... to sell grain to the government We ended up contributing one million kilos to the state "Working the land, standing tall..." "Raising his work-tool even higher..." "He holds the hoe up in the air..." "As if he were holding..." "... a flag of toil" He holds the hoe up in the air as if he were holding a flag of toil - Yu Jian I like what you are And I like how you behave - Straightforward, optimistic... - It's true He could hear you with his hearing aid How old are you? I'm Ninety-one Bring it over I can hear now In the past, the village had three "too many"s Too many unmarried men Too many young children sold away And too many beggars Life was so hard here... ... that no-one would marry our men There was a saying... "Don't marry your daughter into Jia Family Village" Those who came here to marry would suffer So no-one did That's why there were so many unmarried men Ma Feng... The first time we met was in 1953 In the spring of that year I was First Secretary of the Communist Youth League We were having a meeting that evening Talking about... The county League had given us three promotional tasks One was to promote the Marriage Law It came into force in 1953 Second, to promote the collective procurement and distribution of grain And finally, to promote collectivization To encourage people to join co-operatives Mutual aid We were in the middle of the meeting... Assigning tasks... ... when Old Jia arrived with Ma Feng Old Jia came in and said... "This is our League's First Secretary" We knew that he was a writer But we didn't know he was such a big name We just knew that he was a writer He loved joking, making fun of this and that Our members loved listening to him He smoked a fat little cigar About this thick, but quite short He invited us all to try it He even invited the girls who were there! We were all teenagers But he offered his cigar regardless Laughing, we said we couldn't smoke You could have it all yourself! That made us laugh Lots of us were there that night He said that to promote the Marriage Law... ... we should take the lead ourselves Find ourselves partners! "What about you with him? Or you with her?" He was fooling around with us "You look like a good match for him" "You two look good together" He became the League matchmaker She and I... In fact he matched three couples in our League We got together and married So to speak... He planted a seed in people's minds A seed of love That was when people starting seeing each other, forming couples When love became a freedom of choice Arranged marriages were outlawed We were free to choose marriage partners "In the mountains and rivers" "I would like to hold your hand" "To cross the bridge" "On the bridge are red flowers, green leaves" "Families and rivers are nearby" "On this side of the bridge, hair is black" "On that side, hairs have turned white" On this side of the bridge, hair is black On that side, hairs have turned white - Shen Congwen My father Ma Feng was born in 1922 23 May in the lunar calendar It was in Juyi Village, in Xiaoyi County When my father was born... ... my grandfather was over fifty And my grandmother was still in her twenties When grandfather died... ... the family went downhill Nothing went well My grandmother wanted to raise this son herself So she refused to remarry, despite being so young She sold the house and land Took the money And returned to Dawang Village, in Fenyang So my father, from the age of six or seven... ... grew up in Dawang Village When he finished school... Not long after that... ... the Anti-Japanese War began When he was in the army His squad leader was... Sun Qian The writer Sun Qian His involvement in the arts began by accident Father liked painting when he was young Back then, the platoons... ... held a blackboard newspaper competition He remembered a magazine he'd once seen The illustrations in it... ... were woodcut prints They showed soldiers with machine guns in the undergrowth Taking aim at the enemy There were no paints available Only ink He made the best of it He did a big ink drawing No paintbrushes, only an inkbrush So that's what he used The competition was judged the day after he finished it And his platoon ended up as the winners So they decided he was a talent He seemed to be talented That got him transferred to the publicity team... ... which was actually a performance troupe In 1940, the troupe... ... crossed the Yellow River and went to Yan'an He was very impressed by Yan'an He said there were so many books in Yan'an A great cultural climate Later on, someone told him... The Lu Xun Academy of Fine Arts... ... had a school for the military My father applied... ... and was admitted My father applied for the art major He was a life-model for the art class Why did he want to do that? Because he could read while posing You know which book had the biggest influence on him? It was 'And Quiet Flows the Don' After he graduated from the Academy... ... he became a journalist At the start of 1945... It was either the end of 1944 or the start of 1945... ... there was a conference on outstanding workers at Mount Lüliang They were sharing stories of heroes My father and his colleague were sent there As both journalists and volunteers After that, they began writing their... 'Heroes of Mount Lüliang' He and Xirong, the two of them... They took turns writing it... ... "You do today's, I'll do tomorrow's" It was serialised in 'Jinxi Public Newspaper' They kept up daily instalments for a while Then they thought they should take a break They stopped for a couple of days But the readers complained about its absence So they went back to writing it That's how that book took shape They'd begun it in the spring of 1945 Japan had not yet surrendered The war was still on-going In the run-up to October 1949... ... my father attended a Youth Conference in Beijing He went as a Youth Leader And after that, he stayed in Beijing to work That was when he came to know the literary world He was almost thirty by then But he wasn't married, and didn't even have a girlfriend One time he went back to Xiaoyi to see his mother... ... and saw a couple of newlyweds on the train Observing this young couple... ... he thought how interesting they were It inspired him to write 'Marriage' His story was about how marriage... ... changes the lives of young people When it was published... ... it caught someone's eye He had the idea of filming it When this man found out my father wasn't married himself... ... he thought he should intervene This was a director called Guo Wei He'd once been my mother's supervisor... ... at a theater in Hebei He was plotting to make this introduction But he didn't have a photo of my mother All he had was a group photo of the theater company When the time came, he showed my father this group photo He told him... "I want to introduce you to one of the girls in this photo" "Guess which one it is" My father studied the photo He thought, she looks nice... But some seem a bit too... Anyway, not suitable Some were too pretty Some were too old Some, probably already married In the end, he pointed to one girl in the photo "Is it this one?" And yes, he picked my mother! He tried writing about city life in Beijing But he wasn't happy with the results But when he left Beijing for Shanxi... ... and started writing in and about the countryside... ... his fiction became quite popular 'Stockman Uncle Zhao' for example And 'Han Meimei' It became very popular Both those short stories were selected... ... for student textbooks Chinese studies He'd thought he should focus on rural topics That's why he went back to the countryside Back to Shanxi The one who objected strongly was my grandfather He was originally from Hebei He thought since they had a place in Beijing... And were settled there... What was the point of moving back to Shanxi? He had no idea what Shanxi was like There was no comparison between Beijing and Shanxi It's the difference between a capital city and a provincial town There's a huge gap It was not at all pleasant when we first moved Our lives were entirely different And the local dialect was different Being from Hebei, he could understand the Beijing dialect But he could barely grasp a word of the Shanxi dialect I came to Jia Family Village when I was very little With my parents We arrived and lived in the village Actually, his writing had a very intimate connection with this place He was writing non-stop My father wrote about many people When the villagers read it, they knew who it was about "That character is you!" "That's about you" and so on 'The Young People of Our Village'... ... depicted China's first generation of educated farmers How should they appear? They should be literate... The characters were about those educated farmers The People's Republic had celebrated its tenth anniversary People were getting decent educations How was their life when they returned to their villages? What you can see here... ... is a general view of Jia Family Village It shows both the village as it is now... ... and the plans for its future What are you doing here? Nothing, Sir We're just chatting Chatting? Show me what's in your bag I've been thinking, at the Literature Festival... ... I'll be able to see the writers in person I can listen to what they say It's a site for literary encounters No particular obligation this time I'm there to have fun Jia Zhang-ke told me I'd have fun any time Jia Family Village Good afternoon to all our Festival friends Let's hear it for our next guest He's a renowned writer... Let's welcome Mr Yu Hua to the stage We've come to Fenyang Coming here... ... feels like... ... being Brahms... ... when he went to visit Schumann in his country house So being here... All of us, whether we're authors or readers... We're all like Brahms We're in Fenyang We're in Jia Family Village It's a group visit to our country home We use our own... ... individual voices... ... to make... ... the so-called lonely countryside... ... lively again God created the village Man created the city Take our house... Back then, it was my grandfather's house Situated below the dam Coming back here... A lot has changed We've used the word "nostalgia" many times today Girls in the villages most likely... From the point of view of equality... It's very hard to win a real place Since there's been so much rebuilding... ... the layout has changed a lot I couldn't even orient myself Knowing a place is... ... like being in an airport You can take off... ... and fly back some time later Opera is like an open classroom for the people Actors are teachers in make-up You became a rabbit I became an eagle to catch you We always miss things that are lost Modernization needs... ... to be interpreted differently Fenyang Middle School has a history of 113 years That's twelve years more than the history of Chinese modern poetry I think villages... ... are the reality I notice how people wait for trains Some of them squat down In my hometown, not least in my extended family... ... almost every family unit has someone working in Guangdong We usually drink tea from Hanzhong It's also... ... Anji white tea Actually, I don't like Anji white tea I prefer Shangluo white tea There's a Shangluo white tea? Shangluo white tea is good One time... ... I went out with some Xi'an University teachers One of them told me... He managed to get you to drink white tea Nonsense! I'm bringing out my poetry collection The second? The second and third will both come out later this year It will include unpublished earlier poems? These are all new I wrote them after the first collection came out Writing poetry... I have nothing against it But the first thing... ... is to live a good life First, be a good person Fulfill your duties as a wife and mother in the family And then write poetry And be a good daughter too! Actually, I don't care about that The main thing is that... ... writing poetry doesn't mean living a poetic life Dihua lies in the basin of the Qin Mountains There's a river near the village Nowadays it's called the River Dan Back then, it wasn't called that We used to call it the State River "State" as in city-state, that character When I was very young... ... I could see boats on the river from the village Of course boats can't sail there now The water's too shallow for boats I remember when I was in primary school... In the third or fourth year... I went to my aunt's place And she had a copy of 'Dream of the Red Chamber' A hardcover copy, I don't know where she got it It was in four volumes That was the first time I ever read it That time, visiting my aunt At first sight, all the poems at the start... And all the mythological stuff... That made no sense to me When I reached the main text... And it was about daily life... I felt I understood it It was an interesting read Although it was about life in a great mansion... ... and I lived in a village... ... it nonetheless intrigued me I enjoyed reading it Since I could stay for only one night... ... when I left the next day... ... I 'borrowed' two volumes When I got home... ... my cousin noticed that two volumes were missing He knew I loved reading and must have taken them So he came to demand them back In my early years, in my family... ... there were already more than twenty people When I was in primary school... ... I remember there were already twenty-three If everyone was there... ... we had to serve twenty-three mouths with one wok At that time... ... my 'po' was still alive 'Po' was our word for grandmother My father had three brothers And they each had more than one child Twenty-odd people, all squeezed together The conditions were rather difficult... ... with so many people If you can imagine, this huge family... ... was like the one in 'Dream of the Red Chamber' Every daughter-in-law of my father's generation... ... all my aunts... ... including my mother... ... took turns to cook for everyone Each had to do it for a whole week Whoever was handling the ladle... ... she'd be sure to serve her own kids... ... the thickest congee The rest of us made do with what was left All from the one wok Everyone served themselves In the end, people tried to hide the ladle Why was that? Because the ladle could reach the bottom Where the best stuff was The burnt rice at the bottom tasted better Everyone tried to get to it first Anyhow, times were pretty hard But we didn't split up Because my 'po' was still there, she held the family together Until 1958 That was when mandatory communal kitchens came in People couldn't get along, and the family split up The year I started junior high... ... the Cultural Revolution began Actually, the schools were already closed by 1966 We'd just reached mathematical simple equations My father was a teacher ... urban and rural separate ... urban and rural separate My mother was a housewife If a mother was classed as a 'rural citizen'... ... her children were also classed as 'rural' There was 'household registration' And that was linked to food coupons Without that piece of paper... ... you couldn't even stay in a hotel Without food coupons... ... you had nothing to eat "There's an old saying..." "The place you're born..." "... is the place that half-buries you" "That's why 'birthplace' is also called 'blood land' " That's why 'birthplace' is also called 'blood land' - Jia Pingwa The college my father went to... ... was later renamed 'Shaanxi Normal University' He studied there, and when he graduated... ... he was assigned to a suburb of Xi'an A teaching post in Tianjiawan Primary School The Chinese civil war was coming to an end When it ended in 1949, the Communist Party took power Xi'an had been ruled by Hu Zongnan He was a KMT general, and he was in charge here He was known as 'King of the North-west' He had both political and military power Not long before the KMT retreat... ... he convened a big meeting in Xi'an Later, during the Cultural Revolution... ... this meeting was reclassified... ... as training for the KMT secret service And whoever had been at the meeting... ... was for the 'secret service training'... Well, my father and five or six other teachers... ... came by foot from Tianjiawan to attend it About halfway there... ... my father sneaked away with another guy They went to Yisu Theater to see Shaanxi opera So they never went to the meeting at all But his name was on the attendance list! They checked the record during the Cultural Revolution And there was his name! The record said he was there The matter... ... was reported to Xi'an Since the meeting was now classed as 'secret service training'... ... my father was accused of being a KMT secret agent He was fired from his job Sent back to his birthplace to do forced labor We had to move back too When he arrived... ... under armed military escort... ... I was working on the land I was doing some farm job on the mountain and I saw him He was walking along the road With two armed escorts behind him The moment I saw him, I rushed back home He'd already been reassigned... ... to the local production brigade At home, Father was lying on the kang bed When he saw me, he cried That was the only time I saw him cry Because, in his mind, my father... ... always thought of me as a scholar He thought I'd go to high school And then to college But now I'd been sent back to the village too I probably wouldn't get to university... ... since he was a 'counter-revolutionary' He thought my future was hopeless My brother, three years younger... ... was as tall as me We two brothers... ... started working in the production brigade One day's work earned three points And one point, at that time... ... was worth twenty cents The normal rate for an adult male was ten points per day Worth twenty cents per point For women, it was eight points per day That made one Chinese dollar and sixty cents I could only earn three points That amounted to very little money Sixty cents per day Just sixty cents Back then, the villages... ... were preparing for war with the Soviet Union All of the young people... ... had to register in militias Every day there was training to prepare for war ... until my father was named as a 'counter-revolutionary' And sent back to his birthplace That disqualified me from being in the militia They threw me out When they recruited, I applied to rejoin But I could never pass the background checks I remember having the physical examination Someone checked your ears This part of you and that I passed those tests, but never made it on to the list Later, they started hiring geological workers I tried that too They accepted my application... ... but disqualified me after two or three rounds of checks Still later, they needed road maintenance workers We didn't have asphalt roads then They were still sand roads They always needed maintenance workers... ... to shovel sand from the roadside ditches... ... and flatten the roads That was the job Very often the work was in... ... quite remote areas I applied, and the checks took forever In the end, I was rejected again Then, in 1969, there was mass mobilization... ... in water conservation for agriculture At the time, Chairman Mao said... "Water conservation is the lifeblood of agriculture" Everywhere began building reservoirs Our county planned three of them And one was in my home village One rainy day I put on a back-pack... ... with a bag of corn grits in it Even though it was a construction job... ... you had bring your own grains for communal cooking I rushed to be first in line for the job I paced in front of the construction office... ... hoping someone would notice me As I hoped, the commander greeted me I said "I'm here to work" He knew I had good handwriting Then he asked if I'd be willing to work for the office I was more than happy to So he gave me a bucket of paint and a broad brush And that afternoon he assigned me... ... to paint slogans on the rocks I climbed up the rocks... ... tied a rope around my waist... ... and hung down to paint the slogans Everyone was pleased That's how... ... I came to work for the construction office That was a good preparation for college Soon after that, universities started enrolling students... ... based on recommendations The ones they took were called 'worker-peasant-soldier students' They were the children of workers, peasants and soldiers Hence the name My father's case had not yet been re-examined But there were signs... ... that he might be rehabilitated Since I was classed as a 'reformable child'... ... I was allowed to apply I've been in Xi'an ever since "Cast a cold eye on the world" I studied arts at Northwest University... ... and published twenty-two pieces during my college years In September 1975 I was assigned to Shaanxi People's Publishing House Strictly speaking, the Cultural Revolution wasn't over There was barely any market for literature Given the times, I tried writing revolutionary stories Essays, novels Even traditional songs And poems I wrote everything When we reached the 1980s... ... Chinese writing in general came to be thought of... ... as literature of the new era That marked the start of real modern literature Why? Well, there was foreign literature Modern work It began appearing in Chinese translations The first I learned about the west was from the arts From introductions to foreign artworks Van Gogh Paul Gauguin, Pablo Picasso Cubism, Fauvism, Impressionism and Structuralism There were books... ... about all these movements I thought I could become an artist by learning this But when it came to my writing, it was hard I didn't know what path to take Because at that time, you either... ... imitated western models, or... Whenever something new comes along... ... people tend to absorb it by imitating it What they're really trying to see is what's the boundary Is there a breakthrough? Can it be improved? But I was facing a different blockage I didn't know what I wanted to write I was young, impulsive and curious I wanted to write down everything I saw Looking back at that time... ... I called myself a roving bandit My work had no roots I just wrote whatever my gun was aimed at I was sure it wouldn't work, I feared the worst Then, sometime between 1982 and 1984... ... that was when it struck me I should go back home Back to my birthplace, Shangluo So off I went, and found someone I knew Someone who could take me around There was no public transport, so it was hard to get around We only had bicycles... ... and cycled back to base every night Every morning, at random, we'd visit nearby villages It was delightful There was nothing to worry about in the countryside Nobody to supervise you Just two or three of us, riding our bikes It felt free! We ate wherever we went When we were hungry, we simply stopped to buy some food Or paid local people to cook for us in their homes In the evenings... ... we slept wherever we could But that was when my body failed me I got sick I was in the worst pain I've ever experienced Those times brought me great joy... But also the worst pain I'd caught a cold and been to a clinic for a shot The clinic had an alcohol stove Lots of needles in the boiling water They used boiling water to sterilize back then Everyone who came with a cold... ... would get a shot with a new needle They gave me the injection And it made me very ill I was infected with... ... Hepatitis B I found only later that there'd been a local hepatitis epidemic I've been treated for it ever since It took fifteen years to recover During that period, I wrote a lot Stories, novellas, essays... The main essays were the 'Three Records of Shangzhou' There were so many short pieces The novellas included 'Chicken Coop Valley' After that... In 1985, 1986... I wrote the novel... ... 'Turbulence' Since that time... ... I've slowly established myself here From Shangluo... From the hometown I live in, I'm looking at China Looking at the whole world I was born on 3 April 1960, in Hangzhou My father worked in the provincial center for disease control And my mother worked in Zhejiang Hospital When I was three years old... ... my father was assigned... There was a severe outbreak of snail fever (schistosomiasis) in Zhejiang My father was transferred to Xiamen And he ended up in Haiyan They were establishing a new hospital in Haiyan So he stayed there He wrote to my mother... ... saying that things were good in Haiyan So she took my brother and me to Haiyan Later she told me... ... there weren't even any bicycles in Haiyan back then We lived in the workplace Right opposite the surgery... ... was the morgue The surgery faced it It was just a small bungalow My brother and I came and went freely The operating theater was inside the bungalow while my father performed surgeries and we could even go in there Many times, after midnight... ... we'd hear crying The cries of grief would wake us up Haiyan had particularly hot summers When I woke up from a nap... ... I saw that my sweat... ... left the outline of my body on the mat Homes didn't have their own bathrooms then We used the public toilet That was next door to the morgue There was a concrete slab in the morgue About this wide It was kept very, very clean In my mind, I feel in the world... When I think about the cleanest place there is... ... it's not the lobby of a five-star hotel... ... but that morgue I passed by as a child One time I took a nap there At least, I tried to... It was nice and cool When we were little... ... people thought that was unbelievable But my generation took it in its stride We don't believe in ghosts We're all atheists As an adult, I came across a poem by Heinrich Heine... "Our death is in the cool of the night" When I read that, I thought... That's me, in the morgue! That was exactly how I felt In primary school We had a classmate... ... whose father... ... he killed himself He jumped down a well Southern wells are about this wide If you jump head-first, there's no turning back The well is too narrow In a northern well, you could still hope to change your mind You could try lifting your head Roll forwards and paddle in the water Not possible in a southern well So, just like that, he killed himself We didn't know Our classmate showed up with his satchel But he was crying, he stood in a corner and cried ... did we realize that his father killed himself the night before So we asked our classmate to play ping pong with us We asked him twice and he finally came He was still crying while he waited for his turn And when he played... And even when he won, he was still crying When he won again, he smiled In our high-school years... ... we managed to read some novels Mostly books... ... which had survived the Cultural Revolution Books which hadn't been burned or confiscated They'd been hidden away Passed through many hands By the time they reached me... ... they'd lost pages at the front and back You'd have no idea how the story started... ... or how it ended Didn't know the title, or the author I soon realized that the title and author didn't matter And I could manage without knowing how the story started But it was very frustrating to not have the ending You got through it But the next book that came along was in the same condition And by the time another book came into your hands... ... a month or two had passed I was so frustrated... ... that I was haunted by those missing endings I figured out what to do As the line in the 'Internationale' goes... ... "There are no supreme saviors" We need to save ourselves Since I lay awake at night, thinking about endings... ... I came up with my own ending And if it wasn't good enough... ... I'd think of another one At that time, boys and girls didn't really speak to each other It sometimes happened that girls were bolder than boys A girl classmate once handed me a note In our school, she was given a job... ... as a school librarian The note she gave me was an accusation I'd recently returned a book And apparently I'd damaged it The pages were slightly torn But she accepted it anyway Her note made a very strong impression on me It was the first time a girl ever handed me a note... ... and it was to criticize me The note ended by saying she'd let it go this time But if it happened again, she wouldn't let me return the book I'd have to pay for the damage, something like that I got her real meaning right away Back then, nobody would write "I like you" in a note Nothing of that sort They'd use indirect or oblique expressions instead Expressing affection had to be implied, not explicit It seemed like a common-or-garden note You have no idea how complicated this all was The girl folded... She'd folded the paper down to a tiny square It probably took her only a minute or two to do it But it would take me twenty minutes to unfold it I was scared of tearing it It might have contained something beautiful! And I might have lost it! So I was very careful I worked hard to unfold it And it turned out to be a criticism! But I got her real point In the following days... ... I noticed she kept looking at me It made me a bit nervous Eventually I decided to tell her... ... that I was interested in her too But I suddenly realized... ... that she'd lost interest in me Not long after that... ... we went to a place called Ganpu We were in the middle of some military training... ... when we heard a loudspeaker announcement The Gang of Four had been arrested After that, college entrance exams started again I took the exam in 1977 and failed I failed again in 1978 So I gave up trying... ... and went to become a dentist In 1977, the government had already ended... ... the 'Learn from Peasants and Workers' movement Urban students were still stuck in the countryside... But nobody was being sent to remote villages any more Some of my classmates were assigned to factories Some went to work in department stores I ended up in Wuyuan County Health Center Maybe it was my fate... ... to become a dentist I didn't like the work at all All day staring into people's open mouths! The worst view in the world Day after day I was still young I wanted to see the world and the rest of the country I could barely imagine what the world was like But I wanted to travel and see things The dental hospital had one merit It was bang in the center of the town And my window happened to look out on a bridge And the adjoining road Whenever there was no patient to see... ... I stood looking out of that window I was feeling quite despondent Was my whole life going to be like this? I was desperate for a change I began notice that people from the Cultural Bureau... ... were always strolling about on the street The town had a small population Eight thousand people, and they all knew each other I asked them why they weren't at work And they said strolling in the streets was their work I thought, that's for me! I'd love a job like that! I asked them how I could get a job in the Cultural Bureau So I started writing fiction To begin with... ... I had no idea how to write I couldn't even get punctuation right So I looked for a short story to learn from I figured out how to build paragraphs, and began writing I had big ideas I didn't know if my story was any good or not But I sent it off to 'People's Literature' and 'Harvest' magazine When they rejected it, I tried less prestigious places Such as 'Beijing Literature' and 'Shanghai Literature' And if that didn't work either... ... I'd try sending it to random magazines in places like Lüliang The postman... Every time... He didn't knock to deliver the mail He just threw my rejection letters over the fance Every time we heard one land... ... my father said "Another rejection letter" I was determined Being rejected... ... would depress me a bit But I mainly wanted to see who'd rejected it... ... so that I could aim a bit lower next time In November of 1983... ... very late in the evening... ... I received a long-distance call This was before we got direct dialling Long-distance calls had to be connected through a switchboard We had only one switchboard operator for the whole of Haiyan The person calling was the chief editor of 'Beijing Literature' The executive chief editor he nominal chief editors were Yang Mo... ... and his deputy Wang Meng This was the executive chief editor, Zhou Yanru When I picked up the phone... ... the operator asked if I was Yu Hua I said yes, and was told... ... that someone in Beijing was calling me It took another half-hour... ... for the call to be connected It was Zhou Yanru She wanted me to come to Beijing to edit my story My very first reaction was to wonder... ... who would cover my travel and accommodation costs Zhou Yanru was really nice, a lovely old lady And an experienced editor She said "Yu Hua..." Those were her first words "I placed this call this morning" "The day's almost over, and I was about to give up" "I thought I wouldn't get through today" "So I'd try again tomorrow" "Then suddenly I got connected" She talked about the three stories I'd sent them I'd already forgotten that I'd sent three "One of them needs some editing" She went on... "We'll pay for your travel and accommodation" "Plus an allowance" I was on the coach next morning To Shanghai I bought a standing-class ticket at the rail station And stood all the way to Beijing There I met my editor I met Zhou Yanru She discussed the editing with me "Your stories were very well written" "But one of them..." "... has a gloomy ending" "In a socialist country like ours..." "... such things cannot happen" I asked her "Teacher Zhou, what do you suggest?" She said "You need to change it" I asked "Do you mean giving it a happy ending?" She said yes I asked if she'd still publish it with a happy ending You see, I was bargaining That was me being me Even the people at 'Harvest' heard about this later She said "If it has a happy ending, we'll publish it" I said "If you agree to publish it, I'll make it happy all the way through!" She replied... "You young people!" "A happy ending will do, it doesn't need to start happy" "The beginning isn't very dark anyway, not so dark" "It's just that the ending is a bit gloomy" "A happy ending will do, it doesn't need to start happy" It took me just one day to change it I remember there was a writer from Henan, famous back then He was bursting with pride Because he'd just won a National Short Story Award Zhou Yanru introduced me to him "This young man is Yu Hua" "He's only twenty-three" "He writes good stories" "He's very bright" "It took him one day to edit his story" "Some writers need half a month..." "A whole month or even two months to do that" "But he got it done in one day" I was thinking, it's just a happy ending Nothing to it! She told me my stories would appear in the first issue of 1984 I was ready to head home once the editing was done But Zhou Yanru was really kind She said "Yu Hua, it wasn't easy for you to get to Beijing" It never crossed my mind that I'd live in Beijing one day I just said "Well..." She said "Enjoy yourself a bit" So I stayed for a month I went everywhere I could Eventually I had to ask her... ... where else I could go Every place she mentioned, I'd already been to In the end she had to say "Time to go home" She calculated the allowance they were giving me I felt rich for the very first time Since I had to take the train... ... they bought me a ticket back to Shanghai Since it was a business trip, I was entitled to civil service treatment That meant I got a sleeper berth But I changed it for standing-class I didn't even choose a seat! And I pocketed the difference in price I'd been there for a whole month My per diem was two Chinese dollars a day That was the going rate in 1983 When I got home, I had in my wallet... ... eighty-odd dollars, almost ninety I felt very rich When the train stopped in Shandong... ... I bought four roast chicken for my father Four roast chicken Because he was originally from Shandong After that, I became a Haiyan celebrity My editor had been very thoughtful She asked if I needed a letter to explain my absence I agreed that I did I'd been gone for a month And the hospital didn't even know about it So she gave me a letter... ... vouching for the purpose of my trip The hospital chief was furious at first But the letter... ... convinced him that I was someone important The leaders discussed the matter They concluded that it was a big deal In all the years of the People's Republic... ... I was the first local person to be published in Beijing They suggested transferring me to the Cultural Bureau So that was when I changed my job Towards the end of 1987... Or maybe in early 1988... I took delivery of some letters I forget if it was three or four They were all asking for stories from me And they all wanted them within a week One was from 'October' magazine I showed my father these letters Laid them on the table and said, "Look." My father took a look and asked what I was getting at I told him, "This is fame" I started out submitting work, now they're asking for it "Your son is famous now" People ask me what it's like to be famous I tell them that was the only time I had that feeling Since then, never "Remembering the past or longing for your native place..." "... are, in reality, ways of reaching for reassurance..." "... when we feel some disorientation in life" "Even if feelings are involved, they're purely decorative" Remembering the past or longing for your native place... ... are, in reality, ways of reaching for reassurance - Yu Hua We swam here every summer as kids One time I wondered where I'd get to if I kept swimming But then I got caught in a current I knew not to fight it, I just had to let it carry me I was carried along for some twenty kilometres... ... before I finally scrambled ashore I had to walk all the way back, barefoot Dawn was almost breaking In October 1989, I entered Beijing University Life on campus was all peace and joy Through open windows... ... you could hear people playing mahjong Around Weiming Lake, you saw couples dating And then in the 1990s, especially after Deng Xiaoping toured southern China... ... the whole nation went into business The result was economic prosperity Some who'd become writers like me... ... abandoned their careers to become entrepreneurs People who'd been together went their separate ways Exploring their own paths I finished writing 'Cries in the Drizzle' And in 1993 I published 'To Live' I wrote about a man's whole life notice: "Wanted by the Police" Let's listen Let's share This is Haiyan People's Radio Station. FM 106 MHz Physics is the opposite of metaphysics Why? Socrates said that Then that's philosophy, isn't it? No. Since you bring up Socrates... How many pupils did he have? Yeah... Plato Socrates and Plato Plato was Socrates' student In September 1997... ... I was mastering in Chinese at Zhengzhou University That was the year that Hong Kong reverted to China's sovereignty But I wasn't really conscious... ... of such momentous things I seemed to be immersed... ... in my own world I moved to Beijing in September 2000 My first impression of the city was quite good I was studying literature at Beijing Normal University September was the best season in Beijing Autumnal, with clear skies and nice weather But when I'd applied to do the PhD in April... ... the city was hit by the most severe sandstorms That was in April 2000 From the start, I was greeted with thick, sandy dust That was 23 April, the day we had to sit the entrance exam Despite the sandstorm I couldn't understand... ... why all the girls on the street covered their faces with scarves Come 2007... I'd got my PhD four years earlier I'd given birth to my son He was two years old And I felt that a chapter in my life was coming to an end It was time to move on to a new phase But it suddenly felt very difficult It's hard to explain Life seemed to be good Living conditions were improving But everything felt wrong The word 'betrayal' lingered in my mind I couldn't shake it During the summer break, I made the decision that I'd go home Though I couldn't quite say why, even though I did not quite know why I knew I was going to write something, I wasn't sure what But I absolutely needed to go back for a while This was different from previous trips home They'd been more like short visits Village tourism, hanging out by the river Seeing what it all looked like... But this time, what I had in mind was something more serious I wanted to write In 'China in Liang Village'... ... I wrote about Liang Village Its elders, its women and its children I included the river by the village The natural environment Also, the current situation in the village When I interviewed the people, for instance... ... when a family received a call from far away... ... everyone was so joyful Or when someone sent money back, the day became so festive I gradually came to realize... ... that the workers who've migrated to other places... ... are still part of village life, even though they're usually away I was born in the 1970s The rural order was beginning to recover I could still recall the days of the 'production unit' But not in any detail I think my earliest real memories... ... were formed in the 1980s At that point, my sisters and brothers were all in school My family was very poor But my father was very insistent on one point He insisted that we were all educated Nobody was migrating to other places yet You pretty much lived on what you could harvest Everyone lived on farmland Food was very limited Sometimes you had to look for edible wild plants Or grow some tobacco or peppers Stuff you could sell... ... to cover some of the cost of living At Chinese New Year or other big festivals... ... we could get up to a kilo of meat from the county There were six girls in the family And my mother had medical issues In the years... ... before I became sensible and responsible, she was already paralysed I was admitted to high school at fifteen Before that... ... time passed... ... extremely slowly My elder sister was another worry As she reached puberty, she got into a relationship I already knew that things like that, could be difficult And my younger sister had asthma Anyhow, it was... ... all very hard It's even hard for me to talk about these things Not to mention my mother She rarely spoke It's as if she's a shadow in my heart ... which never goes away Even now that I'm an adult, it seems I still can't talk about it I guess there may be many things in life which you never get over I once said, if the day comes when I can... ... speak freely and frankly about my mother... ... then that will be the day I have my emotions under control That day hasn't come yet I was six years old when my mother had a stroke That was common enough in the rural areas Probably caused by mother's high blood pressure but we knew nothing about that then We had access to only very basic medical services And we had no money for doctors It started with hemiparesis, she could still walk But one side of her body was weakened During my time in primary school... ... my mother exercised every morning When I walked home after school... ... she was often nearby on the same road I later realized she was probably waiting for me Maybe she wanted to pick me up from school But she felt embarrassed because of her disability... She was quite shy Anyhow, we'd head home together By the time she was confined to her bed... That was when she suffered complete paralysis She was in a near-vegetative state Even then, she was eager to communicate The family kept up the basic courtesies When we left for school, we'd call 'Bye, Ma!' By then she couldn't speak She would shed a tear... ... to respond to us That had a huge impact on me I can't really talk about it Her state... She was breathing But she couldn't say a word It was so painful My father had a really good reputation He was the one who took my mother to hospital And he cared for her devotedly We were all like that in our family I still went to school, despite all the problems I remember when we didn't have the money... ... to pay for the tuition, maybe six or eight dollars Couldn't afford it So I had to stand outside the classroom Until we'd saved enough money The teacher had no choice if we couldn't pay He made us stand outside I stood there for a month That was the longest period I had to stand outside As I recall, the experience wasn't at all shaming Just rather sad Then my father would take me... Together with my sisters, I think... From door to door in the village to borrow money Twenty cents here, thirty cents there, or even one dollar He had ideas and really wanted to make more money Because we were so poor But every business he started failed in the end After my mother passed away... ... his reputation went down He was in his forties Just as I am now Maybe he could find a new wife and have more children? Actually, there were no more children In those days, country villages gossiped about such matters all the time Anyhow, my sisters and I reached adolescence... And we were always fighting Father tried to start a business We didn't know where he'd got to Actually, he went to Shanxi It should be I forgot what was it called And this friend introduced him to a local woman We knew almost nothing about it Hardly anything, in fact The woman was a victim of domestic violence I heard later that her husband used to beat her She wanted to leave My father's friend asked him to help out Since we're on the plains Henan is on the plains He asked my father to get her out of the mountains He didn't ask him to marry her Next thing... ... he brought her to live in our house She'd been with us for about a month when... ... we said we'd try to find her a husband But she didn't want to marry anyone other than our father She said he was such a nice person My father was indeed very kind to women His only weakness was being so sweet to his wife Very sweet indeed When my father brought this woman... ... back to our house in Henan... ... my instant reaction was to cry Conflicts followed The local villagers, it seems to me now... ... saw her as something of a joke Many of them watched our family as if we were a soap opera I hated that feeling of being watched Since I was scared... ... I hid myself away in dark corners My brother was fifteen or sixteen at the time He was quite obstinate And my sisters were seventeen and eighteen It was an all-round difficult situation, as I look back Lots of fighting... ... both with father and with the woman She was very unhappy... ... because she also contributed to the family If you ask me now, I'd say it was all unnecessary But none of us could control their anger And we didn't know how to deal with the new relationship And my father was kind of helpless Since he was such a kind man... ... he wanted to please his new 'wife'... ... and us too In the end, no-one was pleased And he faced a big dilemma I used to think I no longer liked him Didn't love him But when I reached this age and... ... came to write about Liang Village My father was deeply involved in my research for the books He came back with me for 'China in Liang Village' And for 'Leaving Liang Village' he joined me ... as I went around the country, recording interviews... ... finding people who came from Liang Village During that period... ... we got to know and understand each other again Eventually, the woman left She left my father She probably couldn't stand the situation any more One time, when we'd grown up, we went looking for her We were all married by then My father missed her He nagged us We just had to take him to see her I didn't go Three of my sisters took him When the two of them saw each other, they broke down in tears "Father has always been my question" "And the biggest question of all..." "... is his white shirt" "In those days..." "... the old road from Wu County to Liang Village was still nice and flat" "Tall, straight poplar trees on both sides" "Father was hurrying home from Wu County..." "... and I was on my way to school" "We passed each other on the road" "In the shade of the trees..." "... Father's white shirt was clean and neat" "Soft, tidy..." "It shone like a beam of light" Father has always been my question - Liang Hong "What trouble did Father have to save enough money..." "... for such a costly unnecessary, luxurious white shirt?" "How did he keep it stainless all year round?" One of my sisters was the eldest in the family There was a saying in the village My father liked to repeat it "People would rather be mules or horses..." "... than eldest sons and daughters" Our family is a case in point My eldest sister went to a vocational school That used to be considered a high qualification Once she completed the course... ... she had a choice between working in Beijing and a job in Zhengzhou She had plenty of good offers Because of the family... She came back to the county to work at a local health center This was in the 1980s A high-school diploma counted for a lot She could earn twelve Chinese dollars a month Unimaginable to the rest of us She would keep two dollars for herself And give the rest to us And every time she visited... ...she'd bring me a gift, such as a pair of sneakers They cost more than one dollar I'd be so excited, running around the village in my new shoes I still keep... ... the letters between my father and my sister They depended on each other And tried to solve the family's problems together In some sense, I think... ... my father's trust in her made her more important to us She was always the one we counted on We could hide behind her back We could cry But she could not She had to solve problems When there was no money, she had to make money And we were always short of money What with my mother's illness... With our schooling... With our food and clothing... It was like a big black hole And she was the one who had to fill it She worried about it for years But my sister has a big heart If life's hard, you have to be optimistic She's pretty and open-minded But because the rest of us were so dependent on her... ... men from good family backgrounds would be scared off... ... when they heard about us Eventually... She found her husband My brother-in-law is great A very nice person His family was as poor as ours So neither side looks down on the other My sister... ... organised the wedding... ... and the banquet all by herself My father was as usual... ... caught up in lots of hassles She made it easy for him On the eve of the wedding, we shared a bed In the middle of the night, I knew she was crying I'm lost for words "Xiumei, your letter was received and read with care" "Your father's tears run down his face" "And drop on to this paper" "You remind me of many things in my life" "I shed many tears, I cried out loud" "You said you had things to say to your loved ones" "You're right" "When family members talk together, their words can relieve heartaches" "It's been a long time since I last had a letter from you" "Or heard your voice" "It felt like losing my guide" "As if the machine had run out of gas" "Family life seemed to have ground to a halt" "Daughter, you have so much on your mind" "Studying, housekeeping..." "Teaching your siblings..." "Caring for your mother..." "And persuading your father" "Thank you for all of it" "It makes me fee I..." "... as if I'm the daughter" "Wheat, plant" "It's hard to detect growth" "Life on this earth is one and the same" "In the field, the three elms fall into silence" "Like Father..." "Mother, and Child" In the field, the three elms fall into silence Like Father, Mother, and Child - Xi Chuan My name is Wang Yiliang I remember I was born in Henan and raised in Beijing My mother is Liang Hong And my father is Wang Hengtao I turned fourteen this year I study at Renda Middle School I like physics In my spare time, I sometimes watch TV and play video games I read about this river in my Ma's book She says the river used to be much closer to the village Over many years, the river has changed its course "Thirty years on the east, thirty years on the west" I find that saying especially touching When I was younger, I had no idea how time would change things Every time I came here... Mostly I just hung out with my cousins I didn't see much of my grandfather We didn't see much of each other And towards the end of his life... ... I had few chances to see him I'd like to have known... When he was young, did he have enough to eat? I'd like to have asked him... Did he ever want to see the world? See how other people lived? Can you introduce yourself in Henan dialect? I've pretty much forgotten my Henan dialect Give it a try!
