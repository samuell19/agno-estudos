No one has to know. No one in the entire fucking world. CRAZY CHE OCTOBER, 1994 ONE YEAR BEFORE HIS SENTENCE -Hello. -Yes? Good morning, how are you? It's Guillermo. He called me on the phone... FRIEND ...and said he was going to pay me a visit. -Where are you? -At my brother's house. Listen. I wanted to know if we could talk on Tuesday or something like that. We went to a restaurant where there were just a few customers. There were few people. He said, "You know how I stopped contacting you for years? He was working for the United States in Cuba. And from Cuba... for the United States." I felt like it was all unreal. To me it was completely unimaginable. I said, "But, why are you telling me this?" And he said, "Because I have some documentation that I need you to... keep." I had some small cassettes, called VHS-C, and I made copies with them. I went to see my friend, Esteban, and I talked to him about this. And he got scared because it was the first time that he had heard about this. He knew nothing about it. I tried to avoid the situation. "I want to bury them." And he said, "Well, I know a good place, in the Ezeiza forests." I said, "Guillermo, I can only give you ideas." Here I have one of the two bins that Guillermo filled... BROTHER ...with stolen tapes from the United States and with letters, with everything, and that's what he was going to bury in Ezeiza. Yeah, he said, "Let's go to Ezeiza," and so they went over there with a useless shovel... SISTER IN LAW ...that looked like a spoon and got all bent up. He said, "Do you have a cap or something?" We brought out several of them and he took the red one. That October day, my car was parked somewhere and someone stole my cassette player. They broke the window of the passenger's seat. The... passenger's seat was full of glass. So in those conditions I went to see Guillermo, at 9:00 or 10:00 p.m. OCTOBER 6 And I met him at the corner of San Pedrito and Juan Bautista Alberdi. He was leaning against the column with a backpack, a cap on his head... and a shovel. When I saw him, I thought, "What kind of costume is that?" This is the Ricchieri highway, it takes you to the Ezeiza airport. They were going to the Ezeiza airport. And in the forests on the sides... They were talking about where they were going to leave it. In which forest. They were driving slowly and the police came up behind them. They were following them because they thought it was suspicious that they were going so slow on a highway where you have to drive at 75 miles an hour. And here, exactly in this place, he asked me to stop the vehicle. They said they were even more surprised when the door opened and Guillermo got out with the bins. He came down out with the shovels and everything. And he says Esteban drove away and he had to cross a bridge to get back to the General Paz highway. When I was getting to the bridge, I was stopped by a police car. -"You stopped the car and a man got out." -"Yes." -"Do you know the man?" -"Yes." "Well, you've been identified. You can go on your way." They went back and they saw Guillermo with all this that he was burying. Stop! Police! At first they thought he was burying his wife. A piece of his wife. When they opened it up and asked him what it was he said, "Family pictures, stuff like that." We stopped a suspect trying to bury some bags. Here in Ezeiza. Red briefs. A cap that says "Coca-Cola." Credentials from a company called AMD, the company Intel. Photographs where you can see a video camera in what seems to be an oven. Several diskettes. A black leather appointment book with a fake back cover. Mini audio cassettes, several of them. VHS-type cassettes. A camping shovel. A foreign magazine, "Time," with Fidel Castro's face on the cover. At night, when he didn't come back, I got scared. We all got scared. We thought it could be one of two worse things: That the Cubans had caught him and put a bullet in his head. Or that the CIA or FBI had caught him and were taking him back. And on the next day I told a friend, "Sergio, you know, this thing happened to me." And he said, "Don't tell me it was you." "Ezeiza: An Argentine Double Agent is Caught." And he showed me this newspaper. When I saw this, I couldn't believe it. I read... "Double agent." Look... They put me in a cell and General Antonietti walked in. I had always thought, having seen spy movies and everything, that these things only happened in movies. But in his case it's like... he's an Argentine spy. They asked me about Iran, about China. They asked me about the Operation Condor. They asked me about the attack on the Argentine-Jewish Association, about the bombing at the Israeli embassy. And after all that they said, "The CIA wants to talk to you. Do you want to talk?" SATURDAY, OCTOBER 8 But what surprised me the most was that Guillermo called me on the phone that night. He said, "Esteban, didn't I tell you I'd support you? I'm calling you from the street." "Guillermo, you son of a bitch. You can't imagine how worried I was. Bastard!" Since they let him go two days later, I thought, "They realized that he's insane and they let him go." High in the sky A brave warrior eagle Rises up In triumphant flight With one blue wing The color of the sky And one blue wing The color of the sea. I'm Guillermo Gaede's older brother. Víctor was born first, then me, then Guillermo and then Osvaldo. The first letters of our names spell "vago" in Spanish, which means "bum." We were born at home, in Western Lanús, on Mendoza and Viamonte. We lived there, in my case, since 1951, Billy, 1952 and Osvaldo, 1954. They were Peronists. I mean... Dad always talked about the good times under Hitler. In my house, people had a good opinion of Hitler. My mom always criticized communism. And then in 1959, since things couldn't get any worse in the country, politically, we went to the United States. A year went by and we got a letter from Immigration. And it said, "You've been here for a year. Do you want to become citizens?" No, we had no interest. We didn't answer. The next year, we got a letter in which they pressured us a bit more. "You've been here for two years. Have you actually thought about becoming citizens?" We didn't answer. And each time they got more... The fifth year they said something like, "Why don't you want to become American citizens? What's the problem?" Because, at that time, the country was at war, with Vietnam under Kennedy. And if you were a citizen they would take you straight over there. So my dad said, "Look, if you want, I'll go back." So they said yes, there's no problem. They took all the stuff we had, and put it in a container and sent us back to Argentina. Everyone has to know that. Billy started getting involved in communism when he was at Entel. The estate telephone company. I think I was 21. I was working at Entel. And one of my co-workers, after talking to me so many times had realized what my political leanings were and one day he came up to me and said, "Do you want to become a member of the communist party?" And I said, "Yes." We were all more or less of that ideology. I honestly don't remember him ever... expressing his political ideas or positions. Arise ye workers from your slumbers... Well, he used to sing that. He would play the guitar and sing that. There we realized that he was going down the wrong path, according to my parents. Because my dad despised communists. He was a Nazi supporter, not a communist. I remember he was a guy, with a really big, frank smile. I mean, a good guy. In my opinion, he was... a transparent guy. FORMER CNN CORRESPONDENT I was such a fanatic of the left, of communism, and there was a program... At that time I saw a documentary about Cuba and I was fascinated. FREEDOM Here, in Sierra Maestra is where Cuba's freedom was born. From the Cuban swamp, men and women set out to conquer the most precious gift of mankind writing a glorious page of heroism. Today, Cuba has returned to the group of free nations and we pay homage to the patriots that made this return possible and primarily to Fidel Castro, the legendary figure of the tireless defender who is responsible for the feat of having removed from the continent the stain of another dictatorship. I said, "This is what we have to do in Argentina. This is the solution for Argentina too." And so I saw that and I got so excited that I went to the Cuban Embassy and told them I wanted to go to Cuba. And I did all the paperwork, I submitted my application, and Cuba didn't accept me. So I was a bit disappointed. "Why didn't they accept me? I'm a communist. I support Fidel Castro. Why won't they take me there? Why won't they accept me?" I was a little surprised, but not that disappointed. I said, "Who knows what the reason could be?" He spent more time working at home on his music than at work, where he should be. With what he earned, working six hours, he said, "It's impossible to live here in Argentina. There's no future, there's nothing here." So he said, "I'm going back to the USA." And that was when they made up their minds to go to the United States. We met on the phone. First we were friends on the phone. WIFE Long distance. I was in Bogotá and he was in Buenos Aires. And we started to talk about things... about everything, politics... We would always talk while we put our calls through. What attracted me to him was his spontaneity, his intelligence, he has always been really... He likes... He's like a child. He always likes to examine everything closely. Billy is a person that likes to help people. He's very modest in the sense that he doesn't like to wear jewelry... He doesn't care about that. But he's the kind of person that would give everything he has to anyone. If he has it and can give it away, then he does it. He's always been that way. When I got to the United States I could lie and say that I have a Green Card, because I had one and I went with my Green Card. But I didn't have a social security number, which was what I needed to work there. So I had to work under fake names. And at first I got a social security card with a valid number, under the name of Ricardo Monares. What happened? The first few weeks, or the first month or year, he would send letters saying, "I make all this money here, etc. I work 16 hours a day." And I would say, "But Billy, why wouldn't you work 16 hours a day here in Argentina? You used to work four hours, get paid for six and spent the rest of the time playing the violin and the guitar." I had parked my car next to another guy's car and I was talking to the American and he said, "What do you do?" And I said, "Electronics." Because I had started to study electronics. "Where are you going?" And I said, "I don't know, I'm looking for work." "You should go to Silicon Valley." "What's that?" And he said, "The Silicon Valley. There are lots of jobs in electronics there." And we bought the newspaper. The newspaper was this thick. And 90% of it were classified ads. At that time there were a lot of jobs. They organized what they called an "open house." All of the electronics companies had entire pages in the newspaper. One full page said "Open house." They would interview whoever wanted the job and give him a job right there. The first company that interviewed me was... AMD. I still didn't know what an integrated circuit was. I had no idea about any of that. I was studying electronic components. I was studying electricity in Illinois. In the late 70s, Silicon Valley was... INTI MICROELECTRONICS ...amazing. There was... a lot of fascination about what went on there and how it progressed. At one point, Silicon Valley was in the middle of the process of taking technology to people's homes at reasonable prices. INTERNET SAFETY In that context they must have taken people of any kind as long as they had some potential and I think that could've been Billy's case. FORMER AMD OPERATOR BILL GAEDE'S TEAM I was invisible. They didn't know I was a foreigner. No one suspected it. I spoke English all the time and no one suspected it. So I had the perfect disguise. I had already gotten a fake ID that said I was born in Chicago. I hadn't lost my socialist ideals, you know? So I came up with this crazy idea of combining both things and I thought, "One day I'm going to go to the Cubans..." They were my heroes. Che Guevara, Fidel, Cienfuegos, all those people were my heroes. I thought, "I'm going to meet them to see if they understand what I'm telling them, if they like the idea and if they would do it." I didn't ask for money or for a monument in my name. I was contributing this unilaterally. I was giving them something without asking for anything in return. So that eventually happened. It took me a couple of years, but I did it. It was in December, 1983. It was hot, I was on vacation in Buenos Aires and during that vacation I decided I wanted to start a relationship with the Cubans. ENVELOPE WITH AMD MATERIAL When he puts his mind to something he doesn't listen to anyone. He does whatever he wants. I was on the line 15 bus and I was thinking about what I was going to say, about how I was going to walk in. I was improvising, because I didn't know what I was going to find. I didn't have to ring. There was a couple there and I think I came from that side, but I'm not sure. So I got behind them and when they walked in, I walked in with them. CUBAN EMBASSY The doors opened, there was a woman there and she asked us... Hello, good afternoon. -Hi, good afternoon. -Yes, can I help you? What time do you open? We're closed now. Can I help you? But what time do you open? -It says right there. -Let's see... -From 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.. -Why are you filming there? From 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.? Why is the gentleman filming there? It's an interview. An interview outside the embassy? Who is he interviewing? -Me. -You? -Yes, sir. -Alright. Yeah, I can't imagine the Cuban consul's face when Bill went to him with high-tech information. I remember that at the company I worked for in 1986... they paid 15,000 dollars for the first PC and there were only two in the whole bank. "These poor people need help." "Maybe I can help them with electronics or something." That's what he told me. So we sat there and I told him right away that I'm an Argentine and I work in the United States and that I came to give technology to the Cuban government. I tried to imagine what he was thinking later on and I thought, "What must he have thought?" He must have seen a blond guy there, who looked like an American. He must have thought I was there for a business transaction. That's what I thought. -"What do you do in the USA?" -"I'm an engineer." -"And how much money do you make?" -"I make 65,000 dollars a year." "And he's blond, with blue eyes and speaks English perfectly well... and he has a family. We don't believe him. It's hard to believe that someone in your position would do this for ideological reasons." So I left. And I was sure that they would contact me. And I waited. And I waited longer and longer... A year and a half went by and they never contacted me. So I started over. That time I went to the Czchecoslovakian embassy, which was in Washington. We went to Washington on vacation because I had lost a baby and I was kind of depressed. I told her, "We'll go on a trip. We'll have a honeymoon." And when we got to Washington, I hadn't told her anything, I said, "Now that I'm here, I also came for another reason." The section of Cuban government interests was in the Czechoslovakian embassy at that time. CZECHOSLOVAKIAN EMBASSY CUBAN GOVERNMENT INTERESTS I remember I stayed in the car. I didn't go inside. He went inside alone. And I was really nervous. So I opened the trunk and took out all the material. I rang the doorbell at the embassy. And a Czechoslovakian man answered. They saw that I was blond and thought I was Czechoslovakian. He started talking in his language and I didn't understand. So I said in English, "I came to the section of Cuban interests." He was surprised, as if he was thinking: "This blondie wants to see the Cubans? What is he doing here?" Well, I saw Álvaro and started to explain integrated circuits to him. I gave him a small presentation. I showed him some wafers and the integrated circuit and the guy looked at all that and he liked it too, but I thought it was going to be like the other time. I thought maybe later he wouldn't do anything about what I was proposing. They said they'd get in touch with him. I don't remember his exact words, but I think he said "He said they'll call me." And I said to myself, "Good luck. I hope they never call him." 1986 JANUARY TUESDAY 14 One rainy night, like a night in a detective story... someone rang the doorbell, and there was a guy there... wearing glasses. He looked like the singer Piero. Are you Guillermo Gaede? No one knew me as Guillermo. No one knew me as Guillermo in the United States. And I thought, "Who's this guy?" And I thought it was from Immigration. I don't know why. They were the only people who could call me Guillermo. So to make time, I didn't want to say yes or no, I said, "And who are you?" "I come on behalf of the Cuban government." The microelectronics industry is essential for... technological independence. Cameras... watches and tablets, of course, elevators... All of that is controlled by a microprocessor. This chip comes from this wafer where I have integrated circuits. How many? There are thousands here in this wafer. In industrial processes, the hardest thing is to know how something was made, not so much the final product, but how they made it. Difficulties always arise in the small details, which is where state-of-the-art technology, which is always on the cutting edge, fails in the industrialization process. I take the circuit on paper to a set of masks and use photolithography to transfer it to my substrate, which is silicon. It takes 25 or 35 masks to make an integrated circuit and the masks are very expensive. They cost over a million dollars. Two thirds of the value of an integrated circuit is in the design. Maybe he was perfect for the role, because people think spies are like those you see in the movies. And I would have never thought that he would send any information anywhere. Let's say... He looked like a naive person. I mean, like... He would have never made a decision like that. I said no, out of fear or something else, I didn't want to get involved in that mess. As an engineer, I wasn't responsible for the material. So I had to go there and say, "I need 25 wafers." They generally came in packs of 25. "Because I'm making an experiment." So what I did was take those wafers and tell an operator: "Can you put that image on this level? I need this to study particles or whatever." And they did it for me. They did all the work for me. I would tell them on a card, what I wanted them to do, and they would do it, they'd return the wafer to me and I'd have the image. So I would give it to the Cubans. So I had the information on how to make each level, each mask. In the 1980s and 90s, Russia had started... its technological decline because of its economic problems. Their resources were beginning to decline and the United States' advantage was that the issue was in private hands. Private companies were competing among themselves for the market so that pushed them to develop a technology that was superior to that of the Soviet state. It was just a few years before the fall of the Berlin Wall. And things were starting to disintegrate and all possible foreign help was welcome. I think the companies didn't even know. What I had access to were the manuals on how to make the machines required to make integrated circuits. They sell the machines to MDA. MDA buys them and they send MDA the manual, because the technicians need to fix it and maintain them. The manuals always tell you what you have to do and what you don't have to do because they damage the process. And from that information on what do to and what not to do you can get important information. Those manuals were possibly public information. The important thing was to put those manuals in the context of the process. They could be useful, but they require technicians that know the process well. For example, in my crazy head, I thought, "If the Russians have access to these machines, they can improve their machines." Technologically, they were ten years behind the American machines. I don't know if you can see all the dots there. This is only one die and some wafers had up to one thousand dice per wafer. So maybe the most important thing that Bill gave them were those small details on how to make them. The Cuban CIA, which would be the SIDE here in Argentina, made 20 passports for him. And he came out of the room, threw them on the table and said, "Which one do you want me to use?" This is one of... You could call them low-tech devices though they are very useful and was given to me by the Cubans. It's a folder that can be taken apart easily. At first sight it seems like a regular folder. What it allows you to do is remove the screw, very easily... That's it... I'm going to remove this screw. The screw is out... I take it... and this part comes off. And here there's a pocket on both sides, one here... and another one on this side... and so you can put something, like a wafer, in this hole. You put it back and you could take the wafer out of the company. They were all fake passports, all made by the Cuban agency that had different pictures of him... It was obvious that it was him. Some were new, others old, some more worn out than others, stamped as if he had traveled with those passports around the world... He had all the passports ready. He left with one and entered another country with another one. This jacket was made for me by the Cubans. It has a pocket here. I would put something there, close it with the Velcro and this part would be completely straight and no one would suspect anything. So I could put material here and I could get through security. It was a game to him. It was really a game. We've asked him many times, "Now, at this age, would you do it again?" And he'd say "Yes." So in February or March... I think it was in March... We traveled to Mexico. I was supposed to travel alone, but since my wife was involved and in a way she knew everything, she said, "I won't let you go alone because they might kill you. I'm going with you." I was his bodyguard. They agreed that it would be better for the Cuban to go near the border and we would cross the border and meet there. Crossing the border was no big deal on the Mexican side. The problem was always getting back in. Because since so many illegal immigrants crossed the border you had to give a certain image, and the image of a family was much better than the image of just one person. The trunk was full of material. They were generally two boxes. I had a good idea of what they could need, but there were two worlds, the Soviet world, which needed more advanced technology, and the Cuban world, which I knew didn't need... such advanced technology. I gave him the 286, the 386 and the 486. Just telling them, "You use these techniques to deposit the film and this is the equipment, the list of inputs..." That closes the gap quite a lot. It saves a lot of time. I think that, up until that point, Fidel didn't know who I was. He was aware that there was a married couple there that was helping the Cuban revolution selflessly, not out of self interest, and that the exchange had had tangible results, at least with the Russians, so he said "I should meet these people." How did a married couple go there and offer their services? What were the characteristics to determine whether or not they were trustworthy? The problem is that the information he was giving was so important that when the Russian experts got it... This was given to Saddam Hussein to North Korea, to Germany... There were a lot of people behind that information. In some cases it was sold, so they confirmed that it was information that the Americans would not sacrifice, especially not from a private company like AMD. STATE SECRET HAVANA, OCTOBER 13 The letter says "With regard to the AMD information, we are submitting to you a large package that contains 2,526 documents, with a total of 62,618 pages. We were invited. Those people invited us. I didn't really feel like going. "Fidel wants to meet you." "Fidel wants to meet you." CUBAN EMBASSY - VISA APPLICATION REJECTED I got there on December 31, 1989. January 1 is the anniversary of the revolution. January 1, 1959 is when Batista was overthrown by Fidel. And it's the New Year that people celebrate all over the world. I thought, "They'll celebrate the revolution. It's going to be a big celebration. Everyone will be dancing candombe on the street." And there was none of that. A total funeral. Everything was dark. There were no lights, no music. Nothing, nothing at all. It was as if it were any other day. I don't think this is what they led others to believe. It's a farce, a facade. It's a farce. It's not the socialism you think it is, the humanist, human-centered socialism. Everyone gets by as best as they can. So then you start to think that it's no use. -This is Cienfuegos.... -Cienfuegos? This looks like it was burned down. And I let the Cubans know that I didn't like what I saw. I didn't say it so directly. I kind of said it jokingly. But I let them know that we didn't think it was something worth fighting for. And I think they realized that and maybe that was why Fidel Castro didn't meet with us. And their Ministry of Interior, their secret service, decided to change their strategy and use us for other purposes. An incredible story. They went to Cuba and I met them, we worked together. I showed them what Cuba was really like. And they found out that they had made a big mistake in their lives. In your case, what made you change your mind? Because I saw, I discovered, Ninoska, the criminal nature of the regime. Starting to work in the intelligence service became a double-edged sword. Because they can't censor information there and I started to discover what the real revolution was. I think I was 38 years old... Yes, 38 and he was 28. And he was a lieutenant of the Cuban secret service, the G2. The betrayal, to put it one way, we'll call it "betrayal" for argumentative reasons... occurred two years later. In 1992, we saw Pepe and the government designated him again as our chaperone. And when these people went to Cuba, I told them, "You don't know what it's like. I'm going to risk my life to show it to you." And since I had to organize their itinerary in Cuba for 15 days, they found out what Cuba was really like. And I took them to see the most unlikely places of the old Havana, where the brothels are, the poor places, where children have parasites. I said, "Is this the socialism you're defending?" He took care of us, because he knew us well so they designated him. Pepe was left alone with us. And so Pepe took the opportunity to tell us his views. He said, "I've changed my mind. I've switched to the other side." "You're working for a tyrant." "You're crazy," he said. "No, you're crazy for sacrificing your family, sacrificing your kids, a high level job, where you make 100,000, 200,000 dollars a year, as an executive, sacrificing your future." If I'm young, and I'm thinking about leaving, how could you sacrifice your entire life? And thank God that man never betrayed me. He did what I asked him to do. And until that point, he had served the "revolution." I couldn't quit. First of all, I couldn't do it. You don't realize at first, but when you get involved in something like that, the only way to get out of it is by dying. There's no other way. Disappearing? Saying "I don't want to have anything to do with this"? What about all the information I gave? I don't know if that can be covered up. So they started telling him about the CIA and that the CIA could help to overthrow Castro and Billy agreed right away. So Pepe introduced us to Rolando Sarraff Trujillo. We met him for the first time. But since they were friends from high school, he said, "He's a high school friend of mine. One day we confessed to each other, we trusted each other enough to confess to each other that we didn't agree with what was going on in Cuba." and they told my wife and me that they would give us information. And they gave us information. But then they said, "We want you to go to the CIA. Go to the CIA with this information." To overthrow Fidel, I guess. That was the idea. And my wife almost killed me. She said, "Don't even think about it. You guys are insane. We're not going to the CIA. Forget about that. They'll put us in jail and ruin our lives." And Pepe insisted and said, "No, don't worry. If you go to the CIA, they'll accept you and they'll work with you." Overthrow the government to change all that. Billy didn't agree with that anymore... Not anymore. The CIA would overlook what we had done, but the chance to penetrate the Cuban intelligence service was very valuable to them. That's why he decided to go and I didn't want to have anything to do with that. I said, "Now you really are teaming up with the worst. Now you really are." I was so mad! How could we do that? It's like going to the police and saying "I robbed the bank. Put me in jail." It was kind of like that. An agent of theirs came out, about 50 years old, with his hand on his gun. I slowly raised my hands. AUGUST 1992 And he came up to me and checked if I had any weapons. But he checked very superficially and I was taking a big risk, because I had a recorder on me. I had a small recorder. To him it was still a game. The one who most suffered was his wife with the kids. He didn't. To him it was fun. I wanted to document it. I went inside the CIA office with a recorder because I wanted to document the fact that I went to the CIA and I also wanted to retain any information that came up in the conversation. You can't retain everything. I have a list on the left-hand side. It's the names of the agents I snitched on. And on the right are the names I wasn't supposed to give out until the US government decided to work with us. 16 guys, 20 names or whatever. I don't know who they are. It's like saying "These are they guys helping Fidel Castro." It's as if it was an army, and you're fighting against that army. I don't care. So there was a problem. I was worried that one day they would put me in jail. "About your immunity, we've had cases like this before. It has to go to the D.A. and the Department of Justice has to get involved." They told us a long story and essentially said, "We can't guarantee you anything." And that made us a bit nervous. Because we thought, "I told them everything... I told them everything." And they said, "We'll see if we give you immunity." Two enemies. I'm helping these people and they won't guarantee anything and now I can't get near Cuba or I'll get shot. So Billy realized... that it wasn't working anymore. And we decided to escape. SEPTEMBER 6 I cried, I cried that night, because I said, "How are we going to leave all our stuff behind?" And he said, "It doesn't matter," because Billy doesn't really care about material things. We were with all the kids and we were on the road for eight months with the FBI looking for us. SEPTEMBER 1992 HEAD OF SECURITY AMD They knew that the FBI was working with me or that I was in touch with the FBI. The FBI told AMD... They told me this later, they had no other choice but to tell AMD that for years I had been taking information from AMD, sending it to Cuba and through Cuba to the Soviet Bloc. So AMD wanted to know where I was. They wanted to talk directly to me, without FBI intervention and the FBI wouldn't tell them where I was. So AMD put up a wanted poster, like in the Old West. They put up a poster at the semiconductor association of California, which was really big, really important. And Intel belongs to that association too. I went from here to there for several months, from Texas to California and back. While I was on the road I took a recorder with me with what is called a "pickup cable." I would go to the phone, connect the pickup cable, dial the number... and the FBI would answer... FBI. So I would talk and tape it. Let's turn ourselves in. Let's come out of hiding and turn ourselves into the FBI. And there was another problem. They didn't believe us. "What do you mean you don't believe us? Didn't I give you good information?" "Very good." "So what's the problem?" "We believe you. But we don't believe Pepe." They ended up convincing me that Pepe was lying. That he was working for Fidel Castro. I couldn't believe it. It was a brutal blow. I started crying. I started crying that day. I couldn't believe that this guy that I was helping had been deceiving me for the past four years. The Cuban Ministry of Interior used him to send information to the CIA through me. The information that I was giving them was very good, except for a few details. Some of the information was very bad and the Cuban government wanted the CIA to believe that information. It was a trap they had set up for the CIA through me and they were using Pepe as a channel for that. One of my goals was to get revenge on those people. I wanted revenge and to find out the truth. From what he told me, at one point, they turned their back on him and tried to destroy him. So he defended himself. He didn't believe anyone anymore, so he said, "I'm going to start recording these people" and he did. I was always worried about working with federal agencies so I always took my precautions. I filmed them, I recorded them and took their fingerprints. NOVEMBER 24, 1993 "OVEN-CAM" Billy is unbelievable. How could he think of putting...? I would see the camera in the oven and laugh. How did he come up with that? He comes up with the strangest things... FBI AGENT PAYING TRAVEL ALLOWANCES The FBI now wanted to use us in a counterespionage operation. They wanted to intercept calls or messengers from Cuba who wanted to contact me. In order to do it, we had to give them something. What was I going to give them if I wasn't working for AMD anymore? Intel was the first company to produce integrated circuits, a competitor of AMD. So leaving AMD after having sent all that technology to Cuba, given it to the Soviet government and now going to work for Intel with the FBI's knowledge was almost a crime, but not for me, for the FBI. I don't know. These were important companies, working with that level of technology and the guys hired people without even finding out about their background to know if they had been identified as a spy, like in his case. It seems suspicious that they didn't conduct a proper investigation, but I don't know if at that time there were many tools and information available to investigate someone. SEPTEMBER 9 What information could be given that wouldn't be a concern? That wouldn't affect Intel? They asked me in writing. I have it in writing. He sent me a fax that said... So the FBI gave him their blessing. "Do this, take that, send that. This is publicly known, you can send it..." But Intel didn't know anything about this. Intel had no idea what was going on. So one day I took what was called the run card which is the list of necessary operations to produce an integrated circuit. So I took two pieces of paper and I kept one. I had the other one there. And I said, "This is a run card. It's Intel technology. It's the C 6295." And I let him pick it up and touch it with his fingers. So he touched it, looked at it and said, "It's very good." And at one point he left. I think to the bathroom... And then I switched it. Because what I wanted were his fingerprints on an Intel run card, to show that they had touched Intel technology. So the Head of Security at Intel was a former FBI agent named Steve Lund. And Steve Lund saw the Wanted poster that said that AMD was looking for this guy and he decided to investigate to see if he could find him. And Steve Lund finds out that he was working for Intel in Chandler, Arizona. And he said, "This guy is working for me now?" AMD said something to them. "Be careful with this guy," or something like that. So the head of security at Intel wanted to talk to him. So what Steve Lund did was contact the FBI. "Yes, look, we're found Bill Gaede who's working in Chandler." And they said, "Yes, we know." What could the FBI say? "Yes, we know." And the FBI contacted me right away. They said, "Intel knows. Don't say anything. Tell them you're cooperating with a counterespionage operation by the FBI and you can't say anything." So Billy said, "This is not right either." So I knew that there was going to be trouble, that the FBI was washing its hands of the situation so everything I had done till then came in handy. The finger prints, the filmed material, the recordings really came in handy. But now what was I going to do with Intel? If they fired me, it would be unfair, because I hadn't done anything against Intel until then. "I'm going to cover myself just in case, because something could happen and I have to be sure, because they won't give me guarantees so I'm going to have my own guarantee." Part of my job was at the help desk and I had to be available 24/7. So they installed a computer at my house, a telephone, everything. I had all the devices. That's what I call a modern slave. If there was an issue at 2:00 a.m. or 3:00 a.m. someone would call and say, "Bill, help me." So what I did from my house was entering Intel's database in Albuquerque. And there I found the Pentium, all the specifications. Pentium is the most advanced integrated circuit in the world. At that time it was produced by Intel and they had given me access about one week before. If I had downloaded them, all of the alarms would've went off. Intel security would've said, "What are you doing?" So I didn't do that. What I did was display them on the screen and film them with my camera. My wife said I was crazy. She would say, "What are you filming?" And I would say, "Nothing, I'm filming Intel's specifications." "Nice!" I made three VHS cassettes with all of Intel's technology. That was very bold. Remember he didn't have a cell phone with a camera. He set up a device to capture images, he used his own resources to avoid being investigated by the company. So they called me over. They called me to fire me. They took away my ID, and said, "You're fired." They didn't say "You're suspended." They fired me. And so I said, "They had no reason to fire me. I'm going to get revenge." And I said, "I'm going to give this technology to the Chinese and to Iran." Hello. What's up? How are you? Guillermo. He came to live at my house and he never told us anything about his life. All we knew was that he went to work and came back. If you're gonna do it, it has to be an enemy of the USA. CHINESE EMBASSY At one point, he told us that he had gone to the embassies. I stole technology that was worth 20 million dollars. If you have technology worth 20 million, for how much would you sell it to China? Anyone would say "At least for one million, half a million, for sure. A hundred thousand dollars." I went to those embassies and sold it to each of them for five thousand dollars. I didn't intent to become a millionaire with that. My intention was mostly to get revenge. My reasons were always ideological. But I wasn't going to go to the Iranian embassy and say: "Now I'm a Muslim and I'm doing this for Allah." So he didn't give very many details. At least once I realized that he was lying. He said he hadn't received anything in exchange. And he told Osvaldo that they paid him 50 thousand dollars. What? He never told me that, ever. And if he had told me that and I had been here at the time, he wouldn't have gone or else he would've been in trouble. The Iranians sent over two different guys. The Chinese one was always the same guy. I guess he was an electronics engineer. We communicated in English. We would come here, to Banchero, we would eat, and I would show them... I trained them to use the material I was giving them. They had three cassettes containing Intel technology. We mostly found out about everything when they caught him at Ezeiza. We stopped a suspect trying to bury some bags. Here in Ezeiza. "Guillermo, you son of a bitch. You can't imagine how worried I was. Bastard!" When you see him, you realize that he's not crazy. PROSECUTOR CYBERCRIMES We could have him tested by a doctor and they would say, "No, he's not lying" right away. So it was hard to keep him in custody. Because I didn't find him with anything. He told me the whole story. I had to try to figure out how plausible his story was and its relationship with the things we confiscated, the videos, the minichips, the magazines, the clippings, everything he had. The SIDE intervened and they contacted the CIA in the States. Two days later, Billy showed up here, happy. The police car had brought him here. They brought him with all this stuff. As if nothing had happened. But he kept doing his thing, because he said, "Look, if people from the SIDE come here..." What Billy wanted was for them to get out of the car. Get out of the car, ring the doorbell and wait. Then he could film them and he showed her how to do it and then he would go out. He said, "I have a recorder. Where can I put it to record what they tell me?" I said, "That's easy. I'll sew a pocket in your underwear. And you'll handle it when you're talking to them." What's up? How are you? OCTOBER 12 Were you looking for the house? Yeah, we had trouble with that. Why? You couldn't find it? First we couldn't find it, then we got a flat tire... And on top of that... -What's up? How's it going? -Alright. Let me introduce you... What's up? How are you? Nice to meet you. -Claudio. -Claudio? -How are you? -Fine, fine. The people from the SIDE took me from my brother's house to the Hyatt Hotel on October 11. HYATT HOTEL No one has to find out. No one in the entire world. All I'm saying is that if you tell anyone, consider yourself behind bars. We went to the backyard and he was burning garbage in the grill. And he cracked the grill, the ceramic tiles came off. He was burning documentation. Because they were following me. Obviously these people were following me. The people from the SIDE were with me at all times. They made me nervous. So I went to the US press. I wanted to tell the press because I was afraid that the CIA would do something to me. And I ended up going to the New York Times and I talked to their representative here in Buenos Aires, who is Calvin Sims. JOURNALIST He heard my whole story but he didn't believe me. I told Calvin Sims that the Head of Intelligence at Intel was going to come to Buenos Aires and he said, "The Head if Intelligence at Intel is coming to Buenos Aires?" and I said, "Yes, exactly." And he said, "Your story is very hard to believe." I suffer from the Cassandra syndrome. No one believes me. No matter what I say, no one believes me. So I can't make people believe me. All I can do is tell my side of the story and let people believe whatever they want. MAY 14 SHERATON HOTEL HEAD OF SECURITY AT INTEL AN ARGENTINE CONFESSED HE WAS A SPY They published the article, so the case became known and I didn't notice anything anymore. I thought I had covered myself with that and that I was safe. Don't you realize it's a game? I told you so. Why do you get involved in that stuff? You made your bed, now lie in it. He made a comment about that at one point. He said he was more scared of the Cubans than the Americans, because the Americans would put him in jail at most. "But the Cubans," he said, "will kill you." He ultimately decided to go back there, because they told him they just wanted to talk to him and clear things up and that they wouldn't do anything to him, that they would just give him a slap on the wrist. Even I was silly enough to believe it. And I went straight to the United States. I went straight into the lion's den. Bastards! SEPTEMBER 23 They put me on trial. This is what they said happened: That I sent a package from Argentina containing three cassettes to AMD. That's the official version. That was sent to them by the CIA. If I'm going to ask them for money, I'm not going to send them the cassettes first and then say, "Send me the check." And there was a press conference because the first thing the FBI said when I got arrested was, "We don't know. We have a guy here that we caught, we investigated him and found out he's a spy." I already knew that when the FBI went to trial they deny everything and say, "We don't know him." That was what was going to happen. They were going to deny knowing me. But I had proof against them: The recordings of the CIA in Buenos Aires... You can't deny a recording. And I hadn't cashed the checks, so I had their handwriting on it. They'd give me dollar bills and I wouldn't put them in the bank. I would put them in a bag with their fingerprints on them. I had them on film, I had a lot of material against them. Since the D.A. knew this, they not only wanted to put me in jail, but the FBI agents as well. The last thing they wanted was to go to trial. At that time, US law had no foresight... We're talking about 1995 or 1996... They had no foresight when it came to intangible assets. What happened was that information was copied. I can't steal information, I can copy it. That's the right word. We can steal tangible assets and copy intangible assets. More than one person can watch the same TV show, more than one person can read the same book at the same time. You can't do that with a shoe, a chair or a house. They were applying a law against theft and there was no theft. What I did was copy. But they couldn't put me in jail because it wasn't a criminal offense. Until my case, that is. Now it is a criminal offense. "An Argentine stole computer technology in the US and sold it to Iran, Cuba and China. From engineer to thief." I think he got the chance to do it because... he could, because he wanted to and the security regulations were less strict. After that, these companies now have stricter security measures. But thieves are very clever. It really sounds incredible, like something out of Get Smart. Because I see Guillermo Gaede in an environment of people like him... Because it's also hard to imagine, after having seen so many spy movies, that Americans can be so... stupid. I don't think he's learned anything. If he gets the chance... As they say "Opportunity makes the thief." If he gets the chance, he'll do it again. They started an investigation against my wife. They threatened to put her in jail and we reached an agreement by which they would leave my wife alone if I declared myself guilty. And that was the agreement. GAEDE PLEADED GUILTY AND WAS SENTENCED TO ONLY 33 MONTHS IN PRISON. IN 1996 THE US CONGRESS PASSED THE ECONOMIC ESPIONAGE ACT. THE "GAEDE CASE" WAS CITED AS A PRECEDENT IN THE CONGRESSIONAL DEBATE ON THE LAW. IN PRISON, GAEDE DEDICATED HIS TIME TO HELPING OTHER PRISONERS WITH THEIR SENTENCES. HE WAS KNOWN AS "CRAZY CHE." JOSE COHEN HAS DENIED HAVING SENT GAEDE TO THE CIA UNDER THE ORDERS OF FIDEL CASTRO. IN 1994 HE IS BELIEVED TO HAVE ESCAPED FROM CUBA ON A RAFT TO MIAMI, UNITED STATES. SINCE THEN, HE IS SAID TO BE WORKING AS A SUCCESSFUL SALESMAN. IN 1995 ROLANDO SARRAF TRUJILLO WAS ACCUSED OF ESPIONAGE AND JAILED IN CUBA FOR OVER 20 YEARS. IN DECEMBER, 2014 HE WAS FREED AFTER A HISTORIC PACT WAS SIGNED BETWEEN CUBA AND THE USA He was writing a book that he wanted to submit to a producer in the United States to make a movie out of it and he wanted Harrison Ford to play him, in the movie. Yes, because it's incredible. SON The story is like if someone said that your dad was on the moon or something. It's hard to believe. He was a spy and all other people's dads are policemen or something normal and he was a spy and now he's a crazy physicist, so... It's crazy... So he's still doing that today, that stuff with the rope. SALZBURG, AUSTRIA 2014 SECOND RATIONAL PHYSICS CONFERENCE AFTER SERVING HIS SENTENCE, GAEDE WAS DEPORTED FROM THE USA HE CURRENTLY LIVES IN GERMANY WHERE HE WORKS AS A SCIENTIST PROMOTING THE THEORY CALLED "ROPE HYPOTHESIS" WITH WHICH HE TRIES TO EXPLAIN THE UNIVERSE.
