- Anything? - Looks a bit treacherous. I think we should keep on moving. - Oh, come on. Where's the daredevil in you, huh? Let's document it. I can take a few shots. This is amazing! If what they're saying on the news is correct, this could be the biggest natural disaster in history. In a matter of days. - That's why we've gotta get out of dodge. - Come on, what's a few photos? I mean, they just said it might happen in a few days. - Yeah, and I bet that's what they said at Pompeii too. - All right, come on, let's go. - There's no signal. We better get back to the car where it's safe. - Ooh, whoa! Oh. Oh shit! - What is it? Crap! - Run! - Go, go, go! I thought you said it wasn't supposed to pick up so fast? - Everything said it wouldn't. I just don't get it. It's not starting. - Right, come on! - Get out. Get out now! - It won't open! It won't open! I can't get out! I can't get out! I can't get out! - Shit. Linda, no! Linda! The lightning storm last night has been described as a mega storm. Dr. Becker, a researcher at the NSSL, warns that these storms could become more commonplace in the wake of global warming. Some of his working theories on these storms from research of similar in Iceland have so far been dismissed by rival experts. Another storm has been forecast in the coming days. The previous one was far more aggressive than experts had believed. Two people have been reported dead. Dr. Becker warns that further storms could prove unpredictable and potentially a severe threat to life. - Come on, come on, answer. - Sorry. - Oh my God. You scared the crap out of me. - Didn't mean to startle you. - Oh, I just think it's this storm. It's gotten me a little shaky. And I seem to have something wrong with my car, and I can't get ahold of my husband to come out here and fix it. - I could take a look. - I don't wanna trouble you. You know, I just live about 10 minutes up the road. It's just that I can't seem to get ahold of my husband to come out here and save me. - What's the matter? Were there devils here? Hey, how about I drop you off on my way home? How about that? - Oh, you know, that's okay. I appreciate the offer, but no thank you. - Well, if it's only 10 minutes away, it's no problem. - Yeah, you know what? I'm just gonna wait for my husband. I'm gonna try and give him a call again, actually. Thank you though. - Are you sure? - Yeah, thank you. - Okay, okay. - The air breathes of honesty and most sweetly. - You have a good time? - Yeah, thanks. - Maybe we'll go out again some other time. - You know, I actually, I had fun. I'm not usually... Well, usually not into the adventuring style. - Yeah, well that's why we practice indoors. Take it outdoors and then we'll scale over it. - Shut up. - Yeah, we've gotta stay away from the mountains near Rough Rock Lake though. Did you hear about that fellow getting vaporized by lightning? - Yeah, I read about that. - That'll shocking. - Stop it, that's awful. - Anyways, you and your sister will be able to host tomorrow? - Yeah, and well I text Sally and Donal, they're coming. And Michael And Charlie can't make it. - Well, Charlie's a twat. There's no loss there. - Yeah, my parents will be leaving I think early afternoon, so I'll text you. - Well, me and Paulie will sort out booze. What do you like? - Don't do anything too strong. - Girls' drink. - Right, it's 2022. You can't say things like that, you pig. - Well, what do you want then? - Something fruity or like G and T. - You mean like a girl's drink? - Right, if I didn't like you so much, I'd cut your balls off. - Well. - Not. Not here. Not in the car, like just get that out of your head. - You're getting me so worked up. - Not when my parents are 30 yards away. - Yeah. You want the moment to be worth it. - Yeah. Thank you. - For what? - For being patient and... - No, don't be silly, it's fine. Go home, have a cold shower, sort myself out. - You're fed up with me. - Look, I don't... Despite what Paulie might say about me, I'm not a player, all right? - Okay. - I'm in there for the long haul. I don't wanna ruin this by rushing it. You should go inside. - Yeah, okay. I'll see you tomorrow. Hey. - And we'll keep it PG-13. - Okay, bye. - All right. Kiddo? - Dad, did you feel that? - Yeah, they said on the news to expect some heavy thunder. They've even told us the warning stay indoors. It's a load of crock, isn't it? Who was in the car? - Spanish Inquisition? - No, it's Mastermind, Dad's edition. So? - Just a friend, whatever. - Mm. How was uni then? - Yeah, it's good. Looks all right. - Look, when your mother and I go on this weekend, we don't want any shenanigans. - Shouldn't it be you two I'm worried about causing the shenanigans? - No, well, but we've got plenty of experience, haven't we? And we pay the bills. I don't wanna come back here and find this place trashed. - Okay. What are you reading? - Oh, it's a report on the lightning the other day. Says that we could be getting in for more occurrences, sometimes even more dangerous. Some crackpot in here says that he thinks the lightning is tuned to the electric current in the human body. - Should you even be going away then? If it's that dangerous? Why can't you just stay here? - Look, your mother will lose her shit if we don't go away. We booked this trip ages ago. It's a fairly safe journey, and it's only two hours on the motorway. - I know, I just don't want you going, and then the roads are gonna be closed, and then you can't find a way back if something happens. - Your mother's not gonna complain if we get stuck in the resort. - Okay. Just drive safe. - Oh, Man United lost. - Dad, you know we have the internet. I could have told you that last night. - Isn't it passed your bedtime? - What time is it? - 10:30. - 10:30. Yeah, I'm not 12 anymore, Dad, seriously. - Avante. - Love you. - Love you too. - Bye. - Bye, love. - Thou hast now to wait 12 winters. Don't you realize no one's coming for you? This is your life now. They've already stopped talking about you on the news. All they're talking about is this lightning, and how everyone has to stay indoors. They didn't even mention you. Temper and his wizard, delicate wench. - You've used all the milk. Can I have your yogurt then? - Don't look at me. - Oh, you're such a dickhead. One of them, but you owe me another. - Yeah, I'll get you a luxurious one with gold sprinkles on top. - Sounds good. - That is rank. It's out of date. - Why do you think I'm having cereal? - Oh my God, asshole. - Come, you all set for later? - Yeah. - Okay, the boys are definitely coming. Is Sally and her boyfriend still coming? - Yes. - And what about... - Oh yeah, Paulie and Sean said they were gonna do a booze run. - Okay, okay. Well, as long as they're not getting any cheap cider like in college. - No, I told him to get G and T, obviously. Good. - Are you two contemplating how much is it gonna cost me? - Nothing, Mom. - I know what you two are like. What are you scheming? - No, I just, I think we're gonna watch some films with Sally, aren't we? She's gonna be around. What movie? - It's like a disaster movie about fire tornadoes. - You know, when I was your age, we'd usually have to be drunk before we could watch a silly movie about a killer doll. Then we scared ourselves so much that we couldn't sleep. Creepy dolls are so the early noughties. - Who's had all the milk? - Dad. - Dad. - Black tea it is then. When we're gone, right, no boys, no parties, no boozing, but for a couple of beers in the fridge, and that's your limit, ladies. - Okay. - Okay. - Thanks, Mom. She still thinks we're kids, doesn't she? - But don't tell her because she'll parent. - Kiss a slice? Right, please tell me that your mother's ready. - No. - Ngh-ngh. - Look, I wanna get away soon. I wanna get off before those bloody storm clouds come in. So what are you two doing today? - Just movies with Sally. - Look, get yourselves some drinks or something, aye, girls? Have a nice time. - Oh. - Bye. - Bye. All right, that should get us an extra couple of bottles. - You know, he's still working on 1980s time. Probably could buy a house with that. Thank you. - Hey, what are you doing? - That's what you get for being a milk thief. - Right, so Mom and Dad will be gone in a couple of hours, and then we need to get ready 'cause then the boys are coming. Hey, what is it? - Nothing. It's... It's just like Sean stuff. - Right, well, you don't need to feel any pressure, right? It doesn't have to be this weekend. - I know. It's just with everything that happened with my ex and stuff. I just, I don't want him to get like put off me or anything. - Look, if he does, he's not worth it, right? But I don't think he will. - Okay. - Besides he can take care of himself for the time being. Choke his chicken to his heart's content. - That's grim. It is a bit. - I must have missed it. I think it might rain soon, you know. Did you hear about the thunder om the news? - Yeah, that's why we're going to Meg's for the weekend. We'll be fine here until the bus comes. - Yeah, but how long? - An hour. - I know, we'll get an early start. Promise me something. - What? - No silly, drunken dancing. - When have I ever drunken danced? - Uh, my sister's wedding, prom. Literally every single night at student union. - Okay, fine, point taken. - Thunder really freaks me out. - Bloody hell, love. You turn the water mains off before you pulled the sink out? - Very funny, could you help? - Don't worry, girls. We'll be back. Even though your mum's packing off for a migration. - Yeah, you paid the mortgage off though, aren't you? We'll be fine. - Did you hear that, Di? That's our little 'un that is. - Dad, I'm not a kid! Oh, you'll always be my baby. - Okay. - If there's anything you need, all right, I've got this. My fifth limb. So don't be thinking that you can't call. I can hunt you down all over the country. - I'll see you, Mom. - Bye, Mom. - Bye, Meg. - Love you. Bye, Dad. - Bye, Dad! - See ya! - Bye. I wanna beat this storm front. - Bye! - Bye! - All right, so I reckon we get some drinks, and we start getting ready. Sally and Donal are running late, missed the bus. - Oh forgive me my sins. Shit. Awake, dear heart, awake. Thou hast slept well. - Help me, help me, somebody help me! - Silence, one more word and I will chide thee! Lie there, mine heart. Wipe thine eyes. Have comfort. You will behave tonight. - Please, just let me go. I won't tell anybody, I promise. - Just a few more days, then I'll set you free. - Why are you doing this? Because I can. - Please. - No one's gonna stop me. - Please just let me go, I'm begging you. - Well demanded, wench. I want to show you something. It's very special. For your eyes only. - Who are these girls? How, how could you do that? - It was quite simple. Strangely therapeutic. It takes great patience to do my work. To put a cut precisely where it needs to be. - You're a fucking maniac. - Afternoon, girls. - Hey. - Hey. Hi, how are you? - You two took your time. - Yeah, well, we were circling around, waiting for a green light. Look what we got. - Sally and her boyfriend are running late. They couldn't catch the bus, so. - You didn't tell me we was hanging around with those two, did we? What do you think, they good? - Yeah, thanks. - Well. - Thank you. - Here's to a delightful weekend in the country. - Cheers. - Cheers. - So when are Donal and Sally actually gonna get here? - You know what, I don't even know. My phone's been lighting up as well so. Can't even get a hold of them. - Why did you park so far away? - It's easier to get out. - Sean can't parallel park. He'll hit anything and everything he can. Cars, bikes, people, small children. - Yeah, laugh it up, dickhead. How you getting home? - All right, children, stop it. - Right, I'd like to propose a proper toast. To loved ones and good times. And to Meg. - No, what? - No, seriously, even though you're the youngest, you're the the most grounded. Okay. - Cheers. - Cheers. - So you got a jacuzzi? - Yeah, why? - You fancy a dip? - Okay. - Ugh, no signal. - Probably because we're in the middle of nowhere, Donal. - Maybe the storm's messing with the connection. - Jesus, those clouds are getting really close. Do you think we're safe here? - I could feel that one. - I'm scared. - Sure it's nothing to worry about. - Are you crazy? - What? - We have to run, run! - Wait! - What? - I need to tell you something. - Donal? - What time can we check in? - Any time we get there, love. - I am excited. - So am I. - But... - What? - You bring the massage oils? Bernie, get your mind out of the gutter. Yes, I did, along with the kitchen sink, you silly sod. I'm slightly worried. That storm seems to be getting aggressive, and it's getting closer. - I think we're safe, love. These modern cars are lightning proof, I think. - Lightning proof? They tell you that on the forecourt, did they? - No, I think I saw it on Top Gear once. - Did you see that? That... - Hope the rain doesn't get any worse. Right-hand wiper doesn't work very well. - I keep telling you to replace it. - I'll get around to it. - How are you enjoying the log cabin in the garden by the way? - What cabin? - The one you said you were going to build five years ago? I think the last update on that was, "I'll get round to it." - You're winding up me now, dear. 25 years and counting, darling. - Hey, sure you're okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah. - Well, you look great. - Thanks. - Hey. - Hmm? Oh, I'm fine. I'm just a bit worried about Donal and Sally 'cause I've not heard from them, like all night. - Well, it may be that their parents are just being strict to them. It's been kind of mad lately, hasn't it? Like all these streets, locking them down. - Yeah, I know, I'm just worried that they're out there. They're stuck in the storm. - Oh shit, that was nearer. - What, you think we should just check the weather report? - No. - What do you think? - I think... I don't think we should be in here. I think we should get out. - Just relax, we're here to have a good time. - Yeah, just relax. Everything will be okay. - What if Donal and Sally are stuck in it? Well, then they're gonna get struck by lightning. - Paulie, that's not funny. Well, it is a little bit. - I'm gonna go and check on them anyway. No signal. - She's just worried about her friends, that's all. - Yeah, but she's making a big thing about going in. - She's not making a big thing, just leave her alone. Oh shit. Oh shit, Meg. Paulie, it's not funny! - Well, it is a little bit. - No, it's not! Are you all right? - Will Mom and Dad be okay? - Yeah. Yeah, they'll be fine, don't be silly. Hey, don't be dramatic now, okay? That's my job, yeah? Fine. - Okay. - Fine. - Should we find cover somewhere? - Where? Look, we're just under an hour away. - It's pretty bad out there. I thought they said it was fine to be out on the roads. - Well, technically they didn't say that. They actually said, "You shouldn't leave your house "unless it's an emergency, "and you were coming in from the East." - Maybe we should turn back. - Look, it's only supposed to get rough in a couple more days. We're almost through this now. - Watch the road, love! Pull up, pull off the road! - Shit! - Watch it! Ah, quick, Bernie! - Babe, we burst a tire! - Quick, just pull up, pull up! We have to move. Did you see what happened back there? Christ almighty. - I think we're by Riley's farm. The house is a couple of fields over. - Okay. - Bloody tire's blown. - Look, the fields are out in the open. It's too dangerous. - The tele says it's better to be out here than under one of these trees or stuck in this tin box. - Could we not just stay in the car? - Look out, Di! - Oh. - Get down. - What the? - Jesus Christ, the car. They shouldn't let anyone leave their houses. - Oh my God, there is no signal! I just want to call the girls. I can't get a signal. - Love, there's a house just... If we get to it first, we can use their phone. Oh come, come on. Come on, love, calm down. It's gonna be all right. You got me. - Yeah. - We're gonna be all right. - Yeah. - Come on. - Okay. - Look, you've always been there. I don't know what these things mean. I forgot my glasses anyway. - Okay, right. Let's get to it. - Quick. It's okay, I've got the map. Look. Come on, Bernie. Bernie, move! No! - It seems to have subsided a little, I think. - Yeah, maybe it's run it's course. Is there anything on the radio, man? - Nothing has changed. Can we just go back in the hot tub now? - I can still see the clouds above. Yeah, I can still see some lightning crackling inside. - Hope Mom and Dad are okay. - There's no phone signals, we're not gonna know anything. Just stop overthinking it, all right? - Hey Meg, they'll be fine. - All right, what do we do? - Why don't we go back out to the jacuzzi and chill the hell out? It's meant to be a party, guys. Bunch of sad sacks. - Hello? Hello? Hello? - Darling, stop freaking out. - Okay. - No, it's fine, I'm here. - Yeah, thanks. Sorry I don't like give you what you want sometimes. It's just, I, like I have to just take it slow. - There's no rushing, right? You know I like you a lot, yeah? Now we're talking. Reports are saying this mega lightning storm is the worst ever recorded. Vehicles and buildings have been destroyed. Old buildings like listed buildings, cottages and farmhouses have been more susceptible to the damage. One house in Meltonville was completely destroyed with lightning causing severe damage and triggering a house fire. Oh my God. It's my Mom. Mom, Mom? Mom? - Meg, I'm fine. All right? I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm... I'm at the windmill cottage, Southeast. - What are you doing there? - There was an accident, on the road. - Mom, are you okay? - I'm fine, I'm fine, all right? I'm still a little shaken. Look, I'll check back in with you later. Are you girls all right? - Yeah, we're fine. Now I'm gonna come, I'm gonna come and get you. - No, it's dangerous. - No, I'm gonna come and get you and Dad now, okay? Send me the address. - Just leave it. Meg, listen to me for once in your life, okay? It is not safe to be out on the roads, all right? I'll call back on you later. - I love you. - Love you too. - Will you take me to go find my mom and dad? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - They've been in an accident and we need to go. - Okay, yeah. - We need to go now. Corin. Corin. Corin, Corin! - What? - Listen to me. Mom and dad have been in an accident, okay? - What? - It's all right, they're fine, but I need you to stay here. Be safe and I'm gonna go get Mom, okay? Just stay there. - Right, okay. - I, what do I say? - Okay, I told her. Can you get the car ready for me please? I don't think we're safe her. I'll go get her. - Hope they're okay. - But in the mean time, we've got the hot tub to ourselves. - I don't know, I feel like I should go check on her. - Oh, it doesn't matter what's going on with your weird sister right now, it's fine. - Don't call her weird. - She's causing a lot of drama tonight. - Yeah, well, she's been through a lot. You don't know half of it, okay? - Well, how would I know what's going on with her, Corin? - Paulie, get out. - It's just the lightning. - Paulie, that's getting close. Paulie, get out now. Paulie, get out of the tub, Paulie! - Hello? Hello? - Paulie? - Paulie! - What is it? - We're gonna die! We're all gonna die! - Corin, look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me. It's okay, it's okay. - Paulie! - No, you need to calm down. Calm down. Calm down, look at me. Calm down. Calm down, okay? Okay, it's gonna be all right. We're gonna make a plan, we're gonna make a plan. It's okay, it's okay. Go, go, go! Go, go, go! - Oh my God. - Right, this place is gonna cave any second. - Okay. We gotta go. - Yeah, yeah. - We gotta go. - Go. - Come on. Come on, this way. - Wait. - What? - I've noticed usually before the ground strikes, which comes in flurries, there's some kind of like build up lightning, all right, in the clouds. And it seems to build up before it hits the ground. - Right, and you think we've got a warning? - So that's like the last surge has passed or something. - Well, literally it's clear over there. There's nothing in in the clouds, let's go. - Oh, so we should go that way then. - Yeah, yeah, we're gonna get your parents first. And then once we got them, we get the fuck out of this danger zone, yeah? - Okay, yeah. - Yeah. - All right, let's go. - He's dead! He's dead, we've gotta get inside! - Sally! - Sally, come here! - Get in the car! - Sally, get in the car now! - Sally, get in the car! - Sally! - Sally, come over here! Come over here! - Sally, no! - Sally! - We've gotta go, we've gotta go! - Sally. - Any luck yet? - No, I can't get any signal. I'll try, no, I'll call the police after. It's just not working. Oh my God, Sally! How can this be happening, Meg? - Paulie, was he... Paulie, was he definitely dead? - Can you call his parents? Can you call his parents? After you call the police, can you call his parents? They need to know! - Okay. - No, they need to know! - Okay. I can drive if you want me to. - No, no, I'm clear, I'm good. I'm good. You know we're driving right into the eye of this storm. - Yeah, I know, but we just need to go and get my parents and just pick them up and then we can get out of here, okay? Just focus on that. - The storm's gotta be at like 10 miles at least. I reckon we just, we just get them both, and we just get out the danger zone, okay? Yeah? - I heard reports last week, and they said the lightning was knocking out electronics. Depending on the proximity, it's working like an EMP. This is bullshit, man. - Please help me. Can you please get me out of here? Okay. - By Providence Divine, how on earth did you wind up in here? - Please, don't. - I should be pinched to death. - Put away the knife. - I have to be careful. I've already been attacked by one intruder tonight. - He's lying, you're lying! - The lightning, we have to get out of here. - Do you not want to be struck by lightning? - My husband died in this tonight. - You really don't need to worry about lightning anymore. - What, why? - I mean, you were trespassing. It was self-defense. - Run, get out of here, get out of here! - How didst thou escape? I do smell of horse kiss. Oh, woe the day. Oh. - It's so weird. Like no one being on the road. - How did this happen? I mean, what's causing it? - Mother Nature fighting back. - Yeah, Dad mentioned this story yesterday in the paper. - What's the story? - It was a theory about one of the storms, that the lightning tunes to the current of the human body or something. - That sounds impossible. - Yeah, people have been struck by lightning a lot more recently, haven't they? - I mean, it's the second storm in days. What if this is our time? - It just felt a lot worse than what we've been experiencing until now. - I hope not. - Sorry about Paulie. - I should have got him out of there. Should have got him out of there. I should not, I should have got him out of there. Sean. It was a freak of nature, all right? - No, I should, I should have got him out of there! I should have got him out of there! - Paulie's dead! I don't think it's safe to drive anymore. We should... We should head out on foot on the backfields. - Okay. Damn! - Alas. The storm has come again. These are not natural events. They strengthen from strange to stranger. All lost to prayers. To prayers all lost. And so the elements we free! Let them all be hunted soundly. - No. It's the birds I think. No. - What is it? - Meg, just don't look, okay? - What is it, who is it? - Just stay over there, okay? - What is it? - No! He's dead! - No. Mom. Mom? Mom! Mom, Mom! - Oh no, Dad. - Mom! Mom! Mom! No. - Meg, Meg. - I need to find my mom. - Meg! - I need to find my mom. She said... She said she was in a house and they left her. She mustn't go out there, she mustn't go out there. Something must have happened to her! - I know, I know. You said it sounded weird. But we just need to find the house and she might be in there. Yeah, okay. Meg! - Meg? Sean! Where are you? - You know you are not going to get away with this. - Oh, the heavens. That's what all the girls say. - Meg, Meg? Meg, oh my God, Meg. Are you okay? - Sean? Where's Sean? Where's Sean? Sean? - He didn't make it. - Sean? Sean! Sean. Sean! Sean! Sean, Sean, Sean, Sean, Sean, Sean, Sean. Sean, no! No. No, I can't see him! - I'm sorry. I can't do this anymore. I can't do this anymore! I can't, please! - It's okay, come here. - I can't do this anymore, I can't! No, I can't. - It's okay. - I can't, I can't, I can't. - Meg. Meg. - What? - We need, we need to go find the house. We need to go find Mom, okay? We're gonna go, we're gonna get Mom. - Okay. - And I need you, I need you to be strong, okay? I need you with me, okay? - Okay. - Yeah? Okay, let's go. Yeah? - Okay. - That's it, that's it. Okay, look. That could be the house that Mom was talking about. Yeah? That could be where Mom is. - Yeah. - Yeah, come on. Come on. - Yeah. Okay. - No. - Hello? We need help. - No, no one's in. No one's in. - We need to find the door. - They could be gone. - She who dies pays all debts. We can't! - Look, we need shelter. And you need to be more warm. - Okay. - All right? - Why don't you try again? Try the door. - Okay, okay. Wait, there's a car. - All right, well if someone comes back while we're in there then we'll just explain. - Okay. - All right? - Just go, just go. - Come on. - Hello? Hello? - We're looking for shelter from the storm. No power. - Let's go. What are you doing? Finding something to do you up with. Okay, here we go. Sorry. That's a bit better. - Okay. - Hey, it's magic healing. - Yeah, when I was younger, the wounds always seemed to heal like faster, you know, when Dad kissed them. And then when I got older and he stopped, like they just seemed to hurt a bit more, do you know? - Yeah. Hey. I don't know how we do this. - The storm? - No, I mean, after the storm. I don't think I can. - You can. - I mean like when the dust settles and... I just think it's gonna be even harder. The reality of what's happened and... How do we do this? - Together. Come here. - Love you. Shit. - Something's off. - I don't know. What the fuck? Hello? Is anyone there? - What do you think's happening? That he's like hurt or is it like someone dangerous or something, I don't know. What should we do? - I bet it's locked. Should we go in? - I think we should go in. - Yeah. - Jesus, Corin. - What? - What? - I need to open it. Yeah? - Yeah, okay. Go, go, go, go. Go, just go. - All right, come on. - Yeah, go. - Okay. Okay, go. - Mom? - Girls! Just fucking help me! - Oh my God, Mom! - Girls. - Mom, Mom. - Get me out of here. - Okay. - We need to get out of here really quickly. The guy who owns this place is fucking crazy. He kidnapped me. If he finds you here, he'll kill us all. - How long's he been gone? - Oh, I've got no idea. I heard him head out. I don't know where he is. - All right, well. - Quick! - It's okay. People have been dying left and right. If he's out there, he might have been struck. - Oh, I hope so. I want that bastard to die! - Yeah, we need to go. Please, just go. - I saw a knife. I'm gonna go and grab it, okay? I'll be back. - What happened? - There was another woman here before me. Then he said he was gonna replace her with me. He grabbed me from behind. He put something over my face, he knocked me out. And then I woke up tied up in this room! - Mom. - Thank God you came! Oh God. - It's okay, Mom. It's okay. - After you, I know. He showed me some vile and horrible pictures. - Of what? - Other girls, here before me. I recognized a couple from posters around town. After your father... I... - We found his body. - I should have told you. I'm so sorry, Meg. - It's okay. - I just wanted to keep you safe. What happened with your father was just all so sudden. - He's here, quick, come on. - Please, come on quick, help me. - Let's go. - Come on, Mom, Mom, Mom. Just come with me. - Shit. - What? - I forgot my phone downstairs. - Mom, what are you doing? - I'll deal with him. - No! - He doesn't know who you are. You need to get out now, both of you. - No, I think we should all go together. - We have to get through him first, okay, yeah? - Oh! - Oh no, what do we? What do we do? Let's hide, let's hide. Okay. Run! - Wait! We can't just leave her, we can't just leave her. - Oh fuck! - Okay, wait, just stop, stop. We need to come right back. We need to find some way to protect ourselves, okay? - Meg, Meg. - What? - Look. The storm, it's coming back this way. Oh shit. - What do we do? Hostile spirit. It won't be so quick and painless for you. I shall flay each of you in turn. - Oh fuck. - Go! Quick, down here. - If I knew I'd have guests, I'd have cleaned. The spirit torments me, ugh! Hell is empty and all the devils are here. The hour has come. You know what I'm going to enjoy? Making you choose who dies first and who gets to watch the suffering. The god of thunder calls to me once again. Perhaps he wants a sacrifice. It's not enough. I'm going to need more blood! - Go, go! Stay back. - No. Ow. - Hag's here, hence! You're feisty, I like that! Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts. - Mom? Mom, Mom! Are you okay? - Did you get him? - No, come. Get up for a sec. That will do. - Peek-a-boo, cherub! Do you like that, cherub, hm? Aye? You got me good there, didn't you? Ah, move and I'll slice you. You know, my first girl was a redhead. Can't have been more than a teenage girl. She squealed, she did. She begged me to let her go. I told her she would just be mine for the weekend, and then we'd have to go back to her daddy. I fileted her from ear to eat before the end of Sunday. - Meg. Meg? Meg. Oh, a Turk. Can you feel this energy? - You're crazy, you know that? - Crazy people have no clue what they're doing. I'm perfectly sane. I just do whatever makes me feel alive. - You're a fucking psycho. - Good wombs have formed bad sons. - What, what? - Be brave, child. We'll see how brave you are when you meet your maker. I grant it. Or he will. - No. - You've bored me enough, girl. No! - Time to die! - Come on! Mom, come on! That's it. Come on, we need to get out. Come on, we need to go. We need to go now, come on. That's it, come on. Oh my god! All right, we need to get out, it's coming down. Go! - It's over. - We made it. - Let's go, let's go. - Come on. - Come on. - Go on. Hi. - Hey, there. - You okay? - Yes. He would be so proud of you. Your courage that night and what you did to save me. I have so much to thank you for. Meg? - Go on, go to your sister. - Okay, I love you. - Love you. - What are you doing? - All right, so I've decided I'm gonna paint the ceiling in Dad's study because it needs it. But I'm not sure whether to use emulsion or gloss. - I don't know. - Well the WiFi's gone so I can't look it up. - Oh, that's weird, I thought the signal was back. - Yeah, it were, but it's gone again. Might be some like faulty wiring or something. - Or have you even like read the cons properly? 'Cause you know what you're like. - Yeah, obviously, you dick. - You know, maybe emulsion or something. - Yeah. - Yeah 'cause I mean gloss is shiny. So do you want shiny walls? - Shiny! - Shiny. - I'll pick up my brush and I'll come help you, huh? - Okay, cool. Right, I'll go with this one then. Research into the lightning storm, which struck a few months ago is still ongoing. Dr. Becker addressed a summit yesterday with his theory of electrical charge frequency within these unique storms. "In the far north of Iceland, in largely uninhabited areas, "these storms have been more frequent. "What my research has suggested is that a particular charge "of lightning is drawn to the small electrical charge "found within mammals. "Like most storms, the striking points are random, "but during flurries of lightning, "the energy within the storm begins to hone in "to particular striking points. "These can be satellites, electricity pylons, "but as we have found, mammals too. "This would account for the significant loss of life "in the last storm." Dr. Becker had correctly predicted the last storm, the power of which was unprecedented, and which the weather service has denied. With a lightning storm due to come across the East of England this afternoon and evening, Dr. Becker has made the same warning. We'll have more... Office has issued an only Amber alert so far. In other news, the Prime Minister has come under... Again... His alleged ties to Russian Mafia. - It's back.
