Let's propose a toast to Vivian and Hua Hua. Congratulate you guys for giving birth to a healthy and chubby baby. - Congratulations. - Congratulations. You know they say there are three happy things in life. Getting married is the first thing. Having a child is the second. The third thing is carrying a grandchild! You're ranked the first for having grandchildren the most. Yes! Congratulations. Let's take a picture. Hurry! A photograph of the whole family! Especially for the little grandson. Come and see! Look how cute he is! Danny, when you're a month old, we all celebrated at your house. Your mom was over the moon. Wow! Look you're a grown-up now. When are you gonna invite us to the wedding? Hmm... Actually I've already had a boy... He's got a lot of girlfriends. But he's been too picky. Danny. You should get married. You can't only think about yourself. You should think about your mother, getting married. Having a child for your mother to carry for you. Ok. Ok. Don't talk about him. Come! Let's propose a toast to Vivian and Hua Hua again. You are smart, intellectual, and... Inherited best genes from your father and grandparents. Both of you are top-notch! Mom!! Moreover, no one from her family goes to colleges. She only wasted her time playing around. Have you ever thought that there is a chance your son is gonna inherit the genes from her? That's horrible! That's my grandson! Mom! I know everything you're saying! Ok? But you have to respect my choice! It's me who wants to marry her! What? You still wanna marry her? Danny, he... Hi! Bye! The son of my employer. Good morning. - Hi. - Hi. - It's good to be home. - Close your eyes. Closed. Close them. Open. - Happy anniversary. - Oh my God. Castle in Little Tuscany. Our first trip together. It's realloy lovely. I'm so sorry I... I totaly lost the track of time. This trip was so crazy and I just... You're always here. I thought... Why don't you just paint here? Make this your work space? - Thank you sweety. - Happy Anniversary. Happy Anniversary. Do you remember Uncle Wang? His son is back. He even came home with his girlfriend. I told him.. "Girls don't have to be too pretty." The most important thing is she has to be thoughtful, and mature enough to be a wife and take care of the children. "Harmony in a family brings success to everything." Don't you think? I even told him that girls should look average. The fatter the better, with big buttocks. The fertility rate will be higher, right? Mrs. Lee, if you want someone fat with bigger buttocks, your son, at least, should like that type in the first place. Having a girlfriend is not fostering a pig! I need to go now. Mom! How could you do that? Don't you know how old you are? You're 30! Stop wasting your time. How could you say that? Didn't you see her attitude? Not properly brought up! Her family background can't match ours. You should think about your future. We didn't say we're gonna have kids! There are so many people that don't want to have kids. If you don't wanna have kids, why are you having a girlfriend. Youngsters these days are pretty strange. You're healthy with no disease. Why do you not want to have kids? Danny can't have kids. No... He doesn't wanna have kids... Both of you all do this to me... You're the only hope from our family. Otherwise, no one can't carry on our family name. Alright! Mom, I have my own choice! Ok! Could you just stop interfering? Danny doesn't wanna tell you he wants to have a child 'cuz you always act like this. How long is she staying for? Why are you putting my stuff away? - I'm making room for her. Danny, your mom is not going through your bathroom. Trust me, you don't know her. Danny, your mom knows you're gay you don't have to hide this. I'm not hiding, sweetie. It's complicated. - We should take her out to dinner. - No, no, no, no, no. Please. Just one week, please! Besides you really need to water your plants. When was the last time you slept on your apartment? I know but... I really wanted to meet you mom and I can practice my Chinese with her. "You're Mrs Lee." "I've long heard of your name." Not true... It's nice to meet you, Mrs. Lee. Why do you come here alone? Where's your honey? What are you talking about? Really nice! This picture is so weird. The edge of the desk is so sharp. What if the kid gets hurt because of this? My goodness! This is so dangerous for a pregnant woman. This is fine! Remember to change that one. What's in the box? Do you wanna take a shower before having food? It will make you feel more comfortable. Ok. When will you arrange me a meet-up with her? How you guys met? She must be beautiful.

I will sell some of my stocks and retirement pension. I even joked about it with Gary. If I pay with credit cards, the mileage I've collected can offer me 5 free airplane tickets to Taiwan. First class! Or this one. Mom. I know It's not an ordinary way to do. But I really have no choice. I can't marry a woman for the purpose of having a child. Yes. You're right. Don't you think you're forcing me, leaving me no choice? You should at least choose someone healthy, with good education and family. Then, my grandchild will be healthy and smart. Hi.

Danny and I love love this piece. It represents the balance between the extrem and the grace... Mom, what happened? Are you alright? - Thank you. - We need to talk. It was very nice to meet you. What happened? I went shopping. Shopping? East L.A.? Mom, Trader Joe's (A Supermarket) is just around the corner. Why did you go there? I've spoken with Allan and Mike. And they're so happy with their baby daughter. It was my pleasure. They were so caring and respectful, and I was just so happy to see them with their baby girl. I can just tell they gonna be amazing daddies. It was great to see you again Mrs Lee. - You like Chinese herbs? - Chinese herbs? When I pregnant, I eat Chinese herbs. Very important for baby. It's really interesting. I've never had Chinese herbs before but, that's good to know. My mother is a strong believer in the Chinese medicine. It's supposed to be really, really great for fertility. In Taiwan, we have a special mushroom, in very hight mountain very powerful. I want to make my grandson very strong. Wow... You must eat every week. Ok, thank you. Your teeth clean? They're spotless. Perfectly spotless. What does "spotless" mean? It means "extremely clean". And her kitchen is really clean. My family we love to gather in the kitchen. It's like our favorite room in the house. Mom, where are you going? I don't wanna listen to any nonsense from her. If you wanna, just stay here as long as you want. Mom, could you please sit down? What's going on? Very, very bad. Sorry... No, no, no, no, no. We're sorry. Spotless? She's a liar. Mom, what are you talking about? Don't be so rude. I'm rude? You have no idea what kind of awful place she lives in. It's a complete mess! Oh my god. Mom, it's ridiculous! Yes. She is the person you've been looking for. What you mean, mom? I'm doing this for your own good! You really wanna have a baby with this kind of person? You should've at least told me! You think it's that easy? I've always got a headache when I discuss with you! Total nonsense! I'm really sorry. Mom! You purposely ruin my plan! How could you say that? Having a child is extremely important. You can't change the result after you do it. That is, we need to be very scrupulous. Could you just stop! Could you just let me handle this myself? You think I wanna do this? It's all because you're not paying too much attention to this matter. Mom, I'm not a child. I can certainly handle this thing really well. Then, why were you afraid to let me know? It's definitely not a good thing when you hide something from your parent. You will let me know if it's a good thing. I'm not afraid, mom! You never care about my life! You've always bugged Gary about his girlfriend, but you never ask me anything about my boyfriend. Do you know how many boyfriends have I dated? Mom, I'm not afraid to let you know. It's you who never care about my personal life. What kind of attitude are you pulling here? Mom, when is your flight tomorrow? I can cancel an appointment and drive you to the airport. Hello, Mr. Zhang. I'm gonna go back to Taiwan tomorrow. Could you please pick me up? My son is not available tomorrow. I want to get there earlier. What about 2 pm? Thanks. See you tomorrow. Thank you. Mom, have a nice fly. So when were you planning to tell her about us? And why have you kept this a secret from me the whole time? Look, I just think it's really weird that we've been together for two years, and your mother knew nothing about me. I'm sorry. It's not just you. She knows nothing about me. I think she couldn't care less about my personal life. Danny that's not true. She came all the way here from Taipei. Yes because she wants a grandson. - What...? - What? - Nothing. - Sweetie? Why do you wanna a baby so much? Danny, do you know what we have to give up to have a baby? No more fabulous Cruises. No more running in the Canyon or Hula classes on Sunday? You can forget about our annual trips to Mammoth. No more spontaneous wine tasting in Sovereign. - Why turn ourselves down like that? - Sweetie... We can do it all and have it all. No. We can't Danny! You don't know what it means to be a father. Do you know what it feels like to be ten years old alone because... your parents are never at home? What it feels like to have your neighboors, Mr and Mrs Lin at your game, cheering for you because your parents were too busy with their stupid gallery opening? I don't wanna be like my father. Sweetie... You will be a great dad. You don't get it. I don't want to be a dad. I don't know how to be a dad. And it has nothing to do with your child. Sweetie... Why do you wanna a baby so much? It's like... You see her smile... She's so happy... And proud. And you wish she never loses that smile. Oh my god, your mom is a mess. Spying the surrogate? How does she get the address? They don't give that kind of confidential information. It's supposed to be anonymous. She made an appointment to meet with her, Then followed her home. Oh my god... Brilliant, she's a genious. Don't look down on the mothers from Taiwan! They are really something! How about this one? Hi I love being a surrogate mother. It fills my heart with so much joy and love. I'm looking to help you start your own family. And when we found out we were going to have twins, would you imagine it? We were overjoyed. But then they both came down with Fragile X. Fragile X? Fragile X is a genetic syndrome that, Leads to autism, mental or behavioural retardation. We had no idea that both of our twins would end up with Fragile X. So now, six years later, You're suing the Fertility clinic? Yes. Yes. I'm calling to confirm my meeting with surrogate mother number 568. Wednesday? 2:30 p. m. Perfect. Thank you very much. Here it is. 1326. She is really, really nice. And sweet. I like her a lot. What did you say? What the fuck! You can go fuck yourself! You hear me, douchbag? Yeah, drive away to Los Angeles. Your piece of shit! Piece of shit! What are you looking at? Sorry! Your call will be diverted into a voicemail box, Please check it and leave your message. Mom, happy birthday. Mom, I'm sorry. You're right. FOR MY VALENTINE I was always a mildly annoyance to my folks. Always in their way and... that was the worst feeling in the world. To be in someone's way. I know this is important to you, and I don't wish to be in your way. Having a baby is important to me. But so are you. And you were right. I can't possibly have it all. Tate, I've been so incredibly selfish. It's not fair to you... and it's not fair to our child. You just go right here. Good thing about these magazines? They never go out of style. Here it goes. Fill it up. Enjoy it. PLEASE... WASH YOUR HANDS That was quick. I need to get my laptop. You have wi-fi here, right? Oh, shit! ...It's recovering much slower than expected. Economy still have all kinds of concerns. From considerable confidence to what will happen to them on one case. This was not a good day on Wall Street. Hello? Danny? Are you still there? Yeah... Anyways, I'll keep you updated regarding everything. Actually, Danny there isn't a reason for that. The meet is schedule in video conferencing on Tuesday. Ok, what then send me a reminder on Tuesday. You didn't hear this from me. There'll be some changes. They're shutting down the California cell stem. - What?! - I'm sorry, Danny. They getting rid of us? I've just secured that big Century City account for the company. Bobby just told me this morning and it's not my decision. I actually tried telling Bobby that we did needed you. Thanks, I really appreciat it. It's just... It's really, really bad timing. - I... - I know. We get load of business directly from the firms. They outsource everything through Indiana. Telecommunications, graphic design, babies. Babies? Yeah, even babies. Well, have a great trip. Mom, it's not what you think. Ok? What are you talking about? I wanna find an ovule donor in California. My sperms fertilize her ovum. Then, embryo is all we need. Whose ovum? I'm still looking for the donor. We put the embryo inside the Indian surrogate mother. It's like renting an apartment for 9 months. The service here is really good and the costs are low. - Low? - Yes. It's 10 times cheaper than we spend in America. Then, the quality must be bad. - You get what you pay for. - Mom. How could you only care about the costs for this important thing? You have a job. You're not poor. I have no idea why you wanna come here. - What if anything bad happens to us? - Just relax, mom! We haven't got the chance to see the equipment. Why are you always being so pessimistic? This is Preya. She's carrying a baby for Italy. This is Mohini, she's carrying a baby from Ingland. And that's Anita. She has a baby from Zimbabwe. Thank you. All of our surrogate mothers are very humble. Very sincere. Religious and compassionate. We are commited to what we do. We take very good care of them, to ensure that our clients will be happy with our babies. Mom. I'm sorry I don't... Why don't you just find a surrogate mother in L.A.? Then, I can go to L.A. more often to take care of her. And you can also take care of her or even manage her lifestyle. Mom, this is not Americans' way to do things. Ok? We can't control any surrogate mother. We can't get any information of her personal life. If she's pregnant with my child and still has fun at some bars at night, we can't do anything about it. At least she has to stay at the hospital here. And the doctors can take care of them. Doesn't that sound good? But it can be very unpredictable when someone is pregnant. Mom, they are professional workers. They can do it perfectly. Ok? You just want to rule me out! If you weren't a homosexual, things wouldn't be that complicated. You would have a normal family.... And maybe I would have a grandchild now. What is "normal family"? One man and one woman get married and have children. I'm gay, ok? This is what "normal" means to me! Okay? Nothing can change this fact! You're a homosexual. I know that. I know you're a homosexual! What kind of family will you have? How will your friends think about you? When your child grows up, how will his or her friends think about him or her? You only think about yourself. How selfish you are! Other people's thoughts are not important, mom. The most important thing is I love my child. I'll give her the best family. Treating him or her patiently and showing him/her how to encounter the world in front of her. This is what matters, mom! Don't pick up the phone. Yeah, it's surprisingly low. How is that possible? I'm not overweight. I eat healthfully and exercising regularly. Psychological problems or relationship, can contribute to infertility. Emotional stress can Interfere with hormonal degeneration, ynd reduce sperm count as well. You carry to much heavy stuff. Don't carry that much in the future. Your hands and arms are in need of rest. Just leave all the chores to Micky. That's why you hired her. You're right. You found? Thank you, Mrs.Lee. Micky. Just send this present to your twins. And take a half day off. Just relax. Thank you, Mrs. Lee. Cherries? Aren't they expensive? Not expensive at all and she likes it. You bought those for her? You're too kind to her. She even got a half day off on Saturday afternoon. You should have an eye on her or she could run away. She is a foreign worker not a criminal. No... She will be spoiled, become lazy, and give you the attitude. Yep. Yep. You're right. - Hi, Tate! - Hi, Sweetie! - Hey, how did your science project go? - He loved, thank you. Where is Danny? He couldn't make it today. Hey, it's good to see you. Happy mother's day. These are for you. So where is grandpa? Tate. It's good to see you. It's just too painful to see each other right now, So we decided not to for a while. It sounds like you can use a beer. Thank you. You know, Sarah broke up with me once. - No! - Yes. And as soon as she did, she realized she was still in love with me. - Lime? - Thank you. Yes, Sarah, we were talking about you. Happy Mother's Day. Come on, let me show you something. You're so good with Julie. She really looks up to you, you know that, right? Ta-daa! What is this? She painted this for your birthday. Not quite finished yet but we get the preview. The most terrifying moment of your life. And you took the first step into the unknown. For what? This miracle. Julie, we'll try to make a toast. Happy Mother's Day. - Cheers! - Cheers! NATIONAL ADOPTION ORGANIZATION LGBT ADOPTION - COMO ADOTAR HOW TO ADOPT WHERE TO START What happened? I'm fine. Thank you. Your daughters got the present? Thank you, mom. I'm sorry... For keeping you in Taiwan. You must miss them so much. Yes. They want to be doctors when they grow up. Really? They will grow up really quickly. When they grow up, you're gonna have different expectations on them. Mom, you wanna call Danny? He called you today and said he missed you. I think you also miss him, right? He even showed me the photo of the girl he wants to adopt. She is so cute. What? Adopt a girl? This is not even a problem. Just trust me. She's dumbfounded when you told her the adoption thing? You're right! She craves for a grandchild. It's funny. Micky, thank you. You're welcome. Micky, can I ask you a personal question? Of course, just ask. Why did you decide to raise the children yourself? My ex-boyfriend dumped me when I was pregnant. He wanted me to have abortion but I refused to him. As soon as he knew I was pregnant with twins, he left. It's really difficult to raise children on your own. Moreover, you're working in Taipei. It's a long distance from your children. Who's taking care of them? My mom in Bali Island. Giving birth to my babies was the best thing I've ever done. I wasn't sure at first. But one day I felt a little leg kicking my abdomen. That day is the happiest day in my life. She is 25. She got twins, 5 years old. It's the best age for a surrogate mother. - And she's gave birth before. - Yes. Then, we don't have to find some stranger, right? She's at home so I can take care of her. Sorry. I don't wanna be a mother anymore. No. Not a mother. We... We just wanna ask you to have a baby. It has nothing to do with your ovule. I can take care of you. After you give birth to the child, you can go home. You can live with your children. And fulfill your dream. They can go to college and become doctors. Micky. You help me and I help you. Mrs. Lee, why does Danny need me? He's handsome and smart. Because he's different.. From other people. Doesn't he want to get married? He doesn't like girls. He is... He is gay. I knew it. I knew you knew it. Micky, I haven't told anyone about it. I don't even let my friends know it. It's a secret between us. Micky. Could you say yes? I'm begging you. You have to say yes! Hello, son? Listen to mom's words. Don't take drugs. Listen to my words. Do not take drugs. Son, you're gonna hurt your body for taking drugs. Listen to me. Stop taking drugs. You're gonna be dead! Baby! Do you know that? Don't take drugs. Baby. Just stop.. She's a college graduate. Her father is a doctor and her mother is an accountant. Nice family. She likes swimming. The most important thing is she has curly hair like me. Excellent. This just make you look like a Tranny that's all. Hey, guys! I'm in. I missed you so much. Watch with the hair. Watch with the hair. What are you wearing? So... Sorry. Mom, where are you? What's the noise? Wait. Let me find a private place first. Quick. Hey! I was here first. Shut up! Mom! What's the matter sweetie? She cut me in the line. What? You little liar. Oh, calm down! Calm down? You should think it's low and show some respect, you liar. Wait a minute. First of all you're welcome to go in front of us. I see you only have a few items. Second of all. Don't call my daughter a liar. - She doesn't lie. - Well, she's lying now. Actually madam, she's right, you who cut in front of us. Oh, my god! Mind your own business you low bitch. I don't appreciate you accusing my daughter of lying, and using such a foul language in front of my child. You know what? I don't have to put up with this. I'm out of here. - She's good, right? - Excellent. I think the mother is really calm. She's also polite and rational. Yes. Very articulate. And she even argued strongly for what is right. You can see she is a great mom, very careful for her daughter. Her daughter is also smart. Really smart. So which one do you like? The one from San Diego. She is taller than you. It's better for the child considering the genetic aspect. Good. Let me arrange the meet-up. Does your doctor have any further information? After increasing the semen volume, I can move to the next step. Do you take the medicine regularly? Is the medicine from doctor Lin enough? Mom. You just sent me a big box of bottles of medicine. You forget about that? Remember not to masturbate that much, or the good quality of sperm will decrease. Keep them for your future child. What good quality sperm? I woke up in the morning. He haven't came home. The phone was ringing ringing, non stop. Mom picked up the phone. She was crying. Sorry, uncontrollably. There was an accident. Your mother is amazing. You know that? Yeah. She was a mother and a father. I like your mom. She reminds me Miss Lin. Really? Yeah. She gave you everything. Familia. I get that. You're really healthy. Thanks. Excuse me, the thing about embryo implantation... We can't have the operation in Taiwan. My license will be revoked. Revoke the license? "SURROGATE MOTHER IS ILLEGAL" "ILLEGAL AGENCIES CAUSE VARIOUS PROBLEMS "DOUBTS ABOUT SURROGACY LEAD TO ZERO CONSENSUS" Are we breaking the law? The government have been cracking down on the cases these days. If only we're careful, nothing is gonna happen. Mrs. Lee, I think I just back out... Micky, listen to me. Don't panic. Nothing is gonna happen. I promise. Nothing is gonna happen. Please trust me. GAY DADS Mom, out of 18 ova, 10 are good. We have 10 healthy ova. Excellent. Congratulations, Mrs Lee!

Yes. It can be quite expensive to visit US. How do you plan to pay for your trip? Thank you very much. We can't do it in Taiwan or even go to America. What should we do now? India. I'm so sorry. Because of the new regulation they passed last week, no single parent, no unmarried couples, no gay couples. Only male and female married couples. My gay clients are having a very difficult time getting their exit visa. Too risky. I have to go. This will keep the embryo perfectly frozen. Doctor Sukuvanich is just one of the best fertility doctors. In Bangkok we have a close working relationship, and rest assured that the process will be perfect. The liquid nitrogen will keep the... Be careful, Will keep the embryo frozen for at leat five days by your courrier service can get it over there in two business days. - I'm sorry, courrier? - You've got to be kidding me? It's highly reliable. We won't have our baby fetched! - What if it gets lost or stolen? - Switched? We need to do this ourselves. Excuse me, is a problem? Sir, I think we were in the wrong line. This can't go to the X-rays. CSA requires all carry on item go throught the X-rays. I understand, sir but we have a medical certificate from our doctor. These are all the documents from our doctor look, sir. This incubator contains nothing hazardous or infectious... What? Hazardous, infectious? I'm so sorry sir, I'm sorry, what he meant was "All carry-on items must go through the X-Rays scanner for security purposes." - Excuse me? - I'm sorry. What he meant was, we called TSA, And the agent told us that at the discretion of the security officer, Our carry-on items could go through without getting X-Rayed. In this case at my discretion, I need you to put your carry-on items on the conveyor - right now and move along. - Look sir, This contains genetic material, ok? It can not go through the machine. The radiation can cause irreversible damage - To the frozen human embryos. - Frozen human what? Our future child. There's liquid in the container? - Liquid nitrogen. - Yes, but we have a medical certificate. Sir! I need you to put your luggage in the conveyor belt and step aside, now! - So... - I'm sorry madam I, We really, really sorry for causing this trouble. We called TSA before we came, ok? And we got all the necessary paperwork from our doctor, And I just want to assure you that this is perfectly legitimate. We're not trying to play any games here, see, we're not trying to be super heroes, Or sneak any explosives, hazardous materials or... We're just trying to have a baby. Look, here are our medical documents, from our doctor whom, he... Take a look at this. Doctor Schwartz. From west Hollywood. - Yes. - Is his. The handsome doctor with the horrible toupee. Doctor Schwartz? Beverly. Nancy kirkland's Wife. Yes, we're doing very well, thank you. You have a Tate Hughes and Danny Lee? Right. Absolutely. Okay. That was all I needed to know. Nice to meet you, Mrs. Lee. This is our baby. I wanna hug this!! - Micky, this is Tate. - Hi. - Hi. - Thank you. Thank you so much. - Micky, thank you. - You're welcome. - Let's go. - Ok. Mom. I've talked to the doctor. We prepared to put two embryos inside Micky. - Two? - Yes. Because the chance of getting pregnant will be much higher. Mom, maybe you will have twins to be your grandchildren. Twins? It's will be good if it's a boy and a girl. Hello, I' m Dr. Sukuvanich are you mister Li? - Yes. - How was your trip? - It was good. - Great. You wanna come with me to the office? Wow! It's important that before you become a surrogate, that you are aware of all the risks. In a diffiicult child birth a surrogate could lose a lot of blood, and may require a blood transfusion. Sometimes we may need to remove the uterus from the mother in order to save her. And sometimes a woman may die. In those unfortunate cases no one is responsible. Also important. The surrogate has no rights to the baby. They belong to the clients. Micky. Do you understand? Welcome aboard China Airlines flight CI834 from Bangkok to Taipei. We will take off immediately, Please be seated, fasten your seat belt. Thanks. Ladys and gentlemen welcome on board of China Airlines... Wait! Wait! Micky, what are you doing? Danny. Micky. Let's worship the god. Buddha, please send your blessings to Micky. May she lives healthily and happily. May my grandson be safely born in the future. May my son be a competent father. And carry on the family name. Let's go back and have some rest. Everything looks great. She's pregnant. Thank you so much. - Thank you. - Thanks, my pleasure. - Thank you. - Please take the care. - Thank you. - Oh, sweet! Really good. He's so thoughtful. Happy birthday! This cake is gorgeous. Mom, make a wish. Yep. Make a wish. Happy birthday! It's ok, I do by myself. - Do you like Taiwan? - Yeah, I like it a lot. Taiwan is a very good place. Good culture, good people. What do you do? - Are you a married? - Yeah? Actually Danny and I are... Tate. Thank you for coming to my birthday. Happy birthday. Danny is really thoughtful. He even came all the way from America to celebrate your mother's birthday. This is what he wants to do. When will you get married? I've already prepared the red envelope. Have a girlfriend or not? He's too busy to have a girlfriend. Oh. Stop being so picky. Getting married is important. Being busy is not an excuse. You should introduce someone else to him. Did I say something wrong? He probably went to the restroom. How about Mr.Wang's daughter? Yes. Make them a blind date. Why don't you eat them all? I'm full. You must eat. Century city was one of my territories and... I got about 10 accounts for the company. Danny, do you wanna hear baby's kicking sound? The baby is so naughty and even keeps kicking me every day. It's one more. Micky, let's have some fruits. Isn't this for Danny? I'm too old to remember. Let's go. Why didn't you call me before you come here? Mrs. Zhang and Doctor Lin, nice to meet you. - Danny, this zongz is for you. - Come in and have seats. The store in front of the temple has raisin flavor. Really? That's my favorite flavor. That's salted & dried radish flavor. I happen to go out. Let's go for dim sum. We just ate. How can we possibly eat again. Let's go for Starbucks. I have VIP vouchers. Micky, thanks. You can't let her act like this. What are you talking about. She has a boyfriend in Taiwan? You can't let her get pregnant in Taiwan. Ei, Micky. Micky! Such a bad temper. You can't hire her. Find another person. You're all wrong! It's not what you think! The reason why Micky got pregnant was because... Could you stop interfering. You wanna go or not? I wanna go now. The traffic is getting worse this time. Hello. Your Danny's friend from L.A.? Tate, right? Yes. Nice to see you again. Bye. - What happened to you today? - Nothing. Goodbye. Alright. Don't be angry. Let's have some Zongzi. Am I a disgrace to you? Why are you so afraid to let other people know the truth? It seems like a shameful secret to you. It's not like everyone in the world has to know it. We don't steal. We don't mug. We are not doing some immoral thing. Why do you think it's a shame to you? I don't think it's a shameful thing. Micky's been sacrificing so many things for us. How could you let her suffer like this? How could you say that? What about after our child is born? Are you gonna conceal your grandchild forever? Or conceal the fact I'm his gay father? Mom, I'm gonna become a father, ok? I don't want anyone to point fingers and to say bad things behind my back. I don't want my child to grow up in a world full of lies. And what about Tate? How could you say those words to your mother? You hurt me so bad! You're the same! Do you know that? If you can't regard my child as your grandchild, and accept me and Tate in public, we shouldn't have any relations. How could you say that? She has lost a lot of blood. She needs to be given transfusion. The cord is around the baby's neck. She has to have a Caesarean. Our baby. You have't given her a chance. Look, she may failed you, okay? She may reject you, she may reject me, but you have to give her a chance to do it. That's not fair. That's not fair. The way you treated her there? That's not fair. She is trying. You can see she's struggling and you're not even bothering. I mean, tell me one good reason you expect her to treat me like the father of our child, when she had no idea! I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said those words to you. At the beginning, I plan to do it on my own. I didn't tell you because I think you will never want to see me. After we cooperated with each other for this kid, You followed me around the world. I felt that you really supported my decision for having a child. You really wanted a grandchild. I was happy when you're happy. This is the first time I feel that you really care about me. Mom. I'm in need of this feeling. I want you to be proud of me. This is the reason why I have hid a secret from you. I'm afraid to tell you that secret. The Asian donor that you like. Tate was working with her. We had to make sure our sperms are in good condition in order to have a healthy baby, so, we made two embryos and cooperated with two donors. Finally, we put two embryos with different sperms... One is Tate's and the other one is mine. Inside Micky. I didn't tell you because I know you really want your grandchild with our blood. I'm afraid to hurt you and let you down. I know it's not what you want. There's a chance the baby's not mine. But this is my life. I have to make a choice on my own, be honest to myself, and to you as well. Sweet? Mom. I love Tate. I love our daughter. We don't really care who the real father is, because we're family. Tell me. Tell me. What should I do? Congratulations. Thanks. Congratulations. Congratulations. Danny and Micky! Congratulations. So cute. So pretty. Finally you've got a grandchild. Nice! You see. Oh, my God! Is that her? Congratulation, I'm so happy for you. - It's good to see you. - I'm happy for you both. Yes, after Taipei, I'm going to visit Hong Kong and then I'm gonna go to Tokio. - Uah! - Yeah. Welcome! My good friends. Thank you for coming, to the feast celebrating the first month of my granddaughter. You know they say there are three happy things in life. I have to thank three people today. Micky. You are our benefactor. Our Lee family will always thank you. Forever. Danny. My son. He's brave. He doesn't care what people think. He strive to do things he thinks is right. You love your mother. But you're afraid to hurt your mother. You love Tate. You love him so much. I understand. Because I was in love before. Mom is proud of you. You bravely walk out your first step. And welcome your future. Tate, thank you. Thank you for taking care of Danny and my granddaughter. I've been worried if Danny was capable of being a father. Now he has you. I'm relieved. My baby, Victoria is really lucky to have parents like you guys. You understand my chinese? I understand.. Perfect. Let's eat now. Let's eat. Danny, when will you and Tate get married? Yeah. We've been waiting for so long. When you get married, we definitely will fly to America. Ok! Your daughter is so cute. Thanks. Cheers! Congratulations. I should go now. Mom. Thank you.
