Radical Women: Latin American Art, 1960-1985 “When a subject is highly controversial one cannot hope to tell the truth. One can only give one’s audience the chance of drawing their own conclusions as they observe the limitations, the prejudices, the idiosyncrasies of the speaker. Fiction here is likely to contain more truth than fact ”. Virginia Woolf. Fiction more truth than fact. - It’s exactly what we’re living. - Totally. Totally. Fake News. When I went to the exhibition, I was thinking about the Latin American artist's body. Well, there was this letter thing too. Have I already showed you? Universidad Autónoma de Bogotá found connections between them with letters they exchanged, which is amazing. Each one of them at one spot in Latin America. - Did the artists write to each other? - Yes! They have this thing in common that they are saying the same thing at the same time, living very similar realities in the context of lack of freedom. Is that why you are going to travel? I will do it, I don't know exactly what because I think these women are being forgotten, they're forgotten. And I think it's time to talk about them. “Because of Chiki Weisz, I met Ana, a very intelligent and talkative Brazilian”. This woman appears in some letters, - ...a common point. - Ana who? They don't say it. - They talk about her, but you don’t know who she is. She appears over and over. - The letter I read, also talks about Ana. There are many of them. Other letters talk about other works of hers. Where are they? - It doesn't end. - Yeah. It makes me want to unfold it. - It's endless. -It is! Unfortunately, endless. The endless list. It is from 1978. In the context of the military dictatorship. It’s impressive that she did it during dictatorship. - Brave... In Brazil, there are over 430 people who were killed or vanished during the dictatorship. Many of them are women. But unlike Chile, the responsible ones have never been through trial. I remember the mother of a missing woman I met at my parents’ house when I left prison. She was a humble and shy lady who would do anything to find her daughter and she was there looking for information. The military said her daughter had gone to Poland, others said she went to Colombia. The mother had no money, so borrowed money, sold what she had. But she would go wherever they said her daughter could be. No use saying they were lies. It was horrible to see that fragile lady go after someone we knew was missing. That is: dead. Murdered. Ana. Untitled Stela wanted to find Ana, the Brazilian who was missing. I decided to turn this work into a movie, because I knew I would find my generation in this search. Welcome to Havana's Airport. For your information, the local time is 01:37 pm. Havana, March 15, 1968. Dear Feliza, I was very interested after hearing about your work. I knew that you’re making sculptures with metal waste, unused iron and car parts. I like artists who can give meaning to different types of materials. Not only marble, wood and plaster, but also the other things we throw away. I'm writing because I believe creativity is a social matter, not an individual one. That's why I decided to teach. After facing so much adversity here in Cuba, we need creative people. Thanks for your help. Regards, Antonia Eiriz. Unamuno said that Portuguese is Spanish without bones. Maybe this is why this mix of Yoruba and white people has more tragic sense than ours. They will not pass. They will not pass. They are passing... - There? - Yes, ahead. Thank you. Don't you have any engraving from Antonia? - I had many engravings from Antonia, but they were all sold and I didn't keep any. We were very close friends. I was her student and then I became her assistant. It's funny that you are Brazilian. - Is it? Why? Because Antonia talked a lot about a Brazilian girl named Ana. Yes, Ana was her name. - Ana? I know Ana. - Have you met Ana? I found her name in several letters. She’s Brazilian and an artist too. Yes, and talented, apparently. Young, impetuous. That's what Antonia used to say. - And do you know how they met? Antonia taught at an workshop in Argentina. And when she got back, she was amazed by this girl. - She also told me that Ana was a brave woman. But Ana who? Do you know her last name? - No, I never heard of it. - Do you want to continue? - Yes. Open it. Look... This was a job Antonia was doing with young artists. It's from a performance in Buenos Aires. She brought it here and I kept it. I found it so beautiful. It is very beautiful, But you can't see who it is. This is Ana. - Can I take a picture? - Yeah, sure. When I first read the letters, I noticed Ana right away. Her shadow. I asked the girls from “Proyecto Nosotras” about this young woman, often mentioned as an extraordinary woman. They said they had never been able to identify her and then she disappeared. That day, at the exhibition, Ana got a face. But her story was still missing. And today Ana has got a reality. After that, I was wondering why she abandoned art. Couldn't she become the person everyone expected her to be? Where did she spend the last days of her life? In prison? In the clandestinity ? - In a mental hospital? - In a mental hospital. Is she alive somewhere? This is the room from the 60's, one of the most controversial of the National Museum of Fine Arts. Here you can find all the work from Antonia Eiriz, who is one of the few women represented on this floor and the only woman represented in this room. This is a time in the 60's when we wanted a Soviet realism, especially in the paintings. Well, this completely breaks it. This is more as a grotesque expressionism, which had nothing to do with what we were artistically looking for at the time. After 1959, with the Cuban Revolution, even though the Cuban government never imposed a type of art, never dictated the type of art people had to do, it was known that artists and creators who had a controversial, contentious, non-reaffirming work of the revolution as they wished were not encouraged as artists who did support the revolutionary process in a strong, aggressive, dynamic way. So, Antonia was a part of this group of artists who wanted to show the inner self of the human being, the issues of mankind, the existential dramas. This is a work that shows no happiness. Here we see how a virgin becomes a woman, a poor woman even. With the sewing machine, we know she works, she's a seamstress. - And the angel... - The angel is death. His body is talking about abortion, about the situation of women, because this is a time when women no longer have children. Eventually, critical reviewers, the state began to censor her. Artists weren’t sent to prison. This isn’t a time when artists were arrested, but they were forbidden to exhibit their work. And if they couldn't exhibit… If they could, the exhibition could only last a day. And preparing, setting up an exhibition for just one day was insane. And this censorship issue causes a breakdown in her life. And eventually she retreats to Juanero. She starts working on the papier mâché technique. And she stops painting. I think... After she finishes, she completes the papier mâché workshop, Maybe due to nostalgia, or will on seeing her family in the US, she starts visiting Miami, around 1990, 1991. She starts visiting her family. She starts traveling to Miami and back to Havana. And on these trips, to see her family and other friends she had in the US, Cuban painters who lived there… - And could she leave? Yes. She could leave without problem. They pushed her into painting again, they encouraged her. And she started painting in the U.S. in 1993, 1994. In fact, in the year of her death, she had a solo exhibition in Miami. “Because of Chiki Weisz, I met Ana, a very intelligent and talkative Brazilian. She does a perplexing work on the streets with disposed objects”. I love reading letters from dead people. A bit cruel, I know. Reading letters from others is always a kind of cruelty. But reading a letter from a dead person is even more so. Because besides breaking into someone's privacy who didn't write to you, It's as if you’re saying, I'm alive, you're dead. I can still be something, but you who are already dead, might have been someone important, but now you're nothing. You can’t become someone. And the worst... Do you know what's worse? You may become what the living people did from what is left of you. What you left behind. Buenos Aires, December 6, 1968. Dear Lea, In the past months, I’ve been writing with some delay. These were days of hard work. We went to Paksa's event, "Cultura 68", and we were surprised by the diversity of groups from very different backgrounds. Facing the extreme political situation, we thought about the importance of being united, not only for our identifications, but also for our disagreements. Paksa says that culture, just as life, is related to the right to learn and to teach. The right that belongs to all of us. Likewise, ideologies and politics belong to us. We were excited with the number of students and young people at the event. Among them, there was a young woman we met at Maria Luisa's. Her name is Ana, she is 19 years old. She told me she was raised in the southern of Brazil. And what’s up? Many interventions in Paris? Miss you, Alicia. Hello, baby. Are you my baby? What do you want? Do you want a little toy? Do you? What's wrong? Are talking to me? This performance wasn’t done by Ana, but by the Argentinian Lea Lublin in Paris, when she took her son to a museum and took care of him all day long. That gesture changed everything. This performance couldn’t have been done by Ana; she’d have been barred in the museum for being black. Or, expelled because they’d think she was a nanny. In fact, no one would ever think she was the artist. Women here are beyond feminists, like a movement, as American feminism, no... But they had a very strong statement, politically strong. What do you think about Lea's "Mon Fils" performance in Paris? Lea had similar attitudes. When she had the boy, she raised him on her own. Everyone knows who the father is, but he didn't give the boy his last name. She said, "You don't want to get married, you don't want to register him, I don't care, the son is mine”. It was also a gesture of freedom and positioning her own body. So, the grand duke finished his task. He had found the owner of the little glass shoe. He took her to the castle, where Cinderella and the prince got married and were very happy. In 1980, Maria Luisa came to see me, and she had a project. She said something like: "If I don't do it with you, I won't be able to, because I need a woman as a producer”. When I met her, she was 59 years old. She always said she had started too late. And that she had no time to lose. So, we worked hard. I have been to 5 of Maria Luisa's works. All Maria Luisa's films deal with women who somehow break standards. Maria Luisa was openly feminist. The word "feminism" wasn’t well accepted in the 80's in Argentina. It was like... She was... She was in the cinema to say something. She wasn’t there to make just a film. In this sense, for me, she is an unforgettable character. - Have you met Ana? No, I didn’t meet her in person, but I heard about her. I think she doesn't work with cinema anymore. She is doing something with plastic arts, but I don't know her. I didn't get to know her. Well... Ana was a very beautiful girl. Very open-minded. We met while making Maria Luisa Bemberg's film. She was black, she was sassy, she was provocative. She was a not easy person, That is, she was kind of dangerous. Because when there’s too much freedom in a being, some people… We got some of Maria Luisa's cartridges, which were given to us, super 8 cartridges. And then we worked, we did some stuff. These are the things that I kept over time Especially when the Onganía's dictatorship began. Which was an authoritarian, totalitarian, anti-communist, anti-Peronist, conservative, Catholic nationalist regime. A real horror. Of course, if there was a raid… Here it says "raid" when the police take too many people away. A young black woman quickly becomes a victim. My stories haunt me. Will they always be the same as in the past, or they simply repeat today? I remember when Soledad Barret was murdered in Recife in an armed action done by the repression along with Cabo Anselmo, an insider on the left, Soledad's life in Uruguay came to light . Six terrorists die in shooting in Pernambuco In 1967 in Montevideo, she was kidnapped and hurt with a razor. And when she died, Mario Benedetti dedicated her a poem. The cables say you resisted and there will be no way but to believe. Because the truth is that you resisted just standing in front them. Just staring at them, just smiling, just singing "Cielitos" facing the sky. Soledad, compatriot of three or four peoples. The fair future you lived for and for which you never refused to die. They kidnapped Ana. I didn't see it, but they told me, the people who were with Ana when it happened and then Ana herself when she came back from wherever she was. It was a group of young men. They threw Ana in a car and took her. And they scarred her. Was she from any political group, any party? - No. She wasn’t from communism, nor from the Peronist resistance. She wasn’t a woman politically involved with any party. But of course, she was anti-racist and very free. And I suppose there are people who, when they see their ideas, their ideology threatened, they just act like that, hurting people. - Léo? - Yes? - Can I take your time a little bit? - Say it. Can you tell us what your memory from the dictatorship is? Your memory from the 60's. I won’t ask Lucia because, besides being a character of the time, she already talked a lot about it. - Léo's memory from the 60's: I didn't have much to do with this time. My parents weren’t political prisoners, they weren’t persecuted, but even so, there’s no way of not getting involved. Ok, but how do you feel about that? - How I feel? I haven’t lost anyone, my family, my parents are there. But, for example, Lucia, Do you remember that I went with you to the Truth Commission in your statement? I always found it important. And there were meetings at your house with all the MR-8 leaders, a few times... I didn't remember that. But there were. - It had a big impact in my life. - Meetings in my place? - Yes, dinner. All of your friends were from the armed movement. I've known you since I was 17 years old. It's been 20 years. Fine, but no one was militant anymore. We were former political prisoners having dinner and celebrating our friendship. We may have talked a lot about the past. Now, I'll ask Andressa, who was born later. - How did it impact in your life? I just really understood what it was in my teens. And why my grandma said we couldn't go out without a document at all. Even if it was only to buy bread. Maybe it was because of her memory of the dictatorship, that I only understood in my teens when I was aware of a whole oppression towards black people. The dictatorship, for us, never stopped happening. It is here until today. - What about you, Stela? - What about me, Léo? - Left-wing parents without tragedy? I think the dictatorship was a tragedy. I have it in my memory. I was 12 years old and my sister was much older than me. She was an amazing girl, a full grown woman. And everyone expected her a bright future. So did I. I thought she was going to be... When I was 12, she died, suddenly. Until today there are days that I just... I can’t believe I’ll never see her again I wonder what she would be like and I'll never know. My sister decided to die. Did she give up? “I'm not like those people who stay at home listening to the TV to see what's going on. I was born a fighter, I was born with memory. Along with the 'madres', we’ve already changed History. We’ve already changed History. “I'm not like those people who stay at home listening to the TV to see what's going on. 'Madres de la Plaza' the people embrace you. Alert, alert, alert that they are alive, all the ideals of the missing. Alert, alert, alert that they are alive, all the ideals of the missing. - Can you tell us your story? We mothers have no personal history. - Don't you? - No. We tell what happened to us, how we got together and why we fought. We all fought for our children and their ideals. They were revolutionaries that fought for a better world. And the mothers supported this fight. A better world, better people. Something supportive and a freer country. - Hi, baby. - I congratulate you. Thank you very much. - I'm happy to see the 'mothers' here. And who is this beautiful young woman? Stela. - Pardon me? - Stela. So beautiful. Thank you for resisting for so long. - So long. - Yes. - Well done. - Thank you very much. - Time and awareness. In this youth, we have hope. That this youth knows where they are going and what they want. - Yes, this youth is very aware. Let it be for the good of all. We had 30,000 wonderful young people fighting for a worthy country, so that there was bread on everyone's table, education, health. - We hope you fight for it. - Let this come back. Dear Kati, I'm writing to let you know that everything went as we expected. Ana arrived 5 days ago at our house and we are really enjoying her company. We’ve agreed that she’ll stay here until early March. I told her she could stay as long as she wanted. But she's already arranging some things. She said she plans to go to Mexico, where she thinks she’ll have better conditions to develop her work. I’m writing to you to help her as you can. Kisses, Victoria. These letters, which Ana didn't write, are our maps to meet her. They are our maps. True. But why are you so worried about this story? Almost obsessed, I'd say. I don't know. I guess it reminds me of my sister, I get the feeling that in our dead people, there is the lost talent, that thing we’ll never be able to accomplish. I don't know - Let’s go. - Let’s continue? - Yes. - But, Stela, what if she just gave up? I'll film you. - What if she wasn't so tough... What if it wasn't because. of poverty, sexism or the military? What if she was just untalented? - Do you think she was untalented? She was talented. We saw her work. We saw what these women said about her. She was talented for sure. But maybe she couldn’t stand it. Maybe she had to give up. Maybe she opted for an anonymous life. Also, if so, this is what we will tell. The story of giving up. - Okay, but can you make a movie out of it? Lucia, can we make a movie out of it? The bad thing is when you meet someone, when this person is in front of you and you don't ask enough questions. And when this person dies, we are unaware of an extraordinary character, right? And a past is then created of which we aren’t absolutely sure. This house is part of Frida's personality. All these elements are integrated, the color, the plants, the animals, which we see in Frida Khalo's works. All of this cohabitated here. At this time, there’s a whole change of values in Mexico. From the Mexican Revolution, there is like a reunion with Mexico. It’s the post-revolutionary Mexico. And all these artists like Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, Lola Álvarez Bravo, Maria Izquierdo etc. they belonged to a group of post-revolutionary artists. So, they bring the revolution in their blood. With the urge to change, to recover Mexican values. And with this post-revolutionary Mexico, where Diego, Frida and the others are, a lot of things change and so do women. All of this causes changes in the personality and also in the woman's strength and drive. First, women were very invisible. Even Frida Kahlo, at her time, as she was called in Paris at the Pierre Colle Gallery, was Madame Rivera. Even her who is the greatest figure in the world, because she is recognized worldwide, right? Here she became as important as the Virgin of Guadalupe. So even her, including her, was, not stigmatized, but was not taken seriously. Look at this, Virginia Woolf: “Would the fact of her sex in any way interfere with the integrity of a woman novelist - that integrity which I take to be the backbone of the writer? Well, in some authors it is clear that anger was tampering with the integrity. As if they abandoned their stories to attend to some personal grievance. We feel the influence of fear in it; a buried suffering, a rancour which contracts those books, splendid as they are, with a spasm of pain”. - I think fear is part of our lives. In mine, for being tortured and living with these ghosts. In your play, because of violence against women. Can you imagine a black woman traveling around? I was the only one from the staff who was stopped at the airport and was interrogated for 4 hours by 5 men. Can you imagine Ana? Imagine Ana in the 70's. - No, I think it's different, right? - Different? - What do you think, Andressa? I can't imagine what it was like in the 70's. If it was horrible to me, imagine to her. It must have been much worse. - But it was for you too. - It was awful. There are women who seem to survive ghosts, others who capture them in their works. Kati Horna. As an artist of the 20th century, my mother, in my view, has a characteristic that is her great knowledge, which combines a great technique with a special look. We're talking about Kati's journey. Did she study in Berlin? She was from Hungary and went to Berlin to be with Berthold Brecht, she became friends with him and his group, but the book burning started and she ran away, going back to Hungary. She was so scared that she never understood how she got on the train, how she got there. - Did she take a photography course in Hungary? In Budapest. She took a course there. A short six-month course and then she immediately went to Paris. Living in Paris, taking pictures, she did her first work at the Flea Market. Another situation is when she went to work in Spain for the Anarchist Federation. So she went to Spain for the FAE and then she met my father. And in 1939, they arrived in Mexico, in October. Mexico City, December 28, 1969. Dear Ligia, I was very touched by your words. Your fascination with my series "Dolls of Fear" corresponds to my enthusiasm for your work "Divisor". I’m writing to you to express my support for Maria Bonomi and the artists who refused to exhibit at the X Biennial in São Paulo. I had a meeting with artists to discuss the boycott. There, because of Chiki Weisz, I met Ana, a very intelligent and talkative Brazilian. She told me about the political situation in Brazil and the horrors committed by the military regime. 1968 was also a dark year in Mexico with the Tlatelolco massacre, but we’re still the country that receives the most exiles from the many dictatorships that gradually settled in Latin America. Fondly, Kati Horna. Kati started teaching at the university around 1973. At that time, she did a lot of work with the students, and some of it was very interesting. And they were filmed. I archived and cataloged her materials because they seemed to be the portrait of a difficult time. - Is she your Ana? - Yes. From the information I have, she was a student who was always trying to break the rules, overcome the limits, break the boundaries. She wasn’t an easy woman. She didn't finish the course; I think she went to Chile. - Chile? - Yes. - Do you know her last name? - No. She signed as Ana. Just Ana. I think even in her passport. So, Lourdes, were you Kati Horna's student? Yes, I had the privilege of studying photography with her. Kati, with this great experience and this attitude, especially, which is the most important, this attitude between rebellion and experimentation And these are the little things that I kept and that were my attitude towards photography, which she shared with me. And I feel that I recreate this in my wrestling work. I never worked for the media because it restrains you and so you have to show who wins the fight and don’t look for an image. But women were who really touched me. Because with them I understood that the concept of feminism that was conducted in this country was imported from Europe and the USA, but it doesn’t correspond to Mexican women. And these fighters, sassy, strong women, that break everything… Many wore masks so that their families didn’t know they were fighting. They give me a different sense of what a woman is. This loving mother bottle-feeding her baby is a cop. There are, then, many different aspects of imposing women, who aren’t subject to anyone controlling them. Of course, they suffer from “machismo”, this isn’t over, but there they are. The Olympic Games came and everyone sat in front of the TV to watch the athletes coming from all over the world. But one black American athlete said no Olympics was worth the death of a student. He raised his fist and said it. Friends told me at night: “There is blood on the walls, the elevators have bullet holes, there are many broken glasses. Come, please, come!” So I went while feeding my baby and I saw some terrible things. I saw everything they told me and one more place filled with shoes, heels, male shoes, lots of shoes thrown on the floor, from people who had ran away and lost them because they were shooting at them. I think the shooting lasted too much, more than... In general, they say it was terrible. So from this moment on, I began to gather statements from men and women who were there. A family mother, Margarita Nolazco, shouted through the taxi window as she left the square, “They are killing the students in Tlatelolco! They are killing the kids!” Then the taxi driver said to her, “Lady, please close the window glass. Close it or I'll drop you off at the next corner.” There was an apathy, an ignorance. It was in this square where the massacre happened. More than 300 people were murdered. It isn’t known exactly how many there were. They didn't care if they were children, elderly people. They were just objects that they had to destroy - And they did. - Yes. Latin American stories keep repeating. In Brazil, student protests were also suppressed in the name of sanitizing Rio de Janeiro for the 2016 Olympics. But nothing compares to what happened in Mexico City. The Olympics began just ten days after the Tlatelolco massacre. BLACK YES BLACK I AM - Look at this. I love it. - Very beautiful. Strong, right? - Strong. Her simplicity and everything it says. I'm really glad you kept it. We became friends at the university. Ana arrived in Mexico very shaken by what happened in Argentina, but slowly, she was recovering and went back to work. I think for having survived the massacre, I got close to Ana. We had similar stories. At that time, she went to live with Silvia. I'm sorry, but who is Silvia? A young Chilean acting student. Then we knew nothing else about them. Only that they suffered a lot of prejudice. It wasn’t easy being a gay couple at that time. - I can imagine. - Yeah. - Emma? - Stela? - Yes! - Thank you very much. - No, on the contrary. When I knew you were looking for Ana, I wanted to come. She and Silvia were very kind. My older sister shared an apartment with them. I was a girl, I spent a lot of time with them. They were very affectionate with me. I think I was the daughter they wanted to have. What about your sister? - She died a long time ago. Look, this is my sister. - Did you sing? Here we were singing, years later, a song they taught us. The memories… Is there any in particular? - Yes. Ana took me to university because I said I wanted to know her school. To me, it was amazing to be in this place where important people studied. Silvia met us at the Fine Arts College. And then they took me to "La Opera" Picture it, a 12 year old girl from a traditional family, with a gay couple in a canteen where Pancho Villa had been to. Well, I thought it was a real opera. No, "La Opera" is a canteen downtown. When we got home, my sister was told that they had taken me to Chapultepec Fair to celebrate my birthday. That was our secret. Here I am in a pedagogical meeting at the School of Philosophy and Literature. I think that was their inheritance. And here are them both. - Is this Silvia? - Yes. Silvia and Ana. Then I learned that they went to Chile. And we didn't hear from them anymore. - Not even from Silvia? - No, no. When they killed Allende, many Chilean exiles came to Mexico. But we didn't hear from her anymore. We never heard anything again. It’s amazing why Allende has become a human rights totem. I think no one will be able to erase the image of Allende. It’s impossible, it’s above anything. He is and will be, and will continue to be. Regrettably for the unwilling. He’ll be here. From here they took him dead, some say he committed suicide, others that he was killed. There is a whole tale about that. For us, they killed him. Luz, my master: How are things in Santiago? Too hard? I write to tell you about a work, or rather an action that a group of students took in Mexico City last month that reminded me of you. I think you’d enjoy being here and meeting Ana, who designed the project. We took a course together at the university. She arrived in Mexico a year ago and we met because she wanted to make some collage for a mural. Her idea was to paste reproductions of works by very different artists alongside two questions: What is your art? What about your politics? No doubt this experience will arrive there someday. Ana is thinking of going to Chile. She is very interested in Salvador Allende's government. I think you will get along well. A big hug, Pola Weiss. This bus traveled around Santiago during the 90's. So, in 90, it was possible to see, below, the painting of Luz, which had already been painted above. But with the cold, the rain, it was peeling. - And it appeared again. - It appeared in the 90s. It was the last record of Luz Danoso's painting. I met Luz Donoso as an artist. The history of the murals comes from Allende's early campaigns. And it gains a lot of strength in the 70s. Not only the artists work, but brigades are created. They create, for example, the Ramona Parra Brigade, which was a brigade of the Communist Party, the youth of the party that worked on the murals with the artists. After Ramona Parra, there was a long period when there were no murals, because we were in a dictatorship. That is, it was absolutely forbidden by law to create any urban intervention on the street. CADA created walls with banners, using the slogan "No más" as an artwork. - This is the bridge that... - From CADA video? - Yes. - Yes. That's from Cada. - Where do they throw "No más" from?" - Yes, the "No más". So, people was walking up here, when the guards came, they hid on that bridge. - Do you remember the video? - Yeah, I remember. When came the dictatorship, all of us artists, we were very scared. So each one worked at home in isolation. In around 1975, a group of artists and I decided to get together because we wanted to work on different subjects. And we knew we had to go to the street, it made no sense not to do it. We wanted to do a political and artistic work at the same time. And we started the art actions in Chile. You have to understand that at that time we were very isolated. People outside thought that those in Chile were with Pinochet and that wasn’t the case. Ah South America! Six planes fly over Santiago city, dropping 400,000 art pamphlets into its most populous neighborhoods. “Ah, South America! When you go through these places and look at the sky and under the snowy peaks, you recognize in this place the space of your lives: the color, dark skin, stature and tongue, thought”. That is, we’re talking about our race as well. About the Latin American matter. At this time, in the days of Popular Unity, I worked a lot on the movies. We were finishing filming Miguel Littín's "The Promised Land," a very interesting epic story. And some people on the team who worked on the film knew some people who came from Brazil. Among them, Ilo Krugli, who proposed us a show for children And we did everything: the sea, which was a large painted fabric, the pulleys, the little boats. It was a very social spectacle, because the little boat, from a river, reached the sea and found a very arrogant ocean liner that was related to what was going on in the country. And there was Ana, a very beautiful and very talented black Brazilian girl. In terms of fine arts, drawing, painting, she was very talented, a very beautiful person. In my work, I bring my body. And all that it supports. That's why I came here. I am always looking for spaces where this can exist as a statement, as a speech. The oppression of the dictatorial regime is a constant for the black body, for the body of a black woman, a Brazilian black woman. I don't even know where I am walking through, but I have my guides and I’ll fulfill my destiny. What happened to the group on the coup’s day ? The group disappeared on the same day. We didn't see each other anymore. It was brutal. Ilo Krugli was taken to a regiment. The very wild military… I heard he had been through a horrible situation. He spent some time there, then they expelled him to Brazil. Also, another boy who worked on the show, there were 4 or 5 Brazilians and we were 3 Chileans. One of the Brazilians, the last thing I knew about him, was that they took him out of the house with his wrists tied with wire, they put him into a truck and took him. We didn't know about him anymore. We didn't know more about Ana either. Look... Ana had... ... a kind of melancholy. I believe she has suffered many blows of life and yet she kept a utopian view of the world. And she acted in consequence of that. These are the people who suffer the most, right? The last we knew was that they took her to the National Stadium with her mate. - Silvia? - Yes, Silvia. We knew that Silvia couldn’t stand the torture and died. About Ana, we didn't know anything else. She wasn’t even a number of statistics. She disappeared. When there is the coup in Chile, they notify the UN. And the UN sends a committee of the International Red Cross. And all the photographs we’ll see of the National Stadium as a detention camp belong to the Red Cross visit. This gallery remains as it was at the time, in 1973. It’s empty as a reminder of what happened here. And how many people were detained here? - During the two months that the stadium worked as a detention center, more than 20,000 people. Here were also foreigners of up to 38 nationalities. Among those who were most here: Uruguayans, Brazilians, Argentines and Bolivians. - And did it only have Chilean military or also of other nationalities? - It’s known that here arrived Uruguayans, Brazilians and Argentines. In the case of Uruguay and Brazil, they came with the mission of interrogating the detainees here who were of these nationalities, and they also came with the mission of teaching interrogation and torture methods that were being used in these two dictatorships. It is known that when the stadium became a detention camp, the Brazilian military was already installed. Thus, it is also assumed that at least all the dictatorships of that era were aware of what would happen in Chile and many of them began to travel since before. We also have a statement about women's locker rooms, about a Brazilian woman who was detained here. The military had to give her the news that her partner had died due to the torture process. And when they tell her, she reacts by running out of her locker room. And the women in both locker rooms run with her. because they knew that if she left alone, they would kill her. But if they all came out together, they'd probably put them all back in the locker room. - It seems to concretize a... I'm sorry. - You knew these stories, didn't you? But I had never seen it. Like this, stepping here. I had never seen or imagined. - Is it different for you because they’re women? - Do you feel different? - A lot. Quite different. This thing about the feminine, the pregnant women, what they talk about solidarity. It’s very... It is physically a feeling of… I hadn’t thought. And we came to a place that was… Then I knew it was a clandestine house, a hidden house where people were tortured. We entered this place through a corridor, and there was a very small space where many people were. There was a terrible smell. So they took me somewhere else and there was a cell where there were a lot of people. It had 6 or 7 more women. And that was how, one night, Ana appeared. They opened the door in the middle of the night and pushed her inside. And she talked a lot. We all talked a lot about the same, what was happening to us, but she talked a lot about torture, about what she had recently experienced. She told me that she was with her girlfriend, Silvia, and that they tortured both of them together. First, they seized both at the ankle and wrist. Then they gave them electric shock. They put it on their tongue, their vagina. They beat them. And they made her torture Silvia. Her pain was that she did it. Do you understand? What she could not bear was to have lived through this situation and to give in to what the torturers asked of her. Why do we think those who couldn't do something, because of social pressure from husbands, police, could have had a lot of talent? Why would they be better than us who stayed and are leaving something? Why this certainty that those left behind had a huge thing to do? People tend to mythicize. First, the blame for being alive. It also happens when someone loses their mother or father. And if they die early like Gardel or Evita, we create a myth. Or like Alberto Greco who committed suicide. He was a conceptual artist in Spain, who wrote "end" on his hand and committed suicide. He ended up doing a work of art. I think the human being who makes such a decision… it’s very hard to say. Some will say he was sick and wanted self forgiveness. That is, I believe that… who knows the issues and the existential pains he had? I don't think there is one single answer. We met people who were great, very smart and talented, who had a lot to give and their lives were early ended. This meant not only the pain but the loss of all the things they’d have brought to Argentina. And many companions, militants and guerrillas who are still alive also feel guilty about being alive. If we talk about the missing, well... It's terrible because they couldn't show what they were worth. But either way, I think it’s of great value to anyone who wants to change things. And I've always said that, in fact, I didn't go that way for being a coward. I don't feel like I was smarter. Here they tortured my son. - Do you think she's alive? It has a contour drawing nothing, a weird trace. - She said her father had a place to fix tires. A "vulcanización" as we call it in Chile. Mr. Descartes, I'm searching a person named Ana. Her father had a tire shop here. This lady I don't know, but there's a tire shop a block from here. - Really? - Yes, from Mr. Alemão. Then I'll go there. -Thank you very much. - You're welcome. - He knows nothing. - Nothing? - He told us to look over there. I saw that there is a tire shop near. It is impossible. Looking for an Ana in a tire shop is very generic. It's no use. I don't know what to do. She lived in a small town called Don Pedrito. - Thank you. We became very friends, so over time she was telling me pieces of the story and then I managed to assemble the puzzle. She thought they were coming after her, to take her. Then she calmed down and everything changed. She began to say that they were going to discover her works, that she’d be recognized worldwide for her work. She worked very, very hard. But, she had no money to buy material. Then she began to collect trash. That's when people started calling her crazy. She lived in a shed that belonged to her brother. But that was it, because the family left her completely. She was alone, she had no one. Sorry to ask you, but... how did she die? She was found. In a field near here. Nobody knows how she died. I think she had died a long time. No one knows who burned it. Maybe she did it before she died, or maybe someone who didn't agree with her way of doing things. - Can I keep this? - Yes, you can. I think she never forgot Chile. No, of course not. “Any woman born with great gift in the 16th century would certainly have gone crazed, shot herself, or ended her days in some lonely cottage outside the village, half witch, half wizard, feared and mocked at.” 16th century? The character Ana and the letters exchanged between fine artists may be similar to reality, but they are fiction. A fiction created so that we could better reach the Latin American reality. - I was only seven, just seven. What seven? I wasn't even five. Suddenly voices in the street shouted at me: Black! Black! Black! Black! Black! Black! Black! And by any chance am I black? I said. - Yes! And what is it to be black? - Black! I didn't know the sad truth that it hid. - Black! And I felt black. - Black! As they said. - Black! And I stepped back. - Black! As they wanted. - Black! But now, I'm back here. We are. And who are we? Women, so many and so diverse who learn early about fighting, About not giving in, about toil, about mourning and the strength of fighting. I wish my words would become antidote and, if allowed, have the gift of transmuting this pain. Away, the shot, the bible, the bullet, those closing eyes, this shutting mouth. If I could go back, I'd go back. - Black! If I could go back, I'd go back. - Black! If I could go back, I'd go back. - Black! If I could go back, I'd go back. and get you, Dora, off the torture. And I wouldn't let Claudia, you on the asphalt, be dragged. And no coward cop, Luana, beat you up like that. And in your head, Marielle, those damn four bullets, I swear, wouldn't get in. And never again would one man pay tribute to another who tortured. And never again, in our face, would a man pay tribute to another who tortured. I keep looking for what I am, and to be me, I bleed and I know that many women came before us. And the wisdom that has been hinerited to us is in our mothers, in the mad, renegade. Hail Marys, Magdalenes, arched Joans, in the goddesses Orixás, Isis, Juremas, Dianas, Oxuns and Yemanjás, Euás, Obás, in our old grandmothers. In that valley of tears and mud in the old woman's eyes. Agô. Mercy, forgiveness, Saluba Nanã. We keep searching and in the midst of uncertainties and all that is to be done and transformed, We still dream of a country, a place where you can grow, you can live, thrive holding hands with freedom and the joy of being what we are. They have not won yet. We are alive! - Alive! We are alive! - Alive! Tomorrow will be another day. There will be nothing, no. Not as long as there is poetry and struggle. Not while in our chest a heart beats. Freely inspired by the play “There is more future than past”
