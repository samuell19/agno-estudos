She mumbled. She doesn't understand messing around. Mr. Khon is generous, don't pay attention. Invite distinguished guests to the party. Knock, knock, knock. Type something. Are you very hungry? Enter the party. Get out. Very beneficial indeed. I'll go there first, Mr. Hao! Terribly hot. People like Khun Fat are extremely honorable. Her last game make him lose face. Just join the party. Come over and invite him for a few drinks. This name Hao increasingly ignore us. What did he bring today? rose something to come, wants to make us lose face. That woman, I really don't know how good it is. What is the man's name? It's like being enchanted, keep staring at her all the time. I'm talking about Hao! She kept talking about that woman. Are you crazy jealous? Mr. Khon! Why don't you love me anymore? Her father, her mother, her brother, her brother, even dogs and cats, cockroaches are all raised by me, Is that still not enough? Mr. Khon! I know you're good to me. But women see the man I love spend all day looking at other women, I'm sure I'll be jealous. I mean, whatever is good, only small things not generous at all. As a man, sometimes joking is also commonplace. Do you like jealousy? let me buy ten jars of vinegar, let me have a drink do you want? Don't want to. Who's that? Bathing is not quiet anymore. Mr. Khon! What? Dragon General of the Golden Triangle region seriously ill, probably not going to recover. His son Ba Sa wants to go to Hong Kong renegotiate terms with the buyer. We already know. Quick preparation welcome guests. Yes. Mr. Kun, what's going on? Dragon General of the Golden Triangle, heard of serious illness, there is news that he's about to go. His son, Major General Ba Sa coming to Hong Kong, Negotiate new terms with the buyer. New conditions. So do they want more money? How much money doesn't matter, as long as we are exclusive, give a little more we also agree. If only we were exclusive, what about the other three families? Theretofore Everyone must come and beg me. Mr. Khon is awesome. Her head is great. Until then, really. certain blood and blood everywhere, A lot of people will die, you know. Position... So what to do? Or let's think about it. Consider what. As long as we are exclusive, no matter how many people die. I don't care. Especially Hao! Until then, I want him to kneel down and beg. Mr. Khon is too useful. [Nine Yin and Yang Yuan Tang Wei] Did he come so early? Heard recently I'm trying to show off. I just want to quickly gain trust by Lei Wan Hao, soon complete the mission. You shouldn't help them make potions. I need to know if the insider is doing illegal activities, will also be convicted. That night was an emergency. Sir please see as That's the gray area. Rose! Actually, I don't want you to do the internal work. I'm not really sure at all. Boss Cao! We should just talk about public affairs. Rose! Maybe you understand my mood right now. In 1 year of training you. Me to you, I... I know. But now, I just give my full attention to my work. I don't want to talk about love. So that, I hope you don't bring this up again in the future, okay? Okay. I'm right. I acted on emotion. I will investigate carefully Loi Wan Hao's criminal evidence! Fast find evidence about his bribery. Then let you guys clean up a batch. We have another thought. How? Currently there is a conflict between Fat Kun and Lei Wan Hao growing bigger and bigger. We are in the midst of strife, to expose them to more loopholes. We'll take them one by one. As I thought, The name Khon Ma for Lei Van Hao quite shy. But Lei Wanhao very humble before Fat Kun! Maybe he's always thinking about the past was once a junior of Khun Fat, therefore not directly opposed. In short, the more conflicts between them, the more we benefit. I will definitely try to separate them. Yes. Rose! Be careful. Hero! Are you worshiping your ancestors? Who are you worshiping? Have a glass of wine with me. Yes. Dai Uy, Tieu Uy! Yes. Burn all this then go home. Yes. You must have known before that I used to follow Fat Kun! I know. He is hostile cruel again. I am his close assistant often forced to work things do not matter. He didn't want that either. Then I want to leave. I told him I wanted to start a gambling business. There will be no conflict with him, he reluctantly let me go. But unexpectedly, Tieu of the four clans suddenly died, so everything changed. What is it? Western rulers want to find people Instead of Mr. Tieu, he chose Khun Fat! Fat Kun knows I respect him for helping definitely won't betray him, That's why I recommended you. The result is, I became one of the four clans. Those who were killed by Fat Wisdom It's not related to me though but every month I burn votive papers for them let yourself feel lighter. Things that happened then forget it think no more. Now in the gypsy He is the most popular person. And Mr. Khon so many enemies. So He is the head of the four clans. But a year ago, I found out more and more Fat Kun overbearing, to the point of dehumanization. Absolutely give no one a way to live. Want to deal with him there is only one way. What way? In the past, there were a few Western officers very itchy eyes before the actions of the Fat Man! That's why I want to have a place to control him. So will you do the same? Had to wait for a good time. But this time will come very soon. - Hi. - Hi. Major General. Why did you come with so few people this time? I don't want other people's attention. Major General said, I don't want many people to know his coming to Hong Kong! That's right. A little safety is good. Major General. This time prepare for you six beauties to keep company with. Wish you have fun playing. Please. Major General. I offer you a drink. Hopefully later We cooperate favorably. Major General. This is 400,000 yuan Please feel free to spend the next few days. It has nothing to do with sales. Major General. We invited the best chef prepare dinner for you, We will dine here shortly. Major General. Actually know a little Chinese, Just can't communicate. His stomach is a bit upset today so I don't want to have dinner. Major General, want to go to rest soon. Tomorrow will discuss with Mr. But, he hopes to have someone to keep him company. Okay. All six of these All can accompany the Major General. I want her. I? I can't, I can't. I'm... She is my cousin. If the Major General likes her then I let her stay with you. Mr. Khon! Em... Don't say many words. Just stay. Serve the major general for good. Don't bother the Major General anymore. We apologize. Mr. Khon! Mr. Khon! Hello. Hello. I don't play games. Obediently company with the major general. If it makes him unhappy I will sell you to Nam Duong to strip dance. But... I am your man. Older brother... Aren't you a little jealous? When you followed me Not even a queen of flowers. I just think of him as an ex-boyfriend. Older brother... Are you really not paying attention? No problem. After the event is successful. I will give you a 5 carat diamond. You say it. Okay. Major General. Mr. Khon! Coincidence? Ah Hao, why is this by chance? I've already discussed it with the Major General. Major General? Have you met Mr. Kun? This man is a lieutenant general. Yesterday I picked him up, We also talked all night. The contract has been signed, I just wanted to find you to discuss. Invite. Let's go. The elevator is broken. Broke your head. Mr. Khon? Where's the person? Major General Have you been looking for him? Hold on. It's okay. This time Mr. Khon was hooked. People are not revealed to the outside, quietly investigate which side is it. After checking out then give it to Mr. Khon handled. Ah Hao, you signed an exclusive contract with the brigadier general, So we don't do anything anymore. How can that be? I have left three great families, 20% each. Mr. Khon then get an extra 5% 25% total, more than the other two families. I do housework Only take 35%. Mr. Khon satisfied yet? Okay. This Ah Hao you and I are brothers, Whatever you say, that's it. You also know Mr. Khon here never been narrow-minded. Of course. Satisfied yet? Is everyone satisfied? Mr. Khon, I'm sure you're satisfied now. Very good, I have to visit my father, hope his health is better. Major General has to visit his father. Bye everyone. Bye. Bye. Bye. [Police Office] It's no use getting angry. The goods in A Hao's hands are all sold out. What time is it? but still not coming back? Absent all morning, never go to meetings. I ignore. If this and you won't come out for me, Wait until I turn my back on A Hao then don't blame me. What are you two doing in my office? Where are you going? 5 a.m. yesterday I was invited out for coffee by the bastard from the Independent Commission Against Corruption, Just released here. Isn't it? Did they dare to touch you? So we definitely run without escape. You guys have to get ready invited to drink their lousy coffee. Goldberg, Ah Hao stole my source of goods, you have to show me to get it back. Fat Wise, this is the board that built the boat, how can i help you? For the past few years he covers the sky with one hand in the gangster world, Want to monopolize? Enemies are many, reputation is bad, if you win the monopoly Definitely fighting every day. Then we have to be busy again. Ah Hao has good character, friends are many. Know that he works as a housekeeper Everyone speaks well of him to me. More he's not bad for you. The part he gave you no different than before. What else do you want to mess with? That said how many people help A Hao? Must to. I, Hunt and the four inspectors all support him. Several people. What are we? Mr. Khon, peace of mind, peace of mind. Must to. Just let A Hao work for a few more years. That's right. Now we mainly have to deal with the Independent Commission Against Corruption, Can't fight on the same side? Must to. I went before. A few more days go drink. Yes. Hero! Hero! Hero! The two of you enjoy a delicious meal. We will wait outside. Why is this place? No guests at all? Isn't it good to be quiet? This is your unopened nightclub. Why are you so strange today? Hero, Looks like he's happy today. Now the goods of the whole port are in your hands, Fat Kun can no longer cover the sky with one hand. Later he will also be less aggressive, Gypsy will be much more peaceful. No. Which day still drugs The day was still not peaceful. Do I really think so? Now he was the head of the four great clans. Fat Wise will recover? Surely he will create more trouble. As I see the next person he will deal with It's you. You are not afraid of him. But you will lose, because I remember my old love, but he never give up. He will definitely kill you. According to what I say Do you have to go first to take advantage? Or withdraw from the gypsy, Leave Hong Kong! Please enjoy. If you don't like it what i just said Just pretend I didn't say anything. I'm right, I want to make Fat Khun less raging is an impossibility. So It's time to decide. I know today you invite me to dinner What is the purpose? Not to celebrate for monopolizing the source of goods? It's more important than this. I want to tell you that I like you. Hero... I like you? Are you scaring me out of my mind? Hero, you okay? No problem. Want to follow. Yes. Unexpectedly, he took the first move to take the real advantage. Hero, Can we have a couple of chats? What happen? Since childhood I grew up in the gang, I have also seen him in danger many times. I know a person who climbs higher the more dangerous it will be. I don't want my man every night I have to wait at home for him, I don't know if he can come back. If you like someone, I just want to have a peaceful life with him. I know for you, leave this throne is a very difficult decision. Because of you withdraw from the gypsy, is that Okay? Please give me a little more time. Really lucky. Now what? also decided by A Hao. We Just obediently listen to the boss. He tells us to laugh and laugh, tell us to dance, dance, treats us like his dogs. How can that be? Mr. Khon! Older brother forever our ambassador. No problem. I am disadvantaged but also to pretend no problem, and told him to think for me. Give A Hao ten livers He also dare not disrespect Mr. I said yes yes. He's my dog, Now climb on top of me and sit down. If it was you can you hold it? Now you two each person suffers 5% damage, do you recover? Not sorry? Of course not. It's just the brigadier general gave him the monopoly, our brothers also gave up. Right. Now the source of goods is exclusively owned by A Hao. If in this world no more Ah Hao, if i get the source back how do you guys see? Theretofore I will share A Hao's share into three equal parts, Your stakes will increase. two of us small business. Everything All follow the boss's arrangement. So who is the boss? Of course, Mr. Khon is the big brother. That's good. I decide, if you don't follow me or sided with A Hao, at that time Don't blame me for not being lenient. Of course not. Of course not. Sister-in-law, Mr. Khon is discussing business, you are not allowed in. Remember? Remember, Mr. Khon! That's good. Let's go. Mr. Khon! What are you still here for? It's been ten days that you haven't noticed me. That's not my fault. It's not her fault, but i hate it. Now I see you is hate from head to toe, hate inside and out. I don't want to see her again. You want to sleep with that major general yourself? I was never satisfied, It's because you forced me. How do you know he's a fake major general? Must to. I told her to go with him, but can't you be a little reserved? I've only been down for 20 minutes, when it was up... She must have plunged into his lap, extremely hungry. You don't know play hide and seek with him, pretending to be ashamed of something? So I went up there. You blame me. What if I blame her? You dare hit me? You're wrong. Mr. Khon! Mr. Kun, please forgive me. No matter how she washes it, it can't be cleaned. Fat Wise! Damn you! There will be a day I can't even make you want to live, It's not enough to want to die. - 5. - 5. - 10. - 10. Change it for me. No need anymore. - Quack. - Quack. - What song is that? - Was it wrong? Is there a problem with this post of yours? An Huy, unlucky today. It's been ten days. Loan 8000 VND. An Huy, you borrowed me more than 8000 dong already. So what? Isn't my Dai Uy's name worth tens of thousands of dong? You can't borrow money from me anymore. But there's someone who wants to meet you. If that person nods I'll lend you as much as you want. Who? Any. Mr. Khon! Lose a lot of money? Take it and spend. Mr. Khon! I can't get this money. Sit down. I know you advanced next year's salary at A Hao's place. Accountant won't give you any more money. Why do you know that? Things I want to know then you will know. I thought you were very brave. What does Mr. Khon say? You and A Hao have known each other for so many years that Rose climbed on top of you. Now he is just running errands. Mr. Khon, Don't break up my relationship with Mr. Hao! Everyone knows what happened in club that night. Right. Ah Hao is really lucky. It's just I won't stop. Why? 5 million. Plus 1/3 of A Hao's area! You don't have to do anything. time to show up, You just have to be 20 minutes late. Yes. Lawyer Van, later thanks to you. Mr. Hao rest assured, I will definitely deal with it. I'm not saying goodbye. Do not formal. - Please come over here. - Yes. Little Uy! Yes, Mr. Hao! Come here. I want to tell you one thing. Sit down. Yes. Why is Dai Uy so rare these days? I do not know. Has he been unwell lately? Did he go to Macau again to play cards? No, I installed people in Macau, If he goes there, someone will notify me immediately. Brother whatever, Just addicted to gambling. Unlike you, Having money is saving to buy a house. Normally, I was well taught by Mr. Hao. Actually I want to talk to you one more thing. I plan to retire. Hero, now he is the head of the four great clans, at the shining peak, Why do you want to take a break? I'm retired will not need to look at the attitude of the Westerners and Inspector Hoa too. Being human is more fun. What about Mr. Hao's business? I have advised Lawyer Van, the business entrusted to him with Dai Wei, I will not withdraw capital, two people can continue to do. Now I just hope Rose is willing to be with me Go to Europe! Hero, I have never seen him so serious. I'm sure Ms. Rose will agree. I've been thinking about you guys. you guys do less work deliver the rest for Fat Wise and Hua Zi Rong unconditionally, then you can continue. Actually with my current wealth It's not enough to eat for three lifetimes Why compete with others? I already thought, use the remaining time to go around the world, work that makes me happy isn't it better? Hero, I am very happy for you. Go and discuss with Dai Uy. Okay. So you go first, Mr. Hao! Miss Rose, congrats, congratulate her. What did he congratulate me on? Boss Cao! What a coincidence, I'm looking for you today too that you already contacted me. I have something important want to talk to you. I also have, she said first. Lei Wan Hao intend to withdraw. He gives his business to his subordinates, then left Hong Kong alone. Alone? Did he leave Hong Kong with you? Why do you know that? He used your passport to book hotels and airline tickets in half of Europe already, Why can't we investigate? Lei Wan Hao already reformed the rules, Why can't we give him a chance? Regulatory reform. I told her, Fat Kun decided to set a trap to eliminate Lei Wan Hao! Tonight, he will date Lei Wanhao to my villa meeting with two other clans. Lei Wan Hao dead for sure. So you still don't want to stop him? These wicked men destroy each other, Why do we have to stop? Wait for them to fight until both sides break up we clean up the mess, Shouldn't it be less work? Can not. Rose, she broke the rules, has feelings for Lei Wan Hao, I now dismiss her, wait for internal processing. You come back with us. Right. I like Lei Wan Hao, but he already has repentance. More many years ago he saved my life. I can come home with you today, too. But make sure to tell him told him not to come to the meeting tonight. Not allowed to tell him, This is an order. Flower Tu Vinh, don't mess around. Why do you still want to play the new way? Hero! Hero! His glory! Hero! He wished! Mr. Khon! Sorry, I'm late. Hero, now you are the big brother, It should be a little late. Sit down and talk. Get a glass of wine for Mr. Hao. It's not often that tonight you're full, shallow cup. Okay, First of all, I wish you Kun good health, Money is like water. Then wish Mr. Vinh and Mr. Chuc have enough money and beauty. Any, shallow cup. Shallow cup. OK.
