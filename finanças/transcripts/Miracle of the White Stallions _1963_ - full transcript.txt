In the alpine part of Austria lies the village of Piber, home to Lipizzaner horses. Lipizzaner farming began in 1580. During the reign of Maximilian II. From then until the end of the Empire, white horses served as crowns. Today they belong to the Austrian people. They are valued as a living symbol of wonderful times which have passed and will never return. THE MIRACLE OF THE WHITE STEPHENS At the end of their third year, when the Lipizzaners turn from dark to white, the best stallions are selected for the Spanish Riding School in Vienna. Named after the Spanish origin of the Lipizzaners, it was built in 1735. when every court in Europe was a patron of classical riding. Today, it is the only home of that art in the world. She survived wars and occupations, crowns and republics. At the end of World War II it was almost lost. In the spring of 1945, a great adventure for Vienna's white horses began . General Tellheim, this is a pleasant surprise. Colonel Podhajsky, do you remember General Stryker? Of course, I remember him very well. Forgive me for not calling my staff, but the military atmosphere would disrupt the concentration necessary for our ?? training. - I see. General Stryker arrived only this morning and one of the first wishes she was to see his Spanish riding school. - We're honored. I'm a big fan of Lipizzaners. I've always wanted to see them in his visits to Vienna. Then you have to come to our ?? tomorrow's performance. The first is in a few months. I understand. What happened here, Colonel Podhajsky? - Happened? That. It doesn't look the same. Was there not a portrait of Charles VI above the gallery? And I remember the magnificent chandeliers. - I had them removed. Did you have orders to do that, Colonel? I gave the colonel permission to take certain precautions. Those things are irreplaceable. I was worried about their safety. That's what it means. Worried about their safety? Can you explain to me so many empty sections in the stables? I sent younger stallions to the village. You sent a request to Berlin to move a riding school from Vienna? Yes, some time ago. - That was rejected? - That's right. I was very disappointed. Then why did you decide to ignore it? If I had ignored no one would have been here. The horses I sent more ?? were in training. They are not trained for performances. You have made decisions that are against the Führer's will. Vienna is not in danger. Life must go on as usual. You can't believe ... - It's an order! Papers of the Spanish riding school? You have several riders on vacation. They must return to active service immediately . Do you want to continue the work of the school, and you take my staff? It takes humanity at the front. - General, the basis of the school is training! I sympathize with your problem, Colonel, but the war is culminating. I will tell you in confidence that it will not be easy. It will take the sacrifice of all if we want Germany to win. I look forward to tomorrow's performance. Heil Hitler. You there! That horse needs to hit you ?? what does it give him ?? confusing signals. And then let him hit me for letting you in here. He didn't yell at you. You're just a replacement. Will you look at how I work? If I do something wrong you correct me. Aloise? - Yes. Something wrong? - Yes. Something is wrong. - What is it? I don't allow childish outbursts of emotion in the riding hall. And who has them? - Me? I was sent out. I yelled at the young rider . You should have heard me. A conscientious boy. One of the best. If he's one of the best, he 'll outlive your temper. Have a coffee. - I have to praise him tomorrow. How are the Nazis so stupid? Do they believe in their crazy propaganda? Yeah, Nazis. - Yes, they are always Nazis. I feel like the Nazis have been around my whole life. The school should be closed and evacuated and that no one from Berlin stops me. Mo ?? e ?? ask to leave town and just ask. That's all. You're in the military, and the school is under military control, and that's it. Is the opera under military control? Or a symphony? Maybe Vienna will be spared as much as Paris. I have to prepare to leave Vienna. Arbitrarily, if necessary. But, Aloise, don't even think about it. - I have to ensure the survival of the school. And personal survival? - School is my responsibility before the Nazis and it remains my responsibility. - There are limits ... - My first responsibility! I will continue to try to get permission and pray that they come to their senses, but if they don't listen to me and time runs out ... - I don't want to hear that. Vedena, must ?? to realize... Europe will be fragmented. Only those who are willing to do something, who have a plan and the courage to do something will have a chance to save lives. School is my life and my obligation. I can’t turn around and forget her. Think about it, Vedena as I thought. Understands ??? I understand, yes. But I don't want to. Aloise, promise me you won't ?? endanger if that is not the only way. The last desperate way out. Don't forget ... You are my life. Only you. Wonderful wine! Wonderfully! My nephew knows good wine. - How could I not be with you, Uncle? I'm going back to my unit from a few years ago. It will be nice to see them. If they survived. Ba ?? nice story ??. - Yes, nice and cheerful. Let's all have a drink. After a couple of glasses, everything will be nice and cheerful. Before you know it, Otto will volunteer to go to the front. I've been thinking about it. You will need someone to wipe your noses. What an honor. - Good evening. Please sit at the head of the table. Try the wine too. It was a good year. - Nice to hear that. Good evening. - Good evening. - Harry's good for something. We're lucky you're here, Harry. It's perfect for me. What are you standing for? Sit down. "Colonel Podhajsky, we'd like a toast." When we first came to the Spanish riding school three years ago you said you would expect the best from us and you will not agree to anything less. As time went on we saw that you thought so. It was hard because I don't think any of us knew what was best. Nor where to look for it, but you kept looking. Until you made us find it. So thank you because we can take it with us now. Cheers! - Cheers! You were sent to a riding school on command. They didn't ask you if you wanted to, and they didn't give me a choice either. But the school was lucky. Must have because it is still ?? always there. That I was allowed to go through the whole cavalry and find the staff, I couldn’t have chosen better. Those who stay here will have to work harder than usual. Those returning to active service will surely be the pride of the units. Nedostajaæete nam. Good luck. They are good guys. Going to war is so pointless at this point. Aloise ... - Sorry, it's a party. We need Otto! - Yes! - Come on! Sing your favorite song. - I fell out of the mess. - That must not happen. Just say we'll meet again. Sutra. Samo reci goodbye. Veèeras. Don't say goodbye and don't despair. I know we'll meet again. Somewhere. Our dreams still will be there ... Sutra. Although tomorrow seems distant. Until the day when lives are found again and friends meet again, Just say Goodbye. Come on, play something cheerful. Bring her ?? wine. Open that door! Come on, keep running them. - Bring it here. Keep leading them. Let's go! Aloise! Aloise! I was so scared. - Prepare to leave Vienna. I'll go to Defense headquarters in the morning . I can't turn me down now. The general will see you now. How can I help you, Colonel Podhajsky? - I have a request. I want permission to move the Spanish riding school right away. Va ?? the request was denied. - That was before. It was this morning. I am in contact with Berlin. - Why would they refuse? Last month is one thing, even last week, but now? The Spanish riding school is a symbol of Vienna. Her relocation could be seen by the Viennese as a hopeless situation. That the city is doomed. It is an extravagant sacrifice , and I doubt that the Viennese can be so deceived. It is not up to me to question the decisions of superiors. I have a responsibility, General. - That's right, the responsibility of anyone in uniform. Obey orders. Heil Hitler! Regiment. Podhajsky, I came to see the gene. Tellheim. - Do you have an appointment? I have not. - The general is very ... - It's urgent. I want to report a conspiracy against gen. Stryker. What did you tell my clerk? He is very impressed with you. He stutters when impressed. - It's not hard to impress people these days. You just talk very loud and you are embarrassed. Did you impress General Stryker? - I am not. He is an exception. The request was denied. Any request. All requirements. I'm sorry. I can't believe such a search, such nonsense ... - Don't say that! Don't tell anyone what you think. In these times, that is not smart. Forgive me on nature. The mares from the school were moved to Czechoslovakia, for reasons incomprehensible to me. I don't know what will happen to them. Now airstrikes threaten my stallions, and they won't let me save them. It is as if the end of school was deliberately planned and is now being carried out according to some secret schedule from the top. I don't know how polite and patient he will be. If only I could call Berlin and get you something. There have been too many changes since the assassination attempt on Hitler . I have no friends left there. - I know. Thanks for listening to me. Again. Just a second. Some time ago I ordered you to take the artwork out of school. For sure. This command has not been revoked. Can you help me with transportation? Where would you like to take those works of art? - In Sv. Martin in Innkreis. There are many places and a castle. Perfect for accommodating artwork. There are few trucks , but I'll see what I can do. I'll send you trucks. - Or a carriage, if there are no trucks. My Lipizzaners will help me with this evacuation. I'll help you as much as I can. Then it's up to you. You know I could set a trap for you. I'm willing to take a risk. Careful, my friend. Do you want us to wait for you? - Go with trucks and carriages. I'll come with the rest. I 'll meet you at the train station. Do you know what your orders are if they stop you? - Yes. I hope we don't use them. I'm nervous about the police. Colonel Podhajsky? We are ready to go. What's going on here? - I'm Colonel Podhajsky from the Spanish Riding School. - Check all the carriages! I evacuate artwork and valuable equipment from school. Let's get to the railroad. Do you have orders? - Signed by the commander of the Aryan defense. Your wife? - Yes. - Helping you evacuate? I don't like leaving her alone. Why do you have horses tied to carriages? These are the animals that perform. They're not used to towing. I brought extra horses to make it easier for them. Furniture, paintings, saddles and reins. What you are doing is very dangerous, Colonel. - I understand that. I wouldn't like to see these beautiful animals caught in the attack. You better keep going. Quickly. - Thank you. I talked to the shipper. It is hopeless. A few trains are leaving. There is great damage on the west line. It is not hopeless. Never. Where is? - Over here. Come with me. Move 70. - I'm Colonel Podhajsky. - Transfer them if you have to. But move them! - I have a transport order. - I told you it was impossible. You didn't tell me anything. - It's impossible anyway . - But I have orders. Who doesn't? - You won't get rid of me, I promise! Colonel, I have a hundred orders I can't keep. They are all urgent. Soldiers, equipment, and you want a wagon for art. ?? elim ?? is vagona. - ??East? I can't leave until you help me. - I'm very busy. I don't care about myself, I care about horses. - Horses? Your order covers the transport of certain goods. And what are the treasures of the Spanish riding school? Real treasures? It's not up to me. I can't help you. Not even your horses. Are you Austrian? - Yes I am. - Then your horses are as big as mine. Don't try to use sensitivity on me. There is no place for that. - Not sensitivity, harsh reality. Something irreplaceable is in danger of destruction. You'll make me call the police! Your children? - Yes, they are. Very beautiful. So eager look. It's like they know tomorrow will be a good day. Are they here in Vienna? - No, I sent them on. Out of danger. Good. I was relieved. Colonel Podhajsky, I beg you again! Have they seen Lipizzaners? - Yes, they saw them! They love them as much as I do! Why don't you accept no as an answer? You're putting me in a terrible position. I look at the table and see hundreds of commands which I cannot fulfill! But because of you, I also see the faces of my children. A man should never lose sight of something. Where will he go ??? - The horses are restless. Like you. Must?? to fall asleep. - When we come to Sv. Martin. Take it easy, kid. Take it easy! The plane! Vedena, get off the train! - No, I'm staying! Vedena, ne budi luda! They just pass. - They're just turning. Have they passed! Sometimes you're so stubborn. - You taught me. It's so quiet here it makes me nervous. We are used to noise. Where is Otto? - He went for a walk. He was born in Linz. Until a few days ago, the war was just a radio report. A few inconveniences. Suddenly, now ... It still seems unreal to me. Why are they coming back? There is nothing left! We stayed. Unbutton, you have to detach! Unbutton, you have to detach! You think you had to tell me that? - Hurry up! Hurry up! Separate! Wait for me! - We're not going anywhere! We are left to be killed like sheep. Is it all over? How long do we have to stay here? - Until I get a move order. So long. - Not really? safe place. From whom do you receive orders? - Of all. I'm tired of it already. Unbutton and detach! - He won't stop until he has leveled everything. Murder is to leave us here. - We can't risk the train! What are you waiting for ?! - I didn't bring a Spanish riding school to Linz to destroy it. - The Spanish riding school is on my train? In several carriages. - My wife and I watched your beautiful horses every time we traveled to Vienna. - Are you crazy ?! This is an attack, and you're talking about horses! Unbutton and detach! You can't just leave us! Otto, we need to get the horses out of here. - Where are we going? - I do not know. Any ... Take us with you. Take us with you! What are you doing ?! Stop! I order you to stop! Stop! During the last weeks of the war, the castle in Sv. Martin it was a refuge for hundreds of homeless and frightened people. As well as for the Spanish riding school in Vienna. The days were long and filled with waiting. Easy with your hands. Stop him! What's the matter? - Thief! He broke into the warehouse. - I just took blankets. - And a saddle. Help! Don't kill me! Someone help me! Quietly! Nobody touches you. - My wife and child are freezing. What should I do? Are they freezing? By this time? - It's cold at night. We have to sleep on the floor. - Will the saddle keep you warm? See if it's missing yet ?? net. What are you doing to him? Did he hurt you, bro? - I just wanted blankets. A man must take care of his family. - Yes, my children are freezing! A few moments ago, you only had one child. You should not bother the poor. You are not needed here. - The gun is also missing . - I didn't take the gun! I swear! I don't know anything about the gun! Search me! Come on, get out! All! We have to set up a day and night guard. Think of some kind of signal. They'll decorate everything we have for barter. I'll make a shift schedule. - Give everyone a gun and ammunition. Don't forget someone outside has a gun. Aloise? Aloise? What's going on outside? - Otto caught a thief in the stables. What did you do to him? - We let him go. What could we do? Hand it over to the authorities? I am a fugitive to the authorities. We could not wait for the safety of St. Martina. Colonel Podhajsky, military car. We'll have an important visitor, it seems. - Let's go upstairs. Alois, isn't it ??? - No. Is there a reason ?? what attracts ?? take care of yourself? I'll go out and say goodbye! I can not believe it! What brings you to Sv. Martin? I finally got permission to leave Vienna. How fast can you do that? It's a pleasure to see you. General Tellheim, please come in. You were right, Aloise. A very important visitor. Countess, let me introduce you to General Tellheim. The Countess generously opened the door of her home to us. - I'm honored. The general is a good friend from Vienna. Welcome to Sv. Martin, General. His visit is a big surprise. How did you manage to leave the office? Confusion is everywhere these days. I don't think they'll miss me either. In that case, you have to stay for dinner. I don't want to bother. - I insist. I'll take care of it. - Thank you. A wonderful woman. - Yes, and next to you the busiest person in Austria. I see there are a lot of people here. - I can't even count the refugees who came to Sv. Martin every week, and she takes care of them. Where is her husband? In the army? No, he did not agree with the authorities. He is in a concentration camp. That's what it means. Come in, please. Sit down. Tell me what happened to you. Don't pretend in front of me. Actually ?? he wants ?? you know what about the school. Is it so easy to read me? The hall is still intact and looks the same. I'm glad to see you and I love you more and more every moment. Wonderfully. Thank you. - It was my pleasure. I don't have many opportunities to play. You know, we just broke the law. That. Mendelssohn's music is banned. I forgot. - Of course it is. Who can remember such things? Cognac is excellent. Like wine with dinner. I'm not used to such good things. They all disappeared in Vienna or are very well hidden. We dug them up, General. Literally. Under the floor in the wine cellar. As well as dishes and utensils. Vedena and I dug it up all afternoon. You've worked hard. - But it's good to have guests and music again. I have always loved Mendelssohn. I played The Cradle Song as a boy. What will happen to the country that is the reason for that? Forbid the genius of a great composer. What will happen to her people? Which allowed himself to be so deprived. You may be too strict with them. This condition does not happen overnight. It develops slowly and so subtly that people don't even realize what happened. Gives. Suddenly it's all there. Then it will be too late to retaliate. At least that's what weak people say. I think you are too mild. Strong people fight in spite of everything. They take a risk. For what they believe. I admire them. I envy them. ?? this as they happen ... Gives. I think I have to go. This has been a wonderful evening. I completely lost track of time. Forgot what time it is , what year it is! Thank you for that. - Thank you. It was worth more than I can describe. I hope to see you again. Think of me sometimes. You don't even have to ask for it. Now I would like more ?? once see my lovely Lipizzaners. Of course. - Goodbye. In fact, he was his own enemy. General Tellheim, you've already done so much for school , I'm ashamed to ask for more, but I'm worried about mares in Czechoslovakia. I wonder if something can be done before it's too late. It's too late. Save the request for conquerors. I brought very bad news. I delayed saying them for selfish reasons. This was a pleasant visit. - What news? The Hungarian riding school escaped from Budapest. They were captured by the Russians near Vienna. The neighborhood? - The fall of Vienna is inevitable. Maybe it already happened. What happened to Hazlinsky and his horses? Do you know? He and his staff are prisoners of war. They were in uniform. The horses were destroyed. - I see. We talked so much about the end. They were expecting him. They waited. But it's still a shock when he comes. Can I do more ?? one thing for you. My last good deed. I can demilitarize the school. Maybe it'll make things easier for you. When the conquerors take over. - I would be very grateful. All right, I'll send you official papers and declare the school a public institution. As it was before. You call it your last good deed? Gives. With the fall of Germany, my life ended. I thought a lot about my situation and I decided. I have neither the courage nor the desire to start over. More than that, I decided I didn't want to be convicted as a Nazi. I do not want to accept responsibility. You never cooperated with Hitler. No, I sold myself to him, like many others. I am faithful to the path I took many years ago. Weak road then. Weak path now. However, I chose it myself. With such a weak winter, we will have a beautiful spring. I doubt that the Russians will reach St. Martina. If that's any consolation to you, I think the Americans will come here. Should I expect more from them? Don't lose hope, my friend. Have?? the past that can ?? proud and chance for the future. Few of us have that many. Sorry I ruined a wonderful evening with those gloomy reports. General Tellheim, why don't you stay here for a while? The Countess would surely be happy ... - Receive more ?? a refugee? Not. Thanks for the offer. So ... Goodbye. I hope you do well. Before we leave, we will slam the door so hard that Europe will tremble! We are not leaving in surrender but to strengthen for greater battles! The Third Reich burns to ascend in its glorious destiny. No news? - The last cries of a dying monster. I want him to die, but I don't want to listen to him. Maybe tonight we'll have more luck with the British broadcast. I think they care about us. What do they care if we know the truth? They won! It's all over except a little cleaning here and there. You're in a bad mood because of the rain. Take it easy! You could accidentally shoot someone. If I shoot someone, it won't be an accident. Is it a killer under a mild exterior? I do not believe. Take the horses and run! - Stop or I'll shoot! Get him out of the way. That's right, Colonel, stay where you are. What are you doing with my horses? - We'll use them to get out of here. Before the Russians come. - He thinks?? that I will let you do that ?! You are not in command today, Colonel. Besides, we're doing you a favor. I hear Russians love horse meat. Don't waste energy running away from the Russians. They do not come to Sv. Martin. I didn't hear that. I heard they were already in Vienna. Are they moving in this direction? - Where are you going to run to? You better stay here. I don't think you care what happens to us, Colonel. Did you see that German officer a few days ago? He came from Vienna and told me what was going to happen. The Russians will not reach Sv. Martina! We may have listened to too many German officers. Hit that horse and I'll kill you! - Careful, Colonel. I'll shoot if I have to! Stop it! Everyone but my staff better get out of here. Quick! Settle the horses and stay with them. Help me take Otto home. I'm retiring now. - Don't talk. That doesn't sound like thunder. - It's not. These are the winners. Thank God, it's not a deep wound. - Is it worth it, Vedena? - What? All on ?? effort and care? You never asked that. - No. I'm stubborn. The truth is also stubborn. Katkad mora ?? to see things as they are. - How are they? I'm interested. - Just open your eyes and shut your eyes. Here come the conquerors! They take lives and destroy tradition without thinking. How does he know ?? What are they doing, Aloise? - Did you hear what happened to the Hungarians? It was one unit in the Russian army, that's all. Did you hear anything better about the other side? If it's not the worst, then it's close. The people I kept the school for will now destroy it. It's not true. - What happened a few hours ago? Someone takes a gun and they are ready to kill anyone in their path. Ready to steal all the stallions. Aloise? Must?? don't understand that. There are people in this world for whom a horse is just a horse. White, black or colorful. They are not a matter of beauty or culture. Just a horse! A means of transportation or maybe something to eat. There may be no place for tradition and art in the world to come. Maybe those things are superfluous. If so, then I am superfluous. Like Tellheim. A man whose time has passed and the world has disappeared. If so then I need to know. I need to open my eyes wide and recognize that. Yes, open them. Poor vision ??! But it is not blindness but short-sightedness. Mo ?? e ?? to see a desperate group of refugees as they approach and threaten you. But where are the others? All those who took risks trying to save the school. The train driver who brought us here? Freight forwarder at the train station. Otto, Sascha. Suddenly he doesn't see them ??? Compares ?? with Tellheim? That is uncounted. Poor Tellheim. He had nothing to catch. He had no reason to fight. So he gave up. But it's not you, Aloise! As long as he has a chance to continue the work of the school must?? to keep fighting. He owes ?? to the people in the background! I have it ?? something to catch on to besides school. Thank you. Open the door, please. - Yes, Countess. I'm looking for Colonel Podhajski. - I'm Podhajsky. I have orders for you, Colonel. - Commands? You will be the commander of the regional defense, Colonel. The people in the village are armed and waiting for your instructions. Commander? - As a soldier with the highest rank. But I'm not in the military anymore. I'm waiting for official confirmation. - This is an official confirmation, Colonel. I see. Remind everyone under your command that the war is not over. That the ideas of peace and surrender bring great punishments to the Americans. Do you have any questions? I don't have one. Mayor Altman will stay here with instructions. Mr. Altman, are you related to the butcher in the village? - Yes, I am. I wonder if there is a possible imminent danger of those rifles echoing. Imminent danger? - Yes. Danger of robbery. - Robbery ?! There are over 300 refugees here. The louder the rifles, the more restless they are. If their fear reached a climax it would turn into a rebellion you realize what would happen to everyone. - Yes, I understand. It would be a good idea to keep armed men close to the village, just in case. What do you think? - I agree, Colonel! Entirely! Fox. A cunning fox. He's going to get in trouble. I don't like what he's doing. What should I do? Let a bunch of sick and old people play soldiers? I don't want that on my conscience. - And the orders? I promise we won't see Kreisleiter again. I am no longer in the army, with or without written confirmation. I'm done with the Nazis once and for all! Bravo! My husband ?? he said I play like a carpenter. Sounds good to me. - Wait! Listen. I don't hear anything. - Exactly. The shooting stopped. What could that mean? Vedena, bring clothes for the staff. We need to take off our uniforms. Aloise? - Please go now, Vedena. Otto, burn the uniforms and get rid of the rifles we have in the stables. I don't want to explain them. - Yes sir. Is there anything I can do? I want to do something too. I feel like the world is turning twice as fast as tonight. If I don't hold on tight . I don't know what I mean. I know. I feel it too. Many hours of thinking and acting will soon be over . Welcome or not, it's an incentive. - Finally, the end. What will it be like? - Americans? - I do not know. We'll find out soon enough. They don't stop, they pass us. - Wait. Major Hoffman, find out who these people are and who the owner is. Hello, I'm Alois Podhajsky. - Are you the owner? No, the Earl of Arco-Valley is the owner. - Where is he? - He's not here. My husband is in a concentration camp. We would like to check your ?? home, Countess. As possible a seat. We would be honored to have an American headquarters in St. Martin. Will you show me? Major Hoffman, look at the other buildings. The stables are full of white horses! - Horses! - Let's take a look! Be patient! Hey, watch out! - I'm sorry. What's wrong, Otto? - All is well. An American official is looking for you. He knows your name. - Take me to him. I was sure it was the same Podhajsky. I'm Major Hoffman. I saw you at the 1936 Olympics as you would. Long ago. - It seems like a long time ago. But I remember your performance. I have never seen such riding. - Nice of you. These are your horses? - They're from a Spanish riding school. I read that you became a warden there. Before the war? - Jo ?? I always am. If anything is worth it. - Major Hoffman, we'll set up a seat here. Will you take care of the detachment moving in? - Yes sir! We'll put the vehicles in the barns, it looks like there's room. - Colonel ?! Podhajsky is the director of the Spanish Riding School. One of the best riders in the world. Famous Lipizzaners are here. How many horses do you have? -70. - Pretty animals. I haven’t seen their performance, but it’s a great experience. - They're unique. Did you bring them from Vienna? - For safety. - Wonderful. - General ... The Spanish riding school is worth saving, not only because of Austria but for the sake of the world. We need your protection. I'm sorry, Podhajsky. - We won't survive without her. We have 70 stallions to feed and defend. Our mares were transferred to Hostau in Czechoslovakia. If they don't come back to us, the breed will die out. Jo ?? we are always trying to win the war. When that is said, agencies will be set up for such requests. - Apologies for impatience, but those agencies may be late. I have no authority to grant military protection. As for the mare, a line has been agreed that the Americans will not cross. That line is the Czechoslovak border. The Russians will take Hostau. I respect your commitment to school. I'm sorry I can't help you. Well ... Don't you yet ?? give up. - I said too fast and I was direct. Just don’t give up. Aloise, dinner? - I'm not hungry. Podhajsky? Can we talk? I just talked to the general. I would like to help you and we have an idea. What kind? - Can you perform here in a short time? Appearance? - Yes, General Patton, Commander 3rd Army adores horses. He rode at the 1912 Olympics. If he became interested in school, he could do what no one else could. Save the mares? - I can't promise anything, but if they invited Patton to see the performance ... How can I perform something valuable under these conditions? Small staff, stallions are not trained. If you can't do ... - I didn't say that! I just said I don't know how. - Well, do you want to? That's an opportunity, is n't it? I need a chance. Good. I'll report to the military command tonight. - Major Hoffman? I want to thank you. You come to the city after so many sad cities. You enter the barn and see something beautiful. You don't expect that. It helps you forget not so beautiful things. Laku noæ, Podhajsky. Colonel? We'll perform. - Performance? Here? Perhaps the most important performance in the history of this school. For an American general who can help us. Wonderfully. When are we going to hold it? Jo ?? I do not know. Maybe a few days. Couple of days?! That is not possible. It will take weeks to prepare the horse. I don't know how we're going to make it. I'll tell you something. We went too far and survived too much to give up. We need the help of the Americans to save the school. We have to impress General Patton. - We need time! - He is gone! We can raise our hands, turn our heads and give up this opportunity or there will be no more performances. Nowhere! Do you want that? Let’s take this opportunity and thank God for it. Maybe she's the only one. The training program will begin early in the morning. Very early. I suggest you rest. Let's go, boys! Get up! What do you think this is ?! Let's go, let's go! No one gets up earlier than the US military. Nobody. Sascha, I want two rows of seats. Each row for ten people. I'll show you the plans. What's going on here? Some circus? - No, it's not a circus! It is a Spanish riding school from Vienna. What does a Spanish school do in Austria? We have a Spanish restaurant in Brooklyn. It is the oldest riding school in the world. The horses are really beautiful, ma'am. - Is it? If you want make friends smile. We need friends now. Watch them run. - Ask them for the next dance. Just know that they are lighter on their feet than girls at home. The school principal says he's glad Which can show horses to American liberators. He has a big job now. Make the place convenient, but when it’s over, stallions can perform for you. Maybe they will give you a happy memory of Austria. - Maybe we can help. Really?! That would be very kind. It will help us. See what he's doing now. We are freaks for them, Vedena. Street performance. I don't need their help. They are young. How do I know what riding school and tradition mean? They are willing to understand and are open to it. - I don't have time to teach them. I also don't like their jokes. He always mentions ?? your responsibility to the school. He thinks?? that your responsibility is just to be! It is also to give. - What is he doing ??? I don't want to argue with you, especially about this. This is very important. I've heard of people in war who killed and couldn't stop. Maybe you fought too long and he doesn't believe it ?? im too long. Leave the coffee, we'll help ourselves . How hot it was I could go to the village pump for water. You're too lazy for that. Good morning, Vedena. - Good morning. Aren't Americans wonderful? They have a passion for cleanliness. Yes, wonderful. - They find centuries-old dirt. I'm sorry it's going to go away. Something wrong? Tell me. We ask too much of our men. We ask them to have the strength and rage of giants, and then to change quickly. To be men again as before. But we have to ask for it. Is it? - It's our duty to them. Don't worry so much. - I have to think what will happen to him if the American general won't help. It's beautiful. I know the right place for them. Here. Now I can see without being seen. It's late! - He's so nervous. Like on our wedding day. Jo ?? up. I didn't know what to expect from you. Gene. Patton has a reputation. The guy came. Good luck! Attention! Attention! That? - Can we start? - Excuse me. Guys, you can get closer if you want. Sit down if you want. Move closer. Did you see ?! I've never seen a horse do that! That's how they do it when they fight. Didn't you see them fighting? He never saw a horse! A horse knows better than to go near Brooklyn. ??ta mu je? Maybe he has stomach problems. General, thank you for the great honor you have shown Spanish riding school. This cultural institution, deeply attached to Austrian soil and heart, the oldest riding school in the world, has survived centuries of war. Certainly a great American nation that came to save European culture interested in what is living proof of the Baroque. I think I'm doing the right thing by asking you for protection and help. School protection and search and retrieval assistance Lipizzaner mares that are now in danger in Czechoslovakia. Thanks for the good performance. Will you join me on a tour of the stables? Of course. Attention! Did he say yes or no? I didn't hear. - It's not. How much do you need to train a horse, Podhajsky? Before they are ready to perform for three to four years. It's amazing that you put so much time and energy into something like this in the middle of the war. - We want to preserve our values. - A valuable idea. If you can afford it. Do you use mares? - No, only stallions work, and mares are used for breeding. That is why it is necessary to return them. There are no others. The Germans switched them some time ago. Good job, Podhajsky. Congratulations! Gentlemen, let's go to lunch. What did he say? - He said he was hungry. Attention! - At ease. The dining room is there. - Before that, I want to see a map of Czechoslovakia. I'll get a draft of the area. - Over here, sir. I received a message from the commander of the second cavalry at the beginning of the week. I was informed of 2,000 Allied prisoners at the Czech border. They are used to care for a large herd of horses. - Excuse me. That's it, sir. It is outside the agreed line. But I wasn’t for that line. I want to see those prisoners released before the Russians come. I want a communication center for that purpose. If conditions permit, Commander Reed can lead the horses. There is no point in leaving them to the Russians. - All right, sir. Attention! I will contact General Eisenhower, he has authority over Patton. Please eat no ... - I'll contact the American president. Please eat! You didn't have breakfast, and you did a show. We performed well despite everything, but for what? - Please... I'm not hungry. - Aloise ... - Don't pull me! Podhajsky? - Did General Patton have lunch? Is she in good health? The Spanish riding school is now under the protection of the US military. By order of General Patton. The other cavalry goes to Hostau. We are. What I said ... I'm sorry , I was upset. You asked how healthy he was. There is nothing wrong with that. When are they leaving for Hostau? - The order was sent to Colonel Reed, I leave in the morning. The colonel's primary concern is 2,000 prisoners. Get to them and set them free. I will be able to solve everything else that comes up. Like the Lipizzaners, for example. I would love to be a part of that. - I can arrange for you to meet us at the border. If we do not encounter resistance, the operation should take a few days. Couple of days? Did you hear, Vedena? I heard! Wait, who's going ?! "Captain Danhoff of the German Army." I am responding to a message from your commander, Colonel Reed. What is the password? - Cowboy. You didn't say that ?? best, but good. Let's go. Forward. Good evening, Major Hoffman. - Hello, Colonel. - Have some coffee. Thank you. Any news from the Germans? - Jo ?? not. I make up for the meal. It's like I'm always late. This is not like home. I would order ham with sauce and peas . Corn bread. He knows ?? What I order, you're a Southern guy. - Texas. Close enough. Have you tried closing your eyes? Closed or open is still military food, Major. You can't ignore, disguise or run away. The only nightmare we'll all take from the war. Forward. Colonel Reed, a German soldier from Hostau has arrived. Bring him in, Sergeant. - Yes sir. We need to give this to them so we can see how strong they are. He may accuse us of unfair warfare. Captain Danhoff, sir. Captain Danhoff, I'm glad you agreed to my call. Major Hoffman. I believe that the conversation can be mutually beneficial. Please have a seat. I'll continue dinner if you don't mind. You can join me. - No, thank you, sir. I hear you have a large number of Allied prisoners in Hostau. Yes, most are French and English. - I'm interested in their release. I thought I'd make a little deal. Agreement? - I guess they would rather surrender to us than to the Russians. My suggestion is very simple. If you surrender peacefully, we will enter Hostau and the Russians will not be able to look for you. Will you take us out of Czechoslovakia? - Like American prisoners of war. What about our wives and property? - I'll be as generous as I can be. I'll explain to my people. He wants conviction. We won't bargain, Captain. I have no other belief. I think my people will agree. I have your promise that in accordance with the conditions ... - The women are going with you, for property I cannot guarantee. We'll be in Hostau in the next 48 hours. It is wise to act quickly . The Russians are not far away. Captain Danhoff, do you have horses in Hostau? - Yes. Our treasure. Perhaps the best collection in history. We are interested. - I'll see you in Hostau. Good night, Captain. Major Hoffman, will you call Captain Lauren and Lieutenant Powell? Yes sir. - Operation Cowboy will begin at 5 p.m. Shoot! They knew we were coming! Let the F-Group move on. Let the e-group split up and move to the hips. German forces are concentrated on that ridge. Go under them and run over them! It looks harmless enough. - Unless there's something in those buildings. I wonder how that SS unit found out we were going to cross the border. They found out. We will continue, but with caution and ready weapons. By agreement, Commander Danhoff hands over the weapons and the army. We are your prisoners, Colonel. That agreement will be faithfully honored by me. I will interrogate the base and the prisoners. - Lieutenant, take the lead. Captain Loyd, you are in charge. They met us at the border this morning. - I know. The officer from here predicted on ?? agreement and went to inform the SS. His actions were disrespectful. - We'll look for those responsible later. I'm sure you'll be honest. - Honest and careful. May I suggest you return as soon as possible across the border. The SS will surely reorganize. The last report is about the Russians. We have no plans to be on vacation here. How many are there? - About 1000. 600 Corsican, 100 best Arab in Europe and over 100 Lipizzaners. We are interested in Lipizzaners. - You mean take them with you? - Yes. I can help you sort them out, but it will take time. That you asked for me last night, but you didn't want to ask for favors. - Not last night. Major, are you from a part of Texas where else? can they ride - Yes. What do you say we collect them? - Sir? - Great collection. We don't have time to choose the ones we want, why don't we take them all? Yes, sir. - You're in charge. Colonel, I know these horses. They can be helpful to the US military. Even in Austria. - Captain Danhoff, I suggest you help. Then we will discuss your future. Sir, this is a war story we can tell our grandchildren. Yes, then behind our backs they tell us to tell fairy tales. Cowboys, this is school. Cowboys, this is school. Reception. Cowboys, this is school. Cowboys, this is school. Reception. Why don't we hear anything? - Be patient, Otto. Reminds ?? me to someone. - They had problems at the border. Maybe there were problems in Hostau as well. I hear you, Cowboys, reception. Received. Done. Tell the stallions to wait calmly . The girls are on their way. When will we reach the border? Are we close? - We arrived. Safe? Where are my horses? Is that what you are looking for? You don't think they mated Lipizzaner mares with other horses, do you? This has been a long war. Major. - Hello, Colonel. Colonel Reed, Colonel Podhajsky. I know your name very well. - Thank you sir. My brother rode Podhajski's horse. The captain of the Olympic team was so impressed in 1936 with your riding that he named one after you. - I'm married. My brother won several competitions with him. Here are your horses. Uz jo ?? some in addition. Colonel, shall we get a job? Is there any news? - Not since last night. We don't even know if they reached the border. - I can't get anyone. Do you want nougat? I got a box from America. - Thank you. He got up, but he's the best I've ever tasted. Stallions, stallions, it's time! - What? What is it? Slow down a little. Slow down! What are you trying to do? to say? - Stallions ... Mares. You're right. Are they here! Heavyweight, school here. These ?? ka category herein ?? cola. Reception. Forget about it! The stallions are telling you to wait calmly . Their girls are over the hill. Are coming! Are coming! Vedena, what kind of welcome is this in tears? - Neglect! I have tears left from the time I didn't dare cry. Now he gets them ?? on all occasions. For ten long years, the Spanish riding school was in exile. In 1955, the occupying forces left Austria. On the 220th anniversary of the riding hall the white horses performed again in Vienna. If it weren't for me, these horses wouldn't exist. I saved them. You know, I saved the Spanish riding school during the war. How did you do that, Grandpa? - It was in Linz, during the bombing. I faced death every day. Sync and translation: nebojsa66
