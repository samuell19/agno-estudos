I went out there and looked for you and I didn't see no goddamn Statue of Liberty. - What do you mean, man? I just stood by the road in this smelly ass shit for two hours. - What intersection did you stand by? - The one you told me to. - Which one did I tell you? - I don't know what you said, I just went around the corner and stood there. - Jesus, did you at least do the pose? - What pose? - The torchlight pose. - Yeah, I had my arm up in the air like this. - I wanted the scintillating light of Lady Liberty glistening down upon the roadside.

They wouldn't pay me, 'cause they said they ran out of money. Do you think I could get like five bucks? - Hm. - I just need five bucks, that's it, take your hand off your dick and give me the money. That's two bucks, fucker. Yah! - Get off me! - I don't wanna see that shit right now. - Yeah, you do. What up with Cody's face paint, yo?

And shit, I think there's something wrong with him. I mean, look at him, doesn't he look weird to you? - Man, babies can't get sick, fucking chill, all right. - They can't? - No. - Face paint ain't gonna fuck him up. FaceFuka never takes his paint off, 'cause it protects you from AIDS. - Yeah, but as soon as you put that shit on his face, he started acting like super retarded. - He probably got pissed off, 'cause you took his FaceFuka paint off, I don't know. - No, I Doogled it.

Move out of my fucking way! - No one wants you here. Janee just told me two seconds ago not to let you in. - Shut the fuck up. Where is she? - Getting dressed, chill. - Actually, I wanna talk to you too. - Fuck off, what? - My Mom caught my little brother smoking chenko yesterday, you piece of shit. I know it was you who sold it to him. - I don't sell anything. Why would it be me? - Exactly, he doesn't know any dealers. Where else is he gonna get it from? - Leave me the fuck alone. I don't even smoke chenko. - I'm telling you, that paint's gonna give him hardcore ear problems today. He's gonna grow up mega retarded like Jordan. - I don't know, I mean, his ears seemed fine. - Babies are like little microwaves inside. They'll just keep heating up until they pop. - Oh my God, really? - Yeah. - You gotta buy it for him ASAP or his appendix is gonna melt. If you don't get him some today, he's gonna be fucked. - Yeah, well, - I asked Jordan for some money to get some. - Yeah, what'd he say? - Hm? What's up, girl? - Hey Jordan, send me a picture of your dick, and I'll show you my asshole. - You know what, I? - Jordan! - What, Dad? - Where's my pills?

You can't dunk on dijo. He's twelve feet tall! - Harvey. Somebody's here for you, Harvey. - Excuse me, guys, I have to go, yell at my grandma. - Harvey, Harvey. - What, Grandma? What do you want? - Who is this here, Harvey? Who is this here? - Hold on, everybody. The rest of my wings are here. - Here you go, two family-size orders of South Korean style, extra buffalo, buffalo wings. All right? - Eat me, Donut. Buffalo wings are good for you, Donut. Eat me. - Please. Don't leave. - Um, Jordan, uh, while you're at home watching Cody today, you know, don't go nowhere, and please don't make any fuckin' deals at the house. - Oh my God, you're seriously gonna trust this fucked up mongreed piece of shit with a life of another human being for more than 13 seconds? - He'll be fine. - Just make sure you fuckin' feed him. - Fuck off, fat bitch. Can't take this out of your cunty voice. - Are they still letting you skip third period? - Oh my God. They never give me a hard time now when I come in late for class. Like I'll just tell the receptionist, I have a hardcore pink taco, and she'll pretty much write me a pass for whatever. - Oh, uh, well, do you think you could stop by the house on your way home, and just, you know, check up on Jordan? - It's seriously so sad that you have to ask me that. If I knew who my kid's dad was and he was around, I would never let him be this dumb. - Okay, calm your tits. Jane√©, I fucking love you, but he makes you stupider, and you can't trust him not to fuck things up. - I trust him. - Did you tell him about those hair-cutting classes you want to take? - Freaking, chill, leave me alone. I'm gonna tell him about Angela's, duh. Look, I'm gonna be late. Please just promise me that you'll check up on him. - Oh, I'll be here. I can't even imagine what that fucker's up to while you're gone. - Thank you. - Oh, Murphy. - I don't really understand why you understand, what you meant there in that text. What the fuck does B-A-F-L mean? - Bring a fucking lot. I thought you'd know that one. - Nope. - Look, um, I don't know if you're gonna be cool with this, but fucking, I was like, he'd pissed if I didn't ask, right. - What? Dude, you mind turning this down, man? This is fucking annoying. - Nah, I lost the remote, dope. - You mind fucking changing the channel or something? This is fucking ridiculous. - Nah, the channel buttons on the TV are broke, too. - So, by a fucking lot, you mean a full or a half sleeve? - Give me a full one. - And John says taking it to the corner, and oh, stolen by Dijo. Not in my house. Personally, I think they should just retire this sport, because there's nobody here that's ever going to be better at basketball than Dijo, ever. - Do you ever think Dijo thinks about me? - I don't know, but I know Dijo thinks about me. - No way. I'm like the biggest Dijo fan ever. - Second biggest. I'm the biggest Dijo fan ever. - No, but you don't understand. I live in a wonderful world. Dijo. - Not in my house. - Here you go. You got the money? - Um, see, well, that's the thing. Uh, right now, little low on funds. - Why'd you tell me to bring all this shit over? - I got you. I'll have those really tonight, but if you can't wait. I can do something else right now. Check this out. I will give you $17.14 in quarters, nickels, and dimes. Two one-dollar bills, a pack of gum, Tornado Hackers on DVD, this filter for a humidifier that I found in my dad's closet, some balloons, and one bottle of Brogenix testosterone supplement, practically unused. Yo, that Brogenix alone is worth like 12 payments of $19.95. So whatever that adds up to, you is getting it. - Jordan, Jordan! Who you talking to? - I'm not talking to anyone, Dad. - Your nose is bleeding. - What? - Yo, I thought you were gonna have some cash. - Nah, man, I'm gonna borrow to get some cash. Man, you don't want to take that stuff right there. It's fine. I'll have your money for you later tonight, 100% guaranteed. You know, I do a little pushin' on the side myself. All I got to do is sell a couple seed bags. Yo, my people front me shit all the time. Don't worry. - Jordan, Jordan! Are you talking about me? - What, Dad? I'm talking to a fucking friend. - Jordan, Jordan, Jordan! - I just need to see your dick again. Come on, Jordan, send me some. Send me some pictures, please? Come on, send me some pictures, please? - Is that a fucking baby? - Everything's cool, fucking chill. Y'all, man, you ain't gotta worry about that motherfucker. He's always like. It's like, yeah, my dad just took a lot of acid, that's all. - What, right now? - No, like 20 years ago. He was homeless for a while, then he joined the army. Then he got really into acid. It's just how he is. It's best not to piss him off. He will literally try to kill you. - All right, I'm gonna call you at eight o'clock. I'm taking this shit, but I still want that money. No excuses. Fucking loser. - Great. - Jordan, Jordan! - I've explained it to you four times already. I don't know how much more simple to make this. Listen, all we need is baby's DOB, and then I can set up the appointment for you, but you can't just walk in here. - I don't, I don't know what the fuck that is. - Get off the phone, Jane√©. - Fuck, he's back. - Jane√©, listen. Maureen's 12:30 doesn't want any Angela products in her hair. So look, I put some dish detergent in a bottle. Just use that, she'll never know the difference, okay? - Daphne, listen. I'm so, so, so sorry, but I can't make the last payment for Angela's Superstar program. - What? - Oh, no, no, no. You can't do that. - Cody's appendix is gonna melt, and like, it's super retarded. Like I called all these baby-ologists, and they're all like, nah, we won't take him without stupid fucking money. - Do you have any idea how this is gonna make Angela feel? Angela has feelings, Jane√©. - Dude, come on. Look, that guy's come back again, creepin' on. - Eh, he throws me five bucks just to sit there, and I don't see a thing wrong with it. Go deal with the clients. - No, that's the thing. You got the cash for that, man? Dude, I gotta make a run. - Nah, I'll have to get you later with the cash. - Fuck man. I haven't even sampled that shit yet. - It's not that great. - Yo, well. I'll let you have it, if you do me a favor. - What is it? - Just watch my baby for like five minutes. - Aw, man, I gotta smoke chenko and play video games. I can't help you. - Fuck your video games then. Get up out of here, man, vamos. What's that smell? - Yo, dude. - Man, where are you? You said you would be here an hour ago. - I know, fucking chill. - Wah-wah-wah-wah, wha-wah-wah. Get over here, now. - All right, fucking chill. I'm leaving right now. I'll be right there. - Yeah, sure. - Fuck. If everyone just let me get high for two seconds. I don't have time for this. I gotta go. Dad, I need you to watch the baby. - Baby, what baby? - You never noticed that a baby lives in your fucking house before? - Don't fucking curse at me. - Listen, Dad, just stand there, and look at the fucking thing. I'll be back in five minutes. - God dammit. - Brandenburg Dental, this is Rane√© speaking. How can I help you? - Dude, it's me. - Jane√©, where the fuck are you right now? Mom is so fucking pissed. I know that you killed that baby, didn't you? - No, shut up. I know what I'm doing. I told you I'm not gonna kill him. Dude, this was a bad idea. - Bad idea, yeah, just like your life was a bad idea. - Excuse ma'am. - Excuse me, I need to tell this bitch off. Fuck you. I am the motherfucking Napoleon of making genius babies. I know what happened. I can see it now. Cody's in a dumpster. You don't even have to apologize. - No, Cody's not sick or dying or anything like that. He's doing super fucking awesome. Thank you for asking, bitch. - Right. You know, Michelangelo doesn't have time to get sick. He wouldn't do that to us. - Well good for Michelangelo. - I have a big boy job that I need to get back to. Why the fuck are you calling me? - I need money. - No. - Dude, come on. I can't have all this. Angela's, come on, you know how much this means to me. - How the fuck did you do that? No, not, still no, not even considering it, and don't ask Mom, either. She hates you forever, goodbye. - Please, come on, I'll pay you back. Look, I lied. Cody's super sick, okay? It sucks. I got a job with Angela, and this is my shot. I don't know what I'm gonna do. - That's sad, Jane√©. - Oh my, fucking bitch. - Yo, Jordan. - Yo, what it do? Got here as fast as I could. You still gonna be able to do this? - Did you finally get that money. - Yes, I did. - Hold on one second. I don't know where you got this from, but it's not enough. - Shit, man, you sure? I thought that was a lot of cash. - Oh, there is, but it's mostly ones. - What about that discount I was getting? - Even with your friend discount, this will cover you about a sixth, at most. - Okay, well would you maybe do it in installments, like a sixth now, and then you know, we could do the rest later on? - I don't see why not. All right, so this where you wanted that turkey. - Yeah, like blam, all about the size of my left shoulder there. - Okay. And you're sure this is the design you want to do? You don't want to go with the spider, with big tits, right, a skull, motorcycle. - Spiders are badass, but I'm gonna have to stick with the baby picture. Tryin' to win a shitload of chenko from FaceFuka's baby tattoo contest. You know what I'm talkin' about? Hey, you want to see some pregnant titties? - Jordan, are you filming me? - No, bitch. Givin' me shit, man. He don't love the baby. He never do nothing for it. I'm like, shit. I'll show you how much I love that baby, fucking bitch. Get his face burned into my shoulder. What you goin' to do about that? - Okay, so you doin' all this, just to prove to her that you're right, and she's wrong, even though she is probably kind of right. - No. Man, I know that thing's annoying and expensive as fuck, but I'm like, fine. I'll let it stick around as long as you just fucking chill. - I don't know what you guys are fighting about, but you don't want to keep a baby. You don't got to keep a baby. - What do you mean? - Well, there's ways. There's people you can call, people who might be interested in helping you out with those kind of problems. - Wait. For real? - Mm-hmm. - It's Dijo time. It's Donut time. Dijo time. Donut time. Donut time. - Dad? - I feel sick. - Look what you did. I ain't cleaning that up.

Don't play games with me, you hamburger. We know it was you who stole from us. I'm coming by your house - Fuck you. - tonight for that money. You hand it over. I swear I won't tell your dad or anyone else what happened. THat's a fair offer. - How 'bout you give me that other five bucks you screwed me on this morning, and I won't tell everybody how much of an old doucher you are. - Don't worry about that chenko later. I'm good. - But Dee, come on. I need that money. My baby's all sick, he's like... - Okay, that's really cute. You should probably talk to Bundy over there. He's really not so bad, takes like 30 seconds. Helps me pay my rent. - I don't think you realize what is coming down on you, if you don't surrender it now. - Whatever, I gotta go. Oh, what's up, dude. Yo, I was gonna call you. I'm sorry that I... - That's not gonna work. Where's my money? - Um, well, that's the thing. - See, you don't have it, do you? - Technically, no, I don't. - And you're not gonna pay me, either, today, are you? - Probably not. - Where's my fucking chenko? - Hey, where you going? Hey, hey. Get out of here, hey. Don't touch that. - I don't like to be fucked with. Where is it? - I kind of lost it, yo. - Oh really, you wanna revise your answer? - I told you, I fucking lost it.

That's my dad's anti-acid flashback medicine. There's so much acid still in his spine if he doesn't take it, he gets really bad trips, like all day long. Seriously, you can have anything else but that. Come on, man. There's other valuable shit in here you could take. - What the fuck? - Uh, dude, are you okay? - Whoa, excuse me, buddy.

He is not safe with you here. - What are you doing? Isn't that like baby-napping or something? - Call the cops. - I don't give a fuck. - Fine, you need a fucking baby. I didn't realize you teach all day long. Whoa, you can't take my baby. You fat bitch, I already fucking got you pregnant and gave you a baby. I wanted to keep that one. Hey. What the fuck it. - Tell her she's got the salami. I'm not talking to her again. - I thought we had a good thing going here, Jordan.

We're gonna get so fucking high, man. - Man, you look fine. - I know. - God. - It smells like tree bark. - Who the fuck is calling me? - Yo, give me a hit. - Who the fuck you are? I'll fix up my own bong. - Jane√©, you better thank me. I just got off the phone with that cuntoid, Angela, and you know what she just said to me? What is it with you and the phone? Can't anyone around here stop the texting for two seconds? - Nah, I better stick it up my asshole. Work way faster. - As long I've been sending - girls to Angela's Superstar School, I've never seen them make any exceptions for anybody, ever. - Whoa, you can't take off bump-bump while I'm driving. - It's cool, yo.

What do you want? - I'm gonna eat so much food, and then I'm gonna shit so much. I wonder what we should get. We should split some Scuzzers. - I ain't got no money. - Shit, I ain't buying you nothing, you bitch. - He's gonna die.

He's moving at Brontosaurus speed. - Dijo, my man. Holy shit, what the fuck happened, Jordan? Were you trying to steal my chenko? - Uh, no. - On behalf of child services, I'd like to thank you for reporting the baby found in the dumpster earlier. We take dumpster babies very seriously here at child services. We're gonna go ahead and launch a full investigation, okay? - Amazing. - Do you have any idea where the mother might be located? - Um, yeah. I've got that for you right here. - Roger, Jengo 17, we got some potential shit bags on bicycles in the woods on Chester.

Don't fucking move, shot. - Choner, we got reports of gunshots fired in your vicinity. Please respond. - 17, yeah I just got attacked by a group of boys high on chenko. - Are you in danger? - Yes, I'm fearing for my life right now. Oh, shit. You're gonna tell me exactly where you got this fucking chenko from, or else I'm gonna stick so many things up your fucking ass, you're gonna bleeding for a month. I have every size nightstick in the trunk of my police car. Some are black, some are white, some are even Asian, which you might even enjoy. Let me tell you something. You are not gonna enjoy when I put the black one in. - Dude, don't I have the right remain silent? - What? No. - Okay. - Uh, well. - Told you, it's not my fault, man. Couldn't find a tissue or nothing in your car. You need to keep some napkins around. Besides, what's the big deal? You told me it only cost five bucks. - Doesn't mean I want you to get nosebleed city on my shit. - Man, I'll clean it up, I promise. - Well, then go do it then, you bloody nose havin' bitch. - Let's just go get high first, then I'll wipe down all the blood and vacuum the whole thing. Come on, please. Just let me do one hit, Donut. - Jordan, do you know where the pills are? - No, Dad, I didn't open anything. - Oh, there you are. Jordan, have you seen my pills? I can't find them. - No, Dad, I don't know who took your pills. - They were right here, and they're gone again. Jordan, remember where I put them. - I don't know, did you look in the bathroom? - Bathroom? I don't put my pills in the bathroom. - You got five minutes. - Five minutes til what? - Five minute to pay us back, or we'll tell your dad, and we'll all whoop you good. - Man, I give you five minutes to get the fuck out my face. I ain't stole shit. - Jordan, Jordan, get in here. Where else can I look? - I'm not screwing around here, you lizard. You first Peruvian war vet right here. I can smell the lies on your breath. - Fucking asshole. - Hey! - What are you doing home? Ain't you supposed to be working overtime? - Jordan, I don't have my pills. You gotta help me find them. - I don't know, Dad. I cannot look right now. - I came home as soon as Stephanie told me what you did. This is the worst possible fucking thing you could've done, Jordan. - Who the fuck. - Don't be so loud. - Just fucking chill, okay? - No, I'm done chilling. I'm done fucking chilling. - I need my pill now. - Whatever Stephanie said she saw was a total. I didn't try to sell anything. She's wrong, I swear, I wouldn't do that. - Time's up, Jordan. Is there something you want to tell your dad? - What, no, man. - Jordan,. - That's the guy. That's him right there. - I just caught this kid smoking chenko in the middle of the woods. He said it was you who sold it to him. Is that true? - No, Officer. - I don't know who this little fucking doucher is. - Are you sure it's this fucking dickhole? - Yeah. - Put your hands up against the wall. Come on, turn around. I coulda just smelled the chenko on you. We'll go wrist deep in your fucking ass. - No, Dad, no one's here, man. I didn't sell shit to them little kids, man. Whatever they told you is not fucking true, all right? - Somehow, you're clean, which is a miracle, just looking at your dirty ass, but now I gotta search the premises. - Oh, come on, Jordan, you never plugged up this thing. - What is this? - Uh, yeah, that's uh, one of those things, uh, what you call? - Chenko pipe? - Nah, that's not it. - I don't even know what to think. You have more chenko memorabilia than I have ever seen in my entire life. Yet you say no to drugs. You got some fucking balls. - There's something I need to tell you. - Fuck, mother fuck, bitch. - Ah, help me,. - Hey, you know how dangerous a drug like chenko is? I'll tell you. I've seen it myself. It puts holes in your dick. - Oh my God, I'm stuck. - Stop. - Who's here? I don't see anybody. - Hold on, I'll be right back. I'm not goin' far. Just stay here for him. - Don't leave me with him. - I don't wanna hear you try to pull some shit to get back at that kid, either. You understand me? - Yeah, is that it? - Excuse me, Officer, but there's something I need to discuss with you. - No, there isn't. Shut the fuck up, Walter. - What is it? - I'm a have to, kid. - You didn't give me a chance. - This man. Committed a crime. - Jesus Christ, what now? - Would you help me? - Who the hell are you? - Help me. - Donut. - Fuck, that's assault on an officer. You're under arrest, you fucking fat fuck. What happened to you, raisin man? Did he do that to you? Okay, that's double aggravated assault. You're under arrest, you fat fuck. Get up. Come on, you fucking cannibal, let's go. Come on, you fucking fat piece of shit. - Wait, Officer, I wanted to tell you something. - Look, come down to the station if you want to file a report. I gotta take care of this knuckle, hey, hey, come on! - You don't know what this kid did to me. - Let's go, close the door. - You don't know how bad he is. - See you later, Jordan, I gotta go. - Donut. - What? - Can I eat your wings? - No. - But Officer, we use that money to buy wounded vets prosthetic limbs. - Look, I told you, I don't give a shit. Hey. Where you going? - Uh, uh, uh. - What the fuck is this? - He got a nosebleed. Don't take my car, please. Jordan, Jordan, please. Jordan, Jordan, please. - I gotta run these plates. - Oh come on, I just... - Shut the fuck up, don't move. - Jordan! - Whatever. Why the fuck are you such a shitty fucking nose? - Jordan, I'm comin' over right now. My vagina's on fire, and you gotta help me put it out. I'm comin' right now, Jordan, right now. - You're such an asshole. - What? What'd I do? - You know you fucking did. - Oh the baby thing? Come on. You're gonna believe Stephanie? She got it all wrong. He asked me to sell it, and I was like no, no way, not in a million years, man. That's my baby boy. - Really? You didn't try to sell him? - No. I would never do that, come on. - But give it, why was there even a guy here? You were supposed to be watching Cody, not fucking with your friend. - I know, I wasn't gonna say anything, but he was only here cause he was trying to sell me some off the market baby medicine. They got this dope shit that the government won't let you have, curing babies left and right of all kinds of fucked-up diseases only you don't hear about it because it's super underground, man. - Really? Well, I don't know about that. Did you get some? - No, yeah, he actually came and tried to rob me, but all he got off with was the microwave. - Seriously, Jordan, you didn't need to do that. - Well, hey. That's my baby boy. I'll risk myself like that for him. Look, I was gonna try and surprise you, but I might as well show you now. You think I don't love that baby? Check this out. I'm getting his fucking face tattooed on my fucking back. - Shit, Jordan. How much did you spend on that? Don't you think we coulda put that money towards something a little better? - No, what's a better way to show you how much I love my baby boy, and how wrong you were that I didn't. There isn't one. - Okay, I didn't tell you, but Daphne got me into Angela's Haircut Superstar classes. If you do this, you get all certified to cut people's hair, and I think it would be really good for us, you know, to help pay for Cody? Hairstylists make mad loot. - Oh. - Yeah. I really only needed a little bit more money to get in, so, maybe you could go back to your tattoo guy and tell him you don't want the rest of it, and we could put that money towards something else, like me, myself, and my haircut classes. - All right. I'll do it. - Fucking Jordan, why can't you just not fuck up for once? - Man, how'd I fuck up? I already explained to you what happened? It's not my fault Stephanie came and stole our baby. - Oh my, oh yeah, we, we gotta go over there and get him back. I don't want Cody to forget my face. I mean, how are you gonna sell a baby? That's so ridiculous. You couldn't do that. - You mean, you never heard of that shit? For fresh white babies, shit. I hear you can pull in like five, ten K at least. - Yeah, but who would do that? - Well, if you think about it, it's not really that bad of an idea. I mean, you could take them haircut classes you been talking about, and I could finish up my tattoo, maybe get a few more killer ones, like spiders, shit, with that type of money, you could be covered with spiders. - Yeah, but 10K would never begin to make up for Cody. - Yeah, yeah, you're right. Maybe we should ask for more. - What? - Nothing, I mean, if you ever decided, you know, that you didn't want him anymore, I do know a guy. - Did you seriously just say what I thought you just said? - Maybe. - I cannot believe you've been lying to me. This entire time, Stephanie was telling me the truth, and you made me think my best friend was lying to me? What the hell, what's that? - Jordan! I got your chenko. Ooh, look at you. You just as cute as your pictures. Ooh, look. I got your chain. - Who the fuck are you, bitch? I will slice your tits off. - Look, ain't he so beautiful? - Those were super special to me. How could you send those to her, Jordan? - Man, it was an accident. We talked about this. I do that sometimes when I'm really fucking high. - You can't say that when you're always fucking high. - I'm not high right now. I don't even have any chenko. I've been looking for it all fucking day. - I'll give you all the chenko you want. I'll give you all the chenko you want. Please. - Hey, don't take my dick out. - Just take your dick out, - That's not your dick. - Please, Jordan. - That's my dick. - Hey, wait a minute. What's going on? - If you want to get fucked up with your chick horse, go right a-fucking-head, I won't stop you. Oh, fuck you. - Give me that dick. - Please, please. I'll pull my dick out. I'll stick it anything you want, please. All I want is one hit of chenko, please. Just one chenko hit, please. Just a little chenko. - Really? - Fuck you, Donut. - Man, this is bullshit city, man. Dude, fuck. - Here, sniff this off my titty. Wait, no you can't, don't touch it. You gotta sniff it up my ass first. Sike. - Aw, fuck you, bitch. Give me a hit. - Oh, Jordan, oh, Jordan, it burns. I'm burning up. I don't know why it's doing this, Jordan. Just make right, top it, eat up. It's time to eat these green peas that grandmama made. Eat it up, eat 'em up, Jordan. Clean it up. Eat up, Jordan. Eat up What the fuck? Oh what the fuck is? What the fuck? - What the fuck is that? - Make it stop. A damn baby popped out. - Get away from me. I don't want nothing to do with them slime people. - Baby. Yo Dude... I think I got something you might want. Where's the product? - Right over here, yo. Gettin' a good deal. This is a fresh fucking baby, brah. - Whoa, dude. What the fuck? That ain't your kid! Fuck, man! I don't even give a fuck. Just give me some chenko, and the whole thing is yours, man. Please, that's all I want. - Nah, I don't have any chenko, man. I just deal, brah, okay? But I can probably get you some scorpions if you wanted to grow your own. - No, man, I want to get high right fucking now. I'm sick of all this fucking hairstylers, fucking biker gang baby in my face bullshit, man. What can we do here, bro? Yo, I gotta get rid of this thing. You gotta sell some fucking babies. I gotta stick some fucking chenko up my ass. Let's work something out here, bro, please. - I don't know, man. I mean, nah, there's nothing I can do, man. - Dude, you don't want this thing? Fine, I'll go set him free in the parking lot of fucking Badingos. I don't give a shit, man. There's gotta be something we can do. - All right, all right. Calm down, dude. Do you a favor since I'm such a nice guy. Give you a Zitcoin for it. - Rad. So I can use that to buy some chenko, right? - Yeah, that should be easy. - Hit me up. - There you go. You got one Zitcoin, brah. - Cody, oh my God, Cody, are you dead? Oh Cody. - Oh Jane√©, I thought you were gonna be a superstar at Angela's. What happened to that plan, huh? Didn't pan out, did it? - What is she doing here? - You don't understand. She doesn't mean fresh of you, Jane√©. - I called mom. She is so pissed that you tried to sell your baby. She is on her way now to kick your ass for being such a disappointment. She hates you now more than she ever did before. - Why did you call Mom? I can't deal with Mom right now. I can handle the issue on my own. - Oh you can, yeah. You are homeless. Your baby is on the verge of death. Your mom is on the way to send your boyfriend off to the joozy-house. But you're on top of this? You know, when Michelangelo was Cody's age, Marlo taught me to read four books. - No, five books. - Five books. I guess I don't blame Cody, though. It's not his fault his brain is probably fried from chenko smoke and not feeding him baby medicine when he is sick. - Dude, I got him baby medicine. It's right here in my purse, you fucking bitchwad. It is right here. I got it for him. Dude, where is it? - I don't know. - Like it was in here. I don't know, oh my God, no, no, no, no. I swear to God, oh God, it was in my purse. It was in my purse. - I put it in here. - I know, I know, I know. - 100% whale testosterone used in ancient Japanese warrior blends for hundreds of years. He used to be a fat curd. - I gotta find that remote. - Start taking Brogenix. Now for the past year, I've gotten two children, and I'm already working on my third. On hot chicks, all day long. - Awesome. - Oh dear, you okay there, buddy? Can you hear me? - Nah, what do you want? - Well, this is Tazel from Brogenix again. Last time we spoke, you were telling me your dad's card got stolen. If you give me the number on the card, I can send you that refund, and we can- - Yeah, hold on a second. I want to get that for you. What the fuck, you stop, stop calling here. My dad's credit card is stolen. I don't care for to pay the phone bill neither. - Jordan, what happened? My credit card got stolen? - No, Dad. - I didn't know I had a credit card. Why didn't you tell me? - You don't have a credit card, Dad. I was just saying that to get this girl off my ass. I didn't get you a credit card. It ain't stolen. Everything is fine. - I gotta get out of here, Jordan. He won't let me go. - Man, you probably gotta pay bail or some shit like that> - I got money. You have to get me out of here. I can't take it any more. - All right, fucking chill. Where is it, I'll bring it to you. - It's under my desk. Bring it all, I don't care. And Jordan, please, you have to tell them. I didn't do anything. They won't let me. - Okay, I get the point, fuck. - Jane√©, let's go, come on. I am gonna settle this right now. - Hey, but Mom, did you hear? - Let's go. - Cody is like in mega meltdown mode. - Let's go. - He could be dying. We need to get him appendix drops or Baby aspirin first. - Like that'll help. You poisoned him with face paint! You really think he's just gonna get over it with some pink baby goop? - Yes, because the internet said it. So it must be true. - Oh, so you to have to read the internet to learn how to be a bad mom. - Where you hustling off to, Jordan? Come here, front and center. I want to talk to you. - Too bad I got nothing to talk about. What the fuck was that? - Now where would this reptile be slithering off to at this time of night? I'm gonna take a wild guess and say he's going out to buy something. - How 'bout it's none of your fucking business where I go? Why don't you back off before I do something? - What you gonna do, touch screen? Poke me? Look at you, you ain't a real man. I wouldn't trust you to tie my shoes, let alone occupy a goddamn country. You know what I was doing when I was your age? - I don't know, fucking your cat? - No, I was in the jungles of Peru, making sure my brothers didn't die every single day. - Oh, is that how you became such a prick? - That's why I say we need to have one or two more wars on just to recycle fuckups like you on something worth a damn. - Look at this. Is this it? - Oh, what a coincidence. Didn't we have a wad of cash just about that thick ripped off from us today? - We sure as cat did. - That's an awful lot of money to be carrying around while you're high. - Give it back. I'm not fucking high. - He's going right now to the dealer's to buy some illegal drugs with it. - Doesn't make any sense at all. Seriously, that's not even my money. You gotta give it back. - Oh really? Not yours, I never would've guessed that. - No, it's my Dad's, I swear. I was going over to bail him out right now. Hey, you can't come and take it from me like that. Man, it's his money you're stealing from me, not mine. - You're a terrible liar, Jordan. - Hey, stop the car. Man. I should charge you after I bail my dad out. Bastard. - Whoa, you can't smoke in here. Put that shit out. Come on, smoking. Get the tape, are we taping? - Yo, I said I'm putting it out. - Come on, smoking. - Jordan, oh, thank God you're here. They're making a movie about me, and the police are in on it. They let the cameras into my cell. And, and then, look, behind you. They're back. - He seriously needs his medicine to shut him up. We don't have any cameras in here. - Jordan, did you find my money? It's my only way out of this shithole. - I did, but on my way over, I kinda lost it, so at the moment, I don't actually have your money. - Oh, wait, hold on here. You don't have the money? You can't have him, if you don't have the money. That's what fucking bail is. - Come on, man, can't you just let him out? I had it like ten minutes ago, for real. - You used it to go buy drugs, didn't you? - All right, all right, all right. - You're so fucked now, - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - I'll kill you for this. - Hold on, hold on. - I know that smell. It smells like you've been smoking fucking baby aspirin. Did you seriously just walk into a police station high as fuck? Hey, baby drop-off is in the back. - Is that Jane√©'s mom? - Hey, hey, hey. Where the fuck is he going? Boys, get him, boys! Get him, get him! Get him, Choner. Jordan! - Jengo, we got a bogey on the loose. Bogey on the loose. Fucker. - Donut. Open the fuck up, come on. - Aw yeah, buffalo wings. Ho, ho, ho. There's hook-up city up in here. Look at that, look at that. DOHOG78. - Harvey, Harvey, it sounds like somebody's smoking down there. - Please, can, I've been waiting all fucking day, Donut. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean like, as soon as my Grandma goes to sleep, like my guy will be here soon. - Harvey, are you smoking? - No, Grandma, I don't smoke. - Should I put this out? - No, no, it's fine. - So what time's that Zitcoin guy gettin' here? - Mm, just like in five minutes. - Awesome, maybe I can get his info. I need a new chenko guy. - Harvey, it still smells like smoke. What you doing in there? - Nothing, Grandma. I'm just eating buffalo wings. - Man, you ain't even eatin' all the chicken off of that. Look at all that meat left. - You want it? Eat it. I don't like putting my tongue in that far. - Hi, Grandma Donut. - Hello, Jordan. I didn't know you were here. - Hell yeah, bitch, fucking ball. - Harvey, you know you're not supposed to be smoking down here. Tobacco smoke makes my e coli flare up? - Why aren't you asleep right now? - I will be in bed in ten minutes. Sweetheart, please, don't smoke. - Yo, put that down. I wasn't even done with that one yet. - I'm sorry, chill. Whoa, oh man. Don't touch my wings. - Yo, man, I don't have a half hour to wait for you to shower after you shit. Murphy, what are you doing here? - Oh, don't tell me it's you. You can have your Zitcoin back because I'm not selling you a goddamn thing, you sick fuck. - Hey, I'm not the dude who hit you up. - Stay away from me. You want me to bring the force? - Hey, watch it, man. I got sauce on my fingers. - That microwave was loaded with centipedes. I junked it. - What's that noise? Did you just break something? - Oh, I think I have deja vu. What can I take in trade this time? How 'bout that power drill over there? - You can't take that. It's not mine. - Get the fuck out of my way. - Ow, ow, ow. - Shit, dude. - Fuck, what happened? - You just stabbed an old lady. - No, no, I was swinging. Oh fuck, you're right, I did. - No, Mom, it's not gonna work. Angela's doesn't operate on my logic. You can't do that. - No, no, no. No, no, no, Jane√©. You are going to get a job at the dealer. I am not going into that salon again. - Mom, please come back. Can you please help me give Cody this baby medicine? These directions don't make any sense. - Yeah, it's probably pretty hard to understand if you don't know how to read. - Why are you so mean to me? It's not my fault your life sucks just because you decided not to go to Angela's. - Are you effing seriously serious right? My life could not be more amazing right now. I am so glad I gave that shit up. Cutting hair is bimbo work, Jane√©. Do you wanna what kind of people cut hair? Goon bag morons that's who. - Maybe if you hadn't given it up, you wouldn't have a stick up so far up your ass? - Get you off the couch in about 13 minutes. - Whatever. - When whale testosterone hits your bloodstream. Remember, Japanese warriors have been taking whale testosterone for the past eight centuries. - Where the fuck - is that remote? I've seen this shit. I'm not gonna stop looking til I find this mother fucker. Oh shit, there it is. I've been looking all over for this. - Oh, hiya there. It's Tazel from Brogenix again. I want to get this payment all settled before I leave for the day. If you got your information stolen, it's important we jump on that right away. I'm not sure what happened. I think we got disconnected last time we talked. - No, we didn't get - Disconnected, I actually hung up on you. - Brogenix, scientifically proven. Jordan, fucking listen to me. Where did you say you've been? I take it, why did you give it to me? Give it to me. Give it to me. Give the damn baby to me. Jordan, are you fucking listening to me? - Give him the baby, Jordan. - God dammit. - Give that baby away. Give me the baby, you fuck. - Shit doesn't even work, man. I'm way fucking ass high. Where was that remote? I saw it. - Brogenix, genetically alters your DNA to be more like a new whale. - My phone. What the hell is this? - Yo bro, I'm good again. Hit me up if you need some. - Solliver's back. - There he is. Oh friend, hang up. - Hey, pop. - I have to took you. - Knock over my things, I've been working on that for six months. - You don't want to do this the wrong way. We'll hold him down, and you can beat him, Peruvian style. - You're lucky Walter's here. He had to come down and bail me out with his own money, you fucking son of a bitch. - He didn't pay for shit, Dad. Those fucking assholes came, and they stole all your money. I swear, I didn't lose any of it until they took it from me. - You had to go and buy drugs, didn't you? Fuck, you're high right now. That's proof. - Uh-huh, he is as high as Thursday. - What the fuck? - I told you that's what he was doing. - Fuck you all. Why do you have to be such vaginas about everything. - Fuck me? Fuck me, no, fuck you. I want you out of my house. Leave! - Calm down, you're having another flashback. Okay, I'm leaving, chill. - We got a 17. This is Delta One Nine. Can you give me a status on your location? - I need you to kill him. That the point. - Choner, right here. You can smell the fucking chenko outside. - I just paid you. Get out of my house. I don't have any more money to give you. - Oh, so you haven't learned your lesson the first time, huh? - Please, don't arrest him again. - Get off of him. You can't do this. He needs his medication. - I don't have any more money to give you. Get off of me. You can't take me back there. I'll kill all of you. - Oh, you gonna make threats now? - Dad, I can't take this shit. I can't take this shit no more. Man, I need chenko so bad. My scorpion chain. I broke my fucking scorpion chain. Why, scorpion gods? Why have you forsaken me? I need chenko. My hat? Where the fuck this come from? - This fucking asshole. - Suck my fucking dick, yo. - What you doing man? - That my hat. Yo, yo, hold up, motherfuckers. Got any chenko?

C'mon, you fucking broke. Yo, you got to be high as fuck. What you on? Yo, bro, you are the highest person I've ever fucking seen. Good for you, man. How did you get there? - Shit bag, chenko feind Fuck hole, I knew it. Jengo 17, the bogey's been spotted. And He's fucking dead. - I need some chenko, bro. You know where I can find any? - You're just a baby? But I hate you. - Chenko, do you have any? Whoa, watch, yo. - Hey, you got a fucking ticket? - You got a baby, go ahead. Hey, that ain't no baby. What's this fuck baby, yo. - I'm entering my baby's face. I'm gonna go let that little motherfucker right now. - Are you sure you want to let me do this? I don't know, dude. I don't want to fuck up your hair. - Jane√©, you can totally cut it all off. Give me a mohawk, if you need to. I just want you to be the best haircutter of all haircutter history. - I fucking love you face Fuka. - I need some chen-chen right now, bitch. Give me this shit. - That's my ball. - What the fuck is this? This is not drugs, little girl. This is not drugs, little girl's mom. Why would you not bring drugs to a concert. - Maybe I can like dye it a sort of color that can like match your skin. - What are you doing with those fucking scissors? - Don't fucking move. - Okay, fucking chill, man, chill. - Did you really think I was gonna let you get chenko today? I shouldn't even be here right now. It's 11:00.

She has too many things to do in the afternoon, and nobody wants to look after that little shit ball while you're prancing around in Angela land. - I told her if I could stop one of you shit bag fucks, for gettin' high on dope, I don't need to fuck my fat wife, when I can just fuck you. - No, Angela's is not negotiable.

Why can't you help me out? - Nobody wants you to touch their hair, please. I'd rather pay for a can full of bees to sting me in the face over and over and over again than to pay for you to go to that shit. - Why can't you just chill, dude. I'm not fucking with you, bro. There's a Billion people out there doing the same shit. All we wanna do is get fucking high and just chill. That's it. You can't arrest all of us. - Yes, I can. - I'm a good person. I got good inside me that you know nothing about, but I'm not gonna be anything like you. I'm gonna be somebody. Angela's gonna turn me into more of a somebody than you will ever be. - You really think they're gonna let in a girl who has a streak that looks like the inside of my asshole? - Chenko makes your life fucking retarded. Now don't move, and let me un-retard your fucking retarded life. - You goon-bag nasty bitch. - No, man. Without chenko, there is no life. - You do not pull that shit with me. Comb your fucking hair, bitch. - Dijo chop, son. - It's over, Jordan. Don't fight it.
