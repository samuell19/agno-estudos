"It' going to be a hard drive, but if we all hold together, we'll make it. and I'm asking you to be cheerful and to think of each other."

" "I still believing about the accident, but why did you lie about him afterwards?" "Because my brother wanted me, to say what I did. " "Tell me again how it happened, and tell it slow!" Gambling for their next day's water allowance. Unalterably convinced that his brother was murdered by one of the two men. "I'm leaving tonight with two men. Maybe we'll come back and maybe we won't. "Keep pushing on. The water hole must be about eighteen miles ahead." "You're both coming with me." Into the dawn. "I reckon they're looking for water. They'll be back." "Were going to keep on marching till one of you tells the truth." "Maybe it will be in Hell, but somewhere one of you is going to talk, and it'll be the innocent one." Blinding heat! Billowing up from the gasping desert in suffocating waves. "Which one of you killed him?" "When your faces is raw and your tongues going to hate each other... it'll be then I'll learn the truth!" "You're getting to hate each other now." "Into the Sunset..." Another dawn... burnished dawn, harbinger of a heat... crazed day. The judge... suffering equally with the accused. "As soon as one of you talks, we'll go back to the wagons. There's water there." "That's a mirage... there's no water here." "Which one of you killed my brother?" "I... I didn't kill him." "You dirty sneak! You dirty liar!" "You can't kill me like you killed him!" "You can't shoot me when I'm not looking!" "He killed him! He did it and made her believe she was the one." "Your killing days are over. We'll be going back now." At last! The water hole. "There's Kiowas and there's a whopping lot of them." Insolent, but inclined to be friendly. Attracted by the shawl.

White man's camp there." "You got here just in time for the finish." "We can't fight. They'd clean us out in half a day." "One of us will have to go out to them." "We'll have to draw straws. I reckon." "Take the women away!" "This man killed my brother!" "He killed him and made is sister believe that she did it." "This man saw him do it!" "... and then he shot him from behind!" "This man's life belongs to me and God knows I want it... " "... but you all have got a bigger claim... and I'm giving him to you. " One of us has got to die and your claim to live ain't honest no more." "You'll go out to the Indians in the morning." "Not that!.. Not that!.. Kill me yourselves, but not this!" "They told me! I know!" Oh! I know! "Jane, help me! Help me!" "The torture stake! I can't stand it! Help me! Help me!" "I... I came to you... not ask justice, but mercy." "Don't let him go out to them." "Be merciful Let him die here!" I lied to you, but then I told you the truth, because I couldn't bear to see you suffering. Now... "I'll give him a chance... It"ll be him who'll do the deciding." "You've got until dawn to decide." "It's no use talking... he'll do it... And I'm going out at sun-up. You can get the train through." Indian strategy. The first faint ribbon of dawn. "If I do happen to go up there. and there ain't space for you two, I won't want to stay." "I reckon we'll be starting now." Santa Fe! The Threshold of the Promised Land. "No, I don't hate you. I'm only sorry for you." Her uncle. "Goodbye, Miss." "I am coming back." "Back by the river there's more people waiting, and maybe they'll be needing me." "Then some day... you'll come back?"
