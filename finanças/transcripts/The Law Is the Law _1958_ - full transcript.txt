This is not my town. I was not born here. In fact, we are from the Mediterranean Alps. The French Alps are on the left, and the Italian Alps on the right. "And that?" they will be thinking. It's obvious. The border that divides the two countries is very long. There is. But why are you zigzagging around here? For a very simple reason: everything Italian must be in Italy and everything French must be in France. Without that, what would be the point of a border? Anyway, everyone knows that a French tree it looks nothing like an Italian one, and an Italian hill has nothing in common with a French one. So, the town down there is called Assola ... ... and that is his French side, where I have lived for many years. There are half French and half Italian because ... ... the border is in the middle, dividing it into two parts just like cutting the hotel called "Las 2 Fronteras" into two parts where can you sleep with the head in France and the feet in Italy, and where mosquitoes enjoy the privilege of the two countries. Everything is fine in Assola and everyone is happy. Today, for example, on the French side is the national holiday while for us Italians, it is a normal day. The poor work, from the farmer ... ...Pastor... ... to those who take advantage. Between you and me, the border is a wonderful invention. Naturally, it would be better if there were no officers, especially... ... French Sergeant Ferdinando Pastorelli ... who has known me for a long time ... and considers me his worst enemy. But as a local proverb says: There is always a worm in the pear and an officer at the border. OMG! It has disappeared! Are there ghosts around here? Is incredible! ¡Ferdinando! - How's it going? - Very good, Giuseppe. What are you doing here? Strolling. What are you wearing there? Here? Water. - Water? - Yes Holy water for the Monastery of St. Michael. Holy Water? - This is brandy. - Don't tell me, brandy? - Try it - It's true It's a miracle! St. Michael has produced a miracle. Thanks, St. Michael. St. Michael has produced a miracle. Listen people! It's unbelievable, but true. No, it is not a miracle. It is an old tale. I told you, don't you remember? The fact that? Really? So isn't it a miracle? It is not a miracle, it has been a misunderstanding. Do not move! - This is not a miracle! - Stop, Giuseppe. Where is that idiot going? Stop, Giuseppe! Para! ¡Giuseppe! Giuseppe? Giuseppe? Para! Para! You know I will catch you. Do not make it harder. It will cost you dearly. Giuseppe, stop! If you take one more step, I shoot. You know me, I am correct. One two... Be quiet! The signal! - What? - The sign says "Silence". Speak louder! "Danger - SILENCE Falling stones" Always looking for excuses. Giuseppe, turn around. You're surrounded. In order to! I have caught you. Sight. What happens? You can't arrest me here because I'm in Italy. Are you crazy? You know the bridge is ruined. - Come on, before you hurt yourself - Stop! - That would be a "causus belli" - A what? - It's Latin - Latin? I see... Go. Just a little jump. What did I jump? You are nuts. - I'm here - Good! No hurry. I have time. Don't you have to go to town to see the parade? It's true! The parade! Hey, aren't you the drummer in the parade? No, my friend. I have never played the drum. - I'm the standard - bearer - Oh, excuse me! I have never played the drum. Help! - I knew it! - Call the fire department. Call an ambulance, call the mountain guides! I'm not insured, I need help! Save me, Ferdinando, I beg you. Save me! I can not. I must go back to France. Do not leave me here. Think of my children. Don't I have a son too? Yes, but I have four that eat like eight. Ferdinando! Very well. It is a favor. ¡Ouch, ouch! Mis huesos. - Thank God you found me - If not, I wouldn't be like this - I wouldn't be like this - Take my hand My bones! Help! - Fuck good - I'm good fuck! You are idiot! The jug! If that's what matters, let me go. Help! Pull me! - I'm so scared! - Take it easy - Do I look scared? - Spooky! I'm so scared. - What did you have for breakfast this morning? - Onions Couldn't you have coffee with milk for breakfast like the others? Giuseppe: I'm not playing here! Ferdinand, my feet don't touch the ground, it's dangerous. - Help! - You are in trouble Smuggling, flight crime ... You will get at least three months in jail. Are you trying to arrest me on Italian soil? What right do you have? This is abuse of power. Also, did I ask you for something? Didn't you ask me for help? If everyone who asked for help was arrested, this would be chaos. Okay, I'll throw you down there. Not! I give up! Go! Are you giving up Your hat. - My God, how scary! - You should be ashamed - If you get scared so easily, change jobs - How scary! Would you mind doing it again? My brother hasn't seen anything. Let me go. I know why you arrested me. - By scam. - No, for revenge. You never forgave me for marrying your first wife. Are you crazy. You think that by marrying my first wife ... ... you can smuggle. Feelings are feelings ... ¡Oh, Ferdinand! ¡Oh, Ferdinand! I can not believe it. Are they parading without me? It's your fault. Come on, move! What are you running for? Come on, move! One, two! One, two! Careful! Do not step on the border. Squeeze. Do not step on the border. Stay on that side. Do not cross the border. Caution! Apretáos, apretáos! Stay on that side. It is their fault. I got him smuggled brandy. It was my duty, you know. I don't know about the border, but punctuality is vital for us . - Do not tread! - It's okay. - Giuseppe, where are you going? - To the Bastille. - Giuseppe, have you become French? - By force. Haven't we done enough show yet? - Come on, if you act the same. - Stop it! To the dungeon! - I already pay the fine. - You have money? No, but if you allow me to go home to get it. Yes, of course, you go home, have a coffee and take a shower. Who have you taken me for? Go! - How suspicious you are! - Hey, dad! Where are you going? Come here! Come! Move on! - What is happening Dad? - Ask Mom for 20,000 lire. 20,000 for a flight crime? 50,000! Go! This is how you kill small businesses. You've really dated your father. - What do you have to say about my father? - Nothing Nobody knows who it is. Not like yours, which has his photo in every police station in Naples. Sure, because it is photogenic. So you haven't come out to him. Hey dad, has your flag been stolen? I want to be a veteran too. Don't be in such a hurry! If you are a prudent boy. The second woman is not bad either. Do not start! Didn't you have enough with the first one? Father? Mom wants to know what you need so much money for. Tell your mother that if she doesn't pay the fine, she will go to jail. - Is that true, Dad? - In a way, yes. Come on, go! Fast! Attention to my orders. High! Break ranks! - Go! - Hey, okay, no pushing. Where were you? What happened? I was arresting him. You have the whole year to do it, did you have to choose this day? It is he who has chosen it. Come on, we'll talk after the honor wine . Man, the funny one, are we parading this year with the kids? Last year almost burned ... ... the bishop with the fireworks. This, to Mr. Bonnefont it almost gave you something because you were late. These things should not happen in the police force. - Of course not. - Is right. - Think more with your head. - Not in service hours, let's go! - Do not push me. - It's my ways, let's go! Look at him, he got caught. - Giuseppe! - Yes? Where is the jug? Mrs. Garrafón sends greetings. He has not been able to come. He has had a fall and has hurt himself. ¡No! Yes, I have seen it, poor thing. Detuve to Giuseppe just in ese moment. - Do you know her? - Oh no. - And you? - Me? Not. - Neither is he. - What a pity! She's lovely. A bit heavy, but high spirited. Silence, please, silence. Be quiet! Dear citizens, let's toast ... ... for the prosperity of our beloved city ... ... that today, like yesterday, and in many circumstances ... ... has outlived the glory of the past. It's good, huh? Are you here! I am happy to toast an honest man. - Thanks. - I was talking about you. - But Ferdinand. - Forget me. The more I look at you, the more similar I find your mother. - What a pity! - What do you mean? I thought your mother would be a beautiful woman ... Moron! Don't joke with my mother, she was a saint. You will not find people like her. She was beautiful, kind, sincere, and religious. Italian women are all the same. She never wanted to get married. He preferred to educate you in his own way. The same thing happened to me, he always pushed me down the right path. Well, he shouldn't have pushed you too hard. - To your health Donadieu. - To yours. If she could see you from above, she would be delighted. - You are right. - Let's toast! - To your health, boss. - To yours. Imagine! 20 years of service and I'm already a sergeant. Think about it, it's fantastic! He's right, he deserves it. - Yes I admit it. - I'm proud of you, son After all, I brought you a little bit into the world. Yeah true. You don't know, boss. Guess where I was born. - I do not know. - Try it. - I do not know. - Say something. I was born in your kitchen ... In his cook. No, boss, let's not exaggerate. In your kitchen. - What? - What happens? - Were you born in his kitchen? - Yes, ask Donadieu. It's fun, huh? More fun than you think. - What do you think, boss? - Me? I find it very funny. - He was born in the kitchen. - It is fun. - Renato, come here! Did you bring the money? Mom says she prefers you to go to jail. Have you heard? Have a family for this. Who would tell you to divorce her? You wanted it and you got it. Now it's your problem. Why are you laughing? I laugh because I'm going to put you in prison. To me? Does prison make you funny? - I'm not laughing at that. - Then what about? I laugh because you were born in a kitchen. And the kitchen is worse than jail. - No, it is not. - If it is. - Not! - Of course it is. I assure you that jail is worse than cooking. The kitchen is worse than jail. Goodbye. Hey! Where are you going? - To home. To my house. - To jail you mean. Nerd. You have no right to arrest me. You don't even have the right to wear a customs uniform. Not to be French! - So ... - I'm not French? You were born in the kitchen. Where is the kitchen? In Italy, look! - And that? - Let's analyze the case. You were born in Italy ... ... of an Italian mother and an unknown father. - Then what are you? - French. No way. You are Italian! Are you crazy? Me, Italian? Why? Is it a dishonor to be Italian? It is not, I respect Italians. You are saying that I am Italian because I was born in a kitchen. So if I was born in a stable, am I a horse? - No, you would be an ass. - An ass? Enough Pastorelli! No fighting. - No, Giuseppe is right. - It is Italian. I'm italian? And am I not entitled to wear the uniform? - Can't I arrest you? - Not! I will teach you what I can or cannot do. Go! You are going to jail. What do you say, mayor? Is this a joke or what? I hope not. All Italians are the same. When you are abroad, you treat your compatriots with kicks. Enough! Be quiet. Thank God I'm wearing the uniform, otherwise I would have taught you by now. - What do you mean? - Me? Nothing. Then be still! What? Okay let's go. - Move on. - Do not push! Again? Do you walk in here like a bar or what? - It's an officer's duty. - You're wrong. - Be still. - You will see. First, I have a question. A man born in Italy ... ... of Italian mother and unknown father , what is it? Wait a minute, let me think. Born in Italy, Italian mother ... ... unknown father ... He's Italian. - Italian? - See you. - Are you sure it's Italian? - Sure. More questions? What if at birth he is registered with the French mayoralty? - What is he? - What is it? That is more difficult. Italian mother ... Born in Italy ... ... Unknown father ... But registered with the French mayor's office? - Correct, registered in France. - It's French. French! You see it? Where is? Mommy. Dad is back. - Good morning Dad. - Good morning Kids. So they didn't put you in prison today? - What have you brought me? - Leave me, son. I'm tired. I come from abroad. Good morning dear. All good? - Where is Marisa? - In the shop. The fine was a lie. An excuse to get my money. I'm going to wash my hands, I'll be right back. Sure, I find the money under the stones. We do not have the precise. And every day something is missing. - Yes? - Do you know that children need - new aprons for school? - Not And do you know how much the plumber asked to fix the faucet? 2,000 lire, you hear? And you come asking for 50,000 more. - You took another hit for nothing. - I haven't given it. - Then why are you so late? - What time is it? - Both. - Oh God. That is why he was so hungry. My little. What do we have here? Antoinette, what is this? Have you eaten it all? We weren't expecting you. We thought you were in jail. You could have put my part aside. And what if you were there for more than a week? Is incredible. A poor man who works honestly all day ... ... trying to circumvent the law to get home and find ... ... just the remains of a fish. That's too much! Stop or I'll give you a cake. Take this. A boiled egg. - A boiled egg? - Yes, a boiled egg. You know I can't stand French food. I see that we continue. Didn't you hear what I told you? - Dad, Mario wanted to buy ... - Yes, Mario wanted to buy. Did you want to buy a calendar? Here it is. - Here - The truth is that ... - The truth is that it costs 500 lire. - 500 lire! - Father! - Peaceful. Luckily I get new orders. - Here you are, 500 lire. - Good afternoon Miss. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Dad, it was a 1951 calendar . Sure, older calendars have more value. I told you I didn't want to see you with those companies. - He's a good boy. - But he's wearing a uniform. Cops, sheriffs ... All of them in uniform. Now get out of here. ¡Giuseppe! What did you say to Marisa to make her cry? Come and look at your idiot first husband. You've seen? You don't know what you've gotten rid of, my daughter. That man could have been your father. Damn it. I am going to organize a process that will not set foot in France again in all his life. I don't have a decent pen. How are we going to fight criminals, if they do n't provide us with weapons? Pastorelli, please do not disturb management at this time. - That's an order? - No, it's advice. - Ah okay. - Look at this. Do you remember article 2? Access to the French customs administration ... ... is allowed only to French subjects. Am I not a subject? It will not question ... ... the words of a smuggler ... ... and those of a French customs officer. You know me, boss. I do, the administration though he does not trust people, if not of the documents signed and dated validly. It is up to you for now to present proof of your nationality. - Bring a birth certificate - A certificate? - Which? - Which? Yours. - Is this advice? - No, it's an order. I see. Giuseppe, if I could catch you ... Excuse me boss, I'll be right back. That is not a customs officer, it is a broker. CAREFUL. PAINTING. I can enter? Sorry to bother you, mayor. Oh, Pastorelli, pass. Thank you, mayor. I'll just steal a minute from you. If possible, I would like a birth certificate. We were precisely talking about your case. - Unfortunately ... - Why unfortunately? A registration error was made. - A falsehood - What kind of falsehood? - Is my name on the record? - If it is. - That's the mistake. - The falsehood. The person who registered it had no right to do so. - That he had no right? - Not! You were not born in the Maritime Alps, but in the province of Cuneo. I am also from Cuneo. I live in Plaza Garibaldi. - Nice to meet you. - Excuse me. - Wait a minute, Mr. Mayor. - Besides. I don't look like someone from the province of Cuneo. This joke.. ... it has lasted a long time, I was born where I was born and I am French. That is what you say. I know why you are playing with me. Because you are smugglers. Once i caught you And now you want to get me in trouble, right? I forbid you these comments. We are chancellors. And that? - Excuse me, Mr. Mayor. - Calm down, Pastorelli. Remember that today is a party and we have ... ... come here to help you. I understand. So what have they decided? - We can't help you. - Not? Article 145 of the penal code. No officer ... ... using false documents ... may be legally forgiven , etc, etc ... Why "etc, etc ..."? Please listen! They can fall from 5 to 10 years of forced labor. - No. - You know better than I do. - The law ... - ... is the law. Look, we can't pay attention to your certificate ... ... because Donadieu shouldn't have registered you here. - But in Italy - Dinadieu? - Donadieu? Gaspar Donadieu? - Naturally, this is your signature. Go talk to him. I will do it! I'll find the solution, word. - Donadieu, where are you? - Is that you, Ferdinand? What happens? What a shame! While you 're here putting labels a poor man does not know where he was born. - What are you talking about? - Do not interrupt me. Why did you register me as French? - Me? - If you. When I was born. - When you were born? - Exactly. Oh yeah, because it was raining that day. And that? The French mayoralty was closer than the Italian. And if it had been hailing ... Would I have joined the bowling society ? Do you forget to thank me for believing that you are French for 45 years? How? You should thank me instead of being furious. Thanks. Would you mind telling me what will happen now that I know that I am Italian? You are not the only one. There are 48 million like you. Already. They can do it without me. But did you have to bring me into the world in a kitchen? To me? Surrounded by that smell ... ... with onion and fried fish. Does it seem respectable to you? - It was a holiday. - Holiday? Yes. People were even sleeping in bathrooms. You couldn't wait for there to be a free room. Oh I'm sorry. If I had known, I would have made a reservation. What need did you have to tell that you were born in a kitchen? Out of habit. Makes people laugh. I can assure you that no one laughed that day. Especially your poor mother. He was gritting his teeth and screaming. It happened at this table. - At this table? - Here you gave the first cry. I hit you here like this. I cleaned you up and taught you to everyone. You were cute, then. And so small. Sure, you didn't have teeth then. - You've changed a lot since that day - It's true, now ... ... with everything that happened, I'll have to start over. Here they do everything with oil? I want them to bring it to me ... with butter. How come you don't run anymore? Are you tired? What is the problem? An error in the registration. It is no longer French. - And what is? - Italian Your papers, please. They are perfectly. It is that they are authentic. It is I who is a phony. - It does not seem. - but it's true. - He was a good soldier. - Yes it was. - I know how to use artillery. - That doesn't prove anything. It proves that I have done my duty. By mistake you are a veteran but that doesn't mean that you have to wear that uniform, unauthorized. I advise you to regularize your position immediately. - Where? - In your country, Italy. What do I tell my wife? Clever? - Down the other street. - Very well. Nice to see you again. Thanks. The pleasure is mine. - What's in here? - What? What's up? More holy water? How do you know? - Where did you find it? - Where did I find it? Waiting! Well. What is it, cologne? No, it is natural amber perfume essence . It must cost a million and a half francs. Do we check it? - 5,000 francs. - Stop! - 10,000 francs. - Please don't ruin me! And haven't you ruined me? Look at me. You are splendid. This suit suits you better than the customs suit . You would like to see me with the convict. - Because? - Because, why? Because I'm going to break this bottle on your head. No, don't hit me with the bottle. It is not mine. Hit me on the head. I have a very strong hammer. I dislike you. You are not a man. - You are disgusting. - What is all this? Have you finished? The children are sleeping. - What are you doing here? - I heard you. How do you appear dressed like this when there is a stranger? Me, a stranger? Her first husband? If I knew her before you. - Without the nightgown. - Go up to your room. - Listen, get out! - Yes. If you wake up the children, I'll be back, understood? - Very clear. - Do not worry. - Good night dear. - Good night. - And now you'll find out. - What is the problem? - Are you asking me that? - Take it easy. I'll fix it, whatever it takes. - Your? - Sure, I know a lot of people. I know people of all kinds. Even brother of a cousin of a cardinal. - And what do I do with a cardinal? - What are you doing with a cardinal? What question! What kind of Italian are you? I want to be French. - First, you will have to be Italian. - Italian, why? To be able to naturalize as French. - But how? - First of all, you must obtain italian documents because now you are nothing. You do not exist. You are not here. Oh what? Me. Do I exist or not? Yes, at least one foot. I'm going to test these two for that of the witnesses. It's a lovely day, huh? But it's a shame the sky is clouding over. - Excuse me, what time is it? - Don't do theater If you need witnesses, we are two professionals. Delinquent youth. - 100 lire each? - 200. Follow me Ferdinand, everything settled. 5,000 lire for both of us. Prepayment. And for you nothing? - You do me a great favor - And friendship doesn't count? Mr. Ferdinand Pastorelli, the two witnesses. - Montanari Ugo. - Bellocci Vincenzo. Lifelong friends. Oh well! Nice to meet you. Listen, this is illegal. I hope you don't ask us for false testimonies. Ferdinand, were you born in Italy, yes or no? - Yes. - Then there is no false testimony. What a pity! They want double the fee for a false testimony. What a generation! - Good evening Pastorelli. - Good night. - Everything solved, I'm already Italian. - That's predictable. You started by leaving the flag with the driver and then ... Tell the driver not to brainstorm. I will be French very soon. Really? If you believe it ... Where are you going? - Sorry - Are you thinking of changing? I know these things don't happen in the police. Sure! If all the French did the same. They would be Italians. Forgives. You can go. But the residence permit we'll see. - Boss! - Good night. - Show me your papers - But if you know me. - That's why I ask. - No problem. Oh welcome back, dear mate. Co-worker. I wish you didn't use that word with me. We have saved the site for you when you rejoin. - Very kind. - Come in and look. Your suit is waiting for you, just as you left it. My pen. My notebook. The ammunition from my revolver. Sure! It's like you are with us. - I'll be back soon. - I hope so. - Excuse me - Where are you going? - Me? - If you. - What do you want? - What's in this suitcase? - What suitcase? - Do not mess with me. Open it! - Is? - Yes You have pajamas like mine. - Just a coincidence. - Goodbye. Espérame, Ferdinand. - You see it? There's nothing smuggling - It's not your own. - Sorry to disappoint you - Get out of here! Wait for me Ferdinand, don't go so fast. Espérame Ferdinand. Sorry I'm so looking forward to seeing my family again. With all the excitement you must be tired. I'll take it to you. No, leave it, you've already helped me enough. It was a pleasure. Come on, I'll take it to you. - This is not my suitcase - What happened? It must be a mix-up, a change. - What's in here? - We have the same pajamas. Just a gift for my wife. Some silk stockings. Is your wife a centipede? Oh my dear Pastorelli. I am so glad to see you again. - Me too, mayor. - Is everything solved now? - In a way, yes. - I'm glad for you. - Goodbye. - Goodbye and thank you, Mr. Mayor. Listen, Mr. Bourride. I think this is not working properly. It will have a small flaw. Don't worry, deputy. It's not possible. This spoils my collection. If you can wait a minute, I'll fix it. Jacques, fix this. The deputy is waiting. Please excuse a moment. Ferdinand, our deputy is here. Come and tell him about your suitcase. No, you will not be interested. It's your job to make uninteresting things interest you. - It could be useful to us. - Go. Okay, but I feel ashamed. Does not matter. It is the perfect opportunity. This is my son-in-law, he is a customs officer. Customs officers are the backbone of the country. Thank you very much deputy. Why don't you tell the deputy about your friend? Excuse me, deputy. I need to ask you a favor. - What is it? - It's for a friend, a colleague ... ... that you have a problem with your marital status. Those things only happen in France. Well, I heard about it. The man who was born in the kitchen. Exactly! A good man. He wants to know, if after having legally obtained Italian papers ... - Good - Everything is in order. He wants to know if he can become French again. But your friend is an idiot. Ferdinand: No, I know him well. Yes, he's a jerk. - He is not, I know him well. - But he's a jerk. Don't make conclusions. Until his decision, he had been French. With the Italian papers, he implicitly acknowledged ... ... be a foreigner. That's why he 's an idiot. - Yes, but ... - I always share your opinion. And it's true because your friend is now 100% Italian. And that is the problem. What exactly is the problem? To be Italian? No, pretending to be French. This man has to be arrested for false identity. For falsification of documents. - Are you sure? - You think I don't know the law? I make the law. Well, I could do better. A law that makes a man an idiot ... ... can't listen to your conscience. - And what about your family? - Family? The idiot's wife and son. Why? Does the idiot have a wife and a child too? Well now, it doesn't. What? What? A false identity invalidates the marriage. The woman is single again and the son illegitimate. - Oh my God! - That is a misfortune! Can France really sink like this? Why are you so excited? I understand now! - Are you the idiot? - No, I'm not. I am, for giving my daughter. - Police! - Ferdinand! It is not the deputy who speaks, it is the friend. Runs! Is right! Flees! - Helene! - Ferdinand! I'm leaving, but I would like to stay. - Good Morning. - Good Morning. - Mr. Ferdinand Pastorelli? - Not here. - We haven't seen him. - What a pity! We were coming to ... ... give you the residence permit - The residence permit? - We'll be back another time. - Goodbye. What can I say? - Good Morning. - Good Morning. - Is Mr. Giuseppe La Paglia here? - Because? - Just to provide us with information. - Come in. Here. I have free from 7 to 9 pm - We can never see each other during the day. - Better not? - What happen? - Where is my father? Father? Are you there! Comes back! Have you had a good trip, Mr. Palomo Thief? Let's see what you brought Uncle Giuseppe. Saccharin. Well! Thanks. Let's see what we have here. And what have you brought Uncle Giuseppe? - Well done! - Father. - Yes? What's up? - You have a visitor. Let's go outside. - Good Morning. - Good Morning. - They are robber pigeons, right? - Forgives? - I said robber pigeons. - No, they are messenger pigeons. They leave, but they always come back. We come for information. sobre Ferdinando Pastorelli. Ferdinando Pastorelli? We better get home. Gone, dirty pigeons. They are worse than children. - What was your name? - Ferdinando Pastorelli. The Turin police station wants to clarify certain issues. - The police station? - The case of Pastorelli it is not very clear. He lives on the border. - I don't know him - What? Don't you know Pastorelli? I'm not from here. I come from Naples. Let's go outside! Mr La Paglia, it's just a formality. I know. It's what people always say. So, going back to that man ... What was his name? - Little Shepherds. - Little Shepherds. He is a spy, a murderer, a criminal, and you will say: "But Mr. La Paglia has you covered." No, no, nothing like that! I don't mix. Dear man ... What are you doing? - I'm writing down what it says. - I deny everything. I have not opened my mouth. But you know Pastorelli. You cannot deny it. Good Morning. What happens? We just wanted to know if you know Mr. Pastorelli. What are you doing? Why are you playing the idiot? Of course we know him. I was his first wife. If you want to stay out of trouble, you will have to answer the questions. - It is clear? - Very clear. Listen, I have a great idea. Now I will send you a beautiful anonymous letter. I am jobless. - Do not exaggerate. - I am jobless. I am French illegally. I have lost everything. I have no wife or child. Go! You will remarry your wife and recognize your son. Recognize my son? A son who wants to be the spitting image of his father ... ... and has been classified as a bastard son? - I'll jump in the river. - Do not be an idiot. Moron? Sure i'm an idiot Since the day I was born I started arriving at the wrong place. It is important to be on the correct side of the border. Excuse me. Relax, you are an honest man . But in another way. Anyway on one side or the other of the border I am always an idiot. The deputy told me and he is an expert in these things because he sees a lot of idiots every day. Do not say that. Giuseppe is to blame. - If I catch him. - Where are you going? - I want to kill him. - What are you doing? Take it easy. I shouldn't listen to my conscience ... seeing that the problem is not easy. You should try to respect the law. - I can't take it anymore. - Do not lament! Things will work out. I am outside the law. So I regret it. - Let me go. - Wait. I wanna go! I want to go to sleep. Excuse me, is Mr. Pastorelli here? I am Pastorelli. - Come please. - Where? To the police station. Between. Here it is! - You deserve to go to jail. - Calm down, ma'am. - Because? What have I done? - Come here. Pastorelli, you wore a uniform knowing the meaning of "duty." Yes. I know that duty is duty, outside of the uniform that is worn. Oh, sorry. We must clarify your matter. - Are you an Italian citizen? - Also. - "Also not. - "Also not. You got the Italian papers, you are Italian. It is these documents. And since there is no divorce in Italy, Mrs. Antonietta Parodi, Mrs. Pastorelli, - is still his wife. - And I'm still her husband. - Sure - I told him I'm Mrs. La Paglia. And I thought I didn't have a wife. But now you have two, in the eyes of the law you are a bigamist. - A bigamist? - Yes, the papers say so. So I'm a bigamist. - And the Lady? - Me? Is she bigame too? Sorry, Antonietta. I'm waiting for instructions from Cuneo. For the moment, I am unfortunately obliged to keep you here. What? Are you going to put me in prison? My lady, I cannot ignore the law. What about my children? I've got four. Well! That's the tricky part. - Where is the Penal Code? - Here it is. - Thanks. - No problem. According to the law, they are still yours. Well! That's what the law says. What do I care what the law says? I am an honest mother with four children. What is my fault that he has been playing stupid? Put him in jail, I don't care! It's enough. The law is the law. Put them in prison. - Oh my God! - Go! How generous the Italians are. You lose a woman and they give you another. You lose a child and they give you four. And Giuseppe nothing. He has no wife or children. Thanks, sergeant. Good morning, Marisa. Dad, Mom is at the station. Why? He went to testify almost an hour ago. We shouldn't collaborate with the police. He knows! - Hey! - Who is that? Up here. Oh, it's you. - Giuseppe! - What are you doing up there! - I'm in jail. You do not see me? - Really? You who have always enjoyed putting others behind bars. And now you are. This is very funny! More than what you believe. Waiting! Are you laughing because you are in jail? No, I laugh because you are not there. It's better to be outside than inside, right? It depends. In your case, on the contrary. - Wait a minute. - With great pleasure. Antonietta, look at that one. This is your husband. Here's your wife. Congratulations! You will be happy! Moron! Fool! He's turned Italian because of you, and now I'm bigame. Hang on a minute. If you are bigame, what am I? A cuckold. I see. What are they laughing at? He's just talking nonsense. He's here because he's being transferred to the asylum. You should not listen. Let's go outside! What a chore! And are you two alone? Sure! Just me and my wife. How stupid! - Come down here I'll show you - I'm busy now. I'll teach you not to laugh. I'll show you what Giuseppe La Paglia is made of , you idiot! Pastorelli, the sergeant wants to see you. You too, ma'am. - Sargeant? - Yes. Go. - What does he want? - Nothing, wow. Good Morning. Excuse me I'd like to speak to the sergeant. - He's busy. - Sorry, I didn't hear you. - He's busy. - Well, let me talk to the superior. It is busy too. - Then I'll talk to you - Don't you see I'm busy? Have a seat. There is no way. I'm first to speak to the sergeant. - Well, do you see? Everything will work. I think so. I have spoken on the phone with Cuneo. If I hadn't stopped you sooner Now I couldn't set you free - You can go out. - Thanks! But now you will be at our disposal. And in the meantime, I'm under surveillance. It was my duty, Mrs. Pastorelli. Little Shepherds no. ¡Señora La Paglia! - The court will decide. - It's okay. - We can go? - You can. - One moment! I have to enter. - No, you have to wait. Is incredible! For this we pay taxes. Mario, you have to do something. My wife is in the dungeon with that man. I know. But, what can i do? What can you do? I'm the make me laugh on the streets. How do you catch that Pastorelli ...! What do you have to say about Pastorelli? I'll cut off his hands. They are mine. - You're dating my daughter. - It's true, and? Do you want my consent? - Take me to my wife. - Now? - Arrest me. - I can not. - Because? Do me that favor. - But there is no reason. - Does there have to be? - Yes. Do you want a reason? Take your reason. - What's going on? - I have done it. - It was an accident. - No, it wasn't. I have done it on purpose. - Because? - For fun. I see. We are going to put you in the dungeon. - Finally. You see it? - Walking. A pleasure. Thanks. You can go back to your husband now. Come with me. - I am free! - What a scare you have given us. - I would have come for you. - I brought you your scarf. - Thank you. You think of everything. - One moment! - Good morning, Sergeant. - Good Morning. Here are your cigarettes. - It was a gift. - Your purse. - Your documents. What is this? - My military record. Oh, the military card. One moment. Read this, sergeant. My son-in-law is an excellent soldier. - Oh, not that. - But it's true. Very well! Congratulations. You fought in the war with France. - Yes. - And he was cited in the warrant twice. - I just did my duty. - Of course. Hang on a minute! And in France they say that this does not prove anything. In France it may not, but here it proves ... Which is the word? Here is sender. Sender? What does that mean? That you have not responded to the mobilization order. But I did fight the war. - In France, not in Italy. - But I can't divide myself. - Sergeant, you're exaggerating. - Give me back my card. Pastorelli, enough is enough. The document is clear. Do you know what you are in the eyes of the law? - No. - A deserter. - Me? A defector? - You are right. Me, a deserter? That I have fought for my country for 5 years. I who have risked my life for France. Repeat what you said. To the dungeon! This will calm you down. Me? A defector? This is a scandal! I'll warn the authorities. Outside! These things never happen in France. Do not worry. Your dad will have the last word. Thank you. You're very kind. Goodbye. Do not worry. When I'm interested, I pay for the machine and go out. Listen, give this to your buddy. Goodbye. See you. Mario, tell Marisa that I give you my permission. Joseph, going, Vamos. C'mon C'mon! Take it easy! If you had come 5 minutes earlier, you would have seen your wife. How? And where is she now? - We have released it - But that's terrible! Where are you going? Indoors! Open, open! It was a judicial error. ¡Abrid! How do you let someone go for no reason? I'm going to cut off my hands. I will cut them to you. Ferdinand, wait a minute. We are men of the world, right? I admit that I have exaggerated a bit, but you did not have to be offended. - Don't take it with me. - I would love to do it. What remains of Ferdinand Pastorelli? I have been deprived of my family, my home and my country. I only had one thing left. - And I've lost it. - The fact that? My honor. That's all? Go. I am a defector. I who have fought in the war for nothing. I am not a man, I am a mistake. Oh yeah, you're a bastard, Ferdinand. - I'm sorry for you. - Nerd. Maybe one day they tell me that I have changed my sex. The only solution is to disappear. - Tonight? - Why wait? - They can see you. - it will be too late. It's serious, but I'll get my freedom. You are right. Freedom above all. I can help? - Thank you - It's a pleasure. Do you think this will hold? You've gotten fat lately. - Maybe because of the Italian food - Idiot, don't say those words. Would you mind if I used it after you? - You too? - Sure, what am I doing here alone? - You're sure? - Sure. Friendship is precious. - Ferdinand! - Goodbye, Giuseppe. Sorry, Ferdinand. I would like to know how you plan to do it. - Do you want to go first? - No, thanks. After You. Do not lose more time. - Cast? - Is better. Well! It will help me have more courage. Goodbye, dear Giuseppe. Hey, stop! Are you crazy? - Have you thought about it? - Of course I do. Don't you want to disappear? Yes, but I thought you meant escape. Me, escape? Oh no! People may say anything to me, but not that I am a coward. He preferred to die to dishonor. That will be said of me. Oh very well. When you were French, you fought for France. - Sure - Right! And now you feel disgraced because you have not fought for Italy. - Yes - Good. Now if it is discovered that you are Turkish. Would you feel disgraced for not having fought for Turkey? - Yes. - You're crazy. Hang yourself, for stupid. - Ferdinand, don't go on! - Leave me alone. - What are you trying? - I want to die. - Have you gone crazy, Ferdinand? - It's enough. - I want to die. - Ferdinando, stop it! - Come with me. - But I haven't done anything. - What have I done? - Go. ¡Abrid, abrid! I will pay the damages. I do not want to be alone. Come in, dear Pastorelli. Everybody makes mistakes. I just took orders from Cuneo. - Do you know article 8? - Article 8? No, but that is no longer a problem. I have already bravely accepted my fate. Any citizen who has fought in the army ... ... without government authorization ... ... it is automatically stripped ... ... of your Italian nationality. - Stripped off? - That says here. You have not been Italian since you were 20 years old. So this is the end. As a consequence, you are not a bigamist. - Am I not a bigamist? - Not. - Deserter? - Either. - So am I free? - Correct. I am free. Free? I am free! - Long live freedom! - Not at all. - What does it mean? - I have an order to accompany you to the border. To the border? Go. Go! Goodbye! - Wait - Very good. Hello. Boss, I'm bringing you here. It has been stripped of Italy. I greet you France, land of freedom. - Your papers - Papers? But if I don't have. Good Morning. What a joy to return to my country. - What country? - I'm not Italian anymore. - I'm French again. - What? ¡Hey, sargento! - Sergeant Maresciallo. - Come back a moment, please. If people who weren't Italian were French, it would be very easy. Listen Sergeant, I can't let this man in. - Out of here. - How? What are you telling me? I have been ordered to bring him to France. - Do you hear? - Go. - What do we mean "come on"? - You're not French, you can't ... ... stay here. And it is not Italian. You can't stay here. - That I am? - Be still. I would just like to know if I exist or not. - In the eyes of the law, no. - Not! If I understand correctly, the presence of a man does not count. Just one paper. The law is not made to be debated. In Italy, in France, and anywhere. The world revolves around the law, identities, roles, etc. Soon we will need a permit to live. And without it we will not be able to breathe. Well. I admit that I am guilty. But guilty of being born in a kitchen ... ... where some assholes put a border. Border! - What a great invention! - Don't make your case worse. He is insulted at the border. You, a customs officer! I am not a customs officer. I am nothing anymore. I'm nothing, don't you understand? But I want to be someone who is talked about in the newspapers. And I'll go to prison, until I have no other choice. But at the end of the day I will end up there for one thing or another. But I'll be there for something due to mental imbalance, for having to deal with people like you. Bye, see you at the trial. Damned! What a bad luck! Sight! They are shooting from the mountain. Huye! Run away and take cover! They are shooting from the mountain. They shoot from the mountain! Run, run away! Who is it? Who shoots? - Who? - Ferdinand. - He's going to kill us! - Are you crazy? The madman is him. I found this letter in the kitchen. - Not! - Yes! Listens. Dear bicharraco ... You call me bicharraco. I inform you that everyone has made fun of me. Under these circumstances, I'm going to erase the map after notice to the following people. Alberto Malandain, chief of gendarmes. Augusto Marozzi, Chief of Police. Antoine Calandré, chancellor of the country and smuggler. Etc ... They're all on the list. - I am? - Yes. You are number 13. And you? - I'm in the postscript. - How? If I don't supply you with provisions I will top the list. With respetos, Ferdinando Pastorelli, Former customs officer and excellent marksman. - This was the letter. - Quick, let's run! If I sent you supplies, will you take me off the list? I can't promise you anything, but I'll do everything I can. Giuseppe, what trouble have you gotten yourself into? I advise you to add a bottle of white wine. The oldest is from 1954. - Sure - What's next? Who knows what will happen? It has gone mad. He's shooting everyone. Donadieu, este es from 1919. Take the one on the left. Drop them and grab the 1954 one. The 1919 one is for me. Donadieu, come for a moment. No, no, give me that bottle. It is a private harvest. - Leave her. - I also have the right to drink. Of course. To anger Ferdinando. Sight. What is written on the label? Two Frontiers Came 1919. Bottled by whom? I'll tell you by whom. For a liar, look! In 1919, the border ran through the corner of the hotel as everyone believed. When Ferdinand was born, the kitchen was in France. I did it for hygiene reasons. The border crossed the sink. Not! You did it to attract tourists. To earn money. Do you think you can move a border from the sink to the kitchen ... ...Just like that? Fool! Giuseppe, I'd rather not talk about it. You know that borders cannot be changed. You have already seen what has happened. It starts with shots and you end up on the front line and someone loses their life and people say they die for the country. No, you must have died for a bottle of wine. - Don't say that word. - Shut up. Everyone should know that Ferdinand is French. Listen, Ferdinand is French! Hey, Ferdinando! Where are you? Where are you? Ferdinand, you are French! ¡Pastorelli! ¡Pastorelli! Ferdinand, come out! Everything has been cleared up. Ferdinand, where the hell are you? Ferdinand, come out, everything is settled. Ferdinand, hall! It's all Donadieu's fault. Do not worry. You know that I am your friend. You betrayed me, you damn thing. My God, he killed him! It is not possible, it was not me. ¡Giuseppe! Giuseppe. God, what have I done? Giuseppe, talk to me, say something. It is blood. No, it is wine. You are not dead! No Are you happy ... ... after everything I've done for you? Moron! What have you done for me? - Para - ¡Para, Little Shepherds! In order to! Leave him, everything is clear. - You are French, you are French. - It's not possible. Yes, you are French. You're lucky he's your friend. You were born with a star. - How lucky you are! - Giuseppe! Yes, I know but... The law is the law.
