Are they someone's? A wolf has no owner. Here's a wolf den. Here is the den. Look at how many there are. We'll give you a cause for celebration. Take that, take that, take that. That's the fourth. Now they won't be coming back to our lands any time soon. Take that. Take that, take that! Look at them hiding here. Step aside. Look, a blind one. That's the last one. Now you'll follow your brothers. Don't! What's wrong, Kurmash? Come here, come. Take this. - Hold it! - Why? You're all snotty like girl. - I am not like a girl. Then hit him. - I won't. - Hit! - I won't. - You won't? - No. - Why? - I won't. - What did I say? I won't. Eh you. You're shivering deliriously. You asked to come along yourself. Eh, my foal. I am ashamed of you, shivering so deliriously. Aren't you a Kyrgyz? Let's go. Wipe away the tears. As-salamu alaykum Hassen. - You're lucky! - Yes, thank you. I see your eagle has already matured. I haven't fed my eagle in 3 days. And on an empty stomach, the eye is sharpened. You spent six years underground, but you haven't forgotten your craft. - Who me? - Yes, you. You don't forget what you learn as a child. And you've got a lucky streak. Luck is the domain of fools. Don't confuse it with skill. So why doesn't Allah notice me? Don't rush, luck will visit you too. You've got a beautiful eagle, Hassen. And you've become a true Kyrgyz, Kurmash. Too bad I can't afford an golden eagle like that. Here, take it. No, I can't. - Take it, Akhangul, it's a gift. How could I repay you? This horse is all I've got. A good man will always find a way. - If you find it, it's yours. Your smile is good enough for me. Don't laugh at me, take it back. Akhangul, if you are my friend, you will take it. Come to aul with us. At least you'll drink liquid kumis. Thank you, Akhangul. In your mother's hands, even water will turn to kumis. It's so nice. It's baking gently under the sun. Listen, Hassen. Why did they hide you from the sun in the copper mines? They thought I'd grow some brains. And did you? Not really. I guess my head has holes in it. I see you lost your health there, and you were such a strong Kyrgyz. It's all right. He who lives until spring won't die in the summer. I reached my land, my home, so now I feel good. How is your honorable mother doing? She's healthy thanks to Allah. Hassen, you've traveled around, tell me what's new in the camps? What could be new? Other than maybe that the landlord's son got one more wife. Throw, Kurmash. Now your turn. Move to the side. Throw. Do you hear me? Atsenbek, enough games, come home. Let's go home, mother is calling you. Come on, come on, chop-chop. - I am coming, mother. Great, Gurbai, you're good. - Go away. What do you want? You're good, Kurmash, hit it. Hit, hit, Kurmash. Your turn. Guys, look, I'll ultimately win. You're good, Kurmash. Step aside, I didn't see you hitting the target, you are trying to cheat me. I won fair and square. Give me back the bones or I will... - I will call for my uncle. Call him, call the uncle, like he really needs you. How many times did you promise to call your father? Saying that he'll come and beat me in front of everyone. So where is your father? Where is he? He'll come back soon. - Where is he? In the mountains! You're lying. Don't make up fairy tales. Everyone knows that you don't have a mother or a father. You're an orphan. A little orphan. And you're little a thief. - You'll give it back. - Don't give in. Come in, you won them fairly. Hit him, hit him, Kurmash. Hey, you, why aren't you hitting? Then you. What are you looking at? Always hit first. Hit, I said. Hit. How many times do I have to teach you? Always hit first! You'll figure out who was right later. Hit. Give it all you've got. A foal. If you don't know how to hit, then learn to gnaw from a wolf pup. Look, guys, he's also blind. Where did you find him? On the red mountain, in the glacial valley, we found a wolf den. Give him back. - No. - Give him back. - No. - Give him back... It's my wolfy. If you want your wolfy, give me back my bones right this second. Here. Here. You can choke on them. The dogs will rip your wolfy's head off. You'll see, they'll rip it off. Grandmother. Grandmother, look, a wolfy. - Who brings a wolf into the house? Hassen told me that a blind wolf pup can be domesticated. Throw him out, I've never heard of a wolf becoming a dog. Throw him out, dear, he'll be showing his fangs before he can even walk. Just let him try, I'll tear his skin off. Surely he can become my friend, Hassen. - Of course, he can, my boy. How he'll turn out depends on you. Pour him some milk. He must know your smell. The smell of your home. You must be gentle and patient with him. Try to awaken a sense of love in him so that he doesn't grow up malicious. Kindness is capable of many things. - Of course, of course, son. Did you give him a name? I called him Kokserek. - Is that so? I want him to beat all the other dogs, and Dolgovyazov's too. Dear Hassen, your lungs need treatment. Why torture yourself? Better to seek treatment. If you let it slide, it will only get worse. Find a hot spring in the mountains, and swim there in the mornings. God willing, you'll get better. Thank you for the advice. Were there many cubs? - I killed five, this one is the sixth. Now the wolverine won't leave aul in peace. I think so too. - We'll see what happens. They say landlord's sheep were stolen. Really? I don't listen to that which isn't interesting to me. So that's how you think. Why should a solitary traveler care for what happens in other people's hearths? A wolf howling. We need to scare her off before she wakes up the entire aul. Allah. A bad sign. Let go, I said. Leave him alone. Didn't you hear what the uncle said? Leave him alone. Grandmother, tell me, where is my father now? I've told you before, my foal. He is not here, he died. And where is my mother? Your mother died too. Where are they buried? Very far away. On the other side of Alai Mountains. Was my father strong? I'll tell you tomorrow. Sleep. Grandmother? Listen, grandmother. You know, I remember my mother well, she was beautiful. You can't remember anything, you were too little. No, I remember everything. Mother used to say: when snow falls on water, the black fish are spawning. Allah. Extend my days. Don't leave my boy all alone. He won't know happiness without me. Extend my days for his sake, Allah. Kokserek, Kokserek, here, here. Here, here, Kokserek. Here. Here, come here. Eat, Kokserek. Good Kokserek. My Kokserek. Eat, eat, Kokserek. Eat. Eat, Kokserek. - Leave him alone. Why are you messing about with him so much? You need to be more strict with him. You devilish whelp. Barely on his feet and already bearing his teeth. Why are you teasing him? So that he grows meaner. Hassen said that malice is in his blood. Don't kill him, he's got pride. What kind of pride can a wolf have? He must know two things. How to be a watchdog for his keepers and how to be a wolf to strangers. If you antagonize him, it's you he will attack. Just let him try attack me. I'll tear his skin off. Don't touch him. So that's how you are. You don't like this? So defend him. Hit, hit me. Hit me. I won't. When I grow up and you'll get very old, I'll remind you of what you taught me. Give him back, give him back. He's my wolfy, give him back. You hear me? Give him back. Give him back. - Go away. Give him back, give him back to me. Kokserek. Give him back. Give him back. - Go away, I said. Kokserek. Kokserek. Kokserek. Kokserek. Kokserek. Kokserek. Kokserek. Good. Come on. Kokserek, rip those boots apart. Good boy. Hey you scoundrels. Go home. Enough messing about with these dogs. Get the people together right away. Tell them landlord's son is back. What's going on? As-salamu alaykum. It's been over a month since... I've been traveling about and looking for my flock of sheep. I've been to all the pastures and the sheep are still missing. Does anyone here know about my sheep? There are no thieves among us, Mirza. So where could they have disappeared? We didn't take your sheep. We didn't see anything. Listen, Mirza. Isn't life easier now? What's a hundred sheep to you? Less troubles for you. It's you, Hassen. Hassen, why aren't you greeting me? Or maybe greetings aren't customary in the backlands? No, not all. Only it's customary to greet the elderly first. That's true. We all live here like one big family. So don't think about stirring up the people here. What do you mean? What can you accuse me of? Other than feeding your hungry people with laughter. You'll answer for your laughs before Allah. You better bite your tongue. Although silence won't save a joker's head. Feel free to chop off my head, but I shall remain the keeper of my tongue. Better not step on a snake's tail. They say you ran from a Siberian prison? - Who needs the likes of me there? It's all right, there will come a time when you'll stop having fun. I'll deal with you in the district. Is it possible to escape from prison? You'd even escape from a millstone. In prison, they feed you for free, surely I'd stay there for the winter. You haven't forgotten your jokes. He who doesn't know how to laugh also doesn't know how to cry. At least detain me together with my camel. Enough, Hassen. I don't have time for jokes today. My sheep were stolen. But that's not all. They killed two of my guard dogs. The tracks brought me to your aul. Which means the sheep are here. I think the thief is here as well. Impossible. - You speak in vain, harming the honor of people, son of Ismailbek. All we have is black sand and water, our children are starving. For a hundred years, we had no conflict. Apa. And all my dear clansmen. Whoever gives up the thief will receive half of the stolen flock. Would it hurt to get fifty sheep? All right, today I am generous. I'll spare the entire flock for whoever finds the thief. You think I am sorry for the sheep? It's the truth I need. It's truth I need. So it's for truth you've come here? If you want truth, then go ahead and give away all your sheep to the poor. Then truth will come to you willingly. You hear? Everyone agrees. Hassen. You better keep quiet. What's the point of agitating the poor? I'll go inside every yurt and turn all the cauldrons upside down. That's not a manly deed. Don't touch the cauldrons. Look at my stomach. That's where I've hid Ismailbek's flock. All right. You're jolly man, Hassen. Sometimes, I also like to have fun with friends. Are you sure you should be be interfering here? I will find the thief, and if he happens to be from your aul, I'll spare no one. The old, the young, I will make sure that everyone is punished. Then you can defend them. Kokserek. Kokserek. Kokserek. Don't touch him. Don't touch him. Kokserek. Don't touch him. Kokserek. Allah, what will we do? Akhangul will kill you for this. Grandmother, let's get out of here. We'll run away. Silly boy, where can we go? It doesn't matter where. Let's go into the mountains. We'll find my father and mother. We can live with them. You're still a small child, first you need to grow up and gain strength. Do you have any other children aside from uncle Akhangul? I had many children. But they all died. Akhangul is the only one left. Who ripped this? Tell me, Kurmash. Me. Is that the truth? - Yes, it is. Why are you lying? - I am not lying. You think you can trick me? I know it's not you, but it's you who'll get the whip. I hate you! I did it on purpose. Here, look. Kurmash, don't. - Let it burn. Good boy, come here. Closer. Take off your pants. - I won't. - Take them off. Come here. You think he'll become good from the beatings? Why are you tormenting him? It's for his own good, so that he grows up to be a Kyrgyz. You must pity the orphan. A child needs strict upbringing from an early age. Apa. You understand. I don't have anyone. Just Kurmash. I couldn't even marry. I want him to become tough. Strong like stone. A child must be protected from cruelty and malice. You're wrong, Apa, he must know life. Then he'll be able to defend himself. There is too much evil everywhere. I've already decided. Let him hate me instead of hating the whole world. He's so little, aren't you rushing? Apa. You do the housework, I'll raise the child. Enough. Call him, I'll talk to him. Kurmash. Kurmash. Come to us, uncle wants to tell you something. He's forgiven you. Come here. Come. You're a man. We'll go to sleep early. And in the morning, we'll go into the mountains. Will you take Kokserek along? See the sheep? A whole flock. Whose are they? They are ours. Now we are rich. Thanks to Allah. You'll stay here until autumn. You'll graze them, only... You guard them well, all right? All right. I will visit you and bring you food. Kurmash. Come up to me. Listen, behind that hill, there is a sheep pen. It's not far from here. Tomorrow, you'll take the sheep there. Don't step away from them. Don't be afraid. After all, you've got Kokserek with you. It's me he is growling at. He probably remembered my whip. I almost forgot. Here. A treat from grandmother. Tomorrow she'll visit you herself. Take care. Akhangul, what you're doing is no good. Bring back the sheep to the landlord. So you are following me? You'll destroy everyone with your sheep. - So you've tracked down the thief! Landlord will pay you well. Get rid of them! - Don't meddle in my affairs. You bastard. Hassen. Hassen. Know this, if you sell me out, I will chew your throat out. That you can do, you're strong. Did you lose your mind because of the sheep? You are strangling your own friend! Hassen. I know you won't betray me. You're a true Kyrgyz. Maybe you want to... Watch over my sheep? You understand? I'll pay you well. Looking for a farm hand? I'll give you half of the flock. I won't deceive you. I don't want to help a thief. How am I a thief? Everything I took is ours. The landlord profits from our labor. You were thinking of yourself, not the people. Ismailbek has five thousand sheep. He alone has five wives. I don't even have one. I can't even feed my old mother and my little nephew. I am also a human being. How am I worse than the landlord? We used to have one thief in these lands - Ismailbek. Now we have two. Have you thought of your aul's fate? You'll destroy everyone. You are afraid of Ismailbek, but I am not afraid of him. I will never give up the flock. I see we have different paths in life. I am sad to lose a friend. Farewell. Apa, get ready, we need to leave. I can't understand why we are leaving at night and out of people's sight. You'll find out later, just hurry up for now. Did you think about the neighbors? They will start talking. Let them say whatever they want. We won't be here tomorrow morning. Allah, let our journey be safe and bless our new dwelling. Hurry. Look, look, Kokserek, you see, Kokserek. Kokserek, Kokserek, grab. Come on, Kokserek, grab. Kokserek. Kokserek. Kokserek. Grab, Kokserek. Take that. Kokserek. Kokserek. Grandmother. Kurmash. Kurmash. Hey Kurmash. What's this, what happened here? My arm hurts. What arm? I am asking about the sheep! Wake up, Kurmash. I... I am tired. - What happened? It was a dark night. Why did I leave you here? I fended off the wolves. And where is your Kokserek? I don't know. - Don't lie. I wasn't sleeping when the wolves entered the yurt last night. Kokserek was with me, he was always with me. A cowardly wolf pup. How many times did I tell you that he's no good? I should have killed him. But you pitied him. What's the use of him? - It's not his fault. And whose fault is it? So many dead sheep. I've spilled so much sweat for them. And you fed them to the wolves. Kurmash, get your things, we're leaving. Grandmother, grandmother. Greetings, my foal, hurry here, let me embrace you. My dear. Let me see how you've grown up. You're big boy now. Sit down, I'll pour you some tea. Drink. Why are you so tattered? What happened to you? The boy is tired, Apa. Let me him sleep. You'll question him later. Take more. - I can't, I want to sleep. Lay down, lay down. Let me cover you. The wolf won't become a dog. It's time to skin him. Kokserek, Kokserek. Here, have this. Kokserek, here. I am going to sort you out. Bitch. Not even a hiccup about the sheep or I'll rip your tongue out. As-salamu alaykum, landlord. So, did the stolen meat get stuck in your throat? Now we'll turn everything upside down. Polite guests say hello first. Who are you for me to be your guest? That requires honor, thieves get no greetings. They get spat on. - Did you catch me or something? I'll prove it to you right now. - I didn't steal anything. You didn't, you say? I'll poke your nose into it, animal. Found it! I found the meat. - Damn you all to the devil. I have no life because of you, bloodsuckers. Let go of me, let go of me. Let him go. Your hand. - Don't move. Tell us where the sheep are. Keep looking, you may get lucky. - Where did this meat come from? I exchanged it for my own skin, it's a gift from Hassen. Your resistance is futile. Tell me where the sheep are. - Listen, Ismailbek. Stop waggling that whip, all I have is this one horse and you know it. We've been tracking you for a while. You fled the aul. You thought to hide from in heavens? - My son. Mirza. Please spare him, he's all I've got, have pity on my old age. Get up, Apa. Apa, get up, immediately. Don't cry, your tears won't pacify him. In this world, he who is rich is right. - Get the old woman out of here. Let him go. - You better return the sheep yourself. And if you don't, I'll cripple you. Damn you, Ismailbek. May neither your children nor your grandchildren know happiness. Allah will punish you, bloodsuckers. For our suffering, for our tears, for everything, you rascals, everything. Why do you attack me like a wolf pack? Come out by yourself if you are not a coward. Let him go. If he is so eager to hold a match, let Allah see to who triumphs. Attack. Are you hurt, Mirza? - I am fine. And what should we do with him? Don't touch him, he got what he deserved. He's no longer a threat, leave everything to him. How could they do this to you, my son? - At least I am still alive. Where is Kurmash? He is hiding somewhere. Kurmash saw everything. He must know. He didn't say anything? - What could a child say, they didn't even hear me. Apa. I let them win on purpose. I still have the sheep. I tricked him after all. What sheep are you talking about? Where did we get sheep? I don't understand what you mean, son. - My leg hurts. Allah, help me understand. - My leg. Kurmash. Kurmash, where are you? Kurmash. Kurmash. Kokserek. Where are you going? Kokserek. Stop. Kokserek. Kokserek, Kokserek. Kokserek. Hello Kurmash. Go away. What's wrong with you, Kurmash? Why did you come here? I am Hassen, don't you recognize me? I won't let anyone in here. It's a sin to turn away out a guest. My conscience is clear before you. You are all liars. Who? - All adults. But you recognized me? - What do you want from me? Allow me to sit down at least. I've been watching you since morning. I've built myself a dwelling under this mountain. It's warm there, and close to a hot spring. No one but Allah could find it. Here it's winter, and there it's summer. The grass is green. I will not step away from this grave. Son, you won't survive here alone. I don't have anyone anyway. - You are not afraid of the graveyard? But this is the grave of my parents. Can't be, it's over a hundred year old. My parents died a long time ago. I understand. And where is Kokserek? - He ran away. It's all right, we'll find him together. - No, we won't find him. Why? - He doesn't want to live with people. It's all right, he'll come back. So Kurmash? Let's go to my place. If you don't like it, you'll leave. A grave is a grave. It's sinful to disturb those resting in peace. No. I am not going. Kurmash, you were always a smart boy. Fine, right now, it wouldn't hurt to get a boost of energy. Come here, you are probably also hungry. Take that. - I don't want it. You don't want meat? - I won't eat it. If you don't want it, that's your business. But you are hungry. I can tell by your eyes. Come, come, sit down. Don't be stubborn. Eat. Eat. Kurmash, Kurmash. Kurmash, come here quickly. I want to show you something. What is it, uncle Hassen? - Come here. I can't, I am not done grinding wheat. Come out to bathe in the spring. - No, I will freeze. You won't, it's warm here, come. - No. Kurmash. Too bad you didn't go, I caught a black fish. That will be our dinner. I caught a few more, but small ones, so I set them free. I see there is little left to do. So? Do you like it here? I like it, uncle Hassen. That's good. And you didn't want to come. A hearth can bring two orphans closer together. I also grew up without parents. There used to live an old wise man in these lands. He used to say, people light hearths together at dawn, but each passes his days in his own way. Some do good deeds, others do evil. But there must come a time when the poor can rejoice. I lived in the city. There was a railroad there, with metal carriages riding upon it. Who pulls these carriages? A horse or a camel? They ride on their own. - Is that possible? When the snow melts, we will go to the city, you'll see for yourself. He probably died. Who? My Kokserek. No, he's smart and sly and he also knows people's habits. Uncle Hassen, he is also an orphan, right? Come here. What? Just come. Look at how heavy the snowfall is. Long time ago, my mother used to say, When fluffy snow falls on water, the black fish are spawning. What's wrong? What's wrong with you? Don't cry, don't cry, Kurmash. No need for tears, don't cry, son. Spring will come soon. And we'll go to the city. I have many friends there, you'll play with their children. Don't cry. I won't leave you, don't cry, son. Did you come alone? Alone. Our boy is nowhere to be found? Nowhere. A child won't make it alone in these cold mountains. He ran away because of you. I've got nothing to be afraid of now. I am not guilty before him. Allah, spare our child, don't let him die. Where are you, my child? In this blizzard, they'll prowl anywhere. What are you talking about? The wolves. I saw a whole pack of them. Man does not frighten them. They got very close. To my luck, the horse saved me, I scared them away with a gun. I got scared. Allah must have helped me. Kokserek was there. I thought it was a werewolf. I should have skinned him when I had my chance. It's not him you should fear, sometimes man is more terrifying than wolf. If anyone is here, come out. It's the landlord's Kyrgyz men. - Don't go out, they'll kill you. They'll find me anyway, there is no escape from them. Is anyone there? Are you the owner? Yes, warden. Who is inside? Just my old mother. We're looking for an escaped criminal, explain to him. Surely know Hassen Kinzhitaev? It turns out he's a political prisoner, he escaped from prison. They say he is hiding somewhere in these lands. No, it's been a long time since I've seen Hassen. He hasn't visited me once. No one is there, your honor. If you see or hear anything about him, it's your duty to inform us, clear? Is that clear, you sheepish head? Yes. - That's all. Let's go. That's Kurmash screaming. No, it's the damn wind howling. Misery, if I only I could hear once more the voice of my foal. Come inside the yurt. - Thank you. Kurmash. Uncle Akhangul is here to take you. Kurmash, I finally found you. Sit down, Akhangul. How are you, Kurmash? I lost the hope of finding you. I saw Kokserek. Hassen. You remember Kurmash had a wolf pup? - I remember. He's become extremely ferocious. The most vicious one of the wolf pack. He attacks not just the cattle, but people too. Back then you said that... A wolf pup can be tamed. But you did everything to turn him into a wolf. You even wanted to raise the boy to be a wolf. Hassen. You are wrong. I wanted to make a man out of him. He who can defend himself can accomplish anything. Akhangul I believe that there is a grain of goodness in every human soul. Only it needs a chance to sprout. Drink. That is true. Only my grain... slipped past the millstone. So how can it grow? It died. My advice is to return the landlord's sheep. Take Kurmash and your mother and return to the aul. You'll share your joys and sorrows with everyone. You're good. You keep preaching goodness, talking of truth, but what about you? Tell me... Why were you imprisoned? You speak of honesty. There are soldiers are looking for you. Let them. I'll tell why I was in prison. We the people... Demanded bread for our work at the mines. They beat us with ramrods. I suffered because I did not want to be a slave. What is my crime? It's time to leave. Where did you find him? - At the grave of his parents. The cemetery? His parents are buried far away. - Not true, they are buried here. Isn't that so, Hassen? - It may be so. Get up, it's time to go. - I am not leaving. Kurmash, you're staying? I spent a lot of time looking for you. You know your grandmother will go blind from tears. And I have pain in my leg. It's hard for us. Kurmash, come back home. - I don't want to. Tell me why? - You'll beat me. No, no. I swear, I won't lay a finger on you. And if I touch you, may my hand fall off. Kurmash. We don't even have anyone to light the hearth at home. Your grandmother is very sick. What's wrong with grandmother. - She is in very poor health. If you don't come back, she will die from grieving. Let's go, Kurmash. Let's go. Hassen Aga? Decide for yourself. You taught me that I should help those in need. I will go. Good, you are right, you should go to your grandmother. Will you visit in the spring? - Of course. You'll be bored all alone. - It's all right, I am used to it. Good bye, Hassen Aga. - Good bye. Kurmash! Good bye! He's gone. Kokserek, Kokserek. Kokserek. Grandmother, grandmother! Kokserek came back! Where is his collar? Kokserek. Kokserek, come here. Kurmash. Kurmash. Kurmash. Akhan, where are you? Akhangul, what happened? Akhan? Who fired the shots? Why are you silent? Kurmash was screaming. He lost a lot of blood, poor kid. Allah, save my little foal. Such sorrow befell upon our home. For what sins are you punishing me? It's true what people say, a wolf pup brings misfortune. Save my little boy, Allah. Preserve the poor orphan's life. My eyes can't see anything. There was no joy in my life. Don't take away a grandson... from a miserable old woman. Take me instead. - I knew it would end this way. I told you that a wolf will never become a dog. It was you who confused the boy with your fables. And he believed you. One second, one second. One second, stay strong, my boy. Where should I look for this goodness? Allah made man a man. You can't rid of evil with more evil. Don't you understand? You are confusing man with wolf. I don't know. Maybe so. Help the boy, stay here. Hassen Kinzhitaev. Come out immediately. Else we'll shoot down everyone. Don't waste your bullets, I am coming out. Good bye. - What can we do without you? - Kurmash, good bye. Get well soon, we'll meet in springtime. What about Kurmash? My son. Good bye. Come back to us soon. I want to... take me outside. I want to see him one more time. Take him outside, Akhangul. Wait, stop! Stop. Hassen. Don't leave the child! He is so sick. Why are you taking a good man away? He never harmed anyone. Look at my old mother, she went blind from tears. Have pity on the child, wolves attacked him yesterday. Only Hassen can treat him. Let Hassen stay. If you want, I'll give you all my sheep. Are you humans or are you animals? Hassen, people, leave him here. There is no one to light the hearth in our home. He did not wrong anyone. Misery! Hassen! Don't leave the boy, he is so sick. Hassen! Stop!
