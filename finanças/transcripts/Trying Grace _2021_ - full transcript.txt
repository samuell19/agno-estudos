come out and tell me the truth why huh so you can judge me so you can tell me how wrong i am no so you can show me the way jessica you know i wouldn't do that really because this is starting to sound an awful lot like the last time i'll always be here for you baby whatever you decide it's fine with me you remember that jessica please no just good you know how i feel about that i don't i don't because the last time we talked about that you stormed out of the house look i'm sorry i was young i didn't know what to do i did what i thought was right but you said it was okay i said that to make you happy it wasn't okay with me you should have said something you don't blame me for not speaking up you you pushed me away i didn't know what to do you didn't try it was my son too i didn't want to walk away i was worried about our future i didn't want to throw away our future well you know what you made a selfish decision marcus and now it's time for me to make one i'm not telling you anything jessica come back jessica please is I can't believe they found another one you just keep fighting christina we'll take care of the rest god will take care of the rest that's right don't try to play god do you hear me i know i know we have a terrible history in this family of people trying to be god whenever life gets rough i remember what your father said to me right before he died he said don't worry about me god just misses me more than y'all ever could you just take care of my boy and now his boy is taking care of me how are we going to pay for this without the insurance well the church took up a donation and they knew we were in a tough spot and they knew how hard this was and they said they wanted to help look look see they sent me down here to put this towards the surgery look what they did for us justin that's so sweet but i don't i don't know if that's gonna be enough i i know well it's gonna happen every sunday they're gonna take up a donation and it's three different churches they asked what they could do and i was just honest and and i said this is hard and we really really need the money and that's what they did so god's blessing us baby justin do you think i'm gonna die they said it's gotten larger than the last time they saw it and i can't have people giving money if i'm just i'm just going to end up saying stop that don't even think like that god's not going to do that he's not going to take you away from me you're all i've got and said he's not going to leave me and your sister here by herself besides i can't handle her that's your job okay i needed that thank you me too me too baby well i'm gonna go lock up the church you get some rest okay you nervous yes but it has to be done god understands right he does he does just think about christina come on let's pray jesus we just ask that you're with us through all of this that you forgive our sin and you give us mercy for today in jesus name amen scott it's the pastor what the pastor he's the thief come on sir why would you say something like that i mean he's a pastor i'm serious jay why well why not his wife's sick he doesn't have the money he needs it so just because a man's wife is sick and he doesn't have money doesn't mean he's going to steal it besides he's a pastor i mean he's not alone in his circumstances the wall is full of them take a look around look how many bible studies did he have three months ago please would you listen to me how many bible studies did he have three months ago look two right two and how many did he have last month four and how many what days is he usually in the office monday tuesday thursday and friday but when was he in the office last month monday and thursday i want to bet that he Only has bible study twice this month so you think there's some sort of pattern to this there has to be michelle so you wanted to arrest the pastor right now off some suspicious hunts that could be a total joke well what do we have to lose our jobs i mean look i'm getting married next month i can't afford to get fired from this case i mean besides lisa's dad it's broke who's gonna pay for my wedding if i get fired scott come on we have one shot yeah one shot at finding a liable criminal look we can't play russian roulette with the pastor and end up losing i mean look this is ridiculous michelle hey would you trust me i've got a foolproof plan this is gonna work hey don't move give us some cash come on come on come on come on come on come on come on come on Come on is Yeah i still rep them never catch me switching probably changed where's the officer i money don't know what you're talking about well i'm talking about preaching now where's the money i have no idea what you're talking about we've been watching you for a long time we know you have it now i'm gonna ask you one more time where's the money what are you doing get out of this church get out god just please please come on let's go we're getting close real close preacher you're a different type of criminal but you're still a criminal we don't lock you up a lot of nerve bringing this young lady into this you're brave real brave but you better get out while you still can god don't let you get away gonna be another day scott hey what was that about what are you expecting you expected me to be nice to a criminal no one is a criminal unless proven guilty under a court of law you are being soft and you're being unreasonable are you coming or not hey michelle how are you not so good ah problem can uh somebody talk to me please scott what happened we were supposed to follow two potential suspects scott decided to chase him almost shot one of them i wasn't going to shoot her i just wanted to scare her brother you you should have never put a gun to that girl's head that was wrong i see where this is no okay can someone please bring me out of the dark here who did he point a gun at pastor thomas's sister-in-law pastor thomas chief go get y'all you know she don't play that right you seem to be okay with his actions no no no i actually wish i could have seen the look on the pastor's face he was shaking i bet he was what did you do So i walked up right and i pulled my dress man oh man tell me don't show me jeez look i hope the man gets what you deserve well we can't say that until we catch him and and prove him guilty right scott i'll make sure and do anything to see he does listen i'll be there to catch you anytime you mess that up again something or something let it out i'm thinking i need to be playing on the inside that doesn't sound like a good idea don't you think the pastor won't recognize as you that almost shot his sister i didn't almost you know what whatever well no matter what he'll notice you besides i need you here in this case yeah but we can't keep working the case from the outside i mean we need someone on the inside where the action is i need to be inside listen i get your point that we need someone in the church why don't we plant someone else you got someone else in mind oh i have the perfect person in mind come on follow me and to what do i owe this visit hey chief how's the family detective michelle i am not in the move for your exploratory questions i have a repeated robbery on my hands that none of you can seem to get a lead on And the two detectives plus one who had the best opportunity to nab these crooks are standing in my face so what could you two possibly have to say that i would be willing to hear nothing ma'am we have an idea we'd like to present to you more like an option so is this gonna be good i i don't think i love it so what is it well michelle levi here would like to go undercover at the church to uh gain some intel wait what i'll never yes yes i do detective levi if this is your way of getting more days off it's about to happen no no no chief i don't want any days off this was all michelle's idea really michelle when did you come up with this idea for weeks yes michelle brought this to us weeks ago weeks there's just there's a lot of information that we have that points to the pastor detective michelle i don't know what you have up your sleeve but i can't run the risk of you any of you being found out but i want all the details of this operation don't leave any holes detective no ma'am we won't all right all right get out of here oh and michelle you know the worst part of the night shift what's that chief your ideas now aaron are we going to make budget with all this expansion that we need the way we've been growing we know we need a new nursery we're just at capacity and we can't hold them anymore yes giving is up currently we are 85 of our budget pastor i don't know how you do it but these people love you probably more so your wife i think definitely more so my wife well let's just keep building on our end for sure so tiffany give us an update on the media well for starters the switchboard is about to call it quits it's two cameras not working and that sound board is archaic okay well thank you for being so positive i'm just being honest just stating the facts okay that's true but what are we going to do about it well i asked aaron for some funds and she was saying that it's not in the budget it's not in the budget is there any wiggle room in this budget honestly pastor no we've used all of our excess on that nursery project well maybe we can fund that project with the excess overflow for this project i mean but the only problem with that would be we'll be waiting because waiting would mean that we wouldn't be able to livestream services for at least two to three weeks and that's a good point so what are we gonna do we're going to trust god that he's always provided for me he's always provided for my wife and he's always provided for my family and i know if he's done it for us he's going to do it for the church too amen amen amen all right now i want to introduce you ladies to somebody mr levi mr levi is a carpenter by trade and a handyman of source isn't that right mr levi yes that's correct my father owned a carpentry shop and on the side he taught a lot of handyman stuff and that's perfect because we know we need that around here so feel free spruce up what you see any area that you know needs a little bit of extra love and tender care please do so whatever is in your capabilities honestly and ladies i want to ask you this whatever he needs make sure we have his back okay okay oh pastor by the way a detective scott stopped by the church the other day he said he had some information he wanted me to pass on to the congregation okay go ahead well there have been some robberies in the city and the police department is working really hard to try to figure this thing out detective scott said the last robbery happened closer to our neighborhood and he just wanted us to know so that we wouldn't be here so late well they haven't robbed any people have they i thought it was just businesses well that's true and i mentioned it to him but detective scott said that in situations like this you can never be too careful people get desperate so we don't know what might happen well we'll certainly pass that along to the church this sunday but i wanted y'all to meet mr levi so thank you so much for all you're doing seriously it means a lot pastor how's your wife doing did she ever get the gifts we sent she got the flowers the balloons and the candy for sure so she says thank you so much and jess too she wants to thank you all for your generosity it really means the world well we sure glad we could make her smile because we pray for every day yes your wife is a christian woman and we know she believes in the power of prayer yes yes she does she is a strong woman of faith for sure well pastor are you sure that she doesn't want any company i mean i would like to get up there to see you because i know it gets pretty lonely up there yeah well honestly she's not by herself a lot so half of the day she has tests and all that kind of stuff and then when jess gets out of class she goes up there to be with her and then when i get off work we kind of switch off so she's honestly not alone a lot by any means and listen she really just doesn't want you all to see her like this so as soon as she allows visitors y'all will be the first to know i promise okay okay pastor well let's pray and let me get you all out of here to your families lord we thank you so much for all you're doing in and through our church we ask that you forgive our sins and that you give us new mercies every day in jesus name amen amen ladies have a good night good night good night pastor hey i'm sorry oh my goodness uh just one more thing what's going on man aaron said uh the guy or the detective's name was scott right i think that's right did you hear something different no no i was just wondering so that i could remember to call his name if i see him here while i'm working oh man honestly i love that great idea uh also basser you think they'll catch him oh you know before he or she or whoever it is like hurt someone let's be prayerful and hope so you're right have a good night you too levi lord if there is any other way hey doc okay so we received the test results and it doesn't look good we found another brain tumor another one can we remove it safely without damaging anything yes i believe so i believe so the surgery doesn't have to be done today but definitely soon as you know your insurance won't cover another surgery like this has the church been able to raise any more money pastor thomas some some we we've been able to get some and we'll have what we need by the time of the surgery okay good good good there's still time it doesn't have to be done today but definitely soon good luck thank you looks like somebody's had a demotion from detective to the help thanks dad good i'm glad that worked out come on he'll be back sir right right um he said he needed to take his wife to therapy and then um he was going to take a donation down to the hospital bingo no no bingo not yet innocent until proven well whatever whatever what's up i'm starting to think some of the members of the church are catching on to a few things like what well for one how many new members just jump right in and start fixing things these are things that have been wrong with this church for a while now you don't think it's weird that i'm just so willing to help out secondly i don't think these people are stupid i don't know how much longer we can keep this up well good the quicker we can get the information the quicker we can arrest the truth and put them in jail right well the last time i was here pastor and i were the last to leave now he sat in the same spot where he always sits only this time he seemed to be more protective of that area if he stood up he stood up right here in front of the podium and if he moved he moved from either one side of the other as if he was trying to protect something something he may have forgot to remove when before the people got here so you think he's hiding here but it's a bench let's open it hold on why well because i don't want to be wrong what if we open that there's nothing inside or what if he knows about us and he's been watching us or what if he knows about levi and it's a setup we don't even know what he's doing with the money who cares he's the criminal not us wait wait what has gotten into you it's like you've changed dude what look you're taking this way too personal what did he do to you huh it's something you're not telling me you need to stick to your job no you got something against this man don't you stay out of my business your business this this entire case is our business we robbed my family store what yeah walked right in and held him up at gunpoint when last night you know with all the robberies going on i typically stop by my brother's stop help him close it down last night they told me i had to leave i told him i'd stay they insisted that i leave so i left look scott you cannot take this personal okay think what will happen if you take matters into your own hands hey listen we have a duty to arrest them bring them in that's it we do our jobs and we let god in the courts do theirs levi you laughed at me when i told you i pointed a gun at his sister please listen to me you should have thought about that before you laughed look you two have got to go he's probably on his way back for bible study i ain't going nowhere i'm staying right here listen to me you're gonna blow this entire thing ruin all of our hard work let the court try him first think about your family uh detectives i see you've met her a crown jewel mr levi yes sir pastor uh we just met actually they got here not too long after you left and they were asking me about the robberies oh has there been more yes one earlier this week even closer to the church yeah they've been very very close to home base it's more like a rookie mistake well mr levi we'll just be sure to make sure we lock everything up and secure the grounds definitely so uh detectives is there anything else as a matter of fact no sir we'll be on our way no rush on our part we've got bible studies starting in just a little bit and y'all are more than welcome to join us sorry to disappoint you i've got other engagements detective michelle actually i i am interested what time does it start in about an hour or so great i'll see you then all right one more verse before we get out of here tonight matthew 6 33 real quick real quick it's familiar to all of us but i want to make it real in our hearts today the words of jesus he says but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things will be added unto you i love this for a few different reasons because number one he says seek ye first the kingdom of god put your eyes on him just as he did with peter when peter steps out of the boat when peter locks eyes with jesus everything is okay and we have to remember that for our heart as well and then he says all these things will be added un to you all things not a few things not certain things not not some distant things all things amen i want you guys to know this and put it to practice that god is able he will provide in every area of your life amen all right here we go before we get out of here before we get out of here i want to do one quick thing i want to draw attention to one of our neighborhood's greatest assets she's been sworn to protect and serve and she has certainly done that church will you just show the love to detective michelle please hey actually detective michelle come here come here come on up here come on up yeah come on come on come on come on come on we're family here come on uh you have anything you want to say oh no Uh i'm a person of very very few words uh i just like to take action and do my job so y'all have a good night no no excuse me Detective um we like to finish each bible study with a little bit of song before we go to the house oh would you like to do the honors no i don't think your congregation wants to hear that come on detective come on we listen to pastor every night you can't be no worse than him my goodness uh what should i sing hey whatever is on your heart help me lord i'm here again wondering are you there they tell me to trust your word and that i can't be scared and lord help me to be faithful and help me to be sure that you will be able to get me off this floor i know that you've provided time and time before but my confidence subsided and i'm calling out once more and there is a place where you can hide when the world seems to crush you and there's nothing left inside and there is a voice calling out to you saying lay down your burdens with me you can't lose and he's offering grace he's offering grace he's offering grace let's pray let's get out of here jesus thank you so much that you gave us your promise of grace that you've given us your promise that if we seek you you will supply all of our needs jesus we ask you tonight forgive us of any sins that might be in our heart that should not be there and we ask for new mercies every day in jesus mighty name everybody said amen amen and amen hey let's get out of here yo have a good night drive safe drive safe y'all be careful y'all be careful you always will have a good one have a good one so levi what's going on brother everything okay i just noticed something wrong with this bench here oh well uh by all means let's take a look at it mr levi can i tell you something a few things actually sure go ahead i'm all ears you know my wife is dying she had a brain tumor and they really feel like they were able to take care of it But now we just got another report saying there's another one and they think this one could be cancerous yeah you know my wife and her sister that's all i've got i literally have no other family they're all gone then we keep hearing this from the insurance company that they've worked with us as long as they can and the doctors won't do anything until we Get either the cash shop or a new insurance which is impossible so we sit there in that doctor's office and as i looked as we're getting the news and the doctors saying there's literally nothing they can do they won't even cover a test i watched this tears stream down my wife's face and i watched him stream down jessica's face and i sat there and did the thing that any good husband and any good brother would do I took things into my own hands and i started stealing the money and i've almost got enough to not just cover the test but to cover the whole thing well you know man jessica she's so hardheaded sometimes and she kept asking all these questions about it what she could do to help and what am i doing to help and i just couldn't lie to her and i told her and then of course she wanted to help and she would always say let me do something to save my sister's life but i i just i couldn't i couldn't do that because listen i know the danger that i'm putting myself in every time i have to do that and i couldn't even thank to put her in that situation she insisted eventually i just i gave in we did it we did it together we'd bring the money here to the church hide it right here until we could safely get it back to my house and somehow get it Into our savings account without causing all these red flags and alarms we didn't want to go through national bank we went through a local bank just trying to Cover our tracks because it wasn't about being doing the crime or being criminals there's nothing about that it it's about saving my wife's life for her saving her sister's life that's what it all comes down to you know mr levi i really hope all of this isn't in vain we've worked so hard for this we've just prayed and asked god to show my wife mercy and you know for me i've preached it a lot god always gets his man and i'm hoping i don't know i'm just hoping he'll make some unusual pardon for me and for once just once he doesn't because after all to save life my wife's life wow uh i don't know what to say i'll tell you what say your secret's safe with me your secret safe with me thank you mr levi it sure doesn't mean a lot pastor thomas yeah why did you tell me that levi you'd be surprised how much weight secrets carry brother i've carried that one for a long time and it almost crushed me let me ask you you have any secrets like that well um yeah yeah i do well let's hear it it can't be any worse than what i just told you come on okay i've never been a handyman this man you sure fooled me oh i did hey look that's uh i gotta get out of here gotta go pick up dinner the lady's coming over to fix dinner yes sir hot little date huh sir look it's been so long i hope i still know how to be polite i'm sure you do yeah i'm sure you do thanks again man i really appreciate you letting me just get that off my chest uh pastor thomas yeah why did you really tell me that levi because even if that's true they wouldn't believe it coming from you now you're absolutely correct about that good night man have a good night hey you you and justin you two of the thieves you doing here he's following me just why did you tell me why did you tell me you couldn't handle it jessica you can't steal from people and expect yourself to to just fix your situation it's wrong oh that's easy for you to say my sister she is dying she needs this money just what i do know is that this is wrong how do you think those families gonna feel when they find out that you've been stealing from them jessica how would your sister feel first of all the people that we steal money from they have more than enough they will do fine without a few dollars here and there second of all my sister is in the hospital and she is dying i think it'll make her happy to know that we would do anything to save her life i'm telling her what the two of you are doing good i'm glad you finally want to be a man i'm glad you finally want to tell the truth why don't you start with telling her how you got me pregnant at a party one night yeah why don't you tell her that what you actually did was rape because i was drunk then won't you tell her how you convinced me to kill her nephew her only nephew start with that marcus see we all struggle with something marcus the question is do you have the guts to expose it i don't think you do marcus do you no you don't so why don't you just do what you do tuck your tail and run get out of here jessica this has to stop before i get worse i gotta save my sister markets i got it i don't have anybody else if anybody they're all dead it's just me and my sister marcus she is all i got i can't i can't be without her look jessica i know you don't want to hear this but your sister's in god's hands now so what am i supposed to do am i just supposed to let no watch my sister die am i just supposed to take this money give it back i can't do that jessica this has to stop it's wrong god you weren't saying that that's great what is he doing here jessica what is he doing here what is he doing here he he followed me i didn't bring him i promise jessica did you two no listen he he didn't mean any harm he he just she look she's telling the truth she didn't tell me anything but i do know what's going on here jessica go home go home it's all right just leave us two here so what are you gonna do are you here to turn this in no sir i was hoping you would do that yourself you're hoping i would do that this is real man there's not any hidden cameras there's no surprises this is a real gun that's real money and you're messing with the real man let me ask you some demarcus you ever lost anybody that you loved of course i'm not talking about some distant relative that you barely knew and saw every once in a while i'm talking about somebody you laughed with somebody you cried with somebody you spent your life with have you ever lost a family member like that yes and how did that make you feel i was upset hurt i didn't know what to do well you know what pastor that hurt it was going to bring them back see i don't expect you to understand everything that i'm going through i'm losing my wife and that very pain that you're talking about i don't want to experience because marcus there is a fine line between misery and pain and that includes their lives jessica could spend the rest of her life in prison do you not care i got a question for you pastor when you stand before god and he asked you why did you let jessica help you steal and rob from people just to save a life what will you say i'll look back at him in his face and say lord you'll have to ask her no christina thomas you have some company okay sentiment i don't i don't know them christina thomas this is detective michelle and detective levi they have a few questions that they want to discuss with you i'll be right outside thank you hello christina how are you i'm okay how are you i'm fine fine thanks look christina i'm just gonna get straight to the point i know your rest is really important right now but we know that your husband has been stealing money and using it to pay for your surgery coming up and the easiest way for us to just wait excuse me now's not the time to play dumb we know the entire story we heard an outright confession from your husband excuse me no my husband would never do anything like this would be doing your family a favor if you would just tell the truth we could end this investigation and put a criminal behind bars what about the families that he's robbing to save you what about the fear that he's putting in the hearts of innocent people hey my husband wouldn't do anything like this okay he's the pastor of our church he's a dedicated servant to our community he holds up countless donations to help people in need he would never do anything like this if he was so dedicated to doing what's right then why wouldn't he go to the church to help his family he did i was admitted here two years ago for a brain tumor and at the time i was working full time and so was my husband so we had insurance to cover the surgery then last year my father died my husband then took over as lead pastor of our church after that i had to go back to the doctor for headaches and seizures we no longer had the insurance okay my husband was just working at the church and i got laid off so the idea came up to get the church to help its donations of course i didn't want him to take it to the church i was embarrassed i felt responsible but my husband is a loving and trusting man and he insisted that we allow the church to help us and after a long conversation i i did i let him take it to the church and he said that they were doing multiple donations for this to pay for the surgery so you clearly have the wrong man my husband would never do anything like this i don't believe it his faith is way too strong for that christina there's something we need to tell you the past couple of months detective levi has been undercover at your husband's church disguised as a handyman while his main focus was to infiltrate the congregation and and figure out what the pastor was up to we couldn't do anything unless we had hard evidence and the other night detective levi and your husband they were at the church alone and he told him everything i know where the money's being hidden as well as the motive christina i know this is a really hard time for you but we have to bring your husband and your sister to justice it's just not fair for the many people whose lives have been threatened what what we need from you is an affidavit saying that you were the recipient of the money the story that he told as well as the motive behind his decision i know this is very hard but we have to bring this to an end will you help us in this get out what i said get out christina think about this this isn't right please just go you know how difficult it is to break into this church who are you and how did you get in here i walked in the back door pastor daniels what are you doing here i'm trying to save you and your brother-in-law's lives joe get out of here man before you get yourself hurt or killed jt what are you doing i'm trying to save her life what does it look like i'm doing and how long do you think you can keep this up before the police figured it out just long enough till we get all the money that's it and then we'll be done what do you want joe i want you to stop i think you know the answer to that let's go just what are you doing i've already told you so why don't you say what you're gonna say so i can get back to jessica because man we've got work to do you know what the scripture said come on man really you know what go ahead amuse me with that please scripture says that when you have a grievance with your brother you're to go to him first so i'm here to see if we can reach some kind of common ground do you think that included or excluded a pastor who's trying to save his dying wife jt trust god trust that he knows what he's doing he's brought you shut up okay god understands this he doesn't want this to happen he wants us to grow together and have a family together you don't understand this man j.t i've been there i've seen what love and passion can drive a person to do listen you don't know there's pain i've lost my wife what us i said i said i've lost my wife before i moved here a couple years ago she had cancer doctors gave her about six months to live i couldn't deal with that i knew there had to be some way to make her live longer i had the same thoughts you do stealing doing whatever i can to save her life but i realized something me rob and stealing doing whatever had nothing to do with saving her life but it had everything to do with making sure that someone else hurt as much as i hurt i covered up that feeling of saving her life but i didn't go through with it you know why the lord spoke to me clearly and said everyone will bear their own cross in their own appointed time this this is your time don't allow your testimony to get lost in your test stay faithful so i i kept giving i kept smiling i kept on praying and she died just like that she died but jt god had me god carried me not because i deserved it because i had been in pain we all had pain though he carried me because i stayed faithful stay faithful j.t stay faithful give me the god i can't do that all right leave me no

which i will be asking questions reviewing evidence and giving the ultimate decision for this case yes your honor also the detectives who had been granted a search warrant are here and will provide testimony and evidence that is crucial to this case they are accompanied by a lawyer that was appointed by the state furthermore the request to represent yourself in this case has been granted with all these things being understood are you prepared to move forward in this case yes your honor in the case of justin thomas versus state how do you plead not guilty counselor you may present your evidence your honor in my hand i hold the medical bills for him as christina thomas from three years ago when doctors found a brain tumor and due to the coverage of the family's health insurance the surgery took place and the tumor was removed and in this hand i hold current health care records stating that due to the inability of the family to keep up with their current health care payments second tumor that was found was unable to be removed your honor this is an affidavit from the saint vincent's accounting department stating that large sums of payments and cash were received by the hospital from the hand of mr thomas over the past few weeks in order to pay for the needed surgery lastly here's a recording of mr thomas openly confessing his wrongdoing he lied to me i was just trying to save my wife's life don't you understand that i was just trying to save her life her family can't live without you her my brother for life because of you we had to sell the family business that my grandfather started you can't take from one to give to another we're in this room no matter how you try to dress it up and make a new name it's still wrong you may not have been hurt anybody but you did you did pastor ordering the court order counselor do you have a closing argument yes your honor i do but before i do let me first say that the only reason i am reading this is at the request of the what does that senate mean hello if you are reading this letter then the case is already underway let me first begin by saying i love my husband and my sister i always have and i always will i'm writing this letter because i was approached by the detectives present and asked to submit an affidavit concerning the receipt of large sums of money for my surgery for my husband and my sister justin thomas and jessica williams and i was under the impression that it was donations from the church that he had collected while under this assumption i freely accepted the money and asked my husband to thank the church every time he came with another donation i know that my family was wrong but they were trying to save a life my life haven't we all done things to save one that caused the pain of another even if it was telling a small lie it still hurt somebody but just like this case that doesn't make it right to my husband i know that you love me and you know that i love you i know that you were doing this to save me and by god i hope it works i know that you are going to be put away for a long time and i pray that god will allow me to see you one more time before i have to say goodbye to my sister jessica i knew you wanted to see your big sister happy and after you have served your sentence i pray that god will allow me to see your smile one more time i love you both thank you for your efforts now everything is as it should have been from the beginning in god's hands keep praying for me as i will you i love you both goodbye mr thomas is there anything you would like to say no i hereby sentence you to three years in prison you will be eligible for parole after one year of good conduct i apologize for interrupting who are you i'm christina thomas's doctor i have a piece of information from mr thomas i'm so sorry mr thomas no mrs thomas passed away a few moments ago i'm so very sorry ma'am i regret to inform you that your sister has passed away no tell me is that true no please no god no among other things god is a god of order and justice we can't go through life trying to save the ones we love by hurting people we don't know god always has a way of getting his man or woman one thing that i learned is that we have to be willing to submit our lives to his will regardless of the outcome we would prefer always remember that we have to be willing to trust god no matter what we think we have to know that what he deems as being the best outcome is the right outcome i had to learn that although my wife was important to me everybody is important to somebody even as christians we have to suffer the consequences of our actions our punishment from god is always far worse than anything man can decide we can't let revenge take over our minds always remember that when you go to take from someone else because of what was taken from you you only take yourself away from those who love you i hope that my testimony has touched you in some way take care of yourselves and i feel like a mannequin when i'm battling demons hounding like savages i'm low low below the averages i'm supposed to be a catalyst for change rearranging things but all this pain got my weapon aimed at my own brain this word she might get curved all that commitment for the bird
