You are the nicest person in the world. Can you help me with this? Thi is my family's Dog Fist style. Teacher! I can't do it but my sister can! I rely on you! Sister! You are back at last? This water duck. Doesn't look like a duck at all? They are mandarin ducks you idiot. I know nothing about them, But I do know who this is for. Who is it for?

Then why was he with the Japanese pirates? Stop hitting him. You better explain to my sister. If you want her to teach you. Tell her! My name is... Wuwechmatao. What are you doing in China? Wuwechi Sang, finaly we meet! What can I do for you? I heard all the Japanese martial artists except you. Today I meet my greatest challenge! I am sorry. Martial arts are for improving one's health not for fighting. Excuse me! You don't want to fight me? That's okay. You can get out of town by crawling between my legs. This is Japanese territory. How dare you cause trouble here! Come on! I'm the best fighter in the world. All fighters bow in front of me. You can't be an exception! Hit him! Stand up! It would be easier for you to crawl between my legs. Instead of wasting so much time and energy! Crawl! So do you want to crawl now? Or do you want some more convincing? Stop! Buddha bless you! Hari Kiri is a brave act. But it is still blood that is shed. I've been humiliated by a foreigner. That is great shame. I know. But only the strongest survive. You can always find success from failures. Please explain sir. I come from China, I have a manuscript. Which recalls some styles from Shaolin Temple. If you want to learn this style you must go to China. If you want to learn this style you must go to China. China! No missions are impossible. And no roads are too hard. China! So that's why you're here. I got on the wrong boat. That's why I was with those pirates. Help him and reach him the style! I can't violate our family rule! That you're teaching Tien Peng! No you can't! So you agree? Great your teacher! It's not so easy to learn the style. You may not be able to do it. No missions are impossible. I'll do anything to learn! So you'd rather die than crawly through foreigner's legs. What if I want you to crawly through my legs. You are belong tough to him. What do you know? I'll do it! A man's crawled through sister's leg. You have a teacher now, bow to your teacher. Teacher! I didn't mean to humiliate you. Because your crawled legs is one of this style specialties. Will you forgive me! I must thank you! Japanese pirate! He's good men! He killed my father. Why did you let him crawl through your legs? Don't hit him, he's a good man. Leave now, go away from here! Never let anyone find you! The pirates are killing innocent people, So the Chinese hare us, I can't go anywhere. No missions are impossible. I got it! What's that man doing in the water? This is the fish time I had sushi since I left home. He's eating live fish! Is he a wild man? I think he's mad. Watch me! What are you doing? He is still wearing a loin cloth. Give me back my clothes! Mom says only Japanese wear long clothes. We found a Japanese pirate! Give me back my clothes! Wait, give them back! Stay where you are! Come back! Come back here! Forgive me Buddha! My lord! Well? We shall succeed this time, We'll sneak into the city on the Tin Hau festival. And steal the pearl from Tin Hau's crown, and we'll be rich. The pearl? That's a priceless jewel! Really? Come out! You won't get away, come out now! You betrayed me! No, maybe they followed you, kill the witnesss! You pirate, I know you are hiding in there, Come out of there! Ghost! You are the ghost, He killed your father! What are you talking about? You are all a buch or murderers. Watch out! We must eliminate Wuwechimatao for our own good, Stop! What are you doing? I have to avenge father! Japanese pirate! Arrest him! Move! I've caught a Japanese pirate... It's time for you to get revenge, do what you want with him! Kill him! Kill him! Uncle! Don't hit him, he's a good Japanese! He's not your uncle, take him away! He's a good Japanese, please don't kill him! Please don't kill him! Wuwechimatao is a cold blooded murderer. He sneaked into city to get information It's fortunate that I've caught him. Or the city would become a blood bath. The pirates killed my whole family, kill him! Time's up, kill him. Hold it! Don't kill him! Move aside! Hong Tian Peng, you want to stop an execution. This man killed my father sir. I must avenge father! He killed your father? It's too easy for him to die like this! So what do you want to do? Can you give him to me sir? I want to torture him till he dies, to appease my father's spirit. Alright, I'll grant you your wish. Thank you sir! Stang up, let's go! Wait! I'll come with you, I want to see how he dies. So he'll be an example to all pirates. Let's move! What are you waiting for? How are you going to kill him? I want him to suffocate and die slowly Cover it! Cheers! It was clever of you to get someone else to kill him. Wuwechimatao is dead, we can relax now. The pearl in Tin Hau's crown is really priceless? Yes, that belonged to the Sung emperor. How do we get into the city. We use this. I'll meet you at the Eastern Gate on the day of the festival. We're shorter than Chinese. They'll spot us easily if we're together. I'm prepared for that, look! You are clever! A toast to pearl! A toast to Wuwechiamtao's death! Cheers! Tian Peng is rotten boy! Uncle... Wuwechimatao! Uncle! Are you alright? I'll withstand and suffering if I could learn Chinese Kungfu. I shouldn't have blamed Tian Peng. He left breathing holes in the coffin. He's not so bad after all. You use your legs a lot in this style. So this is sister's idea. Thank you, teacher! Your real teacher is there. You two are trying to make me violate our rules? Greet teacher! Teacher! Listen to me mother! You unfilled son. You haven't married her yet you do everything she says. You make a mistake, he is good man. But he killed your father. You must be crazy. Listen to me. What should we do? Go to master Wisdom at Shaolin. Stop! You want to let the murderer go, I'll avenge my husband. But he is a good man I'll kill anyone who tries to stop me! Don't be like this! How could you treat my daughter like this! Get out of my way or I'll kill you. Go ahead! Get away! Leave! I'll break your leg. Go! Get out of here! I won't, I want to learn Chinese Kungfu. We are close to Shaolin Temple now. Stand where you are you pirate. Mother! Stop! Hold it! Listen to me, I was him who saved me and Cui Gu the other day. Calm down. If it weren't for him, I would have died a long ago. You are like a flea in a cheap inn, You just bit anyone you see. Alright. It's all my fault. Don't be so fierce, Apologize to him. Or he'll think Chinese are all uncouth. Alright I will! The gods will always help the righteous to destroy evil. I shall go and eliminate these pirates. And restore peace to the land. Please give me your blessings Buddha. Buddha bless you! There is master Wisdom. Come on! Master wisdom. Cui Gu! This must be the Japanese samurai. Yes, I'm Wuwechimatao, sir. Please! The pirates have a Chinese helping them, They are going to plunder the city during the Tin Hau festival. Wuwechimatao gave me the information. Buddha bless you. You are Japanese yet you help our people. You have my respect sir. In order to clear the shame heaped on me. I beg you to teach me Shaolin Kungfu! Can bear what other's can't, you will reach what others can't. In my opinion you have succeeded. Master! Please stand up! I need to know he enemy before I fight them. Why you teach me the Japanese martial arts sir? The Japanese martial arts originated from China. I'm happy to tell you what I know. If fight the Shaolin leg style from the Mengchi's hand, is very powerful. Good! Right! Go! Japanese martial acts originated from China but his message is learn from me Thank you teacher! What's he going to do? We call this judo, I'm sorry! Alright if your mind is pure, there is nothing to be afraid of! You are embracing a Japanese in public, and you say that's alright? Tian Peng, you must stop them. I'm observing the Japanese style! Your wife to be is with another man, and you just stand here watching. What are you doing? I want to learn the Japanese style! Tian Peng be careful! Tian Peng, you're learning Japanese style. So why'd you hit him with the Tiger's Fist? If I didn't use that. How could he learn Chinese Kungfu. Please teacher me. Watch out you can't touch a tiger's rear! No you can't, this is the Tiger's tall! Thank you. I wanted you to teach him a lesson. Why did you teach him our family style? We mustn't limit our knowledge, by national boundaries Prejudice like that is pure idiocy! That's true, that's why I'm still a bachelor, and you are now a widow. Then you'll let Cui Gu marry Tian Peng We'll discuss this after we drive the pirates out. You are the god are also the ghost. Look, here comes Tin Hau! She's beautiful! The pirates are here, run! You won't get away this time! Who are you? A ghost catcher! This is a trap, retreat! No, I must get the pearl! Is me. I've got the crown, get us out of here! We've been cheated! What! The crown is take, the real one is still in the temple. Damn! Right over there. The crown is in the main hall. I'll keep watch for you outside. Quick! Is that real one? I'm sure! Shaolin warrior monks. That traitor! This is an ambush! We must get the pearl, kill them. Kill them! Let me see who you are? So it's you! You are asking or trouble! Xu San... Are you a man or a ghost? You have sinned you can't stay in the human world! Look! You are still alive. You are doomed. Today you're going to die. Kill them! What style is that? The Chinese Shaolin Sword style. How did like the Tiger's tail? You are a Japanese too. Why'd you go against your own people? You are a shame to all Japanese. Your bleed will only soil my sword. Why don't you do it yourself! Wuwechimatao! Drop your sword or she's dead! What do you want? Just watch! What do you want with her? Give me the pearl if you want her to live, and give us a boat to leave here? No way! You want her to live, then cut your arms off. Come on you've lost. Do it now! My lord... Kill him! Quick... You'll have to die with me. Don't be scared, I'm here with you! Let's go! You will die with me! Uncle! Are you alright? You saved my life again. Thank you! Thank you for helping me again. A man must have broad shoulders. A woman is allowed to love more than one man, You can ask your mother! You are not married, you are not qualified to talk about women. Young woman always falls for a man like Wuwechimatao. Tian Peng is the better husband. I feel the same way too. Cui Gu is going to marry Tian Peng. Enough talking!
