* REVERENDING COLT * "You loafer!"!. What did you say? That's enough! It was time for you to mature. Son of a whore!... That was not nice of you. Oh no? Not!... Sheriff, Sheriff, do you need help? They look dangerous! The only dangerous thing here is you! Now go back to the office while on patrol. And so? This is it! Hey, Mat! Poker is not played with five aces. Send it to the street now, before there is a disgrace... send this guy out to the street before he gets me wrong Damn, he really has five aces! Five aces! Out and don't come back!... "10,000 FOR THE HALE BREED" Hey, good morning. You can take care of my horse. Certainly, sir. A double, fast. Double? What is it Joe, the devil is chasing you? Yes, it is someone. I just saw Miller Colt. Ah!... Miller Colt, the bounty hunter. Hyah, hyah!... "Whatever..." "Good morning, Donovan". Hell, they all said you were dead, Miller! I've never been more alive, Sheriff. Damn Miller, I told you to leave town and never come back! I'm starting to feel badly received. Do you want, a reception committee? You can stay here. But I warn you, Miller! But if it causes the slightest problem, I'll put you in jail... I've been holding you for 20 years, with bread and water! Stay calm. I am now a priest, not a bounty hunter. 10,000 dollars. Nowadays, you pay more. And you say you gave up being, a bounty hunter? Hun!... Yes, I am now a servant of God. I will build a church here. Are you now in that priestly outfit? And how will you build this church? With your cartridge boxes? I need something more than that. I wonder if you would like to give me about 200, Donovan. That's all it takes to build it. Is that all, building a church? What a pleasant surprise, dear. But you look beautiful! But calm down. What to be? Whiskey, double? A glass of water! Water!... Sorry, I don't have any more water. But I can offer you a beer. It doesn't matter, but thanks. "Are you going to stay, long?" Yes, I think I'll stay here for a while. Do you have a free room? Yes of course. Most are empty. Choose what you want. Thanks. Hey, Miller! Miller, ah! Miller! Hello, Margie. Ah!... Save Miller, tell me about these strange clothes. It is something serious. It means I'm going to call you "Father Miller" now. I'ts right. Now my name is Father Miller. But what happened. I can believe you are no longer, a bounty hunter. No, no. You mean you are really a priest? Yes, I'm a priest. Why? Now it's my profession, until I change my mind. Maybe one day I'll explain, Margaret. Of course, that will not change anything. We can still be friends. Of course, we can be friends. Thanks!... Who is that important guy? Miller Colt. Mo... Miller Colt... the famous bounty hunter No, I didn't hear. Okay, you didn't hear. You never hear anything. Can this cause us problems now? Unlike Timo, on the contrary... I would say he arrived, just in time. Let's go to Circle Wise. I ran out of supplies. Okay, Don. Hya, hya!... Hey, Pablo!... Let's go! Bang, bang, beng, bang... Come on, son, drink this. Do you want anything else? Ah!... If her mother was still alive, she would know what to do. Oh, can we get in? Reverend, we need beds, food and drink. The table is set, friends. You are welcome. Feel free. He is my son. She is not feeling well. And now? Let's go. Sit down! Where will you go? Ah!... Dad! Dad! You will pay for it! It was him, he was... He is the killer!... What's up? You killed him!... Pue what's going on? Let me through! Make room, silence. Let me through, damn it! Silence Create space! This one is Miller Colt! He did that! This pig killed Sam! Fuck! Do you feel like playing? Let's go! Sheriff, he's the killer, Miller Colt. What other proof do you want? What are we waiting for? We will hang him! Damn it, I told you to calm down! Jump! Put him in jail! Here you will be safer!... You will be safe inside. If they try to get in, shoot without fear. Don't worry, Sheriff. A bullet will flee like frightened goats. Come on!... Is this book interesting? It's the Bible. The chapter on the promised land. Isn't it like a prison here? Why not? The promised kingdom is where we want to find it. When do you think the Sheriff will be back? Once you report to the City Council, it won't be long. "She won't waste any time, believe me". Right. Let's go in and get him out of there! It's getting difficult here!... No lynching has occurred here in this city! At least so far. Yes I know!... Whatever happens, that will be God's will. If you really are a priest, start praying. Hey!... Johny... Johny... Oh, my son!... Freddy! Now! Freddy! Now! But these guys are not leaving It seems that they want to do justice "Come back, or you will get a bullet"! It's me, Hop! Why did you tame it, open the door? Hello, be with the Lord. Open the door, damn it! Gentlemen... Come on, tell him, mayor. Outside people believe you are lying and that he is not a priest, as you say. But gentlemen! Framing a pastor? Sure, we're going to have to keep you locked up, Mr. Miller. Understand, you think I'm a priest... to support you at this moment I understand...? You were closer to poor Sam when he was killed I can't blame myself!... Hmm!... It doesn't mean you can kill him, Miller. Time to blame you. I say we have to organize, a baton here, right! It's ok! "Now get out of my office". Don't worry, we're leaving. Put him in a cell. Rest assured, Hop will take care of you. You better listen to your boss, Hop. If any of those dogs try to get in, They'll just do that about, my corpse. Hey stop! I lost track. It's dark in an hour. We will try again tomorrow. Okay, guys. Let's get some rest. Have a coffee there!... Hello how are you sheriff? Want a coffee? Why not? Here it is. Can't you say, something good about the coffee I made? Yes, if you sell it as rat poison, you will be rich. Hmm!... Ah!... Damn it! They disappeared, as if they were swallowed by the desert. Hun, hun!... The footprints led to the river, then nothing. Hmm, hmm!... Damn it, Miller! Can't you say anything but "hun, huh"? This cafe is great, Hop. Ah. thank you, reverend! If you want advice, Sheriff? Certainly. Come on, tell me. I'm listening to you, go! We're not going to have any more coffee. It may take some time to talk. The Sheriff, around Hey Sheriff, what's going on? But what is he doing? But!... Sleeps!... Sheriff! Hunh!... What is happening now? It's your power, Sheriff. We think, that you would like to join us. Go back to bed. Hmm!... That is, losing our money and letting them escape? Hmm!... No, of course not. With Miller on our side. Miller? He advanced!... When they find out, that he's out of prison... Miller will be back! I know what I am doing! Now let me sleep. Donovan, are you crazy? Hmm!... Come on, Sheriff. Come and see! They are leaving the camp Hmm!... How are you? As you did? Look at that bag, it's $ 50,000. But that is a lot of money. We will double them this morning. I just saw some traces of the cart. "Did they see your spies"? Yes. Three carts and some southern women We have nothing to worry about. The only one we have to look after is a colonel. He's about 70 years old. He's wearing a regimental hat. The money will be ours in an instant. I will be able to build the house I dreamed of and it will be ours. When we can cross, the border. I dont care. There it will be safe! By the way, guess who's back in town, Miller Colt. He was lynched or arrested for the coup we gave this morning on the bench. When they pass the hill, we will attack! Switch to positions, to attack. Dad Emma, Emma... Katy, Katy? Ah, oh!... Aih!... Aih!... Hey, there's another one. They have people attacking us from behind. We have to delete it. Come on! They will surround us if we are not careful. Come on, let's go! Haha, haha!... Let's go!... There must have been some Yankees, Colonel. These blue guys would rather run than fight. This is a surprise. He seems to be alone. A real man earns 100 Yankees. But that is!... A priest without a collar. I have never been so happy to see anyone since I left my village. I'm Colonel Charles Jackson, from the Confederate Army. We are grateful to you and your friends for helping us. There is no one left. I'm alone, Colonel. I am a pastor, from the Protestant church! I come from a Denver parish. I know a priest when I see one. This I told them, that a relative... Father Miller will be happy to talk to you later. The reverend is probably thirsty. Yes sir This is Katy, my daughter. Much pleasure. It is a pleasure to have someone as beautiful as you are around, lady. Thanks. I'm Pat MacMurray and she is my wife, Mity. Pleasure. Me too My name is Fred. Fred Smith. It's a familiar name, brother. Please drink some water. Let me take your horse, into the shadows. It is cooler man, because it will be peeling, next to my mare. Thank you, I would be very grateful. My name is Joe. In fact, it's Jose. But it's because... I think I can be a bit gringo, because I never met my father. This water is good. Water? But it's tiquila, that's inside! It is the best water. That's right, Father. We're going, to California. If you don't mind, I'll be with you for a few days. So now the seminar teaches, the art of handling weapons? Why not? There is nothing better than a bullet, to persuade people to go to church. Dad... Richard is dead. We will bury him. Stay with Dorothy. It is a great loss. He was a good man. Let us pray, Lord, to mesmerize your soul in eternal peace. Amen. Let's go. There is nothing we can do for him. You are wrong here. We can get revenge on my husband. Can I help you with something, Dorothy? Yes. Give me back alive and unharmed... brother. It looks like you really didn't like it. Yes, you are right, Reverend. Did you meet her husband? He was my brother. I think this is the fastest way. Directly to the ocean, through the mountains. As soon as we pass the gorge, to the west and go to the coast. Colonel, it's not a bad idea. Sure, it's the easiest way, but I mean getting around. He may have been, the one who attacked us, reverend. You might be right. He is seriously injured. Help me. There's the little bug!... Go!... He lost a lot of blood! We have to try to get the bullet out of him. They're coming back, Colonel! They will attack us again! Take care of the wounds, Katy. Reverend on horseback, quick! There is an abandoned fort there, in the valley. Take us there. Reverend take them. I will do what I can to cover you. Come, my dear. Get up fast! Come on!... Fast forward!... I will open, the gates. I get it before opening the gates, Colonel. Okay, Father. We have to get to the Fort. Now they are not going to catch us. Stop the fire, boys! Let's go!... The curse must end!... Now that they are there, we can go home. This fort resisted, the Indians for years. Do not worry. They are trapped like rats. They will panic when they discover that the wells are dry. Painted clay from the Fort, I promise. It's just a matter of time, friend. Ah!... I hope he doesn't wake up, or scream like a coyote. So, how to get it out of my belly. Huh! Take a look. It would be a good memory, if we clean, Mr. MacMurray. Good. What do you say, Father? I've seen many bullets in my life, but none like this. It looks very good back!... I was a nurse in my father's regiment, so I can take care of him now. And, I've never been without patients, right? Large test rifle. Yes it's right. It is 33, specially built, in england It's a new caliber being made. I think this unusual bullet fits this weapon. To be one of the attackers? Yes!... There is also no water here. We have to make rations, from the water that is there. And I'm afraid it wouldn't last more than a day or two. Reverend, are we safe here? It all depends on them. Come on, smile. If you continue to hate it, you will consume a lot of energy. We will soon run out of water and you will need energy. This is inevitability. Many avoided it and then were happy. Love can moisten the lips, if they are dry. Look what I found! A real piece of artillery. Ah!... What do you think? Ah, it is rusty, worn and very old and will fall apart. I could try, at least. There is gunpowder and cannonballs inside. In a short time, this cannon will scare even the dead. You're right, Mac, try it. This will keep you busy. Hmm!... There is!... The wound hasn't healed yet, so you need to be quiet. I'm dead. I'm really dead. And you are an angel. This is paradise, it cannot be anything else. It's a nice compliment, but you haven't reached heaven yet. I'm just a girl Now you've lost a lot of blood and need to heal. Nice reward for a little blood loss. Now try to rest. You are still very weak. My name is Gary. And mine is Katy. Now rest well. We all sleep. No one should take a nap. Not even flies move, Father. They will be moving very soon, I'm sure of it. A woman like her always makes a man dream. If she wears pants, her husband wears a skirt. She needs a real man. With so many strong women here, we don't need men. "Yes, where do you find this woman"? "It is here in this book". I can't read, ignore it. Hmm!... But maybe you can teach me how to read. Hmm, hmm!... Yes, one of these days. Let's read together. The sun has been hitting them for six hours. Now it's up to us. So, shall we attack at night? Yes, it will be very easy, I think. Shut up, Patrik. But why? Because it's a terrible noise. This guitar is so romantic and so much more beautiful. Those whistles of yours look like a lame cow. Hmm!... This is very interesting. The woman I married just six months ago tells me that he finds out than another man's music, is much more romantic. Don't be upset, idiot I am not an idiot. I have the right impression... that it's not just the guitar that attracts that man. Hmm!... What do you mean? I want to know the truth. You stepped on me, didn't you? Swollen pig! Son of... I am, a trader. Carpets, medicine, all that stuff. The bandits who attacked me stole my goods and let me die. That's what they took from you, son. Look at her. It's a 33 caliber bullet, quite unusual here. You've never seen one before, have you? You're right, I never saw it. He fits my baby perfectly. I was in one of the carts when they attacked us. What are you going to do with me? Wait until you feel better. So you may want to, help us. And the others, will you count too? Nobody here tells the story of your life. I don't see why I shouldn't keep your secret. I think you are taking too much risk in trusting that boy. I don't think we need to worry. He makes his way through the rocks because he never had a chance... walk on the green grass. And we can give him that chance. Fred... did you step on the green grass? Here it is? I left some very big marks, although it is a bad thing. But I am trying. Hmm!... It's good. I think you're trying. Attention, gun to the shoulder! So sense!... Above, above!... Hmm, hmm!.... Good night, Colonel. I'm bringing Patrik some food. Where's Katy? With the wounded. She already ate. Good. Ah!... Uh!... Oh, ah!... Oh... Patrik, no! Patrick! Patrick! Ah... Patrik! What happened? Where am I? I did not know it was you. Ah, so you hit me, right? I thought he was a thug. My little boy... Patrik, forgive me my love!... We need to find a way to enter the Fort. Once inside, we were hidden. The signal will be when the others start the attack. When attacking, do so at the gate. That's how we're going to put them all together. This will keep the path open, for me and Dan... let us get close when they shoot you and destroy them all. Do you agree? And where do we know when to start? We will be ready in about an hour. We are at an advantage, but it can be even better. We will wait until sunset, then attack them. If you make a mistake, withdraw and regroup here. There is no need for unnecessary risks. Donovan's power cannot be far behind. And I would like to leave here tomorrow. Do you want a partner? Whatever you want. Poker? Okay, perfect. You know, I have to tell you this before we start. I have no money. Not even a dollar? Donations only, for building churches. Is very? Very little!... This is a good opportunity to build your chapel, Father. I think you are right. You mean, like, saltines and the like, huh? Hmm!... You can be sure. You are not a professional and I am one of the best in the guild. It won't be easy with you! How long ago did you stop praying, Fred? one year. I don't think I need that!... I have a purpose for you? Then say. 2 dollars against saving your soul. It must be a correct proposal. In everything, it will be infesting well! In this situation, I think the value of my money is below normal. Prayers take precedence. I agree. You can cut. Let's put them in the warehouse over there. At least they won't be in sight. It must not fall into your hands. When I pass through the valley of death, I will not be afraid of any harm... because you are with me. Your scepter and my staff will comfort me. Two cards. Don't say I didn't warn you, Reverend. After a few hands, your voice will be lost. Maybe some tequila. Cards? Yes one! Where are you going, Gary? Don't worry, Katy. I'll be on guard. But you are still very weak. Looking in the dark does not consume a lot of energy. Go to sleep. Our Father in heaven, Hallowed be thy name... Let's forget that. Anyway, I betrayed you. Books are important. They are not like that, or they are! "So how the hell did you always win"? Hmm!... "I meant some books, too". You are a little strange, for a servant of the Lord. I'm not that hard to understand. So I should go, to school again. Do you really think these psalms have any effect? Yes, it seems to help. Thanks for the donation. With pleasure. I think it's time to stand guard. Don't worry, he is dead. He crawled like an Indian. Here he is. Ah, oh!... You have an ugly wound, Gary. Go back to bed and stay there. Go! "We need you tomorrow". Gary, don't forget I want to thank you. Hands up! Take it easy! You scared me, Gary. Hmm!... Why? Did you think I was a ghost, Billy? No of course not. I thought you were one of them, that's all. You are right, I am. Gary!... Come on, stop playing. Can a bullet convince you that I'm not kidding, Billy? A bullet in the head? I bet you fell in love, with one of those girls? There is no point in piercing my skull because of that. "You can take it with you tomorrow when we leave". You won't be here tomorrow. But why? They've probably already discovered who you are. They will not trust you. Now they trust me... I just shot your friend, who was on the run. But why did you do that? Why... they took me with them when, I was injured and they treated me. "And you, Billy, let me die". Is not true. I was looking for you, everywhere. I tried, but I couldn't find you. Their marks disappeared on these stones. Don't you just think that your friend Billy is going to leave you? Ah, ah!... Ah!... Okay, it's over. Ah!... They knew we were coming. Something went wrong. Back! Let's go! At least two are .33 caliber. Very well, Fred. The rifle is fine. Yes, in part. Ah!... You are lucky to have a hard head. You know, Colonel, I remember when I was in prison in Mexico. It was a rumor about Mexicans. On my forehead. A forehead like yours can be broken It's a shame to waste a good whiskey. But it is dripping, a little here, from this business! Ah!... Witch!... You hate me, don't you? I have no special feelings for you, Fred. But this is even worse. I regret it. How serious is that? Abundance is always welcome. It will be shared by this Reverend house. What's the profession? Farmer, Reverend. Above all, it is the maximum for these regions. Remember that we are, all brothers. Ashes in ashes and dust in the dust. Amen. Rest in peace. Stop wasting time with him, Reverend. He's already burning in hell. There's no use hiding!... Our situation is very serious. We will not forget the cannon. Ah!... I've been through many difficult situations, Coronlee, what I am saying is true. I hope!... I sat down, thought and wanted to try something. What is this about. Find help, Colonel. Are you sure you're okay? I feel really good, Colonel, don't worry. But it would be worth a try. I didn't work at a Fort!... It's better for me than sitting here and dying of thirst. Well Mestizo. Good luck then. Thanks. If it is successful, it will still take at least 24 hours. Therefore, we will have to further reduce our proportion of water. Are we going to attack them soon? Do not. You know what Billy said last night. No risks. If we keep them in the sun all day, they'll be light prey. If I don't come back tomorrow, it means that my stallion... it's not as strong as my head. Goodbye, hayh!... Without shooting. Mestizo, we must pray for him, for the first difficulty Reverend why not pray for something more useful, like rain? I'm sorry, Father. It was very stupid. If it doesn't rain, it's not for lack of prayers. Why the hell don't we act now? We're all going crazy sitting here. Patience, friend. Let the sun do its job. I'll tell you what we can do. Send a man of ours inside. He would open the gates of the fort and dump the water "You know that nobody, is so crazy". Yes, you. You are really crazy. You find a way to succeed. Wow!... Ah!... Good morning. Do you want me to take you somewhere friend? Yes, take me with you. I don't think I can keep my feet. Okay, I'm going to Becks. Is this for you? I'll go wherever you go, as long as my feet get some rest. Help me. Ah!... Aih!... Ah!... Ah!... Hayh, Hayh!... So. I am a healthy cat. To the other side. You do not need to worry. Hold this. Do you think it's a flag? That's better. Are you ready, to fire the cannon? Fire! Oh, Patrick! Ah, Patrick! Oh!... Oh God! What the hell are they taking their gates up to? We will attack now. Think about it, Flanaghan. He wouldn't have done that, for no good reason. And I bet they want us to attack them now. This means that they prepared themselves, a surprise for us. Now you have the opportunity to get there by cart, as I planned. Go! Oh, oh!... Is your hand better? Not much. But either way, a farmer doesn't need very sensitive fingers. Do you want to become a farmer? Yes. Ah!... Josy will need help now, that her husband is dead. Hmm!... Reverend? Reverend?... A cart is coming, to the Fort!... Good morning people! The coffee is ready? I can't stay in bed all day doing nothing. Your wound will bleed again, so stay calm for a while. I drink and like you, but I don't help you at all. There is nothing more important than waiting for your wounds to heal. You know them. Do you think we can do this, Gary? We could, Katy, ask Jose to get some people together. What if Jose doesn't come back? Not!... You don't have to think about it, Katy. Who is it? What's going on there? I will not find out... Unless you promise not to move, Gary. Give your word. You have my word. I guarantee you all the threads of these fabrics for at least five years! Do you have water for sale? The water? Hmm!... You mean you don't have any water? And I ran out of water. I ran up here hoping that you had water. How much do you want it? I see that you know how to appreciate, a bargain. It's three dollars. Thanks. It's a $ 2 dollars. I'm sure, but I don't have 2 dollars. Oh!... The sparkle in your eyes is worth 2 dollars. And Flanaghan can never refuse, a beautiful young woman. It's yours. Give me... And the glass. And anyway, there is no one here to use it. "Did you really run out of water"? We have less than four liters. I expect... let no one be against it if I sit in the shade for a while. You can stay if you find any shade. Hmm!... Do you like it? Yes it's wonderful. But the girl who wears it really gives value. Where did you find, a dress like that? It was given to me by a fabric merchant named Flanaghan. Ah, ah!... Look at them. They are completely exhausted. Colonel Jackson said, we didn't have a lot of ammunition. We have no more hope. I can understand that!... Beautiful fabric. AND!... But I don't see you using it, Fred. Why don't you make the gift now? Tomorrow can be too late. Holy Virgin! Until you hold a button, everyone will die! I want the uniforms ready, at dawn. Aih!... What happened, Juan? I sewed my button on my finger. Boys... I saw the colonel's chest, with my own eyes. Besides, the colonel thinks I'm an important man. So it will be easy to steal it. I want to take your horse, Captain. Are we going to kill them all? I already gave him my horse. I repeat! If you touch them with a finger, you will answer in front of me! I will show you if you do not obey my orders! Fred! Why didn't you say everything before? Why, I had no reason. I, Dorothy, was sure you hated me... for me to feel you wouldn?t fall too well. Believe me, that's why I didn't tell you. I believe so!... So he really won nothing. All the money was yours. Yes it doesn't matter. See, I've been making money for my brother for years. I would like to know all of this two years ago. He was always talking, about bad luck. That's why we decided to go west. Playing cards and drinking was his bad luck. I gave him money... because of you. Why are you laughing? "I'm thinking about Richard". You shouldn't play if you don't have that grace. Poor Richard had none. Don't tell me that you didn't know. I hoped that a new beginning in California would change it forever. But I don't think it would have happened. I knew him better than anyone. He would not have been successful. What made you come with us? I was sure that the money, which I gave to Richard, for the trip, it would not be enough. I was worried about you. Fred... That's it!... Please forgive me. "You don't have to be sorry". Gary! Yes Gary. When I heard that a trader named Flanaghan had come here. I had a hunch that it could be you. And now I'm going to kill you. Joke, Gary! Watch that gun! What the hell, you're just ours! I'm Flanaghan, your friend! You are wrong here. Not! Wait! Don't shoot, Gary! Stand up! I can give you money! Gary! You just cleaned up, your conscience, boy. Did you see any sign of the Fort? "It is quiet as a grave". It's like they're all dead. What are we doing? Flanaghan would have given us a signal, if nothing had happened. He was probably caught. Good idiot for nothing. So there is no reason to wait. Why don't we attack? Because I am the boss here. I have a better idea. Look what I found! This one had water all the time! You are crazy! You can give me water!... This water must be poisonous. But why? Check the bottle. We will all go crazy. It was time to lick you, Father. How do you know, that she is poisoned? The merchant came here for a single reason. We will finish, as soon as possible. "So, why didn't he poison the water"? "I'm glad you thought about it". Who will be? It must be some trick, to confuse us!... Why don't we give up on this wild goose hunt? Because I'm more than sure, that Miller got in trouble. Ah!... I think you are trusting him blindly. Everyone thinks he robbed the bank, except you. You can believe, whatever you want. Miller has some quality, it is because he is honest. And I still trust him, Tom. Good. You are the boss until they kick you out of the office. I've had enough! The healthy son of a bitch... Fred I'm going to kill them!... Fred!... I'm going to kill them!... Fred. not!... Get your senses back, Fred. Ah!... If it weren't for him, we wouldn't be without water. He will die, because he spilled! What will you do if you kill him? It's my business! Get out of the way! Drop the gun! Or I'm going to kill you, do you hear? Don't get in my way! I'm sorry, for putting you in this mess, but I wouldn't have done it without you. That's it, guys! This time, we will conquer, the Fort once and for all! Let's go! Ah!... I'm going, Father! Stop the fire! I told you to stop the fire! That's better. If someone shoots, the girl gets a bullet! Wait a minute!... Wait a minute!... I'm going to talk to you. What you want? If you want a hostage, take me. Let her go, okay? Come, Father. Come here. I have the strange feeling that I have seen this man somewhere before. Here I am!... Keep walking. Stand still. I was right. Man can change his habits, but not his appearance. Miller Colt. Bounty hunter!... I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to kill a famous bounty hunter. Oh!... Oh!... Ah!... A bullet is very simple for you. I want you to leave. Martin, the water! Martin! Smith, the water! Water! Water please!... You can drink, but young lady!... Look, I brought some water. Ah, give me! Father Miller first. He's hurt. Hmm!... It is an honor to know, that during the war, against a people and soldiers like you. When the hell do you tell him, do we want to see the box? I would like to know something, Colonel. What did the bandits want from Forte? They wanted the treasure, from the colonel's regiment. Give that dog, it's crazy This is amazing! Stay at home, I know what to do. We would love to know why so many people gave their lives for this. Here. As a friend, you deserve this honor. I didn't know you were in the army, Captain. But, only one!... Yes, I was under Lee's command, Colonel. I understand. Boys! A blast, by the regimental flag! And now for the flag, shoot! Thanks. Thank you, Captain. "You have nothing to do, Colonel". A treasure is it? None of us will get rich from this! You're wrong. Honoring the flag enriches you spiritually. But and where is the treasure? Sorry, Colonel... but our captain must receive an award, then we must leave. What decoration? A wooden cross. You respect me!... Hyah, hyah!... Goodbye, goodbye friends! "Where are your comrades"? Speak! "They went to the Fort in the desert". Responds! Are they in the abandoned fort? Hey Sheriff!... Look, we found Hmm!... It's all right. It's all right. There is something wrong here. Joe, Tom, come with me. It looks like you fought, a little battle here. We have some prisoners for you. Move faster!... I am grateful to you, Colonel. I didn't think of paying them here Joe! Tom, come on! He's a good boy, Sheriff. Hmm!... Colonel, I don't think you saw an armed priest. Yes, Miller Colt. He's in there, but he's seriously injured. I will take you to him. Come this way. Nice to meet you, Reverend!... What brings you here, Donovan? I was passing, Miller. "You didn't trust me, or did you"? I was not sure about Father's story. But I trusted you all the time. And now I know everything about you. I know why you became such a bounty hunter. Every time you kill a bandit, you will take revenge on your father. On the day the boy died, I realized that I had no right to take revenge. God said: vengeance is mine. That's why I wanted to build a church. In Tunksam City? Yes!... Well, you have enough money to build it. As well? You can receive your last reward, Miller. There is $ 10,000 dollars. The others insisted that you got them, so you have the church. Hmm!... Father, we're leaving. Good luck, Colonel. Good luck to all. Now Fred, you said you were going to be a farmer. Will you really give up poker? We have to be farmers, don't we, Dorothy? Father, I hope that one day you will come to California to visit us. Must come. Katy and I don't want anyone else to marry us. Perhaps, I will marry both. Both, yes. We are already married We thank the Reverend!... See you soon. See you later. Save? Hey, everyone, get out! It's time to go to church, folks. Let's go! Hey! Come back with my beard towel! Come on, it's time to go to church! Let's go! Don't you think this church is a little primitive, George? We are going to build a better one, that we get more money. I'm sure it won't be long, mainly with the help of your bank. It will always be like this!... It looks perfect like that. Reverend, I kept ringing, that bell. I don't think you will be able to bring anyone here. Don't worry, Margaret. It's time to go to church. While they pray, we will drink. Sheriff... Fuck them! Posters were our field of action! Oh!... "CLOSED FOR CHURCH SERVICE" "END"
