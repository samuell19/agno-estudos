It was correct your card is now blocked At your service, sir, Good Day Goodbye What do you do here? - engraving, offsetting -that's all we do Champagne? - who is involved in all this? a father and daughter paint it and stamp it it's a family business. do you want sound? - I know what he's saying He's a con artist but replacing the plaque - that's the only worry here they are now you can see everything see, here, the buyers now are convinced they have won now it remains only to check the quality of the banknotes what's up? what happened? everything is fine soon you won't see such workmanship fine, but don't become too proud watch, watch! whatever happens, do not lose sight of that envelope Never! What are you doing? Damn! I told you not to touch anything, idiot! - never touch anything... it's trouble which shouldn't happen I called, all right! - we work together. you are always wrong look what you did! -see? I see. - what do you see? I am unable to differentiate if it's true of false even in the French National Bank they will accept them do you want to count it? - I trust you congratulations. For the first time I see work of such quality! me too! we watched the envelope while they have their attention drawn to other customers, he replaces it It's not surprising that banknotes passed the test for authenticity because he produces the real one then the counterfeit forgery you are required - Am I? who is this? It's a new face. so far only to watch it you're not usually that magnanimous - I like his style you're smoking too much! So I have submitted your application, but to be honest,I'm not very optimistic would you tell me why? - Finli has a better dossier maybe it's not as impressive in terms of results but it's a lot more reassuring you Want me to believe you're not the one who chooses your successor I hope to give my opinion and.. what will you say? sorry to interrupt. - What is it, Finli? Hello, Julia. - Hello. Lardier has just been nabbed in Milan with pockets full of counterfeit money and..? And there were messages back at his hotel with instructions for a robbery in Paris All signed Maxime. I knew it! I knew he'd be back. That son-of-a-bitch couldn't stay in hiding you know why? he needs to prove to himself he's still the best but this time I'm going to nail the bastard extradite Lardier back here right away see that's the difference between you two? If you'd had that information you would've tried to grab Maxime all by yourself to get my job whereas Finli has a sense of hierarchy will you try to get the job for me? there'a rumour Brussells is preparing an internal investigation so what we're going need is results If you really want my job, you're going to have to catch someone 'red handed' and I mean a really big bust it will be good for the service and look really good on your dossier Two cards for Mr. Kruger Two cards. - Please Two. - Please Two cards raise five thousand I pay five... and raise you ten. I pass. - Me too I am curious I fold - fold Troika. Not bad it's always worth it to fool someone stupid But Kruger is always one to waste money. the Golden Rule is- not to get involved in their feelings or have any connection with the victim that would ruin everything. so what can be done? In my opinion, is not too late to stop Goodbye. what happened..? our friend was pleased with the evening and he wants to play more do you know where to find it? - Belvedere in Monaco. I will not go back. excuse me? I cannnot bring back your brother and that too! I'm too old to hear your preaching Lardie will be detained the police will find it under his bed counterfeit banknotes - For success! Fred! - Hello. want a drink? - Yes we have a great team. If you need any help, remember me. people trust me. Will you go? No, at my age I have to keep my fingers fit I do at least two sweaters a month. otherwise you lose dexterity Let me leave I have a set place in the province. Great you approached the 'girl'. but you found her today. today I did. -was she impressed? better! Champagne? My dad says life is too short to live it peacefully your father is a wise man. I haven't met him. really? - Are you free tomorrow? why? he's organised a small charity party you might meet him. with pleasure, but tomorrow I have a lunch with a client. no problem come together. please. - I'll think of something. every Tuesday there is one and today in particular? is today Tuesday? shall we'll give them something to look at why? because I'll kiss you I told you not to include this directly to the security system the devil only knows what is happening are you sure you don't want to listen to this? I wont get much tonight according to my informant, today he went hunting I'm hurrying, we should show him too soon here, now we have a picture there is something in it, right? what are they doing? - sending signals are you sure, - do you need any need more? I am sure it's okay - you are charming couple. I have been married for 30 years. Marriage is the best thing in life this gypsy does he remind you of anyone? there are two sides to everything - good and bad. This projector for example... It can show us something, right? Get it? - Yes. will you marry me? what? Will you marry me? they did not wait for anyone. She is the victim. Champagne? What's up? I'm just having a break. It's my watch - do not run at 7am We must not lose them. My informant spoke of a big bust do not lose sight of them what's going on? - what's up? Maxime's in Paris Can I talk to you for a minute? - Go ahead. If I have your "big stick" is there a deal still on? If Finli gets hold of Maxime you are out of the running You have been trying to nail Maxime for 15 years and Finli's certainly not going to do it! I think I have something else but I will have to have free rein and do it my way. Forget the code of good conduct when has that ever stopped you? I asked you to call me. - It looks like I forgot Then listen carefully. There is something new Why didn't you tell me that girl is the victim? I need to know everything what the plan is & especially when! Move Lardier! - You've got you wrong man How's it going? Who is this do you think? - I think it's the gypsy the girl's left him? she was here. - what does it mean? Let us forget everything - what should I forget? you were right. we can't can go back don't do this to me.. If he gets caught, everything is lost - I think that's part of the game If you get him alone you'll have to make him stop What! what are you doing! Hey, fella.. you? Another! Stop him! Get in..here in the trailer! do you want to go back? Are you a fan of mine? what is your name? Molina. Lieutenant Julia Molina I knew a Molina once. He was a good man not very pleasant, but good the Lieutenant believes that we're planning a strike... she wants us to say something illegal, right? Yes. you, might be more serious when you see these counterfeiting money is not a joke job It has a 10 year minimum.. even with a good lawyer! If the lady has made such an effort to come here it may be for another reason. Can I? You say you this and then at 2o'clock come with plans to ruin our future - what should I do? you're running a circuit with the Letalek city gang -stacks of money and making promises -I think it's time to quit. good idea! and something else.. so think carefully I have to watch you and you will continue what you started, I will write in my report, that nothing happened Sorry? I will give you an alibi but in return I get a share Tell her to leave while I get rid of these! If we work in a team it wouldn't be a bad idea to change the tone Go to hell! you can act like that but at a certain age onwards the years spent in prison seem twice as long and harsher you can do it if you want, but I do not work with the police! maybe this game is too complicated for you and you want to play? I don't think you miss your colleague very much In such situations, Francois has a tendency to improvise I was not sure if I would be okay So what do you think I will be doing? Just say, you will find other reasons Champagne? I want to up your desirability Done I'd like to remind you of the rules now The auction is held for the purchase of the animal whose image is shown to you & to raise funds for the association Marc, please This is Patapuf, aged -3 months.

Exactly. Let me introduce Miss Julia Molina Good afternoon. - Hello The client you have spoken of - Ah, yes!

It might help maybe I have not met the right man yet Michel is the father of Garance. They should be together he might want to meet you again, - so let him ask men often ask to see me again but currently your charm isn't working The mark is for the bank in Luxembourg That will hardly seemed exotic Wrong. Dyubreil has a weakness for high-income investments in securities entice him with a 15 percentage yield if you're quick he will ask to increase his investment and if he doesn't acept it? - the important thing is to not insist you must win his trust and the money will come along And how long you will wait? - everything depends on the client so we call it 'mating' season. and do you think you will continue with the "wedding" plans? screw you, Lieutenant? or is the game too complicated for you?

Excuse me? your client. You have no intention to take part in the auction? Ah, yes, of course Garance loves the lipopotamite. - Lipopotamite? a small so called hipopotamus I am sure she will be happy with it you leave me no choice let's keep it a secret between us see you again? - I promise. you can't be that stupid, if adorable customers like you Mr Dyubreil I am very grateful. on behalf of the association...

Come in, please. take him, honey, you won the hipopotamus wooer Get this shit. it's very nice of you to give the money. But the giraffe was just to find a buyer Right, Vance? Yes, and the fool was keen to have it. And paid us 15,000. -and the gentleman was very generous furthermore, he paid cash! now you understand. you see, Garance is not so stupid what happened? - we got had No, you did good work and the other generous donors today don't worry, they will receive the news and photos of their 'goddaughter'. Incidentally, if you like house, this was rented does that surprise you? you have a right to know but thanks to you I met this young lady Friends call me Maxime I have to tell you, that much of this is ridiculous at first I thought, you wanted to join the team furthermore, you looked right and then I quickly realised we were being taken for fools Then I hired Vance. - he has magic hands! I understand everything. Your problem... you and your friends is that you don't share. This does not apply to you Here. this is for you Come, and sit down. It's a pity. we're planning work would you would have liked we could have worked as a family Sorry. will you play? I warn you, I play to win Bitch, bitch, bitch. If this is the man which I think I've been seeking to help my career I am sure that she's been deceived - and Solal was with her he's up, but he got counterfeit banknotes that will get him arrested You mean that you lost on purpose? I have one weakness - I hate to lose. Maxime said that something was planned When Solal gets out of the game, it will have to be replaced In about 24hours someone will call me And a someone we know will be very kind. tell me why I'm being held? - Go! Let me know where you left the money! do you know how much money there was? you don't pay with counterfeit money - what? what counterfeit money? what is he doing here? - We found him with Vance. We only found a few notes. - you can't keep him for long Keep him in custody and downloading the monitoring of the others I have new information on the father of the girl when it will all end Fred, I want to know everything that we have on Maxime Hurry and call me this morning! Sir, can talk to you for a second? Gentlemen, let me introduce you to Lieutenant Julia Molina. These are inspectors Lebran and Leblan. Department of Internal Investigations. Good afternoon. - Good day. I leave you, as I have to keep questioning talk about anything but sell your granny for a bribe If you do not mind, we would like to ask you some questions A glass of water? I feel like your boss doesn't like us. With ice or without? I think your boss thinks we are adversaries we'll just see otherwise it's just his role The results do not do justice to your boss we know that some 'seized' money was in private hands. The most likely case is... Barns had his eyes closed. or just as bad - he is organising in any case, this will be reflected in the report so if you have something to tell us we will gladly listen. I do not drink I tell you it has nothing to do with me! I never deal in counterfeit! You can't change your skills! - Captain, he hit me! You will not get out of here until you tell me the truth! I tell you that I didn't do it. How many times do I have to explain? Shut it! I warn you, I am in a bad mood. All right start talking.. - there are many rumours of a small poker party such things are organised, to choose a new victim. they have a 30 year old man who is confident, talkative... an ideal customer His name? - Cash! everything was working in his favour. Even the name! - I don't know. While he was playing he, kept saying somemething like: "ultimately it will have to be paid in cash" And a paper rolls under your bed of false notes? just by chance..? I will help you with his description better still tell us about Maxime! - who? your boss! In your email Inbox there are 12 requests with instructions for "work". And it was signed by Maxime! what do you know about this? how many times have I told you that you should not let your feelings interfere with your work sure, it sucks he was made a fool I agree they took you for a sucker but it was well intended like Kahuna. I love that character. - you can not deny that they are classy! I almost regret that I was there You were there! Hi, Fred how are you? You lost my number? What's the game plan? - are you not you happy to see me? for a boy from Santa Wan you don't waste your abilities. But Maxime is a real wizard. You'll have to call me unless you are a rat They say he took in Antwerp 17 million in jewels and with a big smile put them in boxes of candy. Okay,this can happen to anyone. although this job is hard here you can keep it I got lucky, it's just my size. If I'd known I would have bought the bracelet Next time I'm going for cigarettes. - at least finish the game! This morning they held Vance. he has already called me. - What did he say? he said it looks like they're after Maxime. he may need us the more difficult job, the more enjoyable it is to work very interesting, but very boring How about robbery? 12 million. for you 10 percent. is that enough? 30. If you can hit a birdi I'll give you 40 did I tell you I play well You weren't aware.. - can you get a hole in one? I'm offering peace how long have you known each other? this is my sister well, are you with us? And where are we going? - You do not mind luxury..? Just imagine a hotel washed in sunlight. I can not tell you precisely it's exact location. say it is somewhere on the coast. what happens is that after a few days guests of this seaside palace, will leave in the safe diamonds worth several million. but the diamonds cannot be traced. they're usually used for operations of a dubious nature while this gentleman is making the most of the luxury in his room, other guests at the hotel are going to the safe vault and I will make a courtesy visit and while I'm there there will be an emergency I have no doubt in the ability of the team. However, to escape from curious onlookers we will create a smoke screen I think this will be for the best. it will divert everyone's attention what is the problem inspector - I have to ask you to come with me Stop! Police! your team will need to create a lot of action that will get noticed try to involved into the game the security & management of the hotel your role is to coordinate the work of the team we, in turn, will get into the security system after we disable it, it will only remain to get to the diamonds. we prefer to go through the steam room - the hotel sauna. we usually try not to apply force, except if it's absolutely necessary while we're into the sauna base operation, you will fake the heart attack everything must get attention to the smallest detail Sir! are you OK Make way! Sorry! the success will depend mostly the full amount of time In my calculations, I need an hour, to make a hole in the wall and open the safe you'll need to play the last part with Garance Look how beautiful it is! - very beautiful yes it reminds me of San Tropez. sorry to interrupt you, but if we must play a married couple, I would prefer to work with Julia. a great place everything just as I like! Yes, it's very beautiful. Nothing has changed over the past 5years. You were here five years ago? - Yes, I told you. Really, no, I did not know that. - With Bernard. That idiot you were going with - No! You were here 5 years before with him? - Stop! I needed respect! - There you go! Did you like it I don't think so. In that case, I would be happy to work with your daughter after we get the diamonds, there will only remain 8 minutes, to escape before automatic control of the safe reactivates the good news is that the diamonds are not registered anywhere and therefore do not exist and diamonds that do not exist can not be stolen. it only remains to celebrate our success Cheers! do you believe that she is his daughter? - Yes, but you - my sister! do you not wonder if he wants to get intimate? Please - I mean,... only without the filth he may be a liar, but he shows he is a gentleman. by the way, he invited me to dinner Bravo! do you think you can do it I am a policewoman this is my job Yes - Fred is dead what - stop everything! this is the work of Letalek and his gang I warned you, it would bring trouble Fred won't satisfy them. they will still be coming I had to escape even then you knew Maxime we called in time you understand this we can handle it. - and he can kill us! do you hear what I mean - explain that to Fred! we must finish what we started, you find who did this! you knew from the outset? you know that it was Maxime Francois is right, it's my fault - well you think so, huh? Leave me alone! - you don't seem to understand! Nice stuffed animals - talk of "love" and all that shit don't fool with me tell me a reason not to kill you! Maxime would never call me, not without prior warning not now he thinks that everything is under his control you really think, that you can fool him If Lardier is to be believed he looks like that I know this face - he's nowhere on our files if he does exist maybe he's just some small time poker player with counterfeit money Nah, no professional would take Lardier on, they all know he's too dangerous maybe he's just some sort of swindler who didn't know who he was screwing I know where I've seen him Look! - Later! If you touch her things Julia won't like it the new face... that's how she described him all we have to do is call Mickey, the phone tapping specialist she works with get me this Mickey guy oh, and find Molina for me! Good evening. - 'evening. You look nice. - and you are please to see me? I do not think about that again very good, life is too short to waste does your brother know, that we are here to dinning together he is not my brother - should I jealous? what would I do when I met an amateur. put up with it isn't that so? he hates me, that is obvious & it irritates me that he cannot hide it -why does that worry you? perhaps the time has come to change that so, are we friends or enemies? do you have many enemies, Maxime - only you, Lieutenant. you know that we do have things in common after the arrest of Vance, I made some investigations and I must say that I don't understand completely your intentions I don't not know whether I trust you either I know not to believe you, but I have not always been an exemplary employee pretty soon the police will know something's up I might be forced then to change my career tomorrow I leave. A South African will spend time here on annual leave taking advantage of my residence here when he rents it they are officers of the Kruger mines. - that's is good news. the bad news is that they will lose 12 million dollars but we do not wish them to be our enemies The boss is one of those who the French used in Algeria and Chile. your colleague - is a specialist in interrogation I am starting to understand why you want Cash. sometimes he would rather that they become victims why are you sure he will cope the Chief hires his men! Letalek. shall we sit at the table? Cash will not go for it easily Tonight I propose to forget about it Please come in I assure you, the situation is under control why sit in the dark? It's my eyes. Cash has taught me a lesson there was no need. you think, I am too old instead he left me in the car, like a tired old man, nothing will happen. You have nothing to be guilty about I had to insist to go along with him we can handle it Lardier will receive 20 years I don't care about Lardier In prison without help, he is a nobody he should have to pay. I do not know where he will meet you I'll call you. Julia, for once you need to select the side you're on Good evening, Lieutenant. what are you doing here - we have a search warrant. I put it on the table, and I went to make coffee we looked for you and you had gone we could not find you and so we came looking for you what do you want - a talk. you should take an example from Finli. he at least cooperated he told us about the methods you use: watching the handling of envelopes... sure, he's bit you jealous, but still... few are worrying about your career we can help. Saying more that would be convincing we can do a deal they say that you're working in a large bunch. tell us and we will forget for you some of the unpleasant details you can even get a promotion while considering it we will hold and the information that you missed you! return them to me. - you talk about our rights I'm not Lebran... - Lebran is blond, I am Leblan. I'm unable to tell Lebran if he's blond and Leblan is a fool. By the way the, received message is for you. One is Cash interested in how it was tonight. so it wasn't boring. Julia, it's Barns. where the f#@* are you? we've been looking everywhere for you I need information on those guys you've been tailing does he treat you like that? I think we'll have more time tomorrow and that's all you know Yes, that is it. Lieutenant Molina asked to prepare the dossier Dyubreil was one, but when I got the information she was no longer interested. then what are you saying - don't you think it's funny. Alexander Dyubreil a big shot in the food industry. but after only 6 months he died of an aneurysm. Come in! I think I found something. I knew I knew that one Francois Macquarie.picked up 5-6 times for fraud teamed up for a long time with one Solana Merikur the one who was killed last year - the very one and guess who was convicted of his murder except the case was dismissed Lardier! Sorry. go get hime for me! it might take a little bit of time we sent him to the cell to sleep. - wake him up! Hello It's me. The Belvedere, Monaco. 16 hours I will be there 'For rent' Leblan, this is Molina. did I wake you I accept your suggestion. but we will work together You trust us - Report. you're going to have to wear a bathing hat Oh, come on! - I told you the more ridiculous you look the better why did I ever look like a psychopath, to you? probably because of your face now his billionaire with his assistants elementary but it might be worse, right a billionaire can be fickle, billionaire's are always whimsy! Here we go download their system from the video. we'll damage it for several days so all they see is ours Some's drowning! call a doctor! Come on! I wanted health exercises, not military exercises! now I want to eat! first, some time on the bicycles then you will eat You'll eat when you want! I am hungry! here! Do you have sushi Yes. - OK, bring me some! I feel like it's my life with this deal I hope that this is the last time. I will work for a while, but alone, OK Alone! I want the place to myself! - no, really, we're paid so much money we should be able to he's left alone, right Go. remember to join us on the boat. I promise to get on board first. I am in it for the diamonds. as anyone is looking to do. when we've finished, I will give you your share. should I feel guilty? not anger, love. If you didn't want it for yourself, you would not be here. and him? He knew that. he knew it was a game but he looses. such are the rules. everybody out! This is Kruger - the man with the diamonds. we should not interfere but just in case, set a camera in the room. how are you doing? - very good look here, they begin to open the safe. warn me when to start the next stage. are you still working together? and you still want to marry me? what was that last night, forgiveness? It was necessary. do you want to tell me something - Yes. you can wait in the library on the first floor. - Thanks. Mom! Letalek and his people are in adjacent corridor. Left of you. Quick to the left! are you coming - damn! well, captain, one day you can't spend without me I wanted personally to apologise. I realised that the counterfeit notes were not your business. we want you to meet him. - you want me find him for you. Bravo! would you like some candy? did you like it? Remember Solana Merikur I have an alibi, they freed me. I will share something with you. I think that Cash and his friends will want to repeat that to who ordered the murder of Solal and this man could be your boss Maxime - No, no, no. I never had a boss, I am independent I will never believe that, you are too stupid Brussels, Internal investigation One Captain Leru wants to talk to you Yes, I am, you were checking on some inspectors for me Leblan and Lebran No, don't be ridiculous what? are you sure? Okay, okay we'll call you In the Internal Investigation Department there never were Inspectors Leblan or Lebran You have a new message where are you? we are beginning , they are in a safe room. if you have been delayed, tell me when you will arrive Good morning, gentlemen welcome where are you? the plans have changed. We decided that we can not use Lebran he's chickened out - this is immoral! I doubt it will benefit his job, but more likely to avoid jail If you give some of your colleagues, I'll try to help you You should get out They've got Cash Why? Letalek are the people with briefcases, that safe was not reliable he left the diamonds in the room. we can't tell these fools as we go we will encounter Cash & other thugs while Lea is explaining we will get Cash freed, and I will take the suitcase. How - in the old way! I was expecting the luckiest stroke of 30 years! I stopped hoping. I thought I would die with empty handed I started as nobody. I did a 10 years stretch. and 12 million! Not a bad way to end a career! I'm sorry to do this... Get in, come on! and the next time some asshole tries to relieve the mine of it's diamonds shady bunch don't bother calling the police. you just kill him! violence is the only thing these people understand! do you drink?
