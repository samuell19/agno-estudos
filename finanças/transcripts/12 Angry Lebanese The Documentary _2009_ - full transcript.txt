"I still don't know if I believe him Maybe I don't." "But you voted not guilty without hesitation" "11 men voted guilty." "It's not easy to raise my hand" "and send this boy off to die without talking about it first" - "Well, who says it's easy?" - "No one". "Just because I voted fast?" "I believe this boy is guilty." "You can talk for ages I won't change my mind" "I'm not trying to change your mind." "All I'm asking for is to talk about someone's life." "It's not something we can decide in less than 5 minutes." "Supposing we're wrong?" "What?" Here it should be more cynical. "What? Supposing we're wrong?" "It's easier for me to think that the roof of this room will fall on our heads." "Stop this nonsense!" Casting for number 3 or number 8. Number 3 insists that the boy put on trial should certainly be executed by the electric chair. Number 8 did not say a word. Neither did he say that the guy is wonderful, innocent and fabulous and so on... He just asked for the evidence. The difference between number 8 and number 3 is that number 8 thinks. Number 3 is controlled by his instinct he is controlled by his desire to kill the boy... The first time I heard about the theater project here in prison I heard the news from the guys I mean the inmates. I was in the handcraft workshop and then one inmate working in the administration came in and asked who wants to participate in a theater play. First, I did not understand the idea I thought that people from outside will come and present a theater play. We went to the first meeting just to know more. We weren't taking it seriously I went to the meeting. But I was considering it all as a lie just like people who come to us once, twice... and then disappear. - "I just want to kill him!" - Sick! You are a sick person! Stay in character Hussam! - "I'm sick?" - Yes you are sick! Not a liar! "I'm sick? I am sick? Leave me! Leave me!" "I want to kill him!" "I want to kill him!" - "I'm a psycho? You are a psycho!" - You are a psycho! - "You are a psycho!" - You are a psycho! After a while, the number of applicants went down from 150, to 30, to 6. At the end, we were only 5 selected from our building. We discovered that there were applicants from other buildings as well from the convicts Bldg and from Bldg (D) At the end the total of all participants was 45.

First theme. Proving yourself. Think of it outside the context of the play as we've read it. Proving yourself. We will talk about it in two phases Phase one is about you. If you want to link this topic to your personal history. When or how did you try to prove yourself? - Rateb, are you done? - Just a moment! Join us. Rateb. - Ali, can you help? - Dinosaur. - Just wait a moment! - Answer Dinosaur. I'm charged with rape. Actually, it is not a charge. It's reality. How long is your sentence? 5 years. My name is Anwar the Iraqi serving a 15-year sentence for murder I'm now in my 7th year, I still have 8. My crime is drug dealing unfortunately it's drug dealing and trafficking forged money and other forged goods. Of course, I wasn't the forger but I confessed everything. Why am I in Roumieh? Because I'm guilty. I'm sentenced to death for murder. I'm convicted of murder I've already served 14 years of my sentence and I still have one year - 14 years. - Yes. How old were you when you were put in prison? 17 and a half I'm serving a life sentence I've been in prison for 16 years. That's it! - What is your charge? - Murder. I'm charged for murder I've been in Roumieh prison for 4 years and no judgment has been pronounced yet I've been here for 5 years My charge is drug dealing. I'm serving a life sentence! And I've been here for 18 years. Hello, I'm Youssef Chankar or Grandpa Chankar. Or, as MP Ghassan Moukheiber calls me the Dean of the prisoners participating in this play. Why? Because I've been in prison for 18 years. Not 18 months or 18 days 18 years 216 months 6570 days 157440 hours 9446400 minutes 566784000 seconds. But I'm not serving an 18-year-sentence. I'm serving a life sentence. Oh world full of wonders! Full of treason for no reason. Oh world full of wonders! Full of treason for no reason. Full of tears and suffering. Full of tears and suffering and those who forgot about us are not to blame and those who forgot about us are not to blame. The easiest psychological defense mechanism that we as human beings use is "burying the truth" or what we call denial. As if the incident did not happen to me I reject it. We need to start with your own real life stories. If we don't talk about real things we can't do monologues we will have nothing to communicate to the audience. There are people here whom I still know nothing about. Now you have the chance. If I hear 1, 12 or 13 participants opening up I would be ready to tell my story and tell you about my family as well. Ok then, let us start from here. If there is no trust we cannot work together. A group without trust can never achieve a thing. They will all fail. Hussein, we are in prison We are not out there free... Guys! We can build trust. The first rule for building trust is letting each one of you express his feelings freely. Even if we do not agree we have to listen to each other. It's the best thing about it. We are working on personal stories coming from you and you decide what to share with us and what you are ready to share. Otherwise nobody will be able to listen. I will start with the first topic Proving yourself. Many times I've reached death to prove my personality. To prove myself "Look at me, I'm Hussein" I was put behind bars for this reason I've even reached the point of ignoring my parents, my family and my values I imposed myself as the only one in control. I did wrong to my father I did wrong to my mother I did wrong to my siblings and I did wrong to my four wives whom I married to prove my personality. As if I was telling people "Look! Hussein has four wives". But at the end I found nothing but failure Always failure. Do not think that one single day was successful. Only failure. At the end my biggest punishment Zeina... It was when my dad died while I'm in prison. I, Hussein Noun, the tough powerful man couldn't even walk a few feet behind my dad's coffin. - Thank you Hussein. - No problem. Chankar? I will show you a sentence that summarizes what I am. Outside prison, I was a jackass. Let me correct the spelling I don't want you to correct I wrote it this way. Being a jackass has cost me my whole life. Why are you saying I'm not? Why are you saying I'm not? Outside prison I was a real jackass and I'm paying my life as a result. My life is now divided half outside prison and half inside prison. Personally I don't like to talk about the past. It happened that I talked about it during these years and I know the pain it causes me for several days. Sometimes we have chats in the cell and I find myself obliged to talk. I tell a little and then feel very bad I don't want to talk. I've been through a lot I've been hurt by the people closest to me and my personality is the reason behind all my troubles. Before entering prison no one even dared to deal with me and no one dared to tell me I was wrong. No one in the family whether old or young dared to say I was wrong. Whether old or young! My mother was the only exception She is the only one I respected. All the others were nothing to me. This is the personality that ruined my life. This is the personality that put me behind bars and made me pay my whole life Why would I talk about it still? Why would I even mention it? I've said it all I'm a jackass. What do you want more? I didn't say I was a smartass outside prison I'm saying I'm a jackass. You guess why I say jackass because I'm in prison because I never negotiated I never accepted to give and take I always had the last word. Nouri, come closer. If you pass, join the circle and say it. - Join the circle and say pass. - I don't wana talk about anything. Nothing at all? Nothing. My situation is even worse. I don't want to talk. - You too were a jackass outside prison? - Not a real jackass. I was a kid who was fooled by some people. A kid who was fooled by some people. They told me "it 's a matter of 6 months, a year" "and you'll get out as a real man" 15 years have passed and look at the man I've become. Enough. Pass. Attention, attention to the sergeants and chiefs of all three floors. Please open the cells for those I'm calling to come down to the theater. An eye for an eye. Remove your line. You'll say "Come on Sirs, let's start". Let's repeat that, ok! I will give you the modifications today. - "Come on, Sirs" - "Let's start". In the play a boy is accused of killing his father. There is the jury who needs to come up with an unanimous verdict. They are tired in the courtroom the members of jury are tired. The jury wants to finish with this matter. They aren't thinking about the boy who killed his father. They don't care if he'll be executed or not. One of the members is taking the matter too personal and wants the boy dead. He won't succeed because at the end the jury finds the boy innocent. Character number 8 supports the accused and asks the rest of the Jury for one hour to discuss the issue of the boy who had no lawyer to defend him. - "Why don't we talk in turns?" - "Indeed, let's go once around the table". "Each one will have two minutes You start first." "It's hard to say." "I just guess he's guilty." - Say it louder. - "I mean I thought" "I thought it was obvious" - "I mean, did anyone see him doing it?" - It's not a question! - "Somebody did see him doing it!" - "Somebody saw him doing it!!" - "Did anyone see him doing it?" - "Somebody saw him doing it!!" "Did anyone see him doing it?" It means that the neighbor saw him doing it! "Somebody saw him doing it" the son of a...! Ok? Go. The role of number 2 reflects a little part of me. The part of timidity or hesitation. It's someone who wants to say something and is afraid to say it. And when he says it he's also afraid because he said it. It's like me and I'm shy particularly with ladies. The foreman of the jury is someone who is at times grumpy. Does this character reflect your personality Anwar? No, I'm not close to this character I don't get annoyed or bothered from the group like he does. Are you sure Anwar? - Yes I'm sure. - Are you sure Anwar? - Yes. - Are you sure Anwar? Yes I'm sure. Why you're asking? - Come on, let's go by turn. - "This is a poor woman" "laying on her bed and she can't sleep." "It's really hot, her window is open" - "You picture that" - No, it's the same intonation. Zeina, you didn't tell me to memorize this. - You told us till page 10 - Ok. - Ok? - This has nothing to do with that. Fine, you're right. - What do we do now? - What did we say here? Try to correct it yourself I've already given you the remark. "She is a poor woman." "She is a poor woman laying on her bed and she can't sleep." - This is ok. Right? - Right. - "It's really hot, her window is open" - Write "AND" her window is open I don't have "AND" I will add it now. AND her window is open. And now ask us to see if we got your point. - Wait a second, "can you picture that?" - Bravo. - You are asking us. - I know, I know, perfect! Well this role suits me well I have tried many other roles. But I found myself in this one I have an issue and I'm overcoming it with the help of Zeina Daccache I'm a very curious person. I gossip a lot. I'm nosy about things that are not my business. But I just poke around! Before, I was like number 3 The edgy guy who acts impulsively. He thinks that he is always right and never listens to others. This is how I was. If I were like number 8 outside I wouldn't have been here in prison now. What are we doing here then? We are here to talk about a kid who was corrupted by life. Do you know what it's like for a kid to live on the streets in this city. After having lost his mother? He was put in an orphanage when he was 9 years old while his father was serving a two-year sentence in jail for forgery. Is this good for a start? They say the boy is very bad tempered and wild, that's true. But do you know why he's like that? Because he was beaten every day of his life. Every single day for 19 years. This is pretty miserable and I think we owe him a few words. Nothing! We owe him nothing! In the play, I'm closer to the boy who committed the crime I'm closer to him. None of the characters of the play except the boy who committed the crime. - He's very much like me. - Why? Because, like me he was a victim of injustice. But you did commit your crime Didn't you? Yes I did. So why are you saying that the boy is a victim of injustice? Because I feel he is Because ever since he was a child he used to be beaten and hurt and nobody had mercy on him. The same thing happened to me. And no one asked about your past? Nobody asks about the past They only ask about what they see. An eye for an eye. At first, I didn't participate in anything Not a single thing I used to sit and watch the guys. Some acting, others dancing Some telling their life stories. Others crying, some turning out grumpy And I was only watching. At times, I've comforted some. Told them to be patient and that everything will be ok. While I was sitting and watching I was often asked: "what are you doing in this theater project?" I replied: "just spending time making fun of the guys". Really I'm not joking. They used to ask me "Honestly, what are you doing in this play?" I answered "Nothing, I just sit and watch". And Zeina kept on asking me "Capo, what do you want to do?" I'd answer "I have no idea". When I first heard about the project I joined the group but I was sure I will not act in the play. But I directly felt enthusiastic for the project I felt that something unprecedented is being achieved in this prison. So I wanted to participate and I love theater since I was outside prison. Why didn't you want to act? Maybe, I'm shy I don't like acting, I would rather do anything backstage. So what are the sentences that are mostly used by children? - I want. - I don't want - I want. - I like - I don't like. - It's none of your business. Leave me alone. Now, what are the sentences that are mostly used by parents? - Sit straight. - Behave. Now, does any one of you deny saying these words daily? You're not children and most of you are not parents. Abou Abdo, don't you often use expressions such as "I don't want" "I don't Like", "I don't feel like." No, I use them daily. Mawla, don't you always use expressions such as. "Sit straight"."Behave". I mean giving orders. Ok, So this is the role of authority. We all have it because we all had parents. And we have the role of the child because we all were children. Right? The role of the child remains in us it doesn't fade away. Now, there is an important role we didn't mention. It may also be present in our lives but we unfortunately don't reveal it at all times. What do you think this role is? I mean reacting within limits. - The peaceful. - The mature. - The adult. - The one who does not attempt to control. - The one who respects himself. - The one who has experienced life. Good, so let us call it the role of the adult. For a long time I've been considering myself as an adult. So, when you started this session I thought to myself I am adult enough and I shouldn't listen to such a thing. Later, I was surprised to discover that I'm not even an adult. My understanding of adulthood was so different than the one you have been talking about I discovered that I'm not even an ordinary kid I'm a confused kid who doesn't even know that he is a kid. The role of the adult was never really present in my life. Maybe just in 5% of my whole life. But until now the child's role is dominating "I want this". "I want that". "I like"... Until now. - Where does this attitude lead you? - The role of the child? It leads to problems selfishness, failure, egoism. First, I was taking my life for granted I was led by my desire I didn't care for anything. Prison made me discover responsibility I didn't have a fulfilling childhood I mean I've lived my childhood for a very short time I didn't live the role of the child as it should be. Many circumstances prevented me from living it. I've played the role of parents at a very young age when I shouldn't have played it I've played the role of the mother while I shouldn't have I lost my father at a very young age I had to be the parent and take care of my siblings. This parent role has taken much of my life I reached a point where I played the role of the parent instead of enjoying my childhood I was busy taking care of my siblings Until... I lost myself I so wanted to achieve things in life. All in all, I've spent my whole life giving and never taking. What Dear? You're that of a coward? How dare you sit with us? Vote guilty like the rest of us? And just because some golden-voiced preacher tears your heart out with the story of a kid who couldn't help becoming a murderer. You change your vote? If you are that emotional and caring. Why don't we collect some money for the kid? - How dare you talk to me like this? - How dare you change your vote? Who do you think you are? Stop it people! He is an edgy man Take it easy! Edgy? I am edgy? - Aha! Isn't it better? - Big difference. Can you embody this character for a while? It should be fun! This role is not related to you in anyway. Walk around with more energy. You're a show off you believe your own lies I mean you're in the jury room and 6 ladies at least are waiting for you outside and waiting for you like crazy! "I want Mustafa!" - "I want Mustafa!" - Oh Gosh! This is number 12! Number 12 speaks out loud to let everyone hear what he is saying. "Mustafa Zaiter!" "Oh! Hi. I've seen you outside" "How are you?" "Hello! How are you?" "Hi!" Haven't you ever seen such people? Beirut is "FULL" of them! I don't see such people! I swear to God. If I ever see them I would shoot them on the spot. Give me one sentence you like in French. - French!?? Are you kidding me? - You're telling a girl "Je t'aime Sophie". - What? - "Je t'aime Sophie". "Je t'aime Sophie." My friends between my pages hidden in the words and they've stayed there. All were executed Who is left? All are gone. My friends between my pages hidden in the words and they've stayed there. All were executed Who is left? All are gone. I used to think that conscience is a weapon and Justice always wins. Whose conscience is calm while tormenting human beings? I used to think that conscience is a weapon and Justice always wins. Whose conscience is calm while tormenting human beings? God did not create us as wolves We are human beings. God did not create us as wolves We are human beings. God did not create us as wolves We are human beings. - "I want to remind you" - I want to I want To "I want to remind you that this man walks very slowly and they helped him to sit." They HELPED him can you say They HELPED him? - "They helped him to sit down" - Repeat the sentence. - "I want to remind you" - "I want to..." Stop it man! - Leave him alone. - All of you want to interfere. - Let him say it. - Why are you getting upset? It's OK. Listen, when three or four people interfere at the same time the person won't know what to say anymore he'll be confused whoever he is. - Even me. - He needs someone to help him. But William you trust yourself. Of course I trust myself but too much too much noise makes me angry. Why don't each one of us take care of his role and stop bossing around on others! At 12:10 midnight exactly on the night of the crime, he heard noise coming from the apartment above. He said it sounded like a fight. Then he heard the boy shouting "I want to kill you". Few seconds later he heard the sound of a body falling. He ran to the door of his apartment. Opened it and saw the boy running down the stairs. Then he called the police and they found... - THEN he called the police. - "On the night of the crime" "he heard noise coming from the apartment above." "He said it sounded like a fight." You should be more bored! - THEN. - "Then". - NO! THEN. - "Then". NO! THEN "THEN he called the police and they found the father stabbed in his chest." "These are the facts We cannot deny them." "This boy is guilty There's no doubt about that." Personally, I'm sentenced for 15 years I do have a number. But may God help those who don't have a number. Those who don't know which year or which day they will be out. They have been here for 18, 23 and even 25 years. They have no clue when they will leave. We hope that life sentence will have a determinate length. This way, they can at least know till when they are staying. They would know they will be out after 25 years instead of just sitting here and thinking of suicide. Let's not talk about others I'll tell you about me. When I knew I was sentenced for 15 years I said to myself "My life is over!" I'd rather hang myself I have to wait for 15 years? 18 years are not easy I forgot the people living outside and people forgot about me. Nobody remembers me other than my parents I mean my mother and brothers but especially my mother. So I'm cut off the outside world even in the simplest ways I only have one thing in my mind. How will I be executed? Today? Tomorrow? Is it my turn or not yet? Will there be any execution soon? It grows so strong that I feel my mind entrapped in this one thought and paralyzed. Life sentence is a slow death unlike death sentence which is a quick death. Life sentence is to see someone who was a kid when you last saw him coming to visit you with his own kid. Life sentence is to review your life tens and hundreds of times from the day you were born and struggle with your own self. Life sentence is to regret every moment of freedom that the victim has lost before regretting your own lost freedom. Life sentence is wishing you were the victim and not the murderer. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Not guilty. - NO WAY! - Who the hell changed his vote? There we go! Another brainless fellow! The human being lives here as a mere body. Thinking is forbidden. Building relationships is forbidden Feeling human is forbidden. Everything around me is dead. Everything is still. You cannot talk about anything important to anyone around you. The life of a prisoner is nothing but eating, drinking, gossiping dealing with administrative issues. One day we're allowed to do this One day we're not allowed to do that. Honestly, it's a miserable routine. Life in prison is difficult It's difficult for any person even for those with a zero IQ. Of course zero would be considered a number. Damned be the prison and its bars. Away from daylight Away from loved ones. Oh prison, great school and revealer of true friends write on the pages of our past. How many friends we had before being put behind your bars and now they've all forgotten about us. The prison is full of negative things. There is no reform There is no rehabilitation. There is punishment that is below the level of humanity. The timing of the project was perfect for me I was able to rebuild contact with society. Concerning me personally, I can tell you that I was on the verge of despair I had almost called off the idea of pursuing my university studies. What would university give me after I had lost 5 years of my life here? I was thinking "this time I will sell drugs in a smarter way" I was serious about this and was willing to do it better than before earn money and just live. This project has given me back my self-confidence and has shown me that I can be successful in other ways. Before the project, I was thinking how I could build myself more like a mafia I mean the phone numbers good contacts. Just like a mafia I was working secretly to conduct some big deals and secure my future. But when the project started I changed a lot. It will change I swear to you man things will change. This life is rough on me and I know it's rough on you too. This life is rough on me and I know it's rough on you too. Believe me if I tell you that there is not one "Lira" in my pocket. Believe me if I tell you that there is not one "Lira" in my pocket. Damn this living everything is forbidden and banned. Damn this living everything is forbidden and banned. Before this project, I used to stay up late till 5 AM and sleep till 5 PM. While in the room They used to come and tell me. "Hey! Hawillo! The veranda is open!" No! I'm asleep. "Hey! Hawillo! You have visitors." Hmmmm give me 5 minutes I'll put on my clothes and come. Now whenever they say Zeina Daccache is here I run and almost wear my clothes outside the room. Why? I don't know! For some reason I am attracted to come here to see the guys, to see something new. It changed the routine that we are living It added something to our life. What was your routine? Tell me. Veranda, room, veranda. Hurry up prisoners! When she came we started to meet here all together. There were a lot of guys I didn't know I got to know them through the theater project I knew most of them. But never spoke to them. But now there is a big interaction between us. I expected hostility and problems because each one comes from a different background, confession... Each one will have a say and there will be clashes. But, I found out that this project has unified the group of 45 men. All as one I was never part of a team I've always played it solo. In prison I discovered what team work is. I am in Prison and you're doing just fine. This is not a good start. Guys unfold your arms! You should stand straight to let the air get into your lungs. Guys your voice needs air. Don't fold your arms Son, do not fold your arms. You should breathe well Come on! Sing! It would be nice to add some feeling to it. - Listen please! Guys. - Listen to Major Mrad. It's better to add feeling because some words are touching. When you say Your Judgment has burned me Dear Judge. It's nice It's enthusiastic. No problem with it. But in other parts you should add more feeling you shouldn't be shouting all the time. - True. - I know you can never imagine my pain. We should feel how sad this sentence is. - Live the lyrics. - Right! You are short of breath at some points and we don't get the end of the sentence. Your Judgment has burned me Dear Judge I am in Prison and you're doing just fine. Your Judgment has burned me Dear Judge I am in Prison and you're doing just fine - I'm planning just like a free man. - Continue I'm planning just like a free man I'm planning and learning to become more criminal I'm planning and learning to become more criminal I know you can never imagine my pain I know you can never imagine my pain. Yes good! First, I joined the project because I wanted to act and I liked the play. But later we told you about the music and I've always written songs even before prison. So I started working on the songs. The songs I made were inspired from the text of the play I got inspired by some sentences. Dear homeland, how noble you are. Glory is inscribed in your green fields. Your name is recognized in all places. You master forgiveness You master anger. Oh homeland, Oh homeland, Oh homeland. TOOOP They are late. Where are they? Rawad! Rawad! Where is Rawad? Where is Rawad? - He's inside the Building. - He went to the bathroom. Great! And we're starting without Rawad!! Rawaaaad! Rawaaaad! - Are we waiting for the bus here? - Rawaaaad! Kid? What did you say? I said K-I-D: KID. Because I'm trying to put some order here? This is my chair. Take it I'll just keep my mouth shut. Try it! - Don't make a fuss out of it! - Don't make a fuss out of it!? - What is it with you? - Are you making fun of me? We Repeat. We repeat! Guess why we need to repeat? Nidal did not start correctly You started wrong Nidal! Nidal! Nidal! Please memorize! Memorize your lines. Memorize the remarks I've given you. It's not the first time I tell you. Let us start again with number 8 "Stop acting like a kid!" - Kid? What did you say? - Are you making fun of me? Forget it fella! It's unimportant. Unimportant? Here you try it! I have no doubts in your capacities Please have a seat. He's right, indeed, he is right! Let's get done with it! Whose turn is now? Stop! I want to stop! Can't you control yourself and stop eating for few minutes Nidal? Especially that you're the one always telling me. "Zeina, get rid of anyone who does not commit?" How can YOU do this? You are delaying the work of 11 people here. They are repeating and waiting over and over again! That's it! Why don't you all handle it!! Today, two are absent and then she saw you eating during the rehearsal. That's it! We've been rehearsing all day and we're tired. So, the problem is not you! You know she counts on you. You help her with the guys You're committed to the work. You're always present. Come on, understand her! Even if she shouted, don't take it personal Take it easy! - No man! - See? Come on! Wait! What I want you all to realize is that we still have 3 months 3 months is all we got. Whoever feels that he cannot commit to the rules that I will be repeating now very clearly. Would rather say from now "I cannot commit". It's unacceptable that one person hinders the progress of 45 people achieving a first-time project. It's not acceptable to say: "Today I don't feel like coming to the rehearsal." "Today, I'm not coming because X is not coming." "Today, I changed my mind, I wanna stop" I'm telling you I can't work like this. We'd rather stop. I cannot achieve this project all by myself I just can't do it. Especially that the stress in the coming 3 months is much more than what we've been through. The stress of the play The stress of formalities. The stress of authorizations. The stress to get the clearance for your parents to watch you. The stress to get the inmates to watch you. This is to name a few. We wish to accomplish this project properly to have similar ones in the future. Commitment is all you can do to help. Test one. Test. Test one. You'll see 12 angry MEN not LEBANESE, 12 MEN. Because when Zeina wrote the project in 2006 she didn't know that she will be dealing with an angry Iraqi, an angry Egyptian an angry Syrian, an angry Palestinian an angry Nigerian, an angry Bangladeshi. They didn't know how to get angry in their own countries so they came to express their anger here. I won't mention this in my intro You will handle it. You get my point? Let's go through them all now. You're repeating yourself sometimes Youssef. When you say "We've told you we are 12" "but in fact we are 20 actors and 45 in total." Here you will have to add... And one of the guys told you once "If you don't choose me, I will kill you". Actually you once told me "Listen, I'm a criminal, I will kill you!" - No! It wasn't me! - So write it! "Though we told you the title of the play is 12 Angry Lebanese." And though we are all in all 40 Angry Men. Still, in reality, there are 7000 angry prisoners in Lebanese prisons. The problem of the prison in Lebanon... I asked a lot about Roumieh prison I'm curious about everything. So, when Roumieh prison was built in 1962-1963. It was the best prison in the Middle East built for 1000 prisoners. They didn't know it will become overcrowded. Prison is a different world. There is no place to sleep I slept near the toilets I used my shoes as a pillow. I covered myself with a mop. Where are human rights? Attention, attention to the sergeants and chiefs of all three floors. Sergeants and chiefs of all three floors. Please open the cells for the theater guys. Please open the cells for the theater guys. - Yes, try it. - Does it fit Ma'am? Wow! Ma'am, your thong is very nice! - Try these also. - What is this? Lipstick? Wow! Earrings. Look at me. Show me the ring. Director! Director! Director! She likes show off Don't hide it. Let me see how you do it. - Please director! Please! - Yes! Yes! That's the spirit! These are perfect untearable stockings! "Director! Director! Please!" You should see the ring. - Not like that! - "Director! Please!" You should say it louder. "Director!" Yeah, yeah! As if you're short of breath Come on! "Director! Please! Please!" I fear this project won't be followed by others and that we would go back to oblivion after it. This year I went out of this oblivion world. And I wish we would never go back to it. The audience will be afraid of us when they will come here. It's normal, some people have never been inside a prison. They will be afraid of us because we are prisoners. Director? Where is the director? Director? Yes, Ma'am, what is it? Where is she? Yes, Ma'am, what is it? I want to go to the bathroom to do Pipi. I want to go to the bathroom to do Pipi. Ma'am, we've said before the beginning of the show that nobody is allowed to leave during the show, I'm sorry. - Are all these prisoners? - Excuse me? - Are all these prisoners? - You mean the actors? Yes, they are. - So they are criminals? - Hmmm, yes prisoners. And you think this doesn't make a woman want to go to the toilets? - Excuse me!!! - You are scared, Ma'am? Yes, I'm so scared. - Sick? Means we can't take it anymore. - Yeah, it means we're sickened. No, the meaning is we've had enough tears. I confess! How do you say it? - I admit! - And I admit! I've worked with enthusiasm all year long I don't know why these last couple of months I've been nervous and confused. And it's her fault! I don't blame anyone else. When we have a monologue. When we have a monologue we start the rehearsal. Then, she goes "Liar. I do not believe you. Say it again". Sometimes, she makes us repeat the monologue 70 times. She tells us "Don't depress me". And she is depression itself. Basically, a part of this human being called Zeina Daccache is now living in each one of us. She has changed us indeed. We used to be nothing but prisoners. Now we feel freedom somehow. - They feel freedom. - Yes, we do feel freedom. - He's a liar. - No, it's the truth. It's not a tragedy calling Zeina Daccache "Abu Ali". Because she truly is "Abu Ali". She walks like "Abu Ali". Speaks like "Abu Ali". Using manly words. This is how the nickname was given to her and we hope that she will always be "Abu Ali" I'm honored to have this name indeed! It has wiped out my progeny I won't have any children. Anyway, no man would dare to approach me in this case. Calling a girl "Abu Ali" means she is terrifying. I often told the guys Zeina cannot put up with all this. We are guys, she is a girl. We cannot overburden her You have to bear with her. God be with her. She runs from office to office meets with colonels, officers and sergeants to sign papers, formalities, etc... Then, after the hassle she arrives here exhausted and we start asking her: "Zeina, did you sign that paper for me?" and Zeina goes crazy. We are 45 people here she cannot pamper each one of us. We are prisoners and she's a girl. We were born and we grew up with no one around to teach us right. We were born and we grew up. We were born and we grew up with no one around to teach us right. We were born and we grew up with no one around to teach us right. In war, poverty, fire and hunger we were born in this suffering country. In war, poverty, fire and hunger we were born in this suffering country. Have mercy on us we've had enough tears and I admit we went wrong. We were born and we grew up with no one around to teach us right. We were born and we grew up with no one around to teach us right. In war, poverty, fire and hunger we were born in this suffering country. In war, poverty, fire and hunger we were born in this suffering country. Have mercy on us we've had enough tears and I admit we went wrong. I started to hunt for fast money I wanted a better motorbike and so and so I wanted a better gun to show off. Then, I started drug dealing. But at first I didn't need to start drug dealing I could have made it without drug dealing. But I've been involved in drug dealing since I was a teenager. Family conditions have led me to live on the streets since I was 12. It made me follow militias and political organizations. There were militias back then. But when they were dissolved I had to work for a living I had no other choice to survive. When we were outside prison the common way of expression was guns and chaos. We knew nothing about order, law and government. During that period I started drinking to feel better and forget about my problems. Until I reached the point of addiction. Problems and worries were increasing and I was drinking more. At this stage, I committed the rape. I am not telling this or the summary of my life to justify myself. I know that I'm guilty and I deserve to be in prison. But maybe if someone had looked after me when I was a child I wouldn't have been in prison today. You should be wilder. Do it this way! Freeze. Jamil where are you? Stop. Two weeks before the show. My attitude was affecting the progress of the work. The rehearsals, the time frame "I want that" and "I want this". In other terms I became an obstacle to the project I was delaying the project and we were running out of time I worked for one year and one month and still had two weeks to go before the opening. Zeina had to take a decision and put me out of the project. Zeina, you're going too far I didn't mean you Anwar! Calm Down! They are not dumb. Everyone got my point. - They are all talking to me at the same time - Everyone got my point. I'll tell you in plain words. All of you, calm down. When I arrive here whether Hussam is joking or not Cut the joke! We're not joking here. Hussam tells me "I'm not in the mood today". You cannot be moody. Full stop. Full stop I don't care if you think I've lost my mind You cannot joke with me. Got it? I begged her many times to let me in the show again. She told me: "You are more important than the show itself". At first, I didn't understand what she meant. She said: "You work to reach the peak but when you're almost there..." "you drag yourself down. You are afraid of success." These words made me think. I went over my life from age 4 until my current age, 36. Indeed, she was right about it As if she were a fortune teller. She knew about my whole life I reviewed my whole life at school, at work, and even at prison I always reach the peak and then drag myself down. First question. In your opinion how is this play beneficial for you? Since people now may see the prisoner in a different way and may come to the prison to watch the prisoners' work. This is a contact between the civil society outside and the prisoners. This has never happened before. In my opinion, it's good enough. It's more important than conveying a message to the judges or politicians. Thanks to the theater project I see people who come to us just like you now I've never seen people for 10 years No one comes here to know who we are. Or to know at least that prisoners are human beings I started feeling guilty when I saw that someone is taking care of me as a human being. Even in prison. Someone who respects and listens to me. My features have changed You sure noticed it I feel much better now. Now I have hope in life I'll tell you something. I mean... Before, I was dead and alive at the same time. The disadvantage of the play is that it has awakened our feelings. When your feelings are awake you become vulnerable. Personally I was often very irritated as I was feeling because of the project. - Nice. - But I had the strength to overcome it. This is the work. This is the goal more than the play itself. When you enter prison you lose the ability to feel. You disable your ability to feel. Talking about therapy I'm thankful that Zeina came here and helped me by therapy for a certain time. But when the project ends and Zeina leaves. Who continues the therapy? NOOOO! Mustafa Zaiter has been released? - Yes, he's gone! - NO! - NO! - Say it one more time. - NO! - Better leave before she commits suicide. - Mimo, an actor left! - He's gone. NO! William, he's gone! Number 12. Jocelyne, would you play number 12 and take Mustafa Zaiter's role? Are we all here? Where is everyone? Guys! "Abu Ali" is calling! Guys! Zeina, I can play the role if you want. I need you all to discuss few things together. Guys! Listen and stop talking. Are you aware that the opening show is next Saturday? Who's not aware of this and needs me to remind him? It's next Saturday. Count the days. - Next Saturday. - 10 days to the opening. And I still have to tell you. Sit down. Calm down. Stop talking. Respect! It's a shame! We're receiving nonstop phone calls. From civilians and foreigners who don't know a word of Arabic. They're begging for a seat to watch the play I can't even find one empty seat for them. No one is believing that you stayed in the project for one year. No one is believing that there will be no barriers between you and the audience. The project is not limited to you and me anymore. Your commitment and responsibility are now much more important than before I don't mean to scare you I really don't. Today, you started to change your image to the better. We don't want to ruin this. Not even for a second! Not even for a second! I hear millions of rumors saying that it won't work, that you will fail. That someone will fail you and that a last minute surprise will stop everything I believe that if YOU want to do the play we will do the play 8 shows as we have committed ourselves. After the first show, believe me. Although you're not ladies and I've never given birth. - It will feel like delivering a baby. - If God wills! But you got to have the same energy for every show as if it were the first. Now, I have an issue Mustafa Zaiter has left. I suggest Capo takes his role if he agrees. I suggest Capo takes his role if he agrees. Capo? What do you say Capo? Can you do it? You all come here with your hearts bleeding about slum kids and injustice. And the Dear Sir here starts telling you fairy tales. But the problem is not his tales. It's that you pussies are believing his bullshit. That's it! Don't interrupt me while I'm talking. Capo even if you do mistakes say it out loud. They all went through this. All of them. Who's in building B with him? There's only Ali in building B. Do you see him or not? There is also Abdel Sattar. Let him read the lines for him at night. Give me this knife. I need a volunteer. You? Go ahead. Attention guys, I will do it one time only. The boy is 15 centimeters shorter than you, right? Right, and even more! Watch carefully. Focus with me! Watch out! Watch out! - Are you crazy? - How dare you? It's not a big deal! Nothing happened. Right? Yes, nothing happened. Elie, what is the sentence that you say here? Up, down and inside Do you have any objection? Up, down and inside - I have nothing to add. - I have nothing to add. Yes say it to Elie "I have nothing to add". As if he was asking for your opinion But in fact, he didn't. - Up, down? - No, no, Capo watch me. Come on, we are just rehearsing now! It's ok, but you'd better do it with the right movements I'm sorry Be patient with me. Up, down and in the middle. - Inside. - Use his words: "inside". Up, down and in the middle I have nothing to add. "Inside". It's "inside". Up, down and inside I have nothing more to add. That's it! My attitude has changed a lot I've been heartless since the day I was born I'm a human being who had no heart. Now I have a heart, I have feelings. My mother sees me in a different way now I've always been Jamil the weak loser. I made her see that I've changed that I can achieve something and that I can be successful just like I used to be before addiction I used to be successful. It's not shameful to admit our mistakes. And bring people outside closer to us forgive us and live with us in peace one day and accept us as human beings. We need to set a clear program for the play along with the music. We'll start with the song: My Dear Homeland! I called it: The National Anthem. Ok? "He came home for his knife." "It's not nice to leave knives sticking in people's chests." - Say it again. - He will answer me: "Especially in daddy's chest!" Yes, say it again as number 12 would. "He came home for his knife." No! "He came home for his Knife". Come on, we're not acting now I'm just learning the sentences. Learn them the right way. "He came home for his Knife." - Yes! - Right? - Right! - I said it right. I'm an Actor now They will all love me, I'm sure. They will love you more if you know your role by heart. Really? "Ok, if nobody else has an idea I might have a good one here" "I didn't think about it much." "But I'll throw it out and see if someone picks it up!" "If someone picks it up?" - "Yeah. The boy" - "Sit down! Just sit down!" - Bravo! That's it! - I'm not that bad! Huh? I'm afraid and terrified I feel responsible. As if I was carrying 7000 prisoners on my shoulders. I spent the whole night in the toilet I'm terrified and happy at the same time I experienced this feeling once at school during examinations. And now I'm experiencing it again after 40 years. Bro, I didn't sleep all night long See what I mean? Yesterday I didn't care much but today it's totally different I didn't sleep Since yesterday, I honestly didn't sleep. They brought me from my building but I didn't sleep because I'm afraid. I was repeating everything in my mind during the night. Remember Sirs we are dealing with a first-degree murder charge. This means if we vote the accused guilty he'll be sentenced to death by hanging. - Ready? - Ready. Fine, all those voting guilty please raise your hands. - Guilty. - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 11 voted guilty. Those voting not guilty? Here we go again! There is always one who disagrees. Let your judgment be just Dear Judge. How good is Justice when it rules on all! Let your judgment be just Dear Judge. How good is Justice when it rules on all! Mercy is a higher virtue than Justice. Mercy is a higher virtue than Justice. This is God's will. This is God's will. We'll present to you now a scene about the law 463 the law for the reduction of sentences known as "The early release law" according to which the prisoner has the right to submit a request for reducing his sentence duration. This law was issued in 2002. We're in 2009 and till now the law has never been implemented. Let's imagine that it's being implemented and that a panel of judges was formed to look into the cases. We went down to the ground floor. I looked from the window and saw you standing near the door and smoking strangely and very fast. I wanted you to give me strength but you were more afraid than me. As the Arabic proverb says: "We sought Mr. Help to Help but he needed Help himself." I knocked on the window glass You came to the ground floor I asked you: "What?" You said: "What?" I said: "What?" You said: "What about you?" I said: "What about you?" We both had no idea about what was happening. The pressure was mounting a lot I wanted to pee I had to use two bottles before the show I filled them up. Both bottles became full I don't even know where all this water came from! Look at this invention. It's a knife. A real one. It's a very unusual knife I've never seen one like it. Neither had the storekeeper who sold it to the boy. What is this? Good evening everyone. Let me talk the way I want or I wouldn't talk! - Yes, yes, express yourself. - You ask me. Hawillo, what did you feel on the opening show? The first show was very hard for me I'll tell you why Because I was afraid I was afraid more than you can imagine I usually suffer from a 25% degree of trembling. But when I snooped from the curtain and saw all the people it reached 75%. Guys! Guys! Listen to me! Listen to me! If you open your mouth once more I'll knock your teeth out. Sit down! - What I was trying to say. - Sit down! I was very anxious and remained anxious the whole time. I was afraid afraid that we fail in what we are doing and that people will despise us. I'll finish my sentence in ten months but don't you think that another Prison is waiting for me outside? A prison without bars and without walls. Dear homeland, how noble you are. Glory is inscribed in your green fields. Dear homeland, how noble you are. Glory is inscribed in your green fields. Your name is recognized in all places. You master forgiveness. You master anger. Oh homeland, Oh homeland, Oh homeland. Oh homeland, Oh homeland, Oh homeland. I went up to the room after the show. And late at night I locked myself in the toilet... and cried. That's all. I was crying without knowing why. I cried my heart out. I don't know why. Maybe because I remembered my parents. And thought I shouldn't be in prison. Maybe because I saw people from outside watching us I wished I were in a different place. So I cried and the guys started crying with me. I wasn't believing until the next day. I didn't believe that the Minsiter of Interior President Mirza and President Tabet congratulated us in the backstage I didn't believe that they even asked about me personally. Seeing people cry has helped me. As for me, I didn't know what I felt I was happy and irritated at the same time. Irritated because for the first time I feel success I'm not used to success I was never able to accomplish anything. I always failed. Here, I'm in prison. I couldn't escape. I couldn't escape from success I had to face it. This play is a message to say that prison is a place of punishment for a crime that happened. However, punishment should not be double the conditions of the prison and the sentence itself. So I think the message today is that we can help improve the prisoner's life and attitude. The performance we've seen today is more than professional. The inmates were working wholeheartedly. This play has taught me that there is no way I can go wrong again! Because when you are good everyone loves you! Unfortunately, we are a wasted potential. As human beings we are more important than oil. If Lebanon takes care of its prisoners and invests in them through productive activities for the benefit of the society. Why do we remain idle and useless? We are meant to be productive I hope that by the end of this project some tangible, judicial results will be reached for the prison in general to comfort all the inmates and not only us. This show is the best of all since we started this journey. I'm very happy although my mom is late due to traffic. - She's on her way! - Let her in! Please! It's been 18 years since I last had this quality time with her. And I feel speechless!
