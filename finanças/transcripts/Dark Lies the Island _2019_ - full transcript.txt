My daughter wasn't the first one that lake turned into a spacer. There was a wicked auld draw for it always. Turned half the place crooked in the head. I thought I'd never escape it. I still don't know how much of me self I left back there. It mightn't look like it... ...but this is kind of a funny story. The way one thing led to another. And everything just went phenomenally fuckin' mental. What kind of a night did you have? Don't be talking to me. Had you nightmares? Wiggling around in my brain. Are you going to humiliate me, Sara? I am, yeah. This is Daddy Mannion. I married the man. I know, yeah. Tell me about it. You need to take her to the head doctor. You're not to leave me, Sara. Sure, where else would I be going at this fucking stage? The Mannions owned and ran this place always. Kept it in the family. So, did he have an aul' go off ya last night, did he? And how many times did you come? Martin Mannion. The younger of Daddy's two sons by the first aul' bat. God rest her. Poor Martin wasn't setting the world on fire. Mr Mannion? That's right, yeah. I'm from the Organic Certification Board. The older son was my true love. Doggy Mannion. Ah, come on to FUCK! Also known as 'The Dog-man'. October... Nineteen ninety... six. One thing you don't ask is how he got the fuckin' name. Nineteen ninety... October. Nineteen ninety...! Sara would've been... He believes the birds have plans for us. Sara would've been... What would she have been? He believes there are voices in the dark. Too much love in me heart. That's Doggy Mannion's only problem. And he believes in first love. The poor Dog-man. He couldn't even get out of his own fuckin' shack. You were warned! You're very talented, pet. But do you know what I mean, like? You going to make an appearance at the school today? I have the aul' headaches bad again. You've no temperature. But I'll tell you what I do have. What's that? Taste of metal in me mouth. Want to play with this? Broke. It's not broke, pet. Look. Look. I have no interest in the fucking thing. What kind of a child can't get herself addicted to the fuckin' internet? Me head is raw, Tee-Jay. Can you not give it a break? Smoking that gange morning and night. How's that gonna get us outta here? There's nothing gettin' us outta this place, Patcho. D'ya know what you are, Tee-Jay? A fatalist. Would ya not smoke a joint at least, no? I would not, Patcho, 'cause me body is a temple. I don't wanna go up there. I don't wanna go up there either. No choice, have we? Nine grand we owe the fucker. But what is it he wants us to do? Can I just be lookin' in the window at people? That's not gonna clear us nine grand of debt. It's surveillance, Tee-Jay. Anyhow, the Dog work in strange ways. Give it time; it'll wind up being more than looking in at people. I suppose. The problem with Doggy is... ...he can't leave the place on account of... ...his what-you-call-it? An acro-type cunt... An acrobat... He's an agrophobe, Tee-Jay. An acrobat is the cunt swinging himself off the ceiling. I don't care what the fuck he is! All I'm worried about is how we're gonna clear nine grand of debt! Sure, you'd have a man killed around this place for 500 euro. It's 400 in Mohill. You heard that said? In Mohill, they have a kind of a twist in the mind. Twist? Sure, didn't our own uncle set himself on fire up there. Oh Mulvihill's. Treated wrong always. How's business, Doggy? Hoppin' off the roads. Get into me! C'mon! She's back in the same bed as him? And was he interferin' with her? Could you see from where you were hid? Or you don't want to tell me? It's hard to say Doggy from the angle that we were at. I know she's your own cousin. You mightn't want to look... And, of course, the lights were out as well and... The lights? Aw, well! She wouldn't want to be looking at a big, ignorant ape like me father, would she? Mannion Introductions. Dog Mannion speaking. Hah? Okay. And the name? Okay, calm yourself and listen to me, Rachel. Mannion Introductions deals with clients of all shapes 'n sizes. What size of a girl are you exactly? And what class of a dress size would you take? Ah, for the love and hon our of Jesus, Rachel! Hold onto yourself and listen to me. I dealt with many's a 22 in me day and bigger again. Stop it. There's no call for tears now. Ah look...! I've a folder here... ...full of fellas whose tongues would be hangin' out of their heads for the size 22 of a dress size. I've a fella here; works in the forestry although I need to ask you a question, Rachel. Have you a strong sense of smell? He's not a bad-looking man by any means. Not saying he's an oil painting, but Jesus, God, Rachel, when you're hammering around the place in a size 22 of a dress size, it's not gonna be George Clooney landing in the door to ya and a waft of Nespresso off him! Was he interfering with her in th e bed last night? Honestly Dog, we didn't see. Hold for me there one minute, Rachel. Thank you. Mannion Bet wise. Dog Mannion speaking. Huh? No, I'm taking no more bets on the French dogs. I'll tell ya why. 'Cause it's crooked fuckers that's running the French dogs. Have a think about Clooney from the forestry and I'll come back to ya Rachel. I'll fuckin' tell ye boys. From the lake below there... ...across the woods up here, as far as the Curlews on the far side, as far as Mohill in the east, it's all fucked. It's all got the bad strain. How do you get a feel for this kind of thing, Dog-man? By paying attention to what's going on around me. By using me fuckin' eyes. By using me fuckin' ears. But you don't leave this place, Dog. By using me fuckin' feel, Tee-Jay. It's the bad strain that causes all the lies around here. A woman saying one thing and meaning another. Not calling your cousin a liar but... But if there's lies being told to me, someone needs to fuckin' bleed for it. You're to keep an eye on him for now. That Tess Maguire, it is? 'Tis, yeah. She's looking fabulous. Best she's looked for years, Phylis. You had the work to do. I had. Poor dear. Fucked herself into the lake. That can give the green bloat. Ah, she wasn't in there long enough for that. You've done her proud, Mr. Mannion. She have nice colour on her. It's the first bit of colour on that poor woman's face since... Since the days of ABBA and discos, Phylis. Poor Tess was 20 years dying. Brains o' the operation into ya. Lady o' the Maguires. You've her got out great. I've her got out like a hoor's breakfast, Martin. Sure, that's what they'd nearly be after, the Maguires. What are you doing here, Martin? I think the chickens are after going to fuck on me, Da. And what's after happening is... I'll tell you what you do so, Martin. Go out and ring Sky Breaking News and tell them there's shock developments in. Martin Mannion of Dromord is after making a pig's mickey of another business. Da. Listen. Through no fault of my own. I don't want to listen to it. Through no fault of my own! Changing regulations of organic certs and, And the way things are looking for me now, Could mean I have to go and lease a new... I won't listen to it, Martin. You're a half-wit. All you do is go around town following your lad. Says he and he took up with me brother's missus. Leave it! The town getting the whole of it's mouth, talking down Mannions like we're fucking pieces of shit! I took that girl off the roads! And your brother went out to a fuckin' shack in the woods. Was mad before he got there! We were respectable people. With me mother still warm in the grave, you went and you fuck in... Martin! Let me tell you the fundamental facts. The best part of you dripped down my leg. You're worse than useless. You had the deli and you ran it into the ground. You had your... what you call it? fuckin' gastro pub and you ran it into the ground as well. The tan shop went the same way. You must be the only eejit in the northwest region that couldn't make a go of a fuckin' tan shop and the cunts out there screamin' for a bit of colour on their faces. I've bailed you out again and again. And again. The bills you couldn't face. The loans you couldn't pay. And your mad brother above in a wagon in Dromord Woods and money horsin' in the door... From drugs and whores and robbed antiques and bettin'... At least he can make a count of it! So what you're saying to me basically, Da, is no. That's what I'm saying to you, Martin. Yeah. I don't believe in God. I don't believe in the devil neither. I don't believe in angels or ghosts. Or demons or any of it. You never know what the road will bring in. You never know what'll fall out of the sky. I think I had an appointment. Yes. Ah, yes. 11 o'clock - Mr Tobin. Richard, is it? Yeah. That, that's... Yeah. Mr. Mannion isn't actually here at the moment. He has an old dear to lay out. Lay out? Saoirse, hush, love. Do your sums. I might have what you're looking for, Mr Tobin. No school today, no? Taste o' metal in me mouth. Bad dose. I do. And I definitely have the leases here for ya, ready for signin'. I'm after buying a chipper! Super! The money is cleared; you're all set to go. The very best of luck to you now with everything, Richard. I think I might be Richie. Homework, is it? Fair play. A woman with a future. A man with a past. What the fuck?! St. Jarlath's Under-19s 1998 County Champions. The hoors haven't won it since. A lot of the lads are dying off now. Tommy Cryan drowned in a slurry pit. Alan Connellan turned a car over outside Ballymoate. Poor Phil Quelley had the cancer. Can ya pick Martin out? Mannion head on it! Heads like boiled hams! Always. Can ya pick me out? Dacent side, in fairness. They can't even kick a ball down there these days. Sure, all the lads are gone out foreign now. They are, and the cunts have Australia destroyed. Th-This, this place, you see... What it is, really, is, uh... it's the inside of my brain, you know? If I didn't have it pinned to the wall... ...I might lose it altogether. I know that. They want me to go to the head doctor. They say it runs in the family. There's no need for that. Listen to me. It's just the fear of it, d'ya know? They say things like, 'Madness, it runs in families.' Or heart attacks or cancer or... suicides, it runs in families. But often all that runs in families is just a fear of those things because they've happened before. Do you understand me? Maybe. And fear is the most powerful thing. If you let fear into ya, you can make a reality out of anything. Do you want to come outside? Huh? Do you want to come outside now? Come on, Doggy! It's been years since I've been down in that town. I'm sorry. She's asleep. I gave her a pill. Get into the bedroom now. Holy Mother of jaysus! What the fuck, Patcho?! Daddy's arse is white as the moon. Do you like humiliating me, Sara? I do, yeah. Mother of fuck! Whisht! Is it bigger than mine? Oh, there's no comparison. It's a wonder he can walk around the place at all. Will you bate me like the fuckin' weasel I am? Yes, Daddy. Doggy's gonna go fuckin' mental. You well, Dog? No point complainin'. Anything strange below? The whole fuckin' place is strange. How's the love life? Ah, nearly have it kept in a jar altogether now at this stage. You not steppin' out no more with that girl from the Lidl? What was it? Belorussian, she was? Svetlana. She was. That's all over. They make a fine tractor, the Belorussians. How are the chickens? I'm hearin' the cunts in me dreams. Why are you here, Martin? Look, what I was wondering, Dog, is, uh... Is there any chance you could help me out with the...? There wouldn't be, Martin. How many times have I bailed you out before? The fella that never visited me once when I was sick. It's all a long time ago now in fairness. It don't seem long to me. Dog. Maybe I can help you out, you know? Help me out? Against the aul' fella. Listen to me, Martin. We're the Mannions. We're the story this place tells itself. And what's between Daddy and me, it's like a tight line. It's like a length of wire held at tension. It has to be held fuckin' taut, you know? Because if either of us at either end lets drop, the whole fuckin' thing comes down! Sometimes I think, you know I've held onto it for too long. Maybe I might just let it all come down. I'll help you against him. I'll keep that in mind, Martin. Take me serious for once in your life! Look after yourself, Martin. You could come back, Dog. I could come back. You could bunk up with me below. Like when we were small? Who's madder? Me or you? Still doin' the two-fers over Monday? The what? Two snack boxes for the price of one. Where does it say that? You've a small amount of blood on your head there, fella. Sorry about that. Should a seen the buck who had the place before ya. Bit of a knock you got there at some point. Some fella come at ya with a hatchet? Haven't a fuckin' clue how it happened, lads. Richie, where are you? Please don't hurt yourself. You can't run away from this. You're not going to find her there. She's not coming back with you. I can't swim over And neither have I The wings to fly I wish I had. Is he alright? Ah, he'll be grand again in a while. My loving arms... One, two! One, two, three, four! Amazing Grace How sweet the sound That saved a wretch Like me I once... Mannion Introductions. Dog Mannion speaking. Oh, hello there. How are you getting on yourself? Not too great now in all honesty. I know the way. I know it only too well. Excuse me, are you at the Dew Drop by any chance? I believe I might be. That's Phylis Cryan behind ya. Doing her 'Amazing Grace'. You wouldn't be in the full of your health after Phylis. No, but um... Is Teddy Grehan in? Who? The little birdy-faced fella having a weep. Yeah, he's on a high stool. That's his perch. Makes a holy show of the place. What are you lookin' for? I, I'm sorry? Man or woman, dog or cat? I'm looking for a friend, I suppose. And what's your usual leaning? You must have some notion. I'll tell you one thing, though. I don't want anything to do with women with horses' tails! You're in the wrong neck of the woods, so! When was the last time you were with a woman? I don't know. I have folders here. Can you describe yourself to me? I'm an average size cut of a gentleman. Fella told me that once. Turned out to be 24 stone. Nearly flattened a poor girl from Boyle. I have scars. And, em, kinda wounds. It's very hard to describe yourself. I mean, how would you describe yourself? I was blind, but now I see. A fuckin' maggot. Ah now, come on. A fuckin' maggot that can't crawl out of its hole. Take it handy on yourself? 'I can leave whenever I want, ' she says. 'I can leave whenever I want, ' she says. 'I can leave whenever I want, ' she says. I can't. I can't fuckin' leave. I'm a pathetic fuckin' maggot who can't leave his fuckin' hole. You finding your feet? You'd have to be born into it to love it. The lake kind of makes it nice. As long as you don't fuck yourself into it. Wind up with the green bloat on ya. Good day. We've often put down worse. Mr Tobin, is it? Is right. Mannion Auctioneers. Oh right. I was going to call in to see you, actually. I, eh, I was just wondering, do you know how it came about? How it happened? Me buying the premises? I'll tell you straight now, son. The last thing this place needs is another lunatic with his head gone quare. Things happen 'cause they happen, son. You're here in this godless hole of a place. Deal with it. I have to see you, Sara. Ah, don't mind the aul' bollock-talk now. Sara, listen. Is this a life, do you think? That I'm having? You're depressed, Martin. This isn't the answer. I'm in love with you, Sara. Love! You're an adult! Act it! Stop going around the place trying to convince yourself of nonsense. Sara, I'll hurt myself. Don't put this on me! I'm up to me eyeballs with Mannions! This is done with! It's the answer to nothing! I'll tell him. I'll tell him. You'll tell him what? I'll tell him about us. Martin, do one thing for me now, okay? Turn around and fuck off. There was a tiny island out there. Me self and the Dog would go out there drinkin'... ...when we were kids. Nothin' out there, but it was a magic place. Sometimes I just want to go back out there again. Bottle of vodka, packet of fags. And feel the way I felt when I was 17. I don't want you lookin' like a badger neither, Dog, you know what I'm sayin'? I won't look like a badger. Lash it on goo do. Your skin's looking a bit better. I haven't been scratchin' so much. Good man. Haven't had the rash so bad on me arm neither. That'd be a great ease to you. Damon Albarn, watch your back! I missed you last week. I can't come every week. He has funerals out the ears this week, it was handy. How's his blood pressure? Don't be jerkin' around the place, that dye will float. Remember that song from the Debs, do ya? Doggy. You're goin' to have to let it all go at some stage. You know that, don't ya? Why? You might take a seat for me there, Martin. And what, why? Now Martin. Daddy, what are you doing here? You rode your own stepmother. Jesus Christ. I'm sorry, Daddy. You showed your colours, Martin. Now get in the chair before I'm dug from ya! You might use that as a gag for me. I don't want you to swallow your tongue. Please, Daddy! Please, Daddy! Please, Daddy! I'm going to dislocate your shoulder now, Martin. It'll give you something to remember the night by. I'm gone old-looking now. You're not gone old-looking, Doggy. It's just that me, me self-esteem is in a bucket, you know? Shush, would ya? You mean it? Would you lie to me, Sara? I'm gonna have to go home. Doggy! Tell me again how it'll work out for us. He won't live forever. And it'll be just you and me? That's all. Are you back, are you back in the same bed as him? Doggy, stop. 'Course I'm not. If you're lying to me, Sara... Ah Doggy! You don't need me to leave this place. You know that, don't you? You can leave whenever you like. Patcho, are we gonna send the video to the Dog-man? It's the proof he was after; that she was doing the dirt on him. Ah but, Patcho, can you imagine where it sends him? In the mental stakes! I mean, you can make out the brother as well. Holy Mother of jaysus! What the fuck, Patcho! Daddy's arse is as white as the moon. When you think about it... ...she's doing the brother and the father at the same time. Effectively. Very effectively... ...by the looks of it. Rough day? Yeah. Bag of chips, please. Thanks. What's wrong with your shoulder? It's dislocated. I think I can fix that for ya. Huh? No, no. What do you mean, 'fix it'? Are you sure you know what you're doing? Give me your hand there now. And you're going to take a deep breathe for me, and just hold it for me. There's nothin' wrong that can't be put right again. I'd say you kept some rough company in your day. I wouldn't put it past me self. Send the video now, Tee-Jay. Holy Mother of jaysus! What the fuck, Patcho! Daddy's arse is white as the moon. Is that the brother on the computer, Patch? She's gone, Richie. You're to stop goin' up there. It could be the finish of him and you know it. I don't give a fuck no more what happens to him, Sara. Don't go cruel on me! Is she still up? How are we now? It's a little bit different to the old house, Daddy. Doggy, listen to me, there's a child in the house. You lied to me, Sara. And I can't hear your voice now. Okay? Sit down. Everything is fuckin' ruined! He can't do one thing right in his life because of you. You fucked it all up! Our mother, why did she fuck herself in the fuckin' lake? Why did she die? Why didn't you fuckin' die, huh? She fucked herself in the lake cause she's fuckin' mad, Dermot. Don't fuckin' say that! I'm only tellin' ya the fucking truth, Dermot. I told you not to call me that. I know she goes down to ya. I know her routine. She does your hair. She brings ya vitamins. She brings ya skin cream. Because she knows you're mad, Dermot. Don't call me that again! It's your fuckin' name, Dermot! You're a fuckin' Mannion! Didn't I wet the head on ya me self. Doggy. Doggy, listen to me. Shut up! I was 19 years of age and you left me to rot in the fuckin' mental... ...because you were ashamed of what I said for the family name. Eight months walkin' that corridor and did you come and visit me once even? Did me brother come visit? Was he let? He didn't want to go. Was I let out for me mother's funeral? You'd have jumped in the grave after her. You remember when I did get out, Daddy? I was 19 years of age and I went down to that lake in the middle o' the night. And put myself into the water. I didn't want to be taken out of it. 'Cause you know what it felt like, the water? A fuckin' kindness. And then I'd be down there with Mammy at least. You could have had a life! You had the brains for it. You could have had the run o' this town and not be stuck in a wagon up the Dromord wood! Why'd you lie to me? So you wouldn't go and fuckin' top yourself! Stop it, leave him alone! Fuck you! Daddy, leave him! Are you fucking savages altogether?! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Get off him, Doggy. Martin! Oh for God's sake! Jesus, Martin, let him go! Me own fuckin' brother! And you went at her! For fuck's sake! We were respectable fuckin' people at one time, the Mannions. Martin, you're a fuckin' half-wit. You're from your mother's side. And you, you'll be back in an institution, only this time, you'll die in it. You don't think there's been enough tonight! Hold your lip, you! I'm warning ya. You're warnin' ME? Remember who you are. And what you are. What's that supposed to mean? You're a Mulvihill. I know what you came from. Watch your mouth now. I rode your whore mother in 1992 and two of your three whorin' aunts. If I didn't ride the one with the bockety leg, It's because I didn't have the charity in me fuckin' heart for it. Fuck you! Fuck you! Saoirse! When I am laid Am laid In earth May my wrongs create No trouble No trouble In thy breast Remember me Remember me But ahhhhhh! Forget my fate Remember me But ahhhhh! Forget my fate. Look there's nothing we can do. We're going to have to phone the guards. Is his head bad? It's not good. Sweetheart. We're all in shock now, but we're gonna have to think this through. Will the lake look after him? Love, I know you're upset, but we have to face a reality now. Yourself in the women's jail? And I'm doin' what? Smuggling the Pinot fuckin' Grigio into you? The child's right. If he's long enough in the lake, the green bloat kicks in. He must have slapped his head off a rock and he throwin' himself in. And, you know, God help us, he hasn't been great in himself. This last long while. What are ye like? Mannions! I tell ya one thing he don't look... peaceful. Easy, easy! For fuck's sake! Hush, Daddy, hush. What are you doing? Hah? The man's dead as a stone. Who ya tellin'! Isn't he cold and clammy up against me face! Doggy, this thing now, I don't think we can do it. We have to. Listen to me, we owe it to Sara. And we owe it to Mammy. Yeah, let's do it. Do you think it will feel different without him? Bit too early to tell. Doggy! Dog-man! Patcho, listen to me. Imagine what he have in there! Patcho! It's our ticket out of this place. Wave it goodbye, Thomas John! Woo hoo! Shit! I never noticed that before. What? Dromord... it reads the same backwards as forwards. Yeah, it does, yeah! Reflects itself. It's a palindrome. I don't care what the fuck it is. It reads the same backwards as forwards. There's a place up in the hills. Up in the Dromord wood past Doggy's old shack. And when you're high enough, you can see the entire town reflected in the lake. Every last stone and brick of it. And it makes me wonder, what if we're only the reflection? What if the real town is down there in that black water? These now would be the executive homes, you know? Oh right. Three-beds, four-beds, underfloor heatin', double-glaze aluminium, keep the wind off ye. Intelligent lighting. More brains than me self, the lighting. Open-plan kitchen spaces, Scandinavian, how-are-ya, and washin' machines that'd nearly talk to ye. And what's it going to be called, the estate? The, em... 'The Lake View'. It's the way we're thinkin'. Cor, the cops! You never had a cheekbone in your life, Maggie, but you're getting one now! Hey good lady He just wants what you got, you know He'll never stop until he's taken the lot Hey, hey, hey, hey Hey, hey, hey, hey Gonna stamp out your fire, he can change your desire Don't you know he can make you forget you're a man Gonna stamp out your fire, he can change your desire Don't you know he can make you forget you're the man You're a man You're twistin' my melon man, you speak so hip.
