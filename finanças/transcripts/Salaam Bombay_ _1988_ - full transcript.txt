Hey, Moti, get ready! We're off. Krishna, the boss is coming. Who the hell's going to work, your father? Run to town. Buy three big tins of Ganesh paan masala. Make damn sure it's Ganesh. None of your tricks. A ticket to the nearest big city. Pay up. Which city? Bombay. Come back a movie star! Where are you going? My queens, where are you off to? Salaam, king of Bombay fuckers. Move, move! Move, move! Move fast. Move! Move fast! Move fast! - Give me my paan masala! - What? it's all meaningless. Will you give it to me? Om, peace, peace, Om Hurry, let's go. A policeman is coming. My paan masala! Tea-boy! Tea! Yes, yes. More to the left. Don't you get it? Left! - Baba, tea. - Where's Chillum? Don't know. Find him. Send him here. Chillum! Salim, you owe me money for yesterday's tea. Bumpkin, look down, the sack shouldn't fall. Hey, Salim! - At least let me have my tea. - Pay me for the tea. Get off! You want money for the tea! Where is 109? Take it easy. Let's go inside. Take it. Here's your money. From where have you come? Don't speak Hindi? Don't worry. You'll soon learn it all. Isn't she lovely? So fair? She's new. Why are all of you here? Isn't there any work in the house? Out, all of you! Out! Here, drink some. Tea's gone. Glass gone, too. There's a glass missing. It broke, Chacha. I told you, if anything gets broken, you've got to pay. Chacha, how much have I saved up? Wasting your life on the streets. You should be studying! You've saved 5 rupees a day. That makes 150. Minus 10 for the teas your pals drink. Minus 2 for the glass you broke. So, 12 rupees cut. How long will it take to save 500? Saving up for your wedding? It'll take a long time. Now go! Tea-boy, too much water in the tea. What can I do? There's water everywhere. See, the man runs... steals something and runs. Look, Ma. Look, he has come on time. Put the tea here. Sit in the chair. Take your shirt off. Manju, pass me the towel. Take that shirt off. Why are you feeling shy? I've seen many in my time. Ma, look. My song! My name is chin chin choo In the moonlight and you Hello, mister, and how do you do? Hi, my Sridevi. Princess of my dreams. I knew it. You'd never let me down. You know what Chungal said? There's a new girl in 109. A sexy, very fair number. Sexy. So what? You'll see. Like Mandakini, she'll change soon. Come boys, push it in harder Come boys, push it in the car Move it, boys, push it in far Know what this Bumpkin said? "Here, have some." I'm not playing. I'll take you with me. I'll show you how to keep the girls happy. What's up? Hey, lnsect! Shut up! Got money? I'm feeling lucky today. Saving it up? You're rich. Can't you give me a loan? Me? Rich? I need to save 500. Chacha cut 2 rupees. The new girl broke a glass. New girl? So, you've lost your heart? No, man. How old is she? 15? 13? 14? - 16? - 16. Sweet Sixteen, slick name! Out with the money! Give me the money! Let me see how many you have. You already owe me some. Give it back. Champ, for this fiver, I'll show you the Taj Mahal. Tell anyone, and I'll slit your throat. State Bank, Chillum Branch. The bank's empty, but not for long. You, Bumpkin, you be the manager. Keep your money here. Safer here than with that crook Chacha. Full-time safe! Thank you, boss. O whore of my dreams, when will you come to me? Rafique Bhai said you had work. Clean the place. You'll get 3 rupees each. Who is she? - Sweet Sixteen. - What a stupid name! Shut up, runt! Why are you hollering? We've paid, just like you. We'll do as we please. England? Which land? America. - Coke, coke? - No coke. Where is sir from? From New York. One path taking, flying Air lndia. - How much? - 250. - Too much. - Too much? No, man! - Not 250. - Okay. For you... special price. - 150. - Why not? - Give some to your brother, okay? - Thank you. Salaam, Hashim Bhai. A man who doesn't smoke hash is like a man without balls. Isn't that right? Not so hard the first time, big boy. I ripped off a white boy. So I said, "Let's celebrate." Thought I'd show Bumpkin here the real thing. Not Baba's trash. You scared? Why did you do that? I want to go back. Come on. We've come so far, and you want to go back? Give me your hand. Hey, Chillum, the sky's spinning. Let the fucker spin. Sit down. This is the granddaddy of all poisons. Sometimes my heart tells me... I should swallow rat poison... and sleep for the last time. All the end. Why don't you give it up? You won't understand. Once it gets you, it won't let go Not until you die Not until you're dead That fat foreigner! You were as green when you first got here. Do you remember that day? When did you come to Bombay? It's ancient history, kid. I forgot. How could you? I was half your size when I ran away from home. When I was that high, I had seen all of lndia three times. By train, ticketless. Up, down... left, right... And then? Forget it. Why spoil a good high? So, you think... you can go back to the sweet village air? Of course! As soon as I have my 500. What's this business about 500 rupees? You know, my brother lied to my mother about me. He said I stole his money. He beat me when he felt like it. When Father died, he became a big boss. I got pissed off. He was a mechanic. He came home with a client's bike. I set it on fire. Ma said I couldn't stay home anymore. You sneaky bastard! Then? Ma took me to the circus... and left me there. She said: "Don't come back until you have 500 for your brother." I said, "Fine. "In a month and 17 days, I'll save 500 and go back home." You stupid ass! You'll get burnt someday. Forget them all! Mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, friends... lovers, Sweet Sixteen... Useless bloody lot. Me, too? Aren't I your friend? Chillum has no friends. Mind your own business, or else... Or else? The Chiller Room? What's this Chiller Room? Want to see it? No problem. I'll hand you over to a cop. He'll show you Chiller Room air. You'd never do that to me. You've shown me paradise. How many times must I tell you? When I'm working, get lost! - Scratching the door like an alley cat! - No, I wasn't. Now, what's wrong with this fuse? Ma, Chaipau doesn't play with me. Nobody does. He gave Sweet Sixteen the baby chicken. He didn't give it to me. No one plays with me. My heart, my sweet baby. No one plays with you? I'll play with you. Want to hear a story? Once upon a time, there lived a dog... and a butterfly. She'd fly here, she'd fly there. The bad dog wanted to eat her up. - And the butterfly? - She'd fly here and there. She flew away! The lights are back. We had such fun in the dark. We saw a butterfly and a dog. Manju, scram. Remember the last time the lights went out? Remember what we did? My child sleeping with riffraff. Hey, Bumpkin. One tea here. I'll pay. Prince, they're getting your virgin ready. Where were you? Can't come when you're sent for? Getting smart, boy? Your days are numbered. Got your money. Know Padmini in 103? No. Why? She died of an overdose. Really? I didn't know. You should know. I see you sell on this street, you're dead. Scum, you know the rules, don't you? Me? Sell Baba's drugs on Baba's street? I don't do local business. I only sell to foreigners or to fools who say, as they die: "Thank you, Baba." Back off. This is my last warning. Okay, Boss. Bastard! And you? Bitch! What's going on here? They set fire to the house. Bouncer caught them. This bastard brought her matches. We paid a fortune for your virginity... and you burn the house down? You set the fire? - She said what? - She says she wants to die. So die, you bitch! Want a police case? I'll cut you up into little pieces. - Baba's here now. - She's got some nerve. If I catch you here again... I'll wring your neck. Get out! Want something to drink? Some tea? Some water? Don't worry. Baba's here. it'll be all right. Nobody will dare say a word. Your tantrums won't work in 109. Looking for more trouble? Calmly, now. Want a job? Tame her for me. Baba doesn't do that work anymore. Think it over. She's worth 10,000. Once she's deflowered, 1,000 for you. Well? "Respected Mother, greetings. "I'm well. Hope you are, too. "I didn't run away. "I went back to the circus, but they had all left. "I work in Chacha's tea shop. I think of home." Go on. "I want to come home. "As soon as I have the 500, I'll be back. "They call me Chaipau here, not Krishna. "Don't worry about me. "When I go to sleep, I miss you." That line will cost extra. 50 paisa more. Then drop it. "Your obedient son..." What's your name? Krishna. Mother's address? Bijapur village. Near the riverbank. Near Bholabhai's shop. Ask for Krishna's mother, Sundari. - That's an address? - Yes. Your "yes" won't get it there. There are many Bijapurs all over lndia. Which one is yours? It's near Bangalore. It'll have to do. "Bijapur, near Bangalore." Where do they come from? Waste of a stamp! The crow flies, the bird flies, the parrot flies, the house flies. You lost that round. Manju, do something for me. Give this to Sweet Sixteen. - You gave it to her? - Yes. This journalist wants to talk to you. Tell her... Baba's current woman used to work the streets here. I rescued her from the gutter. This is my child. Say hello. He says the woman he lives with was a prostitute. And he resued her and brought her here. And that's his daughter. My actions speak louder than words. And tell her... she's beautiful stuff. Bastard, think I'll tell her that? What did he say? He said, "Would you like to have some tea?" Order some tea. Three teas, up here! - The camera for sale? - No. Want a two-in-one? Another white sucker! Chillum, prince of my kingdom! What's the hurry? We'll put on a little show. Stand over here. Okay, jump! Good! Bravo! Well done. Please. Hang on. Where are you going? Look, wait! Listen... Still here? This your father's house? The bird's flown. Shut your mouth! Go on, laugh! You'll be crying soon. What did I do? You no longer work for Baba. Fining me for laughing? I'm tired of your mug. The same mug has sold your drugs for years. - Our accounts are clear. - Like hell! And the 150 the foreigner paid? That was a slip. People make mistakes. I'll return the 150. You and me, it's over! Retire somewhere. What will Baba do? Start a new company? Hook another bumpkin on drugs? Listen, hero. Bullshit the others, not me. - You going? - I'm going, with pleasure. Now you know what Baba is. Baba, play with me. Came with the child? I couldn't leave her at home. Sit here. Don't touch anything. Chaipau... this is Manju. See how they dance. How nicely they dance. Here, look. Isn't it nice? I'm in the big room. Will you come and see me? Hurry! When will you come? Chillum! I'll finish him off! The cops will come! I'll kill that pimp! Are you mad? Who told Baba about the white boy? It wasn't me. Who squealed? Not me. I told only Chungal. If you'd said so, I'd have shut up. - Got any money? - No, pal. I swear it! Come, let's sleep. I can't sleep, fucker! I can't sleep without brown. The public looks very happy tonight. Baba, look. Go sleep outside. I want to sleep here. - No. Outside. - Can't I sleep here? I told you, go outside, or you'll get a tight slap. What if Manju had slept here? You took her with you? I couldn't leave her with a madman. Aren't you ashamed? Speak up. Answer me. Her training started already? You pimp. Get out of my life! I'll finish you off! How dare you touch me! What did I say? Just don't take her with you. Is this place any better for her? Asshole. Promised me the world. "When she's born, we'll start a new life." New life! Bloody liar! Everyone thinks I'm a two-bit pimp. What can I say now? Spit out your anger, my angel. What's happened has happened. Bury your anger. Tell me... Where did you go, my jewel? To Ravi's. Doesn't matter. A new nightie? The whore's getting too fancy for Baba? Just like a customer. I told you to get lost! Chillum's very sick. We need money for medicine. Take what you want. I took 20. Fine. Chillum said the souls of Bombay's dead children... wander under the bridge at night. You believe everything Chillum says? This drug racket isn't my scene. So don't tell Chillum. I won't. Please come this way. Now, be pleasant. Don't think of violent things. Ready... one, two, three. Thank you. Who said you could take her out? Gungu Bai, you want her tamed, right? You know Baba's style. If you don't trust me... Screw trust! if she's no longer a virgin, God help you. I don't cheat clients. Virgin they want, virgin they get. Skin the chicken well. You'll be paid 10 rupees each. Here's the knife. I can do it. It's very easy. Chaipau... help me! Ask the boss for an advance. Ask him for a little. Please. No. You got paid? Yes. Where were you? Looking for money. Had a smoke? No, pal. No smoke. I was waiting for you. Got any money? It's money to go home. Fucker, you are not coming? We've been slaving all day. I missed my tea rounds. Chacha will beat me. And you! Lecturing me for 2 lousy rupees. - Give it, please. - No. I'll go home with you. Can't you give a little now? - Forgive me! - Don't touch me. - One more chance. - You stink! Bloody pimp! Lives off women! Chacha, a tea, please. He's been smoking too much. Stop it! What's come over you? I need it badly. I need some brown. Chaipau, get me some! It feels tight inside. Ask your mother for money. She's not home. I want to die. I want to die. I don't want to die. Chaipau, save me. Don't worry, I'll do something. I'll save money. We'll go back to the village. It's lovely there. We'll leave this Bombay, forever. Stand straight! Didn't I tell you to make it tighter? But how will the poor girl breathe? You won't stop breathing, will you? Do as you're told. The first client is vital. Take it off. Yourjob's over. Well done! I'll send the money on. No need to come here again. Keep the door open. What a beauty you are. So lovely. So innocent. Like a rose in the gutter. I'll take you away from here. As soon as I get money... I'll buy off the madam. Do you understand? I'll rescue you. Be patient. Tell me... will you wait for me? Will you? Don't let me down Don't break your promises And where were you? Am I running a charity? Where were you? Working. I told lnsect to do my rounds. You told lnsect? Like you've ever been on time! Broke glasses, made trouble in 109... lost me business. I've warned you before... now you're out! See dozens like you. Here's 300 minus 50... for all the trouble you've caused. Don't come back. You're fired. Can't ever collect trash these days. They're guarding that, too. I told you! Stop collecting trash. Coolie work is best. Shut up! You're like a broken record. Chaipau! Why such a long face? Chacha sacked me. Hey, fellows, want to do a job? We know your kind ofjob. Cash. Hard cash! No guts, no glory. Count me in. Need a boy to fetch milk? Yes, that's right. Little girl, what's your name? - You go to school? - Yes. And who are you? Brothers. Sit down. I'll bring you kids something to eat. Like a sweet? Nothing, sir! How did you get in? Who are you? Thieves! Chungal, leave him to me. I've got to pee. Run, Bumpkin! I'm Coalpiece of Grant Road. I'll save you. I've studied to fifth grade. I can even speak English. Hello! Shut up! As you like! Salaam to the King of Bombay, salute, my buddy celebrate big-city life, eat, drink and be merry Get it? I'm the queen of butterflies, here I come I flit! I flee! I fly! So what if the train's in!

My perfume lingers in your beard My flower lingers in your crotch How do you feel? If one had to live, then life should be like this. Not missing your mother? I am! I'm going home tomorrow. Baba, wake up! What is it? Chillum's very sick. You woke Baba for that? He's shaking like a leaf. He's ice-cold. All that junkie needs is a fix. What happened? He said he'd smoked too much. The name of God is truth. What are you up to? You mean bastard. Where's my money? Give me back my money. My money to go home. Chillum took your money. I saw him. Fucker! Call me a thief? I want to go home. Hey, evil-eye, wash the glasses. And what am I doing? Don't pester me. Mommy, he hit me. Pass the food. No tips for us? Be grateful for what you get. We're not beggars, sir. 20 rupees for so much work? Shut up and eat. Here, Manju. Eat all you can. Now's your chance. This bill looks torn. Guess it'll do. My stomach's bursting! You ate 20 meals in one. And you didn't? No. Is that a stomach or a stadium you have? Hey, Salim. You shouldn't have hit that kid. We would've had it. With rich kids, you can never win. The rich don't scare me. Stop! What are you up to? We're going home, sir. We've just finished duty at a wedding. What's this? King of samosa thieves! I didn't steal them, sir. What's in there? My money to go home. It's true, sir. Sure it's true! Come on. I'll take you home. It'll be all right. One day... in our lndia, things will be all right. Come down! Brothers! Sing with one voice.

What's your name? Krishna. Here for stealing butter like Lord Krishna! So, what are you in for? - What's it to you? - Don't act smart. Answer. - I did nothing. - Liar. Don't call me a liar. They're off to another court hearing. Show me your card. What's on it? Your court date is in six months. So take it easy, relax. Be cool. My name is Murtaza. I saw you destroy Lalua Chor. They're always picking on me. I'm not even new. Been here five years. Five years! Some boys have been here longer. I didn't do anything. They can't keep me. They can. See that baldy over there? He was caught pissing on the street. They got him. He's been inside for three years. I didn't do anything. Even if I did, I've forgotten. Five years, and they all forget us. See that boy? They pick on him all day. He spends his time washing his shirt! His screw is loose. You know "screw"? it's loose. Krishna, teach me your kick. Show me how you do it. Like this? Krishna, is this right? Manju Golub! Manju. How are you? Are you all right? Say something, Manju. How can I tell you how lost I feel without you? Your friends ask, "Where's that rascal, Manju?" What a nice dress that is! Want to play? Don't worry, life of mine. We'll take you home soon. Don't worry. Don't be scared. We'll come back and take you home. Long live Lord Ganesh In your presence, all obstacles can be overcome Krishna, have I got it right? Get lost, nutcase! Come here, you retard! Hiding like a mouse. Leave him alone. Think you're boss? Enough of your tough act. Now watch me! When can I take her home? Take a seat. Children don't always know what's best for them. We have children whose parents beat them. Yet they cling to their parents. I've never hit her. How dare you! Just an example. Look at Manju. Why doesn't she speak? She wants to go home. She doesn't like it here. She was fine. She used to talk a lot. The past is irrelevant. We're dealing with the present here. You see, women like you... Well, let's forget about that. Your file's here. Let me look. "Due to the fact that the mother is a prostitute... "the state has decided... "for the child's welfare, she must be kept... "in state custody until she comes of age." Of course, you have the right to appeal. But why? Why not let her be adopted by a good family? Her life will be made. It'll be easier on you, too. Won't it? She's my daughter. She's all I have in the world. How can the State be her mother? Sixer! Master! Bad luck! He can't play cricket. He's better doing toothpaste ads on TV! Go brush your teeth instead! Quiet! Let me listen. Silence! Silence! Every night, I dream that I escape from the Chiller Room. If anyone tries to stop me, I kick them. Anyone stops me, I kick them. Right! Dream on! Krishna, want to try? Get lost, nutball! I swear it. I'm not joking. That way. It's bloody far. Let's try our luck. No luck! Look over there. Hurry! Come on. - You smart-ass! - It's mine. Who are you? Chillum. Where are the others? On trash rounds. You work for Baba? - Yes. - Sell his drugs? - Smoke, too? - Mind your own business. I'm going home. Will you come with me? This way, please. Just look at her! Stand up, dear. Turn around, dear. Isn't she a pure bud? I've kept her safely, especially for you. Beautiful! Come, my dear. Where are you going? Are you leaving home? - Without Manju there is no home. - But I'm here. You said this wasn't a good place for Manju. I'll bring her back. Promise. Baba's promise. I know your promise. Go to Sweet Sixteen. That was work. Nothing else. Must I refuse work? Drop it. If you say drop it, I'll drop it. Now I'm yours, full-time. Tired of work? it happens, I understand. Let's go out. Where shall we go? Where will you live? You'll be chewed up by Bombay. Move! What haven't I done for you? You'll leave a proper home? Turning holy, whore? Want to wash away your sins? Want to become Mother lndia? Look, I don't want trouble. Get out of my way, or else. Or else what? Will you kill me? Finish me off, my angel. Kill me! Go on! Finish me off, kill me!
