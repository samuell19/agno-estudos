(rooster crowing) - Z could you read this? Hey Z, why don't you read this. No don't read it to yourself, read it out loud. I want you to hear it. Dear Reader, wise ass prick bastard scaley back grease top motherfucking bitch. I have decided to write one half hour every day. I may have to build my half hour from five, 10, and perhaps even one minute spurts. I'll not the minutes at each finale. The first one is approximate. Three minutes. I must write one half hour each day. This is not personal. That's perfect, huh? - Don't do that to me. (crying) I didn't even understand what you said to me. No, no. Hi, what you guys doing? - Well see we're making this movie, and that guy right there with the beard and the (mumbles) he's this kind of killer, and then me, I'm soon to be future corpse. And that's Z over there. See, she is Z, and she's the heroine of this whole thing. - [Voiceover] Action. Wanted to talk about Dick. Like what you know of him for real and what projections that you have. Okay and remember you're talking to Dick about him, so you're using you for Dick. - Okay, that's really hard. Okay what. I don't know what impression, okay when I first met you, I was... I don't think I liked you when I first met you. It was because of a trust thing, I don't think I trusted you, you were frightening in a way, I don't know why. Dark. You gave off dark vibrations, dark. Stern kind of things. And I guess I didn't see any ways into you so I didn't try to do anything. I don't know anything about you at all. I know what you look like and I know that we're here together. But I don't know you at all. I guess I like you all right but I don't feel close to you at all. - Well he really loved Betty Davis. If that helps you out. I mean sometimes when you hold your head just right, he had that kind of look, he had that Betty Davis look. And I know that he, well he told me that, and if you smile, although you don't really do that very often, but when you do, sometimes it looks like Betty Davis. I gotta walk over there for it? This isn't the music? (light music) and suddenly you're over. - Now I start to sing. * The night is the * The stars have lost their glitter (cross talk) * And suddenly you're older - Dance. Don't you wanna dance? Ow. (mumbles) If he's gonna hurt me I don't like it. (mumbles) - it's for real. (mumbles) - it scared the shit out of me. (mumbles) death scene right in the middle of the field. (mumbles) okay should we do it or what? (light music) * The wind is colder * Suddenly you're older * And all because of the man * Who got away (singing) - you still remind me of Betty Davis. (laughter) - I'm through with love, I'll never smile again. (laughter) had my fill with love. (laughter) did we pull one over on them or what? At least my face is warming up. (laughter) - he's not sure sometime. I guess that's what he really meant. Because he spoke to me about that for a long long time, and I think that's what he really meant. Was that he just wasn't sure. And that's why he sometimes, when he walked around you, he kind of got some weird angles going in reference to you. I mean he stood in a place that would make you look right. If you know what I mean. Because you didn't put yourself in that position enough around him. So he's making a big adjustment for you, in fact is what he's doing. Where at least what he wants you to be. He's compensating for it. I guess you don't know that's what he wants. (mumbles) (laughter) what the fuck is going on? - [Voiceover] Okay sleep asleep scene 62 take one. (laughter) - hi, what you guys doing? - Well see that guy right there with the beard and (mumbles) he's a killer, and me, see. I'm sort of this future to be victim, and this is Z right here. She is Z, and she is the heroine of this whole thing. - [Voiceover] The cinema is interesting because it sees its life and the mortal aspect of it. - [Voiceover] So my killer became uncle Jim. (knocking) - [Voiceover] Okay next, (mumbles). Okay lean down a little bit more. Okay. Look at the door quick. Try that again. try it one more time (mumbles). - When you add in all the things I know about you, and the things that you admitted, you're like a moth flying into the flame of the candle. You're lust, your avarice. Your selfishness, your insatiable desire for drugs, all of these are leading you to destruction, just like that poor little insect. And the worst part of it is, that you're not even as good as that moth, because he flies into the flame by instinct. But you have a God given chance to make a choice. And you haven't even had the guts to make it. You're just a stupid moth. - [Voiceover] Hey boy lets hear it for them protozoas. - Jesus. - More coffee? - Sure. - Yeah he drank mine. (mumbles) - that's it. - Thanks (mumbles). - [Voiceover] How bout some milk? - Yeah here. Oh. Thank you. - Dickie? - No thank Unc. - [Voiceover] Got your (mumbles) going today huh? - Oh yeah, light my fire. - Who was that guy? - Oh. Dick. He and I knew each other a long time ago and he went to Vietnam and when he came back he was changed a lot, he was strange. So he left. And I didn't see him for a long time, and just recently he wrote me a letter telling me to come and meet him here. - It's gonna rain. - Hello Rob, Ed. Listen I've got something important to tell you. Meet me at the hotel in 15 minutes. All right. And ever since, I've been playing the game. That I, me, your buddy, a professional hit man. Isn't that something? And there's this girl. Beautiful with the guy, you know. She's a honey. She's everything I ever wanted, she's every movie goddess I've ever worshipped. And then you know, she wanted me. We went to my house, and along the way, I died a thousand deaths. Just worrying and fretting about the everything that might happen. But she was perfectly at ease. Possibilities yeah but, yeah. I took her back to my house (mumbles) what a mess it is. And you know what? She didn't seem to notice. She just pushed things aside, and half laid on the couch. Smiling at me. She said smiling at me, she wanted me. Great Jehosiphat. Look at that dress. Where'd you get it baby? - In a garage. (light music) (laughter) - oh I'm sorry Mr. (mumbles) oh please let me try it again. I'll be good this time, oh I want to be a star (mumbles) - Dick Dick, start over (mumbles) start at the top. Okay lets keep going. - Thank you thank you. - Oh. - Oh thank you thank you. - And presenting. Our perenial favorite. Florence Nightingale. (light music) * And if she could only hear me * This is what I say * Honey pie * You are making me crazy * I'm in love but I'm lazy * So won't you please come home * Oh honey pie - big generation gap here huh? (laughter) (mumbles) (laughter) - yes. I wanted to make love to her, you see. But that's all I really wanted to do. But when I got down to it, I began thinking about it, I began doubting it. Sure, because it didn't seem right. You don't fuck Carol Lumbard or you don't fuck Carol Lumbard, or Betty Davis just like that. When I think of putting my swollen cock, or even worse your swollen cock into their pussy, into their pussy, your swollen cock, my swollen cock, into their perfect body, Christ I can't do that. And she was all of them, she was all of them. Lying there in semi repose. With a bit of baby fat thighs. (laughter) bit of baby fat thighs peeking out from under her - [Voiceover] Hike up dress. - Hike up, that's it, that's it. Man, beauty. Grace. Her majesty, that's a good one. That's a good one, and her incredible 5000 mile away eyes. But I couldn't fuck her. She moved slightly you see, and I put my hands up between her legs. Up above her million dollar knees. (laughter) million dollar knees. They were red hot. And I like jerked my hand away like from a hot stove. (mumbles) yeah I could tell she was getting impatient and... Maybe a little bit scared. I wanted to hug her and hold her. Kiss her and take care of her forever. So I thought I'd kiss her and simultaneously, this is simultaneously. I'd put my hand on her breast, but my coordination was off. My coordination was gone, just fucked up. And so my hand reached her breast before my lips met hers. You get that? You get the picture there? You see that? My hands touched her breast before our lips met. And I looked at it, my hand I mean. And it it'd been too fast, it moved much faster than I wanted. (mumbles) yeah. - [Voiceover] Too fast. - Too fast. So I grabbed her tit. Oh and there I was with my four fingers my thumb, churning the flesh of her tit in my hands. - [Voiceover] Bet it felt good huh? - Felt good sure. It's supposed to feel good, but actually, I wasn't feeling anything. I must have been in a state of shock. I know that I was afraid of losing. - [Voiceover] What do you mean? - I was afraid of losing it. I know that - [Voiceover] Your hand? - I'd lose my hand yeah, that's it. (laughter) I'd lose my hand. What a situation. And I looked at my hand, and it was just like a crab on her tit. Keeping all that fun away from me. Fucking crabs. (laughter) crabs crabs. So I grabbed the crab with my left hand, and tried to strangle it. But it squirmed around and tried to claw me, so I grabbed it and struck it on the back of the couch. Pow pow, pow. (laughter) man. She was really looking strange at me. (laughter) and I guess I must have grinned a little. And you know what? I let go of the crab. - [Voiceover] Jesus. (laughter) this time. You've done it this time. Hey Ed, Ed Ed. Shh, this is a restaurant. Hey hey. Ed. - Yeah. - [Voiceover] How many drinks have you had tonight? - Enough. - [Voiceover] Jeez I never heard anything like that before from you. - Those crabs will get you every time. - [Voiceover] I didn't think you had girlfriends. - I got them all in my dreams. But I got those dreams. - Thank you. - I have a surprise for you. Here it is. - What do you want me to do with this? - Lets take it. - [Voiceover] Beautiful isn't it? No no, don't touch it with your fingers. Here, I'll lift it out with this silver spoon. Open your palm. There, feels warm doesn't it? All right, drop it on the table, bam. That's it, hit it with a hammer. Bam bam. Feel better? Yeah. You can carve your initials in the table. (laughter) - well thanks a lot uncle Jim. - [Voiceover] Uncle Jim did you get any groceries? - Yeah. You people gotta tell me what you want. If you find something you like, you're supposed to say (sound effects). If you find something you don't like, you're supposed to say. (sound effects) (laughter) - hey. Hey you know what's coming back in town this morning? (mumbles) and we stopped. And as I was getting out of the car I heard this sound. And it was sort of like a gun shot. Intuitively I ducked, and then I realized it was just a truck back firing or something. - [Voiceover] Not sure where he was born, and he's in his 30s, but maybe 33, 34, 35 years old. There's a scene in the movie, they call it the awkward love scene. Its a title that I don't especially like but let's keep with it. But in truth it was an awkward thing for me to do, it was a long monologue, about five or six pages. Very immature in its sexuality. And it was the images of this great movie goddess, one that had everything that I'd ever wanted to have. So it was kind of a sexual fantasies little kid and here I am, a 60 year old man supposed to be saying this and believe it. Main thing was that I couldn't spout this believing that it was me, so it didn't represent me. It represented Dick, and probably its true, about Dick. - Good. - You like it? - Its not my dream, it's different. - Yeah, no, I didn't mean it to be your dream. Its my dream but I wrote it for you. After I heard you and Z talking. On the porch the other day. - I saw you were listening. (mumbles) (mumbles) - it's cold. (unintelligible talking) - if I'd have known we were going to come out here I would have brought more clothes. - You think its too early to go to a bar? - Not too early. - Nice hottie tottie. - Keep us warm. When I look out on the ocean there. (mumbles) whoa. - I'm cold lets go. - [Voiceover] I mean he aint never said anything and I'm not gonna say anything to him about it but, I can just tell. I can just tell from the kind of looks he gives me. The way he touches me sometimes. - [Voiceover] It's a younger fellow, and he did the writing of the film, he did most of the scripting. There's a scene where I denounce Dick. Some of it was fake, in otherwards there's kind of an attitude of righteousness in it that I don't really believe in. But I think I did kind of a nice vehement job denouncing Dick in this moth scene. This was a scene that upset Dick because it was not written by him. He wasn't upset because I'd done it, but he hadn't been forwarned, he didn't know it was coming. And so when it hit him, it made quite an effect upon him. Which I didn't realize it was going to do. I think originally, when they planned this film, neither he nor Dick and Z didn't really know each other. And finally they came to sleep together. Which was okay with me, and that was their problem. - [Voiceover] When the filming first started, I had only met him one time, I didn't know him at all. But in about three days time I got to know him very well. I got to know him so well that I tried to kill him once during the shooting of the film. - [Voiceover] During the course of the filming she told me a lot about herself. But without actually giving me any facts to speak of. That is, facts about her parents, where she was raised, and the kind of life experiences she had. Up until that time that we met. She's a very sensitive person. She cloaks her sensitivity in brashness. We had a funny relationship. Because it was all tied up in and snared in this funny film fantasy that we were involved in. We were movie stars, I guess. Is where we were at. Yeah we were movie stars. Movie stars and motorcars and diamond rings. Those kinds of things. - [Voiceover] The basic story is very simple. Dick is holed up in the town of Mendocino, with his girlfriend Z. A contract has been let out on him, and he's expecting a hit man to come at any time. Somehow I blunder into this situation. And since I'm a teller of tall stories, I'm not averse to their thinking that I'm the killer. (light music) - did I tell you about the time when I lived in New York? (mumbles) railroad tracks. - No. - Well two things I understand about New York are (mumbles) that New York gets very cold, and very hot. if you live in a railroad platform, have a lot of cockroaches. Well the cockroaches when its cold, they'll just move, just like molasses. They can hardly go, they can't get anywhere. When it's hot, if you look at a cockroach on the wall over there, he just explodes. Bang. He's gone. Just because you looked at him. But the funniest thing I ever saw about cockroaches was, you know about their mother and father cockroaches. - Yeah. - Well the papa cockroaches when they go down the wall, they just go down easy like. But you get a pregnant mother cockroach with a big bunch of egg cases behind her on her abdomen, she goes down the wall, this is what she looks like. She goes down like this. (laughter) looks like a drunk. And she's got a big load to carry that way. You know what finally happens when she gets down safely away? - No. - All the little baby cockroaches come out and say... - I think it was the fish you see. One day he was shooting in the water with my 38. And I guess it was the concussion that got it. The fish I mean. Anyway he was shooting in the water. (gun shots) - He killed this fucking fish. We're gutting the fish. It is an operation. I mean it doesn't exist in reality. Only in my mind. I mean it's real. - And I think that was it. But Z isn't close to him yet, she's... Been suspicious, and she doesn't know about the fish. About the incident with uncle Jim and me. Regarding the fish. - [Voiceover] Jim? Jim. Jim. Jim. (mumbles) (laughter) - back up all my cares. (mumbles) here I go. Singing (mumbles) bye bye. Blackbird Where somebody waits for me. Sugars sweet, so is he. Bye bye blackbird. No one here to love or understand me. (crying) - [Voiceover] Death scene scene 95 take one tail (mumbles) . - [Voiceover] All right turn out the fucking lights everybody get out of here. (mumbles) - my primary concern has got to be me. Yeah. Me. My concern for the masses only comes when it deals with death, justice and crime. Eli made me sick. Killers make me sick. Move on baby. You know the only casualty at Neli was, I mean the only American casualty at Neli was this guy who shot himself in the leg. A black guy (mumbles). He wanted to shoot Cali. But he couldn't. I could have been that guy. I could have been Cali too. Shit I could have been any one of them. I know I could have been Cali. I could have just walked out there in all my hostility and frustration and said shoot. Bam bam bam. There's no justification for killing. I could kill very easily. * The dreams you share * Have all gone astray * The road gets rougher * It's longer and it's tougher * With hopes you'd burn up * Tomorrow he may turn up (buzzing) (gun shot)
