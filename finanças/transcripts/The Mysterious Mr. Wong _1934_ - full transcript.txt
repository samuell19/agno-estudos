[MUSIC PLAYING] -We have been send her to put and end to Wong's crimes. So far we have failed. -He's a mad man, Julian. He must be found, and the coins of Confucius restored to Keelat. In the hands of Wong, they mean destruction. [GONG] -One more. The province of Keelat will know the rightful ruler. -[INAUDIBLE]. [GONG] -That awful gong. Every time it sounds, Wong gives his dreadful order. And terrible things begin to happen. -Did the ancient and honorable name of Wong fall from the lips of his gracious and loyal niece? -These doors must have keyholes. There will always be those who listen at them. -It would be unfortunate to have to shut so beautiful a personage in the dungeon of the faithless. -You wouldn't dare. -Wong has dared many things. He will continue to dare. And one day it is acclaimed by all Keelat. -You are wrong. -You were never intended by fate to rule Keelat. -Time will teach you to guard indifferent speech. -He frightens me. The madness of him is driving all reason from his mind. -It would seem that the little affairs of the Tong are of interest to this Mr. Jason H. Barton. Now, we cannot be [INAUDIBLE] with one of our own. But this Mr. Jason H. Barton. I trust for his own good interest will not bring him too close to the house of Wong. -Mr. Barton. Come on, cut out the playing, would ya? -Come here, I want to talk to you. -What is this, now, Chief? Why don't you follow up with that Chinatown story? -Oh, nix on that now, chief. I ran out of gas and flipped on over to the banana wars. -There's nothing in it? -You guess it, chief. -Yes, and I've outguessed you, too, Barton. Another killing in Chinatown. A laundryman on Huron Street. -Aw, what do I care about another laundryman? The world is full of them. Besides, I send my stuff out to a steam launder anyway. -Did you ever run into a Chinaman by the name of Wong? -If I ever run into one that ain't named Wong. -Oh, now, never mind that stuff. Park yourself down in Chinatown and remember the name. Wong. Fu Wong. -OK, chief. Fu Wong it is. I could've done a slow story on the evil-- -Oh, never mind that. Get out of here. -Oh, you lost a dog? Oh, just a moment, madam. I'll connect you with the classified advertising. -What does she want us to do, put out an extra? -Oh, hello. Say, park that thing, will you? I read your story this morning. -Did you? Did you get a kick out of it? -They've been kicking all day. -Chalk that one up for you. I didn't ask for that, I begged for it. Oh-- I've got some bad news for you. I can't take you out to lunch today. -Ha. That isn't bad news. Robert from the Gazette has been trying to get me all morning, to take me to lunch at the Biltmore. -Oh, is that so? Well, you listen to me. You're not going out with any Gazette lug, anyway. -Says you with a tone of finality. -Says I with a ton of finality. -Hello? Oh, yes, chief. Yes, he's here now. All right, I'll tell him. He says to remind you that the Chinaman's name is Wong. -You tell that pay stabbing, credit grabbing, hunk of animated baloney, go out and find himself a nice wet blanket and wrap it around his ears. -Oh, hello. Yes, Steve. He said thank you a thousand times. Oh, yes, I'll tell him. He says he doesn't want to burden you with too much detail, but to remind you that this is a daily newspaper and not a monthly magazine. -OK, kid. You let that Gazette lug spend his money at the Biltmore for lunch. But remember, you have a steak and mushroom dinner date with our regular columnist. Oh, let me go. -Hello, attendant? Come and get him now, he's ripe. [INTERPOSING VOICES] -All right, what is it you want? -I've been sent over by the Globe to do this work. -You're too late. It's already been done. -Ha! I'll buy that one. [INAUDIBLE]. Where's the body? Must have been writing something. -Yeah. But we couldn't find nothing that the poor devil had been writing at the time. Meanwhile the detective found him just like that. You're the first one of the reporters who's likely to land. The newspapers don't care nothing about these Tong killings. -So you think it's a Tong killing, do you? -What else could it be? Even the dick would see it wasn't old age. -You're right. Tong wars are old stuff. But I'll tip you off to one thing. This was no Tong job. Did you ever hear Chinaman named Wong? -They all sound alike to me. And this Chinaman ain't much for talking. Except old Li See, the herb dealer down the street. He knows everybody and he's a regular old gossip. -Li See, huh? I'll look him up after I take a peek around a bit. [GONG] -[INAUDIBLE] No have coins. -What is this? You have come to bring me my fate. There is only one coin to be found. And calmly, you report failure? -No! [INAUDIBLE] -You deny, but the eyes express [INAUDIBLE]. [GASPS] [SCREAM] -You housed with the rats. We'll make him speak [INAUDIBLE]. -Oh, he's bad, I tell you. -Them Chinaman is jabbering like monkeys. I've had to clear them away every ten minutes. On your way, on your way. This club makes about 20 knots an hour and I'm getting upstaged. There's never noisier than Chinaman when you want quiet, or quieter when you want information. -You know, Confucius said practically the same thing. -Has he been in here, too? -Not today. -Then it's all right then. Nobody unofficial must view the body. -Do you believe in hunches? -The McGillicudys was raised on them. -Then believe in the one I've got, Mac. It's hotter than the first of August. -Too smart, you are. -Buy me one for luck. Maybe you like some herbs? -Maybe so. But I don't think so. -What do you like? -Well, I want to talk to you. Eh, you've been around here a long time, haven't you? And I bet you could spring a story or two, hey, old timer? -Li See sells herbs. Not have stories. -OK for me. Ever play hunches? -Sometimes we play [INAUDIBLE]. Don't play hunch games. [GONG] -What was that? The end of the first round? And who won? -No, no story. Don't play hunch games. Shut up shop now. Some other time come. Maybe next day, sometime, maybe, I don't know. Maybe not. -Tell no stories. No play no hunch games. Maybe read sometime, maybe. I'll keep this until you decide to be a little chummy and personable. -Maybe ticket tell about long time ago poetry, maybe. -Plenty maybe. I'll take this to the Chan Fu at the university and have a poet who will autograph it for you. But I'll see you again sometime, maybe tomorrow, maybe the next day, I don't know. Maybe not. So long. -Your men have eyes that see not. Sam Foy left a message. [INAUDIBLE] laundry to get it. The white newspaperman will have it. He takes it to Chan Fu at the university. You will see that the ticket does not arrive to Chan Fu. -Ain't that something different. -This white devil cannot be buried with one of our own race. May cause the police to be curious about even such a humble personage as old Li See the herb dealer. It should not be difficult to make it appear an accident. -A very evil looking spider is about to visit your pocket. -Yes? It's a pet of mind. I keep it to bite strangers. Hey, my floor. PROFESSOR: Come in. -Are you Professor Fu? -Yes sir. -You're the chap that knows all about the Chinese language, aren't you? -I understand many dialects of my mother tongue. You'll have a seat? [PHONE RINGING[ -No thanks. -Hello? [SPEAKING CHINESE DIALECT] [SPEAKING CHINESE DIALECT] [SPEAKING CHINESE DIALECT] [SPEAKING CHINESE DIALECT] [SPEAKING CHINESE DIALECT] -Hello? Hello? You have a ticket you wish me to translate. -Now, how did you find that out? -Someone just told me. -Uh-oh. Somebody's been reading my mail. Who was that? -I don't know. -Say, you don't happen to be a spider snatcher, do you? -Spider snatcher? -Let it ride. Let it ride. Let's start all over again. -Cast your spectacles on that. -It would interest me much to have the other half of the ticket. -I'm beginning to develop quite an interest in that ticket myself, professor. -It merely mentions the coin of Confucius. -What does the coin of Confucius got to do with a laundry ticket? -That, I cannot say. -Well, never mind the ticket. What about the coins? -It goes back into the history of my country. But that wouldn't interest you. -You think it wouldn't. Well, I'll be seeing you. Good bye, sir. [INAUDIBLE] -And you have no idea who telephoned you? -The voice was unknown to me. -The young man desired you to make a translation of the ticket. As you had been warned? -Precisely. Unfortunately, a portion of the ticket was missing. He promised to bring it some other time. -To know the full message of the ticket of would be of great value. Bring this information to me, and the province of Keelat will not disregard the favor. -Say, what kind of pie is this? -Well, it's the same shape as a lemon pie, but what that stuff is on the top, I don't know. -Think [INAUDIBLE]. -Hello. Biltmore, huh? -Um, Mr. Roberts from the Gazette. -How do you do, Mr. Roberts? I'm [INAUDIBLE]. You nearly forgot your hat, Mr. Roberts. -But I'm not going yet. -Oh, yes, he is. Darling, the menu please? Thank you, darling. -What were you saying? -Would you like to go to the six day bike race with me on Tuesday night? -Oh, I'd love it. I think it'd be swell. -Probably get in a jam and have an awful spill. -That rhymes with pill. -And after the race, we can go someplace and dance, say, at the Biltmore? -Oh, good. Then I'll dress. -I hope so. Well, you'll have to excuse me for a little while. I've got to get back to my business. Goodbye. -Liberty 0-4-3-6. Liberty 0-4-3-6. [PHONE RINGING] -Hello? -Hello, is Chuck Roberts there? -Mr. Roberts? Just a minute, please. Mr. Roberts, you're wanted on the phone. -Oh, thanks. Excuse me. -Hello? -Hello, Chuck. How would you like to have a ticket to the football game this afternoon? -I'd like it. -OK, be at the bowl in 30 minutes and there'll be one waiting for you at the East Gate. -OK. Who is this? -[INAUDIBLE] -Who? -[INAUDIBLE] -Oh, thanks, George. OK. -Gee, I'm sorry, Peg. That was the boss. I've got to go right back to the office. He's got a special assignment for me. I'm awfully sorry. I'll see you soon, won't I? Bye. -Hello, back again. -For a dumb egg, you're almost smart. But not as smart as you think, Mr. Wiseguy. -Why, say, listen. Do you mean to tell me you really like that mug? -I don't mean to tell you anything except to mind your own business. WAITRESS: What'll you have, Mr. Barton? -A glass of water and nothing to eat. -Some people want to starve themselves. It's perfectly all right with me. Aren't you ever happy unless you make a fellow feel miserable? -Mmm, I wouldn't say that. Say waitress, bring him a piece of pie. He doesn't know what he wants. Aw, come on. Let's forget it. How about dinner? -You know, there's something about you that a fellow has to like. -You know, you're not so bad either, come to think of it. -Eh, listen, Woody. To Come on, something to eat. What do you have to do to get service around here? -Well, what you ordered? -What's that? -Corned beef and cabbage. -Oh, that'll do. -Oh, I'm sorry. That belongs to someone else. -Give them my apology. Mmm. Ooh, corned beef and cabbage. Gee, that reminds me of McGillicudy. I've got to get back on the job, they're liable to pull another murder on me. These Chinese work fast. Just have time for a bite. Hey, waitress, give me another little order of this stuff. -And that by any chance isn't your idea of steak and mushrooms, is it? -Not on your life. When I say steak and mushrooms I mean steak and mushrooms. -That a boy. Steak and mushrooms. -So you don't know nothing about it, eh? Well, well, well, I suppose you were all out of town when this happened. -Hello, Mac. What, another one? -Seems like they just can't keep from killing each other off. -Say, this is getting monotonous. I'm supposed to bring in real live news and the best I can do is run down dead Chinaman. -Better dead ones than live ones, if you care what's happening to you. Especially where killing's a pastime. [INTERPOSING VOICES] -Quiet, quiet. I can't hear myself thing. -This is poor old [INAUDIBLE]. -Oh, you know him, eh? -Yeah, he's a professor of languages. -Well, he's sure speaking a dead language now. How much does that make, five or six? -I don't know, I've lost count. -He'll be getting you next. Why don't you go on home? -I'm getting more reasons every minute for staying. -Now go on, on your way. We'll take care of this. -Well, [INAUDIBLE] for a little [INAUDIBLE] visit, isn't it? -Would you mind telling me what your interest is here? -Oh, no, you tell me about you. -Sam Foy was a connection of mine. -I get it. Somebody cut off the connection. -It might be called that. -Well, if Sam Foy was a relative, this might mean something to you. -Are you aware of what is written here? -Sorry, not a Chinamen's chance. -Bowl. -Bowl? Oh, you mean that. Ah, you're wasting your time. You're looking for a coin? Someone beat you to it. You and another Chinese gentleman wearing a dragon ring seem to have the same idea about that coin. Only he works faster. -A dragon ring? -Sure, one of those long tailed animals with a-- -You are sure about this ring? -You bet I am. And the gentleman that's wearing this ring packs a mean wallop. A goodly thing to know. -Thank you. -Hey. Listen, pal, what's this all about? -It would give me great pleasure to enlighten you. But there are reasons why it is impossible. However, you may have down my country a great service. -I'll trade the metals for a little low down. Say, about who killed Sam Foy. What relation he is of yours, for information about a Chinaman named Wong. You don't happen to be Mr. Wong, do you? -To think I am Wong would be a grave mistake. -I'm beginning to suspect I've made a couple of them already. -I, too, would like to know something of this man Wong. -Well, listen, pal. What do you say you and me get together. Listen, Mr.-- I didn't quite get the name. -[INAUDIBLE], China. -Jason H. Barton, Los Angeles. -Goodbye, Mr. Jason H. Barton, Los Angeles. -You newspaper lads swoop right in, don't you. Who's your buddy? -Says his name is High Strung or something. -He's a new one on me. -Yeah, all they're all new ones on me. -What I can't understand is why a nice home loving boy like you likes to play around with cutthroats and murderers. -The same to you, Mr. McGillicuddy, and many of it. -Well, what can I do for you? -Uh, you likey nicey antique candy? Tastes like [INAUDIBLE] gloves. How about nice set of herbs? If you're in the market, yes, we've been here for 50 years, [INAUDIBLE]. Perhaps you'd like a [INAUDIBLE] herring, absolutely a herring to end all herrings, huh? Hello, [INAUDIBLE]. Where did you come from? -Well, Li See very old man. Old feet make little noise. -Meet the sales de resistance. [SPEAKING CHINESE DIALECT] -Oh, that's what you wanted. Why didn't you say so before, little girl? -You didn't give me an opportunity. -Maybe you bring ticket, maybe? -I did not. -Maybe big university man tell you what it says, maybe? -You're getting hot. -Play another hunch game, maybe? -You've got the idea, old timer. My hunch is, if anyone knows what's going on around here, you do. -Hunch game no good. Li hear nothing, see nothing. -Li speak nothing. Never mind the monkey business. -You go now. Come back tomorrow, maybe. Maybe ticket bring you luck, maybe. -Sorry, I'm sticking around for a while. -Maybe buy some herbs. Maybe. -Tomorrow buy herbs, maybe. Today maybe you talk, maybe. -Li See no talk. Too much talk, too much trouble. -The Sam Foy laundry ticket. How come you've got such a boot out of that? -Li See no get boot. Li See cuts paper. --[INAUDIBLE] Why were you hotfooting it out of the laundry a few minutes ago? -There's no hot feet. [GONG] -Listen. My paper wants the low down on this Sam Foy killing and I've got a hunch you've got it. -Say, Li. Have you got anymore of how those Chinese gumdrops? Oh, so here you are. [INAUDIBLE] got me down. There ain't been a murder around here in 30 minutes. Oh ho, so you caught up with this one again? -Is this another one of your connections? -No connection. Maybe long time ago friend. Maybe I don't know. [INAUDIBLE] -Man sometimes answers his neighbor's door as friend. Other times, as enemy. -Li See's door very friendly. -My eyes see something in you that's familiar. My mind does not recall. Were you ever in Keelat? -Keelat? Long far away. Maybe, I don't know. I guess so. Li See one time go Los Angeles on boat. -What can you tell us of your departed neighbor, Sam Foy? -No know Sam Foy. He washing man. Li See sell herbs. -Do you know anything about a man named Wong? -Hey, hey, if you're going to throw them away, I know a fellow that can use some of them. -Eh-- [INAUDIBLE]. Li See very old man. No go out. No know Wong. Maybe don't [INAUDIBLE]. Maybe so, I don't know. -Maybe you Wong. Maybe so, I don't know. I give up. -Me, Li See? The herb dealer? Everybody know old Li See. -OK, I was just kidding. -Come on lads. There's no news here. -Say, if it's true that no news is good news, that guy could make an editor awfully happy. Well, we'll run down that guy Wong yet. -As they say in your country, I'm [INAUDIBLE]. -OK, boys. You'll have to get along without me now, for a little while. Because I have a heavy date with a hungry female. And as they also say in my country, ops-cay on the ob-jay and he's in the ag-bay. -Strange tribute. These Americans have-- very friendly to old Li See. -The secret service of Keelat has grown negligent, when it allows good luck to get the better of it. Put coins in the hands as one so humble as old Li See, the herbalist. -Ah. The mysterious Mr. Wong, [INAUDIBLE], a traitor. -Well, if this is steak and mushrooms, why'd you order chop suey? -It is steak and mushrooms here, tossed around a little bit. -If you don't mind, I'd like to do my own tossing around. -Ah, it's just like women. Always squawking. Now you're beefing about the food. This cost a pretty penny. -Don't you think I'm due for a beef or two? You know, this isn't the Biltmore. -You can get everything here you can get at the Biltmore. Lights, food, music, atmosphere, indigestion. Yeah, but I've got you and not Chuck Roberts. -Oh, yeah, you've got Chuck Roberts right in there. Everything's in there. -Now that I've finished my dinner, would you mind telling you why we're down here in Chinatown? -Right now I'm looking for this fellow Wong. -Say, would you mind putting these things down and eating with your knife and let's get out of here? Aw, lay off, will you? -Who's Wong? -He's an old pushover. He's that [INAUDIBLE]. He works with a knife and he's never out of work. And mixed up in it somewhere are the twelve coins of Confucius. -Oh, a money argument, huh? -He's been holding his fine for a couple of centuries. -Who, Wong? -No, Confucius. -Say, how old is this guy? -Mmm, couple of thousand years? -We ought to call in an undertaker. -Hey, listen. You're not kidding me, sis. This thing is serious. -You will shortly experience a great danger. Something tells me I'm not going to be very happy here. [GASP] -What's the matter? Is the chop suey getting you down already? Come on, drink your tea. It'll get cold. Come on, let's get out of here. -Never thought I'd see one of those gold coins, baby, that close. What do you think of it? -Oh, take it back where you got it. And let's get out of here. -Oh, don't get nervous about a little killing. After you've been around a while it won't mean a thing to you. -Oh no? -Something tells me old Li See maybe knows plenty about that gold coin game. Maybe. -Oh, let's get out of here. Hey, where are we going? I don't like the looks of this street. -This is Lover's Lane. We're on the way to Li See's. -How do you spell it? Who was that meant for. -I don't know. But I've got a hunch we ought to keep walking. -Walking, what do you mean? Let's run. -What's the matter with you? Don't want people to think we're scared, do you? Of course I don't mind if we walk a little faster. Hey, Mac! -I'm working. Why don't you two kids go home? -Better run down to the Chinese restaurant. They just axed another Chinaman. -What? -Come on, you. You're going home. -That scared me, but I'm not going to walk. Call me a taxi. -In the middle of the ocean you ask for a taxi. All right. -Let's not go that way, though, it's too dark. -All right. [SCREAM] -Say, now this ceases to be a joke. -You're telling me. What a dent that would've made in some Chinaman's head. -Well, what about ours? What do you think they're made out of, cast iron? -Oh, don't be afraid. This is just as good a time as any. Taxi! Pedicab! Gee, honey. I hate to go without seeing Li See. It's a new angle I've got to this story. -All right. You write it and I'll read it at home in the morning. -Oh, there's nothing to be afraid of. Now, come on, be a good sport, will you? -Are you calling a cab or do I call Chuck Roberts? -Taxicab! We're at 510 [INAUDIBLE] Street. -Where? -America! -Thank goodness we're out of that mess. -What are you squawking about? You didn't get hurt, did you? -Oh, it's not your fault. I can always replace the hat, you know, but this is the only head I've got. -Oh, and what a head. What are you thinking about? -Chuck Roberts. -Why don't you? -What? -Chuck Roberts. -You can go now. -Oh, all right. If that's the way you feel about. I'm going to go back to see old Li See. I'm going to ask him a few questions. -After you talk to him, you're throat's cut. -Oh, driver. I like that. Will you do it again? Hey, what was that? Chloroform? Hey, darling. Hey, pull over there, will you, driver? You all right, darling? -Hey, I didn't know that fellow was on the running board. -Here, take this and keep the change. Take your little wagon. We'll walk. Come on, snap out of it, darling. -I want to go home. -I'm going to take you home right now, darling. -Thanks for the buggy ride. -[INAUDIBLE] man called Wong. You'll find him [INAUDIBLE] Li See's shop. -Here what he said, Peg? I've got to go to Li See's. You've got to go home alone. -I should say not. -I can't take you home now. This thing is red hot. -Who said I wanted to go home? I'm going to stay with you. I've got a couple of things to tell that Chinaman myself. -That a girl. -Gosh, it's dark in there. Maybe we ought to-- -Don't maybe me. [GONG] -Come on, let's get out of here. We can come back tomorrow. -I thought you had something really important to tell this guy. -I'll phone him. -Well, forget it. This is big. Say, we'll probably be written up ourselves on this story. -Yeah, but in what column? -Oh, don't be silly. Somebody home? Yeah, guess we'll have to give it up as a bad job. Old Li See's probably gone to bed. -You get me all the way down here and then you're going to walk out on me. -I never walked out a day in my life. [SCREAM] [SCREAM] -How am I doing? Good? -Ain't that something. Now would you go home? Look! Come on, let's go. Oh, no. Bring the totem poles. Clever people, these Chinese. -Think it's a trick? -Well, what do you think? -You'll have to think. I'm spinning. -It's a long wall, [INAUDIBLE]. Give me that. [GONG] [GASP] -What's that? -At the sound of the gong it will be exactly 10:41 Eastern Standard Time. Now will the children prefer to hear the story about the little bunny-- -Oh, don't be funny. Maybe that's a Tong gong? -A what? -A Tong gong. -Did you fall for the Chinese, too? -Oh, come on, this is no place for it. -So long, toots. [INAUDIBLE] -Come on, I've seen enough. -You haven't seen anything yet. We're going places. -Hey, we've been here before. -We have not. -We have, too. -Aw, you're crazy. -I'll bet you. -Come on, let's go. -Jay! Jay! -Peg? Where are you, Peg? -Jay! Oh, Jay darling. I'm so glad to see you. I walked around the corner. I was so scared-- hey, wait a minute. What are you trying to do? Get romantic in a joint like this? -Hello, here we are back again. Hi, you old tanner. I see you picked yourself up a wife. -That isn't the same one. -Sure it is, I'll prove it to you. -Don't touch it. -That's funny. [SCREAM] -Don't go in there. -Why not? -[INAUDIBLE] keeps me out. Pardon me, I hope we're not intruding. But would you mind telling me how we got here? Where are we? -We're in the house of-- -No talk. White devil. -Hey, do you hear what she called us? -Ah, what's the difference as long as we get the story. -We're in the house of Wong. -What'd I tell you, the house of Wong? -Wong great man. Someday Wong great emperor. -Ah. Did I have a hunch or did I have a hunch? -Hey, we'd better call the police. And get those poor policemen in trouble? -You would like to see Wong? -Don't tell. Secret. -I will. -Man be killed. You be tortured. Don't go! Don't go! -I am not afraid. -I've got a hunch we're heading for trouble. -Heading for it? We're in it. You want to go upstairs and stay with that servant woman. -And have you tell me I can't take it? Don't be silly. Jay! Look out! -[INAUDIBLE] never again. Take her to [INAUDIBLE]. I will attend to her later. -She was right. You are a devil. -Sometimes politeness is a virtue. Again, it is but a better part of judgment. -You're a fine one to talk about politeness. -Oh, so they got you, too, huh? -Oh, do forgive my lack of hospitality. Allow me, Mr. Newspaperman. May I present [INAUDIBLE], head of the secret service of Keelat. -Hey, where have I seen you before? -Hear nothing, see nothing-- -Speak nothing. Ah, I get you now. Hi ya, toots. -Smart young man. You wanted a story for your paper. And now you have it. But I cannot promise that you will ever print it. -Take it easy, take it easy. [GASP] -Hey, let her alone, will you? -I would not seclude you from so honorable an ally. You will remember that he, too, desires to discover Wong. -Yeah, we caught up with him, didn't we? -Your success may turn to bitterness. And you may wish you had not meddled with the affairs of Wong. -Jay, why don't you do something? -Yes. Perhaps-- you have a hunch? -As far as things I can think of that I'd like to do. -Then perhaps you are of the opinion that you alone are gifted with ideas? -Hey, listen. Would you mind telling me, what kind of a show is this you're putting on? -You Americans are always in such a hurry. Time came before man. There is plenty of it. Do not hurry. Haste is such a futile gesture. [GONG] -Little man, what now? -I've got a hunch. Think we're in a tight spot. -Clever people, these reporters. Ow! What are you doing? -If what I think is at the end of that cord, then I want to do plenty in the next few minutes. -What cord? -There's a phone. -Hello? Hello? -Hello. Connect me with Raymond, city editor of the Globe. Hurry, please. -White man got the coin. -How are you, honey? -Hello? -Hello, chief? This is Barton. Say, I'm somewhere back in old Li See's herb shop. There's a secret panel in back of the counter. It's a matter of life or death. Say, chief, you better come well heeled. These babies don't play with marbles. -Be hasty. -Get my that number back, quick. I was cut off. -You're still connected. -Big joy to witness my return? -Delighted. Too bad we couldn't [INAUDIBLE] throat. -Where have you hidden the sacred coin of Confucius? -Try and find out. -You're such a smart guy. -Watch that. Take it easy, now. -Hey, what are you doing?

Back off, hurry up. -Wong? Wong this way. -Come on. [SCREAM] -All right, darling. Now, wait a minute. All right, well we're all over now. Chief, I'm going to be fair with you. This is the first time I've ever been glad to see you. -So who's you're companion here [INAUDIBLE]. -Oh, yes. I want you to meet [INAUDIBLE], secret agent of the province of Keelat. -The coins of Confucius will never fall into the hands of Wong. Wong has gone to join his ancestors. -I knew I'd get this thing straightened out. -Girl, I've got a hunch. -What? -Scratch my back, will you? Oh. Ooh. Say, listen. Can I call you by my last name? -I'll think it over. -Well, would you marry me? Don't you love me? -I guess I could learn to. -How long it'll take you to get started? It's 11:30 now.
