(ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Wrong bathroom, Huckleberry. You mean Marie. (ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Okay class, I want to hear your pitches for our special video project so discuss with your partners. Any questions? Hey, Jolene, did you do anything fun last night? I just partied with Clint. Cool. So what do you want to do with this thing? I'm thinking we should knock this out tonight so what do you say I pick you up? Okay. Okay, Huckleberry, your group's up first, so what are you planning? Oh, what's up, Miss H, you starting with the back of the class? That violates tradition. I also wear white after Labor Day. You, ma'am, are a renegade. Ready when you are. We are going to film something beautiful that is available to us all the time but is beauty we may not notice or appreciate because we're preoccupied with our lives and our work, boyfriends, girlfriends, routines, stuff like that. Okay, can you tell me what that something is? I don't want to spoil the surprise, I kinda got a big buildup going here, but you're gonna love it, trust me. Okay, you two, I look forward to it. That sounds awesome, what are we filming? I have no idea, I just made that up. [WOMAN] Miss Hamilton, please send Marie Golden to the principal's office immediately. You heard it. That's not my name. Come on, Huckleberry. (CLASS MURMURS) (BELL RINGS) All I need, Wash, you got to get the same cut as me. Yeah, yeah, so I'm gonna get that, but I'm gonna go sell something to Lavon now, all right? Uh, okay, you're not gonna walk me to practice. Ah, good Camille, and it looks much better on you obviously. Yo yo, what's up, bro? How you doing? How you living man, you good? Yo, your girl looks pissed every day all the time. It's cool, man, also she's not my girl, right? Does she know that? Ah, she'll figure it out eventually. (WIND CHIME TINKLES) Why do you put on so much makeup? Ma, seriously. I ain't got time for this. I'm meeting up with Clint in like five minutes. Well, honey, you should know you look like a whore.

Listen, somebody broke into my apartment, covered the place in smiley face stickers and... [JOLENE] (laughs) Are you high? Listen, somebody poured sugar in the gas tank and told me to have a nice day. You know what, Clint, I don't give a fuck. I'm done with you, I've been thinking, and we're done, finished, don't call me anymore. Do you even know what I'm going through here? I don't give a shit, bitch, don't call me! Jolene, Jolene!

He totally broke into Clint's house and beat the crap out of him. [WOMAN] Marie Golden to the principal's office. (HUCKLEBERRY SIGHS) (SOMBER MUSIC) Have a seat, Marie. That's not my name, that hasn't been my name for six years. Did you know the entire time that you've known me at this school, that has never been my name? Sit down. (SOMBER ELECTRONIC MUSIC) There are some interesting rumors circulating about you. So? Anything you want to tell me? Not particularly. What's your relationship to Clinton Sloane? - There is none. - Marie. Huckleberry, if we were friends, which we are not, you could call me Huck. So defiant. With all due respect, Principal Anderson, you can call me Mr. Golden from now on. (SOMBER ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Last chance to tell me what happened or you're suspended pending investigation. Is that even a thing? Oh it is, if I say it is. I have nothing to say to you. (SOMBER ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Last chance, Miss Golden. Fuck you. Well then. Huck. You're suspended for a week for cursing at your principal. (LAUGHS) Great, is that it? Get the fuck out of my office. (SOMBER ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Huck. 'Sup. Nothing much, you wanna tell me why you went crazy and tried to kill Clint? Who told you that? Everyone's talking about it. Erin said she heard you broke into his apartment. Heard from who? Wow, I don't see you denying it. Yo, I heard you just beat Clint's ass, that's awesome. - How is that awesome? - Because he sucks. All right, let's just drop it, y'all, please. What happened? Nothing, okay, I was waiting for the bus and Clint got off and came after me so I socked him. Missed the bus, end of story. So you were just nowhere near where you lived waiting for a bus. Where was your truck? Rick's truck wasn't available. Where were you going? Hey, man, told you what happened, just leave it alone. That's it. Whatever. Don't you want a ride? Nah, I think I'll just take the bus. Lay low, Huck. Lay low, Huck, that is some dumb shit. That's all they do, I mean, what's Clint gonna do anyways, brag about getting his ass beat by a... I'm just saying, he's not gonna brag about getting his ass beat and cokeheads don't go to the cops anyway so you good, bro. What about Jolene? What about her? You are Huckleberry Golden, all right? Chicks get wet about that fighting for their honor shit. I don't know. Well, shit, I do, I'm getting wet just thinking about it. Nah, look, anyways, swing by tonight, and don't stress this shit, man, you good, all right? - Okay, sure. - All right. - Get home safe. - You too. (PHONE RINGS) (ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRONIC MUSIC) What? Hey. Hey, Jolene. What the fuck do you want? Look, I don't know what... Who the fuck do you think you are, huh? I did it for you, I would do anything to protect you. I don't need some chick to fight my battles for me. I'm not some chick. (SOMBER MUSIC) Huckleberry. I got to go. He doesn't deserve you. And you do? Yes, I... I'd die for you, Jolene. (SOMBER ELECTRONIC MUSIC) (JOLENE SIGHS) (PHONE CLATTERS) Huckleberry, what the heck? You all right? I'm fine. [RICK] What was that? Nothing. All right, well, you want me to make you something to eat? No thanks, I'm good. - Cook you a burger? - No, Rick. - Cut up that pie for you. - I'm fine. All right.

You think Huckleberry'll call me back, bear? (JOLENE SIGHS) (SOMBER ELECTRONIC MUSIC) [HUCKLEBERRY] Fuck you! (SOMBER ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Huck, get up, Huck, Huck, Huck, wake up, Huck, wake up, Huck, hey, hey! (SOMBER ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Help me, help me, please! Wake up, Huck! (SOBS) Somebody help me, please! Somebody help please! Somebody please! (SOMBER ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Okay, son. Why don't you just make this easy on yourself and tell me exactly what happened? I was watching TV and I heard a scream so I ran outside and then I looked down the back and he's lying there, bleeding. He. Huckleberry was lying there bleeding. Okay. So do you know of anyone that would have wanted to hurt your friend? I don't know man. You know what, I would think hard if I were you. Hey. (KNOCKS) Clint, maybe. Okay, so who is Clint? Clint is Jolene's boyfriend, he's a dirt bag, you know, him and Huck had beef. So does this Clint have a last name? Piece of shit asshole, he drives a stupid ass Camaro and he lives down the shady fucking apartments on Main, man, you know which one I'm talking about. I found a pager, she just received a text from one Jolene Graham. (SOMBER ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Now would that be our Jolene? Look, man, can I get to the hospital now? Nah, nah, I don't think so, I think I want to take a few minutes and go visit this Clint fella. You just need to show me exactly where he lives. Can I at least get a shirt? Oh yeah, sure man, we'll go to the police station lost and found afterwards, how's that sound? You sure about that, boss? Aw come on, what the hell? Detectives are here, they've got their hands full. We'll have a little fun, it'll only take a few minutes. (SOMBER ELECTRONIC MUSIC) (POLICEMAN KNOCKS) Sheriff's office. (SOMBER ELECTRONIC MUSIC) What happened here? (EERIE MUSIC) Oh, and don't forget to bring me some evidence bags. I didn't even do anything. I don't want to hear it, just get in the car. Look, I don't even know that crazy bitch. (WILL PANTS) I could fuck you up right now. (PANTS) See? It was a productive trip anyways. I mean, why let the detectives have all the fun, huh? You were right. Let that be a lesson to you, son, let that be a lesson. Okay, boys, you ready? Let's go. (PHONE RINGS) (TONI KNOCKS) - Who is it? - Jolene, phone for you, it's your fucking boyfriend. I ain't got no fucking boyfriend. Just get the damn phone. We got you an extra line so I wouldn't have to deal with this shit, make sure he calls that next time. There won't be a next time. This was sitting on the stoop for you. A thank you would be nice. Thank you, Ma. What do you want? Hey, look, I need your help. Are you fucking kidding me? Look, they think I attacked that dyke Huckleberry last night. They won't let me leave, they wanna hear it all again. What are you talking about? - You don't know? - Know what? Apparently somebody, I don't know who, attacked her last night, she's in a coma or maybe dead or something, I don't know. What do you mean, maybe dead? I don't know, look, the cops are trying to pin this shit on me, and I need you to tell them that you were with me at my apartment last night, just us. I ain't doing that shit. Jolene, look, I promise you, okay, I'm fucking begging you here. I need you to do this for me. For us. (DIAL TONE BUZZES) (ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRONIC MUSIC) (HOSPITAL EQUIPMENT BEEPS SLOWLY) Mr. Golden, I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to ask you a few questions about your daughter, Huckleberry, is that her given name or is that a nickname? First of all, Huckleberry's my foster kid. Me and my ex brought him in a few years back and my last name's Stevens, not Golden. Oh. My bad. They also told me, the social worker did, to call him he instead of she, but I guess his birth mother helped him change it a while back. Is the mother around, maybe we should talk with her. They told me she died. I see, and his given name? I heard people say Marie a few times, but I never really asked about it. And honestly I don't know who Huckleberry hangs out with or what he gets into. Huckleberry just pretty much takes care of himself. That do it for you? That's fine, Rick, we'll be in touch. Let's go talk to that Jolene girl. - Come on. - Sounds good. (SOMBER MUSIC) Jolene, are you sure you want to present this today? Okay. For our project, Huckleberry wanted to show us a glimpse of beauty. That's often overlooked. (SOMBER MUSIC) (POLICEMAN KNOCKS) (KID LAUGHS) (SOMBER MUSIC) (HUCKLEBERRY SIGHS) Jolene. You have to understand, I did this for you. I would do anything to keep you safe. You can't let guys like Clint get away with it. I was taking care of it. [TEACHER] Jolene, this officer would like to speak with you. I love you. I'm gonna need that tape. (SOMBER MUSIC) Thank you. (SOMBER MUSIC) (BELL RINGS) (JOLENE SIGHS) What's that asshole got you mixed up in, Jolene? Nothing. What have I told you about him? Mom, please, I really don't want to hear it. Well, you're gonna hear it, I'm not gonna sit by and watch you waste your life on someone like him. Well I'm not with him. You just talked to him this morning. So? (JOLENE SIGHS) Jolene, you need to hear this. God. I'm sorry your father is dead. (SIGHS) The fuck, why would you even bring that up? I'm sorry he's dead, he was an okay dad but he was a fucking asshole to me and you know it. - Oh God. - And divorcing him was the best thing I ever did. Jesus Christ, Ma, what the fuck are you even talking about? All I want for you is to find someone who'll treat you right. Not to waste your life like I did. (SIGHS) I didn't mean that. - Uh huh. - Jolene, get back in the car. No, I'm walking home. (SIGHS) Dammit. (SIGHS) Screw it. (PHONE BEEPS) (JOLENE SNIFFLES) (PHONE RINGS) Hello? Hey, Jolene, it's Lavon. Hey, have you heard anything about Huckleberry? No, just whatever they announced in school. Oh, okay. So have you spoken with Clint at all? Why do you care what he says? I know, I'm just trying to wrap my head around this. What did the cops say to you? Lavon, I really can't handle this shit right now. Look, I just need to figure this out. Goddammit. (SOBS) Clint says he ain't done it, okay, but he also told me to lie to the cops about where he is so (SIGHS) you tell me. Do you believe him? I don't think so, I. I mean, let's be honest, he wasn't the only person that hated Huckleberry in this town. You know what, Lavon, I really can't handle this shit right now, okay? All right, all right, I'm sorry. I'll see you in class. (PHONE BEEPS) (JOLENE SIGHS) (ATMOSPHERIC MUSIC) (HOSPITAL MACHINES BEEP SLOWLY) (JOLENE SIGHS) Hey. (ATMOSPHERIC MUSIC) (SOMBER MUSIC) (MAN SNORTS) What do you want for the 64? Man, I can get a hundred for that, easy. I'll give you 20 bucks and a line. Nah, man, I need more than that. 10 bucks and a line, final offer. Fine. (MAN LAUGHS) (SOMBER MUSIC) (MAN KNOCKS) - Shit. - Open up. We have a warrant for your arrest. Come on, we got to get rid of that shit, Clint. (POLICEMAN BANGS ON DOOR) [MAN] Open the door now. - Clint! - On the count of five. Coming in, five, go, go, go, now. (DOOR SQUEAKS) Clint Sloane, we have a warrant for your arrest. So you know the drug, you stay there, don't move, don't move. (SOMBER MUSIC) You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will... Hey, hey, hey, watch his face, that's evidence. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law, you have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you, do you understand? Got it, okay, good, nice job. Bring 'em in, put your hands behind your back, now, now, now, now! Just go. (JOLENE SIGHS) Want some help? It's okay, I got it. These places don't know what they're doing. You've done this before? Yeah. My dad was in a place like this. After his accident. Is Huck coming to? What? (HUCK GROANS) Relax, just relax. Go get the nurse. [HUCKLEBERRY] Where am I? You're awake. You're okay. Huckleberry was talking, yeah, yeah. All right, Rick, I'll see you here soon, okay? All right, bye. (PHONE RINGS) Yes. Hello? Yeah, man, 'sup? Huck just got out of the coma. That's great. All right, so I guess I'll be there as soon as I can. Yeah, all right, bye. Yeah, later. Huck came out of the coma. That's great. Yeah. Do you want a ride to the hospital? - After this game. - Okay. Once you're done cheating at the game. Huckleberry. I need to tell you something. I know now probably isn't the best time. It's fine, you can tell me anything. I need to tell you what happened that day that you picked me up. [CLINT] So how long have you known? I just took the test this morning. [CLINT] You're sure? I know how to read a pregnancy test. [CLINT] Well you didn't take a second one? It doesn't matter. I'm really late. [CLINT] What the fuck, Jolene? What the fuck yourself? [CLINT] So what are you gonna do? I don't know. [CLINT] Well, you have to have it. I don't have to do anything. [CLINT] Goddammit, Jolene, you know, you're such a fucking idiot, you know that? I don't know that I want to have your kid. (SOMBER MUSIC) Well then get the fuck out of my car. Get the fuck off me! (DOOR SLAMS) (DISTORTED ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Fuck you! (JOLENE COUGHS) (JOLENE SOBS) Are you still pregnant? (JOLENE SOBS) It's gonna be okay. (JOLENE SOBS) Did you hear the news? What? That girl. She's out of the coma. Isn't that great? That is wonderful news, yes. (LAUGHS) Okay. See you later. (EERIE MUSIC) Dad! Dad, we were just. [HUCKLEBERRY] Studying for a play. - What? - Dad, no, Dad... - I'm gonna kill you. - Stop! - I'm gonna kill you! - Stop! - What were you just doing? - We were doing nothing. [MAN] You were not just doing nothing. - Daddy. - Why are you not dressed? - I am dressed. - You are not dressed. What the hell is going on? - You are overreacting. - I am not overreacting. That is a girl, that is a girl! (SOMBER MUSIC) Huck. You're awake. - Hey man. - The cops are outside waiting to talk to you. Yeah, we know, dude. I'm ready. Come on in. How are you feeling? Got a massive headache, but otherwise I'm okay. Can we make this brief, officers? Sure, all right, then, let's get to it. Why don't you tell us what you remember from the night of the attack? Okay. I was leaving Will's house and I was walking down the path and someone in a ski mask attacked me. Did they say anything to you? No, they just came up and all of a sudden was swinging at me with a tire iron. Then what happened? I managed to pull off his mask and that's the last thing I saw before I blacked out. So you saw him? Wait, wait, wait, did you see who it was? Clint Sloane. Are you sure it was Clint, Huck? Dude, what is your problem? He's just asking a question. Huckleberry, if your story's being coerced, now is the time to tell us. All right, now, let's just settle down, okay? Are you sure that it was Clint that you saw? I'm positive, it's etched in my mind. That's good enough for me, unless you have some questions. I'm good. Good, thank you. Can we have a minute alone? All right, come on, let's leave Huck alone for a minute. You know, I can always tell when you're lying, Huckleberry. You don't know how it is. Oh I don't, really? Okay, Huck, take care of yourself. I hope she's worth it. (SOMBER MUSIC) I heard what you said. That wasn't for your ears. Hey, don't come back here anymore, man. Go fuck yourself, bro. Don't worry about him, dude, he doesn't know what happened. What happened? What happened is what you said happened. Clint attacked you, twice. Once at the bus stop and then again with the tire iron at the path. That's what happened, he was just jealous 'cause you took his girl. You believe that? Yes I do, everybody knows that's what happened. Me, Jolene, everyone. Okay. (SOMBER MUSIC) How you holding up? Can we just cut to the chase? Clinton, as you know, this plea bargain comes with strings attached. What strings? First and foremost, you absolutely cannot violate the restraining order put in place by Jolene Graham, you cannot call or have any correspondence with her at all. But she needs to know the truth. Clinton, I'm explaining the plea bargain to you, okay, this is non negotiable. So what's the plea? Five years with the possibility of parole after three years. Or? Or we can go to trial with myself or another public defender. If you're found guilty, you're most likely looking at 20 years for attempted murder plus the drug charges. What about the three months I've already been in here? Counts as time served. It's a good plea bargain, I've fought hard for it. Frankly, you're lucky it's on the table. Don't think either party wants this to go to trial. What about the hair that was in the ski mask that didn't match mine? Honestly, yeah, it doesn't matter, they got your prints on the weapon and a positive ID from the victim. It is what it is. - This is bullshit. - It's a good deal. (SOMBER MUSIC) Just give me the pen. (SOMBER MUSIC) Great. (SOMBER MUSIC) A full stop. What? I came to a full stop. That's good. Have you? Yes. Good. (SOMBER MUSIC) - Hey baby. - Hey. How was work? Work was work. But now I'm here, with you. And you. (JOLENE LAUGHS) (ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Daddy's home. (ELECTRONIC MUSIC)
