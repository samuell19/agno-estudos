( SQUEAKY VIOLIN ) Happy anniversary. Really, that was amazing. You're already so much better than Mommy ever was. Nuh-uh. Ya, hah. Barbara, thanks for doing the night shift. Can we get you anything while we're out? Barbara? Look, we need to go. You have a wonderful time now. Thank you. We'll be back by 11. Mrs. Highsmith? Yes, dear. I'm hungry. Can we have macaroni and cheese? Macaroni and cheese, of course. MARK: ( CHUCKLES ) I open the boxes. They are full of broken tiles... Aw. Broken tiles, and I'm like what the... I'm not paying for this. Ma'am, for you. Oh, that's not for us, thank you. Uh, no, it is for us. Mark, it's too much. Just let me splurge on one romantic evening, hm? We're going to have to drink the whole bottle to make it worth it. I can live with that. Cheers, to us. To us. Wow, she already got back to me. I was thinking that it would be nice to have just one night where we could actually sit here and not worry about your phone, not have in the middle of dinner your phone be more important... I know, I know. I'm here. You're not here. You're actually still in your office. I'm here. Oh dear. Mrs. Highsmith? Now what are we doing here? Making dinner. Right. Dinner. Here, I'll help. You just pour the macaroni in the water. BARBARA: No, it's too hot. Just watch. No, it's too hot! ( SCREAMS ) ( PHONE RINGS ) Go on. No, no. You should answer it. Well, I'm having a nice dinner with my husband. It can wait. Just answer the phone, please. Yes. Chloe, oh my God! ( indistinct ) Mommy! How did this happen? Uh, it seems like your babysitter got a little disoriented while she was cooking. Wait, I don't understand. What do you mean "disoriented"? Where is she? She's in the dining room collecting her thoughts. The signs of dementia are very clear. I think it's best if I take her to the hospital for a checkup. Oh, geez. Sorry. Can I have a moment? Barbara... Linda, I, I'm so sorry. I, I don't know what happened. You need to see a doctor. No. No, Chloe needs a doctor. She... Chloe's okay. May I tuck her in? Barbara, I'm sorry. You can't watch Chloe anymore. ( SOBS ) You need help. ( SOBS ) I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. ( SOBS ) You feel okay? It tickles and hurts at the same time. Okay. This might help. Here you go. Got it? Is Mrs. Highsmith going to be fine? Yeah. You're so sweet to think of her. She's going to be fine. Who's going to take care of me now? MARK: You know what I'm going to suggest... and you're not going to like it. Yeah, so don't even suggest it, Mark. I mean, as much as I love the idea of watching Chloe full-time, it's just not realistic I quit my job. We have no income. MARK: Look, all I need is a few more weeks to finish the renovations on the house. We can then flip it and triple our investment. In the meantime, we have no savings to live off of. All of our money is tied up in that house. All right. Well, look... let's not get all doom and gloom, okay? I know. We just need to find a new babysitter-- someone who's younger, who can keep up with Chloe. I don't know though. I don't like the idea of trusting a teenage kid with our daughter. Well, after tonight, I don't like the idea of trusting anyone with our daughter, but we... we've got no choice. REYNOLDS: And the Fisher account? Well, they loved the 30-second TV spot, but they want to see our plans for online. Then show them. Next, we need somebody to spearhead the Hooper account. Any ideas on how to push canned spaghetti in the age of gluten-free, fat-free foods? Pasta bits-- almost as good for you as eating the tin can it comes in. Actually I think the can has some iron in it. I think we should show the product as a staple of the American meal, and Hooper's been around since the '50s, so I was thinking family dinners through the years, all featuring the spaghetti. Hooper means family. Could be good. Gary, maybe you should help her-- I got it. I, I can handle it, sir. All right then. Let's go to work. So, how'd the meeting go? I'm leading up the Hooper account. Yes, you are! You rock, woman! Reynolds totally tried to push Gary on me. Oh, please. Gary couldn't sell fur to an Eskimo. Here, would you proof these for me? You got it! Let me guess... you still haven't found a babysitter. What's it been-- like three weeks? I think I need to rewrite the ad. I just keep getting these terrible responses. Hm. What's a subtle way of saying mean girls need not apply? Hm. Let's see. Must love books. Brilliant. All right. That was easy. ( GIGGLES ) So who's been watching Chloe? Yeah. Mark's held back on the renovations just until we find someone. Hm. I just don't want to rush it. We've got to find the right person for Chloe. Oh my God! I know what you need-- a nanny cam. Hmmpf. Right, no. Are those things even legal? Totally. I just got one for Peppy and Trish. Check it out. There's this little spy shop on Fifth. LINDA: Yeah, but if I get the right person, I won't even need... Well, what's she got in his mouth there? What? I don't... Oh my God! My Ferragamos! Tricia, you little bitch! ( SIGHS ) Hey, could I leave a little early for lunch today-- this is kind of an emergency. Sure. Thank you. ( SAWING ) Sweetie, what did I tell you about coming up here while I'm working? Can we go home? Ten minutes, all right, and then we'll get some ice cream. Fine. All right. So why don't you go wait out back and don't touch anything. Okay. Okay. ( SAWING ) ♪ I'm so bored ♪ ♪ This is boring ♪ ♪ I think I'm going to die Because I'm so bored ♪ ♪ How much longer La la la ♪ ♪ My only two pals Are a leaf and stick ♪ ♪ I think I'm so bored that Someone needs to call 9-1-- ♪ Whoa! ( SAWING ) Daddy, I made a friend. Well, what did we say about collecting bugs? Heather's not a bug. I was just walking by and I saw this little one playing with your nail gun. Ah. This is not a toy. Are you okay? Uh-huh. But it looks like she had a little accident. ( SIGHS ) Oh, yes. That was about a month ago. Macaroni and cheese incident. Oh, you poor thing. The kids at school call it my monster skin. Well, you know what I think? I think they're saying that because they're jealous. Um, why? Well, because it's your mark, only you have it. Really? HEATHER: Yes. And that makes you special. Yeah. No, it's a Chloe mark. Exactly. You see, I have a Heather mark. Did you spill macaroni and cheese? No, uh, my mark came from a boy. From a boy? Really? HEATHER: Uh-hm. Take it from me, Chloe, don't get involved with bad boys. ( GIGGLES ) ( FOOTSTEPS ) MARK ( DEEP BREATH ): What is that? ( MUFFLED SOUNDS ) ( GIGGLES ) ( MUFFLED SOUNDS ) Oh, oh, I know this one. ( GIGGLES ) And then this one, this one, this one. Hello. MARK: You're back early. Hi. MARK: This is Heather. LINDA: Hi. Nice to meet you, Mrs. Kessler. She helped out today with Chloe at the site, and they got off to a great start, right, and it just so happens that she's looking for a babysitting job. Is that so? I'm trying to earn a bit before going to college next year. Chloe, sweetheart, why don't you take Heather and show her your room while Mommy and I talk? Okay. Come with me. Okay. Hi. Hi. I just posted a new ad. We have a whole lot of other options to sort through. You know, I'm done reading emails and resumes, and besides, she lives right in town and she's great. But, but we don't know who she is. Let's get to know her, right? I've got to finish this job. The longer that house sits, the more money we're losing. I don't know, and Mark, you've been great. I know it's been hard, I just-- I'm having a hard time trusting someone right now. I know, but you've got to start sometime. Okay. We'll get to know her. Ask her to stay for a few minutes. We'll check her out. All right. Come here. So what is it you plan on studying? Developmental psychology. Um, I want to help people understand their lives by examining past experiences. Wow, that's pretty heavy stuff. Well, I was never really good at numbers and figures. Chloe told me about your last sitter, Mrs. Highsmith. That must have been just awful for all of you. It was a big scare. Well, I can assure you that nothing like that has ever happened under my watch. So you do have babysitting experience? Oh, yes. Um-- You can call the McCready family for a reference. I used to sit for them after school. You both work full-time? Yes. We both work full-time, so we really need someone to help out before and after school. Of course. What do you do, Mrs. Kessler? I'm an executive at an advertising agency in the city. Wow, hm. You don't see many career-driven women in this town. I really admire that. All right, um, Heather, thank you, and uh, we'll be in touch. It's very nice to meet you. It's my pleasure. Chloe seems like an amazing little girl, and I hope to get to know her better. You're going to bring your violin to school tomorrow, okay? Okay. Mommy? Uh-hm. Can Heather be my new babysitter? MARK: Yeah, Mom, can she? We'll see, kids. ( SIGHS ) ( WHISPERS ) Please? Pretty please? ( WHISPERS ) You really like her, huh? ( WHISPERS ) Please, pretty please. ( GIGGLES ) MRS. McCREADY: Hello. Hello, Mrs. McCready? Um, my name is Linda Kessler. I'm calling about Heather Lambert. She interviewed with me today for a babysitting position. MRS. McCREADY: Oh, Heather. She's an absolute doll, isn't she? She seems great, and she listed you as a reference, so I was just checking to ask how she was. MRS. McCREADY: I've got three kids and work two jobs. I don't know what I would have done without her. I only let her go because my oldest took on the babysitting duties. And your kids liked her? MRS. McCREADY: They adore her. Still talk about her every day. That's great to hear. MRS. McCREADY: She's a lifesaver. You found yourself a good one. Okay, all right. Thank you. Thanks for your time, Mrs. McCready. MRS. McCREADY: Anytime. That was Heather's reference. Oh yeah? It was a glowing review. Sold! Yeah, but it's still a stranger's review of a stranger-- which is why I think we should get a home surveillance system. A nanny cam? ( GIGGLES ) You've been watching Nancy Grace again, haven't you? They're totally normal. No, they're totally crazy. No. And creepy. Lots of people use them. Lots of people are crazy and creepy. Yeah, but Mark, after what happened I just, I just don't want to take any chances. You know, a hidden camera could not prevent dementia. I know, but I just can't stop feeling like I missed the signs that night. It's not your fault. I know. All I'm saying is that as great as Heather seems, we still just don't know her, and a little extra security couldn't hurt. Well, I mean, you know how much I detest the NSA and all that Big Brother crap, but if it makes you feel more comfortable, we shall get a nanny cam. I'm going to call Heather. Okay. ( SIGHS ) This is Heather. Heather, it's Linda Kessler. Oh, hi, Mrs. Kessler. How are you? I'm, I'm great. Um, so look, if you're still interested, we would love to have you watch Chloe. Hello? That's wonderful! Just wonderful. Thank you so much. No, thank you. I, I, I know it's last minute, but could you start tomorrow? Whenever you need me, I'm there. All right, so you could pick up Chloe at the bus stop on our corner at 3. HEATHER: Thank you so much, Mrs. Kessler. You won't regret it. Monster skin, monster skin. Chloe has monster skin. It makes me special. Specially ugly. ( BIKE BELL RINGS ) Tell her she's special. You're, you're special. No, tell her she's special. You, you're special. Good. Ready to walk home? Uh-hm. I was so happy when Mommy told me you're going to be my new babysitter, Heather. Oh, me too. We're going to have so much fun. So what are we going to do on our first day? Well, you want to show me your room. I'm sure you've got loads of cool stuff. Yeah. I have all, I have all these photo albums of all my cool adventures. ( FOOTSTEPS ) MAN: So, uh, what's the difference? STORE CLERK: Oh, so with the night vision, it amplifies natural lighting whereas the infrared has no color but provides you with a monochromatic image. So that means, uh... Do you want it for hunting or do you want it for peeping? Oh, ( CHUCKLES ), no. I'm no stalker. I'm just-my wife, she's having a little bit of a problem. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. This one's gonna work. I'll be right with you. Thank you. CLERK: Thank you, sir. Have a nice night. Hi. Hi. Uh, could you tell me, uh, how long do these nanny cams record for. CLERK: Oh, you get up to 80 hours on a single SD card. Oh, and that's good picture and audio? Oh, in this state, it's illegal to record audio without two-party consent. We do have a series of cameras that will do that. No, no. That's okay. I think video will be fine. Okay. Here is our best seller, Mr. Peepers. Camera goes right here. You just set this up in the nursery or play room. I'd be worried I'd just catch my daughter having tea parties. Yeah, that'd be awful. Next we have the alarm clock radio. Oh, does it really tell time? Wouldn't be much of a hidden device if it was flashing 12 o'clock all day long, would it? Sorry, stupid question. Then we have our fire alarm series. These do record audio. And it's a fire detector. Well, no. If there was an actual fire, all this would do is record you burning alive. I'll get the alarm clock. CLERK: I'll get a box. Hm. I still actually cannot believe that we are doing this. Oh, we're just going to try it out. We can always return it. So apparently you can log in to a remote feed from any computer or phone and you can watch live or recorded video. Oh. Ah! Oh, whoa! Guess it works. Yeah! ( GIGGLES ) What, are you like a caveman-- you've never seen a camera? ( GIGGLES ) Hold on now. Let me just... Let me try something. I just want to make sure... Let me just hold on a sec. Did it get that? Yes. It did? Yeah. Okay, what about ( KISSES ) that? No, it didn't. It missed that. ( KISSES ) Hm? Hm? Hm? ( GIGGLES ) ( GROWLS ) Oh, thank you. Yeah. Boom! Oh! Head first. I meant to do that. Hey, how about some iced tea? Oh, extra sugar! Okay. But don't tell Mommy. Okay. Oh, hi, Mrs. Highsmith. Are you feeling better? Chloe, you've already grown so much I hardly recognized you! I grew a centimeter this month. BARBARA: Isn't that something! I miss you so much. CHLOE: Me too. Chloe, you shouldn't talk to strangers. But Mrs. Highsmith isn't a stranger. She's my old babysitter. Why don't you go inside and set up Snakes and Ladders, hm? Okay. Bye, Mrs. Highsmith. Nice to see you. BARBARA: They're such a lovely family, aren't they? I miss them so much. You're not getting them back. They hate you for what you did. You scarred that poor little girl for life, physically and emotionally. Shame on you! They tell me every day how grateful they are to have me because their last sitter was a worthless old bitch who couldn't take care of herself. ( SOBS ) Oh, no, no, no. You don't understand. It was an accident, just an accident. LINDA: Barbara, Barbara! What happened? I don't know. ( SOBS ) She just came up to me and started screaming about how I stole her job and I didn't mean to. Oh, I'm so sorry. She's a very sick woman. I really just want to do a good job for you. You're doing a great job, really. We're so happy with you. In fact would you like to stay for dinner tonight? I'd like that very much. Great! Chloe? Hi sweetie-- oh! What happened, I'm here. ( indistinct ) So do you have any brothers or sisters? No, um, I'm an only child, like Chloe. Did you ever want more children? Can I have fruit snacks? After dinner, sweetie. ( SIGHS ) Sometimes one feels like ten. I want four. Wow! Yeah, that way, each brother and sister has a best friend. You seem a little young to be thinking about a family. People used to start families much sooner, and the larger the group, the more people there are to look out for each other. I feel like we've lost that kind of connection. Sorry, you must think I'm so weird. No, I think you're a smart young woman who thinks a lot about her future. What were you like at my age, Mrs. Kessler? Not like you. No, I mean that as a compliment. I was nowhere near as mature or thoughtful. I made a lot of mistakes. ( CHLOE SCREAMS ) ( GIGGLES ) M-m-m-m, it smells good in here. Well, it did until you walked in, sweaty man. You love it. So Heather, have you seen Chloe? I'm right here! MARK: Where is she? Oh, wait a second. What is this thing? There she is. Hi. Puzzle time! Puzzle time it is. All right, let's do it. Here we go. ( GROWL ) You know, I have to say, sweetheart, you are kind of like a wizard at this. CHLOE: Heather taught me a little trick. MARK: Oh yeah, what's that? CHLOE: You just have to look real close at the little details. People don't look close enough to see the whole picture. Wow, that is a really smart observation. ( PHONE RINGS ) I'll get it. Linda? It's Barbara. I never had the chance to truly apologize. I've been so ashamed, but I need you to know how sorry I am. Your family means the world to me. My family would be much better off if you'd just hurry up and die. ( BARBARA GASPS ) ( DISCONNECTS PHONE ) Those telemarketers have no manners, always calling at dinnertime. Bunch of bottom-feeders. Daddy, what's a bottom-feeder? MARK: Hm, all right. Well, it is a monster who digs its claws into you and drains the life out of you. And on that pleasant note, bon appétit. Thank you so much for having me at your table. It really is an honor. How was your day? We saw Mrs. Highsmith. Yeah. Had a really strange run-in with Barbara. She was on the lawn yelling at Heather. You all right? Sure, I mean, she scared me a little. LINDA: Yeah, I think she's just not herself anymore. Poor thing. I'll call her first thing in the morning. I think she'd like that. WOMAN ( ON TV ): He done it, he just done it. MAN ( ON TV ): You have testified that he choked you and he beat you. You didn't say that he sneaked up behind you and knocked you out cold. ( SQUEAKING FLOORBOARDS ) But that you turned around and there he was. You want to tell us what really happened? ( TICKING CLOCK ) WOMAN ( ON TV ): I got somethin' to say. ( HOWLING WIND ) ...Know nothin' about it, then you're just a bunch of lousy, yella... ( SQUEAKING FLOORBOARDS ) ( DOOR OPENS ) Hello? Is anybody out there? ( DOOR CLOSES ) Great. All right, let's just make sure there's printed copies already in the conference room for them. SECRETARY: Done. Linda Kessler's office. It's the Derry police. They want to speak with you. ( LAUGHTER ) ( SIGHS ) Daddy, Daddy! Wow, oh, oh, ho! Thank you for that soaking-wet hug. Come for lunch? No, I just forgot the uh, my, uh, screwdriver. We're having hot dogs and beans. Alright. I already ate. Thank you though. Thank you. Is everything okay? Uh, yeah, everything's... No. Um, Chloe's old babysitter... she passed away. Oh my God! She must have been really sick, huh? Suicide. Linda, that's awful. Are you, are you okay? Uh, are the Hooper people--they're here? Yeah, everyone's in the conference room now. Hey, we don't have to do this. We can reschedule. I mean, this is just the first meet and greet. No, let's do this. Okay. CHLOE: I don't understand. How did she die? I don't know. I don't know. I think she just got really sick really fast and had another accident. But we just saw her the other day. I know. Heather, this is an odd question, but when the two of you spoke, did you say anything that might have upset her unin-- unintentionally? N-no, I mean, she did most of the talking and she wasn't making much sense. You know, I hear that-- ( WHISPERS ) I hear that suicide is pretty common amongst dementia patients. I didn't say it was suicide. Mommy, will you give these to her from me? Of course, baby. "You had the scarlet fever, haven't you, Joe? "Oh, Joe, the baby's dead. Mrs. Hummel's baby. It died in my lap just before she got home." Very good. Now, do you want to do the other part that I showed you? "She's lying there on mother's bed. "It feels better. "The baby's death troubled her, but I dare say she has only got cold." LINDA: Okay, sounds good. All right. I'll see you first thing. All right. Bye-bye. Oh, hey, by the way, I saw Dana Abrams when you were picking up the car. I'm glad I missed her. Hm. You know, her son Will was there too. He's a senior at Derry high. He says he's never even heard of Heather. He's also lost half his brain cells on the football field, but I bet Dana's very proud of his scholarship, so... No, I'm serious. Don't you think it's kind of weird? It's a big school, and I'm sure that he's still fantasized about her from afar, but... Very nice, Mark. Wow! She cleaned the whole house? Talk about above and beyond. These I've not seen in awhile. I put Chloe down for a nap and she had a nightmare, so she asked me to stay with her, and I guess I must have fallen asleep. Heather, did you clean the whole house and do all the laundry? Um, well, she passed out pretty early before the nightmare I mean, and um, I was just feeling so antsy that I thought I'd make the most of my energy. You don't have to do any of that, Heather, any of that. Oh, I don't mind. I know how hard it can be to keep up with your domestic duties on your work schedule, you know. We hired you to watch Chloe when we're not here. That's all. Okay? I'm sorry. I should go. Thank you, Heather. A little harsh, don't you think? MARK: So babe, check this out. I'm actually showing the house tomorrow. Young couple, first home, and if they like what they see, they might just make an offer. They talked for over three hours. What? What does an 18-year-old and a 5-year-old have to talk about for three hours straight? ( GASP ) I don't really know-- global politics. No, I'm serious. I don't know. That's why we hired her, though-- to keep her safe, entertained, and if she can do that just by talking, God bless her. If that's why we hired her, why does she clean the house and do our laundry? I don't know. Maybe if the laundry was done and the house was clean... Don't do that, don't. You're right. I'm sorry. It's just been, you know, the first time in awhile that we've actually had someone to help us out, and I think we should try to enjoy it. LINDA: You're right. Yeah, we deserve to...relax. Did you have fun with Heather yesterday? Uh-huh. What did you guys do? Did you talk about anything? No. We watched a movie. LINDA: What's wrong with the eggs? Heather makes me egg whites. Oh, since when do you eat egg whites? Since I found out they're better for you. LINDA: Okay. Egg whites it is. No, you don't have to. Heather will be here soon. She makes them better. So you two didn't talk about anything after we left? CHLOE: No, we watched a movie, did a puzzle, then I took a nap. Did you practice the violin? No. I'm not doing the violin anymore. Sweetie, you love the violin. You love the violin. I only liked it a little. I didn't know that. So what are you going to do for the talent show? Heather's teaching me a monologue-- that's a ( indistinct ) speech. Good morning, Mrs. Kessler. LINDA: Good morning. Can I ask what you and Chloe talked about yesterday? Talked about? Must have been interesting because you talked for over three hours? Did Chloe say we talked for three hours? We talked about Mrs. Highsmith. Chloe had a lot of questions about death after what happened, but she'll be fine. She's a tough girl, just like her mommy. What's this about a monologue. It's from Little Women . Yes, she's having a great time doing it, and she can't wait for you to see her perform. Well, Chloe will be performing the violin at the talent show. I'd appreciate it if you'd make sure she practices. Yes, ma'am. Have a nice day. Uh-uh. No. Don't be a perv. Don't be a perv. Uh-oh. I should have never recommended that thing. No, I'm, I'm... You're falling down the rabbit hole, aren't you? I think, I think she found the camera. So, you said Heather was a great sitter. Yeah, she's a great sitter and a great cook and a great maid and Mark and Chloe think she's so, so great. I see. ( SIGHS ) It's totally normal to feel a little jealous. Well, of course I'm jealous. I wish it was me that was spending more time with my little girl. And maybe you wish Mark was spending a little less time with the not-so-little girl. Okay. You're right. No more snooping. Good, because you have nothing to worry about. What do you have for me? Oh, just every Hooper ad from the last 50 years. All right. I'll study up. Ooh. So, I live right down the street with my family, so we're not just looking for a buyer, we're looking for a neighbor as well. Hm. It's close to the school which is good. Yeah, but it's still a little out of our price range. Oh, I love that window. What room is that? Um, that is actually not a room. No, it's purely decorative. You just don't see that kind of craftsmanship anymore. ( CHUCKLES ) Come on, let me show you inside. Sure. Honey, it's perfect! Here, come on in here. This is one of my uh, my uh, my most favorite rooms. Yeah, I'm still unfinished with some things, but mainly it's just cosmetic. I completed the copper plumbing last week and brand new wiring throughout the whole house. That's nice. Right, yeah, I like that stone. This fireplace is nice. I really like the high ceilings, too. Hm. Well, let me give you a better look at that. ( SCREAM ) Oh, wait you guys. Shit, oh! You guys, I don't know what happened, but I can fix it. I just need a little more time. MAN: You know, we're gonna, we're gonna keep looking. Thanks a lot. Yup. Yup. ( GROANS ) Oh my God! Oh, that's nice. ( GRUNTS ) See, they give away the brand too early. If we save it until the end, we keep them wondering what's this an ad for. Answer comes at the end of the journey with an ah-ha moment. Genius. Oh, sorry. Hey, babe. ( SIGHS ) I lost them. You lost who? That couple that was interested in buying the house. Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry. They probably just got cold feet. I just thought I fixed everything, but I guess not. Maybe I bit off more than I can chew. I just wanted to do something big, you know, to provide for us. See, that's the logo I like-- it's the old one. Works better than the new one. Sorry, babe. I'm in the middle of something right now. Yeah. But you're heading home now, right, to relieve Heather? Yes. LINDA: Great. And you know what, you'll be able to fix it. I know you will. Yeah, thanks... sweetheart. Coffee? Yeah, coffee. This is the one I like. ( GROANS ) HEATHER: Rough day? Hm. Rough day. Want to talk about it? I don't think you'd actually understand. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry. Oh, did you hurt yourself? Oh, not really, just a scratch. HEATHER: Oh, no, no, no. We've got to get you fixed up. You know, Heather, we actually hired you to take care of Chloe. You don't need to take care of me. Well, someone has to... and nurse Heather is here to the rescue. ( GIGGLES ) Ah, what is this? Chloe didn't finish her pain pills. Well, God bless her. Here, let me take a look at it. Ow! I had a rough day, too. Steven and I had a huge fight. What about? Share the wealth first. You're not old enough. I am in Europe. S'il vous plait, Monsieur Kessler? S'il vous plait? ( SIGHS ) Well, I mean, if I don't see it, technically it did not happen. Oh, whoa there, chief. That's... Merci. ...enough. De nada. ( WHISPERS ) De nada? All right, so tell me about it-- the fight with you and Steven. I want a family, and he's more interested in pursuing his career. It's hard when two people want different things, don't you think? Yeah. You know, but you're young-- plenty of time to figure it out. I'm not that young. Anyway, maybe I'm wrong. What if there's just something wrong with me? Listen to me, Heather, there is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting a family, all right? And there is nothing wrong with you. Really? Really. You really think so? MARK: Uh-hm. Yeah. Whoa. I think it's time that you go home. Okay? I know about the camera. It's okay, I'm not upset. I know that the two of you are just being extra careful. I just have one question. What's that? Do you ever watch me, Mark? You need to go the hell home, Heather. ( FOOTSTEPS ) ( SIGHS ) Just go home! ( RUNNING WATER ) Again, these aren't illegal to own,t but they are illegal to use. I understand. I need to hear what's going on in my house. So this babysitter-- sleeping with your husband? No, nothing like that. Swiped your jewelry? No, I'm just having-- I'm just having trouble with her right now. Yeah? Like what? ( SIGHS ) She cleaned my-- she turned my daughter off from the violin, so... Good luck. CHLOE: I like these. Good choice. Heather? Yes, sweetie. I'm scared. Oh, it's okay to be scared. Now remember what I told you. Bad feelings are energy, use them. That's right. Let me go check on your dad, okay? Okay. Okay. Hey, taking off? Hi. Yeah, it's-- Chloe's talent show is tonight and I, I've got to get there. So can you cover for me? Yeah, just don't let Reynolds see you. Linda, just the person I was looking for. Heard the Hooper people want to see a mock video presentation of your idea. It's a big step forward. Let's talk about what you're doing. I'd, I'd love to, but I actually can't right now. I've got to go. It's a bit early, isn't it? It's sort of a family emergency. Can we... can we talk tomorrow? First thing. Okay, thank you, sir. ( GROANS ) HEATHER: Need help? Um, no. I'm good. Thank you. HEATHER: I think you do. Has Linda called? No. ( CLEARS THROAT ) You really need to relax, Mark. ( SIGHS ) I mean, it's not like we did anything wrong. There's no crime in watching. It'll be our little secret. I don't know what you're talking about. Exactly. So handsome. I'll go start the car. Please, you have to help me. I'm sorry if I was speeding. I was try-trying to get to my daughter's school in time. I'm going to need to pop the trunk and step out of the car, ma'am. What? Why? Please step out of the car. It's clean back here. What's going on? Let's have a walk over here to the sidewalk. ( SIGHS ) Are you traveling with any children tonight? ( SIGHS ) No, I am going to my daughter's school right now and watch her talent show. Were you with any other children tonight? ( SIGHS ) I don't, I don't understand. We received a call that a woman in a car matching this description abducted a child. Abducted a child? POLICE: Yeah. Uh, this is a mistake. I'm coming from work. Can I just make a phone call? I'm afraid we can't let you do that-- not until we clear you from this claim. ( SIGHS ) ( GIGGLES ) You kicked Winona's butt, and that was... Yeah, you're just a natural, little woman. ( GIGGLES ) LINDA: Chloe, come here. I'm so sorry. I couldn't get there in time. I can't believe you missed it! HEATHER: I'll go check on her. Hang on, hang on. Little Women? I thought I told you that she was to play the violin tonight. It wasn't my decision, Mrs. Kessler. Right. Can I ask you a question, Heather? Sure. Did you go to Derry High? What are you doing? It's a simple question, Mark. ( SIGHS ) Yeah. I, I, I need to talk to your parents. HEATHER: No! The truth is-- I'm not from around here. I ran away from home six months ago. My parents-- they're not like you and Mark. They're horrible. I had to get out, start afresh. I thought I had, but if you want me to quit, then I will. Just leave my parents out of it. Heather, we're not going to call your parents. But why would you lie to us about this? I just wanted you both to think I was the perfect babysitter-- because that's what you are-- you're perfect. MARK: Linda and I, we're going to have to talk about this. So you just get yourself home safe, and we'll call you in the morning, all right? I'm so sorry. ( SIGHS ) Oh, wow! Missed your daughter's performance, take it out on the babysitter. LINDA: No, Mark. That's great. I got pulled over by the police. It was a misunderstanding. It wasn't my fault. It's never your fault. But at least Heather was there so she could support Chloe. Yeah. Okay, sweetie. It's time for bed. Come on. I wanted Heather to tuck me in. Come on. I don't know if Heather's coming back to us, okay? She lied to us, all of us. About how she's not from around here? How'd you know that? She's my best friend. We tell each other everything. What else has she told you? She was so sad before she found our family, and I want her to stay. Chloe... I love Heather, and I want her to stay! ( SIGHS ) Why is there no footage? Because I deleted it. I'm getting rid of the stupid camera tomorrow. What? It's not right, spying on people like this. Are you, are you defending her? So she's guilty of a little false advertising. Isn't that what you do at work every single day? How do you always make this about my work? I don't know. Why do you? Heather lied to us, Mark. She's scared, and she made a mistake. That is what teenagers do-- they make mistakes and then they lie about them. You should know. From what you've told me, you made plenty of mistakes at her age. This is not the same thing. No. Hiding an abortion from your parents is much worse. I can't, I can't believe you're throwing this in my face right now. Because that is what this is about, isn't it? It's about your insecurities about being a mother. You are so worried that Heather is better than you are. Heather is not a mother. No, but she's doing all the things a mother should do, including being there for Chloe, and you're just-- you're not. Because you never even wanted to be a mother in the first place. That's not true! Chloe was an accident. We never even talked about having another one. That's not what this is about, and I'm not buying your whole broken home sob story. I just want Heather out of the house. No. I'm not putting our daughter through the trauma of losing another sitter because of your paranoia. Chloe has already grown attached to Heather. I don't think she's the only one who's gotten attached. That's mature. Admit it, Mark. You have a thing for her. I do not have a thing for her. I bet you were real smooth when you picked her up. MARK: You mean, when I found us a babysitter while you were stalling? CHLOE: Mommy and Daddy were yelling again last night. That's happening more and more, huh? CHLOE: Yeah. Did your parents yell a lot? Uh-hm. What did they say? HEATHER: Look, Jake, don't do that. Please, Jake, don't. REYNOLDS: Linda. Mr. Reynolds. That sure doesn't look like work. Um, it's... You're clearly distracted and I don't want it affecting your work. It isn't. I, I promise. Because you know Gary's ready to take the helm on the Hooper account if your personal life's interfering with it. Mr. Reynolds, I assure you, my personal life is under control, and the client will not be disappointed at Tuesday's presentation. We can't afford to lose this account. Is that clear? Crystal. ( SIGHS ) Sorry, I tried to warn you, but he was too fast. I need you to find an address on this man, Jake Lambert. If you're really this suspicious, maybe you should just fire her. I can't fire her. She's got Mark and Chloe under her thumb, and if I fire her now, they'll never forgive me-- unless I can prove that she's still lying. Um, Linda, I don't know how comfortable I am with this. LINDA: Private investigators use it, you said. What is it again? Oh, think of it as the supermarket of databases. It's legal documents, genealogy archives, criminal records. And it's what, a couple hundred bucks or... A couple hundred a month. If you want to piggyback, it's going to cost you a Benjamin. That's no problem. All right. Here we go. Jake L-L... Lambert. Lambert. Uh, Jake and Gale Lambert, 56 and 52. Shows their last address as up in Florham. That's like, what, 60 miles away? Yeah, right. It's right up the 180. Thank you. Anytime. Hey, babe, it's me. Listen. I have to work late tonight, so don't wait for me for dinner. ( DOORBELL ) ( FOOTSTEPS ) Yes. Gale, Heather Lambert's mother? Have you found her? JAKE: Our Heather? Please tell us you have some news. Can I come in? Yes. Come in. Hello? HEATHER: One minute. Hi. For you. Uh, Linda's running late, so she asked me to put Chloe to bed and get dinner ready for both of you. She did, huh? Uh-hm. All right. So sit back and relax, and a romantic dinner will be ready by the time she's back. Okay. We've been so worried, haven't we, Gale? Uh-hm. I can imagine. You seem like really wonderful parents. Do you have a picture of Heather? Oh, of course. Right here. She was such a beautiful baby. The greatest gift we've ever been given. Hm. I don't, I don't think it's her. Are you sure? You have a lot of pictures of your daughter. Oh yes, photography is a real hobby of mine. With such a perfect subject you can never have too many. I always thought she'd grow up to be a wonderful actress. In fact I have some home movies if you'd like to see, just to be sure it's not my Heather you found. Oh, I, I feel silly. I'm certain it's not her. HEATHER: Mark, dinner's ready. Oh, yeah. Oh. Hm. Have a seat. What's going on here? And where's Linda? She's not here, as usual. But I am. I know you've had a long day at work, and nobody appreciates that more than I do. Hey, you know. Sorry, I think you have the wrong idea. Oh, I'm just full of ideas. ( BREAKING GLASS ) Oomph, clumsy. Hm. Um. Hm. HEATHER: We need to talk-- about whether or not we should tell Linda about us. Us? Hm... HEATHER: Yes, we're going to talk over dinner like civilized adults-- unless you'd rather I tell her about that night you watched my little performance. Let's talk, let's talk. HEATHER: Great. You look hungry, Mark. ( DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES ) Wait, Mrs. Kessler. You did find her, didn't you? It, it's okay. You keep her away from him. Don't bring her back here. Do you understand? Please, you need to protect her and take care of her. I never could. Gale? Mark, we need to talk about Heather. ( SIGHS ) First thing tomorrow. What do you want-- you want two or three?ree? Um, four. Four! ( GIGGLES ) Wow, I'll have to pack you a light lunch, huh? Hi. You slept in. Yeah, I don't feel that great. Can I talk to you for a sec? LINDA: I went to meet Heather's parents. And she wasn't lying-- I mean, the poor girl's been through hell. I feel bad for her, I do, but I still... I think we should fire her. You, you're okay with this now? Well, if she's as troubled as you say, I don't want her taking care of our daughter. What about work? Ah, my knee's been slowing me down. I'll take a week off, watch Chloe until we find someone we're comfortable with. ( DOOR OPENS ) What's everyone so happy about? I got this. Heather, sweetie. I tracked down your parents. Did you tell them? No. I told them I was mistaken, that I got the wrong girl. Why did you do that? Heather, did your father... I just wanted to find a new family... a better family. I'm so sorry if I ever crossed any lines. Well, you did... you did cross lines. You're letting me go, aren't you? I just think it's best for everyone. You shouldn't have to keep running. The cops need to know what happened with your father and... I understand. Thank you for your support. You really are some mother, Mrs. Kessler. ( MUMBLING ) Hey. Is everything okay? Everything's great. Good. Knock 'em dead! ( SIGHS ) Hooper means family. Hooper Family Foods. Through the years-- the '50s, the '60s, the 1970s and '80s. It's an Italian tradition at an American table.. Oh, there might be a glitch. I'm sorry. Ah, ah, ah, Off, now! Ah, ah. REYNOLDS: You start cleaning out your desk. ( WHISPERS ) Turn it off, turn it off! Ah, ah! It's okay. Why did you fire her? She was my best friend! Go to your room, Chloe. Quick note, she's crying. I hate you! ( BREATHLESS ) How could you do this to us? In our bed? ( DEEP BREATH ) I'm sorry. I don't even know what happened. I know what happened. I saw it in the video. What video? There wasn't-there's no video. She played us, Mark, from day one. And you fell for it! Why, why would she play us? She wants our family. She wants Chloe. Chloe! Chloe! Chloe! So you believe Heather also called in the child abduction. I don't know. Any idea why she would target your family and your daughter? Mr. Kessler, did you also find Heather's behavior suspicious? Every piece of information is crucial at this point. Heather and I, we had relations. Well, that complicates things. How long was this relationship going on? It wasn't a relationship. It was a mistake. All right. We'll talk about this later. In the meantime, we're looking everywhere. We checked with Heather's foster parents, but they haven't seen her in months. Foster parents? Yes, the uh, the Lamberts. They live in Florham. The Lamberts are her foster parents? Who are her real parents? She has no biological parents on file. Heather was a safe haven baby. A what? A newborn left outside a hospital by a parent who couldn't care for it. What hospital? INVESTIGATOR: St. Anthony's in Wakefield. Anyway, we're putting together search parties now and we're going to find your daughter. I want to help. INVESTIGATOR: We need all the eyes we can get, so if you want to drive around the neighborhood, that'll be great. All right. You know how to reach me. Don't hesitate to call. Let's go, officer. I know this is all my fault. I don't expect you to forgive me. It's not. It's not all your fault. It is though. This is all happening because of me, but I will fix it. I'm going to go out there and I'm going to find our daughter. ( CHLOE CRYING ) Sh-h-h-h! Don't cry. I'm here now. Why is Mommy being so mean? Oh, I don't know, honey. We have to get away from her really fast, okay? Okay. Come on. There's the camera. Say, "Hi Mommy." Hi Mommy. If you ever want to see your precious daughter again, you'll meet me at your husband's construction site. No police. No Mark, just you. LINDA: Chloe? ( LINDA ON VIDEO ): I can't believe you're lying to my face right now. MARK (ON VIDEO ): My God! That is what this is about, isn't it? Your own insecurities as a mother. You are so fucking worried... Chloe? MARK (ON VIDEO ): ...that Heather is better than you are. LINDA ( ON VIDEO ): She is not a mother. MARK (ON VIDEO ): Right, but she's doing all the things a mother should do, including being there for Chloe. Give her to me. How'd your big presentation go? Mark gave quite the performance, don't you think? Heather, you don't want to hurt her. They fight because of you, Chloe. You're a terrible burden on your poor mother. LINDA: Chloe, don't listen to her. Heather, I know why you're doing this. I've been so easy to forget all these years. It's about time you remembered me. How did you find me? Security tape from the hospital. Cameras don't lie. I'm sorry for what happened to you. Not for what happened-- for what you did. Chloe doesn't know. I wanted you to tell her yourself. No. Mommy left me in the cold, outside a hospital with nothing but that bear. Tell her what kind of a mother you really are. I don't know. What do you want me to... Tell her! Mommy, what is she talking about? Sweetie... when I was 18 years old, I had a baby, and I was scared. I was young. I just left that baby outside a hospital for someone else to take care of. Would you do that to me? No, I love you, sweetie. I'd never do that to you. Do you have any idea what it was like for me, Mommy? Living with that man, with what he did to me? That I dreamed every day of finding you. I waited until the day I turned 18, until I was free. That's when I would track you down. You would have missed me so much. You regretted what you did. The day I finally did find you, and I saw that you didn't miss me at all. You were happy without me. You and your perfect little family. So, so I started watching you, day in and day out, waiting for a way in. You can't take my family! Hm. Silly Mommy. I don't want to take your family. I want to destroy it. No, no! Look, look at this! What is that? It's the pendant I left with my daughter outside St. Anthony's Hospital. I didn't leave her with any teddy bear. No? And eight years ago when I tracked her down, she'd been wearing this when she died in a car accident with her foster mother. Her father gave it to me. ( SOBS ) No, no. LINDA: I'm sorry, Heather. It's the truth. ( SOBS ) You're lying to me. You were not the only safe haven baby that night. And you are not my daughter. ( SOBS ) You're lying. This is your blood. This is your blood. Your blood is my blood! ( YELLING ) ( SCREAM ) ( SOBS ) Hm. Are you going to kill her so we can be together? You, me, Chloe. We can be a family. Oh, Mark. It's so sweet how you think this is about you. ( GROANS ) Daddy! He was right. This is not a toy. Is Daddy all right? Now we both don't have daddies, you see? I hate you! You know, you just don't deserve a daughter. Say nightie-night, Chloe. ( GROANS ) ( GRUNTS ) I'm not your mommy, bitch! Chloe. Are you okay, sweetie? Is she gone? ( SIGHS ) Yeah. All right, sweetie. Time for Mommy to go to work. Okay. Want me to hold all calls? LINDA: Yes, please. Unless they're from my daughter. Yes, ma'am. Or your husband. Hi. Hi. Look at that piece of fantastic artwork. ( GIGGLES ) I'm going to need to proof these. Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry to bother you. It's just that he's so cute. What's his name? His name's Mark. I named him after his father.
