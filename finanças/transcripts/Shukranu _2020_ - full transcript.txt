'This the story of that dark phase of free India when emergency was declared in the country.' 'Emergency? Yes.' 'It is my story, but I am not the hero of this story.' 'Let me introduce you to the hero of this story.' Where are you taking me? -Come, just come. Don’t misbehave! -Tell me! Don’t misbehave! Come. -Tell me where are you taking me? Let me go! Hey! I know that you are a hero, but their baton doesn’t know that. It will beat you up and turn your ass red. This is your first day of promotion. You won't be able to even sit in that new chair. Let's go, hurry up. Where are you taking me? You look very happy. Come on, tell me. What is it? Why don’t you just tell me why are we here? You are just sitting and smiling. I'm just enjoying the biscuit. Try to understand. -Enjoying the biscuit! Enjoy! Enjoy the biscuit! Oh, I see. So, you are enjoying this biscuit, huh? No, I was just... I can see what… Hey! What hey? If you keep acting like Devdas, Thakur will whisk Paro away. Be a man. You don’t get a girl by chasing after her. You speak like you have a PhD on the topic. You hardly know me. Then enlighten me. My father had named me Inder for a reason. Greetings, father. Bhanu, I am someone who can even make a married woman stray. So unmarried girls are just… Harder. Yes? Why here? -Why? Yes, wrestler? No. Not a wrestler, Inder. My name is Inder. I don’t care what your name is. What are you doing here? I like wrestling. So, I thought I should learn it. One doesn't learn wrestling. You wrestle in the ground. Yes, right. So you go ahead and do it. I just came here today to watch. You have a great setup here. Done with the inspection? Now, you will learn. Come on. Make a move. Take my hand. Great. Hey, jump! Broke his ribs. That was amazing. Lift him up. Well done, my boy. Good going. There goes his spine Now swirl him around and throw him on the ground. Excellent. He's done for. The one who can even make married women stray Mr. Inder a.k.a. Bittu, we are men? -Yes, yes. We don’t follow girls. We don’t. Scoundrel, I am dying in pain here and you are trying to taunt me? Brother, the bungalow you went to, has been aptly labelled as the Romeos' Graveyard by Delhites. What? Akriti is a wrestler Bheeshm Lathwal's daughter. Her three brothers are also wrestlers. I have heard that they have sent many to an early grave. And the ones who survive, they make them bonded labour. Really? You are fortunate to come out of there, although a little broken. So, in future, if you ever wish to commit suicide… - Yes. You know where to go. I don’t want to go there. I don't want to. 'This is Aakashwani.' 'Home Minister K Brahmananda Reddy, while assuring that emergency could soon be over and said…’ How will I get married in this state? Bhanu… Would you like some tea? -Yes, I would. Then make two cups of tea. Add some ginger in it. How are you doing, brother Inder? Why want to know how he is doing, uncle? He is getting excellent massages. Yet he won't leave hope. -Why should I? Look over there. He is back. He is one determined lover boy. He came back even after being thrashed so badly. By the way girls, he's shinning even after the thrashing, isn't he? You will get me beaten up as well. Look confidently. Come on, let's check this Romeo's determination. Yes, let's go. - Yes. Are they coming this way? -They are coming here. Is it? I am getting worried now. Don’t worry. Keep it there. Stand up! Stand up! Stand up! Yes. Be confident. I will go ahead now. You too come along. Ok? One, two, three. -Come on. Bhanu! You are very stubborn. What? Come on, brother-in-law. Back to stare at girls even after getting thrashed? No... At least clear this out. Who do you come here to stare at? Her? Me? -Her? Her lover boy ran away with his tail between his legs. Oh, I see. Her. No use. She is Manglik. And also a child bride. But that doesn't concern you. You will still keep staring, won't you? Hey! What is happening here? No, I… Are you troubling them? What are you doing? Are you troubling them? We were just talking. -What were you talking about? You look like a decent boy. Yet you behave like a loafer. Don’t you have any shame? -Sir... Should I teach you a lesson? Don’t hurt him, Sardarji. Should I teach you a lesson? Let him go, Sardarji. -Sir. -Should I beat you up? It will teach you a lesson. Sardarji, he is a nice boy. Do nice boys behave like this? Look how he is behaving! Come on. -Useless. Let's go, brother. If she wanted to insult me, she should've called me alone. Have you done PhD in dramatics? Why enquire about the path you shouldn’t be venturing into? Bhanu, I wanted to take that path. That was the wrong path. There was a photo in yesterday's letter. Did you see it? What will I do by seeing the photo? I just got insulted because of one girl. I mean a little... Gave me no respect at all. Took me for a beggar. There... Do you see that moon? And that marigold flower? Marigold flower. Amazing. That moon is out of your reach. -Yes. But… That marigold flower is sure shot within your reach. -Yes. But... But if Mr. Inder keeps staring at the moon, then that marigold flower, someone will pluck and walk away. Do you understand? Marigold flower! Let me go! -Move! Let me go! Where are you taking me? Let me go! Wait a minute! What's going on, brother? Where are you taking him? -Let me go It doesn’t concern you. Leave. I should leave so that you can kidnap him? Back off! -You back off! Move! Let him go! Move! Let go! Let me go! Where are you taking me? Let me go! Look at that. They are kidnapping him right in front of everyone. Come I will write your report. No, sir. No report. They will take him away. I'll handle it. -What is my fault? Hey! -Yes, sir. Sir, this… where are you… what's going on here? Don’t worry. Come on. I don’t want to go with you. Come on. -Hey… Let me go! I am getting married. I have a train to catch in the evening. I am getting married. Let me go. Sir, I have a train to catch. 'Brothers, you all are requested to maintain peace.' 'Remember, vasectomy is beneficial to your family and your country.' 'One family, two children is the slogan of the nation.' I have a train to catch, sir. 'By deciding to get a vasectomy done, you will not only keep your family happy but will also improve the future of the country.' Come on. -Let's go. - No way! Make him lie down. Doctor! I am going to get married. Shut up. Hey, Sir,,, -I'll slap you. You don’t understand. -Sir… Sir, he is about to get married. If you are so worried about him then take his place. They will screw us if we don’t meet the target. Do you understand? Let me go! -Hold him tight. Sir, this is not… Hold him tight. Don’t let him go! No! No! "Rahim says, the thread of love between people is delicate," "Don’t allow it to snap" -Be careful.

No. Just… I am just a little nervous. Don’t be nervous. A happy married life is the mantra of life. One should stay away from alcohol and women. It's your family here, your wife will become your worst nightmare. I speak from experience. Looks like brother Bittu doesn’t like Reema. Think Reema, there is still time. If you marry me, you stay close to your parental home. Are you done? Leave. You aren’t being hanged. You are getting married. Smile a little. Yes. Brother Bittu! Come in, don’t feel shy. This is your room. And your wife too. I am just joking. Hey, hey, hey! What are you doing here? Sister-in-law, I am leaving tomorrow. So, I thought of enquiring after you. She is from our village, so this is my duty. So if you have done your duty and the enquiry then please leave. Yes. Munni! All of you leave as well. Reema. I mean sister-in-law... Please accept. I am leaving. So, brother. Best of luck! Okay, Bittu. Hey. Get up, it's late. Brother-in-law has been waiting to have tea with you. And you are still not done sleeping. Reema has made the tea today. Here. What is it? Is everything alright? Go and get ready. Go on. Reema, come here, please. I'll be right back. Yes, sister? Why is your bedsheet so clean? I didn’t do anything, sister. Why didn’t you? What happened last night? Nothing, sister. He came and went to sleep. He went to sleep? Why didn’t you wake him up if he was sleeping? If he didn’t initiate then you should have. You see, Bittu is a little shy. "A beautiful body… has many shades" Which shade would you like to see?" "My body… is on fire" "Which part would you like to see?" It's very hot in here. "My cheeks look pink" "You don’t know their true colour" "My cheeks look pink" "You don’t know their true colour" "My lips…" I was checking the cassette. What? No, it was very hot inside so I thought I should sleep on the terrace. Hear that! It's not snowing on the terrace. It's not so hot that you will melt. Go inside. No, I'll sleep on the terrace. Go inside. Why are you... Why are you… How can my son be like this? They had to change my bed on the next day of my wedding. Send both them to Khajuraho. Mind will get excited and the body will react too. But Khajuraho is too far away. His leave will be over by the time they reach there. Feed him drumsticks and he will be fine. Feed him crushed rhino horns. Not rhino horns, a tiger's penis. Give him crushed bee stinger. He'll get his on hop. If you permit, may I try something? People will recognise us. -Quite! Keep quite. This way. Here. Where are we going? Not me. Come on. We are almost there. Why have you brought me here, brother-in-law? To get you treated. But like this, stealthily, like a thief? Keep quiet. Look, the doctor is here. Hello. -Yes? We wanted to show you. Here? I think inside would be better. By the way, which one of you is the patient? Patient? There is no patient. He has a problem. Oh. And what is your problem? My problem? -Yes. I have no problem. I am absolutely fine. Then why do you wish to seek fun at his expense? You come inside with me. In my cabin. Brother-in-law, I think he too has a problem. Now that you are here, you should show him. You are wearing a cap and goggles. So your identity remains a secret. Go. What is the problem? Wet dreams? Premature ejaculation? Or watery semen? -No. I don’t have a problem. You don't have a problem? Then you came here for a stroll? Look mister, if don't tell how will I suggest a treatment? What treatment will you suggest? A rhino's horn? Or a tiger's penis? You want me to get stung by a bee? Or ask me to eat drumsticks? Or do you have any other great treatment like this? First tell me what the problem is. Doctor, the problem is that I got married a week ago. And the whole world knows, I am unable to do anything. And I am unable to do anything because I was forcibly sterilized. Do you have a treatment for that? He wants to treat me! I don’t have a treatment, but I do have a solution. Sit down. Tell me, how many days has it been since the vasectomy? Some... 10-12 days. You are sterilized, that doesn't make you impotent. No crops will grow, but you can still plough the land. Plough… It means you won't have any problem in keeping your wife happy. But you won't be able to procreate. Heed my advice. And think about procreating later. For the time being, think about your wife My wife. -Yes. This is for you. Oh! For the plough? It's perfume, mister. 'Apply some when you go close to your wife.' There are a lot of mosquitoes here Reema? Hey, Reema. What happened? Do you want something? No, just… not feeling sleepy. I can't sleep either. There are a lot of mosquitoes here. So, how did you like your new house? It is a very nice house. People in the house are also very nice. And what about me? I didn’t get a chance to know you. Yes... No… I was very tired. Were you tired or you don’t like me? Oh, no, no. It is not so. I thought you were a marigold but... you turned out to be a rose. No, I don’t want to force. -A mosquito. Huh? A mosquito. -Oh.

Hello. Government has ordered us to increase production. But the government is asking people to do vasectomy and stop the production. Hey, idiot! I am talking about our factory's production And not your reproduction. Right. -He is right. Tiwari's face looks like a monkey's ass. It was so red. Mr. Tiwari won't stop eating betel leaf so… Your father has sent a letter. Father or sister-in-law? No, you father. It's say Rajinder Singh. Greetings, father. God bless you. My dear son, Inder. I hope that everything is fine. I received good news from Mr. Jaidev yesterday. Oh! Reema… Reema is pregnant. With God's blessing you are going to be a father and I’m grandpa. That means I'm going to be an uncle. I am going to be an uncle! Uncle Bhanu! Uncle Bhanu! My friend! "Bless you, my son…" Why are you so shocked? You are going to be a father! My friend is going to be a father! Hey… What happened? Has he written something else as well? Inder! Vasectomy? You went through so much and you didn’t even tell me, Bittu? No… Sister-in-law looks quite decent in the photos. 'You still have time, marry me Reema.' [Wedding Mantras] Hey, where is Tiwari? He disappears every ten minutes. I am back. I am back. -Where were you? Where were you? My mind gets stuck if I don’t chew betel leaf. You don’t get paid to eat betel leaves here, Tiwari. Stop smiling and start working harder. Didn’t you understand? Mr. Inder! There is a trunk call for you. Hello? -Hello. This is Reema speaking. I am calling from your sister's place. How are you? Good. I am sure you must have received the good news. I am at my parental home. But your father wants me to give birth to the first heir in our house. Hello? Hello? It must be good news for you. What do you mean? You know what I mean. What are you saying? Are you feeling alright? I am hanging up now. Did you talk to him? What happened? Is everything alright? I think he doesn't want a child. It is not so. Do you remember how sad he was during the wedding? He is a little scared of responsibilities. That's all. Everything will be fine once he will hold the baby in his arms. Come on now, give me a smile. Otherwise, your child too will be born a cry-baby. I said, what do I need to do, brother? He said, nothing. I said, 200 rupees for doing nothing? Then do it. I said, go ahead. He took me inside a building. He took me inside a building and made me lie on a bed. As soon as he took a blade out, I lost my mind. I thought he is taking my manhood away in exchange of 200 rupees! They at least tried to lure you with money. At my place they are taking the entire village for it at gunpoint. Teenagers, young and old. They aren't sparing anyone. What can you do? Chaudhary of my village wouldn’t stop even after having a dozen children. A dozen? -Yes. He would walk like this, with pride. One day police came to take him away. And all his manliness just disappeared. He was begging them to let him go. "Sir, I have a second wife who is young." 'They just took him and got his vasectomy done.' Mr. Inder, do you want to break Kumbhkarana's record for sleeping? Huh? Wake up! Otherwise that demon Chandil will make Tiwari take your place. Get up! I will break your fast. Get up. Hurry up. Alcohol with soda. Have it. Look, Inder. Your wife did what she had to. What can you and I do under the circumstances? If you try to expose sister-in-law, you are the one who will get exposed. No, you can do that if you want to Otherwise, move on with your life. Don’t mourn thinking that you are helpless. I mean, for someone's mistake don't ruin your life, bro. Drink. Go ahead and drink it. No. Why? Get some ice. I cannot like this… You are royal. I'll get it. Don’t think too hard, man. There's still greenery all around. All you need to do is step out. Inder! Inder! Came back from your village? Remember us? We are Aakriti's brothers. We had taught you how to wrestle? Did you recognise us? Aakriti has been waiting over there for you since so long. But you went missing. Where did you disappear? Come along, father wants to meet you. Come on. Father, it’s him. Do you want to be a tiger or a goat? He looks like a goat. Tell me, my boy. What do you want to be? I'll be whatever you want me to be. Father, let's turn him into a peacock, huh? Fine, then be a goat. What are you all doing here? Go and wrestle. What is your name? G... Inder. And G stands for what? Goat, gangster or geek? G for God. You are God? No. Just letting you know another word starting with G. So, now you want to teach me English? Father, let's test how good he is in English. And who will do that? Father, Gobar will. Yes, father. Hey Gobar, come here. Listen… It's Gover-dhan. Ya… whatever. You wealth-less dung… You study in college? So today, we will test you. Say whatever knowledge you have in English. Ask such a tough question that he goes mute. Go on. What is your name? Scoundrel, even I know that! Ask something tough. What is the capital of Union of Soviet Socialist Republics? Moscow. Huh?

While I was studying for graduation a got a job. Aren't you graduate? No. What do you do? I am Chief Supervisor in Sri Ram Mill. Hey, Maruti. Yes, father. Take him in. But father... No, you have it.

Earlier I used to always play as tiger but now I am just a goat. See, the other day, my friends only trying to pamper our romance. How was I to know that Sardarji would come and spoil everything. So to speak, neither am I a Manglik nor the Balika Badhu (Child Bride] See, please forgive me for whatever happened that day. Oh, no... what are you doing.? You shouldn't. All right. So everything is fine then? "Dear, what do I say, dear" "Entire world seems to be lovely" "Just look at this beautiful world from my eyes" "See how the land smiles with me' "I sore beyond the skies" "The world is nowhere around me" "Live it up my heart, you too smile" "Live it up my heart, you too smile" "Live it up my heart, you too smile" "Live it up my heart, you too hum" "Finding and losing, yeah" "Smiling and crying, yeah" "It was very much within me, yeah" "My very existence, yeah" "Sinc3 when I have understood the philosophy" "I am living in happiness" "My partner is, my moon" "Like I am glittering here" Sis, Lassi No, thanks.

Brother Inder, shall we go too? What happened? Is Reema Bhanu's wife of yours? Me? What do you mean? To keep he her head, it is your shoulder. She can only see the residual of Lassi on your face. And now it's you to clear her eyes? This Bhanu is impotent, not blind. Is he? Bhanu is impotent? In the guise of lady Sita he is evil Menka. I don't trust him at all. See, you are leaving that house today itself. Arre, how can I just leave that house? No, I can. But Akriti, they will really mind it. He is my childhood friend, so... All right. Then I will speak myself. Hey, where are you going? Akriti is cross with me. So Bittu is pacifying him. She so naive. Why did you she call you "Brother"? -Did she? Actually... Sis, girls in Delhi call anyone as brother. And then I am from Bihar. Why is Akriti angry with you? -Angry... Wrestling. Her father wants me to be a wrestler. I refused. Now you tell me. If I indulge in wrestling, what if my bones crack? Why wrestling? -Everybody in her home is wrestler. Even the son-in-law they want is wrestler. What are you discussing? -About the bone fracture... Shall we? Come let's go home. Akriti told me. You are sleeping in a small room with your friend and his wife. As long as you don't find a room, continue staying there. Yeah. Oh, no. Actually Bhanu will really feel it bad. And there is small problem of sleeping, that I will... Uh, I will sleep in the kitchen. You think about your friend too? Good. Escort him in. Show him the room. Go. What? Come on, go. Come in, this is your room. Will you sleep in this dress? Look, this is my closet. Whatever you need take it. Okay? Good night. Open. What? The door. It's late at night. Go and sleep. Sleep? Brother. Let's go, man. Listen. You have just returned from night shift. Again going back to work? This way you will fall sick. Yes, but I have to do the job. -But will have to rest too. Sir, his wife has just come from the village, so... So? Also spare some time for love to sleep. So that you don't feel sleepy in the office in the morning. My wife also goes to her place. And come back too. But... Yeah? The factory people make you work a lot. You... Don't be so worried about the baby. Once it come, it will bring all the happiness in our lives. I have also thought that... -What's this child, child, child! What do you think? Can't there be anything else in a man'a life apart from your child? Just.... You are tired. Take rest. Who is he, brother? -Brother. Whose brother? He is watchman at the factory, so affectionately I call him brother. But he appears to be a wrestler. That's why he the watchmen. I will be back. You said you won't go today? Can't you see he came to call me. How come he just came to call you. They are made you work day night for two days. You aren't some machine. If you can't, I will speak to that watchman. What... hey... Who's watchman... No, I will speak to him. I will speak to him this evening. Here you go Hey, listen... uh... I was saying, you too sleep here tonight. I am afraid of sleeping alone... I can't sleep. I couldn't sleep at all last night. Come on, we will have a pillow between us. Oh, God! Come. Thief! Thief! Get up, man. Thief is here. Open the door quickly. What? -That thief... What are you doing here? Get our of here. Nobody is there. I looked. Must be some cat or something. What cat of anything? I personally saw the thief. I saw. Nobody is there. See for yourself. Ram Maruti! Ram Maruti, come out! What happened? -There was a thief in the house. A thief in this house? -What else. How dare he! -Arre, you come.. - Brother Mangal! I saw somebody outside from inside the house. Arre... Are you mad? Ok, then find what you want to. What happened? What are you up to? Brother, there was thief in the house. Thief? But the doors are closed. Must have come from roof. Yes. And must have gone the same way. But, when did you come? Just now. I am going. Who else are there in your house? Great grandfather, grandfather, two uncles, elder uncle's two sons, three daughters and their elder son's one son... Not the mouth, move your hands, idiot! So, boy. Who are there? My father and granny. Have an elder sister who is married. Write a letter to your family. On the 18th of this month everyone has to come. It's engagement. What? Yes. She is my only daughter. I don't care for the world, so I have given her complete freedom. But now it's time to bind her in bond. Yes. You left the motorcycle there itself? Where your concentration? Her father has said, engagement is close, have to do some shopping Be prepared. Who was he? Is he also from your factory? Hmm. Had come to return your mobike from the factory? Why? Can't he come? Of course he can. Where is your watch? Forgot at the factory? For day shift you go to factory this way and at night you return the other way. How? Look, Reema. As it is I am so upset. There is no need to talk nonsense. Nonsense? I am speaking nonsense. Ok. How many brother Akriti has, brother? How many? Three. And what direction her house is? And is Akriti your fiend? Are you having an affair with her? What drama is this? Brother. Yes. I swear by our child. I have to talk to you. You have to talk? -Yes. All right, I too have to talk, Come let's talk today. What are you doing Bittu? Are you mad? -Look, brother. As much you could take his side to fool me, I have been fooled enough. Now you leave and don't interfere between us. You knew Akriti before our wedding? That's why you were sitting glum in the wedding. And that bull? Whose engagement he was talking about? -I don't know. Don't know? You such a disgusting man that I can't even swear you on our child. Your entrapped in that Akriti's tarp so deeply, that forget, me you don't even have any attachment to the child? I have no attachment. Neither with you nor that child, because the baby is not mine. I wasn't sitting glum during the wedding due to Akriti. I was glum because... Because I was sterilized. And when I was sterilized, how could that child be mine. You are your paramour's child on me and you are saying I am... Am I a disgusting man? What happened, Inder? Oh, sit. Sit. What happened? I can't go through this engagement. Have you gone mad, boy! Hey, Mahavir. Sit down. Sit. I am sterilized. What? I have undergone vasectomy. Oh, he has been sterilized! So what if you are sterilized? If a sterilization can take place it can be reversed too. Don't you worry, boy. I am here. If this is your problem I will solve it right away. Hey, Mangal. Bring the car. Come on get up, boy. Come. Come. What happened? We are taking him to doctor. He has been sterilized. Sterilization? But he is perfectly all right. I mean, he appears totally normal. Come on move now. Come on. Come. What happened? His sterilization is to be reversed. What? He has been sterilized, it is to be reversed. Have you lost it? Mr. Latwal is here. So, Doctor. Have you heard? Now get to work. You see, this operation is very difficult. It will take just ten minutes. You tell me how much will you charge? See, it is not the money. The procedure is complicated. I can't do it. Look, Doctor. Do you see that boy? He is to be my son-in-law. Now either you open his vein or else, in your clinic, we will shut your veins. Come in. Come. Come. Bring the boy. -Come, bro. Good news. I opened it. I did nothing. Vein was already open. What? What nonsense is this? Because he was not sterilized at all. Damn liar! Were you trying to fool us! You ****! -Hey, stop, stop. He is not lying. He is telling truth. He was sterilized but it was not done properly. Each doctor preforms 100 operations a day. So... One or two mistakes are made. Oh, so it was a nice mistake. Hey, Doctor. You saved my daughter's wedding. Say, how do I pay you? You just give me fifty rupees. But I have a request. If anybody asks you what are you doing here so late at night, tell them that all of you had come here for sterilization. So you are back? Come in. What happened? What happened? Is everything all right? Not now. We will talk in the morning. Where is Inder? Call him. Here he is. You have really glorified family name? The one who doesn't bother about his child, how will he bother about his family? Father, it's not like that. I am aware that this child is indeed mine. Yeah. We too know that. You see, how do I tell you, I have... I have realized my mistake. I accept my mistake. We will account tor your right or wrong later, first we will take care of these wrestlers. Where is there home? Sir. You... His friend must know that. Come, Mr. Laxman, show us the Lanka. Come on. -Come on, don't just watch. Come. Arre... Father... Granny! Come please. Be careful. Yeah. -Hey, massage properly. Come on, tighten your hand! Come on, practice properly. He is more prepared than us. So what? We are from Raghuvani clan. We don't fear no one. What are you watching in them? Hey, keep quite. When you see your own, don't fight. And when you see sturdy man, don't be afraid. Got that? Yes, who are you? I am Inder's father. Uh, hello, sir. Please come. Hey, father! Inder's father and others are here. Good that you came. I too felt that... It is not good to finalize engagement date alone. But your son didn't inform that you are coming. Inder also didn't inform us many things. Your son is really promising. Yes, that's why you've trapped him. What? It's not sweet enough. Can I get some sugar? Are you attending a wedding? Keep the glass over there. Come here, come. Come. She is my daughter. Akriti. And dear, he is Inder's father. Okay, okay. Has Inder fallen for this wretch? Hey, old women! What nonsense are you talking? Who you called old woman? You son of a bull! Who did you call a bull? He is the bull! And he is the bull's son. You, witch! Just putting wrapping your head with shawl, trying to act decent! Oh, sir don't hit me! Hey, Mangal let it be. I haven't taken leave from the factory. My money will be deducted. Do you think if you are wrestler you will do anything? Oh, don't! I am trying to recall.... You called me old woman? Calling me old lady! Father...! Granny, granny... -What? Hey, granny, it's me. Inder. You are trying to lure my brother! My brother? She does it. Yeah, but she is his wife and you are outsider. We are losing and you are bothered about pay cut? What? You too lost it? Damn you! -She is Bittu's wife. Yeah, you were having fun with Inder since so long and you don't know that his name is Bittu? If I had known that Inder's family are such a brutes... I would have never even thought of this relationship. Father, Inder is married. -Get away, girl. Inder is already married! Such a deception? Actually we have been deceived too. Hid his marriage from her. And there, to get rid of his wife and children, he narrated a fake story of sterilization! He was having fun on the pretext of sterilization and rascal was saying that I am having affair with Reema! This man is factory of deception. I didn't want to deceive anyone. Instead the baggiest deception was with me. Just two days before the wedding, I was forced to undergo sterilization. I couldn't even tell anyone about it. Then everything was going fine with Reema. Suddenly this child popped up between us and I... If I am sterilized, how can the child be Mine? I was going mad thinking of it. During the same time Akriti came in my life. I felt, if... If Reema is happy in her life after deceiving me, I too have every right to be happy in my life. And I realized my mistake when doctor the told me that my sterilization wasn't done properly. And before I could do anything you guys came here and raised hell. I did make a mistake. Hiding the truth. But had I not hidden the truth what else I could do? Should have heard people's taunts? Should have become a laughing stock? Yes, I am the culprit. But what about those who forcefully destroyed the lives of millions in one stroke? Who will account for that? Who will take its account? Reema! Reema! -Reema! Hey... Reema... -Listen. Dear Reema, what happened? Take her to hospital. Bring the car out. What are you doing here? I still have to settle account with Inder. We will take care of Inder later. Not now. Akriti... Akriti. Whatever I did was... The child... It has come! Congratulations. Congratulations to you too. Congratulations. You have a daughter. Both mother and child are fine. Thank God. Hey. You wait. 'Didn't I tell you that this story of mine... out of 250 million sperms in race I am the only one who is winner.' 'By which this girl child is born.' Let's go, Akriti. Akriti. Akriti... The mistake I made.... Father... It appears our hero has fallen in a new jumble. Now what to do? That time itself was full of jumble. During the entire duration of Emergency, about a million people were sterilized. About 2500 people died due to carelessness during operation. Thank God, our hero was not one of them. End djs@#
