Let me, Juraj Jakubisko, a Slovak film director, tell you about those who wanted to be righteous. Also, about how necessary and vain it is to seek rescue from life without love for hate, where happiness comes with sorrow, and death is something ordinary. This story has a tragic ending. But laugh if you feel like it, our heroes also do so right to the very end. The world is nice but it's not all nice, unhappy but not really unhappy, crazy and full of love and vice versa, everything changes, there's no end without a start. The Slovak Film Institute presents a Juraj Jakubisko Film BIRDIES, ORPHANS, AND FOOLS Starring: Come here. Which one do you want? Featuring: We'll leave those for Andrew. - Taking pictures? - Like a maniac. Wait! Let me be! Story and screenplay by: Andrew! Producer: Made in co-production with: - I swear: no more women! - Yeah, right... - Are you bored, pal? - What do you care? Just as I thought. - Come on, let's go for a drink. - I don't feel like it. - What about dancing? - I don't have the clothes. - It's yours. Keep it. - You mean it? L'm getting married tomorrow. Flowers! Come here. Are you a girl? Makes no difference... He's a bridegroom, you know? Pretty boys are in the world and l'm lost. Hey, you! Get Up! - Morning! - What is it? - L'm protecting you. - OK, whatever... - Don't cry, kid! - l'm scared. It's just little birdies, don't be scared. How come you're here? I rescued you! You're a girl... I must have drunk a lot. When you go to sleep, cover your eyes, so they won't peck them. They're not bad. Look. Like this. Yorick! Where are you? Wake up. Andrew's waiting for you! What happened here last night? There are lots of strange things in the world... She did it... she was scared of the birds. Who's this? I don't know her name. You can lie down with her if you like. - Was she scared of the birds? - She was catching them all night. Don't be scared, they're just watching. They'll give us a sign one day. Birdies... Life is beautiful! Do you see him? L've got an appetite, muscles, and a headache. Somebody must have hit me. You said you'd rescued me. Why? - Because l'm fair. - Look! Those aren't birds but the souls of the dead. Why's your hair been cut off? - I had lice. - Lice? - Lice. - The nits. Ilike you. Dear Milan, dear general, your propeller broke, your wings broke, and you crashed... Roza, young Stefénik, and... What about a drink? She'll read your palm. Come to the woods, won't you? Watch out! We're grown-ups. You must know the gypsy girls. There they are! They're waiting for us. They don't mind getting laid. But having their picture taken is shameful. - Look how happy they are. - Sure, they are. Aren't they beautiful... They need heroes. Watch the camera! Heroes? They're cowards. - What's the matter? - Nothing. As if you've stopped liking the world. Stop! Look at that house! Happiness is a white house. You'll get tired of the world too once you come home. - I got into a fight with a girl yesterday. - Again? I couldn't get her out of the wardrobe. I told her to go, that you'd beat me. Look what she did. lt's real. Wake up! What's up with you? - She's ill. You need some heat. - Sure. And where's the wood? Give me some money. They paid you for the photographs. Send her away first. You won't let me work, will you? After you make her leave. Don't come in! Let me be! I don't like it when l'm dirty. Leave me alone! - L'll wash your back. - Go away! You're pretty. There's one thing I don't like about you. You should have your hair cut. Behold... Lazarus. Blue and cold... holy as death itself... the sea like death... It will forget... What don't you like about her? She's so stunningly dirty. She's disgusting! You'll make her go as soon as she gets well again. She's not even a woman. I got used to your women, but this one... I hate these people! She's Jewish. Jewish! Filthy! Gross! - But all Jewish girls are beautiful. - Especially this one! - Go to hell! - She looks like death, I hate her! If you don't understand beauty, you can't understand ugliness. Photographer! Artist! Intellectual! You see, you shouldn't get angry. Touch me. Make me dirty! The sea will wash me clean. L'm christening you Sibyl. - L'm Martha. - Is that a Jewish name? You talked about death when you were ill. Don't move! All rivers flow into the sea but the sea will never overflow. And they return to where they flow. Only to start flowing again. God gave the world a lot of love, and there's still not enough for all. So I won't break up the friendship and I won't think about sex. Martha, where are you? And you, Andrew? - Did you wash your feet? - I did. Say your prayers and off to bed. The world is a lovely place, if there is joy. - We wake up happy... - and enjoy life. Look. She's asleep. What is it? - We want to see you naked. - Say that again! - We want to see you naked. - Only if you take your clothes off too. - Come on! - l'm not doing this! - Help! - You first. Done! Seel? No! - Who's that? - He's a fool. - And that one? - He's a sage. Eat, it contains phosphorus, we'll see you at night. It stinks! I don't want to, leave me alone. Be quiet. Man grows old and his heart aches. He loses his father, and his mother, and becomes an orphan. And God says: l'll be yourfather and mother, He vanishes in smoke and abandons the man. God dies and the orphan in body becomes an orphan in soul. L'm calling in vain, all I hear is the bell tolling for the dead. It tolls for God, for father, and for mother. Man grows old and his heart aches. And I didn't learn to play the piano. This man made a mistake. Come on, dear landlord. Shouldn't we burn old people? They're full of snot, sweat, and slobber. They stink of urine from a distance . Who burns with truth and righteousness Who offers life in sacrifice Who sheds a tear for injustice To him my song with glory rings! - How was the cremation? - Just about right. Life is beautiful! What do I need gloves for? Partisans, Germans, come out, you won't come to any harm! - The war ended twenty years ago! - What? How many years did you say? - It's been twenty years now! - Have you gone mad? No way! I don't believe you. Fascists... They are everywhere... - Do you know who Stefénik was? - A soldier, a general. Was he born here? He died here. When he was flying over here, bad people shot him down. - Did he have an aeroplane? - We used to be a rich family. - Was he your father? - You don't believe me? I never saw him. - All he left me is the statue and the foolishness. - What about your mother? She was killed by those who are said to be... reasonable. But it was long ago, wasn't it? My parents were killed in Poland by fools. Mine were killed by Jews. Jews, you understand?! Our parents killed each other and we are orphans. No need to cover your eyes any more. It'll help you catch the birdies. - To my health, Andrew. - I can't. - Drink, you hashish! - Let go! Don't... I put some sedatives in the wine. I want you, Martha. - You are beautiful. - You are beautiful. I wanna be with you... always with you... forever... He's sleeping like a child. Sometimes you hurt him. I feel sorry for him. He hasn't had a girl yet. Friendship is nice. Why are you telling me that? - You should go to bed with him. - You wouldn't mind? I care for Andrew. - Why did you say you loved me? - I love you. Love shouldn't be selfish. Shame can't be washed from my name, Strangers smeared my face, Like an artist's hand covered with paint. Have mercy, let me be different! - Happiness is a white house. - It is a railwayman and two white goats. - Happiness is... - I like Martha. Happiness is... A railwayman sleeping in the grass. - Tell her to sleep with me. - Why so suddenly? She's Jewish, don't forget. And you're a virgin. It suits you. I know. - My Yorick, where are your gambols? - Is she talking to me? There's none of them left... - What's wrong with her? - She's not talking to me. Since there's a lot of pain, God chooses from the tribe of Levi 33 righteous ones from each generation to laugh and to do harm. She's right. There's a lack ofjustice. But people like us need to be in this world too so that you have something to laugh about. I almost killed a guy like him. I know what you think. When you're crazy and praise yourself, and when your thoughts are evil, cover your mouth and be quiet. All that follows the law of changes, and the law of power, everything beside yourself is vanity. So return into yourself. When others destroy your house, start to build it again, but in your soul. Build a house inside, live in it, and you'll find happiness. WORDS ARE THE WEAPON OF THE POWERLESS They'll call you a fool. Don't you care, as long as you're fine. And you are fine, because you are free. You are free, because you're a fool. See you in hell! Good morning. - What happened to you? - When I jump, my head starts aching. - What is Yorick really like? - He's good... Was Stefénik really his father? Why are you laughing? - Stefénik died fifty years ago. - So what's his name? - Yorick. You know nothing about him? He seems so insensitive. Don'tjudge him. It makes him sad. He cares for you. - Why don't you like him? - Don't say that. That isn't true. Why do you hate my birdies? You set traps for them. You lure them with bacon and seeds. And they won't even touch it. And still they live. Who nourishes them? God? Don't move! Lie down! My sweet little angel. Here's some candy. I wanted to cry the first time I saw them. These kids are never going to grow. Come here! - Do you see him? - Where? It is the oldest home in Europe. We only wanted to see this window. Maria Teresia used to sleep in this bed. Take a picture of the young lady. Take a picture of the young lady! Don't be shy, Andrew! Come on! - Yorick put you up to this. - No. You're doing this just to please him. L'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you. You're a good man. You were right. The world is dirty, filthy, and cruel. I take pictures with my eyes, I capture everything that is evil. The more I absorb, the less evil will be left in the world once I leave and take it with me. Some get drunk with water, I get drunk with ugliness. What are you doing here? Look what you've done, idiot! You've let the light onto my prints. You should've opened the door. How was it? What? Nothing happened. - You can tell me. - Ask her. - You know l'm a fool. - You two were made for each other. You both make things up. You torment each other. You take pictures with your eyes. And you think that l'm a fool. You'd starve if it wasn't for me. I want to show you something. She's not scared of them anymore. She's putting them in a pan. - What're you doing?! - l'm burning them. What've they done to you? Here they are! Who is it? Martha... What? Are you putting on a show? Why are you with him all day? You don't even talk to me. And at night you act as though nothing's going on and sleep with me. - Are you jealous? - Don't laugh at me! I want you to like me. L'm learning to be cheerful. I know one thing. You love me. - No, I don't. - Yes, you do. No. I won't lie to myself. Better to kill myself... My parents and brother didn't die. They perished like sick animals. And the others... You understand... What do you want? To make love? Why do you humiliate me? Leave us alone! Go away! We'll be fine, Andrew and I. Go and take photographs. Hold me, Yorick. I love you. Don't make me go. Maybe Jews really are gross. What did you say? Yes, disgusting! L'll kill you! Here you are! Go! Martha! Where are you? Come out! Stop looking for her, I let her go. How come one has a small tail and the other has a big one? It's the same with all muscles: when you work it, it grows. My dad has a tail like a dog too. - What does he do with it? - He moves it. For your dead daddy, for your dead mummy, for your dead godmother, for uncle Stefénik, and for Mao's red star, O.K.? Life is beautiful. You were touching me in the night and petting me again. - You'd better talk... - About God, will you? God doesn't love me anymore. Don't be sad. What's the use of playing the piano. You got to know the two of us! You didn't waste your life at all. We are happy- We are happy- Man touches nice things, he smells grass and hay, his skin smells like the sun, birds are flying around. Man is surrounded by good people, his soul is at peace. When you're playing the piano you look straight ahead and you see the dust in the air. It rises and floats in the air and slowly settles again. Yorick wants to talk to you. - I can't, they're waiting for me. - There he goes. - They can wait. - lt's a waste of time. Look! Good morning. I brought you something to eat. Wake up! Good morning, auntie. How shall we pay you back? That was nice. Give me one more! What shall we give you? Do you want the engine? Everything you see is yours. What shall I do with the light? Hold it! Stop! Wait! L'll take a picture of you! Get down on your knees. Cross yourself. Fire! I like you... I love you... - l'm happy you're here. - Me too. - Do you love him now? - Yes. Look at him! Watch out! The new wave! Come back to us. Whatever you hold close in your life, it turns into its opposite. Only madness is a guarantee that you won't be unhappy. Change! The wheels are still turning, death is far away, and it's snowing. Before a snowflake reaches the ground, it stops snowing. L've always been on the run. Fleeing from the whole world. But I was fleeing from myself. I know you knew it. We can't master life... We can't master love... so let's enjoy it in the meantime. At least the moments as they go by. At least a little bit of happiness... - Then the sea will come. - Yes, the sea. You're giving up too soon. I can now. You mean so much to me. - I can die now. - Me too. - If you love me... - I love you! - What's up? Why are we stopping? - I don't know. - What's happened? - We've run out of petrol. - What shall we do? - Somebody will give us some. Wait! lt's the police! Run! L'll plead guilty. What's this? Put it away! What do you think you're doing? He's a fool! L'm with you, bear with me! L'll stay with you too. Do you hear me? Now I know. Only love is necessary. One has to love everybody! Even those who do evil things. God gave us the gift of love to purify those who hate, those madmen who build prisons, who kill the defenceless. There will be no more victories and no defeats! Do you hear me? Too bad it's just a liar talking who happens to be shitting. See you in a year. Welcome! - Look, it's a surprise! - Your new coat. Nice to see you Mr. Yorick! We missed you. L'll show you a miracle. A miracle! The fingers fly all by themselves! All by themselves! Do you like it here? They've started publishing my works. - Guess how much I got for that. - I don't know. L'll start photographing too. Do you mind sleeping under the tree? You'll sleep well here, you'll see. Don't move! Don't you take pictures with your eyes anymore? Why are you so sad? They gave me time to think. And suddenly I felt empty inside. You've put some weight on. Are you happy? Take it. l've got a new one. I know what's missing! The little birdies! What did you do? You fools! No need to cover your eyes anymore. Mind the glasses! Why are you laughing? Would you like a snack? Thinking is useless. lt's better to be a fool, you were right. I was? It's your idea! Take the knife out... smile... A natural smile, like in real life. Once more. Cut the bread. Look here! What happened to you? Foolish or not, all's in vain. Does he kick? - What shall we call him? - Yorick? Want to see something real nice? Promise not to laugh. I didn't know you had children. Do you like them? He'll take your picture. What have you got? A clown? Aren't they beautiful? - What is it? - l've come to see you. Watch out for the ice! I thought you lived with Andrew. - It's nice here, isn't it? - Really nice. - Will he marry you? - Maybe. And you'll let me live there? It is much warmer here for the baby. It might get ill. - Or even die... - Don't say that. Here, it might fall. It would die - and the happiness'd be over. Why are you so quiet? Are you offended? Do you love Andrew? You forgot about me. Who's here with you? She's making a fool of me. You scare me. I don't want you to be jealous of Andrew. You look younger than before. That one year did wonders. Do you like me? - You lost your courage. - Courage to do what? - Courage for foolery. - What's foolery? To have courage, you need faith. Do you have faith? L'm sorry for everything. Children are beautiful. Yes, my Yorick. We used to love each other. - I trusted you both. - That's right. - I can't... not with you... - Smile. - You can't even smile anymore. - Can you? Does it hurt? So why do you laugh? - I love you. - I love you too. More than anything else in the world. But less than my own life. That's good. No! I love you, but I don't want to die. Don't do it... I don't want to die! Don't be afraid, my little bird. How long your hair's grown. Why did you do that? Do you hear me? Are you sleeping? Martha! Open the door! I can see you! Oh God, why is the world so sad? Why is sadness the only beauty that lasts? Oh God! English subtitles edited by: D. Shearman
