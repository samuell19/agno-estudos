Men seem to stare at my breasts all the time. - Does that bother you? - Oh no, I like it. Do you think the sultan would like to play with them? - Well, they, uh, they are tempting. - Oh, well, you know, he could get in between 'em and bounce 'em around. And uh, he could tie them up. Some men like to do that, you know? - Really? - Mine look really good when they're tied up. But do you know the best thing? - Do tell. - The best thing is when you sit on me, get in between them, and fuck them. - In between them, you say? - If you had somebody here, I could show you. - Darn. The boys that help just went to lunch. - Oh, well, you could do it, Your Honor, if it wasn't a bother. - Well. I suppose someone must, for the sultan. - The sultan is blessed to have someone like you. - I know. A patriot. - Well, of course. - A hero. - Yes. - An example. - Lay down. Oh. There were preliminaries and eliminations and round robins, and eventually, three finalists were chosen. The sultan himself was to be the final judge. Lady Viviane had bribed her way into the finals. She was rich and could show the sultan the true meaning of decadence. - I've arranged a party. - Do I have to dress? - No, it's a small get-together. You'll like it. Mm. - Who's coming? Lady Viv was a swinger. She gave the best parties in town. Everyone who was anyone came and came and came. Lick my nipples She's doin a good job on ya huh? She's sucking your pussy good enough? Huh?

Grab my hips while I come, yes make me come I want you to come all over my ass At dawn, Lady Viviane invited everyone back to her house to continue the party. The sultan was exhausted. He looked out over his city and thought. - There must be more to life than this. But what? Power. The second finalist was named Elita. She came from a military family. - I know what you need. The sultan was bound by the rules. He had to give each finalist a fair chance. - Training. You need to learn how to be my slave. - I'll try. - You do want to learn, don't you? - Yes. - First lesson.

To match her beauty, Scheherazade possessed the most exotic talent of all the contestants. It was a special gift. Scheherazade had the gift of imagination. - My lord sultan, would you permit me to show you a family treasure? - But of course. Where is it? - Here. - It's just a mirror. - But a very special mirror, my lord. You see, it was a gift to my grandfather who was a sailor. - What was his name? - Sinbad. - Never heard of him. - Oh, but you will, my lord. You see, this mirror was a gift to Sinbad from a genie. It is said to possess magical powers. - Hmm. Looks like an ordinary mirror to me. - Legend has it, Your Royal Highness, when you make love in front of this mirror, then you will fall in love. Hmm. - Would you like to try? - I'm obliged. It's in the rules of the contest. The truth was the mirror was quite ordinary. Its legend came from Scheherazade's imagination. - And that, my lords and ladies, is the story of how I became consort to the sultan. For the next 1,001 nights, I told the great Khan stories. If we had the time, I would love to tell you one of these tales. But perhaps another time.
