We are going to have to talk about this later. Kharan will be finished with high school, and married with children by the time you decide. We need to talk now, I need to know are you going to be able to help me with his clothes this week? Steve, he's your responsibility too, you know? You don't have to keep telling me that, Thelma. I know he's my responsibility. It's just, I have a lot of bills right now. Look, I'll get around to it when I get the chance. Steve, you've been saying that shit for six months. He needs fucking clothes, not promises. Listen, I'm over here busting my ass, and every time I talk to you, you always got your hands out. It would help if you get a job too, ya know? You know I can never be nice to you. You're one ungrateful mother fucker. I never attempted to take your ass to court, because I know you have other children to raise, but you still don't give a damn. Look, the last thing I need from you right now is your fucking sarcasm. I don't need you to tell me I don't care for my son. I love Kharan. I care for him more than you think. Oh, I bet you will, when I take your ass to court. Yo, that was crazy. Did you see the moves he was doing back there? Man, I could do those moves. Man, you ain't nice. What? I was, let's go and get my white gloves. All right, come on. What you doin' with the money you get from welfare? You got some set of ball. Who the hell are you to tell me what to do with the money that I get to support this family? If I was making $100,000 a year, that still won't hide the fact that you have a responsibility to take care of. You know what, I just bought Kharan a new pair of sneakers, and I could not afford it. I walk around here like a fucking bum, but see that difference between me and you? I'll sacrifice anything to make my son happy. But that's what mothers are for. That's what mothers are for. I won't take this shit, I'm outta here. You know what Steve? Keep your fucking money, we don't need your ass anyway. You get your cap and gown yet? Nah, man. I aint even got my suit. Yo, Tim what's up? Got your stuff? Hell yeah, I got my shit. So, what you gonna do then? I don't know, man. It's not like I can ask my mom, she's struggling her damn self. True.

Nah men, I aint got my shit neither yo. - Damn. - Word. So what you gonna do? I don't know. I thought about selling newspapers over by the Brooklyn Bridge. How much they paying?

I'm tired of us looking like fucking bums. So, what are you gonna do then? I don't know. Guess I'll just sell newspapers with your ass. Aight then, bet. Yo, don't worry about it, aight?. Everything will fall into place, you'll see. What's up man, you down? My fat ass is not selling no newspapers. Get the fuck out of here. Yo, what's up, nigga? What up, man? Yo, what up, kid?

And you only did a year? Hell no, you know my moms the cops, I beat that shit nigga. So, what you been up to? You know, moms sent me down south for a little while, you know, to stay out of trouble. So, how'd you get back? Yo, I even gonna lie, that shit was my fault. Yo, this dude came up to me talking about, "You working?" I was on the avenue by myself, slow as hell, so I didn't think nothing of it. Yo, I swear to God, this nigga look like a fucking crack head. So, we went through the transactions, and whatnot. And guess what? Five four. I feel you man, they be fucking with me all the time, yo. You know yourself, I don't get down with that shit. They know we be hustling out here, but they always fucking with the niggas, I don't do that shit. Yo, nigga don't sleep, they be fucking with us too. You saw what happened to me. But you know what? I didn't give a fuck. Yo, I was straight struggling. Somebody else is gonna do it, it might as well be me. I feel you, man. I'm struggling my damn self. You know you my dogs, right? Anytime you want to get down, you let a nigga know. Man, you still doing that shit? Nigga, what did I just tell you? I ain't gonna let nobody stop me from making this money. Yo Kharan, we got this whole side sewed the fuck up. Its like that, huh? Hell yeah, nigga. This is where it's at. Damn, man! Yo, hold up man, I'm coming just now, aight?. You still fucking with them pussy ass niggas? Yeah man, sure, you know those my boys. Man, fuck them niggas niggas. Listen, think about what I said, if you sick of struggling, you want to get down and make some real money, I got you, aight? Aight, man. I'm out here though, keep out of trouble, man, stay up. Aight. Aight. Yo, man. What up? Yo, what he say to you? Oh, we was just kickin' it, man, I aint seen him in a while, that's all. I really hate that dude. The hell you talking to him for? Come on, man, he ain't even like that. But, check it, man, I got paid today. Go check out a flick man, I hear there's gonna be mad honeys there tonight. That's what I'm saying, man. Oh, come on. What's up, ma? Hey, Kharan. Ma, my father call? No, I haven't heard from him in two months. He knew my graduation was in two months. Yeah I know, don't worry, God don't like ugly. I know, I just hope that he can come to this one, that's all. Listen, why don't you call him? Maybe if you call him, maybe then, he'll finally become a father. But don't get disappointed, 'cause you know he's good for that. Vroom, vroom, vroom. Hello? Hello, may I speak to my father, please? Who, daddy? Who is this? Kharan, may I speak to my father, please? Kharan, who? Boy, didn't I tell you stop picking up my damn phone? Give me that phone. What is wrong with you? Go in your room, before I whip that tail! Never listen! Hello, who's calling? Hi, this is Kharan, may I speak to my father please. Oh, hey, Kharan, no, he's not here at the moment, you want me to tell him to give you a call when he gets in? Yes, please. I was just calling to let him know that my graduation was next week, and if he was still coming? Oh, wow, congratulations, honey. I didn't even know that you were graduating. He never mentioned anything to me about that. And besides, we're going on vacation next week. So, I'll tell him to give you a call though, okay? Um, thank you. All right, and congratulations again, babe. Bye. Can't speak? You look upset, that's why I ain't say nothing. I'm sorry for scaring you. I'm just not having a very good day, that's all. You wanna tell me about it? Yeah, you would like to know. P, I wasn't trying to, you know what, forget it. Just joking, my God Kharan. So what happened? I lost my job today. Word? I'm sorry to hear that. How'd that happen? You know the ANP over and 125th Street Third Avenue? You worked there? I didn't know that. Yeah, I don't think the bookkeeper ever liked me, I feel like she was had something against me, I just never knew what it was. Why you think that? Well every day for the last couple of weeks, she's been complaining that my drawer always come up short. Well, has it? No, I just could never prove it. It's kind of hard to explain. I think the manager was in on it too, though.. How you figure all that? 'Cause he's been making passes at me ever since I started working there. Baz was old enough to be my father. Well why didn't you just go over they head, and just quit sooner? I just needed to stay there another couple months, you know? I've been saving up for a car, something just get around in. You know what? Think I can help you out. How? The only way that you can help me is to come with me while I wait for her to get off work, so I can drag her down to 125th Street till her face drops. I just need to know when the cops are coming. You funny as hell. For real though, you know that Pathmark down by the Manhattan Bridge? Mhm. Well, paying good money, going down for the application myself. So, come if you want. Really, right now? I can't go anywhere with you looking like that. You look dirty. Come on, and I was just going in the house to change. I wouldn't get on the train looking like this. I'll be right back, aight? So, you're just gonna leave me out here? I mean, you live in the next building. Well, that's the thing, I forgot to tell you, I left my keys at the house this morning, and my mom doesn't get home until tonight. So, why you in here for? I didn't have the keys to get into my building. So when someone came out of this building, I just came in and waited. Oh, okay, so wait here then. You can't leave me out here in this creepy hallway. Look, my moms is not home, and if she came in, and saw you sitting in the house, she's gonna think something. Think what, my god Kharan, how long is it going to take for you to change anyway? Even if she did come home, it's not like, I'll tell her what happened. You don't know my moms, yo, she mad strict, man, she won't play that shit. Stop being so paranoid. Look at how much how much time you're wasting. Okay, okay. Nothing's gonna happen. You're wasting so much time, we could have been on the train already. Okay, okay! Yo, come on. Yo, wait. Now, you sure when my mother comes in, you're gonna explain to her... Yes Kharan, come on, I'm not gonna bite you. I'm just making sure, aight? Come on, follow me. Look, you can sit right there, and don't touch anything! If my mother walks in... I know, I'll explain, my God. I'm just making sure. Aren't you gonna take a shower? What? What do you mean, like I was gonna do all that when I saw you. I mean, I'm just trying to hurry up, so I can help you. I know you need this job too. I think that's disgusting. How can you put on clean clothes without taking a bath? Why you don't listen? I told you I was gonna do all that when I saw you. I gotta hurry up. And I don't need my mother walking in and I'm butt ass. I'm not going anywhere with you, unless you take a shower. What's it gonna take, five minutes? Okay, Pam. Alright Just wait here please. And if my mother walks in... I know, I will explain to her talk, you talk too much. The fuck? Who the fuck she think she is calling me dirty? Oh shoot. This fucking girl's crazy, man. My moms gonna kill me. She left. Drop the towel, Kharan. Shit. What? No, hell no. No, you buggin'. Come on. Stop, for real. Come on, whatchu doing? Drop the towel, Kharan. I'm not gonna bite you. Yo, yo there goes Pamela man, I think she's going to that party. Man, I don't even think about her ass no more. Man, come on, that was five years ago. And? Aw man, stop frontin', yo. Anyway, though, if you don't want her, I'll take her, she looking good as hell. I don't know. Well. Man, go ahead then. What? Nah, nah, she over there with her stupid ass friends anyway.

Come on, Mom, food stamps again? Listen, when you start working, and paying some goddamn bills in here, then you worry about the money you see, until then, take that shit, and go to the store.

All right, listen, let's go upstairs. There ain't nothing we could do for him now. Aight, besides, that's the life he chose, so come on. He was just trying to defend himself. Jason, look, if he was not living that life, he wouldn't have a need to defend himself, man. Aight? You don't feel sorry for him, you feel sorry for his family. Aight, come on. Jason, come on. What up, man? Where Mike at? Down aisle five. Yo! What up, homie? No, I ain't seen you since the funeral, what's going on? No, I'm just tryna stay away from you. What's that supposed to mean? No, you know what I'm talking about, aight? My God. I know you're not blaming me for that shit that happened to Jeff. Yo, all I'm saying is that if he wasn't selling for you, he wouldn't have gotten killed. Besides, me, our little brother, Pam, Tim, and everyone else was out there was almost killed along with Jeff. I mean, thank God Pam didn't have your son with her. What? Yo man, what the fuck you talking about, man? I didn't put a gun to that nigga head and say, "You better sell drugs for me", matter of fact, he came to me. Yo, look Jeff was protecting what was his, and you would do the same thing, if you was in that position. What? Are you kidding me? You mean belittle myself, right? And sell drugs for your punk ass, right? Look, I wont be selling drugs for you, or anyone else, for that matter. What the fuck you trying to say, man? You deaf? You heard me the first time, fuck you gonna do shoot me, what? Come on, man, I ain't even trying to go there with you. Come on, we like family, man.

I don't mean to sound messed up when I say this, but you know, times is hard, man. And besides, I got a mouth to feed. Yo, Kharan, I don't wanna hear that, aight? We all went through the same struggles, had the same pressure. It's that you, and that idiot, Timothy, went left field. Look at me. Do you see me out there doing that? I don't got time to be looking over my shoulder, 'cause I love life. All right, all right man, I'm not trying to argue with you. Come on, man, we've been cool too long for this. You know you the first dude I met around the way when I moved, right? Yeah. You my boy, man. All right. Yo, listen, I know you can't change overnight. But, you got to start somewhere, or you ain't gonna see your son grow up. All right. Come on, man, I thought about all that, man, it's just... Aight, I love you like a brother.

Why is it that everybody blaming me for that shit, that shit wasn't my fault. Then why did you have a gun? Why were you out there shooting? For protection! To protect what?

But, there's nothing we can do for him now, yo. We gotta go. It wasn't my fault. I know, I know. They didn't have to kill him. Yo, Kharan, listen to me, we have to get out of here before the cops come, all right? Come on. We can't leave him like this, man. Listen, I don't wanna leave him either, all right? I care about him just as much as you do. But, if we don't get out of here, we're gonna go to fucking jail, all right? Come on! Get the fuck off of me! Fuck the cops, man!

I don't give a fuck if I gotta drag you out of here by your motherfucking feet. You coming with me, all right? Get the fuck off of me. You know what, all right. If you don't want to go, then at least think about your son. Listen, you are never gonna see him after some shit like this, all right? Come on. Come on. Love you man. What's up, man? Long time, no see. Yeah, man, I been chilling. How's your friend? I don't know, how much? A dollar. Aight, man. Thank you. Man, I should've finished school. Only thing I got to show for this shit is jewelry, clothes, and a fucking Lexus. Thought this shit would bring me happiness. Instead, it's only bringing me closer to hell. I can't see my son when I want, I'm still living at home with my moms, sometimes I gotta sleep in my fucking car. I'm tired of looking over my fucking shoulder all the time. Me and my family's lives are always on the line, and to top it off, two of my boys are fucking dead, man. Sometimes I wanna get out of this shit, just keep re-fucking-coiling, shit is like a magnet, man. There's just so much money involved. If there's one thing I know, it's that shit is leading me closer and closer to death. The crazy shit is, nigga that turned me onto the game turned against me. Shit is crazy. Yeah, play yourself, motherfucker. I got three bullets, each with your name on it. I don't give a fuck. Thought so. Sick of looking over my fucking shoulder, man. I gotta get out of this shit soon. Fuck you, nigga. Yo, what up, Jason? What happened the other night? What night? You know what night I'm talking about. Nah, nigga, I don't know what night you talkin' about. You know your brother was down with that shit. What about my brother? What you gettin' attitude for? You know your brother was down with that shit. Yo, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know you mentioned my brother's name. If you're talking about that night at the party, he aint have shit to do with it. So, you better get out your head, right now. Man, fuck you. You know your brother was down with that shit. Jason, you up? Yeah, mom, I'm up. Listen, I was too upset with you this afternoon. And I need to know, what kind of fight did you get into to get yourself suspended? What's going on with that? Sit up while I'm talking to you, sit up. I don't know, mom. Listen, Jason. I know you're the type of kid to not just get in a fight for no apparent reason. Now, I need for you to tell me, what the heck is going on? Well, remember that night at the party Tim T. was murdered? Yeah. Well, Michael was there. What do you mean Michael was there? Mike, Michael was there but he had nothing to do it. Him and Macron, they was hanging out, but they best friends, he had nothing to do with it. What happened? Well, every day, every other day, I have some fool asking me stupid questions about that night at the party, and questions about Michael. So, what do they say? They say stuff like, "Oh I heard your brother got shot", or, "Michael and Kharan, they shot up the place", or, "I heard you brother murdered someone." So I just got so sick of it, and just beat the living mess head. All right, now, I heard that boy went to the hospital with a broken nose. Good for him. You know what, Jason? Listen, I don't want you to getting into any more trouble. Look at me. I don't want you getting into any more trouble. You know how this neighborhood is, but it doesn't matter. You need to ignore these people. Its hard, ma. I know it's hard, but if you don't ignore them, you're gonna end up as miserable as they are, and I raised you and your brother better than that. You're better, you're like the best sons a mom could ever have. You know that Michael's going to college soon. Now, listen, I want you do me a favor, okay? I don't want you to get into any more trouble. I want to have grandchildren one day. I will, I love you, ma. I love you too, Jason. Oh, shit! Turn this shit up, motherfucker, this that shit. This the jam! Nah man, you do it motherfucker, look, I'm driving, man. Oh shit, yo nigga, yo, that's five oh, chill motherfucker, turn that shit down! Man, fuck them niggas, man. Yo nigga, you fucking crazy? Yo, we got a bunch of fucking artillery up in this motherfucker, puffing L's and shit. Nigga, turn this shit down, man. Yo, chill, motherfucker. Them niggas don't want to put this shit to a test. You know they don't wanna fuck with us. Man, yo, hold on. No, no, no, no. Aw, come on, man. Aw, come on. You see this shit? Ain't this shit beautiful? Yeah, baby. You know she pretty. You is a fool, man. Why don't you put that shit back in the bag, man? Aw man, you a little bitch, man. Whatever, man, whatever. Damn, shit! Yo, you see all that shit that motherfucker had? He had all kinds of shit. Man, I felt like taking it all. Know what I'm saying? I mean, yeah, he did have too many faces up in that motherfucker though, yo, besides man, this is where we got the heat. Nigga, I don't give a fuck! I'll still rob his ass. You know what I'm saying? Oh yo, yo, kill that window, kill that window. Yo, why, what's good, man? Ain't that motherfucker over there Michael? Oh, hell yeah! Yo, that's that nigga I was telling you about. Him and Kharan is like, mad tight, yo. He's like, next to killing him or some shit, man. Nah, yo, we gonna do this nigga, 'cause I know he be chilling with Kharan on the low, man. Hell yeah. Yeah, man. I told this nigga, Daniel, Michael was a sneaky motherfucker. Bless my nigga, D man. Let's go. Yo, Michael! Punk motherfucker. Michael. Who is it? Who is it? Kharan. How you doing? I'm fine, you? I ain't seen you in a while. Yeah. That's what I wanted to talk to you about. Can I come in? My mom and dad are away for the weekend, I guess so. Where's the baby? He's in the room asleep. Did you hear about Michael and Jason? Yeah. I just came back from the hospital from seeing Mike. He doing all right. But, what about his brother? He so messed up after what happened. He ain't even right. What's gonna happen to him? They gun he had was Jeff's, and Jeff already had a body on it, so, they gonna him with both murders. Goodness. I know he must be scared. I'm gonna visit him every chance I get. I just hope they ease up on him, this is his first offense. Jason didn't deserve this, at all. None of them did. So, what'd you come here for, Kharan? You need a shoulder to lean on, a place to hide out? You know you're next, I'm sorry, but I can't be seen around you anymore. I know. That's why I'm here. I was thinking about what you said. What happened? Everyone's dead, now you're gonna come crawling back? What you talking about, crawling back? Look, I'm not here because of them, I'm here because of you and the baby. I'm willing to do anything to make this work. Kharan, I'm not dealing with you, the killings, the drugs, the guns, none of it. I'm not taking a chance on me and my son's life. I know, and that's why I got rid of everything. My bags are packed, as we speak. I got this job down south, so we can... Wait, wait, wait a minute. Do you really expect me to believe that? I have a good life here. I'm not going anywhere with you, just because it took lives to be lost for you to finally wake up. Look, Pam. No, you look. Jason, Michael, Timothy, and Jeff were all really close to you. By you selling drugs, you put everyone's life in jeopardy. You've really helped mess this place up bad, it's not even the same anymore. And then, all you did was teach the younger generation what to do. That's why we have such such negative, such negativity revolving around us, because the animals like you. Why do you keep shitting on me, yo? What can't you just give me another chance? Kharan, I gave you a chance, and I got pregnant, then you became a bum drug dealer. That's all you drug dealers are, you're all bums. Damn, what woman would want a career drug dealer, huh? You don't understand. You don't know what my life was like, yo, my father didn't give a fuck about me. And I had to do what I had to do to take care of my mother too. Oh, that's right. I forgot, you had a hard life. Like the rest of us didn't? I don't feel sorry for you. The only people I feel sorry for are your friends, because you have a second chance, they don't. Look, can you please leave? Go and start your new life. Go. You're gonna regret this. Since the first day I met you. Everything is falling apart, I don't know why I have a worry in the world. I wish I could rewind time, and just start again. Oh my God, you know, I just miss my boys a lot. It just couldn't have been all my fault. I can't believe this shit. I had everything, friends money, jewelry, car, women. Now, I ain't got shit. I was younger, I thought I was under pressure. Open up the door, motherfucker. Pay back, motherfucker. I wish this shit was all a dream. Yo, hold up, man. Yeah, I'm coming just now, aight? Man, you still fucking with them pussy ass niggas? Come on, man, you know those are my boys, man. Man, fuck them niggas. Think about what I said. If you sick of struggling, you wanna get down, and make some real money, I got you. Aight? Nah, man, I thought I had it bad, but in reality, I'm not the one who has it bad, man. Yo, you stay up. You know I'ma hold it down, nigga. Aight. What up, man? What's good? What he say to you? Oh, we was just kicking it, man. We ain't seen each other in a while, that's all. I really hate that dude, the hell you talking to him for? It ain't even like that, yo! Yo, hold up, man. I got paid today today, yo. Go check out a flick. Hear there's gonna be mad honeys there today. Aight. Come on, man! I'm glad this shit is all a dream.
