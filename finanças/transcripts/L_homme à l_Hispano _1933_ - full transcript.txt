THE MAN IN THE HISPANO CAR Here are the detailed accounts you asked for. And the money. 50,000 francs, eh? 49,700 exactly. That's not a lot of capital, obviously. Yes, and I had dreamed of a great fortune. You lack the ferocity for a great success. You're too soft, too sensitive. Oh yes, I am leaving. Mediocrity in France, no, thanks. Tomorrow, I take the train for Bordeaux. The day after, I sail for Senegal. Hello. You're returning to Biarritz? Yes and you? Me too. Good business in Paris? Not really. I lost a million. But it consoles me to know my partner lost as much as I did. That's funny! What are you buying? A detective novel. And a love story. That's even worse. You don't believe in love? Love? What's that? I don't know it. By the way, what car are you in? Number 5. Great. That's not mine. - Good-bye, old friend. - Goodbye. - You'll come back. - Yes, yes. You insist on looking at the landscape. What's so great about it? It's my country and I'm seeing it for the last time. Why? Are you going to kill yourself? No, don't worry: I'm just leaving for Senegal. For a long time? For a very long time. Bravo! I love people who get the hell out of here. Then I'm sure never to see them again. Why are you going into exile? A broken heart? Money? You did something reckless? Is that your business? No, but I want to know why you want the shade up. If you don't have a broken heart, I don't care, and I'd pull the shade down. However, if you're unhappy or poor, I'd let you keep it up. Well, then, keep it up. I like you very much. I don't feel the same. Then I like you even more. At this pace, we'll be in Biarritz by nightfall. In Biarritz? You idiot, you know I'm taking the train in Bordeaux. I'm not going to Biarritz to show my wife the car I bought my mistress. Just tell her the car is mine. That would be an idea, but I can't. Bordeaux. Farewell, sir, and good luck. Farewell. - Are you married? - No. Bravo. Me, I am. You're what? - Married. And my wife regrets it more than I do. I don't doubt it. Call me a car, I'm going to sail on the Niger. The Niger isn't leaving. There's a problem with the engine. - Really? - Yes, it's right here. Call me a car anyway. I'll stop by the company office. George? Don't you recognize me? Deleone. Your old army pal! Oh, how are you? I'm glad to see you. You've lost weight. Well, I'm doing fine. What are you doing here? I just got here. I was going to sail for Senegal tonight. But I just heard the boat has an engine problem. It won't leave for at least five days. So, what are you going to do? No idea. I was going to the company office to get more information. After that, I don't know. After... After... I have an idea. If you would come with me to Biarritz, you'd do me a great favor. Do you know Florimonde? Florimonde. The star of the Folies Berg√®re? That's my girlfriend. Congratulations. You see, the Hispano car? I bought it for her. I'm going to give it to her. But I don't see the connection between this Hispano, Ms. Florimonde and my stay in Biarritz. You're going to understand. Florimonde is in Biarritz. And my wife too. I can't have my wife see me in my girlfriend's car, right? - So? - So, you come to Biarritz, you drive the Hispano, people think it's yours, when you leave, Florimonde gets her car. And then everyone believes I gave this present to her. Your story seems complicated. No, old friend, no complications, it's all set. You're coming with me. You take the train. I'm going to Biarritz with Mr. Dewalter. Tomorrow, you'll be at Mr. Dewalter's disposal. Take care of his luggage. And remember for everyone there, the Hispano belongs to Mr. Dewalter. - Understand? - Yes. We'll have a fortnight's fun in Biarritz. A fortnight? Yes, your boat won't be ready for at least a fortnight. So for two weeks, Miss Florimonde won't have her car. If she leaves Biarritz before you do, I'll give her the Hispano in Paris. So let's go, off to Biarritz! I'm wondering what I'm doing here. Well, you're helping me, that's all. I'm helping you to do a bad thing. Cheating on my wife, a bad thing? Are you kidding? You never lie to women? Me, never. So women lie to you. Who is that man? He's a good friend of my husband. I've known him for three days. Mr. Dewalter, do you know Mrs. Berton? You have a very nice car. When will you give me a car like that? When I'm as rich as Mr. Dewalter. Mr. George Dewalter, Lady Oswild. My dear friend, I have a favor to ask. You're interested in her. I understand, she's charming. But, my friend, her husband is a real jerk. Oh, him too? Lady Oswild wants someone to take her home. George, take her home with your car. Do you mind? See, my friend, the benefit of having one's own car? Thank you, sir, for taking me home. I'm glad I could be of use. It's strange we've never met through our mutual friends. I'm rarely in France. Are you staying in Biarritz for a while? No, I'm leaving for Senegal soon. You're a great traveler. Yes, taking care of business. I also hunt a lot. May I see you again? I don't know, but I often have tea at the English pastry shop. Here he comes, just as he has every day for the past week. Have you noticed his eyes? No, I've noticed his Hispano car. He's here. Who would believe it? And you the goody two shoes. I don't believe it myself. I thought you didn't believe in love. I hadn't met him yet. I'll leave you two. You'll excuse me? - Yes. - Good-bye. Here you are. Here I am. Am I late? No, but I'm always afraid you won't come. Why wouldn't I come? Haven't I kept my word for eight days? For eight days, you've allowed me to see you almost every afternoon. It's too beautiful. I would never have hoped for it. Well, buddy, you're playing terrible golf. You're stronger with the little ladies, eh? That's for sure. I'm lucky with women. Listen, I'm going to tell you... Oh, another love story... well, if it makes you happy. You know that the beautiful Florimonde is my girlfriend. Do you know her? Florimonde, the star of the Folies? No, but it doesn't matter: All women are alike. She really wanted a new car. So I bought a Hispano for her. Geez, a Hispano! You give her anything she wants? She loves me. I'd do anything for her. No. No one loves anyone. Come on, listen to my story. Florimonde is performing in Biarritz for a week. And I decided to surprise her. I came back from Paris with the Hispano. You see the trouble? Imagine if my wife had seen me in the car. Well, my friend, everything worked out. - Lucky. - Yes, lucky. In Bordeaux, I met my old army buddy George Dewalter. Walter? He came to spend five days here and I lent him my car. All Biarritz thinks it's his. When he leaves, Florimonde will get her car and my wife won't know a thing. All this proves that love is an abuse of trust. No, I prefer a whisky and soda. Let's go have a drink at the English pastry shop. It's better than here. No, I've had enough. Fine. Good-bye. How strange life is! The other day when you arrived, I was about to leave. If you had arrived five minutes later, we would never have met. - Impossible. - Why? It was meant to be. I have to go. It's late. - Already? - Yes, already. Will I see you tomorrow? Yes. Would you like to lunch together? - With your friend? - No, alone. Why are you looking at me that way? You remind me of someone. Who? Someone I didn't know, someone I was waiting for. Well, well, well. Hello. Hello, hello. Well, emigrant, come have a drink with me. No, take one. And what about Senegal? What would you like? A martini? Two dry martinis. You are surprised to see me here. Not at all. I know the story of the Hispano. But don't worry. I'm the only one. I heard it from my friend when we were playing golf. He believes you're rich. I didn't tell him otherwise. It's funnier that way. Yeah, it's funny. For a poor guy who comes here with a millionaire's car. For eight days? That's pretty funny. I don't think so. Oh, there's a woman behind this. You're in love. I've never met a woman like her. That's it. And she saw you in the Hispano. She took you for what you're not. May I give you some advice? Sleep with the girl and then leave. Otherwise you're not a man. You're not very sensitive, eh? Me, not at all. I can see that. Good-bye. Here I am, my dear. I wanted to tell you tomorrow we're leaving for Morocco. - What, "we"? - You and I. I'm sorry, but you'll go alone. You don't need me. I never need you. But you usually come with me when I ask you to. This time, don't ask me. Why? Because I would say no. That's right. When I cheated on you, I asked you not to divorce me. I stopped you from leaving. So you said, "I'm free". I agreed. What are you doing tomorrow? I'm going to the Savoy, dancing. I won't stop you from going. Who will be there? Deleone, his wife, and a friend. Deleone, his wife, and... it isn't that man who has the beautiful Hispano? - Mister... - Dewalter. Oh, that's funny. - You think so? - I do. So you're having dinner with Mr. Dewalter. Good. We'll talk about this again. What does that mean? It means nothing. And if it meant something, I wouldn't tell you what it meant. But forget this ridiculous conversation. Do what you please. I'm sorry to have invited to go to Morocco. I'll go alone, tomorrow, by plane. And when I say I'm leaving for Africa, I do it. Luxury suits you. Indeed, I couldn't live without it. You couldn't either. Not to have jewelry and flowers anymore... You're always sad. Don't hold it against me. You're all I wanted, with all your splendor and charm. Everything that's impossible for me. Why impossible? Because one day I'll have to leave. Why? For where? Africa. Africa? Yes, Africa, where everyone goes for the hunt. You travel all over. - Aren't you happy? - And you? You've never been unhappy? Often. But I think I won't be that way anymore. And tonight, I'm so happy, I could die without regrets. Die? But you have to live. I'm so sad, Stephane, don't be mad at me. What's going on. What's wrong? I have to leave today. But for Paris. What do you mean? You're leaving? A close friend's calling me to Paris. He needs me. I would rather stay with you. But I must leave. You're right, George. Let's leave. Because your friend needs you. We had dreamed about leaving this place with its annoying obligations. I was thinking of Rome, since you wanted to see it again. But Paris is even better. What are you talking about? I don't dare to understand. George, do you think I would let you leave alone? I am going back to Paris today. Do you want me to drive your car again? You'd better leave with it because everyone thinks it's yours. And to whom should I give it there? Nobody. Wait for me. I'd like to give the present myself. Okay, so I'll leave it at the shop. You can use it, if you'd like. But you'll pay for the gas. Agreed. Thank you. Good-bye. Morocco flight. Very cloudy. Visibility: Poor. Would you like some gin? Soda. I tried to call Biarritz to tell my wife I'm coming home. She'll be so happy to see me. Don't you understand? Do you speak French? No speak English? So, I will tell you something funny. My wife is having a flirtation with a poor man who pretends to be a millionaire. What a laugh. When she knows the truth, she'll be fed up with love and flirting. Biarritz on the telephone. Call Milady. Hurry. It's Milord calling. What, she left for Paris? What? In a car? What? In a Hispano? Quiet, idiot! Good night, Madame. Is this okay? Yes. How much? 8000 francs per month. Fine. When do you want to move in? Today. Great. I need one month in advance. I'll prepare a receipt for you. - Here you are. - Thank you, sir. My love. I'm free. You are carrying me off. Come. Choose. Spain. Egypt. The Indies. The whole world. Good morning, James. What's the news? They've announced the winners of the dog show in Monte Carlo. Well, well, well, 100 pounds to the man from the kennel. What about the stock rates? Rubber is falling. 28.50. The value is rising. Take 10,000 units. And the detective? I asked him to come. He's waiting in the back room. Ok, let him come in. And everyone get out! Here you are. So. Do your dirty job. Where does that... what's his name... Dewalter come from? I was able to get some important information. Good family, good education, orphaned at 16, no money. Enough chit chat. The facts. Here I have the whole file. I've done my work. I have certificates from all his employers. He had only minor jobs. He was living in a small furnished room, not very elegant. 200 francs per week. And then... he had to leave for Senegal. Yes, I already know. Ok. Put your dossier here. I'll look at it later. When did they arrive in Paris? Eight days ago. In a wonderful Hispano. Where was he able to get it? That's what I didn't find. Continue. Madame, sorry, Milady, went to the Ritz hotel. The first night Mr. Dewalter went to his former room, but then the next day, he rented a furnished apartment 127 Sufresne Ave. A very nice apartment, 10,000 francs per month. One month in advance. Where does he get the money? Quiet. I'm not paying you to give me riddles. All right, Milord. I must say that Madame, pardon, Milady. Yes, continue. I understand. So Madame visited him on a regular basis. On Sunday they went to a concert. On Monday they had lunch in Fontainebleau. And then they went back to their apartment. And... And then I don't know how to say this, they never left that night. You don't know what you're saying. I'm sure of my information. You bloody blackmailing scoundrel! I've a damn good mind to drown you. Get the hell out of here. My secretary will pay you. And don't tell anyone this. Dirty dog! Jean! Paul! Dress me. Pull the car around. We leave in 10 minutes. The little house where you were born; I wouldn't sell it, George. Here's the little bit of money it's worth. A few notes. You can pay me back later. So now, go. You promised me. Yes, I promise you. In three days, Stephane is going back to Biarritz; I'll leave when she's gone. I'll write what I can't say to her. One day, you'll forget her? No, my friend. No, of my whole life, she's the only memory I'll keep. Poor thing. Don't feel sorry for me. I've had 15 unforgettable days. And I'm not unhappy now. It's 5 p.m., and she's leaving the Ritz to come to my place. In a few minutes, I'll be a rich man. And I'll believe it. Is this Mr. Dewalter's apartment? Yes, but he is not home. I know, but there's someone I want to see. - But, Sir. - Leave me alone. If you're not happy, tell your employer to increase your pay. He's rich enough for that. Ah, hello! What are you doing here? I went to the Ritz, where you usually stay, and I didn't find you there, but I did my best to find out... your new address. Wherever you are, I can come, I should think. I'm your husband. You forget our agreement. I'm free. I'm not home. Then I'm at Mr. Dewalter's. Congratulations. In Biarritz, he had a beautiful car; In Paris, he has a beautiful apartment. You know Mr. Dewalter? Yes, I knew one. No connection with yours. What are you going to do? See Mr. Dewalter. - I won't let you. - Why? I know you. You are not without honor. Without pride. Mr. Dewalter to please you is certainly virtuous. - He is. - He is. Also, you're not in Biarritz, you are not at the Ritz. You're at Mr. Dewalter's. A very good man. A rich man. Honorable. A man in a position to marry you. Well. I'm going to divorce you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You could have stood in my way. No, I wouldn't have done that. Rich and beautiful as you are, my job is to protect you from adventurers. Mr. Dewalter's case is different. You couldn't have had a better opportunity. There's only one thing I'm asking you. Agreed. - In advance? - In advance. What do you want from him? I want to announce myself to Mr Dewalter his good fortune. Here he comes. I ask you to leave us alone. - And if I say no? - You promised. I just want Mr. Dewalter to know me. There's a gentleman with the lady. An Englishman. Yes? Thank you. Yes, it's me, the husband. Small world, isn't it? Did you see her? My wife? Yes, I saw her. So, she knows? She knows nothing at all. I'm not crazy. If she heard the truth from me, she would be mad at me. No. I had a better idea. It's you who'll tell her. "I am an adventurer. You have millions, and I don't have a penny." And you can add, it will work out. Let's not fight, soon we'll take each other's hand. Be quiet. I thought when I came here that my wife... but no, she doesn't know anything. You haven't dared tell her who you are. Scoundrel! I'm leaving, understand? A clean break, with nothing. I'm leaving. No, you won't leave. You'll stay. I don't want her to cry over you. You can't leave any more. I'm getting divorced, yes, because of you. You're a gentleman. And you're going to marry the woman you've compromised. Now you're rich. But you're going to have to tell her. Admit it and she will hear you. We've just finished, Mr Dewalter and I. You see, everything went well. Goodbye. Mr. Dewalter, you're a perfect gentleman. - So he told you. - Yes. I never thought he'd give me my freedom so quickly. Free. George, I'm free! Are you happy? I love you more than life. You know, I'm afraid of having too much happiness. Listen, love. If we left Paris, could we go live in your home in the sun? Leave the difficulties to the businessmen. Oh, George. Let's go to my place in Oleron. I would be so happy to show you the house where I was born. My beautiful gardens, my great trees, and the pond... I was afraid of when I was younger. Do you understand what he did? And I'm now stuck because Stephane is getting a divorce for me. So we're leaving right away to go to her hometown to the family chateau. What's left of the money? - Yesterday 15,000; Today 11,000. Tomorrow... Aren't they sweet? But for the moment, back to work. It's not the wedding yet. And tomorrow, for the lady's birthday, we will have 22 guests. And 50 for the dance. And we need a nice, quiet room for Mr. Normand, the notary. So, not too tired? No. But why did you ask me here? No reason. I just wanted to see you. So, is it working out? Not yet. But it will. Stephane, my old friend, Mr. Normand. And your notary. We're going to need you soon. Sorry, I'm running late. I have to dress for dinner. Of course, I understand you. See you later. The first day of hunting season, we had 250 partridges. No. Yes. 250. A beautiful sight. Where do you hunt? La Fert√© and LamotteBeuvron. In Sologne? Mr. Dewalter must be one of your neighbors. If I recall correctly, you told me that... Dewalter, Dewalter. You have property in Sologne? Why have I never met you? That's not surprising. I don't hunt in France anymore. Why are your dogs barking? Are they seeing a ghost? The will o' the wisps on the pond worry them. There are no ghosts. How are you, Antoinette? You always look like a potato in a bathrobe. What are you doing here, sir? In this house, where I have the right to come, when I arrive, the dogs bark and old ladies show their teeth. Don't move, Antoinette. Don't try to run away. I scare women, even the old ones. Antoinette, a ridiculous old man arrived here earlier. An old man, quite ridiculous. It's the notary. Mr. Dewalter's old friend. Go and get him right away. Without telling the others. If you tell anyone else, I'll kill you, old potato. I'll kill the notary. I'll kill the lady. I'll kill her lover. I'll kill the dog. I'll kill everybody. Understood? Good. I'll be in the library. Go. That's strange. I feel like I've met you before, Mr. Dewalter. I don't know where. Me neither. When shooting pigeons, maybe? In China? You know China? Yes. I own vast property there. Filled with chimera. You don't look like a dreamer. You don't think so? No, you're neat. Cold. Stephane, do you think Mr. Dewalter is a dreamer? - He's a poet. If he were ambitious... Well, I am. But what else could I wish for now? What do you want from me, sir? What do I want? I want you to get rid of right now and forever, of Mr. Dewalter. Yes. I wanted to divorce, but not anymore. I've figured out in the past three weeks that I care about my wife. I don't love her, but I care about her. Bring your friend. My friend will leave. He promised me. - He never lies. - He never lies? He never lies? So my wife knows he's destitute? That's something else. He got caught in up it. His first weakness was understandable. That led him to play a character that he can't escape now. Love's lie is only a desire to look better. Let's cut to the chase, shall we? I don't want Mr. Dewalter, as interesting as he is, to continue to entertain Lady Oswild. So I'll give 200,000 francs to your friend. A check payable in Senegal. Tell him. I won't tell him. You will tell him. I have in my pocket his whole dossier. The receipt for his furnished room. 200 francs per week. Not very expensive. And I have other things: Enough to put him in his place after dinner. If you have all that, why offer money? For two reasons. First, because I'm afraid my wife will keep him anyway. Women are so stupid. And also because I remember something he told me on the train. I pity him. Nobody's perfect. And what if he just leaves? Don't be dramatic. But if he simply leaves. Will you denounce him? He won't leave. Mr. Le Normand, convince your friend. And bring his answer to me. He must leave. If not, later, in front of everybody, I'll take care of him. Too bad for my wife. So, what will you do? I'm going to try to make a deal. We'll agree or we won't, that's all. I don't understand you. You've changed. Not for the better. No, I haven't changed. I'm just a bit moved because I'm getting ready for something serious. See you later, Mr. Le Normand. Wait for me here. So, what have you decided? I'm going to leave, Mr. Oswild. I guessed that. I've prepared the check. 200,000 francs. At the end of the year, you won't even notice it. The end of the month. For me, it's life. You can make your fortune with that. You don't want to leave? Enough. What will you tell your wife? None of your business. It is! It is understood that after I disappear, that never, under any circumstances, any... that you will tell no one, in the whole world, what you know of me. So you are leaving? I disappear. And you stay quiet. That's our pact. Understand? I understand. And I accept the pact. You disappear, and I say nothing. Nothing, ever. Nothing, ever. You have my word. The pond! Someone just fell in the pond! Quickly! Quickly! It's already too late. Your friend won't be saved. You killed him! No. It was him. Mr. Dewalter kept his word. I will keep mine. Don't pity him too much. His memory is still here. You should let them know that your friend, your rich friend, just died in an accident.
