[MUSIC - "PACHELBEL'S CANON"] >> Is it possible to hack the afterlife for answers to our deepest questions about life? There are three methods in this documentary-- hypnotherapy, mediumship, and asking questions of those who've had a near-death experience. Having filmed 100 people talking about the afterlife, with or without hypnosis, the results are the same. "Hacking the Afterlife." >> The show will begin in 30 seconds. [TRUMPETING] >> Welcome to the Past Lives Pavilion. >> Ah. >> Oh my god. >> In a moment, you will be asked to place your right hand on the plate next to you. An image of yourself in a former life will soon appear. Since we want to be fair and accommodate everyone, you will be limited to five past lives only. Thank you. >> What the hell is this? >> Elizabeth, time for supper, darling. >> Be there in a moment, mumsie. >> What the hell's going on here? >> Yeaaaah. >> [SCREAMS]. >> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. [ROARING] >> Come on then. To the castle. [NEIGHING] It's incredible. >> Who were you? >> I'm Prince valiant. >> Really. >> Yeah. Who are you? >> Dinner. >> Part One-- Hacking the Afterlife with Hypnotherapy. [MUSIC PLAYING] >> Follow along with this one, if you will please, panel. I, Virginia Tighe, Underwent a unique experiment some 15 years ago. While in a hypnotic trance, I recreated intimate details of the life of a young girl who was born in County Cork, Ireland, in 1798. Fantastic as it may seem, I felt that I had lived another life. I remembered my family in Ireland, the school I attended, the specific grocery store where I traded, and the prayer I used to recite before meals. I even was able to draw an accurate map of where I lived 150 years ago. And when I talked, I spoke with a genuine Irish brogue using old-fashioned words no longer common today. When my experiences were written up in newspapers, there erupted a storm of controversy. People called the story a hoax. So an interested newspaper reporter decided to go to Ireland and check it out. He astounded the world by finding concrete evidence that corroborated dozens of details that I had outlined in my trance. You may remember my other name-- Bridey Murphy. >> 18-something. 1806. >> 1806. >> The people who come to our Institute to learn the techniques that we have to teach with regard to life between lives under deep hypnosis are looking to gain a new insight as to the purpose of our existence here. Who am I? Where do I come from? Why am I here? Where am I going? These age-old questions are now being answered, I think, in many ways through the kind of hypnosis that we use to reach into the inner mind. >> And mind's made up, so let's find out who it is. Which one in truth is Virginia Tighe? Will the real Virginia Tighe please stand up. >> I got her. [APPLAUSE] >> People were very interested in this. And they knew that hypnosis had been used. And I would get calls, well, since you practice hypnosis, may I come to you for a past life regression. And in the '50s, I simply told them, no, I'm very traditional. I'm not involved with that kind of new age sort of thinking. I was very naive then really. >> In a body in another life, so here we go. Number one, number one, be there now. Move out of the tunnel and be there now. >> Um-hmm. Here I am. I'm some place in Europe. Seems like London. >> Is it day time or night time? >> It's daytime. And I have on-- you know the hat? Like a black hat-- a big black hat and black suit like Snidely Whiplash. And it's like I'm moving along the London streets. I'm slinking around the London streets like a cat. >> You're shielding it with your arms under your garments? >> I'm holding it. Yeah, I'm kind of pushing it into my jacket so nobody will see it. >> Back in 1980, Dr. Brian Weiss was using hypnotherapy with a patient named Catherine to discover the roots of her paralyzing phobias. In his book "Many Lives, Many Masters," he writes that during one of their sessions, Catherine regressed back to a time before she was born. >> She said, I don't know what this is, but I could already see it was intense. It was cathartic. It was emotional. And I didn't know why-- >> Because when you're hypnotized, you remember everything you're saying. >> Yes. Yeah, It's not something that you forget. You remember it. And-- >> So she probably couldn't believe it herself. >> For her, it was easier than for me-- >> To believe it. >> --because it was so-- yeah, to believe it-- it was so intense for her. She was experiencing it with emotions, and visually, and sounds, and other senses that it became easier over the weeks that followed for her to change her worldview. But for me, I needed more because I was such a skeptic, so left brain, so academic. And I started already explaining it away like, oh, maybe she saw movies, or read about this, or maybe it's the collective unconscious that the psychoanalyst Carl Jung wrote about or something else going on. But when she came back in the next week, her symptoms were disappearing. >> Using repetition is great for inducing hypnosis. So anything pet statements or part of your induction, it's OK to emphasize and repeat it over and over two or three times and then bring it up again later. >> Can you describe the scene for me and tell me about the environment you find yourself in? >> Where I popped into was me standing on a stage. It's like the Hollywood Bowl. And I'm looking out at the vast seating that's there. So if you can picture and imagine the Hollywood Bowl where we would normally be in the audience looking at the stage watching an artist, it's actually reversed for me. I'm actually the artist looking out. And in the first several sections are all of my spirit guides, guardian angels, those part of my life. And then in the audience behind that are just people that are interested in me and listening to what I have to say. You know, like the bowl, it's got a semicircle. >> Right. Is there something in particular, some issue being discussed? What's that all about? >> I'm actually presenting what my next life is going to be, much like you would do if you were defending a doctoral thesis. And all the professors are there. And they're asking you questions like "Why'd you choose this? What's the purpose? What kind of studying did you do? What were the tests?" You know, those types of inquiry questions. And I'm busy answering those questions about why I chose this particular body in this lifetime, and my parents, and what I'm going to be doing. >> Interesting. So while you're discussing this life to come, how do you feel about it? Are you eager to get started or doe you have some reluctance, or even trepidation, or perhaps you have mixed feelings? >> No, none of that. Very confident, feel very comfortable. I've done my research. I've done my studying. I know exactly what I want and what this life is going to do for me. And so all the questions I'm handling with ease, and with comfort, and eloquent in my responses and details when I need to be. >> So in a few moments at my count, we're going to move backward in time to your most recent previous lifetime or to some other past lifetime, incarnation, that's of most value for us to explore now. Already shifting. Just choose one, day time or night time. >> It's day time. >> Day time. >> Are you inside or outside? >> I'm outside. >> Outside. >> Standing on the street. >> On the street. And I'm a girl. >> Oh, OK. And about what's your age? What's the number that pops into your head as you stand on the street there? >> Nine or 10. >> Oh, so you're a young girl. >> Mm-hmm. >> OK. And what's the year? When you're standing here in this-- >> 19-- 1943. >> '43. [TRUMPETING MUSIC] >> Germany occupies Copenhagen. Hitler's troops disembarking from transports in the harbor carry out the Fuhrer's latest act of aggression-- the invasion of peaceful and innocent Denmark. The Nazis, who are pleased to describe themselves as protectors, succeeded in carrying out this plan of General Keitel's like clockwork. The whole country was in their hands within 24 hours. >> All right. All right, then, this is what I want to do. Without pain or discomfort, I want us to move to the very last day of your life as Helga. You'll not yet have crossed over. You don't have to feel any pain or discomfort. You can rise above the scene or situation, just to observe. But I want it to be the very last day of your life as Helga. So on the count of three, you'll be there. 1, 2, and 3. >> I'm outside. >> Outside. And so how old are you on this day? >> 10. >> All right, then. >> I'm standing. >> Standing. What happens to cause your life to end? >> It was like I'm in a camp, a concentration camp. >> Oh, OK. So how long have you been in the camp? >> Not very long. >> Let's move forward to the moment after death. So where are you in relation to your body now? Are you above it or off to the side? >> I'm floating above it. >> Floating above it. OK. Could I ask you a few questions? >> Sure. >> OK. So what happened? How did you die? >> I was shot. >> Shot. OK. How do feel about leaving that life? >> Yeah, it's kind of-- it's sad. >> Yeah. >> So brief, so short. >> Yeah. Do you know the name of this place, this camp where you ended your life? >> Dachau. >> OK. >> Dachau, factory of horrors. Mere mention one of the oldest of the Nazi prison camps. It is known that from 1941-1944, up to 30,000 people were entombed here at one time. And 30,000 were present. >> There's just so many bodies. >> Hmm. >> There's a lot of bodies. >> Yeah. >> It's very hard to move. >> It's very hard to move? >> Um-hmm. >> Hmm. OK. >> Hypnotherapy and Parkinson's, my colleague, a successful screenwriter, has Parkinson's and volunteered to see if she could learn about the source of her affliction via hypnotherapy. She was teaching a class at USC film school when we met. >> I'm very nervous because I feel like I-- >> Do me a favor. Before you say that again would you just ask that question once more, Scott? >> I forgot what the question was. >> What do you want? Or just repeat that-- what am I looking for today? >> What are you looking for in this experience here. >> Is this the mic over here? >> Yeah. >> I should just leave it. Do you want me to wear it? >> Just leave it is fine. >> OK. I'm looking for answers, because I feel like I know I know the answers already, but I feel like I feel sort of ambushed off my path, you know, with this Parkinson's. And it's like it's kicked me out of being human. And I don't feel human. And I want to get back to feeling like I know what I'm doing. >> Closed now. Eyes closed. Relaxing, releasing. Letting go. Beautiful. I've got some questions. And a lot have to do with this condition that she's been afflicted with. David, would you address these questions for us? >> Yes. >> She wants to know am I on my path? >> She's on her path in many ways. She has spiritual resources she doesn't even know she has. She's not tapped into them yet. >> How can she do that? >> By filling her heart with compassion for herself mainly. Forgive herself for things that she's done in the past. She doesn't have to live in secret anymore. She can be out loud and bold and push past smallness. That's why we presented her with this challenge of getting small, this condition. >> Tell me more. >> She needs to push past it by tuning in spiritually and realizing who she is. >> I feel like I'm being pulled away-- >> Yeah. >> --off to the right. >> As you're being pulled away off to the right there. >> I don't see any people. It's like I'm flying over the city. >> Hmm. Great. So you can kind of look and see the earth below you? >> Mm-hmm. >> Yeah. >> And I see a place with like white pillars or something. And like a very, very blue sky up against the white pillars. And there's a like a name. >> Oh, good. Tell me the name. >> It's something like "Longda." >> How does he communicate to you? >> Just welcome, like coming back, like welcome back, or welcome back. >> Welcome back. How do you feel about this soul's performance in a lifetime as Helga, Longda? What about Helga? >> Helga dark, dark. >> Helga was dark? >> The whole-- >> The whole life time? >> Life dark. >> Yeah. So why did Randol choose the lifetime as Helga, this short, dark life? >> To see the darkness. >> To see in darkness? What's the value in seeing the darkness for a soul like Randol? >> There's so much light, you forget the dark. >> What's the purpose in having challenges such as this? How does this help us develop? >> Patience and understanding. It's to learn-- it's about trust and patience. >> Can we take him to a place to cleanse him of this darkness and the doubt? >> The soul-- >> The river. >> The soul river. >> Let's go there. So do you like jump in or do you sit there? >> We will walk in together. >> Who are you with? >> The elders. >> Very good. >> The water is to forget. >> OK. >> The water is to wash clean. >> Is someone speaking to you? >> No, I'm just-- I am aware that burned my soul. That time burned my soul. >> OK. >> And I never knew the darkness could be so dark. >> Can this condition be reversed-- arrested or reversed? >> Yes. She's got to look at this as a spiritual crisis, not as a physical crisis, and not be apologetic for what she does, or what she says, or how she moves-- how she moves in the world. >> So what precipitated this illness in her? >> Secretiveness. >> So tell us once more how can she heal and overcome this condition? >> She needs to reconnect to the light, to everything that's light, and everything that's good about her and strong about her. >> Why is it that Howard's been brought to this session today? What is it that he really needs to get from this experience? >> This was part of the plan that you created. No one wrote this for you. You wrote it for yourself. It reminds me of when I came into this body. It's that "wow," [LAUGHS] the knowing. This is the flow of energy endless. This is where you came from to know. >> To know where you came from? >> Yeah, in this life and all that. >> Number four, back into the body gracefully now, gently. Now when you're ready, number five, number five, eyes open now. Back in the here and now. >> That was fun. That was like a wild ride. That was really fun. >> My friend opted to do brain surgery recommended by her doctors for her Parkinson's. It helped end her shaking, but robbed her of her ability to speak. She's in rehab trying to gain her voice back. >> And what I found interesting and what captured me was that over thousands of cases was a consistency of the reporting. It didn't matter whether a client came to me with a, you know, deep, religious belief system or a lack of belief in anything or any philosophical persuasion in between. Once we had them in deep hypnosis, they all told me the same things. >> In they REM state of hypnosis, you will hear every sound around you. And it will sound louder than it usually does. This is a state of being stoned where auditory stuff is more vivid. So you'll say, I can't be hypnotized because I'm hearing everything very acutely. That doesn't mean you're not hypnotized. It means you're in a REM state. Also you may feel that your eyelids feel scratchy and you want to open your eyes. You'll say, I'm not hypnotized. I want to open my eyes. Well you're in rapid eye movement and that makes your eyelids feel scratchy. That's why you want to open your eyes. So if your eyelids do feel scratchy, just say, oh, that's rapid eye movement. Open your eyes for a moment and close them again. The other thing is do not take this too seriously. If you say to yourself I'm going to wait until a true answer about my real past life comes in, I'm not going to take this thing whatever my head's making up, you're in trouble, because as far as I know, there is no true past life, I mean, in that sense. I'm going to ask questions. And a answer will pop into your mind. And you just go with the answer, that's all. It's coming from your right brain. Now your left brain will say-- I'll say, look at your feet, what are you wearing on your feet? And your left brain is going to see, well, boots will flash in. And you left brain said they were boots in the 1500s or was that's the 1600s? Maybe I better change it and make it slippers. And this is your left brain censoring and trying to make it correct historically. And this, of course, is a mess because what we're trying to do is just get these flashes from the right brain. So your left brain will go along on the trip and let it observe. And it can comment and say, oh, stupid you. You always think this. Or it's going to say you made it up. You can't write this down because you just made it up. And am I hypnotized? I'm not hypnotized. I can hear that person snoring next to me. Why doesn't that person stop snoring? All these things are going to go on in your mind. That's all right, because we need your left brain there to remember it. But it's the right brain kind of flashing that will begin to happen. And after this first trip, you'll begin to recognize whether your answer is coming immediately in the form of an impression or whether it's something you're thinking out logically. So those are the instructions. Do not take it seriously. We are playing at this. Do not be worried about rapid eye movement or eyes feeling scratchy. And it's perfectly all right to shift and change your posture. You do not need to lie on your back if it makes you uncomfortable. You can turn if your back starts hurting you. You're not going to lose god if you breathe out of the wrong nostril. OK? >> We get flashbacks that break through that amnesiac block in different ways with different people. I'm talking, now, about folks who have had no LBL experiences. They're just ordinary people. They don't even maybe know about our work. OK. Suddenly they're in a classroom in their dreams or in a flash and they can't figure out-- that's a strange image. Where's that coming from? >> Part Two-- Hacking the Afterlife through Mediumship. After Michael Newton passed away, he stopped by to chat with medium Jennifer Shaffer. We are in a noisy restaurant. I had not brought a camera, so I had to use a cell phone. So our question to Michael was you just showed up spontaneously at our lunch in Manhattan Beach. You're taking notes on how to make it easier to communicate from over there to here or from over here to there? >> From where I am. If you're taking notes from there as to be able to communicate better to people over there. >> All right, very good. Michael, let me ask you, why did you show up today? Did you show up to tell us that? >> It's like noetic science, but from the other side. >> OK, noetic science on the other side. All right, very good. >> Everybody can speak to other side. >> OK. >> And that no one does not not have the capabilities to do so. >> Excellent. All right. That's very good. I will quote-- can I quote you? >> And that everyone should start. They should start bringing them in closer. He showed me like both the dimensions-- of this gazillion. He showed me like both the dimensions of it being like at a dinner table where people are translucent to each other. >> Very good. >> But he wanted to mention the other, but yet you still have the energies to call people in. >> I asked if he had a formula to help people speak to their loved ones no longer here. Michael said, say their name, ask them a question I asked, but how do we know the answers are real? He said when you get a reply before you can ask the question, you'll know you have a connection. Luana Anders in "Dementia 13" directed by her friend Francis Ford Coppola. >> John, that will is no good. Your mother is still alive. We can talk her into changing it. >> We met in film school at USC. A writing instructor assigned us the same screenplay to breakdown. We were together for 20 years after meeting. >> You're rowing too hard. Let me row. >> You're concerned about me, Louise. Is it my heart? >> Luana was in over 30 feature films and 300 TV episodes. She began conducting a class from the "Flipside" to help those over there communicate via Jennifer Shaffer. >> John. John! >> Awake! >> One of her most iconic roles is playing the girlfriend of Peter Fonda in "Easy Rider." Ironically, her first boyfriend was Dennis Hopper. [MUSIC PLAYING] I was with Luana when she passed and started hearing from her via dreams and visitations starting the day before she passed. As noted in "Flipside," after she passed in 1996, she started showing up in dreams, visions, and to members of my family. I figured, if she can come here, then why can't I visit her? Her frequent visits to me from the flipside became the basis for the book and the film "Flipside-- A Tourist's Guide on How to Navigate the Afterlife." [APPLAUSE] >> And the Oscar goes to Jack's Nicholson in "As Good As It Gets." [APPLAUSE] >> Jack Nicholson has been nominated for 11 Academy Awards. This is his third win. >> And I'd like to thank-- I'd like to thank everybody here tonight for looking so good. [LAUGHTER] I'd like to dedicate this to Miles Davis, Robert Mitchum, Shorty Smith, Joe Vitrano, Ray Cramer, Rupert Crosse, JT Walsh, and Luana Anders. They're not here anymore, but they're in my heart. And I thank you very much. >> The other night just by chance, I happened to catch a psychic medium on television, John Edwards. And he took a phone call. And a woman said can you be in touch with my mother? And he looked down. And he concentrated for a while and he said, did she die of congestive heart failure? And the phone caller said, yes, she did. He thought again for a long moment. And he said toward the end of her life, did you give her a small Christmas tree? And the woman, again, said, yes, yes. And then she told the story of why she gave her mother the small Christmas tree. Now people looking at this could think, well, that must be proof that there is life after death. And then other people could look at that same thing and say this is a scam. It's impossible. It's a trick. It's an arranged phone call. It's something other than what it appears to be. I have friends that are shocked that I haven't made up my mind on what I believe, that I am still open to the possibility that there is a possibility that we are dealing with some communication here. We are the only species who know that our time as human beings will come to an end. And this impacts on our lives more than we probably realize that it does. So tonight, for the third time on this show, the most celebrated psychic medium in America, James Van Praagh-- Hi, James, nice to see you again. >> Hi, Charles. Good to see you again. >> Thank you. And we're going to chat a little while. And we have an audience here tonight. And we will take a phone call for James Van Praagh. >> Richard from Los Angeles, go ahead please. >> Hi, James. You're amazing. >> Thank you, Richard. >> But much better than a sitcom. I'm calling about my friend Luana who passed away a couple of years ago. >> Luano, this is a male? >> Luana-- L-U-A-N-A. >> Luana, Luana. OK. OK. Hold on. Well first of all, let me say, what I'm picking up is you. I'm tuning in to you very strong. And you have a lot of creative energy yourself. And you're a person who does several things at once. Now hold on. Was this girl ever talk to you about your career? >> Oh sure. >> Because she laughs a lot. And she has a great sense of humor. And I would know her by her laughter, like a certain way of laughing with this woman. All right? And she's talking to me about your career. And she's laughing with me here. She's saying you change all the time. You know? This thing and then you're one thing and then another thing. And she said he could never make up his mind. [LAUGHING] >> That's great. Well, it's true. >> You understand? And said you need to get yourself your feet on the floor. You need to get to-- you need to get yourself grounded, and steady, and focused. And she said she tried to focus with you, tried getting focus. Now did she have trouble with her weight before-- when she was alive at all? >> No, not really so much her weight, but she was thin. >> She was thin. I feel like she was over concerned about that or she was-- she thought about that a lot. OK? Was also-- she's talking to me also about going on a trip or-- I don't know what this means. With you going away on a trip and talking about this. >> OK. >> OK? >> I just recently came back from Europe. So-- >> OK. >> Is that what she's talking about? >> Well, she said she went on a trip with you. So this is what she said to me. And that's exactly how she said it. I don't know if she meant that. She said I went on a trip with him and she had a good time, a good time. She likes to dance. >> Does she? >> Yes, she does. And she talks about dancing here with you. >> Oh, great. >> She's also talking to me about you-- stop having to worry-- worrying about your hair. And she said he's been worrying about his hair lately. >> Huh. >> OK. Do you understand that? >> It's just getting grayer. >> OK, but she said he was worried about it and he wanted to do something with his hair and changed it in some way recently. >> Do you understand that? >> Yes, I do. >> OK. And she's giggling about this. She said you're going to change that. Now, there are some great photographs of-- everyone has photographs-- but she's telling me that you were very concerned about having a particular photograph after she died of you together. >> OK. Yes. >> And it gets very emotional with her. I also want to ask you, did you put this photograph on a refrigerator or was there one on the refrigerator? >> Absolutely. >> Thank you, because she gets very emotional when she talks about that. And she said she loves that. She loves that picture. And it almost describes the two of you together, your relationship, your friendship, all right? >> Hmm. >> One more thing-- she's talking about a collection of-- it sounds weird-- either shot glasses, or drinking glasses, or mugs. >> Martini glasses. >> Martini glasses. Do you collect these? >> Yes, I do. >> OK. And she's talking about that and she's laughing her head off. >> [LAUGHING] >> Can she say, James, how she passed? >> She's telling me that this happened very quickly with her passing. And I don't know, but she said it happened very fast. It's funny, but she said, I want to think of the good times, not the bad. >> Hmm. >> OK. >> So I don't know, but she's saying it was-- she's going on about it wasn't good, it wasn't good, it wasn't good. >> How is she? Where is she? >> Hold on. Let me just keep on getting more information for you, because I want-- was she killed at all? >> No. >> She wasn't killed. But I feel like for some reason she dies and she's surprised. Isn't that weird. I get that she's surprised. Hold on. OK. She's telling me to let you know and she's going on about how happy she is now. She's happier now. She didn't expect to die young. She died young. And she didn't expect that. And she said she's right behind you right now. >> [LAUGHING]. >> And when you hear-- when you feel the hairs on the back of your neck stand up, it's her. Also did she have a cat? >> Who? >> Did Luana, this girl, have a cat? >> Yes, she did. >> Uh-huh. And were you concerned about her cat if she died? >> Yes. OK. And she's saying you wanted to put it in a good place. You wanted to keep it for a little while and did something with this cat, she's telling me. >> Yes, yes, very important for her. >> OK. And she wants you to take care of her kitty. She's going on about that. >> OK. We'll go to a break and we'll be right back with James Van Praagh. >> I just want to say a couple of things first. It's interesting that how spirits communicate very differently. Like that last thing with the Martini glasses, now she just showed me glasses and drinking. And it's interesting that that's how they communicate. And also with the death condition, sometimes they don't want to go back to the memory of that, so they won't reveal it. So I just want to share that with you. >> And I want to share with you that I knew that deceased person as well, and that was very good and very accurate. >> Talking to Harry Dean Stanton. Harry Dean was a friend of Luana's, a friend of Bill Paxton, and a friend of mine. We spent a few nights playing guitar, hanging out at Dan Tana's talking about life and the afterlife. He was adamant there was none, that life ends in death. After making countless movies, from "Cool Hand Luke" to "Pretty in Pink," Harry passed away at age 91. Here's a sampling of his iconic roles. >> And Guy phrased it to realize you're nothing is wisdom, to realize you're everything is love, or pure intelligence, pure awareness. And that ultimately that can be defined in words. It's beyond words beyond. It's beyond consciousness. Ultimately, it's nothing. It's not important. And I don't say that in a negative sense. Ultimately, it's not important. It's all going to go. This is a fucking dream, man, all of it. And it's not being cynical, or nihilistic, or you can put all kind of labels on it, but it's just what is and period. I was 14 years old, I think. I was alone in my aunt's house. And I got terrified all at once. I started thinking there was nothing out there. It was oblivion. I was terrified at 14, or 13 or 14 years old. I had to get on the phone and call somebody. I think that was the beginning-- >> Why were you convinced there was no-- why-- why did you have this panic that there was-- why did you feel so panicked by this emptiness? >> There was no answer to it. It just-- it just happened. >> After Harry passed, I thought it would be fun to interview him through Jennifer. A week before his memorial service, Jennifer and I took up the topic. Well let's ask-- because we can, let's ask Luana how her friends who just showed up this past week, Harry Dean. >> Oh and don't forget Hugh, he knew Hugh. >> He named Hugh, OK. Well, let's focus on Harry Dean a little more because-- >> I know about Harry Dean. Let me find out. Let me see. He didn't accept it at first. >> OK, very good. >> Which then, your belief system-- it's whatever you believe is not wrong, it's just that's just the way. If you believe that there's nothing-- if you believe that there's nothing that is going to be there, right? Then that's your belief. He tried to quantify it the best way he can. Oh, this is a consciousness exaggeration. There was something that he tried to quantify or tried to quantify what he was seeing and it was there with medicine and the time that he was-- the time that he was leaving his body. >> So he was assuming that the medicine was creating hallucinations. That's what he thought. >> Yes. >> OK. >> Absolutely. He was trying to document it. Did he document things or was he known for that? Like wanting proof or did he study it? >> Yes. Yeah, he was-- that was his life was-- is he was almost like a philosopher in that way. People who knew him and talked to him, it was like very strong with him. >> It felt like a lot of people around his bed. So I don't know if it was etherically or his family. It felt like he was very loved. >> He was very loved. >> So love, she said. So loved. >> And so when he crossed over, she said he denied it at first or resisted at first? What was that like? >> He tried to understand it, like he does with everything. So he tried to-- again, the word "quantify" comes into mind. >> Yeah, yeah. >> He tried to assume that he was just like either stuck in his memory kind of thing. >> And so who broke through? >> She did. >> I believe that. So how did she break through? What did you do, Lu? >> Held his hand. >> Held his hand. >> Held this hand. Told him it was safe. >> Told him he was safe. >> Told him it was safe. It would be a soft landing. >> Soft landing. >> Now you and Harry Dean went on a trip together. >> Yes, they did to Santa Barbara or somewhere fun? >> They went north on a road trip. >> That's what she showed me. She showed me a car. And she showed me like a hat, like it's something with a convertible. >> Convertible. Be specific, please. So convertible, hat. >> And the care meant everything. >> The car meant everything. Whose car was it? Was it Harry's? >> No, it doesn't look-- he had part ownership. It felt like it was a studio's car, something like that. >> OK. That's possible. But there was another person in the car. I'm going to see him on Monday. >> Was it her brother? >> Like a brother? >> Like a brother, they grew up together. I feel like they went to high school, like they grew up together. >> Career together. >> Career together, same thing. >> Anything you two want me to tell Fred when I see him on Monday? >> Just hearts. She just blew like hearts and kisses. >> Hearts and kisses. OK. That's not enough for Fred. >> I know. Tell Fred he's dehydrated. There's something with his headaches. >> OK. >> He has headaches. >> He has headaches. And he needs to hydrate more. >> Right. >> Drink more water. All right. That's very good. That's something. And so when they got to Monterey, there was something going on, an event. >> There was a festival that was going on. >> What kind of a festival? >> She says free spirit festival. >> OK. >> But the festival that was going on-- she's showing me movie screens, so there was something that was going--they had to like sit. And then she's showing me screens that you take pictures in front of. They had to be a part of. And it had to do with advertising, whatever it was. >> Were there people performing? >> They just did it for fun. It felt like a-- in our day, like a bunch of bands playing, like a reggae thing. >> Yeah, yeah. >> Something like that. >> Yeah. >> But it was like the first of its kind. >> Yes. >> One of the first, like "Lollapalooza" but way back then. >> Do you remember any of the acts that you saw perform there? >> I just got shown Prince, but I don't think he was there. So I-- can't imagine. >> But somebody like Prince. >> Somebody as big as that. >> Somebody in that kind of vein of Prince. >> Yes, like Michael. >> OK. OK. But-- >> It wasn't. I know that. >> I know but Prince was a guy who played-- >> Guitar. >> OK. >> So was it Jimi Hendrix. >> Correct. >> OK. So she showed me Jimi Hendrix and that's where I got the reggae part of it. >> Now-- >> There is an afterlife. >> Is there-- oh, is that what you want me to tell Fred? >> Thank you, Luana. >> OK. That's very-- >> Fred knows it. Fred was much more mature, he says, than he was. >> All right. Can I put an exclamation point in that? >> Go easy on him. Remember the baby. Remember the baby. >> OK. The girl who had the baby that died? OK. >> Or miscarried or something along those lines. >> All right. That's OK. I don't know if I would be able to reach her, because I don't know her. >> He's showing me Google. So I don't know if there's something that can be on the internet. >> OK. All right. I'll look that up, Harry. I'll do that. Now there's a mutual friend that we have. If you look around this room, there's another person that Harry Dean knows. >> Well Bill Paxton, right? >> Thank you. >> See, well Bill showed up. So I just wanted to make sure that was him. >> OK. That's correct. And so now do you know consciously why they're together? >> Showing me like a mentor or something. >> Very good. OK. Very good. >> A mentor and I think Bill was really young or one or the other was very young. And it had to do something when they were young. >> What was it like for Harry to see Bill or Bill to see Harry? >> Oh, they had a drink. They were just-- they were like what the fuck, I can't believe this is happening. >> Very good. Well the both of you-- the both of you get the chance to sort of-- >> But which part in "Titanic--" he was part of "Titanic." Because he showed me "Titanic." >> Yeah, Bill was part of "Titanic." So Lu, talking to Harry, Harry is there one thing he wants to let us know? There is an afterlife, exclamation point. >> No. There's more than an afterlife. >> So there is an afterlife comma, there's more than an afterlife. >> There's a present life that creates an afterlife. >> What does that mean, Harry? Or is that Lu? >> He's showing me different levels. >> Yeah? >> He said because he didn't believe it, he kept on spinning. He wasted a lot of time here mentally thinking about it, because he couldn't-- he couldn't escape it. So he's like on the bottom of the treadmill on it. If you just believe, then it will take you-- why you're here, you're able to be more present versus fighting it. >> You don't know who Harry Dean is, do you? >> I have no fucking idea who he is. I thought he was a sausage. >> OK. >> Sorry. >> He's not Jimmy Dean. But Bill knows who he is and Luana knows who he is. And Luana knows-- >> Bill was very-- Bill was just like this to Harry. >> Kimberly Babcock is a medium and a minister from Ohio. She was visiting Los Angeles when I asked to meet her for the first time. Unfortunately, it was in another noisy restaurant. In the interview with Kimberly Babcock, I asked if we could speak to my old friend Bill who passed a few weeks prior. I never say his full name. She has no idea who he is, but everything she says is accurate. >> Was he unable to say goodbye before you passed? >> Yes. >> Yeah, must have been quick or no closure. That's it. I have-- I have closure. I am at peace. I am-- he knows that he didn't get to say goodbye. There's no closure. Sounds like this they still have that wound, because there was no closure before he passed. Or he must not have been able to say goodbye, like he keeps going like this, which means didn't get to say goodbye before he passed. >> Bill Paxton has died. Celebrities reacted quickly to the loss on Twitter. "Apollo 13" co-star Tom Hanks sweetly wrote, "Bill was simply a wonderful man." >> There was room on the door for Jack. >> Bill was known for starring in iconic blockbuster films including "Titanic," "Aliens," "Apollo 13," and "Twister." >> What does he look like to you? >> I actually don't see him at all. He just makes me do that with my hand. >> OK. You feel a sensation or a presence about you? >> Um-hmm. Did he have heart issues, chest? >> Yes. >> Yeah. All the energy goes into the heart and the chest to validate his presence. And he makes me feel like his passing was quick, like he didn't get to say goodbye, but he's at peace with the quickness of it. And I have closure with that. And I want they-- them to have closure. They need to have closure. >> So really, the only way we can give them closure is for you to tell them something-- >> Who? >> --that they don't know the answer to-- or we don't know the answer. Is there anything you can tell them that's new or more information? >> All I heard-- when you were kind of talking was I'm sorry. Would you know if his dad was there, if his dad was passed before he did? >> Yes, he did. >> Because I see dad like written in the air. So it's dad. >> In interviews with two other mediums, Jennifer Shaffer and Raylene Yuanez both said his father was there to greet him. When we asked Bill if that was a happy reunion, he said, yes and no, because that meant one thing-- I must have died if I'm seeing my dad. >> Interesting. >> Well, Billy, I just wanted to tell you I want to leave this door open for you. I knew I was interviewing Kim today and I thought, well, this would be a fun chance to just say hi. And you can come to wherever you need to, if you need to. >> He says he feels like he would be a smart aleck. >> He would. >> He says we always have the chance to say hi. You don't need her. That's what he's saying. >> Well, no, I know that. I'm just saying-- >> He's just smart aleck. Did he smoke? >> Probably. >> He's got like a-- it must be a cigar, because it feels bigger than a cigarette. He feels like he knows no stranger, like that kind of person. >> So what was the biggest thing you've learned in passing over? >> There is no time. There is no death, he says. And he didn't realize how much fear he had, until he died. I'll just say it verbatim. Like I'll speak as if I'm him. He says, I'll say this. I realize the fear that I carried within myself planted fear in others. And for that, I shed remorse. Meaning I know and acknowledge my remorse and I have to heal in that way. Because he's showing like the collateral damage he did. So for example-- this is what he's saying to give an example. Like we walk around, like, I'm so worried about my heart. I'm so worried about-- and other people think, oh gosh, I should be worried, too. And so it created collateral damage because we then believe in our fears and it created this collateral damage he said. He didn't realize how much he did that. He's funny. I liked his personality. He's one of those people that he's going to give you a little bit just to make you want more. When you said is there anything you want me to tell your friends, or family, or whatever, he literally said I can fly. And he's playing like (SINGING) I can fly, I can fly. You know? >> Great. >> But he's laughing, because it's almost like I know they want more but this is what I'll give them-- I can fly. >> Can you tell Kim your last name? >> Why? That's what he did. >> That's what he did. OK. I know he loves-- >> I said are you sure? And he's like checking his pockets-- nope, he says. >> Come on, Billy, come one. >> Let me tell you the conscious information that I know-- is your name with an 'e' at the end of Towne. And he just told me this today. And then I also know because he said he worked with you that you must be in the industry or you were in the industry. >> Um-hmm. >> And so that's what I do know. I don't know anything else. >> Should we'd say if our friend Hira is available? >> I don't know how you're going to do that. >> Well, this is up to Jennifer. Now Luana, Eddie, you know who Hira is. >> OK. How do you spell Hira? >> H-I-R-A. >> He wouldn't know that. I have a picture of Hira. You do? >> Oh, that would be helpful. >> You have it handy? >> That's how I look at cases. Hira, I couldn't find Hira. I'm like, Hira, where are you? I was looking for a person. Awesome. OK, give me a second. Was there something wrong with Hira's chest, that usually-- >> He had a heart attack. >> OK. So that's his chest area. Right here. OK. Luana is holding on to Hira. >> OK, Luana's-- >> Luana's holding onto her. >> Luana's holding onto Hira. >> >> Yeah. >> Him. >> She knew him. >> Well I-- she's just showing me playing with him. So-- >> So Lu, we want to talk to Hira. We want to ask him questions. >> OK. Hira's saying that you have felt him when he-- after he passed. You felt like an energy. I don't know if it was in the bed or next to you. Did you ever feel that thinking it was him? That was him. That was him. And so he's showing me like you getting startled thinking that you felt that. And he's showing me that was him. Like he comes across like a person, like somebody that you cherish. Was he-- there's something about 12. >> He died at the age of 12. >> He did. >> OK, thank you Hira, appreciate that. >> He said, that but when they show me 12, sometimes it means December so I wasn't sure. I felt like you took him everywhere. >> I did. >> You took him everywhere. He says that you were the best owner in the world. Everybody wanted to come back and be Hira. Like you put him first more than anything else or any human. >> At that time in my life, I certainly did. >> OK. >> That's a good thing to ask. >> So when you're able to, a Lotus position-- they keep showing me you in a Lotus position, just calm. And then just use your heart. That's where they're saying open your heart and just think of them. It's like a calling card. >> Those are three of the most important people in my life-- Hira, Eddie, and Lulu. >> Hira's being well taken care of. >> Since then Hira has helped speak to other animals. Hira reports, "Animals are aware of how incarnation works but humans are not." Robert had been a skeptic, but when asked his thoughts since said, "Martinus--" his nickname for me-- "when you know, you know." >> Part Three-- Hacking the Afterlife via Accessing Near Death Events. >> An incredible installment in our series She's Got Faith with the question what happens when we die? Stephanie Arnold says she knows the answer, because she was dead for 37 seconds. She flatlined while giving birth to her second child. And a glimpse of what happens after death forever changed her life. >> And the thing was is that I had had a baby before. I'd had a c-section before. So it wasn't the fear of the unknown. So I told everybody, I said not only am I going to die. I'm going to need a hysterectomy. I'm going to hemorrhage. These organs are going to combine. I'm going to be put under general anesthesia. The baby's going to be fine. And I'm going to be dead on the operating table. So I saw who hit the button for the code. I saw that my anesthesiologist was down by my feet. I saw the nurse that jumped on my chest to give me CPR. I saw what was happening down the hall with my other child in the labor and delivery room. My husband wasn't present at the time, but I saw what he was wearing when he got off the plane. I had heard my doctor say over and over again this can't be happening, this can't be happening. And I said to her later, I said, did you say that? And she said I did, but in my head. >> Are you seeing yourself translucent or are you just seeing the energetic visual? Like is it just light or is it actually you and light or a combination of the two? >> You know I don't see as much of the torso. I don't see feet. I see more of like from waist up. >> OK. >> And I see a dress, like just a long dress. So I can't tell where their-- >> What color is that dress? >> It's all white. >> OK. Can we bring Steph's guide here? It might be you, Ida. But could we bring her guide here? Is it a male, or a female, neither, or both? What comes to mind? Or a light? >> Male. >> A male. >> It's not-- >> I'm sorry, say again-- male what? >> It's not-- it's not her. She's not my guide. >> Sam, I'm going to ask you to do us a huge favor. Would you walk our friend Steph in to visit her council. >> We're standing outside, walking on a path. And there's a door in the distance, but it's a sidewalk path, like an arch. >> OK. And is there a building in the distance? The door-- attached to the door? >> The door is attached to a building, yeah. >> What does it look like? Is it white, black, green? >> It's white-- it's white, but a little gray. But there's no markings on it. >> What does it look like inside? What does it looked like? >> You know, it feels like the room is wide open. >> David Bennett is a former science officer who drowned for 12 minutes. His NDE was studied by scientists at the University of Virginia and was featured in Morgan Freeman's "Story of God." >> Just about then this falling bridge above our heads and it just came crashing down on top of us. And it folded the Zodiac in half like a peanut butter sandwich. And I was catapulted into the sea. And I'm hanging on to this old World War II Mae West life jacket. You know the big orange pillows? >> Yeah. >> And I'm hanging on to that just-- and I'm a commercial diver. I'm trained as a commercial diver, so I'm not freaking out. I'm used to being in the water. I've logged thousands of hours underwater. >> Right. >> And so I'm just holding my breath. And I have faith that this life vest is going to bring me up to the surface sometime soon. You reach a point where the oxygen deprivation creates a euphoria. And you believe you can breathe. And you just breathe in saltwater. And it's not a pleasant experience. But it's a burning. And it happens very quickly. And then, boom, you're gone. There's something in the brain that allows you to escape that severe agony. Then I saw this light appear. And it wasn't-- it was just off in the distance. And I was drawn to it, just absolutely drawn to it. And I felt like I was moving toward it. But I can't tell if it was coming toward me, I was going toward it. It just felt like movement to me. And it wasn't a tunnel or anything like that. It was just light. And as I got closer, and closer, and closer, it grew. It grew and, you know, and it was infinite. And as I got closer, it looked like millions upon millions of fragments of light. And they were all moving, and dancing, and coalescing together and stuff like that. >> Is there anything in nature that would fit the description? >> Actually, yeah, have you ever seen a school of like sardines or anchovies, how they work together? And sometimes when they're near the surface, they'll move in unison to the light. And they'll refract the light multiple colors and things like that just, you know? Well, that's kind of like what the fragments appeared to me. They were of a like mind moving in unison and coming together, and separating, and coming together, and doing-- it was beautiful. And I was in awe. I was in absolute gaga awe of this light. And I-- and I kept-- I was coming closer and closer. >> It's kind of stacked. OK. Let's go to the-- let's go to the first row of that stacked group. How many people are in the first row? >> Six. >> Six. Very good. How are they arrayed? Are they in a line? Are they sitting or standing? Are they in a circle, a semicircle, or what? >> They're in a line. >> OK. Priscilla, thank you for allowing us to chat with you. We appreciate it. First question of the day, how is our friend Steph doing? >> She's going to be fine. >> She's going to be fine. So that's a little different than what our pal Sam said, isn't it? Or what Ida said, struggling. >> Uh-hmm. >> So Priscilla, would you put that in our friend's mind? That not only is she doing OK, but she's doing pretty good, isn't she? >> Yes. >> She's on the path she's supposed to be on. Am I-- correct me if I'm wrong. >> Yes, she is. >> By the way Priscilla, have you heard of me? >> Yes. >> How so and put that in Steph's mind? >> Ah, through a dog. >> So I'm the annoying guy who goes around and ask questions. So through a dog. I love that! So which dog? >> I see like-- it looks like a German shepherd, but it's-- >> Oh my gosh, is it is it through my dog, Sam? How do you know Sam, Priscilla? Or do you? >> I don't know. >> But don't judge it. >> Yeah, I don't-- I just see her playing fetch with him. >> OK. Very good. Let's not judge it. That's hilarious. I love it. Priscilla, let me ask you a direct question. Is this my dog Sam or is this some other German shepherd? >> That's how we know each other is through the dog. >> OK. Great. And is it my dog though? The dog that I know is Sam? OK, very good. >> I believe it is. >> OK. Well she can tell you no, or maybe, or yes. What does she say? Thumbs up. >> She's smiling. >> She's saying that you don't want to believe, but I'm telling you. >> Oh, I totally-- I totally-- I talked to Sam for the first time about a month ago. So I totally get what she's saying. >> And then three fragments broke away and they came. And they-- >> Three out of-- >> Infinite. >> Infinite. Out of infinite. >> Billions and trillions. >> Yeah. And they came toward me and they conveyed this welcome home. And one thing I forgot to say was as I was getting closer to this light, I just kept feeling these waves of love that felt like it was embracing me in this warm blanket. And I was so comfortable with this love. Just it just was such a warm embrace that when these three-- and I talk to them as light beings, because they were fragments of light that were heading toward me and welcoming me home. And it's still tough to talk about. It's been over 30 years and I'm still getting choked up because it was a feeling of home like I've never, ever felt before. >> Here's an example of hacking the afterlife by asking questions about a vivid dream. I was invited by Susan Pinsky to her podcast where I suggested an experiment with her husband Dr. Drew. And so you mentioned earlier that there was a-- I think it was a disconcerting memory? >> Yeah, I had what I thought was a horrible dream when I was very young, like under two, under three. He had where your irises are and your pupils, he had red crosses. >> OK. Very cool. >> Oh. >> All right. >> Ooh, right? >> In life or in this memory? >> In this memory. I really don't-- I'm just free associating as you suggested. >> Whose home is this? Is this the Burgermeister's? >> Yes. >> OK. Do me a favor Burgermeister, put into Drew's mind your last name. >> Schmitz. >> OK, thank you. And what year? Just pop a year-- >> 1900? Literally 1900 or 1890 or-- >> Right in right there. >> Whoever is Drew's spirit guide, join this little crowd that we're talking to here-- the light. It's a-- thank you. OK. So can I ask this light to come forward or you get closer to it? >> Sure. >> OK. >> And then eventually about a dozen of these fragments of lights were there greeting me. And we started to-- there was no conveyance of come on, let's go, we got to do something. It was more of just an understanding we've got to go over here. And we went to this area that was very-- to me it felt spherical. And we started to reexperience my life. And we experienced it in such a way, it wasn't just me experiencing it. They were experiencing it as well. And they were very excited. >> All 12? >> All 12. We were all experiencing my life. And not just from my point of view, but from every interaction I'd ever had from the people that I'd interacted with. I got to see my interactions and how I hurt other people and things like that. But I also got to see that when I did open up, and I did have experiences of just being open-hearted and giving freely of my love and my heart how that created some of the biggest ripples. The things that I took so much pride in, like becoming the chief engineer of Aloha and things like that, didn't have such big ripples. What really had the bigger ripples was when I would help someone without any look for reward or anything. And I got to really experience it in this life review and see how that planted a seed in my being that when we do things for each other, that we're expanding our connections. We're expanding that positive energy, that sort of thing, you know? And I didn't know that through most of my life, because I had a lot of suffering and stuff, until I experienced this where I did it myself, of my own free will, open-hearted without any look for reward or anything like that. I got to experience this woman's joy. Well I had one of those-- I call it deja vu on steroids-- type of moments where I experienced part of that future life review in the hospital when the doctor came in and was telling me you've got cancer. Only he didn't use the C word. You have tumors that have done this, and this, and this. And so they were explaining it to me. When he was doing it, it was like I knew before he walked in the door this-- because I'd never met this-- he was an intern at the hospital that I never knew. He came in. And I recognized him immediately. And I recognized the surroundings, everything around me. And I knew exactly what he was going to say. And I sat there. I let him squirm a little bit, because he was-- because I was an assistant director there at the hospital. So I mean I was well known and stuff. And here's this new intern about to give me the death sentence, right? And he's hemming and hawing. And I'm sitting there thinking, I remember this moment from my life review. And I know exactly what he's going to say. And I know I'm going to regret it in my next life review, but I'm going to let him squirm a little bit. [LAUGHS] Because it really didn't bother me that he was going to say that. Because I saw that I was going to have cancer, but, like you said, I also saw I was going to live beyond it. So there was a certainty that this was just a part of that purpose. And this was something that I had to experience. I had to go through the cancer so that I could experience the suffering, so I could experience the pain, so that I could experience all of that. And they told me they weren't going to treat it, all that stuff. And I said, no, we are going to treat it, because I'm going to survive this. And they all immediately thought-- you know Elizabeth Kubler Ross, and-- they all thought I was in denial, the first stage of grief, right? But I had already gone right to acceptance, because I accepted that, yeah, this is just a stage, something that I have to go through. This is one of my challenges, one of my purposes in life. And that if I follow my guidance, I'm going to survive this without a doubt. And so I was very certain right from day one. Everybody else in my life was certain I was dying, but I was certain I was living and this was an opportunity to live life and experience life and to squeeze all the juice out of life. >> Now do me a favor. And this energy that's right in front of you, put your hand inside of it-- your imaginary hand, just slip it right into this energy. What does that feel like? >> Peace. >> All right, very good. Thank you. Warmth and peace. All right. So I'm going to ask this light, if the light could transform into an entity so that we can have a conversation. Male or female? >> I guess male? >> I want you to take Drew by the hand. And I want you to walk him into his council. >> Council? >> Drew does not know what I'm talking about, but, Mort, you know what I'm talking about. >> Huh. >> So would you do me a favor, walk him towards his council. Are we inside or outside? Are we in a room, are we ou-- >> In a room. >> We're in a room. OK, very good. And now are they-- how are they arrayed? How many people are there in this room? >> I can't really tell. >> But roughly from-- >> 12. Thank you. >> I'm having trouble seeing individuals. >> That's OK. Are they-- just what's your impression? >> Impression like Native Americans are here. >> Very good. Are they all male? Are they female? Are they a combo? >> Mix. >> All right. Let's go to the-- >> Mostly male. >> --first person on the far left. What's this person look like? >> Like a female pilgrim. >> Very good. And I want you to go up close to her. >> OK. >> She's one of the only women in there. >> Let's give her a name. Let's ask-- >> Marie. >> Marie, thank you. And how is she dressed? >> [LAUGHS]. Like a-- >> Like a pilgrim? Brown. I'm just saying what colors. >> Like dark with a white apron and with those bonnets that they would-- >> Very good. I understand. And Marie-- >> I love this. >> Marie is her name. Correct? >> Something like that. >> OK. Marie, I want you to put into Drew's mind how you earned your position on the council. >> She brings history. >> Thank you. History. All right. And Hence the pilgrim outfit, we like that's. It's very clever. And now I want you to describe the emotion or the feeling you're getting from holding this person's hand. >> Kindness. >> Kindness. What kind of kindness? I mean it's a simple word, is it is it overwhelming kindness. >> No. It's gentle, wise, deliberative. >> Let me ask Marie, how do you feel what we're doing? Do you think this is weird? >> She-- everyone thinks it's weird in this room. >> OK, very good. [LAUGHING] I appreciate that. >> And outside. >> No, I don't think-- I don't think it's weird. >> No, no. She's-- we're talking about the council. They think it's weird. I think I'm hypnotized, myself. >> Marie, I want you to ask-- I want you to say something to Drew. I want you to give him a sentence-- and to the people listening in-- I want you to give him a-- >> Wisdom is wealth. >> Thank you. Thank you very much. Wisdom is wealth. Drew, is this something you've heard before? >> No. >> OK, thank you. So Marie, this is coming from Marie. I would call this new information. Let's move to the next person to Marie. Is it a male or a female? >> I'm having trouble because I have this presence of like a North American Indian. And that feels-- it feels like-- >> Don't judge it. >> Yeah, I'm feeling-- I'm judging it. >> Please don't. >> I'm judging it. >> All right, so very good. >> So describe what he's wearing. >> Headdress. >> How many feathers? >> Lots. >> How many? 10? >> 90? Are they up? Are they down? >> All the way down his back. Up and then down his back. >> Up and then down. OK. And I want you to look carefully at his face. >> Yeah. >> Look at those eyes. >> Hmm. >> What's the emotion you get looking at him? >> Depth, depth. >> Depth? All right. Is he wearing any symbols, or emblems, or jewelry? >> Beads. >> Beads. >> OK. >> This one is like making me emotional. This guy. >> Very good. Very good. I understand. >> And that's why I'm having trouble staying with his eyes. >> That's OK. You don't have to. Just look at his beads for a second. >> Hmm. >> Just focus on those beads. And please, if he can give us a name or the tribe that he represents? >> Humanity. >> Humanity. >> Is there a tribe that's called itself "humanity?" >> Yes, yes. There is. Well the Sioux considered everybody in their tribe to be "humanity" and everybody who was not in the Sioux was not "humanity." Let me ask him directly. Are you Sioux? Could I characterize you as Sioux? >> You could characterize it that way? >> Thank you. Are you Lakota, or Dakota, or Nakota? Which one. >> Nakota. >> You have been watching over him for so many lifetimes. Do you feel like he's doing a good job? >> He will. >> He will. >> And would you show him why he's doing the kind of work he's doing where he's saving lives on a daily basis? >> He's waving a spear over me. >> Very good. OK. And is that spear a warrior spear or is-- >> It's more-- more ceremonial. It feels like a blessing, some power being transmitted or something. >> OK. Well what does that feel like? >> I don't know. It's all very confusing. >> Is he transmitting it to you? Do you have a feeling of it? >> Yes. What is that feeling that he's trying to impart from you with his great knowledge of humanity? >> Patience and work to be done. >> Dr. Drew remains a skeptic. After this experiment, he said he felt hypnotized. He asked, how else could I be seeing people I've never seen before? I pointed out his answers were identical to dozens of others. Josh Davidow is a filmmaker. We met in Tibet while I was filming "Journey into Tibet" with Robert Thurman. >> Here's my consciousness. And then and I was just kind of like where am I? What's going on? What's the story, because I was so used to hearing that voice. >> Yeah. >> And then I looked down. And that was probably the next thing I saw. So the first thing I saw was the landscape and the amazing scape up at the top from there. But then I looked down and saw my body. And what I immediately remember thinking is seeing your dead body and immediately going into habituated thought of going, Jesus, that's bad. But the second I did that, there was another part of me that went, hang on a minute, that's not bad. It's not anything, it just is. That's your body. I'm still me. And I hear my voice. And I'm cracking wise in my head, but I don't have that body. What else don't I have? And then I start going through this checklist. And I don't have guilt. And I don't have shame. And I don't have pain. And I don't have history. And I don't have all of these things that I really owned as a physical body. >> Let's go visit your council. Are we inside or outside? >> We're inside. >> OK. Describe it to me. What's the structure? >> It's like a-- sort of like a court room but a built out of white pearl. >> How many people are in the room? When you look around, how many counselors are here? >> Six. >> Six. All right, very good? And are they in a row or are they in a semicircle? >> They're in a semicircle. >> Semicircle. >> OK. Let's go to the first person on the left. >> OK. He kind of seems alien. He's got like three sort of fingers. It almost looks like a claw, but it's very benign looking. They're normal-size eyes, but they're all pupil. They're all black. It doesn't look like clothes. It looks like-- it looks like the same skin that's on his hand, which is like a putty. >> What's one word that you could use to represent how you earned a spot on Josh's council? What's a word that you represent in Josh's spiritual evolvement? >> He said discipline. >> Have you normally incarnated on a planet in our universe or in another universe? >> Another universe. >> Another universe. >> OK. Is there anybody in Josh's life who has had lifetimes on your planet? >> He says yes. >> Has Josh had a lifetime on your planet? >> Yes. >> I want you to put that lifetime in Josh's mind. Are we inside or outside? >> Inside. >> You're inside. OK. Are we in a building, or a structure, or where are we? >> We're in a building. It seems like a very mechanical-- it almost looks like a fertility clinic. >> Almost looks like-- I've never been in one, but you have. >> No, I haven't. >> All right. Very good. >> Actually, I haven't. >> What is this place, Sith? Is this a fertility clinic? Is this where Josh works or what's he doing there? Well, first, let me ask you-- we're inside. What does Josh look like in this lifetime? If you could just show it to him without any stress or weirdness. >> Well, he kind of looks like Sith. >> Is Josh's role on this planet, is it science? Is it some kind of a doctor? >> Yes. >> It is some kind of a doctor. And it has to do with fertility, doesn't it? >> Yes, yes, yes. >> Something to do with it, because that's what you put in his mind. >> Yeah. >> So some kind of a doctor involving-- are you guys having a difficulty with fertility on your planet? >> No. >> It's just the process. >> It's just the proce-- yeah, it's making-- it's designing a good future. >> So you're telling me he's not consciously aware of having an event where some aliens came and talked to him or something like that. >> No, he's not. >> But you're showing it to him now. >> Yeah. >> How does the information get passed from Josh to you guys? Is it etherically, electrically, energetically? I mean how is the information that you're seeking happen? >> We experience it. We experience it while he sleeps. >> OK, very good. So it's like you come by, and it's like you scan him in a way. And you get the information. And that information, what's the value of that information for your folks back home? >> To make better people. >> And by making better people, you're not talking about making-- do you mean-- you talking about making better people on your planet? >> No. >> What do you mean? >> Making better people on Earth. >> You're helping and-- correct me if I'm wrong, Sith-- you're helping alter the consciousness of the planet. Is that correct. >> Yes. >> So let me ask you, Monty, are you familiar with what I've been doing asking councils and councilors information about their charges? >> Yes. >> What do you guys think about this? Is this unusual for you? >> They think you're on the right path. >> What word do you represent on Josh's council? >> Peace? >> Did he earn that from having a difficult lifetime? >> He earned it. >> Does Josh want to see where he earned it, or is that stressful? >> No, he can see if he wants. >> All right. So let's examine it. Where are we? Are we inside or outside? >> We're inside a cockpit of a plane. It looks like World War II, I think. >> OK. Very good. Take a look at his uniform. >> He's American. >> What's his name? >> Major Tom DeLuca? >> OK. >> Louise, something. >> Louise or DeLuca, something Italian? >> Something Italian. >> What kind of plane were you in? >> A bomber. >> A bomber. OK. So other guys we went down with you. >> Hmm. >> All right. What was the name of your bomber. Do you remember? >> Lady-- Lady Belle? >> Lady Belle? OK. A different plane, but Lady Belle. >> It's a lady. >> OK. >> What did you learn from that lifetime? >> Not to die in fear. >> Jennifer Shaffer, Medium. We've been having chats with the flipside for over six years. In this one, I decided to ask someone I'd met before if he wanted to chat. >> Merv, show Jennifer where you met me. >> On his show? >> Yeah, very good. >> He had a show, too? >> He did have a show. >> I know Johnny Carson did. I didn't know Merv did. >> Don't judge it. It's more fun when you don't judge it. [LAUGHS] It's more fun for me. So Merv, yeah, I was on your show. OK? Do you remember-- Merv, do you remember what I was doing on your show and who brought me on your show? [MUSIC AND APPLAUSE] >> He walks out the door and says, Merv, like I-- 17 years, I've been here. Now, of course, he doesn't have to television set. >> The first thing to notice about Richard-- >> Is he has Hollywood sunglasses-- it's in his top pocket. >> Richard-- Richard is an aura person. By that I mean if we were sitting here talking and the camera takes a shot of Richard, the whole show is better because Richard is here. Just get a sh-- can you get a close up of Richard? Now look at that. Don't you all feel a little better now that he's here? [LAUGHING] Right away. That's mainly what he does. >> Do you really? >> Yeah. >> Well to tell you the truth-- now you were talking, you were saying earlier-- >> Do you want to move into the main chair? >> Yeah, I think I'm ready. Oh, yeah, forget that. Now you were saying earlier about that stuff about him, he always has to apologize about the friendly stuff when he comes out here. >> See, I'm only used to sitting next to stars. >> Bear with us. >> But anyway, no. I have a story to tell about friendly-- my one friendly story. >> See I got stuck with for 90 minutes. >> See, this is my first time for me. The friendly story is I was in a restaurant in Hollywood. And I was sitting not too far from a megastar, a really famous Hollywood personality. >> Wow. >> And as this person was walking out of the restaurant, a man stopped him and said, Oh, I know you, you're on television. Wait, come over to my table. And he had like seven daughters with him. And the person, this megastar, went over to the table, and very politely shook his hand, signed an autograph, kissed a couple of the girls. >> Sweet. >> Do you know who that star was? >> No. >> It was you. >> Oh. >> It was right after Chuck was on the show. >> Right after we did the friendly show. And we know what you were like before the-- >> Even you. >> I did that at Musso and Franks? >> Musso and Frank's. >> But see, he came on and told me that whole friendly stuff for 90 minutes here, about, oh, you've got to be friendly. But I've been that way all my life. >> It's infectious. >> You know, so I got bored with him. >> Why are you leaning so close to my friend. >> Because I like Richard better than I like you. >> It really happened. That's I mean. Go ahead, continue. >> He's got an aura about him. What a wonderful guy. >> You were making everybody laugh-- >> OK. >> --about meeting someone. >> OK, very good. I did. I made everybody laugh about meeting, you Merv. >> Oh, OK. >> That was the punch line, because I met you. I was at Musso and Frank's. I saw you signing autographs. And I thought to myself, look at that, Merv will go stop at any table and sign autographs for anybody. I mean he's really a polite guy. All right. So Merv, why all the shows, buddy? >> He could recognize talent even when they couldn't. Tell me the guy that passed away that you did-- that was in your movie that did the naked-- naked dating. >> Oh, Howard Schultz. >> Howard Schultz. >> So what kind of things are you working on or talking about? Are they story points? Like you grow up in Wisconsin and I'll grow up in Iowa, and we'll meet up somewhere along the path? >> Yeah. >> So like that, like story beats. Does anybody advise you on the story beats or you guys just work it out yourselves? >> They're laughing. They have hundreds-- like there's like thousands of people behind them. >> Thousands of people who have to-- do they have to agree on the process? I'm aware that there's free will. So people can say-- >> Merv, are you doing this with a lot of people or is Howard just one of the people. >> They both want it. They both think that they're more powerful together. >> OK. And what kind of topics are you guys going to work on. >> They're going to do shows that have humor, because they think that's great medicine. >> I see. So almost like build a network together. >> Ding, ding, ding, ding. >> All right. So Merv, we'll be right back. [LAUGHS] That's what he used to say. I would like to speak to-- if it's possible-- can we speak to her main council, the main council of the people who advise Kimberly in her lifetimes? >> She says, yes, and she pushes through like it's the feeling of four, like four. >> Four. Very good, thank you. And so going from left to right, if you could describe the first person on your left. >> [LAUGHING] Go figure. Well, if there was ever a being that looks like ET, I'm like, of course, it's you because I've seen this one before, only one time before. >> Very good. >> Can we speak to you, sir, ma'am? >> Yeah, he told me his name. His name is Sebastian. He has like gray skin, no raised ears. He looks like an ET. >> But he's got two arms. Is that correct? >> Yes. But just a little out of proportion to human. >> Yeah. And his eyes are big or small. >> They're big, but his face is very flat. So like how we have the difference in space from our nose to here dips down, he doesn't have that. >> OK. And Sebastian, can Kimberly take a hold of your hand and hold your hand for a second? What does that feel like? What's the emotion you get from that emotional feeling? >> Safe. Definitely emotional and definitely safe, very, very, very, very safe. >> Safe. OK. That was kind of-- >> Comforted and loved. >> Well, Sebastian, define love. She's feeling love from you. What does that mean? >> He shows me the word everything. >> That idea that love is everything. Are you referring to consciousness and how consciousness is in everything and that consciousness is love? I'm just curious. >> Yeah. He's showing everything and the plan of everything is love. Yeah. And he's showing like this spiral. It almost looks like a stretched out slinky from space to Earth, like the cosmos to Earth, where everything is the translation of love. And the harmony that it projects, and creates, and shares is the level of like-- what is this word-- integration-- >> Great. >> --of love. >> Is Kimberly ever incarnated on your planet or where you normally have incarnated? >> He says, yes. She is now. >> Oh. And if you could allow her-- can we see that for a second? Where is this planet that you normally incarnate, is it in our universe or is it in another universe? >> It's not in our universe. >> OK. So we don't have to get down to or Cygnus 5, or Pleiades, or something. And if you going to show Kimberly just for a glimpse, what does it look like on the surface of that planet where she is concurrently. Is that what you're saying? She has a lifetime concurrently to this one. And without getting into the mass, just show her what does it look like. >> So I'm literally like standing here looking down. And it's like-- Rich, do you remember the movie "Avatar?" And do you know how there's pieces of Earth-like objects almost kind of floating around with each other? And they're kind of like from one-- it's similar to that, but it's like I'm looking down. But when I look down, I can see like cosmos below. But I also have an understanding of like over here to the right, it looks green and lush, but it's also not solid. It's-- >> Almost like a mental construct? And you created it, almost mathematical? >> Right. >> Beautiful. Is he wearing anything jewelry wise or is he just-- you're just seeing skin, this gray skin? >> Just skin. And he's cold and kind of clammy to the touch. It's not jewelry, it's like his skin. But it's almost like how a tree has rings for how old it is. >> Sebastian, are those rings around your neck related to age or what are they related to? >> Evolutionary he says. >> Evolutionary. And just to give our listeners an idea of how old you are in Earth years. >> Ah. his energy like shifts. And he gets-- he's so intense. And his voice got really deep. And he said eons, like eons. I don't know if these rings represent lifetimes as much as they represent like epiphany that caused expansion. >> Beautiful. >> Does that make sense? >> Epiphany that cause expansion. Like consciousness adjustments, like judging time over the fact that you've adjusted consciousness. So you're an important dude. Sebastian, how many councils do you work on? Do you just work with Kimberly or do you work with many people? >> Many. So the person to his left-- this is interesting, because I've never seen her before, her face. >> OK. >> She has dark hair. She looks like a Native American Indian. >> May I ask-- may I ask you. Well, I forgot to ask Sebastian. Are you aware of this work I'm doing, talking to councils? >> All the time, he says. >> OK, thank you. >> What's your what's your opinion of it? >> He's doing this. >> It means thank you in sign language. >> Yeah, that's what he was just telling me. Like he was literally saying that when you said that. Thank you-- >> Wow. >> --like in sign language. >> OK, mind blown. Mind blowing. All right. So this woman, let's ask her for a name, if you don't mind. >> I cannot believe I'm hearing this like. She's almost, like, why? Why would you be mind blown? Awashonks? >> Awashonks. >> Awashonks. >> Awashonks, thank you. >> This is so crazy. She's very fierce in her energy. She's very direct and very fierce. >> Very good. So may I ask you some direct questions, Miss A? >> Of course. >> What do you represent in Kimberly's journey, just as a word or a concept? >> Whatever that means. Alignment maybe? >> Focus. Have you lived a lifetime on the planet Earth? So you have and this is-- >> And then I'm sure you can imagine what she's showing me. She's saying I'm not afraid to kill to get to where I need to be. Now, when it comes to kill, it's not like she's on a mission to kill. It's like it's more of like prioritizing, like letting things die to prioritize what needs to live. >> And are you familiar with this work that I'm doing talking to councils? >> She says, I am. And then she follows that up with I am a part of it. >> Oh, very good. Well, let me ask you about that. Did you put Kimberly and me together today? Is that what happened? >> She takes full-- like she takes big responsibility. Like she sits back and gets really big and has this energy of taking responsibility. >> What would you like to tell people that are listening in, or hearing this for the first time, or accessing this? What would you like as a message? >> Simultaneous transaction. She's saying talk to the land and also let the land talk to you. And it's almost like a plea, like let the land talk to you. And then it's like you won't lose your way. She's showing like clarity. You won't lose your way. >> I get it, but I don't know who his is. He's like that Microsoft guy. >> Bingo. >> Correct? >> Correct. >> He's showing me, but I didn't get it. So when I don't get things, it's-- >> That's all right. You don't know his name. I'm going to tell you his name. First name is Paul. >> Paul. Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul. I know you're talking about his name. >> OK. Let me just tell you, it's OK. >> He owned a football team, a basketball team or a football team? >> Very good. He did. He owned both. >> Both. >> So who was there to greet you when you crossed over? >> I just got a big football player. >> Really, interesting. >> I don't know. Let me just go with it. >> Just go with it? >> White or Black? >> Black, African-American. >> African-American. Somebody we might know? >> Kind of like Polynesian. Maybe I'm seeing Black, but it might be Polynesian. I feel that he didn't play for him, but he tried to help him. He wanted him to play, but he died before he could play for him. >> Paul wanted to help him. >> Yes. >> But he passed away before he-- >> Before he could help him. >> Right. >> Did he went to help him with his illness? Did he have a brain problem? >> That's what it feels like, but I don't know if it's concussions. I don't know. >> Yeah, that's what it is. OK. That would be what it was. Now that you're on the flipside-- >> He was who started, it feels like. >> Speak up. >> This guy was the start of it. >> Oh, very good. >> Like he was the one that-- >> Inspired him-- >> He was so heartbroken over it. >> OK. Was it-- >> Here he owns a sports team and he feels like they're hurt-- like >> Yeah, yeah, yeah. I understand. They're hurting good athletes. >> He's trying to create helmets that were even stronger. >> Very good. >> Let's focus on the Archangel Raphael for a second, if we can. >> Can we? >> Of course. >> In terms of angels and speaking to angels or speaking to people who self-identify as angels. I've often heard that it's really in reference to the ability to move at the speed of thought, that they're so fast. And so the idea of wings is more of a metaphor than it is like, oh, I'm stuck with these things on my back. It's a metaphor for how-- so is that accurate, Raphael. >> Yeah, absolutely. And that makes sense as to why he's saying and showing-- >> Propulsion. Yeah. >> --propulsion. >> Moving from realm to realm. I've also heard the term "guardian." >> Because he was showing-- do you remember when we were talking to Sebastian, the ET that was showing those rings almost like in his aura. So Raphael's referencing that. When we were talking about propulsion, like having those-- so think about it like this, just to try to put context to. Think about those rings of like evolution or awakened consciousness, like a quantum leap of growth. And there's an imprint that's there that's always accessible. So that's why-- so it's like they're the same. It's like he's trying to say that they're the same because an archangel has those also. And that's why the fast propulsion, like the capacity to switch change quickly. Because those are like access points, he's saying. >> OK. >> Those rings are like access points to the whole reality. Whatever access point he's at, he has access to the whole realm of it, like anything happening on that channel. >> Ah, OK. That's huge. That's pretty big. >> Like a portal almost. >> In terms of us understanding what an archangel is, certainly since humanity has been around, or for a long time, people have identified archangels like seven of them or a certain particular number. Is that accurate or are there many, many more than seven? >> He's saying many, many, many more. >> If I refer to the Archangel Michael, do you think, oh, that's my buddy Michael or is that-- how does that work? >> Not like you do in your frame of reference, he says. When you say "Archangel Michael," for him, he connects more to a cause, like cause and effect. So it's like I see literally like a shift. When I say how do you connect to Michael, I see a shift and then awareness in like compassion, heart, protection. Whatever the cause, is it's a shift into that. I'm like so-- I don't know why he keeps repeating the word "exodus." It is so fascinating because that's sort of how he was answering your question when you were saying, when I mention "Michael," how do you connect to your buddy Michael? He's saying like "exodus." So it's almost like exodus is the bridge to get to compassion. Because like we would say "Michael." We would use a name identity. But they use like an intent identity. >> Is it a vibrational identity or intent? >> Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like intent. >> But exodus would be movement from one place to the next. >> Yeah. That's what he's showing, like a shift. >> Like a shift. So all right, here's a question people on the planet might want to know. Are we going through an exodus right now? >> He's like you better believe it. >> [LAUGHING] Is it a speeded up exodus, or is people's awareness becoming part of that exodus, or is it just something that's happening? I mean are we responsible for it or are you guys responsible for it? Collective, mutual. >> Mutual. >> So he's saying it's like the effect of slowing it down speeds it up. It's like in order to manifest the construct of anything that serves, you have to remove what doesn't serve. So you have to have that holy destruction. And so keeping it sacred and seeing it-- because if you keep it sacred, you don't judge it. Maintaining spaciousness is vital for survival, he's saying. Because you have-- >> Maintain spaciousness, did you say? Maintain spaciousness? OK. >> Yeah, he's saying it's like it's vital. It's vital for survival. Otherwise it's like eating yourself sick. It's like eating so much food, you have no more space to put the food, but you just keep eating until you die. But if you don't have space to put the food, if you don't maintain spaciousness, we're just constantly taking in, taking in. But if we're not expanding, if we're not present to what we're taking in, we're not expanding, we don't have spaciousness. We're not recycling. >> What's your opinion of what we're doing here? >> In what-- >> In terms of chatting with you on the flipside and showing people that you can chat to your guides, and teachers, and council members any time they want to. Is that a good thing? >> OK. Yes, like there's such a push behind-- when you say, "Is that a good thing?" There's such a push behind like punctuate the yes as big as you can. That's what he's expressing. >> Very good. All right. >> Because that in itself is the-- he says that in itself is the display of spaciousness. >> I've seen how all those diseases can affect people and felt that. So to be able to do anything that accelerates a treatment of diseases like that would be a fantastic thing. This next research is trying to fundamentally understand how the brain works. And if you understood how the brain worked better, that would help you treat different kinds of personality disorder, all sorts of different other diseases associated with the brain. >> When Paul Allen passed, we asked who was there to greet him-- Dave Duerson and Junior Seau. They wanted to thank him for his Brain Institute. I reached out to Junior's widow as an experiment to see if Jennifer could connect to her husband Junior without knowing she was his widow. >> He was, like, I almost made it to the finish line. Thank you. He said he went and saw people privately, like doctors, or did he go see people for his mind? I just felt like whatever he was taking made it worse. >> Yeah, that's true. >> OK. >> Lots of Ambien. Lots of Ambien. >> He covered everything. >> Junior would you show-- >> He had people covering things. >> Junior, would you show Jennifer how you showed up in our research, if you don't mind. And it has to do with your brain. >> Show me again? Oh, wrestling-- or not wrestling. The-- what was it called? He just showed me the guy that-- not Microsoft, but what was it, right? He showed me that guy. And he showed me like their research that they were doing. >> Correct. >> Because they know that-- for concussions. And that that's what caused all of this. And that everything because I'm looking for stuff-- I'm looking fucking everywhere. And he's like just relax. I'm still a control freak. >> Somebody-- the Microsoft guy-- we were talking to him. And we were talking to him about who greeted him on the other side. >> Oh, it was him! >> Yeah, it was him. >> Oh my god. Oh my god. >> Dave Duerson and Junior Seau came by three times to insist we tell people that Joe Namath has cured his CTE by using hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Hacking the afterlife as a methodology may one day help find cures for illness or climate change from those no longer on the planet. It's worth exploring the possibility. >> Number nine. And when you're ready, number 10, eyes open, wide awake. Wide awake now. Number 10, wide awake. >> So when are you guys you going to start, because I've got to turn the camera on. >> [LAUGHS] Very funny. You know what the most interesting thing was the inability to speak at times. I could tell it was difficult to shake off what it actually did to the soul. >> Yeah? >> Like it's like-- >> The quote you said was "It actually burned my soul." >> Yeah, I said it. That's how it felt. >> Yeah. >> It literally felt like-- >> Like it scorched. >> Like, yeah, literally like I had burned inside. >> Howard passed away on New Year's Eve 2014. He was sitting on the beach in Hawaii at dawn reflecting on his 61 years of a life well lived. He's come often to speak through Jennifer Shaffer. She said at his memorial, he was there, Rich, standing behind you enjoying the show. >> So what was interesting when that just happened, when I saw Prince, then I saw a picture of Prince and somebody took it off of a clipboard. And it was your buddy Schultz, Howard. >> OK, Howard. >> I think it's about his wife-- hold on. Were you married? 20 years. >> So Howard, can we ask you some questions? Can we ask you some questions about what's going on? What is it like for you to communicate with us? Like Jennifer and I are sitting here in her office-- >> Fun. He says fun. He's showing me that it is a vibration. It's like everybody comes in certain colors, vibrations, you name it. It's all frequencies. >> All frequencies. >> So everything vibrates at a different level, whether it's the ocean and mountains. And so you can take that frequency and create your own space. >> So where do you hang out, Howard? Have you created a home? >> Maui. >> In Maui. So it feels like Maui? >> Well, I said Maui. He just showed me playing golf. >> But how much of the course do you create? Do you create just one hole or what's in your view or do you create all-- >> He collaborates. He creates an awareness with the frequency. That if people love that, they'll come in. >> What's your handicap? >> 70? >> [LAUGHS]. OK. Very good. The most I know-- >> If I'm getting this right-- again, it's interpretation. But he's shown me a grid. So if you had a 3D model of what you wanted, he's creating something that is so spectacular so other people come. Like he's able to do it. He's getting information from everyone. He's taking information from all of the golf courses and building his own with help from people that know how to build. >> So Howard, so is there anybody that we mutually know that you hang out with or anybody you want me-- >> Luana. >> Luana? OK, very good. Did you ever meet Luana? I don't know. I don't think so. >> No. >> But you know her there. Tell me-- >> Yes, because they both visit you. >> Well she was a Buddhist who had trained in the Japanese school of Buddhism, SGI, it's called-- Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. So she's very focused on that. >> Best thing, she said. The best thing she ever did. >> Very good. It saved her life, I'm sure. She told me that a few times. >> And meaning you. Yeah. >> And what? >> Meeting you. >> Oh, and meeting me. Oh, thanks, Lu. I appreciate that. >> She just threw you a bone. >> Oh. >> A real bone. >> Literally, threw me a bone. Yeah, that's good. >> He's a smart aleck. He's like razzing you. >> What does he say? >> He says-- he's like what are you talking about? We go way back. Like when you talk about aren't you impressed? Like what are you talking about? We go way back. And it's kind of like where are you? But he's just kind of like beating you up, you know how? >> I know. That was our relationship.
