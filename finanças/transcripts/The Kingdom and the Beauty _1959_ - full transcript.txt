And one of them is... a star of Her Majesty. That shows she is no longer in favour. The other stars indicate, the welfare of the people, as well as prestige of the court. Your Majesty, please observe your duties. If an emperor buys service, then the minister is not honest. Even if he is strong in learning and talents he is weak in orals and virtues. If an emperor respects his ministers, then the minister is noble. Then the rule will be just, and the people happy and prosperous The waters are warm; the hills green. Peach blossoms bloom in the spring breeze. Everyone says Kiang-nan is fine. Its scenes are most enchanting. Fish abound, the fruits are sweet, Vegetables delight more than meat.

How about you? I'll take all responsibility. Go quickly and pack your things. Yes, Sire. Come back. On no condition must this leak out. Yes. Prepare some plain clothes for me. Yes, sir The throne is empty on this morning. The court ministers are all worried. No one knows where the emperor has gone The old royal tutor is most worried. Arise Arise. Thank you, Your Majesty. I got up early to attend to His Majesty But His Majesty the Emperor has left. Whose idea was this? The Royal Tutor praised Kiang-nan yesterday. His Majesty's interest was stirred. Your humble minister... tried to dissuade him. Oh! Royal Tutor! Yes, Your Majesty. Did you know about His Majesty's secret trip Your humble old minister did not. The Emperor is young and restless. He was entrusted to you, by the late Emperor How could you do if you must, How can you exaggerate Kiang-nan? What if something should happen to him! How can you answer the late Emperor? My crime deserves 10,000 deaths. You are an old faithful minister. I give you one month to bring him back. Yes, your Majesty. Heavenly blossoms are in bloom. Gay with colours, Spring's here. With these flowers I'll descend to earth, To bring to mortals the joys of spring. Their beauty is beyond compare. And a challenge to the artists' brush Who loves the flowers of heaven? Let's give them to the romantic Let's give them to the romantic Your Majesty has had a tiring day. Please sleep early tonight. Tomorrow we'll have to leave early. I want to remain here for a couple of days. Do you know... ?who was the Heavenly Maid? Your humble servant does not. You may go. Guileless Emperor has lost his heart. All night long, he tossed about. Up with the dawn, he's on his way, To find the girl of yesterday. You're so dumb. You don't look like an Emperor. We won't play. Alright! Let's try again. Forget about it. Stupid!

He covered the town, but could not find her Her thoughts in his heart he longed for a drink Attendant! Give me your best wine... Oh! It's you! Excellent! So it's you! Excellent! What do you want? What I would like to know is, The fair girl at the parade yesterday ...where is she? You're asking about the girl?

You're the emperor don't talk of money You're not worth a dime today. Leave, leave I want to ask if this is a wine shop? What if it is then? Then I certainly can have a few cups of wine We have wine, but we won't sell. Why not? We won't do business today. Nonsense! You must sell wine. You must sell wine. I definitely won't.

It makes me restless and sleepless too Name is Chu Te-Cheng, home Peking. 20 years old and good looking! What are you doing here? I'm in love with a wine shop maid. You are very rude. My brother is away, we won't sell wine. She's more intoxicating than wine. We're respectable wine merchants We know not of love or romances. Why then are you restless and sleepless? C'mon, what're you really driving at? Behave! Or we'll retaliate. Mind your own business. My intentions are good. Why does he insult me? But you do have an ulterior motive. My handkerchief is covered with writing The writing is worth a city. Composed by the Emperor and embroidered by the Empress You are guilty of pretence and deceit Your shop's name slights the emperor. The name of Dragon is known far and wide Even the emperor doesn't mind. Forget that, we'll talk of our wedding. You're lovely and you're smart. When I first saw you I lost my heart. If you're willing I'll take you to Peking The Dragon and the Phoenix will mate. When I first saw you, I was disgusted. If you take her away, I'll fight you. Don't think you can bully us. Ta Niu, keep quiet. In Mei Lung town, our codes are strict I'm afraid tongues may wag. When he is home, you may come again. Did you hear that? She asked you to go! Why are you so impolite? He is a tricky one. That man took advantage of me yesterday And is taking advantage of you today. His intentions were good. Why should you drive him away? Get back! You! You're still here? My intentions are good. Why should you drive him away? I'll never leave here. Won't leave, eh? Wait till my brother comes back. You may fear your brother, but I don't.

I've lost my heart and soul to you. I would rather be an attendant in this shop. Ha, I played an Emperor Yesterday you stole my role away. Today, you want to steal my job! I've never wronged you. Why are you always against me? This shop can afford one more attendant We don't want you. Don't think that you are somebody. It's here. It's there. It's there now. It's there now. We better run! Where's it? If you had lost my emperor...! You saw me ready to risk life for you What? You call that emperor? Do you think an emperor is that important? Let me tell you Its call is sweeter than yours by far. Of course. You're wrong. This is a very ordinary type. At home I have some good ones who seldom call There's a cricket in our backyard. which calls once or twice everyday Ta Niu and I tried to catch it but didn't succeed You must know how to catch them. You have to distinguish them Each different type must be caught, in a different way He is so good at it, ask him to help us Will you come tonight... to help us catch it? Yes, come and help us. Fine. Excellent! I've got it! I've got it! Not bad! It is quite a good one. Let me see it! Careful! Don't break its leg. Ta Niu! Ta Niu! Brother is back. I'm here! Does it matter? Of course it does! How can you be here at this late hour? Terrible! Terrible! Ta Niu! Ta Niu! Go into her room and hide. Yeah, that would be great! How can that be? Hurry! I'll open the door. Ta Niu! Coming! Come on then. Why did you take so long? We were in the backyard catching... The hens. The hens ran loose. Brother! You're back? Yes. Aren't you in bed yet! No. Your sister-in-law asked me to bring this. Did you sell any wine today? No. Not even to the emperor! No. No one else came in too No. You should go to bed now. Go to bed. This is terrible! It's my throat! Ta Niu! Why aren't you in bed yet? What shall we do? How can you laugh? Go out! Go out? Alright I will Oh no! Come back! Come back? Alright I'll come back. It got out. No don't! Don't! This is terrible! Terrible! What is terrible? There's a cat upstairs. I fear it might have at the fish... Nonsense! Go to sleep. Sweet is Autumn. Long is its night. Spring cannot offer such delight. Lest from a dream they rudely wake, Lovers in Autumn quickly mate. He wears a noble's robe beneath. A raven cannot with a phoenix wed. They can't be matched. To be like him There's no equivalent What are you thinking of? Could it be that at night... It was all your fault. It's destiny. How can you blame me? I'm a peasant girl, I can't match you. I'm in the south while you're in the north. Fate brought us together. It'll be all right But you will leave one day. I will not be untrue to you. I vow that I'll never leave you May the Emperor live 10,000 years! Why did you come here? To escort Your Imperial Majesty. It's calm here Why such a show of force? The Empress Mother has been worried. She sent us to meet you, Sire. Please rise in respect I know that. Wait! Yes, Your Majesty. Stay there. His Majesty is upstairs. From today, you're my empress. That's all that matters You should smile. Don't cry. We've just met. Now we must part. Your leaving now breaks my heart. When will we ever meet again? I'll send for you right away. We can easily meet again. You're on a hill top, I beneath the sea How can I ever send word to thee! You must never forget me. I have to leave now, but you need not regret You're my empress, how can I forget? My love is true, I declare. An Empress' crown I needn't wear. Don't cast me aside is all I ask. I'm not a faithless man. My kingdom I can give up, but not you Don't worry, on reaching the capital I'll send for you. I have only to give you this handkerchief. Take it and my tears with you. The strains of farewell, tore their hearts! She asked him not to forget. He pledged. With a lot of emotions... He went his way, but with her heart. Day and night she waited, far apart. My respects, Mother. Liang Chu, Chou Yung, pay homage to Her Majesty If I had not sent them, you would not be back yet. Your son knows that he is at fault. You are the Emperor. How can you be so frivolous? What if something untoward had happened? Chou Yung! You dared to accompany the Emperor! What should be the penalty for your crime? Your servant deserves 10,000 deaths. Your son took the opportunity to go with him. It is all your son's fault Now that the Emperor has safely returned Chou Yung is pardoned. Arise. Thank you, Your Majesty. The period of mourning is over. He's 20 years old, but still a child at heart The reason is his bachelor-hood. When he is married, he will be different. Royal Tutor! Send out the proclamations An Empress will be chosen. Your son has already chosen an empress. A plea to accept it What? You already have! Which noble or lord's daughter is she? She is... Does the Royal Tutor know? She is a wine-shop maid. Ah, I think you young people are so silly How can a wine-shop maid be an Empress? She is beautiful, well versed in the classics, and she is very virtuous Our country, our family has its codes. Our family code has been strictly kept. Our family code has been strictly kept. An Empress must be chosen, only from nobility. The codes cannot be broken by us. The codes cannot be broken by us. But mother! Say no more, Liu Chin Yes Give out the order Everyone here prepare for the choice of Queen. Yes, Your Majesty! But mother! Go Leave! Do as you are told. Yes, Your Majesty. Their meeting was like a dream. They had hurriedly parted. Your Majesty! Some refreshments. Leave it there. Yes They had hurriedly parted. You have not eaten anything. Your humble slave will be in trouble, if Her Majesty the Empress Mother finds out! Your Majesty is the leader, is the leader of the people You are worshipped by people. Only a noble lady can merit, the love of the Son of Heaven. Why a wine-shop girl? Those who eat in a wine-shop, are none other than lowly peasants People of the state, will ridicule you if you crown as an empress a woman who serves in a wine-shop. This girl must be used to flirting. How can such a woman, How can such a woman, be crowned as an Empress? Strict are the rules for an Empress Say no more. He has forgotten, but she has not who could better know her woes A child by him she has got. He's not here, but I'm with the child. If his messenger doesn't come now, To see him then, I must wait another year. Sister! Sister! What's the matter? Nothing's the matter. Are you? Why didn't you tell me earlier? Now that it's happened Crying will be of no use. This way only you'll suffer Later, you just stay in your room When the child is born, we'll say it's mine Said he'll have me fetched on reaching Beijing Don't talk now. Go to sleep! An empress is chosen. All is gay With his harem, he spends the day. The same delight as the last, But who remembers his love past? Here's a joke from Mei Lung town. A big joke of this year An unwed maiden bears a son. It's really worth a laugh Here's a joke from Mei Lung town. A big joke of this year Her own son, her nephew becomes! It's really worth a laugh How is your little nephew? Very well, Thank you. Very well! Still pretending! She's unmarried but a mother. How can she ever get married? Ta Feng! What happened? No! Nothing! Why, it's a little bastard then. Other issues don't matter It may ruin the prosperity of this town. Yeah! That would be bad. Don't cry. It was all mother's fault. To whom can I tell the wrong done to me. For my sin you have to suffer. and bear with taunts But for you, this life I would end Romantic Emperor, without a care, Wining and dancing all day long. In a far-off house, he's not aware, That she's sick and pining away. The moon is lovely tonight. Yes. It is lovely! The moon is full when life is full. Well said. Reward him with wine. Thank you, Your Majesty. No, now, don't cry. Sister...! Ta Feng. Ta Feng... What happened? Sister is gone! Oh! Ta Feng! Ta Feng! Where did she go? You stay and look after the child. Ta Feng! Ta Feng! Sister Feng! Ta Feng! Ta Feng! Sister Feng! Ta Feng! Sister Feng! Ta Feng! Sister Feng! An Emperor I've never seen. Can't imagine... Without a beard you'd never do, Use a false one without ado. The moon shines bright as before, The crickets call as of yore. Since I saw you last, Why is there no word from you? I don't want to be an empress. Let fervent vows you once made, flow by All their mocking words, I'll pretend, I've never heard or seen I don't regret anything I only hope to see you by this tree again. To play with me once more And also to see the son of yours. Ta Feng! Ta Feng! You... Why do you do this? Come home Seeing her so sick and wan, Her family is in pain. But for this family, I'd go to Peking. Even if he's the Emperor, I'd settle the score with him. Ta Niu! Ta Niu! Ta Niu! Ta Niu! Ta Niu! Ta Niu! What happened? What happened? Ta Niu! Ta Niu! Sister, How are you! What happened to Ta Niu? Snow and wind he bravely face, Hunger and cold never halt his pace. Determined to find the faithless one, And ask him what's to be done. In Mei Lung town, this happened true, I'll tell you. And I'll tell you. Listen and understand In the town there is a small place wine-shop Selling wine there is Miss Li Feng. Her eyes so lovely her lips so red. Just turned 18 and still unwed. Still unwed. One day there came Chu Te-Cheng. Said he had come looking for Chu Te-cheng The Emperor in his wandering, He lost his head at first sight. He wooed her that very night, And wooed her that very night. A night of love and he went his way, He left for Peking the very next day. He made her Empress at their parting, Vowing the send for her from Peking. Three long years, have slowly passed by; Leaving Li Feng alone to sigh. Leaving Li Feng alone to sigh. Waiting day and night she wasted away, She bore him a child and hid day. The neighbours mock and they jeer, Li Feng is alone to shed her tears. Left alone to shed her tears ...to bear it all within her She lives in a dream world of her own, The wrong done her, who'll atone? She's almost mad and near her end, But still in waiting her days are spent. Waiting for the Emperor that faithless cad, Now what do you say? Isn't it sad! It's a matter of great distress! How dare you insult the Emperor? How many heads do you have to pay! Don't listen to him, drag him away I'm innocent! Shut up! I'm innocent! Let me go! What is it? A man is blocking the way. Bring him to me. Yes? I'm innocent! It's you! Oh God! How could I forget her? Why didn't you remind me? Chou Yung! Yes Sire. Why didn't you remind me? If Ta Niu had not come, she would have died. Regretting will not help matters. Ta Niu has come to see you. Li Feng must be very sick. Your Majesty must act right away. This is a simple matter. In my humble opinion... Shut up! It was because of your opinions, that I almost became a faithless man. Come with me to see the Empress Mother. Our ancestors' codes can't be broken. But he is flesh of my own flesh. You must grant permission Unless she is from the nobility... Forgive your humble minister's suggestion May I take her for my ward? I don't know if it's okay? If you refuse, I'll give up my throne. I'll be a commoner, ...and be with Li Feng What did you say? Your succession to the throne is the will of Heaven It is not up to you to decide it. However if you don't like, don't be You would be ridiculed in history, if you gave up your throne for a woman. Your Majesty! In your minister's opinion, it would be better to let Li Feng to be my ward For both it'd be advantageous Very well! She shall be your ward. Thank you, Your Majesty! Tai Niu Brother Where did you come from? From the capital. The Emperor has sent for her. Really? It's true. Thank Heaven for that! Sister-in-law Tai Niu I've been missing you. We've been missing you too. My good brother! His Majesty's edict. Kneel! By the order of the Emperor The Great Ming Emperor Cheng-Te orders Li Feng is to leave for capital. In regard to Imperial order There must be no delay. May the Emperor live 10,000 years. Ta Niu Sister Feng Ta Niu I suffered along the way They beat me. Why! They beat you! Are you better now? I'm well now! I'm well now! Why did you come down? You may catch a cold! You are so sick, how can you leave? I'm completely well now. I must go to him right away. Nonsense! How can you leave now? Sister-in-law, Ta Niu, Brother Today I have his reply, If I had wings, to him I'd fly. For me you've worried, ...and toiled a lot too And Ta Niu had for my sake, Braved hunger and cold and beatings take. You've all done a great deal for me, In my memories you'll forever be. Oh my child! You're lucky now You'll have what others won't, Mother'll leave now and you'll follow. Don't let her wait long Worries brushed off with one stroke, Tears no longer need I evoke. For the ages. Powder and scent I'll spray, A look at the mirror and I'll be on my way. To the King Kang god I'll pray, Hold your lightening and your thunder. I'll pray to General Wei, take pity on a traveler May my carriage be as swift, and I can arrive at an early day Now I'll ask the 18 Buddhas Please use your great powers to drive my sorrows away I beg you, merciful Kwan Yin I beg you, merciful Kwan Yin Please help this suffering mortal Ah... My eyes look forward to Peking My heart is worried about Mei Lung town My husband is ahead, my child is waiting I'll never rest if I die on the way. I ask not for longevity, All I ask is for a drop of elixir To preserve this life three more days. Let me see him just once more Then I can die in peace A glimpse of a frightened swan Their meeting was like a dream Before reach the Lunar Palace They had hurriedly parted They had hurriedly parted
