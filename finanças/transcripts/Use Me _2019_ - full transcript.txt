Rose! Hey. I didn't know who else I could call. God, what's wrong? I'm at the airport. I don't know what to do. I don't know if I should come back to Sydney or what I should do. I got no money. Julian... Let me just ask you one question. Are you filming this? Like, right now, are you filming this? All right. Speaking of documentaries, though, you're now venturing onto your third feature, uh, which is about a lady named Ceara Lynch. You've done your research. Now, I did do a little bit of research. I was kind of... Did you do the research in front of your wife? That's the question. I did run it past her. - A Mental? - Humiliatrix. - Humiliatrix. - Mental Humiliatrix, that's her official job title. There are people who pay her vast sums of money, basically, for the privilege of being used. She doesn't meet any of her clients in person. Everything's virtual. She's kind of living the American dream. That depends on your definition of the American dream. - What's yours? - For me, it's pretty obvious. If you can make a movie that's a hit in America, you've made it. How did you come across her in the first instance? Well, actually it was her idea. She found me online and we Skyped, and we just hit it off right away. - Hi. - Hey, bitch. How's it goin'? Very good, thank you. We ended up Skyping for hours. She completely convinced me to go over there. I sold my car, I withdrew all my savings. People have this image in their mind of who a person is, and my job is to go in there with a camera and find the truth behind that. I want you to blackmail me and threaten to tell my boss at work my secret. I want you take everything from me. Use me until I have nothing left. I love to get used. You are on top. In this business, Ceara Lynch, she is the gold standard. You're a complete stranger and you're going to explore in a world of debauchery and insanity. Just watch your back, man. There's a lot of beautiful women out there that would never be able to do this at all. Oh, my God, I am so sick of hearing you say that. You filthy whore. The internet is my dungeon. Ceara completely changed my life. And I'll have you by the balls. I have seen her cut through men like warm butter. There's a fine line between fantasy and reality. I think I saved the best for last. So what is the American dream? Traditionally, the American dream is pulling yourself up from the bootstraps and making it big on your own terms. You can rise from the bottom to the top in America. It draws people in from all over the world. I mean, look at you. You're from Australia and you're making a movie in America, so I think that's proof that you're trying to live the American dream, too. Um... I guess, what I'm saying is good luck. And I really hope you find what you're looking for. How you feeling? - Nervous? - Little bit. You don't ever look nervous. That beard just masks your emotions. I know, you can't see it behind the beard. All right. So, pretty much, just don't ever cut and it'll be fine. - Okay. - Yeah, just keep rolling. - Hello. - Hey! - How are you? - Good, you made it. - I got my guy with me. - Hey. - How are you? - Good. - Nice to see you. - Yeah, you too. - Here. - Thank you. I don't really drink at the moment, but that's... - Ah, you'll drink today. - Okay, whatever you say. Let's go feed my chickens. My backyard. So we got, the two black and white ones are Amelia and Bodelia. We got the white one, that's Cruella. Betty is the yellow one. Goldy Hen. And Miss America is the Americana. So you want to see the house? We got my bedroom. This is my office space. And this room is where all the magic happens. Get your ass all nice and ready for me. If you didn't have money, I wouldn't even spit in your general direction. Do you understand? So, basically, a guy emails me, tells me his fantasy, and I make it come to life. What are you looking for, hmm? My dirty panties again? Your wife doesn't know anything about you. Eat another human being. Do you want to be my dog? From inside the cage, you give me female hormone injections. I'd love to see you forcibly make a guy turn gay by Pavlovian conditioning. You breaking my ribs with a baseball bat. This guy, I think has like cinematic movies going on in his head when he masturbates. Are you wearing panties right now? Because I haven't talked to you in such a long time. You're the most amazing thing in my life. - Yeah, I believe that. - I want to jerk off. Better not crash, better keep your eye on the road. I sell panties, socks, shoes, pantyhose, toenail clippings, used Kleenex, piss, used hair from my hair brush. So, I sold my shit recently to a guy for $4,000, and I was a little worried because I don't know the legalities around shipping waste. So I emailed my lawyer, but he was really cool about it. - He said... - That's genius! And it really, to me, it's a triumph of capitalism and really one of those things where, uh... you know, from an entrepreneurial spirit, really, just adds to the American dream in a certain way. So I have what's called my Ignore Line. Guys will call, um... Have fun. ...and I put them on hold. And as long as they stay on the line, I get paid $5 a minute. So, Financial Domination is basically where guys literally get off on giving a woman their money. The most I've ever had anyone spend was $20,000 and it was a guy, he was watching me on Skype, and he set up a Saks Fifth Avenue account. He put in all the credit card information, all of his information, and then he gave me the login. And then the session was just him watching me shop. You know, I was telling him, "Oh, I'm going to buy this Prada handbag. I'm going to buy this Burberry coat," and just racking up his bill. He loved that I was using his credit card. I have a degree in psychology, so I'm curious about how the human mind works and sexuality has always fascinated me. The Diamond Experience isn't really something I do for money. It's just part of my research on male sexuality. So, if a guy comes to me with an issue and I think I can help him, we'll start to talk. Every case is different. So that could mean I act as their therapist or it could be like a role-play. Sometimes, I set up these fantasy scenarios. All right, showtime. Whatever it takes. I would probably have trouble getting off if it weren't for her. I think I would have far worse erectile dysfunction. And now I'm actually able to function normally in everyday life. I used to have a problem with intimacy. But because of Ceara, the problem's gone. Yeah, I just pay attention, you know? Because, at the end of the day, these are all male desires. These aren't my desires. And I've just been doing it so long that I know, like, what seems to work. So, what are your absolute hard limits? I don't get naked on camera, I don't have sex on camera, and I don't do sessions in real life. My whole brand is supposed to be that I'm unattainable. That guys aren't worthy of seeing me naked. I'm holier than thou. I'm a goddess. So if I were to get naked, that's giving something up. - Hello! - Hey, guys. - I'm Julian. - Hi. What up? How you doing? Nice to meet you. Everybody knows Ceara. Everybody that's in this part - of that industry knows who Ceara is. - Mm-hmm. - Gotcha. - Yep. You were about to say, she's a little bit like - her character, you think? - Oh, oh, shh, yeah, I just feel like there's just something else in there that's just, yeah, I don't know. - Satan, it's Satan. - Yeah. In fact, I bet there's a 666 right behind her ear. - I'm pretty sure. - No. - I told you. - No, I'm just glad I'm on her good side. That's what I meant to say. - Really? Wow. - I'm on her good side. We're good. Are we having fun yet? Show him how it's done, please? - Oh, my gosh, no. - What, you didn't like that? That was weak. Jesus Christ! What's going on? Oh, God! - Woo! - Okay. Here you go. When she was about 16, I mean, I knew she was making money, and I didn't know where she was getting her money from. I came home from work one day and here on the dining room table is this Manila envelope with something in it, addressed to somebody in Florida. So I open it up and she was selling panties, and I got really upset. So I did what any dad would do. I threw her panties away, I put a dirty pair of my underwear in with her note, sealed 'em up, and mailed them off to the guy. Once I figured out that she was safe, that people can't find her, and there's firewalls, you know. It's all through telephone or on the internet. There's no actual meeting people. Okay, yeah, it sounds pretty... You know, I would've preferred brain surgeon, but, you know. Yeah, just kind of a normal American suburb upbringing. Yeah, money was really tight when I was born. The first house that I lived at was a trailer park, actually. 1702. I actually have nothing but happy childhood memories. And after the trailer park, I lived in this farmhouse for a while. But it's all abandoned now. Yeah, I think I had a very different idea of what my future would be back then. A few things I remember growing up, Jehovah Witnesses, they don't believe in Heaven or Hell. They believe that there's an Armageddon coming, and it's coming really soon. And that's going to basically wipe out everyone that isn't a Jehovah Witness. And then Paradise comes after to everyone that follows Jehovah. So we tried for a while with the idea of kids, you should give 'em some sort of foundation, but we lost faith in the organization and then left. So I was away on vacation with my parents at Cobble Beach. So there were two boys and me. And I can't remember what our parents were doing, but me and the boys were left alone. And one of the guys had, uh, like, a dirty magazine, like a Hustler. He showed us this page of these two beautiful, glamorous women, uh, sucking each other's toes. And... I look at his pants and he's getting hard. I mean, it was under his pants, but I had never really seen an erection in person. Right as I saw his penis, the earth started shaking. And I totally freaked out. I started thinking about Armageddon. And I just, like, booked it out the door. I just ran, and I just saw this light, like this really bright white light. I thought at the time that it was the light of Jehovah and, um, that I was running towards Paradise. I realized it was, uh, just the lighthouse and waited it out until the earth stood still again. It wasn't even, like, a serious earthquake, but, uh, it was just crazy timing. It really freaked me out. Never told anyone that before. - Exclusive! - Yeah! Is there ever any risk with these fantasies that are more extreme that you're going to go too far? No, I would never do anything that I wasn't asked to do. The illusion is that I'm the one in control. But, really, they're telling me what do to. It's very clear what they want and that's exactly what I give 'em. I think it's really important to draw a distinction between a fetish and an addiction. A fetish is something abnormal that gets you off sexually. It's called a paraphilia. It literally means you have a sexual attraction to non-sexual things. An addiction on the other hand, is a compulsive behavior that's unhealthy or disruptive to your life. Let's say you get off on women's shoes. It's not something that most people find sexually arousing, so it's considered a fetish. However, if you start going into women's shoe stores, stealing high heels, and taking them home to masturbate over them? - That's an addiction. - If I get the sense that a guy really has an addiction and is ruining his life, then I do feel some responsibility to help him. After a while, it's not very fulfilling just getting guys off. What I really find satisfying is if I feel like I've truly helped them in a way that they can't help themselves. For me, it's more than a sexual outlet. I know that what she does offers release. So perhaps it has some psychological value. Perhaps, it has some therapy. I didn't even know I was addicted. I didn't know you could be addicted to what I was addicted to. You know, a lot of guys have these desires that they can't share with, you know, their wife or their girlfriend or, you know. I and anyone else who is in my profession are pretty much the only people that really hear about it. I've basically carvedM a niche helping men with strange addictions. For instance, I had this one guy who couldn't put his smartphone down without having a panic attack. I had another guy who was addicted to being kicked in the balls to the point where he might not be able to have kids. I got a rush out of that. That was, like, a thrill. Well, we all know about drug addiction. But addiction to behavior or addiction to inanimate objects can be quite compelling for people. So if you have tried everything else, maybe your best bet is an Online Humiliatrix with a psychology degree. I'm feeling good. I'm feeling like my instincts were right. That she is an amazing subject and has a lot of complexity. More than I thought originally. Oh, my God. Just beautiful. You know, at least I get paid for filming myself. - What's your excuse? - What do you mean, what's my excuse? - You're always filming yourself. - Yeah, what's wrong with that? Why do you do it? - Well. - It's kind of narcissistic. Oh, and being a cam girl isn't narcissistic? Again, I get paid for it. I wouldn't be doing it if I wasn't bringing money for it. All right, well... And it kind of sucks 'cause I'm meant to be going back to Australia soon, but I kind of don't want to leave. I feel like there's so much more to this story. - Road trip! - Woo-hoo! I mean, I don't think I've ever met anybody like her. She's... ...she's really special. But I've already used all my savings just getting this far. What do you think about doing a Kickstarter campaign? Yeah, I'd be down. Yeah, we could just keep shooting. I don't have to leave. - I like money. - I like money, too. Money's good. Oh, my project is launched! Yeah! How much are you going to pledge? - $100. - All right, let's see it. So it's essentially a documentary about - what we're talking about here. - Yeah, about me. - Yeah, focused on me. - About humiliation. About how these guys want you to do these things to them. - Exactly. - And threaten them. And refresh. Oh, look at that! 82 backers, 11,344! Good boy! Yeah. - Holy shit! - There's 24 hours to go, we're still $7,000 short. If we don't reach our target, the film is not getting made. Have you seen the Kickstarter? Like, in the past 15 minutes? So, this guy is willing to put $7,500 in the Kickstarter if we do a make-out video. That's it, just kissing. I'd do that for free. Can you believe that? - Ha! - Hello. Hello. I brought wardrobe options. - How are you doing, nervous? - I'm a little anxious. - How are you feeling? - Fine. - Yeah, I could see that. - It's not my first rodeo. Okay, I have this guy's notes, his requests here. - He has a cuckolding fetish. - Okay. So he likes seeing me with guys that are hotter than him. - Okay. - Do not do five seconds of tongue sucking. That is too short. Please make it much longer. That's ridiculous. I know, it's stupid. God. Can you handle this? Yeah, I can handle this. All right. 'Kay, testing one, two, three. Testing one, two, three. Okay... this is good. All right, um, so you don't need to worry about saying anything. I'll start it and then we'll just start kissing, - and so you can take me lead. - Okay. Easiest job in the world. Hi, there. I have quite a little treat for you, my little cuck. I have, right here, a real man. And I'm going to have some fun with him while you sit there and wank your tiny little dick, wishing that you could be a part of it. But, hey, you can, right? You get to pay for it. Enjoy. Hi. Fuck me. Well, he got quite a show. We're not sending that to him. No, definitely not. That would ruin my career. - Question. - Yes? Um, is this going to be weird afterwards, like, with the movie and everything? I'm fine but I don't know. - No, I'm fine. - Okay, okay. You carry this thing everywhere, don't you? I do. I love this little camera. - It's my thing. - Yeah. I've done it for a long time. All guys have their thing. What's the first thing you remember recording? I got my first camera when I was nine years old. - Like, a VHS? - It was a little VHS camera that my mum gave me. In the filming of this week's documentary. I wanted to be a documentary maker. Until next week, this is Julian Shaw saying, "Adios." - I just started filming everything, you know? - Yeah. Intellectually stimulating. I actually made little documentaries in my house. Yeah, of what? About my cats. The unaware and unsuspicious cat. - Your cats? - Yeah. Oh, my God, I want to see that so bad. No one gets to see that. No! Oh, the video camera? No, don't worry, that's not on. Outrageous! Okay, cut! - Mm. - Yeah. Aw. That was actually a pretty fucked up period in my life, to be honest with you. - Why? - Um... My parents went away a lot for work, and I'd go and stay with my mum's sister for like a month at a time. I haven't really told many people about this actually. - Yeah? - Basically, I just have this memory that I always go back to where I'm lying in bed and I'm shaking. I'm so scared, like, I'm going to pee my pants. And I'm just waiting for the sound of the door opening. It happened a couple of times before I got the idea to hide a camera in my room. - Wait, so did you, like, record her? - Mm-hmm. What did she do to you? She had violent fantasies that probably came from her own life.. I Still don't know. She used me, she used me to act them out. It was the worst night of my life, but it was the best thing I've ever shot. That is as real, and ugly, and raw, and... terrible as life gets, and I actually recorded it. And I think that was the moment that I decided that I could make a documentary out of my own life. I just needed to keep filming the most dramatic moments. Sorry, I missed the first part. Can you say that again from the beginning? I've been doing this for so long now that I can't imagine ever stopping. - Hi! - Hello! - You're out the front. - I am out the front. Is it you that eager? That eager? - Are you filming me? - Yeah. I got these for you. As much as I liked recording the nice moments. How beautiful! I was always more drawn to the pain and the fights. You know, that was the best footage. It was just so much better when I could create some drama. Turn it off! If it upsets you that much, if I'm so fucking strange, then fine, whatever, you know, that's just... Stop it! I'm sorry. I like to film stuff that someone else would have stopped recording. I want to be the person who doesn't stop. And when I realized that my girlfriend of ten years was about to break up with me, I was thinking, "I'd better get an angle on myself, 'cause this is going to be gold." If I give you the camera, can you just keep recording? Yeah. Did you turn off the record? You want to check Kickstarter and see if this guy has paid us? Yeah, yeah. You can put that thing down. - Can I? - What you're doing. Well, don't stop recording. Okay, uh, just put it right here? - Mm-hmm. - All right. Let's see. - We're finished. - We're done? 29,846, it feels so good! Yes! We can celebrate with my friends. Oh, there you go! Whoa, that's good. - Oh, boy. - Hello. Someone's frisky. Ooh. Come here. What's the safe word, Julian? I can't remember. - Are you still breathing? - Yeah. You're so fucking beautiful, Ceara! Shouldn't they be paying you if they're really into it? - They're actually paying you, right? - Right. Yeah! Living the American dream. You should smack her pussy again. - Yeah. - Ooh! Whoa! - How you doing? - Morning. Who do I talk to about pushing the, um, checkout back? The present balance of $628.73, all of which is available for use. Dude, don't worry about it. It's just money, it'll be fine. You had a good time. Okay, you know, we were celebrating, you know, Kickstarter, - and we were celebrating... - Yeah. ...that milestone and, you know, that's great. You've got to celebrate things, but I think we kind of have to say that, you know, we can't really do that again. I guess we'll drive back. It will be fine. It's good, it's all good. I'm honestly not that worried about it. >> At the roundabout, take the second exit to US-101. - I'll be back in one second. - Okay. - How are you? - I'm pretty good. I'm looking at a very beautiful sight right now. How's it all going? Uh, it's going really good actually. - Yeah. - Yeah? She's showing me where she grew up and stuff like that. You're not filming this, are you? What do you think? Are you? Julian, are you filming this? I don't really feel like doing anything but lay around and eat pizza, watch bad movies. - You have to pay for your fun. - Yeah. What else is on your mind? How do you feel about the other day? Um... Mm. I feel fine. Yeah, I feel fine. Right. I don't know what else to say. I don't feel weird about it, um. I haven't really thought about it too much, to be honest. Okay. - That's all right. - No offense. Why, how do you feel about it? - Oh, the water's boiling. - Okay. - I'm going to go grab it. - No worries. - All right, standby. - Thanks. In America, you can get to the top, but one simple, little mistake, you could come tumbling right down. Five years ago, I was financially secure. Now, I don't know what's going to happen. Regardless of my adversities I go through, I know I will rise up in America. - Hey, stranger. - Hey. Haven't seen you in a while. Here, I want to show you something. Okay. It's this software where I can, basically, uh, access other guy's computers. - Okay. - So this guy, he just sent me, like, his password information and I can just go in... ...and see what he wants me to see. And look, see, this is his page here. Whoa! So that's his computer and you're just in there? Yeah, so some of these guys like it when I pay myself. So right now, he is on the other side of the computer and he can see all this. Everything, like me moving around this desktop right here, me logging into his account. He's over there, like, enjoying the show. And so he wants me to pay myself. - And how much is he asking for? - Um, he's having me pay myself $100. You put in an extra zero. Oops. There we go. Cool. We thank you for playing fair. I've never seen that notification before. That's funny. Pretty cool, huh? So this guy gets turned on when you take more money from him - than he asked you to take? - It isn't hard to tell what the guy really wants. Like, yeah, he says $100, but he also loves how greedy I am. He loves how I am the type of woman who would, you know... take more money than what was agreed upon, and that sort of thing. So it's like, which part do I listen to? Do I listen to that part? Or do I, you know, trust that... he really only wants me to send $100? So you're saying he's got no problem with you taking $1,000? Mm-mm. Okay. We are back in Vegas shooting at the Adult Entertainment Expo this week. I'm now paying for everything on my credit card, so got to work fast. And ever since I got here, everyone keeps talking about this girl, Princess Cassie. Uh, kind of sounds like she's the new it girl. Ceara's going to be signing autographs, so I might just have a bit of a wander around the convention, explore. Maybe, check out Cassie's booth. See what all the hype is about. I don't really hate her, but I do find her really odd. And she only talks about herself. I actually introduced her to this industry. I brought her into it. I had shot her for some videos and so it was the first time she did the FemDom thing. And she took to it really well. I'm not going to say like, "Oh, I made her," or anything. She just needed to be shown the door and she, you know, totally took full advantage of it. Like, you know, really, really took to it. You love that, don't you? And then, kind of the weirdness came later when she started to become really popular. Again, I don't think she needs to kiss my ass or think that I created her or anything. But she wouldn't be where she was if I hadn't have introduced her to this. - Hello. - How's it going? - Good, how are you? - Good. Nice to see you. - This is Julian. - Hello, how are you doing? - Nice to meet you, Julian. - Normally, I don't do videos like this, but I have a client who pays a lot of money to watch me make out with certain girls, and he likes Cassie, so that's what we're doing today. Hey, can I talk to you for a minute? So, um, it's just going to be like soft-core stuff? Yeah, it's just normal kissing. - Nothing too kinky. - Cool. I think you've seen enough. Princess Ceara was the first one that I saw that I looked and was like, "What the hell is this chick doing to these guys, and making so much money than anybody else?" The Ceara I know is, uh, both kind and gentle. But I have seen her be an absolute stuck up cunt. Ceara isn't quite who she says she is. I don't know, just watch your back, man. This could go down a path you're maybe not ready for it to take. I have seen her just turn on a dime. This is it, fellas. This is as real as it gets. - Hello. - Hello! - How are you, today? - Hello, everybody. You can go in first. - Nice to see you again. - Welcome. - Nice to see you. - How have you been? - I've been good, how about you? - I'm good, I can't complain. - Should I give you a little tour, or? - Yes, a big tour. - Okay. - It's huge. Okay, this is, uh, really what you came for. - Correct? - Yes. Wow, you got anything bigger? Yeah, well, pegging guys with this on camera is what pays for the apartment, so. - That's got to hurt. - I'm sure you recognize this backdrop. I did do a little research. I'm not going to lie. - Yeah, of course you did. - It's unprofessional not to. Yeah. - Yeah, so I just sit? - That's here. - I just sit, and talk, and answer questions and stuff? - Yes. - Okay. - So, you know the definition of an interview? - I do. - That's great. - Thank you! - Amazing. - All right, we could do that. - Um, okay, I'm nervous. - There's no right or wrong answers? - I feel nervous. Interview with Princess Cassie. Well, it was a very interesting day the other day at Ceara's place. - Yeah. - I was very curious to meet you. - You, as well. - Mm-hmm. So, what did you mean when you told me to be careful? I don't know, you just got to keep her at a distance. Like, I mean, she's good in small doses, but then she's pretty poisonous if you, you know, let her in too much. I don't know. I'm not really trying to ruin these guys lives, even though I act like it. You know, "Treat them like shit." I'm not really trying to ruin marriages, - or, you know, so. - Yeah, mm-hmm. Is that what Ceara's doing? She's not, um, you know, as transparent as she appears to be. Could you go into, like, a tiny bit more detail about what... I don't know. Um, honestly, I don't really want to do that. But I can tell you that she has a lot of dirt on these guys and she uses it to get what she wants. Can I get a name or something like that? So I can follow up on this at least, and not involve you. I mean, it would come back to me. No, I can't. But, I mean, if you stick around Ceara long enough, you'll see something, trust me. All right, let's cut there then. - Um, do you want water or anything? - Uh... - I'm okay. - Wine, or... - Yeah. - Cool. Could you please just give me a name? Please? Thanks. Talk to you soon. And look, see, this is his page here. You put in an extra zero. Oops. We thank you for playing fair. I've never seen that notification before. That's funny. I always question which side to get in on the car. All right, she's hiding something for sure. And, now, I just need to figure out what it is. Hi. - Hey. - How you doing? I'm Julian, nice to, um, meet you. Yeah, hi, can you please try to explain to me again - exact... - Of course. Well, yeah, I was trying to explain in that message, um, I got your contacts, um... because I've been actually doing a documentary film about Ceara. And I saw all of your details one time when she opened up, - kind of, like, took control of your computer. - Uh, how did you... How did you get my information? Well, I could see your Skype name and stuff like that. Everything was open so, yeah. Fuck! I don't want to know what his real-life situation is. And these guys have a fetish for being ruined, so, yeah, how do you tell? Brilliant, I think that's good. Cool. Good day. Dope. Come here, kitty. Come here, baby. How you doing? All right, listen, don't get angry. I got your number from her phone. I just have one question. Then, I'm going to leave you alone, okay? What is it, what? Did you want her to take that $1,000 from you? Why do you want to know that? Look, dude, I'm just trying to figure out - what's real and what isn't. - You know what? It's complicated. It doesn't really matter. Explain what complicated means. Okay, look. I used to love it when she would take control of situations, but I would never, never have told her to take thousands of dollars out of my bank account, all right? I have a daughter. I have a baby on its way. I can't afford that. So why don't you just ask her for the money back? She has a video of me, and I have a wife who is upstairs taking a nap right now, who's asleep. I can't ever have her see that video, ever in my life. Hang on, hang on, wait, wait. Wait, is this the fantasy or is this real, what you're saying? This is very real. If my wife ever sees that video, she will leave me in a heartbeat. So that cannot happen, ever, okay? Okay, listen, maybe there's a way that I can help you. Maybe she doesn't understand what your situation is? Maybe you need to explain the situation to her face to face. Ceara Lynch doesn't meet people face to face, so that's just not going to happen, okay? Do you think I'm not aware of that? Look, I'm thinking that there could be a way that I could connect you with her and you could tell her this to her face. How would you do that? Simple, I mean, we'd be having lunch somewhere and you just happen to be on the street that day. Luke, listen to me. You need to do this. You need to meet her. You need to look into her eyes and tell her what you just told me. Otherwise, she's going to keep taking money from you and it's never going to end. You just want to keep being her bitch? 'Kay, just got to get my stuff here and then I'm going to put it right up here. Actually, the T-shirt's a little bit high... She got this guy because he was horny and vulnerable, and he gave her something. He started playing a game that he didn't know the rules to. And she can just change the rules. She's taken $45,000 from this guy. - That's criminal. - Hit record. The numbers will start ticking away. - Okay. - And you're recording. Give me a thumbs up if you can hear this. Okay. - Hello. - Hey. - How you doing? - Good, how are you? I'm good, what's happening? Not too much, hungry. Is it too early for a cocktail? That sounds nice. What's the difference between tomato jam and ketchup, I wonder? I don't know. I might just call my friend real quick. Yeah. - Hello. - Hey, brother. What's happening? Where are you right now? - Where are you right now? - Um... Right this second? Can you see me? Can you see me? So just come. So just come. Fuck. Can you stop being a fucking pussy, and just come and do this thing? Huh? No, I'm saying... I don't think you're a pussy. I'm saying don't act like a pussy. Hey, hey, hey, hey! What? She took $45,000 from him and he still doesn't have the balls to confront her. I mean, according to her, she hasn't even done anything wrong. But if he's not going to confront her, then it's pretty much left up to me. I've got the recording of my conversation with Luke where he says that she's blackmailing him. So all I have to do, really, is play that to her, then she has to address it. It could be the end of my relationship with her, but it's going to be amazing footage one way or another. Pretty much just stick on her close up, I think. - On her close up? - Just get her reaction shots and I'll... Yeah, yeah, just focus on her. Ceara? Ceara?! Ceara! Fuck. Fuck! Luke? Hey, hey, hey. Yes, Luke, I will help you get the money. Just relax. Where are you right now? I won't call the police. Okay, okay. Luke? Luke? Okay, no cameras. Where are you? What are you doing? Keep rolling. Come on, come on, Erica! - Woo-hoo! - Fight, fight, yes! Woo! Shit. Julian? What the fuck, man? Hey, Luke, what are you doing? What the fuck? Ceara! Julian, what are you doing here? Julian! Are you okay? Oh, my God, what the fuck? Okay. Are you fucking kidding me? Dude, I don't have 45K! I've got two kids and I don't work. - Like, are you serious? - I'm aware of that, okay? All right, look, I'm just sorry that I called you. - I love you and... - Is this on film? Are you filming me? What is going on? Listen, I love you. I'll call you soon, all right? Are you filming me now? All right. You're going to just, you're going to have to... do what I say, and you're probably not going to like it. Okay. It's almost 9 a.m. and we're still $15,000 short. And, um... I don't want to do this, but Cassie said that I could get $15,000 at least if I do this. If I don't do this, I don't know what's going to happen to Ceara. Hey, it's Julian Shaw. How you doing? So listen, that tape of Ceara and I... There was a lot of stuff that we didn't show you. This is the only sex tape of Ceara that exists, all right? Listen, it is worth every cent. You just have to promise me you'll never tell anyone about this, all right? This is between you and I. This is our secret. You can't tell Ceara that you have this. If you care about her, you will never tell her that you have this. Send me the money and I'll send you the tape. Okay. Aw, fuck. A person can do whatever they want in this country and determine their own self-destiny. A lot of people worship at money's altar every morning. Money can get you free or it can get you hurt. How you doing? Hello. Uh, no, I'm all good, my man. - Know where you're going? - Yeah, all good, man. - Thank you though. - What number you need? What's the camera for anyways? Nah, man. Nah, we're not filming you. I just, you know, I'm... - Hey, there's no filming 'round here! - That's cool, dude. - These are people's homes! - I know, I get that. - It's private property. - We're not shooting you. - It's all good. - No, hey, man. - Dude, relax. - Where are you from anyways? - I'm from Sydney, Australia, okay? - You're a long way from home. - I know. - I suggest you get going right now. I'm going, mate. I hear you, absolutely. Not without that camera though. Put that thing away. It's all good, man. It's not even rolling. - You're good, you're good. - How do I know it's not rolling? - Get the fuck over here! - No, listen. - We're getting scenic shots for a documentary. - Where the hell you going? I am actually trying to leave and you're actually blocking my way. - With respect, okay. - This spot goes way over the boundary of my property. How am I going to leave if you don't get out of my way? With respect, I'm actually trying to leave your property. - Really? You trying to leave? - I'm actually trying to go. With that and with that big ass camera? Hey, it's all good, bro. Just relax, it's all good. Put that shit down. Don't tell me what to put down. Get your fucking hands off me, you motherfucker! - Get the fuck away from my camera. - Gimme that fuckin' camera! Hey, put that fucking shit down! Go! Go! You didn't have to fire that. He ain't here, idiot, let's go. God dammit. Let's go, Dell. Come on. Okay, 10, 15, 25, 35, 45 thousand. It's in the bag. Now, tell me where she is. Is this it? I'm going to leave the headlights on. It stinks. Ceara! Ceara? Ceara? I did everything you asked! Please, man, I'm fucking exhausted. All right? I gave you the money. Come on, get in! Listen, Cassie, I know where she is. I'll pick you up on the way, all right? Jehovah Witnesses, they don't believe in Heaven or Hell. They believe that there's an Armageddon coming, and it's coming really soon. And then Paradise comes after to everyone that follows Jehovah. The earth started shaking and I totally freaked out. I just, like, ran and I just saw this light, like this really bright white light. And I just felt like, "Look, if I head towards this light, I'll be okay." Cassie, call an ambulance! Hi, uh, I need to report an unconscious woman at Cobble Beach. Um, she's about a quarter mile away from the lighthouse. Just drive, let's go! In America, you can be a king one day and a bum the next. You can fall really far and harder. Freedom? Oh, man, that's just a word, man. I mean, like, nothing's free in America. When you're pursuing the dream, you got to be careful 'cause you might not like who you become. Cassie, call an ambulance! I'm sure she's shaken up, but she's alive. It's going to be fine. I need to report an unconscious woman at Cobble Beach. I don't know what she knows. I don't know how she is. - I don't remember 99% of it. - Mm-hmm. I was in my back porch... just like, on my laptop and I just remember... the briefest second, like, getting tackled almost. I don't remember getting hurt. Um, but it was just blackout, and then I woke up in the hospital. I'm so glad you're okay. I've never even been, like, stalked. I mean. You don't remember anything about the guy? Anything, I mean. Um... Like, a heavier set guy. My memory is literally just kind of this almost, like, blurred. You know how when you take a picture when someone's moving. - Just, like, really quick. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You told the police all this? - Yeah. - Right, yeah. I mean, I'm sure they'll want to talk to you soon. But you're okay. I mean, you're actually fine. This is going to be hard. Hang on, let me just. Um, how are you holding up? How are you doing? Um, I guess I'm all right. Okay. Um, okay, I actually have some things I really need to tell you, and I'm just going to put it out there. - Okay. - And just be honest with you, like we always try to do, I think, with each other. Okay. And I just want to say, as well, that I've always had your best interests at heart from the very beginning with this whole project and everything else, you know? So... Luke was the one that took you. I was trying to do a scene where he was going to confront you at the diner, and that was all it was meant to be. But I don't know if he followed you home or what. There's more. So, the... The sex tape of us... I sold it to get you back. We're still rolling. Look, hey, just hang on a sec. Ceara, seriously. Listen, I fucked up. Don't fucking touch me. Don't fucking touch me! - Ceara. - No, fuck you. What are you doing? Julian, what are you doing? Julian, stop! What are you looking for? Get that fucking camera out of my face! Cassie, I saw the text messages! Why would you have the money that I gave to Luke? Now would be a good time to tell me. What do you really know? Fuck you both. Hey, leave me a message. - Hey, leave me a message. - Ceara, it's me. Listen, Luke and Cassie are fucking with both of us. I'm in the car. I'm coming to your house. I'm going to be there in ten minutes. Don't go anywhere. Just open the door, please! - How are you? - Hey. Good. - Nice to see you. - Yeah, you too! Hi. Ceara, seriously. Listen, I fucked up. Don't fucking touch me. Don't fucking touch me! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! Rose! - Hey. - I didn't know who else I could call. God, what's wrong? I... I'm at the airport. I don't know what to do. I don't know if I should come back to Sydney or what I should do. I got no money. Julian... Let me just ask you one question. Are you filming this? Like, right now, are you filming this? Yes. Oh... God. Shit. Okay. So let me just get this straight, you... You've just lost money, your film's ruined, you feel like you've been taken advantage of, and your first impulse is to call your ex-girlfriend from the airport and start filming yourself? Julian, it's not healthy to live your life like this. I had to do this. I told Ceara to do this. This is your Diamond Experience. Hey, bitch. Ceara broke you down. She pushed you and pushed you to get you to this moment right now, and you're still recording. - What are you... - Why do you think your family don't talk to you? - Are you filming me now? - Why do you think we broke up? Did you turn off the record? At some point, you've got to turn the camera off. This is your life. I did this for you. For years, I've had this compulsion to capture all these moments in the hope that one day it would add up to something. I turned my life into a bonfire just so I could film the flames. But I can't do it anymore. You can stop now. The only thing I can really say after all that is, thank you. Seriously, thank you. Hey, bitch. Yeah, he's doing good. He's been asleep for like 18 hours. Can I call you back? - Muah! - Hey. He'll be glad to see that. The most common question I probably get is, "Why do men want to be ruined?" And it's pretty simple. Guys want to be ruined, whether they know it or not, because on the other side of that destruction and Armageddon is Paradise. You're welcome. Until next week, this is Julian Shaw saying, "Adios."
