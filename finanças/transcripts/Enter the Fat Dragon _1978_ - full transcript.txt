This pork is not fresh. What? How can that be? Look, the colour has changed. It must have been here a long time! That's impossible. The health department won't allow us to sell meats that aren't fresh. Now listen. This is my land. Don't try to cause any trouble here. Or you'll suffer. Eat. Impolite guys. When I passed through Hong Kong a few days ago, I met... Bruce Lee? I met your uncle. He runs a food stall in Hong Kong. He hasn't got enough men. You're grown up now. Think about yourself; you can't spend all your time feeding pigs. You'd better go to Hong Kong to help your uncle. Since he needs someone to help him. Go immediately after your meal! I'm leaving, what about the pigs? That's easy. I'll handle them. Fatty, how can you piss in the street? I'm not! Go! I'm sorry. Excuse me, please open the door! Sorry, thanks! Thank you.

Alright, I'll pay you! - Thank you - What are you doing? Nothing, I'm getting it! That's more like it! Ah Lung, when did you arrive? This morning. Father asked me to come and help you. Help? You're as fat as a pig. Maybe you can help to eat! Come... Ko, let me introduce my nephew. Fatty, it's you? Yes. You two know each other? I met him upstairs today. That's fine. Ko. - He's just arrived, you'd better show him! - Okay, Uncle Hung. Well, have you found the lift? Waitress? Oh, are you already leaving? We could stay if you join us. Don't be silly. Hey, you guys have a big appetite! I have to clean up. - You're not gonna charge us! We only come here once a week. It should be on the house. You have to pay something. How about a discount? OK, then give me a bill and sign it and I can give it to my boss. How about it? You should be thankful we come here. We're good for business. Yes, I appreciate that and am glad you enjoy our food. However you should pay something. Sure thing, how about tomorrow? That's it then, bye bye! Lousy cheap little bastards, I hope you choke on it! Uncle. Smart? Get away! Ah Lung, go to sleep. I'll wake you at six tomorrow morning. At six? No! I used to get up at five to practice! Practice what? Something invincible? I won't bell you, just bathe! Chicken rice! Hey, I've got no rice! Our chickens are the most fresh! They received no injections! Eat. Fatty, where's my chicken rice? You've ordered this? Yes, I've been waiting! Alright, right away! Sorry, please wait a moment! Done. Why does it look like a mess? It's not, look. Like this, alright? No... Bring me another one! What's happened? He gave me a dish that people had left behind. Ah Lung, Siu Mei comes here frequently. How can you offend such a good customer? No, I haven't! Siu Mei, he's just arrived. Sorry! It's alright! Bring her a new bowl! That's more like it! Siu Mei! - Mr. Ko! - Ah Jan!

Ah Lung, this place has turned into a mess. We can't do business for the time being. Find yourself a job. Don't worry about me. I'll take you back first. Ah Lung! What a coincidence! You come to eat or to find us? I came to look for a job. I'm not working at Hung Kee now. That's why? Captain Wong! What's the matter? This is my friend. He's looking for work. Ream?

Who cares then? Please. Do me a favour. Please don't! Get out! Man, that's all for today. Remember, where ever you are, I can handle you. Go. You want to go the police? Ah Lui, drive the car to your boss. I'll wait for you here. Miss, please watch it for me. Good morning, chief manager. What will you do now? I'll have to repair it. Ah Mei! Take some coffee to the conference room. - Right away. Good morning, boss. Your problem is, you let them do what they want with you. You have to fight them back. Or they will make it worse. I'll see you later. I can't fight those guys, what should I do? Now I'm here, let me take care of it! Don't be afraid. Is it that white car? This car is very beautiful. Is it new? Very beautiful indeed. Don't you have a friend? This is for him. I did this. What can you do about it? Right, these guys only oppress the kind men. This glass is very beautiful.

You should go home now. Yes. - I'll give you a lift. - Good! Well. Has our manager gotten a new car? My mother in law sent it to me. Have a look! Is it a white car? How do you know? Look! What? The sunlight! There's no sun. Open it! That'll cost a lot to repair it. Yes, you each earn 500 dollars a month. How long will it take you to repay the cost? Five hundred dollars a month Don't count. It takes at least a year. A Year! Tell them they have to compensate it. Fatty, this car belongs to our Chief Manager. That's fine! Boss, it's alright. I can handle him. You can go now. Ninth Uncle! Any information? I've just received a call from South Korea. They want 10,000 bottles of wine and 5,000 watches. This could be a big deal. But we haven't got enough capital. Get the goods ready. I'll get the money. Yes. Ninth Uncle, I've just heard something. Professor Pak, an antique collector, has just arrived in Hong Kong from the Middle East. What does this have to do with me? He's a billionaire. We can't sell some false antiques to him. Maybe we can earn something. But he has got three top fighters with him. They're all fierce guys. Among the three, one of them is a black person. He is a 7th Dan in karate. In Hong Kong, he has a gymnasium. Another is Chinese. His kung fu.. Has reached the supreme position. He is really mighty. And fighting 10-20 persons at the same time wouldn't be any problem to him. The third one is a white person. He is practicing Western and Thai boxing. He once acquired the European Championship title. How can you arrange to bring him to our shop? Ninth Uncle. Money can make everything happen. I've been your subordinate for so long. Of course I can handle such a little thing. I've already bribed his driver. Tomorrow, he will bring him to our shop. Professor Pak, how do you do? It's my honour to meet you today. Please, have a look around. Get the tea. Professor, have a drink first. This is a famous brand of Chau Tea. Pack it up. Boss, I want to buy this set. How much? Buy?

You have nothing that attracts me. The best ones are at my house. Maybe I'll prepare a party for you tomorrow. And I'll invite a few experts to join us. Good! Excuse me. - That's alright. Professor! Hey, you see that strange guy over there? Who do you mean? He seems to be very famous, watch your mouth! What do you mean? Am I strange? What are you talking here. Why don't you work?
