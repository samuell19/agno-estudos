Oh, stubborn, eh? [CHUCKLES] Ooh! Oh, yeah? I'll close this thing. People think I don't know what I'm doing, eh? Hey, how are you gonna open--? With these helpers, I'm helpless. Get the nails out of there, you nitwit! [CHUCKLES] [PHONE RINGS] I'll get it. Ooh! Hello? The boss? Just a second. It's for you. You dope. Ye Olde Furniture Shoppe. Moe Howard speaking. Oh, Miss Scudder, how's every little thing? Well, not so good, Mr. Howard. You promised to deliver my furniture two weeks ago. I have three new boarders moving in today, and I've simply got to have that furniture. Now, don't worry your pretty little head. We'll have all your stuff there before sundown. That's a promise. I hope you're not mad at me, Miss Scudder, because I think you're just about the cutest bunch of curls I've ever seen. [GIGGLES] Yeah, you know something, Miss Scudder? You're just my type. Hey, Moe-- Shut up! Not you, Miss Scudder. How's about you and I having dinner tonight? I know a place where they turn out a nifty cheeseburger. Hey, Moe. Mm! Put on your best bib and tucker. I-- [GRUMBLES] [GROWLS] [HISSES] Yeah, we'll do the town. Don't forget, kid, we've got a date. No, you ain't. Look. Why didn't you say something? Ooh! Hey, weasel brain, change jobs with this buttonhead. Go on. [BONES CRACK] Oh! Well, goodbye, Miss-- [GROANS] Boy, glue those boards together. What do you know? I've been promoted. Yes, sir. Take over. I want that board smooth enough to dance on. Right. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! [GROANING] When I want a haircut, I'll go to a barbershop. Ah! [GASPS] How do you like that? I drew a blank. [BOTH LAUGH] Ah! That's no blank. Here, go stuff a mattress. I don't want no more trouble with you. Go ahead. Camel's-hair brush? Hm. Must be the hump. Glue. And you did it. Now you get it open. I can't. Okay. Hold this. Ooh! Okay, open your eye. I still can't open it. Do something about it. Hey, this is pretty serious. Hey, Larry, bring the chisel. The what? The chisel. What do you want with it? Go on, drop it. Get some proper tools here. All right... Get this eye open or I'll annihilate you. Hey, take it easy. Now, we know what we're doing. Oh! Oh! Oh! Don't make any noise. You make me nervous. I'll make you nervous. Come on, get this eye open before I murder you. There's a way, there's a way. Steady. Oh! How was that? Pretty good. Why-- Get that brush off. Oh, yeah, yeah. Steady. Steady, now. Just take it easy. Put your hand up. It's stuck. Hold your hand up there. Let me get it. [GRUNTING] Oh! Oh! Are you all right, Moe? No. He's stuck again. Yeah, with you guys. Ooh! Oh! Get this thing off or I'll murder you. All right, all right. Don't get excited. Get a hammer. What are you guys gonna do? We'll get it off. There's only one way. We know. All right, now, come on, get back here. Give me a hand. Okay, there. What are you gonna do? Oh! Oh! Oh! That won't do it. That won't do it. I'll get something else. Go ahead. Attaboy, there it is. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! What, is it dull? I'll murder you. All right. Here, this might do it. [CREAKING] Oh! We did it. Oh, that's it. What do you know? [ALL LAUGH] Oh! Oh! Oh! [GRUNTING] Well, the furniture's beautiful, but I-- I wanted it stained dark walnut. Oh, don't give that a thought. We'll do the job right here. Hey, bean brain, open up that walnut stain. Well, I hope you do a good job. We sure will. You won't recognize the stuff. Oh, Miss Scudder, I'm sure glad about you getting them boarders. Oh, I can use that money, all right, with my tax bill coming due. I almost had to sell the family heirlooms. Oh, Mr. Pent! Pipe down. What's going on in there? It's just the men with the furniture. They won't disturb you. They'd better not. Me and my friends like complete quiet, and we don't like strangers. [PHONE RINGS] That's for me. I'm expecting a call. Hello? Yeah, speaking. Beat it. Okay, Steve, what's the dope? The jewelry store deal went off okay, Jerry. Boy, you should have seen that old guy shake with the gat in his ribs. Never mind reminiscing. Grab a cab. I'll wait for you here. [CUCKOOING] Hm. Loafing on the job, eh? What do you mean loafing? I gotta finish painting the cuckoo, and he won't be out again until 4:00. I'll take care of that. [CUCKOOING] Hm. I'll move it to 12:00 and paint him from head to toe. Never mind. We got a real job on our hands with that table. Come on. [GRUNTS] [CUCKOO SPITS] How do you like that? He gave me the drippings. All hands to the table. Aye, aye, ho! Hands to the table! Come on, get around. LARRY: Hands on the table. Get around here. SHEMP: Right here. All right, all right. Here, get that off the table. We got a job to do. All right, I'll go with the grain. Right. Hey! Uh-- Oh, quite unintentional, old boy. Yeah, well, watch it. That goes for you too-- What's the matter with you? [CLUCKS TONGUE] Mm! Oh! That's the way you-- [GRUNTS] Why, you... Does my head look like hardwood? Well... Ah. I didn't say it did. Well, you thought it. Well, I'm sorry, Moe. Will you shake hands? Okay. Again. Heh. Well... What's the matter with you? Clean up that face. All right. Clean yours up. You boys have been working so hard, I thought I'd fix you a bite to eat. Oh, that's wonderful, Miss Scudder. Oh, boy, eats. Let's knock off. We ain't got time. We gotta eat while we work. Come on. Now this time, for a change, get some stain on the table. Hey, imbecile, don't you know what you're doing to my coffee? Oh, I'm sorry. Here, take mine. I don't use it. [SPITS] [SPITS] [SPUTTERING] Clean me up on the double. What did you do, you...? Clean me up. Here you are. Don't worry. Don't worry your little pretty head. There, we'll-- Wait a minute. Wait a minute. [SNICKERING] [CHUCKLING] Oh! Oh! Get out of here. Go on, finish up that table while I clean off this mess! You imbeciles, you. Uh-oh. I wonder how the third race came out at Jamaica. RADIO ANNOUNCER: Flash. Two armed bandits held up employees at the Hendrix Jewelry Store and escaped with loot estimated at $50,000. A $5000 reward is offered for information leading to the capture of the two men. Five thousand dollars? That's right. One man is 6'2", heavily built and has a scar on his left cheek. The other is of medium height and weight, age about 30, and wore a brown suit and hat. One moment, please. Six-foot-two, heavily built, and a scar on his left cheek. Oh, if I could only get my hands on him. Hi. Get away from there. Bump them off, Steve. I think they're a couple of flatfeet. No, go get Jerry. I'll take care of these guys. They try any tricks, let them have it. Now, behave yourself and you won't get in any trouble. SHEMP: Hey, you better not-- Shut up and sit down. LARRY: Oh. We've enjoyed our brief stay here, Miss Scudder. And thanks for the tip about the family heirlooms. Ah! How you guys--? Oh, what's the big idea, always sitting down? Here, take this scraper. Stick 'em up. Nyah! Whoa! [BOTH WHIMPERING] [GUNSHOT] Hey, you! Whoa! Whoa! Come on, hey, we're in a nest of crooks. Come on! Get out of the way! [ALL SCREAM] [STOOGES WHIMPERING] Move it. Hey, wait a minute. Don't use that. It's got a crack in it. Here. [BOTH GRUNTING] [SIZZLING] [BOTH GRUNTING] Aah! Oh! Oh! Oh! Go ahead. Oh! Go around the other way. Hey, head them off. Ah! Out of the way, sister. [SIZZLING] [SCREAMS] Aah! [WHIMPERING] [GRUNTS] Ow! [LAUGHS] Oh! Moe! Oh! [ALL GRUNTING] Aah! Ah! Wait. Congratulations. Ha-ha! See if anybody's there. Ow! He's alive! Aah! You know, you shouldn't have-- I'm sorry, Moe. I didn't mean it. Speak to me, kid. Speak to-- STEVE: Horn in, will you? MOE: Cut it out. STEVE: I'll teach you. This'll fix you. MOE: Oh! Ow! LARRY: Ow! Hey! Oh! Hey! Oh, you're killing me. Cut it out. MOE: I'm a citizen. LARRY: Stop it. Help! Shemp! Help! [KNOCKING] MOE: Police! [LARRY GROANS] MOE: Hey! LARRY: Oh! MOE: What's the matter with you? Where are they? LARRY: Hey! Oh! Hey! Whoa! Oh, there they are! One side, coppers. We're getting out of here. [ALL GRUNTING] MOE: All right, clean up the mess. Go on, get up out of there. Oh! What are you doing here? We got the sparklers right here. There's another skunk in that room. [LAUGHING] Oh, you boys were wonderful. I wouldn't say that. Just excellent. I was great, wasn't I? You? Hey. Get out. We really didn't need the cops. All I had to do was pull this here rope. Oh, I'm sorry, Moe. Oh, Moe. I'm sorry. You're sorry. Yeah. Wait a minute. Get out of here, or I'll crown the both of you. Wait a minute-- Oh! [♪]
