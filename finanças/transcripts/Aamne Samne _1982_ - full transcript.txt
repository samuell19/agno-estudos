Say what you want, but our stars are connected. - All the schemes we've thought of... - All were sucessful. Do you know why? Because when I think of a scheme I think of kissing success. Again? Are you ever satisfied? Has anyone ever been satisfied with success? And I always want to be on... So that I can get the world's wealth in my pocket as soon as possible. What will you do with so much money? I'll buy all the happiness. And then I'll hug my success and live in it's arms forever. Oh, stop. Did you speak to Rekha in the same tone? Rekha? That was a dream... A day dream... Almost 5 years before today. I was running away from the police. He was right here, where did he go? Look for him everywhere! My life is in danger, some goons are looking for me. I should go! Rekha, your empathy saved me from the enemies. Your care has lead me to heal quickly. And in these few days, you have taken over my heart. So much that even if I want to go... You will leave? No, I can't leave you, I could never leave you. A few days later we got married too. And the night I got to know, I'm going to be a father.. That night... - Who is it? - Police! I stopped to think if I should leave or no? And without a second thought I left Rekha. That was the last time I saw Rekha. Why? You didn't meet her again? I did go back. But I got to know, she left the house and shifted. I looked everywhere, but,... - But? I found you... Get up, child. My mom's medicine fell down. She is very ill! I don't even have money for more medicine. Jack? Yes, Sir? Give it to the child, and let's go! Okay, Sir. Here you go, child. Buy new medicine. Maa, I got the medicne. I got all the medicines. Good boy... You returned before I left. Where are you going, Maa? Very far, son, a place from where no one returns. Waht about me? I'll be all alone. Son! Son, get me that. That photo of God? Maa, who's photo is this? Your father. My father? Maa? Maaa? Wake up, Maa? Open your eyes! Maa? Maa? The Government has stopped Rs. 1000 notes. These notes as as good as waste paper. This government policy has put us in a loss of 20 million rupees. How will we cover the loss, Sir? It's going to take 2 years to save 20 million. For others, for Johnny, it's just 2 days. Have you thought of some scheme? Rita, Johnny never talks without thinking. There is news. 2 days later, the treasure of Hamaliya Estate's King, is coming to Bombay for an auction. But we will rob it before it reaches Bombay. How? There will be a lot of security, won't there? And to face the police out in the open is impossible. Nothing is impossible for Johnny. Johnny does exactly what he thinks of. Even after our Police department and the State for help.. ..we still don't know the murderer of gaurds and the robber of the treasure. We should be ashamed that when this was asked in the assembly, we didn't have an answer. But, Sir? I'd like to yet again look at the confidencial file. The one with the famous singer and dancer, Johnny. Just by writing a name in a file, you can't accuse an innocent man. You can doubt me too. But you definitely need proof. Has any officer ever found any proof on Jhonny? And Johnny is a rich and famous man. Why will he do something like this? It could be possible that his songs and dance are a facade. And the reality could be entirely different. But this arguement still doesn't give us the proof we require. Anyway... I have called you here to give you'll very important information. To handle this case, a CBI officer from the Central government will be coming. And it will be your duty to help them. His name is Mr. Aslam Khan. May I come in? Yes, CBI officer, Mr. Khan? Please come, I was waiting for you. I've heard you left behind the city of the Rajdhani and are here in Bombay now? What's Delhi, people come from all over India to meet the famous Johnny It's a pleasure to meet you. I have heard a lot about you. A name is made from the work you do, Johnny. Anyway, why have you called me here? What's in the reasons, just think of it as an excuse to meet you. Cheers to this pleasant evening. No, thank you. I want to take the pleasures of this meeting. As you wish. Also, I've heard that you have come to look for a very dangerous criminal, in Bombay. That has always got away from you. He doesn't have a lot of time. But to be honest, it's the wish to see you live on stage that got me here. I'm an open book, Sir. They watch, or read. And the smart ones understand. You're right. Mr. Khan, next Sunday, my troop is doing a show. I request you to be the Chief Guest of this show. This show is for the Relief Fund for widowed Policer officer wives. It's a good deed, don't say no. Only on the condition, that when I call you, you will not refuse. - Sure. - Promise? Promise. Today's programm will have this music. And in the last part, after the 4 beats of the drum, here's 2 bangs of the cymbol. - Cymbol's... Right. - 2 bangs. And you have to shoot at the second bang. So that the noise of the bullet is drowned by the music. Okay, Sir. And, you should know, that Johnny thinks every opportunity is the last opportunity. Gurnam knows his work well, Sir. The bullet will directly go throug the CBI officer's head. Listen to this once more. Thank God, Mr. Khan. The bullet just missed you. Yes, I got saved. We could say that your bullet saved me. No, no one has been able to dodge my bullet. See, that's the dead body. But my bullets are reserved for the enemy. You have a very good understanding of friends and foes. Thank you. This revolver? I have a liscence. Naturally. That's why you have it with you, even on the stage. Do you also have threats from enemies? Don't worry. You are now a friend. It's my responsibility to protect you. Thank you. Send the body for postmortem. Okay, Sir. The chap lost his life. But whoever is behind all of this, I'll get him soon! By the way, your game... I mean your show was very nice. Thank you. Good night. If not Johny's bullet, Gurnam would have been killed by the police. And if he'd get arrested, then we all would be in danger. I'm saddened by Gurnam's death, but such a mistake can't be forgiven. Anyway, today the International Organisation's Chief, Supremo, is in Bombay. I have an appointment with him. If we get a chance to work with Supremo, we'll have a profit of millions. - Good luck, Johny. - Thank you. - Good luck, Sir. - Thank you. Good morning, Supremo. Tell me, what can I do for you? Johny, after a background check on you, the Supremo has decided,.. ..if you want, you can be the Indian agent for our International Organisation. I am honored. But this is unfair to me, Supremo. - I have worked so long for the organisation.. - That was your second mistake. And Supremo never forgives 2 mistakes. So you agree to my offer? Yes, Supremo. Good. Today onwards, you belong to our organisation. Thank you. Every agent needs to morgage gold worth 10 million with the organisation. When can you give it? I'll have it ready by tomorrow. Not tomorrow. You will recieve a message in a few days. The Organisation will give you 10% commision and expenditure for your manpower. Thank you. Remember one thing, the punishment for mistakes is... Honesty in business and intelligence in work, could make you Supremo, one day. Thank you. Johny! The door is this way. Johny never goes back on the same road he came from. I'm sorry... - Mr. Khan? - Hello. You, here? Everything okay? Don't worry, Johny, I still don't need a coffin. Right, you bother more about other people's coffins. Onlyt of criminals. And I'm quite infamous for it too. Often instead of going through an arrest.. ..prefer to lie in a coffin and sleep forever. They must be really lucky. - I just can't fall asleep. - Really? Yeah... You will be able to. Stop running around. I want to, Mr. Khan. But can't help it, people like you can't stop following me. And you know, I have to take care of others more than myself. So, I shall take your leave, today is Martyrs Day. I'm going to pay my respects to the Martyrs. And you too. Should i take flowers for you? No thanks, Mr. Johny. My martyrs are of a different kind. So are my condolences. Aren't you getting late? Absolutely. I want to do a lot in life, Mr. Khan, but time is too less. I sometimes wonder, if instead of one, I was two Johnys. You'd probvably have more trouble. But don't worry, God didn't make another Johny. - Which seeds are you sowing, Gopi? - I don't know, kaka (uncle). Lord told me to sow, I'm sowing. This is 'kost'. Is the new owner trading canabbis? That's a crime, kaka. Yeah, according to the law, it's a crime. But so what? We have to do our labour. No, kaka! If we get caught, the police will put me behind bars. Hey, Bholu, ratna, Puttu! Look what he's saying! This won't do' Kaka. What are you doing, Gopi? Are you going to rebel against the lord? Why shouldn't I? Lord Ram said, 'those who help robbers, are robbers'. I will not do this. Get back to work everyone, the Lord is coming. No body move. We will not do this illegal trade in our village. What is happening here? Why has the work stopped? - I stopped the work, Sir. - Why? You're making us sow cannabis instead of mustard seeds. Why? - Who does this farm belong to? - You. Who paid for the fetilizers and seeds? You did. Whose servant are you? Yours. And you dare to argue with me? Sir! Asshole! I'll sow you in the ground instead of these seeds. Gopi! Gopi! Gopi! Get up, child. Get up. Move aside, old lady! Sir! Let him go, I beg you let him go. I apologize if he's done anything wrong. Let him go, Sir. Sabu, suspend him for a month! His brains will work then! Everybody get back to work. Useless idiots. Get back to work everyone! How many times to tell you, Gopi, don't interfere in other's matters. But you just don't control your tongue. Shouldn't I speak up for injustice? No! Justice and injust is God's decision. He gives punishments and justice. then why was I punished without any crime? Our only crime is, we are poor. This world is for rich people. Those who have money are the ones that have the world at their feet. Are you saying money has all the power? Yes, they believe money to be their God. Okay, Grandma. One day I'll become God. - What are you saying? - I'm telling you the truth. I swear on these wounds on my back, I'll become rich. One day, I'll have the whip and the Lord will be getting hit. I'm telling you, don't go. There is nothing in the city. No, Grandma. Now that I have made my decision, I won't change it. I'll find something to do once I reach the city. Isn't it? - Yeah, yeah. And as soon as I get a job, I'll get you a... A daughter in law, right? Yes, grandma. The train is about to leave, I'll go. - Give me your blessings. - Yes, yes. Go carefully. You take care of yourself! Gopi, take care of all your money. Don't use it in front of anyone. I have packed food, eat that if your hungry. Go to the temple when you reach the city. And don't do anything wrong, my son. Grandma, I swear, I won't do anything wrong. You take care. Go. why are you crying? Don't worry. I'll write you a letter as soon as I reach the city. God, he's an orphan. Please protect him. Oh lord, Sukhi was right. Looking at houses here, a person's hat could fall off. Hey, Lord Ram, beware! It's not far that these people will come live in your house. Where did my luggage go? Sir? My... That is a madam. Forgive me, I was mistaken. Sorry. Saree? She isn't wearing a saree. What kind of city is this. She forgot her saree home and she's asking me for it? My luggage is robbed. Did you see 'Barsat Ki Ek Raat'? - Yup. Did you like it? - I liked it. - I loved it. I think I'll have to go hungry today. Funny chap, man. Father? Dad? Dad? Dad? Wake up. Who are you? I am your son. Son? Ramji, what kind of city is this! Listen, I am not yet married. How am I your father? Son, I am not your father. If your not my father why are you calling me son? I know everything, you got angry at mummy and went away. Who is Maami? My mother. She always cried. She said you would come, but you never came, daddy. - And she left. - Left? Where did she go? To god. She was very ill and he died. While dying, Maa said, look for your father. I looked for you everywhere, dad, but couldn't find you. See, I walked so much, even my feet became small. Dad, please don't leave me. No, son. We both don't have anyone in this town. Nobody loves me, dad. Will you love me? - Yes. - Everyday? Take me home. Home? I am very hungry. Even I am hungry. Son, what's your name? Don't you know my name is Raju? Look, Raju, I have lost everything in this city. All my luggage got robbed. I don't even have 10 pence. If you don't have 10 pence, here, I'll give it to you. Son, we won't get any food for 10 pence. No problem, I'll stay hungry with you, I have a habit of staying hungry. Just don't leave me. I won't ask for anything, not even bread. Whatever God wants. Look, Raju, it seems like even God is hungry, today. There are no offerings in the plate. But don't worry, I'll get some food for you. You sit right here. I'm also coming, otherwise you'll leave me again. No, son, no. I won't leave you. I swear to God. I will never leave your side. You sit here. Come soon. Yes, son. I'll come soon. Maa, see I found my dad. Now, I don't need this. Here, God. Now, you take care of this. Hail Lord Ram! How long is this Johny going to make us wait? I'll wait all my life if he comes only for me. - It's taking a lot of time. - Who knows what happened. Ma'am? Johny? You? Johny! Johny! Johny! Johny! Is someone getting married? Yes, you to me. Will I get some food? Yes, definitely. - You joke so much. - Yeah, I love to joke. Excuse me? Mr. Johny? This is such a surprise. Johny? Who is Johny? My name is Gopi, Gopi. We are all your Dasis. Please come in. I don't have any money. Please come in. - Inside? - please come. Take this, we are going in. Take this, now cut the ribbon. - After I cut this will I get food? - Yes. Why do we need a scissor? Here you go! Oh Lord Ram! What was that, lightning? You are giving out lighting to my heart. I swear to Lord Ram, I didn't do anything. It happened on it's own. My name is Jyoti. Jyoti, please show me the way. Raju is waiting for me, we are very hungry. Who is Raju? He's probably calling Raj Kapoor, Raju. Come. Oh Ram, it's so decorated. It's great. - It's all for you... Come. - For me? This way. It's beautiful. Sit. Please sit. You promised you will eat with me. If you say so, then I'll eat both my meals with you. But not today, Raju is waiting for me at Ram mandir. But we wnat to hear you sing. - Sing? You want me to sing to Lord Ram? But haven't you heard? No one can sing when hungry. I'm calling from Mr. Johny's office. His flight from Delhi is delayed.. ..and he won't be able to come for the restaurant opening. What? What are you saying? Mr. Johny is sitting right here. He's sitting there? Yes! And for your kind information, the Restaurant has been inaugrated. Strange. May be he landed and directly went there. Mac, take the car to Golden Gate for Johny. No, no, not me! All those songs are from movies. - But I was Seeta in Ram Leela... - Here you go. It smells brilliant. I'll take your leave. Thank you very much. If I come tomorrow, will I get food? No! No? Tomorrow, you'll have to sit here and eat with me. No problem, I'll sit with you and eat. For how long will this marriage go on? It's just started, you have to take it upto mariage.

Sir, let's go down. Why down? Why not up? Sir, please. - Okay, come Raju. - Sir, let him rest here. Okay. You take good care of him. Raju, I'll be back. Woah! That was a miracle. I don't understand, is it a door in the wall or a wall in the door? Please. Come. This way. It's quite grand. Why is there such a big mirror in the way. Move this. What sorcerry is this Ramji? Where have I come? What kind of city is this? People rob luggage and faces too? Brother, are you me or am I you? I am Johny. You are? Gopi. I have come from the village. To look for a job. So, now you have a job. Wow, Lord Ram. What do I have to do? You will have to become Johny. What do you mean? God has given both of us the same face. But our behaviors and charecteristics are very different. We'll have to get rid of these differences. Which means, there iwll be no difference between you and me. Hey, there is no sin in making these differences go, right? Look brother, I have promised my Grandma, I will not do anything sinful. Which means you are a truthful person. You are religious? And you believe in God? Absolutely. I'm a Ram bhakt. (Lord Ram's Desciple). Then you will have to help me. I'm doing a selfess job for a friend of mine. What? Gopi, I want to make a fertilizer,.. ..which will allow 12 times the crop yeild. 12? You mean a new yeild in every month? Yes. I want to get rid of hunger and poverty from the nation. You hurry up! I'm with you. Gopi, if the enemies of our nation find out about this fertilizer,.. ..they'll kill me and take it to their land. And our Country will remain hungry and poor. That's why i want to hide my work. But if i don't meet my fans, friends, my people.. ..they will start to doubt things. - So.. - So until then I should become Johny. But brother, how will I become Johny? Rita, turn Gopi to Johny within a month. Okay, Johny, I'll become johny. But my Raju has to stay with me. All the arrangements will be done. But even i have one condition. Tell me. What is the most dearest to you? That... That is my Grandmother. She lives in the village. So swear on Grandma, you will not tell anyone. Done. I swear on Grandma, I'll die but not tell anyone. One more thing. We'll both live in the same house, you live upstairs and me here, down. But when we leave the house we have to inform each other. At one time, only one of us can be outside. Understood. Start training him. Rita! That's Gopi! Not Johny. How could you be mistaken. Wow, Gopi! That was brilliant. Oh, Shut up, Gopi! I'm Johny. - Yes? - No, It's impossible. Nothing is impossible for Johny. Come, Rita. Come on, Rita, I am Johny. Come on, Rita, come on, I am Johny. Oh, Johny! Hello? Hello? Can I speak to Mr. Johny? I am Jyoti. Hey, Jyoti, how are you? I have still not forgotten the food from your hotel. And me? It seems like you forgot me. How can I forget you, you helped me when I was hungry. But you said, you'll come everyday to eat. Okay then, if you want, I'll reach right away. Okay, even I'm reaching the hotel in 10 minutes. Okay, I'll see you there. See you. - Bye. - Bye. Doctor, I can't see anything! - Jyoti? - Doctor? Why it so dark? Jyoti? I'm really sorry Miss Jyoti, because of a fall, your optic nerve is damaged forever. Doctor? Will she not be able to see? No. What are you doing? You will have to stay at the hospital for 2 weeks. Inspector, you can take a statement. Miss Jyoti, I'm Sub Inspector, Rane. You can give me a complaint against Mr. Johny, I'll take it down. No, Inspector, I'm to be blamed for this accident. Mr. Johny is not at fault. Miss Jyoti, the police has filed a case against Mr. Johny. Your statement is very important to us in the court. No, I don't want to give a statement. Are you threatened by anyone? threatened? No. Then why won't you give a statement. It's her choice to give a statement or not. You can't force anyone to give a statement. And then th ewhole city knows, Johny is a good man. He didn't purposely have this accident. Am i right, Miss Jyoti? Yes. This accident was my ill fate. Please let the patient rest. Sure, doctor. Come, Inspector Rane. It was my fault, Jyoti, why didn't you tell the inspector? Would that get my eyesight back? Forget what happened. Did you have an accident? yes. A girl crashed into my car. Why didn't you tell us? Why? What would you do? I had taken her to hospital. You know, she lost her eyes. I was responsible for a girl becoming blind. with these demonic hands... Johny, that girl has no one. And I have decided to bring her here. She will live with me. Gopi, this is a house! It's not a hotel or hostel. Hey, it's impossible for you to stay here with that girl! - Rita, no! - Yeah, kill me! I don't want to stay here. you told me tobe Johny, if you want I'll leave and go to my village. No, gopi. I'm happy, the first time I saw a shadow of Johny in you. Keep it up, boy. Keep it up. Thank you, doctor. I'm indebted to you. You took really good care of me. Where will you go? Let the hospital car drop you. Today the hospital car will help, but all my life I'm on my own. Here you go. This is the same stick right? Red and white. The eye for the blind. Thank you. - This is not required, Doctor. - Johny? Yes, Jyoti. I can't take back the mistake I made. But if youcan take me as your life support, I'll be indebted to you. Come. Come, Jyoti. This is our home. And from now on you will live here. What is this place? This is the hall (living room). Right opposite that is the dinning room. This way, that is the left, is my room. And here, on your right, is a staircase, that goes straight to the library. And Jyoti, there are so so many books there... Books? I used to love to read. I'm sorry, this is all my fault. Good day, Sir. Rita? This letter came from the Punchgani school, Raju has got the admission. School starts next monday. Good. thank you. Come, I'll show you your bedroom. Who was this girl? My secritary, Rita. And who is Raju? You can say he is my son. What do you mean? I'll explain later. Come. This is your bedroom. And this room is on the left as soon as you climb the stairs. Sit. Raju? Why are you hiding? Come, meet aunty. No i feel shy. Why are you shy? Come. I'm not wearing clothes, she'll see that. No, Raju, I can't see anything. Yes, Raju. Aunty lost her eyes in an accident. Oh! Can't you see anything? No. It's okay aunty, don't worry. I'll always stay with you. I'll take good care of you. That's very sweet Raju. You are very sweet. You are also very sweet and beautiful. Will you be friends with me? Yes, definitely. Come, Raju, let's wear our clothes. Give, I'll do it. Give it, Raju and I are now friends. Daddy, why are you silent? No, I'm not. - aunty, why are you silent? - No. I know everything. What do you know? Daddy, you love aunty. Say what you have to, but it's not right for Gopi to keep that girl here. I know. But I have put a lot of money on him. Let me get my profits and then see me destroying Gopi. As it is, she is blind. She won't know what we are doing. - Hello? - Speak to the Supremo. Hi, Supremo. Good day. - You were supposed to give the treasure. - Yes! You can take it now. - Where? - Near the swamp at Monkey Hill. What's in it? The King's treasure woth Billions. I see. Sorry Johny. You are definitely smart, but the state gaurds are smarter. This is false. How is it possible? So many gaurds and security? It's to fool smartasses like you. When you were robbing the fake treasure, the king transferred it to the right plac. Think of another scheme Johny. I want to see you progress to billions. I'll give you one more month's time. There is one way. After 12 years, next week, on Janmastrami, a Krishna voyage is happening. If you get me that idol, I'll give you your freedom. Best of Luck. Hello? Hi, Rita. Johny had to go to the opening of Lion Musical Festival, but he's busy. So you go immediately. Okay. I'll be therein 10 minutes. See you, Rita. Are you going out? Yeah, I should be back in half an hour. Isn't it raining outside? Yes. Wait, let me get your coat. I'll be back in sometime, Bye. I believe, you all have understood our voyage scheme. Yes, Sir. - Any questions? - no, sir. There, Gopi is home. Now, we can go. Let's go, Rita. - Hi! - Hey, you're back. Your coat? I'll just get it. If everything goes as planned,.. ...then next Monday, the Krishna idol worth 20 million, will be Johny's. My coat. Thanks. Good night. So everything is according to the plan. Next Monday, the Krishna idod worth 20 million rupees will be Johny's. Hello? Police headquarters? I'm CID officer, Jyoti. Next monday, Johny is going to steal the Krishna Idol. Yes, they still think I'm blind. Jyoti? Jyoti! - You're back? - Yes. Here, have this. And now I want something in return. Why something? Whatever belongs to me, is all yours. Tomorrow, there's a voyage, can you take me there? Why not? I myself was thinking of going. I knew you wouldn't say no. Okay, tell me this, what will you ask God for me? If God answers my prayers, then tomorrow you'll know. Judge, let the punishment be long, this prisoner wants to be imprisoned for life. In these arms. Hello? yes. Okay, I'll be there. I have some important work, I'll see you soon. Hi, Gopi. Tomorrow, you have to play snooker with the CBI officer Mr. Khan. No, no, I am taking Jyoti for the Krishna voyage tomorrow. Krishna voyage? She wishes to go, she wants to be a part of it. Gopi, my beloved mother's dying wish was for me to take part in the voyage. So you come along. But both of us? But I promised the CBI officer. Gopi, what if we take Jyoti to the Voyage with us? This fits. You go play snooker, while I pray and even Jyoti gets to go. Okay, work is worship after all. I'll play snooker with Khan. You go. Thanks, Gopi. - Rita, train Gopi with my best shots. - Okay. Let's go, Gopi. Game over! Johny, you one this one. But remember, everyone has to lose one day. - And that day you will see my targets. - of course I will and I'll praise it too. Only if the target is worth priasing. Shall I leave? May God be with you. - And you. Yes? Sir, this is Inspector Chopra, the idol has been stolen from the voyage. What? The idol was stolen? There is nothing to worry about. You probably don't know but after Inspector Jyoti's information, we placed a fake idol. Tell me who robbed it! Sir, Johny robbed the idol. What nonsense! You have either lost your mind or your eyesight is weak. Johnny was right here, playing snooker with me. Believe me, Sir. That was Johny, my bullet hit his leg, but he got away in a helicopter. Really? If your bullet hit the right place, tonight, there's a dance program, we'll see there. You're lucky, Johny. The wound is not deep. Rest today, you should be okay tomorrow. I'll cancel the evening show. No, Rita. this is the best time to fool the inspector. Tonight, you will go with Gopi for the show instead of me. And you know very well how to take care of a show. - Good evening, sir. - Good Evening. What is it? It's time for the program. Yes, it's been 15 minutes but there's no trace of Johny. - He will come, Mr. Chopra. - He is hit by a bullet not a thorn. How will he come? - Hello. - Come in, Mr. Khan. Well done, Mr. Johny, you really had us awed. What a dance. Congratulations. Even I'm awed, I have so much pain in my legs and yet this program. I was probably scared of you and people thought I was dancing. Are you wounded? I don't know what it is. But it feels like a bullet went through. Yeah, I can walk now. Sir, there's a telegram for Gopi. Gopi's grandma is coming on the 13th. And tomorrow is the 13th. Gopi! Hey, Gopi? I'm here. Come, come. Hey, have you forgotten all your manners? Shouldn't you be touching my feet? I forgot. Stay blessed, be happy. You look like such a city man. We have to wear such clothes in the city, grandmom. What is this grandmom busines? Is something wrong? Obviously! Didn't you call me Grandma back in the village. - Grandma! Forgive me. - Live happily, my child. When you get such good clothes in the city, don't you get goo food? - Why? - You have lost weight. Don't be offended, Mr. Johny, the camera clicked itself when it saw you. Listen... - Cn I get a copy of that? - Sure, Sir. I'll come deliver it. Thank you, Sir. Come, Grandmom... I mean Grandma. Come, grandma. Is this your house? - Come. - Oh, Lord. Grandma, this is Ramu, he takes care of the house. And this is Shamu. He does the cooking. Son, you know I never eat what someone else cooks. I'll cook my own food. Okay, tell him whatever you want. Don't you live in this house. No, Grandma, I live here but I have to go out quite often. - OhGod! I am going I have a meeting. - Hey, listen. All of this is yours, right? Yes, grandma it's all mine. Listen, you aren't doing anything bad, are you? Your son can never do anything sinful, grandma. I'll go? Come back before sunset, okay? I will, but pray to god my work gets done. It will, son, it will. - What happened then? - What could happen? Once Grandmom became Garndma, your Johny was Gopi at Grandma's feet. Gopi? Johny, yesterday's danceshow was amazing. Even here something happened. What? Blind people somehow have eyes now. What do you mean? The light of your eyes, Jyoti, hasn't lost the light of her own eyes. She can see. She can see? How is that possible? You are definitely mistaken. Wouldn't I know if she wasn't blind? And why does she need to be blind? Even I want to know. Let's find out if she is blind or not. - Is the sea all around us? - Yes. No wonder there is so much breeze. Now, you just have to be in this breeze. What do you mean? Johny has bought this flat for you. Really? He never told me. Everything is not told in love, it's understood. Come. Come, take a step. As soon as your leg reaches the floor, you'll be in your own flat. Jyoti! What happened? You don't know what would have happened, this heartless people... Who heartless people? Johny and Rita! - They would have killed you. - My life isn't that cheap, Johny. - What do you mean? - I can see. And you are under arrest. You... Yes, I'm police Inspector, Jyoti, Johny. Police? Tell me, tell me where the idol is, which you robbed from the Krishna Voyage. Which idol? You don't have to lie, I saw you steal the idol. I saw you myself. I didn't steal any idol! And Jyoti, I'm not Johny, I'm Gopi, Gopi! And Johny,.. Come with me. See, look there, that's Johny. He's my look alike, he probably robbed the idol. Come with me. Good, Inspectpor Jyoti. even I reached on time. Come on, Mr. Johny. No, Mr. Chopra, he's not Johny, he's Gopi. He's Johny's look alike. What are you saying? Yes, I have seen him go in the car. I think, while acting blind, you became blind in love. And you want to save Johny? But we have an aresst warant for Johny. Hey, they are arresting Johny! Throw a smoke bomb. Arest them! Make sure he doesn't get away. Oh, so you helped him run away? What do you mean? The meaning is clear, Miss Jyoti. And I'm aressting you for the crime of helping a criminal get away. Your allegation is absolutely baseless. Yet, let's go! - But first, I'll meet CBI officer Mr. Khan. - Fine. Let's go. What you are saying can probably be the truth. But, Inspector Jyoti,.. ..you know well, that when we officers take a case, we get to the bottom of every doubt... And then take a decision. even I can't let you work on this case, until I get to the bottom of the allegations. For the time being, you are suspended. You can get on with your enquiries. But even I'll prove it to you, that Johny and Gopi are two different people! Come, Johny. Did you see how powerful Supremo's security is? If our men wouldn't reach on time, you'd be in jail. - And if the police found this idol,.. - Itr would be your second mistake, Johny. And you know the Supremo doesn't forgive 2 mistakes. We can't wait too long, tomorrow at 10 we'll wait for the idol on the Hill top. This is your last chance. - Hello? - Hi, Dad. Johny is giving us the delivery of the idol tomorrow. I had sent you his papers, did you get them? Yes, Dad. Johny? I know Johny quite well. His real name is Gopi. - Gopi? - Yeah! He worked in the canabbis fields of Ramgadh. That swine! If you're still there, the I'll come to Bombay. - Come. - Okay, see you, Dad. Johny! You thief, gangster! Trecherous bastard! What do you mean? Bastard! Where are the yields? Liar! Gopi! What's wrong with you? You do illegal things and then say, you're going to get rid of poverty! I swear to God! I'll kill you. JUst because I'm not hitting you doesn't mean... ..the meaning is just with the idol! Idol? What idol? What your supremo was asking for! Supremo? How could you rob from God! I'm going to go report it to the police and tell them about your deeds. Gopi? Do you want your grandma alive? Grandma? Yes. Look. Where is she? She's okay until now. If you want her safe, you have to do as I say. Now, tell me what did the supremo say. He will come at 10 at the hilltop to take the idol. Rita, the Supremo himself is coming to take the idol at 10 am tomorrow. I have made the arrangements. And I'll reach the hilltop on time. Good. - Hello, Supremo. - Hello. The key? Oh, I'm sorry. the key is in my purse, I'll get it. You wait here, I'll get the ball. What happened, son? What is it? - Tell me, tell me? - She, she... Don't be scared. Are you scared? Sit here. Hello? Johny? Raju, Gopi's son saw me put Supremo's body in the trunk. What is Raju doing there? I don't know, he must have come there for a school picnic. He's gone into someone's house here. Stay there, I'm coming. Here, child. Have some water. What is it, child? Why are you so scared? What is it? Is someone following you? In the jungle... car... Did you see a wild animal? In the car... - In the car? What? - Son? Daddy! - Is this your son? He's scared, I believe. - Yes, he is. I guess so too, anyway, thank you very much. She took the car back and dragged the body and put the man in the trunk. - Do you know? - I know everything, Son. What happened, dad? Nothing. You sit in the car, I'll... Is the body in the trunk? Leave the car for me, and take Raju. Gopi? Gopi! Gopi... Forgive me, Gopi. I cheated an innocent and nice man like you. I got you involved in bad things. I'm an ass, a bastard. God gave me my karma, Gopi. I'm not going to live for long. What happened to you? Cancer. The doctor's given me 3 months max. Gopi, I know I'm not worth your forgiveness. Still, help me complete my last wish. Take this, take it. These are my house keys. All my property, all the money, everything is yours. If you want, give it to the poor. This world is now alien to me. Johny? And your grandma, is in a cottage at Madh Island, it's called Kamal Kunj. Tell her... Touch her feet for me. And... Cottage? Kamal Kunj? But Johny, you need to see a good doctor. The best doctor, is God, Gopi. Since... What happened? Nothing. I'm reaping what I sowed. Grandma is dying to see you. Go, take my car. What about you? Don't worry about me, go! Go! - Gopi! - Grandma? - Gopi! My son. - Grandma? Gopi! Where had you gone? Forgive me, Grandma. What have you done? I came here to complete my goals. But what I thought would help me, turned out to be a viscious deed. Did you do anything wrong? No, no, grandma. I swear to you I wouldn't. I'll die but do anything wrong. - We are going back... just come. - Why? Sit. - We need to search your car. - Why? We have been told, you have murdered a man. What is this you're saying! Could you give me the car keys? What happened, son? Nothing, Grandma. They have a doubt... No! Ididn't do this. I didn't murder anyone, Grandma. Sinster! Murderer! You told me you don't do anything wrong! What is this? - I haven't done this, really. - You bad person! Tell me the truth! Why did you do this murder? No! My son can't be a murderer. My son can't be a murderer! Tell me! Grandma, I didn't do it. I didn't do it! I swear I haven't done this. I'm not a murderer, grandma! I didn't do it. I'll prove it! I'm not a murderer. Stop the car, there's dynamite ahead. Why? are you shocked at seeing me alive? Bastard! You sent a bomb instead of the idol! Where is the idol? The idol is not with me, it must be with Johny. I'm not Johny, I'm Gopi. I'm Johny's look alike. Don't you recognize me? Yeah, I know you well. You're Gopi! And you are Johny too! Tell us where the idol is! I don't have the idol. At least listenb to me. I really don't have the Idol. If you want it catch Johny! You can always kill me, I'm your prisoner! But at least look for johny! You are lying! I'm not lying! Monty, it's possible that he's saying the truth. What if Johny is another man? Go look for him! Rita! We are leaving the country, right away. - Where's the kid? - Inside. Listen, the police is after us. Remove everything from the locker and the idol and wait. I'll take care of this child in the meanwhile. - Okay. - Go! Dad, where had you gone? Open all this. Rita aunty tied me up. I'm untying you, son. This photo? How did it get here? I had kept it there, dad. You? Where did you get this? Mom gave it to me. Your mother? Yes, dad. She had said that's my dad. She said, "find him". And then she died. Son... Yes, dad. She would always think of you. My son? Son... My son... - Dad! - God saved me, my son. Or else I'd have killed my own blood. Johny! We've looked for you everywhere! Surrender yourself! Take the kid too! Come, come. Take a step. As soon as your feet touch the ground, you'll be in your flat. Let me take you to your new flat, I mean, a jail cell. Miss Rita, you are under arest. Give me the idol, and come with me. Stop!

I have a way to know who's who. Grandma? Tell me, Old lady! Which one is your Gopi? What do you think? My Grandma won't recognize me? Grandma! I'm your Gopi. See Grandma, see how they are hitting me.
