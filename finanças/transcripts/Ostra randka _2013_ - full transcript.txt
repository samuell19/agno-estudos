LOVE YOU BLOODY DATE -...photo of the murdered woman... - Leave the music on. ...massacred body of a young woman... Leave it! ...was found last Friday near highway A2. Gosia, you want some tea? Goska! Hey! Come on... Right. Moni, I asked you not to smoke in the bathroom. Gocha, stop worrying so much, will you? Turn it up. Hi, Moni. Hi. Girls, is there something to eat? Will you make me some breakfast? Witek, it's not a hotel. And you could put away these bottles. Moni, give him a break. He's cute, isn't he? - No? - No. He was to stay for two days and what? It's crazy. - Okay, Moni, move aside. - Relax. Kuba called. Hi, Goska, Grzesiek gave me a car till Sunday. Cool, yeah? - But I thought we'd go out. - But where? There's this Italian place at Wodna. It's close. And it's warm. Okay, but let's drive to the Market Square, we might go somewhere later. We won't sit there all night. Goska, wait a minute. - I'm back. - Kuba... We were to be together. Sure. What time are you finishing? At 6, but I'll try to get out earlier. Let's meet at 8, okay? Good. I'll come over and we'll talk. All right, I gotta go. See you then? Okay... I love you, bye. Hi. Sorry, Ela, I overslept. I'm leaving at 6, you'll have to stay. But... I've been sitting here since dawn. You'll take the keys. Ela, but today... I have a date. And I don't have a date. Ela. Or not, Gosia. Put the irises in fresh water. Yes, but I have a favour to ask. My grandma's coming tonight by train from Przemysl. And I only know her from letters, I have never seen her and... And? And what? She's an old lady and my only grandma. I thought... Could I make her a bouquet? A corsage? I'll pay for the flowers. Yes, when it's not busy. Now change the water and sweep the floor. - Pay half the price for the flowers. - Thank you very much. - Be quick or the owner will kill me. - Relax, it'll take a moment. We're always busy on Fridays and I have to stay till 8. The girls are leaving? - Well, yeah. - That's cool. We'll go to your place later? Okay. See you at 9 on the hill. It's that small Italian place with a garden. Not at the Freedom Square? - No, we'll walk. - All right, I'll be there at 9. -...for sexual purposes? - We're not ruling out any option. When Poland became part of the Schengen Area, our western borders were opened, and human traffickers use that... Hi, daughter. I'm calling now because I'm going out. With the girls? No, with Kuba. He invited me to dinner. Nice. Just be careful and don't stay out late. You can't be late for the train. Granny'll be tired after the journey. We're coming back Sunday night. Don't lose her stuff and be careful, you have a weak heart, too. Mom! You do, you must be careful. Mom, enough with that heart. When was that? Will you be okay? Yes, I'll call you once we're there. Don't worry. I'm in a hurry. I'll call you later. Love you, bye. Kuba, I'll be a little late, okay? No problem, I'm taking boys to the Market Square. All right. Bye. Hi. Sorry, I had to... refuel. - Are we going? - Can't we walk? Please... We'll go to the Dragon first, there's a party. It will be nice. Piotrek's there, Rafi from my class, you know them. Dana's back from London. We'll talk a little and go to where you wanted. Or straight to your place, okay? So Rudy left his transcript in the hall. And those guys put pieces of a tomato inside. But when he left the exam, he was so depressed that he didn't pass that he didn't even notice the tomato. Nothing! - That's fucked up. - An idiot. He takes it, gives it to Szablewska, her jaw falls down, and he's like entranced. And the tomato's dripping. I almost crapped my pants laughing. She was always pissed that I was wearing shorts. - Idiot. - But he passed, and you? Screw it, I'll be a top model. I've passed everything, I can still party. Next week we're going climbing, right? - Where Radek fell? - Idiots, again? Gosia, are you going with us? - Stop it. - I'll have more wine. Anyone? - A beer for me. - I'll be right back. Girl! Two. Excuse me! Excuse me, sir! - Sorry, you were first. - No, I've got one. Excuse me, sir! Bartender! Yes? Wine. Wine? - A glass of red. - Good. A moment. Thank you. - Double? - No, no. You've been coming to town a lot lately. Business. I've heard you're done with business. Done? I'm leaving with a woman. To Germany? You will know. A free drink for an old pal and get out. I don't need troubles. It's a club for regular people. - That's the past. - Yes? Police are after you. Don't come here. Lili's afraid of you. Interesting. Listen, a drunken oaf stands in front of a tower block and shouts: "Lesbian! Lesbian!" Then a window opens and a blondie says: "Isobel! Learn it finally." - Hello. - Hi! Hi. - I'm Dana. - Gosia. - Second year, too? - No, she's just started medicine. Kuba's new girl. Are you from Srem? - No, from Sieradz. - And not new. - From Sieradz. - From Kornik? That's why this dress. Sorry, but Kornik is nice. They've got beautiful... - Has anyone got a smoke? - Kuba. Kuba! Goska, what's wrong? I didn't tell you about the climbing. But it's not where Radek fell. You shouldn't be upset. It was an accident. You'll blame yourself till the end? What the fuck are you doing? They're my friends, you know them. The anniversary. We were to be together. What anniversary? Please, don't be childish. Sure. I must go to the toilet. You didn't use to be like this. I've been here since 6. I'm not going anywhere. Come in here. Just shut it later. Thank you. Everything fine? If he finds out, he'll stop us both. Then I'll blow his head off. Can you take some money from the till? Right, half an hour. I'll take you to the station. - You've got the tickets, passport? - I do. Tegel is about 40 minutes from Ostbanhof. Take a cab, wait for the check-in. The take off is at 10:20. You'll make it. I'll be there 9:30 the latest. Go now. I have one more thing to do. We need money for the start. One good hoax. One. Fucking great. I'll tell you all on the plane. Take care. - One more? - Yes. Wine too? - Yes, double. - No, thank you. Double. Is he your boyfriend? You are a beautiful woman. Stand up to him, make him care. Do you smoke? I'm sorry. No smoking here. Well? Boss, we've got a problem. They fucked it up. - Where's the goods? - There's none. Fuck! Wait for me. Put her in the bag and take her to the pond. Actually we've known each other for a long time, but we've been going steady for a year. Since I moved here with my cousin, because I started my studies. In general, I think you need to be nice to people and all will work out. Yeah... You really look beautiful. - Thank you. - Kuba, come on! Thanks for the wine. - One more? - No, I'm light-headed. Same here. Dana, I'm with Gosia. Agnieszka, remember the Old Town in July? It was raining like hell. We ran to some door... Yes, yes! - No, no... - Wait. Two Englishmen hid there two. One was even handsome. - And Agnes... - Please, don't! Oh, no. Bon vivant. Well, Kuba. Here's to the third year. We fuck around! We'll work in the fourth. Everything fine? Yes, I just felt dizzy. Need a ride? I've got a car. No, no... I've got a car. I live nearby, I'll walk. You can't walk alone at night. I'll give you a lift. And that lady in the bar. Is she your wife? Yes, my wife. Don't be afraid, you'll soon be home. Change of plans. Leave her. I'll clean up later. Take the equipment, we're moving. All right. Too busy to pick up... This is Lili. I can't pick up. Leave a message. Take a cab, go to the station. We'll meet at Tegel. You won't open a fucking beer can in this state. Done? - Done? - Yes. We're getting the fuck out of here? Is it okay? This time? Yes. Where's Anest? What happened before? The bitch was drunk. She freaked out after the sedative. She was struggling, so she got one and died. Tough shit. And the goods? You've got it? No... but I took it out okay. - And she's good? - Yes. All right. Pack it carefully. Set it for 35 degrees and wait till I go. Then get out quietly. But not through the reception, clear? - Yes. - You've got the card? And the girl? I'll clean up there and I'll be back. Stay here, don't let anyone in, watch her and make no noise. And pull the curtains. Kuba. She turned it off. She's offended. Don't worry, everything's fine. We're going! The taxi's waiting. Go, all right? We'll soon be there. See you later. We'll have more cash for beer. You're not driving? No, I've had too much. Bye, sucker. Come on, it's still early. Fucking bitch! What the fuck are you doing? Want me to smack you? I'm sorry... No! Please, no... Help! Yes, reception. Still, yes? I'm sorry on behalf of the hotel. We're practically empty, but it's the weekend, people are coming late. Best not to worry. Yes, we will check. - Good night. - Someone's making noise? What's up? Something wrong with the guests? No, all is fine. What's that? - I didn't notice. - Which room is that? I'll check and ask them to move right away... I mean in the morning. Please pay attention and remind them at once. Then they complain there's nowhere to park. Good night. Wait, wait... - it's your first time here. - I'm here every Friday. My eye! So come on, the ladies are waiting. Can you do that? You can. Hey, you're on her leash. - You're free to do anything. - You know me. So? You like her? Dana, I'll show you something. What are you doing? I don't know whose blue car this is. The boss will complain it's wrongly parked. Rewind, we'll see. Here? Press twice and you can rewind. And slow motion? Press reverse and push this one forward. Shall we call security? No, Rafal's on duty, he's always asleep. And when he gets up, he logs "intervention on demand". Is the bar open? Sorry, not any more. - The key to 207 then. - Of course. - Here you are. - Thank you, good night. - Iwona, you're deleting it! - Jesus... Did they go to 903? That's where the noise was? I don't know. Look, the gentleman from Germany's here. Maybe I'll go and check. Go. Yeah. Where's the girl? I know nothing. Talk to the Student. And don't wake me up. - He's not picking up. - Mariusz, I've done my thing. Three times. Twice today, plus that bitch last week. Don't play games. I want double money for today. We'll talk when I get back. And don't call me at night. I am on duty at 6. You'll wake the kids. Good evening. I'm sorry, but people from below you reported some noise twice. - Yes? - Are you here alone? Someone parked in your place. I called, but you didn't answer. - I've just come back. - Yes, I've seen. I won't bother you. Good night. I'm sorry. Poznan P.D., please hold. Poznan P.D., please hold. - Kuba? - Gosia... I'm in a hotel, high up. I don't know where. Gosia, but where? Near the Brewery. Gosia? You let her fucking go. Let her go, hear me? I know where you are. I'm calling the cops... Tadeusz, hi. Put me through to the security. Directly. - He's not picking up? - No, he's probably asleep. - Right away. - All right, thanks. Hello. Security, Rafal Twardosz. Mister Rafal... Is everything all right? Yes, how can I help you? My colleague went upstairs some time ago... Yes, I'm listening. She hasn't come back and I'm worried. Good bye. - Should I log it in? - No, there's no need. Can you see the corridors? Sure, what do you think? All the building's on my shoulders. But what is it? I must log it in. No, thanks, there's no need. Fuck me! Excuse me, I'm looking for a girl. Not too tall, curly hair, slender girl. Very pretty. Shit, man! What are you doing here? - Get the fuck out of here! - My card's not working. - Is she checked in? - No, she's not. But maybe she came in here with some people? Because she said she was in a hotel near the Brewery. Are there any other hotels near the Brewery? You're not our guest? Okay, please wait a moment. Hello, Tadeusz? Sorry to disturb you, it's me again. What's going on? Iwona's still not here. Neither is the security. - Did you call Rafal? - Excuse me! I did, but he won't move his ass. - I'll go to him. - I'm calling the police. Gosia? Gosia! Jesus, Gosia, what's wrong? Can you take me to the hospital? This is Lili. Leave a message. Lili, if I don't make it, don't wait. Go alone, you understand? I'll find you. I fucking told you it would go well and it did. Kuba, hurry. Yes. Yes... Good morning, what's the... There was an accident and... - Turn it off. - I must go to the hospital. Slawek! Kuba, go. We'll explain it later. - She's got a gun! - Kuba, please, go! Gosia? What's wrong? Gosia, we're close... Police! The door! Out of the vehicle! Stand by... - Blood pressure is going down. - Hold it. Temperature, pressure? The temperature's falling. It's not her kidney. It's too big. And do you specialise in this? - No. - Then focus on your job. The patient is still conscious. No... Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can I wear this dress? Because it's going to be chilly and I have a date. I must be at the station at 9. Good, good... I must pick up Granny Teresa. Kasia and Witek will do it, no worries. Today is Saturday, yes? Yes. - I must pick up Granny. - Please, sleep and rest. Everything's fine. You are safe. - Please... - She has a really weak heart. Nonsense, she's as healthy as an ox. Excuse me... Do I have both kidneys? All the time. - All the time? - All the time. Bye, Gosia. Take care. We'll see each other? No, Kuba. We won't. What time is it? Nine. How long? How long? Five hours... Six. How long outside? Six hours. I'll call you back. It didn't work? The kidney died 6 or 8 hours ago. It was improperly taken out. But it's not hers. Are you sure it's not her kidney? The girl was cut wide open. Yes. Luckily both her kidneys are in place. - She lost a lot of blood... - May I? Well, boy. Your girlfriend had three kidneys? I'm sorry. It's evidence, please secure it. I can explain it all. Or not. I refuse to testify. Refuse? Boys, lock him up for 48 hours, he may come round. They're repainting, and in two they've put Tiny. Tiny... You'll be locked in with Tiny then. So maybe I will explain. Really, I can. If the mountain won't come to Muhammad... I don't believe it, Granny. I don't know what you messed up. But let's make a deal. You don't have to take care of me now. I'm fine. Yes, the doctor told me. Paper staples, 46 stitches? Great. Bloody good date, dear girl. Bloody. Granny, can we not tell my parents for now? They don't know yet, do they? They worry about me too much. LOVE YOU. BUT NEVER COME BACK. I TOLD MY HUSBAND. Will you forgive me? Kanada? Kurski, Mariusz? Jernas, Mariusz? Last week... ...it was not my fault. That bitch had insufficient circulatory... She had heart problems. The one today is healthy, fresh, young... I don't want my money. You must stay here for a couple of days. And once you're okay, promise you'll come to us to the country. - Promise? - Promise. Take Kuba. Come for a weekend. It's not at the end of the world. I want to meet him. No, I will come alone. And apart from that... everything's fine? Now yes. Wanted to screw me? You, Pollack. Open it! Open. I don't care who he is. He screwed me twice. He must pay for it. Next time it's your turn.
