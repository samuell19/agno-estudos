Today marks an important milestone at Invespia. Two years ago, we set out to architect a cryptocurrency exchange that would elevate the trajectory of global finances forever. Well, thanks to all of you, I am humbled to announce that we have exceeded our annual investment goals. I deeply appreciate the trust, friendship and support of every Invespia partner. Now, I know it's become a bit cliché in the tech world, but this is not hyperbole when I say that we are in the process of changing the world as we know it. [chuckles] Yeah, dude. You're the fucking cliché. [exhales] [tense music playing] Target on the move. Local on standby. I'm sure you're wondering what a handsome Brit like me is doing all the way out here. Well, mate, this is a great place to meet women. [laughs] I tell, ya. And it's excellent, as long as you know how to drive, the GPS does all the work for you, right. Which is a good plan, as long as you're not driving out in the middle of nowhere where the GPS don't work. I guess what I'm saying is I hope you know where you're going. Hello? Where you going? Oh, yeah. It looks like it's the next left about three miles up. [driver] You're traveling light. [Paul] Yeah, just here for a business meeting. Actually, would you mind waiting for me? I'm, uh, gonna try to catch the 3:00 outta here. Oh, sure. Do you want me to grab you a coffee, as well? Milk, sugar? No, I'm not waiting. This ain't a limo. Okay. I mean, how am I supposed to get another car if there's no GPS? [driver] I don't know, mate. That sounds like something you should've pre-planned, don't you think? [Paul] Right. We lost contact. Hi, Robert. This is a beautiful day today, isn't it? It sure is. Good morning, sir. And how are you today? Another day in paradise. So we received an interesting call. [Robert] Interesting? From your son. I wasn't going to speak with him, but he's coming for a visit. Everything okay? His flight has already landed. I can't wait to meet him. Kate to base. Do you copy? [grunts] [chuckles] [cell phone ringing] - Go for Ulysses. - [man] Come on, man. Yes, sir. Copy that. They're telegraphing a bat cave. Ready for this? Listen up, everybody. The mission is simple; get in and get out quietly. Neutralize anybody that stands in your way. Acquire the assets alive for the boss. - Am I clear? - [all] Yes, sir. [scoffs] Let's load up. [door opens] Good God. What's that? This, mate, is where you told me to take you. What's this all about? - Hey, how... - [guard] Please turn off your vehicle's engine, sir. This is private property. No unauthorized vehicles are allowed - on our premises. - Alright. They're expecting me. My name's Paul Michaels. May I please see your security access credentials? Credentials? I'm here to see my father, Robert Michaels. Sorry, Mr. Michaels, all visitors are required to have security clearance credentials. At a retirement community? I mean, that-that's ridiculous. [driver] Oh, hello. Hey, Matthews. Is this guy for real? Keep your eyes on them. Roger that. Mate, are you sure you want me to leave you here? [sighs] TBD. It's alright, Mr. Michaels is authorized. Yes, ma'am. [driver] That a friend of yours? [Paul] Not yet. Get out. The Terminator's coming back. Mr. Michaels, you're free to enter. Just you. Yeah. Mate, where I'm from, getting rescued by a beautiful woman, that's a good piece of luck. Definitely a step up from you, my friend. [driver chuckles] We got last known location. Let's move. [mutters] [speaks Spanish] Kate Taylor. I'm the director here. Nice to meet you, Miss Taylor. Miss Taylor sounds rather like a junior high teacher. Call me Kate. [chuckles] What's with the Fort Knox routine, Kate? Just a formality, Mr. Michaels. Well, if you're Kate then I'm Paul. Fair enough. I've heard a lot about you, Paul. Oh, yeah? What'd you hear? Your dad is very proud of you. Is he? Are we talking about the same guy? I'll escort him from here. [keypad beeping] So, what is this place? I mean, I thought this was a retirement community, what's up with the guards? They take their jobs here quite seriously, as well they should. Forge Mountain is an invitation-only, one-of-a-kind destination retreat for executives in need of a reset. Invitation-only retreat? Marketing lingo. Basically, we have a network of corporate partners and offer a variety of on-site programs for their executives. I thought you said my father had been living here for years. Also true. We have a very few who are long-term residents. Never would've imagined my dad living in a place like this. Wasn't much of an outdoorsman when I was a kid. Well, I'm sure you two have quite a lot to catch up on. Hm. I'm still getting nothing. That's fine. They can't have gotten far. We'll catch up and intercept them. Ah, did they warn you of the communication challenges here? No. The original architects in the '50s labeled it an energy vortex. And what's that mean exactly? An area conducive to spiritual healing. Sounds very scientific. [chuckles] The scientific explanation is that there's a large concentration of a rare iron ore that scrambles the electromagnetic waves, making satellite communication next to impossible. It's called "native dead space" in the satellite tech world. - Ah... - I was hell-bent on a career at NASA when I was a kid. I was obsessed with the place beyond the sky. - You know? - Oh. So, did you do it? Well, my mother was a music teacher and my dad sold medical devices. Not exactly astronaut pedigree. - Yeah. - But I play a mean recorder. [Kate laughs] [tires screech] - [horn honks] - What's going on? Howdy, thanks for stopping. Not like I had a lot of choice, was it? Listen, we're part of a special forces team for the DEA, and we're gonna need your help. My help? Yes. Can you give me the address of your last drop off? [chuckles] Look, mate, I can't give you the addresses... It's very urgent. See, the man that you just dropped off... well, he's transporting a very deadly, new synthetic drug. Look, mate, I don't want to get involved, honestly. I'm late for where I'm going. Hey, can we move this shit out of the road? I wanna go! - Are you guys serious? - Do I not look serious? Yeah, look, you do, but... Look, mate, you gotta talk to the company if you want that sort of information. I could lose my job over... [choking] You're gonna lose a lot more than your job, friend. Look... there wasn't an address. The guy had directions on a piece of paper. That's it! I can't remember anything else. Think. [choking] Fuck. Okay. Okay, alright. It's about ten miles down on County Line 12. There's a dirt road on the left, there's no sign, it's just a dirt road. There's a gate... opens to the gate. There's guards at the gate at the end. - Are they armed? - Yeah. Yeah. [panting] Thank you for your help. Hey, you expect a strongly-worded email to the DEA! I know my rights! Hey, you tell your partner to... [man] Nothing personal. - Hey... Wait, wait... - [gunshot] Please, don't take this wrong, but I'm curious to know how you found your father was here. Our residents have a saying that anonymity is Forge Mountain's most attractive amenity. Sorry to pry. Don't be sorry. I'm sure it's not a secret, we haven't spoken in a long time. An attorney that manages my mother's family estate put me in touch. I'm sure he's excited to see you. [Paul chuckles] - Really? - Yes. You're not a great liar, Kate. Alright, in all honesty, he was completely shocked. But I'm sure he's happy to see you. Ah, here we have all the amenities: pool, target range, river with loads of fish. And in the summer months there are so many grandkids and nieces and nephews, it becomes a perfect playground. You're very passionate about the place. I am. [sighs] We have our dining hall, Michelin starred chef. And loads of outdoor activities: yoga and tai chi and the book reading club. Well, everyone seems very happy. You must be doing something right. - [groans] - And loads of bugs. [chuckles] [tense music playing] Strange, boss, I've got no overhead of that entire forest. It's like some black hole. Got eyes on the dirt road the driver says ends at the gate. Weird. I got no map of that. Now look at the clearing in the trees. [woman] Perimeter fencing. That's a lot of land. What is that place? Got a few ideas. Only one way to find out. Move out. It appears the target has moved into some sort of compound. [indistinct] Zero visibility and likely no outside communication. Over. [man on radio] Infiltrate and secure the targets. Use any means necessary. Targets must be taken alive. I'm on my way. Copy that, sir. [Kate] These are the long-term resident cottages. A bit more roomy and much more secluded. And here we are. [door opens] Good to see you, Paul. [door closes] Hey, Dad. Oh... okay, then. I'll let you two catch up. [Robert] Thanks, Kate. Come inside. Relax. Come on. [tense music playing] [Robert] Take a seat. You look well, Dad. I stay busy. Well, that's good, you'll live longer. - [chuckles] - Yeah, that's what they say. So I saw the Prairie View house sold. Yeah. I loved that house. We had some good times there. Did, uh... did Uncle Bill or Aunt Katie get in touch with you? Not since your, uh, your mom died. Dad, you vanished. I tried to contact you for years. It was a difficult time. Yeah, well, that's no reason to shut everyone out and disappear. Look, I know emotions ran high after the funeral, but that was three years ago. We need to try to put things back together. I think we should have a... a serious talk. Yeah, there is, uh, something I'd like to talk to you about. But I'm-I'm gonna hit the bathroom first, if you don't mind. [tense music playing] Got a security cam, over. What are we walking into here, boss? Doesn't matter, the job is clear. [tense music playing] [sighs] [exhales] [water running] [door closes] You can do this, Paul. You deserve this. Okay. You heard of cryptocurrency, Dad? Digital assets. You've heard of Bitcoin, right? Yeah, sure. Well, I wanna show you how our marketplace streams transactions in real time. Just like a stock exchange. Real time, huh? Okay. Glad you're excited. - What? - There's no WIFI here. [chuckles] This is my company. Invespia. Ah. How'd you get online? My entire existence resides in the ether. I can get online from the bottom of the ocean. You know, I lived and breathed this company for the past five years. We're gonna revolutionize the world's relationship to money. We have a ten-year road map that will not only solidify Invespia as an industry leader in cryptocurrency, but as a major player in the global financial marketplace. I'm really happy for you, son. What do you got there, kitty cat? Magnetic plastic putty. Scrambles the camera signal, doesn't send a hardware failure alert. [Ulysses on radio] On my signal, Alpha. Don't miss. Miss Garner, I've got a camera down. [Garner] Yeah, looks like another wiring short. Damn ambrosia beetles chew up the cables. Just take it offline for now. Okay. You know what, send a north boundary patrol down to check it out. Roger that, ma'am. Alpha team, go. Jones, do you copy? Jones, come in for base camp. Do you copy? [exhales] We've, uh... We've hit a bump in the road. A key investor's pulled out at the worst possible time... pushing the exchange to the verge of destabilization. Sounds rough. What are your options? We need a quick injection of cash. A stop gap, until I can finalize a pending strategic merger. How much? Five million. Five million? Does it look like I have five million? What's this? Closing documents for a short-term loan. What collateral? Guess the land in my mom's family trust. Is this a joke? We've got a local. Hold your positions. Turn to channel three. - [static buzzes] - Sandra, what's, uh... - [static] - [dialogue choppy] Jones, you're breaking up. Do you copy? [static ringing] Sandrita, do you copy? He's got a sidearm. Hold. Hold. I have every right to borrow against my inheritance. It's not yours yet. That's why I'm asking for your help. You only came here for money. I shoulda known. You disappeared. I-I haven't heard from you in three years. Nobody has. Bullshit. You know nothing. Well, so far so good. What's the plan? We'll take him when he doubles back. That camera will be back up soon. Better he sees a hole in the fence than nine commandos. Copy that. Your mother never wanted that money. She turned her back on the family, not me. - Why? - It's complicated. [scoffs] Yeah, well, life's complicated, Dad. Especially if you don't run away from it and hide. Look, this is my last chance. Everything I've built is about to implode. Good people will lose their life savings. I know it's been a difficult couple of years. But for the first time in my life I need your help. You don't understand. [scoffs] No, I understand everything. You've been absent my whole life, work always came first. I had to teach myself how to be a man. Even when Mom got sick. You left me to take care of her, too. Is that why you got the old photo album out, to remember who I am? This was a huge mistake. [door closes] [Jones] Sandra, come in. It's almost time, my shift is over. We should take this guy out. Hold your position. There's a hole in that fucking fence. Do we have a problem? No problem, boss. Standing by. Listen to me. Listen to me. I've been on sites like this, the government sets these traps. If they hit the alarm, we're all fucking cooked. I say we get that motherfucker now. Fuck this shit, you're on your own. What the hell do you think you're doing, soldier? - Stand down. - It's that bullshit. [Jones] Sandra. Base. Base, we have a problem. The fence has been... [static buzzing] Fence? What's wrong with the fence, Jones? Jones, the camera's back up. Do you copy? Jones, behind you! [groans] Holy shit. Dang it. Miss Garner! - What happened? - Jones was ambushed! - They killed him? - [Garner] Who? What... Who the hell is that? [gunshot] Holy shit. Issue a code black. - Do it now! - Okay, okay. We have to lockdown immediately. If anyone on this team compromises the mission, you will be removed without hesitation. No second chances. We need to split up, sweep these cabins, and secure the targets alive. By any means necessary. Let's move out. [mutters] You heard him, move out. [Paul] What was I thinking? This was a fucking mistake, I knew I shouldn't have come here. [mutters] [door opens] You been keeping tabs on me? Of course. You're my son. So you knew about Invespia, but you let me make my pitch anyway? Yeah, it was cute. [chuckles] - Cute? - Yeah. [sighs] Have a nice life. I'll do it. I'll sign it. Thanks, Dad. But first we gotta talk. [alarm blaring] What the fuck is that? It's an emergency alert. - What kind of emergency? - Just relax. - It's a drill. - What is this place, Dad? Really? It's complicated. Complicated? Complicated. [man] Come on, come on. Push it, push it. That's it, that's it. Come on. Hey, can I offer you guys a water? - [door closes] - [man] Drive. Okay. [gunshots] Were those gunshots? - Yes. - What the fuck, Dad? Hang tight, I'll look. Is that a silencer? I'll be right back. [door closes] [panting] Where is he? Fuck you. I'm not telling you shit. [soft chuckle] [gun cocks] Where? Fuck you. - [silenced gunshot] - [groans] [people yelling in distance] - Thanks. - Paul's inside. Roger. Get to the fortress. [gunshots] - Where's my dad? - Come on, we're leaving. No, what's going on, Kate? We have to get to the fortress. Code black. Code black? What's the fortress? It's our emergency shelter. - Okay, well... - Get your bag. What's the emergency? You know, I should go help my dad, he probably doesn't even know how to use that thing. - [silenced gunshots] - [people yelling] - Was that my dad? - Come on, we're going out the back. - McNeill. - Yeah, boss? Main unit's requesting backup at residential. I'm heading over to assist. Nobody in or out. Copy that. Where's Michaels? - I'm impressed. - So am I. Hey! Why are all these people looking for my dad? [Kate] You'll have to ask him, Paul. There's a river through here. [tense music playing] [gun beeping] This is Hut One. We've got a suspicious vehicle approaching the area. Requesting permission to fire at any aggression. [man on radio] Permission granted. Fire at will. Roger that. Come on, buddy, make a move. [Kate panting] - Hey! - What? [bird squawking] I swear, I just heard something. - [gunshot] - [groans] [Kate yelps] [indistinct] It's okay. It's okay. - [grunts] - [Paul groans] The charge will neutralize in a minute. [Paul] What's... [indistinct] [Kate] It's like a taser. Hang on, I'll be right back. [Paul] Kate! [groans] [groans] [grunts] [cracking] [grunting] What is this place? [gunshot] Garner said they'd send transport. - There must've been an issue. - [man] Freeze! Hey! Just take it easy, okay. Don't fucking move! Boy, you are playing the wrong way. Dad? Down on your fucking knees! Really? You ready to watch your boy die, Michaels? I'm gonna kill these two motherfuckers right now. Listen, I wouldn't do that. [gunshot] Holy shit, sir! Excellent shot. Damn, I wish I had my GoPro rolling. [Robert] Thanks for coming in hot. [man] My pleasure, sir. - [gasps] - [chuckles] Cute couple. We... we're not. Mm-hm. We gotta get our asses moving, let's go. Come on! [clapping] You okay, Paul? Yeah, yeah, I'm good. Yeah, I can see that. Get to the fortress. You coming? Nah, I'm having fun. - My man. [chuckles] - Seriously? Come on. He knows this land better than anyone. Except maybe your girlfriend here. Hang on, folks. You ready? You better buckle your asses up, lovelies, next stop, the fortress! Whoo! Sorry. No worries. [hip hop music playing] Oh, yeah! About goddamn time we had some excitement around here. Shit! I love this track. I love it! Whoo! Whoo! Last stop, lovelies. Thanks for the lift. You coming with? Nah, I think I'm gonna go for a little spin. Try to rustle myself up some more trouble. Be careful, I don't know who these guys are, but they're well-trained. This ain't my first rodeo, ma'am. You just take care of your boyfriend here. Oh, we're not... Ah, right, sure. You're not. I heard that one. - [Kate] Help me. - [man] Whoo. Be good. After you. Kate Taylor, clearance level ten. [beeps] Thank you. Welcome to the fortress. The entire space has a reinforced steel beam framework and 18-inch concrete walls. It was originally designed to house up to 100 people for an indeterminate period of time. So this is no retirement retreat. Not exactly. Technically, I misled you. In the interest of transparency, I'm in fact not British. I'm American. Research shows that people find a British accent more trustworthy. - Also... - [chuckles] ...this was originally built as a secret military compound. Military? Well, that-that explains all the security, but why would my father... Nowadays, it's a place for operatives who've been compromised in the field. It gives them a chance to live a semi-normal life when the outside world becomes no longer safe. No longer safe? Speaking of safety, this is the infirmary. Let's get you checked out. Hey, boss, we got two more bodies over here. Everything looks good. Are you feeling okay? Yeah. We have a small arms security attachment here at the facility. And we have an emergency protocol at Fort Baker, about two hours away via chopper. So this is all closed-circuit internal communication? How do you get word to Fort Baker? We use an intranet networking system. Paul, I'd like to introduce you to our head of operations, Brigadier General Barbra T. Dobbs. Retired, of course. Nice to meet you, ma'am. Sorry about the disruption to you visit. But I've known your dad for a long time. How do you know my dad? [Sandra] Uh, General Dobbs, they're approaching the hot zone. Garner, team in position. Roger that, General. Let's end this nonsense. Weapons down, weapons down! [coughs] Hold fast, men. Final warning. Weapons down. Okay. [Garner] Wait a minute... Something's not right. Shit! Fall back, it's an ambush! - Say again. - It's an ambush! Fall back, fall back, reach cover! [groans] [gunfire] Let's move, people. [Ulysses] Nice timing, boss. Let's get this done. [Kate] Who are they? I have no clue. - It's Fredrick Balzary. - Dad. That's not possible. It's him. What does he want? Me. We've deployed an elite ex-Delta Force master sergeant to do recon at the section of the forest we believe to be the origin of the sniper fire. He will be our ace-in-the-hole to help us understand what's out there. I'll leave you guys to it. And what about the ground crew? We detected seven on thermal imaging, and we'll see what Sergeant Blain finds in the forest. Our internet messaging system is offline. They must be jamming it. We're unable to reach Fort Baker for support. They wouldn't get here in time anyway. We pulled back the main security force to the auxiliary building just to our north. How many left? Five security guards and Sergeant Blain. It's like they're sitting ducks out there. Let's not underestimate Sergeant Blain. He's here because he assassinated a dictator in broad daylight. [Garner] Well, maybe if you told us who this Balzary is, we could put a goddamn plan together. That's need to know. What I can tell you is that he's a notorious criminal that we've been tracking for years. So, what does he want with Robert? [tense music playing] No more bullshit, Dad. Tell me what's going on. [laughs] Yeah, I was CIA. For 30 years. Doing what? I watched financial markets... in Europe. At least that was my focus. Uh... are you kidding? My whole life is global finance. And that's all you did? Watch the markets? Neutralized it. So today isn't the first time you've killed people? And all this time I thought you sold MRI machines to hospitals. I'm sorry I lied. You didn't trust me. Paul, it's the job. I wanted to tell you. Did Mom know? Of course. So this place is some kind of government hideout? More of a place for old operatives. Like me. I wish you woulda just told me. Instead of disappearing. Me too. I'm gonna give you a code. I need you to remember it. Exactly. It may save your life. [tense music playing] Echo Two in position. Locked and loaded, sir. Clear to fire. [man] Copy that. Come on, baby. Alright, there you are. Come on. I said fire the fucking weapon, soldier. Another bad guy down for the count, folks. Looks like I'm ahead, four-three. And counting. Blain's taken out another sniper on the hillside. Ah, that's great news. I'm worried about the ground team. Agree, General. The facility was designed to temporarily safeguard against enemy attacks and natural disasters, but... Balzary's made contact, General. Patch him in. Mr. Balzary, I didn't peg you for an outdoorsman. It's true, the Riviera is more suited to my tastes. And why are you in possession of one of my radios? Well, I can assure you that its previous owner has no further use for it, as I stare here at his dead, rotting corpse. All I can really say is, it's gross. Enough with the pleasantries. I have a serious grievance with you and your government. It's your government, too, or did you just forget about your American birth certificate? I renounced that alliance long ago. I am now a citizen of the world. You know, I can send you to our complaints department, but I'm warning you, Frederick, there's a very long waiting list. Forgive me, friend, for lightly chuckling at your attempt at wit, General. But I'm not in the laughing mood. You've stolen a tremendous amount of money from my business. Money that did not belong to me, money that my clients are holding me personally responsible for. Alright, that's old news. Tell that to my wife, being held captive in some Siberian hell hole while you make snide jokes. Did you know, General, that each and every day, that same Russian mob sends me a new video of my wife. Yes. And if you were to see just one, just one single video... I promise you would not be laughing. Deals with the devil are tricky that way. Funny, you are quite the comedian. Speaking of the devil... can I speak with my once friend and confidant, my own personal Judas? Put Robert on. [Dobbs] Robert's not here. Alright, and the money is gone. Correction, it was gone... until I found it. Ahh, silence, I love that sound. That's right, I found it. All of it, in fact, still locked away in that little electronic treasure chest at the bottom of the cyber ocean just waiting. Just waiting to be opened. You see, that's the nice thing about money, don't you think, General? It's patient. Very patient, I love that. Now, I just need Robert to make like the little pirate he is and open it. Yeah, that's impossible. Enough chit-chat, General. You either figure it out or I'm on my way. That is not gonna happen. Oh, it is. I promise you it is. It is inevitable. I will be knocking on your door. The only question I have for you, General, as it falls upon your shoulders if you don't figure this out... how many people must die first? Dad... what was that all about? I spent six years... trying to get that bastard. I infiltrated his inner circle. That's where I was when your mother was dying. I told myself I was doing the right thing. But it was all for nothing. No, it wasn't. [Dobbs] Kate's right. When Robert made his move, it was brilliant. He wiped out Balzary's working capital. Six-hundred million gone with the click of a button. It disrupted arms deals, drug running, human trafficking, you name it. And he gave law enforcement a moment to catch their breath. It was the pinnacle of an outstanding career. If he found that money, my career would be shit. He wouldn't be here if he already had it. He found the shipwreck account, a virtual treasure chest, without a key, and he believes that Robert is the only one that can open it. It can't be a coincidence they got here at the same time as me. They must've followed me here. This is my fault. - It's not your fault, Paul. - It is. He would've gotten me. Sooner or later. Look, I hate to say it, but... they gonna probably use you as leverage. I'm not gonna let that happen. [tense music playing] [grunting] [groaning] [man] Get ready, he's coming. - [gunshots] - [yelling] [yells] [man] It's this way, over here. Grenade! [explosion] Security team neutralized. All clear. What's the list for? Just making sure we know who to look for when this is all over. Good call. Though I don't think we're gonna find too many alive out there. I have to try. [sighs] You know that path that leads along the river? If you go into the forest about 200 meters, you're gonna come up on a hidden ammo silo. Why are you telling me this? Just a hunch. Alright, they need us out there. Come on, let's go. - [monitor beeping] - [typing] Balzary's team has broken through our final stronghold. That was the last of our armed guards. Won't be long until those mercenaries are knocking on our door. But we're secure, right? [scoffs] The fortress was build 70 years ago. Explosive devices have evolved since then. We should prepare to defend ourselves. [beeping] Why's it gotta be so damn complicated? Uh, try the button far left. [Paul chuckles softly] Well, I don't know how I missed that. Been that kinda day, I guess. How you holding up? From what? From almost getting killed or finding out my entire childhood was based on a lie? We haven't spoke in a long time, you know. Even after my mom died... neither of us really put in the effort. At least now I understand it wasn't my fault. People like Robert and I, we choose this life. And before we realize the cost to our loved ones, we're in so deep that we can do nothing but continue to see it through. But I've never met a man more proud of his family than your dad. You wanna know the last time he called me? Three years ago. Tell me about my mother's funeral. [footsteps approaching] Excuse me, General Dobbs, they need you in the command center. Tell them I'll be right there. Your dad had to sever all ties with you in order to keep you safe. With all this going on, surely you can see why. But he missed you every single day. Miss Garner... they're here. [tense music playing] Okay. Let's get into position. [beeps] Three, two, one, fire in the hole! Hello. Anybody home? Don't shoot. I'm not armed. Stay sharp, men. - Where are your friends, Mr. Michaels? - The escape hatch. Escape hatch? Up there. Put the weapons down. Slowly. Gotcha. [Garner] Weapons down, soldiers! Hey, whoa! Don't do it! - [grunting] - [Garner] Let him go! [Dobbs] Sorry, Garner. [groans] [chuckles] Gotcha. Goddamnit. I hope it's worth it. Save the morality speech. Oh, so much racket. Oh... [chuckles] Robert. Hello, Robert. So good to see you. Is this your son? Looks just like you. A little bit more, uh... You know, on top, but... Now, Vlad, is this how we treat our guests? Let him go. [grunts] [groans] What happened to his face? [Kate] He tried to help you. I'm sorry about the nasty look, Robert. But, listen, don't worry, I made a deal with these gentlemen that everybody walks out of here. Garner's not walking anywhere, thanks to you. Stay the hell away from him. Hm. Hm. Hm. Hm. Hm. Hm. Stay the fuck away! Rise and shine, Paul. Been one hell of a day, huh? I mean, you must feel like a fish out of water. Not a trendy sushi joint or a soy milk latte around. Stop! Just stop! It has nothing to do with him. Oh, but it does, Robert. The moment you betrayed me, the moment you stole 600 million, you put Paul here right... smack dab in the middle. What? I keep getting knocked off. Something's wrong. [Paul] The connection's unstable, triggers a security kick. The system thinks you're a shitty hacker. And I have a feeling that's exactly what you are. [laughing] You are a chip off the old block, huh? Mm... so, how do we fix it? You don't try to use a satellite uplink in native dead space. Even with that much power linked to its own orbiting designator. You'll never get a strong enough connection. Hm. What's the solution? A wave rider. A what? This guy's full of shit. Hm... Ulysses. Please. [grunts] [Paul] Leave her alone! - [Balzary] You have ten seconds... - Please! ...to start making sense - You don't have to do that. - Nine, eight... Just cut me loose and let me use my own machine. Please. - Two... - It's right here in my bag. [Balzary] Ah... I had him. Vlad, Ulysses, please watch these two. Sophia... you're up. Let's escort this gentlemen into the other room. Show us, Paul. [grunts] You two assholes stay right where you are. [Balzary] Please, feel free to take a seat. Now... please, explain this to me. Well, like I said, it's called a wave rider. A prototype I designed. Instead of going up to connect to a satellite, it spreads out to create its own individualized signal - from a circuit of regional cell towers. - No way. Not out here. This is an offline closed storage digital wallet. This isn't a standard cash account, it's crypto. My dad created this wallet? Wow. From what I know, we just need the code from your dear old dad. And we're good to go. Well, it's not that easy. Hm... Careful now. Just tread lightly. You see this? Damascus steel. It's really... it's quite beautiful, don't you think? I do. You know if I were to, uh, slit your throat you would actually see the blood spill from your jugular before you even felt anything. Okay, oh... Can I just say something, please? Don't allow me to interrupt. You actually need a passkey to access digital assets. But exchanging crypto for standard fiat cash, it's not as easy as a wire transfer. It needs to be hosted on a cryptocurrency exchange. And the assets sold to buyers. But that takes an in-depth registration process and oversight by the exchange's central authority. [stutters] It can take months to find buyers. Let alone an exchange that is willing and able to handle this type of volume. Well, I guess it's fortunate that I just happen to be a chief investor in a cutting edge crypto exchange. Oh, really? Which one? It's called Invespia. - That's my company. - Hm. What the hell you talking about? WinCo Corporations. Bluepoint Global. Kilney Partners LLC. Any of these sound familiar? Just a couple of my money market funds that happen to dabble in crypto. That's impossible. I've met with all of those fund managers. Well, yes. These are legitimate investment funds. They just happen to be under my control. Hm. But don't worry, I know what you're thinking. I intend to continue my support of Invespia. You see, you are extremely good at what you do. Albeit I don't understand much of it. Mm... But what I do know... is everything is set up. You activate the 600 million in digital assets on the Invespia exchange. I already have buyers waiting to complete the transactions, and then you authorize the cash transfer from Invespia to an offshore account. [scoffs] So you waited... you waited to pull support from Invespia at the right time, knowing that I would have no choice but to contact my father for a loan. Paul... Pauly... Think about the future. Hm? Think about the transaction fees Invespia will instantly collect in a matter... of seconds. Your company... your company will immediately be cash positive and ready for the next evolution. I can see it now. You and I will be partners, and the best part... you will walk out of here in one piece. Now, enough wasting time. I need you to convince your father to give you the passkey. Hm. You already did. I'm gonna give you a code. I need you to remember it. Exactly. It may save your life. Did he now? Then what are we doing? What are we waiting for? [typing] [grunts] Okay. The buyer transactions have all been finalized. Hm. Now authorize the cash transfer to the offshore account and we're done. I can't. Not for 15 minutes. [tsking] Don't start a new game when you're already winning the first one, Paul. Invespia's bound to a 15-minute buyer ride over session for all asset purchases before funds can be reallocated. Bullshit. Find a workaround or I will. It's embedded in the software. Mandatory for compliance. In the meantime... Kate and my father and I... will be leaving. Uh... how's that? We're walking out of here. When we're safe and sound I'll authorize the transfer. Otherwise, the money will be locked away, again, but without a key. [Balzary laughing] I'll kill him if you don't authorize the transaction. You're gonna kill us all anyway. Not if you cooperate. - I am a man of my word. - So am I. I know your goons can track me down anytime they want if I don't follow through. I'm committed to make Invespia's success by any means necessary. This guarantees the company has a bright future. It's a win-win. Why would I throw that a way? Hm. You remind me of me, Paul. But Robert Carter Michaels, he stays with me. He pays his debit. Non-negotiable. Ulysses, please escort Paul and our young lady-friend here to the perimeter of the facility. Once there, he'll give you an authorization code. Radio it to me. And then I'll give you the go-ahead of when to let them go. You see? I am a man of my word. I'm not leaving without my father. Paul, just go. Go! I love you, Dad. I love you too, son. Now, go. Cute moment. Zip-tie their hands. [tense music playing] Slow down. [breathes deeply] Finally, we're alone at last. [exclaims] [exhales] Comfortable? Well, it doesn't match your complexion as nice as mine but... it'll do. [Robert groaning] [laughing] I'll fucking teach you. That's right. No one... robs... from me. He's gonna kill us when he gets what he wants. Get ready to make a move. Whoo! [laughs] Fuck! Shit! Fucking fingers are swelling up. You see what you did to me? What your fucking face did to me. You keep it up, I'm gonna make sure that your death is excruciating. You piece of shit. [grunts] Frederick, go put that on ice. I got this. Don't mind if I do. You want some ice? [chuckles] Robert... Why would you do this? You are the only honest person... that I knew. They left me down here, Robert. [indistinct] It's nothing personal. I can't take it down here anymore. I have to see sunshine. You're undoing everything that I sacrificed for. Even my wife's final days. For this. I'm sorry, I can't... I can't stay here. Interpol is tracking him. The minute he lands in Europe they're gonna pick him up, okay. Yes. Of course. I'm sorry. Be strong. Be strong. Okay. [grunts] Help! Oh, for fuck's sake, get up. - Help! - I said get up. - [grunts] - [groans] [tense music playing] [grunting] [yelling] [groans] Now, what were you and Robert chatting about? Just, uh, reminiscing about old times. Mm, reminiscing, huh? Well, as they say, life can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived forward. Speaking of which, the explosives are ready. Ulysses, what's the status? Does no one answer these fucking walkies but me? Ulysses, do you copy? Frederick, a word please. Go find them. No one leaves this mountain. Copy that. Why are you releasing your rottweilers? I mean, we had a deal, Kate and Paul walk. Well, I guess we both made a few independent decisions now, haven't we? - What are you talking about? - You truly underestimated my relationships in Europe, now didn't you? And you forgot one very important thing. What's that? Nobody trusts Americans. - [gasps] - [grunts] Oh, yeah. - [inhales] - [whimpers] It's kinda sexy, isn't it? In like a "holy shit, I'm dying," kinda way. Shit. Drag her body out of here. You have a towel? She really was getting under my skin. Alright, close to time. Keep an eye on the charges, keep an eye on the computer. Roger that, boss. I shoulda killed you. Yeah, shoulda, woulda, coulda, didn't. Well, if it's any comfort, you'll be joining your boy, Paul, in the afterlife. Sooner rather than later. Whole family together. Sounds like a happy ending to me. Yes? Any last words? Actually, yes. [laughs] I can't believe you're this stupid. Mm, how's that? All transactions are final. Your money's gone. For your sake, and your son's sake, I hope you're wrong. [chuckles] [Balzary groans] [Blain] Close your eyes, sir! [ringing] [tense music playing] [Blain] Sir, your gun, catch. [rapid gunfire] [grunts] Blow the explosives, let's get the fuck out of here. My man! Boy, you really cracked the shit out of him, sir. Ha! Nothing like a good old-fashioned headbutt to end the day. Thanks for coming back. Ah, shit, you kidding? I wouldn't miss this shit for the world. I haven't had this much fun since my honeymoon, sir. [Robert] I didn't know you were married. [Blain] Oh, yeah. Only lasted a week though. But goddamn, what a week. - How you doing? - Good, you know. Just give me a minute. I'm gonna go for burgers after. You like burgers? Now? See you in hell, asshole! [Robert] I need to help my son! I'll lay down some covering fire for you. [Robert] Beer's on me. Hell, yeah it is. You hear that, assholes? It's Miller time, motherfuckers! [grunts] Ulysses, tell me you still have Paul. Ulysses? - Ulysses! - [voice echoes on walkie] [laughs] Shit. [groans] [laughing] [sniffs] [groans] [laughs] They say life could be understood... backwards. But it must be lived forward. That's right. Do me a favor... try and save my wife. She suffered enough for my sins. Please, Robert. Done. Here... We just have to get supplies, then we'll get to the extraction point. I'm not leaving here without my father. Neither am I. I'm not leaving here without both of you. Get on your knees. Now, asshole. Now Simon says put your hand on your head. - Okay, good. - Just-just give it up. All-all your buddies are dead. [yells] [grunting] You two okay? Car's outside. Hey. Hey, comeback! Oh, come on, that's my ride! Great, sure, don't wait for me! [sighs] Easy to forget about the guy who's been saving everybody's ass. Literally, all day. God... No problem, uh... I'm just gonna hang tight here, wait for the cops to come. Sitting with my... uh, new friend. [sighs] Just tell them to be on the lookout for all the dead mercenaries. That I helped take out. Most of them. [laughs] [Balzary grunts] ♪
