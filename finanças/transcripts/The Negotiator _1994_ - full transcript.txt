[birds tweeting] Mr. King. Where have you been? Around. Yeah, I have and I've been... Billy McBirnie. What about him? He's yours... for a price. You know better than that. You've wanted him for 10 years. 15. I'm up on one, Mr. King. Nothing very serious. I thought we could trade. Billy McBirnie? You could close the book on him. Mr. King. [glass smashing] I was in Ireland, seeing my sister, I saw a face, a face I knew. He doesn't see me. -[man yells] -[Charlie] Who? [Irish Informer] Vinnie Tait. [Charlie] He's dead. I went to his funeral. [Irish Informer] He stiffed you, Mr. King. With a wee bit of help from Billy. I know where he lives, where he drinks. I reckon he's got the black on Billy. Knows where all the bodies are buried. [cards slamming] Cut. What you got? Guess. Nothing. Are you sure? With you Charlie? You can never be sure. Vincent Tait. [dramatic music] You know, you've got cat shit eyes. Vinnie's dead. For a dead man, he's made a hell of a lot of noise. He wants to deal. You, for him. You're a working man, Billy. You've been due for years. -Why don't you come with me? -[cup clatters] Make a voluntary statement. No. It would go for you in court. I'm not going anywhere. Not with you, not with court. You'd better get your coat. -It's getting- -You are pushing it, Charlie. [dramatic music] I know. You're a madman. So they tell me. [dramatic music] Yes sir? I want a bottle of champagne. Certainly. What price? Something with a big label. [dramatic music] [match strikes] Indifference. A new grace of a heaven without God. Read it in the paper this morning. Has a certain lustre of truth. Truth? Both the knife and the wound. How are you? Cold. It's cold enough to hang meat in there. Suppose I get used to it. Aye. I suppose you do. [police siren wailing] [tense music] [footsteps tapping] -[glass shattering] -[alarm ringing] [dogs barking] [microwave chiming] [phone bleeping] I'm eating. [phone bleeping] Did you know that at the Italian funerals, they applaud the coffin. [Phone Voice] It's important. We've had a report of a violent incident? When? [Phone Voice] An hour ago. Where? At the close of Cecil Street. It's close, I'll walk. [police radio chattering] [police officers chattering] Now it started here. Two floors. What happened to the lights? -Been disconnected. -Get them on. -We're trying. -Try harder. Only the top floor's lived in. An old skate, McBride, a moaning old bastard. Sam McBride? You know him? Still alive? Just about. Half man, half alcohol. You know the beast by its tracks. [Coyne] Christ. One of these days you're gonna run out of ways of taking the Lord's name in vain. Expensive. Nothing from here on. And no body, no weapon. And no blood. Where are those lights? [person knocking] [Coyne] McBride? You took your time, eh. -This is detective- -I know who he is. Even in the dark. Still got the scar Mr. King? Still got the scar, Sam. That was worth two years. That's enough of that. You're not a likeable man. What did you see? Their pus, junkies. Junkies don't wear £100 shoes. Shove 'em down the shitter. With a bayonet. Up their arse. And your lot. What are you wanks doing about it? Dealing it? Hey, shut your mouth, you filthy old pig. Who's your girlfriend? [yells] Ah, ah, okay, enough. That's enough. What did you hear? A row. Nasty, vicious. Getting closer. I was at my door by then. Well I went out to bolt it. Just voices? No words, names? Nothing specific? Oh, maybe. London. One M. Sounded nasty. The others? Two, maybe three. Whiskey voices. I want it all, Sam. C'mon. This place echoes. I couldn't make out much. [glass clatters] I'm hungry, and I'm tired. Well I heard them arguing. Away your fist, and I'll have your eyes. That was a London boy. And then it was off. It was cut, screamed like a sow. You seem to be cursed with total recall, Sam. Aye, or total bollocks. This was a war, Mr. King. You saw the blood. [Charlie] From the middle floors. None up here. None by the front door. Aye. But have you checked these empty rooms? They're nailed up. One of them opens. The heads use it. [tense music] Why didn't you tell me about this before? -What? -The door! Right Sam. Thank you. You can go now. See if they've taken his wallet. What do you want son? Do you want rubber gloves? We've got all night. [tense music] -[Coyne] Nothing. -All the pockets. That's enough of that, just get on with it. [water splashing] Frank. What day is it today? [Frank] Thursday. You sure? Thursday. [punters chattering] Excuse me. Piss off. Leave it, Peter. [phone bleeping] What? [Eddie] Charlie. When did you get back? Yesterday. Can we talk? I hate drugs. Any drugs. I don't even like aspirin. Did you know that they've given them heroin to bring them down? There's been four killings in as many months. The last one was tonight. Rats in a sack. Saves you the trouble, Charlie. Of capturing them. 500 pounds suit. Gucci shoes. A visitor. You check his wallet? I need a name. [Eddie] Francis. Give me three hours. You need a holiday. Why don't you take some time off? I've just bought a house in Antigua. Very nice. Those things will kill you. This city will kill you. Hello Charlie. Had a good day? [phone bleeping] Yes? [Phone Voice] Eddie Swan. Great God who hid from mortals sight dost dwell in unapproached light. Before who's throne with veiled brow thy sinless angels fearful bow. Are they fragrant? Not those. These are, but they're a wee bit more expensive. -How much? -£4.50. I'll take one of those. And I want something to go with them. Tulips are nice. I don't like tulips. What are these? They're not very fresh. Okay. I'll take a half a dozen of the yellow lilies. I think we've got a handle on that body. Eddie Swan. I just spent half the night... [Florist] That's £19.50. [glass shattering] Get these over to Mrs. Isaacs. Ask her to put them in water for me. The boss was asking about you, he said he hadn't seen you in the office for weeks. I hate offices. You know what he's like. Well, you know what he can be like. And office coppers. What should I tell him? Tell him there's going to be a crack epidemic in this sad, deceitful city, and it's not going to be stopped from a desk. Shall I smile when I tell him? Depends how ambitious you are. [person knocking] [person knocking] There's nobody here. [person knocking] Who is it? Police. -Sorry, I was just- -A comedian. Has he been in? I'm not sure. Be sure. One of the chaps. You'd remember. Wouldn't you. Frank Campari. When? Two nights ago, came in about 11, 11:30, sat over there. By himself? At first. Then? One of the girls joined him. No one else? Left with her. Janet Keogh? Yes. [Coyne] Police. Can we come in? What do you want? Not out here. Can I sit down? My feet are killing me. [door creaking] Have you seen "Who's That Knocking at My Door?" What? Dry run for "Mean Streets". "You don't make up for your sins in the church. You do it in the streets. You do it at home." I think it was a better film. I like him in, what was it, just recent. "Cape Fear"? All in tattoos. [Charlie] You like tattoos? It's that look in his eyes when he turned sideways. -Take your shoe off. -What? Your shoe. Take it off. Why? Please. -My feet are dirty. -So are mine. How long have you been using? Not long? You met a man at Le Samurai, from London, Eddie Swan. Who sent you? No one. He was up on business, wanted company. I were at the clubs. You were a courtesy? No tells. Have you ever been to prison, Janet? It's hot, noisy, smells... of despair, loss, regret. And I'm not just talking about six months for drugs and prostitution. I'm talking about 10 years, for conspiracy to murder. Murder? He was found face down in a bath of his own blood, lungs full of water, 11 stab wounds. -They didn't tell me that- -No, they didn't tell you, because they didn't know they were going to kill him. Get off. [Coyne] It's all right. I want you to tell me. I can't. [Charlie] Yes. You can. You don't know what they're like. Oh yes I do. I do. I know what they're like. Brain sick. They'll kill me. No. They won't. Because I'm going to put them away. If I tell you, I'm dead, and you know it. Now listen to me. Janet. I'm the only one who can help you now. Take her in. [sombre music] [dramatic music] [dramatic music continues] [engine throttles] [engine revs] Get me Coyne. [Phone Voice] Coyne here. Check out a white Nissan, registration J... oh forget it. No, don't know him. But I know someone who might. He owns a club. And you're sweating. It's started, hasn't it? See in two hours, you're gonna feel like raw meat. [boys chattering] Come on you lads, scram. He's dead. [Frank] Charlie. Charlie. -[tyres screeching] -[dramatic music] [car horn honking] [woman screaming] [water lapping] [Doctor] How are you? [Charlie] When can I get back to duty? [Doctor] It's not that simple. [Charlie] What do you mean? [Doctor] It's not when. [Charlie] I hope I didn't hear you. As I've already explained to you, Mr. King, you have a potentially serious heart defect. I can't understand why it hasn't been diagnosed at your previous medicals. Under certain circumstances, very stressful situations, you could have died. Have you ever felt pain? I don't eat regularly. I eat shit. I get indigestion. That's not mentioned in any of the reports. Everybody gets indigestion. Not with that degree of pain. If it was what I think it was. You're a good bit overweight. I'm going to send you to a dietician. I don't have time for diets. Today, Mr. King, your life has to change. Your lifestyle- I've been eating chips and chocolate bars for the last 30 years. That's quite obvious. I can still run half the lads in my unit. And not feel dizzy? This is getting nowhere. Just say to me what you've got to say. There's no possibility of you resuming the same sort of active duty you were involved in before. If you take care of yourself, diet, exercise, proper sleep pattern, then I'm prepared to recommend that they allow you to continue service. Your progress will be monitored, monthly to start with- You're taking me off the streets? Mr. King. If I put you back on the streets, you'd be dead within a year. If I were you, I'd take early retirement. I know, I know. I've, uh, had a look at your service file as well as your medical reports. You're a quite remarkable police officer, Mr. King. One that this city could ill afford to lose, if possible. I'm a thief taker. A shadow man. A stone in their shoe. I get inside them, inside their heads. I know what they're going to do even before they do. That city's my life. There are other lives. -Not for me. -Other duties. Polishing a chair in an office. Equally stimulating, but less active. I'm sorry. Is that it? Superintendent Eastman will be seeing you. Why the smile? Jack Eastman couldn't find his arse with both his hands. He's a paperclip counter. He wouldn't last two minutes right there. What's important to you, Mr. King? Anything that makes us consider our natures. Heard you were in. See the lump. That's enough of that. You show some respect. He hates your guts. He calls me Charlie. That job should be yours. Could be. So I'm told. With you in there, we could have this retread rat hole in its ear. That killing, Eddie Swan. What happened to the young lass? Didn't you hear? No. Look, we had to let her go. She wouldn't give us a thing. Too frightened. Terrified. They got to her. If I tell you, I'm dead. And you know it. Officially, she died of an overdose, right? But that's bollocks. I mean she never fixed her thigh before. Charlie. Charlie. [dogs barking] Hello Charlie. Hello Kath. Thanks for coming. How are you? I heard you weren't too good. Tried to get in to see you in hospital, but they said I wasn't family. I told them I wasn't family. I was your nearest... You don't look after yourself. Never did. What's the matter Charlie? You look... so sad. Come up to the house. Have a drink. I don't drink. I know. [Charlie] You've still got that whiskey bottle that plays Beethoven's 9th? [tense music] [woman screaming] [Charlie gasping] Charlie. It's okay Charlie. Just a bad dream. Charlie? You all right? Charlie? I killed a girl. Well, as good as killed her. I don't want to lose your Charlie, Christ, I need you. Then put me back to work. -I can't do that. -Why not? Excuse me. You know I can't. You know me better than anyone. Aye. I should do. You've given me more grief than any other officer. And more results. [police chattering] Let me, uh, look around for something else for you. What? Charlie, don't be bloody stupid. I don't know, I've just said. I'm not going inside. Not even to run a squad? Not even for your job. I always had your down for an ambitious man. Well, I'm not ready to go upstairs, not yet. For Christ's sake, you're 54, you've been in the job since God was a boy. I've still got a dance or two left in me. Look, just, you've got some leave left, okay. -Take a week off- -I'm bored shitless. In one week, we'll have something to... -Yes? -Excuse me, sir. The meeting's starting, sir. -Two minutes. -Yes sir. Sorry about this. [Charlie sniggers] What's that for? Well could you imagine me in there? Yes. You can be the most charming man I've ever known when it suits you. They think they're doing good, those people in there. They mistake caring for conscience. They don't realise the damage they do. You know the trouble with you, Charlie. You read too much, you think too much, and you don't listen. You're like a Jehovah's witness. They don't listen. They're not listening. They're just praying for you to stop talking so they can start. The fish is always fresh. Not one syllable. The carrots are very good. Unlike the company. Very, very prepossessing, Charlie. So... what are you going to do? About what. When you leave? Well I haven't left yet. You will. Well then you know more than I do. I know you're wasted there. Have been for years. They don't deserve you, Charlie. Come in with me. I don't like business. You know about people Charlie, more than any man I've met. Business is people. Businesses is war. [patrons chattering] What's the alternative? You could eat around the crust of security, I suppose. Work for some lousy bank, insurance company. Like the rest of them. What a waste. I could make you a rich man, Charlie. 10 years ago, and six pounds in my pocket and a pair of shoes, two sizes too big, because they couldn't find mine, just out of the Stone Hotel. Nothing. You'll hear me out. Charlie. Take those things off. You buried me, Charlie. I was due, I know. But then you resurrected me. You are a perverse bastard. -Look- -No. You look. You are the only real friend I've got, the only man I trust, the only truly incorruptible man I have ever known. I am not going to allow you to piss the rest of your life away. Life's just a way of getting by. I learned that early on. You struggle to remember and then you struggle to forget. I don't want money. I'm not interested in money. You lose something fundamental. You lose who you are as a person. Money is its own quarrel. Nearly all relationships are exploitative. Marriage, friendship. Mutually exploitative. Ours is full of contradictions. In many ways, we're the same. Obsessive, ambitious, single minded, we were never educated, but we've never doubted ourselves. We can laugh at a well-told lie. We both know the danger of words. [tense music] But in one way, and perhaps the most important way, we're opposites. You don't like people. Man devours man. That's your credo. I have a simple, ultimate belief in the human spirit. I believe in God. You don't. [sombre music] What can a friend say? That slime they found in the bath. His brothers are up. They're useful. Where? Around. Tooled up, would you believe? Drop me here. I need some fresh air. I'm all right, Charlie. -Can I? -Yeah. A friend of mine's, Fiola Keogh. Kiting. Comes up next week. I'll see what I can do. [police siren wails] You remember Stuart Shaw? [Charlie] By reputation. I don't really know him. I want you to go and talk to him. -Why? -Just talk to him. About what. He'll explain. Why so cryptic? Friday. London. Oh, I don't wanna go down- Flights arranged, car will collect you at Heathrow. What is this? This is strictly between you and me, Charlie. You understand? I need a favour. One week, seven days. What are you up to? Some unfinished business. Young lass, bad teeth, better nails. What are you talking about? [Charlie] Just another body bag. Charlie. Someone stuck a needle in her. If you're saying what I think you're saying- I'm going to bump heads with those bastards. Charlie. One week on the streets. Or I'll put my papers in. You mean that? Do I say things I don't mean? [football crowd chanting] [TV Commentator] Well this could turn out to be one of those great European nights for Aberdeen. Savoured many of these in the past. -Yeah? -[Coyne] Pizza. How much? Uh, 50. Pence? Pounds. You trying to be funny? American hot. Next to pepperoni. It's getting cold. Where's your brother? Are you listening? You filth? No. We are police officers, Mr. Swan. Smells good. I could eat a baby's bum through a cane chair. I asked you a question. He's out. Getting fags. Are you armed, Mr. Swan? Place it on the table. Now. I don't like people who come to my city with guns. They butchered Eddie, ripped his guts out. Animals. Yeah. But they're my animals. I forgot my poxy wedge, didn't I? It's all right. How you doing? Taking over? It's the police. Are you sure? On the table. I've got six officers downstairs. It's all right. It's all right, he's got mine. What, this? Hey? You want this? Well come and take it, old man. Charlie. Come on, Charlie. I suggest you behave yourself. You've got some front, Charlie. Just testing. -[lounge music plays] -[patrons conversing] That's taken. So's that one. What do you know? I hate it. He started taking that stuff. What was it, about a year ago, wasn't it? Yeah. And then he started dealing. Was making a lot of money. Before he got a living by just ducking and diving, but compared to this, it was just tips. He changed. There's a lot of stuff was buckling his brain. Yeah. Give me the right pain often. Well, I try to tell him to tell him, Paul tried to tell him, but he wouldn't listen, he was too busy with himself. He said, he said it doesn't matter. I said it does matter, it does. What's the difference, I mean they're all at it. The phases. What's the point of risking 15 years for grafting on the pavement when he gets 20 grand a week for some poor soul's misery. Who was he dealing with up here? You tell me. Did you get anyone? Not really, no. It's just Johnny Walker wisdom, nothing else. We've got to be careful, you know. You've got some very violent people up here. I want you out of here within an hour. Go home, don't come back. Ever. [tense music] [police siren wailing] I don't know if it's anything, but it's all I've got. I've never known it so tight. No one's talking. The crack's coming up from London into a front. I don't know where. I don't even know if it's in the city yet. But the man whose minding it has been paying off his debts. He was into a lender for a lot. Which one? I don't know. But I know it was about 20 grand, six, seven months ago. Well there can't be too many to afford that. The widow? -Hit me. -What? Hit me. Somebody's watching. [clock chiming] [dog growling] Times have changed, Charlie. It's not a few pounds anymore. I mean, what's a thousand pounds today? Can he be trusted? Sometimes. The list of the lost? Three thousand. Eight. Eleven. Paid it off seven months ago. Twenty two thousand? Sudden money? The collateral was a shop. Door's round here. [door bell ringing] Yeah? Police. [footsteps hurrying] Get it open. [toilet flushing] You will be charged with conspiracy to supply controlled drugs. Do you understand? The implications? Look, Mr. Hussein, I know that you only hold that stuff. Who delivers it? Who collects it? Do you know about the girl? They killed the girl. She told us nothing. But they killed her. [airport information system broadcasting] [Traveler] Hello mother. Flee, flee, the sad hotel. Shite hole. Thank you. High winds. Bit bumpy. Did it delay your flight? 10, 20 minutes. Some tea, coffee? That'd be nice. Which? What are you having? -Coffee. -Tea. [police siren blares] [Shaw] Could we have a tea, Ms. Keane? [Ms. Keane] Yes sir. Thank you. You don't like London? I prefer Paris. When I get there. You speak French? I try. Taught yourself? German. Mengele used to whistle Mozart. A little Russian. [women chattering] I brought a bag, but I don't really want to stay over night. That might be necessary. Look, Mr. Shaw, why am I here? I like straight talking. You may have to absolve yourself of that bad habit. [tense music] [Police Radio Voice] Car stopped outside. Hello. She's getting out. Well what's she doing? Looking at the shop. I've lost her. She's looking in the window. She's looking... into the shop. She's taking a bloody good look. She's looking at the door to the flat. Wh- what's she doing now? Just looking. Do you want me to take her? No, wait. [doorbell ringing] Stand by. I was looking for Mr. Hussein. Get off me! What are you doing? -Leave me- -Who are you? I came to see Mr. Hussein. Yeah, what about? His daughter. She's in care, I'm her social worker. Satisfied? Police. Where's your identification? Look, this place is under surveillance. We thought you were- I've had two complaints about police methods upheld already. You think you're above the law. -You're not. -Look, I'm sorry. Can I go now? There are certain circumstances- Can I go? [Allan] What's happening? Andy? I've just been gutted. I know almost everything about you. Joined the job in '64, you were 22. Three years on the beat in the east end of London, worked your way through CID. CIB. Fraud. Became head of the Yard's Interpol unit. Then SO11, then ATB. Then... what? I know you're still a serving officer. Computers are useful things, but they only tell you what you're permitted to know. For the last three years you haven't existed. Now that has to be political. Politics don't interest me. It's got too much to do with power. I'm told you have a way with people, an instinct that is sometimes quite extraordinary. There was that rapist. His wife was a serving police officer. Very delicate for us. I don't think anyone could have handled it better. You're not a trained hostage negotiator. No. Yet you talk that man out of that hotel siege. He talked himself out. No, Mr. King, he did not. He was tired, hungry, and very, very frightened. He wanted to make sense of everything. I asked him why. Why? Why do we need to make sense of everything? There's no reason, purpose or significance to most things we do. In a strange way, he understood. You don't? Not entirely. A lack of sense. The lack of reason. When it was pointed out to him in his particular predicament made sense. I also told him we'd shoot him. I want you to meet someone, his name's Avaddy. Talk to him. [dog barking] Have you heard of Cesare Lombroso? No. Has a bizarre theory about women terrorists. Insists they have more body hair than normal women. [Thug] Move, and you bleed. Shoot the women first? They're more dangerous? You don't believe that? I don't like generalisations. Andy. [Coyne] Yeah? Could you come over here please? [Coyne] What for? There's something I've got to show you. Give it a try, Charlie. Does no harm to listen. Listen and learn. I've been looking forward to meeting you. Allan. -Drink? -I don't. I know. Then why ask? I'm younger than you thought. Everyone's younger than I think. Does it disturb you? In what way? If you had to take orders from a younger man? It depends. On what? How much he drinks. -[Coyne] Allan. -[Allan] Up here, Andy. God, what's so important I have to come all the way up- [Allan] Andy! The role of security in this country and many countries is going through a radical rethink. With the end of the Cold War, the threat from international communism was almost overnight diminished to a degree where it's no longer an imperative. So we shift our focus onto other agendas. Drugs, fraud, industrial espionage, organised crime. The IRA. Yesterday, the enemy was grubby products of polytechnics. Disorganised groups of extremists with their doom-laden romantic defence of the gun and the bomb. [Charlie speaks German] [Avaddy responds in German] Today things are changing, not just national, but world events. It's a different landscape. The warriors are turning into thinkers, strategists, manipulators. They're infiltrating mainstream politics, economics, international business, leisure. This new paganism, the fatal attraction of the fast buck. And of course the new Christianity of the green world. There's a whole new level of sedition. I mean, when does fraud become political? The problem is who's going to deal with it? You? Us? It's starting to overlap in so many areas, it's becoming blurred. The last thing this country needs is a secret police force. We're hardly trusted as it is. So, it's got to be sorted out. [lock clattering] [tense music] Wait here. [tense music continues] We've formed a new experimental liaison group, police and security. It'll have the highest priority. Similar groups in other countries are also being established. There will of course be very necessary interaction. I know you like to travel, Charlie. When I do, I like to know where I'm going. We need negotiators. Men who can smell a lie, who have a natural instinct for mendacity, who know people, their weaknesses, their strengths, sense their secrets, someone who can smile and piss down the legs of the power brokers and politicians. Think about it. Well, not too long. You've nowhere else to go, Charlie. You'll find that out. [tense music] You're a church man. You believe in God. I also believe in the devil. The vengeful god. The forced Christ. My Christianity is not forgiving. I'm not reluctant to punish. You remember my colleague, Detective Sergeant Andrew Coyne. I've just visited him in hospital. He isn't expected to live. We get very vexed with people who kill police officers. I want my lawyer. You're on remand. I want my lawyer here. If you're going to accuse me- You'll be safe... here. No, I'm going to say nothing to you. Out there, you will have no friends. Out there, you won't last a day. He's already killed twice. Swan, the girl, Sergeant Coyne will be the third. He's getting a taste for it. Your remand order will be rescinded. You'll be expected to sign some papers. You can't do that. It's done. I won't go. Goodbye, Mr. Hussein. Good luck. I won't go. He'll kill me. He has to. You're the only one who can identify him. Please Mr. King. Mr. King. Mr. King! Mr. King! All right, I will write his name down. I won't say it. I can't say it. [pop music plays] That's taken. Do you not hear me? You got shite in your... You want a wish list? First wish. You wish you weren't here. Second wish, you wish I wasn't here. Third wish, and you only get three. [man chokes] Last wish. You wish that God in his infinite mercy will let for another 30 seconds. Don't, Charlie. He's not worth it. -[church congregation singing] -* Praise to the Lord * * Who doth prosper thy work and defend thee * * Surely his goodness and mercy shall daily attend thee * * Ponder anew what the Almighty can do * * If to that end he befriend thee * * Praise to the Lord * * O let all that is in me adore him * * All that hath life and breath * * Come now with praises before him * * Let the Amen sound from his people again * -Frank. -Charlie. * Gladly for ay we adore him * [Eddie] I was sorry to hear about your boy, Charlie. He'll need a job. He won't be able to do much. I'll work something out. Thank you. So, I hear you're moving on. Maybe, maybe not. Charlie. Be careful. They are the big boys. I judge a man by his conscience. They don't have them. They can be taught. I've got something for you. [tense music]
