- Semret, do you speak Italian? - Yes. Great. I need your help. Come. Now, no more pushing. Don't push. No! Cut done. Push. - Now? - Now! Push. With all your strength. The head's born. You see. Well done. The umbilical cord's stuck. - Push again. - One more time. Daniel, help. I'll take over. You're so strong. So much stronger. Joe... can you come? I'm coming That looks nice. This course is important, you have to work hard, pay attention. Yes I know. I want to go to high school. I'll make an effort, I promise. Room 305. 3rd floor. Mum, alone. About the school... Compulsory education? The certificate? You completed compulsory education, a kind of high school, in... 2003. The last year at the Sawa military camp. Yes, like everyone. How old were you then? 17. Then you were directly drafted? That's the highest school degree in Eritrea, theoretically allowing you to go to university. But the government largely closed them after student riots. Alright, Mrs Dawit, It's really a condition for becoming a midwife. But we'll reconsider your application. Last week Eva, now Xenia... luckily Jonas is a bit calmer. And yours? How old is she? Has she had a boyfriend yet? Some start early, others a bit later... Joe, isn't it? - You're not from around here? - I take the tram. May I? Wow, awesome! Is that you? And this your dad? Is he here too? I never see my dad either. Bullshit! Who says you can eat ice cream only in summer! Is that Eritrean? The owners are the grandparents of a girl at my school. - Have you been here before? - No. What are you doing? Billard table, pictures and baskets... Is this your alphabet? What does it say? Can I eat at Hannah's? - I don't want that. - Please, Mum. - It's almost dark. - I'll be home at 8 pm. I don't know Hannah or her mother. - OK, I'll come home. - I'd prefer that. Shall I cook dinner? I'll be late. See you tomorrow. I'm Yemane. I have to change the tube. I have to... Hannah's mum knows some families who're looking for babysitters. And school? Sure, but now and then. What does Hannah's mother do? Mum, why are you asking again? I don't know. She's at home a lot, doing projects. Projects? I don't know... Art or something. I know what we can do this weekend. And her father? She doesn't have one either... Look, I found this at a restaurant near school. I really want to go there. It's just a concert. - You know. - No, I don't know. You're Swiss. I'm not! But almost... Mum, look at me! It makes no sense! Then I'll go alone. I forbid it! Joe? Dinner's ready. I've made lasagne. My dear. How long has it been? You're so grown up already! - Are you visiting Zurich? - I work a lot. Did you like the concert? Very much. And it smells so good here. Coffee and popcorn: the smell of our earth See you later. Mum, I'd like to stay. - They're nice. Let's talk to them. - What are you doing? Hey, hello! Do you come here often? I've never seen you here before. I'm Yemane. I work at the hospital. Nice to meet you. It's my first time here. It's great. This is my nephew, Tesheme. - Hello. - Joe, hi. Why don't you get something to eat? Everything alright? Shall we join them? - What's this? - That's shiro. Try it. Why are you laughing, you cheeky little girl? We always eat this very hot! - How long have you been here? - I was born here. And where are your parents? My mum's here somewhere and my dad drowned while fleeing, before I was born. - You believe that? - Why? Don't listen to this dwarf here... Buzz off! Go find your mother. She must be waiting for you. Look at all the food. Try some, you'll love it. Shall we eat together? It's really beautiful here! They were all really nice to us. I'll definitely go there again! Can I meet Hannah at school? I'll be home at 5 pm. Are you coming to the basement too? - Maybe later. Go ahead. - OK. See you. - Let's go too. - I have to go home. Please! Ben will be there too! And what should I tell my mum? Text her that we're studying at my place. You reached Joe, I can't pick up right now. Hannah told me that you're very close. She's never lied to me before. OK. It's nice that you trust each other so much. But didn't you cheat sometimes when you were a teen? Like a glass too? It's Sunday. They'll be at the Youth Club and there's no reception in the basement. That's normal. Hello! Hey my girl. Did you have a good time? See. Here they are. - Do you have a visitor? - Hi Mum. They've all decided to give birth at the same time. Julie Probst. She's single, a first-time mother. Was admitted 1 hour ago, first-stage labour, so far all good. It'll be a while for her... By then one of the midwives will be free. You'll have to look after her until then. Alone? - But I've never... - There's always a first time. Hello. I'm Semret. Can you stop that thing! Sorry, I'm just a trainee. I don't care. I'll push the button if there's a problem. Turn off that machine, it drives me nuts. When were you last... Call me by my first name, we're going to have a baby together. When were you examined? I'm glad that I'm not alone. I... I understand. And the father? It's just mine. Do you have kids? Come. Doris, have you seen my cell phone? Ah, it's yours? It vibrated a few times in there. Everything OK? Have you changed Noemi today? Several times. Her mother always had visitors. Exactly, that's her! And the meconium? My writing pad... It's upstairs in my uniform. OK. Because the last few hours are missing in the report. Sorry, I had no time. But she passed it. Wait. That means they can go home. And with Julie, all good? Was it a nice birth? Heller sent me... She was with her students and... - It got too crowded. - Always the same. - Heller and her students! - But... That's not fair. Yeah, it isn't, but you can't do anything. Always stay friendly or you get into trouble! Can you take this to the secretariate? Have you finished? Hannah? - What about knocking? - Hello! Great that you're here! Hannah's such a fan of yours! Mum, are you high? See, I did that. When she still allowed me! Don't you draw as well? You have to show me some time. Yeah, OK. Man! She's a pain! And your father? She says he's the best DJ ever! What do I get out of that? A disco ball! This disco ball's great! Yeah, sure... I haven't seen him for 5 years. How often do you see your dad? Do you trust your mother? Do you know much about him? Not really. She doesn't like him very much. Otherwise they might still be together. But she never speaks badly about him. Mine never talks about him. She says it makes her sad. Everything makes her sad. She dreams and cries at night. Can you hear her? Yes. Sometimes she sleeps in my room. In your bed? We have a small flat... OK, but it's a bit unusual. Where have you been so long? It's not even dark yet! I was at Hannah's. Wouldn't you like something new? - How old were you when... - Let's make an appointment. - How did you and Dad..? - Or cut it? I mean it! Sorry! How did Dad and you meet? I went to the countryside with my mother. Visiting some relatives. The adults were eating and chatting... I was about your age. We went outside to play. Me and my cousin, we liked to sing. The boys played soccer. We just wanted to sing. Her voice was so beautiful, but she was shy. I don't want to talk about it. HI TESHEME, WHAT ARE YOU DOING TOMORROW? And what about that happy button? You're doing very well. We wanted to do it all natural. You're not doing anything here. Let's see how dilated the cervix is, then we know more. Sterile gloves? You have no idea. It tears me apart each time. You told me if we get here, I should try to stop you. I know, but it's much worse than last time. I imagined it to be different. You're doing great. Semret. Well. The cervix is only dilated 4 cm. You can get dressed again. It'll take a while. What does "a while" mean? If the contractions remain regular, it'll be at least another 3 hours. After high school I want to study art. - And you, what do you want to be? - Doesn't matter. Come on, tell me. Oh... Exactly, doesn't matter. An apprenticeship would be cool, earning some money... I can help you with the application. I'm great at that. Maybe my family could join me then. Look! My family, my siblings, my best friend, my parents, I used to live here. Do you have pictures? Me? I've never been there. Don't your relatives send you any? On Facebook or Instagram? My mum has no one left there. What did the boy mean? Who? At the concert. You know, when he asked the little girl: "Do you believe that?" Why shouldn't she believe that her father drowned? Why do you want to know that? My father drowned too, while fleeing, before I was born. That's what she tells me. Semret. You've come? Where's Joe? You're frozen. Come in, I'll make you a coffee. Where are they? Just out for a bit. I'll wait downstairs. Your German's already pretty good. Mine's pretty bad. Even the letters... But school was never my thing. But you got work. Only 50%, integration programme. At least. And before? Sometimes construction, moving, cleaning... More money. Illegal? If there's a problem, you're gone. What are you doing in hospital? I need your help. How? Joe's still young. My daughter, your nephew. She's 14. Yes, OK. Here the teenagers are different, I don't want this. I'll talk to him. He 's a good boy, he'll understand and respect it. It's dark. Why are you so late? Relax... You found me. - Have a nice evening. - See you tomorrow. Mrs Gallo and Orlando are new in 302. At 1.32 am, spontaneous third para, intact vagina, uterus minus 3. No trouble breastfeeding. You won't get bored today. One birth in progress, semi-private, they'll be in 304. It'll have to be changed into a family room. And 2 have just come in. There's nothing going on between them. They talked, looked at photographs. Joe's helping him with his applications. OK... Don't you trust me? - What is it? - It's... I don't want her to know certain things. Did you desert? She knows that. But many things she doesn't. I'll help you. We could do something all together? But I don't want them to see each other again. That'll be difficult. They're no longer children. Maybe you're right. Semret, we need you. What's going on with you? You're late, absent-minded. And now you take a coffee break before the day's even started! Have you heard from Midwifery School? So pull yourself together. If the management finds out, there could be trouble. That's just what he says now. He's a good student. You optimist! You'll soon find an internship. I can't work without a permit. - Don't you have one yet? - We have one. It's just being checked again. It'll work out. It worked for you. Desertion was reason enough. Now they say it's OK to go back. - What do they know? - I told you. And I was alone and Joe... was still a baby. Fuck politics. Shall we play billiards? I'm sorry. I'm afraid I can't help you. I thought you might know something or someone... Just look at them... Their whole lives lie ahead of them. And we... We left everything behind for them to be better off. Was it a mistake? I'm better than you! What's going on? What are we doing here? Come on, "adjocha"! That's what you always say. That we wouldn't have survived otherwise. What was it? What happened? There was this moment on the boat. At first the sea was calm, then a heavy storm raged with high waves. We felt sick, everyone vomited. "Adjocha", I said to Tesheme, it's in God's hands. He has a plan. Among the people on the boat there were different religions and languages and we all started to pray together. Thy Kingdom come. Thy Will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. In this moment of fear and despair we were one. We thought the waves would never stop, but after 3 hours it was over. And then everyone was alone again. Keep singing, Mum. - Good morning. - Good morning. She was taken to the children's hospital with a circulatory collapse. You signed the discharge. If no meconium, then ultrasound. Didn't I say that? - Yes, true. - And did you see it? I need to see the whole report. Thank you. She has a lot on her mind. Semret... Shit. She's usually so precise. How could that happen? Noemi's in the NICU. We don't know if she'll make it. She told me... And we let her go home. There'll be an enquiry. Semret... What is it? A circulatory collapse. They say it's my fault. I don't understand why. You can't say anything... They're always right. It'll be alright. You don't know that. That's true, I don't know. But after all you've been through, you'll weather this. You need to have faith. Thank you. Show me. Dr. Color Egger... Color... car repair shop. Then you need to write why you want to work there. You start with: "Dear Sir or Madam"... Come on, let's dance. Like this? I have something for you. Like that, right? I don't want to tell Joe what happened at work. She shouldn't worry. Please don't tell Tesheme. OK, no problem. Hello. Hi Mum. Are you alright? Ready for the exam? I think so. With Tesheme? Do you get along well? Not bad. And Yemane? - Do you like him? - Great! - Are you seeing each other? - Maybe... We'll invite them for dinner... - No, better just the two of you! - Maybe... Not maybe, definitely! You have to marry him, then they can stay here... and I'd get the coolest big brother! I'm not marrying anyone. Meheret? We thought the worst was behind us, but then we had to pay again. And we had no more money. We had to clean all day... The cleaning company was a cover... At night they came and lay on us. I stopped counting. But the stench of their bodies... I'll never forget that. I'm not a victim, I'm a survivor. It's not my fault. I know that I'm safe now. But I can't sleep. As soon as I close my eyes I see everything. 50 people in an open Toyota van. Less and less water. And if someone fell off the van they just kept driving. At night the smugglers... We tried to protect ourselves. Hide our faces. Sometimes I think that I'm rotting from the inside. - It's not my fault. - It's not my fault. -Stauffer. - Hello Doris, how's the little one? Hello Semret. Better. Her condition's stable. Thank God. And how are you? Not bad. The enquiry starts on Monday. But don't worry about me. It'll be fine. - Somehow, there must... - They're taking good care of her. There must be another answer, I'm sure. You're probably right. The doctors there are great, they'll find the answer. - You can't do anything. - Of course, I understand. But thank you. Crazy, Mum. - Do I even hear music? - Meheret gave me her playlist. She's such a cool woman. What did you eat? Pizza, but that doesn't matter. - Is he already there? - Have a nice movie. See you tomorrow. - Welcome. Come in. - Thank you. - Your coat? - Thank you. You have a beautiful apartment. - How did you manage to... - Please, take a seat. - For you. - Thank you. This is unexpected. - Can I help you? - No, you're my guest. I'll just clean up some things. I don't want this. - What is it? - It doesn't work. It was a mistake. You and your nephew, you're destroying our lives. What kind of life is that? You hide from everything. Semret, you need help. Talk to me. Go away! It is not my fault? It wasn't my fault. There has to be another reason. - The baby... - Look! The meconium! I wrote it down precisely, 13:24. Semret, the enquiry will... With meconium ileus there are other symptoms: a swollen belly, vomiting. - Noemi didn't have either. - True. There must be another reason. An acute pancreatitis, for example. - It's very rare, but in newborns... - Pancreatitis? It might lead to a circulatory collapse. Look here. Hi Mum. Hello. I don't want you to see each other. Stay away from her! What the fuck's going on? You and me, that's all that counts. - What happened? - We don't need anybody. You're hurting me. We can't let anyone into our lives. Are you crazy? I always knew it. What are you talking about? Everything alright, carry on as before, don't let anyone in. You're sick! What crap are you talking? Finally I got friends. You're just jealous. Because you have nobody. - Let go of me! - You're destroying my life! What are you doing? My exams are on Monday. I need rest. I can't take care of your shit right now. Where are you going? To Hannah's. Don't leave me alone. Mum, I can't help you. - It's not my fault. - What are you talking about? There's an enquiry, but it wasn't my fault. Can't you just tell the truth for once? I know everything anyway! - Mum, let me pass! - No... Mum, let me go! What do you know? That my father didn't drown. But I don't care! You know everything? You have no clue. - In the military, fleeing... - Mum, calm down! I had no chance. Again and again. It was hell. I hadn't had a period for a while. Then I realised. First I was shocked. I didn't know what to do. I hit my belly, I wanted to get rid of it, but it stayed. You stayed. After such a... such a long time of solitude... After... hell... I was finally not alone anymore. Who your father is... I can't tell you... I tried to drown him in the Mediterranean. You should have got rid of me! Come in. I want to apologise. I overreacted. I was wrong, I can't go on like this with Joe. Me, me, me. You're not alone in this world! Others have shitty lives too. Asylum decision? - We'll appeal. - Too late. I'll help you. You hide and then we try again. The laws are changing. I'm not a criminal. I won't be locked up anymore.
