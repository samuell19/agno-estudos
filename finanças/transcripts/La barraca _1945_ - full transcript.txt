This is the story of heavily barren fields found in 1880, in an orchard in Valencia. These ruins suggest strange, distressing things that disturb the mood and depress the heart. Yes, the story of these fields and this cabin, that looks like a dirt smudge, on the velvet mantel of beautiful Vega, is a story woven with tears and blood. Ten years ago, Uncle Barret was its tenant as his parents and grandparents had been, since 100 years ago. Honest and hardworking like them, but more unfortunate. Uncle Barret was unlucky. His wife gave him four daughters and no sons. The eldest was named Rosario. The girls, like their mother, were very good and hardworking but they couldn't help their father. Since the land was too much for one man, even though the poor old man worked day and night, it wasn't enough and he was always tired and in debt. But Barret's worst fate was his land falling in the hands of a loan shark, exploiter of the poor farmers, always asking for more. Everyone in the fields hated him, and rightly so. So, a court subpoena? For you, Barret? Since I can't read, I was told you're asking for the money. Oh, yes, yes. I remember now. Don't you worry. It's just a formality. You wouldn't understand. I'll fix it for you. I'll go to the judge, and tell him that I agreed to give you more time. Is a year okay? Mr. Salvador, don't fool me. I wouldn't even think about it! Leave, rest easy and don't worry. You know I care for you all. Uncle Barret went to his cabin and continued working. One day, he was summoned to court and did not appear. He knew what that was, trouble. One day, he was told that later the law would go evict him, confiscating all he had for debt payment. They told him that he couldn't sleep in the cabin anymore. Uncle Barret didn't believe it, but in the afternoon, when he saw men dressed in black... Where are they going? Looks like they're looking for Uncle Barret. God! That's enough for a man to go nuts. Pascualo Guillot, known as Barret? Yes, sir. I come to enforce the court's orders. - Rosario! - Dad, come! - Let's see who dares! - Father! - No! - Leave me! Drop the gun! You want prison time? Move Pimentó! I can't! Even if you've gone crazy, I haven't! - Give me my shotgun! - Bandit! Thief! We can proceed. Come on. Sir, please, no! - No! - Please! At nightfall, it was all over. They'd been thrown out of the cabin. The farmers took the family in, but Uncle Barret couldn't, and didn't want to believe it. Hours later, he returned to his cabin. It was scabin. Scabin forever. Those walls had been built by his grandfather. The yard, the barn, the henhouse were the work of his father. The straw pile, so tall and lean, had been raised by him. It was all going to be someone else's, just because... just because an evil man wanted to. Let it all be damned! But, when going to burn his house, he felt horrified, as if his ancestors bodies were all standing before him. The craving for destruction lingered on his mind. Now, the fields that had been their executioners, would pay! He began to work with a fury that lasted several hours. Now the ground would be his bed and begging, his only job. Uncle Barret! Come on! Hey, Barret! Come have a drink with me! You thief! A drink! One more. One more. In his drunkenness, Uncle Barret couldn't take a tenacious memory off his mind. He saw an orange field that was more than an hour away between Benimaclet and the sea. He'd been there many times to speak with Mr. Salvador. He'd go and see if the devil was kind enough to let him stumble upon the master. Don't you worry. I'll fix it. By all means. You know I care for you all. - Barret! - You thief! I've got you now! Barret, no! I'll fix it in court. - Lies! - Keep the land. Pay me whenever! Liar! You won't fool anyone else! Barret, my son, drop that weapon! Uncle Barret died shortly after in Ceuta's prison, where he served his sentence. The daughters went to Valencia. The mother died in a hospital. The day of misfortune, it was vowed that these lands wouldn't be used by anyone else. And that's what happened. Mr. Salvador's sons tried to rent it but Pimentó made sure that the tenants resigned by fair means or foul ones. Years went by, but the orchard didn't forget the vow. Good morning, Uncle Tomba! Good morning to you! Has Pimentó woken up yet? Well, he hasn't exactly woken up... I saw him get up but I guess must have kept sleeping. What a catch you got, Pepeta! But does he work? You take care of the house and work yourself to death. It's worth it. Self-inflicted pain doesn't hurt. But it has an effect. It's a matter of luck. You see, poor Barret was also worth it. He worked here for fifty years and died in prison. But no one defends his memory, as much as my husband. That's true because he's courageous! Like me, when I was his age, n the war against the French. I would have liked to see the Pimentó there. He would've been a general. Maybe, I would've liked to see him. Not me, he'd very old now. Goodbye, Uncle Tomba! - Goodbye, girl! - Come on! Goodbye, handsomes! Come back at night. Charming! Milk lady! You have two pints? - Yes. - I'll be right back. Pepeta? Rosario? Is that you? I am. You didn't know? No. I heard the word but couldn't believe it. What a shame. If Uncle Barret saw you... His daughters were his pride. I'm not bad. Fate brought me here. Life has been cruel to me. It was all Mr. Salvador's fault. Damn him! Scoundrel! The whole family suffered because of his infamy. That's true. And what about our cabin? Nobody will dare touch it. Rest assured that our men will see to that. And if the men forget, Pimentó is there. He'll take care of it. He's such a man, my man. And what about your sisters? Like me, poor them. Margot, why are you taking so long? Now my name is Margot. Batiste, are we there yet? No woman, but we're pretty close. - Are you tired, Roseta? - No mother. - Good morning! - Good morning! - Kids, are you okay? - All good, mom. Pascualet? Obispo! Where are they going? Who knows? When you carry so much misery, you might as well go straight to hell. They come from hell already. Here. My God, look at this! We couldn't miss out on this, Teresa. Fertile land, without paying a single penny for two years, is our salvation. What a wreck! We've got work ahead of us! Wreck? Wreck is what we left up there, n those dry lands. This is fertile, Teresa. Look, pure gold. Our miseries are over. This wealth is well deserved. God help us. Go ahead, kids! Ramón, Pascualet, come and see! Pimentó! Pimentó! Pimentó! Oh, Pimentó, what I've seen! Has the sky fallen, Pepeta? Well, almost. And were you hurt? Yes, keep joking. A wagon with a whole family entered Uncle Barret's land. I saw furniture and tools. They'll work and stay! - What? - Look at them! There they are! Christ! Father! This will be your cathedral, Obispo. I've seen them! It is a family of gypsies. Wretches who haven't had a warm meal in their life. If they weren't about to starve, they wouldn't have risked their necks. I think the owners gave 'em 1000 bucks. They don't know anything. We'll all get weapons to throw them out or kill them. Leave them to me. I think I've proven that I can defend the orchard. Now, if someone wants to deal with this, I can step aside. I say this because people keep complaining about me. I think that the outsider s not a fearful man. Right, Juan Terrerola? Yes, he looks tough. You know certain things that Pimentó must take care of. That's right. I assure you, they won't be able to sleep at night. Batiste! Go away to bed, woman! No, Batiste. I can't sleep either. I feel as if I go to sleep, tomorrow all this might be a dream, and we'll wake up without food to eat, and without hope to have some. The same thing happens to me. Also, I'm afraid of the people, these farmers. They've been watching us. - It's curiosity, woman. - No, I see hate in their eyes. Outsiders are always frowned upon at first. Don't worry, we are finally on the right track. Go to sleep. Tomorrow we've got work to do. - What about you? - Me? I'll work, Teresa! I've got to work! Come one, woman! Come on! Batiste, look. Hey! Good man! Where are you going? You can't go through here. The land has been cultivated. Sorry, these days I've taken my sheep to Carraixet, and I don't know anything. - You're the new tenant? - Yes, sir. Misery brought you here, right? I see, I see. I was like that when I were young. I was in the war with the French and nothing stood ahead of me. But you've done wrong, my son, to lease this shaft. Trust me, leave. Leave before it's too late. Who sent you? Nobody. It's the advice of this old man, given in good faith. This land is cursed and it will be your ruin. I am an honest man. I came here to work and make a living for me and my family. Why do I have to leave? Because there's blood under this land, and when you dig, t will splash. Go away. The orchard is a terrible enemy. I'm not afraid. I defend myself against everything and everyone. I said it for your sake, but the youngsters today, gnore the old ones. In my day, t was not like this. Believe me, my boy, This land will be your and your family's ruin. Could it be true? These type of misfortunes only happen to cowards, and I'm not a coward. Have faith, Teresa. That cannot be tolerated! The poor old man pastured sheep there for twenty years and this outsider won't let him! Uncle Tomba was almost crying. It's not so bad. There's a lot of pasture for his sheep. He's old and fought the French. You can't do that to him! - You're right! - Of course! What do you say, Pimentó? All I can say is that once I see that scoundrel who cultivates what is not his, I'll say a couple words. Couple good ones. You know me. If you're going to, then it's time you do. Well, the guy does not leave the field. And we won't get him there. Something might happen to him as it can happen to anyone and then the law has a reason to suspect. Better if we don't make a fuzz. Get it? Okay, Pimentó! Have a little patience. I don't know what might happen to Batiste, but I'm sure he won't sow anything. Everything will go to hell. Get it? Very good! I win! Look how high I throw it! - Look! - Pascualet, come and play with us! Come here! - Don't be afraid! - Come, Pascualet! Come! Give me your hand! - Don't be afraid and grab me. - Quick! Quick! Obispo! Obispo! I've told you not to play in the water! Out! Come on! Hurry Kids! Go inside! Come on! Come on, run! Come on, don't be like that. You know you've been ill. Now smile. Come on! Batiste, son! Mother and sister will go to Mass, I'll shop for things n Valencia. Until I come back, you're the man in charge. Take care of everything. If something happens, the shotgun is behind the door. You understand? Yes, father. Good morning! Good morning! Good morning! Good morning! Hello, Tonet and Uncle Tomba! Morning, Tonet! Have a nice one, kids! Good morning! Hi! Good day! Hello, Uncle Tomba! Good morning! Shall we go in? Thank you, Mr. Borrul I congratulate you for caring about your children's education, the men of tomorrow. So, three children? No, I have five. The oldest of the boys helps me. The girl, the eldest of all, will go to the silk factory. Very well thought. The masters of my land promised it. Come in and see the temple walls where they will receive the gift of knowledge. Mrs. Pepa, open the school for us. It's open, Mr. Joaquin. My wife and I treat each other like this, not common between spouses, so the children learn to be polite from our example. Come in. Well, Mr. teacher, f they're not obedient, smack 'em. Don't worry... Some things stick better with this. Good. How much will you charge? My fee is one real per week to be paid every Saturday, but since they are three, I'll leave in two and a half. That's expensive, sir. Two reals for the three. Agreed. Those two reals are welcome. - I can't pay more... - Yes. - You know that I'm... - I know, yes. Next year will be different, but this year, the land will only give me work to do. Be warned. Already am, sir. I'm not a man to joke around. Tell me, why did you come here? Hunger, Mr. teacher. Like me. So, when do we start? Do not leave for tomorrow, what you can do today. - I cannot today. - Tomorrow then. - So, next Saturday... -Huh? - Nothing, nothing. Have a safe trip back, Mr. Borrull. Greetings to your wife and daughter. They were going to Mass. Thank you. Want to come here, Mr. Joaquin? Gladly, Mrs. Pepa. Oh my! The nerve! Saw these shameless people? We did, and we also saw some that look like men, but aren't. I'll go, Grandpa. Go on. We must talk to the priest. We can't let them enter the church. We can't be around those women. Who knows what they were before. Right? Those who do what that family does, aren't human. Here comes the priest. What happened, my dear little sheep? In the name of all women from the orchard, - Tell him. - Yes. We ask that you excommunicate those who moved into Uncle Barret's cabin, especially the women. I can't excommunicate, Pepeta. Well then, just don't let them enter the church. That I can do, but I won't, unless they sin and are deserving of it. What about the sin they are committing? Passions have always been a reason for scandals, and the church must always act with a clear head. Do not judge, or you will be judged, said Jesus. - Good morning! - Good morning! Hey! What are you doing with the gun? Guard the place, like my dad told me. When he's out, I'm the man. Leave that shotgun! Why? - I'm going in! Batiste, Batiste, lose the shotgun. Drop the gun! Is that man following you? - Do I shoot him? - Don't be a fool! Give me the gun now! Father told me I'm a man, to take care of women and children! Leave the gun! They'll see you with it! Yes, but that guy s still spying there. Go inside. And you say you're not a kid! Right Roseta? - Hello, Mr. Batiste. - Good afternoon, kid! - Hey! - What do you want? First, to say good afternoon, and then say a couple words. Speak. I've come to tell you to leave. - What? - Yeah, leave. No one should work those fields. We're willing to stop anybody. Trust me, take it as friendly advice. And why? Just 'cause you want? No, because we all want that. Because it is the orchards law. If you want more details, ask Mr. Salvador's sons Those who brought you here. Also, don't play dumb. You know as much as they do. Your actions are provocative. I don't know anything, and I'm not provoking anyone. I came to work and support my family, and no one can make me give up what's mine. I am a peaceful man, but when defending what's mine, I'm as brave as anyone else. Is that your final choice? Yes, definitely. You want war? You'll have one. Nice, Pimentó. Very good. - Bravo! Bravo! - Well said. - Father! - Father! - Now I'm back! - Father! Now, now, children. - Thank God! - Father! What, were you afraid? There was a man here. But mother didn't believe it. - Did you have good trip? - Yes, very. Roseta, it's settled. You start working at the factory tomorrow. You like it? Yes, father. You'll get to contribute to the house. You saw the masters? Yes, and they are very happy with us. I also saw the teacher. The kids start school tomorrow. Did you have any bad encounters? No, none. I saw Uncle Tomba's boy who greeted me affectionately. The only one... Well, is there anything for dinner? Sure! Come on! Come one, son! Table is set and everything... Where is she going? - Do we ask? - Leave her. - No, I'm asking. - Mother! Mother! - Good morning. - Hey you! Where are you going? - To the factory. - The factory? With us? Who put you up there in the factory? - My father. - Your father? - What you got there? - My lunch. - Let's see? - Let's see! Look how well she eats! Codfish, peppers and tomato! Girls! Like a queen! - Smells great! - How lucky! They must be millionaires. Nice! When the factory owner finds out, he'll ask you to share with him. Here, enjoy! Enjoy! Enjoy your meal! See you later! Goodbye! Enjoy it! What happened to you? I stumbled and dropped the basket. That's not true. It was them. I saw it. Here. Thank you. Where are you going so early? To the factory. I start working today. Should I wait for you later and walk you home? Thank you. I can take care of myself. It's not just because of that. Do you want to? Do you? Yes. - My name is Tonet. - I'm Roseta. I knew that. See you tonight, Roseta. Until tonight, Tonet. Mr. Bellopis, how many works of mercy are there? There's 27 works of mercy. Mr. Deperis, how many works of mercy are there? Two! What are the works of mercy? Doesn't anyone know? You're all beasts! To think that I treat you so nicely, like in a city school. Anyway, you have terrible examples. You are as dumb as your parents, who I don't want to offend. They work in the fields, They spare money to go to the bar, then make excuses not to give me the real that's mine. With God's help, you'll leave here as educated people, knowing how to handle yourself in society, as you've been lucky enough to find me as a teacher. Isn't that so? Mr. Joaquin, Mr. Batiste's children are here. Thank you, Mrs. Pepa. Let them through. - Good morning, Mr. teacher. - Good morning. - I'll do the enrollment. - Yes. - You, what's your name? - Pascualet Obispo. - What? - Borrull. Pascualet Borrull. Very good. Pascualet Borrull. - How old is he? - Four. - Four. And you? - Nicolas Borrull. Nicholas... They took Uncle Barret's cabin. Pigs! They'll pay! My father says they are thieves. Mine says they come from prison. They'll kill them f they don't leave. We'll beat 'em later, so they leave. Alright. Do you also want to study? No, Mr. teacher. I help my father. I've come to drop them off. Bye, Mr. teacher. Goodbye. Come. Gentlemen, I have the pleasure to present to you three new classmates. I hope you will be good friends. Let's see where you'll sit. There. That's perfect. It'll be too tight. Put them elsewhere. I said here! Move please! There! - I'll beat you on the way out. - Bring it! As my father will beat yours. Thieves! Hey! Order and composure! I, as the guardian of the canal, came to tell you that your turn s at five in the morning. I'm already up at that time every day. That was all. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Son! What happened? Nothing, father. I fell. My son, are you hurt? It's just a bump, mom. Come. Let me see you. Come! There are many falls like that in the orchards. Many! And some might fall, and never get up again. Maybe, but it wouldn't be the first one. Good afternoon. You were beaten, right? We beat each other. - How many were there? - Three. And why was the fight about? We were playing around and... - Don't play anymore, son. - No, father. Are the others at school? - Yes, mother, they're happy. - I'm scared. No woman. No. Poor things. This humble shack you should consider it a temple of courtesy and good nurturing. A temple I say? It's a torch! Without me, what would you be? Just beasts, no offence... Mr. teacher! The douchebat is pinching me! Who's Douchebat? Mr. Borrull, you mean. What a trashy mouth. In any case, it is "douchebag". It seems we're in a tavern! Okay... Enough! Class is over for today. Go on! Stand up! We thank you, Lord, because you light us with your light, And we pray so that what we have learned, we do not forget. Amen. Remember, I'm watching you. Don't steal fruit, jump ditches or throw stones. I have a little bird that tells me everything, and if I hear something bad, you will regret it. Go home, boy. Patan, Patan! Come here! Come on! Here they come. Come on! Let's get them! Patan! Patan! Isn't that the thieves' son who wanted to fight? It is. Let's see now. Right now! Hit him hard! Come on! He'll fall! Give it to him! Outside! Burglars! Go away thieves! Give him hell! Get up, Nicholas! Hit them hard, Ramon! Hit him! Hit them hard! Hit them! Leave him alone! Leave him alone! Hit him in the face! - Crook! - Get out of here! Let me go! One! Two! And three! Let's go boys! Come on! Run! Going! Pascualet! Run, run! Come on, hold on! Mom, Mom? It's okay, my son. It's okay. Villains! And Roseta, who has to walk alone? Thank you very much, Tonet, for walking me. Leave. My father could get upset. We're not doing anything. But he has never seen me with a man. - Well, that's why... - What? Nothing. Will you let me walk you tomorrow? No, Tonet. People would start talking. You saw how the girls mocked us when they saw us together. Don't listen to them. Why do you want to walk with me? I don't want anything to happen to you. - Why? - Because... Because I think I'm going to like you, Roseta. Do I wait for you tomorrow? Roseta! What are you doing here?! Go home! Go home! - What are you looking for? - Nothing, Mr. Batiste. So what then? Didn't want her to walk alone and came with her. Why does it matter to you? It's just that I care and I am a good man. Good evening, Mr. Batiste. Good night, Tonet. - What are you doing? - Watering. This outsider thinks he can water at any time. I water when you told me to. Liar! I said two and it's five now You told me at five. At what time did I give Canet his turn? At five o'clock. There. Am I a fool to give the same time to both of you? Man, you're the best scheduler in the orchard. Jesus! You said five, and I'll water no matter what! Well, water, but they'll be consequences. This water belongs to Canet. Scoundrels! They want to end us, my son, but don't know who I am. Let's water! This morning, a sheriff came to summon me to the Water Court tomorrow at eleven. Have you committed any infractions? Infractions? Any offence regarding irrigation? No. No, sir. I'm sure. Then it's to give you the rules of duties and rights as waterer. Since you are an outsider... But I was told to go to the door of the Apostles Call Cathedral and I wanted to ask, that's a mistake right? It should be in court. No, sir. you are wrong. According to a custom that dates back five centuries the Water Court meets at the door of the cathedral every Thursday, shortly before noon. This tribunal, which has been operating since the Arab domination in Spain, s the only remaining testimony of patriarchal justice. The sentences are ssued on the spot. Fast and secure justice without secretaries or paperwork. The working class respect these judges, whose deliberation doesn't admit appeal. Each judge represents one of the seven canals that come from the Turia River, the nurturing river of beautiful Vega in Valencia. Make way for the Court! Water! Water! Favara canal, Rovella canal. Tormos canal, Rascaña, Mestalla, Cuart of Faitanar and Mislata! A deure... The court opens! - A deure. - Aguileta. Don't be surprised, Mr. Borrull, if the president points with his foot to give someone the floor. It's an old Arab custom that still lives on. You, speak. I denounce Benito Cuellar, because, he continued watering even after his turn, Benito Cuellar, you speak. It's true, there was a spot left to water. The court will sentence. Benito Cuellar will pay a five pesetas fine. Very good! Guardian of the Favara canal, Mr. Antonio Llull, aka Pimentó against Batiste Borrull. You, speak. I denounce this man because as an outsider, he believes the water schedule is a joke. I told him to water at two and he did it at five, surely, 'cause he overslept. - That's a lie! - Silence! After I told him to stop, he ignored me and threatened me. Lies and more lies! If you don't keep due respect, we will set a fine. But this man is lying. Silence! Do you have witnesses, guardian? Yes, Mr. President. Pimentó says the truth. - It's true! - Everyone is lying. There can't be justice like this! I'm the only honest one here, and if the court trusts liars... Five pesetas fine, Batiste Borrull, for disrespecting the court! Very good! Very good! Mr. President, this man, and everyone else in the orchard are my enemies. They want me out of my land, They want to kill my crops, my family's food. They hate me. He told me to water at five and not two. It's a lie that he gave me a warning, or that I threatened him. I swear on my children your Honor... Do you have witnesses? I'm telling you these men... Answer my question. No. I am an honest man. I've never lied. I'm telling the truth here! Scabin up! The court's ruling is: Batiste Borrull will pay twenty pesetas as penalty and five as fine. Very good! Long live the court! That's awful! Justice was served! He's badly ill, Batiste. Badly, Teresa. Badly... Our boy is dying. Our crops are dying. Many days without watering... Oh, Mother Mary! There's no justice in heaven. No, there is none, Teresa. None! No more justice than the one taken by our hands. Batiste! Batiste! Let's water! Let's water! - Batiste, and the court?! - I said to water. Yes! Let's water! Let's see who stops me! Batiste, but... Oh, son! Batiste had a fierce attitude, guardian of his harvest, a desperate hero of the struggle of life such a resolution was found in that black ghost to shoot whoever showed himself, that no one dared to show up and his fields drank for an hour without protest. And strangely enough, the following Thursday, Pimentó didn't make him before the Water Court. The orchard had learned that the only valuable thing in Batiste's cabin was a double-barreled shotgun and its owner, a real man. He's not worse, but not better either. But he'll be saved, right, doctor? Chances are getting worse and worse. Anyway, I will return tonight. I will do my best, believe me. Thank you for everything, Doctor. See you tonight. My son, my poor little boy! Woman, do not cry. How unfortunate we are! Go, go in with him. And you? I will continue working. What are you doing, Roseta? Nothing, mother. But you're dressed up. It's Sunday. A sad Sunday, daughter. I planned to go to the queen's fountain, to bring fresh water. Didn't you see Tonet when you went to Mass? No ma'am. Daughter, go. Distract yourself a little. What if I am needed? Water is also needed. You can wait, but you won't see him. You won't. Do you know who she's waiting for? I don't. Her boyfriend. If she has boyfriend. It's Tonet, old Tomba's grandson, the shepherd. She's the Divine Shepherdess. She will not marry Tonet. You'll see. Because Tonet is disgraceful and starving. You pose as honest, but you are part of a family of thieves. Who are you calling a thief? Who? Who else would it be? Your father. My Uncle Pimentó knows, and everyone knows it. You came to steal, kicked out of your town as thieves. My father? My father a thief? Say that again and I'll break your face. Your father, who was in prison! Hit her! Take this! Here! Take this! You should be ashamed! - Let's go! - Come on! This is the last row. There's no more light, and we can't have crooked rows or people will laugh at us, right, Batiste? Batiste! Batiste! Batiste, run! Run! - Oh, Batiste! Pascualet is... - No! Yes. Oh, Batiste! My son! Oh, Batiste, my king! No! My king! No! No! King of the heavens! No! Did you leave the horse alone? Go get it. Something may happen to it. How many times do I have to tell you? Run, run... Pascualet! Son of my life! Oh, my sunshine! My son! - Has he died? - Yes. Morrut! Morrut! Poor Morrut! Father! Father! - Morrut has blood! - God! God! When I came to the cabin, I saw some men on the way, laughing and singing. Morrut, you too? Poor Morrut! I'll get you, Pimentó. I swear, you'll pay for them all! Pimentó, thief! Coward, come out! Come out and fight like a man! Murderer, come out! - No! - Get out, you thief! He's insulting me! He's fighting back! Let me out and I'll show him! Don't go. Can't you see he's crazy? - Move! - Pimentó! You coward! Murderer! Pimentó, get out! You cornered him like a wild beast! That man is ready for anything! Think! Pimentó! Come on! Come out, you coward! Come out! Coward, come out! Scoundrel! Pimentó, you coward! Murderer! Pimentó! Come out! Coward! Pimentó! Thief! Pimentó! Pimentó! Poor Batiste. What are you doing here? I understand your pain, my son. I warned you about it all. Why do they hate me? I am an honest, hardworking man. Why are they after me? It's 'cause I'm an outsider. Don't you know about this cabin's curse? Mr. Salvador's heirs didn't tell you when they brought you here? That's so cruel! My poor son! Stay calm, Batiste, so that you don't end up as poor Barret and end up in prison. If only I had known. Why didn't they tell me? I'll gather the crops that have been watered with my son's blood and I will leave. You'll do well, Batiste. These lands should remain cursed forever. Do not be ashamed, mourn, but believe me, my son, these lands are cursed, and will bring misfortune. We have good, rested soil and water for it. We'll have a lot of work, Batiste. These lands are our salvation. Our miseries are over. This will be your cathedral, Obispo. News of Pascualet's death spread quickly and shook the whole orchard. It seems that with his passing, a small thorn grew in the conscience of them all. - I'm sorry for your loss. - My condolences. - I'm sorry, Mr. Batiste. - You see, Mr. Batiste? Yesterday, all these people spoke badly about you and today, they enter your home with confidence and overwhelm you with affection. - I'm very sorry Mr. - Misfortune makes them forget. My condolences. I share your sadness, Mr. Batiste. Believe me, deep down they are good. Savages, yes. Capable of the greatest atrocities, but with a heart that doesn't fit their chest. Not her, Mister! Not her! Why not? She came to pay tribute to your child. I share your sadness, Batiste. I know the pain of being childless, so I know what losing one must feel like. Thank you. Now, only Pimentó hasn't come to this house. - She came, he will too. - You're right, Pimentó. Jesus! I know! I know I'm right! That poor boy's passing pains me, as if he was my own. Barret was a long time ago. They have the right to live. - I always thought the same. - Me too. We all did, but no one did anything. Last night I was about to have a gun fight with Batiste, but Pepeta told me that the boy had died, and I allowed him to call me a coward. - Well done, Pimentó. - And you going to the funeral? - Of course. - Me too. - Me too. I'll bring him music. A good funeral is always great comfort to parents. Batiste, I'm sorry with all my heart, Batiste, no hard feelings? No hard feelings. Goodbye, my son. In all his sadness, Batiste, in the middle of his fields began to realize his new situation. Vega was the same as always, but he seemed bigger, infinite. Batiste, like the late uncle Barret, He felt the abundance of the land and thanked God for living peacefully in paradise. That's why, according to the stories, the Moors cried when they were thrown away. People no longer hated him, no longer chased his kind, They had been under this roof, erased the curse of that land with their footsteps. He was starting a new life. But at what price? Do you like this one? It repairs your rows and looks like a beautiful lady. You pay for traveling? - Hey! I can assure you won't find this elsewhere in Spain. I can assure that much. It's a treasure of an animal. You have an eye for good things It's cheap! I think you won't miss out. Boy! Take the horse for a walk so he can see it. Go boy! Come on! Ole! Ole! - I'm still impressed! - It's a beauty! - Oh! Ole! - Ole! Look! Look! You saw it walk? Clean as a whistle! No one is being fooled here. Everything is natural. The animals here are not like in other places that age in a heartbeat. Have you already seen the strength? Can pull a wagon. More thrust than an elephant. How much? Since you're a friend, and a nice person, I'll leave it at forty-dollars. Deal? Well, since it's for you I'll ask even less. Twenty-five? Good God! Just twenty-five? Have you seen the animal? That's like stealing. I give twenty-five! Only twenty-five? Boy! Take her out again, so he can take a good look! Can't you see? She's a beauty! Let her pick up some speed. - What a mane! - See that trotting? It literally looks like a marquise at a ball. Is that worth twenty-five for you? - Not another coin. - Boy! Bring her! Enough already. It's the best horse and he doesn't want to... Well sir? What's your name? - Borrull Batiste. - Batiste! Bateque! Well, you see, Mr. Bateque, you do realize I do want this jewel to be yours, I'll do something great for you. Does thirty-five sound good? Of course it is! I swear we wouldn't do this, not even for family! Does this pearl nspire you that little? Can't you just appreciate it? Hey, boy! Take it out again. Come one, girl! Go! I leave it at thirty-three. Twenty-eight. Mr. Batiste, you're one of my own! Listen! Thirty! And I swear I'm not making profit! Don't say no, 'cause I'll go mad. You're taking the best. Today has been good, for you Mr. Batiste. You woke up with the right foot, and won the lottery. - Yes, sir! - There my friend! - Thank you. Until the day I saw you I had my eyes closed I had my eyes closed But you came along and I opened them And yours blinded me And yours blinded me A handful of sun And another of cinnamon And another of cinnamon God used to create The Valencian Women To create the Valencian Women. Thank you, Tonet. - Mass tomorrow? - Yes. Good evening, Mr. Batiste. Good night, ma'am. - Good night, Tonet. - Let's go guys. What a beautiful night! San Juan's night. Who would know a few months ago, that we would have this peace and wealth? Do you remember our arrival? We were seven then and now we are only six, Batiste. Pimentó! The Cathedral's Miguelete Has opened like a grenade Has opened like a grenade It was the worker's fault It was the worker's fault Who made it reluctantly Who made it reluctantly The Cathedral's Miguelete Great! What's the bet? You know already. Whenever and however you want. - Whenever you want! - Tomorrow works for us. Tomorrow, when I get back from paying the master! - Paying? - Well, telling her that I'm not paying. But I'll certainly be here. I won't miss it. - You never pay? - Never. If the ma'am or her daughters, with their many hair bows want to be paid, then they can come and work like I do. How did you get them to leave you alone? You see, I go, the fat lady, the girls and their hair bows come out, I tell 'em I don't have a cent, they tell me I'm a scoundrel, then tell 'em that my grandpa, who was a very wise man, always said "Who were the chains made for"? For the men! If you pay, you're a good person. You don't, then you're a rascal. Then I do this: I pull out my knife and I start to cut my cigar. And they let you go? They've told me to spare myself the visits! But I don't! I don't want them saying that I don't deliver. Sure! And you never pay! You come to pay, right? It's time. You know how much you owe? Ten semesters! Ten! Well to pay, pay... Well, no. Because I don't have any money, and without money, how would I pay? That's because you're a drunk, a bum and a scoundrel. Look, master, ma'am, My grandfather, who was a very wise man, always said: Who were chains made for? For men! I know it by heart, but that's enough. No more stories! Just pay! - Mrs. Manuela, look... - No more! I've let you cause I have good heart, but that's over, you rascal! Either you pay me or leave the land! Leave the land? Me? There are plenty of honest men who want it! No one in the orchard dares to go in my cabin. You'll see that there are, so keep that to yourself and go get the money! Soon, soon! Mrs. Manuela, I do want to pay. Then don't talk and pay up! Leave, we don't have anything else to say! - But Mrs.- - Leave! - Go! - Listen to me. - Go away! - Ma'am! - My regards to Batiste! But... Batiste taught us that he's not as fierce as he looks. - Father! Mother! - Mother! Father! Where were you? At the park. I beat all of 'em to the slope! Roseta! Come on, girl! Let her dress up, Mrs. Teresa. Girls today like to show off. Well, remember yourself at her age. Two hours putting on a topknot. Liar. Mr. Batiste, know what Pimentó and the Terreolas did? No, what have they done? Nothing. Pimentó bet he'd drink more firewater than those two together. They're still n the tavern, drinking nonstop. - Really? Gross! - That's nothing. Once, Pimentó spent two days eating pudding and drinking. All the men from the orchard are there. Why don't you go? - No, I don't... - I'm ready. Praise the most beautiful girl, n all orchards in the world. - Fool! - Where are you going? To the farm dance and then back. - Very good! - Very good! - Okay? - Everything about you is okay. Blessed be your voice. Bye! - See you later! - Bye! - Have fun! - Thank you! You still have no girlfriend, Batiste? I'm hesitating between three interested girls. Well, there goes a peseta for you to throw heads or tails. That Pimentó, s a great guy after all. A lost person. I would like to see that bet. For what? Woman, it's time I get a moment to distract myself. I've earned it honestly. Go then. I'll sleep a little. Don't be late. I'll be quick. I'll be back soon. - Go! - Come on! Okay! Those are beautiful shots! - Who's next? - I am! How did it go with your master? She's lost her respect for me. Laugh, laugh now. You won't later. If she disrespects me, what will happen to you? They're changing. They're becoming more unpleasant. - That's true! - Right! - Yes, sir! - And you know why? 'Cause they're no longer afraid of us. And you know why? - Why? - Damn! It's 'cause Barret's fields have crops! - It's true! - It's true! Masters want revenge now, for all we put them through, because a starving thief knew how to play us all. Right! My master wanted full payment of the semester. - Mine is worse! - The owners have changed. - All of 'em. - Whose fault is it? A dumb outsider who came and changed things. Just him! That's because there's no more men in the orchard. That's why he's still alive! Go away! Go away or I'll kill you! You won't go? You won't go? I beg you to stay calm. Stay back! I'll kill him! Miserable thief! - Land stealer! - He's not been badly hurt! Batiste lost all hope of living peacefully there. The whole orchard rose against him again. Once again he isolated himself in the cabin, lived like a caged beast facing threats from afar. The kids stopped going to school, Roseta stopped going to the factory and Batiste never stepped out of his fields. The only one who left was their father. He felt safe carrying the shotgun under his arm They all stared at him but he never heard an insult. Sometimes he saw Pimentó from afar, but he fled, fearing the encounter perhaps more than Batiste, or waiting for his chance. - Good afternoon, Uncle Tomba. - Hello, Batiste. What are you doing here? Looking for dinner for my family Got it now! No, you come out to challenge the orchard, to tell them you're not afraid of them, that you're braver than everyone. And what do you want, for me to chicken out? No. I need their respect so they leave me alone. You are wrong. You are wrong. I was a peaceful man, but they want war and war that's what they'll get! What else could I do? Get out of this land, Batiste. You still have time, believe me. It's too late. Trust me, Batiste. Never. Then you're the one to blame for what happens to you. Go to your cabin. It's almost nightfall. Don't hunt anymore. I couldn't even if I wanted to. I only have two cartridges left. Then go and take care. Good afternoon, Uncle Tomba. Thank you for your interest. Lord, Oh, Lord... Less crying, kids, t's nothing, just a scratch. Don't say a word about what you saw! Want me to call a doctor? No doctors or anything! Don't involve the law. Who was it? I think it was Pimentó, but whoever it was, I'll get him. Tonet, go see if you hear what happened to Pimentó, and tell me. Right now. I think you've chosen well, Roseta. There, there, kids. It's okay. Calm down, woman. Pepeta, hurry! You felt it, right? - You were friends with him? - You doubt it? Leave it to us, Pepeta. Men's battles are fought between men. We just want our own justice. Avenge him and I'll believe you. I don't want your tears! I do not want feelings! I pray, I demand that the orchard avenges him. Pimentó died for us! Vengeance! Teresa, I didn't want to kill him. I was just defending myself. He wanted to kill you. He shot first. But it pains me that he's dead. It hurts! Rest well. Sleep. You better go, Tonet. I'm like family, f you want me... For me, you are family, t's better if you go and nobody knows that you were here. Who knows what will happen to us tomorrow? Whatever happens to you, t will happen to me too. Thank you, my son. See you tomorrow. These lands are cursed, Batiste. And they'll be your ruin. These lands are cursed, and will be your ruin! These lands are cursed, and will be your ruin! These lands are cursed, and will be your ruin! Forgive me, Pimentó . Forgive me. I've killed, it's true. Let me go, Pimentó ! Don't touch me! It's not my fault. It's not my fault! You came for me! Don't crush me! It hurts! Pimentó, where are you taking me? No! I don't want to. To hell? Smoke! Smoke! Fire! To hell? No! No, Pimentó! No! Teresa! Fire, woman! Get up! - Kids! Rosetta! - Children! Roseta, my daughter! Get up! The cabin is burning! Come on, boys! Fire! Kids! Go down, kids! Hurry! Father, hurry! Come on! Run! Run, Batiste! Come on! Hurry! My house! No! No! Pascualet! Come! Batiste! Batiste! Batiste! Batiste! Batiste! - Batiste! - Son! Come on! Jump! Jump, you mutt! Jump! Oh no, Batiste!
