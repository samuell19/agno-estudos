You want to take away all the money? You want to portray me as the villain by calling him 'brother.' Why don't you get the hell out of my house now? What?! What?! How did it happen? lt's impossible! Listen to him. Listen! Danny! Danny! Danny! Danny, l'm yet to find someone more idiotic than you. l was trying to win your lost battle. Gyanesh, has to be conquered with love, not threats. Stupid! This scene was needed. lf you've lost your votes, l've gained some. We're partners, not brothers. l appreciate you. lf only l had a partner like you. Sukamna, you've dialed the wrong number. l'm characterless, but not so less. Listen. - Tell me. When you turn characterless, don't forget to inform me. Sure! Bala! Happy birthday, brother. "Happy birthday to you, Gyanesh." "Happy birthday to you, Gyanesh." "Happy birthday to you, Gyanesh." "Happy birthday!" "Happy birthday!" "Happy birthday to you." When dad was alive, they would never celebrate my birthday. Now see.. l'm getting scared, uncle Mirza. What such thing did dad do that.. When dad was alive, these people wouldn't even come near me. Look, you don't need to be afraid of anybody. l'm feeling suffocated here, uncle Mirza. l'll come to stay with you tomorrow. Everybody is a liar. No, l was just lying. You aren't lying, Gyanesh. You're right! They're all fools. Frauds! l don't know how you manage to live with them. l've decided, Gyanesh. l'm leaving tomorrow. Where to? To my world of music. Where beauty and divinity lies. Austria. Yes, yes. Take care, Gyanesh. - Ok. Heard me, take care of yourself. For God's sake, Gyanesh! - Ok, ok. You've no idea how bad l'm feeling! Despite being your brother, l'm unable to do anything for you. What do l do? l'm under compulsion, Gyanesh. Goodnight! Goodnight?! He said goodnight? Don't worry, l'm not leaving today. l'm leaving tomorrow, at 6.30 in the evening. He's not even listening! Even l want to go to that world of music.. ..where there's beauty and divinity. No, you've to live in this world where there's uncle.. .and uncle Mirza and where Danny is. Aren't you my brother? - Yes, but l'll leave you behind. Now? What do l say now? Be ready at 6.30. - Gyan! Let's go, c'mon! Pull your pant a little down.. you've tied it very high. Deven! Hi! Hi! Hi! - Hi, Ms. Anu. Ms. Anu, my elder brother Gyanesh. Anu, for you.. Hi! He's told me everything about you over the phone. Welcome to Austria! And you're Anushka? - Yes. You're a musician at the Prague orchestra? - Yes. And his colleague? Colleague? Colleague! And my friend too. Friend? - Yes, friend. Friend! - Friend.. friends! Deven, you were right. This land is enriched with music.. ..and the melody of beauty. Lo! The melody of beauty! Shall we go? - Yes, let's go. lt'll be fun! Bring my bag. C'mon! Bring my bag?! lsn't it too quiet in here? l've heard that you sing lndian classical very well. l do sing, but nobody listens. We'll listen to you. - Really?! Why not? - Then l'll sing. Do you pray every morning? Yes, l do. After my bath. After your bath? Even l pray after my bath. ls it? - Yes. What's your favourite game? My favourite game.. Snakes and ladders. Snakes and ladders! Even l like that game. Good! - Good! Who all are there in your family? Only my father! l don't even have a father. Why? - And nobody else? No. Just me and my friend, Bala. Now we too are there with you. Good! Good! Good! l'm so happy that Deven brought you along. l'm also happy.. ..that l met you. Gyanesh, we've an international music show on the 30th. You'll be impressed when you see it. lt's going to be a big flop because their.. ..Hindi lead singer Shankaran has disappeared. l know! He betrayed us. Anushka, can l sing in your show? No. - You savour butter, pickle and bread. Their show is huge, Gyanesh. We're too small for their show. Ok. - Deven, but.. But.. you also should savour the butter, pickle and bread. C'mon, eat.. eat and put on some weight. Gyanesh went abroad with Deven overnight. And l'm not even aware of it! l'm his uncle after all Sir, he sought uncle Mirza's permission. Uncle Mirza? He's a lawyer. He loves pulling strings. One puppet being Deven.. ..and the other, Danny. Danny is a fighter. Fighter! Brave fighter! You're a stupid fighter. But a beautiful one. l love you too, babe. You're stupid but your brother isn't. Why? He'll take away 100% of Gyanesh's share. l bet. Yes, partner. Sazia, was telling me that you took away the.. ..golden goose without informing. Yes, it's laying eggs here. Do you want some? Are you eating them all by yourself? Partner, you placed your faith in me. Trust me and don't call me. l'll call you. Bye. l tell you, Deven is a crook. l didn't tell daddy that you're here and that l'm with you. Very good. Do another good deed now. - Yes? Spend a lot of time with Maureen's group. You told me that your brother is mentally ill.. ..and that you've brought him here for treatment. l'm trying to help you out, why are you getting upset? lf you try to help me then l'll become mentally ill. But.. l.. - What? No, don't ask questions. Just leave. Why can't you smile and say that? - l can't. Then l won't go. - You won't? You won't? Then l'll leave. Deven, is quick to lose his temper. Where had you been? - To catch butterflies. See! Wow! lt's written here that if you don't become a billionaire.. ..in 40 days, then you won't even look at Anushka. And l'll repeat once again, l'll marry you only if dad permits. "Smile, wherever you are, keep smiling." "Touch me, like the rays of the sun." "The childlike glee of yours." "l feel your presence in me." "Touch my lips with yours." "Smile, wherever you are, keep smiling." "The childlike glee of yours." "l feel your presence in me." "When lost in my thoughts, it often happens." "That l feel fragrant when l think of you." "Your fragrance sates my soul." "l lose control of myself when l touch you." "ln your eyes." "There's magic in your eyes." "Smile, wherever you are, keep smiling." Do you want to sing? Yes, yes, yes. Come! "My locks are entangled." "Detangle them, O beloved." "My locks are entangled." "O enchantress." "O enchantress, you entice me." "O enchantress, you entice me." "O enchantress, you entice me." "O enchantress." "O enchantress." "O enchantress." Deven! Gyanesh.. Thank you! Don't ask me what's wrong. lf it's wrong, it's just wrong. - What's wrong? Not again! He's your brother. You've brought him here for treatment. And then l notice that he's a music lover, too. He's a lover. That's the problem, he's a lover. What's the problem? l want to bring both of you closer. You're misleading him. l've brought him here for some other reason. Keep him away from your music group. But he can add magic to our music. Can't you see that he's a genius? Yes, he's a genius and l'm stupid. No, you're jealous. - Yes, l'm jealous too. You're insecure. - Yes, l'm insecure. Selfish! - Yes, l'm selfish too. Anything else? Watch out! Where's he going? lndian. Classical! Good, good, good? Excuse me! Who's the driver of this car? What's the matter? This car has dashed against another car.. ..and the driver ran away. So? We want to arrest the driver. Are you the driver? Yes. lt's me! Ok, then come with us to the police station. Come, come. Slowly! Hello! - Are you Deven? - Yes. Your brother Gyanesh has been arrested for hitting a car. Please report to the police station now. l'll be there. You mean to say it was not his car? Yes, l was driving the car and the car was in my name. And he wasn't there at the time of the accident. Then why didn't he tell us so? Because he's my brother. So what? He's an lndian, brother. He loves me! He's unwell. - Ok Shall we go, dad? l know you won't forgive me, brother. But l've brought this gift for you. l've downloaded photographs, videos and songs.. ..of you me and dad, since childhood, in this.. So that you can keep it with you. ls this for me? - Yes, for you. This reminded me of both my brothers. That's why l came here to apologise to my brothers. Danny! - Hi, Deven. Gyanesh, there are two kinds of people who seek an apology. One, those who apologise and never repeat that mistake. ..and then those who apologise.. ..and prepare for the next battle. l belong to the first category, brother. And l belong to the second category. The one who prepares for the next battle. lt's not that, brother. Only now have l realized what a brother means. And l still haven't realized what a brother means. You'll never even realize it. l've heard that a brother isn't a brother but a partner. A partner! But what if a partner pretending.. ..to be a brother plays tricks? Then he isn't called a brother, brother. What is he called, Gyanesh? Trickster! Conman! Fraud! Your brother has grown up amongst the tricksters in casinos. What are you both talking about? We're getting rid of brotherly differences. l forgot to tell you, Gyanesh. This younger brother of ours.. ..calls me up all day and night. He wants to apologise to you. Won't you forgive him? Why won't l? Now he must've realized that relationships are important. Yes. That's why he has brought such a big file in this. Yes. Say thank you to him. Thank you. To him. - Thank you! - Thank you! Love you. - Love you! Kiss him. Kiss. Better. Hug him. A bigger hug. - Danny! Enough. Enough! Danny, now show your brother around. Entertain him. Hug him. And then let me know how you feel. Where are we going? - For sightseeing. To rebuild a broken bond. You won't call a lawyer, will you? You are very short-tempered. - Not anymore. After dad's demise, l've changed a lot. Really! But where are we going? There's a place called Crystal World in Austria. Do you remember, dad used to bring us here when we were young? Here? - Yes, he used to. Do you remember, when you wanted to click a photo.. ..with Deven's camera, he had slapped you at this very place. ls it? - And he trashed you so much. Really? - Yes, really Look, how it's changing colours? Yes, just like how Deven changes colours. l love you, brother! Hi, brother. - What's this? A man flying in the sky. Even you used to fly. Uncle used to say so. l used to, brother, but dad taught me to walk on ground. Father was a great teacher, he used to teach everybody. Yes indeed, he taught me a lot, brother. Hello! Luitang! Hey what's up, my Godfather?! Been a long time, my friend! Just a second. Bob, take brother to the Hill-view restaurant. - Ok. l'll finish my business talk and meet up with you, brother. Yes, mate. l'll surely call you back this week. Alright, man. l'll call you back. Danny, if you thought this woman would ever leave you.. ..you'd be stupid. How the hell are you here? Because people bother me for your dues. Come here, you little pussycat. Danny! Danny! Look, even l'm flying. Danny! Gyanesh! Are you crazy?! lt's great fun! Fun! Bob, where are you? Deepu, you idiot! How did he go up there? You were on your way to Hill-view restaurant. What do l do? He was insisting. lf he dies then Sikander Mirza will ruin me. l'll be finished. Danny! Take my photo. - l'm coming. This Dev will get me killed someday. "Lord Ram has a flying chariot." Danny! Danny, look how fast l'm flying. Danny! Deven, please help! Gyanesh, wait a minute! Good, good, good! Best of luck, partner. Keep this bag of.. ..lndian values with you, Dev. Had he died.. ..we'd have been killed too. Why? You were too eager to come here. Have you gone weak in your knees? You know, you're a very smart guy, Dev. Oh really? You want him to die in an accident.. ..that too because of me.. ..so that you can become the 100% owner of the entire property. lsn't that what you wanted? Yes! That's what l want. That l become the 100% owner of the property. Because l can do so with love, and you cannot. This isn't a gambling deal in a casino.. ..but a war among brothers. So let me do my work. And you back-off! l am high. Dev! What's this? - This is beer. Even papa used to drink this beer and call everybody dear. The specialty of this thing is that.. ..people become dear to God if they drink it alone and.. ..people come closer when they drink it together. Deven, when l drink this.. - You keep peeing. l feel butterflies in my tummy. - What butterflies? Anushka! Anushka! She's a very nice girl. She's a Goddess. A Goddess. And you know the meaning of my name is God. You know she says, there's a show on the 30th of September.. ..and if we win that show.. ..then l'll be one of the best singers in the world. And lndian music will become famous throughout the world. And after that.. you know.. Shall l tell you something honestly? Tell me. - You're my brother, so l like to be honest with you. You tell me first, then l'll tell you a truth. You tell me first. You tell me first. No, you tell me first. Who's the eldest? - Yes, l'm the eldest. Then you tell me first. l feel something when l see Anushka. You feel something? Where do you feel it? Only there, right? Why have you become quiet now? You're very innocent, brother. Don't innocent people get married? - They do. Shall l tell you something honestly? - Tell me. Have a sip first. One more! Anushka is your future sister-in-law. l'm going to get married to Anushka. This game, this drama, is all for her. Why didn't you tell me about Anushka on the very first day? l told you now, let's go home. Let's go home. Hey brother! - You're hiding something from me. Gyanesh, l've already told you everything honestly.. ..now let's go home. l won't come home unless you tell me the inside story. The inside story? The inside story! You want to know the truth? - Yes. - Then listen. l've cheated you. l've betrayed you. - Why? For what? Why? For what? Because you have money and l don't. Because father loved you and hated me. Because l love Anushka. Because her dad wants a rich son-in-law. Because l thought that after dad's death.. ..l'd get a small share of his wealth. And l can seek Anushka's hand in marriage from her dad.. Marry her According to father's will, all the wealth has gone to you.. ..and we're left with nothing. Gyanesh, you're the Prince. The heir! And Sikander Mirza is the Lord. Uncle Mirza? - Yes. Your uncle Mirza who has made such papers.. ..that we can't even fight for our cause. But what's there? What difference does it make? What's happening, uncle Mirza? When a good man departs, are his children sent to hell? l'm asking you, uncle Mirza! Only a lawyer like you can create such documents.. ..not my father. Whatever is there, l want all of us brothers to share it equally. Else l don't want anything. l don't want anything. Wonderful! When my brothers are turning to be good. They're coming closer to me, you're snatching them away from me. That's not fair, uncle. That's not fair! Change all the documents. Shred them to pieces. Families aren't made of legal papers. They're made of bonds of love. Yes, l'm drunk. l drank a lot and l drank with Deven. And he told me everything honestly. You and l aren't doing the right thing. l'm telling you, this isn't right. l call you back. Hello uncle! Not uncle, attorney Sikander Mirza. Please sit down! Shocked to see my sudden appearance? Sikander Mirza is such a person! l've taken a flight from London to come to you. Just to tell you one thing. Look into my eyes. Listen carefully and understand. The game that you're playing will prove deadly for you. And if it isn't deadly then Sikander Mirza can make it so. lf you ever try to get Gyanesh drunk again.. ..or play any such game, then l'll ruin you. l've the power. l have the power! l understand that you're wise, intelligent and clever. And also a little crooked. Bye! Your father was a close friend of mine. He was God's good man. Hence, l'd like to tell you something. You've only seen Gyanesh's pocket.. ..not the heart behind it. Look into it one day, pal, you'll feel good! A brother is a brother, Deven. Just embrace him with love once.. ..it'll be blissful. That too, when one has Gyanesh for a brother. Deven, we had trapped a similar blue butterfly.. ..in childhood and shown it to dad. You know, dad's song is also recorded in it. Our photos and dad's too. Do you want to see it? Gyanesh, he's your father, not mine. Why do you say so? You're my brother. Give it, l'll delete the photo. - No, no. You're angry, aren't you? But you're wrong. Father used to remember you a lot during his last days. He even used to cry saying that Deven left me.. ..my family has broken. All of them have gone far away. Gyanesh, relationships that have broken, have broken. Just you and l are here. So we'll only talk about ourselves. But.. - No papa. No father. No dad or daddy please. For my sake. Okay. "Life.. O life.. what was lacking?" "Why are the eyes still moist in the corner?" Let's play! "Life.. O life.. what was lacking?" "Why are the eyes still moist in the corner?" "Where did you disappear?" "Where did you disappear?" "Nobody came, it was noon already. Nobody came." "Life.. O life." Gyanesh's mental case history that l have here. lt's a case of autism. His mental growth stopped in childhood. But doctor, when Gyanesh sings.. lt's called genius disorder. What? - Genius disorder. We call it William's syndrome. The musical talents of such people are unmatched. They can compose their own music and sing it too. Such people are very simple. And in no way are concerned about rupees, dollars or pounds. l won! l won! Deven, l won! l caught the thief. l won! - Yes, you won! Hey baby.. great show. Sorry, Danny. Luitang has ordered you not to enter the casino. Who's going to stop me? l'll stop you - Get the hell out of my way! Stop! - Danny, please. Do you know who you're talking to! l'm the prince here. - Prince?! You were. Not anymore! l'm the prince - Danny! - l always have been the prince. You freaking maggot! - Let's go. Who'd you think you're freaking talking to? You tell Luitang that l'm going to see him soon. Where are you going, man? Your membership is cancelled. - Stay in your limits, man! And you too! Hey what happened? - l don't know. Hey Robert! How could you cancel my membership of this club? l'm the best flying bull out here. So what? You'll have to clear your dues first. Sorry! Time decides everything, son! You'll have to leave this house on the 30th of September. Because this house is now in Gyanesh's name. Not anybody else's, not even mine. l'm just a trustee. You mean, l should leave my own house? This is my house. My father's house. l'm Danish Yuvvraj Singh! Accept the truth, Danny. Drink? lsn't it funny, Sukamna, that l have to hear this from you? Cheers! That's absolute injustice! lt's unfair. Even l'm his son, uncle Mirza. l've millions of rupees in dues. l'm at the wrong end of the gun! Do you want me to end up in the streets! You'll have to do something, uncle Mirza. You have to help me out. Danny, hi. How are you? This is my new boyfriend, Mr. Douglas. Actually, he's the second richest man in town, aren't you, darling? So, it's all over. All over! Listen Danny, l always told you that l only like men who have.. ..money, power and style. Sorry, l had to move on. C'mon, darling. Let's go. Hey! Stop! Stop! Please give me a lift. Come back here, please! Please, come back. Please don't leave me here! Come back! What have l done?! "There's the morning mist, the dust rising up in the evening." "There's loneliness." "The night is cold, there's pain, there's grief." "How do l pass this time, my breath is heavy." "The nights are sad and suppressed." "My eyes seem to have waited for ages." "Lonely.. l'm lonely." 'A man without relationships.. ..is like a man without a shadow.' 'Man is bound by the strings of the heart.' 'Man is bound by the strings of the heart.' 'Life is a long journey. lt can't be spent alone.' 'Unless there's light above, there's no shadow below.' 'There's no shadow below.' 'Let this heart reach out,..' ..let this bond strengthen. Damn. You got scared of this? - So did you.. Partner.. - No, brothers. Brother? - Brothers! Sure? - Sure! Why? - Because partners share a bond of gains and losses.. ..but brotherhood is a God given bond. You're mouthing Dad's dialogues! But l've understood it only now. A little late probably. We were such rogues, weren't we? Everybody, from around the world, shall come to watch our show. Anushka and Maureen's show. Guess who's the main singer? You! - How do you know that? Because you're the best singer. Will you please come for the show, Bala? But our evil uncle won't let me come. Tell that evil uncle that l've called you l've called you! Gyanesh will sing in front of the world for the first time.. ..and we'll be amiss! The situation isn't so. Thank you, Bala. You've led us to a new path. Johnny will bring Daniel's car to the airport. Yes, there's an important conference and l'll be going.. ..to Austria for that. Ok. You attend your conference while l attend Anushka's show. No, no. Anushka's crazy boy will be there and.. ..he'll lose his cool on seeing you. He'll wreak havoc during the show. Come. - You mean to say that l should stay away until then? You're a dignified man! l still remember that ghost is after my daughter .. ..since the past five years. That fool doesn't know that Sikander Mirza is my lawyer. l keep a track of all his daily activities. Hello! - Danny? - Uncle! There's no news from any of you! Uncle, actually Gyanesh has a very important show tomorrow. That's why! How can we miss Gyanesh's concert? No. Please, you're welcome. Welcome? We're already here - Oh God! Why are you remembering God, dear? No, uncle. Thank God. Thank God that you're here. We're coming. We're coming right there! Do you remember the lyrics? Have you written these lyrics? - Well, yes. They're very good. You look very happy today. - l look so, isn't it? Why shouldn't l be? Nobody even used to sit with me in that palatial house. Who brought me out of that place? Deven! Who gave me confidence that l can freely talk and sing? Anushka! She told me that l'm something. l am something! l'm not useless. Anushka is just, just.. What happened? You're very emotional today Don't you get emotional? Of course l do, that's why l pen it down in my songs. For me and for all of you. Will you pen down my emotions? Will you? Nandita! She's calling you. Come quickly and rehearse with the chorus singers. Coming. Daddy, this is not fair. You should've been here. Today, it's my biggest show ever. And being in the same town, you're not coming here. l'm very sorry but l seriously cannot come. The city mayor's surgery is due in half an hour. And l've been called here especially for that purpose. l'm sorry, darling. - Daddy, please come. No, no! - For me. Today is the last day of that monkey's contract. Tomorrow, our show begins and his show ends. Anyway, you don't worry. Alright? You give a great show! Bye! A lot of attempts, a lot of patience, a lot of tests. l've survived through all. But now, poison shall get rid of poison. lf everybody want to give their children everything. Then why shouldn't l do something for my children? This poison shall kill Gyanesh and.. ..his brothers will be blamed for it. That's it! Now you're looking fine. All the best! - Thank you! Bala! l was thinking about you. Such a big show, the entire world watching.. l'm singing, Bala. Me! Me! Good, isn't it? Good! Everything has fallen into place. l and Danny. Deven and Anushka. The entire family has come together. O God! Now even you're here. You're here! Not just me, all are here. All of them! Scene! What a scene! l appreciate you, brother Gyanesh. l've captured this joyous moment of yours in my camera. Let me see. - No! l capture everybody's moments in my camera. But l never show it. Why? - Why! Because these are private moments, brother. And they can even reveal secrets. Meaning? - Meaning. Bala! You're so innocent, brother. You left us and fell into the trap of those two tricksters. That is only for your property, brother. Who wish to destroy you, brother. They're even willing to kill you. lf you're talking about Danny and Deven, then just leave. Leave? Ok, l will. But just remember, brother. Faces never change in front of a mirror. You're about to perform a show on stage, wearing masks. But this is a reality show, brother. You want to see the real faces of your brothers? Then see this, brother! See this. Then see this! See this carefully. Then you might understand what l'm trying to tell you. See it, brother. See it carefully. You cheat! You fraud! You want to take away all the money? You want to portray me as the villain by calling him 'brother.' You have to handle Gyanesh not with hot temper,.. ..but with a very cool mind. Keep watching, brother Gyanesh. Keep watching. Bala!
