-Would you like a glass of port, sir? -Oh! Well, that's a nice idea. Thank you very much. That's very civil of you. What's your name again? -Wilkins, sir. -Wilkins? Here we are, George. Glass of port. That's right. Very kind of you. [CHUCKLES] Thank you, George, thank you. No, no, no, no, don't take it away. Leave it there. Leave it down. -On my bill, of course. -Oh, even the port isn't as good as it used to be. 100 pounds, did you say? You know, my boy, I remember watching a match here at this very table, same room, for 500. 500 guineas, of course. Not pounds, guineas. -Yes, sir. Of course. OLD MAN: As a matter of fact, it started with a fellow called Allan-- oh, what was his name? Allan Quatermain. -Was he playing billiards as well, sir? -No, no, no, he wasn't playing billiards. Allan Quatermain was in Africa. [BIRDS SQUAWKING] -Go downwind, now. [LOW GROWL] [MAN SCREAMS] [SCREECH] [GUNSHOT] [MUSIC PLAYING] ALLAN QUATERMAIN: Sir Henry Curtis, please. He's expecting me. ATTENDANT: You'll find him in the billiard room, sir. -Yes, of course. [CLOCK CHIMING] -Blast! -Hard luck, old fellow. You know, Goody, sometimes I'm-- I'm ashamed of you. Sometimes I'm ashamed of myself, dear fellow. Terribly hard luck, old man. How about you, Henry? Care to play? -No, no, no, no. -You still trying to beat him, Captain Good? -We've been in dry dock too long. Afraid to take to the water. -Allan Quatermain! -Good lord! [ALL GREET EACH OTHER] -As I live and breathe! Good to see you. -Well, c-c-come and have a drink. ALLAN QUATERMAIN: Have a look at this. -African gold, for sure. It's not African in design. -No? What else? -Well, the-- the shape, the, uh, the triangle. It, uh, well, it looks Phoenician. -It is Phoenician. I have it from the foremost authority in London. -Well, d-didn't Herodotus write that the-- that the Phoenicians sailed beyond the pillars of Hercules to sow corn in Africa and to reap it before their return? ALLAN QUATERMAIN: Yes. Go on. What else? -Well, theory has it that some of them stayed behind to, uh, well, to find-- to find the empire of King Solomon! W-w-where'd you get it. -Farthest south I've ever been. Here. -Well, is-- is that water? -Huge Lakes. An old missionary, McKenzie, was last there 20 years ago. He talked about lakes like oceans. -We shall need some of Peter's money. Yes, and a-- a-- a navigator. We shall, uh, we shall need a n-navigator. -Absolutely not. -Oh, come on, Goody, think of it-- Africa! -I am thinking. All that sun, indigestible food, all those animals? Absolutely not. -I-- I-- I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll play you, 100 up. If you win, you get 500 guineas. But if you lose, you come with us to Africa. ALLAN QUATERMAIN: Oh, Henry, you're much to good for the Captain. Why not give him a start. Say, what? 20 points of 100? -I don't need a start. I'll play it level, any time. Heads. -Off you go. -Ha-ha. [LOW GROWLS] -I'm devilish hungry. Can't we bivouac or something? I'd can soon run up something nice on the old stove if you can shoot something. SIR HENRY CURTIS: Ha-ha! I hope you can cook better than you can play billiards! CAPTAIN GOOD: Thank you very much. [TRUMPET] CAPTAIN GOOD: Out of the way, skippy. -The fellows gone native. Too many hours under the hot sun. Often happens, you know. SIR HENRY CURTIS: I ra-rather like this. CAPTAIN GOOD: Yeah, I rather like animals-- medium rare. -What are you doing? Making kipper? -No time for levity, dear boy. This is the important part. More salt? No, pepper. This is a very special goulash I picked up in Hungary, handed down from the Tartars. Spiced with a few good touched, oh, ho, good! Good, eh? [LAUGHS] -I didn't know the Hungarians had a navy. Oh, Allan. You know, I could really s-s-settle in this country. -I wouldn't. No, when this is over, I'd go back home and marry and English rose, if I were you. -Oh, no, no, no. English roses don't-- they don't excite me. No, I-- I-- I rather fancy a Diana. A goddess of the chase, and all that sort of thing. -Don't you believe it. He'll marry the debutante of the year. Never mind the goddess Diana. Probably in St. Paul's Cathedral. She'll be stinking rich. He has the luck of the devil. A soupcon more pepper. ALLAN QUATERMAIN: You know, you're very lucky to have all that in front of you. I'm afraid I missed it. -Ah! -Ah. -Ah. Well, it looks all right. -It is all right. Far better than that raw meat over there on the fire. This is Mazurka Venison a la Good. [LAUGHS] Trifle too much pepper? -I'm on-- I'm on-- I'm on-- CAPTAIN GOOD: Fire? [CHUCKLES] [LAUGHS HEARTILY] [EXHALES LOUDLY] ALLAN QUATERMAIN: Everything all right back there? CAPTAIN GOOD: Yes, thanks. There's dynamite in that wagon. Do the boys know that? SIR HENRY CURTIS: Well, if it goes off, w-w-we'll all know it. CAPTAIN GOOD: Charming. ALLAN QUATERMAIN: Come on, boy. [HORSE WHINNIES] Keep close together. Don't spread out. Keep away from that edge. -Aaaaahhh! [SHOUTING] [HORSE SCREAMS] [BOOM] [GUNFIRE] SIR HENRY CURTIS: Oh dear. [GUNSHOT] -Aaah! [GUNSHOT] -Aaaahhh! [GUNFIRE] -Aaaahhhh! -Don't worry, Goody, I'll get them back. Hold your fire. Come back here, scoundrels! Come back here at once! [SHOUTING] [GUNSHOT] -Aaaughh! [GROANS] -Aaah! [GUNFIRE] -Sir Henry Curtis. [SHOUTING] Umpslopogas! [GUNSHOT] -Aaahhh! [SCREAMS] Umpslopogas! Old friend, thank you. -Umpslopogas. [CHILDREN SINGING] -What-- wh-what's the form? -Oh! Just relax. Enjoy yourself. [SINGING AND DRUMMING] OK -Thank you. -You dance? -Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm too old for that. -Captain Good! CAPTAIN GOOD: Sorry. Afraid I don't know the steps. -Sir Henry? -Oh. W-w-well, why not? Do you mind? -Ha ha! -Stop eating that native mush, Quatermain. Try some of my Antelope Ragout a la Cordon Bleu. Very special, although I say it myself. -Oh, very well. [SINGS OFF-KEY] -A bit stringy, perhaps. -Stringy? -A little. Quite edible, though. -Edible? [SNIFFS] Mm. -It's hard to know w-w-where to look! -Heh. Ha-ha! Oh, uh, I-- I was just-- yes, well, uh, good evening. [MEN SINGING] -The mission. -Ah, uh, just in time for-- tea. [MEN SINGING] -Look, Mommy, horses! [MEN SINGING] -Come back at once, Flossie! [MEN SINGING] -Hello, my darling! Up you come. -Did you bring them? -Oh, dear, I clean forgot. -You didn't. Oh, you didn't. -[CHUCKLES] No, I didn't. -Oh, thank you, thank you. -It's Quatermain! -Hello, Donald! -Allan, good to see you again! -Ma'am. Follow me, gentlemen. SIR HENRY CURTIS: Souffle? By Jove! -Ah, I must say, ma'am, if you were French-born it couldn't have been better. -I hope you enjoy it. REVEREND MCKENZIE: I'm sorry, my wife's a little upset. -May I, Reverend? It could sag, if left. -Allan, we've lost seven more natives since you went. It's getting so they won't stay. -Leopard marks? REVEREND MCKENZIE: Aye. And we hear the drums most nights. -They would like cookies. -Hello, Lamb. -Thank you for your flower book. Look, this is mine. They're all from around here. -Oh! Hm, what's this one? -Oh, those. There are lots of those up on the mountain. -Really? Do you know, I've never seen one like that before? Not even in Kew Gardens. -If I sent one to Kew Gardens, would they name it after me? -Oh, yes. Do you know, they'd probably call it "Lilium flossius africanus." -Would they? [LAUGHTER] -Flossie, come along now. It's long past your bedtime. -I'll bring you a lily tomorrow. -Ah, God bless. -Good night. -Sleep well. REVEREND MCKENZIE: Good night, Flossie. Allan, the attacks have been worse since you left. -W-with respect, sir, your father would be away for weeks at a time? -Yeah, he's come back babbling, feverish, Bible in hand, gun empty. -Did he say anything of what he saw? -He said one day he'd never come back. That was 20 years ago. -And your wife? -Oh, she hates this place. We're leaving next month, forever. Excuse me, gentlemen. -Souffle, in the middle of Africa. -Hm. Not too bad. Trifle frothy for my taste. -All hands on deck. MAN: Early morning tea, monsieur? Sorry, no "Times." -Who the devil are you, may I ask? -Do you take sugar, monsieur? -One spoonful, actually. -OK, monsieur. Voila, monsieur. -You're the cook. -Hotel Crillon, Paris. Second entree chef Alphonse, trained under the great Escoffier, monsieur. -Oh, well, that explain the excellent souffle. -Merci beaucoup. What would you like for breakfast, monsieur? -What would I like? Ho-ho. Well, I'd like coffee, kidneys, toast, and marmalade, but oh-oh. -In 30 minutes. After your bath, monsieur. -Better than the army and navy. SIR HENRY CURTIS: Ah, Alphonse, uh, kidneys, please. Rare. Morning, Goody. CAPTAIN GOOD: Good morning. -Morning. Did he tell you where he worked? -The Hotel Crillon, Paris. That's the best hotel in the world. -Yes. And the Bastille. -Oh. -What? -What for? -Murder. -What? That fellow? -Well, what kind of murder? -Row over a woman. Crime passionnel, I believe they call it? -How disgusting. -What is it? -Flossie. She's missing. So is her pony. -Oh my god. ALLAN QUATERMAIN: Where do you think she might have gone? REVEREND MCKENZIE: Well, she has this passion for wildflowers. -Damn it, she's gone after that lily we talked about. -Did she say where? -Yes, up on the mountain. -But that's eight miles to the north. -I'll come with you. -Uh, no, uh, Henry. You and Good stay here, and keep a gun handy. McKenzie, do you have a gun? -No. I ride with the Lord. -(CALLING) Umpslopogas! [BEAST ROARING] [FLOSSIE SCREAMS] [ROAR] -Don't shoot! If you fire, you may kill the little one. [GUNSHOT] [GUNFIRE] [BEAST ROARING] -Umpslopogas! -You're St. George now, Umpslopogas. -Me no saint. And I catch the Leopard Man. You'll see. [DISTANT DRUMMING] -Madame! [SPEAKING FRENCH] -Help Umpslopogas! He's wounded. Isaac! -Flossie! Thank God. Oh, thank God! -I'm all right, Mommy. -Come into the house, Umpslopogas. -Can I whip you up something to eat? -I could do with a drink. -Monsieur Quatermain, maybe it is not a good time to speak to you. But I-- I want to go with you on your trek. -What, you? -Yes. -Well, why not, Allan? -Thank you. -We-- we-- we could-- we could do with a good cook. -What? -What do you say, Goody? -Well, he's a fair fancy cook. I prefer plain cooking, myself. -Well, let's put it to the vote. All those in favor, say aye. Aye. Say aye. -[CHUCKLES] Aye. -Then it's settled. -Aye. Heh, heh. [CHUCKLES] ALLAN QUATERMAIN: Give the horses a rest. Dismount! -Uh, if I ever put my hand on this treasure, I go straight back to France. -Eh? -Uh, I-- I buy my pardon. -Oh. -And I open the biggest restaurant in Paris. [BOTH LAUGH] -And you, Capitaine, what will you do? -Oh, I've always fancied a fine ship. White sails, black hull, three-masted schooner. I've always fancied that. -Yes. And you, Sir Quatermain, what will you do with the treasure? ALLAN QUATERMAIN: Oh, heh. Well, I suppose I could do with one of those new elephant guns. -Ah, come on, sir. Truly, why do you do all this? -Oh, I don't know. To see what's on the other side of a hill. -Huh? -I suppose. -And you, Sir Henry, what about you? What do you want? -Well, uh, um-- well, uh, nothing, really. -Hm! First, uh, caviar with vodka. And then a steak Wellington, eh? Uh, no. No, no. Carre d'agneau. Pas d'agneau. Uh, carre de warthog. [LAUGHTER] -Yes, monsieur. SIR HENRY CURTIS: Monsieur Alphonse, what about the w-wine? ALPHONSE: Well, monsieur, we will start with a Chablis. And then a 1837. -'37? No, no, no, no. I-- I-- I prefer the '42 myself. -Ah, monsieur, tres bien. We will have a '42. ALLAN QUATERMAIN: (SHOUTING) All right, let's call a halt. ALPHONSE: Just over here. Take the [INAUDIBLE] away. CAPTAIN GOOD: Cheer up, Alphonse, cheer up. Now what have we got for dinner tonight? Thank you. -When you tell me what I cook, uh, I will tell you then what you eat. SIR HENRY CURTIS: Oh, then I'll-- I'll-- I'll go and bag something for the pot. -Duck, pig, pheasant, anything like that. Don't go too far, Henry. Now what have we got here? Where were you? -Monsieur, you bring wine? -One has to preserve certain standards. -Oh, do we drink it now, monsieur? -No, we do not drink it now. We wait until dinner. I'm just merely opening it up to allow it to breathe. Mm. Now, where? [HUMMING] Ah. Alphonse! Don't just use anything in the stove. -What? -It's a delicate instrument. -Oh, says Anglais. [HOOTING] [GULPING] -Monsieur. Look. [GULPING] [HOOTING] [GULPING] -Oh, no! [HOOTING] [BELCHES] [LOW GRUNTING] -Quicksand. Oh, dear. Isaac? [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Quatermain. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]! -Needs a touch more pepper. -Monsieur, French cuisine, one chef. [QUICKSAND BUBBLING] -(SHOUTING) Allan! Allan! Goody! -[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [GUNSHOT] -Ah. Always lucky. [CHUCKLES] -Peter is coming. [LOW GROWL] [GUNSHOT] --[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Quatermain! [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Quatermain! [BEAST GROWLS] -Oh! -He's fast. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]! (SHOUTING) Curtis, where are you? [QUICKSAND BUBBLING] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [BEAST GROWLS] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [BEAST ROARS] [GUNSHOT] [BEAST ROARS] -Thanks very much. It was jolly decent of you. Thanks very much. [THUNDER ROLLS] Here's where we take to water, Captain Good. -Oh, ho! Just what I need. Tall ship, planks under me feet. [CHUCKLES] [THUNDER ROLLS] Them? -Afraid so. -The secret is in the whipping. Very fast, very light. Et voila. Understand? ALLAN QUATERMAIN: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] -No. -Well, he-- he definitely knows it. -Yes, he's obviously seen it before. But they deny that it means anything to them. -What's the trouble? -He's willing to barter his boats for our horses, provided we leave at once. -Oh, good idea. -Vous parlez pas francais? Parlez pas francais. CAPTAIN GOOD: Isaac? All right. Three in the first boat. -[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] CAPTAIN GOOD: Umpslopogas and the bearers, Alphonse, and his stove in the second. Got that? Chop, chop. -Now you look. In French, it is called a souffle. I don't know what it is called in English. -[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] -Hein? -[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] -[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] -[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] -What does he say? -He wants the stove. -Never! -I'll tell you what. Let him keep the souffle. We haven't time to eat it. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] -What did you tell him? -He thinks it's magic. He can have his dreams come true. -Uh-huh. -Get in the boat. No, no, don't turn your back. Keep smiling. -[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] ALPHONSE: What will he think when he discovers it isn't magic and all his dreams don't come true, huh? What will he say? What-- what will happen when we come back? -Who says we're coming back? -Heh, heh-- huh? -[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] -Monsieur? When do we stop for lunch? SIR HENRY CURTIS: Be careful, Alphonse, or you may find yourself on the m-m-menu. [LAUGHTER] -Hmf. Hmf! [GROWLING] -How do we get up the damn thing? That's the point. -Over to you, Captain. -Thank you, dear boy. [SHOUTING AND GRUNTING WITH EFFORT] [STRANGE BEASTLY NOISE] [SHOUTING] -Hey! Stay here! Hey! -Aaaahhh! ALPHONSE: Ooh, help! -Hang on, Alphonse! We don't want to lose the stove! [BEAST ROARS] ALLAN QUATERMAIN: Curtis, you're the clever fellow. What in god's name is it? -Well, lucky for us, it's a vegetarian. -Angels defend us! A ruddy sea serpent! -It's a sauropod of some kind. Like a brontosaurus or a diplodocus. They evolved at the end of the Triassic period. That's over 100 million years ago. -Somewhat before my time. -How do you like it, sir? Boiled, grilled, or marinated? -Working. -I say, jolly well done. -All right down here! Start her up! -Er, how do you get it m-m-moving? -Well, try shouting at it. -Oh. Tally ho! [BEAST BELLOWS] [THREE GUNSHOTS] ALLAN QUATERMAIN: Move, you stupid beast! [BEAST BELLOWS] [GUNSHOT] -A moment. There's an old schoolboy trick. [LOUD WHISTLE] [BEAST BELLOWS] [LOUD WHISTLE] [BEAST BELLOWS] [LOUD WHISTLE] -Th-the mating call of the sauropod. [LAUGHTER] [LOUD WHISTLE] -Keep it going. Keep it going! [LOUD WHISTLE] [BEAST BELLOWS] -Care to try it? [LAUGHTER] CAPTAIN GOOD: I think we'll pull in for the night, gentlemen. -I'll soon have some hot soup for you, messieurs. -Sorry, Alphonse. No fires. -Oh. Vichyssoise then, messieurs. -(SHOUTING) Quatermain! [WHEEZING] ALLAN QUATERMAIN: Henry! Good! [BEAST ROARING] -Get in the other canoe, quick! [GUNFIRE] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] -Oh! [CRIES OUT] CAPTAIN GOOD: Push the boat out, Alphonse! -Here. Put that between your teeth, Henry. These have to come out. [CRIES OUT] -How is the dear fellow? -Oh, he'll live. I'll tell you, he's born lucky. SIR HENRY CURTIS: If you call being m-m-maimed by a giant crustacean l-l-lucky. -You're all right. That poor crab lost his leg. -Yeah, well, he can always grow another. -Can he really? -Yes. You see, crustacea are c-c-cannibals. ALLAN QUATERMAIN: Captain Good, what do you think is out there? -If I knew where we were, I might be able to help you. [ANIMAL SOUNDS ECHO ALL AROUND] UMPSLOPOGAS: Captain. Captain, look! -I wish to speak to your captain. We thank you for your help. -Try and see if you can get him to tell us where we are. -You are in the kingdom of Zu-Vendis. -You speak English? How do you know our language? -Your missionary, McKenzie, taught me. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] -Well, Goody, you ever seen anything like this? -I've seen some old tubs in me time. It isn't Roman. It isn't Greek. Is it? -It's Phoenician, without a doubt. For 2,000 years, ships of this kind visited England. -We're in the lands of the devils. -Now, gentlemen, behold Milosis, the Forbidden City. [RUMBLING] -I realize I'm a stranger here, but I'd say that thing's going to blow its head off! -A moat of snakes around the front of our city. ALPHONSE: I wish I had gone to the Devil's Island, monsieur. ALLAN QUATERMAIN: And with the mountains in back, you certainly protect yourselves, Captain. -If we had not protected ourselves over thousands of years, there would be no Milosis to please you now. [SNAKES HISSING] CAPTAIN GOOD: I wonder if they dress for dinner here. -What on Earth? -That's not all. -Well done, Goody. Say, this one's a beauty. Let's hope we don't have need of it. I think we're about to find out. -Gentlemen. When you are ready, you will please come with me. -Excuse me, Henry. -Hm? Hm. [CHATTER] [FANFARE PLAYS] STETOPATRIS: Nypeptha, Queen Ruler of Zu-Vendis, Empress of all Phoenicia. -You, sir. Pray present yourself. -Sir Henry Curtis, ma'am. at your service. May I present Allan Quatermain, famous white hunter, Captain Good, Royal Navy, Umpslopogas, and our friend, Alphonse, magician of the culinary arts. -You've met Stetopatris, captain of the guard. And this is Matawani, high priest of Zu-Vendis. -The priests of Zu-Vendis have always protected the city. We have killed the strangers far from our land. [CHATTER] -We come in peace. You say you have learned to kill innocents with your leopard men, to frighten off any others who might come here? -Yes. -What are you hiding here that's so important to you? --[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] They are strangers! They must die! [CROWD MURMURS] -Enough. No more, I command you. [DOOR SLAMS] -You hurt your leg? -Uh, it's, uh, m-mending, thank you, ma'am. [FANFARE PLAYS] -Not an English rose anyway, Henry. -I'd hope not. -Not quite Camembert. -No. [CLEARS THROAT] But, uh, an excellent substitute. --[CHUCKLES] And the sauce on the duck. Was it duck? -Did you dine well? -Excellent, thank you. -Thank you, ma'am. -That's good. I'm sure you gentlemen wish to rest. And you, Sir Henry? -At your service, ma'am. -I would like to talk to you. -Fellow has the devil's own luck. Mind you, I'd settle for the handmaiden. Excuse me. I didn't quite catch your name. -I am Neva. -I'm Good. I mean, heh, my name is, uh-- -You are good man? -Yes, that's right. -Oh. -Well, no, that's not exactly what I meant. -Um, goodbye, good and holy man. -No. No, I didn't mean that. It's not quite what I-- Guess it's a language problem. Happened in Singapore once. It happens all over. -You have a very fine city. -Thank you. Our forefathers built the city many centuries ago. We have all but forgotten where they came from. -Well, the Phoenicians were great sailors, great merchants and adventurers. -When they came, they stayed. But a terrible plague killed most of us. We had to bring local people into our society on equal terms, or perish. -I see. And you and Stetopatris-- -We're the only two left of the royal line, and we are half-brother and sister. -I see. -After us, the royal line dies. -Ahhh. Matawani, the high priest, demands that I marry soon-- to Stetopatris, if need be. -Well, that, uh, that would be, uh, unwise. -Yes, I believe so. -I'm sorry. -Will you pour some wine? -Oh, but of course. I must compliment you on your command of English idiom. -The old man, the missionary, McKenzie, he taught me. He was my friend. Matuwani had him killed. Poisoned. -[GULP] Really? -Are you of royal blood in your own country? -Well, hardly. Heh. I am what is called an English gentleman. -You have a palace? -(STAMMERING) W-well, it's called a hall, actually. It's in Yorkshire. -How many slaves are there? -W-w-we call them servants. -Very well. How many of these, uh, servants? -Well, there's a butler. We have a butler. He's in charge of the house servants. Then, of course, there are the maids. -Slave girls? -No. No, no. No, no, no. -How many? -Slave-- er, maids? Well, I don't know. Um, uh, there's the upstairs, the downstairs, the kitchen-- all told, well, I suppose there must be a couple of dozen. Rather a lot. -You have a queen in your country, I think. The old man said this. -Uh, yes, we do, a very fine queen. God bless her. -Do you know her? -Well, I have met her, yes. I know Tum-Tum best. -Tum-Tum? -Yes, that's, uh, Prince Edward, her son. -I think you are very-- what is the word? Modest. -Oh, I don't know about that. -I also think you're a very interesting man. -Oh, well, thank you. I must say, you do a-ask an awful lot of questions. -There is one I would like to ask, but not here. -N-no? -Do you have many wives at home in England? -Good lord, no. I'm not much attracted to, uh, English roses, you see. -Do you not like women at all, Sir Henry? -My dear lady! Of course I do. Quite a bit, actually, uh, on balance, as it were. In the right time and place, of course. -And is, uh, this the right time and, uh, place? -I say. I say! -What? What is it? Is there something wrong? -I wanted to see you. -See me? -But I'm not here to [INAUDIBLE]. -Oh. -I said I had another question to ask you, and it is this? Why did you brave the dangers of the waterfall, the animals that live in the mountains? To seek in our city? Why are you here? -Well, it's, uh, it's very complicated, actually. -Do you wish to conquer us? -Good lord, no. -To make us slaves for your queen? -Oh, certainly not. It's more like curiosity. -Not greed? -Well, I admit a man's soul can be stirred by a treasure hunt. -When gold outweighs the soul, destruction is inevitable. -Gold? -The last centuries have been happy ones for the people of Zu-Vendis. We have abolished gold, and therefore we have abolished greed. -Right. But i-i-is that possible? -Yes. You see, after King Solomon took over this nation as a storehouse for his wealth, we fought many civil wars amongst ourselves. So a great peace had to be established. The treasure was buried without trace. The priests did this in order that no man would ever be tempted to gain possession of it or kill for it. It is lost forever. Matawani wants to find the treasure. He will reward the priests. They will become greedy. He will kill them, or they will kill him. It will all start again, the killing. -H-h-how can I help? -Here's a map. Find the treasure. -What? -Find it and go. -You're not serious? -Tell me I can trust you. -My love, my Diana. [THUNDER ROLLS] -If you had stayed, I would have made you my consort. Good night, Sir Henry. -Consort? Consort be damned. [THUNDER ROLLS] -The man who designed this map was a cartographic charlatan. SIR HENRY CURTIS: Yes, well, it would help if I could remember my Phoenician b-better. But there seems to be a reference here to the sun and the meridian. -Hopeless, dear boy. It's an enigma inside a riddle. Or is it the other way around? -Well, short of tearing down the whole temple, what do we do? -Well, the treasure was never meant to be found. We can't expect it to be easy. Here, let me see. [BOOM] -Please. Please hurry. Please. You must. Neva. -Oh, monsieur, the people, they are leaving the city. -I don't blame them. -We leave too, monsieur, n'est-ce pas? Aren't we? -What do you suppose the significance of that is? -What-- what difference would it make, monsieur? Everything will fall around us. -What is it? Are you on to something? -Damned if I know, but that stone in the center there and three obelisks have to mean something. -Rutui. -Neva, brush my hair, please. [BOOM] -Rutui was one of the gods worshiped by-- by King Solomon. The god with one eye. Uh, here, here, on the map. It's-- the sun is at its zenith! -For your information, in two minutes, it'll be noon. -That's it! -What is? SIR HENRY CURTIS: The obelisks are only a part of it. -Exactly midday. -The obelisks. The obelisks are a ruse. -[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] -It's that m-m-medallion! -Anybody got a shovel? -I know the queen's wishes. I bring men to help you carry away the treasure. [BOOM] [GASP] -[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] -Come, Neva. Come! [SCREAMS] [MAN SCREAMS] -Well, gentlemen, there it is. King Solomon's treasure. -(SHOUTING) The priests! They have taken the queen! -[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [GASP] [SCREAMS] -Easy! MATAWANI: Stetopatris, take your men and go. ALLAN QUATERMAIN: (QUIETLY) Do as he says, or he'll kill her now. Wait for us outside the city. -[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [BOOM] [SCREAMS] [GUNSHOT] [PANICKED SHOUTING] [GUNFIRE] [SCREAMING] [GUNFIRE] -Aaaauughhh! [RUMBLING] [SCREAMING] -Aaaagghhh! -Aaaahhhh! [GUNFIRE] [CLANG] [GUNFIRE] [SCREAMING] [GUNSHOT] -Aaaahhhh! [GUNSHOT] Auuuuugghhhh! [GUNSHOT] [SCREAMS] [GUNSHOT] [SCREAMS] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [SCREAMING] [HISSING] [HISSING] -Aaaauuughhhh! [GUNSHOT] [SCREAMING] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] -Auuuughhhh! -Well done, Umpslopogas. Umpslopogas! -You must go. -Nonsense. You're coming with me. -Not this time. This time, I must make my journey alone. -You can't! -I have spoken. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] -Then go on your journey in peace, my friend. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [BOOMING AND RUMBLING] [SCREAMING] -Oh, Stetopatris! SIR HENRY CURTIS: Umpslopogas, where is he? -Let's go now. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] -What are you saying to them? -They must stay here, for the queen will be back. [BOOM] [SCREAMING] -[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] -You're going to stay? -Of course. Stetopatris will kill the few remaining priests, and then we will rebuild our city. [BOOM] Look for the last time. -Look out! [GUNSHOT] [SCREAMS] -The mountain provides and the mountain takes away. Do not grieve for me, Sir Henry. Find an English rose. -There is the pass to the other side of the mountain. It's the route the leopard men used to take. -Are you sure you wouldn't be better off coming with us? -I am king now. -Monsieur, I think I want to stay, too. -My dear fellow! It won't be easy, Alphonse. -Well, it's will not be worse than the Devil's Island, monsieur. -Ah. -And besides, how can they build up a civilization if they-- if they don't know how to cook? [LAUGHTER] -Well, goodbye, Alphonse. -Au revoir, monsieur. -Good luck, Alphonse. -Goodbye, Monsieur Quatermain. And don't forget, sir! Patience when you are whipping up the souffle. Light and frothy, et voila! And, uh, not too much pepper, monsieur. -Ha-ha! -Au revoir, monsieur. -Hey, not a bad fellow. Could have been English. You think anyone's going to believe any of this back at the club? Of course, no one in the club believed a damn word of the story. But he was a decent fellow, Quatermain, a decent fellow. Do you know what he did? He left this, uh, medallion, I think they call it? Left it to the club for the oldest member to have the privilege of wearing it. Perhaps you'll find yourself wearing it one of these days. [MEN SPEAKING OF BETS] -Manners. Bloody club's going to the dogs. [MUSIC PLAYING]
