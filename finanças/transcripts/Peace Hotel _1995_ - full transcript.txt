No! No! No, it's not my business! Don't kill me! Let me go! It was said that ten years ago... a big and notorious troop of mounted bandits... were killed by a guy who was as terrible as Death. No one could escape. No one knows who this guy was. Or where he came from. No one knows his name either. So, the people named him... The Killer. What happened that night? Why did he kill so many people? No one knows the truth. But we all believe it must have been related to a woman. After that night... he marked the boundary by stabbing a sword into the ground. He opened a hotel called the Peace Hotel. In the following ten years, this hotel let many people... who were utterly helpless take refuge. At that time, there was an understanding among the people... that no matter what a person did... or who they offended... if they could reach the Peace Hotel alive... their foes could not pass the sword and enter the hotel. No one could harm that person. And the Peace Hotel would never meddle in their affairs. They won't support anyone. They won't help anyone to leave. During these ten years, no one dared to create trouble at Peace Hotel. And Peace Hotel never broke its rule to send anyone out. Until the arrival of this woman. Please give me a deluxe room. I want a hot water bath. Once ready, I'll be at the restaurant. Please give me a glass of wine. And if there is any expensive food, just bring me some. You have no money! How dare you cheat us with this fake stuff? Right! Many nasty people are staying at this hotel. How dare you swindle here? Do you want trouble? Why don't you show this ring to your boss first? Serve me some food at once. If I starve, you will be in trouble. Go and get it now! And you'd better tell him... I don't intend to have a reunion. Tell him to serve me a room. I will stay for only two nights. I won't see him again. I don't want him to care about my business. Do you know that our boss who you just mentioned... is the notorious Killer? Right! I don't know him as Killer. I just know that he's my husband. If I could choose again, I wish I'd never met this guy! Didn't I tell you guys? Boss must have had a lover. He established this hotel to wait for her to return. Boss! Boss! The woman you've waited ten years for is back! The man who bought my virginity... lied on me like a mountain. I cried. Then I heard those procurers and madams crying. They cried one after another. I knew it was him. He killed all the procurers and madams. Then he killed the man too and saved you? Rest in peace. Rest in peace. - A boy without trousers! - Return it to me! Here... When he reached the second floor, I was already raped by that man. What a shame! I'll never stop blaming him for the rest of my life. Why was he late? Come on, wear the trousers, don't catch a cold. - Come on. - No. - Please wear them. - No. I travelled with him from province to province. His foes kept chasing after us. He killed whoever came. Once he showed his sword, he would not let anyone live. Once he saw blood, he would not stop. Dare you do that again? - You are a big creep! - Yes, I am a creep. How dare you? I am sorry... please don't hit me so hard! - You are a big wolf! - Yes, I am... - Dare you do that again? - Please don't hit me so hard. - How dare you? - It's just for fun. - Dare you do that again? - Stop! Or I will be angry. Dare you do that again? The more he killed, the crazier he became. He killed those who deserved to be killed and those who didn't. He killed men and beasts too. He killed whatever moved in front of him! He couldn't forget seeing that man raping me. He vented his anger by killing. He became an insane killer because of me. Please stop crying. Was your bottom stabbed by the branches in the forest? Ten years ago, I was pregnant with his baby. I followed him to this courier station. I was going to deliver the baby. When I was delivering, I held his hand and said... I wish there could be a Peace Hotel. Once we get there... we wouldn't be afraid of our enemies' revenge. We wouldn't need to hide a gun under the pillow when sleeping. Don't cry, this is all my fault. Don't cry... He showed me the baby. That's the first time I saw our son. His little eyes were not opened yet. He was sucking his own little fists. Suddenly... Promise me, don't tell your mom about the trousers. All right? Promise me please. Come on, give me a kiss. Come on, give me a kiss. Come on, I am sorry. Come on, let me kiss you. He killed everyone in the courier station, but so what? He opened the Peace Hotel because of my words, but so what? He saved so many people's lives in these ten years, but so what? Our son was still the same... he would never return to life. Mistress, please give Boss a chance. He's totally different now. Yes, he's very nice to people now. We dare not leave the courier station. So he goes out to buy food himself. In these ten years, he's been lonely. He hasn't known another woman. - My son is his only playmate. - That's right. He regrets it very much. Why don't you give him a chance? Right, Mistress! Please give Boss a chance. - Stop! - Boss... I forgot to buy medicine for piles for your mom. She will start nagging again. We forgot to buy a bra for Auntie Skinny, she'll definitely complain again. Boss... Don't blame me... I have to buy so many things for you all... it's not surprising for me to forget one or two. Never mind... Someone will keep you warm at night again. - Boss, Mistress has returned! - Yeah...! Have you bought the things I need? - Where are the slippers I wanted? - Over here. Your letters! Thank you... I'm sorry to hide inside your room. Are you the Mistress our Boss has waited ten years for? What mistress? I'm a fake. All the people are nasty here. Aren't you worried your identity will be disclosed? No, my family will come here soon. Do you know my surname? It's Soong. Soong Tze-wen is my elder brother. Soong Ching-ling and Soong Mei-ling are my sisters. I've been here for ages, I don't know much about the outside world. How about Chiang Kai-shek and Sun Yat-sen? They are my brother-in-laws. They are financially supported by our family... to be the President and the Generalissimo. I just know Emperor Ping of the Soong Dynasty. And a guy named Soong who delivers food. Emperor Ping of the Soong Dynasty is my dad. The Soong who delivers food is my grandpa. You are the daughter of Emperor Soong? So you are a princess? Of course. So can you lend me some money to rent a room? When my family arrives, I will pay you back tenfold. How much do you want? As much as you can. If you lend me more, maybe I can let you become an official. No, thanks. Fine, I'll sleep with you then. Just pay me some money. Ten dollars an hour and twenty dollars a night. If you think I'm good, recommend some clients for me. I will give you commission. No way. The Boss of this hotel is very traditional. He won't let others hook and gamble here. Living here is like staying in a prison. He won't let anyone step out of the hotel. You'd better go after taking your bath. I'll leave you some coins. That's enough for you to rent a store room. Hey, why don't you negotiate? What a dummy! Pal, come on, cheers! Boss, don't kill me! Mistress. Music! Mistress...! You are so pretty! I'm not hungry now. Open a bottle of wine for me please. And bring me some snacks. Bring me more bottles of wine, I will take them to my room later. And bring me more cigarettes please. Have a seat, you must be tired. He's here... When I saw Mistress wearing your clothes... I knew you two had reconciled. That's right... I've said it before, for a woman... she will forget all hatred after making love. Shut up! Boss...! You still have so many followers while you are on the run... I can tell you are a big Boss. Have I seen you before? I came here after sunset. Why did you come here? I killed people. Miss, what about you? Me? I stole a piece of national treasure. If you want it, just offer a price. Look at this fountain pen, if you can take it out... and find a buyer, you will be rich! Let me show you. Open it like this. I've got a similar one upstairs. How can you compare yours with mine? This pen was used by Emperor Hsin-feng for signing the unfair treaty. Look at this lighter. It's opened like this. I have a similar one too. How can you compare yours with mine? Lin Tsi-hsui used this to burn the opium. This pocket watch is great too. What's so great about it? Have you ever heard of Emperor Ping of the Soong Dynasty? Sure... This was the favourite pocket watch of Emperor Ping. When he died, he wanted this to be buried with him. Let me show you. Don't pull so hard. It's opened like this. See! There's a picture of Emperor Ping! You swindled and then stole. You can have them back. And you want to rob too? Please mind your words. You can't insult me like this. Do you know who I am? The daughter of Emperor Ping. Dog, Witch. - Skinny, Fook, Sau. - Yes, coming... - Who am I? - Mistress! What's wrong, Boss? It's okay, let me help you. I'm going to get changed. Take everything to my room later. What are you doing? She's choking. Boss, Mistress is choking on the sour plum! Don't you ever touch my stuff! Return everything you have stolen from my room! My ring. What are you doing? Go behind the screen. How about sleeping with you for the rent? Where did you work, Seven Skies Nightclub or Paramont Nightclub? Paramont Nightclub. You are using the rouge of Fa Heung Hall. Wearing the cheongsam of Lo Kai Fook Tailor. But you wear such ugly shoes. I don't think you have been a hostess for long. Six months? No. Five months. Why did you come here? Gambling? Do you owe the loan shark money? They wanted me to pay with my body. I paid but they didn't admit it. I was very angry, so I took a pair of scissors... and stabbed the bottom of the loan shark. That's why he sent those people to kill me. But I know some thugs too. Maybe they can help me. Do you want more trouble? You want such people to help you? And then you want to repay them with your body too? Have a seat. Are you Cantonese? I saw many Cantonese snacks in your bag. Do you have any family? If you have a family, just go home. Don't stay here unless you really have nowhere to go. Tomorrow, there will be a train to the South passing by at 6:00 am. Leave by the front yard. I hope you'll get onto the train alive. Go and check into a room downstairs. Thank you. Take this for your funeral! The water is cold, don't you know to add hot water? Bring some ginseng tea for us. You're blind, you don't need to sleep, do you? Mistress, we can't take it anymore. Let's play again tonight. Yeah... I've lost a lot of money. How about we forget the money I owe you? No way... Then carry on with the game! Don't cry in front of me. Tell me! What did you do before coming to the Peace Hotel? I used a pair of scissors to stab the bottom of a small potato. Small potato? The small potato has some followers. Get out! You think they are coming for me? I'm not that great. Shau Siu-man, you killed our boss! Get out here at once! Who is Shau Siu-man? Who killed their boss? Confess now! The one in the red cheongsam. The one in red pyjamas! Oh, it's you! It's not me, it's none of my business. They are not here for you? Of course not. If I'm wrong, I'll be your servant! I confess! I stabbed the man who is lying on the cart. But I only stabbed his bottom twice. He could chase after me a long way after that. I don't know why he suddenly died. What are you doing? Drop your guns. Haven't you fought enough? Are you the Killer? The woman inside your hotel killed our boss. Hand her over at once. That woman stabbed him with a pair of scissors first. Then she took his gun and shot him seven times. She also stole thirty gold bars from our Grand Hall. I don't care whether she killed your boss or not... but since I opened the Peace Hotel... I don't wish anyone to create trouble at my place. If you respect the dead, take him away now. Bury him soon. Do you really think this rusty sword could forbid us... from claiming the woman and the gold? We are all killers. How many people have you killed? Our boss has killed as many as you did. But I'm different from you! Everyone saw me killing. If you don't hand me the woman and the gold... I will come and get her myself... and I would like to see whether you can kill all of us or not! If you want to create trouble over such a small matter, I have nothing to say. I can't rehearse killing in front of you. I have to ensure the safety of everyone staying in the Peace Hotel. If you want to get her by force, I'd be glad to play with you. If I can't kill that woman within twenty-one days... I will disperse my Grand Hall. When will you send me away? It's a piece of cake for me to kick you out. Search every place she's ever been. See whether she has hidden the gold of the Grand Hall or not. Yes! If I had the gold, I wouldn't be so helpless now. Mistress, it's your fault. Why did you mess with those men? In these ten years, I have been alone... Are you still pretending to be the Mistress? Isn't she the Mistress? Isn't she the woman you've waited ten years for? I haven't waited for any woman. If anyone pretends to be my woman again, just kick her out. You're not the Mistress? How about the money you borrowed? Return my money... If that woman comes out, just kill her. Get lost! Go and clean the floor. Clean the toilet later! Wash the bowls! Prepare the dinner! And make soup for us! Boss, why not just hand that woman over to them? Yeah... Good idea. If your foe comes tomorrow, I'll hand you over too. - I'm sorry. - I didn't mean it. Boss doesn't want to kick her out. He must have slept with her last night. No need to wait, let's eat. - Boss, tuck in. - Let's tuck in. This is what I can do. You'd better send me away, so you won't have so much trouble. - Hold her. - How dare you! Make her drink every drop of it! My husband and my children... are waiting for me at home. My husband has got lung disease. That's why I worked in the Paramont Nightclub. I miss my children so much. Return the picture to Skinny. I forgot to bring my family portrait with me. If you swear not to tell, then I will tell you a top secret. In fact, I'm not the only target of the Grand Hall. They just want this... confidential name list. Don't touch Doggie's exercise book again. I told you it's confidential! Why did you peep at it? Well done! She deserves it! You call yourself human? Don't you ever bother me again. Everyone comes to the Peace Hotel because they don't want to die. But I haven't seen one who is as afraid of death as you are! Since you've come here, you'd better repent. If you can escape this time... I hope you can learn to be a better human being. Don't waste your time and effort. No matter what tricks you play, I won't send you away. Go back to your room! I know how foolish I am. They've come here in order to pick on the Peace Hotel. I didn't kill or steal any gold. You think only stabbing him won't make him want to kill you? You know the truth. But you didn't apologise to me. And you act like a saint by letting me stay. But when you are angry, you just vent your anger on me. You said I lied, but in fact yours is the biggest lie! If you were innocent, you would never have come to the Peace Hotel. They don't believe you. If they break in, can you kill them all? Can you? If you could, you wouldn't be so troubled! You wouldn't let me wait for death here! The Killer opened the Peace Hotel, that's the biggest lie in the world! Do you want me to launch a massacre every now and then... to make you believe I'm the Killer? If you don't trust me, just go out and let them kill you! Hurry up... Bring me some wine. Wine! Stop! Go... Go! If anyone dares to kill in my hotel or around this courier station... I will kill without mercy. And I will kill the men who followed... as well as the man behind it! I will kill everyone in his gang too. Just like the massacre launched on that night ten years ago. Give way... Place the tables together. Come and help! Go and bring some medicine here. Put her on the table. You'd better go out. Go out, don't bother us. Go out first. Boss, she's dead. Boss, she's really dead. Go away. Wake up...! She's all right, she's awake. Wonderful! Those men are gone! Wonderful...! Let's go and take a look. Let's celebrate! Come on... Place your bets now. Don't you have to work? - Don't go overboard! - Yes, Boss. Come in. Boss, I've cooked some fish congee for Miss Siu-man. Do you have to take care of Doggie? - Yes... - Just leave it here. Thank you, Boss. Small has appeared five times in a row. I want to bet ten dollars on Big. Come on, bet now... - Bet ten dollars on Big for me. - All right. Three sixes, all lose. Well, we lose. Why didn't you scold me? I always ask those who come here to change their temper. But I haven't changed my bad temper. I have to learn how to be a better human being. Do you know how my dad taught his son? My dad was a warlord, he had four wives. When I was small... he always held my hand to shoot those he caught. I didn't know anything, but just thought it was funny. He told me, if I killed one or two... I would be a killer, I would be a nasty guy. But when I killed thousands of people... I would be a hero. A supreme hero. When I was twelve, he was defeated by others. His head was chopped off by another hero. I had nothing and had to run away. Once I went into a village, I was so hungry and I was sick. I stole a sweet potato from the field. Suddenly, a man tied my neck with a rope. I fell to the ground and was dragged away by him. Just before I got breathless, I grabbed some bamboo... and I stabbed him to death! Later, I was surrounded by six strong men. They beat me with farming tools. Finally, I killed them all. Do you know how the villagers treated the boy who killed seven adults? I stayed in that village for ten days. No one dared to bully me. They fed me and gave me anything I wanted. Before my departure... five or six boys who were older than me wanted to follow me. At that moment, I strongly believed that my dad's words were true. The following ten years... I always remembered his words. I built up my own gang. I killed numerous people. I became a notorious and horrible man. Until that night... Was the real mistress killed on that night? In fact, both of you are similar in many ways. You smoke, you drink and you love gambling. You are so bold too. But when she sang on stage... amazing! She was so charming! Come on, have some congee first. Come on. Is it delicious? Delicious? Old man, you want to leave? The killer shouldn't have saved that woman. If I were that man from the Grand Hall, I'd come back for revenge. - Big mouth! - Go to hell! I said Old Man would leave! You lose ten dollars. Stranger, you want to leave too? What's wrong with you? The Peace Hotel is not peaceful at all, that's why I have to leave. Did you inform the Boss? Why should we? We paid the rent! Let's go! Go to hell. Ask them to come back! Boss, they paid all the rent. The men from the Grand Hall haven't left! Go back in... Hubby, take care of our son! I was once lost and disappointed. Feeling puzzled and scared in the crowd. How can the lost one moor? When I find this love... I look forward to it. I regain hope because of you. Igniting a candle in the dark. You arouse my passion. I am free because of you. You change my destiny. Accompanying me who's in tears. The swing in the rain. Swinging just like my heart. Change my fate. Protect me from the snow. I am lost no more. I got into trouble in the past. I was wrong but you healed my pain. Because you are helping me. Nothing is impossible in my life. I sing this song in peace. Thanks for re-creating me. You change my destiny. Accompanying me who's in tears. The swing in the rain. Swinging just like my heart. Change my fate. Protect me from the snow. I am lost no more. I got into trouble in the past. I was wrong but you healed my pain. You are helping me. Nothing is impossible in my life. I sing this song in peace. Thanks for re-creating me. Thanks for loving me. Boss, why not dance with Miss Shau? Go and dance! Go... May I be excused? Dance... The men from the Grand Hall are here again! Boss, I'm scared! What are you afraid of? Most of the nasty people are living in this Peace Hotel. Music. Our lives were saved by the Peace Hotel. - Come on, let's dance. - Let's dance and drink! How dare they mess up our only shelter? If twelve come, I will kill a dozen. Let's dance. I'm sorry. This hotel made you become the scapegoat. I hope this hotel can save you. Do you have a wish? Will you miss me as you miss your old lover? Go after them! Great! Take her away. You needn't worry about us, we won't be scared. He'll go back to the Peace Hotel. Let's go. Go...! Jump onto whatever train you see, and never come back. If you send me away, what about you and the hotel? I won't go. Go! I don't want you to be beaten to death again. If you die, whatever I do will be useless. If you like me, let's run away together. Hold this. Beat him... Have you beaten me enough? I take it that Shau Siu-man killed your buddy. I haven't kept my promise, I sent her away. This is my fault. My hotel hasn't offended you. You just want face, right? Now, you've gained what you wanted. Forget it, all right? You are wrong! That woman did kill my buddy... and she stole my gold. But she isn't called Shau Siu-man. She is called Lam Ling. She is an actress. She is a hooker! She is my woman, Ting Moon's woman. She slept with all my buddies. It's a piece of cake for me to catch her. But I intentionally let her live. I sent her to the Peace Hotel. I just wanted her to flatter you. To make you break your promise and send her away. If you got the gold, you needn't return it to me. She deserves it. Ten years ago, your buddies risked their lives for you. Some of them betrayed you, but you killed everyone in your troop. Ten years later, you opened this hotel, and you try to protect those scums. Do you think you can face your buddies? Red cheongsam. Wine glass with a lipstick mark. You love her, you were right to send her away. If she couldn't trick you into sending her away... I would have killed her. You were my follower. You are the kid I let go that night. You did so much wrong that night. Since you killed your wife... and killed all your followers... you shouldn't have let a kid go. Even your wife allied with your buddies to set a trap to kill you! You should have been killed ten years ago! All of you listen! If you don't want to die, come out before sunset. Otherwise, I will launch a massacre in the Peace Hotel after sunset! Boss... Get the medicine...! I'm all right... You shouldn't have any medicine. He didn't fight back. That's why he was seriously hurt. Why didn't you fight back? Why are you dragging us down? Why did you send that woman away? They want to kill us all now! Skinny. You saved a woman, and you want to pay for it with our lives. You betrayed us for a woman! We have been following you for years, you haven't sent any of us away. Are you crazy? If not for Boss, if not for this hotel... all of you would have been killed ages ago! You charge us! We charge four dollars a day to provide accommodation and food... you expect us to guard your safety too? Shut up, blind man! Don't fight! Shut up! I know all of you are scared. If you listen to them and leave the hotel... I can't take care of your safety anymore. Trust me once more. If you stay in this hotel, we can overcome this ordeal. Fook, Sau. Follow me to get the guns. Fook, Sau, lock the door. Don't kill me... Skinny, you can't go out! You made a mistake and you want us to die with you? Don't go out! We've been like prisoners here with you for nine years. Do you want my family to die with you now? Dog, I beg you! You can't let Doggie go out, he will be killed. Who do you think you are? - Let's go. - Boss... Let go... Doggie! Buddies, please bless me. Boss, don't blame them. Those who come here are all afraid of death. If most of the people stayed... the three of us would've had the guts to stay too. I am sorry, Boss. You have trusted me for years. Why can't you trust me one more time? Either live or die... please let us choose for ourselves, Boss. Sorry, Boss... What a useless bunch! You promised not to kill us! Why do you want to kill us? Don't kill me! Go, run...! Run... Get lost! Thank you for your gold. Thank you for sending me to the Peace Hotel. Thank you for beating me to death. Now I know who the real heartless creep is. And who the real man is! I'm now going into the Peace Hotel. Beat me to death again if you like. Go! Doggie, run! Boss, please don't kill me! No! No! No! Wake up, please wake up! The Peace Hotel is no longer the same, because the Killer is gone. We who betrayed the hotel for our lives, have to go our own ways. Boss... That was the last time I saw Boss. After that, I hid with my parents in a little fishing port in the South. Two years later, our foes came for us. They killed my parents. I heard that other people such as the blind men... Fook, Sau and Skinny, all had similar endings. Later, I heard a lot of gossip about Boss. Someone said he saw Boss in Northeast China. Someone said, in a courier station in the North... Boss helped a young widow and her son in the hotel she operated. I hope one of these stories is true. Even though I did see my friend leaving us on that day.
