Couldn't be any worse, huh, roy? Helen? Oh, my god! We're cartoons. Boy, this is strange. Strange? I'm an animated rodent Wearing high-heeled running shoes. The word "strange" is somehow lacking. At least we're safe here. No one ever dies in cartoons, right? Ralph, I left some food out. I hope it doesn't attract any mice. Don't worry. That new device is guaranteed. No rodent stands a chance in there. Stay tuned. How can you even think of eating doughnuts At a time like this? Should I look for some oat bran? I'm starved. If you don't come down, I'm leaving. Where you going to go, your cartoon mother's house? I am warning you, roy. Roy? Wow! These things are as big as buicks. I'm gone. That's it. I said we're through, and we are through.

They should've zapped you two home by now. You heard me... Discharge mr. Knable. Roy? Roy! Oh! Oh! Dad! Dad! Where's your mother? My obligation is limited to those I have a contract with.
