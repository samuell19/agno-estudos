(dramatic music) (dramatic music) - Sharon don't, let go of me, no! (dramatic music) (people chatter) (dramatic piano music) (horn blows) (tires squeal) (horn blows) (dramatic music) - Ann, just get down! - Just get down, you don't have to do this. (tires squeal) - Ann, just get down! - Get down! Okay, over here, over here, hold on. Paul, it took you guys long enough! - We just got the message! Ann, Ann, what the hell are you doing? - You're scaring the hell out of us! - Do you have any idea what you're doing? - You're wasting your breath guys, come on! - There's no talking to her, we just have to do something. - Ann, Ann! (people chatter) - You guys are a bunch of babies! - Not me, sis, I'm not a baby. - No, not you, Jerry. (people chatter) - Come on. - Come on, Ann, don't do it. Come on, don't do it (people holler) Ann, no! (upbeat rock music) (people laugh) (Ann hollers) (people holler and laugh) - [Paul] Ann, you're crazy! - I told you she'd do it. - [Paul] All right, I'm next! - [Jerry] Come on, Chad, let's go! (Ann hollers) - Not that you Philistines deserve it but today we're going to hear some live music courtesy of Sharon McKay. Mendelssohn's Rondo Capriccioso. (beautiful piano music) (people chatter) - Now don't get me wrong, I'm not running to the mall to buy the CD or anything but back there you almost made me like Mendelssohn. - Thank you. - No, seriously I've been in this class all semester, I haven't heard anything half as good. I'm Jerry, Jerry Price. - Hi, Sharon. - How you doing? Oh, sorry if we scared you the other day. - Excuse me? - Me and my sister, see she kinda likes to take chances, you know? - Oh, no kidding. - Listen, we're throwing a party this Saturday, wanna come? - I don't even know you. - Here. Here, eight o'clock to whenever. - Studying? - Uh-huh, I've got a couple of tests this week. - It's Saturday night. - Oh, you look nice. - Hot date. One of us has to have a social life. Don't wait up for me. - Night, Mom. - Night. (upbeat rock music) (people chatter) - Nice seeing you. Ammad, I love you. (Ann laughs) You look fab. Linda, good to see you. Have you seen Paul anywhere? I can't find him. - Hey. - Great party. - Hey, thanks, have you guys seen Paul? - I saw him go upstairs awhile ago. - You did? - Hmm-mm. - Okay, bye. Hi guys. (Ann chuckles) ♪ No telling where I've been ♪ 'Cause I'm all out of given and I'm out of control ♪ (doorbell rings) ♪ Ooh it's now I break - Hi. - Hi. - Jerry invited me. - Oh, okay, well, I'm Chad. - Oh, Sharon. - Yeah, I'll go get Jerry for you right now. - Paul, these are our friends. - No, no, these are your friends and they don't give a damn if it's my birthday or not. Come here, come here. Let me ask you something. - Okay. - Don't you get tired of seeing the same faces, doing the same things? Look, I know that you've got some time and I know that you've got some money. (Ann giggles) So, why don't you let me take you to California. - Now why would I wanna do that, hmm? - Because you're crazy about me. - Oh, really? - Yeah. - I'm crazy about you. - Uh-huh. - How crazy am I? (Ann chuckles) Ooh. Oh, why Mr. Lear, we have guests. ♪ What I need I take - Hey, you made it. - Oh, yeah. - Great, let's get you a drink. - Oh, okay. - Is this your first party? (Sharon chuckles) - It feels like it. - Oh, don't like crowds huh? - No time, I'm usually either studying or practicing. - Right, there you go. - Thanks. So, your parents don't mind you having parties like this? - I don't know, ask a psychic, they're dead. - Oh, god, I'm sorry. - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, it was years ago, I don't even remember them. - My dad died in a plane crash when I was a baby. - Oh, small world, mine too, in their private jet. - My dad was in the Army. - Oh, war hero. - No, no, just an unlucky test pilot. - Oh, so I guess we're fellow orphans. - It's beautiful and this is like a fairytale. - Yeah, you know that guy Chad he lives here, he helps out around the place. He actually built that loft up above the garage. - Hmm-mm. - Him and his brother, he came up from San Diego and he put in this gazebo. Ann always wanted one so. - It's amazing. - Yeah, well, it better be it cost us a fortune. - You really do own this place. - Only half of it. Boo. - Oh, I'm so scared. - Hi, I'm Ann, Jerry's sister. - Hi. - This is Sharon, from the music appreciation class, remember? - Oh, the piano player, yeah, Jerry says you're incredible. - Oh, I'm okay. - Oh god, I hate false modesty. You ask somebody if they're good at something and they say, "Oh, I'm okay." While all the time they're thinking I am the greatest whatever in the whole world but they're just too full of themselves to admit it. Excuse me. - Actually, Jerry's right, I am incredible. I won the state competition three years in a row and next year I'm gonna be transferring to Julliard. - Really? Well, let's hear you play. (upbeat piano music) (Sharon chuckles) - Well, it was a pleasure corrupting you. (Sharon laughs) Thank you for the business. (Sharon laughs) - Well, hey, you know, all work and no play. - Listen, can I call you sometime or? - Sure. - Really? - Yeah. - Cool. - Goodnight. - Right on. Goodnight. - Goodnight. (slow music) Good morning. - Hi, where'd you go last night? - Oh, a party, just some kids from school. - Anyone I know? - How was your day? (doorbell rings) Oh, I'll get it. Hi. (horn blows) - Hey, come on, we're going to the lake. - I can't believe you guys are up already. - Up, now, we never went to sleep. Come on, let's go. - Well, I can't, I really have to practice. - What for, I thought you had Julliard nailed? - Oh, not exactly, I'm waiting for my acceptance letter actually. - Sharon, Sharon, Sharon, Sharon, did you lie to me? Oh my god, well, then you have to come with us to make up for being a bad, bad girl. - Okay, I'll be right out. - Okay. (upbeat music) (people holler) (indistinct) (people holler) (man moans) (people holler and laugh) (Ann screams) (Sharon and Ann chuckle) No, no, no, you're not getting me up there. - What, no it's not as dangerous as it looks. - Oh, I'd be scared to death. Besides I gotta protect these. - Yeah, how long you been playing? - Forever, it's all I ever wanted to do. - Really? Oh, you're lucky I still don't know what I wanna do. (Ann laughs) Not a clue. - Well, maybe you're the one who's lucky. - Yeah, how's that? - Well, you're not locked into something, everything and anything is a possibility. - Yeah, is that how you feel, locked in? - At times. - Jerry likes you, you know? - I like Jerry. - Yeah? - Hmm-mm. - Well, don't let him fool you, I mean, he comes off really cocky and sure of himself but he's not, he's actually really sensitive and he gets hurt easily and I don't like to see it when he gets hurt. - It sounds like a warning. - It is. Just kidding. (Sharon and Ann laughs) What Jerry sensitive, yeah right. (upbeat rock music) Hey guys! - You coming, Ann? - I'm going up. - Oh, okay. - Sharon, you coming? - No, no, no, no, no, no! Leave me out, I'm fine. (upbeat music) Be careful, oh god. (Sharon giggles) - [Ann] I really think you should try the skirt on. - No, no, you don't, really no. - No, just try it on. - No, no, no, no, oh my god, no. - Well, you know, it's an idea. - Wait, oh my gosh but look, how am I supposed to sit in this? - Just sit like this, just sit like this. - You'll figure it out, just. (Ann laughs) - Oh my no, you know what? - Oh, it's great, it's so sexy. - No, but it looks slutty. - Oh, no, honey, that's the whole point. - Duh. - You look great, you'll get every guy you want, I tell you. (upbeat rock music) (people laugh) - Hey! - Hey, help yourself. - Love your show. - Thanks man. - Hey, you guys were rocking. - Thank you. - What'd you think? - Oh, I liked it baby. (man laughs) - Let's get out of here, it's kind of crowded in here. - Oh, okay. (crowd chatters) - I can't stand that guy. - Nico, how come? - He's always sucking up to Ann. (Sharon chuckles) - You know any guys who don't? - Well, it's not just that, he wants her to invest in his band. - Mm. - Yeah. - Hey, did anybody ever tell you that those things will kill you? - Well, probably I'll be dead before they have a chance to. - Don't say that. - Why, it's true, it's my fate. Why should I live longer than my mom and dad, right? - Oh, I see what you're planning, to crash and burn. - Probably. Unless I find a damn good reason not to. - Jerry. - What? - I really like you and everything. - It's okay, it's okay, I can fill in the blanks. - I'm sorry. - No, no, there's no law that says you gotta fall in love with me, right? So. (crowd chatters) - Hey you, another late night? Mail's in. Go on open it or I will. - Oh my god. I'm in. - You're in. - I'm in! - You're in! - Oh, I'm going! - Yes. - I'm going to Julliard! - Yes! Okay, what does it say? (mower runs) - What's happening? - I'm just catching up on some reading. - I'd appreciate it if you'd ask me before hanging out at my place. - Actually this is my place, Chad, you just live here, remember? If you're looking for beers, I cleaned you out. - What's the matter, is there something I can help you with, Jerry? - Yeah, yeah, let's talk. - Okay, what do you wanna talk about? - Let's talk about love. (Ann and Paul chuckles) - What are we gonna do, huh? - I think you know what we're gonna do. Come on, Annie, you trying to get us killed? - Coward. - What the hell? (radio chatter) (dramatic music) - Is this Miss Price? - Yeah. - What's going on, what's the matter, what? - Miss Price, there was an accident tonight. - Where's Jerry? - Down at the train tracks. - No. - He was walking along the tracks, Ann, he was really drunk. - No. - The engineer tried to stop but. - No. - It was over really fast, Ann. - No, please. (Ann cries) - I'm sorry, okay, this is all my fault. Jerry, he was all messed up tonight, I should have hung with him. - What, what do you mean? - You know how he gets, he was feeling lousy and worthless, you know? - No, no, he was doing really well, Chad. He was doing really well. - I know he was but with Sharon and everything, you know? He was really upset that she turned him down. - Sharon. - Yes, he was into her and he and she wasn't, he unloaded on me about it tonight. He was drunk, Ann, he'd been drinking all day, I should have known he'd do, I should have gone with him or something! (radio chatter) (Ann cries) (dramatic piano music) (clock chimes) (ominous music) - Sharon, have you got a minute? - Oh, sure. - Great, I just wanted you to step in here for a second. - Okay. - [All] Surprise! (Sharon laughs) (eerie music) - In the sure and certain hope of the Resurrection to eternal life through our Lord, Jesus Christ, we commit the body of your child, Gerald the ground. The Lord bless him and keep him. The Lord make his face to shine upon him and be gracious unto him. The Lord lift up his countenance upon him and give him peace both now and ever more. Give us grace, we beseech you to entrust his soul to your never failing care and love. And bring us all to your heavenly kingdom, amen. (rain pours) - Ann, I- - I don't think she wants to talk to anybody right now. - Just tell her how sorry I am. - I will, I will tell her. - [Man] Here you go. - I've been thinking. - What about? - California. - What about it? - Maybe you're right, maybe we should move down there. - You're serious? - Yeah. Why not, I mean, it's just too hard for me right now, you know, to be in this house, you know, in this town and everything. - Yeah, yeah, sure, just say the word and we're out of here. (ominous music) - Yeah. - Yeah. - Okay, I'm just gonna take care of a few things first, okay? - Sure. Oh, no, that's crazy, because as I recall it, a 10 ton locomotive killed Jerry. - No, Sharon did. - Oh, right, right, it was the evil Sharon's fault and she wasn't even there. - She's still a murderer Paul. - Oh, absolutely and she deserves to be in jail. (dramatic music) - Look, you gonna help me or not? (eerie music) - You're serious? - Completely. (engine revs) (tires squeal) (tires squeal) - Sharon, I've missed you so much. I've just been really out of it lately, you know, I didn't wanna see anybody. - I called a bunch of times. - I know, I know, Chad told me. - I thought maybe you'd blame me for what happened. - What? Oh my god, no, Sharon, no. - I know Jerry had kind of a crush on me. - No, Sharon, Jerry had severe depression. He never really got over losing Mom and Dad. But Sharon, this has nothing to do with you. Jerry was drunk, he was crazy. You made him feel good about himself. - I hope so, I- - Hey, hey, just because Jerry's gone, I don't want us to stop being friends. - Oh, no I don't either. - Okay. (Sharon and Ann laugh) - Oh, that's so beautiful. - Thanks, Chad gave it to me. Ruby is Jerry's birthstone. - That's so sweet. (ominous music) - It won't work. - Why not? - Well, for starters, you'll never make it, you'll slam against the cliff and kill yourself. - No, I won't. There's a gouge in the face of that cliff 150 feet down. I'll measure the rope exactly and I'll swing right into it. - Okay, let's say you make that, how you gonna get around the fact that the cops won't have a body to toetag. - Every couple of years someone drowns in that river and their bodies never turn up. - Yeah, what if the rope breaks? - It won't? - What if the car won't start, Ann? - What if is for losers, Paul. - All right, fine, you wanna get rid of Sharon so bad, why don't we just push her over the cliff. - No, because I wanna see her suffer, locked in a cell somewhere. - Give it up, Ann, it won't work. - Tell me something, if I go ahead with this on my own, and it does work, will you tell anyone? - You mean like go to the cops? - Hmm-mm. - No. No. - Really? Then you might as well help me, hmm? (ominous music) - You're actually gonna go through with this aren't you? - Hmm-mm. (people chatter) Come on, it'll be fun. - I don't know, I really do have to practice. - Oh, Sharon, you've been practicing every day for like 16 years, I think you know what you're doing by now. - Well, you know, Horowitz practiced six hours a day right up until he died. - Yeah, well, then he was dead, so who cared? Sharon, this really means a lot to me. Ever since Jerry- - Oh, I know, I know. - I just want things to feel like normal again, you know and I think a trip like this might do that. Hey, we can go without you but it wouldn't be the same. - Of course, I'll go, I wouldn't miss it for anything. - Oh, yeah! (Ann laughs) (ominous music) (engine revs) (Ann laughs) - Nico's coming? - Yeah, Tracy and Evan bailed, they'd rather be alone. Guess what, I think Nico likes you. - I barely know him. - Oh, that could change. (Sharon chuckles) - Sharon, Sharon! - Have fun you guys! - Bye! - Oh, thanks Mom! - Thanks, we will. - Here I got this. - [Nico] I'll be your stewardess. - Hey. - Everybody (indistinct) And your cushion can be used as a flotation device. How are you? (Ann hollers) Hey, hey now. - Are you ready guys? Let's go, let's go, let's go! (dramatic music) Hey, Sharon. - Hi. - Trust me baby, trust me baby. Come on, I got a rope for you. - Oh my god, you guys are crazy. No don't, no, no, no, please! - I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding. (people laugh) - Normally, I'd go down with you guys, but I gotta walk her down the trail. - That's easy for you to say. - [Nico] Normally I'd be the first one down. I'll walk her down. - You've gotta be nuts. - Somebody's got to. - Okay, guys, whew! (Ann hollers) - Ann's really something, isn't she? - Yeah, fearless. (rock music) (Ann hollers) - [Paul] Ann, this isn't a race, slow down. - Bye. (Ann hollers) (people laugh) - Oh, I hope your brother doesn't get jealous. - Ah, he's my half-brother. - Oh. - Not a chance, Paul's god's gift to women or haven't you heard. - I guess I was out of the room for that newsflash. - Oh, yeah, it's pretty incredible, it's like they all fall for him, it's amazing. (Sharon laughs) - Actually, I'm the one who's jealous. - Why's that? - Well, Nico was supposed to be my date. - Oh. - Can you help me? - Yeah, sure. - I'm sorry. - No, no. (Ann hollers) They better be careful, this part of the river can get pretty dangerous. - You know a lot about this area don't you? - I do, I do, I love it up here, it's, well, it's one of the last quiet places that I know. - Ooh. - Oh, I'm sorry about that, is it okay? - No, no, no, no, it felt fine. - Oh, okay. - It felt great. - Okay. - So tell me, how come you don't have a girlfriend? - Well. - I mean, you're a nice guy and you're good-looking. - Come on, get out of here. - No, you are. - Thanks. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to embarrass you. - No, no, it's okay. - Well, don't tell me you've never been in love before. - Yeah! (Nico laughs) - Sure I've been in love. (Sharon laughs) - I do not. - Yes, you do, you do. - Like a pigeon? - Yeah, you're walking along a little narrow windowsill. - It's true, Sharon, you've been doing it all day. (people laugh) - Well, I'm sorry, it's a very narrow path. - Oh, yeah, it's a really narrow path, have to hold your feet wide. - So embarrassing. (dramatic music) - So, what about you, Nico? - You're supposed to toast it, not burn it. (people laugh) - What about you? - It's a violation of family tradition to climb mountains. - Ah, family tradition yeah right. - No, it's true, it's the 11th commandment in my family. Thou shalt not climb mountains. - Right, I'm sure you've never broken any commandments. (people laugh) - Don't let her bust your chops, Nico, there are plenty of climbers in this world but very few great guitarists. - Well, thank you, thank you very much. (Ann laughs) - And if you practice real hard, you may be one some day. (people laugh) - You know, Nico's not the only musician here. Sharon plays the piano. - Oh, right, classical stuff, right? - Classical, the romantics. - No, I'm strictly rock and roll. - Yeah, well, you know Sharon is going to Julliard next year. - Julliard. - Oh, cool. - Yeah, of course how she got in is a mystery to me. My guess is she slept with the head of admissions. (people laughs) - Yeah, right the head of admissions and the dean of the piano department. - Or maybe they just go for that kind of mechanical playing. (Ann laughs) (dramatic music) - Mechanical? - Yeah, or technically proficient, I guess but shallow, without feeling. The way you play, Sharon. - I thought you liked my playing. - Well, you're my friend, I have to be polite, don't I? (dramatic music) - Don't be polite, please tell me what you really think. - Okay, your playing sucks. - [Chad] Whoa, Ann, take it easy. - You're just jealous because I can do something that you can't. - Oh, yeah, oh, oh I'm really jealous, Sharon, I'm really jealous. - What I do takes hard work and discipline. You haven't the slightest idea what those words even mean. - Oh, Sharon, none of that seems to matter does it if you don't have any talent. - Are you speaking from experience. - The only talent you have Sharon is for getting people killed. - [Paul] Ann. - That's a really hateful thing to say. - I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. (dramatic music) What? She's gotta learn to take a little criticism, don't you think? - Oh, for god sakes, Ann, go find her and apologize. - Fine, fine. (dramatic music) - Great, just what we need in the middle of nowhere, a cat fight. (dramatic music) (Sharon cries) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) - Sharon! Don't push me, what are you doing! (climactic music) Sharon, don't, let go of me! (Ann screams) (suspenseful music) - Ann! - Sharon, what's the matter, what is it? What happened, we heard Ann scream. - So did I. - Ann! - Where is she? - I don't know. - No, but she shouted your name. - Ann! - Weren't you with her? - No. - I think I should climb down and take a look. - What are you saying, you think she fell? - I don't know, I don't know! - Oh no! - I'm gonna get my climbing gear, stay here. - [Nico] What happened, Sharon where is she? - I don't know. - Were you two fighting? - Stop it, Nico, she said she doesn't know anything. - Ann! - Ann! - All right, did you see her? Ann! - I should go, I'm the better climber. - No, no, just hold me steady. - You're upset, you're not thinking straight, okay, come on- - Okay, go Nico, help me out here. I'm going down, I'm going down. - [Nico] Somebody's got to, let him go down. - [Paul] Give me some slack, geeze, come on, let's go. - All right, you got it, steady. - Okay, okay, come on! - Easy Paul. - Paul, be careful. - All right, stay, stop! - You see her? - Paul! - Did you find anything? - Hold on! - Easy Paul! - Oh my god, it's so dark. - Do you see anything at all? Do you see her, do you see anything? - Nothing yet. - What's going on? - What was that? - Huh? Nothing, I just kicked a rock loose. - All right, I can't hold you much longer man. - Yeah, okay, come on, lift me up! (dramatic music) (men grunt) - What'd you find, what did you see? - Nothing, I didn't see anything. - Okay, what we have to do is we have to go down, we have to walk down see if she landed somewhere along the side of the walls. - What do you think happened to her? - What do you think happened to her? - Come on, we're wasting time, give me that. Come on. Annie! Look, we should split up, I'm gonna go that way, check the river bank. - Okay, there's a ranger station a few miles down river, I'm gonna go check that out. - And I'm gonna go back to camp, drive into town and call the cops. - Why don't just wait until- - No, we all know what happened here! All we're gonna find out here, if we find anything at all is a body. - No, I didn't do anything, I swear. - Just stay here in case she shows up or something. Annie! - Ann! (dramatic music) - Oh, Ann! - No, no, it's me. - Where have you been, why are you all wet? - I thought I saw something in the water but it turned out to be nothing. Did anybody come back yet? - No, what did they say at the ranger's station. - There's nobody there. Did you find anything, anything at all? - No, no, look, Sharon, I don't know what happened up there but it sounded to me like- (dramatic music) - Hey, got the police. (phone rings) (dramatic music) - Yeah, all right I'll be right down. (dramatic music) I'm Detective Baker, Miss McKay. I'm gonna ask you a few questions. - Okay. - Were you advised that you have the right to have an attorney? - I don't need an attorney. - You're waiving that right at this time. - Yes. - Okay. So, why don't you tell me what happened tonight. - I was on a camping trip up at Shannon Falls with my friend Ann and some other people. - What kind of a fight? - Ann made a couple comments about Sharon and her music. - And this made Sharon angry. - Oh yeah, she was really pissed. - Why do you think she said those things? - I don't know, see Ann enjoys confrontation, you know, she likes to stir up trouble. - Ann went to go find her to like apologize. - And did she? - I don't know, the next thing we knew Ann was screaming her head off. - When I got to the ledge she wasn't there. - [Detective] But she called out your name. - I know, I know, everybody heard. - [Detective] Why do you think she did that? - I have no idea. - Did they do that a lot, fight? - Yeah, yeah, I hung out with Ann most of yesterday and she told me some things. - What kind of things? - About how Sharon was jealous because Ann had money and she didn't. And there was that whole thing with Jerry. - Jerry was everything to Ann and it ripped her up when she died. - You think she blamed Sharon for what happened to Jerry? - Actually I think it was more the other way around. - What do you mean? - Well, I loved Ann, okay but she could be kind of controlling. And she didn't like Jerry having a girlfriend, so she made him break up with her. - And that's why he got drunk that night and wondered onto the tracks. - Yeah, that's the way Sharon saw it. - Well, Sharon said that she was jealous because Nico was supposed to be her date but I don't think that she was really jealous, I think that she was just saying that you know? - But she did say that she was. - Well, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what she said. - Maybe you were so angry tonight, angry about a lot of things you're not remembering what happened. - I remember exactly what happened. Look, I've already told you everything, if you think that I actually pushed Ann over that cliff than arrest me, otherwise, I wanna go home! - All right. Sharon McKay I'm placing you under arrest on suspicion of murder. - What? - Please be advised that you have the right to remain silent. - But I didn't do anything. - If you do choose to talk anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. - I'm innocent, I'm innocent! - You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. - I can't believe Ann is gone. - Me neither. (dramatic music) You bitch. You pulled it off. (dramatic music) (jail door slams) Come on, Ann, come on, pick up the damn phone. (phone rings) (dramatic music) - They haven't even found Ann's body. - Hey, a defense I will raise, right vigorously, bottom line they don't need a body. - That's ridiculous. - I agree but there's precedence in the case law and the DA knows it. Look, I admit that the evidence in this case is entirely circumstantial but I don't wanna risk taking it to a jury. - Okay, listen, I keep asking myself, why did Ann shout out my name like that? It was like she was trying to set me up or something. - There's sworn testimony from three witnesses that they heard a falling screams, so. - No, okay, all right, I mean, she went over the cliff, okay, I'm sure but maybe she wasn't pushed, I mean, maybe she jumped. - You mean she killed herself and pinned it on you. - It's possible. - Look, why would she do something like that? - I don't know because of her brother, Jerry. When he died she said she didn't blame me for it but deep down inside I always thought she did. - Sharon, come on, killing yourself to get back at somebody, that's pretty drastic. - Yeah, I know. - Hey that car there. - Yeah, what about it? - It looks familiar, I thought it might belong to a friend of mine. - Yeah, well, the rangers just hauled it in from the park, that's where your friend left it. Tell them to come and claim it, this isn't a parking lot. (dramatic music) - Sit right in there. Hmm-mm. - Hi. - Hi. - I brought you some flowers but the personnel here wouldn't let me bring them in, it's like I was concealing a lock picking kit or something. - Thanks anyway. - Yeah, sure. So, how are you? - I've been better. - Yeah, well, for what it's worth, I know you didn't do it, Sharon, I know you didn't kill Ann. - I'm glad. - Yeah. Now the detective made me say some things that I really didn't wanna say and I know it sounded bad but I told him you didn't do it and I'm gonna say the same thing in court. - Thanks. It's just it's really scary in here and seeing you makes me feel better. - That means a lot. - [Announcer] Visiting hours are now over. - Damn, I'll come earlier next time. So, Sharon, if you need anything, anything anything at all, just magazines or candy, anything just let me know, okay? - Okay. - You won't be in here long, Sharon, I know you won't. - I hope you're right. (dramatic music) (metal clanks) (alarm sounds) (police sirens blare) - No, you don't understand, you don't understand it's not what you think, that's my car! - [Detective] When did you first suspect something had gone wrong? - The day before yesterday when she wasn't where I was supposed to call her. - The motel in Eureka. - Yeah. - So you haven't spoken to her in two days. - I told you, she hasn't been to any of the places where I supposed to call her. - And still you didn't come to us. - It was like Ann accomplished a fraud or something, I don't know, I'm not gonna call the cops. - Not even when it was obvious she never made it back to the getaway car. Why were you trying to steal the car? - I wasn't stealing the car, I was checking to see if the suitcases were still in it. - In other words tamper with evidence. - No, that's not what it was. - We got your rap sheet from San Diego, Paul. You were a very busy boy down there weren't you? Grand larceny, assault. - Look, I had no reason to hurt Ann. I loved her. - No reason, how about her will. You know her lawyer tells me you're a very rich man. - Damn it, I told her not to do that, I told her it would look suspicious. - Is that right? - Yeah, she said that once people thought she dead that that would be the quickest way for us to get her money. I told her it was a dumb idea. - I'll buy that and I'll go you one better, you told her it was a dumb idea but you knew she'd do it anyway. And you got to thinking about that will and all that money and it started to look like the deal of a lifetime. - No, that's not what it was. - So that night, in the middle of helping stage her murder, you met her on the bank of the river and you finished what you started - No, no, no only this time that's not what happened! it was for real! And everything would have been fine except when you went back to move the getaway car it was gone. - I was worried about her. - Sure you were. - I didn't kill her. I don't know what happened to her. - Mom. - Baby. - Momma. - Please sit. - What is it? - We're dropping the charges against you Mrs. McKay, as soon as the paperwork is processed, you're free to leave. - Oh god. - They've arrested Paul Lear. - Why? - We're holding him on a breaking and entering charge but he's confessed to helping Ann go over the cliff that night. - He helped her jump. - He helped her fake the murder. - Fake the murder? Oh my god. Ann's alive. - Actually no. - We have reason to believe Paul killed her. - Paul would never kill her. - Well, it looks like he did. - The way it looked like I killed her. Don't you get it? - Get what sweetheart? - Ann isn't dead. - Mrs. McKay that makes no sense. - It doesn't have to make sense. - Welcome home, sweetie, I'll start dinner. - Thanks Mom. (dramatic piano music) (ominous music) (dog barks) Mom, Mom! - What? What is it? - There's somebody out there. (suspenseful music) (tires squeal) - What are you doing? - That looks like Ann's car! - Sharon, no! (tires squeal) (dramatic music) Ann! Ann? (ominous music) (thunder rumbles) Ann? Ann? Oh my god, oh my god, no, no! - Sharon, oh you scared me, what are you doing here? (Sharon cries) - I saw her. - What? - I saw her, she was out there, she was out there spying on me. - What are you talking about, who was, who? - I tried to follow her and then I lost her and I thought maybe she came here. - Who? - Ann. - Ann, Ann? - Chad, she's alive, Ann's alive. (dramatic music) It was Ann, I know it was. - Did you see her? - No. - Did you get the license number of the car? - No, but it looked like a Corvette. - Where's Ann's Corvette now? - It's at the house. - Was anybody driving it tonight? - No, I took it out this afternoon but I was back by five. - Were you home all night? - Yes in my apartment till I came down to make some dinner. - While you were in your apartment, could someone have driven off in the Corvette without your knowing it? - Well, sure, I was watching TV, somebody could have- - Did you hear anybody? - No. - Look, Miss McKay people know you were released today and unfortunately until the next big scandal blows in, you're gonna be fair game for every crazy in town. - It was not some crazy, I'm telling you it was Ann! - And I'm telling you Ann Price is dead! - How could you be so sure about that? - Yeah, I mean, you haven't even found her body. - Either the jump killed her or his brother did. And personally I'm putting my money on his brother. We'll beef up patrols in your neighborhood in case peeping Tom comes back, in the meantime I strongly suggest you try and get your life back on track and forget about all this. - You believe me don't you? - I'd like to. - But you don't. - Look, I know what you're going through, Sharon, really I do, it's hard to admit that Ann is gone so it's like you're holding onto the hope, hope that she's still alive. - No, I'm not. - Look, I felt the same way about her. She was impossible you know, she's not an easy person to let go of, she's not but I think that's what we have to do. We have to begin to let go. - Maybe you're right. - You're lucky, I wished I could have seen her one last time. (slow music) I talked to your attorney and he said if they don't bring you up on the breaking and entering charges, they're gonna have to release you. - Forget the B&E, they're getting ready to charge me with Ann's murder. There's something about that night that I didn't tell the police. When I went over the side to release the rope, it kind of felt like maybe Ann was still attached to it. - So what are you saying that you might have dumped her in the river? - No, I don't think so, but I might have banged her up a little. - Oh my god. - Pick up the phone. Look, I didn't kill her, all right, I know that, I think she's still alive. - Well, Sharon seems to think so too. - Yeah, yeah, look, there's something else, I dropped my knife when I went over the side to dump the rope. - Your ivory-handled knife. - Right, right, I need to know if it's still out there because if Ann is still alive and she's trying to frame me, she could use it against me. - What? - I need you to find that knife. - You wanna go back to the park, I'm not, no, I'm not doing back. - You've got to, damn it. - No, why? - Because we're family you idiot. - I'm not an idiot. Hey you tell me something, Paul, did you ever love Ann or was you just interested in her money? - I loved her, I do love her. - I doubt it. - Just find that knife, please. (dramatic piano music) (ominous music) - [Chad] Listen I'm glad you called me, you sounded really upset. - I know someone was following me. - You think it was Ann. - I don't know who it was but I- - What you have to do is you have to go back to the police. - No, no, no, no, no, no forget about the police, forget about them because somebody's gonna have to kill me before they give a damn! - I need to ask your advice about something. - What about? - Paul wants me to go back to Shannon Falls. - Why? - Well, he lost his knife out there that night, he wants me to go back and try to find it. - Oh. - I don't think it's such a good idea and actually going back there at this point kind of weirds me out. - No, you know what I think you should go. I think we both should go. - I don't think this is a good idea. - Why not? - Well, I, well to begin with a lot of bad things happened out there to you. - A lot of bad stuff is happening to me here. - What if we find something? - Like the knife? - Like or something worse, huh? - Listen I really, really need to know what happened out there. - I do too. - I wanna go. - Okay, okay. - [Man] Will somebody ask Ted were the extra gels are? - [Man] It's over by the keyboard man. - Hey. - Hey. What about Paul in the paper? Pretty weird huh. - Yes, it is. - I wanted to talk to you about that car. - What car? - The one out by the park. - This one? - Yeah. - What about it? - Well, I saw it that night. - Oh yeah? - Yeah on my way back from calling the cops, it was right off that access road where we came in, you saw it too right? - No I didn't. - Really? - No. I thought I saw you out there. - It wasn't me. - Well, okay, man whatever but I have to tell the cops what I saw so maybe we oughta synchronize our watches. - Sure, sure, you want a beer? - Yeah. - Go on in, drink a couple, I be right in. (men laugh) (dramatic music) All set? - All set. (engine revs) (ominous music) - Do you have a plan? - I'm gonna repel down, see if the knife landed somewhere along the side of the cliff. - Okay, I'll hike down and meet you at the bottom. - You don't wanna climb down with me? - Very funny. (dramatic music) - Did you find anything? - No, I didn't think I would. Are you hungry? - I could eat. - Yeah? - Hmm-mm. - I packed us a lunch. - Okay. - Yeah, we could move downstream a little ways if this place makes you feel uncomfortable. - No, I'm not, I think I'll be okay. - Okay, good. (engine revs) - Are you sure you should be going in there? - Yeah, well, you know, they're my shoes, she was only borrowing them. - So, buy another pair. - They're Armani. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (woman screams) - This is really good. - How can you mess up a ham sandwich, you know, it's ham and bread, cheese lettuce. (Sharon chuckles) Oh, here, here, this is good, this works great. - Oh, thanks. - It's all right. - Here. - No, no, just keep it, I got another one. Hey you wanna see something cool? - Sure. - It may seem a little weird at first but you gotta trust me, you trust me right? - Yeah, I trust you. - Okay. - You okay? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Uh-huh. - Just hold on in the dark, it's a little slippery on the moss, you've gotta watch out for here. Now I happen to remember some Indian paintings here. (Chad and Sharon laugh) They're not exactly Indian paintings, okay. - Indian paintings. (Sharon hollers) - Where'd that come from? (Chad laughs) You okay? - Yeah, I think so. - Okay, just take it easy, just hang in there. Look at this, huh, isn't this something? - Oh. - Huh? - It's amazing. - Look at that. It's like a sanctuary. (dramatic music) Come on, come on. - I can't see the bottom, oh god, that's cold. I'm coming. - Yeah, oh yeah, it's a little chilly but watch your step right there, come on. All right. - Yeah. - You did it, you're all right. - Yeah. - Huh? - Yeah, I'm just a little cold. - You're cold, yeah. Is that better? - Yeah. (slow music) - What's why, what is it? - What's that? - [Chad] What is it, Sharon? - Oh god, it's Ann's ring. It's the one you gave her. (dramatic music) (Sharon screams) (police sirens blare) - No, there was no one else in the house. - Only Nico. - And as far as you know the only person living here is Chad Lear. - You don't think that Chad. (Sharon hollers) - Sharon, Sharon, Sharon, listen to me. What we have to do, Sharon, we have to go back to town, okay, we should go to the police. I brought Paul here once and that's what it was, you see, he must have remembered it. Are you okay? - Chad gave it to me. - I'm fine. It's Ann's ring, the one that you gave her. (dramatic music) Where have you been, why are you all wet? - I thought I saw something in the water, it turned out to be nothing. - Detective Baker, hi. - Is Sharon here? - No, she went camping. - We're trying to find Chad Lear. - He's with Sharon. - She went camping with him? (dramatic music) (Ann screams) (Ann thuds) (Ann laughs) - You got it? - Oh good, thank you, Paul, oh god. (men grunt) - What did you find? - Huh? - What did you see? - I didn't see anything. (dramatic music) Hey Ann! Hey Ann! Ann! Ann! It's me. Oh god, you're alive. (dramatic music) So, what are you saying, you're just gonna disappear? - Let go of me. You're gonna ruin everything Chad. - You were gonna make me think that you were dead? - This has nothing to do with you. - You see I love you! - What? (Ann giggles) - I'm in love with you. - You're in love with me? That's too funny. You moron, you wouldn't dare hurt me, Chad. (Chad grunts) What are you doing? (dramatic music) - Sharon. (climactic music) (Ann cries) (climactic music) Sharon! No, no. (police sirens blare) - Give me the ranger's station in Shannon Falls. - No, no, oh my god! No, no! (Sharon cries) (suspenseful music) (Ann screams) (Sharon cries) (suspenseful music) (Sharon cries) (police sirens blare) (Sharon cries) - I should have known you'd run away, I should have known you'd run away. - Chad, Chad, just calm down. - No, see you said you wanted to know what happened! But you didn't. - No I did. - You don't care about me, you don't trust me. You're just like Ann. - No, no, I'm not. - No, no, no, you're exactly like her. I told her that I loved her and she laughed at me. (Sharon cries) - I've never laughed at you. - Ann, Paul and Jerry, they think I'm stupid, they think I'm dirt. - I don't think that. - It was me who invited Paul to move up here, it was me who got him a job at Ann's and then he stole her from me. - Chad, listen, whatever happened up here that night, I don't care. - You're exactly like them, come here! - No, Chad, no! - Come here, come here! I should kill you like I did Ann, like I did Jerry! - No, Chad, Chad, listen to me, you didn't kill Jerry, it was just an accident. - Of course I killed him. - What? - He walked right into my place without asking me, he picked up my diary, Sharon, my personal diary, he read it like it was his. - You keep a diary, Chad, I keep one too. - I write down everything in there. I write down what I'm thinking and what I'm feeling. It's my book, Sharon, it's my personal book and nobody has the right to read that book, nobody. Listen, now, wait, what gives you the right, you came in here you read it! You read it, how could you come in here and read that! You don't even know what's in there! It's a lot of stuff in there about Ann, a lot of stuff in there about how I felt about her and Jerry read it and Jerry laughed at me, he said he couldn't wait to tell Ann about it. And Paul, he was gonna tell him, Sharon, I was so angry. A lot of people think I'm stupid but I'm not. I just knew what to do and I fooled everybody. I drove him to the tracks, I waited for the train to come and then I left him there. He was drunk and confused. He never knew what hit him, neither did anybody else and you wanna know something, I was right about Ann that night out there. She laughed at me and I knew that she would never love me. That I was pathetic and disgusting and stupid, I hated her. I hated her. - You poor baby. - What? - Then laughing at you like that, that's so cruel. - Well, you're no different, you were trying to run away. - No, it was only because I was scared and confused and if you would have told me all this before I wouldn't have. - Yes, you would have. - No, why should I care that you killed Ann, look at what she tried to do to me or Jerry, I didn't care about him. - No. - But what about when you kissed me in the cave, didn't you mean it or were you laughing at me? - Of course I meant it. - So did I. I wished you kiss me again. (suspenseful music) - Sharon! (suspenseful music) - Oh, no. (suspenseful music) - That was a really stupid thing to do, Sharon! - Oh why? - Because I'm gonna throw you off the rope and I'm gonna tell them that you fell. - They won't believe you. - Oh yes they will believe me. (sirens blare) - That was you stalking me wasn't it Chad? - I was not stalking you. - Then what was you doing? - I was getting close to you. When you was scared you asked me for comfort and I liked that. - You know what, I think that's really sick! - That was a nice try. (Sharon screams) God! Now you're really pissing me off Sharon. Sharon! - Oh my god! (sirens blare) (suspenseful music) - Spread out! (suspenseful music) - Don't you come near me! - Or what? - I mean it! - No you don't! - Yes I do! No, no! (Chad hollers) - You cut me. - Oh my god! Give me your hand. - I can't believe you cut me. - Please! (Sharon cries) (suspenseful music) No! No! Oh my god! (Sharon cries) - Looks like I got here just in time. - Hello. - You picked a good day to fly. It's for you. - What is it? - A little going away present. They're gift certificates to my favorite New York deli. Pastrami like you wouldn't believe. - Thanks. - So, I guess you heard about Ann's will. - Front page news. - Paul comes out a winner, set for life. - Yeah, well, life is pretty weird. - You can say that again. Well, look I just wanted to wish you well. You knock them dead in the Big Apple. - Thank you. (slow piano music) (upbeat music) (woman laughs) ♪ I don't know what tomorrow will bring our way ♪ ♪ So I satisfy my soul with the smoke ♪ ♪ That I smoke each day - Sharon, oh what are you doing? - If everything had gone as planned, I'd be in jail right now wouldn't I? - Let me up Sharon, please, please? - Now that I can live with but you know what really hurts? You never even apologized. - I'm sorry, Sharon, I. (suspenseful music) Oh my god, I'm so sorry, Sharon. - Too late.
