As-Salaam-Alaikum This is capt. Shahid speaking. Ladies and Gentlemen, we regret to announce that... ...due to the ongoing tense situation in Islamabad... ...we have to land this airplane in Lahore. We request you to not panic. All your queries will be attended at Lahore Airport. Keep seated, sir. Don't panic, sir. Everything will be fine. Amidst the commotion created by this announcement... ...there was only one question on my mind. What about my mission now? Come. "For security sake, Pakistan has shut down all routes to Islamabad..." "...and increased security." "The terrorists have once again succeeded in their motives." "Yes... Islamabad has been rocked by six blasts in the most crowded areas."** Maintain a proper line... Stay back. Next. You're an Indian. - Yes. Well...your visa is for Islamabad. You cannot enter Lahore. - What? You'll be sent to Islamabad by flight. And until flight services to Islamabad resume... ...you will stay at the hotel. But I have to get to Islamabad urgently. Straying out of your hotel will be considered illegal! Actually... - Akram. Yes, ma'am. - Please. Take this gentleman to the hotel, and keep an eye on him. - Yes. Please... - Please listen to me. Go on... - Come with me. Next. Keep moving? - Come. I need to use the washroom. - Washroom? This way. Come on, hurry up. Dead body! Dead body! - Where? There's a dead body inside. Hey... Open the door! The Indian boy has escaped. I repeat, the Indian boy has escaped. Will you take me to Islamabad? What? Will you take me to Islamabad? Hey Bashir what sort of work have they got us into. Straight? - This way. Straight? - This way. Wake up. This taxi is occupied. - But it's completely empty, Bhaiya. Will you take me? Where do you want to go? - Islamabad. Islamabad? It's urgent, I'll pay you extra. Sir, money won't matter when you're dead. Islamabad is under attack. I know. But it's very important. I cannot wait until tomorrow. Sit. Allah! Will you take me to Islamabad? You just said it's important. So one can't argue when it's important. Sit. "Mirrors are forged in fire." "Without the oarsman... the boat's irrelevant." "When you and I come together..." "...the time moves, and the world seems a better place." "A sage once said Be a diamond of love" "A sage once said Be a diamond of love" "Let the light in your heart, and your eyes burn." "And the world will never plunge into darkness." "Keep the light in your heart...alight." "Then the world will never plunge into darkness." "Keep walking down the path." "God bless..." "God bless..." "God bless..." "God bless..." Why did you stop the car? Do people in India talk on the phone while driving? How do you know I am an Indian? I have been around a while, Bhaiya Yes Sure. Your orders will be complied with. InSha'Allah.. Allah Hafiz. What happened? I got down to pee... and dropped some coins. I was just looking for them. Well, your country's coins are useless here. Sit. 'Allah Allah Allah' Would you like a sip? - No. Sit. - Yes. Sir, why are you risking your life and going to Islamabad? It's personal. Personal? You see sir...for the terrorists... ...we're ordinary public - You and me both.. I am risking my life here. Tell me. It's a long story. The journey isn't short either. After dad's death, mom had brought me to Dubai. To my granny. And I had just one question for my mom. When are we going back to India, mom? We'll stay here now. - I don't want to stay here. All my friends are in India. - Stop it, Sid. Finish your food. What is it? Why do you pinch me every time, mom? Well...every time you scold my child, I will pinch you. Chuchu, don't be upset over what mom said. Granny...I am not Chuchu, I am Sid. Chuchu! Why do you call him Chuchu? He never liked that name. So don't call him that. That's not a big deal. Fine, I'll call him Pupu from tomorrow. I am very adjusting, you know that. Pupu! You're just unbelievable. No matter how tense the situation is... ...you always have a joke for the occasion. I don't joke around for fun, I do it to make others happy. If I start worrying about every trivial thing... ...then who will look after my child! Come, my child. Take it easy, dear. Learn to stay happy. I am happy, mom. I am just worried about Sid. That is all. I just don't know how to... How to handle him. Sid's just like your dad. Even he loves Tennis. I...will take Sid to his club tomorrow. And get him enrolled. He'll make new friends. And he'll never talk about going to India again. It's not that easy. Getting admission in the academy is not easy. And we don't know anyone there. Mr. Bhalla. Bhalla uncle? - He's the coach there. After your dad passed away. ...Bhalla ji became... my special friend. What? My boyfriend. - What? And he loves me. - What? What...what... Can't I have a boyfriend? And don't worry. We only got as far as a kiss. Mom, I don't want to know. Mom...please.. Listen to me... she's blushing. Harry ji... - Bhalla ji. 'Granny and Bhalla exchanged a few romantic words...' '...and I was enrolled in the club.' 'As they say...' '...every friendship begins with a fight.' 'Something similar happened between Fahd and me.' 'I was very short-tempered.' 'And, I often ended up hurting other's feelings.' 'But one day Granny told me a really nice thing.' The one who makes others happy is the happiest. Right? 'And I set out to make someone happy.' My child... Hey... Hey girl...you're the best, my hope in life. Come on. I am sorry, mom. I am sorry. My first day at the club. And along with Fahd, I met a funny friend. Biman. Bangladeshi. When are you going to serve? I think I've to get my glasses changed again. Biman was funny but not Fahd. On the first day, he challenged me to a match. Fahd's dad was a famous tennis player. And wanted Fahd to be a tennis champion as well. - Fahd. - But due to his Asthma... - Fahd? ...Fahd didn't have the stamina to play singles. 'Ya Allah' And that day after watching our game, granny said... Partners. We're going to rock this now. 'Lashtam-Pashtam.' 'Lashtam-Pashtam?' My dad used to say it. Anything is possible if you put your mind to it.** 'Lashtam-Pashtam.'' So 'Lashtam-Pashtam.' 'Fahd looked innocent, but he was a romantic.' 'He liked an Afghani girl, Madiha.' 'One day we went to Madiha's dance class dressed as girls.' 'But had to run for our lives from the Pathan.' Stop. Rascals. Stop. Hey, stop! 'While trying to escape...' '...we arrived at a place, where we realized the depth of our friendship.' I am scared of heights. So am I Sid, but not when you're with me. Come on. Bro, don't ever let go. - I won't. 'Often there are sorrows hidden...' '...under the veil of happiness.' 'Fahd's dad was a heart patient, and that day...' My only regret is... ...that I can't see your winning match. I am sorry, Fahd. 'Granny promised Iftekhar uncle...' '...that Fahd and I will not just play the match together but also win it.' 'And Fahd will stay with us, in our home.' 'I knew what it meant to lose your father.' 'And I promised myself that I will always keep Fahd happy.' 'I was waiting for Fahd to come home. And just then... Sid... I am sorry bro, please... Sid... Leave him, son. Leave him. Catch him, uncle. He's going to Pakistan forever. Sir, please stop him...please. Sir, please stop him. Please. Uncle, please don't take him away. Sir, please tell him. I am sorry, Sid. But I have to go. First my Dad left me, now you're leaving me too. Fine, get lost and never come back. Sid. Sid. You came home yesterday, didn't you? How could you think that he can live in this house? A Pakistani. Fine, mom. You and Fahd can stay here. Sid and I will leave. Badi Ammi,...please don't ever tell Sid why I left. Come, let's eat. Who keeps calling you so often? Let's go. As-Salaam-Alaikum , Mr. Khan. Wa-Alaikum-Salaam, brother Salim. You haven't been here in a long time, Salim. What to do? It's not often I get a passenger for this route. And you got a fare...on this doomsday. Sir,...such days have now become the story of every city. We should get used to such incidents. Serve him water. Come, have a seat. Khan sir, where's the gentleman from? Doesn't look like a local to me. You're right. He's an Indian. He's our guest. He's en-route to Islamabad for something important. Why are they staring at me? Why are they coming towards me? Have you ever met Shahrukh Khan? Forget Shahrukh Khan... Salman's ruling the roost now. Have you ever met Salman? Let's talk about Shahrukh-Salman later. How's Big B (Amitabh Bachchan)? We mean Amitabh of course. I'm sure you must have seen him at least. Actually, ...although I am an Indian, I was raised in Dubai. I never had the opportunity to meet these stars. Come on buddy. We're luckier than you are... At least we see them every day...on television. Let's go. Come on. Stop scaring the kid. Were you scared? Come on, start. Fans of Indian actors in Pakistan? Really? Our countries have been divided... ...but we still share the same soil. Yes. Mr. Khan, it was delicious. Son, wash my hands. How much? Oh, sir... What are you saying? I can't charge my Guest. I will go to hell. May Allah forgive me. You're our guest. Allah Hafiz. Allah Hafiz. That's it. What were you trying to do? Nothing... - Let it be. Lahore is known for its hospitality. Yes. Allah Hafiz Mr. Khan. Allah Hafiz - See you on my way back. You are always welcome. Yes sir, ...let's continue with your story. Catch it, catch it. And with this ace Siddhant Oberoi is once again the champion of Inter UAE Tennis Tournament. Bravo. Hi, handsome. Stop staring at me... Like a pigeon. Are you hitting on me? Shameless, I am as old as your granny. Not granny,... Badi Ammi. Fahd? My child! Sid... - No! Why? - I'll meet him personally. Hello. No, I am coming. On my way. Coming, okay. Sorry, son...I must go. But you meet with Sid until then. Give me a hug. I'll be back soon. Hey, carry on. Hey, Wait! Sorry. If you don't mind...may I? - I don't mind at all. I am Biman ul-Haq from Dhaka. I am the senior-most player of the club. How may I help you? May I? You want to...My brain... Of course...go ahead-go ahead! I'll stand outside. Are you a Tennis player? - I am...but not a pro. And you still want to play with me? Why not? My friend's dad used to say... "Anything's possible if you put your mind to it." "Lashtam Pashtam." Sid! Sid... Sid... Sid, listen to me. What are you doing, Sid? Leave me, Sid. What are you doing? Leave me, Sid. What are you doing? Where are you taking me? Sid... - Stay away, Fahd! What do you think? I can't stand here alone. See... I can stand up here... without you. Look. But not me. And running from that Pathan. We really got into a lot of trouble. Hey, Sid...really good to see you, buddy. You too. So tell me... - Yeah. Why did you come back? Father wanted to see us win together. Not just me on a video game. I want to win the tennis championship. I need your help. Bro...we will win. That's my promise. Lashtam Pashtam! Lashtam Pashtam! Forget all this... Tell me more...any girlfriend, or wife...or both? None... Just that girl...in the dance class. Who? Madiha? The one we got punished for. I see her on Facebook sometimes. - What are you saying? Listen...can you introduce me to her. We'll find someone else if I can't Listen... "Lashtam Pashtam..." "Ibn-e-adam." "Stay happy for as long as you can." "Lashtam Pashtam..." "Ibn-e-adam." "Stay happy for as long as you can." "Doesn't matter if we can't find her, we'll find someone else."

"If we miss the bus, we'll catch another one." Naeem, walk this side. Really? I know it was a tough one. You know...you will never change. Well, I'll message you. Naeem. Naeem. Naeem. What's wrong with him? Naeem. Allah, what's wrong with my son? Look, I am really sorry, I didn't mean to... Will your apology stop his bleeding? Son... Is it paining a lot? Say something. Why isn't he saying something? - Naeem can't speak. You should call the police man. - Yeah. What are you doing? - Calling the ambulance... Who knows when will the ambulance arrive. If you want to help, take us to the hospital. Yes, of course. Take a left. - Left. But City Hospital is... - Just do as I say! Yes! My son... Stop...stop here. - Here? Please Listen to me. If there is anything I can do for you. Come Naeem. I'll be really grateful to you... ...if you don't mention this to anyone. Goodbye. 'I figured that Zayanah was living illegally in Dubai.' 'Maybe that was the reason she didn't call the Police or Ambulance.' As salaam alaikum - Wa alaikum salaam Uncle, what are those tennis balls doing there? That one? - Yes. I think your brother visits frequently. He must have kept it. Brother... That's what he said. Let it go. Hi. How are you, champ? Sorry... how is he? - He's fine. Good. By the way, what are you doing here? Naeem left his bag in your car. - Oh yes...just a second. Thank you. - Okay. Excuse me, I can leave you anywhere you want. Thank you very much, But I won't give anyone a chance to leave me again. Goodbye! Goodbye! Just a second. Yes. Fahd. I will make you meet her tomorrow for sure. What? - What? What are you two doing? - Looking at her face. What? He means Fahd's face. Look at him, he's so shy in front of you. I see. - Sid... What happened to his shyness... ...when he came to my dance class dressed as a girl? Well, it was Sid's... - Sid. Are you looking to have an affair with me or Sid? Speak up, mister. Now tell me... Are you in love with me? Do you want to kiss me? What? Are you going to do it or should I? Shut up, Biman. I told you...she definitely has a connection with Bhatinda. Bhatinda? What Bhatinda? It's a city in India. My granny is from Bhatinda. And you won't believe... ...that she kissed grandpa on their first date. I guess your thinking matches with my granny. When our thinking's so similar... ...then our actions should match too. You two continue with your actions and reactions. I am going. Hey... Sid. Hello. - You? Here? What are you doing here? - Trying to make a conversation with you. Huh! I need to speak with you urgently. This is an insolent effort. Should I work in the office or talk to you? Is your work more important or...Naeem? Naeem, of course. Then it's about Naeem. By the way, my name is Siddhant Oberoi. And people call me Sid politely. What do they call you impolitely? - What? Did you disturb me during my work to give your introduction? Just tell me what you wanted to say about Naeem. I've inquired about Dr. Riyaz. - Yes, so? He's a very good ENT Specialist. Do you know him? - Very well. But maybe you don't know about his fee. You don't worry about the fee. - Why not? I don't want any kind of help from you. And why do you want to do this? I saw Naeem's book. I can understand the pain of not having a dad. And I understand the pain...of having him. We mother-son are quite happy in our life. We don't need your favors. I... She has such a bitter tongue, like a Neem tree. Oh... Maybe that's why she named her son Naeem. But sister...where could Naeem go? He's not with any of his friends either. Allah...where do I look for him? Who do I tell... Sorry, but I couldn't stop myself. Actually, I took Naeem to see Dr. Riyaz. And you won't believe it, but Naeem can speak... How dare you take my son? - But I was... What? Do you know I can get in big trouble? I know. That's why I took Naeem's appointment as my guest. I am stubborn. Your slap won't make a difference. Next time I'll bring Naeem home on time. Don't worry. Goodbye. 'Dr. Riyaz said that Naeem's case was of self-mutism.' 'Maybe he stopped speaking because of a shock.' 'That's why I was putting Naeem in situations...' '...where he had to speak.' Look here look here. Say it... Beach. Beach. That's more like it. Son, say that you want to go pee. Say it. No, no, I won't let you go. Until you don't say it, I won't let you go. Say it. Come on, Naeem, tell the drive your address. Fahd, yours. Fahd. Thanks. Hello. Yes, Fine, I am coming. Yes, Sid. - Sorry, Fahd. I have to leave. What do you mean you've to leave? Let's practice tomorrow. See you. Sid. - See you. Why did Sid leave so suddenly? So what if he left. I'll help you practice. I taught Sid. Come on, let's practice. Whether it's India or Pakistan, everyone's scared of Bangladesh. Come on, rally up. Girls in Kabul don't wear mini skirts and hot pants. Yes, some do. - Really? But under the burkha. Hurry up, I am getting late for practice. Sid will be there soon. Really? But there he is. Good. Call him. Let's go together then. Fahd, in a meeting buddy. Will call you back. What happened? Nothing. Let's go. This is wrong, Sid. Why did you lie? We're supposed to take Naeem to the doctor today. Fahd wouldn't have understood. That's why. Relax, Fahd. Maybe you're wrong. And there's nothing between Sid and Zayanah. Madiha, you don't get it. Try to understand. I do get it. But they invited us and we must go. Come on, cheer up. Cheer up. "I wish this night never ends." "I wish this dance never stops." "This moment is filled with no worries." "There's a restlessness in my heart." "Your spell's growing on me..." "...I wish it keeps me enchanted." "Cover me in your love..." "...come with me." "O beloved..." "...come to me." "Let's steal some moments away tonight." "And say what's in our heart." "Let's steal some moments away tonight." "And say what's in our heart." "You're like the dawn in my life..." "...I can feel your grace surrounding me." "You're like the dawn in my life..." "...I can feel your grace surrounding me." "I wish this night never ends." "I wish this dance never stops." "This moment is filled with no worries." "There's a restlessness in my heart." "Your spell's growing on me..." "...I wish it keeps me enchanted." "The heart's speaking out to you..." "...there's a story on my lips too." "The heart's speaking out to you..." "...there's a story on my lips too." "All I need is your permission..." "...to reveal the secrets in my heart too." "All I need is your permission..." "...to reveal the secrets in my heart too." "I wish this night never ends." "I wish this dance never stops." "This moment is filled with no worries." "There's a restlessness in my heart." "Your spell's growing on me..." "...I wish it keeps me enchanted." "Cover me in your love..." "...come with me." "O beloved..." "...come to me." Naeem! What did you do? The Holy Book's wet. You've become very mischievous! I'll set you straight... - Hey Zayanah. What are you doing? That's no way to hit a kid. Naeem. Where are you taking us? - Naeem. Oh, God. Why didn't you tell me? Naeem, come with me. Come on. Let's go. - Naeem. Naeem. Where are you taking him Sid. Sid. Sid. Naeem. Taxi! Taxi. Follow that car. Hurry up, please. That...that car...that one. Come on, you're going to speak today. Remember, Naeem. You can't go home... ...without saying your address yourself. Never! Naeem. Naeem. Leave me! This is an awful way to make a kid talk. Leave me... - Quiet. Mother! Naeem. Naeem. If the pic is nice, it deserves a like. I was wondering how this pic got so many likes. What? By the way, what brings you here? I thought maybe we could go out for coffee. Salaam Here...the best 'Sindhris' straight from home. Thank you, Gusal Khan brother. Don't mind, sir...but the sweetest mangoes are from our country. Alphonsos! Have you ever tried them? I have tried them. But Alphonsos are no match to Sindhris. Don't say anything about Alphonsos. I grew up eating them. You grew up eating them. But look at me. I grew so huge eating 'Sindhris'. Nothing's sweeter than 'Sindhris'. I am telling you Alphonsos are sweeter. Sindhri! - Alphonsos! Sindhri! - Alphonsos! Sindhri! - Alphonsos! Sindhri! - Alphonsos! This silly quarrel between India and Pakistan got me beaten up. And all for this mango. These Sindhris are really sweet. Forget this mango. Let's just jump from here. - Why? Why? Because you're Pakistani and I am Indian. After we're dead, all problems end. Come on, let's jump. Sid, please wait. What wait? When Alphonsos and Sindhris are equally sweet, then... ...where does this bitterness come from? On that note, Let's just jump. Come on...come. Wait, Sid. Wait a minute. You're drunk. Leave this. Leave it. Leave what? Whenever I truly loved someone, Zayanah. They left me alone. First my father... Then Fahd. And now you will leave me too. Because you're Pakistani and I am Indian. Come on. After we're dead, all problems end. Come on... Let's jump... - No... Sid, if you jump...it will just add to problems. Please, sit down. My problems will increase when you will leave me. And with you, Naeem will leave too. Please don't do it. I see myself in Naeem. My childhood. Zayanah, you're a nice girl. Wear this. Wear it...quickly. As Salaam Alaikum, sir. - Wa Alaikum Salaam. Where are you off to? - Islamabad, sir. My mother passed away. She wasn't even ill. Sir, what's your name? It's Sid... Siddiqui Asif. No matter how many disguises you put on... ...but you cannot fool me. Understood. Come out. Listen to me. - I said come out. Let's talk about the dead body. The stories in our films may be weak... ...but, not as much as the one you're telling us. Ishtiak, let me tell you a story now. Indians arrive...and bring terror along. Please, sir, try to understand. You're getting me wrong. Shut up. Sir, I must get to Islamabad right now. It's more important for you to be tossed behind bars. Once you spend few days behind bars... Get in! Catch them! Catch them! I want to know what was the need for all this. I always knew he's not a good guy. Where are you taking me? What is this place? Come out. I said come out. What are you doing? Risking my life to help you. - Help. This is no way to help me. You just proved to them that I am a terrorist. Our countries don't need proof... Finding a Pakistani in India, and an Indian in Pakistan under such circumstances... ...clearly indicate only one thing. Terrorist. And you sir escaped from the airport! That's like adding insult to injury. For 10 long years, they would've asked you your motive for coming to Pakistan. And finally one day... ...you would've given up and admitted. I came here to set off bombs. Hang me. I want peace! But I still don't understand why you're helping me? Is it necessary to have a reason to help someone? If I were stuck in a similar situation in India... ...would you have asked for a reason to help me? My father's grave is in Lucknow, Hazrat Ganj. For years I wanted to go there and sit next to his grave and pray. But how? Curse these leaders. We're all born from the same soil. Why do we doubt each other? I'll call you back. This Hukumat, she's my wife. She's been calling me since morning, because she's scared... ...as I am traveling with an Indian. Who is spreading this hatred? A handful of people in your country... ...and a handful in mine, are spreading this terror. For centuries. Was there a Pakistan? We were one country! We used to live together. A small spat...but that happens between everyone. Between families, brothers. Where did this hatred come from? Who is responsible for it? Why? Why? Why do we doubt each other? Sit. I said sit. Sorry. Should I tell you the story further? Go on... What do I say... No one knows about Sid's whereabouts. I do. 5005, Princess Tower, Dubai Marina. Crazy. Shut up, please. Forget about showing up for practice... ...I can't even get him to talk to me. Look...I think you should let him do what he wants to do. You should focus on your practice. This is a double's tournament. "O beautiful moon..." "...make me a mouthful of candy." "Go to sleep, my prince..." Coffee. - Thanks. My father used to sing this lullaby to me. And now, you sing it to Naeem. Has Naeem ever met your parents? No. And, I guess we will never be able to meet them. - Why not? I am trying to find out the procedure you make you legal. Then you and Naeem can easily go to Pakistan. You can make me legal in Dubai, Sid... ...but, not in the eyes of my parents. They went through a lot of hardships to get me married. Even today they proudly tell everyone that... ...our Zayanah lives in Dubai, like a princess. They don't know the truth, Sid. I don't have the courage to face them and answer their questions. I don't know why am I telling you all this. There are some people you don't want to keep secrets from. You're that first person in my life... Sid, why are you being so naive? - Naive? Don't even think... - You too? Do you have any idea what you're saying? - No...stop twisting your words. Say it clearly. What do you mean? - I mean I admit she has a kid... ...and belongs to a different religion, she's a divorcee. Sid, you're getting me wrong. - Fahd, please. Just because I am not able to give you time for practice... ...you have a problem with my other relationships. Sid, listen to me. - You listen to me. I promised you that I'll help you win the tournament... ...and I will keep my promise. It's not about the tournament... - Don't comment on my personal life again. Sid, listen to me. How do I explain you... ...there will never be a place for a Pakistani in your family? I don't believe it. Look...we're modern as well. But you are just redefining modern. Son...please stay clear of this divorcee and readymade family. Think. Think. Granny, you always say... Those who think never take action. I cannot live without Naeem and Zayanah. Sid! Don't worry, dear. I am explaining this fool. - Hold on, mom. Have you gone mad? Pakistani? I am never gonna let that happen you know that. What? Why are you talking like this, mom? I wish I had said this 16 years ago... ...then maybe your dad would've been still alive. Please dear...go inside. - Just a minute, granny. How is dad involved in all this? When you're talking about your dad's murderers... ...then he's automatically dragged into this. For God's sake, dear...don't go that far. Do you know that you dad didn't die in the battlefield? He was murdered in our own house, by his closest friend. Because he was a Pakistani spy. Just because your dad didn't disclose some information... ...he slit his throat brutally like an animal. Come, dear. Let's go. I can endure anything... but a Pakistani... Let's go inside, dear. Let's go. I'll do anything you say. But I can't live with those murderers. Please don't do it. Please. Sid. Good morning, son. - Let me sleep, granny...please. - Get up.** Get up...get up, son. Son... Fahd's called three times since morning. Talk to him. Here. Get up, my son. Talk to him. Hello. - Everything alright? Yes. The tournament is starting in a couple of days. Let's practice. You need to practice, Fahd. Not me. - What? We'll meet on the day of the match. Sid... Hello. Where is Siddhant? I don't know. He hasn't been coming for practice for few days. Ready, Serve. "The heart's been stabbed, but the body's is alive." "The body is like a stubborn bird." "The heart's been stabbed, but the body's is alive." "The body is like a stubborn bird." "Keep flying..." What's wrong, Harry? All okay? Sid uncle. Naeem, careful. Why didn't you come meet me for so many days? I am sure you've dealt with all your important work. So let's plan for the game. It's alright. Good players don't plan... They just play. Come on, buck up... You're missing such easy shots, Sid...where is your focus? Your focus is on the game, right. You missed a shot too. That's why I kept insisting that you come for practice. Teaching a kid how to speak... ...and chasing after his mother isn't practice. Stay in your limit, Fahd. - Play the game... Everyone knows who's intentionally playing bad... ...and who our opponents are At least stop favoring your countrymen here! Hold on a second. What did you just say? - Get lost... Go and play bad intentionally. How dare you, Sid? How dare you misbehave? Misbehave? Why don't you serve them this game on a platter? Don't involve me in this. You have such cheap thinking. This is a warning. You must stop now. Mom was right. One should never trust the likes of you! Then go sit in your mother's lap... - Fahd! Sid. Sid? - Granny. Shameless. What Pakistan? What India? You came here from India when you were just a kid. And today you're telling us the distance between India and Pakistan. Mom Please stop creating a scene Get lost! Go away! This is all your fault. You spread this bitterness. And today I am going to clean up this mess once and for all. Harry... - Enough, Mr. Bhalla. Be quiet. Granny, listen to me. And you? What? What is your problem? Just because one Pakistani killed your father... ...are you going to treat all Pakistanis as your enemy... ...like your ignorant mother? Granny...please. Let's discuss this later. Everyone's listening. So let them listen. I am saying this loud and clear for them. We already have a lot of issues. Issues like Kashmir... Like Kargil... Issues of sports...cricket! The common man isn't thinking... ...what's happening across the border. "What's happening across the border!" He's worried about his own family. When his children go to school... ...they don't fall prey to some terrorist attack. Their girls...when they step out of the house, nothing bad happens to them. Granny, please... Stay back. And these evil-doers... are not from across the border! Listen... Clean up your own mess first. Your mess! Then think about cleaning other people's mess! Mom... Mom - Stay away. Change your thinking. Change your thinking, you fools. Look...Dubai won't tolerate your hatred! Neither will your granny! And before I kill you two... ...get out. Get out! Get out you Indian and get out you Pakistani! Get out! Mom, when is Sid uncle coming? Mom, when is Sid uncle coming? He's not coming. Why not? Don't you get it...he's not coming! He is never coming again! "Every inch of my soul..." "...is humming the song of your love." "Every inch of my soul..." "...is humming the song of your love." "How do I convey my pain in words?" "Who do I tell about my anguish?" "I am speechless..." "...and you're without a clue." "How can we meet..." "...since I am the earth, and you're the sky." "Every inch of my soul..." "...is humming the song of your love." "Every inch of my soul..." "...is humming the song of your love." Forgive me, Badi Ammi. When we became friends... ...I didn't know that Indians and Pakistanis are different. Some questions have no answer. Whatever you're doing is right? Badi Ammi...do I have your permission to leave? Will you stay if I ask you to? "Life is a valuable gift, you should know." "Life is a valuable gift, you should know." "You never know...when it'll pass away." "You never know...when it'll pass away." "Come see me know." "How do I convey my sighs?" "How do I show you my grieving eyes?" "I am speechless..." "...and you're without a clue." "How can we meet..." "...since I am the earth, and you're the sky." "Every inch of my soul..." "...is humming the song of your love." "Every inch of my soul..." "...is humming the song of your love." Sid. What have you done to yourself? I should've never told you the truth. Relax, mom. It's not your fault. I am trying...to hate people like Fahd. I'll get there. "This pain is making me breathless..." "...hear me, o friend." "This pain is making me breathless..." "...hear me, o friend." "Either shower me with love..." "Either shower me with love..." "Or alleviate this pain." "How do I convey my heart?" "Who do I show my tears to?" "I am speechless..." "...and you're without a clue." "How can we meet..." "...since I am the earth, and you're the sky." "Every inch of my soul..." "...is humming the song of your love." "Every inch of my soul..." "...is humming the song of your love." "How do I convey my sighs?" "How do I show you my grieving eyes?" "I am speechless..." "...and you're without a clue." "How can we meet..." "...since I am the earth, and you're the sky." "Every inch of my soul..." "...is humming the song of your love." Papa...please help me. Girl, you're the best. The hope in my life. - Hey... - Dad Come here. By the way, dad. What do you write in your diary? Son, whenever I am confused... ...I write my feelings in this diary. And your confusion's cleared? - Yes, son. Just write your feelings on paper. And your heart will tell you what's right and what's wrong. While writing my story... ...I was able to get some answers to my questions... But not satisfaction. My story was incomplete without Fahd. So Granny wanted me to go to Pakistan to meet Fahd. No, granny. I don't want to meet Fahd. Chuchu... Son...why are you still delusional? Today I'll tell you something... ...which I haven't even told your... silly mother. Watch... Move back. This is India 70 years ago. Now we... divide this in two parts. This is your India...and that's his Pakistan. Then we drew a line between the two ...and called it 'Border'. Back in 1947, my dad found me here. No one knows whether I...came from here... ...or whether I came from here. Whether I am Hindu or Muslim, no one knows. Now...if we see this biologically... ...then maybe I have Pakistani blood. The blood of a Pakistani Muslim. And if I've Pakistani blood... ...then that same blood runs in your silly mother. Or if someone could do a detailed study of my blood... ...and find out what's right... No, son...be quiet. You shouldn't cry. I am sorry. Only donkey's cry. Mom. Even I hid something from you. How could you think that he can live here? A Pakistani? After knowing the truth about Fahd, I realized... ...that he was never at fault. Sometimes, Mom kept him away from me. While other times, I did so myself. Sorry, Sid. When you meet Fahd, please apologize to him for me. Look...my story ended... and we reached Islamabad. So, I finally got you here. The police are still after us. Look, son. I tried my best. But you don't worry, Allah will surely help you. The address you're looking for is not too far from here. You'll get there sooner on foot. Go on, I'll handle them. - But you... Don't worry about me, go on. - Okay. Run. Uncle, which way is Sector F. Take a left. Find him. He must be somewhere around. Which way is sector F? There he is. Catch him. You cannot escape. Catch him. Move. Come on. Come on. I won't spare you. Hey... You cannot run too far. Look. Where is he? You two look that way. There he is. Move. I am coming... You cannot escape. Leave me. Heyyou. Move aside. Fahd. Fahd. Stop. Stop, or I'll shoot. Fahd. Fahd. - Keep sitting or you'll die. You made us run a lot. Sid. Fahd. Fahd. Come here. Stay back, lady. Stay back. Sid.. - This terrorist was trying to enter your house. Sir...sir... Sir, listen to me... Madiha, please explain to them. Fahd... Call the commissioner. Call the commissioner. - He's not a terrorist. - Get him inside. Listen to me. Come to the police station immediately. Come to the police station immediately. Fahd. Stop them, Fahd. Come to the police station immediately. Alhamdulillah Promotion. Finally I've got my hands on an Indian. Soon I'll be in-charge of a police station. And three stars on my uniform. As Salaam Alaikum sir. IG sir. Let the Indian go. - But, sir... I get it...but we have to follow the orders. Get the paperwork ready. It's your responsibility that he leaves our country tomorrow. Fahd. I knew you would forgive me. Thanks brother. I only helped you so that... ...you don't say that Pakistanis are cruel. You may go. Goodbye. Don't say that, buddy. I went through great troubles to get here. And I got into trouble after meeting you. I think it's best you leave. This Pakistani no longer wants to be friends with an Indian. You will take the first flight out to Dubai tomorrow. Yes. What happened to Sid? Is he okay? He's fine. He'll be sent back to Dubai tomorrow. What is this? Nothing. Look son...Allah's our biggest friend. If He wills...He will return your friend to you. And I am sure it will happen. Brother Salim, you have changed my thinking. I now look at life through a different point of view. I will always remember everything you did for me. Allah hafiz - Bless you. At least tell me the meaning of Lashtam Pashtam before you leave. What you did for me. By risking your life. Doing something with passion is Lashtam Pashtam. One way or another. Siddhant sir...you forgot your bag at Fahd sir's house yesterday. Where is Fahd? - He left for London. Goodbye. Sid. You're my life, my reason to stay alive. I love you, man. Thank you. Thanks...for writing the final chapter of our story. I did write it Sid, but we're yet to make it happen. Come on, come on, come on. Faster. "God be with you." "God be with you." Finally the day Fahd had been waiting for has arrived. We're at the finals of Nations Cup. And the dream of Fahd's father is very close now. Are you both stressed? Look son, winning and losing is not in the hand of the players. But playing well is. Just play well. Don't just play with each other. Play for each other. Then no one can defeat you two. Bravo. 'Zayanah, Whenever I loved someone, they left me.' Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sid uncle, I love you. - I love you too. "God be with you." "God be with you." "God be with you." "God be with you." 'Mom was right, we should never trust you people.' 'Then go hide in your mother's lap!' Lord...let them win. And I'll give you a tight hug. Bro, don't let go. - I won't. God is the greatest friend. If He wills, He will bring your friend back. Siddhant and Fahd have won the Nations cup. "It's the celebration of our victory..." "...the flag of love soaring high." "It's the celebration of our victory..." "...the flag of love soaring high."
