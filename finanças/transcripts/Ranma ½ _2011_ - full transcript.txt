Tendo Soun Akane, Nabiki, Kasumi. K ya! Men! Men! Men! Men! Me”! Kya! Meen! Meen! Meen! I-I-I lose! There's more to do! N-no way, no more! I quit! Eh? Quit?! Wait! Wait! Please, don't quit! I'll be gentler next time! Tendo Akane (youngest daughter) Tendo Akane (youngest daughter) No way, no way, no way, no way! No way, no way, no way, no way! He's coming! He's finally coming! Ranma-kun is coming!! Tendo Soun. Ouch! You're after this, aren't you, Ranma! Saotome Genma. Give it to me! Saotome Ranma. If you want it, come and get it yourself! Fine by me, damn old man! I'm sure everything will work out. Tendo Kasumi (oldest daughter) Tendo Kasumi (oldest daughter) You're too calm about this. You're too calm about this. That was our last student! Your hungry, right? Breakfast is almost ready. How much longer will it take? About five hours. Five hours! Maybe I should make it! Akane-chan, you shouldn't touch anything. Akane, Kasumi, he's coming! He'll be here soon! Who will? Father! Wa-water!! Pride... of the Fierce Tiger! Akane-chan... That's the hot water. Hot water? That's really hot! Ice. Ice! ICE! You need to concentrate when fighting. If you can't, then you will never become the strongest man in the world! Ah, there's a hot-looking woman over there! Where? It's you who needs more concentration! Pride... of the Fierce Tiger! Nabiki... You guys are so loud! Tendo Nabiki (2nd oldest daughter) What's this?! Ranma-kun is coming! To Tendo Soun: I'm coming with Ranma. - Saotome Genma Ranma-kun is coming! To Tendo Soun: I'm coming with Ranma. - Saotome Genma. To Tendo Soun: I'm coming with Ranma. - Saotome Genma Ranma-ku n? To Tendo Soun: I'm coming with Ranma. - Saotome Genma. So... who's that? As long as I know where the dojo is, I have no need for you! Wait, Ranma. Shut up! You should just stay lying down for the rest of your life! His name is Saotome Ranma, my best friend's only son. He just came back from China. Here, all done. It's been fifteen years since father and son went there for martial alts training. Martial arts training? Does he go around beating people up too, like Akane? It's not beating up. It's martial alts. It's still just violence used to beat up people, isn't it? You know, that "beating up," as you call it, is what supports this family. It's not supporting anything. You have zero students, right? Why don't we get rid of the dojo, and build an apartment! That will definitely bring in the money! I won't let that happen. Even if we don't do anything, it will fall apart anyway. I won't let it fall apart! Now, now, it's okay, Akane. That's why your fiancé Ranma-kun is coming. Fiancé? That's when parents decide on who you will marry. What?! Marriage?! Actually, some time ago, Genma-san asked me to take care of this letter. Once Ranma has become a full-fledged martial artist, he will marry you and inherit the dojo studio. Huh? You don't know how long I've waited for this day! Hold on there. I never heard anything about this. I mean, I can inherit the dojo studio even if I don't get married. Only men can be heirs. That's the tradition of the Tendo family. But I haven't even met this person. You will meet soon. It would be impossible for Kasumi-chan. She's no good at fighting. Is that so? But Nabiki-chan would probably sell the dojo once she married that person. Akane! Congratulations on your wedding! What?! Congratulations, my foot. Akane-chan, your lunch. How could Father do this?! That's true. I feel sorry for whoever marries you. That's not what I meant. Why is it that only a man can take over the dojo?! Gender doesn't matter! I'm gonna be the one that protects this dojo! Why are you taking pictures? Ah... I've been caught. Give it to me. Do you want to delete? Do you want to delete? Deleting... Deleted. How many times have I told you to stop doing this? I don't even know who you are. I'm your classmate, Gosunkugi. Gosunkugi Hikaru. Furinkan High School. He just came back from China. Don't worry, Akane. That's why your fiance' is coming. Excuse me? A sin? Who are you calling a g- Boobs again! What? Good morning! Good morning! Hey, could you show me how to get here? I want to go here, here! That's somewhere around here. This is Furinkan High School. Wait, I think this map is wrong. Note: Ore is the male form of "I". Where I want to go is... Ore? Um... Well... Anyway! I want to go to Tendo dojo! Tendo? Tendo Akane! Would you please stop doing this? I can't do that! Sorry, hold this. Hey, is your name Tendo? Stay back. It's dangerous. What the... Is that true? Nope. It's just some love battle. If I win... you'll have to date me. Akane-san! I don't remember making that promise. Ah, but that's the rule. I've never heard of that rule. Stop right there! He's here again. Good morning, Akane-kun. Good morning. Kendo Captain Kuno Tatewake. This school's kendo champion, known as Furinkan High School's blue lighting. Kuno Tatevvaki. If you want to date her, then you will have to defeat me first! You should stay back! Letch! What are you doing! Pervert! Letch! What are you doing! Wow, he's pretty good. I don't know anything about this 'love battle', but aren't you glad he saved you? He's the one who invented this problem for me. Oh? Please move aside, pigtailed girl. Girl? If you stay there you will get hurt. I'll get hurt? If you won't move, then that means you have an interest in me. It can't be helped. I will allow both of you to date me. Is it okay to kick his ass? I don't think you will win though. So strong. Don't call me a girl! Kuno was defeated? What's your name? I'm Ranma! Ranma?! Anything Goes Martial Arts, second in line, Saotome Ranma! Saotome Ranma (female form) Coming! I bet this is Saotome and Ranma-kun! But Akane didn't seem like she wanted to get married. Should I take over for her? The dojo won't be taken down! Genma-san! Sign: Hello!! Panda-san? Marriage?! That panda-old man! Panda? Ah, it's nothing. But I'm glad your a girl. If we are both girls that means we can't get married, right? Ah, no it's just my body isn't well... I'm Tendo Akane. Pleased to meet you! This is troublesome, Tendo-kun. Vice Principal. Okamada Kamoyo. Okamada Kamoyo I heard you beat up the male students again? I heard you beat up the male students again? I'm sorry for all this trouble. Really... Women! Ah, this is someone I know. Ranma-san, outsiders aren't allowed in school. Well then, take me to the legendary hot spring. Huh? The legendary hot spring. My dad said you guys had it at your place. That's why I came back all this way to Japan. We don't have any hot spring at our place. Akane-chan. Yo! Ono Tofu (Nurse's office teacher) Ono Tofu (Nurse's office teacher) Tofu-sensefif. Tofu-sensei! Hey, wait up! Nurse's Office. Nurse's Office Akane-chan 's fiance'? I guess father thought she was a guy. Laughable, right? That sounds like him. Hey, do you have hot water anywhere? I have tea, but would you like coffee instead? Ah, just the hot water. Okay. Here. Oh, thank you. Hot! Akane, if you were getting married, it would be better if it was to someone you like right? Someone I like? Don't you have anyone you like? Not really. Your name is Ranma-san, right? Hm? Why don't you wait here until Akane is done with class. Well... I guess there's no other way. Pardon me. Kasumi-san! Ah, Akane is here. Here is your lunch. Thank you. Here. I'm not sure if this fits your taste, Sensei. Note: kuchi ni au is the expression used, but kuchi means mouth and ni au means to look good in. Here. I'm not sure if this fits your taste, Sensei. Note: kuchi ni au is the expression used, but kuchi means mouth and ni au means to look good in. Oh, you're right. This fits my mouth perfectly. I didn't mean that. I meant these. Oh, that's right, Akane. Just a little while ago, a panda came to our door. A Panda? Hey, let's go! Go? Go where? To your house of course! But I have class now! Th-This is not okay! It is okay! Who was that? It's very tasty. That's a box. I have class, though! No time for that, where is your house?! Why should I take you there? Vice Principal? What is it? Excuse me, but can you come here for a moment? Sure. Hello, animal control? What are you doing? Excuse me... what? What are you doing? Stop that! What? If animal control comes, it would be such a waste! We're gonna make a fortune out of that panda! What are you saying? We're gonna make a fortune out of that panda! Is there really a panda? - Yeah. - Where is he? - He's in the bath. - Well, in the bath, there's, uh... Ranma-san! Ranma? So that's the legendary hot spring? Ranma-san? Ranma-san! Ranma-san! Damn you! Calling me your paren. Damn you! Calling me your paren- Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! I'm back. Are these the visitors? Sorry for all this trouble. I'm Saotome Genma, and this is my son. Ranma. Don't lie. Don't lie. It's not a lie! It's not a lie! Ranma-san was a girl. Onee-chan, you met her in the nurse's office right? Oh, what happened to her? That was me! Don't lie... That was me! Don't lie... - Don't lie... - Forget that! Forget that! What happened to my panda! Genma-san, what's this all about? Where do I start explaining... During our training we fell into the legendary Jusenkyo springs! Jusenkyo! What's that? In China, it's the most dangerous training water grounds. There is a legend that anyone who falls into the springs gets cursed! That's correct. Catalog of All Training Grounds in China. Anyone who falls into Jusenkyo waters will turn into whoever was the first to drown in it. Jusenkyo - Very Dangerous will turn into whoever was the first to drown in it.

And Ranma fell into the one where a young woman drowned 2,500 years ago. A Young woman! Wow. Or so you say. How stupid! Or so you say. It does sound stupid, doesn't it? Don't laugh about it! It's all your fault that this happened to us! Note: teme is the rude way to say you. How dare you use 'teme' to your father! This is no time for fighting! Why not just tell us the truth! Like I said this is all true! Genma-san! Ah! This is so annoying! What the hell was that for! No way! He became a girl! What? Eeeh! But why didn't that hot water cure me?! That wasn't the legendary hot spring that can turn anyone into a man. That was just plain hot water! What?! He turns into a girl when his head gets covered in cold water, and hot water turns him back into a man. Such a ridiculous body. Transformation occurs. You also have a ridiculous bodily transformation! My Panda! You also have a ridiculous bodily transformation! You also have a ridiculous bodily transformation! Where is that legendary hot spring?! If I can find that, I can turn back into a man, right? I hate being a woman, even for a few seconds! What do you mean by "hate being a woman"? You know, I was born a man! Well, too bad we don't have that hot spring, right? Yeah, we do. We do?! Originally, I only wanted to tell the person who would inherit this dojo about this. Not To Be Removed From the Premises. Not To Be Removed From the Premises However... However... for generations... our family, the Tend6s, have been protecting the secret of the legendary hot spring, Wafu Nannichuan. Wafu Nannichuan? What's that? Wafu Nan-nan something? Wafu Nannichuan! The Story of the Spring of Drowned Japanese Man Wafu Nannichuan! The Story of the Spring of Drowned Japanese Man. The Story of the Spring of Drowned Japanese Man A long, long time ago, in a place where foxes and humans lived together. A long, long time ago, in a place where foxes and humans lived together. This is like a picture story show! Nabiki-chan! The people had trouble dealing with these foxes and their bad habits. One day, a monk from China's Jusenkyo came. In order to get rid of the foxes, he uttered a chant. And when he chanted... ah, how mysterious, a spring popped up. When the foxes went into this spring, they turned into men! They thought then that the bad foxes would vanish. But the foxes that turned into men became even bigger hassles... and caused more problems for the people. Then there was no point in that spring. What would happen if the secret of this spring got out?! Every living thing would turn into a man! HOW scary! Right. That's why it's a secret. But even if someone found out, would anyone want to steal it? It's such a scary spring. He ignored you. Where is this spring? If I tell you, will you marry Akane and inherit this dojo? Yes, Father! He's not your father! Shut up! Don't get upset. Who would want this broken down dojo! Did you just say 'broken down'? If you don't want it, then don't inherit it! What?! Are you telling me you want me to remain a woman for the rest of my life? You know, your pretty attractive. Well, I do have way bigger boobs then she does. You're jealous, aren't you? Well, I guess that's to be expected. A man like me is way better looking than a woman like you. Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! It's like a magic trick. Ouch! Please don't think badly of Akane-chan. She's not that honest about her feelings, and she can be quite violent. Aren't you trying to back her up? But Akane-chan has sworn to protect this dojo. To Akane-chan, that dojo is like her mother. When she was little, our mother passed away. She tries to forget her loneliness and focus on her training. She grew up in that dojo. That's why... to Akane-chan, that dojo is very important. So please don't hate her. Even though you didn't know, Ranma-kun, you just stepped all over Akane-chan's feelings. Like I thought, you aren't good at backing people up, are you? Would you like to stay for dinner? It will be ready in six hours. Ah! Where is Soun-san? I wonder if there is a way to stick Akane and Ranma together? It's okay. We have the advantage with the legendary hot spring. Where is Wafu Nannichuan? It's at the Gansou martial alts dojo, were we used to train with our master Happosai. But now that's become Akane's school. Like I thought, it's at that school. This is just between me and you, but in the back yard of the school, there's a fox statue whose paw points in the direction of the hot spring. If you walk 100 steps, you should reach the hot spring. Keep this a secret from Ranma-kun, okay? Of course! Darn right! It really does exist! Nabiki, don't ever tell Ranma! Oh? Yeah. One bottle isn't enough. You! Excuse me! 10 bottles of wine over here! 10?! 10 bottles of wine over here! Yes! Coming right up! Yes! Coming right up! Nabiki-san, Morobis-sama is leaving soon. Roger. Note: Oji-sama, means uncle in this case. Oji-sama, enjoy! Such a determined young lady. Genma-san! Panda-chan! Someone get me some hot water! Let's change you back, okay? Sign: I think I'll stay a panda for a little while. Come again! Hey, Nabiki-san. Aw, you're a man again. Are my dad and Soun-san here? They're here talking about where Wafu Nan-whatever is. Oh... What?! Where, where is it?! Money! Where, where is it?! Money! Thirty thousand. Becoming a man forever is cheap at that price, right? Yeah, but I don't have any money. Well then, I'll put it on your tab. Furinkan High School. This is it. Sign: In the direction the fox statues paw points, walk 100 steps. ...93, 94, 95... 2F Men's changing room 1F Women's changing room. Sign: Women's changing room. Who the hell are you? Are you guys also after the legendary spring? Let go. What the hell are you guys doing?! That's dangerous! What do you think would happen if that sickle hit my head?! Idiot! What? A drag queen? Note: Kama can mean sickle or drag queen. What? A drag queen? Note: Kama can mean sickle or drag queen. Hey, wait! Saotome... fighting... stance! Pride... of the Fierce Tiger! Huh? Why isn't it working? Oh... Is someone there? Hey, what are you doing over there?! Not good! A guy in Chinese clothes got in your way? Wasn't it a girl? No. That was definitely a man. Is that so? Well, that proves it. The legendary spring is inside that changing room. Yes, Madam Kamanbell. A legendary spring that will turn... anyone into a man. I won't let... anyone else have it. Is Ranma still asleep? Ranma woke up, took a bath and went with Akane to school. School, what for? School, what for? Ugh, I don't feel good. Ugh, I don't feel good. Soun! Does Ranma-kun have any money? No, he doesn't. In that case, he hasn't learned where the spring is. Nabiki will only "bend" to money. I was making a pun on nabiku as Nabiki-san's name and as "bending" to money. Oh, you didn't have to explain that. Why are you following me to school? Um, public observation. Outsiders aren't allowed in school. I won't cause any trouble. You've already caused enough trouble! What's wrong? Are you still upset about the dojo? Listen here. Are you upset because my body is better than yours? Ouch! You really are a violent girl! Wouldn't it be better for you if you took a clip in the legendary spring as well? Same to you. Wouldn't it be better if you remain a girl your whole life? If you do, then I wouldn't mind being friends with you! I'm a guy! Hey! Here we go. I've learned how to deal with it. As long as I have hot water with me, it's easily fixed. You're completely a girl, aren't you? Good morning. Morning. Good morning. Morning. What are you doing? What are you doing? Over there! Good morning, Akane-kun. I finished up early for you. What are you doing? You've finally agreed to fight me. It's not fair to sneak attack. If I win, then you have to date me. Akane-san. Good luck. Taking pictures again! Ah, as you were. Ah Opening! Now, what will you do? Give up and fly into my arms. Or, lose and date me? Pick one of the two. Aren't they both the same thing? Now, don't be embarrassed. Fly into my arms! Want me to save you? Mind your own business. Okay. Then why not date this pervert? Pervert? Who the hell are you? When you talk to someone, it's best to introduce yourself first. Okay! I'll tell you my name. You're Kuno, right? I'm Ranma, Saotome Ranma. Ranma? Ranma? Wasn't that the girl we saw yesterday? Don't mess with me! That beautiful girl with the nice body... She can't be you! Well then, I guess you can call me Akane's fiancé. What? Stop that. But that's the only other way to describe me, right? You! Ah! Hey, you cut the strap! Stop whining like a girl! Girl? Don't fuss over a cut strap. That's so girly! What do you mean by "girly"? Well, I'll tell you. Girl-girl equals girly! You bastard! Being called a girl pisses me off the most! No excuses! You okay? Yeah. Behind you! Ah Opening! Naive. Please stop, Kuno-sempai. Well then, date me. Akane-san, take a look at this. There were a bunch of kicks. I couldn't see that at all. Kuno is no big deal. Saotome Ranma? How cool! Ranma, you're so cool! Oh, I am? I'm cool? Why are you acting so tough? Are you okay? Let's go to the infirmary. No need. What if the bone is broken? Come on. Let's go. The girl from yesterday? Suck it up. Tofu-sensei is the best bone doctor around. I was so shocked that I pressed too hard. Sorry about that. Hey! Anyone would be surprised, hearing that if you get splashed with water you turn into a girl. But there's a legendary spring that will turn him back into a man if he bathes in it. A legendary spring? Is it okay to be telling this to a teacher? Tofu-sensei is special. Special, huh? Got a problem? Nope! Don't spill water on me. Why do I have a guy-girl like him as a fiancé? Don't call me guy-girl! But it's true, isn't it? Akane-chan, it's not good to judge a person by their looks. He got you out of some trouble, didn't he? Did you thank him properly? Thank you for saving me. No problem. Ranma, go home, okay? Acting all high and mighty. Ranma-kun. Forget about the fiancé part. Please protect Akane-chan, okay? She doesn't need any protection. She's a strong girl. Akane-chan has a tendency to take on too much by herself. I, too, was in line to inherit my family's dojo near theirs, so I've known her for a long time. Oh, so that's how you also knew Kasumi. Hey, don't spill water on me. He was so cool, wasn't he? Oh, hey, Ranma is the same name as that girl from yesterday, right? Ah, that's just a fluke. Tell me. Is it true that he's your fiancé? He's so cool! That's the type you like? - Yep! - Yeah! He's hot! Let's have him beat up the pervert! Pervert? Yeah. Someone broke into the girls' locker room the other day. No way! Scary, right? Everyone! Sign: Sit down before the bell rings. Sign: Sit down before the bell rings I'm sure you've heard about the break-in the other clay. So for safety, I'm closing the girls' locker room. What?! You'll have to change here in the classroom. Sensei, if we change here, anyone could peek in and spy on us. That might be okay for you, because you're a man, but it's not for us. That's right! Vice Principal. Please let us use the locker room. We'll protect ourselves, okay? Please! That's why I hate women! How about we ask Ranma-kun to be a bodyguard? Yeah. If there is a pervert out there, I will beat him up! Hey, are you okay? Don't you know you had to say the password before coming in? I'm sorry, I completely forgot about it. Th-Thank you. Thanks. What are you up to? Ranma! What?! Ranma, were you the pervert? What?! Are you an idiot? There's no point in playing dumb. Looks like I have no choice. I really didn't want to use this move on you. If you want to move out of the way, now's your only chance. Like hell we'll move. With this move... I have enough power to defeat a tiger! Crouch... of the Wild Tiger! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Isn't that a kowtow? Did he just bow down? How uncool! Ranma! If you feel so wronged, then why don't you come try to catch me, idiots?! I can't believe that he was the pervert! I can't believe I liked him! He's the worst! Sign: Ranma. Sign: Ranma Stupid Ranma. Stupid Ranma. Stupid Ranma! Stupid Ranma. Stupid Ranma. Stupid Ranma! Sign: Ranma. I can't believe that guy is Akane's fiancé. It's unforgivable, right? Should I go and find his weakness? How low! Secretly using a person's weakness to defeat someone is cowardly. Sorry to bother you, then. Even if it's a weakness, as long as you aim for it fairly, then it's not cowardly at all. Sign: Furinkan High School. Sign: Furinkan High School Vice Principal, would you like to come and have a drink with us? Vice Principal, would you like to come and have a drink with us? Sorry, there are still things I must do. Am I the last one? Yes, you are. Sorry. Thank you. Good work. Then see you tomorrow. Goodbye. Where do you want to go? Oh, how about a movie? Ranma-kun isn't really a pervert, is he? But he dressed in drag and snuck into the girl's locker room! I feel embarrassed that I thought of him as a good guy, even for a moment. Why would he bother dressing up as a girl? What? If he just poured water on himself, he would've become a girl and not been discovered, right? Well, that's true... As I thought, let's believe in Ranma-kun, okay? How stupid are you? If you poured water over yourself, you would just have become a girl. It's not like I went there to spy on them. I have my pride, you know. Just to let you know... To cover your tab, I'm gonna make you throw away that pride of yours. Ugh, Okay! You're so cute. When I'm a girl, my strength is less, though. That doesn't matter right now. You know... I'll make a lot of money from using him. You aren't finished yet, you know. Where do you think you're going? I'm going to school. Hey, are you new here? Y-Yes! Sign: Have we met somewhere before? Sign: Have we met somewhere before? Nope. I've never seen you before in my life. Nope. I've never seen you before in my life. I've never seen you before in my life. Sign: Girls' Locker Room. Where is it?! This way;! It's so dark I can't tell! How much further? We're almost there! Signs: Wafu Nannichuan. This is it! I finally found it! Drag queens! Yes! Pardon me, Madam Kamanbell. Hurry up and let the water flow! But there isn't a switch to release the water! That can't be true! On, it is. Well then, boys, go and find one! Such an ugly-looking face! Well, everyone! Let's search for the handle! Yes! Go on! Hey, hey! Hurry! Hurry! - It's not here. - Find it! - Search! - Yes! Wouldn't it be better if we blew it up with dynamite? Wait. No way! I'm just a stranger! Sign: Who does she remind you of? Sign: Who does she remind you of? Papa! Leave her alone. Let's have a toast. Papa! Leave her alone. Let's have a toast. Okay. Cheers! Cheers. Nabiki-san, I can't take this anymore! It's okay! No way! It's fine! Oh Genma-san, if he does want to become a man again, he needs a key in order to get the water. Sign: A key? Sign: A key? Hey. Where is the key? Hey. Where is the key? Like I'd tell you. Sign: Tell me. Sign: Tell me. Cheap-skate. Sign: Tell me. I'll tell you later in secret. Oji-sama! Will you tell me in secret as well?! In secret? But this has nothing to do with you, right? Oh, but I really want to know your secret! Oji-sama's secret... Well, listen to this. I've hidden it in the safest spot in my house. Like a safe? Nothing like that. The truth is... I've hidden it here... like so, right here, pochi-chu! Nice punch! Here? But where? Ouch! All right! What! Wait, it's not what it looks like, um... I just wanted what was on your chest. No! I don't mean that! Well then, what do you mean?! You... pervert! How wild! Way to go, Ranma! It's not like that! Even though she's your fiancé, it's still not a good idea to sneak into her bed at night. It's good to see that you're healthy! Sign: Refill, please. How can you guys say that? Like I said, I didn't mean to do that! You're telling me that guy is the pigtailed girl?! I was surprised as well. Saotome Ranma is guy, but not really, and the pigtailed girl is a girl, but not really. In other words, the pigtailed girl's mind and body both belong to Ranma! What?! And... when he turns into a girl... he's... weaker. That bastard. Not only does he have Akane, but now he's going after some sweet pigtailed girl as well. What? And on top of that, around this girl he becomes weak? That's not it. I have proof. I won't forgive him! Akane! I see. When you pour hot water on yourself, you turn into a beast! So are you saying that if Tofu-sensei snuck into your room, it would have been okay? That's right, isn't it? But I'm afraid he likes Kasumi-san. With that long hair, you're just copying Kasumi-san, aren't you? You have some cute points, after all. Don't touch me, pervert! I'm not a pervert! The legendary spring is inside the girl's locker room, and that necklace of yours is the key. Where in the locker room might this spring be? Also... how can this be a key? I don't care if you don't believe me. Just lend me the necklace! Stop! Stop! Just lend it to me! Just lend it to me! - I said no! - Just lend it to me! - I said no! - Give it! Give it! Stop! Stop! Ranma! Ranma! Let go of her! Give that back, please. It's precious to me. Akane-kun. I'll invite you to eat lunch with me. More importantly, give me my necklace! I'll invite you to eat lunch with me. Oh, me too. I'll go! You don't get to come! Don't be so stingy! Only Akane-kun and the stylish pigtailed girl are invited! Your an idiot, aren't you?! All right, Akane-kun. I'll see you later. What are you gonna do about this?! If the pigtailed girl is allowed to go, then... Ranma? I'll tell her to come. You are not allowed to come! That's it? This is Kuno's place? He's the son of a millionaire who owns this high school. And on top of that, his father is the principal of the school. The principal? Yep, although he's away on vacation right now. More importantly, is that necklace really the key? If it wasn't, do you think I'd do something like this? Welcome. Wow. This is something. Huh? When did he take these? I really want to get out of here as soon as possible. Don't just stand there. Sit. We're preparing things now. What's wrong? Don't worry. It's not like I'm gonna eat you. Is that really true? Then, what the hell is this?! I thought that if you get tired, you might want to lie down. Both of you are so cute that I just can't pick one of you. My heart wants to date both of you. I won't deny it. That's why I've set up three pillows. This guy is seriously damaged. Just give me back my necklace. Calm down, Akane-kun. Please! Just give it back to her, Kuno! If I give it back, then she'll leave. Shut up. Just do it! I understand that you want me all to yourself... I understand that you want me all to yourself... - Like hell I do! You bastard! Like hell I do! You bastard! Ouch! Ow, ow! Like hell I do! You bastard! Give it back! Ouch, hot! Uh... Ranma! What? Where's the pigtailed girl? What the hell did you do, you ass?! Bastard! I'm taking my leave now! Akane-kun! Akane! Who are you? Hand over that necklace. You've shown up again, you drag queen bastards! What's wrong? You can't fight without your weapons? Pride- Pride- Akane-kun! Akane-kun! Akane! Are you okay? Are you hurt? Hey? How senseless are you? Do you think there's a girl who's okay with getting her hair cut off? Even though she isn't injured, she's lost her hair! Akane? I'm home. Akane-chan, dinner is almost ready- What happened to your hair? I just felt like changing the style. Can you make it even? You seem to have caused trouble for Akane-chan. I'm just interested in finding the legendary spring. Then marry her. That way, the legendary spring... As long as I have her necklace, then I can get to the spring. But I'm not the only one after it. What? Even though Soun thinks she's the safest place for the key, I don't think she should carry it around. Idiot. The reason he gave her the key is because he thinks she's the only one to inherit the dojo. Then why am I her fiancé? Because it might be too difficult for her to handle the dojo and the spring by herself. If you can't understand that reasoning, then you'll never become the strongest man! Bye-bye, Akane-chan. Feel better, okay? Sign: Ono Bone-setting Therapy. Sign: Ono Bone-setting Therapy Okay! Sign: Ono Bone-setting Therapy. Sign: Ono Bone-setting Therapy Sorry about my sister always causing trouble. Sign: Ono Bone-setting Therapy. Sign: Ono Bone-setting Therapy No problem. No problem. Akane-chan... you're a girl. You shouldn't fight with boys and make them cry. If you don't become more feminine, then Tofu-sensei won't like you anymore. Kasumi-san, um, your long hair is very pretty. Thank you very much. What is it? Um... Did you expect me to be crying? I was planning on cutting it soon anyways. But I feel sorry for you, having to kiss Kuno-sempai. I'll definitely kick his ass someday. It's no big deal, though. Unless it was your first kiss. No way. That was your first kiss? What's so funny?! Akane. You... saved me again. Thank you. Someone's after it? We don't know who they are, but someone else is after the legendary spring! Like I thought. Like you thought? Did you notice something? I'm having a friend of mine look into it now. A friend? I'm so sorry. Saotome Ranma got in our way again. That guy shouldn't have been there, should he? Only Tendo Akane and the pigtailed girl were invited. He suddenly appeared! As though the pigtailed girl transformed into him! Does that mean he's a drag queen as well? Madam Kamanbell. Akane-san. Good morning. Good morning. Kuno! What did you do to Akane-san? I didn't hurt her. Ranma did! The one who did this... was Saotome Ranma! That jerk. Ranma... Morning. Morning. What's with the new hair style? Did something happen? Nope. This is easier to deal with. Does it look weird? No, it looks good on you. Thanks. It's cute. Yeah, cute. Maybe I should cut my hair too... you think? It'd probably look good on you. Huh? It'd probably look good on you. It'd probably look good on you. Ranma! We won't forgive anyone who's hurt Akane-chan! Are you okay? Want us to take you to the nurse? I'm fine. I can go by myself. It's not like I wanted to hurt Akane. Do you think that excuse would work?! Tonight. A duel for Akane, to see who gets her. Let's settle this once and for all. I won't let you say that you have nothing to do with her! Yesterday you were attacked by strange men? I don't know who they were, but they threw a sickle at me. However, Ranma saved me. Is that so? Well, I'm glad you're all right. It's a light sprain. It will heal in two to three days. Um, Sensei... Yes? How do I look? You look very cute. Really? Yeah. It reminds me of your tomboyish side. Ah, right. That's more like the Akane-chan I know. Isn't it! I thought that as well. W-Would you... thank Kasumi-san for me? Tell her that her sweets were tasty. Sure. What are you doing up there? Sensei told you that you're cute. Isn't that great? It doesn't matter anymore. Of course it matters. Tofu-sensei has liked Kasumi ever since I was little. I'm okay now. What are you doing? It's creepy. You're so not cute! Come on! I'm not in the mood to have a guy carry me right now. You... work too hard by yourself. What are you doing? If I'm a girl, it's okay, right? I thought you hated turning into a girl? Well, it's true that I have always wanted to be a strong man. I've been training since I was little. And when I turn into a girl, I become weak. Are you saying women are weak? Don't get mad! Well, isn't it all about a person's feelings? If you're really strong, then it doesn't matter if you're a guy or girl. The me of yesterday would have said that... But in reality women are weaker. That's why I can't inherit the dojo alone. If your dad didn't want you to inherit the dojo, then he wouldn't have given you the key to the spring. Soun only made me your fiancé because he didn't want you to handle everything on your own. But... my mother gave me this, not my father. When she was hospitalized, she gave it to me. Well then, I guess you inherit her duties. Have more confidence in yourself. So... don't work too hard... by yourself. Tofu-sensei said that before, right? I also think that hair style looks good on you! Even though I don't think you'll be happy to hear that from me. With short hair, I definitely like you! L-Li... Hop on. Hurry! Well... I guess you don't care what type of girl I like though. Onee-chan? Are you hungry? It will be ready in four hours. Tofu-sensei asked me to tell you that the sweets were tasty and that you should bring more. I'm glad. I wonder what I should make him this time? I think I'll use "that" box this time, right? That's right. Oji-sama? It seems my idiot son has been causing you trouble these days. That's not true. But... ever since he came here, he's been more cheerful. I bet he turned out the way he is now because of how he was raised. Um... what about Ranma's mother? Has he told you anything? Nothing at all. I bet. When he was little, she passed away. "I will become the strongest man." That's what he'd always tell his mother. Even if that's not possible, his mother would be proud if he had a family of his own... and become a proper man. Oji-sama. Oh... Sorry for saying all this. Cheers! Wow, great job. Now Akane will feel sorry for Ranma and become... Sign: Ranma + Akane -> Love Wow, great job. Now Akane will feel sorry for Ranma and become... Sign: Ranma + Akane -> Love. Sign: Ranma + Akane -> Love That's right. That's right. That's terrible! What? Ranma's mom is perfectly fine, right?! Huh? Sign: But we really haven't seen her in a long time. Sign: But we really haven't seen her in a long time. It's just that they don't get along, right? It's just that they don't get along, right? Genma-san! Ouch! That really hurt! Pride... of the Fierce Tiger! Pride... of the Fierce Tiger! Ranma. Here! I'll lend it to you. You want to become the strongest man in the world, right? Is that really okay? You also work too hard all by yourself. I think we are quite alike. Don't you agree? What a bother. Here. Hey, Akane-chan. I guess I've become a hostage? Soun-san! Oh, Tofu-sensei? How unusual. Do you come to places like this, too? Ah... No! Are you Ranma's father? Sign: Who's this? Akane's teacher. He's like us, a martial artist of the Anything Goes school. No way? Sign: Is he helping us? No way? Sign: Is he helping us? Sign: Is he helping us? Yes. I asked him to work at the school and guard the legendary spring. Yes. I asked him to work at the school and guard the legendary spring. Soun-san... I figured out who's after the hot spring. What are you doing?! Do you think you can do this and get away with it?! As usual, you're so assertive! Oh, you two. Sign: ABC. Sign: ABC Vice Principal? Sign: ABC. The VP job is just a cover up. This is my true form! Vice Principal... Where would you find a vice principal as extraordinary as me?! I am... ...Madam Kamanbell. So you're saying he disguised himself as the vice principal? Sorry, I was completely fooled. But isn't the vice principle a man? "Madam" means he should be a woman, right? Could it be that he's... a drag queen? No, it's more like this. Oh, this way. That doesn't matter. Both mean the same thing! It turns out Madam Kamanbell, who controls over every drag queen in the nation, is the boss of an organization that influences political and business circles, educational institutions, and mass media. But why would they go after the legendary spring? A world full of beautiful men? That's right. I want to use the spring and change all the women in the world into men! Then I will finally have my dream world! Yes, Madam Kamanbell. Disgusting! Shut up! Give that back! You jerk. I'm gonna kick your ass. So you don't care what happens to this woman? Take her along as a hostage. If you want one, take me instead. I don't wanna! You'll just resist! I won't! I don't care what happens to me, but... if you lay a hand on this family, I won't forgive you even if I'm dead. Ranma. Anyway... bring her along. I told you to stop! I'll go. Let my sister go. You idiot, I'll go! Just to let you know, even if you have the key, you won't be able to open the spring without me. Don't lie to me! If you think it's a lie, then go on ahead and try it! We'll take Tendo Akane with us! Stop. I told you to stop! Akane! My mother gave me that key. It's as precious to me as this dojo. I know all that! It's very precious to me! Akane-chan. Akane! It's okay. I take after my mother, right? Akane! Akane! Where are you, Akane! Oh, Ranma-kun! Kasumi! They took Akane! What? We came too late for Akane?! Are you okay, Kasumi-san?! Hurry! We have to save Akane-chan! Okay, let's gather all the Anything Goes Martial Arts practitioners in the area. We don't have time for that! Sign: Wait? Where's Ranma? It's very precious to me! You... saved me again. You want to become the strongest man in the world, right? You work too hard all by yourself. This is the legendary spring? That's right, now open it up for me. Want me to save you? You... work too hard all by yourself. Have more confidence in yourself. I guess we are quite alike. Don't you agree? What are you waiting for?! Open it Up! Ranma. Akane! Madam Kamanbell. Ranma is here? Take care of him. Yes, ma'am. What's the meaning of this?! I'll protect this hot spring. I won't hand it over to you! That's why I hate women. Especially women who act manly! It doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman. What matters is your desire to protect what's precious to you! The only one allowed to use this spring... is Ranma! Give me back Akane! I won't hold back on those who get in my way! Hold it, Ranma! I was wondering why you had me waiting for so long. What happened to our duel? Idiot! I don't have time to deal with you! No excuses! If you want to fight me, defeat all these guys first! Huh? I don't know who you guys are... but I'll be the one... to defeat Ranma. I will definitely protect this spring! You foolish girl! I don't have time to play with you! Don't get in my way! Tofu-sensei? Though it might not seem like it, I learned my finger massage from Anything Goes Martial Arts. Are you serious? Soun-san? Ranma-kun, where is Akane? Can you handle these guys? Yeah. It's going to be a bit hard. It might not be the right time for this, but it seems you've fallen in love with my daughter Kasumi, Doctor. Aaaah... How many are you?! That won't open unless I do it. It worked! Like I thought! Sign: Hold it right there! Dad? Big... thing? Run with? Are you saying it was fun? No clue what you're saying, but I'll let you handle them! Akane! Akane! Ranma! What a handsome woman you make! But, I heard that when you become a woman, you get weaker. How about this? If you join us, then I'll make you a man forever! I'm not a drag queen! Don't get cocky with me! The hot spring? Is it the real deal? I was just about to test it with this girl! Akane! Damn! I... want to become the strongest man in the world! If you became a man, then your wish might come true. That's not what I mean! When it comes to strength, it doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman! If you're protecting something important, even a woman can become stong. Isn't that right, Akane?! Right. Akane... Give me back Akane! Ranma! Ouch. It's impossible to win as girl! Shut up! I already decided that I'd protect you! This is why I hate women. I'll let you have the hot spring. Please stop. I don't wanna! Don't give it to this creep! The final blow! Out of the way! I won't move! Ranma... is my fiancé! It must be rough... having a girly-guy like him as your fiancé. He's such a girly-girl. He's right! Are you really a guy? Like I thought, you're really useless as a girl! Tell him off some more. You're even worse... than a woman! More! You don't even have the right to be a man! More! You'd even lose to a drag queen! More! You should just stay... a girl the rest of your life! I'm a man. I'm... a man! Shut up! I will... Shut up! I will... Shut up! I will... Shut up! Ranma! I will protect Akane! Ranma... Madam Kamanbell! We're sorry! We won't do this again! Akane. I knew you'd come. Wasn't that obvious? Thank you. Ranma! You've turned back into a man. All right! Akane, let's go! It's too late... the water already hit me. Let's get going! It's useless... We still don't know that! I do know! Because you've changed back into a man. Soon I will, too. There's nothing I can do now. Plus, even when I was little, everyone said I was a tomboy. You said it too, right? But... if this is gonna happen... then as a woman... my last wish as a woman would be... Thank you for your continued business, but Wafu Nannichuan... has been shut down. This is just an ordinary hot springs. I haven't changed! Does that mean the water doesn't work anymore? Are you serious?! Sign: What were you two doing earlier? You should come to our house sometime. I'll let Kasumi know. I'll gladly come! Where did Ranma go?! Ranma... let go! Where is Ranma?! Ah! Kuno-sempai?! Kuno-san! I'm in trouble! I'm in big trouble here! Tendo Soun Akane, Kasumi Saotonqe Gennqa, Ranma. It was just hot water. Hey. Nabiki-chan. It's not like Father meant for this to happen. Also, it's not like he shamed the family or anything. Thank you. Wait, shamed the family? Shamed... Hey, Oji-sama... Hm? How'd you like to work here? Tamayama Zoo? Do you mean doing something like taking care of the animals? Nope. You'll make me a lot of money doing this! Genma-san! Panda-san! Wait, my panda! I thought there was no reason for you to come to school anymore? Idiot! Maybe if I start digging around there, I might find the legendary spring somewhere. You still haven't given up on that? Hey, do you plan on sneaking into the girls' locker room again? I have no interest in seeing you naked! What do you mean?! Like I thought. Wouldn't it be better if you really were born a guy? Same to you. Wouldn't it be better if you stayed a girl? Shut up. Hey! Give that back! Original Subtitles by LuffyNoTomo Original timing, typesetting by zdzdz. Editing, retiming by Collectr. QC by CP Retiming, additional translation and editing by Ericf
