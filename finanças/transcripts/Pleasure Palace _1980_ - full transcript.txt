(ITC theme music) (murmurs of a crowd) - [Voiceover] Many come to Baden-Baden to take the beneficial waters and it turn have taken themselves at the baccarat chemin de fer table. A simple game, chemin de fer, much like American blackjack, but with the highest card and the winning total, nine, and all the 10s and pretty pictures worthless. A simply game where fortunes can be won or lost, but the game that is also an art when it's practiced by Louie Lefevre, gambler... Sportsman... Lover... Connoisseur; but, not necessarily in that order. - Banco. - [Voiceover] (foreign language) Cards, please. (foreign language) Cards for the bank. Counting cards. (foreign language) The bank shows five. - Nine. - (foreign language) - Everything, please. Everything stays. - [Voiceover] (foreign language) (upbeat, groovy jazz) - Nine. - (foreign language) - We can have it. What makes you want to pay half a million for a picture that belongs in a comic book? - [Louie] That's what you said when we bought the Picasso. - Very well, which do you want, this or the Ferrari? - Both. (car honk) (casino chatter) (foreign language) - [Voiceover] No more bets. All bets are closed. - Card, please. - How much is Lefevre down tonight? - 100,000. - (foreign language) Place your bets. - [Voiceover] Do we have a bet, gentlemen? - Yeah, I'm betting. - [Voiceover] We have a bet of 18,000 pounds. Mr. Lefevre? - Banco. - [Voiceover] Cards? - Card, please. - [Voiceover] A third card for Mr. Lefevre. - Nine. - [Voiceover] Nine, Mr. Lefevre wins. - Thank you. 25,000. - We have a bet of 25,000 pounds. - I'ma cover that bet. Banco! - [Voiceover] Cards, please. - Give me one of them cards. - [Voiceover] A third card for Mr. Howland. A natural eight, Mr. Lefevre wins. (chips clanging across the table) (bell chime) - [Voiceover] Thank you, ladies and gentleman, we've concluded for the evening, the table is closed. - Oh, you're closing just because we're losing? - [Voiceover] Well, thank you, Mr. Lefevre. - How marvelous, he tipped him over a 1000 pounds. - It is no big thing to be generous with what you have taken from others! - Shall we see the cashier, Pokey? Take care of it, please. - You! Ah! (crowd murmurs) - A severed nerve has been known to paralyze a man. - You win too much and too often. There is a name for a man like you among my people and we know how to deal with him. - Your manners, as well as your game, could stand improvement, my friend. (crowd murmurs) (smooth jazz) - That was marvelous. You handled that contemptible worm beautifully. - I'm sorry you had to witness such an unpleasant incident. - Well, I'm not. He had it coming. Won't you join me, Mr. Lefevre? - Only if you promise that you won't vanish again. - You have my word. - Thank you. Flesh and blood, definitely. - (giggle) What'd you aspect? - A wraith, an apparition. You appear and you disappear. How do you know my name? - Doesn't everyone? Cognac is what you prefer at this hour, isn't it? - (laugh) Yes, how'd you know that? - I've been following you. Baden-baden, Macau, Monte Carlo, and now London. - I'm very flattered. - It's not what you think. - Oh, what a pity. - (laugh) If that's a compliment, thank you. Incidentally, I'm Madelaine Calvert. - Of Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas? - Mhm. - I admired your late husband very much. We played together many times before he assumed control of the hotel. - Well, now I've taken his place. - [Louie] Congratulations. - I suppose you want to know why I've been following you? - Let's say, I'm intrigued. - [Madelaine] Research. - Research? - Well, after all, you're probably the world's most celebrated gambler and I wanted to learn what it would take to attract a man of your caliber to the casino. - And, did you discover anything from your observation? - A lot... Among other things, wherever you go the big money follows. Everybody seems to be determined to prove that the fabled Louie Lefevre is only human and can be beaten. - (laugh) Like the gun-fighters in your Old West when the fastest gun was always challenged, my life is one shootout after another; but at the chemin de fer table instead of the O.K. Corral. - I never thought of it that way (giggle). You're not annoyed that I've been following you, then? - Why don't we discuss it over dinner? - I'd be delighted. - Tomorrow evening? - What about a week from tomorrow? Caesar's Palace? - You want me to come to Las Vegas? - Well, as my guest. You see, I have a problem, a rather serious problem and I think you can be of help. - What kind of problem? - I'd rather discuss it in Vegas... Will you come? - (laugh) Yes. But, I would except your invitation if it were for no other reason than to enjoy your company. - Now, I'm flattered. And, most men, at least the ones I've met recently, seem to think that I'm over the hill. - (chuckle) I challenge that. However, let me tell you that I've always been intrigued by what may lie on the other side of the hill. - I'll drink to that. (glasses clink) (jet engine) - Well? - In a minute, I'm not a computer. Okay, you want to raise that Ferrari? I think we can do it without paying. - Good. - On the other hand, we could use that money to buy that chateau near Bordeaux, the one with the small vineyard I told you about. - Unless we're going into the wine business, what do we need it for? How often would we be there? - Still, it would be nice to have our own place, a real home. Be the host for a change. You could entertain a woman, I would entertain a woman. - (laugh) Since when is there a lack of women in my life or yours? - But a house, a piece of land, also it would be security for our old age. - You think like a peasant. - Forget it. - I already have. - [Voiceover] Chicago to our left, ladies and gentleman. We're on schedule and should be landing in Las Vegas in three hours and five minutes. - Who asked him? - What's a matter with you? - Well, it's really crazy, you know? Flying several thousand miles so you can have dinner with a woman who is old enough to be your wife. - I can see you're going to be very good company. - Next time, buy one ticket. (smooth jazz) - [Voiceover] You sure you don't think it's dumb, sugar, I mean, my wearing all these diamonds and rubies with my jeans? - Baby, the way those pants fit, nobody's gonna get around to noticing anything else (laughs) You know what I'm gon' do? I'm gonna change it's name, Ms. Bobby, the Yellow Rose of Texas. - (laughs) Alright, let's go! - Watch your head now, honey. I'll watch from here. (laughs) (smooth jazz) (jet engine) (ring) - Yes. - They're just taking off now. She's wearing the stuff right out in the open like it was paste. - The necklace too? - The works, the ball's in your court now. - Fine, if I need anything I'll be in touch with you. (jet engine) - Now, listen, I can fertilize half of Texas with the blow you've been handing me. I'm putting you on short notice, you've got 24 hours to sow up those off-shore rights or you're gonna be back pumping gas instead of drilling for it. Hey, fellas, what'd say to a drink? You know, you like pretty uptight, might calm your nerves. - No, thank you. - Well, how about a bowl of chili? We got a galley full of the best homemade chili this side the panhandle. - Mr. Howland, we have many important matters to discuss. - I wish you fellas would learn how to relax. - Mrs. Calvert is a very stubborn woman. She has refused our offer and it was a good one. - A stubborn woman is like a camel, it must be beaten to bring it to its knees. - (gasp) Read somewhere that a camel just'll leave spit in your eyes lookin' at you. - In my country, women do not interfere in the affairs of men. - In this country, women have affairs too (laugh). Gonna change, sweetie; don't wanna walk in looking like I just got back from the Calgary Stampede. - Anything you say, sweet thing. Eat your hearts out, fellas. (jet engine) (funky jazz) - Okay, come on, he's here, look alive! - [Voiceover] Get the baggage out of that car over there, the Pontiac, please. - Benny Marfo, Casino manager, welcome to Caesar's Palace, Mr. Lefevre. - Thank you. Andre Poquette. - How do ya do? - [Andre] Valet. - My associate... - Valet. - I've got a luxury suite for you Mr. Lefevre, one of our best. - That's very kind of you. - Mrs. Calvert says she's looking forward to having dinner with you, but, rest up first, take your time. - Thank you. (funky jazz) - Where'd you put Mr. Lefevre, Benny? - New tower, fantasy suite. The other one I put down the hall. - What about our friends from Texas? - Those creeps just landed. - Those creeps happen to represent one of the most powerful conglomerates in the world. - All I know is they're trying to push you out, those stockholders got rocks in their heads. The least they could do is give you time to take hold. - Well, we're not finished yet. - You got a plan? - Yeah, I got a plan. Now, would you mind going downstairs and greeting the enemy? - Who needs to welcome enemies? - Please? - Okay... For you. - Thanks, Benny. Thanks for caring so much, I don't know what I'd do without you. I know what you did for my husband to and I'm grateful. - That's okay. (orchestral smooth jazz) (casino crowd chatter) - I hate this place. A casino that has machines with lights is not for a man with your reputation. - You're a snob. (upbeat jazz) - Okay, they're here. Be polite, you don't have to look happy to see them. I'm Benny Marfo, Casino Manager. Mrs. Calvert says welcome to the hotel. - Aye, Benny, hi. What a spread you've got yourself, here. And, keep an eye on that luggage there, would ya, Detrick? Aye, what'd ya think of it, honey? - Oh, it's great! - [Voiceover] Your key, miss? - Thank you. - Do you know they actually have two dollar black jack tables, here? - (snicker) So, when we first met, we didn't have two dollars between us; so stop carrying on, have a good dinner, see a show, maybe you'll find a beautiful woman to keep you company. - The dinner will be rotten, the show will be rotten, and if there is a beautiful woman here, you will find her first. All together, this is going to be one rotten weekend. Hello... I've changed my mind, I don't think it's going to be such a rotten weekend after all. - I'll check on our accommodations. - We better keep an eye on the bodyguard. I don't think he was too happy with what you did to his boss. What? - Have you ever seen such a beautiful woman? - I know her from somewhere. - You go where I go and I would never forget such a woman. - I tell you, I have seen her before. - Mr. Marfo will be up right after he gets the other's settled. - We'll settle in like it was our second home. (giggles) - [Voiceover] Oh, honey, this place is dreamy. I can't wait to get out and play (giggles) - [Voiceover] My bet's gonna be on you, sugar. (laughs) Thank you, son. - I think I'll play a few hands. - Chemin de fer? - No, just blackjack until Mrs. Calvert comes down. - Mrs. Calvert? (chuckle) Things must be serious, other wise you'd be on a first-name basis. - Louie! - Hey, Alan. How are you? - Well... Pokey! - [Pokey] Hello, Alan. - What are you guys doing in Las Vegas. - I'm just trying our luck a little. - Watch out for him; I gotta run, I got my horse double-parked. (laughs) - Good evening Mr. Lefevre. - Good evening. - I'd recognize you anywhere. - Thank you. Give me four thousand, please. - Change, four thousand. - Excuse me folks, give us a little space here so the gentleman can play, would ya please? - It's him I tell you, Dave and I saw him on our cruise. - Too many. - A limit, Mr. Marfo? - Not for you, Mr. Lefevre. - [Louie] Thank you. - Insurance, Mr. Lefevre? - Not even on my life. - Too many. - Dinner, Mr. Lefevre? - Thank you. Cash these in, Pokey, please. Come a long way for dinner. I'm very hungry. (smooth jazz) - Shall I have dinner served now, Mrs. Calvert? - Not yet. Thanks, Michael. - [Louie] What should we drink to this time? - How 'bout the truth? - [Louie] (snicker) Isn't that a dangerous way to start a relationship? - There's a good chance the truth may make you angry. - Well, I won't know until I hear it. - I had an ulterior motive when inviting you. - That makes us even, so did I; yours first. - I have a problem, as I told you in London, unfortunately it's not a romantic problem... It's a money problem. I may lose Caesar's Palace. - Money? Everything here, it is a palace; Kubla Khan would be green with envy. - Kubla Khan didn't have my labor cost. See, when my husband died, I initiated an expansion program; but, building cost tripled and I just kept pouring more and more money into everything. That's what's known in financial circles as over-extending. And, the banks are getting itchy. - And, there's no way out? - One, there's a conglomerate that wants to buy the hotel. You met them in London, Mr. Howland and his group; Mr. Ito and Mr. Hussein, the one with the bad arm. - So, that's why they're here. I thought they were after me. Madelaine, how can I possibly help you? - I want you to run the hotel and the casino too. - You're offering me a job? - Well, I hardly call a four-hundred-million dollar enterprise just a job. - But, I'm the worst person in the world to run a casino. I've spent the best part of my life trying to put them out of business. - Well, that's the whole point. You're the best in the world in what you do. You'd attract the high-roller's and the important gamblers, that's what I need right now. My stockholders would think twice about selling if they knew you were running the show. Will ya take it? You can name your price. - I wish I could help, really. - You're turning me down? - I'm sorry. - Will you at least think about it for a day or two? - Why is the hotel so important? There are other things in life. - I don't like those. - (chuckle) Well, that's something I can understand. - You forgive my ulterior motive? - Only if you forgive mine. - I'd have to be out of my mind. (clink of two glasses) - Okay, this is a duty roster. Freedman, Wolfe, Dixon, you've got the first shift. I've got a hunch this is gonna be a very rough weekend. Mrs. Howland will be wearing two million in jewels. - That's just asking for trouble. - [Voiceover] It's a free country. - Yeah, I know but it's a headache to us. - Keep your eyes open. The boss has enough on her mind, she doesn't need a jewel theft on top of it. - What about the Howland suite? - [Voiceover] Wired to the teeth. - Okay, suppose Mrs. Howland is in the casino and decides to go to the powder room? - Covered. We've got a new attendant. Okay, let's get going. - A job, here? - To manage the hotel and casino. - You're not going to do it, of course. - You should know better than to even ask. - Well, I suppose a man who is capable of paying half a million dollars for a picture even a monkey could paint, is capable of anything. - If I left it to you, we would own the world's largest collections of calendars. (sigh) - Twenty-five cent slots. - The challenge is to play and win regardless of the payoff. (groan) Are you going to be a grouch all weekend? - My disposition will improve when you finally play our three friends and take them to the cleaners. - Okay, I'll be right there. - Amuse yourself for a while. - We traveled several thousand miles so you can have dinner with a lady and already you've lost interest in her? - I haven't lost interest, Mrs. Calvert has other things on her mind at the moment. - Find out where I could know her from! - Double down, the odds are with you. A beautiful woman must always win. - Thank you. - [Voiceover] 19... 22. Thank you. - Thank you. (laughs) - One should never interfere with another player, but in this case, I found it impossible to resist. - Well, I'm glad that you didn't. I won and I'm grateful, thank you. - Would your gratitude extend to a little late supper? - Yes, I think it would. I'd like that. - I'd appreciate if you could get the stockholders to hang on just a little longer. There are a number of possibilities I'm exploring, I just need a little more time. Please do what you can. Thank you, g'night. They're lawyered, Benny. Stockholders have formed a block. - That'll hurt. - (chuckle) It won't help. If they sell to the conglomerate, they'll own 49% and they'll be my partners. - Some partners... The accountants will wind up running the place. - And, that's the least of it. They'll just wait until the bank's closed and then I'll be forced to sell out. - Said you had a plan? - I asked Louie Lefevre to take over the management. - That could do it, he'd bring in all the big boys, we'd be off and running. - And, don't start celebrating, Benny... He turned me down. - You're kidding. - I haven't given up yet. There's no love lost between Lefevre and that Howland bunch, maybe I can still persuade him. - If anybody can do it, you can. - Howland's asked for a meeting tomorrow. I'd like to keep it informal, lunch here. Did you extend the invitation? - What I'd like to do is invite them all to get lost, but I will. Do you also want me to invite Mr. Lefevre? - No, no... Now, he may be the only ace I hold. Is he still in the casino? - Palace Court having supper. - Good. Let's hope he stays too busy to play. - (chuckle) Why? - We can't afford it. (smooth orchestral music) (dramatic music) (heeled shoes clicking against the ground) - Howland, Howland, Howland. (break-switches flicking on and off) Wired. (unzip) (metal clanging against metal) (dramatic music intensifies) Oh! (thud) (cheerful orchestral music) Suites wired, I checked the system myself, it's impossible to get by it. If there's gonna be any action it'll be in the casino and the hotel security sticks to her like glue. They're supposed to leave sometime after midnight and if everything goes okay, I'll be on my way to Buenos Aires tomorrow morning. Okay, bye. (ring) - Go back to sleep, I'll answer it. - I've got it. Yes? - Good morning, not too early for you, I hope? Fine, I was wondering if you'd like to play some tennis before it gets too hot. Perhaps we could have breakfast after? - Well, that sounds like a good idea. - Okay, see you on the court. Bye. - Madelaine, Mrs. Calvert, she wants me to play tennis with her and then have some breakfast. - At this hour? You should have let me answer the phone. - I think I need the exercise. - I just saw your brunette in the elevator. - She's not my brunette, she's just a beautiful woman. She also has wit and intelligence. - Did you find out where I could know her from? - You don't know her. Perhaps you saw her photo in a magazine. She works as a mother sometimes for some other better couturist. - Sure... I'll go turn on your shower. - I can turn on my own shower and stop picking up after me, and stop telling people you're my valet. - I like to see you get mad. - I never get mad. - Sure, I'll go turn on your shower. - I said, no! - You see, you never get mad. - [Voiceover] Telephone call for Mr. Howland. Phone call for Mr. Howland. Mr. Morris, there's a party waiting for you at the front desk, Mr. Morris. - Well, that's the way it's gon be. If you don't like yet, you're gon wind up the way you started... In a house with no roof and a dirt floor. Hey, sweet thing, how ya doing there? (laughs) - [Voiceover] Telephone call for Mr. Bob Wessler. Mr. Bob Wessler, please pick up a red courtesy phone. - [Voiceover] Hello. - Hello. May I have a table in the shade? - Follow me. Enjoy your meal. - [Voiceover] Thank you. - [Voiceover] You're welcome. - Hi! - Hi. - I love your caftan. - Thank you. - Did you buy it here? - Morocco. - No kidding... That's where the casbah is, right? - No, that's Algiers, but you're close. - (laugh) That's a good thing you told me. If I ever get to Morocco, I'd go out of mind looking for the casbah (giggles). You waiting on someone? - No, why? - Would you like to have breakfast with me? I hate eating alone. - So do I. - I'm Bobby Howland. - Patti Flynn. - My honey's over there talking business and those creeps he's with just drive me up the wall. One beats camels and the other one helps him. (giggles) You sure you don't think I'm being pushy? I mean, asking ya over and all? - No, I like meeting new people. - So do I. See, I'm trying to improve myself and you can learn a lot meeting new people. - Improve yourself? - So I won't embarrass my husband. See, he likes to act like a good ole boy, but, he graduated from Harvard. I never even finished high school. - How long have you been married. - Exactly five days today. We met while I was waiting tables at a diner near his ranch. (laugh) It's hot enough to melt the fillings in your teeth. (nervous laugh) He stopped in to cool off and wham! It was just like the fourth of July for both of us! - Well, you've hardly had time to get to know each other. - Oh, heck. I know rockets and pinwheels when I see 'em. Oh, this is my wedding present. I know it's kind of tacky to wear it with everything but... Well, but I love it. - Do you think you should? - [Voiceover] Telephone call for Mr. Howland. - Well, it's insured and the hotel guards watch me. Listen, y'all doing anything special after breakfast? - Not really. - Well, my honey's gonna be tied up with those creeps all morning, so I'm going shopping. There's some real dreamy shops by the hotel. Would you like to go with me? - I'd love to. - (gasp) Terrific! - More coffee? - No, thank you. Do you mind if I smoke? - No, not at all. You said you were raised in Algiers? - It was my home until I was 17. My mother was English, a school teacher on holiday when she met my father. She never went back to England. - And, your father? - French Algerian. What used to be called a soldier of fortune. - (snicker) Sounds like a Humphrey Bogart film. - Our life, my mother's and mine, was not like a film. My father was involved with the Algerian freedom fighters. He was killed when I was eight, we were left destitute. - Why didn't your mother take you back to England, to her family? - Her family never accepted the marriage. She was unwilling to expose me to that prejudice. - The ring you wear on your chain? - That was mother's, she gave it to me before she died. It's my luck. - What made you become a gambler? - Necessity. I learned very early that I could provide for my mother by gambling on the streets of Algiers. Seems I have a talent for it. - Obviously. You want to take a walk around the terrace? It's a pretty view of Vegas. How did you meet Poquette? - Oh, we met during the war in Indo-China. He endangered himself to save me, I returned the favor and we consider ourselves like brothers now. - (snicker) He told Benny he was your valet. (laughs) Well, that's a game he plays because he knows it infuriates me. Now, we each do what we do best. I gamble and sees to our business affairs. Listen, I've been thinking about your problem. - I was hoping you were. - I know you said you didn't like losing, but, under the circumstances wouldn't it be better to just extricate yourself? - I can't... Know there are over three thousand people who make their living here from Caesar's Palace. They were very loyal to my husband and they've been very loyal to me. If I leave here... There's a good chance they'll lose their jobs. - It's a hotel casino, it must be staffed no matter who owns it. - Well, you know new owners like to bring in their own people. - Am I keeping you from something? - My lawyers, I have an appointment with them. They're probably waiting for me now. - I'll walk you down to the casino. - You know, I don't know what your plans are for the rest of the day, but we keep a boat at Lake Mead; you're more than welcome to use it. - Thank you, I may. I've never seen the dam, I hear it's spectacular. - It is. (casino chatter) - Benny. - Hey, come on! Come on! Oh, jackpot! (coins tumble) I hit the jackpot! - How much? - [Voiceover] 10 bucks! - Congratulation. - Thanks, but what one of these days I'm gonna play that Rainbow Progression and I'm gonna win me 250,000 smackers! - I wish you luck. A dedicated gambler but also an athlete, I noticed she was wearing tennis shoes. - Ah, cherries! (jazz ensemble) - You almost lost this. - (gasp) Oh, thank you! I'd die if I lost it. - [Patti] Here ya go, okay. - (sigh) Thank you. Okay... So... What do ya think? Wait. Right... I look like Eskimo, except I'm wearing the igloo. (laughs) - Are you going to see that brunette of yours this afternoon? - Look, I told you not to call her my brunette and I haven't decided yet whether I'm going to see her or not. - Why? Has something happened? - (sigh) Yes and no. - What do you mean yes and no? Yesterday you were in a trance over her. - I have a problem. I have never before been attracted to two women at the same time; and, I find it impossible to treat either of them casually. (back slaps) - Ah! Stop! If you want to kill someone, kill him. It'll solve his problem. (chuckle) Have you decided where we're going after Las Vegas? - No. - We have an invitation through that plantation in the Bahamas. The gaming's not bad in the Bahamas. - Look, I told you I haven't decided. - Maybe we should go back to London. The Arabs are still pouring in everyday and who will mind if you relieve them a little of their oil money. - No one including me. Did you send that cable off to the Ferrari people? - Not yet. - Why not? - Well, I thought you might want to think a little more about that chateau near Bordeaux, the one with the vineyard. - What is it with you and that chateau? - Nothing's with me. I'll send the cable to the Ferrari people. (back slaps) Ah! - [Voiceover] What are you doing? Wait a minute, wait a minute, I don't want to go in! Stop, stop, wait a minute! Oh, no! (scream) (splashing water) (smooth jazz) (dramatic ensemble) - Front entrance and straight out. (dramatic ensemble) Come on. Never, never try that again, Harry. - I should've figured you'd show up. Those rocks are worth a couple million easy. - You're on my turf, Harry. Now, you're going to get on a plane and you're going to fly away home. You drive. - You sure got yourself some other kind of view here, Mrs. Calvert. - It's even more spectacular in the winter when there's snow on the mountains. - How 'bout that. Well, I guess we might as well get down to business. - I don't know what there is to discuss. I thought I made it perfectly clear, Caesar's Palace is not for sale. - (chuckle) You know that there's one thing I hate to do, and that's argue with a lady. - (snicker) And, this lady holds the controlling stock. - It would be wise to accept our offer. - How dull life would be if we all did the wise thing. - You know Mrs. Calvert, we didn't come here with the straw hanging out of our hair. We've done our homework and we know the score. You're stockholders are steaming at you to sell. - You're perfectly free to buy their stock, course the gaming commission would have to approve the sale. - We are a legal operation. - Oh, then there should be no problem, should there? Go ahead and buy the stock. - Whoa, whoa, now wait a minute. Now, what we buy, we control, and we attend to acquire Caesar's Palace just as we've acquired casinos in Baden-Baden, London, and Macau. - You're not adding Caesar's Palace to your collection. - We'll just have to lay it on the line then, if we can't buy it, we'll win it. - And, just how do you intend to do that? - Oh, we can outlast the house, the game, and tables and you know it. We have the ammunition, unlimited resources. Sooner or later, we gonna break you. - We have done it elsewhere Mrs. Calvert, we can do it here. - Caesar's Palace would be bankrupt and your stock worthless. - At which point, we present ourselves to the gaming commission and offer to assume all debts in return for ownership. - Well, gentleman, why start a long drawn out fight? Why not settle it tonight? - Tonight? - You against the house. What'll it be blackjack, chemin de fer, what about a cut of the cards? - You serious? - Try me. - Okay, that does it. Chemin de fer. Oh... No ceiling. - No ceiling, sky's the limit. (laughs) Gentleman, you're gonna lose your shirts. - (sigh) I'll say one thing for ya ma'am, you sure have got guts. - No, just confidence. You see, Louie Lefevre will be playing for the house tonight. (dramatic ensemble) Lunch, gentleman? You really must try our smoked salmon. We fly it in from Scotland, it's the best in the world. - Smoked salmon? Hey, I wonder how that stacks up against a really good mess of catfish. - Oh, well all you can do is try it. - Thank you. - [Voiceover] Place your bets, ladies and gentleman. Please place your bets. All bets are closed. And, the gentleman that wins... Number 26 black. - Forgive me for opening my big mouth, but if I had to have a problem, I would choose yours. - [Voiceover] Thank you, ladies and gentleman, we're now placing bets. (knock) - Come in. - Well... - Not good, Benny. - You're gonna sell? - No, I told you I wouldn't do that. - What then? - Well... They're gonna try to break the house. - No way, we've got a ceiling on the stakes, we can close the table when we want. - I agreed to let them play... No ceiling. - You what? - Benny, I just had to risk it. Go for broke. - Good luck. - Well, somebody once said to me, "Luck turns up when you least expect it." Let's hope he was right. Marry, get me Mr, Lefevre suite. If he's not there have him paged. - Thank you. Yes? Well, hello. By this time you must know how much I enjoy being with you. Fine, the front entrance in a few minutes. Bye. - What? - Mrs. Calvert. She wants to take me for a drive. - Why? - When a beautiful woman asks you for a drive, you don't ask her why. - I do... With a face like mine, I have to be suspicious, but perhaps a drive with her will solve your problem. - What problem? - Which one of two woman to devote your talents to. - You talk too much. - This is a casino, you haven't sat down to play seriously even once yet. - I'm not a machine, Pokey. Sometimes even I'm not in the mood. (slot machine lever) - Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, that could almost make this trip worthwhile. - Hey, I thought you said slot machines were for peasants. - For a quarter of a million, I could overcome my prejudice. (laughs) (upbeat jazz) - You handle a car beautifully. - Car's like people have hearts, they respond to love. - Like people. Watch out for the mustangs, they run free out here. - Wild horses in Las Vegas, I had no idea. - Most people don't, they never leave the casino long enough to see if the sun's up. (chuckle) Thank goodness. - This ranch we're going to, is it yours? - It's my hideaway. Actually, it belongs to the hotel. Sometimes when we have special guests, I bring them up here. - I'm looking forward to it. - In the meantime, look out for mustangs. (chuckle) - Here we are. - Thank you. Not only mustangs, but I think I saw a deer. - Sometimes they come right up the house and feed from my hand. - That's a gift some people have. - Is it alright? - Mm, perfect. Madelaine, this wasn't a trip just to show me your hideaway, was it? - No... I wanted to talk to you and I just thought it would be easier out here. Louie, I'm gonna have to ask you again, will you stay and manage the hotel? - I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry. - That's alright, I understand. - You see, I've always been free, that's the way I live. I couldn't change that. - I know. I just had to ask you, it was important to me. - I have a feeling there's something more. - No... Well there was, but it doesn't involve you now. - Well, tell me anyway. - Howland gave me an ultimatum, either I sell or they're gonna win the hotel away from me. - How is that possible? - They're playing chemin de fer tonight, winner take all. - And you agreed? - [Madelaine] Yes. - Why? - I guess, I'm a bit of a gambler myself. Just thought it would be better to settle it once and for all. - Turn of the cards, I've done the same in my time. (snicker) - Well, let's hope Lady Luck knows on what side of the table to sit. (giggles) - I know Lady Luck very well, I'll get the word to her. - Louie, I owe you an apology. I did something this afternoon, I had no right to do. I was upset, I didn't know what I was saying and... I told them you were going to play for the house tonight. I'm sorry, it was stupid of me. Still friends? - Always. - Well, I think I better get back. If the Titanic's gonna go down, the least the captain can do is stay on the bridge. (dramatic ensemble) - Aishwarya, Swaps, Man o' War, Secretariat, humph... Sea Biscuit. Come on Sea Biscuit, you've got the rail. Go! Go! Look out for Man o' War, he's coming up fast. Go! (foreign language) You had the lead, why did you go to sleep? - The bitch is like a shootout, only they've got atom bombs. - Why did Mrs. Calvert agree to let them play? - She figured it was her only chance. She could be cleaned out. - That's crazy. - Sure it is, I tried to talk her out of it, I got no where. This goes bad tonight, she could just be left without a dime. She's already invested a big chunk of her own money in the building program. I gotta get back on the floor. - He won't take the job, Benny. (upbeat jazz) - How was the drive? - It was pleasant. - Did she tell you about the big game tonight? - She asked me to play for the house. - And? - What is this, an inquisition? - Did she tell you everything she has is riding on the line, including all her stock? Benny Marfo told me. - How could she be so foolish? - You're the expert on woman, you tell me? (cackles of laughter) I just got it. - [Louie] What? - I suddenly remembered where I saw her before, it was at Cap-Ferrat at the villa belonging to the movie star, the one with all the hair and the big derriere. - What are you talking about? - Last year at the villa at the top of the hill that is where I saw her. - That's impossible, if she was there I would remember her, believe me. - She wasn't at the party, she arrived just when we were leaving. I went out to wait for you by the car, I saw her drive up, and go around the back. I told you I knew her from somewhere. - Look, you don't know her, you just saw her. Why are you getting so excited? - It was in all the newspapers the next day. - If it makes sense, what was in all the newspapers the next day? - The report of the robbery, the movie star lost half a million in jewels. - Pokey, you're talking like a lunatic. - There's more... She told you, she was at the Casa del Sol in Aruba two months ago? - That's what she said. - Two months ago, at the Casa del Sol an attempt was made to rob an American plastics heiress. The attempt failed, but she was there. Now, find if she was in London when someone tried to steal the jade collection from the Chinese gallery. - She told me she was in London in September and October. - Uh-huh, and here she is with the Texan's wife and the only thing they have in common is one has jewels and the other would like to have them. Now, we're going to have to tell the police! - No. - No? - No, find out if Howland and his wife remain or leave the hotel after the game tonight. - Why? - Just for once, do what I ask without giving me an argument. - Okay! - Here ya go. - Thank you. What time is the game tonight? - Right after the midnight show. It'll be a massacre. The only thing that might make a difference is if your friend Lefevre plays for the house. He didn't say anything did he? - No... But, you have nothing to worry about, a man of your experience can get a job in any casino. - Who's worried about a job? It's Mrs. Calvert I'm worried about. She's the best. Her door is always open for anybody who's in trouble, needs help. Now, she stands to lose everything. (smooth jazz) - Am I keeping you from something? - What could possibly be more important to me than this? - It's the third time you've looked at your watch. - Well, that's only because I want this night to never end. - There's something on your mind, let's have it. - There's only one thing on my mind... You. - Louie, don't insult my intelligence. I know a stall when I see one. - You're right... It is an insult. Being with you gives me great pleasure but in this instance, I was trying to keep you here for your own protection. - Would you mind explaining that? - Well, I have no desire to see you in trouble with the police. Also, I'm concerned about Mrs. Calvert. I mean, she's got enough problems without the adverse publicity of a jewel theft. I had hoped to keep you here until it was too late for you to make an attempt at Mrs. Howland's jewels. - Terrific. - Now, look here, there's no necessity for that. - That's right. I'm a security agent with an insurance company. - You're not a thief? - I hate to disappoint you. - Oh, no, no, what I meant was... What must you think of me? - I think you're very sweet trying to save me from myself. - You work for Mrs. Calvert? - No, Mr. Howland hired me. Didn't want his wife to worry, so he didn't tell her. - All I can say, is that I feel very foolish. - Well, I've bungled a few myself along the way. - Like Cap-Ferrat... When the contessa lost her emerald necklace? - How did you know about that? - My associate saw you, that's why he thought you were a thief. That's why there's a strong possibility that I should kill him. (laughs) Will you accept my apology? I'm sorry I diverted you from your job. (smooth jazz) - Louie, you can divert me anytime. - A security agent. Can you imagine if I had turned her over to the police? Look, in future, do me a favor. Don't remember what you don't remember. - I'm sorry. - It's alright, everybody makes mistakes. Hey listen, I said it's alright. So, I was embarrassed, that's not the end of the world. Say something will ya. - Very well, I think you should take the job here. It's not as though I'm suggesting you become a used-car salesman. - I thought you were the one who was afraid that I should even consider the job. - Where is it written that a man cannot change his mind? - I still want to know why. - I think you should do it for Mrs. Calvert, all day I have heard nothing but good about her. Would it be such a terrible thing to help her? - I have a feeling there is also another reason. - Well, I think you should do it for us too, we've been knocking around the world for how long now, 20 years, no base, no real home? - So, that's what it was all about, the chateau in Bordeaux. - That's right. And, if I happen to think like a peasant, maybe that's because that's what I really am, where I began. - Now, look, I began in the backstreets and alleys of Algiers, do I have to go back to my beginnings? - Stop twisting my words. - It's your head that's twisted. - I'm only saying we need to belong someplace! - Is our life, the way we live, in tolerable? - No... When luck is with us, it's okay; maybe, more than okay. But, luck is not always with us and there's no guarantee it will be. - There's no guarantee the sun will come out tomorrow morning. - Again, your twisting my words. I'm only saying we need to belong someplace! Time marches on, as they say. You're not getting younger, I'm not getting younger. It's time you began to think of your future, which is also my future. - You can lead your own life. We're not bound together. - Oh... My mistake... I thought we were. (snicker) Why else would I cater to you? - Since when do you cater to me? - Who decides where we go and when? You do. Who wants everything arranged for his covenant convenience? You do. And, who sees to it? Me. I'll admit that the chateau in Bordeaux may have been a big thing, but for you to refuse to play for the house tonight when there's even a chance that it may make a difference, that I simply cannot accept. - You know I never gamble with somebody else's money. - You gamble with mine. (dramatic music) - Are you quite finished? - Quite. I'm... Catching the first plane out of here tomorrow. - Get back in the room. - Now look here my friend-- (action ensemble) (gunshot) (dramatic jazz ensemble) - Lady was bluffing, Lefevre ain't gonna play. - I took out insurance to guarantee he wouldn't play. Somethings are better not left to chance. (laughs) (crowd murmurs) - Some insurance policy you took out. - [Benny] Good luck. - I received your gift... Unfortunately, I broke it, I'm afraid it's damaged beyond repair. Well, gentleman, shall we begin? - Yeah, I'd say it's about time. - [Voiceover] 100,000. - [Howland] Is that all you can afford? - Mr. Howland, when you get to shoot, you name the stakes. - [Voiceover] Cards, please. Mr. Howland shows a natural nine. Mr. Howland wins with a natural nine over seven. - Let it ride. - [Voiceover] That's 200,000 to you Mr. Lefevre. Cards, please. - Card, please. - [Voiceover] A third card to Mr. Lefevre Mr. Howland shows a seven and five, a total of two. Mr. Lefevre shows a six up. The bank may draw a third card. Mr. Howland shows an eight. (crowd murmurs) Mr. Howland wins with an eight over seven. - [Howland] Stay. - [Voiceover] The bet is 400,000 to you Mr. Lefevre. Eight bundles sir. Cards, please. (laugh) (crowd murmurs) A natural nine. Mr. Howland wins with a natural nine over four. - (laugh) Let it ride, let it ride. - [Voiceover] The bet is 800,000 to you Mr. Lefevre. Cards, please. Mr. Howland wins with a natural eight over seven. Cards, please. - Stay. (laugh) - [Voiceover] Mr. Howland shows a natural nine. (crowd groans) Mr. Howland wins with a natural nine over eight. - The whole bank! (dramatic music) Let's see you cover that. Everything against the house. - Banco. (crowd gasps) - [Voiceover] The house has covered your bet Mr. Howland. Cards, please. Your cards, Mr. Lefevre. - Card, please. - [Voiceover] A third card to Mr. Lefevre. Mr. Howland shows a six. Mr. Lefevre shows a six. The bank may draw a third card. Mr. Howland shows a total of six. Mr. Lefevre wins with a nine over six. (glass break) - [Madelaine] You were fantastic. - Luck was with me. - Oh, don't argue with me, I said you were fantastic. - Alright, reasonably fantastic. - You knew you were gonna win didn't you? - Not until the house began to lose steadily. You forget I've already played against those three. I knew that once they began to win and win big they'd make the same mistake they made in the past, get over confident, and forget the one thing no gambler should ever forget... The law of odds. That it's vital to be sensitive to that moment when the cards turn. Instead, they risked it all at the wrong moment. But, they'll return you know? - You think so? - I'm convinced; not only to recoup their losses, but to seek vengeance against me. - Well, you won't be here. - I can be. - You mean you... You mean you've reconsidered, you'll take the job? - The job? Managing a 400-hundred-million dollar enterprise is more than a job. (laugh) - What made you change your mind? - Maybe it's time for me to stop wondering, to consider the future, Poquette's future as well as mine. We're bound together, Pokey and I. - Welcome to Caesar's Palace. And, thank you. - You're welcome. And, I thank you. Do you remember the first toast we ever drank? - Wasn't that long ago... To the other side of the hill? - I've always been intrigued by what may lie on the other side of the hill. - I'll drink to that. (cups clink) - There will be no dirty dishes left in the corridors. I will tolerate no such sloppiness in my hotel. Remove it please, thank you. - The job has gone to your head. I can see you're going to be one colossal pain in the derriere. - Well, if I am, I know I can depend on you to be the first to say so. Thank you, my friend. - For what? - For just being my friend. (upbeat jazz) It isn't the chateau near Bordeaux. - Who wants to live in Bordeaux? They don't even have a casino there. (audience applause) - Okay, thank you. Thank you, go on. Thank you very much, thank you. Thank you, oh just like it. - [Voiceover] Fantastic display of the odds. - [Louie] Thank you, thank you. Go on, shoot the dice, come on. Thank you. (upbeat jazz)
