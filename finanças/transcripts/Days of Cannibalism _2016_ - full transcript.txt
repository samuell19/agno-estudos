Here you go. Give me change, okay? Let me give you 4 yuan. Give me 4 yuan, I change 40. - There you go. - 3 yuan. Thank you. Can I check my order? Sometimes you guys pack something that I didn't need. I have your business card. I want to check the stuff. Sometimes you guys don't put the right colours ordered. So I have to make sure. Make sure, have same same. It is important, Africa is too far. Xiu Shan Hotel. Sign. What is this? What is this? Receipt. Room 2313. I give you, you say no here. Receipt for what? - Maybe somebody took it already. - Who? - Your brother. - Is my brother here? You ask him. But we are together. - Sign. - What is this? Mike no here, live here, no here, why?

The Nation's Pride. The Nation's Pride! Stand back. - That's how you ride a horse. - The Nation's Pride. I'm scared of him, he's too much for me. Join us, join us. Gentlemen, join us. 50 rand on Tsentisile. Gentlemen, join us. 50 rand on Tsentisile. 50 rand on Tsentisile. The name, the name. Chinatown. Where is it? - Chinatown? - Yes, yes. I don't know. The name of your town. I'm from Lesotho, Thaba-Tseka. You are from where in China? You Chinatown? I'm from Lesotho, Thaba-Tseka. You're from where in China? China, Fuijan. I don't know how to say that in Sesotho. No problem, speak Chinese. Speak Chinese. Where are you from? 98. Plus 9 kg gas. - 9 kg gas? - Yes. 288. Oh dear. What will I put back? - 282. - 282? Still not enough? My dear listeners, that was the introduction. This is how we always start. You know I've always wanted to live in Stockholm. Today at four we have the programme 'Be Knowledgeable'. But there is an issue I want to talk about. There seem to be other nations and cultures coming into our country and mixing with us. In Butha-Buthe there are many Indians. But they haven't assimilated to our way of life. Now we also have Chinese living here. I want to say to you, listeners that the Chinese have joined us here in Lesotho. I even know some of them, without mentioning their names, who live in Lesotho and have become citizens. Others are here just for work. I hear some might even have mountain enclosures with animals. How would you feel if you saw a Chinese playing a shepherd's flute while herding cows? Or holding up one of our fighting sticks? Herding cows with whistles or playing a shepherd's guitar? In Sesotho the cow is called 'the wet-nosed god'. This is because every single job and all aspects of life involve cows. Remember, a Mosotho boy would never... leave the neighbour's cows only taking his to graze. Many of these customs are done with now. You can call me here on Mojodi FM to talk about these things. This one, Mr Intololo, how much is it? 5000? - This one? - Yes, it's 5000. - And that one is 3000? - Yes. And that one over there? Does it have ringworm? No, that's not ringworm. It's ticks. - That's ticks? - Yes. - Where did you buy that cow? - At the police auction. - How much did you pay? - 3.5. 3.5 for that cow. And this one? That was 1000 at the auction. - Only 1000? - Yes. - And this one? - The black and brown one. That was 5500. - 5500? - Yes. You got a really good cow there. It is a very good cow. And it's female. You got a really good deal there. What about this one? With the colours on its underbelly. - How much was it? - It was 1.5. - 1.5? - Yes. And that one, what colour is it? Black and brown with grey? In English it's called coffee. - Coffee? - Yes, exactly, coffee. Tea that is coffee-coloured. - So how much was it? - I got it for... - 5.5. - 5.5? - Yes. - Gosh, that is a very good cow. - Has it calved yet? - No, but it will soon. There's a Chinese man who's called 'Son-In Law'. - Do you know him? - Yes. Do you often go head-to-head with him? He bids. He bids really high. I met Son-In-Law once, and spoke with him. - In Sehonghong. - I was scared of him. That man bought 20 cows. All at once. You both bid on a cow. A black and brown one, similar to this one. The one he got for 4000. - Remember you bid 3000? - Yes. There's a woman as well, called Yin Zhu. - She is very cunning. - I'm scared of her too. That Chinese woman is so cunning. They scare me, as they have money. They have loads of money, those people. There is a blackish ox over there. Or is it black? It has a different colour tail. And a colour on its underbelly. It's moving toward the donkeys. Place your finger, please. Place your finger, please. Look, our architect did that. It's good. He added height. - I passed it by car. - Yeah, this is necessary. It must be done this way. I didn't ask him to do it. I thought you did. I didn't think about it at the beginning. - Very efficient. - Honestly, if we get the land, if we do the first step right, I have thought about it. A wholesale store can't be bigger than 2000 m2. Otherwise it will be too big. Way too big, damn it! No problem, we'll use our soil as landfill. I'm worried that there may be rocks beneath the soil. Obviously we can't tell just by looking. We have to get underneath the top layer fast. Then we will know. Let's do this: we'll shovel off the top layer and fill it up from below. If that's not enough, we'll ask the government to landfill it. Do you know who can do this? Intaloe, who makes the roads. He used to do it for us. We can also get Mpho to do it, after we double-check with Mr Bachelor. It's a big job. We have to negotiate the price. Now that the Chinese are setting themselves up here... others will come as well. There will be a lot of competition. The sooner, the better. Levelling of the ground must cost a couple million. Dismantle it step by step. It will take a little more than a year. No, Poppi, don't. They can't buy it if you play with it. - Is the woman still selling it? - No, not anymore. Will you sell it? No way. - Minus 20 rands. - Minus 30, at least. So how much? At my store I sold four or five each season. I made almost 200 on each. No one sells horseshoes here. The Africans came asking for them. I didn't know what it was. What are they called? Horseshoes. Horse...? It was only when they explained it, did I understand what they are. Same here. Finally I understood. I understood, but my brain couldn't follow. I sold a few two days ago, but I still didn't get it. Goldspink. I split a pair. I have three, six, nine Wans. Damn! Three, six, nine Wans, three Tong! Knock-knock. Open up, it's the police. We're the police. You know what, boys? Listen carefully. I'm looking for some cows. What about the grey cow? - This one? - Yes. This one was left by a man from Ha Qotho. That's another of his. - He has three cows here? - No just those two. - What's his name? - Mr Mzwele. Why did he leave them here? I don't know. Come on, let's go. Do you see anything? Impossible to hide them here. Even if they herded them to the top. What brings us here today, is that I'm going to discuss the law. We have a lot of laws in Lesotho, right? I'm going to talk specifically about the laws that apply to your animals. These animals are our livelihood, correct? I'm going to discuss the laws that protect your animals. You know these laws. So I am just reminding you. If there are animals in an enclosure that aren't yours and you open the enclosure, looking to take them, then those animals that you took without permission and brought back to your home villages become a problem. In that case we will charge you for rearing the animals illegally since you don't have documents for them. This is the second crime of the act. Whether it is the community policing forum or just two men from this village, if they come to your animal enclosure and ask for the animal's documents, you are required by law to produce the necessary documents. If you refuse, that is a... crime. I'm looking for soap, not these things you sell. 3.50. - How much are you missing? - 50 cents. That isn't very much money. He even knows how to cook beans. Honestly. You see I got a puncture. Tomorrow morning it will be flat. Dear listeners, it is 6:05 PM. As promised, I bring you the news programme. I will be speaking to Superintendent Litsietsi Selimo. He is Chief of Police here in Thaba-Tseka. He is going to update us on what reports his office has. I really want to thank the men of Pontšeng. As soon as they heard the news on this radio station, they got up in the middle of the night went out and recovered a stolen herd of animals. However, the thieves were able to get away. It seemed to concern 15 cows, which had been stolen in Matatiele, South Africa. I would like to meet and congratulate these men. In the mean while, my police officers were deep asleep. One would have thought that they would have been the first respondents to the crime. But the Pontšeng community decided to get up and act. I will make sure this won't happen again. The court, may sit. The first accused is you, Molomo-motšo Lotšoahla. - Yes, Your Honour. - From Matebeng Matlakeng. - Yes, Your Honour. - The second is Maseko Litšoatla. - Is that so? - Yes, Your Honour. - Can you read and write? - No, Your Honour. - You can't read or write? - Correct, Your Honour. One of you or both of you together, were found in possession of 15 cows, that you were unable to legitimately explain. These are the two charges you are facing. I have been advised that this is an old case, and in this regard you will represent yourself. Further, you have been advised that it concerns a large number of cows you've been charged with. Nevertheless you're still going to represent yourself. - Is that correct? - Yes, Your Honour. Second accused, do you agree? I do. The accused shall sit and listen to how we proceed. Before proclaiming a verdict I would like the court to be aware that the accused have come before a court of law before and have already, once before, been found guilty. - You said 15 cows? - Yes, Your Honour. They were found to be in possession of 15 cows. They were herding 15. In addition to these 15 cows, there were actually 5 more, according to the accused and subsequent investigation. Of which three, Your Honour, were sold to a Chinese businessman who is said to have already slaughtered them for a feast. Regarding animals, especially because here in Lesotho animals are wealth, they represent life, so that animals and livestock are equivalent to money here. Stealing animals is literally destroying a Mosotho's livelihood, Your Honour. It's a terrible crime. What's more is that in this particular case it's a crime that took place across international borders. These circumstances make this a very serious case, Your Honour. First accused, stand up. How do you plead before I pronounce verdict? There is massive unemployment in Lesotho. This is what forced me to cross the border and steal those cows. It was to keep my children alive. Your Honour, in our families we not only take care of our own children, but also of the orphans. There is no way for us to clothe our wives, or even our children. This is why we had to barter the cows for food and basic necessities just so our children could eat. It's not out of choice we end up doing these things. There is no work, not even in the mines and we have nothing. This is the reason we ended up taking the wrong path. Your Honour. What can we do? Shall I send you to jail? I pray that this court will show us mercy, Your Honour. The children will be alone? The children will be all alone. Okay, sit down, sir. Let's hear you now, sir. What shall I do? Well, do as you judge wise. Do you also have a wife and children? My wife passed away. I understand you are sitting next to your employer. Does he pay you a monthly salary? No, he does not. - He doesn't pay you? - Indeed, he doesn't. How does he expect you to live? I don't know. So who helps you with clothing and food? Well, I manage. You take care of yourself. You may sit down again. The accused, please stand. The court has considered the following. As stated by the prosecutor, the accused have appeared in court before and were found guilty. Now they are back in court for the same crime. The court feels that they haven't learned their lesson and require a harsher sentence. The second matter the court has considered is that animals are all-important for the Basotho. It's their means of living, their entire livelihood. There are no more jobs in the mines. The verdict that this court will pronounce needs to set an example to others. We need to give you a sentence that shows you that the court is not a playground. If you have been here before, you can't come back. You need to be stopped. You won't get the opportunity to pay a fine. You had that chance the first time. So each one of you will be sentenced to ten years in jail. No fine possible. You may complain to the Maseru High Court... that this sentence is too harsh. It is your right to appeal. And since I have sentenced you to ten years I will send this verdict to Maseru. They will review it and see if it should be increased. - The court is adjourned. - All rise. What else is here? Why couldn't I input anything on the list? Put in 500 more. Can you check if it's put in? Have a look who is the receiver? The receiver is... The date on the invoice should be earlier than this. It should be earlier than this, but later than that. Maybe you didn't receive this money. How much was it? What are you doing right now? I'm cooking some lamb. Can't you see me? Your signal is bad. I no longer have Wi-Fi in the shop. - Are you at home? - I'll show you. So whose horse is that? I bought it from Hou. - Did he give you the documents? - No. I see that the brandings and markings are new. So you're going to be charged with having an animal that doesn't have proper documentation and that has new branding and marking. Do you hear me? Yes. Wait outside the police station. I have a simple question. I don't have many questions, just this one. - You knew the horse was stolen? - Yes. So you bought something you knew was stolen. Which then makes you a thief as well. And now look at you. Now you appear as the guilty one. Not the person you bought it from. If you needed a horse, why didn't you buy one? You have cows at your place. Why didn't you exchange a cow for a horse? You are the male heir of our family. You are the only boy, the others are all girls. Now they are crying because you aren't there. Because of your stupidity. While you're supposed to be responsible for the home you're running away from the police. Your father left the herd to you when he died. It's as if the cows have no value to you. Should they die out in the wilderness? Do they overwhelm you, sir? Honestly, I don't know what to say. I have nothing left to say. You are shaming us. These are things that we never grew up with. Now we are here instead of going about our lives. I'm really tired and feel defeated. Self-inflicted wounds deserve no sympathy. You did this to yourself. I was very unhappy to hear about this. I'm going home now. I'll tell them we spoke. - Okay, see you. - Yes. Mr Mei, your voice is coming and going. You keep disappearing. - Network problems. Probably. - It's the network. It must be the network. It must be the network, because I'm standing still. You're clear now, go ahead. This week, on Monday, when we met with that team they told us that they want to meet the employers. To hear their side, and make sure that the Chinese, who are the main employers will pay the right amount of money. The minimum wage is 2000. As a union we think this is too low. But if we demand a pay rise at the factories it gets very difficult. We are going to ask for a 150% increase because the wages really are too low. I had a guy who worked for me for ten years. He stole phone cards then money. He looked like an honest man. Everybody steals. That's for sure. That's why those responsible need to be family. There is no other way. To have no theft at all is impossible. With regard to China if you compare China to here other than that there are a lot of firearms one lives well here. In China you are always spending money. Here there is no place to spend it. Sure. About my trip to China, I had a good time. You can ask Mr Satchuong. We spent a lot of time together. We went to Karaoke almost every day and did a lot of drinking. - We went singing. - And drinking? Every single day. You think Satchuong stays at home every night, like us? Not at all, he goes out a lot. If anyone asks him to go for a drink, he goes. He has many friends. - I know. - He drinks every day. Does your dad take care of your son back home? No, he needs to go to work to earn money. There's no need to make hasty decisions. Little Mei! Little Mei! She's being difficult. It's very late and she doesn't want to sleep. What is she doing, playing with her bottle? She's very happy. She just doesn't want to sleep when put to bed. It's the first time I see that dress. I just bought it the other day. Adidi didn't want to go out today? He already went out after eating. He finished his homework. But all he wants to do is to go out and have fun. We eat this two or three times a week. I'm fed up with it. You eat too much. Pinch it here. You can also use the right hand. I shouldn't ask to break the silence Deep inside you But my heart is beyond the border I want all of you I shouldn't ask For something that is gone But how can I escape The chains of my heart The Chinese are abusing us I say they are abusing my people The Chinese are abusing us We are suffering in their factories The Chinese are abusing us The Chinese are abusing us We are suffering in their factories We are suffering in their factories My dear brethren, if there is anything you want to talk about, you can call me on 53 69 33 32. How would you feel if I told you that the Chinese owned a cattle herd just like a Mosotho, because they live in Lesotho? Does this mean they have accepted our culture now? And then what would you say if a Mosotho owned a wholesale store and succeeded just like a Chinese? We would like the Chinese to come and talk to us and teach us how to set up a wholesale store. And we will teach them how to work with cows. And we'll show them our traditions and culture. So let us accept the Chinese and teach them. They may even learn to sing songs of praise to the cows. Then the Chinese are exactly where we need them to be. I want to invite a Chinese man, a friend of mine to come to the radio station. I will speak Chinese next week. That's how things are my dear listeners of Mojodi FM. Here is someone I really like. He was in a group called Wham and then went solo. I love it when he sings 'Careless Whisper'. You got that one, now try to tie a knot. It's injection time. We have to kill the lice. The Chinese have no idea how to take care of the cattle. Hold the rope there. I need to hold it here. Like this. Wait, wait. I don't have a good grip. I don't have a good grip. Hold the other horn. Wait, wait, wait. Hold the other horn. I need a proper grip. That's it. Let's untie it. I'll take the top. Now it's running with it. Leave it, leave it. Don't worry, I'll get it. Once the injection is done, it's easy. They've been up in the mountains so they're a bit wild now. We're taking care of them. As shepherds we look after them. The owners, the Chinese, only care about the money. But the actual work, taking care of them, that's all up to us. My countrymen come outside And see oxen coming up the plain They don't have a shepherd Manchoabola If it were yesterday I'd say: Grandmother, look, I'm starving Standing on a hill I would say there is a cow With spots on the plain, the mountain If it were yesterday there is a black And brown cow, I can call it by name Its name is Nteteletsane, a lady, a girl So when the young men appear Christening the nations I'd say, grandmother Bring her back alive So when she appears From the bushes, from the plains, I will appear on this side and say Men look, here are oxen They say there is a red ox, they call it Mother Nteteletsane somebody's wife. When she appears, christening The nations, you should bow to her. They say, come with her alive. They say there is black and brown cow, but with a grey back. My countrymen Stop christening the nations This cow will eat and finish them all This cow is called Ha e eo Greetings, I greet you all in peace - How much? - I'll weigh it first. To check how much it costs. Don't you have 2 rand? - 2 rand or 1.50? - 2 rand or whichever. He's making fools of us. - What? - Nothing, continue. - How much is this? - 3.50. And some Halls. No chance. This is all you can have. Greetings, Superintendent Selimo. I greet you, sir. You are most welcome at Mojodi FM the station from our hometown Thaba-Tseka. This evening I am with my colleague Thabiso Rabiri we are listening to you together, sir. The week before last there was a very serious attack in which a female Chinese shop owner and her Basotho employees were attacked with guns. The reports state there were more than five armed men. The police responded, but they got there too late.
