This is Gumtali, a village in Punjab, near the Pakistan border which currently is under the terror of goons dealing in drugs. Drug dealers flourish here as they've the protection of the big players of the political world. That is why these people operate here without any fear. How are you all? - We are fine. Sit, sit. What is your name? Bittu Brar. Mr Brar... I guess you are new. Perhaps that's why you don't know that word is what counts in our business. We don't keep any account on paper. But Mr Sucha Singh, I want a receipt of my payment. Go home and look into the mirror. You'll be able to clearly see my signature on your face. Take him away! The fool was demading signature from Sucha Singh! Let it be. He's a new guy. Why spoil your mood over him? Yes Balwant, how did your meeting with your brother-in-law go? My son and I went and met him together yesterday... And you're aware that we've connects even abroad. Yes. Yes. Outsider? When? I'll check. Hey, go and check. An outsider is roaming in the factory. Shall I also go, sir? - Yes, go. Go quickly. A silencer is really wonderful. Along with the gun, it also silences the man on whom it's aimed. Am I right, Mr MLA? Well done, Mr Dogra. Bravo! You did a great job. Your gun proved your worth today. Sir, it is my duty. I'm the guard, I'll stay awake. You can go and sleep in peace. All right. Injustice rules here. Cruetly is king. These liars usually blow out the lamps of truth of the honest. But it's said, when evil reaches its zenith the earth goes into turmoil. And then, to put an end to this cruelty a brave warrior is born. Quiet! It's 12:00 already, but the man hasn't come with the money yet. Don't scare anyone. Don't be afraid of anyone. God advices that you must not scare anyone nor must you fear anyone. Who are you? - You fool! Don't you know that 12 O'clock is the time of Singh! Look back into history. When the cruel Mughals like you kidnapped people's sisters and daughters to save them, the Singhs would attack them at 12 O' clock... Stop right there or I'll shoot you! It's your first mistake so I'm forgiving you. Next time I'll shoot your brains off, you understand? Glory be to the lord and his men! How are you? Glory be to the lord and his men! Singh, were you victorious? Yes Babaji, the girl has reached her home safely. Thank God! Son Ranjodh, the time has come. Prepare to leave for Gumtali. As you say, Babaji. I'll leave tomorrow itself. May God always be with you.

"The warrior swells his chest and fights cruelty" "Warrior!" Tell me. Sir, I brought a house and now the seller is breaking the deal. I've completed the registration but he's refusing to vacate. Okay. Go and sit. - Thank you. File his report. - Okay, sir. Who's next? Greetings, sir. Sir, my name is Horr Singh. I am very troubled. What is your problem? - What? What is your problem? What do I say? I'm very upset. A dog tricked me. - Which dog tricked you? Sir, I'm not talking of men, I'm talking of my guard dog. I'd brought him to protect my house from thieves. Others bring home a dog to talk to them, is it? Fool! Tell me what your problem is. Sir, thieves entered my house. The dog did a terrible thing. The thieves threw him a bone so he didn't bark. He remained silent and they committed the heist. You are laughing? The thieves stole my valuables. So did you lodge a complaint? The issue here isn't about filing a complaint against the thieves. Then what is it? It's about the dog. He didn't bark at the thieves. What should I do, please tell me. Shoot the bloody dog, matter ends. That's exactly what I want to do. Even I was thinking of shooting the rascal. - All right! Who's next? What are you doing here yet? Leave. - I want to thank you. It's okay. By the way, in Balwinder's case, even you behaved like the dog. Who? Balwinder Singh? Who are you? - Your death! Let's get out of here. - Hurry! Run! "Warrior! Warrior!" "Warrior!" "Warrior!" Today, in village Gumtali... DSP Deepak Dogra was killed in broad daylight. He was shot at while he was hearing the complaints of the villagers. Although the police are trying their best to nab the culprit but they've no clue yet about the killer. As to who killed DSP Deepak Dogra and why he killed him for now, no one has the answers to that. We have arrived at Gumtali. We have arrived! Tom, get up! - What, what, what? We have reached, man! This is it? - Yeah. I was expecting some Indian beauties, man. Oh, you dirty mind. Sir, where have you brought this monkey from? You rascal! Shut up! Just enjoy the weather. Pyaro, look, master has come. Where is he? - The young Sardar is standing right before you. Greetings, sir. - Mordern Sardar's are like that. Help me take their luggage. Tom, this is my house, ancestral house. What architecture. Reminds me of Taj, eh? My great grandpa actually built it, you see. - Yeah? This way. Come. No one from the family lives in this house anymore. - Oh, really? Yeah, just those two servants only. Those two crazy people, eh? Yeah, you know these villagers, they're a riot. Pyaro, where is the foreigner? He took the tractor and went to the fields. He took the tractor? Are you crazy? Why did you give him the keys? He was very stubborn. He took it himself and left. How foolish. Wait master, I'm making tea for you. Ronnie. Hey, hello! Hmm? - What thoughts are you lost in? Strange fellow. Darn! What happened, dude? Who is she? Nothing, bro. - Nothing? Come, let me show you something about nothing. Come. Okay, are you ready? - Yeah. Show me. - Watch. She is my girl! Dude, are you serious? You won't understand, Tom. This is love at first sight. Love? Are you mad or something? Tom, I'm very happy. I'm very happy today. Leave that! These mosquitoes are such a pest! Forget the mosquitoes. You did a big thing today. Big thing! - It's nothing, bro, it's nothing. You did. Just give me a hug. Give me a hug. I love you, brother. - Love you, buddy. Nothing. Let's go, Ronnie. I guess she won't come. Let's wait some more time. I've a feeling that she'll surely come. I have to see her. There is no one else here. The whole universe is waiting. Wait. The wind, the birds, all are waiting for her. You've started doing poetry. Love makes one poetic, Tom. You won't understand. Beware! She may make you something else. - She's come! Keep driving. Yes, stop at the side. Be safe. Thank God I met you or I would've died today. Met me? Hey, who are you? Who are you to talk to me like that? I'm Ronnie Brar, from UK. Just assume I've come to Punjab only for you. I mean, we are made for each other. - Hey, stop! You don't need to show off with your English. There are many like you roaming the streets. Now you have joined the crowd. And that too, especially from England. Have you looked at your face? You look like a joker. Joker? Madam, wait, listen to me. Give me your address. I'll come to your house and talk to your dad. Oh, really? You'll talk to my dad? You have the courage? Of course. Test me. Do you know who my dad is? I really don't know. My dad is a cop with Punjab police, ASI Balwinder Singh Sidhu. He'll break your legs. Move aside. Bloody lover boy! What was the name of her dad? ASI Balwinder Singh Sidhu? Dad, it's my turn. Let me take the queen. - Take the queen. I'm leaving. And I bequeath all my points to my sister. Give her all your points, yet I'll defeat her. Never. Until I'm with her, my sister can never lose. I won't lose. You lost. Dad cheated. Get lost! Dad, that's cheating! - No, I didn't cheat. You cops can never stop yourselves from cheating. Don't always insult my department over every little thing. All cops aren't like that. - Really? Don't measure all of them with the same scale, it's not right. No, no, you've cheated. - Go and see who's at the door. Promise me you won't touch my coins. - I won't. Go. Go see who's at the door. You! You've come to my house! Where is the cop? Kid, you better leave, or you'll really get treated! Really? I have come for treatment. You better leave. Leave! Deepi! - Yes, dad. Who is it? - No one. Dad, someone is here to see you. I'm coming. Sister, who is this man? - Come, I'll tell you. Greetings, uncle. - Greetings. Tell me. - Uncle, I'm Ronnie. Ronnie? - Ronnie Brar from UK. Ronnie Brar from UK? Oh, my God! He's going to get thrashed today. I will not be able to watch, Gogi. Gogi, just check if dad is beating up that boy. Oh, great, son! No sister, grandpa is hugging him. He must not be hugging him he must be throtlling him. Look properly. Yes. - Okay! No, grandpa has made him sit in a chair. Sit in a chair? - They're laughing and chatting away. They are laughing and chatting? What's wrong with dad? Son, after the untimely death of my friend Surjan Singh and his wife... I assumed my ties with that family are severed forever. But no. I am proud of you. Bless you! You've proved that ties of love are stronger than ties of blood. So, tell me, what brings you here? Uncle, my mom and dad wanted me to marry a girl from Punjab. To fulfill their wish, I came to meet you. I mean, I came to Punjab. Baljeet, get some refreshments. Someone very dear has come visiting. Tell me, what are you doing in UK? I run a chain of restaurants in London. - Good. Wow, that's really nice. Greetings, aunty. - Greetings, son. Help yourself, son. Who is this boy? He's actually being welcomed. Bye aunty, bye uncle. - Bless you, son. He's left. - He left? Despite living abroad, he has Indian values. He is a very good boy. You're quite impressed by him. Dad, who was he? - He's Ronnie. He's the son of my friend Surjan Singh from England. Ronnie? - Yes, Ronnie. Have you forgotten? You used to play together when you were little. Ronnie? That joker? - Yes, the same Ronnie. So Navi, tell me, how do I look? You look so funny! Funny? "My every sinew was waiting for love" "A beloved has come and awakened love in all of them" "I kept calling for my beloved" "That beloved has come to meet me today" "I want to wear a ring on you" "I wait desperately for you to belong to me" "Your eyes are so mersmersing" "They've cast a spell on me" "Your eyes are so mersmersing" "They've cast a spell on me" "I'll cast away all evil eyes on you" "I'll perform rituals to keep you safe" "I'll cast away all evil eyes on you I'll perform rituals to keep you safe" "No one can cast an evil spell on us now" "God himself has brought us together" "I kept calling for my beloved" "That beloved has come to meet me today" "You dwell deep in my heart" "I'm totally possessed by you" "You dwell deep in my heart I'm totally possessed by you" "Your name is engraved on my soul" "I can read it with my eyes closed" "Your eyes are so mersmersing" "They've cast a spell on me" "Engulf me in your arms" "Hold me in your breath" "Engulf me in your arms Hold me in your breath" "My every sinew is fragrant with your essence" "You have possessed my heart" "I kept calling for my beloved" "That beloved has come to meet me today" "Giggling and laughing" "You have to come to me" "Giggling and laughing You've to come to me" "My life belongs to you, beloved" "I've laid my heart at your feet" "Your eyes are so mersmersing" "They've cast a spell on me" "I kept calling for my beloved" "That beloved has come to meet me today" "Your eyes are so mersmersing" "They've cast a spell on me" Alright. -Okay. You should've stayed back a few more days. We would have had a good time. Have a good time with your beau now. Come on. I'll miss you, buddy. - Take care. Bye. Take him to the airport. He has a habit of messing with people so take him straight to the airport. So much for the land of Kamasutra! Left me with nothing. Get lost now, okay. Okay! Why do you worry, she's only engaged yet. She has to marry you only. Bali, don't talk nonsense. Just tell me where she is. She was going to shop at the mall. She's busy preparing for the marriage. No worries, I'll apply the ritualistic henna on her today. Watch what happens next. Dheera. Yes, bro. Have you seen the film Putte Jatta De? Which one, the new or old one? Which new one? I'm talking about Jagira, the Jatt. I've seen the film where the bad man always gets the girl. Just like the bad guy gets the girl in that film... - Yes. even I will. But the bad guys in that film came on horses. Even I have a horse (gun). And even this one kicks real hard. Bro, there she is. Hey, stop the car right in front of her. Hello! What brazen behavior is this? Leave my arm! How can I leave you? I love you. I want to marry you. Leave me, let me go! - if you don't relent, I'll kidnap you. Leave my arm. Hey, stop. Where are you running? Catch her! Move! Move! Officer, I must praise your courage. You have slapped Goga. That too in public. I have to reward you for this. Give that gun to me and come to the police station with me. No, officer, no. I've to reward you. I've to put a medal on your chest. Here's the medal, accept it. Dad! Dad! - Let's go! Come! I'll take you with me. - Let's go! Dad! ^Brothers, I plead with you, please save my father! Someone please take my father to the hospital. Dad! Stand straight, don't move! I don't want to waste my bullet. Empty the whole magazine... Boys, leave us alone. Bye, bro. - Bye. What happened? Why are you so angry? I've to tell you what has happened? Like, as if you don't know what has happened. You shoot a cop in broad daylight and then ask me what has happened. Baldev, all my life's work, my entire political career you have ruined in a moment. Mr MLA, if you only start calling your brother a killer even the people will. It's time to play politics. Greetings. I represent MLA Sucha Singh. He deeply regrets the death of your father. He said that he'll ensure you get maximum compensation... - Stop! Bali, don't give me that nonsense. I know you and your MLA only too well. Just get lost! Madam, you are wise. What is done is done, but you don't die with the dead. Please make your son see sense. The MLA has your interest at heart. The police have arrested one Karnail Singh Kala for the murder of ASI Balwinder Singh. DSP Deepak Dogra has said that Kala had shot the ASI in full public view. Sir, why did Kala shoot the ASI? We are investigating. You'll get all the news soon. Sir, some people say that MLA Sucha... Singh's brother Gagandeep Goga is also involved in this case? No, we have no such report. No witness has given evidence of Goga's presence at the scene of crime. That's it. Thank you. Sir, one more question. - Thank you! Deepak Dogra has denied the presence of... Gangandeep Goga at the scene of crime. Kala has confessed his crime to the police. There are many questions in this case whose answers will come only with time. Although the police claims that Kala shot ASI Balwinder Singh but according to some people, the ASI was shot dead by MLA Sucha Singh's brother Goga. But no one is ready to confess this to the police. Put up security. - Yes, sir. Put seven men on the job. - Yes, sir. Uncle, what's going on? Goga killed my father. He was shot in the market everyone saw it and you've arrested Kala? Child, sit down. We will talk. Please have a seat. Go and arrange security. - Yes, sir. Look dear you are mistaken. The man who is guilty has been arrested. All the witnesses have said that. In fact even a cop, Surjit Singh, from our department has said the same. What are you talking, uncle? He shot dead my dad right before my eyes. I am an eye witness to the crime. Record my statement and arrest that bloody Goga. No dear, you don't speak ill words. No dear, not at all. The law does not work on emotions. Law works on evidence. The day we lay hands on evidence, we won't spare the culprits. ASI Balwinder Singh was a brave cop of Punjab police. I'm proud of him. On a personal level, I'm very sad over his murder. But we won't let the sacrifice of a brave cop like Balwinder go waste. Not at all. We will investigate. You go home now, your mother must be alone. We will do our job, trust me. Go. Go home. Take her home. What's written on your uniform? Deepak Dogra. It is wrong. Instead you should wear the 'sold out' batch. Hang your price tag there, the price at which you were bought. Let's go, Deepi. No point talking to a corrupt officer. Son, your father was a brave officer. We are proud of him. You don't worry about anything. I'm with you, the government is with you. All right? Good day. Mr MLA, we heard your brother... - No personal questions. This isn't a press conference or a public rally. It's a sad moment and I've come to share the sorrow of this family. No, not at all. I said no personal questions. Greetings. Why had he come here? He had come to give us compensation of 2.5 million. And he also offered the job of your dad to your brother. Mom, he hadn't come to give compensation he had come to bribe us. He wants us to remain silent. What else can we do if not remain silent? We cannot fight these people. Brother, truth has immense power. Just support me and we will fight them. Fight them indeed! What did your dad gain fighting them? He lost his life. So what do you want, that we forget dad was murdered? You think I'll forget? - That's what you're doing. Shame on your thoughts! Dad, I miss you. Ronnie, I've no one to call my own. Don't say this. We will fight. We will fight! The murder of Punjab police ASI Balwinder... Singh will be investigated by IPS officer Vikram Chauhan. The court has taken this decision after hearing the petition of Navdeep Kaur, daughter of ASI Balwinder Singh. Navdeep Laur has alleged that her fatgher was killed by... MLA Sucha Singh's brother Goga Taliwal. She had requested a high level inquiry in this matter. Hmm. Madam, tell me about that incident in detail. I'd gone shopping to the bazaar that day. Goga Taliwal came there with his men. He brazenly started misbehaving with me in public. Everything happened in front of your shop. You tell us, who fired the shots? Sir, I was not at the shop that day. I'd taken my child to the hospital. I didn't see anything. You didn't see anything? - I didn't see anything, sir. I saw. Sucha Singh's brother Goga shot at the cop. Father, don't say anything. Why should we get into trouble for others? We didn't see anything. Tell me, why did you tell the police that you killed ASI Balwinder Singh? I'd say kill Sucha Singh! He has lured my son with some money and trapped him in a murder case. He's ruined his life. Okay, so this Karnail Singh, alias Kala in what capacity did he work for you? What? Who is he? We don't know any Kala. Interesting. Very interesting. Okay, so Gagandeep, you tell me, where were you on 15th March? I... listen to me... - No, not you. So Gagandeep, where were you on 15th March? I was in Delhi. Hmm. So, how did you go to Delhi? I mean, by train, plane, or car? - Mr Chauhan! I mean if you went by train or plane, you must have bought a ticket. And if you traveled by your car your car number must be on the toll tax you paid. Hmm? Okay, so you saw everything. Yes, I saw it with my own eyes. Goga killed the ASI. Gagandeep, alias Goga Taliwal which gun do you have? Sorry? I mean, you've a license of which weapon? I've only one licence, of a .32 bore. The one with which ASI Balwinder Singh was killed? I don't understand. Anyway, forget that. We've all that information. Greetings, brother-in-law. I'm in Vikram Chauhan's office. He doesn't believe anything we say. You talk to him. Okay. Here, take. Speak to him. Who is on the line? - My brother-in-law. Who is your brother-in-law? - Deputy CM. Greetings, sir. I will do my best, sir. Yes, sir. You think he'll save your brother? Not even the prime minister can save your brother. Hey listen, mister! Stay in your limits. Don't try to act smart. Or many like you... - Or what will you do? Bloody man! You dare to threaten me? Goga, don't mess with him. - Get out from my office! Let's go. No problem, we'll deal with you! And yes, Sucha Singh, your brother is a doomed. It may so happen that even you may go to jail for dealing in drugs. A copy of this file has to be submitted in court tomorrow morning. Right, sir. I want to watch the two brothers' pride crash. Have some snacks. - No sir, thanks. Come on, have some. Right, sir. Senior officer of Harayan cadre, IPS Vikram Chauhan died in a road accident last night. Vikram Chauhan was investigating the murder of ASI Balwinder Singh. The accident happened while he was travelling alone from his office to the guest house. As per high court orders, Vikram Chauhan was investigating the murder of ASI Balwinder Singh. Some people are eyeing this accident with suspicion. There are many rumors over whether this incident is an accident or murder because Vikram Chauhan was going to submit his report to the court today. Yes? - Take this. Maybe it is of some use to you. Who are you? - Good day, sir. Deepi, take a look at this. This is the file containing all the evidence that Vikram Chauhan gathered. It's clearly stated here that Goga murdered your dad. Really? I think we should take this case to the media. We cannot wait until morning. I think we should leave immediately. You stay here, I'll go and get the keys. Hello. - Hello, darling! How are you, huh? It's me, Goga. How could you dare to call me? Ahh! You speak so sweetly! I swear to God... I truly love you since a very long time. It makes no difference to me. You can get engaged to that England return guy. But you know you'll go on a honeymoon with me only. Stop your nonsense, dog! I've all the evidence that Vikram Chauhan gathered against you. If I don't expose you by tomorrow... I won't consider myself worthy of my father Balwinder Singh! Who is it? Who? Who is it? - Goga. Why did you have to tell him? Those guys are very dangerous. Let's hurry now. Hey, stop! - Stop! Where are you going at this hour? We are going to the city, we've urgent work. Get off. What urgent work do you've in the city that too, in the middle of the night? After the murder of DSP Deepak Dogra terror has spread in the region. The police is searching every corner although they haven't got any breakthrough in the case. It's like the dog trying to catch its tail. The murderer killed the deputy and escaped. He analysed the whole story with a cool head and the fired the shot. Yes. - This guy is a real schemer. You are right. Jagra, what do you think? Will this guy be caught? Listen, the police is looking for the culprit high and low. But he won't be caught. He's a sharp shooter. - You're right. Sir has come. Sir. The investigation is on. We've laid our hands on very strong evidence. We will nab the culprit soon. Yes, sir. Sir. How are you, Khan? - Good, sir. Your preparation is good, Khan. But be more vigilant at public places. I've already placed my men in civil clothes at bus stands and railway stations. Good job, Khan. Well done. The police have found no clue yet on the murderer of DSP Deepak Dogra. The eye witnesses said that the murderer entered the public meet dressed as an old man spoke at length with the DSP and then shot him dead. Hello. How are you, Goga? - Who is this? Your right hand man got killed. You may be next. Are you scared? Who are you? Which right hand man are you talking about, huh? The same. The one who is currently in the news. You bloody man! Who are you? Tell me your name. You don't know who you're messing with! I know you very well, and also your brother. Next in line is your brother Sucha Singh. If you dare to touch my brother, I'll... Okay! Is that so? Then I'll put you next in line. You both have to die. Hey you bloody... Hello! Hello! Bloody hell! If he mentioned Dogra and if he mentioned the murder of Balwinder... Singh before killing Dogra... I'm sure he's some close relative of Balwinder Singh. Sir, our sketch artists have prepared this picture of the man who shot DSP Dogra on the basis of description given by eye witnesses at the scene of crime. Yes, Khan. But as per reports, this man mentioned the murder of ASI Balwinder Singh before firing. Sir, both these cases are connected. After the murder of ASI Balwinder his daughter Navdeep and her fiance... Ronnie Brar disappeared suddenly. This is their picture. They'd complained that the ASI was shot dead by MLA Sucha Singh's brother Goga. But it was his driver, Kala who went to jail. NRI Ronnie Brar and the shooter look very much alike. Well done, Khan. If this man is really Ronnie Brar who can be his next target? MLA Sucha Singh or his brother Goga? ^Damn the government of Punjab! Hail the united procession of farmers! Damn the government of Punjab! Please remain silent for some time. Please calm down, brothers. Listen to me, please. Calm down. You will always be hailed. I've come so far to ponder over your demands. The government has put me on the duty of understanding your problems. I myself am a farmer. I understand your problems, I understand them well. Give those false assurances to others, Mr MLA. Either accept our demands or go away from here. I've come here to listen to your demands and consider them. ^Punjab's MLA Sucha Singh be damned! At least give me an opportunity to speak. What opportunity do you want? We've been sitting with our wheat crop in the market since so many days. No one cares. ^They say out wheat is wet. Not our wheat, sir, our eyes are wet. Brothers, this problem isn't of the state government. It needs to be addressed by the central government. If it has to be addressed by the central government, why are you here? Go away! ^Punjab government be damned! Let's go. They cannot be helped. Punjab government be damned! I've had enough. Beat them up! The dangerous killer who murdered DSP Deepak Dogra at a public meet in Gumtali a few days ago was arrested by the police today. According to senior police officer Sandeep Kapoor this dangerous criminal had come to Gumtali's grain market with the intention to kill MLA Sucha Singh. He was arrested from the spot. The culprit has been identified as Ranjodh Singh, alias Ronnie Brar. Shall I come, bro? - No, turn and keep the car ready. All right. Hey England return, you survived? Huh? You claim to be wise, but are you in your senses? Have you lost your brain, huh? Listen did you really kill Dogra? But you had threatened me. How weird! Now what? What will you do? Want me to do some other service to you? Don't worry about me, worry about yourself, Goga. The day I am released you guys won't find a place to hide. - Really? All right, if that's the case even I won't kill you. I will keep you alive. This is just the lock up. You'll go to jail from here. And you'll rot there all your life. I won't repeat the mistake I made the first time. I am not the old me anymore, Goga. This time you're pitted against a Singh, God's soldier. Oh, my! Stand back a little. Stand back! Or just a blow of this lion's paw will injure you. Oh-oh! The wise man is mouthing dialogues? That too, plagarised from Pakistani films? What do you think? Drinking sweet water has turned you into a lion? You call God's elixir sweet water? Leave him! Leave him! Bro, want a smoke? What wrong did I do, bro? Be thankful I didn't shoot you. Bloody fool! Let's go! Ranjodh Singh, ASI Amandeep Singh from the crime branch has come to meet you. Ronnie, what's going on? Did you kill Officer Dogra? Tell me, where is Navdeep? You look good in that uniform. Where is Navdeep, Ronnie? The file that Vikram Chauhan had made we got hold of that file after his murder. Deepi and I were travelling to the city with that file. But on the way, Deepak Dogra ambushed us. Your prey is before you, sir. I have brought them to your feet. Do what you wish with them. If you heed me, just finish them. They won't be able to cause you any more trouble then. Well done, Deputy. You've done a good job. You're always there for me in my difficult times. Do me one more favour today. Sir, don't burden yourself with the favour. Just keep rewarding me and the burden of favour will reduce. All right, I'll leave. You'll get your reward. My younger brother will deal with this. Don't trouble her so much. Be nice to her. I'm Goga Taliwal. If I keep my hand even on stone, it melts with my heat. But you you are so stubborn. You caused your father's death first. Now you'll cause the death of your fiance. Be prepared to die, you dog! Dheera, look at her courage. Goga wants to make you his Juliet. But I think I'll have to use force with you now. Only if you live! Ronnie. Deepi. Dheera. - Yes, bro. Go throw their bodies into the canal. - All right, bro. Before that, shoot this hero. All right. Dispose their bodies. - Come on. Deepi is finished. - Throw his body too. But brother said to shoot him first. Oh, yes. Shoot him. Go on. Shoot him. Listen, you fools. Don't let brother come to know that we missed shooting him. Or he will shoot us dead. The rascal is going to drown and die anyway. Oh, God hope they both drown and die. After being unconscious for many days when I regained consciousness... I found myself in an unknown place. This place was actually an ashram that promoted Sikhism. One of their men had saved me from drowning. Baba Shingara Singh was the chief of this ashram. And thanks to one of the doctors of this ashram... I soon recovered. Are you all right now? - Yes, I feel much better. Just a little pain in the leg otherwise, I'm fine. Sit down. The medicine is working, I can see the improvement. Greetings, Ranjodh. - Greetings. I had recovered physically but mentally, I was under trauma. Son, you shouldn't feel sad looking at the setting sun. The sun that sets today will surely rise tomorrow. I've no interest in anything, Babaji. I'm feeling very depressed. I think dusk has come into my life forever. No, son. Until your heart beats and time runs nothing comes to a standstill. Although, in the dark of disappointment one often feels like that. When will the darkness in my life vanish, Babaji? Son, read the holy book, listen to the sermons. God's word will eliminate all your doubts. God's word guides you and shows the way. There is elixir in God's word. Men must obey God's word. Then God takes care of everything. Mr NRI, how are you feeling? Oh. I'm fine, Babaji. Greetings. - Greetings. Babaji has sent these clothes and some books for you. Thank you. - If you need anything, just tell me. Babaji has put all responsibility of the ashram on me. All the others are young. Thank you. I'll leave. - Okay. A month had passed since I'd been living in the ashram. Babaji inspired me to fight against injustice. But I had no courage left to fight. I wanted to run away. But Babaji had answers to my every question. His words stirred my conscience several times. Answer my question. If it was someone else in your place. First of all, one must not use weapons. But if faced with injustice learn to take revenge. You must teach your tormentors such a lesson that no one dares to mess with a Singh again. You mean, I must pick up weapons? I should kill those who did injustice to me? You want me to become a terrorist? Son, one who fights injustice isn't a terrorist he's called a warrior. A warrior! Now you have to decide whether you want to become a warrior for those sinners or like a coward, find excuses to run away from responsibility. God's soldier never torments the helpless but also doesn't spare the tyrants. Look son, even if you lose your life while punishing that tyrant consider it to be your good fortune. Because in God's court, a martyr is always rewarded. He achieves greatness, who dies a martyr. Glory be to the lord and his men! ^Glory to the lord! Glory be to the lord and his men! Brother Ranjodh, come. I am feeling very restless, Babaji. An anger rises within me. I want to take revenge, Babaji. I want to take revenge. Do you have that strength in you? That's my question. Will I be able to fight them all alone? Baba Banda Singh Bahadur, Baba Deep Singh... Bhai Pichatar Singh read the history of these men. You will find your answer. That is what I don't understand, Babaji. What made these men so tough? They'd the courage to fight a million and half men singlehandedly. All these warriors became soldiers of God born from God's symbol, Khanda. And before that, they were all normal Sardars. God's elixir gives one strength to rip apart a sword. This elixir turns cowards into brave men. It gives a sparrow the courage to fight a vulture. Give up your doubt, become a soldier of God. Learn to use weapons. Take rebirth as God's soldier and defeat the sinners. "Born from the Khanda, he's strong like the Khanda" "This God's soldier wears the God's symbol" "Born from the Khanda, he's strong like the Khanda" "This God's soldier wears the God's symbol" "He is the brave son of the tenth Guru" "He has blessings of all the Gurus" "Born from the Khanda, he's strong like the Khanda" "This God's soldier wears the God's symbol" "Born from the Khanda, he's strong like the Khanda" "This God's soldier wears the God's symbol" "His weapons are his ornaments His every sinew oozes sacrifice" "In this meaningless world he has found a meaningful life" "He pounces like an arrow released from a bow" "And rips apart the chests of his enemies" "Born from the Khanda, he's strong like the Khanda" "This God's soldier ears the God's symbol" "Born from the Khanda, he's strong like the Khanda" "This God's soldier ears the God's symbol" "He hits his enemy from the skies" "He is determined to fight" "He has God on his side" "He enemies drop in pieces in the battlefield" ^Glory be to the lord and his men! "He leaves behind time, years Only his sword speaks" "When the enemy doesn't listen to reason He has to pick his weapons" "This is the only principle of my generation" "And he lives by this principle" "Born from the Khanda, he's strong like the Khanda" "This God's soldier ears the God's symbol" "Born from the Khanda, he's strong like the Khanda" "This God's soldier ears the God's symbol" Until I'm with her, my sister can never lose. Brother, truth has immense power. Just support me and we will fight them. Sir, NRI ranjodh Singh has escaped from prison. The dangerous criminal who killed DSP Dogra... Ranjodh Singh, alias Ronnie Brar has escaped from police custody. Ranjodh Singh was in the police lock up of Gumtali from where he managed to escape through the window. Hello. Hmm. Is it? I'll look into it. Sheru, take the car to the river. I need to drink. Get the bottle from the car. - Hurry up! Bro, he's escaped again, hasn't he? This time, I will kill him. Bro, will we drink with no accompaniment today? Let's go to the hotel, we'll eat fish. We don't have to go anywhere to eat fish, Dheera. You'll get to eat fish here. - Really? Of course. Let's see now whether you eat fish or the fish eat you. Resignation? What is this Amandeep? Are you mad? You know how you've got this job. That is why I cannot carry the burden of this uniform any longer. "There was a boy." "There was a boy." -Waheguru! (Hail Lord) "There was a boy." -Waheguru! (Hail Lord) "He was sleeping." "Uncles and their nephews." "Uncles and their nephews." -Waheguru! (Hail Lord) "Uncles and their nephews." "Uncles and their nephews." "Listen to me." "Listen to me." "Listen to me." Don't just stand there, go and make way for us. Can't you see how late we already are? "They have made sweets." "Nephews are brave boys." "He is unstoppable." "His spirits can scare any enemy." "He shines like a star. He is immortal like sun." "He was born to evict the wrongdoers." "Hail this brave man for killing a monster." "Hail this brave man for killing a monster." "Hail this brave man for killing a monster." "Hail this brave man!" Has the demon been cremated? You rascal! You killed my brother. Killing others is a game for you. Now you realise how precious life is? Just confront me once! You rogue! You're playing in hiding. If you really are God's soldier confront me in the open. It is your turn now. And I will confront you openly. Who was it? No one. It's a testing moment. I'll know now who is stronger. Goga, it's very important to act sensibly. I suggest you leave this place for some time. Now, lives will be at stake. Either he will be dead, or I. Mr Wiseman, you always mouthed big dialogues. What had you said? 'Goga, you're pitted against God's soldier now.' What do you have to say now? Who is stronger? Remember Baba Deep Singh, who, despite all odds, kept his promise. Thank you for reminding me. God's soldier cannot even die unless he permits it. You are nothing, Goga! "Hit the target." "Give your best to win." "Try harder." "Try your best!" "You are brave." "You are the protector." "Evict the evil." "Yes. Yes." Times change. Ways of life change. But principles don't change. Even today, the soldiers of the tenth Guru tread the path of Sikhism fighting the evil along the way and helping the helpless. Until cruelty exists in this world such warriors will continue to fight the battle of truth and rights. ^Glory be to the lord and his men! "We play with death" "Like we play with a toy" "We are thankful even on a bed of thorns" "We don't demand a bed of roses" "We are brave like lions" "With a broad chest!" "We are soldiers of God!" "The motorcycle is like our horse, the gun is like our sword" "The motorcycle is like our horse, the gun is like our sword" "A Singh changes with changing times" "He always fights cruelty and injustice" "He is ready to die for truth" "He always fights cruelty and injustice" "He is ready to die for truth" "He keeps the promise given to the tenth Guru even sacrificing his life for it" "The motorcycle is like our horse, the gun is like our sword" "A Singh changes with changing times" "Sinners commit sins and pay for them" "History is witnss to this truth" "Sinners commit sins and pay for them" "History is witnss to this truth" "They are red blooded and injustice makes their blood boil" "The motorcycle is like our horse, the gun is like our sword" "A Singh changes with changing times"
