Could you please repeat that? A little slower, please. Sorry! What would you like? A café au lait, please. Very well, Miss. And a glass of water, please. Right away, Miss. - Watch the thorns. - Okay. No need to look at the camera. This cut's done. Thanks. What's next? Ready to go? I'm sorry, please give us a moment. - Satoshi. - Yeah? It's past 12. You need to hurry. Okay. - We're here. - Oh, good morning. - We're ready for you. - Sorry we're late. - Hello. - Thank you for waiting. Please get ready. Hey, listen. That guy is the one who photographs Shingo. No way. Shingo? All set. - We're ready. - Alright, let's get started. Positions, please. A little more this way. Good. Thank you for today. - Excuse me. - Yes? You take all of Shingo's photographs, right? Yeah. If it's not too much to ask, I'd love your autograph. LEARN FROM SHINGO PHOTO NOJIMA Thank you so much. Please leave a message at the tone. Hello, Shingo? It's me. I have something important to tell you, preferably in person. Call me on my cell when you can. - Yeah. - Morning. Were you awake? I'm just about to leave. Did you make sure to have breakfast? Are you going to have time to come home before leaving for France? I don't know yet. You don't? Listen, Nanao-- Sorry, Mom, but I have to go. I'll call you later, okay? REFILL WATER CANADA Shingo's on vacation from today? Yeah. - Say Nojima... - Hm? Did you hear from Shingo yesterday? Nope. I see... What is it? It's just... Well... Well? Thing is, yesterday... Sakurai, did you send the fax? No. - Well, send it. - Okay. Satoshi, a word. Come here. You told Shingo about Canada, right? Not yet. Seriously? - Why not? - I've been busy with things. Satoshi? Yes. - Where are you? - Here. Come. Scumbag. MEN TAKE IT BLACK Shingo's landed his first lead. In a movie? Filming starts in January. Next year? You're doing the stills. What? You see, Shingo's a bit shaken. What with that last TV drama getting poor reviews... He's completely lost confidence. He gets oddly tense on set. You know, he really can't do this without you. Whenever you're there, he's relaxed. I can't. I told you I'm going to Canada after Shingo's next photo essay. I want to photograph landscapes, not people. I know that. I completely understand. How's this, then? Put off Canada for a year. No, just six months. And I'll help get your first book of Canadian landscapes published. No, I couldn't... Look, Satoshi. Shooting Shingo's photo essays is what allowed you to go pro. And why did you do it? Because you and he are close buddies. Couldn't you do this for your friend? I'll talk to publishers about getting your landscapes published. Hey... We need to decide on a cover photo and contact the publisher today. I hear you. I'm off to Mountain Valley Publishers. Hold down the fort here. Mountain Valley? They specialize in nature photos, right? - Cut on an angle. - Okay. Did you hear a strange noise? Huh? Oh, that. Hey, Yamaga! Yes? You're doing clearance today, right? Yes. Here. Thanks. Throw them out. - All of them? - That's right. But they're still in bloom. Why not give them away as a free gift? Look closely. The flowers may be fine but look, the leaves have withered. They'll droop the moment someone takes them home. I've told you before, don't judge by just the flowers. Make sure to inspect the leaves and sepals as well. Disposing of flowers is also part of a florist's job. Here. I'll take them home. What? Welcome! Good afternoon, sir! Do your thing, Nanao. Okay! Nanao! Coming. Your mild bitter blend, just as you like it. Thank you for always making this. You deserve it. - It looks great. - Drink up. Okay. So you want an arrangement around snapdragons, right? What's your budget? Very good. We'll deliver it to you. Thank you. - Hey, Nanao. - Yes? Go on home. You have a big test tomorrow, right? It's fine. You mean the NFD test? Level 1? Yeah, that's the one. Wow. That'll get you a flower designer's license. So scat. This is your last chance before going to France. Yes, well... okay. If you insist. - Rest up. - Have a good night. THE 30-SOMETHING WORKING WOMAN Good evening. No bag. Thank you. Out of 200 yen? Seven yen is your change. Here you are. Your change and your receipt. Thank you. Come again. SHINGO 1ST PHOTOESSAY PHOTO: SATOSHI NOJIMA Good work today. - You... - Yes? Want to try photographing Shingo? Who, me? Yeah. You two seem close. Shingo's got potential, but his expression is always a bit stiff. Then I saw him with you and thought, "That's it!" I'll do it. Please let me try. Sorry. Huh? Satoshi Nojima? How do you do? I'm Akane Ueda. - H-Hey... - Can I check something? Hey! What're you doing?! Shingo? Shingo? No, not in there! Stop! Shingo! Why isn't he here? Shingo... Focus, focus. Shingo? No... He's not here. Why would he be? Come on, don't cry. Look, pipe down, alright? These walls are paper thin, okay? Do you know about me and Shingo? Safe to say I do now. I'm three months pregnant. You don't believe me. Wait. He gave me this. It's a souvenir from Canada that you gave him a long time ago. I don't remember that far back. Okay, then here! Look at this! Your high school rowing championship! Shingo's dad donated the oars from his boating company. And his dad took this picture as well! Right? Right? See! I knew it. That settles it. I'm staying here until Shingo comes back. What? I'm not sure why, but I'm sure he'll come here! Says who? Well he told me that you're his only friend. What's more... it's your fault he's gone. What? How is it my fault? Never mind. - I'm beat. - Wait, huh? I'll tell you all about it tomorrow. I'll take this room. Hey, hold on! Give me a break! And so I too Gather the wind Gather the wind She spent the night. I need to go. Morning! Shingo has one just like this! Here... Here you go. Come on, take it. Here. That's good. Right? Shingo taught me. Thanks. Why don't you have any photos of Shingo up? Never mind that and explain all this to me. Why's it my fault that Shingo's gone? Oh, you know why. Huh? This right here! You didn't tell him about you going to Canada. He was really upset by that. You see, I wanted to surprise him. I wrote I was pregnant and put it in a fortune cookie. I waited, but he was too drunk to notice, and the next day, both he and the cookie were gone. Who was it? Who told Shingo I was leaving?! Figures it was you. Don't let the boss know. I'm sorry. What's wrong, Sakurai? If Nojima leaves, what'll happen to Shingo? He'll quit modeling, won't he? Shingo always says it's Nojima or nobody. And I doubt anyone can photograph Shingo like Nojima. Yes, I wonder what will happen. Aren't you at all worried about Shingo? Of course I am. But this is a problem for Shingo to work out. Here, Ishida's profile. Send it out. Right. THE BIRTH OF A NEW GPS Shingo. Please leave a message at the tone. Hello, Shingo? I need to talk to you alone right away. Call me. It's empty. Oh, I'll try this. ONLINE SUPERMARKET What are these? Bath time! Splash! "Silver Prize"? "Satoshi Nojima." You came so close. How was the exam? How'd it go?! My corsage turned out pretty well. JAPAN FLOWER DESIGN ASSOCIATION EXAM Nanao? What's up? My exam finished earlier than I expected. Take the day off then. - We can manage here. - Hello. But... Go enjoy yourself. I've got to go now. We have a customer. - Over here, look. - What is it? This is what I've been wanting. - About design? - Yeah. That one's better. But it's so expensive. - But definitely better. - Buy it for me, then. Please? Hey, it's Nanao. I just couldn't stay away. I can see that. Take a load off. You've worked hard. Do you really not have a boyfriend, Nanao? Where's this coming from? I mean, you had a day off yet... Yamaga, mind your own business. Now we await the result, and then it's off to France. Yes. Thanks. - And for you. - Thank you. Well? Feel relieved? A little. Bottom's up. Excuse me. Yes? Looking for a bouquet? Yes... um... Your mild bitter blend. Thank you. You look exhausted. Was work hard? A bit. Do you have any particular flowers in mind? With a budget of 5,000 yen, we can make something quite nice. I'll leave it up to you. I don't know much about flowers. Let's see... It's a gift, right? Yes. For a lady? Yes. Do you know her favorite color? Hm, her favorite color... Um... What color do you like? Who, me? Yes. I guess I'd have to say yellow. Yellow it is. What? Are you sure? Yes, choose the flowers that you like. All right, then. Actually, it's my first time sending a woman flowers. I've yet to speak to her, really. Do you think that's weird? What? Do you think she'll be bothered by getting flowers... from someone who's a near stranger? It's hard to say. She'll certainly be surprised. But I don't think there's many women who would object to receiving flowers. I'm glad to hear that. I don't want her to think I'm a stalker or something. A stalker? I want to do this right. I'm embarrassed to say it, but I've never felt this way before. Every time she comes into my store, I feel my heart race. It feels like fate. Wait, you work at the convenience store near the elementary school. Yes. So this lady must be a regular customer, huh? Actually, yes. I see. Here you are. Good luck. Please... accept these. Here. For you. Look! Come here! Ta-da! Looks great, huh? I didn't know what you liked, so I made my specialty. What about the door? I never left a key. I was able to do everything from here. Look. ONLINE SUPERMARKET Ah, did you notice? I found it while I was cleaning today. It's such a great shot of him! No, don't! I can't relax with this. Just while I'm staying here, okay? Relax. Dinner's almost ready. Why won't you believe me? I find it hard to believe myself. It's not a question of... whether I believe you. I know he'll come here. Fine, okay. Where else is he likely to go? Nowhere. Come on. A favorite date spot or something. A restaurant maybe. There has to be some place. Like I said, there's not. We've never gone out for a date or went to a restaurant. Hey... You just doubted me. That look says, "There's no way they're dating." We meet at his place. It's not easy for him. His popularity's waning. One scandal and his career is over. He was paranoid about that, so I would try not to leave his place. Why the grin? I was thinking how that's very like him. He takes you prisoner. He's not holding anyone prisoner. You said so yourself. I do it because I want to. He's never asked me to do this or that for him. Same with you. You wanted to photograph him, right? It was your choice, right? It's the same thing. Please... accept these. Here. For you. Hello, Miss. It's a pleasure to meet you. Hello, Ma'am. It's nice to meet you. My name is Sophie. Welcome to France. Do you have your passport? You don't look well. I've got a cold. Do you have a fever? No, I don't have a fever. Gather the wind Gather the wind Morning! Good morning. Oh, did I wake you? You did it on purpose, didn't you? What's the name of that song? Hey, do you know? "Gather the Wind." You know it? Nope. Didn't think so. Why do you know it? We sang it in junior high chorus. Could you stop acting like we're friends or something? Oh, that reminds me. Your neighbor's pretty cute. Wait, have you never seen her? Why not? She's real cute! It'd be awkward. I think I understand why your girlfriend dumped you. Here you go. What do you want for dinner? I'll make anything you like. What do you want? Name it. - Flash. - Okay. - Again. - Okay. Lower it. Lowered. Here's a test shot. - Again. - Okay. Nojima, the boss is here. I heard about Shingo. That idiot Sakurai. It's not something he could keep quiet. I know. So, there's still been no word at all? Dammit. What if he refuses to do the movie? Boss, I... Oh yeah. I found a publisher who's interested in your Canadian shoot. Really? Mountain Valley. They're the best. You should be happy. Mountain Valley, huh? Hurry and contact Shingo. Tell him you're postponing Canada. I'll handle the rest. This is for both of you. Where's Sakurai? Don't know. Do you know where Shingo might go, Yukari? Anything, please. I've got to get in touch with him. You took that offer. Of course. Mountain Valley specializes in landscape photography. It's my chance. Thing is... you won't escape this way. Know why Mountain Valley agreed? It's because you're Shingo's photographer. The boss will just put Shingo's face on the inside flap. Make him write the postscript or something. He sweet-talked them and twisted their arm. Don't you see that? Whatever. I don't care about that. You're really sure about this? This is for both of us. I mean, Shingo's over 30. He can't go on modeling forever. This movie is his big chance. Shingo doesn't want to act. That's why the boss is so desperate. He's forcing it on him. Just stop. Stop using him as your scapegoat. - Makeup. - Yes? - Could you fix the hair? - Sure. How about baby's breath? Oh yes, that would be lovely. It makes it look cute, right? And how about adding this? Thank you very much. Take care. Sorry I'm late! What's with your head? It's a vigil. A vigil? I was so moved seeing that customer confess his feelings for Nanao yesterday. So I confessed my love for a girl. Turns out she's been in the hospital and I can't see her until she gets out. What? You didn't know she was hospitalized? I've never seen her. We met online. But I'm nuts about her. This feeling is the real deal! Like that man said, you don't have to know a person well to fall for them. It's true! So please, Nanao, seriously consider his feelings. Oh, welcome back! You're late! Satoshi, you reek of alcohol. Come here! Look! Here! Ta-da! Your favorite, dumplings! I didn't know what type you liked, so I made all different kinds. I'm excited to see if you like the fillings. Don't tell me you spent all day making these? I sure did. Are you impressed? Unbelievable. Huh? Isn't there something you want to do with your life? Yeah, there is. Then do it. I am. What, is it your dream to open a dumpling restaurant? Of course not! I want to wait for Shingo's return. The cooking's a bonus. That's such bull. What woman makes a hobby of waiting for someone? Shingo's my hobby, silly. What's gotten into you, Satoshi? What I'm saying... is... don't lie to yourself. I'm not lying to myself. - You are. - I'm not. You are! You're afraid he'll resent you if you do your own thing, so you hold back. I've got no idea what you mean. I'm tossing these. - Ow! - Why are you here? Why are you in my house? Why not wait at his place? Let go. It's self-doubt! You doubt he'll return to you! That's why you're here! I said let go! When you doubt yourself... there's no place to go. - Excuse me. I'm with a delivery service. - Yes? These are the Musashi Apartments, correct? Akane! I'm sorry, but is there a Tsukada here? Yes, the landlord. First floor. Forgive me. I didn't mean it, Akane. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I had too much to drink. I'm sorry... I am. You even made the dough. You don't see ones like these. Here goes. Don't force yourself. No, it's good. Really. Delicious. Thank you for this food. It's good. Real good! How can you even tell when you're inhaling it? What's in it? See, you have no idea! What's in this? Bitter gourd. How's bitter gourd blue? You need to enjoy each flavor. What's in this one? Chives. ...along a meandering path I see over... spotted dewdrops A streetcar clattering past sleepily The sea comes into view Akane? Coffee's ready. Akane. Shingo. Shingo. Akane. I know you're there. It's not because of what you said. I want to show you some place. Hello. Are you okay? Yes, fine. You didn't come by the store yesterday so I got worried. I brought you this. See ya. Hey, wait! Thank you, Mr. Himuro. This is it! This is the place from the photo! Come here, Satoshi! Wow! Take my picture. Seriously? Like this, right? No, just stand normally. Like this? - No, face front. - Oh, like this. Okay. Ready? - You're forcing it. - I'm not. - You're too tense. - I'm nervous. Smile. - I'm nervous. - Be natural. Natural? Just relax. Here goes. Okay. I often come here, and close my eyes like this. That way, I hear things I don't normally hear. Do you know what a keynote is? A keynote? Yes. It's often used to describe the sound of a landscape. Like the wind, or the din of a crowd. You usually don't even notice it, but it's always right there, and when it's not, you feel like you're missing something. Familiar keynotes have a soothing effect on people. A heartbeat, for example. Heart sounds. Heart sounds? Yeah. You've heard how babies relax when they hear its mother's heartbeat, right? I sometimes think... even as adults... people are looking for a keynote within themselves. But that sound is not easy to find. And even if they do find it, they tend to disregard it. I mean, it's not something you can see. And you can't explain it rationally. It makes it difficult to tell someone about. That's why... sometimes people refer to it as "destiny." Sounds cliché, I know. You really like taking nature photos, don't you, Satoshi? Yeah. Why? Shingo often said... "It's not my photos or magazine spreads that Satoshi wants to shoot. It's landscapes." He'd always say it was his fault that you couldn't do what you want. That's not true, right? I told him, "One look at those photos and it's obvious. Satoshi enjoys taking them." But he didn't believe me. Just like when I said how I liked staying at home with him. So he often tried to take me outside somewhere. I wanted Shingo to believe you, too. So I vowed not to leave his house. I see. On that day... The night that he disappeared... He came home real drunk. He was devastated... that you didn't tell him first. As buddies would. As his friend. Was it because of Shingo that you didn't go to Canada? No, it wasn't. It wasn't because of him. I'm glad. Sorry. Welcome back. Where's Yamaga? Well, that girl he likes told him what hospital she was in, so he left with this huge bouquet. Ah, to be young and in love. No hesitation. Tell me how it's going with you. There's not much to tell. I told him I was going to France, so a relationship would be difficult. And? He said he'd wait, right? I would never expect that. Nanao, why not indulge yourself a little more? If you wait too long, you could end up like me. I'd be happy to end up like you. I used to think the same way. "SCHOOL CULTURE FESTIVAL APPROACHES" SATOSHI NOJIMA LEAVE FOR FRANCE! HAJIME HIMURO Grind, grind, grind. Grind, grind, grind. Where in Japan are you from? I come from Tokyo. How do you like France? It's very beautiful. Have you been to the Eiffel Tower yet? No, I think I'll go there tomorrow. Huh? Yamaga! What happened? Ow, that hurts! I've been trying to get my hair to grow back quickly. But why? Did something happen? It was all a lie. Her illness, her hospitalization... I feel like an idiot for getting so worked up. I guess there's no such thing as destined love. Nostalgic scenes from high school? Yeah, to go behind his bio page. A layout change, huh? I want to end with images that speak most to both of us. End? But is there time? I'll shoot them tomorrow. Tomorrow? I'm looking at them. No, nothing from me. Okay. Bye. Boss... you got a minute? Sure. It's about the movie. Oh, our deal? What about it? I'm afraid... I can't do it. I'm going to Canada. You sure? The offer from that publisher might never come again, you know. I know. But... I want to try to earn that chance on my own merit. I see. Okay, then. I'm sorry. Don't be. You won't get to the top by apologizing to people like me. HAJIME HIMURO Excuse me. Oh, yes? Welcome back. Nanao, is something wrong? Sorry... I... I got it! FLOWERTAIL: A LONELY WOMAN IN HER 30S May I leave early today? Of course. But are you okay? Did something happen? I'm fine. Got a minute? Here. This is going to print tomorrow. SHINGO TO RETIRE "Retire"? The boss is so twisted. He told me not to tell you until tomorrow. What's he thinking? Since you said you'd be on a shoot all day tomorrow... I felt you ought to know. You going to Canada isn't why Shingo disappeared. He's been planning to take over his dad's business. It wasn't my fault? Is the boss angry? Not at all. In fact, he seems relieved. I guess even he felt a little guilty... for turning Shingo to modeling against his father's wishes. Say... Does the humming girl still live next door? I see. Well, I'll be going. Good luck tomorrow. I expect good photos. Yukari. Thanks. For everything. Good evening. Welcome! Ms. Nanao. I read your novel. Mr. Toru Ogawa. You're a real jerk. Cover for me. Wait! Ms. Nanao! - Hang on! - Stop! What are you so angry about? You put my private life into your book. And you gave it your own interpretation. You have to admit it's accurate. "All her time is occupied in the pursuit of a dream. Romance is out of the question. But in truth, she's afraid to pause. She's afraid of love. She fears being hurt by it." Who're you describing?! It's you. It's your inner voice. How'd you get this anyway? Oh, was it that woman who helped me write about an unfaithful wife? "Helped"? You used her. She didn't help you. Yeah, but if she hadn't made such a fuss about it online, I would have never gotten publishers interested in my writing. Just listen to me! Know what they said? My novels lacked realism. You need realism to make even a good story sell. But, the only way to know how women react to realism is to test it out in the real world. That's no excuse. Ten years. I left home with big dreams... working part-time as I wrote. I can't give up now. I'm over 30. No one will hire me. How do you know? They might. But not this. It's too bad. I thought you of all people would understand. Me? Think about it. In the name of becoming a professional flower designer... how many flowers have you sacrificed? It's the same thing. You and I are the same. I... I am nothing like you. What would you like to drink? I'd like some wine. Yes, of course. What's for dinner tonight? We're having rabbit tonight. I brought a friend. Long time, no see. How've you been? I'm fine. How about you? I've been fine. I've... I am... fine. Gather the wind Gather the wind Gather the wind In hopes of taking to the sky That big sky Passing through the dawn I see over... a deserted pier I see the city raise its scarlet sail And lower... its anchor And so I too Gather the wind Gather the wind Gather the wind In hopes of taking to the sky That big sky A morning without people I bide my time at a coffee shop Hello? I see. Shingo returned, huh? Yeah. He read my fortune cookie. He knows about the baby. CONGRATS, SHINGO PAPA! - AKANE MAMA Shingo apparently went home to talk to his dad. He's promised to be Japan's best daddy. I see. That's great. Thanks, Satoshi. And I'm sorry... for being a pain in the ass. It's okay. Give my best to Shingo. I will. Work hard, Satoshi. I will. See ya. Noborikawa residence. Hi, Mom? Pretty. Congratulations! - Oh my gosh. - Ta-da! Thanks. I plan to follow in your footsteps so help me out. - "I'll do my best, too." - I will. Okay, good. I'll work hard. We often hung out here. Hey, Hashimoto! Satoshi! - How've you been? - Good! Look at you, man. You've put on weight! No, I haven't. It's been so long. Hey, come here! Nojima? Take the bike, too, please. Thank you very much. Hi. It's been a while. Nice to see you. Hello, Ms. Noborikawa. - How's your husband? - Fine. Working hard. Yes, he's just fine. I'm glad. Hey, brother. Nanao! - I'm home. - Welcome back. I'm here! Welcome home! Why didn't you tell me? Your father said not to. Still... I started to tell you on the phone, but you seemed real busy. Keep mixing. I hear you passed your exam. Yeah. Keep taking good care of those flowers. Yeah, I will. This is my last round, Dad. Oh, come on. The family's all together for once. He's kicking. - Can I touch? - Go ahead. Finish your dinner first. What bad manners. I felt him! He's got some spunk. He's a sprightly one. Wow. The doctor says it's a boy. Nanao... telephone. - For me? - Yeah. Hello? Hello... um... This is Satoshi Nojima. We were classmates in junior high. Yes. Nojima? You probably don't remember me. I'm calling about the thank you party for our teacher, Mr. Miyaji. A thank you party? Yes. He's retiring this year. And tomorrow's his 60th birthday. So we're combining the two celebrations. Tomorrow. It's been so long but I thought I'd try calling through the telephone chain. The telephone chain? I'm not sure if I still have it. Do you have your yearbook? Yes. That's the order. In that case, I can probably make the next call. Great. - Well... - How are you? What? How are you? Yeah... I'm good. That's good. Do you think... you'll go tomorrow? I'm not sure yet. What about you? I was asked to take photos at it, so yeah. I see. Well, I'll see ya. Okay. MR. MIYAJI THANK YOU PARTY Hey! - When did you get back? - Yesterday. Really? Why didn't you call me? What is it? Nanao! - No way, it's been forever! - Keiko! - How've you been?! - Good. You? Fine. How long's it been? Yo, Satoshi! Nice to see you, man! How've you been? Takahashi. Lookin' pretty spiffy there. Look, it's Noborikawa! Thought she was in Tokyo. Have you seen her there, Satoshi? No, I haven't. No? What is this? - Thanks for being the photographer. - No problem. - Pro bono, right? - Says who? You're paying. We gather to honor a man who has helped shape our lives, and pay tribute to a long and distinguished career! Mr. Miyaji! And today, as it is also his 60th birthday... Hey, isn't that Nojima? He never stood out much in school, but I hear he's a super successful photographer in Tokyo now. You know Shingo? The guy who just retired? Shingo? Come on, you live in Tokyo! Don't you keep up with stuff? Shingo's like this super elite male model. I'm sure you'd recognize his face. - Ready? Move in closer. - Closer? That's good. On the outskirts of town I strolled down the mature alleyways Man, that takes me back! Excuse me. Can you take our picture? Everyone ready? Move in a bit closer. Yes, good. That's it. Okay. Thank you very much. Everyone ready? - Yes. - Look towards the camera. Everyone say, "Job well done." One, two... Job well done! She moved. Shingo. I came to return my key to the realtor. Your mild bitter blend. There you are. Thank you. When do you leave for France? Tomorrow morning. You be sure to come back and visit, okay? I will. Thank you. - For this as well. - Drink up. - Here you go. - Thanks, man. Akane says hi. I owe you for that. How is she? Good. This girl's cute. Easy there. - You went here? - Yeah. Hasn't changed a bit. Not the lake. But the area around it has. That's true. You went, too? Before seeing my Dad, I had this urge to go there. Are you sure this is what you want? Yeah, I'm sure. I want to keep rowing. I used to dream of becoming like my dad one day. I want to play with my kid. Be told "Dad, you're such a pain," yet still be home each night for dinner. Pretty boring, right? Yeah, it is. - Thank you. - You're most welcome. No, no. It's on the house today. Thank you. You're welcome. Oh, wait! I have something for you. A farewell gift. You always look at it. I couldn't. That's okay. It was taken by a local photographer. I'm sure he'd give me another if I asked. Here, use this bag. Thank you. Maybe you know him. He lives in the apartments by the beauty salon. What? That's where I lived. You've probably seen him then. PHOTO NOJIMA "Nojima"... He's not home. He's not here. Was it around here? You remember. That's right. Right here. May I? Make it good. You're so old now. Screw you! What about you, man? - Here goes. - 'Kay. That's it. Okay. You still got it. This place doesn't change. Give me your camera. So who's that girl? Nobody. - Sounds like a lie. - Back off. You had all those photos. It's nothing. Get away from me. Why are you so close? I haven't taken one yet. Here goes. And so I too Gather the wind Gather the wind Gather the wind In hopes of taking to the sky A morning without people I bide my time... at a coffee shop I see over... a cracked glass How the pavement fills... You make crepes with buckwheat? Yeah, they're called galettes. The lady at my lodging in France taught me. - You didn't eat them in Canada? - Nope. Oh, that smells good.
