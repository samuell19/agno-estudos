They say all our dreams have meanings. It's like our subconscious mind is trying to tell us something. They say we dream every time we sleep. Last night I remember... I saw you. You're facing away from me. Alone in the middle of the ocean. Gazing out to the sky in front of you. Then suddenly you disappear... Just like that. ♪ Like a thirsty deer ♪ ♪ that misses Your flowing river ♪ ♪ My heart cannot bear ♪ ♪ this waiting for You ♪ ♪ Like a barren field ♪ ♪ that waits for the rain to come ♪ ♪ My soul waits for you ♪ ♪ O Lord ♪ You guys are from Jakarta? Is it just the three of you? Yes. Your son seems to like taking pictures. Yes, he's a photographer. I see. You know those pre-wedding photoshoots that people do? They're all the rage in Jakarta, people get married every day. I see. So... If he gets married himself, he'll have to take a selfie? Sorry. What's important is the person he's getting married to. Of course. We can only pray for him to find a good match. Amen. You've come to the right place to find a match. Haven't you guys heard about the deer on the beach? It's what the area's known for. Where can we see it? It's actually quite rare. The locals here believe that if you see the deer, it's a sign you've met your soulmate. I personally believe that's in God's hands. But let me tell you the local myth behind it. Long ago, there was a man and a woman. They fell in love with each other. But it was forbidden. The brave yet reckless couple ran away and planned to meet on this island. The man made it here, but the woman never showed up. The man remained faithful, however, waiting for the woman until his death. And what about the deer? So, rumor has it, that the deer was actually a reincarnation of the man. It's called a myth for a reason. It's just folklore. Yes, and we are Christians. We only believe in Jesus Christ. That's right. But we also believe those coconuts are going to be great! Sure thing. Thank you. Let us pray. Dear Father who art in heaven, we thank You for Your grace and the blessings that You have bestowed upon us for our holiday here. May we use it as a time to get closer to You... Tim... Tim... Tim! What? Nothing. Take off your sunglasses. I want to see your eyes. Doesn't it hurt? Why don't you try it yourself? As if. Here. Didn't hurt, right? Do you think I'm some kind of old playground? At least I didn't do it here. Or here, or here. Or here. It tickles! Now I've tagged you like a cow. It's a mark of ownership. Timmy... Stay here with me. Don't go away. Tim! Come take a photo, don't just stand there. - You want a picture? - Yeah. One, two... It'll be dark soon. Let's get back for evening prayers. And I still have to cook dinner, let's go. You guys go on ahead. Why? I want to take some photos over there. We should all stick together. I'll be fine, you guys go ahead. No, let's stay together. I still have to cook. That's why I said to go ahead. It's fine, look how close it is. Tim, why are you being so stubborn? Come on! We want to have dinner together. I do too. I just want to go over there first. It'll be dark soon anyway. It's fine, Dad. I'll only be a minute. Come, we're on holiday together! You need a shower too. I've been at the beach all day, it's normal. You're sunburnt already. I'm fine. I'll just be a second. Let it go, Tim. Mom, it won't take long. Why are you so stubborn? I just want take some pictures! What's so wrong with that? Come on, honey. Let's go. Five minutes. Our Father who art in heaven, we are gathered here today to give thanks and worship You for Your grace and the blessings you have bestowed upon us and for giving us this holiday as a time for us to get closer to You. You, the Lord, know all of our son's struggles and his mourning. Father, only in Your power, do we believe and have faith that Tim will become... a man, who is... normal and perfect. A man, who can overcome his sexual disorientation. We believe in You, Father. You entrusted Tim to us to be the best he can be. May You banish the devils that control his heart! May You guide Tim back to the righteous path! Your love and Your light, Father. We give our thanks. We pray. Amen. Alone in the middle of the ocean. As you gaze out to the sky in front of you. Amen. Do you believe it, Tim? The theory about dreams? I'm just happy to see you. Even if it's only a dream. But I hope... I'll still get to see you outside of my dreams. Tim? Tim? Tim.
