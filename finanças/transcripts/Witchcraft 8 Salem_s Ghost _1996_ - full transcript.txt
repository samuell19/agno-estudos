[music playing] [singing] [shouting] Witches and witch-mongers is notably detected. The wickedness of conjurers. The piety of [inaudible], and the folly of soothsayers! The infidelity of ours is the pestilence. [shouting] The abomination of my god-- [shouting] The power of natural which has long lay hidden, now is very necessary to be known! [shouting] Such the dark may be pure enough to be my perfect servant of Satan! [chanting] Symbol of [inaudible] universe. I summon thee! The virtue and power of natural magic long lay hidden, now is very necessary to be known! Set me on the glowing flames of my torch! I hereby sentence Thalus, the warlock, Simon Renfro, son of Satan, to be damned for eternity! [screaming] [screaming] Hey! Hurry, you fools, or his evil will spill into your souls! Well, what do you think? It's enormous. It's old. So is the whole neighborhood. It's perfect. We could never find something like this in California. It's all ours. And it's gonna take us months to fix this place, Sonny. You don't like it? I know it was a bit rushed, but we-- we got it for a steal. There's plenty of room for guests. And look, a yard for your garden. It's got everything. This is the kind of house we've dreamed of, Sonny. Maybe we should have bought the condo instead. They don't make 'em like this anymore, Mary Ann. I mean, this is a house with history. And so I'll lead you to more research? It's a house I can romance you in-- in the middle of the night. Sing ballads of love. And promise. Make babies. Hm? I'm sold. Come on. Sonny? Help me? Here I am to save the day! [screaming] Sonny! Oh, Sonny! Sonny! Shh. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Shh. Shh. His color was gone. His breathing was shallow. Just like last time. I'm OK, Mary Ann. Tell Dr. Smothers I'm OK. Right. All right. Thank you, doctor. You know I hate shrinks. They think they know everything. Well, he said you're gonna be just fine-- if you stay out of small spaces. I'm a nut case. Just say it. Claustrophobia is hardly grounds to commit you. But I do know what we can do for your therapy. [bang] What is that? I don't know. I'm going to find out. Sonny? [gasp] Oh, you scared me. Yeah. Look at this. Let's get outta here, huh? Yeah. Since witchcraft is such a prominent way of life in Salem, it's worth discussing how the fear of witchcraft began in Salem colony, as well as in this country. Now, for centuries witch hunts had been occurring in Europe, but in old Salem it was still folklore until the last decade of the 17th century, when the Reverend Samuel Parris had employed as his housekeeper a West Indian slave woman. Tituba was her name, and she regularly regailed groups of enthralled girls with vivid tales of voodoo spells and witchcraft. When the reverend found his 9 year old daughter and her 11 year old cousin flouting about in convulsions, their only answer was they were bewitched. The good reverend believed it to be Tituba casting spells on innocents, and because of this one man's fears a mass hysteria was created, culminating with what we know to be the witch hunts. In the years to follow, thousands of innocent victims were senselessly tortured and slaughtered. [buzzing] All right. I want you to read the writings of Judge Briley Wilford, chapter seven. Professor Dunaway, hi. Hi. Cathy Wilkins. I just want to say how much I enjoyed your lecture. I think your class is going to be the best one all semester. Well, I'm glad you think so. It was nice meeting you. Oh, so dumb. You'll be joining a top notch faculty here, Dunaway. And in two years, you could be eligible for tenure-- pending all goes well, of course. Of course. I don't need to tell you how many qualified applicants we've considered for this position. And in spite of your little coed situation in Merrimont, your reputation stands clear. Your commendations were top drawer. So we're holding high expectations for you, Dunaway. I trust you've, uh, settled? Yes. Uh, we found a wonderful place up in the Chestnut Hill area. Chestnut Hill? I see. Well, I certainly hope you like it here in Salem. We do so far. Now then, uh, you'll be reviewed on your instruction framework and your ability to generate a creative environment. Of course, you've heard all that before, I'm sure. Well. Good luck, Dunaway. Thank you, Dean Simpson. I appreciate the opportunity. Howdy, neighbor! How the hell are ya? We're the Bakers. The Bakers? From next door. I'm Mitch. My wife Gayle. Hi. Sonny Dunaway. We just moved in. Yeah, we know that. Been waiting all day for you to get home. Won't you come in? Honey, our neighbors came to visit. Oh. Hi. I'm Mary Ann. Hi, I'm Gayle, and this is my husband Mitch. He's a plumber. Oh. A plumber. Best in town, and don't you forget it. Boy, they sure don't build 'em like this anymore. Hell, it is huge. It's real big, Mitch. Well, we don't have much furniture yet, so-- Oh, we know how it is, sweetie. So Sonny, what do you do? I'm a teacher at Salem College. Ah. A professor. So, professor, you got yourself one hell of a fixer upper here. How are the pipes? The pipes? The plumbing, man. A place like this ought to have all kinds of skeletons. Mitch is the best. Mitch's plumbing. You got a leak, we got the plug. Aw, leaks spring up all the time. Some just blow fittings, main lines. Hell, sometimes the whole system backs up, and water just starts seeping into the foundation. I did notice a leak, actually. Ah-ha! I knew it. Ah, I can smell a leak on the other side of the city. Attic, right? Basement. But, uh-- tell you what I'm going to do. For a housewarming gift, I'll do a free inspection of your house. Now, what do you think about that? Well, I don't know if all-- He is the best. I think it's a great idea, sweetie. An afternoon, tops. OK. What could it hurt, right? [giggling] I dunno. Looks like a cracked pipe. You're going to have to replace, uh, this length through here, and-- oh, ho, ho! This wall's gotta come down. Now, wait a minute. There could be a gushing flood back there. Now, you know what they say. You pay me a little now, or you pay me big time later. But you said-- Trust me, Sonny. Mitch Baker knows what he's doing. The last people who lived here only stayed for two days. We thought there was something wrong with this place. Well, we did hear some strange noises. Really? We bought it from the Protestant Church of England. That's kind of weird, huh? Oh, I get it. That's a joke, right? Ha ha! You are so cute. God, you two make such a perfect couple. We've had our share of rough times. We moved here to start over. Ah, how romantic. Well, Mitch and I never fight. Well, there's no reason to, cause he's such a wild bronco in bed. Ah, hee hee. Any children? We're waiting for Sonny to get his tenure position. I wonder what those two are doing down there. Mitch, let's talk about this. Yeah! Son of a gun! What is it? Looks like a door of some kind. Whoa! Must be some kind of back draft or something. We heard that same noise last night. Thirsty, guys? Hee hee. That hit the spot. Thanks, snookums. What are you doing to the wall? Ah, Mitch just found a door. A door? A door to what? Well, pretty lady, that's what we're about to find out. Ah-- another time, OK? Just let us get settled first. Well, you're the boss, Sonny. Oh, I'm sorry, Mary Ann! I was just trying to help! That's OK. Mm. Not bad. Well, maybe Mitch would like to take some home with him. My grandmother cans them in Oregon. They give Sonny heartburn. Do you have any idea what used to be here back in old Salem? Hm. Looks like an old cemetary. Oh, pumpkin, they just moved in. I'm getting hungry, snookums. Let's go feed the hungry tiger. Mm. If you all need anything, just holler. All right. -Bye bye. -Bye. I'll be back. Thanks for the warning. They mean well. He'd probably tear down the whole house if I let him. Did it ever occur to you that he might be right? He's a plumber, and you're not. Slap me if I ever start calling you snookums. Hm? Well. May I have this dance? Love to. [buzzing] Oh, brother. Morning. Hi. It's the big day, honey. Rise and shine. [doorbell] The dean wants creative? I'll give him creative. Hi. Come on in. Thanks. Hi, professor. Whoa! Awesome, dude. Way cool. It's beautiful. It is beautiful. Wow. Beautiful house. I made these myself. Oh, uh, honey, look. Uh, this is Cathy. My wife, Mary Ann. Please turn to chapter six, page 147, the works of John Adams. Now, he was known as a controversial and outspoken writer in his time. Everybody found a place? OK. [banging] I apologize for the racket. Mary Ann? [banging] Be right with you. -Hungry, anyone? -Yes. Yeah. Yes. Oh, ham sandwiches. Great. -Thank you very much. -You're welcome. -These look great. -Gosh, thanks. Thank you so much. Mm-hm. What are you doing? Hey, give me a hand, will ya? Mitch, I'm teaching a class upstairs. Well, I know that. I didn't want to disturb ya, so I came down on my own. Hey, check it out. Holy cow. Looks like a pentagram. You know, a witch's hex mark? This could be a historical find. Stand back. We're going to open this baby up. Uh-- Mitch, wait. Come on, we're already here. All we have to do is open it. Heh. You ain't chicken, are ya? All right. Oh, come on. All right. Let's brace ourselves. Let's get it best we can. OK, 1, 2-- [coughing] It's cold. MARY ANN: Sonny? Everyone's waiting. Wait for me. Well, it's a man's job now. Oh! Oh, I can't see! I can't see. [inaudible] Well, I think Professor Dunaway is so cute. He's definitely cool. He is so intelligent, and in charge. I like that. So does Cathy. She's got a thing on him. How do you say that? Oh, please. It's only obvious. Oh! OK, well thank you very much, people. Thank you so much. I had a great time. Take care. Excellent questions today. Tre cool, professor. -OK. -Bye, professor. Bye bye, now. Can we do it again? But of course. I had such a great time. Thank you. You're welcome. Professor-- do you mind if I call you Sonny? Professor. You've inspired me so much, I've decided to take American Lit as a major. Could we meet and talk about it? Well, how about Thursday? 2:00? Perfect. Bye. Bye. What? Don't you play innocent with me, Sonny Dunaway. That girl has a crush on you. She wants guidance. Mary Ann, we both know it would be over if that happened again. I couldn't live without you. You're the only woman for me. Just so it stays that way. Mitch? Funny, Mitch. What a beauty. You mean you took this from their basement? I didn't take it, I found it. And they'd never know it was there if it weren't for me. Exactly where did you find it, Mitch? I don't know. Some kind of, uh, crypt, or something. A crypt? As in graveyard? You mean to tell me you took this from a grave? Oh, Mitch, how could you? You know all sorts of curses come from this stuff! Curses? Don't be ridiculous. Look at it. It's priceless. The, uh-- doctor is ready for his exam. Nurse is ready. Any swelling? Oh, temperature's rising. Let me check your pulse. Cough. [coughing] [laughter] [moaning] Mary Ann? Honey? I'm home. Honey? I'm home. [shouting] That is not funny at all, young lady. Come here. No, no, no. Come here. Look what I found in the library. Look. It's our house. What's it say? This house and others in the vicinity were built by the Puritans. Witch burnings sites were in the Chestnut Hill area. Charming. Oh, there's nothing to be afraid of. That was over 300 years ago. You're like a little boy with a new toy. [screaming] [laughter] Ah! [laughter] Sonny! Sonny! Oh my god! Damn. Wait. Tituba was a fascinating woman, and she wasn't a witch, I assure you. -Thank you. -OK. -Thank you. Thank you. Now I understand. Profesor, do you have a few minutes? Uh-- sure, Cathy. Let's go to my office. What happened to him? It was a joke. A fraternity prank in college. I did my thesis on Hamlet, and, uh-- some of the guys thought I should have my own skull. That's where I met Mary Ann. Maybe we should have that talk. OK. Well, what would you like to talk about? Well, about how you wanted to ask my advice? You know, I feel there might be something going on between the lines here. You seem very tense. Don't worry. I won't bite. You have very strong hands. I have a confession to make. Look, I'm happily married. I'm going to be late for my next class. Can we have our talk later? OK. Looking forward to it. [screaming] Honey! What's wrong? Help me! No! Help me! Mr. Dunaway. Clarence MacArthur. I'm from the Protestant Church of England. I've come to tell you a few things about your house. Maybe you can tell me what the hell is going on here. Mitch! Open up in there! Mitch, what are you doing? Mitch! Open up in there! What are you doing? Mitch! Fred is here! Mitch! Mitch! MItch! Fuck you, Mitch! Ain't she grand? Isn't she beautiful? What do you think, Fred? Hey. Oh, yeah. She must be 150 years old. Even more. So what do you think she's worth? About half a mil? Whoa there, buddy. Listen, let me take it to the shop. No! No, it stays right here. I'm not letting it out of my sight. Nobody needs to know about this, Fred. Nobody. Jeez, Mitch. All right. Relax, guy. Uh-- where'd you find it? Never you mind about that. I'm counting on you, Fred. Oh, OK. I'll go to the car and get some things out of the car. What the hell is it? When I learned the clergy sold this house, I came as quick as I could. Their shortsightedness could very well have killed ya. OK, MacArthur. Just say it. I'm afraid something terrible has occurred here, Mr. Dunaway. Something of great magnitude with incomprehensible ramifications, not only for you and for this house, but for the entire world of Christianity. You shouldn't have opened the crypt, and you shouldn't have taken the cross! Crypt? You mean to tell us there are people buried down there? Look, we just want to know what's going on. I'll tell you what I know to be the truth. 300 years ago, during the witch hunts of Salem, a vile warlock, a wretched and evil man by the name of Simon Renfro, accused of murdering and ingesting countless children, raping more than a dozen women, and forcing them to black witchery, was desecrated on this very ground and buried in what you know to be the room off your basement. His spirit was encapsulated in a grave-- an earthly prison for all eternity. And he was to stay still so long as Salem's cross lay nailed to his coffin. And that's the cross that you're talking about? Aye, that's the cross that's missing. You mean to tell us there's a warlock loose in our house? A warlock's ghost. More powerful than the physical. He can travel and shapeshift at will. This warlock has many powers none of us can imagine. Fascinating. Sonny! This isn't some game. Whatever it is, it is trying to hurt us. Aye. You're fortunate I arrived when I did. Pack up your things and go. Hey, we're not going anywhere. We bought this place, lock, stock, and barrel. Sonny! Maybe we should sell it. No way. I'm not afraid of some ghost. How do we know he isn't just some con artist? Or maybe it was just an earthquake. This is hardly a time for denial, Mr. Dunaway. But you can call the church and verify what I tell ya. It's dead. The process has begun. He will sever all ties with the outside world, and keep those he chooses as his mercy. Did you remove the cross? No! It had to be our neighbor. He's the one that opened the crypt to begin with. Ow! That was weird. So, uh, what do you think? What do you think it's worth? I don't know. About, uh, 80,000, give or take a few thousand. No, no, no. It's worth more than that. I mean, look at her. Hey, hey, you just take her somewhere else if you don't like that figure, OK, pal? Now, you just tell me where you found it and why you're acting so goddamn weird, huh? In the backyard. I-- I dug it up. Oh. Backyard? You're not gonna tell anybody, will ya, Fred? Not if you don't want me to, Mitch. You sure you're going to be able to make it to the poker game on Friday, buddy? Huh? OK, all right, already. Hey, listen, are you sure you're going to be able to make it to the game on Friday? Mitch? Poker Friday. This folklore is fine and all, but you've got my wife scared to death. Listen to me. Renfro has the power to possess bodies at will. We must send him back to the damned before he escapes this house. OK. But don't we want the warlock out of the house, instead of keeping him in? The security of a few hardly outweighs the souls of many. Great. How do you know all this? The witch hunter who entombed Renfro in 1692 was me ancestor. I am his legacy. And you too, Mr. Dunaway, will become a witch hunter. I think you're assuming a little too much here. Knowledge is responsibility, sir. A note worth taking. This is crazy. A witch doctor shows up and tells me my house is haunted, and now I'm helping him catch a ghost. Hunter. What? I'm a witch hunter, not a doctor. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. Now, very important. What are you afraid of? I must know. The warlock will use it as his weapon. Nothing I can think of. And what is it you do for a living? I teach at Salem College. Call in sick for some time. I just started. I can't do that. Time is critical. Renfro will try to escape when he learns what is occuring. Not afraid of nothing. What are ya, Superman? Jeez. MacArthur, wait a minute. Wait a second. -Oh, just stop. I don't want to hear nothing more from you. [screaming] Are you all right? That son of of a bitch. I'll kill him! He was having sex with you! Honey, you're scaring me. That fucker is in my attic! Oh, god. Come out, pumpkin! Please! Mommy wants to play! I've got breakfast for you! I miss you! I think it's better this way. No way. I'm not leaving you here alone. I'm not! Just how many of these witch exorcisms, or whatever you call them, have you done? I've been training for this my entire life, if that's what you're prying for. Well, you sure don't act like you do know what you're doing. It's just temporary. I-- I assure you. So how many have you done, MacArthur? Tis me first time. Terrific. Hi, professor. I heard you were sick, so I brought you some of my homemade chicken soup. Won't you come in? Professor. Call me Sonny. What are you doing? You want it as bad as I do. Why else did you come here? I told you, I brought you some-- [moaning] [screaming] [screaming] Cathy, what are you-- [screaming] We haven't much time. That poor girl was no doubt the victim of Renfro's diabolical tricks. She's fortunate she still has her life. It's ready. Place and fix the coins between your lips. It'll ward off any errant magic. This device will warn us of the warlock's presence. Remember, no matter what his tricks may be, maintain thy will, and God's spirit protects us. Falter, and you invite the beast inside. [chanting] I am the dark lord. Who is he who calls me forth? Remain firm in your belief! Fear not, and he has no power. None, witch hunter. Descendent of he who committed my soul to the living dead. But you underestimate me, and my powers. And the clever apprentice. You are not wanted in this house! In the name of God, I command you to return to your-- [laughter] If your almighty be so vast in his love, so colossal, so magnificent, then why all your starvation and disease? The war. What sort of god is this that forces his children to suffer? And you, groveling before this impotent master for forgiveness of thy sins. To worship, and to never see! Does your god come to you in your dreams? [screaming] [howling] What's with that book, anyway? Oh, Malleus Maleficarum. The medieval witch hunter's grimoire. The cover is made from the skin of a witch. You see, the end of Salem's cross is a special dagger made by a 17th century alchemist. You must get close enough to the warlock without being caught by his eyes, and plunge the blade into his heart in another. This will incapacitate his spirit so that we can condemn his soul back into the earth. You don't seem too worried about Renfro wasting you. No. I am protected by this. It's as old as Salem's cross. It was passed down by me ancestors. It's my responsibility to seek out this doppleganger and destroy him. I'll incur no harm with it in me possession. You'd better brush up on your incantations, because with the fireworks this ghost dishes out, your cross won't do squat. What is that? Shut up. It's not working. Well, what do we do? Find out who or what is in there. Ha ha ha ha! Dammit! We need Salem's cross. He's turned into someone I don't even recognize anymore! Ever since he found that stupid cross! [crying] Is this it? I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? I didn't actually see it. That be the cross of Salem's glory. Please, be careful, Tis over 300 years old. Who's this joker? Our local neighborhood witch hunter. Our real estate agent. Are you guys making a spook house over there, or what? There's no time to waste! We must have the cross back this very moment. You're messing with state evidence, pal! If you don't like it, I'll run your ass in, too. You're making a terrible mistake! Just don't give up your day job, MacArthur. Hey, let's get a drink. OK. I could use the company. Come with us. We've an enormous amount of work to do! You cannot leave! Oh my god. Mitch! What the hell? [laughter] [laughter] Yes, master. [laughter] Yes, master. Yes, master! [screaming] Stop the beast. Use the cross. Me? I don't know what to do. Thrust it into his heart! Fear not, and he has no power. Don't go in there, Sonny! Look what's happened. It's got to end. Let somebody else do it. We could just leave. Now! If I don't do this, nobody else will. Call the police. I'll be back in time for dinner. No! No! No, it's too dangerous in there! [screaming] Were you looking for me? Ha ha ha! No! No! No! No! Ha ha ha! No! [laughter] [screaming] Sonny? Mary Ann? Get out of here! [screaming] Mary Ann? Get out of here! MARY ANN: Help! No! No! Your fears are my delight! [screaming] Sonny! Help me! Mary Ann! Mary Ann! Yes, that woman will be my slave forever. No! Angels and ministers of grace, defend us! Get away from her. You will join her in the depths of darkness. Go back to Hell. [screaming] [music playing]
