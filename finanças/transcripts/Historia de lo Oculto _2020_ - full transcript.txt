No doubt this is going to be a rough week for President Belasco... ...with the official 1987 Budget Announcement. That's why in exactly 7 days we'll have the presence of the economist Nelson Finkel. To answer any questions regarding Argentina's economic future. Also, we'll have a word with Marcelo Cataldo key witness in the ArfenMed Records Trial. Will Deputy Bengoa, from the National Renovation Front... ...dare to share the table with him? For now... we've run out of time. We wish you a very good night... and hope to see you next week, when we meet again... ...'60 Minutes before Midnight' LS89 Transmiting. Channel 6. Across the country. Get on your feet and come with me! Right now. HISTORY OF THE OCCULT I was starting to think you weren't coming. Von Merkens sends you this. What is it? Von Merkens's stuff. It's all explained inside, on a paper. He says your friend who went to the farms will know what to do. -Did you send anyone to the address I gave you? -Yes. - She should be there already. - Do you have any more leads for tonight? Federicci. Nothing new. We have A and C. But we're still missing B. We're leaning on what Marcato will say live. Do you believe in Marcato? Some of us do. Others don't. Well, you better make up your mind. Unless you want to waste your chance tonight. Do you believe him? I believe that if you are clever enough to make him really talk... ...avoid him from his regular delusional nonsense. Then he can give you enough material to knock Belasco... - ...and his whole team over. - We're not going to knock the President over. I mean, it's not necessary. The Elections are a few months away. Belasco has all the public opinion against him. There's no way he'll get re-elected. Let's pray on that. Will you watch the show? We have a flight at 10.30pm, we'll be flying. What? You're leaving? We'll try. We were hoping that you-- That Von Merkens... would give us something more. Von Merkens' sources are dry. I already told you. Now it's all in your hands. I understand. It's almost 9pm. - Ok, I'll see you around. - I doubt it. Wait! - There's something more. - What, Federicci? It's getting late. There's a thing. I can't get it out of my head. A phrase, I don't know if I heard it somewhere... or if I dreamt it. But I think it could've been said by Von Merkens. The future is over. What does it mean? There's no double meaning, Federicci. It means that if you blow it... ...it's over. - Natalia. - Sorry, I just got here. The taxi ride took forever. - Did you get off early? - Yes. ...a few blocks. - Did anyone follow you? - No. - Are you sure? - Yes. I'm sure, professor. Any news? Nothing for now.And I don't think there will be for a half hour. - Are you nervous? - No. Not much. - Did Dani gave you-- - Yes. Do you remember how to use it? Yes, professor. I remember. - Should I call again in fifteen? - Be careful. You shouldn't have sent Natalia. She's too young. And has no experience. ..children of 6 and 7 years old. Who weren't registered as part of the hostage group. At the same time there's a desperate attempt... ...to capture the second aggressor, who wasn't on the crime scene when the police stormed in the bank. Carlos. Griselda. Back to you. Thank you, Marcela. On other news. The expectation keeps growing ...around the gathering called for tonight at midnight... against President's Belasco economic measures. This is the first time a rally is called at this atypical time. The Ministry of Defense recommended not to go out tonight. A high attendance is expected for the 'Midnight Rally'... ...as it's been popularly named over the past few days. Channel 6 will surely offer, from tomorrow noon, full coverage... on everything that envolves this protest. Now, we leave you in the company of '60 Minutes before Midnight'. We'll meet again tomorrow... ...a few minutes before 9pm, when we come back with a new... 'Flash 6'. Seeking for peace and quiet? Find them by visiting 'Malvinas Islands'. A national treasure located in the most southern spot of our country. Find out about all our current offers. This is a message from the National Tourism Department. It's starting. This is a message from the National Tourism Department. LS89 Transmiting. Channel 6. Across the country. This show is sponsored by Von Merkens Laboratories. At your health's service since 1930. Good evening. And thank you for watching us. As you may know, this is our last show. The constant threats, and the drop from practically all of our sponsors... Plus the network's final decision... ...prevent our continuity. And if we're here today... It is thanks to Von Merkens Laboratories. Which not only allowed us, but assured us... ..our last whole hour on the air. We hope to make honor to that gesture tonight, by being able to achieve our mission. The one we've accepted almost a year ago, when we started investigating one of the biggest stories... but also one of the darkest we've ever covered. A story we're hoping to conclude... for the last time, and like every week... within the next... 60 Minutes before Midnight. 9 months ago... Manuel Ramirez, a guard at Ensenada's Seaport... while doing one of his rounds... found a dead and desecrated body. At first, Ramirez declared that he got to see the killer. Or at least the one who was trying to get rid of the body. Then he contradicted himself. And then he died. The body had no identification. After a few weeks, when no one reclaimed the body... he was declared 'John Doe'. And his remains were reduced and dropped in a common pit. A few months after Ramirez's death... ...one of my former students reached out to our producers. Jorge Federicci. Federicci met Ramirez before he died. And got a little more information. Back then, Ramirez confessed to him he kept a souvenir from that night. Something he didn't give the police. This notebook. He told Federicci that the man he found on the seaport... ...disappeared right in front of his eyes. Leaving the notebook behind. And that he had kept it as proof to himself... ...that he wasn't going crazy. That what he saw that night was actually real. It's a personal notebook. Half journal, half binnacle. It has many parts written in code. And others that appear to be in a language that neither me or my team... ...were able to identify. Unfortunately... Neither Federicci, nor my regular team... ...are in the studio with me. Since we started investigating the leads on this notebook... ...we've been constantly discredited. Threatened. Pursued. And from this week on, fired. Nevertheless, here we are. We are still here. Come on, old man. 60 Minutes before Midnight. Tonight, our guests are... Senator of Rio Negro Province, Matias Linares. Responsible for the new National Identification System Law. Daniel Aguilar. Sociologist. And author of the recently published 'Michelle doesn't remember anything'. Finally... Adrian Marcato. Vice-President of the Kingdom Corporate. The company with the fastest growing rate in Argentina... ...in the past decade. Two of our three guests tonight appear on Ramirez's notebook. We've invited them to our studio. So that they can help us bring light... ...to what's on that notebook. We'll take a short break. Be right back. General review. We're not in college anymore, Lucio. The old man will interview Linares first. - Marcato is supposed to react immediatly. - And what if that fails? - Then Aguilar goes in. - And if that fails? - Then I go in. - And if that fails? The old man will read the four points from the file. - And Marcato is supposted to confirm them. - What four points? One. Marcato met President Belasco in college. After graduating, they co-founded Kingdom Corporate. Nevertheless, Belasco doesn't appear on any records. Two. Kingdom funded Belasco's campaign, and his image of a bussiness man disguised as a regular man. Three. Kingdom also funded many operations in favour of the goverment... and against the opposition. Four. The notebook links Kindgom Corporate... Belasco's main economic source... with the Seaport hitman and many trending politicians. If we could make Marcato confirm all of this... it would force Judge Biasotti to read the files and open a case. First he would have to answer our calls. And if that fails? Nothing. We lose. If all else fails we go with Von Merkens' plan. That's right. I forgot. The adventures of Natalia lost in the suburbs... - ...and the plan we know nothing about. - It's OK. Great job. Maria. Classes finish after midnight. - Were you followed? - No. - Has is started? - Did you change cabs? - I came walking. - From downtown? By bus. Then walking. - Has it started yet? - The old man just blessed us live. Amen. They went to commercials, you didn't miss anything. He said it was our last show, and introduced Linares, Aguilar and Marcato. He mentioned you. - You're the star of the night. - I brought you this. It's from Von Merkens. Here. Be careful. - Did he read the report? - Not yet. I hope he realizes it's ridiculous. I doubt that. You don't believe this part of the story either. Why didn't you convice him not to do this? He would've listened to you. He has a soft side with you. I don't believe in everything he does. But I believe in him. Besides, this is our last hour together. And I owe it to him. They're coming back. I'll go make some coffee. Before we start, I want to read something. In the course of this investigation, like many others we've done. I always ask the team I work with... ...to write daily journals describing every detail... ...of their experiencies on the case. Developments, new informations. Or just a record of their personal impressions thougout the experience. Thoughts that firsthand don't seem significant... can turn out to be as important as an official statement. The report I'm holding is signed by Eduardo Alonso. It goes by the regular style and habits... and was placed among the rest, in the open file we carry of the case. Nevertheless, this report has two singularities. Eduardo Alonso was never part of this team. On the other hand, this report describes events that never happened. You don't believe any of this? 'I keep having nightmares every night. I already wrote about them some time ago. But they never stopped. Today we went to see Senator Linares with Maria. His name appears in Ramirez's notebook. I suppose some of that kept ringing... because in the dream I was in the same place. But without Maria. Maria. I can't. I'm watching the coffee. In the dream. As in most of the times... the corpse from the seaport appears... Maria. ...gathered with other people I think I know. Maria. They're looking at some papers. They seem worried, but also satisfied and proud. After saying goodbye... ...each one goes their own way. The John Doe takes a cab. Maria. Where are you, Jorge? Maria. Now the John Doe is me. I see and feel everything that he sees and feels. The cab driver unsettles me. He takes a route I'm not familiar with. I don't remember what happens then. But I know it's uncomfortable. Maria. I'm in pain. Maria. I try to wake up. But I can't. Mari-- At the end of the dream, I realize that I'm on fire. In my mouth there was a taste of dirt... ...and ashes.' Any comments, Senator Linares? I remember our meeting with that girl, Maria. It was a few months ago. But she was alone. You don't remember Eduardo Alonso? Not at all. Yes. Hello. Hello? - If they know our number, they know our address. - Don't be paranoid, Abel. The telephones are always failling. Besides, if they knew they'd be outside already. You... Did you see anyone? It's a neighbourhood. With people. Yes but... did you see anyone that looked suspicious? I didn't see any warlocks. Is that what you're asking? Where's Maria? Maria. Maria. [Unintelligible] Is anyone out there? I'm locked in here. What are you doing here? I got locked in. - Yes, but before. - I don't know. I heard a noise. It must've been some neighbour. Let's go. Excuse me. Yes. Sorry. Senator, your phone number appears in Ramirez's notebook. Would you care to explain us why? Well, that's very simple. I'm a public figure. I'm a state official. My information is public. Because I work for the people. Yes, that's clear. Actually we got your number thanks to that. The tricky thing was getting a response from you. I work all day. Besides, I consider this eventful appearances in the media are more for the ego, than a part of my services. Senator. Do you know that man? Such bad taste. Do you know him? Yes, of course I know him. It's the John Doe. And don't you find it strange that your number appeared on his crime scene? I have no control over who has my number or where they write it. - That's public information. - And you don't you find it strange... that your phone number was linked to five other people? And that we have sitting with us, another of those mentioned in it. Adrian Marcato. Also known as Brother Darkness. Please don't. I don't respond to that name anymore. You can call me Adrian. I ask you to stop torturing him with your questions. - He can't remember anything. - Excuse me? No, excuse me. You were used for one purpose. And then completely erased. That's why as much as you insist. - He won't answer anything. - I was erased you say? Is this a joke? - Did 'Marcato's Show' started? - They erased him? You are just in time. Tell me, Senator. What's that number in the notebook? From the office on Pacheco Street. I don't have any office on that street. Jorge. Did you call me from the backyard? What? No. Don't bullshit me. Did you call me? No, Maria. What's with you? There it is. A Tabula Rasa. This man is insane. That doesn't prove anything. The fact that I don't know about a made up fact... doesn't mean that I forgot. Or like he says, that I was erased. - How many children do you have? - Why is that relevant? Two daughters. You have three daughters. - But you forgot because you gave one away. - What are you talking about? Sofia. Two years old. Her mother's smile. He has two daughters. Belen and Agustina. It's all in the files, you can check. You're an idiot. You're lucky we are on TV... - or I would erase your face with a punch. - Gentleman please. Calm down. I wasn't invited here to embarass this poor man that... has accomplished his mission. Let's do things right. You will start remembering a little more every day. Her eyes. Her mischiefs. But they're all going to be made up. The mind wants to grief but it can't. - You lost your daughter forever. - This is very disrespectful! I'm restraining myself out of respect for the audience. - Senator, please. - No. You know what, Alfredo? I don't know where you want to go with this lunatic... sitting here saying nonsense. But know that there's no turning back from this. And it wouldn't change if this wasn't your last show. Good night. After the break, Adrian Marcato... 60 minutes before Midnight. They say the future is over. What do you think about that? From the Child Protection Department... we've launched the 'For them for ever' Project. Centered on the main energy source that makes the world turn. The children. To join the inciative as a volunteer or making a donation... Good evening, how are you? Sorry for the late hour call. I'm looking for Judge Biasotti's personal phone number. My name is Maria. I'm a producer for '60 minutes before Midnight'. I'm his-- Hello? Hello? Hello. Could you listen to me for a second? Is it urgent? Commercials are about to finish. Yes, it's urgent. Von Merkens sent us a package. And it's important that you see what's inside, and listen to what I have to say. What I'm holding is tannis root. It's highly hallucinogenic and has a particularly fast effect. It's used for a very specific kind of ritual. On this paper... written by Von Merkens' hand, I presume... are the indications for the ritual. It's purpose... and a brief description of the side effects. What's the point, Abel? They're back on air. There's four doses. One for each of us. You put it in your mouth, and start chewing. It has a disgusting taste. But it works. What doses? What are you talking about? Lucio, did you know about this? It's fast but if we want to experience anything before midnight... - ...we should take them right now. - Abel, I'm fucking talking to you. Von Merkens gave us the address where Natalia is waiting for instructions. The way things were unveiling, we thought Marcato would give some clues... on air about how to procede. But I'm starting to think he has no idea... about where's that thing he wants. And it was Von Merkens' plan all along. - Did you read what he wrote? - No. But I'm starting to understand how our sponsor moves. Excuse me. But what does this has to do with our investigation? Tannis root is supposed to help you... connect with spiritual forces in certain clairvoyance ceremonies. That must be Von Merkens' plan. He thinks that this way we'll discover... - where Natalia should go. - I'm not doing that. It's ridiculous. - One less chance. - Less chance? For what? The only real chance we have is right now, Abel. With our last hour on air. And you expect us to do it on drugs. It doesn't work like that. I already took mine. And I'm still perfectly functional. 'Perfectly functional'? 9 months of work thrown out, validating some drug addict's delusion. This is insane. Von Merkens never let us down. So you agree with this? And you? I'm still considering it. I can't believe you're taking this serious. If you saw what I saw in the farms... - ...you wouldn't be so stubborn. - Enough with the farms! When are you going to tell me what you saw there? You stayed for 5 weeks, and you couldn't even get to Marcato. No. I refuse to consider this magical solution. I wish it was a solution. Or even more. I wish there were other options. I'm not taking it. Lucio. We won't all feel the same. Nor will we respond as fast. You'll probably start feeling weird very slowly. You'll hear things that aren't there. You will see things that... neither. But I promise it's a harmless experience-- Speak. Are there any news? Nothing yet, I hope there's news soon. - How's everything over there? - Fine. There's more movement but... Nati? Sorry. I thought I saw the same car twice. - Was it the same? - I don't know. - No, I don't think so. - What model was it? I have no idea. I know nothing about cars. - Start writing down the license plates. - Yes, professor. I'll call back in fifteen. Be careful. Marcato, I'd like to ask you what I asked Senator Linares. Do you know why is your name in Ramirez's notebook? Because it's a former partner's notebook. And were you still partners 9 months ago, at the time of the murder? No, I withdrew from the group about 2 years ago. Did you know who the John Doe was? I'm not sure, but I can sense who he was. Can you give us a clue? Maybe later. What's your relation with Kingdom Corporate? I'm co-founder and vicepresident. - But you're not attached to it now. - Yes. I chose to get some distance after we didn't agree on a certain matter. We'll get back on Kingdom Corporate later on. But I'd like to know a little more about your current occupation. Let me answer that, Alfredo. This man is the leader of an apocalyptic cult. Here with us is also Daniel Aguilar. Author of the book, 'Michelle doesn't remember anything'. Marcato is a con artist. He has convinced many people to follow him... ...under the menace that the world is about to end. I am not a con artist. I helped many people. With witchcraft? What? Excuse me? Of course. Those who follow him think he's a warlock. A real warlock. I have statements from many relatives of people who attended his farms. And say they came back different. Also declare that's what he hides in his farms. Witchcraft. Marcato is a warlock? You can call me that if you want to. This is certainly unexpected for us. We've had all kinds of guests, but this is the first time we have... a warlock. Could you tell us? Are you born a warlock? Do you learn how to become one? I was initiated when I was 7 years old. By my grandmother. She was a witch. - Your grandmother? - Yes, it was a holiday party. I went out to get some presents, as any kid would. And I found her completely naked. With her long gray hair down to her waist. She was standing on a circle drawn on the floor. And that's when she initiated me. We weren't as many back then. Not as many you say? Are there more now? Much more. Tell me something... Are there any warlocks in Kingdom Corporate? Kingdom is a group we started with some college mates. Many years ago. God, ask him about Belasco already. In college I reconnected with this world. And I made the worst mistake a beginner can make. For pure vanity. I introduced my friends in the dark arts. And that's when Kingdom's idea was born. Having a kingdom of our own. Was President Belasco one of your college mates? Circumstantially. Yes. And was he a part of this group? I can answer that later on. ...we've launched the 'For them for ever' Project. Centered on the main energy source that makes the world turn. - The children. - Hi. I'm a '60 minutes before Midnight' producer. We talked last-- Hello? Hello! Maria. Where are the family records? They're somewhere over there. We're not using them. They're useless. Come here. I want to try something. What? How many children does Linares have? - Are you kidding me? - Please. - You have it right there. - Yes, but you know the answer. I don't do socials anymore, Jorge. I cover politics now. Please Maria, you know this. How many children does he have? Two. Two daughters. He just said it. Are you sure? How many children does Marcato have? None. And Senator Combret? One. - Balzi? - None. - Montenegro? - Three. Judge Biasotti? I have two cousins. - Sosa? - Stop it, Jorge! What's the point? Nothing. I was trying something. Daniel, you wanted to speak? Have you heard about Satanic Panic, Alfredo? Fear of the devil, witchcraft? It's a little more complex than that. And it it's not just fear. It's mass hysteria. Of course, guided by some personal interest. A conspiracy, you may say. A fear is placed in people's minds. Apparently justified. With a clear and material enemy. Let's see. In horror movies there's always been a demonic theme. 'The Omen'. 'Rosemary's Baby'. A possesed Andrea Del Boca in 'The Exorcist'. But as I say in my book. I explain the difference is... ...that they made an attempt to benefit from that fear. And make a profit out of it. That's the case of Marcato here. He places this ridiculous ideas to make a... potential religious empire. Do you know where we live? I don't know about you. I live in Buenos Aires. And where's Buenos Aires? In Argentina. And where's Argentina? In the world. It's been four years since we stopped living in Argentina. Let alone in Buenos Aires. Ok. So where are we living then? I can't explain to an ant that this is a TV Studio. Because it wouldn't understand me. The same thing happened with Senator Linares. Who doesn't have any memories of her daughter. Because she no longer exists in this reality. The same thing would've happened to the John Doe... who was dicovered by the guard at the exact moment... that my former partner was performing the ritual. The identity was erased. But the body wasn't. That's why it's impossible to explain an ant... - what is reality? - Abel. You're going in. - You OK? - Yes. I'm just a little nervous. Unlike human beings. Human beings understand. Human beings create. Human beings imagine. Human beings learn. And that's what I teach in the farms. Channel 6. Dani, it's Abel. I'm ready. I teach them, to stop being ants. - And why tell them the world is ending? - Excuse me, gentlemen. We have a call. Good evening, who is this? Hi, I'm Mariana. From Vicente Lopez. - Dani, hello? - Hello, Mariana. Good night. - What happened? - Line's dead. Any question for our guests? Or comments? First of all, I'm very sorry that you won't be on air anymore. I think what you were doing was so brave. - The line is busy. - We are going to the rally with my husband. They can't get away with this. Right? Great, Mariana. Would you like to ask anything to our guests? Yes, I'd like to ask Marcato. If possible. - Marcato. - Yes. Yes. On with your question, Mariana. Mr. Marcato, I'd like to know if you're aware we fuck your daughter, that whore. Every day in every possible hole available-- - Excuse us, Adrian. - He doesn't have a daughter. Do you know what we just talked to? I guess not Mariana from Vicente Lopez. No. It wasn't human. A demon? [Unintelligible] What happened, Abel? - He spoke to me. - Marcato didn't open his mouth. It must've been Dani. He spoke to me. Answer for ants. You wanted to say something before our call, Daniel. Do you need anything? To get out from there. Seriously, it must've been Dani. Sorry. - Were there any children in the farms? - What? Children. Kids. No. You didn't hear any kids crying? See any clothing or something? There were no children. Are you asking because of all that... Linares's daughter thing? - I didn't see any of that. - Then what did you see? Let's get inside. It's not safe out here. Daniel, you wanted to say something before our call. Why do you tell them the world is about to end? The world as we know it. The air we breath. The houses. The cars. All things. They are a single being that we adore but... ...who's running out of energy. It's about to die. What will happen to us if this occurs? The dream will be over. And does this have anything to do... with you taking distance from the group? - The Magus doesn't want this entity to die. - The Magus? It's the true leader of the group. - Belasco you mean. - Alfredo. If I didn't knew you I'd think you're buying this. Fine, Marcato. Let's cut the nonsense. If you're a real warlock, prove it. Tell me what powers you have. I see through you like a crystal. OK. That's something. - Tell me, what do you see? - What do you want me to tell you? The first thing you see. Fear. Really? I feel very calm. No, you are dead scared. You know everything I said tonight is true. You found out while writing that book. And now it's for sale and eveyone is buying it. So you can't back down. You know that eveything I said is true. That warlocks are real. That there are beings living in another reality. That we can communicate with them. There was an interview, that you didn't dare to publish. That you didn't even transcribe. - They convinced you not to. - Right. You must be an amazing sci-fi writer. And I'm sure you have ways to know things beforehand. Like a true con man. But no. Know that if those testimonies aren't here... it's because they were rants from delusional people. Like your wife. Yes. My ex-wife. Exactly. Long time since you last saw her. - She can't see people. - You're wrong. She sees much more now. Much more. This is what I was talking about, Alfredo. This. It's all in my book. Satanic Panic. They place fear. They exploit it. They profit from it. - Help, please! - Fucking shit. Let's go to commercials. How did he do that? - It must've been a coincidence. - It wasn't a coincidence. Then what's the option? Black magic? Isn't that why we're here? What's the menace? What are we trying to uncover? Von Merkens thinks they're warlocks. I know what I saw in the farms. And this man we're trying to get a confirmation of... ...tells us the most important company of our country is a coven. What else you need to fucking understand what's happening? - What if he is playing insane? - Marcato? Why? First he said Linares had surrendered a daughter. But Linares only has two children. We know that's not true. Like a test question on a lie detector. They're the key to understand everything else. Von Merkens' guy said if we were able to isolate Marcato's delusions... - there's enough data to knock Belasco over. - I think that could be it. He could be speaking in code. All that warlock thing. The Mac-- Ma-- Magus! Belasco is the Magus. I'm sure. Then what's the key, Maria? What's the code for a missing child... a world and state ruled by warlocks? Bribery? Dirty money for the campaign? Natalia. Natalia. Nat-- You broke the phone. Natalia. - Speak. - It's Natalia. - Sorry, we still got nothing. - The car I told you... Passed a few more times. And then a guy got off. Where is he? He's standing on the corner, across the street. But what is he doing? Is he standing there doing nothing? - Is he looking at you? - He's wearing dark glasses but I think he is. Easy, we're almost there. He's coming. Keep talking, Nati. He's crossing the street and coming right at me! Natalia. I'm sorry. I'm a fucking idiot. What's happening? Nothing. The guy met with a girl. And they're leaving holding hands. - Do you want me to send someone? - No, it's not necessary. Besides, they wouldn't get here before 1am. Yes. You are right. OK. For better or worse, we'll be done in half an hour. Let's hope so. The rally will start at 12am. If you see people going downtown blend with them. OK. - Do you have a place to stay tonight? - Yes. Blend in and disappear as soon as possible. - Fine. - We'll talk in fifteen minutes. In twelve. We want to bring calm to Daniel Aguilar's friends and family. He's already been taken to San Juan's Hospital. And his wife, Norita is informed of the situation. We've also arranged another vehicle for her to get to the Hospital as well. Daniel is feeling better. And sends his gratitude to everyone. On the other hand... ...I want to sincerely apologize to all our viewers. At the beginning of the show... ...we made a commitment to get to the bottom of this investigation. That wasn't possible. It was probably our fault. For not doing our best. Marcato. What's your relationship with President Belasco exactly? I'm not in condition to answer that. I need to know who the Jon Doe is, and why he was murdered. - That's not what we arranged. - I want to know who Eduardo Alonso is. When we contacted you we made an implicit arrangement. You needed something. And so did we. We sent someone to look for what you needed. In exchange for you confirming that information. - You don't have what I need. - Then help us find it! You have to understand they're watching this. And we have no time. Fine. I'll talk. Did you touch anything? They took us off the air. What happened? - We're off the air. - Why? Did the network order it? It wasn't the network. Everything is running fine. We have energy but we aren't transmiting. Do you have anything to do with this? Marcato! MARCATO! Dani is not answering. They found us. Turn off the lights. Turn off the lights! LS89 Transmiting. Channel 6. Across the country. Maria. LS89 Transmiting. Channel 6. Across the country. LS89 Transmiting. Channel 6.

Nor having to work with you again after tonight. But what we're doing here has nothing to do with journalism. And I don't like that. But like Lucio said... Classes finish after midnight. So... Cheers. - Hello? - Hi, mom. It's me. Maria. God, Maria. How are you? It's been a long time. Where are you? I'm fine. You? - How are you? - Fine. In bed, trying to sleep. You weren't watching the show? The trasnmission went off. I was expecting the worst. Where are you? Will I see you tomorrow? You promised. It depends on what happens before midnight. Do you have any idea how much I'm suffering, Maria? Great. What a shame you're not on spring break like me. Do you know what people say about you? I can imagine. That you are the lover of that disgusting old man Alfredo. And you believe them, mom? You don't know me at all. I though I knew you until you started this ridiculous thing. It's not ridiculous. It's my job. There was a guy on TV saying that we live inside a... thing. Do you really want to go back to doing social journalism? That Alfredo man has no shame. I'm disgusted by that creep. I hope what people are saying isn't true. Mom, I need the uncle's new phone number. He changed it, and they won't give it to me. I'm not surprised after everything you people said. After everything he did for you. All the contacts. Give it to me. Please. It's important. For what? You already told enough lies. This is different. It's for his own good. I don't think that's a good idea. Give me the uncle's phone number, mom! If you give me the number I promise I'll visit you. - Take note. - Ok. Tell me. 379-6481. Ok. So what time are you com-- - Speak. - Hi, uncle. Don't be cynical, Maria. What do you want? Fine, Marcelo. I had enough with Mom. Are you watching the show? I just turned it on, but it's off the air. Do you know who Marcato is? The lunatic who's talking nonsense on TV. Marcato went to College with Belasco. What Belasco? The President. Are you messing with me? Go on. Marcato introduced Belasco and other common friends... into alternate business techniques. After graduating, they founded a small company. That grew into an enormous one. - Kingdom Corporate. - Yes. First they stepped into politics, and then got to the presidency. The entire cabinet is or was registered as part of the company. By 'introduced them into alternate business techniques' you mean... Yes, witchcraft! Witchcraft. I'm sorry. I don't believe that part of the story either. But we have proof of several other worst and real things... ...that link them as partners from the beginning. Please keep watching. He'll confirm it before midnight. Why would I need confirmation from this guy? To open a case. Against who? Belasco? Are you insane? We have six boxes with copies. And we can deliver them to you at 1am. Maria, you're not even on the air right now. He's going to confirm it! Where are you? I can't tell you until the show is over. Are you fucking kidding me, kid? Marcelo, I'm going to call at 12am-- I'll give you the address and you'll come get the files at 1am. Marcelo! Yes. I heard you. I'll wait for your call. It's done. Now the network's phone is dead. They're back on. I hope this isn't for nothing. How long is this going to take? The whole ritual takes hours but the roots have already made effect so... - Two hours... - Ok. We have ten minutes. If anything goes wrong you wake us up. I don't think I can. But I'll try. On an ideal scenario... we would try a complete disconnection from the senses. And in our case? We have these. Cover your eyes and ears. And sit as comfortable as you can. Put your forearms on the table. With the palm of your hands down... ...feeling the wood. Breath deeply and slow. Abel. Abel! Abel! Abel take me out! Abel! Breath deeply and slowly. I get that you are not fine with this. I've been trying to do politic journalism for years. And once I got there you plot on this absurdity. It's not absurd. - If you'd only try to-- - ...believe you're a psychic like in the movies. - That? - It's not that. I think they can't hide it anymore. They're running out of energy. And what they're trying to hide is starting to leak. Look. I want you to see something before I show it to the rest. What's that? The John Doe. Did you show this to Alfredo? Let's get back inside and show him. What is it? A guy. Put your forearms on the table. With the palm of your hands down. Feeling the wood. Breath deeply and slow. Natalia? Warlock. Who is this? Warlock. Warlock. Warlock. Warlock. Warlock. Warlock. Warlock. Breath deeply and slowly. Nothing is happening. I don't feel anything. It's a big old house. In a residential neighborhood. It's empty but not abandoned. It's duplicated in other spots of the city. It's the exact same. And it has something inside... ...so that any of them can take it if needed. - You dreamt this too? - Yes. Marcato confirmed the house. But he says he has no access. They blocked him when he was expelled. He'll confirm everything if we grant him access. - Everything? - He will, if we present the report. Let's do it. This thursday night. - The Von Merkens got us an extra hour. - Really? - I thought there was no chance. - They tripled the pay for one program. They're insane. - Belasco is going to crush them. - Not if we do our part. We could have Marcato on the show to confirm live. - Excuse me. - Maria. - Do we know any of the houses' address? - Yes, of course. We have 5. Any of them near Asamblea and Malabia? Downtown? - That's near... - Beaumont Park. Melian 4100. Melian 4100. Where's Abel? Who is Abe-- Maria. What happened? He's one of them. What do you mean? Abel is a warlock. He killed Lucio and then tried to kill me. What time is it? How much time has passed? Natalia never called? Natalia! Professor Lucio sent me. His phone died and he couldn't reach you. I have the address. It's late, Natalia. There's nowhere to go, Natalia. There's nowhere you can hide. Natalia. Maria. I need to try something again. What? How many children does Linares have? What are you doing? You know it. How many children does he have? Three. Three daughters. Marcato? None. Combret? Two. Montenegro? Two. Judge Biasotti? Three. I have three cousins. What happened to them, Jorge? The same thing that will happen to everyone during the Midnight Rally. What? They are taking the children. What year did you graduate? Do you remember? The future is over. Natalia! - Tell me you have it. - Melian 4100. You're two blocks away. I was. Natalia. Where's the professor? - Why didn't he pick up the phone? - He can't talk right now. What happened? We have less than ten minutes. You have to hurry up. Beloved audience. For those who are still watching... - They're back. - ...thank you for waiting. We have still... ...four minutes until midnight. We were able to get back on air... ...after some... issues on the set. This will definitely be a night to remember... ...for any of the witnesses here. Now, sadly... We came back just to apologize... ...because we have failed you. The old man is about to give up. What are you doing on the phone? I remember everything. I need you to call the network. Talk to Dani. Tell them to hold on. I'm almost there. There's four minutes left. I'm on a cab. I'm almost there. What do you mean 'on a cab'? Talk to Dani, please. Dani, it's Jorge. You have to hold on. Natalia is almost there. And I need to talk to the old man directly. In this that we considered as important... as the search for the truth. To conclude... Marcato. You too had expectations about what was happening tonight... ...that weren't accomplish. Tell me exactly what you think is going to happen. Do you really want to know? The camera is all yours. Go on. Things are going to get worse. The Magus is going to seal a new deal. And everything will start over. And he'll probably make another one. And another. Until our entire existence is reduced to a lifeless shell. But still alive. - Third. - In exchange for that energy Belasco gave them- It's just a matter of time. - If you believe- - Let her in! Sorry I'm late. - Is this what you were looking for? - Yes, read what you need to read. I'll confirm it. But give it to me, please. I'm going to read the main items of the report. - And you'll confirm them, or not. - Milagros! Dear. It's dad. Listen. How are you? Are you ok? Yes, I'm fine. Listen to me. Where are you? Are you home? - You said he didn't have any children. - First. Doctor Emilio Belasco. President of our country... - ...is a warlock. And you introduced him. - Yes. Second. Belasco and his group came to power by using black magic... ...murdering the opposition... - ...blackmailing politicians... - Marcelo, are you watching? ...and erasing from existence anyone who confronted them. I'll send you the address. Yes. Honey, listen to me. I need you to go to my library, quickly. Third. For this transactions you used energy that was given... - ...by a pact you made with entities from other worlds. Yes. Listen to me. I want you to-- In the top shelf. There's a thin book, with a beige cover. The name is... - 'Things we lost in the fire'. - Fourth. - In exchange for the energy, Belasco gave them-- Your future. Listen to me. I want you to read. Inside there's a loose paper. It has a word written. - I want you to read that word. - Fifth. And last. I want you to count to 20. And read the word out loud. I can confirm that. Or I can do something much better. I can show you. I want you all to raise the volume of your TV. Until you can hear it from the outside. I regret everything I did. Ka-- LS89 Transmiting. Channel 6.
