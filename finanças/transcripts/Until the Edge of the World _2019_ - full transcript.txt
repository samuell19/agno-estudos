My Daddy always says, when you feel really weak, icebergs break off the North Pole somewhere, to show you how strong you really are. And when you're small, that just means you have a lot of outgrowing yourself left to do. And I'm good at that, he always says. He told me if a moment comes where you're really sad, you can wish yourself wherever you want to go. You just have to wish really hard. I think this is a moment like that. But the place I wish to go is different from all other places that exist. There's no wind there, because there's no air at all there. Not even the teeniest tiniest breath of air. And it's icy cold, "freezier" than in the fridge. It's a strange place. There are no sounds at all there. It's "mouse-whispery" quiet and also a little bit spooky. And one side is "dungeon-dark". I mean, really, "pitch-dark". If you look closely at him, you'll see he has dark and light patches. Did you know that the dark ones are actually craters deep as canyons? And the light ones are mountains like skyscrapers? Or that he changes his shape? There's just one thing, one snag. Although he's our neighbour, it takes a very long time to reach him. Because there's no road. You have to cross the blackness above the clouds. For three days, shut into a little capsule. That's the only thing that makes me a little bit afraid. But it's not a bad thing to be afraid of something. It even happens to adults. My Daddy was away from home for a long time. Mummy always says it's a miracle he came back to us. Since then, he's often told me bedtime stories. One is about his fear. It starts like this: UNTIL THE EDGE OF THE WORLD It happens with incredible force. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Patient 3 has finished the course of antibiotics. Number 4, we need a new approach. OK, fine. Did the medication help? Yes. A few hours' sleep. I couldn't hold her back. She wanted to be with him at once. We agreed that you and your daughter would come to me first. Before a child of her age sees a relative, a preparatory talk is important. And what would you have said? I'm not on duty the next two days. Dr. Wegener will be there for you. But you can reach me at any time. Okay. -It's the first thing I feel. -Flo. A dull blow under my chest, pressing through my body again and again. I know it's happening inside me, but it feels like it's happening miles away. Hot air is forcing itself into my lungs, a shrill whistle pierces my head. I want to open my eyes, or maybe they're long since open. And everywhere these voices and knowing who they are. Try to get up, but not a muscle moves. In front of me nothing but grey clouds. Come here. Come here to me. We'll make it nice here. We'll push the beds together and get some of your toys. Then it won't be so empty and unfriendly here, OK? Why are we here? So we can be nice and close to Daddy. Not have to travel all the time. It's better. Where is he? Here in the hospital. You know that. We were just there. Is he dead? Flo... Flo, no, listen to me. Listen to me, OK? Just because Daddy isn't moving doesn't mean that he's dead. OK? He's very close to us. No. Why not, Flo? He isn't. -Flo, listen to me! -He is not. Flo. Flo, look. Look, we don't know much about Daddy's condition at the moment. He might be ... He's... He might be somewhere else, he might be just far away. What do you mean, far away? Far, far... What do you mean, far away? Come on, let's go home. What do you mean, far away? Can I give you this? We've changed our minds. We'd rather go home. Flo, are you coming? Flo? Flo? Flo, are you coming? What do you mean, far away? Come on, let's go home. What do you mean, far away? Why are we here? So we can be nice and close to Daddy. Not have to travel that all the time. It's better. Where is he? Here in the hospital. You know that. We were just there. -Is he dead? -No. You're lying the other way round. Sleep tight. See you in the morning. Leave them open! Can he see us? You know, it's completely different. Different how? It's cold and dark. Just different. But up there, you're very light almost as if you don't have weight any more. Yes. But it's just a visit. Sleep well. However far away I am from everything, it happens more and more often and for a moment, everything is suddenly so real again. As if it's happening right here again, before my eyes. How I'd love to allow it, Julie. Your gazes. But the longer you look at me, the less I recognise myself in your gaze. And I don't know if it's really me. It really feels like my own thoughts are strangers to me. And I know, I know that you feel it ... and how hard it is for you to see me like this. Unable to do anything. And ... I do notice Flo also slowly starting to understand. As if part of me is not here. With her. He isn't there any more. Flo, invisible to the naked eye. At night, the sun lights up the moon. Making him easily visible to the human eye against the inkblank sky. In bright daylight, it's difficult for us to see him in the sky. But in fact he never leaves our side, even during the day. He is our faithful companion, and in the evening, when it's dark, we'll be able to gaze on him again. INVISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE What does it say there? GOING TO THE MOON Now take your rucksack off. Do I get a kiss? Are you coming back later? Of course I'm coming back. Can I talk to you for a moment? Go on, go and play. Run. I can imagine how hard it is for you at the moment, but don't you think it's also a bit too soon for Flo? What do you mean, far away? Come on, let's go home. What do you mean, far away? You see, there's a place there, where you can rest, if you're as exhausted as Daddy is right now. What place do you mean? Hasn't it occurred to you that there's something up there, always up there, wherever we are? Wherever we are? Yes, wherever. Can he see us? In the past people used to fear that if they went too far out to sea, they'd fall off the edge of the world. Like off a plate. But people in those days just didn't know that the Earth is round like a ball, and you can't fall off it at all. People in those days knew very little about the Earth just like we today know very little about the universe. We don't even know if it has a beginning or an end. In the vastness of space the Moon is our neighbour. But even he is a long journey away. You have to fly for three days in a big rocket through the darkness of space. Even for the cleverest scientists the universe is a big puzzle. Imagine a long corridor, with other corridors going off it and others going off from those corridors too. You can't find your way there at all. Some scientists look up into the sky through lenses as big as elephants and they're always discovering new and unknown things. Like going through a new door into another corridor. And from there through more doors into new corridors, with doors into more, longer corridors. And so on, farther and farther, again and again, deeper and deeper. And we can't even dare to dream what's hidden behind some of these doors. Oh shit. Can he see us? You know, it's completely different. Different how? It's cold, and, and dark. Just different. Almost as if you don't have weight any more. But it's just a visit. I'd be happy to take Flo home with us tomorrow after kindergarten. Mila was asking about it. She asked me if it's true. -Why? What, what do you mean? -Julia, the whole kindergarten group knows the story. Flo talks about nothing else. If I can help you in any way... I know how difficult this all is for you. -But I don't know if it's right to... -You know nothing. You know nothing at all. Her father is attached to 5 million tubes in hospital, in his bed. She tries to lift his fingers, whispers to him... She doesn't understand what's going on. I have the feeling that Flo is losing herself in it all. You're making out that she's sick. She believes in a story that seems to make it easier for her, that's it. Mrs Haferkamp gave these to me. Flo is refusing to do anything else. What does it say there? He isn't there any more. One new message. Today, 20:11. Hey Julie, I'm sorry. Call me back, OK? I'm here for you all... Play back old messages. Message 1 12.04., 22:03... Hi honey, just wanted to say, I'll be home a bit late. Long, long ago, the Moon was part of the Earth. Until a huge impact knocked him out. Ever since, he's been above us, and wherever you are, he never disappears from our side. Look carefully at him. Did you know that he changes his shape a little bit every day? From a crescent, to the circular full moon. Tell me, what does he look like now, above you? It had been raining that day. The road was wet. Maybe you were lost in thoughts. Tired, I don't know. They resuscitated you at the accident site. The emergency doctor says you were probably already brain-dead then. I don't know why I insisted on staying by the machines for three weeks. I thought, I thought, maybe you'd change your mind again. Or someone would. Why do you always sleep here? Flo, please go back to bed. Please. Flo... Because I can see him better from here. That's why. Better than from here? As if everything was merged into oneself: thoughts, memories. And I'd so love to just scream it all out, for you to understand what's happening inside me. But nothing happens! Instead, this constant fear of getting swallowed up again and the thought: what if it stays like this and I ... I never quite find my way back. Can you hear me? And I know that no one can see how it looks from here. It's as if, as if I'm looking at a familiar world, but no longer from inside. Where is he? Why are we here? -Can he see us? -Flo? What do you mean, far away? Wherever we are? He isn't there any more. Are you coming back later? Is he dead? -Flo. Do you know what I dreamt? I was a long way away. So far away that everything around me was black. And the Earth was blue like a water droplet. But it wasn't a nightmare. I was quite close to him up there, behind a thick pane of glass. And can you guess what it was that woke me? It was when I got tired in the dream and fell asleep. I hope I dream that dream again tonight. And if I do, I won't get tired in it, I'll stay awake. For three dream days, until I reach him. I already know where I'd land. What about you, Mummy? What did you dream? Go on, tell me! What did you dream? You won't believe me, but my dream was very like yours. How? It was like a window, on the world. Yes, mine too. Here you are. Maybe Daddy is sending us these pictures, so he doesn't have to travel alone. Flo ... No one can send dreams. Or thoughts. -They belong only to you. -No. They belong to all of us. Mrs Weidkamp? Flo? Mrs Weidkamp? Dr. Wegener. I'm standing in for Dr. Renzig. -If I can do anything for you. -Yes, I'll let you know. I know you're all waiting for me. I know that. Good. Flo? There are small, strange things. The feeling something's not right. Unease coming closer and closer. And from one second to the next, everything goes dark. Flo? I want to open my eyes or maybe they've been open a long time already. And it takes a while until all the smoke and dust resolves into the first shapes again. Right in front of me. And I know that my body is here, but my head just won't come back. The soles of my feet tickle. Have to be careful and forget your weight. Quietly get up. Not how I imagined it. I didn't know that a place could be so lonely, so desolate. And whichever way you look there are grey hills and mountains. It's a powerful place. Because the sky there isn't blue, like ours. It's inky black. There's just one eerie thing. Every step there is not as light as a feather. And there's no one to talk to there. No one to listen. You're alone with your thoughts. Flo? You're never allowed to frighten me like that again, understand? You know all the things that can happen in the street. Are you going to tell me what you wanted out there? Mila. What do mean, Mila? Mila helped me. That's not what I asked. Although he's gigantic, the Moon to us in the end is only as big as a pea. Small as a pea. That's because of the huge distance him and us. -What do you think? -What do you think? If you looked at the Earth from the Moon, how big would she look? You're too far away. But I'm always here. Flo? I don't know which is moving away faster. Flo? Me from everything or everything from me. As if I'm forgetting how my life feels from nearby. I just want to feel that I'm still part of this world. I know this is all happening inside me. And not around me. And I can't do anything about it, except wait. For it to pass. So I open my eyes and I'm back here. With you. Flo? The Moon so close. As he dances around the Earth, he always turns the same face to us. If you look closely, you can see his dark light patches. But though he appears to us so powerfully, he keeps his far side well hidden. It still holds mysteries, which will have to be studied in more detail on future lunar missions. For us humans, a flight to the Moon needs good preparation. Astronauts train for years for it. The Moon is a place without air. It isn't easy to talk to each other there. Because there's no sound. Every word we speak would be silent up there. So astronauts can only speak via radios. Renzig residence, hello? Hello? Hello? Weidkamp, I'd like to speak to Dr. Renzig. Hello, Mrs. Weidkamp. -My husband is not on duty today. -I know, but he did say I could call. I see. I... I'll get him. Wait a moment, please. Hello, Mrs Weidkamp. I'm ready. OK. Would you like to make your way to the hospital? -Yes. -OK. I'll be there. Minus 10. 9, 8, 7, 6... 5, 4, 3, 2, 1... Julie. What is it? What is it? What is it? The hospital called, I have to spend the night there. -I'll come with you. -That's... That's not necessary. I'm going alone. Could you maybe wait at our house? For three weeks they've been waiting all of them, at the hospital, for me. For me to finally let you. For me to finally say goodbye. And now? Here I am. And I can't say a word. Just like you, the past eighteen months. Everything just thoughts. There's so much I want to say to you. But I can't. Something is holding it inside me. Holding it tight. So now I think I know what you mean. How hard it is to turn some thoughts into words. We need a signature from you. We have a chaplain in the hospital, if you want. OK, I'll... I'll come back in a moment. Could you pass on something to Dr. Renzig from me? I'd like to stay here. I mean... I mean, when it's time. When... When the machines are switched off... I'd like them to call me. Is that possible? And if... If I don't answer, that means I don't want to be there. Don't want to be present. OK. Should the doctor come and see you again? Once the machines are switched off, it happens quite fast. From experience, two or three minutes. Can you hear me? I've learnt a lot about the Moon. How long it takes to get there. That you have to go through the darkness. If it's true that there's no air up there and that it gets "freezer-cold" there and there are no sounds. If it's true that it's darker than any cellar there. Then we have to start practising in plenty of time. I've talked to Flo. She's been in her room for hours. I'll stay with you for a few days. I'd like to be alone. Flo? -Can I come in? -Not possible! -Why not, Flo? -No air must come in. For us humans, a flight to the Moon needs good preparation. Astronauts train for years for it. The Moon is a place without air. It isn't easy to talk to each other there. Because there's no sound. Every word we speak would be silent up there. So astronauts can only speak via radios. My Daddy told me that some of his thoughts are like craters he has to go into again and again. There are many different kinds. Small ones spread over a large area. And big ones that are not so easy to avoid. Most of all, though, he was afraid of the deep ones that come out of nothing. Some so deep that they'd swallow you up, if you got too close. That's why he was always away a long time, because he had to go through these craters, he told me. Mummy told me that he experienced a lot of things in another country that he couldn't talk about. Not even to her. And where only doctors could help. 563 days I've been back. Since my return. And no week passes without an incident. It happens with incredible force. And from one second to the next, everything goes dark. And you're amidst it all again, as if it was happening for the first time. It's the first thing I feel: A dull blow under my chest, pressing through my body again and again. I know it's happening inside me, but it feels like it's happening miles away. Hot air is forcing itself into my lungs. A shrill whistle pierces my head. Try to get up, but not a muscle moves. I want to open my eyes, or maybe they're long since open. And everywhere these voices and knowing who they are. And in front of me nothing but grey clouds. Eternal moments till I understand, until all the smoke and dust resolves into the first shapes again. Right in front of me. It... It happens slowly, like on a Polaroid. And more come. It never stops. It... There are no words for what I've seen. It takes me an eternity to tear myself away from this sight. To turn on my back. Blue sky. Clouds. Birds flying by. Till suddenly it goes quiet. I lie like this for days. But later I learn that it was only an hour. A few fractures. Nothing else gone. I'm flown out of the country the same day. Home. But it feels like I never quite came back. As if part of me stayed behind there. They say I was the only one in my unit who survived. And that it's a great miracle. A unique miracle. Day 576. I... I don't believe in miracles. Can you hear me? Mila's Mummy told me. That you aren't just visiting up there. You're there forever. Do you remember telling me about the craters? Mummy has read quite a lot to me about the Moon. You won't believe me, but you really have to take care. There are lots of them up there. Deeper than any craters down here. You have to be really careful. Because nobody can help you up there. Not even me. When I grow up, I'll visit you. I'll become an astronaut and fly to the Moon. And we'll see each other again and fly back. Whether you believe it or not. I do believe in miracles. Take off minus 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...
