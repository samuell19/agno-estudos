[suspenseful music] [footsteps] Hedda. Hedda. Hedda? Hedda? Hedda? [suspenseful music] [dogs barking] What you doing? [dogs barking] Huh? You're all right. [inaudible] Aw, you're OK. [inaudible] [chuckling] [playful exclamations] [inaudible] So how's my baby? [inaudible] very good day. How's mine? I'm a little weaker by years of abuse. [phone ringing] Hello? Can you speak a little louder, please? I can't hear you. [suspenseful music] Yeah, she's here. Oh, OK. Can I ask who this is concerning? What? He says it's private. Yes? Jackson. [chuckling] Is that really you? Why? Why don't you come by? For the weekend? Sure, that would be OK. I'd love to see you. Hedda, what'd you invite him over here for? Please, Neal. He'll only be here for 36 hours. Then he leaves for his computer seminar. What's a short visit from an old friend going to hurt, anyway? It's not any ordinary friend, Hedda. And you know it. Please, Neal. After all these years, you're still going on. Why don't you just bury it once and for all? Because some wounds never heal, Hedda. Especially when you allow them to fester, Neal. Get. Get. Come on. Get. [dog whimpering] [dogs barking] [inaudible] Come on. [dog whimpering] Hey. [dogs barking] [melancholic music] Hi. Hey. But let's not let anything come between us again. Hedda, I'm trying. I'm trying. Try harder, Neal. Please? Keep trying. [playing piano] Jackson. [giggling] [inaudible] How are you? [giggling] [suspenseful music] [dishes rattling] I'll take mine Irish. Neal, at this hour? I thought this was a celebration. Care to join me, Jackson Carter? No, thanks-- never touch this stuff. Smoke, then. Not this time, thanks. [suspenseful music] So Jackson, what brings you around these parts? I'm here for a seminar. [inaudible] artificial intelligence. [chuckling] Oh. Yeah. You won't find a lot of that around here, I'm afraid. I'll leave for Belgium on Sunday, 7:35 PM. Chocolates, anyone? No, thanks. You two go ahead. I've got work to do. [suspenseful music] My flesh and bones. My baby. [hammer thuds] It's my blood. She's my wife. Hey, Neal. Thought I'd bring you some coffee. I'm working on a cradle for the baby. Baby? I didn't know you were having one. Yeah, six more months. Yeah, congratulations. That's great. Yeah, I'm very happy. [inaudible] for Hedda. What's that supposed to mean? I thought she was unable to [inaudible].. [clattering] Look what you've done. You crippled it. Jackson? Jackson? [suspenseful music] Not here. Not now. [glass breaking] Why do you stay here, trapped in the woods like this? It's peaceful. It's good that we're away. Away? Away from what? [glass breaking] What are you trying to escape from? You did so well at the conservatory. Why'd you give it all up for this? I didn't give it all up. I simply left it behind. The past is over. Only memories linger. And often, that's enough. Sometimes, that's too much. [panting] [yelps] [tense music] [groaning] Back to nature, huh? Why don't you join us? Sure, yeah. Three's a crowd. Neal, what happened? I got locked in the attic. That's funny. It was open when I left it. Yeah, it must have been the wind, then, huh? Neal, why don't we go in the house and bandage it before it becomes infected? Don't start with me, Neal. You're the one invading foreign territory. Neal, if you remember correctly, I was invited here. Just stop. You don't have to start in. Hedda, keep out of this. This is between him and me. Look, between you and yourself, Neal, I'm not part of your little charade. Don't talk down to me, Private Jackson Carter. I'm not a private. And I'm not in the Army, Neal. You're not going to be around here much longer, either, motherfucker. Stop this. Hedda, shut up. Get in the house. Hey, don't talk to her like that. Don't tell me how to talk to my own wife, you idiot. You put up with this? Fuck you. [suspenseful music] [machinery whirring] [suspenseful music] [slow breathing] [suspenseful music] [footsteps] Where is he? Out walking, I would imagine. He killed my dog. What are you talking about? If you don't [inaudible],, it's suspicious. You killed my dog. What? And why would I do that? Because you're a twisted bastard. And you're a paranoid schizophrenic. You probably killed the dog and don't even remember doing it-- or at least won't admit to it. Get out of my house. I will-- day after tomorrow. As it was in the beginning, ashes to ashes, a war on want, time without end, man moves in mysterious ways, blind to their own desires, afraid of themselves, terrified and tortuous. [squealing] [suspenseful music] Must seek out leader of the Foundation for the Advancement of Legal Knowledge, whereabouts unknown, [inaudible] as possible. Enemy must be intercepted before more data's available. Over. [hoofbeats] [tense music] [dog barking] [moaning] [pounding] [melancholic music] [pounding] [footsteps] Are you all right? Of course I am. Why do you ask? [inaudible] day. I'm exhausted. That's all. [inaudible] If I'm making this any harder for you, I'm sorry. I was just a lot happier when he wasn't here. Please, not this again. No, I'm not starting. I just-- I don't want anything to happen to you. Well, then, don't let it, OK? I won't. I won't. Skeletons come back to haunt. The air turns still. Blood smokes. The knives twist inside. Against better judgment, time scoops on in the twisting sound of false memory. Mortality curses the living dead the repetition of history. Doctor, this rheumatism, it's killing me. What do you want? Your cure, the woman. You had her three times already. [inaudible] You couldn't get more than that. I need this woman. It's the only thing that works. You've got syphilis. And you know it. But if you don't want your people to know it, too-- OK, you better pay more. [speaking french] But look at the shape you're in. I need this woman. [gears turning] [tense music] [muffled punch] [playing piano] [eerie music] I don't care. He doesn't care. She's beyond caring. So what is this territory I'm defending? [eerie music] Well, can I just ask him man to man? Why can't I just go up to him and just say, hey, man, look. Please. [eerie music] Maybe she's just using this as an excuse not to bleed. She's terrified of her own blood-- or the blood of my blood, flesh of my flesh. [eerie music] Here dwells in the hearts of man and inside the bellies of women. [eerie music] [melancholic music] [moaning] To relieve the burden of my mothers is to escape to a place which does not exist-- without reason, without conscience, no jealousy, no guilt. To excuse would be to deny their lies come easily to lips. It's always made sweeter at the expense of others. [suspenseful music] [exhales] What am I doing? I don't want to tangle with her husband. Yet I see this as being unavoidable. I see now that I use my work to avoid myself. I confront everything else to avoid confronting myself. [exhales] [eerie music] Time and distance mean nothing. Past lives lie to suit themselves. Their jealousy is fueled by the pleasures of others, which they cannot bear to tolerate, refuse to be baited by manmade traps. Make peace with the space of time which within one waits. [inaudible] Good boy. [hoofbeats] [dog whining] [inaudible] [bell tolling] [inaudible] Stop it. Where is it, Neal? Where's what? He knows what I'm talking about. No. As a matter of fact, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. My tape, Neal-- my tape that was in my machine. Where is it? Look who's being paranoid now. Neal, a lot of work went into those tapes. You're breaking my heart. Maybe you just misplaced them. That's impossible. I looked everywhere. Did you look up your ass? Both of you, just please be reasonable. How am I supposed to be reasonable with a pain in the ass? Don't push me, Private. [tense music] Cut it out. Come on. Neal, stop it. [grunting] [inaudible] Please. Neal, please. Stop it. Ow. [grunting] Please stop it. Neal, please. [grunting] Come on. Don't play me, fucking cop. Come on. Get your little ass over here. [grunting] Fuck it. [inaudible] Will you just please get out? Stop it. Stop it, baby. [exclaims] Stop it, baby. [inaudible] Rot in hell. Fuck you. [drill whirring] [footsteps] [labored breathing] [tense music] They don't know what to do about me. [labored breathing] [inaudible] Exile was a dream we returned to a place we couldn't be. It took you to a place you've never been. You stopped dead in the night of space for fresh [inaudible],, hung between the torture posts of limitation and desire, dusk to dust, a warden of my own reflection. The history of luminous motion is that progress men and women make into the world alone, for tortured remains lay in wait, ready to spring upon the next innocent prey.
