(creature growls) (birds chirp) (knocks on door) - Hi. How may I help you, sir? I'm Dr. Helms. - [Man] I know this is gonna sound crazy. - There's no such thing, sir. There are only explanations. What is happening? - Our daughter, Sarah? She's been acting strange. (suspenseful music) (quill scribbles) - Sarah. How are you feeling? (eerie tones) I'll be there tonight, sir. - Thank you. (dark acoustic music) (crickets chirp) (knocks on door) - Where is she? - Upstairs. In her room, with my husband. - May I? - Yes, of course. (Sarah snarls) (Sarah growls) - [Father] Sarah!

(Sarah speaks unintelligibly) What do you want? - I have what I want. - Let her go. - Won't you come join us, Father? - Thus sayeth the law of Israel. Thou shall not suffer a witch to live. (Sarah snarls) - Evil will consume you. - Let her go. Take me. - Why don't I just take you both? - Because you can't. If you let her go, you can have me. - Why would I want you? - [Helms] Because I can close the spiritual door, and you can live forever. - Deal. (rumbling) - Go! Go! Go!

The weekend is here. Can't you just hear the surf in the background? Well, no, you can't, but I can imagine it anyway. Rock 106 is the perfect companion, all weekend long, for continuous rock and Harley, anytime. From Rock 1067. No, that's not surf. That's idling motor vehicles. Here's Patty-O with Rock 106 Sky Watch Morning Traffic. - All over the place, too, we're sponsored by 8-1 Pizza. It's hard to know where to start, but we'll go to the biggest trouble spot, and that remains 495 northbound at route two. In case you're just getting into the car, a major accident occurred and it has caused a 10-mile delay. The town's affected, including everything from the city, out to Tilton. I see a one-mile backup on the approach to the interstate. Just a slow rollover the top of the turnpike outbound from Jackson Field to exit 17. And be warned, if you normally exit onto 495, don't do that.

This is harder to do than I thought. First, I want you to know you are the best thing that's happened to me in a very long time. I know this is not the best way to do this, but I feel like we are on different pages in our lives and I'm really looking for something you can't give, and this isn't your fault, but over the past three months you just seem to be so consumed with work and your photography that we haven't had much time together. And you know my past history with long-distance relationships. They just don't work. You are an amazing guy and I truly hope you find what you have been looking for. And I'm sorry again to do this via text, but I think we should take some time apart. Love, Ashley. (phone rings) (phone rings) - Thanks for calling Northern Insurance Group. This is Doug. How can I help? Yes, sir. I'll be right there. - Doug, have a seat. Listen. (sighs) I'm sorry I have to do this, but with all the uncertainty in the market, we're gonna have to let you go. - [Doug] Okay. - I'm sorry. - So, this is it then, I guess. - Well, I hope you know that this is not personal. But hey, maybe now you can follow those dreams you always had. - Yeah. Maybe. (sighs) Well... Thanks for the opportunity. - Close the door. (door closes) (Doug sighs) (box thuds) - No. - Yep. Told you it was gonna happen. - No! Ah, shit. I'm next. What're you gonna do now? (Doug sighs) - You know that asshole actually gave me some decent advice for a change? - Wait. What? - Yeah, he told me I should follow my dreams and my passions and shit, which I think I'm gonna do. - Oh, so you about to start stripping? - Yeah. I go on, right after you. - Oh, don't knock it. Don't knock it. No, really. What's your plan? - Honestly? I think I'm gonna see where my photography takes me. - Oh, I can tell you what it's gonna take you. It's gonna take your ass straight to a soup kitchen. (Doug chuckles) - Oh, man. Look. I just need a break, you know? Thinking about renting a house or a cabin or something, up in the woods, just taking some time away. Breathe, regroup, snap some pics. - Well, just take care of yourself up north. God, those folks are having week-long yard sales, and having apple pickings and pumpkin pickings and shit. (Doug chuckles) - I actually think I may take up fishing. - Well, that's what's up. Some hot fish and some waves and booty. That's perfect. - Listen. I'll send you my address when I get up there. - All right. - In case you need a break. You know what I mean? - I can't go. I still have a job. You the one got let go, Doug. (Doug chuckles) On second thought. Send me that information. You still my boy. - [Doug] Okay. (brooding orchestral music) (muffled phone rings) - Hey, Dad. - {Father] Hey. - Yeah. So, it looks like I'm not gonna be an insurance adjuster anymore. - What do you mean? - Yeah, I got laid off. - [Father] Why? Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Just market adjustments, things like that. Ashley broke up with me via text. - [Father] Oh, well, so now what? - (sighs) Honestly? I'm probably just kind of head up north for a couple of days, you know? Rent a house in the woods. Just relax. Take some pictures and stuff. Just need to regroup. Get away from it. - [Father] Sure. Send us your location when you get there. - Yeah. All right, I will. - Love you, son. - I love you, too. - [Father] Maybe you can take this time to meet a nice girl. - Bye, Dad.

Hey, Dad. - Hey. - Finally, right? Don't have any service up here. - [Father] Where are you? - Ended up renting a bed and breakfast just north of Salem for a couple of days called the Black Swan Inn. - Please be careful. - Of course. - [Father] What're you doing there? - I just needed to get out of the city for a little while. My buddy Martin might come up for a little while, also. He wants to go fishing. You know how that is. - [Father] Nice. Well, next week, your mother and I will be around. So, hopefully you can make it home. - That's my plan. - Okay, good. Love you. - All right, love you too. (car door closes) (door creaks) - B and L Hardware. - Excuse me.

How's work? - Well, Chad and Lisa started humpin' in the HR office. Tim's touching people, so he's gonna catch a charge, and I need some more money. So, same shit, different day. - Listen, so, you coming up or not? Black Swan Inn. It's down a really, really long dirt road. There's no signs. You'll probably miss it. Black light post at the end. - Well, you know that's the plan, in case Captain Screwball decides to let me go. - Right. - All right, I'll see you on Friday - All right, man. See you soon, bye. - Later. (mellow music) (razor buzzes) (wind chimes ring) (car door slams) (door closes) - Excuse me. Sorry. Hey, what's the star in the window? - You mean that? - Yeah. - It's a pentagram. Protection against evil spirits. - "Evil spirits"? - Well, you see, in the late 1600s, Salem, Mass was known for witchcraft. - You mean witches? - Yes, but not the positive ones. You see, there's white magic and there's black magic. The white is positive, the black is destructive. So, the pentagram protects you from the destructive. - Hm. I see. (wind chimes ring) "Sparkling tooth powder"? (jar slams) Crazy. (stick rattles) So, seen any around lately? - (chuckles) Just my wife. - Good witch? - [Clerk] Sometimes. - Well, you keep that one at home. - That's the plan. - Okay, sir. Have a good day. - See you later. (wind blows) (mouse clicks) - Salem, Mass. There we go. "The Salem witch trials." (mouse clicks) (suspenseful music) Whoa. "The Salem witch trials were a series of hearings and prosecutions of people accused of witchcraft in colonial Massachusetts between February, 1692 and May of 1693. More than 200 people were accused. 30 were found guilty, 19 were executed by hanging, and one other man was pressed to death for refusing to plead, and at least five people died in jail." Holy shit. (keyboard clacks) (ominous music) "The pentagram was used as a Christian symbol. It stood for five wounds that Jesus Christ received during his crucifixion. The nails in each hand and foot, and the spear wound in the side. The pentagram was commonly seen as a symbol for good and protection against evil." (keyboard clacks) Black Swan Inn. Witchcraft. (keyboard clacks) There's nothing. (keyboard clacks) Black Swan Inn. Murder. (keyboard clacks) Here we go. "Black Swan Inn. In 1692, the house in the woods was the scene of a brutal murder, believed to be that of witchcraft." That's it? (keyboard clacks) That's it? Nothing else? (keyboard clacks) (sighs) Okay. I can't do this. Okay. (Doug sighs) (crickets chirp) (dark music) Can't believe I'm doing this. (leaves rustle) (shovel thuds) (shovel thuds) (shovel thuds) (shovel thuds) There it is. Fuck.

(phone clicks) (crickets chirp) (car locks clack) (dark orchestral music) (car door slams) (car starts) - [Officer] Yeah, we'll get that taken care of right away. How can I help you? - Is there someone I should talk to, I'm not really sure who, about a person watching me from the woods? - Who's watching you? - See, that's the thing. I don't know. I rented this bed and breakfast on Helms Place. - [Officer] Okay. - Black Swan Inn? - Yep. - And in the past couple days, there's just been somebody staring. - We can send a car up there, but if we don't see anything, there's not much else I can do for ya. - Could you send someone up right now? - [Officer] Yeah. I'll send someone up right away. - Okay, thanks. - Yep. - Can I get an available unit? Suspicious activity at the Black Swan Inn. (distorted radio chatter) (crickets chirp) (knocks on door) - Mr. Richards? - Yes. I'm Detective DeLuca with the Tilton PD. - Okay. - So, can you tell me what you saw? - [Doug] Yeah. Let me show you where it is. All right, so, look. I saw her right down over here, by the opening of these trees. - [DeLuca] Okay, why don't you stay here? I'll go check it out. - All right. (crickets chirp) (eerie music) (crickets chirp) (eerie music continues) - Well, I didn't find anything. Here's my info. If they decide to come back, you give us a call. - Okay. Thanks.

(Doug sighs) (wind blows) (siren chirps) Officer. - Where are they? - Out back. I'll show you. (suspenseful music) Right there. - [Officer] Where? - Right down there, by those trees. All in black. - Stay here.

It's right there. It's right behind you. It's literally coming this way. - I don't see it, sir. (indistinct whispering) (music continues) Are you okay? - Weird. She was right behind you. This doesn't make any sense. - Hey, Doug. Just take a deep breath. It seems like maybe you've been going through a lot of stuff lately. - Yeah. Right. - Possible sighting at Black Swan, unable to verify. Over. - [Dispatch] Okay.

Days later, parts of his mutilated body were found amongst the trees and the house, with various parts hanging in the woods, and across the landscape. Sarah and her parents were never to be found or seen again. It is believed that Ms. Moore was involved in witchcraft that took place in colonial Mass between February of 1692, and May of 1693. 30 people found guilty. 19 of whom were executed by hanging, 10 others by various death penalties, and one was never to be seen again.
