My... my name is Chloe Albright. I am a second-year medical student. Yes, of course. Yeah. No, I just... I, um... I don't understand this foreclosure notice. Yeah, no, I spoke to the regional manager, actually, on... on March 25th and then again on May 17th. What? No... No, no, no. I... Yeah, no, I know that, but my student loan got suspended and my dad's life insurance, it never paid out. Why? Because suicide isn't covered. Look, um... This... this house is all that my brother and I have left, OK? No. No, you... you cannot take it from us, OK? If you evict us from our home, then we will have nowhere else to go. Hello? Hello? Damn you. Come on, TJ. Don't ignore me. Do you know '1984' was supposed to be, you know, like, a cautionary tale for us average Joes? Not a... not a goddamn instruction manual for the rich... ..b-bitches that run the show. You know, I mean, they read the book and go, "Hey, th-th-these are some great ideas. "Let's... let's do this." Mind control for dummies. I mean, c-c-can you b-b-believe that shit? And cell phones. Cell phones. That's real b-big brother except they don't need to brainwash us to use them. We pay for the privilege. I mean, cops, politicians, they don't protect and serve us. They protect and serve the hard-cash overlords from us. They sell us the idea of freedom while making sure we never get it. It's... it's all psychopaths who say, "2 plus 2 equals 5," who say the best we're gonna get is... is a boot in the face. Bro! Could you just shut the fuck up? No, no, because if you ask me... Shut... Hey, give me the fuckin' book! No more Book Club, Oprah. - Alright? Goddamn! - Fine, fine! OK! Let's do this, man. OK. We got this. - Alright. - No, whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing, Book Club? You're the driver. You're stayin' here. I... Yeah, no, I know. I, um... You know, I hate to be the one to tell you this. I don't have a licence. You don't have a driver's licence? - Yeah. - Oh, holy fuck. What are we gonna do about you not having a driver's licence right now? I... I... I don't know. I don't know. Dude, guess I'm just gonna have to fuckin' kill you. Whoa, whoa! OK, wait. You said no-one was gonna... Fuck! Fuck you! Fuck! Dude, I could have poked my fucking eye out! What do you think, I got a real gun or something? No, I don't know, I don't know! OK. - Right pedal's gas. - I know, I know. Left pedal's... Oh, you know so fucking much? But you don't have a driver's licence. Yes, I know, I know. I just... Look, I'm just... Look, I'm still getting my cut, right? TJ, I'm only doing this so you get your fucking cut. - You know that, right? - Yes, I do. That's the only reason I'm here. I know. Thanks. Seriously, we... we, you know... ..be... we'd be dead without you, so... - I got you. - Yeah. You just... keep it runnin'. I know. - Just be careful, OK? - Yeah. - Alright? - Alright. Right pedal, gas. Left pedal, brake. Brake. Yeah, I know. Less than a minute, alright? Yeah, just hurry, OK? Alright. Alright. Right pedal... Right. Oh! Shit! Let's go! Start the car! Hey, you punk! Go! - Come on! - Just start the car! - Start the fucking car! - Get out of here! Hello? Hello? Chloe, it's me. - Can you let me in? - Oh. TJ. Hi... Whoa. - Fuck! Ow! - Hold still, hold still. - Shit, Chloe! God. - Yeah, shit is right. What the hell were you thinking? No... no-one was supposed to get hurt. OK? Ross said that it... Wait... Ross? TJ, you... you pulled this shit with Ross? I couldn't do it alone. I've told you to stay away from him so many times. You dated him for three years. You know he's not a bad guy. He's bad news, TJ. - Fuck! - It's out. Chloe! He's not a bad guy, OK? He just... Things got away from him. Things didn't get away from him. He pushed them away. We can't be like him, TJ. - You cannot be like him. - He's dead. I think. I don't... I don't know. It's not easy... ..for me, Chloe, OK? You know, you handle all... You think that this is easy for me? No. No, I did this for you, OK? - What? - OK, I... I know you're having trou-trouble with tuition. And... ..now they're gonna take the house. And I... I just wanted to help, OK? I know how this is gonna affect you. I just... I just want to help. I couldn't just st-stand by... ..and let you go through this, you know? No, I know. I know, OK? I fucked up. I fucked up. Another one bites the dust. Yeah, get the coroner and his meat wagon here ASAP. I don't want the locals looking at this dead hoodlum bleeding in the street. You get a plate on our wheel man? - No plate, Sheriff. - Description? - Ski masks. - Sheriff. We've got a flaming car out on Mission Road. Sounds like a match for your getaway vehicle. Huh. Well, ain't that a thing? Looks like our wheel man's the brains of this cluster fuck. OK, I'm going to ask you some questions, yeah? Mm-hmm. - TJ? - Yeah, yeah. I need you to be 100% honest with me, OK? OK, did anybody see you? No. We... we wore masks and gloves. OK, good. Uh, did you tell anybody about this? No, no, I swear. And the car? What about the car? I ditched it. I... I set it on fire. Fire? That's smart. OK, um... Whose car was it? Stolen. OK, then, you're fine. You're gonna be fine. You're gonna... you're gonna stay here with me. Right? You're gonna... you're gonna keep a low profile. They have absolutely no reason to think that you would... What? What? Ross's phone. What about Ross's cell phone? I... I... It's on... it's on him. It's on him and I forgot. I just... It's... it's... You planned a robbery on a fucking iPhone? - Are they gonna go easy on me? - Are they gonna go easy on you? TJ, it is an armed robbery where somebody ends up dead. TJ, that is 25 to life. But, you know, I... I was only the driver. You were only the driver? You think that matters to them? That doesn't matter to them. And you going to jail, that breaks my promise to Mom. What are we gonna do? We have to get the phone. How? Just give me five minutes. Out here, regional budgets have been cut and so the morgue is pretty much a one-man shop. And the sheriff's department, it's overworked, understaffed. The chief has been cracking down on local meth-heads. According to the news, about an hour before they brought Ross's body in, a girl was killed when her car hit a tree. So we know there are at least 2 bodies in there, 1 coroner. Buys us some time to get inside and find Ross's phone. Won't... won't his phone be with the cops? Not out here. Ross and all he had on him will be processed at the morgue first. His clothes, his phone, everything will be bagged and tagged and locked in the evidence room for the sheriff to claim in the morning, along with the coroner's autopsy report. Walk the perimeter, look for access. Yeah, and I'm sure they have a back door for graverobbers. Hello? I... I'm a friend of the girl who was in the... ..the car accident tonight. I was hoping that I could see her for one last goodbye. Oh, fuck! Oh, fucking hell! Cujo's out back and there's cameras everywhere. Fucking Fort Knox. Hello? This whole place is locked down. The only way we're getting in is through a fucking body bag, you know? - What if that can be arranged? - Huh? What? Do you still score Adderall off that vet tech? Yeah, yeah, you know, it helps me focus. I need you to call her. Hey. Whoa. Who is this? Oh, this is my... my sister. She... she's cool, so... Hey. Uh-huh. - It's 50 for the Addy. - And the propofol? Listen, I got it. But I need you to understand that this shit is... A sterile, nonpyrogenic emulsion, full name diisopropylphenyl. It's used in the induction and maintenance of sedation anaesthesia, and it works by dramatically slowing down the recipient's brain and nervous system. I study criminology and forensic medicine. 150. Come on. No deals today? Shh. Here. So I hope y'all know what y'all doin'. That shit killed the King of Pop. Yeah. OK. Now what? Now it's time to die. How does this, uh, work exactly? I inject it. A few seconds later, I'll be unconscious. The propofol slows my heart rate and brain activity to almost nothing. I'll still be alive. I just have a bad feeling about this, you know? TJ, it is after nine o'clock, OK? By the morning, the sheriff is going to be in that morgue, hearing the results of Ross's autopsy and collecting his belongings. How long after that do you think it is going to take until you are in custody? Once I'm unconscious, you're just gonna wait 30 minutes, OK? What? Why? Because I have to be cold when they find me. Otherwise, they'll... they'll try to resuscitate. Look, TJ, you are going to wait 30 minutes. You are then going to call 911 and you are going to say that you saw a girl OD in the underpass and that you think she might be dead, but you aren't gonna give a name or anything. You understand that? Yes, but as-assuming this works, how are you gonna get out? Let's just worry about getting me in first, yeah? Look, I, um... I should do this. OK? Look, this was... this was... No, no, this was my mess-up. Alright? Let me fix it. You have any run-ins with the local sheriff lately? They won't remember me. Hey. Hey. You know I love you. Don't. Don't do that. OK. Hey, you alright? OK, you gotta go. You gotta get out of here. OK. Love you. It's alright. Oh! OK. OK. Oh... Oh, shit! Sorry. Oh! Oh, God! OK. Shit, shit, shit... OK. Hey, you gonna have Mannix waiting all day? Come on already. Yo, I'm here for the seance. No? No funnies today? Man, this is no way to spend your day. You got a family, dinner waiting for you at home? Or are you too busy breakin' bread with the dead, huh? Come on, man! What do you do for a good time around here? You got a girl back there or something? You know, every time you hand me one of these, I feel like we're going to the beach. Don't you wish there was a sixpack in here, huh, some Kool-Aid, some chicken salad sandwiches? Ooh, there she is. Hey! Take it easy. I'm just checking out the merchandise. Sheesh! Oh, shit, I almost forgot. About that guy in L.A. looking for the liver? Thank God for alcoholic movie producers, huh? Alright, well, let me know if that works out and you might see me again tonight. Lucky fuckin' me. Oh, God. You stupid asshole. Ross! Hey, hey, hey. Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh, shh! Hey. Shh, shh, shh! Shh, shh! It's Chloe. It's OK. What the...? Why the hell are you not in a hospital? I am. Who did this to you? Was it the... the guy with the keys? Was it him? Yeah? OK, was there anybody else? Ross, have you seen anybody else? What the fuck is going on? Chloe... - Shh, shh! - What are you doing here? You dipshits planned a robbery on an iPhone. I know. If I don't get it, then TJ's going to jail. It's not safe here. What? It's not safe here. OK. TJ's going to freak out, he finds out you're alive. I'm going to get to the evidence room and then I'm gonna get you the hell out of here. - OK. - OK, good. You know where the keys are? Yeah, I know where they are. I'll be back. The order came through for our man in L.A. Mannix will be by in an hour. Ross? OK. Hey! I need you to get up, OK? Ross? Ross! OK. Hurry. I know. Look. I need you to come with me. OK? Shit, I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Shh, shh! OK. I have the keys. You need to get up with me right now, OK? Come on. I know it hurts. Shh! Shh! OK. I got you. Good job. Ready? Almost there. Just lean onto me. I know. Shh, shh! I got you... - OK, you alright? - Yeah. Shh! - OK? - Alright. We need to go. We need to go, OK? I know it hurts. They cut you. Hey, hey. - Ross. - Oh! Ross, would you look at me? We have to go. - Now. - OK. - OK? Come on. I got you. - Fuck! OK. You see the door? We're going to get through it, OK? - OK, go. Right there. - Oh! OK, OK, OK. OK. OK. Oh, God. Fuck. Chloe, what did they do to me? They took your kidney, Ross. They what? That's OK, though, because you have another one. Son of a bitch. Got it. Come on. Right now. - OK. - OK. Shh, shh, shh, shh! OK. - Fuck! - Shh, shh! Alright. I'll slow you down. You know you... you just gotta go, right? - I'm not leaving. - What? When I open this door, you are going to run. I still need to get into the evidence room. OK. OK. Almost there. Oh, shit. He sees us. - Chloe... - Shh! Shit. He knows we're in here. - OK. - Fuck. OK. He's coming. He's coming. Hey, hey, Chloe? I'm... I'm sorry. I fucked up. I'm sorry for all of it. I will stop him, OK? You just fuckin' go. Hey. You cut the macho shit right now, OK? You left me once. You're not fuckin' doing it again. OK... I shouldn't... I shouldn't have ever left. Where is it? Last key, Ross. Here we go. We're on the last one. I got it! Ross! No. Ross. Hey, I got the door, OK? I need you to get up. Come on, come on. I need you to move. OK, I need you to come. Come on. OK. Come on, Ross. Ross... Ross, Ross... I doubt he can hear you. OK... please, please, just let us go. I won't say anything to anybody, please. And where would you go? Back to your rat-infested apartment? To your tent city? To your life of crime? What? No. No, that's... that's not me. Then what are you doing here? Attempting to claim that which does not belong to you? Do you think you're deserving of it in some way, that you've earned it? Compensation for the toils and petty grievances that you've accrued during your time on this Earth? Maybe you feel like you got dealt a bad hand and you should be allowed to slip a few extra aces up your sleeve. You ever considered getting a job or is... that completely out of the question? This country's filled with people like you, people who take, take, take. They don't earn. You cheat. You don't strive. You cut corners. You take shortcuts. No, that's not me, though. Fortunately for me, you are all defined by one undeniable truth. All that you are... ..all that you've done, all of your thoughts, your feelings, your beliefs... ..your entire being is worth considerably less... ..than the sum of your parts. No. No, no, no, no. Please, please. Please. OK? You're wrong. I... I am a student and I know the opportunity I have been given. - I wanna make something out... - What are you studying? I study... I study... forensic medicine. That's an underappreciated field. Yeah. Then you already know that there are over a million dollars' worth of assets inside of you. Kidney, heart, liver, lungs, eyes. That's before we get into your plasma, your bone marrow. Even your skin bears a price. You should have valued yourself higher before you broke into this sacred place. - I didn't have a choice. - Of course you had a choice. Just like he had a choice. You obviously know this young man. Caught earlier this morning... ..cutting another corner, taking another shortcut. Look, I know what he did was wrong. I get that. I'm pissed. But he... he does not deserve... Of course he deserves it. Who wouldn't vote to end this wretch's life if it meant saving a more worthy person, a person of value? You think life is essentially fair? Well, unfortunately, life is not fair. I know that life isn't fair. Hey, I know that! I know that... - OK. - And what is your excuse? My excuse? My excuse is that the medical examiner, he determined my dad's cause of death as suicide. But it wasn't suicide. I know that it wasn't suicide. He suffered from PTSD, psychotic episodes and he was heavily medicated. And then the insurance, they cut off his medication... Ah, suicide cancelled the insurance policy and you and Mommy didn't get any money. Sad tale. A common one. - A victim's excuse. - No. No, I am not who you think I am, OK? I got into forensics because I want to help people find the truth, like... The truth is what I say the truth is. Your father was a pathetic loser that did the world a favour by ending his life. And you, when you broke in here, ended your life. You are a sick man. I'm not sick. I'm the cure. No! No! No! Please stop! Please, please, please! Oh! It's OK, it's OK... No, no! No! Ross... You know this used to be the largest hospital in the county? Now it's just me down here. And I do not like uninvited guests. No... Please! No, please. Please, I'm sorry! Please! Shh-shh-shh-shh! Shh, shh. It's OK, it's OK. Listen, listen, listen. Not one word. - Hi, sweetie. - Hey, Dad. Mom wants to know if you're coming home tonight. Oh, no, honey, I can't make it. Daddy's working. Oh. We miss you. I miss you too. I'll see you for breakfast tomorrow. Don't forget to call Brad before school. I won't. Love you. Love you too. - I don't know what you want. - I'm sorry. I'm... Thank you for that. Know that his death and yours will bring renewed life to someone who's willing to sacrifice everything for their beliefs and now, thanks to me, your trivial existence will have meaning. I'm going to give your life worth, piece by piece... ..by piece. No... OK, OK, OK. OK. OK. I'm sorry, sorry. I'm sorry. OK. Alright. Yes. OK. OK. Come on. Please. Come on. Ahh! Eight... Give it to me. This is what this is all about? Some dead loser's cell phone? Just give me the fucking phone. You know, for someone who's a scholar of forensic science, you should know a little more about protocol procedure. We would never leave a live firearm unattended... ..which means that gun is either unloaded... ..or it's fake. Give it to me! Oh! No... No! Damn! Sorry... Help me. Please. I'm sorry. Oh! Ah! Shh, shh, shh! Oh, my God. Chloe. Can you hear me? Up here. I assume TJ is your brother. Naughty little boy, isn't he? In literature, they refer to him as an irredeemable character, loathsome. I'm sure you disagree. I can tell he's had his problems. Probably renders him sympathetic in your view. But to me, he's just a pile of dog shit on a pristine carpet and tarnishing the environment for those of us that are hard-working, those of us that are law-abiding and those of us that contribute. Luckily, the cell phone you've risked so much for holds the key that will imprison your feeble-minded brother for what's left of his worthless life. You know what they call someone like TJ in prison, Chloe? They call them "June bugs". Do you know why they call them June bugs? Because they only live for six months. But I believe you sought to better your life. But your delinquent brother pulled you back into this world and now you are one step away from Ross's fate. Turn yourself in to me now, Chloe. Here she is. Yes. Go find her. Hello? TJ? Oh, Chloe, where are you? - Are you OK? - Yeah. I'm... I'm still inside. Are you alright? TJ... Look, they, uh... ..they hurt people here. OK, wh-what do you mean? I don't know. It's really hard to explain right now. - Chloe... - TJ, I... I think I failed you. I'm so sorry. I can't get your phone. I tried really hard. I promise. - Are you in danger? - No, you don't worry about me. I need you to get the hell out of this state. Chloe, I'm not leaving the state. I am not asking you right now, OK? I... Look, I couldn't save Mom. I couldn't help Dad, and I am not being the one to lose you too, so I need you to listen to me. I'm not leaving you. Chloe, just stay where you are. TJ, now, you listen to me right now. TJ? Hello? I had to cut the line. Can't have you making outgoing calls. Don't worry about him. He's a good boy. He's trained to maim and detain, not kill. Hi. Yeah, um, I'd like to speak to the sheriff. Sheriff. Well, if it ain't TJ Albright. What can I do for you this fine evening? I'll, uh... I'll... ..I'll confess. I just, um... I need you to do something for me first. What's that? I need you to save my sister. Oh, shit. Alright. You want it? You like this? OK, OK. OK, OK! TJ. Slow down there, tiger. Oh, God! Oh! Sheriff! We need to... we need to go outside right now. - Miss Chloe Albright. - Don't... TJ here was bullshitting me. Ooh... It's OK, TJ. What in Christ's name is going on? OK, um... OK, look, the coroner, OK, he... he's... he's keeping people alive, OK? He is selling... he is selling their organs and bits and parts of them and I think he has killed a lot of people. That's quite an accusation this late on a Friday. You need to get in there, OK? I saw him. I saw him. It's OK. Sheriff, he murdered somebody right in front of me. Come on. I never liked this coroner. Old-timer before him, he was easy. This guy's a pretentious nightmare. Yeah, yeah. If he's the psycho you say he is, I'm looking forward to being the swift boot of justice up his ass. Tell you what. You two stay put while I go see what's what. OK, OK. But, Sheriff, you need to be careful. I'm telling you, he's dangerous. OK. Thank you. TJ... Oh! What the fuck?! TJ, TJ, just run! TJ! Dangerous, huh? Well, so am I. Get... No! - Mm-mm, no. - No, no, no! Oh! Oh! TJ! Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh... ..shut the fuck up! - Whoa... - Let's go. - OK... - Get the fuck away from him! Hey, now. Let's not be hasty. Is that Ross's gun? Put the gun on the ground, Miss Albright. TJ, TJ, get behind me right now. Chloe, we should just do what he says. No. No, we are walking out of here. Don't make me kill you. You wouldn't... ..because we're more valuable to you alive. Right? Yeah. I wouldn't be too sure about that. The gun is fake. The gun is fake. Shit. Now... ..this one is real. Changes your odds of survival a little bit, now, don't it? Oh, TJ... I want them alive. Oh, come on, man! You serious? - I just... - Hyah! - Oh! - Move! Run, TJ! Go! TJ, the gate! TJ! - We're trapped... - No, no, no, that's not good. That's not good. That's not good. Bad... dog. - Come on. - OK. Shit! Go! That-a-boy, Mac. Burn 'em down. Go! Let's go. Go. Just go. Go! Go, go! Fuck. TJ? TJ?! TJ! Shit! No! Chloe! Chloe! Fuck! Chloe! TJ! Let me go! Chloe! Chloe! - Get off! - Chloe! Get off me! Get off me! Get off of him! Get off of him! Get off of him! Get off! Come on, get him off! Get him off! Get him off! Get him off! TJ? TJ? - You have to get up. - No, I need a minute, OK? No. Come on. You've got to get up. You've got to get up. Slow down, down. Fuck. Alright. OK, we're trapped. OK. OK, it's locked. We got to break in. Look on the ground, OK? - This will work. - Yeah. OK, OK. - Are you OK? - Yeah. - I need you to twist it. - I know. - One, two... - Come on. - OK, that's it. - Yep, go. OK, OK. You OK, bud? They rattle your brain? Where are they? They went down there. Keep 'em there till we can drive them to us. - How? - Smoke 'em out. Tear gas in my car. What the fuck is that? Mannix. Shit! No-one's supposed to know about me, remember? TJ. Come here. Come here. - OK? It's OK. - I'm so sorry, Chloe. - No. - I'm sorry. It's OK. It's OK. - You're OK. - I'm sorry, Chloe. Hey. It is going to be OK. - Shh! - No, it's not. - No, we're trapped. - Look at me. There is going to be a way out of here. You need to trust me. - Yeah, OK. - OK. - We're a team. - Yeah, I know. Come on. "Wow, look at me. "I'm the coroner. I got keys." Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, open up the door. What's the deal? You're not gonna let me in this time? There's been a situation with the liver. - I lost it. - What? What the fuck, man? That puts us down 100 grand. I'm in the process of replacing it. I need you to come back in an hour. What the fuck is up with your eye? Why did you change this shit up on me? You know Mannix is a creature of habit. You're making me nervous. I'm starting to sweat in places you don't wanna hear about. What the fuck? Is that a cop car? What if he sees me? Oh, shit! You sly motherfucker, you. You got a pig working for you, don't you? That's how you get the live ones. Me and Chase, the pick-up guy in Lancaster, we was wondering about that. Fuck, now I owe him 50 bucks. I knew I smelled bacon. So where is he? Can I meet him? Or her. I'm down with either one. We're all part of the same team, right? It's... What? Ugh! Gunshot. Oh, God. Who's shooting who? It doesn't matter. OK. Come on. Motherfucker! What? You just cost us $100,000. He had a big mouth. Shame we can't sell that. We would have raised a pretty penny. Ow! - TJ. - What? Over here. - Move this? - Yeah. Shh! Shh! Shh! OK. - Can we get through? - Yeah, yeah, we can. Shh! Shh! OK. - You OK? - Yeah, there's just some pipe. - Watch it. - OK. Shh, shh, shh. You shot our contact. You, Sheriff, have fucked us. Not the way I see it, partner. This guy was shot by some intruder. The same punks locked in the basement. They killed him, not us. Can't we just hand over his liver? I don't think they'll accept a liver with buckshot, do you? OK. How about the ones you keep in reserve downstairs? Spare parts from drunks, junkies. Kidneys are OK, eyes are good, but livers are rotten. How about yours? Don't even joke. You so much as raise an eyebrow at me and I will shoot you in the fuckin' face. And what story will you tell? Any one I want. I'll be a goddamn hero, stopping the Calexico Butcher. Might even get a parade. Squirrelly SOB, ain't he? I'll make the call. I'll tell them there's been a slight hiccup... ..but there's a solution in play. What about him? Get the tear gas. We need a liver. I have the item you requested on hand. But you'll need a new courier. Drive it yourself. Transfer me an extra 50. Your rush is not my problem. I'm sorry, TJ. No, no. He's gone. Your man getting blindsided is not my fault. Misfortune is remedied by ingenuity. And money. Deliver in two hours. You'll have your extra. Don't be late. Rats in the walls. Grab his legs. Grab his legs. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on. - Shh, shh, shh! He's... he's bleeding all over the place. Who the hell are you guys? No-one. OK, OK, good. Well, you just saved my ass back there, so that's got to make you somebody. OK, this is gonna hurt. Sorry! Shh, shh, shh! I'm sorry. Get me the hell out of here, I got 10 G's with your name on it. - Make it 25. - TJ. Our enemy's enemy has money. We need it, he needs us. Right? I don't know. I can't think. Done. But Mannix can't be dead. The fuck? Tear gas. OK, uh, TJ? I need you to focus, OK? Focus. Get back... OK, look at me. OK, you need to put this on. - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. - Breathe. Breathe. They're going to come after me, OK? You take him, you go where it's safe and then you wait and then you get the fuckin' money. - No, no. Wait, wait... - Listen to him, OK? I'm gonna be fine. You go. Go, go, go, go. OK, OK. Go, go. There, under. You follow him, OK? Oh, fuck! Dammit! God! Alright. OK. OK. Shh! Shh! Shh! Go, go. - Thanks. - You're welcome. I got her! Nowhere to run, baby. Drop the hammer. Ugh! Shit. Your sister owes me a liver. Yours will do. Chloe? You have completely ruined my life. I can explain a lot of things, but a dead sheriff is not one of them. Looks like I'll have to move on. But before I do, you should know that this pathetic life of your brother's... ..will bring renewed life to three, maybe even four more worthy people. And once he's donated to the deserving... ..it will be your turn. TJ? TJ. Hey. Hi. Hi. It's gonna be OK, OK? I got you. - Behind you... - What? What? Behind you. Hi. Shh, shh, shh, shh! An eye... ..for an eye. No... Oh, holy shit. It's my turn now. Huh! Arggh! Arggh! Take it! You are the sickness. I'm the cure. I'm OK. OK, w-w-we saved you, so... ..you know, you... ..you gotta pay. I saved you back, so... ..seems like we're even. That's bullshit. I still need something. You get it for me... ..I pay you in full. God, I hate that damn dog. Dr Death killed his reserves. No loose ends, I guess. Not that it matters now, you arrogant fuck. Mannix is a bad dude, but that motherfucker, he's gonna be the devil's bitch for sure. OK. OK, she's done. Pay up. A deal's a deal, my man. Nice shirt, man. Huh! Hey, you good? Yeah, I'm better than ever. You need a ride? You need a doctor. There's one where I'm going. Close enough. So can I drop you two off or what? Yeah. - Alright. - You can drop us off. Oh, hey, uh... I almost forgot to give this to you. - Ready to get outta here? - Fuck, yeah.
