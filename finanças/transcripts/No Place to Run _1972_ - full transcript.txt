Okay, Sam, What is that? Hyper watching Nicole? Why? What do you want to know for? You really care? Of course I care But you don't want to tell me. I won't press you. You're pressing yourself hime. You're gonna press yourself right into a heart attack. A bad one. We sit down, please. So I don't have to smoke. You don't have to do a lot of things. Like work. What for you 73 years old? Not yet. You're 73. You said that you didn't hear me. 73 is a nice age to shoot for when you're my age. But once you're there, once you've made it, it's too young not to enjoy. You know what I mean? Enjoy, Sam. I'm a businessman. I've been a businessman all my life. I take great pride in it. I find it very enjoyable. A lot more enjoyable than playing checkers in the park and a lot more dangerous You talk about danger? Did you have a play Checkers with those old thieves in the fire? Like Barry, Cougars will pick your arm over the over. You stay away from them. So Ally What? What are you writing? What's that bills only if you need it. All right, We'll find a nice, cool flesh of them with I'll keep a long, long time. Will you do me a favor? I'm when you take care of yourself. You don't watch out that King is gonna jump your men in the corner, Max Every day you combine, stick your nose in and ruin a perfectly good checker game. Now stop once and sit down and play a game with us I don't trust you. Older people. I know you'll take advantage of me because my grandson's taken care of the store. If I sit around here I'll be out of business by two o'clock. Wait. From the roaring crowds in the War of city faces, who they carry on when they found that way, they better schools. Wait, Leave way! What they do, if they're found a way in the downtown way traded way for a quiet country day way to share. Would they try to find out where way? Wait. What would they say if we are? Wait. Here comes the old man again. Hi. I'm going to see again. What can I do for you today? I want you to move that machine out of there blocking your side again. You have a permit to build here. Not in front of my store Look, I'm I've explained all that to you before. It's just not that easy to move those things. Where would we put it? Don't ask I'm warning you. Next time I call the police. What about my office? Come on. What do you say? What I always say to you, Remus? Nothing. What? It I'll be the last time. 25,000. Making 26. Alright, Twist my arm. 26 5 What do you say to that? Get your lousy crane away from the front of my store. Be reasonable, will you? We both fill that place of yours is doomed way. Haven't seen four people walk in there today. You and the boy at least my way. You'd be getting something out of it. Relax. Begin to enjoy life a little. What makes you think I'm not enjoying life? Okay, okay. We've been all through that, but I just wonder how long this masquerading youth will go on You're no spring chicken. You know, one of these days you're gonna wise up like the rest of the people around here who sold out when they had a chance. We'll talk about it. That my boy, you have a lot to learn. Someday you're going to sell this place to a conglomerate and they're going to put you away in a big, plush office with nothing to do and then mandatory retirement at the age of 64 years, 11 months and 28 days. And then, you know we'll look tonight. Old age is a state of mind, something to which I have not yet allowed myself to fall victim. That will happen in the day when I finally do so. My place Or when I failed to enjoy the look on your face. Every time I turn you down, I am. I'll see that the crane stays out of your way. All right, put it someplace convenient. Like across town didn't help. What are you offering? What do you bath tiles? A fast care. All right. See? 360 just wanted to see you do it. You. That was business. While I was gone booming, three construction workers came in to use the phone. That's good. Now I'm running a telephone service. Did we get any calls? No. But Remus was here already had the pleasure of being with Mr Rina's You told him off again. Did you? Next time you let one of those robots in here I'm going to stick. An oil cannon is here. Two dozen cotton twill. I don't understand you. Hi. This'll Place is dying a slow death, and you pass up a chance to get out with a bundle. It's a matter of the principle involved. But principal, what's the difference? As long as there is a principle involved, I don't understand. I'll take this thought. For instance It's not exactly Macy's, but it's mine. It makes me a living, makes me feel. But Macy says the same thing about his store. Three dozen domestic. How do you compare yourself to him? Why not? It makes me feel, but I'll make you feel good, so I'll compare you to Jerry West. My jump shot's not as good as Jerry West. My story isn't as good as amazing. These people. You don't know a thing about how these people feel you're tearing Doug and time apart. Don't you understand that I'm not tearing anybody apart? Mr Fox. Mr. Mulch did not adopt the boy legally. Has no claim on done. When his son and daughter in law were killed, he should have notified us immediately. He didn't. The adoption proceedings weren't finalized. When they died, Doug automatically became our responsibility. I understand that. I've written to him three times. He hasn't answered me yet. I wanted to the files and I found your name. So if it was an inconvenience for you to make this trip But we thought his lawyer should know we're gonna have to take the boy away. Just like that. Just like what? The agency should have been notified a year ago. I told him to after the accident, I I thought he did. I thought it was all settled. Unfortunately, it's not so, but I'm was wrong. Made a big mistake. Now what are we gonna do about it? Nothing I don't say nothing. We're talking about something very important here. I'm very well aware of that Has made a home for the boy a good home, Mr Fox. A man cannot just walk in here and take one of the Children, no matter what kind of a home he intends to give him. That's why we have an adoption agency. There are hundreds of environmental and sociological factors to be considered. I'm quite well, the least of which of the standards of age and health and Mr Moore scores very poorly on both. And how do you score emotion? What's he accepted standards on Doug's feelings when you take him away? I'm not trying to suggest that this is easy. It never is. But all of this doesn't change anything. We are taking the boy away and returning him to the custody of the agency. Hopefully, we'll be able to place him again very soon. I'll expect to see them at the home on Saturday. I'm sorry it had You made your point. So what if it sticks a couple of people? Let's little blood run Look at that. Robots. 10 men. Oh, brave. No, not even any brains Not just store way. The whole thing is handled. Look at them. No room for a gentlemen. A person with feelings, Chris. With manners. This is what our friend remiss lax eminence Lousy cranes. Uh, enough of my problems What about you? Huh? Tonight is your night. Wednesday. What do you want to do And why don't we just go home? What's at home? Let's go someplace nice. Bowling, Miniature golf. I'll tell you what. We'll take a boat at MacArthur Park. All the things you would put it do. It's my night, but it's always what you want to do. I can't help, but I like post. All right? It's your night. All right? Don't forget. Okay? I said it's your night. Oh, this calls for a little strategy, right? Excuse me. Wait. What? You walk out for the best part's role in the second half, but the best part is in the second half. I'm glad I'm sitting out here. We'll go back. Enjoy. I can't enjoy it with you out here And I can't enjoy it with me in there Six people. I counted them. Six people shop in the 1st 20 minutes. Don't they make pictures anywhere where nobody gets killed? But it's real You call that Really? It's authentic. So where's the Chicago Fire? But I'm glad I wasn't there. I gotta go. My night. Remember I remember. All right. All right. Well, how about some ice cream? No, it's a pop star, but you're still stalling. You're right. What we get? Just the usual bills. So shopping coupons in a magazine. Throw them up. Can I keep the magazine? I'd like to see what's going on on the outside. What do you mean, the outside or you're George Raft. After 13 years in an orphanage, almost You begin to pick up certain ways to talk where you can drop in. George, you're out now. Okay. Hello, J, Is that you? J O J. How are you? You're here in town. What a pleasant surprise. Well, sure, it's pleasant. Whatever you have to say, just talking to you was a pleasure Nonsense. Nothing could be that serious. Why don't have to hear it now? Look, J if there is a problem, there's an answer, and you'll come up with it. Oh, now I'm not alone. Doug is here because he's here All right. Tomorrow is fine. You'll you'll drop around and tell me what you come up with Good. All right. All right. Don't worry. Will you stop worrying already? Fine. It's a legend. What do you want? Nothing important. You know lawyers. There's no problem. They'll invent one. Getting ready for bed. Something the matter then come here. Tell me in here No. Hi. Listen. And you talk if you want. Doug, when you want to tell me what's wrong, I promise we'll find an answer for you. No, I You wouldn't happen to be a customer by any chance. Are you just looking around? That's right. Sorry. You remind me of somebody I used to know. J Fox. Not too good looking. Moved to Seattle. Doesn't even call anymore. You been, uh, find the stadium in shape, like already knew. Well, I'm in trouble. That's what I think. You try to tell me on the phone like I told you. I just wouldn't listen I was listening. I just didn't think there was any sense and crying wolf when you didn't have to not interfere with a good brain of yours to work. Great. You get any mail from the adoption board? You know what they supposed? They sent three letters. I didn't see him. I could tell you what they said. Okay. If you want, go ahead. They want done. I want that. You didn't notify anybody when Cheryl and Joe were killed. It was nobody's business. I could take care of Doug I didn't take care of that time. It's not that simple. Why not? Because legally, he's not yours. The boy lives here. That's possession. So you know the percentages are in my favor. Will you stop that? They're gonna take the kids. No, you stop it. Better yet, tell them to stop. But the boy lives here just like me J you tell them that it can't be that hard. And stop acting like a pull bitch. Please, j do it for me. God knows what's right is right. So, what's the problem Nope. I'm Doug. You're home here? Back here. What's this? What's it look like going on a cruise to Hawaii? Who told you so? This explains why I haven't been getting my mail. You must have known. I would have found out sooner or later. I guess I thought that as long as you didn't know that it really could be true. Pretty stupid and stupid. All right. So now we both They say you don't have to be back until Saturday. What's your rush I'm not going back, Period. What do you want to accomplish? Nothing. Then why? It's a matter of principle involved. What principle? it doesn't matter as long as there's a principle involved Doug. You want to read some of the garbage in these letters looking out for the child's best interest. Ah, proper environment. You got any idea what that place is really like? I mean really, where you planning to go? Oh boy, Canada. I could pass for 18. Most. I'll find work. Why not Mexico? It's closer. I can't speak Spanish. Canada's a long walk. This will get me there. You're sure? What about at night when it's cold? What about food? What about money? What do you expect to eat? Roots. Don't worry. I'll manage. Don't worry, It's a pole order Don't worry. Why don't you tell me? Don't laugh. Don't sleep. What about me? Don't I get a chance to see what I can do about it? There's nothing anybody can dio. How can you be so certain? Well, what can you do? Do I have a vision? How long tomorrow? Same time is now. Okay If it's a question of a home, boy even has his own room. There's no lock on the refrigerator. Even Picks will be watching TV and clothes. He has a whole store full love, understanding, discipline. Maybe too much. Except this Now you understand? There's no reason to move the boy. I would have thought you'd already explained it to him, Mr Fox. No, you tell him. No, please let me hear from your own lips. Why? I'm not fit to raise the boy. What? Essentially it's this Mr Mold. Suppose we did authorize the adoption. What if you became ill and couldn't provide for the boy Or worse? What if he had to provide for you? Why should that happen? Because you're over 70 years old, sir. And that makes you prone to certain disabilities. Just being alive puts you in danger. I don't understand this attitude that judges a man on the probability of the years in front of when the years behind is what really counts They really represent him at the time. He's talking to you. Which would be a valid case if you were 40 but not when you're over 70 Exactly 73. It's all written down there. Why can't you say it 73 in good health, Not in good health. What do you mean? Because you still run a business and you refuse to fall in your doctor's orders, increasing the very risk time talking about. You've been listening to Sam. He exaggerates everything. Well, he's your doctor. You listen to him. Everybody's ready for a wheelchair Unfortunately, we have to listen to him. Well, don't listen to me. I feel fine I know how I feel. I feel good Mr. Marsh, we've examined your case quite extensively. You could have a heart attack become an invalid ID any time, even die. I'm sorry but we simply cannot justify placing any child in your care. I'm not your enemy, Miss Howard You see, the boy trusts me. He's been happy for over a year. Tell me the truth. Can you guarantee anything better? I'm sorry See, with the boy we do all right Together. We, he and I, we make out all right. We do things our own way. I have a lot of years left with him if you leave us alone. But if you take him away, I don't know what's left. There's reality, Mr Moore. Afraid you gonna have to accept it. Tell me something. How old are you? Well, I don't see what that No, please. I'm 27. you have Children, maybe? No, Miss Howard, I have lived through enough reality to fill your life three times. The worst kind ward Death, depression, old age. Now I would like something else. It's a medicine. A little easier to take. Do me a favor. Of course I would. The boy gets here. You explained how to make him understand why he's better off without good. All right, let me give you a ride home. No, I'll walk. You go. We'll go someplace on a couple of beers. Turn back clock Little what you say? No. Well, when you heard me Yeah, sure. I'm not sure about anything. 12. 60. Hey, mister. What is this, the place? Yes my place. Please. Please. That's the world.

Agreed. 30,000 in cash by three o'clock today. Impossible. The papers have to be drawn up. The papers have been sitting in your office for a long time. Three o'clock Oh, hi.
