I'm thinking about marriage. I'm 25 and I think about marriage... which makes me nervous. I've been trying to put it in the context of my life. And life is curious. One of the few things that I know about life... other than it ends... is that it's a good idea to be with someone. With someone you love. My friends are getting married. I don't know what to say. I wouldn't say that I'm a loner. I'd describe myself as a mutt. My mother is half Jewish... and my father is Episcopalian. Not that I spent many time with them. My life up to now has been a search... to make sense out of it and Joanne... has been part of it. She really has. -Jake? -Mornin'! If it doesn't fit I can get you another one. -What is it? -A symbol. -Of what? -My affection! We've been on and off again many times. I don't know what to do. Who do you talk to about it? Who do you ask? A shrink? A priest? I don't know. A member of your family? No. -What the hell is that? -A rock for his girlfriend! You can't leave that in my parents' drive-way. Will we get arrested for this? How is this? Turn around. Work with me. Great! All that gets me thinking if I'm not normal. The fact is that I'm a pretty normal person. I come from a typical New York household. Things were always a little bit crazy. The night of the great black-out... my Jewish cousin got married in a Chinese restaurant. I wasn't aware of it, but that's what everyone did. You met someone and you got married. My father, a trumpet player... met my mother at one of his gigs. I came along soon after. He was a sweet guy, but he was kind of a philanderer. Slob! My mother, from the Bronx, was an emotional person. To say they had difficulties of getting along... might have been an understatement. Bullshit! Where have you been? -At the gig. -Willie... take the baby away while they fight. -What? -Take the baby away... while they fight! It will influence him. We're not fighting, mum. Why should we be fighting? -Where is the soya sauce? -I don't understand. Big time show biz husband... has to come late to my cousins wedding! -I went to get some cigars. -He was with his mistress! Do you think I don't know? It'll influence the baby! Do you think I don't know? For God sake, give me the soya sauce! You must love the cigars. Tell me. Are the cigars good to you? -Take the baby away! -Will you stop that? Do you sleep with your cigars? -Stop it! -Do you fuck the cigars? Stop it! I'm taking the baby! The parents are obviously crazy! -What do you want me to do? -What I want you to do? -What do you want? -I want you to leave. -Want me to leave? -That's what I said. I'm leaving. And so went my father with the black-out of 1965. My mother hadn't thought all this out. What would it be like without a husband? She had a job, but... She got home and called her best friend, Helen. I got my emergency valise. I can stay as long as you need. Candles and... How can I describe Helen? She was a good woman... but she needed a crisis every minute of her life. The two of them never got over my fathers departure. People tell me that I exaggerate, but years later... our apartment had a very strange cloud to it. Turn that thing down! -You act like an 8 year old! -I'm 8 years old! Why do you do this when I'm going out? -You're always going out! -That's not true! Ma! Ma! For God sake! For God sake! We need harmony here! You know what this is? A fire hazard! -A lesson to the family! -Let go, Shirley. I screwed everything of it! I can't keep living like this! I can't do it! -I don't have the strength. -Sure. I need a man! I'm the master of my emotions. I'm the master of my emotions. I'm financially independent. I'm financially independent. I'm emotional, but then I feel the guts of life. I'm emotional, but then I feel the guts of life. -Good little boy! -You're a beautiful boy. He's our little man. Give me a hug. Having no man around, made me sensitive to women. I thought I understood them and knew what they needed. When I thought that I was indispensable to her... what does my mother do? Ship me off to boarding school! She wanted me to play football, baseball... drink beer and play poker... and become the kind of man they complained about. I'm not sure if she was clear-minded about this. I can't leave him! How many times can you change your mind? This man/woman stuff wasn't as simple as I thought. -What do you want me to do? -What I want you to do? -What do you want me to do? -What I want you to do? -This is the best part. -I wake up... and look at the place where my husband is supposed to be. -And I find this note! -What do you want? I find he's gone to the woods to live like a lumber-jack! My father was a lumber-jack. Don't you understand what I'm feeling trying to raise... a family in a contemporary urban environment? It was a startling scene. Let me understand. At the end of the play... the main character becomes depressed... and in a state of sheer desperation... kills everybody who is at the lumber camp with him? He realizes that there's no other way out. He doesn't have any choice but to kill them. You know, there's great writing in there. There really is great writing. But on a personal level... you might wanna talk with someone in health services. Even Chekov could use some analysis. Dr. Finkle was a good guy. I freaked him out 'cause I couldn't remember my dreams. I may not have dreamed at night, but during the day... I dreamed about what every 18 year old boy dreamed about. Jenny Taylor. I'll never forget her. She was this techie in my theater class. We had planned to spend the night together. The first time you have sex is a huge deal. How are you supposed to know what to do? How do you know what's normal? -Did anyone see you? -No. Are you okay? There was a quality to that evening... that reminded me of my mother. You've never been here. I wanted to make this moment... an incredible one that I'd hoped for all my life. Whatever you do, don't come. -What? -Don't come. And that was that. By the time I got to college, I realized... that these hard experiences weren't going to stop. It reaffirmed my intention of using them to make a living. I want to hear something real, that makes sense. Julia, fade in. In the scene, what was the overriding emotion? What was the spine of... What? What is that? I was just gonna get... -Sorry. I'll do it later. -No. Go on. Do it fast. Who's next? -We'll go. -Go and set up the scene. Hurry up. Maxie, spend the weekend reading the scene. Work only on the dialogue. Okay? -What's going on? -Just a minute. I want you to punish it. Pretend it's a member of your family. Not everyone's family is as sick as yours. -You got to get angry. -I got it. -Let's go. -We're ready. Chris, hold on a second. You can start. This is a play about my father. You see... -he was a weird man. -Hold it! That's very good, very good, but you must project. We have to hear each word clearly. What? You again? Just go, quickly. Hurry up! He was a weird man, about 50 years old. Well, that's only a guess. Thank you! -She's looking at us. -She's not looking at us. I'm telling you, she is. -This is not a girl for you. -What makes you say that? That girl is a wasp. You are this New York Jew. This is not a girl for you. She's looking at us. Come with me. -God! -Come on. All right! You're cheating! Hello. -Hi. -I'm Jake Briggs. I'm not a religious person. This is my friend. Chris. -I was an altar boy. -You are...? -Joanne Miller. -I'm Marty. -I had communion. -Really? You've finished? You wanna play again? -You can play with us. -You wanna play? -It's 4:00. -Get out of here. -We can play. -Let's go. She has to go downtown and I have class. Can I walk you to class? -Really? Okay. -Great. I saw one of your scenes. The one of the family, breaking up. It's weird, but I thought it was moving. Moving? Really? That's nice. Was it about your real family? -Sort of. -Really? So you're fucked up. They're kind of unique. My family is a screamingly normal group of individuals. Really? Leaves me in a normal state of mind... which isn't too good around here. The photographs you took aren't normal. They were a little over synthesized. The ones with the kids and the funeral? -They're intense. -My professor said... You can't listen to professors! They're professors! You can't let them influence you. -It's good to be influenced. -Come on! It is! That's what you come here for. They're paid to influence you. I disagree. Well, I'm not saying you should be. You're a little different probably. In a good way. I think so anyway. -I should go in. -Go in? It's moronic, but I should get some sleep. -We've been walking all day. -Okay. I had a nice time. See you around, I guess. Good night. I was wondering... There's this dance over at the ''Advocate''. Would you like to come with me? -Sure. I would love to. -I'm a terrible dancer. We told each other everything after that. Her mother called her a whore... for putting henna in her hair when she was 14. I told her intimate things, too. That I couldn't remember my dreams... that I shoplifted my presents for 3 years... that I wanted to be a boat. It left Chris out in the cold. Joanne and I went everywhere together. Hi. How is it going? I just had a Rockefeller interview. How terrible! I started writing. It was hard not to think of her. And us, moving into the future. I went back to some of my old plays... thinking that I could expand them. But it didn't do much good. I realized it didn't really matter. We were having such a great time. We were talking about moving in together. This was something I really wanted to do. Joanne felt the same way, too. We were a little hesitant, but we were convinced... that we could get through anything... as long as we could talk it through. Joanne and I were great at communicating. We had this ability to talk to each other so easily. Well... -What is it? -I don't know. We made love last night... and you barely said a word since then. -Can we go? -I wanna talk about this. Can we not talk about it here? No one's listening. What could be so terrible that... I wanna tell you something. I can't talk about it here. Come on. Please. -I can't. -Why? Please. All right. I have never... -I have never... -What? I never had an orgasm before. You never had an orgasm? I never had an orgasm. Really? You never had an orgasm? I had an orgasm before alone... but never one with a man before. Living together? You mean, living in the same house? -We're excited about it. -We're totally happy. Well... that's wonderful. That's wonderful. -Ma... -I don't know. I wish you had a father in situations like this. -Ma! -What? What that has to do with anything? Why do you always start about me not having a father? Why are you getting angry? Why? I'm not getting angry. Why do you say stupid things? I don't have a father. So what? Why do I have to hear about it? What's the big deal? Don't be so touchy. I'm just going for a little walk. -You do get touchy! -No. The woman is insane! You should go get her. He didn't mean to upset you. God! I'm not upset. I'm not. I'm a very emotional person, that's all. -You'll get to know me. -Emotions are good. We started to search for a place to live. You're running like a girl! We found a cute house across the street from the nunnery. On the other side was this peanut factory. Everyone said I was insane to think this... but I was convinced that it was driving... the local squirrels mad from the constant roasting. Chris thought that I was mad, but for different reasons. You should be coming to New York with me! It's the last place I wanna be. You should not stay in your college town. Why? What the fuck is really happening here? I'm happy here in Cambridge! Joanne is here, we got a house. This is important. You better write your ass off. -I'm writing a new play. -You better write. -I am! -Write your ass off. I mean it. Hold this. 'til. -Send me the new stuff. -I will. Get out of here. -Send it to me. -Save trip. It's hard to know at what moment you realize... that the work you thought was great isn't so great. The thing that happens is nothing happens. Despite this, I managed to finish a new play. I didn't know what to make of it. I was anxious to send it out. Do you have everything? -Can we please get... -I'm coming! What are you so nervous about? I'm not. It's my mother. She is gonna ride me about getting on with my life. You're fine with your life. Not everyone knows what they wanna do, like some people. Joanne started worrying about her career, too. A lot of the pressure was coming from her mother... but it wasn't making things easier for her. Elliot, I want to introduce you to my daughter, Joanne. -This is Elliot Price. -Hello. He owns one of the biggest galleries downtown. I told him about your photographs. Your mother told me all about them. -Roger? -We'll leave you to chat. Sorry! Mothers! You have to understand. This is the woman who took me... to a career aptitude training center when I was 1 7. -That's terrible. -It was pretty bad. You aren't gonna talk to me about your photographs? -Those? No. -Why not? -I don't think so. -Why not? -I did them in college. -Don't you care about them? Jake! -This is... -Elliot Price. -Hello. -Hi. I was trying to get Joanne... to talk about her photos. She seems reluctant. Really? She did great pictures in college. -Come on! -They were terrific. Dark, brooding... ominous. Don't listen to him. I live with him. You didn't have to be so obvious about it. I wasn't. I don't understand this issue with you. One minute you want to get on with your career... I don't know what I'm doing. He runs a huge gallery. So what? Who cares? You'll be terrific. You go and meet the guy. If he likes you, maybe he gives you a job. I like them. I really do. Why don't you believe them? You're making me nervous. You're making me nervous. Don't be nervous. Tell me about them. The thing was... when I took them I wasn't interested in the pictures. I was working on the idea that I could get... to know this place. These kids were amazing. The pictures were a side-effect. I wanted people to see how beautiful they were. They work. They tell me about the environment and the people. They're honest, heartfelt. These four... this one and these here... this one... and this... they tell me something about you. -I guess. -Your favorite photographer? Mary Ellen Mark. Lunch? Really? He took you to lunch? That's when he offered me the job. -Isn't that great? -It's great! -Hard to believe. -That's great. -He was intense, smart... -Real smart or... -You know, weird. -Good! I'm worried about getting fired. You haven't even started yet! I'm the one that should be nervous. Was there a call about your play? What about Chris? He hasn't called. What do you think that means? Jake? -How are you? -I'm fine! How are you? -I'm fine. So... -So? -So... -I got your new play. It's okay. I wanted to read it again. What do you mean? Did you like it? I liked it. You don't sound like you liked it. I'm not sure it's as good as the other stuff, but... You didn't like it? Just tell me what you thought. This stuff is so much better. It's more from your heart. I'm getting the other play around. It would be better if you were here. Everyone keeps saying: ''Where is the writer?'' They think it's bullshit. New York is the place to make it happen. That's absurd. You're not reading what's being written. You asked me. Listen, I'm here. I'll call you later. All right. Bye. -You okay? -I'm fine. -Want some wine? -No, thank you. Shit! I forgot to call... -''Aperture''? -''Aperture''! About the... -I called them already. -You gave them the figures? They said... Fuck them! You'd be good at anything you do. Thank you. Listen. This is important. Come down to the vineyard for the weekend. For the weekend? I'd love to, but I can't. You must come. Jake likes to work on weekends. We're commited to being here. It'll be great! You can meet interesting people there. I'm sure. It's just not a good time. -Bring him along then. -That would be okay? You spend all week with him and now your weekends, too? It would be rude not to. There're gonna be people you would like to meet. -Writers, musicians. -Meet writers? We could have fun. -You're a little isolated. -Isolated? I should be going to NY. That's what I should do. I don't want you to do that. I want you to come with me. It's expensive to get down there. He has his own plane. His own plane? Forget it! I'm not getting on the plane. That's how people die. I use the house in the winter when the weather is worse. There're only 1000 people on the island. Perfect place for a writer. We're thinking of getting a place down there. Is that Patsy Cline playing? Why? Is this some kind of joke? Don't worry about the weather. I had one emergency landing since I fly down here. Great! Can you land before it blows over? You've written a new play? Jake's written a few beautiful plays. My next one is about Buddy Holly. We're coming out of the storm. -Thank God! -Wanna try a stunt landing? Double roll now that it's clear? It's a great relief. -Don't stop on my account. -Are you sure? You're gonna look at the world in a whole new way! It's wonderful. Terrific. Relax. Look how beautiful it is. I'm relaxed. Look at this house. A house like this on Martas vineyard! -Morbier! -Is this the architect? Looks like it was designed by Mattel. There's something I wanna show you. I wanted to show you the room. -It's a great room. -Yeah, it's a great room. I used to think that one day I'd write my version... -of the great american novel. -I didn't know you wrote. That's the problem. I don't. I wanted to, but... I guess... I put it down to lack of discipline... but I don't have the talent. How do you work? Do you write for a producer? No. That would lock me in to something. I prefer a freelance situation. I see. This is a terrific house. I really enjoy Morbier. I find his designs so... clean. Did you study design? Sure. I love the great architects. This is one of the few houses that Morbier designed. He's better known as a sculptor. Of course. Who are these people? What am I doing here? It's not as if there're any writers here. What kind of writer would come to Elliot's party? Richard Price, Joanne Miller, Ariel Dorfman. You got lucky with one guy, but... What kind of name is Dorfman? We're colleagues. We work together on a book. He got lucky with a couple of guys. What is this garbage about a book they're doing together? He surrounds himself with a bunch of writers... and thinks he needs to write a book! If there were classy writers here... but there're no classy writers here. He's a best-seller. So what? It's advertising. She's got one Pulitzer Price. Satellite image I bring down into my computer. They get sand-blasted onto a piece of glass. The bottom half of the image... took these sonar shots. How significant you are. You american writers need... Don't you find these people a little pretentious? Look! Bill Styron. William Styron. What do I say to him? -Ask his advice. -Ask his advice? I don't wanna be a sick fan near famous people... -You're not that. -'cause they're famous. -I don't even know the guy. -Have it your way. I'll go talk to him. It's just Styron. Jake Briggs! It's me, Shipley. We were in college together. -Theater? -Right! I went off to Oxford on a Rockefeller. -I know. How are you? -Okay, really. You must be on Broadway by now. -Not yet, but... -How do you do? -How are you doing? -Great. I was in Oxford when one of the little plays I wrote... -got done by the BBC. -One of the little plays? Boy! I have to go and slit my wrist. I'll be back soon. In aluminum and there is this mask... Somebody asks you to read something... and all they really want you to say is... ''It's wonderful. I love it''. He should be able to say... ''Read this and tell me it's fabulous''. Should I ask him... Do you wanna know...?'' Just ask him. He may just want to know that you love him. -Nice to see you. -Mr. Styron? I couldn't help but notice you. Maybe I could talk to you for a minute. It seems like you're a little awkward here. I know what it's like. I read all your books. Really wonderful books. Before they were movies I read them. I'm a playwright. I've written a bunch of plays. Excuse me. There you are! -What? -Are you okay? -I'm fine. -We're gonna play a game. It's excellent. I'm just gonna... That was when I thought something could be wrong. Joanne was flourishing up in Boston... and I was starting to sink deeply into quicksand. I felt like a kid again. When I looked at her, I saw an adult. -Do you want anything? -No. -Sure? -I'm fine. What was I gonna do? A traveling animal circus was passing through the island. Hey, man! Hurry up and get in here. Come right in. I've been expecting you. I haven't talked to animals since I was a kid. We don't have much time. Close the door. Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Dr. Oliver. Ever hear of a neurosis by the name of codependency? Point your peepers at that book. Seemingly swinging moose passes a farm... and falls in love with a cow! Too crazy! These two are too genetically different... to sucessfully start a family. It's expected that the moose will give up... and head back into the mountains for the winter. But he never did go back. These are the last home movies just before he died. -Hi. -Hi. -Where is the writer? -In Cambridge... writing another play. -How is it going? -He's doing great. -He lives in Cambridge? -No, he's from New York. How come he's not in this office? He's very envolved with the woman who lives up there. Get him to put his pecker back in his trousers... and come to New York and have a meeting with me. I would appreciate it. He's very talented. He's what I call tapped in. Know what I'm saying? Yes. The play needs a lot of work. It's very long. Yes, but you'll do it? -What? -The play. Get him down here. -Sure. When? -Anytime you want. Arrange it with Gloria. If I do the play, I want you to know now... there's no way that you are gonna play the lead. Don't get too excited. I want to be honest. I would be happy with any... We'll find a small part for you... where you can flash the audience. -Great. Thank you. -My pleasure. -I appreciate it. -Good night. You have to leave today? I wish I didn't have to, but I got to get down there. When will you come back? I'm not sure. Maybe in a couple of days. I call. You don't seem happy about this. It's exciting. You must be excited. Great. -I will miss you. -It'll be a couple of days. Driving to New York... thinking about how beautiful she was sitting on the bed... I had strange hallucinations. You're just like your father! Jake, you got no sense! By the time I got to New York, it stopped. I moved in with Chris which made it easier for me. He lived in a nice building, except it was kind of thin. This is it. It seems thin, but it's big for the price. Not a bad view. I'm so glad you're finally here! -Me too. -You don't know. -You wanna get some dinner? -No. I have to go to this thing. -Make yourself at home. -I'll unpack. -I'm glad to be here. -Great! Fisher should be calling like any second. -He's gonna set up a meeting. -Excellent. There's beer in the fridge. I'm gonna stay, read and unpack. -Are you all right? -I'm fine. Go on. Have a good time. We'll catch up later. All right. -Don't wait up. -All right. Have fun. 90% of the playwrights are out of work. From where I'm standing, they deserve it. If you think you're smart enough... to make a living as a writer, you're arrogant enough... to think that you know everything. That sounds familiar to you, the ''know everything'' part? -Yes. -I thought so. -He likes the play? -Just listen. Relax. If you wanna call it a play, it's poorly structured. It's not drawn out. It's very precious. Bad spelling, not even funny. -But I like it. -Thank you. That's kind. Don't be a wise guy. It's got unique qualities that I like. It's got truth. Truthfulness. That's not easy to come by. What we both are trying to find out... is are you planning on producing the play? The question is... could you spend 4 weeks in a room... pretending like you don't know everything? Yes. -4 weeks? -You and I in an office. Maybe we can turn this into something. -It's what I think it is? -What? Yes. Don't you love his way? ''You're not gonna get the lead''! I loved that! A few months went by before he put my play to auditions. Joanne and I could only visit a couple of times. She told me about the job... that Elliot offered her in Santa Fe. I was upset 'cause we spent so much time on the phone. I'm sorry we haven't been able to talk to each other. -How is Chris? -He's good, I guess. He goes out a lot. I don't see him much. Did you get the pages with the changes? It's getting good. I got them. I haven't read them yet. I want to wait, sit down and concentrate on them. -I'll read them on the plane. -On a plane? I'm going away for the weekend. - Where? -New Mexico. It's nothing. Please. Then why didn't you tell me about it? I only just found out. Can we talk about it? I can't talk about it right now. I better get in to work myself. -Can we talk about it later? -I call you when I get back. Have a save trip. I'll talk to you soon. -Bye. -Bye. -I can't believe it! -Don't start on the boy. Go in to the theater. Pretend like we never said a word. Is this a joke? I can't believe it's Elliot! We all know what's up. What's up? Do you think he has her around for her talent? Everyone's got an opinion about my relationship! That girl is not interested in that skinny Englishman! He's putting the moves on her right now! He has played it cool. He's been swab! Please! Leave the girl alone. Give her some credit. For cheating on my friend? I spit on her a million times! Are you crazy? Get yourself a shrink! Get into the theater! What are you doing out here? Talking to yourself? We got work to do! Get in here! I was on the phone. This is Tile. Mr. Penn, the director... -Jake, the writer... -Not really. Al will be reading. Did you bring a shot? -A what? -A shot. I don't do pictures. I've got some pictures, but not of me. This has been a busy time for me... these last couple of weeks. -Can I have a second? -Go ahead. I've been incredibly sick! I have coxsackie virus. I got in touch with a painful childhood memory. My lover and I are building a... bed of platform. It's me. Pick up the phone. Pick up the phone! Are you there? Pick up the phone. You're not there. -You're making me nervous! -Why don't you take this? Why don't you just go? -Just go? -Go out. -Let's go. -You're finished. Goodbye. -Let's go. -Check out. -Let's go then. -That's the scene. -I want you to go. -That was it? I got to read it. It's good. Luis, I would like to have you try Jake. It's strange, but I would love it. Let's try Jake. Do you mind? I've been trying to reach you all night. He's a great actor, but he's wrong. Why not have a Hispanic as a parent for white children? -I don't think. -You don't want to see any? All right, no more. It's about a little boy. He wrote a letter to Santa Claus. -About the going. -You wanna go? -Let's do it. -You're finished. Let's get out of here! -Get out. -Let's just go. -Go ahead. -Let's go! Go, man. I love it. I love the talent which you seem to have tons of. It's so rare, specially in our business. She's not right for the part. Peter? The play is talented. Very well written. Would you two have time to read that first act again? She's not right for the part. -Shut up. -I think I could. My agent would kill me... for doing for free what I get paid for. Do you know Walter Lobello? I'm Mary in his performance piece. I got to get myself together for it. You're supposed to say... ''You look wonderful... just as you are''. You look wonderful just as you are. Aren't you sweet? Where did you find this talented boy? I have a wonderful idea. Come to Walter's this weekend. He's having a celebratory book thing. You can bring this talented boy with you. Which are you? Man or boy? -I'm parcial to both. -We'll be there. -I may have to go to Boston. -No. We'll be there. Good. Hug me! I'll see you later. I want this role. If you give it to anybody else, I kick your balls. I need to get back to the stage! So... She's not right for the part. It's my first play, but she's not right for the part. There we go again! We got to get people to the theater. It's not like a deli. They don't come in randomly. -I know that, but... -So listen to me. Dana sells tickets. She's flighty, but sells tickets. She'll have to act a little bit, but that's her job. -That's what she does. -Jake's nervous. -Don't be nervous. -Relax! I'm not nervous. The woman's only requirement... is that she's never won an Emmy after 9 years... on one restless world that turns. I can't believe I'm hearing this! Will you relax? I've got everything under control. Just enjoy yourself. I'll see you later. I wish you could enjoy this. -I'm enjoying this. -Relax! -You look lovely. -Thank you. Everything is really insincere. It's fake. I feel more real when I'm out of town. I've never been real. That blow away that I got. I don't know what's wrong. In this world you're either being blown away or... Blown! It's me. You're not home. I'm at this loony party that... Carl brought me to. I'll not describe it to your answering machine. I wish you were back. I think they might be ruining my play. Turn on the TV, stay in the house, lock the door... a piece of cake... Be out in a... I thought you were here. Don't go, sweety. I came to talk to you. Tell me something. Do you have any vices? Want one? Are you gonna judge me on this? I use it to take the edge off. Of course not. I smoked in highschool. Highschool? How cute! Would you? You know... there's some kind of fate that this is happening. Don't you feel that? I just knew... the first time I read the play there was some kind... of inexplicable connection with that role. And Carl? Wasn't he brilliant? Casting me! I'm not exactly the obvious choice. You seem very connected to him. -Have some. -Thank you. I've just thought that you... are comfortable with the role. The truth is... The role... The role is amazing. It's got so much truth. You know, I really believe... you and I will make a beautiful thing together. We used amianthus all over the place. No one ever died for amianthus before. We even played with amianthus! I really need to talk to you. We are rolling now! I can feel it. Can you feel it? I feel it. I'm ready to get out of here. What? What are you upset about? What you wanna get out of? Dana Cole is in your play! This is it! It's everything we were waiting for! Don't get ahead of yourself. I'm not getting ahead. You lived in New York. You already knew about this, but not me. Carl. Guys like that never liked me. But here... it's like... ''You're not gonna get the lead''. I love that! I love the way he says that. Don't you love that? -You're upset. -I'm not. I know you're upset. Don't deny it. What are you upset about? We're going to make it. That's great! We'll always be together. Down the line. I'll always be there for you. Come on. I just did that! Geez! You pull some of the weirdest stuff on me. Why do you pull this stuff at these times? You're right. That was pretty weird. You're okay? I'm fine. I got to get out of here. See you later. Sure you're all right? I'm fine. I'm great. Wait. Just a minute. I have a ritual I always do. I always wash my face. I just take a minute. To be more comfortable. Hold that for me. Who is it? -Who is it? -It's me. Jake? Jesus! Are you all right? What are you doing here? I missed you. I missed you. -I was trying to call you. -I was at the airport. -What time is it? -It's early. You were at the airport? I got in at 1:30. It's 8:30! -I'm sorry. -What time did you leave? Early. I tried to reach you all night. I'm sorry. -What's wrong with you? -Nothing. Maybe I should lie down. I've been thinking. I've been thinking... and I had this totally wild idea. Maybe it's crazy. It's weird... I can't even talk to you about it. Just say it. I think we should get married. Get married? -Are you serious? -Of course. We should get married. We love each other. Yes. What is going on here? Are you seeing someone in New York? No! Why would you say that? Why do you come in here and start talking like this? I know. I came up here because... God! This sucks! This sucks! I'm in New York and you are up here. It just feels like we're not... Things are going by... and I feel like it's not real somehow. I know. It's okay though. You should lie down. You want some food? I make you some pancakes. -I got to get back. -You just got here. I have rehearsal this afternoon. What the hell are you talking about? -It's not working out. -I don't buy it! It's not like you! I know what you think and you're wrong. It's not only Dana, it's me. He's all over the place! There's no way we're firing Chris! Listen! She makes the boat float! Don't you understand? I was about to send the dogs after you. So we have something serious to talk about. Don't talk to me in this position. He can't act. He's emotional. He can't feel the role. How can you fire someone like that? He's good. He hasn't done much, but he needs time. Acting is not a team sport. Neither is theater. The ''show must go on'' business? Bullshit! You must go on. That's my motto. I don't believe this! You come into my life... and totally shift things around. Do you always get what you want? Totally shift things around? If it wasn't for me this play wouldn't be happening. -That is so crass! -Crass? Either he goes or I go. It's late to find a replacement, but try. I don't want to replace you, but this is my best friend. Carl can tell him or I will. I put on my most sincere face and tell him. -I'll do it. -You sure? I shot the play! You think you would have this gig if it wasn't for me? No, you wouldn't! Give me the truth. Is it Carl? Or is it Dana? It doesn't matter. That's not what this is about. Is it me? This must be because I'm gay. I'm not gay. I don't know what the fuck I am! It's not about that. Look, I fought them. You're a bastard! You're a fucking bastard. I didn't think things could get worse than that... but Joanne said that her only chance to meet Mary Mark... was on the opening night of my play. She didn't think she'd be able to make it. But somehow I was hoping that she would. There he is! Hi, darling! -Are you nervous? -Ma, please! -It's your opening night! -Nice stockings! -They're very stylish. -They are. Why should you be surprised that your mother is stylish? -I'm not. Have you seen Jo? -No. Another of Dana's casting ideas was Jason Brett... who longed to get back to the serious theater. He could have longed a little bit longer. I want to tell you how I feel. -I want you to leave. -Want me to leave? I want you to go. You want me to go. I'll go. -Have you seen Dana? -She went out the door. We're going out to eat. Wait. She went out with the director Donaldson. He's doing a play in Lexington. Needs an ancient beauty. They went out for dinner alone. We made plans. I know, but he's a director and she's an actress. Relax, Jake. Come on upstairs with your family. She called him in the middle of the night. Darling! You're a genius! He's a genius! -Mum. -It was wonderful. Wasn't it funny? -We enjoyed it very much. -Thank you. -We enjoyed it very much! -Maestro, that was excellent! Mother, not bad. See you later. -Don't worry, be happy. -I'll see you in a minute. There were many good things. Wonderful. -I'll call you tomorrow. -Absolutely. -Well? -We're going out for dinner. He can't come with us. He has a big party to go to. -'Sardi's', I bet. -Yes, 'Sardi's'. Good night. My God! I'll go to a show tomorrow. See you after lunch. Fuck! I'm not having an affair with my boss! -What was he doing here? -We were talking. -About what? -About... stuff. About what? This is not the way I wanna talk to you about this. About what? About him? About New York? The job? You're gonna take that job? I have nothing in New York. I have an opportunity here. If you live there, something might happen. Elliot said... This makes me nuts! ''Elliot said this, Elliot said that!'' Fuck you, Jake! Fuck you. Why can't we talk about this? Why is your career more important than mine? -I never... -You moved out. You're making this really hard for me. This is not... this is hard for me, too. Leave the room. That's terrific! I was walking around the other day... and I realized... that you're the only person I wanna have kids with. You're the only person I could imagine having... a kid with. -I can't sleep. -What? I can't sleep. I feel so crazy about this. -You always sleep. -I can't sleep now. I'll go watch TV. Maybe I'm hungry. Anything bad on? Shit! I can't believe it! That was the strange thing that happened that weekend. The whole neighborhood is out. Despite my fears of this being another huge black-out... it was just the squirrels who, in their manic burling... had forced the power line to couple over. Helen, what are you doing here? What do you expect? Luckily, I had my emergency suitcase. There is someone you wanna talk to. What do you want? I thought the play would be the start of something. What do you want? You got your first off Broadway play produced. It stuck. So what? The next play you'll write is gonna be better. The one after that is gonna be better than that one. And so on and so on. And one day I'm going to say: ''You know Jake Briggs? I produced his first fucking play. He's making so much money he doesn't even know who I am.'' I know that's gonna happen. You're the real thing. See you. Need something? -No, thanks. -Then stay clear of this. Look. My best side. You want it? I have a copy. I have the original. I like you to have it. Thanks. You have everything? I guess so. I love you. I love you. I better go. Weeks later I really wanted to call her... at least a thousand times, but I didn't. Then I had the first dream I could remember in years. About my father. I hadn't thought about him in years... but in this dream I was in this boat with Joanne. We were stuck on the sand. My father was running along the shore... but I couldn't see him. I got stuck in this whirlpool... but it wasn't a whirlpool. It was a circle. I was spinning, around and around. He was saying something to me, but I couldn't hear it. Then I woke up. I was crying. Then I knew what he was saying. That everything would be all right. Everything would be all right. That sounds strange coming from a man... walking backwards on a beach with a trumpet... but I found it comforting. I read a story about a kid coming home... from a soccer game on the night of the great black-out. He was angry because he missed the goals. He went to this telephone pole and kicked it hard. At this precise instant that he kicked it... all the lights in the city went out. The kid was stunned. He ran home. He was convinced the black-out was his fault... and that his life was over. I don't know how long it took him to get over that... but it has taken me 26 years to realize... that sometimes things just happen. It's nobodys fault. Things just happen. Joanne and me, Chris and my mum. I suppose you got to know in your heart... that no matter what happens... everything is gonna be all right.
