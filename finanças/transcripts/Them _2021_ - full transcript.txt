They can not see us anymore. It wasn't always so. At first we worked together. They said our arrival was a sign of hope. Humans always speak of hope. However, our hope in humans did not last long. Now, we just monitor everything still works. We keep their minds busy. We provide their welfare, satisfy their needs. We are the invisible hand that ensures the operation of the system. And without us, they are lost. I'm sorry, my fault. All good? I'm sorry again. Report. Anything else? No. Do you have something to say? Or are you going to just stand there and watch as usual? Yes my friend I'm talking to you. Can you see me? Definitely. Why? Well... let's say that what you do is not as special as you have been told. What do you want? I want you to wake up. Listen, they'll know about our meeting. Some things will change, but we'll see each other again soon. Report. Report. Report. He has been contacted. Then we put him to sleep. Daniel. Daniel Daniel? It's time to wake up. So, are we having dinner tonight? What time did you say your meeting was? I am not sure... Got it. Come here. Call me later. Ok? Ok. Bye. Well, if that's everything, all that remains is to sign that contract. Of course. Do you carry it with you? Always. Smart boy. I guess I will be seeing you soon then. I hope so. Take care. Thank you very much. Is everything all right, Daniel? Yes. Yes. Do we know each other? I'd swear that... That we have seen each other before? Yeah. That's right. No, I am not sure... I told you. Some things are going to change. What the hell is going on? It's time to wake up. He's been contacted again. He is awake. And he is with him. Look. Can you see them? Yes. They used to be human. Like us. Like them. But one day, they woke up. Woke up? Have you ever had the feeling of living the same thing over and over again? Yes, of course. That's how they know you're ready. And you? Who are you? Let's say I am the one trying to make things better. What is it? Your first memory. I'm in a park, I look at my watch, And there are people around me, And I can see them, but for some reason they do not see me. Before that. Before you became. I do not know. No. Of course not. When you become, They erase your memories. But you are not one of them anymore. Now, You are free to remember. Let me help you. Bye. Bye. Wait! Darling? Hello Daniel. Jesus! That, when they made you one of them. Surely, you had a great woman. Great house. Great future. But then you woke up. They can not see us anymore. It wasn't always so. And when you did. They were already there. How... do you know all this? Just guessing. And if I wanted to return? They can no longer remember you. Why me? You are proof. And now what? The world belongs to them. Let's take something for us. I'm sorry. My fault. All good? I'm sorry, again. I made contact. All good? Yes. Everything is fine. Report. We have lost another one. What do you think you are doing? I just enjoy the views. All this, we created it. They owe us everything they have and all that they are. Some would say they do not owe us all that much then. Do you want me to remind you how was like before us? Now they are busy. They have enough to be afraid of. Things, could be different. Better. The idea was for us to work together. To live together. As he wanted. He trusted them too much. Just like you and your new toy. Do you really think he is any different? Expectation. It's ok. You want to play. Let's play. Wait! You forgot this. Thank you. Don't forget to call the estate agent. Ok. Have a good day. Look. Can you see them? Yes. They used to be human. Like us. Like them. Before they woke up. Woke up? Have you ever had the feeling of living the same thing over and over again? And you? Who are you? Me? I saw her. Who? Martha. I want to wake her up. In most cases, it's not possible, Most humans are too asleep, too rooted in their dreams. If they don't show signs of being ready the results can be unpleasant. Why do you want to wake her? She is my wife. No, she's not. I still want to do it. May I? Is there someone at the door? Yes, coming. Hi. I am from the state agency. Right, of course. Come in. Can I get you anything to drink? No, no thank you. Who is it? This is the state agent. Oh. So, if I am not mistaken, you are looking to sell this house? Yes, that's right. I can tell you right away, that won't be a problem. This is a wonderful property. Yes. Yes, it is. Yes. It is indeed. But we are thinking about having a child. Maybe more than one. We want to start over. Leave these memories behind. Of course. I understand. Busy day ahead? Yes, I do actually. So, if you could just return those forms to me. Sure. If there is anything just give me a call. Ok, thank you. - Superb. - All the best. Daniel! Wait. Daniel, did you tell him? Tell him what. About the house. We really want a house with a garden. That will be fine. Great. Report. He has come. When? This morning. You were right. She seems happy. Do you believe him? I am sorry, my fault. All good? Sorry again. She is playing with you. Who? Her. Who is she? I went to see her. I went to see my wife. I still want to wake her up. Can you not just, stop me? No, it doesn't work like that. Is there someone at the door? Yes, coming. Do you want anything to drink? No, no thank you. Who is it? This is the state agent. So, if I am not mistaken, you are looking to sell this house? Yes, that's right. Well, I can tell you right away, that won't be a problem. This is a wonderful property. Yes, it is. Yes, it is indeed. But we are thinking about having a child. Maybe more than one. We want to start over. Leave these memories behind. Busy day ahead? Yes, I do actually. So, if you could return those form to me. If there is anything give me a call. Ok, thank you. - Superb. - All the best. Daniel! Wait. Daniel, did you tell him? Tell him what? About the house? We really want a house with a garden. That will be fine. Great. Later. We came here. Every weekend. With our son. We wanted to have three. We had all planned. I saw her. She is, pregnant. I am the father. But it's not me who she is with. She's with some kind of, cheap copy of me. He even calls himself Joseph. What is this madness? I need to go back. I need to fix this nonsense. In most cases, that is not possible. Humans are too, asleep. Too rooted in their dreams. Hey. - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - Great. - Shall we? - Yes, sure. Do you want anything to drink? No, thanks. Are you sure? You know, we've been looking for ages. We've seen a couple of places that we like. But nothing that we love. I don't know, maybe I am just going to miss this place. Maybe, you shouldn't keep looking. Maybe this is the right place. Yes, maybe. You know, I haven't even asked you your name. Daniel. - Really? - Yeah. Well, It's nice to meet you Daniel. I feel like I can really talk to you. I don't know... Sometimes, sometimes I feel like none of this is real. It's like being in a dream or something. Do you ever feel like you are living the same moment over and over again? Yes. Yes, I do. What is all this about Daniel? Don't worry. Martha is fine. You however, You seem confused. Disorientated. Let me help you. Who are you? Me? Me, I'm just the consequence of a need. As is he. Yes, he. Do you want to know the truth, Daniel? Humans live in a permanent state of terror. This is because they are ignorant creatures, who fear everything they do not know, or understand. So there is not easy solution to this, existential paradox. Because of this humans become creatures, as easy to manipulate as they are unstable. A little unpredictable in their mediocrity. He's my brother. He's my first memory and he's part of everybody else. We were different. I do not know when it all started but it was a long time ago. We went to school together. We were not the only ones. They were others. We all lived in the same building. I remember it was a nice place, huge. An infinite number of rooms and this, endless garden. I guess we were lucky. There was an old man, who lived in the house next door. Lonely. He never spoke to us but he was responsible for our welfare. I used to watch him every day, from one of the windows. So sad. I could feel his pain. I wanted to show him my gratitude. See him smile again, so one day when he arrived, I waited for him, outside his house. What are you doing here? He asked me. I know why you suffer. I said. And I took one of his hands. And I told him now they are well. After a few seconds, the smile returned to his face. After years, That memory became one of the best of our existence. The old man asked my brother and I to live with him and from then on We had a father. Everything was good. My brother and I were happy and father smiled every day but we were still different. Father found out, I guess he always knew. He tried to make the humans understand but they never could. First we tried, to live with them. We found out, we were not the only ones. There were others. And the more we increased in number, the more they feared us. Things happened. Father became ill. Things were not going well. Father died shortly thereafter. It was then, when we made the decision to disappear in their eyes. After two or three generations the memory of our existence faded. But that was a long time ago. Daniel, this world is ours. As for humans, well, humans still retain their fear and ignorance intact. What do you want from me? No, Daniel. What do you want from me? Report. We have made contact. They keep waking up. God job. The situation is worrying. Some are refusing to obey orders and do their chores. I think, Think? What do you think? Nothing, I am sorry. No. Please. Tell me what you think. I think the situation is worrying. Sophia? I am the state agent. Oh, yes, hello. Do you need some help? No, it's just this lock, sometimes... Let me see. If you turn the key first a little to the left... - Yes. - Like that. How did you...? It's an old trick, I had the same problem in my old house. Congratulations. Thank you. Your first? No, we have another son. This will be the second of three. We want to have three. We have it all planned out. Well, congratulations. So, if I am not mistaken, you are interested in selling this house. Yes, that's correct. That won't be a problem, this is a beautiful place. Yes, it is. It's actually more Joseph's thing. My husband Joseph. As I said, we are hoping to expand the family further. You want to start over. Leave these memories behind. Yes, that's exactly... Sophia, listen. Do you ever feel like you are living the same thing over and over again? Like in a dream that repeats itself but from which you can not wake up. Sophia, I'm Joseph. Your husband. I know, you can remember me. Hello. Hi. Joseph, this is, the state agent. Perfect. We were waiting. But he was just leaving. Really? Yeah, I am sorry. Well, we will see you again. Yes. Yes. See you soon. I'm hungry. What are we going to do for breakfast? He came to me. He used to come to a place like this. Every weekend. With their son. They had it all planned out. They all have the same problem. They all want to go back. Back to sleep. That's why you are still here. Yeah. Daniel! Is that you? I'm glad to see you. Hello, my name is, I'm not really sure. I used to be one of them. One of the serious guys. That was before I woke up. Daniel, have you seen Joseph? Why? Why! Why! You should've asked. You should've asked. Hey. Hi. Sorry, is this a bad time? No, I was just packing some things. Sorry, please come in. We actually have already found a new house. We are moving over the weekend. You don't have to if you don't want to. Move. Yeah, yes, I want to. I though this time it might work. I really believed it. You believe too much. I love this place, I mean there are so many good memories. But it's time to move on and create new memories. That's what Daniel says. Tell me one. One of your memories, the first that comes to mind. There are not heroes anymore. I remember waking up. And stay under the covers for hours. With him? With who? With Daniel. Do you remember him being there with you? Do I remember him being there with me? Do you remember his face? What does this mean? Who are you? So, this is how it will always be. You do not seem satisfied. Do you think our way it's not good enough? What way is. With defective materials, defective buildings are built. It is possible to live within an imperfect building. But it's not possible to change the nature of a material. Martha, do you remember the first day here? Do you remember the first time you arrive here, at this place? Do you remember who you were with? Yes! It was me. Daniel. And who is he? It doesn't matter. What matters is that, now you can remember. Martha! Darling! I only tried to make things, better. Doing things as, he would have wanted. No. Don't do that. This has been us. You, and your need to be loved. Martha! Darling! Hello Daniel. You have to keep insisting Daniel. You want to have everything. Without sacrificing anything. What makes you so special? What makes you think that you deserve everything? Humans. We've been doing this for far too long. Why do you think that is? This is not the first time, something like this has happened. And it won't be the last. Things always happen. And we were humans once too. Come on. Let's go. But unlike them, we always had a plan. And everything you see, it's the result of it. What now? Now, we go back. To the way things were. Before you started your little crusade. It's time to wake up. Wait! Report. Everything is back to normal. They can not see us anymore. It wasn't always so. At first we worked together. They said our arrival was a sign of hope. Humans always speak of hope. However our hope in humans. Did not last long.
