I'll be like Man I'm fucking crazy but yet I got the inner peace Everywhere we go people want to know Who we are and where we come from We are the Hebrews mighty mighty Hebrews I'm a Hebrew Israelite. A Hebrew, as a descendant of Abraham and an Israelite, as a descendant of Jacob. And the great savior appeared among the children of Israel, in the countries of the United States and have brought us up out of the lands of the captivity to the promised land, to establish the Kingdom of Heaven or the Kingdom of God, on earth. How many rules are we breaking right now? According to the law and commandments, how many rules are we breaking? Here. Let's take us out of the equation. What was our parents' mission? I'm gonna tell you what was our parents' mission. Our parents' mission was to come here to establish the Kingdom of God. The Kingdom of God, meaning to go back to the bible, go back to our history, go back to our founders, generations and generations, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, go all the way back, go back into the belief of what we really was, we was in exile, in slavery, America is slavery. I don't consider myself part of the community 'cause I'm not living with them. But I was born into the community, so you can't take it out of me, you can't separate me from the community 'cause I was born into it. You was born into it. You were in the community, you represent it. No matter where you go or where you're at in this world, you're still a part of the community. I feel like that's the same stuff that just got us messed up. Keep telling us about, y'all were slaves over here, y'all were slaves over there... Man, I'm finished with them stories. All I can basically remember is getting out. Feeling like I'm inside of some type of mental and almost a physical prison like where you can't leave, you can't go, you have to be here, you have to do this, you have to wear these clothes. And you know that we went through the same shit in Dimona, but you got another problem that you got sexually abused, you know what I'm saying? We got physically abused, I know I got physically abused today, I can feel it. Would you say you've been abused in life? Abused like getting beaten? Yeah, I got beat Abuse is abuse. -I don't call that abuse. But that's what... Did you get beat to the point that blood was coming out of your damn leg? One time. -Okay. That's abuse? Or that normally happens to people at about the age of nine? Did it harm me in life? Is it stopping me right now in life? Nobody wants to be that person. -No, I moved on, I'm gonna go backwards, I'm gonna let that pull me down? No, I'm gonna let it build me. I'm gonna let it build me, it's gonna make me a stronger person, I'm already a stronger person. I'm gonna tell you straight up, you're riding a bike on your story that you ain't never get off it, you ain't putting it behind you, you ain't moving on, you don't want... Because he can't put no shit like that behind. You get a fuckin' dick stuck inside your fuckin' ass and think that at the age of 30 you're gonna get over it. No, no, no, I'm gonna go to it, because you're over here telling me that I'm riding a bike, I'm riding a bike that I can't manage to get off of. You tell me... You tell me, is it possible to actually get off this bike? It's possible? Let me tell you something, the reason why I choose not to have children today is because I've been so fucked up inside of my fucking head I don't know what the fuck I'd do. I don't even want to have a damn baby right now and the baby is coming out, but I know I won't ever touch the baby, 'cause that's my kid. I can't become a perpetrator. I can't be a person that got disrespected and then come out and do it to somebody else. What I'm trying to tell you is that the closest ones to you, those are the ones that actually get to you. I wouldn't bring a child molester to my house, okay? And that's what I'm trying to tell you. You don't know the child molester is a fucking child molester until it's after the fucking matter! Nobody knows the trouble I've seen Nobody knows my sorrow Nobody knows the trouble I've seen Glory, Hallelujah Your hair is cool, it's real soft. Yeah, you gotta be looking a certain kinda way. The priest is back! The high priest is back! This is my daddy, when he was actually a cop. Chicago Police High School. I was an officer. When I graduated, I was a captain. How is it, to sit and smoke with me after 27 years of not seeing me? That's a good question I always wanted to know. See, I heard... Well, I didn't even hear, I saw the video. 'Gospel in the Holy Land'? And for some reason everybody telling me I sound like you, I have a deep voice, I could never go into the choir. I got this crazy deep voice. Why don't you sing something? Like, I didn't hear the song, I just seen it, why don't I get it in live? You see, it goes... Thank you. -Yeah buddy. So you still got it. The actual fact is, you're the evolution of me. Your name is Ahfrahn Bolling. My name is Ahfrahn Phoenix. Let's get this right here. I know who you are. Your family name is Bolling. Your family name is Bolling. -Yes. -My family name is Phoenix. You want me tell you why my family name is Phoenix? Because that's what's written in my passport, that's what's written in my birth certificate, that was written the day I was born. I never took your name. I took my mom's name. And I love the fact that I have that name, Phoenix. That explains it all, everything about me. Do you know what a phoenix is? I'm sure you know. -Yeah, I know. It's a damn bird that crashes against the earth. -Crashes and burns. Burns! -Yes. But still has the courage and the ability to come back to life. Nobody knows the trouble I've seen Nobody knows my sorrow Yeah nobody, nobody knows about these troubles I've seen Glory, Hallelujah You got a cutting board here? -Yes, I have a cutting board. Yes, I have a cutting board. Now you're the parent, and I'm the child? I'm definitely not the parent. -Okay, so I'm not hungry. If I was the parent things would be played out different. So what's been happening? Do you know that this dialogue and this conversation might get deep? With a lot of crazy questions? -Okay, we'll see how it goes. But you have to answer the questions. You don't have to do nothing... Thank you. You answered for me. I don't have to do anything, but as my mother used to say, "Live, die and stay black," nothing I can do about those things. -Tell me, Who is Zerachia? Zerachia? Zerachia is an individual that I for many years thought was a close family friend, almost like a brother and who I found out had molested you as a child. You call it molest or rape? What's the difference? Or is there a difference? There's a big difference. -There's a difference. It was rape. Okay. And I learned along the way that Zerachia had a problem before he ever came to Israel. There were some incidents in Chicago. Some of the brothers really didn't want him to come here, but it had been decided to go ahead and send him to Israel, saying, okay, if anyone can save him, if anyone can change him, it would be the Kingdom of God, so called "Kingdom of God." Did you know this before I was born? No, I didn't know before you were born, I didn't find out until years later. The reality is that if I had known, you would never have spent time with their family and I would never have been associated with their family, spending holidays and allowing you to stay there, none of that would have happened. It never crossed your mind that I was acting weird? It never crossed your mind that maybe something is up with this little boy? No. It didn't. It didn't. In retrospect, I can remember conversations that we had, I can remember things that you said that should have been triggers for me, like all the time when your stomach used to hurt, and you always wanted me to rub your stomach, that should've been a sign for me. The one time you came and asked me something about sex and I told you about all people having sex and you covered your ears and you didn't want to hear it, that should've been a trigger. You chose to not want to believe it because he was a family member? You probably were close to his wife? -Not to believe what? Whatever it was. You didn't want... you weren't really too busy thinking about what could it be because of the relationship you had with this particular family at the same time. No, that's not what it was. I was put out of the community because I took a position. I was condemned for supporting you as your parent. I was condemned because I took a position that I'm not going to sit by and allow this, I'm going to speak about it, which wasn't allowed, I'm going to accompany people to the police station, which wasn't allowed. So, what you're saying... One way or the other, Ahfrahn, whatever it is that you do, you do. I don't like that name, you know I don't like that name. Okay. Well... Do you know why I don't like the name? Why don't you like the name? Maybe I forgot it. -Forgot it? I don't like that name because, that name was being called when he asked me do I wanna give him some sperm as drink. Okay. He was always, "Ahfrahn, you wanna give uncle some white milk?" That's fine and well, but then still. I never liked that name because of that. Your problem in life is proving to yourself that you're not tripping. That's the biggest problem. In the army I acted real strange, real, real strange. As long as there were soldiers in the shower, I wouldn't go in. Not because I was afraid or because... I remember what I went through, but because something didn't feel right, being in the showers with a man, something was wrong about that. And when I was in boot camp I often went to Jesse's (Zerachia) house. I knew he lived in Dimona, we're relatives after all, but whenever I got there I had this strange feeling and he also behaved strangely towards me. He was like, why did you come? How are you? I miss you. But it was more this look in the eye as if to say, I wonder if he remembers? And if he remembers, what kind of person is he, will he talk? That's the feeling I always got from him. Listen to it, real fast. I'm the craziest person in this community. It's about to be mad. Y'all crazy? Your dad was one of the greatest priests, all right? They'd turn to your dad straight up. Look, you go and approach Ben Ammi. For Ben Ammi shouldn't have been messing with Bat Zion. When he approached Ben Ammi, Ben Ammi turned around and said, look, "get out of my face", kicked him out of the priesthood, sent him to America and then cursed his oldest son and that was you. That's what happened. Can I please pick you up and take you downstairs? Man, come on, man, let me live, man. He can go downstairs by himself. I know he can, I just always was a person who used to be rushing. Slow down. Thank you. How you doing? I'm doing excellent, man. I'm in the Holy Land, can't be... Can't be no better, man. I wanna laugh, but I don't think it's funny. It wasn't funny to me at all that after 27 years you rolled up and to tell you the truth, I didn't think you were actually rolling through that door. In my head I'm like, this nigger made me come way to the airport and then not even on time coming past the door. We get to the point, we're going upstairs inside the airport to see where's the bag, did you ever get on the plane, was this a joke from the beginning? But you rolled in and the way I looked at it, like, why would he come back? For a certain amount of time I said, why did he come back? He came back for what? It's a hard thing for a man to be part away from his family. That's a real hard thing. I didn't leave, man, I got marooned over there. With that being said, that's true, you did or you were marooned, but you did leave. What year was this? 1988. So that means I had to be three and a half when you left. Do you know that the minute you left... Did you know about Zerachia? Zerachia is my perpetrator. The person that I put in jail. What's the possibility of you knowing that he was a pedophile, a rapist and molesting children, before I was born? What's the possibility of you getting kicked out because you and two of your associates actually had the courage to take him to the mountains and stone him to death, but yet Ben Ammi (community leader) stopped you and said "let God deal with it"? What's the truth in anything I just said? -All truth. He sent me up there to counsel Zerachia. -Oh, damn. Okay. Okay? -I didn't know that part. He sent me to counsel Zerachia. The pedophile, the perpetrator. -Yes. -That ruined my life. -Yes. He never admitted to me. I don't know if he admitted it to Ben Ammi, but he knew exactly what was going on, because what he did was the same thing he tried to do in your case. Slide it up under the rug. And the part about the brothers taking him out in the mountains, they was going to take him out there and kill him. It wasn't they were gonna go out and beat him up, shave him, they was gonna kill his ass. Matter of fact they came and told me what they was doing. Okay? And I told them, I said, hey men, that's gonna bring among us some... -Trouble. -Trouble. Okay? You tried to stop something and then you got kicked out and then because you knew too much he (Ben Ammi) kept you out like, you lost contact. -Right. -And because of that, after you left I got cursed. But you know what? All of the young brothers, they came to see me since I've been here and all of them say the same thing, when they be sitting there and we be talking, they all say, Man, you and Ahfrahn, you look like the same person. That's why. 'Cause every time they see you, they see me. They got an old song I used to sing all the time. Que será, será Whatever will be, will be The future's not ours to see Que será, será What will be, will be So the answer to your question is that it was inevitable that this would happen. Now you see, I let you have my horse. I usually don't do things like that. But I let you have him. That's your thing? -Yes. The first time I told the social worker, I think I went through something when I was a child, and when I told her Uriah's name, she was like, "Ah, Uriah, everyone knows. "He did that, he did that". And I remember my daddy for years telling me, "That dude is a pedophile." Like, people knew. As a child from the nation I don't know what's a pedophile. I'm hearing the word, but I don't know what that is. It was really easy for the Israeli community to say that we're a closed community. She was like, "We know what's going on, "but we can't penetrate your community. "You have your security, your ministers," she knew the entire hierarchy. So she said, "All I can suggest is that you leave. "Once you graduate from high school, leave." And that's what I did. You're 34. We make the moves now. They did everything in their power to try to break us down, but it won't happen. No, I think I'm really broken, with the community and the government, I'm broken. I'm still stuck there. It's like, I can't break free of that place. I often felt guilty for what I went through in life. As a man I ask myself, did I enjoy it? I look back and try to imagine a man blowing a little kid. I want to see sperm emerging from a man's body without getting pleasure from it. And because I'm remembering it now, so I mostly blame myself. Maybe I enjoyed it. But it wasn't you, don't you understand? The body reacts, the hormones... That's why I asked you if you feel guilty because a part of you enjoyed it. -Yes and no. Yes and no. But you can say no today because you know what it was about. You didn't know back then. And as far as you're concerned, it's something every kid goes through. It's something that... Everyone, she went through it, you went through it. -Exactly. It wasn't such a big deal. -It wasn't a big deal. Only when I grew up I realized. At that age you convince yourself that you knew and even if I didn't, my parents should've taught me and even if they didn't, a person is supposed to put a stop to these things. Then you ask yourself, why didn't I stop it? Often you forget that you were just a kid. Wake up. This can't be the last time at all, it can't, it can't... I had to drink beer and smoke just for me to come and see this. No, you ain't going nowhere, buddy, it's... You're not, you're not, not at all. Yeah, you just sleep for now, you sleep. Continue to sleep. You ain't going too far away. Not at all. You're here. You ain't going nowhere. You started off something some time ago. I promise you to finish it. Because I remember everything that... I remember a lot of bad things, that happened with my uncle. All he's trying to do is put fear into you, so it will be our secret. That's what happened all my life. He didn't have to convince me, he didn't tell me if it was good or bad. He didn't tell me to keep it to myself, it was all me. The trauma was so hard that at some point my brain erased him. Although I knew... I was still a kid, living my life, I kept moving forward. Only in my twenties it surfaced in nightmares and things like that. And only then it suddenly hit me. The same night, I had the courage to call him. When I called him, I didn't ask him if it had happened, I asked him "why me?" "I'll tell you the truth, "you know you used to walk around the house, "wearing your pajamas in the summer." And he told me "you used to heat me up." Do you know how stupid you sound? I'm still a kid. You got heated up on a kid. He's lucky he's in jail because I wanted to kill him, to be honest. I was in his house with all his kids, Friday night, my rifle behind me, he's in the same chair he sat in when he played with my balls Friday night in the bedroom. I was so close to taking his life. Hi, sorry to disturb you. When I lived here 15 years ago all this was one apartment. Damn, this is crazy. This is Jesse's (Zerachia) apartment. Jesse stood here, actually, right here. His back was to me, even when I stood over there, talking to him, telling him I had a weird dream. He asked "about what?" "I dreamt that someone actually sucked my cock." So he said, "For real?" He didn't even turn around. "Really?" "I guess that's a crazy dream. You had some weird dream." That's the last thing I said to him about it. That was the last time I said it and the only time I said it. He was standing right here. There was an unpleasant situation here too. But I'm not there. I'm not there because some things I'll take with me to my grave, no matter how often I talk about it. Zedakia the Priest. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to know this great son, Zedakia the Priest. Everyone say: Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah. God lives, God lives, God lives. Forever. Thank you, God Thank you, God Thank you, God Thank you, God Thank you, God Thank you, God Thank you, God Thank you We're thankful, grateful and most appreciative for you continue to bless, share, create and give. Thank you, God Thank you, God Thank you, God Thank you, God Thank you, God Thank you, God Thank you, God Thank you You definitely said this is Marshall Bolling's son sitting here, right? The apple did not fall far away from the tree at all. The apple is still on the tree. What I'm trying to say is that just because my daddy is gone, does not mean that the battle actually stops. The battle is now about to begin. We've been inside this nation 40 years, 50. But what have we accomplished in 50 years? You walk anywhere in Israel and you ask one question, who are the Black Hebrews? And the only answer you get is: Amazing singers, people who know how to eat right, people who know how to respect God and live under him. But, us here, us here, know exactly what's really going on. How do we stop it? You got to understand, the priests were not anointed to serve anyone but God. We were not set up to serve Ben Ammi. -Never was. We have to understand that the nation was not set up to be Ben Ammi's kingdom. We say this is the Kingdom of God. As we continue, it says in Zachariah, those who stood in the name of God looked around and they said why is this evil continuing to seemingly prosper? And God told them, don't worry, I got this. I got this! -That's right. It's about righteousness. That's what his name was, wasn't it? -Yes, it was. The righteousness of whom? Of God. The mistake of the ancient priests was that they did not stand for what was right. -That's right. You got to stand up for truth. I don't care who is at fault. Then it's the responsibility of those in positions of leadership to deal with it, if they don't, the blood is on their hands! And they will pay! -Oh yeah. They will pay! Evil will not prosper in God's Kingdom. Evil will not prosper in God's Kingdom. We didn't come 7,000 miles to be called "Kushim" and be niggers. We came here to be a holy people. It's got to change. -It's got to change. And it's gonna change when we change. When we stand up for what's right. You know what's right! Do it! Hallelujah! Don't let nobody tell you anything different. This is the season of new beginnings. This is the season of change. Sit down. Chill. Hello. -Hello, Minister. Who is this? -This is Ahfrahn, Priest Zedakia's son. Hello, how are you? -I'm all right. How are you doing? It's a lot going on inside the community in general. I've been trying to get down there for the longest and they keep on pushing it back, Minister Elyakim, Priest Abir, they keep on pushing this meeting back and Minister keep telling me to be patient and it's all right, and I'm like losing patience, because I'm really upset that I didn't get the opportunity to get my dad there and even though I got my justice in life, it's kinda hard for me to continue knowing that things still go on. I want to do everything I could to help, but without going to the cops or whatever else the way I did the last time with Zerachia. You know what, maybe I'm a bit naive, you know what naive means, right? Absolutely. I'm 32 years old, if I don't know what is naive... Maybe I'm a bit naive, but a lot of things that you're saying this is the first time I've heard of. I was the only person out of 40 years who managed to have a case against the nation, not even against the nation, against my perpetrator and end up winning it. I'm talking about people who actually raped children, molested children and everything else under the sun but when we come and talk to our community about it the first thing we say is that, let's let God deal with it. And the victims, basically, we have to walk around the nation looking at the same pedophiles and not knowing what to do. With your help and my help together, could we put our brains together on working on something? All right Phoenix, like I said, I have to think about it. I still say, keep your focus on everything, especially that new baby you got. Yeah. -The future she got in here. The baby mama is giving me problems, she took the baby out of the hospital and ran away with her basically, I'm gonna take a couple of steps back for like a week or something at the most and see what happens after that, maybe she'll chill out, maybe she'll cool down. How is it, you're still with the nation? You're still here, you work for the same body of people. You might not agree to half of the shit they do, but you can't even write a letter to even get the information that I need. I can't do it and I don't care who says I have to do it, who says I need to do it, who wants me to do it. I have to be comfortable with the decisions, with every decision that I make as a person. We can't make it happen if we have people like you who won't even... who won't even write up a damn... I gotta control my words because I'm really furious now. I'm not even angry, it's far beyond angry. It's... I'm hurt, I'm pissed, I'm mad. I was once that fallen soldier. I was once a beat-up child in school, I was once picked on, I was that person. So you want to help other people. I want to help the weak that can't help themselves. What makes you think they're gonna let you do what you wanna do? I can use Sara... Let me finish. -What makes me think... First of all, she's the official liaison from the department of social services with community. How many is it? One or two? -She's the official liaison... How many Sara is it? -She works with a group of people From where? -She works right here at the women center. From where? Who are these people? They all white or they all black? Now what do you think? -They all white. -Okay, so what? So this is what I'm trying to tell you, one Sara not gonna help a body of black people, at all. What makes you think your one little black self is gonna do something by yourself? The problem is that I don't think, I know. At the end of the day, you don't believe that I can do it. I didn't say that, I'm not saying... -I'm asking a question. You're twisting the words, 'cause that's not what I meant, and not what I said. A lot of people were like you, Mom. They don't have no belief, they don't have no belief that one person can come and make a change. I have been with you every step of the way. I have in no way turned my back on you. You still with this fucked-up nation, how the hell you think you part of me? You helped me in some ways... -I'm finished with the conversation. So this is where it come to? -It's your choice. Everything is about a choice. It's your choice. It's your choice. It's your choice. All right. Look Anat, you gonna hear so much shit today, it's gonna be wonderful. Gabriel. Gabriel! That's the son of the... of the pedophile. That's his son, over there. The tall one, the most black, who actually wears black. All I have against his father, I would take it out on him now. Just like that. That's the childhood we shared. But, let's carry on with our day. Come out of your tent, come out of the shade, put down that glass of lemonade. We need everybody to take their places so that we can start the opening ceremony at this time. Which means, immediately. Which means, now! 50 years ago, without hesitation, Ben Ammi the Messiah followed a 45-second vision, so today we celebrate because we're happy! We celebrate because we know who we are! We are the testimony of 50 years of redemptive accomplishment which we have manifested both near and far. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! God lives, God lives, God lives. You want some watermelon? You know who told me to come to his tent and talk to him right now? Who? -Brother Aliel. I said "I just got a question to ask. Fuck what I heard. "I want to ask you in person, 'cause I don't want to judge nobody." He's like "come to tent right now, I'd love to talk to you". What do you think? Mom! How you doing? -I'm doing perfect, can't ask to be better. -Okay. Let's not get into details. Whatever happened, happened. The point of it is that, I kissed her and I touched her inappropriately, I touched her on her breasts, and so I could've denied it like so many other people, there's been a lot of situations in this kingdom, I'm gonna tell you what's the difference between you and Zerachia. You know how to take responsibility, he don't. Plain and simple. I did this and it wasn't right, so there's this committee... I'm gonna tell you a lot of facts you probably don't know. When I came to the committee in 2009, the same committee was the people who said, keep it within the nation, let God deal with it. This was in 2009. I'm gotta tell you, it messed up my life, I had to go to rehab. I don't have a bullet around my neck yet, but I took my own life and the bullet got caught in the chamber. So I chose to put it around my neck. -Yeah, yeah. I can't be a person who overcomes and then continue with my life. No. I came here in 2009, y'all turned a blind eye? All right. You're only gonna make me go crazier. It's all right. I'm gonna call you. Too many people is looking and I'm looking at everybody else. I ain't trying to have that energy. But me and you... Ahfrahn, Ahfrahn, don't ask no questions about no old stuff. With all due respect, all right? You can't do this. We'll throw your ass out and you'll be in jail. Today! No, we're gonna take care of this right now. -Let's do it then. You're threatening everybody. -I ain't threatening nobody yet. The police is here. Ahfrahn, Ahfrahn, Ahfrahn. What? Listen to me, listen to me. Ahfrahn. Listen. Whatever, whatever. Oh yeah? Yeah? You gonna be like that? Watch this, nigger! -He's gonna make a mess. Why you gotta call me like that? -'Cause you come up here like you tough! You motherfucking thing here! You got me? Get him off the park. Get off of me. -You're making a scene unnecessarily. This is not what I envisioned when I signed on. I didn't envision the children not being a part of. I didn't envision the drugs and alcohol. I didn't envision the division. I didn't envision me not being a part of. It was time for me to move on and cutting my hair was part of that release. Just letting some things go. Let go of the anger, let go of being mad at people, what happened, happened, it shouldn't have happened. But, like with Ahfrahn, he's not a part of the community, but this is where he grew up, this is his life, this is his culture. I don't like what happened to my family in Dimona. That's what I don't like. And that's part of my reason for not wanting to be here. The only reason that I'm in Israel right now is because my children are here and my grandchildren are here. There were stages, it started off with many things. It's not like it happened one day and the story was over. It happened many times a week. Friday evening "Let's go to Yeruham Park". Tuesday, "Come home early, before the others come back". That was he's day off work. So, In the beginning, most of the time, I had to penetrate him. See? But sometime it came down to "Can I penetrate you?" First time he tried, I stopped him, and told him that it hurts. Look, at the end I told him that it hurts, so he simply... He... he stopped it because he knew that sometime he will be able to. I'm simply a kid, so he's taking his time. See? That's how it started. Well? I forget where I was, it took me somewhere else... Last week the social worker called me and said "Jesse is supposed to get out of jail." Like, brother Zerachia probably getting out of jail sometime next month. "Do you mind him getting out of jail? "Hell no, he can't get out of jail. Leave him right up in there." His next visit is in 2020, so I managed to stop it. He was supposed to get out? -He was supposed to get out. Like out of jail, free? -Not out of jail, this ain't Monopoly. You don't do shit like this... -How long did he get? He got 12 years, but 18 on paper. Good behavior, then 12. 12 years ain't shit. 12 years ain't shit. I'm just saying though, he got like... Look... Like... Ain't nothing shit, even if they killed him that ain't shit. Because it ain't gonna be able to change whatever he did to you. You know, even if they killed him. -No. But I'm saying, 12 years would definitely give him enough time to sit by himself and think about what the fuck he did. And not only that, it's gonna give the people around to understand that we're on to your bullshit, so that this won't happen again. Go out. Come on. Are you done? Let's go. Is that you, Shlomo? How are you? I'm taking the dogs out. Is your sister home? Shlomo. Is she home? Open the door for a sec. Can I just wish her a good Sabbath? Can I hold her? What's up, sweetie? I want to ask you something. I deserve to see her once a week, I deserve to take her out of this house to meet her family. That's what matters to me. I just want my baby to be happy and know that she got two parents, period. You can't say "the baby is mine, the baby is not mine", "I will take a DNA test, I will not..." But me and her mom aren't together. -It doesn't matter I don't want to fight over the baby with her. I know she's angry at me, and that she wants to raise the baby, I know everything. I don't want to disturb her. Get outta here, get outta my house. Get out now! -Phoenix, give me the baby. She's my baby. She's not your baby. Take a DNA test like you wanted to. Get outta my house. Get up! I'm calling the cops, I mean it! Get outta here, you scum. Come. Come. I just held her in my arms! My plan was to say "good Sabbath" to my daughter and I did it. No one can take this moment away from me. No one, I swear. I'm high, I just think about it, I can't even stop smiling, I swear. I feel like I conquered the world. Yeah, totally. How are you doing, Mom? I'm just giving you a heads up that I'm inside of a jail cell. I basically stopped past her house to see the baby girl and for some reason she called the cops. Now, she told the cops that I threatened her and for some reason the cops actually told me to come to the police station and then what happened was, they ended up arresting me, like, straight off the top. And then just throw me inside a jail cell and tell me to wait. Like, for what? But I'm gonna call you tomorrow and I hope you answer. I'm gonna talk to you. He's a little imp in this picture, he looks like a little... like a little devilish little kid, like, "I'm up to something." You know, since I don't know when it started, I look and I try to figure out, was it happening on this picture? When he was this age? As a mother, how do you not protect your children? And even though I know I didn't know, I did not protect my children. If I had, Ahfrahn wouldn't have gone through what he went through, his life would have been different. But... it was a lot. It was a lot. It's the same thing all over again. All over again. My dad disappeared when I was... one and a half, two years old. She has barely come into the world and in the first minutes she only saw me once. That's the most painful thing here. My child was born last Friday. I lost my father on Saturday. I buried him on Monday. On Friday it's my 32nd birthday. Today. Do you know how it feels to come to this park after 16 years? I'm really bursting with pain. I know that where I'm sitting now, that's the place. Whether I say it is or it isn't, or it's over the other side. This is the place. It's totally surreal, but take me back in time and tell me to repeat my life, I'll still do the same thing. Including. I wouldn't remove him. He made me who I am today, a strong, black man that can raise an army by himself and come and put something pure right back from the place I came from. If it wasn't gonna happen to me, that means it would have continued, it would have continued, but it happened to me for a reason, that's probably why they call me Phoenix. I deserve it. I deserve to be happy and I'm gonna be happy. This is the dead part of me. Once I leave this park, I just get back up and continue. So, yeah. I'd do it all again. Ready? Go! -Let's chop some shit up! What's the name of the song? It doesn't have a name yet. -No name song. I wrote it last time I saw my daughter who was born a month ago, and I was put in jail. So I wrote a song about it. This right here is a song to my baby girl. Last time I saw you this is real talk. Your daddy feels you. Real talk. Last time I saw you all I did was kiss you Every time I walked pass all I did was miss you Found myself in front of the judge like hell what's the issue I only kissed my baby girl you sayin' that it's illegal Last time I saw you all I did was kiss you Every time I walked pass all I did was miss you Found myself in front of the judge like hell what's the issue I only kissed my baby girl you sayin' that it's illegal Go freestyle. Check it. Freestyle only. Let me take a minute and ask the world a heavy question How could you sit back and relax and let a whole entire nation Continue to avoid the real truth of a dark place I can't call home Because it killed you with a small rape This is real shit no tears rolling down My real name is Ahfrahn roll with a nigger called A.J Don't open up that door Let me show you how I play My mama told me not to curse on the next rhyme So I had to do it on the first time This is freestyle... This is crazy, Bro! God damn! Yeah, we gonna kill it. We gonna kill it! Let's lay an album out for these niggers.
