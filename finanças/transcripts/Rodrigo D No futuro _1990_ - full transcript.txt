OK, good luck. Hi, what's up? - Are you alone? - Sure, come in. - Here's what you asked for. - Thanks. How did it go yesterday? Quite good, yeah real good. Who did you talk to? Tell me about your job. There's no job, I just got the money. But with who? Why don't you tell me about your job? Why do you have to know? You know I hate it when you ask me about those things. Don't you? Can't you tell me what is it that you did? No, no, you don't need to know. OK? I don't want you asking about that. OK? OK, if you want that, I'll never bring it up again. What's up, bro? They took John out from his house. - How come? - In a jeep with no plates. They took him away this afternoon, what a bummer.

You know aunt, this is too hot for me. I'd better go away, camping. This is so rough. No man, that's too much suffering for a poor mom. You never think about us. Any time they're going to do that to you. Don't you say that, don't jinx me. You know I don't like nobody telling me that. I really don't like that. That's why I'm telling you. It's for your own good. You know what? Let's just forget about that. No. Hello. Hello. Don't smoke that here! Nobody comes up here. The old man might. No, he's busy downstairs with his own things.

Look at him, the one with the blue shirt. Yeah, I've seen him. In a year he'll be up to no good. Sure. Cops are more afraid of kids cause they're so agressive. Yeah, we just get them and shoot them immediately. And they fall with the first one. But when they catch you... ...they'll torture you do whatever they want. A little kid will never go yellow on you... ...but those fags... ...they all get yellow... ...unless they're a big bunch. Sure. Look, there's Orion. - Where? - There with the three stars. - That's so cool. - The legs, shoulders and head. Orion, mighty warrior with all his strength. That's a beauty, isn't it? - That should be ours man. - Look, he's leaving. - Really? - Yeah look. You know what, we must jump on him when he leaves. But what time is it? I don't know man. Old man, what time is it? - It's almost eleven. - OK, man. Thanks. You're welcome. How are we going to pull it off? Don't worry, tomorrow I'll ask Adolfo for his gun. But I have to give it to you... ...because with this outfit I'm too flashy. Why don't we steal Adolfo's gun? We can always say that the cops took it. You know what you're a real slime bucket. I get along with him just fine. He's my buddy. Don't be so itchy. Did you think we really were going to cross him? You're a real scum bag, you can't be trusted. Yeah, sure. Roll that joint and let's get stoned. - Sure man. - There's nothing more to it. Sure. [The wires in your head, the straitjacket on... [... none of that will save you. [They won't save you because I'm going to kill you. - Can't you sleep? - Nope. - Would you like warm milk? - No. How about herbal tea? Nope. This late they upset my stomach.

Put your legs down, honey. - Cesar, what's up? - Hey, hi. - Do you work here? - Yeah, I've been here a while. Make me some drumsticks. Do you already have the drum set? No, but I need the drum sticks. You know what, they'll cost 400 pesos. - Are you crazy? - Crazy? Why, man? - I'll give you 200 pesos. - No way, man. To tell you the truth, I'm just a workshop assistant. So who do I talk to? Let's see, you should talk with that guy. Talk to that guy over there. Me, I don't get involved in those things. I just work. I just wanted to make some extra bucks. But he'll charge you the same amount. OK, cool. [Money. [Problems. [Money. [System. Hold it Javier. - So what's up? - Everything's cool? So you got the drum sticks. That's cool. - Where did you get them? - In a carpenter's shop. They're awesome. This dude is going to get himself a drum set. - Ain't that true? - We'll see about that. Sure. Hey, we're heading for the hills. - Where? - To the hills. Sure thing. I'm bummed out with John's disappearance. Did you know? - He disappeared? - Yeah. - What happened to him? - He was taken away. Taken away? Right. They came in a jeep for him. Are you coming? And I'll go for my bike that's nearby. So we all go, you can ride with him. - Wait here. - All right, I'll wait here. Cool. The drum sticks are awesome, bro. [How can... [... I calm myself? [I reject all. [I no longer... [... get any... [... satisfaction. [... satisfaction. [... satisfaction. [... satisfaction. [Not even with drugs... [... nor alcohol. OK, fag turn around and I'll toss the coin. Turn around. So, you're not obeying. OK, turn around. There it goes. - What's up? - What's up? - What's up kid? - Everything's cool. - Look out after my bike. - Sure thing. Look at that, a punker going swiming with a jacket. Going swiming? Have you gone nuts? I'm not going swiming there. Not a chance. If I do I'll do it butt-naked. Sure thing. Not using those fag swimsuits. - They look like your sister's. - No way, they're your sister's. She already became a hooker giving her pussy all around. Fag. Watch it! Pictures are a total giveaway. Yeah dude, a picture is a total giveaway. For sure. If they catch you, because it can always happen... ...it's a total giveaway. And in the end a picture is only a memory. What's the use of that? Stop horsing around, dude. You're a real pain, you'll get into trouble for been a pain. And for been so childish. You know what, this guy has a luck, this size. You haven't been killed yet because you're fucking lucky. Because you're a real nuisance. - You know what kid? - Don't pull my hair. If you shoot to the head... ...aim a block down. You should aim to the chest. So you'll hit the head. Listen to this asshole. A block? How many blocks do you have? He has a complete avenue. Anybody can make mistakes. And people shouldn't butt in. OK, that's cool. Stop bugging me man! That's why you'll get into trouble. For being such a pain. In the end I cut the head out of all my pictures. I've eliminated all of them. In the end they're nothing more than giveaways. Yeah right, in the end pictures are no good, dude. Anybody can rat on you and they'll point you out. - You're right. - They're no good. - But you know what man? - Nothing like weed, dude. Sure. But you know what? Specially nowadays. You're always looking over your shoulder. And with December being so near. You know, in December you start missing your friends. You know, I've also been thinking. I'm going punk all the way and chill out on the stealing. - Not a chance. - I'll stay home, lay low. The All Souls Day is about to come and you may end up... ...being a soul. That's why I'm telling you, you just be a punk... ...and lay low in your house. - Sure thing. And on December 31st you can end up being... ...the doll they burn. In the end it's better to lay low in the house. Those days, everybody's trying to knock you down. Because the noise of fireworks help cover up. Thanks. So you SOB, everything's cool? What's up? Are you hanging out here amidst the trees? - What's up, dude? - Everything's cool. Those sticks are for what? Are they for masturbating? - Sure. To play the drums. - Are you a drummer? That's cool. Hey, look out! These two are going to kill themselves. OK, dude, come and get it. OK, dude, come and get it. Look at him, he fights like a fag. Come on, leave me alone. Let's start again.

Yeah, he's dead. A goner. He has had my bass for a long time. - Why don't you ask for it? - I haven't seen the asshole. That fag has had my bass for two months now. - Punk ass kid. - Shut up, bastard! - What are you doing here? - Listening to them, and you? I came here to see if they let me play the drums a bit. And those chicks? What are they doing here? They are a couple of head bangers that want to... ...play vocals with the band. First, this part. Then the chorus. Then that, and the chorus. And that's it. Yeah that's the whole thing. - Quick or slow? - Quick, as fast as you can. - OK. - Let's try out, OK? No man, I think not. Now I'm into other things, I'm into classical music. - That's hard. - Yeah. But we can jam together a little bit afterwards. If you invite me, sure. - They'll let us jam a bit. - OK, good.

Sure, this place is much better. It's in a high place and nobody comes up here. But this little patio is not very safe. There's no place to hide. You have to scram downhill. [There's a dead guy here. [Who knows who was it? Hey kids, what's going on over there? They found a dead guy in the brook. Bummer. You know what? I finally got her in bed. She's a real slut, isn't she? - What's up dude? - Everything's good? Listen up man. What went on with our deal? Didn't I tell you to drop by at eleven? Don't you give me that crap. I was there at eleven... ...and you weren't around. You see? That's why things don't work out, dude. OK, but you know what? We're here for a reason. Let's not kid ourselves. You think we're stupid. OK. Tell you what. We have a job. - What's the deal? - A Mazda. The car already has a buyer. - Can you hide it? - It pays 500.000 pesos. Yes. Everything is planned. You'll go on a bus, with the guns. I'll go over with this guy on the bike. OK, we're on. We'll meet on 33rd street, by the bridge. Keep the details. Hey, two beers. Cold! [Money. [Anguish. [Money. Who's driving the car? I'll do it. Not a chance. Hold your horses. - I'm driving it. - Yeah his driving the car. OK, he drives the car no problem. - Sure. - Sure. Do you have Mrs. Nohemi's number? Why are you going to bother over there? What's it to you? Mind your own business. I know why you want it. To talk about our mom. You've been so strange since she died. Stop playing with those sticks. You'll ruin the furniture. - And you can't pay. - What's your problem? I'll pay for them. Yeah, right. Make a party out of it. So we're having a party? OK, then. Yeah? You want a party, let's have one. Fat-ass bitch, idiot. Had to be a woman. And what are you good for? - For a lot... - For fucking nothing! - You're good for nothing, man. - Women are such farts. Such big farts and men still come after us. Yeah, to calm down our sexual desires. Well, so why don't you do it with your own hands? Hit it, come on hit it. Hit it. Hey, kids. Leave the rat alone. Hey, kids. It hasn't done anything to you. OK, scram. Go now. I want to see you scram. Chester! Chester! Chester must be with the guys. Chester is really crazy. He had this place all messy. I cleaned up a little bit. Those posters weren't here the last time I came. You know my cousin is kind of morbid. There's a couple of those magazines here. - Do you want to see them? - Another day, not now. - What? - Not now, another day. What's up? They called me from the curia. - Yeah? - Yes. For a job interview. To work over there. - I've been practicing... - Don't work. ...on the typewriter we have at home. - Don't work. - What are you talking about? I need to work. - What? - I need to work. That would be better for us. We can help each other out. It's been days since I saw you so beautiful. This is so great. The cotton panties. You're wearing the panties that I wanted, the ones I like. - Yeah? - Sure. You, as always enjoying the water, aren't you? Do you enjoy sex with me like with the rest? But you know what? I think that you, when I make love to you... ...you're not satisfied, you need someone else. Somebody else so you can finally feel satisfied. Isn't that true? I feel you still have the desire, the urge... ...like you want to... - You always say the same thing. Every time we are together you say the same thing. You now what, that's what you need. - Your cousin, the little brat... - With my cousin or whomever. I like a lot of people, but I love you. That brat is not able to make you happy like I do. Do I have any type of obligation to him, or what? You know what, Vilma. You have to promise me... I know I'm going to die. After I die... ...you won't have a kid with that man. Why do you have to think about dying... ...or me fooling around? - That's how it happens, love. That's the way life is, love. Do you think I don't want to get married to you? Let her go! She's not yours! This fag, motherfucker. Stop the racket, you fag! - Asshole. - Come my love. - Don't go fighting now. - Motherfucking asshole. Shit! Those assholes really took a long time. The baby is in the car! Take the car but give me the baby. - Stay still. - No, no. Take the car but give me the baby. Go, go, go. - Give me the baby. - Get lost you cunt. Get lost bitch! Look man, look a little kid. Oh shit! No, man. That's too much heat. Get rid of him. Just get rid of him. That's too much trouble. Just drop him there. Watch it! A watchman let's move it. That was cool! [I'm the enemy of Allah. [AII I do comes out wrong.] That's so cool! You know what pisses me off? I think they saw your face. I'm telling you. No way, nobody saw me. Do you know what happened? You told me to get rid of the kid. He meant money for the two of us. I think they saw you. When you ditched the kid. Too bad, man. I thought that broad had something valuable here. - She doesn't have anything? - Nothing. - Look at this. - She was nothing but looks. What's this? Money? Look at this. This is cool. Make up for you. This is great! Light it up! This car drives well. Don't you think so? I'm going to roll up another joint. So, where are we taking this thing, man? To the client, wherelse. Or wherever we can hide it. - What's up Cipri? - What's up? - Everything's cool? - Yeah. Are you playing? Maybe. Yeah? I don't know if these guys let me. Will you give me music lessons? One of these days. And to play the big cymball? Will you teach me? I'll teach you everything. For 150 for each class. Do you play by notes or how? No, by ear, but I'll teach you the notes, 150 per class. - Hey Mendoza. - Hi, kid. - Everything's cool? - Can't complain. - Everything's cool? - Can't complain. Where are you going? This night I'm selling these little figurines. Come here and have a sip. How's your cousin? Can she walk already? She's walking, man. You know what? Hold this. Take these 3.000 pesos and go to sleep. Don't go around selling that shit. OK, thanks man. - See you around. - Good luck. Gustavo! Tavo! OK, then you man. Mr. Federico had a stroke and he's ill. Go find Mr. Hernando... ...ask him for the bus to take that man. And you go with him, OK? - Where? - Wherever you have to. Come down now and go. This is the dog's life, man. Yeah, and at the end there's no honor among thieves. Like this guy's brother. A brick fell on his head killing him, and he came back. - How's that? - Yeah. A car crashed in front of the house. A bunch of snoops climbed onto the terrace... ...and my kid brother was underneath. The whole thing came crumbling down... ...and a brick fell on his head. - So what happened? - They were keeping vigil... ...and the SOB came back to life. - And that man only told me. - How's that? Yeah he only tells those who believe him. That he saw himself from above. That he saw a lot of things. Listen at my father. Whenever he gets on a bus... ...he starts singing. What an embarrasment. I learned these excercises in Bogot?. That drummer taught them to me. Hey Rodrigo. Did you also learn these excercises? They're good. One of these days I'll go and hear you play. What are you singing, Mr. Filiberto? It's called [Because of You]. - What does that mean? - You are the cause. You know a lot of English, don't you? Enough to get by. So what's the meaning of... This is your house. Welcome to hell my friend. - Aunt, aunt. - What? - Aunt. - Adolfo, what happened? Aren't you supposed to be camping? - I couldn't take it. - What are you doing here? I was so happy because... ...you weren't here exposing yourself. I want to go out with you for a walk. I was bored. I'm Ionely. I wanted to go for a walk with you. Let's go out, smoke a joint and eat bread. At this hour you won't find any bakery open. But we can still go for a walk. I'm happy doing whatever makes you happy. Great, let's go aunt. I've been Ionely... But we won't walk for more than an hour. Don't worry. We won't see the dawn. Put on some shoes, and we'll go out. This way. Look Mr. Hernando. Walk down straight this way... ...then turn over there. I think they'll tend to you quicker here than in the ER. - Thanks a lot man. - OK. - Rodrigo, where are you going? - I have to do something... ...maybe I'll come back later. Instead of growing old? I don't want to grow old. I don't want to be someone. I don't want to live the same live of slavery than the rest. - Let's smoke the joint here. - No man. What do you mean no? - No man. - Let's smoke it here. No, they'll end up throwing you over there. You know what? What's going on with us? That I don't like... ...the fact that you went there... ...and in the end... ...you found out what was going on with my dad. That you arrived and found out everything. And you shouldn't have gone there. You're not the one to be complaining to me. I had to know what was going on, and how to solve it. But you shouldn't have gone there, aunt. You know what bothers me? That you're complaining to me. Take it easy, aunt. I just want you to be happy and feel good. And you do that by making me mad? Let's calm down and smoke a joint. No. I wont smoke that. Roll it and smoke it, not me. Not with the hunger and laughter attack... ...of the last time. Forget it. Imagine that again. Look, son. What's going on at Maruja's? Look! Hey, Luz Mila. What's going on at Maruja's? They found John's body, they're keeping wake. Say what? This is the music that John liked the most. That's why we're playing it, and that's why we won't cry. You asshole. Thank God you left you lucky dickhead. You did all good. Us poor bastards are still here, brother. Mary, are you sad? Don't you think John might come back for you? A friend of mine... ...had a daughter, and her boyfriend promised her... ...that when he died he'd come back for her. And a few days later... ...she was dead for three hours. And where was she? Well of course with him, don't you agree? Remember, dead people always keep their promises. And what the boyfriend promises her girlfriend... ...well it's a sure thing. What are you doing here so late? So sorry Mrs. Nohem?... ...to bother you so late. But I was nearby with some friends and it became late. I was wondering if you could host me tonight... ...my mom told me that I could always come... Antonio, look this is Rodrigo, Lucy's son. Is he? You look so much like her. I bet you're an artist. - No, no. - Do you want something to eat? Just a glass of water, please. While you speak with Antonio I'll bring you something. - She looks like a virgin. - She was very photogenic. - Which one is that? - This picture is awesome. Well that picture was... Let me see. It was taken in Caldas. Very nice. Your mom was very young and pretty. Had many suitors. My old lady dressed quite differently... ...not like the girls of that time. In those times people dressed differently, not like now. She never stopped being so femenine. Not a chance. And her way of being, she was so nice. She was one of the friends I loved the most. She was such a darling. Drink up the coke, Rodrigo. - Why do you have the photos? - You look kind of worn out. A little bit, not much. - What's wrong? - Nothing. My fingers are all fucked up, man. That's because I smoked all that weed this week. We went over there to do... - A job? - Yeah. But we lost and that guy... ...they shot him... ...and everybody jumped him and started kicking him. Watching that, man. The way it makes you feel. That has to be the most difficult fucking thing ever. What's up man? Is Adolfo here? Yeah, his in there. - Is he? - Yeah, what's going on? What's up? I need your help. Shit man, I'm worn out. - What's up? - I need to talk to you. You know what? The cops are looking for me. - How come? The cops are... - How come? What happened? What happened man? I don't know. I was going home and I saw them parked there. This guy is a real asshole, man. Why man, it's not my fault. - And did they catch you? - No way, I wouldn't be here. And you come running to our hideout? You're such an idiot! I guess it has to do with last night's job. They found out. I don't get it, why do you work with guys who don't know shit? That's not true. How could've I known he was a good for nothing. This kid is no good. I'm really fucking fed up with him. So, what now? - Hide me out here. - Have you gone mad? For real, man... What, you're going to be a giveaway for us too? Also the owner doesn't let... You know what, get lost. OK, cool. Thanks for nothing. If they saw you get here they'II get to you... ...and you rat on us you big mouth. - I'll go hide somewhere else. - That's the best you can do. Yeah, get lost! You ain't got no business here. You don't even know us. - What? - Yeah get lost! You got that right... Get lost, get lost. - Hide yourself. - That's what I'll do. This kid is a real bummer with so much bad shit, man. Which floor are you going to? - To the twentieth floor. - To see who? Mrs. Gloria Amparo Alarc?n. Go ahead. Where are you going? To the twentieth floor to see a lady. Yes? And what for? To give her a message. Adolfo! - Adolfo! - Hello. What's up? - I saw that guy Caliche. - What Caliche? - The dead guy, dickhead. - That guy is gone. Sure thing, he was hanging out... ...over there by [Chandi. - Yeah? - Like I'm telling you, dude. He looked at me the same way... ...and he smiled the same way... ...but his nose was different - That dude was there? - Sure man. I don't know. But he stared at me like... ...he wanted to say hi. I'm sure that it wasn't him, I'm telling you. And why should I get lost? I'm in my own house. It's your house but it's also mine... ...so put up with me. Put up with you? I can't even put up with myself. If it were up to me I'd be long gone... ...but here I am. - Yeah, go ahead, get lost. Put up with me and I'll put up with you. Get lost that you're getting me all horny. I' not leaving. I came out for fresh air and I'm staying. Well, at least go get dressed. Did you go to John's funeral? No way, man. That was a complete bore! - And you? - No way. - To watch people cry? - Funerals are such a bore. Yeah, you're right. I don't like watching sad people. Everybody crying. That's a complete bummer. Everybody so sad, what a bore. You know what I don't want anyone going to my funeral. You know what? I want to go down and stiff someone. Sure, it's been a long time since the last scare. I want to test this one. It's been days since I last used it. Don't you think so? Do you have yours here? Yeah? So, let's go down don't you think? [BIood on the shirt. Lying on the stretcher. [You won't save yourself. You won't save yourself. This thing is awesome, man. Hey, man look. - Hey man. - What's going on? You know who was over there? I saw Ramon, man. Ramon just went by over there by the store. No way, he should be hiding. Go check it out. Go on after him. You know what, Adolfo? Let's all go. We're going to make that fag pay. That guy is a complete asshole. Sure. - Hey, Ramon. - What's up, man. - Didn't I tell you to scram? - Yeah. I'll leave tomorrow. - Chill out. - You are not thinking. Get lost man, the guys are coming now. I leave tomorrow. I've got all my clothes packed. Don't worry I leave tomorrow for Florencia. Don't get so jumpy man. Chill out. - Those guys are coming. - OK, good luck, man. Hey scum! You're bored with your life, aren't you? - What's going on? - Why haven't you left, fag? Cool it down, man. - Get lost at once. - Yeah get lost, now. - I'm leaving at once. - Get lost. - What's the problem? - Get lost, at once. - What's your problem, dudes? - Get lost, now. Scram!

[Kill yourself my friend. - Ramon! - What's going on, dude? - Weren't you leaving, asshole? - Sure. I'm leaving. - So, why haven't you? - But don't be so jumpy. If you want don't hide. Just get yourself a mask. Get a mask and you can hang around here. Fag. If you want we can do the favor to you, fag? We can hide you for good. Don't worry. I'll hide myself. What a big shot! Ain't you something, fag! He's dead all right. Let's go. Let's get out of here. This guy is dead. Let's get out of here. [This film is dedicated to the memory of... [...
