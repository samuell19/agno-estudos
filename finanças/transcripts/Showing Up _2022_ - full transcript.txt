Hello, Lizzy. Hi, dad. My show opens Monday. That's a week from tomorrow. Put it on your calendar. Well, I don't think I got an invitation. Unless it got lost in the junk mail. So much junk mail coming in all the time. Have you seen the fake handwriting they have now? Looks like someone really wrote it by hand. Dad, this is your invitation. I haven't had time to send anything out. Uh, well, we'll all be there. My guests have come wandering through again. They'd love to have an outing, I'm sure. I don't like that they're staying with you again. They like it here. It's a good spot for them to stop. They were just there. Don't they have anywhere else they can stay? I enjoy the company. Feels like they're taking advantage of you. No. No. No. I'm gonna stop by this week and make sure they don't have you tied up in the basement. Nothing as exciting as that, I assure you. Though that would possibly be quite enjoyable. I could do without their dog though, not a well-trained creature. Keeps mistaking the corner of my couch for a tree. Dad, that's gross. Hey Lizzy. Check it out. Been hoping to find a good tire for this tree for ages. Jo, the water situation is getting worse. Barely gets lukewarm now. Just a few minutes of lukewarm and then cold. That sounds serious. I'm on it. Just got to get through this week first. Shouldn't even be here right now. I've got so much to do. I do, too. And I don't know what I'm supposed to do without hot water. Lizzy, I told you, you can use my shower. I want my own water working. My show's open on Friday. I'll be free to deal with it after that. I have a show too, you know. I'm just... You're not the only one with a deadline. I know, but I have two shows which is insane. Hey! Give me a push. You're hungry? Well, you have to wait. You're out of food. I have to work. I'll go to the store later. Fine. Ugh, shut up! God, Ricky, you're ruining my workday. This is Todd-a-phonic time. Happy Monday to you all. Counting the days until the Quazi show on the roof of the... Eric! Hey! A whole year of my life. Let's see it. I love it. What did you end up doing with the zipper? Well, I abandoned the zipper idea and went with Velcro. Which, like you said, is not great... Come here, let me help. ...because it sticks to the yarn. Yeah, it gets a little messy, but... Hey, Lizzy, can I get a little bit of coffee, please? This isn't a cafeteria. Okay, but, like... Could you at least tell me who's on my board? Hasn't been decided yet. Look, Randal, he shouldn't be on my board. We don't see eye-to-eye. We got, like, different theories of cultural production. Or he just doesn't like me. I don't know. I'm just putting that out there. - Hey, man... - Hey. Big piece on Marlene Heyman. "...devotional, humble, luminous and strange..." "She sees glass as a religious vessel "for personal mastic meditation." Wow, major real estate. "The dream like glass would seem like..." Lizzy. Uh, let's get the, uh, latest, um, end-of-year schedule out today. Mmm. Oh, these are travel receipts for our guests. And, um, I gave Tim Hunter cash so the invoice is in there. Here you go. All right. Lizzy, you ready to fire this week? Yeah, yeah. There'll be a few stragglers though, is that okay? We'll make room. Just bring by what you have. It's all right. We'll make it work. Oh, I saw some of Jo's work at her studio yesterday. Wow, it just gives me such a lift. Pretty amazing. She'd be more amazing if she got my hot water working. Two weeks now. Hey, Lizzy, I've gotta get to class. Bring your stuff by. We'll make it work. He's on spherical mirrors... ...groovy oil lamps. Media heat. The heat of the technology. The human shadows. This mess of images. So, what does it all do? It blows our minds. Does somebody wanna go on the inside? Grace? Maya? I'm not gonna lock you in. This one, doesn't make me cringe. I had a special feeling about this one. You know, it's, uh, it's right where I wanted to be. Good form, but not too slick. There's spontaneity in that pot. It's its own thing. You know you're meeting with the dean at noon? -Yeah. Can you remind Jackie? -She knows. And I was wondering if it's okay if I take tomorrow off work? I was thinking I might do that. I'd have a lot of work. For the show. So is that okay? If I don't come in? Lizzy, if you're taking a personal day, you're taking a personal day. Okay, so I won't be in tomorrow. I got it. And have you talked to Dad? Because those people are back at his house again. What people? The people who stay with him. Well, your father is living his own life. And we all wish him the very best. Lizzy, I'm focusing here. I can't figure out what class this is. But I really want to join it. Thinking and Movement. Ah. You're Lizzy, right? You made that nice flyer. I haven't gotten to read the article yet, but I made the flyer. Cool. Well, thank you. I want to impress those students. And the flyer was very nice. Thank you. Yeah, see you around. ...in store for us and I can't wait to listen. But while I wait to listen, let's listen to... This is, like, the, uh... Mike Bloomfield, Al Kooper super session... Hey, you, leave a message. Hey, Sean, checking in. My show opens on Monday. It's at Lauren's again. If you're not busy maybe you'll come. Okay. Well... Talk to you later. Bye. Hey. Hey. They said they were doing a catalogue and now they're like, "Oh, it won't be ready before the opening." Only our school would do that. God. - Lame. - So lame. Abigail Firschein spotlight show. If there's no catalogue, it's just my thesis show all over again. Who cares? It'll happen. Things usually get done, just not on time. Yeah, we'll see. Oh, no. Ricky! Ricky! Ricky! Ricky! No. No. No! Bad cat! Ricky! Ricky! Bad cat, bad cat. Get out. Shit. Oh... Oh, you dumb bird. Ooh... Off you go. Go somewhere else. Go die somewhere else. Jesus, I'm bad. Ricky, you are bad! Bad. Shit. Lizzy. Check it out. Found this poor bird. What? I found a bird. Check it out. Hey... Yeah... We're good. You're good. Oh, a pigeon. I think it was mauled by a cat. It was flapping around out back in the flowerbed. His wing is messed up. Broken, I think. Poor little guy. Look at this guy. You're okay... Hold him a sec. I think it was Oscar who did it. That cat is a menace. They really need to keep him inside. Come on, let's fix this guy up. Jo... I think this should be good. Yeah. Okay. Okay... Does that look good? I think so. Okay, we need a box. Okay... Wait. Okay. All right. Ah, the People Tower. I probably made this Freshman year. That's a classic. Okay... There you go. Perfecto! What are we gonna do with you, huh? What are we gonna do? I gotta get to work. Hey, Lizzy, what are you doing today? Me? Working in the studio from home. I got a lot to do. I have to install at Nationale. Jo, I have a cat. Ricky is upstairs, the bird can hang with you in the studio. I took today off to work. Aw, this guy is no trouble. Right? Yeah, I guess. Wow, super! You're amazing. I'll get him back from you as soon as I get home. You're the best. Okay. Oh, yeah, you've done enough already. Sorry. Gross. What's the matter? Why are you panting? Hey, it's Jo. Leave a message. Hi, Jo, your bird is acting weird. I don't think it's breathing right. Call me back. What, are you having a heart attack or something? So much to do today, Mr. Bird, you're not helping. Jo, your bird is acting weird. I don't think it's breathing right. Call me back. Looks like somebody did a good job with the bandaging. What about the heavy breathing? He's a little stressed. I'm not going to bother him. Have you been keeping him warm? Birds like to be kept warm. I work in a garage studio. It's not cold. It stays cool, but... I've been glazing down there, but that's not too stinky. Well, maybe the studio is not the best place. You could put a hot water bottle in the box. Uh, do you have one? Get one at the drug store. Fill it with hot water. No hot water at my place. Going on two weeks now. Do you have a stove? I have a stove. Heat some water in a kettle or a pot, just wrap it in a towel. You don't want it too hot, but comfortable. That's all? It's a pigeon. I owe you some beers. Hi. How's the bird? Cost $150. I put it on my credit card. I need to be paid back. A hundred and fifty dollars? Wow, what'd they do to him? It's my one big day for working and it got totally screwed up taking care of your bird. I'm sorry about the day. You can take the money off the rent. Doesn't get me back the time. She's amazing. Love the green stockings. So cool. Awesome. Anything else I should know? About the bird? I got some bird seed. $3.99. Okay. Thanks for taking care of him. Come on, petit oiseau. You're coming over to my place. We'll have a nice time. Say bye to Lizzy. Bye bye, Lizzy. Bye, Lizzy. Good move getting here early. You got your own kiln. I had to pull an all-nighter. All right... You can take them up to cone six. Cone six. She's great. Maybe soak them a while. Okay. I can do that. How many more pieces we got coming? Uh, just one. I'm almost there. Okay. Be quick with it. Great framing... How's the bird? Seems all right. Got him over by the window. I'm gonna take him to the office. It's loud in here. Okay. What's this? A bird. That's a pigeon. Adorable. What happened? Jo found it. The vet thinks it has a broken wing and is stressed out. What's this? Something Ned Halter ordered. Well, it looks personal. Tell Ned he can pick it up in my office. You took a pigeon to a vet? Now that's crazy. Okay, go, thank you. You're off duty. Miss, I'm from Tacoma. We shoot pigeons with BB guns. We don't take them to the vet. Yo, Lizzy took a pigeon to the vet. She thinks the pigeon is stressed out. Before he journeyed... ...in his spaceship to the Moon in 1971, Starfield astronaut Allan Shepard didn't think he'd be... Hey, kiddo. -For you. -Ooh, thank you come in. My captors are dying to meet you. Lee, Dorothy, my daughter, Lizzy. So, this is Lizzy! Wonderful to meet you. We've heard all about you. Dorothy and Lee have just come down from Canada. Yeah, we were standing in the gardens of Victoria. Last week? -So beautiful. -Really beautiful. Have you been? No. Yes, you have. You were there when you were little. Oh, okay. Well, yes, then. Well, excusez-moi. I must go to the toilette. Oh, Bill, shall Lee make some coffee? Knock yourself out, my dear. You're about out of coffee by the way. And we're running low on 1% milk, if we're making a list. Oh, that's your middle of the night cereal eating. Well, she's got me there. Dad, how long are they staying? Oh, I don't know. Well, where do they live anyway? They winter in Mexico and summer in Canada, they're very free. Mom says "Hi", by the way. Oh, really? Well, "Hello" in return. How's your show shaping up? Great. Oh, that's wonderful. Wonderful. If you see anything you like that you want, by all means, just take it. You should make more like this. I'm enjoying my retirement. I don't believe you. Well, it's true. Well, you should do it anyway. Nah, my days are full. I get up, I do a little of this, a little of that, and before you know it, it's time to watch TV again. That sounds terrible. That suits me just fine. I can't find it. I put it aside, but, um, must just got up and walked away. Come on, let's go join our friends again. Dad, those aren't your friends. You barely know those people. Well, look at you. You've been there all the time. Here, would you, uh, give this to your brother when you see him again? For five years, he lived in that jacket. I mean, it was mine, but he took possession. He might like it again. -Yeah, I remember this. -Yeah... Have you talked to Sean? I talk to him all the time. -C'mon, let's go... -When's... When's the last time you talked to him? He brought a delicious stuffing for Thanksgiving. It was ravishing. Let's go. Dad... Dad, that was six months ago. Well, he was great six months ago. And his stuffing was superb. All right. Okay. You ready? Yeah, ready. Beautiful. You're right. Yeah. Just love them. Good job, Eric. Good job, girls. Hey. This is your stuff? Yeah, these are mine. I didn't know you did this. How great. They look so good. Wow, each one, so wonderful. They came out well, huh? Um, do you have time tomorrow? Uh, shouldn't be a problem. The earlier the better. Hello, Jo. How are you, dear? Hi, Jean. I'm good. I think so, anyway. How are things at Nationale? Uh, I think I'm done here and there. I think the shows speak to each other in a really cool way. Bravo! The Abigail Firschein Memorial Show, it's really such a big deal and... Oh, we couldn't be prouder. The... The first OCAC alum they've ever featured. Well, that must feel good. I hope the catalogue comes together in time. Yes, me too... Oh, we are thrilled to be honoring you. We're... We're doing a catalogue? Did you know Jo Tran is getting a catalogue? Hey, I can take the bird. I'm gonna go get something to eat with Jackie and then go home. He can hang in the car for a bit. He's fine here. I'll drop him off when I come home. Okay, I'll take him later then. -Hey, Jo... -Hey. You're coming to my opening tomorrow, right? Yeah, definitely. Uh, Lizzy, do you have any dental floss? Hey, Jim, can you let me into the guest bathroom? You're not supposed to be in there. My hot water is still broken. I really need a shower. I'll get the key, but you're not supposed to be in there. I got your door unlocked. I don't want any messes in there. No puddles. - Hi. - Hi. I'm cooking. Come on in. Brought you this coat. It's from dad's. He thought you'd like it. And here's an invite to my show, too, if you want. I left you a message. Yeah... You know I'm not a big message guy. What you making? Dinner of kings. Ragu. Thought I'd be here earlier, but so much traffic. People don't know how to drive. Yeah, I almost got hit the other day. Not surprised. What's going on? I lost Channel 4. Oh. It's the only channel I like to watch. Has all the old shows on it. Hawaii 5-0. Twilight Zone. The good stuff. But now it's just gone. Can you call the company? I don't have a company. I use the antenna. I know what's going on. What's going on? You don't want to know. The neighbors blocked it. Can they do that? They figured it out. I don't... I don't know if that's something they can really do. You don't think so? Believe me, they can. And they do. Those people have their fingers all over this place. Go see for yourself. Hey, I saw your car and I thought I'd say "Hi". Hey, Craig. -Hi, Sean. -It's Craig. Oh, hey. I thought you were the other neighbors. Sean was just telling me about his TV reception, that he's missing his shows. Still not working? Nope. Thinks the neighbors have something to do with it. I see what you're doing. See what you're trying to pass along. Ha-ha. Nice try. Not passing anything along, Sean. If you want, I could get you a box set of The Twilight Zone. Have that on DVD. That's not the same if I know what's coming on. Oh, yeah, I remember that jacket. Yeah, same one. Is he still doing that landscaping thing? I thought he had some work. I don't think so. Not for a while. I rescued a bird. He has a broken wing. Wow... Cool. Oh, he has his struggles. I am aware. He could use our love. He needs more than that. He's a genius is part of the problem. Always a few steps ahead of everyone. Just makes it so hard to know what to expect. I don't know that he's a genius. Well, he really has something. A lot of people say that. They always have. Some people. He was always incredibly creative and, uh, some of the things he's done, just... Wow. A lot of people are creative. You should give him a little more credit. I do give him credit. I just think he has problems. I know... But really who doesn't? All right, get out. Get away. You're running. Go! You're running fast. Go, go, go, go, you're running for your lives. You're running for your lives. Go, go! Bye, thank you. -Bye, Marlene. -See ya. Thank you. Hey, Lizzy. Hi. Come to slum around in studio arts? Oh, no. No, just hiding, really. Oh, cool. You can hide in here with me. So, you share a house? Oh, no... God. We're neighbors. Jo bought an old apartment building. Dad and her brother helped her fix it up. Well, that sounds great. Yeah, she really figured it out. She can work in the studio all the time now. I saw you have a show coming up. Monday. I have a friend in town from New York. We'll come check it out. Cool. Nah... Fuck, my phone. Find it in the morning. Okay. Fun night? It was all right. A lot of people. Everyone loved it? That's what they said. Sorry I couldn't be there, but I saw the room. It looked amazing. I talked to Marlene Heyman for a long time last night. She really likes you. Went on and on about your girls, the colors. Mmm, that's cool. It is cool. She's having a moment. Anyway, I can take the bird off your hands. Okay. Ricky will be happy. Paper gets gross really fast. Okay. Hey, Jo, now that your shows are open, you'll get on the water heater, right? Yup. 'Cause I'd really like to take a shower. Yeah. All right, this one turned out beautiful. Good work. Good work. Come on, bae. Ahh! Must've been burning hot on one side. It's a little funky, but... I don't mind imperfections. In fact, I like them. I prefer it. Think it looks cool. -Don't you? -Not really. What? What's going on? Oh. What are you doing here? Just came by... I was gonna show you something. But you look sort of busy. What are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? I'm making a piece. It's a very major piece. Very major. I didn't know you were into earth work. Art is the earth talking. Poetry is the voice of the earth. So, it's all earth work. These are mouths. Listen. You have to listen to what isn't being said. You hear that? I don't think I do. So many people choose not to hear. Sean... Okay... - Hello. - I'm at Sean's. Things are not good here. He's not good... He's really off... Hey. So, where is he? Still in the backyard, I think. No, you... You go home. -I can... I can go with you. -No, please. Lizzy... You go home. Whoa... Yeah. Best thing I've ever seen. -I mean it. -Thank you. Wow. Technique, um... I mean, it was just a momentary thing... Who is this? What's this? Oh, really, just, like, the worst. But I think you should look at her earlier work because, I think, that's actually what... This idea of, like, post feminism ideal. Oh, I would. I think it's actually a pretty good piece, come on. - I need to see it. - Yeah, yeah. This is Jean. Leave a message. Mom, what's going on over there? Can you fill me in? Hey, it's Jo. Leave a message. Hey, one of your guests took my parking space. That is not cool. Also, just reminding you that the bird needs his paper changed every few hours. Gets pretty gross in there if you don't change the paper. This is Jean. Leave a message. Mom, I'm really anxious to know what's going on there. Give me a call. Hey, it's Jo. Leave a message. You know, I'm so fucking sick of not having hot water, Jo. It is such a total drag. And such a shitty thing to do to a person. I'm sick of it. Have a great night. I need to use the shower, too. Here? That shower is a storage space. It's packed. Well, I don't have any hot water and I need a shower. We'll figure it out. What's going on? Why haven't you called me back? Well, it's been busy here. Are you still there? I just left. He was finally sleeping. He had a lot to say. Are you sure that he's asleep? Well, he was quiet. He was resting. Okay. Well, call me later. Bye. Hey. Hey. Where's the bird? Inside. You left him alone? He's fine. The hot water bottle doesn't even - stay hot that long. - Lizzy... It isn't even cold out. When's my hot water coming back on? I'm on it. Well, you keep saying that, but... What are we talking, tomorrow? I have to drive out to Kelso to get the new heater, and the guy said he won't be there tomorrow. But he's supposed to be there the next day. Is that the only water heater anywhere? Why does it have to be that one? It's the best and cheapest, yeah. I pay rent, you know? Not that much. What? I said you don't pay that much rent, that's all. You have a really good deal. It's no excuse for the water. But you do. And, please, stop leaving me messages like that. All right. This is a lot of cheese and I don't think that people are gonna eat this much. They'll eat a little bit of it and then the rest of it is gonna go to waste. Lizzy, your guests are gonna be here in a few minutes. It's going to be a special night and no one is going to be looking at the cheese. Okay, they're coming to celebrate you and all of your beautiful work. What's happening? I just wanted to let you know I'm driving over to Sean's. He said he'd come tonight, and so I'm bringing him along as my date. Okay, if you think he really wants to. Oh, he wants to. Of course he does. So, we'll see you soon. Okay. Bye. Sean's coming. He's not going to break anything, is he? Seems like you're not taking away any cheese. Hi, Dad. It looks amazing! Oh, boy. Oh, boy! Hi, Dad. Um, thank you for coming. How nice. It's close to downtown, that's nice. This gallery is first rate. I mean, it might not look like much, but they do some really great things here. Why don't you guys have a look? Or some wine? Ooh, don't mind if I do. - Go ahead. - Yeah. -Thank you. -Zinfandel... Thank you, thank you. One of those, please. Dates. Well, you are very daring with the colors. Yeah. Yeah. Hello there, Craig. Hi, Mrs. Carr. I was hoping to find Sean back here. Uh, no one answered the door. I don't think he's here. Oh! I'm to pick him up and I wonder where he is. Sometimes he... He walks through the park over to the corner store on 92nd. You know, it's just a funny thing. A decade makes all the difference. Yeah. Yes, and who's gonna tell... How they're gonna tell their stories? When I'm in my dream space, that's when it happens. I mean, like... I just flow, you know? I can do no wrong in that. At that point, it just happens. Hey. Hey, thanks for coming. Wouldn't miss it. Lizzy, this is Janet. Janet is the gallery director where I show in New York. Nice to meet you. Congratulations. I hear great things. Well, my best piece got closer to the fire than I wanted, but I didn't have any control over that. Well, things look great from here. Come on, at this stage, you've just got to own it. How often does something come out of the kiln looking just as you expected. Yeah, I guess... Jo. -You came. -Of course I did. I brought this guy. He wanted to say hi. Oh... He's seen you make it all. Yeah, okay. It looks good. Your dad's hilarious. I'm gonna look around. This one looks familiar. Yeah, that's me. Cute. Have you swum with the dolphins? Twice. How much it cost? -What? -I don't remember. I mean, she was just a snob. Such a snob. Oh, my God. A first-class snob. Your dad is talking about Hilda Morris. You like her stuff? Yeah, I love Hilda. I just, kind of, fell into that. My pal did the cabinets in her living room and he said she didn't have a good word for anybody. For anybody. Lizzy, it looks wonderful, just wonderful. Congratulations. This is Lizzy's mom, Jean Carr. Davis. Jean Davis. The other thing about her was this leather vest. She loved this leather vest. She would not be seen without her leather vest. You talking about Hilda Morris? -Yes, I am. -You never knew Hilda Morris. I beg to differ. No, I don't think you did. -Mom, where's Sean? -I don't know. I couldn't find him. Well, that's his loss. You know this other friend of mine has a house... I thought you were getting him. Well, he wasn't there. And I... I thought he might be here. He shouldn't just be out by himself. Mom, that's not good. I'm sure he's fine. He's probably at a friend's. Sean doesn't have any friends. Craig's a friend. Mom, he could be anywhere right now. Lizzy, please relax. This is your night. Try to enjoy yourself. Well, I'm not just gonna stand here while Sean has gone missing. Who said he's gone missing? Sean... Oh, there you are. I... I went to pick you up. I said I was coming. I took the bus. I thought we said that I was getting you. No matter. -Hey. -I'm happy you're here. Here I am. Try picking up your phone once in a while. Easy on the cheese. What do you mean? It's for everyone. I don't want to run out. Cheese is out on the table. You shouldn't put cheese out on the table if you don't want people to eat it. -This isn't dinner, Sean. -It's my dinner. Leave the cheese alone, seriously. Sean, uh, have you spoken to Craig? -Uh, he was looking for you. -What did he want? Stop it. Yeah, they came to the Derick Tibbs show. Late... I think they do it on purpose. Kind of just come. And then leave. Hello, Sean! Finally, huh? Hey, Lizzy, I... I just wanted to tell you, I... I really like your friend Janet. And, uh, and she said she wants to come and see, uh, my pots, if you know what I'm saying. Oh, my God, did you say that to her? No, I didn't have to say anything. She offered. That was to get you to leave. No, it was not to get me to leave, Jean. We had a meeting of the minds, all right? We have a lot in common. Well, we do. We do. As it turns out, we do. You're not supposed to have any cheese. Who the hell are you? I can eat as much as I want. Oh, Lizzy, the show is awesome. You should be so proud. Thanks, Terri. Thanks for coming. Yeah, of course. People sure love to kiss your ass, huh? Stop talking to me. Both of you please stop. You're embarrassing me. All right, all right, all right. Leave them alone, will you? You don't have to tell them how to talk to each other. What I say to them doesn't really concern you. Concerns me in that I'm here and I have to listen to it. No one, but you in there, Bill. No, you're standing in your own little world, Jean. Listen, buddy, don't you begin to tell me how to talk to my kids. Oh, I wouldn't dare. Not like she'd listen anyway. Bird! Wow. No, Sean, wait! I guess he was ready to go. Gonna go to get some cigarettes. Saw Mike's show yesterday. How was it? It was good. I heard he's doing deserts again. Yeah... I liked his trees better. I like the deserts. I always forget Mike's color blind. Isn't that weird? Totally.
