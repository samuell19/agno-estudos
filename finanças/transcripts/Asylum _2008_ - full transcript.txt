''Man is the most advanced animal on Earth.'' Charles R. Darwin - 1 858 My name is Jack.J-A-C-K. Actually, it's Jean-Jacques. Ever since I can remember, I've wanted to be a gangster... probably from watching films. For the moment, I'm still small-time. But it's enough to live on. Starting out, that's what counts. Later, I hope to join a major outfit... one everybody respects. But it's not that easy. In the meantime, I do what I can. Sorry, to stay in, you have to raise. That's all l have. l didn't know the starting stakes were so high. So you fold? Hold on. Let's work it out. My watch. lt's worth a lot. Sorry. Besides, in the next round, l add a bullet and the stakes double. Anyway, l'm sure to win. Here's what we'll do... You okay with that? No deal. So you fold? - lt's okay. - There we go. The client can wait until tomorrow. Gentlemen. Remember that the barrel holds six bullets. l put in two, so you have two empty chambers and two bullets left. Damn. Before shooting, remember there's only one empty chamber left. You'd better be damn lucky. Go on. Go on. You lose. Sorry. lf you shoot, you're sure to get a bullet. At least you leave on two legs. - Not everyone's that lucky. - Shit. Fucking hell. - That was close. - Yeah. Damn, he was tough. l thought he'd shoot anyway, to save face. That's totally his style. We're lucky he didn't. All right, listen. We'd better cool it for a while because we've been pulling in a lot. Listen. Don't worry. l don't bring just anybody, you know. l knew he'd be big bucks. He's nobody, a fucking show-off. Okay, you're right. Well, l'll take care of this. Let me know, okay? Okay. Help. Know anybody who sells dope? l'm not sure. Check with that guy Vittorio. - You never know. - Vittorio? Yeah. He'd sell his own mother. Who cares? lt's just business. We don't care. Maybe you don't, but l'm no loan shark. What do you care? Look... it's the same thing. - Really? - Sure. No, l don't agree. We don't cheat the little guy. We're notJehovah's Witnesses. Don't start that shit again. So what are you? The kind who gives money to bums in the street? Why not? Sure, why not? Now listen up... imagine you run into a crew, okay? And the guy says, ''You're in, on one condition: See that priest? Steal the collection plate, okay?'' Would you do it? See? You're thinking. You think about it, you're screwed. They wouldn't want you. On a job, there's no time to think. That's how it is. - Check it out. - Good haul. Sure. - Plus the dope. - Yeah. - Expecting anybody? - No. You know who l am? That's what l thought. Amateurs. That makes it easier. lf you were professionals, you'd know who l am. You'd already be selling your mothers to pay me back. Just like my stupid fucking delivery boy... two hours ago, before l shot him. Just a second... We have no idea what you're talking about. You must be mistaken. He told me some bullshit... about being held up for my merchandise in an alley... so now... l'm ready for some solid truth. Like where you hid my drugs. You mean that blond guy... the sharp dresser? l hardly know him. We met in a bar and got to talking. He wanted to play cards and l introduced him to some friends. He played, he lost. He never mentioned delivering drugs. l don't even know his name. ls that enough? Want me to continue? You boys think you're gangsters. Let me tell you something. Know what sets us apart? This. When you can afford a cigar like this... you've made it. You smoke roll-ups now... and that makes all the difference. l'm serious. You aren't. So... l'm going to ask one last time: Where are the drugs you stole from me? Tell me now or l'll break your faces, shoot you, and feed you to my dogs. Wait, we'll-- Before, you said we were just starting out, right? That we're amateurs. But if l understand correctly, you're a big mafia guy. You smoke fat cigars. What kind? Havana? You should know something: The cigar was invented by homosexuals. lt's true. The cigar was invented by homosexuals to help spot each other. They thought, ''Men smoke cigarettes... so we'll smoke bigger ones. lt'll be like a club.'' That's why they say... ''Show me your big fat cigar.'' So that means l'm a fag? l didn't make it up. What an incredible story... So... who isn't serious? Us with our roll-ups... or you with your gay genes? No. Forget your pal. We'd have killed him anyway. You look more reasonable. Here's a bit of professional advice: Don't get caught. But you got caught... and like everybody who gets caught, you'll pay. You'll work for me. You'll kill someone for me. lt's me. l'm in the house. Nice place. Your mobster's here. So, what's the problem? lt's my first killing. l'm not used to it. l need your help. l'm not ready. It's simple, shoot him before he can react. You don't need my help. l never killed anyone. You're used to it. lt's your job. Otherwise, l'm outta here. l don't give a fuck, l quit. Fine. I'll help. Where is he? - ln the living room. - Okay. - l'm in the hallway behind him. - Check what he's doing. l can't see. His back is to me. He's working on something, l think. - Shit. - Calm down. We'll do it nice and easy. First, cock your gun. Then enter the living room... and sneak up behind him. Jam the muzzle in his neck and shoot. Here l go. l didn't mention it... but you must not be doing too well. Your house is cute, but it's nothing to shout about. Hi there. Pretty slick, the phone call. Gotcha. l'll have to start over. Little cocksucker. Maybe so, but l've got the gun. You could make serious cash with me. l was ready to let you join. What kind of fool do you take me for? Like l wouldn't check out the guy l'm supposed to snuff? According to my sources, compared to you, he's Lucky Luciano. On the street, you're just a rumor, no louder than a fart. Even if l managed to kill him, l'd be screwed. Either way, your problem's solved and l'm fucked. So, l decided to call him and offer to introduce you two. Funnily enough, he'd been wanting to meet you but didn't have your number. Right after that, they showed up to take care ofhim. I'd pulled off a nice one. I was pretty proud. Because of it, they offered me a chance to join their outfit... exactly the kind I was looking for. But before meeting the boss... I had to pass some kind of test. I wasn't the only one. They knocked us out so we wouldn't know where they took us. The trip was pretty long... and probably on winding roads because when I woke up, I felt nauseous. There we were, in the middle of the forest. You're here because you want to join our team. But you gotta earn it. lt takes hard work and luck... a shitload of luck. ln this job, you need both or you're screwed. We're testing you for jinxes. Bad luck's contagious, and we don't want any. Ready for the test? lt must be your lucky day. This hasn't happened in a while. Sorry, we finish off the wounded. No cripples. We're not a charity ward. No paybacks, either. Right, bro? I was damn lucky to be alive. I must really be made for this job. Before leaving, they blindfolded me and knocked me out again. It was then, when it all went dark... that suddenly, I had a weird feeling... that I'd have to return to that forest someday. There I was, finally, in front ofhim... the big boss. He runs this whole outfit and probably the whole city. I was supposed to kill him? I can't even look at him. Just his voice gives me the shivers. I thought of the stories I'd heard. They say he cut an associate's head off because he'd tried to cheat him. Then he sent a package to the guy's wife. Her husband's head was in it. Creepy shit, right? No way was I gonna fuck with him. No way are you gonna fuck with me. You made a nice play by handing over one of my main competitors. You'd already earned a point before meeting me... and in the forest, you proved you're lucky. That's nice. But you won't always be lucky... and you can't get away with everything. l have rules and they are non-negotiable. One: Follow orders. Two: No personal initiatives without checking with me. Three: No business on the side. Four: Don't steal from me. Five: Don't cheat me. Six: Don't fuck up. And seven: Don't fuck up. lf, by chance... you even think of breaking one of these rules... or commit the slightest error... your girlfriend, Sarah... will receive a nice package containing your head. l don't have a girlfriend. She left me. You've got a mother? Okay, then. Good news.:'on my first day... they told me I'd have an assistant. Now that's class. lf that guy can scare people just 'cause he's got a gun... - why not me? - Totally. What drew you to it? Watching your uncle work? Since l was a kid, it's always been part of my life. Right. Since you're family, they probably didn't test you. Lucky you. - Can l ask you something? - Sure. Does your uncle really behead guys who cheat him or is that a legend? ln my opinion, knowing my uncle, it's totally possible. Once, l was bugging him to let me work for him. This was a while ago. l really wanted to join. l needed money. But family is sacred to him. He didn't want me involved. He finally accepted... and my first job was to deliver a package to a lady. l don't know why... but just from the weight of the box, l knew something wasn't right. - Know what l mean? - Yeah, totally. - Did you open it? - No, l didn't want to. That way, l don't know. You gotta make people respect you, protect your rep. Damn straight. Would you take me on a job with you, so l learn the ropes? You can't go on a job without some basic skills. - Go on, show me. l want to learn. - Now? Yeah.Just the basics, it won't take long. Just show me how to do a hold-up, for example. - Teach you to do a hold-up? - Yes. A basic skill: intimidation. l'd rather ask you than my uncle. l see your point. The meeting's in an hour. We've got time. All right, take my gun and stick me up, okay? Pretend it's a small bank, like in the old days. - Take it. - Okay. You enter the room and aim at the wall, okay? Say something like, ''Hands up, assholes... or l'll blow you away.'' Okay. So... l enter and-- Don't forget to close the door, otherwise... Oh, right. l come in, close the door... ''Hands up, assholes, or l'll blow you away.'' Say ''nitwits,'' it sounds better. ''Hands up, nitwits, or l'll blow you away.'' Try ''Fucking nitwits.'' ''Hands up, fucking nitwits, or l'll blow you away.'' Then what do l say? lt's all about making a strong first impression. After that, it's in the bag. lf they see in your eyes that you're a stone-cold killer... it doesn't matter what you say, you'll get whatever you want. Got it. Then l ask for the money? Obviously. Tell them to empty the drawer. l come in, close the door, ''Hands up''-- Hold on. l've got an idea to make it more threatening. When you enter... twirl the gun like a cowboy. That'll look good, like you're a real pro. You want me to twirl the gun on my finger? - Bit risky, don't you think? - No. Just don't drop the gun, you'd look stupid. Go on, give it a try. lt's not easy. ''Hands up--'' Do l say it before or after? At the same time. Twirl while you say it. - lt's cooler. - Okay. But l'm not promising anything. l enter, close the door... and while twirling the gun-- lt's not easy-- ''Hands up, assholes--'' Shit. Only one option.:' Make the body disappear, fast. I'd forgotten all about him. He comes to pick up dope and sees me like this. I had no choice. Forget the body, now I have to disappear. But first, I had to get my stash. I'd saved a lot of cash and I wasn't leaving without it. I called the airport to reserve a ticket. I had to leave the country, fast. You awake? Watch him. l gotta piss. - What's gonna-- - Shut up. Freeze. - All done? - Yeah. Think he'll notice? Maybe not, but if he does, he'll be pissed. Know why you're here? You said it before... no one can hear us, right? Pretty smart. lt's a shame. He could've been one of us. But you fucked up, so we gotta put you down. Let me explain-- Don't waste your breath. We received an order. Period. You say you're the Pope? We don't give a shit. You think we like it? lt's no picnic for us. We gotta come all the way here, then dig your grave. - We gotta bury him? - You questioning orders? No, it's just a drag to shoot him and then dig. Hey, we always get the scut work. l'm sick of it. The boss told us to do it, so he must trust us, right? - Otherwise, anybody could've done it. - You snuff him, l'm fed up. What's your problem? Let him go? After what he did? No. But l'm not doing anything. - l see why your family left. - What about yours? l thought we were a team. Two options: Either we leave... or you shoot him and bury him on your own. You're fucking tiresome. - What's your plan? - We'll say we shot him and buried him. He won't come check. He's got better things to do. Listen up. lf we don't shoot you, you stay out of town, got it? - Got it? - Yes. Wait one hour before leaving, got it? - Okay, let's go. - Head down. - What a dumb fuck. - Classic. - Thought we'd argue over you? - We'd come all this way, then let you go? - As if!. - My cell's vibrating. Wait a sec. Hello? Yeah. Okay, fine. The boss? What'd he want? You're one lucky fuck. - He wants us to bring him back alive. - Why? Something about some cash. Fucking hell. l could've spent the day in bed with my lady. l fucking told you, head down. Get up. Get up. What a dickhead. You're good. Nothing to it. Respect, man. Now you know who you're working with. He fell for it twice. There's no reception out here. What are you, stupid? Let's get down to business. You really fucked up with the boss. He's pissed off, but he decided not to kill you. Hey, l'm not kidding. But pretty soon, you'll wish l was. What you're in for is worse. His order is to leave you here to die. We're gonna chain you up like a dog... with only your memories to keep you company. Let you think about all the shit you did to end up here. That's it. That's how it ended for me. Watching movies made me want to be a gangster... and now I'm in a horror movie. I thought it was the end, the end of me. I was wrong. It's just beginning. DAY 2 Anybody there? DAY 3 TOO FAR FORYOU No. Motherfuckers. DAY 5 lt's nothing, don't be scared. - Then stop shooting at me. - I was joking. Don't worry. l won't hurt you. Take off your mask, so I can see you. And stop filming me with your camera. l'll introduce myself. l'm the caretaker. l keep an eye out to make sure everything's okay. You don't make rounds very often. l've been here several days and my only visitors... are ticks and mosquitoes. l knew you were here. They told me. ls that so? How nice. That's cool. That changes everything. l came to say hello. Your boss hired me. Or your ex-boss, judging by your situation. l get paid to stay here year-round, guarding his ''estate'' as he calls it. Sometimes l get to play with the people he abandons here, like you. lt's not often, so l make the most of it. You people have strange ways of having fun. l'm chained up like a dog so now l'm a pet? - What's that? - My dog. He's starving. l've got to feed him. - Afraid of dogs? - Depends on the dog. And their master. Stop being fussy. l know what kind of guys get brought here. You're no angel if you're chained up. What about you, with your rifle? Part of my job. l never use it, but in case of problems-- The problem is l'm fucking chained up. - You gonna help or not? - l can't. lt's not my job. - Then why'd you come? - To keep you company. l don't need company. lf you're not gonna help, go feed your dog. You'll get more conversation from him than me. lf you want, we can play a game. l can't believe it. Am l nuts? Are you? l'm not here to play fucking games. You don't understand. l'm in charge here. lf l say, ''Let's play a game,'' we play a game. Got it? Coming. l'll even sweeten the deal: lf you win, l'll shoot at your chain, okay? Maybe l'll only scratch it, but it's better than nothing. You might get free, plus, it passes the time. lt's better than being all alone, right? What do you want me to do? l want to test your reflexes. lt sounds dumb, but it's really fun. You're gonna put your hand in front of the tree... and l'll stand back there with my rifle. l'll aim at your hand and you'll dodge the bullet. - Are you fucking nuts? - Rather die? No, you'd rather play. So let's play. Don't move your hand so much. How's that? l was joking. We haven't started yet. Okay, enough kidding. This is the real thing, okay? Fucking asshole. Shit. You win. Rematch? But you're cheating. Don't move your hand so much. l'm not cheating. Get in position. Okay, l'm putting my hand up. Hold on. How's that? Go on. Fucking asshole. Shit. Don't move, l'm coming. Damn it. You cheated. - But l keep my promises. - Are we done? No way. We play until l'm out of bullets. - Shit. - l'm having a great time. What a dumb fuck. Dumb fuck. He fucking deserved it. Come on. Come to papa. Come on. There you go... Yes. DAY 6 Break, you fucking chain. Fuck. It's nothing, don't be scared. - Then stop shooting at me. - I was joking. Don't worry. I won't hurt you. And stop filming me with your camera. Stop filming me. Stop filming. -Shit, give us a hand. -It's not my job. DAY 1 7 Okay. I don't know what day it is... but I've been here about... three weeks. My only visitor was the caretaker... nobody else. Not even a wild animal, nothing. Which is pretty weird, in a forest. Maybe they smell my traps and avoid the area. They're smart. And the fucking dog. He's waiting for a chance to attack... so I sleep with one eye open. Yesterday, l got lucky. lt rained a little. Very little. Lucky for me, 'cause I was getting really thirsty. Anyway... I buried the caretaker's body as best I could... by throwing dirt and leaves. I talked to him at first. We got along pretty well. But I ended up burying him because I was sick ofhis half-eaten face. It was pretty ugly. Sir? - Who are you? - Lower your gun-- No way. - Listen-- - No, you listen. For days l've been chained up like a dog, starving. l see you're chained to the tree. l'll take a look-- - Stay where you are. - Okay. - What are you doing here? - l'm totally lost. l was flying over this zone. Didn't you hear the helicopter? l broke down, over there. l made an emergency landing. You fly a helicopter? l fly people, show them the sights. l was heading home. - l don't believe you. - l swear. My helicopter's 200 yards away. - l'll just-- - You're not moving. lf l call for help, they'll save you too. Yeah, right. Let you go? Do l look like a fool? Are you keeping me here? l said you're staying here. Do not move. l'm not moving. Let's get to know each other. Then l'll decide. - On your knees. - Knees? Kneel. Sorry. What'd you put in it? What? The flask smells weird. What'd you put in it? Trying to poison me? l didn't do anything. You're nuts. What'd you put in the fucking flask? You're totally paranoid. You need help. Really? Go ahead, drink from the flask. lt's silly. There's not enough water for two. Don't worry about it. Open your mouth and drink or l'll kill you. Do it. Hurry up. Do it. That's it. That's a good boy. Happy? Yes. Don't worry. l've got time. Asshole. l'll get you. Thought you'd fool me? Nitwit. Knees? KneelI Sorry. Tell me what l want to know. What can l say? What's to know? The boss sent me, you know that. lt's been three weeks. He wanted to see how you were. You came all this way just to say hi? - Not too bright. - Asshole. l came to bury you if you were dead. Otherwise, my orders were to bury you alive. l was supposed to knock you out, dig a hole, put you in it... and wait till you woke up to throw in the dirt. May l? But things have changed. l'm giving the orders now. What'd you say? l missed that. Freeze. Listen up, here's the deal: You lower your weapon and dig your grave. l promise to kill you before l bury you. The only holes l dig are for animals. Look at you, asshole. You're the animal. Chained up... half dead, ready to be finished off. You're hungry and thirsty. You're tired. You don't stand a chance. Shit. Go on... get up. Go on. Not bad, my traps. Now who's the animal? Who got fucked? l never killed anybody, but if you pull another stunt like that... l swear l'll kill you. l won't take my eyes off you, got it? Yes. - Gonna watch me day and night? - Don't worry. l don't plan on staying here long. You're gonna be my pet... and like a good pet... you're gonna help your master. You think l'll help you escape? Dream on. Go ahead. Go on, kill me. Go on. lf l help you, l'm a dead man. So let me tell you something: if you so much as blink... or look away for a second... l'll jump you. Got it? Go ahead, fucker. Go ahead and try it. You're gonna slip up sometime. You're getting tired. lt'll wear you out. And unlike you, l'm in top shape. What are you gonna do now? l'll wait. What are you doing? Get over there. Hey, should l even ask what's for lunch? Do you intend to starve me to death? Don't like it? Complain to your boss. Very funny. You know, if you gave me some freedom... l could hunt, bring back some food. You're chained up... and the boss won't send anyone else, not for weeks. They dropped me by helicopter and he won't take any chances now. Tough luck. You're stuck with me. You'll end up like the caretaker. Like the... Caretaker. Nice. So that's why we haven't heard from him. For somebody who never killed... He fall out of a tree? That's it. Look, 1 80 pounds of meat right under our noses. Been dead long? l'm sure he's still good. We'll make a fire and grill some meat. How's that sound? l'm sure it's not so bad. When's the last time you ate? l'm hungry. l'll go-- Don't move, you fucking bastard. There's no way in hell l'm starving to death. You can die, rot and stink for miles. l don't give a damn. At least that might attract people. What people? No one comes here, asshole. Haven't you figured that out yet? l don't give a damn. l'm going. Fuck. What the fuck is that? You got too close to his master. Do something, damn it. - Shoot it. - Like l'd waste a bullet for you. Don't fuck around. l'll do whatever you say. - Help me escape. - Never. Then you're dog food. Ever since his master died, he's stressed out. He's lost his bearings. He's starving... Okay, l understand. Take care of him and l'll tell you how to escape. - Tell me. - Take care of him first. No way. Fucking hurry. He's gonna eat me, look at him. All it takes is a sudden movement-- Stop. Okay, okay. The key to your padlock is here. Where? Back there, hanging from a tree. You're lying. Those other guys put it there on purpose to piss you off. Understand? Think he'll notice? Maybe not, but if he does, he'll be pissed. Now, hurry up. Fuck. Why didn't you kill him instead of firing in the air? The bastard will probably be back. l'm scared of dogs, you know? Besides, did you see him? Fuck. Freeze. l told you l'd seize my first chance. Turn around. Slowly. Now l'll finish what l came to do. What'd you do with the pills, asshole? - l asked you a question. - l threw them away. Doesn't matter. l've got what l need. Bye-bye. lt's like Russian roulette. You gotta bluff to win. Asshole. You won't use me... Fuck. l'll find a road, hitch a ride and tonight, l'm back home. l beat them.
